{"title": "When I Was Your Man", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now\nOur song on the radio but it don't sound the same\nWhen our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down\n'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt all just sounds like oooooh ooh\nMmm, too young, too dumb to realize\n\n[Chorus]\nThat I should have bought you flowers\nAnd held your hand\nShould have gave you all my hours\nWhen I had the chance\nTake you to every party\n'Cause all you wanted to do was dance\nNow my baby's dancing\nBut she's dancing with another man\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways\nCaused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life\nNow I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)\nAnd it haunts me every time I close my eyes\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt all just sounds like oooooh ooh\nMmm, too young, too dumb to realize\n\n[Chorus]\nThat I should have bought you flowers\nAnd held your hand\nShould have gave you all my hours\nWhen I had the chance\nTake you to every party\n'Cause all you wanted to do was dance\nNow my baby's dancing\nBut she's dancing with another man\n\n[Bridge]\nAlthough it hurts\nI'll be the first to say that I was wrong\nOh, I know I'm probably much too late\nTo try and apologize for my mistakes\nBut I just want you to know\n\n[Chorus]\nI hope he buys you flowers\nI hope he holds your hand\nGive you all his hours\nWhen he has the chance\nTake you to every party\n'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance\nDo all the things I should have done\nWhen I was your man\n\n[Outro]\nDo all the things I should have done\nWhen I was your man\n\n", "author": "Bruno Mars"}
