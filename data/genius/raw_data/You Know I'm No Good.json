{"title": "You Know I'm No Good", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Meet you downstairs, in the bar and hurt\nYour rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt\nYou say \"What did you do with him today?\"\nAnd sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray\n'Cause you're my fella, my guy\nHand me your Stella and fly\nBy the time I'm out the door\nYou're ten men down like Roger Moore\n\n[Chorus]\nI cheated myself\nLike I knew I would\nI told you I was trouble\nYou know that I'm no good\n\n[Verse 2]\nUpstairs in bed with my ex-boy\nHe's in the place but I can't get joy\nThinking on you in the final throes\nThis is when my buzzer goes\nRun out to meet you, chips and pitta\nYou say, \"When we married\" 'cause you're not bitter\n\"There'll be none of him no more\"\nI cried for you on the kitchen floor\n\n[Chorus]\nI cheated myself\nLike I knew I would\nI told you I was trouble\nYou know that I'm no good\n\n[Verse 3]\nSweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain\nWe're like how we were again\nI'm in the tub, you on the seat\nLick your lips as I soak my feet\nThen you notice likkle carpet burn\nMy stomach drops and my guts churn\nYou shrug and it's the worst\nTo truly stuck the knife in first\n\n[Chorus]\nI cheated myself\nLike I knew I would\nI told you I was trouble\nYou know that I'm no good\n\nI cheated myself\nLike I knew I would\nI told you I was trouble\nYou know that I'm no good\n\n", "author": "Amy Winehouse"}
