Where my drink? This my day, lucky you\nFuck you too, woo!\n\n[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]\nY'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move\nGive me some room, give me some room, give me the juice\nHop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot\nY'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice\n\n[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]\nBack on my bullshit, my back to the wall\nTurn my back on you, all of you finished\nBack to these bullets, it's back to the job\nPull my MAC out and all of you runnin'\nBack on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'\nThese packs and I'm actually pumpin'\nCan't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'\nYou mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'\nI'm actually buzzin' this time\nStraight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine\nI do not fuck with you guys\nIf I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time\nI ain't no gangster but I got some bangers\nSome chains and some blades and a couple of nines\nChoppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree\nMy twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies\nI run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)\nThey say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)\nI live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)\nBitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)\nYou play your cards, I reverse on you all\nAnd I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)\nC\u00e1llate boca mejor, maric\u00f3n, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)\nThey've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old\nLookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now\nShit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down\nIn truth a nigga just really want me tied down\nI've been alone and I never needed nobody\nJust only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down\nKeep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle\nI just pray to God that my son'll be alright now\nI said ain't no love for the other side\nOr anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)\nWhen I die I'm goin' out as a underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)\nYou in the wrong cab down the wrong path\nNigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)\nSnakes in the grass tryna slither fast\nI just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)\n\n[Bridge: Eminem]\nI done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it\nThis is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it\nI done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em\nWasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition\nFuck's the difference?\nI'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules\nMan I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose\nI've been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full\nI just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me\nFuck you think? (Woo!)\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI got a couple of mansions\nStill I don't have any manners\nYou got a couple of ghost writers\nBut to these kids it don't actually matter\nThey're askin' me, \"What the fuck happened to hip-hop?\"\nI said, \"I don't have any answers.\"\n'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album\nIt hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers\nAnd actually comin' from humble beginnings\nI'm somewhat uncomfortable winning\nI wish I could say, \"What a wonderful feeling!\"\n\"We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!\"\nBut nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability\nTo even stick to a subject, it's killin' me\nThe inability to pen humility\nHa-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of\nFuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?\nFuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular\nShit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up\nDon't give an ounce of a motherfuck\nAbout the ones that were here before you that made rap\nLet's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks\nADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?\nWe need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back\n'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage\nAll the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap\nI don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad\nBut in fact, where the old me at? The same cat\nThat would take that feedback and aim back, I need that\nBut I think it's inevitable\nThey know what button to press or what lever to pull\nTo get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)\nAnd if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger\nBut you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)\nOn the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'\nEverything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits\nI'm asleep at the wheel again\nAs I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent\nOf another beat I'ma kill again\n'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again\nEven ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin\nIt better be at least 70 to 300 milligram\nAnd I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again\nLevels to this shit, I got an elevator\nYou could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker\nI sound like a broken record every time I break a record\nNobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater\nMotherfucker, now I got a right to be this way\nI got spite inside my DNA\nBut I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy\nIt's the moment y'all been waitin' for\nLike California wishin' rain to pour\nIn that drought, y'all been prayin' for\nMy downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw\nStill the same Marshall, that outlaw\nThat they say as a writer might've fell off\nI'm back on that bull like the cowboy\n\n[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]\nSo y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move\nGive me some room, give me some room, give me the juice\nHop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot\nY'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice\n\n", "author": "Eminem"}
