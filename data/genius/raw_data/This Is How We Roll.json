(come now)\nWe hanging round singing out everything on the radio, woah... (get your hands up, get your hands up, get your hands up)\nWe light it up with our hands up\nThis is how we roll\nThis is how we ride\nWe slangin' up the mud cuttin' through the country side, baby\nThis is how we roll...\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, this is how we roll\u2026 (this is how we roll)(yeah baby, lets go)\nThis how we roll, (this is how we roll\u2026)\nThis is how we do\nWe burnin down the night shootin bullets at the moon\nBaby this is how we roll\u2026 (BK, Tyler)\n(one more time, let\u2019s go)\nYeah this is how we roll (this is how we roll)\u2026\n\n", "author": "Florida Georgia Line"}
