{"title": "Witness", "type": "lyrics", "content": "If I lost it all today, would you stay?\nCould my love be enough to stimulate?\nIf shit hit the fan, grenades got thrown\nWould you still show, oh?\nCould you go down with me to the mat?\nCould we get back up and eventually laugh?\nRoll eyes at highs, cheers in the lows, and stay in the flow, whoa\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause I, I only got this life\nAnd I ain't got the time, no\nNot to get it right, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nWe're all just looking for connection\nYeah, we all want to be seen\nI'm looking for someone who speaks my language\nSomeone to ride this ride with me\nCan I get a witness? (witness)\nWill you be my witness? (witness)\nI'm just looking for a witness in all of this\nLooking for a witness to get me through this\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you tell me everything, and there's no holes\nYou can scroll through anything, you've got the codes\nNothing to hide, it's all in their eyes\nAnd we just know, whoa\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause I, I only got this life\nAnd I ain't got the time, no\nNot to get it right, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nWe're all just looking for connection\nYeah, we all want to be seen\nI'm looking for someone who speaks my language\nSomeone to ride this ride with me\nCan I get a witness? (witness)\nWill you be my witness? (witness)\nI'm just looking for a witness in all of this\nLooking for a witness to get me through this\n\n[Bridge]\nWill you be my witness?\nCould you be the one that speaks for me?\nWill you be my witness?\n\n[Chorus]\nWe're all just looking for connection (we're all just looking)\nYeah, we all want to be seen\nI'm looking for someone who speaks my language\nSomeone (to ride this ride) to ride this ride with me (with me)\nCan I get a witness? (witness)\nWill you be my witness? (witness)\n(Will you be my witness?)\nI'm just looking for a witness in all of this\nLooking for a witness to get me through this\n\n[Outro]\nOh-oh-oh-oh (ah)\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ooh-ooh\nHey (ah)\nOh-oh-oh\nHey\n\n", "author": "Katy Perry"}
