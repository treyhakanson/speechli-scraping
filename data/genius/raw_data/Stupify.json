I get stupefied!\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll the people in the left wing, rock\nAnd all the people in the right wing, rock\nAnd all the people in the underground, rock\nI find myself stupefied, coming back again\n\nAll the people in the high-rise, rock\nAnd all the people in the projects, rock\nAnd all \"La Gente\" in the barrio, rock\nI find myself stupefied, coming back again\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhy do you not like playing around with\nMy narrow scope of reality?\nI can feel it all start slipping\nI think I'm breaking down\n\nWhy do you not like playing around with\nMy narrow scope of reality?\nI can feel it all start slipping away\n\n[Chorus]\nSee, but I don't get it\nDon't you think maybe we could put it on credit?\nDon't you think it can take control when I don't let it?\nI get stupefied! \"It's all the same\", you say\n\nLive with it, but I don't get it\nDon't you think maybe we could put it on credit?\nDon't you think it can take control when I don't let it?\nI get stupefied! I get stupefied!\n\n[Interlude]\nTefached...\nTefached...\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd don't deny me\nNo, baby now, don't deny me\nAnd darling, don't be afraid\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I don't get it\nDon't you think maybe we could put it on credit?\nDon't you think it can take control when I don't let it?\nI get stupefied!\n\n[Outro]\nLook in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!\nLook in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!\nLook in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!\nLook in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!\n\nLook in my face, step in my soul\nLook in my face, step in my soul\nLook in my face, step in my soul\nLook in my face, step in my soul\n\nLook in my face! (Step in my soul)\nLook in my face! (Step in my soul)\nLook in my face! (Step in my soul)\nI begin to stupify!\n\n", "author": "Disturbed"}
