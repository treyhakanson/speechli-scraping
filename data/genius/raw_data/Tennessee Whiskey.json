{"title": "Tennessee Whiskey", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Used to spend my nights out in a barroom\nLiquor was the only love I'd known\nBut you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom\nAnd brought me back from bein' too far gone\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're as smooth... as Tennessee whiskey\nYou're as sweet as strawberry wine\nYou're as warm as a glass of brandy\nAnd honey, I stay stoned, on your love all the time\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've looked for love in all the same old places\nFound the bottom of a bottle's always dry\nBut when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it\n'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd you're as smooth... as Tennessee whiskey\nYou're as sweet as strawberry wine\nYou're as warm as a glass of brandy\nAnd honey, I stay stoned, on your love all the time\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're as smooth... as Tennessee whiskey\nYou're as sweet as strawberry wine\nYou're as warm as a glass of brandy\nAnd honey, I stay stoned, on your love all the time\n\n[Outro]\nYou're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey\nTennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey\nYou're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey\nTennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey\n\n", "author": "Chris Stapleton"}
