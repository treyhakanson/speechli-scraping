{"title": "Car Radio", "type": "lyrics", "content": "I ponder of something great\nMy lungs will fill and then deflate\nThey fill with fire, exhale desire\nI know it's dire, my time today\n\n[Chorus]\nI have these thoughts so often, I ought\nTo replace that slot with what I once bought\n'Cause somebody stole my car radio\nAnd now I just sit in silence\n\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes quiet is violent, I find it hard to hide it\nMy pride is no longer inside\nIt's on my sleeve, my skin will scream\nReminding me of who I killed inside my dream\nI hate this car that I'm driving, there's no hiding for me\nI'm forced to deal with what I feel\nThere is no distraction to mask what is real\nI could pull the steering wheel\n\n[Chorus]\nI have these thoughts so often, I ought\nTo replace that slot with what I once bought\n'Cause somebody stole my car radio\nAnd now I just sit in silence\n\n[Verse 3]\nI ponder of something terrifying\n'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind\nI find over the course of our human existence\nOne thing consists of consistence\nAnd it's that we're all battling fear\nOh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here\nOh my, too deep - please stop thinking\nI liked it better when my car had sound\nThere are things we can do\nBut from the things that work there are only two\nAnd from the two that we choose to do\nPeace will win and fear will lose\nAnd there's faith and there's sleep, we\nNeed to pick one please because\nFaith is to be awake\nAnd to be awake is for us to think\nAnd for us to think is to be alive\nAnd I will try with every rhyme\nTo come across like I am dying\nTo let you know you need to try to think\n\n[Chorus]\nI have these thoughts so often, I ought\nTo replace that slot with what I once bought\n'Cause somebody stole my car radio\nAnd now I just sit in silence\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd now I just sit in silence\nAnd now I just sit in silence\nAnd now I just sit\nAnd now I just sit in silence\nAnd now I just sit in silence\nAnd now I just sit in silence\nAnd now I just sit\n\n[Verse 1]\nI ponder of something great\nMy lungs will fill and then deflate\nThey fill with fire\nExhale desire\nI know it's dire\nMy time today\n\n[Chorus]\nI have these thoughts so often, I ought\nTo replace that slot with what I once bought\n'Cause somebody stole my car radio\nAnd now I just sit in silence\n\n", "author": "\u200btwenty one pilots"}
