So bad\nIs it weird that I'm drunk and on my sofa?\nIs it weird that I'm naked on my sofa?\nAll alone, damn, I wish I didn't know ya\nIs it weird? So weird\n\n[Pre Chorus: Luke]\nI know I\u2019m the stupid one who ended it\nAnd now I'm the stupid one regretting it\nIt took me a couple drinks to admit it\nI know I\u2019m the stupid one\n\n[Chorus: All]\nThinking about you lots lately\nHave you been eating breakfast alone like me?\nThinking about you lots lately\nOr are you moving along?\nBeen thinking about you lots lately\nHave you been feeling empty beds just like me?\nI've been thinking about you lots, lately\nOr are you moving along?\n\n[Verse 2: Luke]\nIs it wrong if I ask you to come over?\nIs it wrong if I tell you that I love ya?\nEven though I'd never do it when I'm sober\nIs it wrong? So wrong\n\n[Pre Chorus: Luke]\nI know I\u2019m the stupid one who ended it\nAnd now I'm the stupid one regretting it\nIt took me a couple drinks to admit it\nI know I\u2019m the stupid one\n\n[Chorus: All]\nThinking about you lots lately\nHave you been eating breakfast alone like me?\nThinking about you lots lately\nOr are you moving along?\nBeen thinking about you lots lately\nHave you been feeling empty beds just like me?\nI've been thinking about you lots lately\nOr are you moving along?\n\n[Bridge: Ashton & Luke]\nScared of moving on, but you're already gone\nSo if you\u2019re moving on, won't you just tell me\nScared of moving on, but you\u2019re already gone\nSo if you\u2019re moving on, won't you just tell me\n\n[Chorus: All]\nThinking about you lots lately\nHave you been eating breakfast alone like me?\nThinking about you lots lately\nOr are you moving along?\nBeen thinking about you lots lately\nHave you been feeling empty beds just like me?\nI've been thinking about you lots lately\nOr are you moving along?\n\n[Outro: Michael & Luke]\nScared of moving on, but you're already gone\nSo if you\u2019re moving on\nAre you moving along?\n\n", "author": "5 Seconds of Summer"}
