Hey, are you ready for this?\nAre you hanging on the edge of your seat?\nOut of the doorway the bullets rip\nTo the sound of the beat, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnd another one gone, and another one gone\nAnother one bites the dust, yeah\nHey, I'm gonna get you too\nAnother one bites the dust\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow do you think I'm going to get along\nWithout you, when you're gone\nYou took me for everything that I had\nAnd kicked me out on my own\nAre you happy, are you satisfied?\nHow long can you stand the heat?\nOut of the doorway the bullets rip\nTo the sound of the beat\nLook out\n\n[Chorus]\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnd another one gone, and another one gone\nAnother one bites the dust\nHey, I'm gonna get you, too\nAnother one bites the dust\n\n\n[Bridge]\nHey\nOh, take it\nBite the dust, hey\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust, ow\nAnother one bites the dust, hey hey\nAnother one bites the dust, hey-eh-eh\nOoh\n\n[Verse 3]\nThere are plenty of ways you can hurt a man\nAnd bring him to the ground\nYou can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad\nAnd leave him when he's down, yeah\nBut I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you\nI'm standing on my own two feet\nOut of the doorway the bullets rip\nRepeating the sound of the beat\nOh yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnd another one gone, and another one gone\nAnother one bites the dust, yeah\nHey, I'm gonna get you, too\nAnother one bites the dust\n\n\n[Outro]\nShoot out\nAy-yeah\nAlright\n\n", "author": "Queen"}
