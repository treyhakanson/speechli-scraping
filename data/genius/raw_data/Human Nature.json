Oh, why?\n(That way) Why? Oh, why?\n\n[Verse 3]\nLooking out, across the morning\nThe city's heart begins to beat\nReaching out, I touch her shoulder\nI'm dreaming of the street\n\n[Chorus]\nIf they say why (why?), why (why?)\nTell them that it's human nature\nWhy (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?\nIf they say why (why?), why (why?)\n(She's keeping him by, keeping him around)\nOoh-ooh, tell 'em!\nWhy (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?\nIf they say why (why?), why (why?), why (why?)\nCha-da-cha-sha-sha-sha-sha-sha (aah-ah)\nWhy (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?\nIf they say why (why? why?), why (why? why? why?)\n(She's keeping him by, keeping him around)\nOoh-ooh, tell 'em!
