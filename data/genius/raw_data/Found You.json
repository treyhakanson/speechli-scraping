{"title": "Found You", "type": "lyrics", "content": "I be sitting in the same old bar\nHeart breaking on a broken bar stool\nWishing she'd come running back\nRunning from the past\nRunnin' up the tab, drinkin' for two\nBut that night my boys showed up\nDragged me out on the town\nHad to pick me up\nI'd never know what I was missin' if they didn't\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'd have never found you\nAt that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to\nThe way you move\nHad me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too\nSometimes the finish line is just the start of something new\nIf I'd have never lost her\nThen I'd have never found you\nNo, I'd have never found you\nNever found you\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, I still go out sometimes\nBut I don't ever try to get that drunk\nNow and I can't sleep it's 'cause you're all over me in the sheets\nAll night keeping me up\nYeah, it's hard to believe that a goodbye could be\nSo good to me\n\n[Chorus]\nNo, I'd have never found you\nAt that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to\nThe way you move\nHad me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too\nSometimes the finish line is just the start of something new\nIf I'd have never lost her\nThen I'd have never found you\nNo, I'd have never found you\nNo, I'd have never found you\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd now I'm takin' back the way I said I wish I've never met\nSometimes the things that don't work out\nCouldn't work out any better\nI'd have never found you\nNo, I'd have never found you\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'd have never found you\nAt that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to\nThe way you move\nHad me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too\nSometimes the finish line is just the start of something new\nIf I'd have never lost her\nThen I'd have never found you\nNo, I'd have never found you\nNever found, never found you\nNo, I'd have never found you\n\n", "author": "Kane Brown"}
