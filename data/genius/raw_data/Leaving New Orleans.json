{"title": "Leaving New Orleans", "type": "lyrics", "content": "I miss the Quarter\nThe magnolias and the Pontchartrain\nFrench market on a Saturday\nI'll miss the feel of this place\nI miss the Bayou sunrise\nThe Mardi Gras and the Saga Lines\nBourbon, jazz, sidewalk kids\nWith bottle cap taps, dancing for tips\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I'm leaving New Orleans\nThere's too much of you in this town\nYour memory is like moss in the trees\nEvery corner it's just hanging around\nWell, The Big Easy ain't so easy\nHard to say it but baby come morning\nI'll be rolling like the Mississippi leaving New Orleans\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell I like highways\nSo maybe LA is the place for me\nIf I point these wheels toward the Hollywood sign\nAll those miles to clear my mind\nOr I could watch a horse race on some bluegrass\nWhere bourbon's made\nCatch some rays in the Sunshine State\nHit Seattle if I need a little rain\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I'm leaving New Orleans\nThere's too much of you in this town\nYour memory's like moss in the trees\nEvery corner it's just hanging around\nWell, The Big Easy ain't so easy\nHard to say it but baby come morning\nI'll be rolling like the Mississippi leaving New Orleans\n\n[Bridge]\nI guess our good times have rolled away\nWell laissez les bons temps rouler\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm leaving New Orleans\nThere's too much of you in this town\nYour memory is like moss in the trees\nEvery corner it's just hanging around\nWell, The Big Easy ain't so easy\nHard to say it but baby come morning\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, I'm Leaving New Orleans\nThere's too much of you in this town\nYour memory is like moss in the trees\nEvery quarter is just hanging around\nWell, The Big Easy ain't so easy\nHard to say it but baby come morning\nI'll be rolling like the Mississippi leaving New Orleans\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, I'm leaving New Orleans\nGoodbye New Orleans\nLeaving New Orleans\n\n", "author": "Jordan Davis"}
