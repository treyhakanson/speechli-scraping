{"title": "Keep It Mello", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Woke up and just felt right\nPhone blown like a tailpipe\nToday's schedule airtight\nI turn a short day into a long night\nSee you soon if you got the heart\nMeet you outside Rennie park\nHurry up if it's gettin' dark\nWe don't say much and that says a lot\nHopped into that old Benz\nDrive through where that road ends\nGood times with some old friends\nI got just the thing if you so tense\nBurn one, let's go do some\nShe got me stoned as Medusa\nZoned out with a blank stare\nI'm lookin' into the future\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHold up, ain't nothing gonna hold us\nPut the devil to the side\nGot an angel on my shoulder\nAnd I'm like hello\nIt's good to finally let go\nI ain't worried 'bout a thing\nI just like to keep it mellow\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah I like to keep it mello\nI smoke to keep it mello\nI drink to keep it mello\nEvery day I keep it mello\nEvery day I keep it mello\nI smoke to keep it mello\nI drink to keep it mello\nEvery day I keep it mello\nEvery day I keep it mello\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's like 4 am and I'm bored again\nWhen that 40 end\nWhen that dream team all played out and they hit the bench\nI just step back, lemme soak it in\nI've seen the ups and downs so I get it now, I was born to win\nIt's my time, 'bout time, my turn, I can't lie\nWaiting for that one spark\nMy one hope to catch fire\nI'm fine, I'm high\nLight rain through that sunshine\nTryin' to man this old boat\nI'm the captain now and it's crunch time\nI don't care if I'm gettin' paid\nNeed the week but I get the day\nWide awake when I need sleep\nI'm knee deep but I set the way\nFocused on that one mistake, let it free don't let it break\nFuck it all, I'm turning in\nMy celly's off, the great escape\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHold up, ain't nothing gonna hold us\nPut the devil to the side\nGot an angel on my shoulder\nAnd I'm like hello\nIt's good to finally let go\nI ain't worried 'bout a thing\nI just like to keep it mellow\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah I like to keep it mello\nI smoke to keep it mello\nI drink to keep it mello\nEvery day I keep it mello\nEvery day I keep it mello\nI smoke to keep it mello\nI drink to keep it mello\nEvery day I keep it mello\nEvery day I keep it mello\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah I like to keep it mello\nI smoke to keep it mello\nI drink to keep it mello\nEvery day I keep it mello\nEvery day I keep it mello\nI smoke to keep it mello\nI drink to keep it mello\nEvery day I keep it mello\nEvery day I keep it mello\n\n[Outro]\nI smoke to keep it mello\nI drink to keep it mello\nEvery day I keep it mello\nEvery day I keep it mello\n\n", "author": "Marshmello"}
