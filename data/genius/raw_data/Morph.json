{"title": "Morph", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Move!\n\n[Verse 1]\nCan't stop thinking about if and when I die\nFor now I see that \"if\" and \"when\" are truly different cries\nFor \"if\" is purely panic and \"when\" is solemn sorrow\nAnd one invades today while the other spies tomorrow\nWe're surrounded and we're hounded\nThere's no above, or under, or around it\nFor \"above\" is blind belief and \"under\" is sword to sleeve\nAnd \"around\" is scientific miracle, let's pick \"above\" and see\nFor if and when we go above, the question still remains\nAre we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?\nAnd that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder\nBut until that time, I'll try to sing this\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I keep moving, they won't know\nI'll morph to someone else\nWhat they throw at me's too slow\nI'll morph to someone else\nI'm just a ghost\nI'll morph to someone else\nA defense mechanism mode\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki\nHe's got no friends close but those who know him most know\nHe goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy\nWhen I'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me\nWell, we're surrounded and we're hounded\nThere's no above or a secret door\nWhat are we here for\nIf not to run straight through all our tormentors?\nBut until that time, I'll try to sing this\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I keep moving, they won't know\nI'll morph to someone else\nWhat they throw at me's too slow\nI'll morph to someone else\nI'm just a ghost\nI'll morph to someone else\nA defense mechanism mode\nI'll morph to someone else\n\n[Bridge]\nLights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me\nOnes and zeroes, ergo this symphony\nAnybody listening? Ones and zeroes\nCount to infinity, ones and zeroes\nI'm surrounded and I'm hounded\nThere's no above, or under, or around it\nFor \"above\" is blind belief and \"under\" is sword to sleeve\nAnd \"around\" is scientific miracle, let's pick \"above\" and see\nFor if and when we go above, the question still remains\nAre we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?\nAnd that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder\nBut until that time\nI'll morph to someone else\nI'm just a ghost\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I keep moving, they won't know\nI'll morph to someone else\nWhat they throw at me's too slow\nI'll morph to someone else\nI'm just a ghost\nI'll morph to someone else\nA defense mechanism mode\nIf I keep moving, they won't know\nI'll morph to someone else\nA defense mechanism mode\nI'll morph to someone else\n\n[Outro]\nNot done, not done\nNot done, Josh Dun\nI'll morph to someone else\n\n", "author": "\u200btwenty one pilots"}
