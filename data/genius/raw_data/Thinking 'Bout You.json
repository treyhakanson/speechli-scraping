{"title": "Thinking 'Bout You", "type": "lyrics", "content": "3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me\nMusic blasting, shaking these walls\nThis time Mary Jane won't save me\nI've been working later, I've been drinking stronger\nI've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't stop thinking 'bout you\nI can't stop thinking 'bout you\nI can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through\nI can't stop thinking 'bout you\n\n[Verse 2]\nLike poison coursing through me\nSo clear my vision is blurred\nThe haze won't put my mind at ease\nI've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger\nI've been digging deeper, but the memories won't stop\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't stop thinking 'bout you\nI can't stop thinking 'bout you\nI can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through\nI can't stop thinking 'bout you\n\n[Bridge]\nI want you all\nSay it before you run out of time\nI want you all\nSay it before it's too late\nI want you all\nSay what I am feeling now\nI want you all\nWaiting is insane\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't stop thinking 'bout you\nI can't stop thinking 'bout you\nI can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through\nI can't stop thinking 'bout you\nI can't stop thinking 'bout you\nI can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through\nI can't stop thinking 'bout you\n\n", "author": "Dua Lipa"}
