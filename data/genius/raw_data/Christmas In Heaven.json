{"title": "Christmas In Heaven", "type": "lyrics", "content": "December hasn't changed\nThis town looks the same\nThey still light that tree in the city square\nThere's red, white, and green shining everywhere\nAnd I wish you were here\nAnd I wonder\n\n[Chorus]\nIs the snow falling down on the streets of gold\nAre the mansions all covered in white\nAre you singing with angels \"Silent Night\"\nI wonder what Christmas in heaven is like\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere's a little manger  scene\nDown on Third and Main\nI must have walked right by it a thousand times\nBut I see it now in a different light\n'Cause I know you are there\nAnd I wonder\nAre you kneeling with shepherds before him now\nCan you reach out and touch his face\nAre you part of that glorious Holy night\nI wonder what Christmas in Heaven is like\n\n[Chorus]\n\n", "author": "Scotty McCreery"}
