{"title": "Rearview Town", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Wiped the footprints off my dash\nTore up those sun-faded photographs\nThrew 'em in the wind, ya'll can have it back\nI'm outta here\nI stuck my middle finger up in the sky\nFlipped off that \"ya'll come back\" sign\nLooked in the mirror one last time\nAnd watched it disappear\n\n[Chorus]\nIt ain't nothin' but a rearview town\nBroken hearts and rusted plows\nRoots ripped right up out of the ground\nNever thought I'd ever leave it\nIt ain't nothin' what it used to be\nPopulation minus me\nOn the other side of that dust cloud\nAin't nothin' but a rearview town\n\n[Verse 2]\nI could tough it out, but what's the use?\nA place that small, it's hard to do\nToo much of her to run into\nAnd so much road to somewhere new\n\n[Chorus]\nIt ain't nothin' but a rearview town\nBroken hearts and rusted plows\nRoots ripped right up out of the ground\nNever thought I'd ever leave it\nIt ain't nothin' what it used to be\nPopulation minus me\nOn the other side of that dust cloud\nAin't nothin' but a rearview town\n\n[Bridge]\nIt ain't nothin' but yesterday\nOne less truck rollin' down Main\nAin't nothin' left to say\n\n[Chorus]\nIt ain't nothin' what it used to be\nPopulation minus me\nOn the other side of that dust cloud\nAin't nothin' but a rearview town\nAin't nothin' but a rearview town\n\n", "author": "Jason Aldean"}
