{"title": "Oblivion", "type": "lyrics", "content": "When you fall asleep\nWith your head upon my shoulder\nWhen you're in my arms\nBut you've gone somewhere deeper\n\n[Bridge]\nAre you going to age with grace?\nAre you going to age without mistakes?\nAre you going to age with grace?\nOr only to wake and hide your face?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen oblivion\nIs calling out your name\nYou always take it further\nThan I ever can\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you play it hard\nAnd I try to follow you there\nIt's not about control\nBut I turn back when I see where you go\n\n[Bridge]\nAre you going to age with grace?\nAre you going to leave a path to trace?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen oblivion\nIs calling out your name\nYou always take it further\nThan I ever can\nWhen oblivion\nIs calling out your name\nYou always take it further\nThan I ever can\n\n", "author": "Bastille"}
