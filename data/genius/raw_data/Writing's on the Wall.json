{"title": "Writing's on the Wall", "type": "lyrics", "content": "I've been here before\nBut always hit the floor\nI've spent a lifetime runnin'\nAnd I always get away\nBut with you I'm feeling something\nThat makes me want to stay\nI'm prepared for this\nI never shoot to miss\nBut I feel like a storm is coming\nIf I'm gonna make it through the day\nThen there's no more use in runnin'\nThis is something I gotta face\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf I risk it all\nCould you break my fall?\n\n[Chorus]\nHow do I live? How do I breathe?\nWhen you're not here I'm suffocating\nI wanna feel love run through my blood\nTell me is this where I give it all up?\nFor you I have to risk it all\nCause the writing's on the wall\n\n[Verse 2]\nA million shards of glass\nThat haunt me from my past\nAs the stars begin to gather\nAnd the light begins to fade\nWhen all hope begins to shatter\nKnow that I won't be afraid\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf I risk it all\nCould you break my fall?\n\n[Chorus]\nHow do I live? How do I breathe?\nWhen you're not here I'm suffocating\nI wanna feel love, run through my blood\nTell me is this where I give it all up?\nFor you I have to risk it all\nCause the writing's on the wall\n\n[Bridge]\nThe writing's on the wall\n\n[Chorus]\nHow do I live? How do I breathe?\nWhen you're not here I'm suffocating\nI wanna feel love, run through my blood\nTell me is this where I give it all up?\nHow do I live? How do I breathe?\nWhen you're not here I'm suffocating\nI wanna feel love run through my blood\nTell me is this where I give it all up?\nFor you I have to risk it all\nCause the writing's on the wall\n\n", "author": "Sam Smith"}
