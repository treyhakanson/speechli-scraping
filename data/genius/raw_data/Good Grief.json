Oh\n\n[Chorus]\nEvery minute and every hour\nI miss you, I miss you, I miss you more\nEvery stumble and each misfire\nI miss you, I miss you, I miss you more\n\n[Refrain]\nWatching through my fingers\nWatching through my fingers\n\n[Verse 3]\nCaught off guard by your favourite song\nOh I\u2019ll be dancing at a funeral\nDancing at a funeral\nSleeping in the clothes you love\nIt\u2019s such a shame we had to see them burn\nShame we had to see them burn\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat\u2019s gonna be left of the world if you\u2019re not in it?\nWhat\u2019s gonna be left of the world, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nEvery minute and every hour\nI miss you, I miss you, I miss you more\nEvery stumble and each misfire\nI miss you, I miss you, I miss you more\n\n[Interlude]\nIf you want to be a party animal, you have to learn to live in the jungle\nNow stop worrying and go get dressed\n\n[Bridge]\nYou might have to excuse me\nI\u2019ve lost control of all my senses\nAnd you might have to excuse me\nI\u2019ve lost control of all my words\nSo get drunk, call me a fool\nPut me in my place, put me in my place\nPick me up, up off the floor\nPut me in my place, put me in my place\n\n[Chorus]\nEvery minute and every hour\nI miss you, I miss you, I miss you more\nEvery stumble and each misfire\nI miss you, I miss you, I miss you more\n\n[Refrain]\nWatching through my fingers\nWatching through my fingers\n\n[Outro]\nCause every minute and every hour\nI miss you, I miss you, I miss you more\n\n", "author": "Bastille"}
