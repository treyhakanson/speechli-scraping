{"title": "Stay With Me", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand\nBut I still need love cause I'm just a man\nThese nights never seem to go to plan\nI don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?\n\n[Chorus]\nOh won't you stay with me?\n'Cause you're all I need\nThis ain't love, it's clear to see\nBut darling, stay with me\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhy am I so emotional?\nNo it's not a good look, gain some self control\nAnd deep down I know this never works\nBut you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt\n\n[Chorus]\nOh won't you stay with me?\n'Cause you're all I need\nThis ain't love, it's clear to see\nBut darling, stay with me\n\n[Chorus]\nOh won't you stay with me?\n'Cause you're all I need\nThis ain't love, it's clear to see\nBut darling, stay with me\n\n[Chorus]\nOh won't you stay with me?\n'Cause you're all I need\nThis ain't love, it's clear to see\nBut darling, stay with me\n\n", "author": "Sam Smith"}
