{"title": "Only Jesus", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Make it count, leave a mark, build a name for yourself\nDream your dreams, chase your heart, above all else\nMake a name the world remembers\nBut all an empty world can sell is empty dreams\nI got lost in the lie that it was up to me\nTo make a name the world remembers\nBut Jesus is the only name to remember\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I-I-I, I don't want to leave a legacy\nI don't care if they remember me\nOnly Jesus\nAnd I-I-I, I've only got one life to live\nI'll let every second point to Him\nOnly Jesus\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll the kingdoms built, all the trophies won\nWill crumble into dust when it's said and done\n'Cause all that really matters\nDid I live the truth to the ones I love?\nWas my life the proof that there is only One\nWhose name will last forever?\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I-I-I, I don't want to leave a legacy\nI don't care if they remember me\nOnly Jesus\nAnd I-I-I, I've only got one life to live\nI'll let every second point to Him\nOnly Jesus\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Bridge]\nJesus is the only name, Jesus is the only name\nJesus is the only name to remember, ooh\nJesus is the only name, Jesus is the only name\nJesus is the only name to remember\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I-I-I, I don't want to leave a legacy\nI don't care if they remember me\nOnly Jesus\nAnd I-I-I, I've only got one life to live\nI'll let every second point to Him\nOnly Jesus\n\n[Outro]\nI, I don't want to leave a legacy\nI don't care if they remember me\nOnly Jesus\n\n", "author": "Casting Crowns"}
