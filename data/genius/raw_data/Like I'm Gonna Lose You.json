{"title": "Like I'm Gonna Lose You", "type": "lyrics", "content": "I found myself dreaming in silver and gold\nLike a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows\nWe were walking on moonlight, and you pulled me close\nSplit second and you disappeared and then I was all alone\nI woke up in tears, with you by my side\nA breath of relief, and I realized\nNo, we're not promised tomorrow\n\n[Hook: Meghan Trainor]\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\nI'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye\nWherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted\nCause we'll never know when\nWhen we'll run out of time\nSo I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you\nI'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you\n\n[Verse 2: John Legend]\nIn the blink of an eye, just a whisper of smoke\nYou could lose everything, the truth is you never know\nSo I'll kiss you longer babe (hey) any chance that I get\nI'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret\nSo let's take our time to say what we want\nUse what we got before it's all gone\nNo, we're not promised tomorrow\n\n[Chorus: Meghan Trainor and John Legend]\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\nI'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye\nWherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted\nCause we'll never know when\nWhen we'll run out of time\nSo I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you\nI'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you\n\n[Bridge: Meghan Trainor and John Legend]\nSo I'm gonna love you\nLike I'm gonna lose you\nI'm gonna love you\nLike I'm gonna lose you\n\n[Chorus: Meghan Trainor and John Legend]\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\nI'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye\nWherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted\nCause we'll never know when\nWhen we'll run out of time\nSo I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you\nI'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you\n\n[Outro: Meghan Trainor and John Legend]\nSo I'm gonna love you\nLike I'm gonna lose you\nI'm gonna love you\nLike I'm gonna lose you\n\n", "author": "Meghan Trainor"}
