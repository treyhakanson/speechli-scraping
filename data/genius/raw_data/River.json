{"title": "River", "type": "lyrics", "content": "I've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nTruth and my lies right now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nHe's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack\nSweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched\nOn his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict\nAnd she just wants to exact revenge and get back\nIt's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack\nShe's kept track of all his Internet chats\nAnd guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next\nActually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks\n'Cause she loves danger, psychopath\nAnd you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that\nBut she's devised some plan to stab him in the back\nKnife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand\nSo she's been on the web lately\nSays maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man\nAnd I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care\nHi Suzanne, but I shoulda said \"Bye Suzanne\"\nAfter the first night, but tonight I am\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nA one-night stand turned a two-night stand\nIt was \"come sunlight, scram,\" now we hug tight, and...\nHe found out, now she feels deserted and used\n'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)\nRiver (ooh), river run\nCall me (ooh), call me (ooh)\nRiver (ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (I'm sorry)\nI don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n", "author": "Eminem"}
