{"title": "HOLY", "type": "lyrics", "content": "When the sun had left and the winter came\nAnd the sky fall to only bring the rain\nI sat in darkness\nAll broken-hearted\nI couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone\nI never meant to cry, started losin' hope\nBut somehow, baby\nYou broke through and saved me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou're an angel, tell me you're never leavin'\n'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're holy, holy\nHoly, holy\nI'm high on lovin' you\nHigh on lovin' you\nYou're holy, holy\nHoly, holy\nI'm high on lovin' you\nHigh on lovin' you\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou made the brightest days from the darkest nights\nYou're the river bank where I was baptized\nCleansed from the demons\nThat were killin' my freedom\nLet me lay you down, give me to ya\nGet you singin', babe, hallelujah\nWe'll be touchin'\nWe'll be touchin' heaven\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou're an angel, tell me you're never leavin'\n'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're holy, holy\nHoly, holy\nI'm high on lovin' you\nHigh on lovin' you\nYou're holy, holy\nHoly, holy\nI'm high on lovin' you\nHigh on lovin' you\n\n[Bridge]\nI don't need the stars 'cause you shine for me\nLike fire in my veins, you're my ecstasy\nYou're my ecstasy\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're holy, holy\nHoly, holy\nI'm high on lovin' you\nHigh on lovin' you\nYou're holy, holy\nHoly, holy\nI'm high on lovin' you\nHigh on lovin' you\n\n[Outro]\nYou're the healin' hands where it used to hurt\nYou're my savin' grace, you're my kind of church\nYou're holy\n\n", "author": "Florida Georgia Line"}
