{"title": "For Whom the Bell Tolls", "type": "lyrics", "content": "\n[Verse 1]\nMake his fight on the hill in the early day\nConstant chill deep inside\nShouting gun, on they run through the endless grey\nOn they fight, for they're right\nYes, but who's to say?\nFor a hill, men would kill\nWhy? They do not know\nStiffened wounds test their pride\nMen of five still alive through the raging glow\nGone insane from the pain that they surely know\n\n[Chorus]\nFor whom the bell tolls\nTime marches on\nFor whom the bell tolls\n\n[Verse 2]\nTake a look to the sky just before you die\nIt's the last time he will\nBlackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky\nShattered goal fill his soul with a ruthless cry\nStranger now are his eyes to this mystery\nHears the silence so loud\nCrack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be\nNow they see what will be, blinded eyes to see\n\n[Chorus]\nFor whom the bell tolls\nTime marches on\nFor whom the bell tolls\n\n[Outro]\n\n", "author": "Metallica"}
