{"title": "Ghost of You", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Here I am waking up, still can't sleep on your side\nThere's your coffee cup, the lipstick stain fades with time\nIf I can dream long enough, you'd tell me I'd be just fine\nI'll be just fine\n\n[Chorus: Luke]\nSo I drown it out like I always do\nDancing through our house with the ghost of you\nAnd I chase it down, with a shot of truth\nDancing through our house with the ghost of you\n\n[Verse 2: Calum]\nCleaning up today, found that old Zeppelin shirt\nYou wore when you ran away, and no one could feel your hurt\nWe're too young, too dumb, to know things like love\nBut I know better now, better now\n\n[Chorus: Luke & All]\nSo I drown it out like I always do\nDancing through our house with the ghost of you\nAnd I chase it down, with a shot of truth\nDancing through our house with the ghost of you\n\n[Bridge: Calum]\nToo young, too dumb\nTo know things like love\nToo young, too dumb\n\n[Chorus: Luke]\nSo I drown it out like I always do\nDancing through our house with the ghost of you\nAnd I'll chase it down, with a shot of truth\nThat my feet don't dance like they did with you\n\n", "author": "5 Seconds of Summer"}
