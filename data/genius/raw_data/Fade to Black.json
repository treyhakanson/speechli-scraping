{"title": "Fade to Black", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Life, it seems, will fade away\nDrifting further every day\nGetting lost within myself\nNothing matters, no one else\nI have lost the will to live\nSimply nothing more to give\nThere is nothing more for me\nNeed the end to set me free\n\n[Verse 2]\nThings not what they used to be\nMissing one inside of me\nDeathly loss, this can't be real\nCannot stand this hell I feel\nEmptiness is filling me\nTo the point of agony\nGrowing darkness taking dawn\nI was me, but now he's gone\n\n[Bridge]\nNo one but me can save myself, but it's too late\nNow I can't think... think why I should even try\nYesterday seems as though it never existed\nDeath greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye\nGoodbye...\n\n[Instrumental Outro]\n\n", "author": "Metallica"}
