{"title": "East To West", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Here I am, Lord\nAnd I'm drowning in your sea of forgetfulness\nThe chains of yesterday surround me\nI yearn for peace and rest\nI don't want to end up where you found me\nAnd it echoes in my mind\nKeeps me awake tonight\nI know you've cast my sin as far as\nThe east is from the west\nAnd I stand before you now as though I've never sinned\nBut today i feel like I'm just one mistake away\nFrom you leaving me this way\n\n[Chorus]\nJesus, can you show me\nJust how far the east is from the west\nCause i can't bear to see the man I've been\nCome rising up in me again\nIn the arms of your mercy I find rest\nCause you know just how far the east is from the west\nFrom one scarred hand to the other\n\n[Verse 2]\nI start the day, the war begins\nEndless reminding of my sin\nTime and time again\nYour truth is drowned out by the storm I'm in\nToday i feel like I'm just one mistake away\nFrom you leaving me this way\n\n[Chorus]\nJesus, can you show me\nJust how far the east is from the west\nCause i can't bear to see the man I've been\nCome rising up in me again\nIn the arms of your mercy I find rest\nCause you know just how far the east is from the west\nFrom one scarred hand to the other\n\n[Verse 3]\nI know you've washed me white\nTurned my darkness into light\nI need your peace to get me through\nTo get me through this night\nI can't live by what i feel\nBut by the truth your word reveals\nI'm not holding on to you\nBut you're holding on to me\nYou're holding on to me\n\n[Outro]\nJesus, you know just how far\nThe east is from the west\nI don't have to see the man I've been\nCome rising up in me again\nIn the arms of your mercy I find rest\nCause you know just how far\nThe east is from the west\nFrom one scarred hand to the other\nOne scarred hand to the other\nFrom one scarred hand to the other\n\n", "author": "Casting Crowns"}
