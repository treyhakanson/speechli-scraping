{"title": "The Sound of Silence", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Hello darkness, my old friend\nI've come to talk with you again\nBecause a vision softly creeping\nLeft its seeds while I was sleeping\nAnd the vision that was planted in my brain\nStill remains within the sound of silence\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn restless dreams I walked alone\nNarrow streets of cobblestone\n'Neath the halo of a street lamp\nI turned my collar to the cold and damp\nWhen my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light\nThat split the night and touched the sound of silence\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd in the naked light I saw\nTen thousand people, maybe more\nPeople talking without speaking\nPeople hearing without listening\nPeople writing songs that voices never shared\nAnd no one dared disturb the sound of silence\n\n[Verse 4]\n\"Fools\", said I, \"You do not know\nSilence like a cancer grows\nHear my words that I might teach you\nTake my arms that I might reach you\"\nBut my words like silent raindrops fell\nAnd echoed in the wells of silence\n\n[Verse 5]\nAnd the people bowed and prayed\nTo the neon God they made\nAnd the sign flashed out its warning\nIn the words that it was forming\nAnd the sign said \"The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls\nAnd tenement halls and whispered in the sound of silence\"\n\n", "author": "Disturbed"}
