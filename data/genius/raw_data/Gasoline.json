{"title": "Gasoline", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Are you insane like me? Been in pain like me?\nBought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me?\nJust to pour that motherfucker down the drain like me?\nWould you use your water bill to dry the stain like me?\nAre you high enough without the Mary Jane like me?\nDo you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?\nDo the people whisper \u2018bout you on the train like me?\nSaying that \"you shouldn't waste your pretty face\" like me?\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd all the people say\n\"You can't wake up, this is not a dream\nYou're part of a machine, you are not a human being\nWith your face all made up, living on a screen\nLow on self esteem, so you run on gasoline\"\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Oh, ooh oh, ooh oh, oh)\nI think there\u2019s a flaw in my code\n(Oh, ooh oh, ooh oh, oh)\nThese voices won\u2019t leave me alone\nWell my heart is gold and my hands are cold\n\n[Verse 2]\nAre you deranged like me? Are you strange like me?\nLighting matches just to swallow up the flame like me?\nDo you call yourself a fucking hurricane like me?\nPointing fingers cause you'll never take the blame like me?\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd all the people say\n\"You can't wake up, this is not a dream\nYou're part of a machine, you are not a human being\nWith your face all made up, living on a screen\nLow on self esteem, so you run on gasoline\"\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Oh, ooh oh, ooh oh, oh)\nI think there\u2019s a flaw in my code\n(Oh, ooh oh, ooh oh, oh)\nThese voices won\u2019t leave me alone\nWell my heart is gold and my hands are cold\n\n", "author": "Halsey"}
