{"title": "Easy Love", "type": "lyrics", "content": "You got a way of makin' me feel insane\nLike I can't trust my own brain\nUnless it's screaming your name\nI'd have it no other way\nI'd have it no other way\nAnd maybe that's why I stay\nHow many times can we pick up the same fight?\nCan we keep screaming all night\nAnd make up until it's light?\nThat's when I say that you're right\nAnd feel your body on mine\nOh maybe that's why I stay\n\n[Chorus]\nI could be somewhere chillin' on the beach\nI could be with someone makin' me happy\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love\nI could put my phone down, just pick up my keys\nI could let you go, and we could let it be\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love\n\n[Verse 2]\nKeep comin' back, guess you could say I'm attached\nLast time we called it a wrap, I came beggin' and all that\nYou're like a habit, it's bad\nI got a habit, it's bad\nOh no, I'm not even mad\n\n[Chorus]\nI could be somewhere chillin' on the beach\nI could be with someone makin' me happy\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love\nI could put my phone down, just pick up my keys\nI could let you go, and we could let it be\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's the way you keep me up all night\nIt's the way you make me lose my mind\nEvery time I'm sayin' one more night\nIt's the way you know I'm yours\nIt's the way you know I'm yours for life\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I could be somewhere chillin' on the beach\nI could be with someone makin' me happy\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love\nI could put my phone down, just pick up my keys\nI could let you go, and we could let it be\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love\n\n", "author": "Lauv"}
