My - my step brother used to flip them bags\nOutside the crib like it was trash day\nNo Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)\nBut when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash\nWith all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas\nLook, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it\nTell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it\nSuccess is on the way, I feel it in the distance\nUsed to look up at the stars\nAnd be like, \"Ain't too much that's different\"\nI be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot, don't you miss it\nWhat you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission?\n\n[Hook: Kanye West]\nAnd I hope you learn to make it on your own\nAnd if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone\nI hope that you get everything you want and that you chose\nI hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know\nHope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything\nMillion dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams\nAnd when you get it all, just remember one thing\nRemember one thing, one man could change the world\nOne man could change the world\n\n[Verse 2: Big Sean]\nMy grandma told me, \"If you write your name in stone\nYou'll never get the white out\"\nI grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House\nStandin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories, then laughed\nI said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks\nWhere I'm from, I swear they broke\nThey need way more than the cast\nWe need more than what you have\nAnd then we need more than that\nBut how am I supposed to say I'm tired\nIf that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions\nThat I couldn't survive?\nWent to war, came back alive\nOn top of that became a female black captain\nWhen being black, you had to extra-extra try\nWay before James Brown made us proud\nShe bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye\nRight there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive\nAnd she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right\nTaught me how to love, taught me not to cry\nWhen I die, I hope you teach me how to fly\nAll my life you've been that angel in disguise, sayin'...\n\n[Hook: John Legend]\nI hope you learn to make it on your own\nAnd if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone\nI hope that you get everything you want and that you chose\nI hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know\nHope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything\nMillion dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams\nAnd when you get it all, just remember one thing\nRemember one thing, that one man can change the world\nThat one man can change the world\n\n[Outro: Grandma & Big Sean]\nThank you for callin' me, been thinkin' about you\nIt's all good, I love you grandma\nBye\n\n", "author": "Big Sean"}
