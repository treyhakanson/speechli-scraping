Master!\nMaster of Puppets, I'm pulling your strings\nTwisting your mind and smashing your dreams\nBlinded by me, you can't see a thing\nJust call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream\nMaster! Master!\nJust call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream\nMaster! Master!\n\n[Verse 2]\nNeedlework the way, never you betray\nLife of death becoming clearer\nPain monopoly, ritual misery\nChop your breakfast on a mirror\n\n[Refrain]\nTaste me, you will see, more is all you need\nDedicated to how I'm killing you\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCome crawling faster (faster)\nObey your master (master)\nYour life burns faster (faster)\nObey your...\n\n[Chorus]\nMaster!
