(G)\nGot my middle, middle up while I'm singing (Uh)\n\n[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & (G-Eazy)]\nFuck fake friends\nWe don't need 'em\nOnly thing they're good for is leaving\nFuck fake friends\nWe don't need 'em\nI've had it up to the ceiling\nFuck fake friends\nWe don't need 'em\nOnly thing they're good for is leaving\nAnd I ain't got the time, money on my mind\nI'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends\n(Yeah) We don't need 'em\n(Bebe, you know I feel you)\n\n[Bridge: Bebe Rexha]\nAnd I ain't got the time, money on my mind\nSay it to my face, don't pretend\nAnd I ain't got the time, money on my mind\nI'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends\nAnd I ain't got the time, money on my mind\nSay it to my face, don't pretend\nAnd I ain't got the time, money on my mind\nI'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]\nIs there anybody real out here?\nGot my middle, middle up while I'm singing\n\n[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]\nFuck fake friends\nWe don't need 'em\nOnly thing they're good for is leaving\nFuck fake friends\nWe don't need 'em\nI've had it up to the ceiling\nFuck fake friends\nWe don't need 'em\nOnly thing they're good for is leaving\nAnd I ain't got the time, money on my mind\nI'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends\n\n", "author": "Bebe Rexha"}
