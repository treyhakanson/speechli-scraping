{"title": "Someone Like You", "type": "lyrics", "content": "I heard that you're settled down\nThat you found a girl and you're married now\nI heard that your dreams came true\nGuess she gave you things I didn't give to you\nOld friend, why are you so shy?\nAin't like you to hold back or hide from the light\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited\nBut I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it\nI had hoped you'd see my face\nAnd that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over\n\n[Chorus]\nNever mind, I'll find someone like you\nI wish nothing but the best for you, too\n\"Don't forget me,\" I beg\n\"I'll remember,\" you said\nSometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead\nSometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou know how the time flies\nOnly yesterday was the time of our lives\nWe were born and raised in a summer haze\nBound by the surprise of our glory days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited\nBut I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it\nI had hoped you'd see my face\nAnd that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over\n\n[Chorus]\nNever mind, I'll find someone like you\nI wish nothing but the best for you, too\n\"Don't forget me,\" I beg\n\"I'll remember,\" you said\nSometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead\n\n[Bridge]\nNothing compares, no worries or cares\nRegrets and mistakes, they're memories made\nWho would have known how bittersweet this would taste?\n\n[Breakdown]\nNever mind, I'll find someone like you\nI wish nothing but the best for you\n\"Don't forget me,\" I beg\n\"I'll remember,\" you said\nSometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead\n\n[Chorus]\nNever mind, I'll find someone like you\nI wish nothing but the best for you, too\n\"Don't forget me,\" I beg\n\"I'll remember,\" you said\nSometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead\nSometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead\n\n", "author": "Adele"}
