Are you okay, Annie?\nAnnie, are you okay?\nSo, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?\nAnnie, are you okay?\nSo, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?\nAnnie, are you okay?\nSo, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?\n\n[Chorus]\nAnnie, are you okay?\nWill you tell us that you're okay?\nThere's a sound at the window\nThen he struck you \u2014 a crescendo, Annie\nHe came into your apartment\nLeft the bloodstains on the carpet\nAnd then you ran into the bedroom\nYou were struck down\nIt was your doom\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nAnnie, are you okay?\nSo, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?\nAnnie, are you okay?\nSo, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?\nAnnie, are you okay?\nSo, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?\n\n[Refrain]\nYou've been hit by\u2014\nYou've been hit by\u2014\nA Smooth Criminal\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo they came in to the outway\nIt was Sunday, what a black day\nEvery time I tried to find him\nThere were no clues, they\u2019re behind him\nAnd they end up never knowing\nWho\u2019s the suspect or what to expect\nMouth-to-mouth resuscitation\nSounding heartbeats, intimidation\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnnie, are you okay?\nSo, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?\nAnnie, are you okay?\nSo, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?\nAnnie, are you okay?\nAnnie, are you okay? Are you okay?\nAnnie, are you okay?\nSo, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?\nAnnie, are you okay?\nSo, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?\n\n[Chorus]\nAnnie, are you okay?\nWill you tell us that you're okay?\nThere's a sound at the window\nThen he struck you \u2014 a crescendo, Annie\nHe came into your apartment\nLeft the bloodstains on the carpet\nAnd then you ran into the bedroom\nYou were struck down\nIt was your doom\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nAnnie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?\nAre you okay, Annie?\n\n[Refrain]\nYou've been hit by\u2014\nYou've been struck by\u2014\nA Smooth Criminal\n\n[Outro]\nAnnie are you okay? (I don't know)\nWill you tell us that you're okay? (I don't know)\nThere's a sound at the window (I don't know)\nThen he struck you, a crescendo Annie? (I don't know)\nHe came into your apartment (I don't know)\nLeft bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why baby)\nAnd then you ran into the bedroom (help me)\nYou were struck down\nIt was your doom Annie (dag gone it)\nAnnie are you okay? (dag gone it-baby)\nWill you tell us that you're okay? (dag gone it-baby)\nThere's a sound at the window (dag gone it-baby)\nThen he struck you, a crescendo Annie\nHe came into your apartment, (dag gone it)\nLeft bloodstains on the carpet\nAnd then you ran into the bedroom\nYou were struck down (dag gone it)\nIt was your doom Annie\n\n", "author": "Michael Jackson"}
