{"title": "Coaster", "type": "lyrics", "content": "As time passes, I feel so low\nSearchin' for pieces, covering up the hole\nI'll fight for your love, I'll fight for your soul\nI'll throw all of my cares away for you\nI'll be there to wait for you\nMaybe you weren't the one for me\nBut deep down I wanted you to be\nI'll still see you in my dreams\nAll the things that I did for you, just wasn't it for you\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I'll be coasting, roller-coasting\nThrough my emotion\nI will be coasting, roller-coasting\nI'm hoping that you'll come back to me\n\n[Verse 2]\nMoving on seems harder to do\nWhen the one that you love moves faster than you\nI gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies\nAnd you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me\nAs time passes I'm feeling high\nYou're not the one I'm thinking of tonight\nI may not be over you, but I'll try inside\nI'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nCoasting, roller-coasting\nIn my emotions, oh\nI'll be coasting, roller-coasting\nI noticed you weren't the one for me\n\n[Outro]\nYou weren't the one for me\nYou weren't the one for me\nYou weren't the one for me\nYou weren't the one for me\nWeren't the one for me\nYou weren't the one\nYou weren't the one for me\nSo don't come back to me, no\nNo, don't come back to me, no\nNo, don't come back to me\nNo, don't come back to me, no\nNo, don't come back to me\nYou weren't the one for me\nYou weren't the one for me\nYou weren't the one for me\nYou weren't the one for me\n\n", "author": "Khalid"}
