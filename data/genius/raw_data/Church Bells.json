{"title": "Church Bells", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy\nOut in the shack with a blue tick hound\nBroke as hell, but blessed with beauty\nThe kind that a rich man can't turn down\nShe caught the eye of an oil man dancing\nOne summer night in a dime store dress\nShe had the looks, he had the mansion\nAnd you can figure out the rest\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt was all roses, dripping in diamonds\nSipping on champagne\nShe was all uptown, wearing that white gown\nTaking his last name\n\n[Chorus]\nShe could hear those church bells ringing, ringing\nAnd up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing\nFold your hands and close your eyes\nYeah, it's all gonna be alright\nAnd just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing\nYeah, they're ringing\n\n[Verse 2]\nJenny was hosting Junior League parties\nAnd having dinner at the country club\nEveryone thought they were Ken and Barbie\nBut Ken was always getting way too drunk\nSaturday night, after a few too many\nHe came home ready to fight\nAnd all his money could never save Jenny\nFrom the devil living in his eyes\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt was all bruises, covered in makeup\nDark sunglasses\nAnd that next morning, sitting in the back pew\nPraying with the baptist\n\n[Chorus]\nShe could hear those church bells ringing, ringing\nAnd up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing\nFold your hands and close your eyes\nYeah, it's all gonna be alright\nYou just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing\nYeah, they're ringing\n\n[Verse 3]\nJenny slipped something in his Tennessee whiskey\nNo law man was ever gonna find\nAnd how he died is still a mystery\nBut he hit a woman for the very last time\n\n[Chorus]\nShe could hear those church bells ringing, ringing\nStanding there in a black dress singing, singing\nFold your hands and close your eyes\nYeah, it's all gonna be alright\nAnd just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing\nYeah, they're ringing\n\n", "author": "Carrie Underwood"}
