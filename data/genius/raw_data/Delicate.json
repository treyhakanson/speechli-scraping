Isn't it? Isn't it?\nIsn't it?\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\nIsn't it... delicate?\n\n[Verse 2]\nThird floor on the West Side, me and you\nHandsome, you're a mansion with a view\nDo the girls back home touch you like I do?\nLong night, with your hands up in my hair\nEchoes of your footsteps on the stairs\nStay here, honey, I don't wanna share\n'Cause I like you\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThis ain't for the best\nMy reputation's never been worse, so\nYou must like me for me\u2026\nYeah, I want you...\nWe can't make\nAny promises now, can we, babe?\nBut you can make me a drink\n\n[Chorus]\nIs it cool that I said all that?\nIs it chill that you're in my head?\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)\nIs it cool that I said all that?\nIs it too soon to do this yet?\n'Cause I know that it's delicate\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\nIsn't it?\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\nIsn't it delicate?\n\n[Bridge]\nSometimes I wonder when you sleep\nAre you ever dreaming of me?\nSometimes when I look into your eyes\nI pretend you're mine, all the damn time\n'Cause I like you\n\n[Chorus]\nIs it cool that I said all that?\nIs it chill that you're in my head?\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)\n(Yeah, I want you)\nIs it cool that I said all that?\nIs it too soon to do this yet?\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)\n'Cause I like you\nIs it cool that I said all that?\nIsn't it?
