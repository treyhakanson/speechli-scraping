{"title": "Demons", "type": "lyrics", "content": "When the days are cold and the cards all fold\nAnd the saints we see are all made of gold\nWhen your dreams all fail and the ones we hail\nAre the worst of all, and the blood's run stale\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you\nBut with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide\nNo matter what we breed, we still are made of greed\nThis is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you feel my heat, look into my eyes\nIt's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide\nDon't get too close; it's dark inside\nIt's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide\n\n[Verse 2]\nAt the curtain's call it's the last of all\nWhen the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl\nSo they dug your grave and the masquerade\nWill come calling out at the mess you made\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound\nThough this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth\nNo matter what we breed, we still are made of greed\nThis is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you feel my heat, look into my eyes\nIt's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide\nDon't get too close; it's dark inside\nIt's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide\n\n[Bridge]\nThey say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate\nIt's woven in my soul, I need to let you go\nYour eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light\nI can't escape this now, unless you show me how\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you feel my heat, look into my eyes\nIt's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide\nDon't get too close; it's dark inside\nIt's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide\n\n", "author": "Imagine Dragons"}
