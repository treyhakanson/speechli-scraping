{"title": "Voice Of Truth", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Oh what I would do to have\nThe kind of faith it takes to climb out of this boat I'm in\nOnto the crashing waves\nTo step out of my comfort zone\nTo the realm of the unknown where Jesus is\nAnd He's holding out his hand\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut the waves are calling out my name and they laugh at me\nReminding me of all the times I've tried before and failed\nThe waves they keep on telling me\nTime and time again\n\"Boy, you'll never win!\nYou'll never win\"\n\n[Chorus:]\nBut the voice of truth tells me a different story\nAnd the voice of truth says \"Do not be afraid!\"\nAnd the voice of truth says \"This is for My glory\"\nOut of all the voices calling out to me\nI will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth\n\n[Verse 2:]\nOh what I would do to have\nThe kind of strength it takes to stand before a giant\nWith just a sling and a stone\nSurrounded by the sound of a thousand warriors\nShaking in their armor\nWishing they'd have had the strength to stand\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut the giants are calling out my name and they laugh at me\nReminding me of all the times I've tried before and failed\nThe waves they keep on telling me\nTime and time again\n\"Boy, you'll never win!\nYou'll never win\"\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bridge]\nBut the stone was just the right size\nTo put the giant on the ground\nAnd the waves they don't seem so high\nFrom on top of them looking down\nI will soar with the wings of eagles\nWhen I stop and listen to the sound of Jesus\nSinging over me\n\n[Outro]\nI will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth\n\n", "author": "Casting Crowns"}
