{"title": "In My Life", "type": "lyrics", "content": "There are places I'll remember\nAll my life though some have changed\nSome forever not for better\nSome have gone and some remain\nAll these places had their moments\nWith lovers and friends I still can recall\nSome are dead and some are living\nIn my life I've loved them all\n\n[Verse 2]\nBut of all these friends and lovers\nThere is no one compares with you\nAnd these memories lose their meaning\nWhen I think of love as something new\nThough I know I'll never lose affection\nFor people and things that went before\nI know I'll often stop and think about them\nIn my life I love you more\n\n[Piano Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThough I know I'll never lose affection\nFor people and things that went before\nI know I'll often stop and think about them\nIn my life I love you more\n\n[Outro]\nIn my life I love you more\n\n", "author": "The Beatles"}
