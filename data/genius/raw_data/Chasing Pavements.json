{"title": "Chasing Pavements", "type": "lyrics", "content": "I've made up my mind\nDon't need to think it over\nIf I'm wrong, I am right\nDon't need to look no further\nThis ain't lust, I know this is love, but\nIf I tell the world, I'll never say enough\n'Cause it was not said to you\nAnd that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you\n\n[Chorus]\nShould I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements\nEven if it leads nowhere?\nOr would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?\nShould I leave it there?\nShould I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements\nEven if it leads nowhere?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI build myself up and fly around in circles\nWaiting as my heart drops\nAnd my back begins to tingle\nFinally, could this be it, or?\n\n[Chorus]\nShould I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements\nEven if it leads nowhere?\nOr would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?\nShould I leave it there?\nShould I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements\nEven if it leads nowhere? Yeah\n\n[Breakdown]\nShould I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements\nEven if it leads nowhere?\nOr would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?\nShould I leave it there?\nShould I give up, or should I just keep on chasing pavements?\nShould I just keep on chasing pavements?\nOh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nShould I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements\nEven if it leads nowhere?\nOr would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?\nShould I leave it there?\nShould I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements\nEven if it leads nowhere?\n\n", "author": "Adele"}
