{"title": "Million Years Ago", "type": "lyrics", "content": "\n[Verse 1]\nI only wanted to have fun\nLearning to fly, learning to run\nI let my heart decide the way\nWhen I was young\nDeep down, I must have always known\nThat this would be inevitable\nTo earn my stripes, I'd have to pay\nAnd bare my soul\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI know I'm not the only one\nWho regrets the things they've done\nSometimes, I just feel it's only me\nWho can't stand the reflection that they see\nI wish I could live a little more\nLook up to the sky, not just the floor\nI feel like my life is flashing by\nAnd all I can do is watch and cry\nI miss the air, I miss my friends\nI miss my mother, I miss it when\nLife was a party to be thrown\nBut that was a million years ago\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I walk around all of the streets\nWhere I grew up and found my feet\nThey can't look me in the eye\nIt's like they're scared of me\nI try to think of things to say\nLike a joke or a memory\nBut they don't recognize me now\nIn the light of day\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI know I'm not the only one\nWho regrets the things they've done\nSometimes, I just feel it's only me\nWho never became who they thought they'd be\nI wish I could live a little more\nLook up to the sky, not just the floor\nI feel like my life is flashing by\nAnd all I can do is watch and cry\nI miss the air, I miss my friends\nI miss my mother, I miss it when\nLife was a party to be thrown\nBut that was a million years ago\n\n[Outro]\nA million years ago\n\n", "author": "Adele"}
