{"title": "Oh My Soul", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Oh, my soul\nOh, how you worry\nOh, how you're weary from fearing\nYou lost control\nThis was the one thing\nYou didn't see coming\nAnd no one would blame you though\nIf you cried in private\nIf you tried to hide it away\nSo no one knows\nNo one will see\nIf you stop believing\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, my soul\nYou are not alone\nThere's a place where fear\nHas to face the God you know\nOne more day\nHe will make a way\nLet Him show you how\nYou can lay this down\n'Cause you're not alone\n\n[Verse 2]\nHere and now\nYou can be honest\nI won't try to promise\nThat someday it all works out\n'Cause this is the valley\nAnd even now\nHe is breathing on your dry bones\nAnd there will be dancing\nThere will be beauty where beauty was\nAsh and stone\nThis much I know\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, my soul\nYou are not alone\nThere's a place where fear\nHas to face the God you know\nOne more day\nHe will make a way\nLet Him show you how\nYou can lay this down\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm not strong enough\nI can't take anymore\nYou can lay it down\nYou can lay it down\nAnd my shipwrecked faith\nWill never get me to shore\nYou can lay it down\nYou can lay it down\nCan he find me here?\nCan he keep me, from going under?\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, my soul\nYou are not alone\nThere's a place where fear\nHas to face the God you know\nOne more day\nHe will make a way\nLet Him show you how\nYou can lay this down\n'Cause you're not alone\n\n[Outro]\nOh, my soul\nYou're not alone\n\n", "author": "Casting Crowns"}
