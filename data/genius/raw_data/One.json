{"title": "One", "type": "lyrics", "content": "\n[Verse 1]\nI can't remember anything\nCan't tell if this is true or dream\nDeep down inside I feel to scream\nThis terrible silence stops me\nNow that the war is through with me\nI'm waking up, I cannot see\nThat there's not much left of me\nNothing is real but pain now\n\n[Chours 1]\nHold my breath as I wish for death\nOh please God, wake me\n\n[Verse 2]\nBack in the womb it's much too real\nIn pumps life that I must feel\nBut can't look forward to reveal\nLook to the time when I'll live\nFed through the tube that sticks in me\nJust like a wartime novelty\nTied to machines that make me be\nCut this life off from me\n\n[Chours 1]\nHold my breath as I wish for death\nOh please God, wake me\n\n[Chours 2]\nNow the world is gone, I'm just one\nOh, God help me\n\n[Chours 1]\nHold my breath as I wish for death\nOh please God, help me\n\n[Bridge]\nDarkness imprisoning me\nAll that I see\nAbsolute horror\nI cannot live\nI cannot die\nTrapped in myself\nBody my holding cell\n\n[Verse 3]\nLandmine has taken my sight\nTaken my speech\nTaken my hearing\nTaken my arms\nTaken my legs\nTaken my soul\nLeft me with life in hell\n\n[Instrumental Outro]\n\n", "author": "Metallica"}
