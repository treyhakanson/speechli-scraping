Point 'em skyward, uh!\nHad a dream I was king; I woke up, still king\nThis rap game\u2019s nipple is mine for the milking\n'Til nobody else even fuckin\u2019 feels me, 'til it kills me\nI swear to God I\u2019ll be the fuckin\u2019 illest in this music\nThere is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free\nBut from now on I\u2019m refusing to ever give up\nOnly thing I ever gave up\u2019s usin' no more excuses\nExcuse me if my head is too big for this buildin'\nAnd pardon me if I\u2019m a cocky prick\nBut you cocks are slick, poppin\u2019 shit\nOn how you flipped your life around, crock of shit\nWho you dicks tryna kid?\nFlip \"dick,\" you did opposite: you stayed the same\n\u2018Cause \"cock\" backwards is still \"cock,\" you pricks!\nI love it when I tell 'em shove it\n\u2018Cause it wasn\u2019t that long ago when Marshall sat flustered\nLacked luster \u2018cause he couldn\u2019t cut mustard\nMuster up nothin', brain fuzzy\n\u2018Cause he\u2019s buzzin\u2019, woke up from that buzzer\nNow you wonder why he does it how he does it\nWasn\u2019t \u2018cause he had buzzards\nCirclin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?\nOr was it \u2018cause some bitches wrote him off?\nLittle hussy-ass scuzzes\nFuck it, guess it doesn\u2019t matter now, does it?\nWhat difference it make? What\u2019s it take?\nTo get it through your thick skulls that this ain\u2019t\nSome bullshit; people don\u2019t usually come back this way\nFrom a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place\nNow let these words be like a switchblade to a hater\u2019s ribcage!\nAnd let it be known from this day forward, I wanna just say\nThanks, \u2018cause your hate is what gave me the strength\nSo let them Bics raise, \u2018cause I came with 5'9\", but I feel like I\u2019m 6'8\"\n\n[Chorus: Bruno Mars]\nThis one's for you and me\nLivin' out our dreams\nWe are right where we should be\nWith my arms out wide, I open my eyes\nAnd now all I wanna see\nIs a sky full of lighters\nA sky full of lighters\n\n[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9\"]\nBy the time you hear this, I\u2019ll prob'ly already be outtie\nI advance like goin' from totin' iron to goin' and buyin\u2019\nFour or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi\nMy daddy told me: \"Slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it!\"\nAnd I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him\nThe same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic\nTell him how real he is, or how high I am\nOr how I would kill for him, for him to know it\nI cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back\nSo it's only right that I write 'til he can march right\nInto that post office and tell 'em to hang it up\nNow his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years\nI stop when I'm at the very top\nYou shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop\n\u2018Cause what goes up must come down\nYou goin' down on somethin' you don't wanna see, like a hairy box\nEvery hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now\nUsed to have to eat the cat to get the pussy\nNow I'm just the cat's meow, oow, outclass the count\nAlways down for the catchweight like Pacquiao\nY'all are doomed\nI remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me\nMy car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes\n\u2018Cause now I'm in the Aston; I went from havin'\nMy city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick\nAnd now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high\nAnd y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches\nOn a radio and TV, see me, we fly\nY'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams starin' at a beehive\nAnd how real is that? I remember signin' my first deal\nNow I'm the second best, I can deal with that\nNow Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag\n\n[Bridge: Bruno Mars]\nYou and I know what it's like\nTo be kicked down, forced to fight\nBut tonight, we're all right\nSo hold up your lights\nLet it shine, 'cause\u2014\n\n[Chorus: Bruno Mars]\nThis one's for you and me\nLivin' out our dreams\nWe are right where we should be\nWith my arms out wide, I open my eyes\nAnd now all I wanna see\nIs a sky full of lighters\nA sky full of lighters\n\n", "author": "Bad Meets Evil"}
