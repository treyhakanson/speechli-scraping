{"title": "Consequences", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Dirty tissues, trust issues\nGlasses on the sink, they didn't fix you\nLonely pillows in a stranger's bed\nLittle voices in my head\nSecret keeping, stop the bleeding\nLost a little weight because I wasn't eating\nAll the songs that I can't listen to, to tell the truth\n\n[Chorus 1]\nLoving you was young, and wild, and free\nLoving you was cool, and hot, and sweet\nLoving you was sunshine, safe and sound\nA steady place to let down my defenses\nBut loving you had consequences\n\n[Verse 2]\nHesitation, awkward conversation\nRunning on low expectation\nEvery siren that I was ignoring\nI'm paying for it\n\n[Chorus 1]\nLoving you was young, and wild, and free\nLoving you was cool, and hot, and sweet\nLoving you was sunshine, safe and sound\nA steady place to let down my defenses\nBut loving you had consequences\n\n[Bridge]\nNo, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\nSaid, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\nHey, yeah, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, mm\n\n[Chorus 2]\nLoving you was dumb, dark, and cheap\nLoving you will still take shots at me\nFound loving you was sunshine, but then it poured\nAnd I lost so much more than my senses\n'Cause loving you had consequences\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, loving you\n\n", "author": "Camila Cabello"}
