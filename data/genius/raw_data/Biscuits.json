{"title": "Biscuits", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Taking down your neighbor won't take you any higher\nI burned my own damn finger poking someone else's fire\nI've never gotten taller making someone else feel small\nIf you ain't got nothing nice to say, don't say nothing at all\n\n[Chorus]\nJust ho\u200be your own row, yeah, and raise your own babies\nSmoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies\nMend your own fences and own your own crazy\nMind your own biscuits and life will be gravy\nMind your own biscuits and life will be gravy\n\n[Verse 2]\nNobody's perfect, we've all lost and we've all lied\nMost of us have cheated, the rest of us have tried\nThe holiest of holies even slip from time to time\nWe've all got dirty laundry hanging on the line\n\n[Chorus]\nJust ho\u200be your own row, yeah, and raise your own babies\nSmoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies\nMend your own fences and own your own crazy\nMind your own biscuits and life will be gravy\nMind your own biscuits and life will be gravy\n\n[Bridge]\nPouring salt in my sugar won't make yours any sweeter\nPissing in my yard ain't gonna make yours any greener\nAnd I wouldn't know about the rocks in your shoes\nSo I'll just do me and, honey, you can just do you\n\n[Chorus]\nJust ho\u200be your own row, yeah, and raise your own babies\nSmoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies\nMend your own fences and own your own crazy\nMind your own biscuits and life will be gravy\nMind your own biscuits and life will be gravy\n\n", "author": "Kacey Musgraves"}
