{"title": "Lay Me Down", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Yes I do, I believe\nThat one day I will be where I was\nRight there, right next to you\nAnd it's hard, the days just seem so dark\nThe moon, the stars are nothing without you\nYour touch, your skin, where do I begin?\nNo words can explain the way I'm missing you\nDeny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside\nThese tears, they tell their own story\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTold me not to cry when you were gone\nBut the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong\n\n[Chorus]\nCan I lay by your side, next to you, you?\nAnd make sure you're alright\nI'll take care of you\nI don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm reaching out to you\nCan you hear my call?\nThis hurt that I've been through\nI'm missing you, missing you like crazy\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou told me not to cry when you were gone\nBut the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong\n\n[Chorus]\nCan I lay by your side, next to you, you?\nAnd make sure you're alright\nI'll take care of you\nI don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight\n\n[Outro]\nLay me down tonight, lay me by your side\nLay me down tonight, lay me by your side\nCan I lay by your side, next to you, you\n\n", "author": "Sam Smith"}
