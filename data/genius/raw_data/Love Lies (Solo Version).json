{"title": "Love Lies (Solo Version)", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe\nI need a lover to trust, tell me you're on my side\nAre you down for the ride?\nIt's not easy for someone to catch my eye\nBut I've been waitin' for you for my whole damn life\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it\nI see you're focused, yeah you're so independent\nIt's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it\nYou've got something to say and I'm here to listen\n\n[Chorus]\nSo baby, tell me where your love lies\nWaste the day and spend the night\nUnderneath the sunrise\nShow me where your love lies\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've been so into your mystery\nIs it because of our history?\nAre you into me?\nWhen it feels so good, but it's bad for you\nCan't say I don't want it 'cause I know I do\nCome on over, I need your company\nCravin' that synergy\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it\nI see you're focused, yeah you're so independent\nIt's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it\nYou've got something to say and I'm here to listen\n\n[Chorus]\nSo baby\nTell me, tell me\nUnderneath the sunrise\nOh\n\n[Bridge]\nAre you down? Don't hide it\nFeelin' me, you don't gotta deny it\nBaby you gon' make me overnight it\nTell me, are you down?\nTell me, are you down?\nDon't hide it\nYou don't gotta deny it\nTell me, tell me, are you down?\n\n[Chorus]\nTell me where your love lies\nWaste the day and spend the night\nUnderneath the sunrise\nTell me where your love lies\nShow me where your love lies\nOh, ah\n\n", "author": "Normani"}
