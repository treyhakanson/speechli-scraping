{"title": "I Hate Love Songs", "type": "lyrics", "content": "I hate Shakespeare and Gosling and cakes with white frosting\nTwo names in a heart-shaped tattoo\nI think cupid is stupid and violets are purple not blue\nI hate catching bouquets, the honeymoon phase\nAnd letterman jackets don't fit\nYour eyes can't hold stars and you'd die if your heart really skipped\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate love songs\nYeah, I really do\nI hate love songs\nBut I love you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI hate pink hearts with glitter and Valentine's dinner\nAnd roses just die in a week\nWe were drunk when we met so we don't know our anniversary (Whoops)\nOh, and I'm far too vain to kiss in the rain\nThe clouds, they aren't numbered to nine\nAnd you make me feel something\nBut it sure as hell ain't butterflies\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate love songs\nYeah, I really do\nI hate love songs\nBut I love you\nYeah\n\n[Interlude]\nI really do\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I'll always love you but I don't have to sing it\n\"For worse or for better\" don't rhyme\nThey say I got the right one so now I should write one\nBut I'd rather just show you tonight\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I hate love songs\nYeah, I really do\nI hate love songs\nBut I love you\nI hate love songs\nThe old and the new\nI hate love songs\nBut I love you\n\n", "author": "Kelsea Ballerini"}
