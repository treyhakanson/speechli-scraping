{"title": "You're Not There", "type": "lyrics", "content": "I only got you in my stories\nAnd you know I tell them right\nI remember you and I, when I'm awake at night\nSo give it up for fallen glory\nI never got to say goodbye\nI wish I could ask for just a bit more time\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nEvery step I take, you used to lead the way\nNow I'm terrified to face it on my own\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're not there\nTo celebrate the man that you made\nYou're not there\nTo share in my success and mistakes\nIs it fair?\nYou'll never know the person I'll be\nYou're not there\nWith me...\n\n[Verse 2]\nThough I know that you're not there\nI still write you all these songs\nIt's like, you got the right to know what's going on\nAs I struggle to remember how you used to look and sound\nAt times I still think I can spot you in the crowd\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nEvery step I take, you used to lead the way\nNow I'm terrified to face it on my own\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're not there\nTo celebrate the man that you made\nYou're not there\nTo share in my success and mistakes\nIs it fair?\nYou'll never know the person I'll be\nYou're not there\nWith me...\n\n[Break]\nTime can heal your wounds if\nYou're strong and standing tall\nI've been doing all of that, it didn't help at all\nThey say \"You'll grow older, and it'll get better still\"\nYes, I will, but no it won't\nThey don't get it, cause...\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're not there\nTo celebrate the man that you made\nYou're not there\nTo share in my success and mistakes\nIs it fair?\nYou'll never know the person I'll be\nYou're not there\nWith me...\n\n", "author": "Lukas Graham"}
