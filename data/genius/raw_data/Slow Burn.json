{"title": "Slow Burn", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Born in a hurry, always late\nHaven't been early since '88\nTexas is hot, I can be cold\nGrandma cried when I pierced my nose\nGood in a glass, good on green\nGood when you're putting your hands all over me\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm alright with a slow burn\nTaking my time, let the world turn\nI'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright\nIf we burn it down and it takes all night\nIt's a slow burn, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn Tennessee, the sun's goin' down\nBut in Beijing, they're heading out to work\nYou know the bar down the street don't close for an hour\nWe should take a walk and look at all the flowers\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm alright with a slow burn\nTaking my time, let the world turn\nI'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright\nIf we burn it down and it takes all night\nIt's a slow burn\n\n[Bridge]\nWhatever feels good\n\n[Outro]\nOld soul, waiting my turn\nI know a few things, but I still got a lot to learn\nSo I'm alright with a slow burn, slow burn, slow burn\nI'm alright with a slow burn\n\n", "author": "Kacey Musgraves"}
