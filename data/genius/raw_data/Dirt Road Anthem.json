{"title": "Dirt Road Anthem", "type": "lyrics", "content": "I'm chilling on a dirt road\nLaid back swerving like I'm George Jones\nSmoke Rolling out the window\nAn' ice cold beer sitting' in the console\nMemory lane up in the headlights\nIt's got me reminiscing on them good times\nI'm turning off of real life, driving' that's right\nI'm hitting' easy street on mud tires\n\n[Verse 1]\nBack in the day Potts farm was the place to go\nLoad the truck up, hit the dirt road\nJump the barbwire, spread the word\nLight the bonfire, then call the girls\nThe king in the can and the Marlboro man\nJack 'n' Jim were a few good men\nWhere ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too\nBetter watch out for the boys in blue\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd all this small town he said, she said\nAin't it funny how rumors spread\nLike I know something ya'll don't know\nMan that talk is getting old\nYa better mind your business, man, watch your mouth\nBefore I have to knock that loud mouth out\nI'm tired of talking, man, ya'll ain't listening\nThem old dirt roads is what ya'll missing\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm chilling on a dirt road\nLaid back swerving like I'm George Jones\nSmoke Rolling out the window\nAn' ice cold beer sitting' in the console\nMemory lane up in the headlights\nIt's got me reminiscing on them good times\nI'm turning off of real life, driving' that's right\nI'm hitting' easy street on mud tires\n\n[Verse 3]\nI sit back and think about them good ole days\nThe way we were raised, and our southern ways\nAnd we like cornbread, and biscuits\nAnd if it's broke round here we fix it\nI can take ya'll where ya need to go\nDown to my hood, back in them woods\n\n[Verse 4]\nWe do it different 'round here, that's right\nBut we sure do it good, and we do it all night\nSee, if you really wanna know how it feels\nTo get off the road with trucks and four wheels\nJump on in, and man, tell your friends\nWe'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm chilling on a dirt road\nLaid back swerving like I'm George Jones\nSmoke Rolling out the window\nAn' ice cold beer sitting' in the console\nMemory lane up in the headlights\nIt's got me reminiscing on them good times\nI'm turning off of real life, driving' that's right\nI'm hitting' easy street on mud tires\n\nI'm chilling on a dirt road\nLaid back swerving like I'm George Jones\nSmoke Rolling out the window\nAn' ice cold beer sitting' in the console\nMemory lane up in the headlights\nIt's got me reminiscing on them good times\nI'm turning off of real life, driving' that's right\nI'm hitting' easy street on mud tires\nThat's right\n\n", "author": "Jason Aldean"}
