Screw you!\"\nWhen it talks to you like you don't belong\nOr tells you you're in the wrong field\nWhen something's in your mitochondrial\n'Cause it latched on to you, like\u2014\n\n[Verse 1]\nKnock knock, let the devil in\nManevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'\nThis medicine's screamin', \"L-L-L-Let us in!\"\nL-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe\nBedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago\nLiquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'\nWicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent\nOf elephant manure\u2014hell, I meant Kahl\u00faa\nScrew it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants\nAnd blew up my-my-myself again\nVolkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin\nMayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin\nFilet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik\nHow can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida\nProof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then\nDr. Dre said, \"Hell yeah!\"\nAnd I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man\nAnd I know they're gonna hate\nBut I don't care, I barely can wait\nTo hit 'em with the snare and the bass\nSquare in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced\nBecause they're gonna taste my\u2014\n\n[Chorus]\nVenom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum\nAnd I'm not knowin' when I'm\nEver gonna slow up and I'm\nReady to snap any moment I'm\nThinkin' it's time to go get 'em\nThey ain't gonna know what hit 'em\n(W-W-When they get bit with the\u2014)\nVenom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum\nAnd I'm not knowin' when I'm\nEver gonna slow up and I'm\nReady to snap any moment I'm\nThinkin' it's time to go get 'em\nThey ain't gonna know what hit 'em\n(W-W-When they get bit with the\u2014)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI said knock knock, let the devil in\nShotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen\nCocked, fuck around and catch a hot one\nIt-it's evident I'm not done\nV-Venomous, the thoughts spun\nLike a web and you just caught in 'em\nHeld against your will like a hubcap or mud flap\nBeat strangler attack\nSo this ain't gonna feel like a love tap\nEat painkiller pills, fuck up the track\nLike, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick\nThrew the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'\nInto ya, the back of it just mangled steel\nMy Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill\nWith the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin\nSlim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)\nTranslation, I will probably kill us both\nWhen I end up backin' into ya\nYou ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya\nWhen you're bit with the\u2014\n\n[Chorus]\nVenom, adrenaline momentum\nAnd I'm not knowin' when I'm\nEver gonna slow up and I'm\nReady to snap any moment I'm\nThinkin' it's time to go get 'em\nThey ain't gonna know what hit 'em\n(W-W-When they get bit with the\u2014)\nVenom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum\nAnd I'm not knowin' when I'm\nEver gonna slow up and I'm\nReady to snap any moment I'm\nThinkin' it's time to go get 'em\nThey ain't gonna know what hit 'em\n(W-W-When they get bit with the\u2014)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI said knock knock, let the devil in\nAlien, E-E-Elliott phone home\nAin't no telling when this chokehold\nOn this game will end, I'm loco\nBecame a Symbiote, so\nMy fangs are in your throat, ho\nYou're snake-bitten with my\u2014venom\nWith the ballpoint pen I'm\nGun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot\nTire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots\nFired up and caught fire, juggernaut\nPunk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc\n'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock\nWhy the fuck not, you only get one shot\nAte shit 'til I can't taste it\nChased it with straight liquor\nThen paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint\nAnd awake with a headache\nAnd I take anything in rectangular shape\nThen I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to\n'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you\nSo escapin' me is impossible\nI latch onto you like a\u2014parasite\nAnd I probably ruined your parents' life\nAnd your childhood too\n'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on\nI'm responsible for you retarded fools\nI'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to\nYou marvel that? Eddie Brock is you\nAnd I'm the suit, so call me\u2014\n\n[Chorus]\nVenom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum\nAnd I'm not knowin' when I'm\nEver gonna slow up and I'm\nReady to snap any moment I'm\nThinkin' it's time to go get 'em\nThey ain't gonna know what hit 'em\n(W-W-When they get bit with the\u2014)\nVenom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum\nAnd I'm not knowin' when I'm\nEver gonna slow up and I'm\nReady to snap any moment I'm\nThinkin' it's time to go get 'em\nThey ain't gonna know what hit 'em\n(W-W-When they get bit with the\u2014)\n\n", "author": "Eminem"}
