(Oh-woah)\n\n[Chorus]\nTell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?\nFeelin' so high, but too far away to hold me\nYou know I'm the one who put you up there\nName in the sky, does it ever get lonely?\nThinking you could live without me\nThinking you could live without me\nBaby, I'm the one who put you up there\nI don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)\n\n", "author": "Halsey"}
