{"title": "Play It Again", "type": "lyrics", "content": "She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate\nTan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate\nI was lookin' for her boyfriend\nThinkin', \"no way she ain't got one\"\nSoon as I sat down I was fallin' in love\nTryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup\nTalkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck\nShe jumped up and cut me off\n\n[Chorus]\nShe was like, \"oh my God, this is my song\nI've been listenin' to the radio all night long\nSittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is\"\nShe was like, \"come here, boy, I wanna dance!\"\n'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand\nSpinnin' me around till it faded out\nAnd she gave me a kiss\nAnd she said, \"play it again, play it again, play it again\"\nAnd I said, \"play it again, play it again, play it again\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'd gave that DJ my last dime\nIf he would have played it just one more time\nBut a little while later\nWe were sittin' in the drive in my truck\nBefore I walked her to the door\nI was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too\nBut I stopped real quick when I heard that groove\nMan, you should have seen her light up\n\n[Chorus 2]\nShe was like, \"oh my God, this is my song\nWe've been listenin' to the radio all night long\nI can't believe that it came back on, but here it is\"\nShe was like, \"come here boy, I wanna dance!\"\n'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand\nSpinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss\nAnd I said, \"play it again, play it again, play it again\"\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd she said, \"play it again, play it again, play it again\"\nThe next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars\nYou should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar\n\n[Chorus 3]\nShe was like, \"oh my God, this is my song\nI've been listenin' to the radio all night long\nSittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is\"\nShe was like, \"come here boy, I wanna dance!\"\n'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand\nSpinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss\nAnd she said, \"play it again, play it again, play it again\"\nAnd I said, \"play it again, play it again, play it again\"\n\n[Outro]\nYeah play it again, play it again, play it again\nSomebody play it again, play it again, play it again\n\n", "author": "Luke Bryan"}
