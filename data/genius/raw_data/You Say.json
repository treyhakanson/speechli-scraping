{"title": "You Say", "type": "lyrics", "content": "I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I\u2019m not enough\nEvery single lie that tells me I will never measure up\nAm I more than just the sum of every high and every low?\nRemind me once again just who I am, because I need to know\n\n[Chorus]\nYou say I am loved when I can\u2019t feel a thing\nYou say I am strong when I think I am weak\nYou say I am held when I am falling short\nWhen I don\u2019t belong, You say I am Yours\nAnd I believe, I believe\nWhat You say of me\nI believe\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe only thing that matters now is everything You think of me\nIn You I find my worth, in You I find my identity\n\n[Chorus]\nYou say I am loved when I can\u2019t feel a thing\nYou say I am strong when I think I am weak\nYou say I am held when I am falling short\nWhen I don\u2019t belong, You say I am Yours\nAnd I believe, I believe\nWhat You say of me\nI believe\n\n[Bridge]\nTaking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet\nYou have every failure, God\nYou'll have every victory\n\n[Chorus]\nYou say I am loved when I can\u2019t feel a thing\nYou say I am strong when I think I am weak\nYou say I am held when I am falling short\nWhen I don\u2019t belong, You say I am Yours\nAnd I believe, I believe\nWhat You say of me\nI believe\n\n[Outro]\nOh, I believe\nYes, I believe\nWhat You say of me\nOh, I believe\n\n", "author": "Lauren Daigle"}
