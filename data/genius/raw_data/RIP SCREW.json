Southside)\nRest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly\nI'm gonna let you know the move\nI'm gonna let you know the move\nI'm gonna take you on a cruise\nI'm gonna take you home and screw\n(Southside)\n\n[Verse 1: Swae Lee & DJ Screw]\nAnd that's all I've been sayin' (Southside)\nIf you fall for the games then you're the one playin'\nBecause it's too much money out here\nAnd there's too many honeys out here\nFeel like I tripped off the drank, that's weird\nFeel like I tripped off the drank, that's weird\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott]\nRest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly\nOh my God, I just can feel the love\nDroptop with the windows up\nJump inside, oh, won't you roll with us?\nMake the devil bite the angel dust\nShawty got a thing for us\nShawty what you want\nTell me what you like\nTell me what you want\n\n[Verse 2: Travis Scott]\nRest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly, yeah\nI just took a four to the head like \"man\"\nDrop the top on the slab like \"man\"\nOff the top of the dome like \"man\"\nNothin' beatin' home like \"man\"\nIn the Screw tape zone like \"man\"\nI go Pimp C on the phone like \"man\"\nFlip say platinum, don't do chrome like \"man\"\nHad the Southside fade, now let the braids hang\nThis shit S.U.C smooth like \"man\"\nRest in peace Screw like \"man\"\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott]\nRest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly\nOh my God, I just can feel the love\nDrop top with the windows up\n\n[Outro: Travis Scott]\nScrew found international sound because\u2014\nThroughout the South, and it's new to, um...\nShawty got a thing for us\n\n", "author": "Travis Scott"}
