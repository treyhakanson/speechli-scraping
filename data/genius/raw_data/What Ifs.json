(bet I'd like it)\nWell we ain't never gonna know unless we try it\n\n[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]\nWhat if I was made for you and you were made for me?\nWhat if this is it, what if it's meant to be?\nWhat if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?\nWhat if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?\nAnd the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss\nWhat if one of these days baby, I go and change your name?\nWhat if I loved all these what ifs away?\nAwe yeah\nC'mon\n\n[Bridge: Kane Brown]\nYou say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you?\nWhat if I find somebody else and I don't need you?\nDamn\n\n[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]\nWhat if I was made for you and you were made for me?\nWhat if this is it, what if it's meant to be?\nWhat if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?\nWhat if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?\nAnd the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss\nWhat if one of these days baby, I go and change your name?\nWhat if I loved all these what ifs away?\n\n[Outro: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]\nAway (away)\nWhat if?\n\n", "author": "Kane Brown"}
