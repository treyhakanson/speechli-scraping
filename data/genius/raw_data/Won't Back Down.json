Are you insane?!\nTryin' to talk over me in the car\nShut the fuck up while my shit's playin'!\nI'm a shit stain on the underwear of life\nWhat's the saying? Where there's thunder, there is lightning\nAnd they say that it never strikes twice in the same place\nThen how the fuck have I been hit six times\nIn three different locations on four separate occasions?\nAnd you can bet your stankin' ass\nThat I've come to smash everything in my path\nFork was in the road, took the psycho path\nPoison Ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash\nSo hit the dance-floor, cutie, while I do my duty\nOn this microphone; shake your booty, shorty!\nI'm the shit\u2014why you think Proof used to call me \"Doody\"?\n\n[Chorus: P!nk]\nYou can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards\nYou can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards\nBut I won't back down\nOh no, I won't back down, oh no\n\n", "author": "Eminem"}
