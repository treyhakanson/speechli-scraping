Uh, uh\n\n[Verse 1]\nI used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this\nSo I had to grind like that to shine like this\nAnd the amount of time I spent on some locked-up shit\nIn the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists\nSeen my dreams unfold, nightmares come true\nIt was time to marry the game and I said, \"Yeah, I do\"\nIf you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view\nGot a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said achoo\nLike a nigga sneezed, nigga please, 'fore them triggers squeeze\nI'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between\nOf what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lion-hearted\nThey love me when I was stuck and they hated when I departed\nI go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm a artist\nNo crawlin', went straight to walkin', with foreigns in my garages\nAll foreign bitches m\u00e9nagin', fuckin', suckin' and swallowin'\nAnything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em\nI did it without a album\nI did shit with Mariah\nLil' nigga, I'm on fire\nIcy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga, I'm flyer\nWhen I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased\nThen I bought that new Ferrari, hater, rest in peace\nHater, rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot\nPhantom so big, can't even fit in the parking spot\nYou ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, then what you talkin' 'bout?\nGangstas move in silence, nigga, and I don't talk a lot\nI don't say a word, I don't say a word\nWas on my grind and now I got what I deserve, fuck nigga!\nMaybach Music\n\n[Verse 2]\nHold up, wait a minute (Minute), y'all thought I was finished? (Whoa)\nWhen I bought that Aston Martin, y'all thought it was rented? (Yeah)\nFlexin' on these niggas, I'm like Popeye on his spinach\nDouble M, yeah that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm lieutenant\nI\u2019m the type to count a million cash then grind like I\u2019m broke\nThat Lambo my new bitch, she don't ride like my Ghost\nI'm ridin' around my city with my hand strapped on my toast\n'Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home\n'Cause my mama need that bill money, my son need some milk\nThese niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around, get killed\nYou fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked\n'Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke, no\nAll I know is murder, when it come to me\nI got young niggas that's rollin', I got niggas throwin' B's\nI done did the DOA's, I done did the KOD's\nEvery time I'm in that bitch, I get to throwin' 30 G's\nBut now I'm hangin' out that drop head, I'm ridin' down on Collins (Skrt)\nThey let my nigga Ern back home, that young nigga be wildin' (Let's go)\nWe young niggas, we mobbin' (Mobbin'), like Batman and we're robbin' (Whoa)\nThis two-door Maybach with my seat all reclinin'\nI'm like, \"Real nigga, what up? Real nigga, what up?\"\nIf you ain't about that murder game, then pussy nigga, shut up!\nIf you diss me in your raps I'll get yo' pussy-ass stuck up\nWhen you touchdown in my hood, no that tour life ain't good\nCatch me down in MIA at that Heat game on wood\nWith that Puma life on my feet like that little engine I could\nBoy, I slide down on your block (Block), bike on twelve o'clock (Rah)\nAnd they be throwin' deuces on the same nigga they watch (Meek Milly)\nAnd I'm the king of my city 'cause I'm still callin' them shots\nAnd these lames talkin' that bullshit the same niggas that flopped\nI'm the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids, that lock\nThe same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot\nAnd these niggas hatin' on me, hoes waitin' on me\nStill on that hood shit, my Rolls-Royce on E\nThey gon' remember me, I say remember me\nSo much money, have yo' friends turn in yo' enemies\nAnd when there\u2019s beef, I turn my enemies to memories\nWith them bricks they go for 40, ain't no 10 a key\nHold up, broke nigga turned rich (Rich), love the game like Mitch\nAnd if I leave, you think them pretty hoes gon' still suck my dick?\nIt was somethin' 'bout that Rollie when it first touched my wrist\nHad me feelin' like that dope boy when he first touched that brick\nI'm gone\nWoo!\n\n", "author": "Meek Mill"}
