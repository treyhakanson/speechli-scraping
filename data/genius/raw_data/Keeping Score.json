{"title": "Keeping Score", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Someday we're gonna look back on a night like tonight\nThe car I pulled up in, the necklace you're wearing won't even cross our minds\nSomeday we're gonna blink twice, say it happens like that\nHow much money we saved up for the time that we gave up\nWell, it'll all just be math\n\n[Chorus: Dan + Shay & Kelly Clarkson]\nI know I'm only human\nDon't know how many sunsets I got left\nAnd I don't wanna ruin\nThis moment by wondering what comes next\nI just wanna love you like it's all I'm living for\nHold you close, enjoy you more\nAnd spend a little less time keeping score\n\n[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson  with Dan + Shay]\nIf we're rich to somebody, we're poor to somebody else\nWe could be happy and nameless\nOr broken and famous\nBut, from what I can tell\nIs that it doesn't really matter\nYou can't take it with you when you go\nLife is only getting faster (life is only getting faster)\nSo, baby, I'd rather take tonight nice and slow\n\n[Chorus: Dan + Shay & Kelly Clarkson]\n'Cause I know I'm only human\nDon't know how many sunsets I got left\nAnd I don't wanna ruin\nThis moment by wondering what comes next\nI just wanna love you like it's all I'm living for\nHold you close, enjoy you more\nAnd spend a little less time keeping score\n\n[Bridge: Dan + Shay with Kelly Clarkson]\nBe with me now\nBe with me right now\nBe with me right here, right now\nBe with me now\nBe with me right now\nBe with me right here, right now\n\n[Outro: Dan + Shay & Kelly Clarkson]\nI know I'm only human\nDon't know how many sunsets I got left\nAnd I don't wanna ruin\nThis moment by wondering what comes next\nI just wanna love you like it's all I'm living for\nHold you close, enjoy you more\nAnd spend a little less time keeping score\nOh, yeah\nKeeping score\n\n", "author": "Dan + Shay"}
