Oh\nOf all of the plans that I could have made\nOf all of the nights that I couldn't sleep, oh\n\n[Pre-Chorus: AJ and Nick]\nWhat's a girl like you doing in a place like this?\nIn a crowded room, what are the odds?\n(What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?)\nGetting close to you, but here we are\n\n[Chorus: Nick]\nWhat are the chances that we'd end up dancing?\nLike two in a million, like once in a life\nThat I could have found you, put my arms around you\nLike two in a million, like once in a life\nWhat are the chances?\n\n[Bridge: Howie and Kevin]\nIs it love? Is it fate?\nWho am I? Who's to say?\nDon't know exactly what it means (Ooh, oh, yeah)\n''Is it love? Is it fate?''\n''Where it leads, who can say?''\n''Maybe you and I were meant to be''\n\n[Chorus: Nick and Brian]\nWhat, what\nWhat are the chances that we'd end up dancing?\nTwo in a million, once in a life\nThat I could have found you, put my arms around you (My arms around you)\nTwo in a million (It's like two in a million), once in a life, yeah (Woah)\nWhat are the chances? (What are the chances?)\nTwo in a million, once in a life\nWhat are the chances? (What are the chances?)\nTwo in a million, once in a life\n\n[Outro: Brian]\nWhat if I never run into you?\nAnd what if you never smiled at me?\n\n", "author": "Backstreet Boys"}
