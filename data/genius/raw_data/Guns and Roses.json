{"title": "Guns and Roses", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Hey, have you ever loved somebody so much you can\u2019t stand it but can\u2019t do without 'em?\nDo anything for 'em cause you truly do adore 'em\nLike dedicate songs, write poems\nBut they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore 'em\nBut you feel like they feel like you ain\u2019t right for 'em\nTherefore your heart\u2019s torn\nBetween bein' with 'em forever, leavin' 'em never\nBut it seem like you arguin', fightin' over whatever\nMaybe we can leave, find someone better\nEven though you know you\u2019ve never known none better\nMy heart say \"nah, she can\u2019t leave, won't let her\"\nBeen head over heels since the very day I met her\nFell so deep in love I ain\u2019t been able to get up\nSometimes I want some peace of mind and she won\u2019t shut up\nLove her to death, don\u2019t know whether to kiss her or kill her\n\n[Hook: P!nk]\nShould\u2019ve known it\nFrom the start it was already over\nWe were just too dumb to notice\nAnd we'd pray but\nEven love couldn\u2019t save us\nWe'd wake up\nOn a bed of guns and roses\nAnd we don\u2019t know which one to choose\nWhen either way, we\u2019re gonna lose\nStill we'd pray but\nEven love couldn\u2019t save us\nWe'd wake up\nOn a bed of guns and roses\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nI guess I\u2019d rather suffer with her than be miserable without her\nI buy a lot of Prada, Gucci and Balenciaga\nTo keep her content, and keep down the nonsense\nBut every corner we turn around's a conflict\nMostly dumb shit, like who she run with\nWhere the fuck you been? Your pants \u2013 they don\u2019t fit\nReally, honestly speaking, some things I don\u2019t get\nNo matter how much she try she can\u2019t make it make more sense\nTherefore, here we go again\nScreamin', yellin' at the top of our lungs, she goin' in\nSaying the kind of shit I be like \"if you was a man\nI would go in your shit, for real, no shit\"\nBut I love her so much that I can\u2019t forget\nThat the feel of a kiss, it could heal when I\u2019m sick\nStill, I don\u2019t like to feel like this\nIf I didn\u2019t miss her, I would try to get her killed right quick\n\n[Hook: P!nk]\nShould\u2019ve known it\nFrom the start it was already over\nWe were just too dumb to notice\nAnd we'd pray but\nEven love couldn\u2019t save us\nWe'd wake up\nOn a bed of guns and roses\nAnd we don\u2019t know which one to choose\nWhen either way, we\u2019re gonna lose\nStill we'd pray but\nEven love couldn\u2019t save us\nWe'd wake up\nOn a bed of guns and roses\n\n[Bridge: P!nk]\nEvery time we say our goodbyes\nA little piece of my heart breaks off inside\nI don\u2019t really ever know why\nIf I could live without you I\u2019d try\n\n[Hook: P!nk]\nShould\u2019ve known it\nFrom the start it was already over\nWe were just too dumb to notice\nAnd we'd pray but\nEven love couldn\u2019t save us\nWe'd wake up\nOn a bed of guns and roses\nAnd we don\u2019t know which one to choose\nWhen either way, we\u2019re gonna lose\nStill we'd pray but\nEven love couldn\u2019t save us\nWe'd wake up\nOn a bed of guns and roses\n\n", "author": "T.I."}
