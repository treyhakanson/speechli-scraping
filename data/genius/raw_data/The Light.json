{"title": "The Light", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Like an unsung melody\nThe truth is waiting there for you to find it\nIt's not a blight but a remedy\nA clear reminder of how it began\nDeep inside your memory\nTurned away as you struggled to find it\nYou heard the call as you walked away\nA voice of calm from within the silence\nAnd for what seemed an eternity\nYou wait, and hoping it would call out again\nYou heard the shadow reckoning\nThen your fears seemed to keep you blinded\nYou held your guard as you walked away\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you think all is forsaken\nListen to me now (all's not forsaken)\nYou need never feel broken again\nSometimes darkness\nCan show you the light\n\n[Verse 2]\nAn unforgivable tragedy\nThe answer isn't where you think you'd find it\nPrepare yourself for the reckoning\nFor when your world seems to crumble again\nDon't be afraid to turn away\nYou're the one who can redefine it\nDon't let hope become a memory\nLet the shadow permeate your mind and\nReveal the thoughts that were tucked away\nSo that the door can be opened again\nWithin your darkest memories\nLies the answer if you dare to find it\nDon't let hope become a memory\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you think all is forsaken\nListen to me now (all's not forsaken)\nYou need never feel broken again\nSometimes darkness\nCan show you the light\n\n[Bridge]\nSickening, weakening\nDon't let another somber pariah consume your soul\nYou need strengthening, toughening\nIt takes an inner dark to rekindle the fire burning in you\nIgnite the fire within you\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you think all is forsaken\nListen to me now (all's not forsaken)\nYou need never feel broken again\nSometimes darkness\nCan show you the light\nDon't ignore\nListen to me now\nYou need never feel broken again\nSometimes darkness\nCan show you the light\n\n", "author": "Disturbed"}
