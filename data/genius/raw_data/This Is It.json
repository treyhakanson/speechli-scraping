{"title": "This Is It", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Way up in the mountains, four thousand feet high\nThere's a trail through the trees to a cliff where Carolina meets the sky\nOh, and there's a view I just can't describe\nNo, I'm not there yet, just a few more steps, baby wait\nOkay, you can open your eyes\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking about\nLooking out, can't you see forever?\nTake my hand, just take it in\nThis is a moment we won't forget\nOn top of the world, here, together\nIf there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, this is it\n\n[Verse 2]\nGirl I know that you've been waiting and talking to your friends\nWondering if and wondering where and wondering when\nWell I've been waiting too, holding on to this ring\nFor the right words to say, for the right time and place, for me to get on one knee\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking about\nLooking out, can't you see forever?\nTake my hand, just take it in\nThis is a moment we won't forget\nOn top of the world here together\nIf there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, well this is it\nThis is it\n\n[Bridge]\nNow you're walking down the aisle\nAnd I can't help but smile\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is it, this is now, it's what I've been talking about\nLooking out, I can see forever\nSo take my hand, just take it in\nThis is a moment we won't forget\nOn top of the world, here, together\nSurrounded by our family and our friends\nIf there ever was a time for a perfect kiss\nThis is it\n\n", "author": "Scotty McCreery"}
