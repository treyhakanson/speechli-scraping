{"title": "Midnight Train", "type": "lyrics", "content": "I choose me, and I know that\u2019s selfish, love\nYou are a dream, and I can\u2019t thank you enough\nBut I give another piece of me away\nEvery wakin' day that I\u2019m with you\nAm I a monster? What will your family think of me?\nThey brought me in, they helped me out with everything\nBut I give a little piece of me away\nEvery single day\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train\nI got my reasons, but darlin' I can\u2019t explain\nI\u2019ll always love you\nBut tonight\u2019s the night I choose to walk away\nBah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo\nBah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo\n\n[Verse 2]\nLove you so much that I have to let you go\nI\u2019ll miss your touch and the secrets we both know\nBut it would be wrong for me to stay\nAnd I\u2019ll just give you hope\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train\nI got my reasons, but darlin' I can\u2019t explain\nI\u2019ll always love you\nBut tonight\u2019s the night I choose to walk away\nI can\u2019t stop cryin', I hate that I\u2019ve caused you pain\nBut I can\u2019t deny it, I just don\u2019t feel the same\nI\u2019ll always love you\nBut tonight\u2019s the night I choose to walk away\nBah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo\nBah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo\nSo I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train\nI got my reasons, but darlin' I can\u2019t explain\nI\u2019ll always love you\nBut tonight\u2019s the night I choose to walk away\n\n", "author": "Sam Smith"}
