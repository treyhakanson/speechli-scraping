{"title": "Supermarket Flowers", "type": "lyrics", "content": "I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill\nI threw the day old tea from the cup\nPacked up the photo album Matthew had made\nMemories of a life that's been loved\nTook the get well soon cards and stuffed animals\nPoured the old ginger beer down the sink\nDad always told me, \"Don't you cry when you're down\"\nBut mum, there's a tear every time that I blink\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know\nA heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I'll sing Hallelujah\nYou were an angel in the shape of my mum\nWhen I fell down you'd be there holding me up\nSpread your wings as you go\nWhen God takes you back\nHe'll say, \"Hallelujah, you're home\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nI fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up\nFolded your nightgowns neatly in a case\nJohn says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek\nAnd wiped a tear from the side of my face\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know\nA life with love is a life that's been lived\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I'll sing Hallelujah\nYou were an angel in the shape of my mum\nWhen I fell down you'd be there holding me up\nSpread your wings as you go\nWhen God takes you back\nHe'll say, \"Hallelujah, you're home\"\n\n[Outro/Chorus]\nHallelujah\nYou were an angel in the shape of my mum\nYou got to see the person I have become\nSpread your wings and I know\nThat when God took you back\nHe said, \"Hallelujah, you're home\"\n\n", "author": "Ed Sheeran"}
