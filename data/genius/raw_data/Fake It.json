I'm not saying that I have this capacity because it's hard to develop that capacity on your own, when you're being stopped at every turn\n\n[Verse 1]\nDrive around, night time, nowhere to go\nMelt me down, I'm like wax to your jokes\nLost and found, knocking heads, laying low\nAnd there's no point reliving crimes to lose this\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nStill wanna waste all of my time\nI wanna waste all of my time\nStill wanna waste all of my time\nI wanna waste all of my time\nWith you\n\n[Chorus]\nOh my lover, my lover, my love\nWe can never go back\nWe can only do our best to recreate\nDon't turn over, turn over the page\nWe should rip it straight out\nThen let's try our very best to fake it\n\n[Verse 2]\nShow me joy, flower through disarray\nLet's destroy, each mistake that we made\nThen restore the color back to the grey\nThere's no pride in sharing scars to prove it\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nStill wanna waste all of my time\nI wanna waste all of my time\nStill wanna waste all of my time\nI wanna waste all of my time\nWith you\n\n[Chorus]\nOh my lover, my lover, my love\nWe can never go back\nWe can only do our best to recreate\nDon't turn over, turn over the page\nWe should rip it straight out\nThen let's try our very best to fake it\n\n[Bridge]\nHelp me turn a blind eye\nDays and nights we lost to weakness\nHelp me turn a blind eye\nDays and nights we lost to weakness\n\n[Chorus]\nOh my lover, my lover, my love\nWe can never go back\nWe can only do our best to recreate\nDon't turn over, turn over the page\nWe should rip it straight out\nThen let's do our very best to fake it\nOh my lover, my lover, my love\nWe can never go back\nWe can only do our best to recreate\nDon't turn over, turn over the page\nWe should rip it straight out\nThen let's do our very best to fake it\n\n", "author": "Bastille"}
