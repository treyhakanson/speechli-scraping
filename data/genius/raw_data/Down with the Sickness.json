Oh, oh!\nOh, oh!\n\n[Verse 1]\nDrowning deep in my sea of loathing\nBroken, your servant, I kneel (Will you give in to me?)\nIt seems what's left of my human side\nIs slowly changing in me (Will you give in to me?)\n\nLooking at my own reflection\nWhen suddenly it changes, violently it changes\nOh no, there is no turning back now\nYou've woken up the demon in me\n\n[Chorus]\nGet up, come on, get down with the sickness\nGet up, come on, get down with the sickness\nGet up, come on, get down with the sickness\nOpen up your hate and let it flow into me\n\nGet up, come on, get down with the sickness\nYou mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness\nYou fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness\nMadness is the gift that has been given to me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI can see inside you, the sickness is rising\nDon't try to deny what you feel (Will you give in to me?)\nIt seems that all that was good has died\nAnd is decaying in me (Will you give in to me?)\n\nIt seems you're having some trouble\nIn dealing with these changes, living with these changes\nOh no, the world is a scary place\nNow that you've woken up the demon in me\n\n[Chorus]\nGet up, come on, get down with the sickness\nGet up, come on, get down with the sickness\nGet up, come on, get down with the sickness\nOpen up your hate and let it flow into me\n\nGet up, come on, get down with the sickness\nYou mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness\nYou fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness\nMadness is the gift that has been given to me\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd when I dream\nAnd when I dream\n\nAlbum version only:\n\nAnd when I dream\nAnd when I dream\n\n[Spoken]\nNo, mommy, don't do it again!\nDon't do it again, I'll be a good boy!\nI'll be a good boy, I promise!\nNo, mommy, don't hit me!\nWhy did you have to hit me like that, mommy?\nDon't do it, you're hurting me!\nWhy did you have to be such a bitch?\nWhy don't you? Why don't you just fuck off and die?\nWhy can't you just fuck off and die?\nWhy can't you just leave here and die?\nNever stick your hand in my face again, bitch!\nFuck you! I don't need this shit!\nYou stupid, sadistic, abusive, fucking whore!\nHow would you like to see how it feels, mommy?\nHere it comes, get ready to die!\n\nRadio, video & album version:\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, wah-ah-ah-ah!\n\nGet up, come on, get down with the sickness\nGet up, come on, get down with the sickness\nGet up, come on, get down with the sickness\nOpen up your hate, and let it flow into me\n\nGet up, come on get down with the sickness\nYou mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness\nYou fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness\nMadness has now come over me\n\n", "author": "Disturbed"}
