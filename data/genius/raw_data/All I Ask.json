{"title": "All I Ask", "type": "lyrics", "content": "I will leave my heart at the door\nI won't say a word\nThey've all been said before, you know\nSo why don't we just play pretend\nLike we're not scared of what is coming next\nOr scared of having nothing left?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLook, don't get me wrong\nI know there is no tomorrow\nAll I ask is\n\n[Chorus]\nIf this is my last night with you\nHold me like I'm more than just a friend\nGive me a memory I can use\nTake me by the hand while we do\nWhat lovers do\nIt matters how this ends\n'Cause what if I never love again?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI don't need your honesty\nIt's already in your eyes\nAnd I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me\nNo one knows me like you do\nAnd since you're the only one that mattered\nTell me, who do I run to?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLook, don't get me wrong\nI know there is no tomorrow\nAll I ask is\n\n[Chorus]\nIf this is my last night with you\nHold me like I'm more than just a friend\nGive me a memory I can use\nTake me by the hand while we do\nWhat lovers do\nIt matters how this ends\n'Cause what if I never love again?\n\n[Bridge]\nLet this be our lesson in love\nLet this be the way we remember us\nI don't want to be cruel or vicious\nAnd I ain't asking for forgiveness\nAll I ask is\n\n[Chorus]\nIf this is my last night with you\nHold me like I'm more than just a friend\nGive me a memory I can use\nTake me by the hand while we do\nWhat lovers do\nIt matters how this ends\n'Cause what if I never love again?\n\n", "author": "Adele"}
