Yeah\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou fix your make up, just so\nGuess you don't know, that you're beautiful\nTry on every dress that you own\nYou were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago\n\n[Pre hook]\nAnd if your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll\nBe the one to let you know\n\n[Hook]\nOut of all the girls\nYou my one and only girl\nAin't nobody in the world tonight\n\nAll of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours\nAin't nobody in the world but you and I\nYou and I\nAin't nobody in the world but you and I\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou stop the room when we walk in\nSpotlights on everybody staring\nTell all of these boys, they wasting their time\nStop standing in line, cause you're all mine\n\n[Pre hook]\nAnd this evening I, won't let the feeling die\nI never wanna leave your side\n\n[Hook]\nOut of all the girls\nYou my one and only girl\nAin't nobody in the world tonight\n\n[Bridge]\nYou keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting\nYou don't even have to try\n\nYou don't have to try\nDon't try\nDon't try\nYou don't have to try\n\n[Hook]\nOut of all the girls\nYou my one and only girl\nAin't nobody in the world tonight\n\n", "author": "John Legend"}
