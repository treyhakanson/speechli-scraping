{"title": "Clarity", "type": "lyrics", "content": "\n[Verse 1: Foxes]\nHigh dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life\nFight fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time\nHold still right before we crash cause we both know how this ends\nOur clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass and I drown in you again\n\n[Chorus: Foxes]\nCause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need\nChasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why\nIf our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?\nIf our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?\n\n[Bridge: Foxes]\nIf our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?\nIf our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?\n\n[Verse 2: Foxes]\nWalk on through a red parade and refuse to make amends\nIt cuts deep through our ground and makes us forget all common sense\nDon't speak as I try to leave cause we both know what we'll choose\nIf you pull, then I'll push too deep and I'll fall right back to you\n\n[Chorus: Foxes]\nCause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need\nChasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why\nIf our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?\nIf our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?\n\n[Interlude: Foxes]\nWhy are you my clarity?\nWhy are you my remedy?\nWhy are you my clarity?\nWhy are you my remedy?\n\n[Bridge: Foxes]\nIf our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?\nIf our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?\n\n", "author": "Zedd"}
