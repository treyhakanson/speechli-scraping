(time for you)\nAnd this little song of mine\nCan I sing it one time for you?\nAnd it goes like\nOoooooooooh\nAll I want is you\n\n[Chorus:]\nLet me sing to you\nLift you up when you were done\nLet me sing to you\nWhen there's no one left around\nLet my voice just take control\nI can feel it in my soul\nWhen I sing to you\nJust let me sing to you\nAll you gotta do is listen\n\n[Verse 2:]\nWhen the days seem longer\nAnd your dreams seem far away\nA little note makes it all okay\n\n[Pre Chorus:]\nSo yes I have a melody line\nCan I sing it one time for you? (time for you)\nAnd this little song of mine\nCan I sing it one time for you?\nAnd it goes like\nOoooooooooh\nAll I want is you\n\n[Chorus:]\nLet me sing to you\nLift you up when you were done\nLet me sing to you\nWhen there's no one left around\nLet my voice just take control\nI can feel it in my soul\nWhen I sing to you\nJust let me sing to you\n\n[Bridge:]\nI lend a symphony, or [??]\nI'll conduct the melody\nI'll be your guide, open your eyes and let me in\nI'll sing to you, just listen\n\n[Chorus:]\nLet me sing to you\nLift you up when you were done\nLet me sing to you\nWhen there's no one left around\nLet my voice just take control\nI can feel it in my soul\nWhen I sing to you\nJust let me sing to you\nAll you gotta do is listen\n\n", "author": "Normani"}
