{"title": "Rainbow", "type": "lyrics", "content": "When it rains, it pours\nBut you didn't even notice\nIt ain't rainin' anymore\nIt's hard to breathe when all you know is\nThe struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line\n\n[Chorus]\nWell the sky has finally opened\nThe rain and wind stopped blowin'\nBut you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again\nYou hold tight to your umbrella\nWell, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya\nThat there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf you could see what I see\nYou'd be blinded by the colors\nYellow, red, and orange, and green\nAnd at least a million others\nSo tie up the boat, take off your coat, and take a look around\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause the sky has finally opened\nThe rain and wind stopped blowin'\nBut you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again\nYou hold tight to your umbrella\nWell, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya\nThat there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, tie up the boat, take off your coat, and take a look around\nEverything is alright now\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause the sky has finally opened\nThe rain and wind stopped blowin'\nBut you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again\nLet go of your umbrella\n'Cause, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya\nThat there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head\nYeah, there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head\n\n[Outro]\nIt'll all be alright\n\n", "author": "Kacey Musgraves"}
