Hey, heartless is recklessness, it's\nWord of a pacifist to war of a masochist, I'm\nOff of the map, my Lord, I spoke to a Baphomet, he\nSaid he would save me if I gave him one thing he needed\n\"What is this thing?\", I pleaded; boy, it's the key to even, yeah\n\n[Outro]\nAnd as I spoke, my fangs were shown\nTaken aback, he smiles and tells me\n\"What you crave will soon be yours\nBut what I crave is already mine\"\nAnima vestra\nAnima\nAnima vestra\nAnima\n\n", "author": "XXXTENTACION"}
