{"title": "Selfish", "type": "lyrics", "content": "I'm a bad man\nJames Dean, kinda Steve McQueen\nStraight out the badlands\nI rolled in and rained down\nLike a storm cloud or a heat wave\nMade you stay undercover where it's safe\nDon't give a damn about the plans you made\nWe're staying in the bed all day\n\n[Chorus]\nCause I'm selfish\nRestless like a river, can't help it\nI'm taking what you give me but I still want more\nI still want more\nCause I'm selfish\nYeah I'm selfish, I'm selfish for you\n\n[Verse 2]\nHave you seen yourself in a full-length mirror\nSpinning around lately\nI'd lie, cheat, and steal\nFeel the sweet scent overtake me\nBut the Lord sent an angel to save me\nSo he can't blame me\nWhen my hands get a mind of their own\nGirl, if they get ahold of you, I ain't never letting go\n\n[Chorus]\nCause I'm selfish\nRestless like a river, can't help it\nI'm taking what you give me but I still want more\nI still want more\nCause I'm selfish\nYeah I'm selfish, I'm selfish for you\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, so selfish for you\nI still want more\nI still want more\nI still want more\nI still want more\n\n[Chorus]\nCause I'm selfish\nRestless like a river, can't help it\nI'm taking what you give me but I still want more\nI still want more\nCause I'm selfish\nYeah I'm selfish, I'm selfish for you\n\n[Outro]\nStill want more\nI still want more\nI still want more\nI still want more\nI'm selfish for you\n\n", "author": "Jordan Davis"}
