{"title": "Dive", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Oh, maybe I came on too strong\nMaybe I waited too long\nMaybe I played my cards wrong\nOh, just a little bit wrong\nBaby I apologize for it\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI could fall, or I could fly\nHere in your aeroplane\nAnd I could live, I could die\nHanging on the words you say\nAnd I've been known to give my all\nAnd jumping in harder than\nTen thousand rocks on the lake\n\n[Chorus]\nSo don't call me baby\nUnless you mean it\nAnd don't tell me you need me\nIf you don't believe it\nSo let me know the truth\nBefore I dive right into you\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're a mystery\nI've travelled the world\nAnd there's no other girl like you\nNo one, what's your history? (What's your history?)\nDo you have a tendency to lead some people on?\n'Cause I heard you do, mmm\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI could fall, or I could fly\nHere in your aeroplane\nAnd I could live, I could die\nHanging on the words you say\nAnd I've been known to give my all\nAnd lie awake, every day\nDon't know how much I can take\n\n[Chorus]\nSo don't call me baby\nUnless you mean it\nDon't tell me you need me\nIf you don't believe it\nSo let me know the truth\nBefore I dive right into you\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI could fall, or I could fly\nHere in your aeroplane\nAnd I could live, I could die\nHanging on the words you say\nAnd I've been known to give my all\nSitting back, looking at\nEvery mess that I made\n\n[Chorus]\nSo don't call me baby\nUnless you mean it\nDon't tell me you need me\nIf you don't believe it\nLet me know the truth\nBefore I dive right into you\nBefore I dive right into you\nBefore I dive right into you\n\n", "author": "Ed Sheeran"}
