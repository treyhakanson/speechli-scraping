Who\u2019s wrong?\nWho really cares?\nThe fault, the blame, the pain\u2019s still there\nI'm here alone inside of this broken home, this broken home\n\n[Verse 2: Calum]\nWrote it down on the walls, she was screaming it out\nMade it clear she\u2019s still here, are you listening now?\nJust a ghost in the halls\nFeeling empty, they\u2019re vacant now\nAll the battles, all the wars, all the times that you\u2019ve fought\nShe\u2019s a scar, she\u2019s the bruises, she\u2019s the pain that you brought\nThere was life, there was love\nLike a light and it\u2019s fading out\n\n[Chorus: Luke]\nHey, mom, hey, dad\nWhen did this end?\nWhen did you lose your happiness?\nI'm here alone inside of this broken home\nWho\u2019s right? Who\u2019s wrong?\nWho really cares?\nThe fault, the blame, the pain\u2019s still there\nI'm here alone inside of this broken home, this broken home\n\n[Bridge: Michael]\nYou've gotta let it go\nYou\u2019re losing all your hope\nNothing left to hold\nLocked out in the cold\nYour pain and memories\nThey washed out all the scenes\nI'm stuck in between\nA nightmare and lost dreams\n\n[Chorus: Michael & All & Calum]\nHey, mom, hey, dad\nWhen did this end?\nWhen did you lose your happiness?\nI'm here alone inside of this broken home\nHey, mom, hey, dad\nWhen did this end?\nWhen did you lose your happiness?\nI'm here alone inside of this broken home\nWho\u2019s right? Who\u2019s wrong?\nWho really cares?\nThe fault, the blame, the pain\u2019s still there\nI'm here alone inside of this broken home\nThis broken home\n\n", "author": "5 Seconds of Summer"}
