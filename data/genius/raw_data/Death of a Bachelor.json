Letting the water fall\nThe death of a bachelor\nO-o-oh! Seems so fitting for\nHappily ever after, whooo\nHow could I ask for more?\nA lifetime of laughter\nAt the expense of the death of a bachelor\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm cutting my mind off\nFeels like my heart is going to burst\nAlone at a table for two\nAnd I just wanna be served\nAnd when you think of me\nAm I the best you've ever had?\nShare one more drink with me\nSmile even though you're sad\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm walking the long road\nWatching the sky fall\nThe lace in your dress tingles my neck\nHow do I live?\n\n[Chorus]\nThe death of a bachelor\nO-o-oh! Letting the water fall\nThe death of a bachelor\nO-o-oh! Seems so fitting for\nHappily ever after, whooo\nHow could I ask for more?\nA lifetime of laughter\nAt the expense of the death of a bachelor\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Chorus]\nThe death of a bachelor\nO-o-oh! Letting the water fall\nThe death of a bachelor\nO-o-oh! Seems so fitting for\nHappily ever after, whooo\nHow could I ask for more?\nA lifetime of laughter\nAt the expense of the death of a bachelor\n\n", "author": "Panic! at the Disco"}
