Cole]\nOkay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib\nOr even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib\nPaying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well-spent\nNo heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?\nHad a thing for ya, even wrote the song \"Dreams\" for ya\n\u2018Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya\nChildish shit, you know childish shit\nAnonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit\nNow a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip\nBack home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh\nThe same clubs that I used to get tossed out\nLife got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out\n\u2018Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out\nOld chicks crying \u2018cause they know that they lost out\nBut I'm still on you, I'm still on you\nMy drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'\u2014\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]\nWould you believe me if I said I'm in love?\nBaby, I want you to want me\nWould you believe me if I said I'm in love?\nBaby, I want ya\n\n[Chorus 2: J. Cole]\nAnd we are, we are, we are\nGot me up all night\nAnd we are, we are, we are\nAll I'm singin' is love songs\nAnd we are, we are, we are\nGot me up all night\nAnd we are, we are, we are (She got me)\nAnd we are, we are, we are (She got me)\n\n[Verse 2: J. Cole]\nWell, this has got to be the longest crush ever\nIf I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever\nLove is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and\nFuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?\nShe on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga\nWife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga\nLike, \"Give me 20 dollars, dollars!\"\nAss stupid, how you get to college, college?\nI'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now\nWent and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now\nCan't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, clich\u00e9\nI used to pop up on you at the mall each day\nNow, typically I kick game like East Bay\nBut you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: \"Please play!\"\nFor Pete's sake, homie, pull it together\nJust fuck her one time and be through with forever, but\u2014\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]\nWould you believe me if I said I'm in love?\nBaby, I want you to want me\nWould you believe me if I said I'm in love?\nBaby, I want ya, yeah\n\n[Chorus 2: J. Cole]\nAnd we are, we are, we are\nGot me up all night\nAnd we are, we are, we are\nAll I'm singin' is love songs\nAnd we are, we are, we are\nGot me up all night\nAnd we are, we are, we are (She got me)\nAnd we are, we are, we are (She got me)\n\n[Chorus 1: J. Cole]\nGot me up all night (All night)\nAll I'm singin' is love songs\nShe got me up all night (All night)\nConstant drinkin' and love songs\nShe got me up all night (All night)\nDown-and-out with these love songs\nShe got me up all night (All night)\nDrownin' out with these love songs\nShe got me up all night (Yeah)\nAll I'm singin' is love songs\nShe got me up all night (Yeah)\nConstant drinkin' and love songs\nShe got me up all night (Yeah)\nDown-and-out with these love songs\nShe got me open all night (Uh-huh)\nGot me open all night, hey\n\n[Outro: J.
