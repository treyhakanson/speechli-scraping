{"title": "COPYCAT", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Don't be cautious, don't be kind\nYou committed, I'm your crime\nPush my button anytime\nYou got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine\n\n[Verse 2]\nSilver dollar, golden flame\nDirty water, poison rain\nPerfect murder, take your aim\nI don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBy the way, you've been uninvited\n'Cause all you say are all the same things I did\n\n[Chorus]\nCopycat tryna cop my manner\nWatch your back when you can't watch mine\nCopycat tryna cop my glamor\nWhy so sad, bunny? Can't have mine\n\n[Verse 3]\nCall me calloused, call me cold\nYou're italic, I'm in bold\nCall me cocky, watch your tone\nYou better love me, 'cause you're just a clone\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBy the way, you've been uninvited\n'Cause all you say are all the same things I did\n\n[Chorus]\nCopycat tryna cop my manner\nWatch your back when you can't watch mine\nCopycat tryna cop my glamor\nWhy so sad, bunny? Can't have mine\n\n[Bridge]\nMine\nI would hate to see you go\nHate to be the one that told you so\nYou just crossed the line\nYou've run out of time\nI'm so sorry, now you know\nSorry I'm the one that told you so\nSorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry\nPsych\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBy the way, you've been uninvited\n'Cause all you say are all the same things I did\n\n[Chorus]\nCopycat tryna cop my manner\nWatch your back when you can't watch mine\nCopycat tryna cop my glamor\nWhy so sad, bunny? Can't have mine\n\n", "author": "Billie Eilish"}
