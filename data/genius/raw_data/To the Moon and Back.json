{"title": "To the Moon and Back", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Through the dirt and the gravel\nThrough the years and the miles\nEvery road that you traveled\nThrough the tears and the smiles\nThrough the clear and the muddy\nThrough the thick and thin\nThe quiet nights, the howling wind\nThrough the good and the ugly\nThe blue and the black\nTo the ends of the Earth\nTo the moon and back\n\n[Verse 2]\nThrough all of the words\nThe mean and the kind\nThrough the strings that unravel\nAnd the ties that bind\nFrom the crazy and the different\nTo the more of the same\nFrom the coast is clear\nTo a hurricane\nYeah, I'll be right beside you\nOn a roll or off the tracks\nTo the ends of the Earth\nTo the moon and back\nTo the moon and back\n\n[Verse 3]\nThrough the bitter and the sweet\nThe cold and the fire\nLonely cotton sheets\nAnd the burning desire\nUntil our song is over\nTil the stars all fade to black\nI'm gonna love you\nTo the ends of the Earth\nTo the moon and back\nYeah, I'm gonna love you\nAll the way to the moon and back\nTo the moon and back\n\n", "author": "Luke Bryan"}
