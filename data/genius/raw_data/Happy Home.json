{"title": "Happy Home", "type": "lyrics", "content": "Mama called about the paper turns out they wrote about me\nNow my broken heart\u00b4s the only thing that's broke about me\nSo many people should have seen what we got going on\nI only wanna put my heart and my life in songs\nWriting about the pain I felt with my daddy gone\nAbout the emptiness I felt when I sat alone\nAbout the happiness I feel when I sing it loud\nHe should have heard the noise we made with the happy crowd\nDid my grandaddy know he taught me what a poem was\nHow you can use a sentence or just a simple pause\nWhat will I say when my kids ask me who my daddy was\nI thought about it for a while and I'm at a loss\nKnowing that I'm gonna live my whole life without him\nI found out a lot of things I never knew about him\nAll I know is that I'll never really be alone\nCause we gotta lot of love and a happy home\n\n[Verse 2]\nMagazines are writing stuff but I don\u00b4t ever read them\nSome of the folks I used to know would see and start believing\nThat I would pass them by on streets and never reach to greet them\nI still remember folks even though I rarely meet them\nDon\u00b4t you know I miss the times when we used to hang\nBefore twenty deep depended on a single man\nBefore a single heart was broken by a single blow\nBefore all our careers depended on a single show\nI grew up with a lot of love in a happy home\nNow I got a lot of cash and I'm on a road\nI realize privacy\u00b4s becoming difficult\nIt\u00b4s all right now but what about when I\u00b4m old\nI know my good friends now they\u00b4ll last\nThe same ones that stood by me when my daddy passed\nAll I know is that we\u00b4ll never really be alone\nCause we got a lot of love and a happy home\n\n[Verse 3]\nI write a lot of songs will anybody ever read them\nYou hear them on the radio but will you really read them\nWhy do we have our idols and why do we wanna be them\nAfter we see them on TV we really wanna meet them\nDon\u00b4t you think they miss the time when they used to hang\nBefore a fan base depended on a single man\nBefore a single heart was broken by a single show\nWho\u00b4s gonna stand who\u00b4s gonna fall I really wanna know\nI grew up with a lot of love in a happy home\nMy daddy use to play me vinyl but now daddy\u00b4s gone\nI used to practice with my mommy on the piano\nI still get nervous every time I know she\u00b4s at a show\nNow my family comes first before everyone\nI had the perfect dad I wanna be the perfect son\nThough I really feel sometimes I am on my own\nI know I got a lot of love and a happy home\n\n", "author": "Hedegaard"}
