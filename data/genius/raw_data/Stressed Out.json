{"title": "Stressed Out", "type": "lyrics", "content": "I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard\nI wish I had a better voice that sang some better words\nI wish I found some chords in an order that is new\nI wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang\nI was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink\nBut now I'm insecure, and I care what people think\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMy name's Blurryface and I care what you think\nMy name's Blurryface and I care what you think\n\n[Chorus]\nWish we could turn back time to the good old days\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out\nWish we could turn back time to the good old days\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out\nWe're stressed out\n\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young\nHow come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?\nI'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it\nTry to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one\nIt'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose\nSame clothes, home grown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam\nBut it would remind us of when nothing really mattered\nOut of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMy name's Blurryface and I care what you think\nMy name's Blurryface and I care what you think\n\n[Chorus]\nWish we could turn back time to the good old days\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out\nWish we could turn back time to the good old days\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out\n\n[Bridge]\nUsed to play pretend, give each other different names\nWe would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away\nUsed to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face\nSayin', \"wake up, you need to make money!\", yeah\nUsed to play pretend, give each other different names\nWe would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away\nUsed to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face\nSayin', \"wake up, you need to make money!\", yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nWish we could turn back time to the good old days\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out\nWish we could turn back time to the good old days\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out\n\n[Outro]\nWe used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny\nWe used to play pretend, wake up you need the money\nUsed to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny\nWe used to play pretend, wake up you need the money\nUsed to play pretend, give each other different names\nWe would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away\nUsed to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face\nSayin', \"wake up, you need to make money!\", yeah\n\n", "author": "\u200btwenty one pilots"}
