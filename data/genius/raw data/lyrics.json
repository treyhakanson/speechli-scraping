the cinema\nWhatever happened to the values of humanity?\nWhatever happened to the fairness and equality?\nInstead of spreadin' love we spreadin' animosity\nLack of understandin' leading us away from unity\nThat's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under\nThat's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down\nIt's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under\nGotta keep my faith alive 'til love is

and a happy home\n\n[Verse 3]\nI write a lot of songs will anybody ever read them\nYou hear them on the radio but will you really read them\nWhy do we have our idols and why do we wanna be them\nAfter we see them on TV we really wanna meet them\nDon\u00b4t you think they miss the time when they used to hang\nBefore a fan base depended on a single man\nBefore a single heart was broken by a single show\nWho\u00b4s gonna stand who\u00b4s gonna fall I really wanna know\nI grew up with a lot of love in a happy home\nMy daddy use to play me vinyl but now daddy\u00b4s gone\nI used to practice with my mommy on the piano\nI still get nervous every time I know she\u00b4s at a show\nNow my family comes first before everyone\nI had the perfect dad I wanna be the perfect son\nThough I really feel sometimes I am on my own\nI know I got a lot of love and a happy home\n\n"}, {"title": "Holder Fast", "artist": "Hennedub", "type": "lyrics", "content": "(\u00c5\u00e5h-\u00e5h-\u00e5h,
