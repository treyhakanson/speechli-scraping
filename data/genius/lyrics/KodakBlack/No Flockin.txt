Artist: Kodak Black

[Intro]
Damn, that's so sad
K-K-K, K-K-K

[Verse]
Young nigga, I got old cash, spazzin' on they ass
I got Prada on my hoe ass, got my last one mad
Pop a nigga like a damn tag, shoppin' on they ass
I just bought a new old Jag, yeah, it's so fast
Smokin' flocka, you a jackass, all I smoke is gas
Don't you ask me where the pole at, where yo clothes at?
I ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, dammit, but y'all trippin', too
Is it you? Damn, my nigga, what the hell got into you?
Project baby, y'all was skippin' in the hallway, I was skippin' school
On my Ps and Qs, on them jiggas, call me jiggaboo
Bleedin' concrete, bet you niggas won't come 'cross the street
Pardon me, Ion't talk to you so don't you talk to me
I ain't dissin' on nobody, B, I'm vibin' on the beat
Honestly, I'm just tryna be, I just gotta be
Tryin' to get over on anything, they tellin' lies to me
I spent five on my pinky ring, she love my diamond ring
Anyway, I'm married to the game, she said her vows to me
I ain't gettin' on my knees, bae, you bow down to me
You go down for me, you lay down and do the time for me
Sorry, boo, yeah, I lied to you, but don't you lie to me
It's Lil Kodak, the finesse kid, boy, who hot as me?
Told the doctor I'm a healthy kid, I smoke broccoli
I will run around your whole board like Monopoly
Ol' boy, you's a broke boy, flocka's got you beat
Chocolate, call me Reese's, can't catch me without the piece
C'est la vie, I'm ten toes down, you fallin' off your feet
I will trick yo ass for a treat, call it Halloween
Yeah, that money's what I play fo', call it lottery
Goddamn, you's a clown to me, you's a clown to me
You can't smoke no Black & Milds with me, get in the car with me
You a funny guy, don't you even joke around with me
How could it be? Get from 'round a G, you grounded from me
I'm a freeband junkie, you a junkie
You gettin' skinny, I'm gettin' chunky, gettin' money
Want some food? Boy, you hungry, I want them hundreds
Hundreds
