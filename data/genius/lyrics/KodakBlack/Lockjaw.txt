Title: Lockjaw
Artist: French Montana

[Intro: French Montana]
My nigga, my nigga
You never told me
Montana

[Hook: Kodak Black and French Montana]
It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
And I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me, my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'

[Verse 1: Kodak Black & French Montana]
I chew your lil' mup, I'll boot a nigga up
Got them snipers in the dually truck and we toolie'd up
I be tryna change my life, but a monkey on my back
I've been rollin' all night, I got a monkey on my back
(Skrrr, skrrr) All about the mula
Throw a hundred chains on, tryna cool off
I know a nigga blessed, pray to God
Soon as the floor hits my feet I'm getting high
Eyes bowleg, lookin' crooked in the face
She keep lookin' in her drink, probably think the liquor laced
Nah bitch, I'm 1K (And I'ma keep it one hundo)
Bitin' down, 'bout to rip my tongue off

[Hook: Kodak Black and French Montana]
It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
And I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me, my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'

[Verse 2: Kodak Black & French Montana]
Slidin' in the Cutlass and you know I paint it candy
Then I pulled up in a bucket, but I used to want a Hemi
And I'm pourin' up the round then I'm sippin' on Remy
I ain't fuckin with that white shit, I'm throwed off Henny
Pull up to the back, black Zac, chief rockin'
And the Feds keep lurkin' 'cause the boys keep talkin'
Ritz Carlton, ran off on the plug about forty times
Forty niggas strapped, we the '49ers
Bite down, Karlton Hines
Got two twin bitches doin' 69
Jump off to the mula and you know that
50 chains on, diamonds flashin' like Kodak
I remember totin' .38, now I got a semi
Could have been had a baby K, but I wasn't ready
Shawty say she like my Larry Pack, thought I went to Kelly
Nah baby I ain't want no Wap, I just want the Fetty

[Hook: Kodak Black and French Montana]
It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
And I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me, my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'

[Outro: Kodak Black &  French Montana]
Ay, ay ay
Ay, ay ay ay
Skrr, ay, ay ay ay
Ay, ay ay
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Ay, ay ay ay
