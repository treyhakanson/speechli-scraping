Title: Say Something
Artist: Justin Timberlake

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Mhmm, yeah, alright
Ooh

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Everybody says, "say something that says something”
“Say something that says something”
“Say something that says something”
I don't wanna get caught, up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have

[Verse 2: Chris Stapleton & Justin Timberlake]
Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere, there's melody and harmony
For you and me, tonight (whoa)
I hear them call my name

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Justin Timberlake]
Everybody says, "Say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something"
I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't get help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing

[Part-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)

[Outro: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing
