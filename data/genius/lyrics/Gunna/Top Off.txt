Title: Top Off
Artist: Gunna

[Intro]
Yeah my nigga, we
We really poppin' this shit for real nigga, yeah
No cap, no rap cap (yeah)

[Chorus]
I took the top off, I'm dripping like hot sauce
I got drank and it's clean raw
Baby give me that mean mouth
Hit that pussy like golf ball
I can do this without y'all
Caught a loss, I go loco
I go back to the traphouse
Break the bricks and the bales down
Cashing in and I cash out
Turn that shit to a stash house
I ain't taking no handouts
Money calling, I'm en route
Fuck them niggas they been down
Blow a bag when I'm in town

[Verse 1]
They say Gunna you the best, I done went and got a check
I'm about to flex, it's an Audemars Piguet
Rocking diamonds, I'm wet
I got water 'round my neck, I done start to worry less
Went and bought my bitch a Lexus, Hi-Tech my fresh
Niggas sending me threats, I done bought another vest
I'm protecting my flesh, nigga pardon my bad
Fendi fur on my hat, I don't hang wit' no rats
I could never get attached

[Pre-Chorus]
Got Chanel, I can see now, I got back on my feet now
I can take care my team now, I'ma hold my whole team down
Niggas hate, I don't see how, made it out of the damn South
And I don't even know how
'Bout to pull me a Benz out

[Chorus]
I took the top off, I'm dripping like hot sauce
I got drank and it's clean raw
Baby give me that mean mouth
Hit that pussy like golf ball
I can do this without y'all
Call the Locs, I go loco
I go back to the traphouse
Break the bricks and the bales down
Cashing in and I cash out
Turn that shit to a stash house
I ain't taking no handouts
Money calling, I'm en route
Fuck them niggas they been down
Blow a bag when I'm in town

[Verse 2]
Yeah I drip when I'm in town, I'm just tryna stay in bounds
Ain't no milk I'm a cash cow, Gunna came with his own sound
You ain't stealing his flow now, blowin' smoke and it's so loud
I been bringing these hoes out, Gunna get in his zone now
Eat the greens, salad, yeah, nigga still rappin'
Racks got me relaxin', bought me a gold Patek
Yeah I'm fly and I'm flashy, yeah, nigga we havin'
Tell me your profession, we gang banging active
YSL legends

[Pre-Chorus]
Got Chanel, I can see now, I got back on my feet now
I can take care my team now, I'ma hold my whole team down
Niggas hate, I don't see how, made it out of the damn South
And I don't even know how
'Bout to pull me a Benz out

[Chorus]
I took the top off, I'm dripping like hot sauce
I got drank and it's clean raw
Baby give me that mean mouth
Hit that pussy like golf ball
I can do this without y'all
Call the Locs, I go loco
I go back to the traphouse
Break the bricks and the bales down
Cashing in and I cash out
Turn that shit to a stash house
I ain't taking no handouts
Money calling, I'm en route
Fuck them niggas they been down
Blow a bag when I'm in town
