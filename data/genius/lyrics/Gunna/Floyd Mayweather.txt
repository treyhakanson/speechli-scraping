I'm sellin' purple rain, RIP to Prince
When I was behind the fence they treated me like a prince
So much jewelry on, her pussy gettin' tense
1017's the ones you don't wanna diss
And you can never be like 'Wop you little snitch
You make me mad, I have a threesome with your bitch
I'm from Custer East Atlanta, yeah the 6
I make one brick turn to two, I know a trick
The walking lick, my chopper is my walkin' stick

Dynamite no whine up
Have you fly from India, have you fly from China
I won't feel you honestly, strap up 49er
Pew-pew-pew, pew-pew-pew

[Hook 3: Gunna and Young Thug]
I'm in Vegas spendin' thousands on my chips
I can't love these bitches, fell in love the rip
I was doin' this shit just for my peers
I would put inside my blood, my sweat, my tears
Do this shit all on my own, don't need no deal
Diamonds flawless 'round my neck, gave me a chill
Lately I've been flyin' on them Lears
Flyin' cross the world, these bitches killin' me

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
Flood her bank account with bands cause she feelin' me
Nigga cash on delivery
If it's a snake on my clothes then it's double G
I don't like police hoes, ain't no cuffin' me
All my diamonds dancin' like they Bruce Lee
Check out my smile I got some new teeth
Pop a molly now I'm in the fuckin' air
Cloud nine and I'm smokin' like the fuckin' bear

[Verse 5: Gunna]
We at the Clearport, you niggas never there
I wouldnâ€™t even cap lil bitch this our year
I do it for my fam, 20 racks on gifts
Bitch we blowin' gas, roll me up a spliff
Now what you think a young nigga grindin' for?
I sip it till I sleep, I might overdose
She made it out the hood and left that dope bowl
Get them bricks from my momma, she got truck loads

[Verse 6: Young Thug + Gunna]
Fuck you mean you get it from your mammy hoe? Yeah
Diamonds all on my chin, diamonds all on my folk
Piercin' in my nose, diamond in my nose
Giuseppe open toes, diamonds on my toes
I just got a family pack of Jimmy Choos, damn
I just bought a chopper and I'm ready to use it, damn
I got a lot of bitches comin' by the twos
I got a lot of bitches, bomin' by the few

[Hook 4: Gunna]
Big di-diamonds but we call 'em jewels
All these racks think I sell dog foods
I spend thousand on my fuckin' shoes
Pull up in this Ave, it cost the Christian Loubes
Nigga watch your mouth, we ain't fuckin' cool
YSL the mafia, that's a fuckin' fool
Take this shit out and shoot
