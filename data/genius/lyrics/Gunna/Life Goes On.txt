[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Trackhawk Jeep goes too fast (too fast)
I don't even wear no seatbelt (seatbelt)
Bad lil' bitch got no breasts (no breasts)
Upgrade, now she got D-cups (D-cups)
Hop out the Range, I'm glo'in' (glo'in')
Who is Lil Baby? He goin' in (goin' in)
Man these old rappers gettin' borin' (borin')
They be takin' shots, I ignore them (ignore them)
Send them packs to the hood while I'm tourin' (tourin')
Makin' plays out of town like I'm Jordan (scorin')
Need to go get your ho 'cause she whorin' (scorin')
If her ball come my way I'ma score it (scorin')
Lamborghini, I don't want no Porsches (Porsches)
I'm on fire, don't touch me, I'm scorchin' (torchin')
Had to fix all my teeth, I went porcelain (porcelain)
Put the town on my back, I'm a horseman (horseman)
One more year, I'ma make it to Forbes' List (Forbes' List)
They love me in the Bay like E-40 (40)
I be sittin' exotic on Moreland (Moreland)
Ain't no strings attached, keepin' it cordless (cordless)
She keep callin', but I keep ignorin' it
Ain't no stoppin', I'm keepin' it floorin' it
Man these niggas can't stop me, I'm goin' in
Man these niggas can't stop me, I'm goin' in

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Every time the pack get gone, I get another load ('nother load)
My main bitch tryna leave me 'lone 'cause I fucked another ho ('nother ho)
I'm like, "Baby, I know I'm wrong, but this just how life goes (how life goes)
And I know these niggas'd be happy if I let you go (oh no, no)"
Got me walkin' on a thin line, on my tippy toes (tippy toes)
Man this shit crazy, different city with some different hoes, here we go
Every time the pack get gone, I get another load ('nother load)
My main bitch tryna leave me 'lone 'cause I fucked another ho ('nother ho)
I'm like, "Baby, I know I'm wrong, but this just how life goes (how life goes)
And I know these niggas'd be happy if I let you go (let you go)"
Got me walkin' on a thin line, on my tippy toes (tippy toes)
Man this shit crazy, different city with some different hoes, here we go

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Tryna spend a whole M on some clothes (clothes)
Got a bonus, I sold out a show (show)
Gunna hot like a pot on the stove
Yellow AP on all of my hoes (hoes)
I like when that white on her toes
Picture me ridin' around in that Rolls
I put some ice on my wrist, it was swole
I ain't got time to lay up with you hoes (hoes)
All of these drugs in my body
I gotta pay somebody keep checkin' my pulse
Walk in the club with no warning take care of that money
They swing on the pole (pole)
Water on me like Dasani
I shine when it's sunny, this platinum and rose
Gunna Gunna out the streets
When I go to DC I'ma fuck with Lil Mo

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Every time the pack get gone, I get another load ('nother load)
My main bitch tryna leave me 'lone 'cause I fucked another ho ('nother ho)
I'm like, "Baby, I know I'm wrong, but this just how life goes (how life goes)
And I know these niggas'd be happy if I let you go (oh no, no)"
Got me walkin' on a thin line, on my tippy toes (tippy toes)
Man this shit crazy, different city with some different hoes, here we go
Every time the pack get gone, I get another load ('nother load)
My main bitch tryna leave me 'lone 'cause I fucked another ho ('nother ho)
I'm like, "Baby, I know I'm wrong, but this just how life goes (how life goes)
And I know these niggas'd be happy if I let you go (let you go)"
Got me walkin' on a thin line, on my tippy toes (tippy toes)
Man this shit crazy, different city with some different hoes, here we go

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
Man this shit crazy, different city with some different hoes (yeah)
I can switch my girls up the same way that I change my clothes (okay)
Man it's crazy, all blue backend in the envelope (let's get it)
And you know I'm never lackin', gotta new whip that's up in traffic
Water, water, water on my Patek (woah), it's automatic
I drink water when I'm fastin' (water), you's a has-been
They would love me in a casket, I can't have it
Boy I'm far from average, better wait your turn, better get in line

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Every time the pack get gone, I get another load ('nother load)
My main bitch tryna leave me 'lone 'cause I fucked another ho ('nother ho)
I'm like, "Baby, I know I'm wrong, but this just how life goes (how life goes)
And I know these niggas'd be happy if I let you go (oh no, no)"
Got me walkin' on a thin line, on my tippy toes (tippy toes)
Man this shit crazy, different city with some different hoes, here we go
Every time the pack get gone, I get another load ('nother load)

[Post-Hook: Gunna]
Tryna spend a whole M on some clothes (clothes)
Got a bonus, I sold out a show (show)
Gunna hot like a pot on the stove
Yellow AP on all of my hoes (hoes)
I like when that white on her toes
Picture me ridin' around in that Rolls
I put some ice on my wrist, it was swole
Still ain't got time to lay up with you hoes (hoes)
