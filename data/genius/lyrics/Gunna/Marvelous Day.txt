[Intro: Gunna & Kap G]
Came a long way (oh)
Pull out that Wraith
Niggas gon' hate
Marvelous day

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert & Gunna]
Yeah, young nigga came a long way (came a long way)
Yeah, used to be broke every day (broke every day)
Watch when I pull out that Wraith (pull out that Wraith)
A lot of these niggas gon' hate (niggas gon' hate)
Best to stay out of the way (out of the way)
They'll put you down in the grave (down in the grave)
My water ain't come out a lake (come out a lake)
Young nigga fly as a plane (fly as a plane)
I had a marvelous day (marvelous day, I did)
Ain't no baby bottles today (bottles today)
Took a model out and went on a date (went on a date, I did)
Put that dick all in her face (all in her face)
I'ma give me that piece of that cake (piece of that cake)
I'ma fly to Dubai on a plane (Dubai on a plane)
I'ma send my lil bitch out to Spain (Spain)
I'ma cover her body with Saint (Saint)

[Verse 1: Kap G]
You say you a shooter, you ain't (hey)
I ride around with that thing
John Wick with that aim (prr)
I'm drinkin' drank for the pain (oh)
I'm with Gunna and he rollin' (what up?)
Uzi got on Rick Owens
All this gas like I growed it
She on the poll like we voted (ooh)
I just see Cannon pull up in that panamera
Got sauce like marinara
Bitch, I'm Kap G, dinero
Uh, all that Gucci apparel (Kap G)
All that Louis apparel (Kap G)
Free Jno, free Gerald

My auntie like the smell of cocaine (smell of cocaine)

Hear the gun when I walk on the stage (walk on the stage)
Had to walk out and wait for a chain (wait for a chain)
'Bout to put some more ice on the ring (ice on the ring)
I'ma fuck her and love her with rage (love her with rage)
I'ma love her and fuck her with rage (fuck her with rage)
Hit it once and pull off in a Range (pull off in a Range)
Hit it once so I don't know your name (don't know your name)
Put me all in my chain like a stain (like a stain)

Gotta keep me a pint and stay sane

Thought I told you, that some of them lame
Yeah that, Kap G, my nigga, my mane
See done turned up a whole 'nother lane
We gon' count us a check, ease the pain
I said Kap we canâ€™t play no more games
We gon' chop down your block with the gang
Yeah, I used to have to ride a train
Yeah, spent twenty on a chain
Pussy boy, why you hatin'?
I ain't never been a lame (no)
I used to listen to Wayne (Young Money)
You think I ain't peepin' your game (game)
I know you peepin' my flavor (flavor)
They wanna be in my place (Kap G)

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert & Gunna]
