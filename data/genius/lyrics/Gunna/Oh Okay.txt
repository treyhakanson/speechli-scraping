Title: Oh Okay
Artist: Gunna

[Intro]
Run that back, Turbo
Playmakers

[Chorus: Gunna]
(Oh Okay)
Audemar wrist, count it then spend it
Matted the coupe, and my windows tinted
Chop off the top, headed to Lenox
I got some cash, I wanna spend it
New paper tag, didn't wanna rent it
Too many fads, too many bitches
Roll with my slime, yeah that my lizard
Ready to slide, you will get slithered
Hey, we ain't got ties, yeen gon' ride
Yeen my slime, yeen my slime
Young Gunna Gunna, I'm in my prime
Hey, so authentic, I ain't tellin' you lies
When it comes to business I'm handling mine
Yeah, I'ma kingface Patek my time

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Hey, pinstripe Gucci my pants
She can suck dick with no hands
I done spent some racks on my fam
Spaceship on land, Fear of God Vans
Another pint of red, drank to the head
Got two styrofoams, yeah, I'm sippin' these meds
Two tone Prezi Rolex, yeah this drip you can't catch
Simon says do what I said, Cuban link chokin' my neck
YSL Uber these jets, put 'em in some VVS

[Chorus: Gunna]
Audemar wrist, count it then spend it
Matted the coupe, and my windows tinted
Chop off the top, headed to Lenox
I got some cash, I wanna spend it
New paper tag, didn't wanna rent it
Too many fads, too many bitches
Roll with my slime, yeah that my lizard
Ready to slide, you will get slithered
Hey, we ain't got ties, yeen gon' ride
Yeen my slime, yeen my slime
Young Gunna Gunna, I'm in my prime
Hey, so authentic, ain't tellin' you lies
When it comes to business I'm handling mine
Yeah, I'ma kingface Patek my time

[Verse 2: Young Thug & Lil Baby]
Pateks on Pateks on Pateks on Pateks (oh-okay)
Run up a check and I'm fuckin' the baddest
Jump out the coupe and I'm living so lavish
R.I.P. Hugh Hefner, he like my daddy
I got some VVS's on my neck and my ears they real, dog
I done stayed down and I ran up the money, I got me an M now
S-L-I-M-E a slime, I say that shit every time
I got some rickety rackades
Running through bitches like Backpage
I'm going number one this year
Ride on this bitch, I'm in sixth gear 
I'm on a jet, ain't got no fear
Do all my dirt when it's raining
Wash away all the evidence
I got some chains and they tennis
Ride a Wraith like it's rented
I rock Givenchy, the vintage
Trap up the bando relentless
I triple-double the record
Put the Draco in my trench, yeah
I rob your ho for the lint, yeah
I triple-double the year, yeah
I put her coupe on my bill, yeah
I pay some shit, a whole mil
I did this shit with no deal
Dropped out of school, bought a building
I killed the coupe, dropped the ceiling
Cop a Bugatti out of there
I got on white, I can't kneel
Pour out the pint, watch it spill, yeah
My lawyer bribe still, yeah

[Chorus: Gunna]
Audemar wrist, count it then spend it
Matted the coupe, and my windows tinted
Chop off the top, headed to Lenox
I got some cash, I wanna spend it
New paper tag, didn't wanna rent it
Too many fads, too many bitches
Roll with my slime, yeah that my lizard
Ready to slide, you will get slithered
Hey, we ain't got ties, yeen gon' ride
Yeen my slime, yeen my slime
Young Gunna Gunna, I'm in my prime
Hey, so authentic, not tellin' you lies
When it comes to business I'm handling mine
Yeah, I'ma kingface Patek my time
