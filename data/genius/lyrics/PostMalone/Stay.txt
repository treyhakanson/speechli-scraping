Title: Stay
Artist: Post Malone


[Verse 1]
It's true that all that you know is all that you are
You said that it's all that you want and more
Fuck off and pour another drink
And tell me what you think
You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
You put your cigarette out on my face
So beautiful, please, woman

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (Tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (Waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me toâ€”

[Verse 2]
Stay a little longer if you convince me
And tell me all the things that you have against me
Every time we make up, the truth is fadin'
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you

[Pre-Chorus]
But don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (Tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (Waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (Tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (Waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay
