Title: Candy Paint
Artist: Post Malone


[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Mmm, ayy

[Chorus]
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, I'll SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
Candy paint with the white on top (Skrrt)
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop (Drop)
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, I'll SWAT, you thot (Pop)
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch (Bling)
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot (Swish)
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want

[Verse 1]
Didn't know that was your girl when she gave me top (Yuh)
Kicked her out the Rolls said, "Thanks a lot"
Goddamn, I love paper like I'm Michael Scott (Yeah)
I can do things that your man cannot (Yeah)
Slide boy comin' down, damn, I'm hot (Hot)
Everybody say that I gotta be stopped (Stopped)
Even though my final form ain't unlocked (Locked)
I'm so ahead of you muhfuckas'
How you comprehend what you ain't understandin'?
Count a hundred bands and I watch it vanish
Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor
Got a lot of ass, nothin' I can't handle

[Pre-Chorus]
Flavor lasts forever, you should try a sample (Goddamn)
Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza (Tony Danza)
Everybody tryna tell me what I stand for
But you don't fuckin' know me, homie, you don't want war (Ayy)

[Chorus]
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, I'll SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
Candy paint with the white on top (Skrrt)
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop (Drop)
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, I'll SWAT, you thot (Pop)
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch (Bling)
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot (Swish)
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want

[Verse 2]
I've been rollin' twenty ash, hit the road (woo)
Hit the switch up the suicide doors (damn)
We already know you vanished though (ooh)
Hit my momma when I ride in that, oh
All these muhfuckas' so false with me (yah)
If your money funny, don't talk to me (nah)
I know there ain't shit that you could offer me (no)
Take a second if you think about crossin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
Flavor lasts forever, you should try a sample (Goddamn)
Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza (Tony Danza)
Everybody tryna tell me what I stand for
But you don't fuckin' know me, homie, you don't want war (Ayy)

[Chorus]
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, I'll SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
Candy paint with the white on top (Skrrt)
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop (Drop)
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, I'll SWAT, you thot (Pop)
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch (Bling)
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot (Swish)
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
