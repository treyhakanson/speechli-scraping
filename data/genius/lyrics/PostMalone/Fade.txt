[Intro: Rare Earth]
Your love is fadin'
Your love is fadin'
Your love is fadin'
I feel it's fadin'

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Rare Earth]
When no one ain't around (I feel it's fadin')
I think I think too much (I feel it's fadin')
Ain't nobody watchin' (I feel it's fadin')
I just fade away

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign & Rare Earth]
I feel it
Fade away

Your love is fadin'

[Verse 1: Kanye West + Rare Earth  & Ty Dolla $ign]
Roll up, roll up; hold up, hold up; po' up, po' up

I'ma rock the boat, work the middle 'til it hurt a little
I feel it
Your love is fadin'
I feel it
Fuckin' with a real ass nigga
I feel it
Fuck how you feel ass nigga
I feel it
Bitch better act like you know better
I feel it
Woah

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Rare Earth]
When no one ain't around (I feel it's fadin')
I think I think too much (I feel it's fadin')
Ain't nobody watchin' (I feel it's fadin')
I just fade away (I feel it's fadin')

[Verse 2: Post Malone  & Rare Earth]
You don't even know, I've been so far gone (I feel it)
I've been so led on, I've been runnin' 'round (I feel it)
I've been on my shit, whole world on my dick (I feel it)
I just need to know (I can feel it)
