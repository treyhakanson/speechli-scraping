Title: Donatella
Artist: Lady Gaga

[Intro]
I am so fab
Check out:
I'm blonde, I'm skinny
I'm rich, and I'm a little bit of a bitch

[Verse 1]
I wanna dress you up in silk
Taffeta
Tailor these clothes to fit your guilt
What's your size?
This purse can hold my black card
And tiara
Versace promises I will
Dolce Vita

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

[Chorus]
Donatella!
(I’m smoking 'em on full tank of gas)
Mi-Mi-Bella
(I'm a rich bitch, I'm the upper class)
All of the day
(I’m the pearl to your oyster, I’m a babe)
I’m gonna smoke Marlboro Reds and drink Champagne
(I smoke Marlboro Reds and drink Champagne)

[Post-Chorus]
Donatella!
'Cause she walks so bad, like it feels so good
Listen to her radiate her magic
Even though she knows she’s misunderstood
Voodoo, voodoo
Voo-don-na-na

[Verse 2]
Walk down the runway, but don’t puke
It’s okay
You just had a salad today
Boulangerie
Just ask your gay friends their advice
Before you...
Get a spray tan on holiday
In Taipei

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

[Chorus]
Donatella!
(I’m smoking 'em on full tank of gas)
Mi-Mi-Bella
(I'm a rich bitch, I'm the upper class)
All of the day
(I’m the pearl to your oyster, I’m a babe)
I’m gonna smoke Marlboro Reds and drink Champagne
(I smoke Marlboro Reds and drink Champagne)

[Post-Chorus]
Donatella!
'Cause she walks so bad, like it feels so good
Listen to her radiate her magic
Even though she knows she’s misunderstood
Voodoo, voodoo
Voo-don-na-na

[Interlude]
Check it out, take it in
'Cause that bitch, she’s so thin (ooh, la-la-la)
She’s so rich, and so blonde
She’s so fab, it’s beyond

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

[Bridge]
Donatella!
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Donatella!
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I love the day
Oh-oh-oh-oh
All of the day
I’m gonna wear designer and forget your name
Donatella!
Donatella!

[Post-Chorus]
Donatella!
'Cause she walks so bad, like it feels so good
Listen to her radiate her magic
Even though she knows she’s misunderstood
Voodoo, voodoo
Voo-don-na-na
