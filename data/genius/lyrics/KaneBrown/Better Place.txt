Title: Better Place
Artist: Kane Brown

[Verse 1]
Baby, if your dream is forty acres and a house
Porch going all the way around
I'mma buy it
Or if you'd rather see
City lights and a crowd
I'mma move you uptown
It don't matter to me
Nah, it don't girl
Baby, I can see me livin' anywhere with you, so

[Chorus]
Til the sky falls and the good Lord calls us up
You're the only girl I wanna love
Til I'm pushing up daisies
Wanna stare into your green eyes, baby
Til we're hand-in-hand walking down them streets of gold
Six feet below, you know
I'm gonna make your world a better place
Til we're both in a better place

[Verse 2]
If all you wanna wear is faded blue jeans and a tee
Baby, that's fine with me
You look good in anything
Aw, but girl I swear
If you wanna hit the town in a dress, turn a few heads
I ain't gonna stop you
Baby, I got you, oh

[Chorus]
Til the sky falls and the good Lord calls us up
You're the only girl I wanna love
Til I'm pushing up daisies
Wanna stare into your green eyes, baby
Til we're hand-in-hand walking down them streets of gold
Six feet below, you know
I'm gonna make your world a better place
Til we're both in a better place

[Bridge]
Every night, every day
You're my everything
Til we fade away

[Chorus]
Til the sky falls and the good Lord calls us up
You're the only girl I wanna love
Til I'm pushing up daisies
Wanna stare into your green eyes, baby
Til we're hand-in-hand walking down them streets of gold
Six feet below, you know
I'm gonna make your world a better place
Til we're both in a better place
Til we're both in a better place
Better place girl
