Title: Homesick
Artist: Kane Brown

[Verse 1]
Dancin' in the kitchen, you singing my favorite songs
Swinging on the front porch, just laughing at the dogs
How you swear you love me more
When you're whisperin' goodnight
All those little moments are every reason why

[Chorus]
I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feeling'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
Then I'm homesick for you

[Verse 2]
Well it says Kane Brown
On a sign with a line out the door
It sold out some little town
I've never been before
Yeah, they're screamin' my name
This is what we dreamed about
But out here singin' about you, baby, all I think about

[Chorus]
Is how I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the morning
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you

[Bridge]
Homesick for you
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes, just tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby, that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you
I'm homesick for you
Yeah, yeah
