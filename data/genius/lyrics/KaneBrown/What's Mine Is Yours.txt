Title: What's Mine Is Yours
Artist: Kane Brown

[Verse 1]
Wasn't really looking when you caught my eyes
Just another town, just another night
Didn't say much, I was scared for my life
I didn't catch your number and didn't know your name
Tried to move on, couldn't help to think of you
And I knew that you'd change everything

[Chorus]
What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
Yeah, you saved me
You got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours

[Verse 2]
Now there's make up my counter
Your shoes on my floor
Taking my side of the bed and more
But it’s fine, I don’t mind, 'cause you changed everything

[Chorus]
What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
Yeah, you saved me
You got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Take this ring
Forever now
Til death do us apart
And take this vow

[Chorus]
What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
Yeah, you saved me
You got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
Yeah, yeah
