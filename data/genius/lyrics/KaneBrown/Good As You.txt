Title: Good As You
Artist: Kane Brown

[Verse 1]
See the way you're taking care of your Mama
The way you’re taking care of me
The way you light up any room, girl
You're what this world should be

[Pre-Chorus]
Tomorrow, tonight, the rest of my life
I wanna be the man you want me to be
So startin' right now, girl, tell me everything you need

[Chorus]
I just wanna wake up everyday here in this bed
Never leave "I love you" left unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you

[Verse 2]
Girl, you’re more than just the surface
Yeah, you got that heart of gold
So when it comes to loving you, babe
No, it will never get old

[Pre-Chorus]
Tomorrow, tonight, the rest of my life
I wanna be the man you want me to be
So startin' right now, girl, tell me everything you need

[Chorus]
I just wanna wake up everyday here in this bed
Never leave "I love you" left unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you
Good as you, baby

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I just wanna wake up everyday here in this bed
Never leave "I love you" left unsaid
In my take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you
I just wanna wake up everyday here in this bed (Yeah with you baby)
Never leave "I love you left" unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you
Baby, I just wanna be good as you
