Title: Lose It
Artist: Kane Brown

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
That lit up, ringing, buzzing good for nothing phone in your hands
With directions to the party that's just started with that cover band
That old school radio station, let's just drive until it's faded
Girl, let's lose it, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby, I swear

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Verse 2]
Let's start with them Luccheses
Baby, kick 'em to the floorboard
Them bobby pins holdin' your hair up
Girl, you don't need 'em no more
That dress hangin' off your shoulder as you move a little closer
Yeah, let's lose it tonight
Yeah girl

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doin' to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Bridge]
'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby I swear
Um

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Outro]
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
