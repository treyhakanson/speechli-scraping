Title: What Ifs
Artist: Kane Brown

[Verse 1: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
What if this goes south, what if I mess you up?
You say what if I break your heart in two, then what?

[Pre-Chorus: Kane Brown]
Well I hear you girl, I feel you girl, but not so fast
Before you make your mind up, I gotta ask

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Verse 2: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if the sky falls (sky falls)
Or the sun stops burnin'?
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'?
Or I could kiss you (you should kiss me)
What if you liked it? (bet I'd like it)
Well we ain't never gonna know unless we try it

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?
Awe yeah
C'mon

[Bridge: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you?
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
Damn

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Outro: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
Away (away)
What if?
