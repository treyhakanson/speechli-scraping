Title: Found You
Artist: Kane Brown

[Verse 1]
I be sitting in the same old bar
Heart breaking on a broken bar stool
Wishing she'd come running back
Running from the past
Runnin' up the tab, drinkin' for two
But that night my boys showed up
Dragged me out on the town
Had to pick me up
I'd never know what I was missin' if they didn't

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
Never found you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I still go out sometimes
But I don't ever try to get that drunk
Now and I can't sleep it's 'cause you're all over me in the sheets
All night keeping me up
Yeah, it's hard to believe that a goodbye could be
So good to me

[Chorus]
No, I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you

[Bridge]
And now I'm takin' back the way I said I wish I've never met
Sometimes the things that don't work out
Couldn't work out any better
I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
Never found, never found you
No, I'd have never found you
