Title: Girls
Artist: Rita Ora

[Verse 1: Rita Ora]
Her name is Lara, we learned a lot, ah
How to do it, like we do it like we wanna
We just know, we just know
I ain't one-sided, I'm open-minded
I'm 50/50 and I'm never gonna hide it
You should know, eh, you should know, ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
All summer, we've been in the 'Bu
'68 Chevy with nothin' to do
Just rollin' J's, kush lovin'
And last night, yeah, we got with the dude
I saw him, he was lookin' at you
So I said, "Hey," kush lovin'

[Chorus: Rita Ora & Charli XCX]
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha & Charli XCX]
Yeah, you know I tamed it, and then I named it
I put the lion in the cage and then I laid with
Her all night (All night), her all night, yeah
I'm the hunter and she the prey, yeah
I'm the thriller and the killer and the saviour
Up all night, we up all night, yeah (Do it one more time)

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora, Bebe Rexha & Both]
All summer, we've been in the 'Bu (Oh)
'68 Chevy with nothin' to do
Just rollin' J's, kush lovin' (Roll it out, roll it out)

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha, Rita Ora & Charli XCX]
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
(You know that I do)
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls

[Bridge: Charli XCX, Rita Ora, Both & (Cardi B)]
She gettin' down with me, yeah-ah
She gettin' down with me, yeah-ah
She gettin' down with me, yeah-ah
Oh, we can go up
She gettin' down with me, yeah-ah
She gettin' down with me, yeah-ah
She gettin' down with me, yeah-ah (Rita, look, Cardi)

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Now I could be your lipstick, just for one night (One night)
Girls just wanna have fun and have their funds right (Yeah)
I mean, say my name, say my name, say my name (Say my name)
It tastes good just rollin' off your tongue, right? (Hurrr)
I put this MAC on your lips, so pucker up (Mwah)
We ain't never heard of you 'cause you ain't done enough (No)
And I don't gotta introduce myself (Cardi!)
I'm too sexy, I seduce myself (Bardi!)
Seven-figure, never need a nigga (Nope)
I steal your bitch, have her down with the scissor
Tonight, I don't want a dog, I want a kitten (Eeeow)
I might French a girl from Great Britain

[Chorus: Rita Ora, Bebe Rexha, Charli XCX & Cardi B]
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls (Oh yeah)
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls (Uh, yeah)
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls (Red wine, red wine)
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls (Oh, oh, oh)
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls

[Outro: Rita Ora, Bebe Rexha, Charli XCX & Cardi B]
She gettin' down with me, yeah-ah
(Down with me)
She gettin' down with me, yeah-ah
(She gettin' down on me, ahh)
She gettin' down with me, yeah-ah (Yeah)
(Down with me, yeah)
She likes what she likes (Aha)
She gettin' down with me, yeah-ah (Yeah)
She gettin' down with me, yeah-ah (Ah-ha)
She gettin' down with me, yeah-ah
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls
Hehehehe-aha (Hahahaha)
