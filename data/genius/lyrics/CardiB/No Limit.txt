Title: No Limit
Artist: G-Eazy

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money dance turn this shit into a nightclub

[Post-Chorus: G-Eazy]
Ayy, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Yeah, ayy, fuck with me and get some money
Ayy, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Ayy, yeah, fuck with G and get some money

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
No limit, I'm a fucking soldier, ayy
Always lit, yeah, I'm never sober
It's been three days in a row, your bitch coming over
Told that bitch to kick rocks, she act like it's a boulder, ayy
'Rari, shopping, let me, cop it
Always, poppin', hella, poppin'
She's a, bopper, homie, hoppin'
Ain't no, stopping, album, dropping
Got the city on fire
Bitch lying on me like she tired
I might have to fuck around and call Kamaiyah
Ho stirring up the pot, jambalaya
Young Gerald

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money, dance, turn this shit into a nightclub

[Post-Chorus: Cardi B]
Fuck him then I get some money
Fuck him then I get some money
Fuck him then I get some money
Fuck him then I get some money

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
I need tongue, I need face, give me brain, concentrate
Apple phone, Prada case, kill a weave, rock a lace
Fuck the Moët, buy the Ace, fuck the Ghost, drive the Wraith
Get some money, flood the Rollie, fuck the Rollie, Patek face
My career takin' off, these hoes jogging in place
Swear these hoes run they mouth, how these hoes out of shape?
Can you stop with all the subs? Bitch, I ain’t Jared
If you really want some smoke, you can pull up, you can get it
Grab a hand full of braids, make your nigga eat me out
Put a white boy on Sazón, I might turn G-Eazy out
Keep it G from the club 'til the end from the start
You know me, Cardi B, pussy poppin’ on the charts, ah, ah!

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money, dance, turn this shit into a nightclub

[Post-Chorus: G-Eazy]
Ayy, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Yeah, ayy, fuck with me and get some money
Ayy, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Ayy, yeah, fuck with G and get some money

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Yeah, it ain't nice, fam
You can study where I'm from on my Viceland
This is nothing new to me, this my life, fam
I can pull a million girls from a mic stand
Pull one at my show 'cause I like fans
Later on, I got two in my night plans
Man this year, I had 300 one night stands
Keep a Costco pack of rubbers in my night stand
Damn Daniel, back again with the, hah, Saint-Laurent
Ayy, they send me product, yeah, it's retarded
Ayy, this was free, ayy, bitch you bought it
Bitch you on my dick, ayy, bitch get off it

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & (G-Eazy)]
If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her (I like her)
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her (wife her)
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit  bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money, dance, turn this shit into a nightclub

[Post-Chorus: G-Eazy]
Ayy, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Yeah, ayy, fuck with me and get some money
Ayy, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Ayy, yeah, fuck with G and get some money
