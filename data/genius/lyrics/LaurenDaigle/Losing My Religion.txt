Title: Losing My Religion
Artist: Lauren Daigle

[Verse 1]
I've been an actor on a stage
Playing a role I have to play
I'm getting tired, it's safe to say
Living behind a masquerade

[Verse 2]
No more performing out of fear
Trying to keep my conscience clear
It all seems so insincere
I'd trade it all to meet You here

[Chorus 1]
I'm losing my religion
I'm losing my religion

[Verse 3]
Light a match and watch it burn
To Your heart I will return
No one could love me like You do
Why would I want a substitute

[Chorus 2]
I'm losing my religion
I'm losing my religion
I'm losing my religion
I'm losing my religion
To find You

[Bridge]
I'm losing my religion, and finding something new
I need something different, and different looks like You
I'm losing my religion, and finding something new
'Cause I need something different, and different looks like You

[Chorus 3]
I'm losing my religion
I'm losing my religion
I'm losing my religion
I'm losing my religion
To find You, to find You
To find You, to find You
You
