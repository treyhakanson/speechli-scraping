Title: Look Up Child
Artist: Lauren Daigle

[Verse 1]
Where are You now
When darkness seems to win
Where are You now
When the world is crumbling

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I, I
I hear You say
I hear You say

[Chorus]
Look up child
Look up child

[Verse 2]
Where are You now (Where are You?)
When all I feel is doubt
Where are You now
When I can't figure it out

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I, I
I hear You say
I hear You say

[Chorus]
Look up child
Look up child
Look up child
Look up child
Look upâ€¦

[Bridge]
You're not threatened by the war
You're not shaken by the storm
I know You're in control
Even in our suffering
Even when it can't be seen
I know You're in control

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I, I
I hear You say
I hear You say

[Chorus]
Look up child
Look up child
Look up child
I hear You say, You say, You say
Look up child
I hear You say, You say, You say (Look up, look up, look up, look up)
Look up child
I hear You say, You say, You say
Look up child
I hear You say, You say, You say (Look up, look up, look up, look up)
Look up child
I hear You say, You say, You say
I hear You, I hear You calling my name, oh
Look up child
I hear You say, You say, You say (Look up, look up)
Look up child
Look up child
Look up
