Title: Still Rolling Stones
Artist: Lauren Daigle

[Verse 1]
Out of the shadows
Bound for the gallows
A dead man walking
'Til love came calling
Rise up (rise up)
Rise up (rise up)

Six feet under
I thought it was over
An answer to prayer
The voice of a Savior
Rise up (rise up)
Rise up (rise up)

[Chorus]
All at once I came alive
This beating heart, these open eyes
The grave let go
The darkness should have known
(You're still rolling rolling, you're still rolling rolling oh)
You're still rolling stones
(You're still rolling rolling oh)
You're still rolling stones

[Verse 2]
Now that You saved me
I sing, 'cause You gave me
A song of revival
I put it on vinyl
Rise up (rise up)
Rise up (rise up)

I once was blinded
But now I see it
I've heard about the power
And now I believe it
Rise up (rise up)
Rise up (rise up)

[Chorus]
All at once I came alive
This beating heart, these open eyes
The grave let go
The darkness should have known
(You're still rolling rolling, you're still rolling rolling oh)
You're still rolling stones
(You're still rolling rolling oh)
You're still rolling stones

[Bridge]
I thought that I was too far gone
For everything I've done wrong
Yeah I'm the one who dug this grave
But You called my name
You called my name
I thought that I was too far gone
For everything I've done wrong
Yeah I'm the one who dug this grave
But You called my name
You called my name

[Chorus]
All at once I came alive
This beating heart, these open eyes
The grave let go
The darkness should have known
(You're still rolling rolling, you're still rolling rolling oh)
You're still rolling stones
(You're still rolling rolling oh)

[Outro]
You're still rolling stones
(You're still rolling rolling oh, you're still rolling rolling oh)
You're still rolling stones
(You're still rolling rolling oh)
You're still rolling stones (you're still rolling, rolling)
(You're still rolling rolling oh, you're still rolling rolling oh)
You're still rolling rolling
(You're still rolling rolling oh)
You're still rolling stones

[Instrumental]
