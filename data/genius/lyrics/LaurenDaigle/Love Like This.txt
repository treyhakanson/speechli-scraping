Title: Love Like This
Artist: Lauren Daigle

[Verse 1]
When I am a wasteland
You are the water
When I am the winter
You are the fire
That burns

[Verse 2]
When I am a long night
You are the sunrise
When I am a desert
You are the river that turns
To find me

[Chorus 1]
What have I done to deserve love like this?
What have I done to deserve love like this?

[Verse 3]
Your voice like a whisper
Breaking the silence
You say there's a treasure
You look 'til You find it
You search to find me

[Chorus 2]
What have I done to deserve love like this?
What have I done to deserve love like this?
I cannot earn what You so freely give
What have I done to deserve love like this?

[Bridge]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Chorus 2]
What have I done to deserve love like this?
What have I done to deserve love like this?
I cannot earn what You so freely give
What have I done to deserve love like this?
