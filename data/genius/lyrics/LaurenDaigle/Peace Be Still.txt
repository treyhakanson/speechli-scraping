Title: Peace Be Still
Artist: The Belonging Co

[Verse 1]
I don't want to be afraid
Every time I face the waves
I don't want to be afraid
I don't want to be afraid
I don't want to fear the storm
Just because I hear it roar
I don't want to fear the storm
I don't want to fear the storm

[Chorus]
Peace be still
Say the word and I will
Set my feet upon the sea
Till I'm dancing in the deep
Oh, peace be still
You are here so it is well
Even when my eyes can't see
I will trust the voice that speaks

[Verse 2]
I'm not gonna be afraid
'Cause these waves are only waves
Oh, I'm not gonna be afraid
I'm not gonna be afraid
I'm not gonna fear the storm
You are greater than its roar
I'm not gonna fear the storm
Oh, I'm not gonna fear at all, yeah

[Chorus]
Peace be still
Say the word and I will
Set my feet upon the sea
Till I'm dancing in the deep, oh
Peace be still
You are here so it is well
Even when my eyes can't see
I will trust the voice that speaks
Peace, peace, yes
Over me, yeah
Oh Jesus, let Your peace calm them
Oo-ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
Let faith rise up
Oh heart believe
Let faith rise up in me
Let faith rise up
Oh heart believe
Let faith rise up in me
Let faith rise up
Oh heart believe
Let faith rise up in me, oh-ooh
Let faith rise up
Oh heart believe
Let faith rise up in me, yeah

[Chorus]
Peace be still
Say the word and I will
Set my feet upon the sea
Till I'm dancing in the deep, Lord
Peace be still
You are here so it is well
Even when my eyes can't see
I will trust the voice that speaks
Peace, peace, yes
Over me, yes Jesus
Oh, peace, peace, Lord
Over me, yeah, yeah

[Spontaneous]
Lord Jesus
You're the God of peace, Jesus
Ooh-ooh
You're our peace in the storm
You're righting every wrong, Jesus
Oh yeah, we receive it, we receive it
Oh, let the peace come and wash over all the kneelers
Oh-oh, ah
We press into you
Oh Jesus, You make our hearts stay calm
'Cause You increase the strength of Your children, ooh

[Bridge]
So let faith rise up
Oh heart believe
Let faith rise up in me
It's our prayer tonight
Let faith rise up
Oh heart believe
Let faith rise up in me
One more time, again
Let faith rise up
Oh heart believe it
Let faith rise up in me
Oh let faith rise up
Oh heart believe it
Let faith rise up in me, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh peace be still
Say the word and I will
Set my feet upon the sea
Till I'm dancing in the deep, Lord
Peace be still
You are here so it is well
Even when my eyes can't see
I will trust the voice that speaks
Peace, peace, yes
Over me, yeah
Peace, Jesus, peace, yes
Over me, yeah

[Outro]
Hallelujah
You bring peace, Jesus
Yeah, yeah, oh
Let it wash over you
Let it wash over you and I
