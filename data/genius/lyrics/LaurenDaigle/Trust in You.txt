Title: Trust in You
Artist: Lauren Daigle

[Verse 1]
Letting go of every single dream
I lay each one down at Your feet
Every moment of my wandering
Never changes what You see

[Verse 2]
I’ve tried to win this war I confess
My hands are weary I need Your rest
Mighty Warrior, King of the fight
No matter what I face, You’re by my side

[Chorus]
When You don’t move the mountains I’m needing You to move
When You don’t part the waters I wish I could walk through
When You don’t give the answers as I cry out to You
I will trust, I will trust, I will trust in You

[Verse 3]
Truth is, You know what tomorrow brings (tomorrow brings)
There’s not a day ahead You have not seen (You have not seen)
So, in all things be my life and breath
I want what You want, Lord, and nothing less

[Chorus]
When You don’t move the mountains I’m needing You to move
When You don’t part the waters I wish I could walk through
When You don’t give the answers as I cry out to You
I will trust, I will trust, I will trust in You

[Bridge]
You are my strength and comfort
You are my steady hand
You are my firm foundation; the rock on which I stand
Your ways are always higher
Your plans are always good
There’s not a place where I’ll go, You’ve not already stood

[Chorus]
When You don’t move the mountains I’m needing You to move
When You don’t part the waters I wish I could walk through
When You don’t give the answers as I cry out to You
I will trust, I will trust, I will trust in You

[Outro]
I will trust in You
I will trust in You
I will trust in You
