Title: Wordless
Artist: Lauren Daigle

[Verse 1]
There isn't any fear here
There isn't any fear in love
When You come, when You come
There isn't any hurt here
That You don't overwhelm
When You come, when You come, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I am speechless, but I can't keep quiet
And I am wordless, but I can't stay silent
Oohooh, oohooh

[Verse 2]
There isn't any rush here
So I'm just gonna wait on You
And linger longer oh
'Cause every time I find You
I'm a little more undone
When You come, when You come

[Pre-Chorus]
I am speechless, but I can't keep quiet
And I am wordless, but I can't stay silent

[Chorus]
Oohooh, I'm lost for words to say
Oohooh, You take my breath away
Oohooh, I'm lost for words to say
Oohooh, You take my breath away

[Bridge]
Oh, You move me, and I can't define it
You consume me, and I can't describe it
Oh, I am speechless, but I can't keep quiet
And I am wordless, but I can't stay silent, silent, whoa

[Chorus]
Whoa, I'm lost for words to say
Whoa, You take my breath away
Whoa, I'm lost for words to say
Whoa, You take my breath away

[Outro]
There isn't any fear here
There isn't any fear in love
