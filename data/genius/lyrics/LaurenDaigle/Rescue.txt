Title: Rescue
Artist: Lauren Daigle

[Verse 1]
You are not hidden
There's never been a moment
You were forgotten
You are not hopeless
Though you have been broken
Your innocence stolen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I hear you whisper underneath your breath
I hear your SOS, your SOS

[Chorus 1]
I will send out an army to find You
In the middle of the darkest night
It's true, I will rescue you

[Verse 2]
There is no distance
That cannot be covered
Over and over
You're not defenseless
I'll be your shelter
I'll be your armor

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I hear you whisper underneath Your breath
I hear your SOS, your SOS

[Chorus 2]
I will send out an army to find You
In the middle of the darkest night
It's true, I will rescue you
I will never stop marching to reach you
In the middle of the hardest fight
It's true, I will rescue you

[Bridge]
I hear the whisper underneath Your breath
I hear you whisper, you have nothing left

[Chorus 2]
I will send out an army to find You
In the middle of the darkest night
It's true, I will rescue you
I will never stop marching to reach you
In the middle of the hardest fight
It's true, I will rescue you

[Outro]
Oh, I will rescue you
