Title: Amen
Artist: Meek Mill

[Intro: Meek Mill]
I just wanna thank God
For all the pretty women he let into my life
All the Benjamins you let me count
Wealth and health
For my family
And lettin' me ball on these niggas

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)
I'm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)
I tell the waiter fifty bottles and she tell me say when
And I say church (Preach)
We make it light up like a church (Preach)
She wanna fuck and I say church (Preach)
Do Liv on Sunday like a church (Preach)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Bottle after bottle, drink until I overdose
Pull up in the Phantom, watch them bitches catch the Holy Ghost
Errtime I step up in the dealer I be goin' broke
Shorty wanna fuck me, I say get on top and roller coast
And I lay back, she go cray, fuck me good, but she no stay
Murder on that pussy let her boyfriend get that DOA
Get it? And all I get is Frito Lay
Plus I'm on probation, when they test me I just pee Ros√©
Cause last night, I went hard, Peach Ciroc, Patron and all
Thirty racks on magnum bottles, I think I was born to ball
Lookin' like a million plus, fresh I'm out that corner store
Hater I be doin' me, you guys should be doin' y'all
I'm stackin' money to the ceiling
All this ice that's in my Rollie I be chilling
And I just made a couple million
So I could take care of them children, let's go

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)
I'm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)
I tell the waiter fifty bottles and she tell me say when
And I say church (Preach)
We make it light up like a church (Preach)
She wanna fuck and I say church (Preach)
Do Liv on Sunday like a church (Preach)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Just bought my niggas some caine, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumping the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I'm forgiven for carin' 'bout how they livin'
And loanin a little money and keepin' 'em out of prison
I ain't lyin' in my verses I'm just telling you the basics
Of growin' up with your friends and becomin the one that made it
Yes lord! All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talking bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin' like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and your hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life puttin on, you spend your whole life puttin up
Ain't no telling when I go, so there ain't shit that I'ma wait for
I'm the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)
I'm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)
I tell the waiter fifty bottles and she tell me say when
And I say church (Preach)
We make it light up like a church (Preach)
She wanna fuck and I say church (Preach)
Do Liv on Sunday like a church (Preach)

[Verse 3: Meek Mill and Jeremih]
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm just tryna win
And she a devil in a dress but if she knock I let her in
And if she knock I let her in
I have her wet by 12 o' clock, then 3 o' clock she wet again
I'm screaming Oh Lord, that pussy good, that pussy good
I'm tryna hold on, I wish I could, you think I should
She got that million dollar body, shorty my Bugatti
And she said she got a man, we keep it secret Illuminati
(Got Patron on deck) And Ciroc all in my bottle
(Push it all on her) She was on that Reposado
(She take it all off) And I think I'll rep Serato
In this bitch I'm spending like I hit the lotto, cause it's a lot of...

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)
I'm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)
I tell the waiter fifty bottles and she tell me say when
And I say church (Preach)
We make it light up like a church (Preach)
She wanna fuck and I say church (Preach)
