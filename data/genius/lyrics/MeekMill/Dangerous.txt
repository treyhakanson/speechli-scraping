Title: Dangerous
Artist: Meek Mill

[Intro]
Right Now Sound
Hitmaka!

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in your eyes, shit is dangerous
Grateful I had all the patience
I know you going through some changes
You taking pictures, know your angles
Ooh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
No angel, but you got a halo
When it's nights like this
I really wanna be right here
I really wanna take you there (you there, oh there)
When it's nights like this
I really wanna be right here (be right here)
I really wanna take you there (you there, baby, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill & Jeremih]
Uh, it was nights like this, feelin' right like this
I never really spent no time like this, huh
The second time at the crib knowin' I might not hit
You said, "What I look like?" Like my bitch, yeah
Look into your eyes, shit is dangerous
The pussy wet, I call it angel dust
I done put so many diamond chains on you, they get tangled up
I never felt like this, it's strange as fuck (that's what it's like loving you)
Got yo ex nigga calling, but he can't do much
'Cause you with the kid now, Ella Mai, boo'd up
And all you gotta do is call and watch that Wraith pull up
Under the stars since they throwin' all that shade on us
Facts, woo!

[Chorus: PnB Rock, Jeremih & Both]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous (Your eyes)
Grateful I had all the patience, hey
I know you going through some changes
You taking pictures, know your angles
Ooh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for
That's what it's like loving you

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Uh, you feel the vibe, uh, I'm deep inside, yeah
You fuckin' me, ooh, I let you ride, yeah
At first you curved me, I let you slide in
Yo hips so curvy, you let me slide in
Ooh, and it was over once I flipped you over
Relation goal when we come through just like Beyonc√©, Hova
This that Hermes money, this ain't no Fashion Nova
You said yo ex had you depressed and I'm just glad that's over
'Cause now you rockin' with a real one
And when I'm in it, you be maxin' on a million
And when I hit it back to back, you make me still cum
I know them bitches hatin' on you, we gon' kill them
That's facts

[Chorus: PnB Rock, Jeremih & Both]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous (Your eyes)
Grateful I had all the patience
I know you going through some changes
You taking pictures, know your angles
Ooh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for
That's what it's like loving you

[Verse 4: PnB Rock & Jeremih]
Ayy, you know you bad babe
You know I laugh at these shawties that try to text back
You from the projects, but so exotic
Just give me all of that pussy, so many options (so many options)
Girl, you got me callin', all these different numbers
Why you being selfish? You know that I want you
You be leavin' work and you deserve a Birkin
Girl, you so contagious, damn that shit so dangerous

[Chorus: PnB Rock, Jeremih & Both]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous
Grateful I had all the patience
I know you going through some changes
You taking pictures, know your angles
Ooh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for
That's what it's like loving you
