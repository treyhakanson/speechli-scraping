Title: Minute
Artist: NAV & Metro Boomin

[Intro: Young Nudy and Future]
Yo...
Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus: NAV]
I'm balling, so I put some diamonds on my fists
Punch you in your mouth, leave diamonds on your lip
Selling that rerock, repressin' a block, slide on your block
Depressing my opps

[Verse 1: NAV]
Counting all this money, getting used to having it
My wallet costs more than what I used to have in it
Ayo, Pierre, do you wanna come in here?
I got lots of girls and I got lots of drugs in here
In my studio, it feels like it's a club in here
Bitches fucking 'bout a double, ain't no dubbing here
Diamonds shining, I feel like I got the sun in here
Shooters around me, who you think you're sonning here?
I take a Fanta and I put some mud in there
You say you've got a party, I'ma pop up there
You a cub, your main bitch fuck me like I'm papa bear
You the type to wild out when the cops are there
I found a trap, my pans and all my pots are there
I'm going fast, who you think you're stopping here?

[Chorus: NAV]
I'm balling, so I put some diamonds on my fists
Punch you in your mouth, leave diamonds on your lip
Selling that rerock, repressin' a block, slide on your block
Depressing my opps

[Post-Hook: NAV]
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
I'ma hit it and quit it
You need some drink, plug gon' pull up in a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Gettin dressed up in designer, give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Getting a hundred dollar line-up, give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute

[Verse 2: Offset]
Offset!
Give me a minute
The coupe is tinted
Ninth-inning
It's time to go get it
I used to be trappin' pigeons, now push start and crank the engine
Wrists on frigid, glisten, listen, hundred round drum with the biscuit
La di da di put her on molly, fuck on top of the 'Rari
Python Audi, sitting on Forgi's white baby body
I thank the plug 'cause me alive
My uncle cooking up dope in front my eyes
Told you open the door, go get the five
She on the perc, now it's a vibe
I get the bag it's automatic, she on the Addy'
I got some cash inside the mattress, I got more in the attic
I'm high fashion like I imagined, look at my status
Look at the mathematics, look at the baddies
All made of plastic, I bet this money gon last me
I stay in my lane, I don't crash it
Wake up lil nigga, you lackin' (wake up)
Droppin' the phone, I pass it

[Chorus: NAV]
I'm balling, so I put some diamonds on my fists
Punch you in your mouth, leave diamonds on your lip
Selling that rerock, repressin' a block, slide on your block
Depressing my opps

[Post-Chorus: NAV]
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
I'ma hit it and quit it
You need some drink, I'm pull up in a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Gettin dressed up in designer, give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Getting a hundred dollar line-up, give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute

[Verse 3: Playboi Carti]
Got young Navi on the phone, he asking for some wock
Got some bitches in my home, they cookin' on the pot
Know some niggas in the A, still trappin' at the spot
And we robbing all you niggas, we taking off your top
Iâ€™m in Fulton with the slimes, we pull up with them mops
And when I'm talking, 'bout the Mob, that's Harlem to the Bronx
I use to ride round with that Glock, but now I'm way too hot
Got some niggas who do time for Carti, 'cause they got they Guap
Got some paparazzi looking at me, waiting on the flop
Fuck these little niggas hating, snitching like some cop

[Chorus: NAV]
I'm balling, so I put some diamonds on my fists
Punch you in your mouth, leave diamonds on your lip
Selling that rerock, repressin' a block, slide on your block
Depressing my opps

[Post-Chorus: NAV]
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
I'ma hit it and quit it
You need some drink, I'm pull up in a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Gettin dressed up in designer, give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Getting a hundred dollar line-up, give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute

[Outro]
Metro Boomin' want some more nigga
Yo, Pierre, you wanna come out here?
