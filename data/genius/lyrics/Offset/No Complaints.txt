Title: No Complaints
Artist: Metro Boomin

[Intro: Offset & Future]
Know what I'm sayin'?
Fuck what y'all niggas doin'
What you got goin' on, what's happenin'?
Yeah, know what I'm sayin'?
Real niggas in this mothafucka, mane
Hell yeah, y'all niggas lame as hell
Y'all niggas, man, know what I'm sayin'?
(If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)
Hey!

[Chorus: Offset]
Ain't no complaints (Nah)
Racks in the bank (Racks)
Fuck what you think (Huh?)
We got some rank (Rank)
Leave your ass stank (Bow)
Robbin' the bank (Bank)
Pull out the banger (Raahhh)
You was a stranger (Stranger)
We don't relate (No)
Racks in the... (Rack)
Racks in the safe (Safe)
Steak on my plate (Steak)
My sons are Dons (Dons)
My bitch Amazon (Bad)
My plug is hund (Offset, plug)
She fuckin' for some (Smash)

[Verse 1: Offset]
I wanna be like Muhammad Ali (Hey)
Hang on the ropes and I beat you to sleep (Hey)
Taught to get money 'cause talk is too cheap (Cheap)
Quarter million when you open my brief
Celebrity status so keep this shit brief (Huh)
Draco by me 'cause I keep it in reach
Know niggas didn't do that shit like that boy Meech (Nah)
That's word on the street, let me preach, let me preach (Preach)
Listen, lil' nigga, sometimes you don't speak
Pull out that stick and I'm sweepin' the street (Bow, bow)
I make a quarter million every week (Hey)
She sucked out my soul, it's makin' me weak (Woo)
I've been on Percocets for the last week (Perc)
Sippin' on lean, I'm sleep, geeked (Geeked)
Move out the way, beep, beep (Beep)
Quit ridin' the waves, the sea deep (Woah)

[Chorus: Offset]
Ain't no complaints (Nah)
Racks in the bank (Racks)
Fuck what you think (Huh?)
We got some rank (Rank)
Leave your ass stank (Bow)
Robbin' the bank (Bank)
Pull out the banger (Raahhh)
You was a stranger (Stranger)
We don't relate (No)
Racks in the... (Rack)
Racks in the safe (Safe)
Steak on my plate (Steak)
My sons are Dons (Dons)
My bitch Amazon (Bad)
My plug is hund (Plug)
She fuckin' for some

[Verse 2: Drake]
At 17, I wanted everything that was in store
At 23, I bought it all just to make sure, yeah, yeah
Fuck a delay (Yeah)
They gotta pay (Yeah)
Like it's back in the day (Ayy)
Racks in the (What?)
Racks in the safe (Safe)
Look at my face (Jheeze)
Up there with the greats (Uh)
Steps that I take
You can't retrace (Nah)
Young Metro on bass (Bass)
Me, I'm just based (Based)
Can't afford no mistakes
Everything just in case
Billboard where I play
They welcome me, I overstay
I'm a huncho, I'm the boss
My set takin' off
Polo used to be Lacoste
Water used to be the tap, nigga, not the Voss
Damn, things changed (Changed)
I'm so awake (Woke)
You take the bait (Bait)
You get replaced
You do the math, nigga
On 88 dates (Cash)
The take-home was crazy
I take home your baby, yeah!

[Chorus: Offset]
Ain't no complaints (Nah)
Racks in the bank (Racks)
Fuck what you think (Huh?)
We got some rank (Rank)
Leave your ass stank (Bow)
