Artist: Young Thug

[Intro: Young Thug]
I done put 20 up under the Sig...
Ya dig, ya dig
Ya dig

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I done put 20 inside the Sig (ya dig)
I pull up on you and I pop at your kid (ya dig)
I pull up to your block and I pop at your wig (ya dig)
I hopped out the Coupe and I'm fresh as a bitch (ya dig, ya dig, ya dig)
Since I was a youngin', I been gettin' dough (ya dig, ya dig)
I count my backend and I turn up the show (ya dig, ya dig)
I want hella Xans, they get me off (ya dig, ya dig)
I put the V neck on my team, yeah (ya dig, ya dig)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I dig everything that you sayin'
I dig everything that you doin', too
I dig the way that you look at me
You dig the way that I look at you
I just wanna grab on your butt, but
The seat in the Benz, the Chanel Clutch
The FN, it give him a haircut
I roll up a seven of John Dutch
That big booty bounce on the dick and it broke
I don't gotta act like a gangsta and she know, dope
My Backwood look like a pole, yeah
My Backwood look like a pole
I sit on clouds of the smoke
I'mma blow pounds of the smoke
Pardon me, pardon my soul
I crack a smile for them folks
Niggas they eatin' in broad day
In that hoe mouth like a Colgate
Keepin' that cold case, God, please give me that cold case
Man, I don't want no new friends, forgive me for all of my sins
I don’t wanna think about losin', all I wanna do is win win

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I done put 20 inside the Sig (ya dig)
I pull up on you and I pop at your kid (ya dig)
I pull up to your block and I pop at your wig (ya dig)
I hopped out the Coupe and I'm fresh as a bitch (ya dig, ya dig, ya dig)
Since I was a youngin', I been gettin' dough (ya dig, ya dig)
I count my backend and I turn up the show (ya dig, ya dig)
I want hella Xans, they get me off (ya dig, ya dig)
I put the V neck on my team, yeah (ya dig, ya dig)

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Without the radio, it's 20 a show and that's fo' sho'
Get that back-end, bitch, we buyin' dope, that’s how it go
Black Amigos, bout the Freebandz
That 44., I could cook the dope with no stove
Pot on the floor
Pull up in that coupe shit, nigga like damn, where the roof went?
In the streets, they call me Jay Z, lil bitch, I got the blueprint
No nigga, I don't want no old hunnids, you know I want them blue strips
And I can't fuck you old hoes, I'm ballin' with my new bitch, yeah
You dig that? 200,000 worth of chain and that's a fact
Got my name in this rap game by sellin' crack
Rest in peace to OG Double D, you dig that, slime!

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I done put 20 inside the Sig (ya dig)
I pull up on you and I pop at your kid (ya dig)
I pull up to your block and I pop at your wig (ya dig)
I hopped out the Coupe and I'm fresh as a bitch (ya dig, ya dig, ya dig)
Since I was a youngin' I been gettin' dough (ya dig, ya dig)
I count my backend and I turn up the show (ya dig, ya dig)
I want hella Xans, they get me off (ya dig, ya dig)
I put the V neck on my team, yeah (ya dig, ya dig)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
(Quavo)
Shoot out the coupe (pew-pew)
Shoot out the roof (shoot out the roof)
Pull up and smash on her
We don't got to put a bag on her
I took your ho, ya dig? (ya dig?)
I told her hold the Sig (sig)
Had big bales, midget (big bales)
Now you can't say I ain't got millions (ay!)
Swam with the sharks, water (splash)
You be law and order (12)
I be gettin' money every mornin': Tom Joyner (uh)
I heard you gettin' money
But you payin' em niggas extortin' ya (dig?)
You pay for your fame and fortune (huh)
You pay for your fame and fortune
I am the plug, cordless (brr)
Pull up with blazers, Portland (brr)
I pay the neighbors (cash)
To pick up the dope on they porches (dope, uh)
I came from nickels, I came from Nichols
My niggas don't know you, we do not fuck with you
I've been in the system, I've been in a pickle
You dig me like shovels, I gotta fuck with ya

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I done put 20 inside the Sig (ya dig)
I pull up on you and I pop at your kid (ya dig)

[Verse 4: Offset]
(Offset)
Hop in the private (private)
This is a Lambo, not a hybrid (skrr)
My wrist is a faucet (watch)
Feed 'em perkies, I'm the doctor (doctor)
Draco, 100 round choppa
She got her eyes on me like binoculars (watch!)
Count up this money, it's marvelous (count it up)
Stall the bitch, I don't call the bitch (stallin')
You better dig what I'm sayin' (dig what I'm)
I'ma kill you and your mans (I'ma kill)
Beat down the block like an amp
Goin' up like a skateboard on a ramp (woah)
Go buy the Rollie and bust it (bust it, bust it)
Talkin' that tough shit
But you know you not gon' bust shit (huh, huh)
Look at my fashion
This is a Gucci rugby (look at it, look at it)
I'm trappin' and rappin'
Still got 'em babies in custody
My diamonds be dancin'
Live in a mansion
My life is lovely (My life is lovely)
Ain't no more loyalty
Knock your ass off, pay the lawyer fee (Pow, pow, pow)
Shit can get ugly

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I done put 20 inside the Sig (ya dig)
I pull up on you and I pop at your kid (ya dig)
I pull up to your block and I pop at your wig (ya dig)
I hopped out the Coupe and I'm fresh as a bitch (ya dig, ya dig, ya dig)
Since I was a youngin', I been gettin' dough (ya dig, ya dig)
I count my backend and I turn up the show (ya dig, ya dig)
I want hella Xans, they get me off (ya dig, ya dig)
I put the V neck on my team, yeah (ya dig, ya dig)
(ya dig, ya dig, ya dig)
