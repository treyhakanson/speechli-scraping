Title: Five More Minutes
Artist: Scotty McCreery

[Verse 1]
Eight years old a couple cane poles sitting down by the creek
Our lines in the water watching those bobbers seeing that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yelling "Supper's hot, y'all come and get it!"
We yelled five more minutes
At sixteen it was twelve o three standing at her front door
Katie's dad said midnight, but we needed just a little more
Yellow light flipping on and off, interruptin' that goodnight kissing
We wanted five more minutes

[Chorus]
Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Give myself five more minutes

[Verse 2]
At eighteen, turned my helmet in, and walked to the fifty yard line
It's just the coach and me after we lost state ten to nine
And I cried, "man next time to get in here, I'll have to buy a ticket"
Can't you give me five more minutes

[Chorus]
Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Give myself five more minutes

[Bridge]
At eighty-six my grandpa said there's angels in the room
With all the family gathered 'round we knew that time was coming soon
With so much left to say I prayed Lord I ain't finished
Just give us five more minutes

[Chorus]
Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Yeah sometimes this old life will leave you wishing
That you had five more minutes
Oh five more minutes
