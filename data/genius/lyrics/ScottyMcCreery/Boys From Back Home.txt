Title: Boys From Back Home
Artist: Scotty McCreery

[Verse 1]
We live for bright light Friday night
Front row bleacher packed in tight
Stood there, shirts off in the cold
Painted our faces blue and gold
Yeah win or lose, either way
We'd pile in Will's old Chevrolet
Heading downtown to set up shop
In that drive through cookout parking lot
Ooh
Yeah Rhett had a beard and a fake ID
He'd buy the beer at the old BP
Kyle's folks were gone 'til Sunday night
Sing country roads 'til morning light
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
And I go back in time
To those October nights
And when I hear that song
It don't feel too long
Since things changed and life moved on
But no matter where in this world we roam
We're still them boys from back home

[Verse 2]
Week after graduation day
Old Burt packed up and drove away
Collin bought a diamond ring
And I went to Nashville to chase a dream
Next time I roll through Carolina
I'ma call 'em up to see if we can find
A stop sign to shoot
A train track to jump
Put on Dixieland Delight
And turn it way up

[Chorus]
Yeah I go back in time
To those October nights
And when I hear that song
It don't feel too long
Since things changed and life moved on
But no matter where in this world we roam
We're still them boys from back home, yeah

[Bridge]
Yeah I go back in time
To those October nights

[Chorus]
And I go back in time
To those October nights
And when I hear that song
It don't feel, it don't feel too long
Since things changed and life moved on
And no matter where in this world we roam
We're still them boys from back home
Them boys from back home

Yeah, woo!
