Title: Wherever You Are
Artist: Scotty McCreery

[Verse 1]
Wonder are you on the West Coast
Top down rodeo driving
Maybe up in Colorado
You always did love that Rocky Mountain High
Up in Manhattan or way out in some cabin
In the middle of nowhere
Well baby I'll be there

[Chorus]
Wherever you are wherever it is
Baby it ain't too far
Just give me a call, drop me a pin
Enough of this damn being apart
I'll fill up a tank or buy me a ticket
Whatever it takes you know I'm with it
It won't be long till I'm there by your side
Wherever you are wherever you are tonight

[Verse 2]
Are you hanging in a dive bar
Nodding your head to some eighties cover band
Strolling down some boardwalk
Kicking off your flip flops in the sand
Do you wish I was kissing on your lips
No it won't take much
So baby just hit me up

[Chorus]
Wherever you are wherever it is
Baby it ain't too far
Just give me a call, drop me a pin
Enough of this damn being apart
I'll fill up a tank or buy me a ticket
Whatever it takes you know I'm with it
It won't be long till I'm there by your side
Wherever you are wherever you are tonight

Yeah wherever you are tonight, oh

[Bridge]
Well to tell you the truth
Ain't a day goes by that I don't think about you
And I wish I was on my way to

[Chorus]
Wherever you are wherever it is
Baby it ain't too far
Just give me a call, drop me a pin hit send
Enough of this damn being apart
I'll fill up a tank or buy me a ticket
Whatever it takes you know I'm with it
It won't be long till I'm there by your side
Wherever you are wherever you are tonight

[Outro]
Wherever you are tonight, yeah
Yeah ooh ooh
Yeah ooh ooh
