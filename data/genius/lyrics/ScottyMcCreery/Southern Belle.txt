Title: Southern Belle
Artist: Scotty McCreery

[Verse 1 - Scotty McCreery]
Somewhere down south, there’s a swinging screen door
Sundressed beauty on a hot front porch
Knocking one back, baby, oh my Lord, have mercy
Shooting out gravel, saying "oh, my stars"
She's Dukes of Hazzard in her daddy’s car
Amazing Grace in a Mason jar, have mercy

[Pre-Chorus - Scotty McCreery]
You can go around the block, ‘round the town, ‘round the world
But there's nothing like a down home girl

[Chorus - Scotty McCreery]
Ain't nothing ring like a southern belle
Those angels singing down in the Bible Belt
Well, brother, if loving those sweet tea, blue-jean dreams is wrong
Well, I can't help it
Ain't nothing ring like a southern belle

[Verse 2 - Scotty McCreery]
Saturday night with the red lipstick
Just like Scarlett, she's gone with the wind
Sunday morning with the honey biscuits, have mercy

[Pre-Chorus - Scotty McCreery]
You can go around the block, ‘round the town, ‘round the world
But there's nothing like a down home girl

[Chorus - Scotty McCreery]
Ain't nothing ring like a southern belle
Those angels singing down in the Bible Belt
Well, brother, if loving those sweet tea, blue-jean dreams is wrong
Well, I can't help it
Ain't nothing ring like a southern belle

[Bridge - Scotty McCreery]
Baby, swing low, making me high
Wanna catch your heart like a firefly
Hold on to you for the rest of my life
Have mercy
My baby swinging low; it's making me high
Wanna catch your heart like a firefly
Hold on to you for the rest of my life

[Chorus - Scotty McCreery]
Ain't nothing ring like a southern belle
Those angels singing down in the Bible Belt
Well, brother, if loving those sweet tea, blue-jean dreams is wrong
Well, I can't help it
Ain't nothing ring, no, nothing rings like a southern belle
You can go around the block, ‘round the town, ‘round the world
But there's nothing like a down home girl
Oh, like a southern belle
You can go around the block, ‘round the town, ‘round the world
But there's nothing like a down home girl
Well, brother, if loving those sweet tea, blue-jean dreams is wrong
Guess I'll be wrong with my southern belle
