Title: Feelin' It
Artist: Scotty McCreery

[Verse 1]
(I'm feeling it)
Pop tops popping
Flip-flops flopping
Drop tops dropping down
Ray-Bans raying
Waves are waving
Ladies are laying out
Feeling it

IPods rocking
Sunblock blocking
Igloos stocking up (yep)
Cutoffs are cutting
Worry 'bout nothing
But putting something in my cup (feeling it)

[PreChorus]
And I can't, I can't find nothing wrong
With nothing, nothing that's going on
It's making me wanna sing a song
That goes like this

[Chorus]
Whoa, oh, whoa
Ain't nothing like feeling that summertime feeling
Kicked back, relaxed, just chilling
I'm feeling, I'm feeling it
Whoa, oh, whoa
Ain't nothing like digging that summertime
Digging in the sand, getting tan
With your hand in my hand
I'm feeling it
Oh yeah, I'm feeling it

[Verse 2]
Rip tide ripping
Skim board skimming
Sip, sipping something on ice (fill it up)
Hot gets hotter
Head to the water
Jump into paradise (feeling it)

[PreChorus] + [Chorus]

[Bridge]
Sunset setting
Getting good's getting
Good as it can get
Lip gloss glossing
No more talking
Baby giving me a kiss
(Feeling it)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Pop tops popping
IPods rocking
Flip-flops flopping
Oh, I'm feeling it
