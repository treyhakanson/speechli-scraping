Title: In Between
Artist: Scotty McCreery

[Verse 1]
I'm a little bit a ball cap
Little bit a pearl snap button down shirt
Little bit a big city concrete
But a lot more small town dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see your pretty eyes
Reading me like a map
Wondering who I am
And where I'm at

[Chorus]
I'm in between
Friday night wild
And quiet Sunday morning
Between
Done after one
And keep on pouring
Ain't too high
Ain't too low
Just holding down the middle
I'm steady as I go
I ain't all holy water
And I ain't all Jim Beam
I'm somewhere in between

[Verse 2]
I can be a steel toe work boot
40 hour blue collar, mud on my jeans
Then on weekend pack a bag
Disappear kick back on a white sand beach

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a far cry from being
A one night stand
But I ain't ready
For a ring on my hand

[Chorus]
I'm in between
Friday night wild
And quiet Sunday morning
Between
Done after one
And keep on pouring
Ain't too high
Ain't too low
Just holding down the middle
I'm steady as I go
I ain't all holy water
And I ain't all Jim Beam
I'm somewhere in between

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see your pretty eyes
Reading me like a map
Wondering who I am
And where I'm at

[Chorus]
I'm in between
Friday night wild
And quiet Sunday morning
Between
Done after one
And keep on pouring
Ain't too high
Ain't too low
Just holding down the middle
I'm steady as I go
I ain't all holy water
And I ain't all Jim Beam
I'm somewhere in between
Yeah I'm somewhere in between
