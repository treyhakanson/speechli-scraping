Title: Drunk on You
Artist: Luke Bryan

[Verse 1]
Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, four wheel drivesiIn a tail light circle
Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a dixie cup
Get the party started

[Chorus]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

[Verse 2]
If you ain't a 10, you're a 9.9
Tippin' n' spillin' that home-made wine
On your tied up T-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Throwin' little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God almighty

[Chorus]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

[Bridge]
Let's slip on out where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off on out in the water

[Chorus]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm a little drunk on you
