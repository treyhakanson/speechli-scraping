Title: Forever Country
Artist: Artists Of Then, Now & Forever

[Verse 1: Brad Paisley, Keith Urban, Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue ridge mountain, Shenandoah river
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze

[Chorus 1: Little Big Town, Luke Bryan, Miranda Lambert
Blake Shelton & George Strait]
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

[Verse 2: Kacey Musgraves, Eric Church, Ronnie Milsap, Charley Pride, Dierks Bentley & Trisha Yearwood]
If I should stay
All my memories, they gather round her
I would only be in your way
A miner's lady, stranger to blue water
So I'll go, but I know
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
I'll think of you every step of the way
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

[Chorus 1: Lady Antebellum, Blake Shelton, George Strait, Darius Rucker & Martina McBride]
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
(I will always love you)
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

[Bridge: Jason Aldean, Rascal Flatts & Willie Nelson]
On the road again
Like a band of gypsies, we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way

[Chorus 1: Brooks and Dunn, Alabama, Darius Rucker, Little Big Town, Brett Eldredge & Keith Urban]
Country roads (Country roads), take me home (Take me home)
To the place I belong
(I will always love you)
West Virginia, mountain mama
(Will always love you)
Oh, take her home, country roads

[Verse 3: Reba McEntire, Alan Jackson & Vince Gill]
Oh, I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
I wish you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love

[Chorus 2: Carrie Underwood, Brad Paisley, Martina McBride, Little Big Town, Dierks Bentley, Kacey Musgraves, Trisha Yearwood, Tim McGraw, Alan Jackson, Luke Bryan, Keith Urban, Faith Hill, Eric Church, Brett Eldredge, Ronnie Milsap, Reba McEntire, Miranda Lambert & Dolly Parton]
And I will always love you
I will always love you
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, country roads
And I will always love you
On the road again
I will always love you
I just can't wait to get on the road again
Country roads
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
I will always love you
I can't wait to get on the road again
Take me home, country roads
I will always love you
I'll always love you
