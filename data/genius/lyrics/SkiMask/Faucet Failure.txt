Title: Faucet Failure
Artist: Ski Mask the Slump God

[Intro]
Woah, Heh
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney!
Bitch be for real, huh

[Verse 1]
Let's make a deal, bitch be for real
Is you off a pill? Okay
Let’s make a deal, Rumpelstiltskin (Hm)
She wanna see my purple pickle up in the wind (Okay!)
Chancletas off, bitch get in (Ayy, ayy)
And if your nigga don't like me, hit chinny-chin-chin (Huh)
Bitch, I'm hotter than a pepper, no mint (Huh)
Big stepper, no stilts, big tilt, uh
1K, bought my bitch a new kilt, uh (Yup)
New skirt, I skrrt, big drift, uh (Yup)
New grills, 10K, big lisp, uh
Diamonds dancin’ on my fist, no disc, uh
Gimme lips, rock band like KISS, uh
Remember days, me and X hittin' licks

[Chorus]
Guantanamera, we hit a lick on your bitch
I'm a Goodfella, Maison Margiela my kick, uh
I am faucet failure, my nigga, I got drip, uh
Ashin' on your bitch, this that Pokémon trainer shit, uh
Who's this? He should be in cockpit, uh
'Cause I'm flyer than a fuckin' ostrich, uh (Okay)
On my wood, that bitch won’t give me polish, uh
I’ma put my foot up in it, sock it
Who's this? He should be in cockpit, uh
’Cause I'm flyer than a fuckin' ostrich, uh
On my wood, that bitch won't give me polish, huh
I am constructor, that bitch I demolish, ayy

[Verse 2]
Yes give me, a girl from Disney
And a Happy Meal, pretty please don’t gyp me
On fries (Ketchup!), on the guys, uh-huh
McDonalds 'cause they still sellin' pies, uh-huh
Just bought a new suit, got mob ties, uh-huh
Said he want beef, pull up, Five Guys, uh-huh
Yes I'm fire, lil' different like pumpkin fries
Um, hol' up, uh, where's my weed guys? (Huh?)

[Chorus]
Guantanamera, we hit a lick on your bitch
I'm a Goodfella, Maison Margiela my kick, uh
I am faucet failure, my nigga, I got drip, uh
Ashin' on your bitch, this that Pokémon trainer shit, uh
Who's this? He should be in cockpit, uh
'Cause I'm flyer than a fuckin' ostrich, uh
On my wood, that bitch won't give me polish, uh
I'ma put my foot up in it, sock it
Who's this? He should be in cockpit, uh
'Cause I'm flyer than a fuckin' ostrich, uh
On my wood, that bitch won't give me polish, huh
I am constructor, that bitch I demolish, ayy

[Outro]
