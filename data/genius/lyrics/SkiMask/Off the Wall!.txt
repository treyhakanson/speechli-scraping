Title: Off the Wall!
Artist: Ski Mask the Slump God


[Intro: Slipknot & $ki Mask "The Slump God"]
Since you never gave a damn in the first place
Cigarettes, haha
Maybe it's time you had the tables turned
'Cause in the interest of all involved I got the problem solved
Off the pink, off the drink
And the verdict is guilty
Man nearly kill-
Ayy ayy ayy, ohh, huh
Ayy ayy ayy, ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy!

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I feel like Nick Cannon 'cause I'm wildin' out
I don't got on Vans, but bitch, I'm off the wall
I feel like Nick Cannon 'cause I'm wildin' out
I don't got on Vans, but bitch, I'm off the wall
I said like insect, I be buggin' motherfucker
Fuck on your mommy
My flow be sick like that bitch gotta vomit, to vomit, to vomit
I'm hot like a comet
Insect, I be buggin' motherfucker
Fuck on your mommy
My flow be sick like that bitch gotta vomit, to vomit, to vomit
I'm hot like a comet

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
When I di-di-di-di-di-dick that bitch
And she see Jesus on some rapture shit
Throw my balls at her Pokémon
Ash Ketchum shit
Cause I'm fly like a newborn baby wombat wing
Me and this mic is your Mortal Kombat team
I want some head, I'm thinkin' how zombies think
Beaming a pistol it look like hadouken
Like mayday, mayday, mayday, mayday
Tell these pussy rappers that it's time to vacay
Rob your lady
Told her put her hands up high in the air
Like she 'bout to hit the Nae Nae
They say I'm cr-cr-cr-cr-cray cray
Can't control the nigga like we shootin' from the AK
But I kill these rappers
I’m a walking, breathing payday
Hot, but I swag, still nigga got the Ray Rays
Get away, get away, get away, get away
Better do you or do way way, fade away
You sippin' Haterade, I'm sippin' Gatorade
With the lean in it and I call it the fadeaway
I'm so toxic, frog, hop up on my dick
I think I'm a pilot, 'cause she in my cockpit
Plumber, uh, pipe it
Get face like I Skyped it
Did her ASAP like Rocky
Rockin' in my motherfuckin'
Rockin' rockin' in my motherfuckin'

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I feel like Nick Cannon 'cause I'm wildin' out
I don't got on Vans, but bitch, I'm off the wall
Huh, feel like Nick Cannon 'cause I'm wildin' out
I don't got on Vans, but bitch, I'm off the wall
I said like insect, I be buggin' motherfucker
Fuck on your mommy
My flow be sick like that bitch gotta vomit, to vomit, to vomit
I'm hot like a comet
Insect, I be buggin' motherfucker
Fuck on your mommy
My flow be sick like that bitch gotta vomit, to vomit, to vomit
I'm hot like a comet

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
When I fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-fist that bitch
I'ma make that booty jiggle like some kick back, bitch
She gon' rub my Dragon Balls, let her make one wish, what is that?
She just wanna take the young dagger dick
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
She off the Molly, she wanna take seven dick
Body to body, it's MC dagger, bitch
Think that I'm Illuminati because I got money, bitch
Like Ray J, Ray J, Ray J, Ray J
Bitch, I hit it first, on my weenie, hit the nae-nae
Coming in hot like a missile, pussy, hey bae
Falcon punch that nigga, make 'em up, up, and away, ayy
Watch this, uppercut; Super Smash Melee
I just made her spin on my dick like a Beyblade
I'm green like a spinach, I don't know you, then it's pay,-aye!
Hummanah hummana, back fist, out my way, ayy
No Chris Brown, fuck her, make her look at me now
When I'm in the pussy, say "Ow!"
You got no etiquette, just beginning like Genesis
Can you give me a rapper that I'm not better than, mmph? (Ayy!)
Revenge jeans, I think I might OD on sauce, I don't rock Supreme
Suck my dick, Squidward's clarinet
Brought to life like I’m Evanescence, wanna wake, w-w-wake, w-w-w-wake, okay, like
Big black, dick in your mama mouth
Pull it back, push her whole wig back
Tic tac, your breath really P-U
Yo, you really need a Tic-Tac
Big pump, Cobain, Cobain
Leave a pussy nigga with no brain, okay
Weenie Hut Jr. looking boy, tell him "Ole"
I'ma pull that pistol, make 'em Mr. Noodle, aye

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I feel like Nick Cannon 'cause I'm wildin' out
I don't got on Vans, but bitch, I'm off the wall
Huh, feel like Nick Cannon 'cause I'm wildin' out
I don't got on Vans, but bitch, I'm off the wall
I said like insect, I be buggin' motherfucker
Fuck on your mommy
My flow be sick like that bitch gotta vomit, to vomit, to vomit
I'm hot like a comet
Insect, I be buggin' motherfucker
Fuck on your mommy
My flow be sick like that bitch gotta vomit, to vomit, to vomit
I'm hot like a comet
