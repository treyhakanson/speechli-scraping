[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Round one, fight
Yeah, yeah
The Pharmacy
Uh-uh

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Like a tongue, bitch, I'm looking like a lick, uh-uh
Think I'm Thanos, rock diamond my fist, uh-uh
Entertainment with your bitch at night like Nick
Drake and Josh how we team your bitch, uh-uh
Michael Jackson, one glove, I hit, uh-huh
Crying in the club with my stick, uh-huh
Icky Vicky spit, how I got slimes on deck
Metal on me like they just flicked Bic, uh-huh
Two girls, two cups, know I had to level up
Ate a Mario mushroom quick, uh-huh
Know these niggas be chickens like a nugget
They be just actors, Denzel Washington, uh-huh
I'ma play the saddest song on the smallest violin (Haha)
For the niggas in my scrap bin, uh-huh
Maybe we could get along, maybe we could be friends
In another fuckin' life, my friend, uh-huh (Yeah)

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Cutthroat, cutthroat, cutthroat
They be on my nuts though, nuts though, nuts though
'Cause I don't give a fuck, ho, fuck, ho, fuck, ho
I might be around squirrels 'cause a nigga is a nut, ho

[Verse 2: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Um, this that
Yes I got the bacon saturated, fuckin' pig fat
I'm not skinny dippin', big drippin', bitch, big facts (Gosh damn)
Uh, Chief Keef that pussy, bang bang
Pretty please don't act like me and you is the fucking same thing
Yes nigga, I switch the flow to unorthodox, gang gang (Ayy, ayy ayy)
They tryna bite like a vampire fang (Gosh damn)
Diamonds water, bendin' like the nigga Aang
Intelligence is only for the gentlemen
So tell the pussy niggas, "Yes, Trix for kids" (Uh-huh)
That's a fact like a Snapple cap tip (Straight up)
Lame niggas sayin' that they fuckin' demons
No wonder that they lost up in the sauce in this bitch
I ain't never need a false deity
Give me power or do a damn thing for me, bitch
When I'm acting like a monster like Stitch
You be acting like a bitch, so I call you sis (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Switcharoo your bitch, uh-huh
This is what I call an assist, uh-huh
Tell 'em this ain't that, and that ain't this
With a flick of my wrist, uh-huh, yeah

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God & Juice WRLD]
Cutthroat, cutthroat, cutthroat
They be on my nuts though, nuts though, nuts though
'Cause I don't give a fuck, ho, fuck, ho, fuck, ho (I don't give a fuck, bitch)
I might be around squirrels 'cause a nigga is a nut, ho (What? Yeah)

[Verse 3: Juice WRLD]
Cutthroat, love it when they run, ho (What)
Knife on the AK, stab 'em with a gun, ho
Hoppin' in that mosh pit, I was tryna rage shit
It's a different day, it's like niggas on the same shit, I hate it
Rich like a white bitch, I should go blonde, bitch
I put my dick up in your mom, bitch
You ain't on shit dot-com, bitch
Desert Eagle, take his head off, make it fly like a comet
Glizzy crank your ass like Soulja Boy, screamin', "Yah, bitch"
Wanna fuck a nigga bitch, uh-huh (What else?)
Grant a bullet like a wish, uh-huh (What else?)
D-Rose when I drive through the paint
With the foul, I'ma still get a swish, uh-huh (Uh)
What the fuck bro?
You ain't tryna fuck, get the fuck out my spot, ho
'Fore your ass get kicked out like a thot, ho (Whoa)

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Cutthroat, cutthroat, cutthroat
They be on my nuts though, nuts though, nuts though
'Cause I don't give a fuck, ho, fuck, ho, fuck, ho
I might be around squirrels 'cause a nigga is a nut, ho

[Outro: Juice WRLD]
Yeah, water
Uh, pipe me up, voot me up, fuck nigga
Uh, uh, evil twin, ayy ayy, uh
Ayy ayy, cutthroat
