Title: Catch Me Outside
Artist: Ski Mask the Slump God


[Intro]
Shout-out, my mucus (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
'Cause you know that be my slime
(Ayy, catch me outside)
Shout-out, my mucus
That nigga, that be my slime
That nigga, that be my slime sli-sli-slime sli-sli-slime slime
Ayy, what? (Watch this pussy)
Ayy, ayy, okay!

[Verse 1]
Naruto nine-tailed fox coat fur
I feel like a Gucci ad-lib, burr!
Colder than Coca-Cola mascot, polar bear
Put my sauce on lasagna it could make Garfield purr (Prr)
I ain't really fuckin' with these niggas like a d*** (Water!)
New Kellogg's tiger I tell 'em earn yo' stripes
You tryna be me but bih, could never in your life (Never)
Even if you had on my sneakers like Bow Wow in Like Mike
Like Gotti, nigga, watch me be disgusting
I'ma do 'em dirty like a ringworm ring
Why they be talkin' like they might know something?
I'm Madagascar, I'm royalty like Lemur King
Told her be careful, my penis just like limousine
And I donâ€™t want to eat pussy if it just smell like Hennessy
Star Wars confederate rifle shoot like ray-beam
Watch me spin around 360 quick scope or something

[Bridge]
Ayy, yuh, ayy (Water!)
Ayy ayy, ayy ayy ayy (Huh)
It's Doktor Avalanche
(Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it!)

[Chorus]
Okay like
Bills on me blue, uh-huh (Sing it)
Like a bruise, uh-huh (Sing it)
Better yet, uh-huh, Blue's Clues (Sing it, sing it, sing it)
Bills on me blue, uh-huh (Sing it)
Like a bruise, uh-huh (Sing it)
Better yet, uh-huh, Blue's Clues (Sing it, sing it, sing it)
Bills on me blue, huh
Bruise, huh
Better yet, uh, Blue's Clues
Bills on me blue, uh-huh
Like a bruise, uh-huh
Better yet, mhm, Blue's Clues

[Verse 2]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, woah Nelly
Go and shake that ass like it's vibration on my celly
Ayy, ayy, ayy, woah mama
Diamonds on me fatter than Peter Griffin's big stomach
Stove on me too, uh-huh, old news, uh-huh
Cook a nigga, uh-huh, like stew
They say my flow that gas, might burp, excuse you, uh-huh
Where I'm going, oh, I think your bitch pums
Excuse me don't fumble it
Drive where yo' momma live
She gon' stumble on my dick like Jack and Jill on the hill
White on me, Jonah Hill
Heard of my gang and them
I'ma beat that pussy till it's black as Ms. Lauryn Hill
That's all folks, uh-huh
Looney Tunes, uh-huh
Mink fur pink like the ass on baboon, like
Where You Will Regret? Uh-huh, comin' soon
When that bitch drop, uh-huh, then toodaloo

[Bridge]
Ayy, yuh, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, water!
Ayy, ayy, ayy
It's Doktor Avalanche
(Sauce, wet, flex)

[Chorus]
Okay like
Bills on me blue, uh-huh
Like a bruise, uh-huh
Better yet, uh-huh, Blue's Clues
Bills on me blue, uh-huh
Like a bruise, uh-huh
Better yet, uh-huh, Blue's Clues
Bills on me blue, huh
Bruise, huh
Better yet, uh, Blue's Clues
Bills on me blue, uh-huh
Like a bruise, uh-huh
Better yet, mhm, Blue's Clues

[Outro]
