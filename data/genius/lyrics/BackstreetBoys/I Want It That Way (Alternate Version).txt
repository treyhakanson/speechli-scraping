Title: I Want It That Way (Alternate Version)
Artist: Backstreet Boys

[Verse 1: Brian]
I'm yours completely
I feel so deeply
You're my first thought every day
And I want it that way

[Verse 2: Nick]
My life is for you
And I adore you
I love you more everyday
And I want it that way

[Chorus]
No goodbyes
Ain't nothing but a heartache
No more lies
Ain't nothing but a mistake
That is why
I love it when I hear you say
I want it that way

[Verse 3: AJ]
My heart is on fire
Such a strong desire
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way

[Chorus]
No goodbyes
Ain't nothing but a heartache
No more lies
Ain't nothing but a mistake
That is why
I love it when I hear you say
I want it that way

[Bridge: Kevin]
I gave you my heart
Baby right from the start
And that's the way it will always be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

[Middle 8: Howie]
You are my fire
The one desire
You are (you are, you are, you are)

[Nick]
Don't want to hear you say

[Chorus (w/ Nick)]
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Ain't nothing but a mistake (I wanna hear you say)
I love it when I hear you say (oh yeah)
You want it that way

[Chorus (w/AJ, Brian & Nick)]
(No goodbyes)
Ain't nothing but a heartache
(No more lies)
Ain't nothing but a mistake
That is why
I love it when I hear you say
(I wanna hear you say)
I want it that way

[Chorus (w/Brian & AJ)]
(No goodbyes)
[Chorus]
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Ain't nothing but a mistake
That is why
I love it when I hear you say
(Love it when I hear you say)
I want it that way

[Outro: AJ]
'Cause I want it that way
