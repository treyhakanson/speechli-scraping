Title: I Want It That Way
Artist: Backstreet Boys

[Intro: Brian]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Brian & Nick]
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

[Chorus: Nick & All]
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way

[Verse 2: AJ, with Brian]
Am I your fire?
Your one desire
Yes, I know it's too late
But I want it that way

[Chorus: AJ, All & Brian]
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way

[Bridge: Kevin]
Now I can see that we're falling apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance, I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

[Interlude: Howie]
You are my fire
The one desire
You are, you are, you are, you are

[Bridge: Nick & All]
Don't wanna hear you say
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake (don't wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say (oh, yeah)
I want it that way

[Chorus: Brian, All, (Nick) & AJ]
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say (don't want to hear you say)
I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

[Outro: AJ]
'Cause I want it that way
