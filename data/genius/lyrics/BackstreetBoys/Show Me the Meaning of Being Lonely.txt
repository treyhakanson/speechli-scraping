Title: Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely
Artist: Backstreet Boys

[Intro]
Show me the meaning of being lonely

[Verse 1: Brian]
So many words for the broken heart
It is hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe

[Verse 2: AJ]
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

[Chorus: All]
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are
There is something missing in my heart

[Verse 3: Kevin]
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze upon me

[Verse 4: Nick]
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There is no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done, they tell me

[Chorus: All]
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are
There is something missing in my heart

[Bridge: Howie, All & Brian]
There is nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be you are asking me
To feel the things you never show?
You are missing in my heart
Tell me why cannot I be there where you are?

[Chorus: All]
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are
There is something missing in my heart
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are
There is something missing in my heart
