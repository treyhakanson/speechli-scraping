Title: Chances
Artist: Backstreet Boys

[Verse 1: Brian]
What if I never run into you?
What if you never smiled at me?
What if I had noticed you too?
And you never showed up where I happened to be

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
On a quiet night, what are the odds?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
I could have just walked by, who would have thought?

[Chorus: Brian]
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?

[Verse 2: AJ]
What if I hadn't asked for your name?
And time hadn't stopped when you said it to me? Oh
Of all of the plans that I could have made
Of all of the nights that I couldn't sleep, oh

[Pre-Chorus: AJ and Nick]
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
In a crowded room, what are the odds?
(What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?)
Getting close to you, but here we are

[Chorus: Nick]
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
That I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?

[Bridge: Howie and Kevin]
Is it love? Is it fate?
Who am I? Who's to say?
Don't know exactly what it means (Ooh, oh, yeah)
''Is it love? Is it fate?''
''Where it leads, who can say?''
''Maybe you and I were meant to be''

[Chorus: Nick and Brian]
What, what
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Two in a million, once in a life
That I could have found you, put my arms around you (My arms around you)
Two in a million (It's like two in a million), once in a life, yeah (Woah)
What are the chances? (What are the chances?)
Two in a million, once in a life
What are the chances? (What are the chances?)
Two in a million, once in a life

[Outro: Brian]
What if I never run into you?
And what if you never smiled at me?
