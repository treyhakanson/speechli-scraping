Title: God, Your Mama, and Me
Artist: Florida Georgia Line

[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
That Sunday morning choir calling, church doors open wide
That hallelujah, shoot right through ya, make you feel alive
That key under the mat, you know right where it's at
It's waiting with the porch light on
Don't bother calling, no need for knocking, just come on home
Come on home, my love is

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & Backstreet Boys]
Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me

[Verse 2: Nick Carter]
Loud as shotgun, angels singing with the radio
Praying with you every mile down any dead end road
You can tell me every secret that you been keeping
I'll hold it, lock and key
Up with you all night, holding you all night, I never leave
You better believe my love is

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & Backstreet Boys]
Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me
You better believe it, you better believe it

[Bridge: AJ McLean]
Every step you take, I'll be as sure as your shadow
Every move you make, you know I'll follow you wherever you go
Baby, you know my love is

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & Backstreet Boys]
Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally (unconditionally)
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me

[Outro: Florida Georgia Line & Backstreet Boys]
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God your mama, and me
