[Chorus: Quavo]
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Take my shoes and walk a mile, somethin' that you can't do (woo, hey)
Big talks of the town, big boy gang moves (gang moves)
I like to walk around wit' my chain loose (chain, chain)
She just bought a new ass but got the same boobs (same boobs)
Whippin' up dope, scientist
(Whip it up, whip it up, cook it up, cook it up, skrr, skrr)
That's my sauce, where you find it?
(That's my sauce, look it up, look it up, find it)
Addin' up checks, no minus
(Add it up, add it up, add it up, add it up, yeah)
Get your respect in diamonds (ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice)
I bought a Plain Jane Rollie, these niggas bought they fame (woo)
I think my back got scoliosis 'cause I swerve the lane (skrr)
Heard you signed your life for that brand new chain (I heard)
Think it came with stripes but you ain't straight with the gang (gang, gang)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it)
Walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it)
Walk it like I talk it (let's go)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (hey)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayy, I gotta stay in my zone
Say that we been beefin' dog, but you on your own
First night, she gon' let me fuck 'cause we grown
I hit her, gave her back to the city, she home (she at home now)
That was that
So I can't be beefin' with no wack nigga, got no backbone
Heard you livin' in a mansion in all your raps though
But your shit look like the trap on this Google Maps, though
We been brothers since Versace bando, woah
Name ringin' like a Migo trap phone, woah
Used to be with Vashtie at Santo's
That's on Tommy Campos, we live like Sopranos and I—

[Chorus: Quavo]
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it)
Walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it)
Walk it like I talk it (let's go)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (hey)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it

[Verse 3: Offset]
Woo, woo, woo, Offset
Niggas pocket watchin' (watchin')
I want that thot, this thot, ménagin' (which one?)
I bought a franchise to double up the profits (franchise)
We make a landslide, chopper get to poppin' (landslide)
Eliott got me rocky
Blow a socket, chicken teriyaki (brr)
Take off rocket, keep 'em in pocket
Water gon' lock it, quadruple the profit (profit)
I walk like I walk (hey) talk like I talk (woah)
What’s in my vault? Load of cash and assaults (brr)
I put a lab in my loft (lab)
She cook up and jab with the fork (jab)
By the pair, I got karats that choke (by the pair)
By the pair, I got karats each lobe (by the pair)
Private life, private jets 'round the globe (private life)
Hit a bitch, hit a lick with the 'cho (hey)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it)
Walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it)
Walk it like I talk it (let's go)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (hey)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Watch it buck, no Milwaukee (hunnid)
Walk it, like I talk it
That's my bro, he know the lingo (lingo)
Ain't no walkie-talkie (no)
This some, "You know, why don't we know?" (We know?)
Hold out on that coffee
Smoke the cookie, get the coughin'
Drop dead fresh, I need a coffin
Ballin', somethin' we do often (ball)
Take the pot and I'm splashin' up, dolphin (splash)
Take the nine and go buy me a faucet (nine)
Walkin' like I talk a nigga done bought it (uh)
I play the coach so I gotta call it (call it)
Up in the shits, some niggas just dormant (shits)
Walk in the buildin', they start applaudin' (applaudin')
I get a rebound, ain't talkin' 'bout Spalding (ball)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it)
Walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it)
Walk it like I talk it (let's go)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it like I talk it (woo)
Walk it like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (hey)
Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
