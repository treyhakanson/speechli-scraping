In Italy, bought her a fur, look like the wildebeast (wrarr)
Just chill with me (chill)
It is no worry, it is a bill to me (it ain't nothin')
I pull up Diablo, I pull up with models
I gave her her first Philippe (Philippe)
We goin' full throttle, she swallowed the bottle
I'm all in her ovaries (eghhh)
I gave her some dollars
I Gucci'd her collar, now she can't get over me (hey)
She want a dose of me (dose)
Just hop in the Ghost with me (Ghost)
Perky and molly, don't vote for nobody
These bitch ass niggas ain't solid (solid)
Run in your house and with pumps and the shotties
Your mama might be up inside it (bah)
Cars robotic, bad bitch with a body
But really don't care nothing about it (uh-uh)
Cappin' and poppin', I seen that lil' Masi

It's a jungle, I let 'em survive (survive)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Pop a perky just to start up (pop it, pop it)
Pop two cups of purple just to warm up (two cups, drank)

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I rock water, diamonds, I'm drippin' but not slippin'
I threw a quarter (well damn) but nawl, I'm not trippin'
Bugatti on Forgis, and nawl, I'm not crippin'
I buy Ferraris like Jordans, I'm Mike and y'all Pippen
Chillin', just me and my millions
Niggas, they all in they feelin's
My bitches, I spoil them like they chillens
So persistent, if I want it, I go get it
I'm so slimy, grimy, shiesty but still shinin'
Rude and unkindly, cruel with no conscience
Drop the top on College, nigga, I ain't with no-nonsense
And I'm a murderer, nigga, but I don't promote violence

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Dead shot (brrt) AK make your head rock (brrt)
Red dot (pewpew), retro Air Jord' deadstock (-stock)
Lean on rocks (Act) perkys, mollies, xannies, rocks (roxies)
Oxycontin (oxyies) Takeoff, I'm your med doc (Takeoff!)
Leg lock (leg) the key I got unlock the box (box)
What's in that box (huh?). Don't tell 'em, they might show the cops (shh)
Wristwatch (bite) abnormal so I flood the clock (ice)
Money flop, panties drop, that's when them titties pop (woo)
Free my partners (John Wick)
'Til they free it's fuck the cops (fuck 'em)
They know I geek a lot
They don't know I keep a Glock (clueless)
Ain't been no drought (where)
They think I been sleep a lot
They think I'm dumb (dumb)
They don't know I see the plot (see it)
Fuck it I seize a knot

[Chorus: Quavo]
Pop a perky just to start up (pop it, pop it)
Pop two cups of purple just to warm up (two cups, drank)
I heard your bitch, she got that water
(Splash, drip, drip, woo, splash, aye)
Slippery (wow), 'scuse me, please me (please)
Arm up (up), oh, believe me, believe me (believe me)
Get beat (beat), 'cause I'm flexin' 'Rari's (skrt)
You can bet on me (skr, skr, hey, hey, hey)
