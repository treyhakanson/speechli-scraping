[Chorus: Quavo]
Bentley truck, yeah, that's my choice of ride (skrrt skrrt)
Always keep some bitches on the side, yeah, yeah
Don't stand too close, my diamonds gonna bite (bling)
I get drugs for the right price, yeah, yeah (drugs)
She gon' eat this molly like it's rice (eat it up)
I'ma let that lean flow through my ice (lean, lean)
Said she never had a Migo night (no)
I'ma make her sing like Kelly Price (sing!)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
My ice, Klondike, ride around, dough right (yeah)
Ride around, get right, get rich, good night (oeh)
Good night (good night)
My bitch (bitch) for real, she honest, won't tell (oh)
Popeye's, oatmeals, Popeye's and oatmeal (ayy)
She gon' kill, yeah (pew pew pew pew pew pew)
I go through all the cities (yeah)
I'm on a mile a minute (uh)

You wanna play violent? Let's get it (yeah)
Take me back to the old days (old)
Take me back to my old ways (old)
Lifestyle, yeah, the gang way (gang)
Way before they called me Sensei
Get robbed in the driveway (robbed)
Bad bitches, they was not here
You were prolly watching Garfield (hey)
Tunnel vision and nothin' else
Kick door, that's on our face (door)
I done walk in the hallway
Basketball then gunplay (prrr)
Young niggas didn't graduate
You probably think I couldn't make it (I made it)
It's all good God saved me (God)
Now I'm doin' what I wanna
Bentley truck bent the corner (skrt skrt, skrt skrt, skrt skrt)
Niggas bite like piranhas (bite)
If I gotta put the bag on 'em, I'ma pay 'em all hundreds

[Chorus: Quavo]

Treat the Bentley truck like a Jag'
Got the red and blues on my ass
Got lethal, narcs, lethal, darts
My bitch got lethal, parts, a lethal heart
All my furniture same color, molly tan (molly tan)
You wanna go to heaven, grab my hand (grab my hand)
She gon' suck me dry until we land (yeah!)
I'ma call on squad like, "What's the plans?" (it's lit!)
We been rockin', geekin', goin' all night (skrt, skrt)

Woke up, cocaine all in my hair, thought it was lice, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
No key, push button auto, start my ride (ride)
Two piece chicken wing without the fries (fries)
If I pop the seal and drink it, you gon' drive (drive)
If you let me in and I like, I change your life (change)
Back it up, back it up, back it up, alright (alright)
We go try something different just for tonight (try)
Tear the tab and I paid the price (price)
Just take me there I might roll the dice (ah)
With a blindfold, I could still whip up a pie (pie)
Never leave and go nowhere without the fire (brrr)
If you cashed out on that Bentley Truck say "I" (I)
Plus another car that's on my ice (yeah yeah)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Bentley truck, yeah, that's my choice of ride (choice of ride, yeah, skrrt skrrt)

[Outro: Quavo & Travis Scott]
My choice of ride (my choice of ride)

Yeah, yeah, she gon' eat this molly like it's rice

I black out, I black out too
