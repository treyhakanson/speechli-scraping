Title: Oh Me Oh My
Artist: DJ Snake

[Intro: G4SHI]
Yeah, shutdown
Whoo, shutdown
Ayy

[Chorus: G4SHI]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I just shut the club down, I ain't even try
See them rollin' with me, yeah, they ride or die
Test us and I guarantee we let it fly
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I just shut the club down, I ain't even try
I always tell the truth, boy, I ain't gotta lie
If you ain't fuckin' with us, don't come to our side

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Oh my, oh me, oh my, I know these niggas some small fries (oh my!)
Oh me, oh my, I serve a nigga like it's Five Guys (serve 'em!)
Lil' bitty bitch with the brown eyes (bitch!)
She cook up the dope a million times (whip!)
And it come back to me a trillion times (come on back)
Birds singin' just like Ginuwine
Independent, never signin' (independent!)
Bitch I bought my own diamonds (bitch I did)
Case a nigga, move in silence (case a nigga!)
I met my plug on the island (plug)
Young nigga hot in designer (hot!)
Feds watchin', they can't find me (12)
We make the birds take a shower (shower!)
Free my niggas in confinement (free my niggas!)
These niggas lookin' like cowards
Mama said don't fuck with you, boy, you sour (mama!)
The way that I play with the white
You'd think that a nigga be cookin' with flour (white!)
Got a sniper in the tower (rrow)
Money bring more power (ayy)
I got a sniper in the tower (rrow)
He been up for 24 hours

[Chorus: G4SHI & Travis Scott]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I just shut the club down, I ain't even try
See them rollin' with me, yeah, they ride or die
Test us and I guarantee we let it fly
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I just shut the club down, I ain't even try
I always tell the truth, boy, I ain't gotta lie
If you ain't fuckin' with us, don't come to our side (straight up)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Come from the club around 3:30
I've been up in it, go James Worthy
I've been up, goin' up, way up
Thinkin' about it all day, fuck
How many more could fit in the ride?
Hit me, I'll pull up on any side
All of my niggas on M
All of my bitches off M
Open, open up, baby
You know that I'm goin', goin', goin', goin' right now
Hundred bottles, we get poppin' right now
Smokin', don't you choke on dopest right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh me, oh my, homie, don't try
Won't you come home for a ride?
We can do this for the night

[Chorus: G4SHI]
Oh me, oh me oh my
I just shut the club down, I ain't even try
See them rollin' with me, yeah they ride or die
Test us and I guarantee we let it fly
Oh me, oh me oh my
I just shut the club down, I ain't even try
I always tell the truth, boy, I ain't gotta lie
If you ain't fuckin' with us, don't come to our side

[Bridge: Quavo]
If you not fuckin' with us
If you not fuckin' with us
Then say you not fuckin' with us
We don't wanna fuck with that fake shit
We don't wanna fuck with that fake shit
We don't wanna fuck with that fake shit
If you not fuckin' with us
Then young nigga don't even say that shit
If you not fuckin' with us
You know that we don't even play that shit
Then you the one we can't trust
You'll be the one we can't trust
You'll be the one we can't trust
If you not fuckin' with us

[Outro: G4SHI]
Test us and I guarantee we let it fly
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I just shut the club down, I ain't even try
I always tell the truth, boy, I ain't gotta lie
If you ain't fuckin' with us, don't come to our side
