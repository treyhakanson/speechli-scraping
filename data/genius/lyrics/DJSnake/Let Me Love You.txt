Title: Let Me Love You
Artist: DJ Snake

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I used to believe
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful
Sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle
On a miracle

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby

[Breakdown: DJ Snake]

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Don't fall asleep
At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough yeah
Know we're good enough

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Say go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby

[Breakdown: DJ Snake]

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby
