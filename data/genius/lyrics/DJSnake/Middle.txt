Title: Middle
Artist: DJ Snake

[Verse 1]
Starin' at two different views on your window ledge
Coffee is going cold, it's like time froze
There you go wishin', floatin' down our wishin' well
It's like I'm always causin' problems, causin' hell
I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell
We cannot sweep this under the carpet

[Chorus]
I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world for us two
With you in the middle

[Break]
(With you in the middle)
(With you in the middle)

[Verse 2]
Lyin' down beside you, what's goin' through your head?
The silence in the air felt like my soul froze
Am I just overthinking feelings I conceal?
This gut feeling I'm tryna get off me as well
I hope we find our missin' pieces and just chill
We cannot sweep it under the carpet

[Chorus]
I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world for us two
With you in the middle

[Break]
(With you in the middle)
(With you in the middle)
(With you)

[Outro]
(You)
站在中间，有谁站在中间
(You)
站在中间，有谁站在中间
