Title: Creep On Me
Artist: GASHI

[Verse 1: GASHI]
My heart going up and down when it’s you I see
All these girls so salty cause you’re so sweet
You ain’t the one that I want, you the one I need
Telling your friends that you’re really not in love with me

[Pre-Chorus: GASHI]
You can keep on frontin' but I know
You like that, why you acting like that?
You can keep on frontin' but I know
You like that, why you acting like that?

[Chorus: GASHI]
Because you creep on me when you’re alone
And you act like you can’t fall in love
Every single night you call my phone
Always asking if nobody’s home (Yeah)
Come around like the summer time
You bring bright light into my life
When I’m with you I feel alright
Come around like the summer time
You bring bright light into my life
When I’m with you I feel alright (Yeah)

[Post-Chorus: DJ Snake]
"Pay attention 'round me," you said
"Pay attention 'round me," you said

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Shorty creep on me
And I know ah, and I know ah
Shorty creep on me, I know ah
Creep in the morning, creep in the evening, Creep in the night time (Freak!)
She’s a freak in the morning, freak in the evening, Freak in the night time (Freak!)
Money can’t buy you love, but I know where to find you love
Aspen’s not the Poconos, not the guy with the open toes
Talk about Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Talk about South Greece, South Beach, Maldives, back to New York and LA

[Chorus: GASHI]
Because you creep on me when you’re alone
And you act like you can’t fall in love
Every single night you call my phone
Always asking if nobody’s home (Yeah)
Come around like the summertime
You bring bright light into my life
When I’m with you I feel alright
Come around like the summertime
You bring bright light into my life
When I’m with you I feel alright (Yeah)

[Post-Chorus: DJ Snake]
"Pay attention 'round me," you said
"Pay attention 'round me," you said
