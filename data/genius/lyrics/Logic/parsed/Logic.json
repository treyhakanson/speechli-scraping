Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight\n\n[Verse 2]\nLivin' life like this\nHope little Bobby never fight like this\nStab a motherfucker with a knife like this\nAll about the money on a night like this\nRun up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib\nGot a lot to give, but I never had the chance\nNever had the chance, yeah\nStay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out\nIf you want it I'ma lay it out\nHope my little brother make it out\nEvery night what I pray about what I pray about\nCheck it, uh yeah, got a son on the way\nBut I cling to the streets even though I wanna run away\nI imagine a better life\nWhere I never had a debt in life\nHit you with the *gunshots* in the dead of night\nSellin' crack to my own pops\nPushin' this weight on my own block\nIf I sell a brick I can buy a house\nIf they find the key they might lock me up\nBut I take the chance\n'Cause I need that shit and don\u2019t give a fuck\nTake the chance, 'cause I need that shit and don\u2019t give a fuck\n[Pause] \u2014 Get down or lay down\nHit ya with the Beretta, you better stay down\nStray shots on the playground\nLivin' how I'm livin' with the life that I'm given\nAnybody that\u2019s ridin' with me, I\u2019m ridin' with 'em\nShow me the enemy, and I'ma hit 'em\nThe second I bit 'em, I get 'em\nAnd hit 'em with the venom\nAin\u2019t no need to pretend I'ma never do it\nI knew it, already been through it\nI do it for the street, for the fam, for the life\nAnybody that's gang related\n\n"}{"title": "Nikki", "artist": "Logic", "content": "I can feel you in my

feel like I'm falling lately, it feel like my children hate me\nYou tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me\nHaunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me\nAnd lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I\u2019m me, but still\nYou always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel\nBetter, but you been answering me lesser and lesser\nSo I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone\nAnd as for... he left and he ain\u2019t coming back\nI hate him and if I see him I swear I tell him that\nNo longer cooking crack in my kitchen, cutting an' selling that\nHe broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back\nI been working hard, I been searching for God\nI can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud\nPromise you won't forget me, that you'll always be with me\nAnd even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me\nUnder pressure, I've been feeling under pressure\n\n[Verse 4]\nHey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother\nHow are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya\nTried to call ya, where are ya?\nIn Paris? What a beautiful destination\nTo perish right by the Eiffel, come now, please don't be spiteful\nOf all my small talk, I think we're overdue a long talk\nWhen I see kids around the way I say how I'm your dad\nIt gets me thinking 'bout incredible moments we've had\nAnd on the real I'm trying so hard not to bug you\nBut do you think you could stop rapping about my drug use?\nI'm two years clean, no longer a fiend\nYeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19\nAnd I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there\nAnd when the time is right I know that you gon' take care\nOf anything I need, of your family\nCan I have some tickets to your next show?\nWould you stand with me?\nCan I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?\nI forgot to mention I got divorced from your step-mom\nMy mind going crazy, but I still look hella calm\nMaybe you could tell *beep*\nI've been feeling under pressure\n\n[Interlude]\nHey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know. So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been calling me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like \"damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick\" cause you know we all talk to Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga\n\n[Verse 5]\nYeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant\nEverything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent\nI know that you been insisting, I know that birthday I missed it\nI swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place\nThoughts often in another world, I started seeing another girl\nIt fell through, man, what a world\nBut I'm so focused on my craft, on employing my staff\nSuch a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft\nThis letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss\nBrothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce\nMeanwhile people outside of my blood asking for favors\nI don't owe you a fucking thing, you best switch your behavior\nTruly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through\nWe ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how your child?\nCome now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul\nSorry I ain't call before, but I'm calling you right now\nI heard that you was popping E, stop resorting to the vowel\nHow my mama, how she doing, does she know what I'm pursuing?\nI ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined\nBut sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doing\nThey say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth\nI should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth\nThis is everything I love, this is everything I need\nNever sacrifice this feeling even though my heart it bleed\nThis is everything I love, everything I need\nNever sacrifice this feeling even though my heart bleed\nUnder pressure, I've been feeling under pressure\n\n[Interlude]\nHey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. A friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wondering how things are going. Jenn and I aren't together anymore. Living on my own, you know. Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don\u2019t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grinding, you know. And I don't wanna hear you joining the Illuminati cause then I gotta kill ya. I love you, son, bye\n\n"}
