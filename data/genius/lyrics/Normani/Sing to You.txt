Title: Sing to You
Artist: Normani

[Verse 1:]
It takes more than a star
To light the night sky
And more than the clouds
To make the sun rise

[Pre Chorus:]
So I have a melody line
Can I sing it one time for you? (time for you)
And this little song of mine
Can I sing it one time for you?
And it goes like
Ooooooooooh
All I want is you

[Chorus:]
Let me sing to you
Lift you up when you were done
Let me sing to you
When there's no one left around
Let my voice just take control
I can feel it in my soul
When I sing to you
Just let me sing to you
All you gotta do is listen

[Verse 2:]
When the days seem longer
And your dreams seem far away
A little note makes it all okay

[Pre Chorus:]
So yes I have a melody line
Can I sing it one time for you? (time for you)
And this little song of mine
Can I sing it one time for you?
And it goes like
Ooooooooooh
All I want is you

[Chorus:]
Let me sing to you
Lift you up when you were done
Let me sing to you
When there's no one left around
Let my voice just take control
I can feel it in my soul
When I sing to you
Just let me sing to you

[Bridge:]
I lend a symphony, or [??]
I'll conduct the melody
I'll be your guide, open your eyes and let me in
I'll sing to you, just listen

[Chorus:]
Let me sing to you
Lift you up when you were done
Let me sing to you
When there's no one left around
Let my voice just take control
I can feel it in my soul
When I sing to you
Just let me sing to you
All you gotta do is listen
