Title: So Into You
Artist: Normani

[Verse 1]
With every passing moment
Thoughts of you run through my head
Every time that I'm near you
I realize that you're heaven sent, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I think you're truly something special
Just what my dreams are really made of
Let's stay together, you and me, boy
There's no one like you around, oh baby

[Chorus]
I really like
What you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like
What you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you

[Verse 2]
Could be that way you hold me
Could be the things that you say
Oh, I'm not sure what it is boy
But I know I like feeling this way

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I think you're truly something special
Just what my dreams are really made of
Let's stay together, you and me, boy
There's no one like around, oh baby

[Chorus]
I really like
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I'm so into you
Oh, I can't explain it
Oh
You know, you know, you know, you know
I'm so into you
Oh oh
I can't explain it
Oh, the way you hold me
Touch me, kiss me, squeeze me
And I'm so...
