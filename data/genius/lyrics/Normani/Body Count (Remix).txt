Title: Body Count (Remix)
Artist: Jessie Reyez

[Intro: Jessie Reyez]
Yeah, you don't gotta tell me 'bout your body count
I don't gotta know your ex's name
'Cause if it just so happens that you turn around and ask me
I think you might feel some type of way
I dodge dick on the daily

[Verse 1: Normani]
Funny how you think I need you
But honestly, I don’t need anything
Like what you see, you can look
But I won’t let you touch up on anything
I’m independent, I’m self sufficient
And I don’t need a wedding ring
You think you made me?
You funny, you know that? You funny, boy
You were birthed by a woman, show some fucking respect
I like you much better when you shut up
And get down, down on your knees, babe
I’m a 10 out of 10, got you saying amen
Catch me dodging that dick again and again and again

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez & Normani]
We don’t need no one (We don’t need ‘em, baby)
Tryna take our freedom (Freedom)
Time won't let you stay young
So, we don't care what they say
We gon' love who we wanna love

[Post-Chorus: Jessie Reyez, Jessie & Normani]
Oh whoa, yeah, oh, oh whoa
We gon' love who we wanna love
Oh whoa, yeah, oh
We don't care what they say
We gon' love who we wanna love

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Don’t you make me count 'em on my fingers
Gon’ be hot when I say I ran out of hands
I’m sure if tables turned and it was dollar signs per body
You would be one very rich and wealthy man
I dodge dick for some pussy, something that we can agree on
Don’t tell me it’s a turn on for you, or maybe it bothers you
That you’re the only one out the equation

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez & Kehlani]
We don’t need no one (No one)
Tryna take our freedom (No no, no no, no no)
Time won't let you stay young
So, we don't care what they say
We gon' love who we wanna love

[Post-Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
Oh whoa, yeah, oh, oh whoa
We gon' love who we wanna love
Oh whoa, yeah, oh
We don't care what they say
We gon' love who we wanna love

[Outro: Jessie Reyez, Jessie & Kehlani & Normani]
I saw my ex and then I swerved, sue me
Miss me with that bullshit for the birds, sue me
I know they did me dirty while I still had the title
But I don't hold any anger, I just swerve
Hallelujah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hallelujah
Yeah, yeah
That's what I said to them, yeah
