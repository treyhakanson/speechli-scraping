Title: SWING
Artist: Quavo

[Verse 1: Quavo]
We get allowed to swing
Oh that's a hot spot (Hot spot)
Hit her on the elevator, why not (Why not)
Make the whole block hot (Block hot)
Make the whole block hot (Block hot)
(Skrrt, skrrt) In the hot box (Skrrt, skrrt)
Right next to the chopper (Skrrt, skrrt)
And the thing go ratta (Buck, buck)
And the thing go ratta (Buck, buck)
Came from the jungle, we hot but we humble
You want to reach out tell her, just put down your number (brrrr)
If she's not a bad gyal, then I do not want her (Bo)
I like to try new things, but not with one woman (No)
Got to be three or four of 'em (Three)
Yeah, we drippin' designer, but grind on the floor (Floor)
And I do not care what I drink, just keep pourin' (Pour)
Already know what she think, girl just go in (Go, go, go)
She 'bout to go to the dance hall (Hall)
Two bad bitches got a dance-off (Off)
By the end of the night, I tried 'em all (All)

[Chorus: Quavo]
We get allowed to swing
(Swingin' ay, swingin' ay)
We get allowed to swing
(Swingin' ay, swingin' ay)
We get allowed to swing
(Swingin' ay, swingin' ay)
We get allowed to swing
(Swingin' ay, swingin' ay)
We get allowed to swing

[Post-Chorus: Quavo]
She wanna try the new tings
(She wants to try 'em)
She like to try the new tings
(She like to try 'em)

[Verse 2: Normani & Quavo]
Oh, I got you seeing double, careful not to start no trouble
Oh, I try to keep it subtle, I don't mean to burst your bubble
Oh, I've been workin' hard, I rehearsed that
Quavo loose, that's 'cause my body heard that
And I think I deserve, a lil' different tonight
Slow it down and have a drink for a second (Ay)
Come on get on my page for a second, yeah
We're the ones have a thrill, make it messy, yeah (Ay)
I just wanna show you something a lil' different, yeah
Slow it down and have a drink for a second (Ay)
Come on get on my page for a second, yeah
We're the ones have a thrill, make it messy, yeah (Ay)
I just wanna show you something a lil' different, yeah
(We allowed to swing) I know you love to swing

[Chorus: Quavo & Normani]
We get allowed to swing
(Swingin' ay, swingin' ay)
I just wanna show you something a lil' different (Yeah)
We get allowed to swing
(Swingin' ay, swingin' ay)
We get allowed to swing
(Swingin' ay, swingin' ay)
I just wanna show you something a lil' different (Yeah)
We get allowed to swing

[Post-Chorus: Quavo]
She wanna try the new tings
(She want to try 'em)
She like to try the new tings
(She like to try 'em)

[Verse 3: Davido]
The darker the berry, the sweeter the juice (Black juice)
Whenever you're ready, I'm ready to move (Ready to move)
She said don't keep me waiting
Now she's in the mood (She's in the mood)
Whenever you're ready, I'm ready to move gyal
I'll take you to Africa (Ay)
You won't see my type of car (Scoot, scoot)
The same one that Cardi got (Vroom, vroom)
Come live like a fuckin' star (Ay)
I go turn you to foreigner, yeah
For my place, you no need Visa (No need Visa)

[Chorus: Quavo]
We get allowed to swing
(Swingin', swingin')
We get allowed to swing
(Ah, swingin', swingin')
We get allowed to swing
(Ah, swingin', swingin')
We get allowed to swing
(Ah, swingin', swingin')
We get allowed to swing

[Post-Chorus: Quavo]
She want to try the new tings
(She want to try 'em)
She like to try the new tings
(She like to try 'em, we get allowed to swing)
She want to try the new tings
(She want to try 'em)
She like to try the new tings
(She like to try 'em)

[Outro: Quavo]
We get allowed to swing
(We get allowed)
She wanna try new tings
(Come and tell me!)
We get allowed to swing
(Ay, you comin' down now)
She wanna try new things
(Let 'em go, let 'em know)
Let the beat run out, ohh, oh
Let the beat run out
Yeah, we get allowed to swing
