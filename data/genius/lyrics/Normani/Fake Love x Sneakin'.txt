Artist: Normani

[Fake Love]

[Intro]
I don't really trust a word you're saying

[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face (straight up to my face)
Straight up to my face (straight up to my face)
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face
Straight up to my face (straight up to my face)

[Verse 1]
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Seems like you hidin' your problems
Really, you never was solid
No, you can't "son" me
You won't never get to run me
Just when shit look outta reach
I reach back like one, three
Like one, three
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time, they wanna take my place
Whole time, they wanna take my place
Whole time, they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake (I can tell your love is fake)
I don't trust a word you say (I don't)
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
Look you in the face and it's just not the same

[Interlude]
I've been down so long, they look—

[Sneakin']

[Chorus]
They just keep on reachin' and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my woes for assistance
You gon' make me call my woes for assistance
And they just keep on reachin' and dissin'
Put me in a fucked-up position
Make me call my woes for assistance
You gon' make me call my woes

[Verse 2]
Baby, he a savage, he ain't romantic
When I come around these rappers, they be startin' to panic
And they pockets goin' under like the Titanic
I was good last night, bae, I was outstandin'
They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now
He was playin' wit' me then but he waitin' now
Used to sleep inside a den, I got acres now
Was playin' mall shows but hey, I'm main-stagin’ now
Damn!

[Fake Love (Reprise)]

[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face (straight, straight up)
Straight up to my face (come on baby, baby)
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face
Straight up to my face
