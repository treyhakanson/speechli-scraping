Title: Love Lies (Solo Version)
Artist: Normani

[Verse 1]
Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe
I need a lover to trust, tell me you're on my side
Are you down for the ride?
It's not easy for someone to catch my eye
But I've been waitin' for you for my whole damn life

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it
I see you're focused, yeah you're so independent
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it
You've got something to say and I'm here to listen

[Chorus]
So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies

[Verse 2]
I've been so into your mystery
Is it because of our history?
Are you into me?
When it feels so good, but it's bad for you
Can't say I don't want it 'cause I know I do
Come on over, I need your company
Cravin' that synergy

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it
I see you're focused, yeah you're so independent
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it
You've got something to say and I'm here to listen

[Chorus]
So baby
Tell me, tell me
Underneath the sunrise
Oh

[Bridge]
Are you down? Don't hide it
Feelin' me, you don't gotta deny it
Baby you gon' make me overnight it
Tell me, are you down?
Tell me, are you down?
Don't hide it
You don't gotta deny it
Tell me, tell me, are you down?

[Chorus]
Tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Tell me where your love lies
Show me where your love lies
Oh, ah
