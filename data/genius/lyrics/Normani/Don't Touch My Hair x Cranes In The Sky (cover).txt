Title: Don't Touch My Hair x Cranes In The Sky (cover)
Artist: Normani

Don't touch my hair
When it's the feelings I wear
Don't touch my soul (no, no)
When it's the rhythm I know
Don't touch my crown
They say the vision I've found
Don't touch what's there
When it's the feeling I wear

They don't understand
What it means to me
Where it chose to go
Where it been to know
They don't understand
What it means to me
Where it chose to go
Where it been to know

You know this hair is my shit
Rolled the rod, I gave it time
But this here is mine
You know this hair is my shit
Rolled the rod, I gave it time
But this here is mine

What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?

What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say, What you say
What you say (you)
What you say to me?
What you say to me?

I tried to drink it away
I tried to put one in the air
I tried to dance it away
I tried to change it with my hair

I ran my credit card bill up
Thought a new dress would make it better
I tried to work it away (away)
But that just made me even sadder (sadder)

I tried to keep myself busy
I ran around in circles
Think I made myself dizzy
I slept it away, I sexed it away
I read it away

Away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away

Well it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal cloud
Well it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal-
(la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
(away, away, away)

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
(away, away, away)

Yeah
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
