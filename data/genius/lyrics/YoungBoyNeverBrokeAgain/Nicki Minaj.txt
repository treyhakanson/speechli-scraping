[Intro]
June, you're a Genius
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Slime

[Verse 1]
Daffyeny wrote me and she said that you for me
Like I ain't already for somebody (already for somebody, yeah)
But I responded and I told her I'm good
I'm hurt inside, I can't trust nobody
(Hurt no I can't trust nobody)
I need a girl who gon' tell me that we good
Hold me down and just show me how to love (yeah)
I need a woman who gon' teach me how to do
When they come 'round she don't ever give a fuck, yeah

[Chorus]
Who will never leave me, always happy for to see me
Who will never mistreat me, entertain me like a TV
One who adore me, go to war do anything for me
Always go hard for me, never lie, now that's real loyalty

[Verse 2]
Slide on that boy for me
While I shoot she gon' drive the car for me
When I go and I'm gone too long and if I don't call
Best believe she calling me
She always gon' go hard for me
She don't like when hoes be stalking me
And she don't never trip 'bout nothing if I don't want talk
She gonna tell stop calling me
Yeah, she deep into me like some water (yeah, water)
Teach me how to never be like my father (like my father)
Aye, hold down for a challenge like a Charger (like a Charger)
She gon' fuck me better when she see I'm recording her

[Chorus]
Who will never leave me, always happy for to see me (for her to see me)
Who will never mistreat me, entertain me like a TV
One who adore me, go to war do anything for me
Always go hard for me, never lie, now that's real loyalty
I need a girl who gon' tell me that we good
Hold me down and just show me how to love, yeah
I need a woman who gon' teach me how to do
When they come round she don't ever give a fuck, yeah
She gon' ride in the car with a crack sack
When she screaming out slat with a black at
When I turn into slime she gon' stop that
When a nigga write her she don't write back
Right here with her where the life at
Statement on me, she ain't type that
Whole lot of big money, I talk that
I ain't have to buy her she a big bach

[Verse 3]
And she got big fetish for Gucci shoes
When I go to the mall I'ma buy a few
She gon' clutch on that, like a rider do
Slanging nine for the gang like a pirate do (blrtt skltt)
Step on that gas in the Audi Coupe
(blatt fow fow fow)
She up on a Glock like a gangster do

[Break]
Aye, if she was sitting right here with me
While I was recording
She be like
"Boy what the hell is you doing? You crazy as the fuck"
My man, I responded and I say look this what I need you to do
Just be the girl who

[Chorus]
Who will never leave me, always happy for to see me
Who will never mistreat me, entertain me like a TV
One who adore me, go to war do anything for me
Always go hard for me, never lie, now that's real loyalty
She gon' ride in the car with a crack sack
When she screaming out slat with a black at
When I turn into slime she gon' stop that
When a nigga write her she don't write back
Right here with her where the life at
Statement on me, she ain't type that
Whole lot of big money I talk that
I ain't have to buy her she a big bach
