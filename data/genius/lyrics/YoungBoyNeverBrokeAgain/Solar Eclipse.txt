Title: Solar Eclipse
Artist: YoungBoy Never Broke Again

[Intro]
Mmm, mmm
Yeah, mmm
Oh yeah
As I ride on the city lights
I wonder who gon' ride for me if it go down
And I start to get this feeling like
Who gon' be there for my sons the day that I'm not around?

[Chorus]
I hope you love me as much as I love you
I ain't mean to break your heart, but baby, that's what thugs do
Nothing in the world, baby I wouldn't do for you
If I die right now it's so much that I would lose

[Bridge]
I'ma tell you now I always be there for you
If it go down now, I know Baby Joe gon' shoot
If you go broke now they ain't gon' do shit for you
Can't give up now, nigga this the life I choose

[Post-Chorus]
Back in 8th grade, I swear I ain't have a thing baby
Since I got money, I swear it ain't been the same baby
Got money in my pocket, diamonds in my chain baby
I won't ever hurt again, I made through the rain baby

[Verse 1]
Before the fame, I was strapped up on Valley Park with a Glock
I was sellin' them rocks, these police stay watchin' steady passin' by the block
I created that gang, forever I bang, nigga I'll never stop
I stay in my lane, I'm never gon' change, nigga playin', he get popped
I told him record me, I go safari, diamonds wetter than some water
Hellcat not a Charger, way faster than a 'Rari (skrt)
I'm turnin' up in the party, celebratin' all the shit that I did
I told my momma I'm a gangster, I'll never change the way that I live

[Pre-Chorus]
Back in 8th grade, I ain't have a thing baby
Since I got money, I swear it ain't been the same baby
Got money in my pocket, diamonds in my chain baby
I won't ever hurt again, I made through the rain baby

[Chorus]
I hope you love me as much as I love you
I ain't mean to break your heart, but baby, that's what thugs do
Nothing in the world, baby I wouldn't do for you
If I die right now, it's so much that I would lose

[Interlude]
That I would lose
Ahh ahh ahhh (Ahh)
My voice messed up right now
Mmm
Ahh baby

[Verse 2]
Out the blue, I do some magic like I be Houdini
My diamonds wet, they Aquafina like they made in Fiji
I get that Act', I crack the seal, and pour it in some Fiji
I cop a 'vette, I drop my top, and ask you, "Did you see me?"
Gone off that molly, I'm zooted and booted
Got snake on my collar, I tell you it's Gucci
I swear that I'm bout it, you play I'ma shoot it
I'm a 38 baby I swear that I'm ruthless
Walkin' on stage, I'm strapped with a toolie
Long clips, nigga I shoot a movie
I know you notice how we come through and do it
Eviction notice, nigga, bet that you movin'
Red dot and head shots for who wanna do me
Homicides, mommas cry, it ain't nothing to it
I tote them choppas, when we slide, you know I'ma shoot it
So many times I could've died, but you niggas blew it (slatt)

[Pre-Chorus]
Back in 8th grade, I swear I ain't have a thing baby
Since I got money, I swear it ain't been the same baby
Got money in my pocket, diamonds in my chain baby
I won't ever hurt again, I made through the rain baby

[Chorus]
I hope you love me as much as I love you
I ain't mean to break your heart, but baby, that's what thugs do
Nothing in the world, baby I wouldn't do for you
If I die right now, it's so much that I would lose

[Outro]
I would lose
Yeah
Youngboy
Slatt, slatt
Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
