CashmoneyAP
And I still ain't found a way to forgive myself
I can never forgive myself

[Chorus]
I gave my all to you this is how you repay me (yeahh)
I put my trust in you this is how you replace it (ohh)
Your love is poison so no more I can't take it (no more I can't take it)
Can't fuck with you no more because I ain't basic (noo)

[Verse 1]
Being loyal bring you pain (being loyal bring you pain)
Showing love will get you hanged  (showing love will get you hanged)
I won't let 'em end my name
When you do dirt you get the same
I already know that I'm a thug really big B living
Get on your ass when you be leaving you say that I'm trippin'
I gave my all to you but you don't care cause you don't get it
I gave my heart to you, you took my shit and ran with it
Momma told me that she love to see when we together
I looked and smiled I ain't tell her you the fuckin' devil
Don't need no gun cause when I'm with you, you my heavy metal
I hope you never leave my side, separate not ever
Hope you forgive me for the pain that I brought you
What's in our blood, only us know about it
Don't wanna break up cause I can't go without you
Your love I ain't never thought about doubtin'
You my thug, I can't lie you my lil baby
I'm in jail I won't be released girl you affidavit
I don't listen to my niggas, they advice I'm never takin'
If you jump up in that water I dive in for to save you
(I ain't no question)

[Chorus]
I gave my heart to you this how you repay me (yeahh)
I put my trust in you this how you replace it (ohh)
Your love is poison so no more I can't take it (no more I can't take it)
Can't fuck with you no more because I ain't basic (noo)

[Verse 2]
Everytime I feel nobody love me I come straight to you
Still wanna come and lay right on side you when I'm mad at you
I be feelin' like you don't appreciate the shit I do
Argue then you walk out, I ain't ever thought bout leaving you
Everything you do I never want another bitch to do
My past to the killin' everything I done told to you
Damn, still wish we had a baby, why the fuck we can't just be like Kay and Tracey (they been together 10yrs)

[Chorus]
I gave my heart to you this how you repay me (yeahh)
I put my trust in you this how you replace it (yeah)
Your love is poison so no more I can't take it (no more I can't take it)
I fuck with you because together we basic (together we basic)

[Outro]
Straight like that, Ion't give a fuck who don't like it
Keep it just like that
Put it on my Youtube channel
