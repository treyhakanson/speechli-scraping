Title: Genie
Artist: YoungBoy Never Broke Again

[Intro]
This a pain song but I'm letting everything go
I promise when I speak specifically about anything
Cuz that's my way of showing I don't care no more
Ima just go with my life
Until death call my name
Aye, aye Youngboy, slime yeahPlayboy on this bitch but he ain't playing though

[Chorus]
Too many problems (yeah)
Thinking how I'm gone solve it (yeah)
So much pain in my body (yeah)
They selling lies and I bought it (yeah)
Don't tell me that you love me, if you ain't going to die for me
You can stay the fuck from round me
If you ain't gonna ride for me
Told  me you would never leave
How could you just lie to me (yeah)
Get from off your knees you ain't got to cry to me (yeah)
I been giving all my love, tell me do you feel it
Never learned how to trust sittin' in penitentiary
All for you I'll take a slug baby
Who the realest had to tell her I'm a genie
I can answer wishes (yeah)

[Verse 1]
I got my static when you ride with me
We get pulled over no you ain't going to do no time for me
I put my hands up police drew down on me
So many charges make me wanna go away over seas
Reminiscing 'bout them days I was sittin' up in that cage
I was begging you to stay and you hung up in my face
Free Kodak, everything gettin' slayed
They keep begging me to change
Talked to Future the other day and he say I need to change lanes (yeah)
Cause they gon' try to count you out til you make them count you in (yeah)
Stimulate my brain (yeah, yeah) had to tell 'em I ain't leaving out the same way I came in (yeah) (oh, fuck what i saying)
Whole lot a heroin, I sell that shit right in front of my momma
Swear I would never run just like a man ima face my problems
Even when my voice fucked up
Ima spit in the booth Ima go in like a goblin
Nigga got me fucked up
Ima spin on his block, I admit that I had shot him
VVSs in my chain tell that hoe Young Thug everything
Hearing voices in brain hoping everything change
I been rolling through the streets and been clutching on my heat
I put blood all on my feet and I put cameras in my trees (baby)
Said I changed on you, but I feel that you changed on me
I said my prayers and you gon' sow just what you reap (yeah)
I been taking Adderall mixing it with lean (mixin' it wit lean)
Hope I don't wake up out my sleep

[Chorus]
Too many problems (too many problems) (yeah)
Thinking how I'm gone solve it (yeah) (solve it, solve 'em)
So much pain in my body (yeah)
They selling lies and I bought it (yeah) (sell those lies and I bought it)
Don't tell me that you love me, if you ain't going to die for me (oh)
You can stay to fuck from round me
If you ain't gonna ride for me (eh)
Told me you would never leave
How could you just lie to me (yeah)
Get from off your knees you ain't got to cry to me (yeah)
I been giving all my love, tell me do you feel it
Never learned how to trust sittin' in penitentiary
All for you I'll take a slug baby
Who the realest had to tell her I'm a genie
I can answer wishes (yeah) (I can answer wishes man)

[Verse 2]
Being in love never help me solve my problems (my problems)
I wish that I could find a girl just like my momma
I don't wanna hurt nobody, but still ride around with that chopper (yeah)
Zoe life to the end, tell them free the main sniper (tell 'em free kodak)

[Outro]
Yeah (I call that)
Slatt Slatt Slatt
That's all life
Sla-sla-slatt
Slatt Slatt Slatt
Yeah that slatt
