Title: Untouchable
Artist: YoungBoy Never Broke Again

[Verse 1]
I remember I wanted for to quit for so many times
But I know this moment'd come, now it's my time
I gotta make up for all them nights that my Momma cried
I'm goin' in, I'm putting everything on the line
Dropped out of school to chase my dream, I had some for to prove
I put my all in this shit, man I can't fuckin' lose
They smile up in my face but they don't know what I been through
Whole lotta nights I went to sleep and I ain't had no food
But now I'm up and I'm just thinking about my next move
Gotta keep my head above water, gotta make it through
I do this shit for my momma and my lil' brother too
Ain't no more problems now I might as well go back to school
Gotta maintain, stay on my grind no I can't be no fool
Naw I can't slip nor I can't fumble, gotta stick and move
Get out BR, move to LA, where I ain't gotta keep a tool
Surprise but I knew my dreams coming true

[Chorus]
We had nothing, stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong forever right, you know wassup with me nigga
Never change on my gang yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas
We untouchable come run that money up with me nigga
We had nothing, stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong forever right, you know wassup with me nigga
Never change on my gang yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas
We untouchable come run that money up with me nigga

[Verse 2]
Now that I made it, ain't none the same it all changed
When I'm in public people see me they screaming my name
Just a few days ago I was locked up in them chains
Now I'm in back of the Maybach with a lot of bands
I ain't worry 'bout 'em dissin' naw, I don't hear a thing they sayin'
This for sons in Montana and can't forget Lil Ben
I never jeopardize this and lose it all again
This for that North, 38 baby, they know I ain't playing
From the heart I appreciate all of my fans
This for Monique for loving me and bein' my helping hand
I really did it, this for for mom's, 3Three, Trey and Aaron
Can't nobody tell me nothing I'm like what you sayin'

[Chorus]
We had nothing, stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong forever right, you know wassup with me nigga
Never change on my gang yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas
We untouchable come run that money up with me nigga
We had nothing, stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong forever right, you know wassup with me nigga
Never change on my gang yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas
We untouchable come run that money up with me nigga
