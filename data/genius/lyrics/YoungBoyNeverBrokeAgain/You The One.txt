Title: You The One
Artist: YoungBoy Never Broke Again

[Intro]
I think clear
Dubba-AA flexin'
Louie Bandz made another one
This is the sound

[Chorus]
You the one that I want in my life, yeah
You the one that I want every night, yeah
You the one that I want on my side, yeah
Promise for you I'll ride
I need you to be there for me, yeah
I'm so deep up in these streets, yeah
I stay clutching on my heat, yeah
I know these niggas wan' kill me

[Verse 1]
Studio bus when I'm touring
Floatin', don't know where I'm goin'
I don't even know what I'm doin'
But I know I'm getting to it
Heard they moving in and they armed
When they come just set off the alarm
On my soul I ain't goin'
AK strapped to my arm
Told my girl that I need you baby
Thinking 'bout you lately, I been goin' crazy
When you leave out of school
Come and pull up on me, I just want to taste it
You know your boyfriend crazy
Goin' hard, turning up on the daily
You touch me down to my heart
When you told me you was happy that I made it
I been caught up sack chasing
Gotta take care of my babies
Random people steady hating
I don't ever let it faze me
Heart steady keep on racin'
Abusing drugs that I'm takin'
I'm okay when I'm under you baby
I just wanna lay under you baby

[Chorus]
You the one that I want in my life, yeah
You the one that I want every night, yeah
You the one that I want on my side, yeah
Promise for you I'll ride
I need you to be there for me, yeah
I'm so deep up in these streets, yeah
I stay clutching on my heat, yeah
I know these niggas wan' kill me

[Verse 2]
Say they love me, they don't love me
Ain't nobody that I'm trustin'
Ain't got no time to be fussin'
I need you to be there for me
So many hoes wanna fuck me
Baby that ain't worth nothin'
Know I want us to be together
I won't change on you for nothing, yeah
I won't change on you for nothing
You won't never want for nothing
I won't change on you for nothing
You won't never want for nothing
You won't never want for nothing

[Chorus]
You the one that I want in my life, yeah
You the one that I want every night, yeah
You the one that I want on my side, yeah
Promise for you I'll ride
I need you to be there for me, yeah
I'm so deep up in these streets, yeah
I stay clutching on my heat, yeah
I know these niggas wan' kill me
