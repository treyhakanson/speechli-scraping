Title: Through The Storm
Artist: YoungBoy Never Broke Again

[Intro: TÃ©a Leoni & Martin Lawrence]
I need to talk to Mike Lowrey
Hello?
This is Mike Lowrey

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the night when it be stormin'
Hopin' everything could clear up by the morning
Niggas tellin' lies so I gotta be honest
Ask me for to tell it, you know that I'ma run it

[Chorus]
Turned up like who want it, we pulled up on that dumb shit
Flexin' on these niggas, pockets full of blue hundreds
Ain't no goin' back, you know I'm gon' keep it comin'
Ain't no time to waste, a nigga play, we gon' burn him, yeah

[Verse 1]
Today Friday so you know we on that Clyde and Dodo
I got black and white bitches knockin' at my door though
I'm in the middle of the room posted with a .44
I got it out in case a nigga wanna take a photo
Remember me and Three we used to ride up in a stolo
Now I'm in a two-door coupe, it used to be a four-door
Don't pay for cable, he want static, tell him let me know though
I'm quick to let a nigga have it, you know I'ma blow though
Late at night I used to sneak out my grandfather window
And I was coolin' on a flight, and I was hittin' them licks though
Wasn't for him I wouldn't be shit, so I ain't gotta trip though
Ten thousand dollars, that ain't shit, I gave him that times three though (slime)

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the night when it be stormin'
Hopin' everything could clear up by the morning
Niggas tellin' lies so I gotta be honest
Ask me for to tell it, you know that I'ma run it

[Chorus]
Turned up like who want it, we pulled up on that dumb shit
Flexin' on these niggas, pockets full of blue hundreds
Ain't no goin' back, you know I'm gon' keep it comin'
Ain't no time to waste, a nigga play, we gon' burn him, yeah

[Verse 2]
Can't tote no gun but got that Glock when I'm up in the yo' though
Plus my PO and the police knockin' at my door though
I get Q-Red to lace the track just like a blunt of dope though
I told Nene I'm comin' back, she think I'm with a hoe though
Hundred grand in my pocket when I wanna flex
Back in the day them niggas laughed when I said I'm next
Up with the choppa 'case that boy try reach for my neck
You know I'll pop 'em, fuck that shit, I put his ass to rest (brrt, slime)

[Chorus]
Turned up like who want it, we pulled up on that dumb shit
Flexin' on these niggas, pockets full of blue hundreds
Ain't no goin' back, you know I'm gon' keep it comin'
Ain't no time to waste, a nigga play, we gon' burn him, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
I told that boy I'm slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
I told that boy he not gon' take my sack, yeah
And if he play, I swear I'm goin' hard back
