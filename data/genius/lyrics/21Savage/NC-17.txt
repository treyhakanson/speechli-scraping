Artist: Travis Scott

[Intro: Travis Scott]
Ooh

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me and my bitch, I swear we like the same sex (Ooh)
Fuck with all my chains on, let's have chain sex (Serve, yeah)
Hangin' with the gang, you get your fangs wet (Wet)
Wanna kick with the gang, you gotta bang it (It's lit)
If you gon' throw ice on, gotta swang it (Ice)
Holes in the wall, I can not hang it (Nah)
Pour different colors, sippin', tainted (Ooh)
Woah, think the vibe just start vibratin' (Vibe)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Don't do playgrounds, we do not swing sets (Swing)
Shawty got the K, don't entertain threats (Cah-cah)
Shawty came my way she brought the same sex (Same)
Bust it down, she talkin' body language (It's lit)
Eating that punane, got my bangs wet (Eat it up)
We gon' have to change for the banquet (Drippin')
Solo with Mulsanne, it's not the same specs (Skrrt, skrrt)
Pull up, left with something I ain't came with (All right)

[Interlude: Travis Scott]
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Ice, froze, glow
Get, glow, get, glow (Yah, yah)

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Three main bitches thinkin' they my main bitch (21, 21)
Hit the club and swap the hoes I came with (Straight up, straight up)
Don't you come outside, we on that gang shit (Straight up, straight up)
Had to switch my t-shirt 'cause she stained it (On God)
Had to buy a visa, she from Moscow (21)
Fuckin' 'round with Travis, you get crossed out (Crossed out)
He used to be on, that nigga off now (He off now)
I done got so rich, I Saint Laurent my dogs now (Straight up, straight up)
Earrings cost a quarter certified by GIA (21)
If it's 'bout my bae or 'bout some smoke I'm on my way (Skrrt, skrrt)
Your bitch gave the Kid Cudi but I'm not signed to Ye (On God)
I nutted on her cheek, her new nickname is "Babyface" (21)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me and my bitch, I swear we like the same sex (Ooh)
Fuck with all my chains on, let's have chain sex (Serve, yeah)
Hangin' with the gang, you get your fangs wet (Wet)
Wanna kick with the gang, you gotta bang it (It's lit)
If you gon' throw ice on, gotta swang it (Ice)
Holes in the wall, I can not hang it (Nah)
Pour different colors, sippin', tainted (Ooh)
Woah, think the vibe just start vibratin' (Vibe)
