Title: XXL Freshmen 2016 Cypher - Part 2
Artist: XXL

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Rest in power, it's all about power
Squeeze two lemons together and really all you'll have is sour
Diesel, niggas'll smoke your ass to have the juice
Riding around in an all black coupe
Couple of pigeons that's ready to shoot, shit
Ducking and bucking and dodging and dropping
With 48 ounces and cigarette butts
Fucking around with the up echelon
They will turn you to cubes and I hope you be gone
Envelope, overload, cranium overdose
Denny Cascade, what the fuck is the halves
Click clack, get powed, bitch it's a wrap
Tierra my witness, I pray for a nap
Youngin' and restless, return with a past
Key in ignition, foot on the gas
None of you niggas is acting that jab
Gold teeth in the Glock and a Cybertech mask
Ring gun, particles, turn you into molecules
Planet shrooms, planet shrooms, I'll take you to my panic room

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert & Kodak Black]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All these niggas stealin’ my style, can I get my flow back?
Yeah, bop on that bitch like Kodak
Yeah, bitch you know dat
Yeah, I push your shit all back (woop woop)
Told that bitch I got money, ayy (woop)
Countin’ them hundreds, it’s nothing, ayy
Told that lil bitch I got money, ayy
Told that lil bitch that’s it nothing, ayy (skrt, skrt, tied)
Hit that bitch right from the back, she got turkey, I knock out that bitch like it’s stuffing, ew (skrt, skrt, tied, ok!)
Told that lil bitch that I’m with it
Told that lil bitch that I’m with it
Ay, wait, 21, Lil Boat, yeah (win)
Denzel Curry cut your throat, yeah (yeah)
Kodak do the most, yeah (win)
Told that lil bitch I got all the money (uhh)
I swear this shit is just nothing (uhh)
I just be dancin’ right up on that bitch, yeah
What you be stuntin’?

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
That boy not gang, no that boy not my friend
I hang with my gang the same gang that felt all of my pain
When I was struggling through the rain
When I had no guap with no ice
Wasn’t no food but rice
All of these bitches they want me but they get 1Night
Fuck ‘em, I give a fuck what you sayin’
Bitch nigga know I ain’t playing
I’m ‘bout my fetty
Sailing Team armored, we ready
Fuck up that nigga if he talk out too heavy
I’m bout it, chains on my neck cost me twenty
Look at your diamonds
Your diamonds look cloudy, they fake
Young nigga in the Gucci Stans
Fuck with me if you wanna die
Young nigga I don’t wear no suit and ties
Fuck no
Lil Boat!

[Verse 4: 21 Savage, Lil Uzi Vert, & Lil Yachty]
21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21
I sent my bitch to the store ‘cause we ran out of soda (what?)
Bitch I'm tryna cook this yola (21)
Hundred round drum on the bottom of that shit (do-do-do-do)
Chop a nigga down like a fucking lawnmower (grrrrrr)
AK47 ‘round my motherfucking shoulder (21)
Pull up in a Rover then I pulled off on a Fisker
Pulled up on your bitch, she sucked my dick
And then you kissed her (goddamn, 21)
Young savage bitch
And I don’t play ‘round with them swishers (hmm?)
I just smoke them woods (yeah)
Bitch I’m from the hood (yeah)
Zone 6, Bouldercrest Road, you can’t go there
21 Gang bitch, yeah (21, 21, 21)
I’m in NYC, I think I got a fucking show there (yeah)
Hold up, Rollie on my wrist
Rollie on my bitch (what?), 30 on my waist (what?)
30 to your face (yeah), 60 to your face (yeah)
90 to your face (yeah), that’s a closed case (yeah)
You an old nigga, man you washed up
Young Savage, man I got my car washed up
Pulled up on a motherfucking nigga, wrapped up (yeah)
Then I pulled up in a motherfucking Brink’s truck
21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21

[Verse 5: Kodak Black]
Who the fuck picked this lil sorry ass beat?
I’m from the ugly corner man, them lil sour ass streets
Damn homie, I’m the one who let your starving ass eat
And you was hungry, I ain’t have to let your sorry ass eat
My cousin G-Wayne got off of manslaughter last week
Gave my dog a buck fifty, that nigga brought me back three
I’ma — a nigga's broad and get up all in them cheeks
Tied, they dead flies
