Title: Love on the Brain
Artist: Rihanna

[Verse 1]
And you got me like, "Oh, what you want from me?"
(What you want from me?)
And I tried to buy your pretty heart, but the price too high
Baby you got me like "Oh"
You love when I fall apart (fall apart)
So you can put me together and throw me against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you got me like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii, woo i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
Just start loving me (loving me)
Owwwwww

[Chorus]
And babe I’m fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe
And I run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That’s got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the brain yeah
And it keeps cursing my name
No matter what I do
I’m no good without you
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the..... brain

[Verse 2]
Baby keep loving me
Just love me
Yeah, just love me
All you need to do is love me, yeah
Got me like, ah-ha-ha-owww
I’m tired of being played like a violin
What do I gotta do to get in your motherfuckin’ heart?
Baby like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii, woo i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you got me like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii, woo i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
Just start loving me (loving me)
Ooooooohhh

[Chorus]
And babe I’m fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe
And I run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That’s got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the brain yeah
And it keeps cursing my name
No matter what I do
I’m no good without you
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the.... brain
