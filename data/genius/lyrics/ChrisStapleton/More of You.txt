Title: More of You
Artist: Chris Stapleton

[Verse 1: Chris Stapleton]
When I think of you and the first time we met
And I heard the sound of your sweet gentle voice
My heart took me over and gave me no choice
And right then I knew

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Morgane Stapleton]
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

[Verse 2: Chris Stapleton with Morgane Stapleton]
When I look at you now that years have gone by
I think of the memories that time can't erase
And all of the smiles that you've brought to my face
Your love's been so true

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Morgane Stapleton]
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

[Verse 3: Chris Stapleton & Morgane Stapleton]
When I leave this earth you'll be holding my hand
And it gives me comfort to know you'll be there
And I'll thank the Lord for the love that we share
You're heaven to me

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Morgane Stapleton]
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

[Outro: Chris Stapleton with Morgane Stapleton]
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you
