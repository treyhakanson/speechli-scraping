Title: Whiskey and You
Artist: Chris Stapleton

[Verse 1]
There's a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And it's empty so right now I don't feel a thing
And I'll be hurtin' when I wake up on the floor
But I'll be over it by noon
That's the difference between whiskey and you

[Verse 2]
Come tomorrow, I can walk in any store
It ain't a problem, they'll always sell me more
But your forgiveness
Well, that's somethin' I can't buy
There ain't a thing that I can do
That's the difference between whiskey and you

[Chorus]
One's a devil, one keeps drivin' me insane
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
But one's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you

[Verse 3]
I've got a problem but it ain't like what you think
I drink because I'm lonesome and I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
But if I don't break down and bring it on myself
It'll hit out of the blue
That's the difference between whiskey and you

[Chorus]
One's a devil, one keeps drivin' me insane
At times I wonder, oh, if they ain't both the same
One's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you

[Outro]
Aww, that's the difference between whiskey and you
