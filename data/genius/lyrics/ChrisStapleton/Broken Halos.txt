Title: Broken Halos
Artist: Chris Stapleton

[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

[Verse 1]
Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

[Verse 2]
Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
