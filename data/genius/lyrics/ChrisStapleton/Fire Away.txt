Title: Fire Away
Artist: Chris Stapleton

[Verse 1]
Honey, load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend I'm a shelter
For heartaches that don't have a home

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that I'll say, is...

[Chorus]
Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

[Verse 2]
Well, I wish I could say
That I've never been here before
But you know and I know
That I'll always come back for more

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Your love might be my damnation
But I'll cry to my grave

[Chorus]
Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

[Outro]
Aww, fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away
Fire away
Aww, fire away
Fire away
