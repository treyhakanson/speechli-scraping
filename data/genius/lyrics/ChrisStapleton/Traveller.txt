Title: Traveller
Artist: Chris Stapleton

[Verse 1]
I see the sunrise creepin' in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then sheâ€™s gone again, and

[Chorus]
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

[Verse 2]
My heartbeat's rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turnin' on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound

[Chorus]
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

[Bridge]
When I'm gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along

[Chorus]
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
