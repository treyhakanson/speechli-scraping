Title: Either Way
Artist: Chris Stapleton

[Verse 1]
We pass in the hall
On our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk
Is when the monthly bills are due

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life
I'm past the point of give a damn
And all my tears are cried

[Chorus]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

[Verse 2]
It's been so long since I've felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate and you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
And it's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long

[Chorus]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
I won't love you either way

[Outro]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way
