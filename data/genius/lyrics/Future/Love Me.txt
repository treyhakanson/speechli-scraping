Title: Love Me
Artist: Lil Wayne

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'ma ball 'til the day I fall

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
I can give a fuck 'bout no niggas
Long as these bitches love me

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pussy-ass nigga, stop hatin'
Lil Tunechi got that fire
And these hoes love me like Satan, man
Fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick; she's on a strict diet
That's my baby, with no makeup she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better then Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said: "â€˜Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody."
Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't!
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said: "I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud."
I said: "Baby, just make me cum, then don't make a sound."

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'ma ball 'til the day I fall

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
I can give a fuck 'bout no niggas
Long as these bitches love me

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Real nigga, fuck these haters!
These hoes got pussies like craters
Can't treat these hoes like ladies, maaaan
Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She said my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name taste like sardines to these niggas
She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed, 69, 96
I feel her heartbeat, I chest-to-chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down; I'm arrestin' this bitch
All my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches
But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes' names
But then I would be snitchin'
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges; Lil Tunechi!

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'ma ball 'til the day I fall

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
I can give a fuck 'bout no niggas
Long as these bitches love me

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
I lost a few good bitches
Met some more bad bitches
And I be schooling them niggas
Pose for your class picture
Now kiss my ass if you hating
I'm getting ass, or I'm skating
I lost a few good bitches
Met some more bad bitches
And I be schooling them niggas
Pose for your class picture
Now kiss my ass if you hating
I'm getting ass, or I'm skating, bitch!

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'ma ball 'til the day I fall

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
I can give a fuck 'bout no niggas
Long as these bitches love me
