Title: Broken Home
Artist: 5 Seconds of Summer

[Verse 1: Luke]
They would yell, they would scream, they were fighting it out
She would hope, she would pray, she was waiting it out
Holding onto a dream
While she watches these walls fall down
Sharp words like knives, they were cutting her down
Shattered glass like the past, it’s a memory now
Holding onto a dream
While she watches these walls fall down

[Chorus: Calum]
Hey, mom, hey, dad
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who’s right? Who’s wrong?
Who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain’s still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home, this broken home

[Verse 2: Calum]
Wrote it down on the walls, she was screaming it out
Made it clear she’s still here, are you listening now?
Just a ghost in the halls
Feeling empty, they’re vacant now
All the battles, all the wars, all the times that you’ve fought
She’s a scar, she’s the bruises, she’s the pain that you brought
There was life, there was love
Like a light and it’s fading out

[Chorus: Luke]
Hey, mom, hey, dad
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who’s right? Who’s wrong?
Who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain’s still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home, this broken home

[Bridge: Michael]
You've gotta let it go
You’re losing all your hope
Nothing left to hold
Locked out in the cold
Your pain and memories
They washed out all the scenes
I'm stuck in between
A nightmare and lost dreams

[Chorus: Michael & All & Calum]
Hey, mom, hey, dad
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Hey, mom, hey, dad
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who’s right? Who’s wrong?
Who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain’s still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
This broken home
