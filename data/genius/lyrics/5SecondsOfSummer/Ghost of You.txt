Title: Ghost of You
Artist: 5 Seconds of Summer

[Verse 1: Luke]
Here I am waking up, still can't sleep on your side
There's your coffee cup, the lipstick stain fades with time
If I can dream long enough, you'd tell me I'd be just fine
I'll be just fine

[Chorus: Luke]
So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down, with a shot of truth
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you

[Verse 2: Calum]
Cleaning up today, found that old Zeppelin shirt
You wore when you ran away, and no one could feel your hurt
We're too young, too dumb, to know things like love
But I know better now, better now

[Chorus: Luke & All]
So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down, with a shot of truth
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you

[Bridge: Calum]
Too young, too dumb
To know things like love
Too young, too dumb

[Chorus: Luke]
So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I'll chase it down, with a shot of truth
That my feet don't dance like they did with you
