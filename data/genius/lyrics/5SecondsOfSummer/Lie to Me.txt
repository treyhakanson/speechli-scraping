Title: Lie to Me
Artist: 5 Seconds of Summer

[Verse 1: Luke]
I saw you looking brand new overnight
And I caught you looking too, but you didn't look twice
You look happy, oh, mmm
You look happy, oh

[Pre Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Flashing back to New York City
Changing flights so you stay with me
Remember thinking that I got this right

[Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While I'm cleaning up your mess
I know he's taking off your dress
I know that you don’t, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me

[Verse 2: Luke]
It's 3 AM and the moonlight’s testing me (ah)
If I can make it 'til dawn, then it won’t be hard to see (ah)
I ain’t happy, oh, mmm mmmmm
I ain't too happy, ohhh, mmm

[Pre Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Flashing back to New York City
Changing flights so you stay with me
Problem was, I thought I had this right

[Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While I’m cleaning up your mess
I know he’s taking off your dress
I know that you don’t, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me
Singing, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Li-li-lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Li-li-lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
And I know that you don’t, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me
