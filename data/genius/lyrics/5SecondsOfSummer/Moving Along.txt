Title: Moving Along
Artist: 5 Seconds of Summer

[Intro: Luke]
Thinking 'bout you lots lately
Have you been eating breakfast alone like me?
Thinking 'bout you lots lately

[Verse 1: Calum]
Is it bad that I'm hoping that you're broken?
Is it bad that I'm wishing you're still broken?
That you haven't found fish in the ocean
Is it bad? So bad
Is it weird that I'm drunk and on my sofa?
Is it weird that I'm naked on my sofa?
All alone, damn, I wish I didn't know ya
Is it weird? So weird

[Pre Chorus: Luke]
I know I’m the stupid one who ended it
And now I'm the stupid one regretting it
It took me a couple drinks to admit it
I know I’m the stupid one

[Chorus: All]
Thinking about you lots lately
Have you been eating breakfast alone like me?
Thinking about you lots lately
Or are you moving along?
Been thinking about you lots lately
Have you been feeling empty beds just like me?
I've been thinking about you lots, lately
Or are you moving along?

[Verse 2: Luke]
Is it wrong if I ask you to come over?
Is it wrong if I tell you that I love ya?
Even though I'd never do it when I'm sober
Is it wrong? So wrong

[Pre Chorus: Luke]
I know I’m the stupid one who ended it
And now I'm the stupid one regretting it
It took me a couple drinks to admit it
I know I’m the stupid one

[Chorus: All]
Thinking about you lots lately
Have you been eating breakfast alone like me?
Thinking about you lots lately
Or are you moving along?
Been thinking about you lots lately
Have you been feeling empty beds just like me?
I've been thinking about you lots lately
Or are you moving along?

[Bridge: Ashton & Luke]
Scared of moving on, but you're already gone
So if you’re moving on, won't you just tell me
Scared of moving on, but you’re already gone
So if you’re moving on, won't you just tell me

[Chorus: All]
Thinking about you lots lately
Have you been eating breakfast alone like me?
Thinking about you lots lately
Or are you moving along?
Been thinking about you lots lately
Have you been feeling empty beds just like me?
I've been thinking about you lots lately
Or are you moving along?

[Outro: Michael & Luke]
Scared of moving on, but you're already gone
So if you’re moving on
Are you moving along?
