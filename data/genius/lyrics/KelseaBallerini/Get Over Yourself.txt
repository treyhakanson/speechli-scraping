Title: Get Over Yourself
Artist: Kelsea Ballerini

[Verse 1]
You saw me drive by your place last Friday
But don't make too much of it
It’s just on my way home
I didn’t see the picture that you posted in this bar
And when I pulled into the parking lot
I didn't see your car

[Pre-Chorus]
You can tell your friends it’s all on purpose
That I’m the crazy ex that wrecks your life
But there's no intentions underneath the surface
So don’t go reading anything between the lines

[Chorus]
'Cause I’m over you and everything that we used to do together
My Saturday nights are brighter, I never felt better
I didn’t miss a beat when I heard you were seeing somebody else
And I’m over you thinking that every move that I’m making
Is just a game that I’m playing because my heart is still breaking
Boy, I’m over you, I’m over you
So get over yourself, yeah
So get over yourself

[Verse 2]
You think all I do is talk about us
And that the new boy I show off is only out of spite
You’re so in your head about it
You can’t get your heart around it
But boy I’m over you
I’m over you

[Chorus]
I’m over you and everything that we used to do together
My Saturday nights are brighter, I never felt better
I didn’t miss a beat when I heard you were seeing somebody else
And I’m over you thinking that every move that I’m making
Is just a game that I’m playing because my heart is still breaking
Boy, I’m over you, I’m over you
So get over yourself

[Bridge]
Guess what else?
Took all your pictures down off of my shelf
And I don’t care enough to hate you
So I even wish you well, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
So, you can tell your friends I do it all on purpose, yeah
That I’m the crazy ex that wrecks your life

[Chorus]
But I’m over you and everything that we used to do together
My Saturday nights are brighter, I never felt better
I didn’t miss a beat when I heard you were seeing somebody else
And I’m over you thinking that every move that I’m making
Is just a game that I’m playing because my heart is still breaking
Boy, I’m over you, I’m over you
So get over yourself, yeah
So get over yourself, 'cause I’m over you
So get over yourself
