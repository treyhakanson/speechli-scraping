Title: Love Song to the Earth
Artist: Paul McCartney

[Verse 1]
This is an open letter
From you and me together
Tomorrow's in our hands now
Find the words that matter
Say them out loud
And make it better somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
Looking down from up on the moon
It's a tiny blue marble
Who would've thought the ground we stand on
Could be so fragile

[Chorus]
This is a love song to the Earth
You're no ordinary world
A diamond in the universe
Heaven's poetry to us
Keep it safe, keep it safe, keep it safe
Cause it's our world, it's our world

[Verse 2]
It's not about possessions
Money, or religion
How many years we might live
When the only real question that matters
Is still a matter of perspective

[Pre-Chorus]
Looking down from up on the moon
You're a tiny blue marble
Who would've thought the ground we stand on
Could be so fragile

[Chorus]
This is a love song to the Earth
You're no ordinary world
Diamond in the universe
Heaven's poetry to us
Keep it safe, keep it safe, keep it safe
(Keep mother Earth safe)
Cause it's our world, it's our world
It's our world, it's our world, it's our world
It's our world, it's our world, it's our world

[Rap | Sean Paul]
Bang Bang Bang
See Mama earth is in a crazy mess
It's time for us to do our best
From deep sea straight up to Everst
She under crazy stress
Unless you wanna be motherless
Clean heart, Green Heart is the way
Is stress, speedniess and too much Greediness
Six billion people all want plentiness
Some people think this is harmless
(It's our world)
But if we continue their'll only be emptiness

[Chorus]
This is a love song to the Earth
You're no ordinary world
A diamond in the universe
Heaven's poetry to us
Keep it safe, keep it safe, keep it safe
(Special paradise)
Let's keep it safe
This is a love song to the Earth
You're no ordinary world
Diamond in the universe
Heaven's poetry to us
Keep it safe, keep it safe, keep it safe

[Outro]
It's our world
It's our world
It's our world
Cause it's our world
