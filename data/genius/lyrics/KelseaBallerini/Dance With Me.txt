Title: Dance With Me
Artist: Morgan Evans

[Verse 1]
May my hands be the hands you hold onto
When you let go of everything else
May my arms be the arms that you fall into
When the night gets too heavy to hold by yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're looking for a safe place to land
I will guide you home
And if the levy of your life breaks all your plans
You’ll never be alone

[Chorus]
If you dance with me
Feel my heartbeat through your body to your feet
If you dance with me
Hold me in the dark now, until both your eyes can see
And if it's you and me against the world
If I'm your man, you’re my girl
We'll win you'll see, if you dance with me

[Verse 2]
May my shoulder be the shoulder you rest your head on
When you close your eyes to sleep
And may my lips be the lips that you wake up to
Kiss you like the morning sun
All over your smile

[Pre-Chorus]
And no matter where this winding road will lead you
I will keep you strong
Through the minors and the majors, I will sing you like a song
I hope you sing along

[Chorus]
And I hope you dance with me
Feel my heartbeat through your body to your feet
I hope you dance with me
Hold me in the dark now, until both your eyes can see
And if it's you and me against the world
If I'm your man and you're my girl
We'll win you'll see, if you dance with me
And if my heart is yours and yours is mine
Together through the test of time
We’ll win you’ll see, if you dance with me
We'll win you’ll see, if you dance with me
