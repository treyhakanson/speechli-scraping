[Verse 1]
I know everybody wants you
That ain't no secret
Hey baby, what's your status?
And tell me are you tryna keep it?
Well, they can all back off
'Cause I know what I want
And while I've got your attention
Did I mention:

[Chorus]
If you got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take (hey!)
If you got a heart that ain't afraid of love, ain't afraid to break (hey!)
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well, I'm just saying, I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby, I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I'm calling dibs
On your lips
On your kiss
On your time
Boy, I'm calling dibs
On your hand
On your heart
All mine

[Verse 2]
Make everybody jealous
When I take you off the market
And get my lipstick on your right cheek
Cause boy, I've gotta mark it
Oooh
So they can all back off (yeah)
'Cause I know what I want
And while I've got you listening
Come on and show me what I'm missing
Yeah

[Chorus]
If you got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take (hey!)
If you got a heart that ain't afraid of love, ain't afraid to break (hey!)
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well, I'm just saying, I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby, I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah
I'll calling dibs
If you got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take
Hey
If you got a heart that ain't afraid of love, ain't afraid to break
Hey
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well, I'm just saying, I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby, I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I'm calling dibs
On your lips
On your kiss
On your time
Boy, I'm calling dibs
On your hand
On your heart
All mine
Yeah, boy I'm calling dibs
On your lips
On your kiss
On your time
Boy, I'm calling dibs
On your hand
On your heart
All mine, yeah

[Outro]
I'm calling dibs on your lips, on your kiss, on your time, boy
I'm just tryna make you mine, boy
Oooh
Dibs
