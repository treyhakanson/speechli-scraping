Title: In Between
Artist: Kelsea Ballerini

[Verse 1]
In between just a fling and a ring
In between an apartment and a front porch swing
In between cheap and fancy, a guitar and a Grammy
In between reckless and responsibility

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm my mother's daughter
Sometimes I'm her friend
Sometimes I play grown up
And sometimes I play pretend
Sometimes I'm a princess dress, all  ribbons and all curls
And sometimes I just wanna scream "I'm not a little girl"
Dumb enough to think I know it all
Smart enough to know I don't
Young enough to think I'll live forever
Old enough to know I won't
In between

[Verse 2]
In between beer and a basement and a Napa Valley vacation
In between hometown and a neon city
In between underestimated and over-expectated
Who I was and who I'm gonna be

[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes I'm my mother's daughter
Sometimes I'm her friend
Sometimes I play grown up
And sometimes I play pretend
Sometimes I'm a princess dress, all ribbons and all curls
And sometimes I just wanna scream "I'm not a little girl"
Dumb enough to think I know it all
Smart enough to know I don't
Young enough to think I'll live forever
Old enough to know I won't
I know I won't

[Bridge]
I'm half head up in the clouds
Half feet down on the ground
'Cause it ain't as simple
As a number, sitting on a page
When they say "act your age"
But you're stuck there in the middle

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm my mother's daughter
Sometimes I'm her friend
Sometimes I play grown up
And sometimes I play pretend
Sometimes I'm a princess dress, all ribbons and all curls
And sometimes I just wanna scream "I'm not a little girl"
Dumb enough to think I know it all
Smart enough to know I don't
Young enough to think I'll live forever
Old enough to know I won't
In the in between, yeah
In the in between

[Outro]
Hey sweet pea, it's momma
I just wanna let-cha know that I love you
Thinking about you, missing you
While you're on the road
Can't wait to see you when you get back
