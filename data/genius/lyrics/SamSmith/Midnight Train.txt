Title: Midnight Train
Artist: Sam Smith

[Verse 1]
I choose me, and I know that’s selfish, love
You are a dream, and I can’t thank you enough
But I give another piece of me away
Every wakin' day that I’m with you
Am I a monster? What will your family think of me?
They brought me in, they helped me out with everything
But I give a little piece of me away
Every single day

[Chorus]
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin' I can’t explain
I’ll always love you
But tonight’s the night I choose to walk away
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo

[Verse 2]
Love you so much that I have to let you go
I’ll miss your touch and the secrets we both know
But it would be wrong for me to stay
And I’ll just give you hope

[Chorus]
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin' I can’t explain
I’ll always love you
But tonight’s the night I choose to walk away
I can’t stop cryin', I hate that I’ve caused you pain
But I can’t deny it, I just don’t feel the same
I’ll always love you
But tonight’s the night I choose to walk away
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin' I can’t explain
I’ll always love you
But tonight’s the night I choose to walk away
