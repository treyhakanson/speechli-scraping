[Intro: Adele Givens]
'Cause you know in the old days
They couldn't say the shit they wanted to say
They had to fake orgasms and shit
We can tell niggas today:
"Hey, I wanna cum, mothafucka!"

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)

[Verse 1: Lil Pump]
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (Love it, love it)
(I'ma fuck a bitch, tell her cousin)
Your boyfriend is a dork, McLovin (Dork)
(McLovin; ooh, ooh, ooh)
I just pulled up in a Ghost (Ghost)
Fucked that bitch up out in London (Up out in)
Then I fucked up on her cousin
Or her sister, I don't know nothin' (Uh-uh, woo)
And my niggas gettin' ignorant
Like a lighter, bitch, we ignant (Ignant, yeah)
All this water on my neck
Look like I fell when I went fishin' (Fell!)
So much diamonds on my bust down
Ooh, fuck, what's the time? (Where we at?)
Me and Smokepurpp sippin' drank (Purpp!)
Ooh, fuck, she take lines (Lines)

[Chorus: Lil Pump & Kanye West]
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it, scoop!)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)

[Interlude: Kanye West]
You're such a fuckin' ho
When the first time they ask you if you want sparklin' or still?
Why you tryna act like you was drinkin' sparklin' water 'fore you came out here?
You're such a fuckin' hâ€”

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (Whoop!)
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (Whoop!)
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (Whoop!)
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (Whoop!)
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck
I like my dick sucked, I'll buy you a sick truck
I'll buy you some new tits, I'll get you that nip-tuck
How you start a family? The condom slipped up
I'm a sick fuck, I'm inappropriate
I like hearin' stories, I like that ho shit
I wanna hear mo' shit, I like the ho shit
Send me some mo' shit, you triflin' ho bitch (Bitch, bitch, bitch)

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)

[Outro: Adele Givens]
'Cause you know in the old days
They couldn't say the shit they wanted to say
They had to fake orgasms and shit
We can tell niggas today:
"Hey, I wanna cum, mothafucka!"
