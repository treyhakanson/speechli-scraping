[Verse 1]
I don't want to hear you got a boyfriend
Sometimes you're better off alone
But if you change your mind you know where I am
Yeah, if you change your mind you know where to find me
But I don't ever want to be your boyfriend

[Pre-Chorus]
And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
Push another girl aside and just give in

[Chorus]
Girls love girls and boys
Sophisticated
Manipulated
Girls love girls and boys
Sophisticated
Manipulated
And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys
And love is not a choice

[Verse 2]
Pose, you've gotta save your reputation
They're close to finding out about your girlfriend
But if you change your mind you know where I am
Yeah, if you change your mind you know where to find me
But I don't want to save your reputation

[Pre-Chorus]
And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
Push another girl aside and just give in

[Chorus]
Girls love girls and boys
Sophisticated
Manipulated
Girls love girls and boys
Sophisticated
Manipulated
And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys
And love is not a choice

[Bridge]
I'm just a villain vying for attention from a girl
A girl who can't decide
And here's the reason why
Girls love girls and boys
Girls love girls and boys

[Chorus]
Girls love girls and boys
Sophisticated
Manipulated
Girls love girls and boys
Sophisticated
Manipulated
And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys
And love is not a choice
