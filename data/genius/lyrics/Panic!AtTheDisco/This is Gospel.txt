[Verse 1]
This is gospel, for the fallen ones
Locked away in permanent slumber
Assembling their philosophies
From pieces of broken memories

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh-oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh-oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
The gnashing teeth and criminal tongues
Conspire against the odds
But they haven't seen the best of us yet

[Chorus]
If you love me let me go (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
If you love me let me go (Oh-oh-o-oh-oh-oh)
'Cause these words are knives that often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my...

[Verse 2]
This is gospel for the vagabonds
Ne'er-do-wells and insufferable bastards
Confessing their apostasies
Led away by imperfect impostors

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my...

[Bridge]
Don't try to sleep through the end of the world
And bury me alive
'Cause I won't give up without a fight

[Chorus]
If you love me let me go (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
If you love me let me go (Oh-oh-o-oh-oh-oh)
'Cause these words are knives that often leave scars
The fear of falling apart

[Outro]
And truth be told I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
The fear of falling apart
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
The fear, the fear of falling apart
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my...)
The fear of falling apart
