[Verse 1]
Do I look lonely?
I see the shadows on my face
People have told me
I don't look the same
Maybe I lost weight
I'm playing hooky
With the best of the best, pull my heart out my chest
So that you can see it too

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm walking the long road
Watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tingles my neck
How do I live?

[Chorus]
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo
How could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense of the death of a bachelor

[Verse 2]
I'm cutting my mind off
Feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two
And I just wanna be served
And when you think of me
Am I the best you've ever had?
Share one more drink with me
Smile even though you're sad

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm walking the long road
Watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tingles my neck
How do I live?

[Chorus]
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo
How could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense of the death of a bachelor

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo
How could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense of the death of a bachelor
