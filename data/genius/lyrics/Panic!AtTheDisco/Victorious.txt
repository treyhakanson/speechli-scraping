Title: Victorious
Artist: Panic! at the Disco

[Intro]
Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends we're glorious
Tonight we are victorious
Oh-oh-oh-oh, victorious
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Double bubble disco queen headed to the guillotine
Skin as cool as Steve McQueen, let me be your killer king
It hurts until it stops, we will love until it's not
I'm a killing spree in white, eyes like broken Christmas lights

[Pre-Chorus]
My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss
I know you need it, do you feel it?
Drink the water, drink the wine

[Chorus]
Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed-up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the Fourth of July
Until we feel alright
Until we feel alright

[Verse 2]
I'm like a scarf trick, it's all up the sleeve
I taste like magic, waves that swallow quick and deep
Throw the bait, catch the shark, bleed the water red
Fifty words for murder and I'm every one of them

[Pre-Chorus]
My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss
I know you need it, do you feel it?
Drink the water, drink the wine

[Chorus]
Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed-up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the Fourth of July

[Bridge]
Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends we're glorious
Tonight we are victorious
Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends we're glorious
Tonight we are victorious

[Chorus]
Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed-up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the Fourth of July
Until we feel alright
Until we feel alright

[Outro]
Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends we're glorious
Tonight we are victorious
