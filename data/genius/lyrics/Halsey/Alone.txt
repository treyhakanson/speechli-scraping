Title: Alone
Artist: Halsey

[Intro]
If I
If I

[Verse 1]
Said he tried to phone me, but I never have time
He said that I never listen, but I don't even try
I got a new place in Cali, but I'm gone every night
So I fill it with strangers so they keep on the lights
She said she told you she knows me, but the face isn't right
She asked if I recognized her and I told her I might

[Pre-Chorus]
See, everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it
But I'm still alone in my mind, yeah

[Chorus]
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)

[Verse 2]
I stayed a night out in Paris where they don't know my name
And I got into some trouble with that drink in my veins
I got a problem with parties 'cause it's loud in my brain
And I can never say sorry 'cause I won't take the blame
I know I always go missing and you're lying awake
But if you ask why I'm distant, oh, I'm running away

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it
But I'm still alone in my mind

[Chorus]
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)

[Bridge]
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
Slip under my armor
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
Slip under my armor

[Pre-Chorus]
See, everywhere I go, I got a million different people tryna hit it
But I'm still alone in my mind

[Chorus]
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)
Yeah

[Outro]
(I know you wanna, I, I know you wanna)
You'll wish that you never did
(I know you wanna slip under my armor)
Oh (I know you wanna, I, I know you wanna)
You'll wish that you never did
