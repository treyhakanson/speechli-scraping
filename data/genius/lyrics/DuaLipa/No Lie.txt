Artist: Sean Paul

[Intro: Dua Lipa]
Feel your eyes, they all over me
Don't be shy, take control of me
Get the vibe, it's gonna be lit tonight

[Verse 1: Sean Paul]
Baby girl, yuh a carry ten ton a phatness, gimme some a' dat
Mixed wid the badness, look how she hot
Shaped like goddess, but a nah jus dat
Is a good piece 'a mentals under di cap
Hot piece of frame an mi love how yuh trod
Watching every step 'a di pepper deh whe yuh got
Stayin' in ma brain, memory cyah detach
Mainly my aim is to give you this love

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Paul]
Hypnotic, the way you move
Let me acknowledge the way you do
And I would not lie, baby you
Beam me up like Scotty
It's so hypnotic, the way you move
That's why I wanted to get to you
And I would not lie, baby you
Move so hypnotic

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Sean Paul]
No lie-i-ie
Gyal we never miss
Feel your eyes, they're all over me
Don't be shy, take control of me
Get the vibe, it's gonna be lit tonight
Gyal we never miss, gyal we never miss
No li-i-i-ie
Hypnotized, pull another one
It's alright, I know what you want
Get the vibe, it's gonna be lit tonight
Gyal we never miss, gyal we never miss

[Verse 2: Sean Paul]
I'm so lit, so lit, my girl
Suh lemme see you roll it, roll it, my girl
Now lemme see you bend and fold it
Now let mi bone it
And let mi own it, my girl
Give yuh all the styles dat I have mastered
Hoist you up, baby girl, that's my word
Give you the good lovin' that is preferred
You deserve it, so don't be scared

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Paul]
