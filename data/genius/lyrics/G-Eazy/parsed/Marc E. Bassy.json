{"title": "You & Me", "artist": "Marc E. Bassy", "content": "Girl you party all the time\nDon't let me stay on your mind\nAdderall and cheap wine\nJust to stay awake in conversation\nWe were always so damn insecure\nSo how could we ever know for sure\nAnd disregard the way I know we feel\nThat would make this city way too real\n\n[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]\nIf we bump into each other\nOn a crowded street\nIt\u2019s not us no more\nIt\u2019s just you and me\nWe\u2019re just strangers in passing casually\nIt\u2019s not us no more\nIt\u2019s just you and me\n\n[Verse 2: Marc E. Bassy]\nThe shirt on my back with the rips\nGems in my golden necklace\nYou didn't give me none of this\nThere's nothing for me to miss\nWe were too young on the day we met\nHow could we say we would not forget\nAnd in the shadows there's a place for us\nSomewhere hidden they can't find our love\nDon't let 'em know\n\n[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]\nIf we bump into each other\nOn a crowded street\nIt\u2019s not us no more\nIt\u2019s just you and me\nWe\u2019re just strangers in passing casually\nIt\u2019s not us no more\nIt\u2019s just you and me\n\n[Verse 3: G-Eazy]\nEazy, and these days it's just you and me\nThis shit is dead and gone, it's not what it used to be\nSomeone give a eulogy\nKnow I'm hard headed and I might of acted foolishly\nBut you the one to hold us down usually\nWe was in a limbo\nBut of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though\nThat was my homie I had gave y'all the intro\nSome things fall apart and some get thrown out the window\nRemember when we first met we might've been too young\nBut we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb\nI used to be the one for you now you got a new one\nSo till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n\nEazy\n\n[Hook: Marc E. Bassy]\nIf we bump into each other\nOn a crowded street\nIt\u2019s not us no more\nIt\u2019s just you and me\nWe\u2019re just strangers in passing casually\nIt\u2019s not us no more It\u2019s just you and me\n\n[Outro: Marc E. Bassy]\nIf we bump into each other\nOn a crowded street\nIt's not us no more\n\n"}
