Title: Marilyn
Artist: G-Eazy


[Hook: Dominique LeJeune]
I, I, I, I, I want to love you 
But if it's not right what can I do?
Everything will be alright 
So baby get some sleep tonight

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Uh, I wish we could just pretend to be
Like we always were before as happy as the Kennedys 
No one told Jackie about Marilyn's tendencies 
Ignorance is bliss when you're married half a century
Life is too short, trying to hold it all together
It's gone before you know it but tonight could last forever
I wrote it out on paper but forgot to mail the letter 
And you could walk away but you won't find nothing better 
It's whatever, I just hope that you remember
Then I said some shit that upset her
Arguing in public, talking loud as Big sweater
She said, "You're always gone." 
I said, "'The fuck do you expect from me?" 
Then she look at me and she said to me

[Hook: Dominique LeJeune]
I, I, I, I, I want to love you 
But if it's not right what can I do?
Everything will be alright 
So baby get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Uh, maybe in some other lifetime
Or somewhere down the road
We might meet up at the right time
Girls come with the profession when you write rhymes 
Clocked me and she told me I'm a pig like I fight crime 
Well, maybe G is just an asshole
Fuck around with bitches Alfalfa, little rascal
I swear my intentions aren't as evil as you think
But temptation's always pushing people to the brink 
Fuck, I always lose my judgment when I drink
My only wish is you would settle down and hear me out
I know I haven't been completely honest and devout
It's difficult for me, these girls try to seek me out 
I try to talk it out but this was all she speak about, she said...

[Hook: Dominique LeJeune]
I, I, I, I, I want to love you 
But if it's not right what can I do?
Everything will be alright 
So baby get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Uh, so if tonight turns out to be
The last night before you peaced then walked out on me 
Let's let it all hang out like a balcony
One last time, the best is what you about to see 
So make it worth it tonight, only so you know I never hurt you in spite
Love me like you never will again, it's our last time
Tonight forget about the pastime 

[Outro: Dominique LeJeune]
Everything will be alright
So baby get some sleep tonight
