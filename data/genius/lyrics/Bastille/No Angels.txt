Title: No Angels
Artist: Bastille

[Spoken Intro: Norman, Marion]
Well I-I run the office and eh, tend the cabins and grounds and do little, eh errands for my mother. The ones she allows I might be capable of doing
And do you go out with friends?
Well a-a boy's best friend is his mother

[Verse 1: Dan Smith]
A scrub is a guy who thinks he’s fly
And is also known as a buster
Always talkin’ about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass, so

[Refrain: Dan Smith]
No, I don’t want your number
No, I don’t want to give you mine and
No, I don’t want to meet you nowhere
No, I don’t want none of your time

[Chorus: Dan Smith]
No, I don’t want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can’t get no love from me
Hangin’ out the passenger side
Of his best friend’s ride
Trying to holler at me
I don’t want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can’t get no love from me
Hangin’ out the passenger side
Of his best friend’s ride
Trying to holler at me
Trying to holler at me at me, at me

[Verse 2: Ella Eyre]
But a scrub's checkin' me and his game is kinda weak
And I know that he can not approach me
Cause I'm looking like class and he's looking like trash
Can't get with no dead beat ass, so, no

[Refrain: Dan Smith]
No, I don’t want your number
No, I don’t want to give you mine and
No, I don’t want to meet you nowhere
No, don’t want none of your time

[Chorus: Ella Eyre]
No, I don’t want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can’t get no love from me
Hangin’ out the passenger side
Of his best friend’s ride
Trying to holler at me
I don’t want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can’t get no love from me
Hangin’ out the passenger side
Of his best friend’s ride
Trying to holler at me
Holler at me
Holler at me
Holler at me

[Bridge: Dan Smith, Norman]
If you don’t have a car and you’re walking
(Oh yes son, I’ve been talking to you)
If you live at home with your mama
We're all in our private traps
If you have a shorty but you don’t show love
Clamped in them, and none of us can ever get out
Wanna get me with no money
Oh no, I don’t want to, no

[Bridge: Ella Eyre with backing vocals, Norman, Marion]
No scrubs, no scrubs
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps
No scrubs, no scrubs
I was born in mine; I don't mind it anymore
No scrubs, no scrubs
Oh but you should, you should mind it
No scrubs, no scrubs
Oh I do, ha, but I say I don't, ha

[Chorus: Dan Smith with Ella Eyre, Ella Eyre, Dan Smith]
No, I don’t want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can’t get no love from me
Hangin’ out the passenger side
Of his best friend’s ride
Trying to holler at me
I don’t want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can’t get no love from me
Hangin’ out the passenger side
Of his best friend’s ride
Trying to holler at me
Trying to holler at me
Trying to holler at me
Trying to holler at me

[Outro: Angels]
(Being as in love with you as I am)
(Being as in love with you as I am)
(Being as in love with you as I am)
(Being as in love with you as I am)
