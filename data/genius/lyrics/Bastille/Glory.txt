Title: Glory
Artist: Bastille

[Verse 1]
Deep in a corner of the night
We were lying in the middle of the road
Counting the planes as they flew by
Inconceivable imagining them go
And drunk we set the world to rights
As we fell and hit our heads upon the curb
You make me laugh until I die
Can you think of any better way to choke?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Stories told to me and stories told to you
Did you ever feel like they were ringing true?

[Chorus]
And all their words for glory
Well they always sounded empty
When we're looking up for heaven
Looking up for heaven
Way down here upon the ground
When we're lying in the dirt
There's no looking up for heaven
Looking up for heaven

[Verse 2]
Not everything had gone to plan
But we made the best of what we had, you know?
Passing the drink from hand to hand
We admit we really know nothing at all

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Stories told to me and stories told to you
And was it feeling real? And were they ringing true?

[Chorus]
And all their words for glory
Well they always sounded empty
When we're looking up for heaven
Looking up for heaven
And way down here upon the ground
When we're lying in the dirt
There's no looking up for heaven
Looking up for heaven

[Bridge]
I'll take my chances on the curb here with you
We watched the planes leave us behind
On the curb here with you
We watched the planes leave us behind

And then you put your hand in mine
And pulled me back from things divine
Stop looking up for heaven
Waiting to be buried

[Chorus]
And all their words for glory
Well they always sounded empty
When we're looking up for heaven
Looking up for heaven
Way down here upon the ground
When we're lying in the dirt
There's no looking up for heaven
Looking up...
