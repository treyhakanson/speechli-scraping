Title: Fake It
Artist: Bastille

[Intro]
And I don't think that that's a selfish want, I really don't. I'm not saying that I have this capacity because it's hard to develop that capacity on your own, when you're being stopped at every turn

[Verse 1]
Drive around, night time, nowhere to go
Melt me down, I'm like wax to your jokes
Lost and found, knocking heads, laying low
And there's no point reliving crimes to lose this

[Pre-Chorus]
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
With you

[Chorus]
Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's try our very best to fake it

[Verse 2]
Show me joy, flower through disarray
Let's destroy, each mistake that we made
Then restore the color back to the grey
There's no pride in sharing scars to prove it

[Pre-Chorus]
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
With you

[Chorus]
Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's try our very best to fake it

[Bridge]
Help me turn a blind eye
Days and nights we lost to weakness
Help me turn a blind eye
Days and nights we lost to weakness

[Chorus]
Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's do our very best to fake it
Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's do our very best to fake it
