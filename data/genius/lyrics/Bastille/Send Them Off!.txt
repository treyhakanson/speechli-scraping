Title: Send Them Off!
Artist: Bastille

[Intro: spoken]
"'It was a slight on my honor, so he deserved it
'But we're talking about the most brilliant mind this world's ever seen'"

[Verse 1]
I've got demons running round in my head
And they feed on insecurities I have
Won't you lay your healing hands on my chest?
Let your ritual clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Soak the ropes with your holy water
Tie me down as you read out the words

[Chorus]
Set me free from my jealousy
Won't you exorcise my mind?
Won't you exorcise my mind?
I want to be free as I'll ever be
Exorcise my mind
Help me exorcise my mind

[Verse 2]
Desdemona, won't you liberate me?
When I'm haunted by your ancient history
Close these green eyes and watch over as I sleep
Through my darkest of dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Be the power to compel me
Hold me closer than anyone before

[Chorus]
Set me free from my jealousy
Won't you exorcise my mind?
Won't you exorcise my mind?
I want to be free as I'll ever be
Exorcise my mind
Help me exorcise my mind

[Bridge]
I should be thinking 'bout nothing else when I'm with you-ou
With you-ou, ohohoh
I should be thinking 'bout nothing else when I'm with you-ou
With you-ou, ohohoh

[Intermezzo: spoken]
"Your mind exists somewhere altogether different; it lives in a world where feelings simply cannot be defined by words"

[Chorus]
Set me free from my jealousy
Won't you exorcise my mind?
Won't you exorcise my mind?
I want to be free as I'll ever be
Exorcise my mind
Help me exorcise my mind

Help me exorcise my mind
Won't you exorcise my mind?
