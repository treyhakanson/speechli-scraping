Title: Oblivion
Artist: Bastille

[Verse 1]
When you fall asleep
With your head upon my shoulder
When you're in my arms
But you've gone somewhere deeper

[Bridge]
Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to age without mistakes?
Are you going to age with grace?
Or only to wake and hide your face?

[Chorus]
When oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can

[Verse 2]
When you play it hard
And I try to follow you there
It's not about control
But I turn back when I see where you go

[Bridge]
Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to leave a path to trace?

[Chorus]
When oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can
When oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can
