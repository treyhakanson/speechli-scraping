Title: Electricity
Artist: Silk City & Dua Lipa

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Falling into you, baby
Even electricity can't compare to what I feel
When I’m with you
Ooh, baby
Giving up my ghost for you
And now I'm see-through

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I’ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
All I see is you, lately
Wide awake and in my dreams
I see your face so vividly
I don't know what I'd do
Ooh, baby
If you only saw a friend in me
I’d be bittersweet

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you’ve been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I’ll give you electricity
Give it to you

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know, I’ll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

[Bridge: Dua Lipa]
I feel electric, baby
So electric, baby
Wanna let you know, let you know, ooh
I think I'm ready, baby
I think I'm ready, now
Electricity, I'm flowing in to you
I feel electric, baby (I want it, I need it)
So electric, baby (This current between us)
Wanna let you know, let you know (This flow, this feeling tonight)
I think I'm ready, baby (I want it, I need it)
I think I'm ready, now (This current between us)
Electricity, I'm flowing in to you (This flow, this feeling tonight)

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna        let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

[Outro: Dua Lipa]
I feel electric, baby
So electric, baby
Wanna let you know, let you know
(I want it, I need it)
I think I'm ready, baby
(This current between us)
I think I'm ready, now
(This flow, this feeling)
Electricity (Woohoo)
I feel electric, baby
So electric, baby
Wanna let you know, let you know
I think I'm ready, baby
I think I'm ready, now
Electricity
