Title: Back to Black
Artist: Amy Winehouse

[Verse 1]
He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy
You went back to what you knew
So far removed
From all that we went through
And I tread my troubled track
My odds are stacked
I'll go back to black...

[Chorus]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
I go back to us

[Verse 2]
I loved you much;
It's not enough
You love blow
And I love puff
And life, is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rollin'
Up the walls inside

[Chorus]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to

[Bridge]
Black, black, black, black
Black, black, black
I go back to
I go back to

[Chorus]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to black
