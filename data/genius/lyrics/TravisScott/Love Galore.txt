Don't take it personal
Personally, I'm surprised you called me after the things I said
Skrt skrt on niggas (yah)

Skrt down, you acting like me (yah)
Acting like we wasn't more than a summer fling

Promise I won't cry over spilled milk (ooh no, I won't)
Gimme a paper towel, gimme another Valium
Gimme another hour or two, hour with you

[Pre-Chorus: SZA & Travis Scott]
Why you bother me when you know you don't want me? (yah)
Why you bother me when you know you got a woman? (yah)

Let me cum inside ya, let me plant that seed inside ya (ooh)

They think you stupid, you know what I'm saying?
