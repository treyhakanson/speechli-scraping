Title: Portland
Artist: Drake

[Intro: Drake & Baka]
Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Yeah
Itâ€™s a Habibis ting, ya?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic
'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now

[Hook: Quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes
Skrrt skrrt

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Quavo, young nigga, I invented you (ugh)
Ike Turner with the left hand (Ike)
Griselda Blanco with the trap moves (trap)
Gangland with the right hand (gang)
Undertaker with the tattoos
Never listen to the class rules (no)
Switch it up, they bit the last move (let's go!)
I'm a magnet for bad bitches
You got the goin' out sad bitches
I spent a fifty on the chain (racks)
You spent your last fifty (ugh, cash)
I got the keys to the streets (keys)
You got the key to defeat (defeat)
I got the keys to the warzone (brrrapt!)
You got the key to the peace (ugh)

[Hook: Quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep (yeah, yeah)
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep (yeah, yeah)
Gettin' loose off the Henny, 'Roc and a hint of Goose (yeah)
Ocean deep in my swimmin' pool (yeah, in my pool)
Throwin' Dead Prez in my livin' room (yeah, in my room)
Takin' shots, feelin' bulletproof
Flood my Rollie, told my bitch: "Let's go snorkelin'!" (yeah)
Out in Portland, tryna get in her organs (yeah)
No, I did not sign with Jay
But I still send a Tidal wave
Yeah, I might just go get the fade
Buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
Yeah, it's lit at the crib, you could stay
Me and Drake kick like Kid N' Play (Kid N' Play)
God the way that she servin' that cake
I gotta sit back and digest (straight up!)
I guess, for the fuck-shit I'm biased (yeah!)
I mix, double the cup when I stress
Got my momma out the basement (momma)
That's a different type of face lift
Free Max B up out the bracelets (yeah, yeah)
Don't hit us askin' what the wave is

[Hook: Quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes
Skrrt skrrt, oh
