[Verse 1: Drake]
I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks
Hit me when you done your shift
Wooh, I see you doin' well, baby
Oh, you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby
Is you single or what? I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky, I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me, someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club cashin' out with Eric
Then hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to
But we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin'
On some "why-you-love-these-strippers?" shit
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit, oh!
Oh, me, I don't deserve it (at least you fuckin' know it)
She's just a little too perfect, she's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man, I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog
Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer
Hit me when you're done your shift

[Hook: Drake]
I need some company, I need some company
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime
Some company

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby, heat baby
I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby
I'm in heat baby...
Mo City trip! Mo City trip right now! Yeah
I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
Ayy, ayy, a Mo City trip right now
Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
It's a couple faces in here that a nigga piped down
So let's go find a place that we can sip right now
Tour 'round the city, it's the shit right now
It's kinda lit right now that you're here right now
Pop a couple percs let's get it in right now
Saturday nights, off in my bed right now
Call up your girl and put them heels on
It's gettin' rowdy, rowdy right now, yeah
I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm a dog
I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby, heat baby
I'm a dog, I go ham, I'm a hog
Bitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'
By the way I broke her off
When she get too on, we take if off
Drink so long, for a year I didn't cough
Fantasizin' and fistin' and switchin' up positions
Do you mind if we just menage just a little?

[Outro: Travis Scott]
Mo City trip right now, Mo City trip right now
Mo City trip right now
