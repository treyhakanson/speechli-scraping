Title: Master of Puppets
Artist: Metallica

[Verse 1]
End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

[Refrain]
Taste me, you will see, more is all you need
Dedicated to how I'm killing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your...

[Chorus]
Master! Master!
Master of Puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!

[Verse 2]
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

[Refrain]
Taste me, you will see, more is all you need
Dedicated to how I'm killing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your...

[Chorus]
Master! Master!
Master of Puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!

[Post-Chorus]
(Master, master, master, master...)

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Bridge]
Master! Master! Where’s the dreams that I’ve been after?
Master! Master! You promised only lies
Laughter! Laughter! All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter! Laughter! Laughing at my cries
Fix me!

Make some hay!
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now, your life is out of season

[Refrain]
I will occupy, I will help you die
I will run through you, now I rule you too

[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your...

[Chorus]
Master! Master!
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!
