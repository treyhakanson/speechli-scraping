Title: Enter Sandman
Artist: Metallica

[Verse 1]
Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Until the sandman he comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

[Chorus]
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land

[Verse 2]
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war
Dreams of liars
Dreams of dragons fire
And of things that will bite, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

[Chorus]
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never-land

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
Now I lay me down to sleep
(Now I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the lord my soul to keep
(Pray the lord my soul to keep)
And
If I die before I wake
(If I die before I wake)
Pray the lord my soul to take
(Pray the lord my soul to take)

[Bridge]
Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed
In your closet, in your head

[Chorus]
Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never-land

[Interlude]
Come on people
Hey yeah, oh oh yeah

[Outro]
We're off to never never-land
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land
