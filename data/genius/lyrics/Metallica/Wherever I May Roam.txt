Title: Wherever I May Roam
Artist: Metallica

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
(And the road becomes my bride)
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need
And the dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, but I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah

[Verse 2]
(And the Earth becomes my throne)
And the Earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I have grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one!
And my ties are severed clean
Less I have the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will
Yeah you will!

[Chorus]
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I never mind anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah
That's right

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll take my time anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, that's right
Right here, right now

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
Carved upon my stone
My body lies, but still, I roam yeah yeah

[Outro]
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam, roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam, yeah
Wherever I may wander, wander, wander!
Wherever I may roam, yeah yeah
Wherever I may roam, yeah yeah
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
