Artist: Metallica

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

[Chours 1]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

[Verse 2]
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

[Chours 1]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

[Chours 2]
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh, God help me

[Chours 1]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me

[Bridge]
Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

[Verse 3]
Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

[Instrumental Outro]
