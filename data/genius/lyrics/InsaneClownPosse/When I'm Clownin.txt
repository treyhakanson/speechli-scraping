Title: When I'm Clownin
Artist: Insane Clown Posse

[Verse 1: Violent J]
When I'm clownin'
I get silly
Like something lace my Philly
Been known to pop a pilly
And cop a check with billy
When I'm clownin'
My heart beat poundin'
I sweat so much I'm drownin'
Because my shows astoundin'
And Faygo grape I'm downin'
When I'm clownin'
Aabrakadabra alakazam what have ya
Quick slight of hand I stab ya
Demons crawl out and grab ya
When I'm clownin'
There's plenty laughing
Blood on the walls what happened?
A massive murder stabbin
Cause wicked shit I'm blabbin
When I'm clownin'
Shit come alive
And don't no one survive
Off the light rig I dive
And this shit ain't no jive
When I'm clownin'

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
When I'm clownin'
I'm Psycoilly
Snatch out your icy grilly
I owes the mob a milli
Bout to knock off a Chili's
When I'm clownin'
Mad hoes I'm springin
They want my dingalingin
(Ooh let's fuck)
They singin
I keep my hatchet swingin'
When I'm clownin'
I I I'm super sick
Bones o bobber shoot you quick
Why you cuz youz a dick
Is he dead?
Poke him use a stick
When I'm clownin'
I'm heavy high powered
Mad energy devoured
The whole milky way sour
Let my acid rain shower
When I'm clownin'
Everything's a joke
That angel's wings are broke
So hot your speakers smoke
I freak this 'til I croak

[Interlude: Boondox]
Fresh off the red muds of Covington, Georgia
Running with the hatchet
Is Boondox with two wicked whoops for you
Danny Brown, show the underground
How you get down with the clown

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Take a whole eighth to the face
Anything on my mind right now been erased
And I taste that taste
Of a nice thin waist
Wanna pick that up
Put the pussy on my face
Ate a whole hand full of shrooms
Huffin' on balloons got me in a spinnin' room
All these pills I consume
Got me hollerin' at the moon
Like, what's that, kaboom
While IC fill the room
You don't really want it with me
You know it's Danny Brown with ICP
Grub her down low, bring her back for a G
But before you do that, lemme see ID
Bout to drop a deuce in my Faygo
Sippin like the west got me moving up in slow-mo
Oh no, let's go
Pass the blunt around
Them hoes gettin' pounded when I be clownin'
