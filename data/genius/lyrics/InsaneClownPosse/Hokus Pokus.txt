Title: Hokus Pokus
Artist: Insane Clown Posse

"Serial slaughtering stranglers
Jugular Juggling juggalos
Folded, fat, floppy-tittied freaks
I C fuckin P's in the house"

[Violent J]
Abracadabra boom shacka dae
I'm Violent J, and I'm back like a vertebrae
And I come with a hat full of tricks
Trunk full of Faygo, car full of fat chicks
Hahahahahahahaha, fuck you
Wicked clowns, we'd like to say what up to
The Cobra's, X-men, and Counts, and everybody with clown luv
Even sets I've never heard of
Roll into town, and out with the big top
Four cards down, and two more still to drop
And when it does, I pack up and hit the road
Cuz I don't wanna see your head explode
Toss me an axe, and I'll toss you a dead chicken
Add a buck, you get a two-liter with em
And when the genie says on with the show
It's hokus pokus jokers, Great Milenko

[Hook]
Once again, the psychotic carnival creatures in the house
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride
Southwest slithering snakes of darkness come
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Shazam BAM, shocka locka lokey
Shaggy the clown back like scoliosis
Call me a psycho-schizo freak
And I'll call you by your name (dick-anus)
Cuz I can give two shits and a fuck
I bounce down Verner in a popcorn clown truck
I'm a circus ninja southwest voodoo wizard
I grab your gizzard
Jump on the carpet, let's take a spin
Everybody's waitin for the show to begin
Up to the top, by the neck, and let you go
Try to land in a glass of Faygo
Uh, you suck, you missed the fuckin glass
Broken neck, and busted your fuckin ass
But the genie says on with the show
Hokus Pokus Jokers, Great Milenko

[Hook]
What awaits you after death, rub the lamp and explore
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride
Enter Milenko's Fun House, walk right through the wretched hall
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride

Fuck em all, fuck em all
Fuck em all, fuck em all
Clown dawg, freak dawg
Joker dawg, Milenko dawg

Fidgets of joker's cards blasting in your mother's face
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride

[Violent J]
Rude Boy and Chucky down with the clown
First time we ever went to Mexican Town
I remember, we couldn't pay the bill, they got hot
And beat us down in the fuckin parking lot

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Tall Jess, Jump Steady, and Nate the Mack
Tagged ICP by the train tracks
And it was on, the dawn of a new day
Magical carpets grippin' down the freeway

[Violent J]
Walked in a gypsy's tent with a food stamp
And walked out with a magical lamp, yeah
I met Milenko, he gave me 3 wishes
That night, I fucked 3 fat bitches

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Can't get the fuck with it? forget it
I'll rip your face off, and wipe my ass with it
When the genie says on with the show
Hokus pokus, jokers, Great Milenko

[Hook]
Climb aboard our magic train and join us inside
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride
City to village, hamlet to town, the show must go on
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride
Giant ladies, bearded ladies, midget ladies, ladies!
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride
Clowns of darkness and underneath them comes the cloud
Hokus pokus, joker's ride, come take a spin on a carnie ride

"Fuck dat!"
