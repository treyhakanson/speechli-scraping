Title: Miracles
Artist: Insane Clown Posse

[Intro - Violent J]
We got a theory
You see, Mike, we got a theory
About magic, and miracles
[Shaggy 2 Dope] That's right, that's right

[Verse 1]
[VJ] If magic is all we've ever known
Then it's easy to miss what really goes on
But I've seen miracles in every way
[S2D] And I see miracles every day
Oceans spanning beyond my sight
[VJ] And a million stars way above 'em at night
We don't have to be high to look in the sky
And know that's a miracle opened wide
[S2D] Look at the mountains, trees, the seven seas
[VJ] And everything chilling underwater, please!
Hot lava, snow, rain and fog
[S2D] Long neck giraffes, pet cats and dogs
[VJ] And I've seen eighty-five thousand people
All in one room, together as equal
[S2D] Pure magic is the birth of my kids
I've seen shit that'll shock your eyelids
[VJ] The sun and the moon, and even Mars
[S2D] The Milky Way and fucking shooting stars
[VJ] UFOs, [S2D] a river flows
[VJ] Plant a little seed and nature grows
[S2D] Niagara Falls and the pyramids
[VJ] Everything you believed in as kids
[S2D] Fucking rainbows, after it rains
There's enough miracles here to blow your brains
[VJ] I fed a fish to a pelican at Frisco Bay
It tried to eat my cell phone, [S2D] he ran away
[VJ] And music is magic, pure and clean
You can feel it and hear it but it can't be seen

[Chorus]
(Are you a believer in miracles?)
[VJ] Music is all magic
You can't even hold it
(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)
It's just there in the air
(Are you a believer in miracles?)
[S2D] Pure motherfuckin' magic [VJ] Right?
[S2D] This shit'll blow your motherfuckin' mind
(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)

[Verse 2]
[VJ] Music is a lot like love, it's all a feeling
And it fills the room from the floor to the ceiling
[S2D] I see miracles all around me
Stop and look around, it's all astounding
[VJ] Water, fire, air and dirt
[S2D] Fucking magnets, how do they work?
And I don't wanna talk to a scientist
Y'all motherfuckers lying, and getting me pissed
[VJ] Solar eclipse, and vicious weather
[S2D] Fifteen thousand Juggalos together
[VJ] And I love my mom, for giving me this
Time on this planet, taking nothing for granted
I seen a caterpillar turn into a butterfly
[S2D] Miracles ain't nothing to lie
[VJ] Shaggy's little boys look just like Shaggy
And my little boy looks just like daddy
[S2D] Miracles each and everywhere you look
And nobody has to stay where they put
This world is yours, for you to explore
[VJ] It's nothing but miracles beyond your door
The Dark Carnival is your invitation
[S2D] To witness that without explanation
[VJ] Take a look at this fine creation
[S2D] And enjoy it better with appreciation
[VJ] Crows, ghosts, [S2D] the midnight coast
[VJ] The wonders of the world, [S2D] mysteries the most
[VJ] Just open your mind, and it ain't no way
[S2D] To ignore the miracles of every day
[VJ] And that's real

[Chorus]
(Are you a believer in miracles?)
[VJ] Magic everywhere in this bitch
(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)
[S2D] It's all around you, you don't even know it
(Are you a believer in miracles?) Shit's crazy
(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)
(So many miracles, the magic miracles)

[Outro]
Are you a believer in miracles?
Do you have time for the miracles?
Do you notice and recognize miracles?
So many miracles, the magic miracles

[Skit]
Well, we're here! We came all the way to Ash, Nevada!
Come on!
Where's the show and where's our money?
I came all the way from England! Where's me bloody 'undred thousand pounds?
What I wanna know is where in hell is my goddamn hundred thousand dollars?
And where can I get some beer in this motherfucker?
I thought this was a carnival. Where's all the sexy kids at? Don't tell me I brought all this candy for nothing!
I didn't come all this way to stand around here with all these goddamn tadpoles! Let's get a move on!
Start this shit so we can get paid!
We came a long way to see this shit! It'd better be worth it, or Imma kill somebody! Fuck that!
