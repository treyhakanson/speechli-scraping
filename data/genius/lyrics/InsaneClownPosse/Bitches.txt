Bitches!

Ha Ha Ha!
Bitches, Ha!
Bitches...

[Old Dirty Bastard]
BITCH, at any moment, that's what I'll do
[You fucking bitches]I'll do it to you
And a few of your crew
At any moment[Yeah], that's what I'll do
[ICP, ODB]I'll do it to you
And a few of your crew
[Bitcheeessss!]

[Verse 1: Violent J]
BITCH! WHAT THE FUCK?!
What are you trying to do to me?
You wasn't true to me
When I was locked up you fucked something like 34 guys
[Rrrghh!]But I let that slide
'Cuz your ass is big, and your titties is fat
I wanted to FUCK THAT
But FUCK THAT
I never gave a FUCK THAT, you put me through the courts [AND?]
And gave me genital warts
Now I stack my .9, I'm goin' for the knees
I'mma blow 'em out and give your neck a squeeze
[Aggghhh! Whoo!]As you're standing there, I'mma be like BITCH!
[Ha ha!]You know you done fucked up, right?

[Hook: Violent J]
Girl you know I love you, but now you gotta die
[Now you gotta die, now you gotta die]
Girl you know I love you, but now you gotta DIE
[Never wanted it like that] (x2)

[2nd Verse- Old Dirty Bastard]
Bitch, don't talk about bitches I'm fucking them
Please no fat bitches I'm fucking slim
Unless it's one of those likes stroking my shit
I don't care 'bout how I'm fucking it
How much it costs, big fat...crackhead?
Ain't trying to hear all those words you said
Five minutes, bitch [ahhhh] and I came
Fuck your name, and from where you came

I don't give a fuck, bitch! I will kill you!
You Shaquita! You Belinda! You too Passion...BITCH!

[Hook]
[Ahhhhh....you bitches!!!]

[Verse 3: Shaggy 2 Dope]
One thing I can't stand is these bitches
Trying to take my riches, when I ain't even got none [Bitch!]
I never lied, you knew what I wanted all the while [what?]
My dick in your vertical smile [yeah]
We kiss and hug, and snugg, and tickle
But the bitch wouldn't even buff my fucking pickle [bitch]
You fucked everybody else in the place, it's all good
Now let me head-butt your face!

Bitch! I love you, but now you gotta die
That's right [Bitches!], that's right
Girl you know I love you, but now you gotta die
[Bitches? Bitcheeesss!]

[Hook x3]
Girl you know I love you, you dumb bitch!
