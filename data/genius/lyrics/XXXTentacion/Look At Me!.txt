I'm like, "Bitch, who is your mans?" (Ayy)
Can't keep my dick in my pants (Ayy)
My bitch don't love me no mo' (Ayy)
She kick me out, I'm like, "Vro" (Ayy)

[Verse 2]
I took a white bitch to Starbucks
That little bitch got her throat fucked
I like to rock out like I'm misfit
My emo bitch like her wrist slit
Curly hair bitch like I'm Corbin
Got like three bitches, I'm Mormon
Skeet on your main bitch's forehead
Don't want your pussy, just want head

[Chorus]
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, yah, ayy!
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, yah!
