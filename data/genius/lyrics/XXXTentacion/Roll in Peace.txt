[Intro: Kodak Black]
Ayy, everything be like, off the top these days like
(We got London on the track!)
These days, I don't even know what a pad is these days, ya know
Fuck that hoe 'cause she a nat nat

[Pre-Chorus: Kodak Black]
You ain't the one for me, baby
You ain't got shit I need, bitch
You want me to take my time with you
Well maybe I'm not your speed bitch
Maybe I'm out your league, bitch
You ain't even got no cheese, bitch
Maybe I'm just too G for you
Or maybe I'm just too street, bitch

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I can't even roll in peace (Why?)
Everybody notice me (Yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (Why?)
I'm rolling on a bean (Yeah)
They tried to give me eight
Got on my knees like, "Jesus, please"
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus piece?
If you wanna leave just leave, but you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see (Fuck)
That you ain't gon' ride for me
You ain't even showing me the love you say you got for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
You said that you gon' ride for me

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Baby, that's blasphemy, yeah
Baby, you're bad for me, yeah
Say you gon' clap for me, yeah
Say you gon' blast for me, yeah
Why you ain't show me none of the love you say you have for me?, yeah
I was goin' through tragedy
Bitch, I needed you drastically, yeah
I'ma just switch my flow up, yeah
Maybe I'm sick, no throw up, yeah
Maybe I'm sick, no check up, yeah
Boy, you need to run your check up, yeah
I'm eatin' on you niggas, no ketchup, yeah
I'm eatin' on you niggas, can't catch up, ayy
Hit her face down with her ass up, ayy
Even when I'm fucking, I'm masked up, ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Kodak Black]
You ain't the one for me, baby
You ain't got shit I need, bitch
You want me to take my time with you
Well maybe I'm not your speed bitch
Maybe I'm out your league, bitch
You ain't even got no cheese, bitch
Maybe I'm just too G for you
Or maybe I'm just too street, bitch

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I can't even roll in peace (Why?)
Everybody notice me (Yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (Why?)
I'm rolling on a bean (Yeah)
They tried to give me eight
Got on my knees like, "Jesus, please"
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus piece?
If you wanna leave just leave, but you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see (Fuck)
That you ain't gon' ride for me
You ain't even showing me the love you say you got for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
And you say that you gon' ride with me

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
I ain't gon' do the nigga shit, 'cause I'm too good for features, huh
I ain't gon' fuck the nigga bitch, 'cause I know she a eater, ayy
Last time I wifed a bitch she told the world I beat her, huh
And when they locked lil' Kodak up, my nigga, I couldnâ€™t believe it, huh
Ayy, lil' shawty, pop my whoadie
Pockets on Pinocchio, poking, yuh
Hit her from the back, damn, that bitch bleeding
Said I knocked her period on
Remember when I had that poker, huh
Instead of looking over my shoulder, huh
Forces with a nigga, no Yoda, huh
That mean a young nigga got woo on me (Ayy)

[Pre-Chorus: Kodak Black]
You ain't the one for me, baby
You ain't got shit I need, bitch
You want me to take my time with you
Well maybe I'm not your speed, bitch
Maybe I'm out your league, bitch
You ain't even got no cheese, bitch
Maybe I'm just too G for you
Or maybe I'm just too street, bitch

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I can't even roll in peace (Why?)
Everybody notice me (Yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (Why?)
I'm rolling on a bean (Yeah)
They tried to give me eight
Got on my knees like, "Jesus, please"
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus piece?
If you wanna leave just leave, but you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see (Fuck)
That you ain't gon' ride for me
You ain't even showing me the love you say you got me for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
You say that you gon' ride for me, ayy

[Outro: Kodak Black]
I'm in London, got my beat from London
