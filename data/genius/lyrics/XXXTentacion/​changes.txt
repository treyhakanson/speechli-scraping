Artist: XXXTENTACION

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this
You're changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel, can't stand it
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this
You're changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel, can't stand it
Mmm, baby, I don't understand it

[Bridge: PnB Rock]
Girl, you're makin' it hard for me
Girl, you're makin' it hard for me
Girl, you're makin' it hard for me
Mmm, ohh
Girl, you're makin' it hard for me
Girl, you're makin' it hard for me
Girl, you're makin' it hard for me

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & PnB Rock]
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this
You're changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel, can't stand it
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this
You're changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel, can't stand it
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
You're changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel, can't stand it
Mmm, baby, I don't understand it
