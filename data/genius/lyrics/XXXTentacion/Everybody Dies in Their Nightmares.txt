Title: Everybody Dies in Their Nightmares
Artist: XXXTENTACION

[Intro: Shiloh Dynasty]
Ooh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Don't go, don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
Only time I feel pain, when I'm feelin' love
That's why it's tatted on my face that I'm damn numb
Only time I'm in my mind, when I'm all alone
That's why I'm never really alone in the night time
Change hoes like clothes, I can't get attached
'Cause these hoes fire starters like lit matches
I've been feelin' really lost, duckin' all attachments
I don't really go outside 'cause I hate traffic
I don't wanna go outside, get caught in traffic, traffic

[Bridge: Shiloh Dynasty]
Ooh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Don’t go, don’t go to sleep
Don’t go, stay up and

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Nigga really wanna die in the night time, uh
Nigga really wanna die in the night time, uh
Nigga really wanna die in the night time

[Outro: Shiloh Dynasty]
Don’t go to sleep
Don’t go, stay up and
Don't go, don’t go to sleep
Don’t go, stay up and don't
Ooooahahh
Don’t go, don’t go to sleep
Don’t go, stay up and don't
