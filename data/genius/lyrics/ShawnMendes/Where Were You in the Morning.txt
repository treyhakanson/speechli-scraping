Title: Where Were You in the Morning
Artist: Shawn Mendes

[Verse 1]
You said, "I wanna get to know ya"
Why you gotta get my hopes up?
You said that you were staying over
But then I woke up to the cold air

[Refrain]
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

[Chorus]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Where were you in the morning, baby?

[Post-Chorus]
How do you, how do you just walk away?
How do you, how do you just walk away?

[Verse 2]
And I thought you really felt this
When we were talking about breakfast
You made it seem like we connected
I guess I just didn't expect this

[Refrain]
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

[Chorus]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
I said where were you in the morning, baby?

[Post-Chorus]
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?

[Bridge]
And I hope you had a good reason
'Cause I know you had a good time
And I'm looking up at the ceiling
And I keep wondering why

[Chorus]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
Where were you in the morning?
You didn't leave your number for me
You didn't leave your number
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Left me without a warning
I said, where were you in the morning baby?
Where were you in the morning?

[Post-Chorus]
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where  were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
