that the power was harnessed in that basement\nIt ain't about the money and notoriety\nIt's about the people and making a difference in society\nBut don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie\nThe Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi\nOne with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?\nSame level, the same rebel that never settled\nPullin' strings like Geppetto who overcame the ghetto\nAnd I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered\n'Cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me, different stances\nI used to spend all my time conversing with you\nBut now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you\nShit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet\nBesides the shows and meet and greets, y'all only see me on the street\nAnd even then, that shit is rare\u2014I just don't go outside\n'Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide\nThat misconception, \"'Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride\"\nShit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied\nPeople in my ear telling me, \"Talk that shit\"\nActions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit\nSince the first album, I'm one of the highest earners on the label\nWithin six months I put the second one on they table\nI played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce\nRelease the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce\nFuck all that murderous syllable shit right now, just let me bounce\nThe mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce\nLeave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand\nDon't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand\nYou know my first week looking crazy due to high demand\n'Cause people don't buy music in this day and age, they buy the brand\nThere's ups and downs, don't get me wrong but back when I ain't have shit\nFelt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit\nThank God, he never let Lucifer close enough to ask\nLet me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass\nAchieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?\nAt least I don't drink to avoid the hurt, we call that champagne\n\n[Outro]\nCome

A friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wondering how things are going.
