Title: Make Room
Artist: Casting Crowns

[Verse 1]
Family hiding from the storm
Found no place at the keeper's door
It was for this a Child was born
To save a world so cold and hollow

[Verse 2]
The sleeping town did not know
That lying in a manger low
A Savior King who had no home
Has come to heal our sorrows

[Chorus 1]
Is there room in your heart?
Is there room in your heart?
Is there room in your heart
For God to write His story?

[Verse 3]
Shepherds counting sheep in the night
Do not fear the glory light
You are precious in His sight
God has come to raise the lowly

[Chorus 2]
Is there room in your heart?
Is there room in your heart?
Is there room in your heart
For God to write His story?
You can come as you are
But it may set you apart
When you make room in your heart
And trade your dreams for His glory

[Bridge]
Make room in your heart
Make room in your heart

[Verse 4]
Mother holds the Promise tight
Every wrong will be made right
The road is straight and the burden's light
For in His hands He holds tomorrow

[Chorus 2]
Is there room in your heart?
Is there room in your heart?
Is there room in your heart
For God to write His story?
You can come as you are
But it may set you apart
When you make room in your heart
And trade your dreams for His glory

[Outro]
Make room in your heart
Make room in your heart
Make room in your heart
Make room in your heart

[Instrumental]
