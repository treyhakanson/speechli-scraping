Title: Who Am I
Artist: Casting Crowns

[Verse 1]
Who am I, that the Lord of all the earth
Would care to know my name
Would care to feel my hurt?
Who am I, that the Bright and Morning Star
Would choose to light the way
For my ever wandering heart?

[Pre-Chorus]
Not because of who I am
But because of what You've done
Not because of what I've done
But because of who You are

[Chorus]
I am a flower quickly fading
Here today and gone tomorrow
A wave tossed in the ocean
A vapor in the wind
Still, You hear me when I'm calling
Lord, You catch me when I'm falling
And You've told me who I am
I am Yours, I am Yours

[Verse 2]
Who am I, that the eyes that see my sin
Would look on me with love and watch me rise again?
Who am I, that the voice that calmed the sea
Would call out through the rain
And calm the storm in me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Not because of who I am
But because of what You've done
Not because of what I've done
But because of who You are

[Chorus]
I am a flower quickly fading
Here today and gone tomorrow
A wave tossed in the ocean
A vapor in the wind
Still, You hear me when I'm calling
Lord, You catch me when I'm falling
And You've told me who I am
I am Yours

[Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus]
Not because of who I am
But because of what You've done
Not because of what I've done
But because of who You are

[Chorus]
I am a flower quickly fading
Here today and gone tomorrow
A wave tossed in the ocean
A vapor in the wind
Still, You hear me when I'm calling
Lord, You catch me when I'm falling
You told me who I am
I am Yours
I am Yours, I am Yours

[Outro]
Whom shall I fear? Whom shall I fear?
'Cause I am Yours, I am Yours

[Instrumental]
