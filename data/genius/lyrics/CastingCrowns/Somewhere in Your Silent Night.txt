Title: Somewhere in Your Silent Night
Artist: Casting Crowns

[Verse 1]
All is calm and all is bright
Everywhere but in your heart tonight
They're singing carols of joy and peace
But you feel too far gone and too far out of reach

[Chorus]
Somewhere in your silent night
Heaven hears the song your broken heart has cried
Hope is here, just lift your head
For love has come to find you
Somewhere in your silent night

[Verse 2]
From Heaven's height to manger low
There is no distance the Prince of Peace won't go
From manger low to Calvary's hill
When your pain runs deep, His love runs deeper still
He has always loved you, child
And He always will

[Chorus]
Somewhere in your silent night
Heaven hears the song your broken heart has cried
Hope is here, just lift your head
For love has come to find you
Somewhere in your silent night

[Bridge]
Lift your head, lift your heart
Emmanuel will meet you where you are
He knows your hurt, He knows your name
And you're the very reason that He came

[Chorus]
Somewhere in your silent night
Heaven hears the song your broken heart has cried
Hope is here, just lift your head
For love has come to find you
Somewhere in your silent night...

[Outro]
Love will find you
Love will find you
Love will find you
