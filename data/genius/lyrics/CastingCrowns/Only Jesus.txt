Title: Only Jesus
Artist: Casting Crowns

[Verse 1]
Make it count, leave a mark, build a name for yourself
Dream your dreams, chase your heart, above all else
Make a name the world remembers
But all an empty world can sell is empty dreams
I got lost in the lie that it was up to me
To make a name the world remembers
But Jesus is the only name to remember

[Chorus]
And I-I-I, I don't want to leave a legacy
I don't care if they remember me
Only Jesus
And I-I-I, I've only got one life to live
I'll let every second point to Him
Only Jesus

[Verse 2]
All the kingdoms built, all the trophies won
Will crumble into dust when it's said and done
'Cause all that really matters
Did I live the truth to the ones I love?
Was my life the proof that there is only One
Whose name will last forever?

[Chorus]
And I-I-I, I don't want to leave a legacy
I don't care if they remember me
Only Jesus
And I-I-I, I've only got one life to live
I'll let every second point to Him
Only Jesus

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Jesus is the only name, Jesus is the only name
Jesus is the only name to remember, ooh
Jesus is the only name, Jesus is the only name
Jesus is the only name to remember

[Chorus]
And I-I-I, I don't want to leave a legacy
I don't care if they remember me
Only Jesus
And I-I-I, I've only got one life to live
I'll let every second point to Him
Only Jesus

[Outro]
I, I don't want to leave a legacy
I don't care if they remember me
Only Jesus
