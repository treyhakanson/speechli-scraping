Title: In the Hands of the Potter
Artist: Casting Crowns

[Verse 1]
I still remember when I heard You call me by name
I'd follow You anywhere, knew I could trust You in anything
But now sorrow beats down on me, waiting for You to come through
I'm all alone with my questions, I'm dry and cracked open
And I thirst for You

[Chorus]
And as I fall apart
Come flood this desert heart
Fall like the rain, Living Water
And I know Your way is best
Lord, help me find my rest
And I'll be the clay
In the Hands of the Potter

[Verse 2]
My world is spinning, my life seems so out of control
Nailed, scarred hands tell the story of love that will never let go of me
Through the sunshine or rain, I know where my hope is found
What You started in me, I know You will complete from the inside out

[Chorus]
And as I fall apart
Come flood this desert heart
Fall like the rain, Living Water
And I know Your way is best
Lord, help me find my rest
And I'll be the clay
In the Hands of the Potter

[Bridge]
My world is breaking me, Your love is shaping me
And now the enemy is afraid of what You're making me
When my world is breaking me, Your love is shaping me
And now the enemy is afraid of what You're making me
My world is breaking me, Your love is shaping me
And now the enemy is afraid of what You're making me

[Chorus]
And as I fall apart
Come flood this desert heart
Fall like the rain, Living Water
And I know Your way is best
Lord, help me find my rest
And I'll be the clay
In the Hands of the Potter

[Outro]
And I'll be the clay
In the Hands of the Potter
