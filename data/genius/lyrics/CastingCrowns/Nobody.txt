Title: Nobody
Artist: Casting Crowns

[Verse 1: Mark Hall]
Why You ever chose me
Has always been a mystery
All my life, I've been told I belong
At the end of a line
With all the other Not-Quites
With all the Never-Get-It-Rights
But it turns out they are the ones You were looking for
All this time

[Chorus: Mark Hall & Matthew West]
'Cause I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody
All about Somebody who saved my soul
Ever since You rescued me, You gave my heart a song to sing
I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus

[Verse 2: Matthew West]
Moses had stage fright
And David brought a rock to a sword fight
You picked twelve outsiders nobody would've chosen
And You changed the world
Well, the moral of the story is
Everybody's got a purpose
So when I hear that devil start talking to me, saying
"Who do you think you are?" I say

[Chorus: Mark Hall & Matthew West]
I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody
All about Somebody who saved my soul
Ever since You rescued me, You gave my heart a song to sing
I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus

[Bridge: [Megan Garrett?] & Mark Hall]
So let me go down, down, down in history
As another blood-bought  faithful member of the family
And if they all forget my name, well, that's fine with me
I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
So let me go down, down, down in history (Go down in history)
As another blood-bought faithful member of the family (It's all I ever wanna be)
And if they all forget my name, well, that's fine with me
I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus, yeah!

[Chorus: Mark Hall & Matthew West]
I'm just a nobody (Nobody)
Trying to tell everybody
All about Somebody
Who saved my soul (Oh, saved my, saved my soul)
Ever since You rescued me
You gave my heart a song to sing (You gave me a song to sing)
I'm living for the world to see
Nobody but Jesus (Nobody but You, Lord)
I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus

[Outro: Mark Hall & Matthew West]
I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
