Title: Revenge
Artist: P!nk

[Intro: P!nk]
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm

[Verse 1: P!nk]
Like Leo in The Revenant
Abel in that Bible bit
Revenge is sweet, isn't it?
Really, really hope for it
I know that it won't fix a thing
A song like this that I could sing for you
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
All the feels you make me do
A nightmare fuckin' comin' true
I wish I was a lawyer, I would sue you
Sue you, take your dog, take your house
Take your shoes, take your heart
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
And now here comes that singin' part

[Pre-Hook: P!nk]
I'm daydreamin', let me count the ways
How I'll get you or how I'll make you pay
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
Babe, I'm hurtin' and now you'll feel the same
That's my plan, that's my plan, that's my plan, mhm
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)

[Hook: P!nk]
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (now, now)

[Verse 2: P!nk]
Now here's where girlfriends come in hand
Especially those that understand
Crime's a crime, but listen, man
Really cannot give a damn
We've all been through this kind of thing
Say the word, we make it sting for him
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
He can't just get away with it
Eye for eye, you piece of sh—
You treat us like a garbage pit
Let me at him, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
Here's that singin' part again
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)

[Pre-Hook: P!nk]
I'm daydreamin' (I'm daydreamin')
Let me count the ways (let me count the ways)
How I'll get you (how I'll get you)
Or how I'll make you pay (you pay)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
Babe, I'm hurtin' (I'm hurtin')
And now you'll feel the same (feel the same)
That's my plan, that's my plan, that's my plan
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)

[Hook: P!nk]
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (revenge is sweet)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Well, in the beginning we
Felt like we was meant to be
I fell for you and skinned my knee
But hell, with any injury, eventually you'll get up gingerly
Feels like it'll take a century to heal
But just know that I will
(Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm)
But fuck tryna make amends, I'd rather take revenge
You're stickin' safety pins inside my atrium
Your day begins at 8 p.m.
You hit the ATM in my Mercedes Benz
With all your lady friends—whores!
Hit the club and you go out
Don't know a sum, 'cause when I calculate
The times you cheated and I total up all the amounts
It doesn't add up, 'cause you say that just givin' out your number doesn't count, get it? (I hate you)
And then see me with someone new, get mad and flip it, look how bad you spin it
First you turn your back on me, then tell me that I stabbed you in it?!
(Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it, SLUT!)
So when you're driving, driving to his house
And you pass me, while I'm drivin' to hers
Just remember, you cheated on me first (bitch!)
You're a whore, you're a whore, this is war
Fellas, ladies

[Hook: Eminem & P!nk]
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together (oh-ohh)
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (so sweet, oh-ohh)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet

[Outro: Eminem & P!nk]
Fuck yeah!
Fuck no!
