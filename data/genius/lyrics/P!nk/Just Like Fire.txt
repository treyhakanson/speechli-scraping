Title: Just Like Fire
Artist: P!nk

[Verse 1]
I know that I am runnin' out of time
I want it all, mmm, mmm
And I'm wishin' they'd stop tryin' to turn me off
I want it on, mmm, mmm
And I'm walkin' on a wire, tryin' to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all, mmm, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

[Chorus]
Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic,  I'll be flyin' free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, uh

[Verse 2]
And people like to laugh at you cause they are all the same, mmm, mmm
See I would rather we just go a different way than play the game
And no matter the weather, we can do it better
You and me together, forever and ever
We don't have to worry 'bout a thing, 'bout a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

[Chorus]
Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic,  I'll be flyin' free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, fire, fire
Run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

[Verse 3]
So look, I came here to run it
Just cause nobody's done it
Y'all don't think I can run it
But look, I been here, I done it
Impossible? Please
Watch, I do it with ease
You just gotta believe
Come uh, come uh with me
Oh, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Hey, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Oh, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Mmmm, what's a girl to do?

[Bridge: Acoustic]
Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way

[Chorus]
Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic,  I'll be flyin' free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, fire

[Outro]
Run it, run it, run it
Just like fire
Run it, run it, run it
