Title: Love More
Artist: Chris Brown

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
You say all you need is consistent love
When I try I swear it’s never enough, I messed up
Maybe this thing here just ain’t meant for us
Baby you let go and I pull you back, I let go, you ain't having that

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
We do it like we rock stars
Sexing in my hotel room, we be so loud
Higher than a smoke cloud
Shades on, doing 95 with the top down
I might sound crazy
Cause we be going back and forth
One minute I hate you, and I love you
That’s just how it is

[Hook: Chris Brown]
‘Til we get it right we gon' fuck some more, ‘til we get it
I'ma get it, I'ma get it, 'til we get it, 'til we get it
'Til we get it right we gon’ fuck some more, I'ma get it
I'ma get it, 'til we get it, 'til we get it, I'ma get it, turn up

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Why is it all so complicated?
Baby this should be simple, it’s driving me mental
But when you back it up it really drives me crazy
And you know what I’m into, make me forget what we arguing about, ay

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
We do it like we rock stars
Sexing in my hotel room, we be so loud
Higher than a smoke cloud
Shades on, doing 95 with the top down
I might sound crazy
Cause we be going back and forth
One minute I hate you, and I love you
That’s just how it is

[Hook: Chris Brown]
‘Til we get it right we gon' fuck some more, ‘til we get it
I'ma get it, I'ma get it, 'til we get it, 'til we get it
'Til we get it right we gon’ fuck some more, I'ma get it
I'ma get it, 'til we get it, 'til we get it, I'ma get it

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, he don’t know me but he setting up to blow me, uh
Said my Twitter picture remind him of Naomi, uh
On the low I used to holla at his homie, uh
Fuck it, now I’m 'bout to ride him like a pony, yeah
Okay, thug prolly, yo come polly
He wanna fuck a bad Dolly and pop Molly
I hope your pockets got a muthafuckin' pot belly
Or is it that you never ball? John Salley
He had the Rolls in his Royce, the tone in his voice
Don’t want a good girl, naw, hoes is his choice
D-D-Dick on H, pussy on W
Mouth on open, ass on smother you
Ass on the cover too, Elle Magazine
Vroom, vroom, vroom, get gasoline
Could I be your wife? Naw, we could bang though
I got these niggas whipped, call me Django

[Hook: Chris Brown]
‘Til we get it right we gon' fuck some more, ‘til we get it
I'ma get it, I'ma get it, 'til we get it, 'til we get it
'Til we get it right we gon’ fuck some more, I'ma get it
I'ma get it, 'til we get it, 'til we get it, I'ma get it
