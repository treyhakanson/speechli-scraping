[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Another one
We The Best Music!

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, he ain't messin' with no average chick, pop, pop
He got Nicki, he know that he hit the jackpot
Every baller tryna score, check them shot clocks
But I hit 'em with them 'Bron-Iguodala blocks
Eat the cake and he suck on my toes, yes
Hittin' them home runs, I be like "Go Mets!"
I want a dude that still kiss me when he mad
Type to cop me diamonds, he can miss me with them bags

[Pre-Chorus: August Alsina, Chris Brown & DJ Khal,ed]
Girl, we been right here, thinkin' 'bout it all night (Oh)
Baby, you should be up in my bed, ooh
Do you mind, do you mind? Baby, you (DJ Khaled)
Do you mind? Do-do you mind? Do you mind?

[Chorus: Chris Brown & August Alsina]

Get a little closer, maybe post up, ooh
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Do you mind? Do-do you mind? Do you mind?

Oh, do you mind if I talk to you?
And do you mind if I touch you there?
Girl, you know you can't do no better, baby

Let's not waste the time
You ain't gotta hold back (Hold back) 'cause once I get inside
You won't change your mind, you know that you can take it
No need to hesitate, I need it, impatient (Yeah)
I'm not used to waiting (Yeah, yeah), I want you to give it to me
Come on let me taste it, until I get enough
Hope you're ready 'cause I'ma beat it up
Do you mind when I'ma have it? Know how to heat it up, yeah

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
I should, I should be the one, baby, you gon' learn that
Girl, I know your body, know where every curve at
We be going all night, 'til the early
Know you, know you wanna take off when you on my runway
We ain't gotta talk, bodies conversate
Baby, by the way I touch you, you know what I'm saying
Oh, oh, oh, ride it slow
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown & August Alsina]

Man with all this red carpet shit, baby
You know what I'm saying, Future Hendrix

[Verse 4: Future & Rick Ross]
I'ma do that favor, drippin' flavor in you two piece
I'ma keep my promise, never treat you like a groupie
Calamari dinners, got you eatin' raw sushi
Still in the trap, but I like my bitches bougie
Two cups of styrofoam, excuse me lil' mama
I can hold you down, be your friend and your lover (Brrrp)
You want watches, new Versaces, you want CÃ©line (Ugh!)
Top back, screamin' money ain't a ting (Boss)

[Verse 5: Rick Ross]
Seein' two G-wagons in my driveway (Woo!)
FaceTime, two black bottles by my fireplace (Ugh!)
Fell out with your peoples so you took the pictures down (Yeah)
Instagram ain't been the same since you so distant now (Woo!)
Took you shoppin' in other places that I won't name (Boss)
First time your friends really got to see Balmain (Woo!)
20 million cash, seen it there with my two eyes (Ugh!)
We the best and I told you this back in '05
(Maybach Music)

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Ooh, just in case you need me, I don't mind, uh
Yo, tell them what to do, tell them what to do
Tell them what to do
When you see a bad bitch in front of you, baby
Yeah, assume the position
