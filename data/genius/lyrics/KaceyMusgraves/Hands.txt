Title: Hands
Artist: Various Artists

[Verse 1: Britney Spears + Gwen Stefani]
Can hold a gun
And hold your heart
Can put out fires
And make 'em start
Skin and bones
And flesh and blood
With all this nerve
How did we get this numb

[Pre-Chorus: Meghan Trainor + Troye Sivan]
Cus they can hurt
Or they can heal
They can give back
Or they can steal
They can break the world
Or they can change it too

[Chorus: All Together]
Ooh hands
Hands
Woooo hands
Oh hands
Cause they can love
Or they can take
They can fight up
Until they save
They can break the world
They can change it too
Ooh hands

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez + Kacey Musgraves]
Doesn't matter
Who you love
All that matters
Is your love
I've been watching news
And seeing all this hate
Tell me is it wrong
To want a little change

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
They can hurt
Or they can heal
They can give back
Or they can steal
They can break the world
Or they can change it too

[Chorus: All Together led by Jason Derulo]
Ooh hands
Hands
Woooo hands
Oh hands
Cause they can love
Or they can take
They can fight up
Until they save
They can break the world
They can change it too
Ooh hands

[Post-Chorus: Led by Imagine Dragons]
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
Ooooh

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez + Britney Spears]
Can hold a gun
And hold your heart
Can put out fires
And make 'em start
I've been watching news
And seeing all this hate
Tell me is it wrong
To want a little change

[Chorus:  Adam Lambert & Tyler Glenn + P!NK & MNEK]
Ooh hands
Hands
Woooo hands
Oh hands
Cause they can love
Or they can take
They can fight up
Until they save
They can break the world
They can change it too
Ooh hands

[Post-Chorus: Led by Imagine Dragons]
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
Ooooh

[Outro: RuPaul + (Mary Lambert) +  Nate Ruess + Together]
Just take my hand baby
Everybody say love
(All that matters is your love)
(Change it or break it)
(They can love or they can take it, take it all)
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
Ooooh
