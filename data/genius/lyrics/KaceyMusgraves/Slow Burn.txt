Title: Slow Burn
Artist: Kacey Musgraves

[Verse 1]
Born in a hurry, always late
Haven't been early since '88
Texas is hot, I can be cold
Grandma cried when I pierced my nose
Good in a glass, good on green
Good when you're putting your hands all over me

[Chorus]
I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn, yeah

[Verse 2]
In Tennessee, the sun's goin' down
But in Beijing, they're heading out to work
You know the bar down the street don't close for an hour
We should take a walk and look at all the flowers

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn

[Bridge]
Whatever feels good

[Outro]
Old soul, waiting my turn
I know a few things, but I still got a lot to learn
So I'm alright with a slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
I'm alright with a slow burn
