Title: Butterflies
Artist: Kacey Musgraves

[Verse 1]
I was just coastin', never really goin' anywhere
Caught up in a web, I was gettin' kinda used to stayin' there
And out of the blue, I fell for you

[Chorus 1]
Now you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

[Verse 2]
Kiss full of color makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new all because of you

[Chorus 1]
And now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, yeah
You give me butterflies

[Chorus 2]
Now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
You're taking my hand 'stead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies
You give me butterflies
