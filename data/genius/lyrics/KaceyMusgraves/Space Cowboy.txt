Title: Space Cowboy
Artist: Kacey Musgraves

[Verse 1]
You look out the window while I look at you
Saying "I don't know"
Would be like saying that the sky ain't blue
And boots weren't made for sitting by the door
Since you don't wanna stay anymore

[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
Guess I'll see you 'round again
I know my place, and it ain't with you
Well sunsets fade, and love does too
Yeah, we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, there ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space, cowboy

[Verse 2]
After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
And there ain't room for both of us in this town

[Chorus]
So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space

[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
Though we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space, cowboy
