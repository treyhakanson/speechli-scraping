[Intro: Khalid]
Na, na, na, na, ooh
Oh, no, oh, ayy

[Chorus: Khalid]
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be a-all day
I'll be a-all day
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day
I'll be all day

[Verse 1: Khalid]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This the type of shit that you been waiting all year for
Back in town for a minute if you with it (yeah)
Got a lot of time, I just need somewhere to spend it
I just press a button and the top go missing
I kept the slip so you know it's not rented, yeah, oh, oh
What you wanna do?
Worried 'bout your friends, they saw you this afternoon
I been reading your mind
No fair, but you gotta let me know
I'm all ears and I got a lot of room in my whip
If you wanna take it there, I'm on my way

[Chorus: Khalid]
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day
I'll be all day
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day
I'll be all day

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
(Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign)
Drop top the Porsche, put that bitch in sport
Out here in the field, oh yeah (yeah), I'm already here, yeah
Come outside, looking like a snack, hurry up, get in, hell yeah (yeah)
Come with me on this mission (ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
Riding down the coast (ooh yeah), I want that for sure (ooh yeah)
You say, "Play Khalid" (ooh yeah)
I say, "Pass the weed" (ooh yeah)
Pull up to the crib, oh, said you've never been before
Put you in Provocateur, girl, I made you mi amor
You said you left your ex, that dude was always gassin'
You said before me, you ain't never been this happy
You took an L with him and winning ever since (ever since)
You hit my phone, I'm on my way, I cancel plans, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day
I'll be all day
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day
I'll be all day

[Verse 3: 6LACK]
You tryna make a move
Tonight I got the time, tell me what you wanna do
Call the squad if you wanna rendezvous
They gon' push up on they own, I only got room for two
From the 'jects on the set, it's a Porsche, not a 'Vette
I confess, I'ma flex till they show some respect
Get away so we can make sense of your life
You was in park but I just put your shit in drive
Now coast like there's no tomorrow
Moving too fast, I'm open to drive slow (yeah)
I don't want you to wonder where I go
Can learn a lot from this and that's something that I know

[Chorus: Khalid]
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day
I'll be all day
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day
I'll be all day
