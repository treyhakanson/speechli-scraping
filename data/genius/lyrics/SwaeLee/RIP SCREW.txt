Title: RIP SCREW
Artist: Travis Scott

[Intro: Swae Lee, DJ Screw & Travis Scott]
(Ya know? Southside)
Rest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly
I'm gonna let you know the move
I'm gonna let you know the move
I'm gonna take you on a cruise
I'm gonna take you home and screw
(Southside)

[Verse 1: Swae Lee & DJ Screw]
And that's all I've been sayin' (Southside)
If you fall for the games then you're the one playin'
Because it's too much money out here
And there's too many honeys out here
Feel like I tripped off the drank, that's weird
Feel like I tripped off the drank, that's weird

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Rest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly
Oh my God, I just can feel the love
Droptop with the windows up
Jump inside, oh, won't you roll with us?
Make the devil bite the angel dust
Shawty got a thing for us
Shawty what you want
Tell me what you like
Tell me what you want

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Rest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly, yeah
I just took a four to the head like "man"
Drop the top on the slab like "man"
Off the top of the dome like "man"
Nothin' beatin' home like "man"
In the Screw tape zone like "man"
I go Pimp C on the phone like "man"
Flip say platinum, don't do chrome like "man"
Had the Southside fade, now let the braids hang
This shit S.U.C smooth like "man"
Rest in peace Screw like "man"

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Rest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly
Oh my God, I just can feel the love
Drop top with the windows up

[Outro: Travis Scott]
Screw found international sound becauseâ€”
Throughout the South, and it's new to, um...
Shawty got a thing for us
