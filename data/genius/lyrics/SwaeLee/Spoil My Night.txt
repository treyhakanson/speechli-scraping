Title: Spoil My Night
Artist: Post Malone

[Chorus: Post Malone & Swae Lee]
I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night?
Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night (My night)
Spoil my night, spoil my night

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
My necklace has a natural glow
She dancin' in the strobe
Let's fuckin' spoil my night (Spoil my night)
Spent so much cash, I lost her
My cup was too toxic
I took the robe off (Yeah)
I couldn't get her off me
Dropped plenty money on her thighs
There's plenty room in my ride
I've never been like a small fry
She took me in, that's on my life

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Post Malone]
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night (My night)
Spoil my night, spoil my night
I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night? (Spoil my night)
Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Yeah, when I walk up in a party, they all act like they know me
Then I spotted lil' mama through the wall of jabronis (Ooh)
Point her out so I can bag her if they just bring her to me (bring her to me)
I ain't even see the face, but she got beautiful boobies (Wow)
And she see those diamonds in my teeth (In my teeth)
I see her smilin' back at me (Back at me)
I think she rock with me like Jumanji (Jumanji)
It's about time, Postmate Plan B
Now she whippin' out her phone and I know (And I know)
Damn, how many videos you gon' post?
Everybody on the 'Gram gonna know
My girl at home now my line about to blow (Yeah)
I know what I'm doin' ain't right
But ain't no need to spoil my night, no need, no need

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Post Malone]
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night (My night)
Spoil my night, spoil my night
I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night? (Spoil my night)
Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time (Yeah)

[Outro: Swae Lee]
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night, spoil my night
