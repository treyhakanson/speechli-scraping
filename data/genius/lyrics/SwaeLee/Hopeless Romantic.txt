Title: Hopeless Romantic
Artist: Wiz Khalifa

[Intro: Swae Lee]
Young Chop on the beat
Ooh, oh, oh, oh
She's gonna get, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
My night runs into mornin', all the time
And through my phone I'm scrollin', bang my line
Off that drank it's hard to focus (focus)
Seems like I'm always chosen by romantics that are hopeless
We can make arrangements though
And if you down, down, who knows, uh
I might just do you like me love it, yeah
Or make you my numero uno

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
She don’t allow herself
To miss nobody else
I’ve had days where I was dolo
But I never caught a bad case of FOMO (don't miss out)
Don’t talk to me about your previous
You know I’m that times two
Penthouse jumpin’ from the front to back room
Girls goin’ wild, showin’ off new tattoos

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
My night runs into mornin', all the time
And through my phone I'm scrollin', bang my line
Off that drank it's hard to focus (focus)
Seems like I am always chosen by romantics that are hopeless
We can make arrangements though
And if you down, down, who knows, uh
I might just do you like we lovin', yeah
Or make you my numero uno

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
We get aggressive
You be undressin’
Makin' a mess and
Cleanin' it up when we done
I got a serious question
Do you like sex? If you thinkin’ yes
Then I’m tryna test you
Say young Khalifa the best
But I got money to get
I gotta hop on a jet
Probably don’t call, I'ma text
Hop in my car, it get wet
I’m gettin' all of my checks
I’m winnin' all of my bets
No, I ain’t lettin’ you down
Baby, I’m giving a hundred percent

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
My night runs into mornin', all the time
And through my phone I'm scrollin', bang my line
Off that drank it's hard to focus (focus)
Seems like I'm always chosen by romantics that are hopeless
We can make arrangements though
And if you down, down, who knows, uh
I might just do you like we lovin', yeah
Or make you my numero uno

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I can't keep my mind off you(of you)
I can't keep my mind off you(of you)
I can't keep my mind off you(of you)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
My night runs into mornin', all the time
And through my phone I'm scrollin', bang my line
Off that drank it's hard to focus (focus)
Seems like I’m always chosen by romantics that are hopeless
We can make arrangements though
And if you down, down, who knows, uh
I might just do you like we lovin', yeah
Or make you my numero uno
