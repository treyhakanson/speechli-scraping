Title: â€‹break up with your girlfriend, i'm bored
Artist: Ariana Grande

[Verse 1]
You got me some type of way (Hmm)
Ain't used to feelin' this way (Mmm-mmm)
I do not know what to say (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one fuckin' look at your face (Hmm)
Now I wanna know how you taste (Mmm-mmm)
Usually don't give it away (Yeah, yeah)
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (Mornin')
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (Care)
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored

[Verse 2]
This shit always happen to me (Yeah)
Why can't we just play for keeps? (Mmm-mmm)
Practically on my knees (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
You know what you're doin' to me
You're singin' my songs in the streets, yeah, yeah
Actin' all innocent, please
When I know you out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you realize she's right there (Yeah)
And you're at home like, "Damn, she can't compare"

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (In the mornin')
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (I don't care, yee)
Break up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored

[Post-Chorus]
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend
With your girlfriend
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend

[Bridge]
You could say I'm hatin' if you want to
But I only hate on her 'cause I want you
Say I'm trippin' if you feel like
But you without me ain't right (Ain't right)
You could call me crazy 'cause I want you
And I never even ever fuckin' met you
Say I'm trippin' and it ain't right
But you without me ain't nice (Ain't nice, yeah)

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (Hit in the mornin', yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (Care, yeah)
Break up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored

[Post-Chorus]
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, baby, girlfriend
With your girlfriend
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend
With your girlfriend
