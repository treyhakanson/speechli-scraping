[Intro]
Mmm, yeah, yuh

[Verse]
I thought you into my life (Whoa), look at my mind (Yuh)
No better place or a time, (Look) how they align
Universe must have my back, fell from the sky into my lap
And I know you know that you're my soulmate and all that
I’m like ooh, ooh, my whole life got me ready for you, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Got me happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy, yeah
I'ma be happy, happy
Won’t get no crying from me, yeah
Gonna be happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy, yeah
Gonna be happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy, yeah
Gonna be happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy
