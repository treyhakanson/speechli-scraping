(Yeah)\nInvite 'em in like a One A Day\nI'm not done (Preach!)\n'Cause I feel like the beast of burden\nThat line in the sand, was it even worth it?\n'Cause the way I see people turning's\nMakin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose\nI'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds\nAnd I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word\nHas the court of public opinion reached a verdict\nOr still yet to be determined?\n'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped\nBut if I could go back, I'd at least reword it\nAnd say I empathize with the people this evil serpent\nSold the dream to that he's deserted\nBut I think it's workin'\nThese verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous\nAnd he's too scurred to answer me with words\n'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered\nBut I know at least he's heard it\n'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service\nTo meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him\nOr ask if I'm linked to terrorists\nI said, \"Only when it comes to ink and lyricists.\"\nBut my beef is more media journalists\n(Hold up, hold up, hold up\u2026)\nI said my beef is more meaty, a journalist\nCan get a mouthful of flesh\nAnd yes, I mean eating a penis\n'Cause they been pannin' my album to death\nSo I been givin' the media fingers\nDon't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh\nBut they been puttin' me through the ringer\nSo I ain't ironin' shit out with the press\nBut I just took this beat to the cleaners\n\n"}
