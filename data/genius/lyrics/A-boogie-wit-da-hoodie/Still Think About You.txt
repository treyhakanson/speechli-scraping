Title: Still Think About You
Artist: A Boogie wit da Hoodie

[Intro]
Now I'm saying, "What's good with you"
I remember being in the hood with you
I still think about you

[Verse 1]
Fuck all the phony shit
Fuck it, I'm stuck on some doly shit
Had a knife in my back when I wrote this shit
I look back and I laugh when I noticed it
I shoot up and lean back on some Kobe shit
They don't know how to pass on some Kobe shit
Should've listened, my mom always told me this
I was only thirteen when she told me this
Watch who you fuck with
And never ever trust a nigga for nothing
Even if you feel like you really love her
Don't ever tell that bitch that you really love her
'Cause that's when she's gon' make you feel like you nothing
And that's when you gon' start to feel like you buggin'
I wish I would've never told you wassup
And I wish I never even told you pull up

[Chorus]
Got me saying, "What's good with you?"
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you

[Verse 2]
I hope that I never see you again
I don't wanna put up with it
I don't wanna fuck with it
I'ma just send you this letter whenever I'm done with it
I know you gon' read it
I called you a bitch at the end, I don't know if I mean it
I ain't wanna believe what my niggas was telling me
My nigga I shoulda cheated
And now I feel stupid
I shoulda knew better than this
Wasn't the right way to do it
I should've been choosing the money instead of a bitch
Fuck it cause I'm gettin' to it
Just watch how I do it
I knew I was ready for this
Bitch I'ma focus on music
You love how I do it
I knew I was ready for this

[Chorus]
Got me saying, "What's good with you?"
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you

[Verse 3]
But all I can say is you dumb ho, you got me feeling stupid
You got me singing all these love songs
What the fuck am I doing?
I don't know what I'm doing
But I'm going up though, I just hope I don’t lose it
Bitches pickin' and choosin'
But I know what's up tho, I already been through it
We coulda been balling together
Hit up the mall, it's whatever
You know that I started from nothing
Them bitches was fed up
The way you made all of them jealous
You said that you was gon' ride forever and ever
You told me forever and ever
I shoulda known you was lyin'
I shoulda known better
You lied I should’ve knew better

[Chorus]
But still I'm saying, "What's good with you?"
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you

[Outro]
Now I'm saying, "What's good with you?"
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think a-
I still think ab-
I still think about you yeah
I still think about you, you, you, you
Had a knife in my back when I wrote this shit
I look back and I dab when I noticed it
I look back and I dab when I noticed it
I look back and I dab when I noticed it
I look back and I laughed when I noticed it
I still think about you, you, you, you
I still think about you, you, you, you
(Now I'm saying, "What's good with you?")
I still think about you
I look back and I dab when I noticed it
