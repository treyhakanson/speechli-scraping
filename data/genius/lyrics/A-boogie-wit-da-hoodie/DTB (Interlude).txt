PART I: "D.T.B."
[Intro]
What the fuck I'm supposed to fall in love with you?
Bitch, I should've never even...

[Verse 1]
What the fuck I'm supposed to fall in love with you?
Bitch, I should've never even fucked with you
Trust issues, that shit made me feel uncomfortable
I should've never made you feel like I was stuck with you
You ever had somebody say that they was down for you?
They made it feel so real like they really down for you
They clown on you everytime they turn around on you
They not loyal, they happy they looking down on you
You really jacking you don't fuck with me
Now I feel like you never kept it a buck with me
You saying I ain't the daddy that would be luckily
I'm hoping that ain't my baby that shit gon' fuck with me
You had me looking like a clown, bitch
That other nigga gon' fuck up running his mouth, bitch
How I fuck him up and drown him in a fountain
Leave that lil nigga somewhere in the mountains
But now I'm like "What the fuck, nigga"
I love money I don't love bitches

[Chorus]
Fuck bitches, D.T.B, no I don't trust bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B, no I don't trust bitches
No kissing and even hugging
Cause I don't wanna fall in love with them
Fuck bitches, D.T.B, no I don't trust bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B, no i don't trust bitches

[Verse 2]
What the fuck im supposed to fall in love with you?
Bitch, I just wanted to fuck with you
Thought you was cool to kick it, probably get lunch with you
I never meant for shit to get so fucking comfortable
Yeah niggas told you they was down for you
But when you fucked up, nigga they not around for you
They say they with it to ride a hundred thou for you
They clown on you as soon as they turn around on you
I salute ya, you took my bitch and you scooped her
I'ma lose her, I feel like a fucking loser
Fuck the rumors cause I passed her back to ya
Ran through her then I passed her back to ya
Ha! But now I'm feeling like I'm, Ha!

[Chorus]
Fuck bitches, D.T.B, no I don't trust bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B, no i don't trust bitches
Love bitches, na
Now im like what the fuck nigga
I don't wanna fall in love with it
I love money I don't love bitches
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches, my nigga we don't fuck with ya
My nigga we don't fuck with ya
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches. fuck bitches, fuck bitches
My nigga we don't fuck with ya
My nigga we dont fuck with ya
Fuck bitches, D.T.B, no I don't trust bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B, no I don't trust bitches

PART II: "Interlude"
[Verse]
I love money I don't love bitches
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
My nigga we don’t fuck… wit ya
So why you fuck wit us?
I believed in you, should've told me you had a seed in you
This whole time you was frontin' and I ain't see it in you
Now I'm thinkin' what was you doin' when I ain't sleep with you
Now your tooth brush is my new Jordan cleaner
I know who the Ten is, you not Serena
You was supposed to be my dream girl, two-seater
For me and you in a Beemer
But now you showed me not to love bitches
Now you showed me not to trust bitches
Fuck bitches, just hit it, never run wit it
Hit the blunt
Forget about her when the blunt hit ya
Who did it? Bitch you did it
Really thought that i was losin' it, now I’m losin'
Ever since I been in school, they been pick and choosing
I don’t know how I go through wit it, I go through wit it
This is stupid
But who the fuck am I to judge bitches?
I guess I never knew how to love bitches
Fuck bitches. Fuck bitches, Fuck bitches
My nigga we don’t fuck… wit ya
So why you fuck wit us
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches
