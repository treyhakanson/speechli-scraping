Title: Not a Regular Person
Artist: A Boogie wit da Hoodie

[Intro]
(Ness on the beat)
I'm not a regular person

[Verse 1]
Done with the perkys
I don’t even feel like it's working
I was playing the bench, I was lurking
On the block where they plotting on murking
You don’t even know I was hurting
I was fucked up, a bitch had me hurting
And I think she did it on purpose
I can't fuck with the hate, I'm allergic
I feel like they had me on standby
See the pain in my damn eyes
I got out of jail and my mans died
I never sleep, I'm a vampire
I'm not a regular person
I can't be giving out verses
I'm making the industry nervous
I’m still working through all the disturbance
I'm done with these Balenciagas
They keep on fucking my socks up
Nothing but foreigns behind us
We used to pull up in the Honda
Now every time that we pop up
We got to pull up in designer
We doing it just to remind us
To never go back to the bottom
They started off hating on me
Everybody debating on me
A nigga wrote a statement on me
My life, they want to take it from me
So I got a .380 on me
It ain’t never on safety, I be
Having all of this paper on me
I just hope you praying for me
I can tell you what happened
The streets turned me into a savage
I started off juggin’ and trapping
Watch a couple a niggas get blasted
Way too much blood for a napkin
Won’t nobody tell you what happened
I’m good when you see me in traffic
Automatic in the Benz 4matic
In the S550 I’m speeding
Nigga you wouldn’t believe it
I came up from nothing I mean it
Now I’m living everything I was dreaming
I’m killing, I feel like I’m cheating
They kept on giving me reasons
Can’t nobody get in between us
Only us, I put that on everything

[Chorus]
Fuck it up, fuck it up now
My nigga it’s just us now
Every Rollie getting bust down
Young niggas repping uptown
I was down but I'm up now
Fuck around with them fuck 'rounds
Ain’t no pounds or “what’s ups” now
Pretty bitches hit me up now

[Verse 2]
I got on Saint Laurent, come here baby
I just wanted some company baby
I don’t want you to feel like I’m playing
Can I fuck you without you complaining?
Got no time for a lunch with you baby
I get bread, what the fuck is you saying?
I get fly on any different occasion
I be in and out of different locations
I can't stop, I put on for this
Swear to god I put on for this
Had to move out my mama's crib
Had to put in overtime for this
I can brag cause I’m confident
I’m the man, ain’t no stopping it
I don’t got to wait for a shopping list
I want to body a fit then I'm copping it

[Chorus]
I fuck it up, fuck it up now
Every Rollie getting bust down
Young niggas repping uptown
I was down but I'm up now
Ain’t no pounds or “what’s ups” now
My nigga it's just us now
I'm not a regular person, I'm not a regular person
I'm not a regular person, I'm not a regular person
I'm not a regular person
