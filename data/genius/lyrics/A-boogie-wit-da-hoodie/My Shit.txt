Title: My Shit
Artist: A Boogie wit da Hoodie

[Intro]
In my bag now, In my bag now
What the fuck is that sound?
What the fuck is that sound?

[Verse 1]
Brought the MAC out, niggas sat down
I got shit I never had now, I could brag now
Got my bitch a Louis bag now, she could brag now
Bought my bitch a Birkin bag now, she a brat now
Now I'm sittin' in the club in a different bag now
Baby when I pick it up you gon put that ass down
Tell 'em you don't give a fuck, baby spin that ass 'round
Tell the DJ turn it up, what the fuck is that sound?
A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie and it's always foreign
Yeah I know she like my style, them other niggas borin'
When I pull up it go skrrt skrrt, that's a foreign
When I pull up on a red light, they don't want it
Yeah I came up from the mud and my baby know that
Introduced her to my plug, now she think she all that
When I first hit her up, no she never wrote back
Then I saw her at the club so I got up on that

[Chorus]
Now every time they play this song she say "This is my shit"
See the flick of my wrist
And I know she know wassup, baby this is my shit
See the flick of my wrist

[Verse 2]
They know that's my bitch, that's a fact and she stuck with me
When you in my section, fill it up when my cup empty
I can't fuck with rats, that's a fact, that's a dub nigga
All about my F, can't put water over blood nigga
Trust me, it get ugly
If I wasn't gettin' money would you still want me?
If I told you I was broke would you start actin' funny?
This is all I ever wanted, you can't take it from me

[Chorus]
Now every time they play this song, she say "This is my shit"
See the flick of my wrist
And I know she know wassup baby this is my shit
See the flick of my wrist
