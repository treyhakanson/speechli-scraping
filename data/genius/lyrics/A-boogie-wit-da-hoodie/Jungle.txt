Title: Jungle
Artist: A Boogie wit da Hoodie

[Intro]
Nigga this is what that jungle do
You been plottin' nigga, wasn't you?
I should have never even fucked with you

[Verse 1]
Yeah I started in the back, had to skip the line though
I'ma keep that shit a stack 'til my fucking time go
Niggas throw you in the shade cause they wanna shine though
Nigga throw me in the grave in a Ferragamo
Man I can't believe they killed my fucking bro Quado
Shit was so deep I had to say that with my eyes closed
That shit made me wanna treat a nigga like he John Doe
Nine on me Rondo, now that nigga John Doe

[Bridge 1]
This is all I ever wanted nigga
Why would I let you take it from me nigga?
I ain't stupid, ain't no dummy nigga
A couple fingers on a couple triggers
Fuck with you, why would I fuck with you?
You been plottin', nigga wasn't you?
I should have been watching from the jump with you
Fuck it, this is what that jungle do

[Verse 2]
Started, what I started
Anybody want a problem, this is my shit
Tell em' if they want a problem I'm from Highbridge
Got a nigga with a shotgun up in my whip
Making bitches go retarded with this hard dick
Why you think my name is Artist? I'm an artist
I woke up to a m√©nage, I'm just being honest
I get money, if I want it, I'ma cop it
If a nigga want static let him have it
Have you ever seen a mini semi-automatic?
It go dumb like a drum, hear the beat blastin'
When it come to that fire, I'm a fucking dragon

[Chorus]
Nigga this is what that jungle do
Nigga this is what that jungle do
You been plottin' nigga wasn't you?
I should have never even fuck with you

[Verse 3]
I was walking in the rain with my Timbs on
Stepping over puddles full of pain, it's a big storm
13 on my Balmains, it's a big storm
In the club love to make it rain
Like what nigga, we don't fuck witcha
Know I'm all about my bucks nigga, I don't trust niggas
Ever since I was a young nigga coming up nigga
Ain't nobody show me love nigga, so it's fuck niggas
It's just us nigga

[Bridge 2]
Nigga this is what that jungle do
Nigga this is what that jungle do
That jungle turned me into a monster
That jungle made me go harder
That jungle turned me to a monster
That jungle made me go harder
That jungle turned me to a monster
That jungle made me go harder
That jungle turned me to a monster
That jungle made me go harder

[Chorus]
The jungle turned me to a monster
The jungle made me go harder
Jungle turned me to a monster
Nigga this is what that jungle do
Nigga this is what the jungle do
Been plottin' nigga, wasn't you?
Should have never even fucked with you
