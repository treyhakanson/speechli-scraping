Title: â€‹my boy
Artist: Billie Eilish

[Verse 1]
My boy's being sus he was shady enough but now he's just a shadow
My boy loves his friends like I love my split ends and by that I mean
He cuts 'em off
(What?!)

[Chorus]
My boy
My boy
My boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy
My boy
My boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Verse 2]
My boy's being sus and he don't know how to cuss, he just sounds like he's tryna be his father (Who are you?)
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar and by that I mean he said he'd "change"

[Chorus]
My boy
My boy
My boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy
My boy
My boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
My boy, my boy, my friends, I love my split ends
(Alright dude, go trip over a knife)

[Chorus]
My boy
My boy
My boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy
My boy
My boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Verse 3]
You want me to be yours well then you gotta be mine, and if you want a good girl, then goodbye
You want me to be yours well then you gotta be mine, and if you want a good girl, then goodbye
