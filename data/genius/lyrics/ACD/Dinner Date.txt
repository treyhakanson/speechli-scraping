Title: Dinner Date
Artist: A.C.D.

[INTRO:]
OH aii
Eh aii
It's ACD

[VERSE 1:]
I was feeling lonely on a Sunny evening
Mama saw me She said what is happening
I've been looking for the one but I never found the one
Mama told me Oh My Son you gonna find the one
So I headed to the bar just to grab a couple drinks
Looked to my left I saw this pretty chick
She was sitting all alone
Guess She came on Her own
So I took out my phone, I went to Her and I said;
Hey, Hi how you doing? she looked at me and she said oh my
I'm like where are you from and whats your name
And then she turn and She say boy bye

[HOOK:]
Let's go on a dinner date
Listen to the things that I gotta say
I'm for real see I don't play
Let's go on a dinner date Ooh (x2)

This song talks about a single good guy searching for love but haven never found one
His Mom assured him that he was eventually gonna find love
He met a lady which He liked at the bar
The lady seemed to like him too but was still proving to be tough
So He asked Her out on a Dinner Date
Asking Her to listen to the things He has got to say and that He's for real and not to play games
