Title: Street Life
Artist: Mobb Deep

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
M-O-B-B D-E-E-P, A.C.D. burn somethin'
Let's get lifted, Queens is you with me?
Niggas' shifty, I turned around, a kid tried to hit me
I back him down with the 50-50
It had to been the thug in me
The Tunnel banging come and get me
The first five hundred bitches free
The kid with the God-U will let all my gods come through
Live niggas on this side of the bar, you get smacked, boo
And fucked too, shit on me? Well then, fuck you
Gone with your high class ass if you want to
Outta state you be suckin' me off and breakin' off
Weave bitch thinks she's stallion but my dick went soft
My Mobb got in lock with Masterlock
You get your locks picked
Run up in your spot, mask and glove shit
Queens niggas involved with thug shit, you get lumped'd
Quick, we in the bathroom thumpin'

[Verse 2: Ammo]
To the three-time losers, alcohol abusers
Big money spenders and the Ebineezer Scroogers
Thugs holdin' fort with the sixteen shot Rugers
The CREAM that I redeem will bring a Lex and Landcruiser
Dominant chapter, assassin'in the obsolete
And my Mobb comes Deep to put the wind beneath your feet
My heart's harder than concrete, and nervous streets
Be walked offbeat, but still thugs carry heats
I get deeper than skin, paragraphs from within
Dear lord, my life is trife, please forgive for me sins
My kin stay my kin, ain't no room for extra friends
One love to my thugs up north in the pens
Be a prophet to raise, beat my speech on stage
Lyricist renegade, breakin' down barricades
These days are gettin' rough, another brother handcuffed
Fallen victim to the game it's like style's corrupt

[Hook: Prodigy]
My crime niggas live the (Street life)
Them Queens niggas livin' (Street life)
My drug niggas livin' (Street life)
My street niggas livin' (Street life)
We thug niggas livin' (Street life)
N.Y.C. livin' (Street life)
My Mobb niggas livin' (Street life)
What?

[Verse 3: Havoc]
For every rhyme I write, reality bites
My clique keeps shit virgin tight
Regulate and know the rule
I gets some insight plus info, doin' stickups with my kickos
My .44 will burn that ass like going raw with nymphos
So protect your lifestyle, rock your vest
Or get your Teflon put to the motherfuckin' test
State pen put on points, son you know
Stay on the low, got the back, or no-no
When I'm on the dolo, got the God-U-Now
Kid, you wanna get foul, so now I gotta put that ass back on profile
Change your character, you ain't got stamina
Nigga get that dough, I ain't mad at'cha
The Infamous handle business, gonna make mines
Forever, son, kid you heard it through the grapevine

[Verse 4: A-Dog]
To my royal thug committees and outlaws that live the life of Frank Nitty
The big city mobster, the ? has made the
God unholy, skies forever watch me
The prophecy, another chapter, there's no stoppin' me
Crime Addiction, my life story is far from fiction
Because at one time, the .44 bullets took the world, bring sparks and friction
I anaylse this Earth, so I roll with trife characters
The hardest for the world to cap, and shining like a
Full carat diamond with perfect design
Philly's and 9 mili's and Coupe Bentley's forever reclinin'
To the shoot, physicals in this paradox
The world is hot and my plot is to receive grands and yachts
Until then I be a trife individual, dwellin' in these days
Scorchin' from the D's plus the sun's rays
Dead President dreams and million dollar schemes
Killer Queens, the land of CREAM fiends
A.C.D. the world terrorist
Stainless Rugers for the intruders and my cipher's Infamous
Through New York and worldwide, we penetrate your inside
*?Diamond did?* drama, son, and 9 clips so prepare for heaven's ride

[Hook: Prodigy]
A.C.D. livin' (Street life)
My ice niggas livin' (Street life)
Them jewel rockin' niggas livin' (Street life)
Them crack niggas livin' (Street life)
Them coke-sellin' niggas livin' (Street life)
Word, N.Y.C. livin' (Street life)
My man L.E.S. livin' (Street life)
The whole Queensbridge livin' (Street life)
Word up son, we're livin' (Street life)

[Outro: Prodigy (Havoc)]
KnowI'msayin? Word up, A.C.D., Mobb Deep in the motherfuckin'....
Yo yo, uh
Hold me down son (No doubt son)
Back 'em down son (I got'cha back son)
