Title: No Broken Hearts
Artist: Bebe Rexha

[Intro: Bebe Rexha + Nicki Minaj]
Oh baby, oh baby, I know that you've been hurtin'
(This is a star-studded collaboration)
Oh baby, oh baby, I know that you've been hurtin'
I'm Nicki Minaj, that's Bebe, let's go

[Hook: Bebe Rexha]
No broken hearts in the club, no tears in the club
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks – pour it up!
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight

[Verse 1: Bebe Rexha]
We goin' straight to Miami
Hop on a plane, don't need no plans
Shinin' so hard like a Grammy
Forget all the players what they did
We gon' be buyin' the drinks, we gon' be buyin' the drinks
Line up the bottles, line up the models, we gon' forget everything

[Pre-Hook: Bebe Rexha]
Oh, ai-ain't nobody goin' home, you-you know what you came for
To dance off the pain, don't feel a thing, just feel the champagne
If you're feelin' lonely, better let me hear you sing

[Hook: Bebe Rexha]
No broken hearts in the club, no tears in the club
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks – pour it up!
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
We only got one life, so let's go hard 'til the day we die
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks – pour it up!
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha]
We gonna do it real biggie
Sky is the limit in this town
We takin' over the city
We too high to bring us down
We gonna do what we do, we gonna do what we do
Three in the mornin', four in the mornin', meet you for eggs in the mornin'

[Pre-Hook: Bebe Rexha]
Oh, ai-ain't nobody goin' home, you-you know what you came for
To dance off the pain, don't feel no shame, just feel the champagne
If you're feelin' lonely, better let me hear you sing

[Hook: Bebe Rexha]
No broken hearts in the club, no tears in the club
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks – pour it up!
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
We only got one life, so let's go hard 'til the day we die
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks – pour it up!
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, ay yo, Bebe, anybody hatin' need a pee-pee
Sip a little Myx, pop pills 'til I'm sleepy
I'm the one that bust it open out in Waikiki
Pull up in the Ghost, I'm creepy
They don't want beef, we proved it
Niggas better keep it on wax like a Q-tip
Keep his dick wetter than the cruise ship
Flower than a tulip, flyer than your new bitch
I do's it, yep, I'm up two zip
Girls is my sons, I'm givin' them milf teas
They be sweatin' me, headbands and gym tees
Like bad knees on Dirk Nowitzki's
It is going down like M. Lewinsky's
Wrist freeze, yep, my wrist on pink skis
Ring finger be shittin' on my pinky's
Make 'em mad, aw, man, I got 'em hatin' bad
Bloodclaat, money green like Jamaican flags

[Hook: Bebe Rexha]
No broken hearts in the club, no tears in the club
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks – pour it up!
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
We only got one life, so let's go hard 'til the day we die
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks – pour it up!
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
