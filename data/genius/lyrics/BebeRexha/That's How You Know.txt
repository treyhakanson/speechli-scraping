Title: That's How You Know
Artist: Nico & Vinz

[Verse 1: Nico]
You were big city living, girlfriend like Eva Mendes
Until your side chick called you up
Saying she might be pregnant
Now you're alone and crying
Inside, you're slowly dying
Cause Magic Mike just got your key

[Chorus: Nico & Vinz]
That's how you know you fucked up
That's how you know you fucked up
That's how you know you fucked up
That's how you know you fucked up

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha]
Bebe
You were the man in college, got a degree in awesome
And had more zeroes in your bank than all the Matrix coding
Now you're in your mama's basement
Cause you spent every paycheck
The IRS your new best friend

[Chorus: Nico & Vinz & Bebe Rexha]
That's how you know you fucked up
That's how you know you fucked up
That's how you know you fucked up
That's how you know you fucked up

[Verse 3: Vinz]
Ha, oh
You had it going for you, moved out to California
Got lost in money, drugs, and women, out for all your dollars
Now Nico's unemployed and
Vinz's love for coke destroyed him
So now we back in Norway

[Chorus: Nico & Vinz]
That's how we know we fucked up
That's how we know we fucked up (oh no!)
That's how we know we fucked up (hey)
That's how we know we fucked up
Fucked up, fucked up

[Verse 4: Kid Ink]
Uh, yeah, Kid Ink
You used to be the big spender
Grabbing the check every dinner
Showing out to your girlfriend's best friends
Just so they could wish they was with you (wait)
You ain't wanna hit the club, but the pressure
Got you out trying to get a table and a picture
Everybody Snapchat pictures
But ain't nobody trying to drive on the liquor, nah nah
I been getting so twisted, tie-dye, bye-bye
Think we should leave after I pay
But you forgot to save cash for the valet, wait, nah nah

[Chorus: Nico, Vinz, & Bebe Rexha]
That's how you know you fucked up
That's how you know
That's how you know you fucked up
That's how you know you fucked up
That's how you know
That's how you know you fucked up
That's how you know, that's how you know you messed up
That's how you know you fucked up
That's how you know you fucked up, you fucked up
That's how you know you fucked up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's how you know you fucked up, you fucked up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
