Title: Stupify
Artist: Disturbed

[Intro]
Yeah
Bringing you another disturbing creation
From the mind of one sick animal
Who can't tell the difference
And gets stupefied

[Verse 1]
I've been waiting my whole life for just one fuck
And all I needed was just one fuck
How can you say that you don't give a fuck?
I find myself stupefied, coming back again

All I wanted was just one fuck
One tiny, little, innocent fuck
And when I feel like I'm shit out of luck
I find myself stupefied, coming back again

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do you not like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping
I think I'm breaking down

Why do you not like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping away

[Chorus]
See, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupefied! "It's all the same", you say

Live with it, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupefied! I get stupefied!

[Verse 2]
All the people in the left wing, rock
And all the people in the right wing, rock
And all the people in the underground, rock
I find myself stupefied, coming back again

All the people in the high-rise, rock
And all the people in the projects, rock
And all "La Gente" in the barrio, rock
I find myself stupefied, coming back again

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do you not like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping
I think I'm breaking down

Why do you not like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping away

[Chorus]
See, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupefied! "It's all the same", you say

Live with it, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupefied! I get stupefied!

[Interlude]
Tefached...
Tefached...

[Bridge]
And don't deny me
No, baby now, don't deny me
And darling, don't be afraid

[Chorus]
But I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupefied!

[Outro]
Look in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!
Look in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!
Look in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!
Look in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!

Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face, step in my soul

Look in my face! (Step in my soul)
Look in my face! (Step in my soul)
Look in my face! (Step in my soul)
I begin to stupify!
