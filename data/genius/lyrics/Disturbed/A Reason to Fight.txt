Title: A Reason to Fight
Artist: Disturbed

[Verse 1]
The image in your eyes
Reflecting the pain that has taken you
I hear it in your voice, so ridden with shame
From what's ailing you

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't give up, so don't give in
You've fallen down, but you can rise again
So don't give up

[Chorus]
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

[Verse 2]
Lost in your world of lies
I find it so hard to believe in you
Can it be real this time
Or just a part of this game that we're playing through?

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't give up, so don't give in
You've fallen down, but you will rise again
I won't give up

[Chorus]
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

[Bridge]
Don't let it take your soul
Look at me, take control
We're going to fight this war
This is nothing worth dying for

[Interlude]
Are you ready to begin?
This is a battle that we are gonna win

[Chorus]
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

[Outro]
I'll be your reason to fight
Give you a reason to fight
