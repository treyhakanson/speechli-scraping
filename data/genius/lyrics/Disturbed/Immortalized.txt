Title: Immortalized
Artist: Disturbed

[Verse 1]
This is wartime, this is our time
We won't be denied
Feed the fire that is raging inside
This is go time, this is show time
We will fight ‘til their wills are broken
This is game time, an insane time
Let the madness fly
Show them strength that just can’t be defied
Find the power to devour
Let the beast inside now be woken

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In this world only the strong will survive
Hear the roar and you will know you’re alive
Feel the energy build in your soul ‘cause it’s time

[Chorus]
Oh, in the calm before the storm
Another legend will be born
Another battle will be won
We will rise
Oh, so heed the call of confrontation
Today we feed on domination
Secure a legacy that will never die
Be immortalized

[Verse 2]
Raw emotion, pure devotion
They will testify
And our memory will endure for all time
Never hiding, no dividing
Let them witness us move as one now
Show no mercy, let the world see
We're invincible
Show them nothing is beyond our control
Take it higher, our desire
Will determine what we’ve become now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Are you ready for the test of your life?
See the fear bleeding right through their eyes
Feel the energy build in your soul ‘cause it’s time

[Chorus]
Oh, in the calm before the storm
Another legend will be born
Another battle will be won
We will rise
Oh, so heed the call of confrontation
Today we feed on domination
Secure a legacy that will never die
Be immortalized

[Bridge]
Feel it, take no prisoners now
Take it, there it is standing in front of us
Hear it, our deliverance now
Own it, give 'em an image of us that will
Last for all time

[Chorus]
Oh, in the calm before the storm
Another legend will be born
Another battle will be won
We will rise
Oh, so heed the call of confrontation
Today we feed on domination
Secure a legacy that will never die
Be immortalized
