Title: Applause
Artist: Lady Gaga

[Verse 1]
I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, "is it right or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an IV
Baby, could I bear being away from you
I found the vein, put it in here

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

[Chorus]
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (make it real loud)

[Post-Chorus]
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

[Verse 2]
I've overheard your theory "Nostalgia's for geeks"
I guess sir, if you say so
Some of us just like to read
One second I'm a kunst, then suddenly the kunst is me
Pop culture was in art, now artâ€™s in pop culture, in me

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

[Chorus]
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (make it real loud)

[Post-Chorus]
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

[Bridge]
Woo...
Touch, touch
Woo...
Touch, touch, now...
Woo-oh-oh-oh...

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

[Chorus]
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (make it real loud)

[Post-Chorus]
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

[Outro]
A-R-T-P-O-P
