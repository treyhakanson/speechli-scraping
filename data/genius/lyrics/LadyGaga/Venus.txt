I can’t help the way I’m feeling
Goddess of love, please take me to your leader
I can’t help, I keep on dancing
Goddess of Love! Goddess of Love!

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Take me to your planet (to the planet)
Take me to your planet (to the planet)

Your leader, your leader (to the planet)
Take me to your planet (to the planet)
Take me to my planet (to the planet)
Take me to your Venus (to the planet)
Your Venus, Your Venus

[Chorus]
When you touch me, I die
Just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love
This could be love
Cause you’re out of this world
Galaxy, space, and time
I wonder if this could be love
(Venus)

Have an oyster, baby

Worship to the land
A girl from the planet (to the planet)
To the planet

I can’t help the way I’m feeling
Goddess of love, please take me to your leader
I can’t help, I keep on dancing
Goddess of Love! Goddess of Love!

Take me to your planet (to the planet)
Take me to your planet (to the planet)
Take me to your leader (to the planet)

Take me to your planet (to the planet)
Take me to my planet (to the planet)
Take me to your Venus (to the planet)
Your Venus, Your Venus

[Chorus]
When you touch me, I die
Just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love
This could be love
Cause you’re out of this world
Galaxy, space, and time
I wonder if this could be love

Just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love
This could be love
Cause you’re out of this world
Galaxy, space, and time
I wonder if this could be love

Wonder if this could be love
This could be love
Goddess of love
Wonder if this could be love
