Title: Love Me Tender
Artist: Elvis Presley

[Verse 1]
Love me tender
Love me sweet
Never let me go
You have made my life complete
And I love you so

[Verse 2]
Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfilled
For my darling I love you
And I always will

[Verse 3]
Love me tender
Love me long
Take me to your heart
For it's there that I belong
And we'll never part

[Verse 4]
Love me tender
Love me dear
Tell me you are mine
I'll be yours through all the years
Till the end of time

[Verse 5]
(When at last my dreams come true
Darling this I know
Happiness will follow you
Everywhere you go)
