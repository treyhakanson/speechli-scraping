Title: Hound Dog
Artist: Elvis Presley

[Verse 1]
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

[Verse 2]
When they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
When they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
You ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

Ahhhhhhhhhh (ahhhh)
Ahhhhhhhhhh (ahhhh)

[Verse 2]
When they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
When they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
You ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

[Verse 1]
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
