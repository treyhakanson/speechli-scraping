Title: Heartbreak Hotel
Artist: Elvis Presley

[Verse 1]
Well, since my baby left me
Well, I found a new place to dwell
Well, it's down at the end of lonely street
At Heartbreak Hotel

[Chorus]
You make me so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

[Verse 2]
Although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry away their gloom
And be so

[Chorus]
You make me so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

[Verse 3]
Now the bell hops tears keep flowing
The desk clerks dressed in black
Well they've been so long on lonely street
They'll never look back

[Chorus]
You make me so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

[Verse 4]
Hey now, if your baby leaves you
And you got a tale to tell
Just take a walk down lonely street
To Heartbreak Hotel
