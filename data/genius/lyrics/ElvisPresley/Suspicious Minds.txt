Title: Suspicious Minds
Artist: Elvis Presley

[Verse 1]
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

[Chorus]
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

[Verse 2]
So, if an old friend I know
Stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?

Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see the tears are real, I'm crying
(Yes, I'm crying)

[Chorus]
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

[Bridge]
Oh let our love survive
I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
When honey, you know I've never lied to you
Mmm yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

[Outro]
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby...
