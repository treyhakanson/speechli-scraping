Title: Unchained Melody
Artist: Elvis Presley

[Verse 1]
Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch, a long lonely time
And time goes by, so slowly and time can do so much
Are you, still mine?
I need your love, I need your love
Godspeed your love to me

[Verse 2]
Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the waiting arms of the sea
Lonely rivers cry, wait for me, wait for me
To the open arms, wait for me

[Verse 3]
My love, my darling, I've hungered for your kiss
Are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love
Godspeed your love, to me
