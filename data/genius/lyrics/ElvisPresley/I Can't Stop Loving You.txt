Title: I Can't Stop Loving You
Artist: Elvis Presley

[Verse 1]
I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind
To live in memory
Of such an old lonesome time

[Verse 2]
I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday

[Verse 3]
Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago
They still make me blue

[Verse 4]
They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart
