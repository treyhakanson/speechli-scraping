Title: Somebody
Artist: The Chainsmokers & Drew Love

[Chorus: Drew Love]
In the town full of fancy cars and
Crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need 'em now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna please somebody, somebody

[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
You should've known better
Than to listen to your heart again
People change with the weather
(Don't know, just know what I like)
I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody else
You put it back together
Don't let it fall apart again
People change with the weather

[Chorus: Drew Love]
In the town full of fancy cars and
Crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need 'em now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna please somebody, somebody

[Post-Chorus: Drew Love & Andrew Taggart]
Somebody
Somebody
(Don't know, just know what I like)
Somebody

[Verse 2: Andrew Taggart]
In my head, I knew better (In my head, I knew better)
I won't blame it on my faults again
I know I should forget her
(Don't know, just know what I like)
I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody

[Chorus: Drew Love, Both]
In the town full of fancy cars and
Crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need 'em now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna please somebody, somebody

[Post-Chorus: Drew Love & Andrew Taggart]
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
(Don't know, just know what I like)
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
(Don't know, just know what I like)

[Bridge: Andrew Taggart]
'Cause I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody
'Cause I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody

[Chorus: Drew Love, Both]
In the town full of fancy cars and
Crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need 'em now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna please somebody, somebody

[Post-Chorus: Drew Love & Andrew Taggart]
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
(Don't know, just know what I like)
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
(Don't know, just know what I like)

[Outro: Drew Love]
Lose myself tryna please somebody
Lose myself tryna please somebody
