Title: OMG
Artist: Camila Cabello

[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
Baby, what'cha say?
I ain't here to, I ain't here to conversate
Baby, I don't play
From Miami, causin' trouble in LA
Rowdy, Tennessee
If I don't send for you, best not come for me
Jordan, twenty-three
Guarantee you're gonna wanna leave with me

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I got that li-li-li-like

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo
You cannot believe it when we come through
Woo, my God, you look good today
Woo, my God, you look good today, yeah
Back up, back up, back up, do it slow-mo'
When she drop, it bounce back like a yo-yo
Woo, my God, you look good today
You look good today, yeah
Oh my God

[Post-Chorus: Quavo & Camila Cabello]
Oh my God, yeah (uh)
Oh my God, you're awesome (oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah (uh)
Oh my God, you're awesome (oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah (uh)
Oh my God, you're awesome (oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
Ice cold like my drink
Lose your concentration when you take a sip, yeah (sip it, sip it)
Cyclone, make it spin
'Cause all I, all I, all I, all I do is win

[Bridge: Camila Cabello]
Yeah, I'm cut like a diamond, I'm cold
4 A.M., bloom like a rose
Girls like the summer, we're gold, uh

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
We got that li-li-li-like

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo
You cannot believe it when we come through (yeah, yeah)
Woo, my God, you look good today
Woo, my God, you look good today, yeah
Back up, back up, back up, do it slow-mo'
When she drop, it bounce back like a yo-yo
Woo, my God (my God), you look good today
You look good today, yeah
Oh my God

[Post-Chorus: Quavo & Camila Cabello]
Oh my God, yeah (uh)
Oh my God, you're awesome (oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah (uh)
Oh my God, you're awesome (oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah (uh)
Oh my God, you're awesome (oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah

[Verse 3: Quavo & Camila Cabello]
Oh my God, she's so right, though (you know you're so right)
Me and you, that's a iso
Waist so small, look like lipo (li-lipo)
Moonwalk, my diamonds Michael (Mi-Michael)
She's so fine, I call my best man (brr)
Ain't no rings on her left hand (no rings)
I had a dream I was in quicksand (dream)
Then I woke up with the best plans (yeah)
Oh my God, yeah (uh)
Oh my God, you're awesome (yeah)
Smoke more green than Boston (green)
I make a play and call 'em (yeah)
Oh my God, she flossin' (ooh)
On the cover of magazines
I'mma crown the queen (queen)
Bad and boujee, thick and pretty
I'm givin' her wet dreams (ooh, yeah)
I'm the main reason why her friends like me (hey)
Havin' her mad at me, tackle me like I'm an athlete (ooh, yeah)

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo
You cannot believe it when we come through
Woo, my God, you look good today
Woo, my God, you look good today, yeah
Back up, back up, back up, do it slow-mo'
When she drop, it bounce back like a yo-yo
Woo, my God, you look good today
You look good today, yeah
Oh my God
