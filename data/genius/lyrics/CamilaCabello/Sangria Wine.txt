Title: Sangria Wine
Artist: Pharrell Williams & Camila Cabello

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Honey said she want somebody break her off proper (mhm)
Man, she so relentless so nothing can stop her (woo)
Never left the city (come on, man) but she swear she's a yardie (hey girl)
Because it's so awesome how she move her body (ow)
She do the sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Moving side to side (woo), front and behind (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), do the sangria wine (uh-huh)

[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
Move it, I move it
Move my body like it is a pipe
Tutti Frutti, is all that I got
Counter-clockwise, I'm mixin' it up (mixin' it up)
Sip it, sip it, I'll bet that you blush

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Yo sé, yo sé, yo sé, yo sé que tú quieres mi cuerpo, eh
Y quieres controlar mi mente, eh
Y todo el mundo quiere ser dueño de ella
Pero nadie puede, ¡ay!

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams with Camila Cabello]
Honey said she want somebody break her off proper
Man, she so relentless so nothing can stop her (woo)
Never left the city (come on, man) but she swear she's a yardie (yeah!)
Because it's so awesome how she move her body
She do the sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Moving side to side (woo), front and behind (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), do the sangria wine, yeah (uh-huh)

[Bridge: Camila Cabello]
(Uno) Wait a minute
(Dos) Wait a second
(Tres) ¿Qué, qué?
Turbo sauce (woo!)

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
Let's float around like the fruit at the top (huh)
In Miami, where winters are hot

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Yo sé, yo sé, yo sé, yo sé que tú quieres mi cuerpo, eh
Y quieres controlar mi mente, eh
Y todo el mundo quiere ser dueño de ella
Pero nadie puede, ¡ay! (noo)

[Chorus: Camila Cabello, Pharrell Williams & Both]
Honey said she want somebody break her off proper
Man, she so relentless so nothing can stop her
Never left the city (come on, man) but she swear she's a yardie (hey darling)
'Cause it's so awesome how I move my body
She do the sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Moving side to side (woo),  front and behind (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), do the sangria wine, yeah (uh-huh)

[Outro]
¿Qué, qué?
