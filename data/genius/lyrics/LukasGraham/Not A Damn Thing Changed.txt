Title: Not A Damn Thing Changed
Artist: Lukas Graham

[Verse 1]
Not a damn thing changed
All the boys that grew up back to back still do the same things
Now they're rewarding our records
But we still do the same things
I'm just spittin' words out my mouth
I made it, I still don't know how
Damn it, my stage show can light up the clouds
Now I'm gonna blow it until I go out
Bring it
Not a damn thing changed
Just the funerals that follow death and some more pain
We're drinking beers and we're lighting up joints in the cold rain
I'm glad I got somewhere to go
I know a few souls without hope
Brother, you know you can call if you're broke
Damn it, I pray you won't reach for that rope

[Chorus]
So pour out a shot for me
Keep pouring out the bottle for the real ones I lost
Who can no longer walk with me
For the ones still right here, yeah, for the ones who still care
Yeah, we still feel the same way
Just pushing in the same lane
Tryna sit still, keep looking at the main aim
Always doing me so I have to maintain
Not a damn thing changed, just sticking to the game plan

[Verse 2]
Not a damn thing changed
Got my team from day one, there's not one I could replace
Staying true to the way I grew up, how we were raised
My boys, they go in and go out
I'm just spittin' words out my mouth
So far away but I still make them proud
Damn it, I hope we all make it somehow
Bring it
Not a damn thing changed
I'm just tryna put feelings into words on this damn page
Some of my friends started leaving this life 'cause they couldn't wait
They know how it feels without hope
I'm glad I got somewhere to go
Stick to my people, that's people I know
They feel the same, we all follow that code

[Chorus]
Now pour out a shot for me
Keep pouring out the bottle for the real ones I lost
Who can no longer walk with me
For the ones still right here, yeah, for the ones who still care
Yeah, we still feel the same way
Just pushing in the same lane
Tryna sit still, keep looking at the main aim
Always doing me so I have to maintain
Not a damn thing changed, just sticking to the game plan

[Verse 3]
Not a damn thing changed
Won't forget where I'm from but for me there's just one way
It's a habit of beating the goals that we once made
I got a few records to break
I know we all got what it takes
The team is the team, same as back in the day
The team is the team, same as back in the day
Not a damn thing changed
If I wanted to turn back, it's already too late
Yeah, we just grew up too quick 'cause we
'Cause we couldn't wait
Pushing in the same lane
Tryna sit still, keep looking at the main aim
Always doing me so I have to maintain
Not a damn thing changed, just sticking to the game plan
