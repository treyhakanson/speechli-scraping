Title: Take the World By Storm
Artist: Lukas Graham

[Verse 1]
I've always dreamt of travel
Why should we die where we were born? (born)
Some road are laid with gravel
Sometimes you gotta build your own (own)

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna tear down boundaries
I wanna greet my enemies
I wanna see what I haven't seen
Cause I know there's more

[Chorus]
I take the world by storm (storm, storm, storm)
I take the world by storm (storm, storm, storm)

[Verse 2]
I don't have any answers
The more know the more I grow (grow)
I don't know where I'm going
But I'mma search cause I see hope (hope)

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna tear down boundaries
I wanna greet my enemies
I wanna see what I haven't seen
Cause i know there's more

[Chorus]
I take the world by storm (storm, storm, storm)
I take the world by storm (storm, storm, storm)

[Verse 3]
There's got to be more than this
Gotta figure out how to jump the wall
I wanna live and learn
Don't matter if I land or if I fall
I know I might return
At least I know I'll be walking tall
I'm not afraid
Cause I take the world by storm (storm, storm, storm)
I take the world by storm (storm, storm, storm)
