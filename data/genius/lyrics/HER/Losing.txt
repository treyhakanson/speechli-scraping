Title: Losing
Artist: H.E.R.

[Verse 1]
My ambition is attractive
My aggression isn't passive
I promise with you
The butterflies in my stomach are active
They're dancin', I'm feelin' static
Wanna get closer like magnets
Your company, I've been feinin'
I think I've turned to an addict
I don't get high
But lookin' in your eyes, I'm lifted
Can we make this tradition?
Your kisses make all my doubts go away
Go away, yeah

[Chorus]
You only show me love
When it comes to the music
It's like when I feel lonely
That's when you start actin' choosey
I don't wanna keep playin' them games
'Cause I feel like I'm losin'
I don't wanna keep playin' them games
'Cause I feel like I'm losin'
What we doin'?
What we doin'?
What we doin'?
What we doin'?
Let me know
Let me know
What we doin'?

[Verse 2]
Been on my grind
I know that my schedule is busy
But I always make sure I call you
When I touch down in your city
I'll make time because you're worth it
Fall back when you don't deserve it
And I'll start losin' patience
When my effort's bein' wasted
I've been tryna ride
Can't you see I'm on your side?
But it's killin' me
Tryna make sure that both of us survive
And love, I haven't got enough practice
All the ones before you were just a mistake
Or just a distraction
So tell me what's happenin'

[Chorus]
You only show me love
When it comes to the music
It's like when I feel lonely
That's when you start actin' choosey
I don't wanna keep playin' them games
'Cause I feel like I'm losin'
I don't wanna keep playin' them games
'Cause I feel like I'm losin'
What we doin'?
What we doin'?
What we doin'?
What we doin'?
Let me know
Let me know
What we doin'?

[Interlude]
What we doin'?
What we doin'?
What we doin'?
What we doin'?

[Outro]
Now I'll leave it up to you
Do what you gotta do
Like the watch I just got for you
I'll give you some time
I ain't gonna wait
I ain't gonna wait
For you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you
What are we doin'? What are we doin'?
What are we doin'? What are we doin'?
What are we doin'? What are we doin'?
Tell me, what are we doin'?
