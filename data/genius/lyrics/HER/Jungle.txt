[Hook: Gabriel Garz贸n Montano]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

[Verse 1: H.E.R.]
These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
Listen, you can hear them calling my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one in the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Forget what they talkin' about on your timeline, yeah
Cause that's cuttin' all into my time with you
My time with you, my

Rock me real slowly

I'm just like a baby, drooling over you

[Verse 2: H.E.R.]
He said you're my everything
I love you through everything, I done did everything to him
He forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treat it like it's a whatever thing
Trust me, boy, this shit is everything to me
He from the jungle, he from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this here is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?

[Verse 3: Drake]
These days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do
After we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?

[Outro: Gabriel Garz贸n Montano]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
Rock, rock
