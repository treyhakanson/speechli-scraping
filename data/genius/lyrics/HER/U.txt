[Verse 1]
Right now my head is a mess
Thinking 'bout you got me stressed
But you could probably care less
You're just so hard to impress
Every time that we go out
You do something to show out
Played the fool, but I know now

I always worry 'bout you
I only tell you the truth
I'm not like those other girls
I don't be acting brand new
Every time that we go out
You do something to show out
Played the fool, but I know now

[Chorus]
It could be U-S
There's too many letters
But it's only you, only you
Only, only, only you, only you

[Verse 2]
My friends say you not about me
I wasn't tryna believe it
I'm always holding you down
Even though you mess around
You ain't showing me no love
You just want me to show off
Played the fool but I know now

[Chorus]
It could be U-S
There's too many letters
But it's only you, only you
Only, only, only you, only you
It could be U-S
There's too many letters
But it's only you, only you
Only, only, only you, only you

[Bridge]
Boy, I wish that you would see
This could be us
Ooh, I'm so tired of you taking advantage of love

[Chorus]
It could be U-S
There's too many letters
But it's only you, only you
Only, only, only you, only you
It could be U-S
There's too many letters
But it's only you, only you
Only, only, only you, only you
