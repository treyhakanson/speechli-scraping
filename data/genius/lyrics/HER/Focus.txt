Title: Focus
Artist: H.E.R.

[Chorus]
Me—Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Babe—

[Verse 1]
Hands in the soap
Have the faucets running
And I keep looking at you
Stuck on your phone
And you're stuck in your zone
You don't have a clue

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't wanna give up
Baby, I just want you to get up
Lately I've been a little fed up
Wish you would just focus on

[Chorus]
Me—Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Me—Me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?

[Verse 2]
Lazy and broke?
No, he get this money
So I guess I can't complain
But I feel alone even when we're alone
And that don't cost a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't wanna give up
Baby, I just want you to get up
Lately I've been a little fed up
Wish you would just focus on

[Chorus]
Me—Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Baby—Me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Me—

[Outro]
Baby, focus
Can't you see?
I just wanna love you, baby
Look me in my eyes
