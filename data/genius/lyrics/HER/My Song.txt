Title: My Song
Artist: H.E.R.

[Intro]
Uhhh, yeah
Mmm, mm, mm

[Verse 1]
I wanna run away with you
Just take me to places I've never known
When no one else seems to be getting through
Only you can tell what's going on

[Pre-Chorus]
When I hear your name
Put a smile up on my face
It don't matter the time or the place
You make it all better now
I could love you forever now
When I hear the sound
When I'm feeling down
Ain't nobody else gotta be around
For you to make it better now
Let me get myself together now

[Chorus]
Let me sing my song
Don't wanna be alone
I know that when I listen
I find what I've been missing
Right here in my heart
Let me sing my song
I know this is my home
All that I've been wishing
I found what I've been missing
You were right here from the start
So let me sing my song

[Verse 2]
Everything that you've told me
I thank you every day for
All the things you wanted me to be
Is every thing I've prayed for
When the weight of the world is on my shoulders
You would take the away the pain (take away the pain)
Through the storm the sun still shines
With you by my side I'm not afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
When I hear you name
Put a smile up on my face
It don't matter the time or the place
You make it all better now
I could love you forever now
When I hear the sound
When I'm feeling down
Ain't nobody else gotta be around
For you to make it better now
Let me get myself together now

[Chorus]
Let me sing my song
Don't wanna be alone
I know that when I listen
I find what I've been missing
Right here in my heart
Let me sing my song
I know this is my home
All that I've been wishing
Found what I've been missing
You were right here from the start
So let me sing my song

[Verse 3]
All my doubts and fears
All my cries and tears
They all just disapear
When ever you, were near
You are still right here
You are still, oh right here
Right here
Right here
Right here
Still right here
Right here
Right here, right here, right here
Right here, right here
Right here, here
Right here, here, here, here
Right here
Right here
