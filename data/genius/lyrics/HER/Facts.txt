[Verse 1]
Come mess with a real one
If you're one in a million
Don't let a lot of people in
But you get admission
And I don't let my walls down
But I see us building
And you ain't a feeling
'Cause that's how I'm feeling

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me wanna put my phone down
When we're alone, I wanna zone out
Baby, with you, I ain't got no doubts
I'm just trying to let you know now

[Chorus]
Facts
You were the one I was missing
The opposite of fiction
And that's facts
Ooh, it's a given
I don't care 'bout opinions
And that's facts, facts
And that's facts
You were the one I was missing

[Verse 2]
Just the beginning
It don't get no better
As long as you hold me down
I'll be up for whatever
And I love the way you look at me
'Cause I see forever
Was ready before
But I want you now more than ever

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me wanna put my phone down
When we're alone, I wanna zone out
Baby, with you, I ain't got no doubts
I'm just trying to let you know now

[Chorus]
Facts
You were the one I was missing
The opposite of fiction
And that's facts
Ooh, it's a given
I don't care 'bout opinions
And that's facts, facts
And that's facts
You were the one I was missing

(You were the one I was missing
The opposite of fiction
And that's facts
Ooh, it's a given
I don't care 'bout opinions
And that's facts)

Facts
You were the one I was missing
The opposite of fiction
And that's facts
Ooh, it's a given
I don't care 'bout opinions
And that's facts, facts
And that's facts
You were the one I was missing

Facts
You were the one I was missing
The opposite of fiction
And that's facts
Ooh, it's a given
I don't care 'bout opinions
And that's facts, facts
And that's facts
You were the one I was missing
