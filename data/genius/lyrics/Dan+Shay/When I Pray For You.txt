Title: When I Pray For You
Artist: Dan + Shay

[Verse 1]
I talk to God about you
And I ain't even met you yet
Everybody's waitin' on you here
I can't wait to feel your heart beat
When I lay you on my chest
I'm already holding back my tears
I wanna be the dad that my dad was
I hope that I don't mess this whole thing up

[Chorus]
I pray you love like your momma
And you forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, that's what I do
When I pray for you
Oh, and I pray for you

[Verse 2]
I know you're gonna grow up some day
But don't forget to take your time
And take the time to call back home
It ain't always gonna be easy
It ain't always gonna be fair
I know you ain't always gonna need me
But I promise that I'll always be there

[Chorus]
I pray you love like your momma
And you forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, that's what I do
When I pray for you
Oh, and I pray for you

[Bridge]
I talk to God about you
When everything around me breaks
I look up and hear him say

[Chorus]
Love like your momma
And forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, thats what I do
When I pray for you
When I pray for you
When I pray for you
