Title: Nothin' Like You
Artist: Dan + Shay

[Verse 1]
I remember when I first met you
Sipping coffee in a corner booth
You were twirling your hair
And I just had to stare
For a minute or two

[Verse 2]
I was laughing at your stack of books
Then you shot me that smile
Hey beautiful girl, in your own little world
Let me in it

[Pre-Chorus]
You got all of my attention
And you ain't even trying
Yeah, you're my kind of different
And I never seen nothing

[Chorus]
Nothing like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Something about you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you

[Verse 2]
When you're wearing them worn out jeans
Purple untied shoestrings
You're a light in the dark
And you're stealing my heart like a gypsy

[Verse 3]
I love the way that you kiss me
In front of everybody
So baby come and kiss me
They ain't ever seen nothing

[Chorus]
Nothing like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Something about you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you, yeah
Nothing like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Nothing like you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you

[Outro]
Never seen, never seen nothing like you
Ain't never seen anything like you
Never seen nothin' like you
