Title: Keeping Score
Artist: Dan + Shay

[Verse 1: Dan + Shay]
Someday we're gonna look back on a night like tonight
The car I pulled up in, the necklace you're wearing won't even cross our minds
Someday we're gonna blink twice, say it happens like that
How much money we saved up for the time that we gave up
Well, it'll all just be math

[Chorus: Dan + Shay & Kelly Clarkson]
I know I'm only human
Don't know how many sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering what comes next
I just wanna love you like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close, enjoy you more
And spend a little less time keeping score

[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson  with Dan + Shay]
If we're rich to somebody, we're poor to somebody else
We could be happy and nameless
Or broken and famous
But, from what I can tell
Is that it doesn't really matter
You can't take it with you when you go
Life is only getting faster (life is only getting faster)
So, baby, I'd rather take tonight nice and slow

[Chorus: Dan + Shay & Kelly Clarkson]
'Cause I know I'm only human
Don't know how many sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering what comes next
I just wanna love you like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close, enjoy you more
And spend a little less time keeping score

[Bridge: Dan + Shay with Kelly Clarkson]
Be with me now
Be with me right now
Be with me right here, right now
Be with me now
Be with me right now
Be with me right here, right now

[Outro: Dan + Shay & Kelly Clarkson]
I know I'm only human
Don't know how many sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering what comes next
I just wanna love you like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close, enjoy you more
And spend a little less time keeping score
Oh, yeah
Keeping score
