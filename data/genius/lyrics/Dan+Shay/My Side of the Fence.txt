Title: My Side of the Fence
Artist: Dan + Shay

[Verse 1]
These fancy things in magazines
Diamond rings and beauty queens
But nothin' seems to sparkle like you do
These fine cigars and caviar
Expensive cars and movie stars
But everything I need is in this room
Oh, and I've seen the lights from New York to Vegas
And I've tasted wine from Venice to Paris
And I've seen the sights
Nothin' comparin' to you

[Chorus]
So I ain't lookin' over fences tryna find a better view
My search for all that ended when I first laid eyes on you
And the grass is always greener
'Cause the sun shines when you smile
And when I'm holdin' you the world makes sense
On my side of the fence

[Verse 2]
If I ever win the lottery
It wouldn't mean a lot to me, 'cause I already got you to hold my hand
And if a genie gave me a million wishes
I'd spend them all on all your kisses
And save just one to stay right where I am

[Chorus]
So I ain't lookin' over fences tryna find a better view
My search for all that ended when I first laid eyes on you
And the grass is always greener
'Cause the sun shines when you smile
And when I'm holdin' you the world makes sense
On my side of the fence

[Bridge]
You're the rain on the roof in the summer
You're the leaves in the fall changing color
You're the whisper I hear in the thunder
On my side of the fence
You're the reason my heart's beating faster
You're the tears falling down from the laughter
You're the only one I'm after

[Chorus]
So I ain't looking over fences trying to find a better view
My search for all that ended when I first laid eyes on you
And the grass is always greener
'Cause the sun shines when you smile
And when I'm holdin' you the world makes sense
Baby, when I'm holdin' you the world makes sense
On my side of the fence

[Outro]
You know it does, baby
On my side of the fence
Ooh
