Title: May We All
Artist: Florida Georgia Line

[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
May we all get to grow up in our red white and blue little town
Get a won't start hand me down Ford to try to fix up
With some part time cash from driving a tractor
Find a sweet little thang, wears your ball cap backwards
Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does
Cause you miss it too much

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
Hope you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw]
May we all get to see those fields of green turn gold
Watch a marching band play with the harvest moon coming up
And know that fifteen minutes of famous
Ain't gonna be what makes us or breaks us but
We'll all be watching the TV the day that it comes

[Chorus: Tim McGraw]
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
'Fore you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

[Verse 3: Both]
May we all do a little bit better than the first time
Learn a little something from the worst times
Get a little stronger from the hurt times
May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one
Walk away wiser when we crashed one
Keep hoping that the best one is the last one

[Outro]
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all (get to have a chance to ride the fast one)
May we all (walk away wiser when we crashed one)
May we all (keep hoping that the best one is the last one)
(yeah the last one)
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all
