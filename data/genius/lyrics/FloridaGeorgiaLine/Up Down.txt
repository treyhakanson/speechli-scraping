Title: Up Down
Artist: Morgan Wallen

[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
It's Friday after 5, got here just in time
Went ahead and wet a line 'fore I went and lost my mind
I ain't been here long, but the bobber's in the pond
Going up down, up, down, up, down
Tonight, we're gonna raise a whole lot more than cane
'Cause there's money in the bank and tomorrow's Saturday
So if they pass that fifth of Jack this way
I turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Florida Georgia Line]
We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up down...here

[Verse 2: Florida Georgia Line]
Yeah, the girls, they hit the spot, even hotter when it's hot
If you can't buy her a yacht, but still proud of what you got
'Cause when the day's done, red neck is from the sun
Going up, down, up, down, up, down

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Florida Georgia Line]
We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down here

[Bridge: Morgan Wallen & Florida Georgia Line]
Somebody pass that fifth of Camp this way
I'll turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

[Chorus: Both, Morgan Wallen]
We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down here
