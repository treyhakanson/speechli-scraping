Title: Cruise
Artist: Florida Georgia Line

[Intro]
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby

[Verse 1]
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
Sheâ€™s popping right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, "Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs"
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

[Chorus]
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 2]
She was sipping on Southern and singing Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
"Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck"

[Chorus]
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 3]
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right

[Verse 4]
I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumping
Hell, I can't get you out of my head

[Interlude]
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you

[Chorus]
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Come on
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Outro]
Come on, girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aww, yeah
