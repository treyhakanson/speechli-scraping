Title: Cruise (Remix)
Artist: Florida Georgia Line

[Intro: Brian Kelley & Tyler Hubbard]
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Let's go!

I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio up
What up Nelly, alright
I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio up

[Verse 1: Brian Kelley & Tyler Hubbard]
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, "Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs"
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said

[Chorus: Brian Kelley & Tyler Hubbard]
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Come on
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Bridge: Brian Kelley & Tyler Hubbard]
I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio up

[Verse 2: Brian Kelley & Tyler Hubbard]
Yeah, she was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
"Fire it up, let’s go get this thing stuck"

[Chrous: Brian Kelley & Tyler Hubbard]
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 3: Nelly]
My windows down my seats back
My music up and we ride
Her legs up on my dashboard
And it's just the way I like
Hey country girl, this country boy
Like e'rything about you
Don't change a thing, no way
You stay the same and I got you
I likes all that, all that
Head to toe you all that
Tell ole boy he can call back
Send her a text say, "fall back" 'cause
I can see you got a thing for the fast life
So come on, shawty, let me show you what the fast like
Whipping 'cross the border, Florida into Georgia
Cause baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every hood, every town with you
And this drop-top Chevy painted real slick
It would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Cause baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my, roll my, roll my
R-r-r-r-roll

[Chorus: Brian Kelley & Tyler Hubbard]
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Outro: Brian Kelley & Tyler Hubbard]
I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio up
I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio up
I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio up
