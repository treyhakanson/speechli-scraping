Title: Let Me Go
Artist: Hailee Steinfeld & Alesso

[Verse 1: Hailee Steinfeld]
You made plans and I, I made problems
We were sleeping back to back
We know this thing wasn't built to last
Good on paper, picture perfect
Chased the high too far, too fast
Picket white fence, but we paint it black

[Pre-Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Ooh, and I wished you had hurt me harder than I hurt you
Ooh, and I wish you wouldn't wait for me, but you always do

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I've been hopin'
Somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of
All of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hopin'
Someone will love you, let me go

[Post-Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Someone will love you, let me go
I've been hoping someone will love you, let me go

[Verse 2: Florida Georgia Line]
It's been some time, but this time ain't even
I can leave it in the past
But you're holding on to what you never had
It's good on paper, picture perfect
Chased the high too far, too fast
Picket white fence, but we paint it black

[Pre-Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Ooh, and I wished you had hurt me harder than I hurt you
Ooh, and I wish you wouldn't wait for me but you always do

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I've been hopin'
Somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of
All of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hopin'
Someone will love you, let me go

[Post-Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Someone will love you, let me go
I've been hoping someone will love you, let me go (go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go (go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go (go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go (go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go

[Outro: Hailee Steinfeld]
I've been hoping somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of all of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hoping someone will love you, let me go
