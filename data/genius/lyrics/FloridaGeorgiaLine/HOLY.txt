Title: HOLY
Artist: Florida Georgia Line

[Verse 1]
When the sun had left and the winter came
And the sky fall to only bring the rain
I sat in darkness
All broken-hearted
I couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone
I never meant to cry, started losin' hope
But somehow, baby
You broke through and saved me

[Pre-Chorus]
You're an angel, tell me you're never leavin'
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in

[Chorus]
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you

[Verse 2]
You made the brightest days from the darkest nights
You're the river bank where I was baptized
Cleansed from the demons
That were killin' my freedom
Let me lay you down, give me to ya
Get you singin', babe, hallelujah
We'll be touchin'
We'll be touchin' heaven

[Pre-Chorus]
You're an angel, tell me you're never leavin'
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in

[Chorus]
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you

[Bridge]
I don't need the stars 'cause you shine for me
Like fire in my veins, you're my ecstasy
You're my ecstasy

[Chorus]
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you

[Outro]
You're the healin' hands where it used to hurt
You're my savin' grace, you're my kind of church
You're holy
