Title: Here Comes the Sun
Artist: The Beatles

[Intro]
Here comes the sun, doo doo doo doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Verse 1]
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Verse 2]
Little darling, the smiles are returning to their faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Bridge]
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

[Verse 3]
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Outro]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
It's all right
It's all right
