Title: Yesterday
Artist: The Beatles

[Verse 1]
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Verse 2]
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Chorus]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Chorus]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
