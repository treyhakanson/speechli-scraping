Title: Let It Be
Artist: The Beatles

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
“Let it be”
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
“Let it be”

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
And when the brokenhearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on till tomorrow
Let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
