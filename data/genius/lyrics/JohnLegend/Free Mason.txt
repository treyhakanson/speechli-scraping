Title: Free Mason
Artist: Rick Ross

[Intro: Rick Ross]
This is for the soldiers that see the sun at midnight, ya dig?
Let me slow down (it’s so incredible)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
We the lost symbols speak in cryptic code
Ancient wisdom valuable like gifts of Gold
I embark on life, my path is all math
I understand the codes these hackers can’t crack
I understand that folks expect me to fold
Community control to violate parole
I won't fail, but a lot of men will
I’m iconic in the field like Solomon's Seal
Uh, it’s just the intro
Allow my flow time to sink into the tempo
Free Mason, freelancer
Free agents (me!), we faster (haha!)
Big contracts, big contractors
Built pyramids, period, we masters
No caterpillars, it was just a lot of niggas
A lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors
All white mansion, I’m the child of God
All black diamonds, times were hard
New Rolls Royce, guess you made it, nigga
All-white neighborhood, you they favorite nigga
My top back like JFK
They wanna push my top back like JFK
So, so I "JFK"
Join forces with the kings and we ate all day
Right now I could rewrite history
I stopped writing, so fuck it I’ll do it mentally

[Hook: Rick Ross & John Legend]
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Niggas couldn’t do nothing with me, they put the devil on me
I would have preferred niggas squeeze the metal on me
Rumors of Lucifer, I don’t know who to trust
Whole world want my demise; turn the music up
Hear me clearly
If y’all niggas fear me, just say y'all fear me
Fuck all these fairy tales; go to Hell, this is God engineering
This is a Hail Mary pass, y’all interfering
He without sin shall cast the first stone
So y’all look in the mirror, double-check your appearance
Bitch, I said I was amazing
Not that I’m a Mason
It’s amazing, that I made it through the maze that I was in
Lord forgive me, I never would’ve made it without sin
Holy water, my face in the basin
Diamonds in my Rosary shows, he forgave him
Bitch I’m red-hot, I’m on my 3rd 6
But a devil I’m not, my Jesus-piece flooded
But thou shall not covet, keep your eyes off my cupboard
I’m a bad motherfucker, it's Hov, just say you love it

[Hook: Rick Ross & John Legend]
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die

[Verse 3: John Legend]
If I ever die, never let it be said I didn’t win
Never, never say, never say Legend didn’t go in (I'ma go in)
I just wanna die on top of the world
And mkin love to my favorite girl
I'm making beautiful music, we making a movie
We knew we was born to do it

[Hook: Rick Ross & John Legend]
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
