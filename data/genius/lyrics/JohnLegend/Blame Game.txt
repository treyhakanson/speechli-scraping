Title: Blame Game
Artist: Kanye West

[Produced by DJ Frank E, Kanye West & Mike Dean]

[Intro: Kanye West]
Whose fault?

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 1: John Legend]
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

[Chorus: John Legend]
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else"
I took a piss and dismiss it like "fuck it"
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you
Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Rubbin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1AM and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, "Yeezy, I ain't your right girl"
You'll probably find one of them "I like art"-type girls
All of the lights, she-was-caught-in-the-hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure

[Interlude: Kanye West]
"Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely" - Chloe Mitchell

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much

[Outro: Kanye West]
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing

["The Best Birthday": Chris Rock]
Ohh my God
Baby, you done took this shit to another mother fucking level!
Now a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be getting no pussy like this
God damn, God damn!
Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?
(Yeezy taught me)
You never used to talk dirty, but now you God damn disgusting!
My, my God, where'd you learn that?
(Yeezy taught me)
Look at you mother fucking butt ass naked...
With them motherfucking Jimmy Choos on...
Who taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level!
This is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now! Shit!
You done went all porno on a nigga, okay? And I, and I love it...
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!
How did you learn, how... how did your pussy game come up?
(Yeezy taught me)
I was fucking parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before!
I was in there like "Oh, shit! I never been here before!
I've never even seen this part of pussy town before!"
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit. What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?
(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy. And when I see that nigga, I'mma thank him. I'mma buy the album, I'mma download that motherfucker, I'm-a shoot a bootlegger!
That's how good I feel about this nigga
Oww, I still can't believe you got me this watch!
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted!
Even with the bezel! This is the motherfucker I wanted!
I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in The Source!
I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source!
That's right, that's right! Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!
Where'd you learn to treat a nigga like this?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you well
