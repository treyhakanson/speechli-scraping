[Verse 1]
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up (hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus ]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

[Verse 2]
Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up (hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(You'll hear me roar)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

[Bridge]
Roar, roar, roar, roar, roar...

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(You'll hear me roar)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar
