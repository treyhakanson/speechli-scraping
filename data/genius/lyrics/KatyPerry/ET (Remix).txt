Title: ET (Remix)
Artist: Katy Perry

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I got a dirty mind, I got filthy ways
I’m tryna bathe my ape in your Milky Way
I’m a legend, I'm irreverent, I be reverend
I’ll be so faaaaa-ar up
We don't give a fuh-uh-uck
Welcome to the danger zone
Step into the fantasy
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
They callin' me an alien, a big headed astronaut
Maybe it's because ya boy Yeezy get ass a lot

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
You’re so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You’re not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don’t understand you

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I’m ready to go, lead me into the light

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you’re an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It’s supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Verse 3: Katy Perry]
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I’m ready to go, lead me into the light

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you’re an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It’s supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I know a bar out in Mars
Where they driving spaceships instead of cars
Cop a Prada space suit about the stars
Getting stupid high straight up out the jars
Pockets on Shrek, rockets on deck
Tell me what's next? Alien sex
I'mma disrobe you
Then I'mma probe you
See I abducted you
So I tell you what to do
I tell you what to do, what to do

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you’re an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It’s supernatural
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial

[Outro: Katy Perry]
Boy, you’re an alien
Your touch are foreign
It’s supernatural
Extraterrestrial
