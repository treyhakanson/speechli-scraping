Title: Witness
Artist: Katy Perry

[Verse 1]
If I lost it all today, would you stay?
Could my love be enough to stimulate?
If shit hit the fan, grenades got thrown
Would you still show, oh?
Could you go down with me to the mat?
Could we get back up and eventually laugh?
Roll eyes at highs, cheers in the lows, and stay in the flow, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I, I only got this life
And I ain't got the time, no
Not to get it right, oh

[Chorus]
We're all just looking for connection
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone to ride this ride with me
Can I get a witness? (witness)
Will you be my witness? (witness)
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this
Looking for a witness to get me through this

[Verse 2]
When you tell me everything, and there's no holes
You can scroll through anything, you've got the codes
Nothing to hide, it's all in their eyes
And we just know, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I, I only got this life
And I ain't got the time, no
Not to get it right, oh

[Chorus]
We're all just looking for connection
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone to ride this ride with me
Can I get a witness? (witness)
Will you be my witness? (witness)
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this
Looking for a witness to get me through this

[Bridge]
Will you be my witness?
Could you be the one that speaks for me?
Will you be my witness?

[Chorus]
We're all just looking for connection (we're all just looking)
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone (to ride this ride) to ride this ride with me (with me)
Can I get a witness? (witness)
Will you be my witness? (witness)
(Will you be my witness?)
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this
Looking for a witness to get me through this

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh (ah)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ooh-ooh
Hey (ah)
Oh-oh-oh
Hey
