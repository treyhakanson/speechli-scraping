Title: Girlfriend
Artist: Avril Lavigne

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don’t like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend

[Verse 1]
You’re so fine, I want you mine, you’re so delicious
I think about you all the time, you’re so addictive
Don’t you know what I can do to make you feel alright?
Don’t pretend, I think you know I’m damn precious
And hell yeah, I'm the motherfucking princess
I can tell you like me too and you know I’m right

[Pre-Chorus]
She’s like so whatever
You could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that’s what everyone’s talking about

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don’t like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend

[Verse 2]
I can see the way, I see the way you look at me
And even when you look away, I know you think of me
I know you talk about me all the time again and again
So come over here and tell me what I want to hear
Better yet, make your girlfriend disappear
I don’t want to hear you say her name ever again
And again, and again, and again

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she’s like so whatever
And you could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that’s what everyone’s talking about

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don’t like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend

[Bridge]
In a second, you’ll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There’s no other, so when's it gonna sink in?
She’s so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?
In a second, you’ll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There’s no other, so when's it gonna sink in?
She’s so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don’t like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend (no way, no way)
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend (no way, no way)

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don’t like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend (no way, no way)
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me (no way)
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret (no way)
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend (no way, no way)
Hey, hey!
