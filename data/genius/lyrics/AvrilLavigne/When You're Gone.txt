Title: When You're Gone
Artist: Avril Lavigne

[Verse 1]
I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie is made up on your side

[Pre-Chorus]
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

[Chorus]
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

[Verse 2]
I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do, reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lay on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do

[Pre-Chorus]
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

[Chorus]
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

[Bridge]
We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were, yeah, yeah
All I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul
I can hardly breathe, I need to feel you here with me, yeah

[Chorus]
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
Will always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you
