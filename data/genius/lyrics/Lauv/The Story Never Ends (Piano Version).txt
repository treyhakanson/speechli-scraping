Title: The Story Never Ends (Piano Version)
Artist: Lauv

[Verse 1]
Stick, stick to your stones cause that's all you know
I was caught in the middle
I swallow my words down to the bone
Cause nothing's that simple

[Pre-Chorus]
Late at night you pour it out
Know that only brings you down

[Chorus]
But go ahead give me all the blame
Twist my words and set them to flame, woah
We all know
That you'll go tell all of your friends
That I'm the one you wish you never met
And woah
We all know

The story never ends, ends
The story never ends, ends

[Verse 2]
Wound me like a toy spinning too fast
In every direction
How, how could I stay when you lit a match to all my intentions?

[Pre-Chorus]
Late at night you pour it out
Know that only brings you down

[Chorus]
But go ahead give me all the blame
Twist my words and set them to flame, woah
We all know
That you'll go tell all of your friends
That I'm the one you wish you never met
And woah
We all know

The story never ends, ends
The story never ends, ends

[Bridge]
Thatâ€™s who you are
Crash the car
And blame the road

Never your fault
After all
I would know

The story never ends

The story..

The story never ends, ends
The story never ends, ends

The story..
The story..
The story..
The story..
