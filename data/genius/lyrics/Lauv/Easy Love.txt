Title: Easy Love
Artist: Lauv

[Verse 1]
You got a way of makin' me feel insane
Like I can't trust my own brain
Unless it's screaming your name
I'd have it no other way
I'd have it no other way
And maybe that's why I stay
How many times can we pick up the same fight?
Can we keep screaming all night
And make up until it's light?
That's when I say that you're right
And feel your body on mine
Oh maybe that's why I stay

[Chorus]
I could be somewhere chillin' on the beach
I could be with someone makin' me happy
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
I could put my phone down, just pick up my keys
I could let you go, and we could let it be
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love

[Verse 2]
Keep comin' back, guess you could say I'm attached
Last time we called it a wrap, I came beggin' and all that
You're like a habit, it's bad
I got a habit, it's bad
Oh no, I'm not even mad

[Chorus]
I could be somewhere chillin' on the beach
I could be with someone makin' me happy
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
I could put my phone down, just pick up my keys
I could let you go, and we could let it be
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love

[Bridge]
It's the way you keep me up all night
It's the way you make me lose my mind
Every time I'm sayin' one more night
It's the way you know I'm yours
It's the way you know I'm yours for life

[Chorus]
'Cause I could be somewhere chillin' on the beach
I could be with someone makin' me happy
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
I could put my phone down, just pick up my keys
I could let you go, and we could let it be
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
