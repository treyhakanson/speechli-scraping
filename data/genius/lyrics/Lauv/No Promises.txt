Title: No Promises
Artist: Cheat Codes

[Verse 1: Demi Lovato]
Cutting me up like a knife
And I feel it, deep in my bones
Kicking a habit I love even harder
You oughta know

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I just wanna dive in the water, with you
Baby, we can't see the bottom
It's so easy to fall for each other
I'm just hoping we catch one another

[Chorus: Trevor Dahl]
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises

[Drop: Cheat Codes]

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
Baby, I think about you
And I feel it, deep in my heart
Maybe we just ain't meant to be something
Maybe we are, ooh?

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I just wanna dive in the water, with you
Baby, we can't see the bottom
It's so easy to fall for each other
I'm just hoping we catch one another

[Chorus: Trevor Dahl & Demi Lovato]
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises, oh

[Drop: Cheat Codes]

[Bridge: Trevor Dahl & Demi Lovato]
I just wanna dive in the water
Oh baby, we can't see the bottom
I just want to dive in with you
I just want to lie here with you, oh

[Chorus: Trevor Dahl & Demi Lovato]
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises (promise me)
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises, no

[Drop: Cheat Codes]

[Outro: Trevor Dahl & Demi Lovato]
Promise me no promises
Don't you promise me nothing
Promise me, me, me, me
Just be careful
Promise me no promises
