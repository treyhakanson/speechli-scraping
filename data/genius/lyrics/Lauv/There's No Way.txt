Title: There's No Way
Artist: Lauv

[Verse 1: Lauv]
You touch me and it’s almost like we knew
That there will be history between us two
We knew someday that we would have regrets
But we just ignored them the night we met
We just dance backwards into each other
Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered
You touch me and it’s almost like we knew
That there will be history

[Chorus: Lauv & Julia Michaels]
But there’s no way that it’s not going there
With the way that we’re looking at each other
There’s no way that it’s not going there
Every second with you, I want another
But maybe we could hold off for one sec
So we could keep this tension in check
But there’s no way that it’s not going there
With the way that we’re looking at each other

[Verse 2: Julia Michaels, Lauv & Both]
I wish I could make the time stop
So we could forget everything and everyone
I wish that the time would line up
So we could just give in to what we want
'Cause when I got somebody, you don't
And when you got somebody, I don't
I wish that the time would line up
So we could just give in

[Chorus: Lauv & Julia Michaels]
But there’s no way that it’s not going there
(Going, it's not going there)
With the way that we’re looking at each other
There’s no way that it’s not going there
(Going, it's not going there)
Every second with you, I want another
But maybe we could hold off for one sec
So we could keep this tension in check
But there’s no way that it’s not going there
(Going, it's not going there)
With the way that we’re looking at each other

[Bridge: Lauv & Julia Michaels]
We just dance backwards into each other
Tryna keep our feelings secretly covered
We just dance backwards into each other
(We just keep on dancing)
Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered
(Right into each other)
You touched me and it's almost like we knew
That there would be history

[Chorus: Lauv & Julia Michaels]
But there’s no way that it’s not going there
(Going, it's not going there)
With the way that we’re looking at each other
There’s no way that it’s not going there
(Going, it's not going there)
Every second with you, I want another
But maybe we could hold off for one sec
So we could keep this tension in check
But there’s no way that it’s not going there
(Going, it's not going there)
With the way that we’re looking at each other

[Outro: Lauv & Julia Michaels]
We just keep on dancing right into each other
We just keep on dancing right into each other
