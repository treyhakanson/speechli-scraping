Title: The Other
Artist: Lauv

[Verse 1]
Like a spotlight the water hits me
Ran it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth
Though I know that no one’s listening
I nervously rehearse for when you’re around

And I keep waiting like you might change my mind

[Chorus]
Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there’s nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

[Verse 2]
Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty
Cause I just can’t stop this pendulum in my head
Though I know that our time is ending
I’d rather lay forever right in this bed

And I keep waiting like, you might change my mind
Give me one more night

[Chorus]
Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there’s nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

[Pre-Chorus]
No one knows (knows)
No one knows (knows)

[Bridge]
We fell from the peak
And the stars, they broke their code
I’m trying to forget
How I landed on this road
I’m caught in between
What I wish and what I know
When they say that you just know

[Chorus]
Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there’s nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

[Pre-Chorus]
No one knows (knows)
No one knows (knows)
No one knows (knows)

[Outro]
You set the other on fire
You set the other on fire
(You set the other on fire, you set the other on fire)
