Title: Any Ol' Barstool
Artist: Jason Aldean

[Verse 1]
I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth you gotta go straight to the source

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

[Verse 2]
I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far
But fillin' in all these blanks you left isn't all that hard
No, I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with
I guess you didn't hurt me half as bad as you think you did

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

[Bridge]
Yeah, you think I'm down and out, hidin' out, hell-bent crazy
But that ain't me, baby

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
But I'm a long way from broke down
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool
Ask any ol' barstool

[Outro]
I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
