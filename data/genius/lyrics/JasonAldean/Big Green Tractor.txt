Title: Big Green Tractor
Artist: Jason Aldean

[Verse 1]
She had a shiny little Beamer with the ragtop down
Sitting in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barking and a wagging around
And I just laughed and said you all get in

[Verse 2]
She had on a new dress and she curled her hair
She was looking too good not to go somewhere
Said what you want to do baby I don't care
We can go to the show, or we can stay right here

[Chorus]
And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town or baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

[Verse 3]
Said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house

[Chorus]
Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

[Bridge]
Just let me dust of the seat
Put your pretty little arms around me, hell yeah

[Chorus]
You can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town or baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

[Outro]
Oh yeah, we can go to town
Or we can go another round
On my big green tractor
