Title: Drowns the Whiskey
Artist: Jason Aldean

[Verse 1: Jason Aldean]
All the folks down in Lynchburg, Tennessee
Been working hard for good ol' boys like me
I don't wanna be the one to tell 'em
That stuff that they've been selling
Ain't working like it should
But I damn sure wish it would

[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Miranda Lambert]
Whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

[Verse 2: Jason Aldean & Miranda Lambert]
Maybe it's the bar or the stool I'm on
Maybe it's the band and the sad old song
That keeps me buying rounds
That keeps me turning down
Any girl that wants to dance
And you ain't giving them a chance

[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Miranda Lambert]
Whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

[Bridge: Jason Aldean & Miranda Lambert]
Girl, I'm living proof that 80 proof
Ain't got a shot at touching you

[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Miranda Lambert]
But whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey
Yeah the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

[Outro: Jason Aldean & Miranda Lambert]
All the folks down in Lynchburg, Tennessee
Been working hard for good old boys like me
