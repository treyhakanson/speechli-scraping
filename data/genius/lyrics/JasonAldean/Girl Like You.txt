Title: Girl Like You
Artist: Jason Aldean

[Verse 1]
Love how you close your eyes when I pull you in closer
Tonight's moving fast but we ain't taking it slower
You hit me harder than a drink does
You're gonna take me all the way up
Something about you baby, got me going crazy
I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you

[Verse 2]
Love how you say my name and make it sound so sexy
Love how you do that thing, yeah you know what gets me
I'm talking slow motion all night long
Baby, love you with the lights on

[Chorus]
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you

[Chorus]
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you
I've never met a girl like you
