Title: Burning Bridges
Artist: Ludacris

[Hook: Jason Aldean]
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I done took all I could take from you
Need a little bit more than a break from you
Matter of fact fuck you, don't need you in my life
You done did so much wrong I hope you get it right
But not at my expense, I did all I could do
You just took me for granted, you thought I was a fool
When I did everything in my power to help and please you
But I don't know you no more, fuck it, I caught amnesia
Too many emotions I try to bury
But the higher I climb, the less weight I'm trying to carry
Dem niggas holdin' on for dear life, bringin' me drama
But I'm only responsible for my daughters Cai and Karma
Nigga you's a grown man, get yourself together
Forget about the past, now's a better time than never
Matter of fact, It's time to start making better decisions
So put your fires out, and stop burning 'Cris' bridges
You little bitches

[Hook: Jason Aldean]
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Yeah, this industry's full of bullshitters
And all this time you thought you had me fooled niggas
In my ferrari partner thought he saw a spaceship
Cos I move in speed not to get caught up in this fake shit
Smiling in my face when I'm around y'all
But soon as I leave, niggas be prayin' on my down fall
Is it cause you'll never sell as many records?
My bitches always look better, you fail at business endeavours?
Or that people thought you were clever, but now they know you stupid?
And misery loves company now that you're going through it?
Somebody tell these rappers I walk hard in these Louis
So get out of here, you don't want no part of this shit, Dewey
I see them drugs got y'all trippin' too soon
That's why you find me in the club, every once in a blue moon
So while you contemplate making your first million
I'll be somewhere contemplating on making my first billion
And then, trillion

[Hook: Jason Aldean]
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
The biggest mistake we make as individuals
Is thinking everyone lives by the same principles
But when I talk by the same teachers and principals
For you to know it's not the money, it's the principle
So I can't expect you to know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Our issues are deep within, we can't just talk 'em out
Niggas is fighting inside, we can't just walk 'em out
These bridges burning so fast, we can't just stomp 'em out
As if you know what I'm talkin' 'bout

[Hook: Jason Aldean]
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go
