Title: Dirt Road Anthem
Artist: Jason Aldean

[Chorus]
I'm chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like I'm George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An' ice cold beer sitting' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turning off of real life, driving' that's right
I'm hitting' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 1]
Back in the day Potts farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue

[Verse 2]
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something ya'll don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talking, man, ya'll ain't listening
Them old dirt roads is what ya'll missing

[Chorus]
I'm chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like I'm George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An' ice cold beer sitting' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turning off of real life, driving' that's right
I'm hitting' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 3]
I sit back and think about them good ole days
The way we were raised, and our southern ways
And we like cornbread, and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take ya'll where ya need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods

[Verse 4]
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good, and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends

[Chorus]
I'm chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like I'm George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An' ice cold beer sitting' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turning off of real life, driving' that's right
I'm hitting' easy street on mud tires

I'm chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like I'm George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An' ice cold beer sitting' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turning off of real life, driving' that's right
I'm hitting' easy street on mud tires
That's right
