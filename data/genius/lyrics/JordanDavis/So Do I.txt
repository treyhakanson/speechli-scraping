Title: So Do I
Artist: Jordan Davis

[Verse 1]
Well if you got a plan in mind
Tell me when and where and I'm down
Girl, I'm so down
Cause we ain't got nothing but time
I want to know what you're thinking about
So just let it out

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause we got the start of something good
And it's starting right now
There's no needing dancing around
What we've lucked into
And you look like you

[Chorus]
Wanna catch a red-eye to the coast somewhere
Watch the moon fall and listen to the waves roll by
So do I
If you see a Santa Fe sunset, a burning red sky
As the backdrop of your lips getting closer to mine
So do I
If you don't want to say goodbye just yet
Think we got a lot more left to do tonight, yeah tonight
So do I

[Verse 2]
Maybe it's just one more drink
Just you and me watching that clock spin 'round
And 'round
I just want to do what you're thinking
I'm up for staying or leaving this town

[Chorus]
If you wanna catch a red-eye to the coast somewhere
Watch the moon fall and listen to the waves roll by
So do I
If you see a Santa Fe sunset, a burning red sky
As the backdrop of your lips getting closer to mine
So do I
If you don't want to say goodbye just yet
Think we got a lot more left to do tonight, yeah tonight
So do I

[Chorus]
If you wanna catch a red-eye to the coast somewhere
Watch the moon fall and listen to the waves roll by
So do I
If you see a Santa Fe sunset, a burning red sky
As the backdrop of your lips getting closer to mine
So do I
If you don't want to say goodbye just yet
Think we got a lot more left to do tonight, yeah tonight
So do I
So do I
