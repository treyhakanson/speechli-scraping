Title: Dreamed You Did
Artist: Jordan Davis

[Verse 1]
Last night it was so real
I can still feel
You all over me
And I woke up reaching for you
Wanting to hold you
Damn everything felt right
Last night

[Chorus]
When you called me
Said you want me
Told me you were coming over
Said you're running red lights
At 85 and getting closer
A kiss at the door, ended up on the floor
Ain't too sure what hurts more
That you didn't or that I dreamed you did

[Verse 2]
Yeah we said everything we didn't say
Without saying a word at all
I tried like hell to fall back asleep
Just to see if maybe we
Could pick back up where we left off

[Chorus]
When you called me
Said you want me
Told me you were coming over
Said you're running red lights
At 85 and getting closer
A kiss at the door, ended up on the floor
Ain't too sure what hurts more
That you didn't or that I dreamed you did

[Bridge]
Is it worse that you're so gone
That I don't even cross your mind
Or that I'll be dreaming that you're coming back again tonight

[Chorus]
When you called me
Said you want me
Told me you were coming over
Said you're running red lights
At 85 and getting closer
A kiss at the door, ended up on the floor
Ain't too sure what hurts more
That you didn't or that I dreamed you did

[Outro]
I dreamed you did
Yeah I dreamed you did
Yeah I dreamed you did
