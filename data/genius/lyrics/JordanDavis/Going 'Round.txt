Title: Going 'Round
Artist: Jordan Davis

[Verse 1]
I still got your number and I wonder
What you're doing tonight
I heard you were hurting but he wasn't worth it
Well I could've told you he wasn't right

[Pre-Chorus]
Well some buddies of mine
They said you had a big fight in town
You ran off crying
At least that's what's going around

[Chorus]
Know how those rumors fly
Sometimes they're all a lie
Burn up before they hit the ground
But right now they're going 'round
I don't wanna move in too soon
I know your heartbreak is brand new
If I never would've let you down
This probably wouldn't be going 'round

[Post-Chorus]
(Round and round and round and round)
Probably wouldn't be going 'round

[Verse 2]
It might've been time
And it might've been my bad
But I wanna try again
Another dance
A second chance
If you are in, I'd be in

[Pre-Chorus]
Well some buddies of mine
They said you had a big fight in town
You ran off crying
At least that's what's going around

[Chorus]
Know how those rumors fly
Sometimes they're all a lie
Burn up before they hit the ground
But right now they're going 'round
I don't wanna move in too soon
I know your heartbreak is brand new
If I never would've let you down
This probably wouldn't be going 'round

[Post-Chorus]
Probably wouldn't be going 'round

[Pre-Chorus]
Well some buddies of mine
They said you had a big fight in town
You ran off crying
At least that's what's going 'round

[Chorus]
Know how those rumors fly
Sometimes they're all a lie
Burn up before they hit the ground
But right now they're going 'round
I don't wanna move in too soon
I know your heartbreak is brand new
If I never would've let you down
This probably wouldn't be going 'round

[Post-Chorus]
Probably wouldn't be going 'round

(Round and round and round and round)
