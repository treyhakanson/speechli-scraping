Title: Take It From Me
Artist: Jordan Davis

[Verse 1]
I think me and you should blow this off
So much for the after-party
Let's tell everybody we got lost
I think me and you should do our own thing
Our own way
At my place, far away

[Chorus]
Take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby, you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulder
Now give them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me, running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me

[Verse 2]
Baby, you should stop right now, right here
Right where we wanna be
I'll spin you around and let's just see
Where this thing goes
All I know is that I'm all yours, all night
I've got nothing but time

[Chorus]
So take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby, you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulder
Now give me them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me, running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me
Take it from me, yeah

[Bridge]
But you can steal a kiss, I won't call you a thief
But take it from me
What I got to give you can have for free
Just take it from me

[Chorus]
Take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby, you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulders
Now give me them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me, running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me
Just take it from me

[Outro]
Take my word, take my heart
Take my kiss and maybe take it too far
But baby take it from me
Oh, just take it from me
But you can steal a kiss, I won't call you a thief
But take it from me
What I got to give you can have for free
Just take it from me
Oh, just take it from me
