Title: Slow Dance in a Parking Lot
Artist: Jordan Davis

[Verse 1]
Lights go down, wheels go 'round
I'm taking you home
Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now
I'm not ready to shut it down
The way the dashboard glow
Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind

And get close to you
Making the most of whatever we got, even if it's just

[Chorus]
A slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot
