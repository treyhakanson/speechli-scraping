Title: Leaving New Orleans
Artist: Jordan Davis

[Verse 1]
I miss the Quarter
The magnolias and the Pontchartrain
French market on a Saturday
I'll miss the feel of this place
I miss the Bayou sunrise
The Mardi Gras and the Saga Lines
Bourbon, jazz, sidewalk kids
With bottle cap taps, dancing for tips

[Chorus]
But I'm leaving New Orleans
There's too much of you in this town
Your memory is like moss in the trees
Every corner it's just hanging around
Well, The Big Easy ain't so easy
Hard to say it but baby come morning
I'll be rolling like the Mississippi leaving New Orleans

[Verse 2]
Well I like highways
So maybe LA is the place for me
If I point these wheels toward the Hollywood sign
All those miles to clear my mind
Or I could watch a horse race on some bluegrass
Where bourbon's made
Catch some rays in the Sunshine State
Hit Seattle if I need a little rain

[Chorus]
But I'm leaving New Orleans
There's too much of you in this town
Your memory's like moss in the trees
Every corner it's just hanging around
Well, The Big Easy ain't so easy
Hard to say it but baby come morning
I'll be rolling like the Mississippi leaving New Orleans

[Bridge]
I guess our good times have rolled away
Well laissez les bons temps rouler

[Chorus]
I'm leaving New Orleans
There's too much of you in this town
Your memory is like moss in the trees
Every corner it's just hanging around
Well, The Big Easy ain't so easy
Hard to say it but baby come morning

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm Leaving New Orleans
There's too much of you in this town
Your memory is like moss in the trees
Every quarter is just hanging around
Well, The Big Easy ain't so easy
Hard to say it but baby come morning
I'll be rolling like the Mississippi leaving New Orleans

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm leaving New Orleans
Goodbye New Orleans
Leaving New Orleans
