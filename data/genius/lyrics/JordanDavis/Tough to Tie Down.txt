Title: Tough to Tie Down
Artist: Jordan Davis

[Verse 1]
She's got too much run and too much wild
She don't hold back, no she don't hide
She's always drifting and always dreaming
She's good at loving and better at leaving

[Chorus]
Damn those airplanes and
Damn those fast trains and
Damn those interstates
They always keep calling her
So damn easy for her to leave me
But as long as this world's spinning 'round
I'm gonna love her
Damn she's so tough to tie down
(Tough to tie down)

[Verse 2]
It's who she is so she can't see
That her gypsy side is killing me
And I told myself I should call it quits
But before I can, she's gone again

[Chorus]
Damn those airplanes and
Damn those fast trains and
Damn those interstates
They always keep calling her
So damn easy for her to leave me
But as long as this world's spinning 'round
I'm gonna love her
Damn she's so tough to tie down

[Bridge]
Yeah she knows how to get to me, get to me
Get to me, get to me
Yeah she knows just how to leave, how to leave
She's always leaving me like

[Chorus]
Damn those airplanes and
Damn those fast trains and
Damn those interstates
They always keep calling her
So damn easy for her to leave me
But as long as this world's spinning 'round
I'm gonna love her
Damn she's so tough to tie down

[Outro]
Yeah she's always drifting and always dreaming
She's good at loving but better at leaving
