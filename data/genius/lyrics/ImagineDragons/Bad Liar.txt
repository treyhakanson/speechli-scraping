Title: Bad Liar
Artist: Imagine Dragons

[Verse 1]
Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me darlin'
It’s been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears:
Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

[Pre-Chorus]
So look me in the eyes (Eyes), tell me what you see (You see)
Perfect paradise (—Dise), tearin' at the seams (Seams)
I wish I could escape it (Escape), I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it (Erase), make your heart believe

[Chorus]
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you’re free to go

[Verse 2]
Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I’ve been askin' for—
Oh, I’ve been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war, on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin’ for— (Trust me, darlin')
Oh, I've been askin' for (Trust me, darlin') problems, problems, problems

[Pre-Chorus]
So look me in the eyes (Eyes), tell me what you see (You see)
Perfect paradise (—Dise), tearin' at the seams (Seams)
I wish I could escape it (Escape), I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it (Erase), make your heart believe

[Chorus]
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

[Bridge]
I can't breathe, I can't be
I can't be what you want me to be
Believe me, this one time
Believe me

[Chorus]
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh
Please believe me
Please believe me
