Title: Radioactive
Artist: Imagine Dragons

[Intro]
Whoah-oh
Whoah-oh
Whoah-oh
Whoah

[Verse 1]
I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
I'm breaking in, shaping up then
Checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse – whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Verse 2]
I raise my flags, don my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in – whoa
I'm breaking in, shaping up then
Checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse – whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Bridge]
All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive
