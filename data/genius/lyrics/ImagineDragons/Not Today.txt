Title: Not Today
Artist: Imagine Dragons

[Verse 1]
There she goes in front of me
Take my life and set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road is at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it
We finally fall apart
And we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love
We better start today

[Chorus]
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh, easier and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
But not today, not today

[Verse 2]
There she goes in front of me
Take my life, set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road was at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it
We finally fall apart
And we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love
We better start today

[Chorus]
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh, easier and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier

[Bridge]
So come with me
You'll come with me
So come with me
You'll come with me
Not today
Not today
Not today
Not today

[Chorus]
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh, easier and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today
