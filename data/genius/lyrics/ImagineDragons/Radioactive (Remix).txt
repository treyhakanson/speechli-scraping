Title: Radioactive (Remix)
Artist: Imagine Dragons

[Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]
I'm wakin' up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathin' in the chemicals
I'm breakin' in, shapin' up
The checkin' out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, whoa

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Verse 2: Dan Reynolds]
I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We'll paint it red to fit right in, whoa
I'm breakin' in, shapin' up
The checkin' out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, whoa

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Bridge: Dan Reynolds]
All systems go, sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Bury me alive, bury me with pride
Bury me with berries, that forbidden fruit and cherry wine
Thank you berry much, but tonight's my night and I'm Barry Bonds
Swingin' for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time
Everything in life's subject to change, change whip, change grind
Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind
I don't really know yah business, been in there since I was bendin' Lego blocks
Now you tell the world about me, dry snitch
Tater tots on my shotgun, now I gotta pop one at the stars
Sky's the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, I'ma make my mark, even when they start their Martial Law
Even when these Martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Fuck, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, don't give a fuck and can barely decide
Wishin' good luck on my enemies, all of my energy go to the almighty God
I could drown in a bottle of Hennessy, fuck your amenities, I'm gettin' better with time
AHHHHH!

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Outro: Dan Reynolds]
I'm radioactive, radioactive
