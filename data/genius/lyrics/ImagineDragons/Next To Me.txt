Title: Next To Me
Artist: Imagine Dragons

[Music Film Opening Dialogue]

[Verse 1]
Something about the way that you walked into my living room
Casually and confident lookin' at the mess I am
But still you, still you want me
Stress lines and cigarettes, politics, and deficits
Late bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin'
But still you, still you want me

[Chorus]
Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still, I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me (next to me)

[Verse 2]
There's something about the way that you always see the pretty view
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless
And still you, still you want me
I got no innocence, faith ain't no privilege
I am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts
And still you, still you want me

[Chorus]
Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still, I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me (next to me)

[Bridge]
Oh
So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn't easy
But I hope to be worth it (Oh)
So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn't easy
But I hope to be worth it (Oh)

[Music Film Aja's Revelation]

[Chorus]
Oh, I always let you down (I always let you down)
You're shattered on the ground, (Shattered on the ground)
But still, I find you there (Yeah)
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do (Stupid things I do)
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me (Next to me)
