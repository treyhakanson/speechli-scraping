Title: Don't Want You
Artist: Ella Mai

[Verse 1]
What you talkin’ ‘bout you changed your mind?
Didn’t I treat you right?
Find your way to my heart now you putting on like you don’t
Want to be around, can’t spend much time
Boy you better recognize
Little money in your pocket, now you’re tricking
Talking to me like you’re winning

[Pre-Hook]
I was there when you needed me the most so I’m in my feelings
I’m ashamed of the way I felt and you know it’s killing my pride
Wasting my time, ain’t no surprise
You lost one that’s for real
I guess you learn and you live

[Hook]
Damn, just when I put you on
And I thought we’re getting stronger
Now your heart’s far from home
But it’s cool, I don’t want you no more
You messed up, boy you got that
I’m good, ain’t no comebacks
You did this, I’ma run that
I’m good, it’s cool, I don’t want you no more

[Verse 2]
Ain’t no reason I should compromise
I know too much to fall for your lies
What you take me for
I ain’t nothing like them other bitches
Even though I’ve always sacrificed
I don’t mind moving on this time
'Cause time is money and my interest
Ain’t on you so that’s the difference

[Pre-Hook]
I was there when you needed me the most so I’m in my feelings
I’m ashamed of the way I felt and you know it’s killing my pride
Wasting my time, ain’t no surprise
You lost one that’s for real
I guess you learn and you live

[Hook]
Damn, just when I put you on
And I thought we’re getting stronger
Now your heart’s far from home
But it’s cool, I don’t want you no more
You messed up, boy you got that
I’m good, ain’t no comebacks
You did this, I’ma run that
I’m good, it’s cool, I don’t want you no more

[Verse 3]
You ain’t thinking straight
You a fool, boy you lost one
Sing my love for you
You know what to do
I been all up in your face
Still can’t see I’m the right one
That’s too bad for you
Hurts but that’s the truth
I mean

[Hook]
Damn, just when I put you on
And I thought we’re getting stronger
Now your heart’s far from home
But it’s cool, I don’t want you no more
You messed up, boy you got that
I’m good, ain’t no comebacks
You did this, I’ma run that
I’m good, it’s cool, I don’t want you no more

[Hook]
Damn, just when I put you on
And I thought we’re getting stronger
Now your heart’s far from home
But it’s cool, I don’t want you no more
You messed up, boy you got that
I’m good, ain’t no comebacks
You did this, I’ma run that
I’m good, it’s cool, I don’t want you no more
