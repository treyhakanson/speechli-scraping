Title: Boo’d Up (Remix)
Artist: Ella Mai

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, this the remix
Ella Mai, Quavocito, Chun-Li

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, lemme tell you why you so special
Hood nigga bang the .45 special
Fuckin' wit' him but we never tell the press, though
Dick game on Alakazam, presto
Still a Playboy bunny on Hef, though
So we gotta get the dollar like Creflo
He said that he want respect
I said, "That's dope"
But that goes both ways like DeJ Loaf, uh
Left them other bitches with the stupid face
He said he tryna steal my heart, he got the booster face
I give him time that them other niggas used to waste
He got that, he got that, he got that super bass

[Verse 2: Ella Mai]
Feelings, so deep in my feelings
No, this ain't really like me
Can't control my anxiety
Feeling, like I'm touching the ceiling
When I'm with you I can't breathe
Boy, you do something to me

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai]
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do, yeah yeah
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do

[Chorus: Ella Mai]
Listen to my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum it just won't stop, it go
Ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, it just won't stop, it go

[Verse 3: Quavo, Nicki Minaj, Both]
Let you on my life, get a sneak peek
Listen to my heart go beep-beep
When we boo'd up, she keep me out the street-streets
Hit it back-to-back, make me call her repeat
She lockin' up like it's robotic, yeah
On your body, your body, your body, yeah
I'll let you get the racks out my wallet, yeah
But she so bad she say, "I got it," yeah, ooh
And we always catchin' a vibe, ain’t nobody like you
Ain't nobody like, ain't nobody like you

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai]
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do, yeah yeah
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do

[Chorus: Ella Mai & Quavo]
Listen to my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up (boo'd up)
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up (boo'd up, boo'd up)
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up (boo'd up)
Biddy-da-dum it just won't stop, it go (boo'd up)
Ba-dum, boo'd up (boo'd up)
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up (boo'd up)
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up (boo'd up)
Biddy-da-dum, it just won't stop, it go

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & Quavo]
Hello?
What's happenin'?
Babe, can you come and get me?
I'm outside
