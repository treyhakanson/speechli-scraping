Title: She Don't
Artist: Ella Mai

[Intro: Ella Mai]
Mustard on the beat, ho
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she

[Verse 1: Ella Mai]
Wondering what’s on your mind
Guess you like the simple type
I ain’t stupid, dumb, or blind
Won’t sleep in your bed of lies
Heard you met her in the club
Tryna tell me you were drunk
I can still smell her perfume
Nigga I don’t fuck with you

[Bridge: Ella Mai]
I’ma drink up, I’ma smoke some’
Keep it moving, it was nice to know ya
Boy watch me leave
You ghost to me
Wish you good luck being lonely
I’ma push red every time you phone me
You bout to be
A memory

[Hook: Ella Mai]
Bet she doesn’t touch like me
Sure as hell don’t fuck like me
No comparison, no she don’t, she don’t
Ain’t gon’ whip it up like me
She ain’t got the recipe
No comparison, no she don’t, she don’t
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
You right
Nah she ain’t never gon’ be you, but girl it’s whatever
I done called you fifty 'leven times why you treat a nigga like I was never
Your man
I know I fucked up, I'm only human
And I ain’t beggin’ but I’m gon’ ask
For one more chance
Girl I think we should just

[Bridge: Ella Mai & Ty Dolla $ign]
Drink up, I’ma smoke some’ (Smoke some)
Keep it moving, it was nice to know ya (Oh yeah)
Boy watch me leave (Don't go)
You ghost to me (I don't wanna see you go)
Wish you good luck being lonely
I’ma push red every time you phone me (Oh)
You bout to be
A memory (Oh yeah)

[Hook: Ella Mai & Ty Dolla $ign]
Bet she doesn’t touch like me (Touch like you)
Sure as hell don’t fuck like me (She don't)
No comparison, no she don’t, she don’t (No)
Ain’t gon’ whip it up like me
She ain’t got the recipe (She ain't got the recipe)
No comparison, no she don’t, she don’t
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she

[Verse 3: Ella Mai]
I be up on it, you know she can’t keep up
You know you want this, so why you gon’ keep her
Don’t get the picture, I’ll write it out
Losin’ a real one that held you down
I put the boy on and now he feeling himself
No it ain’t nothing to put you back on the shelf
Too late for sorry so boy back down
I have my issues, but one less now
99 problems but a nigga ain’t one

[Outro: Ella Mai]
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she don’t
Oh no she don’t

Did you really think I wasn't gonna find out?
You must really think I'm stupid
Maybe it's time
