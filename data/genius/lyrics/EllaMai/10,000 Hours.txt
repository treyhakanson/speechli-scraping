Title: 10,000 Hours
Artist: Ella Mai

[Verse 1]
Since the day that I was born
I been looking out for love
But never really quite found the one
They say practice makes perfect
I know I deserve it
Sometimes we should do it for fun

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby wind the clock up, I can't wait
Promise this time won't go to waste
For all we put up now
I won't let your love down
I know we're not too far away
Aye aye

[Chorus]
Why you always take so long to call me?
Know I gotta wake up in the mornin'
You know every second adds up to a minute
Need 10,000 hours
We can be so in love
Don't stop, I'm counting them up
Run the clock, I be counting them up
We can be so in love
You know every second adds up to a minute
Need 10,000 hours
We can be so in love

[Verse 2]
I've been right and I've been wrong
I've been high and I've been low
But this time I know it's for sure
'Cause I'm right where I belong
And we are only getting stronger
Feels good to be down in my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby wind the clock up, I can't wait
Promise this time won't go to waste
For all we put up now
I won't let your love down
I know we're not too far away
Aye aye

[Chorus]
Why you always take so long to call me?
Know I gotta wake up in the mornin'
You know every second adds up to a minute
Need 10,000 hours
We can be so in love
Don't stop, I'm counting them up
Run the clock, I be counting them up
We can be so in love
You know every second adds up to a minute
Need 10,000 hours

[Bridge]
There's no time for us holding out
'Cause this love is profound
Let the clock go around
Let the clock go around
Love is best when built from the ground
To your heart I am bound
Let the clock go around
Let the clock go around

[Chorus]
Why you always take so long to call me?
Know I gotta wake up in the mornin'
You know every second adds up to a minute
Need 10,000 hours
We can be so in love
Don't stop, I'm counting them up
Run the clock, I be counting them up
We can be so in love
You know every second adds up to a minute
Need 10,000 hours
