Title: Shot Clock
Artist: Ella Mai

[Verse 1]
24 seconds, yeah, you better not stop
You got 24 seconds, can you beat the shot clock?
What you waitin' on, lil' daddy? I ain't got that much time
You seem anxious, you seem adamant but you ain't pressed my line
Wondering why, why, why (Oh why)
Know you ain't shy, shy, shy (Oh why)
I'ma say bye, bye, bye, better know I won't think twice (Yeah)
Better let go of your pride (Do-do)
Do it now (Do-do), just do it now (Do-do), oh yeah
(Do-do)

[Pre-Chorus]
When that nigga pull up on me, tell that nigga back, back
Don't you know all of these niggas wish that they could bag that?
I'm just saying, boy, you're playing, you're gon' let it wind down
You got 24 seconds and it's starting right now

[Chorus]
Shot clock
(Don't sleep, don't sleep, you gon' miss your opportunity)
Shot clock
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga, pick up your feet, nigga)
Shot clock
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, you gon' miss your opportunity)
Shot clock
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga, pick up your feet, my nigga)

[Verse 2]
Five years of dating, tired of being patient
What the fuck you're waiting for? Oh, yeah
It's a lot of niggas hating and I don't entertain 'em
But damn, you gotta give me more
(Shhh, I know, I know and I'm really trying, but...)
Oh-ohh, if you don't want it like me
I could think about a hundred things I could be doing right now
Than wasting my time with you, oh (Do-do)
Okay, okay, since you gotta have it your way (Do-do)
I'm have to start that clock on you (Do-do)
We gon' see what's up

[Pre-Chorus]
When that nigga pull up on me, tell that nigga back, back
Don't you know all of these niggas wish that they could bag that?
I'm just saying, boy, you're playing, you're gon' let it wind down (Wind down)
You got 24 seconds and it's starting right now (Right now, yeah-eah)

[Chorus]
Shot clock
(Don't sleep, don't sleep, you gon' miss your opportunity)
Shot clock (Shot clock)
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga, pick up your feet, nigga)
Shot clock
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, you gon' miss your opportunity)
Shot clock, shot clock
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga, pick up your feet, my nigga)
Shot clock

[Bridge]
24 seconds
(Don't sleep, don't sleep, you gon' miss your opportunity)
You got 24 seconds
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga, pick up your feet, nigga)
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, you gon' miss your opportunity)
You gon' miss your opportunity
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga, pick up your feet, my nigga, ayy)
Shot clock

[Outro]
L, Love
Add "-rs" and that's surely what we are
Flip it 'round, add "-ve" and let's see if this goes far
Full of chuckles and cuddles and sometimes, eye puddles
Compose love like we're Mozart
