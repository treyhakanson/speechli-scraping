Title: Naked
Artist: Ella Mai

[Verse 1]
Take away the big shirts, the tattoos, the sweatpants and vans
Okay, I don't wear no makeup, no purse in my hands
My resting bitch face is mistaken for the mean girl
But what if I told you there's nothing I want more in this world

[Chorus]
Than somebody who loves me naked
Someone who never asks for love, but knows how to take it
Are you that somebody who sees a wall and breaks it?
Are you ready to fight just to see what's lost behind my flaws?
Can you love me naked?

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, naked
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, naked
Oh, woah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Might be a bitch in the mornin' so catch me at night time
Some of my friends think I'm moody but I think I'm just fine
I could be pissed but I'll act like I'm not
I really remember when I say I forgot
No matter how hard I try
To run away from love at the end of the night

[Chorus]
I need somebody who loves me naked
Someone who never asks for love but knows how to take it
Are you that somebody who sees a wall and breaks it?
Are you ready to fight just to see what's lost behind my flaws?
Can you love me naked?

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, naked
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, naked

[Bridge]
I need someone who loves me when I wake up
Who thinks I'm beautiful when I'm lookin' fucked up
I want that perfect love, am I askin' too much?
Someone who shoots for the stars
Knowin' I think I'm not even good enough

[Chorus]
I need somebody who loves me naked (Who loves me naked)
Someone who never asks for love but knows how to take it (Knows how to take it)
Are you that somebody who sees a wall and breaks it?
Are you ready to fight just to see what's lost behind my flaws?
Can you love me naked?

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, naked
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, naked
