Artist: Meek Mill

[Intro: Beyoncé]
End, that's what I found out

[Chorus: Ella Mai]
Tell me how you want it, yeah
Call me and I'm on my way
Tell me that you need me, yeah
I'll give it to you night and day
I'm talkin' 'bout Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday Saturday, Sunday
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
All day, 24/7
Yeah, all day, 24/7

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh-huh-uh
Lovin' the shit out you, fuckin' the shit out you
For seven days straight, and now I can't even live without you
And if we ever broke up, I won't have a kid without you
You forever in my heart, I won't forget about you
I be crushin' you on Monday like it's Wednesday
You pressed about that nigga, what your friends say?
Oh, G63 is what your Benz say
I'm so happy you ain't listen to your friends, babe
You can tell me how you want it, how you need it, I don't mind
Need you right here by my side, 'cause out of sight is out of mind
And out of spite you hit decline, but I was hype
I hit your line a few more times than you hit back I'm gon' respond

[Chorus: Ella Mai & Meek Mill]
Tell me how you want it, yeah
Call me and I'm on my way (On my way, on my way, woah)
Tell me that you need me, yeah
I'll give it to you night and day (Night and day, night and day, go)
I'm talkin' 'bout Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday Saturday, Sunday
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
All day, 24/7
Yeah, all day, 24/7

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Uh, yeah
You be throwin' that shit back like it's a Thursday
I be treatin' you like everyday your birthday
Them hoes ain't fuckin' with you on your worst day
I got you on a new level like what Ferg say
When you fell down, I pick you up
Put on your crown, and lift you up
I put a rock all on your finger, so much ice could push a puck
Heard they feelings 'bout you, baby, tell them hoes I wish 'em luck
Talkin' relationship goals, this could be us, yuh
24/7, what's the 411?
When you see me kneel like Kaepernick, call a reverend
See, I got a milli' in a stash for a weddin'
If you ready, let me know, 'cause it's whatever

[Bridge: Ella Mai]
But I know you in the worst way
Yeah, our anniversary
'Bout to suit up on my birthday
'Cause I know they keep you thirsty
Ain't no playin', this is us
Boy, be gentle, ain't no rush
365, you're the only one I trust
No, I can't get enough
And all my ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
Yeah, yeah
I'm talkin' 'bout Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday Saturday

[Chorus: Ella Mai]
Tell me how you want it, yeah
Call me and I'm on my way
Tell me that you need me, yeah
I'll give it to you night and day
I'm talkin' 'bout Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday Saturday, Sunday
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
All day, 24/7
Yeah, all day, 24/7
Oh yeah

[Outro: Beyoncé]
End
What I found out-
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best
