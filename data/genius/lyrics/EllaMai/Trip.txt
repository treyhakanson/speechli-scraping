Artist: Ella Mai

[Intro]
Ooh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I put my feelings on safety
So I don't go shootin' where your heart be
'Cause you take the bullet tryna save me
Then I'm left to deal with makin' you bleed

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's a whole lotta love, ain't tryna waste it
Like we be runnin' a mile to never make it
That's just too bitter for worse, don't wanna taste it
That's just too bitter for worse, don't wanna face it

[Chorus]
But I think that I'm done trippin', I'm trip-trippin'
I've been sippin', that's how I control
This feelin', you keep givin'
You keep on hittin' it, ooh, oh
Maybe it's your love, it's too good to be true
Baby boy, your love, got me trippin' on you
You know your love is big enough, make me trip up on you
Yeah, it's big enough, got me trippin' on you, trip-trippin' on you

[Post-Chorus]
My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (Trippin' on you)
My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (Trippin' on you)

[Verse 2]
Boy, you know we cool when I ain't waitin'
But I act a fool when I don't get it
And I'm steady bruisin' just to save this
But I tripped on your love, now I'm addicted

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's a whole lotta love, ain't tryna waste it
Like we be runnin' a mile to never make it
That's just too bitter for worse, don't wanna taste it
That's just too bitter for worse, don't wanna face it

[Chorus]
But I think that I'm done trippin', I'm trip-trippin'
I've been sippin', that's how I control
This feelin', you keep givin'
You keep on hittin' it, ooh, oh
Maybe it's your love, it's too good to be true
Baby boy, your love, got me trippin' on you
You know your love is big enough, make me trip up on you
Yeah, it's big enough, got me trippin' on you, trip-trippin' on you

[Post-Chorus]
My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (Trippin' on you, trippin' on you)
My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (Trippin' on you, trippin' on you)

[Bridge]
That's some kind of love, baby (Drip, drip)
That's the type of love, make me (Trip, trip, trippin' on you)
It's big enough, make me (Drip, drip)
It's big enough, got me (Trip, trip, trippin' on you)

[Chorus]
I'm done trippin', I'm trip-trippin'
I've been sippin', that's how I control
This feelin', you keep givin'
You keep on hittin' it, ooh, oh
Maybe it's your love, it's too good to be true
Baby boy, your love, got me trippin' on you
You know your love is big enough, make me trip up on you
Yeah, it's big enough, got me trippin' on you, trip-trippin' on you

[Post-Chorus]
My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (My bad, my bad, my bad, trippin' on you, yeah)
My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (Trippin' on you, trippin' on you, baby)
My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (Trippin' on you)
Said I admit I was wrong when I did it
My bad, my bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (Trippin' on you, trippin' on you)

[Outro]
Trippin' on you, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah
