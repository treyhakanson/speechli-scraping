Title: A Thousand Times
Artist: Ella Mai

[Verse 1]
I gave you everything that every man says he wants
I cooked, I cleaned, I ironed your jeans, I was the one
I would listen to you when you sound stupid
Treat you like a winner even when you’re losing
Now you got me feeling like shooting Cupid
'Cause you did me wrong

[Pre-Hook]
So when you come running back from the past you’ll be out of time
Because I’m done with your ass, you know that you is out of line
And if you ever move on to another one that you find
I hope you fall and you break your heart like you broke mine

[Hook]
'Cause baby we’re over
A thousand times over
Ain’t no do-overs
It was nice to know you
But this love is over
A thousand times over
I hope the next girl you love ends up fucking you over
A thousand times over

[Verse 2]
I did say everything that every girl says she needs
I need your heart, I need your time, your loyalty
Can’t believe you caught me out here looking stupid
I’m the one that held you down when you was losing
Now you got me feeling like shooting Cupid
'Cause you did me wrong

[Pre-Hook]
So when you come running back from the past you’ll be out of time
Because I’m done with your ass, you know that you is out of line
And if you ever move on to another one that you find
I hope you fall and you break your heart like you broke mine

[Hook]
'Cause baby we’re over
A thousand times over
Ain’t no do-overs
It was nice to know you
But this love is over
A thousand times over
I hope the next girl you love ends up fucking you over
A thousand times over

[Verse 3]
Can’t believe you’ve done this when you know it’s all I wanted
Said I’m done, I’m done
Early in the morning, got me tossing and turning
Thought you was the one, the one
Even though, I been down since long ago
You been wrong, acting like you on the low
I can’t figure out what it is but I’m through
With you

[Hook]
'Cause baby we’re over
A thousand times over
Ain’t no do-overs
It was nice to know you
But this love is over
A thousand times over
I hope the next girl you love ends up fucking you over
A thousand times over
