Title: Killer Queen
Artist: Queen

[Verse 1]
She keeps a MoÃ«t et Chandon in her pretty cabinet
'Let them eat cake' she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation, you can't decline
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Anytime)
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

[Verse 2]
To avoid complications, she never kept the same address
In conversation, she spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah
(Killer, killer, she's a killer Queen)
Then again incidentally, if you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Drop of a hat she's as willing as playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action, temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's all out to get you

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

[Outro]
Wanna try?
