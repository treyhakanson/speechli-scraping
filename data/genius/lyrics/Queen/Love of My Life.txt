Title: Love of My Life
Artist: Queen

[Verse 1]
Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me

[Pre-Chorus]
Love of my life, can't you see?

[Chorus]
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Verse 2]
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love, you now desert me

[Pre-Chorus]
Love of my life, can't you see?

[Chorus]
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Bridge]
You will remember, when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older, I will be there at your side
To remind you how I still love you (I still love you)

[Chorus]
Back, hurry back, please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Outro]
Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, ooh
