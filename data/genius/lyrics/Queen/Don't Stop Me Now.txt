Title: Don't Stop Me Now
Artist: Queen

[Intro]
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now
Don't stop me
'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time

[Verse 1]
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stopping me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you

[Chorus]
Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call
Don't stop me now, 'cause I'm having a good time
Don't stop me now, yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars on a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I'm a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode!

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

[Bridge]
Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me (Hey, hey, hey!)
Don't stop me, don't stop me, ooh, ooh, ooh (I like it!)
Don't stop me, don't stop me (Have a good time, good time)
Don't stop me, don't stop me, aah
Let loose, honey, all right

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit (Hey!)
Travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call
Don't stop me now, 'cause I'm having a good time
Don't stop me now, yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all

[Outro]
Ah, da da da da
Da da ah ah
Ah da da, ah ah ah
Ah, da da
Ah, da da ah ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
