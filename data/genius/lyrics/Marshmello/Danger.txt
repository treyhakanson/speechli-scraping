Title: Danger
Artist: Migos & Marshmello

[Verse 1: Offset]
Tryna get demons up outta me (demons)
Turn to a beast, eat your arteries (beast)
Deceasing opponents so properly (opponent)
Unleashing the dark side what got to me (dark)
We come to take this shit over (hey)
Foot on the gas, hear the motor (skrrt)
Switchin' my thoughts, I'm bipolar (woo)
I stare in the eyes of a cobra (sss)
Say you want smoke, come get it (come on)
You wanna play dumb, I'm wit' it (wit' it)
I'm about to take over the city (hey)
I came with my committee, gang with it (gang)
Came for the bag and the profit (bag)
Lookin' for the wave when we got it (wave)
Nigga, you ain't scare nobody (boo)
Bop-bop, that's a whole body (bop)

[Pre-Chorus: Quavo]
Cold case, cold-cold case
On the dark side, if you keep cold, it's a cold case
Cold-cold case, cold-cold case
In my right mind, I can ride right 'til I road rage
Cold-cold case, cold case
Skeleton on my left wrist, in that soul place
Cold-cold case, cold-cold case
On my knees, thanking God that he got me through the pain

[Chorus: Quavo]
Danger, danger
I don't fit in, I'm a stranger
Believer, believer
I can take out all the evil
Empowerment to all my people
I can prove to you I'm a leader
Run through the money, no Visa
Forgive me 'cause my life illegal

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Searchin' for the bag and the prize (bag)
On a mission lookin' for them bad guys
Can't run no play over my head, I'm real wise
Look at his eyes, wide, think he traumatized
Take me as a joke, I'ma hang 'em on the rope (rope)
'Cause where I'm from, we don't play like that on nawf side (no)
Better not freeze 'cause we know you're gon' choke (choke)
Talk behind my back but your shots backfired
I know you tried but you never could survive
I see the fear that's in your eyes (eyes)
Run like Forrest, they tryna hide
They criticize in disguise (criticize)
They know I can only tell the truth (truth)
They know all you do is tell lies (lies)
I'm about to take over the city, tell me you just with it
'Cause I know my squad gon' ride (ride)

[Pre-Chorus: Quavo]
Cold case, cold-cold case
On the dark side, if you keep cold, it's a cold case
Cold-cold case, cold-cold case
In my right mind, I can ride right 'til I road rage
Cold-cold case, cold case
Skeleton on my left wrist, in that soul place
Cold-cold case, cold-cold case
On my knees, thanking God that he got me through the pain

[Chorus: Quavo]
Danger, danger
I don't fit in, I'm a stranger
Believer, believer
I can take out all the evil
Empowerment to all my people
I can prove to you I'm a leader
Run through the money, no Visa
Forgive me 'cause my life illegal

[Bridge: Offset]
Come on, say you want smoke come get it (wit' it)
You wanna play dumb, I'm with it (gang, gang, bag)
Lookin' for the wave when we got it (wave)
Bop-bop, that's a whole body (bop)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Danger, danger
I don't fit in, I'm a stranger
Believer, believer
I can take out all the evil
Empowerment to all my people
I can prove to you I'm a leader
Run through the money, no Visa
Forgive me 'cause my life illegal
Danger, danger
I don't fit in, I'm a stranger
Believer, believer
I can take out all the evil
Empowerment to all my people
I can prove to you I'm a leader
Run through the money, no Visa
Forgive me 'cause my life illegal
