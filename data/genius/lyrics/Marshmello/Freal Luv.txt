Title: Freal Luv
Artist: Far East Movement & Marshmello

[Intro: Tinashé]
Freal luv
Freal luv
Freal luv
Freal luv

[Verse 1: Tinashé]
Know no limits to feel the truth
When the world stops spinning
I'll know it's you
Searching all night, like a spotlight
For the one to show
Could it be you? Could it be me?
Only way to know
Freal luv

[Chorus: Tinashé]
I'm all yours, when you really wanna take me there
Don't let me go nowhere
I'd give it all up for you, I swear
Only for real love
That love that keeps me shaking
So real, there's no mistaking
I'd give it all up for you, I swear
Only for real love

[Verse 2: Far East Movement (Kev Nish & Prohgress)]
Lovin that real love, something you feel love
Turning me back to the old me
Ride for my realla, I die for my realla
I give you respect like the OGs
Lockin' me down like the police
We ain't never be lonely
Protectin’ my love like a goalie
You'll be the only one next to me right with the homies
We got that empire mind
Combine n’ steadily rise (that be freal)
Moment of truth of has arrived
Trust that forever you ride (that be freal)
You be the bank on my side
You supervise, let's make a deal
Let's get it sealed, let's make it trill
Let's rule the world, together freal

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashé & Far East Movement]
Freal luv (give me that freal luv, that real love, that chill love)
Freal luv
Freal luv (give me that freal luv, real love, f-freal luv)
Freal luv

[Chorus: Tinashé]
I'm all yours, when you really wanna take me there (r-real luv)
Don't let me go nowhere
I'd give it all up for you, I swear
Only for real love
I'm all yours, when you really wanna take me there
Don't let me go nowhere
I'd give it all up for you, I swear
Only for real love
That love that keeps me shaking
So real, there's no mistaking
I'd give it all up for you, I swear
Only for real love

[Verse 3: Chanyeol]
Love is a high, we feelin’ alive
You lovin’ the size, 이 흐름을 타
I give you more, you feelin’ the flow
You never let none of them bring down the vibe
Hustle to win, we be livin’ in sin
Makin’ us two of a kind
새로운 길, babe we got temples to build
Ain't no haters can step to our grind
We got that empire mind
함께 천천히 올라, (That be freal)
진실이 닿는 순간
느껴봐 눈을 감아, (That be freal)
You be the bank on my side, nothing but dimes
Let’s make a deal
서서히 필, 꿈과 현실
내 손을 잡으면, together freal

[Outro: Tinashé & Far East Movement]
Freal luv (give me that freal luv, that real love, that chill love)
Freal luv
Freal luv (give me that freal luv, real love, real love, real love)
Freal luv
