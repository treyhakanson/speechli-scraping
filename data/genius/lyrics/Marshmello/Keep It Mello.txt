Title: Keep It Mello
Artist: Marshmello

[Verse 1]
Woke up and just felt right
Phone blown like a tailpipe
Today's schedule airtight
I turn a short day into a long night
See you soon if you got the heart
Meet you outside Rennie park
Hurry up if it's gettin' dark
We don't say much and that says a lot
Hopped into that old Benz
Drive through where that road ends
Good times with some old friends
I got just the thing if you so tense
Burn one, let's go do some
She got me stoned as Medusa
Zoned out with a blank stare
I'm lookin' into the future

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold up, ain't nothing gonna hold us
Put the devil to the side
Got an angel on my shoulder
And I'm like hello
It's good to finally let go
I ain't worried 'bout a thing
I just like to keep it mellow

[Chorus]
Yeah I like to keep it mello
I smoke to keep it mello
I drink to keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
I smoke to keep it mello
I drink to keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello

[Verse 2]
It's like 4 am and I'm bored again
When that 40 end
When that dream team all played out and they hit the bench
I just step back, lemme soak it in
I've seen the ups and downs so I get it now, I was born to win
It's my time, 'bout time, my turn, I can't lie
Waiting for that one spark
My one hope to catch fire
I'm fine, I'm high
Light rain through that sunshine
Tryin' to man this old boat
I'm the captain now and it's crunch time
I don't care if I'm gettin' paid
Need the week but I get the day
Wide awake when I need sleep
I'm knee deep but I set the way
Focused on that one mistake, let it free don't let it break
Fuck it all, I'm turning in
My celly's off, the great escape

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold up, ain't nothing gonna hold us
Put the devil to the side
Got an angel on my shoulder
And I'm like hello
It's good to finally let go
I ain't worried 'bout a thing
I just like to keep it mellow

[Chorus]
Yeah I like to keep it mello
I smoke to keep it mello
I drink to keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
I smoke to keep it mello
I drink to keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello

[Chorus]
Yeah I like to keep it mello
I smoke to keep it mello
I drink to keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
I smoke to keep it mello
I drink to keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello

[Outro]
I smoke to keep it mello
I drink to keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
