Title: Alone
Artist: Marshmello

[Verse]
I'm so alone, nothing feels like home
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone, nothing feels like home
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you

[Verse]
I'm so alone, nothing feels like home
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone, nothing feels like home
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
