Oh mama, don't play now baby
Say say say, hey hey now baby

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Tell me, tell me if you love me or not, love me or not, love me or not?
I'll bet the house on you, am I lucky or not, lucky or not, lucky or not?
You gotta tell me if you love me or not, love me or not, love me or not?
Been wishin' for you, am I lucky or not, lucky or not, lucky or not?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Tell me, tell me if you love me or not, love me or not, love me or not?

[Bridge: Adam Levine & SZA]
Aren't we too grown for games?
Aren't we too grown to play around?
Young enough to chase
But old enough to know better
Are we too grown for changin'?
Are we too grown to mess around?
Ooh and I can't wait forever baby
Both of us should know better

[Hook: Adam Levine]
Ooooh, oooh
Been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh
Tryna' do what lovers do (ooh)

Ooh, ooh (ooh)
Tryna' do what lovers do (tryna' do what lovers do,ooh)
Ooooh, oooh
Been wishin' for you (been wishin' for love)
Ooh, ooh
Tryna' do what lovers do (do uhh,ooh)
Ooooh, oooh
Been wishin' for you (tryna' do)
Ooh, ooh
Tryna' do what lovers do (ooh)
