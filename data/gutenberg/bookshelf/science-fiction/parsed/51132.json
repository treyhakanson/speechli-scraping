As you can see, we can't keep him with\nus in his present condition.\n\nAlso, Jack owes us two weeks rent and, since Mrs. Burroughs and I are\nretired, we would appreciate your sending the money. It has been a dry\nyear and our garden has done poorly.\n\nThe only reason we put up with your son in the first place was because\nwe are so hard-pressed.\n\nHe saw the sign on the porch, rang the bell and paid Mrs. Burroughs a\nmonth's rent without even looking at the room. Then he ran out to his\ncar and commenced pulling out suitcases and boxes and dragging them\nupstairs.\n\nAfter the third trip, Mrs. Burroughs saw he was having trouble with\nthe stuff and he looked kind of worn out, so she offered to help.\n\nHe gave her a hard look, as she described it to me when I got home. He\nsaid, \"I don't want anyone touching anything. Please don't interfere.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to interfere,\" my wife told him. \"I only wanted to help.\"\n\n\"I don't want any help,\" he said quietly, but with a wild look in his\neye, and he staggered upstairs with the last of his baggage and locked\nthe door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I got home, Mrs. Burroughs told me she thought I ought to take\na look at the new boarder. I went up, thinking we'd have a little\nchat and straighten things out. I could hear him inside, hammering on\nsomething.\n\nHe didn't hear my first knock or the second. I got sore and nearly\nbanged the door down, at which time he decided to open up.\n\nI charged in, ready to fight a bear. And there was this skinny\nred-headed son of yours glaring at me.\n\n\"That's a lot of hammering you're doing, son,\" I said.\n\n\"That's the only way I can get these boxes open, and don't call me son.\"\n\n\"I don't like to disturb you, Mr. Gretch, but Mrs. Burroughs is a\nlittle upset over the way you acted today. I think you ought to come\ndown for a cup of tea and get acquainted.\"\n\n\"I know I was rude,\" he said, looking a little ashamed, \"but I have\nwaited for years for a chance to get to work on my own, with no\ninterference. I'll come down tomorrow, when I have got my equipment set\nup, and apologize to Mrs. Burroughs then.\"\n\nI asked him what he was working on, but he said he would explain later.\nBefore I got out of the door, he was hammering again. He worked till\nafter midnight.\n\nWe saw Jack at mealtimes for the next few days, but he didn't talk\nmuch. We learned that he was twenty-six, in spite of his looking like a\nboy in his teens, that he thought Prof. Einstein the greatest man ever,\nand that he disliked being called son. Of his experiment, he didn't\nhave much to say then. He saw Mrs. Burroughs was a little nervous about\nhis experimenting in the guest room and he assured her it was not\ndangerous.\n\nBefore the week was out, we started hearing the noises. The first one\nwas like a wire brush going around a barrel. It went _whisk, whisk_.\nThen he rigged up something that went _skaboom_ every few seconds, like\na loud heartbeat. Once in a while, he got in a sound like a creaky\nwell pump, but mostly it was _skaboom_ and _whisk_, which eventually\nsettled down to a steady rhythm, _whiskaboom, whiskaboom_.\n\nIt was kind of pleasant.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNeither of us saw him for two days. The noises kept going on. Mrs.\nBurroughs was alarmed because he did not answer her knock at mealtimes,\nand one morning she charged upstairs and hollered at him through the\ndoor.\n\n\"You stop your nonsense this minute and come down to breakfast!\"\n\n\"I'm not hungry,\" he called back.\n\n\"You open this door!\" she ordered and, by George, he did. \"Your\n_whiskaboom_ or whatever it is will keep till after breakfast.\"\n\nHe sat at the table, but he was a tired boy. He had a cold, his eyelids\nkept batting, and I don't believe he could have lifted his coffee cup.\nHe tried to look awake, and then over he went with his face in the\noatmeal.\n\nMrs. Burroughs ran for the ammonia, but he was out cold, so we wiped\nthe oatmeal off his face and carried him upstairs.\n\nMy wife rubbed Jack's wrists with garlic and put wet towels on his\nface, and presently he came to. He looked wildly about the room at his\nmachinery. It was all there, and strange-looking stuff, too.\n\n\"Please go away,\" he begged. \"I've got work to do.\"\n\nMrs. Burroughs helped him blow his nose. \"There'll be no work for you,\nsonny. Not until you're well. We'll take care of you.\" He didn't seem\nto mind being called sonny.\n\nHe was sick for a week and we tended him like one of our own. We got to\nknow him pretty well. And we also got to know you.\n\nNow, Mr. Gretch, whatever you are doing in your laboratory is your own\nbusiness. You could be making atomic disintegrators, for all Jack told\nus. But he does not like or approve of it and he told us about your\nrunning battle with him to keep him working on your project instead of\nhis own.\n\nJack tried to explain his ideas for harnessing time and what he called\n\"the re-integration principle.\" It was all so much _whiskaboom_ to us,\nso to speak, but he claimed it was for the good of mankind, which was\nfine with us.\n\nBut he said you would not let him work it out because there was less\nmoney in it than in your project, and this is why he had to get away\nand work and worry himself into a collapse.\n\nWhen he got well, Mrs. Burroughs told him, \"From now on, you're going\nto have three meals a day and eight hours sleep, and in between you can\nplay on your _whiskaboom_ all you please.\"\n\nThe _whiskabooming_ became as familiar to us as our own voices.\n\nLast Sunday, Mrs. Burroughs and I came home from church, about noon.\nShe went inside through the front door to fix dinner. I walked around\nthe house to look at the garden. And the moment I walked past the front\nof the house, I got the shock of my life.\n\nThe house disappeared!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was too surprised to stop walking, and a step later I was standing at\nthe back of the house, and it was all there. I took a step back and the\nwhole house vanished again. One more step and I was at the front.\n\nIt looked like a real house in front and in back, but there wasn't any\nin-between. It was like one of those false-front saloons on a movie\nlot, but thinner.\n\nI thought of my wife, who had gone into the kitchen and, for all I\nknew, was as thin as the house, and I went charging in the back door,\nyelling.\n\n\"Are you all right?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm all right,\" she said. \"What's the matter with you?\"\n\nI grabbed her and she was all there, thank heavens. She giggled and\ncalled me an old fool, but I dragged her outside and showed her what\nhad happened to our house.\n\nShe saw it, too, so I knew I didn't have sunstroke, but she couldn't\nunderstand it any better than I.\n\nRight about then, I detected a prominent absence of _whiskabooming_.\n\"Jack!\" I hollered, and we hurried back into the house and upstairs.\n\nWell, Mr. Gretch, it was so pitiful, I can't describe it. He was there,\nbut I never saw a more miserable human being. He was not only thin but\nalso flat, like a cartoon of a man who had been steamrollered. He was\nlying on the bed, holding onto the covers, with no more substance to\nhim than a thin piece of paper. Less.\n\nMrs. Burroughs took one of his shoulders between her thumb and\nforefinger, and I took the other, and we held him up. There was a\nbreeze coming through the window and Jack--well, he waved in the breeze.\n\nWe closed the window and laid him down again and he tried to explain\nwhat had happened. \"Professor Einstein wouldn't have liked this!\" he\nmoaned. \"Something went wrong,\" he cried, shuddering.\n\nHe went on gasping and mumbling, and we gathered that he had hooked up\na circuit the wrong way. \"I didn't harness the fourth--I chopped off\nthe third dimension! Einstein wouldn't have approved!\"\n\nHe was relieved to learn that the damage had been confined to himself\nand the house, so far as we knew. Like the house, Jack had insides, but\nwe don't know where they are. We poured tea down him, and he can eat,\nafter a fashion, but there never is a sign of a lump anywhere.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night, we pinned him to the bed with clothespins so he wouldn't\nblow off the bed. Next morning, we rigged a line and pinned him to it\nso he could sit up.\n\n\"I know what to do,\" he said, \"but I would have to go back to the lab.\nDad would have to let me have his staff and all sorts of equipment. And\nhe won't do it.\"\n\n\"If he thinks more of his money than he does of his own son,\" Mrs.\nBurroughs said, \"then he's an unnatural father.\"\n\nBut Jack made us promise not to get in touch with you.\n\nStill, people are beginning to talk. The man from the electric company\ncouldn't find the meter yesterday, because it is attached to the middle\nof the outside wall and has vanished.\n\nMr. Gretch, we are parents and we feel that you will not hesitate a\nmoment to do whatever is necessary to get Jack back into shape. So,\ndespite our promise, we are sending Jack to you by registered parcel\npost, air mail. He doesn't mind the cardboard mailing tube he is rolled\nup in as he has been sleeping in it, finding it more comfortable than\nbeing pinned to the sheets.\n\nJack is a fine boy, sir, and we hope to hear soon that he is back to\nnormal and doing the work he wants to do.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nW. Burroughs\n\nP.S. When Jack figures out the re-integration principle, we would\nappreciate his fixing our house. We get along as usual, but it makes us\nnervous to live in a house that, strictly speaking, has no insides. W.B.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Whiskaboom, by Alan Arkin\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WHISKABOOM ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51132.txt or 51132.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/1/3/51132/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
