The\n          cholera germ, for instance, asks nothing better than that it\n          be swallowed alive...._\n\n\n                        Illustrated by Douglas\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nWhen I came into the control room the Captain looked up from a set of\ncharts at me. He stood up and gave me a salute and I returned it, not\nmaking a ceremony out of it. \"Half an hour to landing, sir,\" he said.\n\nThat irritated me. It always irritates me. \"I'm not an officer,\" I\nsaid. \"I'm not even an enlisted man.\"\n\nHe nodded, too quickly. \"Yes, Mr. Carboy,\" he said. \"Sorry.\"\n\nI sighed. \"If you want to salute,\" I told him, \"if it makes you\n_happier_ to salute, you go right ahead. But don't call me 'Sir.' That\nwould make me an officer, and I wouldn't like being an officer. I've\nmet too many of them.\"\n\nIt didn't make him angry. He wasn't anything except subservient and\nawed and anxious to please. \"Yes, Mr. Carboy,\" he said.\n\nI searched in my pockets for a cigarette and found a cup of them and\nstuck one into my mouth. The Captain was right there with a light, so\nI took it from him. Then I offered him a cigarette. He thanked me as\nif it had been a full set of Crown Jewels.\n\nWhat difference did it make whether or not he called me \"Sir\"? I was\nstill God to him, and there wasn't much I could do about it.\n\n\"Did you want something, Mr. Carboy?\" he asked me, puffing on the\ncigarette.\n\nI nodded. \"Now that we're getting close,\" I told him, \"I want to know\nas much about the place as possible. I've had a full hypno, but a\nhypno's only as good as the facts in it, and the facts that reach\nEarth may be exaggerated, modified, distorted or even out of date.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Carboy,\" he said eagerly. I wondered if, when he was through\nwith the cigarette, he would keep the butt as a souvenir. He might\neven frame it, I told myself. After all, I'd given it to him, hadn't\nI? The magnificent Mr. Carboy, who almost acts like an ordinary human\nbeing, had actually given a poor, respectful spaceship Captain a\ncigarette.\n\nIt made me want to butt holes in the bulkheads. Not that I hadn't had\ntime to get used to the treatment; every man in my corps gets a full\ndose of awe and respect from the services, from Government officials\nand even from the United Cabinets. The only reason we don't get it\nfrom the man in the street is that the man in the street--unless he\nhappens to be a very special man in a very unusual street--doesn't\nknow the corps exists. Which is a definite relief, by the way; at\nleast, off the job, I'm no more than Ephraim Carboy, citizen.\n\nI took a puff on my cigarette, and the Captain followed suit, very\nrespectfully. I felt like screaming at him but I kept my voice polite.\n\"The war's definitely over, isn't it?\" I said.\n\nHe shrugged. \"That depends, Mr. Carboy,\" he said. \"The armies have\nsurrendered, and the treaty's been signed. That happened even before\nwe left Earth--three or four weeks ago. But whether you could say the\nwar was over ... well, Mr Carboy, that depends.\"\n\n\"Guerrillas,\" I said.\n\nHe nodded. \"Wohlen's a jungle world, mostly,\" he said. \"Sixty per cent\nwater, of course, but outside of that there are a few cities, two\nspaceports, and the rest--eighty or ninety per cent of the land\narea--nothing but jungle. A few roads running from city to city, but\nthat's all.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I said. He was being careful and accurate. I wondered\nwhat he thought I'd do if I caught him in a mistake. Make a magic pass\nand explode him like a bomb, probably. I took in some more smoke,\nwondering whether the Captain thought I had psi powers--which, of\ncourse, I didn't; no need for them in my work--and musing sourly on\nhow long it would take before the job was done and I was on my way\nback home.\n\nThen again, I told myself, there was always the chance of getting\nkilled. And in the mood I found myself, the idea of a peaceful,\nunrespectful death was very pleasant.\n\nFor a second or two, anyhow.\n\n\"The Government holds the cities,\" the Captain was saying, \"and\nessential trade services--spaceports, that sort of thing. But a small\nband of men can last for a long time out there in the wilds.\"\n\n\"Living off the country,\" I said.\n\nHe nodded again. \"Wohlen's nine-nines Earth normals,\" he said. \"But\nyou know that already.\"\n\n\"I know all of this,\" I said. \"I'm just trying to update it a little,\nif I can.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he said. \"Oh, certainly, S ... uh ... Mr. Carboy.\"\n\nI sighed and puffed on the cigarette and waited for him to go on.\nAfter all, what else was there to do?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a wonder, the hypno had been just about accurate. That was\nhelpful; if I'd heard some new and surprising facts from the Captain\nit would have thrown all the other information I had into doubt. Now I\ncould be pretty sure of what I was getting into.\n\nBy the time we landed, the Captain was through and I was running over\nthe main points in my head, for a last-minute check.\n\nWohlen, settled in the eighty-fifth year of the Explosion, had\nestablished a Parliamentary form of government, set up generally along\nthe usual model: bicameral, elective and pretty slow. Trade relations\nwith Earth and with the six other inhabited planets had been set up as\nrapidly as possible, and Wohlen had become a full member of the Comity\nwithin thirty years.\n\nMatters had then rolled along with comparative smoothness for some\ntime. But some sort of explosion was inevitable--it always\nhappens--and, very recently, that nice Parliamentary government had\nblown up in everybody's face.\n\nThe setup seemed to be reminiscent of something, but it was a little\nwhile before I got it: the ancient South American states, in the\npre-Space days, before the United Cabinets managed to unify Earth once\nand for all. There'd been an election on Wohlen and the loser hadn't\nbowed gracefully out of the picture to set up a Loyal Opposition.\nInstead, he'd gone back on his hind legs, accused the winner of all\nsorts of horrible things--some of which, for all I knew, might even be\ntrue--and had declared Wohlen's independence of the Comity. Which\nmeant, in effect, independence from all forms of interplanetary law.\n\nOf course, he had no right to make a proclamation of any sort. But\nhe'd made it, and he was going to get the right to enforce it. That\nwas how William F. Sergeant's army was formed; Sergeant, still making\nproclamations, gathered a good-sized group of men and marched on the\ncapital, New Didymus. The established government countered with and\narmy of its own, and for eight months, neither side could gain a\nreally decisive advantage.\n\nThen the Government forces, rallying after a minor defeat near a place\nknown as Andrew's Farm, defeated an attacking force, captured Sergeant\nand two of his top generals, and just kept going from there. The\ntreaty was signed within eight days.\n\nUnfortunately, some of Sergeant's supporters had been hunters and\nwoodsmen--\n\nOrdinarily, a guerrilla movement, if it doesn't grind to a halt of\nits own accord, can be stopped within a few weeks. Where a world is\nmostly cities, small towns, and so forth, and only a little jungle,\nthe bands can be bottled up and destroyed. And most guerrillas aren't\nvery experienced in their work; a small band of men lost in the woods\ncan't do much damage.\n\nBut a small group of woodsmen, on a planet that consists mostly of\njungle, is another matter. Those men knew the ground, were capable of\nliving off the country with a minimum of effort, and knew just where\nto strike to tie up roads and transportation, halt essential on-planet\nservices and, in general, raise merry hell with a planet's economy.\n\nSo the Wohlen government called Earth and the United Cabinets started\nhunting. Of course they came up with our corps--the troubleshooters,\nthe unorthodox boys, the Holy Idols. And the corps fished around and\ncame up with me.\n\nI didn't really mind: a vacation tends to get boring after a week or\ntwo anyhow. I've got no family ties I care to keep up, and few enough\nclose friends. Most of us are like that; I imagine it's in the nature\nof the job.\n\nIt was a relief to get back into action, even if it meant putting up\nwith the kowtowing I always got.\n\nWhen I stepped out onto the spaceport grounds, as a matter of fact, I\nwas feeling pretty good. It took just ten seconds for that to change.\n\nThe President himself was waiting, as close to the pits as he could\nget. He was a chubby, red-faced little man, and he beamed at me as if\nhe were Santa Claus. \"Mr. Carboy,\" he said in a voice that needed\nroughage badly. \"I'm so glad you're here. I'm sure you'll be able to\ndo something about the situation.\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" I said, feeling foolish. This was no place for a\nconversation--especially not with the head of the Government.\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure you'll succeed,\" he told me brightly. \"After all, Mr.\nCarboy, we've heard of your ... ah ... group. Oh, yes. Your fame is ...\nah ... universal.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"I'll do my best. But the less I'm seen talking to\nyou, the better.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" he said. \"If we need to meet--\"\n\n\"If we do,\" I said, \"there's a set of signals in the daily papers.\nYour Intelligence should know all about that, Mr. President.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" he said. \"Of course. Certainly. Well, Mr. Carboy, I do want to\ntell you how glad I am--\"\n\n\"So am I,\" I said. \"Good-by.\"\n\nThe trouble with the democratic process is that a group of people\npicked at random can elect some silly leaders. That's been happening\never since ancient Greece, I imagine, and it'll go on happening. It\nmay not be fatal, but it's annoying.\n\nMy job, for instance, was to prop up this foolish little man. I had to\nwork against a group of guerrillas who were even more democratic, from\nall I'd heard, and who seemed to have a great deal of common,\nordinary brains. Of course, I wasn't doing it for the President--it\nwas for the Comity as a whole, and it needed to be done.\n\nBut I can't honestly say that that made me feel any better about the\njob.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was driven out of the city right after I'd packed up my\nsupplies--two days' food and water in a rude knapsack, a call-radio\nand some other special devices I didn't think I was going to need.\nBut, I told myself, you never know ... there was even a suicide\ndevice, just in case. I packed it away and forgot about it.\n\nThe city was an oasis in the middle of jungle, with white clean\nbuildings and static-cleaned streets and walks. It didn't seem to have\na park, but, then, it didn't need one. There was plenty of park\noutside.\n\nThe beautiful street became a poor one half a mile out of the city,\nand degenerated into a rough trail for ground vehicles soon after\nthat. \"How many people are there on this planet?\" I asked my driver.\n\nHe never took his eyes from the road. \"Two and a half million, last\ncensus,\" he said, with great respect.\n\nThat explained things, of course. As the population grew, the cities\nwould expand and the forests would go under. It had happened on Earth,\nand on every settled planet. As recently as 1850, for instance, large\ntracts of New York City, where I make my home, were farm and forest;\nwhy, in 1960 the population was only about eight million, and they\nthought the place had reached its height.\n\nWohlen had only begun its drive to citify the planet. Give it another\nhundred and fifty years and the guerrillas couldn't exist, for simple\nlack of any place to hide and to live independently.\n\nUnfortunately, the Government didn't have a hundred and fifty years.\nJudging from what I'd seen, the Government didn't have a hundred and\nfifty days. Rationing was in force at all the markets we'd passed on\nthe way out, and there seemed to be a lot of cops. That's always a bad\nsign; it means normal processes are beginning to break down and\nanarchy is creeping in.\n\nI thought about it. Three months was an outside limit. If I couldn't\nfinish the job in three months, it might as well never be finished.\n\nIt's always nice to have a deadline, I told myself.\n\nThe car stopped at a place in the road that looked like any other\nplace in the road. I got out, adjusted my knapsack and started away\nfrom the road, into the jungle that bordered it. The hypno I'd taken\nhad told me there were farms scattered through the jungle, but I\ndidn't know exactly where, and I didn't even want to find out. The\nknapsack was heavy, but I decided I could stand the weight.\n\nIn five minutes I was surrounded by jungle, without any quick way to\ntell me where the road had been. There was a trail, and maybe human\nbeings had used it, but it was no more than a scratch in the\nvegetation.\n\nThat was green, like Earth's, and mostly spiny. I managed to scratch\nmyself twice and then I learned to duck. After that the time went by\nslowly. I just kept walking, without much of an idea where I was\ngoing. After a couple of hours I was good and lost, which was just\nwhat I wanted. It was starting to get dark, so I took the opportunity\nof building a fire. I dug in my knapsack and found some food and\nstarted to cook it. I was still watching it heat up when I heard the\nnoise behind me.\n\nThose boys were good. He'd sneaked up through the jungle and come\nwithin a foot of me without my hearing him. I jumped up just as if I\nhadn't expected him and whirled around to face him.\n\nHe had his heater out and was covering me with it. I didn't reach for\nanything; I just watched him. He was a big man, almost as tall as I\nwas and solidly built, with a jaw like a bulldog's and tiny, sparkling\neyes. His voice was like rusted iron. \"Relax,\" he told me. \"I'm not\nburning you down, Mister. Not yet.\"\n\nI made myself stare him down. \"Who are you?\" I said.\n\n\"Name don't matter,\" he said without moving the heater an inch.\n\"What's important is, who are _you_? And what are you doing here?\"\n\n\"James Carson's my name,\" I said. \"I'm from Ancarta.\" It was a small\ncity halfway around the planet, a nice, anonymous place to be from.\n\"And I'm minding my own business.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" the big man said. He jerked his head and whistled, one sudden\nsharp note. The clearing was full of men.\n\nThey were all sorts, big and small, thin and fat, dressed in uniforms,\ncast-offs, suits, rags, anything at all. Half of them were carrying\nheaters. The rest had knives, some good and some home-made. They\nwatched me and they watched the big man. Nobody moved.\n\n\"Maybe you're a Government man,\" the big man said, \"and have come out\nto catch some of Bill Sergeant's boys.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\nHe grinned at me as if he hadn't heard me. \"Well,\" he said, \"this\nought to be a big enough batch for you, Mister. Want to capture us all\nright now and take us back to New Didymus with you?\"\n\n\"You've got me wrong,\" I said.\n\nAnother man spoke up. He was older, in his late forties, I thought.\nHis hair was thin and gray but his face was hard. He had a heater\nstrapped to his side, and he wore a good uniform. \"Government men\ndon't come out one at a time, do they, Huey?\" he said.\n\nThe big man shrugged. \"No way to tell,\" he said. \"Maybe Mr. Carson\nhere's got a call-radio for the rest of his boys. Maybe they're all\njust waiting for us, some place nearby.\"\n\n\"If they're waiting,\" the other man said, \"they'd be here by now.\nBesides, Huey, he don't look like a Government man.\"\n\n\"Think they all got tails?\" Huey asked him.\n\nI judged it was about time to put in a word. \"I'm not Government,\" I\nsaid. \"I'm from Ancarta. I'm here to help you--if you're the men I\nthink you are.\"\n\nThat started some more discussion. Huey was all for labeling my offer\na trick and getting rid of me then and there--after which, I suppose,\nhe was going to clear out my mythical followers in the nearby jungle.\nBut he was pretty well all alone; there's got to be a rotten apple in\nthe best-picked barrel and these boys were smart. The only sensible\nthing to do was staring them in the face, and it didn't take them long\nto see it.\n\n\"We'll take you back with us,\" Huey's friend told me. \"When we get to\na safe place we can sit down and talk this out.\"\n\nI wanted to insist on finishing my supper right where I was, but\nthere's such a thing as playing a little too much for the grandstand.\nInstead, I was herded into the center of the group, and we marched off\ninto the jungle.\n\nOnly it wasn't a march; there was no attempt at order. For a while we\nused the trail, and then straggled off it and went single-file through\nmasses of trees and bushes and leaves. Being in the center of the line\nhelped a little but not enough; the spines kept coming through and I\ngot a few more nice scratches. The trip took about half an hour, and\nwhen we stopped we were in front of a cave-mouth.\n\nThe band went inside and I went with them. There was light,\nbattery-powered, and what seemed to be all the comforts of a small,\nill-kept town jail. But it was better than the naked jungle. I was\nstill porting my knapsack, and when we got into the cave I unstrapped\nit and sat down and opened it. The men watched me without making any\nattempt to hide the fact.\n\nThe first thing I took out was an instant-heat food can. It didn't\nlook like a bomb, so nobody did anything. They just kept watching\nwhile I came up with my call-radio.\n\nHuey said: \"What the hell!\" and came for me.\n\nI stood up, spilling the knapsack, and got ready to stand him off; but\nI didn't need to, not then. Three of the others piled on him, like\ndogs on a bear, and held him down. Huey's friend was at my side when I\nturned. \"How come?\" he said. \"Who are you planning on calling?\"\n\n\"I said I wanted to help you,\" I told him. \"I meant it.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he said smoothly. \"Why should I believe it?\"\n\n\"I know the spot you're in, and I--\"\n\nHe didn't give me a chance to finish. \"Now, you wait a minute,\" he\nsaid. \"And don't touch that box. We've got some talking to do.\"\n\n\"Such as?\"\n\n\"Such as how you managed to get here from Ancarta, and why,\" he said.\n\"Such as what all this talk about helping us means, and what the\nradio's for. Lots of talking.\"\n\nI decided it was time to show some more independence. \"I don't talk to\npeople I don't know,\" I said.\n\nHe looked me up and down, taking his time about it. Huey had quieted\ndown some, and our conversation was the main attraction. In the end he\nshrugged. \"I suppose you can't do any harm, not so long as we keep an\neye on that box of yours,\" he said. He gave me his name as if it\ndidn't matter. \"I'm Hollerith,\" he said. \"General Rawlinson\nHollerith.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI gave him the prepared story automatically; it rolled out but I\nwasn't thinking about it. He'd given me my first real surprise; I'd\nthought Hollerith had been killed at Andrew's Farm, and, as far as I\nknew, so did the Government. Instead, here he was, alive and kicking,\ndoing a pretty good job of working with a guerrilla gang. I wondered\nwho Huey would turn out to be, but it didn't seem like the time to\nask.\n\nThe story, of course, was a good one. Naturally it wasn't proof of\nanything, or even susceptible of proof right then and there; it wasn't\nmeant to be. I didn't expect them to buy it sight unseen, but I'd\nplanned it to give me some time until I could start the next step.\n\nJames Carson, I told Hollerith, was a reasonably big wheel around\nAncarta. He wasn't in sympathy with the Government, but he hadn't\nfought in the revolutionary armies or been active in any overt way.\n\n\"Why not?\" he snapped at me.\n\n\"I was more valuable where I stood,\" I said. \"There's a lot that can\nbe done with paper work in the way of sabotage.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"I see,\" he said. \"I see what you mean.\"\n\n\"I worked in one of the Government departments,\" I said. \"That enabled\nme to pass information on to Sergeant's men in the vicinity. It also\ngave me a good spot for mixing up orders and shipments.\"\n\nHe nodded again. \"That's one of the advantages of a guerrilla outfit,\"\nhe said. \"The administration end really doesn't exist; we can live off\nthe country. I should think that, over an area as large as we can\nrange on Wohlen, we can't be wiped out.\"\n\nOf course, that was only his opinion; but I wasn't easy about it. The\nsight of him had shaken me quite a bit and I began to think I'd have\nto get rid of him. That would be unpleasant and dangerous, I told\nmyself. But there didn't seem to be any help for it, at the moment.\n\n\"About information,\" he said. \"You were closely watched--anyone\nworking for the Government would have had to have been. How did you\nget your information out?\"\n\nI nodded toward the radio. \"It's not a normal call-radio,\" I said,\nwith perfect truth. \"Its operation is indetectable by the normal\nmethods. I'm not an expert, so I won't go into technical details; it's\nenough that the radio works.\"\n\n\"Then why come to us?\" Hollerith said. \"Aren't there guerrillas in the\nAncarta vicinity for you to work with?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Only a few more or less ... ah ... disaffected\nminorities,\" I said. That was true, too. \"They raised hell for a day\nor so, then walked in and surrendered. The guerrilla network on the\nentire planet, sir, is under your command.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"It's not my command,\" he said. \"This is a\ndemocracy. You've met Huey ... my orderly, in the old days. But now he\nhas as much voice as I have. Except for expert matters.\"\n\nCrackpots. But I listened. Democracy was the basis of their group;\nevery move was voted on by the entire band, wherever possible. \"We're\nnot a dictatorship,\" Hollerith said. \"We don't intend to become one.\"\n\nIt was nice to hear that; it meant that, maybe, I wouldn't have to get\nrid of him after all. \"Anyway,\" I said, \"your men appear to be the\nonly ones active on Sergeant's behalf.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe took it without flinching. \"Then we need help,\" he said. \"Can you\nprovide it?\"\n\n\"I can get you guns,\" I said. \"Volunteers. Supplies.\"\n\nThere was a little pause.\n\n\"Who do you think you are?\" Hollerith said. \"God?\"\n\nI didn't tell him that, from his point of view, I was inhabiting the\nother half of the theological universe. Somehow, it didn't seem\nnecessary.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe men started to arrive in a week, some of them carrying supplies\nand armaments for all the rest. Hollerith was beside himself with joy,\nand even Huey stopped looking at me with suspicion. In the meantime,\nI'd been living with the guerrillas, eating and sleeping with them,\nbut I hadn't been exactly trusted. There'd been a picked group of men\nset to watch over me at all times, and I managed to get a little\nfriendly with them, but not very. In case I turned out to be a louse,\nnobody wanted to have to shed tears over my unmarked grave.\n\nUntil the men arrived, there weren't any raids; Hollerith, very\nsensibly, wanted to wait for my reinforcements, and he carried most of\nthe group with him. Huey was all for killing me and getting on with\nnormal operations; I don't think he had any real faith in me even\nafter the reinforcements began to arrive.\n\nI'd made the call on my radio, in Hollerith's hearing. I'd asked for\none hundred and fifty men--a force just a bit larger than the entire\nband Hollerith had commanded until then--three hundred heaters with\nammunition and supplies to match, a couple of large guns throwing\nexplosive shells, and some dynamite. I added the dynamite because it\nsounded like the sort of thing guerrillas ought to have, and Hollerith\ndidn't seem to mind. On his instructions, I gave them a safe route to\ncome by, assuming they started near New Didymus; actually, of course,\nsome of my corps brothers were recruiting on other parts of the planet\nand the Government had been fully instructed not to hold any of them\nup. I won't say that President Santa Claus understood what I was\ndoing, but he trusted me. He had faith--which was handy.\n\nHollerith was overjoyed when the reinforcements did arrive. \"Now we\ncan really begin to work,\" he told me. \"Now we can begin to fight\nback in a big way. No more of this sneaking around, doing fiddling\nlittle jobs--\"\n\nHe wanted to start at once. I nearly laughed in his face; it was now\nestablished that I didn't have to get rid of the man. If he'd decided\nto delay on the big attack ... but he hadn't.\n\nSo, of course, I helped him draw up some plans. Good ones, too; the\nbest I could come up with.\n\nThe very best.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The trouble,\" Hollerith told me sadly, a day or so later, \"is going to\nbe convincing the others. They want to do something dramatic--blowing up\nthe planet, most likely.\"\n\nI said I didn't think they planned to go that far, and, anyhow, I had\nan idea that might help. \"You want to take the Army armaments depot\nnear New Didymus,\" I said. \"That would serve as a good show of\nstrength, and weaken any reprisals while we get ready to move again.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he said.\n\n\"Then think of all the fireworks you'll get,\" I said. \"Bombs going\noff, heaters exploding, stacks of arms all going off at once--the\nFourth of July, the Fourteenth, and Guy Fawkes Day, all at once, with\na small touch of Armageddon for flavor. Not to mention the Chinese New\nYear.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Sell it that way,\" I said. \"The drama. The great picture. The\nexcitement. That, believe me, they'll buy.\"\n\nHe frowned while he thought it over. Then the frown turned into a\ngrin. \"By God,\" he said, \"they might.\"\n\nAnd they did. The conference and the election were both pretty stormy.\nAll the new patriots were off to blow up the Government buildings one\nafter another, even more enthusiastic than the original members. It\nwas only natural; my instructions to the recruiters had been to pick\nthe most violent, frothing anti-Government men they could find to send\nout, and that was what we got. But Hollerith gave them a talk, and the\nvote, when it came, was overwhelmingly in favor of his plan.\n\nEven Huey was enthusiastic. He came up to me after the meeting and\npounded me on the back; I suppose it was meant for friendship, though\nit felt more like sabotage. \"Hey, I thought you were no good,\" he\nsaid. \"I thought you were ... oh, you know, some kid of a spy.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, Mister,\" he said, \"believe me, I was wrong.\" He pounded some\nmore. I tried to look as if I liked it or, anyway, as if I could put\nup with it. \"You're O.K., Mister,\" he said. \"You're O.K.\"\n\nSome day, I told myself, I was going to get Huey all to myself, away\nin a dark alley somewhere. There didn't seem to be much chance of\nkeeping the promise, but I made it to myself anyway, and moved away.\n\nThe meeting had set the attack for three days ahead, which was a moral\nvictory for Hollerith; the men were all for making it in the next five\nminutes. But he said he needed time--it's a good thing, I told\nmyself, that he didn't say what he needed it for. Because in a few\nhours, right after sunrise the next morning, training started and\nHollerith had his hands full of trouble.\n\nThe new men didn't see the sense in it. \"Hell,\" one of them\ncomplained, \"all we got to do is go up and toss a bomb into the place.\nWe don't like all this fooling around first.\"\n\nThe \"fooling around\" involved jungle training--how to walk quietly,\nhow to avoid getting slashed by a vine, and so forth. It also involved\nforming two separate attack groups for Hollerith's plans. That meant\ndrilling the groups to move separately, and drilling each group to\nstay together.\n\nAnd there were other details: how to fire a heater from the third rank\nwithout incinerating a comrade in the front rank; signal-spotting, in\ncase of emergency and sudden changes of plan; the use of dynamite, its\ncare and feeding; picking targets--and so forth and so forth.\nHollerith's three days seemed pretty short when you thought about what\nthey had to cover.\n\nBut the new men didn't like it. They wanted action. \"That's what we\nsigned on for,\" they said. \"Not all this drill. Hell, we ain't an\narmy--we're guerrillas.\"\n\nThe older hands, and the more sensible members of the band, tried\ntheir best to talk the new men into line. Some of the officers tried\nordering them into line.\n\nBut the talk was ignored. And as for the officers--well, the old\nUnited States Civil War tried a democratic army for a while, on both\nsides. Unfortunately, electing your officers is not an efficient way\nto run things. The most popular man makes the best officer about as\noften as the most popular man makes the best criminal-law judge. Or\nengineer, for that matter. War's not a democratic business.\n\nThis one, however, seemed to be. Mass election of officers was one of\nthe rules, along with the voting on staff decisions. The new men\nout-numbered the older hands. New officers were elected--and that\nstopped the orders.\n\nHollerith was about two-thirds of the way out of his mind when the\nthree days were up and the attack time came around. When night fell,\nthe atmosphere around the cave was as tense as it could get without\nturning into actual lightning. It was a warm, still night; the single\nmoon was quarter-full but it shed a lot more light than Earth's moon;\nwe blacked ourselves and Hollerith went over the plans. We were still\ndivided into two groups--ragged groups, but groups. The first wave was\nto come around on the depot from the left, attacking in full force\nwith all armaments and some of that dynamite. When things were getting\ntoward a peak in that direction, the second force was to come in from\nthe right and set off its own fireworks. Result (Hollerith hoped):\ndemolition, confusion, catastrophe.\n\nIt was a good plan. Hollerith obviously wasn't sure of his own men\nany more--and neither would I have been, in his spot. But he had the\nadvantage of surprise and superior arms; he was clearly hoping that\nwould overbalance the lack of discipline, training and order in his\nforce. Besides, there was nothing else he could do; he was outvoted,\nall the way down the line.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI set out, with hardly a qualm, along with the second attack group. We\nwere under the command of a shy, tall man with spectacles who didn't\nlook like much, he'd been a trapper before the war, though, and was\none of the original guerrillas, for a wonder, and that meant he was\nprobably a hell of a lot tougher and more knowledgeable than he\nseemed. Setting traps for Wohlen's animals, for instance, was\nemphatically not a job for the puny or the frightened. The first group\nwas under Huey's command.\n\nHollerith stayed with a small group of his own as a \"reserve\";\nactually, he wanted to oversee the battle, and the men were perfectly\nwilling to let him, having gotten one idea into their democratic\nheads: Hollerith was too valuable a man for the guerrillas to lose.\n\nBut I wasn't, of course. I'd done my bit; I'd gotten the volunteers.\nNow I could go and die for glory like the rest of them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe trouble was, I couldn't see any way out. I marched in the dimness\nwith the rest, and we managed to make surprisingly little noise.\nWohlen's animals were active and stirring, anyhow, and that helped.\n\nAt last the depot showed up in the moonlight with the city some\ndistance behind it. There was a wire fence, and a sentry, immediately\nin view behind him were square blocky buildings in a clearing. Beyond\nthat there was another fence, then some more jungle, and then the\ncity. Fifty yards from the fence, in the last screen of trees, we\nstopped and waited.\n\nThe first group was off to the other side of the fence, and I couldn't\nsee or hear them. The wait seemed to go on for hours; perhaps a minute\nand a half passed. Then the first heater went off.\n\nThe sentry whirled and fired without really thinking. There wasn't any\nway for him to tell what he was shooting at. More heaters went off\nfrom the jungle, and then they started to come in. There was a lot of\nnoise.\n\nThe boys were yelling, swarming over the wire fence and through it,\nfiring heaters wildly. There were lights in the buildings, now, and a\npicked group of men came out of one of them, swinging in single file;\nthe heaters chopped them to pieces before they had much of a chance. A\ntower light went on and then the really big guns got going.\n\nThe guerrillas started to get it, then. The big boys from the\narmaments tower charred holes in their line, and the noise got worse;\nmen were screaming and cursing and dying and the heaters were still\ngoing off. I tore my eyes away and looked at the leader of our group.\nHe was poised on the balls of his feet, leaning forward; he stayed\nthat way, his head nodding very slowly up and down, for a full second.\nThen he shouted and lifted an arm and we followed him, a screaming mob\nheading down into hell.\n\nThe big guns were swiveled the other way and for a couple of seconds\nwe had no trouble. Our boys weren't playing with heaters too much;\ninstead, the dynamite started to fly. Light the fuse, pick it up,\nheave--and then stand back and watch. Fireworks. Excitement. Well, it\nwas what they wanted, wasn't it?\n\nThere was an explosion as a small bundle landed inside the fence, in a\ncourtyard. Then another one, the flashes lighting up faces and bodies\nin motion. I found myself screaming with the rest of them.\n\nThen the big one went off.\n\nOne of the dynamite bundles had hit the right spot. Ammunition went\noff with a dull boom that shook the ground, and the light was too\nbright to look into. I went flat and so did the others; I wondered\nabout solid shells exploding and going wild, but there weren't any.\nThe light faded, and then it began to grow again.\n\nI put my head up and saw flames. Then I got up and saw the others\nrising, too. I turned tail for the jungle. Some of them followed me,\nalong with some of the first group; order was lost entirely and we\nwere no more than pieces of a shrieking, delirious, victorious mob. I\nheaded back for the base.\n\nBehind me the ammunition depot burned brightly. The raid was over.\n\nIt had been an unqualified success, of course. The guerrillas had done\nthe best job of their careers.\n\nSo far.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHollerith was back to the cave before me. Put it down to a short-cut,\nor just more practice in the jungle. When I came in he looked\nterrible, about a hundred and twelve years old and shrunken. But my\nappearance seemed to rouse him a little. He gestured and the others in\nthe cave--three or four of them--went out. One stood at the entrance.\n\nThere was a silence. Hollerith grimaced at me. \"You're working for the\nGovernment,\" he said. It wasn't a question.\n\nI shook my head. \"I--\"\n\n\"Keep it,\" he said. \"James Carson from Ancarta is a cover identity,\nthat's all. I tell you, I _know_.\"\n\nHe didn't look ready to pull a heater. I waited a second. The silence\ngot louder. Then I said: \"All right. How do you know?\"\n\nThe grimace again, twisted and half-humorous. \"Why, because you got me\nrecruits,\" he said. \"Because you got me armaments. Because you helped\nme.\"\n\n\"Doesn't make sense,\" I said.\n\n\"Doesn't it?\" He turned away from me for a second. When he turned back\nhe looked more like General Rawlinson Hollerith, and less like a\ncorpse. \"You got me fanatics, men who hated the Government.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"They don't think straight,\" he said. \"There isn't room in their minds\nfor any more than that hatred. And they're democratic, just like the\nrest of us. They vote.\"\n\n\"You set that up,\" I said. \"I had nothing to do with it.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"I know,\" he said. \"There are places where democracy just\ndoesn't work. Like an armed force. As long as most of the members\nthink alike, you're all right. But when a new factor comes into the\npicture--why, nobody knows what he's voting for. It becomes a matter\nof personal preference--which is no way to run a war.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I said. \"But I got you the men and their arms--\"\n\n\"Sure you did,\" he said. \"You got me everything I needed--to hang\nmyself with.\" He raised a hand. \"I'm not saying you worked against me.\nYou didn't have to.\"\n\n\"I got you everything you wanted,\" I said.\n\n\"Sure,\" he said. \"Did you ever hear of jujitsu?\"\n\n\"I--\"\n\n\"You used my strength against me,\" he said. \"You got me what I\nwanted--and did it in such a way that it would ruin me.\"\n\n\"But the attack was a success,\" I said.\n\nHe shook his head. \"How many men are going to come back?\" he said.\n\"Fifty? Sixty? How many of them are going to get lost out there,\nreturn to the city, try to go up against New Didymus with a heater and\nnothing else? How many of them have had all the excitement they want?\nThose are going to head for home. A success--\"\n\nHe paused. I waited.\n\n\"There was a general in Greece in the ancient days,\" he said. \"A\ngeneral named Pyrrhus. He won a battle once, and lost most of his men\ndoing it. 'For my part,' he said, 'another victory like this and we\nare undone.' That's the kind of success we had.\"\n\nHollerith had brains. \"A Pyrrhic victory,\" I said.\n\n\"And you know all about it,\" he said. \"You planned it this way.\"\n\nI shrugged. \"By doing what you wanted done,\" I said.\n\nHe nodded, very slowly.\n\n\"What now?\" I said quietly.\n\nHe acted, for a second, as if he didn't hear me. Then he spoke. \"Now,\"\nhe said, \"we go back. Democracy--it's a limited tool, like anything\nelse. No tool is so good that it can be used in every case, on every\nproblem. We were wrong. We'd better admit it and go back.\"\n\n\"But your men--\"\n\n\"The good ones know the truth now,\" he said, \"just as I do. The others ...\nthere's nothing else they can do, without me and without the rest of the\nforce.\"\n\nI took a deep breath. It was all over.\n\n\"And now,\" he said suddenly, \"I want you to tell me just who you\nare.\"\n\n\"I--\"\n\n\"Not James Carson,\" he said. \"And not from Ancarta. Not even from\nWohlen.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" I said.\n\n\"Nobody on this planet,\" he said, \"would do this job in just this way.\nI'm familiar enough with the top men to be sure of that. You're from\nthe Comity.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" I said.\n\n\"But ... who are you? What force? What army?\"\n\n\"No army,\" I said. \"You might call me a teacher; my corps is made up\nof teachers. We give lessons--where lessons are needed.\"\n\n\"A teacher,\" he said quietly. A long time passed. \"Well,\" he asked,\n\"do I pass the course?\"\n\n\"You pass,\" I told him. \"You pass--with high marks, General.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was off-planet within twenty-four hours. Not that Santa Claus didn't\nwant me to stay longer, when I told him what had happened. Hell, he\nwanted to throw a banquet and sixteen speeches in my honor. I was a\nholy Idol all over again. I was superhuman.\n\nI was glad to get away. What makes them think a man's special, just\nbecause he uses his brain once in a while?\n\nTHE END\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Man Who Played to Lose, by \nLaurence Mark Janifer\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MAN WHO PLAYED TO LOSE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 30259.txt or 30259.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/2/5/30259/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
