It is well\nknown with what energy the military instinct was developed amongst that\nnation of shipowners, shopkeepers, and mechanics. Mere tradesmen jumped\ntheir counters to become extempore captains, colonels, and generals\nwithout having passed the Military School at West Point; they soon\nrivalled their colleagues of the old continent, and, like them, gained\nvictories by dint of lavishing bullets, millions, and men.\n\nBut where Americans singularly surpassed Europeans was in the science of\nballistics, or of throwing massive weapons by the use of an engine; not\nthat their arms attained a higher degree of perfection, but they were of\nunusual dimensions, and consequently of hitherto unknown ranges. The\nEnglish, French, and Prussians have nothing to learn about flank,\nrunning, enfilading, or point-blank firing; but their cannon, howitzers,\nand mortars are mere pocket-pistols compared with the formidable engines\nof American artillery.\n\nThis fact ought to astonish no one. The Yankees, the first mechanicians\nin the world, are born engineers, just as Italians are musicians and\nGermans metaphysicians. Thence nothing more natural than to see them\nbring their audacious ingenuity to bear on the science of ballistics.\nHence those gigantic cannon, much less useful than sewing-machines, but\nquite as astonishing, and much more admired. The marvels of this style\nby Parrott, Dahlgren, and Rodman are well known. There was nothing left\nthe Armstrongs, Pallisers, and Treuille de Beaulieux but to bow before\ntheir transatlantic rivals.\n\nTherefore during the terrible struggle between Northerners and\nSoutherners, artillerymen were in great request; the Union newspapers\npublished their inventions with enthusiasm, and there was no little\ntradesman nor _na\u00eff_ \"booby\" who did not bother his head day and night\nwith calculations about impossible trajectory engines.\n\nNow when an American has an idea he seeks another American to share it.\nIf they are three, they elect a president and two secretaries. Given\nfour, they elect a clerk, and a company is established. Five convoke a\ngeneral meeting, and the club is formed. It thus happened at Baltimore.\nThe first man who invented a new cannon took into partnership the first\nman who cast it and the first man that bored it. Such was the nucleus of\nthe Gun Club. One month after its formation it numbered eighteen hundred\nand thirty-three effective members, and thirty thousand five hundred and\nseventy-five corresponding members.\n\nOne condition was imposed as a _sine qu\u00e2 non_ upon every one who wished\nto become a member--that of having invented, or at least perfected, a\ncannon; or, in default of a cannon, a firearm of some sort. But, to tell\nthe truth, mere inventors of fifteen-barrelled rifles, revolvers, or\nsword-pistols did not enjoy much consideration. Artillerymen were always\npreferred to them in every circumstance.\n\n\"The estimation in which they are held,\" said one day a learned orator\nof the Gun Club, \"is in proportion to the size of their cannon, and in\ndirect ratio to the square of distance attained by their projectiles!\"\n\nA little more and it would have been Newton's law of gravitation applied\nto moral order.\n\nOnce the Gun Club founded, it can be easily imagined its effect upon the\ninventive genius of the Americans. War-engines took colossal\nproportions, and projectiles launched beyond permitted distances cut\ninoffensive pedestrians to pieces. All these inventions left the timid\ninstruments of European artillery far behind them. This may be estimated\nby the following figures:--\n\nFormerly, \"in the good old times,\" a thirty-six pounder, at a distance\nof three hundred feet, would cut up thirty-six horses, attacked in\nflank, and sixty-eight men. The art was then in its infancy.\nProjectiles have since made their way. The Rodman gun that sent a\nprojectile weighing half a ton a distance of seven miles could easily\nhave cut up a hundred and fifty horses and three hundred men. There was\nsome talk at the Gun Club of making a solemn experiment with it. But if\nthe horses consented to play their part, the men unfortunately were\nwanting.\n\nHowever that may be, the effect of these cannon was very deadly, and at\neach discharge the combatants fell like ears before a scythe. After such\nprojectiles what signified the famous ball which, at Coutras, in 1587,\ndisabled twenty-five men; and the one which, at Zorndorff, in 1758,\nkilled forty fantassins; and in 1742, Kesseldorf's Austrian cannon, of\nwhich every shot levelled seventy enemies with the ground? What was the\nastonishing firing at Jena or Austerlitz, which decided the fate of the\nbattle? During the Federal war much more wonderful things had been seen.\nAt the battle of Gettysburg, a conical projectile thrown by a\nrifle-barrel cut up a hundred and seventy-three Confederates, and at the\npassage of the Potomac a Rodman ball sent two hundred and fifteen\nSoutherners into an evidently better world. A formidable mortar must\nalso be mentioned, invented by J.T. Maston, a distinguished member and\nperpetual secretary of the Gun Club, the result of which was far more\ndeadly, seeing that, at its trial shot, it killed three hundred and\nthirty-seven persons--by bursting, it is true.\n\nWhat can be added to these figures, so eloquent in themselves? Nothing.\nSo the following calculation obtained by the statistician Pitcairn will\nbe admitted without contestation: by dividing the number of victims\nfallen under the projectiles by that of the members of the Gun Club, he\nfound that each one of them had killed, on his own account, an average\nof two thousand three hundred and seventy-five men and a fraction.\n\nBy considering such a result it will be seen that the single\npreoccupation of this learned society was the destruction of humanity\nphilanthropically, and the perfecting of firearms considered as\ninstruments of civilisation. It was a company of Exterminating Angels,\nat bottom the best fellows in the world.\n\nIt must be added that these Yankees, brave as they have ever proved\nthemselves, did not confine themselves to formulae, but sacrificed\nthemselves to their theories. Amongst them might be counted officers of\nevery rank, those who had just made their _d\u00e9but_ in the profession of\narms, and those who had grown old on their gun-carriage. Many whose\nnames figured in the book of honour of the Gun Club remained on the\nfield of battle, and of those who came back the greater part bore marks\nof their indisputable valour. Crutches, wooden legs, articulated arms,\nhands with hooks, gutta-percha jaws, silver craniums, platinum noses,\nnothing was wanting to the collection; and the above-mentioned Pitcairn\nlikewise calculated that in the Gun Club there was not quite one arm\namongst every four persons, and only two legs amongst six.\n\nBut these valiant artillerymen paid little heed to such small matters,\nand felt justly proud when the report of a battle stated the number of\nvictims at tenfold the quantity of projectiles expended.\n\nOne day, however, a sad and lamentable day, peace was signed by the\nsurvivors of the war, the noise of firing gradually ceased, the mortars\nwere silent, the howitzers were muzzled for long enough, and the cannon,\nwith muzzles depressed, were stored in the arsenals, the shots were\npiled up in the parks, the bloody reminiscences were effaced, cotton\nshrubs grew magnificently on the well-manured fields, mourning garments\nbegan to be worn-out, as well as sorrow, and the Gun Club had nothing\nwhatever to do.\n\nCertain old hands, inveterate workers, still went on with their\ncalculations in ballistics; they still imagined gigantic bombs and\nunparalleled howitzers. But what was the use of vain theories that could\nnot be put in practice? So the saloons were deserted, the servants slept\nin the antechambers, the newspapers grew mouldy on the tables, from dark\ncorners issued sad snores, and the members of the Gun Club, formerly so\nnoisy, now reduced to silence by the disastrous peace, slept the sleep\nof Platonic artillery!\n\n\"This is distressing,\" said brave Tom Hunter, whilst his wooden legs\nwere carbonising at the fireplace of the smoking-room. \"Nothing to do!\nNothing to look forward to! What a tiresome existence! Where is the time\nwhen cannon awoke you every morning with its joyful reports?\"\n\n\"That time is over,\" answered dandy Bilsby, trying to stretch the arms\nhe had lost. \"There was some fun then! You invented an howitzer, and it\nwas hardly cast before you ran to try it on the enemy; then you went\nback to the camp with an encouragement from Sherman, or a shake of the\nhands from MacClellan! But now the generals have gone back to their\ncounters, and instead of cannon-balls they expedite inoffensive cotton\nbales! Ah, by Saint Barb! the future of artillery is lost to America!\"\n\n\"Yes, Bilsby,\" cried Colonel Blomsberry, \"it is too bad! One fine\nmorning you leave your tranquil occupations, you are drilled in the use\nof arms, you leave Baltimore for the battle-field, you conduct yourself\nlike a hero, and in two years, three years at the latest, you are\nobliged to leave the fruit of so many fatigues, to go to sleep in\ndeplorable idleness, and keep your hands in your pockets.\"\n\nThe valiant colonel would have found it very difficult to give such a\nproof of his want of occupation, though it was not the pockets that were\nwanting.\n\n\"And no war in prospect, then,\" said the famous J.T. Maston, scratching\nhis gutta-percha cranium with his steel hook; \"there is not a cloud on\nthe horizon now that there is so much to do in the science of artillery!\nI myself finished this very morning a diagram with plan, basin, and\nelevation of a mortar destined to change the laws of warfare!\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" replied Tom Hunter, thinking involuntarily of the Honourable\nJ.T. Maston's last essay.\n\n\"Indeed!\" answered Maston. \"But what is the use of the good results of\nsuch studies and so many difficulties conquered? It is mere waste of\ntime. The people of the New World seem determined to live in peace, and\nour bellicose _Tribune_ has gone as far as to predict approaching\ncatastrophes due to the scandalous increase of population!\"\n\n\"Yet, Maston,\" said Colonel Blomsberry, \"they are always fighting in\nEurope to maintain the principle of nationalities!\"\n\n\"What of that?\"\n\n\"Why, there might be something to do over there, and if they accepted\nour services--\"\n\n\"What are you thinking of?\" cried Bilsby. \"Work at ballistics for the\nbenefit of foreigners!\"\n\n\"Perhaps that would be better than not doing it at all,\" answered the\ncolonel.\n\n\"Doubtless,\" said J.T. Maston, \"it would be better, but such an\nexpedient cannot be thought of.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" asked the colonel.\n\n\"Because their ideas of advancement would be contrary to all our\nAmerican customs. Those folks seem to think that you cannot be a\ngeneral-in-chief without having served as second lieutenant, which comes\nto the same as saying that no one can point a gun that has not cast one.\nNow that is simply--\"\n\n\"Absurd!\" replied Tom Hunter, whittling the arms of his chair with his\nbowie-knife; \"and as things are so, there is nothing left for us but to\nplant tobacco or distil whale-oil!\"\n\n\"What!\" shouted J.T. Maston, \"shall we not employ these last years of\nour existence in perfecting firearms? Will not a fresh opportunity\npresent itself to try the ranges of our projectiles? Will the atmosphere\nbe no longer illuminated by the lightning of our cannons? Won't some\ninternational difficulty crop up that will allow us to declare war\nagainst some transatlantic power? Won't France run down one of our\nsteamers, or won't England, in defiance of the rights of nations, hang\nup three or four of our countrymen?\"\n\n\"No, Maston,\" answered Colonel Blomsberry; \"no such luck! No, not one of\nthose incidents will happen; and if one did, it would be of no use to\nus. American sensitiveness is declining daily, and we are going to the\ndogs!\"\n\n\"Yes, we are growing quite humble,\" replied Bilsby.\n\n\"And we are humiliated!\" answered Tom Hunter.\n\n\"All that is only too true,\" replied J.T. Maston, with fresh vehemence.\n\"There are a thousand reasons for fighting floating about, and still we\ndon't fight! We economise legs and arms, and that to the profit of folks\nthat don't know what to do with them. Look here, without looking any\nfarther for a motive for war, did not North America formerly belong to\nthe English?\"\n\n\"Doubtless,\" answered Tom Hunter, angrily poking the fire with the end\nof his crutch.\n\n\"Well,\" replied J.T. Maston, \"why should not England in its turn belong\nto the Americans?\"\n\n\"It would be but justice,\" answered Colonel Blomsberry.\n\n\"Go and propose that to the President of the United States,\" cried J.T.\nMaston, \"and see what sort of a reception you would get.\"\n\n\"It would not be a bad reception,\" murmured Bilsby between the four\nteeth he had saved from battle.\n\n\"I'faith,\" cried J.T. Maston, \"they need not count upon my vote in the\nnext elections.\"\n\n\"Nor upon ours,\" answered with common accord these bellicose invalids.\n\n\"In the meantime,\" continued J.T. Maston, \"and to conclude, if they do\nnot furnish me with the opportunity of trying my new mortar on a real\nbattle-field, I shall send in my resignation as member of the Gun Club,\nand I shall go and bury myself in the backwoods of Arkansas.\"\n\n\"We will follow you there,\" answered the interlocutors of the\nenterprising J.T. Maston.\n\nThings had come to that pass, and the club, getting more excited, was\nmenaced with approaching dissolution, when an unexpected event came to\nprevent so regrettable a catastrophe.\n\nThe very day after the foregoing conversation each member of the club\nreceived a circular couched in these terms:--\n\n\"Baltimore, October 3rd.\n\n\"The president of the Gun Club has the honour to inform his colleagues\nthat at the meeting on the 5th ultimo he will make them a communication\nof an extremely interesting nature. He therefore begs that they, to the\nsuspension of all other business, will attend, in accordance with the\npresent invitation,\n\n\"Their devoted colleague,\n\n\"IMPEY BARBICANE, P.G.C.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nPRESIDENT BARBICANE'S COMMUNICATION.\n\n\nOn the 5th of October, at 8 p.m., a dense crowd pressed into the saloons\nof the Gun Club, 21, Union-square. All the members of the club residing\nat Baltimore had gone on the invitation of their president. The express\nbrought corresponding members by hundreds, and if the meeting-hall had\nnot been so large, the crowd of _savants_ could not have found room in\nit; they overflowed into the neighbouring rooms, down the passages, and\neven into the courtyards; there they ran against the populace who were\npressing against the doors, each trying to get into the front rank, all\neager to learn the important communication of President Barbicane, all\npressing, squeezing, crushing with that liberty of action peculiar to\nthe masses brought up in the idea of self-government.\n\nThat evening any stranger who might have chanced to be in Baltimore\ncould not have obtained a place at any price in the large hall; it was\nexclusively reserved to residing or corresponding members; no one else\nwas admitted; and the city magnates, common councillors, and select men\nwere compelled to mingle with their inferiors in order to catch stray\nnews from the interior.\n\nThe immense hall presented a curious spectacle; it was marvellously\nadapted to the purpose for which it was built. Lofty pillars formed of\ncannon, superposed upon huge mortars as a base, supported the fine\nironwork of the arches--real cast-iron lacework.\n\nTrophies of blunderbusses, matchlocks, arquebuses, carbines, all sorts\nof ancient or modern firearms, were picturesquely enlaced against the\nwalls. The gas, in full flame, came out of a thousand revolvers grouped\nin the form of lustres, whilst candlesticks of pistols, and candelabra\nmade of guns done up in sheaves, completed this display of light. Models\nof cannons, specimens of bronze, targets spotted with shot-marks,\nplaques broken by the shock of the Gun Club, balls, assortments of\nrammers and sponges, chaplets of shells, necklaces of projectiles,\ngarlands of howitzers--in a word, all the tools of the artilleryman\nsurprised the eyes by their wonderful arrangement, and induced a belief\nthat their real purpose was more ornamental than deadly.\n\nIn the place of honour was seen, covered by a splendid glass case, a\npiece of breech, broken and twisted under the effort of the powder--a\nprecious fragment of J.T. Maston's cannon.\n\nAt the extremity of the hall the president, assisted by four\nsecretaries, occupied a wide platform. His chair, placed on a carved\ngun-carriage, was modelled upon the powerful proportions of a 32-inch\nmortar; it was pointed at an angle of 90 degs., and hung upon trunnions\nso that the president could use it as a rocking-chair, very agreeable in\ngreat heat. Upon the desk, a huge iron plate, supported upon six\ncarronades, stood a very tasteful inkstand, made of a beautifully-chased\nSpanish piece, and a report-bell, which, when required, went off like a\nrevolver. During the vehement discussions this new sort of bell scarcely\nsufficed to cover the voices of this legion of excited artillerymen.\n\nIn front of the desk, benches, arranged in zigzags, like the\ncircumvallations of intrenchment, formed a succession of bastions and\ncurtains where the members of the Gun Club took their seats; and that\nevening, it may be said, there were plenty on the ramparts. The\npresident was sufficiently known for all to be assured that he would not\nhave called together his colleagues without a very great motive.\n\nImpey Barbicane was a man of forty, calm, cold, austere, of a singularly\nserious and concentrated mind, as exact as a chronometer, of an\nimperturbable temperament and immovable character; not very chivalrous,\nyet adventurous, and always bringing practical ideas to bear on the\nwildest enterprises; an essential New-Englander, a Northern colonist,\nthe descendant of those Roundheads so fatal to the Stuarts, and the\nimplacable enemy of the Southern gentlemen, the ancient cavaliers of the\nmother country--in a word, a Yankee cast in a single mould.\n\nBarbicane had made a great fortune as a timber-merchant; named director\nof artillery during the war, he showed himself fertile in inventions;\nenterprising in his ideas, he contributed powerfully to the progress of\nballistics, gave an immense impetus to experimental researches.\n\nHe was a person of average height, having, by a rare exception in the\nGun Club, all his limbs intact. His strongly-marked features seemed to\nbe drawn by square and rule, and if it be true that in order to guess\nthe instincts of a man one must look at his profile, Barbicane seen\nthus offered the most certain indications of energy, audacity, and\n_sang-froid_.\n\nAt that moment he remained motionless in his chair, mute, absorbed, with\nan inward look sheltered under his tall hat, a cylinder of black silk,\nwhich seems screwed down upon the skull of American men.\n\nHis colleagues talked noisily around him without disturbing him; they\nquestioned one another, launched into the field of suppositions,\nexamined their president, and tried, but in vain, to make out the _x_ of\nhis imperturbable physiognomy.\n\nJust as eight o'clock struck from the fulminating clock of the large\nhall, Barbicane, as if moved by a spring, jumped up; a general silence\nensued, and the orator, in a slightly emphatic tone, spoke as follows:--\n\n\"Brave colleagues,--It is some time since an unfruitful peace plunged\nthe members of the Gun Club into deplorable inactivity. After a period\nof some years, so full of incidents, we have been obliged to abandon our\nworks and stop short on the road of progress. I do not fear to proclaim\naloud that any war which would put arms in our hands again would be\nwelcome--\"\n\n\"Yes, war!\" cried impetuous J.T. Maston.\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" was heard on every side.\n\n\"But war,\" said Barbicane, \"war is impossible under actual\ncircumstances, and, whatever my honourable interrupter may hope, long\nyears will elapse before our cannons thunder on a field of battle. We\nmust, therefore, make up our minds to it, and seek in another order of\nideas food for the activity by which we are devoured.\"\n\nThe assembly felt that its president was coming to the delicate point;\nit redoubled its attention.\n\n\"A few months ago, my brave colleagues,\" continued Barbicane, \"I asked\nmyself if, whilst still remaining in our speciality, we could not\nundertake some grand experiment worthy of the nineteenth century, and if\nthe progress of ballistics would not allow us to execute it with\nsuccess. I have therefore sought, worked, calculated, and the conviction\nhas resulted from my studies that we must succeed in an enterprise that\nwould seem impracticable in any other country. This project, elaborated\nat length, will form the subject of my communication; it is worthy of\nyou, worthy of the Gun Club's past history, and cannot fail to make a\nnoise in the world!\"\n\n\"Much noise?\" cried a passionate artilleryman.\n\n\"Much noise in the true sense of the word,\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"Don't interrupt!\" repeated several voices.\n\n\"I therefore beg of you, my brave colleagues,\" resumed the president,\n\"to grant me all your attention.\"\n\nA shudder ran through the assembly. Barbicane, having with a rapid\ngesture firmly fixed his hat on his head, continued his speech in a calm\ntone:--\n\n\"There is not one of you, brave colleagues, who has not seen the moon,\nor, at least, heard of It. Do not be astonished if I wish to speak to\nyou about the Queen of Night. It is, perhaps, our lot to be the\nColumbuses of this unknown world. Understand me, and second me as much\nas you can, I will lead you to its conquest, and its name shall be\njoined to those of the thirty-six States that form the grand country of\nthe Union!\"\n\n\"Hurrah for the moon!\" cried the Gun Club with one voice.\n\n\"The moon has been much studied,\" resumed Barbicane; \"its mass, density,\nweight, volume, constitution, movements, distance, the part it plays in\nthe solar world, are all perfectly determined; selenographic maps have\nbeen drawn with a perfection that equals, if it does not surpass, those\nof terrestrial maps; photography has given to our satellite proofs of\nincomparable beauty--in a word, all that the sciences of mathematics,\nastronomy, geology, and optics can teach is known about the moon; but\nuntil now no direct communication with it has ever been established.\"\n\nA violent movement of interest and surprise welcomed this sentence of\nthe orator.\n\n\"Allow me,\" he resumed, \"to recall to you in few words how certain\nardent minds, embarked upon imaginary journeys, pretended to have\npenetrated the secrets of our satellite. In the seventeenth century a\ncertain David Fabricius boasted of having seen the inhabitants of the\nmoon with his own eyes. In 1649 a Frenchman, Jean Baudoin, published his\n_Journey to the Moon by Dominique Gonzales, Spanish Adventurer_. At the\nsame epoch Cyrano de Bergerac published the celebrated expedition that\nhad so much success in France. Later on, another Frenchman (that nation\ntook a great deal of notice of the moon), named Fontenelle, wrote his\n_Plurality of Worlds_, a masterpiece of his time; but science in its\nprogress crushes even masterpieces! About 1835, a pamphlet, translated\nfrom the _New York American_, related that Sir John Herschel, sent to\nthe Cape of Good Hope, there to make astronomical observations, had, by\nmeans of a telescope, perfected by interior lighting, brought the moon\nto within a distance of eighty yards. Then he distinctly perceived\ncaverns in which lived hippopotami, green mountains with golden borders,\nsheep with ivory horns, white deer, and inhabitants with membraneous\nwings like those of bats. This treatise, the work of an American named\nLocke, had a very great success. But it was soon found out that it was a\nscientific mystification, and Frenchmen were the first to laugh at it.\"\n\n\"Laugh at an American!\" cried J.T. Maston; \"but that's a _casus belli_!\"\n\n\"Be comforted, my worthy friend; before Frenchmen laughed they were\ncompletely taken in by our countryman. To terminate this rapid history,\nI may add that a certain Hans Pfaal, of Rotterdam, went up in a balloon\nfilled with a gas made from azote, thirty-seven times lighter than\nhydrogen, and reached the moon after a journey of nineteen days. This\njourney, like the preceding attempts, was purely imaginary, but it was\nthe work of a popular American writer of a strange and contemplative\ngenius. I have named Edgar Poe!\"\n\n\"Hurrah for Edgar Poe!\" cried the assembly, electrified by the words of\nthe president.\n\n\"I have now come to an end of these attempts which I may call purely\nliterary, and quite insufficient to establish any serious communications\nwith the Queen of Night. However, I ought to add that some practical\nminds tried to put themselves into serious communication with her. Some\nyears ago a German mathematician proposed to send a commission of\n_savants_ to the steppes of Siberia. There, on the vast plains, immense\ngeometrical figures were to be traced by means of luminous reflectors;\namongst others, the square of the hypothenuse, vulgarly called the\n'Ass's Bridge.' 'Any intelligent being,' said the mathematician, 'ought\nto understand the scientific destination of that figure. The Selenites\n(inhabitants of the moon), if they exist, will answer by a similar\nfigure, and, communication once established, it will be easy to create\nan alphabet that will allow us to hold converse with the inhabitants of\nthe moon.' Thus spoke the German mathematician, but his project was not\nput into execution, and until now no direct communication has existed\nbetween the earth and her satellite. But it was reserved to the\npractical genius of Americans to put itself into communication with the\nsidereal world. The means of doing so are simple, easy, certain,\nunfailing, and will make the subject of my proposition.\"\n\nA hubbub and tempest of exclamations welcomed these words. There was not\none of the audience who was not dominated and carried away by the words\nof the orator.\n\n\"Hear, hear! Silence!\" was heard on all sides.\n\nWhen the agitation was calmed down Barbicane resumed, in a graver tone,\nhis interrupted speech.\n\n\"You know,\" said he, \"what progress the science of ballistics has made\nduring the last few years, and to what degree of perfection firearms\nwould have been brought if the war had gone on. You are not ignorant in\ngeneral that the power of resistance of cannons and the expansive force\nof powder are unlimited. Well, starting from that principle, I asked\nmyself if, by means of sufficient apparatus, established under\ndetermined conditions of resistance, it would not be possible to send a\ncannon-ball to the moon!\"\n\nAt these words an \"Oh!\" of stupefaction escaped from a thousand panting\nbreasts; then occurred a moment of silence, like the profound calm that\nprecedes thunder. In fact, the thunder came, but a thunder of applause,\ncries, and clamour which made the meeting-hall shake again. The\npresident tried to speak; he could not. It was only at the end of ten\nminutes that he succeeded in making himself heard.\n\n\"Let me finish,\" he resumed coldly. \"I have looked at the question in\nall its aspects, and from my indisputable calculations it results that\nany projectile, hurled at an initial speed of twelve thousand yards a\nsecond, and directed at the moon, must necessarily reach her. I have,\ntherefore, the honour of proposing to you, my worthy colleagues, the\nattempting of this little experiment.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nEFFECT OF PRESIDENT BARBICANE'S COMMUNICATION.\n\n\nIt is impossible to depict the effect produced by the last words of the\nhonourable president. What cries! what vociferations! What a succession\nof groans, hurrahs, cheers, and all the onomatopoeia of which the\nAmerican language is so full. It was an indescribable hubbub and\ndisorder. Mouths, hands, and feet made as much noise as they could. All\nthe weapons in this artillery museum going off at once would not have\nmore violently agitated the waves of sound. That is not surprising;\nthere are cannoneers nearly as noisy as their cannons.\n\nBarbicane remained calm amidst these enthusiastic clamours; perhaps he\nagain wished to address some words to his colleagues, for his gestures\nasked for silence, and his fulminating bell exhausted itself in violent\ndetonations; it was not even heard. He was soon dragged from his chair,\ncarried in triumph, and from the hands of his faithful comrades he\npassed into those of the no less excited crowd.\n\nNothing can astonish an American. It has often been repeated that the\nword \"impossible\" is not French; the wrong dictionary must have been\ntaken by mistake. In America everything is easy, everything is simple,\nand as to mechanical difficulties, they are dead before they are born.\nBetween the Barbicane project and its realisation not one true Yankee\nwould have allowed himself to see even the appearance of a difficulty.\nAs soon said as done.\n\nThe triumphant march of the president was prolonged during the evening.\nA veritable torchlight procession--Irish, Germans, Frenchmen,\nScotchmen--all the heterogeneous individuals that compose the population\nof Maryland--shouted in their maternal tongue, and the cheering was\nunanimous.\n\nPrecisely as if she knew it was all about her, the moon shone out then\nwith serene magnificence, eclipsing other lights with her intense\nirradiation. All the Yankees directed their eyes towards the shining\ndisc; some saluted her with their hands, others called her by the\nsweetest names; between eight o'clock and midnight an optician in\nJones-Fall-street made a fortune by selling field-glasses. The Queen of\nNight was looked at through them like a lady of high life. The Americans\nacted in regard to her with the freedom of proprietors. It seemed as if\nthe blonde Phoebe belonged to these enterprising conquerors and already\nformed part of the Union territory. And yet the only question was that\nof sending a projectile--a rather brutal way of entering into\ncommunication even with a satellite, but much in vogue amongst civilised\nnations.\n\nMidnight had just struck, and the enthusiasm did not diminish; it was\nkept up in equal doses in all classes of the population; magistrates,\n_savants_, merchants, tradesmen, street-porters, intelligent as well as\n\"green\" men were moved even in their most delicate fibres. It was a\nnational enterprise; the high town, low town, the quays bathed by the\nwaters of the Patapsco, the ships, imprisoned in their docks, overflowed\nwith crowds intoxicated with joy, gin, and whisky; everybody talked,\nargued, perorated, disputed, approved, and applauded, from the gentleman\ncomfortably stretched on the bar-room couch before his glass of\n\"sherry-cobbler\" to the waterman who got drunk upon \"knock-me-down\" in\nthe dark taverns of Fell's Point.\n\nHowever, about 2 a.m. the emotion became calmer. President Barbicane\nsucceeded in getting home almost knocked to pieces. A Hercules could not\nhave resisted such enthusiasm. The crowd gradually abandoned the squares\nand streets. The four railroads of Ohio, Susquehanna, Philadelphia, and\nWashington, which converge at Baltimore, took the heterogeneous\npopulation to the four corners of the United States, and the town\nreposed in a relative tranquillity.\n\nIt would be an error to believe that during this memorable evening\nBaltimore alone was agitated. The large towns of the Union, New York,\nBoston, Albany, Washington, Richmond, New Orleans, Charlestown, La\nMobile of Texas, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Florida, all shared in the\ndelirium. The thirty thousand correspondents of the Gun Club were\nacquainted with their president's letter, and awaited with equal\nimpatience the famous communication of the 5th of October. The same\nevening as the orator uttered his speech it ran along the telegraph\nwires, across the states of the Union, with a speed of 348,447 miles a\nsecond. It may, therefore, be said with absolute certainty that at the\nsame moment the United States of America, ten times as large as France,\ncheered with a single voice, and twenty-five millions of hearts, swollen\nwith pride, beat with the same pulsation.\n\nThe next day five hundred daily, weekly, monthly, or bi-monthly\nnewspapers took up the question; they examined it under its different\naspects--physical, meteorological, economical, or moral, from a\npolitical or social point of view. They debated whether the moon was a\nfinished world, or if she was not still undergoing transformation. Did\nshe resemble the earth in the time when the atmosphere did not yet\nexist? What kind of spectacle would her hidden hemisphere present to our\nterrestrial spheroid? Granting that the question at present was simply\nabout sending a projectile to the Queen of Night, every one saw in that\nthe starting-point of a series of experiments; all hoped that one day\nAmerica would penetrate the last secrets of the mysterious orb, and some\neven seemed to fear that her conquest would disturb the balance of power\nin Europe.\n\nThe project once under discussion, not one of the papers suggested a\ndoubt of its realisation; all the papers, treatises, bulletins, and\nmagazines published by scientific, literary, or religious societies\nenlarged upon its advantages, and the \"Natural History Society\" of\nBoston, the \"Science and Art Society\" of Albany, the \"Geographical and\nStatistical Society\" of New York, the \"American Philosophical Society\"\nof Philadelphia, and the \"Smithsonian Institution\" of Washington sent in\na thousand letters their congratulations to the Gun Club, with immediate\noffers of service and money.\n\nIt may be said that no proposition ever had so many adherents; there was\nno question of hesitations, doubts, or anxieties. As to the jokes,\ncaricatures, and comic songs that would have welcomed in Europe, and,\nabove all, in France, the idea of sending a projectile to the moon, they\nwould have been turned against their author; all the \"life-preservers\"\nin the world would have been powerless to guarantee him against the\ngeneral indignation. There are things that are not to be laughed at in\nthe New World.\n\nImpey Barbicane became from that day one of the greatest citizens of the\nUnited States, something like a Washington of science, and one fact\namongst several will serve to show the sudden homage which was paid by a\nnation to one man.\n\nSome days after the famous meeting of the Gun Club the manager of an\nEnglish company announced at the Baltimore Theatre a representation of\n_Much Ado About Nothing_, but the population of the town, seeing in the\ntitle a damaging allusion to the projects of President Barbicane,\ninvaded the theatre, broke the seats, and forced the unfortunate manager\nto change the play. Like a sensible man, the manager, bowing to public\nopinion, replaced the offending comedy by _As You Like It_, and for\nseveral weeks he had fabulous houses.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nANSWER FROM THE CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY.\n\n\nIn the meantime Barbicane did not lose an instant amidst the enthusiasm\nof which he was the object. His first care was to call together his\ncolleagues in the board-room of the Gun Club. There, after a debate,\nthey agreed to consult astronomers about the astronomical part of their\nenterprise. Their answer once known, they would then discuss the\nmechanical means, and nothing would be neglected to assure the success\nof their great experiment.\n\nA note in precise terms, containing special questions, was drawn up and\naddressed to the observatory of Cambridge in Massachusetts. This town,\nwhere the first University of the United States was founded, is justly\ncelebrated for its astronomical staff. There are assembled the greatest\nmen of science; there is the powerful telescope which enabled Bond to\nresolve the nebula of Andromeda and Clarke to discover the satellite of\nSirius. This celebrated institution was, therefore, worthy in every way\nof the confidence of the Gun Club.\n\nAfter two days the answer, impatiently awaited, reached the hands of\nPresident Barbicane.\n\nIt ran as follows:--\n\n\"_The Director of the Cambridge Observatory to the President of the Gun\nClub at Baltimore_.\n\n\"On the receipt of your favour of the 6th inst., addressed to the\nObservatory of Cambridge in the name of the members of the Baltimore\nGun Club, we immediately called a meeting of our staff, who have deemed\nit expedient to answer as follows:--\n\n\"The questions proposed to it were these:--\n\n\"'1. Is it possible to send a projectile to the moon?\n\n\"'2. What is the exact distance that separates the earth and her\nsatellite?\n\n\"'3. What would be the duration of the projectile's transit to which a\nsufficient initial speed had been given, and consequently at what moment\nshould it be hurled so as to reach the moon at a particular point?\n\n\"'4. At what moment would the moon present the most favourable position\nfor being reached by the projectile?\n\n\"'5. What point in the heavens ought the cannon, destined to hurl the\nprojectile, be aimed at?\n\n\"'6. What place in the heavens will the moon occupy at the moment when\nthe projectile will start?'\n\n\"Regarding question No. 1, 'Is it possible to send a projectile to the\nmoon?'\n\n\"Yes, it is possible to send a projectile to the moon if it is given an\ninitial velocity of 1,200 yards a second. Calculations prove that this\nspeed is sufficient. In proportion to the distance from the earth the\nforce of gravitation diminishes in an inverse ratio to the square of the\ndistance--that is to say, that for a distance three times greater that\nforce is nine times less. In consequence, the weight of the projectile\nwill decrease rapidly, and will end by being completely annulled at the\nmoment when the attraction of the moon will be equal to that of the\nearth--that is to say, at the 47/52 of the distance. At that moment the\nprojectile will have no weight at all, and if it clears that point it\nwill fall on to the moon only by the effect of lunar gravitation. The\ntheoretic possibility of the experiment is, therefore, quite\ndemonstrated; as to its success, that depends solely in the power of the\nengine employed.\n\n\"Regarding question No. 2, 'What is the exact distance that separates\nthe earth from her satellite?'\n\n\"The moon does not describe a circle round the earth, but an ellipse, of\nwhich our earth occupies one of the foci; the consequence is, therefore,\nthat at certain times it approaches nearer to, and at others recedes\nfarther from, the earth, or, in astronomical language, it has its apogee\nand its perigee. At its apogee the moon is at 247,552 miles from the\nearth, and at its perigee at 218,657 miles only, which makes a\ndifference of 28,895, or more than a ninth of the distance. The perigee\ndistance is, therefore, the one that should give us the basis of all\ncalculations.\n\n\"Regarding question No. 3, 'What would be the duration of the\nprojectile's transit to which a sufficient initial speed has been given,\nand consequently at what moment should it be hurled so as to reach the\nmoon at a particular point?'\n\n\"If the projectile kept indefinitely the initial speed of 12,000 yards a\nsecond, it would only take about nine hours to reach its destination;\nbut as that initial velocity will go on decreasing, it will happen,\neverything calculated upon, that the projectile will take 300,000\nseconds, or 83 hours and 20 minutes, to reach the point where the\nterrestrial and lunar gravitations are equal, and from that point it\nwill fall upon the moon in 50,000 seconds, or 13 hours, 53 minutes, and\n20 seconds. It must, therefore, be hurled 97 hours, 13 minutes, and 20\nseconds before the arrival of the moon at the point aimed at.\n\n\"Regarding question No. 4, 'At what moment would the moon present the\nmost favourable position for being reached by the projectile?'\n\n\"According to what has been said above the epoch of the moon's perigee\nmust first be chosen, and at the moment when she will be crossing her\nzenith, which will still further diminish the entire distance by a\nlength equal to the terrestrial radius--i.e., 3,919 miles; consequently,\nthe passage to be accomplished will be 214,976 miles. But the moon is\nnot always at her zenith when she reaches her perigee, which is once a\nmonth. She is only under the two conditions simultaneously at long\nintervals of time. This coincidence of perigee and zenith must be waited\nfor. It happens fortunately that on December 4th of next year the moon\nwill offer these two conditions; at midnight she will be at her perigee\nand her zenith--that is to say, at her shortest distance from the earth\nand at her zenith at the same time.\n\n\"Regarding question No. 5, 'At what point in the heavens ought the\ncannon destined to hurl the projectile be aimed?'\n\n\"The preceding observations being admitted, the cannon ought to be aimed\nat the zenith of the place (the zenith is the spot situated vertically\nabove the head of a spectator), so that its range will be perpendicular\nto the plane of the horizon, and the projectile will pass the soonest\nbeyond the range of terrestrial gravitation. But for the moon to reach\nthe zenith of a place that place must not exceed in latitude the\ndeclination of the luminary--in other words, it must be comprised\nbetween 0\u00b0 and 28\u00b0 of north or south latitude. In any other place the\nrange must necessarily be oblique, which would seriously affect the\nsuccess of the experiment.\n\n\"Regarding question No. 6, 'What place will the moon occupy In the\nheavens at the moment of the projectile's departure?'\n\n\"At the moment when the projectile is hurled into space, the moon, which\ntravels forward 13\u00b0 10' 35\" each day, will be four times as distant from\nher zenith point--i.e., by 52\u00b0 42' 20\", a space which corresponds to the\ndistance she will travel during the transit of the projectile. But as\nthe deviation which the rotatory movement of the earth will impart to\nthe shock must also be taken into account, and as the projectile cannot\nreach the moon until after a deviation equal to sixteen radii of the\nearth, which, calculated upon the moon's orbit, is equal to about 11\u00b0,\nit is necessary to add these 11\u00b0 to those caused by the\nalready-mentioned delay of the moon, or, in round numbers, 64\u00b0. Thus, at\nthe moment of firing, the visual radius applied to the moon will\ndescribe with the vertical line of the place an angle of 64\u00b0.\n\n\"Such are the answers to the questions proposed to the Observatory of\nCambridge by the members of the Gun Club.\n\n\"To sum up--\n\n\"1st. The cannon must be placed in a country situated between 0\u00b0 and 28\u00b0\nof north or south latitude.\n\n\"2nd. It must be aimed at the zenith of the place.\n\n\"3rd. The projectile must have an initial speed of 12,000 yards a\nsecond.\n\n\"4th. It must be hurled on December 1st of next year, at 10hrs. 46mins.\n40secs. p.m.\n\n\"5th. It will meet the moon four days after its departure on December\n4th, at midnight precisely, at the moment she arrives at her zenith.\n\n\"The members of the Gun Club ought, therefore, at once to commence the\nlabour necessitated by such an enterprise, and be ready to put them into\nexecution at the moment fixed upon, for they will not find the moon in\nthe same conditions of perigee and zenith till eighteen years and eleven\ndays later.\n\n\"The staff of the Observatory of Cambridge puts itself entirely at their\ndisposition for questions of theoretic astronomy, and begs to join its\ncongratulations to those of the whole of America.\n\n\"On behalf of the staff,\n\n\"J.M. BELFAST,\n\n\"_Director of the Observatory of Cambridge_.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nTHE ROMANCE OF THE MOON.\n\n\nA spectator endowed with infinite power of sight, and placed at the\nunknown centre round which gravitates the universe, would have seen\nmyriads of atoms filling all space during the chaotic epoch of creation.\nBut by degrees, as centuries went on, a change took place; a law of\ngravitation manifested itself which the wandering atoms obeyed; these\natoms, combined chemically according to their affinities, formed\nthemselves into molecules, and made those nebulous masses with which the\ndepths of the heavens are strewed.\n\nThese masses were immediately animated by a movement of rotation round\ntheir central point. This centre, made of vague molecules, began to turn\non itself whilst progressively condensing; then, following the immutable\nlaws of mechanics, in proportion as its volume became diminished by\ncondensation its movement of rotation was accelerated, and these two\neffects persisting, there resulted a principal planet, the centre of the\nnebulous mass.\n\nBy watching attentively the spectator would then have seen other\nmolecules in the mass behave like the central planet, and condense in\nthe same manner by a movement of progressively-accelerated rotation, and\ngravitate round it under the form of innumerable stars. The nebulae, of\nwhich astronomers count nearly 5,000 at present, were formed.\n\nAmongst these 5,000 nebulae there is one that men have called the Milky\nWay, and which contains eighteen millions of stars, each of which has\nbecome the centre of a solar world.\n\nIf the spectator had then specially examined amongst these eighteen\nmillions of stars one of the most modest and least brilliant, a star of\nthe fourth order, the one that proudly named itself the sun, all the\nphenomena to which the formation of the universe is due would have\nsuccessively taken place under his eyes.\n\nIn fact, he would have perceived this sun still in its gaseous state,\nand composed of mobile molecules; he would have perceived it turning on\nits own axis to finish its work of concentration. This movement,\nfaithful to the laws of mechanics, would have been accelerated by the\ndiminution of volume, and a time would have come when the centrifugal\nforce would have overpowered the centripetal, which causes the molecules\nall to tend towards the centre.\n\nThen another phenomenon would have passed before the eyes of the\nspectator, and the molecules situated in the plane of the equator would\nhave formed several concentric rings like that of Saturn round the sun.\nIn their turn these rings of cosmic matter, seized with a movement of\nrotation round the central mass, would have been broken up into\nsecondary nebulae--that is to say, into planets.\n\nIf the spectator had then concentrated all his attention on these\nplanets he would have seen them behave exactly like the sun and give\nbirth to one or more cosmic rings, origin of those secondary bodies\nwhich we call satellites.\n\nThus in going up from the atom to the molecule, from the molecule to the\nnebulae, and from the nebulae to the principal star, from the principal\nstar to the sun, from the sun to the planet, and from the planet to the\nsatellite, we have the whole series of transformations undergone by the\ncelestial powers from the first days of the universe.\n\nThe sun seems lost amidst the immensities of the stellar universe, and\nyet it is related, by actual theories of science, to the nebula of the\nMilky Way. Centre of a world, and small as it appears amidst the\nethereal regions, it is still enormous, for its size is 1,400,000 times\nthat of the earth. Around it gravitate eight planets, struck off from\nits own mass in the first days of creation. These are, in proceeding\nfrom the nearest to the most distant, Mercury, Venus, the Earth, Mars,\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Between Mars and Jupiter circulate\nregularly other smaller bodies, the wandering _d\u00e9bris_, perhaps, of a\nstar broken up into thousands of pieces, of which the telescope has\ndiscovered eighty-two at present. Some of these asteroids are so small\nthat they could be walked round in a single day by going at a gymnastic\npace.\n\nOf these attendant bodies which the sun maintains in their elliptical\norbit by the great law of gravitation, some possess satellites of their\nown. Uranus has eight, Saturn eight, Jupiter four, Neptune three\nperhaps, and the Earth one; this latter, one of the least important of\nthe solar world, is called the Moon, and it is that one that the\nenterprising genius of the Americans means to conquer.\n\nThe Queen of Night, from her relative proximity and the spectacle\nrapidly renewed of her different phases, at first divided the attention\nof the inhabitants of the earth with the sun; but the sun tires the\neyesight, and the splendour of its light forces its admirers to lower\ntheir eyes.\n\nThe blonde Phoebe, more humane, graciously allows herself to be seen in\nher modest grace; she is gentle to the eye, not ambitious, and yet she\nsometimes eclipses her brother the radiant Apollo, without ever being\neclipsed by him. The Mahommedans understood what gratitude they owed to\nthis faithful friend of the earth, and they ruled their months at 29-1/2\ndays on her revolution.\n\nThe first people of the world dedicated particular worship to this\nchaste goddess. The Egyptians called her Isis, the Phoenicians Astarte,\nthe Greeks Phoebe, daughter of Jupiter and Latona, and they explained\nher eclipses by the mysterious visits of Diana and the handsome\nEndymion. The mythological legend relates that the Nemean lion traversed\nthe country of the moon before its apparition upon earth, and the poet\nAgesianax, quoted by Plutarch, celebrated in his sweet lines its soft\neyes, charming nose, and admirable mouth, formed by the luminous parts\nof the adorable Selene.\n\nBut though the ancients understood the character, temperament, and, in a\nword, moral qualities of the moon from a mythological point of view, the\nmost learned amongst them remained very ignorant of selenography.\n\nSeveral astronomers, however, of ancient times discovered certain\nparticulars now confirmed by science. Though the Arcadians pretended\nthey had inhabited the earth at an epoch before the moon existed, though\nSimplicius believed her immovable and fastened to the crystal vault,\nthough Tacitus looked upon her as a fragment broken off from the solar\norbit, and Clearch, the disciple of Aristotle, made of her a polished\nmirror upon which were reflected the images of the ocean--though, in\nshort, others only saw in her a mass of vapours exhaled by the earth, or\na globe half fire and half ice that turned on itself, other _savants_,\nby means of wise observations and without optical instruments, suspected\nmost of the laws that govern the Queen of Night.\n\nThus Thales of Miletus, B.C. 460, gave out the opinion that the moon was\nlighted up by the sun. Aristarchus of Samos gave the right explanation\nof her phases. Cleomenus taught that she shone by reflected light.\nBerose the Chaldean discovered that the duration of her movement of\nrotation was equal to that of her movement of revolution, and he thus\nexplained why the moon always presented the same side. Lastly,\nHipparchus, 200 years before the Christian era, discovered some\ninequalities in the apparent movements of the earth's satellite.\n\nThese different observations were afterwards confirmed, and other\nastronomers profited by them. Ptolemy in the second century, and the\nArabian Aboul Wefa in the tenth, completed the remarks of Hipparchus on\nthe inequalities that the moon undergoes whilst following the undulating\nline of its orbit under the action of the sun. Then Copernicus, in the\nfifteenth century, and Tycho Brahe, in the sixteenth, completely exposed\nthe system of the world and the part that the moon plays amongst the\ncelestial bodies.\n\nAt that epoch her movements were pretty well known, but very little of\nher physical constitution was known. It was then that Galileo explained\nthe phenomena of light produced in certain phases by the existence of\nmountains, to which he gave an average height of 27,000 feet.\n\nAfter him, Hevelius, an astronomer of Dantzig, lowered the highest\naltitudes to 15,000 feet; but his contemporary, Riccioli, brought them\nup again to 21,000 feet.\n\nHerschel, at the end of the eighteenth century, armed with a powerful\ntelescope, considerably reduced the preceding measurements. He gave a\nheight of 11,400 feet to the highest mountains, and brought down the\naverage of different heights to little more than 2,400 feet. But\nHerschel was mistaken too, and the observations of Schroeter, Louville,\nHalley, Nasmyth, Bianchini, Pastorff, Lohrman, Gruithuysen, and\nespecially the patient studies of MM. Boeer and Moedler, were necessary\nto definitely resolve the question. Thanks to these _savants_, the\nelevation of the mountains of the moon is now perfectly known. Boeer and\nMoedler measured 1,905 different elevations, of which six exceed 15,000\nfeet and twenty-two exceed 14,400 feet. Their highest summit towers to a\nheight of 22,606 feet above the surface of the lunar disc.\n\nAt the same time the survey of the moon was being completed; she\nappeared riddled with craters, and her essentially volcanic nature was\naffirmed by each observation. From the absence of refraction in the rays\nof the planets occulted by her it is concluded that she can have no\natmosphere. This absence of air entails absence of water; it therefore\nbecame manifest that the Selenites, in order to live under such\nconditions, must have a special organisation, and differ singularly from\nthe inhabitants of the earth.\n\nLastly, thanks to new methods, more perfected instruments searched the\nmoon without intermission, leaving not a point of her surface\nunexplored, and yet her diameter measures 2,150 miles; her surface is\none-thirteenth of the surface of the globe, and her volume\none-forty-ninth of the volume of the terrestrial spheroid; but none of\nher secrets could escape the astronomers' eyes, and these clever\n_savants_ carried their wonderful observations still further.\n\nThus they remarked that when the moon was at her full the disc appeared\nin certain places striped with white lines, and during her phases\nstriped with black lines. By prosecuting the study of these with greater\nprecision they succeeded in making out the exact nature of these lines.\nThey are long and narrow furrows sunk between parallel ridges, bordering\ngenerally upon the edges of the craters; their length varied from ten to\none hundred miles, and their width was about 1,600 yards. Astronomers\ncalled them furrows, and that was all they could do; they could not\nascertain whether they were the dried-up beds of ancient rivers or not.\nThe Americans hope, some day or other, to determine this geological\nquestion. They also undertake to reconnoitre the series of parallel\nramparts discovered on the surface of the moon by Gruithuysen, a learned\nprofessor of Munich, who considered them to be a system of elevated\nfortifications raised by Selenite engineers. These two still obscure\npoints, and doubtless many others, can only be definitely settled by\ndirect communication with the moon.\n\nAs to the intensity of her light there is nothing more to be learnt; it\nis 300,000 times weaker than that of the sun, and its heat has no\nappreciable action upon thermometers; as to the phenomenon known as the\n\"ashy light,\" it is naturally explained by the effect of the sun's rays\ntransmitted from the earth to the moon, and which seem to complete the\nlunar disc when it presents a crescent form during its first and last\nphases.\n\nSuch was the state of knowledge acquired respecting the earth's\nsatellite which the Gun Club undertook to perfect under all its aspects,\ncosmographical, geographical, geological, political, and moral.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nWHAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE AND WHAT IS NO LONGER ALLOWED TO BE\nBELIEVED IN THE UNITED STATES.\n\n\nThe immediate effect of Barbicane's proposition was that of bringing out\nall astronomical facts relative to the Queen of Night. Everybody began\nto study her assiduously. It seemed as if the moon had appeared on the\nhorizon for the first time, and that no one had ever seen her in the sky\nbefore. She became the fashion; she was the lion of the day, without\nappearing less modest on that account, and took her place amongst the\n\"stars\" without being any the prouder. The newspapers revived old\nanecdotes in which this \"Sun of the wolves\" played a part; they recalled\nthe influence which the ignorance of past ages had ascribed to her; they\nsang about her in every tone; a little more and they would have quoted\nher witty sayings; the whole of America was filled with selenomania.\n\nThe scientific journals treated the question which touched upon the\nenterprise of the Gun Club more specially; they published the letter\nfrom the Observatory of Cambridge, they commented upon it and approved\nof it without reserve.\n\nIn short, even the most ignorant Yankee was no longer allowed to be\nignorant of a single fact relative to his satellite, nor, to the oldest\nwomen amongst them, to have any superstitions about her left. Science\nflooded them; it penetrated into their eyes and ears; it was impossible\nto be an ass--in astronomy.\n\nUntil then many people did not know how the distance between the earth\nand the moon had been calculated. This fact was taken advantage of to\nexplain to them that it was done by measuring the parallax of the moon.\nIf the word \"parallax\" seemed new to them, they were told it was the\nangle formed by two straight lines drawn from either extremity of the\nearth's radius to the moon. If they were in doubt about the perfection\nof this method, it was immediately proved to them that not only was the\nmean distance 234,347 miles, but that astronomers were right to within\nseventy miles.\n\nTo those who were not familiar with the movements of the moon, the\nnewspapers demonstrated daily that she possesses two distinct movements,\nthe first being that of rotation upon her axis, the second that of\nrevolution round the earth, accomplishing both in the same time--that is\nto say, in 27-1/3 days.\n\nThe movement of rotation is the one that causes night and day on the\nsurface of the moon, only there is but one day and one night in a lunar\nmonth, and they each last 354-1/3 hours. But, happily, the face, turned\ntowards the terrestrial globe, is lighted by it with an intensity equal\nto the light of fourteen moons. As to the other face, the one always\ninvisible, it has naturally 354 hours of absolute night, tempered only\nby \"the pale light that falls from the stars.\" This phenomenon is due\nsolely to the peculiarity that the movements of rotation and revolution\nare accomplished in rigorously equal periods, a phenomenon which,\naccording to Cassini and Herschel, is common to the satellites of\nJupiter, and, very probably to the other satellites.\n\nSome well-disposed but rather unyielding minds did not quite understand\nat first how, if the moon invariably shows the same face to the earth\nduring her revolution, she describes one turn round herself in the same\nperiod of time. To such it was answered--\"Go into your dining-room, and\nturn round the table so as always to keep your face towards the centre;\nwhen your circular walk is ended you will have described one circle\nround yourselves, since your eye will have successively traversed every\npoint of the room. Well, then, the room is the heavens, the table is the\nearth, and you are the moon!\"\n\nAnd they go away delighted with the comparison.\n\nThus, then, the moon always presents the same face to the earth; still,\nto be quite exact, it should be added that in consequence of certain\nfluctuations from north to south and from west to east, called\nlibration, she shows rather more than the half of her disc, about 0.57.\n\nWhen the ignoramuses knew as much as the director of the Cambridge\nObservatory about the moon's movement of rotation they began to make\nthemselves uneasy about her movement of revolution round the earth, and\ntwenty scientific reviews quickly gave them the information they wanted.\nThey then learnt that the firmament, with its infinite stars, may be\nlooked upon as a vast dial upon which the moon moves, indicating the\ntime to all the inhabitants of the earth; that it is in this movement\nthat the Queen of Night shows herself in her different phases, that she\nis full when she is in opposition with the sun--that is to say, when the\nthree bodies are on a line with each other, the earth being in the\ncentre; that the moon is new when she is in conjunction with the\nsun--that is to say, when she is between the sun and the earth; lastly,\nthat the moon is in her first or last quarter when she makes, with the\nsun and the earth, a right angle of which she occupies the apex.\n\nSome perspicacious Yankees inferred in consequence that eclipses could\nonly take place at the periods of conjunction or opposition, and their\nreasoning was just. In conjunction the moon can eclipse the sun, whilst\nin opposition it is the earth that can eclipse him in her turn; and the\nreason these eclipses do not happen twice in a lunar month is because\nthe plane upon which the moon moves is elliptical like that of the\nearth.\n\nAs to the height which the Queen of Night can attain above the horizon,\nthe letter from the Observatory of Cambridge contained all that can be\nsaid about it. Every one knew that this height varies according to the\nlatitude of the place where the observation is taken. But the only zones\nof the globe where the moon reaches her zenith--that is to say, where\nshe is directly above the heads of the spectators--are necessarily\ncomprised between the 28th parallels and the equator. Hence the\nimportant recommendation given to attempt the experiment upon some point\nin this part of the globe, in order that the projectile may be hurled\nperpendicularly, and may thus more quickly escape the attraction of\ngravitation. This was a condition essential to the success of the\nenterprise, and public opinion was much exercised thereupon.\n\nAs to the line followed by the moon in her revolution round the earth,\nthe Observatory of Cambridge had demonstrated to the most ignorant that\nit is an ellipse of which the earth occupies one of the foci. These\nelliptical orbits are common to all the planets as well as to all the\nsatellites, and rational mechanism rigorously proves that it could not\nbe otherwise. It was clearly understood that when at her apogee the moon\nwas farthest from the earth, and when at her perigee she was nearest to\nour planet.\n\nThis, therefore, was what every American knew whether he wished to or\nno, and what no one could decently be ignorant of. But if these true\nprinciples rapidly made their way, certain illusive fears and many\nerrors were with difficulty cleared away.\n\nSome worthy people maintained, for instance, that the moon was an\nancient comet, which, whilst travelling along its elongated orbit round\nthe sun, passed near to the earth, and was retained in her circle of\nattraction. The drawing-room astronomers pretended to explain thus the\nburnt aspect of the moon, a misfortune of which they accused the sun.\nOnly when they were told to notice that comets have an atmosphere, and\nthat the moon has little or none, they did not know what to answer.\n\nOthers belonging to the class of \"Shakers\" manifested certain fears\nabout the moon; they had heard that since the observations made in the\ntimes of the Caliphs her movement of revolution had accelerated in a\ncertain proportion; they thence very logically concluded that an\nacceleration of movement must correspond to a diminution in the distance\nbetween the two bodies, and that this double effect going on infinitely\nthe moon would one day end by falling into the earth. However, they were\nobliged to reassure themselves and cease to fear for future generations\nwhen they were told that according to the calculations of Laplace, an\nillustrious French mathematician, this acceleration of movement was\nrestricted within very narrow limits, and that a proportional diminution\nwill follow it. Thus the equilibrium of the solar world cannot be\ndisturbed in future centuries.\n\nLastly there was the superstitious class of ignoramuses to be dealt\nwith; these are not content with being ignorant; they know what does not\nexist, and about the moon they know a great deal. Some of them\nconsidered her disc to be a polished mirror by means of which people\nmight see themselves from different points on the earth, and communicate\ntheir thoughts to one another. Others pretended that out of 1,000 new\nmoons 950 had brought some notable change, such as cataclysms,\nrevolutions, earthquakes, deluges, &c. they therefore believed in the\nmysterious influence of the Queen of Night on human destinies; they\nthink that every Selenite is connected by some sympathetic tie with each\ninhabitant of the earth; they pretend, with Dr. Mead, that she entirely\ngoverns the vital system--that boys are born during the new moon and\ngirls during her last quarter, &c., &c. But at last it became necessary\nto give up these vulgar errors, to come back to truth; and if the moon,\nstripped of her influence, lost her prestige in the minds of courtesans\nof every power, if some turned their backs on her, the immense majority\nwere in her favour. As to the Yankees, they had no other ambition than\nthat of taking possession of this new continent of the sky, and to plant\nupon its highest summit the star-spangled banner of the United States of\nAmerica.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nTHE HYMN OF THE CANNON-BALL.\n\n\nThe Cambridge Observatory had, in its memorable letter of October 7th,\ntreated the question from an astronomical point of view--the mechanical\npoint had still to be treated. It was then that the practical\ndifficulties would have seemed insurmountable to any other country but\nAmerica; but there they were looked upon as play.\n\nPresident Barbicane had, without losing any time, nominated a working\ncommittee in the heart of the Gun Club. This committee was in three\nsittings to elucidate the three great questions of the cannon, the\nprojectile, and the powder. It was composed of four members very learned\nupon these matters. Barbicane had the casting vote, and with him were\nassociated General Morgan, Major Elphinstone, and, lastly, the\ninevitable J.T. Maston, to whom were confided the functions of\nsecretary.\n\nOn the 8th of October the committee met at President Barbicane's house,\nNo. 3, Republican-street; as it was important that the stomach should\nnot trouble so important a debate, the four members of the Gun Club took\ntheir seats at a table covered with sandwiches and teapots. J.T. Maston\nimmediately screwed his pen on to his steel hook and the business began.\n\nBarbicane opened the meeting as follows:--\n\n\"Dear colleagues,\" said he, \"we have to solve one of the more important\nproblems in ballistics--that greatest of sciences which treats of the\nmovement of projectiles--that is to say, of bodies hurled into space by\nsome power of impulsion and then left to themselves.\"\n\n\"Oh, ballistics, ballistics!\" cried J.T. Maston in a voice of emotion.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" continued Barbicane, \"the most logical thing would be to\nconsecrate this first meeting to discussing the engine.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered General Morgan.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" continued Barbicane, \"after mature deliberation, it\nseems to me that the question of the projectile ought to precede that of\nthe cannon, and that the dimensions of the latter ought to depend upon\nthe dimensions of the former.\"\n\nJ.T. Maston here interrupted the president, and was heard with the\nattention which his magnificent past career deserved.\n\n\"My dear friends,\" said he in an inspired tone, \"our president is right\nto give the question of the projectile the precedence of every other;\nthe cannon-ball we mean to hurl at the moon will be our messenger, our\nambassador, and I ask your permission to regard it from an entirely\nmoral point of view.\"\n\nThis new way of looking at a projectile excited the curiosity of the\nmembers of the committee; they therefore listened attentively to the\nwords of J.T. Maston.\n\n\"My dear colleagues,\" he continued, \"I will be brief. I will lay aside\nthe material projectile--the projectile that kills--in order to take up\nthe mathematical projectile--the moral projectile. A cannon-ball is to\nme the most brilliant manifestation of human power, and by creating it\nman has approached nearest to the Creator!\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" said Major Elphinstone.\n\n\"In fact,\" cried the orator, \"if God has made the stars and the planets,\nman has made the cannon-ball--that criterion of terrestrial speed--that\nreduction of bodies wandering in space which are really nothing but\nprojectiles. Let Providence claim the speed of electricity, light, the\nstars, comets, planets, satellites, sound, and wind! But ours is the\nspeed of the cannon-ball--a hundred times greater than that of trains\nand the fastest horses!\"\n\nJ.T. Maston was inspired; his accents became quite lyrical as he chanted\nthe hymn consecrated to the projectile.\n\n\"Would you like figures?\" continued he; \"here are eloquent ones. Take\nthe simple 24 pounder; though it moves 80,000 times slower than\nelectricity, 64,000 times slower than light, 76 times slower than the\nearth in her movement of translation round the sun, yet when it leaves\nthe cannon it goes quicker than sound; it goes at the rate of 14 miles a\nminute, 840 miles an hour, 20,100 miles a day--that is to say, at the\nspeed of the points of the equator in the globe's movement of rotation,\n7,336,500 miles a year. It would therefore take 11 days to get to the\nmoon, 12 years to get to the sun, 360 years to reach Neptune, at the\nlimits of the solar world. That is what this modest cannon-ball, the\nwork of our hands, can do! What will it be, therefore, when, with twenty\ntimes that speed, we shall hurl it with a rapidity of seven miles a\nsecond? Ah! splendid shot! superb projectile! I like to think you will\nbe received up there with the honours due to a terrestrial ambassador!\"\n\nCheers greeted this brilliant peroration, and J.T. Maston, overcome with\nemotion, sat down amidst the felicitations of his colleagues.\n\n\"And now,\" said Barbicane, \"that we have given some time to poetry, let\nus proceed to facts.\"\n\n\"We are ready,\" answered the members of the committee as they each\ndemolished half-a-dozen sandwiches.\n\n\"You know what problem it is we have to solve,\" continued the president;\n\"it is that of endowing a projectile with a speed of 12,000 yards per\nsecond. I have every reason to believe that we shall succeed, but at\npresent let us see what speeds we have already obtained; General Morgan\ncan edify us upon that subject.\"\n\n\"So much the more easily,\" answered the general, \"because during the war\nI was a member of the Experiment Commission. The 100-pound cannon of\nDahlgren, with a range of 5,000 yards, gave their projectiles an initial\nspeed of 500 yards a second.\"\n\n\"Yes; and the Rodman Columbiad?\" (the Americans gave the name of\n\"Columbiad\" to their enormous engines of destruction) asked the\npresident.\n\n\"The Rodman Columbiad, tried at Fort Hamilton, near New York, hurled a\nprojectile, weighing half a ton, a distance of six miles, with a speed\nof 800 yards a second, a result which neither Armstrong nor Palliser has\nobtained in England.\"\n\n\"Englishmen are nowhere!\" said J.T. Maston, pointing his formidable\nsteel hook eastward.\n\n\"Then,\" resumed Barbicane, \"a speed of 800 yards is the maximum obtained\nat present.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Morgan.\n\n\"I might add, however,\" replied J.T. Maston, \"that if my mortar had not\nbeen blown up--\"\n\n\"Yes, but it was blown up,\" replied Barbicane with a benevolent gesture.\n\"We must take the speed of 800 yards for a starting point. We must keep\ntill another meeting the discussion of the means used to produce this\nspeed; allow me to call your attention to the dimensions which our\nprojectile must have. Of course it must be something very different to\none of half a ton weight.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the major.\n\n\"Because,\" quickly answered J.T. Maston, \"it must be large enough to\nattract the attention of the inhabitants of the moon, supposing there\nare any.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Barbicane, \"and for another reason still more\nimportant.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Barbicane?\" asked the major.\n\n\"I mean that it is not enough to send up a projectile and then to think\nno more about it; we must follow it in its transit.\"\n\n\"What?\" said the general, slightly surprised at the proposition.\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Barbicane, like a man who knew what he was saying,\n\"or our experiment will be without result.\"\n\n\"But then,\" replied the major, \"you will have to give the projectile\nenormous dimensions.\"\n\n\"No. Please grant me your attention. You know that optical instruments\nhave acquired great perfection; certain telescopes increase objects six\nthousand, and bring the moon to within a distance of forty miles. Now at\nthat distance objects sixty feet square are perfectly visible. The power\nof penetration of the telescope has not been increased, because that\npower is only exercised to the detriment of their clearness, and the\nmoon, which is only a reflecting mirror, does not send a light intense\nenough for the telescopes to increase objects beyond that limit.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, what do you mean to do?\" asked the general. \"Do you\nintend giving a diameter of sixty feet to your projectile?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You are not going to take upon yourself the task of making the moon\nmore luminous?\"\n\n\"I am, though.\"\n\n\"That's rather strong!\" exclaimed Maston.\n\n\"Yes, but simple,\" answered Barbicane. \"If I succeed in lessening the\ndensity of the atmosphere which the moon's light traverses, shall I not\nrender that light more intense?\"\n\n\"Evidently.\"\n\n\"In order to obtain that result I shall only have to establish my\ntelescope upon some high mountain. We can do that.\"\n\n\"I give in,\" answered the major; \"you have such a way of simplifying\nthings! What enlargement do you hope to obtain thus?\"\n\n\"One of 48,000 times, which will bring the moon within five miles only,\nand objects will only need a diameter of nine feet.\"\n\n\"Perfect!\" exclaimed J.T. Maston; \"then our projectile will have a\ndiameter of nine feet?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"Allow me to inform you, however,\" returned Major Elphinstone, \"that its\nweight will still be--\"\n\n\"Oh, major!\" answered Barbicane, \"before discussing its weight allow me\nto tell you that our forefathers did marvels in that way. Far be it from\nme to pretend that ballistics have not progressed, but it is well to\nknow that in the Middle Ages surprising results were obtained, I dare\naffirm, even more surprising than ours.\"\n\n\"Justify your statement,\" exclaimed J.T. Maston.\n\n\"Nothing is easier,\" answered Barbicane; \"I can give you some examples.\nAt the siege of Constantinople by Mahomet II., in 1453, they hurled\nstone bullets that weighed 1,900 lbs.; at Malta, in the time of its\nknights, a certain cannon of Fort Saint Elme hurled projectiles weighing\n2,500 lbs. According to a French historian, under Louis XI. a mortar\nhurled a bomb of 500 lbs. only; but that bomb, fired at the Bastille, a\nplace where mad men imprisoned wise ones, fell at Charenton, where wise\nmen imprison mad ones.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said J.T. Maston.\n\n\"Since, what have we seen, after all? The Armstrong cannons hurl\nprojectiles of 500 lbs., and the Rodman Columbiads projectiles of half a\nton! It seems, then, that if projectiles have increased in range they\nhave lost in weight. Now, if we turn our efforts in that direction, we\nmust succeed with the progress of the science in doubling the weight of\nthe projectiles of Mahomet II. and the Knights of Malta.\"\n\n\"That is evident,\" answered the major; \"but what metal do you intend to\nemploy for your own projectile?\"\n\n\"Simply cast-iron,\" said General Morgan.\n\n\"Cast-iron!\" exclaimed J.T. Maston disdainfully, \"that's very common for\na bullet destined to go to the moon.\"\n\n\"Do not let us exaggerate, my honourable friend,\" answered Morgan;\n\"cast-iron will be sufficient.\"\n\n\"Then,\" replied Major Elphinstone, \"as the weight of the projectile is\nin proportion to its volume, a cast-iron bullet, measuring nine feet in\ndiameter, will still be frightfully heavy.\"\n\n\"Yes, if it be solid, but not if it be hollow,\" said Barbicane.\n\n\"Hollow!--then it will be an obus?\"\n\n\"In which we can put despatches,\" replied J.T. Maston, \"and specimens of\nour terrestrial productions.\"\n\n\"Yes, an obus,\" answered Barbicane; \"that is what it must be; a solid\nbullet of 108 inches would weigh more than 200,000 lbs., a weight\nevidently too great; however, as it is necessary to give the projectile\na certain stability, I propose to give it a weight of 20,000 lbs.\"\n\n\"What will be the thickness of the metal?\" asked the major.\n\n\"If we follow the usual proportions,\" replied Morgan, \"a diameter of 800\ninches demands sides two feet thick at least.\"\n\n\"That would be much too thick,\" answered Barbicane; \"we do not want a\nprojectile to pierce armour-plate; it only needs sides strong enough to\nresist the pressure of the powder-gas. This, therefore, is the\nproblem:--What thickness ought an iron obus to have in order to weigh\nonly 20,000 lbs.? Our clever calculator, Mr. Maston, will tell us at\nonce.\"\n\n\"Nothing is easier,\" replied the honourable secretary.\n\nSo saying, he traced some algebraical signs on the paper, amongst which\nn^2 and x^2 frequently appeared. He even seemed to extract from them a\ncertain cubic root, and said--\n\n\"The sides must be hardly two inches thick.\"\n\n\"Will that be sufficient?\" asked the major doubtfully.\n\n\"No,\" answered the president, \"certainly not.\"\n\n\"Then what must be done?\" resumed Elphinstone, looking puzzled.\n\n\"We must use another metal instead of cast-iron.\"\n\n\"Brass?\" suggested Morgan.\n\n\"No; that is too heavy too, and I have something better than that to\npropose.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked the major.\n\n\"Aluminium,\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"Aluminium!\" cried all the three colleagues of the president.\n\n\"Certainly, my friends. You know that an illustrious French chemist,\nHenry St. Claire Deville, succeeded in 1854 in obtaining aluminium in a\ncompact mass. This precious metal possesses the whiteness of silver, the\nindestructibility of gold, the tenacity of iron, the fusibility of\ncopper, the lightness of glass; it is easily wrought, and is very widely\ndistributed in nature, as aluminium forms the basis of most rocks; it is\nthree times lighter than iron, and seems to have been created expressly\nto furnish us with the material for our projectile!\"\n\n\"Hurrah for aluminium!\" cried the secretary, always very noisy in his\nmoments of enthusiasm.\n\n\"But, my dear president,\" said the major, \"is not aluminium quoted\nexceedingly high?\"\n\n\"It was so,\" answered Barbicane; \"when first discovered a pound of\naluminium cost 260 to 280 dollars; then it fell to twenty-seven dollars,\nand now it is worth nine dollars.\"\n\n\"But nine dollars a pound,\" replied the major, who did not easily give\nin; \"that is still an enormous price.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, my dear major; but not out of reach.\"\n\n\"What will the projectile weigh, then?\" asked Morgan.\n\n\"Here is the result of my calculations,\" answered Barbicane. \"A\nprojectile of 108 inches in diameter and 12 inches thick would weigh, if\nit were made of cast-iron, 67,440 lbs.; cast in aluminium it would be\nreduced to 19,250 lbs.\"\n\n\"Perfect!\" cried Maston; \"that suits our programme capitally.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the major; \"but do you not know that at nine dollars a\npound the projectile would cost--\"\n\n\"One hundred seventy-three thousand and fifty dollars. Yes, I know that;\nbut fear nothing, my friends; money for our enterprise will not be\nwanting, I answer for that.\"\n\n\"It will be showered upon us,\" replied J.T. Maston.\n\n\"Well, what do you say to aluminium?\" asked the president.\n\n\"Adopted,\" answered the three members of the committee.\n\n\"As to the form of the projectile,\" resumed Barbicane, \"it is of little\nconsequence, since, once the atmosphere cleared, it will find itself in\nempty space; I therefore propose a round ball, which will turn on\nitself, if it so pleases.\"\n\nThus ended the first committee meeting. The question of the projectile\nwas definitely resolved upon, and J.T. Maston was delighted with the\nidea of sending an aluminium bullet to the Selenites, \"as it will give\nthem no end of an idea of the inhabitants of the earth!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nHISTORY OF THE CANNON.\n\n\nThe resolutions passed at this meeting produced a great effect outside.\nSome timid people grew alarmed at the idea of a projectile weighing\n20,000 lbs. hurled into space. People asked what cannon could ever\ntransmit an initial speed sufficient for such a mass. The report of the\nsecond meeting was destined to answer these questions victoriously.\n\nThe next evening the four members of the Gun Club sat down before fresh\nmountains of sandwiches and a veritable ocean of tea. The debate then\nbegan.\n\n\"My dear colleagues,\" said Barbicane, \"we are going to occupy ourselves\nwith the construction of the engine, its length, form, composition, and\nweight. It is probable that we shall have to give it gigantic\ndimensions, but, however great our difficulties might be, our industrial\ngenius will easily overcome them. Will you please listen to me and\nspare objections for the present? I do not fear them.\"\n\nAn approving murmur greeted this declaration.\n\n\"We must not forget,\" resumed Barbicane, \"to what point our yesterday's\ndebate brought us; the problem is now the following: how to give an\ninitial speed of 12,000 yards a second to a shot 108 inches in diameter\nweighing 20,000 lbs.\n\n\"That is the problem indeed,\" answered Major Elphinstone.\n\n\"When a projectile is hurled into space,\" resumed Barbicane, \"what\nhappens? It is acted upon by three independent forces, the resistance of\nthe medium, the attraction of the earth, and the force of impulsion with\nwhich it is animated. Let us examine these three forces. The resistance\nof the medium--that is to say, the resistance of the air--is of little\nimportance. In fact, the terrestrial atmosphere is only forty miles\ndeep. With a rapidity of 12,000 yards the projectile will cross that in\nfive seconds, and this time will be short enough to make the resistance\nof the medium insignificant. Let us now pass to the attraction of the\nearth--that is to say, to the weight of the projectile. We know that\nthat weight diminishes in an inverse ratio to the square of\ndistances--in fact, this is what physics teach us: when a body left to\nitself falls on the surface of the earth, it falls 15 feet in the first\nsecond, and if the same body had to fall 257,542 miles--that is to say,\nthe distance between the earth and the moon--its fall would be reduced\nto half a line in the first second. That is almost equivalent to\nimmobility. The question is, therefore, how progressively to overcome\nthis law of gravitation. How shall we do it? By the force of impulsion?\"\n\n\"That is the difficulty,\" answered the major.\n\n\"That is it indeed,\" replied the president. \"But we shall triumph over\nit, for this force of impulsion we want depends on the length of the\nengine and the quantity of powder employed, the one only being limited\nby the resistance of the other. Let us occupy ourselves, therefore,\nto-day with the dimensions to be given to the cannon. It is quite\nunderstood that we can make it, as large as we like, seeing it will not\nhave to be moved.\"\n\n\"All that is evident,\" replied the general.\n\n\"Until now,\" said Barbicane, \"the longest cannon, our enormous\nColumbiads, have not been more than twenty-five feet long; we shall\ntherefore astonish many people by the dimensions we shall have to\nadopt.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" exclaimed J.T. Maston. \"For my part, I ask for a cannon\nhalf a mile long at least!\"\n\n\"Half a mile!\" cried the major and the general.\n\n\"Yes, half a mile, and that will be half too short.\"\n\n\"Come, Maston,\" answered Morgan, \"you exaggerate.\"\n\n\"No, I do not,\" said the irate secretary; \"and I really do not know why\nyou tax me with exaggeration.\"\n\n\"Because you go too far.\"\n\n\"You must know, sir,\" answered J.T. Maston, looking dignified, \"that an\nartilleryman is like a cannon-ball, he can never go too far.\"\n\nThe debate was getting personal, but the president interfered.\n\n\"Be calm, my friends, and let us reason it out. We evidently want a gun\nof great range, as the length of the engine will increase the detention\nof gas accumulated behind the projectile, but it is useless to overstep\ncertain limits.\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said the major.\n\n\"What are the usual rules in such a case? Ordinarily the length of a\ncannon is twenty or twenty-five times the diameter of the projectile,\nand it weighs 235 to 240 times its weight.\"\n\n\"It is not enough,\" cried J.T. Maston with impetuosity.\n\n\"I agree to that, my worthy friend, and in fact by keeping that\nproportion for a projectile nine feet wide, weighing 30,000 lbs., the\nengine would only have a length of 225 feet and a weight of 7,200,000\nlbs.\"\n\n\"That is ridiculous,\" resumed J.T. Maston. \"You might as well take a\npistol.\"\n\n\"I think so too,\" answered Barbicane; \"that is why I propose to\nquadruple that length, and to construct a cannon 900 feet long.\"\n\nThe general and the major made some objections, but, nevertheless, this\nproposition, strongly supported by the secretary, was definitely\nadopted.\n\n\"Now,\" said Elphinstone, \"what thickness must we give its sides?\"\n\n\"A thickness of six feet,\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"You do not think of raising such a mass upon a gun-carriage?\" asked the\nmajor.\n\n\"That would be superb, however! said J.T. Maston.\n\n\"But impracticable,\" answered Barbicane. \"No, I think of casting this\nengine in the ground itself, binding it up with wrought-iron hoops, and\nthen surrounding it with a thick mass of stone and cement masonry. When\nit is cast it must be bored with great precision so as to prevent\nwindage, so there will be no loss of gas, and all the expansive force of\nthe powder will be employed in the propulsion.\"\n\n\"Hurrah! hurrah!\" said Maston, \"we have our cannon.\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" answered Barbicane, calming his impatient friend with his\nhand.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because we have not discussed its form. Shall it be a cannon, howitzer,\nor a mortar?\"\n\n\"A cannon,\" replied Morgan.\n\n\"A howitzer,\" said the major.\n\n\"A mortar,\" exclaimed J.T. Maston.\n\nA fresh discussion was pending, each taking the part of his favourite\nweapon, when the president stopped it short.\n\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"I will soon make you agree. Our Columbiad will\nbe a mixture of all three. It will be a cannon, because the\npowder-magazine will have the same diameter as the chamber. It will be a\nhowitzer, because it will hurl an obus. Lastly, it will be a mortar,\nbecause it will be pointed at an angle of 90\u00b0, and that without any\nchance of recoil; unalterably fixed to the ground, it will communicate\nto the projectile all the power of impulsion accumulated in its body.\"\n\n\"Adopted, adopted,\" answered the members of the committee.\n\n\"One question,\" said Elphinstone, \"and will this _canobusomortar_ be\nrifled?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Barbicane. \"No, we must have an enormous initial speed,\nand you know very well that a shot leaves a rifle less rapidly than a\nsmooth-bore.\"\n\n\"True,\" answered the major.\n\n\"Well, we have it this time,\" repeated J.T. Maston.\n\n\"Not quite yet,\" replied the president.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because we do not yet know of what metal it will be made.\"\n\n\"Let us decide that without delay.\"\n\n\"I was going to propose it to you.\"\n\nThe four members of the committee each swallowed a dozen sandwiches,\nfollowed by a cup of tea, and the debate recommenced.\n\n\"Our cannon,\" said Barbicane, \"must be possessed of great tenacity,\ngreat hardness; it must be infusible by heat, indissoluble, and\ninoxydable by the corrosive action of acids.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt about that,\" answered the major, \"and as we shall\nhave to employ a considerable quantity of metal we shall not have much\nchoice.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Morgan, \"I propose for the fabrication of the\nColumbiad the best alloy hitherto known--that is to say, 100 parts of\ncopper, 12 of tin, and 6 of brass.\"\n\n\"My friends,\" answered the president, \"I agree that this composition has\ngiven excellent results; but in bulk it would be too dear and very hard\nto work. I therefore think we must adopt an excellent material, but\ncheap, such as cast-iron. Is not that your opinion, major?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" answered Elphinstone.\n\n\"In fact,\" resumed Barbicane, \"cast-iron costs ten times less than\nbronze; it is easily melted, it is readily run into sand moulds, and is\nrapidly manipulated; it is, therefore, an economy of money and time.\nBesides, that material is excellent, and I remember that during the war\nat the siege of Atlanta cast-iron cannon fired a thousand shots each\nevery twenty minutes without being damaged by it.\"\n\n\"Yet cast-iron is very brittle,\" answered Morgan.\n\n\"Yes, but it possesses resistance too. Besides, we shall not let it\nexplode, I can answer for that.\"\n\n\"It is possible to explode and yet be honest,\" replied J.T. Maston\nsententiously.\n\n\"Evidently,\" answered Barbicane. \"I am, therefore, going to beg our\nworthy secretary to calculate the weight of a cast-iron cannon 900 feet\nlong, with an inner diameter of nine feet, and sides six feet thick.\"\n\n\"At once,\" answered J.T. Maston, and, as he had done the day before, he\nmade his calculations with marvellous facility, and said at the end of a\nminute--\n\n\"This cannon will weigh 68,040 tons.\"\n\n\"And how much will that cost at two cents a pound?\"\n\n\"Two million five hundred and ten thousand seven hundred and one\ndollars.\"\n\nJ.T. Maston, the major, and the general looked at Barbicane anxiously.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" said the president, \"I can only repeat what I said to\nyou yesterday, don't be uneasy; we shall not want for money.\"\n\nUpon this assurance of its president the committee broke up, after\nhaving fixed a third meeting for the next evening.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHE QUESTION OF POWDERS.\n\n\nThe question of powder still remained to be settled. The public awaited\nthis last decision with anxiety. The size of the projectile and length\nof the cannon being given, what would be the quantity of powder\nnecessary to produce the impulsion? This terrible agent, of which,\nhowever, man has made himself master, was destined to play a part in\nunusual proportions.\n\nIt is generally known and often asserted that gunpowder was invented in\nthe fourteenth century by the monk Schwartz, who paid for his great\ndiscovery with his life. But it is nearly proved now that this story\nmust be ranked among the legends of the Middle Ages. Gunpowder was\ninvented by no one; it is a direct product of Greek fire, composed, like\nit, of sulphur and saltpetre; only since that epoch these mixtures;\nwhich were only dissolving, have been transformed into detonating\nmixtures.\n\nBut if learned men know perfectly the false history of gunpowder, few\npeople are aware of its mechanical power. Now this is necessary to be\nknown in order to understand the importance of the question submitted to\nthe committee.\n\nThus a litre of gunpowder weighs about 2 lbs.; it produces, by burning,\nabout 400 litres of gas; this gas, liberated, and under the action of a\ntemperature of 2,400\u00b0, occupies the space of 4,000 litres. Therefore the\nvolume of powder is to the volume of gas produced by its deflagration as\n1 to 400. The frightful force of this gas, when it is compressed into a\nspace 4,000 times too small, may be imagined.\n\nThis is what the members of the committee knew perfectly when, the next\nday, they began their sitting. Major Elphinstone opened the debate.\n\n\"My dear comrades,\" said the distinguished chemist, \"I am going to begin\nwith some unexceptionable figures, which will serve as a basis for our\ncalculation. The 24-lb. cannon-ball, of which the Hon. J.T. Maston spoke\nthe day before yesterday, is driven out of the cannon by 16 lbs. of\npowder only.\"\n\n\"You are certain of your figures?\" asked Barbicane.\n\n\"Absolutely certain,\" answered the major. \"The Armstrong cannon only\nuses 75 lbs. of powder for a projectile of 800 lbs., and the Rodman\nColumbiad only expends 160 lbs. of powder to send its half-ton bullet\nsix miles. These facts cannot be doubted, for I found them myself in the\nreports of the Committee of Artillery.\"\n\n\"That is certain,\" answered the general.\n\n\"Well,\" resumed the major, \"the conclusion to be drawn from these\nfigures is that the quantity of powder does not augment with the weight\nof the shot; in fact, if a shot of 24 lbs. took 16 lbs. of powder, and,\nin other terms, if in ordinary cannons a quantity of powder weighing\ntwo-thirds of the weight of the projectile is used, this proportion is\nnot always necessary. Calculate, and you will see that for the shot of\nhalf a ton weight, instead of 333 lbs. of powder, this quantity has been\nreduced to 116 lbs. only.\n\n\"What are you driving at?\" asked the president.\n\n\"The extreme of your theory, my dear major,\" said J.T. Maston, \"would\nbring you to having no powder at all, provided your shot were\nsufficiently heavy.\"\n\n\"Friend Maston will have his joke even in the most serious things,\"\nreplied the major; \"but he need not be uneasy; I shall soon propose a\nquantity of powder that will satisfy him. Only I wish to have it\nunderstood that during the war, and for the largest guns, the weight of\nthe powder was reduced, after experience, to a tenth of the weight of\nthe shot.\"\n\n\"Nothing is more exact,\" said Morgan; \"but, before deciding the quantity\nof powder necessary to give the impulsion, I think it would be well to\nagree upon its nature.\"\n\n\"We shall use a large-grained powder,\" answered the major; \"its\ndeflagration is the most rapid.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" replied Morgan; \"but it is very brittle, and ends by\ndamaging the chamber of the gun.\"\n\n\"Certainly; but what would be bad for a gun destined for long service\nwould not be so for our Columbiad. We run no danger of explosion, and\nthe powder must immediately take fire to make its mechanical effect\ncomplete.\"\n\n\"We might make several touchholes,\" said J.T. Maston, \"so as to set fire\nto it in several places at the same time.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" answered Elphinstone, \"but that would make the working of it\nmore difficult. I therefore come back to my large-grained powder that\nremoves these difficulties.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" answered the general.\n\n\"To load his Columbiad,\" resumed the major, \"Rodman used a powder in\ngrains as large as chestnuts, made of willow charcoal, simply rarefied\nin cast-iron pans. This powder was hard and shining, left no stain on\nthe hands, contained a great proportion of hydrogen and oxygen,\ndeflagrated instantaneously, and, though very brittle, did not much\ndamage the mouthpiece.\"\n\n\"Well, it seems to me,\" answered J.T. Maston, \"that we have nothing to\nhesitate about, and that our choice is made.\"\n\n\"Unless you prefer gold-powder,\" replied the major, laughing, which\nprovoked a threatening gesture from the steel hook of his susceptible\nfriend.\n\nUntil then Barbicane had kept himself aloof from the discussion; he\nlistened, and had evidently an idea. He contented himself with saying\nsimply--\n\n\"Now, my friends, what quantity of powder do you propose?\"\n\nThe three members of the Gun Club looked at one another for the space of\na minute.\n\n\"Two hundred thousand pounds,\" said Morgan at last.\n\n\"Five hundred thousand,\" replied the major.\n\n\"Eight hundred thousand,\" exclaimed J.T. Maston.\n\nThis, time Elphinstone dared not tax his colleague with exaggeration. In\nfact, the question was that of sending to the moon a projectile weighing\n20,000 lbs., and of giving it an initial force of 2000 yards a second. A\nmoment of silence, therefore, followed the triple proposition made by\nthe three colleagues.\n\nIt was at last broken by President Barbicane.\n\n\"My brave comrades,\" said he in a quiet tone, \"I start from this\nprinciple, that the resistance of our cannon, in the given conditions,\nis unlimited. I shall, therefore, surprise the Honourable J.T. Maston\nwhen I tell him that he has been timid in his calculations, and I\npropose to double his 800,000 lbs. of powder.\"\n\n\"Sixteen hundred thousand pounds!\" shouted J.T. Maston, jumping out of\nhis chair.\n\n\"Quite as much as that.\"\n\n\"Then we shall have to come back to my cannon half a mile long.\"\n\n\"It is evident,\" said the major.\n\n\"Sixteen hundred thousand pounds of powder,\" resumed the Secretary of\nCommittee, \"will occupy about a space of 22,000 cubic feet; now, as your\ncannon will only hold about 54,000 cubic feet, it will be half full, and\nthe chamber will not be long enough to allow the explosion of the gas to\ngive sufficient impulsion to your projectile.\"\n\nThere was nothing to answer. J.T. Maston spoke the truth. They all\nlooked at Barbicane.\n\n\"However,\" resumed the president, \"I hold to that quantity of powder.\nThink! 1,600,000 pounds of powder will give 6,000,000,000 litres of\ngas.\"\n\n\"Then how is it to be done?\" asked the general.\n\n\"It is very simple. We must reduce this enormous quantity of powder,\nkeeping at the same time its mechanical power.\"\n\n\"Good! By what means?\"\n\n\"I will tell you,\" answered Barbicane simply.\n\nHis interlocutors all looked at him.\n\n\"Nothing is easier, in fact,\" he resumed, \"than to bring that mass of\npowder to a volume four times less. You all know that curious cellular\nmatter which constitutes the elementary tissues of vegetables?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the major, \"I understand you, Barbicane.\"\n\n\"This matter,\" said the president, \"is obtained in perfect purity in\ndifferent things, especially in cotton, which is nothing but the skin of\nthe seeds of the cotton plant. Now cotton, combined with cold nitric\nacid, is transformed into a substance eminently insoluble, eminently\ncombustible, eminently explosive. Some years ago, in 1832, a French\nchemist, Braconnot, discovered this substance, which he called\nxyloidine. In 1838, another Frenchman, Pelouze, studied its different\nproperties; and lastly, in 1846, Schonbein, professor of chemistry at\nBasle, proposed it as gunpowder. This powder is nitric cotton.\"\n\n\"Or pyroxyle,\" answered Elphinstone.\n\n\"Or fulminating cotton,\" replied Morgan.\n\n\"Is there not an American name to put at the bottom of this discovery?\"\nexclaimed J.T. Maston, animated by a lively sentiment of patriotism.\n\n\"Not one, unfortunately,\" replied the major.\n\n\"Nevertheless, to satisfy Maston,\" resumed the president, \"I may tell\nhim that one of our fellow-citizens may be annexed to the study of the\ncelluosity, for collodion, which is one of the principal agents in\nphotography, is simply pyroxyle dissolved in ether to which alcohol has\nbeen added, and it was discovered by Maynard, then a medical student.\"\n\n\"Hurrah for Maynard and fulminating cotton!\" cried the noisy secretary\nof the Gun Club.\n\n\"I return to pyroxyle,\" resumed Barbicane. \"You are acquainted with its\nproperties which make it so precious to us. It is prepared with the\ngreatest facility; cotton plunged in smoking nitric acid for fifteen\nminutes, then washed in water, then dried, and that is all.\"\n\n\"Nothing is more simple, certainty,\" said Morgan.\n\n\"What is more, pyroxyle is not damaged by moisture, a precious quality\nin our eyes, as it will take several days to load the cannon. Its\ninflammability takes place at 170\u00b0 instead of at 240\u00b0 and its\ndeflagration is so immediate that it may be fired on ordinary gunpowder\nbefore the latter has time to catch fire too.\"\n\n\"Perfect,\" answered the major.\n\n\"Only it will cost more.\"\n\n\"What does that matter?\" said J.T. Maston.\n\n\"Lastly, it communicates to projectiles a speed four times greater than\nthat of gunpowder. I may even add that if 8/10ths of its weight of\nnitrate of potash is added its expansive force is still greatly\naugmented.\"\n\n\"Will that be necessary?\" asked the major.\n\n\"I do not think so,\" answered Barbicane. \"Thus instead of 1,600,000 lbs.\nof powder, we shall only have 400,000 lbs. of fulminating cotton, and as\nwe can, without danger, compress 500 lbs. of cotton into 27 cubic feet,\nthat quantity will not take up more than 180 feet in the chamber of the\nColumbiad. By these means the projectile will have more than 700 feet of\nchamber to traverse under a force of 6,000,000,000 of litres of gas\nbefore taking its flight over the Queen of Night.\"\n\nHere J.T. Maston could not contain his emotion. He threw himself into\nthe arms of his friend with the violence of a projectile, and he would\nhave been stove in had he not have been bombproof.\n\nThis incident ended the first sitting of the committee. Barbicane and\nhis enterprising colleagues, to whom nothing seemed impossible, had just\nsolved the complex question of the projectile, cannon, and powder. Their\nplan being made, there was nothing left but to put it into execution.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nONE ENEMY AGAINST TWENTY-FIVE MILLIONS OF FRIENDS.\n\n\nThe American public took great interest in the least details of the Gun\nClub's enterprise. It followed the committee debates day by day. The\nmost simple preparations for this great experiment, the questions of\nfigures it provoked, the mechanical difficulties to be solved, all\nexcited popular opinion to the highest pitch.\n\nMore than a year would elapse between the commencement of the work and\nits completion; but the interval would not be void of excitement. The\nplace to be chosen for the boring, the casting the metal of the\nColumbiad, its perilous loading, all this was more than necessary to\nexcite public curiosity. The projectile, once fired, would be out of\nsight in a few seconds; then what would become of it, how it would\nbehave in space, how it would reach the moon, none but a few privileged\npersons would see with their own eyes. Thus, then, the preparations for\nthe experiment and the precise details of its execution constituted the\nreal source of interest.\n\nIn the meantime the purely scientific attraction of the enterprise was\nall at once heightened by an incident.\n\nIt is known what numerous legions of admirers and friends the Barbicane\nproject had called round its author. But, notwithstanding the number and\nimportance of the majority, it was not destined to be unanimous. One\nman, one out of all the United States, protested against the Gun Club.\nHe attacked it violently on every occasion, and--for human nature is\nthus constituted--Barbicane was more sensitive to this one man's\nopposition than to the applause of all the others.\n\nNevertheless he well knew the motive of this antipathy, from whence came\nthis solitary enmity, why it was personal and of ancient date; lastly,\nin what rivalry it had taken root.\n\nThe president of the Gun Club had never seen this persevering enemy.\nHappily, for the meeting of the two men would certainly have had\ndisastrous consequences. This rival was a _savant_ like Barbicane, a\nproud, enterprising, determined, and violent character, a pure Yankee.\nHis name was Captain Nicholl. He lived in Philadelphia.\n\nNo one is ignorant of the curious struggle which went on during the\nFederal war between the projectile and ironclad vessels, the former\ndestined to pierce the latter, the latter determined not to be pierced.\nThence came a radical transformation in the navies of the two\ncontinents. Cannon-balls and iron plates struggled for supremacy, the\nformer getting larger as the latter got thicker. Ships armed with\nformidable guns went into the fire under shelter of their invulnerable\narmour. The Merrimac, Monitor, ram Tennessee, and Wechhausen shot\nenormous projectiles after having made themselves proof against the\nprojectiles of other ships. They did to others what they would not have\nothers do to them, an immoral principle upon which the whole art of war\nis based.\n\nNow Barbicane was a great caster of projectiles, and Nicholl was an\nequally great forger of plate-armour. The one cast night and day at\nBaltimore, the other forged day and night at Philadelphia. Each followed\nan essentially different current of ideas.\n\nAs soon as Barbicane had invented a new projectile, Nicholl invented a\nnew plate armour. The president of the Gun Club passed his life in\npiercing holes, the captain in preventing him doing it. Hence a constant\nrivalry which even touched their persons. Nicholl appeared in\nBarbicane's dreams as an impenetrable ironclad against which he split,\nand Barbicane in Nicholl's dreams appeared like a projectile which\nripped him up.\n\nStill, although they ran along two diverging lines, these _savants_\nwould have ended by meeting each other in spite of all the axioms in\ngeometry; but then it would have been on a duel field. Happily for these\nworthy citizens, so useful to their country, a distance of from fifty to\nsixty miles separated them, and their friends put such obstacles in the\nway that they never met.\n\nAt present it was not clearly known which of the two inventors held the\npalm. The results obtained rendered a just decision difficult. It\nseemed, however, that in the end armour-plate would have to give way to\nprojectiles. Nevertheless, competent men had their doubts. At the latest\nexperiments the cylindro-conical shots of Barbicane had no more effect\nthan pins upon Nicholl's armour-plate. That day the forger of\nPhiladelphia believed himself victorious, and henceforth had nothing but\ndisdain for his rival. But when, later on, Barbicane substituted simple\nhowitzers of 600 lbs. for conical shots, the captain was obliged to go\ndown in his own estimation. It fact, these projectiles, though of\nmediocre velocity, drilled with holes and broke to pieces armour-plate\nof the best metal.\n\nThings had reached this point and victory seemed to rest with the\nprojectile, when the war ended the very day that Nicholl terminated a\nnew forged armour-plate. It was a masterpiece of its kind. It defied all\nthe projectiles in the world. The captain had it taken to the Washington\nPolygon and challenged the president of the Gun Club to pierce it.\nBarbicane, peace having been made, would not attempt the experiment.\n\nThen Nicholl, in a rage, offered to expose his armour-plate to the shock\nof any kind of projectile, solid, hollow, round, or conical.\n\nThe president, who was determined not to compromise his last success,\nrefused.\n\nNicholl, excited by this unqualified obstinacy, tried to tempt Barbicane\nby leaving him every advantage. He proposed to put his plate 200 yards\nfrom the gun. Barbicane still refused. At 100 yards? Not even at 75.\n\n\"At 50, then,\" cried the captain, through the newspapers, \"at 25 yards\nfrom my plate, and I will be behind it.\"\n\nBarbicane answered that even if Captain Nicholl would be in front of it\nhe would not fire any more.\n\nOn this reply, Nicholl could no longer contain himself. He had recourse\nto personalities; he insinuated cowardice--that the man who refuses to\nfire a shot from a cannon is very nearly being afraid of it; that, in\nshort, the artillerymen who fight now at six miles distance have\nprudently substituted mathematical formulae for individual courage, and\nthat there is as much bravery required to quietly wait for a cannon-ball\nbehind armour-plate as to send it according to all the rules of science.\n\nTo these insinuations Barbicane answered nothing. Perhaps he never knew\nabout them, for the calculations of his great enterprise absorbed him\nentirely.\n\nWhen he made his famous communication to the Gun Club, the anger of\nCaptain Nicholl reached its maximum. Mixed with it was supreme jealousy\nand a sentiment of absolute powerlessness. How could he invent anything\nbetter than a Columbiad 900 feet long? What armour-plate could ever\nresist a projectile of 30,000 lbs.? Nicholl was at first crushed by this\ncannon-ball, then he recovered and resolved to crush the proposition by\nthe weight of his best arguments.\n\nHe therefore violently attacked the labours of the Gun Club. He sent a\nnumber of letters to the newspapers, which they did not refuse to\npublish. He tried to demolish Barbicane's work scientifically. Once the\nwar begun, he called reasons of every kind to his aid, reasons it must\nbe acknowledged often specious and of bad metal.\n\nFirstly, Barbicane was violently attacked about his figures. Nicholl\ntried to prove by A + B the falseness of his formulae, and he accused\nhim of being ignorant of the rudimentary principles of ballistics.\nAmongst other errors, and according to Nicholl's own calculations, it\nwas impossible to give any body a velocity of 12,000 yards a second. He\nsustained, algebra in hand, that even with that velocity a projectile\nthus heavy would never pass the limits of the terrestrial atmosphere. It\nwould not even go eight leagues! Better still. Granted the velocity, and\ntaking it as sufficient, the shot would not resist the pressure of the\ngas developed by the combustion of 1,600,000 pounds of powder, and even\nif it did resist that pressure, it at least would not support such a\ntemperature; it would melt as it issued from the Columbiad, and would\nfall in red-hot rain on the heads of the imprudent spectators.\n\nBarbicane paid no attention to these attacks, and went on with his work.\n\nThen Nicholl considered the question in its other aspects. Without\nspeaking of its uselessness from all other points of view, he looked\nupon the experiment as exceedingly dangerous, both for the citizens who\nauthorised so condemnable a spectacle by their presence, and for the\ntowns near the deplorable cannon. He also remarked that if the\nprojectile did not reach its destination, a result absolutely\nimpossible, it was evident that it would fall on to the earth again, and\nthat the fall of such a mass multiplied by the square of its velocity\nwould singularly damage some point on the globe. Therefore, in such a\ncircumstance, and without any restriction being put upon the rights of\nfree citizens, it was one of those cases in which the intervention of\ngovernment became necessary, and the safety of all must not be\nendangered for the good pleasure of a single individual.\n\nIt will be seen to what exaggeration Captain Nicholl allowed himself to\nbe carried. He was alone in his opinion. Nobody took any notice of his\nCassandra prophecies. They let him exclaim as much as he liked, till his\nthroat was sore if he pleased. He had constituted himself the defender\nof a cause lost in advance. He was heard but not listened to, and he did\nnot carry off a single admirer from the president of the Gun Club, who\ndid not even take the trouble to refute his rival's arguments.\n\nNicholl, driven into his last intrenchments, and not being able to fight\nfor his opinion, resolved to pay for it. He therefore proposed in the\n_Richmond Inquirer_ a series of bets conceived in these terms and in an\nincreasing proportion.\n\nHe bet that--\n\n1. The funds necessary for the Gun Club's enterprise would not be\nforthcoming, 1,000 dols.\n\n2. That the casting of a cannon of 900 feet was impracticable and would\nnot succeed, 2,000 dols.\n\n3. That it would be impossible to load the Columbiad, and that the\npyroxyle would ignite spontaneously under the weight of the projectile,\n3,000 dols.\n\n4. That the Columbiad would burst at the first discharge, 4,000 dols.\n\n5. That the projectile would not even go six miles, and would fall a few\nseconds after its discharge, 5,000 dols.\n\nIt will be seen that the captain was risking an important sum in his\ninvincible obstinacy. No less than 15,000 dols. were at stake.\n\nNotwithstanding the importance of the wager, he received on the 19th of\nOctober a sealed packet of superb laconism, couched in these terms:--\n\n\"Baltimore, October 18th.\n\n\"Done.\n\n\"BARBICANE.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nFLORIDA AND TEXAS.\n\n\nThere still remained one question to be decided--a place favourable to\nthe experiment had to be chosen. According to the recommendation of the\nCambridge Observatory the gun must be aimed perpendicularly to the plane\nof the horizon--that is to say, towards the zenith. Now the moon only\nappears in the zenith in the places situated between 0\u00b0 and 28\u00b0 of\nlatitude, or, in other terms, when her declination is only 28\u00b0. The\nquestion was, therefore, to determine the exact point of the globe where\nthe immense Columbiad should be cast.\n\nOn the 20th of October the Gun Club held a general meeting. Barbicane\nbrought a magnificent map of the United States by Z. Belltropp. But\nbefore he had time to unfold it J.T. Maston rose with his habitual\nvehemence, and began to speak as follows:--\n\n\"Honourable colleagues, the question we are to settle to-day is really\nof national importance, and will furnish us with an occasion for doing a\ngreat act of patriotism.\"\n\nThe members of the Gun Club looked at each other without understanding\nwhat the orator was coming to.\n\n\"Not one of you,\" he continued, \"would think of doing anything to\nlessen the glory of his country, and if there is one right that the\nUnion may claim it is that of harbouring in its bosom the formidable\ncannon of the Gun Club. Now, under the present circumstances--\"\n\n\"Will you allow me--\" said Barbicane.\n\n\"I demand the free discussion of ideas,\" replied the impetuous J.T.\nMaston, \"and I maintain that the territory from which our glorious\nprojectile will rise ought to belong to the Union.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered several members.\n\n\"Well, then, as our frontiers do not stretch far enough, as on the south\nthe ocean is our limit, as we must seek beyond the United States and in\na neighbouring country this 28th parallel, this is all a legitimate\n_casus belli_, and I demand that war should be declared against Mexico!\"\n\n\"No, no!\" was cried from all parts.\n\n\"No!\" replied J.T. Maston. \"I am much astonished at hearing such a word\nin these precincts!\"\n\n\"But listen--\"\n\n\"Never! never!\" cried the fiery orator. \"Sooner or later this war will\nbe declared, and I demand that it should be this very day.\"\n\n\"Maston,\" said Barbicane, making his bell go off with a crash, \"I agree\nwith you that the experiment cannot and ought not to be made anywhere\nbut on the soil of the Union, but if I had been allowed to speak before,\nand you had glanced at this map, you would know that it is perfectly\nuseless to declare war against our neighbours, for certain frontiers of\nthe United States extend beyond the 28th parallel. Look, we have at our\ndisposition all the southern part of Texas and Florida.\"\n\nThis incident had no consequences; still it was not without regret that\nJ.T. Maston allowed himself to be convinced. It was, therefore, decided\nthat the Columbiad should be cast either on the soil of Texas or on that\nof Florida. But this decision was destined to create an unexampled\nrivalry between the towns of these two states.\n\nThe 28th parallel, when it touches the American coast, crosses the\npeninsula of Florida, and divides it into two nearly equal portions.\nThen, plunging into the Gulf of Mexico, it subtends the arc formed by\nthe coasts of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana; then skirting Texas,\noff which it cuts an angle, it continues its direction over Mexico,\ncrosses the Sonora and Old California, and loses itself in the Pacific\nOcean; therefore only the portions of Texas and Florida situated below\nthis parallel fulfilled the requisite conditions of latitude recommended\nby the Observatory of Cambridge.\n\nThe southern portion of Florida contains no important cities. It only\nbristles with forts raised against wandering Indians. One town only,\nTampa Town, could put in a claim in favour of its position.\n\nIn Texas, on the contrary, towns are more numerous and more important.\nCorpus Christi in the county of Nuaces, and all the cities situated on\nthe Rio Bravo, Laredo, Comalites, San Ignacio in Web, Rio Grande city in\nStarr, Edinburgh in Hidalgo, Santa-Rita, El Panda, and Brownsville in\nCameron, formed a powerful league against the pretensions of Florida.\n\nThe decision, therefore, was hardly made public before the Floridan and\nTexican deputies flocked to Baltimore by the shortest way. From that\nmoment President Barbicane and the influential members of the Gun Club\nwere besieged day and night by formidable claims. If seven towns of\nGreece contended for the honour of being Homer's birthplace, two entire\nstates threatened to fight over a cannon.\n\nThese rival parties were then seen marching with weapons about the\nstreets of the town. Every time they met a fight was imminent, which\nwould have had disastrous consequences. Happily the prudence and skill\nof President Barbicane warded off this danger. Personal demonstrations\nfound an outlet in the newspapers of the different states. It was thus\nthat the _New York Herald_ and the _Tribune_ supported the claims of\nTexas, whilst the _Times_ and the _American Review_ took the part of the\nFloridan deputies. The members of the Gun Club did not know which to\nlisten to.\n\nTexas came up proudly with its twenty-six counties, which it seemed to\nput in array; but Florida answered that twelve counties proved more than\ntwenty-six in a country six times smaller.\n\nTexas bragged of its 33,000 inhabitants; but Florida, much smaller,\nboasted of being much more densely populated with 56,000. Besides,\nFlorida accused Texas of being the home of paludian fevers, which\ncarried off, one year with another, several thousands of inhabitants,\nand Florida was not far wrong.\n\nIn its turn Texas replied that Florida need not envy its fevers, and\nthat it was, at least, imprudent to call other countries unhealthy when\nFlorida itself had chronic \"vomito negro,\" and Texas was not far wrong.\n\n\"Besides,\" added the Texicans through the _New York Herald_, \"there are\nrights due to a state that grows the best cotton in all America, a state\nwhich produces holm oak for building ships, a state that contains superb\ncoal and mines of iron that yield fifty per cent. of pure ore.\"\n\nTo that the _American Review_ answered that the soil of Florida, though\nnot so rich, offered better conditions for the casting of the Columbiad,\nas it was composed of sand and clay-ground.\n\n\"But,\" answered the Texicans, \"before anything can be cast in a place,\nit must get to that place; now communication with Florida is difficult,\nwhilst the coast of Texas offers Galveston Bay, which is fourteen\nleagues round, and could contain all the fleets in the world.\"\n\n\"Why,\" replied the newspapers devoted to Florida, \"your Galveston Bay is\nsituated above the 29th parallel, whilst our bay of Espiritu-Santo opens\nprecisely at the 28th degree of latitude, and by it ships go direct to\nTampa Town.\"\n\n\"A nice bay truly!\" answered Texas; \"it is half-choked up with sand.\"\n\n\"Any one would think, to hear you talk,\" cried Florida, \"that I was a\nsavage country.\"\n\n\"Well, the Seminoles do still wander over your prairies!\"\n\n\"And what about your Apaches and your Comanches--are they civilised?\"\n\nThe war had been thus kept up for some days when Florida tried to draw\nher adversary upon another ground, and one morning the _Times_\ninsinuated that the enterprise being \"essentially American,\" it ought\nonly to be attempted upon an \"essentially American\" territory.\n\nAt these words Texas could not contain itself.\n\n\"American!\" it cried, \"are we not as American as you? Were not Texas and\nFlorida both incorporated in the Union in 1845?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered the _Times_, \"but we have belonged to America\nsince 1820.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the _Tribune_, \"after having been Spanish or English for\n200 years, you were sold to the United States for 5,000,000 of dollars!\"\n\n\"What does that matter?\" answered Florida. \"Need we blush for that? Was\nnot Louisiana bought in 1803 from Napoleon for 16,000,000 of dollars?\"\n\n\"It is shameful!\" then cried the Texican deputies. \"A miserable slice of\nland like Florida to dare to compare itself with Texas, which, instead\nof being sold, made itself independent, which drove out the Mexicans on\nthe 2nd of March, 1836, which declared itself Federative Republican\nafter the victory gained by Samuel Houston on the banks of the San\nJacinto over the troops of Santa-Anna--a country, in short, which\nvoluntarily joined itself to the United States of America!\"\n\n\"Because it was afraid of the Mexicans!\" answered Florida.\n\n\"Afraid!\" From the day this word, really too cutting, was pronounced,\nthe situation became intolerable. An engagement was expected between the\ntwo parties in the streets of Baltimore. The deputies were obliged to be\nwatched.\n\nPresident Barbicane was half driven wild. Notes, documents, and letters\nfull of threats inundated his house. Which course ought he to decide\nupon? In the point of view of fitness of soil, facility of\ncommunications, and rapidity of transport, the rights of the two states\nwere really equal. As to the political personalities, they had nothing\nto do with the question.\n\nNow this hesitation and embarrassment had already lasted some time when\nBarbicane resolved to put an end to it; he called his colleagues\ntogether, and the solution he proposed to them was a profoundly wise\none, as will be seen from the following:--\n\n\"After due consideration,\" said he, \"of all that has just occurred\nbetween Florida and Texas, it is evident that the same difficulties will\nagain crop up between the towns of the favoured state. The rivalry will\nbe changed from state to city, and that is all. Now Texas contains\neleven towns with the requisite conditions that will dispute the honour\nof the enterprise, and that will create fresh troubles for us, whilst\nFlorida has but one; therefore I decide for Tampa Town!\"\n\nThe Texican deputies were thunderstruck at this decision. It put them\ninto a terrible rage, and they sent nominal provocations to different\nmembers of the Gun Club. There was only one course for the magistrates\nof Baltimore to take, and they took it. They had the steam of a special\ntrain got up, packed the Texicans into it, whether they would or no, and\nsent them away from the town at a speed of thirty miles an hour.\n\nBut they were not carried off too quickly to hurl a last and threatening\nsarcasm at their adversaries.\n\nMaking allusion to the width of Florida, a simple peninsula between two\nseas, they pretended it would not resist the shock, and would be blown\nup the first time the cannon was fired.\n\n\"Very well! let it be blown up!\" answered the Floridans with a laconism\nworthy of ancient times.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\"URBI ET ORBI.\"\n\n\nThe astronomical, mechanical, and topographical difficulties once\nremoved, there remained the question of money. An enormous sum was\nnecessary for the execution of the project. No private individual, no\nsingle state even, could have disposed of the necessary millions.\n\nPresident Barbicane had resolved--although the enterprise was\nAmerican--to make it a business of universal interest, and to ask every\nnation for its financial co-operation. It was the bounded right and duty\nof all the earth to interfere in the business of the satellite. The\nsubscription opened at Baltimore, for this end extended thence to all\nthe world--_urbi et orbi_.\n\nThis subscription was destined to succeed beyond all hope; yet the money\nwas to be given, not lent. The operation was purely disinterested, in\nthe literal meaning of the word, and offered no chance of gain.\n\nBut the effect of Barbicane's communication had not stopped at the\nfrontiers of the United States; it had crossed the Atlantic and Pacific,\nhad invaded both Asia and Europe, both Africa and Oceania. The\nobservatories of the Union were immediately put into communication with\nthe observatories of foreign countries; some--those of Paris, St.\nPetersburg, the Cape, Berlin, Altona, Stockholm, Warsaw, Hamburg, Buda,\nBologna, Malta, Lisbon, Benares, Madras, and Pekin--sent their\ncompliments to the Gun Club; the others prudently awaited the result.\n\nAs to the Greenwich Observatory, seconded by the twenty-two astronomical\nestablishments of Great Britain, it made short work of it; it boldly\ndenied the possibility of success, and took up Captain Nicholl's\ntheories. Whilst the different scientific societies promised to send\ndeputies to Tampa Town, the Greenwich staff met and contemptuously\ndismissed the Barbicane proposition. This was pure English jealousy and\nnothing else.\n\nGenerally speaking, the effect upon the world of science was excellent,\nand from thence it passed to the masses, who, in general, were greatly\ninterested in the question, a fact of great importance, seeing those\nmasses were to be called upon to subscribe a considerable capital.\n\nOn the 8th of October President Barbicane issued a manifesto, full of\nenthusiasm, in which he made appeal to \"all persons on the face of the\nearth willing to help.\" This document, translated into every language,\nhad great success.\n\nSubscriptions were opened in the principal towns of the Union with a\ncentral office at the Baltimore Bank, 9, Baltimore street; then\nsubscriptions were opened in the different countries of the two\ncontinents:--At Vienna, by S.M. de Rothschild; St. Petersburg, Stieglitz\nand Co.; Paris, Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier; Stockholm, Tottie and Arfuredson;\nLondon, N.M. de Rothschild and Son; Turin, Ardouin and Co.; Berlin,\nMendelssohn; Geneva, Lombard, Odier, and Co.; Constantinople, Ottoman\nBank; Brussels, J. Lambert; Madrid, Daniel Weisweller; Amsterdam,\nNetherlands Credit Co.; Rome, Torlonia and Co.; Lisbon, Lecesne;\nCopenhagen, Private Bank; Buenos Ayres, Mana Bank; Rio Janeiro, Mana\nBank; Monte Video, Mana Bank; Valparaiso, Thomas La Chambre and Co.;\nLima, Thomas La Chambre and Co.; Mexico, Martin Daran and Co.\n\nThree days after President Barbicane's manifesto 400,000 dollars were\nreceived in the different towns of the Union. With such a sum in hand\nthe Gun Club could begin at once.\n\nBut a few days later telegrams informed America that foreign\nsubscriptions were pouring in rapidly. Certain countries were\ndistinguished by their generosity; others let go their money less\neasily. It was a matter of temperament.\n\nHowever, figures are more eloquent than words, and the following is an\nofficial statement of the sums paid to the credit of the Gun Club when\nthe subscription was closed:--\n\nThe contingent of Russia was the enormous sum of 368,733 roubles. This\nneed astonish no one who remembers the scientific taste of the Russians\nand the impetus which they have given to astronomical studies, thanks to\ntheir numerous observatories, the principal of which cost 2,000,000\nroubles.\n\nFrance began by laughing at the pretensions of the Americans. The moon\nserved as an excuse for a thousand stale puns and a score of vaudevilles\nin which bad taste contested the palm with ignorance. But, as the French\nformerly paid after singing, they now paid after laughing, and\nsubscribed a sum of 1,258,930 francs. At that price they bought the\nright to joke a little.\n\nAustria, in the midst of her financial difficulties, was sufficiently\ngenerous. Her part in the public subscription amounted to 216,000\nflorins, which were welcome.\n\nSweden and Norway contributed 52,000 rix-dollars. The figure was small\nconsidering the country; but it would certainly have been higher if a\nsubscription had been opened at Christiania as well as at Stockholm. For\nsome reason or other the Norwegians do not like to send their money to\nNorway.\n\nPrussia, by sending 250,000 thalers, testified her approbation of the\nenterprise. Her different observatories contributed an important sum,\nand were amongst the most ardent in encouraging President Barbicane.\n\nTurkey behaved generously, but she was personally interested in the\nbusiness; the moon, in fact, rules the course of her years and her\nRamadan fast. She could do no less than give 1,372,640 piastres, and she\ngave them with an ardour that betrayed, however, a certain pressure from\nthe Government of the Porte.\n\nBelgium distinguished herself amongst all the second order of States by\na gift of 513,000 francs, about one penny and a fraction for each\ninhabitant.\n\nHolland and her colonies contributed 110,000 florins, only demanding a\ndiscount of five per cent., as she paid ready money.\n\nDenmark, rather confined for room, gave, notwithstanding, 9,000 ducats,\nproving her love for scientific experiments.\n\nThe Germanic Confederation subscribed 34,285 florins; more could not be\nasked from her; besides, she would not have given more.\n\nAlthough in embarrassed circumstances, Italy found 2,000,000 francs in\nher children's pockets, but by turning them well inside out. If she had\nthen possessed Venetia she would have given more, but she did not yet\npossess Venetia.\n\nThe Pontifical States thought they could not send less than 7,040 Roman\ncrowns, and Portugal pushed her devotion to the extent of 3,000\ncruzades.\n\nMexico gent the widow's mite, 86 piastres; but empires in course of\nformation are always in rather embarrassed circumstances.\n\nSwitzerland sent the modest sum of 257 francs to the American scheme. It\nmust be frankly stated that Switzerland only looked upon the practical\nside of the operation; the action of sending a bullet to the moon did\nnot seem of a nature sufficient for the establishing of any\ncommunication with the Queen of Night, so Switzerland thought it\nimprudent to engage capital in an enterprise depending upon such\nuncertain events. After all, Switzerland was, perhaps, right.\n\nAs to Spain, she found it impossible to get together more than 110\nreals. She gave as an excuse that she had her railways to finish. The\ntruth is that science is not looked upon very favourably in that\ncountry; it is still a little behindhand. And then certain Spaniards,\nand not the most ignorant either, had no clear conception of the size of\nthe projectile compared with that of the moon; they feared it might\ndisturb the satellite from her orbit, and make her fall on to the\nsurface of the terrestrial globe. In that case it was better to have\nnothing to do with it, which they carried out, with that small\nexception.\n\nEngland alone remained. The contemptuous antipathy with which she\nreceived Barbicane's proposition is known. The English have but a single\nmind in their 25,000,000 of bodies which Great Britain contains. They\ngave it to be understood that the enterprise of the Gun Club was\ncontrary \"to the principle of non-intervention,\" and they did not\nsubscribe a single farthing.\n\nAt this news the Gun Club contented itself with shrugging its shoulders,\nand returned to its great work. When South America--that is to say,\nPeru, Chili, Brazil, the provinces of La Plata and Columbia--had poured\ninto their hands their quota of 300,000 dollars, it found itself\npossessed of a considerable capital of which the following is a\nstatement:--\n\nUnited States subscription, 4,000,000 dollars; foreign subscriptions,\n1,446,675 dollars; total, 5,446,675 dollars.\n\nThis was the large sum poured by the public into the coffers of the Gun\nClub.\n\nNo one need be surprised at its importance. The work of casting, boring,\nmasonry, transport of workmen, and their installation in an almost\nuninhabited country, the construction of furnaces and workshops, the\nmanufacturing tools, powder, projectile and incidental expenses would,\naccording to the estimates, absorb nearly the whole. Some of the\ncannon-shots fired during the war cost 1,000 dollars each; that of\nPresident Barbicane, unique in the annals of artillery, might well cost\n5,000 times more.\n\nOn the 20th of October a contract was made with the Goldspring\nManufactory, New York, which during the war had furnished Parrott with\nhis best cast-iron guns.\n\nIt was stipulated between the contracting parties that the Goldspring\nManufactory should pledge itself to send to Tampa Town, in South\nFlorida, the necessary materials for the casting of the Columbiad.\n\nThis operation was to be terminated, at the latest, on the 15th of the\nnext October, and the cannon delivered in good condition, under penalty\nof 100 dollars a day forfeit until the moon should again present herself\nunder the same conditions--that is to say, during eighteen years and\neleven days.\n\nThe engagement of the workmen, their pay, and the necessary transports\nall to be made by the Goldspring Company.\n\nThis contract, made in duplicate, was signed by I. Barbicane, president\nof the Gun Club, and J. Murphison, Manager of the Goldspring\nManufactory, who thus signed on the part of the contracting parties.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nSTONY HILL.\n\n\nSince the choice made by the members of the Gun Club to the detriment of\nTexas, every one in America--where every one knows how to read--made it\nhis business to study the geography of Florida. Never before had the\nbooksellers sold so many _Bertram's Travels in Florida_, _Roman's\nNatural History of East and West Florida_, _Williams' Territory of\nFlorida_, and _Cleland on the Culture of the Sugar Cane in East\nFlorida_. New editions of these works were required. There was quite a\nrage for them.\n\nBarbicane had something better to do than to read; he wished to see with\nhis own eyes and choose the site of the Columbiad. Therefore, without\nlosing a moment, he put the funds necessary for the construction of a\ntelescope at the disposition of the Cambridge Observatory, and made a\ncontract with the firm of Breadwill and Co., of Albany, for the making\nof the aluminium projectile; then he left Baltimore accompanied by J.T.\nMaston, Major Elphinstone, and the manager of the Goldspring\nManufactory.\n\nThe next day the four travelling companions reached New Orleans. There\nthey embarked on board the _Tampico_, a despatch-boat belonging to the\nFederal Navy, which the Government had placed at their disposal, and,\nwith all steam on, they quickly lost sight of the shores of Louisiana.\n\nThe passage was not a long one; two days after its departure the\n_Tampico_, having made four hundred and eighty miles, sighted the\nFloridian coast. As it approached, Barbicane saw a low, flat coast,\nlooking rather unfertile. After coasting a series of creeks rich in\noysters and lobsters, the _Tampico_ entered the Bay of Espiritu-Santo.\n\nThis bay is divided into two long roadsteads, those of Tampa and\nHillisboro, the narrow entrance to which the steamer soon cleared. A\nshort time afterwards the batteries of Fort Brooke rose above the waves\nand the town of Tampa appeared, carelessly lying on a little natural\nharbour formed by the mouth of the river Hillisboro.\n\nThere the _Tampico_ anchored on October 22nd, at seven p.m.; the four\npassengers landed immediately.\n\nBarbicane felt his heart beat violently as he set foot on Floridian\nsoil; he seemed to feel it with his feet like an architect trying the\nsolidity of a house. J.T. Maston scratched the ground with his steel\nhook.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" then said Barbicane, \"we have no time to lose, and we will\nset off on horseback to-morrow to survey the country.\"\n\nThe minute Barbicane landed the three thousand inhabitants of Tampa Town\nwent out to meet him, an honour quite due to the president of the Gun\nClub, who had decided in their favour. They received him with formidable\nexclamations, but Barbicane escaped an ovation by shutting himself up in\nhis room at the Franklin Hotel and refusing to see any one.\n\nThe next day, October 23rd, small horses of Spanish race, full of fire\nand vigour, pawed the ground under his windows. But, instead of four,\nthere were fifty, with their riders. Barbicane went down accompanied by\nhis three companions, who were at first astonished to find themselves in\nthe midst of such a cavalcade. He remarked besides that each horseman\ncarried a carbine slung across his shoulders and pistols in his\nholsters. The reason for such a display of force was immediately given\nhim by a young Floridian, who said to him--\n\n\"Sir, the Seminoles are there.\"\n\n\"What Seminoles?\"\n\n\"Savages who frequent the prairies, and we deemed it prudent to give you\nan escort.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" exclaimed J.T. Maston as he mounted his steed.\n\n\"It is well to be on the safe side,\" answered the Floridian.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied Barbicane, \"I thank you for your attention, and now\nlet us be off.\"\n\nThe little troop set out immediately, and disappeared in a cloud of\ndust. It was five a.m.; the sun shone brilliantly already, and the\nthermometer indicated 84\u00b0, but fresh sea breezes moderated this\nexcessive heat.\n\nBarbicane, on leaving Tampa Town, went down south and followed the coast\nto Alifia Creek. This small river falls into Hillisboro Bay, twelve\nmiles below Tampa Town. Barbicane and his escort followed its right bank\ngoing up towards the east. The waves of the bay disappeared behind an\ninequality in the ground, and the Floridian country was alone in sight.\n\nFlorida is divided into two parts; the one to the north, more populous\nand less abandoned, has Tallahassee for capital, and Pensacola, one of\nthe principal marine arsenals of the United States; the other, lying\nbetween the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, is only a narrow peninsula,\neaten away by the current of the Gulf Stream--a little tongue of land\nlost amidst a small archipelago, which the numerous vessels of the\nBahama Channel double continually. It is the advanced sentinel of the\ngulf of great tempests. The superficial area of this state measures\n38,033,267 acres, amongst which one had to be chosen situated beyond the\n28th parallel and suitable for the enterprise. As Barbicane rode along\nhe attentively examined the configuration of the ground and its\nparticular distribution.\n\nFlorida, discovered by Juan Ponce de Leon in 1512, on Palm Sunday, was\nfirst of all named _Pascha Florida_. It was well worthy of that\ndesignation with its dry and arid coasts. But a few miles from the shore\nthe nature of the ground gradually changed, and the country showed\nitself worthy of its name; the soil was cut up by a network of creeks,\nrivers, watercourses, ponds, and small lakes; it might have been\nmistaken for Holland or Guiana; but the ground gradually rose and soon\nshowed its cultivated plains, where all the vegetables of the North and\nSouth grow in perfection, its immense fields, where a tropical sun and\nthe water conserved in its clayey texture do all the work of\ncultivating, and lastly its prairies of pineapples, yams, tobacco, rice,\ncotton, and sugarcanes, which extended as far as the eye could reach,\nspreading out their riches with careless prodigality.\n\nBarbicane appeared greatly satisfied on finding the progressive\nelevation of the ground, and when J.T. Maston questioned him on the\nsubject,\n\n\"My worthy friend,\" said he, \"it is greatly to our interest to cast our\nColumbiad on elevated ground.\"\n\n\"In order to be nearer the moon?\" exclaimed the secretary of the Gun\nClub.\n\n\"No,\" answered Barbicane, smiling. \"What can a few yards more or less\nmatter? No, but on elevated ground our work can be accomplished more\neasily; we shall not have to struggle against water, which will save us\nlong and expensive tubings, and that has to be taken into consideration\nwhen a well 900 feet deep has to be sunk.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said Murchison, the engineer; \"we must, as much as\npossible, avoid watercourses during the casting; but if we meet with\nsprings they will not matter much; we can exhaust them with our machines\nor divert them from their course. Here we have not to work at an\nartesian well, narrow and dark, where all the boring implements have to\nwork in the dark. No; we can work under the open sky, with spade and\npickaxe, and, by the help of blasting, our work will not take long.\"\n\n\"Still,\" resumed Barbicane, \"if by the elevation of the ground or its\nnature we can avoid a struggle with subterranean waters, we can do our\nwork more rapidly and perfectly; we must, therefore, make our cutting in\nground situated some thousands of feet above the level of the sea.\"\n\n\"You are right, Mr. Barbicane, and, if I am not mistaken, we shall soon\nfind a suitable spot.\"\n\n\"I should like to see the first spadeful turned up,\" said the president.\n\n\"And I the last!\" exclaimed J.T. Maston.\n\n\"We shall manage it, gentlemen,\" answered the engineer; \"and, believe\nme, the Goldspring Company will not have to pay you any forfeit for\ndelay.\"\n\n\"Faith! it had better not,\" replied J.T. Maston; \"a hundred dollars a\nday till the moon presents herself in the same conditions--that is to\nsay, for eighteen years and eleven days--do you know that would make\n658,000 dollars?\"\n\n\"No, sir, we do not know, and we shall not need to learn.\"\n\nAbout ten a.m. the little troop had journeyed about twelve miles; to the\nfertile country succeeded a forest region. There were the most varied\nperfumes in tropical profusion. The almost impenetrable forests were\nmade up of pomegranates, orange, citron, fig, olive, and apricot trees,\nbananas, huge vines, the blossoms and fruit of which rivalled each other\nin colour and perfume. Under the perfumed shade of these magnificent\ntrees sang and fluttered a world of brilliantly-coloured birds, amongst\nwhich the crab-eater deserved a jewel casket, worthy of its feathered\ngems, for a nest.\n\nJ.T. Maston and the major could not pass through such opulent nature\nwithout admiring its splendid beauty.\n\nBut President Barbicane, who thought little of these marvels, was in a\nhurry to hasten onwards; this country, so fertile, displeased him by its\nvery fertility; without being otherwise hydropical, he felt water under\nhis feet, and sought in vain the signs of incontestable aridity.\n\nIn the meantime they journeyed on. They were obliged to ford several\nrivers, and not without danger, for they were infested with alligators\nfrom fifteen to eighteen feet long. J.T. Maston threatened them boldly\nwith his formidable hook, but he only succeeded in frightening the\npelicans, phaetons, and teals that frequented the banks, while the red\nflamingoes looked on with a stupid stare.\n\nAt last these inhabitants of humid countries disappeared in their turn.\nThe trees became smaller and more thinly scattered in smaller woods;\nsome isolated groups stood amidst immense plains where ranged herds of\nstartled deer.\n\n\"At last!\" exclaimed Barbicane, rising in his stirrups. \"Here is the\nregion of pines.\"\n\n\"And savages,\" answered the major.\n\nIn fact, a few Seminoles appeared on the horizon. They moved about\nbackwards and forwards on their fleet horses, brandishing long lances or\nfiring their guns with a dull report. However, they confined themselves\nto these hostile demonstrations, which had no effect on Barbicane and\nhis companions.\n\nThey were then in the middle of a rocky plain, a vast open space of\nseveral acres in extent which the sun covered with burning rays. It was\nformed by a wide elevation of the soil, and seemed to offer to the\nmembers of the Gun Club all the required conditions for the construction\nof their Columbiad.\n\n\"Halt!\" cried Barbicane, stopping. \"Has this place any name?\"\n\n\"It is called Stony Hill,\" answered the Floridians.\n\nBarbicane, without saying a word, dismounted, took his instruments, and\nbegan to fix his position with extreme precision. The little troop drawn\nup around him watched him in profound silence.\n\nAt that moment the sun passed the meridian. Barbicane, after an\ninterval, rapidly noted the result of his observation, and said--\n\n\"This place is situated 1,800 feet above the sea level in lat. 27\u00b0 7'\nand West long. 5\u00b0 7' by the Washington meridian. It appears to me by its\nbarren and rocky nature to offer every condition favourable to our\nenterprise; we will therefore raise our magazines, workshops, furnaces,\nand workmen's huts here, and it is from this very spot,\" said he,\nstamping upon it with his foot, \"the summit of Stony Hill, that our\nprojectile will start for the regions of the solar world!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nPICKAXE AND TROWEL.\n\n\nThat same evening Barbicane and his companions returned to Tampa Town,\nand Murchison, the engineer, re-embarked on board the _Tampico_ for New\nOrleans. He was to engage an army of workmen to bring back the greater\npart of the working-stock. The members of the Gun Club remained at Tampa\nTown in order to set on foot the preliminary work with the assistance of\nthe inhabitants of the country.\n\nEight days after its departure the _Tampico_ returned to the\nEspiritu-Santo Bay with a fleet of steamboats. Murchison had succeeded\nin getting together 1,500 workmen. In the evil days of slavery he would\nhave lost his time and trouble; but since America, the land of liberty,\nhas only contained freemen, they flock wherever they can get good pay.\nNow money was not wanting to the Gun Club; it offered a high rate of\nwages with considerable and proportionate perquisites. The workman\nenlisted for Florida could, once the work finished, depend upon a\ncapital placed in his name in the bank of Baltimore.\n\nMurchison had therefore only to pick and choose, and could be severe\nabout the intelligence and skill of his workmen. He enrolled in his\nworking legion the pick of mechanics, stokers, iron-founders,\nlime-burners, miners, brickmakers, and artisans of every sort, white or\nblack without distinction of colour. Many of them brought their families\nwith them. It was quite an emigration.\n\nOn the 31st of October, at 10 a.m., this troop landed on the quays of\nTampa Town. The movement and activity which reigned in the little town\nthat had thus doubled its population in a single day may be imagined. In\nfact, Tampa Town was enormously benefited by this enterprise of the Gun\nClub, not by the number of workmen who were immediately drafted to Stony\nHill, but by the influx of curious idlers who converged by degrees from\nall points of the globe towards the Floridian peninsula.\n\nDuring the first few days they were occupied in unloading the flotilla\nof the tools, machines, provisions, and a large number of plate iron\nhouses made in pieces separately pieced and numbered. At the same time\nBarbicane laid the first sleepers of a railway fifteen miles long that\nwas destined to unite Stony Hill and Tampa Town.\n\nIt is known how American railways are constructed, with capricious\nbends, bold slopes, steep hills, and deep valleys. They do not cost much\nand are not much in their way, only their trains run off or jump off as\nthey please. The railway from Tampa Town to Stony Hill was but a trifle,\nand wanted neither much time nor much money for its construction.\n\nBarbicane was the soul of this army of workmen who had come at his call.\nHe animated them, communicated to them his ardour, enthusiasm, and\nconviction. He was everywhere at once, as if endowed with the gift of\nubiquity, and always followed by J.T. Maston, his bluebottle fly. His\npractical mind invented a thousand things. With him there were no\nobstacles, difficulties, or embarrassment. He was as good a miner,\nmason, and mechanic as he was an artilleryman, having an answer to every\nquestion, and a solution to every problem. He corresponded actively with\nthe Gun Club and the Goldspring Manufactory, and day and night the\n_Tampico_ kept her steam up awaiting his orders in Hillisboro harbour.\n\nBarbicane, on the 1st of November, left Tampa Town with a detachment of\nworkmen, and the very next day a small town of workmen's houses rose\nround Stony Hill. They surrounded it with palisades, and from its\nmovement and ardour it might soon have been taken for one of the great\ncities of the Union. Life was regulated at once and work began in\nperfect order.\n\nCareful boring had established the nature of the ground, and digging was\nbegun on November 4th. That day Barbicane called his foremen together\nand said to them--\n\n\"You all know, my friends, why I have called you together in this part\nof Florida. We want to cast a cannon nine feet in diameter, six feet\nthick, and with a stone revetment nineteen and a half feet thick; we\ntherefore want a well 60 feet wide and 900 feet deep. This large work\nmust be terminated in nine months. You have, therefore, 2,543,400 cubic\nfeet of soil to dig out in 255 days--that is to say, 10,000 cubic feet a\nday. That would offer no difficulty if you had plenty of elbow-room, but\nas you will only have a limited space it will be more trouble.\nNevertheless as the work must be done it will be done, and I depend upon\nyour courage as much as upon your skill.\"\n\nAt 8 a.m. the first spadeful was dug out of the Floridian soil, and from\nthat moment this useful tool did not stop idle a moment in the hands of\nthe miner. The gangs relieved each other every three hours.\n\nBesides, although the work was colossal it did not exceed the limit of\nhuman capability. Far from that. How many works of much greater\ndifficulty, and in which the elements had to be more directly contended\nagainst, had been brought to a successful termination! Suffice it to\nmention the well of Father Joseph, made near Cairo by the Sultan Saladin\nat an epoch when machines had not yet appeared to increase the strength\nof man a hundredfold, and which goes down to the level of the Nile\nitself at a depth of 300 feet! And that other well dug at Coblentz by\nthe Margrave Jean of Baden, 600 feet deep! All that was needed was a\ntriple depth and a double width, which made the boring easier. There was\nnot one foreman or workman who doubted about the success of the\noperation.\n\nAn important decision taken by Murchison and approved of by Barbicane\naccelerated the work. An article in the contract decided that the\nColumbiad should be hooped with wrought-iron--a useless precaution, for\nthe cannon could evidently do without hoops. This clause was therefore\ngiven up. Hence a great economy of time, for they could then employ the\nnew system of boring now used for digging wells, by which the masonry is\ndone at the same time as the boring. Thanks to this very simple\noperation they were not obliged to prop up the ground; the wall kept it\nup and went down by its own weight.\n\nThis manoeuvre was only to begin when the spade should have reached the\nsolid part of the ground.\n\nOn the 4th of November fifty workmen began to dig in the very centre of\nthe inclosure surrounded by palisades--that is to say, the top of Stony\nHill--a circular hole sixty feet wide.\n\nThe spade first turned up a sort of black soil six inches deep, which it\nsoon carried away. To this soil succeeded two feet of fine sand, which\nwas carefully taken out, as it was to be used for the casting.\n\nAfter this sand white clay appeared, similar to English chalk, and which\nwas four feet thick.\n\nThen the pickaxes rang upon the hard layer, a species of rock formed by\nvery dry petrified shells. At that point the hole was six and a half\nfeet deep, and the masonry was begun.\n\nAt the bottom of that excavation they made an oak wheel, a sort of\ncircle strongly bolted and of enormous strength; in its centre a hole\nwas pierced the size of the exterior diameter of the Columbiad. It was\nupon this wheel that the foundations of the masonry were placed, the\nhydraulic cement of which joined the stones solidly together. After the\nworkmen had bricked up the space from the circumference to the centre,\nthey found themselves inclosed in a well twenty-one feet wide.\n\nWhen this work was ended the miners began again with spade and pickaxe,\nand set upon the rock under the wheel itself, taking care to support it\non extremely strong tressels; every time the hole was two feet deeper\nthey took away the tressels; the wheel gradually sank, taking with it\nits circle of masonry, at the upper layer of which the masons worked\nincessantly, taking care to make vent-holes for the escape of gas during\nthe operation of casting.\n\nThis kind of work required great skill and constant attention on the\npart of the workmen; more than one digging under the wheel was\ndangerous, and some were even mortally wounded by the splinters of\nstone; but their energy did not slacken for a moment by day nor night;\nby day, when the sun's rays sent the thermometer up to 99\u00b0 on the\ncalcined planes; by night, under the white waves of electric light, the\nnoise of the pickaxe on the rock, the blasting and the machines,\ntogether with the wreaths of smoke scattered through the air, traced a\ncircle of terror round Stony Hill, which the herds of buffaloes and the\ndetachments of Seminoles never dared to pass.\n\nIn the meantime the work regularly advanced; steam-cranes speeded the\ncarrying away of the rubbish; of unexpected obstacles there were none;\nall the difficulties had been foreseen and guarded against.\n\nWhen the first month had gone by the well had attained the depth\nassigned for the time--i.e., 112 feet. In December this depth was\ndoubled, and tripled in January. During February the workmen had to\ncontend against a sheet of water which sprang from the ground. They were\nobliged to employ powerful pumps and apparatus of compressed air to\ndrain it off, so as to close up the orifice from which it issued, just\nas leaks are caulked on board ship. At last they got the better of these\nunwelcome springs, only in consequence of the loosening of the soil the\nwheel partially gave way, and there was a landslip. The frightful force\nof this bricked circle, more than 400 feet high, may be imagined! This\naccident cost the life of several workmen. Three weeks had to be taken\nup in propping the stone revetment and making the wheel solid again.\nBut, thanks to the skill of the engineer and the power of the machines,\nit was all set right, and the boring continued.\n\nNo fresh incident henceforth stopped the progress of the work, and on\nthe 10th of June, twenty days before the expiration of the delay fixed\nby Barbicane, the well, quite bricked round, had reached the depth of\n900 feet. At the bottom the masonry rested upon a massive block, thirty\nfeet thick, whilst at the top it was on a level with the soil.\n\nPresident Barbicane and the members of the Gun Club warmly congratulated\nthe engineer Murchison; his cyclopean work had been accomplished with\nextraordinary rapidity.\n\nDuring these eight months Barbicane did not leave Stony Hill for a\nminute; whilst he narrowly watched over the boring operations, he took\nevery precaution to insure the health and well-being of his workmen, and\nhe was fortunate enough to avoid the epidemics common to large\nagglomerations of men, and so disastrous in those regions of the globe\nexposed to tropical influence.\n\nIt is true that several workmen paid with their lives for the\ncarelessness engendered by these dangerous occupations; but such\ndeplorable misfortunes cannot be avoided, and these are details that\nAmericans pay very little attention to. They are more occupied with\nhumanity in general than with individuals in particular. However,\nBarbicane professed the contrary principles, and applied them upon every\noccasion. Thanks to his care, to his intelligence and respectful\nintervention in difficult cases, to his prodigious and humane wisdom,\nthe average of catastrophes did not exceed that of cities on the other\nside of the Atlantic, amongst others those of France, where they count\nabout one accident upon every 200,000 francs of work.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nTHE CEREMONY OF THE CASTING.\n\n\nDuring the eight months that were employed in the operation of boring\nthe preparatory works of the casting had been conducted simultaneously\nwith extreme rapidity; a stranger arriving at Stony Hill would have been\nmuch surprised at what he saw there.\n\nSix hundred yards from the well, and standing in a circle round it as a\ncentral point, were 1,200 furnaces, each six feet wide and three yards\napart. The line made by these 1,200 furnaces was two miles long. They\nwere all built on the same model, with high quadrangular chimneys, and\nhad a singular effect. J.T. Maston thought the architectural arrangement\nsuperb. It reminded him of the monuments at Washington. He thought there\nwas nothing finer in the world, not even in Greece, where he\nacknowledged never to have been.\n\nIt will be remembered that at their third meeting the committee decided\nto use cast-iron for the Columbiad, and in particular the grey\ndescription. This metal is, in fact, the most tenacious, ductile, and\nmalleable, suitable for all moulding operations, and when smelted with\npit coal it is of superior quality for engine-cylinders, hydraulic\npresses, &c.\n\nBut cast-iron, if it has undergone a single fusion, is rarely\nhomogeneous enough; and it is by means of a second fusion that it is\npurified, refined, and dispossessed of its last earthly deposits.\n\nBefore being forwarded to Tampa Town, the iron ore, smelted in the great\nfurnaces of Goldspring, and put in contact with coal and silicium heated\nto a high temperature, was transformed into cast-iron. After this first\noperation the metal was taken to Stony Hill. But there were 136 millions\nof pounds of cast-iron, a bulk too expensive to be sent by railway; the\nprice of transport would have doubled that of the raw material. It\nappeared preferable to freight vessels at New York and to load them with\nthe iron in bars; no less than sixty-eight vessels of 1,000 tons were\nrequired, quite a fleet, which on May 3rd left New York, took the Ocean\nroute, coasted the American shores, entered the Bahama Channel, doubled\nthe point of Florida, and on the 10th of the same month entered the Bay\nof Espiritu-Santo and anchored safely in the port of Tampa Town. There\nthe vessels were unloaded and their cargo carried by railway to Stony\nHill, and about the middle of January the enormous mass of metal was\ndelivered at its destination.\n\nIt will easily be understood that 1,200 furnaces were not too many to\nmelt these 60,000 tons of iron simultaneously. Each of these furnaces\ncontained about 1,400,000 lbs. of metal; they had been built on the\nmodel of those used for the casting of the Rodman gun; they were\ntrapezoidal in form, with a high elliptical arch. The warming apparatus\nand the chimney were placed at the two extremities of the furnace, so\nthat it was equally heated throughout. These furnaces, built of\nfireproof brick, were filled with coal-grates and a \"sole\" for the bars\nof iron; this sole, inclosed at an angle of 25\u00b0, allowed the metal to\nflow into the receiving-troughs; from thence 1,200 converging trenches\ncarried it down to the central well.\n\nThe day following that upon which the works of masonry and casting were\nterminated, Barbicane set to work upon the interior mould; his object\nnow was to raise in the centre of the well, with a coincident axis, a\ncylinder 900 feet high and nine in diameter, to exactly fill up the\nspace reserved for the bore of the Columbiad. This cylinder was made of\na mixture of clay and sand, with the addition of hay and straw. The\nspace left between the mould and the masonry was to be filled with the\nmolten metal, which would thus make the sides of the cannon six feet\nthick.\n\nThis cylinder, in order to have its equilibrium maintained, had to be\nconsolidated with iron bands and fixed at intervals by means of\ncross-clamps fastened into the stone lining; after the casting these\nclamps would be lost in the block of metal, which would not be the worse\nfor them.\n\nThis operation was completed on the 8th of July, and the casting was\nfixed for the 10th.\n\n\"The casting will be a fine ceremony,\" said J.T. Maston to his friend\nBarbicane.\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" answered Barbicane, \"but it will not be a public one!\"\n\n\"What! you will not open the doors of the inclosure to all comers?\"\n\n\"Certainly not; the casting of the Columbiad is a delicate, not to say a\ndangerous, operation, and I prefer that it should be done with closed\ndoors. When the projectile is discharged you may have a public ceremony\nif you like, but till then, no!\"\n\nThe president was right; the operation might be attended with unforeseen\ndanger, which a large concourse of spectators would prevent being\naverted. It was necessary to preserve complete freedom of movement. No\none was admitted into the inclosure except a delegation of members of\nthe Gun Club who made the voyage to Tampa Town. Among them was the brisk\nBilsby, Tom Hunter, Colonel Blomsberry, Major Elphinstone, General\nMorgan, and _tutti quanti_, to whom the casting of the Columbiad was a\npersonal business. J.T. Maston constituted himself their cicerone; he\ndid not excuse them any detail; he led them about everywhere, through\nthe magazines, workshops, amongst the machines, and he forced them to\nvisit the 1,200 furnaces one after the other. At the end of the 1,200th\nvisit they were rather sick of it.\n\nThe casting was to take place precisely at twelve o'clock; the evening\nbefore each furnace had been charged with 114,000 lbs. of metal in bars\ndisposed crossway to each other so that the warm air could circulate\nfreely amongst them. Since early morning the 1,200 chimneys had been\npouring forth volumes of flames into the atmosphere, and the soil was\nshaken convulsively. There were as many pounds of coal to be burnt as\nmetal to be melted. There were, therefore, 68,000 tons of coal throwing\nup before the sun a thick curtain of black smoke.\n\nThe heat soon became unbearable in the circle of furnaces, the rambling\nof which resembled the rolling of thunder; powerful bellows added their\ncontinuous blasts, and saturated the incandescent furnaces with oxygen.\n\nThe operation of casting in order to succeed must be done rapidly. At a\nsignal given by a cannon-shot each furnace was to pour out the liquid\niron and to be entirely emptied.\n\nThese arrangements made, foremen and workmen awaited the preconcerted\nmoment with impatience mixed with emotion. There was no longer any one\nin the inclosure, and each superintendent took his place near the\naperture of the run.\n\nBarbicane and his colleagues, installed on a neighbouring eminence,\nassisted at the operation. Before them a cannon was planted ready to be\nfired as a sign from the engineer.\n\nA few minutes before twelve the first drops of metal began to run; the\nreservoirs were gradually filled, and when the iron was all in a liquid\nstate it was left quiet for some instants in order to facilitate the\nseparation of foreign substances.\n\nTwelve o'clock struck. The cannon was suddenly fired, and shot its flame\ninto the air. Twelve hundred tapping-holes were opened simultaneously,\nand twelve hundred fiery serpents crept along twelve hundred troughs\ntowards the central well, rolling in rings of fire. There they plunged\nwith terrific noise down a depth of 900 feet. It was an exciting and\nmagnificent spectacle. The ground trembled, whilst these waves of iron,\nthrowing into the sky their clouds of smoke, evaporated at the same time\nthe humidity of the mould, and hurled it upwards through the vent-holes\nof the masonry in the form of impenetrable vapour. These artificial\nclouds unrolled their thick spirals as they went up to a height of 3,000\nfeet into the air. Any Red Indian wandering upon the limits of the\nhorizon might have believed in the formation of a new crater in the\nheart of Florida, and yet it was neither an irruption, nor a typhoon,\nnor a storm, nor a struggle of the elements, nor one of those terrible\nphenomena which Nature is capable of producing. No; man alone had\nproduced those reddish vapours, those gigantic flames worthy of a\nvolcano, those tremendous vibrations like the shock of an earthquake,\nthose reverberations, rivals of hurricanes and storms, and it was his\nhand which hurled into an abyss, dug by himself, a whole Niagara of\nmolten metal!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nTHE COLUMBIAD.\n\n\nHad the operation of casting succeeded? People were reduced to mere\nconjecture. However, there was every reason to believe in its success,\nas the mould had absorbed the entire mass of metal liquefied in the\nfurnaces. Still it was necessarily a long time impossible to be certain.\n\nIn fact, when Major Rodman cast his cannon of 160,000 lbs., it took no\nless than a fortnight to cool. How long, therefore, would the monstrous\nColumbiad, crowned with its clouds of vapour, and guarded by its intense\nheat, be kept from the eyes of its admirers? It was difficult to\nestimate.\n\nThe impatience of the members of the Gun Club was put to a rude test\nduring this lapse of time. But it could not be helped. J.T. Maston was\nnearly roasted through his anxiety. A fortnight after the casting an\nimmense column of smoke was still soaring towards the sky, and the\nground burnt the soles of the feet within a radius of 200 feet round the\nsummit of Stony Hill.\n\nThe days went by; weeks followed them. There were no means of cooling\nthe immense cylinder. It was impossible to approach it. The members of\nthe Gun Club were obliged to wait with what patience they could muster.\n\n\"Here we are at the 10th of August,\" said J.T. Maston one morning. \"It\nwants hardly four months to the 1st of December! There still remains the\ninterior mould to be taken out, and the Columbiad to be loaded! We never\nshall be ready! One cannot even approach the cannon! Will it never get\ncool? That would be a cruel deception!\"\n\nThey tried to calm the impatient secretary without succeeding. Barbicane\nsaid nothing, but his silence covered serious irritation. To see himself\nstopped by an obstacle that time alone could remove--time, an enemy to\nbe feared under the circumstances--and to be in the power of an enemy\nwas hard for men of war.\n\nHowever, daily observations showed a certain change in the state of the\nground. Towards the 15th of August the vapour thrown off had notably\ndiminished in intensity and thickness. A few days after the earth only\nexhaled a slight puff of smoke, the last breath of the monster shut up\nin its stone tomb. By degrees the vibrations of the ground ceased, and\nthe circle of heat contracted; the most impatient of the spectators\napproached; one day they gained ten feet, the next twenty, and on the\n22nd of August Barbicane, his colleagues, and the engineer could take\ntheir place on the cast-iron surface which covered the summit of Stony\nHill, certainly a very healthy spot, where it was not yet allowed to\nhave cold feet.\n\n\"At last!\" cried the president of the Gun Club with an immense sigh of\nsatisfaction.\n\nThe works were resumed the same day. The extraction of the interior\nmould was immediately proceeded with in order to clear out the bore;\npickaxes, spades, and boring-tools were set to work without\nintermission; the clay and sand had become exceedingly hard under the\naction of the heat; but by the help of machines they cleared away the\nmixture still burning at its contact with the iron; the rubbish was\nrapidly carted away on the railway, and the work was done with such\nspirit, Barbicane's intervention was so urgent, and his arguments,\npresented under the form of dollars, carried so much conviction, that on\nthe 3rd of September all trace of the mould had disappeared.\n\nThe operation of boring was immediately begun; the boring-machines were\nset up without delay, and a few weeks later the interior surface of the\nimmense tube was perfectly cylindrical, and the bore had acquired a high\npolish.\n\nAt last, on the 22nd of September, less than a year after the Barbicane\ncommunication, the enormous weapon, raised by means of delicate\ninstruments, and quite vertical, was ready for use. There was nothing\nbut the moon to wait for, but they were sure she would not fail.\n\nJ.T. Maston's joy knew no bounds, and he nearly had a frightful fall\nwhilst looking down the tube of 900 feet. Without Colonel Blomsberry's\nright arm, which he had happily preserved, the secretary of the Gun\nClub, like a modern Erostatus, would have found a grave in the depths of\nthe Columbiad.\n\nThe cannon was then finished; there was no longer any possible doubt as\nto its perfect execution; so on the 6th of October Captain Nicholl\ncleared off his debt to President Barbicane, who inscribed in his\nreceipt-column a sum of 2,000 dollars. It may be believed that the\ncaptain's anger reached its highest pitch, and cost him an illness.\nStill there were yet three bets of 3,000, 4,000, and 5,000 dollars, and\nif he only gained 2,000, his bargain would not be a bad one, though not\nexcellent. But money did not enter into his calculations, and the\nsuccess obtained by his rival in the casting of a cannon against which\niron plates sixty feet thick would not have resisted was a terrible blow\nto him.\n\nSince the 23rd of September the inclosure on Stony Hill had been quite\nopen to the public, and the concourse of visitors will be readily\nimagined.\n\nIn fact, innumerable people from all points of the United States flocked\nto Florida. The town of Tampa was prodigiously increased during that\nyear, consecrated entirely to the works of the Gun Club; it then\ncomprised a population of 150,000 souls. After having surrounded Fort\nBrooke in a network of streets it was now being lengthened out on that\ntongue of land which separated the two harbours of Espiritu-Santo Bay;\nnew quarters, new squares, and a whole forest of houses had grown up in\nthese formerly-deserted regions under the heat of the American sun.\nCompanies were formed for the erection of churches, schools, private\ndwellings, and in less than a year the size of the town was increased\ntenfold.\n\nIt is well known that Yankees are born business men; everywhere that\ndestiny takes them, from the glacial to the torrid zone, their instinct\nfor business is usefully exercised. That is why simple visitors to\nFlorida for the sole purpose of following the operations of the Gun Club\nallowed themselves to be involved in commercial operations as soon as\nthey were installed in Tampa Town. The vessels freighted for the\ntransport of the metal and the workmen had given unparalleled activity\nto the port. Soon other vessels of every form and tonnage, freighted\nwith provisions and merchandise, ploughed the bay and the two harbours;\nvast offices of shipbrokers and merchants were established in the town,\nand the _Shipping Gazette_ each day published fresh arrivals in the port\nof Tampa.\n\nWhilst roads were multiplied round the town, in consequence of the\nprodigious increase in its population and commerce, it was joined by\nrailway to the Southern States of the Union. One line of rails connected\nLa Mobile to Pensacola, the great southern maritime arsenal; thence from\nthat important point it ran to Tallahassee. There already existed there\na short line, twenty-one miles long, to Saint Marks on the seashore. It\nwas this loop-line that was prolonged as far as Tampa Town, awakening in\nits passage the dead or sleeping portions of Central Florida. Thus\nTampa, thanks to these marvels of industry due to the idea born one line\nday in the brain of one man, could take as its right the airs of a large\ntown. They surnamed it \"Moon-City,\" and the capital of Florida suffered\nan eclipse visible from all points of the globe.\n\nEvery one will now understand why the rivalry was so great between Texas\nand Florida, and the irritation of the Texicans when they saw their\npretensions set aside by the Gun Club. In their long-sighted sagacity\nthey had foreseen what a country might gain from the experiment\nattempted by Barbicane, and the wealth that would accompany such a\ncannon-shot. Texas lost a vast centre of commerce, railways, and a\nconsiderable increase of population. All these advantages had been given\nto that miserable Floridian peninsula, thrown like a pier between the\nwaves of the Gulf and those of the Atlantic Ocean. Barbicane, therefore,\ndivided with General Santa-Anna the Texan antipathy.\n\nHowever, though given up to its commercial and industrial fury, the new\npopulation of Tampa Town took care not to forget the interesting\noperations of the Gun Club. On the contrary, the least details of the\nenterprise, every blow of the pickaxe, interested them. There was an\nincessant flow of people to and from Tampa Town to Stony Hill--a perfect\nprocession, or, better still, a pilgrimage.\n\nIt was already easy to foresee that the day of the experiment the\nconcourse of spectators would be counted by millions, for they came\nalready from all points of the earth to the narrow peninsula. Europe was\nemigrating to America.\n\nBut until then, it must be acknowledged, the curiosity of the numerous\narrivals had only been moderately satisfied. Many counted upon seeing\nthe casting who only saw the smoke from it. This was not much for hungry\neyes, but Barbicane would allow no one to see that operation. Thereupon\nensued grumbling, discontent, and murmurs; they blamed the president for\nwhat they considered dictatorial conduct. His act was stigmatised as\n\"un-American.\" There was nearly a riot round Stony Hill, but Barbicane\nwas not to be moved. When, however, the Columbiad was quite finished,\nthis state of closed doors could no longer be kept up; besides, it would\nhave been in bad taste, and even imprudent, to offend public opinion.\nBarbicane, therefore, opened the inclosure to all comers; but, in\naccordance with his practical character, he determined to coin money out\nof the public curiosity.\n\nIt was, indeed, something to even be allowed to see this immense\nColumbiad, but to descend into its depths seemed to the Americans the\n_ne plus ultra_ of earthly felicity. In consequence there was not one\nvisitor who was not willing to give himself the pleasure of visiting the\ninterior of this metallic abyss. Baskets hung from steam-cranes allowed\nthem to satisfy their curiosity. It became a perfect mania. Women,\nchildren, and old men all made it their business to penetrate the\nmysteries of the colossal gun. The price for the descent was fixed at\nfive dollars a head, and, notwithstanding this high charge, during the\ntwo months that preceded the experiment, the influx of visitors allowed\nthe Gun Club to pocket nearly 500,000 dollars!\n\nIt need hardly be said that the first visitors to the Columbiad were the\nmembers of the Gun Club. This privilege was justly accorded to that\nillustrious body. The ceremony of reception took place on the 25th of\nSeptember. A basket of honour took down the president, J.T. Maston,\nMajor Elphinstone, General Morgan, Colonel Blomsberry, and other members\nof the Gun Club, ten in all. How hot they were at the bottom of that\nlong metal tube! They were nearly stifled, but how delightful--how\nexquisite! A table had been laid for ten on the massive stone which\nformed the bottom of the Columbiad, and was lighted by a jet of electric\nlight as bright as day itself. Numerous exquisite dishes, that seemed to\ndescend from heaven, were successively placed before the guests, and the\nrichest wines of France flowed profusely during this splendid repast,\ngiven 900 feet below the surface of the earth!\n\nThe festival was a gay, not to say a noisy one. Toasts were given and\nreplied to. They drank to the earth and her satellite, to the Gun Club,\nthe Union, the Moon, Diana, Phoebe, Selene, \"the peaceful courier of the\nnight.\" All the hurrahs, carried up by the sonorous waves of the immense\nacoustic tube, reached its mouth with a noise of thunder; then the\nmultitude round Stony Hill heartily united their shouts to those of the\nten revellers hidden from sight in the depths of the gigantic Columbiad.\n\nJ.T. Maston could contain himself no longer. Whether he shouted or ate,\ngesticulated or talked most would be difficult to determine. Any way he\nwould not have given up his place for an empire, \"not even if the\ncannon--loaded, primed, and fired at that very moment--were to blow him\nin pieces into the planetary universe.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nA TELEGRAM.\n\n\nThe great work undertaken by the Gun Club was now virtually ended, and\nyet two months would still elapse before the day the projectile would\nstart for the moon. These two months would seem as long as two years to\nthe universal impatience. Until then the smallest details of each\noperation had appeared in the newspapers every day, and were eagerly\ndevoured by the public, but now it was to be feared that this \"interest\ndividend\" would be much diminished, and every one was afraid of no\nlonger receiving his daily share of emotions.\n\nThey were all agreeably disappointed: the most unexpected,\nextraordinary, incredible, and improbable incident happened in time to\nkeep up the general excitement to its highest pitch.\n\nOn September 30th, at 3.47 p.m., a telegram, transmitted through the\nAtlantic Cable, arrived at Tampa Town for President Barbicane.\n\nHe tore open the envelope and read the message, and, notwithstanding his\ngreat self-control, his lips grew pale and his eyes dim as he read the\ntelegram.\n\nThe following is the text of the message stored in the archives of the\nGun Club:--\n\n\"France, Paris,\n\n\"September 30th, 4 a.m.\n\n\"Barbicane, Tampa Town, Florida, United States.\n\n\"Substitute a cylindro-conical projectile for your spherical shell.\nShall go inside. Shall arrive by steamer _Atlanta_.\n\n\"MICHEL ARDAN.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nTHE PASSENGER OF THE ATLANTA.\n\n\nIf this wonderful news, instead of coming by telegraph, had simply\narrived by post and in a sealed envelope--if the French, Irish,\nNewfoundland, and American telegraph clerks had not necessarily been\nacquainted with it--Barbicane would not have hesitated for a moment. He\nwould have been quite silent about it for prudence' sake, and in order\nnot to throw discredit on his work. This telegram might be a practical\njoke, especially as it came from a Frenchman. What probability could\nthere be that any man should conceive the idea of such a journey? And if\nthe man did exist was he not a madman who would have to be inclosed in a\nstrait-waistcoat instead of in a cannon-ball?\n\nBut the message was known, and Michel Ardan's proposition was already\nall over the States of the Union, so Barbicane had no reason for\nsilence. He therefore called together his colleagues then in Tampa Town,\nand, without showing what he thought about it or saying a word about the\ndegree of credibility the telegram deserved, he read coldly the laconic\ntext.\n\n\"Not possible!\"--\"Unheard of!\"--\"They are laughing at\nus!\"--\"Ridiculous!\"--\"Absurd!\" Every sort of expression for doubt,\nincredulity, and folly was heard for some minutes with accompaniment of\nappropriate gestures. J.T. Maston alone uttered the words:--\n\n\"That's an idea!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the major, \"but if people have such ideas as that they\nought not to think of putting them into execution.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" quickly answered the secretary of the Gun Club, ready for an\nargument. But the subject was let drop.\n\nIn the meantime Michel Ardan's name was already going about Tampa Town.\nStrangers and natives talked and joked together, not about the\nEuropean--evidently a mythical personage--but about J.T. Maston, who had\nthe folly to believe in his existence. When Barbicane proposed to send a\nprojectile to the moon every one thought the enterprise natural and\npracticable--a simple affair of ballistics. But that a reasonable being\nshould offer to go the journey inside the projectile was a farce, or, to\nuse a familiar Americanism, it was all \"humbug.\"\n\nThis laughter lasted till evening throughout the Union, an unusual thing\nin a country where any impossible enterprise finds adepts and partisans.\n\nStill Michel Ardan's proposition did not fail to awaken a certain\nemotion in many minds. \"They had not thought of such a thing.\" How many\nthings denied one day had become realities the next! Why should not this\njourney be accomplished one day or another? But, any way, the man who\nwould run such a risk must be a madman, and certainly, as his project\ncould not be taken seriously, he would have done better to be quiet\nabout it, instead of troubling a whole population with such ridiculous\ntrash.\n\nBut, first of all, did this personage really exist? That was the great\nquestion. The name of \"Michel Ardan\" was not altogether unknown in\nAmerica. It belonged to a European much talked about for his audacious\nenterprises. Then the telegram sent all across the depths of the\nAtlantic, the designation of the ship upon which the Frenchman had\ndeclared he had taken his passage, the date assigned for his\narrival--all these circumstances gave to the proposition a certain air\nof probability. They were obliged to disburden their minds about it.\nSoon these isolated individuals formed into groups, the groups became\ncondensed under the action of curiosity like atoms by virtue of\nmolecular attraction, and the result was a compact crowd going towards\nPresident Barbicane's dwelling.\n\nThe president, since the arrival of the message, had not said what he\nthought about it; he had let J.T. Maston express his opinions without\nmanifesting either approbation or blame. He kept quiet, proposing to\nawait events, but he had not taken public impatience into consideration,\nand was not very pleased at the sight of the population of Tampa Town\nassembled under his windows. Murmurs, cries, and vociferations soon\nforced him to appear. It will be seen that he had all the disagreeables\nas well as the duties of a public man.\n\nHe therefore appeared; silence was made, and a citizen asked him the\nfollowing question:--\"Is the person designated in the telegram as Michel\nArdan on his way to America or not?\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" answered Barbicane, \"I know no more than you.\"\n\n\"We must get to know,\" exclaimed some impatient voices.\n\n\"Time will inform us,\" answered the president coldly.\n\n\"Time has no right to keep a whole country in suspense,\" answered the\norator. \"Have you altered your plans for the projectile as the telegram\ndemanded?\"\n\n\"Not yet, gentlemen; but you are right, we must have recourse to the\ntelegraph that has caused all this emotion.\"\n\n\"To the telegraph-office!\" cried the crowd.\n\nBarbicane descended into the street, and, heading the immense\nassemblage, he went towards the telegraph-office.\n\nA few minutes afterwards a telegram was on its way to the underwriters\nat Liverpool, asking for an answer to the following questions:--\n\n\"What sort of vessel is the _Atlanta_? When did she leave Europe? Had\nshe a Frenchman named Michel Ardan on board?\"\n\nTwo hours afterwards Barbicane received such precise information that\ndoubt was no longer possible.\n\n\"The steamer _Atlanta_, from Liverpool, set sail on October 2nd for\nTampa Town, having on board a Frenchman inscribed in the passengers'\nbook as Michel Ardan.\"\n\nAt this confirmation of the first telegram the eyes of the president\nwere lighted up with a sudden flame; he clenched his hands, and was\nheard to mutter--\n\n\"It is true, then! It is possible, then! the Frenchman does exist! and\nin a fortnight he will be here! But he is a madman! I never can\nconsent.\"\n\nAnd yet the very same evening he wrote to the firm of Breadwill and Co.\nbegging them to suspend the casting of the projectile until fresh\norders.\n\nNow how can the emotion be described which took possession of the whole\nof America? The effect of the Barbicane proposition was surpassed\ntenfold; what the newspapers of the Union said, the way they accepted\nthe news, and how they chanted the arrival of this hero from the old\ncontinent; how to depict the feverish agitation in which every one\nlived, counting the hours, minutes, and seconds; how to give even a\nfeeble idea of the effect of one idea upon so many heads; how to show\nevery occupation being given up for a single preoccupation, work\nstopped, commerce suspended, vessels, ready to start, waiting in the\nports so as not to miss the arrival of the _Atlanta_, every species of\nconveyance arriving full and returning empty, the bay of Espiritu-Santo\nincessantly ploughed by steamers, packet-boats, pleasure-yachts, and\nfly-boats of all dimensions; how to denominate in numbers the thousands\nof curious people who in a fortnight increased the population of Tampa\nTown fourfold, and were obliged to encamp under tents like an army in\ncampaign--all this is a task above human force, and could not be\nundertaken without rashness.\n\nAt 9 a.m. on the 20th of October the semaphores of the Bahama Channel\nsignalled thick smoke on the horizon. Two hours later a large steamer\nexchanged signals with them. The name _Atlanta_ was immediately sent to\nTampa Town. At 4 p.m. the English vessel entered the bay of\nEspiritu-Santo. At 5 p.m. she passed the entrance to Hillisboro Harbour,\nand at 6 p.m. weighed anchor in the port of Tampa Town.\n\nThe anchor had not reached its sandy bed before 500 vessels surrounded\nthe _Atlanta_ and the steamer was taken by assault. Barbicane was the\nfirst on deck, and in a voice the emotion of which he tried in vain to\nsuppress--\n\n\"Michel Ardan!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Present!\" answered an individual mounted on the poop.\n\nBarbicane, with his arms crossed, questioning eyes, and silent mouth,\nlooked fixedly at the passenger of the _Atlanta_.\n\nHe was a man forty-two years of age, tall, but already rather stooping,\nlike caryatides which support balconies on their shoulders. His large\nhead shook every now and then a shock of red hair like a lion's mane; a\nshort face, wide forehead, a moustache bristling like a cat's whiskers,\nand little bunches of yellow hair on the middle of his cheeks, round and\nrather wild-looking, short-sighted eyes completed this eminently feline\nphysiognomy. But the nose was boldly cut, the mouth particularly humane,\nthe forehead high, intelligent, and ploughed like a field that was never\nallowed to remain fallow. Lastly, a muscular body well poised on long\nlimbs, muscular arms, powerful and well-set levers, and a decided gait\nmade a solidly built fellow of this European, \"rather wrought than\ncast,\" to borrow one of his expressions from metallurgic art.\n\nThe disciples of Lavater or Gratiolet would have easily deciphered in\nthe cranium and physiognomy of this personage indisputable signs of\ncombativity--that is to say, of courage in danger and tendency to\novercome obstacles, those of benevolence, and a belief in the\nmarvellous, an instinct that makes many natures dwell much on superhuman\nthings; but, on the other hand, the bumps of acquisivity, the need of\npossessing and acquiring, were absolutely wanting.\n\nTo put the finishing touches to the physical type of the passenger of\nthe _Atlanta_, his garments wide, loose, and flowing, open cravat, wide\ncollar, and cuffs always unbuttoned, through which came nervous hands.\nPeople felt that even in the midst of winter and dangers that man was\nnever cold.\n\nOn the deck of the steamer, amongst the crowd, he bustled about, never\nstill for a moment, \"dragging his anchors,\" in nautical speech,\ngesticulating, making friends with everybody, and biting his nails\nnervously. He was one of those original beings whom the Creator invents\nin a moment of fantasy, and of whom He immediately breaks the cast.\n\nIn fact, the character of Michel Ardan offered a large field for\nphysiological analysis. This astonishing man lived in a perpetual\ndisposition to hyperbole, and had not yet passed the age of\nsuperlatives; objects depicted themselves on the retina of his eye with\nexaggerated dimensions; from thence an association of gigantic ideas; he\nsaw everything on a large scale except difficulties and men.\n\nHe was besides of a luxuriant nature, an artist by instinct, and witty\nfellow; he loved arguments _ad hominem_, and defended the weak side\ntooth and nail.\n\nAmongst other peculiarities he gave himself out as \"sublimely ignorant,\"\nlike Shakspeare, and professed supreme contempt for all _savants_,\n\"people,\" said he, \"who only score our points.\" He was, in short, a\nBohemian of the country of brains, adventurous but not an adventurer, a\nharebrained fellow, a Phaeton running away with the horses of the sun, a\nkind of Icarus with relays of wings. He had a wonderful facility for\ngetting into scrapes, and an equally wonderful facility for getting out\nof them again, falling on his feet like a cat.\n\nIn short, his motto was, \"Whatever it may cost!\" and the love of the\nimpossible his \"ruling passion,\" according to Pope's fine expression.\n\nBut this enterprising fellow had the defects of his qualities. Who risks\nnothing wins nothing, it is said. Ardan often risked much and got\nnothing. He was perfectly disinterested and chivalric; he would not have\nsigned the death-warrant of his worst enemy, and would have sold himself\ninto slavery to redeem a negro.\n\nIn France and Europe everybody knew this brilliant, bustling person. Did\nhe not get talked of ceaselessly by the hundred voices of Fame, hoarse\nin his service? Did he not live in a glass house, taking the entire\nuniverse as confidant of his most intimate secrets? But he also\npossessed an admirable collection of enemies amongst those he had cuffed\nand wounded whilst using his elbows to make a passage in the crowd.\n\nStill he was generally liked and treated like a spoiled child. Every one\nwas interested in his bold enterprises, and followed them with uneasy\nmind. He was known to be so imprudent! When some friend wished to stop\nhim by predicting an approaching catastrophe, \"The forest is only burnt\nby its own trees,\" he answered with an amiable smile, not knowing that\nhe was quoting the prettiest of Arabian proverbs.\n\nSuch was the passenger of the _Atlanta_, always in a bustle, always\nboiling under the action of inward fire, always moved, not by what he\nhad come to do in America--he did not even think about it--but on\naccount of his feverish organisation. If ever individuals offered a\nstriking contrast they were the Frenchman Michel Ardan and the Yankee\nBarbicane, both, however, enterprising, bold, and audacious, each in his\nown way.\n\nBarbicane's contemplation of his rival was quickly interrupted by the\ncheers of the crowd. These cries became even so frantic and the\nenthusiasm took such a personal form that Michel Ardan, after having\nshaken a thousand hands in which he nearly left his ten fingers, was\nobliged to take refuge in his cabin.\n\nBarbicane followed him without having uttered a word.\n\n\"You are Barbicane?\" Michel Ardan asked him as soon as they were alone,\nand in the same tone as he would have spoken to a friend of twenty\nyears' standing.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the president of the Gun Club.\n\n\"Well, good morning, Barbicane. How are you? Very well? That's right!\nthat's right!\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Barbicane, without further preliminary, \"you have decided\nto go?\"\n\n\"Quite decided.\"\n\n\"Nothing will stop you?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Have you altered your projectile as I told you in my message?\"\n\n\"I waited till you came. But,\" asked Barbicane, insisting once more,\n\"you have quite reflected?\"\n\n\"Reflected! have I any time to lose? I find the occasion to go for a\ntrip to the moon, I profit by it, and that is all. It seems to me that\ndoes not want so much reflection.\"\n\nBarbicane looked eagerly at the man who spoke of his project of journey\nwith so much carelessness, and with such absence of anxiety.\n\n\"But at least,\" he said, \"you have some plan, some means of execution?\"\n\n\"Excellent means. But allow me to tell you one thing. I like to say my\nsay once and for all, and to everybody, and to hear no more about it.\nThen, unless you can think of something better, call together your\nfriends, your colleagues, all the town, all Florida, all America if you\nlike, and to-morrow I shall be ready to state my means of execution, and\nanswer any objections, whatever they may be. Will that do?\"\n\n\"Yes, that will do,\" answered Barbicane.\n\nWhereupon the president left the cabin, and told the crowd about Michel\nArdan's proposition. His words were received with great demonstrations\nof joy. That cut short all difficulties. The next day every one could\ncontemplate the European hero at their ease. Still some of the most\nobstinate spectators would not leave the deck of the _Atlanta_; they\npassed the night on board. Amongst others, J.T. Maston had screwed his\nsteel hook into the combing of the poop, and it would have taken the\ncapstan to get it out again.\n\n\"He is a hero! a hero!\" cried he in every tone, \"and we are only old\nwomen compared to that European!\"\n\nAs to the president, after having requested the spectators to withdraw,\nhe re-entered the passenger's cabin, and did not leave it till the bell\nof the steamer rang out the midnight quarter.\n\nBut then the two rivals in popularity shook each other warmly by the\nhand, and separated friends.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nA MEETING.\n\n\nThe next day the sun did not rise early enough to satisfy public\nimpatience. Barbicane, fearing that indiscreet questions would be put to\nMichel Ardan, would like to have reduced his auditors to a small number\nof adepts, to his colleagues for instance. But it was as easy as to dam\nup the Falls at Niagara. He was, therefore, obliged to renounce his\nproject, and let his friend run all the risks of a public lecture. The\nnew Town Hall of Tampa Town, notwithstanding its colossal dimensions,\nwas considered insufficient for the occasion, which had assumed the\nproportions of a public meeting.\n\nThe place chosen was a vast plain, situated outside the town. In a few\nhours they succeeded in sheltering it from the rays of the sun. The\nships of the port, rich in canvas, furnished the necessary accessories\nfor a colossal tent. Soon an immense sky of cloth was spread over the\ncalcined plain, and defended it against the heat of the day. There\n300,000 persons stood and braved a stifling temperature for several\nhours whilst awaiting the Frenchman's arrival. Of that crowd of\nspectators one-third alone could see and hear; a second third saw badly,\nand did not hear. As to the remaining third, it neither heard nor saw,\nthough it was not the least eager to applaud.\n\nAt three o'clock Michel Ardan made his appearance, accompanied by the\nprincipal members of the Gun Club. He gave his right arm to President\nBarbicane, and his left to J.T. Maston, more radiant than the midday\nsun, and nearly as ruddy.\n\nArdan mounted the platform, from which his eyes extended over a forest\nof black hats. He did not seem in the least embarrassed; he did not\npose; he was at home there, gay, familiar, and amiable. To the cheers\nthat greeted him he answered by a gracious bow; then with his hand asked\nfor silence, began to speak in English, and expressed himself very\ncorrectly in these terms:--\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"although it is very warm, I intend to keep you a\nfew minutes to give you some explanation of the projects which have\nappeared to interest you. I am neither an orator nor a _savant_, and I\ndid not count upon having to speak in public; but my friend Barbicane\ntells me it would give you pleasure, so I do it. Then listen to me with\nyour 600,000 ears, and please to excuse the faults of the orator.\"\n\nThis unceremonious beginning was much admired by the audience, who\nexpressed their satisfaction by an immense murmur of applause.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"no mark of approbation or dissent is prohibited.\nThat settled, I continue. And, first of all, do not forget that you have\nto do with an ignorant man, but his ignorance goes far enough to ignore\ndifficulties. It has, therefore, appeared a simple, natural, and easy\nthing to him to take his passage in a projectile and to start for the\nmoon. That journey would be made sooner or later, and as to the mode of\nlocomotion adopted, it simply follows the law of progress. Man began by\ntravelling on all fours, then one fine day he went on two feet, then in\na cart, then in a coach, then on a railway. Well, the projectile is the\ncarriage of the future, and, to speak the truth, planets are only\nprojectiles, simple cannon-balls hurled by the hand of the Creator. But\nto return to our vehicle. Some of you, gentlemen, may think that the\nspeed it will travel at is excessive--nothing of the kind. All the\nplanets go faster, and the earth itself in its movement round the sun\ncarries us along three times as fast. Here are some examples. Only I ask\nyour permission to express myself in leagues, for American measures are\nnot very familiar to me, and I fear getting muddled in my calculations.\"\n\nThe demand appeared quite simple, and offered no difficulty. The orator\nresumed his speech.\n\n\"The following, gentlemen, is the speed of the different planets. I am\nobliged to acknowledge that, notwithstanding my ignorance, I know this\nsmall astronomical detail exactly, but in two minutes you will be as\nlearned as I. Learn, then, that Neptune goes at the rate of 5,000\nleagues an hour; Uranus, 7,000; Saturn, 8,858; Jupiter, 11,675; Mars,\n22,011; the earth, 27,500; Venus, 32,190; Mercury, 52,520; some comets,\n14,000 leagues in their perihelion! As to us, veritable idlers, people\nin no hurry, our speed does not exceed 9,900 leagues, and it will go on\ndecreasing! I ask you if there is anything to wonder at, and if it is\nnot evident that it will be surpassed some day by still greater speeds,\nof which light or electricity will probably be the mechanical agents?\"\n\nNo one seemed to doubt this affirmation.\n\n\"Dear hearers,\" he resumed, \"according to certain narrow minds--that is\nthe best qualification for them--humanity is inclosed in a Popilius\ncircle which it cannot break open, and is condemned to vegetate upon\nthis globe without ever flying towards the planetary shores! Nothing of\nthe kind! We are going to the moon, we shall go to the planets, we shall\ngo to the stars as we now go from Liverpool to New York, easily,\nrapidly, surely, and the atmospheric ocean will be as soon crossed as\nthe oceans of the earth! Distance is only a relative term, and will end\nby being reduced to zero.\"\n\nThe assembly, though greatly in favour of the French hero, was rather\nstaggered by this audacious theory. Michel Ardan appeared to see it.\n\n\"You do not seem convinced, my worthy hosts,\" he continued with an\namiable smile. \"Well, let us reason a little. Do you know how long it\nwould take an express train to reach the moon? Three hundred days. Not\nmore. A journey of 86,410 leagues, but what is that? Not even nine times\nround the earth, and there are very few sailors who have not done that\nduring their existence. Think, I shall be only ninety-eight hours on the\nroad! Ah, you imagine that the moon is a long way from the earth, and\nthat one must think twice before attempting the adventure! But what\nwould you say if I were going to Neptune, which gravitates at\n1,147,000,000 leagues from the sun? That is a journey that very few\npeople could go, even if it only cost a farthing a mile! Even Baron\nRothschild would not have enough to take his ticket!\"\n\nThis argument seemed greatly to please the assembly; besides, Michel\nArdan, full of his subject, grew superbly eloquent; he felt he was\nlistened to, and resumed with admirable assurance--\n\n\"Well, my friends, this distance from Neptune to the sun is nothing\ncompared to that of the stars, some of which are billions of leagues\nfrom the sun! And yet people speak of the distance that separates the\nplanets from the sun! Do you know what I think of this universe that\nbegins with the sun and ends at Neptune? Should you like to know my\ntheory? It is a very simple one. According to my opinion, the solar\nuniverse is one solid homogeneous mass; the planets that compose it are\nclose together, crowd one another, and the space between them is only\nthe space that separates the molecules of the most compact\nmetal--silver, iron, or platinum! I have, therefore, the right to\naffirm, and I will repeat it with a conviction you will all\nshare--distance is a vain word; distance does not exist!\"\n\n\"Well said! Bravo! Hurrah!\" cried the assembly with one voice,\nelectrified by the gesture and accent of the orator, and the boldness of\nhis conceptions.\n\n\"No!\" cried J.T. Maston, more energetically than the others; \"distance\ndoes not exist!\"\n\nAnd, carried away by the violence of his movements and emotions he could\nhardly contain, he nearly fell from the top of the platform to the\nground. But he succeeded in recovering his equilibrium, and thus avoided\na fall that would have brutally proved distance not to be a vain word.\nThen the speech of the distinguished orator resumed its course.\n\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"I think that this question is now solved. If I\nhave not convinced you all it is because I have been timid in my\ndemonstrations, feeble in my arguments, and you must set it down to my\ntheoretic ignorance. However that may be, I repeat, the distance from\nthe earth to her satellite is really very unimportant and unworthy to\noccupy a serious mind. I do not think I am advancing too much in saying\nthat soon a service of trains will be established by projectiles, in\nwhich the journey from the earth to the moon will be comfortably\naccomplished. There will be no shocks nor running off the lines to fear,\nand the goal will be reached rapidly, without fatigue, in a straight\nline, 'as the crow flies.' Before twenty years are over, half the earth\nwill have visited the moon!\"\n\n\"Three cheers for Michel Ardan!\" cried the assistants, even those least\nconvinced.\n\n\"Three cheers for Barbicane!\" modestly answered the orator.\n\nThis act of gratitude towards the promoter of the enterprise was greeted\nwith unanimous applause.\n\n\"Now, my friends,\" resumed Michel Ardan, \"if you have any questions to\nask me you will evidently embarrass me, but still I will endeavour to\nanswer you.\"\n\nUntil now the president of the Gun Club had reason to be very satisfied\nwith the discussion. It had rolled upon speculative theories, upon which\nMichel Ardan, carried away by his lively imagination, had shown himself\nvery brilliant. He must, therefore, be prevented from deviating towards\npractical questions, which he would doubtless not come out of so well.\nBarbicane made haste to speak, and asked his new friend if he thought\nthat the moon or the planets were inhabited.\n\n\"That is a great problem, my worthy president,\" answered the orator,\nsmiling; \"still, if I am not mistaken, men of great intelligence--Plutarch,\nSwedenborg, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, and many others--answered in the\naffirmative. If I answered from a natural philosophy point of view I\nshould do the same--I should say to myself that nothing useless exists\nin this world, and, answering your question by another, friend\nBarbicane, I should affirm that if the planets are inhabitable, either\nthey are inhabited, they have been, or they will be.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" cried the first ranks of spectators, whose opinion had the\nforce of law for the others.\n\n\"It is impossible to answer with more logic and justice,\" said the\npresident of the Gun Club. \"The question, therefore, comes to this: 'Are\nthe planets inhabitable?' I think so, for my part.\"\n\n\"And I--I am certain of it,\" answered Michel Ardan.\n\n\"Still,\" replied one of the assistants, \"there are arguments against the\ninhabitability of the worlds. In most of them it is evident that the\nprinciples of life must be modified. Thus, only to speak of the planets,\nthe people must be burnt up in some and frozen in others according as\nthey are a long or short distance from the sun.\"\n\n\"I regret,\" answered Michel Ardan, \"not to know my honourable opponent\npersonally. His objection has its value, but I think it may be combated\nwith some success, like all those of which the habitability of worlds\nhas been the object. If I were a physician I should say that if there\nwere less caloric put in motion in the planets nearest to the sun, and\nmore, on the contrary, in the distant planets, this simple phenomenon\nwould suffice to equalise the heat and render the temperature of these\nworlds bearable to beings organised like we are. If I were a naturalist\nI should tell him, after many illustrious _savants_, that Nature\nfurnishes us on earth with examples of animals living in very different\nconditions of habitability; that fish breathe in a medium mortal to the\nother animals; that amphibians have a double existence difficult to\nexplain; that certain inhabitants of the sea live in the greatest\ndepths, and support there, without being crushed, pressures of fifty or\nsixty atmospheres; that some aquatic insects, insensible to the\ntemperature, are met with at the same time in springs of boiling water\nand in the frozen plains of the Polar Ocean--in short, there are in\nnature many means of action, often incomprehensible, but no less real.\nIf I were a chemist I should say that a\u00ebrolites--bodies evidently formed\naway from our terrestrial globe--have when analysed, revealed\nindisputable traces of carbon, a substance that owes its origin solely\nto organised beings, and which, according to Reichenbach's experiments,\nmust necessarily have been 'animalised.' Lastly, if I were a theologian\nI should say that Divine Redemption, according to St. Paul, seems\napplicable not only to the earth but to all the celestial bodies. But I\nam neither a theologian, chemist, naturalist, nor natural philosopher.\nSo, in my perfect ignorance of the great laws that rule the universe, I\ncan only answer, 'I do not know if the heavenly bodies are inhabited,\nand, as I do not know, I am going to see!'\"\n\nDid the adversary of Michel Ardan's theories hazard any further\narguments? It is impossible to say, for the frantic cries of the crowd\nwould have prevented any opinion from being promulgated. When silence\nwas again restored, even in the most distant groups, the triumphant\norator contented himself with adding the following considerations:--\n\n\"You will think, gentlemen, that I have hardly touched upon this grave\nquestion. I am not here to give you an instructive lecture upon this\nvast subject. There is another series of arguments in favour of the\nheavenly bodies being inhabited; I do not look upon that. Allow me only\nto insist upon one point. To the people who maintain that the planets\nare not inhabited you must answer, 'You may be right if it is\ndemonstrated that the earth is the best of possible worlds; but it is\nnot so, notwithstanding Voltaire.' It has only one satellite, whilst\nJupiter, Uranus, Saturn, and Neptune have several at their service, an\nadvantage that is not to be disdained. But that which now renders the\nearth an uncomfortable place of abode is the inclination of its axis\nupon its orbit. Hence the inequality of day and night; hence the\nunfortunate diversity of seasons. Upon our miserable spheroid it is\nalways either too warm or too cold; we are frozen in winter and roasted\nin summer; it is the planet of colds, rheumatism, and consumption,\nwhilst on the surface of Jupiter, for instance, where the axis has only\na very slight inclination, the inhabitants can enjoy invariable\ntemperature. There is the perpetual spring, summer, autumn, and winter\nzone; each 'Jovian' may choose the climate that suits him, and may\nshelter himself all his life from the variations of the temperature. You\nwill doubtless agree to this superiority of Jupiter over our planet\nwithout speaking of its years, which each lasts twelve years! What is\nmore, it is evident to me that, under these auspices, and under such\nmarvellous conditions of existence, the inhabitants of that fortunate\nworld are superior beings--that _savants_ are more learned, artists more\nartistic, the wicked less wicked, and the good are better. Alas! what is\nwanting to our spheroid to reach this perfection is very little!--an\naxis of rotation less inclined on the plane of its orbit.\"\n\n\"Well!\" cried an impetuous voice, \"let us unite our efforts, invent\nmachines, and rectify the earth's axis!\"\n\nThunders of applause greeted this proposition, the author of which could\nbe no other than J.T. Maston. It is probable that the fiery secretary\nhad been carried away by his instincts as engineer to venture such a\nproposition; but it must be said, for it is the truth, many encouraged\nhim with their cries, and doubtless, if they had found the resting-point\ndemanded by Archimedes, the Americans would have constructed a lever\ncapable of raising the world and redressing its axis. But this point was\nwanting to these bold mechanicians.\n\nNevertheless, this eminently practical idea had enormous success: the\ndiscussion was suspended for a good quarter of an hour, and long, very\nlong afterwards, they talked in the United States of America of the\nproposition so energetically enunciated by the perpetual secretary of\nthe Gun Club.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nTHRUST AND PARRY.\n\n\nThis incident seemed to have terminated the discussion, but when the\nagitation had subsided these words were heard uttered in a loud and\nsevere voice:--\n\n\"Now that the orator has allowed his fancy to roam, perhaps he would\nkindly go back to his subject, pay less attention to theories, and\ndiscuss the practical part of his expedition.\"\n\nAll eyes were turned towards the person who spoke thus. He was a thin,\ndry-looking man, with an energetic face and an American beard. By taking\nadvantage of the agitation in the assembly from time to time he had\ngained, by degrees, the front row of spectators. There, with his arms\ncrossed, his eyes brilliant and bold, he stared imperturbably at the\nhero of the meeting. After having asked his question he kept silence,\nand did not seem disturbed by the thousands of eyes directed towards him\nnor by the disapproving murmur excited by his words. The answer being\ndelayed he again put the question with the same clear and precise\naccent; then he added--\n\n\"We are here to discuss the moon, not the earth.\"\n\n\"You are right, sir,\" answered Michel Ardan, \"the discussion has\nwandered from the point; we will return to the moon.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" resumed the unknown man, \"you pretend that our satellite is\ninhabited. So far so good; but if Selenites do exist they certainly live\nwithout breathing, for--I tell you the fact for your good--there is not\nthe least particle of air on the surface of the moon.\"\n\nAt this affirmation Ardan shook his red mane; he understood that a\nstruggle was coming with this man on the real question. He looked at him\nfixedly in his turn, and said--\n\n\"Ah! there is no air in the moon! And who says so, pray?\"\n\n\"The _savants_.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"Indeed.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" resumed Michel, \"joking apart, I have a profound respect for\n_savants_ who know, but a profound contempt for _savants_ who do not\nknow.\"\n\n\"Do you know any who belong to the latter category?\"\n\n\"Yes; in France there is one who maintains that, 'mathematically,' a\nbird cannot fly, and another who demonstrates that a fish is not made to\nlive in water.\"\n\n\"There is no question of those two, sir, and I can quote in support of\nmy proposition names that you will not object to.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, you would greatly embarrass a poor ignorant man like me!\"\n\n\"Then why do you meddle with scientific questions which you have never\nstudied?\" asked the unknown brutally.\n\n\"Why?\" answered Ardan; \"because the man who does not suspect danger is\nalways brave! I know nothing, it is true, but it is precisely my\nweakness that makes my strength.\"\n\n\"Your weakness goes as far as madness,\" exclaimed the unknown in a\nbad-tempered tone.\n\n\"So much the better,\" replied the Frenchman, \"if my madness takes me to\nthe moon!\"\n\nBarbicane and his colleagues stared at the intruder who had come so\nboldly to stand in the way of their enterprise. None of them knew him,\nand the president, not reassured upon the upshot of such a discussion,\nlooked at his new friend with some apprehension. The assembly was\nattentive and slightly uneasy, for this struggle called attention to the\ndangers and impossibilities of the expedition.\n\n\"Sir,\" resumed Michel Ardan's adversary, \"the reasons that prove the\nabsence of all atmosphere round the moon are numerous and indisputable.\nI may say, even, that, _\u00e0 priori_ if that atmosphere had ever existed,\nit must have been drawn away by the earth, but I would rather oppose you\nwith incontestable facts.\"\n\n\"Oppose, sir,\" answered Michel Ardan, with perfect gallantry--oppose as\nmuch as you like.\"\n\n\"You know,\" said the unknown, \"that when the sun's rays traverse a\nmedium like air they are deviated from a straight line, or, in other\nwords, they are refracted. Well, when stars are occulted by the moon\ntheir rays, on grazing the edge of her disc, do not show the least\ndeviation nor offer the slightest indication of refraction. It follows,\ntherefore, that the moon can have no atmosphere.\"\n\nEvery one looked at the Frenchman, for, this once admitted, the\nconsequences were rigorous.\n\n\"In fact,\" answered Michel Ardan, \"that is your best if not only\nargument, and a _savant_, perhaps, would be embarrassed to answer it. I\ncan only tell you that this argument has no absolute value because it\nsupposes the angular diameter of the moon to be perfectly determined,\nwhich it is not. But let us waive that, and tell me, my dear sir, if\nyou admit the existence of volcanoes on the surface of the moon.\"\n\n\"Extinct volcanoes, yes; volcanoes in eruption, no.\"\n\n\"For the sake of argument let us suppose that these volcanoes have been\nin eruption for a certain period.\"\n\n\"That is certain, but as they can themselves furnish the oxygen\nnecessary for combustion the fact of their eruption does not in the\nleast prove the presence of a lunar atmosphere.\"\n\n\"We will pass on, then,\" answered Michel Ardan, \"and leave this series\nof argument and arrive at direct observation. But I warn you that I am\ngoing to quote names.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"In 1715 the astronomers Louville and Halley, observing the eclipse of\nthe 3rd of May, remarked certain fulminations of a remarkable nature.\nThese jets of light, rapid and frequent, were attributed by them to\nstorms in the atmosphere of the moon.\"\n\n\"In 1715,\" replied the unknown, \"the astronomers Louville and Halley\ntook for lunar phenomena phenomena purely terrestrial, such as meteoric\nor other bodies which are generated in our own atmosphere. That was the\nscientific aspect of these facts, and I go with it.\"\n\n\"Let us pass on again,\" answered Ardan, without being confused by the\nreply. \"Did not Herschel, in 1787, observe a great number of luminous\npoints on the surface of the moon?\"\n\n\"Certainly; but without explaining the origin of these luminous points.\nHerschel himself did not thereby conclude the necessity of a lunar\natmosphere.\"\n\n\"Well answered,\" said Michel Ardan, complimenting his adversary; \"I see\nthat you are well up in selenography.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; and I may add that the most skilful observers, MM. Boeer and\nMoedler, agree that air is absolutely wanting on the moon's surface.\"\n\nA movement took place amongst the audience, who appeared struck by the\narguments of this singular personage.\n\n\"We will pass on again,\" answered Michel Ardan, with the greatest\ncalmness, \"and arrive now at an important fact. A skilful French\nastronomer, M. Laussedat, whilst observing the eclipse of July 18th,\n1860, proved that the horns of the solar crescent were rounded and\ntruncated. Now this appearance could only have been produced by a\ndeviation of the solar rays in traversing the atmosphere of the moon.\nThere is no other possible explanation of the fact.\"\n\n\"But is this fact authenticated?\"\n\n\"It is absolutely certain.\"\n\nAn inverse movement brought back the audience to the side of their\nfavourite hero, whose adversary remained silent.\n\nArdan went on speaking without showing any vanity about his last\nadvantage; he said simply--\n\n\"You see, therefore, my dear sir, that it cannot be positively affirmed\nthat there is no atmosphere on the surface of the moon. This atmosphere\nis probably not dense, but science now generally admits that it exists.\"\n\n\"Not upon the mountains,\" replied the unknown, who would not give in.\n\n\"No, but in the depths of the valleys, and it is not more than some\nhundreds of feet deep.\"\n\n\"Any way you will do well to take your precautions, for the air will be\nterribly rarefied.\"\n\n\"Oh, there will always be enough for one man. Besides, once delivered up\nthere, I shall do my best to economise it and only to breathe it on\ngreat occasions.\"\n\nA formidable burst of laughter saluted the mysterious interlocutor, who\nlooked round the assembly daring it proudly.\n\n\"Then,\" resumed Michel Ardan, carelessly, \"as we are agreed upon the\npresence of some atmosphere, we are forced to admit the presence of some\nwater--a consequence I am delighted with, for my part. Besides, I have\nanother observation to make. We only know one side of the moon's disc,\nand if there is little air on that side there may be much on the other.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Because the moon under the action of terrestrial attraction has assumed\nthe form of an egg, of which we see the small end. Hence the consequence\ndue to the calculations of Hausen, that its centre of gravity is\nsituated in the other hemisphere. Hence this conclusion that all the\nmasses of air and water have been drawn to the other side of our\nsatellite in the first days of the creation.\"\n\n\"Pure fancies,\" exclaimed the unknown.\n\n\"No, pure theories based upon mechanical laws, and it appears difficult\nto me to refute them. I make appeal to this assembly and put it to the\nvote to know if life such as it exists upon earth is possible on the\nsurface of the moon?\"\n\nThree hundred thousand hearers applauded this proposition. Michel\nArdan's adversary wished to speak again, but he could not make himself\nheard. Cries and threats were hailed upon him.\n\n\"Enough, enough!\" said some.\n\n\"Turn him out!\" repeated others.\n\nBut he, holding on to the platform, did not move, and let the storm\npass by. It might have assumed formidable proportions if Michel Ardan\nhad not appeased it by a gesture. He was too chivalrous to abandon his\ncontradicter in such an extremity.\n\n\"You wish to add a few words?\" he asked, in the most gracious tone.\n\n\"Yes, a hundred! a thousand!\" answered the unknown, carried away, \"or\nrather no, one only! To persevere in your enterprise you must be--\"\n\n\"Imprudent! How can you call me that when I have asked for a\ncylindro-conical bullet from my friend Barbicane so as not to turn round\non the road like a squirrel?\"\n\n\"But, unfortunate man! the fearful shock will smash you to pieces when\nyou start.\"\n\n\"You have there put your finger upon the real and only difficulty; but I\nhave too good an opinion of the industrial genius of the Americans to\nbelieve that they will not overcome that difficulty.\"\n\n\"But the heat developed by the speed of the projectile whilst crossing\nthe beds of air?\"\n\n\"Oh, its sides are thick, and I shall so soon pass the atmosphere.\"\n\n\"But provisions? water?\"\n\n\"I have calculated that I could carry enough for one year, and I shall\nonly be four days going.\"\n\n\"But air to breathe on the road?\"\n\n\"I shall make some by chemical processes.\"\n\n\"But your fall upon the moon, supposing you ever get there?\"\n\n\"It will be six times less rapid than a fall upon the earth, as\nattraction is six times less on the surface of the moon.\"\n\n\"But it still will be sufficient to smash you like glass.\"\n\n\"What will prevent me delaying my fall by means of rockets conveniently\nplaced and lighted at the proper time?\"\n\n\"But lastly, supposing that all difficulties be solved, all obstacles\ncleared away by uniting every chance in your favour, admitting that you\nreach the moon safe and well, how shall you come back?\"\n\n\"I shall not come back.\"\n\nUpon this answer, which was almost sublime by reason of its simplicity,\nthe assembly remained silent. But its silence was more eloquent than its\ncries of enthusiasm would have been. The unknown profited by it to\nprotest one last time.\n\n\"You will infallibly kill yourself,\" he cried, \"and your death, which\nwill be only a madman's death, will not even be useful to science.\"\n\n\"Go on, most generous of men, for you prophesy in the most agreeable\nmanner.\"\n\n\"Ah, it is too much!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan's adversary, \"and I do not\nknow why I go on with so childish a discussion. Go on with your mad\nenterprise as you like. It is not your fault.\"\n\n\"Fire away.\"\n\n\"No, another must bear the responsibility of your acts.\"\n\n\"Who is that, pray?\" asked Michel Ardan in an imperious voice.\n\n\"The fool who has organised this attempt, as impossible as it is\nridiculous.\"\n\nThe attack was direct. Barbicane since the intervention of the unknown\nhad made violent efforts to contain himself and \"consume his own smoke,\"\nbut upon seeing himself so outrageously designated he rose directly and\nwas going to walk towards his adversary, who dared him to his face, when\nhe felt himself suddenly separated from him.\n\nThe platform was lifted up all at once by a hundred vigorous arms, and\nthe president of the Gun Club was forced to share the honours of triumph\nwith Michel Ardan. The platform was heavy, but the bearers came in\ncontinuous relays, disputing, struggling, even fighting for the\nprivilege of lending the support of their shoulders to this\nmanifestation.\n\nHowever, the unknown did not take advantage of the tumult to leave the\nplace. He kept in the front row, his arms folded, still staring at\nPresident Barbicane.\n\nThe president did not lose sight of him either, and the eyes of these\ntwo men met like flaming swords.\n\nThe cries of the immense crowds kept at their maximum of intensity\nduring this triumphant march. Michel Ardan allowed himself to be carried\nwith evident pleasure.\n\nSometimes the platform pitched and tossed like a ship beaten by the\nwaves. But the two heroes of the meeting were good sailors, and their\nvessel safely arrived in the port of Tampa Town.\n\nMichel Ardan happily succeeded in escaping from his vigorous admirers.\nHe fled to the Franklin Hotel, quickly reached his room, and glided\nrapidly into bed whilst an army of 100,000 men watched under his\nwindows.\n\nIn the meanwhile a short, grave, and decisive scene had taken place\nbetween the mysterious personage and the president of the Gun Club.\n\nBarbicane, liberated at last, went straight to his adversary.\n\n\"Come!\" said he in a curt voice.\n\nThe stranger followed him on to the quay, and they were soon both alone\nat the entrance to a wharf opening on to Jones' Fall.\n\nThere these enemies, still unknown to one another, looked at each other.\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked Barbicane.\n\n\"Captain Nicholl.\"\n\n\"I thought so. Until now fate has never made you cross my path.\"\n\n\"I crossed it of my own accord.\"\n\n\"You have insulted me.\"\n\n\"Publicly.\"\n\n\"And you shall give me satisfaction for that insult.\"\n\n\"Now, this minute.\"\n\n\"No. I wish everything between us to be kept secret. There is a wood\nsituated three miles from Tampa--Skersnaw Wood. Do you know it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Will you enter it to-morrow morning at five o'clock by one side?\"\n\n\"Yes, if you will enter it by the other at the same time.\"\n\n\"And you will not forget your rifle?\" said Barbicane.\n\n\"Not more than you will forget yours,\" answered Captain Nicholl.\n\nAfter these words had been coldly pronounced the president of the Gun\nClub and the captain separated. Barbicane returned to his dwelling; but,\ninstead of taking some hours' rest, he passed the night in seeking means\nto avoid the shock of the projectile, and to solve the difficult problem\ngiven by Michel Ardan at the meeting.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nHOW A FRENCHMAN SETTLES AN AFFAIR.\n\n\nWhilst the duel was being discussed between the president and the\ncaptain--a terrible and savage duel in which each adversary became a\nman-hunter--Michel Ardan was resting after the fatigues of his triumph.\nResting is evidently not the right expression, for American beds rival\nin hardness tables of marble or granite.\n\nArdan slept badly, turning over and over between the _serviettes_ that\nserved him for sheets, and he was thinking of installing a more\ncomfortable bed in his projectile when a violent noise startled him from\nhis slumbers. Thundering blows shook his door. They seemed to be\nadministered with an iron instrument. Shouts were heard in this racket,\nrather too early to be agreeable.\n\n\"Open!\" some one cried. \"Open, for Heaven's sake!\"\n\nThere was no reason why Ardan should acquiesce in so peremptory a\ndemand. Still he rose and opened his door at the moment it was giving\nway under the efforts of the obstinate visitor.\n\nThe secretary of the Gun Club bounded into the room. A bomb would not\nhave entered with less ceremony.\n\n\"Yesterday evening,\" exclaimed J.T. Maston _ex abrupto_, \"our president\nwas publicly insulted during the meeting! He has challenged his\nadversary, who is no other than Captain Nicholl! They are going to fight\nthis morning in Skersnaw Wood! I learnt it all from Barbicane himself!\nIf he is killed our project will be at an end! This duel must be\nprevented! Now one man only can have enough empire over Barbicane to\nstop it, and that man is Michel Ardan.\"\n\nWhilst J.T. Maston was speaking thus, Michel Ardan, giving up\ninterrupting him, jumped into his vast trousers, and in less than two\nminutes after the two friends were rushing as fast as they could go\ntowards the suburbs of Tampa Town.\n\nIt was during this rapid course that Maston told Ardan the state of the\ncase. He told him the real causes of the enmity between Barbicane and\nNicholl, how that enmity was of old date, why until then, thanks to\nmutual friends, the president and the captain had never met; he added\nthat it was solely a rivalry between iron-plate and bullet; and, lastly,\nthat the scene of the meeting had only been an occasion long sought by\nNicholl to satisfy an old grudge.\n\nThere is nothing more terrible than these private duels in America,\nduring which the two adversaries seek each other across thickets, and\nhunt each other like wild animals. It is then that each must envy those\nmarvellous qualities so natural to the Indians of the prairies, their\nrapid intelligence, their ingenious ruse, their scent of the enemy. An\nerror, a hesitation, a wrong step, may cause death. In these meetings\nthe Yankees are often accompanied by their dogs, and both sportsmen and\ngame go on for hours.\n\n\"What demons you are!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, when his companion had\ndepicted the scene with much energy.\n\n\"We are what we are,\" answered J.T. Maston modestly; \"but let us make\nhaste.\"\n\nIn vain did Michel Ardan and he rush across the plain still wet with\ndew, jump the creeks, take the shortest cuts; they could not reach\nSkersnaw Wood before half-past five. Barbicane must have entered it\nhalf-an-hour before.\n\nThere an old bushman was tying up faggots his axe had cut.\n\nMaston ran to him crying--\n\n\"Have you seen a man enter the wood armed with a rifle? Barbicane, the\npresident--my best friend?\"\n\nThe worthy secretary of the Gun Club thought na\u00efvely that all the world\nmust know his president. But the bushman did not seem to understand.\n\n\"A sportsman,\" then said Ardan.\n\n\"A sportsman? Yes,\" answered the bushman.\n\n\"Is it long since?\"\n\n\"About an hour ago.\"\n\n\"Too late!\" exclaimed Maston.\n\n\"Have you heard any firing?\" asked Michel Ardan.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Not one shot?\"\n\n\"Not one. That sportsman does not seem to bag much game!\"\n\n\"What shall we do?\" said Maston.\n\n\"Enter the wood at the risk of catching a bullet not meant for us.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Maston, with an unmistakable accent, \"I would rather\nhave ten bullets in my head than one in Barbicane's head.\"\n\n\"Go ahead, then!\" said Ardan, pressing his companion's hand.\n\nA few seconds after the two companions disappeared in a copse. It was a\ndense thicket made of huge cypresses, sycamores, tulip-trees, olives,\ntamarinds, oaks, and magnolias. The different trees intermingled their\nbranches in inextricable confusion, and quite hid the view. Michel Ardan\nand Maston walked on side by side phasing silently through the tall\ngrass, making a road for themselves through the vigorous creepers,\nlooking in all the bushes or branches lost in the sombre shade of the\nfoliage, and expecting to hear a shot at every step. As to the traces\nthat Barbicane must have left of his passage through the wood, it was\nimpossible for them to see them, and they marched blindly on in the\nhardly-formed paths in which an Indian would have followed his adversary\nstep by step.\n\nAfter a vain search of about an hour's length the two companions\nstopped. Their anxiety was redoubled.\n\n\"It must be all over,\" said Maston in despair. \"A man like Barbicane\nwould not lay traps or condescend to any manoeuvre! He is too frank, too\ncourageous. He has gone straight into danger, and doubtless far enough\nfrom the bushman for the wind to carry off the noise of the shot!\"\n\n\"But we should have heard it!\" answered Michel Ardan.\n\n\"But what if we came too late?\" exclaimed J.T. Maston in an accent of\ndespair.\n\nMichel Ardan did not find any answer to make. Maston and he resumed\ntheir interrupted walk. From time to time they shouted; they called\neither Barbicane or Nicholl; but neither of the two adversaries\nanswered. Joyful flocks of birds, roused by the noise, disappeared\namongst the branches, and some frightened deer fled through the copses.\n\nThey continued their search another hour. The greater part of the wood\nhad been explored. Nothing revealed the presence of the combatants. They\nbegan to doubt the affirmation of the bushman, and Ardan was going to\nrenounce the pursuit as useless, when all at once Maston stopped.\n\n\"Hush!\" said he. \"There is some one yonder!\"\n\n\"Some one?\" answered Michel Ardan.\n\n\"Yes! a man! He does not seem to move. His rifle is not in his hand.\nWhat can he be doing?\"\n\n\"But do you recognise him?\" asked Michel Ardan.\n\n\"Yes, yes! he is turning round,\" answered Maston.\n\n\"Who is it?\"\n\n\"Captain Nicholl!\"\n\n\"Nicholl!\" cried Michel Ardan, whose heart almost stopped beating.\n\n\"Nicholl disarmed! Then he had nothing more to fear from his adversary?\"\n\n\"Let us go to him,\" said Michel Ardan; \"we shall know how it is.\"\n\nBut his companion and he had not gone fifty steps when they stopped to\nexamine the captain more attentively. They imagined they should find a\nbloodthirsty and revengeful man. Upon seeing him they remained\nstupefied.\n\nA net with fine meshes was hung between two gigantic tulip-trees, and in\nit a small bird, with its wings entangled, was struggling with plaintive\ncries. The bird-catcher who had hung the net was not a human being but a\nvenomous spider, peculiar to the country, as large as a pigeon's egg,\nand furnished with enormous legs. The hideous insect, as he was rushing\non his prey, was forced to turn back and take refuge in the high\nbranches of a tulip-tree, for a formidable enemy threatened him in his\nturn.\n\nIn fact, Captain Nicholl, with his gun on the ground, forgetting the\ndangers of his situation, was occupied in delivering as delicately as\npossible the victim taken in the meshes of the monstrous spider. When he\nhad finished he let the little bird fly away; it fluttered its wings\njoyfully and disappeared.\n\nNicholl, touched, was watching it fly through the copse when he heard\nthese words uttered in a voice full of emotion:--\n\n\"You are a brave man, you are!\"\n\nHe turned. Michel Ardan was in front of him, repeating in every tone--\n\n\"And a kind one!\"\n\n\"Michel Ardan!\" exclaimed the captain, \"what have you come here for,\nsir?\"\n\n\"To shake hands with you, Nicholl, and prevent you killing Barbicane or\nbeing killed by him.\"\n\n\"Barbicane!\" cried the captain, \"I have been looking for him these two\nhours without finding him! Where is he hiding himself?\"\n\n\"Nicholl!\" said Michel Ardan, \"this is not polite! You must always\nrespect your adversary; don't be uneasy; if Barbicane is alive we shall\nfind him, and so much the more easily that if he has not amused himself\nwith protecting birds he must be looking for you too. But when you have\nfound him--and Michel Ardan tells you this--there will be no duel\nbetween you.\"\n\n\"Between President Barbicane and me,\" answered Nicholl gravely, \"there\nis such rivalry that the death of one of us--\"\n\n\"Come, come!\" resumed Michel Ardan, \"brave men like you may detest one\nanother, but they respect one another too. You will not fight.\"\n\n\"I shall fight, sir.\"\n\n\"No you won't.\"\n\n\"Captain,\" then said J.T. Maston heartily, \"I am the president's friend,\nhis _alter ego_; if you must absolutely kill some one kill me; that will\nbe exactly the same thing.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Nicholl, convulsively seizing his rifle, \"this joking--\"\n\n\"Friend Maston is not joking,\" answered Michel Ardan, \"and I understand\nhis wanting to be killed for the man he loves; but neither he nor\nBarbicane will fall under Captain Nicholl's bullets, for I have so\ntempting a proposition to make to the two rivals that they will hasten\nto accept it.\"\n\n\"But what is it, pray?\" asked Nicholl, with visible incredulity.\n\n\"Patience,\" answered Ardan; \"I can only communicate it in Barbicane's\npresence.\"\n\n\"Let us look for him, then,\" cried the captain.\n\nThe three men immediately set out; the captain, having discharged his\nrifle, threw it on his shoulder and walked on in silence.\n\nDuring another half-hour the search was in vain. Maston was seized with\na sinister presentiment. He observed Captain Nicholl closely, asking\nhimself if, once the captain's vengeance satisfied, the unfortunate\nBarbicane had not been left lying in some bloody thicket. Michel Ardan\nseemed to have the same thought, and they were both looking\nquestioningly at Captain Nicholl when Maston suddenly stopped.\n\nThe motionless bust of a man leaning against a gigantic catalpa appeared\ntwenty feet off half hidden in the grass.\n\n\"It is he!\" said Maston.\n\nBarbicane did not move. Ardan stared at the captain, but he did not\nwince. Ardan rushed forward, crying--\n\n\"Barbicane! Barbicane!\"\n\nNo answer. Ardan was about to seize his arm; he stopped short, uttering\na cry of surprise.\n\nBarbicane, with a pencil in his hand, was tracing geometrical figures\nupon a memorandum-book, whilst his unloaded gun lay on the ground.\n\nAbsorbed in his work, the _savant_, forgetting in his turn his duel and\nhis vengeance, had neither seen nor heard anything.\n\nBut when Michel Ardan placed his hand on that of the president, he got\nup and looked at him with astonishment.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried he at last; \"you here! I have found it, my friend, I have\nfound it!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The way to do it.\"\n\n\"The way to do what?\"\n\n\"To counteract the effect of the shock at the departure of the\nprojectile.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Michel, looking at the captain out of the corner of his\neye.\n\n\"Yes, water! simply water, which will act as a spring. Ah, Maston!\"\ncried Barbicane, \"you too!\"\n\n\"Himself,\" answered Michel Ardan; \"and allow me to introduce at the same\ntime the worthy Captain Nicholl.\"\n\n\"Nicholl!\" cried Barbicane, up in a moment. \"Excuse me, captain,\" said\nhe; \"I had forgotten. I am ready.\"\n\nMichel Ardan interfered before the two enemies had time to recriminate.\n\n\"Faith,\" said he, \"it is fortunate that brave fellows like you did not\nmeet sooner. We should now have to mourn for one or other of you; but,\nthanks to God, who has prevented it, there is nothing more to fear. When\none forgets his hatred to plunge into mechanical problems and the other\nto play tricks on spiders, their hatred cannot be dangerous to anybody.\"\n\nAnd Michel Ardan related the captain's story to the president.\n\n\"I ask you now,\" said he as he concluded, \"if two good beings like you\nwere made to break each other's heads with gunshots?\"\n\nThere was in this rather ridiculous situation something so unexpected,\nthat Barbicane and Nicholl did not know how to look at one another.\nMichel Ardan felt this, and resolved to try for a reconciliation.\n\n\"My brave friends,\" said he, smiling in his most fascinating manner, \"it\nhas all been a mistake between you, nothing more. Well, to prove that\nall is ended between you, and as you are men who risk your lives,\nfrankly accept the proposition that I am going to make to you.\"\n\n\"Speak,\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"Friend Barbicane believes that his projectile will go straight to the\nmoon.\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly,\" replied the president.\n\n\"And friend Nicholl is persuaded that it will fall back on the earth.\"\n\n\"I am certain of it,\" cried the captain.\n\n\"Good,\" resumed Michel Ardan. \"I do not pretend to make you agree; all I\nsay to you is, 'Come with me, and see if we shall stop on the road.'\"\n\n\"What?\" said J.T. Maston, stupefied.\n\nThe two rivals at this sudden proposition had raised their eyes and\nlooked at each other attentively. Barbicane waited for Captain Nicholl's\nanswer; Nicholl awaited the president's reply.\n\n\"Well,\" said Michel in his most engaging tone, \"as there is now no shock\nto fear----\"\n\n\"Accepted!\" cried Barbicane.\n\nBut although this word was uttered very quickly, Nicholl had finished it\nat the same time.\n\n\"Hurrah! bravo!\" cried Michel Ardan, holding out his hands to the two\nadversaries. \"And now that the affair is arranged, my friends, allow me\nto treat you French fashion. _Allons d\u00e9jeuner_.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nTHE NEW CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n\nThat day all America heard about the duel and its singular termination.\nThe part played by the chivalrous European, his unexpected proposition\nwhich solved the difficulty, the simultaneous acceptation of the two\nrivals, that conquest of the lunar continent to which France and the\nUnited States were going to march in concert--everything tended to\nincrease Michel Ardan's popularity. It is well known how enthusiastic\nthe Yankees will get about an individual. In a country where grave\nmagistrates harness themselves to a dancer's carriage and draw it in\ntriumph, it may be judged how the bold Frenchman was treated. If they\ndid not take out his horses it was probably because he had none, but all\nother marks of enthusiasm were showered upon him. There was no citizen\nwho did not join him heart and mind:--_Ex pluribus unam_, according to\nthe motto of the United States.\n\nFrom that day Michel Ardan had not a minute's rest. Deputations from all\nparts of the Union worried him incessantly. He was forced to receive\nthem whether he would or no. The hands he shook could not be counted; he\nwas soon completely worn out, his voice became hoarse in consequence of\nhis innumerable speeches, and only escaped from his lips in\nunintelligible sounds, and he nearly caught a gastro-enterite after the\ntoasts he proposed to the Union. This success would have intoxicated\nanother man from the first, but he managed to stay in a _spirituelle_\nand charming demi-inebriety.\n\nAmongst the deputations of every sort that assailed him, that of the\n\"Lunatics\" did not forget what they owed to the future conqueror of the\nmoon. One day some of these poor creatures, numerous enough in America,\nwent to him and asked to return with him to their native country. Some\nof them pretended to speak \"Selenite,\" and wished to teach it to Michel\nArdan, who willingly lent himself to their innocent mania, and promised\nto take their messages to their friends in the moon.\n\n\"Singular folly!\" said he to Barbicane, after having dismissed them;\n\"and a folly that often takes possession of men of great intelligence.\nOne of our most illustrious _savants_, Arago, told me that many very\nwise and reserved people in their conceptions became much excited and\ngave way to incredible singularities every time the moon occupied them.\nDo you believe in the influence of the moon upon maladies?\"\n\n\"Very little,\" answered the president of the Gun Club.\n\n\"I do not either, and yet history has preserved some facts that, to say\nthe least, are astonishing. Thus in 1693, during an epidemic, people\nperished in the greatest numbers on the 21st of January, during an\neclipse. The celebrated Bacon fainted during the moon eclipses, and only\ncame to himself after its entire emersion. King Charles VI. relapsed six\ntimes into madness during the year 1399, either at the new or full moon.\nPhysicians have ranked epilepsy amongst the maladies that follow the\nphases of the moon. Nervous maladies have often appeared to be\ninfluenced by it. Mead speaks of a child who had convulsions when the\nmoon was in opposition. Gall remarked that insane persons underwent an\naccession of their disorder twice in every month, at the epochs of the\nnew and full moon. Lastly, a thousand observations of this sort made\nupon malignant fevers and somnambulism tend to prove that the Queen of\nNight has a mysterious influence upon terrestrial maladies.\"\n\n\"But how? why?\" asked Barbicane.\n\n\"Why?\" answered Ardan. \"Why, the only thing I can tell you is what Arago\nrepeated nineteen centuries after Plutarch. Perhaps it is because it is\nnot true.\"\n\nIn the height of his triumph Michel Ardan could not escape any of the\nannoyances incidental to a celebrated man. Managers of entertainments\nwished to exhibit him. Barnum offered him a million dollars to show him\nas a curious animal in the different towns of the United States.\n\nStill, though he refused to satisfy public curiosity in that way, his\nportraits went all over the world, and occupied the place of honour in\nalbums; proofs were made of all sizes from life size to medallions.\nEvery one could possess the hero in all positions--head, bust, standing,\nfull-face, profile, three-quarters, back. Fifteen hundred thousand\ncopies were taken, and it would have been a fine occasion to get money\nby relics, but he did not profit by it. If he had sold his hairs for a\ndollar apiece there would have remained enough to make his fortune!\n\nTo tell the truth, this popularity did not displease him. On the\ncontrary, he put himself at the disposition of the public, and\ncorresponded with the entire universe. They repeated his witticisms,\nespecially those he did not perpetrate.\n\nNot only had he all the men for him, but the women too. What an infinite\nnumber of good marriages he might have made if he had taken a fancy to\n\"settle!\" Old maids especially dreamt before his portraits day and\nnight.\n\nIt is certain that he would have found female companions by hundreds,\neven if he had imposed the condition of following him up into the air.\nWomen are intrepid when they are not afraid of everything. But he had no\nintention of transplanting a race of Franco-Americans upon the lunar\ncontinent, so he refused.\n\n\"I do not mean,\" said he, \"to play the part of Adam with a daughter of\nEve up there. I might meet with serpents!\"\n\nAs soon as he could withdraw from the joys of triumph, too often\nrepeated, he went with his friends to pay a visit to the Columbiad. He\nowed it that. Besides, he was getting very learned in ballistics since\nhe had lived with Barbicane, J.T. Maston, and _tutti quanti_. His\ngreatest pleasure consisted in repeating to these brave artillerymen\nthat they were only amiable and learned murderers. He was always joking\nabout it. The day he visited the Columbiad he greatly admired it, and\nwent down to the bore of the gigantic mortar that was soon to hurl him\ntowards the Queen of Night.\n\n\"At least,\" said he, \"that cannon will not hurt anybody, which is\nalready very astonishing on the part of a cannon. But as to your engines\nthat destroy, burn, smash, and kill, don't talk to me about them!\"\n\nIt is necessary to report here a proposition made by J.T. Maston. When\nthe secretary of the Gun Club heard Barbicane and Nicholl accept Michel\nArdan's proposition he resolved to join them, and make a party of four.\nOne day he asked to go. Barbicane, grieved at having to refuse, made him\nunderstand that the projectile could not carry so many passengers. J.T.\nMaston, in despair, went to Michel Ardan, who advised him to be\nresigned, adding one or two arguments _ad hominem_.\n\n\"You see, old fellow,\" he said to him, \"you must not be offended, but\nreally, between ourselves, you are too incomplete to present yourself in\nthe moon.\"\n\n\"Incomplete!\" cried the valiant cripple.\n\n\"Yes, my brave friend. Suppose we should meet with inhabitants up there.\nDo you want to give them a sorry idea of what goes on here, teach them\nwhat war is, show them that we employ the best part of our time in\ndevouring each other and breaking arms and limbs, and that upon a globe\nthat could feed a hundred thousand millions of inhabitants, and where\nthere are hardly twelve hundred millions? Why, my worthy friend, you\nwould have us shown to the door!\"\n\n\"But if you arrive smashed to pieces,\" replied J.T. Maston, \"you will be\nas incomplete as I.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered Michel Ardan, \"but we shall not arrive in pieces.\"\n\nIn fact, a preparatory experiment, tried on the 18th of October, had\nbeen attended with the best results, and given rise to the most\nlegitimate hopes. Barbicane, wishing to know the effect of the shock at\nthe moment of the projectile's departure, sent for a 32-inch mortar from\nPensacola Arsenal. It was installed upon the quay of Hillisboro Harbour,\nin order that the bomb might fall into the sea, and the shock of its\nfall be deadened. He only wished to experiment upon the shock of its\ndeparture, not that of its arrival.\n\nA hollow projectile was prepared with the greatest care for this curious\nexperiment. A thick wadding put upon a network of springs made of the\nbest steel lined it inside. It was quite a wadded nest.\n\n\"What a pity one can't go in it!\" said J.T. Maston, regretting that his\nsize did not allow him to make the venture.\n\nInto this charming bomb, which was closed by means of a lid, screwed\ndown, they put first a large cat, then a squirrel belonging to the\nperpetual secretary of the Gun Club, which J.T. Maston was very fond of.\nBut they wished to know how this little animal, not likely to be giddy,\nwould support this experimental journey.\n\nThe mortar was loaded with 160 lbs. of powder and the bomb. It was then\nfired.\n\nThe projectile immediately rose with rapidity, described a majestic\nparabola, attained a height of about a thousand feet, and then with a\ngraceful curve fell into the waves.\n\nWithout losing an instant, a vessel was sent to the spot where it fell;\nskilful divers sank under water and fastened cable-chains to the handles\nof the bomb, which was rapidly hoisted on board. Five minutes had not\nelapsed between the time the animals were shut up and the unscrewing of\ntheir prison lid.\n\nArdan, Barbicane, Maston, and Nicholl were upon the vessel, and they\nassisted at the operation with a sentiment of interest easy to\nunderstand. The bomb was hardly opened before the cat sprang out, rather\nbruised but quite lively, and not looking as if it had just returned\nfrom an a\u00ebrial expedition. But nothing, was seen of the squirrel. The\ntruth was then discovered. The cat had eaten its travelling companion.\n\nJ.T. Maston was very grieved at the loss of his poor squirrel, and\nproposed to inscribe it in the martyrology of science.\n\nHowever that may be, after this experiment all hesitation and fear were\nat an end; besides, Barbicane's plans were destined further to perfect\nthe projectile, and destroy almost entirely the effect of the shock.\nThere was nothing more to do but to start.\n\nTwo days later Michel Ardan received a message from the President of\nthe Union, an honour which he much appreciated.\n\nAfter the example of his chivalrous countryman, La Fayette, the\ngovernment had bestowed upon him the title of \"Citizen of the United\nStates of America.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nTHE PROJECTILE COMPARTMENT.\n\n\nAfter the celebrated Columbiad was completed public interest immediately\ncentred upon the projectile, the new vehicle destined to transport the\nthree bold adventurers across space. No one had forgotten that in his\ndespatch of September 30th Michel Ardan asked for a modification of the\nplans laid out by the members of the committee.\n\nPresident Barbicane then thought with reason that the form of the\nprojectile was of slight importance, for, after crossing the atmosphere\nin a few seconds, it would meet with vacuum. The committee had therefore\nchosen the round form, so that the ball might turn over and over and do\nas it liked. But as soon as it had to be made into a vehicle, that was\nanother thing. Michel Ardan did not want to travel squirrel-fashion; he\nwished to go up head up and feet down with as much dignity as in the car\nof a balloon, quicker of course, but without unseemly gambols.\n\nNew plans were, therefore, sent to the firm of Breadwill and Co., of\nAlbany, with the recommendation to execute them without delay. The\nprojectile, thus modified, was cast on the 2nd of November, and sent\nimmediately to Stony Hill by the Eastern Railway.\n\nOn the 10th it arrived without accident at its place of destination.\nMichel Ardan, Barbicane, and Nicholl awaited with the most lively\nimpatience this \"projectile compartment\" in which they were to take\ntheir passage for the discovery of a new world.\n\nIt must be acknowledged that it was a magnificent piece of metal, a\nmetallurgic production that did the greatest honour to the industrial\ngenius of the Americans. It was the first time that aluminium had been\nobtained in so large a mass, which result might be justly regarded as\nprodigious. This precious projectile sparkled in the rays of the sun.\nSeeing it in its imposing shape with its conical top, it might easily\nhave been taken for one of those extinguisher-shaped towers that\narchitects of the Middle Ages put at the angles of their castles. It\nonly wanted loopholes and a weathercock.\n\n\"I expect,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"to see a man armed _cap-\u00e0-pie_ come\nout of it. We shall be like feudal lords in there; with a little\nartillery we could hold our own against a whole army of Selenites--that\nis, if there are any in the moon!\"\n\n\"Then the vehicle pleases you?\" asked Barbicane.\n\n\"Yes, yes! certainly,\" answered Michel Ardan, who was examining it as an\nartist. \"I only regret that its form is not a little more slender, its\ncone more graceful; it ought to be terminated by a metal group, some\nGothic ornament, a salamander escaping from it with outspread wings and\nopen beak.\"\n\n\"What would be the use?\" said Barbicane, whose positive mind was little\nsensitive to the beauties of art.\n\n\"Ah, friend Barbicane, I am afraid you will never understand the use, or\nyou would not ask!\"\n\n\"Well, tell me, at all events, my brave companion.\"\n\n\"Well, my friend, I think we ought always to put a little art in all we\ndo. Do you know an Indian play called _The Child's Chariot_?\"\n\n\"Not even by name,\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"I am not surprised at that,\" continued Michel Ardan. \"Learn, then, that\nin that play there is a robber who, when in the act of piercing the wall\nof a house, stops to consider whether he shall make his hole in the\nshape of a lyre, a flower, or a bird. Well, tell me, friend Barbicane,\nif at that epoch you had been his judge would you have condemned that\nrobber?\"\n\n\"Without hesitation,\" answered the president of the Gun Club, \"and as a\nburglar too.\"\n\n\"Well, I should have acquitted him, friend Barbicane. That is why you\ncould never understand me.\"\n\n\"I will not even try, my valiant artist.\"\n\n\"But, at least,\" continued Michel Ardan, \"as the exterior of our\nprojectile compartment leaves much to be desired, I shall be allowed to\nfurnish the inside as I choose, and with all luxury suitable to\nambassadors from the earth.\"\n\n\"About that, my brave Michel,\" answered Barbicane, \"you can do entirely\nas you please.\"\n\nBut before passing to the agreeable the president of the Gun Club had\nthought of the useful, and the means he had invented for lessening the\neffects of the shock were applied with perfect intelligence.\n\nBarbicane had said to himself, not unreasonably, that no spring would be\nsufficiently powerful to deaden the shock, and during his famous\npromenade in Skersnaw Wood he had ended by solving this great difficulty\nin an ingenious fashion. He depended upon water to render him this\nsignal service. This is how:--\n\nThe projectile was to be filled to the depth of three feet with water\ndestined to support a water-tight wooden disc, which easily worked\nwithin the walls of the projectile. It was upon this raft that the\ntravellers were to take their place. As to the liquid mass, it was\ndivided by horizontal partitions which the departing shock would\nsuccessively break; then each sheet of water, from the lowest to the\nhighest, escaping by valves in the upper part of the projectile, thus\nmaking a spring, and the disc, itself furnished with extremely powerful\nbuffers, could not strike the bottom until it had successively broken\nthe different partitions. The travellers would doubtless feel a violent\nrecoil after the complete escape of the liquid mass, but the first shock\nwould be almost entirely deadened by so powerful a spring.\n\nIt is true that three feet on a surface of 541 square feet would weigh\nnearly 11,500 lbs; but the escape of gas accumulated in the Columbiad\nwould suffice, Barbicane thought to conquer that increase of weight;\nbesides, the shock would send out all that water in less than a second,\nand the projectile would soon regain its normal weight.\n\nThis is what the president of the Gun Club had imagined, and how he\nthought he had solved the great question of the recoil. This work,\nintelligently comprehended by the engineers of the Breadwill firm, was\nmarvellously executed; the effect once produced and the water gone, the\ntravellers could easily get rid of the broken partitions and take away\nthe mobile disc that bore them at the moment of departure.\n\nAs to the upper sides of the projectile, they were lined with a thick\nwadding of leather, put upon the best steel springs as supple as\nwatch-springs. The escape-pipes hidden under this wadding were not even\nseen.\n\nAll imaginable precautions for deadening the first shock having been\ntaken, Michel Ardan said they must be made of \"very bad stuff\" to be\ncrushed.\n\nThe projectile outside was nine feet wide and twelve feet high. In order\nnot to pass the weight assigned the sides had been made a little less\nthick and the bottom thicker, as it would have to support all the\nviolence of the gases developed by the deflagration of the pyroxyle.\nBombs and cylindro-conical howitzers are always made with thicker\nbottoms.\n\nThe entrance to this tower of metal was a narrow opening in the wall of\nthe cone, like the \"man-hole\" of steam boilers. It closed hermetically\nby means of an aluminium plate fastened inside by powerful screw\npressure. The travellers could therefore leave their mobile prison at\nwill as soon as they had reached the Queen of Night.\n\nBut going was not everything; it was necessary to see on the road.\nNothing was easier. In fact, under the wadding were four thick\nlenticular footlights, two let into the circular wall of the projectile,\nthe third in its lower part, and the fourth in its cone. The travellers\ncould, therefore, observe during their journey the earth they were\nleaving, the moon they were approaching, and the constellated spaces of\nthe sky. These skylights were protected against the shocks of departure\nby plates let into solid grooves, which it was easy to move by\nunscrewing them. By that means the air contained in the projectile could\nnot escape, and it was possible to make observations.\n\nAll these mechanical appliances, admirably set, worked with the greatest\nease, and the engineers had not shown themselves less intelligent in the\narrangement of the projectile compartment.\n\nLockers solidly fastened were destined to contain the water and\nprovisions necessary for the three travellers; they could even procure\nthemselves fire and light by means of gas stored up in a special case\nunder a pressure of several atmospheres. All they had to do was to turn\na tap, and the gas would light and warm this comfortable vehicle for six\ndays. It will be seen that none of the things essential to life, or even\nto comfort, were wanting. More, thanks to the instincts of Michel Ardan,\nthe agreeable was joined to the useful under the form of objects of art;\nhe would have made a veritable artist's studio of his projectile if room\nhad not been wanting. It would be mistaken to suppose that three persons\nwould be restricted for space in that metal tower. It had a surface of\n54 square feet, and was nearly 10 feet high, and allowed its occupiers a\ncertain liberty of movement. They would not have been so much at their\nease in the most comfortable railway compartment of the United States.\n\nThe question of provisions and lighting having been solved, there\nremained the question of air. It was evident that the air confined in\nthe projectile would not be sufficient for the travellers' respiration\nfor four days; each man, in fact, consumes in one hour all the oxygen\ncontained in 100 litres of air. Barbicane, his two companions, and two\ndogs that he meant to take, would consume every twenty-four hours 2,400\nlitres of oxygen, or a weight equal to 7 lbs. The air in the projectile\nmust, therefore, be renewed. How? By a very simple method, that of\nMessrs. Reiset and Regnault, indicated by Michel Ardan during the\ndiscussion of the meeting.\n\nIt is known that the air is composed principally of twenty-one parts of\noxygen and seventy-nine parts of azote. Now what happens in the act of\nrespiration? A very simple phenomenon, Man absorbs the oxygen of the\nair, eminently adapted for sustaining life, and throws out the azote\nintact. The air breathed out has lost nearly five per cent, of its\noxygen, and then contains a nearly equal volume of carbonic acid, the\ndefinitive product of the combustion of the elements of the blood by the\noxygen breathed in it. It happens, therefore, that in a confined space\nand after a certain time all the oxygen of the air is replaced by\ncarbonic acid, an essentially deleterious gas.\n\nThe question was then reduced to this, the azote being conserved\nintact--1. To remake the oxygen absorbed; 2. To destroy the carbonic\nacid breathed out. Nothing easier to do by means of chlorate of potash\nand caustic potash. The former is a salt which appears under the form of\nwhite crystals; when heated to a temperature of 400\u00b0 it is transformed\ninto chlorine of potassium, and the oxygen which it contains is given\noff freely. Now 18 lbs. of chlorate of potash give 7 lbs of oxygen--that\nis to say, the quantity necessary to the travellers for twenty-four\nhours.\n\nAs to caustic potash, it has a great affinity for carbonic acid mixed in\nair, and it is sufficient to shake it in order for it to seize upon the\nacid and form bicarbonate of potash. So much for the absorption of\ncarbonic acid.\n\nBy combining these two methods they were certain of giving back to\nvitiated air all its life-giving qualities. The two chemists, Messrs.\nReiset and Regnault, had made the experiment with success.\n\nBut it must be said the experiment had only been made _in anima vili_.\nWhatever its scientific accuracy might be, no one knew how man could\nbear it.\n\nSuch was the observation made at the meeting where this grave question\nwas discussed. Michel Ardan meant to leave no doubt about the\npossibility of living by means of this artificial air, and he offered to\nmake the trial before the departure.\n\nBut the honour of putting it to the proof was energetically claimed by\nJ.T. Maston.\n\n\"As I am not going with you,\" said the brave artilleryman, \"the least I\ncan do will be to live in the projectile for a week.\"\n\nIt would have been ungracious to refuse him. His wish was complied with.\nA sufficient quantity of chlorate of potash and caustic potash was\nplaced at his disposition, with provisions for a week; then having\nshaken hands with his friends, on the 12th of November at 6 a.m., after\nhaving expressly recommended them not to open his prison before the 20th\nat 6 p.m., he crept into the projectile, the iron plate of which was\nhermetically shut.\n\nWhat happened during that week? It was impossible to ascertain. The\nthickness of the projectile's walls prevented any interior noise from\nreaching the outside.\n\nOn the 20th of November, at six o'clock precisely, the plate was\nremoved; the friends of J.T. Maston were rather uneasy. But they were\npromptly reassured by hearing a joyful voice shouting a formidable\nhurrah!\n\nThe secretary of the Gun Club appeared on the summit of the cone in a\ntriumphant attitude.\n\nHe had grown fat!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nTHE TELESCOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.\n\n\nOn the 20th of October of the preceding year, after the subscription\nlist was closed, the president of the Gun Club had credited the\nCambridge Observatory with the sums necessary for the construction of a\nvast optical instrument. This telescope was to be powerful enough to\nrender visible on the surface of the moon an object being at least nine\nfeet wide.\n\nThere is an important difference between a field-glass and a telescope,\nwhich it is well to recall here. A field-glass is composed of a tube\nwhich carries at its upper extremity a convex glass called an\nobject-glass, and at its lower extremity a second glass called ocular,\nto which the eye of the observer is applied. The rays from the luminous\nobject traverse the first glass, and by refraction form an image upside\ndown at its focus. This image is looked at with the ocular, which\nmagnifies it. The tube of the field-glass is, therefore, closed at each\nextremity by the object and the ocular glasses.\n\nThe telescope, on the contrary, is open at its upper extremity. The rays\nfrom the object observed penetrate freely into it, and strike a concave\nmetallic mirror--that is to say, they are focussed. From thence their\nreflected rays meet with a little mirror, which sends them back to the\nocular in such a way as to magnify the image produced.\n\nThus in field-glasses refraction plays the principal part, and\nreflection does in the telescope. Hence the name of refractors given to\nthe former, and reflectors given to the latter. All the difficulty in\nthe execution of these optical instruments lies in the making of the\nobject-glass, whether they be made of glass or metallic mirrors.\n\nStill at the epoch when the Gun Club made its great experiment these\ninstruments were singularly perfected and gave magnificent results. The\ntime was far distant when Galileo observed the stars with his poor\nglass, which magnified seven times at the most. Since the 16th century\noptical instruments had widened and lengthened in considerable\nproportions, and they allowed the stellar spaces to be gauged to a depth\nunknown before. Amongst the refracting instruments at work at that\nperiod were the glass of the Poulkowa Observatory in Russia, the\nobject-glass of which measured 15 inches in width, that of the French\noptician Lerebours, furnished with an object-glass equally large, and\nlastly that of the Cambridge Observatory, furnished with an object-glass\n19 inches in diameter.\n\nAmongst telescopes, two were known of remarkable power and gigantic\ndimensions. The first, constructed by Herschel, was 36 feet in length,\nand had an object-glass of 4 feet 6 inches; it magnified 6,000 times;\nthe second, raised in Ireland, at Birrcastle, in Parsonstown Park,\nbelonged to Lord Rosse; the length of its tube was 48 feet and the width\nof its mirror 6 feet; it magnified 6,400 times, and it had required an\nimmense erection of masonry on which to place the apparatus necessary\nfor working the instrument, which weighed 12-1/2 tons.\n\nBut it will be seen that notwithstanding these colossal dimensions the\nmagnifying power obtained did not exceed 6,000 times in round numbers;\nnow that power would only bring the moon within 39 miles, and would only\nallow objects 60 feet in diameter to be perceived unless these objects\nwere very elongated.\n\nNow in space they had to deal with a projectile 9 feet wide and 15 long,\nso the moon had to be brought within five miles at least, and for that a\nmagnifying power of 48,000 times was necessary.\n\nSuch was the problem propounded to the Cambridge Observatory. They were\nnot to be stopped by financial difficulties, so there only remained\nmaterial difficulties.\n\nFirst of all they had to choose between telescopes and field-glasses.\nThe latter had some advantages. With equal object-glasses they have a\ngreater magnifying power, because the luminous rays that traverse the\nglasses lose less by absorption than the reflection on the metallic\nmirror of telescopes; but the thickness that can be given to glass is\nlimited, for too thick it does not allow the luminous rays to pass.\nBesides, the construction of these vast glasses is excessively\ndifficult, and demands a considerable time, measured by years.\n\nTherefore, although images are better given by glasses, an inappreciable\nadvantage when the question is to observe the moon, the light of which\nis simply reflected they decided to employ the telescope, which is\nprompter in execution and is capable of a greater magnifying power; only\nas the luminous rays lose much of their intensity by traversing the\natmosphere, the Gun Club resolved to set up the instrument on one of the\nhighest mountains of the Union, which would diminish the depth of the\na\u00ebrial strata.\n\nIn telescopes it has been seen that the glass placed at the observer's\neye produces the magnifying power, and the object-glass which bears this\npower the best is the one that has the largest diameter and the greatest\nfocal distance. In order to magnify 48,000 times it must be much larger\nthan those of Herschel and Lord Rosse. There lay the difficulty, for the\ncasting of these mirrors is a very delicate operation.\n\nHappily, some years before a _savant_ of the _Institut de France_, L\u00e9on\nFoucault, had just invented means by which the polishing of\nobject-glasses became very prompt and easy by replacing the metallic\nmirror by taking a piece of glass the size required and plating it.\n\nIt was to be fixed according to the method invented by Herschel for\ntelescopes. In the great instrument of the astronomer at Slough, the\nimage of objects reflected by the mirror inclined at the bottom of the\ntube was formed at the other extremity where the eyeglass was placed.\nThus the observer, instead of being placed at the lower end of the tube,\nwas hoisted to the upper end, and there with his eyeglass he looked down\ninto the enormous cylinder. This combination had the advantage of doing\naway with the little mirror destined to send back the image to the\nocular glass, which thus only reflected once instead of twice; therefore\nthere were fewer luminous rays extinguished, the image was less feeble,\nand more light was obtained, a precious advantage in the observation\nthat was to be made.\n\nThis being resolved upon, the work was begun. According to the\ncalculations of the Cambridge Observatory staff, the tube of the new\nreflector was to be 280 feet long and its mirror 16 feet in diameter.\nAlthough it was so colossal it was not comparable to the telescope\n10,000 feet long which the astronomer Hooke proposed to construct some\nyears ago. Nevertheless the setting up of such an apparatus presented\ngreat difficulties.\n\nThe question of its site was promptly settled. It must be upon a high\nmountain, and high mountains are not numerous in the States.\n\nIn fact, the orographical system of this great country only contains two\nchains of average height, amongst which flows the magnificent\nMississippi, which the Americans would call the \"king of rivers\" if they\nadmitted any royalty whatever.\n\nOn the east rise the Apalachians, the very highest point of which, in\nNew Hampshire, does not exceed the very moderate altitude of 5,600 feet.\n\nOn the west are, however, the Rocky Mountains, that immense chain which\nbegins at the Straits of Magellan, follows the west coast of South\nAmerica under the name of the Andes or Cordilleras, crosses the Isthmus\nof Panama, and runs up the whole of North America to the very shores of\nthe Polar Sea.\n\nThese mountains are not very high, and the Alps or Himalayas would look\ndown upon them with disdain. In fact, their highest summit is only\n10,701 feet high, whilst Mont Blanc is 14,439, and the highest summit of\nthe Himalayas is 26,776 feet above the level of the sea.\n\nBut as the Gun Club wished that its telescope, as well as the Columbiad,\nshould be set up in the States of the Union, they were obliged to be\ncontent with the Rocky Mountains, and all the necessary material was\nsent to the summit of Long's Peak in the territory of Missouri.\n\nNeither pen nor language could relate the difficulties of every kind\nthat the American engineers had to overcome, and the prodigies of\naudacity and skill that they accomplished. Enormous stones, massive\npieces of wrought-iron, heavy corner-clamps, and huge portions of\ncylinder had to be raised with an object-glass, weighing nearly 30,000\nlbs., above the line of perpetual snow for more than 10,000 feet in\nheight, after crossing desert prairies, impenetrable forests, fearful\nrapids far from all centres of population, and in the midst of savage\nregions in which every detail of life becomes an insoluble problem, and,\nnevertheless, American genius triumphed over all these obstacles. Less\nthan a year after beginning the works in the last days of the month of\nSeptember, the gigantic reflector rose in the air to a height of 280\nfeet. It was hung from an enormous iron scaffolding; an ingenious\narrangement allowed it to be easily moved towards every point of the\nsky, and to follow the stars from one horizon to the other during their\njourney across space.\n\nIt had cost more than 400,000 dollars. The first time it was pointed at\nthe moon the observers felt both curious and uneasy. What would they\ndiscover in the field of this telescope which magnified objects 48,000\ntimes? Populations, flocks of lunar animals, towns, lakes, and oceans?\nNo, nothing that science was not already acquainted with, and upon all\npoints of her disc the volcanic nature of the moon could be determined\nwith absolute precision.\n\nBut the telescope of the Rocky Mountains, before being used by the Gun\nClub, rendered immense services to astronomy. Thanks to its power of\npenetration, the depths of the sky were explored to their utmost limits,\nthe apparent diameter of a great number of stars could be rigorously\nmeasured, and Mr. Clarke, of the Cambridge staff, resolved the Crab\nnebula in Taurus, which Lord Rosse's reflector had never been able to\ndo.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nFINAL DETAILS.\n\n\nIt was the 22nd of November. The supreme departure was to take place ten\ndays later. One operation still remained to bring it to a happy\ntermination, a delicate and perilous operation exacting infinite\nprecautions, and against the success of which Captain Nicholl had laid\nhis third bet. It was, in fact, nothing less than the loading of the gun\nand the introduction into it of 400,000 lbs. of gun-cotton. Nicholl had\nthought, not without reason, perhaps, that the handling of so large a\nquantity of pyroxyle would cause grave catastrophes, and that in any\ncase this eminently explosive mass would ignite of itself under the\npressure of the projectile.\n\nThere were also grave dangers increased by the carelessness of the\nAmericans, who, during the Federal war, used to load their cannon cigar\nin mouth. But Barbicane had set his heart on succeeding, and did not\nmean to founder in port; he therefore chose his best workmen, made them\nwork under his superintendence, and by dint of prudence and precautions\nhe managed to put all the chances of success on his side.\n\nFirst he took care not to bring all his charge at once to the inclosure\nof Stony Hill. He had it brought little by little carefully packed in\nsealed cases. The 400,000 lbs. of pyroxyle had been divided into packets\nof 500 lbs., which made 800 large cartridges made carefully by the\ncleverest artisans of Pensacola. Each case contained ten, and they\narrived one after the other by the railroad of Tampa Town; by that means\nthere were never more than 500 lbs. of pyroxyle at once in the\ninclosure. As soon as it arrived each case was unloaded by workmen\nwalking barefoot, and each cartridge transported to the orifice of the\nColumbiad, into which they lowered them by means of cranes worked by the\nmen. Every steam-engine had been excluded, and the least fires\nextinguished for two miles round. Even in November it was necessary to\npreserve this gun-cotton from the ardour of the sun. So they worked at\nnight by light produced in a vacuum by means of R\u00fchmkorff's apparatus,\nwhich threw an artificial brightness into the depths of the Columbiad.\nThere the cartridges were arranged with the utmost regularity, fastened\ntogether by a wire destined to communicate the electric spark to them\nall simultaneously.\n\nIn fact, it was by means of electricity that fire was to be set to this\nmass of gun-cotton. All these single wires, surrounded by isolating\nmaterial, were rolled into a single one at a narrow hole pierced at the\nheight the projectile was to be placed; there they crossed the thick\nmetal wall and came up to the surface by one of the vent-holes in the\nmasonry made on purpose. Once arrived at the summit of Stony Hill, the\nwire supported on poles for a distance of two miles met a powerful pile\nof Bunsen passing through a non-conducting apparatus. It would,\ntherefore, be enough to press with the finger the knob of the apparatus\nfor the electric current to be at once established, and to set fire to\nthe 400,000 lbs. of gun-cotton. It is hardly necessary to say that this\nwas only to be done at the last moment.\n\nOn the 28th of November the 800 cartridges were placed at the bottom of\nthe Columbiad. That part of the operation had succeeded. But what worry,\nanxiety, and struggles President Barbicane had to undergo! In vain had\nhe forbidden entrance to Stony Hill; every day curious sightseers\nclimbed over the palisading, and some, pushing imprudence to folly, came\nand smoked amongst the bales of gun-cotton. Barbicane put himself into\ndaily rages. J.T. Maston seconded him to the best of his ability,\nchasing the intruders away and picking up the still-lighted cigar-ends\nwhich the Yankees threw about--a rude task, for more than 300,000 people\npressed round the palisades. Michel Ardan had offered himself to escort\nthe cases to the mouth of the gun, but having caught him with a cigar in\nhis mouth whilst he drove out the intruders to whom he was giving this\nunfortunate example, the president of the Gun Club saw that he could not\ndepend upon this intrepid smoker, and was obliged to have him specially\nwatched.\n\nAt last, there being a Providence even for artillerymen, nothing blew\nup, and the loading was happily terminated. The third bet of Captain\nNicholl was therefore much imperilled. There still remained the work of\nintroducing the projectile into the Columbiad and placing it on the\nthick bed of gun-cotton.\n\nBut before beginning this operation the objects necessary for the\njourney were placed with order in the waggon-compartment. There were a\ngood many of them, and if they had allowed Michel Ardan to do as he\npleased he would soon have filled up all the space reserved for the\ntravellers. No one can imagine all that the amiable Frenchman wished to\ncarry to the moon--a heap of useless trifles. But Barbicane interfered,\nand refused all but the strictly necessary.\n\nSeveral thermometers, barometers, and telescopes were placed in the\ninstrument-case.\n\nThe travellers were desirous of examining the moon during their transit,\nand in order to facilitate the survey of this new world they took an\nexcellent map by Boeer and Moedler, the _Mappa Selenographica_,\npublished in four plates, which is justly looked upon as a masterpiece\nof patience and observation. It represented with scrupulous exactitude\nthe slightest details of that portion of the moon turned towards the\nearth. Mountains, valleys, craters, peaks, watersheds, were depicted on\nit in their exact dimensions, faithful positions, and names, from Mounts\nDoerfel and Leibnitz, whose highest summits rise on the eastern side of\nthe disc, to the _Mare Frigoris_, which extends into the North Polar\nregions.\n\nIt was, therefore, a precious document for the travellers, for they\ncould study the country before setting foot upon it.\n\nThey took also three rifles and three fowling-pieces with powder and\nshot in great quantity.\n\n\"We do not know with whom we may have to deal,\" said Michel Ardan. \"Both\nmen and beasts may be displeased at our visit; we must, therefore, take\nour precautions.\"\n\nThe instruments of personal defence were accompanied by pickaxes,\nspades, saws, and other indispensable tools, without mentioning garments\nsuitable to every temperature, from the cold of the polar regions to the\nheat of the torrid zone.\n\nMichel Ardan would have liked to take a certain number of animals of\ndifferent sorts, not male and female of every species, as he did not see\nthe necessity of acclimatising serpents, tigers, alligators, or any\nother noxious beasts in the moon.\n\n\"No,\" said he to Barbicane, \"but some useful animals, ox or cow, ass or\nhorse, would look well in the landscape and be of great use.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, my dear Ardan,\" answered the president of the Gun\nClub; \"but our projectile is not Noah's Ark. It differs both in\ndimensions and object, so let us remain in the bounds of possibility.\"\n\nAt last after long discussions it was agreed that the travellers should\nbe content to take with them an excellent sporting dog belonging to\nNicholl and a vigorous Newfoundland of prodigious strength. Several\ncases of the most useful seeds were included amongst the indispensable\nobjects. If they had allowed him, Michel Ardan would have taken several\nsacks of earth to sow them in. Any way he took a dozen little trees,\nwhich were carefully enveloped in straw and placed in a corner of the\nprojectile.\n\nThen remained the important question of provisions, for they were\nobliged to provide against finding the moon absolutely barren. Barbicane\nmanaged so well that he took enough for a year. But it must be added, to\nprevent astonishment, that these provisions consisted of meat and\nvegetable compressed to their smallest volume by hydraulic pressure, and\nincluded a great quantity of nutritive elements; there was not much\nvariety, but it would not do to be too particular in such an expedition.\nThere was also about fifty gallons of brandy and water for two months\nonly, for, according to the latest observations of astronomers, no one\ndoubted the presence of a large quantity of water in the moon. As to\nprovisions, it would have been insane to believe that the inhabitants of\nthe earth would not find food up there. Michel Ardan had no doubt about\nit. If he had he would not have gone.\n\n\"Besides,\" said he one day to his friends, \"we shall not be completely\nabandoned by our friends on earth, and they will take care not to forget\nus.\"\n\n\"No, certainly,\" answered J.T. Maston.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Nicholl.\n\n\"Nothing more simple,\" answered Ardan. \"Will not our Columbiad be still\nthere? Well, then, every time that the moon is in favourable conditions\nof zenith, if not of perigee--that is to say, about once a year--could\nthey not send us a projectile loaded with provisions which we should\nexpect by a fixed date?\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried J.T. Maston. \"That is not at all a bad idea. Certainly\nwe will not forget you.\"\n\n\"I depend upon you. Thus you see we shall have news regularly from the\nglobe, and for our part we shall be very awkward if we do not find means\nto communicate with our good friends on earth.\"\n\nThese words inspired such confidence that Michel Ardan with his superb\nassurance would have carried the whole Gun Club with him. What he said\nseemed simple, elementary, and sure of success, and it would have been\nsordid attachment to this earth to hesitate to follow the three\ntravellers upon their lunar expedition.\n\nWhen the different objects were placed in the projectile the water was\nintroduced between the partitions and the gas for lighting purposes laid\nin. Barbicane took enough chlorate of potash and caustic potash for two\nmonths, as he feared unforeseen delay. An extremely ingenious machine\nworking automatically put the elements for good air in motion. The\nprojectile, therefore, was ready, and the only thing left to do was to\nlower it into the gun, an operation full of perils and difficulty.\n\nThe enormous projectile was taken to the summit of Stony Hill. There\nenormous cranes seized it and held it suspended over the metal well.\n\nThis was an anxious moment. If the chains were to break under the\nenormous weight the fall of such a mass would inevitably ignite the\ngun-cotton.\n\nHappily nothing of the sort happened, and a few hours afterwards the\nprojectile-compartment rested on its pyroxyle bed, a veritable\nfulminating pillow. The only effect of its pressure was to ram the\ncharge of the gun more strongly.\n\n\"I have lost,\" said the captain, handing the sum of 3,000 dollars to\nPresident Barbicane.\n\nBarbicane did not wish to receive this money from his travelling\ncompanion, but he was obliged to give way to Nicholl, who wished to\nfulfil all his engagements before leaving the earth.\n\n\"Then,\" said Michel Ardan, \"there is but one thing I wish for you now,\ncaptain.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Nicholl.\n\n\"It is that you may lose your other two wagers. By that means we shall\nbe sure not to be stopped on the road.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nFIRE!\n\n\nThe 1st of December came, the fatal day, for if the projectile did not\nstart that very evening at 10h. 46m. and 40s. p.m., more than eighteen\nyears would elapse before the moon would present the same simultaneous\nconditions of zenith and perigee.\n\nThe weather was magnificent; notwithstanding the approach of winter the\nsun shone brightly and bathed in its radiance that earth which three of\nits inhabitants were about to leave for a new world.\n\nHow many people slept badly during the night that preceded the\nardently-longed-for day! How many breasts were oppressed with the heavy\nburden of waiting! All hearts beat with anxiety except only the heart of\nMichel Ardan. This impassible person went and came in his usual\nbusiness-like way, but nothing in him denoted any unusual preoccupation.\nHis sleep had been peaceful--it was the sleep of Turenne upon a\ngun-carriage the night before the battle.\n\nFrom early dawn an innumerable crowd covered the prairie, which extended\nas far as the eye could reach round Stony Hill. Every quarter of an hour\nthe railroad of Tampa brought fresh sightseers. According to the _Tampa\nTown Observer_, five millions of spectators were that day upon Floridian\nsoil.\n\nThe greater part of this crowd had been living in tents round the\ninclosure, and laid the foundations of a town which has since been\ncalled \"Ardan's Town.\" The ground bristled with huts, cabins, and tents,\nand these ephemeral habitations sheltered a population numerous enough\nto rival the largest cities of Europe.\n\nEvery nation upon earth was represented; every language was spoken at\nthe same time. It was like the confusion of tongues at the Tower of\nBabel. There the different classes of American society mixed in absolute\nequality. Bankers, cultivators, sailors, agents, merchants,\ncotton-planters, and magistrates elbowed each other with primitive ease.\nThe creoles of Louisiana fraternised with the farmers of Indiana; the\ngentlemen of Kentucky and Tennessee, the elegant and haughty Virginians,\njoked with the half-savage trappers of the Lakes and the butchers of\nCincinnati. They appeared in broad-brimmed white beavers and Panamas,\nblue cotton trousers, from the Opelousa manufactories, draped in elegant\nblouses of \u00e9cru cloth, in boots of brilliant colours, and extravagant\nshirt-frills; upon shirt-fronts, cuffs, cravats, on their ten fingers,\neven in their ears, an assortment of rings, pins, diamonds, chains,\nbuckles, and trinkets, the cost of which equalled the bad taste. Wife,\nchildren, servants, in no less rich dress, accompanied, followed,\npreceded, and surrounded their husbands, fathers, and masters, who\nresembled the patriarchs amidst their innumerable families.\n\nAt meal-times it was a sight to see all these people devour the dishes\npeculiar to the Southern States, and eat, with an appetite menacing to\nthe provisioning of Florida, the food that would be repugnant to a\nEuropean stomach, such as fricasseed frogs, monkey-flesh, fish-chowder,\nunderdone opossum, and raccoon steaks.\n\nThe liquors that accompanied this indigestible food were numerous.\nShouts and vociferations to buy resounded through the bar-rooms or\ntaverns, decorated with glasses, tankards, decanters, and bottles of\nmarvellous shapes, mortars for pounding sugar, and bundles of straws.\n\n\"Mint-julep!\" roars out one of the salesmen.\n\n\"Claret sangaree!\" shouts another through his nose.\n\n\"Gin-sling!\" shouts one.\n\n\"Cocktail! Brandy-smash!\" cries another.\n\n\"Who'll buy real mint-julep in the latest style?\" shouted these skilful\nsalesmen, rapidly passing from one glass to another the sugar, lemon,\ngreen mint, crushed ice, water, cognac, and fresh pine-apple which\ncompose this refreshing drink.\n\nGenerally these sounds, addressed to throats made thirsty by the spices\nthey consumed, mingled into one deafening roar. But on this 1st of\nDecember these cries were rare. No one thought of eating and drinking,\nand at 4 p.m. there were many spectators in the crowd who had not taken\ntheir customary lunch! A much more significant fact, even the national\npassion for gaming was allayed by the general emotion. Thimbles,\nskittles, and cards were left in their wrappings, and testified that the\ngreat event of the day absorbed all attention.\n\nUntil nightfall a dull, noiseless agitation like that which precedes\ngreat catastrophes ran through the anxious crowd. An indescribable\nuneasiness oppressed all minds, and stopped the beating of all hearts.\nEvery one wished it over.\n\nHowever, about seven o'clock this heavy silence was suddenly broken. The\nmoon rose above the horizon. Several millions of hurrahs saluted her\napparition. She was punctual to the appointment. Shouts of welcome broke\nfrom all parts, whilst the blonde Phoebe shone peacefully in a clear\nsky, and caressed the enraptured crowd with her most affectionate rays.\n\nAt that moment the three intrepid travellers appeared. When they\nappeared the cries redoubled in intensity. Unanimously, instantaneously,\nthe national song of the United States escaped from all the spectators,\nand \"Yankee Doodle,\" sung by 5,000,000 of hearty throats, rose like a\nroaring tempest to the farthest limits of the atmosphere.\n\nThen, after this irresistible outburst, the hymn was ended, the last\nharmonies died away by degrees, and a silent murmur floated over the\nprofoundly-excited crowd.\n\nIn the meantime the Frenchman and the two Americans had stepped into the\ninclosure round which the crowd was pressing. They were accompanied by\nthe members of the Gun Club, and deputations sent by the European\nobservatories. Barbicane was coolly and calmly giving his last orders.\nNicholl, with compressed lips and hands crossed behind his back, walked\nwith a firm and measured step. Michel Ardan, always at his ease, clothed\nin a perfect travelling suit, with leather gaiters on his legs, pouch at\nhis side, in vast garment of maroon velvet, a cigar in his mouth,\ndistributed shakes of the hand with princely prodigality. He was full of\ninexhaustible gaiety, laughing, joking, playing pranks upon the worthy\nJ.T. Maston, and was, in a word, \"French,\" and, what is worse,\n\"Parisian,\" till the last second.\n\nTen o'clock struck. The moment had come to take their places in the\nprojectile; the necessary mechanism for the descent the door-plate to\nscrew down, the removal of the cranes and scaffolding hung over the\nmouth of the Columbiad, took some time.\n\nBarbicane had set his chronometer to the tenth of a second by that of\nthe engineer Murchison, who was entrusted with setting fire to the\npowder by means of the electric spark; the travellers shut up in the\nprojectile could thus watch the impassive needle which was going to mark\nthe precise instant of their departure.\n\nThe moment for saying farewell had come. The scene was touching; in\nspite of his gaiety Michel Ardan felt touched. J.T. Maston had found\nunder his dry eyelids an ancient tear that he had, doubtless, kept for\nthe occasion. He shed it upon the forehead of his dear president.\n\n\"Suppose I go too?\" said he. \"There is still time!\"\n\n\"Impossible, old fellow,\" answered Barbicane.\n\nA few moments later the three travelling companions were installed in\nthe projectile, and had screwed down the door-plate, and the mouth of\nthe Columbiad, entirely liberated, rose freely towards the sky.\n\nNicholl, Barbicane, and Michel Ardan were definitively walled up in\ntheir metal vehicle.\n\nWho could predict the universal emotion then at its paroxysm?\n\nThe moon was rising in a firmament of limpid purity, outshining on her\npassage the twinkling fire of the stars; she passed over the\nconstellation of the Twins, and was now nearly halfway between the\nhorizon and the zenith.\n\nA frightful silence hung over all that scene. There was not a breath of\nwind on the earth! Not a sound of breathing from the crowd! Hearts dared\nnot beat. Every eye was fixed on the gaping mouth of the Columbiad.\n\nMurchison watched the needle of his chronometer. Hardly forty seconds\nhad to elapse before the moment of departure struck, and each one lasted\na century!\n\nAt the twentieth there was a universal shudder, and the thought occurred\nto all the crowd that the audacious travellers shut up in the vehicle\nwere likewise counting these terrible seconds! Some isolated cries were\nheard.\n\n\"Thirty-five!--thirty-six!--thirty-seven!--thirty--eight!--thirty-nine!\n--forty! Fire!!!\"\n\nMurchison immediately pressed his finger upon the electric knob and\nhurled the electric spark into the depths of the Columbiad.\n\nA fearful, unheard-of, superhuman report, of which nothing could give\nan idea, not even thunder or the eruption of volcanoes, was immediately\nproduced. An immense spout of fire sprang up from the bowels of the\nearth as if from a crater. The soil heaved and very few persons caught a\nglimpse of the projectile victoriously cleaving the air amidst the\nflaming smoke.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nCLOUDY WEATHER.\n\n\nAt the moment when the pyramid of flame rose to a prodigious height in\nthe air it lighted up the whole of Florida, and for an incalculable\nmoment day was substituted for night over a considerable extent of\ncountry. This immense column of fire was perceived for a hundred miles\nout at sea, from the Gulf and from the Atlantic, and more than one\nship's captain noted the apparition of this gigantic meteor in his\nlog-book.\n\nThe discharge of the Columbiad was accompanied by a veritable\nearthquake. Florida was shaken to its very depths. The gases of the\npowder, expanded by heat, forced back the atmospheric strata with\ntremendous violence, passing like a waterspout through the air.\n\nNot one spectator remained on his legs; men, women, and children were\nthrown down like ears of wheat in a storm; there was a terrible tumult,\nand a large number of people were seriously injured. J.T. Maston, who\nhad very imprudently kept to the fore, was thrown twenty yards backwards\nlike a bullet over the heads of his fellow-citizens. Three hundred\nthousand people were temporarily deafened and as though thunderstruck.\n\nThe atmospheric current, after throwing over huts and cabins, uprooting\ntrees within a radius of twenty miles, throwing the trains off the\nrailway as far as Tampa, burst upon the town like an avalanche and\ndestroyed a hundred houses, amongst others the church of St. Mary and\nthe new edifice of the Exchange. Some of the vessels in the port were\nrun against each other and sunk, and ten of them were stranded high and\ndry after breaking their chains like threads of cotton.\n\nBut the circle of these devastations extended farther still, and beyond\nthe limits of the United States. The recoil, aided by the westerly\nwinds, was felt on the Atlantic at more than 300 miles from the American\nshores. An unexpected tempest, which even Admiral Fitzroy could not have\nforeseen, broke upon the ships with unheard-of violence. Several\nvessels, seized by a sort of whirlwind before they had time to furl\ntheir sails, were sunk, amongst others the _Childe Harold_, of\nLiverpool, a regrettable catastrophe which was the object of lively\nrecriminations.\n\nLastly--although the fact is not warranted except by the affirmation of\na few natives--half-an-hour after the departure of the projectile the\ninhabitants of Sierra-Leone pretended that they heard a dull noise, the\nlast displacement of the sonorous waves, which, after crossing the\nAtlantic, died away on the African coast.\n\nBut to return to Florida. The tumult once lessened, the wounded and\ndeaf--in short, all the crowd--rose and shouted in a sort of frenzy,\n\"Hurrah for Ardan! Hurrah for Barbicane! Hurrah for Nicholl!\" Several\nmillions of men, nose in air, armed with telescopes and every species of\nfield-glass, looked into space, forgetting contusions and feelings, in\norder to look at the projectile. But they sought in vain; it was not to\nbe seen, and they resolved to await the telegrams from Long's Peak. The\ndirector of the Cambridge Observatory, M. Belfast, was at his post in\nthe Rocky Mountains, and it was to this skilful and persevering\nastronomer that the observations had been entrusted.\n\nBut an unforeseen phenomenon, against which nothing could be done, soon\ncame to put public impatience to a rude test.\n\nThe weather, so fine before, suddenly changed; the sky became covered\nwith clouds. It could not be otherwise after so great a displacement of\nthe atmospheric strata and the dispersion of the enormous quantity of\ngases from the combustion of 200,000 lbs. of pyroxyle. All natural order\nhad been disturbed. There is nothing astonishing in that, for in\nsea-fights it has been noticed that the state of the atmosphere has been\nsuddenly changed by the artillery discharge.\n\nThe next day the sun rose upon an horizon covered with thick clouds, a\nheavy and an impenetrable curtain hung between earth and sky, and which\nunfortunately extended as far as the regions of the Rocky Mountains. It\nwas a fatality. A concert of complaints rose from all parts of the\nglobe. But Nature took no notice, and as men had chosen to disturb the\natmosphere with their gun, they must submit to the consequences.\n\nDuring this first day every one tried to pierce the thick veil of\nclouds, but no one was rewarded for the trouble; besides, they were all\nmistaken in supposing they could see it by looking up at the sky, for on\naccount of the diurnal movement of the globe the projectile was then, of\ncourse, shooting past the line of the antipodes.\n\nHowever that might be, when night again enveloped the earth--a dark,\nimpenetrable night--it was impossible to see the moon above the horizon;\nit might have been thought that she was hiding on purpose from the bold\nbeings who had shot at her. No observation was, therefore, possible, and\nthe despatches from Long's Peak confirmed the disastrous intelligence.\n\nHowever, if the experiment had succeeded, the travellers, who had\nstarted on the 1st of December, at 10h. 46m. 40s. p.m., were due at\ntheir destination on the 4th at midnight; so that as up to that time it\nwould, after all, have been difficult to observe a body so small, people\nwaited with all the patience they could muster.\n\nOn the 4th of December, from 8 p.m. till midnight, it would have been\npossible to follow the trace of the projectile, which would have\nappeared like a black speck on the shining disc of the moon. But the\nweather remained imperturbably cloudy, and exasperated the public, who\nswore at the moon for not showing herself. _Sic transit gloria mundi_!\n\nJ.T. Maston, in despair, set out for Long's Peak. He wished to make an\nobservation himself. He did not doubt that his friends had arrived at\nthe goal of their journey. No one had heard that the projectile had\nfallen upon any continent or island upon earth, and J.T. Maston did not\nadmit for a moment that it could have fallen into any of the oceans with\nwhich the earth is three parts covered.\n\nOn the 5th the same weather. The large telescopes of the old\nworld--those of Herschel, Rosse, and Foucault--were invariably fixed\nupon the Queen of Night, for the weather was magnificent in Europe, but\nthe relative weakness of these instruments prevented any useful\nobservation.\n\nOn the 6th the same weather reigned. Impatience devoured three parts of\nthe globe. The most insane means were proposed for dissipating the\nclouds accumulated in the air.\n\nOn the 7th the sky seemed to clear a little. Hopes revived but did not\nlast long, and in the evening thick clouds defended the starry vault\nagainst all eyes.\n\nThings now became grave. In fact, on the 11th, at 9.11 a.m., the moon\nwould enter her last quarter. After this delay she would decline every\nday, and even if the sky should clear the chances of observation would\nbe considerably lessened--in fact, the moon would then show only a\nconstantly-decreasing portion of her disc, and would end by becoming\nnew--that is to say, she would rise and set with the sun, whose rays\nwould make her quite invisible. They would, therefore, be obliged to\nwait till the 3rd of January, at 12.43 p.m., till she would be full\nagain and ready for observation.\n\nThe newspapers published these reflections with a thousand commentaries,\nand did not fail to tell the public that it must arm itself with angelic\npatience.\n\nOn the 8th no change. On the 9th the sun appeared for a moment, as if to\njeer at the Americans. It was received with hisses, and wounded,\ndoubtless, by such a reception, it was very miserly of its rays.\n\nOn the 10th no change. J.T. Maston nearly went mad, and fears were\nentertained for his brain until then so well preserved in its\ngutta-percha cranium.\n\nBut on the 11th one of those frightful tempests peculiar to tropical\nregions was let loose in the atmosphere. Terrific east winds swept away\nthe clouds which had been so long there, and in the evening the\nhalf-disc of the moon rode majestically amidst the limpid constellations\nof the sky.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nA NEW STAR.\n\n\nThat same night the news so impatiently expected burst like a\nthunderbolt over the United States of the Union, and thence darting\nacross the Atlantic it ran along all the telegraphic wires of the globe.\nThe projectile had been perceived, thanks to the gigantic reflector of\nLong's Peak.\n\nThe following is the notice drawn up by the director of the Cambridge\nObservatory. It resumes the scientific conclusion of the great\nexperiment made by the Gun Club:--\n\n\"Long's Peak, December 12th.\n\n\"To the Staff of the Cambridge Observatory.\n\n\"The projectile hurled by the Columbiad of Stony Hill was perceived by\nMessrs. Belfast and J.T. Maston on the 12th of December at 8.47 p.m.,\nthe moon having entered her last quarter.\n\n\"The projectile has not reached its goal. It has deviated to the side,\nbut near enough to be detained by lunar attraction.\n\n\"There its rectilinear movement changed to a circular one of extreme\nvelocity, and it has been drawn round the moon in an elliptical orbit,\nand has become her satellite.\n\n\"We have not yet been able to determine the elements of this new star.\nNeither its speed of translation or rotation is known. The distance\nwhich separates it from the surface of the moon may be estimated at\nabout 2,833 miles.\n\n\"Now two hypotheses may be taken into consideration as to a modification\nin this state of things:--\n\n\"Either the attraction of the moon will end by drawing it towards her,\nand the travellers will reach the goal of their journey,\n\n\"Or the projectile, maintained in an immutable orbit, will gravitate\nround the lunar disc till the end of time.\n\n\"Observation will settle this point some day, but until now the\nexperiment of the Gun Club has had no other result than that of\nproviding our solar system with a new star.\n\n\"J BELFAST.\"\n\nWhat discussions this unexpected _d\u00e9nouement_ gave rise to! What a\nsituation full of mystery the future reserved for the investigations of\nscience! Thanks to the courage and devotion of three men, this\nenterprise of sending a bullet to the moon, futile enough in appearance,\nhad just had an immense result, the consequences of which are\nincalculable. The travellers imprisoned in a new satellite, if they have\nnot attained their end, form at least part of the lunar world; they\ngravitate around the Queen of Night, and for the first time human eyes\ncan penetrate all her mysteries. The names of Nicholl, Barbicane, and\nMichel Ardan would be for ever celebrated in astronomical annals, for\nthese bold explorers, desirous of widening the circle of human\nknowledge, had audaciously rushed into space, and had risked their lives\nin the strangest experiment of modern times.\n\nThe notice from Long's Peak once made known, there spread throughout the\nuniverse a feeling of surprise and horror. Was it possible to go to the\naid of these bold inhabitants of the earth? Certainly not, for they had\nput themselves outside of the pale of humanity by crossing the limits\nimposed by the Creator on His terrestrial creatures. They could procure\nthemselves air for two months; they had provisions for one year; but\nafter? The hardest hearts palpitated at this terrible question.\n\nOne man alone would not admit that the situation was desperate. One\nalone had confidence, and it was their friend--devoted, audacious, and\nresolute as they--the brave J.T. Maston.\n\nHe resolved not to lose sight of them. His domicile was henceforth the\npost of Long's Peak--his horizon the immense reflector. As soon as the\nmoon rose above the horizon he immediately framed her in the field of\nhis telescope; he did not lose sight of her for an instant, and\nassiduously followed her across the stellar spaces; he watched with\neternal patience the passage of the projectile over her disc of silver,\nand in reality the worthy man remained in perpetual communication with\nhis three friends, whom he did not despair of seeing again one day.\n\n\"We will correspond with them,\" said he to any one who would listen, \"as\nsoon as circumstances will allow. We shall have news from them, and they\nwill have news from us. Besides, I know them--they are ingenious men.\nThose three carry with them into space all the resources of art,\nscience, and industry. With those everything can be accomplished, and\nyou will see that they will get out of the difficulty.\"\n\n(FOR SEQUEL, SEE \"AROUND THE MOON.\")\n\n[Illustration: \"They watched thus through the lateral windows.\"]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nROUND THE MOON.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nPRELIMINARY CHAPTER.\n\nCONTAINING A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE FIRST PART OF THIS WORK TO SERVE AS\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND.\n\n\nDuring the course of the year 186---- the entire world was singularly\nexcited by a scientific experiment without precedent in the annals of\nscience. The members of the Gun Club, a circle of artillerymen\nestablished at Baltimore after the American war, had the idea of putting\nthemselves in communication with the moon--yes, with the moon--by\nsending a bullet to her. Their president, Barbicane, the promoter of the\nenterprise, having consulted the astronomers of the Cambridge\nObservatory on this subject, took all the precautions necessary for the\nsuccess of the extraordinary enterprise, declared practicable by the\nmajority of competent people. After having solicited a public\nsubscription which produced nearly 30,000,000 of francs, it began its\ngigantic labours.\n\nAccording to the plan drawn up by the members of the observatory, the\ncannon destined to hurl the projectile was to be set up in some country\nsituated between the 0\u00b0 and 28\u00b0 of north or south latitude in order to\naim at the moon at the zenith. The bullet was to be endowed with an\ninitial velocity of 12,000 yards a second. Hurled on the 1st of December\nat thirteen minutes and twenty seconds to eleven in the evening, it was\nto get to the moon four days after its departure on the 5th of December\nat midnight precisely, at the very instant she would be at her\nperigee--that is to say, nearest to the earth, or at exactly 86,410\nleagues' distance.\n\nThe principal members of the Gun Club, the president, Barbicane, Major\nElphinstone, the secretary, J.T. Maston, and other _savants_, held\nseveral meetings, in which the form and composition of the bullet were\ndiscussed, as well as the disposition and nature of the cannon, and the\nquality and quantity of the powder to be employed. It was decided--1,\nthat the projectile should be an obus of aluminium, with a diameter of\n800 inches; its sides were to be 12 inches thick, and it was to weigh\n19,250 lbs.; 2, that the cannon should be a cast-iron Columbiad 900 feet\nlong, and should be cast at once in the ground; 3, that the charge\nshould consist of 400,000 lbs. of gun-cotton, which, by developing\n6,000,000,000 litres of gas under the projectile, would carry it easily\ntowards the Queen of Night.\n\nThese questions settled, President Barbicane, aided by the engineer,\nMurchison, chose a site in Florida in 27\u00b0 7' north lat. and 5\u00b0 7' west\nlong. It was there that after marvels of labour the Columbiad was cast\nquite successfully.\n\nThings were at that pass when an incident occurred which Increased the\ninterest attached to this great enterprise.\n\nA Frenchman, a regular Parisian, an artist as witty as audacious, asked\nleave to shut himself up in the bullet in order to reach the moon and\nmake a survey of the terrestrial satellite. This intrepid adventurer's\nname was Michel Ardan. He arrived in America, was received with\nenthusiasm, held meetings, was carried in triumph, reconciled President\nBarbicane to his mortal enemy, Captain Nicholl, and in pledge of the\nreconciliation he persuaded them to embark with him in the projectile.\n\nThe proposition was accepted. The form of the bullet was changed. It\nbecame cylindro-conical. They furnished this species of a\u00ebrial\ncompartment with powerful springs and breakable partitions to break the\ndeparting shock. It was filled with provisions for one year, water for\nsome months, and gas for some days. An automatic apparatus made and gave\nout the air necessary for the respiration of the three travellers. At\nthe same time the Gun Club had a gigantic telescope set up on one of the\nhighest summits of the Rocky Mountains, through which the projectile\ncould be followed during its journey through space. Everything was then\nready.\n\nOn the 30th of November, at the time fixed, amidst an extraordinary\nconcourse of spectators, the departure took place, and for the first\ntime three human beings left the terrestrial globe for the\ninterplanetary regions with almost the certainty of reaching their goal.\n\nThese audacious travellers, Michel Ardan, President Barbicane, and\nCaptain Nicholl were to accomplish their journey in ninety-seven hours\nthirteen minutes and twenty seconds; consequently they could not reach\nthe lunar disc until the 5th of December, at midnight, at the precise\nmoment that the moon would be full, and not on the 4th, as some\nwrongly-informed newspapers had given out.\n\nBut an unexpected circumstance occurred; the detonation produced by the\nColumbiad had the immediate effect of disturbing the terrestrial\natmosphere, where an enormous quantity of vapour accumulated. This\nphenomenon excited general indignation, for the moon was hidden during\nseveral nights from the eyes of her contemplators.\n\nThe worthy J.T. Maston, the greatest friend of the three travellers, set\nout for the Rocky Mountains in the company of the Honourable J. Belfast,\ndirector of the Cambridge Observatory, and reached the station of Long's\nPeak, where the telescope was set up which brought the moon, apparently,\nto within two leagues. The honourable secretary of the Gun Club wished\nto observe for himself the vehicle that contained his audacious friends.\n\nThe accumulation of clouds in the atmosphere prevented all observation\nduring the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th of December. It was even\nthought that no observation could take place before the 3rd of January\nin the following year, for the moon, entering her last quarter on the\n11th, would after that not show enough of her surface to allow the trace\nof the projectile to be followed.\n\nBut at last, to the general satisfaction, a strong tempest during the\nnight between the 11th and 12th of December cleared the atmosphere, and\nthe half-moon was distinctly visible on the dark background of the sky.\n\nThat same night a telegram was sent from Long's Peak Station by J.T.\nMaston and Belfast to the staff of the Cambridge Observatory.\n\nThis telegram announced that on the 11th of December, at 8.47 p.m., the\nprojectile hurled by the Columbiad of Stony Hill had been perceived by\nMessrs. Belfast and J.T. Maston, that the bullet had deviated from its\ncourse through some unknown cause, and had not reached its goal, but had\ngone near enough to be retained by lunar attraction; that its\nrectilinear movement had been changed to a circular one, and that it was\ndescribing an elliptical orbit round the moon, and had become her\nsatellite.\n\nThe telegram added that the elements of this new star had not yet been\ncalculated--in fact, three observations, taking a star in three\ndifferent positions, are necessary to determine them. Then it stated\nthat the distance separating the projectile from the lunar surface\n\"might be\" estimated at about 2,833 leagues, or 4,500 miles.\n\nIt ended with the following double hypothesis:--Either the attraction of\nthe moon would end by carrying the day, and the travellers would reach\ntheir goal; or the projectile, fixed in an immutable orbit, would\ngravitate around the lunar disc to the end of time.\n\nIn either of these alternatives what would be the travellers' fate? It\nis true they had provisions enough for some time. But even supposing\nthat their bold enterprise were crowned with success, how would they\nreturn? Could they ever return? Would news of them ever reach the earth?\nThese questions, debated upon by the most learned writers of the time,\nintensely interested the public.\n\nA remark may here be made which ought to be meditated upon by too\nimpatient observers. When a _savant_ announces a purely speculative\ndiscovery to the public he cannot act with too much prudence. No one is\nobliged to discover either a comet or a satellite, and those who make a\nmistake in such a case expose themselves justly to public ridicule.\nTherefore it is better to wait; and that is what impatient J.T. Maston\nought to have done before sending to the world the telegram which,\naccording to him, contained the last communication about this\nenterprise.\n\nIn fact, the telegram contained errors of two sorts, verified later:--1.\nErrors of observation concerning the distance of the projectile from the\nsurface of the moon, for upon the date of the 11th of December it was\nimpossible to perceive it, and that which J.T. Maston had seen, or\nthought he saw, could not be the bullet from the Columbiad. 2. A\ntheoretic error as to the fate of the said projectile, for making it a\nsatellite of the moon was an absolute contradiction of the laws of\nrational mechanics.\n\nOne hypothesis only made by the astronomers of Long's Peak might be\nrealised, the one that foresaw the case when the travellers--if any yet\nexisted--should unite their efforts with the lunar attraction so as to\nreach the surface of the disc.\n\nNow these men, as intelligent as they were bold, had survived the\nterrible shock at departure, and their journey in their bullet-carriage\nwill be related in its most dramatic as well as in its most singular\ndetails. This account will put an end to many illusions and previsions,\nbut it will give a just idea of the various circumstances incidental to\nsuch an enterprise, and will set in relief Barbicane's scientific\ninstincts, Nicholl's industrial resources, and the humorous audacity of\nMichel Ardan.\n\nBesides, it will prove that their worthy friend J.T. Maston was losing\nhis time when, bending over the gigantic telescope, he watched the\ncourse of the moon across the planetary regions.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nFROM 10.20 P.M. TO 10.47 P.M.\n\n\nWhen ten o'clock struck, Michel Ardan, Barbicane, and Nicholl said\ngood-bye to the numerous friends they left upon the earth. The two dogs,\ndestined to acclimatise the canine race upon the lunar continents, were\nalready imprisoned in the projectile. The three travellers approached\nthe orifice of the enormous iron tube, and a crane lowered them to the\nconical covering of the bullet.\n\nThere an opening made on purpose let them down into the aluminium\nvehicle. The crane's tackling was drawn up outside, and the mouth of the\nColumbiad instantly cleared of its last scaffolding.\n\nAs soon as Nicholl and his companions were in the projectile he closed\nthe opening by means of a strong plate screwed down inside. Other\nclosely-fitting plates covered the lenticular glasses of the skylights.\nThe travellers, hermetically inclosed in their metal prison, were in\nprofound darkness.\n\n\"And now, my dear companions,\" said Michel Ardan, \"let us make ourselves\nat home. I am a domestic man myself, and know how to make the best of\nany lodgings. First let us have a light; gas was not invented for\nmoles!\"\n\nSaying which the light-hearted fellow struck a match on the sole of his\nboot and then applied it to the burner of the receptacle, in which there\nwas enough carbonised hydrogen, stored under strong pressure, for\nlighting and heating the bullet for 144 hours, or six days and six\nnights.\n\nOnce the gas lighted, the projectile presented the aspect of a\ncomfortable room with padded walls, furnished with circular divans, the\nroof of which was in the shape of a dome.\n\nThe objects in it, weapons, instruments, and utensils, were solidly\nfastened to the sides in order to bear the parting shock with impunity.\nEvery possible precaution had been taken to insure the success of so\nbold an experiment.\n\nMichel Ardan examined everything, and declared himself quite satisfied\nwith his quarters.\n\n\"It is a prison,\" said he, \"but a travelling prison, and if I had the\nright to put my nose to the window I would take it on a hundred years'\nlease! You are smiling, Barbicane. You are thinking of something you do\nnot communicate. Do you say to yourself that this prison may be our\ncoffin? Our coffin let it be; I would not change it for Mahomet's, which\nonly hangs in space, and does not move!\"\n\nWhilst Michel Ardan was talking thus, Barbicane and Nicholl were making\ntheir last preparations.\n\nIt was 10.20 p.m. by Nicholl's chronometer when the three travellers\nwere definitely walled up in their bullet. This chronometer was\nregulated to the tenth of a second by that of the engineer, Murchison.\nBarbicane looked at it.\n\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"it is twenty minutes past ten; at thirteen\nminutes to eleven Murchison will set fire to the Columbiad; at that\nminute precisely we shall leave our spheroid. We have, therefore, still\nseven-and-twenty minutes to remain upon earth.\"\n\n\"Twenty-six minutes and thirteen seconds,\" answered the methodical\nNicholl.\n\n\"Very well!\" cried Michel Ardan good-humouredly; \"in twenty-six minutes\nlots of things can be done. We can discuss grave moral or political\nquestions, and even solve them. Twenty-six minutes well employed are\nworth more than twenty-six years of doing nothing. A few seconds of a\nPascal or a Newton are more precious than the whole existence of a crowd\nof imbeciles.\"\n\n\"And what do you conclude from that, talker eternal?\" asked President\nBarbicane.\n\n\"I conclude that we have twenty-six minutes,\" answered Ardan.\n\n\"Twenty-four only,\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"Twenty-four, then, if you like, brave captain,\" answered Ardan;\n\"twenty-four minutes, during which we might investigate--\"\n\n\"Michel,\" said Barbicane, \"during our journey we shall have plenty of\ntime to investigate the deepest questions. Now we must think of\nstarting.\"\n\n\"Are we not ready?\"\n\n\"Certainly. But there are still some precautions to be taken to deaden\nthe first shock as much as possible!\"\n\n\"Have we not water-cushions placed between movable partitions elastic\nenough to protect us sufficiently?\"\n\n\"I hope so, Michel,\" answered Barbicane gently; \"but I am not quite\nsure!\"\n\n\"Ah, the joker!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan. \"He hopes! He is not quite\nsure! And he waits till we are encased to make this deplorable\nacknowledgment! I ask to get out.\"\n\n\"By what means?\" asked Barbicane.\n\n\"Well!\" said Michel Ardan, \"it would be difficult. We are in the train,\nand the guard's whistle will be heard in twenty-four minutes.\"\n\n\"Twenty!\" ejaculated Nicholl.\n\nThe three travellers looked at one another for a few seconds. Then they\nexamined all the objects imprisoned with them.\n\n\"Everything is in its place,\" said Barbicane. \"The question now is where\nwe can place ourselves so as best to support the departing shock. The\nposition we assume must be important too--we must prevent the blood\nrushing too violently to our heads.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"Then,\" answered Michel Ardan, always ready to suit the action to the\nword, \"we will stand on our heads like the clowns at the circus.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Barbicane; \"but let us lie on our sides; we shall thus resist\nthe shock better. When the bullet starts it will not much matter whether\nwe are inside or in front.\"\n\n\"If it comes to 'not much matter' I am more reassured,\" answered Michel\nArdan.\n\n\"Do you approve of my idea, Nicholl?\" asked Barbicane.\n\n\"Entirely,\" answered the captain. \"Still thirteen minutes and a-half.\"\n\n\"Nicholl is not a man,\" exclaimed Michel; \"he is a chronometer marking\nthe seconds, and with eight holes in--\"\n\nBut his companions were no longer listening to him, and they were making\ntheir last preparations with all the coolness imaginable. They looked\nlike two methodical travellers taking their places in the train and\nmaking themselves as comfortable as possible. One wonders, indeed, of\nwhat materials these American hearts are made, to which the approach of\nthe most frightful danger does not add a single pulsation.\n\nThree beds, thick and solidly made, had been placed in the projectile.\nNicholl and Barbicane placed them in the centre of the disc that formed\nthe movable flooring. There the three travellers were to lie down a few\nminutes before their departure.\n\nIn the meanwhile Ardan, who could not remain quiet, turned round his\nnarrow prison like a wild animal in a cage, talking to his friends and\nhis dogs, Diana and Satellite, to whom it will be noticed he had some\ntime before given these significant names.\n\n\"Up, Diana! up, Satellite!\" cried he, exciting them. \"You are going to\nshow to the Selenite dogs how well-behaved the dogs of the earth can be!\nThat will do honour to the canine race. If we ever come back here I will\nbring back a cross-breed of 'moon-dogs' that will become all the rage.\"\n\n\"If there are any dogs in the moon,\" said Barbicane.\n\n\"There are some,\" affirmed Michel Ardan, \"the same as there are horses,\ncows, asses, and hens. I wager anything we shall find some hens.\"\n\n\"I bet a hundred dollars we find none,\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"Done, captain,\" answered Ardan, shaking hands with Nicholl. \"But,\nby-the-bye, you have lost three bets with the president, for the funds\nnecessary for the enterprise were provided, the casting succeeded, and\nlastly, the Columbiad was loaded without accident--that makes six\nthousand dollars.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Nicholl. \"Twenty-three minutes and six seconds to\neleven.\"\n\n\"I hear, captain. Well, before another quarter of an hour is over you\nwill have to make over another nine thousand dollars to the president,\nfour thousand because the Columbiad will not burst, and five thousand\nbecause the bullet will rise higher than six miles into the air.\"\n\n\"I have the dollars,\" answered Nicholl, striking his coat pocket, \"and I\nonly want to pay.\"\n\n\"Come, Nicholl, I see you are a man of order, what I never could be; but\nallow me to tell you that your series of bets cannot be very\nadvantageous to you.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Barbicane.\n\n\"Because if you win the first the Columbiad will have burst, and the\nbullet with it, and Barbicane will not be there to pay you your\ndollars.\"\n\n\"My wager is deposited in the Baltimore Bank,\" answered Barbicane\nsimply; \"and in default of Nicholl it will go to his heirs.\"\n\n\"What practical men you are!\" cried Michel Ardan. \"I admire you as much\nas I do not understand you.\"\n\n\"Eighteen minutes to eleven,\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"Only five minutes more,\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"Yes, five short minutes!\" replied Michel Ardan. \"And we are shut up in\na bullet at the bottom of a cannon 900 feet long! and under this bullet\nthere are 400,000 lbs. of gun-cotton, worth more than 1,600,000 lbs. of\nordinary powder! And friend Murchison, with his chronometer in hand and\nhis eye fixed on the hand and his finger on the electric knob, is\ncounting the seconds to hurl us into the planetary regions.\"\n\n\"Enough, Michel, enough!\" said Barbicane in a grave tone. \"Let us\nprepare ourselves. A few seconds only separate us from a supreme moment.\nYour hands, my friends.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried Michel Ardan, more moved than he wished to appear.\n\nThe three bold companions shook hands.\n\n\"God help us!\" said the religious president.\n\nMichel Ardan and Nicholl lay down on their beds in the centre of the\nfloor.\n\n\"Thirteen minutes to eleven,\" murmured the captain.\n\nTwenty seconds more! Barbicane rapidly put out the gas, and lay down\nbeside his companions.\n\nThe profound silence was only broken by the chronometer beating the\nseconds.\n\nSuddenly a frightful shock was felt, and the projectile, under the\nimpulsion of 6,000,000,000 litres of gas developed by the deflagration\nof the pyroxyle, rose into space.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE FIRST HALF-HOUR.\n\n\nWhat had happened? What was the effect of the frightful shock? Had the\ningenuity of the constructors of the projectile been attended by a happy\nresult? Was the effect of the shock deadened, thanks to the springs, the\nfour buffers, the water-cushions, and the movable partitions? Had they\ntriumphed over the frightful impulsion of the initial velocity of 11,000\nmetres a second? This was evidently the question the thousands of\nwitnesses of the exciting scene asked themselves. They forgot the object\nof the journey, and only thought of the travellers! Suppose one of\nthem--J.T. Maston, for instance--had been able to get a glimpse of the\ninterior of the projectile, what would he have seen?\n\nNothing then. The obscurity was profound in the bullet. Its\ncylindro-conical sides had resisted perfectly. There was not a break, a\ncrack, or a dint in them. The admirable projectile was not hurt by the\nintense deflagration of the powders, instead of being liquefied, as it\nwas feared, into a shower of aluminium.\n\nIn the interior there was very little disorder on the whole. A few\nobjects had been violently hurled up to the roof, but the most important\ndid not seem to have suffered from the shock. Their fastenings were\nintact.\n\nOn the movable disc, crushed down to the bottom by the smashing of the\npartitions and the escape of the water, three bodies lay motionless. Did\nBarbicane, Nicholl, and Michel Ardan still breathe? Was the projectile\nnothing but a metal coffin carrying three corpses into space?\n\nA few minutes after the departure of the bullet one of these bodies\nmoved, stretched out its arms, lifted up its head, and succeeded in\ngetting upon its knees. It was Michel Ardan. He felt himself, uttered a\nsonorous \"Hum,\" then said--\n\n\"Michel Ardan, complete. Now for the others!\"\n\nThe courageous Frenchman wanted to get up, but he could not stand. His\nhead vacillated; his blood, violently sent up to his head, blinded him.\nHe felt like a drunken man.\n\n\"Brrr!\" said he. \"I feel as though I had been drinking two bottles of\nCorton, only that was not so agreeable to swallow!\"\n\nThen passing his hand across his forehead several times, and rubbing his\ntemples, he called out in a firm voice--\n\n\"Nicholl! Barbicane!\"\n\nHe waited anxiously. No answer. Not even a sigh to indicate that the\nhearts of his companions still beat. He reiterated his call. Same\nsilence.\n\n\"The devil!\" said he. \"They seem as though they had fallen from the\nfifth story upon their heads! Bah!\" he added with the imperturbable\nconfidence that nothing could shake, \"if a Frenchman can get upon his\nknees, two Americans will have no difficulty in getting upon their feet.\nBut, first of all, let us have a light on the subject.\"\n\nArdan felt life come back to him in streams. His blood became calm, and\nresumed its ordinary circulation. Fresh efforts restored his\nequilibrium. He succeeded in getting up, took a match out of his pocket,\nand struck it; then putting it to the burner he lighted the gas. The\nmeter was not in the least damaged. The gas had not escaped. Besides,\nthe smell would have betrayed it, and had this been the case, Michel\nArdan could not with impunity have lighted a match in a medium filled\nwith hydrogen. The gas, mixed in the air, would have produced a\ndetonating mixture, and an explosion would have finished what a shock\nhad perhaps begun.\n\nAs soon as the gas was lighted Ardan bent down over his two companions.\nTheir bodies were thrown one upon the other, Nicholl on the top,\nBarbicane underneath.\n\nArdan raised the captain, propped him up against a divan, and rubbed him\nvigorously. This friction, administered skilfully, reanimated Nicholl,\nwho opened his eyes, instantly recovered his presence of mind, seized\nArdan's hand, and then looking round him--\n\n\"And Barbicane?\" he asked.\n\n\"Each in turn,\" answered Michel Ardan tranquilly. \"I began with you,\nNicholl, because you were on the top. Now I'll go to Barbicane.\"\n\nThat said, Ardan and Nicholl raised the president of the Gun Club and\nput him on a divan. Barbicane seemed to have suffered more than his\ncompanions. He was bleeding, but Nicholl was glad to find that the\nhemorrhage only came from a slight wound in his shoulder. It was a\nsimple scratch, which he carefully closed.\n\nNevertheless, Barbicane was some time before he came to himself, which\nfrightened his two friends, who did not spare their friction.\n\n\"He is breathing, however,\" said Nicholl, putting his ear to the breast\nof the wounded man.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Ardan, \"he is breathing like a man who is in the habit\nof doing it daily. Rub, Nicholl, rub with all your might.\"\n\nAnd the two improvised practitioners set to work with such a will and\nmanaged so well that Barbicane at last came to his senses. He opened his\neyes, sat up, took the hands of his two friends, and his first words\nwere--\n\n\"Nicholl, are we going on?\"\n\nNicholl and Ardan looked at one another. They had not yet thought about\nthe projectile. Their first anxiety had been for the travellers, not for\nthe vehicle.\n\n\"Well, really, are we going on?\" repeated Michel Ardan.\n\n\"Or are we tranquilly resting on the soil of Florida?\" asked Nicholl.\n\n\"Or at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico?\" added Michel Ardan.\n\n\"Impossible!\" cried President Barbicane.\n\nThis double hypothesis suggested by his two friends immediately recalled\nhim to life and energy.\n\nThey could not yet decide the question. The apparent immovability of the\nbullet and the want of communication with the exterior prevented them\nfinding it out. Perhaps the projectile was falling through space.\nPerhaps after rising a short distance it had fallen upon the earth, or\neven into the Gulf of Mexico, a fall which the narrowness of the\nFloridian peninsula rendered possible.\n\nThe case was grave, the problem interesting. It was necessary to solve\nit as soon as possible. Barbicane, excited, and by his moral energy\ntriumphing over his physical weakness, stood up and listened. A profound\nsilence reigned outside. But the thick padding was sufficient to shut\nout all the noises on earth; However, one circumstance struck\nBarbicane. The temperature in the interior of the projectile was\nsingularly high. The president drew out a thermometer from the envelope\nthat protected it and consulted it. The instrument showed 81\u00b0 Fahr.\n\n\"Yes!\" he then exclaimed--\"yes, we are moving! This stifling heat oozes\nthrough the sides of our projectile. It is produced by friction against\nthe atmosphere. It will soon diminish; because we are already moving in\nspace, and after being almost suffocated we shall endure intense cold.\"\n\n\"What!\" asked Michel Ardan, \"do you mean to say that we are already\nbeyond the terrestrial atmosphere?\"\n\n\"Without the slightest doubt, Michel. Listen to me. It now wants but\nfive minutes to eleven. It is already eight minutes since we started.\nNow, if our initial velocity has not been diminished by friction, six\nseconds would be enough for us to pass the sixteen leagues of atmosphere\nwhich surround our spheroid.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" answered Nicholl; \"but in what proportion do you reckon the\ndiminution of speed by friction?\"\n\n\"In the proportion of one-third,\" answered Barbicane. \"This diminution\nis considerable, but it is so much according to my calculations. If,\ntherefore, we have had an initial velocity of 11,000 metres, when we get\npast the atmosphere it will be reduced to 7,332 metres. However that may\nbe, we have already cleared that space, and--\"\n\n\"And then,\" said Michel Ardan, \"friend Nicholl has lost his two\nbets--four thousand dollars because the Columbiad has not burst, five\nthousand dollars because the projectile has risen to a greater height\nthan six miles; therefore, Nicholl, shell out.\"\n\n\"We must prove it first,\" answered the captain, \"and pay afterwards. It\nis quite possible that Barbicane's calculations are exact, and that I\nhave lost my nine thousand dollars. But another hypothesis has come into\nmy mind, and it may cancel the wager.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Barbicane quickly.\n\n\"The supposition that for some reason or other the powder did not catch\nfire, and we have not started.\"\n\n\"Good heavens! captain,\" cried Michel Ardan, \"that is a supposition\nworthy of me! It is not serious! Have we not been half stunned by the\nshock? Did I not bring you back to life? Does not the president's\nshoulder still bleed from the blow?\"\n\n\"Agreed, Michel,\" replied Nicholl, \"but allow me to ask one question.\"\n\n\"Ask it, captain.\"\n\n\"Did you hear the detonation, which must certainly have been\nformidable?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Ardan, much surprised, \"I certainly did not hear it.\"\n\n\"And you, Barbicane?\"\n\n\"I did not either.\"\n\n\"What do you make of that?\" asked Nicholl.\n\n\"What indeed!\" murmured the president; \"why did we not hear the\ndetonation?\"\n\nThe three friends looked at one another rather disconcertedly. Here was\nan inexplicable phenomenon. The projectile had been fired, however, and\nthere must have been a detonation.\n\n\"We must know first where we are,\" said Barbicane, \"so let us open the\npanel.\"\n\nThis simple operation was immediately accomplished. The screws that\nfastened the bolts on the outer plates of the right-hand skylight\nyielded to the coach-wrench. These bolts were driven outside, and\nobturators wadded with indiarubber corked up the hole that let them\nthrough. The exterior plate immediately fell back upon its hinges like a\nport-hole, and the lenticular glass that covered the hole appeared. An\nidentical light-port had been made in the other side of the projectile,\nanother in the dome, and a fourth in the bottom. The firmament could\ntherefore be observed in four opposite directions--the firmament through\nthe lateral windows, and the earth or the moon more directly through the\nupper or lower opening of the bullet.\n\nBarbicane and his companions immediately rushed to the uncovered\nport-hole. No ray of light illuminated it. Profound darkness surrounded\nthe projectile. This darkness did not prevent Barbicane exclaiming--\n\n\"No, my friends, we have not fallen on the earth again! No, we are not\nimmersed at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico! Yes, we are going up\nthrough space! Look at those stars that are shining in the darkness, and\nthe impenetrable darkness that lies between the earth and us!\"\n\n\"Hurrah! hurrah!\" cried Michel Ardan and Nicholl with one voice.\n\nIn fact, the thick darkness proved that the projectile had left the\nearth, for the ground, then brilliantly lighted by the moon, would have\nappeared before the eyes of the travellers if they had been resting upon\nit. This darkness proved also that the projectile had passed beyond the\natmosphere, for the diffused light in the air would have been reflected\non the metallic sides of the projectile, which reflection was also\nwanting. This light would have shone upon the glass of the light-port,\nand that glass was in darkness. Doubt was no longer possible. The\ntravellers had quitted the earth.\n\n\"I have lost.\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"I congratulate you upon it,\" answered Ardan.\n\n\"Here are nine thousand dollars,\" said the captain, taking a bundle of\nnotes out of his pocket.\n\n\"Will you have a receipt?\" asked Barbicane as he took the money.\n\n\"If you do not mind,\" answered Nicholl; \"it is more regular.\"\n\nAnd as seriously and phlegmatically as if he had been in his\ncounting-house, President Barbicane drew out his memorandum-book and\ntore out a clear page, wrote a receipt in pencil, dated it, signed it,\nand gave it to the captain, who put it carefully into his pocket-book.\n\nMichel Ardan took off his hat and bowed to his two companions without\nspeaking a word. Such formality under such circumstances took away his\npower of speech. He had never seen anything so American.\n\nOnce their business over, Barbicane and Nicholl went back to the\nlight-port and looked at the constellations. The stars stood out clearly\nupon the dark background of the sky. But from this side the moon could\nnot be seen, as she moves from east to west, rising gradually to the\nzenith. Her absence made Ardan say--\n\n\"And the moon? Is she going to fail us?\"\n\n\"Do not frighten yourself,\" answered Barbicane, \"Our spheroid is at her\npost, but we cannot see her from this side. We must open the opposite\nlight-port.\"\n\nAt the very moment when Barbicane was going to abandon one window to set\nclear the opposite one, his attention was attracted by the approach of a\nshining object. It was an enormous disc the colossal dimensions of which\ncould not be estimated. Its face turned towards the earth was\nbrilliantly lighted. It looked like a small moon reflecting the light of\nthe large one. It advanced at prodigious speed, and seemed to describe\nround the earth an orbit right across the passage of the projectile. To\nthe movement of translation of this object was added a movement of\nrotation upon itself. It was therefore behaving like all celestial\nbodies abandoned in space.\n\n\"Eh!\" cried Michel Ardan. \"Whatever is that? Another projectile?\"\n\nBarbicane did not answer. The apparition of this enormous body surprised\nhim and made him uneasy. A collision was possible which would have had\ndeplorable results, either by making the projectile deviate from its\nroute and fall back upon the earth, or be caught up by the attractive\npower of the asteroid.\n\nPresident Barbicane had rapidly seized the consequences of these three\nhypotheses, which in one way or other would fatally prevent the success\nof his attempt. His companions were silently watching the object, which\ngrew prodigiously larger as it approached, and through a certain optical\nillusion it seemed as if the projectile were rushing upon it.\n\n\"Ye gods!\" cried Michel Ardan; \"there will be a collision on the line!\"\n\nThe three travellers instinctively drew back. Their terror was extreme,\nbut it did not last long, hardly a few seconds. The asteroid passed at a\ndistance of a few hundred yards from the projectile and disappeared, not\nso much on account of the rapidity of its course, but because its side\nopposite to the moon was suddenly confounded with the absolute darkness\nof space.\n\n\"A good journey to you!\" cried Michel Ardan, uttering a sigh of\nsatisfaction. \"Is not infinitude large enough to allow a poor little\nbullet to go about without fear? What was that pretentious globe which\nnearly knocked against us?\"\n\n\"I know!\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"Of course! you know everything.\"\n\n\"It is a simple asteroid,\" said Barbicane; \"but so large that the\nattraction of the earth has kept it in the state of a satellite.\"\n\n\"Is it possible!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan. \"Then the earth has two moons\nlike Neptune?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend, two moons, though she is generally supposed to have but\none. But this second moon is so small and her speed so great that the\ninhabitants of the earth cannot perceive her. It was by taking into\naccount certain perturbations that a French astronomer, M. Petit, was\nable to determine the existence of this second satellite and calculate\nits elements. According to his observations, this asteroid accomplishes\nits revolution round the earth in three hours and twenty minutes only.\nThat implies prodigious speed.\"\n\n\"Do all astronomers admit the existence of this satellite?\" asked\nNicholl.\n\n\"No,\" answered Barbicane; \"but if they had met it like we have they\ncould not doubt any longer. By-the-bye, this asteroid, which would have\nmuch embarrassed us had it knocked against us, allows us to determine\nour position in space.\"\n\n\"How?\" said Ardan.\n\n\"Because its distance is known, and where we met it we were exactly at\n8,140 kilometres from the surface of the terrestrial globe.\"\n\n\"More than 2,000 leagues!\" cried Michel Ardan. \"That beats the express\ntrains of the pitiable globe called the earth!\"\n\n\"I should think it did,\" answered Nicholl, consulting his\nchronometer; \"it is eleven o'clock, only thirteen minutes since we\nleft the American continent.\"\n\n\"Only thirteen minutes?\" said Barbicane.\n\n\"That is all,\" answered Nicholl; \"and if our initial velocity were\nconstant we should make nearly 10,000 leagues an hour.\"\n\n\"That is all very well, my friends,\" said the president; \"but one\ninsoluble question still remains--why did we not hear the detonation of\nthe Columbiad?\"\n\nFor want of an answer the conversation stopped, and Barbicane, still\nreflecting, occupied himself with lowering the covering of the second\nlateral light-port. His operation succeeded, and through the glass the\nmoon filled the interior of the projectile with brilliant light.\nNicholl, like an economical man, put out the gas that was thus rendered\nuseless, and the brilliance of which obstructed the observation of\nplanetary space.\n\nThe lunar disc then shone with incomparable purity. Her rays, no longer\nfiltered by the vapoury atmosphere of the terrestrial globe, shone\nclearly through the glass and saturated the interior air of the\nprojectile with silvery reflections. The black curtain of the firmament\nreally doubled the brilliancy of the moon, which in this void of ether\nunfavourable to diffusion did not eclipse the neighbouring stars. The\nsky, thus seen, presented quite a different aspect--one that no human\neye could imagine.\n\nIt will be readily understood with what interest these audacious men\ncontemplated the moon, the supreme goal of their journey. The earth's\nsatellite, in her movement of translation, insensibly neared the zenith,\na mathematical point which she was to reach about ninety-six hours\nlater. Her mountains and plains, or any object in relief, were not seen\nmore plainly than from the earth; but her light across the void was\ndeveloped with incomparable intensity. The disc shone like a platinum\nmirror. The travellers had already forgotten all about the earth which\nwas flying beneath their feet.\n\nIt was Captain Nicholl who first drew attention to the vanished globe.\n\n\"Yes!\" answered Michel Ardan. \"We must not be ungrateful to it. As we\nare leaving our country let our last looks reach it. I want to see the\nearth before it disappears completely from our eyes!\"\n\nBarbicane, to satisfy the desires of his companion, occupied himself\nwith clearing the window at the bottom of the projectile, the one\nthrough which they could observe the earth directly. The movable floor\nwhich the force of projection had sent to the bottom was taken to\npieces, not without difficulty; its pieces, carefully placed against the\nsides, might still be of use. Then appeared a circular bay window, half\na yard wide, cut in the lower part of the bullet. It was filled with\nglass five inches thick, strengthened with brass settings. Under it was\nan aluminium plate, held down by bolts. The screws taken out and the\nbolts withdrawn, the plate fell back, and visual communication was\nestablished between interior and exterior.\n\nMichel Ardan knelt upon the glass. It was dark, and seemed opaque.\n\n\"Well,\" cried he, \"but where's the earth?\"\n\n\"There it is,\" said Barbicane.\n\n\"What!\" cried Ardan, \"that thin streak, that silvery crescent?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Michel. In four days' time, when the moon is full, at the\nvery minute we shall reach her, the earth will be new. She will only\nappear to us under the form of a slender crescent, which will soon\ndisappear, and then she will be buried for some days in impenetrable\ndarkness.\"\n\n\"That the earth!\" repeated Michel Ardan, staring at the thin slice of\nhis natal planet.\n\nThe explanation given by President Barbicane was correct. The earth,\nlooked at from the projectile, was entering her last quarter. She was in\nher octant, and her crescent was clearly outlined on the dark background\nof the sky. Her light, made bluish by the thickness of her atmosphere,\nwas less intense than that of the lunar crescent. This crescent then\nshowed itself under considerable dimensions. It looked like an enormous\narch stretched across the firmament. Some points, more vividly lighted,\nespecially in its concave part, announced the presence of high\nmountains; but they disappeared sometimes under black spots, which are\nnever seen on the surface of the lunar disc. They were rings of clouds\nplaced concentrically round the terrestrial spheroid.\n\nHowever, by dint of a natural phenomenon, identical with that produced\non the moon when she is in her octants, the contour of the terrestrial\nglobe could be traced. Its entire disc appeared slightly visible through\nan effect of pale light, less appreciable than that of the moon. The\nreason of this lessened intensity is easy to understand. When this\nreflection is produced on the moon it is caused by the solar rays which\nthe earth reflects upon her satellite. Here it was caused by the solar\nrays reflected from the moon upon the earth. Now terrestrial light is\nthirteen times more intense than lunar light on account of the\ndifference of volume in the two bodies. Hence it follows that in the\nphenomenon of the pale light the dark part of the earth's disc is less\nclearly outlined than that of the moon's disc, because the intensity of\nthe phenomenon is in proportion to the lighting power of the two stars.\nIt must be added that the terrestrial crescent seems to form a more\nelongated curve than that of the disc--a pure effect of irradiation.\n\nWhilst the travellers were trying to pierce the profound darkness of\nspace, a brilliant shower of falling stars shone before their eyes.\nHundreds of meteors, inflamed by contact with the atmosphere, streaked\nthe darkness with luminous trails, and lined the cloudy part of the disc\nwith their fire. At that epoch the earth was in her perihelion, and the\nmonth of December is so propitious to these shooting stars that\nastronomers have counted as many as 24,000 an hour. But Michel Ardan,\ndisdaining scientific reasoning, preferred to believe that the earth was\nsaluting with her finest fireworks the departure of her three children.\n\nThis was all they saw of the globe lost in the darkness, an inferior\nstar of the solar world, which for the grand planets rises or sets as a\nsimple morning or evening star! Imperceptible point in space, it was now\nonly a fugitive crescent, this globe where they had left all their\naffections.\n\nFor a long time the three friends, not speaking, yet united in heart,\nwatched while the projectile went on with uniformly decreasing velocity.\nThen irresistible sleep took possession of them. Was it fatigue of body\nand mind? Doubtless, for after the excitement of the last hours passed\nupon earth, reaction must inevitably set in.\n\n\"Well,\" said Michel, \"as we must sleep, let us go to sleep.\"\n\nStretched upon their beds, all three were soon buried in profound\nslumber.\n\nBut they had not been unconscious for more than a quarter of an hour\nwhen Barbicane suddenly rose, and, waking his companions, in a loud\nvoice cried--\n\n\"I've found it!\"\n\n\"What have you found?\" asked Michel Ardan, jumping out of bed.\n\n\"The reason we did not hear the detonation of the Columbiad!\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"It was because our projectile went quicker than sound.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTAKING POSSESSION.\n\n\nThis curious but certainly correct explanation once given, the three\nfriends fell again into a profound sleep. Where would they have found a\ncalmer or more peaceful place to sleep in? Upon earth, houses in the\ntown or cottages in the country feel every shock upon the surface of the\nglobe. At sea, ships, rocked by the waves, are in perpetual movement. In\nthe air, balloons incessantly oscillate upon the fluid strata of\ndifferent densities. This projectile alone, travelling in absolute void\namidst absolute silence, offered absolute repose to its inhabitants.\n\nThe sleep of the three adventurers would have, perhaps, been\nindefinitely prolonged if an unexpected noise had not awakened them\nabout 7 a.m. on the 2nd of December, eight hours after their departure.\n\nThis noise was a very distinct bark.\n\n\"The dogs! It is the dogs!\" cried Michel Ardan, getting up immediately.\n\n\"They are hungry,\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"I should think so,\" answered Michel; \"we have forgotten them.\"\n\n\"Where are they?\" asked Barbicane.\n\nOne of the animals was found cowering under the divan. Terrified and\nstunned by the first shock, it had remained in a corner until the moment\nit had recovered its voice along with the feeling of hunger.\n\nIt was Diana, still rather sheepish, that came from the retreat, not\nwithout urging. Michel Ardan encouraged her with his most gracious\nwords.\n\n\"Come, Diana,\" he said--\"come, my child; your destiny will be noted in\ncynegetic annals! Pagans would have made you companion to the god\nAnubis, and Christians friend to St. Roch! You are worthy of being\ncarved in bronze for the king of hell, like the puppy that Jupiter gave\nbeautiful Europa as the price of a kiss! Your celebrity will efface that\nof the Montargis and St. Bernard heroes. You are rushing through\ninterplanetary space, and will, perhaps, be the Eve of Selenite dogs!\nYou will justify up there Toussenel's saying, 'In the beginning God\ncreated man, and seeing how weak he was, gave him the dog!' Come, Diana,\ncome here!\"\n\nDiana, whether flattered or not, came out slowly, uttering plaintive\nmoans.\n\n\"Good!\" said Barbicane. \"I see Eve, but where is Adam?\"\n\n\"Adam,\" answered Michel Ardan, \"can't be far off. He is here somewhere.\nHe must be called! Satellite! here, Satellite!\"\n\nBut Satellite did not appear. Diana continued moaning. It was decided,\nhowever, that she was not wounded, and an appetising dish was set before\nher to stop her complaining.\n\nAs to Satellite, he seemed lost. They were obliged to search a long time\nbefore discovering him in one of the upper compartments of the\nprojectile, where a rather inexplicable rebound had hurled him\nviolently. The poor animal was in a pitiable condition.\n\n\"The devil!\" said Michel. \"Our acclimatisation is in danger!\"\n\nThe unfortunate dog was carefully lowered. His head had been fractured\nagainst the roof, and it seemed difficult for him to survive such a\nshock. Nevertheless, he was comfortably stretched on a cushion, where he\nsighed once.\n\n\"We will take care of you,\" said Michel; \"we are responsible for your\nexistence. I would rather lose an arm than a paw of my poor Satellite.\"\n\nSo saying he offered some water to the wounded animal, who drank it\ngreedily.\n\nThese attentions bestowed, the travellers attentively watched the earth\nand the moon. The earth only appeared like a pale disc terminated by a\ncrescent smaller than that of the previous evening, but its volume\ncompared with that of the moon, which was gradually forming a perfect\ncircle, remained enormous.\n\n\"_Parbleu_!\" then said Michel Ardan; \"I am really sorry we did not start\nwhen the earth was at her full--that is to say, when our globe was in\nopposition to the sun!\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Nicholl.\n\n\"Because we should have seen our continents and seas under a new\naspect--the continents shining under the solar rays, the seas darker,\nlike they figure upon certain maps of the world! I should like to have\nseen those poles of the earth upon which the eye of man has never yet\nrested!\"\n\n\"I daresay,\" answered Barbicane, \"but if the earth had been full the\nmoon would have been new--that is to say, invisible amidst the\nirradiation of the sun. It is better for us to see the goal we want to\nreach than the place we started from.\"\n\n\"You are right, Barbicane,\" answered Captain Nicholl; \"and besides, when\nwe have reached the moon we shall have plenty of time during the long\nlunar nights to consider at leisure the globe that harbours men like\nus.\"\n\n\"Men like us!\" cried Michel Ardan. \"But now they are not more like us\nthan the Selenites. We are inhabitants of a new world peopled by us\nalone--the projectile! I am a man like Barbicane, and Barbicane is a man\nlike Nicholl. Beyond us and outside of us humanity ends, and we are the\nonly population of this microcosm until the moment we become simple\nSelenites.\"\n\n\"In about eighty-eight hours,\" replied the captain.\n\n\"Which means?\" asked Michel Ardan.\n\n\"That it is half-past eight,\" answered Nicholl.\n\n\"Very well,\" answered Michel, \"I fail to find the shadow of a reason why\nwe should not breakfast _illico_.\"\n\nIn fact, the inhabitants of the new star could not live in it without\neating, and their stomachs then submitted to the imperious laws of\nhunger. Michel Ardan, in his quality of Frenchman, declared himself\nchief cook, an important function that no one disputed with him. The gas\ngave the necessary degrees of heat for cooking purposes, and the\nprovision-locker furnished the elements of this first banquet.\n\nThe breakfast began with three cups of excellent broth, due to the\nliquefaction in hot water of three precious Liebig tablets, prepared\nfrom the choicest morsels of the Pampas ruminants. Some slices of\nbeefsteak succeeded them, compressed by the hydraulic press, as tender\nand succulent as if they had just come from the butchers of the Paris\nCaf\u00e9 Anglais. Michel, an imaginative man, would have it they were even\nrosy.\n\nPreserved vegetables, \"fresher than the natural ones,\" as the amiable\nMichel observed, succeeded the meat, and were followed by some cups of\ntea and slices of bread and butter, American fashion. This beverage,\npronounced excellent, was made from tea of the first quality, of which\nthe Emperor of Russia had put some cases at the disposition of the\ntravellers.\n\nLastly, as a worthy ending to the meal, Ardan ferreted out a fine bottle\nof \"Nuits\" burgundy that \"happened\" to be in the provision compartment.\nThe three friends drank it to the union of the earth and her satellite.\n\nAnd as if the generous wine it had distilled upon the hill-sides of\nBurgundy were not enough, the sun was determined to help in the feast.\nThe projectile at that moment emerged from the cone of shadow cast by\nthe terrestrial globe, and the sun's rays fell directly upon the lower\ndisc of the bullet, on account of the angle which the orbit of the moon\nmakes with that of the earth.\n\n\"The sun!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan.\n\n\"Of course,\" answered Barbicane; \"I expected it.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Michel, \"the cone of shadow thrown by the earth into space\nextends beyond the moon.\"\n\n\"Much beyond if you do not take the atmospheric refraction into\naccount,\" said Barbicane. \"But when the moon is enveloped in that shadow\nthe centres of the three heavenly bodies--the sun, the earth, and the\nmoon--are in a straight line. Then the nodes coincide with the full moon\nand there is an eclipse. If, therefore, we had started during an eclipse\nof the moon all our journey would have been accomplished in the dark,\nwhich would have been a pity.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because, although we are journeying in the void, our projectile, bathed\nin the solar rays, will gather their light and heat; therefore there\nwill be economy of gas, a precious economy in every way.\"\n\nIn fact, under these rays, the temperature and brilliancy of which there\nwas no atmosphere to soften, the projectile was lighted and warmed as if\nit had suddenly passed from winter to summer. The moon above and the sun\nbelow inundated it with their rays.\n\n\"It is pleasant here now,\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"I believe you!\" cried Michel Ardan. \"With a little vegetable soil\nspread over our aluminium planet we could grow green peas in twenty-four\nhours. I have only one fear, that is that the walls of our bullet will\nmelt.\"\n\n\"You need not alarm yourself, my worthy friend,\" answered Barbicane.\n\"The projectile supported a much higher temperature while it was\ntravelling through the atmosphere. I should not even wonder if it looked\nto the eyes of the spectators like a fiery meteor.\"\n\n\"Then J.T. Maston must think we are roasted!\"\n\n\"What I am astonished at,\" answered Barbicane, \"is that we are not. It\nwas a danger we did not foresee.\"\n\n\"I feared it,\" answered Nicholl simply.\n\n\"And you did not say anything about it, sublime captain!\" cried Michel\nArdan, shaking his companion's hand.\n\nIn the meantime Barbicane was making his arrangements in the projectile\nas though he was never going to leave it. It will be remembered that the\nbase of the a\u00ebrial vehicle was fifty-four feet square. It was twelve\nfeet high, and admirably fitted up in the interior. It was not much\nencumbered by the instruments and travelling utensils, which were all in\nspecial places, and it left some liberty of movement to its three\ninhabitants. The thick glass let into a part of the floor could bear\nconsiderable weight with impunity. Barbicane and his companions walked\nupon it as well as upon a solid floor; but the sun, which struck it\ndirectly with its rays, lighting the interior of the projectile from\nbelow, produced singular effects of light.\n\nThey began by examining the state of the water and provision\nreceptacles. They were not in the least damaged, thanks to the\nprecautions taken to deaden the shock. The provisions were abundant, and\nsufficient for one year's food. Barbicane took this precaution in case\nthe projectile should arrive upon an absolutely barren part of the moon.\nThere was only enough water and brandy for two months. But according to\nthe latest observations of astronomers, the moon had a dense low and\nthick atmosphere, at least in its deepest valleys, and there streams and\nwatercourses could not fail. Therefore the adventurous explorers would\nnot suffer from hunger or thirst during the journey, and the first year\nof their installation upon the lunar continent.\n\nThe question of air in the interior of the projectile also offered all\nsecurity. The Reiset and Regnault apparatus, destined to produce oxygen,\nwas furnished with enough chlorate of potash for two months. It\nnecessarily consumed a large quantity of gas, for it was obliged to keep\nthe productive matter up to 100\u00b0. But there was abundance of that also.\nThe apparatus wanted little looking after. It worked automatically. At\nthat high temperature the chlorate of potash changed into chlorine of\npotassium, and gave out all the oxygen it contained. The eighteen pounds\nof chlorate of potash gave out the seven pounds of oxygen necessary for\nthe daily consumption of the three travellers.\n\nBut it was not enough to renew the oxygen consumed; the carbonic acid\ngas produced by expiration must also be absorbed. Now for the last\ntwelve hours the atmosphere of the bullet had become loaded with this\ndeleterious gas, the product of the combustion of the elements of blood\nby the oxygen taken into the lungs. Nicholl perceived this state of the\nair by seeing Diana palpitate painfully. In fact, carbonic acid\ngas--through a phenomenon identical with the one to be noticed in the\nfamous Dog's Grotto--accumulated at the bottom of the projectile by\nreason of its weight. Poor Diana, whose head was low down, therefore\nnecessarily suffered from it before her masters. But Captain Nicholl\nmade haste to remedy this state of things. He placed on the floor of the\nprojectile several receptacles containing caustic potash which he shook\nabout for some time, and this matter, which is very greedy of carbonic\nacid, completely absorbed it, and thus purified the interior air.\n\nAn inventory of the instruments was then begun. The thermometers and\nbarometers were undamaged, with the exception of a minimum thermometer\nthe glass of which was broken. An excellent aneroid was taken out of\nits padded box and hung upon the wall. Of course it was only acted upon\nby and indicated the pressure of the air inside the projectile; but it\nalso indicated the quantity of moisture it contained. At that moment its\nneedle oscillated between 25.24 and 25.08. It was at \"set fair.\"\n\nBarbicane had brought several compasses, which were found intact. It\nwill be easily understood that under those circumstances their needles\nwere acting at random, without any constant direction. In fact, at the\ndistance the projectile was from the earth the magnetic pole could not\nexercise any sensible action upon the apparatus. But these compasses,\ntaken upon the lunar disc, might show particular phenomena. In any case\nit would be interesting to verify whether the earth's satellite, like\nthe earth herself, submitted to magnetical influence.\n\nA hypsometer to measure the altitude of the lunar mountains, a sextant\nto take the height of the sun, a theodolite, an instrument for\nsurveying, telescopes to be used as the moon approached--all these\ninstruments were carefully inspected and found in good condition,\nnotwithstanding the violence of the initial shock.\n\nAs to the utensils--pickaxes, spades, and different tools--of which\nNicholl had made a special collection, the sacks of various kinds of\ngrain, and the shrubs which Michel Ardan counted upon transplanting into\nSelenite soil, they were in their places in the upper corners of the\nprojectile. There was made a sort of granary, which the prodigal\nFrenchman had filled. What was in it was very little known, and the\nmerry fellow did not enlighten anybody. From time to time he climbed up\nthe cramp-irons riveted in the walls to this store-room, the inspection\nof which he had reserved to himself. He arranged and re-arranged,\nplunged his hand rapidly into certain mysterious boxes, singing all the\ntime in a voice very out of tune some old French song to enliven the\nsituation.\n\nBarbicane noticed with interest that his rockets and other fireworks\nwere not damaged. These were important, for, powerfully loaded, they\nwere meant to slacken the speed with which the projectile would, when\nattracted by the moon after passing the point of neutral attraction,\nfall upon her surface. This fall besides would be six times less rapid\nthan it would have been upon the surface of the earth, thanks to the\ndifference of volume in the two bodies.\n\nThe inspection ended, therefore, in general satisfaction. Then they all\nreturned to their posts of observation at the lateral and lower\nport-lights.\n\nThe same spectacle was spread before them. All the extent of the\ncelestial sphere swarmed with stars and constellations of marvellous\nbrilliancy, enough to make an astronomer wild! On one side the sun, like\nthe mouth of a fiery furnace, shone upon the dark background of the\nheavens. On the other side the moon, reflecting back his fires, seemed\nmotionless amidst the starry world. Then a large spot, like a hole in\nthe firmament, bordered still by a slight thread of silver--it was the\nearth. Here and there nebulous masses like large snow-flakes, and from\nzenith to nadir an immense ring, formed of an impalpable dust of\nstars--that milky way amidst which the sun only counts as a star of the\nfourth magnitude!\n\nThe spectators could not take their eyes off a spectacle so new, of\nwhich no description could give any idea. What reflections it suggested!\nWhat unknown emotions it aroused in the soul! Barbicane wished to begin\nthe recital of his journey under the empire of these impressions, and he\nnoted down hourly all the events that signalised the beginning of his\nenterprise. He wrote tranquilly in his large and rather\ncommercial-looking handwriting.\n\nDuring that time the calculating Nicholl looked over the formulae of\ntrajectories, and worked away at figures with unparalleled dexterity.\nMichel Ardan talked sometimes to Barbicane, who did not answer much, to\nNicholl, who did not hear, and to Diana, who did not understand his\ntheories, and lastly to himself, making questions and answers, going and\ncoming, occupying himself with a thousand details, sometimes leaning\nover the lower port-light, sometimes roosting in the heights of the\nprojectile, singing all the time. In this microcosm he represented the\nFrench agitation and loquacity, and it was worthily represented.\n\nThe day, or rather--for the expression is not correct--the lapse of\ntwelve hours which makes a day upon earth--was ended by a copious supper\ncarefully prepared. No incident of a nature to shake the confidence of\nthe travellers had happened, so, full of hope and already sure of\nsuccess, they went to sleep peacefully, whilst the projectile, at a\nuniformly increasing speed, made its way in the heavens.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nA LITTLE ALGEBRA.\n\n\nThe night passed without incident. Correctly speaking, the word \"night\"\nis an improper one. The position of the projectile in regard to the sun\ndid not change. Astronomically it was day on the bottom of the bullet,\nand night on the top. When, therefore, in this recital these two words\nare used they express the lapse of time between the rising and setting\nof the sun upon earth.\n\nThe travellers' sleep was so much the more peaceful because,\nnotwithstanding its excessive speed, the projectile seemed absolutely\nmotionless. No movement indicated its journey through space. However\nrapidly change of place may be effected, it cannot produce any sensible\neffect upon the organism when it takes place in the void, or when the\nmass of air circulates along with the travelling body. What inhabitant\nof the earth perceives the speed which carries him along at the rate of\n68,000 miles an hour? Movement under such circumstances is not felt more\nthan repose. Every object is indifferent to it. When a body is in repose\nit remains so until some foreign force puts it in movement. When in\nmovement it would never stop if some obstacle were not in its road. This\nindifference to movement or repose is inertia.\n\nBarbicane and his companions could, therefore, imagine themselves\nabsolutely motionless, shut up in the interior of the projectile. The\neffect would have been the same if they had placed themselves on the\noutside. Without the moon, which grew larger above them, and the earth\nthat grew smaller below, they would have sworn they were suspended in a\ncomplete stagnation.\n\nThat morning, the 3rd of December, they were awakened by a joyful but\nunexpected noise. It was the crowing of a cock in the interior of their\nvehicle.\n\nMichel Ardan was the first to get up; he climbed to the top of the\nprojectile and closed a partly-open case.\n\n\"Be quiet,\" said he in a whisper. \"That animal will spoil my plan!\"\n\nIn the meantime Nicholl and Barbicane awoke.\n\n\"Was that a cock?\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"No, my friends,\" answered Michel quickly. \"I wished to awake you with\nthat rural sound.\"\n\nSo saying he gave vent to a cock-a-doodle-do which would have done\nhonour to the proudest of gallinaceans.\n\nThe two Americans could not help laughing.\n\n\"A fine accomplishment that,\" said Nicholl, looking suspiciously at his\ncompanion.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Michel, \"a joke common in my country. It is very Gallic.\nWe perpetrate it in the best society.\"\n\nThen turning the conversation--\n\n\"Barbicane, do you know what I have been thinking about all night?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered the president.\n\n\"About our friends at Cambridge. You have already remarked how\nadmirably ignorant I am of mathematics. I find it, therefore, impossible\nto guess how our _savants_ of the observatory could calculate what\ninitial velocity the projectile ought to be endowed with on leaving the\nColumbiad in order to reach the moon.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" replied Barbicane, \"in order to reach that neutral point\nwhere the terrestrial and lunar attractions are equal; for beyond this\npoint, situated at about 0.9 of the distance, the projectile will fall\nupon the moon by virtue of its own weight merely.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" answered Michel; \"but once more; how did they calculate the\ninitial velocity?\"\n\n\"Nothing is easier,\" said Barbicane.\n\n\"And could you have made the calculation yourself?\" asked Michel Ardan.\n\n\"Certainly; Nicholl and I could have determined it if the notice from\nthe observatory had not saved us the trouble.\"\n\n\"Well, old fellow,\" answered Michel, \"they might sooner cut off my head,\nbeginning with my feet, than have made me solve that problem!\"\n\n\"Because you do not know algebra,\" replied Barbicane tranquilly.\n\n\"Ah, that's just like you dealers in _x_! You think you have explained\neverything when you have said 'algebra.'\"\n\n\"Michel,\" replied Barbicane, \"do you think it possible to forge without\na hammer, or to plough without a ploughshare?\"\n\n\"It would be difficult.\"\n\n\"Well, then, algebra is a tool like a plough or a hammer, and a good\ntool for any one who knows how to use it.\"\n\n\"Seriously?\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"Could you use that tool before me?\"\n\n\"If it would interest you.\"\n\n\"And could you show me how they calculated the initial speed of our\nvehicle?\"\n\n\"Yes, my worthy friend. By taking into account all the elements of the\nproblem, the distance from the centre of the earth to the centre of the\nmoon, of the radius of the earth, the volume of the earth and the volume\nof the moon, I can determine exactly what the initial speed of the\nprojectile ought to be, and that by a very simple formula.\"\n\n\"Show me the formula.\"\n\n\"You shall see it. Only I will not give you the curve really traced by\nthe bullet between the earth and the moon, by taking into account their\nmovement of translation round the sun. No. I will consider both bodies\nto be motionless, and that will be sufficient for us.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because that would be seeking to solve the problem called 'the problem\nof the three bodies,' for which the integral calculus is not yet far\nenough advanced.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Michel Ardan in a bantering tone; \"then mathematics have\nnot said their last word.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"Good! Perhaps the Selenites have pushed the integral calculus further\nthan you! By-the-bye, what is the integral calculus?\"\n\n\"It is the inverse of the differential calculus,\" answered Barbicane\nseriously.\n\n\"Much obliged.\"\n\n\"To speak otherwise, it is a calculus by which you seek finished\nquantities of what you know the differential quantities.\"\n\n\"That is clear at least,\" answered Barbicane with a quite satisfied air.\n\n\"And now,\" continued Barbicane, \"for a piece of paper and a pencil, and\nin half-an-hour I will have found the required formula.\"\n\nThat said, Barbicane became absorbed in his work, whilst Nicholl looked\ninto space, leaving the care of preparing breakfast to his companion.\n\nHalf-an-hour had not elapsed before Barbicane, raising his head, showed\nMichel Ardan a page covered with algebraical signs, amidst which the\nfollowing general formula was discernible:--\n\n    1   2   2          r         m'    r     r\n    - (v - v ) = gr { --- - 1 + --- ( --- - ---) }\n    2       0          x         m    d-x   d-r\n\n\"And what does that mean?\" asked Michel.\n\n\"That means,\" answered Nicholl, \"that the half of _v_ minus _v_ zero\nsquare equals _gr_ multiplied by _r_ upon _x_ minus 1 plus _m_ prime\nupon _m_ multiplied by _r_ upon _d_ minus _x_, minus _r_ upon _d_ minus\n_x_ minus _r_--\"\n\n\"_X_ upon _y_ galloping upon _z_ and rearing upon _p_\" cried Michel\nArdan, bursting out laughing. \"Do you mean to say you understand that,\ncaptain?\"\n\n\"Nothing is clearer.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Michel Ardan, \"it is as plain as a pikestaff, and I want\nnothing more.\"\n\n\"Everlasting laugher,\" said Barbicane, \"you wanted algebra, and now you\nshall have it over head and ears.\"\n\n\"I would rather be hung!\"\n\n\"That appears a good solution, Barbicane,\" said Nicholl, who was\nexamining the formula like a _connaisseur_. \"It is the integral of the\nequation of 'vis viva,' and I do not doubt that it will give us the\ndesired result.\"\n\n\"But I should like to understand!\" exclaimed Michel. \"I would give ten\nyears of Nicholl's life to understand!\"\n\n\"Then listen,\" resumed Barbicane. \"The half of _v_ minus _v_ zero square\nis the formula that gives us the demi-variation of the 'vis viva.'\"\n\n\"Good; and does Nicholl understand what that means?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Michel,\" answered the captain. \"All those signs that look so\ncabalistic to you form the clearest and most logical language for those\nwho know how to read it.\"\n\n\"And do you pretend, Nicholl,\" asked Michel, \"that by means of these\nhieroglyphics, more incomprehensible than the Egyptian ibis, you can\nfind the initial speed necessary to give to the projectile?\"\n\n\"Incontestably,\" answered Nicholl; \"and even by that formula I could\nalways tell you what speed it is going at on any point of the journey.\"\n\n\"Upon your word of honour?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you are as clever as our president.\"\n\n\"No, Michel, all the difficulty consists in what Barbicane has done. It\nis to establish an equation which takes into account all the conditions\nof the problem. The rest is only a question of arithmetic, and requires\nnothing but a knowledge of the four rules.\"\n\n\"That's something,\" answered Michel Ardan, who had never been able to\nmake a correct addition in his life, and who thus defined the rule: \"A\nChinese puzzle, by which you can obtain infinitely various results.\"\n\nStill Barbicane answered that Nicholl would certainly have found the\nformula had he thought about it.\n\n\"I do not know if I should,\" said Nicholl, \"for the more I study it the\nmore marvellously correct I find it.\"\n\n\"Now listen,\" said Barbicane to his ignorant comrade, \"and you will see\nthat all these letters have a signification.\"\n\n\"I am listening,\" said Michel, looking resigned.\n\n\"_d_,\" said Barbicane, \"is the distance from the centre of the earth to\nthe centre of the moon, for we must take the centres to calculate the\nattraction.\"\n\n\"That I understand.\"\n\n\"_r_ is the radius of the earth.\"\n\n\"_r_, radius; admitted.\"\n\n\"_m_ is the volume of the earth; _m prime_ that of the moon. We are\nobliged to take into account the volume of the two attracting bodies, as\nthe attraction is in proportion to the volume.\"\n\n\"I understand that.\"\n\n\"_g_ represents gravity, the speed acquired at the end of a second by a\nbody falling on the surface of the earth. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"A mountain stream!\" answered Michel.\n\n\"Now I represent by _x_ the variable distance that separates the\nprojectile from the centre of the earth, and by _v_ the velocity the\nprojectile has at that distance.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"Lastly, the expression _v_ zero which figures in the equation is the\nspeed the bullet possesses when it emerges from the atmosphere.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Nicholl, \"you were obliged to calculate the velocity from\nthat point, because we knew before that the velocity at departure is\nexactly equal to 3/2 of the velocity upon emerging from the atmosphere.\"\n\n\"Don't understand any more!\" said Michel.\n\n\"Yet it is very simple,\" said Barbicane.\n\n\"I do not find it very simple,\" replied Michel.\n\n\"It means that when our projectile reached the limit of the terrestrial\natmosphere it had already lost one-third of its initial velocity.\"\n\n\"As much as that?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend, simply by friction against the atmosphere. You will\neasily understand that the greater its speed the more resistance it\nwould meet with from the air.\"\n\n\"That I admit,\" answered Michel, \"and I understand it, although your _v_\nzero two and your _v_ zero square shake about in my head like nails in a\nsack.\"\n\n\"First effect of algebra,\" continued Barbicane. \"And now to finish we\nare going to find the numerical known quantity of these different\nexpressions--that is to say, find out their value.\"\n\n\"You will finish me first!\" answered Michel.\n\n\"Some of these expressions,\" said Barbicane, \"are known; the others have\nto be calculated.\"\n\n\"I will calculate those,\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"And _r_,\" resumed Barbicane, \"_r_ is the radius of the earth under the\nlatitude of Florida, our point of departure, _d_--that is to say, the\ndistance from the centre of the earth to the centre of the moon equals\nfifty-six terrestrial radii--\"\n\nNicholl rapidly calculated.\n\n\"That makes 356,720,000 metres when the moon is at her perigee--that is\nto say, when she is nearest to the earth.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Barbicane, \"now _m_ prime upon _m_--that is to say,\nthe proportion of the moon's volume to that of the earth equals 1/81.\"\n\n\"Perfect,\" said Michel.\n\n\"And _g_, the gravity, is to Florida 9-1/81 metres. From whence it\nresults that _gr_ equals--\"\n\n\"Sixty-two million four hundred and twenty-six thousand square metres,\"\nanswered Nicholl.\n\n\"What next?\" asked Michel Ardan.\n\n\"Now that the expressions are reduced to figures, I am going to find the\nvelocity _v zero_--that is to say, the velocity that the projectile\nought to have on leaving the atmosphere to reach the point of equal\nattraction with no velocity. The velocity at that point I make equal\n_zero_, and _x_, the distance where the neutral point is, will be\nrepresented by the nine-tenths of _d_--that is to say, the distance that\nseparates the two centres.\"\n\n\"I have some vague idea that it ought to be so,\" said Michel.\n\n\"I shall then have, _x_ equals nine-tenths of _d_, and _v_ equals\n_zero_, and my formula will become--\"\n\nBarbicane wrote rapidly on the paper--\n\n     2              10r   1    10r    r\n    v  = 2 gr { 1 - ---  --- ( --- - ---) }\n     0               9d   81    d    d-r\n\nNicholl read it quickly.\n\n\"That's it! that is it!\" he cried.\n\n\"Is it clear?\" asked Barbicane.\n\n\"It is written in letters of fire!\" answered Nicholl.\n\n\"Clever fellows!\" murmured Michel.\n\n\"Do you understand now?\" asked Barbicane.\n\n\"If I understand!\" cried Michel Ardan. \"My head is bursting with it.\"\n\n\"Thus,\" resumed Barbicane, \"_v zero_ square equals 2 _gr_ multiplied by\n1 minus 10 _r_ upon 9 _d_ minus 1/81 multiplied by 10 _r_ upon _d_ minus\n_r_ upon _d_ minus _r_.\"\n\n\"And now,\" said Nicholl, \"in order to obtain the velocity of the bullet\nas it emerges from the atmosphere I have only to calculate.\"\n\nThe captain, like a man used to overcome all difficulties, began to\ncalculate with frightful rapidity. Divisions and multiplications grew\nunder his fingers. Figures dotted the page. Barbicane followed him with\nhis eyes, whilst Michel Ardan compressed a coming headache with his two\nhands.\n\n\"Well, what do you make it?\" asked Barbicane after several minutes'\nsilence.\n\n\"I make it 11,051 metres in the first second.\"\n\n\"What do you say?\" said Barbicane, starting.\n\n\"Eleven thousand and fifty-one metres.\"\n\n\"Malediction!\" cried the president with a gesture of despair.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" asked Michel Ardan, much surprised.\n\n\"The matter! why if at this moment the velocity was already diminished\none-third by friction, the initial speed ought to have been--\"\n\n\"Sixteen thousand five hundred and seventy-six metres!\" answered\nNicholl.\n\n\"But the Cambridge Observatory declared that 11,000 metres were enough\nat departure, and our bullet started with that velocity only!\"\n\n\"Well?\" asked Nicholl.\n\n\"Why it was not enough!\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"We shall not reach the neutral point.\"\n\n\"The devil!\"\n\n\"We shall not even go half way!\"\n\n\"_Nom d'un boulet_!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, jumping up as if the\nprojectile were on the point of striking against the terrestrial globe.\n\n\"And we shall fall back upon the earth!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nTHE TEMPERATURE OF SPACE.\n\n\nThis revelation acted like a thunderbolt. Who could have expected such\nan error in calculation? Barbicane would not believe it. Nicholl went\nover the figures again. They were correct. The formula which had\nestablished them could not be mistrusted, and, when verified, the\ninitial velocity of 16,576 metres, necessary for attaining the neutral\npoint, was found quite right.\n\nThe three friends looked at one another in silence. No one thought about\nbreakfast after that. Barbicane, with set teeth, contracted brow, and\nfists convulsively closed, looked through the port-light. Nicholl\nfolded his arms and examined his calculations. Michel Ardan murmured--\n\n\"That's just like _savants_! That's the way they always do! I would give\ntwenty pistoles to fall upon the Cambridge Observatory and crush it,\nwith all its stupid staff inside!\"\n\nAll at once the captain made a reflection which struck Barbicane at\nonce.\n\n\"Why,\" said he, \"it is seven o'clock in the morning, so we have been\nthirty-two hours on the road. We have come more than half way, and we\nare not falling yet that I know of!\"\n\nBarbicane did not answer, but after a rapid glance at the captain he\ntook a compass, which he used to measure the angular distance of the\nterrestrial globe. Then through the lower port-light he made a very\nexact observation from the apparent immobility of the projectile. Then\nrising and wiping the perspiration from his brow, he put down some\nfigures upon paper. Nicholl saw that the president wished to find out\nfrom the length of the terrestrial diameter the distance of the bullet\nfrom the earth. He looked at him anxiously.\n\n\"No!\" cried Barbicane in a few minutes' time, \"we are not falling! We\nare already more than 50,000 leagues from the earth! We have passed the\npoint the projectile ought to have stopped at if its speed had been only\n11,000 metres at our departure! We are still ascending!\"\n\n\"That is evident,\" answered Nicholl; \"so we must conclude that our\ninitial velocity, under the propulsion of the 400,000 lbs. of\ngun-cotton, was greater than the 11,000 metres. I can now explain to\nmyself why we met with the second satellite, that gravitates at more\nthan 2,000 leagues from the earth, in less than thirteen minutes.\"\n\n\"That explanation is so much the more probable,\" added Barbicane,\n\"because by throwing out the water in our movable partitions the\nprojectile was made considerably lighter all at once.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"Ah, my brave Nicholl,\" cried Barbicane, \"we are saved!\"\n\n\"Very well then,\" answered Michel Ardan tranquilly, \"as we are saved,\nlet us have breakfast.\"\n\nNicholl was not mistaken. The initial speed had happily been greater\nthan that indicated by the Cambridge Observatory, but the Cambridge\nObservatory had no less been mistaken.\n\nThe travellers, recovered from their false alarm, sat down to table and\nbreakfasted merrily. Though they ate much they talked more. Their\nconfidence was greater after the \"algebra incident.\"\n\n\"Why should we not succeed?\" repeated Michel Ardan. \"Why should we not\narrive? We are on the road; there are no obstacles before us, and no\nstones on our route. It is free--freer than that of a ship that has to\nstruggle with the sea, or a balloon with the wind against it! Now if a\nship can go where it pleases, or a balloon ascend where it pleases, why\nshould not our projectile reach the goal it was aimed at?\"\n\n\"It will reach it,\" said Barbicane.\n\n\"If only to honour the American nation,\" added Michel Ardan, \"the only\nnation capable of making such an enterprise succeed--the only one that\ncould have produced a President Barbicane! Ah! now I think of it, now\nthat all our anxieties are over, what will become of us? We shall be as\ndull as stagnant water.\"\n\nBarbicane and Nicholl made gestures of repudiation.\n\n\"But I foresaw this, my friends,\" resumed Michel Ardan. \"You have only\nto say the word. I have chess, backgammon, cards, and dominoes at your\ndisposition. We only want a billiard-table!\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Barbicane, \"did you bring such trifles as those?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered Michel; \"not only for our amusement, but also in\nthe praiseworthy intention of bestowing them upon Selenite inns.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said Barbicane, \"if the moon is inhabited its inhabitants\nappeared some thousands of years before those of the earth, for it\ncannot be doubted that the moon is older than the earth. If, therefore,\nthe Selenites have existed for thousands of centuries--if their brains\nare organised like that of human beings--they have invented all that we\nhave invented, already, and even what we shall only invent in the lapse\nof centuries. They will have nothing to learn from us, and we shall have\neverything to learn from them.\"\n\n\"What!\" answered Michel, \"do you think they have had artists like\nPhidias, Michael Angelo, or Raphael?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Poets like Homer, Virgil, Milton, Lamartine, and Hugo?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"Philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant?\"\n\n\"I have no doubt of it.\"\n\n\"_Savants_ like Archimedes, Euclid, Pascal, and Newton?\"\n\n\"I could swear it.\"\n\n\"Clowns like Arnal, and photographers like--Nadar?\"\n\n\"I am certain of it.\"\n\n\"Then, friend Barbicane, if these Selenites are as learned as we, and\neven more so, why have they not hurled a lunar projectile as far as the\nterrestrial regions?\"\n\n\"Who says they have not done it?\" answered Barbicane seriously.\n\n\"In fact,\" added Nicholl, \"it would have been easier to them than to us,\nand that for two reasons--the first because the attraction is six times\nless on the surface of the moon than on the surface of the earth, which\nwould allow a projectile to go up more easily; secondly the projectile\nwould only have 8,000 leagues to travel instead of 80,000, which would\nrequire a force of propulsion ten times less.\"\n\n\"Then,\" resumed Michel, \"I repeat--why have they not done it?\"\n\n\"And I,\" replied Barbicane, \"I repeat--who says they have not done it?\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Hundreds of centuries ago, before man's appearance upon earth.\"\n\n\"And the bullet? Where is the bullet? I ask to see the bullet!\"\n\n\"My friend,\" answered Barbicane, \"the sea covers five-sixths of our\nglobe, hence there are five good reasons for supposing that the lunar\nprojectile, if it has been fired, is now submerged at the bottom of the\nAtlantic or Pacific, unless it was buried down some abyss at the epoch\nwhen the earth's crust was not sufficiently formed.\"\n\n\"Old fellow,\" answered Michel, \"you have an answer to everything, and I\nbow before your wisdom. There is one hypothesis I would rather believe\nthan the others, and that is that the Selenites being older than we are\nwiser, and have not invented gunpowder at all.\"\n\nAt that moment Diana claimed her share in the conversation by a sonorous\nbark. She asked for her breakfast.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Michel Ardan, \"our arguments make us forget Diana and\nSatellite!\"\n\nA good dish of food was immediately offered to the dog, who devoured it\nwith great appetite.\n\n\"Do you know, Barbicane,\" said Michel, \"we ought to have made this\nprojectile a sort of Noah's Ark, and have taken a couple of all the\ndomestic animals with us to the moon.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" answered Barbicane, \"but we should not have had room\nenough.\"\n\n\"Oh, we might have been packed a little tighter!\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" answered Nicholl, \"that oxen, cows, bulls, and horses,\nall those ruminants would be useful on the lunar continent.\nUnfortunately we cannot make our projectile either a stable or a\ncowshed.\"\n\n\"But at least,\" said Michel Ardan, \"we might have brought an ass,\nnothing but a little ass, the courageous and patient animal old Silenus\nloved to exhibit. I am fond of those poor asses! They are the least\nfavoured animals in creation. They are not only beaten during their\nlifetime, but are still beaten after their death!\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" asked Barbicane.\n\n\"Why, don't they use his skin to make drums of?\"\n\nBarbicane and Nicholl could not help laughing at this absurd reflection.\nBut a cry from their merry companion stopped them; he was bending over\nSatellite's niche, and rose up saying--\n\n\"Good! Satellite is no longer ill.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"No!\" resumed Michel, \"he is dead. Now,\" he added in a pitiful tone,\n\"this will be embarrassing! I very much fear, poor Diana, that you will\nnot leave any of your race in the lunar regions!\"\n\nThe unfortunate Satellite had not been able to survive his wounds. He\nwas dead, stone dead. Michel Ardan, much put out of countenance, looked\nat his friends.\n\n\"This makes another difficulty,\" said Barbicane. \"We can't keep the dead\nbody of this dog with us for another eight-and-forty hours.\"\n\n\"No, certainly not,\" answered Nicholl, \"but our port-lights are hung\nupon hinges. They can be let down. We will open one of them, and throw\nthe body into space.\"\n\nThe president reflected for a few minutes, and then said--\n\n\"Yes, that is what we must do, but we must take the most minute\nprecautions.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Michel.\n\n\"For two reasons that I will explain to you,\" answered Barbicane. \"The\nfirst has reference to the air in the projectile, of which we must lose\nas little as possible.\"\n\n\"But we can renew the air!\"\n\n\"Not entirely. We can only renew the oxygen, Michel; and, by-the-bye, we\nmust be careful that the apparatus do not furnish us with this oxygen in\nan immoderate quantity, for an excess of it would cause grave\nphysiological consequences. But although we can renew the oxygen we\ncannot renew the azote, that medium which the lungs do not absorb, and\nwhich ought to remain intact. Now the azote would rapidly escape if the\nport-lights were opened.\"\n\n\"Not just the time necessary to throw poor Satellite out.\"\n\n\"Agreed; but we must do it quickly.\"\n\n\"And what is the second reason?\" asked Michel.\n\n\"The second reason is that we must not allow the exterior cold, which is\nexcessive, to penetrate into our projectile lest we should be frozen\nalive.\"\n\n\"Still the sun--\"\n\n\"The sun warms our projectile because it absorbs its rays, but it does\nnot warm the void we are in now. When there is no air there is no more\nheat than there is diffused light, and where the sun's rays do not reach\ndirectly it is both dark and cold. The temperature outside is only that\nproduced by the radiation of the stars--that is to say, the same as the\ntemperature of the terrestrial globe would be if one day the sun were to\nbe extinguished.\"\n\n\"No fear of that,\" answered Nicholl.\n\n\"Who knows?\" said Michel Ardan. \"And even supposing that the sun be not\nextinguished, it might happen that the earth will move farther away from\nit.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Nicholl; \"that's one of Michel's ideas!\"\n\n\"Well,\" resumed Michel, \"it is well known that in 1861 the earth went\nthrough the tail of a comet. Now suppose there was a comet with a power\nof attraction greater than that of the sun, the terrestrial globe might\nmake a curve towards the wandering star, and the earth would become its\nsatellite, and would be dragged away to such a distance that the rays of\nthe sun would have no action on its surface.\"\n\n\"That might happen certainly,\" answered Barbicane, \"but the consequences\nwould not be so redoubtable as you would suppose.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Because heat and cold would still be pretty well balanced upon our\nglobe. It has been calculated that if the earth had been carried away by\nthe comet of 1861, it would only have felt, when at its greatest\ndistance from the sun, a heat sixteen times greater than that sent to us\nby the moon--a heat which, when focussed by the strongest lens, produces\nno appreciable effect.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Michel.\n\n\"Wait a little,\" answered Barbicane. \"It has been calculated that at its\nperihelion, when nearest to the sun, the earth would have borne a heat\nequal to 28,000 times that of summer. But this heat, capable of\nvitrifying terrestrial matters, and of evaporating water, would have\nformed a thick circle of clouds which would have lessened the excessive\nheat, hence there would be compensation between the cold of the aphelion\nand the heat of the perihelion, and an average probably supportable.\"\n\n\"At what number of degrees do they estimate the temperature of the\nplanetary space?\"\n\n\"Formerly,\" answered Barbicane, \"it was believed that this temperature\nwas exceedingly low. By calculating its thermometric diminution it was\nfixed at millions of degrees below zero. It was Fourier, one of Michel's\ncountrymen, an illustrious _savant_ of the _Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences_, who\nreduced these numbers to a juster estimation. According to him, the\ntemperature of space does not get lower than 60\u00b0 Centigrade.\"\n\nMichel whistled.\n\n\"It is about the temperature of the polar regions,\" answered Barbicane,\n\"at Melville Island or Fort Reliance--about 56\u00b0 Centigrade below zero.\"\n\n\"It remains to be proved,\" said Nicholl, \"that Fourier was not mistaken\nin his calculations. If I am not mistaken, another Frenchman, M.\nPouillet, estimates the temperature of space at 160\u00b0 below zero. We\nshall be able to verify that.\"\n\n\"Not now,\" answered Barbicane, \"for the solar rays striking directly\nupon our thermometer would give us, on the contrary, a very elevated\ntemperature. But when we get upon the moon, during the nights, a\nfortnight long, which each of its faces endures alternately, we shall\nhave leisure to make the experiment, for our satellite moves in the\nvoid.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by the void?\" asked Michel; \"is it absolute void?\"\n\n\"It is absolutely void of air.\"\n\n\"Is there nothing in its place?\"\n\n\"Yes, ether,\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"Ah! and what is ether?\"\n\n\"Ether, my friend, is an agglomeration of imponderable particles, which,\nrelatively to their dimensions, are as far removed from each other as\nthe celestial bodies are in space, so say works on molecular physics. It\nis these atoms that by their vibrating movement produce light and heat\nby making four hundred and thirty billions of oscillations a second.\"\n\n\"Millions of millions!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan; \"then _savants_ have\nmeasured and counted these oscillations! All these figures, friend\nBarbicane, are _savants'_ figures, which reach the ear but say nothing\nto the mind.\"\n\n\"But they are obliged to have recourse to figures.\"\n\n\"No. It would be much better to compare. A billion signifies nothing. An\nobject of comparison explains everything. Example--When you tell me that\nUranus is 76 times larger than the earth, Saturn 900 times larger,\nJupiter 1,300 times larger, the sun 1,300,000 times larger, I am not\nmuch wiser. So I much prefer the old comparisons of the _Double\nLi\u00e9goise_ that simply tells you, 'The sun is a pumpkin two feet in\ndiameter, Jupiter an orange, Saturn a Blenheim apple, Neptune a large\ncherry, Uranus a smaller cherry, the earth a pea, Venus a green pea,\nMars the head of a large pin, Mercury a grain of mustard, and Juno,\nCeres, Vesta, and Pallas fine grains of sand!' Then I know what it\nmeans!\"\n\nAfter this tirade of Michel Ardan's against _savants_ and their\nbillions, which he delivered without stopping to take breath, they set\nabout burying Satellite. He was to be thrown into space like sailors\nthrow a corpse into the sea.\n\nAs President Barbicane had recommended, they had to act quickly so as to\nlose as little air as possible. The bolts upon the right-hand port-hole\nwere carefully unscrewed, and an opening of about half a yard made,\nwhilst Michel prepared to hurl his dog into space. The window, worked by\na powerful lever, which conquered the pressure of air in the interior\nupon the sides of the projectile, moved upon its hinges, and Satellite\nwas thrown out. Scarcely a particle of air escaped, and the operation\nsucceeded so well that later on Barbicane did not fear to get rid of all\nthe useless rubbish that encumbered the vehicle in the same way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.\n\n\nOn the 4th of December, at 5 a.m. by terrestrial reckoning, the\ntravellers awoke, having been fifty-four hours on their journey. They\nhad only been five hours and forty minutes more than half the time\nassigned for the accomplishment of their journey, but they had come more\nthan seven-tenths of the distance. This peculiarity was due to their\nregularly-decreasing speed.\n\nWhen they looked at the earth through the port-light at the bottom, it\nonly looked like a black spot drowned in the sun's rays. No crescent or\npale light was now to be seen. The next day at midnight the earth would\nbe new at the precise moment when the moon would be full. Above, the\nQueen of Night was nearing the line followed by the projectile, so as to\nmeet it at the hour indicated. All around the dark vault was studded\nwith brilliant specks which seemed to move slowly; but through the great\ndistance they were at their relative size did not seem to alter much.\nThe sun and the stars appeared exactly as they do from the earth. The\nmoon was considerably enlarged; but the travellers' not very powerful\ntelescopes did not as yet allow them to make very useful observations on\nher surface, or to reconnoitre the topographical or geological details.\n\nThe time went by in interminable conversations. The talk was especially\nabout the moon. Each brought his contingent of particular knowledge.\nBarbicane's and Nicholl's were always serious, Michel Ardan's always\nfanciful. The projectile, its situation and direction, the incidents\nthat might arise, the precautions necessitated by its fall upon the\nmoon, all this afforded inexhaustible material for conjecture.\n\nWhilst breakfasting a question of Michel's relative to the projectile\nprovoked a rather curious answer from Barbicane, and one worthy of being\nrecorded.\n\nMichel, supposing the bullet to be suddenly stopped whilst still endowed\nwith its formidable initial velocity, wished to know what the\nconsequences would have been.\n\n\"But,\" answered Barbicane, \"I don't see how the projectile could have\nbeen stopped.\"\n\n\"But let us suppose it,\" answered Nicholl.\n\n\"It is an impossible supposition,\" replied the practical president,\n\"unless the force of impulsion had failed. But in that case its speed\nwould have gradually decreased, and would not have stopped abruptly.\"\n\n\"Admit that it had struck against some body in space.\"\n\n\"What body?\"\n\n\"The enormous meteor we met.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Nicholl, \"the projectile would have been broken into a\nthousand pieces, and we with it.\"\n\n\"More than that,\" answered Barbicane, \"we should have been burnt alive.\"\n\n\"Burnt!\" exclaimed Michel. \"I regret it did not happen for us just to\nsee.\"\n\n\"And you would have seen with a vengeance,\" answered Barbicane. \"It is\nnow known that heat is only a modification of movement when water is\nheated--that is to say, when heat is added to it--that means the giving\nof movement to its particles.\"\n\n\"That is an ingenious theory!\" said Michel.\n\n\"And a correct one, my worthy friend, for it explains all the phenomena\nof caloric. Heat is only molecular movement, a single oscillation of the\nparticles of a body. When the break is put on a train it stops. But what\nbecomes of the movement which animated it? Why do they grease the axles\nof the wheels? In order to prevent them catching fire from the movement\nlost by transformation. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Admirably,\" answered Michel. \"For example, when I have been running\nsome time, and am covered with sweat, why am I forced to stop? Simply\nbecause my movement has been transformed into heat.\"\n\nBarbicane could not help laughing at this _r\u00e9partie_ of Michel's. Then\nresuming his theory--\n\n\"Thus,\" said he, \"in case of a collision, it would have happened to our\nprojectile as it does to the metal cannon-ball after striking\narmour-plate; it would fall burning, because its movement had been\ntransformed into heat. In consequence, I affirm that if our bullet had\nstruck against the asteroid, its speed, suddenly annihilated, would have\nproduced heat enough to turn it immediately into vapour.\"\n\n\"Then,\" asked Nicholl, \"what would happen if the earth were to be\nsuddenly stopped in her movement of translation?\"\n\n\"Her temperature would be carried to such a point,\" answered Barbicane,\n\"that she would be immediately reduced to vapour.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Michel; \"that means of ending the world would simplify many\nthings.\"\n\n\"And suppose the earth were to fall upon the sun?\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"According to calculations,\" answered Barbicane, \"that would develop a\nheat equal to that produced by 1,600 globes of coal, equal in volume to\nthe terrestrial globe.\"\n\n\"A good increase of temperature for the sun,\" replied Michel Ardan, \"of\nwhich the inhabitants of Uranus or Neptune will probably not complain,\nfor they must be dying of cold on their planet.\"\n\n\"Thus, then, my friends, any movement suddenly stopped produces heat.\nThis theory makes it supposed that the sun is constantly fed by an\nincessant fall of bodies upon its surface. It has been calculated--\"\n\n\"Now I shall be crushed,\" murmured Michel, \"for figures are coming.\"\n\n\"It has been calculated,\" continued Barbicane imperturbably, \"that the\nshock of each asteroid upon the sun must produce heat equal to that of\n4,000 masses of coal of equal volume.\"\n\n\"And what is the heat of the sun?\" asked Michel.\n\n\"It is equal to that which would be produced by a stratum of coal\nsurrounding the sun to a depth of twenty-seven kilometres.\"\n\n\"And that heat--\"\n\n\"Could boil 2,900,000,000 of cubic myriametres of water an hour.\" (A\nmyriametre is equal to rather more than 6.2138 miles, or 6 miles 1\nfurlong 28 poles.)\n\n\"And we are not roasted by it?\" cried Michel.\n\n\"No,\" answered Barbicane, \"because the terrestrial atmosphere absorbs\nfour-tenths of the solar heat. Besides, the quantity of heat intercepted\nby the earth is only two thousand millionth of the total.\"\n\n\"I see that all is for the best,\" replied Michel, \"and that our\natmosphere is a useful invention, for it not only allows us to breathe,\nbut actually prevents us roasting.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Nicholl, \"but, unfortunately, it will not be the same on the\nmoon.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Michel, always confident. \"If there are any inhabitants they\nbreathe. If there are no longer any they will surely have left enough\noxygen for three people, if only at the bottom of those ravines where it\nwill have accumulated by reason of its weight! Well, we shall not climb\nthe mountains! That is all.\"\n\nAnd Michel, getting up, went to look at the lunar disc, which was\nshining with intolerable brilliancy.\n\n\"Faith!\" said he, \"it must be hot up there.\"\n\n\"Without reckoning,\" answered Nicholl, \"that daylight lasts 360 hours.\"\n\n\"And by way of compensation night has the same duration,\" said\nBarbicane, \"and as heat is restored by radiation, their temperature must\nbe that of planetary space.\"\n\n\"A fine country truly!\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"Never mind! I should like to be there already! It will be comical to\nhave the earth for a moon, to see it rise on the horizon, to recognise\nthe configuration of its continents, to say to oneself, 'There's America\nand there's Europe;' then to follow it till it is lost in the rays of\nthe sun! By-the-bye, Barbicane, have the Selenites any eclipses?\"\n\n\"Yes, eclipses of the sun,\" answered Barbicane, \"when the centres of the\nthree stars are on the same line with the earth in the middle. But they\nare merely annular eclipses, during which the earth, thrown like a\nscreen across the solar disc, allows the greater part to be seen.\"\n\n\"Why is there no total eclipse?\" asked Nicholl. \"Is it because the cone\nof shade thrown by the earth does not extend beyond the moon?\"\n\n\"Yes, if you do not take into account the refraction produced by the\nterrestrial atmosphere, not if you do take that refraction into account.\nThus, let _delta_ be the horizontal parallax and _p_ the apparent\nsemidiameter--\"\n\n\"Ouf!\" said Michel, \"half of _v_ zero square! Do speak the vulgar\ntongue, man of algebra!\"\n\n\"Well, then, in popular language,\" answered Barbicane, \"the mean\ndistance between the moon and the earth being sixty terrestrial radii,\nthe length of the cone of shadow, by dint of refraction, is reduced to\nless than forty-two radii. It follows, therefore, that during the\neclipses the moon is beyond the cone of pure shade, and the sun sends it\nnot only rays from its edges, but also rays from its centre.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Michel in a grumbling tone, \"why is there any eclipse when\nthere ought to be none?\"\n\n\"Solely because the solar rays are weakened by the refraction, and the\natmosphere which they traverse extinguishes the greater part of them.\"\n\n\"That reason satisfies me,\" answered Michel; \"besides, we shall see for\nourselves when we get there. Now, Barbicane, do you believe that the\nmoon is an ancient comet?\"\n\n\"What an idea!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Michel, with amiable conceit, \"I have a few ideas of that\nkind.\"\n\n\"But that idea does not originate with Michel,\" answered Nicholl.\n\n\"Then I am only a plagiarist.\"\n\n\"Without doubt,\" answered Nicholl. \"According to the testimony of the\nancients, the Arcadians pretended that their ancestors inhabited the\nearth before the moon became her satellite. Starting from this fact,\ncertain _savants_ think the moon was a comet which its orbit one day\nbrought near enough to the earth to be retained by terrestrial\nattraction.\"\n\n\"And what truth is there in that hypothesis?\" asked Michel.\n\n\"None,\" answered Barbicane, \"and the proof is that the moon has not kept\na trace of the gaseous envelope that always accompanies comets.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Nicholl, \"might not the moon, before becoming the earth's\nsatellite, have passed near enough to the sun to leave all her gaseous\nsubstances by evaporation?\"\n\n\"It might, friend Nicholl, but it is not probable.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because--because, I really don't know.\"\n\n\"Ah, what hundreds of volumes we might fill with what we don't know!\"\nexclaimed Michel. \"But I say,\" he continued, \"what time is it?\"\n\n\"Three o'clock,\" answered Nicholl.\n\n\"How the time goes,\" said Michel, \"in the conversation of _savants_ like\nus! Decidedly I feel myself getting too learned! I feel that I am\nbecoming a well of knowledge!\"\n\nSo saying, Michel climbed to the roof of the projectile, \"in order\nbetter to observe the moon,\" he pretended. In the meanwhile his\ncompanions watched the vault of space through the lower port-light.\nThere was nothing fresh to signalise.\n\nWhen Michel Ardan came down again he approached the lateral port-light,\nand suddenly uttered an exclamation of surprise.\n\n\"What is the matter now?\" asked Barbicane.\n\nThe president approached the glass and saw a sort of flattened sack\nfloating outside at some yards' distance from the projectile. This\nobject seemed motionless like the bullet, and was consequently animated\nwith the same ascensional movement.\n\n\"Whatever can that machine be?\" said Michel Ardan. \"Is it one of the\ncorpuscles of space which our projectile holds in its radius of\nattraction, and which will accompany it as far as the moon?\"\n\n\"What I am astonished at,\" answered Nicholl, \"is that the specific\nweight of this body, which is certainly superior to that of the bullet,\nallows it to maintain itself so rigorously on its level.\"\n\n\"Nicholl,\" said Barbicane, after a moment's reflection, \"I do not know\nwhat that object is, but I know perfectly why it keeps on a level with\nthe projectile.\"\n\n\"Why, pray?\"\n\n\"Because we are floating in the void where bodies fall or move--which is\nthe same thing--with equal speed whatever their weight or form may be.\nIt is the air which, by its resistance, creates differences in weight.\nWhen you pneumatically create void in a tube, the objects you throw down\nit, either lead or feathers, fall with the same rapidity. Here in space\nyou have the same cause and the same effect.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Nicholl, \"and all we throw out of the projectile will\naccompany us to the moon.\"\n\n\"Ah! what fools we are!\" cried Michel.\n\n\"Why this qualification?\" asked Barbicane.\n\n\"Because we ought to have filled the projectile with useful objects,\nbooks, instruments, tools, &c. We could have thrown them all out, and\nthey would all have followed in our wake! But, now I think of it, why\ncan't we take a walk outside this? Why can't we go into space through\nthe port-light? What delight it would be to be thus suspended in ether,\nmore favoured even than birds that are forced to flap their wings to\nsustain them!\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said Barbicane, \"but how are we to breathe?\"\n\n\"Confounded air to fail so inopportunely!\"\n\n\"But if it did not fail, Michel, your density being inferior to that of\nthe projectile, you would soon remain behind.\"\n\n\"Then it is a vicious circle.\"\n\n\"All that is most vicious.\"\n\n\"And we must remain imprisoned in our vehicle.\"\n\n\"Yes, we must.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Michel in a formidable voice.\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" asked Nicholl.\n\n\"I know, I guess what this pretended asteroid is! It is not a broken\npiece of planet!\"\n\n\"What is it, then?\" asked Nicholl.\n\n\"It is our unfortunate dog! It is Diana's husband!\"\n\nIn fact, this deformed object, reduced to nothing, and quite\nunrecognisable, was the body of Satellite flattened like a bagpipe\nwithout wind, and mounting, for ever mounting!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nA MOMENT OF INTOXICATION.\n\n\nThus a curious but logical, strange yet logical phenomenon took place\nunder these singular conditions. Every object thrown out of the\nprojectile would follow the same trajectory and only stop when it did.\nThat furnished a text for conversation which the whole evening could not\nexhaust. The emotion of the three travellers increased as they\napproached the end of their journey. They expected unforeseen incidents,\nfresh phenomena, and nothing would have astonished them under present\ncircumstances. Their excited imagination outdistanced the projectile,\nthe speed of which diminished notably without their feeling it. But the\nmoon grew larger before their eyes, and they thought they had only to\nstretch out their hands to touch it.\n\nThe next day, the 5th of December, they were all wide awake at 5 a.m.\nThat day was to be the last of their journey if the calculations were\nexact. That same evening, at midnight, within eighteen hours, at the\nprecise moment of full moon, they would reach her brilliant disc. The\nnext midnight would bring them to the goal of their journey, the most\nextraordinary one of ancient or modern times. At early dawn, through the\nwindows made silvery with her rays, they saluted the Queen of Night with\na confident and joyful hurrah.\n\nThe moon was sailing majestically across the starry firmament. A few\nmore degrees and she would reach that precise point in space where the\nprojectile was to meet her. According to his own observations, Barbicane\nthought that he should accost her in her northern hemisphere, where vast\nplains extend and mountains are rare--a favourable circumstance if the\nlunar atmosphere was, according to received opinion, stored up in deep\nplaces only.\n\n\"Besides,\" observed Michel Ardan, \"a plain is more suitable for landing\nupon than a mountain. A Selenite landed in Europe on the summit of Mont\nBlanc, or in Asia on a peak of the Himalayas, would not be precisely at\nhis destination!\"\n\n\"What is more,\" added Nicholl, \"on a plain the projectile will remain\nmotionless after it has touched the ground, whilst it would roll down a\nhill like an avalanche, and as we are not squirrels we should not come\nout safe and sound. Therefore all is for the best.\"\n\nIn fact, the success of the audacious enterprise no longer appeared\ndoubtful. Still one reflection occupied Barbicane; but not wishing to\nmake his two companions uneasy, he kept silence upon it.\n\nThe direction of the projectile towards the northern hemisphere proved\nthat its trajectory had been slightly modified. The aim, mathematically\ncalculated, ought to have sent the bullet into the very centre of the\nlunar disc. If it did not arrive there it would be because it had\ndeviated. What had caused it? Barbicane could not imagine nor determine\nthe importance of this deviation, for there was no datum to go upon. He\nhoped, however, that the only result would be to take them towards the\nupper edge of the moon, a more suitable region for landing.\n\nBarbicane, therefore, without saying anything to his friends, contented\nhimself with frequently observing the moon, trying to see if the\ndirection of the projectile would not change. For the situation would\nhave been so terrible had the bullet, missing its aim, been dragged\nbeyond the lunar disc and fallen into interplanetary space.\n\nAt that moment the moon, instead of appearing flat like a disc, already\nshowed her convexity. If the sun's rays had reached her obliquely the\nshadow then thrown would have made the high mountains stand out. They\ncould have seen the gaping craters and the capricious furrows that cut\nup the immense plains. But all relief was levelled in the intense\nbrilliancy. Those large spots that give the appearance of a human face\nto the moon were scarcely distinguishable.\n\n\"It may be a face,\" said Michel Ardan, \"but I am sorry for the amiable\nsister of Apollo, her face is so freckled!\"\n\nIn the meantime the travellers so near their goal ceaselessly watched\nthis new world. Their imagination made them take walks over these\nunknown countries. They climbed the elevated peaks. They descended to\nthe bottom of the large amphitheatres. Here and there they thought they\nsaw vast seas scarcely kept together under an atmosphere so rarefied,\nand streams of water that poured them their tribute from the mountains.\nLeaning over the abyss they hoped to catch the noise of this orb for\never mute in the solitudes of the void.\n\nThis last day left them the liveliest remembrances. They noted down the\nleast details. A vague uneasiness took possession of them as they\napproached their goal. This uneasiness would have been doubled if they\nhad felt how slight their speed was. It appeared quite insufficient to\ntake them to the end of their journey. This was because the projectile\nscarcely \"weighed\" anything. Its weight constantly decreased, and would\nbe entirely annihilated on that line where the lunar and terrestrial\nattractions neutralise each other, causing surprising effects.\n\nNevertheless, in spite of his preoccupations, Michel Ardan did not\nforget to prepare the morning meal with his habitual punctuality. They\nate heartily. Nothing was more excellent than their broth liquefied by\nthe heat of the gas. Nothing better than these preserved meats. A few\nglasses of good French wine crowned the repast, and caused Michel Ardan\nto remark that the lunar vines, warmed by this ardent sun, ought to\ndistil the most generous wines--that is, if they existed. Any way, the\nfar-seeing Frenchman had taken care not to forget in his collection some\nprecious cuttings of the M\u00e9doc and C\u00f4te d'Or, upon which he counted\nparticularly.\n\nThe Reiset and Regnault apparatus always worked with extreme precision.\nThe air was kept in a state of perfect purity. Not a particle of\ncarbonic acid resisted the potash, and as to the oxygen, that, as\nCaptain Nicholl said, was of \"first quality.\" The small amount of\nhumidity in the projectile mixed with this air and tempered its dryness,\nand many Paris, London, or New York apartments and many theatres do not\ncertainly fulfil hygienic conditions so well.\n\nBut in order to work regularly this apparatus had to be kept going\nregularly. Each morning Michel inspected the escape regulators, tried\nthe taps, and fixed by the pyrometer the heat of the gas. All had gone\nwell so far, and the travellers, imitating the worthy J.T. Maston, began\nto get so stout that they would not be recognisable if their\nimprisonment lasted several months. They behaved like chickens in a\ncage--they fattened.\n\nLooking through the port lights Barbicane saw the spectre of the\ndog, and the different objects thrown out of the projectile, which\nobstinately accompanied it. Diana howled lamentably when she perceived\nthe remains of Satellite. All the things seemed as motionless as if they\nhad rested upon solid ground.\n\n\"Do you know, my friends,\" said Michel Ardan, \"that if one of us had\nsuccumbed to the recoil shock at departure we should have been much\nembarrassed as to how to get rid of him? You see the accusing corpse\nwould have followed us in space like remorse!\"\n\n\"That would have been sad,\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"Ah!\" continued Michel, \"what I regret is our not being able to take a\nwalk outside. What delight it would be to float in this radiant ether,\nto bathe in these pure rays of the sun! If Barbicane had only thought of\nfurnishing us with diving-dresses and air-pumps I should have ventured\noutside, and have assumed the attitude of a flying-horse on the summit\nof the projectile.\"\n\n\"Ah, old fellow!\" answered Barbicane, \"you would not have stayed there\nlong in spite of your diving-dress; you would have burst like an obus by\nthe expansion of air inside you, or rather like a balloon that goes up\ntoo high. So regret nothing, and do not forget this: while we are moving\nin the void you must do without any sentimental promenade out of the\nprojectile.\"\n\nMichel Ardan allowed himself to be convinced in a certain measure. He\nagreed that the thing was difficult, but not \"impossible;\" that was a\nword he never uttered.\n\nThe conversation passed from this subject to another, and never\nlanguished an instant. It seemed to the three friends that under these\nconditions ideas came into their heads like leaves in the first warm\ndays of spring.\n\nAmidst the questions and answers that crossed each other during this\nmorning, Nicholl asked one that did not get an immediate solution.\n\n\"I say,\" said he, \"it is all very well to go to the moon, but how shall\nwe get back again?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that, Nicholl?\" asked Barbicane gravely.\n\n\"It seems to me very inopportune to ask about getting away from a\ncountry before you get to it,\" added Michel.\n\n\"I don't ask that question because I want to draw back, but I repeat my\nquestion, and ask, 'How shall we get back?'\"\n\n\"I have not the least idea,\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"And as for me,\" said Michel, \"if I had known how to come back I should\nnot have gone.\"\n\n\"That is what you call answering,\" cried Nicholl.\n\n\"I approve of Michel's words, and add that the question has no actual\ninterest. We will think about that later on, when we want to return.\nThough the Columbiad will not be there, the projectile will.\"\n\n\"Much good that will be, a bullet without a gun!\"\n\n\"A gun can be made, and so can powder! Neither metal, saltpetre, nor\ncoal can be wanting in the bowels of the moon. Besides, in order to\nreturn you have only the lunar attraction to conquer, and you will only\nhave 8,000 leagues to go so as to fall on the terrestrial globe by the\nsimple laws of weight.\"\n\n\"That is enough,\" said Michel, getting animated. \"Let us hear no more\nabout returning. As to communicating with our ancient colleagues upon\nearth, that will not be difficult.\"\n\n\"How are we to do that, pray?\"\n\n\"By means of meteors hurled by the lunar volcanoes.\"\n\n\"A good idea, Michel,\" answered Barbicane. \"Laplace has calculated that\na force five times superior to that of our cannons would suffice to send\na meteor from the moon to the earth. Now there is no volcano that has\nnot a superior force of propulsion.\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Michel. \"Meteors will be convenient postmen and will not\ncost anything! And how we shall laugh at the postal service! But now I\nthink--\"\n\n\"What do you think?\"\n\n\"A superb idea! Why did we not fasten a telegraph wire to our bullet? We\ncould have exchanged telegrams with the earth!\"\n\n\"And the weight of a wire 86,000 leagues long,\" answered Nicholl, \"does\nthat go for nothing?\"\n\n\"Yes, for nothing! We should have trebled the charge of the Columbiad!\nWe could have made it four times--five times--greater!\" cried Michel,\nwhose voice became more and more violent.\n\n\"There is a slight objection to make to your project,\" answered\nBarbicane. \"It is that during the movement of rotation of the globe our\nwire would have been rolled round it like a chain round a windlass, and\nit would inevitably have dragged us down to the earth again.\"\n\n\"By the thirty-nine stars of the Union!\" said Michel, \"I have nothing\nbut impracticable ideas to-day--ideas worthy of J.T. Maston! But now I\nthink of it, if we do not return to earth J.T. Maston will certainly\ncome to us!\"\n\n\"Yes! he will come,\" replied Barbicane; \"he is a worthy and courageous\ncomrade. Besides, what could be easier? Is not the Columbiad still lying\nin Floridian soil? Is cotton and nitric acid wanting wherewith to\nmanufacture the projectile? Will not the moon again pass the zenith of\nFlorida? In another eighteen years will she not occupy exactly the same\nplace that she occupies to-day?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" repeated Michel--\"yes, Maston will come, and with him our friends\nElphinstone, Blomsberry, and all the members of the Gun Club, and they\nwill be welcome! Later on trains of projectiles will be established\nbetween the earth and the moon! Hurrah for J.T. Maston!\"\n\nIt is probable that if the Honourable J.T. Maston did not hear the\nhurrahs uttered in his honour his ears tingled at least. What was he\ndoing then? He was no doubt stationed in the Rocky Mountains at Long's\nPeak, trying to discover the invisible bullet gravitating in space. If\nhe was thinking of his dear companions it must be acknowledged that they\nwere not behindhand with him, and that, under the influence of singular\nexaltation, they consecrated their best thoughts to him.\n\nBut whence came the animation that grew visibly greater in the\ninhabitants of the projectile? Their sobriety could not be questioned.\nMust this strange erethismus of the brain be attributed to the\nexceptional circumstances of the time, to that proximity of the Queen of\nNight from which a few hours only separated them, or to some secret\ninfluence of the moon acting on their nervous system? Their faces became\nas red as if exposed to the reverberation of a furnace; their\nrespiration became more active, and their lungs played like\nforge-bellows; their eyes shone with extraordinary flame, and their\nvoices became formidably loud, their words escaped like a champagne-cork\ndriven forth by carbonic acid gas; their gestures became disquieting,\nthey wanted so much room to perform them in. And, strange to say, they\nin no wise perceived this excessive tension of the mind.\n\n\"Now,\" said Nicholl in a sharp tone--\"now that I do not know whether we\nshall come back from the moon, I will know what we are going there for!\"\n\n\"What we are going there for!\" answered Barbicane, stamping as if he\nwere in a fencing-room; \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"You don't know!\" cried Michel with a shout that provoked a sonorous\necho in the projectile.\n\n\"No, I have not the least idea!\" answered Barbicane, shouting in unison\nwith his interlocutor.\n\n\"Well, then, I know,\" answered Michel.\n\n\"Speak, then,\" said Nicholl, who could no longer restrain the angry\ntones of his voice.\n\n\"I shall speak if it suits me!\" cried Michel, violently seizing his\ncompanion's arm. \"It must suit you!\" said Barbicane, with eyes on fire\nand threatening hands. \"It was you who drew us into this terrible\njourney, and we wish to know why!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the captain, \"now I don't know where I am going, I will know\nwhy I am going.\"\n\n\"Why?\" cried Michel, jumping a yard high--\"why? To take possession of\nthe moon in the name of the United States! To add a fortieth State to\nthe Union! To colonise the lunar regions, to cultivate them, people\nthem, to take them all the wonders of art, science, and industry! To\ncivilise the Selenites, unless they are more civilised than we are, and\nto make them into a republic if they have not already done it for\nthemselves!\"\n\n\"If there are any Selenites!\" answered Nicholl, who under the empire of\nthis inexplicable intoxication became very contradictory.\n\n\"Who says there are no Selenites?\" cried Michel in a threatening tone.\n\n\"I do!\" shouted Nicholl.\n\n\"Captain,\" said Michel, \"do not repeat that insult or I will knock your\nteeth down your throat!\"\n\nThe two adversaries were about to rush upon one another, and this\nincoherent discussion was threatening to degenerate into a battle, when\nBarbicane interfered.\n\n\"Stop, unhappy men,\" said he, putting his two companions back to back,\n\"if there are no Selenites, we will do without them!\"\n\n\"Yes!\" exclaimed Michel, who did not care more about them than that. \"We\nhave nothing to do with the Selenites! Bother the Selenites!\"\n\n\"The empire of the moon shall be ours,\" said Nicholl. \"Let us found a\nRepublic of three!\"\n\n\"I shall be the Congress,\" cried Michel.\n\n\"And I the Senate,\" answered Nicholl.\n\n\"And Barbicane the President,\" shouted Michel.\n\n\"No President elected by the nation!\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"Well, then, a President elected by the Congress,\" exclaimed Michel;\n\"and as I am the Congress I elect you unanimously.\"\n\n\"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah for President Barbicane!\" exclaimed Nicholl.\n\n\"Hip--hip--hip! hurrah!\" vociferated Michel Ardan.\n\nThen the President and Senate struck up \"Yankee Doodle\" as loudly as\nthey could, whilst the Congress shouted the virile \"Marseillaise.\"\n\nThen began a frantic dance with maniacal gestures, mad stamping, and\nsomersaults of boneless clowns. Diana took part in the dance, howling\ntoo, and jumped to the very roof of the projectile. An inexplicable\nflapping of wings and cock-crows of singular sonority were heard. Five\nor six fowls flew about striking the walls like mad bats.\n\nThen the three travelling companions, whose lungs were disorganised\nunder some incomprehensible influence, more than intoxicated, burnt by\nthe air that had set their breathing apparatus on fire, fell motionless\nupon the bottom of the projectile.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nAT SEVENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN LEAGUES.\n\n\nWhat had happened? What was the cause of that singular intoxication, the\nconsequences of which might prove so disastrous? Simply carelessness on\nMichel's part, which Nicholl was able to remedy in time.\n\nAfter a veritable swoon, which lasted a few minutes, the captain, who\nwas the first to regain consciousness, soon collected his intellectual\nfaculties.\n\nAlthough he had breakfasted two hours before, he began to feel as hungry\nas if he had not tasted food for several days. His whole being, his\nbrain and stomach, were excited to the highest point.\n\nHe rose, therefore, and demanded a supplementary collation from Michel,\nwho was still unconscious, and did not answer. Nicholl, therefore,\nproceeded to prepare some cups of tea, in order to facilitate the\nabsorption of a dozen sandwiches. He busied himself first with lighting\na fire, and so struck a match.\n\nWhat was his surprise to see the sulphur burn with extraordinary and\nalmost unbearable brilliancy! From the jet of gas he lighted rose a\nflame equal to floods of electric light.\n\nA revelation took place in Nicholl's mind. This intensity of light, the\nphysiological disturbance in himself, the extra excitement of all his\nmoral and sensitive faculties--he understood it all.\n\n\"The oxygen!\" he exclaimed.\n\nAnd leaning over the air-apparatus, he saw that the tap was giving out a\nflood of colourless, savourless, and odourless gas, eminently vital, but\nwhich in a pure state produces the gravest disorders in the\nconstitution. Through carelessness Michel had left the tap full on.\nNicholl made haste to turn off this flow of oxygen with which the\natmosphere was saturated, and which would have caused the death of the\ntravellers, not by suffocation, but by combustion.\n\nAn hour afterwards the air was relieved, and gave their normal play to\nthe lungs. By degrees the three friends recovered from their\nintoxication; but they were obliged to recover from their oxygen like a\ndrunkard from his wine.\n\nWhen Michel knew his share of responsibility in this incident he did not\nappear in the least disconcerted. This unexpected intoxication broke the\nmonotony of the journey. Many foolish things had been said under its\ninfluence, but they had been forgotten as soon as said.\n\n\"Then,\" added the merry Frenchman, \"I am not sorry for having\nexperienced the effect of this captious gas. Do you know, my friends,\nthat there might be a curious establishment set up with oxygen-rooms,\nwhere people whose constitutions are weak might live a more active life\nduring a few hours at least? Suppose we had meetings where the air could\nbe saturated with this heroic fluid, theatres where the managers would\nsend it out in strong doses, what passion there would be in the souls of\nactors and spectators, what fire and what enthusiasm! And if, instead of\na simple assembly, a whole nation could be saturated with it, what\nactivity, what a supplement of life it would receive! Of an exhausted\nnation it perhaps would make a great and strong nation, and I know more\nthan one state in old Europe that ought to put itself under the oxygen\n_r\u00e9gime_ in the interest of its health.\"\n\nMichel spoke with as much animation as if the tap were still full on.\nBut with one sentence Barbicane damped his enthusiasm.\n\n\"All that is very well, friend Michel,\" he said, \"but now perhaps you\nwill tell us where those fowls that joined in our concert came from.\"\n\n\"Those fowls?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nIn fact, half-a-dozen hens and a superb cock were flying hither and\nthither.\n\n\"Ah, the stupids!\" cried Michel. \"It was the oxygen that put them in\nrevolt.\"\n\n\"But what are you going to do with those fowls?\" asked Barbicane.\n\n\"Acclimatise them in the moon of course! For the sake of a joke, my\nworthy president; simply a joke that has unhappily come to nothing! I\nwanted to let them out on the lunar continent without telling you! How\nastounded you would have been to see these terrestrial poultry pecking\nthe fields of the moon!\"\n\n\"Ah, _gamin_, you eternal boy!\" answered Barbicane, \"you don't want\noxygen to make you out of your senses! You are always what we were under\nthe influence of this gas! You are always insane!\"\n\n\"Ah! how do we know we were not wiser then?\" replied Michel Ardan.\n\nAfter this philosophical reflection the three friends repaired the\ndisorder in the projectile. Cock and hens were put back in their cage.\nBut as they were doing this Barbicane and his two companions distinctly\nperceived a fresh phenomenon.\n\nSince the moment they had left the earth their own weight, that of the\nbullet and the objects it contained, had suffered progressive\ndiminution. Though they could not have any experience of this in the\nprojectile, a moment must come when the effect upon themselves and the\ntools and instruments they used would be felt.\n\nOf course scales would not have indicated this loss of weight, for the\nweights used would have lost precisely as much as the object itself; but\na spring weighing-machine, the tension of which is independent of\nattraction, would have given the exact valuation of this diminution.\n\nIt is well known that attraction, or weight, is in proportion to the\nbulk, and in inverse proportion to the square of distances. Hence this\nconsequence. If the earth had been alone in space, if the other heavenly\nbodies were to be suddenly annihilated, the projectile, according to\nNewton's law, would have weighed less according to its distance from the\nearth, but without ever losing its weight entirely, for the terrestrial\nattraction would always have made itself felt, no matter at what\ndistance.\n\nBut in the case with which we are dealing, a moment must come when the\nprojectile would not be at all under the law of gravitation, after\nallowing for the other celestial bodies, whose effect could not be set\ndown as zero.\n\nIn fact, the trajectory of the projectile was between the earth and the\nmoon. As it went farther away from the earth terrestrial attraction\nwould be diminished in inverse proportion to the square of distances,\nbut the lunar attraction would be augmented in the same proportion. A\npoint must, therefore, be reached where these two attractions would\nneutralise each other, and the bullet would have no weight at all. If\nthe volumes of the moon and earth were equal, this point would have been\nreached at an equal distance between the two bodies. But by taking their\ndifference of bulk into account it was easy to calculate that this\npoint would be situated at 47/52 of the journey, or at 78,114 leagues\nfrom the earth.\n\nAt this point a body that had no principle of velocity or movement in\nitself would remain eternally motionless, being equally attracted by the\ntwo heavenly bodies, and nothing drawing it more towards one than the\nother.\n\nNow if the force of impulsion had been exactly calculated the projectile\nought to reach that point with no velocity, having lost all weight like\nthe objects it contained.\n\nWhat would happen then? Three hypotheses presented themselves.\n\nEither the projectile would have kept some velocity, and passing the\npoint of equal attraction, would fall on the moon by virtue of the\nexcess of lunar attraction over terrestrial attraction.\n\nOr velocity sufficient to reach the neutral point being wanting, it\nwould fall back on the earth by virtue of the excess of terrestrial\nattraction over lunar attraction.\n\nOr lastly, endowed with sufficient velocity to reach the neutral point,\nbut insufficient to pass it, it would remain eternally suspended in the\nsame place, like the pretended coffin of Mahomet, between the zenith and\nnadir.\n\nSuch was the situation, and Barbicane clearly explained the consequences\nto his travelling companions. They were interested to the highest\ndegree. How were they to know when they had reached this neutral point,\nsituated at 78,114 leagues from the earth, at the precise moment when\nneither they nor the objects contained in the projectile should be in\nany way subject to the laws of weight?\n\nUntil now the travellers, though they had remarked that this action\ndiminished little by little, had not yet perceived its total absence.\nBut that day, about 11 a.m., Nicholl having let a tumbler escape from\nhis hand, instead of falling, it remained suspended in the air.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Michel Ardan, \"this is a little amusing chemistry!\"\n\nAnd immediately different objects, weapons, bottles, &c, left to\nthemselves, hung suspended as if by miracle. Diana, too, lifted up by\nMichel into space, reproduced, but without trickery, the marvellous\nsuspensions effected by Robert-Houdin and Maskelyne and Cook.\n\nThe three adventurous companions, surprised and stupefied in spite of\ntheir scientific reasoning, carried into the domain of the marvellous,\nfelt weight go out of their bodies. When they stretched out their arms\nthey felt no inclination to drop them. Their heads vacillated on their\nshoulders. Their feet no longer kept at the bottom of the projectile.\nThey were like staggering drunkards. Imagination has created men\ndeprived of their reflection, others deprived of their shadows! But here\nreality, by the neutrality of active forces, made men in whom nothing\nhad any weight, and who weighed nothing themselves.\n\nSuddenly Michel, making a slight spring, left the floor and remained\nsuspended in the air like the good monk in Murillo's _Cuisine des\nAnges_. His two friends joined him in an instant, and all three, in the\ncentre of the projectile, figured a miraculous ascension.\n\n\"Is it believable? Is it likely? Is it possible?\" cried Michel. \"No. And\nyet it exists! Ah! if Raphael could have seen us like this what an\nAssumption he could have put upon canvas!\"\n\n\"The Assumption cannot last,\" answered Barbicane. \"If the projectile\npasses the neutral point, the lunar attraction will draw us to the\nmoon.\"\n\n\"Then our feet will rest upon the roof of the projectile,' answered\nMichel.\n\n\"No,\" said Barbicane, \"because the centre of gravity in the projectile\nis very low, and it will turn over gradually.\"\n\n\"Then all our things will be turned upside down for certain!\"\n\n\"Do not alarm yourself, Michel,\" answered Nicholl. \"There is nothing of\nthe kind to be feared. Not an object will move; the projectile will turn\ninsensibly.\"\n\n\"In fact,\" resumed Barbicane, \"when it has cleared the point of equal\nattraction, its bottom, relatively heavier, will drag it perpendicularly\ndown to the moon. But in order that such a phenomenon should take place\nwe must pass the neutral line.\"\n\n\"Passing the neutral line!\" cried Michel. \"Then let us do like the\nsailors who pass the equator--let us water our passage!\"\n\nA slight side movement took Michel to the padded wall. Thence he took a\nbottle and glasses, placed them \"in space\" before his companions, and\nmerrily touching glasses, they saluted the line with a triple hurrah.\n\nThis influence of the attractions lasted scarcely an hour. The\ntravellers saw themselves insensibly lowered towards the bottom, and\nBarbicane thought he remarked that the conical end of the projectile\ndeviated slightly from the normal direction towards the moon. By an\ninverse movement the bottom side approached it. Lunar attraction was\ntherefore gaining over terrestrial attraction. The fall towards the moon\nbegan, insensibly as yet; it could only be that of a millimetre (0.03937\ninch), and a third in the first second. But the attractive force would\ngradually increase, the fall would be more accentuated, the projectile,\ndragged down by its bottom side, would present its cone to the earth,\nand would fall with increasing velocity until it reached the Selenite\nsurface. Now nothing could prevent the success of the enterprise, and\nNicholl and Michel Ardan shared Barbicane's joy.\n\nThen they chatted about all the phenomena that had astounded them one\nafter another, especially about the neutralisation of the laws of\nweight. Michel Ardan, always full of enthusiasm, wished to deduce\nconsequences which were only pure imagination.\n\n\"Ah! my worthy friends,\" he cried, \"what progress we should make could\nwe but get rid upon earth of this weight, this chain that rivets us to\nher! It would be the prisoner restored to liberty! There would be no\nmore weariness either in arms or legs. And if it is true that, in order\nto fly upon the surface of the earth, to sustain yourself in the air by\na simple action of the muscles, it would take a force 150 times superior\nto that we possess, a simple act of will, a caprice, would transport us\ninto space, and attraction would not exist.\"\n\n\"In fact,\" said Nicholl, laughing, \"if they succeeded in suppressing\ngravitation, like pain is suppressed by anaesthesia, it would change the\nface of modern society!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried Michel, full of his subject, \"let us destroy weight and\nhave no more burdens! No more cranes, screw-jacks, windlasses, cranks,\nor other machines will be wanted.\"\n\n\"Well said,\" replied Barbicane; \"but if nothing had any weight nothing\nwould keep in its place, not even the hat on your head, worthy Michel;\nnor your house, the stones of which only adhere by their weight! Not\neven ships, whose stability upon the water is only a consequence of\nweight. Not even the ocean, whose waves would no longer be held in\nequilibrium by terrestrial attraction. Lastly, not even the atmosphere,\nthe molecules of which, being no longer held together, would disperse\ninto space!\"\n\n\"That is a pity,\" replied Michel. \"There is nothing like positive people\nfor recalling you brutally to reality!\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, console yourself, Michel,\" resumed Barbicane, \"for if no\nstar could exist from which the laws of weight were banished, you are at\nleast going to pay a visit where gravity is much less than upon earth.\"\n\n\"The moon?\"\n\n\"Yes, the moon, on the surface of which objects weigh six times less\nthan upon the surface of the earth, a phenomenon very easy to\ndemonstrate.\"\n\n\"And shall we perceive it?\" asked Michel. \"Evidently, for 400 lbs. only\nweigh 60 lbs. on the surface of the moon.\"\n\n\"Will not our muscular strength be diminished?\"\n\n\"Not at all. Instead of jumping one yard you will be able to rise six.\"\n\n\"Then we shall be Hercules in the moon,\" cried Michel.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Nicholl, \"and the more so because if the height of the\nSelenites is in proportion to the bulk of their globe they will be\nhardly a foot high.\"\n\n\"Liliputians!\" replied Michel. \"Then I am going to play the _r\u00f4le_ of\nGulliver! We shall realise the fable of the giants! That is the\nadvantage of leaving one's own planet to visit the solar world!\"\n\n\"But if you want to play Gulliver,\" answered Barbicane, \"only visit the\ninferior planets, such as Mercury, Venus, or Mars, whose bulk is rather\nless than that of the earth. But do not venture into the big planets,\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, for there the _r\u00f4les_ would be\ninverted, and you would become Liliputian.\"\n\n\"And in the sun?\"\n\n\"In the sun, though its density is four times less than that of the\nearth, its volume is thirteen hundred and twenty-four thousand times\ngreater, and gravitation there is twenty-seven times greater than upon\nthe surface of our globe. Every proportion kept, the inhabitants ought\non an average to be two hundred feet high.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" exclaimed Michel. \"I should only be a pigmy!\"\n\n\"Gulliver amongst the giants,\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"Just so,\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"It would not have been a bad thing to carry some pieces of artillery to\ndefend oneself with.\"\n\n\"Good,\" replied Barbicane; \"your bullets would have no effect on the\nsun, and they would fall to the ground in a few minutes.\"\n\n\"That's saying a great deal!\"\n\n\"It is a fact,\" answered Barbicane. \"Gravitation is so great on that\nenormous planet that an object weighing 70 lbs. on the earth would weigh\n1,930 lbs. on the surface of the sun. Your hat would weigh 20 lbs.! your\ncigar 1/2 lb.! Lastly, if you fell on the solar continent your weight\nwould be so great--about 5,000 lbs.--that you could not get up again.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said Michel, \"I should have to carry about a portable\ncrane! Well, my friends, let us be content with the moon for to-day.\nThere, at least, we shall cut a great figure! Later on we shall see if\nwe will go to the sun, where you can't drink without a crane to lift the\nglass to your mouth.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF DEVIATION.\n\n\nBarbicane had now no fear, if not about the issue of the journey, at\nleast about the projectile's force of impulsion. Its own speed would\ncarry it beyond the neutral line. Therefore it would not return to the\nearth nor remain motionless upon the point of attraction. One hypothesis\nonly remained to be realised, the arrival of the bullet at its goal\nunder the action of lunar attraction.\n\nIn reality it was a fall of 8,296 leagues upon a planet, it is true,\nwhere the gravity is six times less than upon the earth. Nevertheless it\nwould be a terrible fall, and one against which all precautions ought to\nbe taken without delay.\n\nThese precautions were of two sorts; some were for the purpose of\ndeadening the shock at the moment the projectile would touch lunar\nground; others were to retard the shock, and so make it less violent.\n\nIn order to deaden the shock, it was a pity that Barbicane was no longer\nable to employ the means that had so usefully weakened the shock at\ndeparture--that is to say, the water used as a spring and the movable\npartitions. The partitions still existed, but water was wanting, for\nthey could not use the reserve for this purpose--that would be precious\nin case the liquid element should fail on the lunar soil.\n\nBesides, this reserve would not have been sufficient for a spring. The\nlayer of water stored in the projectile at their departure, and on which\nlay the waterproof disc, occupied no less than three feet in depth, and\nspread over a surface of not less than fifty-four feet square. Now the\nreceptacles did not contain the fifth part of that. They were therefore\nobliged to give up this effectual means of deadening the shock.\n\nFortunately Barbicane, not content with employing water, had furnished\nthe movable disc with strong spring buffers, destined to lessen the\nshock against the bottom, after breaking the horizontal partitions.\nThese buffers were still in existence; they had only to be fitted on and\nthe movable disc put in its place. All these pieces, easy to handle, as\nthey weighed scarcely anything, could be rapidly mounted.\n\nThis was done. The different pieces were adjusted without difficulty. It\nwas only a matter of bolts and screws. There were plenty of tools. The\ndisc was soon fixed on its steel buffers like a table on its legs. One\ninconvenience resulted from this arrangement. The lower port-hole was\ncovered, and it would be impossible for the travellers to observe the\nmoon through that opening whilst they were being precipitated\nperpendicularly upon her. But they were obliged to give it up. Besides,\nthrough the lateral openings they could still perceive the vast lunar\nregions, like the earth is seen from the car of a balloon.\n\nThis placing of the disc took an hour's work. It was more than noon when\nthe preparations were completed. Barbicane made fresh observations on\nthe inclination of the projectile, but to his great vexation it had not\nturned sufficiently for a fall; it appeared to be describing a curve\nparallel with the lunar disc. The Queen of Night was shining splendidly\nin space, whilst opposite the orb of day was setting her on fire with\nhis rays.\n\nThis situation soon became an anxious one.\n\n\"Shall we get there?\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"We must act as though we should,\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"You are faint-hearted fellows,\" replied Michel Ardan. \"We shall get\nthere, and quicker than we want.\"\n\nThis answer recalled Barbicane to his preparations, and he occupied\nhimself with placing the contrivances destined to retard the fall.\n\nIt will be remembered that, at the meeting held in Tampa Town, Florida,\nCaptain Nicholl appeared as Barbicane's enemy, and Michel Ardan's\nadversary. When Captain Nicholl said that the projectile would be broken\nlike glass, Michel answered that he would retard the fall by means of\nfusees properly arranged.\n\nIn fact, powerful fusees, resting upon the bottom, and being fired\noutside, might, by producing a recoil action, lessen the speed of the\nbullet. These fusees were to burn in the void it is true, but oxygen\nwould not fail them, for they would furnish that themselves like the\nlunar volcanoes, the deflagration of which has never been prevented by\nthe want of atmosphere around the moon.\n\nBarbicane had therefore provided himself with fireworks shut up in\nlittle cannons of bored steel, which could be screwed on to the bottom\nof the projectile. Inside these cannons were level with the bottom;\noutside they went half a foot beyond it. There were twenty of them. An\nopening in the disc allowed them to light the match with which each was\nprovided. All the effect took place outside. The exploding mixture had\nbeen already rammed into each gun. All they had to do, therefore, was to\ntake up the metallic buffers fixed in the base, and to put these cannons\nin their place, where they fitted exactly.\n\nThis fresh work was ended about 3 p.m., and all precaution taken they\nhad now nothing to do but to wait.\n\nIn the meantime the projectile visibly drew nearer the moon. It was,\ntherefore, submitted in some proportion to its influence; but its own\nvelocity also inclined it in an oblique line. Perhaps the result of\nthese two influences would be a line that would become a tangent. But it\nwas certain that the projectile was not falling normally upon the\nsurface of the moon, for its base, by reason of its weight, ought to\nhave been turned towards her.\n\nBarbicane's anxiety was increased on seeing that his bullet resisted the\ninfluence of gravitation. It was the unknown that was before him--the\nunknown of the interstellar regions. He, the _savant_, believed that he\nhad foreseen the only three hypotheses that were possible--the return to\nthe earth, the fall upon the moon, or stagnation upon the neutral line!\nAnd here a fourth hypothesis, full of all the terrors of the infinite,\ncropped up inopportunely. To face it without flinching took a resolute\n_savant_ like Barbicane, a phlegmatic being like Nicholl, or an\naudacious adventurer like Michel Ardan.\n\nConversation was started on this subject. Other men would have\nconsidered the question from a practical point of view. They would have\nwondered where the projectile would take them to. Not they, however.\nThey sought the cause that had produced this effect.\n\n\"So we are off the line,\" said Michel. \"But how is that?\"\n\n\"I am very much afraid,\" answered Nicholl, \"that notwithstanding all the\nprecautions that were taken, the Columbiad was not aimed correctly. The\nslightest error would suffice to throw us outside the pale of lunar\nattraction.\"\n\n\"Then the cannon was pointed badly?\" said Michel.\n\n\"I do not think so,\" answered Barbicane. \"The cannon was rigorously\nperpendicular, and its direction towards the zenith of the place was\nincontestable. The moon passing the zenith, we ought to have reached her\nat the full. There is another reason, but it escapes me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we have arrived too late,\" suggested Nicholl.\n\n\"Too late?\" said Barbicane.\n\n\"Yes,\" resumed Nicholl. \"The notice from the Cambridge Observatory said\nthat the transit ought to be accomplished in ninety-seven hours thirteen\nminutes and twenty seconds. That means that before that time the moon\nwould not have reached the point indicated, and after she would have\npassed it.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" answered Barbicane. \"But we started on the 1st of December at\n11h. 13m. 25s. p.m., and we ought to arrive at midnight on the 5th,\nprecisely as the moon is full. Now this is the 5th of December. It is\nhalf-past three, and eight hours and a half ought to be sufficient to\ntake us to our goal. Why are we not going towards it?\"\n\n\"Perhaps the velocity was greater than it ought to have been,\" answered\nNicholl, \"for we know now that the initial velocity was greater than it\nwas supposed to be.\"\n\n\"No! a hundred times no!\" replied Barbicane. \"An excess of velocity,\nsupposing the direction of the projectile to have been correct, would\nnot have prevented us reaching the moon. No! There has been a deviation.\nWe have deviated!\"\n\n\"Through whom? through what?\" asked Nicholl.\n\n\"I cannot tell,\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"Well, Barbicane,\" then said Michel, \"should you like to know what I\nthink about why we have deviated?\"\n\n\"Say what you think.\"\n\n\"I would not give half a dollar to know! We have deviated, that is a\nfact. It does not matter much where we are going. We shall soon find\nout. As we are being carried along into space we shall end by falling\ninto some centre of attraction or another.\"\n\nBarbicane could not be contented with this indifference of Michel\nArdan's. Not that he was anxious about the future. But what he wanted to\nknow, at any price, was why his projectile had deviated.\n\nIn the meantime the projectile kept on its course sideways to the moon,\nand the objects thrown out along with it. Barbicane could even prove by\nthe landmarks upon the moon, which was only at 2,000 leagues' distance,\nthat its speed was becoming uniform--a fresh proof that they were not\nfalling. Its force of impulsion was prevailing over the lunar\nattraction, but the trajectory of the projectile was certainly taking\nthem nearer the lunar disc, and it might be hoped that at a nearer point\nthe weight would predominate and provoke a fall.\n\nThe three friends, having nothing better to do, went on with their\nobservations. They could not, however, yet determine the topography of\nthe satellite. Every relief was levelled under the action of the solar\nrays.\n\nThey watched thus through the lateral windows until 8 p.m. The moon then\nlooked so large that she hid half the firmament from them. The sun on\none side, and the Queen of Night on the other, inundated the projectile\nwith light.\n\nAt that moment Barbicane thought he could estimate at 700 leagues only\nthe distance that separated them from their goal. The velocity of the\nprojectile appeared to him to be 200 yards a second, or about 170\nleagues an hour. The base of the bullet had a tendency to turn towards\nthe moon under the influence of the centripetal force; but the\ncentrifugal force still predominated, and it became probable that the\nrectilinear trajectory would change to some curve the nature of which\ncould not be determined.\n\nBarbicane still sought the solution of his insoluble problem. The hours\nwent by without result. The projectile visibly drew nearer to the moon,\nbut it was plain that it would not reach her. The short distance at\nwhich it would pass her would be the result of two forces, attractive\nand repulsive, which acted upon the projectile.\n\n\"I only pray for one thing,\" repeated Michel, \"and that is to pass near\nenough to the moon to penetrate her secrets.\"\n\n\"Confound the cause that made our projectile deviate!\" cried Nicholl.\n\n\"Then,\" said Barbicane, as if he had been suddenly struck with an idea,\n\"confound that asteroid that crossed our path!\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said Michel Ardan.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" exclaimed Nicholl.\n\n\"I mean,\" resumed Barbicane, who appeared convinced, \"I mean that our\ndeviation is solely due to the influence of that wandering body.\"\n\n\"But it did not even graze us,\" continued Michel.\n\n\"What does that matter? Its bulk, compared with that of our projectile,\nwas enormous, and its attraction was sufficient to have an influence\nupon our direction.\"\n\n\"That influence must have been very slight,\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"Yes, Nicholl, but slight as it was,\" answered Barbicane, \"upon a\ndistance of 84,000 leagues it was enough to make us miss the moon!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nTHE OBSERVERS OF THE MOON.\n\n\nBarbicane had evidently found the only plausible reason for the\ndeviation. However slight it had been, it had been sufficient to modify\nthe trajectory of the projectile. It was a fatality. The audacious\nattempt had miscarried by a fortuitous circumstance, and unless anything\nunexpected happened, the lunar disc could no longer be reached. Would\nthey pass it near enough to resolve certain problems in physics and\ngeology until then unsolved? This was the only question that occupied\nthe minds of these bold travellers. As to the fate the future held in\nstore for them, they would not even think about it. Yet what was to\nbecome of them amidst these infinite solitudes when air failed them? A\nfew more days and they would fall suffocated in this bullet wandering at\nhazard. But a few days were centuries to these intrepid men, and they\nconsecrated every moment to observing the moon they no longer hoped to\nreach.\n\nThe distance which then separated the projectile from the satellite was\nestimated at about 200 leagues. Under these conditions, as far as\nregards the visibility of the details of the disc, the travellers were\nfarther from the moon than are the inhabitants of the earth with their\npowerful telescopes.\n\nIt is, in fact, known that the instrument set up by Lord Rosse at\nParsonstown, which magnifies 6,500 times, brings the moon to within\nsixteen leagues; and the powerful telescope set up at Long's Peak\nmagnifies 48,000 times, and brings the moon to within less than two\nleagues, so that objects twelve yards in diameter were sufficiently\ndistinct.\n\nThus, then, at that distance the topographical details of the moon, seen\nwithout a telescope, were not distinctly determined. The eye caught the\noutline of those vast depressions inappropriately called \"seas,\" but\nthey could not determine their nature. The prominence of the mountains\ndisappeared under the splendid irradiation produced by the reflection of\nthe solar rays. The eye, dazzled as if leaning over a furnace of molten\nsilver, turned from it involuntarily.\n\nHowever, the oblong form of the orb was already clearly seen.\n\nIt appeared like a gigantic egg, with the small end turned towards the\nearth. The moon, liquid and pliable in the first days of her formation,\nwas originally a perfect sphere. But soon, drawn within the pale of the\nearth's gravitation, she became elongated under its influence. By\nbecoming a satellite she lost her native purity of form; her centre of\ngravity was in advance of the centre of her figure, and from this fact\nsome _savants_ draw the conclusion that air and water might have taken\nrefuge on the opposite side of the moon, which is never seen from the\nearth.\n\nThis alteration in the primitive forms of the satellite was only visible\nfor a few moments. The distance between the projectile and the moon\ndiminished visibly; its velocity was considerably less than its initial\nvelocity, but eight or nine times greater than that of our express\ntrains. The oblique direction of the bullet, from its very obliquity,\nleft Michel Ardan some hope of touching the lunar disc at some point or\nother. He could not believe that he should not get to it. No, he could\nnot believe it, and this he often repeated. But Barbicane, who was a\nbetter judge, always answered him with pitiless logic.\n\n\"No, Michel, no. We can only reach the moon by a fall, and we are not\nfalling. The centripetal force keeps us under the moon's influence, but\nthe centrifugal force sends us irresistibly away from it.\"\n\nThis was said in a tone that deprived Michel Ardan of his last hopes.\n\nThe portion of the moon the projectile was approaching was the northern\nhemisphere. The selenographic maps make it the lower one, because they\nare generally drawn up according to the image given by the telescopes,\nand we know that they reverse the objects. Such was the _Mappa\nSelenographica_ of Boeer and Moedler which Barbicane consulted. This\nnorthern hemisphere presented vast plains, relieved by isolated\nmountains.\n\nAt midnight the moon was full. At that precise moment the travellers\nought to have set foot upon her if the unlucky asteroid had not made\nthem deviate from their direction. The orb was exactly in the condition\nrigorously determined by the Cambridge Observatory. She was\nmathematically at her perigee, and at the zenith of the twenty-eighth\nparallel. An observer placed at the bottom of the enormous Columbiad\nwhile it is pointed perpendicularly at the horizon would have framed the\nmoon in the mouth of the cannon. A straight line drawn through the axis\nof the piece would have passed through the centre of the moon.\n\nIt need hardly be stated that during the night between the 5th and 6th\nof December the travellers did not take a minute's rest. Could they have\nclosed their eyes so near to a new world? No. All their feelings were\nconcentrated in one thought--to see! Representatives of the earth, of\nhumanity past and present, all concentrated in themselves, it was\nthrough their eyes that the human race looked at these lunar regions and\npenetrated the secrets of its satellite! A strange emotion filled their\nhearts, and they went silently from one window to another.\n\nTheir observations were noted down by Barbicane, and were made\nrigorously exact. To make them they had telescopes. To control them they\nhad maps.\n\nThe first observer of the moon was Galileo. His poor telescope only\nmagnified thirty times. Nevertheless, in the spots that pitted the lunar\ndisc \"like eyes in a peacock's tail,\" he was the first to recognise\nmountains, and measure some heights to which he attributed,\nexaggerating, an elevation equal to the 20th of the diameter of the\ndisc, or 8,000 metres. Galileo drew up no map of his observations.\n\nA few years later an astronomer of Dantzig, Hevelius--by operations\nwhich were only exact twice a month, at the first and second\nquadrature--reduced Galileo's heights to one-twenty-sixth only of the\nlunar diameter. This was an exaggeration the other way. But it is to\nthis _savant_ that the first map of the moon is due. The light round\nspots there form circular mountains, and the dark spots indicate vast\nseas which, in reality, are plains. To these mountains and extents of\nsea he gave terrestrial denominations. There is a Sinai in the middle of\nan Arabia, Etna in the centre of Sicily, the Alps, Apennines,\nCarpathians, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, the Caspian, &c.--names\nbadly applied, for neither mountains nor seas recalled the configuration\nof their namesakes on the globe. That large white spot, joined on the\nsouth to vaster continents and terminated in a point, could hardly be\nrecognised as the inverted image of the Indian Peninsula, the Bay of\nBengal, and Cochin-China. So these names were not kept. Another\nchartographer, knowing human nature better, proposed a fresh\nnomenclature, which human vanity made haste to adopt.\n\nThis observer was Father Riccioli, a contemporary of Hevelius. He drew\nup a rough map full of errors. But he gave to the lunar mountains the\nnames of great men of antiquity and _savants_ of his own epoch.\n\nA third map of the moon was executed in the seventeenth century by\nDominique Cassini; superior to that of Riccioli in the execution, it is\ninexact in the measurements. Several smaller copies were published, but\nthe plate long kept in the _Imprimerie Nationale_ was sold by weight as\nold brass.\n\nLa Hire, a celebrated mathematician and designer, drew up a map of the\nmoon four and a half yards high, which was never engraved.\n\nAfter him, a German astronomer, Tobie Marger, about the middle of the\neighteenth century, began the publication of a magnificent selenographic\nmap, according to lunar measures, which he rigorously verified; but his\ndeath, which took place in 1762, prevented the termination of this\nbeautiful work.\n\nIt was in 1830 that Messrs. Boeer and Moedler composed their celebrated\n_Mappa Selenographica_, according to an orthographical projection. This\nmap reproduces the exact lunar disc, such as it appears, only the\nconfigurations of the mountains and plains are only correct in the\ncentral part; everywhere else--in the northern or southern portions,\neastern or western--the configurations foreshortened cannot be compared\nwith those of the centre. This topographical map, one yard high and\ndivided into four parts, is a masterpiece of lunar chartography.\n\nAfter these _savants_ may be cited the selenographic reliefs of the\nGerman astronomer Julius Schmidt, the topographical works of Father\nSecchi, the magnificent sheets of the English amateur, Waren de la Rue,\nand lastly a map on orthographical projection of Messrs. Lecouturier and\nChapuis, a fine model set up in 1860, of very correct design and clear\noutlines.\n\nSuch is the nomenclature of the different maps relating to the lunar\nworld. Barbicane possessed two, that of Messrs. Boeer and Moedler and\nthat of Messrs. Chapuis and Lecouturier. They were to make his work of\nobserver easier.\n\nThey had excellent marine glasses specially constructed for this\njourney. They magnified objects a hundred times; they would therefore\nhave reduced the distance between the earth and the moon to less than\n1,000 leagues. But then at a distance which towards 3 a.m. did not\nexceed a hundred miles, and in a medium which no atmosphere obstructed,\nthese instruments brought the lunar level to less than fifteen hundred\nmetres.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nIMAGINATION AND REALITY.\n\n\n\"Have you ever seen the moon?\" a professor asked one of his pupils\nironically.\n\n\"No, sir,\" answered the pupil more ironically still, \"but I have heard\nit spoken of.\"\n\nIn one sense the jocose answer of the pupil might have been made by the\nimmense majority of sublunary beings. How many people there are who have\nheard the moon spoken of and have never seen it--at least through a\ntelescope! How many even have never examined the map of their satellite!\n\nLooking at a comprehensive selenographic map, one peculiarity strikes us\nat once. In contrast to the geographical arrangements of the earth and\nMars, the continents occupy the more southern hemisphere of the lunar\nglobe. These continents have not such clear and regular boundary-lines\nas those of South America, Africa, and the Indian Peninsula. Their\nangular, capricious, and deeply-indented coasts are rich in gulfs and\npeninsulas. They recall the confusion in the islands of the Sound, where\nthe earth is excessively cut up. If navigation has ever existed upon the\nsurface of the moon it must have been exceedingly difficult and\ndangerous, and the Selenite mariners and hydrographers were greatly to\nbe pitied, the former when they came upon these perilous coasts, the\nlatter when they were marine surveying on the stormy banks.\n\nIt may also be noticed that upon the lunar spheroid the South Pole is\nmuch more continental than the North Pole. On the latter there is only a\nslight strip of land capping it, separated from the other continents by\nvast seas. (When the word \"seas\" is used the vast plains probably\ncovered by the sea formerly must be understood.) On the south the land\ncovers nearly the whole hemisphere. It is, therefore, possible that the\nSelenites have already planted their flag on one of their poles, whilst\nFranklin, Ross, Kane, Dumont d'Urville, and Lambert have been unable to\nreach this unknown point on the terrestrial globe.\n\nIslands are numerous on the surface of the moon. They are almost all\noblong or circular, as though traced with a compass, and seem to form a\nvast archipelago, like that charming group lying between Greece and Asia\nMinor which mythology formerly animated with its most graceful legends.\nInvoluntarily the names of Naxos, Tenedos, Milo, and Carpathos come into\nthe mind, and you seek the ship of Ulysses or the \"clipper\" of the\nArgonauts. That was what it appeared to Michel Ardan; it was a Grecian\nArchipelago that he saw on the map. In the eyes of his less imaginative\ncompanions the aspect of these shores recalled rather the cut-up lands\nof New Brunswick and Nova Scotia; and where the Frenchman looked for\ntraces of the heroes of fable, these Americans were noting favourable\npoints for the establishment of mercantile houses in the interest of\nlunar commerce and industry.\n\nSome remarks on the orographical disposition of the moon must conclude\nthe description of its continents, chains of mountains, isolated\nmountains, amphitheatres, and watercourses. The moon is like an immense\nSwitzerland--a continual Norway, where Plutonic influence has done\neverything. This surface, so profoundly rugged, is the result of the\nsuccessive contractions of the crust while the orb was being formed. The\nlunar disc is propitious for the study of great geological phenomena.\nAccording to the remarks of some astronomers, its surface, although more\nancient than the surface of the earth, has remained newer. There there\nis no water to deteriorate the primitive relief, the continuous action\nof which produces a sort of general levelling. No air, the decomposing\ninfluence of which modifies orographical profiles. There Pluto's work,\nunaltered by Neptune's, is in all its native purity. It is the earth as\nshe was before tides and currents covered her with layers of soil.\n\nAfter having wandered over these vast continents the eye is attracted by\nstill vaster seas. Not only does their formation, situation, and aspect\nrecall the terrestrial oceans, but, as upon earth, these seas occupy the\nlargest part of the globe. And yet these are not liquid tracts, but\nplains, the nature of which the travellers hoped soon to determine.\n\nAstronomers, it must be owned, have decorated these pretended seas with\nat least odd names which science has respected at present. Michel Ardan\nwas right when he compared this map to a \"map of tenderness,\" drawn up\nby Scudery or Cyrano de Bergerac.\n\n\"Only,\" added he, \"it is no longer the map of sentiment like that of the\n18th century; it is the map of life, clearly divided into two parts, the\none feminine, the other masculine. To the women, the right hemisphere;\nto the men, the left!\"\n\nWhen he spoke thus Michel made his prosaic companions shrug their\nshoulders. Barbicane and Nicholl looked at the lunar map from another\npoint of view to that of their imaginative friend. However, their\nimaginative friend had some reason on his side. Judge if he had not.\n\nIn the left hemisphere stretches the \"Sea of Clouds,\" where human reason\nis so often drowned. Not far off appears the \"Sea of Rains,\" fed by all\nthe worries of existence. Near lies the \"Sea of Tempests,\" where man\nstruggles incessantly against his too-often victorious passions. Then,\nexhausted by deceptions, treasons, infidelities, and all the procession\nof terrestrial miseries, what does he find at the end of his career? The\nvast \"Sea of Humours,\" scarcely softened by some drops from the waters\nof the \"Gulf of Dew!\" Clouds, rain, tempests, humours, does the life of\nman contain aught but these? and is it not summed up in these four\nwords?\n\nThe right-hand hemisphere dedicated to \"the women\" contains smaller\nseas, the significant names of which agree with every incident of\nfeminine existence. There is the \"Sea of Serenity,\" over which bends the\nyoung maiden, and the \"Lake of Dreams,\" which reflects her back a happy\nfuture. The \"Sea of Nectar,\" with its waves of tenderness and breezes of\nlove! The \"Sea of Fecundity,\" the \"Sea of Crises,\" and the \"Sea of\nVapours,\" the dimensions of which are, perhaps, too restricted, and\nlastly, that vast \"Sea of Tranquillity\" where all false passions, all\nuseless dreams, all unassuaged desires are absorbed, and the waves of\nwhich flow peacefully into the \"Lake of Death!\"\n\nWhat a strange succession of names! What a singular division of these\ntwo hemispheres of the moon, united to one another like man and woman,\nand forming a sphere of life, carried through space. And was not the\nimaginative Michel right in thus interpreting the fancies of the old\nastronomers?\n\nBut whilst his imagination thus ran riot on the \"seas,\" his grave\ncompanions were looking at things more geographically. They were\nlearning this new world by heart. They were measuring its angles and\ndiameters.\n\nTo Barbicane and Nicholl the \"Sea of Clouds\" was an immense depression\nof ground, with circular mountains scattered about on it; covering a\ngreat part of the western side of the southern hemisphere, it covered\n184,800 square leagues, and its centre was in south latitude 15\u00b0, and\nwest longitude 20\u00b0. The Ocean of Tempests, _Oceanus Procellarum_, the\nlargest plain on the lunar disc, covered a surface of 328,300 square\nleagues, its centre being in north latitude 10\u00b0, and east longitude 45\u00b0.\nFrom its bosom emerge the admirable shining mountains of Kepler and\nAristarchus.\n\nMore to the north, and separated from the Sea of Clouds by high chains\nof mountains, extends the Sea of Rains, _Mare Imbrium_, having its\ncentral point in north latitude 35\u00b0 and east longitude 20\u00b0; it is of a\nnearly circular form, and covers a space of 193,000 leagues. Not far\ndistant the Sea of Humours, _Mare Humorum_, a little basin of 44,200\nsquare leagues only, was situated in south latitude 25\u00b0, and east\nlongitude 40\u00b0. Lastly, three gulfs lie on the coast of this\nhemisphere--the Torrid Gulf, the Gulf of Dew, and the Gulf of Iris,\nlittle plains inclosed by high chains of mountains.\n\nThe \"Feminine\" hemisphere, naturally more capricious, was distinguished\nby smaller and more numerous seas. These were, towards the north, the\n_Mare Frigoris_, in north latitude 55\u00b0 and longitude 0\u00b0, with 76,000\nsquare leagues of surface, which joined the Lake of Death and Lake of\nDreams; the Sea of Serenity, _Mare Serenitatis_, by north latitude 25\u00b0\nand west longitude 20\u00b0, comprising a surface of 80,000 square leagues;\nthe Sea of Crises, _Mare Crisium_, round and very compact, in north\nlatitude 17\u00b0 and west longitude 55\u00b0, a surface of 40,000 square leagues,\na veritable Caspian buried in a girdle of mountains. Then on the\nequator, in north latitude 5\u00b0 and west longitude 25\u00b0, appeared the Sea\nof Tranquillity, _Mare Tranquillitatis_, occupying 121,509 square\nleagues of surface; this sea communicated on the south with the Sea of\nNectar, _Mare Nectaris_, an extent of 28,800 square leagues, in south\nlatitude 15\u00b0 and west longitude 35\u00b0, and on the east with the Sea of\nFecundity, _Mare Fecunditatis_, the vastest in this hemisphere,\noccupying 219,300 square leagues, in south latitude 3\u00b0 and west\nlongitude 50\u00b0. Lastly, quite to the north and quite to the south lie two\nmore seas, the Sea of Humboldt, _Mare Humboldtianum_, with a surface of\n6,500 square leagues, and the Southern Sea, _Mare Australe_, with a\nsurface of 26,000.\n\nIn the centre of the lunar disc, across the equator and on the zero\nmeridian, lies the centre gulf, _Sinus Medii_, a sort of hyphen between\nthe two hemispheres.\n\nThus appeared to the eyes of Nicholl and Barbicane the surface always\nvisible of the earth's satellite. When they added up these different\nfigures they found that the surface of this hemisphere measured\n4,738,160 square leagues, 3,317,600 of which go for volcanoes, chains of\nmountains, amphitheatres, islands--in a word, all that seems to form the\nsolid portion of the globe--and 1,410,400 leagues for the seas, lake,\nmarshes, and all that seems to form the liquid portion, all of which was\nperfectly indifferent to the worthy Michel.\n\nIt will be noticed that this hemisphere is thirteen and a-half times\nsmaller than the terrestrial hemisphere. And yet upon it selenographers\nhave already counted 50,000 craters. It is a rugged surface worthy of\nthe unpoetical qualification of \"green cheese\" which the English have\ngiven it.\n\nWhen Barbicane pronounced this disobliging name Michel Ardan gave a\nbound.\n\n\"That is how the Anglo-Saxons of the 19th century treat the beautiful\nDiana, the blonde Phoebe, the amiable Isis, the charming Astarte, the\nQueen of Night, the daughter of Latona and Jupiter, the younger sister\nof the radiant Apollo!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nOROGRAPHICAL DETAILS.\n\n\nIt has already been pointed out that the direction followed by the\nprojectile was taking us towards the northern hemisphere of the moon.\nThe travellers were far from that central point which they ought to have\ntouched if their trajectory had not suffered an irremediable deviation.\n\nIt was half-past twelve at night. Barbicane then estimated his distance\nat 1,400 kilometres, a distance rather greater than the length of the\nlunar radius, and which must diminish as he drew nearer the North Pole.\nThe projectile was then not at the altitude of the equator, but on the\ntenth parallel, and from that latitude carefully observed on the map as\nfar as the Pole, Barbicane and his two companions were able to watch the\nmoon under the most favourable circumstances.\n\nIn fact, by using telescopes, this distance of 1,400 kilometres was\nreduced to fourteen miles, or four and a-half leagues. The telescope of\nthe Rocky Mountains brought the moon still nearer, but the terrestrial\natmosphere singularly lessened its optical power. Thus Barbicane, in his\nprojectile, by looking through his glass, could already perceive certain\ndetails almost imperceptible to observers on the earth.\n\n\"My friends,\" then said the president in a grave voice, \"I do not know\nwhere we are going, nor whether we shall ever see the terrestrial globe\nagain. Nevertheless, let us do our work as if one day it would be of use\nto our fellow-creatures. Let us keep our minds free from all\npreoccupation. We are astronomers. This bullet is the Cambridge\nObservatory transported into space. Let us make our observations.\"\n\nThat said, the work was begun with extreme precision, and it faithfully\nreproduced the different aspects of the moon at the variable distances\nwhich the projectile reached in relation to that orb.\n\nWhilst the bullet was at the altitude of the 10th north parallel it\nseemed to follow the 20th degree of east longitude.\n\nHere may be placed an important remark on the subject of the map which\nthey used for their observations. In the selenographic maps, where, on\naccount of the reversal of objects by the telescope, the south is at the\ntop and the north at the bottom, it seems natural that the east should\nbe on the left and the west on the right. However, it is not so. If the\nmap were turned upside down, and showed the moon as she appears, the\neast would be left and the west right, the inverse of the terrestrial\nmaps. The reason of this anomaly is the following:--Observers situated\nin the northern hemisphere--in Europe, for example--perceive the moon in\nthe south from them. When they look at her they turn their backs to the\nnorth, the opposite position they take when looking at a terrestrial\nmap. Their backs being turned to the north, they have the east to the\nleft and the west to the right. For observers in the southern\nhemisphere--in Patagonia, for example--the west of the moon would be on\ntheir left and the east on their right, for the south would be behind\nthem.\n\nSuch is the reason for the apparent reversal of these two cardinal\npoints, and this must be remembered whilst following the observations of\nPresident Barbicane.\n\nHelped by the _Mappa Selenographica_ of Boeer and Moedler, the\ntravellers could, without hesitating, survey that portion of the disc in\nthe field of their telescopes.\n\n\"What are we looking at now?\" asked Michel.\n\n\"At the northern portion of the Sea of Clouds,\" answered Barbicane. \"We\nare too far off to make out its nature. Are those plains composed of\ndry sand, as the first astronomers believed? Or are they only immense\nforests, according to the opinion of Mr. Waren de la Rue, who grants a\nvery low but very dense atmosphere to the moon? We shall find that out\nlater on. We will affirm nothing till we are quite certain.\"\n\n\"This Sea of Clouds is rather doubtfully traced upon the maps. It is\nsupposed that this vast plain is strewn with blocks of lava vomited by\nthe neighbouring volcanoes on its right side, Ptolemy, Purbach, and\nArzachel. The projectile was drawing sensibly nearer, and the summits\nwhich close in this sea on the north were distinctly visible. In front\nrose a mountain shining gloriously, the top of which seemed drowned in\nthe solar rays.\"\n\n\"That mountain is--?\" asked Michel.\n\n\"Copernicus,\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"Let us have a look at Copernicus,\" said Michel.\n\nThis mountain, situated in north latitude 9\u00b0, and east longitude 20\u00b0,\nrises to a height of nearly 11,000 feet above the surface of the moon.\nIt is quite visible from the earth, and astronomers can study it with\nease, especially during the phase between the last quarter and the new\nmoon, because then shadows are thrown lengthways from east to west, and\nallow the altitudes to be taken.\n\nCopernicus forms the most important radiating system in the southern\nhemisphere, according to Tycho Brahe. It rises isolated like a gigantic\nlighthouse over that of the Sea of Clouds bordering on the Sea of\nTempests, and it lights two oceans at once with its splendid rays. Those\nlong luminous trails, so dazzling at full moon, made a spectacle without\nan equal; they pass the boundary chains on the north, and stretch as far\nas the Sea of Rains. At 1 a.m., terrestrial time, the projectile, like a\nballoon carried into space, hung over this superb mountain.\n\nBarbicane could perfectly distinguish its chief features. Copernicus is\ncomprehended in the series of annular mountains of the first order in\nthe division of the large amphitheatres. Like the mountains of Kepler\nand Aristarchus, which overlook the Ocean of Tempests, it appears\nsometimes like a brilliant point through the pale light, and used to be\ntaken for a volcano in activity. But it is only an extinct volcano, like\nthose on that side of the moon. Its circumference presented a diameter\nof about twenty-two leagues. The glasses showed traces of\nstratifications in it produced by successive eruptions, and its\nneighbourhood appeared strewn with volcanic remains, which were still\nseen in the crater.\n\n\"There exist,\" said Barbicane, \"several sorts of amphitheatres an the\nsurface of the moon, and it is easy to see that Copernicus belongs to\nthe radiating class. If we were nearer it we should perceive the cones\nwhich bristle in the interior, and which were formerly so many fiery\nmouths. A curious arrangement, and one without exception on the lunar\ndisc, is presented on the interior surface of these amphitheatres, being\nnotably downward from the exterior plane, a contrary form to that which\nterrestrial craters present. It follows, therefore, that the general\ncurvature at the bottom of these amphitheatres gives us fear of an\ninferior diameter to that of the moon.\"\n\n\"What is the reason of this special arrangement?\" asked Nicholl.\n\n\"It is not known,\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"How splendidly it shines!\" said Michel. \"I think it would be difficult\nto see a more beautiful spectacle!\"\n\n\"What should you say, then,\" answered Barbicane, \"if the chances of our\njourney should take us towards the southern hemisphere?\"\n\n\"Well, I should say it is finer still,\" replied Michel Ardan.\n\nAt that moment the projectile hung right over the amphitheatre. The\ncircumference of Copernicus formed an almost perfect circle, and its\nsteep ramparts were clearly defined. A second circular inclosure could\neven be distinguished. A grey plain of wild aspect spread around on\nwhich every relief appeared yellow. At the bottom of the amphitheatre,\nas if in a jewel-case, sparkled for one instant two or three eruptive\ncones like enormous dazzling gems. Towards the north the sides of the\ncrater were lowered into a depression which would probably have given\naccess to the interior of the crater.\n\nAs they passed above the surrounding plain Barbicane was able to note a\nlarge number of mountains of slight importance, amongst others a little\ncircular mountain called \"Gay-Lussac,\" more than twenty-three kilometres\nwide. Towards the south the plain was very flat, without one elevation\nor projection of the soil. Towards the north, on the contrary, as far as\nthe place where it borders on the Ocean of Tempests, it was like a\nliquid surface agitated by a storm, of which the hills and hollows\nformed a succession of waves suddenly coagulated. Over the whole of\nthis, and in all directions, ran the luminous trails which converged to\nthe summit of Copernicus. Some had a width of thirty kilometres over a\nlength that could not be estimated.\n\nThe travellers discussed the origin of these strange rays, but they\ncould not determine their nature any better than terrestrial observers.\n\n\"Why,\" said Nicholl, \"may not these rays be simply the spurs of the\nmountains reflecting the light of the sun more vividly?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Barbicane, \"if it were so in certain conditions of the\nmoon they would throw shadows, which they do not.\"\n\nIn fact, these rays only appear when the sun is in opposition with the\nmoon, and they disappear as soon as its rays become oblique.\n\n\"But what explanation of these trails of light have been imagined?\"\nasked Michel, \"for I cannot believe that _savants_ would ever stop short\nfor want of explanation.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Barbicane, \"Herschel has uttered an opinion, but he does\nnot affirm it.\"\n\n\"Never mind; what is his opinion?\"\n\n\"He thought that these rays must be streams of cold lava which shone\nwhen the sun struck them normally.\"\n\n\"That may be true, but nothing is less certain. However, if we pass\nnearer to Tycho we shall be in a better position to find out the cause\nof this radiation.\"\n\n\"What do you think that plain is like, seen from the height we are at?\"\nasked Michel.\n\n\"I don't know,\" answered Nicholl.\n\n\"Well, with all these pieces of lava, sharpened like spindles, it looks\nlike 'an immense game of spilikins,' thrown down pell-mell. We only want\na hook to draw them up.\"\n\n\"Be serious for once in your life,\" said Barbicane.\n\n\"I will be serious,\" replied Michel tranquilly, \"and instead of\nspilikins let us say they are bones. This plain would then be only an\nimmense cemetery upon which would repose the immortal remains of a\nthousand distinct generations. Do you like that comparison better?\"\n\n\"One is as good as the other,\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"The devil! You are difficult to please,\" replied Michel.\n\n\"My worthy friend,\" resumed the prosaic Barbicane, \"it does not matter\nwhat it looks like when we don't know what it is.\"\n\n\"A good answer,\" exclaimed Michel; \"that will teach me to argue with\n_savants_.\"\n\nIn the meantime the projectile went with almost uniform speed round the\nlunar disc. It may be easily imagined that the travellers did not dream\nof taking a minute's rest. A fresh landscape lay before their eyes every\ninstant. About half-past one in the morning they caught a glimpse of the\nsummit of another mountain. Barbicane consulted his map, and recognised\nEratosthenes.\n\nIt was a circular mountain 4,500 metres high, one of those amphitheatres\nso numerous upon the satellite. Barbicane informed his friends of\nKepler's singular opinion upon the formation of these circles.\nAccording to the celebrated mathematician, these crateriform cavities\nhad been dug out by the hand of man.\n\n\"What for?\" asked Nicholl.\n\n\"In order to preserve themselves from the ardour of the solar rays,\nwhich strike the moon during fifteen consecutive days.\"\n\n\"The Selenites were not fools!\" said Michel.\n\n\"It was a singular idea!\" answered Nicholl. \"But it is probable that\nKepler did not know the real dimensions of these circles, for digging\nthem would have been giants' labour, impracticable for Selenites.\"\n\n\"Why so, if the weight on the surface of the moon is six times less than\nupon the surface of the earth?\" said Michel.\n\n\"But if the Selenites are six times smaller?\" replied Nicholl.\n\n\"And if there are no Selenites?\" added Barbicane, which terminated the\ndiscussion.\n\nEratosthenes soon disappeared from the horizon without the projectile\nhaving been sufficiently near it to allow a rigorous observation. This\nmountain separated the Apennines from the Carpathians.\n\nIn lunar orography, several chains of mountains have been distinguished\nwhich are principally distributed over the northern hemisphere. Some,\nhowever, occupy certain portions of the southern hemisphere.\n\nThe following is a list of these different chains, with their latitudes\nand the height of their highest summits:--\n\n                        deg.   deg.       metres.\n    Mounts Doerfel       84 to  0 S. lat.  7,603\n      \"    Leibnitz      65 \"   0   \"      7,600\n      \"    Rook          20 \"  30   \"      1,600\n      \"    Altai         17 \"  28   \"      4,047\n      \"    Cordilleras   10 \"  20   \"      3,898\n      \"    Pyrenees       8 \"  18   \"      3,631\n      \"    Oural          5 \"  13   \"        838\n      \"    Alembert       4 \"  10   \"      5,847\n      \"    Hoemus         8 \"  21 N. lat.  2,021\n      \"    Carpathians   15 \"  19   \"      1,939\n      \"    Apennines     14 \"  27   \"      5,501\n      \"    Taurus        21 \"  28   \"      2,746\n      \"    Riphees       25 \"  33   \"      4,171\n      \"    Hercynians    17 \"  29   \"      1,170\n      \"    Caucasia      32 \"  41   \"      5,567\n      \"    Alps          42 \"  49   \"      3,617\n\nThe most important of these different chains is that of the Apennines,\nthe development of which extends 150 leagues, and is yet inferior to\nthat of the great orographical movements of the earth. The Apennines run\nalong the eastern border of the Sea of Rains, and are continued on the\nnorth by the Carpathians, the profile of which measures about 100\nleagues.\n\nThe travellers could only catch a glimpse of the summit of these\nApennines which lie between west long. 10\u00b0 and east long. 16\u00b0; but the\nchain of the Carpathians was visible from 18\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 east long., and\nthey could see how they were distributed.\n\nOne hypothesis seemed to them very justifiable. Seeing that this chain\nof the Carpathians was here and there circular in form and with high\npeaks, they concluded that it anciently formed important amphitheatres.\nThese mountainous circles must have been broken up by the vast cataclysm\nto which the Sea of Rains was due. These Carpathians looked then what\nthe amphitheatres of Purbach, Arzachel, and Ptolemy would if some\ncataclysm were to throw down their left ramparts and transform them into\ncontinuous chains. They present an average height of 3,200 metres, a\nheight comparable to certain of the Pyrenees. Their southern slopes fall\nstraight into the immense Sea of Rains.\n\nAbout 2 a.m. Barbicane was at the altitude of the 20th lunar parallel,\nnot far from that little mountain, 1,559 metres high, which bears the\nname of Pythias. The distance from the projectile to the moon was only\n1,200 kilometres, brought by means of telescopes to two and a half\nleagues.\n\nThe \"Mare Imbrium\" lay before the eyes of the travellers like an immense\ndepression of which the details were not very distinct. Near them on the\nleft rose Mount Lambert, the altitude of which is estimated at 1,813\nmetres, and farther on, upon the borders of the Ocean of Tempests, in\nnorth lat. 23\u00b0 and east long. 29\u00b0, rose the shining mountain of Euler.\nThis mountain, which rises only 1,815 metres above the lunar surface,\nhas been the object of an interesting work by the astronomer Schroeter.\nThis _savant_, trying to find out the origin of the lunar mountains,\nasked himself whether the volume of the crater always looked equal to\nthe volume of the ramparts that formed it. Now this he found to be\ngenerally the case, and he hence concluded that a single eruption of\nvolcanic matter had sufficed to form these ramparts, for successive\neruptions would have destroyed the connection. Mount Euler alone was an\nexception to this general law, and it must have taken several successive\neruptions to form it, for the volume of its cavity is double that of its\ninclosure.\n\nAll these hypotheses were allowable to terrestrial observers whose\ninstruments were incomplete; but Barbicane was no longer contented to\naccept them, and seeing that his projectile drew regularly nearer the\nlunar disc he did not despair of ultimately reaching it, or at least of\nfinding out the secrets of its formation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nLUNAR LANDSCAPES.\n\n\nAt half-past two in the morning the bullet was over the 30th lunar\nparallel at an effective distance of 1,000 kilometres, reduced by the\noptical instruments to ten. It still seemed impossible that it could\nreach any point on the disc. Its movement of translation, relatively\nslow, was inexplicable to President Barbicane. At that distance from the\nmoon it ought to have been fast in order to maintain it against the\npower of attraction. The reason of that phenomenon was also\ninexplicable; besides, time was wanting to seek for the cause. The\nreliefs on the lunar surface flew beneath their eyes, and they did not\nwant to lose a single detail.\n\nThe disc appeared through the telescopes at a distance of two and a half\nleagues. If an a\u00ebronaut were taken up that distance from the earth, what\nwould he distinguish upon its surface? No one can tell, as the highest\nascensions have not exceeded 8,000 metres.\n\nThe following, however, is an exact description of what Barbicane and\nhis companions saw from that height:--\n\nLarge patches of different colours appeared on the disc. Selenographers\ndo not agree about their nature. They are quite distinct from each\nother. Julius Schmidt is of opinion that if the terrestrial oceans were\ndried up, a Selenite observer could only tell the difference between the\nterrestrial oceans and continental plains by patches of colour as\ndistinctly varied as those which a terrestrial observer sees upon the\nmoon. According to him, the colour common to the vast plains, known\nunder the name of \"seas,\" is dark grey, intermingled with green and\nbrown. Some of the large craters are coloured in the same way.\n\nBarbicane knew this opinion of the German selenographer; it is shared by\nMessrs. Boeer and Moedler. He noticed that they were right, whilst\ncertain astronomers, who only allow grey colouring on the surface of the\nmoon, are wrong. In certain places the green colour was very vivid;\naccording to Julius Schmidt, it is so in the Seas of Serenity and\nHumours. Barbicane likewise remarked the wide craters with no interior\ncones, which are of a bluish colour, analogous to that of fresh-polished\nsheets of steel. These colours really belonged to the lunar disc, and\ndid not result, as certain astronomers think, either from some\nimperfection in the object-glasses of the telescopes or the\ninterposition of the terrestrial atmosphere. Barbicane had no longer any\ndoubt about it. He was looking at it through the void, and could not\ncommit any optical error. He considered that the existence of this\ndifferent colouring was proved to science. Now were the green shades\nowing to tropical vegetation, kept up by a low and dense atmosphere? He\ncould not yet be certain.\n\nFarther on he noticed a reddish tinge, quite sufficiently distinct. A\nsimilar colour had already been observed upon the bottom of an isolated\ninclosure, known under the name of the Lichtenberg Amphitheatre, which\nis situated near the Hercynian Mountains, on the border of the moon. But\nhe could not make out its nature.\n\nHe was not more fortunate about another peculiarity of the disc, for he\ncould not find out its cause. The peculiarity was the following one:--\n\nMichel Ardan was watching near the president when he remarked some long\nwhite lines brilliantly lighted up by the direct rays of the sun. It was\na succession of luminous furrows, very different from the radiation that\nCopernicus had presented. They ran in parallel lines.\n\nMichel, with his usual readiness, exclaimed--\n\n\"Why, there are cultivated fields!\"\n\n\"Cultivated fields!\" repeated Nicholl, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n\"Ploughed fields, at all events,\" replied Michel Ardan. \"But what\nploughmen these Selenites must be, and what gigantic oxen they must\nharness to their ploughs, to make such furrows!\"\n\n\"They are not furrows, they are crevices!\"\n\n\"Crevices let them be,\" answered Michel with docility. \"Only what do you\nmean by crevices in the world of science?\" Barbicane soon told his\ncompanions all he knew about lunar crevices. He knew that they were\nfurrows observed upon all the non-mountainous parts of the lunar disc;\nthat these furrows, generally isolated, were from four to five leagues\nonly; that their width varies from 1,000 to 1,500 metres, and their\nedges are rigorously parallel. But he knew nothing more about their\nformation or their nature.\n\nBarbicane watched these furrows through his telescope very attentively.\nHe noticed that their banks were exceedingly steep. They were long\nparallel ramparts; with a little imagination they might be taken for\nlong lines of fortifications raised by Selenite engineers.\n\nSome of these furrows were as straight as if they had been cut by line,\nothers were slightly curved through with edges still parallel. Some\ncrossed each other. Some crossed craters. Some furrowed the circular\ncavities, such as Posidonius or Petavius. Some crossed the seas, notably\nthe Sea of Serenity.\n\nThese accidents of Nature had naturally exercised the imagination of\nterrestrial astronomers. The earliest observations did not discover\nthese furrows. Neither Hevelius, Cassini, La Hire, nor Herschel seems to\nhave known them. It was Schroeter who in 1789 first attracted the\nattention of _savants_ to them. Others followed who studied them, such\nas Pastorff, Gruithuysen, Boeer, and Moedler. At present there are\nseventy-six; but though they have been counted, their nature has not yet\nbeen determined. They are not fortifications certainly, anymore than\nthey are beds of dried-up rivers, for water so light on the surface of\nthe moon could not have dug such ditches, and there furrows often cross\ncraters at a great elevation.\n\nIt must, however, be acknowledged that Michel Ardan had an idea, and\nthat, without knowing it, he shared it with Julius Schmidt.\n\n\"Why,\" said he, \"may not these inexplicable appearances be simply\nphenomena of vegetation?\"\n\n\"In what way do you mean?\" asked Barbicane.\n\n\"Now do not be angry, worthy president,\" answered Michel, \"but may not\nthese black lines be regular rows of trees?\"\n\n\"Do you want to find some vegetation?\" said Barbicane.\n\n\"I want to explain what you scientific men do not explain! My hypothesis\nwill at least explain why these furrows disappear, or seem to disappear,\nat regular epochs.\"\n\n\"Why should they?\"\n\n\"Because trees might become invisible when they lose their leaves, and\nvisible when they grow again.\"\n\n\"Your explanation is ingenious, old fellow,\" answered Barbicane, \"but it\ncannot be admitted.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because it cannot be said to be any season on the surface of the moon,\nand, consequently, the phenomena of vegetation on the surface of the\nmoon cannot be produced.\"\n\nIn fact, the slight obliquity of the lunar axis keeps the sun there at\nan almost equal altitude under every latitude. Above the equatorial\nregions the radiant orb almost invariably occupies the zenith, and\nhardly passes the limit of the horizon in the polar regions. Therefore,\nin each region, according to its position, there reigns perpetual\nspring, summer, autumn, or winter, as in the planet Jupiter, whose axis\nis also slightly inclined upon its orbit.\n\nThe origin of these furrows is a difficult question to solve. They are\ncertainly posterior to the formation of the craters and amphitheatres,\nfor several have crossed them, and broken their circular ramparts. It\nmay be that they are contemporary with the latest geographical epochs,\nand are only owing to the expansion of natural forces.\n\nIn the meantime the projectile had reached the altitude of the 40th\ndegree of lunar latitude at a distance that could not be greater than\n800 kilometres. Objects appeared through the telescopes at two leagues\nonly. At this point rose under their feet the Helicon, 505 metres high,\nand on the left were the mediocre heights, which inclose a small portion\nof the Sea of Rains under the name of the Gulf of Iris.\n\nThe terrestrial atmosphere ought to be 170 times more transparent than\nit is in order to allow astronomers to make complete observations on the\nsurface of the moon. But in the void the projectile was moving in no\nfluid lay between the eye of the observer and the object observed. What\nis more, Barbicane was at a less distance than the most powerful\ntelescopes, even that of Lord Rosse or the one on the Rocky Mountains,\ncould give. It was, therefore, in circumstances highly favourable for\nsolving the great question of the habitability of the moon. Yet the\nsolution of this question escaped him still. He could only distinguish\nthe deserted beds of the immense plains, and, towards the north, arid\nmountains. No labour betrayed the hand of man. No ruin indicated his\npassage. No agglomeration of animals indicated that life was developed\nthere, even in an inferior degree. There was no movement anywhere, no\nappearance of vegetation anywhere. Of the three kingdoms represented on\nthe terrestrial globe, one only was represented on that of the\nmoon--viz., the mineral kingdom.\n\n\"So,\" said Michel Ardan, looking rather put out, \"there is nobody after\nall.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Nicholl; \"we have seen neither man, animal, nor tree as\nyet. After all, if the atmosphere has taken refuge at the bottom of\ncavities, in the interior of the amphitheatres, or even on the opposite\nface of the moon, we cannot decide the question.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" added Barbicane, \"even for the most piercing sight a man is\nnot visible at a distance of more than four miles. Therefore if there\nare any Selenites they can see our projectile, but we cannot see them.\"\n\nAbout 11 a.m., at the altitude of the 50th parallel, the distance was\nreduced to 300 miles. On the left rose the capricious outlines of a\nchain of mountains, outlined in full light. Towards the right, on the\ncontrary, was a large black hole like a vast dark and bottomless well\nbored in the lunar soil.\n\nThat hole was the Black Lake, or Pluto, a deep circle from which the\nearth could be conveniently studied between the last quarter and the new\nmoon, when the shadows are thrown from west to east.\n\nThis black colour is rarely met with on the surface of the satellite. It\nhas, as yet, only been seen in the depths of the circle of Endymion, to\nthe east of the Cold Sea, in the northern hemisphere, and at the bottom\nof the circle of Grimaldi upon the equator towards the eastern border of\nthe orb.\n\nPluto is a circular mountain, situated in north lat. 51\u00b0 and east long.\n9\u00b0. Its circle is fifty miles long and thirty wide. Barbicane regretted\nnot passing perpendicularly over this vast opening. There was an abyss\nto see, perhaps some mysterious phenomenon to become acquainted with.\nBut the course of the projectile could not be guided. There was nothing\nto do but submit. A balloon could not be guided, much less a projectile\nwhen you are inside.\n\nAbout 5 a.m. the northern limit of the Sea of Rains was at last passed.\nMounts La Condamine and Fontenelle remained, the one on the left, the\nother on the right. That part of the disc, starting from the 60th\ndegree, became absolutely mountainous. The telescopes brought it to\nwithin one league, an inferior distance to that between the summit of\nMont Blanc and the sea level. All this region was bristling with peaks\nand amphitheatres. Mount Philolaus rose about the 70th degree to a\nheight of 3,700 metres, opening an elliptical crater sixteen leagues\nlong and four wide.\n\nThen the disc, seen from that distance, presented an exceedingly strange\naspect. The landscapes were very different to earthly ones, and also\nvery inferior.\n\nThe moon having no atmosphere, this absence of vaporous covering had\nconsequences already pointed out. There is no twilight on its surface,\nnight following day and day following night, with the suddenness of a\nlamp extinguished or lighted in profound darkness. There is no\ntransition from cold to heat: the temperature falls in one instant from\nboiling water heat to the cold of space.\n\nAnother consequence of this absence of air is the following:--Absolute\ndarkness reigns where the sun's rays do not penetrate. What is called\ndiffused light upon the earth, the luminous matter that the air holds\nin suspension, which creates twilights and dawns, which produces\nshadows, penumbrae, and all the magic of the chiaro-oscuro, does not\nexist upon the moon. Hence the harshness of contrasts that only admit\ntwo colours, black and white. If a Selenite shades his eyes from the\nsolar rays the sky appears absolutely dark, and the stars shine as in\nthe darkest nights.\n\nThe impression produced on Barbicane and his two friends by this strange\nstate of things may well be imagined. They did not know how to use their\neyes. They could no longer seize the respective distances in\nperspective. A lunar landscape, which does not soften the phenomenon of\nthe chiaro-oscuro, could not be painted by a landscape-painter of the\nearth. It would be nothing but blots of ink upon white paper.\n\nThis aspect of things did not alter even when the projectile, then at\nthe altitude of the 80th degree, was only separated from the moon by a\ndistance of fifty miles, not even when, at 5 a.m., it passed at less\nthan twenty-five miles from the mountain of Gioja, a distance which the\ntelescopes reduced to half-a-mile. It seemed as if they could have\ntouched the moon. It appeared impossible that before long the projectile\nshould not knock against it, if only at the North Pole, where the\nbrilliant mountains were clearly outlined against the dark background of\nthe sky. Michel Ardan wanted to open one of the port-lights and jump\nupon the lunar surface. What was a fall of twelve leagues? He thought\nnothing of that. It would, however, have been a useless attempt, for if\nthe projectile was not going to reach any point on the satellite, Michel\nwould have been hurled along by its movement, and not have reached it\neither.\n\nAt that moment, 6 a.m., the lunar pole appeared. Only half the disc,\nbrilliantly lighted, appeared to the travellers, whilst the other half\ndisappeared in the darkness. The projectile suddenly passed the line of\ndemarcation between intense light and absolute darkness, and was\nsuddenly plunged into the profoundest night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nA NIGHT OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FOUR HOURS AND A HALF.\n\n\nAt the moment this phenomenon took place the projectile was grazing the\nmoon's North Pole, at less that twenty-five miles' distance. A few\nseconds had, therefore, sufficed to plunge it into the absolute darkness\nof space. The transition had taken place so rapidly, without gradations\nof light or attenuation of the luminous undulations, that the orb seemed\nto have been blown out by a powerful gust.\n\n\"The moon has melted, disappeared!\" cried Michel Ardan, wonder-stricken.\n\nIn fact, no ray of light or shade had appeared on the disc, formerly so\nbrilliant. The obscurity was complete, and rendered deeper still by the\nshining of the stars. It was the darkness of lunar night, which lasts\n354 hours and a half on each point of the disc--a long night, the result\nof the equality of the movements of translation and rotation of the\nmoon, the one upon herself, the other round the earth. The projectile in\nthe satellite's cone of shadow was no longer under the action of the\nsolar rays.\n\nIn the interior darkness was, therefore, complete. The travellers could\nno longer see one another. Hence came the necessity to lighten this\ndarkness. However desirous Barbicane might be to economise the gas, of\nwhich he had so small a reserve, he was obliged to have recourse to it\nfor artificial light--an expensive brilliancy which the sun then\nrefused.\n\n\"The devil take the radiant orb!\" cried Michel Ardan; \"he is going to\nforce us to spend our gas instead of giving us his rays for nothing.\"\n\n\"We must not accuse the sun,\" said Nicholl. \"It is not his fault, it is\nthe moon's fault for coming and putting herself like a screen between us\nand him.\"\n\n\"It's the sun!\" said Michel again.\n\n\"It's the moon!\" retorted Nicholl.\n\nAn idle dispute began, which Barbicane put an end to by saying--\n\n\"My friends, it is neither the fault of the sun nor the moon. It is the\nprojectile's fault for deviating from its course instead of rigorously\nfollowing it. Or, to be juster still, it is the fault of that\nunfortunate asteroid which so deplorably altered our first direction.\"\n\n\"Good!\" answered Michel Ardan; \"as that business is settled let us have\nour breakfast. After a night entirely passed in making observations, we\nwant something to set us to rights a little.\"\n\nThis proposition met with no contradiction. Michel prepared the repast\nin a few minutes. But they ate for the sake of eating. They drank\nwithout toasts or hurrahs. The bold travellers, borne away into the\ndarkness of space without their accustomed escort of rays, felt a vague\nuneasiness invade their hearts. The \"farouche\" darkness, so dear to the\npen of Victor Hugo, surrounded them on all sides.\n\nIn the meantime they talked about this interminable night, 354 hours, or\nnearly 15 days, long, which physical laws have imposed upon the\ninhabitants of the moon. Barbicane gave his friends some explanation of\nthe causes and consequences of this curious phenomenon.\n\n\"Curious it certainly is,\" said he, \"for if each hemisphere of the moon\nis deprived of solar light for fifteen days, the one over which we are\nmoving at this moment does not even enjoy, during its long night, a\nsight of the brilliantly-lighted earth. In a word, there is no moon,\napplying that qualification to our spheroid, except for one side of the\ndisc. Now, if it was the same upon earth--if, for example, Europe never\nsaw the moon, and she was only visible at the antipodes--you can figure\nto yourselves the astonishment of a European on arriving in Australia.\"\n\n\"They would make the voyage for nothing but to go and see the moon,\"\nanswered Michel.\n\n\"Well,\" resumed Barbicane, \"that astonishment is reserved to the\nSelenite who inhabits the opposite side of the moon to the earth, a side\nfor ever invisible to our fellow-beings of the terrestrial globe.\"\n\n\"And which we should have seen,\" added Nicholl, \"if we had arrived here\nat the epoch when the moon is new--that is to say, a fortnight later.\"\n\n\"To make amends,\" resumed Barbicane, \"an inhabitant of the visible face\nis singularly favoured by Nature to the detriment on the invisible face.\nThe latter, as you see, has dark nights of 354 hours long, without a ray\nof light to penetrate the obscurity. The other, on the contrary, when\nthe sun, which has lighted him for a fortnight, sets under the horizon,\nsees on the opposite horizon a splendid orb rise. It is the earth,\nthirteen times larger than that moon which we know--the earth, which is\ndeveloped to a diameter of two degrees, and which sheds a light thirteen\ntimes greater, which no atmosphere qualifies; the earth, which only\ndisappears when the sun reappears.\"\n\n\"A fine sentence,\" said Michel Ardan; \"rather academical perhaps.\"\n\n\"It follows,\" resumed Barbicane, nowise put out, \"that the visible face\nof the disc must be very agreeable to inhabit, as it is always lighted\nby the sun or the moon.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Nicholl, \"this advantage must be quite compensated by the\nunbearable heat which this light must cause.\"\n\n\"This inconvenience is the same under two faces, for the light reflected\nby the earth is evidently deprived of heat. However, this invisible face\nis still more deprived of heat than the visible face. I say that for\nyou, Nicholl; Michel would probably not understand.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Michel.\n\n\"In fact,\" resumed Barbicane, \"when the invisible face receives the\nsolar light and heat the moon is new--that is to say, that she is in\nconjunction, that she is situated between the sun and the earth. She is\nthen, on account of the situation which she occupies in opposition when\nshe is full, nearer the sun by the double of her distance from the\nearth. Now this distance may be estimated at the two-hundredth part of\nthat which separates the sun and the earth; or, in round numbers, at two\nhundred thousand leagues. Therefore this visible face is nearer the sun\nby two hundred thousand leagues when it receives his rays.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" replied Nicholl.\n\n\"Whilst--\" resumed Barbicane.\n\n\"Allow me,\" said Michel, interrupting his grave companion.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I want to go on with the explanation.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"To prove that I have understood.\"\n\n\"Go on, then,\" said Barbicane, smiling.\n\n\"Whilst,\" said Michel, imitating the tone and gestures of President\nBarbicane, \"when the visible face of the moon is lighted by the sun the\nmoon is full--that is to say, situated with regard to the earth the\nopposite to the sun. The distance which separates it from the radiant\norb is then increased in round numbers by 200,000 leagues, and the heat\nwhich it receives must be rather less.\"\n\n\"Well done!\" exclaimed Barbicane. \"Do you know, Michel, for an artist\nyou are intelligent.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Michel carelessly, \"we are all intelligent on the\nBoulevard des Italiens.\"\n\nBarbicane shook hands gravely with his amiable companion, and went on\nenumerating the few advantages reserved to the inhabitants of the\nvisible face.\n\nAmongst others he quoted the observations of the sun's eclipses, which\ncan only be seen from one side of the lunar disc, because the moon must\nbe in opposition before they can take place. These eclipses, caused by\nthe interposition of the earth between the sun and the moon, may last\ntwo hours, during which, on account of the rays refracted by its\natmosphere, the terrestrial globe can only appear like a black spot upon\nthe sun.\n\n\"Then,\" said Nicholl, \"the invisible hemisphere is very ill-treated by\nNature.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Barbicane, \"but not the whole of it. By a certain\nmovement of liberation, a sort of balancing on its centre, the moon\npresents more than the half of her disc to the earth. She is like a\npendulum, the centre of gravity of which is towards the terrestrial\nglobe, and which oscillates regularly. Whence comes that oscillation?\nBecause her movement of rotation on her axis is animated with uniform\nvelocity, whilst her movement of translation, following an elliptical\norb round the earth, is not. At the perigee the velocity of translation\nis greater, and the moon shows a certain portion of her western border.\nAt her apogee the velocity of rotation is greater, and a morsel of her\neastern border appears. It is a strip of about eight degrees, which\nappears sometimes on the west, sometimes on the east. The result is,\ntherefore, that of a thousand parts the moon shows five hundred and\nsixty-nine.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" answered Michel; \"if we ever become Selenites, we will\ninhabit the visible face. I like light.\"\n\n\"Unless,\" replied Nicholl, \"the atmosphere should be condensed on the\nother side, as certain astronomers pretend.\"\n\n\"That is a consideration,\" answered Michel simply.\n\nIn the meantime breakfast was concluded, and the observers resumed their\nposts. They tried to see through the dark port-light by putting out all\nlight in the projectile. But not one luminous atom penetrated the\nobscurity.\n\nOne inexplicable fact preoccupied Barbicane. How was it that though the\nprojectile had been so near the moon, within a distance of twenty-five\nmiles, it had not fallen upon her? If its speed had been enormous, he\nwould have understood why it had not fallen. But with a relatively\nslight speed the resistance to lunar attraction could not be explained.\nWas the projectile under the influence of some strange force? Did some\nbody maintain it in the ether? It was henceforth evident that it would\nnot touch any point upon the moon. Where was it going? Was it going\nfarther away from or nearer to the disc? Was it carried along in the\ngloom across infinitude? How were they to know, how calculate in the\ndark? All these questions made Barbicane anxious, but he could not solve\nthem.\n\nIn fact, the invisible orb was there, perhaps, at a distance of some\nleagues only, but neither his companions nor he could any longer see it.\nIf any noise was made on its surface they could not hear it. The air,\nthat vehicle of transmission, was wanting to convey to them the groans\nof that moon which the Arabian legends make \"a man already half-granite,\nbut still palpitating.\"\n\nIt will be agreed that it was enough to exasperate the most patient\nobservers. It was precisely the unknown hemisphere that was hidden from\ntheir eyes. That face which a fortnight sooner or a fortnight later had\nbeen, or would be, splendidly lighted up by the solar rays, was then\nlost in absolute darkness. Where would the projectile be in another\nfortnight? Where would the hazards of attraction have taken it? Who\ncould say?\n\nIt is generally admitted that the invisible hemisphere of the moon is,\nby its constitution, absolutely similar to the visible hemisphere.\nOne-seventh of it is seen in those movements of libration Barbicane\nspoke of. Now upon the surface seen there were only plains and\nmountains, amphitheatres and craters, like those on the maps. They could\nthere imagine the same arid and dead nature. And yet, supposing the\natmosphere to have taken refuge upon that face? Suppose that with the\nair water had given life to these regenerated continents? Suppose that\nvegetation still persists there? Suppose that animals people these\ncontinents and seas? Suppose that man still lives under those conditions\nof habitability? How many questions there were it would have been\ninteresting to solve! What solutions might have been drawn from the\ncontemplation of that hemisphere! What delight it would have been to\nglance at that world which no human eye has seen!\n\nThe disappointment of the travellers in the midst of this darkness may\nbe imagined. All observation of the lunar disc was prevented. The\nconstellations alone were visible, and it must be acknowledged that no\nastronomers, neither Faye, Chacornac, nor the Secchi, had ever been in\nsuch favourable conditions to observe them.\n\nIn fact, nothing could equal the splendour of this starry world, bathed\nin limpid ether. Diamonds set in the celestial vault threw out superb\nflames. One look could take in the firmament from the Southern Cross to\nthe North Star, those two constellations which will in 12,000 years, on\naccount of the succession of equinoxes, resign their _r\u00f4les_ of polar\nstars, the one to Canopus in the southern hemisphere, the other to Wega\nin the northern. Imagination lost itself in this sublime infinitude,\namidst which the projectile was moving like a new star created by the\nhand of man. From natural causes these constellations shone with a soft\nlustre; they did not twinkle because there was no atmosphere to\nintervene with its strata unequally dense, and of different degrees of\nhumidity, which causes this scintillation.\n\nThe travellers long watched the constellated firmament, upon which the\nvast screen of the moon made an enormous black hole. But a painful\nsensation at length drew them from their contemplation. This was an\nintense cold, which soon covered the glasses of the port-lights with a\nthick coating of ice. The sun no longer warmed the projectile with his\nrays, and it gradually lost the heat stored up in its walls. This heat\nwas by radiation rapidly evaporated into space, and a considerable\nlowering of the temperature was the result. The interior humidity was\nchanged into ice by contact with the window-panes, and prevented all\nobservation.\n\nNicholl, consulting the thermometer, said that it had fallen to 17\u00b0\n(centigrade) below zero (1\u00b0 Fahr). Therefore, notwithstanding every\nreason for being economical, Barbicane was obliged to seek heat as well\nas light from gas. The low temperature of the bullet was no longer\nbearable. Its occupants would have been frozen to death.\n\n\"We will not complain about the monotony of the journey,\" said Michel\nArdan. \"What variety we have had, in temperature at all events! At times\nwe have been blinded with light, and saturated with heat like the\nIndians of the Pampas! Now we are plunged into profound darkness amidst\nboreal cold, like the Esquimaux of the pole! No, indeed! We have no\nright to complain, and Nature has done many things in our honour!\"\n\n\"But,\" asked Nicholl, \"what is the exterior temperature?\"\n\n\"Precisely that of planetary space,\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"Then,\" resumed Michel Ardan, \"would not this be an opportunity for\nmaking that experiment we could not attempt when we were bathed in the\nsolar rays?\"\n\n\"Now or never,\" answered Barbicane, \"for we are usefully situated in\norder to verify the temperature of space, and see whether the\ncalculations of Fourier or Pouillet are correct.\"\n\n\"Any way it is cold enough,\" said Michel. \"Look at the interior humidity\ncondensing on the port-lights. If this fall continues the vapour of our\nrespiration will fall around us in snow.\"\n\n\"Let us get a thermometer,\" said Barbicane.\n\nIt will be readily seen that an ordinary thermometer would have given no\nresult under the circumstances in which it was going to be exposed. The\nmercury would have frozen in its cup, for it does not keep liquid below\n44\u00b0 below zero. But Barbicane had provided himself with a spirit\nthermometer, on the Walferdin system, which gives the minima of\nexcessively low temperature.\n\nBefore beginning the experiment this instrument was compared with an\nordinary thermometer, and Barbicane prepared to employ it.\n\n\"How shall we manage it?\" asked Nicholl.\n\n\"Nothing is easier,\" answered Michel Ardan, who was never at a loss.\n\"Open the port-light rapidly, throw out the instrument; it will follow\nthe projectile with exemplary docility; a quarter of an hour after take\nit in.\"\n\n\"With your hand?\" asked Barbicane.\n\n\"With my hand,\" answered Michel.\n\n\"Well, then, my friend, do not try it,\" said Barbicane, \"for the hand\nyou draw back will be only a stump, frozen and deformed by the frightful\ncold.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"You would feel the sensation of a terrible burn, like one made with a\nred-hot iron, for the same thing happens when heat is brutally\nabstracted from our body as when it is inserted. Besides, I am not sure\nthat objects thrown out still follow us.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"Because if we are passing through any atmosphere, however slightly\ndense, these objects will be delayed. Now the darkness prevents us\nverifying whether they still float around us. Therefore, in order not to\nrisk our thermometer, we will tie something to it, and so easily pull it\nback into the interior.\"\n\nBarbicane's advice was followed. Nicholl threw the instrument out of the\nrapidly-opened port-light, holding it by a very short cord, so that it\ncould be rapidly drawn in. The window was only open one second, and yet\nthat one second was enough to allow the interior of the projectile to\nbecome frightfully cold.\n\n\"_Mille diables!_\" cried Michel Ardan, \"it is cold enough here to freeze\nwhite bears!\"\n\nBarbicane let half-an-hour go by, more than sufficient time to allow the\ninstrument to descend to the level of the temperature of space. The\nthermometer was then rapidly drawn in.\n\nBarbicane calculated the quantity of mercury spilt into the little phial\nsoldered to the lower part of the instrument, and said--\n\n\"One hundred and forty degrees centigrade below zero!\" (218\u00b0 Fahr.)\n\nM. Pouillet was right, not Fourier. Such was the frightful temperature\nof sidereal space! Such perhaps that of the lunar continents when the\norb of night loses by radiation all the heat which she absorbs during\nthe fifteen days of sunshine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nHYPERBOLA OR PARABOLA.\n\n\nOur readers will probably be astonished that Barbicane and his\ncompanions were so little occupied with the future in store for them in\ntheir metal prison, carried along in the infinitude of ether. Instead of\nasking themselves where they were going, they lost their time in making\nexperiments, just as if they had been comfortably installed in their\nown studies.\n\nIt might be answered that men so strong-minded were above such\nconsiderations, that such little things did not make them uneasy, and\nthat they had something else to do than to think about their future.\n\nThe truth is that they were not masters of their projectile--that they\ncould neither stop it nor alter its direction. A seaman can direct the\nhead of his ship as he pleases; an a\u00ebronaut can give his balloon\nvertical movement. They, on the contrary, had no authority over their\nvehicle. No manoeuvre was possible to them. Hence their not troubling\nthemselves, or \"let things go\" state of mind.\n\nWhere were they at that moment, 8 a.m. during that day called upon earth\nthe sixth of December? Certainly in the neighbourhood of the moon, and\neven near enough for her to appear like a vast black screen upon the\nfirmament. As to the distance which separated them, it was impossible to\nestimate it. The projectile, kept up by inexplicable forces, has grazed\nthe north pole of the satellite at less than twenty-five miles'\ndistance. But had that distance increased or diminished since they had\nbeen in the cone of shadow? There was no landmark by which to estimate\neither the direction or the velocity of the projectile. Perhaps it was\ngoing rapidly away from the disc and would soon leave the pure shadow.\nPerhaps, on the contrary, it was approaching it, and would before long\nstrike against some elevated peak in the invisible atmosphere, which\nwould have terminated the journey, doubtless to the detriment of the\ntravellers.\n\nA discussion began upon this subject, and Michel Ardan, always rich in\nexplanations, gave out the opinion that the bullet, restrained by lunar\nattraction, would end by falling on the moon like an a\u00ebrolite on to the\nsurface of the terrestrial globe.\n\n\"In the first place,\" answered Barbicane, \"all a\u00ebrolites do not fall\nupon the surface of the earth; only a small proportion do so. Therefore,\nif we are a\u00ebrolites it does not necessarily follow that we shall fall\nupon the moon.\"\n\n\"Still,\" answered Michel, \"if we get near enough--\"\n\n\"Error,\" replied Barbicane. \"Have you not seen shooting stars by\nthousands in the sky at certain epochs?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, those stars, or rather corpuscles, only shine by rubbing against\nthe atmospheric strata. Now, if they pass through the atmosphere, they\npass at less than 16 miles from our globe, and yet they rarely fall. It\nis the same with our projectile. It may approach very near the moon, and\nyet not fall upon it.\"\n\n\"But then,\" asked Michel, \"I am curious to know how our vehicle would\nbehave in space.\"\n\n\"I only see two hypotheses,\" answered Barbicane, after some minutes'\nreflection.\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"The projectile has the choice between two mathematical curves, and it\nwill follow the one or the other according to the velocity with which it\nis animated, and which I cannot now estimate.\"\n\n\"Yes, it will either describe a parabola or an hyperbola.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Barbicane, \"with some speed it will describe a parabola,\nand with greater speed an hyperbola.\"\n\n\"I like those grand words!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan. \"I know at once what\nyou mean. And what is your parabola, if you please?\"\n\n\"My friend,\" answered the captain, \"a parabola is a conic section\narising from cutting a cone by a plane parallel to one of its sides.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Michel in a satisfied tone.\n\n\"It is about the same trajectory that the bomb of a howitzer describes.\"\n\n\"Just so. And an hyperbola?\" asked Michel.\n\n\"It is a curve formed by a section of a cone when the cutting plane\nmakes a greater angle with the base than the side of the cone makes.\"\n\n\"Is it possible?\" exclaimed Michel Ardan in the most serious tone, as if\nhe had been informed of a grave event. \"Then remember this, Captain\nNicholl, what I like in your definition of the hyperbola--I was going to\nsay of the hyperhumbug--is that it is still less easy to understand than\nthe word you pretend to define.\"\n\nNicholl and Barbicane paid no attention to Michel Ardan's jokes. They\nhad launched into a scientific discussion. They were eager about what\ncurve the projectile would take. One was for the hyperbola, the other\nfor the parabola. They gave each other reasons bristling with _x_'s.\nTheir arguments were presented in a language which made Michel Ardan\njump. The discussion was lively, and neither of the adversaries would\nsacrifice his curve of predilection.\n\nThis scientific dispute was prolonged until Michel Ardan became\nimpatient, and said--\n\n\"I say, Messrs. Cosine, do leave off throwing your hyperbolas and\nparabolas at one's head. I want to know the only interesting thing about\nthe business. We shall follow one or other of your curves. Very well.\nBut where will they take us to?\"\n\n\"Nowhere,\" answered Nicholl.\n\n\"How nowhere?\"\n\n\"Evidently they are unfinished curves, prolonged indefinitely!\"\n\n\"Ah, _savants_! What does it matter about hyperbola or parabola if they\nboth carry us indefinitely into space?\"\n\nBarbicane and Nicholl could not help laughing. They cared for art for\nits own sake. Never had more useless question been discussed at a more\ninopportune moment. The fatal truth was that the projectile, whether\nhyperbolically or parabolically carried along, would never strike\nagainst either the earth or the moon.\n\nWhat would become of these bold travellers in the most immediate future?\nIf they did not die of hunger or thirst, they would in a few days, when\ngas failed them, die for want of air, if the cold had not killed them\nfirst!\n\nStill, although it was so important to economise gas, the excessive\nlowness of the surrounding temperature forced them to consume a certain\nquantity. They could not do without either its light or heat. Happily\nthe caloric developed by the Reiset and Regnault apparatus slightly\nelevated the temperature of the projectile, and without spending much\nthey could raise it to a bearable degree.\n\nIn the meantime observation through the port-lights had become very\ndifficult. The steam inside the bullet condensed upon the panes and\nfroze immediately. They were obliged to destroy the opacity of the glass\nby constant rubbing. However, they could record several phenomena of the\nhighest interest.\n\nIn fact, if the invisible disc had any atmosphere, the shooting stars\nwould be seen passing through it. If the projectile itself passed\nthrough the fluid strata, might it not hear some noise echoed--a storm,\nfor instance, an avalanche, or a volcano in activity? Should they not\nsee the intense fulgurations of a burning mountain? Such facts,\ncarefully recorded, would have singularly elucidated the obscure\nquestion of the lunar constitution. Thus Barbicane and Nicholl, standing\nlike astronomers at their port-lights, watched with scrupulous patience.\n\nBut until then the disc remained mute and dark. It did not answer the\nmultifarious interrogations of these ardent minds.\n\nThis provoked from Michel a reflection that seemed correct enough.\n\n\"If ever we recommence our journey, we shall do well to choose the epoch\nwhen the moon is new.\"\n\n\"True,\" answered Nicholl, \"that circumstance would have been more\nfavourable. I agree that the moon, bathed in sunlight, would not be\nvisible during the passage, but on the other hand the earth would be\nfull. And if we are dragged round the moon like we are now, we should\nat least have the advantage of seeing the invisible disc magnificently\nlighted up.\"\n\n\"Well said, Nicholl,\" replied Michel Ardan. \"What do you think about it,\nBarbicane?\"\n\n\"I think this,\" answered the grave president: \"if ever we recommence\nthis journey, we shall start at the same epoch, and under the same\ncircumstances. Suppose we had reached our goal, would it not have been\nbetter to find the continents in full daylight instead of dark night?\nWould not our first installation have been made under better\ncircumstances? Yes, evidently. As to the invisible side, we could have\nvisited that in our exploring expeditions on the lunar globe. So,\ntherefore, the time of the full moon was well chosen. But we ought to\nhave reached our goal, and in order to have reached it we ought not to\nhave deviated from our road.\"\n\n\"There is no answer to make to that,\" said Michel Ardan. \"Yet we have\npassed a fine opportunity for seeing the moon! Who knows whether the\ninhabitants of the other planets are not more advanced than the\n_savants_ of the earth on the subject of their satellites?\"\n\nThe following answer might easily have been given to Michel Ardan's\nremark:--Yes, other satellites, on account of their greater proximity,\nhave made the study of them easier. The inhabitants of Saturn, Jupiter,\nand Uranus, if they exist, have been able to establish communication\nwith their moons much more easily. The four satellites of Jupiter\ngravitate at a distance of 108,260 leagues, 172,200 leagues, 274,700\nleagues, and 480,130 leagues. But these distances are reckoned from the\ncentre of the planet, and by taking away the radius, which is 17,000 to\n18,000 leagues, it will be seen that the first satellite is at a much\nless distance from the surface of Jupiter than the moon is from the\ncentre of the earth. Of the eight moons of Saturn, four are near. Diana\nis 84,600 leagues off; Thetys, 62,966 leagues; Enceladus, 48,191\nleagues; and lastly, Mimas is at an average distance of 34,500 leagues\nonly. Of the eighteen satellites of Uranus, the first, Ariel, is only\n51,520 leagues from the planet.\n\nTherefore, upon the surface of those three stars, an experiment\nanalogous to that of President Barbicane would have presented less\ndifficulties. If, therefore, their inhabitants have attempted the\nenterprise, they have, perhaps, acquainted themselves with the\nconstitution of the half of the disc which their satellite hides\neternally from their eyes. But if they have never left their planet,\nthey do not know more about them than the astronomers of the earth.\n\nIn the meantime the bullet was describing in the darkness that\nincalculable trajectory which no landmark allowed them to find out. Was\nits direction altered either under the influence of lunar attraction or\nunder the action of some unknown orb? Barbicane could not tell. But a\nchange had taken place in the relative position of the vehicle, and\nBarbicane became aware of it about 4 a.m.\n\nThe change consisted in this, that the bottom of the projectile was\nturned towards the surface of the moon, and kept itself perpendicular\nwith its axis. The attraction or gravitation had caused this\nmodification. The heaviest part of the bullet inclined towards the\ninvisible disc exactly as if it had fallen towards it.\n\nWas it falling then? Were the travellers at last about to reach their\ndesired goal? No. And the observation of one landmark, inexplicable in\nitself, demonstrated to Barbicane that his projectile was not nearing\nthe moon, and that it was following an almost concentric curve.\n\nThis was a flash of light which Nicholl signalised all at once on the\nlimit of the horizon formed by the black disc. This point could not be\nmistaken for a star. It was a reddish flame, which grew gradually\nlarger--an incontestable proof that the projectile was getting nearer\nit, and not falling normally upon the surface of the satellite.\n\n\"A volcano! It is a volcano in activity!\" exclaimed Nicholl--\"an\neruption of the interior fires of the moon. That world, then, is not\nquite extinguished.\"\n\n\"Yes, an eruption!\" answered Barbicane, who studied the phenomenon\ncarefully through his night-glass. \"What should it be if not a volcano?\"\n\n\"But then,\" said Michel Ardan, \"air is necessary to feed that\ncombustion, therefore there is some atmosphere on that part of the\nmoon.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" answered Barbicane, \"but not necessarily. A volcano, by\nthe decomposition of certain matters, can furnish itself with oxygen,\nand so throw up flames into the void. It seems to me, too, that that\ndeflagration has the intensity and brilliancy of objects the combustion\nof which is produced in pure oxygen. We must not be in a hurry to affirm\nthe existence of a lunar atmosphere.\"\n\nThe burning mountain was situated at the 45th degree of south latitude\non the invisible part of the disc. But to the great disappointment of\nBarbicane the curve that the projectile described dragged it away from\nthe point signalised by the eruption, therefore he could not exactly\ndetermine its nature. Half-an-hour after it had first been seen this\nluminous point disappeared on the horizon. Still the authentication of\nthis phenomenon was a considerable fact in selenographic studies. It\nproved that all heat had not yet disappeared from the interior of this\nglobe, and where heat exists, who may affirm that the vegetable kingdom,\nor even the animal kingdom itself, has not until now resisted the\ndestructive influences? The existence of this volcano in eruption,\nindisputably established by earthly _savants_, was favourable to the\ntheory of the habitability of the moon.\n\nBarbicane became absorbed in reflection. He forgot himself in a mute\nreverie, filled with the mysterious destinies of the lunar world. He was\ntrying to connect the facts observed up till then, when a fresh incident\nrecalled him suddenly to the reality.\n\nThis incident was more than a cosmic phenomenon; it was a threatening\ndanger, the consequences of which might be disastrous.\n\nSuddenly in the midst of the ether, in the profound darkness, an\nenormous mass had appeared. It was like a moon, but a burning moon of\nalmost unbearable brilliancy, outlined as it was on the total obscurity\nof space. This mass, of a circular form, threw such light that it filled\nthe projectile. The faces of Barbicane, Nicholl, and Michel Ardan,\nbathed in its white waves, looked spectral, livid, _blafard_, like the\nappearance produced by the artificial light of alcohol impregnated with\nsalt.\n\n\"The devil!\" cried Michel Ardan. \"How hideous we are! Whatever is that\nwretched moon?\"\n\n\"It is a bolis,\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"A bolis, on fire, in the void?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThis globe of fire was indeed a bolis. Barbicane was not mistaken. But\nif these cosmic meteors, seen from the earth, present an inferior light\nto that of the moon, here, in the dark ether, they shone magnificently.\nThese wandering bodies carry in themselves the principle of their own\nincandescence. The surrounding air is not necessary to the deflagration.\nAnd, indeed, if certain of these bodies pass through our atmosphere at\ntwo or three leagues from the earth, others describe their trajectory at\na distance the atmosphere cannot reach. Some of these meteors are from\none to two miles wide, and move at a speed of forty miles a second,\nfollowing an inverse direction from the movement of the earth.\n\nThis shooting star suddenly appeared in the darkness at a distance of at\nleast 100 leagues, and measured, according to Barbicane's estimate, a\ndiameter of 2,000 metres. It moved with the speed of about thirty\nleagues a minute. It cut across the route of the projectile, and would\nreach it in a few minutes. As it approached it grew larger in an\nenormous proportion.\n\nIf possible, let the situation of the travellers be imagined! It is\nimpossible to describe it. In spite of their courage, their\n_sang-froid_, their carelessness of danger, they were mute, motionless,\nwith stiffened limbs, a prey to fearful terror. Their projectile, the\ncourse of which they could not alter, was running straight on to this\nburning mass, more intense than the open mouth of a furnace. They seemed\nto be rushing towards an abyss of fire.\n\nBarbicane seized the hands of his two companions, and all three looked\nthrough their half-closed eyelids at the red-hot asteroid. If they still\nthought at all, they must have given themselves up as lost!\n\nTwo minutes after the sudden appearance of the bolis, two centuries of\nagony, the projectile seemed about to strike against it, when the ball\nof fire burst like a bomb, but without making any noise in the void,\nwhere sound, which is only the agitation of the strata of air, could not\nbe made.\n\nNicholl uttered a cry. His companions and he rushed to the port-lights.\n\nWhat a spectacle! What pen could describe it, what palette would be rich\nenough in colours to reproduce its magnificence?\n\nIt was like the opening of a crater, or the spreading of an immense\nfire. Thousands of luminous fragments lit up space with their fires.\nEvery size, colour, and shade were there. There were yellow, red, green,\ngrey, a crown of multi-coloured fireworks. There only remained of the\nenormous and terrible globe pieces carried in all directions, each an\nasteroid in its turn, some shining like swords, some surrounded by white\nvapour, others leaving behind them a trail of cosmic dust.\n\nThese incandescent blocks crossed each other, knocked against each\nother, and were scattered into smaller fragments, of which some struck\nthe projectile. Its left window was even cracked by the violent shock.\nIt seemed to be floating in a shower of bullets, of which the least\ncould annihilate it in an instant.\n\nThe light which saturated the ether was of incomparable intensity, for\nthese asteroids dispersed it in every direction. At a certain moment it\nwas so bright that Michel dragged Barbicane and Nicholl to the window,\nexclaiming--\n\n\"The invisible moon is at last visible!\"\n\nAnd all three, across the illumination, saw for a few seconds that\nmysterious disc which the eye of man perceived for the first time.\n\nWhat did they distinguish across that distance which they could not\nestimate? Long bands across the disc, veritable clouds formed in a very\nrestricted atmospheric medium, from which emerged not only all the\nmountains, but every relief of middling importance, amphitheatres,\nyawning craters, such as exist on the visible face. Then immense tracts,\nno longer arid plains, but veritable seas, oceans which reflected in\ntheir liquid mirror all the dazzling magic of the fires of space.\nLastly, on the surface of the continents, vast dark masses, such as\nimmense forests would resemble under the rapid illumination of a flash\nof lightning.\n\nWas it an illusion, an error of the eyes, an optical deception? Could\nthey give a scientific affirmation to that observation so superficially\nobtained? Dared they pronounce upon the question of its habitability\nafter so slight a glimpse of the invisible disc?\n\nBy degrees the fulgurations of space gradually died out, its accidental\nbrilliancy lessened, the asteroids fled away by their different\ntrajectories, and went out in the distance. The ether resumed its\nhabitual darkness; the stars, for one moment eclipsed, shone in the\nfirmament, and the disc, of which scarcely a glimpse had been caught,\nwas lost in the impenetrable night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nTHE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE.\n\n\nThe projectile had just escaped a terrible danger, a danger quite\nunforeseen. Who would have imagined such a meeting of asteroids? These\nwandering bodies might prove serious perils to the travellers. They were\nto them like so many rocks in the sea of ether, which, less fortunate\nthan navigators, they could not avoid. But did these adventurers of\nspace complain? No, as Nature had given them the splendid spectacle of a\ncosmic meteor shining by formidable expansion, as this incomparable\ndisplay of fireworks, which no Ruggieri could imitate, had lighted for a\nfew seconds the invisible nimbus of the moon. During that rapid peep,\ncontinents, seas, and forests had appeared to them. Then the atmosphere\ndid give there its life-giving particles? Questions still not solved,\neternally asked by American curiosity.\n\nIt was then 3.30 p.m. The bullet was still describing its curve round\nthe moon. Had its route again been modified by the meteor? It was to be\nfeared. The projectile ought, however to describe a curve imperturbably\ndetermined by the laws of mechanics. Barbicane inclined to the opinion\nthat this curve would be a parabola and not an hyperbola. However, if\nthe parabola was admitted, the bullet ought soon to come out of the cone\nof shadow thrown into the space on the opposite side to the sun. This\ncone, in fact, is very narrow, the angular diameter of the moon is so\nsmall compared to the diameter of the orb of day. Until now the\nprojectile had moved in profound darkness. Whatever its speed had\nbeen--and it could not have been slight--its period of occultation\ncontinued. That fact was evident, but perhaps that would not have been\nthe case in a rigidly parabolical course. This was a fresh problem which\ntormented Barbicane's brain, veritably imprisoned as it was in a web of\nthe unknown which he could not disentangle.\n\nNeither of the travellers thought of taking a minute's rest. Each\nwatched for some unexpected incident which should throw a new light on\ntheir uranographic studies. About five o'clock Michel distributed to\nthem, by way of dinner, some morsels of bread and cold meat, which were\nrapidly absorbed, whilst no one thought of leaving the port-light, the\npanes of which were becoming incrusted under the condensation of vapour.\n\nAbout 5.45 p.m., Nicholl, armed with his telescope, signalised upon the\nsouthern border of the moon, and in the direction followed by the\nprojectile, a few brilliant points outlined against the dark screen of\nthe sky. They looked like a succession of sharp peaks with profiles in a\ntremulous line. They were rather brilliant. The terminal line of the\nmoon looks the same when she is in one of her octants.\n\nThey could not be mistaken. There was no longer any question of a simple\nmeteor, of which that luminous line had neither the colour nor the\nmobility, nor of a volcano in eruption. Barbicane did not hesitate to\ndeclare what it was.\n\n\"The sun!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"What! the sun!\" answered Nicholl and Michel Ardan.\n\n\"Yes, my friends, it is the radiant orb itself, lighting up the summit\nof the mountains situated on the southern border of the moon. We are\nevidently approaching the South Pole!\"\n\n\"After having passed the North Pole,\" answered Michel. \"Then we have\nbeen all round our satellite.\"\n\n\"Yes, friend Michel.\"\n\n\"Then we have no more hyperbolas, no more parabolas, no more open curves\nto fear!\"\n\n\"No, but a closed curve.\"\n\n\"Which is called--\"\n\n\"An ellipsis. Instead of being lost in the interplanetary spaces it is\npossible that the projectile will describe an elliptical orbit round the\nmoon.\"\n\n\"Really!\"\n\n\"And that it will become its satellite.\"\n\n\"Moon of the moon,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan.\n\n\"Only I must tell you, my worthy friend, that we are none the less lost\nmen on that account!\"\n\n\"No, but in another and much pleasanter way!\" answered the careless\nFrenchman, with his most amiable smile.\n\nPresident Barbicane was right. By describing this elliptical orbit the\nprojectile was going to gravitate eternally round the moon like a\nsub-satellite. It was a new star added to the solar world, a microcosm\npeopled by three inhabitants, whom want of air would kill before long.\nBarbicane, therefore, could not rejoice at the position imposed on the\nbullet by the double influence of the centripetal and centrifugal\nforces. His companions and he were again going to see the visible face\nof the disc. Perhaps their existence would last long enough for them to\nperceive for the last time the full earth superbly lighted up by the\nrays of the sun! Perhaps they might throw a last adieu to the globe they\nwere never more to see again! Then their projectile would be nothing but\nan extinct mass, dead like those inert asteroids which circulate in the\nether. A single consolation remained to them: it was that of seeing the\ndarkness and returning to light, it was that of again entering the zones\nbathed by solar irradiation!\n\nIn the meantime the mountains recognised by Barbicane stood out more and\nmore from the dark mass. They were Mounts Doerfel and Leibnitz, which\nstand on the southern circumpolar region of the moon.\n\nAll the mountains of the visible hemisphere have been measured with\nperfect exactitude. This perfection will, no doubt, seem astonishing,\nand yet the hypsometric methods are rigorous. The altitude of the lunar\nmountains may be no less exactly determined than that of the mountains\nof the earth.\n\nThe method generally employed is that of measuring the shadow thrown by\nthe mountains, whilst taking into account the altitude of the sun at the\nmoment of observation. This method also allows the calculating of the\ndepth of craters and cavities on the moon. Galileo used it, and since\nMessrs. Boeer and Moedler have employed it with the greatest success.\n\nAnother method, called the tangent radii, may also be used for measuring\nlunar reliefs. It is applied at the moment when the mountains form\nluminous points on the line of separation between light and darkness\nwhich shine on the dark part of the disc. These luminous points are\nproduced by the solar rays above those which determine the limit of the\nphase. Therefore the measure of the dark interval which the luminous\npoint and the luminous part of the phase leave between them gives\nexactly the height of the point. But it will be seen that this method\ncan only be applied to the mountains near the line of separation of\ndarkness and light.\n\nA third method consists in measuring the profile of the lunar mountains\noutlined on the background by means of a micrometer; but it is only\napplicable to the heights near the border of the orb.\n\nIn any case it will be remarked that this measurement of shadows,\nintervals, or profiles can only be made when the solar rays strike the\nmoon obliquely in relation to the observer. When they strike her\ndirectly--in a word, when she is full--all shadow is imperiously\nbanished from her disc, and observation is no longer possible.\n\nGalileo, after recognising the existence of the lunar mountains, was the\nfirst to employ the method of calculating their heights by the shadows\nthey throw. He attributed to them, as it has already been shown, an\naverage of 9,000 yards. Hevelius singularly reduced these figures, which\nRiccioli, on the contrary, doubled. All these measures were exaggerated.\nHerschel, with his more perfect instruments, approached nearer the\nhypsometric truth. But it must be finally sought in the accounts of\nmodern observers.\n\nMessrs. Boeer and Moedler, the most perfect selenographers in the whole\nworld, have measured 1,095 lunar mountains. It results from their\ncalculations that 6 of these mountains rise above 5,800 metres, and 22\nabove 4,800. The highest summit of the moon measures 7,603 metres; it\nis, therefore, inferior to those of the earth, of which some are 1,000\nyards higher. But one remark must be made. If the respective volumes of\nthe two orbs are compared the lunar mountains are relatively higher than\nthe terrestrial. The lunar ones form 1/70 of the diameter of the moon,\nand the terrestrial only form 1/140 of the diameter of the earth. For a\nterrestrial mountain to attain the relative proportions of a lunar\nmountain, its perpendicular height ought to be 6-1/2 leagues. Now the\nhighest is not four miles.\n\nThus, then, to proceed by comparison, the chain of the Himalayas counts\nthree peaks higher than the lunar ones, Mount Everest, Kunchinjuga, and\nDwalagiri. Mounts Doerfel and Leibnitz, on the moon, are as high as\nJewahir in the same chain. Newton, Casatus, Curtius, Short, Tycho,\nClavius, Blancanus, Endymion, the principal summits of Caucasus and the\nApennines, are higher than Mont Blanc. The mountains equal to Mont Blanc\nare Moret, Theophylus, and Catharnia; to Mount Rosa, Piccolomini,\nWerner, and Harpalus; to Mount Cervin, Macrobus, Eratosthenes,\nAlbateque, and Delambre; to the Peak of Teneriffe, Bacon, Cysatus,\nPhilolaus, and the Alps; to Mount Perdu, in the Pyrenees, Roemer and\nBoguslawski; to Etna, Hercules, Atlas, and Furnerius.\n\nSuch are the points of comparison that allow the appreciation of the\naltitude of lunar mountains. Now the trajectory followed by the\nprojectile dragged it precisely towards that mountainous region of the\nsouthern hemisphere where rise the finest specimens of lunar orography.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nTYCHO.\n\n\nAt 6 p.m. the projectile passed the South Pole at less than thirty\nmiles, a distance equal to that already reached at the North Pole. The\nelliptical curve was, therefore, being rigorously described.\n\nAt that moment the travellers re-entered the beneficent sunshine. They\nsaw once more the stars moving slowly from east to west. The radiant orb\nwas saluted with a triple hurrah. With its light came also its heat,\nwhich soon pierced the middle walls. The windows resumed their\naccustomed transparency. Their \"layer of ice\" melted as if by\nenchantment. The gas was immediately extinguished by way of economy. The\nair apparatus alone was to consume its habitual quantity.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Nicholl, \"sunshine is good! How impatiently after their long\nnights the Selenites must await the reappearance of the orb of day!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Michel Ardan, \"imbibing, as it were, the brilliant\nether, light and heat, all life is in them.\"\n\nAt that moment the bottom of the projectile moved slightly from the\nlunar surface in order to describe a rather long elliptical orbit. From\nthat point, if the earth had been full, Barbicane and his friends could\nhave seen it again. But, drowned in the sun's irradiation, it remained\nabsolutely invisible. Another spectacle attracted their eyes, presented\nby the southern region of the moon, brought by the telescopes to within\nhalf-a-mile. They left the port-lights no more, and noted all the\ndetails of the strange continent.\n\nMounts Doerfel and Leibnitz formed two separate groups stretching nearly\nto the South Pole; the former group extends from the Pole to the 84th\nparallel on the eastern part of the orb; the second, starting from the\neastern border, stretches from the 65th degree of latitude to the Pole.\n\nOn their capriciously-formed ridge appeared dazzling sheets of light\nlike those signalised by Father Secchi. With more certainty than the\nillustrious Roman astronomer, Barbicane was enabled to establish their\nnature.\n\n\"It is snow,\" cried he.\n\n\"Snow?\" echoed Nicholl.\n\n\"Yes, Nicholl, snow, the surface of which is profoundly frozen. Look how\nit reflects the luminous rays. Cooled lava would not give so intense a\nreflection. Therefore there is water and air upon the moon, as little as\nyou like, but the fact can no longer be contested.\"\n\nNo, it could not be, and if ever Barbicane saw the earth again his notes\nwould testify to this fact, important in selenographic observations.\n\nThese Mounts Doerfel and Leibnitz arose in the midst of plains of\nmoderate extent, bounded by an indefinite succession of amphitheatres\nand circular ramparts. These two chains are the only ones which are met\nwith in the region of amphitheatres. Relatively they are not very\nbroken, and only throw out here and there some sharp peaks, the highest\nof which measures 7,603 metres.\n\nThe projectile hung high above all this, and the relief disappeared in\nthe intense brilliancy of the disc.\n\nThen reappeared to the eyes of the travellers that original aspect of\nthe lunar landscapes, raw in tone, without gradation of colours, only\nwhite and black, for diffused light was wanting. Still the sight of this\ndesolate world was very curious on account of its very strangeness. They\nwere moving above this chaotic region as if carried along by the breath\nof a tempest, seeing the summits fly under their feet, looking down the\ncavities, climbing the ramparts, sounding the mysterious holes. But\nthere was no trace of vegetation, no appearance of cities, nothing but\nstratifications, lava streams, polished like immense mirrors, which\nreflect the solar rays with unbearable brilliancy. There was no\nappearance of a living world, everything of a dead one, where the\navalanches rolling from the summit of the mountains rushed noiselessly.\nThey had plenty of movement, but noise was wanting still.\n\nBarbicane established the fact, by reiterated observation, that the\nreliefs on the borders of the disc, although they had been acted upon\nby different forces to those of the central region, presented a uniform\nconformation. There was the same circular aggregation, the same\naccidents of ground. Still it might be supposed that their arrangements\nwere not completely analogous. In the centre the still malleable crust\nof the moon suffered the double attraction of the moon and the earth\nacting in inverse ways according to a radius prolonged from one to the\nother. On the borders of the disc, on the contrary, the lunar attraction\nhas been, thus to say, perpendicular with the terrestrial attraction. It\nseems, therefore, that the reliefs on the soil produced under these\nconditions ought to have taken a different form. Yet they had not,\ntherefore the moon had found in herself alone the principle of her\nformation and constitution. She owed nothing to foreign influences,\nwhich justified the remarkable proposition of Arago's, \"No action\nexterior to the moon has contributed to the production of her relief.\"\n\nHowever that may be in its actual condition, this world was the image of\ndeath without it being possible to say that life had ever animated it.\n\nMichel Ardan, however, thought he recognised a heap of ruins, to which\nhe drew Barbicane's attention. It was situated in about the 80th\nparallel and 30\u00b0 longitude. This heap of stones, pretty regularly made,\nwas in the shape of a vast fortress, overlooking one of those long\nfurrows which served as river-beds in ante-historical times. Not far off\nrose to a height of 5,646 metres the circular mountain called Short,\nequal to the Asiatic Caucasus. Michel Ardan, with his habitual ardour,\nmaintained \"the evidences\" of his fortress. Below he perceived the\ndismantled ramparts of a town; here the arch of a portico, still intact;\nthere two or three columns lying on their side; farther on a succession\nof archpieces, which must have supported the conduct of an aqueduct; in\nanother part the sunken pillars of a gigantic bridge run into the\nthickest part of the furrow. He distinguished all that, but with so much\nimagination in his eyes, through a telescope so fanciful, that his\nobservation cannot be relied upon. And yet who would affirm, who would\ndare to say, that the amiable fellow had not really seen what his two\ncompanions would not see?\n\nThe moments were too precious to be sacrificed to an idle discussion.\nThe Selenite city, whether real or pretended, had disappeared in the\ndistance. The projectile began to get farther away from the lunar disc,\nand the details of the ground began to be lost in a confused jumble. The\nreliefs, amphitheatres, craters, and plains alone remained, and still\nshowed their boundary-lines distinctly.\n\nAt that moment there stretched to the left one of the finest\namphitheatres in lunar orography. It was Newton, which Barbicane easily\nrecognised by referring to the _Mappa Selenographica_.\n\nNewton is situated in exactly 77\u00b0 south lat. and 16\u00b0 east long. It forms\na circular crater, the ramparts of which, 7,264 metres high, seemed to\nbe inaccessible.\n\nBarbicane made his companions notice that the height of that mountain\nabove the surrounding plain was far from being equal to the depth of its\ncrater. This enormous hole was beyond all measurement, and made a gloomy\nabyss, the bottom of which the sun's rays could never reach. There,\naccording to Humboldt, utter darkness reigns, which the light of the sun\nand the earth could not break. The mythologists would have made it with\njustice hell's mouth.\n\n\"Newton,\" said Barbicane, \"is the most perfect type of the circular\nmountains, of which the earth possesses no specimen. They prove that the\nformation of the moon by cooling was due to violent causes, for whilst\nunder the influence of interior fire the reliefs were thrown up to\nconsiderable heights, the bottom dropped in, and became lower than the\nlunar level.\"\n\n\"I do not say no,\" answered Michel Ardan.\n\nA few minutes after having passed Newton the projectile stood directly\nover the circular mountain of Moret. It also passed rather high above\nthe summits of Blancanus, and about 7.30 p.m. it reached the\namphitheatre of Clavius.\n\nThis circle, one of the most remarkable on the disc, is situated in\nsouth lat. 58\u00b0 and east long. 15\u00b0. Its height is estimated at 7,091\nmetres. The travellers at a distance of 200 miles, reduced to two by the\ntelescopes, could admire the arrangement of this vast crater.\n\n\"The terrestrial volcanoes,\" said Barbicane, \"are only molehills\ncompared to the volcanoes of the moon. Measuring the ancient craters\nformed by the first eruptions of Vesuvius and Etna, they are found to be\nscarcely 6,000 metres wide. In France the circle of the Cantal measures\nfive miles; at Ceylon the circle of the island is forty miles, and is\nconsidered the largest on the globe. What are these diameters compared\nto that of Clavius, which we are over in this moment?\"\n\n\"What is its width?\" asked Nicholl.\n\n\"About seventy miles,\" answered Barbicane. \"This amphitheatre is\ncertainly the largest on the moon, but many are fifty miles wide!\"\n\n\"Ah, my friends,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"can you imagine what this\npeaceful orb of night was once like? when these craters vomited torrents\nof lava and stones, with clouds of smoke and sheets of flame? What a\nprodigious spectacle formerly, and now what a falling off! This moon is\nnow only the meagre case of fireworks, of which the rockets, serpents,\nsuns, and wheels, after going off magnificently, only leave torn pieces\nof cardboard. Who can tell the cause, reason, or justification of such\ncataclysms?\"\n\nBarbicane did not listen to Michel Ardan. He was contemplating those\nramparts of Clavius, formed of wide mountains several leagues thick. At\nthe bottom of its immense cavity lay hundreds of small extinct craters,\nmaking the soil like a sieve, and overlooked by a peak more than 15,000\nfeet high.\n\nThe plain around had a desolate aspect. Nothing so arid as these\nreliefs, nothing so sad as these ruins of mountains, if so they may be\ncalled, as those heaps of peaks and mountains encumbering the ground!\nThe satellite seemed to have been blown up in this place.\n\nThe projectile still went on, and the chaos was still the same. Circles,\ncraters, and mountains succeeded each other incessantly. No more plains\nor seas--an interminable Switzerland or Norway. Lastly, in the centre of\nthe creviced region at its culminating point, the most splendid mountain\nof the lunar disc, the dazzling Tycho, to which posterity still gives\nthe name of the illustrious Danish astronomer.\n\nWhilst observing the full moon in a cloudless sky, there is no one who\nhas not remarked this brilliant point on the southern hemisphere. Michel\nArdan, to qualify it, employed all the metaphors his imagination could\nfurnish him with. To him Tycho was an ardent focus of light, a centre of\nirradiation, a crater vomiting flames! It was the axle of a fiery wheel,\na sea-star encircling the disc with its silver tentacles, an immense eye\ndarting fire, a nimbo made for Pluto's head! It was a star hurled by the\nhand of the Creator, and fallen upon the lunar surface!\n\nTycho forms such a luminous concentration that the inhabitants of the\nearth can see it without a telescope, although they are at a distance of\n100,000 leagues. It will, therefore, be readily imagined what its\nintensity must have been in the eyes of observers placed at fifty\nleagues only.\n\nAcross this pure ether its brilliancy was so unbearable that Barbicane\nand his friends were obliged to blacken the object-glasses of their\ntelescopes with gas-smoke in order to support it. Then, mute, hardly\nemitting a few admirative interjections, they looked and contemplated.\nAll their sentiments, all their impressions were concentrated in their\neyes, as life, under violent emotion, is concentrated in the heart.\n\nTycho belongs to the system of radiating mountains, like Aristarchus and\nCopernicus. But it testified the most completely of all to the terrible\nvolcanic action to which the formation of the moon is due.\n\nTycho is situated in south lat. 43\u00b0 and east long. 12\u00b0. Its centre is\noccupied by a crater more than forty miles wide. It affects a slightly\nelliptical form, and is inclosed by circular ramparts, which on the east\nand west overlook the exterior plain from a height of 5,000 metres. It\nis an aggregation of Mont Blancs, placed round a common centre, and\ncrowned with shining rays.\n\nPhotography itself could never represent what this incomparable\nmountain, with all its projections converging to it and its interior\nexcrescences, is really like. In fact, it is during the full moon that\nTycho is seen in all its splendour. Then all shadows disappear, the\nforeshortenings of perspective disappear, and all proofs come out\nwhite--an unfortunate circumstance, for this strange region would have\nbeen curious to reproduce with photographic exactitude. It is only an\nagglomeration of holes, craters, circles, a vertiginous network of\ncrests. It will be understood, therefore, that the bubblings of this\ncentral eruption have kept their first forms. Crystallised by cooling,\nthey have stereotyped the aspect which the moon formerly presented under\nthe influence of Plutonic forces.\n\nThe distance which separated the travellers from the circular summits of\nTycho was not so great that the travellers could not survey its\nprincipal details. Even upon the embankment which forms the ramparts of\nTycho, the mountains hanging to the interior and exterior slopes rose in\nstories like gigantic terraces. They appeared to be higher by 300 or 400\nfeet on the west than on the east. No system of terrestrial\ncastrametation could equal these natural fortifications. A town built at\nthe bottom of this circular cavity would have been utterly inaccessible.\n\nInaccessible and marvellously extended over this ground of picturesque\nrelief! Nature had not left the bottom of this crater flat and empty. It\npossessed a special orography, a mountain system which made it a world\napart. The travellers clearly distinguished the cones, central hills,\nremarkable movements of the ground, naturally disposed for the reception\nof masterpieces of Selenite architecture. There was the place for a\ntemple, here for a forum, there the foundations of a palace, there the\nplateau of a citadel, the whole overlooked by a central mountain 1,500\nfeet high--a vast circuit which would have held ancient Rome ten times\nover.\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, made enthusiastic by the sight, \"what\ngrand towns could be built in this circle of mountains! A tranquil city,\na peaceful refuge, away from all human cares! How all misanthropes could\nlive there, all haters of humanity, all those disgusted with social\nlife!\"\n\n\"All! It would be too small for them!\" replied Barbicane simply.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nGRAVE QUESTIONS.\n\n\nIn the meantime the projectile had passed the neighbourhood of Tycho.\nBarbicane and his two friends then observed, with the most scrupulous\nattention, those brilliant radii which the celebrated mountain disperses\nso curiously on every horizon.\n\nWhat was this radiating aureole? What geological phenomenon had caused\nthose ardent beams? This question justly occupied Barbicane. Under his\neyes, in every direction, ran luminous furrows, with raised banks and\nconcave middle, some ten miles, others more than twenty miles wide.\nThese shining trails ran in certain places at least 300 leagues from\nTycho, and seemed to cover, especially towards the east, north-east, and\nnorth, half the southern hemisphere. One of these furrows stretched as\nfar as the amphitheatre of Neander, situated on the 40th meridian.\nAnother went rounding off through the Sea of Nectar and broke against\nthe chain of the Pyrenees after a run of 400 leagues; others towards the\nwest covered with a luminous network the Sea of Clouds and the Sea of\nHumours.\n\nWhat was the origin of these shining rays running equally over plains\nand reliefs, however high? They all started from a common centre, the\ncrater of Tycho. They emanated from it.\n\nHerschel attributed their brilliant aspect to ancient streams of lava\ncongealed by the cold, an opinion which has not been generally received.\nOther astronomers have seen in these inexplicable rays a kind of\n_moraines_, ranges of erratic blocks thrown out at the epoch of the\nformation of Tycho.\n\n\"And why should it not be so?\" asked Nicholl of Barbicane, who rejected\nthese different opinions at the same time that he related them.\n\n\"Because the regularity of these luminous lines, and the violence\nnecessary to send them to such a distance, are inexplicable.\n\n\"_Par bleu_!\" replied Michel Ardan. \"I can easily explain to myself the\norigin of these rays.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Barbicane.\n\n\"Yes,\" resumed Michel. \"Why should they not be the cracks caused by the\nshock of a bullet or a stone upon a pane of glass?\"\n\n\"Good,\" replied Barbicane, smiling; \"and what hand would be powerful\nenough to hurl the stone that would produce such a shock?\"\n\n\"A hand is not necessary,\" answered Michel, who would not give in; \"and\nas to the stone, let us say it is a comet.\"\n\n\"Ah! comets?\" exclaimed Barbicane; \"those much-abused comets! My worthy\nMichel, your explanation is not bad, but your comet is not wanted. The\nshock might have come from the interior of the planet. A violent\ncontraction of the lunar crust whilst cooling was enough to make that\ngigantic crack.\"\n\n\"Contraction let it be--something like a lunar colic,\" answered Michel\nArdan.\n\n\"Besides,\" added Barbicane, \"that is also the opinion of an English\n_savant_, Nasmyth, and it seems to me to explain the radiation of these\nmountains sufficiently.\"\n\n\"That Nasmyth was no fool!\" answered Michel.\n\nThe travellers, who could never weary of such a spectacle, long admired\nthe splendours of Tycho. Their projectile, bathed in that double\nirradiation of the sun and moon, must have appeared like a globe of\nfire. They had, therefore, suddenly passed from considerable cold to\nintense heat. Nature was thus preparing them to become Selenites.\n\nTo become Selenites! That idea again brought up the question of the\nhabitability of the moon. After what they had seen, could the travellers\nsolve it? Could they conclude for or against? Michel Ardan asked his two\nfriends to give utterance to their opinion, and asked them outright if\nthey thought that humanity and animality were represented in the lunar\nworld.\n\n\"I think we cannot answer,\" said Barbicane, \"but in my opinion the\nquestion ought not to be stated in that form. I ask to be allowed to\nstate it differently.\"\n\n\"State it as you like,\" answered Michel.\n\n\"This is it,\" resumed Barbicane. \"The problem is double, and requires a\ndouble solution. Is the moon habitable? Has it been inhabited?\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Nicholl. \"Let us first see if the moon is habitable.\"\n\n\"To tell the truth, I know nothing about it,\" replied Michel.\n\n\"And I answer in the negative,\" said Barbicane. \"In her actual state,\nwith her certainly very slight atmosphere, her seas mostly dried up, her\ninsufficient water, her restricted vegetation, her abrupt alternations\nof heat and cold, her nights and days 354 hours long, the moon does not\nappear habitable to me, nor propitious to the development of the animal\nkingdom, nor sufficient for the needs of existence such as we understand\nit.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" answered Nicholl; \"but is not the moon habitable for beings\ndifferently organised to us?\"\n\n\"That question is more difficult to answer,\" replied Barbicane. \"I will\ntry to do it, however, but I ask Nicholl if movement seems to him the\nnecessary result of existence, under no matter what organisation?\"\n\n\"Without the slightest doubt,\" answered Nicholl.\n\n\"Well, then, my worthy companion, my answer will be that we have seen\nthe lunar continent at a distance of 500 yards, and that nothing\nappeared to be moving on the surface of the moon. The presence of no\nmatter what form of humanity would be betrayed by appropriations,\ndifferent constructions, or even ruins. What did we see? Everywhere the\ngeological work of Nature, never the work of man. If, therefore,\nrepresentatives of the animal kingdom exist upon the moon, they have\ntaken refuge in those bottomless cavities which the eye cannot reach.\nAnd I cannot admit that either, for they would have left traces of their\npassage upon the plains which the atmosphere, however slight, covers.\nNow these traces are nowhere visible. Therefore the only hypothesis that\nremains is one of living beings without movement or life.\"\n\n\"You might just as well say living creatures who are not alive.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" answered Barbicane, \"which for us has no meaning.\"\n\n\"Then now we may formulate our opinion,\" said Michel.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Nicholl.\n\n\"Very well,\" resumed Michel Ardan; \"the Scientific Commission, meeting\nin the projectile of the Gun Club, after having supported its arguments\nupon fresh facts lately observed, decides unanimously upon the question\nof the habitability of the moon--'No, the moon is not inhabited.'\"\n\nThis decision was taken down by Barbicane in his notebook, where he had\nalready written the _proc\u00e8s-verbal_ of the sitting of December 6th.\n\n\"Now,\" said Nicholl, \"let us attack the second question, depending on\nthe first. I therefore ask the honourable Commission if the moon is not\nhabitable, has it been inhabited?\"\n\n\"Answer, Citizen Barbicane,\" said Michel Ardan.\n\n\"My friends,\" answered Barbicane, \"I did not undertake this journey to\nform an opinion upon the ancient habitability of our satellite. I may\nadd that my personal observations only confirm me in this opinion. I\nbelieve, I even affirm, that the moon has been inhabited by a human race\norganised like ours, that it has produced animals anatomically formed\nlike terrestrial animals; but I add that these races, human or animal,\nhave had their day, and are for ever extinct.\"\n\n\"Then,\" asked Michel, \"the moon is an older world than the earth?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Barbicane with conviction, \"but a world that has grown\nold more quickly, whose formation and deformation have been more rapid.\nRelatively the organising forces of matter have been much more violent\nin the interior of the moon than in the interior of the celestial globe.\nThe actual state of this disc, broken up, tormented, and swollen, proves\nthis abundantly. In their origin the moon and the earth were only gases.\nThese gases became liquids under different influences, and the solid\nmass was formed afterwards. But it is certain that our globe was gas or\nliquid still when the moon, already solidified by cooling, became\nhabitable.\"\n\n\"I believe that,\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"Then,\" resumed Barbicane, \"it was surrounded by atmosphere. The water\nheld in by the gassy element could not evaporate. Under the influence of\nair, water, light, and heat, solar and central, vegetation took\npossession of these continents prepared for its reception, and certainly\nlife manifested itself about that epoch, for Nature does not spend\nitself in inutilities, and a world so marvellously habitable must have\nbeen inhabited.\"\n\n\"Still,\" answered Nicholl, \"many phenomena inherent to the movements of\nour satellite must have prevented the expansion of the vegetable and\nanimal kingdoms. The days and nights 354 hours long, for example.\"\n\n\"At the terrestrial poles,\" said Michel, \"they last six months.\"\n\n\"That is not a valuable argument, as the poles are not inhabited.\"\n\n\"In the actual state of the moon,\" resumed Barbicane, \"the long nights\nand days create differences of temperature insupportable to the\nconstitution, but it was not so at that epoch of historical times. The\natmosphere enveloped the disc with a fluid mantle. Vapour deposited\nitself in the form of clouds. This natural screen tempered the ardour of\nthe solar lays, and retained the nocturnal radiation. Both light and\nheat could diffuse themselves in the air. Hence there was equilibrium\nbetween the influences which no longer exists now that the atmosphere\nhas almost entirely disappeared. Besides, I shall astonish you--\"\n\n\"Astonish us?\" said Michel Ardan.\n\n\"But I believe that at the epoch when the moon was inhabited the nights\nand days did not last 354 hours!\"\n\n\"Why so?\" asked Nicholl quickly.\n\n\"Because it is very probable that then the moon's movement of rotation\non her axis was not equal to her movement of revolution, an equality\nwhich puts every point of the lunar disc under the action of the solar\nrays for fifteen days.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" answered Nicholl; \"but why should not these movements have\nbeen equal, since they are so actually?\"\n\n\"Because that equality has only been determined by terrestrial\nattraction. Now, how do we know that this attraction was powerful enough\nto influence the movements of the moon at the epoch the earth was still\nfluid?\"\n\n\"True,\" replied Nicholl; \"and who can say that the moon has always been\nthe earth's satellite?\"\n\n\"And who can say,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"that the moon did not exist\nbefore the earth?\"\n\nImagination began to wander in the indefinite field of hypotheses.\nBarbicane wished to hold them in.\n\n\"Those,\" said he, \"are speculations too high, problems really insoluble.\nDo not let us enter into them. Let us only admit the insufficiency of\nprimordial attraction, and then by the inequality of rotation and\nrevolution days and nights could succeed each other upon the moon as\nthey do upon the earth. Besides, even under those conditions life was\npossible.\"\n\n\"Then,\" asked Michel Ardan, \"humanity has quite disappeared from the\nmoon?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Barbicane, \"after having, doubtless, existed for\nthousands of centuries. Then gradually the atmosphere becoming rarefied,\nthe disc will again be uninhabitable like the terrestrial globe will one\nday become by cooling.\"\n\n\"By cooling?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered Barbicane. \"As the interior fires became\nextinguished the incandescent matter was concentrated and the lunar disc\nbecame cool. By degrees the consequences of this phenomenon came\nabout--the disappearance of organic beings and the disappearance of\nvegetation. Soon the atmosphere became rarefied, and was probably drawn\naway by terrestrial attraction; the breathable air disappeared, and so\ndid water by evaporation. At that epoch the moon became uninhabitable,\nand was no longer inhabited. It was a dead world like it is to-day.\"\n\n\"And you say that the like fate is reserved for the earth?\"\n\n\"Very probably.\"\n\n\"But when?\"\n\n\"When the cooling of its crust will have made it uninhabitable.\"\n\n\"Has the time it will take our unfortunate globe to melt been\ncalculated?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"And you know the reason?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Then tell us, sulky _savant_--you make me boil with impatience.\"\n\n\"Well, my worthy Michel,\" answered Barbicane tranquilly, \"it is well\nknown what diminution of temperature the earth suffers in the lapse of a\ncentury. Now, according to certain calculations, that average\ntemperature will be brought down to zero after a period of 400,000\nyears!\"\n\n\"Four hundred thousand years!\" exclaimed Michel. \"Ah! I breathe again! I\nwas really frightened. I imagined from listening to you that we had only\nfifty thousand years to live!\"\n\nBarbicane and Nicholl could not help laughing at their companion's\nuneasiness. Then Nicholl, who wanted to have done with it, reminded them\nof the second question to be settled.\n\n\"Has the moon been inhabited?\" he asked.\n\nThe answer was unanimously in the affirmative.\n\nDuring this discussion, fruitful in somewhat hazardous theories,\nalthough it resumed the general ideas of science on the subject, the\nprojectile had run rapidly towards the lunar equator, at the same time\nthat it went farther away from the lunar disc. It had passed the circle\nof Willem, and the 40th parallel, at a distance of 400 miles. Then\nleaving Pitatus to the right, on the 30th degree, it went along the\nsouth of the Sea of Clouds, of which it had already approached the\nnorth. Different amphitheatres appeared confusedly under the white light\nof the full moon--Bouillaud, Purbach, almost square with a central\ncrater, then Arzachel, whose interior mountain shone with indefinable\nbrilliancy.\n\nAt last, as the projectile went farther and farther away, the details\nfaded from the travellers' eyes, the mountains were confounded in the\ndistance, and all that remained of the marvellous, fantastical, and\nwonderful satellite of the earth was the imperishable remembrance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nA STRUGGLE WITH THE IMPOSSIBLE.\n\n\nFor some time Barbicane and his companions, mute and pensive, looked at\nthis world, which they had only seen from a distance, like Moses saw\nCanaan, and from which they were going away for ever. The position of\nthe projectile relatively to the moon was modified, and now its lower\nend was turned towards the earth.\n\nThis change, verified by Barbicane, surprised him greatly. If the bullet\nwas going to gravitate round the satellite in an elliptical orbit, why\nwas not its heaviest part turned towards it like the moon to the earth?\nThere again was an obscure point.\n\nBy watching the progress of the projectile they could see that it was\nfollowing away from the moon an analogous curve to that by which it\napproached her. It was, therefore, describing a very long ellipsis which\nwould probably extend to the point of equal attraction, where the\ninfluences of the earth and her satellite are neutralised.\n\nSuch was the conclusion which Barbicane correctly drew from the facts\nobserved, a conviction which his two friends shared with him.\n\nQuestions immediately began to shower upon him.\n\n\"What will become of us after we have reached the neutral point?\" asked\nMichel Ardan.\n\n\"That is unknown!\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"But we can make suppositions, I suppose?\"\n\n\"We can make two,\" answered Barbicane. \"Either the velocity of the\nprojectile will then be insufficient, and it will remain entirely\nmotionless on that line of double attraction--\"\n\n\"I would rather have the other supposition, whatever it is,\" replied\nMichel.\n\n\"Or the velocity will be sufficient,\" resumed Barbicane, \"and it will\ncontinue its elliptical orbit, and gravitate eternally round the orb of\nnight.\"\n\n\"Not very consoling that revolution,\" said Michel, \"to become the humble\nservants of a moon whom we are in the habit of considering our servant.\nAnd is that the future that awaits us?\"\n\nNeither Barbicane nor Nicholl answered.\n\n\"Why do you not answer?\" asked the impatient Michel.\n\n\"There is nothing to answer,\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"Can nothing be done?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Barbicane. \"Do you pretend to struggle with the\nimpossible?\"\n\n\"Why not? Ought a Frenchman and two Americans to recoil at such a word?\"\n\n\"But what do you want to do?\"\n\n\"Command the motion that is carrying us along!\"\n\n\"Command it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" resumed Michel, getting animated, \"stop it or modify it; use it\nfor the accomplishment of our plans.\"\n\n\"And how, pray?\"\n\n\"That is your business! If artillerymen are not masters of their bullets\nthey are no longer artillerymen. If the projectile commands the gunner,\nthe gunner ought to be rammed instead into the cannon! Fine _savants_,\ntruly! who don't know now what to do after having induced me--\"\n\n\"Induced!\" cried Barbicane and Nicholl. \"Induced! What do you mean by\nthat?\"\n\n\"No recriminations!\" said Michel. \"I do not complain. The journey\npleases me. The bullet suits me. But let us do all that is humanly\npossible to fall somewhere, if only upon the moon.\"\n\n\"We should only be too glad, my worthy Michel,\" answered Barbicane, \"but\nwe have no means of doing it.\"\n\n\"Can we not modify the motion of the projectile?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Nor diminish its speed?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Not even by lightening it like they lighten an overloaded ship?\"\n\n\"What can we throw out?\" answered Nicholl. \"We have no ballast on board.\nAnd besides, it seems to me that a lightened projectile would go on more\nquickly.\"\n\n\"Less quickly,\" said Michel.\n\n\"More quickly,\" replied Nicholl.\n\n\"Neither more nor less quickly,\" answered Barbicane, wishing to make his\ntwo friends agree, \"for we are moving in the void where we cannot take\nspecific weight into account.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan in a determined tone; \"there is only\none thing to do.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Nicholl.\n\n\"Have breakfast,\" imperturbably answered the audacious Frenchman, who\nalways brought that solution to the greatest difficulties.\n\nIn fact, though that operation would have no influence on the direction\nof the projectile, it might be attempted without risk, and even\nsuccessfully from the point of view of the stomach. Decidedly the\namiable Michel had only good ideas.\n\nThey breakfasted, therefore, at 2 a.m., but the hour was not of much\nconsequence. Michel served up his habitual _menu_, crowned by an amiable\nbottle out of his secret cellar. If ideas did not come into their heads\nthe Chambertin of 1863 must be despaired of.\n\nThe meal over, observations began again.\n\nThe objects they had thrown out of the projectile still followed it at\nthe same invariable distance. It was evident that the bullet in its\nmovement of translation round the moon had not passed through any\natmosphere, for the specific weight of these objects would have modified\ntheir respective distances.\n\nThere was nothing to see on the side of the terrestrial globe. The earth\nwas only a day old, having been new at midnight the day before, and two\ndays having to go by before her crescent, disengaged from the solar\nrays, could serve as a clock to the Selenites, as in her movement of\nrotation each of her points always passes the same meridian of the moon\nevery twenty-four hours.\n\nThe spectacle was a different one on the side of the moon; the orb was\nshining in all its splendour amidst innumerable constellations, the rays\nof which could not trouble its purity. Upon the disc the plains again\nwore the sombre tint which is seen from the earth. The rest of the\nnimbus was shining, and amidst the general blaze Tycho stood out like a\nsun.\n\nBarbicane could not manage any way to appreciate the velocity of the\nprojectile, but reasoning demonstrated that this speed must be uniformly\ndiminishing in conformity with the laws of rational mechanics.\n\nIn fact, it being admitted that the bullet would describe an orbit round\nthe moon, that orbit must necessarily be elliptical. Science proves that\nit must be thus. No mobile circulation round any body is an exception to\nthat law. All the orbits described in space are elliptical, those of\nsatellites round their planets, those of planets around their sun, that\nof the sun round the unknown orb that serves as its central pivot. Why\nshould the projectile of the Gun Club escape that natural arrangement?\n\nNow in elliptical orbits attracting bodies always occupy one of the foci\nof the ellipsis. The satellite is, therefore, nearer the body round\nwhich it gravitates at one moment than it is at another. When the earth\nis nearest the sun she is at her perihelion, and at her aphelion when\nmost distant. The moon is nearest the earth at her perigee, and most\ndistant at her apogee. To employ analogous expressions which enrich the\nlanguage of astronomers, if the projectile remained a satellite of the\nmoon, it ought to be said that it is in its \"aposelene\" at its most\ndistant point, and at its \"periselene\" at its nearest.\n\nIn the latter case the projectile ought to attain its maximum of speed,\nin the latter its minimum. Now it was evidently going towards its\n\"aposelene,\" and Barbicane was right in thinking its speed would\ndecrease up to that point, and gradually increase when it would again\ndraw near the moon. That speed even would be absolutely _nil_ if the\npoint was coexistent with that of attraction.\n\nBarbicane studied the consequences of these different situations; he was\ntrying what he could make of them when he was suddenly interrupted by a\ncry from Michel Ardan.\n\n\"I'faith!\" cried Michel, \"what fools we are!\"\n\n\"I don't say we are not,\" answered Barbicane; \"but why?\"\n\n\"Because we have some very simple means of slackening the speed that is\ntaking us away from the moon, and we do not use them.\"\n\n\"And what are those means?\"\n\n\"That of utilising the force of recoil in our rockets.\"\n\n\"Ah, why not?\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"We have not yet utilised that force, it is true,\" said Barbicane, \"but\nwe shall do so.\"\n\n\"When?\" asked Michel.\n\n\"When the time comes. Remark, my friends, that in the position now\noccupied by the projectile, a position still oblique to the lunar disc,\nour rockets, by altering its direction, might take it farther away\ninstead of nearer to the moon. Now I suppose it is the moon you want to\nreach?\"\n\n\"Essentially,\" answered Michel.\n\n\"Wait, then. Through some inexplicable influence the projectile has a\ntendency to let its lower end fall towards the earth. It is probable\nthat at the point of equal attraction its conical summit will be\nrigorously directed towards the moon. At that moment it may be hoped\nthat its speed will be _nil_. That will be the time to act, and under\nthe effort of our rockets we can, perhaps, provoke a direct fall upon\nthe surface of the lunar disc.\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" said Michel.\n\n\"We have not done it yet, and we could not do it as we passed the\nneutral point, because the projectile was still animated with too much\nvelocity.\"\n\n\"Well reasoned out,\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"We must wait patiently,\" said Barbicane, \"and put every chance on our\nside; then, after having despaired so long, I again begin to think we\nshall reach our goal.\"\n\nThis conclusion provoked hurrahs from Michel Ardan. No one of these\ndaring madmen remembered the question they had all answered in the\nnegative--No, the moon is not inhabited! No, the moon is probably not\ninhabitable! And yet they were going to do all they could to reach it.\n\nOne question only now remained to be solved: at what precise moment\nwould the projectile reach that point of equal attraction where the\ntravellers would play their last card?\n\nIn order to calculate that moment to within some seconds Barbicane had\nonly to have recourse to his travelling notes, and to take the different\naltitudes from lunar parallels. Thus the time employed in going over the\ndistance between the neutral point and the South Pole must be equal to\nthe distance which separates the South Pole from the neutral point. The\nhours representing the time it took were carefully noted down, and the\ncalculation became easy.\n\nBarbicane found that this point would be reached by the projectile at 1\na.m. on the 8th of December. It was then 3 a.m. on the 7th of December.\nTherefore, if nothing intervened, the projectile would reach the neutral\npoint in twenty-two hours.\n\nThe rockets had been put in their places to slacken the fall of the\nbullet upon the moon, and now the bold fellows were going to use them to\nprovoke an exactly contrary effect. However that may be, they were\nready, and there was nothing to do but await the moment for setting fire\nto them.\n\n\"As there is nothing to do,\" said Nicholl, \"I have a proposition to\nmake.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Barbicane.\n\n\"I propose we go to sleep.\"\n\n\"That is a nice idea!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan.\n\n\"It is forty hours since we have closed our eyes,\" said Nicholl. \"A few\nhours' sleep would set us up again.\"\n\n\"Never!\" replied Michel.\n\n\"Good,\" said Nicholl; \"every man to his humour--mine is to sleep.\"\n\nAnd lying down on a divan, Nicholl was soon snoring like a forty-eight\npound bullet.\n\n\"Nicholl is a sensible man,\" said Barbicane soon. \"I shall imitate him.\"\n\nA few minutes after he was joining his bass to the captain's baritone.\n\n\"Decidedly,\" said Michel Ardan, when he found himself alone, \"these\npractical people sometimes do have opportune ideas.\"\n\nAnd stretching out his long legs, and folding his long arms under his\nhead, Michel went to sleep too.\n\nBut this slumber could neither be durable nor peaceful. Too many\npreoccupations filled the minds of these three men, and a few hours\nafter, at about 7 a.m., they all three awoke at once.\n\nThe projectile was still moving away from the moon, inclining its\nconical summit more and more towards her. This phenomenon was\ninexplicable at present, but it fortunately aided the designs of\nBarbicane.\n\nAnother seventeen hours and the time for action would have come.\n\nThat day seemed long. However bold they might be, the travellers felt\nmuch anxiety at the approach of the minute that was to decide\neverything, either their fall upon the moon or their imprisonment in an\nimmutable orbit. They therefore counted the hours, which went too slowly\nfor them, Barbicane and Nicholl obstinately plunged in calculations,\nMichel walking up and down the narrow space between the walls\ncontemplating with longing eye the impassible moon.\n\nSometimes thoughts of the earth passed through their minds. They saw\nagain their friends of the Gun Club, and the dearest of them all, J.T.\nMaston. At that moment the honourable secretary must have been occupying\nhis post on the Rocky Mountains. If he should perceive the projectile\nupon the mirror of his gigantic telescope what would he think? After\nhaving seen it disappear behind the south pole of the moon, they would\nsee it reappear at the north! It was, therefore, the satellite of a\nsatellite! Had J.T. Maston sent that unexpected announcement into the\nworld? Was this to be the _d\u00e9nouement_ of the great enterprise?\n\nMeanwhile the day passed without incident. Terrestrial midnight came.\nThe 8th of December was about to commence. Another hour and the point of\nequal attraction would be reached. What velocity then animated the\nprojectile? They could form no estimate; but no error could vitiate\nBarbicane's calculations. At 1 a.m. that velocity ought to be and would\nbe _nil_.\n\nBesides, another phenomenon would mark the stopping point of the\nprojectile on the neutral line. In that spot the two attractions,\nterrestrial and lunar, would be annihilated. Objects would not weigh\nanything. This singular fact, which had so curiously surprised Barbicane\nand his companions before, must again come about under identical\ncircumstances. It was at that precise moment they must act.\n\nThe conical summit of the bullet had already sensibly turned towards the\nlunar disc. The projectile was just right for utilising all the recoil\nproduced by setting fire to the apparatus. Chance was therefore in the\ntravellers' favour. If the velocity of the projectile were to be\nabsolutely annihilated upon the neutral point, a given motion, however\nslight, towards the moon would determine its fall.\n\n\"Five minutes to one,\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"Everything is ready,\" answered Michel Ardan, directing his match\ntowards the flame of the gas.\n\n\"Wait!\" said Barbicane, chronometer in hand.\n\nAt that moment weight had no effect. The travellers felt its complete\ndisappearance in themselves. They were near the neutral point if they\nhad not reached it.\n\n\"One o'clock!\" said Barbicane.\n\nMichel Ardan put his match to a contrivance that put all the fuses into\ninstantaneous communication. No detonation was heard outside, where air\nwas wanting, but through the port-lights Barbicane saw the prolonged\nflame, which was immediately extinguished.\n\nThe projectile had a slight shock which was very sensibly felt in the\ninterior.\n\nThe three friends looked, listened, without speaking, hardly breathing.\nThe beating of their hearts might have been heard in the absolute\nsilence.\n\n\"Are we falling?\" asked Michel Ardan at last.\n\n\"No,\" answered Nicholl; \"for the bottom of the projectile has not turned\ntowards the lunar disc!\"\n\nAt that moment Barbicane left his window and turned towards his two\ncompanions. He was frightfully pale, his forehead wrinkled, his lips\ncontracted.\n\n\"We are falling!\" said he.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Michel Ardan, \"upon the moon?\"\n\n\"Upon the earth!\" answered Barbicane.\n\n\"The devil!\" cried Michel Ardan; and he added philosophically, \"when we\nentered the bullet we did not think it would be so difficult to get out\nof it again.\"\n\nIn fact, the frightful fall had begun. The velocity kept by the\nprojectile had sent it beyond the neutral point. The explosion of the\nfuses had not stopped it. That velocity which had carried the projectile\nbeyond the neutral line as it went was destined to do the same upon its\nreturn. The law of physics condemned it, in its elliptical orbit, _to\npass by every point it had already passed_.\n\nIt was a terrible fall from a height of 78,000 leagues, and which no\nsprings could deaden. According to the laws of ballistics the projectile\nwould strike the earth with a velocity equal to that which animated it\nas it left the Columbiad--a velocity of \"16,000 metres in the last\nsecond!\"\n\nAnd in order to give some figures for comparison it has been calculated\nthat an object thrown from the towers of Notre Dame, the altitude of\nwhich is only 200 feet, would reach the pavement with a velocity of 120\nleagues an hour. Here the projectile would strike the earth with a\nvelocity of 57,600 _leagues an hour_.\n\n\"We are lost men,\" said Nicholl coldly.\n\n\"Well, if we die,\" answered Barbicane, with a sort of religious\nenthusiasm, \"the result of our journey will be magnificently enlarged!\nGod will tell us His own secret! In the other life the soul will need\nneither machines nor engines in order to know! It will be identified\nwith eternal wisdom!\"\n\n\"True,\" replied Michel Ardan: \"the other world may well console us for\nthat trifling orb called the moon!\"\n\nBarbicane crossed his arms upon his chest with a movement of sublime\nresignation.\n\n\"God's will be done!\" he said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nTHE SOUNDINGS OF THE SUSQUEHANNA.\n\n\nWell, lieutenant, and what about those soundings?\"\n\n\"I think the operation is almost over, sir. But who would have expected\nto find such a depth so near land, at 100 leagues only from the American\ncoast?\"\n\n\"Yes, Bronsfield, there is a great depression,\" said Captain Blomsberry.\n\"There exists a submarine valley here, hollowed out by Humboldt's\ncurrent, which runs along the coasts of America to the Straits of\nMagellan.\"\n\n\"Those great depths,\" said the lieutenant, \"are not favourable for the\nlaying of telegraph cables. A smooth plateau is the best, like the one\nthe American cable lies on between Valentia and Newfoundland.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, Bronsfield. And, may it please you, lieutenant, where\nare we now?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" answered Bronsfield, \"we have at this moment 21,500 feet of line\nout, and the bullet at the end of the line has not yet touched the\nbottom, for the sounding-lead would have come up again.\"\n\n\"Brook's apparatus is an ingenious one,\" said Captain Blomsberry. \"It\nallows us to obtain very correct soundings.\"\n\n\"Touched!\" cried at that moment one of the forecastle-men who was\nsuperintending the operation.\n\nThe captain and lieutenant went on to the forecastle-deck.\n\n\"What depth are we in?\" asked the captain.\n\n\"Twenty-one thousand seven hundred and sixty-two feet,\" answered the\nlieutenant, writing it down in his pocket-book.\n\n\"Very well, Bronsfield,\" said the captain, \"I will go and mark the\nresult on my chart. Now have the sounding-line brought in--that is a\nwork of several hours. Meanwhile the engineer shall have his fires\nlighted, and we shall be ready to start as soon as you have done. It is\n10 p.m., and with your permission, lieutenant, I shall turn in.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir, certainly!\" answered Lieutenant Bronsfield amiably.\n\nThe captain of the Susquehanna, a worthy man if ever there was one, the\nvery humble servant of his officers, went to his cabin, took his\nbrandy-and-water with many expressions of satisfaction to the steward,\ngot into bed, not before complimenting his servant on the way he made\nbeds, and sank into peaceful slumber.\n\nIt was then 10 p.m. The eleventh day of the month of December was going\nto end in a magnificent night.\n\nThe Susquehanna, a corvette of 500 horse power, of the United States\nNavy, was taking soundings in the Pacific at about a hundred leagues\nfrom the American coast, abreast of that long peninsula on the coast of\nNew Mexico.\n\nThe wind had gradually fallen. There was not the slightest movement in\nthe air. The colours of the corvette hung from the mast motionless and\ninert.\n\nThe captain, Jonathan Blomsberry, cousin-german to Colonel Blomsberry,\none of the Gun Club members who had married a Horschbidden, the\ncaptain's aunt and daughter of an honourable Kentucky merchant--Captain\nBlomsberry could not have wished for better weather to execute the\ndelicate operation of sounding. His corvette had felt nothing of that\ngreat tempest which swept away the clouds heaped up on the Rocky\nMountains, and allowed the course of the famous projectile to be\nobserved. All was going on well, and he did not forget to thank Heaven\nwith all the fervour of a Presbyterian.\n\nThe series of soundings executed by the Susquehanna were intended for\nfinding out the most favourable bottoms for the establishment of a\nsubmarine cable between the Hawaiian Islands and the American coast.\n\nIt was a vast project set on foot by a powerful company. Its director,\nthe intelligent Cyrus Field, meant even to cover all the islands of\nOceania with a vast electric network--an immense enterprise worthy of\nAmerican genius.\n\nIt was to the corvette Susquehanna that the first operations of sounding\nhad been entrusted. During the night from the 11th to the 12th of\nDecember she was exactly in north lat. 27\u00b0 7' and 41\u00b0 37' long., west\nfrom the Washington meridian.\n\nThe moon, then in her last quarter, began to show herself above the\nhorizon.\n\nAfter Captain Blomsberry's departure, Lieutenant Bronsfield and a few\nofficers were together on the poop. As the moon appeared their thoughts\nturned towards that orb which the eyes of a whole hemisphere were then\ncontemplating. The best marine glasses could not have discovered the\nprojectile wandering round the demi-globe, and yet they were all pointed\nat the shining disc which millions of eyes were looking at in the same\nmoment.\n\n\"They started ten days ago,\" then said Lieutenant Bronsfield. \"What can\nhave become of them?\"\n\n\"They have arrived, sir,\" exclaimed a young midshipman, \"and they are\ndoing what all travellers do in a new country, they are looking about\nthem.\"\n\n\"I am certain of it as you say so, my young friend,\" answered Lieutenant\nBronsfield, smiling.\n\n\"Still,\" said another officer, \"their arrival cannot be doubted. The\nprojectile must have reached the moon at the moment she was full, at\nmidnight on the 5th. We are now at the 11th of December; that makes six\ndays. Now in six times twenty-four hours, with no darkness, they have\nhad time to get comfortably settled. It seems to me that I see our brave\ncountrymen encamped at the bottom of a valley, on the borders of a\nSelenite stream, near the projectile, half buried by its fall, amidst\nvolcanic remains, Captain Nicholl beginning his levelling operations,\nPresident Barbicane putting his travelling notes in order, Michel Ardan\nperforming the lunar solitudes with his Londr\u00e8s cigar--\"\n\n\"Oh, it must be so; it is so!\" exclaimed the young midshipman,\nenthusiastic at the ideal description of his superior.\n\n\"I should like to believe it,\" answered Lieutenant Bronsfield, who was\nseldom carried away. \"Unfortunately direct news from the lunar world\nwill always be wanting.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" said the midshipman, \"but cannot President Barbicane\nwrite?\"\n\nA roar of laughter greeted this answer.\n\n\"Not letters,\" answered the young man quickly. \"The post-office has\nnothing to do with that.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you mean the telegraph-office?\" said one of the officers\nironically.\n\n\"Nor that either,\" answered the midshipman, who would not give in. \"But\nit is very easy to establish graphic communication with the earth.\"\n\n\"And how, pray?\"\n\n\"By means of the telescope on Long's Peak. You know that it brings the\nmoon to within two leagues only of the Rocky Mountains, and that it\nallows them to see objects having nine feet of diameter on her surface.\nWell, our industrious friends will construct a gigantic alphabet! They\nwill write words 600 feet long, and sentences a league long, and then\nthey can send up news!\"\n\nThe young midshipman, who certainly had some imagination was loudly\napplauded. Lieutenant Bronsfield himself was convinced that the idea\ncould have been carried out. He added that by sending luminous rays,\ngrouped by means of parabolical mirrors, direct communications could\nalso be established--in fact, these rays would be as visible on the\nsurface of Venus or Mars as the planet Neptune is from the earth. He\nended by saying that the brilliant points already observed on the\nnearest planets might be signals made to the earth. But he said, that\nthough by these means they could have news from the lunar world, they\ncould not send any from the terrestrial world unless the Selenites have\nat their disposition instruments with which to make distant\nobservations.\n\n\"That is evident,\" answered one of the officers, \"but what has become of\nthe travellers? What have they done? What have they seen? That is what\ninterests us. Besides, if the experiment has succeeded, which I do not\ndoubt, it will be done again. The Columbiad is still walled up in the\nsoil of Florida. It is, therefore, now only a question of powder and\nshot, and every time the moon passes the zenith we can send it a cargo\nof visitors.\"\n\n\"It is evident,\" answered Lieutenant Bronsfield, \"that J.T. Maston will\ngo and join his friends one of these days.\"\n\n\"If he will have me,\" exclaimed the midshipman, \"I am ready to go with\nhim.\"\n\n\"Oh, there will be plenty of amateurs, and if they are allowed to go,\nhalf the inhabitants of the earth will soon have emigrated to the moon!\"\n\nThis conversation between the officers of the Susquehanna was kept up\ntill about 1 a.m. It would be impossible to transcribe the overwhelming\nsystems and theories which were emitted by these audacious minds. Since\nBarbicane's attempt it seemed that nothing was impossible to Americans.\nThey had already formed the project of sending, not another commission\nof _savants_, but a whole colony, and a whole army of infantry,\nartillery, and cavalry to conquer the lunar world.\n\nAt 1 a.m. the sounding-line was not all hauled in. Ten thousand feet\nremained out, which would take several more hours to bring in. According\nto the commander's orders the fires had been lighted, and the pressure\nwas going up already. The Susquehanna might have started at once.\n\nAt that very moment--it was 1.17 a.m.--Lieutenant Bronsfield was about\nto leave his watch to turn in when his attention was attracted by a\ndistant and quite unexpected hissing sound.\n\nHis comrades and he at first thought that the hissing came from an\nescape of steam, but upon lifting up his head he found that it was high\nup in the air.\n\nThey had not time to question each other before the hissing became of\nfrightful intensity, and suddenly to their dazzled eyes appeared an\nenormous bolis, inflamed by the rapidity of its course, by its friction\nagainst the atmospheric strata.\n\nThis ignited mass grew huger as it came nearer, and fell with the noise\nof thunder upon the bowsprit of the corvette, which it smashed off close\nto the stem, and vanished in the waves.\n\nA few feet nearer and the Susquehanna would have gone down with all on\nboard.\n\nAt that moment Captain Blomsberry appeared half-clothed, and rushing in\nthe forecastle, where his officers had preceded him--\n\n\"With your permission, gentlemen, what has happened?\" he asked.\n\nAnd the midshipman, making himself the mouthpiece of them all, cried\nout--\n\n\"Commander, it is 'they' come back again.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nJ.T. MASTON CALLED IN.\n\n\nEmotion was great on board the Susquehanna. Officers and sailors forgot\nthe terrible danger they had just been in--the danger of being crushed\nand sunk. They only thought of the catastrophe which terminated the\njourney. Thus, therefore, the moat audacious enterprise of ancient and\nmodern times lost the life of the bold adventurers who had attempted it.\n\n\"It is 'they' come back,\" the young midshipman had said, and they had\nall understood. No one doubted that the bolis was the projectile of the\nGun Club. Opinions were divided about the fate of the travellers.\n\n\"They are dead!\" said one.\n\n\"They are alive,\" answered the other. \"The water is deep here, and the\nshock has been deadened.\"\n\n\"But they will have no air, and will die suffocated!\"\n\n\"Burnt!\" answered the other. \"Their projectile was only an incandescent\nmass as it crossed the atmosphere.\"\n\n\"What does it matter?\" was answered unanimously, \"living or dead they\nmust be brought up from there.\"\n\nMeanwhile Captain Blomsberry had called his officers together, and with\ntheir permission he held a council. Something must be done immediately.\nThe most immediate was to haul up the projectile--a difficult operation,\nbut not an impossible one. But the corvette wanted the necessary\nengines, which would have to be powerful and precise. It was, therefore,\nresolved to put into the nearest port, and to send word to the Gun Club\nabout the fall of the bullet.\n\nThis determination was taken unanimously. The choice of a port was\ndiscussed. The neighbouring coast had no harbour on the 27th degree of\nlatitude. Higher up, above the peninsula of Monterey, was the important\ntown which has given its name to it. But, seated on the confines of a\nveritable desert, it had no telegraphic communication with the interior,\nand electricity alone could spread the important news quickly enough.\n\nSome degrees above lay the bay of San Francisco. Through the capital of\nthe Gold Country communication with the centre of the Union would be\neasy. By putting all steam on, the Susquehanna, in less than two days,\ncould reach the port of San Francisco. She must, therefore, start at\nonce.\n\nThe fires were heaped up, and they could set sail immediately. Two\nthousand fathoms of sounding still remained in the water. Captain\nBlomsberry would not lose precious time in hauling it in, and resolved\nto cut the line.\n\n\"We will fix the end to a buoy,\" said he, \"and the buoy will indicate\nthe exact point where the projectile fell.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" answered Lieutenant Bronsfield, \"we have our exact bearings:\nnorth lat. 27\u00b0 7', and west long. 41\u00b0 37'.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Bronsfield,\" answered the captain; \"with your\npermission, have the line cut.\"\n\nA strong buoy, reinforced by a couple of spars, was thrown out on to\nthe surface of the ocean. The end of the line was solidly struck\nbeneath, and only submitted to the ebb and flow of the surges, so that\nit would not drift much.\n\nAt that moment the engineer came to warn the captain that he had put the\npressure on, and they could start. The captain thanked him for his\nexcellent communication. Then he gave N.N.E. as the route. The corvette\nwas put about, and made for the bay of San Francisco with all steam on.\nIt was then 3 a.m.\n\nTwo hundred leagues to get over was not much for a quick vessel like the\nSusquehanna. It got over that distance in thirty-six hours, and on the\n14th of December, at 1.27 p.m., she would enter the bay of San\nFrancisco.\n\nAt the sight of this vessel of the national navy arriving with all speed\non, her bowsprit gone, and her mainmast propped up, public curiosity was\nsingularly excited. A compact crowd was soon assembled on the quays\nawaiting the landing.\n\nAfter weighing anchor Captain Blomsberry and Lieutenant Bronsfield got\ndown into an eight-oared boat which carried them rapidly to the land.\n\nThey jumped out on the quay.\n\n\"The telegraph-office?\" they asked, without answering one of the\nthousand questions that were showered upon them.\n\nThe port inspector guided them himself to the telegraph-office, amidst\nan immense crowd of curious people.\n\nBlomsberry and Bronsfield went into the office whilst the crowd crushed\nagainst the door.\n\nA few minutes later one message was sent in four different\ndirections:--1st, to the Secretary of the Navy, Washington; 2nd, to the\nVice-President of the Gun Club, Baltimore; 3rd, to the Honourable J.T.\nMaston, Long's Peak, Rocky Mountains; 4th, to the Sub-Director of the\nCambridge Observatory, Massachusetts.\n\nIt ran as follows:--\n\n\"In north lat. 20\u00b0 7', and west long. 41\u00b0 37', the projectile of the\nColumbiad fell into the Pacific, on December 12th, at 1.17 am. Send\ninstructions.--BLOMSBERRY, Commander Susquehanna.\"\n\nFive minutes afterwards the whole town of San Francisco knew the\ntidings. Before 6 p.m. the different States of the Union had\nintelligence of the supreme catastrophe. After midnight, through the\ncable, the whole of Europe knew the result of the great American\nenterprise.\n\nIt would be impossible to describe the effect produced throughout the\nworld by the unexpected news.\n\nOn receipt of the telegram the Secretary of the Navy telegraphed to the\nSusquehanna to keep under fire, and wait in the bay of San Francisco.\nShe was to be ready to set sail day or night.\n\nThe Observatory of Cambridge had an extraordinary meeting, and, with the\nserenity which distinguishes scientific bodies, it peacefully discussed\nthe scientific part of the question.\n\nAt the Gun Club there was an explosion. All the artillerymen were\nassembled. The Vice-President, the Honourable Wilcome, was just reading\nthe premature telegram by which Messrs. Maston and Belfast announced\nthat the projectile had just been perceived in the gigantic reflector of\nLong's Peak. This communication informed them also that the bullet,\nretained by the attraction of the moon, was playing the part of\nsub-satellite in the solar world.\n\nThe truth on this subject is now known.\n\nHowever, upon the arrival of Blomsberry's message, which so formally\ncontradicted J.T. Maston's telegram, two parties were formed in the\nbosom of the Gun Club. On the one side were members who admitted the\nfall of the projectile, and consequently the return of the travellers.\nOn the other were those who, holding by the observations at Long's Peak,\nconcluded that the commander of the Susquehanna was mistaken. According\nto the latter, the pretended projectile was only a bolis, nothing but a\nbolis, a shooting star, which in its fall had fractured the corvette.\nTheir argument could not very well be answered, because the velocity\nwith which it was endowed had made its observation very difficult. The\ncommander of the Susquehanna and his officers might certainly have been\nmistaken in good faith. One argument certainly was in their favour: if\nthe projectile had fallen on the earth it must have touched the\nterrestrial spheroid upon the 27th degree of north latitude, and, taking\ninto account the time that had elapsed, and the earth's movement of\nrotation, between the 41st and 42nd degree of west longitude.\n\nHowever that might be, it was unanimously decided in the Gun Club that\nBlomsberry's brother Bilsby and Major Elphinstone should start at once\nfor San Francisco and give their advice about the means of dragging up\nthe projectile from the depths of the ocean.\n\nThese men started without losing an instant, and the railway which was\nsoon to cross the whole of Central America took them to St. Louis, where\nrapid mail-coaches awaited them.\n\nAlmost at the same moment that the Secretary of the Navy, the\nVice-President of the Gun Club, and the Sub-Director of the Observatory\nreceived the telegram from San Francisco, the Honourable J.T. Maston\nfelt the most violent emotion of his whole existence--an emotion not\neven equalled by that he had experienced when his celebrated cannon was\nblown up, and which, like it, nearly cost him his life.\n\nIt will be remembered that the Secretary of the Gun Club had started\nsome minutes after the projectile--and almost as quickly--for the\nstation of Long's Peak in the Rocky Mountains. The learned J. Belfast,\nDirector of the Cambridge Observatory, accompanied him. Arrived at the\nstation the two friends had summarily installed themselves, and no\nlonger left the summit of their enormous telescope.\n\nWe know that this gigantic instrument had been set up on the reflecting\nsystem, called \"front view\" by the English. This arrangement only gave\none reflection of objects, and consequently made the view much clearer.\nThe result was that J.T. Maston and Belfast, whilst observing, were\nstationed in the upper part of the instrument instead of in the lower.\nThey reached it by a twisted staircase, a masterpiece of lightness, and\nbelow them lay the metal, well terminated by the metallic mirror, 280\nfeet deep.\n\nNow it was upon the narrow platform placed round the telescope that the\ntwo _savants_ passed their existence, cursing the daylight which hid the\nmoon from their eyes, and the clouds which obstinately veiled her at\nnight.\n\nWho can depict their delight when, after waiting several days, during\nthe night of December 5th they perceived the vehicle that was carrying\ntheir friends through space? To that delight succeeded deep\ndisappointment when, trusting to incomplete observations, they sent out\nwith their first telegram to the world the erroneous affirmation that\nthe projectile had become a satellite of the moon gravitating in an\nimmutable orbit.\n\nAfter that instant the bullet disappeared behind the invisible disc of\nthe moon. But when it ought to have reappeared on the invisible disc the\nimpatience of J.T. Maston and his no less impatient companion may be\nimagined. At every minute of the night they thought they should see the\nprojectile again, and they did not see it. Hence between them arose\nendless discussions and violent disputes, Belfast affirming that the\nprojectile was not visible, J.T. Maston affirming that any one but a\nblind man could see it.\n\n\"It is the bullet!\" repeated J.T. Maston.\n\n\"No!\" answered Belfast, \"it is an avalanche falling from a lunar\nmountain!\"\n\n\"Well, then, we shall see it to-morrow.\"\n\n\"No, it will be seen no more. It is carried away into space.\"\n\n\"We shall see it, I tell you.\"\n\n\"No, we shall not.\"\n\nAnd while these interjections were being showered like hail, the\nwell-known irritability of the Secretary of the Gun Club constituted a\npermanent danger to the director, Belfast.\n\nTheir existence together would soon have become impossible, but an\nunexpected event cut short these eternal discussions.\n\nDuring the night between the 14th and 15th of December the two\nirreconcilable friends were occupied in observing the lunar disc. J.T.\nMaston was, as usual, saying strong things to the learned Belfast, who\nwas getting angry too. The Secretary of the Gun Club declared for the\nthousandth time that he had just perceived the projectile, adding even\nthat Michel Ardan's face had appeared at one of the port-lights. He was\nemphasising his arguments by a series of gestures which his redoubtable\nhook rendered dangerous.\n\nAt that moment Belfast's servant appeared upon the platform--it was 10\np.m.--and gave him a telegram. It was the message from the Commander of\nthe Susquehanna.\n\nBelfast tore the envelope, read the inclosure, and uttered a cry.\n\n\"What is it?\" said J.T. Maston.\n\n\"It's the bullet!\"\n\n\"What of that?\"\n\n\"It has fallen upon the earth!\"\n\nAnother cry; this time a howl answered him.\n\nHe turned towards J.T. Maston. The unfortunate fellow, leaning\nimprudently over the metal tube, had disappeared down the immense\ntelescope--a fall of 280 feet! Belfast, distracted, rushed towards the\norifice of the reflector.\n\nHe breathed again. J.T. Maston's steel hook had caught in one of the\nprops which maintained the platform of the telescope. He was uttering\nformidable cries.\n\nBelfast called. Help came, and the imprudent secretary was hoisted up,\nnot without trouble.\n\nHe reappeared unhurt at the upper orifice.\n\n\"Suppose I had broken the mirror?\" said he.\n\n\"You would have paid for it,\" answered Belfast severely.\n\n\"And where has the infernal bullet fallen?\" asked J.T. Maston.\n\n\"Into the Pacific.\"\n\n\"Let us start at once.\"\n\nA quarter of an hour afterwards the two learned friends were descending\nthe slope of the Rocky Mountains, and two days afterwards they reached\nSan Francisco at the same time as their friends of the Gun Club, having\nkilled five horses on the road.\n\nElphinstone, Blomsberry, and Bilsby rushed up to them upon their\narrival.\n\n\"What is to be done?\" they exclaimed.\n\n\"The bullet must be fished up,\" answered J.T. Maston, \"and as soon as\npossible!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nPICKED UP.\n\n\nThe very spot where the projectile had disappeared under the waves was\nexactly known. The instruments for seizing it and bringing it to the\nsurface of the ocean were still wanting. They had to be invented and\nthen manufactured. American engineers could not be embarrassed by such a\ntrifle. The grappling-irons once established and steam helping, they\nwere assured of raising the projectile, notwithstanding its weight,\nwhich diminished the density of the liquid amidst which it was plunged.\n\nBut it was not enough to fish up the bullet. It was necessary to act\npromptly in the interest of the travellers. No one doubted that they\nwere still living.\n\n\"Yes,\" repeated J.T. Maston incessantly, whose confidence inspired\neverybody, \"our friends are clever fellows, and they cannot have fallen\nlike imbeciles. They are alive, alive and well, but we must make haste\nin order to find them so. He had no anxiety about provisions and water.\nThey had enough for a long time! But air!--air would soon fail them.\nThen they must make haste!\"\n\nAnd they did make haste. They prepared the Susquehanna for her new\ndestination. Her powerful engines were arranged to be used for the\nhauling machines. The aluminium projectile only weighed 19,250 lbs., a\nmuch less weight than that of the transatlantic cable, which was picked\nup under similar circumstances. The only difficulty lay in the smooth\nsides of the cylindro-conical bullet, which made it difficult to\ngrapple.\n\nWith that end in view the engineer Murchison, summoned to San Francisco,\ncaused enormous grappling-irons to be fitted upon an automatical system\nwhich would not let the projectile go again if they succeeded in seizing\nit with their powerful pincers. He also had some diving-dresses\nprepared, which, by their impermeable and resisting texture, allowed\ndivers to survey the bottom of the sea. He likewise embarked on board\nthe Susquehanna apparatuses for compressed air, very ingeniously\ncontrived. They were veritable rooms, with port-lights in them, and\nwhich, by introducing the water into certain compartments, could be sunk\nto great depths. These apparatuses were already at San Francisco, where\nthey had been used in the construction of a submarine dyke. This was\nfortunate, for there would not have been time to make them.\n\nYet notwithstanding the perfection of the apparatus, notwithstanding the\ningenuity of the _savants_ who were to use them, the success of the\noperation was anything but assured. Fishing up a bullet from 20,000 feet\nunder water must be an uncertain operation. And even if the bullet\nshould again be brought to the surface, how had the travellers borne the\nterrible shock that even 20,000 feet of water would not sufficiently\ndeaden?\n\nIn short, everything must be done quickly. J.T. Maston hurried on his\nworkmen day and night. He was ready either to buckle on the diver's\ndress or to try the air-apparatus in order to find his courageous\nfriends.\n\nStill, notwithstanding the diligence with which the different machines\nwere got ready, notwithstanding the considerable sums which were placed\nat the disposition of the Gun Club by the Government of the Union, five\nlong days (five centuries) went by before the preparations were\ncompleted. During that time public opinion was excited to the highest\npoint. Telegrams were incessantly exchanged all over the world through\nthe electric wires and cables. The saving of Barbicane, Nicholl, and\nMichel Ardan became an international business. All the nations that had\nsubscribed to the enterprise of the Gun Club were equally interested in\nthe safety of the travellers.\n\nAt last the grappling-chains, air-chambers, and automatic\ngrappling-irons were embarked on board the Susquehanna. J.T. Maston, the\nengineer Murchison, and the Gun Club delegates already occupied their\ncabins. There was nothing to do but to start.\n\nOn the 21st of December, at 8 p.m., the corvette set sail on a calm sea\nwith a rather cold north-east wind blowing. All the population of San\nFrancisco crowded on to the quays, mute and anxious, reserving its\nhurrahs for the return.\n\nThe steam was put on to its maximum of tension, and the screw of the\nSusquehanna carried it rapidly out of the bay.\n\nIt would be useless to relate the conversations on board amongst the\nofficers, sailors, and passengers. All these men had but one thought.\nTheir hearts all beat with the same emotion. What were Barbicane and his\ncompanions doing whilst they were hastening to their succour? What had\nbecome of them? Had they been able to attempt some audacious manoeuvre\nto recover their liberty? No one could say. The truth is that any\nattempt would have failed. Sunk to nearly two leagues under the ocean,\ntheir metal prison would defy any effort of its prisoners.\n\nOn the 23rd of December, at 8 a.m., after a rapid passage, the\nSusquehanna ought to be on the scene of the disaster. They were obliged\nto wait till twelve o'clock to take their exact bearings. The buoy\nfastened on to the sounding-line had not yet been seen.\n\nAt noon Captain Blomsberry, helped by his officers, who controlled the\nobservation, made his point in presence of the delegates of the Gun\nClub. That was an anxious moment. The Susquehanna was found to be at\nsome minutes west of the very spot where the projectile had disappeared\nunder the waves.\n\nThe direction of the corvette was therefore given in view of reaching\nthe precise spot.\n\nAt 12.47 p.m. the buoy was sighted. It was in perfect order, and did not\nseem to have drifted far.\n\n\"At last!\" exclaimed J.T. Maston.\n\n\"Shall we begin?\" asked Captain Blomsberry.\n\n\"Without losing a second,\" answered J.T. Maston.\n\nEvery precaution was taken to keep the corvette perfectly motionless.\n\nBefore trying to grapple the projectile, the engineer, Murchison, wished\nto find out its exact position on the sea-bottom. The submarine\napparatus destined for this search received their provision of air. The\nhandling of these engines is not without danger, for at 20,000 feet\nbelow the surface of the water and under such great pressure they are\nexposed to ruptures the consequences of which would be terrible.\n\nJ.T. Maston, the commander's brother, and the engineer Murchison,\nwithout a thought of these dangers, took their places in the\nair-chambers. The commander, on his foot-bridge, presided over the\noperation, ready to stop or haul in his chains at the least signal. The\nscrew had been taken off, and all the force of the machines upon the\nwindlass would soon have brought up the apparatus on board.\n\nThe descent began at 1.25 p.m., and the chamber, dragged down by its\nreservoirs filled with water, disappeared under the surface of the\nocean.\n\nThe emotion of the officers and sailors on board was now divided between\nthe prisoners in the projectile and the prisoners of the submarine\napparatus. These latter forgot themselves, and, glued to the panes of\nthe port-lights, they attentively observed the liquid masses they were\npassing through.\n\nThe descent was rapid. At 2.17 p.m. J.T. Maston and his companions had\nreached the bottom of the Pacific; but they saw nothing except the arid\ndesert which neither marine flora nor fauna any longer animated. By the\nlight of their lamps, furnished with powerful reflectors, they could\nobserve the dark layers of water in a rather large radius, but the\nprojectile remained invisible in their eyes.\n\nThe impatience of these bold divers could hardly be described. Their\napparatus being in electric communication with the corvette, they made a\nsignal agreed upon, and the Susquehanna carried their chamber over a\nmile of space at one yard from the soil.\n\nThey thus explored all the submarine plain, deceived at every instant by\noptical delusions which cut them to the heart. Here a rock, there a\nswelling of the ground, looked to them like the much-sought-for\nprojectile; then they would soon find out their error and despair again.\n\n\"Where are they? Where can they be?\" cried J.T. Maston.\n\nAnd the poor man called aloud to Nicholl, Barbicane, and Michel Ardan,\nas if his unfortunate friends could have heard him through that\nimpenetrable medium!\n\nThe search went on under those conditions until the vitiated state of\nthe air in the apparatus forced the divers to go up again.\n\nThe hauling in was begun at 6 p.m., and was not terminated before\nmidnight.\n\n\"We will try again to-morrow,\" said J.T. Maston as he stepped on to the\ndeck of the corvette.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Captain Blomsberry.\n\n\"And in another place.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nJ.T. Maston did not yet doubt of his ultimate success, but his\ncompanions, who were no longer intoxicated with the animation of the\nfirst few hours, already took in all the difficulties of the enterprise.\nWhat seemed easy at San Francisco in open ocean appeared almost\nimpossible. The chances of success diminished in a large proportion, and\nit was to chance alone that the finding of the projectile had to be\nleft.\n\nThe next day, the 24th of December, notwithstanding the fatigues of the\npreceding day, operations were resumed. The corvette moved some minutes\nfarther west, and the apparatus, provisioned with air again, took the\nsame explorers to the depths of the ocean.\n\nAll that day was passed in a fruitless search. The bed of the sea was a\ndesert. The day of the 25th brought no result, neither did that of the\n26th.\n\nIt was disheartening. They thought of the unfortunate men shut up for\ntwenty-six days in the projectile. Perhaps they were all feeling the\nfirst symptoms of suffocation, even if they had escaped the dangers of\ntheir fall. The air was getting exhausted, and doubtless with the air\ntheir courage and spirits.\n\n\"The air very likely, but their courage never,\" said J.T. Maston.\n\nOn the 28th, after two days' search, all hope was lost. This bullet was\nan atom in the immensity of the sea! They must give up the hope of\nfinding it.\n\nStill J.T. Maston would not hear about leaving. He would not abandon the\nplace without having at least found the tomb of his friends. But Captain\nBlomsberry could not stay on obstinately, and notwithstanding the\nopposition of the worthy secretary, he was obliged to give orders to set\nsail.\n\nOn the 29th of December, at 9 a.m., the Susquehanna, heading north-east,\nbegan to return to the bay of San Francisco.\n\nIt was 10 a.m. The corvette was leaving slowly and as if with regret the\nscene of the catastrophe, when the sailor at the masthead, who was on\nthe look-out, called out all at once--\n\n\"A buoy on the lee bow!\"\n\nThe officers looked in the direction indicated. They saw through their\ntelescopes the object signalled, which did look like one of those buoys\nused for marking the openings of bays or rivers; but, unlike them, a\nflag floating in the wind surmounted a cone which emerged five or six\nfeet. This buoy shone in the sunshine as if made of plates of silver.\n\nThe commander, Blomsberry, J.T. Maston, and the delegates of the Gun\nClub ascended the foot-bridge and examined the object thus drifting on\nthe waves.\n\nAll looked with feverish anxiety, but in silence. None of them dared\nutter the thought that came into all their minds.\n\nThe corvette approached to within two cables' length of the object.\n\nA shudder ran through the whole crew.\n\nThe flag was an American one!\n\nAt that moment a veritable roar was heard. It was the worthy J.T.\nMaston, who had fallen in a heap; forgetting on the one hand that he had\nonly an iron hook for one arm, and on the other that a simple\ngutta-percha cap covered his cranium-box, he had given himself a\nformidable blow.\n\nThey rushed towards him and picked him up. They recalled him to life.\nAnd what were his first words?\n\n\"Ah! triple brutes! quadruple idiots! quintuple boobies that we are!\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\" every one round him exclaimed.\n\n\"What the matter is?\"\n\n\"Speak, can't you?\"\n\n\"It is, imbeciles,\" shouted the terrible secretary, \"it is the bullet\nonly weighs 19,250 lbs!\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"And it displaces 28 tons, or 56,000 lbs., consequently _it floats_!\"\n\nAh! how that worthy man did underline the verb \"to float!\" And it was\nthe truth! All, yes! all these _savants_ had forgotten this fundamental\nlaw, that in consequence of its specific lightness the projectile, after\nhaving been dragged by its fall to the greatest depths of the ocean, had\nnaturally returned to the surface; and now it was floating tranquilly\nwhichever way the wind carried them.\n\nThe boats had been lowered. J.T. Maston and his friends rushed into\nthem. The excitement was at its highest point. All hearts palpitated\nwhilst the boats rowed towards the projectile. What did it contain--the\nliving or the dead? The living. Yes! unless death had struck down\nBarbicane and his companions since they had hoisted the flag!\n\nProfound silence reigned in the boats. All hearts stopped beating. Eyes\nno longer performed their office. One of the port-lights of the\nprojectile was opened. Some pieces of glass remaining in the frame\nproved that it had been broken. This port-light was situated actually\nfive feet above water.\n\nA boat drew alongside--that of J.T. Maston. He rushed to the broken\nwindow.\n\nAt that moment the joyful and clear voice of Michel Ardan was heard\nexclaiming in the accents of victory--\"Double blank, Barbicane, double\nblank!\"\n\nBarbicane, Michel Ardan, and Nicholl were playing at dominoes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nTHE END.\n\n\nIt will be remembered that immense sympathy accompanied the three\ntravellers upon their departure. If the beginning of their enterprise\nhad caused such excitement in the old and new world, what enthusiasm\nmust welcome their return! Would not those millions of spectators who\nhad invaded the Floridian peninsula rush to meet the sublime\nadventurers? Would those legions of foreigners from all points of the\nglobe, now in America, leave the Union without seeing Barbicane,\nNicholl, and Michel Ardan once more? No, and the ardent passion of the\npublic would worthily respond to the grandeur of the enterprise. Human\nbeings who had left the terrestrial spheroid, who had returned after\ntheir strange journey into celestial space, could not fail to be\nreceived like the prophet Elijah when he returned to the earth. To see\nthem first, to hear them afterwards, was the general desire.\n\nThis desire was to be very promptly realised by almost all the\ninhabitants of the Union.\n\nBarbicane, Michel Ardan, Nicholl, and the delegates of the Gun Club\nreturned without delay to Baltimore, and were there received with\nindescribable enthusiasm. The president's travelling notes were ready to\nbe given up for publicity. The _New York Herald_ bought this manuscript\nat a price which is not yet known, but which must have been enormous. In\nfact, during the publication of the _Journey to the Moon_ they printed\n5,000,000 copies of that newspaper. Three days after the travellers'\nreturn to the earth the least details of their expedition were known.\nThe only thing remaining to be done was to see the heroes of this\nsuperhuman enterprise.\n\nThe exploration of Barbicane and his friends around the moon had allowed\nthem to control the different theories about the terrestrial satellite.\nThese _savants_ had observed it _de visu_ and under quite peculiar\ncircumstances. It was now known which systems were to be rejected, which\nadmitted, upon the formation of this orb, its origin, and its\ninhabitability. Its past, present, and future had given up their\nsecrets. What could be objected to conscientious observations made at\nless than forty miles from that curious mountain of Tycho, the strangest\nmountain system of lunar orography? What answers could be made to\n_savants_ who had looked into the dark depths of the amphitheatre of\nPluto? Who could contradict these audacious men whom the hazards of\ntheir enterprise had carried over the invisible disc of the moon, which\nno human eye had ever seen before? It was now their prerogative to\nimpose the limits of that selenographic science which had built up the\nlunar world like Cuvier did the skeleton of a fossil, and to say, \"The\nmoon was this, a world inhabitable and inhabited anterior to the earth!\nThe moon is this, a world now uninhabitable and uninhabited!\"\n\nIn order to welcome the return of the most illustrious of its members\nand his two companions, the Gun Club thought of giving them a banquet;\nbut a banquet worthy of them, worthy of the American people, and under\nsuch circumstances that all the inhabitants of the Union could take a\ndirect part in it.\n\nAll the termini of the railroads in the State were joined together by\nmovable rails. Then, in all the stations hung with the same flags,\ndecorated with the same ornaments, were spread tables uniformly dressed.\nAt a certain time, severely calculated upon electric clocks which beat\nthe seconds at the same instant, the inhabitants were invited to take\ntheir places at the same banquet.\n\nDuring four days, from the 5th to the 9th of January, the trains were\nsuspended like they are on Sundays upon the railways of the Union, and\nall the lines were free.\n\nOne locomotive alone, a very fast engine, dragging a state saloon, had\nthe right of circulating, during these four days, upon the railways of\nthe United States.\n\nThis locomotive, conducted by a stoker and a mechanic, carried, by a\ngreat favour, the Honourable J.T. Maston, Secretary of the Gun Club.\n\nThe saloon was reserved for President Barbicane, Captain Nicholl, and\nMichel Ardan.\n\nThe train left the station of Baltimore upon the whistle of the\nengine-driver amidst the hurrahs and all the admiring interjections of\nthe American language. It went at the speed of eighty leagues an hour.\nBut what was that speed compared to the one with which the three heroes\nhad left the Columbiad?\n\nThus they went from one town to another, finding the population in\ncrowds upon their passage saluting them with the same acclamations, and\nshowering upon them the same \"bravoes.\" They thus travelled over the\neast of the Union through Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts,\nVermont, Maine, and New Brunswick; north and west through New York,\nOhio, Michigan, and Wisconsin; south through Illinois, Missouri,\nArkansas, Texas, and Louisiana; south-east through Alabama and Florida,\nGeorgia, and the Carolinas; they visited the centre through Tennessee,\nKentucky, Virginia, and Indiana; then after the station of Washington\nthey re-entered Baltimore, and during four days they could imagine that\nthe United States of America, seated at one immense banquet, saluted\nthem simultaneously with the same hurrahs.\n\nThis apotheosis was worthy of these heroes, whom fable would have placed\nin the ranks of demigods.\n\nAnd now would this attempt, without precedent in the annals of travels,\nhave any practical result? Would direct communication ever be\nestablished with the moon? Would a service of navigation ever be founded\nacross space for the solar world? Will people ever go from planet to\nplanet, from Jupiter to Mercury, and later on from one star to another,\nfrom the Polar star to Sirius, would a method of locomotion allow of\nvisiting the suns which swarm in the firmament?\n\nNo answer can be given to these questions, but knowing the audacious\ningenuity of the Anglo-Saxon race, no one will be astonished that the\nAmericans tried to turn President Barbicane's experiment to account.\n\nThus some time after the return of the travellers the public received\nwith marked favour the advertisement of a Joint-Stock Company (Limited),\nwith a capital of a hundred million dollars, divided into a hundred\nthousand shares of a thousand dollars each, under the name of _National\nCompany for Interstellar Communication_--President, Barbicane;\nVice-President, Captain Nicholl; Secretary, J.T. Maston; Director,\nMichel Ardan--and as it is customary in America to foresee everything in\nbusiness, even bankruptcy, the Honourable Harry Trollope, Commissary\nJudge, and Francis Dayton were appointed beforehand assignees.\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Moon-Voyage, by Jules Verne\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MOON-VOYAGE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 12901-8.txt or 12901-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/2/9/0/12901/\n\nProduced by Norm Wolcott, Gregory Margo and PG Distributed Proofreaders\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
