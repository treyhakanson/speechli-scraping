Commander\nFrank Jacklin returns to consciousness in New York and is shocked to\nfind himself in the body of Winnie Tompkins, a dissolute stock-broker.\nUnable to explain his real identity, Jacklin attempts to fit into\nTompkins' way of life. Complications develop when Jacklin gets\ninvolved with Tompkins' wife, his red-haired mistress and his luscious\nsecretary. Three too many women for Jacklin to handle.\nHis foreknowledge of the Alaska sinking and other top secret\nmatters plunges him into a mad world of intrigue and excitement in\nWashington--that place where anything can happen and does! Where is the\nreal Tompkins is a mystery explained in the smashing climax.\n\nCompletely delightful, wholly provocative, the Rat Race is a striking\nnovel of the American Scene.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n\nWhen the bomb exploded, U.S.S. Alaska, was steaming westward, under\ncomplete radio silence, somewhere near the international date-line on\nthe Great Circle course south of the Aleutian Islands.\n\nIt was either the second or the third of April, 1945, depending on\nwhether the Alaska, the latest light carrier to be added to American\nnaval forces in the Pacific, had passed the 180th meridian.\n\nI was in the carrier, in fact in the magazine, when the blast\noccurred and I am the only person who can tell how and why the Alaska\ndisappeared without a trace in the Arctic waters west of Adak. I\nhad been assigned by Navy Public Relations to observe and report\non Operation Octopus--the plan to blow up the Jap naval base at\nParamushiro in Kuriles with the Navy's recently developed thorium bomb.\n\nMy name, by the way, is Frank Jacklin, Lieutenant-Commander, U.S.N.R.\nI had been commissioned shortly after Pearl Harbor, as a result of\nmy vigorous editorial crusade on the Hartford (Conn.) Courant to\nAid America by Defending the Allies. I was a life-long Republican\nand a personal friend of Frank Knox, so I had no trouble with Navy\nIntelligence in getting a reserve commission in the summer of 1940.\n(I never told them that I had voted for Roosevelt twice, so I was\nnever subjected to the usual double-check by which the Navy kept its\nofficer-corps purged of subversive taints and doubtful loyalties.) So\nI had a first-rate assignment, by the usual combination of boot-licking\nand \"yessing\" which marks a good P.R.O.\n\nIt was on the first night in Jap waters, after we had cleared the\nradius of the Naval Air Station at Adak, that Professor Chalmis asked\nme to accompany him to the magazine. He said that his orders were to\nmake effective disclosure of the mechanics of the thorium bomb as soon\nas we were clear of the Aleutians. Incidentally, he, I and Alaska's\ncommander, Captain Horatio McAllister, U.S.N., were the only people\naboard who knew the real nature of Operation Octopus. The others had\nbeen alerted, via latrine rumor, that we were engaged in a sneak-raid\non Hokkaido.\n\nThe thorium bomb, Chalmis told me, had been developed by the Navy,\nparallel to other hitherto unsuccessful experiments conducted by the\nArmy with uranium. The thorium bomb utilized atomic energy, on a\nrather low and inefficient basis by scientific standards, but was yet\nsufficiently explosive to destroy a whole city. He proposed to show me\nthe bomb itself, so that I could describe its physical appearance, and\nto brief me on the mechanics of its detonation, leaving to the Navy\nscientists at Washington a fuller report on the whole subject of atomic\nweapons. He had passes, signed by Captain McAllister, to admit us to\nthe magazine and proposed, after supper, that we go to examine his\ngadget.\n\nIt was cold as professional charity on the flight-deck, with sleet\ndriving in from the northwest as the icy wind from Siberia hit the\nmoist air of the Japanese Current. There was a nasty cross-sea and the\nAlaska was wallowing and pounding as she drove towards Paramushiro at a\nsteady 30 knots.\n\n\"You know, Jacklin,\" said Chalmis, as the Marine sentry took our passes\nand admitted us to the magazine, \"I don't like this kind of thing.\"\n\n\"You mean this war?\" I asked, noticing irrelevantly the way the\nelectric light gleamed on his bald head.\n\n\"I mean this thorium bomb,\" he replied. \"I had most to do with\ndeveloping it and now in a couple of days one of these nice tanned\nnaval aviators at the mess will take off with it and drop it on\nParamushiro from an altitude of 30,000 feet. The timer is set to work\nat an altitude of 500 feet and then two or three thousand human beings\nwill cease to exist.\"\n\n\"The Japs aren't human,\" I observed, quoting the Navy.\n\nChalmis looked at me in a strange, staring way.\n\n\"Thank you, Commander,\" he said. \"You have settled my problem. I was\nin doubt as to whether to complete this operation in the name of\nscientific inquiry, but now I see I have no choice. See this!\" he\ncontinued.\n\n\"This\" was a spherical, finned object of aluminum about the size of a\nwatermelon, resting on a gleaming chromium-steel cradle.\n\n\"If I take this ring, Jacklin,\" Chalmis remarked, \"and pull it out,\nthe bomb will explode within five seconds or at 500 feet altitude\nwhichever takes longer. The five seconds is to give the pilot a margin\nof safety in case of accidental release at low altitude. However,\ndropping it from 30,000 feet means that the five seconds elapse before\nthe bomb reaches the level at which it automatically explodes.\"\n\n\"You make me nervous, Professor,\" I objected. \"Can't you explain\nwithout touching it?\"\n\n\"If it exploded now, approximately twenty-four feet below the\nwater-line,\" Chalmis continued, \"it would create an earthquake wave\nwhich could cause damage at Honolulu and would register on the\nseismograph at Fordham University.\"\n\n\"I'll take your word for it,\" I said.\n\n\"So,\" concluded Chalmis, \"if the bomb were to go off now, no one could\nknow what had happened to the Alaska and the Navy--as I know the\nNavy--would decide that thorium bombs were impractical, too dangerous\nto use. And so the human race might be spared a few more years of life.\"\n\n\"Stop it!\" I ordered, lunging forward and grabbing for his arm.\n\nBut it was too late. Chalmis gave a strong pull on the ring. It came\nfree and a slight buzzing sound was heard above the whine of the\nturbines and the thud of the seas against Alaska's bow.\n\n\"You--\" I began. Then I started counting: \"Three--four--fi--\"....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a hand on my shoulder and a voice that kept saying, \"Snap\nout of it!\" I opened bleary eyes to see a familiar figure in uniform\nbending over me. My head ached, my mouth tasted dry and metallic, and I\nfelt strangely heavy around the middle.\n\n\"Hully, Ranty,\" I said. \"Haven't seen you since Kwajalein. What's the\nword? What happened to the Alaska?\"\n\nCommander Tolan, U.S.N.R., who had been in my group in Quonset,\nstraightened up with a laugh. \"When were you ever at Kwajalein,\nWinnie?\" he asked. \"And what's the drip about the Alaska?\"\n\n\"You remember,\" I said. \"That time we went into the Marshalls with the\nSara in forty-three. But what happened to my ship? There was a bomb....\nSay, where am I and what day is it anyway?\"\n\nThere was a burst of laughter from across the room and I turned my\nhead. I seemed to be sitting in a deep, leather arm-chair in a small,\nnicely furnished bar, with sporting-prints on the wall and a group of\nthree clean-shaven, only slightly paunchy middle-aged men, who looked\nlike brokers, standing by the rail staring at me. Tolan was the only\nman in uniform. These couldn't be doctors and what were civilians doing\nin mess....\n\n\"We blew up!\" I insisted. \"Chalmis said....\"\n\n\"You've been dreaming, Winnie,\" drawled one of the brokerish trio. \"You\nwere making horrible noises in your sleep so Ranty went over and woke\nyou up.\"\n\n\"If you want to know where you are,\" remarked another, \"you're in the\nbar of the Pond Club on West 54th Street, as sure as your name is\nWinfred S. Tompkins and this is April 2nd, 1945.\"\n\n\"Winnie Tompkins!\" I exclaimed. \"Why I once knew him quite well. He and\nI were at St. Mark's together, then he went to Harvard and Wall Street\nwhile I went to Yale and broke, so we didn't see much of each other\nafter the depression.\"\n\n\"It's a good gag, Winnie,\" Tolan laughed, \"but now you've had your fun,\nhow about another drink?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Listen, Ranty,\" I begged. \"Tell me what happened.\nI can take it. Are you dead? Are we all dead? Is this supposed to be\nheaven? What's the word?\"\n\n\"That joke's played out,\" said Tolan. \"Here, Tammy, another Scotch and\nsoda for Mr. Tompkins. A double one.\"\n\nTompkins! My head ached. I stood up and walked across the room to study\nmy reflection in the mirror behind the bar. Instead of my painfully\nfamiliar freckled face and skinny frame, I saw a red, full jowled face\nwith bags beneath the watery blue eyes, set on a distinctly portly body\nwhich was cleverly camouflaged as burliness by impeccable tweeds of the\nkind specially made up in London for the American broker's trade.\n\n\"I look like hell!\" I muttered. \"Well, tell me this, Ranty. What\nhappened to Frank Jacklin? Or is that part of the gag?\"\n\nTolan turned and stared at me with an official glitter in his Navy\n(Reserve) eye. \"Jacklin? He _was_ at Kwajalein with me, now that I\nthink of it. A skinny sort of s.o.b., wasn't he?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't say that,\" I hotly rejoined. \"I thought he was a pretty\ndecent sort of guy. Where is he?\"\n\n\"Jacklin? Oh, he got another half-stripe last January and was given\nsome screw-ball assignment which took him out of touch. He'll turn up\nsooner or later, without a scratch; those New Dealers always do.\"\n\n\"Say,\" Tolan added. \"You always did have a Jacklin fixation but you\nnever had a good word to say for the louse. What did he ever do to you,\nanyhow? Ever since I've known you, you've always been griping about\nhim, specially since he got into uniform. Lay off, will you, and give\nus honest hard-drinking guys a chance to get a breath. Period.\"\n\nI took my drink and sipped it attentively. Whatever had happened to me\nsince the thorium bomb burst off Adak, this was Scotch and it was cold,\nso I doubted that this place was Hell. Probably it was all a dream in\nthe last split-second of disintegration.\n\n\"Thanks, Ranty, that feels better. Now I've got to be going.\"\n\n\"Winnie,\" drawled one of the brokers, \"tell us who she is this time.\nYou ought to stop chasing at your age and blood-pressure or let your\nfriends in on the secret.\"\n\n\"This time,\" I said, \"I'm going home.\"\n\nThe steward came around from the bar and helped me into a fine\nfur-lined overcoat which I assumed was the lawful property of Winnie\nTompkins.\n\n\"There were two telephone messages for you, sir, while you were\ndozing,\" he said.\n\n\"Who were they from, Tammy?\"\n\n\"The first one, sir, was from the vet's to say that Ponto--that would\nbe your dog, sir--would recover after all. He was the one that had\ndistemper so bad, wasn't it, sir? I remember you told me that he was\nexpected to die any minute. Well, now, the vet says he will recover.\nThe second call, sir, was from Mrs. Tompkins. She asked if you had left\nfor your home.\"\n\n\"What did you tell her, Tammy?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why, what you told me, sir, of course, when you came in, sir. I said\nthat you hadn't been in all day, but that I would deliver any messages.\"\n\nWait a minute, Jacklin, I said to myself. Let's figure this one out. We\nwere blown up on the Alaska, off the westernmost Aleutians, and now we\nfind ourselves at the Pond Club, in New York City, masquerading in the\nflabby body of Winnie Tompkins. This must be Purgatory, since nobody\nwho has ever been there would call the Pond--or, as the initiates\nprefer, the Puddle--either Heaven or Hell. This is one of those damned\npuzzles designed to test our intelligence. My cue is to turn in the\nbest and most convincing performance as Winnie Tompkins, who has\nundoubtedly been sent to Hell. If we pass, we'll be like the rats the\nscientists send racing through mazes: we'll get the cheese and move\non up. If we flunk, we'll be sent down, as the English say. Ingenious\ndeity, the Manager!\n\n\"Tammy,\" I said, \"will you get me the latest Social Register?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir.\"\n\nI sat down by the door and thumbed through the testament of social\nacceptability as measured in Manhattan. There I was: Winfred S.\n(Sturgis) Tompkins. Born, New York City, April 27, 1898. St. Mark's\nSchool, Southboro, Mass., 1916. Harvard, A. B. 1920. Married: Miss\nGermaine Lewis Schuyler, of New York City, 1936. Clubs: Porcellian,\nPond, Racquet, Harvard, Westchester Country. Residence: \"Pook's Hill,\"\nBedford Hills, N.Y. Office: No. 1 Wall Street, N.Y.C.\n\n\"Thanks, Tammy,\" I said and returned the register to him.\n\nThen I reached inside my coat and pulled out the well-stuffed\npocket-book I found inside the suave tweeds. It was of ostrich-hide\nwith W.S.T. in gold letters on it, and contained--in addition to some\njunk which I didn't bother to examine--sixty-one dollars in small bills\nand a new commutation-ticket between New York City and Bedford Hills,\nN.Y.\n\nSo far, so good. My sense of identity was building up rapidly. I felt\nin my trousers' pocket and found a bunch of keys and about a dollar\nand a half in silver. I peeled a five-dollar bill from the roll in the\npocket-book and handed it to the club steward.\n\n\"This is for you, Tammy, and a happy Easter Monday to you. If anyone\ncalls, you haven't seen me all day.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, sir, I'm sure,\" he said, pocketing the five spot\nwith the effortless ease of a prestidigitator or head-waiter.\n\nI strolled out to the street--dusk was beginning to darken the city\nand already there were lights burning in the office windows--and\nwalked across to the corner of Park Avenue. To my surprise, remembering\nNew York, there were few taxis and those were already occupied. After\nabout five minutes of vain waiting, I remembered reading somewhere\nof the cab shortage in the United States, and walked south to Grand\nCentral. As I turned down Vanderbilt Avenue, I noticed something\nfairly bulky in the pocket of my overcoat. I stopped and dragged out\ntwo expensively tidy packages, with the Tiffany label on them. One was\ninscribed \"For Jimmie\" and the other \"For Virginia.\"\n\nThis represented a new puzzle--perhaps a trap--so I paid a dime for\nthe use of one of the pay-toilets in the Terminal and unwrapped my\nfind. The one marked for \"Jimmie\"--who might be, I guessed, my wife\nGermaine--was a neat little solid gold bracelet, the sort of thing you\ngive your eldest niece on graduation day. The one marked \"Virginia\"\ncontained a diamond-brooch of the kind all too rarely given to a girl\nfor any good reason.\n\n\"Uh-uh!\" I shook my head. Whoever \"Virginia\" might be, she was\nobviously not my wife and the Social Register had not mentioned any\nchildren, ex-wives or such appertaining to Winnie Tompkins. And you\ndon't give diamonds to your aged aunt or your mother-in-law. We can't\nhave Winnie start off his new life by palming off mere gold on his\nwedded wife and diamonds on the Other Woman, I decided. So I switched\nthe labels on the packages and returned to circulation in time to\ncatch the 4:45 Westchester Express.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHere, I resorted to a low subterfuge. Instead of the broker's bible,\n\"The New York Sun,\" with its dim view of all that had happened to the\ncommuting public since 1932, I was coward enough to disguise myself by\nbuying a copy of \"P.M.\" in order to lessen the risk of being recognized\nby fellow-passengers whom I certainly would not know by sight. I buried\nmy face in that spirited journal, with its dim view of all that had\never happened outside the Soviet Union, as I slunk past the Club Car,\nand did not fully emerge from its gallant defense of the Negro and the\nJew until I was in the smoker, directly behind the baggage compartment.\nThe train was fairly crowded but I was able to find a seat far forward\nwhere few passengers could see my face. I decided that my strategy had\nbeen sound when the conductor, on punching my ticket, remarked: \"See\nyou're not using the Club Car today, Mr. Tompkins. Shall I tell Mr.\nSnyder not to wait for you for gin rummy?\"\n\n\"Don't tell him a thing, please,\" I begged. \"I'm feeling done in--a\nfriend of mine was just killed in the Pacific--and I don't want to be\nbothered.\"\n\nHe clucked consolingly and passed on. I was lucky enough to reach\nBedford Hills without other encounters and walked along the darkened\nplatform until I spied a taxicab.\n\n\"Can you drive me out to my place?\" I asked the driver.\n\n\"Sure, Mr. Tompkins. Glad to,\" he replied. \"Goin' to leave your coop\ndown here?\"\n\nI nodded. \"Yep. I'm too damned tired to drive home. Got any other\npassengers?\"\n\n\"Only a couple of maids from the Milgrim place,\" he said, \"but we can\ndrop you first and let them off afterwards if you're feelin' low.\"\n\n\"Hell, no!\" I insisted. \"This is a free country--first come first\nserved. You can drive me on to Pook's Hill after you've left them at\nthe Milgrim's. Perhaps they'd get in trouble if they were delayed.\"\n\nThe driver looked surprised and rather relieved.\n\n\"Haven't heard of any employers firin' maids in these parts since\nWilkie was a candidate,\" he said.\n\nI climbed into the cab, across the rather shapely legs and domestic\nlaps of two attractive-looking girls who murmured vaguely at me and\nthen resumed a discussion of the awful cost of hair-do's. I felt\nrather pleased with myself. I seemed to have won at least one man's\napproval in the opening stages of my celestial rat-race. Now for my\nfirst meeting with the woman whom I had married nearly ten years ago,\naccording to the Social Register. Surely she would recognize that there\nwas something radically wrong with her husband before I had been five\nminutes at Pook's Hill. Why! I wouldn't know where the lavatory was,\nlet alone her bedroom, and what should I call the maid who answered the\ndoor, assuming we had a maid?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\nA pretty, dark-haired maid opened the door of \"Pook's Hill\" with a\ntwitch of the hip that was wasted on Bedford Hills.\n\n\"Oh, it's you!\" She remarked conversationally. \"Shall I tell Mrs.\nTompkins you are here?\"\n\n\"And why not?\" I asked.\n\nShe looked at me slant-eyed. \"Why not, sir? She must have forgotten to\neat an apple this morning. That's why.\"\n\n\"Where shall I dump my hat and coat, Mary?\" I asked guessing wildly at\nher name. Suburban maids were named Mary as often as not.\n\n\"The name is Myrtle, Mr. Tompkins,\" she replied, and did not bother to\nadd the \"as well you know\" she implied.\n\n\"From now on, Myrtle, you shall be Mary so far as I am concerned. And\nwhere, Mary, shall I leave my hat and coat?\"\n\n\"In the den, sir, of course. Come, I'll lend a hand. You've been\ndrinking again.\"\n\nThe girl moved quite close to me, in helping me off with my things and\nit was only by a distinct effort of will that I refrained from giving\nthat provocative hip the tweak it so openly invited.\n\n\"This way, Mr. Tompkins,\" she said sarcastically, so I rewarded her\nwith a half-hearted smack which brought the requisite \"Oh!\"--you never\ncan tell when you will need a friend below stairs and it was obvious\nthat Winnie, the dog! had been trifling with her young buttocks if not\nher affections. That sort of thing must stop, if I was going to get\nanywhere in my run through the maze. Too abrupt a change in the manners\nand morals of Winfred Tompkins, however, might arouse suspicion.\n\n\"Any news today, Mary?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nothing, sir. The kennels telephoned to say that Ponto had made a\nmiraculous recovery and could come home tomorrow. I had them send word\nto the Club to tell you. And Mrs. Tompkins, as I said, forgot to eat\nher apple.\"\n\nI looked at her. This was a cue. I mustn't miss it.\n\n\"And the doctor didn't keep away?\" I asked.\n\n\"Him? I should say not! Mrs. Tompkins felt quite unsettled right after\nlunch and phoned Dr. Rutherford to come over. He's with her now,\nupstairs, giving her an examination.\" She rolled her eyes significantly\nin the direction of the second story.\n\n\"Wait a few minutes till I catch my breath and get my bearings, Mary,\"\nI said, \"and then tell Mrs. Tompkins most discreetly, if you know what\nI mean, that I have returned and am waiting in my--\" I waved vaguely at\nthe room.\n\n\"In your den, sir,\" she agreed. \"The name is Myrtle.\"\n\nThe den was one of those things I have never attained, perhaps because\nI never wanted to. There was a field-stone fireplace, over which the\nantlered head of a small stag presided with four upturned feet--like a\ncalf in a butcher shop--that held two well dusted shotguns. The walls\nwere lined with books up to a dado--books in sets, with red morocco and\ngilt bindings: Dickens, Thackeray, Surtees, Robert Louis Stevenson,\nDumas, Balzac and similar standard authors--all highly respectable and\nmostly unread. On the table, beside a humidor and cigarette cases, was\na formidable array of unused pipes. Above the shelves, the walls were\nadorned with etchings of ducks: ducks sitting, ducks swimming, ducks\nnesting, ducks flying and ducks hanging dead. It was as though Winnie's\nconscience or attorney had advised him: \"You can't go wrong on ducks,\nold boy!\" Instead, he had gone wild.\n\nIn one corner of the den my unregenerate Navy eye discerned a\nsmall portable bar, with gleaming glasses, decanters and syphons.\nFurther investigation was rewarded by the makings of a very fair\nScotch-and-soda. To my annoyance, the cigarette box contained only de\nluxe Benson & Hedges--it would!--while I am a sucker for Tareytons.\nStill, any cigarette is better than no cigarette. A little mooching\naround the fireplace revealed the switch which turned on an electric\nfire, ingeniously contrived to represent an expensive Manhattan\narchitect's idea of smouldering peat. The whole effect was very cosy in\nthe \"Town and Country\" sense--a gentleman's gun-room--and I had settled\ndown most comfortably on the broad leather divan in front of this\nsynthetic blaze when I was interrupted by an angry, tenor voice.\n\n\"I say, Tompkins,\" soared the voice. \"I thought we had agreed to be\ncivilized about this thing.\"\n\nI raised my head to see a lean, dark-haired, dapper little man, with\na dinky little British Raj mustache and a faint odor of antiseptics,\nglaring at me from the doorway.\n\n\"Dr. Rutherford, I presume!\" I remarked.\n\n\"Yes, Winnie,\" came a pleasant but irritated womanly voice from\nsomewhere behind the doctor, \"and I too would like to know what this\nmeans.\"\n\n\"Is that you, Jimmie?\" I guessed.\n\n\"Of course it's me! Who else did you expect? One of those flashy\nblondes from your office?\"\n\n\"Sh!\" shushed the doctor reprovingly. \"What about Virginia? What have\nyou done with her?\"\n\nThis required serious thought. The glass of Scotch was a good alibi for\namnesia. \"To whom do you refer?\" I asked, putting a slight thickness\ninto my voice.\n\n\"To Virginia, my wife!\" he snapped. \"We agreed--it was understood\nbetween the four of us--\"\n\nI shook my head virtuously. \"I haven't set eyes on her all day,\" I\nsaid. \"I don't know where she is and I refuse to be held responsible\nfor her in any particular. She's your look-out, not mine.\"\n\n\"Why, you!--\" The doctor started forward, menacing me with his surgical\nlittle fists.\n\n\"Wait a minute, Jerry,\" the contralto voice ordered. \"Let me handle\nthis!\"\n\nGermaine Tompkins stepped forward into the room and stood in the\nflickering light of the electric peat. \"Tell me, Winnie,\" she asked,\n\"has anything gone wrong?\"\n\nMy wife was a tall, slim girl, with dark eyes, dark hair parted sleekly\nin the 1860 style, and a cool, slender neck. She was wearing something\nlow-cut in black velvet, with a white cameo brooch at the \"V\" of a\nbodice which suggested a potentially undemure Quakeress. I noticed that\nshe had angry eyes, a sulky mouth and a puzzled expression.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Jimmie,\" I replied, after a good look at her, \"but I have\ndecided that I simply couldn't go through with it.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say--\" Dr. Rutherford began, only to be hushed by\nGermaine. \"Let me handle him, Jerry,\" she whispered. \"You'd better go.\nHe's tight. I'll phone you in the morning.\"\n\n\"All right, if you say so, dear,\" the doctor obeyed.\n\n\"And be sure to send me a bill for this call,\" I added. \"Professional\nservices and what-not. And don't come back to my house without my\npersonal invitation.\"\n\nDr. Rutherford emitted a muttered comment and disappeared into the\ngloom of the hall. My wife followed him and I could hear a series of\nconfused and comforting whispers sending him on his way. I had finished\nmy Scotch and poured myself another before my wife rejoined me.\n\n\"Have a drink?\" I asked.\n\n\"No thank you!\" she snapped.\n\n\"Mad at me?\"\n\n\"What do you think?\" Her tone was cool enough to freeze lava.\n\n\"You have every right to be!\" That answer, I had found by experience,\nwas unanswerable.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked in some bewilderment. \"Yes, thanks, I\nwill have a drink after all. You see, Winnie, after we had talked it\nall over the other night after the Bond Rally Dance and realized how we\nfelt about it all, the four of us decided to be--well--civilized about\nthings. And now--\"\n\n\"I don't feel civilized about my wife,\" I said, pouring her a stiff one.\n\nHer eyes glittered and her cheek was tinged with color. In spite of\nher anger, she responded to the idea of male brutes contesting for her\nfavor.\n\n\"I didn't think you cared a damn,\" she said at last, \"and it's pretty\nlate in the day to make a change now. After all, there is Virginia.\"\n\nThat was the cue to clinch the situation. \"To hell with Virginia!\" I\nannounced. \"I'd rather live with you as your friend than sleep with la\nRutherford in ten thousand beds. I can't help it,\" I added boyishly.\n\nShe leaned forward and sniffed. \"You _have_ been drinking, haven't\nyou?\" she remarked.\n\n\"Of course I have! Today, in town, I suddenly realized what a damn\nfool I'd been to throw away something really fine for something very\nsecond-rate. So I drank. Too much. And the more I drank the more I knew\nthat I was right and that it was here where I belong, with you. If you\ndon't want me to stay, I'll go over to the Country Club for the night.\nI'll even phone Jerry Rutherford for you--him and his moustache--but\nI'm damned if I'll go running back to Virginia. She's not pukka!\"\n(\"How'm I doing?\" I added silently for the benefit of the Master of\nCeremonies.)\n\n\"Well--\" she said, after a long pause. \"Perhaps--It's so mixed\nup--Perhaps you'd better go to bed here and we can talk it over in the\nmorning. All of us.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"I don't want to hold any more mass-meetings on the\nstate of our mutual affections. If you want that tenor tonsil-snatcher,\nyou're welcome to him but I'm damned if I'll be a good sport about\nit. If you insist, I'll buy you a divorce, but I won't marry\nVirginia--that's final!\"\n\nGermaine's face relaxed. She smiled. \"We'll see how things look to you\nin the morning,\" she said.\n\nNow was the time to play the trump card.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" I said. \"I brought home a present for you.\"\n\nI walked over to the hanger in the corner and pulled the Tiffany\npackages from my overcoat pocket.\n\n\"Here you are, Jimmie Tompkins,\" I said, \"with all my alleged love.\"\n\n\"Alleged is right!\" But she picked eagerly at the wrappings and swiftly\nferreted out the diamond brooch. \"Why, Winnie, it's lovely--\" she\nbegan, then whirled on me, her eyes blazing. \"Is this a joke?\" she\ndemanded.\n\n\"Of course not! What's the matter?\"\n\nHer laugh was wild. \"Oh, nothing, Winnie. Nothing at all. It's just\nthat you should have decided to give _me_--on _her_ birthday--a brooch\nwith her initials in diamonds. See them! V.M.R.\"\n\nSo that's the catch, I thought. I should have guessed there would be\nsomething wrong with the set-up and I kicked myself for not having\nbothered to trace out the monogram.\n\n\"Don't you see what I mean,\" I grated, \"or must I spell it out for you?\nSome time back, when we were considering all this civilized swapping\nof husbands and wives, I put in the order at Tiffany's for Virginia's\nbirthday present. Today, when I picked it up, the clerk smirked at\nme--he knows your initials don't begin with V--and I suddenly knew I\ncouldn't go ahead with the whole business. So I brought the brooch back\nto you as a trophy, if you want it. You can do what you like about it.\nIt's yours. You see, Jimmie,\" I added, \"that's the way things are. I'm\nburning all my bridges.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she said. Then after a long pause, she added, \"Ah!\"\n\n\"I don't think,\" she remarked, after another pause, \"that I'll want to\nkeep this and I'm far too fond of Virginia Rutherford to humiliate her.\nI think I'll just take this back to Tiffany's and get something else.\"\n\nSo I had led trumps.\n\n\"Here's something else to be going on with,\" I told her. \"I got this\nfor you, anyhow, win, lose or draw\"--and I produced the gold bracelet.\n\"I thought it would go with that dress and your cameo and--if you still\nwant to wear it--your wedding ring.\"\n\nShe cast quick glances from side to side, like a bird that suspects a\nsnare.\n\n\"It's good,\" she sighed. \"Winnie, it's so good. I guess....\"\n\nThere was a knock at the door. It was Myrtle-Mary.\n\n\"Will the master be staying for dinner, Mrs. Tompkins?\" she asked.\n\n\"Of course I will, Mary,\" I said. \"Is there enough to eat?\"\n\n\"I'll see, sir,\" she replied in a manner which was practically an\ninsult to us both.\n\n\"And keep a civil tongue in your head,\" I added.\n\nShe handed it back to me. \"And keep your hands to yourself, sir,\" she\nsaid as she closed the door.\n\n\"Winnie.\" It was Jimmie's hand restraining me, as I started up.\n\n\"Let her go!\" I said at last. \"It's my fault, I guess. I haven't been\nhappy and I did make a few passes. From now on, I'll try to be a bit\nmore decent and livable. God knows I have plenty to be ashamed of, but\nnothing disgraceful ... I hope.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" my wife began. \"If you....\"\n\nThe telephone rang.\n\nShe picked up the receiver and listened for a moment, frowning.\n\n\"Yes, he's here,\" she said, passing me the instrument.\n\n\"It's for you,\" she observed. \"It's Virginia calling from New York and\nshe sounds _most_ annoyed.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\n\"Winnie!\" The voice that crackled at me over the wire had all the\nimplacable tenderness of a woman who has you in the wrong.\n\n\"Yes, dear!\" I answered automatically, with a passing thought for my\nown lost Dorothy, marooned in Washington with a job in the O.S.S.\n\n\"What _is_ the matter?\" the voice continued, in its litany of angry\npossessiveness. \"What on _earth_ happened to you? I've been waiting for\nyou since three o'clock.\"\n\n\"Where have you been waiting?\"\n\n\"_Here_--of course. In our place. In New York. _Winnie, what's wrong?_\"\n\nNot a pleasant spot to be in, even if it was only part of a trial-run\nin purgatory.\n\n\"It's a bit too hard to explain, Virginia,\" I said, \"but something came\nup and I don't think I can go through with it. In fact, I know I can't\ngo through with it.\"\n\nThere was one of those pauses which make a whole life-time seem like a\nsplit-second.\n\n\"Something came up!\" The voice, now a pantherish contralto, purred\ndangerously. \"Something went down, you mean. You see, Winnie, I've been\ntalking to your friends. Johnny Walker, Black Label, that's what went\ndown. At the Pond Club. Tommy Morgan told me all about it. You went to\nthe Pond, had too much to drink, woke up about four o'clock--one whole\nhour after you had promised to meet me--and woke up talking wildly\nand then staggered out. Now I find you're back in Bedford Hills, and\nit--it's my birthday--\" The voice ended in a choke which might have been\na sob or a paroxysm of feminine fury.\n\nI summoned the old voice of authority, as inculcated at Quonset,\ninto the well-tanned vocal chords of Winfred Tompkins. \"Virginia,\" I\ncommanded, \"just stop making a fool of yourself. I'm sorry I stood you\nup but things have been happening. I just can't go through with it.\nI'll explain when I see you.\"\n\n\"You'd better!\" And the slam of the receiver left my ears ringing.\n\nWhen I turned around, my wife was smiling, with a glint in her eye\nwhich was far from sympathetic.\n\n\"Poor Winnie!\" she observed. \"You'd better stick to your office\nstenographers and not go picking up red-headed married women in\nWestchester. You haven't got a chance.\"\n\nI refilled my glass and hers, in that order--a husbandly gesture which\nput me, I felt, on a solid married basis for the moment.\n\n\"Jimmie,\" I announced. \"I don't need to tell you that I'm an awful\nheel. Now that we've got the wraps off I wish you'd tell me what you\nreally think of me and Virginia.\"\n\nMrs. Tompkins' nostrils flickered slightly. \"I never cared for bulging\nred-heads myself,\" she said. \"When she was at Miss Spence's we called\nher Virgin for short, but not for long. There never was a thing in\npants, up to and including scarecrows, that she wouldn't carry the\ntorch for. When she married Jerry Rutherford it was a great relief to\nher relatives. She had no friends.\"\n\n\"A very succinct summary, for all that it should be written in letters\nof fire,\" I remarked. \"And now what do you think of me?\"\n\nShe took a long sip of her drink and leaned forward. \"You're fat, soft\nand spoiled, Winnie, physically, mentally and morally,\" she began, \"and\nyou know it. If you weren't so stinking rich you'd--well, I don't know.\nThere's something about you that's--Well, after you bought me from my\nparents, I wanted to kill myself and then I sized you up. There's no\nreal harm in you, Winnie, it's not hard to like you, but you never were\nlove's young dream.\"\n\n\"What you say is absolutely on the beam,\" I admitted. \"But while\nwe're on the subject I wouldn't call Jerry Rutherford the answer to a\nmaiden's prayer. That Hollywood doctor type with the swank suburban\npractice and the soft bedroom manner gets me down. He has only three\nideas in the world and all of them begin with 'I'. After the first\nantiseptic raptures you'd have nothing in common but your appendix and\nhe'd want to get away with that--for a consideration.\"\n\nJimmie giggled. \"You forget that he already has it,\" she said. \"That's\nhow I was first attracted to him, under the ether cone. I was sick as a\ndog and he held my hand and told me I was being very brave.\"\n\n\"And sent the hell of a bill to me,\" I added.\n\n\"Well,\" she asked, after a pause. \"What do you really think of me?\"\n\n\"I think, Jimmie, that you're lonely, bored and unhappy. All three are\nmy fault but they are driving you to make a fool of yourself. Nobody\nhas tried to understand you\"--which is catnip for any person of either\nsex, once you get them talking about themselves--\"least of all your\nhusband. You need what other women need--children, a home....\"\n\n\"If this is a build-up for obstetrics, the answer is 'No!'\" she snapped\nangrily.\n\n\"Skip it!\" I urged. \"I'm telling you the truth, not making a pass at\nyou. We can talk some more about you in the morning. In the meantime, I\nthink I'll turn in. I'm very tired, a little tight and I've had a lousy\nday.\"\n\nShe flashed me a curious look. \"Go on up, Winnie,\" she said. \"I'll put\nthese things away. You'll need your strength for the morning, if I know\nVirginia Rutherford.\"\n\nGuided by luck and the smell of pipe tobacco, I found what was\nobviously the Master's Room--with a weird amalgam of etchings of ducks\nand nude girls, including one Zorn, and all the gadgets for making\nsleep as complicated as driving an automobile.\n\nI was awakened in the morning by a hand on my shoulder. It was\nMary-Myrtle.\n\n\"You'd better get up and put on your pyjamas and dressing gown,\" she\nremarked conversationally. \"Dr. Rutherford is downstairs and Mrs.\nRutherford is talking with Mrs. Tompkins in her bedroom.\"\n\n\"Stormy weather?\"\n\n\"I'll say so--and see here--\" she began.\n\n\"Sit down, Mary!\" I ordered.\n\nShe subsided on the edge of the bed and looked at me rebelliously.\n\n\"From now on, Mary,\" I announced, \"things are going to be different\naround here. I won't refer to what is past, because you're old enough\nto know what you're doing and so am I. If you want to stay on and\nreally help me through a hard time, I'll double your wages. If you'd\nrather go--and I wouldn't blame you--I'll pay you six months wages in\nadvance and you can clear out. But I can't be worried about you and\nyour feelings when I have a big problem to clean up here. Will you go\nor stay?\"\n\nThe girl thought for a moment, then rose, straightened her apron and\ngave me the first friendly smile I had received, since my arrival from\nthe Aleutians.\n\n\"I'll stay, Mr. Tompkins,\" she said. \"And here's a pick-me-up I mixed\nfor you. Better drink it before you see the Rutherfords.\"\n\n\"Okay!\" And I drank it and it worked its beneficent will upon me. \"Now\nI'll go and kill Dr. Rutherford, if you'll toss me my flit-gun and,\nthanks!\"\n\nDr. Rutherford was pacing, with surgical precision, up and down my den.\nHe looked slightly more self-possessed than the day before and seemed\nto be in excellent physical condition. I guessed at the contour beneath\nmy wadded black silk dressing gown and re-considered my original\nplan to throw him bodily out of the house for having come without my\ninvitation.\n\n\"See here, Tompkins,\" he said briskly. \"We're both men of the world, I\nhope. Things can't go on like this. I was up all night with Virginia.\nYou're not behaving at all well, you know, old man.\"\n\nI sat down in the corner of the leather lounge and looked up at him--a\nmove which gave me a slight advantage of position in dealing with the\nhigher emotions.\n\n\"Let's not mince words, Jerry,\" I said. \"Suppose you just state frankly\nwhat you think we should do.\"\n\n\"Germaine loves me and does not love you,\" Rutherford stated crisply.\n\"You love Virginia and she loves you. None of us wish a divorce. Hang\nit all, Winnie, we're civilized. These things happen, you know, and we\nmight just as well face them. We agreed that the four of us should do\nas we liked, and no hard feelings.\"\n\nI sighed. \"Jerry,\" I said. \"What you say was true as of yesterday noon\nbut if these things can happen, they can also un-happen. Whatever you\nand my wife decide to do is your own affair but I'm damned if I intend\nto allow her to use my home as a place of assignation and I'm damned\nif I'll let her become the subject of gossip. So far as Virginia is\nconcerned, whether or not she is in love with me, I'm no longer in love\nwith her and I'm damned if I'll play gigolo to spare the feelings of a\nbulging red-head who carries the torch for anything in trousers, up to\nand including scarecrows--myself included.\"\n\n\"I can't allow you to talk that way about my wife, Tompkins. It's\nrotten bad form and anyhow we both know that people are the way their\nglands make them and nothing can be done about it.\"\n\n\"Here, have a drink!\" I suggested. \"This is all under the seal of a\nconfessional. I'm not quarreling with you. I'm consulting you. I don't\nlove Virginia and I don't believe I ever did. If you wish to wriggle\nout of your marriage, that's your affair.\"\n\n\"And it's yours, too, ever since that night at the War Bond Ball,\" he\nsaid. \"Don't forget that I caught you--\"\n\n\"Rutherford,\" I replied. \"As a medical man you have surely seen far\nworse than that. You can't sue me for alienation of affections, because\nall Bedford Hills is aware of Virginia's glands and because it wouldn't\nhelp your practice. For the rest, I'm willing to listen to anything as\na way out of this mess.\"\n\nHe paused in his precise pacing. \"The four of us will have to talk it\nover,\" he said, \"as soon as I have that drink you offered me.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I agreed. \"The girls are in Jimmie's bedroom. Perhaps you know\nthe way better than I do. I'll follow your lead.\"\n\nGermaine was propped up in a frilly four-poster bed amid a wallow of\nsmall satin cushions. I barely had time to notice that she was wearing\na rather filmy night gown, when I turned to reap the whirl-wind in the\nform of five foot six of red-haired determination and curves.\n\n\"Now, Winnie,\" she commanded. \"What's all this _nonsense_?\"\n\nI caught a tell-tale glimpse of uncharitable diamonds at my wife's\nbreast and hastily averted my eyes from the monogram.\n\n\"Virginia,\" I replied, \"There's nothing wrong. Nothing at all. It was\njust that yesterday I realized that I couldn't go through with it. I\ndon't pretend to be moral but I won't go in for mixed-doubles at my\nage. It's undignified.\"\n\n\"What!\" Mrs. Rutherford's mouth hung open in amazement.\n\n\"Only this, Virginia. Whatever I have been in the past, I'm going to\ntry to be different in the future. I know it's hard on you but--\"\n\nThe red-head laughed like tumbrils rolling to the guillotine. \"Nothing\nto what a breach of promise suit would be to you, Winnie dear. Don't\nforget I have your letters.\"\n\n\"Now we're getting somewhere,\" I remarked. \"How much?\"\n\n\"Winnie!\" my wife gasped. \"It's blackmail!\"\n\n\"Of course it's blackmail,\" I agreed, \"and there are times when it's\nwiser to pay than to fight. This is not one of them. Virginia, I'm not\ninterested in buying back those letters. Save them for a rainy day. I'm\ngoing to settle with your husband. How about it, Jerry?\"\n\n\"You swine!\" Mrs. Rutherford was going definitely Grade-B in the\npinches. \"Do you think that you can drive a wedge between me and my\nhusband?\"\n\n\"No, my wife has already done that for me. He loves her and he tells me\nthat she loves him. I've told him that they're welcome to a divorce but\nI won't have my house used for any hanky-panky and won't have people\ngossip about Germaine. They can make up their minds what they want to\ndo about it.\"\n\n\"You were saying downstairs, Tompkins,\" the doctor hastily\ninterrupted, \"that you would listen to any reasonable offer.\"\n\n\"Check! What's your price?\"\n\n\"I want out,\" said Dr. Rutherford. \"Lend me the value of a year's\npractice--fifteen thousand would cover it--and I'll get in a substitute\nand take a crack at the Army Medical Corps. They've been after me for a\ncouple of years.\"\n\n\"Done!\" I said, \"and if you like I'll have the bank dole it out to\nVirginia while you're gone, so she won't use it up too fast.\"\n\n\"What about me?\" asked my wife. \"I thought Jerry said he loved me.\"\n\n\"What's _your_ price?\" I asked.\n\nGermaine yawned and the shoulder strap of her gown slipped\nindiscreetly. \"Since nobody seems to want me,\" she declared, \"I'm going\nto stick around and see the fun. I wouldn't miss the sight of Winnie\nTompkins trying to lead a changed life for all the doctors in the\nMedical Corps.\"\n\n\"Me too!\" spat out Mrs. Rutherford. \"There's something pretty\nmysterious going on here and I'm going to stay until I learn all the\nanswers.\"\n\nThere was a tap at the bedroom door and Myrtle appeared, pulling two\nneatly set breakfast trays on a rubber-tired mahogany tea-wagon.\n\n\"I thought you would rather have your breakfast upstairs with the\nMaster, mam,\" she remarked primly, in a far too English country-house\nmanner. \"Breakfast is waiting for Dr. and Mrs. Rutherford in the\ndining-room,\" she added.\n\nAnd as she bent over the table and began to straighten out the\nbreakfast things, the girl had the impudence to slip me a wink.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\nAfter a pleasant breakfast, in the course of which my wife read the\nsocial news in the New York Herald-Tribune and I the business news\nin the New York Times, I excused myself and returned to my bedroom.\nWinnie's bathroom was fitted with all the gadgets, too, and there was\nan abundant choice of razors, from the old-fashioned straight-edge\nsuicide's favorite to the 1941 stream-lined electric Yankee clipper.\nI tried out the scales and found that my involuntary host weighed\nover 195 pounds--a good deal of it around the middle. Oh, well, a few\nweeks of setting up exercises would take care of that. A cold shower\nand a brisk rub made me feel a little more presentable and I climbed\nshamelessly into Winnie's most manly tweeds.\n\n\"Are you catching the ten o'clock, dear?\" Germaine called from her\nbedroom.\n\n\"No such luck!\" I warned her. \"Phone the office, will you, and tell\nthem I'm feeling under the weather and won't be in till sometime\ntomorrow.\"\n\nThis seemed like a good chance to do some exploring--since the\nRutherfords had temporarily abandoned the field--though I needn't have\nbothered since I had seen photographs of suburban houses like Pook's\nHill in a score of different slick-paper pre-war magazines. There was\nthe inevitable colonial-type dining-room, with dark wainscoting below\nsmooth oyster-white plaster, electric candle-sconces, and the necessary\narray of family silver on the antiqued mahogany sideboard. The windows\ngave a vista of brown lawn, with the grass still blasted by winter.\nThere was the inevitable chintzy living-room, with a permanently\nunemployed grand-piano, two or three safely second-rate paintings by\nsafely first-rate defunct foreigners. There was the usual array of\nsofas, easy chairs, small, middle-sized and biggish tables, with lots\nof china ash-trays, and a sizable wood-burning fireplace. Of course,\nyou entered the living-room by two steps down from the front hall and\nthere was a separate up-two-steps-entrance to my den. And sure as death\nand taxes, there was a veritable downstairs lavatory.\n\nI slipped on my coat and hat and stepped out through a French window\nwhich led from the living-room to the inevitable paved stone terrace.\nThere were galvanized iron fittings for a summer awning and in the\ncenter was a cute little bronze sun-dial. This had an exclamation point\nand the inscription, \"Over the Yard-Arm\" at the place where noon should\nbe, and a bronze cocktail glass instead of the sign for four p.m. All\nthe way around the rest of the circle was written in heavy embossed\ncapitals, \"The Hell With It!\"\n\nMy meditations on this facet of the Tompkins character--and I wondered\nwhether I oughtn't to spell 'facet' with a u'--were interrupted by\nMyrtle.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Tompkins,\" she called from the kitchen window, in complete\nrepudiation of her earlier appearance as Watson, third lady's maid at\nBarony Castle, \"the man from the kennels is here with Ponto. Where\nshall I tell him to take the dog?\"\n\nI hurried back indoors--there was still a chill in the air and I really\nprefer my trees with their clothes on--and found a gnarled little man\nwho reeked of saddle-soap and servility.\n\n\"Well, sir, Mr. Tompkins,\" he beamed the Old Retainer at me. \"That\ndog of yours had a close call, a mighty close call. Thought he was a\nsure-enough goner. Tried everything: injections, oxygen, iron lung,\nenema. No dice. Then yesterday afternoon he just lay down and went to\nsleep and I thought, 'My! Won't Mr. Tompkins feel bad!' But he woke\nup, large as life and twice as natural, and began carrying on so that\nI guess he wanted to come home to his folks. He's a mite weak, Mr.\nTompkins, very weak I might say, but he'll get well quicker here than\nat my place and I'll pop in every other day to keep track of him. Never\ndid see anything like the recovery that dog made in all my born days.\nNow about his bowels--\"\n\nI waited until he had to draw a breath and made swift to congratulate\nhim on his professional skill. \"I wouldn't have lost Ponto for a\nthousand dollars,\" I said. \"Let's get him out of your car and up in my\nbedroom,\" I added. \"He's been like a member of the family and--\"\n\nA series of deep bass backs interrupted me, followed by ominous\nsounds of a heavy body hurling itself recklessly around inside a small\nenclosed space.\n\n\"There!\" said the vet. \"He recognized your voice. Come on, Ponto. I'll\nfetch you. He's pretty weak, Mr. Tompkins, but he'll get strong fast if\nyou feed him right.\"\n\nThe vet twinkled out the front door and returned shortly, leading a\nperfectly enormous coal-black Great Dane on a plaited leather leash.\nPonto did not look very weak to me, but I've always been fond of dogs\nand I figured that kindness to animals might count in my favor. \"Good\ndog,\" I condescended. \"Poor old fellow!\"\n\nThe poor old fellow gave a low but hungry growl and lunged for me with\nbared teeth, dragging the vet behind him like a dory behind a fishing\nschooner. I jumped into the den and slammed the door, while Ponto\nsniffed, snapped and grumbled on the far side of my defenses.\n\n\"Tell you what, doctor,\" I called through the panels. \"Take him\nupstairs and put him in my room. It's the one to the right at the head\nof the stairs. He's just excited. Shut him in and as soon as he's\ncalmed down I'll make him comfortable.\"\n\nWhile this rather cowardly solution was being put into effect, I sat\ndown and thought it over. Apparently Winnie had been the kind of man\nwhose pet dog tried to rip his throat out. That was puzzling, since\nfrom what I remembered of him at school, he had if anything been\nonly too amiable. I waited out the vet's last-minute report and\ninstructions, and then rang the bell for the maid.\n\n\"Mary,\" I said, \"will you help the doctor with his hat and coat and\nthen take Ponto a bowl of water. The poor old fellow's had a rough\ntime.\"\n\nThe vet departed and I listened while the maid went upstairs. Then\nthere was a scream, the crash of breaking china and the sound of a door\nbeing slammed. I bounded up the steps to find Mary, white-faced and\ntrembling, looking stupidly at the broken remains of a white china bowl\nand a sizeable puddle of water on the hardwood floor outside my bedroom.\n\nThe door of my wife's room burst open and Jimmie appeared with a wild\n\"What on earth!\"\n\n\"It's that dog, sir,\" gasped Myrtle. \"When I come--came--in with the\nbowl of water like you said, there he was lying on--on--your bed, like\na Human, and--and--\"\n\n\"And what?\" I demanded.\n\n\"And he was wearing your pyjamas, sir,\" she sobbed. \"It's--it's--\"\n\n\"Uncanny,\" Germaine supplied the word.\n\nI gave a hollow laugh. \"He probably remembers that he isn't allowed to\nlie on the beds, Mary, and may have dragged my pyjamas up there to lie\non. Whenever I let him up on the furniture I always make him lie on\nsome of my clothes.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Myrtle said, suddenly calm. \"Is that it? It was just that it\nlooked sort of queer to see his legs in the pyjama trousers.\"\n\n\"Well, don't worry about it now, Myrtle,\" my wife remarked firmly.\n\"I'm not surprised it gave you a shock. He's such a big dog. I'll go in\nand see that he's comfortable. Come on, Winnie! Let's take a look at\nhim. What's the matter?\" she added, noticing a certain reluctance in my\nattitude.\n\n\"Nothing much,\" I martyrized. \"It's only that he flew for my throat\nwhen he got inside the door.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" she replied in the firm tone of a woman who knows better\nand who, in any case, expects her husband not to be afraid of a mere\ninfuriated Great Dane. \"You know Ponto always puts his paws on your\nshoulders and licks your face every morning, as you taught him.\"\n\nMy rollicking laughter was a work of art. \"Of course, that was it,\" I\nagreed, \"and he'd been away from us so long that he was over-eager.\nCome on, let's see if we can't make the poor beast comfortable.\"\n\nBut I let her lead the way.\n\nThe poor beast was lying panting on my still unmade bed. The flowered\nChinese silk pyjamas which I had worn at breakfast were indeed\nstrangely twisted around its gaunt body. The coat was across the\nanimal's shoulders and both of its hind-legs were sticking through one\nof the trouser-legs.\n\n\"There! Ponto! Poor old fellow!\" cooed Jimmie in a voice which would\nhave charmed snails from their shells.\n\nPonto gave a self-pitying whine and his tail thumped the pillow like\nan overseer's whip across the back of Uncle Tom. My wife patted\nthe animal's head and Ponto positively drooled at her. She gently\ndisentangled him from among the pyjamas and hung them up in the closet.\nAs she turned toward the bed, he jumped to the floor, reared up, put\nboth paws on her shoulders and licked her face convulsively, giving\nlittle whines and shiverings.\n\n\"Poor old fellow, poor old Ponto!\" she crooned. \"Was he glad to get\nhome from the nasty old kennel? There!\" And she massaged his ears.\n\"Come on now, Ponto,\" she remarked more authoritatively, \"say good\nmorning to your master.\"\n\nThe answer was a grand diapason of a growl and the baring of a thicket\nof gleaming white fangs in my direction.\n\n\"Ponto!\" she ordered, as the beast positively cringed. \"Say good\nmorning to the master!\"\n\nHe slumped to the floor with the grace of a pole-axed calf and\napproached me slowly, ears back, hair bristling and teeth in evidence.\n\n\"Ponto!\" Germaine's cry was positively totalitarian but the dog lunged\nat me and I barely had time to close the door in its face.\n\nA few minutes later, Germaine emerged looking bewildered. \"I've never\nknown him to behave like this,\" she said. \"I don't like it. It's always\nbeen you he was so fond of and he barely tolerated me. Now he seems all\nmixed-up. After you left, he calmed right down and came back and licked\nmy face all over again. What do you suppose is wrong with him. Can it\nbe fits?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"He doesn't act like fits,\" I said. \"He's had a bad\ngo of distemper and is probably suffering from shock. Dogs do get\nshock, you know. I remember in Psychology at Harvard they told us about\na very intelligent St. Bernard dog which was shocked into complete\nhysteria by the supernatural. That is, they pulled a lamb chop across\nthe floor by a thread concealed in a crack between the boards. The dog\nnearly had heart failure when he saw a chop moving by itself.\"\n\n\"But what can we do?\" she asked. \"Let's send him back to the kennels\nuntil he's cured.\"\n\n\"Nope! From what Dr. Whatsisname--\"\n\n\"Dalrymple.\"\n\n\"From what Dalrymple said, he'd started acting up at the kennels and\nhe--the vet, that is--thought Ponto would be better off at home.\"\n\n\"But we can't have him going for you every time you use your room.\"\n\n\"Then I won't use it. I'll sleep in the guest-room,\" I added swiftly,\nlest she leap to feminine conclusions. \"You might take him another bowl\nof water--he's all right with you--and spread the New York Times on\nthe floor--and a damned good use for it--and bring out my clothes and\nthings. He seems to have quite a leech for you and we'll just leave him\nthere to think things over by himself.\"\n\n\"How about his food?\" she asked. \"Shouldn't he have a special diet?\"\n\n\"No. I'll let him go hungry for a day or so. So long as he has plenty\nof water it won't hurt him. Then when he's weak enough so as not to\nbe dangerous I'll bring him some nice dog-biscuits and warm milk and\nhe'll learn to love me the best way, by the alimentary canal.\"\n\nShe looked at me closely, \"You _do_ look rocky,\" she said. \"You've had\na shock, too. Hadn't I better call the doctor?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No more doctors, please. I'm out of condition, I\nguess, and all this dodging Great Danes is hard on the nerves. I'll go\ndown and mix myself a brandy-and-soda. You might join me when you've\nmoved my things upstairs. We've got to talk over a lot of things.\"\n\nWhen I finally managed to settle down in my den with a stiff drink I\nfelt besieged, bewildered and backed up against the wall. There could\nbe no reasonable doubt about it--_the dog knew_! Ponto knew that I was\nan interloper, that the real Winnie Tompkins no longer existed, that a\nstranger was masquerading in his body and clothes. The uncanny instinct\nof a dog had led him to the truth when even Winnie's wife had been\ndeceived.\n\nThis was a new twist in the maze. I couldn't imagine the Master of\nthe Rat-Race watching with scientific detachment to see whether Frank\nJacklin would make it or would be disqualified in the first round. Of\none thing I was certain, unless I could establish some kind of personal\nunderstanding with Ponto, suspicion would gather around me. For the\nmoment, Germaine did not doubt that I was her husband: my conduct had\npuzzled her but she had lived with Winnie so long that it was probable\nthat she no longer specifically noticed him. Virginia Rutherford would\nbe more dangerous--she was a woman scorned and she had been tricked\nout of an intrigue. She had every motive for digging out or even for\ninventing the truth, but I had given myself a good excuse to keep her\nat arm's length. She couldn't force her way into my clubs. I would\ntell my office staff to keep her away from me, and she couldn't be so\nill-bred as to thrust herself into my home. If I could appease Ponto\nand avoid Virginia, I had a fair chance of getting away with it.\n\n\"Beg pardon, sir!\" It was Myrtle.\n\n\"Yes, Mary?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Rutherford is back, sir. She wants to see you.\"\n\n\"Tell her I am not at home,\" I replied in a clear carrying tone. \"And\nthat I never will be at home to her.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you will.\" It was the red-head. She was wearing a long mink\ncoat and carrying a short automatic pistol. \"Like it or not, Winnie,\n_we_ are going to have a talk--now.\" She turned to the startled maid.\n\"And don't you try phoning the police, Myrtle,\" she added, \"or the\nfirst thing you will hear is this pistol going pop at Mr. Winfred\nTompkins of New York City and Bedford Hills.\"\n\n\"That's all right, Mary,\" I added. \"Don't call the police. Tell\nMrs. Tompkins that I'm busy. Mrs. Rutherford and I wish to have a\nconversation.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\nAs the door to the room slammed convulsively behind Myrtle, Mrs.\nRutherford relaxed, laid the automatic on the sofa between us, and\nflung back her mink coat. She was an appetizing little number, if you\nlike 'em red-haired, well-developed and mad through and through.\n\nInstinctively I started to reach for the gun but was checked by her\nlaugh.\n\n\"Take it, by all means,\" she said. \"It's not loaded. I only needed it\nfor the maid. Tell me, Winnie, have you got her on your string, too?\nThe maid made or undone, as they used to say.\"\n\n\"Virginia,\" I said firmly, \"I told you earlier this morning that we\nwere through. There's nothing more to be said about it. It's finished,\ndone, kaput! All's well that ends.\"\n\nShe laughed again, and looked at me closely. In spite of myself, I\nbegan pulling nervously at the lobe of my left ear, a habit of mine\nwhen confused which has always irritated my Dorothy.\n\n\"There!\" Virginia said finally, \"that's it!\"\n\nHer voice had a note of finality with a touch of total triumph that I\nfound disturbing.\n\n\"Well, have you anything to say?\" I asked.\n\n\"Have _you_ anything to say?\"\n\n\"I've already said it, Virginia. Nice as you are and beautiful as you\nare, we're washed up. It won't work and we both know it. So why not\nshake hands and quit friends?\"\n\nShe took my proffered hand in hers but, instead of shaking it, examined\nit carefully.\n\n\"Very clever,\" she murmured. \"You've even got that little mole at the\nbase of your thumb.\"\n\n\"Of course I have. It's been there since birth.\"\n\n\"Very, _very_, clever, Winnie,\" she continued, \"but it won't do, my\nWinnie, because you see you aren't my Winnie at all. You're a total\nstranger.\"\n\n\"I've changed,\" I admitted. \"I'm trying to be half-way decent.\"\n\n\"Whoever wanted Winnie to be half-way decent?\" she mused. \"Nobody.\nHe was much pleasanter as he was--a rich, friendly boob. As for you,\nwhoever you are, I'm on to your game. You aren't Winfred Tompkins and\nyou know it.\"\n\nI put some heavy sarcasm into my reply. \"How did you ever guess, Mrs.\nRutherford?\"\n\nShe laughed airily, helped herself to a cigarette and leaned forward\nwhile I lighted it so that I could not help seeing deep into the\nstraining V of her blouse.\n\n\"Lots of things. In the first place, you call me 'Virginia' when we're\nalone instead of 'Bozo' as you always used to do.\"\n\n\"I stopped calling you 'Bozo' when I made up my mind--\" I began.\n\n\"Nuts to you, Buddy,\" she rejoined. \"Then you kept pulling at your ear\nas though you were milking a cow, while I was needling you. Winnie\nnever did that. When he was in a spot, he always reached in his pocket\nand jingled his change or, as a desperate measure, twiddled his keys.\"\n\n\"Don't judge my habits by my hang-overs,\" I insisted. \"I'm not feeling\nwell and I've had a sort of psychic shock.\"\n\n\"Winnie never said 'psychic' in his life, poor lamb,\" she observed. \"He\ndidn't know what it meant. No, I don't know what your game is but I'm\non to you and we're going to be real buddies from now on or--\"\n\n\"Or what?\"\n\n\"The police,\" she observed quietly, \"take a dim view of murder in this\nstate. Now I'm willing to be broad-minded. Winnie was a louse who had\nit coming to him, I guess. I was playing him for a quick divorce and\nmarriage. Three million dollars is a lot of money, even in these days,\nand it would have been nice to have been married to it. But it's even\nnicer this way, I guess.\"\n\nThe decanter was within reach. I poured myself another drink. \"Have\nsome?\" I asked.\n\n\"And why not? What's yours is mine, and we both need it.\"\n\n\"Why did you say it was nicer this way, Mrs. Rutherford?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Virginia to you, Winnie. It's because now I don't have to marry you\nand I still have a pipe-line to the Tompkins millions.\"\n\n\"So you _are_ going in for blackmail,\" I observed. \"Suppose I\nthreatened to divorce Jimmie and marry you. After all, I still could.\"\n\n\"A girl has her pride,\" she murmured. \"Not that I'd mind having fun\nwith you, Winnie--as I think I'd better call you. But a wife can't give\ntestimony against her husband and I think I'd rather like to be able to\ngive testimony if needed. Besides, a husband has too many opportunities\nto help the undertaker. There are accidents in bath-tubs and garages,\nmedicines get mixed up in the bathroom cabinet and there is always the\nold-fashioned hatchet. No, since you've managed to get rid of the other\nWinnie, somehow, I think I'll keep a safe distance and my silence, as\nlong as you make it worth my while.\"\n\n\"Suppose I won't play?\" I suggested.\n\n\"Then I'll go to the police or the F.B.I.--they're supposed to catch\nkidnappers, aren't they?--and tell them what I know.\"\n\nI stood up. This would be easier than I had expected.\n\n\"Okay, Virginia,\" I said, \"go right ahead. There's the telephone. You\ncan use it to call the Secret Service for all I care. See what luck you\nhave with your story, when my wife is here to testify that I'm Winnie\nTompkins.\"\n\nHer face paled and her eyes narrowed angrily. \"Jimmie too?\" she asked.\n\"Then you're both in it!\"\n\n\"We're both in what?\"\n\nThe door opened and Germaine Tompkins stood in the entrance.\n\nVirginia Rutherford looked trapped and she instinctively pulled her\nmink back over her shoulders.\n\n\"Nothing, Jimmie,\" she said at last. \"I was foolish enough to hope that\nif I came back and had a talk alone with Winnie, we could pick up\nwhere we left off. He's been acting so strangely that he doesn't seem\nlike himself at all. And so are you. That's what I meant by saying that\nyou were both in it.\"\n\n\"Virginia,\" my wife said firmly, \"my husband told you to stay out of\nthis house--and it's my home, too--and now I find you here. Please go\nor I'll call the police.\"\n\nThe two women exchanged appraising glances which suggested that they\nwere both thoroughly enjoying the touch of melodrama that had come into\ntheir well-fed lives.\n\n\"No, it's my fault for letting her in,\" I said. \"She sent in word by\nMary--\"\n\n\"You mean Myrtle.\"\n\n\"--that she would like to see me. I agreed to do so, so you can't blame\nher. We talked things over and decided that it's all off--a few moments\nof madness, but that's all, and not worth wrecking two marriages for.\nIsn't that so, Mrs. Rutherford?\"\n\nVirginia shook her head. \"No, Winnie, it is not so. Jimmie, I came here\nwith that gun. It wasn't loaded but the next time it will be. I made\nMyrtle or whatever her name is show me in and I told her I would shoot\nWinnie if she gave the alarm. Then I told him what I know about him.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\" my wife asked.\n\n\"That he is not Winnie at all,\" Virginia declared. \"That he is an\nimposter, that he and perhaps you had done away with poor old Winnie. I\ntold him that I wouldn't tell his secret if he paid me to keep silent.\nAnd he told me to call the police.\"\n\nMy wife went over to her and took her hand. \"Poor, darling Virginia,\"\nshe murmured, \"why don't you go away and have a good rest? You've got\nyourself all worked up for a nervous breakdown. Of course it's Winnie.\nI'm married to him and I ought to know my own husband, shouldn't I?\nYou've simply got run down and all, with rationing and war-work. Why\ndon't you let Jerry send you for a few weeks to the Hartford Sanctuary\nfor psychoanalysis and a good rest?\"\n\nVirginia dashed my wife's hand away. \"In other words, you think I'm\ncrazy!\" she snapped.\n\n\"No, but I do think you're hysterical. This is Winnie, I'm Jimmie\nand you're Virginia Rutherford. We've all been letting ourselves get\nover-emotional and this war is a strain on everybody. Don't worry.\nJerry can fix it for you quite easily and I--we both will be glad\nto help pay for it, if you're worried about the money. After all,\"\nGermaine added wryly, \"the whole thing is pretty much of a family\naffair, isn't it? Let's keep it that way.\"\n\nMrs. Rutherford reached over and grabbed the gun from the sofa.\n\n\"All right, Germaine Tompkins, murderess,\" she grated. \"If that's the\nway you're going to play it, I'll play too. Don't worry about my mind.\nStart thinking about the electric chair. Remember, in this state they\nexecute women who kill their husbands.\"\n\nJimmie waited until the door closed behind the doctor's wife. Then she\nturned to me with a curious expression of weariness.\n\n\"Poor man!\" she remarked. \"You have got yourself into a bad mess,\nhaven't you?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"It didn't seem like one while I was getting into it,\" I said. \"It's\nonly now when I'm trying to get things straightened out that it seems\nso awful.\"\n\n\"Let's see,\" she continued. \"How many women is it you've been trying to\nkeep away from each other? There's myself, of course, but wives don't\ncount any more, do they? And there's Virginia Rutherford and Myrtle,\nand there was that blonde actress we met at Martha's Vineyard last\nsummer, and is it one or two girls at the office?\"\n\nHere was where I could object with complete sincerity. \"I swear that\nI've not been fooling with any of the office girls,\" I said.\n\n\"I know,\" Jimmie agreed wisely. \"You always used to tell me that it was\nconsidered bad for business to play with the help but after I saw the\nway you went for Myrtle I decided that there were exceptions to every\nrule.\"\n\n\"Nobody in the office,\" I repeated. \"I swear it.\"\n\n\"Then perhaps it was the office next door. Maybe you brokers have\nan exchange system for taking on each other's stenographers--charge\nit to business expenses for getting information about each other's\ndealings--but I know I've heard the name Briggs mentioned somehow in\nyour connection.\"\n\n\"The name means absolutely nothing to me,\" I insisted. \"If it will make\nyou any happier I'll admit to a hundred women but I'm through with all\nthat sex-stuff. From now on, I'm going to be a one-woman man.\"\n\nGermaine faced me with an air of resolution. \"Would you mind giving me\na drink of brandy?\" she asked. \"I've something to say to you and I'm\nafraid you won't like it.\"\n\nI went to the portable bar and poured her a pony of Courvoisier.\n\n\"Here you are. Down the hatch! And now what is it you want to tell me.\"\n\n\"Believe me, Winnie,\" she said, \"it's not easy for me. But I'd better\nsay it anyhow. I can't keep on suppressing it. Who _are_ you?\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Who _are_ you?\" she repeated. \"You look like my husband but you don't\ntalk like him. His clothes fit you but Virginia Rutherford is _quite_\nright--you aren't Winnie Tompkins.\"\n\n\"How did you guess?\"\n\n\"Don't think I'll give you away,\" she continued. \"I won't because\nyou must have had a terribly important reason for doing whatever you\nhave done. You seem to be in deep trouble of some kind. I--I'd like\nto help you, if I can. Don't think I'm hard on my husband. It's been\nyears since we--oh, you know. I married him for his money and I still\ndon't know why he married me. Yes, I do, but I've never liked to admit\nit. He'd made a lot of money in the market and had built this house.\nHe needed a wife the way he needed an automobile, a portable bar, a\nCapehart, a thoroughbred Great Dane and a membership in the Pond Club.\nI was available, at a price, which he met--but that's all there is to\nour story.\"\n\n\"Poor Jimmie!\" I sympathized. \"We're both lost, I guess. No, I'm not\nWinnie but I don't know who else I could possibly be. You see, less\nthan twenty-four hours ago I was a lieutenant-commander on a light\ncarrier in the North Pacific and--\"\n\nGermaine slowly withdrew her hand from mine.\n\n\"Oh!\" she exclaimed softly. \"Oh Winnie! Poor old idiot! I'll take care\nof you and see that you get over this. Wait, I'll call the doctor right\naway. The Hartford Sanctuary's a very nice place, and I can come over\nevery week to--\"\n\nI shook my head. \"You'll do nothing of the kind, my dear,\" I ordered.\n\"No doctor can help me on this one. Besides,\" I added, \"how do you know\nthat I wasn't batty before and have just come to my senses.\"\n\nHer eyes were frightened. \"All right, dear,\" she agreed. \"I like you\nbetter this way, anyhow.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\n\"Thanks, Jimmie,\" I replied. \"I'm going to try to stay this way.\"\n\nMy wife sat down beside me and studied me closely. \"You _look_\ndifferent,\" she remarked. \"To me, at any rate. You're sort of coming to\na focus. If only--. You're so different and--strange.\"\n\nHere was my chance to recover lost ground.\n\n\"As near as I can make out,\" I said, \"I've had a kind of amnesia. I\nknow you, of course, and my name, and that this is my house and that\nPonto is my dog, even though he tried to bite me. I know the Pond Club\nand the Harvard Club, but that's about all I seem able to remember.\nI can't recall where I work or where I bank, or who my friends are\nor what kind of car I drive or what I was doing before yesterday\nafternoon.\"\n\nShe relaxed at the holy scientific word 'amnesia,' as though to name a\nmystery explained it.\n\n\"But you were saying something about being on an aircraft carrier in\nthe Pacific,\" she objected.\n\nI laughed. \"That must have been part of a very vivid dream I was having\nin a chair in the bar at the Pond, when Ranty Tolan woke me up. It was\none of those dreams which seemed so real that real life seemed like a\ndream. It still does a bit. That's where my alleged mind got stalled\nand I'm still floundering around. Help me, won't you?\"\n\n\"You didn't seem to need much help remembering Virginia Rutherford,\"\nshe remarked, \"but I'll try to fill in some of the gaps for you. You\nhave your own firm--Tompkins, Wasson and Cone--at No. 1 Wall Street.\nIt's sort of combination brokerage office and investment counsel. You\nonce told me that your specialty was finding nice rich old ladies\nand helping them re-invest their unearned millions. You bank at the\nNational City Farmers and your car is a black '41 Packard coupe.\"\n\n\"That helps a lot,\" I thanked her. \"Now how about my friends? If I go\nto town tomorrow, I ought to be on the look-out for them. Business\nisn't so good right now that I can afford to let myself be run in as an\namnesiac while my partners look after the loot.\"\n\nShe frowned. \"I don't know much about your friends in town, since so\nmany of them are in the war,\" she admitted. \"There's Merry Vail, of\ncourse, who roomed with you at Harvard, but he hasn't come out here\nmuch since Adela divorced him after that business in Bermuda. Sometimes\nyou talk about the men you see at the Club but I've never been able\nto keep track of the Phils and Bills and Neds and Joes and Dicks and\nHarrys. You'll have to find your own way there. At the office, of\ncourse, there's Graham Wasson and Phil Cone, your partners, but you\nwon't have much trouble once you're at your desk. Wasson is dark and\nplump and Cone is fair and plump and they're both about five years\nyounger than you are.\"\n\n\"The office doesn't worry me,\" I agreed. \"I can handle anything that\ndevelops there.\"\n\n\"You know, Winnie,\" Jimmie remarked, \"if I were you I wouldn't try to\ngo to town for a few days. The office will run itself and you need a\nrest. I don't know much about amnesia but I've always heard that rest\nand kind treatment--\"\n\n\"Uh-uh!\" I dissented emphatically. \"Worst thing in the world for it.\nI've always heard that the thing to do is to go back over the ground\nuntil you come to the thing that gave you the original shock and then\nit all comes back to you. If I stick around Bedford Hills I'll just get\npanicky over not being sure whether I remember things or not. I'll go\nto town in the morning and see if I can't find myself.\"\n\nShe laughed, as wives laugh. \"You may be a changed man,\" she announced,\n\"but you're still stubborn as a mule. Tell me, to change the subject,\nyou say that you remember me. Tell me what I seem like to you, now\nthat you've changed, as you say, aside from age, sex, scars and\ndistinguishing marks, if any, and marital status.\"\n\nI closed my eyes and thought of Dorothy as she had been that last night\nin Hartford before she walked out and I decided to join the Navy as a\nReserve Officer.\n\n\"You are piano music on a summer night--something Scarlatti or\nMozart--thin, cool, precise, gay. You are apple blossoms against a\nBerkshire hillside. You are the smoke of fallen leaves climbing into\nthe cool October sky. You are surf on a sandy beach, with the gulls\nwheeling and the white-caps racing past the lighthouse on the point.\nYou are bobsleds and hot coffee and dough-nuts by a roaring wood fire.\nAnd you're a lost child, with two pennies in your fist, looking in the\nwindow of a five-cent candy-shop.\"\n\nGermaine relaxed. \"Except for that last bit, Winnie, you made me sound\nlike a year-round vacation resort or an ad for a new automobile. You've\nmentioned almost everything about me except the one thing I obviously\nam.\"\n\n\"Which is?\"\n\n\"A simple, rather stupid woman, I guess,\" Germaine sighed, \"who's had\neverything in life except what she wants.\"\n\n\"All women are simple,\" I pontificated, \"since what they want is\nsimple.\"\n\n\"You moron!\" she blazed. \"Don't you see that no woman knows what she\nwants until she is made to want it. You ... you never made me want\nanything simple, except to crack you over the head with something.\"\n\nAfter she had left, I sat for a long time. There seemed to be nothing\nto do or say. Winnie's domestic life was still in too much of a snarl\nfor me to do the obvious thing and follow Germaine upstairs, and into\nher bedroom, lock the door, and kiss her tear-stained face and tell her\nthat I was sorry I had hurt her.... Before it would be safe to accept\nher gambits I must first explore my business connections. Hadn't my\nwife said something about girls in the office?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy first stop in the morning, after I had been careful to take a late\ncommuting train in to the city in order to avoid business men who were\nsure to know and greet Winnie Tompkins, was the Pond Club.\n\nTammy was behind the bar and as soon as I entered he turned and mixed\nme a powerful pick-me-up. I drained it with the usual convulsive effort\nand then pretended to relax.\n\n\"Thanks, Tammy,\" I said. \"That's what I needed.\" \"Good morning, Mr.\nTompkins,\" he remarked. \"I'm glad to see you back. You were looking a\ntrifle seedy--if you don't mind my saying so, sir--when you were in\nhere Monday afternoon.\"\n\n\"I took a day off in the country and got rested up,\" I told him. \"I\nfeel fine now. Anybody in the Club?\"\n\n\"Not just now, sir. A couple of gentlemen were asking for you yesterday\nafternoon--that would be Tuesday. That was Commander Tolan, sir, and\na friend of his, a Mr. Harcourt his name was, who hasn't been here\nbefore. They asked me if you were at your home but I just laughed.\n'Him gone home?' I said. 'Not while he has a girl and a flat on Park\nAvenue.' Begging your pardon, Mr. Tompkins, I knew you didn't want to\nbe bothered wherever you were and so I said the first thing that came\nto my head.\"\n\n\"You're doing fine, Tammy,\" I assured him. \"I don't want to see anybody\nfor a couple of days. Now then, I'd like you to tell me what happened\nhere Monday afternoon. It's the first time in my life I've ever drawn a\ncomplete blank.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" the Club steward recited. \"You came in about two o'clock\nand sat down in your usual chair--that one in the corner. You said\nsomething about having had lunch at the Harvard Club, sir, and had a\ncouple of Scotch and sodas here.\"\n\n\"Was I tight, Tammy?\"\n\n\"Not to call tight. You didn't show it, and after a time you went to\nsleep, like you was tired out. You was still sleeping when Mr. Morgan,\nMr. Davis and Commander Tolan came in. That would be a little after\nthree o'clock, sir. They made some talk about how you were sleeping\nthrough the noise they made, that it would take a bomb to wake you.\nThen, sir, I guess you had some kind of a dream. You began talking like\nand thrashing with your arms and making noises. So Commander Tolan he\nsaid, 'Jesus we can't drink with that going on' and went and shook you\nby the shoulder until you woke up. You'd been dreaming all right, Mr.\nTompkins, because you talked wild when you woke up, about Alaska and\nwhere were you. The others joked a bit about it after you left but I'd\ntake my oath, sir, that you weren't really what might be called tight,\nMr. Tompkins.\"\n\n\"Thanks a million, Tammy,\" I said. \"That's a load off my mind. I drew\na blank and didn't know where I'd been or what I'd been doing. Can you\nlet me have some money? I'm a bit short of cash.\"\n\n\"Of course, sir. How much will you need?\"\n\n\"A couple of hundred will do,\" I told him, \"if you have that much.\"\n\n\"That will be easy, sir. If you'll just sign a check, like the house\nrules says, I'll get it from the safe.\"\n\nHe nearly caught me. Signing checks was something I simply could not do\nuntil I had learned to imitate Winnie Tompkins' signature. I had tried\nin the guest-room at Bedford Hills, the previous evening, and found\nthat my original signature as Frank E. Jacklin was completely unchanged\nby my transmigration, and that my own copy-desk scrawl was the only\nhandwriting I could commit. I had burned the note-paper on which I had\nmade the crucial experiments and flushed the ashes down the toilet. One\nof my objects in coming to the Pond had been to see if I couldn't get\nmoney by simply initialing a chit.\n\nI hastily looked in my bill-fold. There was still a fair amount of\nmoney left. It would last me until I found a way to draw on Winnie's\nbank-account.\n\n\"Never mind, after all,\" I told Tammy. \"I guess I have enough to last\nme until I get down to the office. If anybody asks for me, you haven't\nseen me since Monday and don't know where I am.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir,\" he agreed. \"I'll take any messages that come for you,\nsir, and not let on I've set eyes on you.\"\n\nMy next stop was at an old hang-out of mine and Dorothy's from my\nearly newspaper days: a place on East 53rd Street, where you can get\na good meal if you have the money to pay for it and the time to wait\nfor it--and I had both. I knew that none of Winnie's friends would be\nseen dead in the place and I didn't want to try lunch at the Harvard\nClub, where I'd have to sign the dining-room order or the bar-check.\nThe place was reasonably uncrowded--it was not quite noon--and I had a\npleasant lunch.\n\nIt was a little after one o'clock when I reached the Harvard Club. The\ndoor-man glanced at my face and automatically stuck a little ivory\npeg in the hole opposite the name of Tompkins on the list of members.\nI checked my hat and coat and strolled through the sitting-rooms into\nthe large lounge-library beside the dining-room. A couple of men\nnodded and smiled as I passed them, so I nodded back and said, \"Hi!\"\nin a conversational tone. In the lounge I found a chair and a copy\nof the World-Telegram, so I decided to catch up with the war-news.\nThe German Armies were beginning to crumble but there was still talk\nof a stand along the Elbe and Hitler was reported fortifying the\nmountain-districts of Southern Germany into a redoubt for a last\nValhalla Battle. The Pacific news was good. The fighting on Okinawa was\ngoing our way and the clean-up in the Philippines was well in hand. The\nNavy Department discounted enemy reports of heavy damage to American\nwarships by Jap suicide-pilots but, as an old Navy P.R.O., I could tell\nthat it had been plenty. I'd heard about the Kamikazes from some of our\npilots who had seen them off Leyte and I had no doubt that they were\ndoing a job on the 7th Fleet. Roosevelt had gone South for a couple of\nweeks rest at Warm Springs, Georgia, and Ed Stettinius was in the final\nthroes of organizing the United Nations Conference at San Francisco--\n\n\"Hi, Winnie? Don't you speak to your old friends any more?\"\n\nI looked up to see a lean, wolfish-looking man, with a gray moustache,\na slightly bald head and definitely Bond Street clothes.\n\n\"Oh, hullo!\" I said and returned to reading the paper.\n\nThe newspaper was firmly taken out of my hands and the man sat down\nbeside me.\n\n\"We've got to have a talk,\" he said.\n\n\"Why? What's happened?\"\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about you running around town in the last\ntwenty-four hours, Winnie. None of the other alleged friends we know\nhad the guts to tell you. But I thought your room-mate--\"\n\n\"So you're Merry Vail,\" I said stupidly.\n\n\"You're in worse shape than I thought you were, Winnie,\" he replied.\n\"Yes, I'm Merriwether Vail who started his life-long career of rescuing\nWinfred Tompkins from blondes and booze at Harvard in 1916. Now, if\nyou'll just crawl out of your alcoholic coma and listen to me for five\nminutes before you take off for your next skirt, you'll learn something\nto your advantage.\"\n\n\"How about a drink, Merry?\" I asked, to keep in character.\n\n\"Not before five, so help me, and you'd better lay off liquor till you\nhear this. Here it is. There's a story going the rounds that the F.B.I.\nis after you. At any rate, at least one obvious G-man has been reported\nin full cry on your foot-prints.\"\n\nI sat up, startled. This was too much, even for purgatory. What _had_\nWinnie been up to?\n\n\"What am I supposed to have done, Merry?\" I asked. \"Trifled with the\nMann Act? Told fibs on my income tax return? Failed to notify the local\ndraft board that I was taking the train to New York? Bought black\nmarket nylons for my mistress? or what?\"\n\nVail looked mysterious. \"For all I know I may be letting myself in\nfor Alcatraz, old man, but the dope is that you've been violating the\nEspionage Act, communicating with the enemy, or stealing official\nsecrets.\"\n\nI leaned back in my chair and shook with laughter. \"Of all the pure,\nunadulterated b.s. I've ever heard! I give you my word of honor as a\nPorcellian that there's not a syllable of truth in it.\"\n\nVail looked increasingly distressed. \"If you're really innocent, you'd\nbetter be careful. Ten-to-one you haven't an alibi, and you'll need\na lawyer. Slip me a bill now and retain me as your counsel. No, this\nisn't a gag. Something's cooking, even if it's only mistaken identity,\nand I've seen enough of the law in war-time to know that you'll be\nbetter off with the old cry, 'I demand to see my attorney,' when they\nmarch you down to the F.B.I. headquarters to answer a few questions.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Merry,\" I said, \"and here's twenty bucks to go on with. If\nthe police are looking for me, I'd better go down to my office and see\nthat things are apple-pie before they lock up the brains of our outfit.\n\n\"Besides,\" I added, \"you've just given me an idea of how I can make a\nhell of a lot of money.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\nTompkins, Wasson & Cone maintained sincere-looking offices on one\nof the upper floors of No. 1 Wall Street. The rooms were carefully\nfurnished in dark wood and turkey-red upholstery, in a style calculated\nto reassure elderly ladies of great wealth that the firm was careful\nand conservative.\n\nThe girl at the reception desk looked as though she had graduated with\nhonor from Wellesley in the class of 1920 and still had it--pince-nez\nand condescension--but she was thoroughly up-to-date in her\noffice-technique.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Tompkins,\" she murmured in a clear, low voice, \"there's a\ngentleman waiting to see you in the customer's room, a Mr. Harcourt.\nHe's been here since ten o'clock this morning.\"\n\n\"He's had no lunch?\" I inquired.\n\nShe shook her head.\n\nI clucked my tongue. \"We can't have our customers starve to death, can\nwe? Send out for a club sandwich and some hot coffee. Give me five\nminutes to take a look at my mail and then send him in. When the food\narrives, send that in, too.\"\n\nShe blinked her hazel eyes behind her pince-nez to show that she\nunderstood, and I walked confidently down to the end of the corridor to\nwhere a \"Mr. Tompkins\" stared at me conservatively from a glazed door.\n\nMy office lived up to my fondest dream of Winnie. It was an ingenious\nblend of the 1870's and functional furniture--like a cocktail of port\nwine and vodka. There were electric clocks, a silenced stock-ticker\nin a glass-covered mahogany coffin, an elaborate Sheraton radio\nwith short-wave reception, tuned in on WQXR, and desks and chairs\nand divans and a really good steel engraving showing General Grant\nreceiving Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House, with a chart\nunderneath to explain who was who in the picture.\n\nThe desk I was glad to note, was bare except for an electric\nclock-calendar which told me that it was 3:12 p.m. of April 4, 1945,\nand a handsome combination humidor, cigarette case and automatic\nlighter in aluminum and synthetic tortoise-shell. A glance out the\nwindow gave me a reassuring glimpse of the spire of Trinity Church.\nThere was a single typed memo on the glass top of the desk, which read:\n\"Mr. Harcourt, 10:13 a.m. Would not state business. Will wait.\"\n\nI pushed one of the array of buttons concealed underneath the edge of\nthe desk and a door opened to admit a largish blonde in a tight-fitting\nsweater.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Tompkins?\"\n\n\"Please have Mr. Harcourt sent in,\" I said, \"And when he comes, bring\nyour notebook and take a stenographic record of our conversation\nand--er--what's your name?\"\n\nShe raised her well-plucked eyebrows. \"I'm Eleanor Roosevelt, my\nparents named me Arthurjean--after both of them--Arthurjean--Miss\nBriggs to you!\"\n\n\"Very well, Miss Briggs, tell Mr. Harcourt I'll see him now.\"\n\nA moment later, she reappeared holding a card in her fingers as though\nit was a live cockroach. \"Sure you want to see this?\" she asked.\n\nThe card read: \"Mr. A. J. Harcourt, Special Agent. Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, U. S. Department of Justice, U. S. Court House, Foley\nSquare, New York 23, N. Y.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I replied, \"I've been expecting him for some time.\"\n\nA. J. Harcourt was neat but not gaudy: a clean-cut, Hart, Shaffner and\nMarx tailored man of about thirty-five, with that indefinable family\nresemblance to J. Edgar Hoover which always worries me about the F.B.I.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Mr. Harcourt,\" I said pleasantly, \"and what can I do\nfor the F.B.I.?\"\n\nHarcourt shook my hand, took a seat, refused a cigarette and cast a\ndoubtful glance over his shoulder at Arthurjean Briggs, who was working\nsemi-silently away at a stenotype machine.\n\n\"Oh, that's my secretary,\" I explained. \"I always have her take a\nrecord of important conversations in this office. I hope the machine\ndoesn't disturb you, Mr. Harcourt.\"\n\n\"If it's all right with you it's all right with me,\" he said\ngrudgingly. \"I thought perhaps you'd rather have this private.\"\n\n\"Not in the least,\" I replied. \"Miss Briggs is the soul of discretion\nand I can imagine nothing we could talk about that I wouldn't want her\nto hear.\"\n\nThe G-Man looked as though he was worrying over whether he ought to\ncall Washington for permission. They hadn't taught him this one in\nthe F.B.I. academy of finger-printing, marksmanship, shadowing and\nwire-tapping.\n\n\"By the way, Mr. Harcourt,\" I added, \"I just learned as I came in that\nyou've been waiting for me since ten this morning. It's after three now\nso I took the liberty of sending out for a sandwich and some coffee for\nyou. I thought you might like a bite of lunch while you are talking\nwith me.\"\n\nThe Special Agent looked as surprised as though he had found Hoover's\nfingerprints on the murder-gun, but he nodded gamely.\n\n\"Here it is now,\" I remarked, as there was a knock on the door and\na knowing-looking boy placed an appealing tray-load of sandwiches,\npickles and coffee in front of Mr. Harcourt.\n\n\"Now you go right ahead and eat your lunch,\" I urged. \"Ask me for any\ninformation in my possession and you shall have it. And of course\nI'll have Miss Briggs send a complete transcript of our talk to you\nat F.B.I. headquarters by registered mail. First of all, if you don't\nmind, would you show me your official identification and let Miss\nBriggs take down the number and so on. It's always best to put these\nthings in the record, isn't it?\"\n\nThe G-Man gulped and produced a battered identity card, complete with\nfingerprints, number, Hoover's signature and a photograph which would\nhave justified his immediate arrest on suspicion of bank-robbery.\n\n\"I imagine, Mr. Harcourt,\" I remarked, \"that you've had plenty of time\nin the last five hours to question members of my staff about whatever\nit is you think they might know about my business.\"\n\nHe looked up, almost pathetically. \"I asked a few questions,\" he\nadmitted. \"This is just an informal inquiry. Nothing for Grand Jury\naction--yet.\"\n\nI didn't like that last word.\n\n\"Do you think I ought to call my lawyer in before I proceed with our\ntalk?\" I asked. \"I resent your reference to Grand Jury action. So far,\nI don't even know what you wish to see me about and you have just made\na libelous statement in front of a reliable witness. Is that the way J.\nEdgar Hoover trains his Gestapo?\"\n\n\"I--well--\"\n\n\"Come on, Harcourt, let's get on with it!\" I interrupted. \"I'm a busy\nman and you've wasted five hours of the time my taxes help to pay for,\njust waiting to take more of my time.\"\n\nHe pulled a black leather notebook out of his pocket and consulted it.\n\n\"The Bureau was asked to interrogate you, Mr. Tompkins, on behalf of\nanother government agency.\"\n\n\"Which? Internal Revenue? W.P.B.? The S.E.C?\"\n\n\"No sir, it was none of those. I'm not at liberty to tell you which\none. I am simply instructed to ask you what you know about U.S.S.\nAlaska and naval dispositions in the North Pacific.\"\n\nI leaned back and laughed. \"Now I get it,\" I said. \"That's O.N.I, and\nthat triple-plated ass, Ranty Tolan, trying to win the war in the\nbarrooms of New York. It all goes back to a dream I had while I was\ndozing at the Pond Club Monday afternoon. Something about the U.S.S.\nAlaska being blown up off the Aleutians. Tolan was there when I woke up\nand I passed a few remarks about my dream before I was fully awake, if\nyou know what I mean. That's all there is to it, Mr. Harcourt.\"\n\nThe Special Agent made a number of hen-tracks in his notebook.\n\n\"Thank you very much, Mr. Tompkins,\" he said. \"No doubt you'll be able\nto explain things if my chief wants to call you in. I don't think my\nchief believes in dreams. Not that kind of dream. Not in war-time.\"\n\nI laughed again. \"I'm afraid I can't help that. So far as I am\nconcerned, the F.B.I. can believe in my dream or stick it in the files.\"\n\nHarcourt coughed. \"It's not easy working with O.N.I, or other\nintelligence outfits,\" he said. \"They never tell us anything. The\ntrouble with your dream seems to be that the general public isn't\nsupposed to know that the U.S.S. Alaska is in commission and that the\nNavy department has had no word from her since last Saturday.\"\n\n\"Don't let that worry you,\" I said. \"If she was anywhere near the\nKuriles, she'd keep radio silence, specially off Paramushiro.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Harcourt remarked. \"O.N.I. didn't say anything about Paramushiro.\nThank you, Mr. Tompkins. We'll be in touch with you, off and on.\"\n\nHe rose, very politely, shook hands again, thanked me for the food,\nnodded to Miss Briggs and made a definitely Grade A exit.\n\nHis steps died away down the corridor. Miss Briggs waited until he\nwas out of earshot then turned to me. \"You God damned fool!\" she said\nfondly. \"You had him bluffed until you talked about Paramushiro. Why\ndid you admit anything?\"\n\nI looked up at her broad, pleasant face.\n\n\"So you've made a monkey out of me. I alibied you up and down. Listen,\nWinnie, the F.B.I. have been all over the joint since early yesterday.\nWe were warned not to whisper a word to you. There was an agent waiting\nto grill me when I got home last night. I told him you'd been spending\nthe week-end with me.\"\n\n\"You told him--\" I was startled.\n\n\"Sure! Why not? He wasn't interested in my morals. I told him about our\nplace up in the fifties and gave you a complete alibi from Friday close\nof business until Monday noon. And now you have to make like a Nazi\nwith the ships in the Pacific. Say, what is it you've supposed to have\ndone--kissed MacArthur?\"\n\n\"Damned if I know, Miss Briggs. That's part of the trouble.\"\n\n\"Lay off that 'Miss Briggs' stuff. That was to punish you for giving\nme the fish-eye when you came in. I'm your Arthurjean and the market's\nclosed so you'd better catch the subway uptown with me and I'll cook\nyou a steak dinner at our place.\"\n\nThis was too deep water for hesitation, so I took the plunge. Taking\nmy hat and coat I told the genteel receptionist that I'd be back in\nthe morning. I waited for Arthurjean at the foot of the elevators and\nfollowed her lead, into the East Side subway and up to the 51st Street\nstation, on to \"our place.\"\n\nIt was very discreet--an old brown-stone front converted into small\napartments. There was no door-man and an automatic elevator prevented\nany intrusive check on the comings and goings of the tenants. The\nthird-floor front had been made into a pleasant little two-room\nsuite--a \"master's bedroom\" (Why not 'mistress's?' I thought) with a\ndouble-bed, dresser and chairs, and an array of ducks which revealed\nthe true Tompkins touch. There was a small sitting-dining room as\nwell, and a kitchenette with a satisfactory array of bottles in the\nFrigidaire and a reasonable amount of groceries.\n\nArthurjean took off her hat and coat, fixed me a good stiff drink and\nthen disappeared into the bathroom. After a good deal of splashing and\ngurgling, she reappeared clad in maroon satin pyjamas.\n\n\"There,\" she said, \"now I feel better.\"\n\nI smiled at her. \"Here's to Arthurjean!\" I said.\n\n\"Nuts to Arthurjean,\" she replied. \"How about Winnie? You've always\nbeen swell to me, and you know it. I don't care if you're a louse or\na souse. You can always come to me any time you're in trouble and\nI'll fix you up. Now you're in trouble with the cops, so how about me\nhelping you? Huh?\"\n\n\"You're a good kid,\" I said truthfully, for Arthurjean was indeed one\nof God's own sweet tarts. \"The truth is I'm in all kinds of a jam. You\nsee, I can't seem to remember what I've been doing before last Monday.\nIt's sort of like loss of memory, only worse. This F.B.I. thing is only\none of my headaches.\"\n\nShe looked at me questioningly. \"So you don't remember where you were\nbefore Monday?\" she asked. She slouched across the room, leaned down\nand gave me a hearty kiss. \"Will that help you remember? It was like\nI told that detective. You and me were right here in this place over\nEaster and don't forget it.\"\n\nI sighed. I liked Arthurjean, though she was as corned-beef and cabbage\nto Germaine's caviar and champagne. \"Okay,\" I said. \"I won't forget it.\"\n\n\"Attaboy!\" she agreed. \"Now that we've got that settled, suppose you\ntell me where the hell you really were over the week-end. You stood me\nup Friday night and today's the first time I've set eyes on you since\nyou left the office Friday morning. Boy, you may have some explaining\nto do to the F.B.I., but it's nothing to what you got to explain to\nmomma.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\n\"And so, Arthurjean,\" I concluded, \"my guess is that for some crazy\nreason it's up to me to take up where Winnie left off and try to do a\ngood job with the hand he's dealt himself.\"\n\nShe remained silent, hunched on the floor beside me, with her maroon\npyjamas straining visibly and a pile of cigarette butts in the\nash-tray at her side.\n\n\"Give me a break,\" I pleaded. \"When I tried to tell my wife--Winnie's\nwife--Mrs. Tompkins, that is--all she could think of was to send me off\nto a plush-lined booby-hatch until I was sane again. The others--at\nleast Virginia Rutherford--are beginning to suspect that something is\nwrong and that damned dog knows it. So be original and pretend that I\nmight be telling the truth.\"\n\nShe didn't answer. Instead, she stood up, stretched, strolled over to\nthe kitchenette and mixed us both two good stiff drinks.\n\n\"Mud in your eye!\" she said.\n\n\"Glad to see you on board!\"\n\n\"I don't see why not,\" she observed conversationally. \"I don't pretend\nto be smart and I know that the other girls in the office think I'm\nnothing but a tramp because I don't pretend I don't like men, but I'm\ndamned if I think that Winnie, who is one of God's sweetest dumb-bells,\ncould have dreamed up anything as screwy as this.\"\n\n\"As I remember him, he wasn't any too bright,\" I said.\n\n\"Skip it! He wasn't dumb in business. He picked up a couple of million\nbucks and gave them a good home in his safe-deposit box. He wasn't so\nhot on music and books and art--except for his damned ducks--but he was\na lot of fun. He liked a good time and he liked a girl to have a good\ntime. He should have been born in one of those Latin countries where\nthe women do all the work and the men play guitars, drink and make\nlove.\"\n\nI drew a deep breath. I had won my first convert. I knew what Paul\nof Tarsus felt when he met up with Timothy. I thought of Mahomet and\nFatima, Karl Marx and Bakunin, Hitler and Hess. Crazy though the whole\nworld would consider me, here was one human being who could listen to\nmy story without phoning for an ambulance.\n\n\"Tell me about this Frank Jacklin,\" Arthurjean remarked. \"I don't get\nall the angles about him and this Dorothy. Seems to me you--Winnie,\nthat is--told me he was the guy she'd had a sort of crush on at school.\nWinnie was still sort of sore about it twenty years later.\"\n\n\"It's hard for me to be fair,\" I admitted. \"Jacklin was a big shot at\nschool and may have had a swelled head. Winnie wasn't so hot then--nice\nbut with too much money. Jacklin's people were poor, by comparison that\nis. He got through Yale, slid out into the newspaper game, held his\njob, married a girl, had a bust-up with his wife and joined the Navy as\na reserve officer after she walked out on him. The Navy assigned him to\nP.R.O. work and sent him to the Pacific.\"\n\n\"He sounds like a heel,\" she observed, \"leaving his wife like that.\nTell me more about her. Is she pretty?\"\n\nI thought a long time. \"I don't quite know,\" I said finally. \"I never\nknew. She was necessary to me, long after I was necessary to her. She\nhad a mole on her left hip and a gruff way of talking when she was\nreally fond of me. I guess she got tired of living in Hartford and took\nit out on me.\"\n\n\"Any kids?\"\n\nI shook my head vigorously. \"Cost too much on a newspaper salary. She\nsaid she didn't want any until we could afford them. I was fool enough\nto believe her. Then when we could afford them she didn't want them.\nCan't say I blame her.\"\n\n\"Did she make you happy?\"\n\n\"Of course not! Who wants to be happy? She made me miserable, but\nit was exciting to be around her. I never knew what I'd find when\nI got home--a knockdown drag-out fight over nothing at all or\nhearts-and-flowers equally over nothing.\"\n\nArthurjean yawned. \"That part's convincing,\" she agreed. \"I'll play\nthis one straight. You're Frank Jacklin _and_ Winnie Tompkins rolled\ninto one. The point is, where do we go from here? Let's see you sign\nJacklin's name.\"\n\nI pulled out Winnie's gold, life-time fountain pen and wrote \"Frank E.\nJacklin\" over and over again on the back of an envelope. She studied it\ncarefully.\n\n\"That's no phony,\" she agreed, \"and it's nothing like Winnie's\nhandwriting. Think I could get a check cashed on it?\"\n\n\"Let's try,\" I suggested. \"Tomorrow when I get to the office I'll\npre-date a check on the Riggs Bank at Washington. You mail it in for\ncollection and we'll see if it clears.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"No dice! If I tried that, first thing we know we'd\nhave the A.B.A. dicks after you for forgery. Can you think of anything\nelse?\"\n\n\"Not unless you go to Washington and see Dorothy in O.S.S. and ask her\nto verify my handwriting. Or, wait. You can go and talk to her and\nnotice whether she wriggles her nose to keep her spectacles up. You\ncan find out whether she's still nuts about Prokofiev. You can ask if\nshe still thinks that Ernest Hemingway is a worse writer than Charles\nDickens, and whether she still uses Chanel's Gardenia perfume.\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" she interrupted. \"But how'm I going to get to\nWashington and do all these things?\"\n\n\"Next week,\" I said, \"you and I can fly down on a business\ntrip--war-contracts, cut-backs, something official--and while I'm being\nwhip-sawed by the desk-heroes you can check on Dorothy. See if I'm not\nright.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"That's one way. What can we cook up? The office is tied up\nin estate work and that leaves no chance for Uncle Sam. You get what he\nleaves the heirs and they tell me that the inheritance tax is here to\nstay.\"\n\nI considered the problem. \"Tell you what, Arthurjean,\" I replied. \"I've\nbeen thinking this over. The war's going to end this summer. What I saw\non the Alaska means that nobody can hold out against us. The Germans\nare on their last legs, but most of the wise guys are saying that\nit will take from eighteen months to two years to clean up Japan--a\nmillion casualties, billions of dollars. This thorium bomb will do\nthe trick and the war will be over by Labor Day. There's a chance for\nWinnie Tompkins to make another two or three millions.\"\n\nShe laughed sardonically. \"How?\"\n\n\"There's uranium stocks,\" I suggested.\n\n\"All sewed up by the insiders. Last year you--or Winnie--got a query on\nuranium and found that there wasn't any to be had.\"\n\n\"There's wheat and sugar,\" I argued. \"The world's going to be hungry.\nThere's a famine coming sure as hell. Buy futures and we'll be set.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" she agreed, \"if you want to buy Black and can get funds into\nCuba or the Argentine. But there are inter-allied pools operating in\nsugar and wheat and you can't break into the game without connections\nat Washington.\"\n\n\"How about peace-babies?\" I demanded. \"We can sell our war bonds and\ninvest in something solid for post-war reconstruction. Say General\nMotors or U.S. Steel.\"\n\nArthurjean crossed the room and rumpled my head affectionately. \"Baby,\"\nshe observed, \"it's damn lucky for you and Winnie's dough I know my way\naround the Street. Lay off heavy industrials until the labor business\ngets straightened out. It's all set for a big strike-wave when the\nshooting stops and a lot of investors are going to be burned. You can\nsell short of course but you'll have to wait for that. If you must go\nin for gambling, try the race-track or the slot-machines. Uncle Sam has\nit fixed so that the only way you can make money out of the peace is\nto be a Swiss or a Swede.\"\n\n\"But that doesn't make sense,\" I objected. \"In any place and at any\ntime, advance knowledge on what is going to happen is worth a fortune.\nHow about selling some of the war industries short?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"You wait till you've been to Washington. Some of\nthe smart guys down there may know the answers. Perhaps it will be\nreal-estate, if they can only get rid of rent-control. Probably it will\nbe surplus war-stocks but that's going to be a political racket. Anyhow\nthe tax-collector will be waiting for you, so why worry?\"\n\n\"Speaking of cashing checks,\" I reminded her, \"how in hell am I going\nto get some dough? How does Winnie sign himself at the City Farmers\nanyhow?\"\n\nShe laughed. \"He has three or four separate accounts. The one he uses\nfor purely personal hell-raising is just signed 'W. S. Tompkins.' Let's\nsee you try to write that. Remember he loops all his letters and draws\na little circle instead of a dot over the 'i'.\"\n\nI tried that a few times until she shook her head.\n\n\"There isn't a bank-clerk in New York who wouldn't stop a check with\nthat on it. Let's see, he signed his name to something around here. See\nif you can't copy it.\"\n\nShe fumbled under a pile of magazines and finally came up with a copy\nof \"The Story of Philosophy\" by Will Durant.\n\n\"Winnie thought this would be good for me,\" she explained. \"Here\nit is: 'For Miss Arthurjean Briggs, with the compliments of W. S.\nTompkins.' He was like that--sort of formal--it gave him a kick. He\nbought that for me second-hand after we'd been drinking Atlantic City\ndry at an investment bankers convention. Try it.\"\n\nI tried the signature again but the effort was even worse than my\nfree-hand efforts. This time it looked like what it was--a clumsy\nforgery.\n\n\"Hell,\" I exclaimed, \"I've simply got to do better than that. How about\nmy tracing it?\"\n\n\"You'd be surprised,\" she told me, \"how easy it is to spot a signature\nthat's been traced. It's something about the flow of the ink and the\nangle of the pen. No two signatures are exactly alike and that's why a\ntracing gives itself away. They got machines which spot it.\"\n\n\"Well, how'm I going to get some dough?\" I demanded. \"I can't draw on\nJacklin's Washington account--and the chances are there isn't much\nthere anyhow. And if I try to draw on Tompkins' account I'll find\nmyself in the hoosegow.\"\n\nShe got up and mixed us another pair of drinks. \"I got it,\" she\nannounced. \"It won't be too nice for you but it's better than starving.\"\n\n\"You mean you'll lend me some?\"\n\n\"Hell, baby, I got no money--twenty-five or thirty in the account and a\nfew hundreds in war-bonds. No, this is better. Just hold out your hand\nand shut your eyes.\"\n\nIt sounded like jewels. I leaned back in the chair, closed my eyes and\nextended my right hand in front of me, palm upward. I heard her pad\ninto the bathroom. When she came back, her voice sounded strained as\nshe whispered: \"This is it, baby. Keep those eyes shut!\"\n\nThere was a smooth, tingling sensation across the tips of my fingers,\nthen my right hand was suddenly warm and wet. I opened my eyes to see\nArthurjean holding a stained safety-razor blade in her hand and staring\nat me, white-faced, as the blood trickled from my finger-tips.\n\n\"Winnie--\" she faltered, and slumped down in the divan.\n\nI hastily grabbed the handkerchief from my breast-pocket and wrapped it\naround my throbbing fingers.\n\n\"Ouch! Damn you!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"I'm sorry, baby,\" she whispered. \"I didn't want to hurt you. It seemed\nthe only way--\"\n\n\"You damned fool,\" I almost shouted at her. \"Do you realize you flopped\nwith that blade in your hand and might have cut an artery?\"\n\n\"No, did I?\" She scrambled up hastily and looked around. \"Gee, I feel\nlousy. Does it hurt much?\"\n\n\"Not yet. What's the big idea?\"\n\n\"Now you sound like Winnie,\" she replied. \"He never got ideas easy.\nListen, you big slob, if you've cut your fingers you got to have a\nbandage and if you got a bandage on your right hand, your signature's\ngoing to be screwy. All you need do is fumble it and I or one of the\ngirls will witness it and the bank will clear it and you'll get the\ndough.\"\n\nI thought that one over. \"You've got something in your head besides\nthose big blue eyes,\" I admitted. \"Now if you only have some iodine and\nbandages we'll see if I can stave off lock-jaw.\"\n\nShe giggled. \"Lock-jaw's the last thing _you'll_ get,\" she said. \"There\nought to be something in the medicine cabinet. Gee,\" she added. \"I\nsuppose I'll have to get you undressed and dress you in the morning\njust like a baby. Ain't that something?\"\n\n\"How about some food?\" I demanded. \"You said something about a steak\nback at the office and all you've given me is Scotch and razor-blades.\nYou get on with your cooking and let me try to fix my hand.\"\n\nI went into the bathroom, located some mercurochrome and a box of band\naids. Once the flow of blood had slacked, I managed to incapacitate\nmyself sufficiently for the purpose of forging Winnie Tompkins'\nsignature.\n\n\"Say, Winnie!\" Arthurjean suddenly appeared at the bathroom door, with\nan aroma of steak behind her. \"I've just figured out something. If you\naren't Winnie but a ringer from the Aleutians, it's not decent for you\nto see me in my pyjamas. We're strangers!\"\n\n\"Oh, keep 'em on till after dinner,\" I said. \"I won't stand on\nceremony. I'm hungry.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"You sure can make like Winnie,\" she admired. \"Jesus, the\nsteak's burning!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\n\"Say, old man, what happened to your hand?\" Graham Wasson, plump, dark\nand fortyish, but very clean-cut and with a Dewey dab on his upper\nlip, was my questioner. He sat across the glass-topped desk in my Wall\nStreet Office, while Arthurjean Briggs typed demurely in the adjoining\noffice.\n\n\"Changing razor-blades,\" I confessed. \"The damn thing slipped and\nbefore I knew it I made a grab for it. Lucky it didn't go deep. Hence\nthe surgical gauze and the lousy signature. Do you think you can get my\ncheck cleared through the bank or should I write Winnie 'X' Tompkins,\nhis mark?\"\n\nWasson chuckled like a well-fed broker. \"We'll get enough witnesses to\nyour John Hancock to make it legal,\" he promised. \"Now what you've got\nto do is to ease old lady Fynch into the trustee's delight and take a\ngander at her former investments. I've brought the list with me. As you\nknow, she insisted that you okay the deal.\"\n\nI glanced at the typed list. \"This stuff looks pretty good to me,\nGraham,\" I said. \"Detroit Edison's safe as the Washington Monument,\nA.T.&T. is solid, and G.E. ought to do all right with this new\nelectronic stuff.\"\n\n\"And how!\" My partner agreed. \"Boy! what a windfall! Stuff like that is\nscarcer than hen's teeth on the open market. With close to a million\nbucks to turn over, we ought to do pretty well on this. Here's what\nwe're buying for her.\"\n\nWasson passed me a slip of paper. \"The trustee's delight,\" he said.\n\"G-Bonds. You buy 'em, we should worry. No money back for ten years.\nMorgenthau's dream-child.\"\n\nThe slip was attached to a printed Treasury form. \"See here,\" I\npointed out. \"These damn bonds depreciate 2.2% a year for the first\nfive years and then start climbing up the ladder again, and they're\nnon-transferable.\"\n\n\"That's it, Winnie. The trustee's delight,\" Wasson agreed. \"They pay\n2-1/2% a year if you hold them but if you try to sell them within\nfive years the discount means you only get about .03% on your money.\nOnce a trustee has put you aboard this roller-coaster, he can't\nconscientiously advise you to get out.\"\n\n\"Who dreamed up that swindle?\"\n\n\"Oh, a couple of dollar-a-year bankers we sent down to help the\nTreasury win the war. It's a natural. It's patriotic to invest in\nwar-bonds. The yield's conservative as hell and you get it all back if\nyou wait long enough.\"\n\n\"But what if the old girl dies within the next five years? Won't the\nestate be liquidated? How will the heirs feel when they have to take a\nloss of $60,000?\"\n\n\"That's their worry, Winnie,\" Wasson pointed out. \"All we have to do is\nsign the papers and la Fynch gets about $25,000 a year for the rest of\nher life.\"\n\n\"Instead of the $40,000 a year she's getting out of her present\ninvestments now.\"\n\n\"Sure, Winnie. We're not in business for our health. Industrials are\nrisky and Miss Fynch is awful set on beating Hitler. We take over her\npresent portfolio and take our chances on the market. If values shift\nwe're in a position to unload--but fast. She isn't. She only gets to\ntown twice a year, once between Bar Harbor and Long Island, and then\nnext time from Palm Beach to Long Island. Come on, Winnie, stick your\nfist on these papers and I'll handle the transfers.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"I'd like to think this over,\" I said. \"If I was an\nold woman and expected only five or ten more years of life, I'd be\nhanged if I'd tie myself down to these financial mustard-plasters. It\nsounds okay to be patriotic, but I think I'd stick to the greater risks\nand higher yields and get a run for my money. Tell you what, Graham,\nyou phone and tell her I'd like to have a talk with her before she\nmakes up her mind.\"\n\nWasson shoved back his chair and faced me, bristling. \"I'll be damned\nif I will. This is a natural and, handled right, is worth $100,000 to\nthe firm. You talked her into it and now if you're getting cold feet\nyou can talk her out of it. All I know is that you've gone nuts.\"\n\n\"We aren't so hard up that we have to swindle old ladies.\"\n\n\"Swindle my eye! What's wrong about $25,000 a year guaranteed by your\nUncle Sam?\"\n\n\"Less income tax,\" I reminded him.\n\n\"Oh, sure--that--\"\n\n\"Well, it's about $15,000 a year less than she's getting now. If she\nsold out and invested in an annuity she could get about $70,000 a year,\ntax-free. No, I don't want to rush her into this.\"\n\n\"Then you've forgotten how we made our pile in the first place,\" my\npartner growled. \"Phil Cone and I will have to talk this over. This is\na fine time to go soft on us.\"\n\nI grinned at him. \"Go on, talk it over. If you want out, you're\nwelcome. I'd rather like you to stick around, as I'm on to something\nreally big and I don't want the Street to say we fleeced our clients.\"\n\n\"I resent that, Winnie,\" Wasson snapped.\n\n\"What else would you call it? Reinvesting?\"\n\n\"Listen,\" he exploded. \"You built up this business. You invented the\nmethods. I'm damned if I let you call me a swindler for following your\nlead!\" And he stormed out, slamming the door. A moment later, he stuck\nhis head in again. \"Forget it, Winnie. If you're working on a big\noperation, count me in!\"\n\nI studied the list of the Fynch investments again and the more I saw\nit the more I wondered how anybody but a fool would fall for the\nproposition of putting money in the government bonds for ten years,\nwhen you could clean up outside government.\n\nThere was a tap on the edge of my desk. I looked up to see Arthurjean.\n\"Mr. Harcourt is back to see you,\" she said. \"I'll get set with the\nstenotype. And don't worry about that Fynch dame. I'll give you a\nfill-in later. She knows what she's doing.\"\n\n\"Fine!\" I told her. \"Now you show Mr. Harcourt in and make with the\nstenotype. Did you finish copying what we said yesterday?\"\n\nHer mouth dropped open and her sweater quivered eloquently. \"Omigawd!\nbaby! I clean forgot.\"\n\nMr. Harcourt seemed much more vital and self-possessed than on the\nprevious afternoon--perhaps because he had obviously had a sleep, a\nshower and a hearty breakfast, presumably prefaced by ten minutes of\nvigorous push-ups and toe-touching in bathroom calisthenics. At any\nrate he looked fit.\n\n\"Morning, Harcourt,\" I said casually. \"Sorry to tell you that Miss\nBriggs was home with a bad headache last night and wasn't able to make\nthat copy of our talk yesterday.\"\n\nG-Men on duty are not supposed to smile without written permission from\ntheir immediate superior but Harcourt must have had an extra helping of\nWheaties for breakfast. \"Call yourself a headache, Mr. Tompkins?\" he\nasked. \"That's who our man reported Miss Briggs had last night at 157\nEast 51st Street, third floor front. Can I get her some aspirin?\"\n\n\"There are no secrets from the Gestapo,\" I observed, \"and I have no\ncomment to offer except to say next time come on up and have a drink\nwith us instead of doing the G-Man in a cold and drafty doorway across\nthe street.\"\n\nThe Special Agent gave an entirely unofficial wink at Arthurjean.\n\"Oh, hell,\" he remarked. \"What's the use of all this coy stuff? The\nBureau isn't interested in your private life. What I wanted to say, Mr.\nTompkins, is that I reported our talk to my chief and he teletyped my\nreport down to Washington. We're not going to fool around with Church\nStreet on this one. The Director's going to take it up direct with\nAdmiral Ballister at the Navy Department. For my part, I told him I\nthought it was all a pipe-dream but like I said the F.B.I. doesn't\nbelieve in dreams that come true.\"\n\nArthurjean crossed the room and stood behind him, pressing a little\nunregenerately against the back of his chair, until Harcourt remarked\nconversationally to U. S. Grant in the engraving, \"I'm a married man,\nbaby, with a wife and kids in Brooklyn.\"\n\nMy secretary smiled and gave him a smart tap on the top of his head.\n\"You're a good boy, junior,\" she told him, \"and I'm all for you. But\ndon't you go making trouble for this dumb boss of mine or I'll call on\nyour wife, personal, and Tell All.\"\n\nHarcourt murmured to the engraving that unconditional surrender was\n_his_ name, too, but that Tompkins was making so much trouble for\nhimself that he was damned if he could see how the F.B.I. could make it\nany worse. In any case, he added more directly, he would keep in touch\nwith me and let me know whether I was wanted up at the Federal Court\nHouse.\n\n\"See here, Harcourt,\" I replied. \"One good turn doesn't make a spring.\nThis is the screwiest case you've ever been on. If you can drop in and\nvisit Miss Briggs and myself on Saturday after lunch at our place, I'll\ngive you a fill-in that will rock the F.B.I. from its gats to its\ntoupees.\"\n\n\"That's mighty white of you--and Miss Briggs,\" the Special Agent\nallowed. \"If the chief lets me, I'll meet you up there, say about 2:30.\"\n\n\"Swell!\" I said. \"And which do you prefer--Scotch or rye?\"\n\n\"I don't drink on duty,\" he told me, \"but I find Bourbon helps fight\noff colds this early spring weather.\"\n\nAfter his departure, I locked myself in the office and with\nArthurjean's help, brought myself up to date on Winnie's business\noperations. Tompkins, Wasson & Cone were not, as I had believed, a\nhigh-toned bucket-shop. The proposed Fynch swindle was only the result\nof a dopey old maid who practically insisted on helping beat the Axis\nby turning her money into Government bonds. There was plenty of honest\ngraft and many a solid perquisite in straight commission work and\nsupervision of estates. The firm was not, of course, very scrupulous\nbut it always gave value for its transactions. It was, in fact, a\npretty slick set-up.\n\nThere was a buzz on my inter-office telephone and the receptionist\nannounced: \"Mr. Axel Roscommon to see you, Mr. Tompkins.\"\n\n\"Oh, ask him to see one of the other partners, will you?\"\n\n\"I told him that you were too busy, but he said he must see you and\nwould wait.\"\n\n\"He too?\" I asked. \"Okay. Send him in. Do you know an Axel Roscommon,\nArthurjean?\"\n\n\"Uh-uh!\" She shook her head. \"The name's sorta familiar. Something in\noil before Pearl Harbor. I can find out if you'll wait a bit.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" I told her. \"I'll see him. You stay in the next room and\nkeep the door ajar so you can take a record.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"I can do better than that, boss. I'll switch down the\ninter-office phones and keep the door shut. That way. I'll hear every\nword you say. It's like a dictaphone.\"\n\nMr. Roscommon was an extremely well set up man in the middle fifties,\nabout six-feet two, lean, with iron grey hair, a grey moustache,\nsteel-blue eyes and a bear-trap grip. He looked prosperous but not\nworried by it. He spoke with a faint Irish lilt in his voice but his\nmanner was most direct and unHibernian.\n\n\"Mr. Tompkins,\" he remarked. \"You must excuse the lack of formality\nbut you will understand when I tell you that I am chief of the German\nintelligence organization in the United States. Now don't think I'm\ncrazy or indiscreet. The only reason I have come to you is because my\nagents in the F.B.I. tell me that you are involved in the sinking of\nU.S.S. Alaska off the Aleutians. Thorium bombs, wasn't it? Chalmis was\na pretty smart chap and I warned our people that he was getting hot.\nNow I don't ask you why in Wotan's name the Fuehrer thinks it makes\nsense to have two intelligence services in this country. Probably\nBerlin didn't like my last reports. No, don't get excited. I've engaged\nin no subversive activities, I'm an Irish Free State citizen and if you\ngo to Washington you'll find that they know all about me. Hitler may\nwant the old Goetterdaemmerung spirit in our outfit but I can't see the\npoint of too much zeal.\"\n\nI offered him a cigarette. \"What do you want to see me about, Mr.\nRoscommon?\" I asked. \"For all you know there may be dictaphones planted\nall over the place. My last visitor today was actually a special agent\nof the F.B.I.\"\n\nRoscommon lighted his cigarette with a flick of a gold Dunhill lighter.\n\"That would be Harcourt--A. J. Harcourt--wouldn't it? A fine chap and\na conscientious agent. I'd heard he'd been assigned to your case.\nYou'll find him completely reliable. As you know, in time of war there\nhas to be _some_ practical way of maintaining direct confidential\ncommunication between the enemies. Switzerland? Bah! All milk\nchocolate, profiteering and eyewash. I wouldn't trust a Swiss as far as\nI could throw the Sub-Treasury Building. I'm acting here for Berlin and\nyou have at least three men in Berlin to keep in touch with the German\nGovernment over there. That's the only practical way modern wars can be\nfought, eh? As Edith Cavell said last time, 'Patriotism is not enough.'\nThe fact is that even in war, two great countries like Germany and\nAmerica must and do maintain direct contact.\"\n\nI pushed the button for Arthurjean. \"Miss Briggs,\" I asked, \"have we\nany brandy in the office?\"\n\nDead-pan and nonchalant, she crossed the room to a small safe,\ndisguised as a Victorian low-boy, twiddled the dials and revealed a\nneat little Frigidaire. She prepared two brandies and soda, handed\nthem to us and returned to her office.\n\n\"Prosit!\" said I.\n\n\"Heil Roosevelt!\" Roscommon answered.\n\n\"But what did you want to see me about?\" I inquired. \"_You_ may be all\nright but _I'm_ already under investigation by the F.B.I.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, old boy, nonsense,\" he reassured me. \"If they, get\ntroublesome, let me know--I'm in the phone book and my girl will always\nknow where to reach me, day or night--and I'll tell Washington to stop\nproceedings. No, Tompkins, what I wanted to tell you was that--when\nyou report back to your superior and I'll lay ten-to-one he's that\nass Ribbentrop--just tell him that the war's lost. Our game now is\nto salvage resources for the next war, which will be against Russia,\nunless I miss my guess. We've got to use these last few weeks and\ndays to rush funds, patents, papers, brains and organization out of\nthe Reich. Send them to Sweden, to Switzerland, to Italy. Fly them to\nSpain, slip them in U-boats to Buenos Aires or Dublin. Tell Ribbentrop\nthat New York understands our problem and will play the game right\nacross the board, but there must be no shilly-shallying, no nonsense\nabout 'last stands.' If Hitler wants a Siegfried finish, let him have\nit, but from now on our job is to save Germany as an asset for her\nWestern Allies and as a people whom the world will need to fight the\nSoviets. Tell him that, will you, old man? Thanks most awfully.\"\n\nRoscommon finished his drink with an expert swirl of the glass, smiled,\nshook hands and left the room as abruptly as he had arrived in it. I\npicked up the outside phone.\n\n\"Get me F.B.I. Headquarters,\" I said. \"I wish to speak to Mr. A. J.\nHarcourt. Thanks, I'll wait.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\n\"Well, there it is, Harcourt,\" I ended my recitation. \"Miss Briggs\nbelieves me, my wife doesn't, and I don't expect you to. But if you're\ninterested, I can prove I'm Frank Jacklin any number of ways.\"\n\nThe G-Man finished his drink and stared absent-mindedly at the ceiling,\nwhile Arthurjean poured him a new shot of Bourbon and water--his fifth.\n\n\"Mr. Tompkins,\" he said at last. \"I'm drinking your liquor in your\nhouse--or Miss Briggs' apartment, whichever it is--and it's not for me\nto call you a liar.\"\n\n\"Don't you dare!\" Arthurjean warned him. \"Not while I'm around, G-Man\nor no G-Man. Say, what do the initials A. J. stand for in your name?\nAbba Jabba?\"\n\n\"What do you think? Andrew Jackson, of course. No, Mr. Tompkins, I\nwon't call you a liar because, to tell the truth, I'm not sure that you\nare. Lots of funny things have happened in this war. This might have\nhappened. But I can't do anything about it.\"\n\n\"Can't you at least check on the Jacklin angle?\" I asked.\n\nHarcourt shook his head. \"Before I could do any checking, I'd have to\nreport my reasons to the chief. If I was asked for a reason, I'd have\nto explain that I had grounds for thinking that Commander Jacklin's\nsoul--and the F.B.I. has never established a policy on souls--had been\nblown from the Aleutians clear into Westchester County and is now\nrunning round in the body of Winfred S. Tompkins, stock broker. That\nreport from me would go from my chief right up to J. Edgar Hoover, the\nAttorney-General, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Cabinet and President\nRoosevelt. Now, wouldn't that look nice on my record? Wouldn't that\njust put me right in line for promotion? Be reasonable, you two. I'm\nnot saying I don't believe this yarn, but it would be worth my job to\nact like I believed it--and I got a wife and three kids in Brooklyn, no\nfooling.\"\n\nArthurjean remained silent for a few minutes, \"Andrew Jackson\nHarcourt--\" she began.\n\n\"You haven't said anything about this sinister guy Roscommon,\" I\ninterrupted. \"You could do something about him without worrying about\nme and my story.\"\n\n\"Roscommon?\" Harcourt shrugged his shoulders. \"Going after him would\nremind me of the time we hit the Governor of North Carolina with a\nGreat Smoky barbecued bear. Roscommon is all he says he is and orders\nare out not to touch him. How do you think we ought to fight this war,\nanyhow? Blind-fold?\"\n\n\"What about that Great Smoky bear?\" Arthurjean demanded irrelevantly.\n\"You-all from the South, honey-chile?\"\n\n\"The Old North State, sugar! And you?\"\n\n\"Tennessee, thank God! And the name's Arthurjean, Andy, and for the\nmillionth time I'll explain that my dad's name was Arthur and my\nmother's name was Jean, so they ran 'em together, like Johns-Manville\nor Pierce-Arrow, but it's all one word. No hyphen. So, there!\"\n\nI urged them to get over their rebel yell and come back to the subject\nof the bear.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Tompkins,\" Harcourt explained. \"It's this way. Up in the\nSmokies we have a special way of cooking bear. All you need is a bear,\na bee-tree, a two-handed saw and a stick of dynamite. First, you kill\nyour bear. That's mighty important. You skin him and you gut him and\ntruss him up like a chicken. Then you ram him up as far as you can deep\ninside a bee-tree, just below the honey, and wedge him in so he won't\nslip. Then you start a slow fire underneath him inside the tree. The\nfire sort of slow-cooks the bear, like a Dutch oven, drives off the\nbees and melts the honey-comb. The honey just naturally drips down on\nthe bear meat while she's cooking. Just about the time the tree's ready\nto fall--course, I should have explained you saw off the trunk just\nabove the honey so the bees can get away from the smoke and the old\ntree will draw like a chimney--you set a fuse to a stick of dynamite,\ntoss it in the fire and run like hell. Well, sir, the dynamite goes\noff and just naturally shoots the old roast bear out the tree like a\nprojectile. Then you pick it up, lug it back to the picnic grounds,\nand I tell you, Mr. Tompkins, it's mighty sweet eating. Now this time\nwe nigh hit the Governor of North Carolina, he was making a political\nspeech over at the old fair grounds, and--\"\n\n\"I think I get the picture, Harcourt,\" I said, cutting in on him\nrapidly. \"We did pretty much the same thing with baby seals and popcorn\nin the Aleutians. When we were after Jap subs, the depth-charges killed\nno end of baby seals--concussion, I guess. So we'd pick 'em up in a\nlife-boat, clean them, stuff them with unpopped popcorn, and stick\nthem in the fourteen-inch guns. Then we'd touch off a reduced charge\nbehind 'em. Seals are naturally oily so they went out the muzzle like\na regular shell. The intense heat of the explosion not only cooked the\nseal but popped the popcorn. That puffed out, set up air resistance and\nreduced trajectory. Then we'd send a helicopter out to pick 'em up and\nhave 'em in mess. Cold with chili sauce, they were delicious. One time\nwhen we were bombarding Attu, the crew of No. 3 turret forgot we had a\nseal in the center gun and fired it at a Jap redoubt. It hit--\"\n\n\"I can see,\" Arthurjean remarked, \"that I've been missing a lot of fun\nhere in New York, though I'll never forget the time we pretended we\nfound a dead mouse in a mince pie at the Waldorf--Now, who in hell can\n_that_ be?\"\n\nThe door-bell rang insistently.\n\nHarcourt looked a little uneasy. \"I thought it might save a lot of time\nand trouble,\" he said, \"if I asked Mrs. Tompkins to meet us here. I\ntold her that Miss Briggs was a friend of mine--sugar, you'd better\ngo in the other room and put on red night-things--so you don't need\nsomething more _de trop_ than those to worry, Mr. Tompkins.\"\n\n\"That's just dandy, Harcourt,\" I agreed. \"Did you ever see a wife who\ncouldn't spot a sex-situation at a hundred yards up-wind on a dark and\nrainy night?\"\n\n\"Can't say I did,\" the Special Agent admitted, \"but I've never had but\none wife and she's busy with the kids.\"\n\nThere was a knock on the door and Harcourt opened it with a courtly\nmanner.\n\n\"Come right in, Mrs. Tompkins,\" he said. \"My friend, Miss Briggs, is in\nthe other room and will be out in a moment. Mr. Tompkins and I--\"\n\n\"This,\" said Germaine, \"is Mrs. Rutherford. After Winnie didn't turn\nup for a couple of nights, we put our heads together and decided that\ntwo could worry as cheaply as one. So when I got your message, I just\nphoned Virginia and here we are. Hullo, Winnie, is this another of your\nhomes away from home?\"\n\nVirginia Rutherford looked pretty much the way a roasting bear in a\nbee-tree might be expected to feel while waiting for the dynamite to\nexplode: very sweet, red-hot and not giving a damn whether she hit the\nGovernor of the Old North State.\n\n\"Hullo, Winnie,\" she remarked dangerously. \"This another of your\ntousled blondes?\"\n\n\"I resent that,\" Arthurjean said from the doorway. \"This is _my_\nflat and I didn't invite you and I'll have you know that I'm a very\nrespectable--well, rather respectable--working girl.\"\n\nThe effect of virtue was only slightly marred by the fact that, as she\nspoke, a pair of silk panties slowly but inexorably slid below the hem\nof her skirt and settled in a shimmer at her feet. Arthurjean looked\ndown.\n\n\"Oh, hell, girls,\" she said, \"What's the use? Have a drink!\"\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Briggs,\" Germaine replied. \"I will. Make mine straight\nScotch and the same for Mrs. Rutherford. Are you, by any chance,\nemployed in my husband's office?\"\n\n\"I'm his secretary,\" Arthurjean admitted.\n\n\"Winnie,\" Jimmie turned on me with a snap like those doors in Penn\nStation which open by an electric eye, \"and you swore that you had\nnothing to do with the office-girls. I was fool enough to believe you.\"\n\n\"At the time, dear,\" I explained guiltily, \"I didn't know it myself.\"\n\nHarcourt came lumbering to my rescue. \"Before you leap to any\nconclusions, Mrs. Tompkins,\" he urged, \"I think I ought to explain that\nI represent the F.B.I. and that Mr. Tompkins came here today at my\nrequest. Your husband happens to be in very serious trouble under the\nEspionage Act. I personally am convinced that there's been a mistake\nand that he's innocent, but my opinion is of no value unless I can\nfind evidence to support it.\"\n\n\"What's he done?\" Virginia Rutherford asked eagerly. \"Will he go to\njail?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, Mrs. Rutherford,\" Harcourt replied, \"I'm not allowed\nto discuss the nature of the charges against him. No formal indictment\nhas been lodged and if you can help me, none will be made. The\nimportant thing is to know where he was and what he was doing from the\ntwenty-fifth of March until the second of April.\"\n\n\"Why the twenty-fifth of March?\" my wife demanded. \"He was with me at\nBedford Hills most of that time. I, and the maid at the house, Myrtle,\ncan testify to that. I don't think he went to the office much that\nweek. It was Holy Week. He and I went to church.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Tompkins,\" he said, \"you are a true and noble lady. It's just too\nbad that one of our agents has already interviewed the Hubble girl, who\ntestified that Mr. Tompkins didn't come home once all that week.\"\n\nGermaine sank back in her chair and looked at me with an air of\nmisplaced consecration. \"Winnie,\" she urged, \"go ahead and tell him\nwhere you were. I'm your wife and I don't care what silliness you were\nup to or what woman you were with, just so they don't send you to\nprison.\"\n\nI smiled at her. \"Jimmie,\" I replied, \"I give you my word, I simply\ndon't remember. I don't know where I was. As I told you the other day,\nI've drawn a blank as to what happened before last Monday afternoon.\"\n\nMrs. Rutherford took advantage of the moment of incredulous silence\nwhich followed this announcement.\n\n\"Don't try to be chivalrous, Winnie,\" she urged me. \"We hadn't planned\nto advertise it, Jimmie, but Winnie spent that week with me. He rented\na flat for me uptown, Mr. Harcourt, about six weeks ago, and we put in\na whole week together. I daresay you think I'm a loose woman but--\"\n\nHarcourt looked quite painfully embarrassed. \"I surely do not want to\ncontradict a lady,\" he told her, \"but the Bureau checked up on that\napartment yesterday. The janitor and the cleaning woman both stated\nthat, except for last Monday afternoon and evening when you were there\nby yourself, neither you nor Mr. Tompkins had been near the place for\nat least two weeks. The bed linen and the bath towels hadn't been used\nand the food in the ice-box was stale. There had been no garbage.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" flared Virginia, \"of all the low-down snoopers!\"\n\n\"The country's at war, Mrs. Rutherford,\" the Special Agent replied.\n\"And while I'm at it I might as well save Miss Briggs the trouble of\ntelling me that Mr. Tompkins spent that week here with her. He did not.\nWe've checked this apartment house most thoroughly, as well as Mr.\nTompkins' office.\"\n\n\"Why that particular week?\" I asked.\n\nHarcourt turned to me apologetically. \"In view of your earlier\nstatements to me,\" he declared, \"I'm sure you will understand this\nexplanation. A certain ship did not sail from a certain port until the\n26th of March. A certain article was not delivered on board that ship\nuntil after she had sailed. Before then, the individual who brought\nthe article to the ship had no knowledge which ship had been selected.\nBefore then, nobody on that ship had any knowledge that any article\nwould be brought on board and had no knowledge of the nature of its\nvoyage. Whatever arrangements were made must have been made during the\nfollowing few days. That, at any rate, is the working theory the Bureau\nhas adopted. Have you no idea of where you might have been in that\nperiod, Mr. Tompkins?\"\n\nI placed my head in my hands and thought back to that misty morning\nten days before, when the Alaska pulled out of Bremerton Navy Yard and\nheaded north through Puget Sound for Victoria and the Strait of Juan\nde Fuca. I remembered how, as we returned recognition signals to the\nCanadian base at Esquimault, a destroyer had put out, come alongside\nand put a civilian passenger aboard us. I remembered the fuss he raised\non the bridge while we made a lee for the destroyer and hoisted a large\npacking-case on board, and how it was hurried below decks with a Marine\nguard. Then I thought of the run out west, past Dutch Harbor and Adak,\nour light carrier slipping through the drifting fogs of the Aleutians,\nwhile the slow Pacific swell pounded against our port beam and the\nturbines whined and ship shook and the icy wind whipped across the\nflight-deck. And I remembered that last night in the mess when Windy\nSmith--of Texas, naturally--boasted that he--\n\n\"No, Mr. Harcourt,\" I told him, \"I'm afraid that the things I remember\nwouldn't help either of us. You go ahead and see what you can find out\nabout me, and so will I.\"\n\n\"Winnie,\" Germaine said reproachfully. \"Tell him where you were, dear.\nIt's no use pretending that you don't remember. I know that you can\nexplain. I know there's nothing _really_ wrong.\"\n\nArthurjean walked across and put her hand on Jimmie's arm. \"You'd\nbetter have another drink, Mrs. Tompkins,\" she remarked, \"and so had I.\nThis sort of thing is tough to take.\"\n\nVirginia looked up brightly at Harcourt. \"If Winnie won't help himself,\nI will,\" she said. \"I'll find out what the big dope was doing and when\nI do--look out!\"\n\n\"Come on, Jimmie,\" I told my wife. \"Let's go home. I've had about as\nmuch of this as I can stand. Harcourt, you know where you can reach me,\nif you get the word from Washington. In the meantime, why don't you\nfollow up that Roscommon angle? That's the best lead I've struck.\"\n\nHarcourt finished his Bourbon. \"Mr. Tompkins,\" he observed, \"you're\nquite right but there isn't a single thing I can do about it. We've had\ntop-level orders to lay off that guy and with the Bureau, orders is\norders.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\nWhen I entered my office on Monday morning, the genteel receptionist\ninformed me with some austerity that Mr. Roscommon was waiting for me.\n\n\"Okay, send him in,\" I directed, bracing myself for what would probably\nbe a stormy interview. If Roscommon was as well-informed as he claimed\nto be, he must know that I had already reported him to the F.B.I.\n\n\"Smart work, Tompkins!\" he beamed, giving my hand a vise-like squeeze.\n\"Working as I do with the highest echelons, I'm afraid I sometimes\nforget the value of naivet\u00e9. You couldn't have invented anything better\ncalculated to slow down the Bureau than to report me as a Nazi agent.\nEven the Director was impressed, though he'll see through your ruse\nafter a couple of days.\"\n\n\"Is that what you wanted to tell me?\" I inquired, \"because your visit\nwill certainly arouse new suspicions. I assume I'm still under F.B.I.\nobservation.\"\n\nAxel Roscommon smiled. \"Nothing to worry about, old boy, I assure\nyou. Naturally you'll have to go to Washington sooner or later and\nexplain things there. I suggest that you go next week, when the whole\nAdministration will be in a state of maximum confusion.\"\n\nI asked him whether that would be any change.\n\n\"Absolutely, old boy. The war's been managed quite impressively well up\nto now. After this week, with Roosevelt out of the way, things will\nbegin to fall apart and there will be plenty of pickings but the war is\nalready won, so that won't hurt.\"\n\nRoosevelt, I observed, was down in Georgia, according to the papers,\nbut that didn't mean he couldn't keep in touch with things in\nWashington.\n\nRoscommon stood close against my desk and leaned forward on his hands,\nfacing me. \"Listen carefully, old boy,\" he said, \"and keep this to\nyourself. Roosevelt will be dead before the week's out--on Friday the\nthirteenth if there's any symmetry to be expected in this crazy world.\nIt's the same stuff they gave Woodrow Wilson over at Paris in the\nspring of 1919. You may remember that chap Yardley wrote a book, 'The\nAmerican Black Chamber,' and told how the American Intelligence got\nword of a plot to poison Wilson by one of America's allies. Not long\nafter, Wilson had a slight illness and a few months later had a stroke,\nas they called it. You see your American Constitution--marvelous\ndocument, that!--makes absolutely no bloody provision for the illness\nof a President, and Wilson's paralysis paralyzed your government\nfor nearly two years, while America's allies cleaned up on the\npeace-arrangements.\n\n\"Roosevelt is tougher than Wilson was. They slipped him the first dose\nat Teheran early last year. When he came back that spring he had a\nslight illness--they called it influenza--and he was never quite the\nsame. Except for a few trusted social associates, close friends and\nmembers of the family, he was kept in strict seclusion. Then, with\nhis amazing vitality, he began to throw off the stuff and staged a\nmagnificent political campaign last fall. So they had to try again at\nYalta early this year. The second time they gave him too much. He had\none bad attack on the cruiser coming back from the Mediterranean. When\nhe addressed Congress, he had the same gaunt look and thick speech\nthat Wilson had towards the end. The final stroke is due this week and\nhas been held off only because he's taking things easy. No, old chap,\nRoosevelt's doomed and all I can tell you is that the Germans had no\npart in it. Only five men in America know about this, and F.D.R. is one\nof them.\"\n\n\"You're talking utter piffle,\" I replied. \"I can see how Hitler or Tojo\nmight want to get rid of Roosevelt but who else? Why don't you warn the\nauthorities. Or I could.\"\n\nRoscommon smiled rather sadly. \"What good would it do? There's no\nantidote after the first twenty-four hours. If Roosevelt hasn't warned\nthem, why should you? All that would happen would be to put yourself\nunder the blackest kind of suspicion. Just fancy the reaction of the\nAmerican Intelligence. You march in and say, 'See here, the President's\nbeen poisoned and will die before the end of the week.' They promptly\ncall for an ambulance and an alienist and send you to St. Elizabeth's\nfor observation. Then the President does die. 'By the Lord Harry!' they\nthink, 'this chap we locked up said Roosevelt would die and now he has\ndied. He probably had a hand in it himself. Let's fix him just to be\nsafe!'\"\n\nI nodded. \"Yes, I can see that,\" I agreed. \"Look at what happened when\nLincoln was assassinated. But if I'm not to pass word on to anybody,\nwhat's the point of telling me about it--assuming it to be true, which\nI doubt?\"\n\n\"Naturally you doubt me, my boy, naturally. All you need do is to wait\nuntil Friday the thirteenth and if I'm right you'll know it and if I'm\nwrong you'll know it. But I assure you that I am not wrong. The war is\nover and Roosevelt is the only obstacle to certain long-range practical\narrangements for organizing the peace. The Old World, mind you, doesn't\nlike outsiders like Wilson and Roosevelt telling them what to do with\nvictory. From now on, America is going to be immobilized. It's all\nrather simple, really, but I haven't time to explain how simple it is\nbecause the explanation is bloody complicated.\"\n\n\"You still haven't told me why you have passed on this fantastic story\nto me,\" I pointed out.\n\n\"Oh, that? It's just this, my boy. Sell the war short! Sell it\nshort! You must use all the funds that Ribbentrop gave you to get\na real nest-egg. With Germany defeated, our intelligence will need\nfunds--decentralized funds--and this is your chance to do an important\njob. I don't care what the Foreign Minister told you to do with the\nmoney. Forget him--he's a dead duck, anyway. Just take the cash and\nsell the war short. Make a killing and then we'll be able to finance\nfuture operations.\"\n\nAfter Roscommon had made another of his abrupt departures, I buzzed for\nArthurjean and told her to ask my partners to come in.\n\nWasson was the same as he had been before--plump, dark-haired and\nenergetic. Philip Cone was taller, fair-haired, blue-eyed, with a quiet\nmanner and a sleepy expression.\n\n\"Morning, Graham. Morning, Phil,\" I greeted them. \"The other day,\nGraham, you got peeved because I wanted to go slow on the Fynch\nportfolio. I only had a hunch then but I knew we'd better not rush into\none of our regular reinvestment run-arounds. Now I've made a check and\nI see the new line. Boys, from now on, we've got to sell the war short.\"\n\n\"What do you mean 'sell the war short?'\" Wasson demanded. \"The Japs are\ngood for another year and those Nazis are fighting pretty damn well,\ntoo. You don't mean to go America First, separate peace or any of that\nrot, do you?\"\n\n\"You know me better than that,\" I reproved him. \"No. My tip is that the\nGermans will surrender within a month and the Japs before Labor Day.\nWhat do we do to clean up?\"\n\n\"Je-sus!\" Cone drawled appreciatively. \"The bottom will drop out of the\nmarket!\"\n\n\"No, Phil it won't,\" Wasson objected. \"They won't let it. That would be\nan admission that Wall Street is cashing in on the war.\"\n\n\"Well, aren't we cashing in?\" asked Cone, \"I haven't heard a single\nbroker or banker committing suicide since Pearl Harbor.\"\n\n\"Nuts to that talk!\" Wasson replied. \"No, Winnie, my point is that Wall\nStreet can't afford a peace-scare selling wave, and if stocks start to\ndrop the big boys will move in and support the market.\"\n\n\"How about commodities, Graham?\" I asked. \"You know that end of the\nbusiness. The whole world will be hungry and naked. Can't we move in\nthere without risk?\"\n\nWesson laughed bitterly. \"There will be only about eighteen governments\nand government boards riding herd on you every time you move in with\nreal money in that racket. Anyhow, they tell me that this guy Roosevelt\nhas ordered the F.B.I. to move in on the Black Market.\"\n\n\"Well, boys,\" I observed, \"the way you put it we can't do a damn thing\nto make money out of the same kind of tip-off that set the House of\nRothschild up for a hundred years after the Battle of Waterloo. That\ndoesn't make sense.\"\n\nPhil Cone smiled sheepishly. \"Oh, I wouldn't say that, Winnie. We can\ncash in but we'll have to step out of our field. We could shift a\nmillion dollars to Canada. You can get a Canadian dollar for ninety\ncents American. A year from now it will be back to par. That's better\nthan ten percent on your money in less than a year.\"\n\n\"What about South America?\" I asked.\n\n\"Lay off the Latins, Winnie,\" Wasson advised me. \"Brazil's the only\ncountry in South America that's good for the long pull and just now is\nno time to monkey with Brazil. They've got some politics just now.\"\n\nI considered things a bit. \"Let's see if we can figure out a way to\nmake a quick killing,\" I said. \"Suppose, for example, something drastic\nhappened--like Roosevelt dying on one of his plane-trips--to mark the\nend of some of these controls. What would happen to the market?\"\n\nWasson chuckled. \"If that guy popped off, there'd be dancing in Wall\nStreet and you'd have to shut down the Exchange because the ticker\ncouldn't keep up with the buying orders. Prices would go higher than\nthe Empire State Building. Hell! They'd hit the stratosphere.\"\n\n\"Is that your opinion, Phil?\" I asked.\n\nCone shook his head. \"Only a few suckers would feel like that, Winnie,\"\nhe told me. \"The big-time operators would be shivering in their boots.\nAs long as F.D.R. is in the White House there's no limit to what they\ncan make out of the war. If Roosevelt died now, you'd see the bottom\ndrop out of the market and the damndest wave of labor strikes we've had\nsince 1890.\"\n\n\"Damn it, Phil,\" I objected. \"I wish you and Graham would get together\non this one. I can't quite follow all your ideas. Business conditions\nand war-orders would continue, wouldn't they?\"\n\nCone shook his head again. \"No,\" he insisted. \"The business community's\ngot confidence in Roosevelt. Sure he's a tough baby, sure he's got a\nlot of dumb Harvard men sore at him, sure he's got the labor leaders\n_and_ the G.I.'s rooting for him. But he's done a good job with the\nwar, he's let people make money and some of his best friends are\nmulti-millionaires, like Astor and Harriman. If he was to die, we'd\nhave this Missouri guy--whatsisname? Truman?--and what can he offer?\"\n\n\"Got any comment on that, Graham?\" I asked.\n\n\"The way Phil puts it, it sounds reasonable,\" Wasson admitted, \"but\nI still say that the first reaction to anything like that would be a\nbuying wave which would send the market way up.\"\n\nI considered for a couple of minutes. \"I can't say I agree with you,\"\nI said at last. \"The big boys wouldn't let that happen any more than\nthey'd let a peace-scare knock the bottom out of the market. What would\nlabor and the G. I.'s think and do if they read that the Stock Market\nquotations went over the top at a thing like that.\"\n\n\"Well, Winnie,\" Cone observed. \"It isn't likely to happen.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" I agreed. \"However, I think it would be a good idea to\nwork out a representative list of industrials and go short on the\nmarket generally for the next thirty days. We can unload the Fynch\nportfolio as a starter. We ought to be able to pick up two or three\nhundred thousand if we work it right.\"\n\nCone nodded. \"Graham and I will go to work on it now, and we'll have\nthe list ready before start of business tomorrow morning. That will be\nthe tenth, won't it?\"\n\nWasson looked uneasy. \"I don't like it so much, Winnie,\" he said, \"but\nI've never seen you lose money on a hunch yet so I'll string along.\nCome on, Phil, this is a hell of a big war we're trying to sell short.\nLet's hope we don't fall flat on our face.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\nThe phone rang. \"Mr. Tompkins?\" A girl's voice inquired. \"Just a\nmoment, Mr. Willamer of the Securities and Exchange Commission will\nspeak to you.\"\n\nI didn't like that \"will.\" \"And who the hell, Arthurjean, is Mr.\nWillamer of the S.E.C.?\" I asked in an aside.\n\n\"The woiks,\" she said.\n\n\"Hullo, Tompkins,\" a clear phonogenic baritone inquired. \"This is Harry\nWillamer. I saw your list of selling-orders this morning and wondered\nif you would drop in and see me.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I said. \"Shall I bring my books?\"\n\n\"Not necessary. This is entirely informal. As a matter of fact, I have\nsome gentlemen from Washington whom I think you will be interested in\nmeeting. This is entirely unofficial, of course.\"\n\n\"How about meeting me at the Pond Club at one o'clock?\"\n\n\"That will be grand,\" Mr. Willamer answered heartily. \"The Pond Club at\none o'clock it is.\"\n\nI turned to Arthurjean. \"What kind of go-round is this? I start selling\nand inside an hour the S.E.C. is on my tail. Isn't speculation legal\nany more?\"\n\n\"Baby,\" she remarked, \"anything's legal as long as you're in with the\nright guys. All I can tell you is that Willamer is hot stuff. His aunt\nis a cousin of Jesse Jones or maybe it's Henry Morgenthau. So you watch\nyourself and don't do any talking out of turn.\"\n\nIt was Tuesday, the 10th, and I had launched my plan of selling the war\nshort in a determined campaign to unload G.M. and U.S. Steel. I was\nwell covered in case of a rise, but there was already a million dollars\nof the firm's money in the operation, behind the Fynch million which I\nhad used to break the ice.\n\nThe Pond Club was the same as ever. Tammy was polishing the glasses in\nhis little bar and there were no fellow-members in evidence. After all,\nI decided, they weren't likely to show up much before three o'clock.\nHowever, I decided that privacy was called for, especially if Commander\nTolan put in an appearance.\n\n\"Tammy,\" I explained, as he produced his usual pick-me-up and waited\nfor me to down it. \"I'm expecting some gentlemen to join me in a few\nminutes. Is there a room where we could have a private conversation and\nstill get something to drink?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, Mr. Tompkins,\" the steward said, \"I think I could let you\nuse the Minnow Room. That's private and there's a dumbwaiter to the\nbar. Just push the buzzer and say what you want in the phone and I'll\nsend it right up to you.\"\n\n\"It sounds like perfection,\" I told him. \"I'll go on up to the Minnow\nRoom. The gentleman I'm expecting is named Willamer and he'll have\nsome friends with him. Just send them up when they arrive. How do you\nget there?\"\n\nTammy looked a trifle startled. \"That's where you had your bachelor\ndinner, sir,\" he reproved me. \"Up the stairs and first door to your\nleft, sir. You'll remember it when you see it, I'm quite sure.\"\n\nTammy was right. No one who had ever seen the Pond Club's Minnow Room\nwas likely to forget it. The wall on one side was lined solid with\nilluminated tanks containing gold-fish making fishy little zeros with\ntheir stupid mouths. The other walls were enlivened by frescoes of\ndrunken fish in various hilarious attitudes. Indirect lighting gave a\nsort of Black Mass or Diabolical Fish-Fry effect to the whole. It was\ndefinitely not a room to stay sober in.\n\n\"Tompkins?\" The door opened and an egg-smooth young man with a baldish\nhead and pale eyebrows stood in the entrance. \"I'm Harry Willamer. Meet\nthe rest of the gang. Here's Winston Sales of the War Production Board,\nLieutenant-Colonel George Finogan of the Army Quartermaster Corps and\nCommander Raymond Coonley of the Navy Bureau of Supplies.\"\n\nExcept for the uniforms, they might have been cousins--they were all\nfattish, baldish and blondish. They were all egg-like men, middle-aged,\nall hearty in manner and all seemed to have no particular reason for\nexisting.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" I asked, \"what will you have to drink?\"\n\n\"Scotch-and-soda,\" said Willamer. \"Hell, let's make it Scotch for\neveryone and save trouble.\"\n\n\"I'd like a whiskey sour,\" objected Commander Coonley. \"I've got\nbutterflies in my stomach after working with those hot-shots from\nDetroit last night.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Willamer accepted the amendment. \"One whiskey sour. Any other\nchanges?\"\n\nThere were none, so I signaled to Tammy and our order was filled.\n\n\"Tompkins,\" Willamer remarked. \"You'll excuse this short notice but\nwhen I spotted your selling-orders in the market this morning I knew we\nhad to move fast. First of all, I'd like to know why you are selling,\nwhen everybody else is buying.\"\n\n\"Mr. Willamer,\" I explained, \"it's none of the S.E.C.'s goddamned\nbusiness what or why I sell so long as I follow the regulations.\"\n\nWillamer laughed. \"Who said anything about the S.E.C.?\" he demanded.\n\"Oh, I get it. You thought this was an informal investigation by the\nCommission. Right? My fault. Should have told you that this has nothing\nto do with your firm's market-position or the S.E.C.\"\n\nI took a reflective swallow of Scotch. \"Then what the hell _is_ this?\"\nI asked.\n\nHarry Willamer drew himself up, \"We,\" he explained, \"are the Inter-Alia\nTrading Corporation. Your selling orders suggest that you don't expect\nthe war to last much longer.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" I told him.\n\n\"Neither do we,\" Willamer continued. \"That's why we've been busy\norganizing Inter-Alia. It's a neat set-up. Sales here, on the War\nProduction Board, is in a position to advise us of all cut-backs in\nwar-contracts and keep in touch with the whole contract-termination\nprogram. Colonel Finogan is in the Quartermaster Corps and is the only\nman in the Army--\"\n\n\"In the world, Harry,\" Finogan corrected him.\n\n\"Right you are, George, in the world--who knows where all the surplus\nwar-stocks are located. His office routes them to the depots. That\nin itself is worth a million dollars to the company. Anything from\njeeps to nylons, Colonel Finogan knows where they are and what price\nwill buy them. Commander Coonley is in the same position on Navy\nSupplies. Between him and Finogan there isn't an ounce of anything from\nparachute-silk to bull-dozers which we can't locate. As for me, I watch\nthe way money and markets move here in Wall Street.\"\n\nI finished my drink. \"That sounds wonderful, Mr. Willamer, but what\nhas it got to do with me? You have the makings of a ten million dollar\ncorporation between the four of you.\"\n\nWillamer raised a soft, white, well-manicured hand in a\ntraffic-stopping gesture. \"All but one thing, Tompkins,\" he said.\n\"We haven't got working capital to exploit this set-up. That's where\nyou come in. Tompkins, Wasson & Cone controls between three and\nfive million dollars and are smart operators. So long as you stuck\nto conservative methods, no dice for Inter-Alia, but when I saw you\ngambling on the early end of the war, I said to myself, this is where\nwe can do business with Tompkins.\"\n\n\"How much do you need?\" I asked.\n\n\"Three hundred thousand would be enough to start with,\" Willamer\nreckoned.\n\n\"Half a million,\" Finogan amended.\n\n\"Say you need half a million to start with and I put it up, what do I\nget out of it?\" I demanded.\n\nWillamer looked a little secretive. \"Well, Tompkins,\" he admitted.\n\"You'll get good security for your money, of course, and a share in\nwhat we make. Say a fifth, since there are four of us in it already.\"\n\n\"That sounds reasonable,\" I agreed, \"assuming you have a sure thing.\nWhat's your first operation, once you get the money in Inter-Alia to\nfinance it?\"\n\nWillamer looked still more secretive. \"That is a firm secret,\nTompkins,\" he told me. \"If you decide to come in with us, I'll let you\nin on our plans, but this thing is too big to talk about until we see\nthe color of your money.\"\n\nI stood up. \"Well, then, gentlemen,\" I announced, \"will you have one\nmore round of drinks and then kindly get the hell out of here? I'm\ndelighted to have met you personally but I don't see the point of\nwasting our time unless I know what I am putting my money into.\"\n\n\"Tell him, Harry,\" Sales urged. \"We can trust Tompkins not to take\nadvantage of our plans. The way we're set up we could block him easy\nif he tried to double-cross us.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" I said. \"It's your plan and you have the inside track.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" Willamer explained, \"here's our first operation. The\nArmy and Navy have huge stocks of atabrine and quinine--left over from\nAfrica and the South-west Pacific. As soon as the fighting stops,\nColonel Finogan and Commander Coonley will declare these stocks surplus\nto be sold at spot-sales where they are. We will be the only bidders\nand we get a world-corner on malaria. The whole world needs that stuff\nand if we move fast, during the confusion after victory, we can sew it\nup and make the world pay our price. We ought to double our money in\nthree months.\"\n\n\"Double!\" snorted Sales. \"We ought to quintuple it like Papa Dionne.\nSouth America is just lousy with dollars and here's a way to get 'em\nback home. Malaria's a big item down there. No quinine, no oil.\"\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" I told the Inter-Alia boys, \"I'll have to think\nit over. As Mr. Willamer knows, I'm pretty heavily committed in the\npresent market. Get in touch with me about the end of the month and\nI might be able to put--say, twenty thousand dollars--into your\nproposition.\"\n\nWillamer smiled unpleasantly. \"Come, Tompkins,\" he said, \"you can do\nmuch better than that. Perhaps you don't realize that the S.E.C. might\njust decide to investigate your firm's market-position. You can afford\nto put in at least $100,000 now and, when you get out of your present\noperation, make up the balance of that half million.\"\n\nI went to the dumbwaiter and pushed the buzzer. \"Tammy,\" I spoke into\nthe phone, \"will you come up here and show these gentlemen out of the\nclub. We've finished our talk.\"\n\n\"Nothing doing,\" I said to the others. \"I don't shake down well.\"\n\nWillamer blinked his watery blue eyes at me. \"That's libelous,\" he\nstated. \"I'm a lawyer and I ought to know. You can't accuse me of\nblackmail in the presence of witnesses. By God, Tompkins, I'll have the\nexaminers in your office at nine o'clock tomorrow morning. And I'll sue\nyou for damages.\"\n\n\"Oh no, you won't,\" I informed him. \"I didn't call you a blackmailer\nand I doubt that your friends will care to testify. You didn't\nknow--perhaps I forgot to mention it--but this room is wired for\ndictaphones and a complete phonographic record of this conversation is\nalready on wire. I'll send it over to the F.B.I. in the morning, unless\nyou--\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Harry,\" said Commander Coonley with an air of decision. \"I\ndidn't hear any reference to blackmail by Mr. Tompkins. I'd better be\ngetting back to my office.\"\n\n\"Me, too,\" chimed Lt. Col. George Finogan.\n\n\"Nice to have met you, Tompkins,\" Winston Sales observed as he strode\nbriskly for the exit.\n\nHarry Willamer turned to me, not without dignity. \"You son of a bitch!\"\nhe remarked feelingly, and followed the others.\n\nI waited until it was reasonably sure that the Inter-Alia group had\nleft the building. Then I went downstairs to the bar and found Tammy\nalone.\n\n\"Tammy,\" I said. \"You overheard our conversation down the dummy, didn't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Oh no, sir. Not at all, Mr. Tompkins. I--\"\n\n\"Of course you did, Tammy. You heard these gentlemen try to blackmail\nme and you heard me tell them to go to hell, didn't you?\"\n\nI languidly waved a twenty-dollar bill under his snubby nose.\n\n\"Now that you put it that way, sir,\" the little bar-steward admitted,\n\"I do remember hearing that Mr. Willamer say that unless you gave him\n$100,000 he'd start investigating your books.\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" I congratulated him. \"Just remember that, when the time\ncomes. Now see if you can get me Mr. Merriwether Vail on the phone.\nHe's in the Manhattan Directory--a lawyer.\"\n\n\"Merry?\" I asked, after we had been connected. \"I have a feeling I'm\ngoing to need your legal services.... No, it's not that one ... it's\nanother kind of jam ... I'm being blackmailed.... No, you dope, it's\nnot a woman, it's an official.... Yes, I'll stick here until you can\nget over.... What shall I order for you, a double Scotch?... Right! At\nthe Pond Club.\"\n\nThere was one more move to make. I called Bedford Hills,\nperson-to-person call, and asked for my wife. After the usual duel\nbetween local and suburban operators, Jimmie's voice answered.\n\"Winnie,\" she said. \"Thank goodness you telephoned me. You'd better\ncome out at once. The most dreadful things have been happening.\"\n\n\"It's not so wonderful here either,\" I told her. \"Listen, Jimmie, you\ncome on in--\"\n\n\"It's Ponto,\" she said, paying absolutely no attention to what I was\nsaying. \"He's drunk--yes, drunk! He managed to upset that decanter of\nold brandy you keep on your night table and lapped it up. Now he's\nhowling and hiccoughing like mad and I'm afraid to go near him.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jimmie, to hell with Ponto. Let him sleep it off. You come on\nin to town. We've got to do some fast thinking. I'll meet you in the\nLittle Bar at the Ritz at five o'clock. Bring your night things, and\nmine, too. We may have to leave town in a hurry. I'll explain when I\nsee you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\nMerry Vail listened to my account of the encounter with the Inter-Alia\ngang and then rolled his eyes toward heaven.\n\n\"Poor old Winnie!\" he expostulated. \"Why didn't you try something\ncomparatively safe, like robbing a she bear of her whelps or yelling\n'Hurray for Hitler' in Union Square? Harry Willamer is a vindictive guy\nand his aunt or his mother-in-law is related to Jesse Jones. At least\nthat's what the Street believes.\"\n\n\"What can he do to me?\" I asked. \"I have him cold on a charge of\nblackmail.\"\n\n\"Like hell you do!\" said Merry. \"First thing he'll check with the\nF.B.I. to find out if there is a recording of your talk. And there\nisn't. So it's your word and Tammy's against that of four high-ranking\ngovernment officials. You ask what they can do to you? You just call\nPhil Cone at your office and see if they haven't started doing it\nalready.\"\n\nThe steward made the phone connection and in a few minutes Cone's\nlanguid voice was complaining over the wire.\n\n\"Say, Winnie, what the hell have you been up to?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Phil. Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"It's just that the word's been passed to lay off Tompkins, Wasson\n& Cone. The brokers don't want to handle our orders. You know Manny\nOppenheimer of Auchincloss, Morton, Caton, Beauregard & Oppenheimer?\nYou know how he used to lick your boots if you stood still long enough\nfor him to kneel down and stick his tongue out? Well, Manny cut me.\nYeah, that's right. Cut me! What's cooking? Even my best friends won't\ntell me whether it's B.O. or dishpan hands.\"\n\n\"Just keep on plugging, Phil,\" I urged. \"They can't refuse to handle\nour orders if we insist. I'll put in some calls on this.... Yeah, I'm\nup at the Pond Club with my attorney ... I'll try to call you back.\nThat guy Willamer is back of this because I wouldn't go along with his\nproposition.\"\n\n\"Oh-oh!\" Phil observed dismally. \"That's enough for me. Think I'd\nbetter join the Marines?\"\n\n\"You keep away from the recruiting-sergeant until we finish this\noperation,\" I told him.\n\nI turned to Vail. \"Merry,\" I said, \"this is one for you to handle.\nBrokers are trying to get out of handling our orders and tenth-raters\nlike Manny Oppenheimer are high-hatting Phil Cone. You put in a call\nand find out what it's all about.\"\n\nVail meditated. \"Okay,\" he said at last. \"You understand I'm acting as\nyour attorney now?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I agreed.\n\nHe dialed a number. \"I'd like to speak to the U.S. Attorney's office,\"\nhe told the switch-board operator. \"Yes, I'll wait.... Yes.... Oh,\nNed?... This is Merry Vail. I've been retained by Winfred Tompkins.\nWhat I want to know is whether there are any charges against him....\nYeah, he's with me now.... No, he won't try to leave town. Suspicion of\nkidnapping?... No fooling?... That's cockeyed.... Listen, counselor, my\nclient is innocent and stands ready to answer all charges--\"\n\nHe turned to me. \"Hell, he hung up!\"\n\n\"What was that about kidnapping?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, something completely screw-ball,\" my attorney said. \"It's only\nthat his office has received an anonymous charge accusing you of having\nkidnapped Winnie Tompkins and masquerading in his place. Ned also told\nme you were in trouble with other governmental agencies and said he'd\nsee me in court.\"\n\n\"Damn!\" I objected. \"That sounds like Virginia Rutherford's idea of\na snappy way to find out where I was before Easter. It doesn't make\nsense. If I kidnapped Tompkins, who am I supposed to be? I'm ready to\ntake a finger-print test any time, even with these bandages on my right\nhand.\"\n\nVail clucked his tongue. \"That attitude won't help,\" he said. \"If you\ndon't look out they'll say your prints prove that you're the man who\nkidnapped Charley Ross. No, Ned is full of prunes and he doesn't put\nmuch stock in this kidnapping angle, but the wolves are after you all\nright. Now I've passed the word, you can't leave the State, of course.\"\n\n\"Damn you, Merry,\" I objected. \"I never told you--\"\n\n\"You retained me, Winnie. That's enough. You'd be a damn fool to pull\nout now. Every G-man in America would be after you. My advice is\nto stick around. Today's the eleventh, Wednesday. Well, you have a\nweek-end coming up, so you might just as well go on commuting between\nyour office and Bedford Hills as be pulled off the fast freight at\nOneonta.\"\n\n\"Damn that Rutherford woman!\" I remarked. \"She is the one who turned\nme in to the District Attorney. Up to now I've just had a few friendly\npasses from a nice guy from the F.B.I.\"\n\n\"I can't advise you on the subject of your sex life,\" Vail said. \"But\nyou have nothing to fear if you remember to cultivate a clean-cut manly\nexpression and an air of amazed innocence as you tell the Judge, 'Not\nguilty, your Honor, and I reserve my defense.'\"\n\n\"What shall I tell Phil Cone, though?\" I asked.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I'll put in another call,\" Vail said. He dialed\nanother number. \"I want to speak to Joe,\" he said. \"Yes. Joe. Tell him\nit's Merry Vail.... Joe, this is Merry.... Same to you. Say, what's all\nthis b.s. about Winnie Tompkins.... Oh ... the hell you say!... I don't\nbelieve.... No, that's definitely not true.... If it was anybody but\nyou, Joe, I'd advise him to sue for libel.... Yeah, he's my client....\nOf course he's innocent.... Lay you five-to-one in thousands he is....\nDone!\"\n\nVail turned back to me. \"That was the chief fixer in New York,\" he\ntold me. \"His word is good. This kidnapping charge is a phony. Just\na move to tie you up. What they think they have on you is a charge\nunder the Espionage Act, communicating with the enemy. Joe was vague\nbut it sounded plenty tough. The S.E.C.'s passed out word to be cagey\nin trading with you. They can't black-list you or freeze your funds\nwithout a hearing, but they sure can put on the heat. How much did\nWillamer want you to put into his racket?\"\n\n\"Half a million,\" I told him. \"One hundred thousand now and the rest in\nthirty days.\"\n\nMerry Vail drew a wry face, sucked in his lips and signaled to Tammy\nfor another drink. \"As a member of the Bar and an officer of the\ncourt,\" he remarked, \"I can't advise you to pay blackmail. On the other\nhand, if you could see your way to making a substantial investment in\nthe Inter-Alia Corporation, it might make things much pleasanter all\naround.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No, Merry,\" I told him, \"and you are through as my\nattorney. I'll take my chances without a lawyer from now on, if that's\nthe sort of advice I pay you for. I don't mind a gamble but these boys\nfigure to use malaria to put a financial squeeze on the whole world.\nEver see a man die of malignant malaria, Merry? It's not nice and it's\nnot necessary, if you have atabrine or quinine. No, damn it, you go\npeddle your papers and I'll fight this out alone. Tammy,\" I added. \"Get\nme the office, please. I want to talk to Mr. Cone again.\"\n\nVail grinned and clapped me on the shoulder. \"Like hell you'll do\nwithout an attorney, you damn fool!\" he said. \"I'm sticking with you,\nwith or without a fee. Say,\" he added, \"what's come into you to make\nyou act this way? You used to get the heebie-jeebies at the mere\nthought of legal complications.\"\n\n\"Phil,\" I said into the phone. \"This is Winnie. Things are plenty bad\nfor me personally. You and Graham can pull right out now if you wish.\nThat louse Harry Willamer or somebody has put me on the spot and I'm\ntrying to prove I'm not a Nazi agent.... No, neither are you, but you\nmight have a hell of a time proving it. That's swell of you, Phil, but\nI don't want to get you or Graham in trouble. Now's the time to pull\nout of the firm if you like. Naturally I'm innocent but just now it's\ntough. Okay, you take it up with Graham, will you? I don't want to have\nto worry about either of you.... Sure I'm in a jam but it's not your\nfault and has nothing to do with the firm....\"\n\nWhen I put the telephone back in its cradle I looked up to see Merry\nVail staring at me.\n\n\"Winnie,\" he said, \"you're innocent for my money. Fun's fun but this\nthing is dangerous. Now I'm your attorney and you'll sure as hell need\none so it's no use firing me. I don't know what sort of a frame they've\nfigured for you or why the F.B.I.--\"\n\nI laughed. \"Okay, Merry,\" I told him, \"you're still my attorney. The\nF.B.I.'s been swell. The Special Agent assigned to check up on me, A.\nJ. Harcourt, couldn't be nicer. I'd trust him not to pull a fast one.\"\n\nVail frowned. \"The F.B.I. may be swell,\" he answered, \"but their hand\ncan be forced. They have to act on information received and superior\norders. Your man Harcourt may be the nicest guy in the world but if\nhe's told to bring you in he'll bring you in.\"\n\n\"Then what's your advice, counselor?\"\n\n\"My advice to you, Winnie,\" he said, \"is to try to forget about it.\nJust go right ahead with your plans, whatever they are, just so you\ndon't try to leave this jurisdiction or go into hiding. The best thing\nyou could do is to go back to Bedford Hills and mind your own business\nand don't let these government so-and-so's push you around. Hell, this\nis a free country!\"\n\n\"But I phoned Jimmie to meet me at the Ritz at five o'clock,\" I\nobjected, \"with our traveling things.\"\n\nVail glanced at his wrist-watch. \"It's not three yet. If you phone her\nnow the chances are she hasn't left. Tell her to stay put. Remember,\nthe less you act guilty or scared the safer you are. The dog doesn't\nstart to chase the rabbit until the rabbit starts to run.\"\n\nI phoned back to Pook's Hill and was rewarded by catching Jimmie five\nminutes before the taxi was due to pick her up.\n\n\"Hold everything, dear,\" I told her. \"Plans have changed. I'm coming\nout on the first train I can catch. How's Ponto?\"\n\n\"Thank Heaven you called,\" Winnie's wife replied. \"I couldn't find your\ndressing gown and your traveling case is in the room with Ponto and I\ndidn't want to disturb him.... Oh he's snoring like mad. Passed out\ncold, I guess. He shakes the house. I never knew dogs got drunk, did\nyou?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I first arrived at Pook's Hill I had a definite program in mind.\nFirst, I went to the kitchen, broke a raw egg into a tumbler and soused\nit in Worchester sauce. Then I added a good slug of brandy from the\nportable bar in my den. Armed with this Prairie Oyster, I went boldly\nto the second floor, opened the door to my bedroom and contemplated the\ndebauched Great Dane.\n\nReally, I could never have believed that a dog could look so completely\nblotto. Ponto was a bum in every sense of the word. He lay drooling and\nsnoring on the bed, dead to the world.\n\n\"Ponto!\" I ordered.\n\nAn ear pricked up, then dropped languidly back again. Then a blood-shot\neye opened and shut. There was a half-whine, half snarl, interrupted by\na violent hiccough.\n\n\"Here you are, Ponto!\" I stated firmly, advancing on the bed, glass in\nhand.\n\nThe blood-shot eye opened again and the beast began to shake and\nshiver. I walked up, lifted his jowl in one hand, made a little funnel\nof his lip and poured in the Prairie Oyster. Then I clamped a firm\ncontrol on the jaws, held Ponto's head back and let it slide gulping\ndown his gullet.\n\nPonto heaved. He shuddered. He shook himself free, leaped from the\nbed and ran around the room, lurching, whining and shaking his head\nviolently. He stopped and sideswiped his muzzle with a clumsy paw. He\nlay down on his back and rolled.\n\nThen the dose took hold. A noble expression seemed to pour over his\nbrow. His eyes opened wide and remained open, with a clear and friendly\ngleam. He stood up, shook himself, ran into the bathroom, gulped some\nwater from his bowl very noisily, and then came bounding back.\n\n\"Wuff!\" He said to me.\n\nThen Ponto reared on his hind legs, placed two large paws on my\nshoulders and proceeded to lick my face thoroughly with a rough, wet\ntongue. I had made a friend, I decided. As Androcles had won the\nlion by removing the thorn from its paw, so had I tamed Ponto by\nadministering first-aid.\n\nThere was a tap at the door. It was Jimmie. \"Are you all right,\nWinnie?\" she asked. \"Is he still asleep?\"\n\n\"Asleep!\" I was contemptuous. \"No, he's awake. Ponto and I are pals.\nWe understand each other. He had a hang-over and I fixed him. We're\nbuddies now, aren't we, old fellow?\"\n\nThe answer was a low savage growl and I leaped through the door barely\nin time to escape his earnest but rather shaky attempt to remove a\ncouple of pounds of meat from my exterior.\n\n\"Hell!\" I explained, \"that beast's not human. Let's send him back to\nthe vet's and get something easier to live with--a Yorkshire or a\npoodle.\"\n\n\"I'd like a Chihuahua,\" said Germaine, \"or one of those little Belgian\nSchipperke gadgets.\"\n\n\"How about a collie?\" I asked.\n\nGermaine raised piteous eyes to me. \"Do you want to make me ill, with\nyour talk of collies?\" she asked. \"Now come on down to the den and tell\nme what's been going on in town.\"\n\n\"Well, Jimmie,\" I began, \"it's a long, long story--\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\n\"If it's going to be long,\" she said, \"we'd both better have a drink.\nYou always think better if you have a glass in your hand.\"\n\n\"Now, what is it you want to know?\" I answered, after we were\ncomfortably settled in front of the electric fire.\n\n\"It's--it's just that everything is so queer,\" Germaine began. \"You've\nchanged so that you almost seem like a different person. You even look\nbetter, not so flabby, as though you took regular exercise. At least\nI see a change, and then suddenly I find that you've been carrying on\nwith that Briggs girl and I can't tell whether you've really changed or\nare just trying to fool me. She's a nice person, of course, and if you\n_must_ have another girl, I'd rather have you pick someone--oh--safe\nand comfortable like her. But you said you hadn't been playing with\nthe office girls. And then there's Ponto. He used to adore you and you\nswore by him. Now he tries to bite you and you want to get rid of him.\nAnd then there's all this talk about where you were during Holy Week\nand that F.B.I. man and Myrtle tells me they've been asking a lot of\nquestions about you and Virginia. What _have_ you been doing, dear,\nthat you can't remember when our whole life may depend on it?\"\n\n\"Jimmie,\" I told her. \"I wish to God I knew. You must believe me when\nI tell you I can't remember things before Easter Monday. That was the\nsecond and today is the eleventh and I can remember everything that's\nhappened since then. Before that it is all blank and all mixed-up in\nthat dream I had.\"\n\nShe moved away from me, slightly. \"You can't tell me that the F.B.I.\nwould be interested in your dreams,\" she said sharply. \"Not in time of\nwar.\"\n\n\"They are in this dream,\" I told her. \"You see I dreamed--if you want\nto call it that--that a certain American ship blew up in the North\nPacific. The trouble is that the public hasn't been told that there is\nsuch a ship, like that 'Old Nameless' in the Solomons, and that the\nNavy Department doesn't know what happened to it. _I_ believe that\nit did blow up. Harcourt believes my story, in the main, but from\nthe F.B.I. angle they have to check up on whether I'm not part of an\nAxis spy-ring which could have caused the explosion. If I could only\nremember where I was and what I was doing the week before I could clear\nmyself.\"\n\nHer face lighted and she relaxed. \"Oh, is _that_ all?\" she exclaimed.\n\"I _know_ you couldn't have done anything like that. All you've\nprobably been doing is to go off with one of those silly girls of yours\nto some out-of-the-way place. That ought to be easy to check, even if\nyou registered under a false name. For the first time, you know,\" she\nadded, \"I'm almost _glad_ you've been chasing all those stupid blondes\nof yours. It will make it easy to establish your alias.\"\n\n\"Alibi,\" I corrected her. \"Let me fix you another drink. From now on,\"\nI added, \"there are going to be no more blondes or red-heads. I like\nArthurjean Briggs--she's named Arthurjean for her father and mother.\nIt's one word like Marylou or Honeychile--but she's more like a friend\nthan a--oh--you know. You saw her. But I guess you're right. I must\nhave been chasing around so much my mind got tangled up in itself and\nsort of blew a fuse. If I can't get my memory straightened out soon\nI'll look up a psychiatrist and see if he can't fix me.\"\n\n\"You know, Winnie--\" Germaine began and then fell silent.\n\n\"Yes, Jimmie?\"\n\nShe turned towards me and smiled rather wistfully. \"You know, I was\ngoing to say that you and I--perhaps--Well, it's so long since we've\nbeen really--oh--_close_ to each other. I wondered--\"\n\n\"You mean that perhaps we ought to patch things up between us?\"\n\n\"Isn't that what a wife's for?\" she asked. \"I mean--I mean when things\nget difficult it ought--there ought to be _one_ person to whom you\ncould turn.\"\n\nI slipped my arm around her and drew her close to me on the lounge. She\nlowered her face against my coat and I could feel her shaking.\n\n\"You're crying!\" I said. \"You mustn't cry.\"\n\n\"Oh, Winnie, I've been so alone--so--\"\n\nI raised her face to mine and kissed her, tasting the wet, salt tears.\nHer lips were warm and soft against mine. Suddenly she pressed herself\nagainst me and responded to my kiss so fiercely that we were both\nstartled. We sprang apart, almost guiltily.\n\n\"Oh!\" she exclaimed. \"Oh--you haven't kissed me like that--\"\n\nShe raised her lips again and this time we held it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat with one thing and another, I didn't get back to the office until\nthe Market closed on Thursday afternoon. I found my two partners in\npretty good control of our operations but frankly mystified as to the\ncause of the official mugging of Tompkins, Wasson & Cone. We had laid\nout two and a half millions in all, despite the attempt to scare us\noff. The market had continued steady.\n\nNeither Graham nor Phil asked me any direct questions about the events\non Wednesday. They talked straight business and kept their curiosity\nin check. It was close to half-past four when we finished our general\ndiscussion of the operation, so I decided that they were entitled to\nsome kind of explanation in return for their loyalty.\n\n\"See here, boys,\" I told them. \"You've both been perfectly swell about\nthis rat-race the S.E.C. started. Harry Willamer tried to put the\nsqueeze on me for half a million dollars to finance him and a bunch of\nofficial bastards in a shady deal. When I turned him down he threatened\nto tie us up with a Commission investigation. I bluffed him out of it\nat the time by pretending there was an F.B.I. dictaphone record of\nour talk, so he laid off the heavy heat and just started needling us\na little. Any time now he'll make the check at the F.B.I. and when\nhe finds there isn't any record he'll try to tie us up tighter than\na drum. All we can do is wait it out. The market's going to start\ndropping any day now and we'll clean up.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Wasson said. \"Was that it? Willamer's a bad actor. Thanks for\ntelling us, Winnie. Phil and I knew that there must be something screwy\nwhen--\"\n\nThe door flew open and Arthurjean appeared, her face white.\n\n\"God!\" she said at last. \"He was such a swell guy. He--\"\n\n\"Who? What's the mat--\"\n\n\"It's Roosevelt!\" she choked. \"He's dead. It just came in on the\nticker.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"He died at Warm Springs.\" And she hid her face in her hands and left\nthe room, sobbing.\n\nPhil Cone stood up, paper-white, crossed over and turned up the radio.\n\n\"Flash!\" the announcer was saying. \"Warm Springs, Georgia. President\nRoosevelt died this afternoon following his collapse from a severe\ncerebral hemorrhage. More in a moment. Keep tuned to this station.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be eternally damned!\" I said. \"So he was right--\"\n\nCone whirled on me. \"You knew about this,\" he stated flatly \"When we\nwere talking yesterday morning. You had more than a hunch. You knew he\nwas going to die.\"\n\n\"Be your age, Phil,\" I told him. \"How in hell _could_ I know?\"\n\n\"Je-sus Ke-rist!\" Wasson growled. \"This will knock holy hell out of the\nMarket. Lucky trading's closed for the day. They can't open tomorrow.\nThey'll have to shut down all the exchanges. They'll have to close the\nbanks. God! What a mess!\"\n\nCone still looked dazed. \"No dancing in the streets?\" he asked\nbitterly. \"I thought this was going to send values sky-rocketing.\"\n\nWasson swung on him. \"The hell with that talk, Phil,\" he snapped. \"I\nwas just shooting the bull. Roosevelt dead! Jesus H. Christ! You know,\nhe wasn't a bad old buzzard after he got rid of all that New Deal\nnonsense and set to work winning this war.\"\n\nCone had recovered his poise. \"Sure he did a swell job winning the war,\nbut now we're going to lose the peace, sure as shooting!\"\n\n\"Hell!\" Graham's choice of expletives was strictly rationed. \"This\nmeans that Truman will take over. What sort of a guy is he? You got any\nidea, Winnie? He's not up to Roosevelt, that's sure.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"I don't know from nothing,\" I began. \"Sh!\"\n\nThe radio announcer resumed his broadcast. \"Warm Springs, Georgia.\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt passed away at four thirty-five\nthis afternoon, Eastern War Time, following a severe cerebral\nhemorrhage. The late President had been spending a few days at his\nGeorgia retreat getting rested after his strenuous trip to the Yalta\nConference. Earlier this afternoon he complained of a severe headache\nand almost immediately became unconscious. He died peacefully a little\nlater. His death came at a moment when American troops in Germany and\non Okinawa were driving ahead toward the victory he--\"\n\nCone switched it down again. \"_He_ had a headache!\" he muttered. \"What\ndo you think _we're_ going to have?\"\n\nThe telephone rang. I picked up the instrument. It was one of those\nautomatic phonograph recordings. \"The Stock Exchange will not be open\ntomorrow by order of the Governors, out of respect for the memory of\nthe late President Roosevelt. That is all--The Stock Exchange will not\nbe open--\" the metallic feminine voice went on. I hung up.\n\n\"You're right about one thing, Graham,\" I said. \"That was an automatic\nmessage to say the Exchange will be closed tomorrow. It's probably on\nthe ticker, too.\"\n\nIt was.\n\nCone sat down suddenly, as though his legs had turned to rubber.\n\n\"Now it will all start again,\" he said. \"Sell out and pack up, pack up\nand clear out.\"\n\nI crossed the office and put my hand on his shoulder. \"Cheer up, Phil,\"\nI told him. \"It won't be as bad as that. Graham and I will stick with\nyou and that's true of Americans generally.\"\n\nCone shrugged his shoulders hopelessly. \"Thanks, Winnie,\" he remarked.\n\"You're a good fellow and a good friend. I've got something to say\nto you. You won't like it. I got worried yesterday when you started\ntalking about Roosevelt maybe dying and I tipped the F.B.I. on what you\nsaid.\"\n\nI laughed. \"If the F.B.I. arrested every man in Wall Street who had\never talked about Roosevelt dying the jails wouldn't hold them. Don't\nworry, Phil. In your shoes I'd have done the same thing.\"\n\nThe phone rang again. It was the receptionist. \"Mr. Harcourt is here to\nsee you, Mr. Tompkins,\" she informed me. \"Shall I ask him to wait?\"\n\n\"Tell him I'll see him in a couple of minutes,\" I replied.\n\n\"This is it, boys,\" I told my partners. \"It's the F.B.I. Now, the\nMarket's going to drop. It will be a bear market in a big way,\ndignified as hell, and we're in ahead of the others. You two just carry\non. Try to get a line on this guy Truman. Some of our Kansas City\ncorrespondents may have the dope. Phil, no hard feelings about this\nF.B.I. angle. They've been riding me for days on some crazy story Ranty\nTolan started about me last week.\"\n\nWasson looked at me coldly. \"If I thought that you had anything to do\nwith this--\" he began.\n\n\"Oh skip it!\" I begged him. \"You know me better.\"\n\nI picked up the phone and told the receptionist to send Harcourt in.\n\n\"Mr. Tompkins,\" he said. \"I've been ordered to ask you to come up to\nthe Bureau's headquarters right away.\"\n\n\"Am I under arrest?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well,\" Harcourt admitted, \"I haven't got a warrant but I think maybe\nyou better come with me.\"\n\n\"What's the charge?\"\n\n\"My chief will tell you what it's all about,\" he said. \"My orders were\nto bring you in for questioning.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I agreed. \"I'll come along quietly. Phil, will you tell Miss\nBriggs to ring up my wife and say I won't be home tonight and not to\nworry. I'll be all right.\"\n\nHarcourt came and laid his hand on my arm. \"Come along then,\" he\nordered gruffly.\n\n\"How about my lawyer?\" I inquired. \"Graham, will you phone Merry Vail\nand tell him I've been taken up to the F.B.I. for questioning?\"\n\nHarcourt looked up at me. \"Is Merriwether Vail your lawyer?\" he asked.\n\"I wouldn't bother to call him. We've picked him up too. All your\nassociates, outside of business and--er--pleasure, are being rounded\nup. The President's dead, Mr. Tompkins, and you're going to do some\ntalking to my chief.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\n\nThe events which brought me into the office of Edward Lamb, Deputy\nDirector of the F.B.I., on Friday the thirteenth, had developed so\nrapidly that I could scarcely believe that less than twenty-four hours\nhad passed since Harcourt had taken me into custody.\n\nWe had gone to the Federal Court House in a taxicab (paid for by me)\nwhere I was placed alone in a room for fifteen minutes. At the end of\nthat period I was informed that Washington had asked that I be sent\ndown for direct interrogation at the Bureau. I was told that if I\npreferred I could demand a formal warrant of arrest but that Mr. Vail,\nwho had been released with an apology, advised me to go, and that I\ncould confirm it by telephone--which I did. I was told that there was\nstill no formal charge against me but they asked if I would let myself\nbe fingerprinted. To this I agreed and then sat back while arrangements\nwere completed to fly me down to Washington from the LaGuardia Airport.\nHarcourt was to accompany me. That had been all. They allowed me to\nphone Germaine and tell her I was going to Washington and invite her to\njoin me there as soon as I could get hotel accommodations. The F.B.I.\nput me up for the night in one of their Manhattan hide-outs--an old\nhouse on East 80th Street--and in the morning Harcourt and I had taken\nthe plane. The clock had barely touched noon when I was told that Mr.\nLamb was ready to see me.\n\nLamb was a pleasant, youngish man--with that inevitable faint Hoover\nchubbiness--whose roomy office with its deep leather easy chairs\nspelled power in the F.B.I. I was amused to note that he followed Rule\n1 of whistle-stop detection, by seating me in a deep chair, facing the\nlight, while he sat at his desk on a definitely higher level and with\nthe light behind him.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Tompkins,\" he began, \"we've had disturbing reports about you\nfrom at least three different sources. Frankly, we still don't know\nwhat to make of them and the Director thought it would be better if you\ncame here and talked to us.\"\n\n\"Always glad to help,\" I assured him. \"If you'll tell me what the\nreports are, I'll try to explain.\"\n\nLamb glanced at a file of papers on his desk. \"The first one is an\nallegation that you aren't Winfred S. Tompkins, but an imposter who has\nkidnapped Tompkins and taken his place. That report was anonymous and\nwe don't attach any particular importance to it, although if necessary\nwe could use it to detain you for questioning under the Lindbergh Law.\"\n\nI stretched out my hands toward him. \"My fingerprints were taken last\nnight,\" I said. \"They ought to settle that question.\"\n\nLamb laughed. \"Unfortunately,\" he admitted, \"it takes a little time to\nestablish identity by fingerprints. The first tentative identification\nsuggested by yours was a man named Jonas Lee. He is a Negro currently\nemployed in the Charleston Navy Yard. However, I think we can assume\nthat the final identification will bear you out. They're working on it\nnow.\"\n\nThere was a buzz and he picked up the desk-telephone. \"Oh, they do,\" he\nremarked. \"Good!\"\n\nHe turned back to me. \"That was the Finger-Print Division. They're your\nprints, all right, so we'll cancel the kidnapping charge.\"\n\n\"What's the second strike on me?\"\n\n\"That's a report phoned in by one of your partners that you seemed\nto expect President Roosevelt's death two or three days before it\nhappened.\"\n\n\"I did,\" I explained. \"A man named Axel Roscommon came to my office,\nsaid that he was the chief Nazi agent in the United States, and told\nme that Roosevelt had been poisoned at Yalta. I had already reported\nRoscommon to the Bureau and was told to let him alone. Roscommon said\nthat only a few people, including Roosevelt, knew about the poisoning.\nI wanted to pass on the warning but was told that it was too late, that\nI would simply expose myself to suspicion. So what I did was to make\nnormal business preparations to take advantage of its effect on the\nStock Market.\"\n\nLamb looked up at the ceiling and remained silent for a few minutes.\n\"So that's the way it was,\" he said. \"For your personal information,\nMr. Tompkins, Roscommon told the Director the same thing a month ago\nbut when Mr. Hoover tried to warn the Secret Service he had his ears\nslapped back. If I'd known about the Roscommon angle in your case I\nwould have told the New York office not to worry. I thought perhaps\nthat this was another angle on the same story.\"\n\n\"Do you believe that President Roosevelt was assassinated, Mr. Lamb?\" I\nasked, point-blank.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"No, I do not,\" he replied. \"Not officially,\nthat is. It is not inconceivable and the Secret Service is so set in\nits ideas and methods that--well, frankly I'd rather not believe it.\nI have no evidence, aside from a verbal warning which might have been\ncoincidence. Some of our toxicologists say that it could be done,\nothers deny that there is a virus which can produce the symptoms of a\nparalytic stroke. In any case, it's outside of our jurisdiction.\"\n\nI heaved a sigh of relief. \"Thank God I'm clear of that one,\" I said.\n\"I shouldn't like to be mixed up, even by accident, in anything like\nthat. I remember what happened to Dr. Mudd.\"\n\nLamb nodded. \"The doctor who bandaged Booth's leg after the murder of\nLincoln? Yes, I can see your point.\"\n\n\"How about the third charge?\" I asked.\n\nLamb looked serious. \"That's not going to be so easy, Mr. Tompkins,\" he\nannounced. \"Harcourt reports that he doesn't think there's anything to\nit, but Naval Intelligence has the jitters about this Alaska business.\nIt seems to be pretty well established that on the afternoon of April\nsecond you stated that the U.S.S. Alaska had been sunk in an explosion\noff the western Aleutians. That was over ten days ago and there is\nstill no word from the carrier. The last report came from Adak which\nhad picked the ship up by radar on the first. The report given us was\nthat you represented that it was all a dream. What worries the Navy\nabout this explanation is that no public announcement had ever been\nmade of the Alaska's launching or commission. She's a sneak-carrier\nbuilt under stringent security regulations and until you came into the\npicture the Navy was pretty sure that there'd been no leak.\"\n\nI nodded dismally. \"Knowing the Navy,\" I replied, \"I can see how they\nfeel. All that I can suggest, Mr. Lamb, is that this is a case of\nmental telepathy. There have been plenty of other instances of it on\nrecord. Often they call it intuition or second sight. I can only say\nthat if you investigate and can find any other explanation I'll be\ndelighted.\"\n\n\"I don't think that Admiral Ballister--he's the present head of O.N.I.,\nthough they change so fast we almost lose count--will be satisfied\nwith the theory that it is a case of E.S.P. That's 'extra-sensory\nperception' and there have been plenty of scientific experiments in\nthat field but the Navy doesn't know about them. And then, of course,\nthere was the bomb--\"\n\nI nodded. \"The thorium bomb--\" I began, and stopped as I noticed an\nofficial change in Lamb's attitude.\n\n\"Exactly, Mr. Tompkins,\" he observed. \"The thorium bomb. Nobody--at\nleast outside of the President, the Secretary of the Navy and Professor\nChalmis--was supposed to know that there was such a thing as a thorium\nbomb. The security arrangements on the thorium project were so\ndrastic--\"\n\n\"Roscommon knew all about it,\" I said. \"He also mentioned Chalmis to\nme.\"\n\nThe Deputy Director looked slightly ill. \"He did, did he?\" he growled.\n\"_That_ will teach the Navy not to let the Bureau handle domestic\nsecurity. Hell, this thing gets bigger and bigger every minute. If\nRoscommon knew about it, then anybody could have known. Why, it's been\nan offense against the Espionage Act, even to print the word 'thorium'\noutside of chemical textbooks, and Chalmis is supposed to be in the\nT.B. sanitarium at Saranac. Wonder what happened to him?\"\n\nI leaned forward. \"He's dead, Mr. Lamb,\" I assured him. \"Everybody on\nthe Alaska is dead. The bomb went off and there's nobody left to tell\nthe tale.\"\n\n\"How do you do it, Tompkins?\" Lamb demanded. \"If you will give us the\ndetails and the names of your accomplices I think I can promise you a\nlife sentence instead of the electric chair.\"\n\n\"Mr. Lamb,\" I replied, \"You can promise till the cows come home. I--W.\nS. Tompkins--had no connection with it at all and you can't prove that\nI had. I know about it only because of--well, call it mental telepathy.\nI could sit down and tell you exactly what happened on the Alaska\nbefore Chalmis deliberately touched off the bomb, but I couldn't prove\nit and there isn't a living soul who could support or disprove my\nstory. And if you place me under arrest I'll be in a position to sue\nfor heavy damages. False arrest on a charge of treason is no joke and\nI'll fight.\"\n\nLamb looked slightly uncomfortable. \"Well?\" he asked. \"What would you\ndo if you were me? Let you go, with the Navy howling for action?\"\n\n\"There are two things I'd do,\" I told him. \"First of all, I'd assign\na flock of agents to see if they can find out where I was and what I\nwas doing between the 25th of March and the second of April. Harcourt\ntells me that was the critical period. I don't remember. It's a case\nof amnesia, I guess. At any rate, I've drawn a blank. You have my\nfingerprints and photograph. You ought to be able to locate something.\"\n\nLamb shook his head. \"That's not necessary now,\" he replied. \"If\nRoscommon knew about Chalmis and the bomb, the question of where you\nwere the week before last isn't important any more. We'd have to check\nback for at least two years.\"\n\n\"The other thing I'd do,\" I continued, \"would be to let me go under\nsome sort of open arrest. Fix me up so I can see the intelligence\npeople here and give me a chance to convince them that--\" I paused.\n\n\"Convince them of what?\" he asked tartly.\n\n\"See here, Mr. Lamb,\" I said. \"I'm in a hell of a personal jam. For\npersonal reasons I'm trying to clear things up. Believe it or not, this\nbusiness about the sinking of the Alaska and the thorium bomb is the\nleast of my troubles. I've got the damndest case of loss of memory I've\never heard of. As Winfred S. Tompkins I can only remember as far back\nas April second, but I can remember years before that as somebody else.\nThat's how I happen to know about the loss of the Alaska.\"\n\n\"How?\" he asked. \"According to your theory, everybody aboard her is\ndead.\"\n\nI nodded. \"Just the same, I was on the ship when she blew up--in my\ndream, I mean. If you give me a chance to talk to the intelligence\nheads, I think I can prove to their satisfaction not only that I know\nwhat I'm talking about but that my knowledge is perfectly legitimate.\"\n\nLamb grinned. \"The Bureau is in enough fights as it is without being\naccused of sending a screw-ball around to bother the heads of G-2 and\nO.N.I.\"\n\nI leaned forward. \"I can see your point,\" I admitted. \"I know that in\nthe Navy everybody is out to cut everybody else's throat. It must be\nworse when two different Government Bureaus are involved.\"\n\nThe Deputy Director looked at me. \"You seem to know a hell of a lot\nabout the Navy for a stock-broker,\" he observed. \"At any rate, that\nidea's out. I won't give you introductions and--\"\n\n\"Okay!\" I agreed. \"Then let me try to do it my own way. I have some\nfriends in the O.S.S. I'll see if they can't get me in to see General\nDonovan. If I have a talk with him, perhaps he'll agree to pass me on\nto the others.\"\n\nLamb laughed again. \"You don't know Washington, Mr. Tompkins. General\nDonovan's blessing won't help you,\" he declared. \"They hate his guts\nfor trying to make them combine. However, if you think you can get to\nsee him on your own, go right ahead but for God's sake don't say the\nBureau sent you over.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I agreed. \"Then I take it I'm under open arrest. I won't\ntry to leave town without telling you. Any suggestions of where I can\nfind a hotel room for the next few days?\"\n\nLamb leaned back in his chair and grinned boyishly. \"The Bureau has\na lot of authority,\" he declared, \"but it's not God. There won't be\na hotel room to be had for love or money for the next two weeks.\nRoosevelt's death is bringing everybody back to Washington. President\nTruman is taking over and most officials are too busy to be bothered.\nUsually, it's not hard to get a hotel room over the week-end but not\nthis time. If you can't get accommodations, phone back here and we'll\nfix you up with a cot somewhere in the F.B.I. barracks.\"\n\n\"Then I'm in the clear, so far as you are concerned,\" I suggested.\n\nLamb smiled cryptically. \"I didn't say that,\" he remarked, \"and it\nisn't so. We have nothing specific to hold you on, but the Alaska is\nmissing and, if you insist, the President is dead, and you're caught in\nthe middle.\"\n\n\"What will it take to get myself cleared?\" I asked.\n\nLamb considered. \"If you can get O.N.I, off our necks, with a clean\nbill of health, we'll relax,\" he admitted. \"But I give you twenty-four\nhours to do it. Admiral Ballister's pretty worked up on this Alaska\nbusiness, and he wants action.\"\n\nI nodded. \"Okay, I'll give it to him,\" I said.\n\n\"Okay, Tompkins,\" he remarked. \"It's your funeral. But remember, if\nyou're not cleared in twenty-four hours, we'll be calling you in again\nand this time we'll give you the works.\"\n\nLuck was with me. I left the F.B.I. and walked up Pennsylvania Avenue\nto the Willard. As I followed the queue to the registration clerk at\nthe desk I heard the man just ahead of me start to say: \"I want to\ncancel--\"\n\n\"Just a moment, sir,\" the clerk said, as he picked up the telephone.\n\"Yes, madam? No, I'm sorry--\"\n\nI plucked at the man's sleeve.\n\n\"Don't cancel, if it's for tonight,\" I said, \"Here's a hundred,\" and I\nheld out two fifty dollar bills.\n\nThe man nodded. \"Okay, buddy,\" he agreed, pocketing the money. \"The\nname's R. L. Grant of Detroit.\"\n\n\"Name, please,\" the clerk asked.\n\n\"R. L. Grant of Detroit,\" I answered. \"I have a reservation.\"\n\n\"Right,\" he said. \"Lucky for you you wired a week ago. Here you are,\nMr. Grant. Please register.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\nAfter lunch--which was poor, slow and expensive--I screwed up my\ncourage and telephoned the Office of Strategic Services.\n\n\"May I speak to Mrs. Jacklin?\" I asked the switch-board girl. She\npromptly referred me to Information, who told me that Mrs. Dorothy\nJacklin was on Extension 3046, shall-I-connect you?\n\nA moment later a pleasant voice said, \"Yes? This is Mrs. Jacklin.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Jacklin,\" I told my wife, \"my name is Tompkins, W. S. Tompkins. I\nhave a message for you from Commander Jacklin.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. It was not a question. \"Are you a friend of Frank's? Is\nhe all right?\"\n\n\"He asked me to see you when I got to Washington and gave me some\nspecial messages for you. I'm staying at the Willard. Are you free for\ncocktails or dinner this evening?\"\n\nSomething of the urgency in my voice communicated itself to her and I\ncould feel her reverse her original impulse to refuse the invitation.\n\n\"Why yes, Mr. Tompkins,\" she agreed. \"I'd be glad to join you, for\ncocktails, that is. Shall we say about half past five?\"\n\n\"Splendid! I'll meet you in the south lobby. I'm sure to recognize\nyou, Frank gave me such a good description of you. If there's any\nslip-up, have one of the bellboys page me.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said. \"I'll be there.\"\n\nAs I laid down the telephone, my pulse was racing and my throat was\ndry. How in God's name should I act with her?\n\nHalf-past five crawled around. I filled in some of the time by phoning\nthe F.B.I. and telling Lamb's secretary I was registered at the Willard\nunder the name of R. L. Grant. I phoned Bedford Hills and told Jimmie\nthat I was in Washington and wanted her to join me at the Willard. She\nwas a little slow about getting the R. L. Grant angle but allowed that\nshe could register as Mrs. Grant or Mrs. John Doe if necessary and when\nwas all this nonsense going to stop?\n\nIn spite of my assurance, I almost failed to recognize Dorothy. She\nlooked younger, smarter and infinitely more self-possessed, and the\ntanned and muscular young man in uniform who accompanied her was\nobviously not animated by brotherly sentiments toward her.\n\n\"Mrs. Jacklin?\" I asked. \"I'm Tompkins. And--\" I turned eloquently to\nher escort.\n\n\"Oh, this is Major Demarest,\" she said. \"Thanks, Tony, for escorting\nme. I'll see you later?\"\n\n\"Half-past sixish?\" Demarest asked.\n\n\"Say seven,\" Dorothy told him. \"I'll meet you here, by the desk.\"\n\nSo I was neatly bracketed. While Dorothy and I were talking, her\nescort would be waiting--impatiently. There was no chance of a\nprolonged operation. I must keep things moving.\n\nI took her to the rather garish cocktail lounge on the east side of the\nhotel and ordered her a Bourbon old-fashioned and a Scotch-and-soda for\nmyself.\n\n\"Frank told me that's what you like,\" I remarked, before she could\nraise her eyebrows after I told the waiter to bring a sliver of lemon\npeel to go with the old-fashioned.\n\n\"Where did you know him?\" she asked.\n\nI leaned confidently across the table. \"Mrs. Jacklin,\" I told her, \"I'm\nin intelligence. Tompkins is my name but I don't use it much. I've\nseen quite a bit of your husband during the past few years--here at\nWashington and out in the Pacific. In fact,\" I added, \"I might say that\nI'm his closest friend. We were at school together, many years ago. I'm\nsurprised he never mentioned me.\"\n\n\"How _is_ he?\" she asked. \"I know too much to ask _where_ he is.\"\n\nI looked gravely at her. \"We don't know where he is,\" I replied. \"His\nship hasn't been reported for nearly two weeks. He was on a special\nmission. That's why I've looked you up. Frank made me promise that I\nwould if--I mean--he thought--\"\n\nDorothy drained her glass and gave me a long, strange look. \"Are you\ntrying to tell me that he's dead?\" she asked.\n\n\"It's not official,\" I said. \"It may never be confirmed, but I\npersonally am sure, as sure as I'm sitting here that you'll never see\nhim again.\"\n\nShe looked down at the table and nervously tapped an unlighted\ncigarette against her lacquered thumb-nail. \"I'll have another drink,\nif you don't mind,\" she said. \"It's not that--well, our marriage was\nover long ago--but, he--I--\"\n\nI signaled our waitress and duplicated our order.\n\n\"This is one of the times when my father told me to remember the\ngiants,\" she said.\n\nI raised my eyebrows.\n\n\"My father was professor of philosophy at Wesleyan,\" she explained.\n\"He always said that it was impossible to imagine anything so big that\nthere wasn't something else bigger. He said that it stood to reason\nthat somewhere in the universe there was a race of giants so big that\nit took them a million years to draw a breath. He said when things\nseemed difficult just to think about that.\"\n\n\"Sounds like the Navy Department,\" I observed. \"Was he the one who\nargued that there might be several sexes? Frank told me something--\"\n\nShe smiled. \"Yes. That was when I was adolescent and having crushes\nabout boys. He said that somewhere there must be a place where, Instead\nof two, there were six or seven sexes. He suggested that falling in\nlove under those conditions was really complicated. He was a nice man,\"\nshe added. \"He's dead.\"\n\n\"Your father sounds like a right guy,\" I remarked. \"Frank said--\"\n\n\"How do I know you're telling the truth?\" she suddenly interrupted.\n\"What proof have you?\"\n\nHere I was on home-ground. \"Frank thought of that. He told me to remind\nyou that you have a mole on your left hip, that you're nuts about\nProkofiev, that you don't think much of Ernest Hemingway as an author\nand--\"\n\n\"The louse!\" she exclaimed. \"Oh, I know I oughtn't to talk about him\nthis way if he's dead but I didn't dream men told each other--\"\n\nI pulled out my fountain pen and wrote my Jacklin signature rapidly\nacross the back of the drink-card. I pushed it at her across the table.\n\n\"There!\" I told her. \"Recognize that, Mrs. Jacklin?\"\n\n\"Why!\" Dorothy exclaimed. \"It's his writing! Who _are_ you, Mr.\nTompkins? Only I could say that it's a forgery.\"\n\n\"Listen, Dorothy,\" I began conspiratorially. \"And if I call you Dorothy\nit is only because your husband always spoke of you as Dorothy. I must\nsee General Donovan. This is much more than a matter of your husband\nand yourself. It's a matter of top-echelon intelligence.\"\n\nShe looked downcast. \"The General's out of town,\" she said. \"He's\ntrying to get back for the Roosevelt funeral but the man who's running\nthe show in his absence is Colonel McIntosh. Ivor McIntosh.\"\n\nThere was a curl to her lips as she pronounced the name that told\nme all I needed to know about the colonel. Still, beggars can't be\nchoosers and Colonel McIntosh was ever so much better than nothing at\nall.\n\n\"Very well,\" I told her. \"Will you arrange to have me see Colonel\nMcIntosh tomorrow morning? Tell--\" here I took a leap--\"Tell him that\nI'm from the White House.\"\n\n\"You aren't, are you?\"\n\n\"Of course not, but I gather that's the kind of bait your Colonel\nneeds.\"\n\n\"He's a very clever man,\" Dorothy belatedly defended him. \"They say\nhe did brilliant staff-intelligence work under Stillwell in the first\nBurma campaign.\"\n\n\"That's the one we lost, isn't it?\" I asked dryly. \"No, Dorothy. Let me\nsee this Colonel. You know how to fix it--there's always one special\ngirl in an office that has the ear of a man like that. Frank swore to\nme that there was nothing you couldn't do if you decided it was worth\nwhile.\"\n\nShe looked at me across the little round, black table. \"Mr. Tompkins,\"\nshe said, \"I have no way of telling whether you are telling the truth\nor not. Frankly, if General Donovan was in town I wouldn't bother him,\nbut Colonel McIntosh is--you know--one of _the_ Chicago McIntoshes.\nYou never heard of him? Nobody else did either but here he is with a\nBritish accent and if you can make the grade with him it won't worry\nme.\"\n\nI ordered another round of drinks.\n\n\"Tell me, Dorothy,\" I said, \"not that it's any of my business, except\nthat I was a friend of your husband's, don't you feel any special\nregret that he's probably gone west?\"\n\nShe took a man-sized swallow of her old-fashioned. \"Not particularly,\"\nshe admitted. \"In a general, normal sort of way, I'm sorry, of course.\nHe was nice even if we didn't get on very well. But we had almost no\ninterests in common and when we broke up it was for keeps. He was kind,\nand on the whole, decent, but God! so stuffy and boring to live with.\nDay after day, Hartford, Connecticut, writing and yessing, living by\nminutes and dying by inches. He rather liked it. I couldn't understand\nit. So you can see why I can't pretend to be prostrated. And perhaps he\nisn't dead at all.\"\n\nI nodded. \"He's dead if that's the way you feel about him,\" I said. \"He\ntold me that his wife was a lovely girl with a mole on her hip and the\nhell of a temper. He said it was like being married to a circus acrobat\nor an opera singer--exciting but not happy. He said you had a habit\nof--\" I stopped in the nick of time.\n\n\"Oh, he did, did he?\" she snapped. \"Well, Mr. Tompkins, I don't suppose\nhe ever told you that he snored or that--\"\n\n\"Skip it, please,\" I calmed her. \"It's your marriage, not mine. I told\nyou these things so you'd know I was really sent to you by Frank. Now\nyou fix it so I can talk to McIntosh.\"\n\n\"I will,\" she replied.\n\nIt was the epitaph on ten years of marriage. I knew when I was\nlicked. Dorothy was what she had been when I had picked her out of\nMiddletown--as inaccessible as the root of a Greek aorist or as a\nbook of curiosa in a Carnegie library. She had not shown a trace of\nrecognizing Frank Jacklin inside the body of Winnie Tompkins, even\nthough my morning calisthenics were reducing my circumference. I was\nlicked. I was no Faustus to woo this Marguerite, especially when she\nobviously had someone else on the string. The Master of the Rat Race\nobviously meant me to play the hand he had dealt me, and no Joker. By\nGodfrey, it would go hard with Dorothy's boss when I came to grips with\nhim. All the Navy men who had been hitched by Washington would applaud\nme--Marty Donnell who had been sent out against the \"Nagato\" with the\nwrong size shells for his guns; Abie Roseman, who had been cashiered\nbecause he had refused to okay a travel order for the Admiral's\nsweetie; Julius Winterbottom, who had died on the \"Lexington\"--and all\nthe gobs who had died. Well, win or lose, I'd give the F.B.I. a run for\nits money and what could they do to me? Damn it! I was a civilian--one\nof the guys that paid their salaries!\n\nColonel Ivor McIntosh of the Chicago McIntoshes was one of those who\nhad been born with a platinum spoon and a broad \"A\" in his mouth. His\nface bore the marks of years of application to the more expensive\ntables, cellars and bedrooms. His uniform was in the U.S. Army but\ndefinitely not of it--having a Savile Row touch that suggested the\nGuards. He was, he told me, in charge of the O.S.S. \"until Bill gets\nback,\" and what could he do for me?\n\n\"Colonel,\" I said. \"I came to you in the face of strong opposition from\nthe F.B.I. I have first-hand information concerning the sinking of the\nAlaska.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" McIntosh replied cheerily. \"It was on the map five minutes\nago. I'm sure it's still there.\"\n\nI smiled. \"The U.S.S. Alaska, sir,\" I explained. Colonels love to be\ncalled \"Sir,\" especially by a civilian. \"I have the inside story of\nthe sinking of the carrier. The F.B.I. told me it was useless to try\nto see you or Admiral Ballister. In fact, they ordered me under no\ncircumstances to mention the F.B.I. in connection with my mission.\"\n\nMcIntosh toyed with a crystal elephant on his desk. \"Exactly what _is_\nyour mission?\" he asked.\n\nI drew myself up, not without dignity. \"I am with Z-2, Colonel,\" I told\nhim, \"and as you know the Z Bureau reports only to the President.\" I\nhad heard of G-2, A-2, even X-2. Why not Z-2--to end all 2's.\n\n\"Of course,\" he agreed without bending an eyelash. \"But why have you\ncome to see me, Mr. Tompkins?\"\n\n\"Call me Grant, Colonel,\" I replied with a knowing smile. \"That's the\nname I'm registered under at the Willard. The reason I've come to you,\nis that my orders, which were given to me personally last February by\nPresident Roosevelt, were to consult the head of the O.S.S. if anything\nwent wrong. As you undoubtedly know, Roosevelt had a very warm feeling\nfor the O.S.S. and my instructions have been to work with your men\nwhenever possible. F.D.R. told me that, if I needed prompt action\nat any time to come to this office and skip the other intelligence\nservices.\"\n\nColonel McIntosh was only human, if from the Chicago McIntoshes. He\nrelaxed. He almost smiled.\n\n\"I got back to this country less than two weeks ago, Colonel,\" I told\nhim. \"I was working on the other end of the Alaska case--and it's a\ntough one--when word came of the President's death. My report was due\nto him at Warm Springs next Monday. Now I'll have to take it up direct\nwith Admiral Ballister. The F.B.I.'s trying to block me.\"\n\n\"Why?\" he asked, but he knew why.\n\nI shrugged my shoulders. \"You know Washington, Colonel,\" I said.\n\"The F.B.I. tried to get control of Z-2 and was stopped by the other\nservices. Since then, they've refused all cooperation. And I must get\nto see Admiral Ballister before he goes away for the week-end. Since\nRoosevelt's death the whole town has changed and Truman is too busy and\nbothered to see Z-2 reports.\"\n\nColonel McIntosh put in some earnest home-work on the telephone.\n\n\"Ballister,\" he said at last. \"McIntosh speaking, O.S.S. A Mr. R. L.\nGrant--that's not his name, but he's from Z-2--Yes, of course you\ndo. That's the special--Yes, that's right, Admiral. He has an urgent\nreport for you. He's been trying to reach you since Thursday but our\ngood friend J. Edgar has been blocking him--Sure, you remember--That\nwas a couple of years ago, when Edgar tried to grab Z-2 and we all\nhelped block it. Grant has some hot stuff for you, on the Alaska\nsinking--Fine! Yes, he'll be over as fast as my car can take him. Oh,\nnot at all. Always glad to help--As you know, orders are to help Z-2 at\nall times--no questions asked, nothing on paper--Righto!\"\n\nMcIntosh hung up and turned to me with an air of authority. \"That was\nAdmiral Ballister, Mr.--er--Grant,\" he said. \"He'll see you right away.\nI'll have my chauffeur drive you over to the Navy Department. You can\ntalk freely to the Admiral. He's a sound man.\"\n\nI smiled wanly. I had won the first round of my match with the F.B.I.\nBallister meant nothing to me but I had to convince him that I was on\nthe level or Mr. Lamb would close in on me. In any case, I owed it to\nmy Navy friends to take a fall out of the Department. After all, I\ncouldn't be worse off than I already was, with the G-Men breathing down\nmy neck and me out on open arrest, on a charge of treason. The electric\nchair doesn't look funny when there's even the faintest chance of your\nsitting in it yourself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\n\n\"Name please!\" asked the snippy young thing at the Navy Department\nReception Desk.\n\n\"R. L. Grant,\" I told her. \"To see Admiral Ballister. By appointment,\"\nI added.\n\n\"Have you any identification, Mr. Grant?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Of course not. Tell the Admiral that Z-2 has no identification. He\nwill understand.\"\n\nShe looked at me very dubiously but dialed a telephone and muttered\ninto it. Suddenly she cackled, \"You don't say? Sure! I'll send him\nright up.\"\n\nShe beamed at me. \"The Admiral is expecting you, sir,\" she said.\n\"Here's your badge. Will you please sign this form?\"\n\nShe thrust a blue-and-white celluloid saucer at me, with a number on\nit, and passed a mimeographed form, which I duly signed \"Robert E.\nLee, C.S.A.,\" and which she duly accepted and filed. A Marine sergeant\nappeared out of the shadows and led me up a flight of stairs and along\nseveral unevenly paved concrete floors to an office where a battery of\nWaves and Junior Lieutenants promptly took me in charge.\n\nAdmiral Ballister was a civilian's dream of a Navy Officer--\"every\nother inch a sailor,\" as we used to say in the Pacific--with a ruddy\nface tanned by ocean winds or rye whisky, grizzled hair, incipient\njowls, a \"gruff old sea-dog\" manner and a hearty hand-clasp.\n\n\"Glad to see you Grant,\" he told me. \"I've been checking up on Z-2\nsince McIntosh called. You boys have been doing one hell of a swell job\non your security. There's not a word about you in our files.\"\n\n\"Z-2, Admiral,\" I replied modestly, \"is forbidden by the terms of\nthe Executive Order setting us up to put itself on record. We have\nno identification, we get no glory, but a Z-2 agent was in the Jap\nsquadron that attacked Pearl Harbor and one of our men was military\nsecretary to Rommel in North Africa. At least two of our agents hold\nthe rank of General in the Red Army. As you know, sir, we report\ndirectly to the President, and always verbally. Nothing on paper.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" the Admiral agreed wistfully. \"McIntosh is usually\nall wet\"--he paused for me to register a flash of strictly subordinate\nglee at his meteorological witticism--\"but he gave me a fill-in on the\nfine job you did on the Alaska case.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I worried your O.N.I. group in New York, sir!\"--in\naddressing an Admiral, the \"sir!\" should not be slurred but should\ncome out with a touch of whip-crack, if you wish promotion in the U.S.\nNavy--\"They almost penetrated my cover as W. S. Tompkins, a Bedford\nHills stock-broker with offices in Wall Street, and reported me to the\nF.B.I.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Ballister seemed relieved. \"So _you_ are Tompkins. No wonder\nChurch Street was worried. Of course, they didn't know you were Z-2.\"\n\n\"Naturally I couldn't tell them, sir!\" I confided. \"I was due to\nreport to President Roosevelt at Warm Springs next Monday but since\nhis death, I have to report to you, according to previous White House\ninstructions. The new President hasn't had time to get orientated on\nZ-2 operations and this Alaska business can't wait, sir!\"\n\nBallister did some dialing, asked a few terse questions--gruff old\nsea-dog style--over the telephone and then turned to me.\n\n\"It's lucky for you, Grant, you didn't try to report to the White\nHouse. The Secret Service might have nabbed you,\" he said. \"The\nNaval Aide tells me that all Roosevelt's papers and records have been\nimpounded for the Roosevelt Estate under the law and that it may be\nweeks before they are untangled. Now, tell me about the Alaska. We've\nhad no report on her since early on the second, when she cleared Adak.\"\n\n\"Before I report to you, sir!\" I replied, \"I'd rather you ask me a\nfew questions about Alaska and Operation Octopus. In that way you can\nsatisfy yourself that I know what I'm talking about.\"\n\n\"Good!\" the Admiral grunted. \"Wish O.N.I. had as much sense as Z-2.\nSave a lot of time. When was Alaska commissioned?\"\n\n\"Late in February, sir! At Bremerton. Trial run in March to Pearl\nHarbor, back to San Diego for fueling and up the coast to Bremerton\nagain. Latest U.S. light carrier in the Pacific. A sneak-job. 38 knots\nat full speed, 8,000 mile cruising radius. Twenty-four planes--eight\nlight bombers, sixteen fighters. Anti-aircraft and radar out of this\nworld.\"\n\nBallister studied the map of the Pacific across the room from his desk.\n\"Who is her commander and what's his nickname?\"\n\n\"Captain Horatio McAllister, U.S.N., sir! Commonly known as Stinky\nMcAllister. No reason assigned for 'Stinky,' at least so far as reserve\nofficers knew.\"\n\n\"Stinky? That's because he once used perfumed soap before going to the\nMidshipmen's Ball in Washington,\" the Director of Naval Intelligence\ninformed me. \"It was his second year at Annapolis. Who was Stinky's\nexec?\"\n\n\"Commander B. S. Moody, sir!\" I answered. \"His nickname is suggested by\nhis initials--a roly-poly sort of guy and hipped on boat-drills and all\nthat.\"\n\nBallister glanced at a list on his desk. \"Her chaplain?\" he asked.\n\n\"Father Eamon Devalera O'Flaherty, begob and begorra, savin' your\nriverence,\" was my reply. \"A grand man and a good priest. God rest his\nsoul.\"\n\nBallister wriggled in his chair with some discomfort, as though he felt\nhe ought to stand at attention or order a volley fired over the ship's\nside.\n\n\"What about Commander Chalmis?\" he inquired, with an air of baiting an\nelephant-trap for me. \"What job did he do?\"\n\n\"Chalmis was not a commander, sir!\" I told him. \"He was a civilian. He\nhad some kind of a thorium bomb and the chief job he did was to use it\nto blow up the ship. The mission was to drop it on Paramushiro before\nthe Army could get going with its uranium bomb. Chalmis got cold feet,\nsir! when he thought of the carrier instead. He argued that the Navy\nDepartment would conclude that thorium was unreliable and drop the\natomic project until the end of the war.\"\n\nBallister leaned back in his chair and gave careful consideration to\nthe design of his Annapolis Class pin. After a long pause, he swung\naround in his swivel-chair and faced me squarely.\n\n\"Grant,\" he barked, \"I'm going to ask you an unofficial question. You\ndon't have to answer it. I have no authority over Z-2 anyway, but this\nis mighty important to the Navy.\"\n\n\"Go ahead, sir!\" I told the Admiral, \"if I can't answer it I'll tell\nyou why.\"\n\n\"Do you believe,\" the Chief of O.N.I. asked slowly, \"that Chalmis could\nhave been inspired by Another Government Agency to make a failure of--\"\nhe paused.\n\n\"Operation Octopus, sir?\"\n\n\"Right! Could Chalmis have deliberately destroyed Alaska and sacrificed\nhis life in the interest of General Groves and the Army's bomb?\"\n\nGroves was a new name to me but I took it in my stride. I looked the\nAdmiral full in the eye--a thing which Admirals rate along with a\nsnappy \"Sir!\" as proof of initiative, intelligence and subordination on\nthe part of their inferiors.\n\n\"I am not at liberty to answer that question, Admiral,\" I replied. \"My\norders forbid me to discredit any of the armed forces of the United\nStates. After all, sir!\" I added, \"we must not forget that Professor\nChalmis paid for his loyalty with his life.\"\n\nBallister's face lighted up with nautical glee. \"I knew it! I knew it!\"\nhe roared. \"By God! I knew there was something wrong the last time I\nconsulted G-2, they were so smug and polite. I might have known that\nthey were cooking up something to get even with the Navy for winning\nthis war in the Pacific. My God! Grant, you have to respect the Army\nfor their fanaticism, if for nothing else. Here is a civilian like\nChalmis, a great scientist, proved 100% reliable by all of our tests.\nWe checked him for twelve months before we even approached him on the\nthorium research. Yet the Army, the damned, stinking, two-timing,\ngold-bricking, double-crossing, medal-splashing, glory-grabbing,\ncredit-claiming Army, gets next to him on the sly and persuades him\nto blow himself up rather than let the Navy get ahead with its atomic\nbomb.\"\n\nI nodded admiringly at his flow of language. \"Admiral,\" I told him,\n\"when I came into this office I had a notion you were just another\nWashington desk-hero. No man who can express himself with such\neloquence can have shirked his sea-duty. Mind you, sir!\" I continued,\n\"I do _not_ state that the Army had a hand in this outrage. All I ask\nis that you give me clearance to the head of Army Intelligence, whoever\nhe is now. They keep shipping them into quote war-zones unquote, so\nthey can qualify for active service pay and allowances, campaign\nribbons and citations, to back up a special act of congress for their\npermanent promotion to the rank of Major-General.\"\n\n\"West Point--\" Ballister began and emerged panting five minutes later\nafter a personally conducted tour of the United States Military Academy.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Grant--\" Ballister was all but chanting as he\nconcluded--\"I'll send you over to see that prince of double-crossers,\nMajor-General Ray L. Wakely, director of Army Counter-Intelligence,\nso-called. Mind you, he probably won't admit you to the Pentagon,\ncoming from me, or if he does he'll try to frame you--\"\n\n\"Z-2, Admiral,\" I answered him, \"is entirely familiar with General\nWakely's methods and reputation. I can take care of myself, if you can\nget me into the Pentagon. I have some reports, entirely apart from the\nAlaska business, which belong to the Army and I should deliver them\nto Wakely in person. As you know, Z-2 is not allowed to take part in\ninterdepartmental feuds.\"\n\n\"That's all very well,\" Ballister barked at me, \"but right is right and\nwrong is wrong. You're not supposed to be blind to that, are you?\"\n\n\"You ought to know where our sympathies lie, sir!\" I snapped back. \"But\nmy orders are to see Wakely, if he's in charge of counter-intelligence.\"\n\nThis was sheer bravado. As a matter of fact, I knew I ought to call it\na day now that Ballister was in my camp but the best way to keep him on\nmy side was to move against his Army opponents. I felt rather like a\nslug in a slot-machine as it starts to hit the jack-pot. I would teach\nthe F.B.I. not to monkey with Winnie Tompkins. Z-2 had been a happy\nthought. So far nobody had gagged on it and with Roosevelt's papers\ntied up, the war would be over before any of the topside officials\nguessed I had invented it.\n\nBallister calmed down enough to buzz his secretary and tell her to get\nGeneral Wakely on the line, but fast. A moment later the gruff old\nsea-dog was talking to the double-crossing Army Counter-Intelligence\nDirector.\n\n\"Hullo, Ray? This is Ballister. How's your golf? Too bad! Neither can\nI.... Well, there's a civilian here you ought to see ... Grant, R. L.\nNot his real name, of course ... from Z-2.... Yes, Z as in zebra, two\nas in two.... He's just cleaned up one of our worst headaches and says\nhe has some special reports for you.... No idea, Ray, he didn't tell me\nand I didn't ask him.... Z-2 doesn't talk. No, not in the least like\nour Edgar or Wild Bill. Can you see him today?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Sorry sir!\" I interrupted the Admiral. \"I can't see\nhim until tomorrow morning at seven-thirty.\"\n\nThe Admiral winced as though a cobra had suddenly appeared on his\nblotter. Then he grinned maliciously. \"Hold on a minute, Ray,\" he\nsaid. \"You can have your golf this afternoon, after all. Grant says he\ncan't see you until tomorrow at seven-thirty.... Yes, seven-thirty....\nNo, ten o'clock will be too late, he says.... At your office at\nseven-thirty, then.\"\n\nHe hung up and turned back to me. \"You know, Grant,\" he remarked, \"I\nwouldn't mind belonging to Z-2 for a few days myself if I could make\nthat scoundrel Wakely rise at an ungodly hour on Sunday morning.\"\n\n\"His little Wac won't like it?\" I insinuated.\n\n\"Little Wac!\" Ballister exploded. \"She weighs a good hundred and sixty\npounds and stands five feet eight in her bedroom slippers. Naturally\nshe's working for the Navy. We have to establish _some_ liaison with\nG-2. Poor old Wakely will catch holy hell from her for this. Have you\nany other appointments I could help you with, Grant?\"\n\n\"No, sir! I did this to General Wakely because the last time one of our\nZ-2 agents had to report to G-2, General Strong--you remember that old\nhellion--kept our man waiting for two hours. That's as bad as though\nyou kept the President of the United States waiting.\"\n\nBallister appeared slightly worried. \"You know, Grant,\" he told\nme, \"I see your point. I sympathize with your attitude, but these\ninter-service feuds can lead to trouble. The thing to do is to be\npleasant and friendly as hell and not get him sore over trifles, but\nwait for a chance to stab him in the back. I think you would have\nbeen wiser not to annoy General Wakely. When G-2 is annoyed, there is\nabsolutely nothing of which they are not capable. They are the most\nunconscionable, unscrupulous, prevaricating, meretricious double-dyed\nsons of bachelors on the face of the globe. Hitler,\" the Admiral\ncontinued, \"fights a clean war compared to G-2. You may be in Z-2 and\nyou may represent the Commander-in-Chief, Grant, but Roosevelt is dead.\nRoosevelt is dead, sir. This guy Truman was in the Army--in the last\nwar and the Army is going to take him right over and run him and the\nWhite House inside of six weeks. Hell, I wouldn't put it past them to\ntry to have the Army swallow up the Navy. So don't annoy Wakely if you\ncan help it, Grant.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"If it's the last thing Z-2 ever does, Admiral,\" I\ntold him, \"I still want to make a Major-General get up early in the\nmorning in order to see me.\"\n\nBallister grinned. \"Grant,\" he said. \"How come you never thought of\njoining the Navy. We could use men like you. Get in touch with me if\nanything happens to Z-2. This here war may be just about won but then\nthere's no armistice in the battle of Washington.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\n\nThere is no point in describing the various problems of logistics\ninvolved in my reaching General Wakely's office in the Pentagon early\non Sunday morning. All the Pentagon stories have been invented and\ntold, including my favorite yarn of the German spy who was told to bomb\nthe building but decided to disobey his orders because there was no\npoint in robbing the Third Reich of its greatest asset.\n\nWakely was a bluff, hearty type of soldier, with more bluff than heart,\nwho greeted me without emotion, waved me to a chair and proceeded to\nget down to cases.\n\n\"I've decided, Grant, and the Chief of Staff agrees,\" he informed\nme, \"that the time has come to liquidate Z-2. All of these irregular\nagencies have been nothing but a nuisance since before Pearl Harbor.\nZ-2 has been in the Army's hair for years. We've heard nothing good of\nyour outfit.\"\n\n\"You are fully entitled to your point of view, General,\"--I\nhave observed that Generals do not go for \"Sir!\" as eagerly as\nAdmirals--\"but the decision rests with the White House. All I do is to\nfollow my orders.\"\n\nGeneral Wakely exhumed a ghastly smile. \"The White House ain't what\nit used to be, Grant,\" he continued. \"While Roosevelt was President\nwe couldn't do much about it, but now, by gad! the time has come to\ncoordinate the White House. This Z-2 business is played out anyhow.\"\n\nI started to say something soothing but the Chief of Military\nIntelligence refused to yield the floor.\n\n\"I've been checking on you, Grant,\" he told me, \"since Ballister\nphoned me yesterday. We have a pretty good counter-intelligence corps\nin this country and I'm told that your name isn't Grant at all, but\nTompkins--W. S. Tompkins. You're linked to a fellow in the Navy named\nJacklin. No use pretending, Grant. Z-2 may be smart but our information\nis that Jacklin is probably a double-spy for the Nazis. In fact, we\nbelieve that Jacklin is really the notorious Von Bieberstein. We were\non his trail long before Pearl Harbor. He's a slick article, Von\nBieberstein is. We think that when things began to get hot he joined\nthe Navy, knowing that the Army couldn't touch him there. Then he seems\nto have planted his common-law wife or mistress--an American born girl,\nmind you,--in O.S.S. to keep him informed of Army operations. No,\nTompkins, we have him now. We have rounded up all his contacts and\naccomplices.\"\n\n\"General,\" I assured him, \"somebody's eaten a bad clam. I can vouch for\nJacklin's loyalty as I would my own. Why, he was editor of a Republican\nnewspaper and went to Yale. He was at school with me. I've known him\nfor over thirty years. He's as patriotic as I am.\"\n\nThis was not going as well as I had hoped. If it hadn't been for the\nF.B.I. waiting to snap me up, I would have backed out of Wakely's\noffice on some excuse, however lame.\n\nWakely snorted. \"It just shows how far-sighted the Germans are. They\nplant their agents here twenty--thirty--fifty years--yes, generations\nbefore they are needed. Gad! this country's been asleep. Here M.I.D.'s\nbeen hunting Von Bieberstein for the last ten years and what do we\nfind? We find that he's lived in this country all his life and holds a\nreserve commission in the United States Navy! No wonder we had Pearl\nHarbor! This time, Grant, we're sure of our facts and we're going to\ntake them to the White House.\"\n\n\"You may be sure of your facts, General,\" I agreed, \"but do you happen\nto know a man named Axel Roscommon?\"\n\nWakely nodded. \"Of course, a thorough gentleman. See him every week or\nso at the Army-Navy Club. Well-informed, too.\"\n\n\"Did he ever tell you that he's head of Nazi intelligence in this\ncountry?\"\n\n\"Rubbish!\" The head of G-2 detonated impressively. \"He's nothing of\nthe kind. That's nothing but a smear put out against him by the F.B.I.\"\n\n\"Well, General,\" I admitted, \"I'm wasting your time. I have some\nreports--\"\n\n\"Just a minute, Grant. I'm not done with you. We're going to finish\nthis Z-2 business right now.\" He pushed a button and uttered into his\ndesk-phone: \"Sergeant! Bring those women in here.\"\n\nA moment later the door opened and Dorothy, Germaine and Virginia\nappeared, each looking as bedraggled as any woman who has been awakened\ntoo early.\n\n\"Winnie!\" Germaine's face lighted up like a traffic go-sign. She\ncrossed the room and kissed me. \"I thought--\"\n\nGeneral Wakely coughed, severely.\n\n\"Mrs. Tompkins,\" he announced, \"I'm Major-General Wakely. This is G-2.\nThe C.I.C. has rounded up your husband's chief associates for this\ninterview. We're about to close in on the most dangerous Nazi spy-ring\nin existence. You know Mrs. Rutherford, of course, and this other woman\ngoes under the name of Mrs. Jacklin.\"\n\n\"My name _is_ Mrs. Jacklin,\" Dorothy replied with feeling, \"and the\nO.S.S. will want to know by what authority--\"\n\nWakely waved her and the O.S.S. aside. \"Very clever, Mrs. Jacklin,\nor should I say Mrs. Von Bieberstein?\" He turned back to Germaine.\n\"Thanks in part to your husband, Mrs. Tompkins,\" he continued, \"we\nhave at last got on the track of Hitler's ace operative in the Western\nHemisphere, Kurt Von Bieberstein, or should I say Frank Jacklin? We\nalmost had him cornered five years ago but he took advantage of the\nconfusion after Pearl--after the Navy let us--after the declaration of\nwar, and went into hiding as a naval officer. It was only by accident,\nwhen Mr. Tompkins accidentally supplied the missing link, that we found\nthe trail again.\"\n\n\"That's handsome of you, General,\" I said, \"but I think that\nCounter-Intelligence deserves full credit.\"\n\nHe beamed at me.\n\n\"And what am I doing here, General Wakely?\" Virginia cooed at the\nspecimen of military manhood.\n\nWakely smiled before he remembered that he was a pattern of military\nefficiency. \"You are known to Counter-Intelligence, Mrs. Rutherford, as\none of the best agents in Z-2.\"\n\n\"But what is Z-2?\" Virginia was frankly bemused. \"Of course, I've heard\nof Intelligence. Isn't that something that belongs to the Army?\"\n\nThe General oozed approval. \"Gad! Tompkins, you train your agents\nwell. She'd never admit a syllable without your permission. No, Mrs.\nRutherford, Z-2 is to be liquidated and we're here to find this fellow\nVon Bieberstein.\"\n\nDorothy stood up. \"I've heard all the drivel I propose to stand for,\"\nshe announced. \"Frank is a decent, loyal American and it's not his\nfault that we couldn't get along together. I've never heard of Von\nBieberstein in my life. Mr. Tompkins,\" she added, turning to me, \"if\nyou had anything to do with this high-handed foolishness--you say you\nknew Frank--\"\n\n\"Mrs. Jacklin,\" I told her. \"I don't think that your husband, and I\nknew him well, was disloyal for one moment of his life. In any case,\nmilitary intelligence can't lay a finger on your husband.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" Wakely demanded.\n\n\"Because he's dead, General,\" I said.\n\n\"Suicide, eh?\"\n\n\"No, sir. He went down with--\"\n\n\"Winnie!\" Jimmie interrupted me as though descending from a fiery\ncloud. \"_Now_ I see why you've been acting so strangely. You're in\n_intelligence_. Of course you couldn't tell _anybody_. Darling!\"\n\nEven the General looked embarrassed.\n\nDorothy did not relax. \"I am going to leave this room and this\nbuilding,\" she announced. \"And if anybody interferes with me, you are\nall witnesses that I am being detained illegally. Just call the O.S.S.\nand tell them that Army agents under General Wakely's orders broke into\nmy bedroom at six this morning and kidnapped me.\"\n\nShe turned and left the room. Nobody stopped her. Wakely pressed the\nbuzzer again. \"Sergeant!\" he commanded, \"see that Mrs. Jacklin is\nescorted out of the building and that our people keep an eye on her.\"\n\n\"Now, Tompkins,\" the General resumed, \"what's this word about Von\nBieberstein being dead?\"\n\n\"If you'll have the ladies leave the room, General,\" I told him, \"I'll\ngive you my report.\"\n\nJimmie and Virginia withdrew, with visible reluctance.\n\n\"Jacklin is dead,\" I told him. \"I think that your agents are mistaken\nin linking him to Von Bieberstein. In fact, I know it, because I think\nI know who Von Bieberstein really is. But I can't tell you without\ndirect verbal authority from the President. I can tell you how Jacklin\ndied.\"\n\nMajor-General Wakely became once more the man of action. \"Good, let's\nhave it!\"\n\n\"The Navy Department,\" I began, \"has been trying to beat the Army with\nthe development of an atomic bomb--\"\n\n\"The dastards!\" Wakely all but screamed. \"The dirty, treacherous,\nsneaking dastards! You can't trust the Navy as far as you could throw\na battleship. By Gad! Tompkins, _this_ is going straight to the White\nHouse.\"\n\n\"They had a man named Chalmis who did something with thorium, General,\"\nI continued. \"I'm not a scientist so I can't tell you about the\nprocess. It was simpler and less expensive than what General Groves is\ntrying to do with uranium.\"\n\n\"Groves!\" Wakely spoke with soldierly pride. \"Now there's a West\nPointer for you! Four years and two billion dollars and he hasn't got\nit yet, but by Gad! the old West Point spirit never accepts defeat.\nHe'll get a bomb if it takes fifty years and a hundred billion dollars.\nThe Navy can't match that kind of guts, Tompkins. They're all yellow,\nthe Annapolis crowd!\"\n\n\"Of course this thing wasn't anything like so good as the Army's bomb,\nGeneral,\" I assured him. \"It was something whipped up in eighteen\nmonths and cost less than fifty millions.\"\n\n\"Pikers!\"\n\n\"Well, the Navy rushed through this sneak-bomb of theirs and sent\nChalmis with it on a surprise raid against the Kuriles, on the latest\nlight carrier, the Alaska.\"\n\nWakely took a few portentous notes on a memo pad.\n\n\"Jacklin was assigned to the Alaska and our information is\nthat he was with Chalmis in the ship's magazine when the\nbomb--er--accidentally--er--went off. The ship was a total loss and\neveryone aboard died in the explosion.\"\n\nWakely got to his feet and stood rigid for a moment.\n\n\"He was a brave man, Tompkins,\" he observed with soldierly emotion, \"a\ndamned brave man. By Gad, I'm almost sorry we're going to liquidate\nZ-2. We'd like to take you all over into M.I.D. but red tape won't let\nus, eh? Have to be in uniform, under West Pointers or it isn't regular.\nSo Jacklin was one of your men and he died for the Army. He sank the\nAlaska and killed himself and the inventor of the thorium bomb, rather\nthan let the Navy get away with this outrage. By Gad, Tompkins, General\nGroves will have a laugh over that one. I'll go and apologize to Mrs.\nJacklin in person for our mistake. Von Bieberstein would never have\ndone that job. As you know, it's the Nazis who are backing the Navy\nagainst the Army. If it wasn't for the Japs backing us against the Navy\nwe'd have a rough time of it in this man's war. Now Tompkins, this\nthing is too big for us to handle. It's got to go up to the highest\nechelons.\"\n\nI raised my eyebrows.\n\nHe nodded. \"Yes, this has got to be laid before President Truman\nhimself. By Gad, Tompkins, I'll see that you get to report to the\nPresident tomorrow morning if I have to take you there myself.\"\n\n\"As to Von Bieberstein, General,\" I said, \"he can wait until tomorrow.\nWhen you know who he is and where he is placed--with the President's\npermission--you will probably decide to go away. After all, even you\nwould hesitate to arrest on a treason charge the--\" I stopped.\n\nWakely leaned across his desk. \"Tompkins,\" he assured me, \"I'll get Von\nBieberstein if it's the last thing I ever do. By Gad! If you help me,\nI'll see that you get the Order of Merit, a Presidential citation and\nthe Orange Heart.\"\n\n\"Don't you mean the Purple Heart?\" I asked.\n\nWakely snorted. \"That's merely for combat duty. The Orange Heart is a\nconfidential decoration given to those who serve intelligence well on\nthe home front, even including civilians. It's like the Army E-Award\nbut is personal and worn on the _inside_ of the coat-lapel. It is\nconferred on the recommendation of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-2.\"\n\nHe buzzed again. \"Sergeant!\" he barked. \"Get me the office of the\nMilitary Aide, the White House, and if they don't answer, wake up Harry\nVaughan at Blair House, even if he's still in bed, which he probably\nis--the lucky stiff! Tell him this is top-priority.\"\n\nI sighed. The water was already far over my head, but it was too late\nto draw back. I had to swim for the farther shore.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\n\n\"The President will see you now, Mr. Tompkins,\" said the White House\nusher, as he beckoned me to follow him.\n\nA pleasant, rangy, mild-mannered man rose from behind the great desk\nand shook my hand.\n\n\"Glad to see you, Mr. Tompkins,\" he said. \"General Vaughan has been\ntelling me great things about your work. What can I do for you?\"\n\nAs I looked at the guileless, friendly face, my heart sank. Here was\none man who should not be deceived. It would be as easy as stuffing a\nballot box.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" I told him, \"when I left the Pentagon Building\nyesterday, I had an elaborate report to submit to you. But I decided\nthat the President of the United States was entitled to the simple\ntruth.\"\n\n\"That's right!\" snapped the Chief Executive.\n\n\"So if you'll listen to me for five minutes,\" I continued, \"I'll tell\nyou the strangest story you ever heard.\"\n\nPresident Truman coughed. \"General Vaughan has told me of the fine\nwork you've been doing for Z-2,\" he observed. \"As you can imagine, I'm\nterribly busy taking on this job.\"\n\n\"Mr. President,\" I began, \"to begin with, there's no such organization\nas Z-2. If you'll listen for a few minutes I'll tell you the whole\nstory.\"\n\nI did.\n\nAt the end of it, he smiled at me.\n\n\"Mr. Tompkins,\" he said, \"you're a married man, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. President.\"\n\n\"Then you tell Mrs. Tompkins for me that I want her to take you home\nand take good care of you for the next few weeks. You've been overdoing\nit. This Z-2 work has taken it out of you. You need a rest. Now don't\nyou worry about Z-2,\" he continued. \"What you need to do is to take\nthings easy. The work will go right ahead. I'm putting Z-2 under\nGeneral Wakely. This country needs better intelligence services and\nthey ought to be concentrated under one responsible head, if you ask\nme.\"\n\n\"But I tell you, Mr. President,\" I insisted, \"there never was such an\norganization as Z-2. I invented it in order to clear myself with the\nF.B.I.\"\n\nHe flashed a boyish grin at me. \"But there's no doubt that the Alaska\nwent down like a stone?\"\n\n\"She went up like a sky-rocket, sir.\"\n\n\"Then this thorium bomb doesn't sound as though it was practical,\nsinking one of our ships like that.\"\n\n\"Mr. President,\" I argued, \"any bomb will explode if it is\ndeliberately detonated. This bomb was deliberately touched off by\nProfessor Chalmis. He wanted to prevent its use in warfare.\"\n\nThe President nodded. \"Yes, yes, Mr. Tompkins. You explained that to\nme before. Now you be sure to tell your wife to take good care of you.\nWhen you're rested up, you come on down and see me again and we'll talk\nsome more about this Z-2 work of yours. We can use men like you in the\nState Department. I'm sorry I don't know more about it, but all of\nPresident Roosevelt's papers have been removed from the White House and\nI don't even know what he told Stalin at Yalta. Perhaps you'd better\ntalk to the State Department before you take that rest. That's what\nthey're for. Thank you for seeing me.\"\n\nTwo beefy Secret Service men appeared in the doorway.\n\n\"Is there any particular man I should see at the Department, sir?\" I\nasked. \"I want to get this whole business cleared up.\"\n\nThe President stood up and shook my hand in dismissal. \"Just go across\nthe street and tell them I sent you,\" he said. \"Good day to you, sir.\"\n\nThe two body-guards closed in on me, so I bowed slightly and withdrew\nfrom the President's office.\n\nIn the anteroom, I found General Wakely pacing up and down like the\nfather of triplets.\n\n\"How did it go, Tompkins?\" he asked. \"You had five extra minutes.\nDid you get a chance to give him a fill-in about the Navy and\nyou-know-what?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"My orders are not to discuss that matter any further,\nGeneral,\" I told him.\n\n\"But what about Von Bieberstein?\" the chief of M.I.D. demanded. \"Can\nyou give me a lead?\"\n\n\"My instructions, General,\" I said, \"are to discuss matters with the\nState Department.\"\n\n\"The State Department!\" Wakely was outraged. \"Why, they're nothing but\na bunch of Reds! They tell me there are men over there who have spent\n_years_ in Russia.\"\n\n\"If I am ever allowed to tell you who Von Bieberstein really is,\" I\ntold the General, \"you will understand why I am not allowed to discuss\nit with you now. This is a matter for the Big Three. It is out of my\nhands entirely.\"\n\nAt the gate of the White House drive I was suddenly halted by a\npiercing \"Hi!\" It was Virginia Rutherford. She dodged her way between\ntwo stalwart sentries and took my arm.\n\n\"Winnie!\" she cooed, as soon as we were across Pennsylvania Avenue,\n\"you utter devil!\"\n\nIt seemed safest to say nothing.\n\n\"Winnie,\" she continued. \"Do you realize that the Army of the United\nStates dragged me out of bed yesterday morning and flew me down here\njust to discover that you are a bigger liar than I thought you were?\"\n\n\"Please don't blame me for General Wakely,\" I told her. \"He's an Eagle\nScout in high places. I was getting on fine until you showed up, and\nplease don't raise your voice at me. If I know the Army, you and I are\nbeing tailed right now by the counter-intelligence.\"\n\nVirginia snuggled closer to me, as we dodged through the crowd in\nLaFayette Park watching the White House.\n\n\"To think,\" she said dreamily, \"that all this time you have been an\nAmerican secret service agent. Ain't that something?\"\n\nAgain it seemed safest to say nothing.\n\n\"Yes, Winnie Tompkins, super-sleuth!\" she continued with an edge on\nher voice you could have shaved with. \"All last winter, when I was\nunder the impression that we were canoodling from bar to bar, you were\nworking for Uncle Sam! It's one of the best stories of the war, Winnie.\nSleep with Tompkins and lick the Axis!\"\n\nThis was getting under my hide. \"Virginia,\" I told her, \"I have just\nspent the last twenty minutes trying to convince President Truman that\nI'm not a secret agent. He will have none of it. He says I've been\nworking too hard and need a rest.\"\n\n\"You devil!\" Virginia chuckled dangerously. \"You absolute, utter\ndemon! Here is civilization at the crossroads and what does Winfred\nS. Tompkins do to amuse himself. He strolls down to Washington and\npersuades the Generals and the Admirals and the President that he has\nbeen winning the war for them instead of winning the wife of his family\nphysician. That's what I call funny.\"\n\n\"Have it your own way,\" I agreed. \"If you can persuade General Wakely\nthat I'm a fake, more power to you. He believes that you are one of my\nbest operatives and nothing can shake him.\"\n\n\"So that's what you call them? Your operatives? That's wonderful. If\nI'm ever asked, 'Grandma, what did _you_ do in the second Great War?'\nI'll say, Johnnie I was an operative under W. S. Tompkins, the ace\nAmerican Agent.\"\n\n\"Would you mind not talking quite so loud,\" I again begged her. \"Those\ntwo men following us might misunderstand.\"\n\nShe glanced over her shoulder. \"You mean those five men following us,\ndon't you, Winnie?\"\n\nI looked behind us. She was right. A group of five, if not six, people\nwere trailing along behind us. Lamb and the F.B.I., Ballister and the\nNavy, as well as the Army's counter-intelligence and the O.S.S., were\nprobably represented.\n\n\"Five is right,\" I agreed. \"You see, Virginia, I'm a pretty important\nperson. You noticed, I hope, that President Truman took time out to\nchat with me.\"\n\n\"What's he like?\" she asked irrelevantly. \"Of course, Roosevelt was\nall wrong but he had something on the ball. Who's this little guy from\nMontana, anyhow?\"\n\n\"Missouri,\" I corrected her. \"He's from Missouri and don't you ever\nforget it. That's what he is, Virginia, a little guy from Missouri.\"\n\nWe were at the Willard.\n\n\"Here, Virginia, I must leave you,\" I told her. \"You can't follow me\nup to my bedroom and anyhow I have a message for Jimmie from the\nPresident of the United States.\"\n\n\"Nuts!\" she answered brightly. \"You're not fooling me for one little\nminute. You've just lied yourself into a bigger jam than you've lied\nyourself out of. Well, I'm on to your game.\"\n\nWhen I reached the room, there was no sign of Jimmie. This statement\nshould be qualified. She herself was not to be seen but various\narticles of clothing were scattered around the room and there was a\nrush and gurgle of water from the bathroom which suggested that my wife\nwas taking a bath. She was.\n\n\"Winnie?\" she called through the half-open door.\n\n\"Theesa tha floor-waiter,\" I grunted. \"You wanta me? I busy.\"\n\n\"Waiter,\" she commanded, \"please leave the room at once.\"\n\n\"What'sa alla so secret, hey?\" I asked, still speaking in subject-race\nstyle. \"Letta me see!\"\n\nI took the handle of the door, wrenched it open and pushed. There was\nan angry screech from inside, followed by an indignant, \"Winnie, you\nbeast! Get out of here!\"\n\nI didn't, so Jimmie dropped the bath towel she had draped defensively\nacross her shoulders and subsided laughing into a warm, soapy bath.\n\n\"You are the absolute limit!\" she declared. \"I'll never forgive you for\nthis. Tell me, what the President was like?\"\n\n\"Very nice,\" I said. \"He reminds me of one time I saw a little\nfresh-water college football team play Notre Dame. You sort of wanted\nthe little guys to make at least one first down, but you knew that\nif they did, it would just be an accident. No, Truman's one hell of\na nice guy but that doesn't mean he could lick Joe Louis. Anyhow, he\nwas complimentary about my work and he sent a message to you. Pity he\ncouldn't deliver it in person, like the floor-waiter.\"\n\n\"For me?\"\n\nI nodded. \"He said that I needed a good long rest and that you must\ntake very good care of me.\"\n\nShe looked up at me, large-eyed, through a haze of steam.\n\n\"Oh, Winnie,\" she declared. \"I _am_ so proud of you. To think that all\nthe time you've been doing secret intelligence! And I believed you were\njust chasing around after those silly girls. Don't you think you could\nhave trusted your wife?\" she asked.\n\nI shook my head emphatically. \"That was part of my cover,\" I replied.\n\"If you hadn't been worried about me it wouldn't have looked natural.\nIf I'd told you, you wouldn't have worried and the Axis agents--\" I\nleft the thought trailing.\n\nGermaine sucked reflectively on the corner of her wash-cloth. \"Yes,\"\nshe agreed at last, \"I can see that, but I don't see how I can ever\ntrust you again.\"\n\nI laughed. \"Then don't trust me,\" I told her. \"We'll still have a good\ntime. Suppose you get dressed now and come downstairs and we'll have\nchampagne cocktails to celebrate.\"\n\n\"Celebrate what?\" she asked, loosing the stopper with her toes.\n\n\"Celebrate the liquidation of Z-2,\" I said. \"It's being taken over by\nthe Army. My work is done anyhow. And tomorrow I have to see the State\nDepartment. Mr. Truman tells me they need men like me--God help them!\"\n\n\"The State Department!\" She jumped out of the tub, scattering water\nlavishly on the floor and on me. \"Are they going to make you an\nAmbassador or something?\"\n\n\"Come down to earth, Jimmie,\" I urged her. \"I'm a Republican from New\nYork; not a Democrat. I may have done an even better job than they\nthink I've done, but I know one thing I didn't do to qualify for a\ndiplomatic job.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" she asked, towelling herself vigorously.\n\n\"I never contributed a dime to the Democratic National Committee,\" I\nconfessed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\n\nThere was a brisk knock on the bedroom door. I walked over and\nopened it, to see F.B.I. Special Agent A. J. Harcourt. He gave me a\nreproachful glance and pushed his way into the room.\n\n\"I can only stop a minute, Mr. Tompkins,\" he said, \"but I have orders\nfrom the Director to call on you in person and present the apologies of\nthe Bureau for having inconvenienced you. If you had only told us you\nwere connected with Z-2 there would have been no trouble.\"\n\n\"Sit down, Harcourt,\" I urged him. Then I crossed to the bathroom door.\n\"Don't come out until you're decent, dear,\" I called to Germaine. \"The\nF.B.I. is here.\"\n\nSome muffled instructions answered, so I went around the room and\npicked up the various scattered wisps of silk and rayon, and thrust\nthem through to my wife.\n\n\"That's all I was to say, Mr. Tompkins,\" Harcourt repeated, still\nstanding, \"that the Bureau is mighty sorry about the whole business.\"\n\n\"Sit down!\" I told him again. \"Now get this Z-2 thing straight.\nThere isn't any Z-2. I just invented it, trying to get myself out of\nthis jam. I never was a Z-2 agent. What I told these people was all\nmoonshine.\"\n\nHarcourt nodded. \"We know, of course, that you're not allowed to admit\nyou're in Z-2 to anybody but the top guys, but we know that Z-2 does\nexist. If it didn't how could the President abolish it?\"\n\n\"How's that again?\" I asked, sinking into the one easy chair.\n\n\"Yeah, special confidential Executive Order No. 1734, signed today,\nabolishing Z-2 and transferring its duties to the War Department.\nThere was something else, too, about giving you the Order of Merit for\n_quote_ special services which contributed usefully to the conduct of\nthe war. _Unquote._\"\n\n\"Listen here, Harcourt,\" I insisted. \"I can't help it if the President\npulled a boner. I _told_ him there wasn't any such thing as Z-2 and\nall he said was that I ought to take a good long rest. I simply got\nso damned tired of trying to prove that I couldn't remember what\nWinnie Tompkins had been doing before April 2, that I invented my own\nalibi--Z-2.\"\n\nHarcourt scratched his head.\n\n\"Cross my heart and hope to die,\" I assured him.\n\nFor the first time since he had delivered his wooden official apology,\nthe Special Agent relaxed. \"That's one for the book,\" he said with\ndeep feeling. \"Mrs. Harcourt's little boy isn't going to let it go any\nfarther. So far, only the President of the United States, the Army, the\nNavy, O.S.S. and the F.B.I. believe you were in Z-2. I'm not sticking\nmy neck out to tell them it's all a lot of malarkey. That leaves only\nthe State Department and the Secret Service. How come you've skipped\nthem? You must be slipping, Mr. Tompkins.\"\n\n\"I'm seeing the State Department tomorrow morning,\" I explained. \"I\nthink I'll let the Secret Service alone. Incidentally, Mrs. Tompkins\nalso believes all this Z-2 business. It will do as a stall until I\nlearn what I was really doing before I drew a blank.\"\n\n\"Not for me!\"\n\nWe both looked up. In the doorway--which I must have forgotten to\nlatch--stood Virginia Rutherford.\n\n\"No Winnie\"--she began. \"Oh, hullo, Mr. Harcourt--You haven't fooled\nme. I know there's something behind all this business. Imagine the\nnerve of that silly General, practically jerking me out of bed to come\ndown and listen to him babble about Von Bieberstein to that pretty Mrs.\nJacklin. Who is this Von Bieberstein anyhow? He sounds like a brewer.\"\n\n\"Kurt Von Bieberstein,\" explained A. J. Harcourt, \"is supposed to be\nthe ace Nazi Operative in the U.S.A. The Bureau has been trying to\nlocate him for the last ten years. We don't know what he looks like,\nnothing about him, except his name. All we ever got on him was one\nfragment of a short-wave message in 1935 and a letter in a code we\ncouldn't break, just before Pearl Harbor.\"\n\nThe bathroom door opened and Germaine entered the room. \"Well,\nVirginia,\" she observed, \"you seem to be making yourself at home. Mr.\nHarcourt, have I no legal right to privacy in my hotel room?\"\n\nHarcourt rose and bowed. \"Certainly, ma'am,\" he told her. \"If you\nobject to her presence you are entitled to order her out. If she\nrefuses to go, you can throw her out or call the house detective.\"\n\nJimmie laughed. \"Good! Virginia Rutherford, you get out of my bedroom\nor I'll throw you out.\"\n\nVirginia relaxed back against the pillow. \"Act your age, dearest,\" she\nsaid. \"You don't want any public scandal about your husband, do you?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Germaine paused. \"Of course not!\"\n\nThere was another knock on the door.\n\n\"Come in!\" we chorused.\n\nThis time it was Dorothy Jacklin.\n\n\"Oh!\" she exclaimed, none too brightly. \"So we're all here.\"\n\n\"This is Mr. Harcourt of the F.B.I., Mrs. Jacklin,\" I said. \"He's an\nold friend of mine.\"\n\nDorothy turned to me. \"There's one thing I'd like cleared up, Mr.\nTompkins,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes?\" I asked.\n\n\"I certified to O.S.S. that you were with Z-2. I've checked over our\nconfidential files and I can't find any record of Z-2. Things like that\ngo on my efficiency rating and I might get into trouble. After all,\nyou were admitted to the Administration Building without the usual\nreferences and identification. General Donovan is very strict about\nsuch things.\"\n\n\"There is no such thing as Z-2, Mrs. Jacklin,\" I assured her.\n\n\"Aha!\" Virginia chortled, \"here it comes.\"\n\n\"Winnie!\" Germaine was hurt.\n\n\"President Truman just today signed a special order abolishing Z-2\nand transferring its duties to the War Department. If you need the\nreferences for the O.S.S. record that dear little colonel of yours can\nget it from General Wakely at G-2. That's right, isn't it, Harcourt?\"\n\n\"That's right, Mr. Tompkins. All government intelligence agencies have\nbeen notified. When you get back to your office, Mrs. Jacklin, you'll\nfind that O.S.S. has a copy of the order.\"\n\nDorothy turned to me. \"Isn't that lousy!\" she exclaimed. \"After all\nthe splendid work Z-2 did, to have the Army take it over and grab the\ncredit!\"\n\nI shrugged my shoulders. \"It's what we expect in this government\ngame,\" I said. \"A passion for anonymity is not only expected of us,\nit's rammed down our throats. Only Admirals and Generals are good\nat intelligence. Period. However, I'm just as glad it's over. The\nPresident told me to take a rest and I think it's a good idea.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Germaine. \"Of all ingratitude!\"\n\n\"I think the best idea is for us all to go downstairs and have some\nchampagne cocktails,\" I suggested. \"Things often seem better that way.\"\n\nHarcourt looked grave. \"I'm not allowed to drink on duty, Mr.\nTompkins,\" he observed, \"but I'm not on duty now. Come on, Mrs.\nJacklin,\" he continued, \"let's go on and show them.\"\n\nDorothy looked startled. \"Show them what,\" she asked.\n\n\"Show them that we intelligence services can take it ma'am,\" the\nSpecial Agent observed. \"You're O.S.S. and I'm F.B.I. and these others\nhave just been consolidated out of the game.\"\n\nDorothy flashed him a smile. \"Well--\" she began doubtfully.\n\n\"Go ahead, Harcourt,\" I urged with malice aforethought. \"Show her a\nphoto of your wife and three children in Brooklyn.\"\n\nHe grinned. \"That gag was strictly for Miss Briggs,\" he said, \"but down\nhere I'm an unmarried man.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Dorothy. \"I never saw an administrator down here yet who\nlet himself worry about a wife and family somewhere else. The F.B.I.\nmust be weakening.\"\n\nHarcourt smiled. \"Well, anyhow, Mrs. Jacklin, ma'm, the first round of\ndrinks is on me--just to celebrate Mr. Tompkins' happy release.\"\n\nI didn't care so much for that one. \"Expense account, you spy-catcher?\"\nI asked.\n\nThe Special Agent nodded. \"Yep,\" he agreed. \"My own expense. I was\nordered to apologize handsome to you, sir, for the Bureau, and by gum\nwe Harcourts do it right. What'll it be? Root beer or Moxie?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning, early if not bright, found me fumbling my way around\nthe corridors of the State-War-Navy building in search of the proper\nofficial to handle secret intelligence reports. I finally unearthed him\nin the form of six-feet of languid Bond Street tailored perfection--a\nred-headed diplomat lily by the name of Dennis Tyler, Chief of the\nLiaison Section. To him I addressed myself.\n\n\"Oh, yes, so you're Tompkins--of Z-2,\" he observed. \"Yes, yes. Quite\ntoo tragic for you.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Mr. Tyler,\" I inquired, \"did you ever hear of Axel Roscommon?\"\n\nTyler leaned back in his chair and contemplated me soulfully. \"Now\ndon't tell me that poor old Axel is a Nazi agent, Mr. Timkins--\"\n\n\"Tompkins, Mr. Wiley.\"\n\n\"The name is Tyler, Mr. Tompkins,\" he grinned. \"No, dear old boy--to\nquote Axel--we do not _think_ that Mr. Roscommon is a Nazi Agent. We\nknow it. I had the devil of a time fixing it up with the F.B.I. so\nthey wouldn't arrest him. We can't let the Swiss--God bless their\ncuckoo-clocks--represent Hitler over here. We need a man of the world\nwho realizes that milk chocolate has no place in diplomacy, to maintain\ncontact with the Third Reich. No, Axel's a fine fellow. He's on a\nstrict allowance. One military secret a month--usually a little one\nand every now and then a phoney--so as to keep his job. He sees that\nour people in Berlin get the same allowance. All very cozy and no harm\ndone.\"\n\nI nodded agreement. \"Yes, Mr. Tyler,\" I told him, \"I know the\npicture. It's just that I have a hunch that Roscommon may be Kurt Von\nBieberstein.\"\n\nTyler exploded. \"Absolute, obscene rot, Tompkins! Not a word of\ntruth in it. Roscommon is foxy, if you like, but he hasn't got Von\nBieberstein's ruthlessness. No, we made a thorough check on our Axel,\nbefore we let the Gestapo accredit him to this government. He's just a\ngood contact-man and a first-rate field operative--plays a dashing game\nof backgammon and a sound hand of poker, holds his liquor well, and,\nwith an unlimited expense account, stands unlimited rounds of drinks.\nNo, we can't get on without Axel Roscommon. He's taken half the sting\nout of my income-tax, he's so lavish with his friends.\n\n\"What on earth made you confuse him with Von Bieberstein?\" he\nconcluded. \"Kurt's a devil. He's slipped through the fingers of every\nAllied intelligence service. Even the Gestapo doesn't know much about\nhim. He's never been photographed or fingerprinted and he reports\ndirectly to Hitler. Even Himmler has no file on him.\"\n\n\"It was only this, Mr. Tyler,\" I told him. \"It was Roscommon who warned\nme two days before Roosevelt's death that the President would die\nwithin the week. That isn't easy to laugh off.\"\n\nTyler became deadly calm. \"Don't ever repeat that story outside of this\nroom,\" he warned me. \"We know who did it and why. We'll settle that\nscore some day. In the meantime, just forget it, unless you don't mind\ndiving into the East River in a concrete life-belt.\"\n\n\"Then Roscommon wasn't guessing,\" I observed.\n\n\"Of course he wasn't guessing. As a matter of fact, it was I who told\nhim. Just as it was I who told F.D.R. God! He was a good sport. He\nlistened to what I had to say and then do you know what he did? He\nlaughed. He said that so many Americans had died in this war that one\nmore made no difference and he ordered me to hold off until after the\npeace treaty before getting the group responsible.\"\n\nThis was getting too deep for me, but I owed it to Germaine to make a\ngrab for the brass ring.\n\n\"President Truman was very complimentary about my work for Z-2,\" I\ntold him. \"He wants me to take a rest now that the War Department has\ntaken over our work. After that, I wondered whether there mightn't be\nsomething in the diplomatic service. The President thought I would be\nuseful here. I've plenty of money and--\"\n\nDennis Tyler groaned convulsively, hunched forward over his desk and\nclutched his flaming red head in his hands.\n\n\"--and you have a beautiful wife who would make a charming American\nAmbassadress, no doubt: Yes, Mr. Tompkins, I see it all. You went to\na good school, no doubt you even attended Harvard. You just missed\ncombat service in the last war and were unfortunately too old for\nthis one. You know how to make money in Wall Street, if it wasn't for\nthose damned Roosevelt taxes. You do not speak French--except for the\npurpose of 'La Vie Parisienne'--nor German nor Italian nor Spanish\nnor Russian, not to mention Arabic and Chinese. You know nothing of\neconomics, sociology, natural science or political geography. You have\nbeen to Canada, the West Indies and no doubt to 'Gay Paree,' and to cap\nthe list of your qualifications, you are a Republican and this is a\nDemocratic Administration.\"\n\n\"Then there isn't a chance,\" I mumbled, my cheeks flaming with\nembarrassment.\n\n\"Did _I_ say that you had no chance?\" demanded Dennis Tyler. \"On the\ncontrary, you seem to be fully qualified for any diplomatic post\nwithin the gift of this Administration, at least as much as any of a\ndozen of our well-named envoys extraordinary. But, Tompkins, you're a\ndecent sort of chap. Don't do it! For your wife's sake, if not mine,\nlet the poor old State Department go to hell in its own quiet way\nwithout speeding the process--Oh, well, I suppose I shall never learn.\nDoubtless you will be our next Ambassador to Portugal and I shall have\none more black mark against me.\"\n\nI held out my hand. \"If the popular demand becomes too great for me\nto resist, Mr. Tyler,\" I assured him, \"I may be forced to accept a\ndiplomatic appointment, but even then you would be safe from me. I\ndon't like double-talk.\"\n\nDennis Tyler looked up, shook my hand and winked broadly at me. \"Just\nbetween us, Tompkins,\" he whispered, \"who put you up to that Z-2 line\nof yours? You have the whole town fooled. No, don't look virtuous, dear\nold boy--again to quote the immortal Axel--I happen to know that you\ncan't possibly be connected with Z-2, because until yesterday, when the\nArmy grabbed it, I was head of Z-2 myself!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\n\n\"You were what?\" I demanded.\n\n\"I am--or was--the head of Z-2,\" Tyler replied. \"You know, Mr.\nTompkins,\" he continued, \"I find it most intensely interesting that\nyou should have picked on that particular combination--Z-2--for your\nhigher echelonics. In fact, I should like to have you psycho-analyzed,\nin order to learn why you, of all people, should have selected the\nsuper-secret insignia of the super-secret Roosevelt intelligence\noutfit. Not that it matters now, of course,\" he added. \"With this new\ngrowth across the street I'd be lucky if the White House knew the\ndifference between Z-2 and B-29.\"\n\nI studied Tyler's face. Who he was, I had only a remote idea, so many\nhad been the different offices that had shunted me around. But in spite\nof his airy-fairy persiflage and la-di-da manner, I felt that he was\nstraight.\n\n\"Okay, chief,\" I said. \"I confess. I robbed the bank but I didn't shoot\nthe cashier. That was Muggsy. You see, chief, it was this way--\"\n\nTyler sat back and heard me out from A to Z-2, in the history of my\nlast two weeks.\n\n\"I can't expect you to believe me, Mr. Tyler,\" I concluded, \"but I'd\nlike to have it on record somewhere in this town that I had told the\ntruth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and all I get for it\nis an Order of Merit citation.\"\n\n\"Few escape it!\" he cried. \"My poor old bewildered Tompkins. Of course\nI believe you. Stranger tales than yours have passed across my desk. I\nhave served under one President who _thought_ he was Jesus Christ, one\nwho _knew_ he was Jesus Christ and two who were afraid the voters would\nrealize that they were _not_ Jesus Christ. I have seen five successive\nSecretaries of State who had no doubt that they were God's Vice-Regent\non earth. As for drawing a blank, Mr. Tompkins, that is no news to this\nDepartment. What we diplomatic underlings fear is when our superiors\nfail to draw blanks. Why I remember--but no matter.\"\n\n\"Then what would you do if you were me, Mr. Tyler?\" I asked him. \"I'm\nthe innocent victim of the damndest set of circumstances ever dreamed\nup.\"\n\nThe red-headed young diplomat looked at me warily. \"The\nDepartment, sir,\" he said, \"does not answer hypodermic--I mean\nhypothetical--questions. What is good enough for the Department is good\nenough for me.\"\n\n\"But here I find myself,\" I reminded him, \"in high favor with the\nintelligence forces and with the reputation of a Don Juan in the bosoms\nof my family, and no idea how I got there.\"\n\nTyler chuckled. \"I always knew they were plural,\" he said. \"Think\nnothing of it. Stupider men than you have stood in far higher repute in\nthis town and the reputation of Don Juan is easily acquired. For all\nyou know, you may be a perfectly sterling family man and quite devoid\nof political intelligence.\"\n\n\"How's that again?\"\n\n\"Just a figure of speech,\" Tyler answered airily. \"Just the same, Mr.\nTompkins, it would be interesting to know why you picked on Z-2 and\nwhere you got your undoubted talent for brass-knuckled duplicity. So\nfar as I can see, you've sold yourself as Z-2 to all the brass hats,\nincluding the Kansas City lad who woke up to find himself President.\"\n\n\"Again in my own defense,\" I said, \"I did it only because the F.B.I.\nhad a gun at my back and were going to give me the works if I didn't\nclear myself inside of twenty-four hours. I always thought,\" I added,\n\"that in this country you were assumed innocent until proved guilty.\"\n\nTyler winked wickedly. \"There's a war on,\" he announced, \"and doesn't\nthe F.B.I. know it!\"\n\nI bade the diplomat good-bye and left the State Department with a\nsense of personal uneasiness. Who would have dreamed that there was a\nZ-2 organization before I imagined it! If this kind of thing kept on\nhappening it mightn't be a bad idea to take a fling at the Hartford\nSanctuary and have myself psyched by experts.\n\n\"Beg pardon, sir, but are you Mr. Tompkins?\"\n\nThe Hart, Shaffner & Marxed youngster who accosted me on the State\nDepartment steps had a definite bulge under his left shoulder that\nwarned me he was armed.\n\n\"Yes, and who are you, sir?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I'm Monaghan from the Secret Service,\" he told me. \"The Chief wants to\nsee you.\"\n\n\"And who is the Chief?\" I asked.\n\n\"Chief Flynn, of course,\" he said. \"It's only a few steps over at the\nthe Treasury Building.\"\n\n\"All right, Mr. Monaghan,\" I agreed. \"I'll come along quietly. Am I\nunder arrest? Should I send for my lawyer?\"\n\n\"The Service don't go much for lawyers,\" he said. \"This way, sir.\"\n\nWith Monaghan at my elbow, I turned right on Pennsylvania Avenue and\nwalked in front of the White House and turned down East Executive\nAvenue to the side-entrance of the Treasury. A few baffling twists and\nturns in the corridors of Morgenthau, and I found myself in a large,\nsparsely furnished room, facing a white haired Irishman.\n\n\"This is Tompkins, Chief,\" Monaghan reported and left me with the\ngimlet-eyed Secret Service executive.\n\n\"You W. S. Tompkins?\" he asked me.\n\n\"Yes. And who are you?\"\n\n\"My name's Flynn.\"\n\nNeither of us said anything for a couple of minutes. He was obviously\nwaiting for me to ask him why I had been brought to him--so I\ndeliberately kept silent, pulled out a cigarette and lighted it. Seeing\nno ash-tray, I flicked the burnt match on the official green carpet and\nwaited for him to open the conversation.\n\n\"So you don't need to be told why you're here, Tompkins,\" he purred.\n\n\"I came here, Mr. Flynn,\" I told him, \"because one of your men\npractically put a gun at my ribs in front of the State Department. What\ndo you want? A ticket to a prize fight? A good write-up in the papers?\nTell me what it will cost me and I'll pay within reason. I didn't know\nthat the Irish had got control of the Secret Service or I would have\nmailed the money ahead--in cash, of course, no checks, all small bills\nnot consecutively numbered.\"\n\nFlynn scowled out the window in the general direction of the White\nHouse. I dropped some more cigarette ash on the carpet.\n\nSuddenly he whirled to me. \"We're here to protect the President,\" he\nsnapped, \"and we don't propose to take any lip from you.\"\n\nI said nothing. Then I noticed the flag over the White House at\nhalf-mast.\n\n\"Why's that flag at half-mast, Mr. Flynn,\" I asked.\n\n\"Because the President's dead.\"\n\n\"Was he murdered?\" I asked.\n\n\"He was not! He died of natural causes, but we don't go for people\nplotting to kill any President, even if he's dead. Our job depends on\nit.\"\n\nI rubbed out the stub of my cigarette on the corner of his mahogany\ndesk and lighted another one.\n\n\"Since Roosevelt wasn't murdered, what am I here for?\" I asked. \"I'm\na perfectly respectable New York business man. I'm registered at the\nWillard and my wife can identify me. I have plenty of other references,\nif you need them. The F.B.I., say, or General Wakely in Counter\nIntelligence. If you have anything to ask me, I'll be glad to try to\nanswer questions, but I'm damned if I propose to sit here and let\nmyself be accused of something I never dreamed of doing.\"\n\n\"And what are you going to do about it?\" he asked. \"Sue?\"\n\n\"Oh, I have no doubt that you can beat me up and send me to the\nhospital, but as soon as I'm out I'll tell my story and then I guess a\nman named Flynn will be looking for another job.\"\n\nFlynn smiled. \"And why do you think the hospital will be letting you\ngo, Mr. Tompkins? Of course, if it was only for a broken leg or a\nfractured skull, it would be easy, but what about St. Elizabeth's?\"\n\nI raised my eyebrows.\n\n\"Never heard of it,\" I said.\n\n\"St. Elizabeth's,\" he explained, \"is where we send people in Washington\nwho aren't right in the head. We have a lot of alienists and\npsychiatrists there who can look you over, keep you under observation.\nThey can hold you there as long as they like, because if there's any\nquestion about a man's sanity, they would be failing in their duty if\nthey let him go.\"\n\n\"In other words, Mr. Flynn,\" I interrupted, \"you threaten to send me to\nthe local lunatic asylum if I raise any objection to your methods. Is\nthat the game?\"\n\nFlynn was on familiar ground here. \"Mr. Tompkins,\" he asked me. \"How's\nyour health? You don't look any too good to me. Don't you think you'd\nbe better for a little special care?\"\n\nI laughed admiringly. \"So that's how it's done, is it? Well, I never\nthought the Secret Service was reduced to blackmail. Okay, I'll pay.\"\n\n\"Who ever mentioned pay?\" Flynn was indignant.\n\n\"Nuts!\" I replied. \"Cops are all the same. They jail Capone for income\ntax because they can't convict him of being a racketeer. You think\nyou're being cute by sending people to the booby-hatch if you have no\nproof that they're dangerous. So, go ahead, send me to St. Elizabeth's\nbut don't think for one minute that I'm not on to the Irish.\"\n\nFlynn's face grew slowly and magnificently purple. \"By God!\" he\nshouted. \"What's the matter with Ireland, anyhow?\"\n\n\"Ireland?\" Now he was on my ground. \"Too proud to fight the war for\nfreedom. Ireland? To hell with Ireland! This is the United States of\nAmerica. What has Ireland to do with your duty to the United States?\"\n\nFlynn slumped back in his chair, muttering.\n\n\"Go!\" he said hoarsely. \"Get out of here, get out of this building, get\nout of this town. By God Almighty, if I catch you here within the next\ntwenty-four hours, I--I--\"\n\n\"Scratch a cop and find a four-flusher,\" I observed incautiously.\n\"You're still looking for Booth in Ford's theatre and are figuring ways\nto guard Garfield in the Union Station. For all you know, Roosevelt may\nhave been killed, but if he was, you know I had nothing to do with it.\nThe record shows I'm one of the few people who tried to do anything\nabout it. And you don't dare touch the man who told me.\"\n\n\"Who was that?\" Flynn demanded sullenly.\n\n\"Axel Roscommon,\" I said, \"another Irishman, so you don't dare lay a\nfinger on him.\"\n\n\"Roscommon!\" Flynn snorted. \"A black Protestant from Ulster. He's no\nIrishman, but I can't touch him, as well you know. The bloody British\nin the State Department are protecting him.\"\n\n\"So you take it out on me, eh?\" I suggested.\n\nFlynn drew himself up. \"See here, Mr. Tompkins,\" he said, \"I've told\nyou to get out of Washington and stay out of Washington. In a job like\nmine I have to follow my hunches and my hunch is that if you aren't out\nof here by noon tomorrow we'll send you over to St. Elizabeth's for\nobservation. After all, we can't have people threatening the President.\"\n\n\"When did I ever threaten the President?\"\n\n\"Sure and you did it just now,\" declared the Chief. \"You used\nthreatening and abusive language about the President of the United\nStates, within the meaning of the Act, and the Secret Service is not\ngoing to stand for it.\"\n\n\"In other words, Mr. Flynn,\" I observed, \"You can't win against the\nCops. Anything to keep their job. Okay, I know when I'm licked. I'll\nleave town and I'll even beat you to the booby-hatch. If this is\nsanity, I _want_ to be locked up.\"\n\nChief Flynn hunched his shoulders and scowled at me.\n\n\"Yes,\" I told him, \"I'll check myself with the psychiatrists.\"\n\n\"Mr. Tompkins,\" Flynn remarked quietly, \"the more I see of you the more\nI feel that you ought to have immediate medical attention.\"\n\nHe lifted his telephone and began dialing a number.\n\n\"And won't that look swell on your record,\" I said, \"when President\nTruman gives me a citation for the Order of Merit the same day that\nChief Flynn locks me up as a threat to the President.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Flynn laid down the receiver and looked at me with dawning\nrespect.\n\n\"Oh! is right,\" I replied, and left the room.\n\nNobody tried to stop me as I walked out of the Treasury but I knew\nthat I must take no more chances. From now on it was a race to the\nalienists, and the best hope for continued liberty lay with my getting\nthere first.\n\nI hailed a taxicab. \"Drive me to the Phipps Clinic, Johns Hopkins\nHospital,\" I told the driver.\n\n\"Jeeze, Chief! That's in Baltimore.\"\n\n\"You are absolutely right,\" I told him, \"and it's fifty bucks for you\nif you get me there inside the hour.\"\n\nI sank back on the cushions of the rear seat. I had come out of the\nWashington rat-race worse off than when I had entered it. Then it was\nmerely a question of my liberty. After three days it had become a\nmatter of my sanity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\n\nThe white-coated medical man--he said that he was associate\npsychiatrist at the Phipps Clinic--beckoned me to follow him into a\nside-room. He waved me to be seated and closed the door.\n\n\"You see, Mr. Tompkins,\" he told me, \"everybody's crazy.\"\n\nThere is no point in recounting the stages which had converted my panic\nflight from the wrath of the Secret Service into this interview with\none of Johns Hopkins psychiatric staff, except that I had been amazed\nby the ease with which he had drawn me aside shortly after I had sat\ndown in the waiting-room.\n\n\"Of course I realize, doctor,\" I replied, \"that everyone must be\nabnormal since that is how you establish an average normality. My case\nis so peculiar, though, that I'd like to have you check on me.\"\n\n\"Here we can take you only on the recommendation of a registered\nphysician or psychiatrist,\" he told me. \"We're understaffed and\nover-crowded as it is. My advice to you would be to return to your\nhome--you live near New York, you say--and put yourself in the hands\nof your regular family physician. There are plenty of institutions\nin your part of the country which are fully qualified to give the\nnecessary treatment. Even if you were recommended to us now we could\nonly put you on the waiting list.\"\n\nI murmured something vague about war-conditions and neurotics, but he\nraised his hand like a traffic-cop and interrupted me.\n\n\"The war, at least so far as active service is concerned, has taken a\nload off us, Mr. Tompkins,\" he informed me. \"You see, in normal times\npeople live under any number of pressures which force them to restrain\ntheir natural impulses. War gives them outlets--including sex, a sense\nof gang solidarity, and permission to commit acts of violence and\nhomicide--which would result in jail-sentences for them at other times.\nOf course, there are a good many psychos coming out of actual combat\nbut the government takes care of them. No, the bulk of our current\ncases are essential civilians: generals, administrators, politicians,\nbusiness executives--who find that the war simply redoubles the\npressures on them. Some of them are really insane in the medical sense\nbut their positions are so high that we dare not insist on their\nhospitalization. Instead, we have a simple prescription which most of\nthem find no difficulty in taking. Perhaps it would help in your case.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, just go out and get drunk now and then, and find yourself a\ngirl-friend. Blow off steam, in other words. Find an outlet for your\nnatural impulses. If the White House had consulted me, Roosevelt might\nstill--Oh, well, no use crying over spilt milk. Half the mental trouble\nin this country is due to people trying to be something they are not,\nand the other half is due to people trying not to be something that\nthey naturally are. Primitive people are rarely troubled with neuroses.\"\n\n\"But you said that everybody's crazy, doctor,\" I objected. \"How does\nthat fit into the picture?\"\n\n\"Mr. Tompkins,\" the psychiatrist remarked, \"you must have noticed that\nthe only sane people today are the alleged lunatics, who do what makes\nthem happy. Take the man who thinks he is Napoleon. He _is_ Napoleon\nand is much happier than those who try to tell him that he isn't. The\nreal maniacs are now in control of the asylum. There's a theory among\nthe psychiatrists that certain forms of paranoia are contagious. Every\nnow and then a doctor or a nurse here and at other mental clinics goes\nwhat they call crazy and has to join the patients. My theory is that it\nis sanity which is contagious and that the only sane people are those\nwho have sense enough to be crazy. They are locked up at once for fear\nthat others will go sane, too. Now, take me, I'm--\"\n\nAt that moment two husky young men came in and led him away. After a\nshort interval one of them returned.\n\n\"I'm sorry this happened, sir,\" he apologized. \"Dr. Murdoch is a\ntragic case. He was formerly employed here and every now and then he\nstill manages to escape to one of our consultation rooms. He's quite\nharmless. What was he telling you?\"\n\n\"That the only sane people in the world were the lunatics,\" I said.\n\nThe young man nodded. \"Yes, that's his usual line. That's what got him\ncommitted in the first place. For my money, he's right but he oughtn't\nto go around saying it. And what can we do for you?\"\n\nI told him that the \"associate psychiatrist\" had advised me to put\nmyself in the hands of my family doctor and had prescribed a dose of\nwine, women and song as a method of restoring my mental balance. I was\ntroubled by serious loss of memory, I said, and needed treatment.\n\nHe nodded again. \"Boy, when I finish my internship and start private\npractice, am I going to clean up in the upper brackets with that one!\nMurdoch's crazy to waste that on these people in Phipps. They can't\nfollow his advice. This one is strictly for Park Avenue.\"\n\nI left the clinic, phoned the hotel in Washington from a pay-booth in a\ncorner drug-store, and told Germaine to join me at Pook's Hill. I said\nthat I had had to leave Washington in a hurry and would explain when I\nsaw her. I added that I'd just had a consultation at Johns Hopkins and\nhad decided to take medical treatment.\n\n\"I know one thing you don't need treatment for--your nerve!\" she\nreplied and hung up on me.\n\nWhen I reached the house in Bedford Hills, I was welcomed by\nMary-Myrtle at the front door and by the loud barking of Ponto from my\nbedroom. Germaine had not yet returned.\n\n\"How's Ponto?\" I asked the maid.\n\n\"Oh, he's fine,\" she told me, \"just fine. He eats his food and sleeps\nregular and is just like he was.\"\n\n\"Good, I'll take a look at him.\"\n\nI went upstairs and held my bedroom door ajar.\n\n\"Hullo, Ponto old boy,\" I said in the curious tone one uses towards\ndogs, children and public men. \"Here I am back from Washington.\"\n\nHe lay on my bed, with ears pricked up, gazing at me intently.\n\n\"Yes, Ponto,\" I continued. \"I got the Order of Merit from President\nTruman himself and met all the big shots, so if you take a bite at me\nnow it will be sabotage.\"\n\nPonto put his ears back and let his tongue dangle from the side of his\nmouth, while his tail made a haze as it thumped delightedly on the\npillow. If he hadn't been an animal, I would have said he was laughing.\n\n\"There, old fellow,\" I soothed him.\n\nHe wuffed affectionately, jumped to the floor, and stood beside me,\npanting and drooling.\n\n\"Thank God, you're well again, Ponto,\" I told him. \"We can't have two\nloony people in this house. Now it's my turn to go to the vet's and be\ntreated.\"\n\nPonto's answer was to lick my hand convulsively and wag his tail and\notherwise give a splendid impersonation of an affectionate \"Friend of\nMan\" whose beloved master has returned. So I took him downstairs with\nme and turned him out for a run on the lawn while I sat in my den and\ntried to get my thoughts in order.\n\nWhat worried me most was Virginia Rutherford's sudden change in\nmanner. From having been definitely the woman scorned--angry, hurt and\nhell-bent for revenge--she had adopted an air of friendly complicity\nthe moment I had left the White House. This made no sense to me.\nGermaine was unchanged but that was because she was a simple woman who\nwas in the obvious process of falling in love with her own husband.\nWhatever I did would be all right with her, which was a great comfort\nbut not much help. Then, too, I was beginning to get uneasy at the\nincreasing glibness and complexity of the lies I was telling. It was\nalmost as though I were playing a part for which at some time I had\nonce rehearsed. As Tyler had told me in the State Department, it\n_would_ be interesting to know how I happened to invent the legendary\n\"Z-2.\"\n\nThere was the crunch of gravel as an automobile slowed to a stop\noutside, the click of a key in the lock and then Germaine was in the\nden and in my arms, with all the etchings of ducks staring at her.\n\n\"Winnie,\" she exclaimed. \"You _are_ the most unexpected person. I had\nthe most awful time at the Willard after you phoned me. When I tried to\npay the bill they wouldn't take my check because my name wasn't Grant.\nIn fact, I had to telephone that nice Mrs. Jacklin before I could find\na bank that would give me the money. Then that Mr. Harcourt from the\nF.B.I. came in and talked to me for the longest time. He seemed quite\nsurprised when I told him you had gone to Johns Hopkins. Don't you feel\nwell, dear?\"\n\n\"I never felt better,\" I assured her. \"No, Jimmy, that was because\nsomebody in the Secret Service got the idea that I ought to be put in\nan asylum. It's a nasty little trick of theirs, I gather, to send a man\nto the booby-bin for life if they don't like him but have no evidence\nagainst him. So I thought I'd play it smart and beat them to the punch.\nThat's why I went to Baltimore, to get a mental check-up at the Phipps\nClinic.\"\n\n\"Did they--Are you--Are you all right?\" she faltered. \"I couldn't bear\nit if--\"\n\nI laughed and gave her a good hug. \"I'm all right,\" I told her. \"They\ndidn't have time to examine me but gave me two bits of advice. First,\nI was to get Jerry Rutherford to handle my case. I guess you need\npolitical influence now to get yourself locked up. And then, I was told\nthat I ought to have more licker and wimmin in my life. It seems I'm\ngetting in a rut.\"\n\n\"Winnie!\"\n\n\"Uh-huh! They recommended it for curing highly inhibited cases like\nmine. I'm repressed or something.\"\n\n\"It must be something,\" Germaine observed fifteen minutes later. \"Oh,\ndear, I didn't even think whether the door was locked. I'm a sight. You\ndon't act repressed to me.\"\n\nShe turned her face towards me, her eyes laughing.\n\n\"In any case, I'll have to see a doctor,\" I said, \"and it might as\nwell be Rutherford. He knows so much about me that I won't have to do a\nlot of explaining.\"\n\n\"Winnie!\"\n\nGermaine swung her feet to the floor and straightened her clothes.\n\"Winnie,\" she repeated, \"_must_ you go to a doctor? Can't we try the\n_other_ prescription--I mean, give it a _good_ try?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"No can do. I've got to get my memory straightened out. You and\nI--well, _we're_ all right now. But there's my business and then\nthere's the Secret Service. I _can't_ seem to remember a thing before\nthe second of April and I did so much lying in Washington, trying to\ncover up, that I may get into real trouble. That's what Virginia said,\nthat I'd lied myself into a worse mess than I'd lied myself out of.\"\n\nMy wife pouted. \"Don't these treatments take a long time?\" she asked.\n\"I remember when they sent Cousin Frederick to the asylum after\nthat time when he put tear-gas in the air-conditioners in the Stock\nExchange, it was three years before they let him out. Of course he\n_was_ crazy, though we pretended it was only drink. That time he tried\nto tattoo the little Masters girl--But won't they keep you locked up\nand do things to you?\"\n\n\"Hanged if I know,\" I said, \"but they can't keep me there a day longer\nthan you or I want. It isn't as though I was being committed to an\nasylum. It's just that there's a bad crack in my memory. They'll try to\nfind out what's wrong and patch it up. Perhaps I won't have to stay\nafter all.\"\n\n\"Do they let wives come and visit their husbands?\" she asked dreamily.\n\"I mean--\"\n\n\"I've never heard that the medical profession encouraged that kind of\ntherapy,\" I told her.\n\n\"Speaking of insanity,\" I continued, \"Ponto, you will be glad to know,\nis back to normal.\"\n\nShe got up and made a face at me. \"Of course,\" she remarked with\ndeliberate provocation, \"If you think more of Ponto than you do of me.\nI'm so glad, Winnie, to know that Ponto is better. He's your dog, isn't\nhe? What was wrong with him? What medicine did you give him? What did\nthe vet say--\"\n\nShe ended in a startled squeak and ran for the door.\n\n\"You beast!\" she exclaimed, turning on me, \"it _was_ locked, all the\ntime. Oh, Winnie--\"\n\nA thousand years later she said once more, \"Oh, Winnie!\"\n\nThen she laughed.\n\n\"Just the same,\" she said, \"I'm glad about Ponto. I still think I don't\nlike the way he's been acting.\"\n\nShe yawned.\n\n\"And now, sir,\" she added, \"will you please let me go to my room. I'm\n_still_ rather dirty from my trip and I ought to get a few things\nunpacked. And besides,\" she laughed again, \"I'm ravenously hungry.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" I remarked truthfully, \"but--\"\n\n\"I _know_ we're both crazy,\" she told me some time later, \"and perhaps\nthey'd better give us a double-room at the asylum. But I know that\nunless I eat something right away I'll be dead in the morning.\"\n\n\"Let's see if there's anything in the ice-box,\" I said. \"Mary's\nprobably given up dinner long ago.\"\n\n\"Her name is Myrtle,\" Germaine corrected me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 23\n\n\nDr. Rutherford's office was tastefully furnished, in the suburban\nmedical manner, to suggest a Tudor tap-room. There was, of course, a\nspotless chrome and porcelain laboratory connecting, as well as an\nequally sanitary lavatory.\n\n\"Good of you to squeeze me in, Jerry,\" I remarked to Rutherford. \"Fact\nis I need your professional opinion.\"\n\nRutherford stroked his little dab of a moustache. \"I've sent in my\napplication to the Army Medical Corps,\" he told me. \"I hoped you'd come\nto straighten out the money end.\"\n\n\"That will be taken care of any time you need it,\" I assured him. \"Miss\nBriggs at my office will have full details. I'll phone her and my\nlawyer to fix it up as soon as I get back to the house.\"\n\n\"Well, what seems to be wrong with you, old man?\" he inquired. \"War\ngetting too much for you? Got a hang-over? Need vitamins? Bowels\nregular? I must say you're got a better color and have lost weight\nsince the last time I saw you.\"\n\n\"It's nothing wrong with my body, and I _have_ lost weight,\" I\nexplained. \"It's my mind. I've had a complete loss of memory as to what\nhappened before April second. In Washington, I was lucky to avoid the\nbooby-hatch. They couldn't handle me at Hopkins, so they told me to\nconsult my family physician. I guess that means that you are elected.\"\n\n\"Family physician is good,\" Rutherford remarked with a rather\nunprofessional grin. \"But hell! I'm no psychiatrist. Of course, in\npractice around here I bump into a few psychopathic cases but I must\nsay you've never struck me as the type.\"\n\nI assured him that I was in dead earnest about this matter, that I must\nsomehow get myself certified as sane or I might be in trouble with the\ngovernment.\n\n\"Rot, my dear fellow!\" Rutherford assured me. \"You've had some kind\nof psychic trauma or shock that's resulted in temporary amnesia. That\ncould happen to anybody. You're as sane as I am.\"\n\nI asked him whether he'd be willing to sign a medical certificate to\nthat effect.\n\n\"Well,\" he replied slowly, \"that's another story. I'm not a specialist\nalong psychiatric lines. Up here I get mostly baby-cases, indigestion,\nsome alcoholism and now and then, thank God, a real honest broken leg.\nMy name on a certificate wouldn't mean much in sanity proceedings.\nI'd rather have you run over to Hartford and see Dr. Folsom at the\nSanctuary. He has the stuff and the equipment to put you through the\nstandard tests.\"\n\n\"That's okay by me, Jerry,\" I agreed, \"but I'd still like you to put\nme through a few paces so that your records will show that this is on\nthe level. If some bright boy in Washington decides to throw me in the\nasylum for making nasty faces at the Big Brass, I want to have a clean\nmedical record for use in a counter-suit for false arrest.\"\n\nRutherford stood up and looked out the window. \"I'm a hell of a poor\nchoice for a man to look into your private life, after this business\nwith Germaine and Virginia,\" he observed.\n\n\"That's why I want to keep it all in the family,\" I told him. \"Listen,\nJerry, until she came out to Pook's Hill the other day I have no\nrecollection of ever setting eyes on Virginia. Under the circumstances,\nshe's as superfluous as a bridegroom's pajamas. I faked as well as I\ncould but the plain fact is that I have no memory of her, of you, of\nJimmie or anybody around here before April 2nd. Now that's not normal,\nto put it mildly.\"\n\n\"You know, Winnie,\" the doctor remarked professionally, \"I think\nthat your quote loss of memory unquote is nothing but a defense\nmechanism. I know a bit about your affairs and they seem to have got so\ncomplicated--with three or four women on a string, business problems,\nliquor and so forth--that you simply decided subconsciously not to\nremember anything about them. Your mind's a blank as to everything you\nwant to forget.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"The trouble is, Jerry, that my mind's not blank at\nall. I remember a hell of a lot but it's all about another man.\"\n\n\"How's that again?\"\n\nSo I told him the whole story, from beginning to end, skipping only\nthe bits about the thorium bomb and Z-2 for reasons of security, and\nomitting the name of the carrier. He took notes and studied them for a\nwhile. Then he looked up at me and smiled.\n\n\"This beats anything in Freud,\" he observed. \"I still stick to\nmy off-the-cuff diagnosis that you had something that gave you a\nshock--it needn't have been anything big, you know; just a straw\nthat broke the camel's back--and then developed this loss of memory\nas a defense mechanism. And this transfer of personalities with\nJacklin--metempsychosis is the fancy word for it--is not the usual type\nof schizophrenia, but it falls into a pattern of wish-fulfillment.\n\n\"You probably don't remember it but ever since I've known you, you've\nbeen grousing about this fellow Jacklin, whom none of us have ever\nmet. It's been close to an obsession with you. I gather that you had\nsome kind of a school-boy crush on him, which he ignored, and your\nfeelings turned to hatred. You seem to have kept close track of him and\nhis doings all these years. Subconsciously you must have identified\nyourself with him. I'm just guessing now--Folsom could make a\nscientific check--but I should say that you may have developed a split\npersonality, based on envy and jealousy for this chap. Jacklin's had\nto make his own way, while you've always had plenty of money and good\nbusiness connections, especially since you got over the depression.\nHe was in uniform, serving his country, and you were a civilian,\nenriching yourself. He had separated from his wife while you were\ntangled up with a lot of women....\"\n\n\"But how did I know that Mrs. Jacklin had a mole on her left hip?\" I\nasked.\n\n\"Nine women out of ten have at least one and often more moles on both\ntheir hips,\" he said, \"as you should know. In any case, I take it that\nyou didn't verify the statement. No, Winnie, at the Sanctuary they can\ndeal with this sort of thing scientifically and tell you how to make\nthe readjustment.\"\n\n\"My wife doesn't want me to readjust too much,\" I told him. \"She'd\nrather have me crazy and stick around with her than sane but off\nchasing a bunch of skirts.\"\n\n\"Can't say that I blame her, old man,\" he agreed, controlling himself\nwith a visible effort, \"but that's her affair and nothing to do with\nyour case.\"\n\n\"Quite!\" I told him, \"and let me say that you've been a hell of a good\nsport about this mess. Believe me, Jerry, I'm not trying to alibi\nmyself so far as Virginia is involved, but I don't remember anything\nabout her and me that couldn't be taught in a Methodist Sunday School.\nIt's--it's almost as though I had been born again, given a last chance\nto relive my life. If that's what trauma does for you, we ought to have\nmore of it.\"\n\n\"Listen, Winnie,\" the doctor remarked. \"This is between us, of course,\nbut the sanest thing you ever did was to get shed of Virginia. She's\nfun and all that, but after a few weeks it's boring to live with a\none-track mind with red hair. Germaine is worth a dozen of her. Perhaps\nwhen I get back from the Army, Virginia will have settled down enough\nto be a doctor's wife. You'll see that she gets the money, won't you?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I agreed, \"and I'll give you a tip I learned at Hopkins.\nThe short-cut to medical riches. A loony psychiatrist there says he\nalways advises middle-aged men to do a little heavy drinking and woman\nchasing, in order to get rid of their inhibitions. There ought to be a\nfortune in that kind of medical treatment, especially in Westchester.\"\n\nJerry Rutherford laughed. \"Westchester's discovered the prescription\nall by itself,\" he said, \"and they're just beginning to learn that\nwhen a middle-aged American sheds his inhibitions, there's damn little\nof him left. Now, you'd better run along and get packed for a stay\nin Hartford. I'll phone Folsom and tell him you're driving over this\nafternoon. He'll fix you up if anyone can.\"\n\n\"Swell!\" I thanked him.\n\nWhen I got back to Pook's Hill, I called the office and told Arthurjean\nthat I was leaving for a rest-cure at the Hartford Sanctuary and\nto tell my partners that I didn't want to be disturbed by business\naffairs until further notice. I asked her to get hold of Merriwether\nVail and meet me at the Sanctuary as soon as they could make it.\nThey were to bring the necessary papers so that I could deed over\n$15,000 to Dr. Jeremiah Rutherford of Bedford Hills, to be paid in\nmonthly installments of $1,000 to his wife. I added that there was\nnothing seriously wrong with me but that the best advice I could get\nrecommended a rest-cure to head off a possible nervous breakdown. Then\nI said good-bye to Germaine, gave Ponto a farewell pat on the head and\npiled into my Packard for the drive to Hartford.\n\nThe Sanctuary proved to be a large, pleasant brick building--something\nabout half-way between a country club and a summer hotel--in the better\ngroomed suburbs of Hartford, with a fine view of the Connecticut River.\nThe ample grounds were surrounded by a high spiked iron fence and the\ngates to the driveway were closed, until I had identified myself to\nthe guard on duty. In fact, it reminded me of the routine of getting\nadmitted to the White House grounds, except that this time I was not\naccompanied by General Wakely. At the front door, a uniformed attendant\ntook charge of my bags and gave directions to have my car sent to the\ngarage. Then I was ushered into one of those hospital waiting-rooms\nthat defy all interior-decorating efforts to give them a respectable,\nhomelike touch.\n\nA few moments later, a pretty nurse in a white starched uniform\ndirected me to follow her. We went through a door, which she was\ncareful to lock behind her, along a corridor and up one flight of\nstairs to a pleasantly furnished bedroom, where my bags were already\nwaiting for me. She told me to get undressed and go to bed--which I\ndid, after she had carefully unpacked my belongings, removing my razor\nand my nail-file.\n\n\"Dr. Folsom will be by to see you in a few minutes, Mr. Tompkins,\" she\ninformed me. \"Just ring if you want anything.\"\n\nAfter she left, I felt good and mad. How in blazes did they expect\nto minister to a mind diseased, if they began by the old routine of\ngetting the patient stripped and bedded? Then I realized that this\nwas just a simple matter of establishing the institution's moral\nsuperiority, at the very outset, and my anger evaporated. I lay back\nand dozed for a few minutes until the door opened and a burly man, with\na glittering eye and strangler's hands, entered my room.\n\n\"I'm Dr. Folsom, Mr. Tompkins,\" he informed me. \"Dr. Rutherford phoned\nthat you were coming over for a check-up. Before we get down to\nbusiness, there are a few routine questions I'd like to ask.\"\n\nThey were routine: Name, age, address, next of kin, annual income,\nbanking connections, name of recommending physician, and whether\npatient had previously received mental treatment in an accredited\npsychiatric institution.\n\n\"Shall we mail the bills to Mrs. Tompkins?\" he asked.\n\n\"Hell, no! Give them to me. I brought along my check-book.\"\n\nDr. Folsom nodded approval. \"Here is the bill for the first week,\" he\nsaid. \"We generally ask our patients to pay in advance.\"\n\nHe handed me a folded piece of fine bonded paper. On it, tastefully\ninscribed, was the information that I owed The Sanctuary, Hartford,\nConn., $250.00 for room, board and attendance for the period of April\n20-25, inclusive. There was a space for my signature and the doctor\nthrust a fountain-pen into my hand. \"Just sign there and we'll send it\nto your bank for collection,\" he said.\n\n\"What's all this fine print?\" I suddenly demanded.\n\n\"Oh, that's just a matter of form,\" he explained.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" I urged. \"I was always taught that when in Hartford\nyou ought always to read the small print at the bottom of the page.\"\n\nI studied it out. \"The above signature,\" it read, \"constitutes an\nagreement not to leave or attempt to leave The Sanctuary without the\nprior approval of the Management.\"\n\nI looked at Dr. Folsom. \"If you don't mind, doctor,\" I told him, \"I'd\nprefer to sign one of my own checks and have it cleared in the usual\nway. What's the idea of having me sign away my liberty like that?\"\n\nFolsom smiled disarmingly. \"That's one of the ways we judge whether a\npatient is really sane. Only a crazy man would sign it,\" he explained.\n\"More seriously, Mr. Tompkins, you must remember that a private asylum\nhas quite a problem in controlling its patients. They are not generally\ncommitted to our care by court orders and usually come here only at the\nrequest of their families with their own reluctant consent. Without a\nsigned agreement of that kind, we might be exposed to legal annoyances,\nsuit for damages or even a kidnapping charge, if a patient changed his\nmind and decided to act nasty.\"\n\n\"I see your point, doctor,\" I told him. \"I've asked my attorney and my\nprivate secretary to meet me here a little later today. I have some\nbusiness I must clean up before I can settle down for treatment. I'll\nconsult him about the kind of agreement to sign with the Sanctuary.\nSo far as I'm concerned, I don't see the necessity for any agreement.\nI want to get a simple sanity test and see if you can recommend any\ncourse of treatment for dealing with a serious loss of memory.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure that it is the management's policy to accept a patient\nunder such unusual conditions,\" he said. \"I'll have to consult my\nassociates.\"\n\n\"See here, doctor,\" I replied. \"All I want now is to have one of the\npsychiatrists give me the works, tell me whether I'm sane or crazy, and\nthen I'll pull out. I don't want to stay here under false pretenses and\nI don't intend to stay here a minute longer than I want to. I'll pay\nany fee you charge, within reason, but I'm damned if I'll sign my own\nfreedom away, with Wall Street getting set to shoot the works.\"\n\nDr. Folsom laughed. \"I can't say that I blame you, Mr. Tompkins. And\nyou don't sound unbalanced to me.\"\n\n\"But I want a document signed to that effect,\" I declared. \"You see,\nsome of my business associates have been trying to have me adjudged\nincompetent so as to get control of my money. It's about three million\ndollars at present quotations. So I'm out to build up my defenses in\nadvance of the show-down. _Now_ do you understand?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" The Director of the Sanctuary was enormously relieved. \"That's no\ntrouble at all. I'll send up our business psychiatrist, Dr. Pendergast\nPotter--he studied under Jung in Vienna, you know--and he'll give you\nour standard businessman's sanity-test. We have quite a few cases like\nyours, you know. It's surprising how many business partners seize on\ninsanity as a key to robbing their associates. It's done every day. And\nour fee for this service will be five thousand dollars.\"\n\n\"Five thousand dollars it is!\" I agreed.\n\n\"Good!\" Dr. Folsom beamed. \"I'll send Potter over right away.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 24\n\n\nWhen Dr. Pendergast Potter arrived, he proved to be a short,\nsquare-built man, with a red spade beard and soft but shifty brown\neyes--like an Airedale's. He had, he told me almost at once, studied\nwith Jung in Vienna and I thought of that mischievous parody--\n\n    \"Bliss was it in that Freud to be alive,\n    But to be Jung was very Heaven!\"\n\n\"Dr. Folsom tells me, Mr. Tompkins,\" Potter continued in a sort of\nheel-clicking, stiff-bow-from-the-waist manner which was meant, I\nsuppose, to reveal his Viennese training, \"that you have reason\nto believe that your business partners are plotting against you,\nconspiring to throw you in the asylum? This sense of special\npersecution, sir, have you had it long? Perhaps when you were a child,\nyou hated your father? It began then, not so? And, later at school,\nperhaps--\"\n\nI got out of bed and advanced on the psychiatrist.\n\n\"Dr. Potter,\" I informed him, \"you are here for only one reason, to\ncertify that I am sane in the legal sense. For this service I am paying\nthe Sanctuary a fee of five thousand dollars. To which, of course, I\nwill add a personal fee of one thousand dollars to you, Dr. Potter,\nassuming that you can sign a certificate of sanity with a clear\nscientific conscience.\"\n\nPotter subsided in the arm-chair and cackled gleefully. \"Boy, oh boy!\"\nhe exclaimed, \"for one thousand smackers I'd certify that Hitler is the\nMessiah. Damn Folsom for sending me in blind! He didn't tell me it was\none of those.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" I added, \"I have a really serious loss of memory, which is\nworth your attention, though I haven't time to go into it now. So get\nahead with your tests, please, and let's clean up this one.\"\n\n\"Cross your knees, either leg!\" he ordered and gave me a few brisk\ntaps just below the knee-cap with the edge of his flattened palm. My\nknee-jerks were all that could be desired.\n\n\"Good!\" remarked Potter. \"That's still the only physical test for\nsanity that's worth a damn. Hell! They have all sorts of gadgets but\nthey all amount to the same thing: Is your nervous system functioning\nnormally or is it not? What seems to be the trouble, Mr. Tompkins?\nPartners closing in on your assets or has your wife made book with\nyour lawyer?\"\n\n\"My only trouble,\" I informed him, \"is that I'm damned if I can\nremember anything that happened before April second of this year.\nThat's been getting me close to trouble and I'd like to clear it up. I\nremember all sorts of things before then, but it's about another man.\"\n\n\"Hm!\" Potter suddenly looked formidably medical. \"That's what I call\nschizophrenia with a pretzel twist. We could keep you here and give you\nsedatives and baths and exercises and analysis, but it would be just\nthe same if we left you alone. You've had some kind of shock causing a\ntemporary occlusion of personality, and the best thing you can do is\nwait. Sooner or later there will be another shock and everything will\ncome straight again. What do you think you remember from the blank\nperiod?\"\n\n\"Damned if I know,\" I replied. \"I think I sank a battleship or killed a\nPresident, or something.\"\n\nPotter laughed. \"That's just a variation of the good old Napoleon\ncomplex--which is an inferiority complex gone wild. You ought to take\nup a hobby, like expert book-binding or watch-repairing. That would\ngive you a sense of power and you wouldn't feel the need for sinking\nships. Ten to one, you can't even shoot a decent game of golf.\"\n\n\"I'm pretty good at poker,\" I defended myself.\n\n\"That's not power, Mr. Tompkins, that's just shrewdness. You have a\nprofound sense of physical inadequacy. The record says you're married.\nAny children?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"That's it,\" Potter declared. \"We had a case like that in Jung's\nclinic--a baker named Hermann Schultz, who insisted that he was the\nEmperor Friedrich Barbarossa. We were baffled for a while, since\nSchultz was married and had three children. Then we learned that his\nwife was the girl-friend of one of the Habsburg Archdukes and that\npoor Schultz was not the father of little Franz, Irma and Ernst. We\nsolved it for him with his wife's help. She agreed to have another\nchild. Of course, it was the Archduke's but Schultz never guessed.\nHe ceased to believe that he was the Barbarossa and became a highly\nsuccessful baker. What you ought to do, Mr. Tompkins, is to father a\nchild and then you will forget all this nonsense about battleships and\nPresidents. Not so?\"\n\nI grinned at him knowingly. \"There's much in what you say, Dr. Potter,\"\nI complimented him, \"but what the hell can I do about it bottled up\nhere in the Sanctuary? Just give me a clean mental bill of health--in\ncase any of my partners try to pull a fast one--and I'll go home to my\nwife and give earnest consideration to your suggestion. After all, if\nthat fails, I can always take up wood-carving. Or try another girl.\"\n\n\"There are one or two around here--\" he began, then checked himself.\n\"Well,\" he continued, \"I can't say that I see anything really abnormal\nabout you. Sitting here, talking with you, I would have noticed any\npsychopathic tendencies. We psychiatrists develop a sort of sixth sense\nfor the abnormal. I couldn't prove it scientifically, but I am sure as\nAdam ate little green apples that there's nothing wrong with you that\ncan't be cured by a drink, a kiss and a baby.\"\n\nThere was a brisk knock on the door and the nurse appeared.\n\n\"Sorry to disturb you, doctor,\" she said, \"but there's a man named Vail\ndownstairs with a writ of habeas corpus for Mr. Tompkins.\"\n\nPotter looked at me accusingly, as though Jung had never for-seen this\nkind of complication.\n\n\"Merry Vail,\" I agreed. \"Yes, he's my lawyer. I told him to come here\nbut never dreamed--just send him up, nurse. In the meanwhile, doctor,\nif you could get that certificate ready--\"\n\nPotter again gave the effect of heel-clicking, and withdrew.\n\nThree minutes later Merriwether Vail and Arthurjean Briggs came\nbursting into my room.\n\n\"Glory be, you're still safe, old man,\" my lawyer announced. \"When Miss\nBriggs phoned me your curious message, we put two and two together.\"\n\n\"And made it twenty-two?\" I suggested.\n\n\"No, we made it four. We weren't going to stand for any nonsense from\nthe F.B.I. and I owe them something for pulling me in for questioning.\nAnd when you spoke of fifteen thousand dollars and a doctor, I had a\nbrain-storm. So I flew up here and swore out a writ from the Federal\nCourt. I got a deputy to help me serve it--cost me all of twenty\nbucks--and here we are.\"\n\nI turned to Arthurjean. \"Honeychile,\" I asked, \"did you by any chance,\nthink to bring me some of the office brandy? I've been moving so fast\nfor the last three days that I'm out of training.\"\n\nMy secretary turned her back, gave a sort of dip-dive-and-wiggle and\nproduced from God knows where a half pint bottle of what proved to be\nexcellent brandy, well-warmed above room temperature. I heartlessly\nrefused to notice Vail's pathetic signs of desperate thirst and passed\nthe flask back to Arthurjean. \"Thanks,\" I told her, \"that just about\nsaved my life.\"\n\n\"Mr. Vail was all set that the doctors had hijacked you and were\nholding you for ransom,\" she remarked, taking a short but deep drink\nherself. \"Seems like there's been a mistake.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh!\" I indicated strong disagreement. \"I came here under my own\npower and am about to leave under the same and in my right mind.\"\n\n\"Whoever said you weren't?\" Vail demanded. \"God! we'll sue them for\nlibel.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"It was the Secret Service and only God can sue them,\"\nI said. \"They took a notion to have me thrown in the Washington asylum\nbecause they were sore at me on general principles. So I decided to\nbeat them to the draw and produce a certificate of sanity.\"\n\nVail looked at me with amusement. \"Worst thing you could possibly\ndo, old man,\" he informed me. \"If you start going around showing\npeople proof that you're not crazy, first thing you know you'll be in\nMatteawan. Now if you want to prove to anybody that you're really in\nyour right mind, you'll try to do the right thing by this little girl\nhere.\"\n\nIn some bewilderment I looked at Arthurjean, whom nobody could\naccurately accuse of being little.\n\n\"What are you driving at, Merry?\" I asked.\n\n\"I refer to my client, Miss Briggs,\" he replied with dignity. \"We have\nstrong written evidence of breach of promise.\"\n\n\"Sugar-puss?\" I turned to my secretary, \"Don't tell me that you've\nshown my letters to this legal lout?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Sorry, angel, but a girl's got to take care of herself in\nthis world. You remember where you wrote me, 'Be but mine and I shall\nbuy you a porterhouse steak with mushrooms'.\"\n\n\"It was onions, darling,\" I insisted. \"Onions aren't breach of promise.\nDamn it! they're cause for divorce.\"\n\n\"It was mushrooms,\" she repeated. \"That was the same letter in which\nyou promised me hearts of lettuce, and ice-cream and--\" she broke down,\nsobbing with laughter.\n\nI pulled her face down to me and gave her a kiss. \"You big slob,\" I\ntold her, \"all you think about, with democracy at the crossroads, is\nfood. Take that shyster downstairs and wait for me. I'll be down as\nsoon as I collect my certificate. Even if I can't wear it on my coat\nlike a campaign-ribbon it will be nice to hang in my den alongside my\nHarvard B.A. diploma and the moose I didn't kill--it was the Indian\nguide but they don't count--in New Brunswick.\"\n\nArthurjean laughed. \"You sure do make your help sing for their supper,\nangel,\" she told me. \"And just because I call you angel don't you start\nworrying about that nice wife of yours. From now on, I'll make like a\nsister.\"\n\nSo I smacked her on the porte-cochere and ordered her out of the room\nuntil I got dressed. As the door closed behind her and Vail, I rang for\nthe nurse and asked to have my bags packed.\n\n\"Goodness, Mr. Tompkins,\" she exclaimed. \"Don't you like it here? We\nunderstood that you wanted a rest-cure.\"\n\nShe stood just a fraction of an inch too close to me and I was aware of\npretty brown hair under her starched nurse's cap, a whiff of something\nthat smelled far more expensive than antiseptic, and a pleasingly\nrounded effect underneath the prim blouse of her uniform. So I put my\narm around her, gave her a friendly kiss and said, \"Name, please, and\nwhen do you get off duty?\"\n\n\"Emily Post,\" she answered, \"so help me, but don't let that stop you,\nand nine o'clock tonight.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I told her. \"Will you join us for dinner and a drink at--what's\nthe best hotel here now we've a war on?\"\n\n\"The Governor Baldwin,\" she replied.\n\n\"Meet us at the Baldwin, then, as soon as you can get away. I'd like\nyou to meet my friends socially and--\"\n\nShe nodded brightly and hurried from the room, with a distinctly\nunmedical motion of her hips.\n\nA moment later Dr. Folsom came lounging in, his strangler's hands\ndangling at his side.\n\n\"Sorry you feel you must leave, Mr. Tompkins,\" he told me. \"Here's that\ncertificate. It will stand up in any court east of the Mississippi if\nyou have to use it. That will be five thousand, as agreed.\"\n\nI sat down at the little writing-desk and laboriously made out three\nchecks: one for five thousand to the order of the Sanctuary, one for\none thousand to the order of Pendergast Potter, and another for one\nthousand to the order of--\n\n\"Any initials, Dr. Folsom?\" I asked.\n\n\"A. J.,\" he replied, \"but just make it to the Sanctuary.\"\n\n\"A. J. Folsom,\" I wrote on the final check and endorsed it with \"W. S.\nTompkins,\" as well as I could with my still bandaged fingers.\n\n\"What--\" Folsom was startled. \"Gosh! You're a white man, Mr. Tompkins.\nAnd Potter will be glad to have this, too. He is--\"\n\n\"Think nothing of it!\" I announced grandly. \"The market's been working\nfor me all week, and this won't even cost you income-tax; I'll put it\ndown as a gift.\"\n\nFolsom's face was positively transfigured with gratitude and a devotion\nthat would not have been out of place in a stained glass window.\n\n\"By George!\" he insisted. \"You _are_ a white man. I'd be proud to go\nbefore the Supreme Court of the United States and testify--\" He stopped\nabruptly. \"Are these checks good?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Oh, come, doctor, who's loony now?\" I demanded. \"Why would I expose\nmyself to a bad check charge just to keep out of a private asylum with\nmy lawyer fully equipped with a writ?\"\n\n\"That's so, that's so!\" he beamed reassured. \"Well, sir, it's been fine\nhaving you here and any time--day or night--if you want refuge from the\nstormy blast, just come out to the Sanctuary. We'll always be honored\nto put you up and give you the best we have for as long as you care to\nstay. Believe me, Mr. Tompkins, it may seem odd but you'll never find\nwarmer hospitality or a more sincere welcome than right here in this\nlittle old asylum.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 25\n\n\nThe grill in the Governor Baldwin was not crowded and we had no trouble\ngetting a pleasant table in the corner, while four colored men blew\ninto metal objects, hit things and delivered themselves of various\nrhythmic noises. From time to time they paused, in order to allow the\nperspiring couples who jiggled and writhed on the dancefloor time to\ncool off. While waiting for Emily Post to appear, Arthurjean was very\nsubordinate, calling me \"Mr. Tompkins\" and acting, quite as the boss's\nsecretary should act when out for dinner with the boss. Merry Vail was\nin high spirits and insisted on having the deputy who had helped serve\nthe writ join us for a drink. But the deputy was a pallid young man\nwith--he told us--a heart-murmur that kept him out of the armed forces\nand he never touched anything strong.\n\nSo we shed him ahead of the time when the nurse from \"The Sanctuary\"\nshowed up in a slick dancing-dress that seemed painted on her torso\nand a make-up that was a tribute to the skill of the advertisers of\ncosmetics. Vail took one look at her and his face lit up like Broadway.\n\n\"Spring is in the air,\" he remarked to the world at large. \"Will you\ndance, Miss Post?\"\n\nShe flashed a smile that promised some and hinted at more, and said,\n\"You bet!\"\n\nI watched them as they took the dance floor and the music took them. I\nturned back to my secretary.\n\n\"What gives, angel?\" I asked.\n\nShe beamed at me. \"Winnie,\" she observed, \"you're _it_. Perhaps the\nmost famous man in Wall Street, in a quiet way. You caught the market\njust right. Mr. Wasson and Mr. Cone pulled out just right, before the\nbig operators decided they must be patriotic and support quotations\nbefore you made too much money. We've cleaned up nearly three million\ndollars and Mr. Cone's so happy about it he's got him a brand-new\ngirl-friend.\"\n\n\"How about Wasson?\" I asked. \"Has success gone to his head?\"\n\n\"Oh, he's just the same as ever. He didn't bat an eyelash except to\nsay that you were one wise so-and-so to figure the break.\"\n\n\"And how about yourself, Arthurjean?\"\n\nShe grinned at me. \"I guess a girl can tell when she's washed up with\na swell guy. But you're not Winnie--not the Winnie I knew--and there\naren't going to be any fun and games from now on, I guess.\"\n\nShe took a hearty pull at her highball.\n\n\"So we're friends,\" she announced. \"You've got a swell wife waiting for\nyou. If you ever need me, I'll be around. If you don't, that's okay\ntoo. But Gawd, honeychile, we did have us some fun--Winnie and I. He\nhad a theory that monogamy was a kind of hardwood that grows in the\ntropics, and that made him kind of nice to play with. What gives with\nyou?\"\n\nI gave her a fill-in on the Washington trip and the events that had\nbrought me to The Sanctuary, and she listened with a growing smile.\n\n\"Why--\" she began, but the music stopped, and Vail and Miss Post\nreturned to the table.\n\n\"Winnie,\" Vail announced, \"spring hath come to Hartford, Conn., and\nI've decided to take a room at this hotel. This is a mighty fine little\ncity, isn't it? Clean, vital, New England honesty and all that, not to\nmention insurance. And--\" His eyes strayed fondly in the direction of\nthe nurse who sat with eyes demurely downcast.\n\n\"Okay,\" I told him. \"This is the official opening of spring. Just give\nme those papers I wanted to sign. The money for Dr. Rutherford, I mean.\"\n\nHe stared at me.\n\n\"You don't mean to say you were serious about that!\" he exclaimed. \"I\nthought it was a gag to tip me off that you were being railroaded to\nthe asylum. Hell, I'll have the stuff drawn up and you can sign it on\nMonday. There's nothing doing in town over the week-end and Rutherford\ncan wait. If you like, I'll try to beat him down. For my money, he'll\nsettle for five thousand and to hell with his family honor.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No dice, Merry. It's fifteen thousand--a gentleman's\nagreement.\"\n\n\"Hell! no gentleman has any business making agreements. That's what\nlawyers are for.\"\n\nThe music started up with a rather miscegenated attempt to marry\nMendelssohn's Spring Song to \"Pistol-Packing Momma.\" He grabbed Emily\nPost by the arm. \"Come on,\" he urged. \"Got to dance. I'll show you some\nsteps that aren't in the book of etiquette.\"\n\n\"Why, Mr. Vail!\" she agreed, and they were off again.\n\nI resumed my talk with Arthurjean. \"You'd better stay here, too,\" I\ntold her. \"It's getting late and they lock up the trains on the New\nHaven road along with the cows.\"\n\nShe looked the question at me.\n\n\"Nope!\" I replied sturdily. \"I'm going to drive back and see whether\nspring has come to Bedford Hills. Even commuters have children now and\nthen,\" I added. \"They used to blame it on sunspots or Roosevelt but\nnow I guess they'll have nobody to blame but themselves.\"\n\nIn return for a five-spot the hotel door-man told me how to find the\nnearest Black Market gas-station, so I tanked up the Packard and worked\nmyself across country until I hit the Parkway.\n\nThe night was clear and cool but there was a hint of blossoms in the\nair.\n\nVail was right. Spring had come to the commuters and I thought\nsardonically of what could be expected at every country club the next\nnight--Saturday. I missed the turn-off for Bedford Hills and wasted\na couple of hours wandering amiss through the maze of Westchester\nroads, but finally I found myself on a familiar road and soon eased\nthe Packard to a slow stop on the crackling gravel of the entrance of\nPook's Hill.\n\nI left my bags in the car and walked quietly along the grass until I\nlet myself in at front door. A muffled woof from the kitchen showed\nthat Ponto had drowsily recognized my tread as I tip-toed up the\nstairs and into my bedroom. It was three o'clock in the morning and\nthe frogs were still jingling in the marshy meadows as I stood by the\nwindow and tasted the night air. Then I undressed rapidly and put on a\ndressing-gown and slippers. I turned off the lights and tip-toed across\nthe hall to my wife's bedroom.\n\nHer door was closed but, when I turned the handle, it proved not to\nbe locked or bolted. I closed it softly behind me and approached the\nedge of the bed. Germaine was sleeping quietly, the faint glow of the\nstarlight outlining her dark hair against the white pillow.\n\nSuddenly she started.\n\n\"What? Who's that?\" she cried.\n\nI leaned over and brushed her hair with my lips.\n\n\"It's me,\" I told her truthfully. \"Everything's all right.\"\n\n\"Hurry!\" she murmured. \"You'll catch cold.\"\n\nA moment later, she remarked conversationally, \"Heavens! You _are_\ncold.\"\n\nThen she burrowed herself against me and wordlessly raised her lips to\nmine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I opened my eyes in the morning the bed felt strangely deserted. I\nreached over and found that I was alone.\n\n\"Jimmie!\" I called. \"Jimmie!\"\n\nShe appeared at the bathroom door.\n\n\"Hullo,\" she remarked. \"Where did you come from? And what are you doing\nthere? Don't you know that all respectable married couples sleep in\nseparate rooms, according to 'House and Garden'?\"\n\n\"I'm not respectable,\" I told her. \"Please notify the editor.\"\n\n\"You certainly are not!\" she observed. \"You nearly gave me\nheart-failure, sneaking into my room like that when you were supposed\nto be in Hartford. It would have served you right if I'd called for the\npolice.\"\n\n\"I'm just as good as the average policeman,\" I suggested. \"Come over\nhere and I'll show you how we Tompkinses--\"\n\nBut she evaded me.\n\n\"No, sir. We must set a good example to the servants. It's way past\nbreakfast time and I don't want Myrtle to guess that we're absolutely\nshameless.\"\n\nBreakfast was waiting for us when we came downstairs and we gave\na reasonably good impersonation of an elderly married couple at\nthe breakfast table. I read the financial section of the \"Times\"\nand Germaine again busied herself with the social page of the\n\"Herald-Tribune\", now and then reading brief items about marriages, and\ndivorces, while I grunted noncommitally about the state of the market.\nAs a matter of fact, we both believed we had succeeded admirably when\nour attention was attracted by a meaning kind of cough.\n\nIt was Mary-Myrtle.\n\n\"What is it, Myrtle?\" Germaine asked with a radiant smile.\n\n\"It's not my business to say so,\" the maid stammered, \"but I wanted to\nknow whether you would really keep me on. I--I like it here--and I'm so\nglad you're happy, Mrs. Tompkins.\"\n\n\"Of course, you're going to stay with us, Myrtle, but however did you\nguess?\"\n\n\"You can see it in your face, Mrs. Tompkins,\" she said, \"and Mr.\nTompkins he was looking at the sporting page and talking about U.S.\nSteel and A.T.&T. And--oh, it's nice.\"\n\nAnd she fled from the room.\n\nGermaine looked at me like the angel at the Gates of Eden. \"There!\"\nshe exclaimed. \"That's what happens when I trust you. You can't even\nfind the right page in the paper to fake from. Next time I'm going to\nmarry a man who doesn't look so damned happy it's a give-away.\"\n\n\"It's spring,\" I explained stupidly.\n\n\"You know, Winnie,\" my wife said suddenly, \"speaking of spring, I've\nbeen thinking about Ponto. You've had him for five years now and I\nthink he's getting a little queer. Don't you think it would be a good\nidea to send him to the kennels and have him bred? Perhaps that's all\nthat's been wrong with him.\"\n\n\"Spoken like a woman, Jimmie,\" I said, \"but I agree that it wouldn't do\nany harm. I'll phone Dalrymple after breakfast and have him send over\nfor Ponto's Sacre du Printemps. He's got championship blood and, unlike\nholy matrimony, there's money in it.\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders unspeakably.\n\n\"Poor Winnie!\" she mocked. \"You'd be worth millions if you'd been paid,\nlike Ponto.\"\n\n\"It mightn't be a bad idea, at that,\" I remarked. \"If you realize the\nyears of apprenticeship and training, the high degree of professional\nskill required--\"\n\n\"Come here, then,\" she ordered, \"I'll pay you.\"\n\nShe did.\n\n\"You won't forget about Ponto,\" she added breathless after her kiss.\n\"The poor darling oughtn't to be celibate in this household. I wouldn't\nwant it to happen to a dog.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 26\n\n\nOn the morning of Monday, April 23rd (the date seemed unimportant\nat the time), I took the early morning train into New York. Spring\nhad done its fell work and the club car was full of middle-aged\nbusiness-men, with dark circles under their eyes, prepared to fight\nat the drop of a hat anyone who said they weren't as young as they\nfelt. With Jimmie's perfume still in my nostrils, I hadn't the heart\nto deride them, so I did the next best thing and talked them into a\npoker-game.\n\nBy the time we pulled into Grand Central I was eighteen dollars and\nseventy cents ahead, thanks to a full-house just before we reached\n125th Street.\n\nInstead of joining my fellow-brokers in their Gadarene rush for the\ndowntown subway express, I strolled north along Park Avenue to the Pond\nClub.\n\nAt the Pond Club I found Tammy engaged, as ever, in polishing the\nglasses behind his gleaming little bar.\n\n\"My! Mr. Tompkins,\" he exclaimed. \"You look as though you'd just made a\nmillion dollars,\" he told me. \"The usual, sir?\"\n\n\"It was nearly three millions, Tammy, and accept no substitutes. What I\nneed is concentrated protein. How about a couple of dozen Cotuits and\nsome black coffee?\"\n\nThe steward raised his eyebrows knowingly.\n\n\"I'll mix you one of my Second Day Specials, sir,\" he said. \"Funny\nthing about that drink. One night, young Mr. Ferguson--he's a new\nmember, sir--was feeling merry and felt a sudden sense of compassion\nfor the statue of Civic Virtue in front of the City Hall. Of course,\nI've never seen it but they tell me that it's a very fine work of art,\nby a person named Mac Monnies, I believe. He wasn't a member of the\nclub, of course, but that's what I understand the name to be. So Mr.\nFerguson would have nothing for it but to take one of my Second Day\nSpecials down to the Civic Virtue and give him a drink. It seemed that\nMr. Ferguson felt quite sorry for the statue down there in front of\nLaGuardia without any company. So he took a cab downtown and poured the\ndrink down the mouth of the statue for a joke, like. But here's the odd\nthing, sir. They had to throw a canvas over the statue and send for a\nman with a hacksaw before the Mayor decided it was proper to expose it\nto the citizens again.\"\n\n\"Then bring me a double Second Day Special, without cold chisels or\nhacksaws, if you please,\" I ordered.\n\nHe smirked knowingly but had the tact of good club servants to say\nnothing. I sipped his concoction, which tasted entirely unlike the\negg-nog it outwardly resembled. A moment later, I tried another sip. It\nwas not at all unpleasant, so I drained the glass. This, I decided, was\nexactly what I needed, so I drank the second one without drawing breath.\n\n\"Ah-h-h!\" I beamed. \"That is much better. Now if anybody phones me, say\nI'm not here, unless it's one of my friends.\"\n\n\"Would that be true of that Mrs. R., sir?\" he inquired. \"That lady with\nthe red hair you told me about, Mr. Tompkins?\"\n\n\"If Mrs. Rutherford calls,\" I said, \"let me know.\"\n\nHe smiled slyly. \"Then I was to deliver a message to you from her, sir.\nShe wants you to call her at the apartment, she said. Circle 8-7326,\nthe number is. She said it was important.\"\n\nI dialed the number. Virginia answered.\n\n\"Winnie?\" Her voice was cool and amused. \"You'd better come up here in\na hurry. It's urgent.\"\n\n\"Where is here?\" I asked.\n\n\"At our place, the apartment,\" she said.\n\n\"Better give me the address,\" I suggested. \"I can't seem to remember.\"\n\n\"Winnie, that particular joke is getting tiresome. You know perfectly\nwell it's 172 East 72nd Street and the third floor front. The name,\nnaturally, is Smith.\"\n\n\"John Smith?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Natch! And hurry, unless you want to be in worse trouble than you can\nimagine.\"\n\nI signaled to Tammy. \"One more Second Day Special, please.\"\n\nHe looked worried. \"Are you quite sure, sir,\" he demurred. \"Two is as\nmuch as I've ever seen a man take.\"\n\nHe returned to his mystery and produced the fatal brew. I drank it\nslowly. By Godfrey! this was more like it. I tossed him a five-dollar\nbill.\n\n\"Just remember that you haven't seen me,\" I told him.\n\n\"Quite, Mr. Tompkins.\"\n\nI managed to snag an uptown taxi and rolled in comfort to 172 East 72nd\nStreet.\n\nI pressed the button marked Smith and was rewarded by a clicking of the\nlatch. I climbed the stairs and on the third story tapped the little\nbrass knocker. The door opened and Virginia appeared clad somewhat in a\nwhite silk dressing-gown and with her red hair sizzling out at me.\n\n\"Come in, stranger,\" she said.\n\nShe closed the door and settled herself comfortably, with a cigarette,\non the suspiciously broad day-bed. I sat down in a very deep easy\nchair, facing her, and lighted a cigarette too.\n\n\"Well?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Winnie,\" she began, \"you know I never try to interfere with your\nprivate life or try to ask questions, but don't you think this farce\nhas gone on long enough?\"\n\nI flicked some ash on the carpet and tried to look inscrutable.\n\n\"You know what you are doing, of course,\" she continued, \"and your\nperformance in Washington was magnificent, but just between ourselves,\ncan't you relax?\"\n\nAlthough the windows were open, the room seemed oppressively warm. I\nthrew back my coat and confronted her without speaking.\n\n\"Of course,\" Virginia continued, \"I know we've got to be discreet.\nThere can always be dictaphones and detectives and it seems that the\nF.B.I. knows all about this place, but can't you just--\"\n\nShe jumped up and faced me. With an angry movement, she snatched off\nher dressing-gown and flung it on the floor.\n\n\"There!\" she said. \"Is there anything _wrong_ with me? Am I repulsive?\nOr don't you care?\"\n\nIt must have been the three specials that lifted me from the easy chair\nand whisked me across the room to the embattled red head, but it must\nhave been my guardian angel that prompted my next move. I pulled out my\nfountain pen and wrote rapidly on the back of an envelope: \"I suspect\nthat we are watched.\"\n\nHer eyes widened and she quickly grabbed her gown and draped it around\nher. I laid my finger to my lips.\n\n\"What I came to see you about, Virginia,\" I said, \"is to tell you, once\nand for all, that all is over between us.\"\n\nThat was a mistake. She gave me a wink, dropped the gown and came and\nsat beside me on the arm of the chair.\n\n\"I too, Winfred,\" she said dramatically, \"have become increasingly\ndistressed by your apparent coldness.\"\n\nShe cuddled down and planted her lips on my ear while her tongue\nflicked like a little snake's.\n\n\"No,\" she continued, \"the time has come, Winfred, when we must face\nthe facts, unpleasant though they may be. I was never meant to be a\npart-time girl for any man.\"\n\nHer sharp little teeth nipped my neck savagely.\n\n\"Virginia,\" I said, \"what I had to say--what I mean is--\"\n\nI never said it. Her mouth was suddenly glued to mine and she melted\ninto my arms.\n\n\"Damn you!\" I told her. \"There.\"\n\nThe apartment door-bell was buzzing like an accusation.\n\n\"Tell them to go away,\" she murmured. \"Say we're not at home.\"\n\nI disentangled myself, ran to the door and jiggled the button that\nreleased the downstairs catch. \"Go and make yourself decent,\" I told\nher. \"I'll stall them if you aren't too long.\"\n\nI listened as the footsteps slowly mounted the stairs. It was a man's\nstep. Then came a brisk tap on the brass knocker. I opened up. It was\nA. J. Harcourt of the F.B.I. He seemed rather surprised to see me.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Tompkins,\" he began. \"I thought that--\"\n\n\"Oh, come on in,\" I urged him. \"Mrs. Rutherford will be out in a\nmoment. I--we....\"\n\nHe nodded. \"You certainly do get around,\" he admitted. \"Last the Bureau\nheard you were a patient up in Hartford, and here I find you in--\"\n\n\"In a love-nest,\" I suggested. \"A den of perfumed sin. A high-priced\nhell-hole. I got here about ten minutes ago. Mrs. Rutherford said that\nI might be in trouble but she didn't get around to explaining what\ntrouble.\"\n\nHe grinned. \"When a girl speaks of trouble, she means herself,\" he\norated.\n\n\"Oh, is that so?\"\n\nVirginia appeared at the entrance to the bathroom, completely though\nrevealingly clad, and advanced into the room brandishing her sex like\nan invisible shillelagh. \"And what has the F.B.I. to do with me, Mr.\nHarcourt?\" she demanded.\n\nPoor Harcourt looked abashed but made a speedy recovery, getting out of\nthe rough in one stroke.\n\n\"Now that Mr. Tompkins is here, Mrs. Rutherford, mam,\" he said, \"I have\nnothing to see you about. We heard he had gone to a private asylum in\nNew England and I was told to see you and ask if you knew any of the\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Virginia sat down on the rumpled day-bed. \"That sounds rather\nlike a lie, you know.\"\n\n\"That's not my fault, mam,\" Harcourt replied. \"My chief gives me my\norders and I follow them without being asked for my opinion. If the\nBureau wants to check on Mr. Tompkins through his friends--\"\n\nVirginia beamed and dimpled. \"You couldn't do better than come to me,\"\nshe admitted.\n\n\"Well, here I am,\" I told him, \"and Mrs. Rutherford needn't feel\nbothered. What is it now?\"\n\n\"We just wanted to get the rights of your run-in with the Secret\nService,\" he told me. \"Our liaison there told the Director that you\nstood Chief Flynn on his ear and that Flynn threatened to swear out a\nlunacy warrant against you. How come?\"\n\nI gave him a full account of my encounter with the Secret Service and\nended by producing the certificate of sanity signed by Dr. Folsom.\n\n\"There it is,\" I declaimed.\n\nThe Special Agent smiled. \"You're nothing if not thorough, Mr.\nTompkins. Have you had any luck filling in that blank period before\nEaster? The Bureau would feel much happier if you could remember. Now\ndon't get me wrong. The case against you is closed. You're off our\nbooks. We believe that you're telling the truth, but just the same it\nseems funny you can't remember.\"\n\nVirginia Rutherford turned on him, like a battleship bringing a battery\nof 16-inch guns to bear on a freighter. \"Perhaps he has a good reason\nfor not remembering,\" she remarked. \"Perhaps he went somewhere, with\nsome one--in skirts!\"\n\n\"That's just what puzzles us,\" Harcourt admitted. \"We've had fifty\nagents from the New York office alone making checks, as far north as\nMontreal, in Portland, Boston, Providence, and even Cincinnati and\nRichmond. We've checked trains, buses, airlines and the garages, as\nwell as the hotels, boarding-houses and overnight cabins. There isn't\nanybody that can remember seeing Mr. Tompkins, with or without a woman,\nduring that week.\"\n\n\"Then you're still investigating me?\" I asked, while a chill went down\nmy spine.\n\nThe Special Agent shook his head. \"Not at all, Mr. Tompkins. Like\nI told you, the investigation was called off last week, when we\nestablished your Z-2 identity. This is just the result of the inquiries\nwe started the week before last.\"\n\n\"And you can't find a trace?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not a thing,\" he said.\n\nMrs. Rutherford turned to me, flung her arms around me and planted a\nfar from sisterly kiss on my lips. \"Winnie, old dear,\" she observed,\n\"you are simply incredible.\"\n\nAnd she left the apartment.\n\n\"Wonder what she meant by that?\" Harcourt mused.\n\n\"We're probably happier in ignorance,\" I told him. \"Come on, A. J.,\nI'll buy a taxi down town. I've got to stop in at my office and gather\nsome of my unearned income. They tell me we've made nearly three\nmillion dollars in the last ten days.\"\n\nHarcourt consulted his note book. \"The Bureau's figures put it at\ntwo million eight hundred seventy thousand and two hundred forty-six\ndollars and seventy-one cents, if you want to know,\" he said.\n\n\"So you _are_ keeping me watched,\" I remarked.\n\n\"What do _you_ think?\" asked Special Agent Harcourt of the F.B.I.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 27\n\n\n\"What's the big idea?\" I demanded. \"I thought I was in the clear.\"\n\nHarcourt looked somewhat embarrassed.\n\n\"Perhaps I oughtn't to tell you this, Mr. Tompkins,\" he explained, \"but\nlike you said, you're in the clear with the Bureau. We've checked and\ndouble-checked and any way we slice it, you're still okay. Maybe you're\nTompkins with a lapse of memory, maybe this yarn of yours about Jacklin\nis on the level, but we're sure of _you_.\"\n\n\"Then why all this interest in me?\" I asked. \"You've been swell with\nme personally, but it's getting on my nerves having you pop up all the\ntime. Though I must say I was relieved when you showed up today. Mrs.\nRutherford--\"\n\nHe grinned. \"Red heads spell trouble anywhere, any time,\" he observed.\n\"No, it's this Von Bieberstein we're gunning for. Mr. Lamb at the\nBureau has a notion that Von Bieberstein may have some connection\nwith you that you don't know about. He might be using your office as\na post-box or be somebody that you know as someone else. It sounds\nscrewy, I know, but this Von Bieberstein is a slick baby. For all I\nknow, he might even be a woman.\"\n\nI glanced inquiringly in the direction of Virginia's apartment.\n\n\"Not for my money,\" he said. \"We've checked her, too. And it isn't that\nTennessee secretary of yours, either. There's a girl for you. We've got\nher biog right back to the Knoxville doc that delivered her. But the\nBureau doesn't think it's an accident that you turned up in the middle\nof this case, so I've been told off to check on all your contacts.\nSeems mighty funny, you a millionaire and me an average guy even if\nArthurjean still thinks I got a wife in Brooklyn, but it's the war, I\nguess.\"\n\n\"'Says every moron, There's a war on!'\" I quoted. I scratched my head.\n\"If only I could remember that blank spot, I might be able to help you.\"\n\nHarcourt studied his finger-nails attentively. \"We're taking care of\nyour office contacts, of course, and we have a couple of men working\nup in Bedford Hills. But New York's the hell of a big town and almost\nanything could happen to you outside of your office and your clubs. Got\nany ideas?\"\n\n\"What sort?\"\n\n\"Well, there's always women but I guess we've carried that line as far\nas it will take us. We've checked the doctors and the dentists and the\nbars and the nightclubs. How about astrologers, say? Hitler made use of\nthem in Germany. He might use 'em over here, though we've screened 'em\nall since before Pearl Harbor.\"\n\nI laughed. \"I doubt that a man like Tompkins would use astrology,\" I\ntold him.\n\nHarcourt shook his head. \"That's where you'd be wrong. You'd be\nsurprised how many big Wall Street operators go for that guff.\"\n\n\"It doesn't register,\" I replied, \"but I'll phone the office and see if\nMiss Briggs knows.\"\n\nWhen I made the connection, Arthurjean informed me that the phone had\nbeen ringing all morning and when would I be in. Vail, she reported,\nwas still in Hartford with a bad case of Emily Post. I asked her about\nastrologers and she said she didn't know but would find out. In a\nlittle while she reported that Phil Cone thought I'd once gone to see\nthat Ernestina Clump that used to advise the Morgan partners.\n\n\"Okay,\" I told her. \"I'll be in about four this afternoon and will\nhandle any calls or visitors then.\"\n\nI turned to Harcourt. \"It doesn't sound like much but Phil Cone thinks\nI once consulted Ernestina Clump. Want me to make an appointment?\"\n\nHe nodded, so I looked up her number and dialed the office in the\nChrysler Building where Miss Clump kept track of the stars in their\ncourses and the millionaires in their jitters.\n\nArranging for an immediate appointment through the very, very\nwell-bred secretarial voice that stiff-armed me was not easy until\nI said that I would pay double-fees. Then she believed it might be\narranged. \"That will be two thousand dollars,\" she imparted, \"and you\nmust be here at one o'clock precisely.\"\n\nAs we taxied downtown together, Harcourt was uncommunicative, except\nfor the remark that it was right handy to Grand Central and would be no\ntrick to stop off before catching trains.\n\nMiss Clump, as it turned out, was a motherly woman whose wrinkled\ncheeks and plump hands suggested greater familiarity with the\ncook-stove than with the planets. Her office showed the most refined\nkind of charlatanry--everything quite solid and in good taste, with no\ntaint of the Zodiac. At a guess, about ten thousand dollar's worth of\nfurnishings was involved and I imagined that the annual rental might\nrun as high as six thousand.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Tompkins,\" Miss Clump remarked in a pleasant, homey voice\nwith a trace of Mid-Western flatness, \"I wondered when you would be in\nto see me again. The stars being mean to you? Or is it another woman?\"\n\n\"Let's see,\" I stalled, \"when was the last time I consulted you?\"\n\nShe cackled. \"Young man, you've been comin' to see me, off and on, the\nlast ten years. Last time was in March. That was about the red-head.\nVirgo in the House of Scorpio you called it.\"\n\nI nodded. \"That would be it, I guess. She's more scorpion than virgin.\"\n\nShe patted my hand comfortingly across the table. \"They all are,\" she\nsaid, \"unless they're really in love. Then even the stars can't stop\n'em. What's the matter now?\"\n\n\"Police,\" I said. \"Loss of memory. Women and money are all right but\nI'm being followed and I've drawn sort of blank for the whole month of\nMarch. Can you take a look at my horoscope and tell me what the stars\nwere doing to me then?\"\n\nShe stared at me shrewdly. \"Police,\" she remarked. \"Land's sakes, I\ndon't want trouble with the police. Young man, you--\"\n\nI hastened to interrupt her. \"That's only a figure of speech. I'm in\ntrouble with the government. Just tell me what I was doing in March and\ngive me a hint of what lies ahead next month.\"\n\nShe examined the chart carefully and made a few pencilled notes on a\nscratch-pad. Then she looked up at me in bewilderment.\n\n\"This doesn't make much sense, Mr. Tompkins,\" she told me, \"but here it\nis. So far as I can make out, in March you went on a long trip and had\nsome kind of bad accident. There's Neptune and Saturn in conjunction\nunder Aries and Venus in opposition. That could mean more trouble\nwith that girl, I s'pose. Then early in April you came under a new\nsign--money it looks like, lots, of it, and Venus is right for you. It\nlooks like happiness. Now for the future, there's something I don't\nunderstand. There's a sort of jumble--an accident mebbe--right ahead of\nyou and then some kind of crisis. You're going to live quite happy with\na woman for a while--and, well, that's all I can see, except--\" she\npaused.\n\nI raised my eyebrows. \"Except what?\" I asked. \"I want the truth.\"\n\nShe lowered her head. \"It _might_ be a bad illness,\" she said, \"but\nit's the combination I generally call a death--somebody else's death,\nthat is. You aren't planning to murder anybody, are you?\"\n\nI leaned back in my chair and laughed heartily.\n\n\"Good Lord, no! Miss Clump. And even if I did I have money enough to\nhire somebody to do it for me--like the government. Here's a check for\nyou,\" I added. \"Two thousand, I think you said.\"\n\n\"Be careful,\" she told me in a low voice, almost in a whisper. \"Be\nvery, very careful. I don't like to see that combination in the stars.\nIt might mean bad trouble.\"\n\nI rejoined Harcourt in the downstairs bar of the Vanderbilt Hotel and\ngave him a quick account of Miss Clump's forecast.\n\n\"That looks pretty hot,\" he allowed, \"except that it sounds like\nanybody. The usual line is money coming in, successful trouble, and\njust call again sometime. Anyhow, the Bureau doesn't handle murder and\nyou don't look like a killer to me, even though you've got yourself\nback in good shape, physically, I mean.\"\n\n\"She sounded pretty much in earnest,\" I told him, \"but I'm damned if I\nknow where I'd begin if I went in for a career of killing.\"\n\n\"So you think she's on the level?\" he asked. \"It's all hooey to me.\"\n\nI considered carefully before I answered him.\n\n\"The astrologers claim,\" I told him, \"that they practice an exact\nscience. They have won law-suits based on that claim and have won\nexemption from the old statutes against gypsies and fortune tellers.\nMiss Clump is a good showwoman. Her fees are high as the Chrysler\nBuilding and her office costs plenty. No stuffed owls or dried bats or\nany junk that would make a businessman think he was going slumming.\nWhen she talked to me she seemed honestly surprised at what she claimed\nshe saw in the stars and she certainly sounded entirely in earnest when\nshe warned me. My guess is that she's on the level and has nothing to\ndo with Von Bieberstein, if there is such a person.\"\n\nHarcourt sipped his Coca-Cola, being on duty and hence not drinking, in\nofficial silence.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he agreed at last. \"Could be, though we'll have to check her\nand her secretary and her clients, right up to but _not_ including\nDemocratic Senators and Cabinet officers.\"\n\n\"How about barbershops?\" I asked him. \"Or drugstores? I've always\nthought they'd make the best intelligence centers in America. You can't\nkeep track of everybody who buys a dime's worth of aspirin or a package\nof Kleenex. What's to prevent the cigar counter at any hotel or drug\nstore being the place where two Nazi agents meet. The clerks wouldn't\nknow them and in a town like this nobody would even notice them.\"\n\nThe Special Agent finished his drink and banged the glass down on\nthe table. \"That's just the trouble with this town,\" he announced.\n\"There's so many services here that everybody uses you can't possibly\ncheck them. Well, you run on down to your office and see if you can't\nfind out something else. Thanks for the lift on Miss Clump. Now I've\ngot to call headquarters and get a special detail to go to work on her.\"\n\n\"You don't seriously think that she knows anything about Von\nBieberstein, do you?\" I asked.\n\nHe smiled ruefully. \"No, I don't, but the way you describe her,\nshe's a sort of nice, old-fashioned woman, and yet she drags down a\nthousand bucks for fifteen minutes of astral horse-feathers in this\ntough burg. There's something screwy about a set-up like that. Now\nI've seen the files on most of the big-time astrologers that operated\nhere--Evangeline Adams and Myra Kingsley were tops in their time--and\nthere's not one of them can touch this Clump woman for money. I don't\nforget that the first woman I ever arrested--it was before I joined the\nBureau and I was on the homicide detail in Raleigh--was just as sweet\nand gentle as your Aunt Minnie. All she'd done was poison her husband\nand her two children so's to be free to sleep with her brother-in-law.\nSo it's going to be plenty work for the Bureau to check this one,\nbefore we're sure she's okay.\"\n\nI told him that I didn't enjoy being put in the position of an F.B.I.\nTyphoid Mary, who automatically exposed his acquaintances to immediate\nvisitations of G-men.\n\n\"Shucks! Mr. Tompkins,\" he assured me, \"they'll never know we're\naround. We got a pretty smooth outfit now and we have ways of checking\nyou never dreamed of. When we go to work, we do a neat job and if we\ndon't learn anything, well, that's that--but we don't bother folks\nwhile were doing it.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I agreed. \"I'll be down at the office until the morning.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 28\n\n\nThe highly respectable receptionist at the office of Tompkins, Wasson &\nCone almost smiled at me.\n\n\"There are several gentlemen waiting for you, Mr. Tompkins,\" she\nannounced. \"Some of them have been here since before lunch. Do you plan\nto receive them or shall I ask them to return tomorrow?\"\n\n\"No, I'll see them in a few minutes,\" I replied. \"Miss Briggs will let\nyou know.\"\n\nNo sooner had I settled down at my desk, however, than Graham Wasson\nand Phil Cone came dancing in, wreathed in tickertape.\n\n\"We're rich! We're rich!\" they chanted.\n\n\"Where's the Marine Band and 'Hail to the Chief'?\" I asked. \"How rich\nare we, anyway?\"\n\n\"We cleaned up,\" Wasson said. \"Just a bit under three million in\none week. It was as you said. We went short of the market and after\nRoosevelt's death, boy! did they liquidate! And thanks to Phil here, we\ngot out before the big boys put the squeeze on the shorts.\"\n\n\"That reminds me, Winnie,\" Cone interrupted, \"one of the mourners\nin the customers room who's waiting to see you is Jim DeForest from\nMorgan's. He's been waiting here since two o'clock. You'd better see\nhim quick, huh? We don't want to keep 23 Wall waiting, do we?\"\n\n\"Nuts, Phil,\" I told him. \"I'll see them in the order of their arrival.\nThat's what they do at Morgan's when you haven't got an appointment.\"\n\nI pushed the button for Arthurjean.\n\n\"Who's been waiting the longest, Miss Briggs,\" I asked.\n\nShe consulted a little pack of memo forms. \"There's this Mr.\nSylvester,\" she said. \"He was here when the office opened and has been\nwaiting here all day. He wouldn't state his business.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I replied. \"Send him in or he'll faint from hunger.\"\n\nMr. Sylvester was florid in a quiet Latin way and looked as though\nhe might be anything from an operatic tenor to the proprietor of a\ngambling ship. He waited until my partners had withdrawn.\n\n\"Mr. Tompkins,\" he said, speaking quietly, \"I represent a syndicate\nthat's reorganizing the free market in meat. We need a real smart guy,\nwell-connected, like yourself, to head it up and keep track of the\nmoney. We'll pay a million dollars a year any way you like it--Swiss\nbanks, Havana, Buenos Aires, Mexico City--and no tax.\"\n\n\"I'm always interested in a million dollars but I never did like\nAtlanta,\" I told him.\n\n\"Atlanta!\" He shrugged his shoulders. \"We got lawyers could talk Capone\nouta Alcatraz and we got a fix on the Courts, too. What would you be\ndoin' in Atlanta?\"\n\n\"I doubt that they'd make me librarian,\" I said, \"and I don't think I'd\nmake the ball-team, so I guess I'd have to work in the laundry. What's\nthe trouble with the black market, anyhow? Seems to me you've got\nO.P.A. right in your corner.\"\n\n\"Too many amateurs and outsiders,\" he told me, \"just like with\nProhibition. Meat's bad and too many cops get a cut. We aim to do like\nthe beer syndicates--organize it right, keep prices reasonable, have\nthe pay-off stabilized, make it a good banking proposition. We've\nchecked on you. You're smart. Would a million and a half do?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"I've got a million and a half,\" I remarked.\n\n\"Okay,\" Mr. Sylvester straightened up, shook my hand and gave a little\nbow. \"Think it over!\" he urged. \"If you change your mind put an ad in\nthe Saturday Review personal column. 'Meet me anywhere, Winnie!' That's\ncute. 'Meet' and 'Meat,' see? Our representative will call on you.\"\n\nI asked Arthurjean to send in the next visitor and to my surprise she\nannounced DeForest.\n\n\"Hell!\" I told her. \"There must have been others ahead of him.\"\n\n\"There was,\" she said, \"but they agreed to let him see you first. They\nsaid they'd be back tomorrow. They were from Goldman Sachs and Lehman\nBrothers so they wanted to give Morgan's first crack at you, I guess.\"\n\nJim DeForest proved to be one of the vaguely familiar figures I had\nnoticed flitting around the Harvard Club.\n\n\"Winnie,\" he said, \"I just dropped in to say that we have been pretty\nwell impressed by the way your firm handled itself in this recent\nmarket. Mr. Whitney wanted to know whether it would be convenient for\nyou to drop in and have a talk with him soon.\"\n\n\"Today?\" I asked.\n\nDeForest glanced at his Rolex. \"Today's a little late,\" he remarked,\n\"but give him a ring tomorrow. No, damn it! He's leaving for a short\ntrip to Washington. Make it next week and he'll have plenty of time for\nyou.\"\n\n\"What's it about, Jim?\" I asked. \"Don't tell me that I'm going to be\noffered a Morgan partnership?\"\n\nHe looked as though I had burped in church.\n\n\"I hardly think so,\" he replied. \"If that were the case, Mr. Lamont\nwould have seen you somewhere uptown. You know the way they gossip in\nthe Street. No, I rather fancy that Mr. Whitney wants you to be one of\nour brokers for floor operations. Or, he might, since you specialize\nin estate work, want you to help with some of the new issues we are\nplanning to underwrite.\"\n\n\"Either way would suit me fine, Jim,\" I told him. \"Do you know,\" I\ncontinued, \"this is the second happiest day of my life. The first was\nwhen I got married.\"\n\nDeForest seemed a bit relieved and permitted himself a worldly smile.\n\n\"And today,\" I continued, \"I received the greatest honor that can come\nto an American in Wall Street. Believe me, Jim, this means more than\nhaving just cleaned up three million dollars in straight trading. After\nall, what is money worth if it can't buy what isn't for sale?\"\n\nThis idea seemed to be taken under DeForest's advisement for future\nconsideration but he let it pass. After all, a million dollars is dross\ncompared to the approval of the employers of men like Jim DeForest,\nstill limping along on twenty-five thousand a year twenty years after\ngraduation.\n\n\"Grand to have seen you, Winnie,\" he said, indicating that the audience\nwas at an end. \"I'll tell Mr. Whitney that you'll see him next week.\nAnd of course, no talk about this. We don't like to encourage gossip\nabout our operations.\"\n\nI promised that I would be silent as the grave, not even telling my\npartners or my wife. \"After all,\" I pointed out, \"it's not a good idea\nto arouse false hopes. Perhaps Mr. Whitney will change his mind.\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" DeForest said solemnly, as though I had mentioned the\npossibility of the Black Death. \"I most certainly hope not. We don't do\nbusiness on that basis, you know.\"\n\n\"Well, Miss Briggs, who's next?\" I inquired, after DeForest had\nwithdrawn with the affable air of royalty inspecting a clean but\nsecond-rate orphan asylum.\n\n\"Since those bankers left, there's only three waiting. One's a general\nbut he comes after this other man, what's his name, Patrick Michael\nShaughnessy, whoever he is.\"\n\n\"Send in the Irish,\" I told her.\n\nMr. Shaughnessy was an Irish-American counterpart of the Mr. Sylvester\nwho wanted to reorganize the free market for meat. He was a natty\ndresser and he spoke out of the corner of his mouth.\n\n\"Mr. Tompkins,\" he told me, \"I'm from, the Democratic National\nCommittee. The Chairman--and gee! Bob's a wonder--wanted to ask whether\nyou'd consider a diplomatic appointment.\"\n\n\"Of course, I would,\" I replied, thinking of Germaine's artless desire\nto be an Ambassadress, \"but that depends on where I'm sent and that\nkind of thing. What have you in mind?\"\n\n\"There's only one post open right now,\" he remarked. \"That's Bolonia or\nPeruna or hell, no, it's Bolivia. That's somewhere in America, ain't\nit?\"\n\nI agreed that Bolivia was located in the Western Hemisphere. \"That's\nwhere the tin and llamas come from, Mr. Shaughnessy,\" I educated him.\n\"The capital city of La Paz is located about twelve thousand feet high\nin the Andes and the inhabitants are mainly Indians. I don't think that\nMrs. Tompkins would care for it.\"\n\nHis face fell. \"You'd be an Ambassador, of course,\" he informed me,\n\"and that's always worth something. But the Boss said--that's Bob, of\ncourse, we all call Bob the Boss--that if you wouldn't fall for Bolivia\nto ask you what about Ottawa. That's the capital of Canada. It's right\nnext to Montreal and those places and there's good train service to\nNew York on the Central any time you want to run down for a show or a\nhair-cut. Bob said Canada was a real buy.\"\n\n\"Oh, a buy?\" I remarked.\n\nShaughnessy looked at me shrewdly. \"Uh-huh!\" he replied.\n\n\"How much will it cost me to be Ambassador to Canada?\"\n\nShaughnessy was faintly aggrieved. \"The Boss don't like to talk about\nmoney and jobs that way, Mr. Tompkins. He always says think of the\nchance to serve the country. Say, you're a good Democrat or if you\naren't a Democrat you're the next thing to it, a Republican that is,\nand you want to make a contribution to the Party. We always got a\ndeficit, see. If there ain't one now there's one coming right up. Say\nyou lay two or three hundred grand on the line. That goes a hundred\ngrand to the Committee and another hundred grand divided among the\nState Committees. You see, we got to take care of the Senate so they'll\nvote to confirm you and there are some operators up there what won't\nvote for nothing 'cept they get taken care of first. Then the rest\nwe put into a dignified publicity campaign, to build you up with the\npublic and let the Canucks see they're getting something special when\nthe President nominates you.\"\n\nI considered this one carefully. \"Do you let me pick the public\nrelations firm that handles that end of the campaign, Mr. Shaughnessy?\"\n\nHe grinned artlessly. \"I should say not!\" he chuckled. \"How do you\nthink we boys on the Committee make a living? No, we pick the firm\nthat does the job and that's all you need worry about. We own 'em. So\nyou see you're protected right across the board. Any time we sell an\nAmbassadorship, we deliver.\"\n\n\"Doesn't the State Department have something to say about it?\"\n\nShaughnessy told me exactly what the State Department could do about\nit, so I told him to let me have a few days to think it over. After\nall, three hundred thousand dollars was quite a lot of money to pay\nfor a diplomatic post. It wasn't as though I could make it pay off in\nScotch whiskey or mining shares as in the past.\n\n\"That's what you think,\" the agent of the Democratic National Committee\nrapped out. \"Listen, Mr. Tompkins, if you buy that job take me along as\nyour private secretary and I'll show you how to make it pay like a bank\nand no ifs. What shall I tell the gang?\"\n\n\"Tell them I'm definitely interested,\" I replied truthfully, \"but I'd\nlike a couple of weeks to think it over.\"\n\nMy next visitor was General Forbes-Dutton of the Army Service Forces.\n\n\"Remember me, Winnie?\"\n\n\"Why sure!\" I replied with great cordiality. \"If it isn't--\"\n\n\"That's right,\" the General interrupted. \"Well, boy, after Pearl Harbor\nI got me--I was asked to go to Washington to help out, so the bank\nsaid it was my duty, that they'd hold my job for me, and I've been\nthere ever since. I'm on Westervelt's staff, in charge of financial\nprocurement policies. Neat, eh?\"\n\n\"So you're still working for the bank?\"\n\n\"Not _for_ them, Winnie. _With_ them. We're both working for the\ngovernment. Financing war-contracts, you know. Now Westervelt's heard\ngood things about you, Winnie. He was much impressed by the way you\nturned down that gang of chiselers who tried to horn in on the quinine\ndeal. They're all out. He's got a big job in mind for you. How'd you\nlike to be a Brigadier-General?\"\n\n\"It's a little late for that,\" I told him. \"The war's almost over.\"\n\nHe laughed very heartily. \"It's a honey of a job, Winnie. Here's what\ngives. This war's almost over, as you say. Then the Army will have\nthe job of selling off the stuff it doesn't need and boy! it has\neverything. We've just about cornered everything there is and the whole\nworld's going to be crying for the stuff. We want a good trader in\ncharge, who knows how to play ball with the boys, realistic that is.\nNo star-gazer, eh? And that's where you come in. There's millions in\nit. Hell! there's billions. We got to go slow in selling it or we'd\nbust the market, wreck values and stall reconversion, so we had us a\nbrain-storm when we heard how you cleaned up in the Funeral Market. How\nabout it? Want to play ball and get next to the biggest break you ever\nheard of?\"\n\nI looked Forbes-Dutton squarely in the eye.\n\n\"Isn't it going to be a headache?\" I asked. \"I mean, won't there be a\nstink in Congress about it? I'm no fall-guy.\"\n\nThe General shook his head. \"Congress is in on it, every man jack of\nthem outside a few screwballs,\" he assured me. \"We got a deal worked\nout in every District--all legal and clean, of course--so there isn't\na Senator or Congressman that can't march right up to the trough and\nget his. Hell! there's so much of it--food, tractors, jeeps, clothes,\nships, machine-tools, factories even--that we could buy every\nCongressman ten times over and still have plenty of glue. With you on\ntop--\"\n\n\"It still sounds as though you were looking for a fall-guy,\" I told him.\n\nHe again laughed merrily. \"Anywhere you fall in this surplus game you'd\nstill land soft and be in clover. What about it? Shall I phone the\nPentagon?\"\n\n\"Sorry to stall you,\" I said, \"but I've got to think it over. I've got\nto talk to my lawyer. I'd still like to come down to Washington and\nstudy the angles.\"\n\n\"Angles? Hell! This hasn't any more angles than a big ripe watermelon.\nBrigadier-General's not a bad title for a post-war use. When these\nG.I.'s come back they'll want to find soldiers running things. Okay,\nWinnie, I see your point. I'll tell the General you'll be coming down\nto look the ground over. You'll get the Order of Merit, of course--\"\n\n\"I've already got it,\" I informed him.\n\n\"The hell you say! That's wonderful. Well, then we'll fly you over to\nLondon or Brisbane and give you a couple of theatre citations to dress\nyou up. After a couple of weeks on Ike's or Mac's staff you'll have a\nbuild-up like nobody's business. Then we make a killing. 'Bye!\"\n\nWhen the door closed behind General Forbes-Dutton I called for\nArthurjean.\n\n\"Honey,\" I told her, \"get me a snort of brandy and accept my personal\napologies to the entire female sex for any time I have ever made use of\nthe word 'whore'.\"\n\n\"What's eating you, Winnie?\" she asked.\n\n\"I've just been propositioned by two gentlemen who would be\ncomplimented if you called them prostitutes,\" I told her. \"The only\nhonest man I've met today was that first little guy. All he wanted me\nto do was to help reorganize the Black Market. Who's left now?\"\n\n\"There's only this one man who calls himself Charles G. Smith and has\nbeen waiting some time. He looks like a crank. Shall I give him a\nhand-out and tell him to go away?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"I can't take much more of the current brand of\npatriotism.\"\n\nCharles G. Smith was a small, wispy man, with a protruding Adam's\napple, buck teeth and shabby clothes. He ignored my outstretched hand\nand advanced on me, with a glittering eye.\n\n\"Mr. Tompkins,\" he announced, in a curiously deep, velvety voice, \"you\nhave made millions of dollars that you must soon leave behind you.\nYou have invested years of your life in collecting and keeping those\ndollars--little disks of metal, little slips of paper. What have you\ninvested in the only thing you will be permitted to take with you when\nyou leave?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\n\"I mean your immortal soul, Mr. Tompkins, your immortal soul,\" said Mr.\nCharles G. Smith.\n\n\"Oh Lord! A religious crank!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Naturally,\" he agreed proudly. \"I'd rather be crazy about God than\nnuts about money. Why not?\"\n\nI looked at him with growing respect. \"Why not, indeed?\" I thought.\n\n\"My case is out of your line, Mr. Smith,\" I told him.\n\n\"They all say that,\" he replied, \"but God doesn't think so.\"\n\n\"My case _is_ different,\" I repeated. \"You see, I have not one but two\nimmortal souls.\"\n\nHe nodded benignly. \"I know,\" he said. \"God told me that you were in\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"That sounds as though you and I were buddies, Mr. Smith,\" I observed.\n\"Where can I find Him? It will take God Himself to straighten out my\ncase.\"\n\nSmith shrugged his shoulders. \"You can't find Him,\" he said. \"You've\ngot to wait until He finds you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 29\n\n\n\"Nonsense!\" Germaine said emphatically. Hers was the authoritative tone\nof a mother assuring her child that the lightning cannot possibly hit\nthe house in a thunderstorm.\n\n\"I don't see how you can call it nonsense,\" I told her. \"There he stood\nin my office, a little man with a big Adam's apple, telling me that\nGod was on my track. I'm used to being followed by the F.B.I., but now\nthis!\"\n\nShe stretched out in her chaise longue before the bedroom fire until I\nthought of the Apostle who stated that the Lord delighteth not in any\nman's legs. Obviously, he had never seen my wife's gams.\n\n\"He sounds like a religious maniac,\" she observed.\n\n\"He admitted it, Jimmie. He was even proud of it. When he was standing\nthere he seemed to make more sense than most things that happen in Wall\nStreet. He could be right.\"\n\nGermaine giggled. \"If God finds you, Winnie,\" she said, \"I hope He\ndoesn't arrive when--I mean, it might be rather embarrassing?\"\n\n\"Again the one-track mind,\" I remarked. \"You don't suppose that sex is\nany news to the Old Man, do you? He invented it, darling.\"\n\n\"You know, Winnie,\" she replied dreamily, \"sometimes you are almost a\npoet. Just the same, if He came after me I'd like to have Him find me\nwith a new hairdo.\"\n\n\"So far as I am concerned,\" I told her, \"it's just as well the Old\nMan didn't catch up with me on some recent occasions. He might have\nreceived a false impression of my eligibility for the Club.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" Germaine remarked with great decision. \"He'd better not try any\nnonsense with you if I'm around. You're my Winnie and you're going to\nHeaven right along with me if I have to cheat the Customs.\"\n\nI yawned. \"I hope Saint Peter will be suitably impressed and not like\nthose tough guys at the Port of New York. What I'd really like to get\nat is all this business about Von Bieberstein. I'd never heard of him\ntill last week and now it's got me jittery. Who he is God only knows\nand He hasn't tipped off the F.B.I.\"\n\n\"I'm not very religious, darling,\" my wife said, \"but from what I\nremember from Sunday School, God wasn't supposed to be a tattle-tale.\nHe'll take care of Von Bieberstein, if there is such a person.\"\n\nI laughed. \"If there isn't, the F.B.I.'s going to look awfully silly\nwhen they come to write the history books. J. Edgar Hoover would turn\nover in his job at the very thought.\"\n\n\"You know,\" she continued drowsily, \"I think that Von Bieberstein is\njust a name they've given to all the things they can't solve. Like\nluck. You know the way people say, 'Bad Luck!' Well, the F.B.I. says\n'Von Bieberstein' every time a ship sinks or a factory makes the wrong\nkind of shell. You wait and see, Winnie, and you'll find out I am\nright.\"\n\n\"Speaking of luck,\" I asked, \"What's the news from the kennels? Has\nPonto met his fiancee yet or haven't the banns been published?\"\n\n\"Dalrymple seemed to think that it would be very easy to equip him with\na suitable girl friend,\" she said demurely. \"It appears that there's a\nwar-time shortage of sires or something, so I gather that there's no\nparticular problem in Ponto's love-life. Dalrymple said we could come\nand get him the end of the week--Friday or Saturday. Poor dear. I think\nwe ought to put orange blossoms in his dog-biscuit when he gets home.\"\n\nI laughed. \"That's one load off my mind. I hope you're right and that\nit will steady him down. They say that the responsibilities of marriage\ndo wonders for a young dog. It makes him respect property, maintain the\nsocial order, and vote the straight Republican ticket.\"\n\n\"Idiot!\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm thinking of running Ponto in the next election. He'd make a\nmighty fine Governor and he'd be sure to leave his mark in the Senate.\nWho knows, we might even elect him President.\"\n\nGermaine stretched again, with considerable candor. \"Darling,\" she\nannounced, \"you're dithering. Let's go to bed.\"\n\n\"Not until we get this religious argument straightened out,\" I\nobjected. \"I think I owe it to Mr. Smith to make some kind of move. The\npoliticians and the psychiatrists have failed me. There's only religion\nleft. And besides, I still have half of my drink to finish.\"\n\nI put another birch-log on the fire and watched as the flames\nbrightened and cast a flickering glow on the canopy of my wife's bed.\n\n\"My idea's this,\" I told her. \"It's very undignified to sit around\nwaiting for the Old Man to look me up, if He's really trying to find\nme, as Smith says. I think I'd better start a search party of my\nown. There are no doubt a lot of things He'll want to ask me about,\nbut there are some points on which, damn it! I'm entitled to an\nexplanation.\"\n\n\"You talk such rot, darling,\" she murmured. \"Wise gods never explain\nanything. It's take it or leave it. You just wait. You'll see.\"\n\n\"I'd like to know who Von Bieberstein is, just to get ahead of A. J.\nHarcourt. If the Old Man won't tell me that, at least I'm entitled to\nknow who I am.\"\n\n\"You're my Winnie,\" she repeated half-asleep. \"I'll see that you get\npast the immigration authorities. I'll smuggle you in under my skirts,\nlike Helen of Troy. St. Peter's far too respectable a man to try to\nsee what I've got there.\"\n\n\"Now _you're_ maudlin,\" I told her. \"From what I know of Greek\ncostumes, Helen of Troy couldn't have smuggled a Chihuahua into Troy\nunder what _she_ wore. Anyhow, these saints have X-ray eyes that can\nspot a sin right through skirt, girdle and brassiere. Besides, I weigh\ntoo much. I'm much more like the unforgivable sin. Suppose I just\npretend I lost my passport.\"\n\n\"It will be all right, darling,\" Germaine assured me. \"And if they\nwon't let us into Heaven, God knows they'd be delighted to put us up\nin Hell. It would raise the value of real estate overnight. I can just\nhear the Devil arguing with prospective tenants. 'We have such nice\npeople in the next bed of coals. They're from Westchester and the\nname's Tompkins'.\"\n\n\"Any time a real estate agent urges you to take a residence, that's\nHeaven,\" I told her. \"You dither delightfully, especially when you're\nhalf asleep. But I don't want to get into Hell on false pretenses. It's\nnot fair to the management. What I propose to do is to go out, and see\nif I can't find the Old Man before He finds me, and see if I can't\nfix up my passport right now. As you say, it could be embarrassing\notherwise. Then I'll march straight up to Him, look Him in the eye and\nask Him what the Hell He means--\"\n\nShe sat up and held out her glass. \"More brandy,\" she ordered.\n\nI fixed her drink and my own and looked at the coals of the log-fire.\n\n\"How are you going to set out?\" Germaine asked. \"No, don't laugh,\ndarling. It might be quite important. You see, if I--if we--Oh, if we\nshould have a child, it would be good to know--\" she paused, at a loss\nfor words.\n\n\"It does sound crazy, doesn't it?\" I said. \"'Middle-aged Stock Broker\nCleans up in Wall Street, Looks for God.' Well, I suppose the best\nthing to do is to consult the clergymen.\"\n\n\"Then you'd better not start in Westchester,\" she advised. \"They're all\nbleating celibates like poor old Ponto or broad-clothed men of affairs\nwho shoot a darn good game of golf and never offend the vestrymen.\nI'd try New York City, if I were you, Winnie. They have the best\narchitects, the best food, the best doctors, the best actors, and the\nbest red-heads in the world. They might even have the best clergymen.\"\n\n\"That doesn't follow,\" I told her, \"but I agree the chances are better\nthere than up here.\"\n\n\"I'm going to approach this thing scientifically,\" I continued. \"I'm\ngoing to pick a Protestant--probably a Presbyterian--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she agreed. \"_Do_ pick a Presbyterian. They build such lovely\nNew England churches and they believe in infant damnation, or is that\nthe Mormons?\"\n\n\"Shush!\" I rebuked her. \"As I was saying when you so rudely interrupted\nme, a Presbyterian, and they believe in predestination with only\noccasional leanings to infant damnation. And then I'll try a Jewish\nRabbi. I'm told that they are very highly educated men with a grasp\nof spiritual fundamentals as well as a remarkable fund of practical\nknowledge. And, of course, a Catholic priest.\"\n\n\"Not Father Aloysius Murphy!\" Germaine besought me. \"I couldn't bear it\nif you consulted him. I don't know why and of course I'm not a Catholic\nbut every time I hear him on the radio I wish the Pope would send him\nas a missionary to Russia. Please don't pick any of these fashionable\npriests or rabbis, darling. Try to find simple, poor men who aren't\ntrying to advertise themselves or raise money.\"\n\nI finished my drink and picked her up in my arms. \"It's long past\nbed-time,\" I told her. \"Here, drink it down and I'll put you to bed.\nI didn't know you gave a damn about religion and here you are talking\nlike a Joan of Arc or--\"\n\nShe put her empty glass down on the bed-side table and slipped out of\nher dressing-gown.\n\n\"You don't know me very well,\" she said quietly. \"To you, I'm just your\nwife, not a separate person at all, and it's rather nice, but--No, I'm\nnot religious and Heaven knows the saints would have hysterics if they\nheard you call me Joan of Arc. It's just that--Well, I was brought up\non church and Sunday School and the Catechism and forgot it all as soon\nas I graduated from Miss Spence's and had my coming-out party. But\nthey are all so proud and grand, these clergymen. They are so sure of\nthemselves. I once went to an Easter service in Washington, it was at\nSt. Thomas's, when the sermon was entirely devoted to a passionate plea\nfor money, money, money. I've never met a clergyman yet who didn't hint\nthat while the Lord loved my soul, the Church would settle for cash.\"\n\n\"I suppose the churches need money like everybody else,\" I suggested.\n\"At least they don't charge admission like the movies.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know they need money but they can't need money as much as people\nneed goodness or God or whatever it is they do need. I'd like to find\na single good simple man who wasn't too sure of himself. Well, I\ncan't explain. Get undressed and come to bed, darling. The sheets are\nbitterly cold.\"\n\nI chucked my clothes onto the chair by the fire.\n\n\"Hell!\" I exclaimed. \"That would be too awful!\"\n\nGermaine made a vague questioning noise.\n\n\"Suppose we are resurrected not as we'd like to be but as we are. You'd\nbe safe. You have the build of an angel and you'd be a knockout with\nwings, but I'd look like a ringer even in the best of haloes and with\nthis weight I'd need a terrific wing-spread to get off the ground. Even\nthen, I'd have to have a run-way.\"\n\nI fixed the fire so it would keep burning for a couple of hours and\nadjusted the fire-screen so that there was no chance of a stray spark\nlanding on the carpet. Then I crossed to the window overlooking\nthe lawn and opened it on the cool spring night. The moon, now\nsuspiciously less virginal in figure but still shamelessly serene\nin silver, rode in the western sky and the scents of spring drifted\nin on the light breeze. There was no sound save the distant jingling\nof the peepers and the near-by rustle of the dry vines outside the\nwindow-frame.\n\n\"I wish to God I knew who I am,\" I muttered.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 30\n\n\n\"No doubt you'll be asking me to reconcile predestination and free\nwill,\" observed Dr. Angus McGregor, minister of the Tenth Presbyterian\nChurch of Manhattan.\n\n\"That wasn't quite my question, sir,\" I replied. \"I asked you whether\nyou could justify the Lord's putting my soul into another man's body.\nAm I to be responsible for the sins the other man committed?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Dr. McGregor remarked, with relish, \"It is the Lord's doing\nand it is marvelous in our eyes. No doubt he kens what he's about.\nIt will all be made known on the great Day of Judgment. Now about\npredestination and free will, you'll have marked that many grand\nphilosophers and divines have debated the point. 'Tis a nice point.\n'Tis the theological _pons asinorum_.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I interrupted, \"but do you consider that I am bound by this body\nor will I be returned to my own before I come to the Judgment? And is\nmy soul involved in another man's sins?\"\n\nDr. McGregor drew a deep puff on his pipe. \"Oh aye!\" he declared.\n\"The principle of vicarious sacrifice has been observed ever since\nthat ne'er-do-weel Cain asked, 'Am I my brother's keeper?' Aye, Mr.\nTompkins, surely you are involved in the sins of others. Take your\nown case now. I believe your tale. Fearful and wonderful things have\nhappened in this weary world, before now, by the will of the Lord.\nIt is written by the Roman historian Tacitus that the pagan emperor\nVespasian--that grand benefactor to whom the world owes the fine\ninvention of the public comfort station--performed miracles in Egypt,\nmaking the blind to see, and healing the cripples. These miracles are\nas well attested as any in Holy Scripture. If the Lord permitted to a\nheathen potentate these gifts of spiritual healing, can I deny that\nHe might for His own good reasons permit your soul to inhabit another\nman's body?\"\n\n\"But what is my moral responsibility in this predicament, Dr. McGregor?\nWhere does my duty lie?\"\n\n\"It is all related to yon matter of free will and predestination,\" he\ninsisted. \"Your duty, man, is to fear the Lord and praise Him. You will\nhave taken this other man's wife, will you not? You will have taken his\nmoney and his home, his name and his business. Aye, if you take these\nlikely you will take his sins as well. Dinna believe that the Lord has\nno a reason for all this.\n\n\"Now,\" he continued, \"'tis no great difficulty to reconcile free will\nand predestination.\"\n\n\"I'm not a religious man, doctor,\" I cut him off, \"but you have given\nme help. Will you accept a check for your church--say a thousand\ndollars?\"\n\n\"Aye, Mr. Tompkins, I will that! I cannot help you but I can only tell\nyou to put your trust in the mercy and the justice of the Lord. 'Tis\nall a man can do.\"\n\nSo I wrote out a check for a thousand dollars to the order of the Tenth\nPresbyterian Church of Manhattan, and shook his hand.\n\nHe thanked me. \"Now,\" he announced. \"I must be on my way to comfort a\npoor body that's dying o' the cancer. 'Tis an old lady and she takes\ngreat comfort from her pain in the thought that she has been chosen by\nthe Lord to suffer for the sins of others. 'Tis no a sound theology,\nmind you, but 'tis a mighty solace as her time comes nigh.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy next stop was at the office of Rabbi Benjamin Da Silva of the Temple\nBen-David. Him I had located by consulting the classified telephone\ndirectory and had made an appointment to meet him in his study in the\nSynagogue. He was a slender, quietly dressed young man, with the eager\nface of a scholar and the air of repose of a mystic. The walls of his\nroom were lined with books and as I noted Hebraic, Greek, Latin and\nArabic titles, as well as German, French and English, I realized that I\nwas dealing with a deeply cultured man. His voice was musical and low,\nas he asked me to be seated.\n\n\"Rabbi Da Silva,\" I began, \"before I begin I would like to ask you to\naccept on behalf of your congregation a gift of a thousand dollars as\na token of my gratitude for consenting to hear my story. Perhaps you\ncan help me, perhaps not. As you realize, I am not of your faith but I\nneed your wisdom. I am trying to find my soul.\"\n\n\"So are we all, Mr. Tompkins,\" the Rabbi assured me. \"What is your\nproblem?\"\n\nI recited the events which made it imperative for me to recollect the\nevents prior to April second; I told him of the reasons that convinced\nme that I, Frank Jacklin, was living in Winfred Tompkins' body; I\noutlined the moral and personal problems involved in this confusion of\npersonalities; I indicated the psychiatric and other tests that had\nbeen made. Naturally, I did not mention the Alaska, the thorium bomb,\nZ-2 or Von Bieberstein.\n\nWhen I had completed my account, Rabbi Da Silva gazed abstractedly at\nthe small coal fire which smouldered in the grate of his study.\n\n\"Why did you come to me, Mr. Tompkins?\" he asked.\n\n\"Because I hoped that in your studies of the human soul, you might have\nfound knowledge that would help me.\"\n\nHe sat silent for some minutes.\n\n\"For many centuries,\" he began at last, \"there has been a curious\nbelief among you Christians that the Jewish rabbinate possesses mystic\nknowledge of the occult. No doubt that belief derives from the early\nMiddle Ages when the Jews became in part the means by which the science\nand culture of the Saracen East was brought to the ignorant barbarous\nWest. That service was turned against us by the superstitions and\nprejudices of Christendom and we were regarded as akin to sorcerers and\nwitch-masters. Even today in Germany, we are paying for our crime of\nhaving brought enlightenment to Europe in the Dark Ages.\"\n\n\"Then you can't help me?\" I asked.\n\n\"I did not say so, Mr. Tompkins,\" the Rabbi replied. \"Certainly I\ncannot help you in any occult manner. I cannot pick a book from the\nshelves, mutter a few words in Hebrew and resolve your spiritual\nproblems with a whiff of brimstone. The casting out of devils is not\nincluded in Judaism. Indeed, it has gone out of fashion in Christendom.\"\n\n\"What can you suggest?\" I inquired. \"Many important events, including\nthe possible capture of a dangerous Nazi spy, depend on my recovering\nmy memory.\"\n\n\"Even with that inducement,\" the Rabbi remarked with an ironic smile,\n\"I am not in a position to urge any particular course on you. Assume,\nfor the sake of argument, that you are the victim of what is called\na demoniac possession, Mr. Tompkins. Are you sure that you would be\nbenefited by casting out the soul of Frank Jacklin and resuming command\nof your own personality? Is not Winfred Tompkins a better and happier\nman under the influence of Jacklin than he was as himself? In other\nwords, Mr. Tompkins, you may not be seeking to cast out a devil at all,\nbut an angel of the Lord. Of course, I am speaking in moral metaphor\nand not as a scientist or a theologian. My advice to you would be to\nignore your loss of memory and live out your life as best you can and\nbe thankful that whatever it is that caused this change has been for\nyour betterment and has brought happiness to others.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"I know that I am foolish to insist, Rabbi Da Silva,\"\nI said. \"What you say is just about what the psychiatrists advised. Yet\nI must open that locked door and see what is hidden in the secret room.\"\n\nDa Silva smiled gently. \"Yes,\" he agreed, \"I see that you must.\nBluebeard's wife felt much the same and the charm and universal meaning\nof that great fable is that humanity must always open the closed doors,\neven at the risk of destruction. All wisdom urges us to leave well\nenough alone, yet our instinct is wiser than wisdom itself. God bless\nyou, Mr. Tompkins, and may you come to no harm if you find the key to\nthis locked room.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" I said. \"Now there remain only the Catholics. Perhaps\na parish priest--\"\n\n\"I shall be very much surprised if a priest advises you differently,\nMr. Tompkins,\" the Rabbi observed. \"Drop in again some time and tell\nme, will you?\"\n\nI gave him his check for the Temple Ben-David and went on to the\nrectory of St. Patrick's-by-the-Gashouse, where I asked for the priest.\n\n\"Sure, Father Flanagan's celebrating Mass,\" the aged housekeeper\nrebuked me.\n\n\"I'll wait,\" I told her. \"I have a contribution for the church. I must\ngive it to him personally.\"\n\n\"Glory be!\" she remarked, and withdrew, muttering.\n\nFather Flanagan was a burly, well-built young Irish-American with a\nfriendly smile and a crushing handshake.\n\n\"Mrs. Casey tells me you have something for the church, Mr.--\"\n\n\"My name's Tompkins, Father. I have a check for a thousand dollars.\nI'll give it to you now. There are no strings to it but I'd like to ask\nyou to help me.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be--You know, Mr. Tompkins,\" Father Flanagan told me, \"just\nthis morning at breakfast Mrs. Casey said she was praying that we'd\nfinish raising the money for the new altar before the Bishop's visit,\nand here it is. Isn't that wonderful, now?\"\n\n\"There you are, Father,\" I told him, \"and welcome to it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Tompkins,\" the priest said simply. \"I shall remember\nyou in my prayers and so, no doubt, will Mrs. Casey. You're not a\nCatholic, of course?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied. \"I don't seem to be anything that makes sense\nmedically, legally or morally. I need help.\"\n\nSo I told him the whole story from beginning to end, and added the\nadvice I had already received from Dr. McGregor and Rabbi Da Silva.\n\nFather Flanagan heard me out and then considered carefully.\n\n\"I've heard some strange things in Confession,\" he stated at last, \"but\nthey never taught us at Notre Dame how to deal with a problem like\nyours. I'd rather like to consult the Bishop before I undertook to\nadvise you. Do you mind?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" I told the priest. \"It's no disrespect for your bishop.\nIt's just that I feel that this problem must be solved on a low level\nrather than by the higher echelons. In the Navy, we soon learned that\nthe best way to get a problem loused up was to refer it to CINCPAC.\nWhat is your own reaction to my story?\"\n\nFather Flanagan pursed his lips and pondered for a moment. \"Speaking\nas a man,\" he said, \"and not as a priest, it looks to me as though you\nwere sitting pretty, Mr. Tompkins. Naturally, I have no explanation for\nit and the psychiatrists seem to have given you a clean bill of health,\nso maybe you're not crazy. I have a vague idea that there's reference\nto something like your experience in the Patristic writings which I\nread when I was studying for the priesthood. It's all mixed up with the\nGnostics and necromancy but it's hard to tell how much you can accept\nliterally in that material. Pagan literature is full of it, such as\nApuleius' 'The Golden Ass', in which a witch turns a man into a donkey,\nbut that's admittedly fancy. As I say, you seem to be sitting pretty.\nBy your own account, Commander Jacklin's life was pretty much of a\nfailure and Tompkins was not exactly what you could call a huge moral\nsuccess. Yet you, as Jacklin, seem to be doing a pretty good job with\nTompkins' life. Why don't you let it go at that?\"\n\n\"I can't, Father,\" I told him. \"I've got to find out what Tompkins was\ndoing just before Easter. Even if it's only for that one week, I've got\nto know.\"\n\n\"And you say that so far nobody has been able to help you?\"\n\n\"Nobody,\" I replied. \"The doctors call it trauma and say that my memory\nmay come back to me at any time, but I can't wait.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"'Can't' is a big and human word. Have you tried hypnotism?\nOr scopolamine? They aren't exactly liturgical and my Bishop would have\na fit if he heard me mention them--he considers them on a par with\nmediums and spiritualism--but they have some value in restoring memory.\"\n\nI slapped my knee. \"Thanks, Father!\" I exclaimed. \"You've given me an\nidea. I'll try a medium.\"\n\nThe priest looked grave. \"I wouldn't do that, now, if I were you, Mr.\nTompkins,\" he told me. \"That kind of thing is too close to Black Magic\nand devil-worship for decent men to play with.\"\n\n\"I hope I don't shock you, Father Flanagan,\" I replied, \"but if God\ncan't help me, I'll have to go to the Devil.\"\n\n\"I shall pray for you, Mr. Tompkins,\" the priest said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 31\n\n\nAfter I left St. Patrick's-by-the-Gashouse I went to a corner saloon\nand telephoned the F.B.I. I asked for Harcourt but was told that he was\nout to lunch, which reminded me that I was hungry. A private treaty\nwith the bartender brought me a steak sandwich, and no questions\nasked. Apple pie and coffee followed, and were not too horrible. I\nsmoked a cigarette, drank a second cup of coffee, and called the F.B.I.\nagain.\n\nThis time Harcourt had returned from lunch and he talked as though he\nhad swallowed the Revised Statutes of the United States but that they\ngave him indigestion.\n\n\"See here, Andy,\" I told him at last. \"I'm not looking for legal\nadvice, I want to consult a medium. Any medium. If I picked one out of\nthe phone-book you'd have the headache of checking on her, as I suppose\nyou're checking on the clergymen I saw this morning. So this time just\nsave yourself the trouble, and tell me who I should see.\"\n\n\"The Bureau doesn't endorse spiritualists,\" he informed me, but the old\nJ. Edgar Hoover spirit was running thin and his heart wasn't in it.\n\n\"I'm not asking the Bureau to endorse anything, not even a candy\nlaxative,\" I replied. \"Just you tell me the name and address of one\nreasonably respectable medium and I'll take care of the rest. And don't\npretend that the Bureau has no record of mediums in New York City.\"\n\n\"Mr. Tompkins,\" he said--and I could fairly hear the hum of the\nrecording machine on the telephone--\"The Bureau does not endorse any\nso-called spiritualist mediums. Naturally, under the leadership of our\npresent Director, the New York office has made a close check on all\nself-styled spiritualistic mediums in this city. One of these who has\nestablished her bona fides for purposes of identification only is Madam\nClaire la Lune, 1187 Lenox Avenue.\"\n\n\"Eleven eighty-seven Lenox,\" I repeated after him. \"That's in Harlem.\nMadam Claire la Lune sounds like the dark of the moon to me. Say, Andy,\nhasn't she a friend named Pierrot?\"\n\nThere was a pause at the other end of the wire. \"No, sir, Mr.\nTompkins,\" came the F.B.I. official voice.\n\n\"Okay,\" I told him. \"I suppose you'll have to check on her as on\neverybody else but I wanted you to start calling the shots so as to\nsave trouble for all of us. I'm going to consult Madam Lune, so you can\ntell your agents to rendezvous at 1187 Lenox Avenue. I'll be there in\nabout twenty minutes.\"\n\nEleven eighty-seven Lenox did not seem prepossessing from the spiritual\nangle. Madam la Lune's apartment was on the third floor, walk-up, and\nsmelled of cabbage, diapers and African sweat. Madam la Lune herself\nwas a light mulatto with a superb figure and a face so deeply scarred\nby smallpox that it looked like a map of Southern lynchings since 1921.\n\nShe seemed reluctant to deal with me on a professional basis, even\nafter I had offered her a twenty-dollar bill, until I told her that the\nF.B.I. had recommended her and that I needed her help.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"Tha's differ'nt. Jest you wait till I turn down my\nstove.\"\n\nShe ushered me into a close and smelly little room, with black velvet\ncurtains and a couch covered with black sateen. Madam la Lune lay down\non the couch and directed me to turn off the electric light from the\nswitch by the door. Although it was still early afternoon, the room\nwas so dark that I could barely make out the form of the medium or find\nmy way back to my chair.\n\nFor a time there was no sound except for the deep regular breathing of\nthe medium. Then suddenly came the shrill voice of a pickaninny.\n\n\"I'se here,\" the voice cried. \"It's Silver-Bell, mammy, I'se here.\"\n\nI smiled to myself in the Harlem dusk. It was so obviously the usual\nracket. There was the medium in her ten cent trance--the voice of her\n\"control\" was coming through. I had only to ask and I would receive a\nvague and blotting paper reply to any question.\n\n\"I'se here, mammy,\" the child's voice repeated. \"What you want, mammy?\nSilver-Bell's here.\"\n\nMadam la Lune snorted and snored on the couch. My eyes had become more\naccustomed to the dim light and I noticed how she had loosened her\nblouse so that her superb bust rose in twin-peaked Kilimanjaro against\nthe wall.\n\n\"Silver-Bell's here, mammy,\" the child's voice said again. \"What you\nwant?\"\n\n\"I want,\" I said, \"to speak to Frank Jacklin. He died in the North\nPacific about three weeks ago.\"\n\nThere was a pause, during which the snorting breaths of the medium were\nthe only sound in the smelly little room. Then the child's voice rose,\nshrill and petulant.\n\n\"You funning, mammy, you funning. They ain't no Jacklin over here.\nJacklin ain' dead. Jacklin sittin' right by yo' side, mammy. He police,\nmammy, he police.\"\n\nMadam la Lune stirred and I sensed her sightless eyes turning, turning\ntoward me in the dark.\n\n\"No, I'm not police, Silver-Bell,\" I said. \"If you can't find Jacklin,\nI want to speak to Winnie Tompkins.\"\n\nFor several minutes there was a long silence.\n\nThen came an impish giggle.\n\n\"Here's Mr. Tompkins, mammy, but my! he do look funny. He don' look\nlike he used ter look.\"\n\nAgain silence.\n\n\"Here he is, mammy. Here he is. What do you want to know?\"\n\n\"Ask him,\" I said, \"whether he is well and happy.\"\n\nThe hair rose on the back of my neck and a slow shiver ran down my\nspine as the answer came. The answer was the familiar barking of a\ndog--deep, strong, savage.\n\n\"Is that you, Ponto?\" I asked.\n\nThe answering bark came \"Woof! Woof!\"\n\n\"Where is Mr. Tompkins?\"\n\nMore \"woofs.\"\n\n\"Where is Commander Jacklin?\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Are you alive?\"\n\n\"Woof! Woof!\"\n\n\"Am I alive?\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Is your name Ponto?\" I ventured again.\n\n\"Where is Von Bieberstein?\" I demanded but my question was drowned in a\nstorm of barking.\n\n\"I's tired, mammy,\" came the child's voice. \"Silver-Bell's tired.\"\n\nThe voice trailed off, leaving me in the stifling little Harlem parlor\nwith the mulatto woman snoring.\n\nI sat, bemused, in the straight-back chair across the room from her.\nMy eyes had now got used to the thin light that filtered around the\nheavy black curtain. I noticed a fleck of white about the corners of\nher mouth and I made silent note of the way her body heaved with its\ntortured breathing. After a while, she stirred.\n\n\"You theah, Mr. Tompkins?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm here.\"\n\n\"You fin' out what you wan'?\" she inquired.\n\n\"I found out that you're a fraud,\" I told her. \"You're welcome to my\nmoney but I'm damned if I think you've earned it.\"\n\nShe sat up and adjusted her clothing calmly. \"What for you say that,\nMr. Tompkins?\" she demanded. \"Spirits come, and spirits go. You ask\nquestions. Maybe they give you the answers. I don't know.\"\n\n\"Very clever, Madam la Lune,\" I observed. \"Harcourt phones you I'm on\nmy way and tells you what to do. I'm supposed to come in and swallow it\nall. Well, I'm not interested in that game. All I want to know is how\nyou managed to imitate my dog?\"\n\nMadam la Lune rose and peered at me in the dusk.\n\n\"White man,\" she said. \"What dog you talkin' about? I ain't seen no\ndog.\"\n\nThe words I had planned to fling at her died in my throat. Fraud or\nnot, she was superb. Her pock-marked face had a haughty dignity and her\nbearing was that of a great queen.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I apologized, without knowing why. \"I'm in trouble. I\nhoped you could help me. All I got out of your trance was a child\nlaughing and a dog barking.\"\n\nHer eyes glowed in the twilit room.\n\n\"What this dog?\" she demanded. \"You know this dog?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I told her. \"It's my dog. His name is Ponto. He's a Great Dane\nand he's at the kennels.\"\n\n\"You go, Mr. Tompkins,\" she ordered me. \"You better go fast. That\ndog--wha's his color now?\"\n\n\"Black,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, black,\" She rolled her eyes until I saw the whites.\n\n\"That black dog don' mean no good to you or yours. You keep away fum\nthat dog, Mr. Tompkins. No, suh, I don't want you money. There's no\nluck with you, white man, with that black dog. I don' know how Ah\nknows, but Ah does know.\"\n\nAs I walked out into the bright cool air of Lenox Avenue, I felt\nrelieved. Madame la Lune was an interesting enough type. She obviously\nhad the primitive sense of second sight, intuition, whatever it is,\nthat let her penetrate behind human appearances. The medium business\nwas just a trade trick. In Africa or Haiti she could have been a\nwitch-doctor with a pet snake. In New Orleans, even, she would be a\nvoodoo priestess. Here in Harlem, she had become a medium. Of course,\nshe was a fraud, but how had she imitated the barking of the Great Dane?\n\nThen I laughed so loudly that a passing colored man sheered violently\naway from me. Of course, that was it. I had been right all the time.\nThis was Harcourt's work. He had recommended Madame la Lune to me and\nthen told her how to behave. Damn his insolence!\n\nI stopped dead and only stirred when the violent and prolonged sounding\nof an automobile horn reminded me that I was standing in the middle of\na cross-street. How did Harcourt know about Ponto when he had never\nseen him? And how could he tell the medium how to imitate Ponto's bark?\n\nOn the next corner was a dive--a saloon that advertised \"Attractions\"\nand from whose doors welled the jungle thumping of Harlem jazz.\n\nI slipped in and sat down at a corner table. A tall, colored girl,\nwhose scanty white silk blouse was not designed to conceal anything,\ncame over and leaned down to take my order.\n\n\"Wha' yo' want, honey-man?\" she asked sullenly.\n\nThe band on the platform let loose with a blast of traps and trombone.\n\n\"Let's dance,\" I said.\n\nShe nodded with a curious dignity and I found myself parading, dipping\nand swaying around a tiny dancefloor, while the black girl pressed her\nbody against me despairingly.\n\nI pulled off to the side and led her back to my table.\n\n\"Why do you do this?\" I asked.\n\nShe said nothing.\n\n\"You need money?\" I asked.\n\nShe still said nothing.\n\n\"Here!\" I said.\n\nI pulled out my check-book and wrote out a check for a thousand dollars\npayable to cash.\n\n\"This is for you,\" I told her. \"Take it and do whatever you want to do.\nThe check's good.\"\n\nThe girl looked at me, took the check, studied it. Then she rose, in\ncomplete silence, looked at me again and left me. She shrugged her\nway through the dancers and the waiters to the rear of the room and\ndisappeared. I did not know her name and I never saw her again.\n\nA high-ochre girl came over.\n\n\"Change yo' luck?\" she asked, bending over so that I could see down the\nfront of her scant-cut dress.\n\n\"My luck's done changed,\" I told her. \"Give me a drink and here's a\nten-spot for yourself. And I'll be on my way.\"\n\nShe tucked the bill down the front of her dress. \"May you have good\nluck, man,\" she said gravely.\n\nAs she said it, her eyes widened and her mouth hung open. \"Gawd!\" she\nmuttered. \"The black dog's follering you!\" and fled.\n\n\"I know,\" I said to the room at large, and left without waiting for my\ndrink.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 32\n\n\nI walked down Lenox Avenue to the first cigar-store and telephoned the\noffice.\n\nAs soon as I was connected with Arthurjean I asked her to meet me at\nher apartment as soon as she could make it. Then I hailed a cab and was\ndriven south through Central Park to the upper east Fifties' and my\nsecretary's apartment. She was waiting.\n\n\"Gee, honey,\" she exclaimed. \"I just got here. What's cooking?\"\n\nI followed her in and went straight to the kitchenette. I poured myself\na stiff drink and downed it rapidly. I poured myself another and\nturned to see her staring at me.\n\n\"You look terrible,\" she told me. \"What's happened to you?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you,\" I replied. \"You'd think I'm crazy and you'd turn me\nin.\"\n\n\"I will not!\"\n\nShe came up close to me and looked me square in the eye. \"I don't care\nif you're crazy as a bed-bug,\" she announced. \"Go on and 'pit it out in\nmomma's hand. I won't squeal.\"\n\n\"Sit down!\" I ordered, \"and get yourself a drink first. This is tough.\"\n\nShe sat and listened quietly as I outlined the latest developments.\n\n\"So you see,\" I concluded, \"I _can't_ tell anyone. They'd have me\nlocked up for keeps.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yeah,\" she agreed. \"I can see that.... Maybe your wife--\"\n\n\"I couldn't tell _her_,\" I contradicted. \"It would be too damn cruel\njust now when she's really happy.\"\n\nArthurjean sat and thought for a while. \"Yep,\" she remarked, as though\nshe had just concluded a long argument. \"You're right. You can't tell\nnobody _that_. How about this nosey A. J. Harcourt? Won't he find out?\nHe's still having you tailed.\"\n\n\"I don't see how he could,\" I told her, \"unless that Madame la Lune is\na complete phoney--which doesn't make sense. She and I were alone in\nthe room. If it was a plant, there's nothing to tell. If she's on the\nlevel she won't remember what went on.\"\n\n\"That's no plant,\" Arthurjean Briggs announced. \"It wouldn't make sense\nfor the F.B.I. to pull it. Harcourt sent you there in the first place\nbut he wouldn't put her up to a trick like that.\"\n\n\"He'll be hot on my trail then,\" I said. \"All those clergymen I saw\nwill have to be checked--when all the time--\"\n\n\"Do you know what I'd do if I was you,\" she said abruptly. \"I'd get rid\nof that damn dog--but fast.\"\n\n\"You mean sell it?\" I asked.\n\n\"I mean kill it. It isn't natural, acting that way. It's been worrying\nyou nigh crazy, that's what it's been doing. You just take it to the\nvet's and have it chloroformed. They do it all the time on account of\nthe rabbis--\"\n\n\"Rabies,\" I corrected.\n\n\"That's right, but they do it, don't they? You don't have to get\npermission. He's your property. You can tell the vet he bit you--\"\n\nI started up. \"Hell!\" I exclaimed. \"I've got to get him away from the\nkennels fast. It's--it's--\"\n\nArthurjean put her large, strong hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"There, honey,\" she soothed me. \"It's all right. It's going to be all\nright.\"\n\nI looked at her and realized that she hadn't believed a word of my\nstory.\n\n\"See here--\" I began, when the door-bell rang.\n\n\"Two-to-one it's Harcourt,\" I remarked.\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Arthurjean coloring faintly.\n\n\"Well, what's all this about?\" I demanded, as a slow blush gathered in\nsunset fury upon her pleasant face. \"Why, Arthurjean--\"\n\n\"Lay off,\" she begged. \"He's a nice guy and he hasn't got that\nfamily in Brooklyn he kept talking about. You and me are washed\nup--and--well, he's from the South, too, and he talks my language.\"\n\n\"Good luck,\" I told her. \"But he's also on the doorstep, so take hold\nof yourself.\"\n\nHe was. She did.\n\n\"'Evening, Miss Briggs,\" the Special Agent said politely. \"Any luck,\nMr. Tompkins?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\nHe looked reproachful. \"Oh, come now,\" he pleaded. \"_Something_ must\nhave happened. You got out of Harlem like a bat out of hell and almost\nshook the agent who was tailing you. You don't look to me like nothing\nhappened. Have you filled in that gap? Started to remember anything?\"\n\n\"On my word of honor, Andy,\" I swore, \"I haven't remembered a thing.\nThe gap's still there.\"\n\nHe said nothing for a few minutes and exchanged a glance with\nArthurjean.\n\n\"Something must have happened,\" he requested. \"You've changed. Come\nclean, can't you? I'm only trying to help you.\"\n\n\"I can't tell you much of anything,\" I told him. \"You wouldn't believe\nme if I did. There's been a sort of locked door inside my mind for the\nlast three weeks. Now the door's unlocked and is beginning to swing\nopen. I haven't looked inside, but I think I know what I'll find. I\ncan't tell you more than that now.\"\n\n\"But you're going to look, aren't you?\" he asked.\n\n\"I've got to look,\" I said.\n\nHe sighed. \"Well, we'll just have to keep an eye on you so as to be\naround when you do. See here, Mr. Tompkins, you know your own business\nbut this Von Bieberstein guy is nobody to monkey around with. He's\nplenty tough and he'd as soon kill as sneeze. Can't you give me a hint?\nI'm trained to take those risks and know how to take care of myself,\nand anyhow the Bureau is back of me.\"\n\nI leaned back in my chair and laughed and laughed and laughed until I\nnoticed that both Arthurjean and Harcourt were staring at me without\nsmiling.\n\n\"Sorry,\" I apologized. \"It's just that something struck me as\nrather funny. Well, Arthurjean, I'll be catching the train back to\nWestchester. You and Andy blow yourself to a dinner at my expense. I'll\ngo down to the vet's first thing in the morning and follow your advice.\nGood night, Andy. I'll be seeing you.\"\n\nThat night I locked myself in my bedroom and slept alone. Germaine was\nworried but I put her aside with the explanation that I had a splitting\nheadache--too much to drink, probably, was my explanation. The truth\nwas that I didn't want to see or talk to my wife so that she could not\nguess the perfectly appalling knowledge that had come to me.\n\nThis was insane, I repeated to myself. Even Arthurjean Briggs, who\nhad sworn never to turn me in, had not believed it. Yet no other\nexplanation was open to me. The dog's whole conduct since that fatal\nafternoon of April second was consistent only with the utterly\nirrational theory that the body of the Great Dane had been possessed\nby the soul of Winnie Tompkins at the very moment when the latter's\nbody--now mine--had been possessed by the soul of Frank Jacklin.\n\nEverybody had a fairly nice set of words for the latter\nphenomenon--trauma, schizophrenia, neurasthenia, the Will of God--and\nthe best advice was uniform: forget about it; it will wear off in time;\ntake things easy, you've been working too hard; everybody's crazy.\n\nNow just imagine trying to convince the F.B.I. or a psychiatrist that,\nin addition to this delusion, you know for a fact that a Great Dane\nis now inhabited by the soul that once resided in your own body. I\ncould hear the clanging of the gong on the private ambulance as it\nraced me to the nearest asylum, I could feel my arms already in the\nstrait-jacket. No one must ever know; Arthurjean must never tell. If\nshe doubted me, she must never tell.\n\nThe way I figured it was this: Winnie had been asleep at the Pond Club.\nHe had been worried about Ponto and Ponto was desperately ill--dying\neven--from distemper. Both of their--what was the word?--their _ids_ or\n_psyches_ were relaxed, weakened, off-guard. Then the atomic explosion\nin the Aleutians, by some freak, had hurled my soul half-way around\nthe world into the sleeping body of Winnie Tompkins. His soul had then\ncrowded into the body of Ponto. Ponto's soul--if dogs have them, which\nI don't doubt--was out of luck. Permanently withdrawn.\n\nCrazy? I'll say! I was the only person alive who knew that it was true\nand nobody would ever believe me, if only for the reason that it would\nalways be much simpler to lock me up.\n\nQuite obviously, Ponto knew that he was Winnie and resented my presence\nin his home. He had shown the jealousy and ill-temper natural to a man,\ninstead of the friendliness of a dog. He had been humanly jealous of\nGermaine.\n\nSuddenly I chuckled. By George! this was rich. Winnie in turn\nundoubtedly believed that I was Ponto. The Jacklin angle was outside\nof his range. No wonder he was furious with me when he saw that his\nhousehold pet--a Great Dane--masquerading in his human body, had\nusurped his place in the affections of his wife and in authority over\nhis home. Only hunger, which brings all things to terms, had broken his\nrebellion against this monstrous confusion. It must be tough to find\nyourself reduced to dog-biscuits and runs on the lawn.\n\nI knew what I must do. Arthurjean had been right. The only way I could\nmake myself secure was to have Ponto killed. Would this be murder? I\nwondered what Father Flanagan would make of it. Probably he would say,\n\"Yes, it is murder if you believe that Winfred Tompkins is Ponto.\"\nYet until Ponto was dead, there could be no security for me. At any\nmoment, if the psychiatrists were right, the change might come, with a\nsmall shock, and Winnie Tompkins would resume lawful possession of his\nbody, his home, his wife, his money, while I--Commander Frank Jacklin,\nU.S.N.R.--could count myself lucky to be allowed to sleep on a smelly\nold blanket on the floor in the corner and eat dog-biscuits and be\noffered as a thoroughbred sire.\n\nThere was still time to stop that nonsense. The strictly practical\nthing to do was to go to the kennels first thing in the morning.\nThen I'd take Ponto away from Dalrymple and drive down to White\nPlains and find a vet to give him chloroform. Thus I would be safe\nfrom the possibility of having Winnie reoccupy his body and drive me\ninto Ponto's or, worse still, into the stratosphere to join the mild\nchemical mist that was all that remained of the body of Frank Jacklin.\n\nAll right, it was murder then. I would be murdering Winnie Tompkins,\nbut I would be the only one who would know it--the Perfect Crime. I\nlaughed to myself at the thought that now Harcourt would lose his last\nchance to learn what Winnie had done in that fatal week before Chalmis'\nthorium bomb had blown me and the Alaska into the Aurora Borealis.\n\nAlthough it was a cool night, I was perspiring violently. My nerves\nwere shot to pieces. After this, I would need a rest. Winnie's business\nwas in good shape. I could afford to keep away from the office for\na time, until I grew a new face, as it were, after this shattering\ndiscovery. Then Jimmie and I--perhaps we would have a child. I'd be\ndamned if I'd let my son be a stock-broker with a Great Dane--I might\neven take the Ambassadorship to Canada. The Forbes-Dutton scheme\nsounded too raw even for Washington--it would backfire into another\nTeapot Dome.\n\nI drew a deep breath and relaxed in my bed. My course was plain. First\nof all, I'd attend to Ponto--burn my canine bridges behind me. Then\nI'd take Dr. Folsom at his word and go to the Sanctuary for a couple\nof weeks. My nerves _were_ shot to pieces and if I didn't tell him or\nPendergast Potter about this latest wrinkle in transmigration they\nwould have no reason for detaining me against my will. Oh, yes, I'd\nhave to see that Rutherford got his money. Merry Vail was still in\nHartford, damn him and his nurse! Well, the thing to do was to stop off\nat Rutherford's office on the way to the kennels and give him a check.\nVail could fix up the papers later. Once Ponto was dead, I could relax.\n\n_Was_ it murder? Well, that depended on how you look at it. Certainly,\nI was doing a better job of managing Winnie's life than he had done or\ncould do. Look how I straightened out his mess with women and had made\nGermaine happy for the first time in her life. Look at the killing I\nhad made in Wall Street, three million smackers just by using my head.\nLook at the way I had sold myself to the authorities at Washington,\nexcept for the State Department. The happiness and welfare of too many\npeople now depended on my staying in charge of operations instead of\nWinnie Tompkins. Here, at least, was one case where the end justified\nthe means, and nobody could call it murder.\n\nAnd anyhow, chloroform is an easy death. You choke and gag a bit at\nfirst but then it's all easy, like falling off a log. You just go to\nsleep and never wake up. It would be the kindest possible exit for a\nman who had done no good in the world. I drifted off to sleep.\n\nI awakened with a start, as though a voice had summoned me. The\nmoonlight was streaming through the bedroom window. I knew what I must\ndo. I got out of bed, crossed the room to the clothes-closet, felt over\nin the corner until my fingers found the knot-hole in the smooth pine\nlining. I pressed and there was a click. I reached down and lifted the\nsloping shelf for shoes. There, underneath it, lay a small, neatly\ndocketed file.\n\nThere were many papers and the record went back for years. I switched\non the light and examined the contents of the envelope marked\n\"Thorium.\" It was all there--the ship--the names--the ports--the\nmission. There was documentation on Jacklin. I ran through it. It\nwas accurate and included a specimen of my signature. There was a\ncross-reference to Chalmis and a small file on someone named Kaplansky.\nIrrelevantly included was a folder which contained three cards labeled\n\"Retreat--Holy Week.\" \"St. Michael\" and \"Stations of X!\"\n\nI crossed to the fireplace and put the papers in the grate. For an hour\nI sat there feeding the flames with the record of betrayal and infamy.\nNames, places, dates--I glanced at them, forgot them and burned them\nwith rising exaltation. Thank God! that load was off my conscience.\nI might have to answer for Winnie's sins but I was damned if I'd be\nresponsible for his crimes. And the killing of Ponto was no longer to\nbe murder, it was an execution. For Ponto was Tompkins and Tompkins was\nVon Bieberstein.\n\nDawn was beginning to smudge the windows when the last paper had\nbeen burned and the ashes crushed to fragments beyond the power of\nreconstruction by forensic science. Without Winnie the organization of\nhis gulls and dupes would fall apart and the thing that had been Von\nBieberstein would cease to exist.\n\nAnother thing was clearer, too. Winnie Tompkins had had an obsession\nabout Jacklin. Finally, through some combination of fatigue and mental\nshock, a Jacklin personality had taken control. Call it schizophrenia,\nJekyll-and-Hyde, or whatever, there was a fair chance that I was still\nWinnie, but his better self. The dog had been another obsession. The\ndog was to blame? Well, if I believed it, it might be true, like the\nold scape-goat system. I was physically the same man who had been Von\nBieberstein and had blown up the Alaska, planting evidence that would\nthrow the blame on Jacklin. In my heart and spirit, it was as though I\nhad been recreated. All the evidence had been destroyed.\n\nI switched off the light and returned to bed. I fell asleep almost at\nonce, for now I knew that I would be safe and that Germaine would be\nsafe. There was no record left and soon Ponto, too, would be gone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 33\n\n\nWednesday, the twenty-fifth, dawned bright and fair. My mind was fully\nmade up and I was feeling fine. Germaine was still anxious about me\nat breakfast but I soon convinced her that there was nothing serious\ninvolved. I laughed secretly as I said it.\n\n\"You know,\" I told her, \"I think I'll drive over to Hartford and have\nthose people at the Sanctuary look me over again. I think I need some\nkind of rest--the reaction, you know.\"\n\nMy wife raised no objection. In fact, she seemed rather relieved as\nthough my aloof conduct of the previous night had been a shock to her\nself-confidence.\n\n\"I'll stop off at the kennels on my way over,\" I added, \"just to make\nsure that Ponto is all right.\"\n\nMy plan was to remove the dog and drive to White Plains. Then, if there\nwas any issue raised as to my need for a rest-cure, it would appear\nthat I had inexplicably ordered my favorite dog chloroformed. That\nwould clinch it with Germaine as nothing else could.\n\nShe seemed rather subdued as she went upstairs and helped me pack my\nthings in a suitcase. She did not offer to kiss me good-bye as I drove\nthe Packard out of the garage and rolled around the graveled drive\ntoward my road to freedom.\n\nFirst, of course, I stopped at Dr. Rutherford's office. It was early\nin the morning and he hadn't finished breakfast. The maid admitted me\nto the reception-room and while waiting for him, I made out a check\nfor fifteen thousand dollars to the order of Jeremiah Rutherford, and\nmarked across the back, \"For Professional Services.\"\n\n\"Here you are, Jerry,\" I informed him when he finally appeared. \"I\nwould have got it to you sooner except that my lawyer went off the deep\nend with a girl in Hartford. He should have had the papers ready on\nMonday and here it is Wednesday.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said briefly. \"Are you feeling okay?\" he asked. \"You look\na bit shaky.\"\n\nI laughed. \"Set it down to my liver,\" I told him. \"I had a wet night\nlast night and am a little rocky this morning. As a matter of fact, I\nthink I'll run over the The Sanctuary and ask Folsom to put me up for a\nfew days. My nerves are shot to hell.\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" he murmured absently. \"I'll go down to the bank and put\nthis in for collection. My Army papers came through yesterday and I'm\nall set.\"\n\nI climbed into my car and tooled along the roads until, after inquiring\nat a couple of filling stations, I located Dalrymple's kennels.\n\n\"I've come for Ponto,\" I told the vet.\n\nDalrymple seemed rather embarrassed. \"Are you sure you need him?\"\nhe asked. \"He's just served Buglebell III--that's the prize-winning\nbrindle bitch owned by one of the Fortune editors--and I was planning--\"\n\n\"You can cancel your plans,\" I informed him. \"And as for Buglebell's\npups, I'll buy the litter. What _were_ your other plans, anyhow?\"\n\nDalrymple was quite abashed. \"Not exactly anything, Mr. Tompkins,\nsir,\" he said. \"It was only that--\"\n\nI nodded majestically. \"Once is enough,\" I said, \"and you can be\nthankful I don't report you to the Kennel Club for bootlegging\nthoroughbred puppies. Ponto comes with me--now.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, Mr. Tompkins,\" the vet agreed humbly.\n\nDalrymple was a broken man but Ponto was not a broken dog. However,\nmarriage coming so soon after distemper had curbed his spirit and he\nslouched into the Packard.\n\nAs soon as I was out on the main road again, I stepped on the\naccelerator, heading the car southward in the general direction of\nWhite Plains.\n\nPonto sat panting on the seat beside me, but in his weary eye I saw\nall the Westchester stock-brokers who had ever annoyed me. I also saw\nWinnie, and Winnie was to die.\n\nI admit that I was day-dreaming a bit as I rounded the turn. In any\ncase, I was driving fast and had not fully accustomed myself to\nhandling the Packard. The other automobile backed violently out of the\ndriveway on the right, the dope of a driver not looking to see if there\nwas any traffic coming. I slapped my foot down on the brake, missed\nand hit the accelerator. The Packard gave a wild leap ahead. The other\ncar--a battered old Chevrolet--completely blocked the road. I jammed on\nthe hand-brake and twisted the steering gear so that the Packard ran up\nthe bank of an elderly apple-tree. My head snapped forward, there was a\nblinding flash and then complete blackness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeconds or centuries later I opened my eyes. The old Chevy seemed to\nhave pulled away and was now parked ahead of us along the righthand\nside of the road. My wind-shield had not shattered and, so far as I\ncould see, no major damage had been done to my car though I hated to\nthink of the fenders. I ached in every limb.\n\nMy neck itched intolerably so I scratched it with my left leg. I shook\nmyself. \"Well, I'll be damned!\" I exclaimed, only to hear a deep growl\nthat seemed to originate from within my hairy chest.\n\nI glanced over my shoulder. There, in the seat beside me, hunched\nforward over the steering-wheel, sat a heavy-built man, a thin trickle\nof blood sliding down his cheek, his eyes closed and his lips open,\nwhile he snorted with concussion.\n\nInstinctively, I called for help. My reward was a series of loud,\nangry barks. Again my ear itched and I scratched it again with my left\nleg. It seemed that I had become a dog. The man beside me stirred and\nmoaned. Then he opened his eyes.\n\n\"Ponto,\" he said dreamily. \"Good dog!\"\n\nThe driver of the other car walked back and was standing by the window.\n\n\"You all right, mister?\" he asked. \"You was doing fifty easy. Lucky for\nyou I see you coming.\"\n\nThe man in the driver's seat gave a feeble smile. \"My fault,\" he\nadmitted. \"I was day-dreaming. Lucky this heap has good brakes. Are you\nall right? Any damage, I mean?\"\n\nThe other man laughed. \"Sure,\" he said. \"I'll go on now, just so\nyou're all right. Want a doc?\"\n\n\"Uh-uh!\" the man on the seat beside me shook his head. \"My name's\nTompkins and I live in Bedford Hills. If there's any damage, it's my\nfault and I'll pay for it. Sure you're okay?\"\n\n\"Yep!\" agreed the owner of the Chevrolet. \"You got a cut or something.\nReckon you'd ought to see a doc.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said the man beside me. \"Don't worry. I'll be all right. Just\nbumped my head a bit.\"\n\nWe waited until the Chevrolet had rattled itself around the turn of the\nroad. Then the man cautiously tried the gears and disinfiltrated the\nPackard from the apple-tree. He got out and inspected the car carefully\nfor damage and then climbed back behind the steering-wheel. I started\nto ask him a question. It was a whine.\n\n\"Why Ponto!\" he exclaimed. \"You old black devil. How are you, hound?\nLong time no see.\"\n\n\"Hot damn!\" he exclaimed, after a pause. \"Have I been on a _drunk_! You\nknow, Ponto, I dreamed that I was you and if there's anything in dreams\nI bet I'm the only Republican in Westchester County that ever married a\nbrindle bitch named Buglebell.\n\n\"Let's see,\" he continued. \"Where were we? Earlier today I went to the\nPond Club and had a couple of drinks. How in hell do I find myself\nhere? I must have drawn one hell of a blank, Ponto, the damndest blank\nI've ever drawn in my life.\"\n\nHis eyes looked down on the seat beside us, where I had left a copy of\nthe morning New York Times.\n\n\"Hullo!\" he exclaimed. \"That's funny. Here it is. Good Lord! the\ntwenty-fifth of April! So I've been out for three weeks. That is a\nblank to end all blanks.\"\n\nHe whistled tunelessly between his teeth. Then he cast a glance toward\nthe back seat, where my suitcase rested.\n\n\"What gives,\" he inquired. \"I'm not leaving home, for God's sake?\nPonto, old boy, you just stick by me and we'll go back to the house and\nsee what this is all about.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I barked at him.\n\n\"That's a good dog,\" he said affably. \"That's a good Ponto.\"\n\nHe backed the Packard into the driveway that had been my nemesis and\nturned the car around.\n\nAs we approached the house he slowed the car to a dead stop.\n\n\"Ponto,\" he told me. \"Here's where you and I go into a committee of the\nwhole. What's been going on around here? There's been one hell of a\nmix-up if you ask me. I had a dream--\"\n\nThe sooner I got his mind off this subject the safer I would be. I laid\nmy ears back and woofed.\n\n\"Attaboy!\" he agreed. \"Now let's take a look at this paper.... What?\nRoosevelt's dead? Why doesn't anybody tell me these things? And\nGermany's about to flop? Whew! Who would have dreamed it? You know,\nhound, I feel like Rip Van Winkle coming back after twenty years sleep.\"\n\nI tried to look ingratiating and let my tongue loll fetchingly out of\nthe side of my mouth.\n\n\"Say!\" he exclaimed harshly. \"Now it's beginning to come back. You\ntook my place while I was--God! have _you_ ever been introduced to\na great big dog and told she's your wife? Well, damn it! you and\nJimmie--Oh, hell, this is one godawful mess! What's been happening\naround here, anyhow? Am I going nuts?\"\n\nI pricked up my ears and gave a false, loving whine. I licked his\nstinking hands.\n\n\"Okay, okay,\" Winnie agreed. \"It's not your fault. But what the hell\nhappened is beyond me. I hate to think of those prime asses, Phil and\nGraham, in this market. And what happened to Virginia? That's one gal\nyou didn't know about, Ponto. She's for me, and how!\"\n\nHe took another look at the paper.\n\n\"Oh, the hell with it!\" he growled. \"If Jimmie doesn't like it, she\nknows what she can do about it. Let's go on home, Ponto, and just tell\nher man-to-man where she gets off.\"\n\nI barked.\n\nHe put his foot on the accelerator and whirled up the drive to come to\na stop in front of Pook's Hill.\n\nBefore he had switched off the engine, the front door opened and\nGermaine appeared.\n\n\"Heavens!\" she exclaimed, \"you're back early. Have you changed your\nmind again?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" Winnie said. \"I decided to come back home, after all.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"I'm glad,\" she told him. \"I couldn't make out why you were\nso keen to go back to Hartford so soon after you got out. You come on\nin, darling, and Myrtle and I will take care of you. Gracious! There's\nblood on your cheek. Did you hurt yourself?\"\n\nHer voice was warm and loving and made my hair rise slightly. If he\ntried any monkey-business with her, I'd rip his throat out. I growled.\n\n\"Oh, good!\" she laughed. \"You got Ponto. Did he have a nice honeymoon,\npoor darling? Is Dalrymple satisfied? Would you like to put in for one\nof the pups?\"\n\nI growled again.\n\nShe laughed. \"Oh, Winnie, he looks so shattered. He--what _did_ happen\nto your head, darling?\"\n\nHe grinned. \"We almost had an accident. I was headed towards the\nParkway when a car backed out. We bumped into an apple-tree. No harm\ndone but I was knocked out for a few minutes and I guess it must have\nshaken me up.\"\n\nShe lifted her face to his and kissed him until I could feel thick, hot\nrage mount inside my throat and force itself out in a deep rumbling\ngrowl.\n\n\"Look,\" she said, \"he's jealous. Poor Ponto!\"\n\nAnd she kneeled beside me, put her arm around my neck and pressed my\nhead affectionately.\n\n\"There!\" she said briskly. \"You're a good dog. You're my Ponto and I'll\ntake care of you.\"\n\nTompkins glowered at me and her.\n\n\"Stop driveling over that damn dog,\" he said, \"and come on into the\nhouse.\"\n\nGermaine gave me a farewell pat on the head.\n\n\"He's such a good dog,\" she announced, \"and now that he's been properly\nmarried he'll settle down, I hope. I've been quite worried over the way\nhe's been acting. But it's all right now, Ponto, isn't it? Was your\ngirl-friend nice, old boy? Huh? Are you happy?\"\n\nI tried to explain things but all that came to my lips was a series of\nwhines and growls.\n\n\"Come along, Jimmie,\" Tompkins insisted. \"I'm cold. Damn it all! I've\nhad a shock and all you can think of doing is to slobber over a dog.\nLet him have a run.\"\n\nSo she got off her knees and followed him obediently into the house.\n\nI sat for a moment, pondering my predicament.\n\nThis was Fate. Three seconds would have made all the difference but\nhere I was, a dog. Conditions were reversed and I might as well be\nphilosophical about it. Winnie never dreamed that conditions were not\nas they had been before the second of April, just as though Frank\nJacklin had never existed. The chances were that he would continue to\nbelieve that it was all a dream, an hallucination. As for the F.B.I.\nand Von Bieberstein, putting first things first, that was no longer\nany of my business. Dogs were not expected to develop patriotism: that\nluxury was reserved for human beings. All I could do now was to wait\nmy chance. Perhaps the time would come when I could repossess Winnie\nTompkins' body. Then, by George! I would not waste one minute but would\nhave him chloroformed at once. In the meantime, my cue was to be a good\ndog.\n\nThere was a shrill whistle from the house.\n\n\"Ponto!\" Winnie's voice called. \"Come here, Ponto. That's a good dog!\nCome on, Ponto! That's a good dog!\"\n\nI ran, wagging my tail, to the open door and on all fours entered the\nhouse I had left only two hours before as its proud master.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 34\n\n\nI was lying down in the kitchen, near the stove, on an old rug which\nMary-Myrtle had spread for me. She was really a nice girl. My educated\nnose informed me that she was kind, young and affectionate. When\nshe entered the room I used to rear up and place my forepaws on her\nshoulders and lick her ears. She liked me. She used to put her arms\naround my neck and press against me and give me a smack on the back and\na \"Go on with you, can't you see I'm busy?\"\n\nI was lying by the stove when Winnie Tompkins entered the kitchen.\nMary-Myrtle was bending over the stove, fussing with a saucepan of\nvegetables. I was quietly sniffing with interest the combination of\ncooking-smells and the scents from the warm spring afternoon. Winnie\nstrolled across the kitchen, took his thumb and forefinger and gave her\na hard pinch on her buttock.\n\n\"Oh! God!\" she shrieked and turned to confront him. \"Oh, you!\" she\nobserved. \"I thought you'd got over all that!\"\n\nHe whistled between his teeth, put one tweed-clad arm around her\nshoulders and pressed her to him.\n\n\"Go on!\" she said, in a half-whisper. \"I'll call Mrs. Tompkins.\"\n\nStill whistling, with his free hand he tilted her chin up to his face,\nstooped over and kissed her. I could see her hands flutter and press\nagainst his chest for a moment, then relax, then clutch him fiercely,\nas her lips thrust against his mouth. I rose and growled.\n\n\"Hello!\" Winnie exclaimed. \"Why if it isn't Ponto? You jealous again,\nold boy? We can't have a moralist around here, can we, Myrtle?\"\n\nHe turned and kissed her again.\n\nI stalked over and stood, rumbling a bit, beside her, ready to attack\nif he carried his dalliance beyond decorum.\n\n\"Let me go, sir,\" Myrtle begged in a hoarse whisper.\n\n\"Tonight?\" he asked, holding her close.\n\n\"Yes,\" she sighed. \"I'll come down, sir. Tonight, when the dishes are\ndone and the house asleep.\"\n\nHe snapped his fingers at me, with an air of assured authority. \"Come\non, Ponto,\" he commanded.\n\nI followed him with murder in my heart, my toe-nails clicking on the\nparquet floor, my tail wagging with slow servility. He led the way\nupstairs to my wife's bedroom. He tapped on the door.\n\n\"Come in,\" Germaine called. \"And here's Ponto!\"\n\nI padded across the room to the chaise longue and lay down beside her.\nI gave her silk-clad leg a poke with my nose. She smelled lovely.\n\n\"Thank you, Ponto,\" she said courteously.\n\nI rested my head on my paws and looked at Winnie. He absent-mindedly\npulled a cigar out of his pocket, bit off the tip and lighted it,\nafter spitting the shreds of tobacco in the general direction of the\nfireplace. I could feel Germaine go tense.\n\n\"I'm so glad you decided not to go to Hartford after all,\" she remarked\nquietly. \"It's much nicer for you here. Myrtle and I can take care of\nyou and see that you have a good rest. Poor darling, you must need one.\"\n\nWinnie blew a heavy puff of smoke toward her bed-canopy. I could tell\nby the way he answered her that he was feeling his way.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he agreed. \"I might as well get a sample of this far-famed\nsuburban home-life you read about.\"\n\nShe jumped up and put her arms around his neck.\n\n\"It's not so bad, is it, Winnie?\" she asked gently. \"You know--I\nsuppose it's silly to tell such things--but last night I dreamed we\nwere going to have a baby.\"\n\n\"Good Lord, Jimmie!\" he drawled. \"I hope not. You know as well as I do\nthat we aren't the kind of people who have kids. If you think there's\nany danger of it, there's a doctor I know in New York who'll put a good\nstop to it.\"\n\nGermaine's hand fluttered helplessly at her breast and her face went\nwhite and peaked. A sharp whiff of the acrid sense of human anger and\nfear came from her body. I rose and eyed Winnie steadily. I was careful\nnot to growl.\n\n\"Why, I thought--\" she began. \"The other night, I mean, it was all\nso--What's the matter? What has changed?\"\n\nHe gave a sort of neighing laugh. \"Oh nuts, Jimmie! We aren't the\ntype. Say it's spring or what-have-you? Just for that are you going to\ngo through hell just to have a little animal that will go 'Aah-Aah-Aah'\nat you?\"\n\nGermaine stood up. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I am. If that's the way these\nthings happen, that's what I want. If it doesn't happen I never want\nto see you again so long as I live. But if it does, it will be _my_\nbusiness, not yours. I want this baby. You loved me the other night.\nYou needed me. We needed each other. I can't throw that away, like\na--like a dead cigar butt.\"\n\nHe thrust his cigar into the corner of his mouth, a la Churchill. \"So\nthat's the way it is, is it?\" he demanded. \"Okay, but how am I expected\nto know that it wasn't Jerry Rutherford--\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Germaine looked at him in utter, white-lipped silence. \"You know\nthat can't be true.\"\n\nAfter a minute she spoke to him quite gently.\n\n\"Winnie,\" she told him, \"you know, I think you really ought to go to\nthe Sanctuary, as you planned. You do need a rest, dear, and it would\nbe better if you took it there where they have trained attendants and\ngood doctors. I'll be waiting here till you come back. Do go, darling.\nIt will do you a world of good. Everything will work out for us all\nright now.\"\n\n\"So you want to railroad me to an asylum, eh?\" he snarled. \"Well, nuts\nto that! As far as I'm concerned, we're back on the old basis. You go\nyour way and I go mine. And no brats, mind you! or I'll call the whole\nthing off. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Yes, Winnie,\" Germaine replied, in a small, frightened voice. \"You\nmake yourself perfectly clear.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" he told her. \"Come on, Ponto!\"\n\nHe had the nerve to snap his fingers at me. Not even when I had him\nin the Packard, headed for White Plains and chloroform, had he stood\nnearer death, but Germaine's hand--cold and little--rested briefly on\nmy ears and I mastered my rage.\n\nI followed him into his bedroom and he slammed the door behind me.\n\n\"See here, you black son of a bitch,\" he truthfully addressed me. \"You\nseem to have made one hell of a mess of my affairs. Oh, I don't suppose\nyou can understand me now that you're a dog again, but just the same,\nfor two cents I'd send you to the boneyard. I've still to find out how\nmuch hell you've been raising with my business, but damn it all!!!\nCouldn't you _tell_ that it didn't suit my plans to be clubby with\nJimmie?\"\n\nI padded loyally across the bedroom and laid my head on his lap. He\nmilked my ears automatically and I rejoiced, because the more he\nthought of me as Ponto the less likely he was to discover my human\npersonality. I had not yet decided when to kill him.\n\n\"Yes, damn it! hound,\" Winnie continued. \"This is one thing the\nexperts will never know about. It's out of this world. Three weeks as\nan involuntary Great Dane, ending up in a shot-gun marriage with a\nbig brindle bitch named Buglebell III! If you want to know my idea of\nshooting ducks in a rain-barrel, that is it. No privacy at all. Just\nan old boy writing things down in the stud-book. Jimmie may think I'm\nmean but after that experience who wants off-spring, cannon-fodder or\nkennel-fodder? I don't. Neither would you, Ponto. I suppose,\" he added,\n\"that legally speaking you are the putative father, not me. Gosh! what\nan experience!\"\n\nHe reached over to the night-table and pulled the brandy-bottle out\nfrom the little cupboard, which was neatly fitted out with glasses,\nbottle-openers, a syphon and a decanter. He glared accusingly at the\nbottle.\n\n\"Damn you!\" he exclaimed, \"It's almost gone. My best brandy! Whoever\ntold you you could touch my liquor? Oh, well, can't say that I blame\nyou. Here, I'll let you smell the cork.\"\n\nHe held it out at me and I sniffed it dutifully. I jumped back,\nsneezing.\n\n\"Not so keen about it, eh?\" he demanded gruffly. \"Well, just to even up\nthe score I'll make you drink some.\"\n\nHe grabbed my lower jaw with his free hand and forced my tender lips\nagainst my sharp teeth until I opened my mouth. Then he poured some of\nit down my throat. I choked, but got it down.\n\n\"Atta dog!\" he praised me. \"Now you just stick around and you'll see\nsome fun.\"\n\nHe went out and closed the door, leaving me alone in the darkened room.\n\nAn hour or so later, the door reopened and Winnie swaggered in. He\nlooked slightly more bloated than before and his eyes were glazed with\nliquor. He tossed off his clothes, went to the bathroom and took a hot\nshower. Then he lighted a cigar and lay on his bed, in his dressing\ngown, waiting--\n\nAfter a while there was a quiet step in the hall and the click of\nthe door-handle. It was Mary-Myrtle. She was wearing a red flannel\ndressing-gown and her hair was done up in a pigtail. She closed the\ndoor behind her and cast an anxious glance over her shoulder in the\ndirection of the hall.\n\nTompkins guffawed. \"Who? Jimmie?\" he demanded. \"Not her! She knows\nbetter than to interfere.\"\n\nMyrtle cast strange little embarrassed glances to right and left and\nI noted that her hands were trembling as they fumbled at the buttons\nof her dressing-gown. I strolled across to her and sniffed the sharp\nperfume of desire on her limbs.\n\nShe gave a little squeak. \"Oh, Ponto! You gave me such a start.\" She\nturned to Winnie. \"Take him away,\" she said. \"It doesn't seem decent\nwith him watching.\"\n\nHe gave a loose lipped smile and rolled off the bed.\n\n\"Ponto,\" he ordered. \"You're de trop. Get the hell out of here!\"\n\nHe opened the door to the hall and I slunk out into the darkness of\nthe landing. My toes clicked their way across to the door of my wife's\nbedroom. I lay down, on guard, my ear cocked to catch the desperate\nstifled sobs of the woman inside.\n\nIt was then that I decided that Tompkins must die.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 35\n\n\nMy opportunity to settle the account did not present itself for more\nthan twenty-four hours. Early the following morning, Myrtle was kicked\nout and crept upstairs. Winnie slammed the door and snored like a hog\nuntil ten o'clock--at which time he stamped downstairs and roared for\nbreakfast.\n\nAfter he had eaten, he went to his room again, shutting me outside,\nand dressed himself carefully in the manly tweeds he had been wearing\non that first day in the Pond Club. He drove to the station--I\nassumed--leaving me behind at Pook's Hill with two unhappy women.\nHe did not return that evening at all and it wasn't until late the\nfollowing morning--that would be Saturday I figured, although I was\nalready losing my human preoccupation with time--that I recognized the\ncrunch of the Packard's tires on the graveled drive. I was standing\njust inside the door as I heard his key fumbling in the lock.\n\nIt was Winnie and he was drunk.\n\n\"Oh, hullo, Ponto,\" he remarked thickly. \"So you're the welcoming\ncommittee. Come on up with me, boy, and hear the dirt.\"\n\nI followed his uncertain steps upstairs and into the bedroom. It would\nnot be long now.\n\n\"Ponto!\" he announced. \"Good old Ponto, Ponto! I'm going to tell you a\ngreat secret. You won't tell anybody about it, will you? You can't.\"\n\nI lay on the rug and panted at him.\n\n\"Yes, Ponto, if you're going to play ball with me you got to be one\ntough dog. Took a run into New York today and is that one mad-house?\nSaw Virginia. You know, red-head. She knows her stuff. Had me right\nback on my five-yard line before I rallied and scored that touchdown.\nIt was terrific. Called my office. We're rich, boy, rich as hell.\"\n\n\"Thissa tough game, dog. That Briggs gal says the F.B.I.'s still\nworrying about me. Is that a laugh, hey, Ponto? Is that a laugh! She\nsays they wanna know do I remember the week before Easter. Hell! could\nI forget it? Maybe it's lucky for me I drew that blank. Might of had\ntough job ducking the G-men.\n\n\"Aw, they're nuts! I agree, Ponto, I must respectfully agree with you.\nDidja hear me contradict anybody? It's a lead-pipe cinch, fooling those\nbabies. Where was I the week before Easter? And sure I was tucked away\nin a Catholic Retreat at the Seminary of the Sacred Heart, doing the\nStations of the Cross in St. Michael's Church. Great institution--the\nStations of the Cross. Wonderful institution. You can meet anyone and\nno questions asked. I gave the instructions that sent the Alaska to\nthe bottom of the North Pacific and slipped the black spot to that sap\nJacklin between the Scourging and the Crown of Thorns. Lucky thing I\nknew all about him. Helped. It was easy, Ponto, easy. Who's to question\na man doing Stations of the Cross if somebody else does 'em at the same\ntime?\"\n\nHe paused and poured a brandy.\n\n\"Tha' red-head's a wonder, Ponto,\" he told me. \"She deals 'em straight\nand plays 'em close to her chest. For three weeks she followed my\nlead without a peep. I was out like a light. Can't remember a thing\nbut she never let on. I always said the way to _act_ innocent was to\n_be_ innocent. Not that she knows what it is all about. She thinks\nI'm playing the Black Market. She's a racketeer at heart, she is, the\ntramp. That North Pacific job was no cinch, Ponto. All I had to do was\nto kidnap that guy Chalmis and substitute a ringer. Old Chalmis? We\ndropped him in the High Rockies on the flight to Seattle. The Navy was\na bunch of saps, letting my men take that plane. Sure, we dropped the\nNavy boys too, along with Chalmis.\"\n\nI sat, ears pricked up, watching him. I could see the throb of the\nartery in his throat that marked the place for my teeth to meet.\n\n\"Virginia told me the G-men are looking for Von Bieberstein,\" Tompkins\nsaid. \"Hell, Ponto, even she doesn't know what happened back in '35.\nSure I was broke. Sure fifty thousand would bail me out. Sure Hitler\nput up the fifty thousand. He saved my hide. I made a killing all\nright. So I'm Von Bieberstein? So what, Ponto, so what! Want to make\nanything of it? Sure I lived up to my end of the bargain. Roosevelt\nhad ruined me. What did I owe Roosevelt? Sure I took the job. And was\n_that_ a laugh! The F.B.I. chasing all over the place for Kurt Von\nBieberstein, and all the time it's little old Winnie Tompkins, Harvard\n1920 and good old one thousand per cent American stock. The poor boobs\nthink they've licked Hitler, Ponto, but he's really licked them. You\nwait'n see. I'll still be Gauleiter of Westchester County, so help me!\"\n\nThe moment had come. He was lolling back on his bed, his arms behind\nhis head, his neck exposed. I gathered my muscles and leaped for his\nthroat.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Rat Race, by Jay Franklin\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RAT RACE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51854-8.txt or 51854-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/8/5/51854/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
