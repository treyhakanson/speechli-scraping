A kind you might\n     not think to look for....\n\n\nIllustrated by Schelling\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n     _Walking home in the dark from an evening spent in mischief, a\n     young man spied coming toward him down the road a person with\n     a lamp. When the wayfarers drew abreast, the play-boy saw that\n     the other traveler was the Blind Man from his village. \"Blind\n     Man,\" the youngster shouted across the road, \"what a fool you\n     be! Why, old No-Eyes, do you bear a lantern, you whose midnight\n     is no darker than his noonday?\" The Blind Man lifted his lamp.\n     \"It is not as a light for myself that I carry this, Boy,\" he\n     said, \"it is to warn off you fools with eyes.\"_\n\n     --_Hausa proverb_\n\n\n\nThe Captain shook hands with the black-hatted Amishman while the woman\nstood aside, not concerning herself with men's business. \"It's been a\npleasure to have you and _Fraa_ Stoltzfoos aboard, Aaron,\" the Captain\nsaid. \"Ship's stores are yours, my friend; if there's anything you need,\ntake it and welcome. You're a long way from the corner grocery.\"\n\n\"My Martha and I have all that's needful,\" Aaron Stoltzfoos said. \"We\nhave our plow, our seed, our land. Captain, please tell your men, who\ntreated us strangers as honored guests, we thank them from our hearts.\nWe'll not soon forget their kindness.\"\n\n\"I'll tell them,\" the Captain promised. Stoltzfoos hoisted himself to\nthe wagon seat and reached a hand down to boost his wife up beside him.\nMartha Stoltzfoos sat, blushing a bit for having displayed an accidental\ninch of black stocking before the ship's officers. She smoothed down her\nblack skirts and apron, patted the candle-snuffer _Kapp_ into place over\nher prayer-covering, and tucked the wool cape around her arms and\nshoulders. The world outside, her husband said, was a cold one.\n\nNow in the Stoltzfoos wagon was the final lot of homestead goods with\nwhich these two Amishers would battle the world of Murna. There was the\nplow and bags of seed, two crates of nervous chickens; a huge, round\ntabletop; an alcohol-burning laboratory incubator, bottles of\nagar-powder, and a pressure cooker that could can vegetables as readily\nas it could autoclave culture-media. There was a microscope designed to\nwork by lamplight, as the worldly vanity of electric light would ill\nsuit an Old Order bacteriologist like Martha Stoltzfoos. Walled in by\nall this gear was another passenger due to debark on Murna, snuffling\nand grunting with impatience. \"_Sei schtill_, Wutzchen,\" Stoltzfoos\ncrooned. \"You'll be in your home pen soon enough.\"\n\nThe Captain raised his hand. The Engineer punched a button to tongue the\nlanding ramp out to Murnan earth. Cold air rammed in from the outside\nwinter. The four horses stomped their hoofs on the floor-plates, their\nbreath spikes of steam. Wutzchen squealed dismay as the chill hit his\nnose.\n\n\"We're _reddi far geh_, Captain,\" Stoltzfoos said. \"My woman and I\ninvite you and your men to feast at our table when you're back in these\nparts, five years hence. We'll stuff you fat as sausages with onion\nsoup and Pannhaas, Knepp and Ebbelkuche, shoo-fly pie and _scharifer_\ncider, if the folk here grow apples fit for squeezing.\"\n\n\"You'll have to set up planks outdoors to feed the lot I'll be bringing,\nAaron,\" the Captain said. \"Come five-years' springtime, when I bring\nyour Amish neighbors out, I'll not forget to have in my pockets a toot\nof candy for the little Stoltzes I'll expect to see underfoot.\" Martha,\nwhose English was rusty, blushed none the less. Aaron grinned as he\nslapped the reins over the rumps of his team. \"Giddap!\" The cart rumbled\nacross the deck and down the ramp, onto the soil of Murna. Yonnie, the\nAyrshire bull, tossed his head and sat as the rope tightened on his\nnoseband. He skidded stubbornly down the ramp till he felt cold earth\nagainst his rear. Accepting fate, Yonnie scrambled up and plodded after\nthe wagon. As the Stoltzfooses and the last of their off-worldly goods\ntopped a hillock, they both turned to wave at the ship's officers. Then,\nveiled by the dusty fall of snow, they disappeared.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I don't envy them,\" the Engineer said, staring out into the wintery\nworld.\n\n\"Hymie, were you born in a barn?\" the Exec bellowed.\n\n\"Sorry, sir.\" The Engineer raised the landing ramp. Heaters hummed to\nthaw the hold's air. \"I was thinking about how alone those two folks are\nnow.\"\n\n\"Hardly alone,\" the Captain said. \"There are four million Murnans,\nfriendly people who consider a white skin no more than a personal\nidiosyncrasy. Aaron's what his folks call a _Chentelmaan_, too. He'll\nget along.\"\n\n\"Chentelmaan-schmentelmaan,\" the Engineer said. \"Why'd he come half\nacross Creation to scratch out a living with a horse-drawn plow?\"\n\n\"He came out here for dirt,\" the Captain said. \"Soil is more than\nseed-bed to the Amish. It feeds the Old Order they're born to. Aaron\nand Martha Stoltzfoos would rather have built their barns beside the\nSusquehanna, but all the land there's taken. Aaron could have taken a\njob in Lancaster, too; he could have shaved off his beard, bought a\nChevie and moved to the suburbs, and settled down to read an\nEnglish-language Bible in a steepled church. Instead, he signed a\nhomestead-contract for a hundred acres eighty light-years from home; and\nset out to plow the land like his grandpop did. He'll sweat hard for his\npiece of Murna, but the Amish always pay well for their land.\"\n\n\"And what do we, the government, I mean, get from the deal?\" the Exec\nwanted to know. \"This wagon of ours doesn't run on hay, like Aaron's\ndoes.\"\n\n\"Cultures skid backwards when they're transplanted,\" the Captain said.\n\"Murnan culture was lifted from Kano, a modern city by the standards of\nthe time; but, without tools and with a population too small to support\ntechnology, the West African apostates from Islam who landed here four\nhundred years ago slid back to the ways of their grandparents. We want\nthem to get up to date again. We want Murna to become a market. That's\nAaron's job. Our Amishman has got to start this planet back toward the\nmachine age.\"\n\n\"Seems an odd job to give a fellow who won't drive a car or read by\nelectric light,\" the Engineer observed.\n\n\"Not so odd,\" the Captain said. \"The Amish pretty much invented American\nagriculture, you know. They've developed the finest low-energy farming\nthere is. Clover-growing, crop-rotation, using animal manures, those are\ntheir inventions. Aaron, by his example, will teach the natives here\nPennsylvania farming. Before you can say Tom Malthus, there'll be steel\ncities in this wilderness, filled with citizens eager to open charge\naccounts for low-gravs and stereo sets.\"\n\n\"You expect our bearded friend to reap quite a harvest, Captain,\" the\nEngineer said. \"I just hope the natives here let him plant the seed.\"\n\n\"Did you get along with him, Hymie?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" the Engineer said. \"Aaron even made our smiths, those human\nsharks bound for Qureysh, act friendly. For all his strange ways, he's a\nnice guy.\"\n\n\"Nice guy, hell,\" the Captain said. \"He's a genius. That\nseventeenth-century un-scientist has more feeling for folkways in his\ncalloused left hand than you'd find in all the Colonial Survey. How do\nyou suppose the Old Order maintains itself in Pennsylvania, a tiny\nDeitsch-speaking enclave surrounded by calico suburbs and ten-lane\nhighways? They mind their business and leave the neighbors to theirs.\nThe Amish have never been missionaries--they learned in 1600 that\nmissionaries are resented, and either slaughtered or absorbed.\"\n\n\"Sometimes digestively,\" the Engineer remarked.\n\n\"Since the Thirty Years' War, back when 'Hamlet' was opening in London,\nthese people have been breeding a man who can fit one special niche in\nsociety. The failures were killed in the early days, or later went gay\nand took the trappings of the majority. The successes stayed on the\nfarm, respected and left alone. Aaron has flirted with our century; he\nand his wife learned some very un-Amish skills at the Homestead School.\nThe skill that makes Aaron worth his fare out here, though, is an Amish\nskill, and the rarest one of all. He knows the Right Way to Live, and\nlives it; but he knows, too, that your Truth-of-the Universe is\nsomething different. And right, for you. He's quite a man, our Aaron\nStoltzfoos. That's why we dropped him here.\"\n\n\"Better him than me,\" the Engineer said.\n\n\"Precisely,\" the Captain said. He turned to the Exec. \"As soon as we've\nlifted, ask Colonel Harris to call on me in my cabin, Gene. Our Marines\nhad better fresh-up their swordsmanship and cavalry tactics if they're\nto help our Inad Tuaregs establish that foundry on Qureysh.\"\n\n\"It sometimes seems you're more Ship's Anthropologist than Captain,\" the\nEngineer remarked.\n\n\"I'm an anthro-apologist, Hymie, like Mr. Kipling,\" the Captain said.\n\"_There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays.\nAnd--every--single--one--of--them--is--right!_\" Bells rang, and the ship\nsurged. \"Aaron and Martha, God keep you,\" the Captain said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Whoa!\" Aaron shouted. He peered back toward the ship, floating up into\ngrayness, the cavitation of her wake stirring the snow into patterns\nlike fine-veined marble. \"_Gott saygen eich_,\" he said, a prayer for his\ndeparting friends.\n\nHis wife shivered. \"It's cold enough to freeze the horns off a\nmooley-cow,\" she said. She glanced about at the snow-drifted little\ntrees and clutched her black cloak tighter. \"I'm feared, Stoltz. There's\nnaught about us now but snow and black heathen.\"\n\n\"It's fear that is the heathen,\" Aaron said. \"_By the word of the Lord\nwere the heavens made; and the host of them by the breath of His\nmouth._\" He kissed her. \"I welcome you to our new homeland, wife,\" he\nsaid.\n\nBehind them Wutzchen--\"piglet\"--grunted. Martha smiled back at the giant\nporker, perched amongst the cases and bags and household goods like the\nvictim of some bawdy chiavari. \"I've never heard a pig mutter so,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"If he knew that his business here was to flatter the local lady-pigs\nwith farrow, Wutzchen would hop out and run,\" Aaron said.\n\n\"_Dummel dich_, Stoltz,\" Martha said. \"I've got to make your supper yet,\nand we don't have so much as a stove lit in our tent.\"\n\nStoltzfoos slapped the team back into motion. \"What we need for our\njourney home are a few of the _altie lieder_,\" he said, reaching back in\nthe wagon for his scarred guitar. He strummed and hummed, then began\nsinging in his clear baritone: \"_In da guut alt Suumer-zeit_ ...\n\n\"... _In da guut alt Suumer-zeit_,\" Martha's voice joined him. As they\njolted along the path through the pine trees, heading toward\nDatura-village, near which their homestead stood, they sang the other\nhomey songs to the music of the old guitar. \"_Drawk Mich Zrick zu Alt\nVirginye_,\" nostalgic for the black-garbed Plain-Folk left at home. Then\nAaron's fingers danced a livelier tune on the strings: \"_Ich fang 'n\nneie Fashun aw_,\" he crowed, and Martha joined in:\n\n\"A new fashion I'll begin,\" they sang,\n\n\"The hay I'll cut in the winter;\n\n\"When the sun-heat beats, I'll loaf in the shade.\n\n\"And feast on cherry-pie.\n\n\"I'll get us a white, smearkase cow,\n\n\"And a yard full of guinea-hen geese;\n\n\"A red-beet tree as high as the moon,\n\n\"And a patent-leather fence.\n\n\"The chickens I'll keep in the kitchen,\" they sang; whereupon Martha\nbroke down laughing.\n\n\"It's a new world, and for now a cold world; but it's God's world, with\nhome just up ahead,\" Aaron shouted. He pulled the wagon up next to the\narctic tent that was to be their temporary farmhouse, beside the wagon\nloads of provision he'd brought before. He jumped down and swung Martha\nto earth. \"Light the stove, woman; make your little kitchen bright,\nwhile I make our beasts feel welcome.\"\n\nThe Amishwoman pushed aside the entrance flap of the tent. Enclosed was\na circle some twelve feet wide. The floor was bare earth. Once warmed by\nthe pump-up \"naptha\" lantern and the gasoline hotplate, it would become\na bog. Martha went out to the wagon to get a hatchet and set out for the\nnearby spinny of pines to trim off some twigs. Old Order manner forbid\ndecorative floor-coverings as improper worldly show; but a springy\ncarpet of pine-twigs could be considered as no more than a wooden floor,\nkeeping two Plain Folk from sinking to their knees in mud.\n\nThe pots were soon boiling atop the two-burner stove, steaming the\ntent's air with onion-tangy _tzvivvele Supp_ and the savory pork-smell\nof _Schnitz un Knepp_, a cannibal odor that disturbed not a bit\nWutzchen, snoring behind the cookstove. Chickens, penned beneath the\nbed, chuckled in their bedtime caucus. The cow stood cheek-by-jowl with\nYonnie, warming him with platonic graciousness as they shared the hay\nAaron had spread before them. Martha stirred her soup. \"When the bishop\nmarried me to you,\" she told Aaron, \"he said naught of my having to\nsleep with a pig.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I thought you knew that to be the purpose of Christian\nmarriage, woman,\" Aaron said, standing close.\n\n\"It's Wutz I mean,\" she said. \"Truly, I mind not a bit living as in one\nof those automobile-wagons, since it's with you, and only for a little\nwhile.\"\n\n\"I'll hire a crew of our neighbors to help with the barn tomorrow,\"\nAaron said. \"That done, you'll have but one pig to sleep with.\"\n\nAfter grace, they sat on cases of tobacco to eat their meal from a table\nof feed sacks covered with oilcloth. \"The man in the ship's little\nkitchen let me make and freeze pies, Stoltz,\" Martha said. \"He said we'd\nhave a deepfreeze big as all outdoors, without electric, so use it. Eat\ntill it's all, _Maan_; there's more back.\"\n\nYonnie bumped against Aaron's eating-elbow. \"No man and his wife have\neaten in such a zoo since Noah and his wife left the ark,\" Aaron said.\nHe cut a slice of Schnitz-pie and palmed it against the bull's big snout\nto be snuffled up. \"He likes your cooking,\" he said.\n\n\"So wash his face,\" Martha told him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOutside the tent there was a clatter of horse-iron on frozen ground.\n\"What the die-hinker is that?\" Aaron demanded. He stood and picked up\nthe naphtha lantern.\n\nOutside, Aaron saw a tall black stranger, astride a horse as pale as the\nlittle Murnan moons that lighted him. \"_Rankeshi dade!_\" the visitor\nbellowed.\n\n\"May your life be a long one!\" Aaron Stoltzfoos repeated in Hausa.\nObserving that his caller was brandishing a clenched fist, the Amishman\nobserved the same ambiguous courtesy. \"If you will enter, O Welcome\nStranger, my house will be honored.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Mother bless thee, Bearded One,\" the Murnan said. He dismounted,\ntossing his reins to one of the four retainers who remained on\nhorseback. He entered the tent after Aaron; and stared about him at the\nanimals, letting his dark eyes flick across Martha's unveiled face. At\nthe Amishman's invitation, the visitor sat himself on a tobacco case,\nrevealing as he crossed his legs elaborately embroidered trousers and\nboot tops worked with designs that would dazzle a Texan. Martha bustled\nabout hiding the remains of their meal.\n\nThe Murnan's outer dress was a woolen _riga_, the neckless gown of his\nWest-African forefathers, with a blanket draped about his shoulders,\nexactly as those ancestors had worn one in the season of the cold wind\ncalled harmattan. Aaron introduced himself as Haruna, the Hausa version\nof his name; and the guest made himself known as Sarki--Chief--of the\nvillage of Datura. His given name was Kazunzumi. Wutzchen snuffled in\nhis sleep. The Sarki glanced at the huge pig and smiled. Aaron relaxed a\nbit. The Islamic interdict on swine had been shed by the Murnans when\nthey'd become apostates, just as Colonial Survey had guessed.\n\nStoltzfoos' Hausa, learned at the Homestead School at Georgetown\nUniversity, proved adequate to its first challenge in the field, though\nhe discovered, with every experimenter in a new language, that his most\nuseful phrase was _magana sanoo-sanoo_: \"please speak slowly.\" Aaron let\nthe Chief commence the desultory conversation that would precede talk of\nconsequence. Martha, ignored by the men, sat on the edge of the bed,\nreading the big German-language Bible. Aaron and Kazunzumi sang on in\nthe heathen tongue about weather, beasts, and field-crops.\n\nThe Sarki leaned forward to examine Aaron's beard and shaven upper lip,\nonce; and smiled. The Murnan does not wear such. He looked at Martha\nmore casually now, seeing that the husband was not disgraced by his\nwife's naked face; and remarked on the whiteness of her skin in the same\ntones he'd mentioned Wutzchen's remarkable girth.\n\nAaron asked when the snows would cease, when the earth would thaw. The\nSarki told him, and said that the land here was as rich as manure.\nGradually the talk worked round to problems involving carpenters, nails,\nlumber, hinges--and money. Aaron was pleased to discover that the\nnatives thought nothing of digging a cellar and raising a barn in\nmidwinter, and that workers could be easily hired.\n\nSuddenly Sarki Kazunzumi stood and slapped his palms together. The tent\nflap was shoved open. Bowed servants, who'd shivered outside for over an\nhour, placed their master's presents on the sack table, on the twig\nfloor, even beside Martha on the bed. There were iron knives, a roast\nkid, a basket of peanuts, a sack of roasted coffee beans, a string of\ndried fruit, and a tiny earthware flask of perfume. There was even a\nwoolen riga for Aaron, black, suggesting that the Survey had said a bit\nto the natives about Amish custom; and there were bolts of\nbright-patterned cloth too worldly for aught but quilts and\ninfant-dresses, brightening Martha's eyes.\n\nAaron stood to accept the guest gifts with elaborate thanks. Sarki\nKazunzumi as elaborately bemeaned his offerings. \"Musa the carpenter\nwill appear on tomorrow's tomorrow,\" he said. \"You will, the Mother\nwilling, visit me in Datura tomorrow. We will together purchase lumber\nworthy of my friend-neighbor's barn-making. May the Mother give you\nstrength to farm, Haruna! May the Mother grant you the light of\nunderstanding!\"\n\n\"_Sannu, sannu!_\" Stoltzfoos responded. He stood at the door of his\ntent, holding his lantern high to watch the Sarki and his servants ride\noff into the darkness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"_Er iss en groesie Fisch, nee?_\" Martha asked.\n\n\"The biggest fish in these parts,\" Aaron agreed. \"Did you understand our\ntalk?\"\n\n\"The heathen speech is hard for me to learn, Stoltz,\" Martha admitted,\nspeaking in the dialect they'd both been reared to. \"While you had only\nthe alien speech to study, I spent my time learning to grow the buglets\nand tell the various sorts apart. Besides, _unser guutie Deitschie\nSchproech, asz unser Erlayser schwetzt, iss guut genunk fa mier_.\" (Our\nhonest German tongue, that our Saviour spoke, is good enough for me).\n\nAaron laughed. \"So _altfashuned_ a _Maedel_ I married,\" he said. \"Woman,\nyou must learn the Hausa, too. We must be friends to these _Schwotzers_,\nas we were friends with the English-speakers back in the United\nSchtayts.\" He pushed aside the bolt of Murnan cloth to sit beside his\nwife, and leafed through the pages of their _Familien-Bibel_, pages\nlovingly worn by his father's fingers, and his grandfather's. \"Listen,\"\nhe commanded:\n\n\"_For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks\nof water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;\na land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates;\na land of oil olive, and honey; a land wherein thou shalt eat bread\nwithout scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose\nstones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass. When thou\nhast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the Lord they God for the\ngood land which He hath given thee._\" Aaron closed the big book\nreverently. \"Awmen,\" he said.\n\n\"Awmen,\" the woman echoed. \"Aaron, with you beside me, I am not\nfretful.\"\n\n\"And with the Lord above us, I fear not in a strange land,\" Aaron said.\nHe bent to scrape a handful of earth from beneath Martha's pine-twig\ncarpet. \"_Guuter Gruundt_,\" he said. \"This will grow tall corn. Tobacco,\ntoo; the folk here relish our leaf. There will be deep grasses for the\nbeasts when the snow melts. We will prosper here, wife.\"\n\nThe next morning was cold, but the snowfall had ceased for a spell. The\nStoltzfooses had risen well before the dawn; Martha to feed herself, her\nhusband, and the chickens; Aaron to ready the horse and wagon for a trip\ninto Datura. He counted out the hoard of golden cowries he'd been loaned\nas grubstake, did some arithmetic, and allowed his wife to pour him a\nsecond cup of coffee for the road. \"You may expect the Sarki's wives to\nvisit while I'm gone,\" he remarked.\n\n\"I'd be scared half to death!\" Martha Stoltzfoos said. Her hands went to\nthe back of her head, behind the lace prayer covering. \"My hair's all\nstrooby, this place is untidy as an auction yard; besides, how can I\ntalk with those dark and heathen women? Them all decked out in golden\nbangles and silken clothes, most likely, like the bad lady of Babylon?\nAaron Stoltz, I would admire a pretty to ride into town with you.\"\n\n\"Haggling for hired-help is man's _Bissiniss_.\" he said. \"When\nKazunzumi's women come, feed them pie and peaches from the can. You'll\nfind a way to talk, or women are not sisters. I'll be back home in time\nfor evening chores.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBumping along the trail into Datura, Aaron Stoltzfoos studied the land.\nA world that could allow so much well-drained black soil to go unfarmed\nwas fortunate indeed, he mused. He thought of his father's farm, which\nwould be his elder brother's, squeezed between railroad tracks and a\nthree-lane highway, pressed from the west by an Armstrong Cork plant,\nthe very cornstalks humming in harmony with the electric lines strung\nacross the fields. This land was what the old folks had sought in\nAmerica so long ago: a wilderness ripe for the plow.\n\nThe wagon rumbled along the hoof-pocked frozen clay. Aaron analyzed the\ncontours of the hills for watershed and signs of erosion. He studied the\npatterns of the barren winter fields, fall-plowed and showing here and\nthere the stubble of a crop he didn't recognize. When the clouds scudded\nfor a moment off the sun, he grinned up, and looked back blinded to the\nroad. Good tilth and friendship were promised here, gifts to balance\nloneliness. Five years from spring, other Amish folk would come to\nhomestead--what a barn-raising they'd have! For now, though, he and\nMartha, come from a society so close-knit that each had always known the\nyield-per-acre of their remotest cousin-german, were in a land as\nstrange as the New York City Aaron, stopping in for a phone-call to the\nvet had once glimpsed on the screen of a gay-German neighbor's\nstereo-set.\n\nDatura looked to Aaron like a city from the Bible, giving it a certain\nvicarious familiarity. The great wall was a block of sunbaked mud, fifty\nfeet tall at the battlements, forty feet thick at its base; with bright,\nmeaningless flags spotted on either side of the entrance tower. The\ncowhide-shielded gate was open. Birds popped out of mud nests glued to\nthe mud wall and chattered at Aaron. Small boys wearing too little to be\nwarm appeared at the opening like flies at a hog-slaughtering to add to\nthe din, buzzing and hopping about and waving their arms as they called\ncompanions to view the black-bearded stranger.\n\nAaron whoaed his horse and took a handful of _anenes_, copper\ntenth-penny bits, to rattle between his hands. \"_Zonang!_\" he shouted:\n\"Come here! Is there a boy amongst you brave enough to ride with an\noff-worlder to the Sarki's house, pointing him the way?\"\n\nOne of the boys laughed at Aaron's slow, careful Hausa. \"Let Black-Hat's\nwhiskers point him the way!\" the boy yelled.\n\n\"_Uwaka! Ubaka!_\" Damning both parents of the rude one, another\nyoungster trotted up to Aaron's wagon and raised a skinny brown fist in\ngreeting. \"Sir Off-Worlder, I who am named Waziri, Musa-the-Carpenter's\nson, would be honored to direct you to the house of Sarki Kazunzumi.\"\n\n\"The honor, young man, is mine,\" Stoltzfoos assured the lad, raising his\nown fist gravely. \"My name is Haruna, son of Levi,\" he said, reaching\ndown to hoist the boy up beside him on the wagon's seat. \"Your friends\nhave ill manners.\" He giddapped the horse.\n\n\"Buzzard-heads!\" Waziri shouted back at his whilom companions.\n\n\"Peace, Waziri!\" Aaron protested. \"You'll frighten my poor horse into\nconniptions. Do you work for your father, the carpenter?\"\n\n\"_To_, honorable Haruna,\" the boy said. \"Yes.\" The empty wagon thumped\nover the wheel-cut streets like a wooden drum. \"By the Mother, sir, I\nhave great knowledge of planing and joining; of all the various sorts of\nwood, and the curing of them; all the tools my father uses are as\nfamiliar to me as my own left hand.\"\n\n\"Carpentry is a skillful trade,\" Aaron said. \"Myself, I am but a\nfarmer.\"\n\n\"By Mother's light! So am I!\" Waziri said, dazzled by this coincidence.\n\"I can cultivate a field free of all its noxious weeds and touch never a\nfood-plant. I can steer a plow straight as a snapped chalk-string, grade\nseed with a sure eye; I can spread manure--\"\n\n\"I'm sure you can, Waziri,\" Aaron said. \"I need a man of just those rare\nqualifications to work for me. Know you such a paragon?\"\n\n\"Mother's name! Myself, your Honor!\"\n\nAaron Stoltzfoos shook the hand of his hired man, an alien convention\nthat much impressed Waziri. The boy was to draw three hundred anenes a\nday, some thirty-five cents, well above the local minimum-wage\nconventions; and he would get his bed and meals. Aaron's confidence that\nthe boastful lad would make a farmer was bolstered by Waziri's loud\ncalculations: \"Three hundred coppers a day make, in ten day's work, a\nbronze cowrie; ten big bronzes make a silver cowrie, the price of an\nacre of land. Haruna, will you teach me your off-world farming? Will you\nallow me to buy land that neighbors yours?\"\n\n\"_Sei schtill, Buu_,\" Aaron said, laughing. \"Before you reap your first\ncrop, you must find me the Sarki.\"\n\n\"We are here, Master Haruna.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Sarki's house was no larger than its neighbors, Moorish-styled and\ndomed-roofed like the others; but it wore on its streetside walls\ndesigns cut into the stucco, scrolls and arabesques. Just above the\ndoorway, which opened spang onto the broadway of Datura, a grinning\nface peered down upon the visitors, its eyes ruby-colored glass.\n\nWaziri pounded the door for Aaron, and stepped aside to let his new\nemployer do the speaking. They were admitted to the house by a thin, old\nman wearing a pink turban. As they followed this butler down a hallway,\nAaron and Waziri heard the shrieks and giggles of feminine consternation\nthat told of women being herded into the zenana. The Amishman glimpsed\none of the ladies, perhaps Sarki Kazunzumi's most junior wife, dashing\ntoward the female sanctuary. Her eyes were lozenges of antimony; her\nhands, dipped in henna, seemed clad in pale kid gloves. Aaron, recalling\npointers on Murnan etiquette he'd received at Georgetown, elaborately\ndid not see the lady. He removed his hat as the turbaned butler bowed\nhim to a plush-covered sofa. Waziri was cuffed to a mat beside the door.\n\n\"_Rankeshi dade!_\" the Sarki said. \"May the Mother bring you the light\nof understanding.\"\n\n\"Light and long life, O Sarki,\" Stoltzfoos said, standing up.\n\n\"Will the guest who honors my roof-cup taste coffee with his fortunate\nhost?\" the Sarki asked.\n\n\"The lucky guest will be ever the Sarki's servant if your Honor allows\nhim to share his pleasure with his fellow-farmer and employee, Waziri\nthe son of Musa,\" Aaron said.\n\n\"You'd better have hired mice to guard your stored grain, O Haruna; and\nblowflies to curry your cattle, than to have engaged the son of Musa as\na farmer,\" Kazunzumi growled. \"Waziri has little light of understanding.\nHe will try to win from the soil what only honest sweat and Mother's\ngrace can cause to grow. This boy will gray your beard, Haruna.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the sun that warms the soil will light his brains to\nunderstanding,\" Aaron suggested.\n\n\"Better that your hand should leave the plowhandle from time to time to\nwarm his lazy fundament,\" the Sarki said.\n\n\"Just so, O Sarki,\" the Amishman said. \"If Waziri does not serve me\nwell, I have an enormous boar who will, if kept long enough from\nwholesomer food, rid me of a lazy farm-hand.\" Waziri grinned at all the\nattention he was getting from the two most important men in town, and\nsat expectantly as the turbaned elder brought in coffee.\n\nStoltzfoos watched the Sarki, and aped his actions. Water was served\nwith the coffee; this was to rinse the mouth that the beverage could be\ntasted with fresh taste buds. The coffee was brown as floodwater silt,\nheavy with sugar, and very hot; and the cups had no handles. \"You are\nthe first European I have seen for many years, friend Haruna,\" the Sarki\nsaid. \"It is five years gone that the white off-worlders came, and with\na black man as their voice purchased with silver the land you now\nfarm.\"\n\n\"They bought well,\" Aaron said; \"the seller sold justly. When the fist\nof winter loosens, the soil will prove as rich as butter.\"\n\n\"When the first green breaks through, and you may break the soil without\noffense, you will do well,\" Kazunzumi said. \"You are a man who loves the\nland.\"\n\n\"My fathers have flourished with the soil for twenty generations,\" the\nAmishman said. \"I pray another twenty may live to inherit my good\nfortune.\"\n\n\"Haruna,\" the Sarki said, \"I see that you are a man of the book, that\nvolume of which Mother in her grace turns over a fresh page each spring.\nThough your skin is as pale as the flesh of my palm, though you have but\none wife, though you speak throat-deep and strangely, yet you and I are\nmore alike than different. The Mother has given you light, Haruna, her\ngreatest gift.\"\n\n\"I thank the Sarki for his words,\" Aaron said. \"Sir, my good and only\nwife--I am a poor man, and bound by another law than that of the\nfortunate Kazunzumi--adds her thanks to mine for the rich gifts the\nChief of Datura presented us, his servants. In simple thanks, I have\nsome poor things to tender our benefactor.\"\n\nWaziri, perceiving the tenor of Aaron's talk, sprang to his feet and\nhastened out to the wagon for the bundles he'd seen under the seat. He\nreturned, staggering under a seventy-pound bale of long-leaf tobacco,\nproduct of Aaron's father's farm. He went back for a bolt of scarlet\nsilk for the Sarki's paramount wife, and strings of candy for the great\nman's children. He puffed in with one last brown-wrapped parcel, which\nhe unpacked to display a leather saddle. This confection was embossed\nwith a hundred intricate designs, rich with silver; un-Amish as a\nChristmas tree. Judging from the Sarki's dazzled thanks, the saddle was\njust the thing for a Murnan Chief.\n\nAs soon as Kazunzumi had delivered his pyrotechnic speech of thanks, and\nhad directed that Aaron's gifts be placed on a velvet-draped dais at the\nend of the room, a roast kid was brought in. Waziri, half drunk with the\nelegance of it all, fell to like any other adolescent boy, and was soon\ngrease to the armpits. Aaron, more careful, referred his actions to the\nSarki's. The bread must be broken, not cut; and it was eaten with the\nright hand only, the left lying in the lap as though broken. Belching\nseemed to be _de rigueur_ as a tribute to the cuisine, so Aaron belched\nhis stomach flat.\n\nBusiness could now be discussed. Aaron, having no pencil, traced with a\ngreasy finger on the tile floor the outlines of the barn and farmhouse\nhe envisaged. The Sarki from time to time demanded of young Waziri such\nfacts as a carpenter's son might be expected to know, and added\nlumber-prices in his head as Aaron's bank-barn and two-story farmhouse\ntook form in his imagination. Finally he told the Amishman what the two\nbuildings would cost. Better pleased by this figure than he'd expected\nto be, Aaron initiated the long-drawn ceremony required to discharge\nhimself from Kazunzumi's hospitality.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAs the Stoltzfoos wagon jolted out the gate of Datura, bearing the cot\nand clothes trunk of Waziri together with the owner of those chattels,\nthe boys who'd jeered before now stared with respect. The black-hatted\n_Turawa_ had been to visit the Sarki; this established him as no safe\nman to mock. Waziri gave his late playmates no notice beyond sitting\nrather straighter on the wagon seat than was comfortable.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was light enough left when they got back to the farm for Aaron and\nWaziri to pace out the dimensions of the barn and house. The bank-barn\nwould go up first, of course. No Christian owner of beasts could consent\nto being well-housed while his animals steamed and shivered in a\ncloth-sided tent. Waziri pounded stakes into the frozen ground to mark\nthe corners of the barn. Aaron pointed out the drainage-line that would\nhave to be ditched, and explained how the removed earth would be packed,\nwith the clay dug for the cellar, into a ramp leading to the barn's\nsecond story in the back. Come next fall, the hayladder could be pulled\nright up that driveway to be unloaded above the stalls. Aaron took the\nboy to the frozen-solid creek to show him where a wheel could be placed\nto lift water to a spillway for the upper fields. He introduced his new\nhelper to Wutzchen, and was pleased to hear Waziri speak wistfully of\npork chops. Waziri didn't want to meet Martha yet, though. As a proper\nMurnan boy, he was not eager to be introduced to the boss' barefaced\nwife, though she bribed him with a fat wedge of applecake.\n\nWhen Waziri set out with the lantern to tend to the final outdoor\nchores, Aaron inquired of his wife's day. The Sarki's Paramount Wife,\nwith two servants, had indeed visited, bringing more gifts of food and\nclothing. Somehow the four of them had managed to breach the\nHausa-_Pennsylfawnisch Deitsch_ curtain. \"What in the world did\nyou talk about?\" Aaron asked.\n\n\"First, not knowing what to say, I showed the ladies a drop of vinegar\nunder the microscope,\" Martha said. \"They screamed when they saw all the\nwriggly worms, and I was put to it to keep them from bundling back home.\nThen we talked about you, Stoltz, and about the farm; and when would I\nbe giving you _Kinner_ to help with all the work,\" she said. Martha\nfiddled with the cloak she was sewing for her husband. \"It was largely\ntheir heathen speech we used, so I understood only what they pointed at;\nbut they ate hearty of anything without vinegar in it, and I laughed\nwith them like with friends at a quilting-bee. My, Stoltz! Those\n_Nay-yer_ women are lovely, all jeweled like queens, even the servant\ngirls; even though they have no proper understanding of Christian\nbehavior.\"\n\n\"Did they make you feel welcome, then?\" Aaron asked.\n\n\"_Ach, ja!_ They pitied me, I thought,\" Martha said. \"They said you must\nbe poor, to have but one wife to comfort you; but they said that if the\ncrops be good, you can earn a second woman by next winter. _Chuudes\nPaste!_\"\n\n\"I hope you told the Sarki's woman we've been married only since\nhaying-time,\" Aaron said, \"and it's a bit previous for you to be giving\nme little farmhands.\"\n\n\"I did that,\" Martha said. \"I told them, too, that by the time the oak\nleaves are the size of squirrel's ears--if this place has oaks, indeed,\nor squirrels--we'd have a youngling squalling in our house, loud as any\nof the Sarki's.\"\n\nWaziri, crouched near the tent to pick up such talk as might pass inside\nconcerning himself, was at first dismayed by Aaron's whoops of joy. Then\nMartha joined her husband in happy laughter. Since her tiny-garments\nline had been delivered in Low Dutch, the young Murnan chose to believe\nthat the enthusiastic sounds he heard within the tent reflected joy at\nhis employment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was cold the week the barn was raised, and the mattocks had heavy\nwork gouging out frozen earth to be heaped into the bank leading up the\nback. The Murnan laborers seemed to think midwinter as appropriate as\nany other time for building; they said the Mother slept, and would not\nbe disturbed. Martha served coffee and buttermilk-pop at break-time, and\npresided over noontime feasts, served in several sittings, in the tent.\nBefore the workers left in the evening, Aaron would give each a drink\nout back, scharifer cider, feeling that they'd steamed hard enough to\nearn a sip of something volatile. There are matters, he mused, in which\ncommon sense can blink at a bishop; as in secretly trimming one's beard\na bit, for example, to keep it out of one's soup; or plucking a guitar\nto raise the spirits.\n\nWhen the fortnight's cold work was done, the Stoltzfoos Farm was like\nnothing seen before on Murna. The bank-barn was forty feet high. On its\nlee side, Aaron had nailed thin, horizontal strips of wood about a foot\napart, hoping to encourage the mud-daubing birds he'd seen on the wall\nat Datura to plaster their nests onto his barn, and shop for insects in\nhis fields. Lacking concrete, he'd constructed a roofless stone hut\nabutting the barn to serve as his manure shed. The farmhouse itself was\na bit gay, having an inside toilet to cheat the Murnan winters and a\nsunporch for Martha's bacteriological equipment. As the nearest Amish\n_Volle Diener_--Congregational Bishop--was eighty light-years off, and\nas the circumstances were unusual, Aaron felt that he and Martha were\nsafe from the shunning--_Meidung_--that was the Old Order's manner of\npunishing Amischers guilty of \"going gay\" by breaking the church rules\nagainst worldly show.\n\nA third outbuilding puzzled the Murnan carpenters even more than the\ntwo-storied wooden house and the enormous barn. This shed had hinged\nsidings that could be propped out to let breezes sweep through the\nbuilding. Aaron explained to Musa the function of this tobacco shed,\nwhere he would hang his lathes of long-leafed tobacco to cure from\nAugust through November. The tobacco seedlings were already sprouting in\nMason jars on the sunporch window-sills. The bank-barn's basement was\nalso dedicated to tobacco. Here, in midwinter, Aaron and Martha and\nWaziri would strip, size, and grade the dry leaves for sale in Datura.\nTobacco had always been a prime cash-crop for Levi, Aaron's father.\nAfter testing the bitter native leaf, Aaron knew that his Pennsylvania\nType 41 would sell better here than anything else he could grow.\n\nMartha Stoltzfoos was as busy in her new farmhouse as Aaron and Waziri\nwere in the barn. Her kitchen stove burned all day. Nothing ever seen in\nLancaster County, this stove was built of fireclay and brick; but the\nfood it heated was honest Deitsch. There were pickled eggs and red\nbeets, ginger tomatoes canned back home, spiced peaches, pickled pears,\nmustard pickles and chowchow, pickled red cabbage, Schnitz un Knepp,\nshoo-fly pie, vanilla pie, rhubarb sauce, Cheddar cheeses the size of\nWaziri's head, haystacks of sauerkraut, slices off the great slab of\nhome-preserved chipped beef, milk by the gallon, stewed chicken, popcorn\nsoup, rashers of bacon, rivers of coffee. In the evenings, protecting\nher fingers from the sin of idleness, Martha quilted and cross-stitched\nby lamplight. Already her parlor wall boasted a framed motto that\nreduced to half a dozen German words, the Amish philosophy of life:\n\"What One Likes Doing is No Work.\"\n\nFor all the chill of the late-winter winds, Aaron kept himself and his\nyoung helper in a sweat. Martha's cooking and the heavy work were\nslabbing muscle onto Waziri's lean, brown frame. Aaron's farming\nmethods, so much different to Murnan routines, puzzled and intrigued the\nboy. Aaron was equally bemused by the local taboos. Why, for example,\ndid all the politer Murnans eat with the right hand only? Why did the\nwomen veil themselves in his presence? And what was this Mother-goddess\nworship that seemed to require no more of its adherents than the\ninclusion of their deity's name in every curse, formal and profane?\n\"Think what you please, but not too loud,\" Aaron cautioned himself, and\ncarefully commenced to copy those Murnan speech-forms, gestures, and\nattitudes that did not conflict with his own deep convictions.\n\nBut the soil was his employment, not socializing. Aaron wormed his\nswine, inspected his horse-powered plow and harrow, gazed at the sun,\npalpated the soil, and prayed for an early spring to a God who\nunderstood German. Each day, to keep mold from strangling the moist\nmorsels, he shook the jars of tobacco seed, whose hair-fine sprouts were\njust splitting the hulls.\n\nThe rations packaged in Pennsylvania were shrinking. The Stoltzfoos\nstake of silver and gold cowries was wasting away. Each night, bruised\nwith fatigue, Aaron brought his little household into the parlor while\nhe read from the Book that had bound his folk to the soil. Waziri bowed,\nhonoring his master's God in his master's manner, but understood nothing\nof the hard High German: \"_For the Lord God will help me: therefore\nshall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint,\nand I know I shall not be ashamed. Awmen._\"\n\n\"Awmen,\" said Martha.\n\n\"Awmen,\" said Waziri, fisting his hand in respect to his friend's\nbearded God.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Murnan neighbors, to whom late winter was the slackest season in the\nfarm-year, visited often to observe and comment on the off-worlder's\nwork. Aaron Stoltzfoos privately regarded the endless conversations as\ntoo much of a good thing; but he realized that his answering the\nMurnan's questions helped work off the obligation he owed the government\nfor the eighty light-years' transportation it had given him, the\nopportunity he'd been given to earn this hundred acres with five years'\nwork, and the interest-free loans that had put up his barn and\nfarmhouse.\n\nWith Waziri hovering near, Aaron's proud lieutenant, the neighbors would\nstuff their pipes with native tobacco, a leaf that would have gagged one\nof Sir Walter Raleigh's Indian friends, while the Amishman lit a stogie\nin self-defense. Why, the neighbor farmers demanded, did Aaron propose\nto dust his bean-seeds with a powder that looked like soot? Martha's\nmicroscope, a wonder, introduced the Murnans to bacteria; and Aaron\ntediously translated his knowledge of the nitrogen-fixing symbiotes into\nHausa. But there were other questions. What was the purpose of the brush\nstacked on top of the smooth-raked beds where Aaron proposed to plant\nhis tobacco-seedlings? He explained that fire, second best to steaming,\nwould kill the weed-seeds in the soil, and give the tobacco uncrowded\nbeds to prosper in.\n\nThose needles with which he punctured the flanks of his swine and\ncattle: what devils did they exorcise? Back to the microscope for an\nexplanation of the disease-process, a sophistication the Murnans had\nlost in the years since they'd left Kano. What were the bits of blue and\npink paper Aaron pressed into mudballs picked up in the various\nprecincts of his property? Why did those slips oftentime change color,\nfrom blue to pink, or pink-to-blue? What was in those sacks of stuff--no\ndung of animals, but a sort of flour--that he intended to work into his\nsoil? Aaron answered each question as best he could, Waziri\nsupplying--and often inventing--Hausa words for concepts like\nphosphorous, ascarid worms, and litmus.\n\nAaron had as much to learn from his brown-skinned neighbors as he had to\nteach them. He was persuaded to lay in a supply of seed-yams,\nguaranteeing a crop that would bring bronze cowries next fall in Datura,\nthe price of next year's oil and cloth and tools. The peanut, a legume\nAaron had no experience of beyond purchasing an occasional tooth-ful at\nthe grocery-store, won half a dozen acres from Korean lespedeza, the\ncrop he'd at first selected as his soil-improver there. He got\nacquainted with a plant no Amishman before him had ever sown, a\ncrabgrass called fonio, a staple cereal and source of beer-malt on\nMurna, imported with the first Nigerian colonists.\n\nAaron refused to plant any lalle, the henna-shrub from which the Murnans\nmade the dye to stain their women's hands, feeling that it would be\nimproper for him to contribute to such a vanity. Bulrush millet, another\nnative crop, was ill suited to Aaron's well-drained fields. He planned\nto grow corn, though, the stuff his people called _Welschkarn_--alien\ncorn. Though American enough, maize had been a foreigner to the first\nAmish farmers, and still carried history in its name. This crop was\nchiefly for Wutzchen, whose bloodlines, Aaron was confident, would lead\nto a crop of pork of a quality these heretics from Islam had never\ntasted before.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWork wasn't everything. One Sunday, after he and Martha had sung\ntogether from the _Ausbund_, and Aaron had read from the _Schrift_ and\nthe _Martyr's Mirror_, there was time to play.\n\nSarki Kazunzumi and several other gentlemen who enjoyed City Hall or\nChamber of Commerce standing in Datura had come to visit the\nStoltzfooses after lunch; as had Musa the carpenter and his older son,\nDauda, Waziri's brother. Also on the premises were about a dozen of the\nlocal farmers and craftsmen, inspecting the curious architecture the\noff-worlder had introduced to their planet. Aaron, observing that the\ntwo classes of his guests were maintaining a polite fiction, each that\nthe other was not present, had an idea. He'd seen Murnans in town at the\nmidwinter festival, their status-consciousness forgotten in mutual\nquaffs of fonio-beer or barley-brandy, betting together at horse-races\nand wheels-of-fortune. \"My friends,\" the Amishman addressed the Murnans\ngathered in his barn, inspecting Wutzchen, \"let's play a game of ball.\"\n\nKazunzumi looked interested. As the local Chief of State, the Sarki's\napproval guaranteed the enthusiasm of all the lesser ranks.\n\nAaron explained the game he had in mind. It wasn't baseball, an\n\"English\" sport foreign to Amishmen, who can get through their teens\nwithout having heard of either Comiskey Park or the World Series. Their\ngame, _Mosch Balle_, fits a barnyard better.\n\nIn lieu of the regulation softball used in the game of Corner Ball,\nMartha had stitched together a sort of large beanbag. The playing-field\nAaron set up with the help of his visitors was a square some twelve\nyards on a side, fence-rails being propped up to mark its boundaries and\nfresh straw forked onto it six inches deep as footing.\n\nAaron's eight-man team was chosen from the working-stiffs. The opposing\neight were the Brass. To start the game, four of the proletarians stood\nat the corners of the square; and two men of Kazunzumi's team waited\nwarily within.\n\nAaron commenced to explain the game. To say that the object of _Mosch\nBalle_ is for a member of the outer, offensive, team to strike an inner,\ndefensive man with the ball is inadequate; such an explanation is as\nlacking as to explain baseball as the pitcher's effort to throw a ball\nso well that it's hittable, and so very well that it yet goes unhit.\nBoth games have their finer points.\n\n\"Now,\" Aaron told his guests on the field, \"we four on the corners will\ntoss the ball back and forth amongst ourselves, shouting _Hah_,_Oh_,_Tay_,\nwith each pitch. Whoever has the ball on _Tay_ has to fling it at one of\nthe two men inside the square. If he misses, he's Out; and one of the\nother men on our team takes his place. If he hits his target-man, the\ntarget's Out, and will be replaced by another man from the Sarki's team.\nThe team with the last man left on the straw wins the first half. _Des\niss der Weeg wie mir's diehne_, O.K.?\"\n\n\"_Afuwo!_\" the Sarki yelled, a woman's call, grinning, crouched to\nspring aside. \"Hah!\" Aaron shouted, and tossed the ball to Waziri's\nolder brother, Dauda. \"Oh!\" Dauda yelled, and threw the ball to the\nshoemaker. \"Tay!\" the cobbler exulted, and slammed the ball at the\nlower-ranking of the two men within the square, the village banker. The\nshoemaker missed, and was retired.\n\nThe Daturans were soon stripped down to trousers and boots, their black\ntorsos steaming in the cold air. Aaron removed his shirt--but not his\nhat--and so far forgot his Hausa in the excitement that he not only\nrooted for his teammates in _Pennsylfawnisch Deitsch_, but even\npunctuated several clumsy plays with raw _Fadomm_'s.\n\nAaron's skill won the first half for his team. Blooded, the Chamber of\nCommerce Eight fought through to win the second half. A tie. The\nplay-off saw the Working-Man's League pummeled to a standstill by the\nC-of-C, who took the laurels with a final slam that knocked Waziri into\nthe straw, protesting that it was an accident.\n\nSweating, laughing, social status for the moment forgotten, the teams\nand their mobs of fans surged into the farmhouse to demand of Martha\nwedges of raisin pie and big cups of strong coffee. As the guests put\ntheir rigas and their white caps back on, and assumed therewith their\ngame-discarded rank of class, they assured Aaron that the afternoon at\nthe ball game had been a large success.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next day was crisp and cold. With nothing more to be done till the\nsoil thawed, Aaron took Waziri down to the creek to investigate his\nproject of irrigating the hilltop acres. The flow of water was so feeble\nthat the little stream was ice to its channel. \"Do you have hereabouts a\ndigger-of-waterholes?\" Aaron asked the boy. Waziri nodded, and supplied\nthe Hausa phrase for this skill. \"Good. _Wonn's Gottes wille iss_, I\nwill find a spot for them to dig, smelling out the water as can my\ncousin Blue Ball Benjamin Blank,\" Aaron said. \"Go get from the barn the\npliers, the hand-tool that pinches.\"\n\nWaziri trotted off and brought back the pliers. \"What are you up to,\nHaruna-boss?\" he asked. Aaron was holding the bulldog pliers out before\nhim, one handle in each hand, parallel to the ground.\n\n\"I am smelling for the well-place,\" the Amishman said, pacing\ndeliberately across the field. The boy scampered along beside him. \"We\nwill need at least one well to be safe from August draught. Cousin\nBenjamin found the wet depths in this fashion; perhaps it will work for\nme.\" Aaron walked, arms outstretched, for half an hour before his face\ngrew taut. He slowed his walking and began to work toward the center of\na spiral. Waziri could see the sweat springing up on the young farmer's\nbrow and fingers, despite the cold breeze that blew. The bulldog pliers\ntrembled as though responding to the throbbing of an engine. Suddenly,\nas though about to be jerked from Aaron's hands, the pliers tugged\ndownward so forceably that he had to lift his elbows and flex his wrists\nto hold onto them. \"Put a little pile of stones here, Waziri,\" he said.\n\"We'll have the diggers visit as soon as the ground thaws.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWaziri shook his head. \"Haruna, they will not touch soft earth until the\nfirst grass sprouts,\" he said.\n\n\"Time enough,\" Aaron said. He looked up to satisfy himself that his\nprospective well-site was high enough to avoid drainage from his\npig-yard, then left the Murnan boy to pile up a cairn for the diggers.\nIt would be good to have a windmill within ear-shot of the house, he\nmused; its squeaking would ease Martha with a homey sound.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAlone for a few minutes, Aaron retired to the workshop in the cellar of\nthe barn. He planed and sanded boards of a native lumber very like to\ntulipwood. Into the headboard of the cradle he was making, he\nkeyhole-sawed the same sort of broad Dutch heart that had marked his own\ncradle, and the cradles of all his family back to the days in the\nRhineland, before they'd been driven to America.\n\nMartha Stoltzfoos was speaking Hausa better than she'd spoken English\nsince grade-school days, and she kept busy in the little bacteriological\nlaboratory on her sunporch, keeping fresh the skills she'd learned at\nGeorgetown and might some day need in earnest; but she still grew\nhomesick as her child-coming day drew nearer. It was wrong, she told\nAaron, for an Amishwoman to have heathen midwives at her lying-in. For\nall their kindness, the Murnan women could never be as reassuring as the\nprayer-covered, black-aproned matrons who'd have attended Martha back\nhome. \"Ach, Stoltz,\" she told her husband, \"if only a few other of\n_unser sart Leit_ could have come here with us.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Love,\" Aaron said. \"I've eased calves and colts enough\ninto the world; man-children can't come so different.\"\n\n\"You talk like a man,\" Martha accused him. \"I wish my Mem was just down\nthe road a piece, ready to come a-running when my time came,\" she said.\nShe put one hand on her apron. \"_Chuudes Paste!_ The little rascal is\nwild as a colt, indeed. Feel him, Stoltz!\"\n\nAaron dutifully placed his hand to sense the child's quickening. \"He'll\nbe of help on the farm, so strong as he is,\" he remarked. Then, tugging\nhis hat down tight, Aaron went outdoors, bashful before this mystery.\n\nThe little creek had thawed, and the light of the sun on a man's face\nalmost gave back the heat the air extorted. Waziri had gone to town\ntoday for some sort of Murnan spring-festival, eager to celebrate his\nhard-earned wealth on his first day off in months. The place seemed\ndeserted, Aaron felt, without the boy; without the visitors he'd played\nball and talked crops with, striding up in their scarlet-trimmed rigas\nto gossip with their friend Haruna.\n\nBetween the roadway and the house, Aaron knelt to rake up with his\nfingers a handful of the new-thawed soil. He squeezed it. The clod in\nhis hand broke apart of its own weight: it was not too wet to work.\nFestival-day though it was to his _Schwotzer_ neighbors, he was eager to\nspear this virgin soil with his plow blade.\n\nAaron strode back to the barn. He hitched Rosina--the dappled mare,\nnamed \"Raisin\" for her spots--to the plow and slapped her into motion.\nSleek with her winter's idleness, Rosina was at first unenthusiastic\nabout the plow; but the spring sun and honest exercise warmed her\nquickly. Within half an hour she was earning her keep. Though Aaron was\nplowing shallow, the compact soil broke hard. Rosina leaned into the\ntraces, leaving hoofprints three inches deep. No gasoline tractor, Aaron\nmused, could ever pull itself through soil so rich and damp.\n_Geilsgrefte_, horsepower, was best exerted by a horse, he thought.\n\nThe brown earth-smells were good. Aaron kicked apart the larger clods,\nfat with a planet-life of weather and rich decay. This land would take a\ngood deal of disking to get it into shape. His neighbors, who'd done\ntheir heavy plowing just after last fall's first frost, were already\nwell ahead of him. He stabled Rosina at sundown, and went in to sneak a\nwell-earned glass of hard cider past Martha's teetotaling eye.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMusa the carpenter brought his son home well after dark. Waziri had had\nadventures, the old man said; dancing, gambling on the Fool's Wheel,\nsampling fonio-beer, celebrating his own young life's springtime with\nthe earth's. Both the old man and the boy were barefoot, Aaron noticed;\nbut said nothing: perhaps shoelessness was part of their\nspring-festival.\n\nWaziri a bit _geschwepst_ with the beer, tottered off to bed. \"Thanks to\nyou, friend Haruna, that boy became a man today,\" the carpenter said. He\naccepted a glass of Aaron's cider. \"Today Waziri's wallet jingled with\nbronze and copper earned by his own sweat, a manful sound to a lad of\nfifteen summers. I ask pardon for having returned your laborer in so\ndamaged a condition, brother Haruna; but you may be consoled with the\nthought that the Mother's festival comes but once in the twelve-month.\"\n\n\"No harm was done, brother Musa,\" Aaron said, offering his visitor\ntobacco. \"In my own youth, I sometimes danced with beer-light feet to\nthe music of worldly guitars; and yet I reached a man's estate.\"\n\nOffered a refill for his pipe, Musa raised a hand in polite refusal.\n\"Tomorrow's sun will not wait on our conversation, and much must be\ndone, in the manner of racers waiting the signal, before the first blade\nbreaks the soil,\" he said. \"Good night, brother Haruna; and may Mother\ngrant you light!\"\n\n\"Mother keep you, brother Musa,\" Aaron murmured the heathen phrase\nwithout embarrassment. \"I'll guide your feet to your wagon, if I may.\"\n\nAaron, carrying the naphtha lantern, led the way across the strip of\nnew-plowed soil. Set by frost into plastic mounds and ridges, the earth\nbent beneath his shoes and the carpenter's bare feet. Aaron swung Musa's\npicket-iron, the little anchor to which his horse was tethered, into the\nwagon, noticing that it had been curiously padded with layers of quilted\ncloth. \"May you journey home in good health, brother Musa,\" he said.\n\n\"_Uwaka!_\" Musa shouted, staring at the plow-cuts.\n\nAaron Stoltzfoos dropped the lantern to his side, amazed that the\ndignified old man could be guilty of such an obscenity. Perhaps he'd\nmisheard. \"Haruna, you have damned yourself!\" Musa bellowed. \"Cursed be\nthis farm! Cursed be thy farming! May thy seedlings rot, may thy corn\nsprout worms for tassles, may your cattle stink and make early bones!\"\n\n\"Brother Musa!\" Aaron said.\n\n\"I am no sib to you, O Bearded One,\" Musa said. \"Nor will I help you\ncarry the curse you have brought upon yourself by today's ill-doing.\" He\ndarted back to the farmhouse, where he ordered half-wakened Waziri to\npad barefoot after him to the wagon, rubbing his eyes. \"Come, son,\" Musa\nsaid. \"We must flee these ill-omened fields.\" Without another word to\nhis host, the carpenter hoisted his boy into the wagon, mounted, and set\noff into the night. The hoofs of his horse padded softly against the\ndirt road, unshod.\n\nMartha met the bewildered Aaron at the door, wakened by Musa's shouting.\n\"_Wass gibt_, Stoltz?\" she asked. \"What for was all the carry-on?\"\n\nAaron tugged at his beard. \"I don't know, woman,\" he admitted. \"Musa the\ncarpenter took one look at the plowing I did today, then cursed me as\nthough he'd caught me spitting in his well. He got Waziri up from bed\nand took him home.\" He took his wife's hand. \"I'm sorry he woke you up,\nLiebchen.\"\n\n\"It was not so much the angry carpenter who waked me as the little jack\nrabbit you're father to,\" Martha said. \"As you say, a _Bun_ who can kick\nso hard, and barefoot, too, will be a strong one once he's born.\"\n\nAaron was staring out the window onto the dark road. \"_Farwas hot Musa\nsell gehuh?_\" he asked himself. \"What for did Musa do such a thing? He\nknows that our ways are different to his. If I did aught wrong, Musa\nmust know it was done not for want to harm. I will go to the village\ntomorrow; Musa must forgive me and explain.\"\n\n\"He will, Stoltz.\" Martha said. \"_Kuum, schloef._ You'll be getting up\nearly.\"\n\n\"How can I sleep, not knowing how I have hurt my friend?\" Aaron asked.\n\n\"You must,\" Martha urged him. \"Let your cares rest for the night,\nAaron.\"\n\nIn the morning, Stoltzfoos prepared for his trip into Datura by donning\nhis Sunday-best. He clipped a black patent-leather bow tie, a wedding\ngift, onto his white shirt: and fastened up his best broadfall trousers\nwith his dress suspenders. Over this, Aaron put his _Mutzi_, the tailed\nfrock coat that fastened with hooks-and-eyes. When he'd exchanged his\nbroad-brimmed black felt working-hat for another just the same, but\nunsweated, Aaron was dressed as he'd be on his way to a House-Amish\nSunday meeting back home. \"I expect no trouble here, Martha,\" he said,\ntucking a box of stogies under his arm as a little guest-gift for the\nold carpenter.\n\n\"Hurry home, Stoltz; I feel wonderful busy about the middle,\" Martha\nsaid. There was a noise out on the road. \"Listen!\" she said. \"Go look\nthe window out, now; someone is coming the yard in!\"\n\nAaron hastened to lift the green roller-blind over the parlor window.\n\"Ach; it is the _groesie Fisch_, Sarki Kazunzumi, with half the folk\nfrom town,\" he said. \"Stay here, woman. I will out and talk with them.\"\n\nThe Sarki sat astride his white pony, staring as Aaron approached him.\nBehind their chief, on lesser beasts, sat Kazunzumi's retainers, each\nwith a bundle in his arms. \"Welcome, O Sarki!\" Aaron said, raising his\nfist.\n\nKazunzumi did not return the Amishman's salute. \"I return your gifts,\nLightless One,\" he announced. \"They are tainted with your blasphemy.\" He\nnodded, and his servants dismounted to stack at the side of the road\nAaron's guest-gifts of months before. The bale of tobacco was set down,\nthe bolt of scarlet silk, the chains of candy, the silver-filigreed\nsaddle. \"Now that I owe you naught, Bearded One, we have no further\nbusiness with one another.\" He reined his horse around. \"I go in\nsadness, Haruna,\" he said.\n\n\"What did I do, Kazunzumi?\" Aaron asked. \"What am I to make of your\ndispleasure?\"\n\n\"You have failed us, who was my friend,\" the Sarki said. \"You will leave\nthis place, taking your woman and your beasts and your sharp-shod\nhorses.\"\n\n\"Sir, where am I to go?\"\n\n\"Whence came you, Haruna?\" the Sarki asked. \"Return to your own\nblack-garbed folk, and injure the Mother no longer with your lack of\nunderstanding.\"\n\n\"Sarki Kazunzumi, I know not how I erred,\" Stoltzfoos said. \"As for\nreturning to my own country, that I cannot. The off-world vessel that\nbrought us here is star-far away; and it will not return until we are\nall five summers older. My Martha is besides with child, and cannot\nsafely travel. My land is ripe for seeding. How can I go now?\"\n\n\"There is wilderness to the south, where no son of the Mother lives,\"\nthe Sarki said. \"Go there. I care not for heathen who are out of my\nsight.\"\n\n\"Sir, show us mercy,\" Aaron said.\n\nKazunzumi danced his shoeless horse around to face Aaron. \"Haruna, who\nwas my friend, whom I thought to stand with me in Mother's light, I\nwould be merciful; but I cannot be weak. It is not me whom you must\nbeseech, but the Mother who feeds us all. Make amends to Her, then Sarki\nKazunzumi will give his ear to your pleas. Without amends, Haruna, you\nmust go from here within the week.\" Kazunzumi waved his arm and galloped\noff toward Datura. His servants followed quickly. On the roadside lay\nthe gifts, dusted from the dirt raised by the horses.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Amishman turned toward the house. Martha's face was at the parlor\nwindow, quizzical under her prayer-covering, impatient to hear what had\nhappened. Aaron plodded back to the house with the evil news, stumbling\nover a clod of earth in the new-turned furrows near the road. Martha met\nhim at the door. \"_Waas will er?_\" she demanded.\n\n\"He says we must leave our farm.\"\n\n\"Why for?\" she asked.\n\n\"Somehow, I have offended their _fadommt_ Mum-god,\" Aaron said. \"The\nSarki has granted us a week to make ready to go into the wilderness.\" He\nsat on a coffee-colored kitchen chair, his head bowed and his big hands\nlimp between his knees.\n\n\"Stoltz, where can we go?\" Martha asked. \"We have no _Freindschaft_, no\nkin, in all this place.\"\n\nAaron tightened his hands into fists. \"We will not go!\" he vowed. \"I\nwill find a way for us to stay.\" He broke open the box of cigars that\nhad been meant as a gift for Musa and clamped one of the black stogies\nbetween his teeth. \"What is their _heidisch_ secret?\" he demanded. \"What\ndoes the Mother want of me?\"\n\n\"Aaron Stoltz,\" Martha said vigorously, \"I'll have no man of mine\noffering dignity to a heathen god. The _Schrift_ orders us to cut down\nthe groves of the alien gods, to smash their false images; not to bow\nbefore them. Will you make a golden calf here, as did your namesake\nAaron of Egypt, for whose sin the Children of Israel were plagued?\"\n\n\"Woman, I'll not have you preach to me like a servant of the Book,\"\nAaron said. \"It is not for you to cite Scripture.\" He stared through the\nwindow. \"What does the Mother want of me?\"\n\n\"As you shout, do not forget that I am a mother, too,\" Martha said. She\ndabbed a finger at her eye.\n\n\"_Fagep mir_, Liebling,\" Aaron said. He walked behind the chair where\nhis wife sat. Tenderly, he kneaded the muscles at the back of her neck.\n\"I am trying to get inside Musa's head, and Kazunzumi's; I am trying to\nsee their world through their eyes. It is not an easy thing to do,\nMartha. Though I lived for a spell among the 'English,' my head is still\nHouse-Amish; a fat, Dutch cheese.\"\n\n\"It is a good head,\" Martha said, relaxing under his massage, \"and if\nthere be cheese-heads hereabouts, it's these blackfolk that wear them,\nand not my man.\"\n\n\"If I knew what the die-hinker our neighbors mean by their Mother-talk,\nit might be I could see myself through Murnan eyes, as I can hear a bit\nwith Hausa ears,\" Aaron said. \"_Iss sell nix so_, Martha?\"\n\n\"We should have stood at home, and thought with our own good heads,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"Let me think,\" Aaron said. \"If I were to strike you, wife,\" he mused,\n\"it could do you great hurt, and harm our unborn child, _Nee?_\"\n\n\"Aaron!\" Martha scooted out from under her husbands kneading hands.\n\n\"_Druuvel dich net!_\" he said. \"I am only thinking. These blackfolk now,\nthese neighbors who were before last night our friends, speak of Light\nas our bishop at home speaks of Grace. To have it is to have all, to be\none with the congregation. If I can find this Light, we and the Sarki\nand his people can again be friends.\" Aaron sat down. \"I must learn what\nI have done wrong,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Other than drink a glass of cider now and then, and make worldly music\nwith a guitar, you've done no wrong,\" Martha said stubbornly. \"You're a\ngood man.\"\n\n\"In the Old Order, I am a good man, so long as no _Diener_ makes trouble\nover a bit of singing or cider,\" Aaron said. \"As a guest on Murna, I\nhave done some deed that has hurt this Mother-god, whom our neighbors\nhold dear.\"\n\n\"Heathenish superstition!\"\n\n\"Martha, love, I am older than you, and a man,\" Aaron said. \"Give me\nroom to think! If the goddess-Mother is heathen as Baal, it matters not;\nthese folk who worship her hold our future in their hands. Besides, we\nowe them the courtesy not to dance in their churches nor to laugh at\ntheir prayers; even the 'English' have more grace than that.\" Aaron\npondered. \"Something in the springtime is the Murnan Mother's gift, her\ngreatest gift. What?\"\n\n\"Blaspheme not,\" Martha said. \"Remember Him who _causeth the grass to\ngrow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring\nforth food out of the earth_.\"\n\n\"Wife, is the True God less, if these people call Him Mother?\" Aaron\ndemanded.\n\n\"We are too far from home,\" the woman sighed. \"Such heavy talk is\nwearisome; it is for bishops to discourse so, not ordinary folk like\nus.\"\n\n\"If I can't find the light,\" Aaron said, \"this farm we live on, and\nhoped to leave to our children, isn't worth the water in a dish of\nsoup.\" He slapped his hands together and stood to pace. \"Martha, hear me\nout,\" he said. \"If a woman be with child, and a man takes her with lust\nand against her will, is not that man accursed?\"\n\n\"Aaron!\" she said. \"_Haagott_, such wicked talk you make!\"\n\n\"Seen with Murnan eyes, have I not done just such a cursed thing?\" Aaron\ndemanded. \"The Mother-god of this world is _mit Kinndt_, fat with the\nbounty of springtime. So tender is the swollen belly of the earth that\nthe people here, simple folk with no more subtle God, strip the iron\nfrom the hoofs of their horses not to bruise her. They bare their feet\nin her honor, treat her with the tenderness I treat my beloved Martha.\nAnd to this Goddess, swollen earth, I took the plow! Martha, we are\nfortunate indeed that our neighbors are gentle people, or I would be\nhanged now, or stoned to death like the wicked in the old days. _Ich hot\niere Gotterin awgepockt_: I raped their Goddess!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMartha burst into tears. When Aaron stepped forward to comfort her, she\nstruck his chest with her balled fists. \"Stoltz, I wed you despite your\nbeer-drinking from cans at the Singing, though you play a worldly guitar\nand sing the English songs, though people told me you drove your gay\nUncle Amos' black-bumpered Ford before you membered to the district;\nstill, house-Amish pure Old Order though my people are, I married you,\nfrom love and youngness and girlish ignorance. But I do not care, even\nin this wilderness you've brought us to in that big English ship, to\nhear such vileness spoke out boldly. Leave me alone.\"\n\n\"I'll not.\"\n\n\"You'd best,\" she said. \"I'm sore offended in the lad I'm wifed to.\"\n\n\"Love, _Ich bin sorry_,\" Aaron said. \"The Book, though, says just what\nour neighbors told me: Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set\nyou free. I have found the truth, the truth of our dark-skinned friends.\nI did not want to wound the ears of _da Oppel fuun mein Awk_,\napple-of-mine-eye sweet Martha; but I must speak out the truth.\"\n\n\"It is not good enough,\" Martha sobbed, \"that you accept this\nbrown-skinned, jewel-bedizzened woman-god; but you must make love to\nher; and I, wed to you by the Book, nine months gone with _Kinndt_, am\nto make no fuss.\"\n\n\"I loved the Mother-god with the plow, and accidentally,\" Aaron\nbellowed. \"_Haagott!_ woman; have you no funny?\"\n\n\"I will birth our child in my lap from laughing,\" Martha said, weeping.\n\"Aaron, do what you will. I can hardly walk home to my Mem to bear a son\nin my girlhood bedroom. We are like _Awduum uuu Ayf_, like you said; but\nthe serpent in this Eden pleases me not.\"\n\n\"When I spoke of colts, and the borning of them,\" Aaron said, \"I forgot\nme that mares are more sensible than human women. Martha, _liebe_\nMartha, you wed a man when you married me. All your vapors are naught\nagainst my having seen the light. If to stay here, on this land already\nwatered with my hard sweat, I had to slaughter cattle in sacrifice to\nthe Mother, I'd pick up the knife gladly, and feel it no blasphemy\nagainst our God.\"\n\n\"Aaron Stoltz,\" Martha said, \"I forbid you to lend honor to this god!\"\n\nAaron sat. He unlaced his shoes and tugged them off. \"Woman,\" he asked\nsoftly, \"you forbid me? Martha, for all the love I bear you, there is\none rule of our folk that's as holy as worship; and that's that the man\nis master in his house.\" He pulled off his black stockings and stood,\nbarefoot, with callouses won on the black earth of his father's farm;\ndressed otherwise meetly as a deacon. \"I will walk to Datura on my naked\nfeet to show our friends I know my wrong-doing, that I have hurt the\nbelly of the pregnant earth. I will tell Sarki Kazunzumi that I have\nseen his light; that my horses will be unshod as I am, that the Mother\nwill not feel my plow again until the grasses spring, when her time will\nbe accomplished.\"\n\nMartha crossed her hands about her middle. \"Ach, Stoltz,\" she said. \"Our\n_Buu iss reddi far geh_, I think. Today will be his birthday. Don't let\nyour tenderness to the earth keep you from walking swiftly to Datura;\nand when you return, come in a wagon with the Sarki's ladies, who\nunderstand midwifery. I think they will find work here.\"\n\n\"I will hurry, Mother,\" Aaron promised.\n\n\nThe End.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Blind Man's Lantern, by Allen Kim Lang\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BLIND MAN'S LANTERN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 24567.txt or 24567.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/5/6/24567/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Geetu Melwani and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
