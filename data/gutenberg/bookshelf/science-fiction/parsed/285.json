For myself on\nthese occasions I like a bit of a run as an early refresher. But here on\nthis rough ground in the middle of the island there were not three yards\nof level to be found, and so as Coppinger proceeded to go through some\nsort of dumb-bell exercises with a couple of lumps of bristly lava, I\nfollowed his example. Coppinger has done a good deal of roughing it in\nhis time, but being a doctor of medicine amongst other things--he takes\nout a new degree of some sort on an average every other year--he is\ngreat on health theories, and practises them like a religion.\n\nThere had been rain two days before, and as there was still a bit of\nstream trickling along at the bottom of the barranca, we went down there\nand had a wash, and brushed our teeth. Greatest luxury imaginable, a\ntoothbrush, on this sort of expedition.\n\n\"Now,\" said Coppinger when we had emptied our pockets, \"there's precious\nlittle grub left, and it's none the better for being carried in a local\nSpanish newspaper.\"\n\n\"Yours is mostly tobacco ashes.\"\n\n\"It'll get worse if we leave it. We've a lot more bad scrambling ahead\nof us.\"\n\nThat was obvious. So we sat down beside the stream there at the bottom\nof the barranca, and ate up all of what was left. It was a ten-mile\ntramp to the fonda at Santa Brigida, where we had set down our traps;\nand as Coppinger wanted to take a lot more photographs and measurements\nbefore we left this particular group of caves, it was likely we should\nbe pretty sharp set before we got our next meal, and our next taste of\nthe PATRON'S splendid old country wine. My faith! If only they knew down\nin the English hotels in Las Palmas what magnificent wines one could\nget--with diplomacy--up in some of the mountain villages, the old\nvintage would become a thing of the past in a week.\n\nNow to tell the truth, the two mummies he had gathered already quite\nsatisfied my small ambition. The goatskins in which they were sewn up\nwere as brittle as paper, and the poor old things themselves gave out\ndust like a puffball whenever they were touched. But you know what\nCoppinger is. He thought he'd come upon traces of an old Guanche\nuniversity, or sacred college, or something of that kind, like the one\nthere is on the other side of the island, and he wouldn't be satisfied\ntill he'd ransacked every cave in the whole face of the cliff. He'd\nplenty of stuff left for the flashlight thing, and twenty-eight more\nfilms in his kodak, and said we might as well get through with the job\nthen as make a return journey all on purpose. So he took the crowbar,\nand I shouldered the rope, and away we went up to the ridge of the\ncliff, where we had got such a baking from the sun the day before.\n\nOf course these caves were not easy to come at, or else they would have\nbeen raided years before. Coppinger, who on principle makes out he\nknows all about these things, says that in the old Guanche days they\nhad ladders of goatskin rope which they could pull up when they were at\nhome, and so keep out undesirable callers; and as no other plan occurs\nto me, perhaps he may be right. Anyway the mouths of the caves were in\na more or less level row thirty feet below the ridge of the cliff, and\nfifty feet above the bottom; and Spanish curiosity doesn't go in much\nwhere it cannot walk.\n\nNow laddering such caves from below would have been cumbersome, but a\nlight knotted rope is easily carried, and though it would have been hard\nto climb up this, our plan was to descend on each cave mouth from above,\nand then slip down to the foot of the cliffs, and start again AB INITIO\nfor the next.\n\nCoppinger is plucky enough, and he has a good head on a height, but\nthere is no getting over the fact that he is portly and nearer fifty\nthan forty-five. So you can see he must have been pretty keen. Of course\nI went first each time, and got into the cave mouth, and did what I\ncould to help him in; but when you have to walk down a vertical cliff\nface fly-fashion, with only a thin bootlace of a rope for support, it\nis not much real help the man below can give, except offer you his best\nwishes.\n\nI wanted to save him as much as I could, and as the first three caves\nI climbed to were small and empty, seeming to be merely store-places,\nI asked him to take them for granted, and save himself the rest. But\nhe insisted on clambering down to each one in person, and as he decided\nthat one of my granaries was a prison, and another a pot-making factory,\nand another a schoolroom for young priests, he naturally said he hadn't\nmuch reliance on my judgment, and would have to go through the whole\nlot himself. You know what these thorough-going archaeologists are for\nimagination.\n\nBut as the day went on, and the sun rose higher, Coppinger began clearly\nto have had enough of it, though he was very game, and insisted on going\non much longer than was safe. I must say I didn't like it. You see\nthe drop was seldom less than eighty feet from the top of the cliffs.\nHowever, at last he was forced to give it up. I suggested marching off\nto Santa Brigida forthwith, but he wouldn't do that. There were three\nmore cave-openings to be looked into, and if I wouldn't do them for him,\nhe would have to make another effort to get there himself. He tried to\nmake out he was conferring a very great favour on me by offering to take\na report solely from my untrained observation, but I flatly refused to\nlook at it in that light. I was pretty tired also; I was soaked with\nperspiration from the heat; my head ached from the violence of the sun;\nand my hands were cut raw with the rope.\n\nCoppinger might be tired, but he was still enthusiastic. He tried to\nmake me enthusiastic also. \"Look here,\" he said, \"there's no knowing\nwhat you may find up there, and if you do lay hands on anything,\nremember it's your own. I shall have no claim whatever.\"\n\n\"Very kind of you, but I've got no use for any more mummies done up in\ngoatskin bags.\"\n\n\"Bah! That's not a burial cave up there. Don't you know the difference\nyet in the openings? Now, be a good fellow. It doesn't follow that\nbecause we have drawn all the rest blank, you won't stumble across a\ngood find for yourself up there.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" I said, as he seemed so set on it; and away I stumbled\nover the fallen rocks, and along the ledge, and then scrambled up by\nthat fissure in the cliff which saved us the two-mile round which we had\nhad to take at first. I wrenched out the crowbar, and jammed it down\nin a new place, and then away I went over the side, with hands smarting\nworse at every new grip of the rope. It was an awkward job swinging into\nthe cave mouth because the rock above overhung, or else (what came to\nthe same thing) it had broken away below; but I managed it somehow,\nalthough I landed with an awkward thump on my back, and at the same time\nI didn't let go the rope. It wouldn't do to have lost the rope then:\nCoppinger couldn't have flicked it into me from where he was below.\n\nNow from the first glance I could see that this cave was of different\nstructure to the others. They were for the most part mere dens, rounded\nout anyhow; this had been faced up with cutting tools, so that all the\nangles were clean, and the sides smooth and flat. The walls inclined\ninwards to the roof, reminding me of an architecture I had seen before\nbut could not recollect where, and moreover there were several rooms\nconnected up with passages. I was pleased to find that the other\ncave-openings which Coppinger wanted me to explore were merely the\nwindows or the doorways of two of these other rooms.\n\nOf inscriptions or markings on the walls there was not a trace, though I\nlooked carefully, and except for bats the place was entirely bare. I\nlit a cigarette and smoked it through--Coppinger always thinks one is\nslurring over work if it is got through too quickly--and then I went\nto the entrance where the rope was, and leaned out, and shouted down my\nnews.\n\nHe turned up a very anxious face. \"Have you searched it thoroughly?\" he\nbawled back.\n\n\"Of course I have. What do you think I've been doing all this time?\"\n\n\"No, don't come down yet. Wait a minute. I say, old man, do wait a\nminute. I'm making fast the kodak and the flashlight apparatus on the\nend of the rope. Pull them up, and just make me half a dozen exposures,\nthere's a good fellow.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" I said, and hauled the things up, and got them inside.\nThe photographs would be absolutely dull and uninteresting, but that\nwouldn't matter to Coppinger. He rather preferred them that way. One has\nto be careful about halation in photographing these dark interiors, but\nthere was a sort of ledge like a seat by the side of each doorway, and\nso I lodged the camera on that to get a steady stand, and snapped off\nthe flashlight from behind and above.\n\nI got pictures of four of the chambers this way, and then came to one\nwhere the ledge was higher and wider. I put down the camera, wedged it\nlevel with scraps of stone, and then sat down myself to recharge the\nflashlight machine. But the moment my weight got on that ledge, there\nwas a sharp crackle, and down I went half a dozen inches.\n\nOf course I was up again pretty sharply, and snapped up the kodak just\nas it was going to slide off to the ground. I will confess, too, I was\nfeeling pleased. Here at any rate was a Guanche cupboard of sorts, and\nas they had taken the trouble to hermetically seal it with cement, the\nodds were that it had something inside worth hiding. At first there\nwas nothing to be seen but a lot of dust and rubble, so I lit a bit of\ncandle and cleared this away. Presently, however, I began to find that\nI was shelling out something that was not cement. It chipped away, in\nregular layers, and when I took it to the daylight I found that each\nlayer was made up of two parts. One side was shiny stuff that looked\nlike talc, and on this was smeared a coating of dark toffee-coloured\nmaterial, that might have been wax. The toffee-coloured surface was\nworked over with some kind of pattern.\n\nNow I do not profess to any knowledge on these matters, and as a\nconsequence took what Coppinger had told me about Guanche habits and\nacquirements as more or less true. For instance, he had repeatedly\nimpressed upon me that this old people could not write, and having this\nin my memory, I did not guess that the patterns scribed through the\nwax were letters in some obsolete character, which, if left to myself,\nprobably I should have done. But still at the same time I came to\nthe conclusion that the stuff was worth looting, and so set to work\nquarrying it out with the heel of my boot and a pocket-knife.\n\nThe sheets were all more or less stuck together, and so I did not go in\nfor separating them farther. They fitted exactly to the cavity in which\nthey were stored, but by smashing down its front I was able to get at\nthe foot of them, and then I hacked away through the bottom layers with\nthe knife till I got the bulk out in one solid piece. It measured some\ntwenty inches by fifteen, by fifteen, but it was not so heavy as it\nlooked, and when I had taken the remaining photographs, I lowered it\ndown to Coppinger on the end of the rope.\n\nThere was nothing more to do in the caves then, so I went down myself\nnext. The lump of sheets was on the ground, and Coppinger was on all\nfours beside it. He was pretty nearly mad with excitement.\n\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked him.\n\n\"I don't know yet. But it is the most valuable find ever made in the\nCanary Islands, and it's yours, you unappreciative beggar; at least what\nthere is left of it. Oh, man, man, you've smashed up the beginning, and\nyou've smashed up the end of some history that is probably priceless.\nIt's my own fault. I ought to have known better than set an untrained\nman to do important exploring work.\"\n\n\"I should say it's your fault if anything's gone wrong. You said there\nwas no such thing as writing known to these ancient Canarios, and I\ntook your word for it. For anything I knew the stuff might have been\nsomething to eat.\"\n\n\"It isn't Guanche work at all,\" said he testily. \"You ought to have\nknown that from the talc. Great heavens, man, have you no eyes? Haven't\nyou seen the general formation of the island? Don't you know there's no\ntalc here?\"\n\n\"I'm no geologist. Is this imported literature then?\"\n\n\"Of course. It's Egyptian: that's obvious at a glance. Though how\nit's got here I can't tell yet. It isn't stuff you can read off like\na newspaper. The character's a variant on any of those that have been\ndiscovered so far. And as for this waxy stuff spread over the talc,\nit's unique. It's some sort of a mineral, I think: perhaps asphalt. It\ndoesn't scratch up like animal wax. I'll analyse that later. Why they\nonce invented it, and then let such a splendid notion drop out of use,\nis just a marvel. I could stay gloating over this all day.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"if it's all the same for you, I'd rather gloat over a\nmeal. It's a good ten miles hard going to the fonda, and I'm as hungry\nas a hawk already. Look here, do you know it is four o'clock already?\nIt takes longer than you think climbing down to each of these caves, and\nthen getting up again for the next.\"\n\nCoppinger spread his coat on the ground, and wrapped the lump of sheets\nwith tender care, but would not allow it to be tied with a rope for fear\nof breaking more of the edges. He insisted on carrying it himself too,\nand did so for the larger part of the way to Santa Brigida, and it was\nonly when he was within an ace of dropping himself with sheer tiredness\nthat he condescended to let me take my turn. He was tolerably ungracious\nabout it too. \"I suppose you may as well carry the stuff,\" he snapped,\n\"seeing that after all it's your own.\"\n\nPersonally, when we got to the fonda, I had as good a dinner as was\nprocurable, and a bottle of that old Canary wine, and turned into bed\nafter a final pipe. Coppinger dined also, but I have reason to believe\nhe did not sleep much. At any rate I found him still poring over the\nfind next morning, and looking very heavy-eyed, but brimming with\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he said, \"that you've blundered upon the most valuable\nhistorical manuscript that the modern world has ever yet seen? Of\ncourse, with your clumsy way of getting it out, you've done an infinity\nof damage. For instance, those top sheets you shelled away and\nspoiled, contained probably an absolutely unique account of the ancient\ncivilisation of Yucatan.\"\n\n\"Where's that, anyway?\"\n\n\"In the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. It's all ruins to-day, but once it\nwas a very prosperous colony of the Atlanteans.\"\n\n\"Never heard of them. Oh yes, I have though. They were the people\nHerodotus wrote about, didn't he? But I thought they were mythical.\"\n\n\"They were very real, and so was Atlantis, the continent where they\nlived, which lay just north of the Canaries here.\"\n\n\"What's that crocodile sort of thing with wings drawn in the margin?\"\n\n\"Some sort of beast that lived in those bygone days. The pages are full\nof them. That's a cave-tiger. And that's some sort of colossal bat.\nThank goodness he had the sense to illustrate fully, the man who wrote\nthis, or we should never have been able to reconstruct the tale, or at\nany rate we could not have understood half of it. Whole species have\ndied out since this was written, just as a whole continent has been\nswept away and three civilisations quenched. The worst of it is, it was\nwritten by a highly-educated man who somewhat naturally writes a very\nbad fist. I've hammered at it all the night through, and have only\nmanaged to make out a few sentences here and there\"--he rubbed his hands\nappreciatively. \"It will take me a year's hard work to translate this\nproperly.\"\n\n\"Every man to his taste. I'm afraid my interest in the thing wouldn't\nlast as long as that. But how did it get there? Did your ancient\nEgyptian come to Grand Canary for the good of his lungs, and write it\nbecause he felt dull up in that cave?\"\n\n\"I made a mistake there. The author was not an Egyptian. It was the\nsimilarity of the inscribed character which misled me. The book was\nwritten by one Deucalion, who seems to have been a priest or general--or\nperhaps both--and he was an Atlantean. How it got there, I don't know\nyet. Probably that was told in the last few pages, which a certain\nvandal smashed up with his pocketknife, in getting them away from the\nplace where they were stowed.\"\n\n\"That's right, abuse me. Deucalion you say? There was a Deucalion in the\nGreek mythology. He was one of the two who escaped from the Flood: their\nNoah, in fact.\"\n\n\"The swamping of the continent of Atlantis might very well correspond to\nthe Flood.\"\n\n\"Is there a Pyrrha then? She was Deucalion's wife.\"\n\n\"I haven't come across her yet. But there's a Phorenice, who may be the\nsame. She seems to have been the reigning Empress, as far as I can make\nout at present.\"\n\nI looked with interest at illustrations in the margin. They were quite\nunderstandable, although the perspective was all wrong. \"Weird beasts\nthey seem to have had knocking about the country in those days. Whacking\nbig size too, if one may judge. By Jove, that'll be a cave-tiger trying\nto puff down a mammoth. I shouldn't care to have lived in those days.\"\n\n\"Probably they had some way of fighting the creatures. However, that\nwill show itself as I get along with the translation.\" He looked at his\nwatch--\"I suppose I ought to be ashamed of myself, but I haven't been to\nbed. Are you going out?\"\n\n\"I shall drive back to Las Palmas. I promised a man to have a round at\ngolf this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Very well, see you at dinner. I hope they've sent back my dress shirts\nfrom the wash. O, lord! I am sleepy.\"\n\nI left him going up to bed, and went outside and ordered a carriage to\ntake me down, and there I may say we parted for a considerable time.\nA cable was waiting for me in the hotel at Las Palmas to go home for\nbusiness forthwith, and there was a Liverpool boat in the harbour which\nI just managed to catch as she was steaming out. It was a close thing,\nand the boatmen made a small fortune out of my hurry.\n\nNow Coppinger was only an hotel acquaintance, and as I was up to the\neyes in work when I got back to England, I'm afraid I didn't think very\nmuch more about him at the time. One doesn't with people one just meets\ncasually abroad like that. And it must have been at least a year later\nthat I saw by a paragraph in one of the papers, that he had given the\nlump of sheets to the British Museum, and that the estimated worth of\nthem was ten thousand pounds at the lowest valuation.\n\nWell, this was a bit of revelation, and as he had so repeatedly\nimpressed on me that the things were mine by right of discovery, I wrote\nrather a pointed note to him mentioning that he seemed to have been\nmaking rather free with my property. Promptly came back a stilted letter\nbeginning, \"Doctor Coppinger regrets\" and so on, and with it the English\ntranslation of the wax-upon-talc MSS. He \"quite admitted\" my claim,\nand \"trusted that the profits of publication would be a sufficient\nreimbursement for any damage received.\"\n\nNow I had no idea that he would take me unpleasantly like this, and\nwrote back a pretty warm reply to that effect; but the only answer I got\nto this was through a firm of solicitors, who stated that all further\ncommunications with Dr. Coppinger must be made through them.\n\nI will say here publicly that I regret the line he has taken over the\nmatter; but as the affair has gone so far, I am disposed to follow out\nhis proposition. Accordingly the old history is here printed; the credit\n(and the responsibility) of the translation rests with Dr. Coppinger;\nand whatever revenue accrues from readers, goes to the finder of the\noriginal talc-upon-wax sheets, myself.\n\nIf there is a further alteration in this arrangement, it will be\nannounced publicly at a later date. But at present this appears to be\nmost unlikely.\n\n\n\n\n1. MY RECALL\n\n\nThe public official reception was over. The sentence had been read, the\nname of Phorenice, the Empress, adored, and the new Viceroy installed\nwith all that vast and ponderous ceremonial which had gained its pomp\nand majesty from the ages. Formally, I had delivered up the reins of my\ngovernment; formally, Tatho had seated himself on the snake-throne, and\nhad put over his neck the chain of gems which symbolised the supreme\noffice; and then, whilst the drums and the trumpets made their\nproclamation of clamour, he had risen to his feet, for his first state\nprogress round that gilded council chamber as Viceroy of the Province of\nYucatan.\n\nWith folded arms and bended head, I followed him between the glittering\nlines of soldiers, and the brilliant throng of courtiers, and chiefs,\nand statesmen. The roof-beams quivered to the cries of \"Long Live\nTatho!\" \"Flourish the Empress!\" which came forth as in duty bound, and\nthe new ruler acknowledged the welcome with stately inclinations of\nthe head. In turn he went to the three lesser thrones of the lesser\ngovernors--in the East, the North, and the South, and received homage\nfrom each as the ritual was; and I, the man whom his coming had deposed,\nfollowed with the prescribed meekness in his train.\n\nIt was a hard task, but we who hold the higher offices learn to carry\nbefore the people a passionless face. Once, twenty years before, these\nsame fine obeisances had been made to me; now the Gods had seen fit to\nmake fortune change. But as I walked bent and humbly on behind the heels\nof Tatho, though etiquette forbade noisy salutations to myself, it could\nnot inhibit kindly glances, and these came from every soldier, every\ncourtier, and every chief who stood there in that gilded hall, and\nthey fell upon me very gratefully. It is not often the fallen meet such\ntender looks.\n\nThe form goes, handed down from immemorial custom, that on these great\nceremonial days of changing a ruler, those of the people being present\nmay bring forward petitions and requests; may make accusations against\ntheir retiring head with sure immunity from his vengeance; or may state\ntheir own private theories for the better government of the State in the\nfuture. I think it may be pardoned to my vanity if I record that not a\nvoice was raised against me, or against any of the items of my twenty\nyears of rule. Nor did any speak out for alterations in the future.\nYes, even though we made the circuit for the three prescribed times, all\npresent showed their approval in generous silence.\n\nThen, one behind the other, the new Viceroy and the old, we marched with\nformal step over golden tiles of that council hall beneath the pyramid,\nand the great officers of state left their stations and joined in our\ntrain; and at the farther wall we came to the door of those private\nchambers which an hour ago had been mine own.\n\nAh, well! I had no home now in any of those wondrous cities of Yucatan,\nand I could not help feeling a bitterness, though in sooth I should have\nbeen thankful enough to return to the Continent of Atlantis with my head\nstill in its proper station.\n\nTatho gave his formal summons of \"Open ye to the Viceroy,\" which the\nritual commands, and the slaves within sent the massive stone valves of\nthe door gaping wide. Tatho entered, I at his heels; the others halted,\nsending valedictions from the threshold; and the valves of the door\nclanged on the lock behind us. We passed on to the chamber beyond, and\nthen, when for the first time we were alone together, and the forced\netiquette of courts was behind us, the new Viceroy turned with meekly\nfolded arms, and bowed low before me.\n\n\"Deucalion,\" he said, \"believe me that I have not sought this office. It\nwas thrust upon me. Had I not accepted, my head would have paid forfeit,\nand another man--your enemy--would have been sent out as viceroy in\nyour place. The Empress does not permit that her will shall ever be\nquestioned.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" I made answer, \"my brother in all but blood, there is no\nman living in all Atlantis or her territories to whom I had liefer hand\nover my government. For twenty years now have I ruled this country\nof Yucatan, and Mexico beyond, first under the old King, and then\nas minister to this new Empress. I know my colony like a book. I am\nintimate with all her wonderful cities, with their palaces, their\npyramids, and their people. I have hunted the beasts and the savages in\nthe forests. I have built roads, and made the rivers so that they will\ncarry shipping. I have fostered the arts and crafts like a merchant; I\nhave discoursed, three times each day, the cult of the Gods with\nmine own lips. Through evil years and through good have I ruled here,\nstriving only for the prosperity of the land and the strengthening of\nAtlantis, and I have grown to love the peoples like a father. To you I\nbequeath them, Tatho, with tender supplications for their interests.\"\n\n\"It is not I that can carry on Deucalion's work with Deucalion's power,\nbut rest content, my friend, that I shall do my humble best to follow\nexactly on in your footsteps. Believe me, I came out to this government\nwith a thousand regrets, but I would have died sooner than take your\nplace had I known how vigorously the supplanting would trouble you.\"\n\n\"We are alone here,\" I said, \"away from the formalities of formal\nassemblies, and a man may give vent to his natural self without fear of\ntarnishing a ceremony. Your coming was something of the suddenest.\nTill an hour ago, when you demanded audience, I had thought to rule on\nlonger; and even now I do not know for what cause I am deposed.\"\n\n\"The proclamation said: 'We relieve our well-beloved Deucalion of his\npresent service, because we have great need of his powers at home in our\nkingdom of Atlantis.'\"\n\n\"A mere formality.\"\n\nTatho looked uneasily round the hangings of the chamber, and drew me\nwith him to its centre, and lowered his voice.\n\n\"I do not think so,\" he whispered. \"I believe she has need of you. There\nare troublous times on hand, and Phorenice wants the ablest men in the\nkingdom ready to her call.\"\n\n\"You may speak openly,\" I said, \"and without fear of eavesdroppers.\nWe are in the heart of the pyramid here, built in every way by a man's\nlength of solid stone. Myself, I oversaw the laying of every course.\nAnd besides, here in Yucatan, we have not the niceties of your old world\ndiplomacy, and do not listen, because we count it shame to do so.\"\n\nTatho shrugged his shoulders. \"I acted only according to mine education.\nAt home, a loose tongue makes a loose head, and there are those whose\ntrade it is to carry tales. Still, what I say is this: The throne\nshakes, and Phorenice sees the need of sturdy props. So she has sent\nthis proclamation.\"\n\n\"But why come to me? It is twenty years since I sailed to this colony,\nand from that day I have not returned to Atlantis once. I know little of\nthe old country's politics. What small parcel of news drifts out to us\nacross the ocean, reads with slender interest here. Yucatan is another\nworld, my dear Tatho, as you in the course of your government will\nlearn, with new interests, new people, new everything. To us here,\nAtlantis is only a figment, a shadow, far away across the waters. It\nis for this new world of Yucatan that I have striven through all these\nyears.\"\n\n\"If Deucalion has small time to spare from his government for brooding\nover his fatherland, Atlantis, at least, has found leisure to admire\nthe deeds of her brilliant son. Why, sir, over yonder at home, your name\ncarries magic with it. When you and I were lads together, it was the\ncustom in the colleges to teach that the men of the past were the\ngreatest this world has ever seen; but to-day this teaching is changed.\nIt is Deucalion who is held up as the model and example. Mothers name\ntheir sons Deucalion, as the most valuable birth-gift they can make.\nDeucalion is a household word. Indeed, there is only one name that is\nnear to it in familiarity.\"\n\n\"You trouble me,\" I said, frowning. \"I have tried to do my duty for its\nown sake, and for the country's sake, not for the pattings and fondlings\nof the vulgar. And besides, if there are names to be in every one's\nmouth, they should be the names of the Gods.\"\n\nTatho shrugged his shoulders. \"The Gods? They occupy us very little\nthese latter years. With our modern science, we have grown past the\ntether of the older Gods, and no new one has appeared. No, my Lord\nDeucalion, if it were merely the Gods who were your competitors on men's\nlips, your name would be a thousand times the better known.\"\n\n\"Of mere human names,\" I said, \"the name of this new Empress should come\nfirst in Atlantis, our lord the old King being now dead.\"\n\n\"She certainly would have it so,\" replied Tatho, and there was something\nin his tone which made me see that more was meant behind the words. I\ndrew him to one of the marble seats, and bent myself familiarly towards\nhim. \"I am speaking,\" I said, \"not to the new Viceroy of Yucatan, but\nto my old friend Tatho, a member of the Priests' Clan, like myself, with\nwhom I worked side by side in a score of the smaller home governments,\nin hamlets, in villages, in smaller towns, in greater towns, as we\ngained experience in war and knowledge in the art of ruling people, and\nso tediously won our promotion. I am speaking in Tatho's private abode,\nthat was mine own not two hours since, and I would have an answer with\nthat plainness which we always then used to one another.\"\n\nThe new Viceroy sighed whimsically. \"I almost forget how to speak in\nplain words now,\" he said. \"We have grown so polished in these latter\ndays, that mere bald truth would be hissed as indelicate. But for the\nmemory of those early years, when we expended as much law and thought\nover the ownership of a hay-byre as we should now over the fate of a\nrebellious city, I will try and speak plain to you even now, Deucalion.\nTell me, old friend, what is it?\"\n\n\"What of this new Empress?\"\n\nHe frowned. \"I might have guessed your subject,\" he said.\n\n\n\"Then speak upon it. Tell me of all the changes that have been made.\nWhat has this Phorenice done to make her throne unstable in Atlantis?\"\n\nTatho frowned still. \"If I did not know you to be as honest as our Lord\nthe Sun, your questions would carry mischief with them. Phorenice has a\nshort way with those who are daring enough to discuss her policies for\nother purpose than politely to praise them.\"\n\n\"You can leave me ignorant if you wish,\" I said with a touch of chill.\nThis Tatho seemed to be different from the Tatho I had known at home,\nTatho my workmate, Tatho who had read with me in the College of Priests,\nwho had run with me in many a furious charge, who had laboured with me\nso heavily that the peoples under us might prosper. But he was quick\nenough to see my change of tone.\n\n\"You force me back to my old self,\" he said with a half smile, \"though\nit is hard enough to forget the caution one has learned during the last\ntwenty years, even when speaking with you. Still, whatever may have\nhappened to the rest of us, it is clear to see that you at least have\nnot changed, and, old friend, I am ready to trust you with my life if\nyou ask it. In fact, you do ask me that very thing when you tell me to\nspeak all I know of Phorenice.\"\n\nI nodded. This was more like the old times, when there was full\nconfidence between us. \"The Gods will it now that I return to Atlantis,\"\nI said, \"and what happens after that the Gods alone know. But it would\nbe of service to me if I could land on her shores with some knowledge of\nthis Phorenice, for at present I am as ignorant concerning her as some\nsavage from Europe or mid-Africa.\"\n\n\"What would you have me tell?\"\n\n\"Tell all. I know only that she, a woman, reigns, whereby the ancient\nlaw of the land, a man should rule; that she is not even of the Priestly\nClan from which the law says all rulers must be drawn; and that, from\nwhat you say, she has caused the throne to totter. The throne was as\nfirm as the everlasting hills in the old King's day, Tatho.\"\n\n\"History has moved with pace since then, and Phorenice has spurred it.\nYou know her origin?\"\n\n\"I know only the exact little I have told you.\"\n\n\"She was a swineherd's daughter from the mountains, though this is never\neven whispered now, as she has declared herself to be a daughter of the\nGods, with a miraculous birth and upbringing. As she has decreed it a\nsacrilege to question this parentage, and has ordered to be burnt all\nthose that seem to recollect her more earthly origin, the fable passes\ncurrent for truth. You see the faith I put in you, Deucalion, by telling\nyou what you wish to learn.\"\n\n\"There has always been trust between us.\"\n\n\"I know; but this habit of suspicion is hard to cast off, even with you.\nHowever, let me put your good faith between me and the torture further.\nZaemon, you remember, was governor of the swineherd's province, and\nZaemon's wife saw Phorenice and took her away to adopt and bring up as\nher own. It is said that the swineherd and his woman objected; perhaps\nthey did; anyway, I know they died; and Phorenice was taught the arts\nand graces, and brought up as a daughter of the Priestly Clan.\"\n\n\"But still she was an adopted daughter only,\" I objected.\n\n\"The omission of the 'adopted' was her will at an early age,\" said Tatho\ndryly, \"and she learnt early to have her wishes carried into fact. It\nwas notorious that before she had grown to fifteen years she ruled not\nonly the women of the household, but Zaemon also, and the province that\nwas beyond Zaemon.\"\n\n\"Zaemon was learned,\" I said, \"and a devout follower of the Gods, and\nsearcher into the higher mysteries; but, as a ruler, he was always a\nflabby fellow.\"\n\n\"I do not say that opportunities have not come usefully in Phorenice's\nway, but she has genius as well. For her to have raised herself at all\nfrom what she was, was remarkable. Not one woman out of a thousand,\nplaced as she was, would have grown to be aught higher than a mere wife\nof some sturdy countryman, who was sufficiently simple to care nothing\nfor pedigree. But look at Phorenice: it was her whim to take exercise\nas a man-at-arms and practise with all the utensils of war; and then,\nbefore any one quite knows how or why it happened, a rebellion had\nbroken out in the province, and here was she, a slip of a girl, leading\nZaemon's troops.\"\n\n\"Zaemon, when I knew him, was a mere derision in the field.\"\n\n\"Hear me on. Phorenice put down the rebellion in masterly fashion, and\ngave the conquered a choice between sword and service. They fell into\nher ranks at once, and were faithful to her from that moment. I tell\nyou, Deucalion, there is a marvellous fascination about the woman.\"\n\n\"Her present historian seems to have felt it.\"\n\n\"Of course I have. Every one who sees her comes under her spell. And\nfrankly, I am in love with her also, and look upon my coming here as\ndetestable exile. Every one near to Phorenice, high and low, loves her\njust the same, even though they know it may be her whim to send them to\nexecution next minute.\"\n\nPerhaps I let my scorn of this appear.\n\n\"You feel contempt for our weakness? You were always a strong man,\nDeucalion.\"\n\n\"At any rate you see me still unmarried. I have found no time to palter\nwith the fripperies of women.\"\n\n\"Ah, but these colonists here are crude and unfascinating. Wait till you\nsee the ladies of the court, my ascetic.\"\n\n\"It comes to my mind,\" I said dryly, \"that I lived in Atlantis before I\ncame out here, and at that time I used to see as much of court life as\nmost men. Yet then, also, I felt no inducement to marry.\"\n\nTatho chuckled. \"Atlantis has changed so that you would hardly know the\ncountry to-day. A new era has come over everything, especially over\nthe other sex. Well do I remember the women of the old King's time, how\nmonstrous uncomely they were, how little they knew how to walk or carry\nthemselves, how painfully barbaric was their notion of dress. I dare\nswear that your ladies here in Yucatan are not so provincial to-day as\nours were then. But you should see them now at home. They are delicious.\nAnd above all in charm is the Empress. Oh, Deucalion, you shall see\nPhorenice in all her glorious beauty and her magnificence one of these\nfine days soon, and believe me you will go down on your knees and\nrepent.\"\n\n\"I may see, and (because you say so) I may alter my life's ways. The\nGods make all things possible. But for the present I remain as I am,\ncelibate, and not wishful to be otherwise; and so in the meantime I\nwould hear the continuance of your history.\"\n\n\"It is one long story of success. She deposed Zaemon from his government\nin name as well as in fact, and the news was spread, and the Priestly\nClan rose in its wrath. The two neighbouring governors were bidden join\nforces, take her captive, and bring her for execution. Poor men! They\ntried to obey their orders; they attacked her surely enough, but in\nbattle she could laugh at them. She killed both, and made some slaughter\namongst their troops; and to those that remained alive and became her\nprisoners, she made her usual offer--the sword or service. Naturally\nthey were not long over making their choice: to these common people one\nruler is much the same as another: and so again her army was reinforced.\n\n\"Three times were bodies of soldiery sent against her, and three times\nwas she victorious. The last was a final effort. Before, it had been\ncustomary to despise this adventuress who had sprung up so suddenly. But\nthen the priests began to realise their peril; to see that the throne\nitself was in danger; and to know that if she were to be crushed, they\nwould have to put forth their utmost. Every man who could carry arms was\npressed into the service. Every known art of war was ordered to be put\ninto employment. It was the largest army, and the best equipped army\nthat Atlantis then had ever raised, and the Priestly Clan saw fit to put\nin supreme command their general, Tatho.\"\n\n\"You!\" I cried.\n\n\"Even myself, Deucalion. And mark you, I fought my utmost. I was not her\ncreature then; and when I set out (because they wanted to spur me to the\nuttermost) the High Council of the priests pointed out my prospects. The\nKing we had known so long, was ailing and wearily old; he was so wrapped\nup in the study of the mysteries, and the joy of closely knowing them,\nthat earthly matters had grown nauseous to him; and at any time he might\ndecide to die. The Priestly Clan uses its own discretion in the election\nof a new king, but it takes note of popular sentiment; and a general who\nat the critical time could come home victorious from a great campaign,\nwhich moreover would release a harassed people from the constant\napplication of arms, would be the idol of the moment. These things were\npointed out to me solemnly and in the full council.\"\n\n\"What! They promised you the throne?\"\n\n\"Even that. So you see I set out with a high stake before me. Phorenice\nI had never seen, and I swore to take her alive, and give her to be the\nsport of my soldiery. I had a fine confidence in my own strategy then,\nDeucalion. But the old Gods, in whom I trusted then, remained old,\ntaught me no new thing. I drilled and exercised my army according to the\nforms you and I learnt together, old comrade, and in many a tough fight\nfound to serve well; I armed them with the choicest weapons we knew of\nthen, with sling and mace, with bow and spear, with axe and knife, with\nsword and the throwing fire; their bodies I covered with metal plates;\neven their bellies I cared for, with droves of cattle driven in the rear\nof the fighting troops.\n\n\"But when the encounter came, they might have been men of straw for all\nthe harm they did. Out of her own brain Phorenice had made fire-tubes\nthat cast a dart which would kill beyond two bowshots, and the fashion\nin which she handled her troops dazzled me. They threatened us on one\nflank, they harassed us on the other. It was not war as we had been\naccustomed to. It was a newer and more deadly game, and I had to watch\nmy splendid army eaten away as waves eat a sandhill. Never once did I\nget a chance of forcing close action. These new tactics that had come\nfrom Phorenice's invention, were beyond my art to meet or understand. We\nwere eight to her one, and our close-packed numbers only made us so much\nthe more easy for slaughter. A panic came, and those who could fled.\nMyself, I had no wish to go back and earn the axe that waits for the\nunsuccessful general. I tried to die there fighting where I stood. But\ndeath would not come. It was a fine melee, Deucalion, that last one.\"\n\n\"And so she took you?\"\n\n\"I stood with three others back to back, with a ring of dead round us,\nand a ring of the enemy hemming us in. We taunted them to come on. But\nat hand-to-hand courtesies we had shown we could hold our own, and so\nthey were calling for fire-tubes with which they could strike us down\nin safety from a distance. Then up came Phorenice. 'What is this to-do?'\nsays she. 'We seek to kill Lord Tatho, who led against you,' say they.\n'So that is Tatho?' says she. 'A fine figure of a man indeed, and a\npretty fighter seemingly, after the old manner. Doubtless he is one\nwho would acquire the newer method. See now Tatho,' says she, 'it is my\ncustom to offer those I vanquish either the sword (which, believe me,\nwas never nearer your neck than now) or service under my banner. Will\nyou make a choice?'\n\n\"'Woman,' I said, 'fairest that ever I saw, finest general the world\nhas ever borne, you tempt me sorely by your qualities, but there is a\ntradition in our Clan, that we should be true to the salt we eat. I am\nthe King's man still, and so I can take no service from you.'\n\n\"'The King is dead,' says she. 'A runner has just brought the tidings,\nmeaning them to have fallen into your hands. And I am the Empress.'\n\n\"'Who made you Empress?' I asked.\n\n\"'The same most capable hand that has given me this battle,' says she.\n'It is a capable hand, as you have seen: it can be a kind hand also, as\nyou may learn if you choose. With the King dead, Tatho is a masterless\nman now. Is Tatho in want of a mistress?'\n\n\"'Such a glorious mistress as you,' I said, 'Yes.' And from that moment,\nDeucalion, I have been her slave. Oh, you may frown; you may get up from\nthis seat and walk away if you will. But I ask you this: keep back your\nworst judgment of me, old friend, till after you have seen Phorenice\nherself in the warm and lovely flesh. Then your own ears and your own\nsenses will be my advocates, to win me back your old esteem.\"\n\n\n\n\n2. BACK TO ATLANTIS\n\n\nThe words of Tatho were no sleeping draught for me that night. I began\nto think that I had made somewhat a mistake in wrapping myself up so\nentirely in my government of Yucatan, and not contriving to keep more in\ntouch with events that were passing at home in Atlantis. For many years\npast it had been easy to see that the mariner folk who did traffic\nacross the seas spoke with restraint, and that only what news the\nEmpress pleased was allowed to ooze out beyond her borders. But, as\nI say, I was fully occupied with my work in the colony, and had no\ncuriosity to pull away a veil intentionally placed. Besides, it has\nalways been against my principles to put to the torture men who had\nreceived orders for silence from their superiors, merely that they shall\nbreak these orders for my private convenience.\n\nHowever, the iron discipline of our Priestly Clan left me no choice\nof procedure. As was customary, I had been deprived of my office at a\nmoment's notice. From that time on, all papers and authority belonged to\nmy successor, and, although by courtesy I might be permitted to remain\nas a guest in the pyramid that had so recently been mine, to see another\nsunrise, it was clearly enjoined that I must leave the territory then at\nthe topmost of my speed and hasten to report in Atlantis.\n\nTatho, to give him credit, was anxious to further my interests to the\nutmost in his power. He was by my side again before the dawn, putting\nall his resources at my disposal.\n\nI had little enough to ask him. \"A ship to take me home,\" I said, \"and I\nshall be your debtor.\"\n\nThe request seemed to surprise him. \"That you may certainly have if you\nwish it. But my ships are foul with the long passage, and are in need\nof a careen. If you take them, you will make a slow voyage of it to\nAtlantis. Why do you not take your own navy? The ships are in harbour\nnow, for I saw them there when we came in. Brave ships they are too.\"\n\n\"But not mine. That navy belongs to Yucatan.\"\n\n\"Well, Deucalion, you are Yucatan; or, rather, you were yesterday, and\nhave been these twenty years.\"\n\nI saw what he meant, and the idea did not please me. I answered stiffly\nenough that the ships were owned by private merchants, or belonged to\nthe State, and I could not claim so much as a ten-slave galley.\n\nTatho shrugged his shoulders. \"I suppose you know your own policies\nbest,\" he said, \"though to me it seems but risky for a man who has\nattained to a position like yours and mine not to have provided himself\nwith a stout navy of his own. One never knows when a recall may be sent,\nand, through lack of these precautions, a life's earnings may very well\nbe lost in a dozen hours.\"\n\n\"I have no fear for mine,\" I said coldly.\n\n\"Of course not, because you know me to be your friend. But had another\nman been appointed to this vice-royalty, you might have been sadly\nshorn, Deucalion. It is not many fellows who can resist a snug hoard\nready and waiting in the very coffers they have come to line.\"\n\n\"My Lord Tatho,\" I said, \"it is clear to me that you and I have grown to\nbe of different tastes. All of the hoard that I have made for myself in\nthis colony, few men would covet. I have the poor clothes you see me\nin this moment, and a box of drugs such as I have found useful to the\nstomach. I possess also three slaves, two of them scribes and the third\na sturdy savage from Europe, who cooks my victual and fills for me the\nbath. For my maintenance during my years of service, here, I have bled\nthe State of a soldier's ration and nothing beyond; and if in my name\nany man has mulcted a creature in Yucatan of so much as an ounce of\nbronze, I request you as a last service to have that man hanged for me\nas a liar and a thief.\"\n\nTatho looked at me curiously. \"I do not know whether I admire you most\nor whether I pity. I do not know whether to be astonished or to despise.\nWe had heard of much of your uprightness over yonder in Atlantis, of\nyour sternness and your justice, but I swear by the old Gods that no\nsoul guessed you carried your fancy so far as this. Why, man, money is\npower. With money and the resources money can buy, nothing could stop\na fellow like you; whilst without it you may be tripped up and trodden\ndown irrevocably at the first puny reverse.\"\n\n\"The Gods will choose my fate.\"\n\n\"Possibly; but for mine, I prefer to nourish it myself. I tell you with\nfrankness that I have not come here to follow in the pattern you have\nmade for a vice-royalty. I shall govern Yucatan wisely and well to the\nbest of my ability; but I shall govern it also for the good of Tatho,\nthe viceroy. I have brought with me here my navy of eight ships and a\npersonal bodyguard. There is my wife also, and her women and her slaves.\nAll these must be provided for. And why indeed should it be otherwise?\nIf a people is to be governed, it should be their privilege to pay\nhandsomely for their prince.\"\n\n\"We shall not agree on this. You have the power now, and can employ it\nas you choose. If I thought it would be of any use, I should like to\nsupplicate you most humbly to deal with lenience when you come to tax\nthese people who are under you. They have grown very dear to me.\"\n\n\"I have disgusted you with me, and I am grieved for it. But even to\nretain your good opinion, Deucalion--which I value more than that of any\nman living--I cannot do here as you have done. It would be impossible,\neven if I wished it. You must not judge all other men by your own\nstrong standard: a Tatho is by no means a colossus like a Deucalion. And\nbesides, I have a wife and children, and they must be provided for, even\nif I neglect myself.\"\n\n\"Ah, there,\" I said, \"it does seem that I possess the advantage. I have\nno wife, to clog me.\"\n\nHe caught up my word quickly. \"It seems to me you have nothing that\nmakes life worth living. You have neither wife, children, riches, cooks,\nretinue, dresses, nor anything else in proportion to your station. You\nwill pardon my saying it, old comrade, but you are plaguey ignorant\nabout some matters. For example, you do not know how to dine. During\nevery day of a very weary voyage, I have promised myself when sitting\nbefore the meagre sea victual, that presently the abstinence would be\nmore than repaid by Deucalion's welcoming feast. Oh, I tell you that\nfeast was one of the vividest things that ever came before my eyes. And\nthen when we get to the actuality, what was it? Why, a country farmer\nevery day sits down to more delicate fare. You told me how it was\nprepared. Well, your savage from Europe may be lusty, and perchance is\nfaithful, but he is a devil-possessed cook. Gods! I have lived better on\na campaign.\n\n\"I know this is a colony here, without any of the home refinements; but\nif in the days to come, the deer of the forest, the fish of the stream,\nand the other resources of the place are not put to better use than\nheretofore, I shall see it my duty as ruler to fry some of the\nkitchen staff alive in grease so as to encourage better cookery. Gods!\nDeucalion, have you forgotten what it is to have a palate? And have\nyou no esteem for your own dignity? Man, look at your clothes. You are\ngarbed like a herdsman, and you have not a gaud or a jewel to brighten\nyou.\"\n\n\"I eat,\" I said coldly, \"when my hunger bids me, and I carry this one\nrobe upon my person till it is worn out and needs replacement. The\ngrossness of excessive banqueting, and the effeminacy of many clothes\nare attainments that never met my fancy. But I think we have talked here\nover long, and there seems little chance of our finding agreement. You\nhave changed, Tatho, with the years, and perhaps I have changed also.\nThese alterations creep imperceptibly into one's being as time advances.\nLet us part now, and, forgetting these present differences, remember\nonly our friendship of twenty years agone. That for me, at any rate, has\nalways had a pleasant savour when called up into the memory.\"\n\nTatho bowed his head. \"So be it,\" he said.\n\n\"And I would still charge myself upon your bounty for that ship. Dawn\ncannot be far off now, and it is not decent that the man who has ruled\nhere so long, should walk in daylight through the streets on the morning\nafter his dismissal.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said Tatho. \"You shall have my poor navy. I could have\nwished that you had asked me something greater.\"\n\n\"Not the navy, Tatho; one small ship. Believe me, more is wasted.\"\n\n\"Now, there,\" said Tatho, \"I shall act the tyrant. I am viceroy here\nnow, and will have my way in this. You may go naked of all possessions:\nthat I cannot help. But depart for Atlantis unattended, that you shall\nnot.\"\n\nAnd so, in fine, as the choice was set beyond me, it was in the \"Bear,\"\nTatho's own private ship, with all the rest of his navy sailing in\nescort, that I did finally make my transit.\n\nBut the start was not immediate. The vessels lay moored against the\nstone quays of the inner harbour, gutted of their stores, and with crews\nexhausted, and it would have been suicide to have forced them out then\nand there to again take the seas.\n\nSo the courtesies were fulfilled by the craft whereon I abode hauling\nout into the entrance basin, and anchoring there in the swells of the\nfairway; and forthwith she and her consorts took in wood and water,\ncured meat and fish ashore, and refitted in all needful ways, with all\nspeed attainable.\n\nFor myself there came then, as the first time during twenty busy years,\na breathing space from work. I had no further connection with the\ncountry of my labours; indeed, officially, I had left it already. Into\nthe working of the ship it was contrary to rule that I should make\nany inspection or interest, since all sea matters were the exclusive\nproperty of the Mariners' Guild, secured to them by royal patent, and\nmost jealously guarded.\n\nSo there remained to me in my day, hours to gaze (if I would) upon the\nquays, the harbours, the palaces, and the pyramids of the splendid city\nbefore me which I had seen grow stone by stone from its foundations; or\nto roam my eye over the pastures and the grain lands beyond the walls,\nand to look longingly at the dense forests behind, from which field by\nfield we had so tediously ripped our territory.\n\nWould Tatho continue the work so healthily begun? I trusted so, even in\nspite of his selfish words. And at all hours, during the radiance of\nour Lord the Sun, or under the stars of night, I was free to pursue\nthat study of the higher mysteries, on which we of the Priests' Clan are\ntrained to set our minds, without aid of book or instrument, of image or\ntemple.\n\nThe refitting of the navy was gone about with speed. Never, it is said,\nhad ships been reprovisioned and caulked, and remanned with greater\nspeed for the over-ocean voyage. Indeed, it was barely over a month from\nthe day that they brought up in the harbour, they put out beyond the\nwalls, and began their voyage eastward over the hills and dale of the\nocean.\n\nRowing-slaves from Europe for this long passage of sea are not taken\nnow, owing to the difficulty in provisioning them, for modern humanity\nforbids the practice of letting them eat one another according to the\nhome custom of their continent; sails alone are but an indifferent stand\nby; but modern science has shown how to extract force from the Sun, when\nHe is free from cloud, and this (in a manner kept secret by mariners) is\nmade to draw sea-water at the forepart of the vessel, and eject it with\nsuch force at the stern that she is appreciably driven forward, even\nwith the wind adverse.\n\nIn another matter also has navigation vastly improved. It is not\nnecessary now, as formerly, to trust wholly to a starry night (when\nbeyond sight of land) to find direction. A little image has been made,\nand is stood balanced in the forepart of every vessel, with an arm\noutstretched, pointing constantly to the direction where the Southern\nCross lies in the Heavens. So, by setting an angle, can a just course be\ncorrectly steered. Other instruments have they also for finding a true\nposition on the ocean wastes, for the newer mariner, when he is at sea,\nputs little trust in the Gods, and confides mightily in his own thews\nand wits.\n\nStill, it is amusing to see these tarry fellows, even in this modern\nday, take their last farewell of the harbour town. The ship is stowed,\nand all ready for sea, and they wash and put on all their bravery of\nattire. Ashore they go, their faces long with piety, and seek some\nobscure temple whose God has little flavour with shore folk, and here\nthey make sacrifice with clamour and lavish outlay. And, finally, there\nfollows a feast in honour of the God, and they arrive back on board, and\nput to sea for the most part drunken, and all heavy and evil-humoured\nwith gluttony and their other excesses.\n\nThe voyage was very different to my previous sea-going. There was no\ncreeping timorously along in touch with the coasts. We stood straight\nacross the open gulf in the direction of home, came up with the band of\nthe Carib Islands, and worked confidently through them, as though they\nhad been signposts to mark the sea highway; and stopped only twice\nto replenish with wood, water, and fruit. These commodities, too, the\nsavages brought us freely, so great was their subjection, and in\nneither place did we have even the semblance of a fight. It was a great\ncertificate of the growing power of Atlantis and her finest over-sea\ncolony.\n\nThen boldly on we went across the vast ocean beyond, with never a\nsacrifice to implore the Gods that they should help our direction. One\nmight feel censure towards these rugged mariners for their impiety, but\none could not help an admiration for their lusty skill and confidence.\n\nThe dangers of the desolate sea are dealt out as the Gods will, and man\ncan only take them as they come. Storms we encountered, and the mariners\nfought them with stubborn endurance; twice a blazing stone from Heaven\nhissed into the sea beside us, though without injuring any of our ships;\nand, as was unavoidable, the great beasts of the sea hunted us with\ntheir accustomed savagery. But only once did we suffer material loss\nfrom these last, and that was when three of the greater sea lizards\nattacked the \"Bear,\" the ship whereon I travelled, at one and the same\ntime.\n\nThe hour of their onset was during the blazing midday heat, and the Sun\nbeing at the full of His power, our machines were getting full force\nfrom Him. The vessel was travelling forward faster than a man on dry\nland could walk. But for the power escape she might as well have been\nstanding still when the beasts sighted her. There were three of them,\nas I have said, and we saw them come up over the curve of the horizon,\nbeating the sea into foam with their flappers, and waving their great\nnecks like masts as they swam. Our navy was spread out in a long line\nof ships, and in olden days each of the beasts would have selected a\nseparate prey, and proceeded for it; but, like man, these beasts have\nlearned the necessities of warfare, and they hunt in pack now and do not\nseparate their forces.\n\nIt was plain they were making for our ship, and Tob, the captain, would\nhave had me go into the after-castle, and there be secure from their\nmarauding. He was responsible to the Lord Tatho, he said, for my safe\nconduct; it was certain that the beasts would contrive to seize some of\nthe ship's company before they were satiated; and if the hap came to the\nLord Deucalion, he (the captain) would have to give himself voluntarily\nto the beasts then, to escape a very painful death at Tatho's hands\nlater on.\n\nHowever, my mind was set. A man can never have too much experience in\nfighting enemies, whether human or bestial, and the attack of these\ncreatures was new to me, and I was fain to learn its method. So I gave\nthe captain a letter to Tatho, saying how the matter lay (and for which,\nit may be mentioned, the rude fellow seemed little enough grateful), and\nstayed in my chair under the awning.\n\nThe beasts surged up to us with champing jaws, and all the shipmen\nstood armed on their defence. They came up alongside, two females (the\nsmaller) on the flank of the ship, the giant male by himself on the\nother. Their great heads swooped about, as high as the yards that held\nthe sails, and the reek from them gave one physical sickness.\n\nThe shipmen faced the monsters with a sturdy courage. Arrows were\nuseless against the smooth, bull-like hides. Even the throwing fire\ncould not so much as singe them; nothing but twenty axe blows delivered\non an attacking head together could beat it back, and even these\nsucceeded only through sheer weight of metal, and did not make so much\nas the scratch of a wound.\n\nDuring all time beasts have disputed with man the mastery of the earth,\nand it is only in Atlantis and Egypt and Yucatan that man has dared to\nhold his own, and fight them with a mind made strong by many previous\nvictories. In Europe and mid-Africa the greater beasts hold full\ndominion, and man admits his puny number and force, and lives in earth\ncrannies and the higher tree-tops, as a fugitive confessed. And upon the\ngreat oceans, the beasts are lords, unchecked.\n\nStill here, upon this desolate sea, although the giant lizards were new\nto me, it was a pleasure to pit my knowledge of war against their brute\nstrength and courage. Ever since the first men did their business upon\nthe great waters, they fulfilled their instincts in fighting the beasts\nwith desperation. Hiding coward-like in a hold was useless, for if this\nenemy could not find men above decks to glut them, they would break\na ship with their paddles, and so all would be slain. And so it was\nrecognised that the fight should go forward as desperately as might be,\nand that it could only end when the beasts had got their prey and had\ngone away satisfied.\n\nIt was in a one-sided conflict after this fashion then, that I found\nmyself, and felt the joy once more to have my thews in action. But after\nmy axe had got in some dozen lusty blows, which, for all the harm they\ndid, might have been delivered against some city wall, or, indeed,\nagainst the ark of the Mysteries itself, I sought about me till I found\na lance, and with that made very different play.\n\nThe eyes of these lizards are small, and set deep in a bony socket, but\nI judged them to be vulnerable, and it was upon the eyes of the beast\nthat I made my attack. The decks were slippery with the horrid slime of\nthem. The crew surged about in their battling, and, moreover, constantly\noffered themselves as a rampart before me by reason of Tob, the\ncaptain's threats. But I gave a few shrewd progues with the lance to\nshow that I did not choose my will to be overridden, and presently was\ngiven room for manoeuvre.\n\nDeliberately I placed myself in the sight of one of the lizards, and\noffered my body to its attack. The challenge was accepted. It swooped\nlike a dropping stone, and I swerved and drove in the lance at its oozy\neye.\n\nI thanked the Gods then that I had been trained with the lance till\ncertain aim was a matter of instinct with me. The blade went true to\nits mark and stuck there, and the shaft broke in my hand. The beast drew\noff, blinded and bellowing, and beating the sea with its paddles. In a\ngreat cataract of foam I saw it bend its great long neck, and rub its\nhead (with the spear still fixed) against its back, thereby enduring new\nagonies, but without dislodging the weapon. And then presently, finding\nthis of no avail, it set off for the place from which it came with\nextraordinary quickness, and rapidly grew smaller against the horizon.\n\nThe male and the other female lizard had also left us, but not in\nsimilar plight. Tob, the captain, seeing my resolve to take hazards,\ndeliberately thrust a shipman into the jaws of each of the others,\nso that they might be sated and get them gone. It was clear that Tob\ndreaded very much for his own skin if I came by harm, and I thought with\na warming heart of the threats that Tatho must have used in his kind\nanxiety for my safety. It is pleasant when one's old friends do not omit\nto pay these little attentions.\n\n\n\n\n3. A RIVAL NAVY\n\n\nNow, when we came up with the coasts of Atlantis, though Tob, with\nthe aid of his modern instruments, had made his landfall with most\nmarvellous skill and nearness, there still remained some ten days' more\njourney in which we had to retrace our course, till we came to that arm\nof the sea up which lies the great city of Atlantis, the capital.\n\nThe sight of the land, and the breath of earth and herbage which came\noff from it with the breezes, were, I believe, under the Gods, the\nmeans of saving the lives of all of us. For, as is necessary with long\ncross-ocean voyages, many of our ships' companies had died, and still\nmore were sick with scurvy through the unnatural tossing, or (as some\nhave it) through the salt, unnatural food inseparable from shipboard.\nBut these last, the sight and the smells of land heartened up in\nextraordinary fashion, and from being helpless logs, unable to move even\nunder blows of the scourge, they became active again, able to help in\nthe shipwork, and lusty (when the time came) to fight for their lives\nand their vessels.\n\nFrom the moment that I was deposed in Yucatan, despite Tatho's\nassurances, there had been doubts in my mind as to what nature would\nbe my reception in Atlantis. But I had faced this event of the future\nwithout concern: it was in the hands of the Gods. The Empress Phorenice\nmight be supreme on earth; she might cause my head to be lopped from its\nproper shoulders the moment I set foot ashore; but my Lord the Sun was\nabove Phorenice, and if my head fell, it would be because He saw best\nthat it should be so. On which account, therefore, I had not troubled\nmyself about the matter during the voyage, but had followed out my calm\nstudy of the higher mysteries with an unloaded mind.\n\nBut when our navy had retraced sufficiently the course that had been\noverrun, and came up with the two vast headlands which marked the\nentrance to the inland waters, there, a bare two days from the Atlantis\ncapital, we met with another navy which was, beyond doubt, waiting to\ngive us a reception. The ships were riding at anchor in a bay which lent\nthem shelter, but they had scouts on the high land above, who cried\nthe alarm of our approach, and when we rounded the headland, they were\nstanding out to dispute our passage.\n\nOf us there were now but five ships, the rest having been lost in\nstorms, or fallen behind because all their crews were dead from the\nscurvy; and of the strangers there were three fine ships, and three\ngalleys of many oars apiece. They were clean and bright and black; our\nships were storm-ragged and weather-worn, and had bottoms that were foul\nwith trailing ocean weed. Our ships hung out the colours and signs of\nTatho and Deucalion openly and without shame, so that all who looked\nmight know their origin and errand; but the other navy came on without\nbanner or antient, as though they were some low creatures feeling shame\nfor their birth.\n\nClear it seemed also that they would not let us pass without a fight,\nand in this there was nothing uncommon; for no law carries out over the\nseas, and a brother in one ship feels quite free to harry his brother\nin another vessel if he meets him out of earshot of the beach--more\nespecially if that other brother be coming home laden from foray or\ntrading tour. So Tob, with system and method, got our vessel into\nfighting trim, and the other four captains did the like with theirs,\nand drew close in to us to form a compact squadron. They had no wish to\nsmell slavery, now that the voyage had come so near to its end.\n\nOur Lord the Sun shone brilliantly, giving full speed to the machines,\nas though He was fully willing for the affair to proceed, and the two\nnavies approached one another with quickness, the three galleys holding\nback to stay in line with their consorts. But when some bare hundred\nship-lengths separated us, the other navy halted, and one of the\ngalleys, drawing ahead, flew green branches from her masts, seeking for\na parley.\n\nThe course was unusual, but we, in our sea-battered state, were no navy\nto invite a fight unnecessarily. So in hoarse sea-bawls word was passed,\nand we too halted, and Tob hoisted a withered stick (which had to do\nduty for greenery), to show that we were ready for talk, and would\nrespect the person of an ambassador.\n\nThe galley drew on, swung round, and backed till its stern rasped on our\nshield rail, and one of her people clambered up and jumped down upon\nour decks. He was a dandily rigged-out fellow, young and lusty, and all\nhealthy from the land and land victual, and he looked round him with a\nsneer at our sea-tatteredness, and with a fine self-confidence. Then,\nseeing Tob, he nodded as one meets an acquaintance. \"Old pot-mate,\" he\nsaid, \"your woman waits for you up by the quay-side in Atlantis yonder,\nwith four youngsters at her heels. I saw her not half a month ago.\"\n\n\"You didn't come out here to tell me home news,\" said Tob; \"that I'll be\nsworn. I've drunk enough pots with you, Dason, to know your pleasantries\nthoroughly.\"\n\n\"I wanted to point out to you that your home is still there, with your\nwife and children ready to welcome you.\"\n\n\"I am not a man that ever forgets it,\" said Tob grimly; \"and because\nI've got them always at the back of my mind, I've sailed this ship over\nthe top of more than one pirate, when, if I'd been a single man, I might\nhave been e'en content to take the hap of slavery.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know you're a desperate enough fellow,\" said Dason, \"and I'm free\nto confess that if it does come to blows we are like to lose a few\nmen before we get you and your cripples here, and your crazy ships\ncomfortably sunk. Our navy has its orders to carry out, and the cause of\nmy embassage is this: we wish to see if you will act the sensible part\nand give us what we want, and so be permitted to go on your way home,\nwith a skin that is unslit and dry?\"\n\n\"You have come to the wrong bird here for a plucking,\" said Tob with a\nheavy laugh. \"We took no treasure or merchandise on board in Yucatan. We\nstayed in harbour long enough to cure our sea victual and fill with food\nand water, and no longer. We sail back as we sailed out, barren ships.\nYou will not believe me, of course; I would not have believed you had\nour places been changed; but you may go into the holds and search if\nyou choose. You will find there nothing but a few poor sailormen half in\npieces with the scurvy. No, you can steal nothing here but blows, Dason,\nand we will give you those with but little asking.\"\n\n\"I am glad to see that you state your cargo at such slender value,\" said\nthe envoy, \"for it is the cargo I must take back with me on the galley,\nif you are to earn your safe conduct to home.\"\n\nTob knit his brows. \"You had better speak more plain,\" he said. \"I am a\ncommon sailor, and do not understand fancy talk.\"\n\n\"It is clear to see,\" said Dason, \"that you have been set to bring\nDeucalion back to Atlantis as a prop for Phorenice. Well, we others find\nPhorenice hard enough to fight against without further reinforcements,\nand so we want Deucalion in our own custody to deal with after our own\nfashion.\"\n\n\"And if I do the miser, and deny you this piece of my freight?\"\n\nThe spruce envoy looked round at the splintered ship, and the battered\nnavy beside her. \"Why, then, Tob, we shall send you all to the fishes\nin very short time, and instead of Deucalion standing before the Gods\nalone, he will go down with a fine ragged company limping at his heels.\"\n\n\"I doubt it,\" said Tob, \"but we shall see. As for letting you have my\nLord Deucalion, that is out of the question. For see here, pot-mate\nDason; in the first place, if I went to Atlantis without Deucalion, my\nother lord, Tatho, would come back one of these days, and in his hands I\nshould die by the slowest of slow inches; in the second, I have seen\nmy Lord Deucalion kill a great sea lizard, and he showed himself such a\nproper man that day that I would not give him up against his will, even\nto Tatho himself; and in the third place, you owe me for your share in\nour last wine-bout ashore, and I'll see you with the nether Gods before\nI give you aught till you've settled that score.\"\n\n\"Well, Tob, I hope you'll drown easy. As for that wife of yours, I've\nalways had a fancy for her myself, and I shall know how to find a use\nfor the woman.\"\n\n\"I'll draw your neck for that, you son of a European,\" said Tob; \"and\nif you do not clear off this deck I'll draw it here. Go,\" he cried, \"you\nfather of monkey children! Get away, and let me fight you fairly, or by\nmy honour I'll stamp the inwards out of you, and make your silly crew\nwear them as necklaces.\"\n\nUpon which Dason went to his galley.\n\nPromptly Tob set going the machine on our own \"Bear,\" and bawled his\norders right and left to the other ships. The crew might be weak with\nscurvy, but they were quick to obey. Instantly the five vessels were all\nstarted, and because our Lord the Sun was shining brightly, got soon to\nthe full of their pace. The whole of our small navy converged, singling\nout one ship of their opponents, and she, not being ready for so swift\nan attack, got flurried, and endeavoured to turn and run for room,\ninstead of trying to meet us bows on. As a consequence, the whole of our\nfive ships hit her together on the broadside, tearing her planking with\ntheir underwater beaks, and sinking her before we had backed clear from\nthe engage.\n\nBut if we thus brought the enemy's number down to five, and so equal to\nour own, the advantage did not remain with us for long. The three nimble\ngalleys formed into line: their boatswains' whips cracked as the slaves\nbent to their oars, and presently one of our own ships was gored and\nsunk, the men on her being killed in the water without hope of rescue.\n\nAnd then commenced a tight-locked melee that would have warmed the heart\nof the greatest warrior alive. The ships and the galleys were forced\ntogether and lay savagely grinding one another upon the swells, as\nthough they had been sentient animals. The men on board them shot their\narrows, slashed with axes, thrust and hacked with swords, and hurled the\nthrowing fire. But in every way the fight converged upon the \"Bear.\" It\nwas on her that the enemy spent the fiercest of their spite; it was to\nthe \"Bear,\" that the other crews of Tatho's navy rallied as their own\nvessels caught fire, or were sunk or taken.\n\nBattle is an old acquaintance with us of the Priestly Clan, and for\nthose of us who have had to carve out territories for the new colonies,\nit comes with enough frequency to cloy even the most chivalrous\nappetite. So I can speak here as a man of experience. Up till that time,\nfor half a life-span, I had heard men shout \"Deucalion\" as a battlecry,\nand in my day had seen some lusty encounters. But this sea-fight\nsurprised even me in its savage fierceness. The bleak, unstable element\nwhich surrounded us; the swaying decks on which we fought; the throwing\nfire, which burnt flesh and wood alike with its horrid flame; the\ngreat gluttonous man-eating birds that hovered in the sky overhead;\nthe man-eating fish that swarmed up from the seas around, gnawing and\nquarrelling over those that fell into the waters, all went to make up a\ncircumstance fit to daunt the bravest men-at-arms ever gathered for an\narmy.\n\nBut these tarry shipmen faced it all with an indomitable courage, and\nnever a cry of quailing. Life on the seas is so hard, and (from the\nbeasts that haunt the great waters) so full of savage dangers, that\nDeath has lost half his terrors to them through sheer familiarity.\nThey were fellows who from pure lust for a fray would fight to a finish\namongst themselves in the taverns ashore; and so here, in this desperate\nsea-battle, the passion for killing burned in them, as a fire stone\nfrom Heaven rages in a forest; and they took even their death-wounds\nlaughing.\n\nOn our side the battle-cry was \"Tob!\" and the name of this obscure\nship-captain seemed to carry a confidence with it for our own crews that\nmany a well-known commander might have envied. The enemy had a\ndozen rallying cries, and these confused them. But as their other\nship-commanders one by one were killed, and Dason remained, active\nwith mischief, \"Dason!\" became the shout which was thrown back at us in\nresponse to our \"Tob!\"\n\nHowever, I will not load my page with farther long account of this\nobscure sea-fight, whose only glory was its ferocity. One by one all the\nships of either side were sunk or lay with all their people killed, till\nfinally only Dason's galley and our own \"Bear\" were left. For the moment\nwe were being mastered. We had a score of men remaining out of all those\nthat manned the navy when it sailed from Yucatan, and the enemy had\nboarded us and made the decks of the \"Bear\" the field of battle. But\nthey had been over busy with the throwing fire, and presently, as we\nraged at one another, the smoke and the flame from the sturdy vessel\nherself let us very plainly know that she was past salvation.\n\nBut Tob was nothing daunted. \"They may stay here and fry if they\nchoose,\" he shouted with his great boisterous laugh, \"but for ourselves\nthe galley is good enough now. Keep a guard on Deucalion, and come with\nme, shipmates!\"\n\n\"Tob!\" our fellows shouted in their ecstasy of fighting madness, and I\ntoo could not forbear sending out a \"Tob!\" for my battle-cry. It was a\nchange for me not to be leader, but it was a luxury for once to fight\nin the wake of this Tob, despite his uncouthness of mien and plan. There\nwas no stopping this new rush, though progress still was slow. Tob with\nhis bloody axe cut the road in front, and we others, with the lust of\nbattle filling us to the chin, raged like furies in his wake. Gods! but\nit was a fight.\n\nTen of us won to the galley, with the flames and the smoke from the poor\n\"Bear\" spurting at our heels. We turned and stabbed madly at all who\ntried to follow, and hacked through the grapples that held the vessels\nto their embrace. The sea-swells spurned the \"Bear\" away.\n\nThe slaves chained to the rowing-galley's benches had interest neither\none way nor the other, and looked on the contest with dull concern, save\nwhen some stray missile found a billet amongst them. But a handful of\nthe fighting men had scrambled desperately on board the galley after us,\npreferring any fate to a fiery death on the \"Bear,\" and these had to be\ndealt with promptly. Three, with their fighting fury still red-hot in\nthem, had most wastefully to be killed out of mischief's way; five, who\nhad pitched their weapons into the sea, were chained to oar looms, in\nplace of slaves who were dead; and there remained only Dason to have a\nfate apportioned.\n\nThe fight had cooled out of him, and he had thrown his arms to the sea,\nand stood sullenly ready for what might befall; and to him Tob went up\nwith an exulting face.\n\n\"Ho, pot-mate Dason,\" cried he, \"you made a lot of talk an hour ago\nabout that woman of mine, who lives with her brats on the quay-side in\nAtlantis yonder. Now, I'll give you a pleasant choice; either I'll\ntake you along home, and tell her what you said before the whole ship's\ncompany (that are for the most part dead now, poor souls!), and I'll\nleave her to perform on your carcase as she sees fit by way of payment;\nor, as the other choice, I'll deal with you here now myself.\"\n\n\"I thank you for the chance,\" said Dason, and knelt and offered his neck\nto the axe. So Tob cut off his head, sticking it on the galley's beak as\nan advertisement of what had been done. The body he threw over the side,\nand one of the great man-eating birds that hovered near, picked it up\nand flew away with it to its nest amongst the crags. And so we were\nfree to get a meal of the fruits and the fresh meats which the galley\noffered, whilst the oar-slaves sent the galley rushing onwards towards\nthe capital.\n\nThere was a wine-skin in the after-castle, and I filled a horn and\npoured some out at Tob's feet in salutation. \"My man,\" I said, \"you have\nshown me a fight.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said he, \"and I know you are a judge. 'Twas pretty whilst it\nlasted; and, seeing that my lads were, for the most, scurvy-rotten, I\nwill say they fought with credit. I have lost my Lord Tatho's navy, but\nI think Phorenice will see me righted there. If those that are against\nher took so much trouble to kill my Lord Deucalion before he could come\nto her aid, I can fancy she will not be niggard in her joy when I put\nDeucalion safe, if somewhat dented and blood-bespattered, on the quay.\"\n\n\"The Gods know,\" I said, for it is never my custom to discuss policies\nwith my inferiors, even though etiquette be for the moment loosened,\nas ours was then by the thrill of battle. \"The Gods will decide what\nis best for you, Tob, even as they have decided that it is best that I\nshould go on to Atlantis.\"\n\nThe sailor held a horn filled from the wine-skin in his hand, and I\nthink was minded to pour a libation at my feet, even as I had done at\nhis. But he changed his mind, and emptied it down his throat instead.\n\"It is thirsty work, this fighting,\" he said, \"and that drink comes very\nuseful.\"\n\nI put my hand on his blood-smeared arm. \"Tob,\" I said, \"whether I step\ninto power again, or whether I go to the block to-morrow, is another\nmatter which the Gods alone know, but hear me tell you now, that if a\nchance is given me of showing my gratitude, I shall not forget the way\nyou have served me in this voyage, and the way you have fought this\nday.\"\n\nTob filled another brimming horn from the wine-skin and splashed it at\nmy feet. \"That's good enough surety for me,\" he said, \"that my woman and\nbrats never want from this day onward. The Lord Deucalion for the block,\nindeed!\"\n\n\n\n\n4. THE WELCOME OF PHORENICE\n\n\nNow I can say it with all truth that, till the rival navy met us in the\nmouth of the gulf, I had thought little enough of my importance as a\nrecruit for the Empress. But the laying in wait for us of those ships,\nand the wild ferocity with which they fought so that I might fall into\ntheir hands, were omens which the blindest could not fail to read. It\nwas clear that I was expected to play a lusty part in the fortunes of\nthe nation.\n\nBut if our coming had been watched for by enemies it seemed that\nPhorenice also had her scouts; and these saw us from the mountains, and\ncarried news to the capital. The arm of the sea at the head of which the\nvast city of Atlantis stands, varies greatly in width. In places where\nthe mountains have over-boiled, and sent their liquid contents down to\nform hard stone below, the channel has barely a river's wideness, and\nthen beyond, for the next half-day's sail it will widen out into a lake,\nwith the sides barely visible. Moreover, its course is winding, and so\na runner who knows his way across the flats, and the swamps, and between\nthe smoking hills which lie along the shore, and did not get overcome by\nfire-streams, or water, or wandering beasts, could carry news overland\nfrom seacoast to capital far speedier than even the most shrewdly\nwhipped of galleys could ferry it along the water.\n\nOf course there were heavy risks that a lone traveller would not make\na safe passage by this land route, if he were bidden to sacrifice all\nprecautions to speed. But Phorenice was no niggard with her couriers.\nShe sent a corps of twenty to the headland that overlooks the\nsea-entrance to the straits; they started with the news, each on his own\nroute; and it says much for their speed and cleverness, that no fewer\nthan seven of these agile fellows came through scathless with their\ntidings, and of the others it was said that quite three were known to\nhave survived.\n\nStill, about this we had no means of knowing at the time, and pushed\non in fancy that our coming was quite unheralded. The slaves on the\ngalley's row-banks were for the most part savages from Europe, and the\nsmell of them was so offensive that the voyage lost all its pleasures;\nand as, moreover, the wind carried with it an infinite abundance of\nsmall grit from some erupting fire mountain, we were anxious to linger\nas little as possible. Besides, if I may confess to such a thing without\nbeing unduly degraded, although by my priestly training I had been\ntaught stoicism, and knew that all the future was in the hands of the\nGods, I was frailly human still to have a very vast curiosity as to\nwhat would be the form of my own reception at Atlantis. I could imagine\nmyself taken a formal prisoner on landing, and set on a formal trial\nto answer for my cure of the colony of Yucatan; I could imagine myself\nstepping ashore unknown and unnoticed, and after a due lapse, being\nsent for by the Empress to take up new duties; but the manner of my real\nwelcome was a thing I did not even guess at.\n\nWe came in sight of the peak of the sacred mountain, with its glare of\neternal fires which stand behind the city, one morning with the day's\nbreak, and the whips of the boatswains cracked more vehemently, so that\nthose offensive slaves should give the galley a final spurt. The wind\nwas adverse, and no sail could be spread, but under oars alone we made\na pretty pace, and the sides of the sacred mountain grew longer, and\npresently the peaks of the pyramids in the city, the towers of the\nhigher buildings, began to show themselves as though they floated upon\nthe gleaming water. It was twenty years since I had seen Atlantis\nlast, and my heart glowed with the thought of treading again upon her\npaving-stones.\n\nThe splendid city grew out of the sea as we approached, and to every\nthrob of the oars, the shores leaped nearer. I saw the temple where I\nhad been admitted first to manhood; I saw the pyramid in whose heart\nI had been initiated to the small mysteries; and then (as the lesser\nobjects became discernible) I made out the house where a father and a\nmother had reared me, and my eyes became dim as the memories rose.\n\nWe drew up outside the white walls of the harbour, as the law was, and\nthe slaves panted and sobbed in quietude over the oar-looms. For vessels\nthus stationed there is, generally, a sufficiency of waiting, for a\nport-captain is apt to be so uncertain of his own dignity, that he must\ne'en keep folks waiting to prove it to them. But here for us it might\nhave been that the port-captain's boat was waiting. The signal was\nsounded from the two castles at the harbour's entrance, the chain which\nhung between them was dropped, and a ten-oared boat shot out from behind\nthe walls as fast as oars could drive her. She raced up alongside and\nthe questions were put:\n\n\"That should be Dason's galley?\"\n\n\"It was,\" said Tob.\n\n\"Oh, I saw Dason's head on your beak,\" said the port-captain. \"You were\nTatho's captain?\"\n\n\"And am still. Tatho's fleet was sent by Dason and his friends to the\nsea-floor, and so we took this stinking galley to finish the voyage in,\nseeing that it was the only craft left afloat.\"\n\nThe port-captain was roving his eye over the group of us who stood on\nthe after-deck. \"I fear me, captain, that you'll have but a dangerous\nreception. I do not see my Lord Deucalion. Or does he come with some\nother navy? Gods, captain, if you have let him get killed whilst under\nyour charge, the Empress will have the skin torn slowly off you living.\"\n\n\"What with Phorenice and Tatho both so curious for his welfare,\" said\nTob, \"my Lord Deucalion seems but a dangerous passenger. But I shall\nsave my hide this voyage.\" He jerked at me with his thumb. \"He's there\nto put in a word for me himself.\"\n\nThe port-captain stared for a moment, as if unbelieving, and then, as\nthough satisfied, made obeisance like a fellow well used to ceremonial.\n\"I trust my lord, in his infinite strength, will pardon my sin in not\nknowing him by his nobleness before. But truth to tell, I had looked to\nsee my lord more suitably apparelled.\"\n\n\"Pish,\" I said; \"if I choose to dress simply, I cannot object to being\nmistaken for a simple man. It is not my pleasure to advertise my quality\nby the gauds on my garb. If you think amends are due to me, I pray of\nyour charity that this inquisition may end.\"\n\nThe fellow was all bows and obsequiousness. \"I am the humblest of my\nlord's servants,\" he said. \"It will be my exceeding honour to pilot my\nlord's galley into the berth appointed in harbour.\"\n\nThe boat shot ahead, and our galley-slaves swung into stroke again. Tob\nwatched me with a dry smile as he stood directing the men at the helms.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, humouring his whim, \"what is it?\"\n\n\"I'm thinking,\" said Tob, \"that my Lord Deucalion will remember me\nonly as a very rude fellow when he steps ashore amongst all this fine\ngentility.\"\n\n\"You don't think,\" said I, \"anything of the kind.\"\n\n\"Then I must prove my refinement,\" said Tob, \"and not contradict.\" He\npicked up my hand in his huge, hard fist, and pressed it. \"By the Gods,\nDeucalion, you may be a great prince, but I've only known you as a\nman. You're the finest fighter of beasts and men that walks this world\nto-day, and I love you for it. That spear-stroke of yours on the lizard\nis a thing the singers in the taverns shall make chaunts about.\"\n\nWe drew rapidly into the harbour, the soldiers in the entrance castle\nblowing their trumpets in welcome as we passed between them. The captain\nof the port had run up my banner to the masthead of his boat, having\nbeen provided with one apparently for this purpose of announcement, and\nfrom the quays, across the vast basin of the harbour, there presently\ncame to us the noises of musicians, and the pale glow of welcoming\nfires, dancing under the sunlight. I was almost awed to think that an\nEmpress of Atlantis had come to such straits as to feel an interest like\nthis in any mere returning subject.\n\nIt was clear that nothing was to be done by halves. The port-captain's\nboat led, and we had no choice but to follow. Our galley was run up\nalongside the royal quay and moored to its posts and rings of gold, all\nof which are sacred to the reigning house.\n\n\"If Dason could only have foreseen this honour,\" said Tob, with grisly\njest, \"I'm sure he'd have laid in a silken warp to make fast on the\nbollards instead of mere plebeian hemp. I'm sure there'd be a frown on\nDason's head this minute, if the sun hadn't scorched it stiff. My Lord\nDeucalion, will you pick your way with niceness over this common ship\nand tread on the genteel carpet they've spread for you on the quay\nyonder?\"\n\nThe port-captain heard Tob's rude banter and looked up with a face of\nhorror, and I remembered, with a small sigh, that colonial freedom would\nhave no place here in Atlantis. Once more I must prepare myself for all\nthe dignity of rank, and make ready to tread the formalities of vast and\ngorgeous ceremonial.\n\nBut, be these things how they may, a self-respecting man must preserve\nhis individuality also, and though I consented to enter a pavilion of\ncrimson cloth, specially erected to shelter me till the Empress should\ndeign to arrive, there my complaisance ended. Again the matter of\nclothes was harped upon. The three gorgeously caparisoned chamberlains,\nwho had inducted me to the shelter, laid before me changes of raiment\nbedecked with every imaginable kind of frippery, and would have me\ntransform myself into a popinjay in fashion like their own.\n\nCurtly enough, I refused to alter my garb, and when one of them\nstammeringly referred to the Empress's tastes I asked him with plainness\nif he had got any definite commands on this paltry matter from her\nmightiness.\n\nOf course, he had to confess that there were none.\n\nUpon which I retorted that Phorenice had commanded Deucalion, the man,\nto attend before her, and had sent no word of her pleasure as to his\nouter casing.\n\n\"This dress,\" I said, \"suits my temper well. It shields my poor body\nfrom the heat and the wind, and, moreover, it is clean. It seems to\nme, sirs,\" I added, \"that your interfering savours somewhat of an\nimpertinence.\"\n\nWith one accord the chamberlains drew their swords and pushed the hilts\ntowards me.\n\n\"It would be a favour,\" said their spokesman, \"if the great Lord\nDeucalion would take his vengeance now, instead of delivering us to the\ntormentors hereafter.\"\n\n\"Poof,\" I said, \"the matter is forgotten. You make too much of a\nlittle.\"\n\nNevertheless, their action gave me some enlightenment. They were\nperfectly in earnest in offering me the swords, and I recognised that\nthis was a different Atlantis that I had come home to, where a man had\ndread of the torture for a mere difference concerning the cut of a coat.\n\nThere was a bath in the pavilion, and in that I regaled myself gladly,\nthough there was some paltry scent added to the water that took away\nhalf its refreshing power; and then I set myself to wait with all\noutward composure and placidity. The chamberlains were too well-bred to\nbreak into my calm, and I did not condescend to small talk. So there we\nremained, the four of us, I sitting, they standing, with our Lord the\nSun smiting heavily on the scarlet roof of the pavilion, whilst the\nmusic blared, and the welcoming fires dispersed their odours from the\ngreat paved square without, which faced upon the quay.\n\nIt has been said that the great should always collect dignity by keeping\nthose of lesser degree waiting their pleasure, though for myself I must\nsay I have always thought the stratagem paltry and beneath me. Phorenice\nalso seemed of this opinion, for (as she herself told me later) at the\nmoment that Tob's galley was reported as having its flank against the\nmarble of the royal quay, at that precise moment did she start out from\nthe palace. The gorgeous procession was already marshalled, bedecked,\nand waiting only for its chiefest ornament, and as soon as she had\nmounted to her steed, trumpets gave the order, and the advance began.\n\nSitting in the doorway of the pavilion, I saw the soldiery who formed\nthe head of this vast concourse emerge from the great broad street where\nit left the houses. They marched straight across to give me the salute,\nand then ranged themselves on the farther side of the square. Then came\nthe Mariners' Guild, then more soldiers, all making obeisance in\ntheir turn, and passing on to make room for others. Following were the\nmerchants, the tanners, the spear-makers and all the other acknowledged\nGuilds, deliberately attired (so it seemed to me) that they might make\na pageant; and whilst most walked on foot, there were some who proudly\nrode on beasts which they had tamed into rendering them this menial\nservice.\n\nBut presently came the two wonders of all that dazzling spectacle. From\nout of the eclipse of the houses there swung into the open no less a\nbeast than a huge bull mammoth. The sight had sufficient surprise in it\nalmost to make me start. Many a time during my life had I led hunts\nto kill the mammoth, when a herd of them had raided some village or\ncornland under my charge. I had seen the huge brutes in the wild ground,\nshaggy, horrid, monstrous; more fierce than even the cave-tiger or the\ncave-bear; most dangerous beast of all that fight with man for dominion\nof the earth, save only for a few of the greater lizards. And here\nwas this creature, a giant even amongst mammoths, yet tame as any\nwell-whipped slave, and bearing upon its back a great half-castle of\ngold, stamped with the outstretched hand, and bedecked with silver\nsnakes. Its murderous tusks were gilded, its hairy neck was garlanded\nwith flowers, and it trod on in the procession as though assisting at\nsuch pageantry was the beginning and end of its existence. Its tameness\nseemed a fitting symbol of the masterful strength of this new ruler of\nAtlantis.\n\nSimultaneously with the mammoth, there came into sight that other and\ngreater wonder, the mammoth's mistress, the Empress Phorenice. The beast\ntook my eye at the first, from its very uncouth hugeness, from its\nshow of savage power restrained; but the lady who sat in the golden\nhalf-castle on its lofty back quickly drew away my gaze, and held it\nimmovable from then onwards with an infinite attraction.\n\nI stood to my feet when the people first shouted at Phorenice's\napproach, and remained in the porchway of my scarlet pavilion till her\nvast steed had halted in the centre of the square, and then I advanced\nacross the pavement towards her.\n\n\"On your knees, my lord,\" said one of the chamberlains behind me, in a\nscared whisper.\n\n\"At least with bent head,\" urged another.\n\nBut I had my own notions of what is due to one's own self-respect in\nthese matters, and I marched across the bare open space with head erect,\ngiving the Empress gaze for gaze. She was clearly summing me up. I was\nfrankly doing the like by her. Gods! but those few short seconds made me\nsee a woman such as I never imagined could have lived.\n\nI know I have placed it on record earlier in this writing that, during\nall the days of a long official life, women have had no influence over\nme. But I have been quick to see that they often had a strong swaying\npower over the policies of others, and as a consequence I have made it\nmy business to study them even as I have studied men. But this woman who\nsat under the sacred snakes in her golden half-castle on the mammoth's\nback, fairly baffled me. Of her thoughts I could read no single\nsyllable. I could see a body slight, supple, and beautifully moulded; in\nfigure rather small. Her face was a most perfect book of cleverness, yet\nshe was fair, too, beyond belief, with hair of a lovely ruddiness, cut\nshort in the new fashion, and bunching on her shoulders. And eyes! Gods!\nwho could plumb the depths of Phorenice's eyes, or find in mere tint a\ntrace of their heaven-made colour?\n\nIt was plain, also, that she in her turn was searching me down to\nmy very soul, and it seemed that her scrutiny was not without its\nsatisfaction. She moved her head in little nods as I drew near, and when\nI did the requisite obeisance permitted to my rank, she bade me in\na voice loud and clear enough for all at hand to hear, never to put\nforehead on the ground again on her behalf so long as she ruled in\nAtlantis.\n\n\"For others,\" she said, \"it is fitting that they should do so, once,\ntwice, or several times, according to their rank and station, for I am\nEmpress, and they are all so far beneath me; but you are Deucalion, my\nlord, and though till to-day I knew you only from pictures drawn with\ntongues, I have seen you now, and have judged for myself. And so I make\nthis decree: Deucalion is above all other men in Atlantis, and if there\nis one who does not render him obedience, that man is enemy also of\nPhorenice, and shall feel her anger.\"\n\nShe made a sign, and a stair was brought, and then she called to me, and\nI mounted and sat beside her in the golden half-castle under the canopy\nof royal snakes. The girl who stood behind in attendance fanned us both\nwith perfumed feathers, and at a word from Phorenice the mammoth was\nturned, bearing us back towards the royal pyramid by the way through\nwhich it had come. At the same time also all the other machinery of\nsplendour was put in motion. The soldiers and the gaudily bedecked civil\ntraders fell into procession before and behind, and I noted that a body\nof troops, heavily armed, marched on each of the mammoth's flanks.\n\nPhorenice turned to me with a smile. \"You piqued me,\" she said, \"at\nfirst.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty overwhelms me with so much notice.\"\n\n\"You looked at my steed before you looked at me. A woman finds it hard\nto forgive a slight like that.\"\n\n\"I envied you the greatest of your conquests, and do still. I have\nfought mammoths myself, and at times have killed, but I never dared even\nto think of taking one alive and bringing it into tameness.\"\n\n\"You speak boldly,\" she said, still smiling, \"and yet you can turn a\npretty compliment. Faugh! Deucalion, the way these people fawn on me\ngives me a nausea. I am not of the same clay as they are, I know; but\njust because I am the daughter of Gods they must needs feed me on the\npap of insincerity.\"\n\nSo Tatho was right, and the swineherd was forgotten. Well, if she chose\nto keep up the fiction she had made, it was not my part to contradict\nher. Rightly or wrongly I was her servant.\n\n\"I have been pining this long enough for a stronger meat than they can\ngive,\" she went on, \"and at last I have sent for you. I have been at\nsome pains to procure my tongue-pictures of you, Deucalion, and though\nyou do not know me yet, I may say I knew you with all thoroughness even\nbefore we met. I can admire a man with a mind great enough to forego the\nsilly gauds of clothes, or the excesses of feasts, or the pamperings of\nwomen.\" She looked down at her own silks and her glittering jewels. \"We\nwomen like to carry colours upon our persons, but that is a different\nmatter. And so I sent for you here to be my minister, and bear with me\nthe burden of ruling.\"\n\n\"There should be better men in broad Atlantis.\"\n\n\"There are not, my lord, and I who know them all by heart tell you so.\nThey are all enamoured of my poor person; they weary me with their empty\nphrases and their importunities; and, though they are always brimming\nwith their cries of service, their own advancement and the filling of\ntheir own treasuries ever comes first with them. So I have sent for you,\nDeucalion, the one strong man in all the world. You at least will not\nsigh to be my lover?\"\n\nI saw her watching for my answer from the corner of her eyes. \"The\nEmpress,\" I said, \"is my mistress, and I will be an honest minister to\nher. With Phorenice, the woman, it is likely that I shall have little\nenough to do. Besides, I am not the sort that sports with this toy they\ncall love.\"\n\n\"And yet you are a personable man enough,\" she said rather thoughtfully.\n\"But that still further proves your strength, Deucalion. You at least\nwill not lose your head through weak infatuation for my poor looks and\ngraces.\"--She turned to the girl who stood behind us.--\"Ylga, fan not so\nviolently.\"\n\nOur talk broke off then for the moment, and I had time to look about\nme. We were passing through the chief street in the fairest, the most\nwonderful city this world has ever seen. I had left it a score of years\nbefore, and was curious to note its increase.\n\nIn public buildings the city had certainly made growth; there were\nnew temples, new pyramids, new palaces, and statuary everywhere. Its\ngreatness and magnificence impressed me more strongly even than usual,\nreturning to it as I did from such a distance of time and space, for,\nthough the many cities of Yucatan might each of them be princely, this\ngreat capital was a place not to be compared with any of them. It was\nimperial and gorgeous beyond descriptive words.\n\nYet most of all was I struck by the poverty and squalor which stood in\nsuch close touch with all this magnificence. In the throngs that lined\nthe streets there were gaunt bodies and hungry faces everywhere. Here\nand there stood one, a man or a woman, as naked as a savage in Europe,\nand yet dull to shame. Even the trader, with trumpery gauds on his coat,\naping the prevailing fashion for display, had a scared, uneasy look to\nhis face, as though he had forgotten the mere name of safety, and hid a\nfrantic heart with his tawdry outward vauntings of prosperity.\n\nPhorenice read the direction of my looks.\n\n\"The season,\" she said, \"has been unhealthy of recent months. These\nlower people will not build fine houses to adorn my city, and because\nthey choose to live on in their squalid, unsightly kennels, there have\nbeen calentures and other sicknesses amongst them, which make them\ndisinclined for work. And then, too, for the moment, earning is not\neasy. Indeed, you may say trade is nearly stopped this last half-year,\nsince the rebels have been hammering so lustily at my city gates.\"\n\nI was fairly startled out of my decorum.\n\n\"Rebels!\" I cried. \"Who are hammering at the gates of Atlantis? Is the\ncity in a state of siege?\"\n\n\"Of their condescension,\" said Phorenice lightly, \"they are giving us\nholiday to-day, and so, happily, my welcome to you comes undisturbed.\nIf they were fighting, your ears would have told you of it. To give them\ntheir due, they are noisy enough in all their efforts. My spies say they\nare making ready new engines for use against the walls, which you may\nsally out to-morrow and break if it gives you amusement. But for to-day,\nDeucalion, I have you, and you have me, and there is peace round us, and\nsome prettiness of display. If you ask for more I will give it you.\"\n\n\"I did not know of this rebellion,\" I said, \"but as Your Majesty has\nmade me your minister, it is well that I should know all about its scope\nat once. This is a matter we should be serious upon.\"\n\n\"And do you think I cannot take it seriously also?\" she retorted.\n\"Ylga,\" she said to the girl that stood behind, \"set loose my dress at\nthe shoulder.\"\n\nAnd when the attendant had unlinked the jewelled clasp (as it seemed to\nme with a very ill grace), she herself stripped down the fabric, baring\nthe pure skin beneath, and showing me just below the curve of the left\nbreast a bandage of bloodstained linen.\n\n\"There is a guarantee of my seriousness yesterday, at any rate,\" she\nsaid, looking at me sidelong. \"The arrow struck on a rib and that saved\nme. If it had struck between, Deucalion would have been standing beside\nmy funeral pyre to-day instead of riding on this pretty steed of mine\nwhich he admires so much. Your eye seems to feast itself most on the\nmammoth, Deucalion. Ah, poor me. I am not one of your shaggy creatures,\nand so it seems I shall never be able to catch your regard. Ylga,\" she\nsaid to the girl behind, \"you may link my dress up again with its clasp.\nMy Lord Deucalion has seen wounds before, and there is nothing else here\nto interest him.\"\n\n\n\n\n5. ZAEMON'S CURSE\n\n\nIt appeared that for the present at any rate I was to have my residence\nin the royal pyramid. The glittering cavalcade drew up in the great\npaved square which lies before the building, and massed itself in\ngroups. The mammoth was halted before the doorway, and when a stair had\nbeen brought, the trumpets sounded, and we three who had ridden in the\ngolden half-castle under the canopy of snakes, descended to the ground.\n\nIt was plain that we were going from beneath the open sky to the\napartments which lay inside the vast stone mazes of the pyramid, and\nwithout thinking, the instinct of custom and reverence that had become\npart of my nature caused me to turn to where the towering rocks of the\nSacred Mountain frowned above the city, and make the usual obeisance,\nand offer up in silence the prescribed prayer. I say I did this thing\nunthinking, and as a matter of common custom, but when I rose to my\nfeet, I could have sworn I heard a titter of laughter from somewhere in\nthat fancifully bedecked crowd of onlookers.\n\nI glanced in the direction of the scoffers, frowningly enough, and\nthen I turned to Phorenice to demand their prompt punishment for the\ndisrespect. But here was a strange thing. I had looked to see her in the\nact and article of rising from an obeisance; but there she was, standing\nerect, and had clearly never touched her forehead to the ground.\nMoreover, she was regarding me with a queer look which I could not\nfathom.\n\nBut whatever was in her mind, she had no plan to bawl about it then\nbefore the people collected in the square. She said to me, \"Come,\"\nand, turning to the doorway, cried for entrance, giving the secret word\nappointed for the day. The ponderous stone blocks, which barred the\nporch, swung back on their hinges, and with stately tread she passed\nout of the hot sunshine into the cool gloom beyond, with the fan-girl\nfollowing decorously at her heels. With a heaviness beginning to grow\nat my heart, I too went inside the pyramid, and the stone doors, with a\nsullen thud, closed behind us.\n\nWe did not go far just then. Phorenice halted in the hall of waiting.\nHow well I remembered the place, with the pictures of kings on its red\nwalls, and the burning fountain of earth-breath which blazed from a jet\nof bronze in the middle of the flooring and gave it light. The old King\nthat was gone had come this far of his complaisance when he bade\nme farewell as I set out twenty years before for my vice-royalty in\nYucatan. But the air of the hall was different to what it had been in\nthose old days. Then it was pure and sweet. Now it was heavy with some\nscent, and I found it languid and oppressive.\n\n\"My minister,\" said the Empress, \"I acquit you of intentional insult;\nbut I think the colonial air has made you a very simple man. Such an\nobeisance as you showed to that mountain not a minute since has not been\nmade since I was sent to reign over this kingdom.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" I said, \"I am a member of the Priests' Clan and was\nbrought up in their tenets. I have been taught, before entering a house,\nto thank the Gods, and more especially our Lord the Sun, for the good\nair that He and They have provided. It has been my fate more than once\nto be chased by streams of fire and stinking air amongst the mountains\nduring one of their sudden boils, and so I can say the prescribed prayer\nupon this matter straight from my heart.\"\n\n\"Circumstances have changed since you left Atlantis,\" said Phorenice,\n\"and when thanks are given now, they are not thrown at those old Gods.\"\n\nI saw her meaning, and almost started at the impiety of it. If this was\nto be the new rule of things, I would have no hand in it. Fate might\ndeal with me as it chose. To serve truly a reigning monarch, that I was\nprepared for; but to palter with sacrilege, and accept a swineherd's\ndaughter as a God, who should receive prayers and obeisances, revolted\nmy manhood. So I invited a crisis.\n\n\"Phorenice,\" I said, \"I have been a priest from my childhood up,\nrevering the Gods, and growing intimate with their mysteries. Till I\nfind for myself that those old things are false, I must stand by that\nallegiance, and if there is a cost for this faithfulness I must pay it.\"\n\nShe looked at me with a slow smile. \"You are a strong man, Deucalion,\"\nshe said.\n\nI bowed.\n\n\"I have heard others as stubborn,\" she said, \"but they were converted.\"\nShe shook out the ruddy bunches of her hair, and stood so that the light\nof the burning earth-breath might fall on the loveliness of her face and\nform. \"I have found it as easy to convert the stubborn as to burn them.\nIndeed, there has been little talk of burning. They have all rushed to\nconversion, whether I would or no. But it seems that my poor looks and\ntongue are wanting in charm to-day.\"\n\n\"Phorenice is Empress,\" I said stolidly, \"and I am her servant.\nTo-morrow, if she gives me leave, I will clear away this rabble which\nclamours outside the walls. I must begin to prove my uses.\"\n\n\"I am told you are a pretty fighter,\" said she. \"Well, I hold some small\nskill in arms myself, and have a conceit that I am something of a judge.\nTo-morrow we will take a taste of battle together. But to-day I\nmust carry through the honourable reception I have planned for you,\nDeucalion. The feast will be set ready soon, and you will wish to make\nready for the feast. There are chambers here selected for your use, and\nstored with what is needful. Ylga will show you their places.\"\n\nWe waited, the fan-girl and I, till Phorenice had passed out of the glow\nof the light-jet, and had left the hall of waiting through a doorway\namongst the shadows of its farther angle, and then (the girl taking a\nlamp and leading) we also threaded our way through the narrow mazes of\nthe pyramid.\n\nEverywhere the air was full of perfumes, and everywhere the passages\nturned and twisted and doubled through the solid stone of the pyramid,\nso that strangers might have spent hours--yes, or days--in search before\nthey came to the chamber they desired. There was a fine cunningness\nabout those forgotten builders who set up this royal pyramid. They had\nno mind that kings should fall by the hand of vulgar assassins who might\ncome in suddenly from outside. And it is said also that the king of the\ntime, to make doubly sure, killed all that had built the pyramid, or\nseen even the lay of its inner stones.\n\nBut the fan-girl led the way with the lamp swinging in her hand, as one\naccustomed to the mazes. Here she doubled, there she turned, and here\nshe stopped in the middle of a blank wall to push a stone, which swung\nto let us pass. And once she pressed at the corner of a flagstone on the\nfloor, which reared up to the thrust of her foot, and showed us a stair\nsteep and narrow. That we descended, coming to the foot of an inclined\nway which led us upward again; and so by degrees we came unto the\nchamber which had been given for my use.\n\n\"There is raiment in all these chests which stand by the walls,\"\nsaid the girl, \"and jewels and gauds in that bronze coffer. They are\nPhorenice's first presents, she bid me say, and but a small earnest of\nwhat is to come. My Lord Deucalion can drop his simplicity now, and fig\nhimself out in finery to suit the fashion.\"\n\n\"Girl,\" I said sharply, \"be more decorous with your tongue, and spare me\nsuch small advice.\"\n\n\"If my Lord Deucalion thinks this a rudeness, he can give a word to\nPhorenice, and I shall be whipped. If he asks it, I can be stripped and\nscourged before him. The Empress will do much for Deucalion just now.\"\n\n\"Girl,\" I said, \"you are nearer to that whipping than you think for.\"\n\n\"I have got a name,\" she retorted, looking at me sullenly from under her\nblack brows. \"They call me Ylga. You might have heard that as we rode\nhere on the mammoth, had you not been so wrapped up in Phorenice.\"\n\nI gazed at her curiously. \"You have never seen me before,\" I said, \"and\nthe first words you utter are those that might well bring trouble to\nyourself. There is some object in all this.\"\n\nShe went and pushed to the massive stone that swung in the doorway of\nthe chamber. Then she put her little jewelled fingers on my garment and\ndrew me carefully away from the airshaft into the farther corner. \"I am\nthe daughter of Zaemon,\" she said, \"whom you knew.\"\n\n\"You bring me some message from him?\"\n\n\"How could I? He lives in the priests' dwellings on the Mountain you did\nobeisance to. I have not put eyes on him these two years. But when I\nsaw you first step out from that red pavilion they had pitched at the\nharbour side, I--I felt a pity for you, Deucalion. I remembered you were\nmy father's, Zaemon's, friend, and I knew what Phorenice had in store.\nShe has been plotting it all these two months.\"\n\n\"I cannot hear words against the Empress.\"\n\n\"And yet--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nShe stamped her sandal upon the stone of the floor. \"You must be a very\nblind man, Deucalion, or a very daring one. But I shall not interfere\nfurther; at least not now. Still, I shall watch, and if at any time you\nseem to want a friend I will try and serve you.\"\n\n\"I thank you for your friendship.\"\n\n\"You seem to take it lightly enough. Why, sir, even now I do not believe\nyou know my power, any more than you guess my motive. You may be first\nman in this kingdom, but let me tell you I rank as second lady. And\nremember, women stand high in Atlantis now. Believe me, my friendship is\na commodity that has been sought with frequence and industry.\"\n\n\"And as I say, I am grateful for it. You seem to think little enough of\nmy gratitude, Ylga; but, credit me, I never have bestowed it on a woman\nbefore, and so you should treasure it for its rarity.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"my lord, there is an education before you.\" She left\nme then, showing me how to call slaves when I wished for their help, and\nfor a full minute I stood wondering at the words I had spoken to her.\nWho was the daughter of Zaemon that she should induce me to change the\nhabit of a lifetime?\n\nThe slaves came at my bidding, and showed themselves anxious to deck\nme with a thousand foolishnesses in the matter of robes and gauds, and\n(what seemed to be the modern fashion of their class) holding out the\nvirtues of a score of perfumes and unguents. Their manner irritated\nme. Clean I was already, and shaved; my hair was trim, and my robe was\nunsoiled; and, considering these pressing attentions of theirs something\nof an impertinence, I set them to beat one another as a punishment,\npromising that if they did not do it with thoroughness, I would hand\nthem on to the brander to be marked with stripes which would endure.\nIt is strange, but a common menial can often surpass even a rebellious\ngeneral in power of ruffling one.\n\nI had seen many strange sights that day, and undergone many new\nsensations; but of all the things which came to my notice, Phorenice's\nmanner of summoning the guests to her feast surprised me most. Nay, it\ndid more; it shocked me profoundly; and I cannot say whether amazement\nat her profanity, or wonder at her power, was for the moment strongest\nin my breast. I sat in my chamber awaiting the summons, when gradually,\ngrowing out of nothing, a sound fell upon my ear which increased in\nvolume with infinitely small graduations, till at last it became a\nclanging din which hurt the ear with its fierceness; and then (I guessed\nwhat was coming) the whole massive fabric of the pyramid trembled and\ngroaned and shook, as though it had been merely a child's wooden toy\nbrushed about by a strong man's sandal.\n\nIt was the portent served out yearly by the chiefs of the Priests' Clan\non the Sacred Mountain, when they bade all the world take count of their\nsins. It was the sacred reminder that from roaring, raging fire, and\nfrom the agony of monstrous earth-tremors, man had been born, and that\nby these same agencies he would eventually be swallowed up--he and\nthe sins within his breast. And here the Empress was prostituting its\nsolemnities into a mere call to gluttony, and sign for ribald laughter\nand sensuous display.\n\nBut how had she acquired the authority to do this thing? Who was she\nthat she should tamper with those dimly understood powers, the forces\nthat dwell within the liquid heart of our mother earth? Had there been\ntreachery? Had some member of the Priests' Clan forgotten his sacred\nvows, and babbled to this woman matters concerning the holy mysteries?\nOr had Phorenice discovered a key to these mysteries with her own agile\nbrain?\n\nIf that last was the case, I could continue to serve her with silent\nconscience. Though she might be none of my making, at least she was\nEmpress, and it was my duty to give her obedience. But if she had\nsuborned some weaker member of the Clan on the Sacred Mount, that would\nbe a different matter. For be it remembered that it was one of the\nelements of our constitution to preserve our secrets and mysteries\ninviolate, and to pursue with undying hatred both the man who had dared\nto betray them, and the unhappy recipient of his confidence.\n\nIt was with very undecided feelings, then, that I obeyed the summons of\nthe earth-shaking, and bade the slaves lead me through the windings of\nthe pyramid to the great banqueting-hall. The scene there was dazzling.\nThe majestic chamber with its marvellous carvings was filled with a\ncompany decked out with all the gauds and colours that fancy could\nconceive. Little recked they of the solemn portent which had summoned\nthem to the meal, of the death and misery that stalked openly through\nthe city wards without, of the rebels which lay in leaguer beyond the\nwalls, of the neglected Gods and their clan of priests on the Sacred\nMountain. They were all gluttonous for the passions of the moment; it\nwas their fashion and conceit to look at nothing beyond.\n\nFlaming jets of earth-breath lit the great hall to the brightness of\nmidday; and when I stepped out upon the pavement, trumpets blared, so\nthat all might know of my coming. But there was no roar of welcome.\n\"Deucalion,\" they lisped with mincing voices, bowing themselves\nridiculously to the ground so that all their ornaments and silks might\njangle and swish. Indeed, when Phorenice herself appeared, and all\nsent up their cries and made lawful obeisance, there was the same\nartificiality in the welcome. They meant well enough, it is true;\nbut this was the new fashion. Heartiness had come to be accounted a\nbarbarism by this new culture.\n\nA pair of posturing, smirking chamberlains took me in charge, and\nushered me with their flimsy golden wands to the dais at the farther\nend. It appeared that I was to sit on Phorenice's divan, and eat my meat\nout of her dish.\n\n\"There is no stint to the honour the Empress puts upon me,\" I said, as I\nknelt down and took my seat.\n\nShe gave me one of her queer, sidelong looks. \"Deucalion may have more\nbeside, if he asks for it prettily. He may have what all the other men\nin the known world have sighed for, and what none of them will ever\nget. But I have given enough of my own accord; he must ask me warmly for\nthose further favours.\"\n\n\"I ask,\" I said, \"first, that I may sweep the boundaries clear of this\nrabble which is clamouring against the city walls.\"\n\n\"Pah,\" she said, and frowned. \"Have you appetite only for the sterner\npleasures of life? My good Deucalion, they must have been rustic folk\nin that colony of yours. Well, you shall give me news now of the\ntoothsomeness of this feast.\"\n\nDishes and goblets were placed before us, and we began to eat, though I\nhad little enough appetite for victual so broken and so highly spiced.\nBut if this finicking cookery and these luscious wines did not appeal\nto me, the other diners in that gorgeous hall appreciated it all to the\nfull. They sat about in groups on the pavement beneath the light-jets\nlike a tangle of rainbows for colour, and according to the new custom\nthey went into raptures and ecstasies over their enjoyment. Women and\nmen both, they lingered over each titillation of the palate as though it\nwere a caress of the Gods.\n\nPhorenice, with her quick, bright eyes, looked on, and occasionally\nflung one or another a few words between her talk with me, and now and\nagain called some favoured creature up to receive a scrap of viand\nfrom the royal dish. This the honoured one would eat with extravagant\ngesture, or (as happened twice) would put it away in the folds of his\nclothes as a treasure too dear to be profaned by human lips.\n\nTo me, this flattery appeared gross and disgustful, but Phorenice,\nthrough use, perhaps, seemed to take it as merely her due. There was,\none had to suppose, a weakness in her somewhere, though truly to the\noutward seeing none was apparent. Her face was strong enough, and it was\nsubtle also, and, moreover, it was wondrous comely. All the courtiers in\nthe banqueting-hall raved about Phorenice's face and the other beauties\nof her body and limbs, and though not given to appreciation in these\nmatters, I could not but see that here at least they had a groundwork\nfor their admiration, for surely the Gods have never favoured mortal\nwoman more highly. Yet lovely though she might be, for myself I\npreferred to look upon Ylga, the girl, who, because of her rank, was\nprivileged to sit on the divan behind us as immediate attendant. There\nwas an honesty in Ylga's face which Phorenice's lacked.\n\nThey did not eat to nutrify their bodies, these feasters in the\nbanqueting-hall of the royal pyramid, but they all ate to cloy\nthemselves, and they strutted forth new usages with every platter and\nbowl that the slaves brought. To me some of their manners were\nclosely touching on disrespect. At the halfway of the meal, a gorgeous\npopinjay--he was a governor of an out-province driven into the capital\nby a rebellion in his own lands--this gorgeous fop, I say, walked up\nbetween the groups of feasters with flushed face and unsteady gait, and\ndid obeisance before the divan. \"Most astounding Empress,\" cried he,\n\"fairest among the Goddesses, Queen regnant of my adoring heart, hail!\"\n\nPhorenice with a smile stretched him out her cup. I looked to see him\npour respectful libation, but no such thing. He set the drink to his\nlips and drained it to the final drop. \"May all your troubles,\" he\ncried, \"pass from you as easily, and leave as pleasant a flavour.\"\n\nThe Empress turned to me with one of her quick looks. \"You do not like\nthis new habit?\"\n\nTo which I replied bluntly enough that to pour out liquor at a person's\nfeet had grown through custom to be a mark of respect, but that drinking\nit seemed to me mere self-indulgence, which might be practised anywhere.\n\n\"You still keep to the old austere teachings,\" she said. \"Our newer code\nbids us enjoy life first, and order other things so as not to meddle\nwith our more immediate pleasure.\"\n\nAnd so the feast went on, the guests practising their gluttonies and\ntheir absurdities, and the guards standing to their arms round the\ncircuit of the walls as motionless and as stern as the statues carven\nin the white stone beyond them. But a term was put to the orgy with\nsomething of suddenness. There was a stir at the farther doorway of the\nbanqueting-hall, and a clash, as two of the guards joined their spears\nacross the entrance. But the man they tried to stop--or perhaps it was\nto pin--passed them unharmed, and walked up over the pavement between\nthe lights, and the groups of feasters. All looked round at him; a few\nthrew him ribald words; but none ventured to stop his progress. A few,\nwomen chiefly, I could see, shuddered as he passed them by, as though a\nwintry chill had come over them; and in the end he walked up and stood\nin front of Phorenice's divan, and gazed fixedly on her, but without\nmaking obeisance.\n\nHe was a frail old man, with white hair tumbling on his shoulders, and\nragged white beard. The mud of wayfaring hung in clots on his feet and\nlegs. His wizened body was bare save for a single cloth wound about\nhis shoulders and his loins, and he carried in his hand a wand with the\nsymbol of our Lord the Sun glowing at its tip. That wand went to show\nhis caste, but in no other way could I recognize him.\n\nI took him for one of those ascetics of the Priests' Clan, who had\nforsworn the steady nurtured life of the Sacred Mountain, and who lived\nout in the dangerous lands amongst the burning hills, where there is\ndaily peril from falling rocks, from fire streams, from evil vapours,\nfrom sudden fissuring of the ground, and from other movements of those\nunstable territories, and from the greater lizards and other monstrous\nbeasts which haunt them. These keep constant in the memory the might of\nthe Holy Gods, and the insecurity of this frail earth on which we have\nour resting-place, and so the sojourners there become chastened in the\nspirit, and gain power over mysteries which even the most studious and\nlearned of other men can never hope to attain.\n\nA silence filled the room when the old man came to his halt, and\nPhorenice was the first to break it. \"Those two guards,\" she said, in\nher clear, carrying voice, \"who held the door, are not equal to their\nwork. I cannot have imperfect servants; remove them.\"\n\nThe soldiers next in the rank lifted their spears and drove them home,\nand the two fellows who had admitted the old man fell to the ground. One\nshrieked once, the other gave no sound: they were clever thrusts both.\n\nThe old man found his voice, thin, and high, and broken. \"Another crime\nadded to your tally, Phorenice. Not half your army could have hindered\nmy entrance had I wished to come, and let me tell you that I am here to\nbring you your last warning. The Gods have shown you much favour; they\ngave you merit by which you could rise above your fellows, till at last\nonly the throne stood above you. It was seen good by those on the Sacred\nMountain to let you have this last ambition, and sit on this throne\nthat has as long and honourably been filled by the ancient kings of\nAtlantis.\"\n\nThe Empress sat back on the divan smiling. \"I seemed to get these things\nas I chose, and in spite of your friends' teeth. I may owe to you, old\nman, a small parcel of thanks, though that I offered to repay; but for\nmy lords the priests, their permission was of small enough value when\nit came. I would have you remember that I was as firm on the throne of\nAtlantis as this pyramid stands upon its base when your worn-out priests\ncame up to give their tottering benediction.\"\n\nThe old man waved aside her interruption. \"Hear me out,\" he said. \"I am\nhere with no trivial message. There is nothing paltry about the threat\nI can throw at you, Phorenice. With your fire-tubes, your handling of\ntroops, and your other fiendish clevernesses, you may not be easy to\noverthrow by mere human means, though, forsooth, these poor rebels who\nyap against your city walls have contrived to hold their ground for long\nenough now. It may be that you are becoming enervated; I do not know.\nIt may be that you are too wrapped up in your feastings, your dressings,\nyour pomps, and your debaucheries, to find leisure to turn to the art\nof war. It may be that the man's spirit has gone out from your arm and\nbrain, and you are a woman once more--weak, and pleasure-loving; again I\ndo not know.\n\n\"But this must happen: You must undo the evil you have done; you must\ngive bread to the people who are starving, even if you take it from\nthese gluttons in this hall; you must restore Atlantis to the state in\nwhich it was entrusted to you: or else you must be removed. It cannot\nbe permitted that the country should sink back into the lawlessness\nand barbarism from which its ancient kings have digged it. You hear,\nPhorenice. Now give me true answer.\"\n\n\"Speak him fair. Oh! For the sake of your fortune, speak him fair,\" came\nYlga's voice in a hurried whisper from behind us. But the Empress took\nno notice of it. She leaned forward on the cushions of the divan with a\nknit brow.\n\n\"Do you dare to threaten me, old man, knowing what I am?\"\n\n\"I know your origin,\" he said gravely, \"as well as you know it yourself.\nAs for my daring, that is a small matter. He need be but a timid man who\ndares to say words that the High Gods put on his lips.\"\n\n\"I shall rule this kingdom as I choose. I shall brook interference from\nno creature on this earth, or beneath it, or in the sky above. The Gods\nhave chosen me to be Their regent in Atlantis, and They do not depose me\nthrough such creatures as you. Go away, old man, and play the fanatic in\nanother court. It is well that I have an ancient kindliness for you, or\nyou would not leave this place unharmed.\"\n\n\"Now, indeed, you are lost,\" I heard Ylga murmur from behind, and the\nold man in front of us did not move a step. Instead, he lifted up the\nSymbol of our Lord the Sun, and launched his curse. \"Your blasphemy\ngives the reply I asked for. Hear me now make declaration of war on\nbehalf of Those against whom you have thrown your insults. You shall be\noverthrown and sent to the nether Gods. At whatever cost the land shall\nbe purged of you and yours, and all the evil that has been done to it\nwhilst you have sullied the throne of its ancient kings. You will not\namend, neither will you yield tamely. You vaunt that you sit as firm on\nyour throne as this pyramid reposes on its base. See how little you\nknow of what the future carries. I say to you that, whilst you are yet\nEmpress, you shall see this royal pyramid which you have polluted\nwith your debaucheries torn tier from tier, and stone from stone, and\nscattered as feathers spread before a wind.\"\n\n\"You may wreck the pyramid,\" said Phorenice contemptuously. \"I myself\nhave some knowledge of the earth forces, as I have shown this night. But\nthough you crumble every stone above us now and grind it into grit and\ndust, I shall still be Empress. What force can you crazy priests bring\nagainst me that I cannot throw back and destroy?\"\n\n\"We have a weapon that was forged in no mortal smithy,\" shrilled the\nold man, \"whereof the key is now lodged in the Ark of the Mysteries. But\nthat weapon can be used only as a last resource. The nature of it even\nis too awful to be told in words. Our other powers will be launched\nagainst you first, and for this poor country's sake I pray that they may\ncause you to wince. Yet rest assured, Phorenice, that we shall not step\naside once we have put a hand to this matter. We shall carry it through,\neven though the cost be a universal burning and destruction. For know\nthis, daughter of the swineherd, it is agreed amongst the most High Gods\nthat you are too full of sin to continue unchecked.\"\n\n\"Speak him fairly,\" Ylga urged from behind. \"He has a power at which you\ncannot even guess.\"\n\nThe Empress made to rise, but Ylga clung to her skirt. \"For the sake of\nyour fame,\" she urged, \"for the sake of your life, do not defy him.\" But\nPhorenice struck her fiercely aside, and faced the old man in a tumult\nof passion. \"You dare call me a blasphemer, who blaspheme yourself? You\ndare cast slurs upon my birth, who am come direct from the most high\nHeaven? Old man, your craziness protects you in part, but not in all.\nYou shall be whipped. Do you hear me? I say, whipped. The lean flesh\nshall be scourged from your scraggy bones, and you shall totter away\nfrom this place as a red and bleeding example for those who would dare\ntraduce their Empress. Here, some of you, I say, take that man, and let\nhim be whipped where he stands.\"\n\nHer cry went out clearly enough. But not a soul amongst those glittering\nfeasters stirred in his place. Not a soldier amongst the guards stepped\nfrom his rank. The place was hung in a terrible silence. It seemed as\nthough no one within the hall dared so much as to draw a breath. All\nfelt that the very air was big with fate.\n\nPhorenice, with her head crouched forward, looked from one group to\nanother. Her face was working. \"Have I no true servants,\" she asked,\n\"amongst all you pretty lip-servers?\"\n\nStill no one moved. They stood, or sat, or crouched like people\nfascinated. For myself, with the first words he had uttered, I had\nrecognized the old man by his voice. It was Zaemon, the weak governor\nwho had given the Empress her first step towards power; that earnest\nsearcher into the mysteries, who knew more of their powers, and more\nabout the hidden forces, than any other dweller on the Sacred Mountain,\neven at that time when I left for my colony. And now, during his strange\nhermit life, how much more might he not have learned? I was torn by\nwarring duties. I owed much to the Priests' Clan, by reason of my oath\nand membership; it seemed I owed no less to Phorenice. And, again, was\nZaemon the truly accredited envoy of the high council of the priests of\nthe Sacred Mountain? And was the Empress of a truth deposed by the High\nGods above, or was she still Empress, and still the commander of my\nduty? I could not tell, and so I sat in my seat awaiting what the event\nwould sow.\n\nPhorenice's fury was growing. \"Do I stand alone here?\" she cried. \"Have\nI pampered you creatures out of all touch with gratitude? It seems that\nat last I want a new chief to my guards. Ho! Who will be chief of the\nguards of the Empress?\"\n\nThere was a shifting of eyes, a hesitation. Then a great burly form\nstrode up from the farther end of the hall, and a perceptible shudder\nwent up from all the others as they watched him.\n\n\"So, Tarca, you prefer to take the risks, and remain chief of the guard\nyourself?\" she said with an angry scoff. \"Truly there did not seem to be\nmany thrusting forward to strip you of the office. I shall have a fine\nsorting up of places in payment for this night's work. But for the\npresent, Tarca, do your duty.\"\n\nThe man came up, obviously timorous. He was a solidly made fellow, but\nnot altogether unmartial, and though but little of his cheek showed\nabove his decorated beard, I could see that he paled as he came near\nto the priest. \"My lord,\" he said quietly, \"I must ask you to come with\nme.\"\n\n\"Stand aside,\" said the old man, thrusting out the Symbol in front of\nhim. I could see his eyes gather on the soldier and his brows knit with\na strain of will.\n\nTarca saw this too, and I thought he would have fallen, but with an\neffort he kept his manhood, and doggedly repeated his summons. \"I must\nobey the command of my mistress, and I would have you remember, my lord,\nthat I am but a servant. You must come with me to the whip.\"\n\n\"I warn you!\" cried the old man. \"Stand from out of my path, you!\"\n\nIt must have been with the courage of desperation that the soldier dared\nto use force. But the hand he stretched out dropped limply back to his\nside the moment it touched the old man's bare shoulder, as though it had\nbeen struck by some shock. He seemed almost to have expected some such\nrepulse; yet when he picked up that hand with the other, and looked\nat it, and saw its whiteness, he let out of him a yell like a wounded\nbeast. \"Oh, Gods!\" he cried. \"Not that. Spare me!\"\n\nBut Zaemon was glowering at him still. A twitching seized the man's\nface, and he put up his sound hand to it and plucked at his beard,\nwhich was curled and plaited after the new fashion of the day. A woman\nstanding near screamed as the half of the beard came off in his fingers.\nBeneath was silver whiteness over half his face. Zaemon had smitten him\nwith a sudden leprosy that was past cure.\n\nYet the punishment was not ended even then. Other twitchings took him\non other parts of the body, and he tore off his armour and his foppish\nclothes, and always where the bare flesh showed, there had the horrid\nplague written its white mark; and in the end, being able to endure no\nmore, the man fell to the pavement and lay there writhing.\n\nZaemon said no further word. He lifted the Symbol before him, set\nhis eyes on the farther door of the banqueting-hall and walked for\nit directly, all those in his path shrinking away from him with open\nshudders. And through the valves of the door he passed out of our sight,\nstill wordless, still unchecked.\n\nI glanced up at Phorenice. The loveliness of her face was drawn and\nhaggard. It was the first great reverse, this, she had met with in\nall her life, and the shock of it, and the vision of what might follow\nafter, dazed her. Alas, if she could only have guessed at a tenth of the\nterrors which the future had in its womb, Atlantis might have been saved\neven then.\n\n\n\n\n6. THE BITERS OF THE CITY WALLS\n\n\nHere then was the manner of my reception back in the capital of\nAtlantis, and some first glimpse at her new policies. I freely confess\nto my own inaction and limpness; but it was all deliberate. The old ties\nof duty seemed lost, or at least merged in one another. Beforetime, to\nserve the king was to serve the Clan of the Priests, from which he had\nbeen chosen, and whose head he constituted. But Phorenice was self-made,\nand appeared to be a rule unto herself; if Zaemon was to be trusted,\nhe was the mouthpiece of the Priests, and their Clan had set her at\ndefiance; and how was a mere honest man to choose on the instant between\nthe two?\n\nBut cold argument told me that governments were set up for the good\nof the country at large, and I said to myself that there would be my\nchoice. I must find out which rule promised best of Atlantis, and do my\npoor best to prop it into full power. And here at once there opened up\nanother path in the maze: I had heard some considerable talk of rebels;\nof another faction of Atlanteans who, whatever their faults might be,\nwere at any rate strong enough to beleaguer the capital; and before\ncoming to any final decision, it would be as well to take their claims\nin balance with the rest. So on the night of that very same day on which\nI had just re-planted my foot on the old country's shores, I set out to\nglean for myself tidings on the matter.\n\nNo one inside the royal pyramid gainsaid me. The banquet had ended\nabruptly with the terrible scene that I have set down above on these\ntablets, for with Tarca writhing on the floor, and thrusting out the\ngruesome scars of his leprosy, even the most gluttonous had little\nenough appetite for further gorging. Phorenice glowered on the feasters\nfor a while longer in silent fury, but saying no further word; and then\nher eyes turned on me, though softened somewhat.\n\n\"You may be an honest man, Deucalion,\" she said, at length, \"but you are\na monstrous cold one. I wonder when you will thaw?\" And here she smiled.\n\"I think it will be soon. But for now I bid you farewell. In the morning\nwe will take this country by the shoulders, and see it in some new\norder.\"\n\nShe left the banqueting-hall then, Ylga following; and taking\nprecedence of my rank, I went out next, whilst all others stood and made\nsalutation. But I halted by Tarca first, and put my hand on his unclean\nflesh. \"You are an unfortunate man,\" I said, \"but I can admire a brave\nsoldier. If relief can be gained for your plague, I will use interest to\nprocure it for you.\"\n\nThe man's thanks came in a mumble from his wrecked mouth, and some of\nthose near shuddered in affected disgust. I turned on them with a\nblack brow: \"Your charity, my lords, seems of as small account as\nyour courage. You affected a fine disbelief of Zaemon's sayings, and\na simpering contempt for his priesthood, but when it comes to laying\na hand on him, you show a discretion which, in the old days, we should\nhave called by an ugly name. I had rather be Tarca, with all his\nuncleanness, than any of you now as you stand.\"\n\nWith which leave-taking I waited coldly till they gave me my due\nsalutation, and then walked out of the banqueting-hall without offering\na soul another glance. I took my way to the grand gate of the pyramid,\ncalled for the officer of the guard, and demanded exit. The man was\nobsequious enough, but he opened with some demur.\n\n\"My lord's attendants have not yet come up?\"\n\n\"I have none.\"\n\n\"My lord knows the state of the streets?\"\n\n\"I did twenty years back. I shall be able to pick my way.\"\n\n\"My lord must remember that the city is beleaguered,\" the fellow\npersisted. \"The people are hungry. They prowl in bands after nightfall,\nand--I make no question that my lord would conquer in a fight against\nwhatever odds, but--\"\n\n\"Quite right. I covet no street scuffle to-night. Lend me, I pray you,\na sufficiency of men. You will know best what are needed. For me, I am\naccustomed to a city with quiet streets.\"\n\nA score of sturdy fellows were detailed off for my escort, and with them\nin a double file on either hand, I marched out from the close perfumed\nair of the pyramid into the cool moonlight of the city. It was my\npurpose to make a tour of the walls and to find out somewhat of the\ndisposition of these rebels.\n\nBut the Gods saw fit to give me another education first. The city, as I\nsaw it during that night walk, was no longer the old capital that I had\nknown, the just accretion of the ages, the due admixture of comfort and\nsplendour. The splendour was there, vastly increased. Whole wards had\nbeen swept away to make space for new palaces, and new pyramids of the\nwealthy, and I could not but have an admiration for the skill and the\nbrain which made possible such splendid monuments.\n\nAnd, indeed, gazing at them there under the silver of the moonlight,\nI could almost understand the emotions of the Europeans and other\nbarbarous savages which cause them to worship all such great buildings\nas Gods, since they deem them too wonderful and majestic to be set up by\nhuman hands unaided.\n\nStill, if it was easy to admire, it was simple also to see plain\nadvertisement of the cost at which these great works had been reared.\nFrom each grant of ground, where one of these stately piles earned\nsilver under the moon, a hundred families had been evicted and left to\nharbour as they pleased in the open; and, as a consequence, now every\nniche had its quota of sleepers, and every shadow its squad of fierce\nwild creatures, ready to rush out and rob or slay all wayfarers of less\nforce than their own.\n\nMyself, I am no pamperer of the common people. I say that, if a man be\nleft to hunger and shiver, he will work to gain him food and raiment;\nand if not, why then he can die, and the State is well rid of a\nworthless fellow. But here beside us, as we marched through many wards,\nwere marks of blind oppression; starved dead bodies, with the bones\nstarting through the lean skin, sprawled in the gutter; and indeed\nit was plain that, save for the favoured few, the people of the great\ncapital were under a most heavy oppression.\n\nBut at this, though I might regret it abominably, I could make no strong\ncomplaint. By the ancient law of the land all the people, great and\nsmall, were the servants of the king, to be put without question to what\npurposes he chose; and Phorenice stood in the place of the king. So I\ntried to think no treason, but with a sigh passed on, keeping my eyes\nabove the miseries and the squalors of the roadway, and sending out my\nthoughts to the stars which hung in the purple night above, and to\nthe High Gods which dwelt amongst them, seeking, if it might be, for\nguidance for my future policies. And so in time the windings of the\nstreets brought us to the walls, and, coursing beside these and giving\nfitting answer to the sentries who beat their drums as we passed, we\ncame in time to that great gate which was a charge to the captain of the\ngarrison.\n\nHere it was plain there was some special commotion. A noise of laughter\nwent up into the still night air, and with it now and again the snarl\nand roar of a great beast, and now and again the shriek of a hurt man.\nBut whatever might be afoot, it was not a scene to come upon suddenly.\nThe entrance gates of our great capital were designed by their ancient\nbuilders to be no less strong than the walls themselves. Four pairs\nof valves were there, each a monstrous block of stone two man-heights\nsquare, and a man-height thick, and the wall was doubled to receive\nthem, enclosing an open circus between its two parts. The four gates\nthemselves were set one at the inner, one at the outer side of each of\nthese walls, and a hidden machinery so connected them, that of each set\none could not open till the other was closed; and as for forcing them\nwithout war engines, one might as foolishly try to push down the royal\npyramid with the bare hand.\n\nMy escort made outcry with the horn which hung from the wall inviting\nsuch a summons, and a warder came to an arrow-slit, and did inspection\nof our persons and business. His survey was according to the ancient\nform of words, which is long, and this was made still more tedious by\nthe noise from within, which ever and again drowned all speech between\nus entirely.\n\nBut at last the formalities had been duly complied with, and he shot\nback the massive bars and bolts of stone, and threw ajar one monstrous\nstone valve of the door. Into the chamber within--a chamber made from\nthe thickness of the wall between the two doors--I and my fellows\ncrowded, and then the warder with his machines pulled to the valve which\nhad been opened, and came to me again through the press of my escort,\nbowing low to the ground.\n\n\"I have no vail to give you,\" I said abruptly. \"Get on with your duty.\nOpen me that other door.\"\n\n\"With respect, my lord, it would be better that I should first announce\nmy lord's presence. There is a baiting going forward in the circus, and\nthe tigers are as yet mere savages, and no respecters of persons.\"\n\n\"The what?\"\n\n\"The tigers, if my lord will permit them the name. They are baiting a\nbatch of prisoners with the two great beasts which the Empress (whose\nname be adored) has sent here to aid us keep the gate. But if my\nlord will, there are the ward rooms leading off this passage, and the\ngalleries which run out from them commanding the circus, and from there\nmy lord can see the sport undisturbed.\"\n\nNow, the mere lust for killing excites only disgust in me, but I\nsuspected the orders of the Empress in this matter, and had a curiosity\nto see her scheme. So I stepped into the warder's lodge, and on into\nthe galleries which commanded the circus with their arrow-slits. The old\nbuilders of the place had intended these for a second line of defence,\nfor, supposing the outer doors all forced, an enemy could be speedily\nshot down in the circus, without being able to give a blow in return,\nand so would only march into a death-trap. But as a gazing-place on a\nspectacle they were no less useful.\n\nThe circus was bright lit by the moonlight, and the air which came in to\nme from it was acrid with the reek of blood. There was no sport in\nwhat was going forward: as I said, it was mere killing, and the sight\ndisgusted me. I am no prude about this matter. Give a prisoner his\nweapons, put him in a pit with beasts of reasonable strength, and let\nhim fight to a finish if you choose, and I can look on there and applaud\nthe strokes. The war prisoner, being a prisoner, has earned death by\nnatural law, and prefers to get his last stroke in hot blood than to\nbe knocked down by the headsman's axe. And it is any brave man's luxury\neither to help or watch a lusty fight. But this baiting in the circus\nbetween the gates was no fair battle like that.\n\nTo begin with, the beasts were no fair antagonists for single men. In\nfact, twenty men armed might well have fled from them. When the warder\nsaid tigers, I supposed he meant the great cats of the woods. But here,\nin the circus, I saw a pair of the most terrific of all the fur-bearing\nland beasts, the great tigers of the caves--huge monsters, of such\nponderous strength that in hunger they will oftentimes drag down a\nmammoth, if they can find him away from his herd.\n\nHow they had been brought captive I could not tell. Hunter of beasts\nthough I had been for all my days, I take no shame in saying that\nI always approached the slaying of a cave-tiger with stratagem and\ninfinite caution. To entrap it alive and bring it to a city on a chain\nwas beyond my most daring schemes, and I have been accredited with more\nnew things than one. But here it was in fact, and I saw in these captive\nbeasts a new certificate for Phorenice's genius.\n\nThe purpose of these two cave-tigers was plain: whilst they were in\nthe circus, and loose, no living being could cross from one gate to\nthe other. They were a new and sturdy addition to the defences of the\ncapital. A collar of bronze was round the throat of each, and on the\ncollar was a massive chain which led to the wall, where it could be\npayed out or hauled in by means of a windlass in one of the hidden\ngalleries. So that at ordinary moments the two huge beasts could be\ntethered, one close to either end of the circus, as the litter of bones\nand other messes showed, leaving free passage-way between the two sets\nof doors.\n\nBut when I stood there by the arrow-slit, looking down into the\nmoonlight of the circus, these chains were slackened (though men stood\nby the windlass of each), and the great striped brutes were prowling\nabout the circus with the links clanking and chinking in their wake.\nLying stark on the pavement were the bodies of some eight men, dead\nand uneaten; and though the cave-tigers stopped their prowlings now and\nagain to nuzzle these, and beat them about with playful paw-blows, they\nmade no pretence at commencing a meal. It was clear that this cruel\nsport had grown common to them, and they knew there were other victims\nyet to be added to the tally.\n\nPresently, sure enough, as I watched, a valve of the farther gate swung\nback an arm's length, and a prisoner, furiously resisting, was thrust\nout into the circus. He fell on his face, and after one look around him\nhe lay resolutely still, with eyes on the ground passively awaiting\nhis fate. The ponderous stone of the gate clapped to in its place; the\ncave-tigers turned in their prowlings; and a chatter of wagers ran to\nand fro amongst the watchers behind the arrow-slits.\n\nIt seemed there were niceties of cruelty in this wretched game. There\nwas a sharp clank as the windlasses were manned, and the tethering\nchains were drawn in by perhaps a score of links. One of the cave-tigers\ncrouched, lashed its tail, and launched forth on a terrific spring.\nThe chain tautened, the massive links sang to the strain, and the great\nbeast gave a roar which shook the walls. It had missed the prone man by\na hand's breadth, and the watchers behind the arrow-slits shrieked forth\ntheir delight. The other tiger sprang also and missed, and again there\nwere shouts of pleasure, which mingled with the bellowing voices of the\nbeasts. The man lay motionless in his form. One more cowardly, or\none more brave, might have run from death, or faced it; but this poor\nprisoner chose the middle course--he permitted death to come to him, and\nhad enough of doggedness to wait for it without stir.\n\nThe great cave-tigers were used, it appeared, to this disgusting sport.\nThere were no more wild springs, no more stubbings at the end of the\nmassive chains. They lay down on the pavement, and presently began to\npurr, rolling on to their sides and rubbing themselves luxuriously. The\nprisoner still lay motionless in his form.\n\nBy slow degrees the monstrous brutes each drew to the end of its chain\nand began to reach at the man with out-stretched forepaw. The male could\nnot touch him; the female could just reach him with the far tip of a\nclaw; and I saw a red scratch start up in the bare skin of his side at\nevery stroke. But still the prisoner would not stir. It seemed to me\nthat they must slack out more links of one of the tigers' chains, or let\nthe vile play linger into mere tediousness.\n\nBut I had more to learn yet. The male tiger, either taught by his\nown devilishness, or by those brutes that were his keepers, had still\nanother ruse in store. He rose to his feet and turned round, backing\nagainst the chain. A yell of applause from the hidden men behind\nthe arrow-slits told that they knew what was in store; and then the\nmonstrous beast, stretched to the utmost of its vast length, kicked\nsharply with one hind paw.\n\nI heard the crunch of the prisoner's ribs as the pads struck him, and at\nthat same moment the poor wretch's body was spurned away by the blow, as\none might throw a fruit with the hand. But it did not travel far. It was\nclear that the she-tiger knew this manoeuvre of her mate's. She caught\nthe man on his bound, nuzzling over him for a minute, and then tossing\nhim high into the air, and leaping up to the full of her splendid height\nafter him.\n\nThose other onlookers thought it magnificent; their gleeful shouts said\nas much. But for me, my gorge rose at the sight. Once the tigers\nhad reached him, the man had been killed, it is true, without any\nunnecessary lingering. Even a light blow from those terrific paws would\nslay the strongest man living. But to see the two cave-tigers toying\nwith the poor body was an insult to the pride of our race.\n\nHowever, I was not there to preach the superiority of man to the\nbeasts, and the indecency and degradation of permitting man to be unduly\ninsulted. I had come to learn for myself the new balance of things\nin the kingdom of Atlantis, and so I stood at my place behind the\narrow-slit with a still face. And presently another scene in this\nghastly play was enacted.\n\nThe cave-tigers tired of their sport, and first one and then the other\nfell once more to prowling over the littered pavements, with the heavy\nchains scraping and chinking in their wake. They made no beginning to\nfeast on the bodies provided for them. That would be for afterwards. In\nthe present, the fascination of slaughter was big in them, and they\nhad thought that it would be indulged further. It seemed that they knew\ntheir entertainers.\n\nAgain the windlass clanked, and the tethering chains drew the great\nbeasts clear of the doorway; and again a valve of the farther door swung\najar, and another prisoner was thrust struggling into the circus. A\nsickness seized me when I saw that this was a woman, but still, in view\nof the object I had in hand, I made no interruption.\n\nIt was not that I had never seen women sent to death before. A general,\nwho has done his fighting, must in his day have killed women equally\nwith men; yes, and seen them earn their death-blow by lusty battling.\nYet there seemed something so wanton in this cruel helpless sacrifice\nof a woman prisoner, that I had a struggle with myself to avoid\ninterference. Still it is ever the case that the individual must be\nsacrificed to a policy, and so as I say, I watched on, outwardly cold\nand impassive.\n\nI watched too (I confess it freely) with a quickening heart. Here was no\nsullen submissive victim like the last. She may have been more cowardly\n(as some women are), she may have been braver (as many women have shown\nthemselves); but, at any rate, it was clear that she was going to make a\nstruggle for her life, and to do vicious damage, it might be, before\nshe yielded it up. The watchers behind the arrow-slits recognized this.\nTheir wagers, and the hum of their appreciation, swept loudly round the\nring of the circus.\n\nThey stripped their prisoners, before they thrust them out to this\ndeath, of all the clothes they might carry, for clothes have a value;\nand so the woman stood there bare-limbed in the moonlight.\n\nShe clapped her back to the great stone door by which she had entered,\nand faced fate with glowing eye. Gods! there have been times in early\nyears when I could have plucked out sword and jumped down, and fought\nfor her there for the sheer delight of such a battle. But now policy\nrestrained me. The individual might want a helping hand, but it was\nbecoming more and more clear that Atlantis wanted a minister also; and\nbefore these great needs, the lesser ones perforce must perish. Still,\nbe it noted that, if I did not jump down, no other man there that night\nhad sufficient manhood remaining to venture the opportunity.\n\nMy heart glowed as I watched her. She picked a bone from the litter on\nthe pavement and beat off its head by blows against the wall. Then with\nher teeth she fashioned the point to still further sharpness. I could\nsee her teeth glisten white in the moonrays as she bit with them.\n\nThe huge cave-tigers, which stood as high as her head as they walked,\ncame nearer to her in their prowlings, yet obviously neglected her. This\nwas part of their accustomed scheme of torment, and the woman knew it\nwell. There was something intolerable in their noiseless, ceaseless\npaddings over the pavement. I could see the prisoner's breast heave as\nshe watched them. A terror such as that would have made many a victim\nsick and helpless.\n\nBut this one was bolder than I had thought. She did not wait for a\nspring: she made the first attack herself. When the she-tiger made its\nstroll towards her, and was in the act of turning, she flung herself\ninto a sudden leap, striking viciously at its eye with her sharpened\nbone. A roar from the onlookers acknowledged the stroke. The\ncave-tiger's eye remained undarkened, but the puny weapon had dealt it\na smart flesh wound, and with a great bellow of surprise and pain it\nscampered away to gain space for a rush and a spring.\n\nBut the woman did not await its charge. With a shrill scream she sped\nforward, running at the full of her speed across the moonlight directly\ntowards that shadowed part of the encircling wall within whose thickness\nI had my gazing place; and then, throwing every tendon of her body into\nthe spring, made the greatest leap that surely any human being\never accomplished, even when spurred on by the utmost of terror and\ndesperation. In an after day I measured it, and though of a certainty\nshe must have added much to the tally by the sheer force of her run,\nwhich drove her clinging up the rough surface of the wall, it is a sure\nthing that in that splendid leap her feet must have dangled a man-height\nand a half above the pavement.\n\nI say it was prodigious, but then the spur was more than the ordinary,\nand the woman herself was far out of the common both in thews and\nintelligence; and the end of the leap left her with five fingers lodged\nin the sill of the arrow-slit from which I watched. Even then she must\nhave slipped back if she had been left to herself, for the sill sloped,\nand the stone was finely smooth; but I shot out my hand and gripped\nhers by the wrist, and instantly she clambered up with both knees on the\nsills, and her fingers twined round to grip my wrist in her turn.\n\nAnd now you will suppose she gushed out prayers and promises, thinking\nonly of safety and enlargement. There was nothing of this. With savage\npanting wordlessness she took fresh grip on the sharpened bone with her\nspare hand, and lunged with it desperately through the arrow-slit. With\nthe hand that clutched mine she drew me towards her, so as to give the\nblows the surer chance, and so unprepared was I for such an attack, and\nwith such fierce suddenness did she deliver it, that the first blow was\nnear giving me my quietus. But I grappled with the poor frantic creature\nas gently as might be--the stone of the wall separating us always--and\nstripped her of her weapon, and held her firmly captive till she might\ncalm herself.\n\n\"That was an ungrateful blow,\" I said. \"But for my hand you'd have\nslipped and be the sport of a tiger's paw this minute.\"\n\n\"Oh, I must kill some one,\" she panted, \"before I am killed myself.\"\n\n\"There will be time enough to think upon that some other day; but for\nnow you are far enough off meeting further harm.\"\n\n\"You are lying to me. You will throw me to the beasts as soon as I loose\nmy grip. I know your kind: you will not be robbed of your sport.\"\n\n\"I will go so far as to prove myself to you,\" said I, and called out for\nthe warder who had tended the doors below. \"Bid those tigers be tethered\non a shorter chain,\" I ordered, \"and then go yourself outside into the\ncircus, and help this lady delicately to the ground.\"\n\nThe word was passed and these things were done; and I too came out into\nthe circus and joined the woman, who stood waiting under the moonlight.\nBut the others who had seen these doings were by no means suited at the\nchange of plan. One of the great stone valves of the farther door opened\nhurriedly, and a man strode out, armed and flushed. \"By all the Gods!\"\nhe shouted. \"Who comes between me and my pastime?\"\n\nI stepped quietly to the advance. \"I fear, sir,\" I said, \"that you must\nlaunch your anger against me. By accident I gave that woman sanctuary,\nand I had not heart to toss her back to your beasts.\"\n\nHis fingers began to snap against his hilt.\n\n\"You have come to the wrong market here with your qualms. I am captain\nhere, and my word carries, subject only to Phorenice's nod. Do you\nhear that? Do you know too that I can have you tossed to those striped\ngate-keepers of mine for meddling in here without an invitation?\" He\nlooked at me sharp enough, but saw plainly that I was a stranger. \"But\nperhaps you carry a name, my man, which warrants your impertinence?\"\n\n\"Deucalion is my poor name,\" I said, \"but I cannot expect you will know\nit. I am but newly landed here, sir, and when I left Atlantis some score\nof years back, a very different man to you held guard over these gates.\"\nHe had his forehead on my feet by this time. \"I had it from the Empress\nthis night that she will to-morrow make a new sorting of this kingdom's\ndignities. Perhaps there is some recommendation you would wish me to lay\nbefore her in return for your courtesies?\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said the man, \"if you wish it, I can have a turn with those\ncave-tigers myself now, and you can look on from behind the walls and\nsee them tear me.\"\n\n\"Why tell me what is no news?\"\n\n\"I wish to remind my lord of his power; I wish to beg of his clemency.\"\n\n\"You showed your power to these poor prisoners; but from what remains\nhere to be seen, few of them have tasted much of your clemency.\"\n\n\"The orders were,\" said the captain of the gate, as though he thought a\nword might be said here for his defence, \"the orders were, my lord, that\nthe tigers should be kept fierce and accustomed to killing.\"\n\n\"Then, if you have obeyed orders, let me be the last to chide you.\nBut it is my pleasure that this woman be respited, and I wish now to\nquestion her.\"\n\nThe man got to his feet again with obvious relief, though still bowing\nlow.\n\n\"Then if my lord will honour me by sitting in my room that overlooks the\nouter gate, the favour will never be forgotten.\"\n\n\"Show the way,\" I said, and took the woman by the fingers, leading her\ngently. At the two ends of the circus the tigers prowled about on short\nchains, growling and muttering.\n\nWe passed through the door into the thickness of the outer wall, and the\ncaptain of the gate led us into his private chamber, a snug enough box\noverlooking the plain beyond the city. He lit a torch from his lamp\nand thrust it into a bracket on the wall, and bowing deeply and walking\nbackwards, left us alone, closing the door in place behind him. He was\nan industrious fellow, this captain, to judge from the spoil with\nwhich his chamber was packed. There could have come very few traders in\nthrough that gate below without his levying a private tribute; and so,\njudging that most of his goods had been unlawfully come by, I had little\nqualm at making a selection. It was not decent that the woman, being\nan Atlantean, should go bereft of the dignity of clothes, as though\nshe were a mere savage from Europe; and so I sought about amongst the\ncaptain's spoil for garments that would be befitting.\n\nBut, as I busied myself in this search for raiment, rummaging amongst\nthe heaps and bales, with a hand and eye little skilled in such\nbusiness, I heard a sound behind which caused me to turn my head, and\nthere was the woman with a dagger she had picked from the floor, in the\nact of drawing it from the sheath.\n\nShe caught my eye and drew the weapon clear, but seeing that I made no\nadvance towards her, or move to protect myself, waited where she was,\nand presently was took with a shuddering.\n\n\"Your designs seem somewhat of a riddle,\" I said. \"At first you\nwished to kill me from motives which you explained, and which I quite\nunderstood. It lay in my power next to confer some small benefit\nupon you, in consequence of which you are here, and not--shall we\nsay?--yonder in the circus. Why you should desire now to kill the only\nman here who can set you completely free, and beyond these walls, is a\nthing it would gratify me much to learn. I say nothing of the trifle of\ningratitude. Gratitude and ingratitude are of little weight here. There\nis some far greater in your mind.\"\n\nShe pressed a hand hard against her breasts. \"You are Deucalion,\" she\ngasped; \"I heard you say it.\"\n\n\"I am Deucalion. So far, I have known no reason to feel shame for my\nname.\"\n\n\"And I come of those,\" she cried, with a rising voice, \"who bite against\nthis city, because they have found their fate too intolerable with the\nland as it is ordered now. We heard of your coming from Yucatan. It was\nwe who sent the fleet to take you at the entrance to the Gulf.\"\n\n\"Your fleet gave us a pretty fight.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know, I know. We had our watchers on the high land who brought us\nthe tidings. We had an omen even before that. Where we lay with our army\nbefore the walls here, we saw great birds carrying off the slain to the\nmountains. But where the fleet failed, I saw a chance where I, a woman,\nmight--\"\n\n\"Where you might succeed?\" I sat me down on a pile of the captain's\nstuffs. It seemed as if here at last that I should find a solution for\nmany things. \"You carry a name?\" I asked.\n\n\"They call me Nais.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" I said, and signed to her to take the clothes that I had sought\nout. She was curiously like, so both my eyes and hearing said, to Ylga,\nthe fan-girl of Phorenice, but as she had told me of no parentage I\nasked for none then. Still her talk alone let me know that she was bred\nof none of the common people, and I made up my mind towards definite\nunderstanding. \"Nais,\" I said, \"you wish to kill me. At the same time I\nhave no doubt you wish to live on yourself, if only to get credit from\nyour people for what you have done. So here I will make a contract with\nyou. Prove to me that my death is for Atlantis' good, and I swear by our\nLord the Sun to go out with you beyond the walls, where you can stab me\nand then get you gone. Or the--\"\n\n\"I will not be your slave.\"\n\n\"I do not ask you for service. Or else, I wished to say, I shall live\nso long as the High Gods wish, and do my poor best for this country. And\nfor you--I shall set you free to do your best also. So now, I pray you,\nspeak.\"\n\n\n\n\n7. THE BITERS OF THE WALLS (FURTHER ACCOUNT)\n\n\n\"You will set me free,\" she said, regarding me from under her brows,\n\"without any further exactions or treaty?\"\n\n\"I will set you free exactly on those terms,\" I answered, \"unless indeed\nwe here decide that it is better for Atlantis that I should die, in\nwhich case the freedom will be of your own taking.\"\n\n\"My lord plays a bold game.\"\n\n\"Tut, tut,\" I said.\n\n\"But I shall not hesitate to take the full of my bond, unless my\ntheories are most clearly disproved to me.\"\n\n\"Tut,\" I said, \"you women, how you can play out the time needlessly.\nShow me sufficient cause, and you shall kill me where and how you\nplease. Come, begin the accusation.\"\n\n\"You are a tyrant.\"\n\n\"At least I have not paraded my tyrannies in Atlantis these twenty\nyears. Why, Nais, I did but land yesterday.\"\n\n\"You will not deny you came back from Yucatan for a purpose.\"\n\n\"I came back because I was sent for. The Empress gives no reasons for\nher recalls. She states her will; and we who serve her obey without\nquestion.\"\n\n\"Pah, I know that old dogma.\"\n\n\"If you discredit my poor honesty at the outset like this, I fear we\nshall not get far with our unravelling.\"\n\n\"My lord must be indeed simple,\" said this strange woman scornfully, \"if\nhe is ignorant of what all Atlantis knows.\"\n\n\"Then simple you must write me down. Over yonder in Yucatan we were too\nwell wrapped up in our own parochial needs and policies to have\nleisure to ponder much over the slim news which drifted out to us from\nAtlantis--and, in truth, little enough came. By example, Phorenice\n(whose office be adored) is a great personage here at home; but over\nthere in the colony we barely knew so much as her name. Here, since I\nhave been ashore, I have seen many new wonders; I have been carried by a\nriding mammoth; I have sat at a banquet; but in what new policies there\nare afoot, I have yet to be schooled.\"\n\n\"Then, if truly you do not know it, let me repeat to you the common\ntale. Phorenice has tired of her unmated life.\"\n\n\"Stay there. I will hear no word against the Empress.\"\n\n\"Pah, my lord, your scruples are most decorous. But I did no more than\nrepeat what the Empress had made public by proclamation. She is minded\nto take to herself a husband, and nothing short of the best is good\nenough for Phorenice. One after another has been put up in turn as\nfavourite--and been found wanting. Oh, I tell you, we here in Atlantis\nhave watched her courtship with jumping hearts. First it was this one\nhere, then it was that one there; now it was this general just returned\nfrom a victory, and a day later he had been packed back to his camp, to\ngive place to some dashing governor who had squeezed increased revenues\nfrom his province. But every ship that came from the West said that\nthere was a stronger man than any of these in Yucatan, and at last the\nEmpress changed the wording of her vow. 'I'll have Deucalion for my\nhusband,' said she, 'and then we will see who can stand against my\nwishes.'\"\n\n\"The Empress (whose name be adored) can do as she pleases in such\nmatters,\" I said guardedly; \"but that is beside the argument. I am here\nto know how it would be better for Atlantis that I should die?\"\n\n\"You know you are the strongest man in the kingdom.\"\n\n\"It pleases you to say so.\"\n\n\"And Phorenice is the strongest woman.\"\n\n\"That is beyond doubt.\"\n\n\"Why, then, if the Empress takes you in marriage, we shall be under a\ndouble tyranny. And her rule alone is more cruelly heavy than we can\nbear already.\"\n\n\"I pass no criticism on Phorenice's rule. I have not seen it. But I\ncrave your mercy, Nais, on the newcomer into this kingdom. I am strong,\nsay you, and therefore I am a tyrant, say you. Now to me this sequence\nis faulty.\"\n\n\"Who should a strong man use strength for, if not for himself? And if\nfor himself, why that spells tyranny. You will get all your heart's\ndesires, my lord, and you will forget that many a thousand of the common\npeople will have to pay for them.\"\n\n\"And this is all your accusation?\"\n\n\"It seems to be black enough. I am one that has a compassion for my\nfellow-men, my lord, and because of that compassion you see me what I am\nto-day. There was a time, not long passed, when I slept as soft and ate\nas dainty as any in Atlantis.\"\n\nI smiled. \"Your speech told me that much from the first.\"\n\n\"Then I would I had cast the speech off, too, if that is also a livery\nof the tyrant's class. But I tell you I saw all the oppression myself\nfrom the oppressor's side. I was high in Phorenice's favour then.\"\n\n\"That, too, is easy of credence. Ylga is the fan-girl to the Empress\nnow, and second lady in the kingdom, and those who have seen Ylga could\nmake an easy guess at the parentage of Nais.\"\n\n\"We were the daughters of one birth; but I do not count with either\nZaemon or Ylga now. Ylga is the creature of Phorenice, and Phorenice\nwould have all the people of Atlantis slaves and in chains, so that\nshe might crush them the easier. And as for Zaemon, he is no friend of\nPhorenice's; he fights with brain and soul to drag the old authority\nto those on the Sacred Mountain; and that, if it come down on us again,\nwould only be the exchange of one form of slavery for another.\"\n\n\"It seems to me you bite at all authority.\"\n\n\"In fact,\" she said simply, \"I do. I have seen too much of it.\"\n\n\"And so you think a rule of no-rule would be best for the country?\"\n\n\"You have put it plainly in words for me. That is my creed to-day. That\nis the creed of all those yonder, who sit in the camp and besiege this\ncity. And we number on our side, now, all in Atlantis save those in the\ncity and a handful on the priests' Mountain.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"A creed of desperation, if you like, Nais, but,\nbelieve me, a silly creed. Since man was born out of the quakings and\nthe fevers of this earth, and picked his way amongst the cooler-places,\nhe has been dependent always on his fellow-men. And where two are\ncongregated together, one must be chief, and order how matters are to be\ngoverned--at least, I speak of men who have a wish to be higher than the\nbeasts. Have you ever set foot in Europe?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I have. Years back I sailed there, gathering slaves. What did I see? A\ncountry without rule or order. Tyrants they were, to be sure, but they\nwere the beasts. The men and the women were the rudest savages, knowing\nnothing of the arts, dressing in skins and uncleanness, harbouring in\ncaves and the tree-tops. The beasts roamed about where they would, and\nhunted them unchecked.\"\n\n\"Still, they fought you for their liberty?\"\n\n\"Never once. They knew how disastrous was their masterless freedom. Even\nto their dull, savage brains it was a sure thing that no slavery could\nbe worse; and to that state you, and your friends, and your theories,\nwill reduce Atlantis, if you get the upper hand. But, then, to argue\nin a circle, you will never get it. For to conquer, you must set up\nleaders, and once you have set them up, you will never pull them down\nagain.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" she said with a sigh, \"there is truth in that last.\"\n\nThe torch had filled the captain's room with a resinous smoke, but the\nflame was growing pale. Dawn was coming in greyly through a slender\narrow-slit, and with it ever and again the glow from some mountain out\nof sight, which was shooting forth spasmodic bursts of fire. With it\nalso were mutterings of distant falling rocks, and sullen tremblings,\nwhich had endured all the night through, and I judged that earth was in\none of her quaking moods, and would probably during the forthcoming day\noffer us some chastening discomforts.\n\nOn this account, perhaps, my senses were stilled to certain evidences\nwhich would otherwise have given me a suspicion; and also, there is no\ndenying that my general wakefulness was sapped by another matter. This\nwoman, Nais, interested me vastly out of the common; the mere presence\nof her seemed to warm the organs of my interior; and whilst she was\nthere, all my thoughts and senses were present in the room of the\ncaptain of the gate in which we sat.\n\nBut of a sudden the floor of the chamber rocked and fell away beneath\nme, and in a tumult of dust, and litter, and bales of the captain's\nplunder, I fell down (still seated on the flagstone) into a pit which\nhad been digged beneath it. With the violence of the descent, and the\nflutter of all these articles about my head, I was in no condition for\nimmediate action; and whilst I was still half-stunned by the shock, and\nlong before I could get my eyes into service again, I had been seized,\nand bound, and half-strangled with a noose of hide. Voices were raised\nthat I should be despatched at once out of the way; but one in authority\ncried out that, killing me at leisure, and as a prisoner, promised more\ngenteel sport; and so I was thrust down on the floor, whilst a whole\narmy of men trod in over me to the attack.\n\nWhat had happened was clear to me now, though I was powerless to do\nanything in hindrance. The rebels with more craft than any one had\ncredited to them, had driven a galley from their camp under the ground,\nintending so to make an entrance into the heart of the city. In their\nclumsy ignorance, and having no one of sufficient talent in mensuration,\nthey had bungled sadly both in direction and length, and so had ended\ntheir burrow under this chamber of the captain of the gate. The great\nflagstone in its fall had, it appeared, crushed four of them to death,\nbut these were little noticed or lamented. Life was to them a bauble of\nthe slenderest price, and a horde of others pressed through the opening,\nlusting for the fight, and recking nothing of their risks and perils.\n\nHalf-choked by the foul air of the galley, and trodden on by this great\nprocession of feet, it was little enough I could do to help my immediate\nself much less the more distant city. But when the chief mass of the\nattackers had passed through, and there came only here and there one\neager to take his share at storming the gate, a couple of fellows\nplucked me up out of the mud on the floor, and began dragging me down\nthrough the stinking darkness of the galley towards the pit that gave it\nentrance.\n\nTwenty times we were jostled by others hastening to the attack, either\nfrom hunger for fight, or from appetite for what they could steal.\nBut we came to the open at last, and half-suffocated though I was, I\ncontrived to do obeisance, and say aloud the prescribed prayer to the\nmost High Gods in gratitude for the fresh, sweet air which They had\nprovided.\n\nOur Lord the Sun was on the verge of rising for His day, and all things\nwere plainly shown. Before me were the monstrous walls of the capital,\nwith the heads of its pyramids and higher buildings showing above them.\nAnd on the walls, the sentries walked calmly their appointed paces, or\ntook shelter against arrows in the casemates provided for them.\n\nThe din of fighting within the gate rose high into the air, and the\nheavy roaring of the cave-tigers told that they too were taking their\nshare of the melee. But the massive stonework of the walls hid all the\nactual engagement from our view, and which party was getting the upper\nhand we could not even guess. But the sounds told how tight a fight was\nbeing hammered out in those narrow boundaries, and my veins tingled to\nbe once more back at the old trade, and to be doing my share.\n\nBut there was no chivalry about the fellows who held me by my bonds.\nThey thrust me into a small temple near by, which once had been a fane\nin much favour with travellers, who wished to show gratitude for the\nsafe journey to the capital, but which now was robbed and ruined, and\nthey swung to the stone entrance gate and barred it, leaving me to\ncommune with myself. Presently, they told me, I should be put to death\nby torments. Well, this seemed to be the new custom of Atlantis, and I\nshould have to endure it as best I could. The High Gods, it appeared,\nhad no further use for my services in Atlantis, and I was not in the\nmood then to bite very much at their decision. What I had seen of the\ncountry since my return had not enamoured me very much with its new\nconditions.\n\nThe little temple in which I was gaoled had been robbed and despoiled of\nall its furnishments. But the light-slits, where at certain hours of the\nday the rays of our Lord the Sun had fallen upon the image of the God,\nbefore this had been taken away, gave me vantage places from which I\ncould see over the camp of these rebel besiegers, and a dreary prospect\nit was. The people seemed to have shucked off the culture of centuries\nin as many months, and to have gone back for the most part to sheer\nbrutishness. The majority harboured on the bare ground. Few owned\nshelter, and these were merely bowers of mud and branches.\n\nThey fought and quarrelled amongst themselves for food, eating their\nmeat raw, and their grain (when they had it) unground. Many who passed\nmy vision I saw were even gnawing the soft inside of tree bark.\n\nThe dead lay where they fell. The sick and the wounded found no hand\nto tend them. Great man-eating birds hovered about the camp or skulked\nabout, heavy with gorging, amongst the hovels, and no one had public\nspirit enough to give them battle. The stink of the place rose up to\nheaven as a foul incense inviting a pestilence. There was no order, no\ntrace of strong command anywhere. With three hundred well-disciplined\ntroops it seemed to me that I could have sent those poor desperate\nhordes flying in panic to the forest.\n\nHowever, there was no very lengthy space of time granted me for thinking\nout the policy of this matter to any great depth. The attack on the gate\nhad been delivered with suddenness; the repulse was not slow. Of what\ndesperate fighting took place in the galleries, and in the circus\nbetween the two sets of gates, the detail will never be told in full.\n\nAt the first alarm the great cave-tigers were set loose, and these raged\nimpartially against keeper and foe. Of those that went in through the\ntunnel, not one in ten returned, and there were few of these but what\ncarried a bloody wound. Some, with the ruling passion still strong in\nthem, bore back plunder; one trailed along with him the head of the\ncaptain of the gate; and amongst them they dragged out two of the\nwarders who were wounded, and whom revenge had urged them to take as\nprisoners.\n\nOver these two last a hubbub now arose, that seemed likely to boil over\ninto blows. Every voice shouted out for them what he thought the most\nrepulsive fate. Some were for burning, some for skinning, some for\nimpaling, some for other things: my flesh crept as I heard their\nravenous yells. Those that had been to the trouble of making them\ncaptive were still breathless from the fight, and were readily thrust\naside; and it seemed to me that the poor wretches would be hustled into\ndeath before any definite fate was agreed upon, which all would pass as\nsufficiently terrific. Never had I seen such a disorderly tumult, never\nsuch a leaderless mob. But, as always has happened, and always will, the\nstronger men by dint of louder voices and more vigorous shoulders got\ntheir plans agreed to at last, and the others perforce had to give way.\n\nA band of them set off running, and presently returned at snails' pace,\ndragging with them (with many squeals from ungreased wheels) one of\nthose huge war engines with which besiegers are wont to throw great\nstones and other missiles into the cities they sit down against. They\nran it up just beyond bowshot of the walls, and clamped it firmly down\nwith stakes and ropes to the earth. Then setting their lean arms to the\nwindlasses, they drew back the great tree which formed the spring till\nits tethering place reached the ground, and in the cradle at its head\nthey placed one of the prisoners, bound helplessly, so that he could not\nthrow himself over the side.\n\nThen the rude, savage, skin-clad mob stood back, and one who had\nappointed himself engineer knocked back the catch that held the great\nspring in place.\n\nWith a whir and a twang the elastic wood flung upwards, and the bound\nman was shot away from its tip with the speed of a lightning flash.\nHe sang through the air, spinning over and over with inconceivable\nrapidity, and the great crowd of rebels held their breath in silence as\nthey watched. He passed high above the city wall, a tiny mannikin in the\ndistance now, and then the trajectory of his flight began to lower. The\nspike of a new-built pyramid lay in the path of his terrific flight, and\nhe struck it with a thud whose sound floated out to us afterwards,\nand then he toppled down out of our sight, leaving a red stain on the\nwhiteness of the stone as he fell.\n\nWith a roar the crowd acknowledged the success of their device, and\nbellowed out insults to Phorenice, and insults to the Gods: a poor\nfrantic crowd they showed themselves. And then with ravening shouts,\nthey fell upon the other captive warder, binding him also into a compact\nhelpless missile, and meanwhile getting the engine in gear again for\nanother shot.\n\nBut for my part I saw nothing of this disgusting scene. I heard the bolt\ngrate stealthily against the door of the little temple in which I was\nimprisoned, and was minded to give these brutish rebels somewhat of a\nsurprise. I had rid myself of my bonds handily enough; I had rubbed\nmy limbs to that perfect suppleness which is always desirable before a\nfight; and I had planned to rush out so soon as the door was swung, and\nkill those that came first with fist blows on the brow and chin.\n\nThey had not suspected my name, it was clear, for my stature and garb\nwere nothing out of the ordinary; but if my bodily strength and fighting\npower had been sufficient to raise me to a vice-royalty like that of\nYucatan, and let me endure alive in that government throughout twenty\nhard-battling years, why, it was likely that this rabble of savages\nwould see something that was new and admirable in the practice of arms\nbefore the crude weight of their numbers could drag me down. Nay, I did\nnot even despair of winning free altogether. I must find me a weapon\nfrom those that came up to battle, with which I could write worthy\nsignatures, and I must attempt no standing fights. Gods! but what a glow\nthe prospect did send through me as I stood there waiting.\n\nA vainer man, writing history, might have said that always, before\neverything else, he held in mind the greater interests before the less.\nBut for me--I prefer to be honest, and own myself human. In my glee\nat that forthcoming fight--which promised to be the greatest and most\nfurious I had known in all a long life of battling--I will confess that\nAtlantis and her differing policies were clean forgot. I should go out\nan unknown man from the little cell of a temple, I should do my work,\nand then, whether I took freedom with me, or whether I came down at last\nmyself on a pile of slain, these people would guess without being told\nthe name, that here was Deucalion. Gods! what a fight we would have\nmade!\n\nBut the door did not open wide to give me space for my first rush. It\ncreaked gratingly outwards on its pivots, and a slim hand and a white\narm slipped inside, beckoning me to quietude. Here was some woman. The\ndoor creaked wider, and she came inside.\n\n\"Nais,\" I said.\n\n\"Silence, or they will hear you, and remember. At present those who\nbrought you here are killed, and unless by chance some one blunders into\nthis robbed shrine, you will not be found.\"\n\n\"Then, if that is so, let me go out and walk amongst these people as one\nof themselves.\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"But, Nais, I am not known here. I am merely a man in very plain and\nmud-stained robe. I should be in no ways remarkable.\"\n\nA smile twitched her face. \"My lord,\" she said, \"wears no beard; and his\nis the only clean chin in the camp.\"\n\nI joined in her laugh. \"A pest on my want of foppishness then. But I am\nforgetting somewhat. It comes to my mind that we still have unfinished\nthat small discussion of ours concerning the length of my poor life.\nHave you decided to cut it off from risk of further mischief, or do you\npropose to give me further span?\"\n\nShe turned to me with a look of sharp distress. \"My lord,\" she said,\n\"I would have you forget that silly talk of mine. This last two hours I\nthought you were dead in real truth.\"\n\n\"And you were not relieved?\"\n\n\"I felt that the only man was gone out of the world--I mean, my lord,\nthe only man who can save Atlantis.\"\n\n\"Your words give me a confidence. Then you would have me go back and\nbecome husband to Phorenice?\"\n\n\"If there is no other way.\"\n\n\"I warn you I shall do that, if she still so desires it, and if it seems\nto me that that course will be best. This is no hour for private likings\nor dislikings.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" she said, \"I feel it. I have no heart now, save only for\nAtlantis. I have schooled myself once more to that.\"\n\n\"And at present I am in this lone little box of a temple. A minute\nago, before you came, I had promised myself a pretty enough fight to\nsignalise my changing of abode.\"\n\n\"There must be nothing of that. I will not have these poor people\nslaughtered unnecessarily. Nor do I wish to see my lord exposed to a\nhopeless risk. This poor place, such as it is, has been given to me\nas an abode, and, if my lord can remain decorously till nightfall in a\nmaiden's chamber, he may at least be sure of quietude. I am a person,\"\nshe added simply, \"that in this camp has some respect. When darkness\ncomes, I will take my lord down to the sea and a boat, and so he may\ncome with ease to the harbour and the watergate.\"\n\n\n\n\n8. THE PREACHER FROM THE MOUNTAINS\n\n\nIt was long enough since I had found leisure for a parcel of sleep,\nand so during the larger part of that day I am free to confess that I\nslumbered soundly, Nais watching me. Night fell, and still we remained\nwithin the privacy of the temple. It was our plan that I should stay\nthere till the camp slept, and so I should have more chance of reaching\nthe sea without disturbance.\n\nThe night came down wet, with a drizzle of rain, and through the slits\nin the temple walls we could see the many fires in the camp well cared\nfor, the men and women in skins and rags toasting before them, with\nsteam rising as the heat fought with their wetness. Folk seated in\ndiscomfort like this are proverbially alert and cruel in the temper, and\nNais frowned as she looked on the inclemency of the weather.\n\n\"A fine night,\" she said, \"and I would have sent my lord back to the\ncity without a soul here being the wiser; but in this chill, people\nsleep sourly. We must wait till the hour drugs them sounder.\"\n\nAnd so we waited, sitting there together on that pavement so long\nunkissed by worshippers, and it was little enough we said aloud. But\nthere can be good companionship without sentences of talk.\n\nBut as the hours drew on, the night began to grow less quiet. From the\ndistance some one began to blow on a horn or a shell, sending forth a\nharsh raucous note incessantly. The sound came nearer, as we could tell\nfrom its growing loudness, and the voices of those by the fires made\nthemselves heard, railing at the blower for his disturbance. And\npresently it became stationary, and standing up we could see through the\nslits in the walls the people of the camp rousing up from their uneasy\nrest, and clustering together round one who stood and talked to them\nfrom the pedestal of a war engine.\n\nWhat he was declaiming upon we could not hear, and our curiosity on\nthe matter was not keen. Given that all who did not sleep went to weary\nthemselves with this fellow, as Nais whispered, it would be simple for\nme to make an exit in the opposite direction.\n\nBut here we were reckoning without the inevitable busybody. A dozen\npairs of feet splashing through the wet came up to the side of the\nlittle temple, and cried loudly that Nais should join the audience. She\nhad eloquence of tongue, it appeared, and they feared lest this speaker\nwho had taken his stand on the war engine should make schisms amongst\ntheir ranks unless some skilled person stood up also to refute his\narguments.\n\nHere, then, it seemed to me that I must be elbowed into my skirmish by\nthe most unexpected of chances, but Nais was firmly minded that there\nshould be no fight, if courage on her part could turn it. \"Come out with\nme,\" she whispered, \"and keep distant from the light of the fires.\"\n\n\"But how explain my being here?\"\n\n\"There is no reason to explain anything,\" she said bitterly. \"They will\ntake you for my lover. There is nothing remarkable in that: it is the\nmode here. But oh, why did not the Gods make you wear a beard, and curl\nit, even as other men? Then you could have been gone and safe these two\nhours.\"\n\n\"A smooth chin pleases me better.\"\n\n\"So it does me,\" I heard her murmur as she leaned her weight on the\nstone which hung in the doorway, and pushed it ajar; \"your chin.\" The\nragged men outside--there were women with them also--did not wait to\nwatch me very closely. A coarse jest or two flew (which I could have\nfound good heart to have repaid with a sword-thrust) and they stepped\noff into the darkness, just turning from time to time to make sure we\nfollowed. On all sides others were pressing in the same direction--black\nshadows against the night; the rain spat noisily on the camp fires as we\npassed them; and from behind us came up others. There were no sleepers\nin the camp now; all were pressing on to hear this preacher who stood on\nthe pedestal of the war engine; and if we had tried to swerve from the\nstraight course, we should have been marked at once.\n\nSo we held on through the darkness, and presently came within earshot.\n\nStill it was little enough of the preacher's words we could make out at\nfirst. \"Who are your chiefs?\" came the question at the end of a fervid\nharangue, and immediately all further rational talk was drowned in\nuproar. \"We have no chiefs,\" the people shouted, \"we are done with\nchiefs; we are all equal here. Take away your silly magic. You may kill\nus with magic if you choose, but rule us you shall not. Nor shall\nthe other priests rule. Nor Phorenice. Nor anybody. We are done with\nrulers.\"\n\nThe press had brought us closer and closer to the man who stood on the\nwar engine. We saw him to be old, with white hair that tumbled on his\nshoulders, and a long white beard, untrimmed and uncurled. Save for a\nwisp of rag about the loins, his body was unclothed, and glistened in\nthe wet.\n\nBut in his hand he held that which marked his caste. With it he pointed\nhis sentences, and at times he whirled it about bathing his wet,\nnaked body in a halo of light. It was a wand whose tip burned with an\nunconsuming fire, which glowed and twinkled and blazed like some star\nsent down by the Gods from their own place in the high heaven. It was\nthe Symbol of our Lord the Sun, a credential no one could forge, and one\non which no civilised man would cast a doubt.\n\nIndeed, the ragged frantic crew did not question for one moment that\nhe was a member of the Clan of Priests, the Clan which from time out\nof numbering had given rulers for the land, and even in their loudest\nclamours they freely acknowledged his powers. \"You may kill us with your\nmagic, if you choose,\" they screamed at him. But stubbornly they refused\nto come back to their old allegiance. \"We have suffered too many\nthings these later years,\" they cried. \"We are done with rulers now for\nalways.\"\n\nBut for myself I saw the old man with a different emotion. Here was\nZaemon that was father to Nais, Zaemon that had seen me yesterday seated\non the divan at Phorenice's elbow, and who to-day could denounce me as\nDeucalion if so he chose. These rebels had expended a navy in their\nwish to kill me four days earlier, and if they knew of my nearness, even\nthough Nais were my advocate, her cold reasoning would have had little\nchance of an audience now. The High Gods who keep the tether of our\nlives hide Their secrets well, but I did not think it impious to be sure\nthat mine was very near the cutting then.\n\nThe beautiful woman saw this too. She even went so far as to twine her\nfingers in mine and press them as a farewell, and I pressed hers in\nreturn, for I was sorry enough not to see her more. Still I could not\nhelp letting my thoughts travel with a grim gloating over the fine mound\nof dead I should build before these ragged, unskilled rebels pulled me\ndown. And it was inevitable this should be so. For of all the emotions\nthat can ferment in the human heart, the joy of strife is keenest, and\nnone but an old fighter, face to face with what must necessarily be his\nfinal battle, can tell how deep this lust is embroidered into the very\nfoundations of his being.\n\nBut for the time Zaemon did not see me, being too much wrapped in his\noutcry, and so I was free to listen to the burning words which he spread\naround him, and to determine their effect on the hearers.\n\nThe theme he preached was no new one. He told that ever since the\nbeginning of history, the Gods had set apart one Clan of the people\nto rule over the rest and be their Priests, and until the coming of\nPhorenice these had done their duties with exactitude and justice.\nThey had fought invaders, carried war against the beasts, and studied\nearth-movements so that they were able to foretell earthquakes and\neruptions, and could spread warnings that the people might be able\nto escape their devastations. They are no self-seekers; their aim was\nalways to further the interest of Atlantis, and so do honour to the\nkingdom on which the High Gods had set their special favour. Under the\nPriestly Clan, Atlantis had reached the pinnacle of human prosperity and\nhappiness.\n\n\"But,\" cried the old man, waving the Symbol till his wet body glistened\nin a halo of light, \"the people grew fat and careless with their easy\nlife. They began to have a conceit that their good fortune was earned\nby their own puny brains and thews, and was no gift from the Gods above;\nand presently the cult of these Gods became neglected, and Their temples\nwere barren of gifts and worshippers. Followed a punishment. The Gods\nin Their inscrutable way decreed that a wife of one of the Priests (that\nwas a governor of no inconsiderable province) should see a woman child\nby the wayside, and take it for adoption. That child the Gods in their\ninfinite wisdom fashioned into a scourge for Atlantis, and you who have\nfelt the weight of Phorenice's hand, know with what completeness the\nHigh Gods can fashion their instruments.\n\n\"Yet, even as they set up, so can they throw down, and those that\nshall debase Phorenice are even now appointed. The old rule is to\nbe re-established; but not till you who have sinned are sufficiently\nchastened to cry to it for relief.\" He waved the mysterious glowing\nSymbol before him. \"See,\" he cried in his high old quavering voice, \"you\nknow the unspeakable Power of which that is the sign, and for which I\nam the mouthpiece. It is for you to make decision now. Are the Gods to\nthrow down this woman who has scorned Them and so cruelly trodden on\nyou? Or are you to be still further purged of your pride before you are\nripe for deliverance?\"\n\nThe old priest broke off with a gesture, and his ragged white beard\nsank on to his chest. Promptly a young man, skin clad and carrying his\nweapon, elbowed up through the press of listeners, and jumped on to the\nplatform beside him. \"Hear me, brethren!\" he bellowed, in his strong\nyoung voice. \"We are done with tyrants. Death may come, and we all of us\nhere have shown how little we fear it. But own rulers again we will not,\nand that is our final say. My lord,\" he said, turning to the old man\nwith a brave face, \"I know it is in your power to kill me by magic if\nyou choose, but I have said my say, and can stand the cost if needs be.\"\n\n\"I can kill you, but I will not,\" said Zaemon. \"You have said your\nsilliness. Now go you to the ground again.\"\n\n\"We have free speech here. I will not go till I choose.\"\n\n\"Aye, but you will,\" said the old man, and turned on him with a sudden\ntightening of the brows. There was no blow passed; even the Symbol,\nwhich glowed like a star against the night, was not so much as lifted in\nwarning; but the young man tried to retort, and, finding himself smitten\nwith a sudden dumbness, turned with a spasm of fear, and jumped back\nwhence he had come. The crowd of them thrilled expectantly, and when no\nfurther portent was given, they began to shout that a miracle should be\nshown them, and then perchance they would be persuaded back to the old\nallegiance.\n\nThe old man stooped and glowered at them in fury. \"You dogs,\" he cried,\n\"you empty-witted dogs! Do you ask that I should degrade the powers of\nthe Higher Mysteries by dancing them out before you as though they were\na mummers' show? Do you tickle yourselves that you are to be tempted\nback to your allegiance? It is for you to woo the Gods who are so\noffended. Come in humility, and I take it upon myself to declare that\nyou will receive fitting pardon and relief. Remain stubborn, and the\nscourge, Phorenice, may torment you into annihilation before she in turn\nis made to answer for the evil she has put upon the land. There is the\nchoice for you to pick at.\"\n\nThe turmoil of voices rose again into the wetness of the night, and\nweapons were upraised menacingly. It was clear that the party for\nindependence had by far the greater weight, both in numbers and\nlustiness; and those who might, from sheer weariness of strife, have\nbeen willing for surrender, withheld their word through terror of the\nconsequence. It was a fine comment on the freedom of speech, about which\nthese unruly fools had made their boast, and, with a sly malice, I could\nnot help whispering a word on this to Nais as she stood at my elbow. But\nNais clutched at my hand, and implored me for caution. \"Oh, be silent,\nmy lord,\" she whispered back, \"or they will tear you in pieces. They are\non fire for mischief now.\"\n\n\"Yet a few hours back you were for killing me yourself,\" I could not\nhelp reminding her.\n\nShe turned on me with a hot look. \"A woman can change her mind, my lord.\nBut it becomes you little to remind her of her fickleness.\"\n\nA man in the press beside me wrenched round with an effort, and stared\nat me searchingly through the darkness. \"Oh!\" he said. \"A shaved chin.\nWho are you, friend, that you should cut a beard instead of curling it?\nI can see no wound on your face.\"\n\nI answered him civilly enough that, with \"freedom\" for a watchword, the\nfashion of my chin was a matter of mere private concern. But as that did\nnot satisfy him, and as he seemed to be one of those quarrelsome fellows\nthat are the bane of every community, I took him suddenly by the throat\nand the shoulder, and bent his neck with the old, quick turn till I\nheard it crack, and had unhanded him before any of his neighbours had\nseen what had befallen. The fierce press of the crowd held him from\nslipping to the ground, and so he stood on there where he was, with his\nhead nodded forward, as though he had fallen asleep through heaviness,\nor had fainted through the crushing of his fellows. I had no desire to\nbegin that last fight of mine in a place like this, where there was no\nroom to swing a weapon, nor chance to clear a battle ring.\n\nBut all this time the lean preacher from the mountains was sending forth\nhis angry anathemas, and still holding the strained attention of the\npeople. And next he set forth before them the cult of the Gods in the\nancient form as is prescribed, and they (with old habit coming back to\nthem) made response in the words and in the places where the old ritual\nenjoins. It was weird enough sight, that time-honoured service of\nadoration, forced upon these wild people after so long a period of\nirreligion.\n\nThey warmed to the old words as the high shrill voice of the priest\ncried them forth, and as they listened, and as they realised how\nintimate was the care of the Gods for the travails and sorrows of their\ndaily lives, so much warmer grew their responses.\n\n\"... WHO STILLED THE BURNING OF THE MOUNTAINS, AND MADE COOL PLACES ON\nTHE EARTH FOR US TO LIVE!--PRAISE TO THE MOST HIGH GODS.\n\n\"WHO GAVE US MASTERY OVER THE LESSER BEASTS AND SKILL OF TEN TIMES TO\nPREVAIL!--PRAISE TO THE MOST HIGH GODS....\"\n\n\"WHO GAVE US MASTERY OVER THE LESSER BEASTS AND SKILL OF TEN TIMES TO\nPREVAIL!--PRAISE TO THE MOST HIGH GODS....\"\n\nIt thrilled one to hear their earnestness; it sorrowed one to know that\nthey would yet be obdurate and not return to their old allegiance.\nFor this is the way with these common people; they will work up an\nenthusiasm one minute, and an hour later it will have fled away and left\nthem cold and empty.\n\nBut Zaemon made no further calls upon their loyalty. He finished the\nprescribed form of sentences, and stepped down off the platform of the\nwar engine with the Symbol of our Lord the Sun thrust out resolutely\nbefore him. To all ordinary seeming the crowd had been packed so that no\nfurther compression was possible, but before the advance of the Symbol\nthe people crushed back, leaving a wide lane for his passage.\n\nAnd here came the turning point of my life. At first, like, I take\nit, every one else in that crowd, I imagined that the old man, having\nfinished his mission, was making a way to return to the place from which\nhe had come. But he held steadily to one direction, and as that was\ntowards myself, it naturally came to my mind that, having dealt with\ngreater things, he would now settle with the less; or, in plainer words,\nthat having put his policy before the swarming people, he would now\nsmite down the man he had seen but yesterday seated as Phorenice's\nminister. Well, I should lose that final fight I had promised myself,\nand that mound of slain for my funeral bed. It was clear that Zaemon was\nthe mouthpiece of the Priests' Clan, duly appointed; and I also was a\npriest. If the word had been given on the Sacred Mountain to those who\nsat before the Ark of the Mysteries that Atlantis would prosper more\nwith Deucalion sent to the Gods, I was ready to bow to the sentence with\nsubmissiveness. That I had regret for this mode of cutting off, I will\nnot deny. No man who has practised the game of arms could abandon the\npromise of such a gorgeous final battle without a qualm of longing.\n\nBut I had been trained enough to show none of these emotions on my face,\nand when the old man came up to me, I stood my ground and gave him the\nsalutation prescribed between our ranks, which he returned to me with\ncircumstance and accuracy. The crowd fell back, being driven away by the\nineffable force of the Symbol, leaving us alone in the middle of a\nring. Even Nais, though she was a priest's daughter, was ignorant of the\nMysteries, and could not withstand its force. And so we two men stood\nthere alone together, with the glow of the Symbol bathing us, and\nlighting up the sea of ravenous faces that watched.\n\nThe people were quick to put their natural explanation on the scene. \"A\nspy!\" they began to roar out. \"A spy! Zaemon salutes him as a Priest!\"\n\nZaemon faced round on them with a queer look on his grim old face.\n\"Aye,\" he said, \"this is a Priest. If I give you his name, you might\nhave further interest. This is the Lord Deucalion.\"\n\nThe word was picked up and yelled amongst them with a thousand emotions.\nBut at least they were loyal to their policy; they had decided that\nDeucalion was their enemy; they had already expended a navy for his\ndestruction; and now that he was ringed in by their masses, they lusted\nto tear him into rags with their fingers. But rave and rave though they\nmight against me, the glare from the Symbol drove them shuddering back\nas though it had been a lava-stream; and Zaemon was not the man to hand\nme over to their fury until he had delivered formal sentence as the\nemissary of our Clan on the Sacred Mount. So the end was not to be yet.\n\nThe old man faced me and spoke in the sacred tongue, which the common\npeople do not know. \"My brother,\" he said, \"which have you come to\nserve, Deucalion or Atlantis?\"\n\n\"Words are a poor thing to answer a question like that. You will know\nall of my record. According to the Law of the Priests, each ship from\nYucatan will have carried home its sworn report to lay at the feet of\ntheir council, and before I went to that vice-royalty, what I did was\nwritten plain here on the face of Atlantis.\"\n\n\"We know your doings in the past, brother, and they have found approval.\nYou have governed well, and you have lived austerely. You set up\nAtlantis for a mistress, and served her well; but then, you have had no\nPhorenice to tempt you into change and fickleness.\"\n\n\"You can send me where I shall see her no more, if you think me frail.\"\n\n\"Yes, and lose your usefulness. No, brother, you are the last hope which\nthis poor land has remaining. All other human means that have been tried\nagainst Phorenice have failed. You have returned from overseas for the\nfinal duel. You are the strongest man we have, and you are our final\nchampion. If you fail, then only those terrible Powers which are locked\nwithin the Ark of the Mysteries remains to us, and though it is not\nlawful to speak even in this hidden tongue of their scope, you at least\nhave full assurance of their potency.\"\n\nI shrugged my shoulders. \"It seems that you would save time and pains\nif you threw me to these wolves of rebels, and let them end me here and\nnow.\"\n\nThe old man frowned on me angrily. \"I am bidding you do your duty. What\nreason have you for wishing to evade it?\"\n\n\"I have in my memory the words you spoke in the pyramid, when you came\nin amongst the banqueters. 'PHORENICE,' was your cry, 'WHILST YOU ARE\nYET EMPRESS, YOU SHALL SEE THIS ROYAL PYRAMID, WHICH YOU HAVE POLLUTED\nWITH YOUR DEBAUCHERIES, TORN TIER FROM TIER, AND STONE FROM STONE,\nAND SCATTERED AS FEATHERS BEFORE A WIND.' It seems that you foresee my\ndefeat.\"\n\nThe old man shuddered. \"I cannot tell what she may force us to do. I\nspoke then only what it was revealed to me must happen. Perhaps when\nmatters have reached that pass, she will repent and submit. But in the\nmeanwhile, before we use the more desperate weapons of the Gods, it is\nfitting that we should expend all human power remaining to us. And so\nyou must go, my brother, and play your part to the utmost.\"\n\n\"It is an order. So I obey.\"\n\n\"You shall be at Phorenice's side again by the next dawn. She has sent\nfor you from Yucatan as a husband, and as one who (so she thinks,\npoor human conqueror) has the weight of arm necessary to prolong her\ntyrannies. You are a Priest, brother, and you are a man of convincing\ntongue. It will be your part to make her stubborn mind see the\ninvincible power that can be loosed against her, to point out to her the\nutter hopelessness of prevailing against it.\"\n\n\"If it is ordered, I will do these things. But there is little enough\nchance of success. I have seen Phorenice, and can gauge her will. There\nwill be no turning her once she has made a decision. Others have tried;\nyou have tried yourself; all have failed.\"\n\n\"Words that were wasted on a maiden may go home to a wife. You have been\nbrought here to be her husband. Well, take your place.\"\n\nThe order came to me with a pang. I had given little enough heed to\nwomen through all of a busy life, though when I landed, the taking of\nPhorenice to wife would not have been very repugnant to me if policy had\ndemanded it. But the matters of the last two days had put things in a\ndifferent shape. I had seen two other women who had strangely attracted\nme, and one of these had stirred within me a tumult such as I had never\nfelt before amongst my economies.\n\nTo lead Phorenice in marriage would mean a severance from this other\nwoman eternally, and I ached as I thought of it. But though these\nthoughts floated through my system and gave me harsh wrenches of pain, I\ndid not thrust my puny likings before the command of the council of the\nPriests. I bowed before Zaemon, and put his hand to my forehead. \"It is\nan order,\" I said. \"If our Lord the Sun gives me life, I will obey.\"\n\n\"Then let us begone from this place,\" said Zaemon, and took me by the\narm and waved a way for us with the Symbol. No further word did I have\nwith Nais, fearing to embroil her with these rebels who clustered round,\nbut I caught one hot glance from her eyes, and that had to suffice\nfor farewell. The dense ranks of the crowd opened, and we walked\naway between them scathless. Fiercely though they lusted for my life,\nbrimming with hate though they made their cries, no man dared to rush\nin and raise a hand against me. Neither did they follow. When we reached\nthe outskirts of the crowd, and the ranks thinned, they had a mind, many\nof them, to surge along in our wake; but Zaemon whirled the Symbol back\nbefore their faces with a blaze of lurid light, and they fell to their\nknees, grovelling, and pressed on us no more.\n\nThe rain still fell, and in the light of the camp fires as we passed\nthem, the wet gleamed on the old man's wasted body. And far before us\nthrough the darkness loomed the vast bulk of the Sacred Mountain, with\nthe ring of eternal fires encincturing its crest. I sighed as I thought\nof the old peaceful days I had spent in its temple and groves.\n\nBut there was to be no more of that studious leisure now. There was work\nto be done, work for Atlantis which did not brook delay. And so when we\nhad progressed far out into the waste, and there was none near to view\n(save only the most High Gods), we found the place where the passage\nwas, whose entrance is known only to the Seven amongst the Priests; and\nthere we parted, Zaemon to his hermitage in the dangerous lands, and I\nby this secret way back into the capital.\n\n\n\n\n9. PHORENICE, GODDESS\n\n\nNow the passage, though its entrance had been cunningly hidden by man's\nartifice, was one of those veins in which the fiery blood of our mother,\nthe Earth, had aforetime coursed. Long years had passed since it carried\nlava streams, but the air in it was still warm and sulphurous, and there\nwas no inducement to linger in transit. I lit me a lamp which I found\nin an appointed niche, and walked briskly along my ways, coughing, and\nwishing heartily I had some of those simples which ease a throat that\nhas a tendency to catarrh. But, alas! all that packet of drugs which\nwere my sole spoil from the vice-royalty of Yucatan were lost in the\nsea-fight with Dason's navy, and since landing in Atlantis there had\nbeen little enough time to think for the refinements of medicine.\n\nThe network of earth-veins branched prodigiously, and if any but one of\nus Seven Priests had found a way into its recesses by chance, he would\nhave perished hopelessly in the windings, or have fallen into one of\nthose pits which lead to the boil below. But I carried the chart of the\ntrue course clearly in my head, remembering it from that old initiation\nof twenty years back, when, as an appointed viceroy, I was raised to the\nhighest degree but one known to our Clan, and was given its secrets and\nworking implements.\n\nThe way was long, the floor was monstrous uneven, and the air, as I have\nsaid, bad; and I knew that day would be far advanced before the signs\ntold me that I had passed beneath the walls, and was well within\nthe precincts of the city. And here the vow of the Seven hampered my\nprogress; for it is ordained that under no circumstances, whatever the\nstress, shall egress be made from this passage before mortal eye. One\nbranch after another did I try, but always found loiterers near the\nexits. I had hoped to make my emergence by that path which came inside\nthe royal pyramid. But there was no chance of coming up unobserved here;\nthe place was humming like a hive. And so, too, with each of the\nfive next outlets that I visited. The city was agog with some strange\nexcitement.\n\nBut I came at last to a temple of one of the lesser Gods, and stood\nbehind the image for a while making observation. The place was empty;\nnay, from the dust which robed all the floors and the seats of the\nworshippers, it had been empty long enough; so I moved all that was\nneedful, stepped out, and closed all entry behind me. A broom lay\nunnoticed on one of the pews, and with this I soon disguised all route\nof footmark, and took my way to the temple door. It was shut, and priest\nthough I was, the secret of its opening was beyond me.\n\nHere was a pretty pass. No one but the attendant priests of the temple\ncould move the mechanism which closed and opened the massive stone which\nfilled the doorway; and if all had gone out to attend this spectacle,\nwhatever it might be, that was stirring the city, why there I should be\nno nearer enlargement than before.\n\nThere was no sound of life within the temple precincts; there were\nevidences of decay and disuse spread broadcast on every hand; but\naccording to the ancient law there should be eternally one at least on\nwatch in the priests' dwellings, so down the passages which led to them\nI made my way. It would have surprised me little to have found even\nthese deserted. That the old order was changed I knew, but I was only\nthen beginning to realise the ruthlessness with which it had been swept\naway, and how much it had given place to the new.\n\nHowever, there can be some faithful men remaining even in an age of\ngeneral apostasy, and on making my way to the door of the dwelling\n(which lay in the roof of the temple) I gave the call, and presently it\nwas opened to me. The man who stood before me, peering dully through\nthe gloom, had at least remained constant to his vows, and I made the\nsalutation before him with a feeling of respect.\n\nHis name was Ro, and I remembered him well. We had passed through the\nsacred college together, and always he had been known as the dullard.\nHe had capacity for learning little of the cult of the Gods, less of\nthe arts of ruling, less still of the handling of arms; and he had been\nappointed to some lowly office in this obscure temple, and had risen to\nbeing its second priest and one of its two custodians merely through the\ndesertion of all his colleagues. But it was not pleasant to think that a\nfool should remain true where cleverer men abandoned the old beliefs.\n\nRo did before me the greater obeisance. He wore his beard curled in the\nprevailing fashion, but it was badly done. His clothing was ill-fitting\nand unbrushed. He always had been a slovenly fellow. \"The temple door\nis shut,\" he said, \"and I only have the secret of its opening. My lord\ncomes here, therefore, by the secret way, and as one of the Seven. I am\nmy lord's servant.\"\n\n\"Then I ask this small service of you. Tell me, what stirs the city?\"\n\n\"That impious Phorenice has declared herself Goddess, and declares that\nshe will light the sacrifice with her own divine fire. She will do it,\ntoo. She does everything. But I wish the flames may burn her when she\ncalls them down. This new Empress is the bane of our Clan, Deucalion,\nthese latter days. The people neglect us; they bring no offerings; and\nnow, since these rebels have been hammering at the walls, I might have\ngone hungry if I had not some small store of my own. Oh, I tell you, the\ncult of the true Gods is well-nigh oozed quite out of the land.\"\n\n\"My brother, it comes to my mind that the Priests of our Clan have been\nlimp in their service to let these things come to pass.\"\n\n\"I suppose we have done our best. At least, we did as we were taught.\nBut if the people will not come to hear your exhortations, and neglect\nto adore the God, what hold have you over their religion? But I tell\nyou, Deucalion, that the High Gods try our own faith hard. Come into the\ndwelling here. Look there on my bed.\"\n\nI saw the shape of a man, untidily swathed in reddened bandages.\n\n\"This is all that is left of the poor priest that was my immediate\nsuperior in this cure. It was his turn yesterday to celebrate the weekly\nsacrifice to our Lord the Sun with the circle of His great stones.\nFaugh! Deucalion, you should have seen how he was mangled when they\nbrought him back to me here.\"\n\n\"Did the people rise on him? Has it come to that?\"\n\n\"The people stayed passive,\" said Ro bitterly, \"what few of them had\ninterest to attend; but our Lord the Sun saw fit to try His minister\nsomewhat harshly. The wood was laid; the sacrifice was disposed upon it\naccording to the prescribed rites; the procession had been formed round\nthe altar, and the drums and the trumpets were speaking forth, to let\nall men know that presently the smoke of their prayer would be wafted\nup towards Those that sit in the great places in the heavens. But then,\nabove the noise of the ceremonial, there came the rushing sound of\nwings, and from out of the sky there flew one of those great featherless\nman-eating birds, of a bigness such as seldom before has been seen.\"\n\n\"An arrow shot in the eye, or a long-shafted spear receives them best.\"\n\n\"Oh, all men know what they were taught as children, Deucalion; but\nthese priests were unarmed, according to the rubric, which ordains that\nthey shall intrust themselves completely to the guardianship of the\nHigh Gods during the hours of sacrifice. The great bird swooped down,\nsettling on the wood pyre, and attacked the sacrifice with beak and\ntalon. My poor superior here, still strong in his faith, called loudly\non our Lord the Sun to lend power to his arm, and sprang up on the altar\nwith naught but his teeth and his bare arms for weapons. It may be\nthat he expected a miracle--he has not spoke since, poor soul, in\nexplanation--but all he met were blows from leathery wings, and rakings\nfrom talons which went near to disembowelling him. The bird brushed him\naway as easily as we could sweep aside a fly, and there he lay bleeding\non the pavement beside the altar, whilst the sacrifice was torn and\neaten in the presence of all the people. And then, when the bird was\nglutted, it flew away again to the mountains.\"\n\n\"And the people gave no help?\"\n\n\"They cried out that the thing was a portent, that our Lord the Sun\nwas a God no longer if He had not power or thought to guard His own\nsacrifice; and some cried that there was no God remaining now, and\nothers would have it that there was a new God come to weigh on the\ncountry, which had chosen to take the form of a common man-eating bird.\nBut a few began to shout that Phorenice stood for all the Gods now in\nAtlantis, and that cry was taken up till the stones of the great\ncircle rang with it. Some may have made proclamations because they were\nconvinced; many because the cry was new, and pleased them; but I am sure\nthere were not a few who joined in because it was dangerous to leave\nsuch an outburst unwelcomed. The Empress can be hard enough to those who\nneglect to give her adulation.\"\n\n\"The Empress is Empress,\" I said formally, \"and her name carries\nrespect. It is not for us to question her doings.\"\n\n\"I am a priest,\" said Ro, \"and I speak as I have been taught, and defend\nthe Faith as I have been commanded. Whether there is a Faith any longer,\nI am beginning to doubt. But, anyway, it yields a poor enough livelihood\nnowadays. There have been no offerings at this temple this five months\npast, and if I had not a few jars of corn put by, I might have starved\nfor anything the pious of this city cared. And I do not think that the\naffair of that sacrifice is likely to put new enthusiasm into our cold\nvotaries.\"\n\n\"When did it happen?\"\n\n\"Twenty hours ago. To-day Phorenice conducts the sacrifice herself.\nThat has caused the stir you spoke about. The city is in the throes of\ngetting ready one of her pageants.\"\n\n\"Then I must ask you to open the temple doors and give me passage. I\nmust go and see this thing for myself.\"\n\n\"It is not for me to offer advice to one of the Seven,\" said Ro\ndoubtfully.\n\n\"It is not.\"\n\n\"But they say that the Empress is not overpleased at your absence,\" he\nmumbled. \"I should not like harm to come in your way, Deucalion,\" he\nsaid aloud.\n\n\"The future is in the hands of the most High Gods, Ro, and I at least\nbelieve that They will deal out our fates to each of us as They in Their\ninfinite wisdom see best, though you seem to have lost your faith. And\nnow I must be your debtor for a passage out through the doors. Plagues!\nman, it is no use your holding out your hand to me. I do not own a coin\nin all the world.\"\n\nHe mumbled something about \"force of habit\" as he led the way down\ntowards the door, and I responded tartly enough about the unpleasantness\nof his begging customs. \"If it were not for your sort and your customs,\nthe Priests' Clan would not be facing this crisis to-day.\"\n\n\"One must live,\" he grumbled, as he pressed his levers, and the massive\nstone in the doorway swung ajar.\n\n\"If you had been a more capable man, I might have seen the necessity,\"\nsaid I, and passed into the open and left him. I could never bring\nmyself to like Ro.\n\nA motley crowd filled the street which ran past the front of this\nobscure temple, and all were hurrying one way. With what I had been\ntold, it did not take much art to guess that the great stone circle of\nour Lord the Sun was their mark, and it grieved me to think of how many\nvenerable centuries that great fane had upreared before the weather and\nthe earth tremors, without such profanation as it would witness to-day.\nAnd also the thought occurred to me, \"Was our Great Lord above drawing\nthis woman on to her destruction? Would He take some vast and final act\nof vengeance when she consummated her final sacrilege?\"\n\nBut the crowd pressed on, thrilled and excited, and thinking little\n(as is a crowd's wont) on the deeper matters which lay beneath the bare\nspectacle. From one quarter of the city walls the din of an attack from\nthe besiegers made itself clearly heard from over the house, and the\ntemples and the palaces intervening, but no one heeded it. They had\ngrown callous, these townsfolk, to the battering of rams, and the flight\nof fire-darts, and the other emotions of a bombardment. Their nerves,\ntheir hunger, their desperation, were strung to such a pitch that little\nshort of an actual storm could stir them into new excitement over the\nsiege.\n\nAll were weaponed. The naked carried arms in the hopes of meeting some\none whom they could overcome and rob; those that had a possession walked\nready to do a battle for its ownership. There was no security, no trust;\nthe lesson of civilisation had dropped away from these common people as\nmud is washed from the feet by rain, and in their new habits and their\nthoughts they had gone back to the grade from which savages like those\nof Europe have never yet emerged. It was a grim commentary on the\nsuccess of Phorenice's rule.\n\nThe crowd merged me into their ranks without question, and with them I\npressed forward down the winding streets, once so clean and trim, now so\nfoul and mud-strewn. Men and women had died of hunger in these streets\nthese latter years, and rotted where they lay, and we trod their bones\nunderfoot as we walked. Yet rising out of this squalor and this misery\nwere great pyramids and palaces, the like of which for splendour and\nmagnificence had never been seen before. It was a jarring admixture.\n\nIn time we came to the open space in the centre of the city, which even\nPhorenice had not dared to encroach upon with her ambitious building\nschemes, and stood on the secular ground which surrounds the most\nancient, the most grand, and the breast of all this world's temples.\n\nSince the beginning of time, when man first emerged amongst the beasts,\nour Lord the Sun has always been his chiefest God, and legend says that\nHe raised this circle of stones Himself to be a place where votaries\nshould offer Him worship. It is the fashion amongst us moderns not to\ntake these old tales in a too literal sense, but for myself, this one\nsatisfies me. By our wits we can lift blocks weighing six hundred men,\nand set them as the capstones of our pyramids. But to uprear the stones\nof that great circle would be beyond all our art, and much more would\nit be impossible to-day, to transport them from their distant quarries\nacross the rugged mountains.\n\nThere were nine-and-forty of the stones, alternating with spaces, and\nset in an accurate circle, and across the tops of them other stones were\nset, equally huge. The stones were undressed and rugged; but the huge\nmassiveness of them impressed the eye more than all the temples and\ndaintily tooled pyramids of our wondrous city. And in the centre of the\ncircle was that still greater stone which formed the altar, and round\nwhich was carved, in the rude chiselling of the ancients, the snake and\nthe outstretched hand.\n\nThe crowd which bore me on came to a standstill before the circle of\nstones. To trespass beyond this is death for the common people; and for\nmyself, although I had the right of entrance, I chose to stay where I\nwas for the present, unnoticed amongst the mob, and wait upon events.\n\nFor long enough we stood there, our Lord the Sun burning high and\nfiercely from the clear blue sky above our heads. The din of the rebels'\nattack upon the walls came to us clearly, even above the gabble of the\nmultitude, but no one gave attention to it. Excitement about what was to\nbefall in the circle mastered every other emotion.\n\nI learned afterways that so pressing was the rebels' attack, and so\ndestructive the battering of their new war engines, that Phorenice had\ngone off to the walls first to lend awhile her brilliant skill for its\nrepulse, and to put heart into the defenders. But as it was, the day had\nburned out to its middle and scorched us intolerably, before the noise\nof the drums and horns gave advertisement that the pageant had formed in\nprocession; and of those who waited in the crowd, many had fainted with\nexhaustion and the heat, and not a few had died. But life was cheap in\nthe city of Atlantis now, and no one heeded the fallen.\n\nNearer and nearer drew the drums and the braying of the other music,\nand presently the head of a glittering procession began to arrive and\ndispose itself in the space which had been set apart. Many a thousand\npoor starving wretches sighed when they saw the wanton splendour of it.\nBut these lords and these courtiers of this new Atlantis had no concern\nbeyond their own bellies and their own backs, except for their one alien\nregard--their simpering affection for Phorenice.\n\nI think, though, their loyalty for the Empress was real enough, and\nit was not to be wondered at, since everything they had came from her\nlavish hands. Indeed, the woman had a charm that cannot be denied, for\nwhen she appeared, riding in the golden castle (where I also had ridden)\non the back of her monstrous shaggy mammoth, the starved sullen faces\nof the crowd brightened as though a meal and sudden prosperity had been\nbestowed upon them; and without a word of command, without a trace of\ncompulsion, they burst into spontaneous shouts of welcome.\n\nShe acknowledged it with a smile of thanks. Her cheeks were a little\nflushed, her movements quick, her manner high-strung, as all well\nmight be, seeing the horrible sacrilege she had in mind. But she was\nundeniably lovely; yes, more adorably beautiful than ever with her\npresent thrill of excitement; and when the stair was brought, and she\nwalked down from the mammoth's back to the ground, those near fell\nto their knees and gave her worship, out of sheer fascination for her\nbeauty and charm.\n\nYlga, the fan-girl, alone of all that vast multitude round the Sun\ntemple contained herself with her formal paces and duties. She looked\npained and troubled. It was plain to see, even from the distance where\nI stood, that she carried a heavy heart under the jewels of her robe.\nIt was fitting, too, that this should be so. Though she had been long\nenough divorced from his care and fostered by the Empress, Ylga was\na daughter of Zaemon, and he was the chiefest of our Lord the Sun's\nministers here on earth. She could not forget her upbringing now at\nthis supreme moment when the highest of the old Gods was to be formally\ndefied. And perhaps also (having a kindness for Phorenice) she was not a\nlittle dreadful of the consequences.\n\nBut the Empress had no eye for one sad look amongst all that sea of\nglowing faces. Boldly and proudly she strode out into the circle, as\nthough she had been the duly appointed priest for the sacrifice. And\nafter her came a knot of men, dressed as priests, and bearing the\nvictim. Some of these were creatures of her own, and it was easy to\nforgive mere ignorant laymen, won over by the glamour of Phorenice's\npresence. But some, to their shame, were men born in the Priests' Clan,\nand brought up in the groves and colleges of the Sacred Mountain, and\nfor their apostasy there could be no palliation.\n\nThe wood had already been stacked on the altar-stone in the due form\nrequired by the ancient symbolism, and the Empress stood aside whilst\nthose who followed did what was needful. As they opened out, I saw that\nthe victim was one of the small, cloven-hoofed horses that roam the\nplains--a most acceptable sacrifice. They bound its feet with metal\ngyves, and put it on the pyre, where, for a while, it lay neighing. Then\nthey stepped aside, and left it living. Here was an innovation.\n\nThe false priests went back to the farther side of the circle, and\nPhorenice stood alone before the altar. She lifted up her voice, sweet,\ntuneful, and carrying, and though the din of the siege still came from\nover the city, no ear there lost a word of what was spoken.\n\nShe raised her glance aloft, and all other eyes followed it. The heaven\nwas clear as the deep sea, a gorgeous blue. But as the words came from\nher, so a small mist was born in the sky, wheeling and circling like a\nball, although the day was windless, and rapidly growing darker and more\ncompact. So dense had it become, that presently it threw a shadow on\npart of the sacred circle and soothed it into twilight, though all\nwithout where the people stood was still garish day. And in the ball of\nmist were little quick stabs and splashes of noiseless flame.\n\nShe spoke, not in the priests' sacred tongue--though such was her wicked\ncleverness, that she may very well have learned it--but in the common\nspeech of the people, so that all who heard might understand; and she\ntold of her wondrous birth (as she chose to name it), and of the\ndirect aid of the most High Gods, which had enabled her to work so many\nmarvels. And in the end she lifted both of her fair white arms towards\nthe blackness above, and with her lovely face set with the strain of\nwill, she uttered her final cry:\n\n\"O my high Father, the Sun, I pray You now to acknowledge me as Your\nvery daughter. Give this people a sign that I am indeed a child of the\nGods and no frail mortal. Here is sacrifice unlit, where mortal priests\nwith their puny fires had weekly, since the foundation of this land,\nsent savoury smoke towards the sky. I pray You send down the heavenly\nfire to burn this beast here offered, in token that though You still\nrule on high, You have given me Atlantis to be my kingdom, and the\npeople of the Earth to be my worshippers.\"\n\nShe broke off and strained towards the sky. Her face was contorted. Her\nlimbs shook. \"O mighty Father,\" she cried, \"who hast made me a God and\nan equal, hear me! Hear me!\"\n\nOut of the black cloud overhead there came a blinding flash of light,\nwhich spat downwards on to the altar. The cloven-hoofed horse gave one\nshrill neigh, and one convulsion, and fell back dead. Flames crackled\nout from the wood pile, and the air became rich with the smell of\nburning flesh. And lo! in another moment the cloud above had melted into\nnothingness, and the flames burnt pale, and the smoke went up in a thin\nblue spiral towards the deeper blueness of the sky.\n\nPhorenice, the Empress, stood there before the great stone, and before\nthe snake and the outstretched hand of life which were inscribed upon\nit, flushed, exultant, and once more radiantly lovely; and the knot of\npriests within the circle, and the great mob of people without, fell to\nthe ground adoring.\n\n\"Phorenice, Goddess!\" they cried. \"Phorenice, Goddess of all Atlantis!\"\n\nBut for myself I did not kneel. I would have no part in this apostasy,\nso I stood there awaiting fate.\n\n\n\n\n10. A WOOING\n\n\nA murmur quickly sprang up round me, which grew into shouts. \"Kneel,\"\none whispered, \"kneel, sir, or you will be seen.\" And another cried:\n\"Kneel, you without beard, and do obeisance to the only Goddess, or by\nthe old Gods I will make myself her priest and butcher you!\" And so the\nshouts arose into a roar.\n\nBut presently the word \"Deucalion\" began to be bandied about, and there\ncame a moderation in the zeal of these enthusiasts. Deucalion, the man\nwho had left Atlantis twenty years before to rule Yucatan, they might\nknow little enough about, but Deucalion, who rode not many days back\nbeside the Empress in the golden castle beneath the canopy of snakes,\nwas a person they remembered; and when they weighed up his possible\nability for vengeance, the shouts died away from them limply.\n\nSo when the silence had grown again, and Phorenice turned and saw me\nstanding alone amongst all the prostrate worshippers, I stepped out from\nthe crowd and passed between two of the great stones, and went across\nthe circle to where she stood beside the altar. I did not prostrate\nmyself. At the prescribed distance I made the salutation which she\nherself had ordered when she made me her chief minister, and then hailed\nher with formal decorum as Empress.\n\n\"Deucalion, man of ice,\" she retorted.\n\n\"I still adhere to the old Gods!\"\n\n\"I was not referring to that,\" said she, and looked at me with a\nsidelong smile.\n\nBut here Ylga came up to us with a face that was white, and a hand that\nshook, and made supplication for my life. \"If he will not leave the old\nGods yet,\" she pleaded, \"surely you will pardon him? He is a strong\nman, and does not become a convert easily. You may change him later. But\nthink, Phorenice, he is Deucalion; and if you slay him here for this\none thing, there is no other man within all the marches of Atlantis who\nwould so worthily serve--\"\n\nThe Empress took the words from her. \"You slut,\" she cried out. \"I have\nyou near me to appoint my wardrobe, and carry my fan, and do you dare\nto put a meddling finger on my policies? Back with you, outside this\ncircle, or I'll have you whipped. Ay, and I'll do more. I'll serve you\nas Zaemon served my captain, Tarca. Shall I point a finger at you, and\nsmite your pretty skin with a sudden leprosy?\"\n\nThe girl bowed her shoulders, and went away cowed, and Phorenice turned\nto me. \"My lord,\" she said, \"I am like a young bird in the nest that has\nsuddenly found its wings. Wings have so many uses that I am curious to\ntry them all.\"\n\n\"May each new flight they take be for the good of Atlantis.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, with an eye-flash, \"I know what you have most at heart.\nBut we will go back to the pyramid, and talk this out at more leisure. I\npray you now, my lord, conduct me back to my riding beast.\"\n\nIt appeared then that I was to be condoned for not offering her worship,\nand so putting public question on her deification. It appeared also that\nYlga's interference was looked upon as untimely, and, though I could not\nunderstand the exact reasons for either of these things, I accepted\nthem as they were, seeing that they forwarded the scheme that Zaemon had\nbidden me carry out.\n\nSo when the Empress lent me her fingers--warm, delicate fingers they\nwere, though so skilful to grasp the weapons of war--I took them\ngravely, and led her out of the great circle, which she had polluted\nwith her trickeries. I had expected to see our Lord the Sun take\nvengeance on the profanation whilst it was still in act; but none had\ncome: and I knew that He would choose his own good time for retribution,\nand appoint what instrument He thought best, without my raising a puny\narm to guard His mighty honour.\n\nSo I led this lovely sinful woman back to the huge red mammoth which\nstood there tamely in waiting, and the smell of the sacrifice came\nafter us as we walked. She mounted the stair to the golden castle on the\nshaggy beast's back, and bade me mount also and take seat beside her.\nBut the place of the fan-girl behind was empty, and what we said as we\nrode back through the streets there was none to overhear.\n\nShe was eager to know what had befallen me after the attack on the gate,\nand I told her the tale, laying stress on the worthiness of Nais,\nand uttering an opinion that with care the girl might be won back to\nallegiance again. Only the commands that Zaemon laid upon me when he\nand I spoke together in the sacred tongue, did I withhold, as it is\nnot lawful to repeat these matters save only in the High Council of the\nPriests itself as they sit before the Ark of the Mysteries.\n\n\"You seem to have an unusual kindliness for this rebel Nais,\" said\nPhorenice.\n\n\"She showed herself to me as more clever and thoughtful than the common\nherd.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" she answered, with a sigh that I think was real enough in its way,\n\"an Empress loses much that meaner woman gets as her common due.\"\n\n\"In what particular?\"\n\n\"She misses the honest wooing of her equals.\"\n\n\"If you set up for a Goddess--\" I said.\n\n\"Pah! I wish to be no Goddess to you, Deucalion. That was for the common\npeople; it gives me more power with them; it helps my schemes. All you\nSeven higher priests know that trick of calling down the fire, and it\npleased me to filch it. Can you not be generous, and admit that a woman\nmay be as clever in finding out these natural laws as your musty elder\npriests?\"\n\n\"Remains that you are Empress.\"\n\n\"Nor Empress either. Just think that there is a woman seated beside you\non this cushion, Deucalion, and look upon her, and say what words\ncome first to your lips. Have done with ceremonies, and have done with\nstatecraft. Do you wish to wait on as you are till all your manhood\nwithers? It is well not to hurry unduly in these matters: I am with you\nthere. Yet, who but a fool watches a fruit grow ripe, and then leaves it\ntill it is past its prime?\"\n\nI looked on her glorious beauty, but as I live it left me cold. But I\nremembered the command that had been laid upon me, and forced a smile.\n\"I may have been fastidious,\" I said, \"but I do not regret waiting this\nlong.\"\n\n\"Nor I. But I have played my life as a maid, time enough. I am a woman,\nripe, and full-blooded, and the day has come when I should be more than\nwhat I have been.\"\n\nI let my hand clench on hers. \"Take me to husband then, and I will be a\ngood man to you. But, as I am bidden speak to Phorenice the woman now,\nand not to the Empress, I offer fair warning that I will be no puppet.\"\n\nShe looked at me sidelong. \"I have been master so long that I think\nit will come as enjoyment to be mastered sometimes. No, Deucalion, I\npromise that--you shall be no puppet. Indeed, it would take a lusty lung\nto do the piping if you were to dance against your will.\"\n\n\"Then, as man and wife we will live together in the royal pyramid, and\nwe will rule this country with all the wit that it has pleased the High\nGods to bestow on us. These miserable differences shall be swept aside;\nthe rebels shall go back to their homes, and hunt, and fight the beasts\nin the provinces, and the Priests' Clan shall be pacified. Phorenice,\nyou and I will throw ourselves brain and soul into the government, and\nwe will make Atlantis rise as a nation that shall once more surpass all\nthe world for peace and prosperity.\"\n\nPetulantly she drew her hand away from mine. \"Oh, your conditions, and\nyour Atlantis! You carry a crudeness in these colonial manners of yours,\nDeucalion, that palls on one after the first blunt flavour has worn\naway. Am I to do all the wooing? Is there no thrill of love under all\nyour ice?\"\n\n\"In truth, I do not know what love may be. I have had little enough\nspeech with women all these busy years.\"\n\n\"We were a pair, then, when you landed, though I have heard sighs and\nprotestations from every man that carries a beard in all Atlantis. Some\nof them tickled my fancy for the day, but none of them have moved me\ndeeper. No, I also have not learned what this love may be from my own\npersonal feelings. But, sir, I think that you will teach me soon, if you\ngo on with your coldness.\"\n\n\"From what I have seen, love is for the poor, and the weak, and for\nthose of flighty emotions.\"\n\n\"Then I would that another woman were Empress, and that I were some\nill-dressed creature of the gutter that a strong man could pick up by\nforce, and carry away to his home for sheer passion. Ah! How I could\nrevel in it! How I could respond if he caught my whim!\" She laughed.\n\"But I should lead him a sad life of it if my liking were not so strong\nas his.\"\n\n\"We are as we are made, and we cannot change our inwards which move us.\"\n\nShe looked at me with a sullen glance. \"If I do not change yours, my\nDeucalion, there will be more trouble brewed for this poor Atlantis\nthat you set such store upon. There will be ill doings in this coming\nhousehold of ours if my love grows for you, and yours remains still\nunborn.\"\n\nI believe she would have had me fondle her there in the golden castle on\nthe mammoth's shabby back, before the city streets packed with curious\npeople. She had little enough appetite for privacy at any time. But for\nthe life of me I could not do it. The Gods know I was earnest enough\nabout my task, and They know also how it repelled me. But I was a true\npriest that day, and I had put away all personal liking to carry out the\ncommands which the Council had laid upon me. If I had known how to set\nabout it, I would have fallen in with her mood. But where any of those\nshallow bedizened triflers about the court would have been glibly in his\nelement, I stuck for lack of a dozen words.\n\nThere was no help for it but to leave all, save what I actually felt,\nunsaid. Diplomacy I was trained in, and on most matters I had a glib\nenough tongue. But to palter with women was a lightness I had always\nneglected, and if I had invented would-be pretty speeches out of my\nclumsy inexperience, Phorenice would have seen through the fraud on the\ninstant. She had been nurtured during these years of her rule on a\npap of these silly protestations, and could weigh their value with an\nexpert's exactness.\n\nNor was it a case where honest confession would have served my purpose\nbetter. If I had put my position to her in plain words, it would have\nmade relations worse. And so perforce I had to hold my tongue, and\nsubmit to be considered a clown.\n\n\"I had always heard,\" she said, \"that you colonists in Yucatan were far\nahead of those in Egypt in all the arts and graces. But you, sir, do\nsmall credit to your vice-royalty. Why, I have had gentry from the Nile\ncome here, and you might almost think they had never left their native\nshores.\"\n\n\"They must have made great strides this last twenty years, then. When\nlast I was sent to Egypt to report, the blacks were clearly masters of\nthe land, and our people lived there only on sufferance. Their pyramids\nwere puny, and their cities nothing more than forts.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said mockingly, \"they are mere exiles still, but they remember\ntheir manners. My poor face seemed to please them, at least they all\nwent into raptures over it. And for ten pleasant words, one of them cut\noff his own right hand. We made the bargain, my Egyptian gallant and\nI, and the hand lies dried on some shelf in my apartment to-day as a\npleasant memento.\"\n\nBut here, by a lucky chance for me, an incident occurred which saved me\nfrom further baiting. The rebels outside the walls were conducting their\nday's attack with vigour and some intelligence. More than once during\nour procession the lighter missiles from their war engines had sung\nup through the air, and split against a building, and thrown splinters\nwhich wounded those who thronged the streets. Still there had been\nnothing to ruffle the nerves of any one at all used to the haps of\nwarfare, or in any way to hinder our courtship. But presently, it seems,\nthey stopped hurling stones from their war engines, and took to loading\nthem with carcases of wood lined with the throwing fire.\n\nNow, against stone buildings these did little harm, save only that they\nscorched horribly any poor wretch that was within splash of them when\nthey burst; but when they fell upon the rude wooden booths and rush\nshelters of the poorer folk, they set them ablaze instantly. There was\nno putting out these fires.\n\nThese things also would have given to either Phorenice or myself little\nenough of concern, as they are the trivial and common incidents of\nevery siege; but the mammoth on which we rode had not been so properly\nschooled. When the first blue whiff of smoke came to us down the\nwindings of the street, the huge red beast hoisted its trunk, and began\nto sway its head uneasily. When the smoke drifts grew more dense, and\nhere and there a tongue of flame showed pale beneath the sunshine, it\nstopped abruptly and began to trumpet.\n\nThe guards who led it, tugged manfully at the chains which hung from the\njagged metal collar round its neck, so that the spikes ran deep into its\nflesh, and reminded it keenly of its bondage. But the beast's terror\nat the fire, which was native to its constitution, mastered all its\nnew-bought habits of obedience. From time unknown men have hunted the\nmammoth in the savage ground, and the mammoth has hunted men; and the\nmen have always used fire as a shield, and mammoths have learned to\ndread fire as the most dangerous of all enemies.\n\nPhorenice's brow began to darken as the great beast grew more restive,\nand she shook her red curls viciously. \"Some one shall lose a head for\nthis blundering,\" said she. \"I ordered to have this beast trained to\nstand indifferent to drums, shouting, arrows, stones, and fire, and the\ntrainers assured me that all was done, and brought examples.\"\n\nI slipped my girdle. \"Here,\" I said, \"quick. Let me lower you to the\nground.\"\n\nShe turned on me with a gleam. \"Are you afraid for my neck, then,\nDeucalion?\"\n\n\"I have no mind to be bereaved before I have tasted my wedded life.\"\n\n\"Pish! There is little enough of danger. I will stay and ride it out. I\nam not one of your nervous women, sir. But go you, if you please.\"\n\n\"There is little enough chance of that now.\"\n\nBlood flowed from the mammoth's neck where the spikes of the collar tore\nit, and with each drop, so did the tameness seem to ooze out from it\nalso. With wild squeals and trumpetings it turned and charged viciously\ndown the way it had come, scattering like straws the spearmen who\ntried to stop it, and mowing a great swath through the crowd with its\nmonstrous progress. Many must have been trodden under foot, many killed\nby its murderous trunk, but only their cries came to us. The golden\ncastle, with its canopy of royal snakes, was swayed and tossed, so that\nwe two occupants had much ado not to be shot off like stones from a\ncatapult. But I took a brace with my feet against the front, and one\narm around a pillar, and clapped the spare arm round Phorenice, so as to\noffer myself to her as a cushion.\n\nShe lay there contentedly enough, with her lovely face just beneath my\nchin, and the faint scent of her hair coming in to me with every breath\nI took; and the mammoth charged madly on through the narrow streets. We\nhad outstripped the taint of smoke, and the original cause of fear, but\nthe beast seemed to have forgotten everything in its mad panic. It\nheld furiously on with enormous strides, carrying its trunk aloft, and\ndeafening us with its screams and trumpetings. We left behind us quickly\nall those who had trod in that glittering pageant, and we were carried\nhelplessly on through the wards of the city.\n\nThe beast was utterly beyond all control. So great was its pace that\nthere was no alternative but to try and cling on to the castle. Up there\nwe were beyond its reach. To have leapt off, even if we had avoided\nhaving brains dashed out or limbs smashed by the fall, would have been\nto put ourselves at once at a frightful disadvantage. The mammoth would\nhave scented us immediately, and turned (as is the custom of these\nbeasts), and we should have been trampled into a pulp in a dozen\nseconds.\n\nThe thought came to me that here was the High God's answer to\nPhorenice's sacrilege. The mammoth was appointed to carry out Their\nvengeance by dashing her to pieces, and I, their priest, was to be human\nwitness that justice had been done. But no direct revelation had been\ngiven me on this matter, and so I took no initiative, but hung on to the\nswaying castle, and held the Empress against bruises in my arms.\n\nThere was no guiding the brute: in its insanity of madness it doubled\nmany times upon its course, the windings of the streets confusing it.\nBut by degrees we left the large palaces and pyramids behind, and got\namongst the quarters of artisans, where weavers and smiths gaped at\nus from their doors as we thundered past. And then we came upon the\nmerchants' quarters where men live over their storehouses that do\ntraffic with the people over seas, and then down an open space there\nglittered before us a mirror of water.\n\n\"Now here,\" thought I, \"this mad beast will come to sudden stop, and as\nlike as not will swerve round sharply and charge back again towards the\nheart of the city.\" And I braced myself to withstand the shock, and took\nfresh grip upon the woman who lay against my breast. But with louder\nscreams and wilder trumpetings the mammoth held straight on, and\npresently came to the harbour's edge, and sent the spray sparkling in\nsheets amongst the sunshine as it went with its clumsy gait into the\nwater.\n\nBut at this point the pace was very quickly slackened. The great sewers,\nwhich science devised for the health of the city in the old King's\ntime, vomit their drainings into this part of the harbour, and the solid\nmatter which they carry is quickly deposited as an impalpable sludge.\nInto this the huge beast began to sink deeper and deeper before it could\nhalt in its rush, and when with frightened bellowings it had come to\na stop, it was bogged irretrievably. Madly it struggled, wildly it\nscreamed and trumpeted. The harbour-water and the slime were churned\ninto one stinking compost, and the golden castle in which we clung\nlurched so wildly that we were torn from it and shot far away into the\nwater.\n\nStill there, of course, we were safe, and I was pleased enough to be rid\nof the bumpings.\n\nPhorenice laughed as she swam. \"You handle yourself like a sore man,\nDeucalion. I owe you something for lending me the cushion of your body.\nBy my face! There's more of the gallant about you when it comes to the\ntest than one would guess to hear you talk. How did you like the ride,\nsir? I warrant it came to you as a new experience.\"\n\n\"I'd liefer have walked.\"\n\n\"Pish, man! You'll never be a courtier. You should have sworn that with\nme in your arms you could have wished the bumping had gone on for ever.\nHo, the boat there! Hold your arrows. Deucalion, hail me those fools in\nthat boat. Tell them that, if they hurt so much as a hair of my mammoth,\nI'll kill them all by torture. He'll exhaust himself directly, and when\nhis flurry's done we'll leave him where he is to consider his evil ways\nfor a day or so, and then haul him out with windlasses, and tame him\nafresh. Pho! I could not feel myself to be Phorenice, if I had no fine,\nred, shaggy mammoth to take me out for my rides.\"\n\nThe boat was a ten-slave galley which was churning up from the farther\nside of the harbour as hard as well-plied whips could make oars drive\nher, but at the sound of my shouts the soldiers on her foredeck stopped\ntheir arrowshots, and the steersman swerved her off on a new course to\npick us up. Till then we had been swimming leisurely across an angle of\nthe harbour, so as to avoid landing where the sewers outpoured; but we\nstopped now, treading the water, and were helped over the side by most\nrespectful hands.\n\nThe galley belonged to the captain of the port, a mincing figure of\na mariner, whose highest appetite in life was to lick the feet of the\ngreat, and he began to fawn and prostrate himself at once, and to wish\nthat his eyes had been blinded before he saw the Empress in such deadly\nperil.\n\n\"The peril may pass,\" said she. \"It's nothing mortal that will ever kill\nme. But I have spoiled my pretty clothes, and shed a jewel or two, and\nthat's annoying enough as you say, good man.\"\n\nThe silly fellow repeated a wish that he might be blinded before the\nEmpress was ever put to such discomfort again.\n\nBut it seemed she could be cloyed with flattery. \"If you are tired of\nyour eyes,\" said she, \"let me tell you that you have gone the way to\nhave them plucked out from their sockets. Kill my mammoth, would you,\nbecause he has shown himself a trifle frolicsome? You and your sort want\nmore education, my man. I shall have to teach you that port-captains and\nsuch small creatures are very easy to come by, and very small value when\ngot, but that my mammoth is mine--mine, do you understand?--the property\nof Goddess Phorenice, and as such is sacred.\"\n\nThe port-captain abased himself before her. \"I am an ignorant fellow,\"\nsaid he, \"and heaven was robbed of its brightest ornament when Phorenice\ncame down to Atlantis. But if reparation is permitted me, I have two\nprisoners in the cabin of the boat here who shall be sacrificed to the\nmammoth forthwith. Doubtless it would please him to make sport with\nthem, and spill out the last lees of his rage upon their bodies.\"\n\n\"Prisoners you've got, have you? How taken?\"\n\n\"Under cover of last night they were trying to pass in between the two\nforts which guard the harbour mouth. But their boat fouled the chain,\nand by the light of the torches the sentries spied them. They were\ncaught with ropes, and put in a dungeon. There is an order not to abuse\nprisoners before they have been brought before a judgment?\"\n\n\"It was my order. Did these prisoners offer to buy their lives with\nnews?\"\n\n\"The man has not spoken. Indeed, I think he got his death-wound in being\ntaken. The woman fought like a cat also, so they said in the fort, but\nshe was caught without hurt. She says she has got nothing that would be\nof use to tell. She says she has tired of living like a savage outside\nthe city, and moreover that, inside, there is a man for whose nearness\nshe craves most mightily.\"\n\n\"Tut!\" said Phorenice. \"Is this a romance we have swum to? You see what\naffectionate creatures we women are, Deucalion.\"--The galley was brought\nup against the royal quay and made fast to its golden rings. I handed\nthe Empress ashore, but she turned again and faced the boat, her\ngarments still yielding up a slender drip of water.--\"Produce your woman\nprisoner, master captain, and let us see whether she is a runaway\nwife, or a lovesick girl mad after her sweetheart. Then I will deliver\njudgment on her, and as like as not will surprise you all with my\nclemency. I am in a mood for tender romance to-day.\"\n\nThe port-captain went into the little hutch of a cabin with a white\nface. It was plain that Phorenice's pleasantries scared him. \"The man\nappears to be dead, Your Majesty. I see that his wounds--\"\n\n\"Bring out the woman, you fool. I asked for her. Keep your carrion where\nit is.\"\n\nI saw the fellow stoop for his knife to cut a lashing, and presently who\nshould he bring out to the daylight but the girl I had saved from the\ncave-tigers in the circus, and who had so strangely drawn me to her\nduring the hours that we had spent afterwards in companionship. It was\nclear, too, that the Empress recognised her also. Indeed, she made no\nsecret about the matter, addressing her by name, and mockingly making\ninquiries about the menage of the rebels, and the success of the\nprisoner's amours.\n\n\"This good port-captain tells me that you made a most valiant attempt to\nreturn, Nais, and for an excuse you told that it was your love for\nsome man in the city here which drew you. Come, now, we are willing to\noverlook much of your faults, if you will give us a reasonable chance.\nPoint me out your man, and if he is a proper fellow, I will see that he\nweds you honestly. Yes, and I will do more for you, Nais, since this day\nbrings me to a husband. Seeing that all your estate is confiscate as a\npenalty for your late rebellion, I will charge myself with your dowry,\nand give it back to you. So come, name me the man.\"\n\nThe girl looked at her with a sullen brow. \"I spoke a lie,\" she said;\n\"there is no man.\"\n\nI tried myself to give her advocacy. \"The lady doubtless spoke what came\nto her lips. When a woman is in the grip of a rude soldiery, any excuse\nwhich can save her for the moment must serve. For myself, I should think\nit like enough that she would confess to having come back to her old\nallegiance, if she were asked.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the Empress, \"keep your peace. Any interest you may show in\nthis matter will go far to offend me. You have spoken of Nais in your\nnarrative before, and although your tongue was shrewd and you did not\nsay much, I am a woman and I could read between the lines. Now regard,\nmy rebel, I have no wish to be unduly hard upon you, though once\nyou were my fan-girl, and so your running away to these ill-kempt\nmalcontents, who beat their heads against my city walls, is all the\nmore naughty. But you must meet me halfway. You must give an excuse\nfor leniency. Point me out the man you would wed, and he shall be your\nhusband to-morrow.\"\n\n\"There is no man.\"\n\n\"Then name me one at random. Why, my pretty Nais, not ten months ago\nthere were a score who would have leaped at the chance of having you for\na wife. Drop your coyness, girl, and name me one of those. I warrant\nyou that I will be your ambassadress and will put the matter to him with\nsuch delicacy that he will not make you blush by refusal.\"\n\nThe prisoner moistened her lips. \"I am a maiden, and I have a maiden's\nmodesty. I will die as you choose, but I will not do this indecency.\"\n\n\"Well, I am a maiden too, and though because I am Empress also,\nquestions of State have to stand before questions of my private modesty,\nI can have a sympathy for yours--although in truth it did not obtrude\nunduly when you were my fan-girl, Nais. No, come to think of it, you\nliked a tender glance and a pretty phrase as well as any when you were\nfan-girl. You have grown wild and shy, amongst these savage rebels, but\nI will not punish you for that.\n\n\"Let me call your favourites to memory now. There was Tarca, of course,\nbut Tarca had a difference with that ill-dressed father of yours, and\nwears a leprosy on half his face instead of that beard he used to trim\nso finely. And then there is Tatho, but Tatho is away overseas. Eron,\ntoo, you liked once, but he lost an arm in fighting t'other day, and I\nwould not marry you to less than a whole man. Ah, by my face! I have it,\nthe dainty exquisite, Rota! He is the husband! How well I remember the\nway he used to dress in a change of garb each day to catch your proud\nfancy, girl. Well, you shall have Rota. He shall lead you to wife before\nthis hour to-morrow.\"\n\nAgain the prisoner moistened her lips. \"I will not have Rota, and spare\nme the others. I know why you mock me, Phorenice.\"\n\n\"Then there are three of us here who share one knowledge.\"--She turned\nher eyes upon me. Gods! who ever saw the like of Phorenice's eyes, and\nwho ever saw them lit with such fire as burned within them then?--\"My\nlord, you are marrying me for policy; I am marrying you for policy, and\nfor another reason which has grown stronger of late, and which you may\nguess at. Do you wish still to carry out the match?\"\n\nI looked once at Nais, and then I looked steadily back to Phorenice. The\ncommand given by the mouth of Zaemon from the High Council of the Sacred\nMountain had to outweigh all else, and I answered that such was my\ndesire.\n\n\"Then,\" said she, glowering at me with her eyes, \"you shall build me up\nthe pretty body of Nais beneath a throne of granite as a wedding gift.\nAnd you shall do it too with your own proper hands, my Deucalion, whilst\nI watch your devotion.\"\n\nAnd to Nais she turned with a cruel smile. \"You lied to me, my girl,\nand you spoke truth to the soldiers in the harbour forts. There is a man\nhere in the city you came after, and he is the one man you may not have.\nBecause you know me well, and my methods very thoroughly, your love for\nhim must be very deep, or you would not have come. And so, being here,\nyou shall be put beyond mischief's reach. I am not one of those who see\nluxury in fostering rivals.\n\n\"You came for attention at the hands of Deucalion. By my face! you shall\nhave it. I will watch myself whilst he builds you up living.\"\n\n\n\n\n11. AN AFFAIR WITH THE BARBAROUS FISHERS\n\n\nSo this mighty Empress chose to be jealous of a mere woman prisoner!\n\nNow my mind has been trained to work with a soldierly quickness in these\nmoments of stress, and I decided on my proper course on the instant the\nwords had left her lips. I was sacrificing myself for Atlantis by\norder of the High Council of the Priests, and, if needful, Nais must\nbe sacrificed also, although in the same flash a scheme came to me for\nsaving her.\n\nSo I bowed gravely before the Empress, and said I, \"In this, and in all\nother things where a mere human hand is potent, I will carry out your\nwishes, Phorenice.\" And she on her part patted my arm, and fresh waves\nof feeling welled up from the depths of her wondrous eyes. Surely the\nGods won for her half her schemes and half her battles when they gave\nPhorenice her shape, and her voice, and the matters which lay within the\noutlines of her face.\n\nBy this time the merchants, and the other dwellers adjacent to this part\nof the harbour, where the royal quay stands, had come down, offering\nchanges of raiment, and houses to retire into. Phorenice was all\ngraciousness, and though it was little enough I cared for mere wetness\nof my coat, still that part of the harbour into which we had been thrown\nby the mammoth was not over savoury, and I was glad enough to follow her\nexample. For myself, I said no further word to Nais, and refrained even\nfrom giving her a glance of farewell. But a small sop like this was no\nmeal for Phorenice, and she gave the port-captain strict orders for the\nguarding of his prisoner before she left him.\n\nAt the house into which I was ushered they gave me a bath, and I eased\nmy host of the plainest garment in his store, and he was pleased enough\nat getting off so cheaply. But I had an hour to spend outside on the\npavement listening to the distant din of bombardment before Phorenice\ncame out to me again, and I could not help feeling some grim amusement\nat the face of the merchant who followed. The fellow was clearly ruined.\nHe had a store of jewels and gauds of the most costly kind, which were\nonly in fraction his own, seeing that he had bought them (as the custom\nis) in partnership with other merchants. These had pleased Phorenice's\neye, and so she had taken all and disposed them on her person.\n\n\"Are they not pretty?\" said she, showing them to me. \"See how they flash\nunder the sun. I am quite glad now, Deucalion, that the mammoth gave us\nthat furious ride and that spill, since it has brought me such a bonny\npresent. You may tell the fellow here that some day when he has earned\nsome more, I will come and be his guest again. Ah! They have brought us\nlitters, I see. Well, send one away and do you share mine with me, sir.\nWe must play at being lovers to-day, even if love is a matter which will\ncome to us both with more certainty to-morrow. No; do not order more\nbearers. My own slaves will carry us handily enough. I am glad you\nare not one of your gross, overfed men, Deucalion. I am small and slim\nmyself, and I do not want to be husbanded by a man who will overshadow\nme.\"\n\n\"Back to the royal pyramid?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, nor to the walls. I neither wish to fight nor to sit as Empress\nto-day, sir. As I have told you before, it is my whim to be Phorenice,\nthe maiden, for a few hours, and if some one I wot of would woo me now,\nas other maidens are wooed, I should esteem it a luxury. Bid the slaves\ncarry us round the harbour's rim, and give word to these starers that,\nif they follow, I will call down fire upon them as I did upon the\nsacrifice.\"\n\nNow, I had seen something of the unruliness of the streets myself, and\nI had gathered a hint also from the officer at the gate of the royal\npyramid that night of Phorenice's welcoming banquet. But as whatever\nthere was in the matter must be common knowledge to the Empress, I did\nnot bring it to her memory then. So I dismissed the guard which had\ncome up, and drove away with a few sharp words the throng of gaping\nsightseers who always, silly creatures, must needs come to stare at\ntheir betters; and then I sat in the litter in the place where I was\ninvited, and the bearers put their heads to the pole.\n\nThey swung away with us along the wide pavement which runs between the\nhouses of the merchants and the mariner folk and the dimpling waters of\nthe harbour, and I thought somewhat sadly of the few ships that floated\non that splendid basin now, and of the few evidences of business that\nshowed themselves on the quays. Time was when the ships were berthed\nso close that many had to wait in the estuary outside the walls, and\nmemorials had been sent to the King that the port should be doubled in\nsize to hold the glut of trade. And that, too, in the old days of oar\nand sail, when machines drawing power from our Lord the Sun were but\nrarely used to help a vessel speedily along her course.\n\nThe Egypt voyage and a return was a matter of a year then, as against a\nbrace of months now, and of three ships that set out, one at least could\nbe reckoned upon succumbing to the dangers of the wide waters and the\nterrible beasts that haunt them. But in those old days trade roared with\nlusty life, and was ever growing wider and more heavy. Your merchant\nthen was a portly man and gave generously to the Gods. But now all\nthe world seemed to be in arms, and moreover trade was vulgar. Your\nmerchant, if he was a man of substance, forgot his merchandise, swore\nthat chaffering was more indelicate than blasphemy and curled his beard\nafter the new fashion, and became a courtier. Where his father had spent\nanxious days with cargo tally and ship-master, the son wasted hours in\ndirecting sewing men as they adorned a coat, and nights in vapouring at\na banquet.\n\nOf the smaller merchants who had no substance laid by, taxes and the\nconstant bickerings of war had wellnigh ground them into starvation.\nBesides, with the country in constant uproar, there were few markets\nleft for most merchandise, nor was there aught made now which could be\ncarried abroad. If your weaver is pressed as a fire-tube man he does not\nmake cloth, and if your farmer is playing at rebellion, he does not buy\nslaves to till his fields. Indeed, they told me that a month before my\nreturn, as fine a cargo of slaves had been brought into harbour as ever\ncame out of Europe, and there was nothing for it but to set them ashore\nacross the estuary, and leave them free to starve or live in the wild\nground there as they chose. There was no man in all Atlantis who would\nhold so much as one more slave as a gift.\n\nBut though I was grieved at this falling away, all schemes for remedy\nwould be for afterwards. It would only make ill worse to speak of it as\nwe rode together in the litter. I was growing to know Phorenice's moods\nenough for that. Still, I think that she too had studied mine, and did\nher best to interest me between her bursts of trifling. We went out to\nwhere the westernmost harbour wall joins the land, and there the panting\nbearers set us down. She led me into a little house of stone which stood\nby itself, built out on a promontory where there is a constant run of\ntide, and when we had been given admittance, after much unbarring, she\nshowed me her new gold collectors.\n\nIn the dry knowledge taught in the colleges and groves of the Sacred\nMountain it had been a common fact to us that the metal gold was present\nin a dissolved state in all sea water, but of plans for dragging it\nforth into yellow hardness, none had ever been discussed. But here this\nfield-reared upstart of an Empress had stumbled upon the trick as though\nit had been written in a book.\n\nShe patted my arm laughingly as I stared curiously round the place. \"I\ntell all others in Atlantis that only the Gods have this secret,\" said\nshe, \"and that They gave it to me as one of themselves. But I am no\nGoddess to you, am I, Deucalion? And, by my face! I have no other\nexplanation of how this plan was invented. We'll suppose I must have\ndreamed it. Look! The sea-water sluices in through that culvert, and\npasses over these rough metal plates set in the floor, and then flows\nout again yonder in its natural course. You see the yellow metal caught\nin the ridges of the plates? That is gold. And my fellows here melt it\nwith fire into bars, and take it to my smith's in the city. The tides\nvary constantly, as you priests know well, as the quiet moon draws them,\nand it does not take much figuring to know how much of the sea passes\nthrough these culverts in a month and how much gold to a grain should be\ncaught in the plates. My fellows here at first thought to cheat me, but\nI towed two of them in the water once behind a galley till the cannibal\nfish ate them, and since then the others have given me credit for--for\nwhat do you think?\"\n\n\"More divinity.\"\n\n\"I suppose it is that. But I am letting you see how it is done. Just\nhave the head to work out a little sum, and see what an effect can be\ngained. You will be a God yet yourself, Deucalion, with these silly\nAtlanteans, if only you will use your wit and cleverness.\"\n\nWas she laughing at me? Was she in earnest? I could not tell. Sometimes\nshe pointed out that her success and triumphs were merely the reward\nof thought and brilliancy, and next moment she gave me some impossible\nexplanation and left me to deduce that she must be more than mortal or\nthe thing could never have been found. In good truth, this little woman\nwith her supple mind and her supple body mystified me more and more the\nlonger I stayed by her side; and more and more despairing did I grow\nthat Atlantis could ever be restored by my agency to peace and the\nancient Gods, even after I had carried out the commands of the High\nCouncil, and taken her to wife.\n\nOnly one plan seemed humanly possible, and that was to curb her further\nmischievousness by death and then leave the wretched country naturally\nto recover. It was just a dagger-stroke, and the thing was done. Yet the\nvery idea of this revolted me, and when the desperate thought came to my\nmind (which it did ever and anon), I hugged to myself the answer that if\nit were fitting to do this thing, the High Gods in Their infinite wisdom\nwould surely have put definite commands upon me for its carrying out.\n\nYet, such was the fascination of Phorenice, that when presently we\nleft her gold collectors, and stumbled into such peril, that a little\nwithholding of my hand would have gained her a passage to the nether\nGods, I found myself fighting when she called upon me, as seldom I have\nfought before. And though, of course, some blame for this must be laid\nupon that lust of battle which thrills even the coldest of us when blows\nbegin to whistle and war-cries start to ring, there is no doubt also\nthat the pleasure of protecting Phorenice, and the distaste for seeing\nher pulled down by those rude, uncouth fishers put special nerve and\nvehemence into my blows.\n\nThe cause of the matter was the unrest and the prevalency to street\nviolence which I have spoken of above, and the desperate poverty of\nthe common people, which led them to take any risk if it showed them a\nchance of winning the wherewithal to purchase a meal. We had once more\nmounted the litter, and once more the bearers, with their heads beneath\nthe pole, bore us on at their accustomed swinging trot. Phorenice was\ntelling me about her new supplies of gold. She had made fresh sumptuary\nlaws, it appeared.\n\n\"In the old days,\" said she, \"when yellow gold was tediously dredged up\ngrain by grain from river gravels in the dangerous lands, a quill\nfull would cost a rich man's savings, and so none but those whose high\nstation fitted them to be so adorned could wear golden ornaments. But\nwhen the sea-water gave me gold here by the double handful a day, I\nfound that the price of these river hoards decreased, and one day--could\nyou credit it?--a common fellow, who was one of my smiths, came to me\nwearing a collar of yellow gold on his own common neck. Well, I had\nthat neck divided, as payment for his presumption; and as I promised\nto repeat the division promptly on all other offenders, that special\nspecies of forwardness seems to be checked for the time. There are many\nexasperations, Deucalion, in governing these common people.\"\n\nShe had other things to say upon the matter, but at this point I saw two\nclumsy boats of fishers paddling to us from over the ripples, and at the\nsame time amongst the narrow lanes which led between the houses on\nthe other side of us, savage-faced men were beginning to run after the\nlitter in threatening clusters.\n\n\"With permission,\" I said, \"I will step out of the conveyance and\nscatter this rabble.\"\n\n\"Oh, the people always cluster round me. Poor ugly souls, they seem\nto take a strange delight in coming to stare at my pretty looks. But\nscatter them. I have said I did not wish to be followed. I am taking\nholiday now, Deucalion, am I not, whilst you learn to woo me?\"\n\nI stepped to the ground. The rough fishers in the boats were beginning\nto shout to those who dodged amongst the houses to see to it that we\ndid not escape, and the numbers who hemmed us in on the shore side were\nincreasing every moment. The prospect was unpleasant enough. We had come\nout beyond the merchants' quarters, and were level with those small\nhuts of mud and grass which the fishing population deem sufficient for\nshelter, and which has always been a spot where turbulence might be\nexpected. Indeed, even in those days of peace and good government in\nthe old King's time, this part of the city had rarely been without its\nweekly riot.\n\nThe life of the fisherman is the most hard that any human toilers have\nto endure. Violence from the wind and waves, and pelting from firestones\nout of the sky are their daily portion; the great beasts that dwell in\nthe seas hunt them with savage persistence, and it is a rare day when\nat least some one of the fishers' guild fails to come home to answer the\ntally.\n\nMoreover, the manner which prevails of catching fish is not without its\nrisks.\n\nTo each man there is a large sea-fowl taken as a nestling, and\ntrained to the work. A ring of bronze is round its neck to prevent its\nswallowing the spoil for which it dives, and for each fish it takes and\nflies back with to the boat, the head and tail and inwards are given to\nit for a reward, the ring being removed whilst it makes the meal.\n\nThe birds are faithful, once they have got a training, and are seldom\nknown to desert their owners; but, although the fishers treat them more\nkindly than they do their wives, or children of their own begetting, the\nlife of the birds is precarious like that of their masters. The larger\nbeasts and fish of the sea prey on them as they prey on the smaller\nfish, and so whatever care may be lavished upon them, they are most\nliable to sudden cutting off.\n\nAnd here is another thing that makes the life of the fisher most\nprecarious: if his fishing bird be slain, and the second which he has\nin training also come by ill fortune, he is left suddenly bereft of all\nutensils of livelihood, and (for aught his guild-fellows care) he may go\nstarve. For these fishers hold that the Gods of the sea regulate their\ncraft, and that if one is not pleasing to Them They rob him of his\nbirds; after which it would be impious to have any truck or dealing\nwith such a fellow; and accordingly he is left to starve or rob as he\nchooses.\n\nAll of which circumstances tend to make the fishers rude, desperate\nmen, who have been forced into the trade because all other callings have\nrejected them. They are fellows, moreover, who will spend the gains of\na month on a night's debauch, for fear that the morrow will rob them of\nlife and the chance of spending; and, moreover, it is their one point of\nhonour to be curbed in no desire by an ordinary fear of consequences. As\nwill appear.\n\nI went quickly towards the largest knot of these people, who were\nskulking behind the houses, leaving the litter halted in the path behind\nme, and I bade them sharply enough to disperse. \"For an employment,\"\nI added, \"put your houses in order, and clean the fish offal from the\nlanes between them. To-morrow I will come round here to inspect, and put\nthis quarter into a better order. But for to-day the Empress (whose name\nbe adored) wishes for a privacy, so cease your staring.\"\n\n\"Then give us money,\" said a shrill voice from amongst the huts.\n\n\"I will send you a torch in an hour's time,\" I said grimly, \"and rig you\na gallows, if you give me more annoyance. To your kennels, you!\"\n\nI think they would have obeyed the voice of authority if they had been\nleft to themselves. There was a quick stir amongst them. Those that\nstood in the sunlight instinctively slipped into the shadow, and many\ndodged into the houses and cowered in dark corners out of sight. But the\nmen in the two hide-covered fisher-boats that were paddling up, called\nthem back with boisterous cries.\n\nI signed to the litter-bearers to move on quickly along their road.\nThere was need of discipline here, and I was minded to deal it out\nmyself with a firm hand. I judged that I could prevent them following\nthe Empress, but if she still remained as a glittering bait for them to\nrob, and I had to protect her also, it might be that my work would not\nbe done so effectively.\n\nBut it seems I was presumptuous in giving an order which dealt with the\nperson of Phorenice. She bade the bearers stand where they were, and\nstepped out, and drew her weapons from beneath the cushions. She came\ntowards me strapping a sword on to her hip, and carrying a well-dinted\ntarget of gold on her left forearm. \"An unfair trick,\" cries she,\nlaughing. \"If you will keep a fight to yourself now, Deucalion, where\nwill your greediness carry you when I am your shrinking, wistful little\nwife? Are these fools truly going to stand up against us?\"\n\nI was not coveting a fight, but it seemed as if there would be no\navoidance of it now. The robe and the glittering gauds of which\nPhorenice had recently despoiled the merchant, drew the eyes of these\npeople with keen attraction. The fishers in the boats paddled into\nthe surf which edged the beach, and leaped overside and left the frail\nbasket-work structures to be spewed up sound or smashed, as chance\nordered. And from the houses, and from the filthy lanes between them,\npoured out hordes of others, women mixed with the men, gathering round\nus threateningly.\n\n\"Have a care,\" shouted one on the outskirts of the crowd. \"She called\ndown fire for the sacrifice once to-day, and she can burn up others here\nif she chooses.\"\n\n\"So much the more for those that are left,\" retorted another. \"She\ncannot burn all.\"\n\n\"Nay, I will not burn any,\" said Phorenice, \"but you shall look upon my\nsword-play till you are tired.\"\n\nI heard her say that with some malicious amusement, knowing (as one of\nthe Seven) how she had called down the fires of the sky to burn that\ncloven-hoofed horse offered in sacrifice, and knowing too, full well,\nthat she could bring down no fire here. But they gave us little enough\ntime for wordy courtesies. Their Empress never went far unattended, and,\nfor aught the wretches knew, an escort might be close behind. So what\npilfering they did, it behoved them to get done quickly.\n\nThey closed in, jostling one another to be first, and the reek of their\nfilthy bodies made us cough. A grimy hand launched out to seize some of\nthe jewels which flashed on Phorenice's breast, and I lopped it off\nat the elbow, so that it fell at her feet, and a second later we were\nengaged.\n\n\"Your back to mine, comrade,\" cried she, with a laugh, and then drew and\nlaid about her with fine dexterity. Bah! but it was mere slaughter, that\nfirst bout.\n\nThe crowd hustled inwards with such greediness to seize what they could,\nthat none had space to draw back elbow for a thrust, and we two kept a\ncircle round us by sheer whirling of steel. It is necessary to do one's\nwork cleanly in these bouts, as wounded left on the ground unnoticed\nbefore one are as dangerous as so many snakes. But as we circled round\nin our battling I noted that all of Phorenice's quarry lay peaceful\nand still. By the Gods! but she could play a fine sword, this dainty\nEmpress. She touched life with every thrust.\n\nYes, it was plain to see, now an example was given, that the throne of\nAtlantis had been won, not by a lovely face and a subtle tongue alone;\nand (as a fighter myself) I did not like Phorenice the less for the\nknowledge. I could but see her out of the corner of my eye, and that\nonly now and again, for the fishers, despite their ill-knowledge of\nfence, and the clumsiness of their weapons, had heavy numbers, and most\nsavage ferocity; and as they made so confident of being able to pull\nus down, it required more than a little hard battling to keep them from\ndoing it. Ay, by the Gods! it was at times a fight my heart warmed to,\nand if I had not contrived to pluck a shield from one fool who came too\nvain-gloriously near me with one, I could not swear they would not have\ndragged me down by sheer ravening savageness.\n\nAnd always above the burly uproar of the fight came very pleasantly to\nmy ears Phorenice's cry of \"Deucalion!\" which she chose as her battle\nshout. I knew her, of course, to be a past-mistress of the art of\ncompliment, and it was no new thing for me to hear the name roared out\nabove a battle din, but it was given there under circumstances which\nwere peculiar, and for the life of me I could not help being tickled by\nthe flattery.\n\nCondemn my weakness how you will, but I came very near then to liking\nthe Empress of Atlantis in the way she wished. And as for that other\nwoman who should have filled my mind, I will confess that the stress of\nthe moment, and the fury of the engagement, had driven both her and her\nstrait completely out beyond the marches of my memory. Of such frail\nstuff are we made, even those of us who esteem ourselves the strongest.\n\nNow it is a temptation few men born to the sword can resist, to throw\nthemselves heart and soul into a fight for a fight's sake, and it seems\nthat women can be bitten with the same fierce infection. The attack\nslackened and halted. We stood in the middle of a ring of twisted dead,\nand the rest of the fishers and their women who hemmed us in shrank back\nout of reach of our weapons.\n\nIt was the moment for a truce, and the moment when a few strong words\nwould have sent them back cowering to their huts, and given us free\npassage to go where we chose. But no, this Phorenice must needs sing a\nhymn to her sword and mine, gloating over our feats and invulnerability;\nand then she must needs ask payment for the bearers of her litter whom\nthey had killed, and then speak balefully of the burnings, and the\nskinnings, and the sawings asunder with which this fishers' quarter\nwould be treated in the near future, till they learned the virtues of\ndeportment and genteel manners.\n\n\"It makes your backs creep, does it?\" said Phorenice. \"I do not wonder.\nThis severity must have its unpleasant side. But why do you not put it\nbeyond my power to give the order? Either you must think yourselves Gods\nor me no Goddess, or you would not have gone on so far. Come now, you\nnasty-smelling people, follow out your theory, and if you make a good\nfight of it, I swear by my face I will be lenient with those who do not\nfall.\"\n\nBut there was no pressing up to meet our swords. They still ringed us\nin, savage and sullen, beyond the ring of their own dead, and would\nneither run back to the houses, nor give us the game of further fight.\nThere was a certain stubborn bravery about them that one could not but\nadmire, and for myself I determined that next time it became my duty\nto raise troops, I would catch a handful of these men, and teach them\nhandiness with the utensils of war, and train them to loyalty and\nfaithfulness. But presently from behind their ranks a stone flew, and\nthough it whizzed between the Empress and myself, and struck down a\nfisher, it showed that they had brought a new method into their attack,\nand it behoved us to take thought and meet it.\n\nI looked round me up and down the beach. There was no sign of a rescue.\n\"Phorenice,\" I said in the court tongue, which these barbarous fishers\nwould know little enough of, \"I take it that a whiff of the sea-breeze\nwould come very pleasant after all this warm play. As you can show such\npretty sword work, will you cut me a way down to the beach, and I will\ndo my poor best to keep these creatures from snapping at our heels?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried she. \"Then I am to have a courtier for a husband after all.\nWhy have you kept back your flattering speeches till now? Is that your\ntrick to make me love you?\"\n\n\"I will think out the reason for it another time.\"\n\n\"Ah, these stern, commanding husbands,\" said she, \"how they do press\nupon their little wives!\" and with that leaped over the ring of dead\nbefore her, and cut and stabbed a way through those that stood between\nher and the waters which creamed and crashed upon the beach. Gods!\nwhat a charge she made. It made me tingle with admiration as I followed\nsideways behind her, guarding the rear. And I am a man that has spent so\nmany years in battling, that it takes something far out of the common to\nmove me to any enthusiasm in this matter.\n\nThere were two boats creaking and washing about in the edge of the surf,\nbut in one, happily, the wicker-work which made its frame was crushed\nby the weight of the waves into a shapeless bundle of sticks, and would\ntake half a day to replace. So that, let us but get the other craft\nafloat, and we should be free from further embroiling. But the fishers\nwere quick to see the object of this new manoeuvre. \"Guard the boat,\"\nthey shouted. \"Smash her; slit her skin with your knives! Tear her with\nyour fingers! Swim her out to sea! Oh, at least take the paddles!\"\n\nBut, if these clumsy fishers could run, Phorenice was like a legged\nsnake for speed. She was down beside the boat before any could reach\nit, laughing and shouting out that she could beat them at every point.\nMyself, I was slower of foot; and, besides, there was some that offered\nme a fight on the road, and I was not wishful to baulk them; and\nmoreover, the fewer we left clamouring behind, the fewer there would be\nto speed our going with their stones. Still I came to the beach in good\norder, and laid hands on the flimsy boat and tipped her dry.\n\n\"Fighting is no trade for, me,\" I cried, \"whilst you are here,\nPhorenice. Guard me my back and walk out into the water.\"\n\nI took the boat, thrusting it afloat, and wading with it till two lines\nof the surf were past. The fishers swarmed round us, active as fish in\ntheir native element, and strove mightily to get hands on the boat and\nslit the hides which covered it with their eager fingers. But I had a\nspare hand, and a short stabbing-knife for such close-quarter work, and\nhere, there, and everywhere was Phorenice the Empress, with her thirsty\ndripping sword. By the Gods! I laughed with sheer delight at seeing her\nart of fence.\n\nBut the swirl of a great fish into the shallows, and the squeal of\na fisher as he was dragged down and home away into the deep, made me\nmindful of foes that no skill can conquer, and no bravery avoid. Without\ntaking time to give the Empress a word of warning, I stooped, and flung\nan arm round her, and threw her up out of the water into the boat, and\nthen thrust on with all my might, driving the flimsy craft out to\nsea, whilst my legs crept under me for fear of the beasts which swam\ninvisible beneath the muddied waters.\n\nTo the fishers, inured to these horrid perils by daily association,\nthe seizing of one of their number meant little, and they pressed on,\ncareless of their dull lives, eager only to snatch the jewels which\nstill flaunted on Phorenice's breast. Of the vengeance that might come\nafter they recked nothing; let them but get the wherewithal for one\nnight's good debauch, and they would forget that such a thing as the\nmorning of a morrow could have existence.\n\nTwo fellows I caught and killed that, diving down beneath, tried to slit\nthe skin of the boat out of sight under the water; and Phorenice cared\nfor all those that tried to put a hand on the gunwales. Yes, and she did\nmore than that. A huge long-necked turtle that was stirred out of the\nmud by the turmoil, came up to daylight, and swung its great horn-lipped\nmouth to this side and that, seeking for a prey. The fishers near it\ndodged and dived. I, thrusting at the stern of the boat, could only hope\nit would pass me by and so offered an easy mark. It scurried towards\nme, champing its noisy lips, and beating the water into spray with its\nflippers.\n\nBut Phorenice was quick with a remedy and a rescue. She passed her sword\nthrough one of the fishers that pressed her, and then thrust the body\ntowards the turtle. The great neck swooped towards it; the long slimy\nfeelers which protruded from its head quivered and snuffled; and then\nthe horny green jaws crunched on it, and drew it down out of sight.\n\nThe boat was in deep water now, and Phorenice called upon me to come in\nover the side, she the while balancing nicely so that the flimsy thing\nshould not be overset. The fishers had given up their pursuit, finding\nthat they earned nothing but lopped-off arms and split faces by coming\nwithin swing of this terrible sword of their Empress, and so contented\nthemselves with volleying jagged stones in the hopes of stunning us or\nsplitting the boat. However, Phorenice crouched in the stern, holding\nthe two shields--her own golden target, and the rough hide buckler I\nhad won--and so protected both of us whilst I paddled, and though many\nstones clattered against the shields, and hit the hide covering of the\nboat, so that it resounded like a drum, none of them did damage, and we\ndrew quickly out of their range.\n\n\n\n\n12. THE DRUG OF OUR LADY THE MOON\n\n\nOur Lord the Sun was riding towards the end of His day, and the smoke\nfrom a burning mountain fanned black and forbidding before His face.\nPhorenice wrung the water from her clothes and shivered. \"Work hard with\nthose paddles, Deucalion, and take me in through the water-gate and let\nme be restored to my comforts again. That merchant would rue if he saw\nhow his pretty garments were spoiled, and I rue, too, being a woman,\nand remembering that he at least has no others I can take in place of\nthese.\" She looked at me sidelong, tossing back the short red hair from\nher eyes. \"What think you of my wisdom in coming where we have come\nwithout an escort?\"\n\n\"The Empress can do no wrong,\" I quoted the old formula with a smile.\n\n\"At least I have shown you that I can fight. I caught you looking your\napproval of me quite pleasantly once or twice. You were a difficult man\nto thaw, Deucalion, but you warm perceptibly as you keep on being near\nme. La, sir, we shall be a pair of rustic sweethearts yet, if this\ngoes on. I am glad I thought of the device of going near those smelly\nfishers.\"\n\nSo she had taken me out in the litter unattended for the plain purpose\nof inviting a fight, and showing me her skill at arms, and perhaps, too,\nof seeing in person how I also carried myself in a moment of stress.\nWell, if we were to live on together as husband and wife, it was good\nthat each should know to a nicety the other's powers; and also, I am too\nmuch of an old battler and too much enamoured with the glorious handling\nof arms to quarrel very deeply with any one who offers me a tough\nupstanding fight. Still for the life of me, I could not help comparing\nPhorenice with another woman. With a similar chance open before us, Nais\nhad robbed me of the struggle through a sheer pity for those squalid\nrebels who did not even call her chieftain; whilst here was this Empress\nfrittering away two score of the hardiest of her subjects merely to\ngratify a whim.\n\nYet, loyal to my vow as a priest, and to the commands set upon me by the\nhigh council on the Sacred Mountain, I tried to put away these wayward\nthoughts and comparisons. As I rowed over the swingings of the waves\ntowards the forts which guard the harbour's mouth, I sent prayers to the\nHigh Gods to give my tongue dexterity, and They through Their love for\nthe country of Atlantis, and the harassed people, whom it was my deep\nwish to serve, granted me that power of speech which Phorenice loved.\nHer eyes glowed upon me as I talked.\n\nThis beach of the fishers where we had had our passage at arms is safe\nfrom ship attack from without, by reason of a chain of jagged rocks\nwhich spring up from the deep, and run from the harbour side to the end\nof the city wall. The fishers know the passes, and can oftentimes get\nthrough to the open water beyond without touching a stone; or if they\ndo see a danger of hitting on the reef, leap out and carry their light\nboats in their hands till the water floats them again. But here I had\nneither the knowledge nor the dexterity, and, thought I, now the High\nGods will show finally if They wish this woman who has defiled them to\nreign on in Atlantis, and if also They wish me to serve as her husband.\n\nI cried these things in my heart, and waited to receive the omen. There\nwas no half-answer. A great wave rose in the lagoon behind us, a wave\nsuch as could have only been caused by an earth tremor, and on its sleek\nback we were hurled forward and thrown clear of the reefs with their\nseaweeds licking round us, without so much as seeing a stone of the\nbarrier. I bowed my head as I rowed on towards the harbour forts. It was\nplain that not yet would the High Gods take vengeance for the insults\nwhich this lovely woman had offered Them.\n\nThe sentries in the two forts beat drums at one another in their\naccustomed rotation, and in the growing dusk were going to pay little\nenough attention to the fishingboat which lay against the great chain\nclamouring to have it lowered. But luckily a pair of officers were\ntaking the air of the evening in a stone-dropping turret of the roof\nof the nearer fort, and these recognised the tone of our shouts. They\nsilenced the drums, torches were lowered to make sure of our faces, and\nthen with a splash the great chain was dropped into the water to give us\npassage.\n\nA galley lay inside, nuzzling the harbour wall, and presently the ladder\nof ropes was let down from the top of the nearest fort, and a crew came\ndown to man the oars. There were the customary changes of raiment too,\ngiven as presents by the officers of the fort, and these we put on in\nthe cabin of the galley in place of the sodden clothes we wore. There\nare fevers to be gained by carrying wet clothes after sunset, and though\nfrom personal experience I have learned that these may be warded off\nwith drugs, I noticed with some grim amusement that the Empress had\nsufficiently little of the Goddess about her to fear very much the\nailments which are due to frail humanity.\n\nThe galley rowed swiftly across the calm waters of the harbour, and made\nfast to the rings of gold on the royal quay, and whilst we were waiting\nfor litters to be brought, I watched a lantern lit in the boat\nwhich stood guard over Phorenice's mammoth. The huge red beast stood\nshoulder-deep in the harbour water, with trunk up-turned. It was tamed\nnow, and the light of the boat's lantern fell on the little ripples sent\nout by its tremblings. But I did not choose to intercede or ask\nmercy for it. If the mammoth sank deeper in the harbour mud, and was\nswallowed, I could have borne the loss with equanimity.\n\nTo tell the truth, that ride on the great beast's back had impressed me\nunfavourably. In fact, it put into me a sense of helplessness that\nwas wellnigh intolerable. Perhaps circumstances have made me unduly\nself-reliant: on that others must judge. But I will own to having a\npreference for walking on my own proper feet, as the Gods in fashioning\nour shapes most certainly intended. On my own feet I am able to guard my\nown head and neck, and have done on four continents, throughout a long\nand active life, and on many a thousand occasions. But on the back of\nthat detestable mammoth, pah! I grew as nervous as a child or a dastard.\n\nHowever, I had little enough leisure for personal megrims just then.\nWhilst we waited, Phorenice asked the port-captain (who must needs come\nup officiously to make his salutations) after the disposal of Nais,\nand was told that she had been clapped into a dungeon beneath the royal\npyramid, and the officer of the guard there had given his bond for her\nsafe-keeping.\n\n\"It is to be hoped he understands his work,\" said the Empress. \"That\npretty Nais knows the pyramid better than most, and it may be he will\nbe sent to the tormentors for putting her in a cell which had a secret\noutlet. You would feel pleasure if the girl escaped, Deucalion?\"\n\n\"Assuredly,\" said I, knowing how useless it would be to make a secret of\nthe matter. \"I have no enmity against Nais.\"\n\n\"But I have,\" said she viciously, \"and I am still minded to lock your\nfaith to me by that wedding gift you know of.\"\n\n\"The thing shall be done,\" I said. \"Before all, the Empress of\nAtlantis.\"\n\n\"Poof! Deucalion, you are too stiff and formal. You ought to be mightily\nhonoured that I condescend to be jealous of your favours. Your hand,\nsir, please, to help me into the litter. And now come in beside me,\nand keep me warm against the night air. Ho! you guards there with the\ntorches! Keep farther back against the street walls. The perfume you are\nburning stifles me.\"\n\nAgain there was a feast that night in the royal banqueting-hall; again I\nsat beside Phorenice on the raised dais which stands beneath the symbols\nof the snake and the out-stretched hand. What had been taken for granted\nbefore about our forthcoming relationship was this time proclaimed\nopenly; the Empress herself acknowledged me as her husband that was to\nbe; and all that curled and jewelled throng of courtiers hailed me as\ngreater than themselves, by reason of this woman's choice. There was\nmethod, too, in their salutation. Some rumour must have got about of my\npreference for the older and simpler habits, and there was no drinking\nwine to my health after the new and (as I considered) impertinent\nmanner. Decorously, each lord and lady there came forward, and each in\nturn spilt a goblet at my feet; and when I called any up, whether man\nor woman, to receive tit-bits from my platter, it was eaten simply and\nthankfully, and not kissed or pocketed with any extravagant gesture.\n\nThe flaring jets of earth-breath showed me, too, so I thought, a plainer\nhabit of dress, and a more sober mien amongst this thoughtless mob\nof banqueters. And, indeed, it must have been plain to notice, for\nPhorenice, leaning over till the ruddy curls on her shoulder brushed\nmy face, chided me in a playful whisper as having usurped her high\nauthority already.\n\n\"Oh, sir,\" she pleaded mockingly, \"do not make your rule over us too\nascetic. I have given no orders for this change, but to-night there are\nno perfumes in the air; the food is so plain and I have half a mind to\nburn the cook; and as for the clothes and gauds of these diners, by my\nface! they might have come straight from the old King's reign before I\nstepped in here to show how tasteful could be colours on a robe, or how\npretty the glint of a jewel. It's done by no orders of mine, Deucalion.\nThey have swung round to this change by sheer courtier instinct. Why,\nlook at the beards of the men! There is not half the curl about many of\nthem to-day that they showed with such exquisiteness yesterday. By my\nface! I believe they'd reap their chins to-morrow as smooth as yours,\nif you go on setting the fashions at this prodigious rate and I do not\ninterfere.\"\n\n\"Why hinder them if they feel more cleanly shaven?\"\n\n\"No, sir. There shall be only one clean chin where a beard can grow in\nall Atlantis, and that shall be carried by the man who is husband to the\nEmpress. Why, my Deucalion, would you have no sumptuary laws? Would you\nhave these good folk here and the common people outside imitate us in\nevery cut of the hair and every fold of a garment which it pleases us to\ndiscover? Come, sir, if you and I chose to say that our sovereignty was\nmarked only by our superior strength of arm and wit, they would hate us\nat once for our arrogance; whereas, if we keep apart to ourselves a\nfew mere personal decorations, these become just objects to admire and\npleasantly envy.\"\n\n\"You show me that there is more in the office of a ruler than meets the\neye.\"\n\n\"And yet they tell me, and indeed show me, that you have ruled with some\nsuccess.\"\n\n\"I employed the older method. It requires a Phorenice to invent these\nnicer flights.\"\n\n\"Flatterer!\" said she, and smote me playfully with the back of her\nlittle fingers on my arm. \"You are becoming as great a courtier as any\nof them. You make me blush with your fine pleasantries, Deucalion, and\nthere is no fan-girl here to-night to cool my cheek. I must choose me\nanother fan-girl. But it shall not be Ylga. Ylga seems to have more of a\nkindness for you than I like, and if she is wise she will go live in her\npalace at the other side of the city, and there occupy herself with the\nordering of her slaves, and the makings of embroideries. I shall not\nbe hard on Ylga unless she forces me, but I will have no woman in this\nkingdom treat you with undue civility.\"\n\n\"And how am I to act,\" said I, falling in with her mood, \"when I see and\nhear all the men of Atlantis making their protestations before you? By\nyour own confession they all love you as ardently as they seem to have\nloved you hopelessly.\"\n\n\"Ah, now,\" she said, \"you must not ask me to do impossibilities. I am\npowerful if you will. But I have no force which will govern the hearts\nof these poor fellows on matters such as that. But if you choose, you\nmake proclamation that I am given now body and inwards to you, and if\nthey continue to offend your pride in this matter, you may take your\nculprits, and give them over to the tormentors. Indeed, Deucalion, I\nthink it would be a pretty attention to me if you did arrange some such\nceremony. It seems to me a present,\" she added with a frown, \"that the\njealousy is too much on one side.\"\n\n\"You must not expect that a man who has been divorced from love for all\nof a busy life can learn all its niceties in an instant. Myself, I was\nfeeling proud of my progress. With any other schoolmistress than you,\nPhorenice, I should not be near so forward. In fact (if one may judge by\nmy past record), I should not have begun to learn at all.\"\n\n\"I suppose you think I should be satisfied with that? Well, I am not. I\ncan be finely greedy over some matters.\"\n\nThe banquet this night did not extend to inordinate length. Phorenice\nhad gone through much since last she slept, and though she had declared\nherself Goddess in the meantime, it seemed that her body remained mortal\nas heretofore. The black rings of weariness had grown under her wondrous\neyes, and she lay back amongst the cushions of the divan with her limbs\nslackened and listless. When the dancers came and postured before us,\nshe threw them a jewel and bade them begone before they had given a half\nof their performance, and the poet, a silly swelling fellow who came to\nsing the deeds of the day, she would not hear at all.\n\n\"To-morrow,\" she said wearily, \"but for now grant me peace. My Lord\nDeucalion has given me much food for thought this day, and presently\nI go to my chamber to muse over the future policies of this State\nthroughout the night. To-morrow come to me again, and if your poetry is\ngood and short, I will pay you surprisingly. But see to it that you\nare not long-winded. If there are superfluous words, I will pay you for\nthose with the stick.\"\n\nShe rose to her feet then, and when the banqueters had made their\nsalutation to us, I led her away from the banqueting-hall and down the\npassages with their secret doors which led to her private chambers.\nShe clung on my arm, and once when we halted whilst a great stone\nblock swung slowly ajar to let us pass, she drooped her head against my\nshoulder. Her breath came warm against my cheek, and the loveliness of\nher face so close at hand surpasses the description of words. I think it\nwas in her mind that I should kiss the red lips which were held so near\nto mine, but willing though I was to play the part appointed, I could\nnot bring myself to that. So when the stone block had swung, she drew\naway with a sigh, and we went on without further speech.\n\n\"May the High Gods treat you tenderly,\" I said, when we came to the door\nof her bed-chamber.\n\n\"I am my own God,\" said she, \"in all things but one. By my face! you are\na tardy wooer, Deucalion. Where do you go now?\"\n\n\"To my own chamber.\"\n\n\"Oh, go then, go.\"\n\n\"Is there anything more I could do?\"\n\n\"Nothing that your wit or your will would prompt you to. Yes, indeed,\nyou are finely decorous, Deucalion, in your old-fashioned way, but you\nare a mighty poor wooer. Don't you know, my man, that a woman esteems\nsome things the more highly if they are taken from her by rude force?\"\n\n\"It seems I know little enough about women.\"\n\n\"You never said a truer word. Bah! And I believe your coldness brings\nyou more benefit in a certain matter than any show of passion could\nearn. There, get you gone, if the atmosphere of a maiden's bed-chamber\nhurts your rustic modesty, and your Gods keep you, Deucalion, if that's\nthe phrase, and if you think They can do it. Get you gone, man, and\nleave me solitary.\"\n\nI had taken the plan of the pyramid out of the archives before the\nbanquet and learned it thoroughly, and so was able to thread my way\nthrough its angular mazes without pause or blunder. I, too, was heavily\nwearied with what I had gone through since my last snatch of sleep, but\nI dare set apart no time for rest just then. Nais must be sacrificed in\npart for the needs of Atlantis; but a plan had come to me by which it\nseemed that she need not be sacrificed wholly; and to carry this through\nthere was need for quick thought and action.\n\nHelp came to me also from a quarter I did not expect. As I passed along\nthe tortuous way between the ponderous stones of the pyramid, which led\nto the apartments that had been given me by Phorenice, a woman glided\nup out of the shadows of one of the side passages, and when I lifted my\nhand lamp, there was Ylga.\n\nShe regarded me half-sullenly. \"I have lost my place,\" she said, \"and it\nseems I need never have spoken. She intended to have you all along, and\nit was not a thing like that which could put her off. And you--you just\nthink me officious, if, indeed, you have ever given me another thought\ntill now.\"\n\n\"I never forget a kindness.\"\n\n\"Oh, you will learn that trick soon now. And you are going to marry her,\nyou! The city is ringing with it. I thought at least you were honest,\nbut when there is a high place to be got by merely taking a woman with\nit, you are like the rest. I thought, too, that you would be one of\nthose men who have a distrust for ruddy hair. And, besides she is\nlittle.\"\n\n\"Ylga,\" I said, \"you have taught me that these walls are full of\ncrannies and ears. I will listen to no word against Phorenice. But I\nwould have further converse with you soon. If you still have a kindness\nfor me, go to the chamber that is mine and wait for me there. I will\njoin you shortly.\"\n\nShe drooped her eyes. \"What do you want of me, Deucalion?\"\n\n\"I want to say something to you. You will learn who it concerns later.\"\n\n\"But is it--is it fitting for a maiden to come to a man's room at this\nhour?\"\n\n\"I know little of your conventions here in this new Atlantis. I am\nDeucalion, girl, and if you still have qualms, remembering that, do not\ncome.\"\n\nShe looked up at me with a sneer. \"I was foolish,\" she said. \"My lord's\ncoldness has grown into a proverb, and I should have remembered it. Yes;\nI will come.\"\n\n\"Go now, then,\" said I, and waited till she had passed on ahead and was\nout of sight and hearing. With Ylga to help me, my tasks were somewhat\nlightened, and their sequence changed. In the first instance, now, I\nhad got to make my way with as little delay and show as possible into a\ncertain sanctuary which lay within the temple of our Lady the Moon. And\nhere my knowledge as one of the Seven stood me in high favour.\n\nAll the temples of the city of Atlantis are in immediate and secret\nconnection with the royal pyramid, but the passages are little used,\nseeing that they are known only to the Seven and to the Three above\nthem, supposing that there are three men living at one time sufficiently\nlearned in the highest of the highest mysteries to be installed in that\nsublime degree of the Three. And, even by these, the secret ways may\nonly be used on occasions of the greatest stress, so that a generation\nwell may pass without their being trodden by a human foot.\n\nIt was with some trouble, and after no little experiment that I groped\nmy way into this secret alley; but once there, the rest was easy. I had\nnever trodden it before certainly, but the plan of it had been taught\nme at my initiation as one of the Seven, and the course of the windings\ncame back to me now with easy accuracy. I walked quickly, not only\nbecause the air in those deep crannies is always full of lurking evils,\nbut also because the hours were fleeting, and much must be done before\nour Lord the Sun again rose to make another day.\n\nI came to the spy-place which commands the temple, and found the holy\nplace empty, and, alas! dust-covered, and showing little trace that\nworshippers ever frequented it these latter years. A vast stone of\nthe wall swung outwards and gave me entrance, and presently (after the\nsolemn prayer which is needful before attempting these matters), I took\nthe metal stair from the place where it is kept, and climbed to the\nlap of the Goddess, and then, pulling the stair after me, climbed again\nupwards till my length lay against her calm mysterious face.\n\nA shivering seized me as I thought of what was intended, for even a\nwarrior hardened to horrid sights and deeds may well have qualms when\nhe is called upon to juggle with life and death, and years and history,\nwith the welfare of his country in one hand, and the future of a woman\nwho is as life to him in the other. But again I told myself that\nthe hours flew, and laid hold of the jewel which is studded into the\nforehead of the image with one hand, and then stretching out, thrust at\na corner of the eyebrow with the other. With a faint creak the massive\neyeball below, a stone that I could barely have covered with my back,\nswung inwards. I stepped off the stair, and climbed into the gap. Inside\nwas the chamber which is hollowed from the head of the Goddess.\n\nIt was the first time I had seen this most secret place, but the aspect\nof it was familiar to me from my teaching, and I knew where to find the\nthing which would fill my need. Yet, occupied though I might be with the\nstress of what was to befall, I could not help having a wonder and an\nadmiration for the cleverness with which it was hidden.\n\nHigh as I was in the learning and mysteries of the Priestly Clan, the\nstructure of what I had come to fetch was hidden from me. Beforetime I\nhad known only of their power and effect; and now that I came to handle\nthem, I saw only some roughly rounded balls, like nut kernels, grass\ngreen in colour, and in hardness like the wax of bees. There were three\nof these balls in the hidden place, and I took the one that was needful,\nconcealing the others as I had found them. It may have been a drug, it\nmay have been something more; what exactly it was I did not know; only\nof its power and effect I was sure, as that was set forth plainly in\nthe teaching I had learned; and so I put it in a pouch of my garment,\nreturning by the way I had come, and replacing all things in due order\nbehind me.\n\nOne look I took at the image of the Goddess before I left the temple.\nThe jet of earth-breath which burns eternally from the central altar\nlit her from head to toe, and threw sparkles from the great jewel in\nher forehead. Vast she was, and calm and peaceful beyond all human\nimaginings, a perfect symbolism of that rest and quietness which many\nsigh for so vainly on this rude earth, but which they will never attain\nunless by their piety they earn a place in the hereafter, where our Lady\nthe Moon and the rest of the High Ones reign in Their eternal glorious\nmajesty.\n\nIt was with tired dragging limbs that I made my way back again to the\nroyal pyramid, and at last came to my own private chamber. Ylga awaited\nme there, though at first I did not see her. The suspicions of these\nmodern days had taken a deep hold of the girl, and she must needs crouch\nin hiding till she made sure it was I who came to the chamber, and,\nmoreover, that I came alone.\n\n\"Oh, frown at me if you choose,\" said she sullenly, \"I am past caring\nnow for your good opinion. I had heard so much of Deucalion, and I\nthought I read honesty in you when first you came ashore; but now I know\nthat you are no better than the rest. Phorenice offers you a high place,\nand you marry her blithely to get it. And why, indeed, should you not\nmarry her? People say she is pretty, and I know she can be warm. I have\nseen her warm and languishing to scores of men. She is clever, too, with\nher eyes, is our great Empress; I grant her that. And as for you, it\ntickles you to be courted.\"\n\n\"I think you are a very silly woman,\" I said.\n\n\"If you flatter yourself it matters a rap to me whom you marry, you are\nletting conceit run away with you.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" I said. \"I did not ask you here to make foolish speeches\nwhich seem largely beyond my comprehension. I asked you to help me do a\nservice to one of your own blood-kin.\"\n\nShe stared at me wonderingly. \"I do not understand.\"\n\n\"It rests largely with you as to whether Nais dies to-morrow, or whether\nshe is thrown into a sleep from which she may waken on some later and\nmore happy day.\"\n\n\"Nais!\" she gasped. \"My twin, Nais? She is not here. She is out in\nthe camp with those nasty rebels who bite against the city walls, if,\nindeed, still she lives.\"\n\n\"Nais, your sister is near us in the royal pyramid this minute, and\nunder guard, though where I do not know.\" And with that I told her all\nthat had passed since the girl was brought up a prisoner in the galley\nof that foolish, fawning captain of the port. \"The Empress has decreed\nthat Nais shall be buried alive under a throne of granite which I am to\nbuild for her to-morrow, and buried she will assuredly be. Yet I have a\nkindness for Nais, which you may guess at if you choose, and I am minded\nto send her into a sleep such as only we higher priests know of, from\nwhich at some future day she may possibly awaken.\"\n\n\"So it is Nais; and not Phorenice, and not--not any other?\"\n\n\"Yes; it is Nais. I marry the Empress because Zaemon, who is mouthpiece\nto the High Council of the Priests, has ordered it, for the good of\nAtlantis. But my inwards remain still cold towards her.\"\n\n\"Almost I hate poor Nais already.\"\n\n\"Your vengeance would be easy. Do not tell me where she is gaoled, and I\nshall not dare to ask. Even to give Nais a further span of life I cannot\nrisk making inquiries for her cell, when there is a chance that those\nwho tell me might carry news to the Empress, and so cause more trouble\nfor this poor Atlantis.\"\n\n\"And why should I not carry the news, and so bring myself into favour\nagain? I tell you that being fan-girl to Phorenice and second woman in\nthe kingdom is a thing that not many would cast lightly aside.\"\n\nI looked her between eyes and smiled. \"I have no fear there. You will\nnot betray me, Ylga. Neither will you sell Nais.\"\n\n\"I seem to remember very small love for this same Nais just now,\" she\nsaid bitterly. \"But you are right about that other matter. I shall not\nbuy myself back at your expense. Oh, I am a fool, I know, and you can\ngive me no thanks that I care about, but there is no other way I can\nact.\"\n\n\"Then let us fritter no more time. Go you out now and find where Nais\nis gaoled, and bring me news how I can say ten words to her, and press a\ncertain matter into her clasp.\"\n\nShe bowed her head and left the chamber, and for long enough I was\nalone. I sat down on the couch, and rested wearily against the wall.\nMy bones ached, my eyes ached, and most of all, my inwards ached. I had\nthought to myself that a man who makes his life sufficiently busy\nwill find no leisure for these pains which assault frailer folk; but a\nphilosophy like this, which carried one well in Yucatan, showed poorly\nenough when one tried it here at home. But that there was duty ahead,\nand the order of the High Council to be carried into effect, the\nbleakness of the prospect would have daunted me, and I would have prayed\nthe Gods then to spare me further life, and take me unto Themselves.\n\nYlga came back at last, and I got up and went quickly after her as\nshe led down a maze of passages and alleyways. \"There has been no care\nspared over her guarding,\" she whispered, as we halted once to move a\nstone. \"The officer of the guard is an old lover of mine, and I raised\nhis hopes to the burning point again by a dozen words. But when I wanted\nto see his prisoner, there he was as firm as brass. I told him she was\nmy sister, but that did not move him. I offered him--oh, Deucalion, it\nmakes me blush to think of the things I did offer to that man, but there\nwas no stirring him. He has watched the tormentors so many times, that\nthere is no tempting him into touch of their instruments.\"\n\n\"If you have failed, why bring me out here?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am not inveigling you into a lover's walk with myself, sir. You\ntickle yourself when you think your society is so pleasant as that.\"\n\n\"Come, girl, tell me then what it is. If my temper is short, credit it\nagainst my weariness.\"\n\n\"I have carried out my lord's commands in part. I know the cell where\nNais lives, and I have had speech with her, though not through the door.\nAnd moreover, I have not seen her or touched her hand.\"\n\n\"Your riddles are beyond me, Ylga, but if there is a chance, let us get\non and have this business done.\"\n\n\"We are at the place now,\" said she, with a hard little laugh, \"and if\nyou kneel on the floor, you will find an airshaft, and Nais will answer\nyou from the lower end. For myself, I will leave you. I have a delicacy\nin hearing what you want to say to my sister, Deucalion.\"\n\n\"I thank you,\" I said. \"I will not forget what you have done for me this\nnight.\"\n\n\"You may keep your thanks,\" she said bitterly, and walked away into the\nshadows.\n\nI knelt on the floor of the gallery, and found the air passage with my\nhand, and then, putting my lips to it, whispered for Nais.\n\nThe answer came on the instant, muffled and quiet. \"I knew my lord would\ncome for a farewell.\"\n\n\"What the Empress said, has to be. You understand, my dear? It is for\nAtlantis.\"\n\n\"Have I reproached my lord, by word or glance?\"\n\n\"I myself am bidden to place you in the hollow between the stones, and I\nmust do it.\"\n\n\"Then my last sleep will be a sweet one. I could not ask to be touched\nby pleasanter hands.\"\n\n\"But it mayhap that a day will come when she whom you know of will be\nsuffered by the High Gods to live on this land of Atlantis no longer.\"\n\n\"If my lord will cherish my poor memory when he is free again, I shall\nbe grateful. He might, if he chose, write them on the stones: Here was\nburied a maid who died gladly for the good of Atlantis, even though she\nknew that the man she so dearly loved was husband to her murderess.\"\n\n\"You must not die,\" I whispered. \"My breast is near broken at the very\nthought of it. And for respite, we must trust to the ancient knowledge,\nwhich in its day has been sent out from the Ark of the Mysteries.\"--I\ntook the green waxy ball in my fingers, and stretched them down the\ncrooked air-shaft to the full of my span.--\"I have somewhat for you\nhere. Reach up and try to catch it from me.\"\n\nI heard the faint rustle of her arm as it swept against the masonry, and\nthen the ball was taken over into her grasp. Gods! what a thrill went\nthrough me when the fingers of Nais touched mine! I could not see her,\nbecause of the crookedness of the shaft, but that faint touch of her was\nexquisite.\n\n\"I have it,\" she whispered. \"And what now, dear?\"\n\n\"You will hide the thing in your garment, and when to-morrow the upper\nstone closes down upon you and the light is gone, then you will take it\nbetween your lips and let it dissolve as it will. Sleep will take you,\nmy darling, then, and the High Gods will watch over you, even though\ncenturies pass before you are roused.\"\n\n\"If Deucalion does not wake me, I shall pray never again to open an eye.\nAnd now go, my lord and my dear. They watch me here constantly, and I\nwould not have you harmed by being brought to notice.\"\n\n\"Yes, I must go, my sweetheart. It will not do to have our scheme\nspoiled by a foolish loitering. May the most High Gods attend your rest,\nand if the sacrifice we make finds favour, may They grant us meeting\nhere again on earth before we meet--as we must--when our time is done,\nand They take us up to Their own place.\"\n\n\"Amen,\" she whispered back, and then: \"Kiss your fingers, dear, and\nthrust them down to me.\"\n\nI did that, and for an instant felt her fondle them down the crook of\nthe airshaft out of sight, and then heard her withdraw her little hand\nand kiss it fondly. Then again she kissed her own fingers and stretched\nthem up, and I took up the virtue of that parting kiss on my finger-tips\nand pressed it sacredly to my lips.\n\n\"Living, sleeping, or dead, always my darling,\" she whispered. And then,\nbefore I could answer, she whispered again: \"Go, they are coming for\nme.\" And so I went, knowing that I could do no more to help her then,\nand knowing that all our schemes would be spilt if any eye spied upon me\nas I lay there beside the air shaft. But my chest was like to have split\nwith the dull, helpless anguish that was in it, as I made my way back to\nmy chamber through the mazy alleys of the pyramid.\n\n\"Do not look upon mine eyes, dear, when the time comes,\" had been her\nlast command, \"or they will tell a tale which Phorenice, being a woman,\nwould read. Remember, we make these small denials, not for our own\nlikings, but for Atlantis, which is mother to us all.\"\n\n\n\n\n13. THE BURYING ALIVE OF NAIS\n\n\nThere is no denying that the wishes of Phorenice were carried into quick\neffect in the city of Atlantis. Her modern theory was that the country\nand all therein existed only for the good of the Empress, and when she\nhad a desire, no cost could possibly be too great in its carrying out.\n\nShe had given forth her edict concerning the burying alive of Nais, and\nthough the words were that I was to build the throne of stone, it was an\nunderstood thing that the manual labour was to be done for me by others.\nHeralds made the proclamation in every ward of the city, and masons,\nlabourers, stonecutters, sculptors, engineers, and architects took hands\nfrom whatever was occupying them for the moment, and hastened to the\nrendezvous. The architects chose a chief who gave directions, and the\nlesser architects and the engineers saw these carried into effect. Any\nmaterial within the walls of the city on which they set their seal,\nwas taken at once without payment or compensation; and as the blocks of\nstone they chose were the most monstrous that could be got, they were\nforced to demolish no few buildings to give them passage.\n\nI have before spoken of the modern rage for erecting new palaces and\npyramids, and even though at the moment an army of rebels was battering\nwith war engines at the city walls, the building guilds were steadily\nat work, and their skill (with Phorenice's marvellous invention to aid\nthem) was constantly on the increase. True, they could not move such\nmassive blocks of stone as those which the early Gods planted for the\nsacred circle of our Lord the Sun, but they had got rams and trucks and\ncranes which could handle amazing bulks.\n\nThe throne was to be erected in the open square before the royal\npyramid. Seven tiers of stone were there for a groundwork, each a\nknee-height deep, and each cut in the front with three steps. In the\nuppermost layer was a cavity made to hold the body of Nais, and above\nthis was poised the vast block which formed the seat of the throne\nitself.\n\nThroughout the night, to the light of torches, relay after relay of the\nstonecutters, and the masons, and the sweating labourers had toiled over\nbringing up the stone and dressing it into fit shape, and laying it in\ndue position; and the engineers had built machines for lifting, and the\narchitects had proved that each stone lay in its just and perfect place.\nWhips cracked, and men fainted with the labour, but so soon as one was\nincapable another pressed forward into his place. No delay was brooked\nwhen Phorenice had said her wish.\n\nAnd finally, as the square began to fill with people come to gape at the\npageant of to-day, the chippings and the scaffolding were cleared away,\nand with it the bodies of some half-score of workmen who had died from\naccidents or their exertions during the building, and there stood the\nthrone, splendid in its carvings, and all ready for completion. The\nlower part stood more than two man-heights above the ground, and no\nstone of its courses weighed less than twenty men; the upper part was\ndouble the weight of any of these, and was carved so that the royal\nsnake encircled the chair, and the great hooded head overshadowed it.\nBut at present the upper part was not on its bed, being held up high by\nlifting rams, for what purposes all men knew.\n\nIt was to face this scene, then, that I came out from the royal pyramid\nat the summons of the chamberlains in the cool of next morning. Each\ngreat man who had come there before me had banner-bearers and trumpeters\nto proclaim his presence; the middle classes were in all their bravery\nof apparel; and even poor squalid creatures, with ribs of hunger showing\nthrough their dusty skins, had turbans and wisps of colour wrapped about\ntheir heads to mark the gaiety of the day.\n\nThe trumpets proclaimed my coming, and the people shouted welcome, and\nwith the gorgeous chamberlains walking backwards in advance, I went\nacross to a scarlet awning that had been prepared, and took my seat upon\nthe cushions beneath it.\n\nAnd then came Phorenice, my bride that was to be that day, fresh from\nsleep, and glorious in her splendid beauty. She was borne out from the\npyramid in an open litter of gold and ivory by fantastic savages from\nEurope, her own refinement of feature being thrown up into all the\nhigher relief by contrast with their brutish ugliness. One could hear\nthe people draw a deep breath of delight as their eyes first fell upon\nher; and it is easy to believe there was not a man in that crowd which\nthronged the square who did not envy me her choice, nor was there a\nsoul present (unless Ylga was there somewhere veiled) who could by any\nstretch imagine that I was not overjoyed in winning so lovely a wife.\n\nFor myself, I summoned up all the iron of my training to guard the\nexpression of my face. We were here on ceremonial to-day; a ghastly\nenough affair throughout all its acts, if you choose, but still\nceremonial; and I was minded to show Phorenice a grand manner that would\nleave her nothing to cavil at. After all that had been gone through and\nendured, I did not intend a great scheme to be shattered by letting my\nagony and pain show themselves, in either a shaking hand or a twitching\ncheek. When it came to the point, I told myself, I would lay the living\nbody of my love in the hollow beneath the stone as calmly, and with as\nlittle outward emotion, as though I had been a mere priest carrying out\nthe burial of some dead stranger. And she, on her part, would not,\nI knew, betray our secret. With her, too, it was truly \"Before all\nAtlantis.\"\n\nI think it spared a pang to find that there was to be no mockery or\nflippancy in what went forward. All was solemn and impressive; and,\nthough a certain grandeur and sombreness which bit deep into my breast\nwas lost to the vulgar crowd, I fancy that the outward shape of the\ndouble sacrifice they witnessed that day would not be forgotten by any\nof them, although the inner meaning of it all was completely hidden from\ntheir minds. When it suited her fancy, none could be more strict on the\nritual of a ceremony than this many-mooded Empress, and it appeared\nthat on this occasion she had given command that all things were to be\ncarried out with the rigid exactness and pomp of the older manner.\n\nSo she was borne up by her Europeans to the scarlet awning, and I handed\nher to the ground. She seated herself on the cushions, and beckoned\nme to her side, entwining her fingers with mine as has always been the\ncustom with rulers of Atlantis and their consorts. And there before us\nas we sat, a body of soldiery marched up, and opening out showed Nais\nin their midst. She had a collar of metal round her neck, with chains\ndepending from it firmly held by a brace of guards, so that she should\nnot run in upon the spears of the escort, and thus get a quick and\neasy death, which is often the custom of those condemned to the more\nlingering punishments.\n\nBut it was pleasant to see that she still wore her clothing. Raiment,\nwhether of fabric or skin, has its value, and custom has always given\nthe garments of the condemned to the soldiers guarding them. So as Nais\nwas not stripped, I could not but see that some one had given moneys\nto the guards as a recompense, and in this I thought I saw the hand of\nYlga, and felt a gratitude towards her.\n\nThe soldiers brought her forward to the edge of the pavilion's shade,\nand she was bidden prostrate herself before the Empress, and this she\nwisely did and so avoided rough handling and force. Her face was\npale, but showed neither fear nor defiance, and her eyes were calm\nand natural. She was remembering what was due to Atlantis, and I was\nthrilled with love and pride as I watched her.\n\nBut outwardly I, too, was impassive as a man of stone, and though I knew\nthat Phorenice's eye was on my face, there was never anything on it from\nfirst to last that I would not have had her see.\n\n\"Nais,\" said the Empress, \"you have eaten from my platter when you were\nfan-girl, and drunk from my cup, and what was yours I gave you. You\nshould have had more than gratitude, you should have had knowledge also\nthat the arm of the Empress was long and her hand consummately heavy.\nBut it seems that you have neither of these things. And, moreover, you\nhave tried to take a certain matter that the Empress has set apart for\nherself. You were offered pardon, on terms, and you rejected it. You\nwere foolish. But it is a day now when I am inclined to clemency.\nPresently, seated on that carved throne of granite which he has built me\nyonder, I shall take my Lord Deucalion to husband. Give me a plain word\nthat you are sorry, girl, and name a man whom you would choose, and I\nwill remember the brightness of the occasion, you shall be pardoned and\nwed before we rise from these cushions.\"\n\n\"I will not wed,\" she said quietly.\n\n\"Think for the last time, Nais, of what is the other choice. You will\nbe taken, warm, and quick, and beautiful as you stand there this minute,\nand laid in the hollow place that is made beneath the throne-stone.\nDeucalion, that is to be my husband, will lay you in that awful bed, as\na symbol that so shall perish all Phorenice's enemies, and then he will\nrelease the rams and lower the upper stone into place, and the world\nshall see your face no more. Look at the bright sky, Nais, fill your\nchest with the sweet warm air, and then think of what this death will\nmean. Believe me, girl, I do not want to make you an example unless you\nforce me.\"\n\n\"I will not wed,\" said the prisoner quietly.\n\nThe Empress loosed her fingers from my arm, and lay back against the\ncushions. \"If the girl presumes on our old familiarity, or thinks that I\njest, show her now, Deucalion, that I do not.\"\n\n\"The Empress is far from jesting,\" I said. \"I will do this thing because\nit is the wish of the Empress that it should be done, and because it is\nthe command of the Empress that a symbol of it shall remain for ever as\nan example for others. Lead your prisoner to the place.\"\n\nThe soldiers wheeled, and the two guards with the chains of the collar\nwhich was on the neck of Nais prepared to put out force to drag her\nup the steps. But she walked with them willingly, and with a colour\nunchanged, and I rose from my seat, and made obeisance to the Empress\nand followed them.\n\nBefore all those ten thousand eyes, we two made no display of emotion\nthen, not only for Atlantis' sake, but also because both Nais and I had\na nicety and a pride in our natures. We were not as Phorenice to flaunt\nendearments before others.\n\nYet, when I had bidden the guards unhasp the collar which held the\nprisoner's neck, and clapped my arms around her, showing all the\nroughness of one who has no mind that his captive shall escape or even\nunduly struggle, a thrill gushed through me so potent that I was like\nto have fainted, and it was only by supreme strain of will that I held\nunbrokenly on with the ceremonial. I, who had never embraced a woman\nwith aught but the arm of roughness before, now held pressed to me one\nwhom I loved with an infinite tenderness, and the revelation of how love\ncan come out and link with love was almost my undoing. Yet, outwardly,\nNais made so sign, but lay half-strangled in my arms, as any woman does\nthat is being borne away by a spoiler.\n\nI trod with her to the uppermost step, the vast throne-stone overhanging\nus, and then so that all of those who were gazing from the sides of the\npyramids and the roofs of the buildings round might see, though we were\nbeyond Phorenice's view, I used a force that was brutal in dragging her\nacross the level, and putting her down into the hollow. And yet the girl\nresisted me with no one effort whatever.\n\nSo that the victim might not struggle out and be crushed, and so gain\nan easy death when the stone descended, there were brazen clamps to fit\ninto grooves of the stones above the hollow where she lay, and these I\nfitted in place above her, and fastened one by one, doing this butcher's\nwork with one hand, and still fiercely holding her down by the other.\nGods! and the sweat of agony dripped from me on to the thirsty stone as\nI worked. I could not keep that in.\n\nI clamped and locked the last two bars in place, and took my brute's\nhand away from her throat.\n\nThe hateful fingermarks showed as bloodless furrows in the whiteness\nof her skin. For the life of me, yes, even for the fate of Atlantis, I\ncould not help dropping my glance upon her face. But she was stronger\nthan I. She gave me no last look. She kept her eyes steadfastly fixed on\nthe cruel stone above, and so I left her, knowing that it was best not\nto tarry longer.\n\nI came out from under the stone, and gave the sign to the engineers who\nstood by the rams. The fires were taken away from their sides, and\nthe metal in them began to contract, and slowly the vast bulk of the\nthrone-stone began to creep down towards its bed.\n\nBut ah, so slowly! Gods! how my soul was torn as I watched and waited.\n\nYet I kept my face impassive, overlooking as any officer might a piece\nof work which others were carrying out under his direction, and on which\nhis credit rested; and I stood gravely in my place till the rams had\nlet the stone come down on its final resting place, and had been carried\naway by the engineers; and then I went round with the master architect\nwith his plumbline and level, whilst he tested this last piece of the\nbuilding and declared it perfect.\n\nIt was a useless form, this last, seeing that by calculation they knew\nexactly how the stone must rest; but the guilds have their forms\nand customs, and on these occasions of high ceremonial, they are\npunctiliously carried out, because these middle-class people wish always\nto appear mysterious and impressive to the poor vulgar folk who are\ntheir inferiors. But perhaps I am hard there on them. A man who is\nneedlessly taken round to plumb and duly level the tomb where his love\nlies buried living, may perhaps be excused by the assessors on high a\nlittle spirit of bitterness.\n\nI had gone up the steps to do my hateful work a man full of grief,\nthough outwardly unmoved. As I came down again I had a feeling of\nincompleteness; it seemed as though half my inwards had been left behind\nwith Nais in the hollow of the stone, and their place was taken by a\nvoid which ached wearily; but still I carried a passive face, and memory\nthat before all these private matters stood the command of the High\nCouncil, which sat before the Ark of the Mysteries.\n\nSo I went and stood before Phorenice, and said the words which the\nancient forms prescribed concerning the carrying out of her wish.\n\n\"Then, now,\" she said, \"I will give myself to you as wife. We are not as\nothers, you and I, Deucalion. There is a law and a form set down for\nthe marrying of these other people, but that would be useless for our\npurposes. We will have neither priest nor scribe to join us and set down\nthe union. I am the law here in Atlantis, and you soon will be part of\nme. We will not be demeaned by profaner hands. We will make the ceremony\nfor ourselves, and for witnesses, there are sufficient in waiting.\nAfterwards, the record shall be cut deep in the granite throne you have\nbuilt for me, and the lettering filled in with gold, so that it shall\nendure and remain bright for always.\"\n\n\"The Empress can do no wrong,\" I said formally, and took the hand she\noffered me, and helped her to rise. We walked out from the scarlet\nawning into the glare of the sunshine, she leaning on me, flushing, and\nso radiantly lovely that the people began to hail her with rapturous\nshouts of \"A Goddess; our Goddess Phorenice.\" But for me they had no\nwelcoming word. I think the set grimness of my face both scared and\nrepelled them.\n\nWe went up the steps which led to the throne, the people still shouting,\nand I sat her in the royal seat beneath the snake's outstretched head,\nand she drew me down to sit beside her.\n\nShe raised her jewelled hand, and a silence fell on that great throng,\nas though the breath had been suddenly cut short for all of them.\n\nThen Phorenice made proclamation:\n\n\"Hear me, O my people, and hear me, O High Gods from whom I am come.\nI take this man Deucalion, to be my husband, to share with me the\nprosperity of Atlantis, and join me in guarding our great possession.\nMay all our enemies perish as she is now perishing above whom we sit.\"\nAnd then she put her arms around my neck, and kissed me hotly on the\nmouth.\n\nIn turn I also spoke: \"Hear me, O most High Gods, whose servant I am,\nand hear me also, O ye people. I take this Empress, Phorenice, to\nwife, to help with her the prosperity of Atlantis, and join with her in\nguarding the welfare of that great possession. May all the enemies of\nthis country perish as they have perished in the past.\"\n\nAnd then, I too, who had not been permitted by the fate to touch the\nlips of my love, bestowed the first kiss I had ever given woman to\nPhorenice, that was now being made my wife.\n\nBut we were not completely linked yet.\n\n\"A woman is one, and man is one,\" she proclaimed, following for the\nfirst time the old form of words, \"but in marriage they merge, so that\nwife and husband are no more separate, but one conjointly. In token of\nthis we will now make the symbolic joining together, so that all may see\nand remember.\" She took her dagger, and pricking the brawn on my forearm\ntill a head of blood appeared, set her red lips to it, and took it into\nherself.\n\n\"Ah,\" she said, with her eyes sparkling, \"now you are part of me indeed,\nDeucalion, and I feel you have strengthened me already.\" She pulled down\nthe neck of her robe. \"Let me make you my return.\"\n\nI pricked the rounded whiteness of her shoulder. Gods! when I remembered\nwho was beneath us as we sat on that throne, I could have driven the\nblade through to her heart! And then I, too, put down my lips, and took\nthe drop of her blood that was yielded to me.\n\nMy tongue was dry, my throat was parched, and my face suffused, and I\nthought I should have choked.\n\nBut the Empress, who was ordinarily so acute, was misled then. \"It\nthrills you?\" she cried. \"It burns within you like living fire? I have\njust felt it. By my face! Deucalion, if I had known the pleasure it\ngives to be made a wife, I do not think I should have waited this long\nfor you. Ah, yes; but with another man I should have had no thrill. I\nmight have gone through the ceremony with another, but it would have\nleft me cold. Well, they say this feeling comes to a woman but once in\nher time, and I would not change it for the glory of all my conquests\nand the whirl of all my power.\" She leaned in close to me so that the\nred curls of her hair swept my cheek, and her breath came hot against my\nmouth. \"Tasted you ever any sweet so delicious as this knowledge that we\nare made one now, Deucalion, past all possible dissolving?\"\n\nI could not lie to her any more just then. The Gods know how honestly I\nhad striven to play the part commanded me for Atlantis' good, but there\nis a limit to human endurance, and mine was reached. I was not all anger\ntowards her. I had some pity for this passion of hers, which had grown\nof itself certainly, but which I had done nothing to check; and the\nindecent frankness with which it was displayed was only part of the\nlivery of potentates who flaunt what meaner folk would coyly hide. But\nalways before my eyes was a picture of the girl on whom her jealousy had\ntaken such a bitter vengeance, and to invent spurious lover's talk then\nwas a thing my tongue refused to do.\n\n\"Words are poor things,\" I said, \"and I am a man unused to women, and\nhave but a small stock of any phrases except the dryest. Remember,\nPhorenice, a week agone, I did not know what love was, and now that I\nhave learned the lesson, somewhat of the suddenest, the language remains\nstill to come to me. My inwards speak; indeed they are full of speech;\nbut I cannot translate into bald cold words what they say.\"\n\nAnd here, surely the High Gods took pity on my tied tongue and my\nmisery, and made an opportunity for bringing the ceremony to an end. A\nman ran into the square shouting, and showing a wound that dripped,\nand presently all that vast crowd which stood on the pavements, and the\nsides of the pyramids, and the roofs of the temples, took up the cry,\nand began to feel for their weapons.\n\n\"The rebels are in!\" \"They have burrowed a path into the city!\" \"They\nhave killed the cave-tigers and taken a gate!\" \"They are putting the\nwhole place to the storm!\" \"They will presently leave no poor soul of us\nhere alive!\"\n\nThere then was a termination of our marriage cooings. With rebels merely\nbiting at the walls, it was fine to put strong trust in the defences,\nand easy to affect contempt for the besiegers' powers, and to keep\nthe business of pageants and state craft and marryings turning on easy\nwheels. But with rebel soldiers already inside the city (and hordes of\nothers doubtless pressing on their heels), the affairs took a different\nlight. It was no moment for further delay, and Phorenice was the first\nto admit it. The glow that had been in her eyes changed to the glare of\nthe fighter, as the fellow who had run up squalled out his tidings.\n\nI stood and stretched my chest. I seemed in need of air. \"Here,\" I said,\n\"is work that I can understand more clearly. I will go and sweep this\nrabble back to their burrows, Phorenice.\"\n\n\"But not alone, sir. I come too. It is my city still. Nay, sir, we are\ntoo newly wed to be parted yet.\"\n\n\"Have your will,\" I said, and together we went down the steps of the\nthrone to the pavement below. Under my breath I said a farewell to Nais.\n\nOur armour-bearers met us with weapons, and we stepped into litters, and\nthe slaves took us off hot foot. The wounded man who had first brought\nthe news had fallen in a faint, and no more tidings was to be got from\nhim, but the growing din of the fight gave us the general direction, and\npresently we began to meet knots of people who dwelt near the place of\nirruption, running away in wild panic, loaded down with their household\ngoods.\n\nIt was useless to stop these, as fight they could not, and if they had\nstayed they would merely have been slaughtered like flies, and would\nin all likelihood have impeded our own soldiery. And so we let them run\nscreaming on their blind way, but forced the litters through them with\nbut very little regard for their coward convenience.\n\nNow the advantage of the rebels, when it came to be looked upon by a\nsoldier's eye, was a thing of little enough importance. They had driven\na tunnel from behind a covering mound, beneath the walls, and had opened\nit cleverly enough through the floor of a middle-class house. They had\ncome through into this, collecting their numbers under its shelter, and\ndoubtless hoping that the marriage of the Empress (of which spies had\ngiven them information) would sap the watchfulness of the city guards.\nBut it seems they were discovered and attacked before they were\nthoroughly ready to emerge, and, as a fine body of troops were barracked\nnear the spot, their extermination would have been merely a matter of\ntime, even if we had not come up.\n\nIt did not take a trained eye long to decide on this, and Phorenice,\nwith a laugh, lay back on the cushions of the litter, and returned her\nweapons to the armour-bearer who came panting up to receive them. \"We\ngrow nervous with our married life, my Deucalion,\" she said. \"We are\nfearful lest this new-found happiness be taken from us too suddenly.\"\n\nBut I was not to be robbed of my breathing-space in this wise. \"Let me\ncrave a wedding gift of you,\" I said.\n\n\"It is yours before you name it.\"\n\n\"Then give me troops, and set me wide a city gate a mile away from\nhere.\"\n\n\"You can gather five hundred as you go from here to the gate, taking two\nhundred of those that are here. If you want more, they must be fetched\nfrom other barracks along the walls. But where is your plan?\"\n\n\"Why, my poor strategy teaches me this: these foolish rebels have set\nall their hopes on this mine, and all their excitement on its present\nsuccess. If they are kept occupied here by a Phorenice, who will give\nthem some dainty fighting without checking them unduly, they will press\non to the attack and forget all else, and never so much as dream of a\nsortie. And meanwhile, a Deucalion with his troop will march out of the\ncity well away from here, without tuck of drum or blare of trumpet, and\nfall most unpleasantly upon their rear. After which, a Phorenice will\nburn the house here at the mine's head, which is of wood, and straw\nthatched, to discourage further egress, and either go to the walls to\nwatch the fight from there, or sally out also and spur on the rout as\nher fancy dictates.\"\n\n\"Your scheme is so pretty, I would I could rob you of it for my own\ncredit's sake, and as it is, I must kiss you for your cleverness. But\nyou got my word first, you naughty fellow, and you shall have the men\nand do as you ask. Eh, sir, this is a sad beginning of our wedded life,\nif you begin to rob your little wife of all the sweets of conquest from\nthe outset.\"\n\nShe took back the weapons and target she had given to the armour-bearer,\nand stepped over the side of the litter to the ground. \"But at least,\"\nshe said, \"if you are going to fight, you shall have troops that will do\ncredit to my drill,\" and thereupon proceeded to tell off the companies\nof men-at-arms who were to accompany me. She left herself few enough to\nstem the influx of rebels who poured ceaselessly in through the\ntunnel; but as I had seen, with Phorenice, heavy odds added only to her\nenjoyment.\n\nBut for the Empress, I will own at the time to have given little enough\nof thought. My own proper griefs were raw within me, and I thirsted for\nthat forgetfulness of all else which battle gives, so that for awhile I\nmight have a rest from their gnawings.\n\nIt made my blood run freer to hear once more the tramp of practised\ntroops behind me, and when all had been collected, we marched out\nthrough a gate of the city, and presently were charging through and\nthrough the straggling rear of the enemy. By the Gods! for the moment\neven Nais was blotted from my wearied mind. Never had I loved more to\nlet my fierceness run madly riot. Never have I gloated more abundantly\nover the terrible joy of battle.\n\nNais must forgive my weakness in seeking to forget her even for a\nbreathing-space. Had that opportunity been denied me, I believe the\nagony of remembering would have snapped my brain-strings for always.\n\n\n\n\n14. AGAIN THE GODS MAKE CHANGE\n\n\nNow it would be tedious to tell how with a handful of highly trained\nfighting men, I charged and recharged, and finally broke up that horde\nof rebels which outnumbered us by fifteen times. It must be remembered\nthat they grew suddenly panic-stricken in finding that of all those\nwho went in under the city walls by the mine on which they had set such\ngreat store, none came back, and that the sounds of panic which had\nfirst broken out within the city soon gave way to cries of triumph and\njoy. And it must be carried in memory also that these wretched rebels\nwere without training worthy of the name, were for the most part\nweaponed very vilely, and, seeing that their silly principles made each\nthe equal of his neighbour, were practically without heads or leaders\nalso.\n\nSo when the panic began, it spread like a malignant murrain through all\ntheir ragged ranks, and there were none to rally the flying, none to\ndirect those of more desperate bravery who stayed and fought.\n\nMy scheme of attack was simple. I hunted them without a halt. I and my\nfellows never stopped to play the defensive. We turned one flank, and\ncharged through a centre, and then we were harrying the other flank,\nand once more hacking our passage through the solid mass. And so by\nconstantly keeping them on the run, and in ignorance of whence would\ncome the next attack, panic began to grow amongst them and ferment, till\npresently those in the outer lines commenced to scurry away towards\nthe forests and the spoiled corn-lands of the country, and those in the\ninner packs were only wishful of a chance to follow them.\n\nIt was no feat of arms this breaking up of the rebel leaguer, and no\npractised soldier would wish to claim it as such. It was simply taking\nadvantage of the chances of the moment, and as such it was successful.\nGiven an open battle on their own ground, these desperate rebels would\nhave fought till none could stand, and by sheer ferocious numbers\nwould have pulled down any trained troops that the city could have sent\nagainst them, whether they had advanced in phalanx or what formation\nyou will. For it must be remembered they were far removed from cowards,\nbeing Atlantean all, just as were those within the city, and were,\nmoreover, spurred to extraordinary savageness and desperation by the\noppression under which they had groaned, and the wrongs they had been\nforced to endure.\n\nStill, as I say, the poor creatures were scattered, and the siege was\nraised from that moment, and it was plain to see that the rebellion\nmight be made to end, if no unreasonable harshness was used for its\nfinal suppression. Too great severity, though perhaps it may be justly\ntheir portion, only drives such malcontents to further desperations.\n\nNow, following up these fugitives, to make sure that there was no halt\nin their retreat, and to send the lesson of panic thoroughly home to\nthem, had led us a long distance from the city walls; and as we had\nfought all through the burning heat of the day and my men were heavily\nwearied, I decided to halt where we were for the night amongst\nsome half-ruined houses which would make a temporary fortification.\nFortunately, a drove of little cloven-hoofed horses which had been\nscared by some of the rebels in their flight happened to blunder into\nour lines, and as we killed five before they were clear again, there was\na soldier's supper for us, and quickly the fires were lit and cooking\nit.\n\nSentries paced the outskirts and made their cries to one another, and\nthe wounded sat by the fires and dressed their hurts, and with the\nofficers I talked over the engagements of the day, and the methods of\neach charge, and the other details of the fighting. It is the special\nperquisite of soldiers to dally over these matters with gusto, though\nthey are entirely without interest for laymen.\n\nThe hour drew on for sleep, and snores went up from every side. It was\nclear that all my officers were wearied out, and only continued the\ntalk through deference to their commander. Yet I had a feverish dread\nof being left alone again with my thoughts, and pressed them on with\nconversation remorselessly. But in the end they were saved the rudeness\nof dropping off into unconsciousness during my talk. A sentry came up\nand saluted. \"My lord,\" he reported, \"there is a woman come up from the\ncity whom we have caught trying to come into the bivouac.\"\n\n\"How is she named?\"\n\n\"She will not say.\"\n\n\"Has she business?'\n\n\"She will say none. She demands only to see my lord.\"\n\n\"Bring her here to the fire,\" I ordered, and then on second thoughts\nremembering that the woman, whoever she might be, had news likely enough\nfor my private ear (or otherwise she would not have come to so uncouth\na rendezvous), I said to the sentry: \"Stay,\" and got up from the ground\nbeside the fire, and went with him to the outer line.\n\n\"Where is she?\" I asked.\n\n\"My comrades are holding her. She might be a wench belonging to these\nrebels, with designs to put a knife into my lord's heart, and then we\nsentries would suffer. The Empress,\" he added simply, \"seems to set\ngood store upon my lord at present, and we know the cleverness of her\ntormentors.\"\n\n\"Your thoughtfulness is frank,\" I said, and then he showed me the woman.\nShe was muffled up in hood and cloak, but one who loved Nais as I loved\ncould not mistake the form of Ylga, her twin sister, because of mere\nswathings. So I told the sentries to release her without asking her for\nspeech, and then led her out from the bivouac beyond earshot of their\nlines.\n\n\"It is something of the most pressing that has brought you out here,\nYlga?\"\n\n\"You know me, then? There must be something warmer than the ordinary\nbetween us two, Deucalion, if you could guess who walked beneath all\nthese mufflings.\"\n\nI let that pass. \"But what's your errand, girl?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" she said bitterly, \"there's my reward. All your concern's for the\nmessage, none for the carrier. Well, good my lord, you are husband to\nthe dainty Phorenice no longer.\"\n\n\"This is news.\"\n\n\"And true enough, too. She will have no more of you, divorces you,\nspurns you, thrusts you from her, and, after the first splutter of wrath\nis done, then come pains and penalties.\"\n\n\"The Empress can do no wrong. I will have you speak respectful words of\nthe Empress.\"\n\n\"Oh, be done with that old fable! It sickens me. The woman was mad for\nlove of you, and now she's mad with jealousy. She knows that you gave\nNais some of your priest's magic, and that she sleeps till you choose to\ncome and claim her, even though the day be a century from this. And if\nyou wish to know the method of her enlightenment, it is simple. There\nis another airshaft next to the one down which you did your cooing and\nbilling, and that leads to another cell in which lay another prisoner.\nThe wretch heard all that passed, and thought to buy enlargement by\ntelling it.\n\n\"But his news came a trifle stale. It seems that with the pressure of\nthe morning's ceremonies, they forgot to bring a ration, and when at\nlast his gaoler did remember him, it was rather late, seeing that by\nthen Phorenice had tied herself publicly to a husband, and poor Nais had\ndoubtless eaten her green drug. However, the fools must needs try and\nbarter his tale for what it would fetch; and, as was natural, had such\na silly head chopped off for his pains; and after that your Phorenice\nbehaved as you may guess. And now you may thank me, sir, for coming to\nwarn you not to go back to Atlantis.\"\n\n\"But I shall go back. And if the Empress chooses to cut my head also\nfrom its proper column, that is as the High Gods will.\"\n\n\"You are more sick of life than I thought. But I think, sir, our\nPhorenice judges your case very accurately. It was permitted me to hear\nthe outbursting of this lady's rage. 'Shall I hew off his head?' said\nshe. 'Pah! Shall I give him over to my tormentors, and stand by whilst\nthey do their worst? He would not wrinkle his brow at their fiercest\nefforts. No; he must have a heavier punishment than any of these, and\none also which will endure. I shall lop off his right hand and his left\nfoot, so that he may be a fighting man no longer, and then I shall drive\nhim forth crippled into the dangerous lands, where he may learn Fear.\nThe beasts shall hunt him, the fires of the ground shall spoil his rest.\nHe shall know hunger, and he shall breathe bad air. And all the while he\nshall remember that I have Nais near me, living and locked in her coffin\nof stone, to play with as I choose, and to give over to what insults may\ncome to my fancy.' That is what she said, Deucalion. Now I ask you again\nwill you go back to meet her vengeance?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"it is no part of my plan to be mutilated and left to\nlive.\"\n\n\"So, being a woman of some sense, I judged. And, moreover, having some\nsmall kindness still left for you, I have taken it upon myself to make\na plan for your further movement which may fall in with your whim. Does\nthe name of Tob come back to your memory?\"\n\n\"One who was Captain of Tatho's navy?\"\n\n\"That same Tob. A gruff, rude fellow, and smelling vile of tar, but\nseeming to have a sturdy honesty of his own. Tob sails away this night\nfor parts unknown, presumably to found a kingdom with Tob for king. It\nseems he can find little enough to earn at his craft in Atlantis these\nlatter days, and has scruples at seeing his wife and young ones hungry.\nHe told me this at the harbour side when I put my neck under the axe by\nsaying I wanted carriage for you, sir, and so having me under his thumb,\nhe was perhaps more loose-lipped than usual. You seem to have made\na fine impression on Tob, Deucalion. He said--I repeat his hearty\ndisrespect--you were just the recruit he wanted, but whether you joined\nhim or not, he would go to the nether Gods to do you service.\"\n\n\"By the fellow's side, I gained some experience in fighting the greater\nsea beasts.\"\n\n\"Well, go and do it again. Believe me, sir, it is your only chance. It\nwould grieve me much to hear the searing-iron hiss on your stumps. I\nbargained with Tob to get clear of the harbour forts before the chain\nwas up for the night, and as he is a very daring fellow, with no fear of\nnavigating under the darkness, he himself said he would come to a point\nof the shore which we agreed upon, and there await you. Come, Deucalion,\nlet me lead you to the place.\"\n\n\"My girl,\" I said, \"I see I owe you many thanks for what you have done\non my poor behalf.\"\n\n\"Oh, your thanks!\" she said. \"You may keep them. I did not come out here\nin the dark and the dangers for mere thanks, though I knew well enough\nthere would be little else offered.\"--She plucked at my sleeve.--\"Now\nshow me your walking pace, sir. They will begin to want your countenance\nin the camp directly, and we need hanker after no too narrow inquiries\nfor what's along.\"\n\nSo thereon we set off, Ylga and I, leaving the lights of the bivouac\nbehind us, and she showed the way, whilst I carried my weapons ready to\nward off attacks whether from beasts or from men. Few words were passed\nbetween us, except those which had concern with the dangers natural\nto the way. Once only did we touch one another, and that was where\na tree-trunk bridged a rivulet of scalding water which flowed from a\nboil-spring towards the sea.\n\n\"Are you sure of footing?\" I asked, for the night was dark, and the heat\nof the water would peel the flesh from the bones if one slipped into it.\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"I am not,\" and reached out and took my hand. I helped\nher over and then loosed my grip, and she sighed, and slowly slipped her\nhand away. Then on again we went in silence, side by side, hour after\nhour, and league after league.\n\nBut at last we topped a rise, and below us through the trees I could see\nthe gleam of the great estuary on which the city of Atlantis stands. The\nground was soggy and wet beneath us, the trees were full of barbs and\nspines, the way was monstrous hard. Ylga's breath was beginning to come\nin laboured pants. But when I offered to take her arm, and help her,\nas some return against what she had done for me, she repulsed me rudely\nenough. \"I am no poor weakling,\" said she, \"if that is your only reason\nfor wanting to touch me.\"\n\nPresently, however, we came out through the trees, and the roughest part\nof our journey was done. We saw the ship riding to her anchors in\nshore a mile away, and a weird enough object she was under the faint\nstarlight. We made our way to her along the level beaches.\n\nTob was keeping a keen watch. We were challenged the moment we came\nwithin stone or arrow shot, and bidden to halt and recite our business;\nbut he was civil enough when he heard we were those whom he expected.\nHe called a crew and slacked out his anchor-rope till his ship ground\nagainst the shingle, and then thrust out his two steering oars to help\nus clamber aboard.\n\nI turned to Ylga with words of thanks and farewell. \"I will never forget\nwhat you have done for me this night; and should the High Gods see fit\nto bring me back to Atlantis and power, you shall taste my gratitude.\"\n\n\"I do not want to return. I am sick of this old life here.\"\n\n\"But you have your palace in the city, and your servants, and your\nwealth, and Phorenice will not disturb you from their possession.\"\n\n\"Oh, as for that, I could go back and be fan-girl tomorrow. But I do not\nwant to go back.\"\n\n\"Let me tell you it is no time for a gently nurtured lady like yourself\nto go forward. I have been viceroy of Yucatan, Ylga, and know somewhat\nof making a foothold in these new countries. And that was nothing\ncompared with what this will be. I tell you it entails hardships, and\nprivations, and sufferings which you could not guess at. Few survive\nwho go to colonise in the beginning, and those only of the hardiest, and\nthey earn new scars and new batterings every day.\"\n\n\"I do not care, and, besides, I can share the work. I can cook, I can\nshoot a good arrow, and I can make garments, yes, though they were\ncut from the skins of beasts and had to be sewn with backbone sinews.\nBecause you despise fine clothes, and because you have seen me only\ndecked out as fan-girl, you think I am useless. Bah, Deucalion! Never\nlet people prate to me about your perfection. You know less about a\nwoman than a boy new from school.\"\n\n\"I have learned all I care to know about one woman, and because of the\nmemory of her, I could not presume to ask her sister to come with me\nnow.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" she said bitterly, \"kick my pride. I knew well enough it was only\nsecond place to Nais I could get all the time I was wanting to come. Yet\nno one but a boor would have reminded me of it. Gods! and to think that\nhalf the men in Atlantis have courted me, and now I am arrived at this!\"\n\n\"I must go alone. It would have made me happier to take your esteem with\nme. But as it is, I suppose I shall carry only your hate.\"\n\n\"That is the most humiliating thing of all; I cannot bring myself to\nhate you. I ought to, I know, after the brutal way you have scorned me.\nBut I do not, and there is the truth. I seem to grow the fonder of you,\nand if I thought there was a way of keeping you alive, and unmutilated,\nhere in Atlantis, I do not think I should point out that Tob is tired\nof waiting, and will probably be off without you.\" She flung her arms\nsuddenly about my neck, and kissed me hotly on the mouth. \"There, that\nis for good-bye, dear. You see I am reckless. I care not what I do now,\nknowing that you cannot despise me more than you have done all along for\nmy forwardness.\"\n\nShe ran back from me into the edge of the trees.\n\n\"But this is foolishness,\" I said. \"I must take you through the dangers\nthat lie between here and some gate of the city, and then come back to\nthe ship.\"\n\n\"You need not fear for me. The unhappy are always safe. And, besides, I\nhave a way. It is my solace to know that you will remember me now. You\nwill never forget that kiss.\"\n\n\"Fare you well, Ylga,\" I cried. \"May the High Gods keep you entirely in\ntheir holy care.\"\n\nBut no reply came back. She had gone off into the forest. And so I\nturned down to the beach, and splashed into the water, and climbed on\nboard the ship up the steering oars. Tob gave the word to haul-to the\nanchor, and get her away from the beach.\n\n\"Greeting, my lord,\" said he, \"but I'd have been pleased to see you\nearlier. We've small enough force and slow enough heels in this vessel,\nand it's my idea that the sooner we're away from here and beyond range\nof pursuit, the safer it will be for my woman and brats who are in that\nhutch of an after-castle. It's long enough since I sailed in such a\nsmall old-fashioned ship as this. She's no machines, and she's not even\na steering mannikin. Look at the meanness of her furniture and (in your\near) I've suspicions that there's rottenness in her bottom. But she's\nthe best I'd the means to buy, and if she reaches the place at the\nfarther end I've got my eye on, we shall have to make a home there, or\nbe content to die, for she'll never have strength to carry us farther\nor back. She's been a ship in the Egypt trade, and you know what that is\nfor getting worm and rot in the wood.\"\n\n\"You'd enough hands for your scheme before I came?\"\n\n\"Oh yes. I've fifty stout lads and eight women packed in the ship\nsomehow, and trouble enough I've had to get them away from the city.\nThat thief of a port-captain wellnigh skinned us clean before he could\nsee it lawful that so many useful fighting men might go out of harbour.\nTimes are not what they were, I tell you, and the sea trade's about\ndone. All sailor men of any skill have taken a woman or two and gone\nout in companies to try their fortunes in other lands. Why, I'd trouble\nenough to get half a score to help me work this ship. All my balance are\njust landsmen raw and simple, and if I land half of them alive at the\nother end, we shall be doing well.\"\n\n\"Still with luck and a few good winds it should not take long to get\nacross to Europe.\"\n\nTob slapped his leg. \"No savage Europe for me, my lord. Now, see the\nadvantage of being a mariner. I found once some islands to the north\nof Europe, separated from the main by a strait, which I called the Tin\nIslands, seeing that tin ore litters many of the beaches. I was driven\nthere by storm, and said no word of the find when I got back, and here\nyou see it comes in useful. There's no one in all Atlantis but me knows\nof those Tin Islands to-day, and we'll go and fight honestly for our\nground, and build a town and a kingdom on it.\"\n\n\"With Tob for king?\"\n\n\"Well, I have figured it out as such for many a day, but I know when I\nmeet my better, and I'm content to serve under Deucalion. My lord would\nhave done wiser to have brought a wife with him, though, and I thought\nit was understood by the good lady that spoke to me down at the harbour,\nor I'd have mentioned it earlier. The savages in my Tin Islands go naked\nand stain themselves blue with woad, and are very filthy and brutish to\nlook upon. They are sturdy, and should make good slaves, but one would\nhave to get blunted in the taste before one could wish to be father to\ntheir children.\"\n\n\"I am still husband to Phorenice.\"\n\nTob grinned. \"The Gods give you joy of her. But it is part of a\nmariner's creed--and you will grow to be a mariner here--that wedlock\ndoes not hold across the seas. However, that matter may rest. But,\ncoming to my Tin Islands again: they'll delight you. And I tell you, a\nkingdom will not be so hard to carve out as it was in Egypt, or as you\nfound in Yucatan. There are beasts there, of course, and no one who\ncan hunt need ever go hungry. But the greater beasts are few. There\nare cave-bears and cave-tigers in small numbers, to be sure, and some\nriver-horses and great snakes. But the greater lizards seem to avoid the\nland; and as for birds, there is rarely seen one that can hurt a grown\nman. Oh, I tell you, it will be a most desirable kingdom.\"\n\n\"Tob seems to have imagined himself king of the Tin Islands with much\nreality.\"\n\nHe sighed a little. \"In truth I did, and there is no denying it, and I\ntell you plain, there is not another man living that I would have broken\nthis voyage for but Deucalion. But don't think I regret it, and don't\nthink I want to push myself above my place. This breeze and the ebb are\ntaking the old ship finely along her ways. See those fire baskets on the\nharbour forts? We're abreast of them now. We'll have dropped them and\nthe city out of sight by daylight, and the flood will not begin to run\nup till then. But I fear unless the wind hardens down with the dawn\nwe'll have to bring up to an anchor when the flood makes. Tides run very\nhard in these narrow seas. Aye, and there are some shrewdish tide-rips\nround my Tin Islands, as you shall see when we reach them.\"\n\nThere were many fearful glances backwards when day came and showed the\nwaters, and the burning mountains that hemmed them in beyond the shores.\nAll seemed to expect some navy of Phorenice to come surging up to take\nthem back to servitude and starvation in the squalid wards of the city;\nand I confess ingenuously that I was with them in all truth when they\nswore they would fight the ship till she sank beneath them, before they\nwould obey another of the commands of Phorenice. However, their brave\nheroics were displayed to no small purpose. For the full flow of the\ntide we hung in our place, barely moving past the land, but yet not\nseeing either oar or sail; and then, when the tide turned, away we went\nonce more with speed, mightily comforted.\n\nTob's woman must needs bring drink on deck, and bid all pour libations\nto her as a future queen. But Tob cuffed her back into the after-castle,\nslamming to the hatch behind her heels, and bidding the crew send the\nliquor down their dusty throats. \"We are done with that foolery,\" said\nhe. \"My Lord Deucalion will be king of this new kingdom we shall\nbuild in the Tin Islands, and a right proper king he'll make, as you\nuntravelled ones would know, if you'd sailed the outer seas with him as\nI have done.\" Beneath which I read a regret, but said nothing, having\nmade my plans from the moment of stepping on board, as will appear on a\nlater sheet.\n\nSo on down the great estuary we made our way, and though it pleasured\nthe others on board when they saw that the seas were desolate of sails,\nit saddened me when I recalled how once the waters had been whitened\nwith the glut of shipping.\n\nThey had started off on their voyage with a bare two days' provision\nin their equipment, and so, of necessity even after leaving the great\nestuary, we were forced to voyage coastwise, putting into every likely\nriver and sheltered beach to slay fish and meat for future victualling.\n\"And when the winter comes,\" said Tob, \"as its gales will be heavier\nthan this old ship can stomach, I had determined to haul up and make a\npermanent camp ashore, and get a crop of grain grown and threshed before\nsetting sail again. It is the usual custom in these voyages. And I shall\ndo it still, subject to my lord's better opinion.\"\n\nSo here, having by this time completed a two months' leisurely journey\nfrom the city, I saw my opportunity to speak what I had always carried\nin my mind. \"Tob,\" I said, \"I am a poor, weak, defenceless man, and I am\nquite at your mercy, but what if I do not voyage all the way to the Tin\nIslands, and oust you of this kingship?\"\n\nHe brightened perceptibly. \"Aye,\" he grunted, \"you are very weak, my\nlord, and mighty defenceless. We know all about that. But what's\nelse? You must tell all your meaning plain. I'm a common mariner, and\nunderstand little of your fancy talk.\"\n\n\"Why, this. That it is not my wish to leave the continent of Atlantis.\nIf you will put me down on any part of this side that faces Europe, I\nwill commend you strongly to the Gods. I would I could give you\nmoney, or (better still) articles that would be useful to you in your\ncolonising; but as it is, you see me destitute.\"\n\n\"As to that, you owe me nothing, having done vastly more than your share\neach time we have put in shore for the hunting. But it will not do, this\nplan of yours. I will shamedly confess that the sound of that kingship\nin my Tin Islands sounds sweet to me. But no, my lord, it will not do.\nYou are no mariner yet, and understand little of geography, but I must\ntell you that the part of Atlantis there\"--he jerked his thumb towards\nthe line of trees, and the mountains which lay beyond the fringe\nof surf--\"is called the Dangerous Lands, and a man must needs be a\nsalamander and be learned in magic (so I am told) before he can live\nthere.\"\n\nI laughed. \"We of the Priests' Clan have some education, Tob, though\nit may not be on the same lines as your own. In fact, I may say I was\ntaught in the colleges concerning the boundaries and the contents of\nour continent with a nicety that would surprise you. And once ashore, my\nfate will still be under the control of the most High Gods.\"\n\nHe muttered something in his profane seaman's way about preferring to\nkeep his own fate under control of his own most strong right arm, but\nsaying that he would keep the matter in his thoughts, he excused himself\nhurriedly to go and see to somewhat concerning the working of the ship,\nand there left me.\n\nBut I think the sweets of kingly rule were a strong argument in favour\nof letting me have my way (which I should have had otherwise if it had\nnot been given peacefully), and on the third day after our talk he\nput the ship inshore again for re-victualling. We lurched into a\nriver-mouth, half swamped over a roaring bar, and ran up against the\nbank and made fast there to trees, but booming ourselves a safe distance\noff with oars and poles, so that no beast could leap on board out of the\nthicket.\n\nFish-spearing and meat-hunting were set about with promptitude, and\non the second day we were happy enough to slay a yearling river-horse,\nwhich gave provisions in all sufficiency. A space was cleared on the\nbank, fires were lit, and the meat hung over the smoke in strips, and\nwhen as much was cured as the ship would carry, the shipmen made a final\ngorge on what remained, filled up a great stack of hollow reeds with\ndrinking water, and were ready to continue the voyage.\n\nWith sturdy generosity did Tob again attempt to make me sail on with\nthem as their future king, and as steadfastly did I make refusal; and\nat last stood alone on the bank amongst the gnawed bones of their feast,\nwith my weapons to bear me company, and he, and his men, and the women\nstood in the little old ship, ready to drop down river with the current.\n\n\"At least,\" said Tob, \"we'll carry your memory with us, and make it big\nin the Tin Islands for everlasting.\"\n\n\"Forget me,\" I said, \"I am nothing. I am merely an incident that has\ncome in your way. But if you want to carry some memory with you that\nshall endure, preserve the cult of the most High Gods as it was taught\nto you when you were children here in Atlantis. And afterwards, when\nyour colony grows in power, and has come to sufficient magnificence, you\nmay send to the old country for a priest.\"\n\n\"We want no priest, except one we shall make ourselves, and that will\nbe me. And as for the old Gods--well, I have laid my ideas before the\nfellows here, and they agree to this: We are done with those old Gods\nfor always. They seem worn out, if one may judge from Their present lack\nof usefulness in Atlantis, and, anyway, there will be no room for Them\non the Tin Islands.--Let go those warps there aft, and shove her head\nout.--We are under weigh now, my lord, and beyond recall, and so I am\nfree to tell you what we have decided upon for our religious exercises.\nWe shall set up the memory of a living Hero on earth, and worship that.\nAnd when in years to come the picture of his face grows dim, we shall\ndoubtless make an image of him, as accurate as our art permits, and\nbuild him a temple for shelter, and bring there our offerings and\nprayers. And as I say, my lord, I shall be priest, and when I am dead,\nthe sons of my body shall be priests after me, and the eldest a king\nalso.\"\n\n\"Let me plead with you,\" I said. \"This must not be.\"\n\nThe ship was drifting rapidly away with the current, and they were\nhoisting sail. Tob had to shout to make himself heard. \"Aye, but it\nshall be. For I, too, am a strong man after my kind, and I have ordered\nit so. And if you want the name of our Hero that some day shall be God,\nyou wear it on yourself. Deucalion shall be God for our children.\"\n\n\"This is blasphemy,\" I cried. \"Have a care, fool, or this impiety will\nsink you.\"\n\n\"We will risk it,\" he bawled back, \"and consider the odds against us are\nsmall. Regard! Here is thy last horn of wine in the ship, and my woman\nhas treasured it against this moment. Regard, all men, together\nwith Those above and Those below! I pour this wine as a libation to\nDeucalion, great lord that is to-day, Hero that shall be to-morrow, God\nthat will be in time to come!\" And then all those on the ship joined\nin the acclaim till they were beyond the reach of my voice, and were\nbattling their way out to sea through the roaring breakers of the bar.\n\nSolitary I stood at the brink of the forest, looking after them and\nmusing sadly. Tob, despite his lowly station, was a man I cared for more\nthan many. Like all seamen, I knew that he paid his devotions to one\nof the obscurer Gods, but till then I had supposed him devout in his\nworship. His new avowal came to me as a desolating shock. If a man like\nTob could forsake all the older Gods to set up on high some poor mortal\nwho had momentarily caught his fancy, what could be expected from\nthe mere thoughtless mob, when swayed by such a brilliant tongue as\nPhorenice's? It seemed I was to begin my exile with a new dreariness\nadded to all the other adverse prospects of Atlantis.\n\nBut then behind me I heard the rustle of some great beast that had\nscented me, and was coming to attack through the thicket, and so I had\nother matters to think upon. I had to let Tob and his ship go out over\nthe rim of the horizon unwatched.\n\n\n\n\n15. ZAEMON'S SUMMONS\n\n\nSince the days when man was first created upon the earth by Gods who\nlooked down and did their work from another place, there have always\nbeen areas of the land ill-adapted for his maintenance, but none more so\nthan that part of Atlantis which lies over against the savage continents\nof Europe and Africa. The common people avoid it, because of a\nsuperstition which says that the spirits of the evil dead stalk about\nthere in broad daylight, and slay all those that the more open dangers\nof the place might otherwise spare. And so it has happened often that\nthe criminals who might have fled there from justice, have returned\nof their own free will, and voluntarily given themselves up to the\ntormentors, rather than face its fabulous terrors.\n\nTo the educated, many of these legends are known to be mythical; but\nwithal there are enough disquietudes remaining to make life very arduous\nand stocked with peril. Everywhere the mountains keep their contents\non the boil; earth tremors are every day's experience; gushes of unseen\nevil vapours steal upon one with such cunningness and speed, that it is\noften hard to flee in time before one is choked and killed; poisons well\nup into the rivers, yet leave their colour unchanged; great cracks split\nacross the ground reaching down to the fires beneath, and the waters\ngush into these, and are shot forth again with devastating explosion;\nand always may be expected great outpourings of boiling mud or molten\nrock.\n\nYet with all this, there are great sombre forests in these lands, with\ntrees whose age is unimaginable, and fires amongst the herbage are rare.\nAll beneath the trees is water, and the air is full of warm steam and\nwetness. For a man to live in that constant hot damp is very mortifying\nto the strength. But strength is wanted, and cunning also beyond the\nordinary, for these dangerous lands are the abode of the lizards, which\nof all beasts grow to the most enormous size and are the most fearsome\nto deal with.\n\nThere are countless families and species of these lizards, and with some\nof them a man can contend with prospect of success. But there are others\nwhose hugeness no human force can battle against. One I saw, as it came\nup out of a lake after gaining its day's food, that made the wet land\nshake and pulse as it trod. It could have taken Phorenice's mammoth into\nits belly,* and even a mammoth in full charge could not have harmed it.\nGreat horny plates covered its head and body, and on the ridge of its\nback and tail and limbs were spines that tore great slivers from the\nblack trees as it passed amongst them.\n\n\n* TRANSLATOR'S NOTE: Professor Reeder of the Wyoming State University\nhas recently unearthed the skeleton of a Brontosaurus, 130 ft. in\nlength, which would have weighed 50 tons when alive. It was 35 ft. in\nheight at the hips, and 25 ft. at the shoulder, and 40 people could be\nseated with comfort within its ribs. Its thigh bone was 8 ft. long. The\nfossils of a whole series of these colossal lizards have been found.\n\n\nNow and again these monsters would get caught in some vast fissuring\nof the ground, but not often. Their speed of foot was great, and their\nsagacity keen. They seemed to know when the worst boilings of the\nmountains might be expected, and then they found safety in the deeper\nlakes, or buried themselves in wallows of the mud. Moreover, they were\nmore kindly constituted than man to withstand one great danger of these\nregions, in that the heat of the water did them no harm. Indeed, they\nwill lie peacefully in pools where sudden steam-bursts are making the\nwater leap into boiling fountains, and I have seen one run quickly\nacross a flow of molten rock which threatened to cut it off, and not be\nso much as singed in the transit.\n\nIn the midst of such neighbours, then, was my new life thrown, and\nexistence became perilous and hard to me from the outset. I came near to\nknowing what Fear was, and indeed only a fervent trust in the most High\nGods, and a firm belief that my life was always under Their fostering\ncare, prevented me from gaining that horrid knowledge. For long enough,\ntill I learned somewhat of the ways of this steaming, sweltering land,\nI was in as miserable a case as even Phorenice could have wished to see\nme. My clothes rotted from my back with the constant wetness, till I\nwent as naked as a savage from Europe; my limbs were racked with agues,\nand I could find no herbs to make drugs for their relief; for days\ntogether I could find no better food than tree-grubs and leaves; and\noften when I did kill beasts, knowing little of their qualities, I ate\nthose that gave me pain and sickness.\n\nBut as man is born to make himself adaptable to his surroundings, so\nas the months dragged on did I learn the limitation of this new life of\nmine, and gather some knowledge of its resources. As example: I found\na great black tree, with a hollow core, and a hole into its middle near\nthe roots. Here I harboured, till one night some monstrous lizard, whose\nsheer weight made the tree rock like a sapling, endeavoured to suck me\nforth as a bird picks a worm from a hollow log. I escaped by the will\nof the Gods--I could as much have done harm to a mountain as injure that\nhorny tongue with my weapons--but I gave myself warning that this chance\nmust not happen again.\n\nSo I cut myself a ladder of footholes on the inside of the trunk till I\nhad reached a point ten man-heights from the ground, and there cut other\nnotches, and with tree branches made a floor on which I might rest.\nLater, for luxury, I carved me arrow-slit windows in the walls of my\nchamber, and even carried up sand for a hearth, so that I might cook my\nvictual up there instead of lighting a fire in all the dangers of the\nopen below.\n\nBy degrees, too, I began to find how the large-scaled fish of the rivers\nand the lesser turtles might be more readily captured, and so my ribs\nthreatened less to start through their proper covering of skin as the\ndays went on. But the lack of salads and gruels I could never overcome.\nAll the green meat was tainted so powerfully with the taste of tars that\nnever could I force my palate to accept it. And of course, too, there\nremained the peril of the greater lizards and the other dangers native\nto the place.\n\nBut as the months began to mount into years, and the brute part of my\nnature became more satisfied, there came other longings which it was\nless easy to provide for. From the ivory of a river horse's tooth I had\nendeavoured to carve me a representative of Nais as last I had seen her.\nBut, though my fingers might be loving, and my will good, my art was\nof the dullest, and the result--though I tried time and time again--was\nalways clumsy and pitiful. Still, in my eyes it carried some suggestion\nof the original--a curve here, an outline there, and it made my old love\nglow anew within me as I sat and ate it with my eyes. Yet it did little\nto satisfy my longings for the woman I had lost; rather it whetted my\ncravings to be with her again, or at least to have some knowledge of her\nfate.\n\nOther men of the Priests' Clan have come out and made an abode in these\nDangerous Lands, and by mortifying the flesh, have gained an intimacy\nwith the Higher Mysteries which has carried them far past what mere\nhuman learning and repetition could teach. Indeed, here and there one,\nwho from some cause and another has returned to the abodes of men, has\ncarried with him a knowledge that has brought him the reputation amongst\nthe vulgar for the workings of magic and miracles, which--since all arts\nmust be allowed which aid so holy a cause--have added very materially to\nthe ardour with which these common people pursue the cult of the Gods.\nBut for myself I could not free my mind to the necessary clearness for\nfollowing these abstruse studies. During that voyage home from Yucatan I\nhad communed with them with growing insight; but now my mind was not my\nown. Nais had a lien upon it, and refused to be ousted; and, in truth,\nher sweet trespass was my chief solace.\n\nBut at last my longing could no further be denied. Through one of\nthe arrow-slit windows of my tree-house I could see far away a great\nmountain top whitened with perpetual snow, which our Lord the Sun dyed\nwith blood every night of His setting. Night after night I used to watch\nthat ruddy light with wide straining eyes. Night after night I used to\nremember that in days agone when I was entering upon the priesthood, it\nhad been my duty to adore our great Lord as He rose for His day behind\nthe snows of that very mountain. And always the thought followed on\nthese musings, that from that distant crest I could see across the\ncontinent to the Sacred Mount, which had the city below it where I had\nburied my love alive.\n\nSo at last I gave way and set out, and a perilous journey I made of it.\nIn the heavy mists, which hung always on the lower ground, my way lay\nblind before me, and I was constantly losing it. Indeed, to say that\nI traversed three times the direct distance is setting a low estimate.\nThroughout all those swamps the great lizards hunted, and as the country\nwas new to me I did not know places of harbour, and a hundred times was\nwithin an ace of being spied and devoured at a mouthful. But the High\nGods still desired me for Their own purposes, and blinded the great\nbeasts' eyes when I slunk to cover as they passed. Twice rivers of\nscalding water roared boiling across my path, and I had to delay till I\ncould collect enough black timber from the forests to build rafts that\nwould give me dry ferriage.\n\nIt will be seen then that my journey was in a way infinitely tedious,\nbut to me, after all those years of waiting, the time passed on winged\nfeet. I had been separated from my love till I could bear the strain\nno longer; let me but see from a distance the place where she lay, and\nfeast my eyes upon it for a while, and then I could go back to my abode\nin the tree and there remain patiently awaiting the will of the Gods.\n\nThe air grew more chilly as I began to come out above the region of\ntrees, on to that higher ground which glares down on the rest of the\nworld, and I made buskins and a coat of woven grasses to protect my body\nfrom the cold, which began to blow upon me keenly. And later on, where\nthe snow lay eternally, and was blown into gullies, and frozen into\nsolid banks and bergs of ice, I had hard work to make any progress\namongst its perilous mazes, and was moreover so numbed by the chill,\nthat my natural strength was vastly weakened. Overhead, too, following\nme up with forbidding swoops, and occasionally coming so close that I\nhad to threaten it with my weapons, was one of those huge man-eating\nbirds which live by pulling down and carrying off any creature that\ntheir instincts tell them is weakly, and likely soon to die.\n\nBut the lure ahead of me was strong enough to make these difficulties\nseem small, and though the air of the mountain agreed with me ill,\ncausing sickness and panting, I pressed on with what speed I could\nmuster towards the elusive summit. Time after time I thought the next\nspurt would surely bring me out to the view for which my soul yearned,\nbut always there seemed another bank of snow and ice yet to be climbed.\nBut at last I reached the crest, and gave thanks to the most High Gods\nfor Their protection and favour.\n\nFar, far away I could see the Sacred Mountain with its ring of fires\nburning pale under the day, and although the splendid city which nestled\nat its foot could not be seen from where I stood, I knew its position\nand I knew its plan, and my soul went out to that throne of granite in\nthe square before the royal pyramid, where once, years before, I had\nburied my love. Had Phorenice left the tomb unviolated?\n\nI stood there leaning on my spear, filling my eye with the prospect,\nwarming even to the smoke of mountains that I recognised as old\nacquaintances. Gods! how my love burned within me for this woman. My\nwhole being seemed gone out to meet her, and to leave room for nothing\nbeside. For long enough a voice seemed dimly to be calling me, but\nI gave it no regard. I had come out to that hoary mountain top for\ncommunion with Nais alone, and I wanted none others to interrupt.\n\nBut at length the voice calling my name grew too loud to be neglected,\nand I pulled myself out of my sweet musing with a start to think that\nhere, for the first time since parting with Tob and his company, I\nshould see another human fellow-being. I gripped my weapon and asked who\ncalled. The reply came clearly from up the slopes of mountain, and I saw\na man coming towards me over the snows. He was old and feeble. His body\nwas bent, and his hair and beard were white as the ground on which he\ntrod, and presently I recognised him as Zaemon. He was coming towards\nme with incredible speed for a man of his years and feebleness, but he\ncarried in his hand the glowing Symbol of our Lord the Sun, and holy\nstrength from this would add largely to his powers.\n\nHe came close to me and made the sign of the Seven, which I returned\nto him, with its completion, with due form and ceremony. And then he\nsaluted me in the manner prescribed as messenger appointed by the High\nCouncil of the Priests seated before the Ark of the Mysteries, and I\nmade humble obeisance before him.\n\n\"In all things I will obey the orders that you put before me,\" I said.\n\n\"Such is your duty, my brother. The command is, that you return\nimmediately to the Sacred Mountain, so that if human means may still\nprevail, you, as the most skilful general Atlantis owns within her\nborders, may still save the country from final wreck and punishment. The\nwoman Phorenice persists in her infamies. The poor land groans under\nher heel. And now she has laid siege to our Sacred Mountain itself, and\nswears that not one soul shall be left alive in all Atlantis who does\nnot bend humbly to her will.\"\n\n\"It is a command and I obey it. But let me ask of another matter that is\nintimate to both of us. What of Nais?\"\n\n\"Nais rests where you left her, untouched. Phorenice knows by her\narts--she has stolen nearly all the ancient knowledge now--that still\nyou live, and she keeps Nais unharmed beneath the granite throne in the\nhopes that some time she may use her as a weapon against you. Little she\nknows the sternness of our Priests' creed, my brother. Why, even I, that\nam the girl's father, would sacrifice her blithely, if her death or ruin\nmight do a tittle of good to Atlantis.\"\n\n\"You go beyond me with your devotion.\"\n\nThe old man leaned forward at me, with glowering brow. \"What!\"\n\n\"Or my old blind adherence to the ancient dogma has been sapped and\nweakened by events. You must buy my full obedience, Zaemon, if you want\nit. Promise me Nais--and your arts I know can snatch her--and I will be\ntrue servant to the High Council of the Priest, and will die in the\nlast ditch if need be for the carrying out of order. But let me see Nais\ngiven over to the fury of that wanton woman, and I shall have no inwards\nleft, except to take my vengeance, and to see Atlantis piled up in ruins\nas her funeral-stone.\"\n\nZaemon looked at me bitterly. \"And you are the man the High Council\nthought to trust as they would trust one of themselves? Truly we are in\nan age of weak men and faithless now. But, my lord--nay, I must call you\nbrother still: we cannot be too nice in our choosing to-day--you are the\nbest there is, and we must have you. We little thought you would ask a\nprice for your generalship, having once taken oath on the walls of the\nArk of the Mysteries itself that always, come what might, you would be a\nservant of the High Council of the Clan without fee and without hope of\nadvancement. But this is the age of broken vows, and you are going no\nmore than trim with the fashion. Indeed, brother, perhaps I should thank\nyou for being no more greedy in your demands.\"\n\n\"You may spare me your taunts. You, by self-denial and profound search\ninto the highest of the higher Mysteries, have made yourself something\nwiser than human; I have preserved my humanity, and with it its powers\nand frailties; and it seems that each of us has his proper uses, or\nyou would not be come now here to me. Rather you would have done the\ngeneralling yourself.\"\n\n\"You make a warm defence, my brother. But I have no leisure now to stand\nbefore you with argument. Come to the Sacred Mountain, fight me this\nwanton, upstart Empress, and by my beard you shall have your Nais as you\nleft her as a reward.\"\n\n\"It is a command of the High Council which shall be obeyed. I will come\nwith my brother now, as soon as he is rested.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the old man, \"I have no tiredness, and as for coming with\nme, there you will not be able. But follow at what pace you may.\"\n\nHe turned and set off down the snowy slopes of the mountain and I\nfollowed; but gradually he distanced me; and so he kept on, with speed\nalways increasing, till presently he passed out of my sight round the\nspur of an ice-cliff, and I found myself alone on the mountain side.\nYes, truly alone. For his footmarks in the snow from being deep, grew\nshallower, and less noticeable, so that I had to stoop to see them. And\npresently they vanished entirely, and the great mountain's flank lay\nbefore me trackless, and untrodden by the foot of man since time began.\n\nI was not shaken by any great amazement. Though it was beyond my poor\nart to compass this thing myself, having occupied my mind in exile more\nwith memories of Nais than in study of those uppermost recesses of the\nHigher Mysteries in which Zaemon was so prodigiously wise, still I had\nsome inkling of his powers.\n\nZaemon I knew would be back again in his dwelling on the Sacred\nMountain, shaken and breathless, even before I had found an end to his\ntracks in the snow, and it behoved me to join him there in the quickest\npossible time. I had his promise now for my reward, and I knew that he\nwould carry it into effect. Beforetime I had made an error. I had valued\nAtlantis most, and Nais, my private love, as only second. But now it was\nin my mind to be honest with others even as with myself. Though all\nthe world were hanging on my choice, I could but love my Nais most, and\nserve her first and foremost of all.\n\n\n\n\n16. SIEGE OF THE SACRED MOUNTAIN\n\n\nNow, my passage across the great continent of Atlantis, if tedious and\nhaunted by many dangers, need not be recounted in detail here. Only one\nhalt did I make of any duration, and that was unavoidable. I had killed\na stag one day, bringing it down after a long chase in an open savannah.\nI scented the air carefully, to see if there was any other beast which\ncould do me harm within reach, and thinking that the place was safe,\nset about cutting my meat, and making a sufficiency into a bundle for\ncarriage.\n\nBut underfoot amongst the grasses there was a great legged worm, a\nmonstrous green thing, very venomous in its bite; and presently as I\nmoved I brushed it with my heel, and like the dart of light it swooped\nwith its tiny head and struck me with its fangs in the lower thigh. With\nmy knife I cut through its neck and it fell to writhing and struggling\nand twining its hundred legs into all manner of contortions; and then,\ncleaning my blade in the ground, I stabbed with it deep all round the\nwound, so that the blood might flow freely and wash the venom from its\nlodgement. And then with the blood trickling healthily down from my\nheel, I shouldered the meat and strode off, thankful for being so well\nquit of what might have made itself a very ugly adventure.\n\nAs I walked, however, my leg began to be filled with a tightness and\nthrobbing which increased every hour, and presently it began to swell\nalso, till the skin was stretched like drawn parchment. I was taken,\ntoo, with a sickness, that racked me violently, and if one of the\ngreater and more dangerous beasts had come upon me then, he would have\neaten me without a fight. With the fall of darkness I managed to haul\nmyself up into a tree, and there abode in the crutch of a limb, in\nwakefulness and pain throughout the night.\n\nWith the dawn, when the night beasts had gone to their lairs, I\nclambered down again, and leaning heavily on my spear, limped onwards\nthrough the sombre forests along my way. The moss which grows on the\nnorthern side of each tree was my guide, but gradually I began to note\nthat I was seeing moss all round the trees, and, in fact, was growing\nlight-headed with the pain and the swelling of the limb. But still I\npressed onwards with my journey, my last instinct being to obey the\ncommand of the High Council, and so procure the enlargement of Nais as\nhad been promised.\n\nMy last memory was of being met by someone in the black forest who aided\nme, and there my waking senses took wings into forgetfulness.\n\nBut after an interval, wit returned, and I found myself on a bed of\nleaves in a cleft between two rocks, which was furnished with some poor\nskill, and fortified with stakes and buildings against the entrance of\nthe larger marauding beasts. My wound was dressed with a poultice of\nherbs, and at the other side of the cavern there squatted a woman,\ncooking a mess of wood-grubs and honey over a fire of sticks.\n\n\"How came I here?\" I asked.\n\n\"I brought you,\" said she.\n\n\"And who are you?\"\n\n\"A nymph, they call me, and I practise as such, collecting herbs and\ncuring the diseases of those that come to me, telling fortunes, and\nmaking predictions. In return I receive what each can afford, and if\nthey do not pay according to their means, I clap on a curse to make them\nwither. It's a lean enough living when wars and the pestilence have left\nso few poor folk to live in the land.\"\n\n\"Do you visit Atlantis?\"\n\n\"Not I. Phorenice would have me boiled in brine, living, if she could\nlay easy hands on me. Our dainty Empress tolerates no magic but her own.\nThey say she is for pulling down the Priests off their Mountain now.\"\n\n\"So you do get news of the city?\"\n\n\"Assuredly. It is my trade to get good news, or otherwise how could I\ntell fortunes to the vulgar? You see, my lord, I detected your quality\nby your speech, and knowing you are not one of those that come to me for\nspells, and potions, I have no fear in speaking to you plainly.\"\n\n\"Tell me then: Phorenice still reigns?\"\n\n\"Most vilely.\"\n\n\"As a maiden?\"\n\n\"As the mother of twin sons. Tatho's her husband now, and has been these\nthree years.\"\n\n\"Tatho! Who followed him as viceroy of Yucatan?\"\n\n\"There is no Yucatan. A vast nation of little hairy men, so the tale\ngoes, coming from the West overran the country. They had clubs of\nwood tipped with stone as their only arm, but numbers made their chief\nweapon. They had no desire for plunder, or the taking of slaves, or\nthe conquering of cities. To eat the flesh of Atlanteans was their only\nlust, and they followed it prodigiously. Their numbers were like the\nbees in a swarm.\n\n\"They came to each of the cities of Yucatan in turn, and though\nthe colonists slew them in thousands, the weight of numbers always\nprevailed. They ate clean each city they took, and left it to the beasts\nof the forest, and went on to the next. And so in time they reached the\ncoast towns, and Tatho and the few that survived took ship, and\nsailed home. They even ate Tatho's wife for him. They must be curious\npersevering things, these little hairy men. The Gods send they do not\nget across the seas to Atlantis, or they would be worse plague to the\npoor country than Phorenice.\"\n\nNow I had heard of these little hairy creatures before, and though\nindeed I had never seen them, I had gathered that they were a little\nless than human and a little more than bestial; a link so to speak\nbetween the two orders; and specially held in check by the Gods in\ncertain forest solitudes. Also I had learned that on occasion, when\npunishment was needful, they could be set loose as a devastating army\nupon men, devouring all before them. But I said nothing of this to the\nnymph, she being but a vulgar woman, and indeed half silly, as is always\nthe case with these self-styled sorceresses who gull the ignorant,\ncommon folk. But within myself I was bitterly grieved at the fate of\nthat fine colony of Yucatan, in which I had expended such an infinity of\npains to do my share of the building.\n\nBut it did not suit my purpose to have my name and quality blazoned\nabroad till the time was full, and so I said nothing to the nymph about\nYucatan, but let the talk continue upon other matters. \"What about\nEgypt?\" I asked.\n\n\"In its accustomed darkness, so they say. Who cares for Egypt these\nlatter years? Who cares for anyone or anything for that matter except\nfor himself and his own proper estate? Time was when the country folk\nand the hunters hereabouts brought me offerings to this cave for sheer\npiety's sake. But now they never come near unless they see a way of\ngetting good value in return for their gifts. And, by result, instead\nof living fat and hearty, I make lean meals off honey and grubs. It's\na poor life, a nymph's, in these latter years I tell you, my lord. It's\nthe fashion for all classes to believe in no kind of mystery now.\"\n\n\"What manner of pestilence is this you spoke of?\"\n\n\"I have not seen it. Thank the Gods it has not come this way. But they\ndo say that it has grown from the folk Phorenice has slain, and whose\nbodies remain unburied. She is always slaying, and so the bodies lie\nthicker than the birds and beasts can eat them. For which of our sins,\nI wonder, did the Gods let Phorenice come to reign? I wish that she and\nher twins were boiled alive in brine before they came between an honest\nnymph of the forest and her living.\n\n\"They say she has put an image of herself in all the temples of the\ncity now, and has ordered prayers and sacrifices to be made night\nand morning. She has decreed all other Gods inferior to herself\nand forbidden their worship, and those of the people that are not\nsufficiently devout for her taste, have their hamstrings slit by their\ntormentors to aid them constantly into a devotional attitude.--Will you\neat of my grubs and honey? There is nothing else. Your back was bloody\nwith carrying meat when I met you, but you had lost your load. You must\neither taste this mess of mine now, or go without.\"\n\nI harboured with that nymph in cave six days, she using her drugs and\ncharms to cure my leg the while, and when I was recovered, I hunted the\nplains and killed her a fat cloven-hoofed horse as payment, and then\nwent along my ways.\n\nThe country from there onwards had at one time carried a sturdy\npopulation which held its own firmly, and, as its numbers grew, took in\nmore ground, and built more homesteads farther afield. The houses were\nperched in trees for the most part, as there they were out of reach\nof cave-bear and cave-tiger and the other more dangerous beasts. But\nothers, and these were the better ones, were built on the ground, of\nlogs so ponderous and so firmly clamped and dovetailed that the beasts\ncould not pull them down, and once inside a house of this fashion\nits owners were safe, and could progue at any attackers through the\ninterstices between the logs, and often wound, sometimes make a kill.\n\nBut not one in ten of these outlying settlers remained. The houses were\nsilent when I reached them, the fire-hearth before the door weed-grown,\nand the patch of vegetables taken back by the greedy fingers of the\nforest into mere scrub and jungle. And farther on, when villages began\nto appear, strongly-walled as the custom is, to ward off the attacks of\nbeasts, the logs which aforetime had barred the gateway lay strewn in\na sprouting undergrowth, and naught but the kitchen middens remained to\nprove that once they had sheltered human tenants. Phorenice's influence\nseemed to have spread as though it were some horrid blight over the\nwhole face of what was once a smiling and an easy-living land.\n\nSo far I had met with little enough interference from any men I had come\nacross. Many had fled with their women into the depths of the forest at\nthe bare sight of me; some stood their ground with a threatening face,\nbut made no offer to attack, seeing that I did not offer them insult\nfirst; and a few, a very few, offered me shelter and provision. But as\nI neared the city, and began to come upon muddy beaten paths, I passed\nthrough governments that were more thickly populated, and here appeared\nstrong chance of delay. The watcher in the tower which is set above each\nvillage would spy me and cry: \"Here is a masterless man,\" and then the\npeople that were within would rush out with intent to spoil me of my\nweapons, and afterwards to appoint me as a labourer.\n\nI had no desire to slay these wretched folk, being filled with pity at\nthe state to which they had fallen; and often words served me to make\nthem stand aside from the path, and stare wonderingly at my fierceness,\nand let me go my ways. And when at other times words had no avail, I\nstrove to strike as lightly as could be, my object being to get forward\nwith my journey and leave no unnecessary dead behind me. Indeed, having\nfound the modern way of these villages, it grew to be my custom to turn\noff into the forest, and make a circuit whenever I came within smell of\ntheir garbage.\n\nSimilarly, too, when I got farther on, and came amongst greater towns\nalso, I kept beyond challenge of their walls, having no mind to risk\ndelay from the whim of any new law which might chance to be set up by\ntheir governors. My progress might be slinking, but my pride did not\nupbraid me very loudly; indeed, the fever of haste burned within me so\nhot and I had little enough carrying space for other emotions.\n\nBut at last I found myself within a half-day's journey the city of\nAtlantis itself, with the Sacred Mountain and its ring of fires looming\nhigh beside it, and the call for caution became trebly accentuated.\nEverywhere evidences showed that the country had been drained of its\nfighting men. Everywhere women prayed that the battles might end\nwith the rout of the Priests or the killing of Phorenice, so that the\nwretched land might have peace and time to lick its wounds.\n\nAn army was investing the Sacred Mountain, and its one approach was most\nnarrowly guarded. Even after having journeyed so far, it seemed as if I\nshould have to sit hopelessly down without being able to carry out the\norders which had been laid upon me by the High Council, and earn the\nreward which had been promised. Force would be useless here. I should\nhave one good fight--a gorgeous fight--one man against an army, and my\nusefulness would be ended.... No; this was the occasion for guile, and\nI found covert in the outskirts of a wood, and lay there cudgelling my\nbrain for a plan.\n\nAcross the plain before me lay the grim great walls of the city, with\nthe heads of its temples, and its palaces, and its pyramids showing\nbeyond. The step-sides of the royal pyramid held my eye. Phorenice had\nexpended some of her new-found store of gold in overlaying their former\nwhiteness with sheets of shining yellow metal. But it was not that\nchange that moved me. I was remembering that, in the square before the\npyramid, there stood a throne of granite carved with the snake and the\noutstretched hand, and in the hollow beneath the throne was Nais, my\nlove, asleep these eight years now because of the drug that had been\ngiven to her, but alive still, and waiting for me, if only I on my\npart could make a way to the place where Zaemon defied the Empress, and\nannounce my coming.\n\nIn that covert of the woods I lay a day and a night raging with myself\nfor not discovering some plan to get within the defences of the Sacred\nMountain, but in the morning which followed, there came a man towards me\nrunning.\n\n\"You need not threaten me with your weapons,\" he cried. \"I mean no harm.\nIt seems that you are Deucalion; though I should not have known you\nmyself in those rags and skins, and behind that tangle of hair and\nbeard. You will give me your good word I know. Believe me, I have not\nloitered unduly.\"\n\nHe was a lower priest whom I knew, and held in little esteem; his name\nwas Ro, a greedy fellow and not overworthy of trust. \"From whom do you\ncome?\" I asked.\n\n\"Zaemon laid a command on me. He came to my house, though how he got\nthere I cannot tell, seeing that Phorenice's army blocks all possible\npassage to and from the Mountain. I told him I wished to be mixed with\nnone of his schemings. I am a peaceful man, Deucalion, and have taken a\nwife who requires nourishment. I still serve in the same temple, though\nwe have swept out the old Gods by order of the Empress, and put her\nimage in their place. The people are tidily pious nowadays, those that\nare left of them, and the living is consequently easy. Yes, I tell you\nthere are far more offerings now than there were in the old days. And\nso I had no wish to be mixed with matters which might well make me be\ndeprived of a snug post, and my head to boot.\"\n\n\"I can believe it all of you, Ro.\"\n\n\"But there was no denying Zaemon. He burst into one of his black furies,\nand while he spoke at me, I tell you I felt as good as dead. You know\nhis powers?\"\n\n\"I have seen some of them.\"\n\n\"Well, the Gods alone know which are the true Gods, and which are the\nothers. I serve the one that gives me employment. But those that Zaemon\nserves give him power, and that's beyond denying. You see that right\nhand of mine? It is dead and paralysed from the wrist, and that is\na gift of Zaemon. He bestowed it, he said, to make me collect my\nattention. Then he said more hard things concerning what he was pleased\nto term my apostasy, not letting me put up a word in my own defence of\nhow the change was forced upon me. And finally, said he, I might\neither do his bidding on a certain matter to the letter, or take that\npunishment which my falling away from the old Gods had earned. 'I\nshall not kill you,' said he, 'but I will cover all your limbs with a\nparalysis, such as you have tasted already, and when at length death\nreaches you in some gutter, you will welcome it.'\"\n\n\"If Zaemon said those words, he meant them. So you accepted the\nalternative?\"\n\n\"Had I, with a wife depending on me, any other choice? I asked his\npleasure. It was to find you when you came in here from some distant\npart of the land, and deliver to you his message.\n\n\"'Then tell me where is the meeting place,' said I, 'and when.'\n\n\"'There is none appointed, nor is the day fixed,' said he. 'You must\nwatch and search always for him. But when he comes, you will be guided\nto his place.' Well, Deucalion, I think I was guided, but how, I do\nnot know. But now I have found you, and if there's such a thing as\ngratitude, I ask you to put in your word with Zaemon that this deadness\nbe taken away from my hand. It's an awful thing for a man to be forced\nto go through life like this, for no real fault of his own. And Zaemon\ncould cure it from where he sat, if he was so minded.\"\n\n\"You seem still to have a very full faith in some of the old Gods'\npriests,\" I said. \"But so far, I do not see that your errand is done. I\nhave had no message yet.\"\n\n\"Why, the message is so simple that I do not see why he could not have\ngot some one else to carry it. You are to make a great blaze. You may\nfire the grasses of the plain in front of this wood if you choose. And\non the night which follows, you are to go round to that flank of the\nSacred Mountain away from the city where the rocks run down sheer, and\nthere they will lower a rope and haul you up to their hands above.\"\n\n\"It seems easy, and I thank you for your pains. I will ask Zaemon that\nyour hand may be restored to you.\"\n\n\"You shall have my prayers if it is. And look, Deucalion, it is a small\nmatter, and it would be less likely to slip your memory if you saw to it\nat once on your landing. Later, you may be disturbed. Phorenice is bound\nto pull you down off your perch up there now she has made her mind to\nit. She never fails, once she has set her hand to a thing. Indeed,\nif she was no Goddess at birth, she is making herself into one very\nrapidly. She has got all the ancient learning of our Priests, and more\nbesides. She has discovered the Secret of Life these recent months--\"\n\n\"She has found that?\" I cried, fairly startled. \"How? Tell me how? Only\nthe Three know that. It is beyond our knowledge even who are members of\nthe Seven.\"\n\n\"I know nothing of her means. But she has the secret, and now she is as\ngood an immortal (so she says) as any of them. Well, Deucalion, it is\ndangerous for me to be missing from my temple overlong, so I will go.\nYou will carry that matter we spoke of in your mind? It means much\nto me.\"--His eye wandered over my ragged person--\"And if you think my\nservice is of value to you--\"\n\n\"You see me poor, my man, and practically destitute.\"\n\n\"Some small coin,\" he murmured, \"or even a link of bronze? I am at\ngreat expense just now buying nourishment for my wife. Well, if you have\nnothing, you cannot give. So I'll just bid you farewell.\"\n\nHe took himself off then, and I was not sorry. I had never liked Ro. But\nI wasted no more precious time then. The grass blazed up for a signal\nalmost before his timorous heels were clear of it, and that night when\nthe darkness gave me cover, I took the risk of what beasts might be\nprowling, and went to the place appointed. There was no rope dangling,\nbut presently one came down the smooth cliff face like some slender\nsnake. I made a loop, slipped it over a leg, and pulled hard as a\nsignal. Those above began to haul, and so I went back to the Sacred\nMountain after an absence of so many toilsome and warring years. There\nwere none to disturb the ascent. Phorenice's troops had no thought to\nguard that gaunt, bare, seamless precipice.\n\nThe men who hauled me up were old, and panted heavily with their task,\nand, until I knew the reason, I wondered why a knot of younger priests\nhad not been appointed for the duty. But I put no question. With us of\nthe Priests' Clan on the Sacred Mountain, it is always taken as granted\nthat when an order is given, it is given for the best. Besides, these\npriests did not offer themselves to question. They took me off at once\nto Zaemon, and that is what I could have wished.\n\nThe old man greeted me with the royal sign. \"All hail to Deucalion,\" he\ncried, \"King of Atlantis, duly called thereto by the High Council of the\npriests.\"\n\n\"Is Phorenice dead?\" I asked.\n\n\"It remains for you to slay her, and take your kingdom, if, indeed,\nwhen all is done, there remains a man or a rood of land to govern. The\nsentence has gone out that she is to die, and it shall be carried into\neffect, even though we have to set loose the most dreadful powers that\nare stored in the Ark of the Mysteries, and wreck this continent in our\neffort. We have borne with her infamies all these years by command sent\ndown by the most High Gods; but now she has gone beyond endurance, and\nThey it is who have given the word for her cutting off.\"\n\n\"You are one of the highest Three; I am only one of the Seven; you best\nknow the cost.\"\n\n\"There can be no counting the cost now, my brother, and my king. It is\nan order.\"\n\n\"It is an order,\" I repeated formally, \"so I obey.\"\n\n\"If it were not impious to do so, it would be easy to justify this\ndecision of the Gods. The woman has usurped the throne; yet she was\nforgiven and bidden rule on wisely. She has tampered with our holy\nreligion; yet she was forgiven. She has killed the peoples of Atlantis\nin greedy useless wars, and destroyed the country's trade; yet she was\nforgiven. She has desecrated the old temples, and latterly has set up\nin them images of herself to be worshipped as a deity; yet she was\nforgiven. But at last her evil cleverness has discovered to her the\ntremendous Secret of Life and Death, and there she overstepped the\nboundary of the High Gods' forbearance.\n\n\"I myself went to carry a final warning, and once more faced her in\nthe great banqueting-hall. Solemnly I recited to her the edict, and she\nchose to take it as a challenge. She would live on eternally herself and\nshe would share her knowledge with those that pleased her. Tatho that\nwas her husband should also be immortal. Indeed, if she thought fit, she\nwould cry the secret aloud so that even the common people might know it,\nand death from mere age would become a legend.\n\n\"She cared no wit how she might upset the laws of Nature. She was\nPhorenice, and was the highest law of all. And finally she defied me\nthere in that banqueting-hall and defied also the High Gods that stood\nbehind my mouth. 'My magic is as strong as yours, you pompous fool,'\nshe cried, 'and presently you shall see the two stand side by side upon\ntheir trial.'\n\n\"She began to collect an army from that moment, and we on our part made\nour preparations. It was discovered by our arts that you still lived,\nand King of Atlantis you were made by solemn election. How you were\nsummoned, you know as nearly as it is lawful that one of your degree\nshould know; how you came, you understand best yourself; but here you\nare, my brother, and being King now, you must order all things as you\nsee best for the preservation of your high estate, and we others live\nonly to give you obedience.\"\n\n\"Then being King, I can speak without seeming to make use of a threat.\nI must have my Queen first, or I am not strong enough to give my whole\nmind to this ruling.\"\n\n\"She shall be brought here.\"\n\n\"So! Then I will be a General now, and see to the defences of this\nplace, and view the men who are here to stand behind them.\"\n\nI went out of the dwelling then, Zaemon giving place and following me.\nIt was night still but there is no darkness on the upper part of the\nSacred Mountain. A ring of fires, fed eternally from the earth-breath\nwhich wells up from below, burns round one-half of the crest, lighting\nit always as bright as day, and in fact forming no small part of its\nfortification. Indeed, it is said that, in the early dawn of history,\nmen first came to the Mountain as a stronghold because of the natural\ndefence which the fires offered.\n\nThere is no bridging these flames or smothering them. On either side\nof their line for a hundred paces the ground glows with heat, and a man\nwould be turned to ash who tried to cross it. Round full one-half the\nmountain slopes the fires make a rampart unbreakable, and on the other\nside the rock runs in one sheer precipice from the crest to the plain\nwhich spreads beyond its foot. But it is on this farther side that there\nis the only entrance way which gives passage to the crest of the Sacred\nMountain from below. Running diagonally up the steep face of the cliff\nis a gigantic fissure, which succeeding ages (as man has grown more\nluxurious) have made more easy to climb.\n\nLooking at the additions, in the ancient days, I can well imagine that\nnone but the most daring could have made the ascent. But one generation\nhas thrown a bridge over a bad gap here, and another has cut into the\nliving stone and widened a ledge there, till in these latter years there\nis a path with cut steps and carved balustrade such as the feeblest or\nmost giddy might traverse with little effort or exertion. But always\nwhen these improvers made smooth the obstacles, they were careful to\nweaken in no possible way the natural defences but rather to add to\nthem.\n\nEight gates of stone there were cutting the pathway, each commanding\na straight, steep piece of the ascent, and overhanging each gate was a\ngallery secure from arrow-shot, yet so contrived that great stones could\nbe hurled through holes in the floor of it, in such a manner that they\nmust irretrievably smash to a pulp any men advancing against it from\nbelow. And in caves dug out from the rock on either hand was a great\nhoard of these stones, so that no enemy through sheer expenditure of\ntroops could hope to storm a gate by exhausting its ammunition.\n\nBut though there were eight of these granite gates in the series, we had\nthe whole number to depend on no longer. The lowest gate was held by\na garrison of Phorenice's troops, who had built a wall above them to\nprotect their occupation. The gate had been gained by no brilliant feat\nof arms--it had been won by threats, bribery, and promises; or, in other\nwords, it had been given up by the blackest treachery.\n\nAnd here lay the keynote of the weakness in our defence. The most\nperfect ramparts that brain can invent are useless without men to line\nthem, and it was men we lacked. Of students entering into the colleges\nof the Sacred Mountain, there had been none now for many a year. The\nyounger generation thought little of the older Gods. Of the men that had\ngrown up amongst the sacred groves, and filled offices there, many had\nbecome lukewarm in their faith and remained on only through habit, and\nbecause an easy living stayed near them there; and these, when the siege\nbegan, quickly made their way over to the other side.\n\nPhorenice was no fool to fight against unnecessary strength. Her heralds\nmade proclamation that peace and a good subsistence would be given to\nthose who chose to come out to her willingly; and as an alternative she\nwould kill by torture and mutilation those she caught in the place when\nshe took it by storm, as she most assuredly would do before she had\nfinished with it. And so great was the prestige of her name, that quite\none-half of these that remained on the mountain took themselves away\nfrom the defence.\n\nThere was no attempt to hold back these sorry priests, nor was there any\npunishing them as they went. Zaemon, indeed, was minded (so he told me\nwith grim meaning himself) to give them some memento of their apostasy\nto carry away which would not wear out, but the others of the High\nCouncil made him stay his vengeful hand. And so when I came to the place\nthe garrison numbered no more than eighty, counting even feeble old\ndotards who could barely walk; and of men not past their prime I could\nbarely command a score.\n\nStill, seeing the narrowness of the passages which led to each of the\ngates, up which in no place could more than two men advance together, we\nwere by no means in desperate straits for the defence as yet; and if my\nnew-given kingdom was so far small, consisting as it did in effect of\nthe Sacred Mountain and no other part of Atlantis, at any rate there\nseemed little danger of its being further contracted.\n\nAnother of the wise precautions of the men of old stood us in good stead\nthen. In the ancient times, when grain first was grown as food, it came\nto be looked upon as the acme of wealth. Tribute was always paid from\nthe people to their Priests, and presently, so the old histories say,\nit was appointed that this should take the form of grain, as this was\na medium both dignified and fitting. And those of the people who had\nit not, were forced to barter their other produce for grain before they\ncould pay this tribute.\n\nOn the Sacred Mountain itself vast storehouses were dug in the rock, and\nhere the grain was teemed in great yellow heaps, and each generation of\nthose that were set over it, took a pride in adding to the accumulation.\n\nIn more modern days it had been a custom amongst the younger and more\nforward of the Priests to scoff at this ancient provision, and to hold\nthat a treasure of gold, or weapons, or jewels would have more value and\nno less of dignity; and more than once it has been a close thing\nlest these innovators should not be out-voted. But as it was, the old\nconstitution had happily been preserved, and now in these years of trial\nthe Clan reaped the benefit. And so with these granaries, and a series\nof great tanks and cisterns which held the rainfall, there was no chance\nof Phorenice reducing our stronghold by mere close investment, even\nthough she sat down stubbornly before it for a score of years.\n\nBut it was the paucity of men for the defence which oppressed me most.\nAs I took my way about the head of the Mountain, inspecting all points,\nthe emptiness of the place smote me like a succession of blows. The\ngroves, once so trim, were now shaggy and unpruned. Wind had whirled\nthe leaves in upon the temple floors, and they lay there unswept. The\ncollege of youths held no more now than a musty smell to bear witness\nthat men had once been grown there. The homely palaces of the higher\nPriests, at one time so ardently sought after, lay many of them empty,\nbecause not even one candidate came forward now to canvass for election.\n\nEvil thoughts surged up within me as I saw these things, that were\ndirect promptings from the nether Gods. \"There must be something\nwanting,\" these tempters whispered, \"in a religion from which so many of\nits Priests fled at the first pinch of persecution.\"\n\nI did what I could to thrust these waverings resolutely behind me; but\nthey refused to be altogether ousted from my brain; and so I made a\ncompromise with myself: First, I would with the help that might be given\nme, destroy this wanton Phorenice, and regain the kingdom which had been\ngiven me to my own proper rule; and afterwards I would call a council\nof the Seven and council of the Three, and consider without prejudice\nif there was any matter in which our ancient ritual could be amended\nto suit the more modern requirements. But this should not be done till\nPhorenice was dead and I was firmly planted in her room. I would not be\na party, even to myself, to any plan which smacked at all of surrender.\n\nAnd there as I walked through the desolate groves and beside the cold\naltars, the High Gods were pleased to show their approval of my scheme,\nand to give me opportunity to bind myself to it with a solemn oath and\nvow. At that moment from His distant resting-place in the East, our Lord\nthe Sun leaped up to begin another day. For long enough from where I\nstood below the crest of the Mountain, He Himself would be invisible.\nBut the great light of His glory spread far into the sky, and against it\nthe Ark of the Mysteries loomed in black outline from the highest crag\nwhere it rested, lonely and terrible.\n\nFor anyone unauthorised to go nearer than a thousand paces to this\nstorehouse of the Highest Mysteries meant instant death. On that day\nwhen I was initiated as one of the Seven, I had been permitted to go\nnear and once press my lips against its ample curves; and the rank of\nmy degree gave me the privilege to repeat that salute again once on each\nday when a new year was born. But what lay inside its great interior,\nand how it was entered, that was hidden from the Seven, even as it was\nfrom the other Priests and the common people in the city below. Only\nthose who had been raised to the sublime elevation of the Three had a\nknowledge of the dreadful powers which were stored within it.\n\nI went down on my knees where I was, and Zaemon knelt beside me, and\ntogether we recited the prayers which had been said by the Priests from\nthe beginning of time, giving thanks to our great Lord that He has\ncome to brighten another day. And then, with my eyes fixed on the black\noutline of the Ark of Mysteries I vowed that, come what might, I at\nleast would be true servant of the High Gods to my life's end, and that\nmy whole strength should be spent in restoring Their worship and glory.\n\n\n\n\n17. NAIS THE REGAINED\n\n\nNow, from where we stood together just below the crest of the Sacred\nMountain, we could see down into the city, which lay spread out below\nus like a map. The harbour and the great estuary gleamed at its\nfarther side; and the fringe of hills beyond smoked and fumed in their\naccustomed fashion; the great stone circle of our Lord the Sun stood\nup grim and bare in the middle of the city; and nearer in reared up the\ngreat mass of the royal pyramid, the gold on its sides catching new gold\nfrom the Sun. There, too, in the square before the pyramid stood the\nthrone of granite, dwarfed by the distance to the size of a mole's hill,\nin which these nine years my love had lain sleeping.\n\nOld Zaemon followed my gaze. \"Ay,\" he said with a sigh, \"I know where\nyour chief interest is. Deucalion when he landed here new from Yucatan\nwas a strong man. The King whom we have chosen--and who is the best we\nhave to choose--has his weakness.\"\n\n\"It can be turned into additional strength. Give me Nais here, living\nand warm to fight for, and I am a stronger man by far than the cold\nviceroy and soldier that you speak about.\"\n\n\"I have passed my word to that already, and you shall have her, but at\nthe cost of damaging somewhat this new kingdom of yours. Maybe too at\nthe same time we may rid you of this Phorenice and her brood. But I do\nnot think it likely. She is too wily, and once we begin our play, she is\nlikely to guess whence it comes, and how it will end, and so will make\nan escape before harm can reach her. The High Gods, who have sent\nall these trials for our refinement, have seen fit to give her some\nknowledge of how these earth tremors may be set a-moving.\"\n\n\"I have seen her juggle with them. But may I hear your scheme?\"\n\n\"It will be shown you in good time enough. But for the present I would\nbid you sleep. It will be your part to go into the city to-night, and\ntake your woman (that is my daughter) when she is set free, and bring\nher here as best you can. And for that you will need all a strong man's\nstrength.\"--He stepped back, and looked me up and down.--\"There are not\nmany folk that would take you for the tidy clean-chinned Deucalion now,\nmy brother. Your appearance will be a fine armour for you down yonder in\nthe city to-night when we wake it with our earth-shaking and terror.\nAs you stand now, you are hairy enough, and shaggy enough, and naked\nenough, and dirty enough for some wild savage new landed out of Europe.\nHave a care that no fine citizen down yonder takes a fancy to your\nthews, and seizes upon you as his servant.\"\n\n\"I somewhat pity him in his household if he does.\"\n\nOld Zaemon laughed. \"Why, come to think of it, so do I.\"\n\nBut quickly he got grave again. Laughter and Zaemon were very rare\nplaymates. \"Well, get you to bed, my King, and leave me to go into the\nArk of Mysteries and prepare there with another of the Three the things\nthat must be done. It is no light business to handle the tremendous\npowers which we must put into movement this night. And there is danger\nfor us as there is for you. So if by chance we do not meet again till we\nstand up yonder behind the stars, giving account to the Gods, fare you\nwell, Deucalion.\"\n\nI slept that day as a soldier sleeps, taking full rest out of the hours,\nand letting no harassing thought disturb me. It is only the weak who\npermit their sleep to be broken on these occasions. And when the dark\nwas well set, I roused and fetched those who should attend to the rope.\nOur Lady the Moon did not shine at that turn of the month: and the air\nwas full of a great blackness. So I was out of sight all the while they\nlowered me.\n\nI reached the tumbled rocks that lay at the deep foot of the cliff,\nand then commenced to use a nice caution, because Phorenice's soldiers\nsquatted uneasily round their camp-fires, as though they had forebodings\nof the coming evil. I had no mind to further stir their wakefulness. So\nI crept swiftly along in the darkest of the shadows, and at last came to\nthe spot where that passage ends which before I had used to get beneath\nthe walls of the city.\n\nThe lamp was in place, and I made my way along the windings swiftly. The\nair, so it seemed to me, was even more noxious with vapours than it had\nbeen when I was down there before, and I judged that Zaemon had already\nbegun to stir those internal activities which were shortly to convulse\nthe city. But again I had difficulty in finding an exit, and this, not\nbecause there were people moving about at the places where I had to come\nout, but because the set of the masonry was entirely changed. In olden\ntimes the Priests' Clan oversaw all the architects' plans, and ruled out\nanything likely to clash with their secret passages and chambers. But\nin this modern day the Priests were of small account, and had no say in\nthis matter, and the architects often through sheer blundering sealed up\nand made useless many of these outlets and hiding-places.\n\nAs it was then, I had to get out of the network of tunnels and galleries\nwhere I could, and not where I would, and in the event found myself at\nthe farther side of the city, almost up to where the outer wall joins\ndown to the harbour. I came out without being seen, careful even in this\nmoment of extremity to preserve the ordinances, and closed all traces of\nexit behind me. The earth seemed to spring beneath my feet like the deck\nof a ship in smooth water; and though there was no actual movement as\nyet to disturb the people, and indeed these slept on in their houses and\nshelters without alarm, I could feel myself that the solid deadness\nof the ground was gone, and that any moment it might break out into\ndevastating waves of movement.\n\nGods! Should I be too late to see the untombing of my love? Would she be\nlaid there bare to the public gaze when presently the people swarmed out\ninto the open spaces through fear at what the great earth tremor might\ncause to fall? I could see, in fancy, their rude, cruel hands thrust\nupon her as she lay there helpless, and my inwards dried up at the\nthought.\n\nI ran madly down and down the narrow winding streets with the one\nthought of coming to the square which lay in front of the royal pyramid\nbefore these things came to pass. With exquisite cruelty I had been\nforced with my own hands to place her alive in her burying-place beneath\nthe granite throne, and if thews and speed could do it, I would not miss\nmy reward of taking her forth again with the same strong hands.\n\nFew disturbed that furious hurry. At first here and there some wretch\nwho harboured in the gutter cried: \"A thief! Throw a share or I pursue.\"\nBut if any of these followed, I do not know. At any rate, my speed then\nmust have out-distanced anyone. Presently, too, as the swing of the\nearth underfoot became more keen, and the stonework of the buildings by\nthe street side began to grate and groan and grit, and sent forth little\nshowers of dust, people began to run with scared cries from out of their\ndoors. But none of these had a mind to stop the ragged, shaggy, savage\nman who ran so swiftly past, and flung the mud from his naked feet.\n\nAnd so in time I came to the great square, and was there none too soon.\nThe place was filling with people who flocked away from the narrow\nstreets, and it was full of darkness, and noise, and dust, and sickness.\nBeneath us the ground rippled in undulations like a sea, which with\nterrifying slowness grew more and more intense.\n\nEver and again a house crashed down unseen in the gloom, and added to\nthe tumult. But the great pyramid had been planned by its old builders\nto stand rude shocks. Its stones were dovetailed into one another with a\nmarvellous cleverness, and were further clamped and joined by ponderous\ntongues of metal. It was a boast that one-half the foundations could be\ndug from beneath it, and still the pyramid would stand four-square under\nheaven, more enduring than the hills.\n\nFlickering torches showed that its great stone doors lay open, and ever\nand again I saw some frightened inmate scurry out and then be lost to\nsight in the gloom. But with the royal pyramid and its ultimate fate\nI had little concern; I did not even care then whether Phorenice was\ntrapped, or whether she came out sound and fit for further mischief.\nI crouched by the granite throne which stood in the middle of that\nsplendid square, and heard its stones grate together like the ends of a\nbroken bone as it rocked to the earth-waves.\n\nIn that night of dust and darkness it was hard to see the outline of\none's own hand, but I think that the Gods in some requital for the love\nwhich had ached so long within me, gave me special power of sight. As\nI watched, I saw the great carved rock which formed the capstone of the\nthrone move slightly and then move again, and then again; a tiny jerk\nfor each earth-pulse, but still there was an appreciable shifting; and,\nmoreover, the stone moved always to one side.\n\nThere was method in Zaemon's desperate work, and this in my blind panic\nof love and haste, I had overlooked. So I went up the steps of the\nthrone on the side from which the great capstone was moving, and clung\nthere afire with expectation.\n\nMore and more violent did the earth-swing grow, though the graduations\nof its increase could not be perceived, and the din of falling houses\nand the shrieks and cries of hurt and frightened people went louder\nup into the night. Thicker grew the dust that filled the air, till one\ncoughed and strangled in the breathing, and more black did the night\nbecome as the dust rose and blotted the rare stars from sight. I clung\nto an angle of the granite throne, crouching on the uppermost step but\none below the capstone, and could scarcely keep my place against the\nviolence of the earth tremors.\n\nBut still the huge capstone that was carved with the snake and the\noutstretched hand held my love fast locked in her living tomb, and I\ncould have bit the cold granite at the impotence which barred me from\nher. The people who kept thronging into the square were mad with\nterror, but their very numbers made my case more desperate every moment.\n\"Phorenice, Goddess, aid us now!\" some cried, and when the prayer\ndid not bring them instant relief, they fell to yammering out the old\nconfessions of the faith which they had learned in childhood, turning\nin this hour of their dreadful need to those old Gods, which, through\nso many dishonourable years, they had spurned and deserted. It was a\ncurious criticism on the balance of their real religion, if one had\ncared to make it.\n\nLouder grew the crash of falling masonry; and from the royal pyramid\nitself, though indeed I could not even see its outline through the\ndarkness, there came sounds of grinding stones and cracking bars of\nmetal which told that even its superb majestic strength had a breaking\nstrain. There came to my mind the threat that old Zaemon had thundered\nforth in that painted, perfumed banqueting-hall: \"You shall see,\" he had\ncried to the Empress, \"this royal pyramid which you have polluted\nwith your debaucheries torn tier from tier, and stone from stone, and\nscattered as feathers spread before a wind!\"\n\nStill heavier grew the surging of the earth, and the pavement of the\ngreat square gaped and upheaved, and the people who thronged it screamed\nstill more shrilly as their feet were crushed by the grinding blocks.\nAnd now too the great pyramid itself was commencing to split, and\ngape, and topple. The roofs of its splendid chambers gave way, and the\nponderous masonry above shuttered down and filled them. In part, too,\none could see the destruction now, and not guess at it merely from the\nfearful hearings of the darkness. Thunders had begun to roar through\nthe black night above, and add their bellowings to this devil's\norchestration of uproar, and vivid lightning splashes lit the flying\ndust-clouds.\n\nIt was perhaps natural that she should be there, but it came as a\nshock when a flare of the lightning showed me Phorenice safe out in the\nsquare, and indeed standing not far from myself.\n\nShe had taken her place in the middle of a great flagstone, and stood\nthere swaying her supple body to the shocks. Her face was calm, and its\nloveliness was untouched by the years. From time to time she brushed\naway the dust as it settled on the short red hair which curled about her\nneck. There was no trace of fear written upon her face. There was some\nweariness, some contempt, and I think a tinge of amusement. Yes, it took\nmore than the crumbling of her royal pyramid to impress Phorenice with\nthe infinite powers of those she warred against.\n\nGods! How the sight of her cool indifference maddened me then. I had\nit in me to have strangled her with my hands if she had come within\nmy reach. But as it was, she stood in her place, swaying easily to the\nearth-waves as a sailor sways on a ship's deck, and beside her, crouched\non the same great flagstone, and overcome with nausea was Ylga, who\nagain was raised to be her fan-girl. It came to my mind that Ylga was\ntwin sister to Nais, and that I owed her for an ancient kindness, but I\nhad leisure to do nothing for her then, and indeed it was little enough\nI could have done. With each shock the great capstone of the throne to\nwhich I clung jarred farther and farther from its bed place, and my love\nwas coming nearer to me. It was she who claimed all my service then.\n\nOnce in their blind panic a knot of the people in the square thought\nthat the granite stone was too solid to be overturned, and saw in it\nan oasis of safety. They flocked towards it, many of them dragging\nthemselves up the steep deep high steps on hands and knees because their\nfeet had been injured by the billowing flagstones of the square.\n\nBut I was in no mood to have the place profaned by their silly\ntremblings and stares: I beat at them with my hands, tearing them away,\nand hurling them back down the steepness of the steps. They asked me\nwhat was my title to the place above their own, and I answered them with\nblows and gnashing teeth. I was careless as to what they thought me or\nwho they thought me. Only I wished them gone. And so they went, wailing\nand crying that I was a devil of the night, for they had no spirit left\nto defend themselves.\n\nFarther and farther the great stone that made the top of the throne slid\nout from its bed, but its slowness of movement maddened me. A life's\neducation left me in that moment, and I had no trace of stately patience\nleft. In my puny fury I thrust at the great block with my shoulder and\nhead, and clawed at it with my hands till the muscles rose on me\nin great ropes and knots, and the High Gods must have laughed at my\nhelplessness as They looked. All was being ordered by the Three who were\nTheir trusted servants, in Their good time. The work of the Gods may be\ndone slowly, but it is done exceeding sure.\n\nBut at last, when all the people of the city were numb with terror,\nand incapable of further emotion (save only for Phorenice who still had\nnerve enough to show no concern), what had been threatened came to pass.\nThe capstone of the throne slid out till it reached the balance, and the\nnext shock threw it with a roar and a clatter to the ground. And then a\nstrange tremor seized me.\n\nAfter all the scheming and effort, what I had so ardently prayed for had\ncome about; but yet my inwards sank at the thought of mounting on the\nstone where I had mounted before, and taking my dear from the hollow\nwhere my hands had laid her. I knew Phorenice's vengefulness, and had a\nhigh value for her cleverness. Had she left Nais to lie in peace, or had\nshe stolen her away to suffer indignities elsewhere? Or had she ended\nher sleep with death, and (as a grisly jest) left the corpse for my\nfinding? I could not tell; I dared not guess. Never during a whole\nhard-fighting life have my emotions been so wrenched as they were at\nthat moment. And, for excuse, it must be owned that love for Nais\nhad sapped my hardihood over a matter in which she was so privately\nconcerned.\n\nIt began to come to my mind, however, that the infernal uproar of the\nearth tremor was beginning to slacken somewhat, as though Zaemon knew\nhe had done the work that he had promised, and was minded to give the\nwretched city a breathing space. So I took my fortitude in hand, and\nclambered up on to the flat of the stone. The lightning flashes had\nceased and all was darkness again and stifling dust, but at any moment\nthe sky might be lit once more, and if I were seen in that place, shaggy\nand changed though I might be, Phorenice, if she were standing near,\nwould not be slow to guess my name and errand.\n\nSo changed was I for the moment, that I will finely confess that the\nidea of a fight was loathsome to me then. I wanted to have my business\ndone and get gone from the place.\n\nWith hands that shook, I fumbled over the face of the stone and found\nthe clamps and bars of metal still in position where I had clenched\nthem, and then reverently I let my fingers pass between these, and felt\nthe curves of my love's body in its rest beneath. An exultation began\nto whirl within me. I did not know if she had been touched since I last\nleft her; I did not know if the drug would have its due effect, and let\nher be awakened to warmth and sight again; but, dead or alive, I had her\nthere, and she was mine, mine, mine, and I could have yelled aloud in my\njoy at her possession.\n\nStill the earth shook beneath us, and masonry roared and crashed into\nruin. I had to cling to my place with one hand, whilst I unhasped the\nclamps of metal that made the top of her prison with the other. But at\nlast I swung the upper half of them clear, and those which pinned down\nher feet I let remain. I stooped and drew her soft body up on to the\nflat of the stone beside me, and pressed my lips a hundred times to the\nface I could not see.\n\nSome mad thought took me, I believe, that the mere fierceness and heat\nof my kisses would bring her back again to life and wakefulness. Indeed\nI will own plainly, that I did but sorry credit to my training in\ncalmness that night. But she lay in my arms cold and nerveless as a\ncorpse, and by degrees my sober wits returned to me.\n\nThis was no place for either of us. Let the earth's tremors cease (as\nwas plainly threatened), let daylight come, and let a few of these\nnerveless people round recover from their panic, and all the great cost\nthat had been expended might be counted as waste. We should be seen,\nand it would not be long before some one put a name to Nais; and then\nit would be an easy matter to guess at Deucalion under the beard and the\nshaggy hair and the browned nakedness of the savage who attended on her.\nTell of fright? By the Gods! I was scared as the veriest trembler who\nblundered amongst the dust-clouds that night when the thought came to\nme.\n\nWith all that ruin spread around, it would be hopeless to think that any\nof those secret galleries which tunnelled under the ground would be left\nunbroken, and so it was useless to try a passage under the walls by the\nold means. But I had heard shouts from that frightened mob which came to\nme through the din and the darkness, that gave another idea for escape.\n\"The city is accursed,\" they had cried: \"if we stay here it will fall\non us. Let us get outside the walls where there are no buildings to bury\nus.\"\n\nIf they went, I could not see. But one gate lay nearest to the royal\npyramid, and I judged that in their panic they would not go farther than\nwas needful. So I put the body of Nais over my shoulder (to leave my\nright arm free) and blundered off as best I could through the stifling\ndarkness.\n\nIt was hard to find a direction; it was hard to walk in the inky\ndarkness over ground that was tossed and tumbled like a frozen sea:\nand as the earth still quaked and heaved, it was hard also to keep a\nfooting. But if I did fall myself a score of times, my dear burden got\nno bruise, and presently I got to the skirts of the square, and found\na street I knew. The most venomous part of the shaking was done, and no\nmore buildings fell, but enough lay sprawled over the roadway to make\nwalking into a climb, and the sweat rolled from me as I laboured along\nmy way.\n\nThere was no difficulty about passing the gate. There was no gate. There\nwas no wall. The Gods had driven their plough through it, and it lay\nflat, and proud Atlantis stood as defenceless as the open country.\nThough I knew the cause of this ruin, though, in fact, I had myself in\nsome measure incited it, I was almost sad at the ruthlessness with which\nit had been carried out. The royal pyramid might go, houses and palaces\nmight be levelled, and for these I cared little enough; but when I saw\nthose stately ramparts also filched away, there the soldier in me woke,\nand I grieved at this humbling of the mighty city that once had been my\nonly mistress.\n\nBut this was only a passing regret, a mere touch of the fighting-man's\npride. I had a different love now, that had wrapped herself round me far\ndeeper and more tightly, and my duty was towards her first and foremost.\nThe night would soon be past, and then dangers would increase. None had\ninterfered with us so far, though many had jostled us as I clambered\nover the ruins; but this forbearance could not be reckoned upon for\nlong. The earth tremors had almost died away, and after the panic and\nthe storm, then comes the time for the spoiling.\n\nAll men who were poor would try to seize what lay nearest to their\nhands, and those of higher station, and any soldiers who could be\ncollected and still remained true to command, would ruthlessly stop and\nstrip any man they saw making off with plunder. I had no mind to clash\nwith these guardians of law and property, and so I fled on swiftly\nthrough the night with my burden, using the unfrequented ways; and\ncrying to the few folk who did meet me that the woman had the plague,\nand would they lend me the shelter of their house as ours had fallen.\nAnd so in time we came to the place where the rope dangled from the\nprecipice, and after Nais had been drawn up to the safety of the Sacred\nMountain, I put my leg in the loop of the rope and followed her.\n\nNow came what was the keenest anxiety of all. We took the girl and laid\nher on a bed in one of the houses, and there in the lit room for the\nfirst time I saw her clearly. Her beauty was drawn and pale. Her eyes\nwere closed, but so thin and transparent had grown the lids that one\ncould almost see the brown of the pupil beneath them. Her hair had grown\nto inordinate thickness and length, and lay as a cushion behind and\nbeside her head.\n\nThere was no flicker of breath; there was none of that pulsing of\nthe body which denotes life; but still she had not the appearance of\nordinary death. The Nais I had placed nine long years before to rest in\nthe hollow of the stone, was a fine grown woman, full bosomed, and well\nboned. The Nais that remained for me was half her weight. The old Nais\nit would have puzzled me to carry for an hour: this was no burden to\nimpede a grown man.\n\nIn other ways too she had altered. The nails of her fingers had grown to\nsuch a great length that they were twisted in spirals, and the fingers\nthemselves and her hands were so waxy and transparent that the bony core\nupon which they were built showed itself beneath the flesh in plain dull\noutline. Her clay-cold lips were so white, that one sighed to remember\nthe full beauty of their carmine. Her shoulders and neck had lost their\ncomely curves, and made bony hollows now in which the dust of entombment\nlodged black and thickly.\n\nReverently I set about preparing those things which if all went well\nshould restore her. I heated water and filled a bath, and tinctured\nit heavily with those essences of the life of beasts which the Priests\nextract and store against times of urgent need and sickness. I laid her\nchin-deep in this bath, and sat beside it to watch, maintaining that\nbath at a constant blood heat.\n\nAn hour I watched; two hours I watched; three hours--and yet she showed\nno flicker of life. The heat of her body given her by the bath, was the\nsame as the heat of my own. But in the feel of her skin when I stroked\nit with my hand, there was something lacking still. Only when our Lord\nthe Sun rose for His day did I break off my watching, whilst I said the\nnecessary prayer which is prescribed, and quickly returned again to the\ngloom of the house.\n\nI was torn with anxiety, and as the time went on and still no sign of\nlife came back, the hope that had once been so high within me began to\nsicken and leave me downcast and despondent. From without, came the\ndin of fighting. Already Phorenice had sent her troops to storm the\npassageway, and the Priests who defended it were shattering them with\nvolleys of rocks. But these sounds of war woke no pulse within me. If\nNais did not wake, then the world for me was ended, and I had no spirit\nleft to care who remained uppermost. The Gods in Their due time will\ndoubtless smite me for this impiety. But I make a confession of it here\non these sheets, having no mind to conceal any portion of this history\nfor the small reason that it does me a personal discredit.\n\nBut as the hours went on, and still no flicker of life came to lessen\nthe dumb agony that racked me, I grew more venturesome, and added more\nessences to the bath, and drugs also such as experience had shown might\nwake the disused tissues into life. I watched on with staring eyes,\nrubbing her wasted body now and again, and always keeping the heat of\nthe bath at a constant. From the first I had barred the door against\nall who would have come near to help me. With my own hands I had laid\nmy love to sleep, and I could not bear that others should rouse her,\nif indeed roused she should ever be. But after those first offers, no\nothers came, and the snarl and din of fighting told of what occupied\nthem.\n\nIt is hard to take note of small changes which occur with infinite\nslowness when one is all the while on the tense watch, and high strung\nthough my senses were, I think there must have been some indication of\nreturning life shown before I was keen enough to notice it. For of a\nsudden, as I gazed, I saw a faint rippling on the surface of the water\nof the bath. Gods! Would it come back again to my love at last--this\nlife, this wakefulness? The ripple died out as it had come, and I\nstooped my head nearer to the bath to try if I could see some faint\nheaving of her bosom some small twitching of the limbs. No, she lay\nthere still without even a flutter of movement. But as I watched, surely\nit seemed to my aching eyes that some tinge was beginning to warm that\nblank whiteness of skin?\n\nHow I filled myself with that sight. The colour was returning to her\nagain beyond a doubt. Once more the dried blood was becoming fluid and\nbeginning again to course in its old channels. Her hair floated out in\nthe liquid of the bath like some brown tangle of the ocean weed, and\never and again it twitched and eddied to some impulse which in itself\nwas too small for the eye to see.\n\nShe had slept for nine long years, and I knew that the wakening could\nbe none of the suddenest. Indeed, it came by its own gradations and\nwith infinite slowness, and I did not dare do more to hasten it. Further\ndrugs might very well stop eternally what those which had been used\nalready had begun. So I sat motionless where I was, and watched the\ncolour come back, and the waxenness go, and even the fullness of her\ncurves in some small measure return. And when growing strength gave\nher power to endure them, and she was racked with those pains which are\ninevitable to being born back again in this fashion to life, I too felt\nthe reflex of her agony, and writhed in loving sympathy.\n\nStill further, too, was I wrung by a torment of doubt as to whether life\nor these rackings would in the end be conqueror. After each paroxysm\nthe colour ebbed back from her again, and for a while she would lie\nmotionless. But strength and power seemed gradually to grow, and at last\nthese prevailed, and drove death and sleep beneath them. Her eyelids\nstruggled with their fastenings. Her lips parted, and her bosom heaved.\nWith shivering gasps her breath began to pant between her reddening\nlips. At first it rattled dryly in her throat, but soon it softened and\nbecame more regular. And then with a last effort her eyes, her glorious\nloving eyes, slowly opened.\n\nI leaned over and called her softly by name.\n\nHer eyes met mine, and a glow arose from their depths that gave me the\ngreatest joy I have met in all the world.\n\n\"Deucalion, my love,\" she whispered. \"Oh, my dear, so you have come for\nme. How I have dreamed of you! How I have been racked! But it was worth\nit all for this.\"\n\n\n\n\n18. STORM OF THE SACRED MOUNTAIN\n\n\nIt was Nais herself who sent me to attend to my sterner duties. The din\nof the attack came to us in the house where I was tending her, and she\nasked its meaning. As pithily as might be, for she was in no condition\nfor tedious listening, I gave her the history of her nine years' sleep.\n\nThe colour flushed more to her face. \"My lord is the properest man in\nall the world to be King,\" she whispered.\n\n\"I refused to touch the trade till they had given me the Queen I\ndesired, safe and alive, here upon the Mountain.\"\n\n\"How we poor women are made the chattels of you men! But, for myself, I\nseem to like the traffic well enough. You should not have let me stand\nin the way of Atlantis' good, Deucalion. Still, it is very sweet to know\nyou were weak there for once, and that I was the cause of your weakness.\nWhat is that bath over yonder? Ah! I remember; my wits seem none of the\nclearest just now.\"\n\n\"You have made the beginning. Your strength will return to you by quick\ndegrees. But it will not bear hurrying. You must have a patience.\"\n\n\"Your ear, sir, for one moment, and then I will rest in peace. My poor\nlooks, are they all gone? You seem to have no mirror here. I had visions\nthat I should wake up wrinkled and old.\"\n\n\"You are as you were, dear, that first night I saw you--the most\nbeautiful woman in all the world.\"\n\n\"I am pleased you like me,\" she said, and took the cup of broth I\noffered her. \"My hair seems to have grown; but it needs combing sadly. I\nhad a fancy, dear, once, that you liked ruddy hair best, and not a plain\nbrown.\" She closed her eyes then, lying back amongst the cushions where\nI had placed her, and dropped off into healthy sleep, with the smiles\nstill playing upon her lips. I put the coverlet over her, and kissed her\nlightly, holding back my beard lest it should sweep her cheek. And then\nI went out of the chamber.\n\nThat beard had grown vastly disagreeable to me these last hours, and\nthen I went into a room in the house, and found instruments, and shaved\nit down to the bare chin. A change of robe also I found there and took\nit instead of my squalid rags. If a man is in truth a king, he owes\nthese things to the dignity of his office.\n\nBut, if the din of the fighting was any guide, mine was a narrowing\nkingdom. Every hour it seemed to grow fiercer and more near, and it was\nclear that some of the gates in the passage up the cleft in the\ncliff, impregnable though all men had thought them, had yielded to the\nvehemence of Phorenice's attack. And, indeed, it was scarcely to be\nmarvelled at. With all her genius spurred on to fury by the blow that\nhad been struck at her by wrecking so fair a part of the city, the\nEmpress would be no light adversary even for a strong place to resist,\nand the Sacred Mountain was no longer strong.\n\nDefences of stone, cunningly planned and mightily built, it still\npossessed, but these will not fight alone. They need men to line them,\nand, moreover, abundance of men. For always in a storm of this kind,\nsome desperate fellows will spit at death and get to hand grips, or\nslingers and archers slip in their shot, or the throwing-fire gets home,\nor (as here) some newfangled machine like Phorenice's fire-tubes, make\none in a thousand of their wavering darts find the life; and so, though\nthe general attacking loses his hundreds, the defenders also are not\nwithout their dead.\n\nThe slaughter, as it turned out, had been prodigious. As fast as the\nstormers came up, the Priests who held the lowest gate remaining to us\nrained down great rocks upon them till the narrow alley of the stair\nwas paved with their writhing dead. But Phorenice stood on a spur of the\nrock below them urging on the charges, and with an insane valour company\nafter company marched up to hurl themselves hopelessly against the\ndefences. They had no machines to batter the massive gates, and their\nattack was as pathetically useless as that of a child who hammers\nagainst a wall with an orange; and meanwhile the terrible stones from\nabove mowed them down remorselessly.\n\nCompany after company of the troops marched into this terrible\ndeath-trap, and not a man of all of them ever came back. Nor was it\nPhorenice's policy that they should do so. In her lust for this final\nconquest, she was minded to pour out troops till she had filled up the\npasses with the slain, so that at last she might march on to a\nlevel fight over the bridge of their poor bodies. It was no part of\nPhorenice's mood ever to count the cost. She set down the object which\nwas to be gained, and it was her policy that the people of Atlantis were\nthere to gain it for her.\n\nTwo gates then had she carried in this dreadful fashion, slaughtering\nthose Priests that stood behind, them who had not been already shot\ndown. And here I came down from above to take my share in the fight.\nThere was no trumpet to announce my coming, no herald to proclaim my\nquality, but the Priests as a sheer custom picked up \"Deucalion!\" as a\nbattle-cry; and some shouted that, with a King to lead, there would be\nno further ground lost.\n\nIt was clear that the name carried to the other side and bore weight\nwith it. A company of poor, doomed wretches who were hurrying up stopped\nin their charge. The word \"Deucalion!\" was bandied round and handed\nback down the line. I thought with some grim satisfaction, that here was\nevidence I was not completely forgotten in the land.\n\nThere came shouts to them from behind to carry on their advance; but\nthey did not budge; and presently a glittering officer panted up, and\ncommenced to strike right and left amongst them with his sword. From\nwhere I stood on the high rampart above the gate, I could see him\nplainly, and recognised him at once.\n\n\"It matters not what they use for their battle-cry,\" he was shouting.\n\"You have the orders of your divine Empress, and that is enough. You\nshould be proud to die for her wish, you cowards. And if you do not\nobey, you will die afterwards under the instruments of the tormentors,\nvery painfully. As for Deucalion, he is dead any time these nine years.\"\n\n\"There it seems you lie, my Lord Tatho,\" I shouted down to him.\n\nHe started, and looked up at me.\n\n\"So you are there in real truth, then? Well, old comrade, I am sorry.\nBut it is too late to make a composition now. You are on the side of\nthese mangy Priests, and the Empress has made an edict that they are to\nbe rooted out, and I am her most obedient servant.\"\n\n\"You used to be skilful of fence,\" I said, and indeed there was little\nenough to choose between us. \"If it please you to stop this pitiful\nkilling, make yourself the champion of your side, and I will stand for\nmine, and we will fight out this quarrel in some fair place, and bind\nour parties to abide by the result.\"\n\n\"It would be a grand fight between us two, old friend, and it goes hard\nwith me to balk you of it. But I cannot pleasure you. I am general here\nunder Phorenice, and she has given me the strongest orders not to peril\nmyself. And besides, though you are a great man, Deucalion, you are not\nchief. You are not even one of the Three.\"\n\n\"I am King.\"\n\nTatho laughed. \"Few but yourself would say so, my lord.\"\n\n\"Few truly, but what there are, they are powerful. I was given the name\nfor the first time yesterday, and as a first blow in the campaign there\nwas some mischief done in the city. I was there myself, and saw how you\ntook it.\"\n\n\"You were in Atlantis!\"\n\n\"I went for Nais. She is on the mountain now, and to-morrow will be my\nQueen. Tatho, as a priest to a priest, let me solemnly bring to your\nmemory the infinite power you bite against on this Sacred Mountain. Your\nteaching has warned you of the weapons that are stored in the Ark of\nthe Mysteries. If you persist in this attack, at the best you can merely\nlose; at the worst you can bring about a wreck over which even the High\nGods will shudder as They order it.\"\n\n\"You cannot scare us back now by words,\" said Tatho doggedly. \"And\nas for magic, it will be met by magic. Phorenice has found by her own\ncleverness as many powers as were ever stored up in the Ark of the\nMysteries.\"\n\n\"Yet she looked on helplessly enough last night, when her royal pyramid\nwas trundled into a rubbish heap. Zaemon had prophesied that this should\nbe so, and for a witness, why I myself stood closer to her than we two\nstand now, and saw her.\"\n\n\"I will own you took her by surprise somewhat there. I do not understand\nthese matters myself; I was never more than one of the Seven in the old\ndays; and now, quite rightly, Phorenice keeps the knowledge of her magic\nto herself: but it seems time is needed when one magic is to be met by\nanother.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I know little about the business either. I leave these\nmatters now to those who are higher above me in the priesthood. Indeed,\nhaving a liking for Nais, it seems I am debarred from ever being given\nunderstanding about the highest of the higher Mysteries. So I content\nmyself with being a soldier, and when the appointed day comes, I shall\nfall and kiss my mother the Earth for the last time. You, so I am told,\nhave ambition for longer life.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Phorenice has found the Great Secret, and I am to be the\nfirst that will share it with her. We shall be as Gods upon the earth,\nseeing that Death will be powerless to touch us. And the twin sons she\nhas borne me, will be made immortal also.\"\n\n\"Phorenice is headstrong. No, my lord, there is no need to shake your\nhead and try to deny it. I have had some acquaintance with her. But the\norder has been made, and her immortality will be snatched from her very\nrudely. Now, mark solemnly my words. I, Deucalion, have been appointed\nKing of Atlantis by the High Council of the Priests who are the\nmouthpiece of the most High Gods, and if I do not have my reign, then\nthere will be no Atlantis left to carry either King or Empress. You know\nme, Tatho, for a man that never lies.\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Then save yourself before it is too late. You shall have again your\nvice-royalty in Yucatan.\"\n\n\"But, man, there is no Yucatan. A great horde of little hairy creatures,\nthat were something less than human and something more than beasts,\nswept down upon our cities and ate them out. Oh, you may sneer if you\nchoose! Others sneered when I came home, till the Empress stopped them.\nBut you know what a train of driver ants is, that you meet with in the\nforests? You may light fires across their path, and they will march into\nthem in their blind bravery, and put them out with their bodies, and\nthose that are left will march on in an unbroken column, and devour\nall that stands in their path. I tell you, my lord, those little hairy\ncreatures were like the ants--aye, for numbers, and wooden bravery, as\nwell as for appetite. As a result to-day, there is no Yucatan.\"\n\n\"You shall have Egypt, then.\"\n\nHe burst at me hotly. \"I would not take seven Egypts and ten Yucatans.\nMy lord, you think more poorly of me than is kind, when you ask me to\nbecome a traitor. In your place would you throw your Nais away, if the\ndoing it would save you from a danger?\"\n\n\"That is different.\"\n\n\"In no degree. You have a kindness for her. I have all that and more for\nPhorenice, who is, besides, my wife and the mother of my children. If I\nhave qualms--and I freely confess I know you are desperate men up there,\nand have dreadful powers at your command--my shiverings are for them and\nnot for myself. But I think, my lord, this parley is leading to nothing,\nand though these common soldiers here will understand little enough of\nour talk, they may be picking up a word here and there, and I do not\nwish them to go on to their death (as you will see them do shortly)\nand carry evil reports about me to whatever Gods they chance to come\nbefore.\"\n\nHe saluted me with his sword and drew back, and once more the missiles\nbegan to fly, and the doomed wretches, who had been halting beside\nthe steep rock walls of the pass began once more to press hopelessly\nforward. They had scaling-ladders certainly, but they had no chance of\ngetting these planted. They could do naught but fill the narrow way with\ntheir bodies, and to that end they had been sent, and to that end\nthey humbly died. Our Priests with crow and lever wrenched from their\nlodging-places the great rocks which had been made ready, and sent them\ncrashing down, so that once more screams filled the pass, and the horrid\nbutchery was renewed.\n\nBut ever and again, some arrow or some sling-stone, or some fire-tube's\ndart would find its way up from below and through the defences, and\nthere we would be with a man the less to carry on the fight. It was well\nenough for Phorenice to be lavish with her troops; indeed, if she wished\nfor success, there were no two ways for it; and when those she had\nlevied were killed, she could readily press others into the service,\nseeing that she had the whole broad face of the country under her rule.\nBut with us it was different. A man down on our side was a man whose\narm would bitterly be missed, and one which could in no possible way be\nreplaced.\n\nI made calculation of the chances, and saw clearly that, if we continued\nthe fight on the present plan, they would storm the gates one after\nanother as they came to them, and that by the time the uppermost gate\nwas reached, there would be no Priest alive to defend it. And so, not\ndisdaining to fashion myself on Phorenice's newer plan, which held that\na general should at times in preference plot coldly from a place of some\nsafety, and not lead the thick of the fighting, I left those who stood\nto the gate with some rough soldier's words of cheer, and withdrew again\nup the narrow stair of the pass.\n\nThis one approach to the Sacred Mountain was, as I have said before,\nvastly more difficult and dangerous in the olden days when it stood as\na mere bare cleft as the High Gods made it. But a chasm had been bridged\nhere, a shelf cut through the solid rock there, and in many places the\nroadway was built up on piers from distant crags below so as to make all\nuniform and easy. It came to my mind now, that if I could destroy this\npath, we might gain a breathing space for further effort.\n\nThe idea seemed good, or at least no other occurred to me which would\nin any way relieve our desperate situation, and I looked around me for\nmeans to put it into execution. Up and down, from the mountain to the\nplains below, I had traversed that narrow stair of a pass some thousands\nof times, and so in a manner of speaking knew every stone, and every\nturn, and every cut of it by heart. But I had never looked upon it with\nan eye to shaving off all roadway to the Sacred Mountain, and so now,\neven in this moment of dreadful stress, I had to traverse it no less\nthan three times afresh before I could decide upon the best site for\ndemolition.\n\nBut once the point was fixed, there was little delay in getting the\nscheme in movement. Already I had sent men to the storehouses amongst\nthe Priests' dwellings to fetch me rams, and crows, and acids, and\nhammers, and such other material as was needed, and these stood handy\nbehind one of the upper gates. I put on every pair of hands that could\nbe spared to the work, no matter what was their age and feebleness;\nyes, if Nais could have walked so far I would have pressed her for the\nlabour; and presently carved balustrade, and wayside statue, together\nwith the lettered wall-stones and the foot-worn cobbles, roared down\ninto the gulf below, and added their din to the shrieks and yells and\ncrashes of the fighting. Gods! But it was a hateful task, smashing down\nthat splendid handiwork of the men of the past. But it was better that\nit should crash down to ruin in the abyss below, than that Phorenice\nshould profane it with her impious sandals.\n\nAt first I had feared that it would be needful to sacrifice the knot of\nbrave men who were so valiantly defending the gate then being attacked.\nIt is disgusting to be forced into a measure of this kind, but in hard\nwarfare it is often needful to the carrying out of his schemes for a\ngeneral to leave a part of his troops to fight to a finish, and without\nhope of rescue, as valiantly as they may; and all he can do for their\nreward is to recommend them earnestly to the care of the Gods. But when\nthe work of destroying the pathway was nearly completed, I saw a chance\nof retrieving them.\n\nWe had not been content merely with breaking arches, and throwing down\nthe piers. We had got our rams and levers under the living rock itself\non which all the whole fabric stood; and fire stood ready to heat the\nrams for their work; and when the word was given, the whole could be\nsent crashing down the face of the cliffs beyond chance of repair.\n\nAll was, I say, finally prepared in this fashion, and then I gave the\nword to hold. A narrow ledge still remained undestroyed, and offered\nfootway, and over this I crossed. The cut we had made was immediately\nbelow the uppermost gate of all, and below it there were three more\nmassive gates still unviolated, besides the one then being so vehemently\nattacked. Already, the garrisons had been retired from these, and I\npassed through them all in turn, unchallenged and unchecked, and came to\nthat busy rampart where the twelve Priests left alive worked, stripped\nto the waist, at heaving down the murderous rocks.\n\nFor awhile I busied myself at their side, stopping an occasional\nfire-tube dart or arrow on my shield and passing them the tidings. The\nattack was growing fiercer every minute now. The enemy had packed the\npass below well-nigh full of their dead, and our battering stones had\nless distance to fall and so could do less execution. They pressed\nforward more eagerly than ever with their scaling ladders, and it was\nplain that soon they would inevitably put the place to the storm. Even\nduring the short time I was there, their sling-stones and missiles took\nlife from three more of the twelve who stood with me on the defence.\n\nSo I gave the word for one more furious avalanche of rock to be pelted\ndown, and whilst the few living were crawling out from those killed\nby the discharge, and whilst the next band of reinforcements came\nscrambling up over the bodies, I sent my nine remaining men away at a\nrun up the steep stairway of the path, and then followed them myself.\nEach of the gates in turn we passed, shutting them after us, and\nbreaking the bars and levers with which they were moved, and not till\nwe were through the last did the roar of shouts from below tell that the\nbesiegers had found the gate they bit against was deserted.\n\nOne by one we balanced our way across the narrow ledge which was left\nwhere the path had been destroyed, and one poor Priest that carried a\nwound grew giddy, and lost his balance here, and toppled down to his\ndeath in the abyss below before a hand could be stretched out to steady\nhim. And then, when we were all over, heat was put to the rams, and they\nexpanded with their resistless force, and tore the remaining ledges from\ntheir hold in the rock. I think a pang went through us all then when\nwe saw for ourselves the last connecting link cut away from between the\npoor remaining handful of our Sacred Clan on the Mountain, and the rest\nof our great nation, who had grown so bitterly estranged to us, below.\n\nBut here at any rate was a break in the fighting. There were no further\npreparations we could make for our defence, and high though I knew\nPhorenice's genius to be, I did not see how she could very well do other\nthan accept the check and retire. So I set a guard on the ramparts of\nthe uppermost gate to watch all possible movements, and gave the word to\nthe others to go and find the rest which so much they needed.\n\nFor myself, dutifully I tried to find Zaemon first, going on the errand\nmy proper self, for there was little enough of kingly state observed on\nthe Sacred Mountain, although the name and title had been given me.\nBut Zaemon was not to be come at. He was engaged inside the Ark of the\nMysteries with another of the Three, and being myself only one of the\nSeven, I had not rank enough in the priesthood to break in upon their\nworkings. And so I was free to turn where my likings would have led me\nfirst, and that was to the house which sheltered Nais.\n\nShe waked as I came in over the threshold, and her eyes filled with a\nwelcome for me. I went across and knelt where she lay, putting my\nface on the pillow beside her. She was full of tender talk and sweet\nendearments. Gods! What an infinity of delight I had missed by not\nknowing my Nais earlier! But she had a will of her own through it all,\nand some quaint conceits which made her all the more adorable. She\nrallied me on the new cleanness of my chin, and on the robe which I had\ntaken as a covering. She professed a pretty awe for my kingship, and\nvowed that had she known of my coming dignities she would never have\ndared to discover a love for me. But about my marriage with Phorenice\nshe spoke with less lightness. She put out her thin white hand, and drew\nmy face to her lips.\n\n\"It is weak of me to have a jealousy,\" she murmured, \"knowing how\ncompletely my lord is mine alone; but I cannot help it. You have said\nyou were her husband for awhile. It gives me a pang to think that I\nshall not be the first to lie in your arms, Deucalion.\"\n\n\"Then you may gaily throw your pang away,\" I whispered back. \"I was\nhusband to Phorenice in mere word for how long I do not precisely know.\nBut in anything beyond, I was never her husband at all. She married\nme by a form she prescribed herself, ignoring all the old rites and\nceremonies, and whether it would hold as legal or not, we need not\ntrouble to inquire. She herself has most nicely and completely annulled\nthat marriage as I have told you. Tatho is her husband now, and father\nto her children, and he seems to have a fondness for her which does him\ncredit.\"\n\nWe said other things too in that chamber, those small repetitions\nof endearments which are so precious to lovers, and so beyond the\ncomprehension of other folk, but they are not to be set down on these\nsheets. They are a mere private matter which can have no concern to\nany one beyond our two selves, and more weighty subjects are piling\nthemselves up in deep index for the historian.\n\nPhorenice, it seemed, had more rage against the Priests' Clan on the\nMountain and more bright genius to help her to a vengeance than I had\ncredited. Her troops stormed easily the gates we had left to them, and\nswarmed up till they stood where the pathway was broken down. In the\nfierceness of their rush, the foremost were thrust over the brink by\nthose pressing up behind, before the advance could be halted, and these\nwent screaming to a horrid death in the great gulf below. But it was no\nposition here that a lavish spending of men could take, and presently\nall were drawn off, save for some half-score who stood as outpost\nsentries, and dodged out of arrow-shot behind angles of the rock.\n\nIt seems, too, that the Empress herself reconnoitered the place, using\ndue caution and quickness, and so got for herself a full plan of its\nrequirements without being obliged to trust the measuring of another\neye. With extraordinary nimbleness she must have planned an engine such\nas was necessary to suit her purposes, and given orders for its making;\nfor even with the vast force and resources at her disposal, the speed\nwith which it was built was prodigious.\n\nThere was very little noise made to tell of what was afoot. All the\nwoodwork and metalwork was cut, and tongued, and forged, and fitted\nfirst by skilled craftsmen below, in the plain at the foot of the cleft;\nand when each ponderous balk and each crosspiece, and each plank was\ndragged up the steep pass through the conquered gates, it was ready\ninstantly for fitting into its appointed place in the completed machine.\n\nThe cleft was straight where they set about their building, and there\nwas no curve or spur of the cliff to hide their handiwork from those of\nthe Priests who watched from the ramparts above our one remaining gate.\nBut Phorenice had a coyness lest her engine should be seen before it\nwas completed, and so to screen it she had a vast fire built at the\nuppermost point where the causeway was broken off, and fed diligently\nwith wet sedge and green wood, so that a great smoke poured out, rising\nlike a curtain that shut out all view. And so though the Priests on the\nrampart above the gate picked off now and again some of those who tended\nthe fire, they could do the besiegers no further injury, and remained up\nto the last quite in ignorance of their tactics.\n\nThe passage up the cleft was in shadow during the night hours, for,\nthough all the crest of the Sacred Mountain was always lit brightly by\nthe eternal fires which made its defence on the farther side, their glow\nthrew no gleam down that flank where the cliff ran sheer to the plains\nbeneath. And so it was under cover of the darkness that Phorenice\nbrought up her engine into position for attack.\n\nPlanking had been laid down for its wheels, and the wheels themselves\nwell greased, and it may be that she hoped to march in upon us whilst\nall slept. But there was a certain creaking and groaning of timbers,\nand laboured panting of men, which gave advertisement that something was\nbeing attempted, and the alarm was spread quietly in the hope that if a\nsurprise had been planned, the real surprise might be turned the other\nway.\n\nA messenger came to me running, where I sat in the house at the side of\nmy love, and she, like the soldier's wife she was made to be, kissed me\nand bade me go quickly and care for my honour, and bring back my wounds\nfor her to mend.\n\nOn the rampart above the gate all was silence, save for the faint rustle\nof armed men, and out of the black darkness ahead, and from the other\nside of the broken causeway, came the sounds of which the messenger bad\nwarned me.\n\nThe captain of the gate came to me and whispered: \"We have made no light\ntill the King came, not knowing the King's will in the matter. Is it\nwished I send some of the throwing-fire down yonder, on the chance that\nit does some harm, and at the same time lights up the place? Or is it\nwilled that we wait for their surprise?\"\n\n\"Send the fire,\" I said, \"or we may find that Phorenice's brain has been\none too many for us.\"\n\nThe captain of the gate took one of the balls in his hand, lit the fuse,\nand hurled it. The horrid thing burst amongst a mass of men who were\nlabouring with a huge engine, sputtering them with its deadly fire, and\nlighting their garments. The plan of the engine showed itself plainly.\nThey had built them a vast great tower, resting on wheels at its base,\nso that it might by pushed forward from behind, and slanting at its foot\nto allow for the steepness of the path and leave it always upright.\n\nIt was storeyed inside, with ladders joining each floor, and through\nslits in the side which faced us bowmen could cover an attack. From its\ntop a great bridge reared high above it, being carried vertically till\nthe tower was brought near enough for its use. The bridge was hinged at\nthe third storey of the tower, and fastened with ropes to its extreme\ntop; but, once the ropes were cut, the bridge would fall, and light upon\nwhatever came within its swing, and be held there by the spikes with\nwhich it was studded beneath.\n\nI saw, and inwardly felt myself conquered. The cleverness of Phorenice\nhad been too strong for my defence. No war-engine of which we had\ncommand could overset the tower. The whole of its massive timbers\nwere hung with the wet new-stripped skins of beasts, so that even the\nthrowing-fire could not destroy it. What puny means we had to impede\nthose who pushed it forward would have little effect. Presently it would\ncome to the place appointed, and the ropes would be cut, and the bridge\nwould thunder down on the rampart above our last gate, and the stormers\nwould pour out to their final success.\n\nWell, life had loomed very pleasant for me these few days with a warm\nand loving Nais once more in touch of my arms, but the High Gods in\nTheir infinite wisdom knew best always, and I was no rebel to stay\nstiff-necked against their decision. But it is ever a soldier's\nprivilege, come what may, to warm over a fight, and the most exquisitely\nfierce joy of all is that final fight of a man who knows that he must\ndie, and who lusts only to make his bed of slain high enough to carry a\ndue memory of his powers with those who afterwards come to gaze upon it.\nI gripped my axe, and the muscles of my arms stood out in knots at the\nthought of it. Would Tatho come to give me sport? I feared not. They\nwould send only the common soldiers first to the storm, and I must be\ncontent to do my killing on those.\n\nAnd Nais, what of her? I had a quiet mind there. When any spoilers came\nto the house where she lay, she would know that Deucalion had been taken\nup to the Gods, and she would not be long in following him. She had her\ndagger. No, I had no fears of being parted long from Nais now.\n\n\n\n\n19. DESTRUCTION OF ATLANTIS\n\n\nA tottering old Priest came up and touched me on the shoulder.\n\n\"Well?\" I said sharply, having small taste for interruption just now.\n\n\"News has been carried to the Three, my King, of what is threatened.\"\n\n\"Then they will know that I stand here now, brother, to enjoy the finest\nfight of my life. When it is finished I shall go to the Gods, and be\nthere standing behind the stars to welcome them when presently they also\narrive. They have my regrets that they are too old and too feeble to die\nand look upon a fine killing themselves.\"\n\n\"I have commands from them, my King, to lay upon you, which I fear you\nwill like but slenderly. You are forbidden to find your death here in\nthe fighting. They have a further use for you yet.\"\n\nI turned on the old man angrily enough. \"I shall take no such order,\nmy brother. I am not going to believe it was ever given. You must have\nmisunderstood. If I am a man, if I am a Priest, if I am a soldier, if\nI am a King, then it stands to my honour that no enemy should pass this\ngate whilst yet I live. And you may go back and throw that message at\ntheir teeth.\"\n\nThe old man smiled enviously. He, too, had been a keen soldier in his\nday. \"I told them you would not easily believe such a message, and asked\nthem for a sign, and they bore with me, and gave me one. I was to give\nyou this jewel, my King.\"\n\n\"How came they by that? It is a bracelet from the elbow of Nais.\"\n\n\"They must have stripped her of it. I did not know it came from Nais.\nThe word I was to bring you said that the owner of the jewel was inside\nthe Ark of the Mysteries, and waited you there. The use which the Three\nhave for you further concerns her also.\"\n\nEven when I heard that, I will freely confess that my obedience was\nsorely tried, and I have the less shame in setting it down on these\nsheets, because I know that all true soldiers will feel a sympathy for\nmy plight. Indeed, the promise of the battle was very tempting. But in\nthe end my love for Nais prevailed, and I gave the salutation that was\nneedful in token that I heard the order and obeyed it.\n\nTo the knot of Priests who were left for the defence, I turned and made\nmy farewells. \"You will have what I shall miss, my brothers,\" I said. \"I\nenvy you that fight. But, though I am King of Atlantis, still I am only\none of the Seven, and so am the servant of the Three and must obey their\norder. They speak in words the will of the most High Gods, and we must\ndo as they command. You will stand behind the stars before I come, and\nI ask of you that you will commend me to Those you meet there. It is not\nmy own will that I shall not appear there by your side.\"\n\nThey heard my words with smiles, and very courteously saluted me with\ntheir weapons, and there we parted. I did not see the fight, but I know\nit was good, from the time which passed before Phorenice's hordes broke\nout on to the crest of the Mountain. They died hard, that last remnant\nof the lesser Priests of Atlantis.\n\nWith a sour enough feeling I went up to the head of the pass, and then\nthrough the groves, and between the temples and colleges and houses\nwhich stood on the upper slopes of the Sacred Mountain, till I reached\nthat boundary, beyond which in milder days it was death for any but the\nprivileged few to pass. But the time, it appeared to me, was past for\nconventions, and, moreover, my own temper was hot; and it is likely\nthat I should have strode on with little scruple if I had not been\ninterrupted. But in the temple which marked the boundary, there was old\nZaemon waiting; and he, with due solemnity of words, and with the whole\nof some ancient ritual ordained for that purpose, sought dispensation\nfrom the High Gods for my trespass, and would not give me way till he\nwas through with his ceremony.\n\nAlready Phorenice's tower and bridge were in position, for the clash and\nyelling of a fight told that the small handful of Priests on the rampart\nof the last gate were bartering their lives for the highest return in\ndead that they could earn. They were trained fighting men all, but old\nand feeble, and the odds against them were too enormous to be stemmed\nfor over long. In a very short time the place would be put to the storm,\nand the roof of the Sacred Mountain would be at the open mercy of the\ninvader. If there was any further thing to be done, it was well that it\nshould be set about quickly whilst peace remained. It seemed to me\nthat the moment for prompt action, and the time for lengthy pompous\nceremonial was done for good.\n\nBut Zaemon was minded otherwise. He led me up to the Ark of the\nMysteries, and chided my impatience, and waited till I had given it my\nreverential kiss, and then he called aloud, and another old man came\nout of the opening which is in the top of the Ark, and climbed painfully\ndown by the battens which are fixed on its sides. He was a man I had\nnever seen before, hoary, frail, and emaciated, and he and Zaemon were\nthen the only two remaining Priests who had been raised to the highest\ndegree known to our Clan, and who alone had knowledge of the highest\nsecrets and powers and mysteries.\n\n\"Look!\" cried Zaemon, in his shrill old voice, and swept a trembling\nfinger over the shattered city, and the great spread of sea and country\nwhich lay in view of us below. I followed his pointing and looked, and a\nchill began to crawl through me. All was plainly shown. Our Lord the Sun\nburned high overhead in a sky of cloudless blue, and day shimmered in\nHis heat. All below seemed from that distance peaceful and warm and\nstill, save only that the mountains smoked more than ordinary, and some\nspouted fires, and that the sea boiled with some strange disorder.\n\nBut it was the significance of the sea that troubled me most. Far out on\nthe distant coast it surged against the rocks in enormous rolls of surf;\nand up the great estuary, at the head of which the city of Atlantis\nstands, it gushed in successive waves of enormous height which never\nreturned. Already the lower lands on either side were blotted out\nbeneath tumultuous waters, the harbour walls were drowned out of sight,\nand the flood was creeping up into the lower wards of the great city\nitself.\n\n\"You have seen?\" asked Zaemon.\n\n\"I have seen.\"\n\n\"You understand?\"\n\n\"In part.\"\n\n\"Then let me tell you all. This is the beginning, and the end will\nfollow swiftly. The most High Gods, that sit behind the stars, have a\nlimit to even Their sublime patience; and that has been passed. The city\nof Atlantis, the great continent that is beyond, and all that are in\nthem are doomed to unutterable destruction. Of old it was foreseen that\nthis great wiping-out would happen through the sins of men, and to this\nend the Ark of the Mysteries was built under the direction of the Gods.\nNo mortal implements can so much as scratch its surface, no waves or\nrocks wreck it. Inside is stored on sheets of the ancient writing all\nthat is known in the world of learning that is not shared by the\ncommon people, also there is grain in a store, and sweet water in tanks\nsufficient for two persons for the space of four years, together with\nseeds, weapons, and all such other matters as were deemed fit.\n\n\"Out of all this vast country it has been decreed by the High Gods that\ntwo shall not perish. Two shall be chosen, a man and a woman, who are\nfit and proper persons to carry away with them the ancient learning to\ndispose of it as they see best, and afterwards to rear up a race who\nshall in time build another kingdom and do honour to our Lord the\nSun and the other Gods in another place. The woman is within the Ark\nalready, and seated in the place appointed for her, and though she is a\ndaughter of mine, the burden of her choosing is with you. For the man,\nthe choice has fallen upon yourself.\"\n\nI was half numb with the shock of what was befalling. \"I do not know\nthat I care to be a survivor.\"\n\n\"You are not asked for your wishes,\" said the old man. \"You are given an\norder from the High Gods, who know you to be Their faithful servant.\"\n\nHabit rode strong upon me. I made salutation in the required form, and\nsaid that I heard and would obey.\n\n\"Then it remains to raise you to the sublime degree of the Three, and if\nyour learning is so small that you will not understand the keys to many\nof the Powers, and the highest of the Mysteries, when they are handed to\nyou, that fault cannot be remedied now.\"\n\nCertainly the time remaining was short enough. The fight still raged\ndown at the gate in the pass, though it was a wonder how the handful of\nPriests had held their ground so long. But the ocean rolled in upon the\nland in an ever-increasing flood, and the mountains smoked and belched\nforth more volleys of rock as the weight increased on their lower parts,\nand presently those that besieged the Mountain could not fail to see\nthe fate that threatened them. Then there would be no withholding their\nrush. In their mad fury and panic they would sweep all obstruction\nresistlessly before them, and those who stood in their path might look\nto themselves.\n\nBut there was no hurrying Zaemon and his fellow sage. They were without\ntemple for the ceremony, without sacrifice or incense to decorate it.\nThey had but the sky for a roof to make their echoes, and the Gods\nthemselves for witnesses. But they went through the work of raising\nme to their own degree, with all the grand and majestic form which has\ngathered dignity from the ages, and by no one sentence did they curtail\nit. A burning mountain burst with a bellowing roar as the incoming\nwaters met its fires, but gravely they went on, in turn reciting their\nsentences. Phorenice's troops broke down the last resistance, and poured\nin a frenzied stream amongst the groves and temples, but still they\nquavered never in the ritual.\n\nIt had been said that this ceremony is the grandest and the most\nimpressive of all those connected with our holy religion; and certainly\nI found it so; and I speak as one intimate with all the others. Even the\ntremendous circumstances which hemmed them in could do nothing to make\nthese frail old men forget the deference which was due to the highest\norder of the Clan.\n\nFor myself, I will freely own I was less rapt. I stood there bareheaded\nin the heat, a man trying to concentrate himself, and yet torn the while\nby a thousand foreign emotions. The awful thing that was happening all\naround compelled some of my attention. A continent was in the very act\nand article of meeting with complete destruction, and if Zaemon and\nthe other Priest were strong enough to give their minds wholly up to a\nmatter parochial to the priesthood, I was not so stoical. And moreover,\nI was filled with other anxieties and thoughts concerning Nais. Yet I\nmanaged to preserve a decent show of attention to the ceremony; making\nall those responses which were required of me; and trying as well as\nmight be to preserve in my mind those sentences which were the keys to\npower and learning, and not mere phrasings of grandeur and devotion.\n\nBut it became clear that if the ceremony of my raising did not soon\narrive at its natural end, it would be cut short presently with\nsomething of suddenness. Phorenice's conquering legions swarmed out\non to the crest of the Mountain, and now carried full knowledge of the\ndreadful thing that was come upon the country. They were out of all\ncontrol, and ran about like men distracted; but knowing full well that\nthe Priests would have brought this terrible wreck to pass by virtue of\nthe powers which were stored within the Ark of the Mysteries, it would\nbe their natural impulse to pour out a final vengeance upon any of these\nsame Priests they could come across before it was too late.\n\nIt began to come to my mind that if the ceremony did not very shortly\nterminate, the further part of the plan would stand very small chance\nof completion, and I should come by my death after all by fighting to a\nfinish, as I had pictured to myself before. My flickering attention saw\nthe soldiers coming always nearer in their frantic wanderings, and saw\nalso the sea below rolling deeper and deeper in upon the land.\n\nThe fires, too, which ringed in half the mountain, spurted up to\ndouble their old height, and burned with an unceasing roar. But for all\ndistraction these things gave to the two old Priests who were raising\nme, we might have been in the quietness of some ancient temple, with no\nso much as a fly to buzz an interruption.\n\nBut at last an end came to the ceremony. \"Kneel,\" cried Zaemon, \"and\nmake obeisance to your mother the Earth, and swear by the High Gods that\nyou will never make improper use of the powers over Her which this day\nyou have been granted.\"\n\nWhen I had done that, he bade me rise as a fully installed and duly\ninitiated member of the Three. \"You will have no opportunity to practise\nthe workings of this degree with either of us, my brother,\" said he,\n\"for presently our other brother and I go to stand before the Gods to\ndeliver to Them an account of our trust, and of how we have carried it\nout. But what items you remember here and there may turn of use to you\nhereafter. And now we two give you our farewells, and promise to commend\nyou highly to the Gods when soon we meet Them in Their place behind\nthe stars. Climb now into the Ark, and be ready to shut the door which\nguards it, if there is any attempt by these raging people to invade that\nalso. Remember, my brother, it is the Gods' direct will that you and the\nwoman Nais go from this place living and sound, and you are expressly\nforbidden to accept challenge or provocation to fight on any pretext\nwhatever. But as long as may be done in safety, you may look out upon\nAtlantis in her death-throes. It is very fitting that one of the only\ntwo who are sent hence alive, should carry the full tale of what has\nbefallen.\"\n\nI went to the top of the Ark of Mysteries then, climbing there by the\nbattens which are fastened to the sides, and then descended by the stair\nwhich is inside and found Nais in a little chamber waiting for me.\n\n\"I was bidden stay here by Zaemon,\" she said, \"who forced me to this\nplace by threats and also by promises that my lord would follow. He is\nvery ungentle, that father of mine, but I think he has a kindness for us\nboth, and any way he is my father and I cannot help loving him. Is there\nno chance to save him from what is going to happen?\"\n\n\"He will not come into this Ark, for I asked him. It has been ordained\nfrom the ancient time when first the Ark was built, that when the day\nfor its purpose came, one woman and one man should be its only tenants,\nand they are here already. Zaemon's will in the matter is not to be\ntwisted by you or by me. He has a message to be delivered to the Gods,\nand (if I know him at all), he grudges every minute that is lost in\ncarrying it to them.\"\n\nI left her then, and went out again up the stair, and stood once more on\nthe roof of the Ark. On the Mountain top men still ran about distracted,\nbut gradually they were coming to where the Ark rested on the highest\npoint. For the moment, however, I passed them lightly. The drowning of\nthe great continent that had been spread out below filled the eye. Ocean\nroared in upon it with still more furious waves. The plains and the\nlevel lands were foaming lakes. The great city of Atlantis had vanished\neternally. The mountains alone kept their heads above the flood, and\nspewed out rocks, and steam, and boiling stone, or burst when the waters\nreached them and created great whirlpools of surging sea, and twisted\ntrees, and bubbling mud.\n\nIn the space of a few breaths every living creature that dwelt in the\nlower grounds had been smothered by the waters, save for a few who\nhuddled in a pair of galleys that were driven oarless inland, over what\nhad once been black forest and hunting land for the beasts. And even as\nI watched, these also were swallowed up by the horrid turmoil of sea,\nand nothing but the sea beasts, and those of the greater lizards which\ncan live in such outrageous waters, could have survived even that\nstate of the destruction. Indeed, none but those men who had now found\nstanding-ground on the upper slopes of the Sacred Mountain survived,\nand it was plain that their span was short, for the great mass of the\ncontinent sank deeper and more deep every minute before our aching eyes,\nbeneath the boiling inrush of the seas.\n\nBut though the great mass of the soldiery were dazed and maddened at the\nprospect of the overwhelming which threatened them, there were some with\na strength of mind too valiant to give any outward show of discomposure.\nPresently a compact little body of people came from out the houses and\nthe temples, and headed directly across the open ground towards the Ark.\nOn the outside marched Phorenice's personal guards with their weapons\nnew blooded. They had been forced to fight a way through their own\nfellow soldiers. The poor demented creatures had thought it was every\none for himself now, till these guards (by their mistress's order)\nproved to them that Phorenice still came first.\n\nAnd in the middle of them, borne in a litter of gold and ivory by her\ngrotesque European slaves, rode the Empress, still calm, still lovely,\nand seemingly divided in her sentiments between contempt and amusement.\nHer two children lay in the litter at her feet. On her right hand\nmarched Tatho gorgeously apparelled, and with a beard curled and plaited\ninto a thousand ringlets. On the other side, plying her industry with\nunruffled defence, walked Ylga, once again fan-girl, and so still second\nlady in this dwindling kingdom.\n\nThe party of them halted half a score of paces from the Ark by\nPhorenice's order. \"Do not go nearer to those unclean old men. They\ncarry a rank odour with them, and for the moment we are short of\nessences to sweeten the air of their neighbourhood.\" She lifted her\neyebrows and looked up at me. \"Truly a quiet little gathering of old\nacquaintances. Why, there is Deucalion, that once I took the flavour of\nand threw aside when he cloyed me.\"\n\n\"I have Nais here,\" I said, \"and presently we two will be all that are\nleft alive of this nation.\"\n\n\"Nais is quite welcome to my leavings,\" she laughed. \"I will look down\nupon your country cooings when presently I go back to the Place behind\nthe stars from which I came. You are a very rustic person, Deucalion.\nThey tell me too that three or four of these smelling old men up\nhere have named you King. Did you swell much with dignity? Or did\nyou remember that there was a pretty Empress left that would still be\nEmpress so long as there was an Atlantis to govern? Come, sir, find your\ntongue. By my face! you must have hungered for me very madly these years\nwe have been parted, if new-grown ruggedness of feature is an evidence.\"\n\n\"Have your gibe. I do not gibe back at a woman who presently will die.\"\n\n\"Bah! Deucalion, you will live behind the times. Have they not told you\nthat I know the Great Secret and am indeed a Goddess now? My arts can\nmake life run on eternally.\"\n\n\"Then the waters will presently test them hard,\" I said, but there the\ntalk was taken into other lips. Zaemon went forward to the front of\nthe litter with the Symbol of our Lord the Sun glowing in his hand, and\nburst into a flow of cursing. It was hard for me to hear his words. The\nroar of the waters which poured up over the land, and beat in vast waves\nagainst the Sacred Mountain itself, grew nearer and more loud. But the\nold man had his say.\n\nPhorenice gave orders to her guards for his killing; yes, tried even to\nrise from the litter and do the work herself; but Zaemon held the Symbol\nto his front, and its power in that supreme moment mastered all the arts\nthat could be brought against it. The majesty of the most High Gods\nwas vindicated, and that splendid Empress knew it and lay back sullenly\namongst the cushions of her litter, a beaten woman.\n\nOnly one person in that rigid knot of people found power to leave the\nrest, and that was Ylga. She came out to the side of the Ark, and leaned\nup, and cried me a farewell through the gathering roar of the flood.\n\n\"I would I might save you and take you with us,\" I said.\n\n\"As for that,\" she said, with a gesture, \"I would not come if you asked\nme. I am not a woman that will take anything less than all. But I shall\nmeet what comes presently with the memory that you will have me always\nsomewhere in your recollection. I know somewhat of men, even men of your\nstamp, Deucalion, and you will never forget that you came very near to\nloving me once.\"\n\nI think, too, she said something further, concerning Nais, but the\nbellowing rush of the waters drowned all other words. A great mist made\nfrom the stream sent up by the swamped burning mountains stopped all\naccurate view, though the blaze from the fires lit it like gold. But\nI had a last sight of a horde of soldiery rushing up the slopes of the\nMountain, with a scum of surge billowing at their heels, and licking\nmany of them back in its clutch. And then my eye fell on old Zaemon\nwaving to me with the Symbol to shut down the door in the roof of the\nArk.\n\nI obeyed his last command, and went down the stair, and closed all\ningress behind me. There were bolts placed ready, and I shot these into\ntheir sockets, and there were Nais and I alone, and cut off from all the\nrest of our world that remained.\n\nI went to the place where she lay, and put my arms tightly around her.\nWithout, we heard men beating desperately on the Ark with their weapons,\nand some even climbed by the battens to the top and wrenched to try and\nmove the door from its fastenings. The end was coming very nearly to\nthem now, and the great crowd of them were mad with terror.\n\nI would have given much to have known how Phorenice fared in that final\ntumult, and how she faced it. I could see her, with her lovely face, and\nher wondrous eyes, and her ruddy hair curling about her neck, and by\nall the Gods! I thought more of her at that last moment than of the\npoor land she had conquered, and misgoverned, and brought to this horrid\ndestruction. There is no denying the fascination which Phorenice carried\nwith her.\n\nBut the end did not dally long with its coming. There was a little surge\nthat lifted the Ark a hand's breadth or so in its cradle, and set it\nback again with a jar and a quiver. The blows from axes and weapons\nceased on its lower part, but redoubled into frenzied batterings on its\nrounded roof. There were some screams and cries also which came to\nus but dully through the thickness of its ponderous sheathing, though\nlikely enough they were sent forth at the full pitch of human lungs\noutside. And when another surge came, roaring and thundering, which\npicked up the great vessel as though it had been a feather, and spun it\ngiddily; and after that we touched earth or rock no more.\n\nWe tossed about on the crest and troughs of delirious seas, a sport for\nthe greedy Gods of the ocean. The lamp had fallen, and we crouched there\nin darkness, dully weighed with the burden of knowledge that we alone\nwere saved out of what was yesterday a mighty nation.\n\n\n\n\n20. ON THE BOSOM OF THE DEEP\n\n\nThe Ark was rudderless, oarless, and machineless, and could travel only\nwhere the High Gods chose. The inside was dark, and full of an ancient\nsmell, and crowded with groanings and noise. I could not find the\nfire-box to relight the fallen lamp, and so we had to endure blindly\nwhat was dealt out to us. The waves tossed us in merciless sport, and I\nclung on by the side of Nais, holding her to the bed. We did not speak\nmuch, but there was full companionship in our bereavement and our\nsilence.\n\nWhen Atlantis sank to form new ocean bed, she left great whirlpools and\nspoutings from her drowned fires as a fleeting legacy to the Gods of the\nSea. And then, I think (though in the black belly of the Ark we could\nnot see these things), a vast hurricane of wind must have come on next\nso as to leave no piece of the desolation incomplete. For seven nights\nand seven days did this dreadful turmoil continue, as counted for us\nafterwards by the reckoner of hours which hung within the Ark, and then\nthe howling of the wind departed, and only the roll of a long still\nswell remained. It was regular and it was oily, as I could tell by the\ndifference of the motion, and then for the first time I dared to go up\nthe stair, and open the door which stood in the roof of the Ark.\n\nThe sweet air came gushing down to freshen the foulness within, and as\nthe Ark rode dryly over the seas, I went below and brought up Nais to\ngain refreshment from the curing rays of our Lord the Sun. Duly the pair\nof us adored Him, and gave thanks for His great mercy in coming to light\nanother day, and then we laid ourselves down where we were to doze, and\ntake that easy rest which we so urgently needed.\n\nYet, though I was tired beyond words, for long enough sleep would not\nvisit me. Wearily I stared out over the oily sunlit waters. No blur\nof land met the eye. The ring of ocean was unbroken on every side, and\noverhead the vault of heaven remained unchanged. The bosom of the deep\nwas littered with the poor wreckage of Atlantis, to remind one, if there\nhad been a need, that what had come about was fact, and not some horrid\ndream. Trees, squared timber, a smashed and upturned boat of hides, and\nhere and there the rounded corpse of a man or beast shouldered over the\nswells, and kept convoy with our Ark as she drifted on in charge of the\nGods and the current.\n\nBut sleep came to me at last, and I dropped off into unconsciousness,\nholding the hand of Nais in mine, and when next I woke, I found her\nopen-eyed also and watching me tenderly. We were finely rested, both of\nus, and rest and strength bring one complacency. We were more ready\nnow to accept the station which the High Gods had made for us without\nrepining, and so we went below again into the belly of the Ark to eat\nand drink and maintain strength for the new life which lay before us.\n\nA wonderful vessel was this Ark, now we were able to see it at leisure\nand intimately. Although for the first time now in all its centuries\nof life it swam upon the waters, it showed no leak or suncrack. Inside,\neven its floor was bone dry. That it was built from some wood, one could\nsee by the grainings, but nowhere could one find suture or joint. The\nliving timbers had been put in place and then grown together by an\nart which we have lost to-day, but which the Ancients knew with much\nperfection; and afterwards some treatment, which is also a secret\nof those forgotten builders, had made the wood as hard as metal and\nimpervious to all attacks of the weather.\n\nIn the gloomy cave of its belly were stored many matters. At one end, in\ngreat tanks on either side of central alley, was a prodigious store of\ngrain. Sweet water was in other tanks at the other end. In another place\nwere drugs and samples, and essences of the life of beasts; all these\nthings being for use whilst the Ark roamed under the guidance of the\nGods on the bosom of the deep. On all the walls of the Ark, and on all\nthe partitions of the tanks and the other woodwork, there were carved\nin the rude art of bygone time representations of all the beasts which\nlived in Atlantis; and on these I looked with a hunter's interest, as\nsome of them were strange to me, and had died out with the men who had\nperpetuated them in these sculptures. There was a good store of weapons\ntoo and the tools for handicrafts.\n\nNow, for many weeks, our life endured in this Ark as the Gods drove it\nabout here and there across the face of the waters. We had no government\nover direction; we could not by so much as a hair's breadth a day\nincrease her speed. The High Gods that had chosen the two of us to be\nthe only ones saved out of all Atlantis, had sole control of our fate,\nand into Their hands we cheerfully resigned our future direction.\n\nOf that land which we reached in due time, and where we made our abiding\nplace, and where our children were born, I shall tell of in its place;\nbut since this chronicle has proceeded so far in an exact order of the\nevents as they came to pass, it is necessary first to narrate how we\ncame by the sheets on which it is written.\n\nIn a great coffer, in the centre of the Ark's floor, the whole of the\nMysteries learned during the study of ages were set down in accurate\nwriting. I read through some of them during the days which passed, and\nthe awfulness of the Powers over which they gave control appalled me. I\nhad seen some of these Powers set loose in Atlantis, and was a witness\nof her destruction. But here were Powers far higher than those; here was\nthe great Secret of Life and Death which Phorenice also had found, and\nfor which she had been destroyed; and there were other things also of\nwhich I cannot even bring my stylo to scribe.\n\nThe thought of being custodian of these writings was more than I could\nendure, and the more the matter rested in my mind, the more intolerable\nbecame the burden. And at last I took hot irons, and with them seared\nthe wax on the sheets till every letter of the old writings was\nobliterated. If I did wrong, the High Gods in Their infinite justice\nwill give me punishment; if it is well that these great secrets should\nendure on earth, They in their infinite power will dictate them afresh\nto some fitting scribes; but I destroyed them there as the Ark swayed\nwith us over the waves; and later, when we came to land, I rewrote upon\nthe sheets the matters which led to great Atlantis being dragged to her\ndeath-throes.\n\nNais, that I love so tenderly--\n\n[TRANSLATOR'S NOTE: The remaining sheets are too broken to be legible.]\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Lost Continent, by C.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
