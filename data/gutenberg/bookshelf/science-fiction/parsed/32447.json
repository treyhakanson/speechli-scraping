Therefore did they make men\n     to live always in the air and in the sunlight, and in the light of\n     the stars, that he would be reminded of them. And the Giants abode\n     yet a while, and taught men to speak, and to write, and to weave,\n     and to do many things which are needful to do, of which the\n     writings speak. And thereafter they departed to the far stars,\n     saying, Take this world as your own, and though we shall return,\n     fear not, for it is yours._\n\n     --THE BOOK OF LAWS\n\n\nHonath the Pursemaker was hauled from the nets an hour before the rest\nof the prisoners, as befitted his role as the arch-doubter of them all.\nIt was not yet dawn, but his captors led him in great bounds through the\nendless, musky-perfumed orchid gardens, small dark shapes with crooked\nlegs, hunched shoulders, slim hairless tails carried, like his, in\nconcentric spirals wound clockwise. Behind them sprang Honath on the end\nof a long tether, timing his leaps by theirs, since any slip would hang\nhim summarily.\n\nHe would of course be on his way to the surface, some 250 feet below the\norchid gardens, shortly after dawn in any event. But not even the\narch-doubter of them all wanted to begin the trip--not even at the\nmerciful snap-spine end of a tether--a moment before the law said, Go.\n\nThe looping, interwoven network of vines beneath them, each cable as\nthick through as a man's body, bellied out and down sharply as the\nleapers reached the edge of the fern-tree forest which surrounded the\ncopse of fan-palms. The whole party stopped before beginning the descent\nand looked eastward, across the dim bowl. The stars were paling more and\nmore rapidly; only the bright constellation of the Parrot could still be\npicked out without doubt.\n\n\"A fine day,\" one of the guards said, conversationally. \"Better to go\nbelow on a sunny day than in the rain, pursemaker.\"\n\nHonath shuddered and said nothing. Of course it was always raining down\nbelow in Hell, that much could be seen by a child. Even on sunny days,\nthe endless pinpoint rain of transpiration, from the hundred million\nleaves of the eternal trees, hazed the forest air and soaked the black\nbog forever.\n\nHe looked around in the brightening, misty morning. The eastern horizon\nwas black against the limb of the great red sun, which had already risen\nabout a third of its diameter; it was almost time for the small,\nblue-white, furiously hot consort to follow. All the way to that brink,\nas to every other horizon, the woven ocean of the treetops flowed gently\nin long, unbreaking waves, featureless as some smooth oil. Only nearby\ncould the eye break that ocean into its details, into the world as it\nwas: a great, many-tiered network, thickly overgrown with small ferns,\nwith air-drinking orchids, with a thousand varieties of fungi sprouting\nwherever vine crossed vine and collected a little humus for them, with\nthe vivid parasites sucking sap from the vines, the trees, and even each\nother. In the ponds of rain-water collected by the closely fitting\nleaves of the bromeliads tree-toads and peepers stopped down their\nhoarse songs dubiously as the light grew and fell silent one by one. In\nthe trees below the world, the tentative morning screeches of the\nlizard-birds--the souls of the damned, or the devils who hunted them, no\none was quite sure which--took up the concert.\n\nA small gust of wind whipped out of the hollow above the glade of\nfan-palms, making the network under the party shift slightly, as if in a\nloom. Honath gave with it easily, automatically, but one of the smaller\nvines toward which he had moved one furless hand hissed at him and went\npouring away into the darkness beneath--a chlorophyll-green snake, come\nup out of the dripping aerial pathways in which it hunted in ancestral\ngloom, to greet the suns and dry its scales in the quiet morning.\nFarther below, an astonished monkey, routed out of its bed by the\ndisgusted serpent, sprang into another tree, reeling off ten mortal\ninsults, one after the other, while still in mid-leap. The snake, of\ncourse, paid no attention, since it did not speak the language of men;\nbut the party on the edge of the glade of fan-palms snickered\nappreciatively.\n\n\"Bad language they favor below,\" another of the guards said. \"A fit\nplace for you and your blasphemers, pursemaker. Come now.\"\n\nThe tether at Honath's neck twitched, and then his captors were soaring\nin zig-zag bounds down into the hollow toward the Judgment Seat. He\nfollowed, since he had no choice, the tether threatening constantly to\nfoul his arms, legs or tail, and--worse, far worse--making his every\nmortifying movement ungraceful. Above, the Parrot's starry plumes\nflickered and faded into the general blue.\n\nToward the center of the saucer above the grove, the stitched\nleaf-and-leather houses clustered thickly, bound to the vines\nthemselves, or hanging from an occasional branch too high or too slender\nto bear the vines. Many of these purses Honath knew well, not only as\nvisitor but as artisan. The finest of them, the inverted flowers which\nopened automatically as the morning dew bathed them, yet which could be\nclosed tightly and safely around their occupants at dusk by a single\ndraw-string, were his own design as well as his own handiwork. They had\nbeen widely admired and imitated.\n\nThe reputation that they had given him, too, had helped to bring him to\nthe end of the snap-spine tether. They had given weight to his words\namong others--weight enough to make him, at last, the arch-doubter, the\nman who leads the young into blasphemy, the man who questions the Book\nof Laws.\n\nAnd they had probably helped to win him his passage on the Elevator to\nHell.\n\nThe purses were already opening as the party swung among them. Here and\nthere, sleepy faces blinked out from amid the exfoliating sections,\ncriss-crossed by relaxing lengths of dew-soaked rawhide. Some of the\nawakening householders recognized Honath, of that he was sure, but none\ncame out to follow the party--though the villagers should be beginning\nto drop from the hearts of their stitched flowers like ripe seed-pods by\nthis hour of any normal day.\n\nA Judgment was at hand, and they knew it--and even those who had slept\nthe night in one of Honath's finest houses would not speak for him now.\nEveryone knew, after all, that Honath did not believe in the Giants.\n\nHonath could see the Judgment Seat itself now, a slung chair of woven\ncane crowned along the back with a row of gigantic mottled orchids.\nThese had supposedly been transplanted there when the chair was made,\nbut no one could remember how old they were; since there were no\nseasons, there was no particular reason why they should not have been\nthere forever. The Seat itself was at the back of the arena and high\nabove it, but in the gathering light Honath could make out the\nwhite-furred face of the Tribal Spokesman, like a lone silver-and-black\npansy among the huge vivid blooms.\n\nAt the center of the arena proper was the Elevator itself. Honath had\nseen it often enough, and had himself witnessed Judgments where it was\ncalled into use, but he could still hardly believe that he was almost\nsurely to be its next passenger. It consisted of nothing more than a\nlarge basket, deep enough so that one would have to leap out of it, and\nrimmed with thorns to prevent one from leaping back in. Three hempen\nropes were tied to its rim, and were then cunningly interwound on a\nsingle-drum windlass of wood, which could be turned by two men even when\nthe basket was loaded.\n\nThe procedure was equally simple. The condemned man was forced into the\nbasket, and the basket lowered out of sight, until the slackening of the\nropes indicated that it had touched the surface. The victim climbed\nout--and if he did not, the basket remained below until he starved or\nuntil Hell otherwise took care of its own--and the windlass was rewound.\n\nThe sentences were for varying periods of time, according to the\nseverity of the crime, but in practical terms this formality was empty.\nAlthough the basket was dutifully lowered when the sentence had expired,\nno one had ever been known to get back into it. Of course, in a world\nwithout seasons or moons, and hence without any but an arbitrary year,\nlong periods of time are not easy to count accurately. The basket could\narrive thirty or forty days to one side or the other of the proper date.\nBut this was only a technicality, however, for if keeping time was\ndifficult in the attic world it was probably impossible in Hell.\n\nHonath's guards tied the free end of his tether to a branch and settled\ndown around him. One abstractedly passed a pine cone to him and he tried\nto occupy his mind with the business of picking the juicy seeds from it,\nbut somehow they had no flavor.\n\nMore captives were being brought in now, while the Spokesman watched\nwith glittering black eyes from his high perch. There was Mathild the\nForager, shivering as if with ague, the fur down her left side\nglistening and spiky, as though she had inadvertently overturned a tank\nplant on herself. After her was brought Alaskon the Navigator, a\nmiddle-aged man only a few years younger than Honath himself; he was\ntied up next to Honath, where he settled down at once, chewing at a\njoint of cane with apparent indifference.\n\nThus far, the gathering had proceeded without more than a few words\nbeing spoken, but that ended when the guards tried to bring Seth the\nNeedlesmith from the nets. He could be heard at once, over the entire\ndistance to the glade, alternately chattering and shrieking in a mixture\nof tones that might mean either fear or fury. Everyone in the glade but\nAlaskon turned to look, and heads emerged from purses like new\nbutterflies from cocoons.\n\nA moment later, Seth's guards came over the lip of the glade in a\ntangled group, now shouting themselves. Somewhere in the middle of the\nknot Seth's voice became still louder; obviously he was clinging with\nall five members to any vine or frond he could grasp, and was no sooner\npried loose from one than he would leap by main force, backwards if\npossible, to another. Nevertheless he was being brought inexorably down\ninto the arena, two feet forward, one foot back, three feet forward....\n\nHonath's guards resumed picking their pine-cones. During the\ndisturbance, Honath realized Charl the Reader had been brought in\nquietly from the same side of the glade. He now sat opposite Alaskon,\nlooking apathetically down at the vine-web, his shoulders hunched\nforward. He exuded despair; even to look at him made Honath feel a\nrenewed shudder.\n\nFrom the High Seat, the Spokesman said: \"Honath the Pursemaker, Alaskon\nthe Navigator, Charl the Reader, Seth the Needlesmith Mathild the\nForager, you are called to answer to justice.\"\n\n\"Justice!\" Seth shouted, springing free of his captors with a tremendous\nbound and bringing up with a jerk on the end of his tether. \"This is no\njustice! I have nothing to do with--\"\n\nThe guards caught up with him and clamped brown hands firmly over his\nmouth. The Spokesman watched with amused malice.\n\n\"The accusations are three,\" the Spokesman said. \"The first, the telling\nof lies to children. Second, the casting into doubt of the divine order\namong men. Third, the denial of the Book of Laws. Each of you may speak\nin order of age. Honath the Pursemaker, your plea may be heard.\"\n\nHonath stood up, trembling a little, but feeling a surprisingly renewed\nsurge of his old independence.\n\n\"Your charges,\" he said, \"all rest upon the denial of the Book of Laws.\nI have taught nothing else that is contrary to what we all believe, and\ncalled nothing else into doubt. And I deny the charge.\"\n\nThe Spokesman looked down at him with disbelief. \"Many men and women\nhave said that you do not believe in the Giants, pursemaker,\" he said.\n\"You will not win mercy by piling up more lies.\"\n\n\"I deny the charge,\" Honath insisted. \"I believe in the Book of Laws as\na whole, and I believe in the Giants. I have taught only that the Giants\nwere not real in the sense that we are real. I have taught that they\nwere intended as symbols of some higher reality and were not meant to be\ntaken as literal persons.\"\n\n\"What higher reality is this?\" the Spokesman demanded. \"Describe it.\"\n\n\"You ask me to do something the writers of the Book of Laws themselves\ncouldn't do,\" Honath said hotly. \"If they had to embody the reality in\nsymbols rather than writing it down directly, how could a mere\npursemaker do better?\"\n\n\"This doctrine is wind,\" the Spokesman said. \"And it is plainly intended\nto undercut authority and the order established by the Book. Tell me,\npursemaker: if men need not fear the Giants, why should they fear the\nlaw?\"\n\n\"Because they are men, and it is to their interest to fear the law. They\naren't children, who need some physical Giant sitting over them with a\nwhip to make them behave. Furthermore, Spokesman, this archaic belief\n_itself_ undermines us. As long as we believe that there are real\nGiants, and that some day they'll return and resume teaching us, so long\nwill we fail to seek answers to our questions for ourselves. Half of\nwhat we know was given to us in the Book, and the other half is supposed\nto drop to us from the skies if we wait long enough. In the meantime, we\nvegetate.\"\n\n\"If a part of the Book be untrue, there can be nothing to prevent that\nit is all untrue,\" the Spokesman said heavily. \"And we will lose even\nwhat you call the half of our knowledge--which is actually the whole of\nit--to those who see with clear eyes.\"\n\nSuddenly, Honath lost his temper. \"Lose it, then!\" he shouted. \"Let us\nunlearn everything we know only by rote, go back to the beginning, learn\nall over again, and _continue_ to learn, from our own experience.\nSpokesman, you are an old man, but there are still some of us who\nhaven't forgotten what curiosity means!\"\n\n\"Quiet!\" the Spokesman said. \"We have heard enough. We call on Alaskon\nthe Navigator.\"\n\n\"Much of the Book is clearly untrue,\" Alaskon said flatly, rising. \"As a\nhandbook of small trades it has served us well. As a guide to how the\nuniverse is made, it is nonsense, in my opinion; Honath is too kind to\nit. I've made no secret of what I think, and I still think it.\"\n\n\"And will pay for it,\" the Spokesman said, blinking slowly down at\nAlaskon. \"Charl the Reader.\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Charl said, without standing, or even looking up.\n\n\"You do not deny the charges?\"\n\n\"I've nothing to say,\" Charl said, but then, abruptly, his head jerked\nup, and he glared with desperate eyes at the Spokesman. \"I can read,\nSpokesman. I have seen words in the Book of Laws that contradict each\nother. I've pointed them out. They're facts, they exist on the pages.\nI've taught nothing, told no lies, preached no unbelief. I've pointed to\nthe facts. That's all.\"\n\n\"Seth the Needlesmith, you may speak now.\"\n\nThe guards took their hands gratefully off Seth's mouth; they had been\nbitten several times in the process of keeping him quiet up to now. Seth\nresumed shouting at once.\n\n\"I'm no part of this group! I'm the victim of gossip, envious neighbors,\nsmiths jealous of my skill and my custom! No man can say worse of me\nthan that I sold needles to this pursemaker--sold them in good faith!\nThe charges against me are lies, all lies!\"\n\nHonath jumped to his feet in fury, and then sat down again, choking back\nthe answering shout almost without tasting its bitterness. What did it\nmatter? Why should he bear witness against the young man? It would not\nhelp the others, and if Seth wanted to lie his way out of Hell, he might\nas well be given the chance.\n\nThe Spokesman was looking down at Seth with the identical expression of\noutraged disbelief which he had first bent upon Honath. \"Who was it cut\nthe blasphemies into the hardwood tree, by the house of Hosi the\nLawgiver?\" he demanded. \"Sharp needles were at work there, and there are\nwitnesses to say that your hands held them.\"\n\n\"More lies!\"\n\n\"Needles found in your house fit the furrows, Seth.\"\n\n\"They were not mine--or they were stolen! I demand to be freed!\"\n\n\"You will be freed,\" the Spokesman said coldly. There was no possible\ndoubt as to what he meant. Seth began to weep and to shout at the same\ntime. Hands closed over his mouth again. \"Mathild the Forager, your plea\nmay be heard.\"\n\nThe young woman stood up hesitantly. Her fur was nearly dry now, but she\nwas still shivering.\n\n\"Spokesman,\" she said, \"I saw the things which Charl the Reader showed\nme. I doubted, but what Honath said restored my belief. I see no harm in\nhis teachings. They remove doubt, instead of fostering it as you say\nthey do. I see no evil in them, and I don't understand why this is a\ncrime.\"\n\nHonath looked over to her with new admiration. The Spokesman sighed\nheavily.\n\n\"I am sorry for you,\" he said, \"but as Spokesman we cannot allow\nignorance of the law as a plea. We will be merciful to you all, however.\nRenounce your heresy, affirm your belief in the Book as it is written\nfrom bark to bark, and you shall be no more than cast out of the tribe.\"\n\n\"I renounce it!\" Seth cried. \"I never shared it! It's all blasphemy and\nevery word is a lie! I believe in the Book, all of it!\"\n\n\"You, needlesmith,\" the Spokesman said, \"have lied before this Judgment,\nand are probably lying now. You are not included in the dispensation.\"\n\n\"Snake-spotted caterpillar! May your--_ummulph_.\"\n\n\"Pursemaker, what is your answer?\"\n\n\"It is No,\" Honath said stonily. \"I've spoken the truth. The truth can't\nbe unsaid.\"\n\nThe Spokesman looked down at the rest of them. \"As for you three,\nconsider your answers carefully. To share the heresy means sharing the\nsentence. The penalty will not be lightened only because you did not\ninvent the heresy.\"\n\nThere was a long silence.\n\nHonath swallowed hard. The courage and the faith in that silence made\nhim feel smaller and more helpless than ever. He realized suddenly that\nthe other three would have kept that silence, even without Seth's\ndefection to stiffen their spines. He wondered if he could have done so.\n\n\"Then we pronounce the sentence,\" the Spokesman said. \"You are one and\nall condemned to one thousand days in Hell.\"\n\nThere was a concerted gasp from around the edges of the arena, where,\nwithout Honath's having noticed it before, a silent crowd had gathered.\nHe did not wonder at the sound. The sentence was the longest in the\nhistory of the tribe.\n\nNot that it really meant anything. No one had ever come back from as\nlittle as one hundred days in Hell. No one had ever come back from Hell\nat all.\n\n\"Unlash the Elevator. All shall go together.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe basket swayed. The last of the attic world that Honath saw was a\ncircle of faces, not too close to the gap in the vine web, peering down\nafter them. Then the basket fell another few yards to the next turn of\nthe windlass and the faces vanished.\n\nSeth was weeping in the bottom of the Elevator, curled up into a tight\nball, the end of his tail wrapped around his nose and eyes. No one else\ncould make a sound, least of Honath.\n\nThe gloom closed around them. It seemed extraordinarily still. The\noccasional harsh screams of a lizard-bird somehow distended the silence\nwithout breaking it. The light that filtered down into the long aisles\nbetween the trees seemed to be absorbed in a blue-green haze through\nwhich the lianas wove their long curved lines. The columns of\ntree-trunks, the pillars of the world, stood all around them, too\ndistant in the dim light to allow them to gauge their speed of descent.\nOnly the irregular plunges of the basket proved that it was even in\nmotion any longer, though it swayed laterally in a complex, overlapping\nseries of figure-eights.\n\nThen the basket lurched downward once more, brought up short, and tipped\nsidewise, tumbling them all against the hard cane. Mathild cried out in\na thin voice, and Seth uncurled almost instantly, clawing for a\nhandhold. Another lurch, and the Elevator lay down on its side and was\nstill.\n\nThey were in Hell.\n\nCautiously, Honath began to climb out, picking his way over the long\nthorns on the basket's rim. After a moment, Charl the Reader followed,\nand then Alaskon took Mathild firmly by the hand and led her out onto\nthe surface. The footing was wet and spongy, yet not at all resilient,\nand it felt cold; Honath's toes curled involuntarily.\n\n\"Come on, Seth,\" Charl said in a hushed voice. \"They won't haul it back\nup until we're all out. You know that.\"\n\nAlaskon looked around into the chilly mists. \"Yes,\" he said. \"And we'll\nneed a needlesmith down here. With good tools, there's just a chance--\"\n\nSeth's eyes had been darting back and forth from one to the other. With\na sudden chattering scream, he bounded out of the bottom of the basket,\nsoaring over their heads in a long, flat leap and struck the high knee\nat the base of the nearest tree, an immense fan palm. As he hit, his\nlegs doubled under him, and almost in the same motion he seemed to\nrocket straight up into the murky air.\n\nGaping, Honath looked up after him. The young needlesmith had timed his\ncourse to the split second. He was already darting up the rope from\nwhich the Elevator was suspended. He did not even bother to look back.\n\nAfter a moment, the basket tipped upright. The impact of Seth's weight\nhitting the rope evidently had been taken by the windlass team to mean\nthat the condemned people were all out on the surface; a twitch on the\nrope was the usual signal. The basket began to rise, hobbling and\ndancing. Its speed of ascent, added to Seth's took his racing, dwindling\nfigure out of sight quickly. After a while, the basket was gone, too.\n\n\"He'll never get to the top,\" Mathild whispered. \"It's too far, and he's\ngoing too fast. He'll lose strength and fall.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Alaskon said heavily. \"He's agile and strong. If\nanyone could make it, he could.\"\n\n\"They'll kill him if he does.\"\n\n\"Of course they will,\" Alaskon said, shrugging.\n\n\"I won't miss him,\" Honath said.\n\n\"No more will I. But we could use some sharp needles down here, Honath.\nNow we'll have to plan to make our own--if we can identify the different\nwoods, down here where there aren't any leaves to help us tell them\napart.\"\n\nHonath looked at the navigator curiously. Seth's bolt for the sky had\ndistracted him from the realization that the basket, too, was gone, but\nnow that desolate fact hit home. \"You actually plan to stay alive in\nHell, don't you, Alaskon?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Alaskon said calmly. \"This is no more Hell than--up\nthere--is Heaven. It's the surface of the planet, no more, no less. We\ncan stay alive if we don't panic. Were you just going to sit here until\nthe furies came for you, Honath?\"\n\n\"I hadn't thought much about it,\" Honath confessed. \"But if there is any\nchance that Seth will lose his grip on that rope--before he reaches the\ntop and they stab him--shouldn't we wait and see if we can catch him? He\ncan't weigh more than 35 pounds. Maybe we could contrive some sort of a\nnet--\"\n\n\"He'd just break our bones along with his,\" Charl said. \"I'm for getting\nout of here as fast as possible.\"\n\n\"What for? Do you know a better place?\"\n\n\"No, but whether this is Hell or not, there are demons down here. We've\nall seen them from up above. They must know that the Elevator always\nlands here and empties out free food. This must be a feeding-ground for\nthem--\"\n\nHe had not quite finished speaking when the branches began to sigh and\ntoss, far above. A gust of stinging droplets poured along the blue air\nand thunder rumbled. Mathild whimpered.\n\n\"It's only a squall coming up,\" Honath said. But the words came out in a\nseries of short croaks. As the wind had moved through the trees, Honath\nhad automatically flexed his knees and put his arms out for handholds,\nawaiting the long wave of response to pass through the ground beneath\nhim. But nothing happened. The surface under his feet remained stolidly\nwhere it was, flexing not a fraction of an inch in any direction. And\nthere was nothing nearby for his hands to grasp.\n\nHe staggered, trying to compensate for the failure of the ground to\nmove. At the same moment another gust of wind blew through the aisles, a\nlittle stronger than the first, and calling insistently for a new\nadjustment of his body to the waves which would be passing among the\ntreetops. Again the squashy surface beneath him refused to respond. The\nfamiliar give-and-take of the vine-web to the winds, a part of his world\nas accustomed as the winds themselves, was gone.\n\nHonath was forced to sit down, feeling distinctly ill. The damp, cool\nearth under his furless buttocks was unpleasant, but he could not have\nremained standing any longer without losing his meagre prisoner's\nbreakfast. One grappling hand caught hold of the ridged, gritting stems\nof a clump of horsetail, but the contact failed to allay the uneasiness.\n\nThe others seemed to be bearing it no better than Honath. Mathild in\nparticular was rocking dizzily, her lips compressed, her hands clasped\nto her delicate ears.\n\nDizziness. It was unheard of up above, except among those who had\nsuffered grave head injuries or were otherwise very ill. But on the\nmotionless ground of Hell, it was evidently going to be with them\nconstantly.\n\nCharl squatted, swallowing convulsively. \"I--I can't stand,\" he moaned.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" Alaskon said, though he had remained standing only by\nclinging to the huge, mud-colored bulb of a cycadella. \"It's just a\ndisturbance of our sense of balance. We'll get used to it.\"\n\n\"We'd better,\" Honath said, relinquishing his grip on the horsetails by\na sheer act of will. \"I think Charl's right about this being a\nfeeding-ground, Alaskon. I hear something moving around in the ferns.\nAnd if this rain lasts long, the water will rise here, too. I've seen\nsilver flashes from down here many a time after heavy rains.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Mathild said, her voice subdued. \"The base of the\nfan-palm grove always floods. That's why the treetops are lower there.\"\n\nThe wind seemed to have let up a little, though the rain was still\nfalling. Alaskon stood up tentatively and looked around.\n\n\"Then let's move on,\" he said. \"If we try to keep under cover until we\nget to higher ground--\"\n\nA faint crackling sound, high above his head, interrupted him. It got\nlouder. Feeling a sudden spasm of pure fear, Honath looked up.\n\nNothing could be seen for an instant but the far-away curtain of\nbranches and fern fronds. Then, with shocking suddenness, something\nplummeted through the blue-green roof and came tumbling toward them. It\nwas a man, twisting and tumbling through the air with grotesque\nslowness, like a child turning in its sleep. They scattered.\n\nThe body hit the ground with a sodden thump, but there were sharp\novertones to the sound, like the bursting of a gourd. For a moment\nnobody moved. Then Honath crept forward.\n\nIt had been Seth, as Honath had realized the moment the figurine had\nburst through the branches far above. But it had not been the fall that\nhad killed him. He had been run through by at least a dozen\nneedles--some of them, beyond doubt, tools from his own shop, their\npoints edged hair-fine by his own precious strops of leatherwood-bark.\n\nThere would be no reprieve from above. The sentence was one thousand\ndays. This burst and broken huddle of fur was the only alternative.\n\nAnd the first day had barely begun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey toiled all the rest of the day to reach higher ground. As they\nstole cautiously closer to the foothills of the Great Range and the\nground became firmer, they were able to take to the air for short\nstretches, but they were no sooner aloft among the willows than the\nlizard-birds came squalling down on them by the dozens, fighting among\neach other for the privilege of nipping these plump and incredibly\nslow-moving monkeys.\n\nNo man, no matter how confirmed a free-thinker, could have stood up\nunder such an onslaught by the creatures he had been taught as a child\nto think of as his ancestors. The first time it happened, every member\nof the party dropped like a pine-cone to the sandy ground and lay\nparalyzed under the nearest cover, until the brindle-feathered,\nfan-tailed screamers tired of flying in such tight circles and headed\nfor clearer air. Even after the lizard-birds had given up, they crouched\nquietly for a long time, waiting to see what greater demons might have\nbeen attracted by the commotion.\n\nLuckily, on the higher ground there was much more cover from low-growing\nshrubs and trees--palmetto, sassafras, several kinds of laurel,\nmagnolia, and a great many sedges. Up here, too, the endless jungle\nbegan to break around the bases of the great pink cliffs. Overhead were\nwelcome vistas of open sky, sketchily crossed by woven bridges leading\nfrom the vine-world to the cliffs themselves. In the intervening columns\nof blue air a whole hierarchy of flying creatures ranked themselves,\nlayer by layer. First, the low-flying beetles, bees and two-winged\ninsects. Next were the dragonflies which hunted them, some with\nwingspreads as wide as two feet. Then the lizard-birds, hunting the\ndragonflies and anything else that could he nipped without fighting\nback. And at last, far above, the great gliding reptiles coasting along\nthe brows of the cliffs, riding the rising currents of air, their\nlong-jawed hunger stalking anything that flew--as they sometimes stalked\nthe birds of the attic world, and the flying fish along the breast of\nthe distant sea.\n\nThe party halted in an especially thick clump of sedges. Though the rain\ncontinued to fall, harder than ever, they were all desperately thirsty.\nThey had yet to find a single bromelaid: evidently the tank-plants did\nnot grow in Hell. Cupping their hands to the weeping sky accumulated\nsurprisingly little water; and no puddles large enough to drink from\naccumulated on the sand. But at least, here under the open sky, there\nwas too much fierce struggle in the air to allow the lizard-birds to\ncongregate and squall about their hiding place.\n\nThe white sun had already set and the red sun's vast arc still bulged\nabove the horizon. In the lurid glow the rain looked like blood, and the\nseamed faces of the pink cliffs had all but vanished. Honath peered\ndubiously out from under the sedges at the still distant escarpments.\n\n\"I don't see how we can hope to climb those,\" he said, in a low voice.\n\"That kind of limestone crumbles as soon as you touch it, otherwise we'd\nhave had better luck with our war against the cliff tribe.\"\n\n\"We could go around the cliffs,\" Charl said. \"The foothills of the Great\nRange aren't very steep. If we could last until we get to them, we could\ngo on up into the Range itself.\"\n\n\"To the volcanoes!\" Mathild protested. \"But nothing can live up there,\nnothing but the white fire-things. And there are the lava-flows, too,\nand the choking smoke--\"\n\n\"Well, we can't climb these cliffs. Honath's quite right,\" Alaskon said.\n\"And we can't climb the Basalt Steppes, either--there's nothing to eat\nalong them, let alone any water or cover. I don't see what else we can\ndo but try to get up into the foothills.\"\n\n\"Can't we stay here?\" Mathild said plaintively.\n\n\"No,\" Honath said, even more gently than he had intended. Mathild's four\nwords were, he knew, the most dangerous words in Hell--he knew it quite\nsurely, because of the imprisoned creature inside him that cried out to\nsay \"Yes\" instead. \"We have to get out of the country of the demons. And\nmaybe--just maybe--if we can cross the Great Range, we can join a tribe\nthat hasn't heard about our being condemned to Hell. There are supposed\nto be tribes on the other side of the Range, but the cliff people would\nnever let our folk get through to them. That's on our side now.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Alaskon said, brightening a little. \"And from the top of\nthe Range, we could come _down_ into another tribe--instead of trying to\nclimb up into their village out of Hell. Honath, I think it might work.\"\n\n\"Then we'd better try to sleep right here and now,\" Charl said. \"It\nseems safe enough. If we're going to skirt the cliffs and climb those\nfoothills, we'll need all the strength we've got left.\"\n\nHonath was about to protest, but he was suddenly too tired to care. Why\nnot sleep it over? And if in the night they were found and taken--well,\nthat would at least put an end to the struggle.\n\nIt was a cheerless and bone-damp bed to sleep in, but there was no\nalternative. They curled up as best they could. Just before he was about\nto drop off at last, Honath heard Mathild whimpering to herself and, on\nimpulse, crawled over to her and began to smooth down her fur with his\ntongue. To his astonishment each separate, silky hair was loaded with\ndew. Long before the girl had curled herself more tightly and her\ncomplaints had dwindled into sleepy murmurs, Honath's thirst was\nassuaged. He reminded himself to mention the method in the morning.\n\nBut when the white sun finally came up, there was no time to think of\nthirst. Charl the Reader was gone. Something had plucked him from their\nhuddled midst as neatly as a fallen breadfruit--and had dropped his\ncleaned ivory skull just as negligently, some two hundred feet farther\non up the slope which led toward the pink cliffs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLate that afternoon, the three found the blue, turbulent stream flowing\nout of the foothills of the Great Range. Not even Alaskon knew quite\nwhat to make of it. It looked like water, but it flowed like the rivers\nof lava that crept downward from the volcanoes. Whatever else it could\nbe, obviously it wasn't water; water stood, it never flowed. It was\npossible to imagine a still body of water as big as this, but only in a\nmoment of fancy, an exaggeration derived from the known bodies of water\nin the tank-plants. But this much water in motion? It suggested pythons;\nit was probably poisonous. It did not occur to any of them to drink from\nit. They were afraid even to touch it, let alone cross it, for it was\nalmost surely as hot as the other kinds of lava-rivers. They followed\nits course cautiously into the foothills, their throats as dry and\ngritty as the hollow stems of horsetails.\n\nExcept for the thirst--which was in an inverted sense their friend,\ninsofar as it overrode the hunger--the climbing was not difficult. It\nwas only circuitous, because of the need to stay under cover, to\nreconnoiter every few yards, to choose the most sheltered course rather\nthan the most direct. By an unspoken consent, none of the three\nmentioned Charl, but their eyes were constantly darting from side to\nside, searching for a glimpse of the thing that had taken him.\n\nThat was perhaps the worst, the most terrifying part of the tragedy: not\nonce, since they had been in Hell, had they actually seen a demon--or\neven any animal as large as a man. The enormous, three-taloned footprint\nthey had found in the sand beside their previous night's bed--the spot\nwhere the thing had stood, looking down at the four sleepers from above,\ncoldly deciding which of them to seize--was the only evidence they had\nthat they were now really in the same world with the demons. The world\nof the demons they had sometimes looked down upon from the remote\nvine-webs.\n\nThe footprint--and the skull.\n\nBy nightfall, they had ascended perhaps a hundred and fifty feet. It was\ndifficult to judge distances in the twilight, and the token vine bridges\nfrom the attic world to the pink cliffs were now cut off from sight by\nthe intervening masses of the cliffs themselves. But there was no\npossibility that they could climb higher today. Although Mathild had\nborn the climb surprisingly well, and Honath himself still felt almost\nfresh, Alaskon was completely winded. He had taken a bad cut on one hip\nfrom a serrated spike of volcanic glass against which he had stumbled.\nThe wound, bound with leaves to prevent its leaving a spoor which might\nbe followed, evidently was becoming steadily more painful.\n\nHonath finally called a halt as soon as they reached the little ridge\nwith the cave in back of it. Helping Alaskon over the last boulders, he\nwas astonished to discover how hot the navigator's hands were. He took\nhim back into the cave and then came out onto the ledge again.\n\n\"He's really sick,\" he told Mathild in a low voice. \"He needs water, and\nanother dressing for that cut. And we've got to get both for him\nsomehow. If we ever get to the jungle on the other side of the Range,\nwe'll need a navigator even worse than we need a needlesmith.\"\n\n\"But how? I could dress the cut if I had the materials, Honath. But\nthere's no water up here. It's a desert; we'll never get across it.\"\n\n\"We've got to try. I can get him water, I think. There was a big\ncycladella on the slope we came up, just before we passed that obsidian\nspur that hurt Alaskon. Gourds that size usually have a fair amount of\nwater inside them and I can use a piece of the spur to rip it open--\"\n\nA small hand came out of the darkness and took him tightly by the elbow.\n\"Honath, you can't go back down there. Suppose the demon that--that took\nCharl is still following us? They hunt at night--and this country is all\nso strange....\"\n\n\"I can find my way. I'll follow the sound of the stream of blue lava or\nwhatever it is. You pull some fresh leaves for Alaskon and try to make\nhim comfortable. Better loosen those vines around the dressing a little.\nI'll be back.\"\n\nHe touched her hand and pried it loose gently. Then, without stopping to\nthink about it any further, he slipped off the ledge and edged toward\nthe sound of the stream, travelling crabwise on all fours.\n\nBut he was swiftly lost. The night was thick and completely\nimpenetrable, and he found that the noise of the stream seemed to come\nfrom all sides, providing him no guide at all. Furthermore, his memory\nof the ridge which led up to the cave appeared to be faulty, for he\ncould feel it turning sharply to the right beneath him, though he\nremembered distinctly that it had been straight past the first\nside-branch, and then had gone to the left. Or had he passed the first\nside-branch in the dark without seeing it? He probed the darkness\ncautiously with one hand.\n\nAt the same instant, a brisk, staccato gust of wind came whirling up out\nof the night across the ridge. Instinctively, Honath shifted his weight\nto take up the flexing of the ground beneath him.\n\nHe realized his error instantly and tried to arrest the complex set of\nmotions, but a habit-pattern so deeply ingrained could not be frustrated\ncompletely. Overwhelmed with vertigo, Honath grappled at the empty air\nwith hands, feet and tail and went toppling.\n\nAn instant later, with a familiar noise and an equally familiar cold\nshock that seemed to reach throughout his body, he was sitting in the\nmidst of--\n\nWater. Icy water. Water that rushed by him improbably with a menacing,\nmonkeylike chattering, but water all the same.\n\nIt was all he could do to repress a hoot of hysteria. He hunkered down\ninto the stream and soaked himself. Things nibbled delicately at his\ncalves as he bathed, but he had no reason to fear fish, small species of\nwhich often showed up in the tanks of the bromelaids. After lowering his\nmuzzle to the rushing, invisible surface and drinking his fill, he\ndunked himself completely and then clambered out onto the banks,\ncarefully neglecting to shake himself.\n\nGetting back to the ledge was much less difficult. \"Mathild?\" he called\nin a hoarse whisper. \"Mathild, we've got water.\"\n\n\"Come in here quick then. Alaskon's worse. I'm afraid, Honath.\"\n\nDripping, Honath felt his way into the cave. \"I don't have any\ncontainer. I just got myself wet--you'll have to sit him up and let him\nlick my fur.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure he can.\"\n\nBut Alaskon could, feebly, but sufficiently. Even the coldness of the\nwater--a totally new experience for a man who had never drunk anything\nbut the soup-warm contents of the bromelaids--seemed to help him. He lay\nback at last, and said in a weak but otherwise normal voice: \"So the\nstream was water after all.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Honath said. \"And there are fish in it, too.\"\n\n\"Don't talk,\" Mathild said. \"Rest, Alaskon.\"\n\n\"I'm resting. Honath, if we stick to the course of the stream.... Where\nwas I? Oh. We can follow the stream through the Range, now that we know\nit's water. How did you find that out?\"\n\n\"I lost my balance and fell into it.\"\n\nAlaskon chuckled. \"Hell's not so bad, is it?\" he said. Then he sighed,\nand rushes creaked under him.\n\n\"Mathild! What's the matter? Is he--did he die?\"\n\n\"No ... no. He's breathing. He's still sicker than he realizes, that's\nall.... Honath--if they'd known, up above, how much courage you have--\"\n\n\"I was scared white,\" Honath said grimly. \"I'm still scared.\"\n\nBut her hand touched his again in the solid blackness, and after he had\ntaken it, he felt irrationally cheerful. With Alaskon breathing so\nraggedly behind them, there was little chance that either of them would\nbe able to sleep that night; but they sat silently together on the hard\nstone in a kind of temporary peace. When the mouth of the cave began to\noutline itself with the first glow of the red sun, they looked at each\nother in a conspiracy of light all their own.\n\n_Let us unlearn everything we knew only by rote, go back to the\nbeginning, learn all over again, and continue to learn...._\n\nWith the first light of the white sun, a half-grown megatherium cub rose\nslowly from its crouch at the mouth of the cave and stretched\nluxuriously, showing a full set of saber-like teeth. It looked at them\nsteadily for a moment, its ears alert, then turned and loped away down\nthe slope.\n\nHow long it had been crouched there listening to them, it was impossible\nto know. They had been lucky that they had stumbled into the lair of a\nyoungster. A full-grown animal would have killed them all, within a few\nseconds after its cat's-eyes had collected enough dawn to identify them\npositively. The cub, since it had no family of its own, evidently had\nonly been puzzled to find its den occupied and didn't want to quarrel\nabout it.\n\nThe departure of the big cat left Honath frozen, not so much frightened\nas simply stunned by so unexpected an end to the vigil. At the first\nmoan from Alaskon, however, Mathild was up and walking softly to the\nnavigator, speaking in a low voice, sentences which made no particular\nsense and perhaps were not intended to. Honath stirred and followed her.\n\nHalfway back into the cave, his foot struck something and he looked\ndown. It was the thigh-bone of some medium-large animal, imperfectly\ncleaned and not very recent. It looked like a keepsake the megatherium\nhad hoped to save from the usurpers of its lair. Along a curved inner\nsurface there was a patch of thick grey mold. Honath squatted and peeled\nit off carefully.\n\n\"Mathild, we can put this over the wound,\" he said. \"Some molds help\nprevent wounds from festering.... How is he?\"\n\n\"Better, I think,\" Mathild murmured. \"But he's still feverish. I don't\nthink we'll be able to move on today.\"\n\nHonath was unsure whether to be pleased or disturbed. Certainly he was\nfar from anxious to leave the cave, where they seemed at least to be\nreasonably comfortable. Possibly they would also be reasonably safe, for\nthe low-roofed hole almost surely still smelt of megatherium, and\nintruders would recognize the smell--as the men from the attic world\ncould not--and keep their distance. They would have no way of knowing\nthat the cat had only been a cub and that it had vacated the premises,\nthough of course the odor would fade before long.\n\nYet it was important to move on, to cross the Great Range if possible,\nand in the end to wind their way back to the world where they belonged.\nAnd to win vindication, no matter how long it took. Even should it prove\nrelatively easy to survive in Hell--and there were few signs of that,\nthus far--the only proper course was to fight until the attic world was\ntotally regained. After all, it would have been the easy and the\ncomfortable thing, back there at the very beginning, to have kept one's\nincipient heresies to oneself and remained on comfortable terms with\none's neighbors. But Honath had spoken up, and so had the rest of them,\nin their fashions.\n\nIt was the ancient internal battle between what Honath wanted to do, and\nwhat he knew he ought to do. He had never heard of Kant and the\nCategorical Imperative, but he knew well enough which side of his nature\nwould win in the long run. But it had been a cruel joke of heredity\nwhich had fastened a sense of duty onto a lazy nature. It made even\nsmall decisions egregiously painful.\n\nBut for the moment at least, the decision was out of his hands. Alaskon\nwas too sick to be moved. In addition, the strong beams of sunlight\nwhich had been glaring in across the floor of the cave were dimming by\nthe instant, and there was a distant, premonitory growl of thunder.\n\n\"Then we'll stay here,\" he said. \"It's going to rain again, and hard\nthis time. Once it's falling in earnest, I can go out and pick us some\nfruit--it'll screen me even if anything is prowling around in it. And I\nwon't have to go as far as the stream for water, as long as the rain\nkeeps up.\"\n\nThe rain, as it turned out, kept up all day, in a growing downpour which\ncompletely curtained the mouth of the cave by early afternoon. The\nchattering of the nearby stream grew quickly to a roar.\n\nBy evening, Alaskon's fever seemed to have dropped almost to normal, and\nhis strength nearly returned as well. The wound, thanks more to the\nencrusted matte of mold than to any complications within the flesh\nitself, was still ugly-looking, but it was now painful only when the\nnavigator moved carelessly, and Mathild was convinced that it was\nmending. Alaskon himself, having been deprived of activity all day, was\nunusually talkative.\n\n\"Has it occurred to either of you,\" he said in the gathering gloom,\n\"that since that stream is water, it can't possibly be coming from the\nGreat Range? All the peaks over there are just cones of ashes and lava.\nWe've seen young volcanoes in the process of building themselves, so\nwe're sure of that. What's more, they're usually hot. I don't see how\nthere could possibly be any source of water in the Range--not even\nrun-off from the rains.\"\n\n\"It can't just come up out of the ground,\" Honath said. \"It must be fed\nby rain. By the way it sounds now, it could even be the first part of a\nflood.\"\n\n\"As you say, it's probably rain-water,\" Alaskon said cheerfully. \"But\nnot off the Great Range, that's out of the question. Most likely it\ncollects on the cliffs.\"\n\n\"I hope you're wrong,\" Honath said. \"The cliffs may be a little easier\nto climb from this side, but there's still the cliff tribe to think\nabout.\"\n\n\"Maybe, maybe. But the cliffs are big. The tribes on this side may never\nhave heard of the war with our tree-top folk. No, Honath, I think that's\nour only course.\"\n\n\"If it is,\" Honath said grimly, \"we're going to wish more than ever that\nwe had some stout, sharp needles among us.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlaskon's judgment was quickly borne out. The three left the cave at\ndawn the next morning, Alaskon moving somewhat stiffly but not otherwise\nnoticeably incommoded, and resumed following the stream bed upwards--a\nstream now swollen by the rains to a roaring rapids. After winding its\nway upwards for about a mile in the general direction of the Great\nRange, the stream turned on itself and climbed rapidly back toward the\nbasalt cliffs, falling toward the three over successively steeper\nshelves of jutting rock.\n\nThen it turned again, at right angles, and the three found themselves at\nthe exit of a dark gorge, little more than thirty feet high, but both\nnarrow and long. Here the stream was almost perfectly smooth, and the\nthin strip of land on each side of it was covered with low shrubs. They\npaused and looked dubiously into the canyon. It was singularly gloomy.\n\n\"There's plenty of cover, at least,\" Honath said in a low voice. \"But\nalmost anything could live in a place like that.\"\n\n\"Nothing very big could hide in it,\" Alaskon pointed out. \"It should be\nsafe. Anyhow it's the only way to go.\"\n\n\"All right. Let's go ahead, then. But keep your head down, and be ready\nto jump!\"\n\nHonath lost the other two by sight as soon as they crept into the dark\nshrubbery, but he could hear their cautious movements nearby. Nothing\nelse in the gorge seemed to move at all, not even the water, which\nflowed without a ripple over an invisible bed. There was not even any\nwind, for which Honath was grateful, although he had begun to develop an\nimmunity to the motionless ground beneath them.\n\nAfter a few moments, Honath heard a low whistle. Creeping sidewise\ntoward the source of the sound, he nearly bumped into Alaskon, who was\ncrouched beneath a thickly-spreading magnolia. An instant later,\nMathilda's face peered out of the dim greenery.\n\n\"Look,\" Alaskon whispered. \"What do you make of this?\"\n\n'This' was a hollow in the sandy soil, about four feet across and rimmed\nwith a low parapet of earth--evidently the same earth that had been\nscooped out of its center. Occupying most of it were three grey,\nellipsoidal objects, smooth and featureless.\n\n\"Eggs,\" Mathild said wonderingly.\n\n\"Obviously. But look at the size of them! Whatever laid them must be\ngigantic. I think we're trespassing in something's private valley.\"\n\nMathild drew in her breath. Honath thought fast, as much to prevent\npanic in himself as in the girl. A sharp-edged stone lying nearby\nprovided the answer. He seized it and struck.\n\nThe outer surface of the egg was leathery rather than brittle; it tore\nraggedly. Deliberately, Honath bent and put his mouth to the oozing\nsurface.\n\nIt was excellent. The flavor was decidedly stronger than that of birds'\neggs, but he was far too hungry to be squeamish. After a moment's\namazement, Alaskon and Mathild attacked the other two ovoids with a\nwill. It was the first really satisfying meal they had had in Hell. When\nthey finally moved away from the devastated nest, Honath felt better\nthan he had since the day he was arrested.\n\nAs they moved on down the gorge, they began again to hear the roar of\nwater, though the stream looked as placid as ever. Here, too, they saw\nthe first sign of active life in the valley: a flight of giant\ndragonflies skimming over the water. The insects took fright as soon as\nHonath showed himself, but quickly came back, their nearly non-existent\nbrains already convinced that there had always been men in the valley.\n\nThe roar got louder very rapidly. When the three rounded the long,\ngentle turn which had cut off their view from the exit, the source of\nthe roar came into view. It was a sheet of falling water as tall as the\ndepth of the gorge itself, which came arcing out from between two\npillars of basalt and fell to a roiling, frothing pool.\n\n\"This is as far as we go!\" Alaskon said, shouting to make himself heard\nover the tumult. \"We'll never be able to get up these walls!\"\n\nStunned, Honath looked from side to side. What Alaskon had said was all\ntoo obviously true. The gorge evidently had begun life as a layer of\nsoft, partly soluble stone in the cliffs, tilted upright by some\nvolcanic upheaval, and then worn completely away by the rushing stream.\nBoth cliff faces were of the harder rock, and were sheer and as smooth\nas if they had been polished by hand. Here and there a network of tough\nvines had begun to climb them, but nowhere did such a network even come\nclose to reaching the top.\n\nHonath turned and looked once more at the great arc of water and spray.\nIf there were only some way to prevent their being forced to retrace\ntheir steps--\n\nAbruptly, over the riot of the falls, there was a piercing, hissing\nshriek. Echoes picked it up and sounded it again and again, all the way\nup the battlements of the cliffs. Honath sprang straight up in the air\nand came down trembling, facing away from the pool.\n\nAt first he could see nothing. Then, down at the open end of the turn,\nthere was a huge flurry of motion.\n\nA second later, a two-legged, blue-green reptile half as tall as the\ngorge itself came around the turn in a single bound and lunged violently\ninto the far wall of the valley. It stopped as if momentarily stunned,\nand the great grinning head turned toward them a face of sinister and\nfurious idiocy.\n\n[Illustration] [2]\n\nThe shriek set the air to boiling again. Balancing itself with its heavy\ntail, the beast lowered its head and looked redly toward the falls.\n\nThe owner of the robbed nest had come home. They had met a demon of Hell\nat last.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHonath's mind at that instant went as white and blank as the under-bark\nof a poplar. He acted without thinking, without even knowing what he\ndid. When thought began to creep back into his head again, the three of\nthem were standing shivering in semidarkness, watching the blurred\nshadow of the demon lurching back and forth upon the screen of shining\nwater.\n\nIt had been nothing but luck, not foreplanning, to find that there was a\nconsiderable space between the back of the falls proper and the blind\nwall of the canyon. It had been luck, too, which had forced Honath to\nskirt the pool in order to reach the falls at all, and thus had taken\nthem all behind the silver curtain at the point where the weight of the\nfalling water was too low to hammer them down for good. And it had been\nthe blindest stroke of all that the demon had charged after them\ndirectly into the pool, where the deep, boiling water had slowed its\nthrashing hind legs enough to halt it before it went under the falls, as\nit had earlier blundered into the hard wall of the gorge.\n\nNot an iota of all this had been in Honath's mind before he had\ndiscovered it to be true. At the moment that the huge reptile had\nscreamed for the second time, he had simply grasped Mathild's hand and\nbroken for the falls, leaping from low tree to shrub to fern faster than\nhe had ever leapt before. He did not stop to see how well Mathild was\nkeeping up with him, or whether or not Alaskon was following. He only\nran. He might have screamed, too; he could not remember.\n\nThey stood now, all three of them, wet through, behind the curtain until\nthe shadow of the demon faded and vanished. Finally Honath felt a hand\nthumping his shoulder, and turned slowly.\n\nSpeech was impossible here, but Alaskon's pointing finger was eloquent\nenough. Along the back wall of the falls, where centuries of erosion had\nfailed to wear away completely the original soft limestone, there was a\nsort of serrated chimney, open toward the gorge, which looked as though\nit could be climbed. At the top of the falls, the water shot out from\nbetween the basalt pillars in a smooth, almost solid-looking tube,\narching at least six feet before beginning to break into the fan of\nspray and rainbows which poured down into the gorge. Once the chimney\nhad been climbed, it should be possible to climb out from under the\nfalls without passing through the water again.\n\nAnd after that--?\n\nAbruptly, Honath grinned. He felt weak all through with reaction, and\nthe face of the demon would probably be grinning in his dreams for a\nlong time to come. But at the same time he could not repress a surge of\nirrational confidence. He gestured upward jauntily, shook himself, and\nloped forward into the throat of the chimney.\n\nHardly more than an hour later they were all standing on a ledge\noverlooking the gorge, with the waterfall creaming over the brink next\nto them, only a few yards away. From here, it was evident that the gorge\nitself was only the bottom of a far greater cleft, a split in the\npink-and-grey cliffs as sharp as though it had been riven in the rock by\na bolt of sheet lightning. Beyond the basalt pillars from which the fall\nissued, however, the stream foamed over a long ladder of rock shelves\nwhich seemed to lead straight up into the sky.\n\n\"That way?\" Mathild said.\n\n\"Yes, and as fast as possible,\" Alaskon said, shading his eyes. \"It must\nbe late. I don't think the light will last much longer.\"\n\n\"We'll have to go single file,\" Honath added. \"And we'd better keep hold\nof each other's hands. One slip on those wet steps and--it's a long way\ndown again.\"\n\nMathild shuddered and took Honath's hand convulsively. To his\nastonishment, the next instant she was tugging him toward the basalt\npillars.\n\nThe irregular patch of deepening violet sky grew slowly as they climbed.\nThey paused often, clinging to the jagged escarpments until their breath\ncame back, and snatching icy water in cupped palms from the stream that\nfell down the ladder beside them. There was no way to tell how far up\ninto the dusk the way had taken them, but Honath suspected that they\nwere already somewhat above the level of their own vine-web world. The\nair smelled colder and sharper than it ever had above the jungle.\n\nThe final cut in the cliffs through which the stream fell was another\nchimney. It was steeper and more smooth-walled than the one which had\ntaken them out of the gorge under the waterfall, but narrow enough to be\nclimbed by bracing one's back against one side, and one's hands and feet\nagainst the other. The column of air inside the chimney was filled with\nspray, but in Hell that was too minor a discomfort to bother about.\n\nAt long last Honath heaved himself over the edge of the chimney onto\nflat rock, drenched and exhausted, but filled with an elation he could\nnot suppress and did not want to. They were above the attic jungle; they\nhad beaten Hell itself. He looked around to make sure that Mathild was\nsafe, and then reached a hand down to Alaskon. The navigator's bad leg\nhad been giving him trouble. Honath heaved mightily and Alaskon came\nheavily over the edge and lit sprawling on the high mesa.\n\nThe stars were out. For a while they simply sat and gasped for breath.\nThen they turned, one by one, to see where they were.\n\nThere was not a great deal to see. There was the mesa, domed with stars\non all sides and a shining, finned spindle, like a gigantic minnow,\npointing skyward in the center of the rocky plateau. And around the\nspindle, indistinct in the starlight....\n\n... Around the shining minnow, tending it, were Giants.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis, then, was the end of the battle to do what was right, whatever the\nodds. All the show of courage against superstition, all the black\nbattles against Hell itself, came down to this: _The Giants were real!_\n\nThey were unarguably real. Though they were twice as tall as men, stood\nstraighter, had broader shoulders, were heavier across the seat and had\nno visible tails, their fellowship with men was clear. Even their\nvoices, as they shouted to each other around their towering metal\nminnow, were the voices of men made into gods, voices as remote from\nthose of men as the voices of men were remote from those of monkeys, yet\njust as clearly of the same family.\n\nThese were the Giants of the Book of Laws. They were not only real, but\nthey had come back to Tellura as they had promised to do.\n\nAnd they would know what to do with unbelievers, and with fugitives from\nHell. It had all been for nothing--not only the physical struggle, but\nthe fight to be allowed to think for oneself as well. The gods existed,\nliterally, actually. This belief was the real hell from which Honath had\nbeen trying to fight free all his life--but now it was no longer just a\nbelief. It was a fact, a fact that he was seeing with his own eyes.\n\nThe Giants had returned to judge their handiwork. And the first of the\npeople they would meet would be three outcasts, three condemned and\ndegraded criminals, three jail-breakers--the worst possible detritus of\nthe attic world.\n\nAll this went searing through Honath's mind in less than a second, but\nnevertheless Alaskon's mind evidently had worked still faster. Always\nthe most outspoken unbeliever of the entire little group of rebels, the\none among them whose whole world was founded upon the existence of\nrational explanations for everything, his was the point of view most\ncompletely challenged by the sight before them now. With a deep, sharply\nindrawn breath, he turned abruptly and walked away from them.\n\nMathild uttered a cry of protest, which she choked off in the middle;\nbut it was already too late. A round eye on the great silver minnow came\nalight, bathing them all in an oval patch of brilliance.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHonath darted after the navigator. Without looking back, Alaskon\nsuddenly was running. For an instant longer Honath saw his figure,\npoised delicately against the black sky. Then he dropped silently out of\nsight, as suddenly and completely as if he had never been.\n\nAlaskon had borne every hardship and every terror of the ascent from\nHell with courage and even with cheerfulness but he had been unable to\nface being told that it had all been meaningless.\n\nSick at heart, Honath turned back, shielding his eyes from the\nmiraculous light. There was a clear call in some unknown language from\nnear the spindle.\n\nThen there were footsteps, several pairs of them, coming closer.\n\nIt was time for the Second Judgment.\n\nAfter a long moment, a big voice from the darkness said: \"Don't be\nafraid. We mean you no harm. We're men, just as you are.\"\n\nThe language had the archaic flavor of the Book of Laws, but it was\notherwise perfectly understandable. A second voice said: \"What are you\ncalled?\"\n\nHonath's tongue seemed to be stuck to the roof of his mouth. While he\nwas struggling with it, Mathild's voice came clearly from beside him:\n\n\"He is Honath the Pursemaker, and I am Mathild the Forager.\"\n\n\"You are a long distance from the place we left your people,\" the first\nGiant said. \"Don't you still live in the vine-webs above the jungles?\"\n\n\"Lord--\"\n\n\"My name is Jarl Eleven. This man is Gerhardt Adler.\"\n\nThis seemed to stop Mathild completely. Honath could understand why. The\nvery notion of addressing Giants by name was nearly paralyzing. But\nsince they were already as good as cast down into Hell again, nothing\ncould be lost by it.\n\n\"Jarl Eleven,\" he said, \"the people still live among the vines. The\nfloor of the jungle is forbidden. Only criminals are sent there. We are\ncriminals.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Jarl Eleven said. \"And you've come all the way from the surface to\nthis mesa? Gerhardt, this is prodigious. You have no idea what the\nsurface of this planet is like--it's a place where evolution has never\nmanaged to leave the tooth-and-nail stage. Dinosaurs from every period\nof the Mesozoic, primitive mammals all the way up the scale to the\nancient cats the works. That's why the original seeding team put these\npeople in the treetops instead.\"\n\n\"Honath, what was your crime?\" Gerhardt Adler said.\n\nHonath was almost relieved to have the questioning come so quickly to\nthis point. Jarl Eleven's aside, with its many terms he could not\nunderstand, had been frightening in its very meaninglessness.\n\n\"There were five of us,\" Honath said in a low voice. \"We said we--that\nwe did not believe in the Giants.\"\n\nThere was a brief silence. Then, shockingly, both Jarl Eleven and\nGerhardt Adler burst into enormous laughter.\n\nMathild cowered, her hands over her ears. Even Honath flinched and took\na step backward. Instantly, the laughter stopped, and the Giant called\nJarl Eleven stepped into the oval of light and sat down beside them. In\nthe light, it could be seen that his face and hands were hairless,\nalthough there was hair on his crown; the rest of his body was covered\nby a kind of cloth. Seated, he was no taller than Honath, and did not\nseem quite so fearsome.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said. \"It was unkind of us to laugh, but what\nyou said was highly unexpected. Gerhardt, come over here and squat down,\nso that you don't look so much like a statue of some general. Tell me,\nHonath, in what way did you not believe in the Giants?\"\n\nHonath could hardly believe his ears. A Giant had begged his pardon! Was\nthis still some joke even more cruel? But whatever the reason, Jarl\nEleven had asked him a question.\n\n\"Each of the five of us differed,\" he said. \"I held that you were\nnot--not real except as symbols of some abstract truth. One of us, the\nwisest, believed that you did not exist in any sense at all. But we all\nagreed that you were not gods.\"\n\n\"And of course we aren't,\" Jarl Eleven said. \"We're men. We come from\nthe same stock as you. We're not your rulers, but your brothers. Do you\nunderstand what I say?\"\n\n\"No,\" Honath admitted.\n\n\"Then let me tell you about it. There are men on many worlds, Honath.\nThey differ from one another, because the worlds differ, and different\nkinds of men are needed to people each one. Gerhardt and I are the kind\nof men who live on a world called Earth, and many other worlds like it.\nWe are two very minor members of a huge project called a 'seeding\nprogram', which has been going on for thousands of years now. It's the\njob of the seeding program to survey newly discovered worlds, and then\nto make men suitable to live on each new world.\"\n\n\"To make men? But only gods--\"\n\n\"No, no. Be patient and listen,\" said Jarl Eleven. \"We don't make men.\nWe make them suitable. There's a great deal of difference between the\ntwo. We take the living germ plasm, the sperm and the egg, and we modify\nit. When the modified man emerges, we help him to settle down in his new\nworld. That's what we did on Tellura--it happened long ago, before\nGerhardt and I were even born. Now we've come back to see how you people\nare getting along, and to lend a hand if necessary.\"\n\nHe looked from Honath to Mathild, and back again. \"Do you understand?\"\nhe said.\n\n\"I'm trying.\" Honath said. \"But you should go down to the jungle-top,\nthen. We're not like the others; they are the people you want to see.\"\n\n\"We shall, in the morning. We just landed here. But, just because you're\nnot like the others, we're more interested in you now. Tell me, has any\ncondemned man ever escaped from the jungle floor before you people?\"\n\n\"No, never. That's not surprising. There are monsters down there.\"\n\nJarl Eleven looked sidewise at the other Giant. He seemed to be smiling.\n\"When you see the films,\" he remarked, \"you'll call that the\nunderstatement of the century. Honath, how did you three manage to\nescape, then?\"\n\nHaltingly at first, and then with more confidence as the memories came\ncrowding vividly back, Honath told him. When he mentioned the feast at\nthe demon's nest, Jarl Eleven again looked significantly at Adler, but\nhe did not interrupt.\n\n\"And finally we got to the top of the chimney and came out on this flat\nspace,\" Honath said. \"Alaskon was still with us then, but when he saw\nyou and the metal thing he threw himself back down the cleft. He was a\ncriminal like us, but he should not have died. He was a brave man, and a\nwise one.\"\n\n\"Not wise enough to wait until all the evidence was in,\" Adler said\nenigmatically. \"All in all, Jarl, I'd say 'prodigious' is the word for\nit. This is easily the most successful seeding job any team has ever\ndone, at least in this limb of the galaxy. And what a stroke of luck, to\nbe on the spot just as it came to term, and with a couple at that!\"\n\n\"What does he mean?\" Honath said.\n\n\"Just this, Honath. When the seeding team set your people up in business\non Tellura, they didn't mean for you to live forever in the treetops.\nThey knew that, sooner or later, you'd have to come down to the ground\nand learn to fight this planet on its own terms. Otherwise, you'd go\nstale and die out.\"\n\n\"Live on the ground all the time?\" Mathild said in a faint voice.\n\n\"Yes, Mathild. The life in the treetops was to have been only an interim\nperiod, while you gathered knowledge you needed about Tellura and put it\nto use. But to be the real masters of the world, you will have to\nconquer the surface, too.\n\n\"The device your people worked out, that of sending criminals to the\nsurface, was the best way of conquering the planet that they could have\npicked. It takes a strong will and courage to go against custom, and\nboth those qualities are needed to lick Tellura. Your people exiled just\nsuch fighting spirits to the surface, year after year after year.\n\n\"Sooner or later, some of those exiles were going to discover how to\nlive successfully on the ground and make it possible for the rest of\nyour people to leave the trees. You and Honath have done just that.\"\n\n\"Observe please, Jarl,\" Adler said. \"The crime in this first successful\ncase was ideological. That was the crucial turn in the criminal policy\nof these people. A spirit of revolt is not quite enough, but couple it\nwith brains and--_ecce homo_!\"\n\nHonath's head was swimming. \"But what does all this mean?\" he said. \"Are\nwe--not condemned to Hell any more?\"\n\n\"No, you're still condemned, if you still want to call it that,\" Jarl\nEleven said soberly. \"You've learned how to live down there, and you've\nfound out something even more valuable: how to stay alive while cutting\ndown your enemies. Do you know that you killed three demons with your\nbare hands, you and Mathild and Alaskon?\"\n\n\"Killed--\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Jarl Eleven said. \"You ate three eggs. That is the\nclassical way, and indeed the only way, to wipe out monsters like the\ndinosaurs. You can't kill the adults with anything short of an anti-tank\ngun, but they're helpless in embryo--and the adults haven't the sense to\nguard their nests.\"\n\nHonath heard, but only distantly. Even his awareness of Mathild's warmth\nnext to him did not seem to help much.\n\n\"Then we have to go back down there,\" he said dully. \"And this time\nforever.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Jarl Eleven said, his voice gentle. \"But you wont be alone,\nHonath. Beginning tomorrow, you'll have all your people with you.\"\n\n\"_All_ our people? But you're going to drive them out?\"\n\n\"All of them. Oh, we won't prohibit the use of the vine-webs too, but\nfrom now on your race will have to fight it out on the surface as well.\nYou and Mathild have proven that it can be done. It's high time the rest\nof you learned, too.\"\n\n\"Jarl, you think too little of these young people themselves,\" Adler\nsaid. \"Tell them what is in store for them. They are frightened.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course. It's obvious. Honath, you and Mathild are the\nonly living individuals of your race who know how to survive down there\non the surface. And we're not going to tell your people how to do that.\nWe aren't even going to drop them so much as a hint. That part of it is\nup to you.\"\n\nHonath's jaw dropped.\n\n\"It's up to you,\" Jarl Eleven repeated firmly. \"We'll return you to your\ntribe tomorrow, and we'll tell your people that you two know the rules\nfor successful life on the ground--and that everyone else has to go down\nand live there too. We'll tell them nothing else but that. What do you\nthink they'll do then?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Honath said dazedly. \"Anything could happen. They might\neven make us Spokesman and Spokeswoman--except that we're just common\ncriminals.\"\n\n\"Uncommon pioneers, Honath. The man and the woman to lead the humanity\nof Tellura out of the attic, into the wide world.\" Jarl Eleven got to\nhis feet, the great light playing over him. Looking up after him, Honath\nsaw that there were at least a dozen other Giants standing just outside\nthe oval of light, listening intently to every word.\n\n\"But there's a little time to be passed before we begin,\" Jarl Eleven\nsaid. \"Perhaps you two would like to look over our ship.\"\n\nHumbly, but with a soundless emotion much like music inside him, Honath\ntook Mathild's hand. Together they walked away from the chimney to Hell,\nfollowing the footsteps of the Giants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Thing in the Attic, by James Benjamin Blish\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE THING IN THE ATTIC ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32447.txt or 32447.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/4/4/32447/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
