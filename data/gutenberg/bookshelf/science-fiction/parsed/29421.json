We had been following it since dawn and it was now\nclose to sunset. Where was it leading us? Should we go on or turn\nback? How much longer would our gas and oil hold out? And just where\nwere we? I turned and saw my questions reflected in the eyes of my\ncompanions, Paul Foulet of the French Suret\u00e9 and Douglas Brice of\nScotland Yard.\n\n\"Too fast!\" shouted Brice above the roar of our motors. I nodded. His\ngesture explained his meaning. The plane ahead had suddenly taken on a\nterrific, unbelievable speed. All day it had traveled normally,\nmaintaining, but not increasing, the distance between us. But in the\nlast fifteen minutes it had leaped into space. Fifteen minutes before\nit had been two miles in the lead; now it was barely visible. A tiny,\nvanishing speck. What could account for this burst of superhuman\nspeed? Who was in that plane? _What_ was in that plane?\n\nI glanced at Foulet. He shrugged non-committally, waving a courteous\nhand toward Brice. I understood; I agreed with him. This was Brice's\nparty, and the decision was up to him. Foulet and I just happened to\nbe along; it was partly design and partly coincidence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo days before I had been in Constantinople. I was disheartened and\nutterly disgusted. All the way from the home office of the United\nStates Secret Service in Washington I had trailed my man, only to lose\nhim. On steamships, by railway, airplane and motor we had\ntraveled--always with my quarry just one tantalizing jump ahead of\nme--and in Constantinople I had lost him. And it was a ruse a child\nshould have seen through. I could have beaten my head against a wall.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, I had run into Foulet. Not ten days before I had\ntalked to him in his office in Paris. I had told him a little of my\nerrand, for I was working on the hunch that this man I was after\nconcerned not only the United States, but France and the Continent as\nwell. And what Foulet told me served only to strengthen my conviction.\nSo, meeting him in Constantinople was a thin ray of light in my\ndisgusted darkness. At least I could explode to a kindred spirit.\n\n\"Lost your man!\" was his greeting. And it wasn't a question; it was a\nstatement.\n\n\"How did you know?\" I growled. My humiliation was too fresh to stand\nkidding.\n\n\"Constantinople,\" said Foulet amiably. \"You always lose them in\nConstantinople. I've lost three here.\"\n\n\"Three?\" I said, \"Like mine!\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" he nodded. Then he lowered his voice. \"Come to my hotel. We\ncan talk there.\"\n\n\"Now,\" he continued fifteen minutes later as we settled ourselves in\nhis room, \"you were very circumspect in Paris. You told me\nlittle--just a hint here and there. But it was enough. You--the United\nStates--have joined our ranks--\"\n\n\"You mean--\"\n\n\"I mean that for a year we, the various secret service organizations\nof the Continent--and that includes, of course, Scotland Yard--have\nbeen after--Well, to be frank, we don't know what we're after. But we\ndo know this. There is a power--there is someone, somewhere, who is\ntrying to conquer the world.\"\n\n[Illustration: _A white speck took shape beneath the rising Island._]\n\n\"Are you serious?\" I glanced at him but the tight lines of his set\nmouth convinced me. \"I beg your pardon,\" I murmured. \"Go ahead.\"\n\n\"I don't blame you for thinking it was a jest,\" he said imperturbably,\n\"But, to prove I know what I'm talking about, let me tell you what\nthis man has done whom you have been pursuing. He has done one of two\nthings. Either he has proved himself a dangerous revolutionary or he\nhas engineered the failure of a bank or chain of banks--\"\n\n\"We can't prove it,\" I interrupted.\n\n\"No,\" said Foulet, \"Neither can we. Neither can Scotland Yard--or the\nsecret services of Belgium or Germany or Italy or Spain. But there you\nare--\"\n\n\"You mean that in all these countries--?\"\n\n\"I mean that for a year--probably longer--these countries have been\nand are being steadily, and systematically, undermined. The morale of\nthe people is being weakened; their faith in their government is being\nbetrayed--and someone is behind it. Someone who can think faster and\nplan more carefully than we--someone whose agents we always lose in\nConstantinople! I'll wager you lost your man from a roof-top.\"\n\nI nodded, my disgust at my own stupidity returning in full force.\n\"There was a lower roof and a maze of crisscross alleys,\" I muttered.\n\"He got away.\"\n\n\"Was there an airplane anywhere around?\" asked Foulet.\n\nI glanced at him in surprise. What good would an airplane have been on\na roof-top ten feet wide by twelve feet long? Then I remembered.\n\"There was an airplane,\" I said, \"but it was a long way off, and I\ncould scarcely see it; but the air was very still and I heard the\nmotor.\"\n\nFoulet nodded, \"And if you had had a pair of glasses,\" he said gently,\n\"You would have seen that the airplane had a glider attached to it.\nThere is always an airplane--and a glider--when we lose our men from\nthe roofs of Constantinople.\"\n\n\"But that must be coincidence!\" I insisted. \"Why, I was on that roof\nright on the fellow's heels--and the airplane was at least five miles\naway!\"\n\nFoulet shrugged, \"Coincidence--possibly,\" he said, \"but it is our only\nclue.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I murmured thoughtfully, \"you have never been able to\nfollow--\"\n\nFoulet smiled, \"Can you imagine where that airplane would be by the\ntime we climbed down off our roofs and got to a flying field and\nstarted in pursuit?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe descended for dinner. Foulet's story had restored my\nself-confidence somewhat--but I was still sore. Of course Foulet\nconnecting my vanishing man with that disappearing airplane was\nabsurd--but where had the man gone? Was my supposition that he had\njumped to a lower roof, climbed a wall and run through the maze of\nalleyways in half a minute in any way less absurd?\n\nWe were halfway through dinner when Brice appeared. Brice was one of\nthe best men in Scotland Yard and I had known him many years. So,\nevidently, had Foulet, for his eyes flickered faintly with pleased\nsurprise at the sight of him. Brice came directly to our table. He was\nbursting with victorious joy. I could feel it somehow, although his\nface, carefully schooled to betray no emotion, was placid and casual.\n\nAll through the remainder of the meal I could feel the vibrations of\nhis excitement. But it was only at the very end that he confided\nanything--and his confidence only served to make the excitement and\nsense of impending thrill greater.\n\nJust as he was rising to leave he shoved a tiny strip of paper across\nthe table to me with a sidelong glance at Foulet. \"Another roof-top,\"\nI read scrawled in pencil. \"If you like, meet me at the flying field\nbefore dawn.\" If I liked! I shoved the paper across to Foulet who read\nit and carelessly twisted it into a spill to light his cigar. But his\nhand shook ever so slightly.\n\nNeedless to say we went to the flying field shortly after midnight.\nBruce was there, pacing up and down restlessly. Near him was a huge\ntri-motored biplane, its motor humming in readiness.\n\n\"I've put a man on the trail in my place,\" Brice told us briefly.\n\"Somebody else is going to lose the scent on a roof-top--and I'm going\nto watch.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe settled to our wait. To me it seemed absurdly hopeless. The flying\nfield was on a slight rise. Below us spread the dark shadow that was\nConstantinople. There was no moon to give it form and substance--it\nwas just a lake of deeper darkness, a spreading mass of silent\nroof-tops and minarets. How did Brice expect to see his quarry escape?\nSuppose he fled during the night? And even with daylight--\n\nThe first streaks of dawn found us still waiting, our ears strained\nfor the hum of an airplane motor. But hardly had the golden rim of the\nsun appeared over the horizon when it came. It came from the\neast--straight out of the golden glory of the sun. Nearer and nearer\nit came; an airplane--alone.\n\n\"It hasn't got the glider,\" muttered Foulet and his tone was tinged\nwith disappointment. But hardly had he spoken when, from one of the\nmyriad roof-tops below us, rose a swift streak of shadow. So fast it\nflew, with such unbelievable speed, that to our eyes it was little\nmore than a blur; but--\n\n\"The glider!\" Brice gasped. \"My God! How did he do it?\" We stared,\nsilent with amazement. The airplane, that only a second before had\nflown alone, now was towing a glider--a glider that had arisen, as if\nby magic, from the housetops!\n\nAnother instant and we had piled into the cockpit of the tri-motored\nplane and were off on our pursuit. That pursuit that led us on and on\ntill, as the sun sank behind us, we found ourselves above the\nillimitable, tawny wastes of the great Arabian Desert.\n\nAnd now--what? All day long, as I have said, the plane we were\npursuing had maintained, but never increased, the distance between us.\nEach hour had brought us renewed hope that the next hour would bring\ncapture--or at least some definite clue, some shred of information.\nBut the plane, still towing its glider, had gone on and on, steadily,\nimperturbably. And we dared not open fire and attempt to bring it down\nfor fear of destroying our one meager chance of following it to its\ndestination.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd now it had vanished. Suddenly, unaccountably it had taken on that\nterrific burst of speed which I have described. In ten minutes it had\nbecome a speck on the far horizon--in another instant it was gone. We\nwere alone. Night was falling. If we turned back our gas might bring\nus to safety. If we went on--what?\n\nI turned to my companions. Foulet still maintained his non-committal\nattitude, but Brice was deeply disappointed and worried. His ruddy\nEnglish face was knotted in a scowl and his blue eyes were dark.\nQuickly he jerked his head back. We understood. Of course, turning\nback was the only thing to do; to go on was absurd. Our quarry had\ntotally disappeared. But it was heart-breaking. Once again we had\nbeen fooled and outwitted. Our disappointment filled that tiny cockpit\nlike a tangible mist. Brice threw over the stick with a gesture of\ndisgust. In response our right wing lifted a bit, seemed to shake\nitself, then settled--and the plane continued on its course. Brice's\neyes flickered with surprise. He shoved the stick back, threw it over\nagain, but toward the opposite side. Obediently our left wing lifted\nas if to bank, a shudder passed through it, it dropped, the plane\nleveled, and went on.\n\nFoulet leaned forward, his eyes were gleaming, his face flushed and\neager. \"Climb!\" he yelled above the roar of the motors. \"Up!\" Brice\nnodded--but it was no use. That plane was like a live thing; nothing\nwe could do would swerve it from its course. We stared at one another.\nWere we mad? Were we under a hypnotic spell? But our minds were clear,\nand the idea of hypnosis was absurd, for we had tried to turn back. It\nwas the machine that refused to obey.\n\nAgain Foulet leaned forward. \"Drop!\" he shouted. Brice nodded, but the\nplane refused to respond. On and on, straight as a die, it sped.\n\n\"Try slowing the motor,\" I yelled into Brice's ear and both Foulet and\nI leaned forward to watch results.\n\nThe motors slowed. Gradually the roaring, pounding hum lessened, and\nour speed continued! The whine of the wind in the wires abated not one\nwhit! The speedometer on our instrument board climbed!\n\nBrice turned. His face, in the deepening dusk, was a blur of pasty\nwhite. His hands hung at his sides. The motors purred, pulsed, were\nsilent. The plane, unaided, unguided, flew alone!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe sat hushed and unbelieving in that terrible, deathlike silence. Our\nears, attuned all day to the deafening roar of the motors, felt as if\nthey would burst in the sudden, agonizing stillness. There was not a\nsound save the whine of the wind in the wires as the plane sped on.\nAbove us curved the illimitable arch of darkening sky. Below us lay\nthe empty stretch of blank desert.\n\nWe didn't speak. I know that I, for one, could not bring my voice to\nbreak that ominous stillness. Silently we sat there, watching,\nwaiting.... The quick darkness of the desert fell like a velvet\ncurtain. The stars burst forth as if lit by an invisible hand. Foulet\nstirred, leaned forward, gasped. My eyes followed his gaze. Before our\nplane spread a path of light, dull, ruddily glowing, like the ghost of\nlive embers. It cut the darkness of the night like a flaming\nfinger--and along it we sped as if on an invisible track!\n\n\"The speed of that other plane,\" muttered Brice, breaking that utter\nsilence, \"This was it!\"\n\nFoulet and I nodded. Well could I imagine that we were travelling at\nthat same terrific, impossible speed. And we were helpless--helpless\nin the clutch of--what? What power lay behind this band of light that\ndrew us irresistibly toward it?\n\nThe ruddy pathway brightened. The light grew stronger. Our speed\nincreased. The whine of the wires was tuned almost past human hearing.\nThe plane trembled like a live thing in the grip of inhuman forces. A\ngreat glowing eye suddenly burst from the rim of the horizon--the\nsource of the light! Instinctively I closed my eyes. What power might\nthat eye possess? The same thought must have struck Brice and Foulet\nfor they ducked to the floor of the cockpit, pulling me with them.\n\n\"Take care!\" Brice muttered, \"It might blind us.\"\n\nWe sat huddled in that cockpit for what seemed an eternity, though it\ncouldn't have been more than two minutes. The glare increased. It\nthrew into sharp, uncanny relief every tiny detail of the cockpit and\nof our faces. The light was as powerful as a searchlight, but not so\nblinding. It had a rosy, diffused quality that the searchlight lacks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn that eternity of tense waiting I tried to collect my thoughts. I\ntold myself that I must keep steady, that I must keep my mind clear. I\nstruggled to get a grip on myself; the light, the steady flying\nwithout power, the boundless, horrible silence had shaken me. But\nthere was more to come. I knew it. We all knew it. And it was not\nphysical strength that would pull us through--it was wits. We must\nhold steady. Thank God we all had years of training--war experience,\npeace experience, countless life-and-death adventures--behind us. It\nwould all count now. It would all help us to keep out brains clear and\ncool. Wits, I thought again, only our wits would stand between us\nand--what?\n\nThe ground wheels of the plane struck something solid; rolled;\nstopped! The light snapped off. The sudden blackness, falling like a\nblanket of thick fur, choked me. In that first dazed, gasping instant\nI was conscious of only one thing. The plane was no longer in motion.\nBut we had not dropped; of that I was sure. We were still, as we had\nbeen, close to two thousand feet above the earth!\n\nThen came the sound of running feet and a confused blur of voices. The\ndoor of the cockpit was thrown open. A man leaned in, his hand on the\njamb.\n\n\"Inspector Brice,\" he said quietly. \"Monsieur Foulet. Lieutenant\nAinslee. We are glad to welcome you.\" His words were courteous, but\nsomething in his tone sent a tingling chill down my spine. It was\ncold, as soulless as the clink of metal. It was dull, without life or\ninflection. But there was something else--something I could not name.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was nearest the door and scrambled out first. To my surprise it was\nnot dark. We were enveloped by a radiance, rosy as the broad ray had\nbeen, but fainter, like the afterglow of a sunset. By this light I\ncould make out, vaguely, our surroundings. We seemed to be on a\nplateau; a great flat space probably an acre in extent, surrounded by\na six-foot wall. Behind us there was a wide gateway through which our\nairplane had just come and across which workmen were dropping bars\nmade of some material like cement. Before us, dotting this acre or so\nof plateau, were small, domed structures made of the same cement-like\nmaterial. In the center of the plateau rose a larger domed building\nwith a segment of its roof open to the stars and through this opening\nI could see the shadowy suggestion of a great lamp. There was the\nsource of that powerful magnetic ray!\n\nFoulet and Brice scrambled out and stood beside me. They said never a\nword, but I knew that every sense was alert.\n\n\"If you will follow me,\" that same cold, expressionless voice\nmurmured. I turned to look at the man. He was not bad looking, clean\nshaven, well tailored. He swung his eyes to meet my gaze and as he did\nso that same chill fled along my spine. His eyes--what was the matter\nwith them? They were dark--brown or black--and as shiny as shoe\nbuttons. But there was no gleam of expression in them. Their shine was\nthe glitter of polished glass.\n\nWithout a word we followed him across the small cleared space where\nour airplane stood, past a row of the small, domed structures to a low\ndoor cut in the white wall of the great central building. At the\ndoorway he turned.\n\n\"I am taking you to the Master,\" he said; then, over his shoulder he\nadded. \"There is no means of escape--we are two thousand feet above\nthe earth!\" And he laughed--a quick, short cackle of crazy laughter. I\nfelt the breath catch in my throat and the short hairs prickle at my\nneck. Foulet gripped my arm. Through my coat I could feel the chill of\nhis fingers, but his grasp steadied me.\n\nWe walked on, following our guide. Down a narrow passageway, through a\nlow arched door into a small room, evidently an ante-chamber to a\nlarger room beyond. Without a word our guide left us, passing through\nanother door which he closed after him.\n\nBrice and Foulet and I exchanged looks, but we were silent. It might\nbe we were watched. It might be that the very walls had ears. We could\ntrust nothing.\n\nOur guide returned. \"The Master,\" he said and flung open a wide door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe found ourselves in a large room filled with paraphernalia of all\nsorts: wires, lights, laboratory tables cluttered with test tubes and\napparatus--and in the midst of this ordered chaos stood a man, his\ngleaming eyes watching us fixedly.\n\nAt first I was conscious of nothing but his eyes. Large, coal black\nand shiny with that peculiar, expressionless gloss I had noted in the\neyes of our guide. Later I realized that he was of slight build,\nmeticulously neat, with a tiny black waxed mustache and a carefully\ntrimmed Van Dyke beard.\n\n\"Welcome to my floating island,\" he said gravely, never swerving those\nshiny eyes for an instant. \"We have hoped long for your coming.\" He\npaused, noiselessly rubbing his hands, and watching us. We stared\nback, fascinated by that glossy, fixed gaze. \"There is much to tell\nyou,\" he went on, \"and to ask you.\" He permitted himself a slow smile\nthat spread his lips but failed to reach his eyes. \"During your stay\nhere,\" he continued, \"which I hope will be both long and profitable,\nyou will become my slaves and will know me as Master. But before you\ncome under my domination you may know my name.\"\n\nFor the first time he moved his eyes. His glance swept the room as if\nto assure himself we were alone. He stepped, as swiftly and softly as\na cat, over to the door through which we had entered, opened it, spoke\nto our guide who was waiting in the ante-room, closed it and returned.\nHe faced us, his lips smiling and his eyes as blank as polished agate.\n\n\"My name,\" he said softly, \"is Algernon--Frederick--Fraser!\" He paused\nand watched us. Behind me I felt Foulet start; I heard Brice's quickly\nsuppressed gasp. My own throat closed on words that might have been\nfatal. Algernon Frederick Fraser! Was it possible? Could it be?\n\nFive years before Fraser had suddenly burst on the world of science.\nHe had made some amazing discoveries regarding the power of light;\ndiscoveries that would reorganize the living conditions of the world.\nFor a week or two the papers were filled with the man's amazing\ngenius; then no more was heard of him. Had he died? What was the\nstory?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo years passed and even the name of Fraser was forgotten. Then\nsuddenly it burst forth again in the headlines of the world. Fraser\nhad disappeared! Fraser had vanished! But not as a brilliant genius of\nscience; he had gone as an escaped lunatic! After his amazing burst of\nfame his mind snapped. Somehow the story had been kept out of the\npress.\n\nFraser was incarcerated in a quiet, very private asylum, and that was\nall. All--until he escaped. When that happened the story couldn't be\nhushed any longer. The press was informed, the people were warned. He\nbecame known as the Mad Menace. The police and secret service\norganizations of the world searched for him. His name became a byword.\nWhere had he gone? What would he do? What was his scheme? For he was\nstill the astounding scientific genius. That portion of his mind was\nuntouched. At the time of his escape the physicians in charge of the\ncase assured the press that Fraser's scientific mind was every bit as\nsound as ever.\n\nAnd that was all. Aside from his god Science he was a maniac--inhuman,\ncruel, unreasoning. What would such a man do loosed in the world? What\nmight he not do? Was it possible that it was this man who stood before\nus now with his eyes fastened upon us so intently and his lips spread\nin that little, empty smile? Suddenly I knew! Those eyes! Those eyes\nwere the shiny, vacuous, soulless eyes of a madman!\n\n\"I see,\" he said softly, \"that you have heard of me. But it is three\nyears since your world has seen me--yes?\" He laughed--a low laugh that\nseemed to freeze the air around him. \"They call me mad.\" His smile\nfaded, his eyes bored through us like steel needles. \"I am not mad! No\nmadman could do what I have done in three years!\" For the first time\nan expression flickered in his eyes--a crafty gleam of vanity that\nflared instantaneously. \"Would you like to see?\" He leaned toward us.\nWe bowed, but it was Brice who spoke.\n\n\"Very much, Doctor Fraser--\"\n\n\"Don't call me that!\" The man whirled like a tiger ready to spring.\n\"Don't call me that! I am Master here! Call me Master! Say it.\" His\nvoice rose to a shriek. \"Say it--Master!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI clamped my teeth against the bloodless horror of that maniacal\nvoice. It chilled my veins. Again I felt the hair rise on my scalp.\nBrice bowed quietly; and his eyes, serene and blue, met Fraser's\nfairly.\n\n\"Of course, Master.\" His low English voice soothed the bristling\nsilence. \"I am sure I speak for Monsieur Foulet and Lieutenant Ainslee\nwhen I say that we would be most deeply interested in your\nachievements.\"\n\nFraser was placated. He relaxed. He softly rubbed his hands while a\nsmug, crafty smile flitted across his lips. \"You will follow me,\" he\nmurmured.\n\nHe led the way back through the ante-room and down the passageway till\nwe stood again under the stars, and again I was struck by the strange\nlight, warm and faint and rosy like a sunset afterglow. As if he read\nmy thought Fraser turned to me.\n\n\"I will show you first the source of this rosy light; that, I believe,\nwill explain a great deal.\" He led the way down one of the narrow\npathways between the low, domed houses--if they could be called\nhouses, for they were little larger than kennels. At the six-foot wall\nthat surrounded this plateau he paused. \"Would you like to look over\nthe wall?\" he asked.\n\nFor the space of a breath we hesitated. Was this a trap? Through my\nmind flashed the words of the man who had guided us to Fraser. \"You\nare two thousand feet above the earth,\" he had said. Was that true?\nAnd if it were, might not Fraser push us over the wall? But instantly\nlogic came to my rescue. Fraser had brought us here, and he could have\nbrought us for but one thing: to question us. Would he be apt to do us\nharm before those questions were asked? And besides, would Fraser's\nbrilliantly subtle mind stoop so low as to destroy enemies by pushing\nthem over a wall?\n\n\"Thank you,\" we murmured simultaneously. \"This whole achievement is of\ntremendous interest to us,\" Foulet added.\n\nFraser chuckled. \"It will be of greater interest--later,\" he said, and\nhis blank, glittering eyes rested on first one of us, then another\nwith a cold, satisfied gleam. Then he lifted his hand and opened a\nsquare door in the wall about the size of a port-hole. To my surprise\nthe little door swung back as lightly as a feather and made scarcely a\nsound as it slammed against the wall itself. Again Fraser answered my\nunspoken thought.\n\n\"It has only substance,\" he said with his vain smirk. \"No weight\nwhatever. This entire platform together with its huts is lighter than\nair. If I should tear loose this little door it would float out of my\nhands instantly and go straight up to the stars. The substance--I have\ncalled it Fleotite--is not only lighter than air but lighter than\nether.\"\n\n\"But we are not floating,\" said Brice; \"we are stationary. Is the\nlightness of your Fleotite counteracted by the weight of the men and\nmachines?\"\n\nFraser shook his head. \"Not entirely,\" he said. \"But first look\nthrough this little window. Then I will explain.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEagerly we pressed forward. Our danger was almost forgotten in our\ninterest. This was amazing--stupendous! Together, shoulder to\nshoulder, we gazed through the aperture. We were suspended in space!\nAbove us shone the blue-black Arabian night, and beneath us--far, far\nbeneath--lay the sands of the desert looking rosy and warm in that\nsame dull red glare of light that, to a fainter degree, gave us the\neffect of afterglow. But we were not floating; we were anchored as\nsecurely as a ship riding in a calm harbor.\n\nWe turned back to Fraser, amazed, awed, bursting with questions.\nMadman he might be, but he had wrought a miracle.\n\n\"I will explain,\" he said and his eyes gleamed with pride. \"Of course\nyou know of my tremendous discoveries connected with the power of\nlight. At any rate, five years ago, the scientific world on earth\nthought they were tremendous. In reality that was nothing to my\namazing strides in the past three years. There is nothing that cannot\nbe done with light! Nothing!\" For the first time Fraser's eyes became\nalive. They were illumined. His whole body seemed to radiate light and\nfire and genius. We listened, fascinated.\n\n\"Take, for instance,\" he continued eagerly, \"that ray with which I\ndrew you and your plane to me. That ray is the pure power of\nmagnetism. At full strength it will draw anything to it instantly.\nFortunately the power can be regulated: I can switch a lever in my\nlaboratory and draw things to me, via the ray, at any speed I\nwish--one hundred, two hundred, a thousand miles an hour.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"How far can you throw the ray?\" asked Foulet, and I knew he was\nthinking of that glider that rose from the roof-tops of\nConstantinople. Fraser also knew he was thinking of that.\n\n\"I did not draw the glider,\" he said quietly. \"The airplane I sent did\nthat. My airplanes carry batteries of this ray. In the beginning I\nfound gliders to be more practical for my purposes than airplanes. For\none thing they were silent. My only problem was that of getting them\noff the ground. Once they were in the air I could manage everything.\nIt was this problem that inspired this discovery and perfection of the\nray. But, you asked how far I can throw the ray? This main lamp, that\nI operate myself from here, is effective at two hundred miles. At one\nhundred miles it enjoys its full power.\"\n\n\"And you can draw anything to you,\" asked Brice, \"within the radius of\nthe magnetic ray?\"\n\n\"Anything in the air,\" answered Fraser. \"But of course I must use\ncaution. Great caution. If I drew planes to me indiscriminately I\nwould draw attention to myself; my secret and my location here would\nleak out. No. That must not be. So the only planes I bring are my\nown--and yours.\" He paused and his black eyes, again glassy, swept\nover us. \"It is a compliment I pay you,\" he said finally. \"You have\nbecome too troublesome. You know too much. Sooner or later the time\nwould come when you would combine your forces. That would be a\nnuisance. So I decided to bring you here.\"\n\n\"Suppose,\" asked Foulet curiously, \"we hadn't fallen into your trap?\nSuppose we had turned back before reaching the point where your ray is\neffective?\"\n\nFraser shook his head and that smug, offensive smile appeared again.\n\"You were trapped from the beginning, though you didn't know it,\" he\nsaid. \"The plane you were following was equipped with batteries of the\nray which, while not as powerful as the lamp I have here, were still\npowerful enough to hold you to the course we choose you to run. But\nenough of the ray,\" he added impatiently. \"There are one or two other\nthings I want to explain and then--\" he paused and the pause, somehow,\nwas alive with menace. What was he going to do after he had finished\ntreating us as honored guests? For the third time he answered my\nunspoken question. His eyes narrowed till they were black, glittering\nslits. His voice, as he leaned toward us, was no more than a hissing\nwhisper.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Slaves!\" he said, and his lips twisted. \"How will you like to be\nslaves of Mad Algy Fraser?\" He laughed--a chuckle that started in his\nthroat and rose and rose till it seemed to shatter my ear-drums. I\nfelt my teeth grinding together and my nails bit my palms in my effort\nto control my nerves against the strain of that maniacal glee.\nSuddenly he sobered. His laugh died instantly like a radio that had\nbeen snapped off. \"Listen and I will tell you. I will tell you\neverything because it is necessary for you to know so that you may\nwork for me intelligently and you will remember better and be of\ngreater use to me if I tell you now while you are yet--sane!\"\n\n\"Sane!\" The exclamation sprang from the three of us simultaneously. I\nfelt a cold chill start between my shoulder blades. For an instant my\nbreath choked in my throat. My heart paused--and then raced. What did\nhe mean? What was he going to do to us? What scheme had he evolved in\nhis crazed brain?\n\n\"I have perfected a serum\"--his tone was professional, cold; he might\nhave been talking to a class in a lecture room--\"a serum that robs the\npatient of every vestige of human emotion--and therefore sanity. All\nhis intellect, his memories, however, remain, to serve him in carrying\nout my orders. He loses all his will to live and resist, and becomes\nnothing but an automaton, whose complete mental equipment is at my\ncommand.\"\n\nThere was silence. His glassy black eyes, blank and soulless, swept\nover us. His mouth curled in that smug, complacent smile. He had us\nwith our shoulders to the floor. He knew it--and he knew we knew it.\nThere was no possible way we could escape. We were two thousand feet\nabove the earth. Our plane wouldn't get a quarter of a mile before the\nmagnetic ray would bring it back. Parachute? Even supposing we could\nget parachutes where would we go? Drop two thousand feet into the\nmiddle of the Arabian Desert?\n\nMy brain raced. Never before had I been in such a tight place. And\nsoon--if Fraser had his way--I wouldn't even have a mind to think\nwith! I felt choked, stifled. Was there no way out? It seemed to me\nthat a blanket--a soft, terrible blanket of uncontrollable\ncircumstance--was being folded around me, robbing me of the use of my\nlimbs, paralyzing me, numbing me. And out of this terrible\nhelplessness came again Fraser's voice.\n\n\"I have told you enough,\" he said suavely, \"so that you may have a\nfaint idea of my power. I will send you now to Doctor Semple who will\nadminister the serum and place you under the 'nourishment ray.' This\nis another of my discoveries,\" he added casually. \"It is a ray which\nallows the patient to absorb, through the shell of the skin,\nsufficient nourishment, both solid and liquid, to last for twenty-four\nhours.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFive minutes later we stood in a small room that might have been the\noffice of an up-to-date physician anywhere in the world. Across the\npolished top of a mahogany desk Dr. Semple stared at us, his eyes,\nlike the eyes of our guide and Fraser, polished and expressionless.\nBut now we understood. Those eyes were expressionless because there\nwas nothing to give them expression. I tried to force my mind to\ncomprehend the almost incomprehensible. We were among men who were not\nmen! We were fast in the power of human beings who possessed no trace\nof humanity, who had become nothing but scientific Robots even though\nthey still had bodies of flesh and blood! It was unbelievable! My\nhands grew cold and my brain hot at the thought. Yet, gazing into the\nbright, enamelled eyes of Dr. Semple, I knew it was true.\n\nCarefully, scientifically, we were prepared for our injections. And\nwith every mechanical move of the doctor my mind seemed to take on\nfresh speed as it raced toward some solution to our terrible problem.\nMy eyes flew around the tiny office searching for some means of\nescape. Doctor Semple turned to prepare the syringe. Behind his back\nBrice gestured frantically. Somehow I understood. In my pocket was a\nflask--a flask I had filled with drinking water in Constantinople.\nBewildered, I handed it over to him.\n\nThe doctor turned, swabbed a patch of iodine on our arms, reached for\nthe syringe. As he leaned over, Foulet thrust forward a foot. The\ndoctor tripped, sprawled full length on the floor. Foulet and I\nquickly stooped to pick him up, standing between him and\nBrice--shielding his eyes so that he could not see. We fumbled to give\nBrice time. We apologized and soothed. Out of the tail of my eye I\ncould see Brice working like lightning--emptying out the syringe of\nthat villainous liquid, filling it with clear water.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was done! We raised the doctor to his feet; gave his clothes a\nfinal brush. But as we stood back I know my hands were trembling and I\nhad to clamp my teeth to keep them from chattering. Were we out of\ndanger yet? Would the doctor discover our ruse? And, if we got out of\nhis office without receiving the terrible injection, could we\nsuccessfully fool Fraser and his \"slaves\" into believing we were mad?\nFool them until we got a chance to escape? Could we simulate that\nglassy stare? Were we sufficiently good actors to get away with it?\nThe questions pounded and raced through my brain in that instant when\nDoctor Semple turned again to his desk and picked up the syringe.\n\nBut the miracle happened! Mechanically he gave us the injection--never\nsuspecting that it was not the devilish liquid he had put in, but only\nclear water! Then he stepped back and watched us. Cold chills raced up\nand down my spine. What were we supposed to do now? What was the\naction of the serum? Did it act at once or slowly? Was it supposed to\nmake us sick? Did it send us to sleep? How could we simulate symptoms\nwhen we had no idea what these symptoms were supposed to be? But the\ncold voice of the doctor cut sharply across my agonized questions.\n\n\"You will lie down here,\" he said, opening a door into a room whose\ntrails were lined with bunks, like an opium den. \"In half an hour I\nwill come for you. By that time--\" His lips spread in that same\ntravesty of a smile Fraser had employed.\n\nWe filed into the room and the door closed behind us. Obediently we\nlay down on the narrow bunks. We dared not speak. We scarcely dared\nglance at each other. We must act, at all times, as if we were\nobserved. Might not Fraser have a ray that could penetrate walls?\nMight he not, even now, know that we had outwitted the doctor and had\nnot received the fatal injection? And what then? Suppose Fraser\nhimself superintended another injection? I pulled my thoughts back\nfrom the terrible supposition. One thing at a time. So far all had\ngone well. I lay down on the bunk and closed my eyes.\n\nHalf an hour later we heard the door open. Now, I, thought, when I\nlook up, I am supposed to be mad! I struggled to make my mind a blank.\nI tried to force into my eyes that peculiar, brilliant, shiny, vacant\nexpression I had noticed. Would I succeed?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI raised my eyes. The doctor was standing before us. With a gesture he\nbade Foulet go to him. I watched beneath lowered lids. Thank God he\nhad called Foulet first. Foulet had dabbled in the psychology of\ninsanity. Foulet would know how to act, and I would ape him. Coldly,\nmechanically Doctor Semple ran him through a few tests. I watched with\nbated breath. The doctor nodded. Foulet had passed!\n\nIt was my turn. I did exactly as Foulet had done--and succeeded! I\nhad to turn away swiftly so that the doctor wouldn't see the gleam of\ntriumph in my supposedly mad eyes.\n\nHe motioned to Brice. But just as Brice stepped forward the door\nopened and Fraser came into the room. For an instant everything\nreeled. We were gone! But even in that terrible instant of despair I\nremembered to keep my eyes blank. No trace of expression must appear\nor we were lost. I stretched my lips in that travesty of a smile I had\nseen the others use. Fraser stared at us, one after the other. He\nnodded.\n\n\"It is well,\" he said slowly and distinctly as if he were talking to\nsmall children. \"Your names will still be as they were.\" We stared at\nhim blankly and again he nodded. \"You have forgotten your names--ah!\nYours,\" he pointed to me, \"was Ainslee, and it still is. And you are\nMonsieur Foulet. But Brice--\" he paused. My heart hung in my breast,\nsuspended there with terror. What was the matter with Brice? What did\nFraser suspect--or know? He turned to the doctor. \"You will give\nInspector Brice another injection,\" he said. \"The Inspector has a\nstrong mind, and a clever one. A normal injection would not be\nenough.\"\n\nIt seemed to me that my blood froze. In that terrible instant it ran,\nlike tingling ice, through my veins. Brice! The brainiest man in\nScotland Yard! For Fraser was right. Brice had more brains than Foulet\nand I together. And in another half hour Brice would be no better than\nan idiot! For I didn't fool myself. Even Brice couldn't outwit Doctor\nSemple twice.\n\n\"You will follow me,\" said Fraser, turning to Foulet and me. \"I will\nput you under the nourishment ray while Doctor Semple attends to\nBrice.\" Obediently, with slightly shuffling, gait and vacant eyes we\nfollowed him into an adjoining room, leaving Brice behind. I didn't\neven trust myself to glance at him as we left. But my heart was in my\nboots. When would we see him again? And what would he be?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe room we entered was dark, but instantly Fraser switched on a\nmellow, orange-colored light, that flooded the room with a deep, warm\nglow.\n\n\"Strip yourselves and sit down,\" he said, pointing to deep lounging\nchairs that filled the room. \"You will do nothing. Relax and allow the\nlight to bathe you. In half an hour I will come back with\ninstructions.\"\n\nWe obeyed, I imitating blindly every vague, mechanical movement of\nFoulet's. We settled ourselves in the comfortable chairs and Fraser\nleft us. He had told us to relax--but to do anything else would have\nbeen impossible. The light soothed us, eased us; gave us, somehow, a\npenetrating sensation of peace and complete comfort. It flowed around\nus, warming us, lulling us to a delicious dreamy state that was\nneither waking nor sleeping. It wiped out danger; it wiped out Time;\nnothing existed but this warm and relaxing sense of utter satisfaction\nand peace.\n\nThrough this mist of contentment came Fraser's voice, \"That is all!\"\nThe light faded gradually, and as gradually we came to ourselves. \"You\nwill dress,\" directed Fraser in the same clear, clipped manner, \"and\nyou will come to me in my laboratory.\"\n\nFifteen minutes later we stood before him, vacant-eyed and solemn.\nFraser fastened his black, polished eyes upon us. \"You will tell me,\"\nhe said distinctly, \"all you know.\"\n\nWe were silent. How could we tell him all we knew when we were\nsupposed to have forgotten everything? Was this a trap? Or did our\ninside secret service information come under the general head of\nScience? But before these questions had actually formed in my mind I\nremembered that several times Fraser had answered my questions before\nthey were asked. Might he be a mind reader? Best to take no chances! I\nmade my conscious mind as blank as possible and gazed back at him. At\nmy side Foulet made a vague and uncertain noise in his throat.\n\n\"Your countries are afraid of me?\" Fraser leaned forward, that smug,\nvain smile curling his lips. \"Your countries know there is a power\nabroad stronger than they? They feel that between the twin horns of\neconomic pressure and the red menace they will be tossed to\ndestruction?\n\n\"Destruction?\" repeated Foulet with all the vacant inflection of\nidiocy.\n\n\"Tossed?\" I asked imitating Foulet. But instantly I wondered if we\nwere taking the right tack for Fraser's eyes grew red with fury.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Answer me!\" he raged. \"Tell me that your countries know that soon I\nshall be master of the world! Tell me they are afraid of me! Tell me\nthat in the last three years I have slowly gained control of commerce,\nof gold! Tell me that they know I hold the economic systems of the\nworld in the hollow of my hand! Tell me that not a government on earth\nbut knows it is hanging on the brink of disaster! And I--I put it\nthere! My agents spread the propaganda of ruin! My agents crashed your\nWall Street and broke your banks! I! I! I! Mad Algy Fraser!\" He\nstopped, gasping for breath. His face was scarlet. His eyes glowed\nlike red coals. Suddenly he burst into a cascade of maniacal laughter,\nhigh, insane, terrible.\n\nIt took all my control to keep my eyes blank, my face devoid of\nexpression. Out of the tail of my eye I saw Foulet smiling, a vague,\nidiotic smile of sympathy with Fraser's glee. But suddenly the glee\ndied--as suddenly as if a button had snapped off the current. He\nleaned forward, his black eyes devouring our faces.\n\n\"They are afraid of me?\" It was a whisper, sharply eager. \"The world\nknows I am Master?\"\n\n\"Master,\" repeated Foulet. It wasn't quite a question, yet neither was\nit sufficiently definite as an answer to arouse Fraser's suspicions.\nTo my relief it satisfied him. The congested blood drained out of his\nface. His eyes lost their glare. He turned and for several minutes\ntramped up and down the laboratory lost in thought. At last he came\nback to us.\n\n\"I have changed my mind,\" he muttered. \"Come with me.\"\n\nWithout a word we followed him, out through the door and down the\npassageway. Out of the building he led us. The air was stirring with\nthe first breath of dawn and along the horizon glowed a band of pure\ngold where the sun would soon rise. When he had walked some thirty\nyards from the laboratory Fraser paused. With his toe he touched a\nspring in the platform. A trap door instantly yawned at our feet. I\nsuppressed a start just in time, but through my body shot a thrill of\nfear. My muscles tensed. My heart raced. What now? Where could a trap\ndoor, two thousand feet above the earth lead? Was he going to shove us\ninto space because we refused to answer his questions?\n\n\"Go down,\" Fraser ordered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the space of a breath we hesitated. To disobey meant certain and\ninstant death at the hands of this soulless maniac. But to obey--to\ndrop through this trap-door--also meant death. I took a step forward.\nCould we overpower him? But what if we did? There were others here\nbeside Fraser. How many others I had no idea, but surely enough to\nmake things impossible for Foulet and me. Yet we dared not even\nhesitate. To hesitate implied thinking--and a man robbed of his brain\ncannot think! There was no way out. Together Foulet and I stepped to\nthe brink of the yawning hole....\n\nFor an instant we were almost blinded by a glare of rosy light that\nseemed to burst upon us from the earth so far below. Here was the\nsource of that strange afterglow! Away beneath us, evidently on the\nsands of the Arabian desert, glowed four red eyes sending forth the\nrosy rays that converged at the center of the floating platform.\nInstantly I comprehended Fraser's scheme. The Fleotite he had\ninvented, and of which the platform and buildings were made, was\nlighter than air. It followed, therefore, that if it were not anchored\nin some way it would instantly rise. So Fraser had anchored it with\nfour of his magnetic rays! He had told us that he could regulate the\npulling power of the ray, so what he had obviously done was to\ncalculate to a nicety the lift of the Fleotite against the magnetism\nof the rays.\n\nBut instantaneously with this thought came another. Fraser was urging\nus into the glow of the magnetic ray! If once our bodies came entirely\nwithin the ray we would be yanked from the platform and dashed to\ndeath--sucked to destruction on the sands below.\n\nIn my ear I heard Fraser's fiendish chuckle. \"The instinct of fear\nstill holds, eh? My serum can destroy your conscious mind--but not\nyour native fear? Cowards! Fools! But I am not going to push you off.\nLook!\" With his foot he pressed another lever which, while it did not\nshut off any of the light, seemed to deflect the ray. \"Fools!\" he said\nagain scornfully. \"Go down!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen it was I saw where he was sending us! Thirty feet below the\nplatform there swung a small cabin, attached by cables and reached by\na swinging steel ladder. As I looked a door in the roof slid back.\n\"Climb down!\" ordered Fraser again. There was nothing to do but obey.\nAccustomed as I was to flying, inured as I had become to great\nheights, my head reeled and my hands grew icy as I swung myself\nthrough that trap door and felt for a footing on the swinging ladder.\nSuppose Fraser turned the ray back on us as we climbed down? Suppose\nhe cut the ladder? But instantly my good sense told me he would do\nneither. If he had meant to kill us he could have done it easier than\nthis. No, somewhere in his mad head, he had a reason for sending us\ndown to this swinging cabin.\n\nFive minutes later Foulet and I stared at each other in the cramped\nconfines of our prison. The tiny door in the roof, through which we\nhad dropped, was closed. The steel ladder had been pulled up. We were\nalone. Alone? Were there no eyes that watched us still, or ears that\nlistened to what we might say? Foulet evidently shared my sense of\nespionage, for, without even a glance at me, he lay down on the hard\nfloor of our bare little cabin and, to all intents and purposes, fell\nasleep.\n\nFor a few minutes I stood staring at him, then followed his example.\nAs I relaxed I realized I was tremendously weary. The cumulative\nexhaustion of the past thirty-six hours seemed to crowd upon me with a\nsmothering sense of physical oppression. I looked at my watch and\nwound it. Five o'clock. Through the narrow slits near the roof of our\nswinging cell I could see the changing light of dawn, melting in with\nthe rosy glow from the magnetic rays. My eyelids drooped heavily....\n\nWhen I awoke Foulet was standing near me, his arms folded across his\nchest, scowling thoughtfully. He nodded as he saw my open eyes, but\nwhen I started to speak he shook his head sharply. With his gesture\nthere flooded back to me the feeling that we were watched--even\nthrough the walls of our aerial prison and the floor of the platform\nabove us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI sat up and, clasping my knees with my hands, leaned against the\nwall. There must be a way out of this for us! All my life I had worked\non the theory that if you thought hard enough there was a way out of\nany difficulty. But this seemed so hopeless! No matter how hard we\nthought the mad mind of Fraser would always be one jump ahead of us!\nAnd maybe we didn't dare even think! If Fraser were able to read\nminds--as I was nearly sure he was--then hadn't we better keep our\nminds blank even down here? But an instant's thought showed me the\nflaw in my logic. Fraser could, without much doubt, read minds--when\nthose minds were close to him. If he could read minds at a distance\nthen he wouldn't need to ask us for information.\n\nBut why had he put us here? I burrowed around for the answer. Had he\nguessed we had outwitted Doctor Semple and not taken the mad serum\nafter all, and was this punishment? No, if Fraser had guessed that he\nwould simply have given us more serum, as he had Brice. Brice! Where\nwas poor Brice now? Was he an idiot, with blank face and shiny,\nsoulless eyes? My mind shuddered away from the thought, taking refuge\nin my first question: Why were we here? What was Fraser going to do\nwith us?\n\nWe lost all track of time. In spite of my winding it my watch stopped\nand the hours slipped by uncounted. Night came, and another dawn and\nanother night. Twice our roof was lifted and our tiny swinging cell\nfilled with the orange light of the nourishment ray. But we saw no one\nnor did anyone speak to us. The third day passed in the same isolated\nsilence. Occasionally Foulet or I would utter a monosyllable; the\nsound of our voices was comforting and the single words would convey\nlittle to a listener.\n\nBut as the hours of the third night slowly passed the atmosphere in\nour tiny swinging cell grew tense. Something was going to happen. I\ncould feel it and I knew by Foulet's eyes that he felt it too. The air\nwas tight, electrical. Standing on tiptoe, I glued my eyes to the\nnarrow slit which was our only ventilation. But I could see nothing.\nThe brilliant rosy glow blinded me. I couldn't even see the huge\nplatform floating above our heads.\n\nThen, suddenly, our roof slid back. The magnetic ray was deflected.\nAbove us, in the opening of the trap-door, leered the bright, mad eyes\nof Fraser.\n\n\"Good evening,\" he said mockingly. \"How do you feel?\" We smiled\nhesitantly. Something in his voice made me feel he was addressing us\nas sane men and not idiots. But why? Weren't we supposed to be idiots\nwhen he put us down there?\n\n\"You ought to feel all right,\" Fraser went on critically. \"The first\ndose of that serum lasts only three days. It's cumulative,\" he added\nwith his professional air. \"In the beginning an injection every three\ndays. Then once a week and so on. There's a man who has been with me\nfor three years who needs treatment only once every three months.\nWell, are you ready to talk?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo that was it! He had put us down here till the supposed effects of\nthat serum had worn off; and now we were to talk; tell him everything\nhis agents had been risking their lives to find out! We were to sell\nout our countries to him; betray all the secrets we had sworn by\neternity to keep! If we did as he demanded both France and the United\nStates would be at his mercy--and he had no mercy! He was not a man;\nhe was a cruel, power-loving, scientific machine. I clamped my teeth.\nNever would I talk! I had sworn to protect my country's secrets with\nmy life--and my vow would be kept!\n\n\"You will talk?\" Fraser asked again, his voice suddenly suave and\nbeseeching. \"For those who talk there are--rewards.\"\n\n\"Let down the ladder,\" said Foulet, in a quiet, conversational tone.\n\"It will be easier to discuss this--\"\n\nFraser's eyes narrowed to gleaming slits. He smiled craftily. \"The\nladder will be let down--when you talk.\"\n\n\"And if,\" suggested Foulet, \"we don't wish to talk?\"\n\nFraser's lips stretched in a wider grin. His white teeth gleamed. His\nshiny black eyes glittered. In that warm, rosy light he looked like a\ndemon from hell. He held out his hand. In it shone a long, slender\ninstrument.\n\n\"This knife,\" he said softly, \"Will cut the steel cables that connect\nyou to this platform--as if they were cheese! You will talk?\" Beside\nme I heard Foulet gasp. Swiftly my imagination conjured up the picture\nof our fate. Our determined refusal to divulge the secrets of our\nrespective countries; the severing, one by one, of the four cables\nholding us to the platform; the listing of our swinging cell; the\ntipping, the last, terrible plunge two thousand feet. But it would be\nswift. The power of the magnetic ray would give us no time to\nthink--to suffer. It would be a merciful end....\n\n\"Let us up,\" bargained Foulet. \"We will talk.\" Fraser laughed.\n\n\"None of that,\" he said slyly. \"You talk from there and if your\ninformation doesn't dove-tail with what I already know--\" he\nflourished the steel knife suggestively.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were caught! No amount of bluff would save us now. Fraser demanded\nthat truth, facts, actual information--and he wouldn't be fooled by\nanything spurious. Foulet's shoulder touched mine as we peered up\nthrough the roof of our cell at our mad captor. We spoke together:\n\n\"There is nothing to say.\"\n\nThe assured smile left Fraser's lips. His eyes glittered red. His\nwhole mad face was contorted with fury. A volley of oaths poured\nthrough his twisted mouth. With a gesture of insane rage he pulled the\nnearest cable to him and slashed it with the knife!\n\nOur cell tilted. Foulet and I were thrown in a heap on the floor. We\nsprang up to face Fraser again through the roof. His mad eyes glared\ndown at us, soul-chilling, maniacal.\n\n\"Talk!\" he snarled. \"Talk--or I'll slice another!\" He drew the second\ncable to him, holding it in readiness.\n\nI clenched my teeth. Beside me I could see the muscles of Foulet's jaw\nworking. Talk? Never!\n\n\"Talk!\" screamed Fraser. \"Talk!\" Our silence and our white faces were\nhis only answer. There was a gleam of the knife in the rosy light. Our\ncell lurched, quivered, then caught. Would it hold with only two\ncables? It was hanging on its side. We were standing on what had been\nthe wall. Through the opening in the roof we could see nothing but\nrosy light and distant stars. How strong were the cables? Could they\nhold against the pull of the magnetic ray? We could feel the pull now;\nfeel the strain on the cables above us. If Fraser cut the third one--\n\n\"Talk!\" his voice came, hoarse with fury. \"Talk now! You can't see\nme,\" he went on; \"but I'm pulling the third cable toward me. I'm\nraising the knife. Will you talk?\"\n\nStanding on that quaking wall Foulet and I stared at each other. How\nlong would it be? One second? Half a minute? Thank God it would be\nquick! This was the worst now. This eternity of waiting.... \"I'm\ncutting it!\" yelled Fraser--and with his words the cell lurched,\nswung, whirled like a spinning top. Foulet and I were tossed around\nlike dried peas in a pod.\n\nSuddenly the thing steadied. Two steel hooks were clamped on the edge\nof the opening in what had been the roof, and Brice stared at us\nthrough the aperture!\n\n\"Quick!\" he gasped. \"There's not a second to lose. Don't stare! Quick,\nI say. I've got the ladder here. It's steel and it'll hold. Climb up.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDumbly we obeyed. Our heads were whirling, our bodies bruised and\nmashed by the shaking up. Blindly, dizzily we climbed up the ladder,\nscrambled out on the platform. Solid footing again! As Brice loosed\nthe ladder and pulled it up, there was a snap. The last cable had\ngone! The cell shot down to earth with a speed that must have reduced\nit to a powder. Foulet and I stared after it, dazed, unbelieving.\nBrice's whisper hissed in our ears.\n\n\"Listen carefully,\" he gripped our shoulders. \"I'm not mad. They shot\nthe stuff into me, but I found an antidote in Semple's office and used\nit right away. Now listen to me! Our plane is over there,\" he pointed\nacross the platform. \"It's all ready to take off. They think they're\nsending me off on an errand for them at dawn. It's ready for a long\ntrip. Go there; get in; and if any one questions you tell them it's\norders. They won't, though. No one gives orders here but Fraser.\"\nBrice nodded toward a dark heap beside the trap-door.\n\n\"You killed him?\" asked Foulet.\n\n\"Stunned him,\" said Brice. \"He may come to at any moment and if he\ndoes--\"\n\n\"Suppose we bind him and take him in the plane?\" I suggested.\n\nBrice shook his head. \"Leave him here. It's safer. Now go. Get in the\nplane and take off--\"\n\n\"And not wait for you?\" I gasped, \"You're crazy--\"\n\n\"I'll be there. You can pick me up later. There's no time to\nexplain--but you'll know. Take off; then circle around and come back.\nBut watch out!\" He gave us both a shove toward the plane, the dim\nshadow of which we could see across the platform.\n\nWe took a step toward it, and then turned back. How could we go\nwithout Brice? But he had vanished. And in the shadow of the trap door\nFraser groaned.\n\nWe waited no longer. To hesitate was to court death. Deliberately, as\nif we were acting under orders, we walked toward the plane. As Brice\nhad said, it was in readiness. Evidently he was to have started at\nonce. We climbed in, our hearts in our throats. A mechanic stepped\nforward. The propeller roared. But, above the roar of the propeller we\nheard a yell of fury--and Fraser, dazed and reeling, came stumbling\nacross the platform toward us!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFoulet took the controls. The plane taxied across the platform,\nswooped into space. But it was not till it had risen and steadied that\nI realized the complete idiocy of our forlorn hope of escape. What\nfools we were! And Brice--Brice must, in truth, be mad! How could we\nget away? How could we ever escape the terrific power of the magnetic\nray? That ray that Fraser worked himself from his laboratory--the ray\nthat had drawn us first across the desert to this floating island of\nmadness! It would be a matter of seconds before Fraser would reach it\nand turn it on us. There was no escape--none!\n\nIn despair I looked back at the platform. To eyes ignorant of its\nhorror it would have been an amazing and gorgeous sight. The crimson\nlamps of the magnetic ray bloomed like huge desert flowers on the sand\ntwo thousand feet below us; the rays flamed up with the glory of an\nItalian sunset and, poised in space like a dark butterfly, floated the\nhuge platform bathed in its rosy light. It was beautiful. It was\nunbelievable. It was horrible. I gazed, fascinated. When would Fraser\nreach the lamp? When would he turn it on? I stared at the dark shadow\nthat I knew was the laboratory building. My eyes strained through the\ngrowing distance. When would the glow come? That glow that meant our\ndeath!\n\nSuddenly I gasped. The light had gone! The great lamps down on the\ndesert floor were out! Darkness, swift, comforting, wrapped us in\nvelvet folds.\n\n\"Brice!\" I yelled. \"Brice has cut off the lamps--he's released the\nplatform. God! Look--Foulet!\" My voice tore through my throat; my eyes\nburned with sudden, blinding emotion. In the soft darkness of the\nstarry night I could see the platform waver, topple, rise! It rose\nstraight up, tilting and swaying in the light breeze. What was it\nFraser had said? If it was released it would go straight to the stars!\nIt was on its way!\n\nBut Brice! Where was Brice? Was he on that terrible rising island? I\nstrained my eyes through the darkness. Already Foulet had banked the\nplane--we were circling; turning back. A tiny white speck took shape\nbeneath the rising island. A parachute! Brice was safe!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTen minutes later we slid along the hard desert sand and came to a\nstop. Brice came running over toward us. Foulet and I climbed out of\nthe plane to meet him. Silently we gripped hands. It was a solemn\nmoment. Beside us reared the great plane that would take us back to\nsafety--back to the familiar life we knew and loved. Around us\nstretched the trackless wastes of the Great Arabian Desert--and above,\nsomewhere between us and the stars, soared the floating island of\nmadness.\n\n\"They believed I was mad,\" said Brice as we climbed back into the\nplane. \"I watched Fraser. I spied on the men. There were about thirty\nup there, and finally I saw where they regulated those lamps. The rest\nwas easy--all except the minute when I found Fraser kneeling beside\nthat trap-door slicing the cables. For a second I thought it was all\nup.\"\n\n\"You got us just in time,\" I muttered. But you can't be grateful with\nan Englishman. They won't stand for it.\n\n\"Oh, bosh,\" Brice murmured, as the plane swung its nose toward that\nfar distance that was home. \"Well, it's all over--but it's a story\nthat can never be told. The fate of Mad Fraser will have to remain a\nmystery--for no one would believe us if we told them!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Floating Island of Madness, by Jason Kirby\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FLOATING ISLAND OF MADNESS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 29421-8.txt or 29421-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/4/2/29421/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
