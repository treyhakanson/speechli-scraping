SMITH\n\n                      Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                      Galaxy Magazine April 1960.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n               What did Genetics and Hansen's Folly have\n                in common? Why, everything ... Genetics\n            was statistical and Hansen's Folly impossible!\n\n\nI\n\nThe living room reflected wealth, position, good taste. In size it was\na full ten feet by fourteen, with nearly an eight-foot ceiling. Light\nwas furnished by glow panels precisely balanced in color to produce\nlight's most flattering tint for the woman who sat in a delicate chair\nof authentic, golden-veined blackwood.\n\nThe chair itself must have cost a fortune to ship from Tau Ceti Five.\nIt was an ostentation in the eyes of the visitor, who viewed it as\nevidence of a self-indulgent attitude that would certainly make his job\nmore difficult.\n\nThe air in the room was fresh and very faintly aromatic, pleasing. It\ncame draftlessly refreshed at a temperature of seventy-six degrees and\na relative humidity of fifty per cent and permitted the entry of no\nmore than one foreign particle (dust) per cubic foot.\n\nThe coffee table was another ostentation, but for a different reason\nthan the imported chair of blackwood. The coffee table was of\nmahogany--terrestrial mahogany--and therefore either antique, heirloom,\nor both, and in any combination of cases it was priceless. It gave\nthe visitor some dark pleasure to sit before it with his comparison\nmicroscope parked on the polished mahogany surface, with the ease of\none who always parked his tools on tables and stands made of treasure\nwoods.\n\nThere were four persons. Paul Hanford swirled brandy in a snifter\nwith a series of nervous gestures. Mrs. Hanford sat in the blackwood\nchair unhappily, despite the flattering glow of the wall-panels. Their\ndaughter, Gloria, sat in such a way as to distract the visitor by\npresenting a target that his eyes could not avoid. Try as he would, his\ngaze kept straying to the slender, exposed bare ankle and the delicate,\nhigh-arched foot visible beneath the hem of the girl's dress.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorman Ross, GSch, was the visitor, and he subvocalized his tenth\nself-indictment as he tore his gaze away from Gloria Hanford's ankle to\nlook into Paul Hanford's face. Ross was the Scholar of Genetics for the\nlocal division of the Department of Domestic Tranquility and he should\nhave known all about such things, but he obviously did not.\n\nHe said, \"You can hardly blame yourselves, you know,\" although he did\nnot really believe it.\n\n\"But what have we done wrong?\" asked Mrs. Hanford in a plaintive voice.\n\nScholar Ross shook his head and caught his gaze in mid-stray before it\nreturned all the way to that alluring ankle. \"Genetics, my dear Mrs.\nHanford, is a statistical science, not a precise science.\" He waved\nvaguely at the comparison microscope. \"There are your backgrounds for\nseven generations. No one--and I repeat, _no one_--could have foreseen\nthe issue of a headstrong, difficult offspring from the mating of\ncharacteristics such as these. I checked most carefully, most minutely,\njust to be certain that some obscure but important conflict had not\nbeen overlooked by the signing doctor. Doctors, however, do make\nmistakes.\"\n\nGloria Hanford dandled her calf provocatively and caused the hem of her\nskirt to rise another half-inch. The scholar's eyes swung, clung, and\nwere jerked away again.\n\n\"What's wrong with me, Scholar Ross?\" she asked in a throaty voice.\n\n\"You are headstrong, self-willed, wild, and--\" his voice failed because\nhe wanted to lash out at her for her brazen and deliberate display of\nher bare ankle; he struggled to find a drawing-room word for her that\nwould not wholly offend the hapless parents and ultimately came up\nwith--\"meretricious.\"\n\nGloria said, \"I'm all that just because I enjoy a little fun?\"\n\n\"You may call it fun to scare people to death by flying your aircar\nbelow roof level along the city streets, but the Department of Air\nTraffic says that it is both dangerous and illegal.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\"\n\nPaul Hanford said, \"Gloria, it isn't that you don't know better.\"\n\nMrs. Hanford said, \"Paul, how have we failed as parents?\"\n\nScholar Ross shook his head. \"You haven't failed. You can't help it if\nyour daughter is a throwback--\"\n\n\"Throwback!\" exclaimed Gloria.\n\n\"--to an earlier, more violent age when uncontrolled groups of\nheadstrong youths formed gangs of New York and conducted open warfare\nupon one another for the control of Tammany Hall. Those wild days were\nthe result of unregistered, unrestricted, and uncontrolled matings.\nSince no attempt was made to prevent the unfit from mating with the\nunfit, there were many generations of wild ones--troublemakers. It is\nnot surprising that, with such a human heritage, an occasional wild one\nis born today.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe scholar took another surreptitious (he hoped) glance at the bare\nankle and said, \"No, you are not directly to blame. We know you\nwouldn't spawn a troublemaker willfully and maliciously. It's just\nan unfortunate accident. You must not despair over the past--but you\n_must_ spend your efforts to calm the troubled future.\"\n\n\"What should we do, Scholar Ross?\" asked Paul Hanford.\n\n\"I have to speak bluntly. Perhaps you'd prefer the ladies to leave.\"\n\n\"I'll not go,\" said Mrs. Hanford firmly, and Gloria added, \"I'm not\ngoing to let you talk about me behind my back!\"\n\n\"Very well. As Scholar of Genetics, I am head of the local Division\nof Domestic Tranquility. I would prefer to keep my district calm and\npeaceful, without the attention of the punitive authorities, and I'm\nsure you'd all prefer this, too.\"\n\n\"Absolutely!\" said Paul Hanford.\n\n\"Now, then,\" said Scholar Ross, \"for the immediate problem, we'll\nprescribe fifty milligrams of dociline, one tablet to be taken each\nnight before retiring. This will place our young lady's frame of mind\nin a receptive mood to suggestions of gentler pursuits. As soon as\npossible, Mr. Hanford, subscribe to _Music To Live By_ and have them\npipe in Program G-252 every evening, starting shortly after dinnertime\nand signing off shortly after breakfast. Your daughter's dinnertime and\nbreakfast I mean, and the outlet should be in her bedroom. It is not\nmandatory that she heed the program material all the time, but it must\nbe available to set her moods. Finally, upon awakening, a twenty-five\nmilligram tablet of nitrolabe will lower the patient's capacity for\nanticipating excitement during the day.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment thoughtfully, and added as if it were an\naside, \"I'd not go so far as to suggest that you--her parents--make a\nconscious effort to avoid listening to periods of Program G-252, but\nI'd definitely warn you not to fall into the habit of listening to it.\"\n\nHe eyed the ceiling thoughtfully, then consulted his notebook. \"Come\nto think of it, I'll also give you a prescription for Program X-870\nwhich you can use or not as you desire. Have this one piped into your\nbedroom, Mrs. Hanford, and try to strike a somewhat reasonable balance.\nSay no greater imbalance than about two of one to one of the other\nand if you, Mr. Hanford, spend any time listening to your daughter's\nprogram material, you should also counteract its effect by listening to\nan equal time of the program prescribed for Mrs. Hanford.\"\n\nHe turned back to Gloria and shook his head.\n\nShe smiled archly at him and asked, \"Now what's wrong?\"\n\n\"You,\" he told her bluntly. \"If this delinquency weren't a mental\ndisorder, I'd prescribe a ten milligram dose of micrograine to be taken\nat the first quickening of the pulse prior to excitement. I don't\nsuppose you really regret your wildness, though, do you, Miss Hanford?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe shook her head. \"No, and I don't really enjoy the whole program\nyou've laid out for me.\"\n\n\"I'd hardly expect anybody to approve of a program that is calculated\nto change their entire personality and character,\" said Scholar Ross.\n\"But a bit of common logic will convince you that it is the better\nthing. Miss Hanford, you've simply _got_ to conform.\"\n\n\"Why?\" she demanded.\n\n\"We live in a free world, Miss Hanford, but it is a freedom diluted by\nour responsibility to our fellow-man. The density of population here on\nEarth is too high to permit rowdy behavior. Laws are not passed simply\nto curtail a man's freedom. They are passed to protect the innocent\nbystander--who is minding his own business--from the unruly, headstrong\ncharacter who doesn't see anything wrong in disposing of empty beer\nbottles by dropping them out of his apartment window, and justifying\nhis behavior by pointing out that it is a hundred-yard walk down the\ncorridor to the trash chute. When we live so close together that no one\ncan raise his voice in anger without disturbing his neighbor, then we\nhave the right to pass laws against such a display of temper. It works\nboth ways, Miss Hanford. By requiring people to behave themselves, we\nultimately arrive at a social culture in which no one conducts himself\nin such a way as to anger his neighbor into violence. Have I made\nmyself clear?\"\n\n\"In other words,\" said Gloria, \"if it's fun, hurry up and pass a law\nagainst it!\"\n\n\"Well, hardly that--\" the scholar began.\n\n\"Tell me,\" she interrupted. \"How long am I going to be on this\npill-and-lullaby diet?\"\n\n\"It may be for a long time. In severe cases, it is for the rest of the\npatient's life. On the other hand, we have quite a bit of evidence\nthat your urge to excitement may dwindle with maturity. Oh, we do not\npropose to make a pariah out of you. Marriage and motherhood have\nsettling effects, too.\"\n\n\"My baby--!\" cried Mrs. Hanford.\n\n\"Your baby,\" commented Paul Hanford in a very dry voice, \"is a college\ngraduate, twenty years old.\"\n\n\"Nobody's asked my opinion,\" complained Gloria, swinging her leg and\nhiking the hem of her skirt another half-inch above the slender ankle.\n\n\"Nobody will. However, Miss Hanford, I shall place your card in the\n'eligible' file and have your characteristics checked. I'm sure that\nwe can find a man who will be acceptable to you--and also to the\ndepartment of Domestic Tranquility.\"\n\n\"Humph!\"\n\n\"Sneer if you will, Miss Hanford. But marriage and motherhood have\ntaken the 'hell' out of a lot of hell-raisers in the past.\"\n\n\nII\n\nJunior Spaceman Howard Reed entered the commandant's office eagerly and\nbriskly. His salute was snappy as he announced himself.\n\nCommander Breckenridge looked up at the young spaceman without\nexpression, nodded curtly, and then looked down at the pile of papers\nneatly stacked in the center of his desk. Without saying a word, the\ncommander fingered down through the pile until he came to a thin sheaf\nof papers stapled together. This file he withdrew, placed atop the\nstack, and then he proceeded to read every word of every page as if he\nwere refreshing his memory about some minor incident that had become\nimportant only because of the upper-level annoyance it had caused.\n\nWhen he finished, he looked up and said coldly, \"I presume you know why\nyou're here, Mr. Reed?\"\n\n\"I can guess, sir--because of my technical suggestion.\"\n\n\"You are correct.\"\n\n\"And it's been accepted?\" cried the junior spaceman eagerly.\n\n\"It has not!\" snapped the superior officer. \"In fact--\"\n\n\"But, sir, I don't understand--\"\n\n\"Silence!\" said Commander Breckenridge. Almost automatically, his right\nhand slipped the top drawer open to expose the vial of tri-colored\ncapsules. His hand stopped short of them, dangling into the drawer\nfrom the wrist resting on the edge. He looked down at the pills and\nseemed to be debating whether it would be better to conduct this\npainful interview as gentlemen should, or to let his righteous anger\nshow.\n\n\"Mr. Reed,\" he said heavily, \"your aptitudes and qualifications\nwere reviewed most carefully by the Bureau of Personnel, and their\nconsidered judgment caused your replacement here, in the Bureau of\nOperations. You were _not_--and I repeat, _not_--placed in the Bureau\nof Research. Is this clear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. But--\"\n\n\"Mr. Reed, I cannot object to the provisions in the Regulations whereby\nencouragement is given both the officers and men to proffer suggestions\nfor the betterment of the Service. However, a shoe-maker should stick\nto his last. The benefit of this program becomes a detriment when any\nofficer or man tries to invade other departments. This works both ways,\nMr. Reed. There is not an officer in the whole Bureau of Research who\ncan tell me a single thing about organizing my Bureau of Operations.\nConversely, I would be completely stunned if any Operations officer\nwere to come up with something that hasn't been known to the Bureau of\nResearch for years.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I see your point, sir. But if the Bureau of Research has\nknown about my suggestion for years, why isn't it being used?\"\n\n\"Because, Mr. Reed, it will not work!\"\n\n\"But, sir, it's _got_ to work!\"\n\n\"And you feel so firmly convinced of this that you had the temerity to\nbypass my office?\"\n\n\"Sir, you yourself make a point of professing to know absolutely\nnothing about scientific matters.\"\n\n\"All right, we'll table this angle for a few minutes. Just what makes\nthis notion of yours so important, Mr. Reed?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Sir,\" said Reed, \"the maximum range for our most efficient spacecraft\nis only a bit over seventeen light-years to the point of no return. My\nsuggestion deals with a means of extending that range a hundred times.\nPerhaps more. If it were my decision, sir, anything that even hinted at\nextending the cruising range would receive a maximum-urgency priority.\"\n\n\"In other words, you feel that anything we can do to extend our\noperations is the most important thing in the whole Space Service?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, perhaps not _the_ most important, but--\"\n\n\"Your modesty is gratifying. I presume this modesty would prevent you\nfrom accepting any more than the Letter of Commendation from the Office\nof the Secretary?\"\n\n\"I don't understand, sir.\"\n\n\"You don't? Mr. Reed, was your desire to improve the efficiency of\nOperations a simple desire to improve the Service--or did you hope that\nthis brilliant suggestion would, perhaps, provide you with a better\nassignment?\"\n\n\"I still do not understand.\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't? Mr. Reed, why did you join the Space Service in the\nfirst place?\"\n\n\"Because, sir, I hoped that I could be instrumental in helping mankind\nto spread across the Galaxy.\"\n\n\"Mr. Reed, have you sand in your shoes?\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\nThe commander sighed. \"You hoped to go along on the voyage, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I did have a hope that I'd become a real spaceman.\"\n\n\"And you're disappointed?\"\n\nHoward Reed's face was wistful, torn between a desire to confide in his\ncommanding officer and the fear of saying what he knew to be a sharp\ncriticism of the Space Service.\n\nThen Reed realized that he was in a bad pinch anyway, and so he said,\n\"Sir, I'm commissioned as a junior spaceman, but in three years I've\nonly made one short test flight--and only to Luna! I am competent to\npilot--or at least that's what the flight simulators say in my checkout\ntests. I'm a junior spaceman--yet every time I apply for active space\nduty, I'm refused! Three years I've spent in the Service, sir, solving\ntheoretical and hypothetical problems in space operations. But aside\nfrom one test flight to the Moon, I have yet to set a foot inside of a\nspacecraft, let alone stand on the soil of another world!\"\n\n\"You must learn patience, Mr. Reed.\"\n\n\"_Patience_, sir? Look, sir, I took this sedentary duty until I'd had\nit up to here, and then I began to pry into the question of why we have\na Space Force, complete with spacecraft, and still do so little space\ntraveling. I found out. We're limited to a maximum range of seventeen\nlight-years to the point of no return. Even a trip to Eden, Tau Ceti,\nour nearest colony, is eleven-point-eight light-years, and that takes\nprodigious power.\"\n\n\"Granted,\" said the commander.\n\n\"But now, sir, if we could increase our range by one hundred times,\nthis does not necessarily mean that we must actually power the\nspacecraft for that point of no return. It also means that we could\ncharge the ship with one one-hundredth of its former banks for the\nshort trip to Eden, Tau Ceti--which would leave a _fantastic_ amount\nof storage and cargo and passenger space. Sir, we could start real\ncommerce!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCommander Breckenridge gave no reaction.\n\n\"And you hoped to be among them.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir! As a kid, I read about mankind's first exploration of space\ntwo hundred years ago, sir. Of course, I couldn't hope to set foot on a\nnew planet, since every possible planet within the seventeen-light-year\nrange has been looked over. But I wanted to see space myself, sir--and\nI did hope that I might extend Man's frontier beyond our rather small\nlimit.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can understand the impatience of youth,\" said Commander\nBreckenridge. \"For that, I can forgive you. But for trying to do the\nother man's job, I cannot.\"\n\n\"Sir, you're as much as saying that no one can have a good technical\nidea but the technical people at the Bureau of Research.\"\n\nIn answer, the commander flipped over several pages of the file. He\nsaid: \"Mister Reed, this is what resulted in your abortive attempt to\ngain a scientific ear instead of forwarding your suggestion through the\nstandard channels. I'm going to quote some pertinent parts of a letter\nfrom Commander Briggs, head of the Bureau of Research. Listen:\n\n\"--young genius has rediscovered the line of mathematical argument\nknown here at Research as 'Hansen's Folly' because it was first\nexploited by young Spaceman Hansen about a hundred and fifty years\nago. Hansen's Folly is probably to be expected of a young, ambitious\nyoung officer with stars in his eyes. I'd be inclined to congratulate\nhim--if it weren't for the fact that Hansen's Folly turns up with such\nregularity that we here at Research hold a regular pool against its\nnext rediscovery. You'll be happy to know that you, your young genius,\nand your department have 'won' for me the great honor (?) of buying\ndinner for the crew at the Officers Club on Saturday next.\n\n\"Don't be too hard on young Reed; the rediscovery of Hansen's Folly\ntakes a rather bright mind. However, Breck, I _will_ congratulate your\nbright young man if he can--without any further clue--go back over his\nown mathematics and locate the flaw. I'll--\"\n\n\"There's more of this, but it isn't germane,\" said Breckenridge\nquietly. \"This is enough.\"\n\n\"Enough, sir?\" repeated Reed blankly.\n\n\"Enough to let you know what goes on. Now, Mr. Reed, you've committed\nnothing but a brash act of bad taste in bypassing the standard\nchannels. Such an indiscretion demands some form of punishment, but\nif I were to attempt to outline punishment officially, it would be\nunfortunately easy for some legal eagle to point out that your behavior\nwas, to the best of your knowledge, intended for the betterment of\nthe Service. And furthermore that I was wreaking vengeance upon your\nhapless soul for having made my name the brunt of jokes at the Officers\nClub.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir.\"\n\n\"Being sorry is not enough, Mr. Reed. But I have a plan that will\ngratify everybody concerned. You want to become an active spaceman?\nVery well, your next tour of duty will be at the Space Force Station\non the planet Eden, Tau Ceti. It will terminate when you have finally\nsucceeded in locating the flaw in Hansen's Folly and can show the error\nto the satisfaction of Commander Briggs. Have I made myself clear, Mr.\nReed?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, and thank you, sir. You're really doing me a favor, sir.\"\n\n\"Mr. Reed, despite the age-old platitude, it is wise to look the gift\nhorse in the mouth, at least before saying thanks.\"\n\n\nIII\n\nScholar Norman Ross smiled at his host's statement. \"Yes, indeed, Mr.\nHarrison! Arranging these things so that we can maintain the Norm is\noften a delicate and arduous task. There are restrictions, and there\nare many variables involved, the most sensitive of which are the\nfeelings of the people involved.\"\n\n\"Your job must call for the ultimate in diplomacy,\" said Mrs. Harrison.\n\nTo his host's wife, Scholar Ross nodded. \"Yet,\" he said as an\nafterthought, \"of even greater value is a high regard for the perfect\ntruth. This includes the self-discipline of admitting it when one has\nbeen wrong, and being able to state precisely how, where, why, and,\nmost important, to what degree.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said his hostess.\n\n\"Mrs. Harrison, let's consider Bertram.\"\n\nShe cast a glance at her son. In an earlier age, he would have been\ncalled \"indolent.\" During dinner, Bertram had employed the correct\nfork, plied his knife properly, conversed with his partners on both\nsides--yet she knew something was wrong.\n\n\"Bertram,\" she said, \"haven't you been forgetting your pills?\"\n\n\"Sorry, Mother,\" replied the young man tonelessly.\n\nBertram arose and left, and Scholar Ross said, \"This is what I mean,\nMrs. Harrison. Genetics is not a precise science; it is statistical. We\ncan consider highly favorable the mating of two well-balanced people,\nand we can predict that this union will produce well-balanced children.\nUnfortunately we cannot guarantee the desired results. Hence we have\nanomalies such as Bertram, whose problem is simply a lack of drive. Now\nthis is no fault of yours, Mrs. Harrison, nor of yours, Mr. Harrison.\nIt may be the fault of Genetics, but if it is our 'fault,' then the\nfault lies in the lack of total knowledge; but not in the misuse, or\nlack of use, of what knowledge we do already have.\"\n\n\"I see what you mean, Scholar Ross.\"\n\n\"You'll also see the opposite when the Hanfords arrive. Here we have\nparents as stable as you two. You'll pardon me if I say that if all\nfour of your characteristic cards were dropped at once and I had been\nexpected to render a considered opinion as to their most favorable\nmating combination, I could render no preference, so equal are you.\nHowever, your union has produced Bertram. Conversely, their mating has\nproduced a girl who is wild, headstrong, willful.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBertram returned, seated himself quietly, and when Scholar Ross stopped\ntalking, Bertram said apologetically, \"I took a double dose, Mother.\"\n\n\"Is that all right?\" she asked Scholar Ross.\n\n\"Probably won't do any harm,\" he said.\n\nMr. Harrison cleared his throat. \"I'm not sure that I approve of\nBertram marrying a headstrong girl, Scholar Ross.\"\n\nMrs. Harrison said, \"William, you know it's best.\"\n\n\"For Bertram?\"\n\n\"Now here,\" said Scholar Ross, \"we must cease considering the\nwelfare of the individual alone and start thinking of him as a part\nof an integrated society. No man is an island, Mr. Harrison. In a\nless advanced culture, Bertram would have been permitted to meet\ncontemporary personalities. Perhaps might have met someone who--as he\ndoes--lacks drive and initiative, and the result would have been a\nfamily of dull children. Had he been unlucky enough to marry a woman\nwith drive and ambition, their children might have been normal, but the\nentire home life would have been an emotional battlefield. And that--\"\n\n\"Isn't that what you're about to achieve?\" asked Mr. Harrison.\n\n\"Not at all. We shall achieve the normal, happy children who will\nundoubtedly grow into fine, stable adults. To gain this end, of\ncourse, their home life must be happy and tranquil. We'll prescribe\nfor them--allowing for the emotional change that results from marriage\nand--\"\n\nThe doorbell interrupted the scholar's explanation. \"Allow me,\" he\nsaid, rising and heading for the apartment door. The Harrisons followed\nhim at a slight distance. It was the Hanfords.\n\nThere was the full round robin of introductions and small talk: \"You\nhad no trouble?\" \"No, the intercity beacon was running clear--\" \"Lovely\napartment, Mrs. Harrison.\" \"Mrs. Hanford, here in Philadelphia we feel\nthat we're almost in the suburbs.\" \"Got a treat for you, Hanford--been\nsaving a bottle of natural bourbon!\" \"That'll be a treat, all right!\"\n\"This is a real event. Scholar Ross.\" \"You know, Mrs. Hanford, the\nvidphone hardly does you justice!\" \"Why, thank you!\"\n\n\"Miss Hanford, may I present Bertram Harrison?\" \"How do you do?\" \"I do\nas I please. What's your excuse?\" \"Huh?\" \"_Now, Gloria!_\" \"Bertram,\nshow Gloria the flower room. Go on, now!\"\n\nScholar Ross watched the young couple walk through a French door to an\noutside terrace. He turned to Harrison and said, \"Everything set?\"\n\nHarrison nodded. \"Had a little trouble with the Music people till I\nused your priority. They said they'd have Program R-147 piped into the\nflower room. Frankly, I think R-215 is better.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nScholar Ross laughed gently. \"Probably happy association.\"\n\n\"Wife and I still have it piped in for our anniversary,\" Mr. Harrison\nadmitted.\n\n\"Good for you! But R-215 is for normal, happily well-balanced young\npeople who'd probably fall in love without it. R-147 is sure-fire for\nemotional opposites.\"\n\n\"Well, we finally got the program piped in, so what do we do now?\"\n\nScholar Ross smiled quietly. \"We wait. We get acquainted, because there\nis a very high probability that you two families will be united through\nthe marriage of your children. Then I shall enter a new file in the\nGenetics Bureau of the Department of Domestic Tranquility. We shall\nwatch through the years as your grandchildren grow, and make periodic\nchecks, and thereby advance mankind's knowledge of genetics.\"\n\n\"Doesn't this sort of master-minding ever give you a God complex?\"\nasked Mr. Hanford.\n\n\"Not at all. Were I God, I'm sure I could arrange things a lot better.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"By Man's own laws, we are prevented from doing active genetic research\non the human race. We apply what happens to mice and fruit flies\nto the human family tree. We've known for centuries how to breed\nblue-eyed or brown-eyed people, or, if we wanted, we could make the\nrace predominantly fat or thin, tall or short. However, our main aim is\nnot the ultimate purity of any physical characteristic. Our goal is to\nproduce a stable, happy people by eliminating the lethargic personality\nbelow and the excitable types above.\"\n\nThe scholar thought for a moment, and then, remembering Bertram's error\nin forgetting to take his go-pills, said, \"But we are blocked by law.\nI can prescribe medication and therapy, but I have no power to force\nthe patient to take the treatment. This is a most difficult problem,\nbelieve me.\"\n\n\"In what way?\" asked Mrs. Harrison with some interest.\n\n\"The lethargic types are very apt to forget, or to dismiss the\nmedication or the therapy as too much trouble. The overactive type\nis more likely to be water skiing on Lake Superior than sitting and\nlistening to the tranquilizing strains of prescribed music, and the\nmedication dumped down the drain instead of taken.\"\n\n\"You do have your problems, don't you?\" said Mrs. Hanford\nsympathetically.\n\n\"Ah, yes. But our greatest problem is the overactive young female.\nYoung males can be siphoned off in one way or another--work to be done\nthat, unfortunately, females, can't also do.\" Scholar Ross smiled at\nMr. and Mrs. Harrison. \"So we actually are grateful for the lethargic\ntypes.

They did not get all the way to the French\ndoors, for Gloria Hanford came stamping in. Her eyes were bright, and\nshe was dusting one palm with the other.\n\n\"What--?\"\n\nGloria snapped, \"Someone been feeding that oaf red meat?\"\n\n\"But what _happened_?\" asked Mr. Harrison.\n\n\"Oh, I could stand the big dummy acting as if he'd never been alone\nwith a girl before in all his life. But to _ask_ me for a kiss!\"\n\n\"Is that what caused the eruption?\" said Scholar Ross.\n\n\"When he _asked_ me for a kiss, I told him that I was saving my kisses\nfor a _man_!\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then he decided that I meant a man big enough to wrestle.\" Gloria\nlaughed and then looked thoughtful.\n\n\"What's so funny--and not so funny now?\"\n\n\"I just realized that _I like men_!\"\n\n\"But Bertram?\"\n\n\"Darned if it isn't the first time I've ever resented being pawed,\"\nsaid Gloria in a matter-of-fact tone, as if it were her hair-do rather\nthan her virtue that was the subject of discussion. \"So I grabbed\na hand, hung the arm over my shoulder with the inside upward, and\nhip-tossed the big oaf over the railing into that silly little fish\npond.\"\n\n\"Gloria!\" exploded her mother.\n\n\"Poor Bertram!\" exclaimed his mother.\n\nScholar Ross sighed. \"These things often go awry at first. Bertram\nshouldn't have taken a double dose of his medication. And I'd guess\nthat Gloria hasn't been meticulous about hers, either. Now--\"\n\nHe was interrupted by the arrival of Bertram Harrison, who looked as if\nhe'd just waded home across a mud flat at low tide. He stepped toward\nGloria purposefully; the girl crouched in a judo position and said,\n\"Want some more? Come and get it!\"\n\n\"Now wait a moment,\" said Scholar Ross. \"Gloria, where did you ever\nlearn such brutal, belligerent tactics?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGloria faced him, but kept one eye on Bertram. \"Out of a book--where\nelse in this calm old world?\"\n\nThe scholar said, \"You see, Miss Hanford, the results of your\noutrageous behavior? You've committed an act of physical violence.\nYou've--\"\n\nThe girl gave one sharp bark of laughter. \"Who started it with whose\ncaveman technique?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Scholar Ross to the four parents, \"that this meeting\nshould be resumed at a later date. Bertram must _not_ overdose himself\nin a misguided effort to make up for omitted medication. Gloria must\n_not_ avoid hers--and, Mrs. Hanford, you'll not only have to watch\nclosely to see that she does take her pills; you'll also have to make\nsure that Gloria doesn't counteract them by surreptitiously acquiring\nsome agitators to neutralize the tranquilizers.\"\n\n\"And suppose I call the whole thing off?\" demanded Gloria. \"Suppose I\ndon't agree to share bed and board with this souped-up sardine?\"\n\nThe room grew quieter until the background sounds were gone and from\nthe patio came the faint, sweet strains of romantic music: Program\nR-147.\n\nFinally Scholar Ross said, \"Miss Hanford, we cannot force you to do\nanything, but we can make your life extremely uncomfortable if you\ndo not comply with what we believe to be best for society. You will\nfind--if you care to look it up--that there is a drastic shortage of\neligible young women on the planet Eden, Tau Ceti.\"\n\n\"You mean--migrate--to the _colony_?\"\n\n\"I mean just that.\"\n\nGloria Hanford's face went white. She understood that if Scholar Ross\ndecreed Eden, Tau Ceti, for her, then she would end up on Eden, Tau\nCeti, and it made no difference whether by force, coercion, or gentle\npersuasion.\n\nMrs. Hanford took a step forward and opened her mouth to speak. But\nbefore she could protest, her husband put out a hand and stopped her.\nHis act was an admission that not money, position, nor logic would\noverrule such a decision.\n\n\"Eden, Tau Ceti,\" breathed Gloria. She turned and faced Bertram\nHarrison. \"Junior,\" she said in a dry, strained voice, \"if you'll wear\nmittens and handcuffs, let's go back in the garden and get acquainted.\"\n\nHer father exhaled a full breath.\n\nMr. Harrison tapped him on the shoulder. \"How about a sample of that\nbottle of natural bourbon?\" he suggested.\n\n\"Not,\" Mrs. Hanford said shakily, \"without me!\"\n\n\nIV\n\nMan's first sally across the gulf of interstellar space had been more\nfruitful than his first fumbling exploration of the Solar System by a\nscore of one to nothing. Of all the celestial real estate that orbits\naround old Sol, only the Earth will support life--at least as we know\nit. Survival elsewhere depends upon taking enough of Earth environment\nalong to last of the trip. From the scientific standpoint, the first\nexploration of space was a brilliant operation, but before finding a\nplace to accept the teeming millions of Earth's exploding population,\nthe patient nearly died. For it was a quarter of a century until\nMurray, Langdon, and Hanover cracked the Einstein barrier.\n\nBy careful design, and then by counting the last gram and striking a\nmathematically adjusted balance between power bank and crew space, the\nrange of a spacecraft was found to be slightly more than seventeen\nlight-years to the point of no return.\n\nWithin seventeen light-years of Sol, there are forty-one other stars.\n\nOf these forty-one stars, three are triple-sun systems, and twelve are\ndoubles, which eliminates fifteen of them. Of the remaining twenty-six\nsingle stars, one is the blinding-blue giant Altair, two are white\ndwarf stars, and nineteen of them are the faint red dwarf stars of\nSpectral Class M, and that eliminates all but four of the original\nforty-one. Of this remaining four, Epsilon Eridani, Epsilon Indi, and\nGroombridge 1618 fall into the orange Spectral Class K, which is not\ntoo far away from Sol's Spectral Class G. But K is only close; it is\nno bull's eye when the combination of all the factors must add up to\nproduce a planetary environment that will support human life.\n\nAnd so, having eliminated forty out of the forty-one stars in Sol's\nneighborhood, only Tau Ceti remains. Tau Ceti is also a Spectral\nClass G star and therefore Tau Ceti was voted the star most likely to\nsucceed, long before Man had the foggiest notion of how to cross the\nlight-years, long before instruments sensitive enough to ascertain that\nTau Ceti possessed a planetary system were developed.\n\nTau Ceti's planetary system can be used as an example of the brilliance\nof logic and reasoning. The second planet in the family of Tau Ceti is\nthe planet Eden.\n\nEden supports life.\n\nOr perhaps it is more proper to say that Eden's environment permits\nlife to support itself. Voltaire, through the mouths of his characters\nCandide and Pangloss, had a lot to say about Earth being the best of\nall possible worlds, both pro and con. He had never been to Eden. Eden\nwas christened by the rules of real estate that dictate that a housing\ndevelopment situated on a tree-bald plain in central Kansas shall be\ncalled \"Sylvan Heights.\"\n\n\nV\n\nJunior Spaceman Howard Reed went through a brief period of excitement\nand then settled down to boredom. The excitement came from his first\nexperience in space travel, and the thrill of standing on soil almost\ntwelve light-years from home base. This thrill faded as soon as he\ndiscovered that the people on Eden, Tau Ceti, were far too busy to be\nbothered with the reactions of a junior spaceman.\n\nIf his duties had been demanding, Reed might have gone on for some time\nwithout becoming bored. But as a junior officer in the Space Service,\nReed had no roots, no property, no basic interests on Eden.\n\nThe Space Service had been born out of interservice rivalry during a\ntense period of international competition. There had been a strong\nupsurge during the early years of the initial interstellar exploration.\nThe leaders of the Space Service were quite willing to featherbed\nthemselves into permanent positions of high authority. They discovered\nthe best method lay in exploiting every method of scaring the public\nwith the bogey of meeting some warlike culture \"Out There.\" Then the\nyears passed with neither sight nor evidence of any other form of life\nbut Man and the creatures he carried with him. The Space Service found\nitself with little to do.\n\nIt did not stop the clamor for money, men and materiel. But the job of\nthe Space Service was not hunting space pirates. The only place where\nthe power banks of a spacecraft could be restored was in the hands\nof the Space Service itself, and it was an installation vast enough\nto tax the wealth and ingenuity of a whole continent to create. The\njob was not fighting interstellar wars with fierce, super-intelligent\ninterstellar aliens with a taste for human flesh--not, at least, until\nhuman and alien met.\n\nSo, in a desultory manner, the Space Service maintained a perimeter\nof lookout and detection stations that could have been completely\nautomated ... if it hadn't been that there were more Space Service\nPersonnel than the Service could find work for.\n\nThe whole situation gave Junior Spaceman Howard Reed a lot of time to\nthink.\n\nThe culture of Eden, Tau Ceti, completed the process.\n\nEden used old-fashioned telephones because its people were too\nwidespread across the face of the planet to make the use of the\nvidphone practical. Radio broadcasting was maintained by the government\nas a public service information agency. It had to be. There were not\ncommercial enterprises enough to support radio broadcasting on a\nprofit-making basis. For there simply were not enough people. And if\nsimple radio broadcasting could not be supported, there was not yet\nroom for even the old flat-faced television, much less trivideo.\n\nTheirs was a culture in a mixed state. They had the know-how for a\nhighly technical, closely-integrated urban civilization, but lacked the\nhardware necessary to construct it. They were an aircar people, but\nthey used horses. Horses can be raised. Aircars have to be fabricated.\nIt would not have been prohibitive to trans-ship the basic tools and\ndies for aircar assembly from Earth, Sol, to Eden, Tau Ceti. But it\nwould have been economic suicide to attempt to keep the voracious maw\nof an automated assembly plant satiated with raw material shipped from\nhome base. And then, one week's run would have saturated the Tau Ceti\nmarket. They were a people who played their own musical instruments\nbecause they were faced with the very odd economic fact that the\nfirst phonograph record from the die costs five thousand dollars.\nNobody makes a dime until fifty thousand of its brothers are sold. The\npopulation to buy fifty thousand did not exist.\n\nIn simple fact, Eden, Tau Ceti, was far from a flourishing colony.\nIt was a classic example of the simple economic truth that a fully\nintegrated mechanistic society can not be supported by a sparsely\npopulated region.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAmbition has many origins. The urge to return home became a drive. The\nresult was Junior Spaceman Howard Reed's complete preoccupation with\nthe mathematics known as Hansen's Folly.\n\nAs the months went by he exhausted his original knowledge. He took to\nthe library, to the local schools, and to self-study to improve his\ngrasp. He approached the basic mathematics of the space drive from\nseveral different angles, even going back to the old original Einstein\nEquations and learning their fault in the hope that this study might\npoint the way.\n\nThen, as the months began to grow into the close of his first year,\nReed took advantage of the casually informal operation at the Space\nService Base. He began to experiment with hardware on the theory that\nhe would have a better grasp of the problem if he tried some empirical\nwork as well as the academic approach.\n\nJunior Spaceman Howard Reed had been on Eden, Tau Ceti, for eighteen\nterrestrial months before his superior officer, making a tour of\ninspection, opened the office reserved for him at the Administration\nBuilding. On the eighth day of his visit, Commander Breckenridge\nsummoned the junior spaceman to his office. He asked, \"Mr. Reed, have\nyou been successful in solving the flaw in Hansen's Folly?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, not exactly.\"\n\n\"Have you improved your grasp of the facts of life?\"\n\n\"Sir? I don't quite understand.\"\n\n\"You don't? Well, perhaps you need some help. For instance, Mr. Reed,\ncan you give me an estimate of the useful land area of Eden, Tau Ceti?\"\n\n\"Sir, the total land area is about fifty million square miles. Perhaps\nabout half of that is useful, or could be.\"\n\n\"Ah. You said 'could be'. Why, Mr. Reed?\"\n\n\"Let's put it this way, sir. Whether a given acreage is useful often\ndepends upon how badly it is needed. For instance, a plot of wooded\nland might well be ignored for centuries by a sparsely populated\nagrarian culture who had a lot of open plain to cultivate. At a later\ndate, an increasing pressure of population might make it expedient and\nsensible to clear vast areas of tree stumps, boulders and all sorts of\nhazards.\"\n\n\"And here on Eden?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, at the present time the population of Eden is about a\nhundred thousand. Fertile plains are growing wild with weeds because\nthe land isn't needed yet. That is--er--\"\n\n\"That is what?\"\n\n\"Maybe I shouldn't have said 'wild with weeds' sir. After all, they\nhave been encouraged. I'm told that the atmosphere smelled a lot\nstronger when Man first arrived.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe commander sniffed and said, \"It's pretty strong right now.\"\n\n\"You don't notice it after a couple of months,\" said Reed.\n\n\"I don't propose to be here that long,\" said the commander curtly.\n\"Let's get back to your grasp of the overall picture.\" Commander\nBreckenridge leaned back in his chair and said, \"No doubt you were\nexposed to Early North American History. You will recall that there was\na strong pioneering drive in the human race that went on almost from\nthe date of the discovery of North America until the opening phases\nof the so-called 'Industrial Revolution'--that is, beginning of the\nelectro-mechanical era. Am I not correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Now, young man, what has become of this strong pioneering drive? How\ndid it ooze out of the human race? Where did it go, and why? Why are\nsix billion people living in crowded conditions on Earth, while here\nupon Eden, Tau Ceti, a mere hundred thousand people occupy--by your\nestimate--some twenty million square miles? Why haven't the crowded\nmillions of Earth clamored for all this extra space?\"\n\n\"Perhaps because space travel is so expensive.\"\n\n\"Only in terms of cash. To be sure, it might take practically\neverything that a man has to buy passage. I now ask you to estimate\nhow many men and their families sacrificed everything they had, packed\na few treasured possessions into a Conestoga wagon and headed for the\nWest.\"\n\n\"I have no way of knowing, sir.\"\n\n\"No, of course not. Let me tell you what happened. In that glorious\nphase of Early North America, men, women, and even their children\ntoiled from sunrise to sunset to scratch out their living. From the\ndawn of history, luxury and leisure belonged to the landed baron.\nSince wealth went with acreage, any man who could stake out a claim\nto acreage could also claim wealth. It was a matter of finding the\nunclaimed acreage first.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe commander leaned forward to press his point. \"Then came the\nindustrial revolution and the age of automation. Industrial slavery\nended in a clank of gears. Your little man no longer starved to death\nnor toiled twelve hours a day. The finest automobile that the wealthy\nman could buy was only three or four times as expensive as the car\ndriven by the average workman. Therefore the idea of staking out arable\nland as a means to wealth became less and less desirable. Automation\nhit the farm. The landed baron changed into the elected presiding\nofficer over a stock-secured corporation.\n\n\"Today,\" said the commander, \"the man who leaves his home to migrate\nis not abandoning squalor and sorrow in the hope of finding something\nbetter. He's leaving luxury, culture, and leisure. For what? For the\nprivilege of scrabbling for a bare existence. Now, Mr. Reed, are you\nbeginning to understand?\"\n\n\"I think so, sir.\"\n\n\"Good. Then you'll begin to revise your opinion as to the importance of\nextending the cruising range of our spacecraft.\"\n\nReed blinked, \"Sir?\"\n\n\"Be sensible, young man. A colony is a waste of effort unless it\nbecomes more than self-sufficient. Until Eden, Tau Ceti, has become\npopulated to the point where Eden can support her own highly technical\nculture, it is an economically unsound proposition.\" The commander\nglared at the young spaceman. \"Must I be blunt? Every effort must\nbe spent in raising the culture-level of Eden, Tau Ceti. That means\nincreasing the population, Mr. Reed, until the numbers are high enough\nto pay for industrialization. Once the cities of Eden, Tau Ceti,\noffer the culture opportunity of the cities of Earth, then we'll\nhave migration on a social level instead of the malcontents, rugged\nindividualists, and petty lawbreakers who've been given the alternative\nof migration instead of incarceration.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Reed, do you see what I'm driving at? It would be far wiser\nof you to spend your time enhancing the aspect of Eden, Tau Ceti, than\ntrying to figure out ways and means of getting to more distant stars\nand locating other distant planets--to which the human race wouldn't\nmigrate.\"\n\n\"But sir--\"\n\n\"Mr. Reed, I recognize in you the admirable spirit of adventure. But\nwe must remember that this same spirit that once drove men to land\non Earth's moon in a multi-stage chemical rocket was not enough to\nestablish a tax-paying colony there. Now, about this project of yours.\nYou say that you have not yet located the flaw in Hansen's Folly?\"\n\n\"No, sir, but--\"\n\n\"Mr. Reed, you realize that you'll stay here on Eden until you do?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, but--\"\n\n\"And the longer it takes you, the more ridicule will be directed at\nyou, at me, and the Bureau of Operations?\"\n\n\"But, sir--\"\n\n\"Mr. Reed, I'll also point out that there will be no promotion until\nyour assignment is complete.\"\n\n\"I'm aware of that sir, but--\"\n\n\"But what, Mr. Reed?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nReed said, \"Sir, may I speak without annoying you?\"\n\n\"If you've something to say, go ahead. I can hardly promise not to be\nannoyed before I hear what the subject is.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir. In trying to solve Hansen's Folly I engaged in some\nphysical experiment and measurement because I couldn't find any flaw in\nthe mathematical argument on the abstract scale. As you know, sir, one\nof the ways to find out why something won't work is to try it. It isn't\noften the easiest or the simplest, but it is often the only way.\"\n\n\"So go on. What happened?\"\n\n\"Sir, my hardware works. So far as I can see, sir, there is no flaw! I\nwas right!\"\n\n\"Commander Briggs of Research--\"\n\n\"Sir, there must be some mistake.\"\n\n\"Silence! I'm not through! Commander Briggs seems to know more about\nmy personnel than I do.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"First, he offered to bet me a dinner at the Officer's Club that you\nwouldn't locate the flaw in Hansen's Folly by the time I made this\ntour of inspection. Knowing that you'd probably have no other ambition\nthan to leave Eden, Tau Ceti, I snapped at this wager like a starving\ndog latching onto a piece of steak. I have lost, it would appear,\nwhich is only one dinner. But, Mr. Reed, when I accepted this wager,\nCommander Briggs compounded it by offering to bet me a dinner for the\nwhole Bureau of Research that after not finding the flaw by means of\nthe academic analysis, you'd resort to experiment in hardware. Knowing\nfull well that you'd not have the temerity to divert Service Material\nfor your own tinkering, I accepted that wager also. Then to top it off,\nBriggs added a bet of champagne and corsages for the officers' wives\nthat you'd complete your hardware and still not locate the flaw, and\nthat when I arrived you'd be firmly convinced that you'd proved your\npoint in theory and practice and that therefore you were right and the\nrest of the known universe was wrong.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe commander took a deep breath under which he swore gently but\nfeelingly. Then he went on: \"And so, Mr. Reed, I am going to be 'Guest\nof Dishonor' at the Officers' Club. I will, according to custom, be\nserved the plate of baked synthetic beans whilst my contemporary\nofficers and their wives partake of a gourmet's banquet of natural\nfoods.\"\n\n\"Sir, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Being sorry is hardly enough!\" The commander pawed through his\nattache case until he came to a file-folder which he looked through\nmeticulously for several minutes as if justifying a carefully\nconsidered opinion. Finally he made a lightly pencilled note on the\nmargin of one page and said, \"Lalande 25372!\"\n\nJunior Spaceman Howard Reed gasped and blurted, \"Flatbush, sir?\"\n\nCommander Breckenridge nodded curtly. \"You will man the perimeter\nalien-spacecraft detection station and the astrogation beacon distance\nand direction equipment located on Flatbush, Lalande 25372. And you\nwill stay there until you have Hansen's Folly completely solved. Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\nJunior Spaceman Howard Reed nodded unhappily.\n\nLalande 25372 was close to the maximum range, the seventeen-light-year\npoint of no return. Any enjoyment in knowing that he would have to be\ncommissioned one of the finer, more efficient little spacecraft in\norder to get there in the first place was completely wiped out in the\nknowledge that once there, it would have to stand inert awaiting his\nreturn, because there would be no power to spare on side trips. One did\nnot, with subatomic power, carry a spare can of fuel for emergency.\n\n\nVI\n\nMrs. Hanford opened the door and saw Scholar Ross. She smiled\nuncertainly at him as she invited him in. In the Hanford living room,\nin the presence of Mr. Hanford, the scholar of genetics looked around\ncautiously and questingly. Hanford said, \"Gloria is not here. She's\nout.\"\n\n\"Then I may speak openly.\"\n\n\"Of course. Is there some trouble--again?\"\n\n\"Frankly, I'm not certain,\" said the scholar of genetics slowly. \"I'd\nlike more information if you'd be so good as to help.\"\n\n\"Of course we'll help!\" exclaimed Mrs. Hanford. \"What's bothering you?\"\n\n\"How is your daughter getting on with Bertram Harrison?\"\n\n\"Why, I'd guess they're getting along about as well as any other young\npre-marriage couple. That's what the engagement period is for, isn't\nit? I mean, it's been that way historically.\"\n\n\"Yes, you're right,\" nodded Scholar Ross. \"Did they rent the usual\npre-marriage apartment?\"\n\n\"Oh yes. They were quite the conventional young lovers, Scholar Ross.\"\n\nThe man from the Department of Domestic Tranquility smiled. \"And you,\nof course, were the conventional parents of the affianced bride?\"\n\n\"Of course. We were so pleased that we could hardly wait for Twelfth\nNight.\"\n\n\"And during that visit, were the appointments of the apartment proper?\"\n\n\"Why, Scholar Ross!\"\n\n\"No, no, Mrs. Hanford, you misunderstand. I implied no moral question.\nI really meant to ask if you knew whether Gloria and Bertram each and\nseparately were properly continuing their therapy.\"\n\nMr. Hanford grunted. \"As parents of the affianced bride,\" he said,\n\"we're paying for it!\"\n\nMrs. Hanford blushed. \"I--er--snooped,\" she said.\n\nScholar Ross looked at Mrs. Hanford with an expression that indicated\nthat snooping was an entirely acceptable form of social behavior. \"And\nwhat did you find?\"\n\n\"Everything entirely right.\" Then she looked doubtful and bit her lower\nlip. \"Scholar Ross, I'm no authority in these matters. In Gloria's\nbathroom were the same-_looking_ kind of bottles and pills that we got\nwhen you prescribed, and when I turned on the speaker in her bedroom\nit sounded like the same kind of music as I'd heard in her bedroom when\nshe was living at home. It--frankly--depressed me.\"\n\n\"And Bertram's?\"\n\n\"I know less of his medication. But I did listen to his music outlet.\nIt removed the feeling of depression I'd gotten from Gloria's program\nmaterial.\"\n\n\"That's quite right. It sounds reasonable.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe blushed again and looked at her husband. \"Only one thing,\" she said\nvery slowly.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"I--er, hardly know how to put it. You see, when Gerald and I were\naffianced, neither one of us were undergoing any kind of corrective\ntherapy and so I don't know how these things work out.\"\n\n\"What are you driving at?\"\n\n\"Why, Scholar Ross, with neither of us undergoing corrective therapy,\nit didn't matter which one of the bedrooms we used.\"\n\nScholar Ross considered for a moment and then nodded. \"Of course,\" he\nsaid with an air of complete finality. \"That's it!\"\n\n\"What's it?\" asked Mr. Hanford.\n\n\"The situation becomes a simple matter of reduction to the law of\nmost-active reaction. Look,\" he said, \"we have one personality that\nrequires an environment of stimulation to bring him up to normal, and\nanother personality that requires a tranquil atmosphere to normal.\nPlace them both in the tranquilizing environment and he is driven\ndeeper into his lethargy, probably to the point of complete physical\nand intellectual torpor. Place them both in the stimulating atmosphere\nand he becomes normal while she goes into transports of sensuous\nexcitement. This explains it!\"\n\n\"Explains what?\" demanded Mr. Hanford.\n\n\"Her recent behavior. Or rather escapade.\"\n\nNone of them heard the gentle snick of the lock in the front door.\n\n\"Escapade?\" exclaimed Mrs. Hanford.\n\n\"We didn't know that she was in any trouble,\" said Mr. Hanford.\n\n\"That's just the point,\" said Scholar Ross. \"Your daughter has the\ninfuriating habit of indulging in outrageous behavior under the name of\nbrilliant intellectual accomplishment.\"\n\nGloria Hanford said, \"Why, thank you, sir!\"\n\nShe dropped the scholar a deep curtsey, displaying several inches of\nslender ankle.\n\n\"Gloria!\" demanded her mother. \"What have you been up to?\"\n\nGloria Hanford smiled at her mother in an elfin, yet superior manner.\n\"I am the affianced bride of Bertram Harrison,\" she said softly.\n\"Therefore my behavior, whether good, bad, or indifferent, is no\nlonger the problem of my parents.\"\n\nHer father said, \"Gloria, I happen to be big enough in both the\nphysical and intellectual departments to overrule both you and your\nhusband-to-be. So you'll answer your mother.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Gloria quietly, \"I've done nothing wrong.\"\n\nMr. Hanford said to Scholar Ross: \"What's your side of this?\"\n\nScholar Ross said, \"Last week the Westchester Young People's Club gave\na costume ball. The young ladies were to attend this affair adorned in\nthe authentic fashion of some period in the past, and a prize was to be\nawarded to the most novel, yet completely authentic costume.\"\n\n\"And,\" said Gloria with a smile, \"I won!\"\n\n\"Your daughter won because she has a talent for performing the most\nshocking deeds under a cloak of intellectual achievement.\"\n\n\"Do go on, Scholar Ross. What did Gloria do?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe scholar smiled wryly. \"Style and fashion ceased to be logical when\nclothing was designed for sly provocation rather than as a protection\nagainst a harsh environment,\" he said. \"We live in a mixed-up social\nworld. We encourage communal swimming and sun bathing in the nude--and\nyet after five o'clock it is considered shocking to display more than\nthe bare face and hands.\n\n\"So in order to combine the maximum shock-effect with the cloak of\nutter authenticity, Miss Hanford researched the styles and fashions\nuntil she located a brief period of a few scant months late in the\nTwentieth Century. Her costume consisted of a many-fold voluminous\nskirt of semi-transparent material that draped in graceful folds\nfrom waist to mid-calf. She was completely nude above the waist! To\nprove her point, she offered fashion stereos of the period from style\nmagazines.\"\n\nGloria chuckled. \"I might have researched back to the Old Testament,\"\nshe said.\n\nScholar Ross shook his head. \"As I say, her shocking behavior could not\nbe criticized. She could justify it according to the rules.\"\n\nMr. Hanford shook his head and asked, \"Gloria, what did Bertram think\nof all this?\"\n\n\"Bertram carried the style stereos,\" said Gloria. \"There wasn't any\npocket in my costume.\"\n\nAbruptly, Scholar Ross said, \"Miss Hanford, how are you and Bertram\ngetting along?\"\n\n\"As well as could be expected.\"\n\n\"Meaning what?\"\n\n\"Meaning that each of us lives our own life. Berty likes his sedentary,\ntorpid existence. In fact, he'd like to be more of a vegetable than\nhe is. It started with his taking my pills and that was all right, I\nguess. But when he started sleeping in my bedroom so that he could\nestivate under the tranquilizing music program you prescribed for me,\nthat was too much!\"\n\nScholar Ross looked unprecedentedly astonished. \"So?\" he demanded.\n\n\"What do you mean 'so'? What would any red blooded woman do? I moved\nout and into his bedroom, naturally.\"\n\n\"And then started taking his medication?\" asked Scholar Ross curtly.\n\n\"Natch!\"\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" exploded Scholar Ross. He eyed Gloria intently. \"How do\nyou manage to get Bertram awake far enough to attend things like your\ncostume ball?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well,\" she said with a smile, \"I am really strong enough to sling\na hundred and eighty-five pounds of loosely-stuffed sausage over my\nshoulder in a fireman's carry and tote the inert mass back to its own\nbedroom so that its own music will rouse it enough to reach for its\nbedside bottles of medication. Nature then takes its course until the\nawakening. Then he goes along with my desires--because he knows that if\nhe doesn't, I won't let him dive back into his complete inertia. It's\nvery simple. Of course, it isn't much fun.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nScholar Ross said, \"Gloria, do you intend to continue this sort of\nself-centered, artificial life after you and Bertram are married?\"\n\n\"I've given the future very little thought.\"\n\n\"You always have,\" said Scholar Ross unhappily. \"That's been a lot of\nyour trouble.\"\n\n\"So what am I supposed to do? Do you really expect me to marry that\nvegetable? I've got a life to lead too, you know. It may suit your\noverall program of genetics to breed a batch of normal children, but\nthe same Book of Laws grants me the right to seek my own level of\nhappiness.\"\n\n\"Granted--\"\n\n\"Well, scholar, I can tell you that my idea of happiness is not a\nhusband who comes into my bedroom walking like a somnambulist just\nbarely able to cross the room before collapsing like a loosely-packed\nsandbag.\"\n\n\"What you need,\" said Scholar Ross firmly, \"is a man who is strong\nenough to tell you what you're going to do.\"\n\n\"And where are you going to find one?\"\n\nScholar Ross turned from Gloria to her parents. \"Obviously,\" he said\nregretfully, \"this proposed marriage between your daughter and Bertram\nHarrison is not going to culminate in a happy union.\"\n\n\"Did you expect it to?\" asked Gloria.\n\n\"I had hopes. I can only propose a course of action. Were you willing\nto embark upon your prescribed program of corrective therapy, and\nso become a normally active and emotionally stable woman, then the\nmarriage might work out very well indeed.\"\n\n\"It's all my fault, of course?\"\n\n\"Yes. Of course. The decision was yours to make.\"\n\n\"And how about that lump of lard you've foisted off on me?\"\n\n\"Bertram Harrison's willing retreat into total lethargy is, of course,\nhis own decision. But it, too, is only another aspect of the usual\ncase. The strong-willed personality makes its own way. The weak one\nfollows.\"\n\n\"I see,\" sneered Gloria. \"It's all my fault!\"\n\n\"Of course it is,\" snapped Scholar Ross. \"Were you willing to correct\nyourself, you'd also have been willing to correct Bertram since yours\nis the stronger personality.\"\n\n\"So what's the next move? Do I get to try another dolt?\"\n\n\"Hardly. You'd do the same with any of them.\"\n\n\"So what is it? Am I going to be exported to Eden, Tau Ceti as an\nincorrigible?\"\n\nScholar Ross was silent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Hanford said, \"Certainly there must be another way?\"\n\nMrs. Hanford said, \"Must I lose my daughter?\"\n\nScholar Ross said regretfully, \"There is another way, of course, but\neither way is essentially a loss of your daughter, Mrs. Hanford.\"\n\nMr. Hanford said, \"And what is this other course, Scholar Ross?\"\n\n\"It's called re-orientation.\"\n\n\"Brain-washing!\" exclaimed Gloria.\n\n\"That's a harsh, colloquial term.\"\n\nMrs. Hanford said, \"How does this re-orientation work?\"\n\nColdly, as if he were discussing the repair of some inanimate engine,\nScholar Ross said, \"It starts with corrective surgery on the pituitary\nand thyroid glands. Next comes some very complicated neuro-cerebral\nsurgery, somewhat resembling the crude, primitive process once called\n'Prefrontal Lobotomy'. Nowadays it produces the desired effect without\nall of the deleterious side-effects. Then, once the patient is\ncompletely disoriented, the process of re-education takes place. The\npatient is extremely docile and highly impressionable. All decisions\ncarry the same weight--\"\n\n\"How do you mean that?\" asked Mr. Hanford.\n\n\"Why, the decision to use blue or black ink in your fountain pen\nbecomes as important as the decision of whether to cling or jump from a\ndamaged aircar.\"\n\n\"Oh. And then?\"\n\n\"Why, since the patient is docile and impressionable, we can mold the\npatient's appreciation of people, places, and events into conformity.\nEvents of the former life are not erased, but they are viewed as if the\npatient had seen a trivideo drama instead of having been that person.\nThe entire list of friends and acquaintances is changed because the\npatient's personality is so different that the former friends no longer\nhave anything in common with the patient. It will be,\" said Scholar\nRoss, \"exactly as if your daughter left you, never to return, and then\nnext year you are introduced to a strange woman who bears a complete\nresemblance to your daughter. To whom,\" he added, \"you eventually\nbecome emotionally attached because of your daughter's memory.\"\n\n\"It sounds pretty drastic.\"\n\n\"I shall not fool you. It is drastic, indeed.\"\n\n\"I don't like it,\" Gloria snapped.\n\n\"Yes,\" pleaded Mrs. Hanford. \"What is the alternative?\"\n\n\"Eden, Tau Ceti. I'll arrange transportation under the migration act,\nand she'll be permitted two hundred pounds of gross.\" Scholar Ross\nsmiled thinly. \"You can diet a few pounds off and thus increase the\nnet weight of your allowable possessions,\" he said. \"But, on the other\nhand, if you diet down to rail-skinny no one will take a chance on you.\"\n\nGloria demanded belligerently, \"What am I, a raffle prize?\"\n\n\"Why, that's no better than white slavery!\" cried her mother.\n\n\"Oh, come now!\" said Scholar Ross. \"Miss Hanford will receive a\nhome and a hard-working husband on a fine new world with unlimited\nopportunities.\"\n\nGloria Hanford snorted. \"The term, 'unlimited opportunity' is just the\noptimist's way of describing a situation that the pessimist would call,\n'lack of modern conveniences.'\"\n\n\"Well, Miss Hanford, you have your choice. One of three. Corrective\ntherapy and marriage with Bertram Harrison; total re-orientation; or\nmigration to Eden, Tau Ceti. I'll not ask for your decision now. Give\nme your answer within thirty days.\"\n\n\"You can't force me!\"\n\n\"No. I can't. All I can do is to point out your three avenues of future\ntravel--and then point out that I do have the means of making your\nlife so very inconvenient that you'll have no recourse but to make\nyour choice from among the three desirable possibilities. Desirable, I\nmust admit, means that which is most favorable to the furtherance of\ndomestic tranquility!\"\n\n\nVII\n\nLalande 25372 is a Spectral Class M star, a faint red dwarf not visible\nto the naked eye from Earth, Sol. Lalande 25372 lies fifteen point\nnine light years from Sol, about fifteen degrees north of the celestial\nequator and not quite opposite the vernal equinox. It has planets,\nbut this does not make Lalande 25372 unique. Like most of the planets\nfound in space, neither mad dogs nor Englishmen would have anything to\ndo with them--willingly. They are suitable only for the hapless wight\nwhose erring foot has unhappily landed on the tender official toe.\n\nThe planet Flatbush, Lalande 25372, received its name from an obscure\nmedieval reference to a form of punishment known as \"Walking a beat in\nFlatbush,\" if we are to believe MacClelland's authoritative volume _The\nOrigin of Place Names_.\n\nObserved through the multipane window of the Station, Flatbush, Lalande\n25372, was a pleasant enough planet, provided one could ignore the fact\nthat there was not a sign nor trace of vegetation from the Installation\nBuilding to the horizon. A couple of hundred yards from the building\nthere was a pleasant looking lake. The lake was indeed water, but\nit contained dissolved substances that would have poisoned a boojum\nsnark. The warm wind of Flatbush rippled the surface of the lake, but\nno square yard of sail would be hoisted until someone first built a\ngas mask that would filter out the colorless gases that turned silver\nblack. Fluffy clouds floated across the sky, but they rained down a\nmess that etched stainless steel.\n\nOut There, near the perimeter of Man's five-parsec range of operations,\nsubelectromagnetic detector beams scoured the sky. Taking the most\npessimistic standpoint--the least possible combinations of Nature's\ninfinite variety of environment--Nature's own profligacy with\nlife-forms still demanded that somewhere, Out There, another race was\nplying the spaceways.\n\nSomeday this hypothetical race was certain to touch wings with mankind.\n\nWhen that took place it was the duty of the Bureau of Operations to\ndetect them, to intercept them, and to warn the men of Earth, Sol,\nthat Mankind was no longer alone. The fact that the subelectromagnetic\ndetecting beams had been sweeping space for a couple of hundred years\nwithout detecting anything had no bearing on the future. The beams must\nbe maintained so long as a human man remained alive in space.\n\nIn addition to the detector beams, the outlying planets carried\nastrogation beacons. They were subelectromagnetic lighthouses, so\nto speak, that rang across space with known direction and ranging\ntelemetered signals. Someday, Man hoped to fill the space lanes with\nspacecraft and the planets with interstellar commerce.\n\nSomeday there might be another _Marie Celeste_ plying its course with\nits crew inexplicably missing. But if this ever happened, it was not\ngoing to happen without the Space Service knowing precisely how many\nand which spacecraft were operating through that volume of space\nbefore, during, and after D-for-Disaster Day and M-for-Mysterious\nMinute.\n\nThe equipment, of course, was automated to modern perfection, with\nmulti-lateral channels that would take over in case of component\nfailure. Its factor of reliability was well above six or seven nines\nof perfection. But to admit that this perfection was adequate would\nhave deprived the Space Service of a convenient minor penal detail to\ntake care of brash junior officers. Manning such a station provided the\njunior officer with a wealth of time to contemplate his sins, and to\nmend his evil ways.\n\nIn the case of Junior Spaceman Howard Reed, this process consisted of\nlocating the flaw that prevented Hansen's Folly from being Hansen's\nAnalysis.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow, from the time of Alexander Selkirk, romantic history has been\ndotted with accounts of men who have been cast away with nothing more\nthan their hands and their brains. And with these, they have succeeded\nin raising their caveman environment up to the level of modern\ntechnical conveniences.\n\nLike them--having been unable to locate the flaw in Hansen's Folly by\nthe theoretical approach during his tour of duty on Earth, Sol, and\nhaving similarly failed to locate the error in experimental hardware\nduring his tour of duty on Eden, Tau Ceti--Junior Spaceman Howard\nReed began to experiment on the spacecraft that stood parked on its\nlaunching pad two hundred feet from the Installation. There was\nplenty of equipment to work with. The Space Service did not stock its\nperimeter stations in a slipshod manner.\n\nFurthermore, Junior Spaceman Howard Reed had plenty of time.\n\nThe account of his life and adventures is hardly worth telling. He had\nno distractions. He worked. The months passed one after the other.\n\nFlatbush, Lalande 25372 was so far out that there was no provision\nmade for a regular tour of inspection. Nobody bothered to drop in on\nJunior Spaceman Howard Reed. Gabbling on the official communication\nchannels was strictly forbidden, so the young junior officer was\ndenied even contact by voice. No one had come up with an economically\nsound means of producing entertainment programs from Earth, Sol, on\nthe subelectromagnetic beams and so he--like his fellows in the other\nperimeter stations--received neither news nor music from home.\n\nHe could terminate this tour of duty only by solving the riddle of\nHansen's Folly, and then notifying his superiors on the official\ncommunications channels--or by tucking a note in the once-each-year\nsupply drone that came laden with enough of Earth's environment to keep\nthe young expatriate alive for another year.\n\nThe set-up was wholly conducive to work. There was time and there was\nequipment; his orders were to remain there until he had studied his way\nthrough the problem.\n\nWith nothing else to do, Junior Spaceman Howard Reed was deep in\nhis investigation ... when the drone spacecraft came down along the\nsubelectromagnetic beacon and made its landing a dozen yards away.\n\nThe drone was standard spacecraft size, an unmanned hull laden with the\nnecessities of life that would support him for a year.\n\nIt was the first one that he had ever seen. This was the first time\nthat Junior Spaceman Howard Reed had had to face the problem of Supply.\nPacked in that droneship was enough earth environment to last a man\na year. The perishables and expendables, as well as replacement for\nthe lost fractions of the recyclables, were all there. They were\ndehydrated and deep frozen after all waste had been removed, then\ncompressed into cubes of identical size for the most favorable packing\nfraction. Even so, it was a prodigious amount of stuff. Supply would\nhave been impossible on a once-per-year basis, if the foul water of\nFlatbush, Lalande 25372, hadn't been distillable with ease.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe junior spaceman eyed the droneship with a sudden burst of pride\nin his fellow man's accomplishment. Given a pre-programmed flight\nalong telemetered beacons originating at either terminus, the running\nequipment within the drone would bulk much less than the same mass and\nsize as a human and his needs. Until flight-decisions were necessary,\nthe hardware pilot was as good as the human pilot--and far less subject\nto headache, tantrum, disappointment at not getting the Saturday night\npass and resentment over being passed by at promotion time.\n\nThen his pride gave way to sudden, prolonged thought.\n\nThe range of a spacecraft is computed from point of takeoff to point of\nno return. There was no way of restoring the powerbanks of a spacecraft\nexcept on Earth, Sol.\n\nNow, of course, it is entirely possible to take off and just keep going\nuntil the powerbanks are depleted.\n\nThat will cover twice the stated range to the point of no return.\nShips have gone out and off and away and have never been heard of\nagain. It is possible that one or more of these have succeeded in\nlocating an Earth-like planet beyond the point of no return, but the\nEarthmen at home will never know about it until the range is extended.\nThe possibility of such a planet favoring human life and ultimately\nharboring a culture of technical competence enough to create and\nmaintain the power restoring equipment is extremely remote.\n\nFor spacecraft that carry women are few and far between.\n\nAnd it takes more than one man's lifetime to make use of the know-how.\n\nJunior Spaceman Howard Reed knew that away back in the Twentieth\nCentury, the average engineer could make a guess, count on his fingers,\nand come up with a pretty shrewd estimate of the horsepower per cubic\ninch that could be stored by the various ways and means available to\nthe age.\n\nRemoving the human pilot and his needs did give the droneship quite a\nbit more space for cargo and power. But, as he looked at the droneship\nstanding there, it became plain to Junior Spaceman Howard Reed that\nthere was not room in that size of hull for both the necessary\npowerbanks and the full year's store of supplies for one man.\n\nWhereupon Junior Spaceman Howard Reed dropped his tools. He donned his\nspace suit and crossed the intervening space to the droneship.\n\nHe began to examine the ship's running gear with a critical and\nsuspicious eye.\n\nHe was examining hardware that was familiar to him. It took him no\nmore than two hours to determine beyond a shadow of a doubt that\nthe droneship's drive was built along the theories and mathematical\nanalysis that he had been told simply did not work!\n\nSomeone had reduced Hansen's Folly to practice!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe paused again. Hansen's Folly had been called a failure about two\nhundred years ago, but what did that really mean? He considered his\nhistory.\n\nIn 1724, Stephen Gray and Granville Wheeler made the proud announcement\nthat they had succeeded in transmitting an electrical phenomenon along\na wire for a distance of 682 feet. Two hundred years later the entire\nEarth was girdled with telegraph, telephone and cable wires and linked\nwith the invisible bonds of radio waves.\n\nIn about 1904 the Wright Brothers made their first powered airplane\nflight. Forty years later men were flying in airplanes that carried a\nwingspread greater than the distance of the Wright's first flight.\n\nEinstein's Barrier was accepted scientific dogma for a hundred years;\nbut he, Howard Reed, was now standing in a spacecraft that had crossed\nthe gulf between the stars at a speed that not only exceeded the\nvelocity of propagated light--but exceeded this speed by a few hundred\norders of magnitude.\n\nSo? So maybe they were right. Maybe Hansen's Folly was a failure.\n\nBut the running gear in this droneship was designed to the analysis\nproduced by Junior Spaceman Howard Reed, and it worked. Furthermore,\nhe had only the scornful word of Commander Briggs of the Bureau of\nResearch that his arguments had been parallel to those of the hapless\nHansen.\n\nIt would hardly be the first time in the history of the human race that\nsome bureaucrat got fat on the work of his underlings who not only\nreceived no credit for their work, but were often hushed, hidden, or\notherwise prevented from proving their right to the fame and fortune.\n\nAngrily, Howard Reed stood up and cursed. They were not going to\nsmother him in a peg-whittling job on a single-man post sixteen light\nyears from home base, denied of all but official communications.\n\nHe was going to find out about this very strange business!\n\nJunior Spaceman Howard Reed did not even bother going back to the\nStation. Its Outside detectors had been sweeping deep space for a\ncouple of hundred years without detecting anything; its astrobeacons\nwere employed once each year when the droneship arrived. Furthermore,\nboth equipments were automatic, on the trips, set up to bypass the\none-man crew of the Station by transmitting the information on the\nregular Channels. So, there in the droneship, the junior spaceman\nmerely disconnected the pre-programmed autopilot, clamped his hands\naround the manual gear, and took off for far-off Earth, Sol.\n\n\nVIII\n\nGloria Hanford opened her apartment door, made a double take when she\nsaw the living room lights were on, toted up the list of unexpected\nguests, and assessed the situation in one brief moment. She stopped\nshort on one high heel, pivoted, and said to her escort, \"Not tonight,\nJoseph!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I've guests,\" she said, placing a hand flat on her escort's chest.\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"My guests mean trouble,\" she finished, shoving. Her escort\ndisappeared--walking backward and still trying to protest.\n\nGloria closed the living room door with a gesture of finality, then\nturned to lean back against it. She faced her unexpected guests with an\nair of exasperated patience, as if by her silence she was inviting them\nto hurl the first bolt and by her attitude confident that she could\nturn it aside with ease.\n\nShe did not have long to wait.\n\nThey all started to talk at once. The resulting babble was\nunintelligible and the sound of the others' voices made each one of\nthem stop without finishing. Silence fell again, and in the calm,\nScholar Ross spoke up:\n\n\"Under the circumstances, Miss Hanford, I think we have the right to\nask that you explain your actions.\"\n\nMr. Harrison grunted. \"I say this is a waste of time. Let's get along\nwith it.\"\n\nMrs. Harrison added, \"Yes indeed, Scholar Ross. If you'll call the\nauthorities, we'll sign the complaint.\"\n\nMrs. Hanford snapped, \"I resent the implication that my daughter is\nwholly and solely in the wrong.\"\n\nMr. Hanford said, \"In my opinion, Bertram Harrison isn't bright enough\nto come in out of the rain, let alone being smart enough to know what's\ngood for him. Now--\"\n\nMr. Harrison growled, \"We come calling this evening and find our son\ndeep under the influence of tranquilizers and the catalytic action of\nthe mood music prescribed for this philandering young hussy--\"\n\n\"I'm no philanderer!\" cried Gloria. \"I'm not married to your cold lump\nof lard!\"\n\nScholar Ross spread out his hands in a gesture of supplication, as if\nhe were pleading with the gods for a return to sanity. \"Stop it!\" he\ncried. \"Stop it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned to Mrs. Hanford with a shake of the head. \"I am sorry.\nYour resentment of the fact that this affair is your daughter's\nresponsibility is not going to change it.\"\n\n\"But he's--\"\n\n\"Please, Mrs. Hanford. This engagement is not a matter of the personal\nchoice of the participants. It gravely concerns Society. Now, insofar\nas the Department of Domestic Tranquility is concerned, it is the\nexcitable, headstrong, unruly, willful personality that is dangerous\nto social stability. The calm and placid ones do not commit acts of\nviolence. Indeed, Mrs. Hanford, were it not for the quiet, phlegmatic\npersonality like Bertram Harrison, we in genetics would have a hard\ntime finding a useful niche for belligerents such as your daughter\nGloria.\"\n\nGloria Hanford said something under her breath. Scholar Ross eyed her\nsuspiciously and demanded that she repeat.\n\n\"Cliche Sixteen,\" she retorted. \"It pertains to the problem of leading\nhorses to water.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Yes. The horse is laudably exercising as much free will\nas his equine position permits him. The same platitude can also be\nemployed to point out that blind stubbornness may prevent him from\ndoing something that is really a good idea even if someone else did\nthink of it first.\"\n\n\"I say enough of this nonsense!\" snapped Mr. Harrison. \"Let's get this\ndebate over with!\"\n\n\"Now, just a moment,\" said Scholar Ross. \"You have no legal standing.\nMiss Hanford is Bertram Harrison's affianced wife. Under law, any\ndifficulties between them are strictly a civic matter. Bluntly, sir,\nonly the party being damaged can sign a complaint, and after making a\ncomplaint it is up to the complaining party to prove that he is being\ndamaged at the will of the accused.\"\n\n\"Scholar Ross, you and your Department of Domestic Tranquility may know\nhow you hope to maintain a calm and stable social structure, but you\ndon't know much about the law,\" said Mr. Harrison slowly and carefully.\n\"One only need go back to the early days of common law to find a rather\nterse discussion of the proposition of maintaining an attractive\nnuisance. The owner of the attractive nuisance has a responsibility to\nthe gullible citizens who are attracted.\"\n\n\"Meaning?\"\n\n\"Meaning,\" said Mr. Harrison, \"that Miss Hanford in this pre-marriage\napartment did maintain a series of attractive nuisances. Tranquilizer\npills. Soothing mood music. A person of calm tendencies would find them\nmost attractive. It was therefore her responsibility to protect the\nother party. Now--when Bertram has been properly treated and is able\nto testify--I think we'll find that Miss Hanford not only failed to\nprotect Bertram, but indeed encouraged him to help himself to her pills\nand sleep in her bedroom under the soothing influence of the mood music\nprescribed for her.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Hanford snapped, \"If this attractive nuisance is as you say,\nHarrison, why can't we charge that Bertram did little to protect Gloria\nfrom his own therapy?\"\n\nScholar Ross raised a hand. \"Permit me,\" he said, \"to reiterate that\nit is the hypertonic, overactive personalities that create social\ntroubles. A Bertram Harrison lulled into a semi-cataleptic state by the\nwiles of a Gloria Hanford would hardly be expected to rise in a sudden\nburst of strength.\"\n\n\"So no matter what I do, I'm wrong?\" the girl asked.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Scholar Ross. \"It is your direct\nresponsibilty--your _duty_--to do everything you can to establish a\nfirm and stable family unit here with Bertram Harrison--\"\n\n\"Sorry, Scholar Ross,\" said Mr. Harrison icily. \"You haven't really\nheard me. Your notion that this affair is a civil argument between an\naffianced couple is not true. You imply that no laws have been broken.\nYou are wrong. I am willing to sign a complaint right now that Miss\nGloria Hanford deliberately induced my son to indulge in her therapy.\nIt was her means of lulling him into a state of mind that would permit\nher to go gallivanting off on a date with another man.\"\n\n\"I am not married to Berty yet!\" snapped Gloria. \"Dating's still my\nright!\"\n\n\"Oh,\" snarled Mr. Harrison angrily, \"shut up or I'll sign a complaint\nthat you administered medical treatment without a license! Insofar as\nthe Harrison family is concerned, this engagement shall be terminated\nunfavorably. Come!\" he said to his wife. She rose to follow.\n\nGloria stepped aside, but paused to ask, \"Aren't you going to take\nBertie with you?\"\n\nMrs. Hanford said coldly, \"He's already been taken to the hospital for\ntreatment to bring him out of the trance you got him into. And so, Miss\nHanford, will you please step aside and let me pass?\"\n\nAnd Mr. Harrison's parting shot was, \"I shall sign my complaints in\nthe morning--or if he is able, we'll make it thoroughly legal and have\nBertram sign them.\"\n\nHe closed the door firmly.\n\nMrs. Hanford wailed, \"Now what shall we do?\"\n\nScholar Ross shook his head. \"With this poor record, this\nnon-cooperation,\" he said slowly, \"it will be well nigh impossible\nto arrange another union, furthermore, if Harrison carries out his\nthreat--\"\n\nGloria said quickly, \"If he wants to, he can talk Bertie into anything.\nAnything. Such as signing the most frightful complaints and being\nconvinced of their absolute truth and justice.\"\n\nMr. Hanford said, \"If that's true, he could also be talked back out of\nthem.\"\n\nScholar Ross shook his head again. \"That presupposes that you could\narrange access to Bertram that couldn't be overcome by another\ntalking-to by his parents. It won't work. The young man is a mental\nweathervane.\"\n\n\"So where do we stand?\"\n\n\"As I say, we might as well prepare for the worst. If the case of\nGloria Hanford ever comes under the scrutiny of the Law, she will be\ndeclared either a delinquent or an incorrigible, depending upon whether\nher escapades are ruled misdemeanors or felonies.\" Scholar Ross turned\nto Gloria Hanford. \"I warned you. Now, where we of the Department of\nDomestic Tranquility have no power to force you into a proper course\nof action, you'll find that the Law most certainly has. Miss Hanford,\nthe Law will decide just how dangerous you are to the civic peace. Upon\nthat decision, the law will further decide what action it must take to\nprotect that civic peace from you.\"\n\nHe paused. A silence followed his statements. He waited a few moments\nto let his words sink in. Then he walked to the door and said:\n\n\"As of now, the future of Miss Gloria Hanford is out of my hands.\"\n\nMr. Hanford said, \"Scholar Ross, how bad is this likely to be?\"\n\n\"A lot will depend upon how swiftly Bertram Harrison responds to the\nrestorative treatment. With some luck and a brilliant attorney on your\nside the matter might not reach a major catastrophe. Tomorrow may tell.\"\n\n\nIX\n\nJunior Spaceman Howard Reed said plaintively, \"But this is the Bureau\nof Justice. According to the Regulations you are supposed to listen to\nme, at least.\"\n\nThe space officer behind the desk wore the three wide stripes of the\ncommander's rank, topped by the fasces that symbolized the law. He was\nCommander Hughes, chief of the Space Service Bureau of Justice. He\nsmiled at the junior spaceman but shook his head. \"You would place us\nin a most difficult position were we to heed your plea without having\nthe matter referred to us through official channels.\"\n\nWith some exasperation, Reed said, \"Look, sir, I've been subject to a\nsevere injustice. Why can't I at least tell my problem to someone?\"\n\n\"That would be cutting across channels. It simply is not done.\"\n\n\"Commander Hughes,\" said the junior spaceman earnestly, \"you're not\nserving justice. You're obstructing it!\"\n\n\"Now see here, young man--\"\n\n\"Commander Hughes, you're insisting that I request my superior officer\nto forward through official channels a complaint against him. First,\nsir, I point out that he would refuse my request unless he were\nabsolutely certain that my case against him was ridiculously weak.\nSecond, I'm certain that the request would bring quick retaliation.\"\n\nCommander Hughes shook his head. \"The Regulation provides that any\nreasonable request be forwarded. And the Regulation further provides\nthat there shall be no punitive action.\"\n\nReed snorted. \"Fine. And if I do find myself punished, must I next\nforward my request for investigation through the same officer?\"\n\n\"That is a serious charge, young man.\"\n\n\"I can substantiate it! Look, sir, quite a long time ago I made some\nscientific studies, and--\"\n\n\"You're an Operations officer, Mr. Reed?\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"Then you're not trained in science?\"\n\n\"Let's not go on that rat-race right now,\" said the junior spaceman\ntestily. \"I've heard it before. That's why I'm here!\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nJunior Spaceman Howard Reed took a deep breath and plunged into his\nlong explanation. At the end, Commander Hughes nodded, his face in a\nnon-committal mask.\n\n\"One moment now,\" he said. He turned to the working desk behind him\nand spoke into a telephone. It had neither visual plate nor amplified\noutput; only the user could know what was being communicated, and with\nwhom.\n\n\"Now we'll see,\" said the commander as he hung up the telephone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the awkwardness of a stopped trivideo drama they stood and sat\nthere motionless and silently as the minutes dragged past. Ultimately\nthere was a gentle alarm ring from one of the desk drawers. Commander\nHughes opened it to extract a couple of yards of stereofac paper.\n\n\"Your service record,\" explained the commander, picking up a reading\nprism and starting at the top. \"Just another moment.\"\n\nAnother half dozen minutes went past.\n\n\"'Junior Spaceman Howard Reed,'\" the commander read quietly at last,\n\"'has an exemplary record.' That is Commander Breckenridge's opinion,\nif we are to believe what we read in this record. Oh, perhaps, he\nthought, a bit headstrong and mildly argumentative, factors which he\nconsidered balanced by a faculty for deep concentration.\"\n\n\"And how about my being transferred to Eden, Tau Ceti? And then to\nFlatbush, Lalande 25372?\" Reed demanded.\n\n\"'Reasons for transfer,'\" read Commander Hughes from the record.\n\"'Junior Spaceman Howard Reed is ambitious and overactive. In the\nconsidered opinion of Commander Breckenridge, he will make a fine\nsuperior officer once his duty-experience has the proper breadth.'\"\nThe commander looked up and waved a hand at the length of stereofac.\nThe fasces wrought in gold above the stripes glittered in the light.\n\"Were it not for the Regulations against permitting a junior officer to\ninspect his own service record,\" said Commander Hughes with a smile,\n\"I'd let you see for yourself that nowhere on this record is there a\nsingle word that corroborates your suggestion. Your tour of duty on\nFlatbush, Lalande 25372, and your earlier transfer to Eden, Tau Ceti,\nwere merely the standard tour of duty, granted to satisfactory junior\nofficers as a means of properly broadening their experience.\"\n\n\"In other words,\" snapped Reed angrily, \"the fact that I have crossed\nspace in a craft powered by a technical suggestion made by me some\nyears ago does not prove a thing.\"\n\n\"Can you prove that you made any such technical suggestion?\"\n\n\"Yes. Call Commander Briggs of the Bureau of Research. Call Commander\nBreckenridge of the Bureau of Operations. Demand that they state under\noath, whether I did or did not make such suggestions. I was told my\nideas were worthless.\"\n\n\"In other words, the Bureau of Research says it wouldn't work?\"\n\n\"But look, sir! I drove a spacecraft all the way from--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Bureau of Justice officer held up a hand.\n\n\"Look,\" said the junior spaceman angrily, \"all I want is justice!\"\n\n\"And justice you'll get!\" retorted Commander Hughes. \"First, Mr. Reed,\nlet me ask how you obtained permission to leave your post on Flatbush,\nLalande 25372, so that you could come to the headquarters in person to\nstate your plea? Or was this trip authorized?\"\n\n\"Well, sir--the detector and beacon stations are completely automated\nand--\"\n\n\"In blunt terms you are absent without leave?\"\n\n\"Well, sir--\"\n\n\"Junior Spaceman Howard Reed, you will consider yourself under personal\narrest. We have no alternative but to place you in the custody of the\nSpace Security Police. Remain as you were!\"\n\nLike the fabled case of the drowning man, Junior Spaceman Howard Reed\nreviewed his past in a single flash before his eyes. In the second\nblink, he covered his present. It wasn't to his liking.\n\nHaving covered his past and discarded his present, he next inspected\nhis most probable future and came to the almost immediate conclusion\nthat there wasn't very much in it for him. He had never heard\nNapoleon's statement that God was on the side with the heaviest\nartillery, but, in his own way, Junior Spaceman Howard Reed came to\na parallel conclusion. Justice was on the side of the heaviest rank.\nBitterly, he reflected that the reward for a technical suggestion of\ngreat merit was that they wouldn't make any trouble for him--so long as\nhe didn't try to claim credit for it.\n\nHe came back to his dangerous present quickly. Commander Hughes was\ntalking briskly into his secret telephone.\n\nWith a quick gesture, the junior spaceman leaned forward over the\ndesk and snatched the instrument out of the senior officer's hands.\nHe hauled in on the connecting cord until it came taut, and then he\nyanked, ripping the cord from its terminals. Brusquely, he dropped the\ntelephone instrument into the commander's waste basket.\n\nThen as bells began to ring and corridor horns began to sound, Junior\nSpaceman Howard Reed left the administration building of the Bureau of\nJustice on a dead run. Out in the street the wail of a siren began to\nclimb from its throaty basso to its ear-splitting ululation.\n\n\nX\n\nGloria Hanford awoke, as she always did, with full awareness, like\nthe transition of a small animal from slumber to flight. It was not\na languid hand that reached for the telephone that had awakened her\nbut an alert one. It flipped the accept button up and the vidphone\neye button down in a single twisting gesture of thumb and forefinger.\nIt was not modesty that caused the turn-down of the vidphone eye. It\nwas vanity. Gloria Hanford deemed unbrushed teeth, uncombed hair, and\nunwashed face both unacceptable and unattractive.\n\n\"Gloria Hanford here. Go ahead.\"\n\n\"Scholar Ross calling. Miss Hanford, you should know so that you can\nbe prepared. Bertram Harrison has not yet responded to corrective\ntherapy.\"\n\n\"Not--yet--responded,\" she repeated slowly. \"Just how bad is this,\nScholar Ross?\"\n\n\"It is quite grave. It's possible there may be cerebral deterioration.\"\n\n\"You mean Bertram might even go from bad to worse?\"\n\n\"Miss Hanford, will you cease treating this as if it were a comedy? You\nmay be defending yourself against charges of criminal negligence. It\nmight even get to the charge of homicide before it's done.\"\n\n\"Homicide? But he isn't dead!\"\n\n\"Fifth degree homicide,\" said Scholar Ross, \"comprises the process\nof causing by any means the loss of impairment of personality or\nintellect. In layman's terms, _brain-washing_.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"So if I were you I'd dress and be ready for the authorities.\nHarrison forced a special session of court last night and had Bertram\ndeclared as invalid-incommunicado. Since your engagement was formally\ndissolved, this places Bertram's well-being under the discretion of his\nnext-of-kin blood relations. Father Harrison is prepared to prosecute\nto the fullest extent. He's even petitioned for the right to take\naction against the Department of Domestic Tranquility for what he calls\n'incompetent meddling.' So you see, it looks bad.\"\n\n\"Maybe there ought to be some thoughtful laws passed to protect we\nactive ones from the dolts and dullards,\" said Gloria. \"Okay, Scholar\nRoss, I'll take steps!\"\n\nIn a flurry of expert motion, Gloria Hanford dressed, packed, and left.\n\nThe authorities who came for her hadn't had enough experience in\ndealing with the hypertonic, overactive, fast-thinking, anti-social\ntype. They expected to find a slightly fuzzy-minded, still\nhalf-aslumber girl, unable to grasp both an idea and a dressing gown at\nthe same time. They would not have equated their notion with the trim,\nalert, neatly and completely dressed young lady they passed on the\nstairs if it hadn't been for the standard, legal locks on all apartment\ndoors. A tiny flag filled a small aperture only when the full bolt was\ncast home by a flip of the inside key.\n\nIts absence meant that no one was inside.\n\nThe chief of the group forced his mental image through a mental\nphotomontage that started with the original picture of the\nhalf-awakened young woman tossing a tousle of hair back out of\none eye, passed through a much-abridged version of the process\nof female dressing, and concluded with the trim and striking\nnumber they'd passed on the stairway. Add important item: As an\naccessory, whistle-bait was also carrying an overnight bag in one\nformal-for-travelling, white-gloved hand.\n\nNudged, his memory was good.\n\nHe hauled his handset out while his men were still making dead certain\nthat the little flag on the lock meant precisely what it said. By the\ntime they were convinced that the apartment was truly empty and the\nlock bolted from the outside, he had unabashedly reported his failure,\nand was concluding a very excellent description of the fugitive Gloria\nHanford.\n\n\nXI\n\nThe average citizen, faced with an impressive uniform, falls into one\nof two very widely divided camps. One of these camps contains those of\nus who are impressed by the visible, exalted rank of the wearer.\n\nSo, by the simple process of snapping, \"Official business!\" at the\ndriver of a skycab and simultaneously tossing the driver his official\nI. D. card in its ornate leather folder, Junior Spaceman Howard Reed\nsucceeded in commandeering a skycab.\n\nHe took off, leaving the driver in a razzle-dazzle dream of collecting\nmileage from the Space Service whilst he spent the time comfortably\nrelaxing in a pub. Protected from public gaze by the camouflaging\nskycab, the junior spaceman proceeded to cruise up the middle level of\nAncient Fifth Avenue, driving a full eighteen inches below the legal\naltitude set for cruising skycabs.\n\nHe turned on his pocket set to listen to the details of the search that\nwas being organized for him.\n\nAbove him, all around him, even in the subways below him, the vast and\nefficient organization of the Military Space Service was converging.\nThis organization had the will and the manpower to scour this city of\ntwenty million people almost literally soul by soul if the need be, to\nlocate a young officer in the uniform of a Junior Spaceman. He might\nbe driving a Military Vehicle, but more likely would be found in one\nof the many public vehicles or public carriers that the city offered\nfor civilian transportation. There was also the high possibility that\nJunior Spaceman Howard Reed might be located afoot on the static\nsidewalk or on one of the tramways.\n\nAnd so, mentally clocking each time-point and making a careful note\nof the check-points, the junior spaceman built up a mental map of the\ncity and its danger points. Until the laws of simple logic failed to\noperate, he was going to be exactly where they weren't.\n\nHe was, in the driver's seat of a skycab, precisely as invisible as\nThe Purloined Letter. But now, if he were to drive his skycab away from\nthe cruising level, he needed one more accessory. He had time. So long\nas the Military was looking for a Military man in Military surroundings\nand in a Military manner, he was as safe from detection as if he really\nowned the skycab he'd commandeered.\n\nThe civilian police were closer to success.\n\nCalled by the chief of the arresting party who'd arrived at Gloria\nHanford's apartment too late by minutes, the minions of Law and Order\nconverged in their civilian efficiency. Logistically, it was a simple\nmatter of hare and hounds. The hare couldn't win. Only one question was\nimportant: Which of the hounds would?\n\nAfoot and by jetcopter that englobed the area, they closed in. By the\napplication of stored memory and studied information they erected\ninvisible barriers at every exposed point along the most probable trail\nof their quarry, from the street outside of her apartment door to the\ngarage stall in Monticello. Then, as a final clincher, they installed\nthree men in Gloria Hanford's airscooter itself.\n\nBy virtue of the unexpected movement one can elude the cops for a time.\nGloria, on the street before her apartment building, almost went into\ndespair when she saw that there was no skycab within hailing distance.\nShe almost took it as a personal affront.\n\nBut this was hardly the time to stamp her sandals on the hard pavement\nor to write letters to the Commissioner of Public Carriers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe turned and disappeared into the tramway entrance heading North\nalong Waterfront Avenue. Her coin had hardly hit the bottom of its\nslot when the mobile police converged to land on the spot she'd just\nvacated. The foremost of them saw her trim figure disappearing into the\ndistance, eclipsed by the myriads of innocent souls whose only desire\nwas to make use of the same Northbound Tramway.\n\nThe pursuit began to reshape its surface of detection from englobement\nto a cylinder, the axis of which lay congruent with the Northbound\nTramway.\n\nAgain, she held the advantage of knowing her own decision whereas\nher pursuit had to divine her plans by analysis of her actions and\nmaking use of extrapolation. Gloria Hanford abruptly stepped off the\nTramway at Fifty-third, walked briskly three long blocks to LaGuardia's\nSixth, found herself facing a group of burly policemen, and stopped\nlong enough to think. One of the cops shoved a galton whistle between\nhis teeth and blew a supersonic blast that registered on every cop's\ndetector within a quarter mile. Audibly a siren wailed. Inaudibly and\ninvisibly the drawstring web of civic forces began to close in.\n\nOnce more Gloria stepped into the kiosk of a tramway, the Crosstown.\nShe rode one more block to Ancient Fifth and stepped off. With a wave\nof her hand, and then the most startling process to be found in a\nwoman, Gloria Hanford poked two fingers in her mouth and let go with a\nshrill, piercing whistle that made every skycab driver within a half\nmile come to the point of 'customer's alert!'\n\nShe made her point.\n\nThe one accessory that Junior Spaceman Howard Reed needed was a\npassenger, preferably a female passenger that could be identified as\na female for a hundred yards through a high fog driven by a blinding\ngale. Old, beautiful, young or ugly didn't matter, so long as it was\nunmistakably woman. The Military wouldn't stop a skycab with a female\npassenger.\n\nHe needed his passenger because, until he could pull the taxi-meter\nflag--having filled the compartment with a customer--he was constrained\nby law to cruise. Cruising would get him nowhere; what he needed was\nthe flag-down ticket of admission to the upper traffic levels.\n\nThe whistle shrilled at him; he looked; and then with his spaceman's\nskill, Junior Spaceman Howard Reed made a mad reverse spiral landing\nthat nosed out a half dozen other cursing drivers. He hit ground zero\nat velocity zero on target zero and flipped open the skycab door so\nclose that Gloria Hanford did not have to take a middle ground step to\ngain entry.\n\nHe took off with a rush that tossed his passenger into the deep seat\nand slammed the compartment door without human effort. Then he went\ninto a cruel climbing turn that wore away twenty thousand flight miles\nof the engine bearings. He leveled off a thousand feet above Ancient\nFifth Avenue's top-most fast traffic level, and set his homing and\nwarning beacon to zero on the spaceport.\n\nIt did not bother him that his passenger hadn't taken the time to\nsupply him with the destination she desired. After all, Junior Spaceman\nHoward Reed was not really a skycab driver. He didn't care.\n\nGloria Hanford rebounded from the soft cushions of the skycab\ncompartment and struggled her way into a position that gave her a good\nlook out of the broad rear window. Her driver's mad upward spiral made\nher dizzy, but from the higher levels it was definitely obvious that\nthere was considerable concentration of movement down there below. Men\nand ground cars as well as jetcopters were closing down upon the spot\nthey'd just left.\n\nIt did not bother Gloria Hanford that her driver hadn't waited to\ninquire as to her destination. She was just happy that he hadn't. Her\ndestination consisted of swift flight along any vector in a solid\nsphere; hers was a reverse destination properly identified by the word\n\"elsewhere.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBehind them the city erupted with a criss-crossing of radio-directed\nsearchbeams, catching and identifying skycar after skycar. Up from\nthe city's traffic levels came jetcopters and squad hoppers and some\nraid-gun carriers; personnel boats; even a sprinkling of mobile\ncommunications bases. To one side and almost behind them a flight of\nstar shells burst in a fire-fall of gorgeous color. To their other side\na stream of warning tracer streaked.\n\nHoward poured on the coal.\n\nGloria made no protest; it was a most satisfactory agreement.\n\nThey buzzed across the Jersey Flats. He brought the skycab down on a\nflat slant landing that arrowed directly in and touched ground and\nskidded to a stop with all landing-gear brakes locked. They slid to\nwithin a few yards of the spacecraft.\n\nOnly then did the junior spaceman pause to speak to his passenger:\n\"Sorry, but I'm in a jam. So long!\"\n\nHe leaped out of the skycab, raced along the ground, went up the\nladder on a dead run, flipped into the spacelock, snapped the \"Close\"\nswitch as he passed the inner portal--and then, without waiting for\nany pre-flight checkout, Junior Spaceman Howard Reed resigned from the\nSpace Force by slamming his controls into an emergency and unauthorized\nflight program that took him up and out of Earth's atmosphere in barely\nmore than nothing flat.\n\nWhen he was free and clear, he relaxed in his pilot's seat, swiveled it\naround ... and boggled, bug-eyed, at his passenger.\n\nGloria Hanford, still trim and shipshape in her white sharkskin\nsuit, still carrying the overnight bag in her formal-for-travelling,\nwhite-gloved hand, sat in the spare seat.\n\nShe said: \"I'm sorry about this, too, but it so happens that I'm also\nin a jam. Where do we go from here, Spaceman?\"\n\nHe eyed her. \"Where do you want to go?\"\n\nGloria chuckled in a throaty voice. \"Away,\" she said.\n\n\"Can you cook?\" he demanded abruptly.\n\n\"Yes--why?\"\n\n\"Then go rustle up some grub from the galley,\" he directed. \"I'll have\nto keep an eye on this crate until we're free and clear. We can decide\nwhat to do next after we have time to think.\"\n\nShe looked at him strangely. Her own attitude puzzled her. It was the\nfirst time she'd been given an order that she hadn't resented, but\nthen of course his direction made very good sense.\n\nHe looked upon her as she rose--and he found her fair.\n\nShe was. Gloria Hanford was an extremely attractive dish in her own\nright. Amplified a few millionfold by the spaceman's enforced isolation\non Eden, Tau Ceti, and later upon Flatbush, Lalande 25372, she was a\ndream. Either locale would have the result of making Medusa the Gorgon\nlook like Miss Universe of All Time, but Gloria Hanford didn't need any\nhandicaps.\n\nBy some strange chemistry of non-material radiation that required no\ncatalyst, there was no question between them.\n\nOh, they had a lot to find out about one another, but they had plenty\nof time for that.\n\nThat and other things....\n\n\nXII\n\nIn the Officers' Club on Earth, someone said, \"What's the latest\nreport?\"\n\nCommander Breckenridge of Operations said, \"Last detected by the\nstation at Last Gasp, Ross 780, and going like hell wouldn't have them.\"\n\nCommander Hughes of the Bureau of Justice said, \"They're going at it\nrather early, aren't they?\"\n\nScholar Ross of the Department of Domestic Tranquility waved at his\ncomparison microscope and its data cards. \"It would be hard to find\ntwo people better suited to one another.\" He looked at his watch and\nsmiled. \"I'd say that by now they've both forgotten completely that\nthey were ever strangers.\"\n\nCommander Briggs of the Bureau of Research refilled the glasses with\nthe finest nonsynthetic vintage champagne that the cellar of the\nOfficers' Club could provide. He held his glass high and said, \"I toast\nthe bride and groom and the ultimate colonization of the Galaxy--by\nsubterfuge!\"\n\nBut Scholar Ross pulled the hand down. With a shake of his head, he\nheld his own glass high. \"Sorry, Briggs. But this time we toast the\nreactionaries, the die-hards and the rule-ridden old guard who have to\nwork like the very devil to pair off a deserving young couple, and then\nforce them into finding a home of their own--on some other planet.\n\n\"Gentlemen.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
