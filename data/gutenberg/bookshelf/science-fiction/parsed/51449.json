Because the\n             last detail may be just that--the final one!\n\n\nThe planet Lanit II had dwindled to a luminous speck. They were in\nclear space now, at Breakoff Point. Beliakoff held the ship in position\nwhile Kelly set dials for the jump into the hyperspatial drift opening,\nwhich deep-space men knew as the Slot.\n\nBeliakoff cracked his bony knuckles nervously. \"Now, Johnny,\" he said,\n\"easy this time. _Real_ easy. Gentle her into it. She's not a new ship.\nShe resents being slammed into the Slot.\"\n\n\"She'll take it,\" Kelly said, with a boyish grin of almost suicidal\nabandon.\n\n\"Maybe she will, but how about us? You sort of creased the Slot getting\nus off Torriang. A little closer and--\"\n\n\"I was still getting the touch. You ought to be glad I'm an\ninstinctive astrogator.\"\n\nHe set the last dial with a rapid twirl and reached for the kissoff\nswitch.\n\n\"You're out two decimal points,\" said Beliakoff, who worried about such\ntrifles. \"Enough to ionize us.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" Kelly grumbled, adjusting the dial. \"I was just\ntouching it for luck. Here we go!\"\n\nHe depressed the kissoff switch. Beliakoff shut his eyes as the ship\nlurched Slotward, wishing that Kyne, their government-inspected,\ncollege-graduated astrogator was still aboard. Kyne had been an expert\nat the job. But then, three planets back, he had suddenly gone after\na native stevedore with a micro-edge cleaver, screaming that no dirty\nalien would ever marry _his_ daughter.\n\nKyne had no daughter.\n\nCurrently he was confined in Azolith, awaiting transportation\nEarthside, to a padded little homy room in the Spaceman's Snug Port.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"How about that?\" Kelly asked proudly, once the ship was locked in\nhyperspace. \"Superior intelligence and steel nerves do the trick every\ntime.\"\n\n\"Poor devil, Kyne,\" Beliakoff sighed.\n\n\"A paranoid,\" Kelly diagnosed. \"Did he ever tell you about the plot to\nkeep him out of the Luna Military Academy?\"\n\n\"He never talked to me much.\"\n\n\"That's because you're a cold, distant, unsympathetic type,\" Kelly\nsaid, with a complacent smile. \"Me, he told everything. He applied to\nLuna every year. Studied all the textbooks on military organization,\nland tactics, sea tactics, space strategy, histories of warfare.\nCrammed his cabin with that junk. Knew it inside out. Fantastic memory!\"\n\n\"Why didn't he get in?\"\n\n\"Hemophilia. He couldn't pass the physical. He thought they were\nplotting against him. Still, I'm grateful for the chance at a little\nastrogation.\" With the barest hint of a smile, Kelly said, \"I\nunderstand it's possible to bring a ship sidewise through the Slot at\nTerra.\"\n\n\"Please don't try,\" Beliakoff begged, shuddering. \"I knew we should\nhave waited for Kyne's replacement at Mala.\"\n\n\"We'd still be there, with a cargo of kvash turning sour.\"\n\n\"I was afraid it would sour anyhow,\" Beliakoff said, with a worrier's\nknack for finding trouble. \"Mala is the slowest loading port this side\nof the Rift. I must admit, however, they didn't do badly this time.\"\n\n\"Noticed that, did you?\" Kelly asked.\n\n\"Hm? Did you find a way of speeding them up?\"\n\n\"Sure. Gave them Kyne's old dog-eared books. They're crazy about books.\nReally hustled for them.\"\n\nBeliakoff said nothing for several seconds, but his long, sallow face\nbecame pale. \"You what?\"\n\n\"Gave 'em the books. Don't worry,\" Kelly said quickly. \"Kyne gave them\nto me before they hauled him away.\"\n\n\"You gave the _warfare books_ to the people on Mala?\"\n\n\"You mean I shouldn't have? Why not? What's wrong with Mala?\"\n\n\"Plenty.\" Beliakoff grimly did some quick figuring. \"It'll be a year,\ntheir time, when we can get back. Kelly, take us out of hyperspace!\"\n\n\"Now?\" Kelly gasped. \"Here?\"\n\n\"At once!\"\n\n\"But we might come out inside a star or--\"\n\n\"That,\" Beliakoff said, his voice filled with righteousness, \"simply\ncannot be helped. We must return at once to Mala!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGeneral Drak, Commander of the Forces of the Empress, Wearer of the\nGold Star of Mala, sat at his desk in the Supreme Command Post, which\nhad recently been converted from a hardware store. He was engaged in a\nfiery argument over the telephone with Nob, the Empress's right-hand\nman.\n\n\"But damn it all,\" General Drak shouted, \"I must have it! I am the\nSupreme Commander, the General of All the Armies of the Dictatorship!\nDoesn't that mean anything?\"\n\n\"Not under the circumstances,\" Nob answered.\n\nTwo soldiers, standing guard in the General's quarters, listened\ninterestedly.\n\n\"Think he'll get it?\" one asked.\n\n\"Not a chance,\" the other answered.\n\nDrak glared them into silence, then returned to the argument. \"Will\nyou please attempt to understand my position?\" he said hoarsely. \"You\nput me in command. At my orders, the Armies of the Dictatorship move\nagainst the Allied Democracies. All the other generals obey me. _Me!_\nCorrect?\"\n\n\"He's got a point,\" one soldier said.\n\n\"He'll never get it,\" the other replied.\n\n\"Shut up, you two!\" Drak roared. \"Nob, aren't I right? It's the Earthly\nway, Nob. Authority must be recognized!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Nob said. \"Extremely sorry. Personally, I sympathize with\nyou. But the _Book of Terran Rank Equivalents_ is quite specific. Seven\nshoulder stars are the most--the absolute most--that any general can\nwear. I absolutely cannot allow you to wear eight.\"\n\n\"But you gave Frix seven! And he's just Unit General!\"\n\n\"That was before we understood the rules completely. We thought there\nwas no limit to the number of stars we could give and Frix was sulky.\nI'm sorry, General, you'll just have to be satisfied with seven.\"\n\n\"Take one away from Frix, then.\"\n\n\"Can't. He'll resign.\"\n\n\"In that case, I resign.\"\n\n\"You aren't allowed to. The book, _Military Leadership_, specifically\nstates that a Supreme Commander never resigns during hostilities. An\nEarthman would find the very thought inconceivable.\"\n\n\"All right!\" Drak furiously slammed down the telephone.\n\nThe two soldiers exchanged winks.\n\n\"At attention, you two,\" Drak said. \"You're supposed to be honor\nguards. Why can't you act like honor guards?\"\n\n\"We haven't got weapons,\" one of the soldiers pointed out.\n\n\"Can't be helped. I sent what we had to the front.\"\n\n\"But we need them here,\" the soldier said earnestly. \"It's bad for\nmorale, us not having weapons, and morale is vital for victory.\"\n\nDrak hated to be lectured, but he had to accept textbook truth when it\nwas quoted at him.\n\n\"You may be right,\" he agreed. \"I'll try to get some back.\"\n\nHe rubbed his eyes tiredly. Everything had happened so quickly!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust a week ago, Nob had walked into his store and inquired, \"Drak, how\nwould you like to be a general?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Drak had confessed honestly. \"What is it and why do we\nneed one?\"\n\n\"War starting,\" Nob said. \"You've heard of war, haven't you? Earth\nidea, _very_ Earthly. I'll explain later how it works. What do you say?\"\n\n\"All right. But do you really think I'm the right type?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. Besides, your hardware store is perfectly situated for the\nSupreme Command Post.\"\n\nBut aside from the location of his hardware store, Drak had other\nqualifications for leadership. For one thing, he looked like an Earth\ngeneral and this had loomed large in Nob's eyes. Drak was over six feet\ntall, strongly built, solidly muscled. His eyes were gray, deep-set and\nfierce; his nose was aquiline; his mouth was firm because he usually\nheld nails in it when he was out on a repair job.\n\nIn his uniform, Drak looked every inch a general; as a matter of fact,\nhe looked like several generals, for his cap came from the Earth-Mars\nwar of '82, his tunic was a relic of the D'eereli Campaign, his belt\nwas in the style of the Third Empire, his pants were a replica of the\nSouthern Star Front, while his shoes reminded one of the hectic days of\nthe Fanzani Rebellion.\n\nBut at least all his clothes were soldiers' clothes. His honor\nguard had to piece out their uniforms with personal articles. They\nhad complained bitterly about the injustice of this, and had come\nclose to deserting. But Drak, after some hasty reading in Smogget's\n_Leadership_, told them about the Terran doctrine of the Privileges of\nRank.\n\nIn front of him now was a report from the Allani Battle Front. He\nwasn't sure what it said, since it was coded and he had neglected to\nwrite down the code. Was it ENEMY REPULSED US WITH HEAVY LOSSES or\nshould it read US REPULSED ENEMY WITH HEAVY LOSSES?\n\nHe wished he knew. It made quite a difference.\n\nThe door burst open and a young corporal rushed in. \"Hey, General, take\na look out the window!\"\n\nDrak started to rise, then reconsidered. Rules were rules.\n\n\"Hey, what?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Forgot,\" the corporal said. \"Hey, _sir_, take a look out the window,\nhuh?\"\n\n\"Much better.\" Drak walked to the window and saw, in the distance, a\nmass of ascending black smoke.\n\n\"City of Chando,\" the corporal said proudly. \"Boy, we smacked it today!\nSaturation bombing for ten hours. They can't use it for anything but a\ngravel pit now!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" Drak reminded.\n\n\"Sir. The planes are fueled up and waiting. What shall we flatten next,\nhuh, sir?\"\n\n\"Let me see....\" General Drak examined a wall map upon which the\nimportant enemy cities were circled in red. There were Alis and Dryn,\nKys and Mos and Dlettre. Drak could think of no reason for leveling one\nmore than another. After a moment's thought, he pushed a button on his\ndesk.\n\n\"Yeah?\" asked a voice over the loudspeaker.\n\n\"Which one, Ingif?\"\n\n\"Kys, of course,\" said the cracked voice of his old hardware store\nassistant. \"Fellow over there owes us money and won't pay up.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Ingif.\" Drak turned to the corporal. \"Go to it, soldier!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\nThe corporal hurried out.\n\nGeneral Drak turned back to the reports on his desk, trying again to\npuzzle out what had happened at Allani. Repulsed Us? Us Repulsed? How\nshould it read?\n\n\"Oh, well,\" Drak said resignedly. \"In the long run, I don't suppose it\nreally makes much difference.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMiles away, in no man's land, stood a bunker of reinforced concrete and\nsteel. Within the bunker were two men. They sat on opposite sides of\na plain wooden table and their faces were stern and impassive. Beside\neach man was a pad and pencil. Upon each pad were marks.\n\nUpon the table between them was a coin.\n\n\"Your toss,\" said the man on the right.\n\nThe man on the left picked up the coin. \"Call it.\"\n\n\"Heads.\"\n\nIt came up heads.\n\n\"Damn,\" said the flipper, passing the coin across the table and\nstanding up.\n\nThe other man smiled faintly, but said nothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKelly reached for the kissoff switch, then hesitated. \"Look, Igor,\" he\nsaid, \"do we have to come out now, without charts? It gets risky, you\nknow. How can we tell what's out there in normal space?\"\n\n\"It is a risk we have to take,\" Beliakoff said stonily.\n\n\"But why? What's wrong with the people of Mala having those books?\nBelieve me, there's nothing dirty in them.\"\n\n\"Look,\" Beliakoff said patiently, \"you know that Mala is a\nsemi-restricted planet. Limited trading is allowed under control\nconditions. No articles are allowed on the planet except those on the\napproved list.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Kelly said vaguely. \"Silly sort of rule.\"\n\n\"Not at all. Mala is a mirror culture. They consider Earth and its ways\nto be absolute perfection. They copy everything of Earth's they can\nfind.\"\n\n\"Seems like a good idea. We _have_ got a real good culture.\"\n\n\"Sure, but we developed into it. The Malans simply copy what they see,\nwith no underlying tradition or rationale. Since they don't know why\nthey're doing any particular thing, they can easily misinterpret it,\nwarp it into something harmful.\"\n\n\"They'll learn,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"Of course they will. But in the meantime, the results can be\ndevastating. They always are when a primitive race tries to ape the\nculture of a more advanced people. Look at what happened to the South\nSea Islanders. All they picked up was the worst of French, British and\nAmerican culture. You hardly see any more South Sea Islanders, do you?\nSame with the American Indians, with the Hottentots, and plenty of\nothers.\"\n\n\"I still think you're making too much of a fuss about it,\" Kelly\nsaid. \"All right, I gave them a lot of books on warfare and political\norganization. So what? What in blazes can they do with them?\"\n\n\"The Malans,\" Beliakoff said grimly, \"have never had a war.\"\n\nKelly gulped. \"Never?\"\n\n\"Never. They're a completely cooperative society. Or were, before they\nstarted reading those warfare books.\"\n\n\"But they wouldn't start a war just because they've got some books on\nit, and know that Earth people do it, and--yeah, I guess they would.\"\nQuickly he set the dials. \"You're right, buddy. We have an absolute\nmoral obligation to return and straighten out that mess.\"\n\n\"I knew you'd see it that way,\" Beliakoff said approvingly. \"And\nthere is the additional fact that the Galactic Council could hold\nus responsible for any deaths traceable to the books. It could mean\nRan-hachi Prison for a hundred years or so.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you say that in the first place?\" Kelly flipped the kissoff\nswitch. The ship came out in normal space. Fortunately, there was no\nsun or planet in its path.\n\n\"Hang on,\" Kelly said, \"we're going where we're going in a great big\nrush!\"\n\n\"I just hope we'll be in time to salvage something,\" Beliakoff said,\nwatching as their freighter plowed its way through the sea of space\ntoward the unchanging stars.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith evident nervousness, Nob walked down a long, dim corridor toward\nthe imperial chambers, carrying a small package in both hands. The\nPrime Minister of the Dictatorship was a small bald man with a great\nbulging forehead and small, glittering black eyes, made smaller by\nsteel-rimmed spectacles. He looked the very incarnation of an evil\ngenius, which was why he had been chosen as the Power Behind the Throne.\n\nIn point of fact, however, Nob was a mild, near-sighted, well-meaning\nlittle man, a lawyer by occupation, known throughout Mala for his\nprize rose gardens and his collection of Earth stamps. In spite of a\ntemperamental handicap, he didn't find his new job too difficult. The\nEarth books were there and Nob simply interpreted them as literally as\npossible. Whenever a problem came up, Nob thought: how would they solve\nit on Earth? Then he would do the same, or as near the same as possible.\n\nBut dealing with the Empress presented problems of a unique nature.\nNob couldn't find a book entitled _Ways and Means of Placating\nRoyalty_. If such a book were obtainable, Nob would have paid any price\nfor it.\n\nHe took a deep breath, knocked and opened the door into the Royal\nChambers.\n\nInstantly he ducked. A vase shattered against the wall behind him. Not\nso good, he thought, calculating the distance by which it had missed\nhim. The Empress Jusa's aim was improving.\n\n\"Nob, you dirty swine!\" the Empress shrieked.\n\n\"At your service, Majesty,\" Nob answered, bowing low.\n\n\"Where are the pearls, you insolent dolt?\"\n\n\"Here, Majesty,\" Nob said, handing over the package. \"It strained the\nexchequer, buying them for you. The Minister of the Treasury threatened\nto desert to the enemy. He may still. The people are muttering about\nextravagance in high places. But the pearls are yours, Majesty.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" Jusa opened the package and looked at the lustrous gems.\n\"Can I keep them?\" she asked, in a very small voice.\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\n\"I didn't think so,\" Jusa said sadly. She had been just another Malan\ngirl, but had been chosen as Empress on the basis of her looks, which\nwere heartbreakingly lovely. It was axiomatic that an Empress should be\nheartbreakingly lovely. The Malans had seen enough Earth films to know\nthat.\n\nBut an Empress should also be cold, calculating, cruel, as well as\ngracious, headstrong and generous to a fault. She should care nothing\nfor her people, while, simultaneously, all she cared for was the\npeople. She should act in a manner calculated to make her subjects love\nher in spite of and because of herself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJusa was a girl of considerable intelligence and she wanted to be as\nEarthly as the next. But the contradictions in her role baffled her.\n\n\"Can't I keep them just for a little while?\" she pleaded, holding a\nsingle pearl up to the light.\n\n\"It isn't possible,\" Nob said. \"We need guns, tanks, planes. Therefore\nyou sell your jewelry. There are many Terran precedents.\"\n\n\"But why did I have to insist upon the pearls in the first place?\" Jusa\nasked.\n\n\"I explained! As Empress, you must be flighty, must possess a whim of\niron, must have no regard for anyone else's feelings, must lust for\nexpensive baubles.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Jusa said.\n\n\"All right, what?\"\n\n\"All right, swine.\"\n\n\"That's better,\" Nob said. \"You're learning, Jusa, you really are. If\nyou could just fluctuate your moods more consistently--\"\n\n\"I really will try,\" promised the Empress. \"I'll learn, Nob. You'll be\nproud of me yet.\"\n\n\"Good. Now there are some problems of state which you must decide upon.\nPrisoners of war, for one thing. We have several possible means for\ndisposing of them. First, we could--\"\n\n\"You take care of it.\"\n\n\"Now, now,\" Nob chided. \"Mustn't shirk your duty.\"\n\n\"I'm not. I am simply being arbitrary and dictatorial. _You_ solve it,\npig. And bring me diamonds.\"\n\n\"Yes, Excellency,\" Nob said, bowing low. \"Diamonds. But the people--\"\n\n\"I love the people. But to hell with them!\" she cried, fire in her eyes.\n\n\"Fine, fine,\" Nob said, and bowed his way out of the room.\n\nJusa stood for a few moments in thought, then picked up a vase and\nshattered it on the floor. She made a mental note to order several\ndozen more.\n\nThen she flung herself upon the royal couch and began to weep bitterly.\n\nShe was quite a young Empress and she had the feeling of being in\nbeyond her depth. The problems of the war and of royalty had completely\nended her social life.\n\nShe resented it; any girl would.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNob, meanwhile, left the palace and went home in his armored car.\nThe car had been ordered to protect him against assassins, who,\naccording to the Earth books, aimed a good deal of their plots at\nPrime Ministers. Nob could see no reason for this, since if he weren't\nPrime Minister, any one of a thousand men could do the job with equal\nefficiency. But he supposed it had a certain symbolic meaning.\n\nHe reached his home and his wife kissed him on the cheek. \"Hard day at\nthe palace, dear?\" she asked.\n\n\"Quite hard,\" Nob said. \"Lots of work for after supper.\"\n\n\"It just isn't fair,\" complained his wife. She was a plump, pleasant\nlittle person and she worried continually about her husband's health.\n\"They shouldn't make you work so hard.\"\n\n\"But of course they should!\" said Nob, a little astonished. \"Don't\nyou remember what I told you? All the books say that during a war, a\nPrime Minister is a harried, harassed individual, weighed down by the\nenormous burden of state, unable to relax, tense with the numerous\nstrains of high office.\"\n\n\"It isn't fair,\" his wife repeated.\n\n\"No one said it was. But it's extremely Earthlike.\"\n\nHis wife shrugged her shoulders. \"Well, of course, if it's Earthlike,\nit must be right. Come eat supper, dear.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter eating, Nob attacked his mounds of paperwork. But soon he was\nyawning and his eyes burned. He turned to his wife, who was just\nfinishing the dishes.\n\n\"My dear,\" he said, \"do you suppose you could help me?\"\n\n\"Is it proper?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, absolutely. The books state that the Prime Minister's wife tries\nin every way possible to relieve her husband of the burden of power.\"\n\n\"In that case, I'll be happy to try.\" She sat down in front of the\ngreat pile of papers. \"But, dear, I don't know anything about these\nmatters.\"\n\n\"Rely on instinct,\" Nob answered, yawning. \"That's what I do.\"\n\nFlattered by the importance of her task, she set to work with a will.\n\nSeveral hours later, she awakened her husband, who was slumbering on\nthe couch.\n\n\"I've got them all finished except these,\" she said. \"In this one, I'm\nafraid I don't understand that word.\"\n\nNob glanced at the paper. \"Oh, propaganda. That means giving the people\nthe facts, whether true or false. It's very important in any war.\"\n\n\"I don't see why.\"\n\n\"It's obvious. To have a genuine Earth-style war, you need ideological\ndifferences. That's why we chose a dictatorship and the other continent\nchose a democracy. The job of propaganda is to keep us different.\"\n\n\"I see,\" she said dubiously. \"Well, this other paper is from General\nHeglm of Security. He asks what you are doing about the spy situation.\nHe says it's very serious.\"\n\n\"I had forgotten about that. He's right, it's reached a crisis point.\"\nHe put the paper in his pocket. \"I'm going to take care of that\npersonally, first thing in the morning.\"\n\nIn the last few hours, his wife had made no less than eight Major\nPolicy Decisions, twenty Codifications, eight Unifications, and three\nClarifications. Nob didn't bother to read them over. He trusted his\nwife's good judgment and common sense.\n\nHe went to bed that night with the feeling of a job well done. And\nbefore he fell asleep, he figured out exactly what he would do about\nthe spy situation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning, Nob's orders went out by all means of communication.\nThe results were gratifyingly swift, since the people of the\ndictatorship were completely behind the war and dutifully loved and\nhated their Empress, in whose name the order was signed.\n\nA typical scene took place in the clubcar of the Char-Xil express. The\noccupants of the car, twenty-three commuting businessmen, sealed the\ndoors as soon as they received Nob's order. The best-read among them, a\nsalesman by the name of Thrang, was elected spokesman for the group.\n\n\"Boys,\" said Thrang, \"I guess I don't have to tell you anything about\nthe importance of this order. We all know what war is by now, don't we?\"\n\n\"We sure do!\"\n\n\"War is hell!\"\n\n\"The war that the enemy thrust on us!\"\n\n\"The war to start all wars!\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Thrang said. \"And I guess we've all felt the pinch\nsince the war started. Eh, boys?\"\n\n\"I've done my part,\" said a man named Draxil. \"When the Prime Minister\ncalled for a cigarette shortage, I dumped twenty carloads of tobacco in\nthe Hunto River. Now we got cigarette rationing!\"\n\n\"That's the spirit,\" Thrang said. \"I know for a fact that others among\nyou have done the same with sugar, canned goods, butter, meat and a\nhundred items. Everything's rationed now; everyone feels the pinch.\nBut, boys, there's still more we have to do. Now a spy situation has\ncome up and it calls for quick action.\"\n\n\"Haven't we done enough?\" groaned a clothing-store owner.\n\n\"It's never enough! In time of war, Earth people give till it\nhurts--then give some more! They know that no sacrifice is too much,\nthat nothing counts but the proper prosecution of the war.\"\n\nThe clothing-store owner nodded vehemently. \"If it's Earthly, it's good\nenough for me. So what can we do about this spy situation?\"\n\n\"That is for us to decide here and now,\" Thrang said. \"According to the\nPrime Minister, our dictatorship cannot boast a single act of espionage\nor sabotage done to it since the beginning of the war. The Chief of\nSecurity is alarmed. It's his job to keep all spies under surveillance.\nSince there are none, his department has lost all morale, which, in\nturn, affects the other departments.\"\n\n\"Do we really need spies?\"\n\n\"They serve a vital purpose,\" Thrang explained. \"All the books agree\non this. Spies keep a country alert, on its toes, eternally vigilant.\nThrough sabotage, they cut down on arms production, which otherwise\nwould grow absurdly large, since it has priority over everything else.\nThey supply Security with subjects for Interrogation, Confession,\nBrainwashing and Re-indoctrination. This in turn supplies data for\nthe enemy propaganda machine, which in turn supplies material for our\ncounter-propaganda machine.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDraxil looked awed. \"I didn't know it was so complicated.\"\n\n\"That's the beauty of the Earth War,\" Thrang said. \"Stupendous yet\ndelicate complications, completely interrelated. Leave out one\nseemingly unimportant detail and the whole structure collapses.\"\n\n\"Those Terrans!\" Draxil said, shaking his head in admiration.\n\n\"Now to work. Boys, I'm calling for volunteers. Who'll be a spy?\"\n\nNo one responded.\n\n\"Really now!\" said Thrang. \"That's no attitude to take. Come on, some\nof you must be harboring treasonous thoughts. Don't be ashamed of it.\nRemember, it takes all kinds to make a war.\"\n\nLittle Herg, a zipper salesman from Xcoth, cleared his throat. \"I have\na cousin who's Minister of War for the Allies.\"\n\n\"An excellent motive for subversion!\" Thrang cried.\n\n\"I rather thought it was,\" the zipper salesman said, pleased. \"Yes, I\nbelieve I can handle the job.\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" Thrang said.\n\nBy then, the train had arrived at the station. The doors were unsealed,\nallowing the commuters to leave for their jobs. Thrang watched the\nzipper salesman depart, then hurried into the crowd. In a moment, he\nfound a tall man wearing a slouch hat and dark glasses. On his lapel\nwas a silver badge which read _Secret Police_.\n\n\"See that man?\" Thrang asked, pointing to the zipper salesman.\n\n\"You bet,\" the Secret Policeman said.\n\n\"He's a spy! A dirty spy! Quick, after him!\"\n\n\"He's being watched,\" said the Secret Policeman laconically.\n\n\"I just wanted to make sure,\" Thrang said, and started to walk off.\n\nHe felt a heavy hand on his shoulder. He turned. The Secret Policeman\nhad been joined by two tall men in slouch hats and dark glasses. They\nwore badges that said _Storm Troopers_.\n\n\"You're under arrest,\" said the Secret Policeman.\n\n\"Why? What have I done?\"\n\n\"Not a thing, as far as we know,\" said a Storm Trooper. \"Not a single\nsolitary thing. That's why we're arresting you.\"\n\n\"Arbitrary police powers,\" the Secret Policeman explained. \"Suspension\nof search warrants and habeas corpus. Invasion of privacy. War, you\nknow. Come along quietly, sir. You have a special and very important\npart to play in the war effort.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"You have been arbitrarily selected as Martyr,\" said the Secret\nPoliceman.\n\nHead held high, Thrang marched proudly to his destiny.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe whole of Mala took to war with a will. Soon books began to appear\non the stalls: _War and You_ for the masses, _The Erotic Release of\nWar_ for the elite, _The Inherent Will to Destroy_ for philosophers,\nand _War and Civilization_ for scholars. Volumes of personal\nexperiences sold well. Among them was an account of daring sabotage by\na former zipper salesman, and the dramatic story of the Martyrdom of\nThrang.\n\nWar eliminated a thousand old institutions and unburdened the people of\nthe heavy hand of tradition. War demonstrated clearly that everything\nwas as temporary as a match-flash except Art and Man, because cities,\nbuildings, parks, vehicles, hills, museums, monuments were as whispers\nof dust after the bombers had gone.\n\nAmong the proletariat, the prevailing opinion was voiced by Zun, who\nwas quoted as saying at a war plant party, \"Well, there ain't nothin'\nin the stores I can buy. But I never made so much money in my life!\"\n\nIn the universities, professors boned up on the subject in order to fit\nthemselves for Chairs of War that were sure to be endowed. All they had\nto do was wait until the recent crop of war profiteers were taxed into\nbecoming philanthropists, or driven to it by the sense of guilt that\nthe books assured them they would feel.\n\nArmies grew. Soldiers learned to paint, salute, curse, appreciate home\ncooking, play poker, and fit themselves in every way for the post-war\ncivilian life. They broadened themselves with travel and got a welcome\nvacation from home and hearth.\n\nWar, the Malans agreed, was certainly one of the cleverest of Earth\ninstitutions and as educational as it was entertaining.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Nope,\" Beliakoff was saying, \"you wouldn't like Ran-hachi Prison, not\none little bit. It's on Mercury, you know, in the twilight zone. You\nblister by day and you freeze by night. Only two men have escaped from\nRan-hachi in the last hundred years, and one of them figured his curve\nwrong and flipped into Sol.\"\n\n\"What about the other one?\" Kelly asked, perspiring lightly.\n\n\"His gyros fused. He was bound straight for the Coal Sack. Take him\na couple of thousand years to get there, at his speed,\" Beliakoff\nfinished dreamily. \"No, Johnny, you wouldn't like Ran-hachi.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay,\" Kelly said. \"The death penalty would be better.\"\n\n\"They give that only as a measure of extreme clemency,\" Beliakoff said\nwith gloomy Slavic satisfaction.\n\n\"Enough! We'll straighten out Mala.\" There was more hope than\nconviction in Kelly's voice. \"Thar she lies, off to starboard.\"\n\nMala was a tiny blue and brown sphere, suddenly growing larger in their\nscreens.\n\nTheir radio blared on the emergency channel.\n\nKelly swore. \"That's the Galactic patrol boat from Azolith. What's he\ndoing here?\"\n\n\"Blockade,\" said Beliakoff. \"Standard practice to quarantine a planet\nat war. We can't touch down legally until the war's declared over.\"\n\n\"Nuts. We're going down.\" Kelly touched the controls and the freighter\nbegan to descend into the interdicted area.\n\n\"Attention, freighter!\" the radio blasted. \"This is the interdictory\nship _Moth_. Heave to and identify yourself.\"\n\nBeliakoff answered promptly in the Propendium language. \"Let's see 'em\nunscramble _that_,\" he said to Kelly. They continued their descent.\n\nAfter a while, a voice from the patrol boat said in Propendium,\n\"Attention, freighter! You are entering an interdicted area. Heave to\nat once and prepare to be boarded.\"\n\n\"I can't understand your vile North Propendium accent,\" Beliakoff\nbellowed, in a broad South Propendium dialect. \"If you people can't\nspeak a man's language, don't clutter up the ether with your ridiculous\nchatter. I know you long-haul trampers and I'll be damned if I'll give\nyou any air, water, food, or anything else. If you can't stock that\nstuff like any normal, decent--\"\n\n\"This area is interdicted,\" the patrol boat broke in, speaking now with\na broad South Propendium accent.\n\n\"Hell,\" Beliakoff grumbled. \"They've got themselves a robot linguist.\"\n\n\"--under direct orders from the patrol boat _Moth_. Heave to at once,\nfreighter, and prepare to be boarded and inspected.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeliakoff glanced at the planet looming large beneath them. He gestured\nat the power control to Kelly and said, \"Hello! Hello! Do you read me?\nYour message is not coming across. Do you read me?\"\n\n\"Stop or we'll fire!\"\n\nBeliakoff nodded. Kelly kicked in all the jets and they plummeted\ntoward the surface. With his pilot's sixth sense, Kelly changed course\nabruptly. A blast seared past them, sealing a starboard tube for\ngood. Then they were in the atmosphere, traveling too fast, the hull\nglowing red with friction. The heavy cruiser, built only for spatial\nmaneuvering, broke off its pursuit curve.\n\n\"All right, freighter. This means your license. You gotta leave\nsometime.\"\n\nBeliakoff shut off the radio. Kelly fired the braking jets and began to\nspiral in for a landing.\n\nAs they circled, Beliakoff saw the shattered rubble and ruin where\ncities had been. He saw highways filled with military columns, and, at\nthe distant edge of the horizon, a fleet of military planes winging\ntheir way to a fresh target.\n\n\"What a mess!\" he said. Kelly nodded glumly.\n\nThey touched down and opened the hatches. Already a crowd of Malans had\ngathered. A few artists had set up their easels and were busy painting\nthe freighter, not because it was lovely, but because it was Terran,\nwhich was better.\n\nA Malan stepped forward, grinning. \"Well,\" he asked, \"what do you\nthink of it?\"\n\n\"Of what?\"\n\n\"Our war, of course. You must have noticed!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, we noticed,\" Beliakoff said.\n\n\"A real intercontinental war complete with ideological differences,\"\nthe man stated proudly. \"Just like the civilized planets have. You must\nadmit it's Earthlike.\"\n\n\"Exceedingly Earthlike,\" Kelly said. \"Now take us to whoever's in\ncharge--quick!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe conference with Nob at the Imperial Palace began well. The Prime\nMinister was overjoyed that real Earthmen had come to witness their\nwar. He knew very well that, by Earth standards, it was a pretty small\nwar. A beginner's war, really. But they were trying. Some day, with\nmore know-how, with better equipment, they would be able to produce a\nwar that would match anyone's.\n\n\"We were hampered from the start,\" Nob apologized, \"by not knowing how\nto produce atomic fission.\"\n\n\"That must have been confining,\" Kelly said, and Beliakoff winced.\n\n\"It was. Dynamite and nitroglycerin just don't have the same grandeur\nand finality. The scale of demolition seems insignificant. But if you\nwill come with me, gentlemen, I have something here which may interest\nyou.\"\n\nNob ushered the Earthmen ahead of him so he could copy their\nloose-jointed, rolling walk.\n\n\"Here!\" he said, darting ahead and opening a door. \"Behold!\"\n\nThe Earthmen saw, upon an ivory pedestal, a small model of an atomic\nbomb.\n\n\"We worked until we mastered it at last,\" Nob said proudly. \"With any\nluck, we'll be in production within the month and using them within the\nyear. Now I think I can safely say that Mala has come of age!\"\n\nBeliakoff said, \"No.\"\n\n\"No, what?\"\n\n\"No atom bombs.\"\n\n\"But it's Earthlike to use atomic bombs. Why--\"\n\n\"This war has to end at once,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"You're joking!\" protested Nob, looking intently at the Earthmen. But\nhe saw at once that they were deadly serious. He groaned and sat down.\n\nNob was faced with a moral dilemma of fearful proportions. On the one\nhand, war was a typical Terran institution, an extremely important one,\nan institution clearly worthy of emulation by the people of Mala. But\non the other hand, this Terran institution was being refuted, denied,\nin fact, by two typical Terrans.\n\nThe problem was insoluble for him. And Nob remembered that, when\nan ultimate crisis is at hand, that is the moment for the supreme\nauthority to step in.\n\n\"We must discuss this with the Empress,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe led them to Jusa's chambers, knocked and opened the door. Half a\ndozen vases shattered around them.\n\n\"On your knees, pigs!\" Jusa shrilled. \"You, Nob, have you brought the\ndiamonds?\"\n\n\"I knew I forgot something.\"\n\n\"Forgot them! Then how dare you show your face?\" Jusa stamped her small\nfoot. \"And these peasants--who are they? I've a good mind to lock them\nup, especially that grinning red-headed ape.\"\n\nKelly's grin became a trifle strained.\n\n\"These are _Earthmen_, Your Majesty,\" Nob said. \"Genuine Earthmen!\"\n\n\"Really?\" breathed Jusa.\n\n\"Really,\" said Nob.\n\n\"Oh, golly,\" Jusa said, losing all her painfully acquired imperial pose\nand becoming a frightened, albeit lovely, young girl.\n\n\"Your Majesty--\" Beliakoff began.\n\n\"Just call me Jusa. My gosh! Real Earthmen! I never met a real\nEarthman before. I wish you had let me know in advance. My hair--\"\n\n\"Is beautiful, just like yourself,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"I'm so glad. I think _your_ hair is beautiful, too.\"\n\nKelly turned brick-red. \"You're not supposed to say that, you know.\"\n\n\"I _didn't_ know,\" Jusa said. \"But I'm willing to learn. What should I\nhave--\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" Beliakoff broke in sourly. \"Your Majesty, we've come to\nask you to stop the war.\"\n\n\"You don't mean it!\" Jusa turned bewilderedly to Kelly.\n\n\"Have to do it, honey,\" Kelly said softly. \"You folks just aren't ready\nfor a war yet.\"\n\nJusa's eyes flashed and she began to regain a little of her imperial\npose. \"But of course we are! Look at what we've done. Go over our\nbattlefields, look at our cities, interrogate our refugees. You'll find\nthat everything has been done in strict accordance with the rules.\nWe're as ready for war as anyone!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, you'll have to stop it,\" Beliakoff said, and Kelly nodded\nhis agreement.\n\nJusa gave Nob a beseeching look, but the Prime Minister averted\nhis eyes. The dilemma was there again, enormous, insurmountable,\nand squarely on Jusa's shoulders. To stop the war now would be\nUnearthlike; to refuse the Earthmen was unthinkable.\n\n\"I just don't know,\" Jusa said. She looked at Kelly, who wore the\nguilty expression of a man caught murdering a fawn. Then she burst into\ntears and collapsed on a couch.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNob and the Earthmen looked at each other, made several helpless\ngestures, and left.\n\n\"What now?\" Beliakoff asked, in the corridor. \"Do you think she'll stop\nthe war?\"\n\nNob shrugged his shoulders. \"Who knows? It's a problem without a\nsolution.\"\n\n\"But she has to make up her mind,\" Kelly said. \"That's one of the\nduties of authority.\"\n\n\"The Empress is aware of that. And she _will_ make up her mind, though\nit could take a year or more. Unless she fails completely under the\nstrain.\"\n\n\"Poor kid,\" Kelly said. \"She needs a man to help her out.\"\n\n\"Indeed she does,\" Nob agreed hastily. \"A strong man, a wise man, a man\nwho could guide her and be as adviser and husband to her.\"\n\nKelly blinked, then laughed nervously. \"Don't look at me! I mean she's\na cute kid, nice girl, make some man a wonderful wife, but I'm not the\nmarrying kind, you know what I mean?\"\n\n\"Johnny,\" said Beliakoff, \"I'd like to have a serious talk with you.\"\n\nNob led them to a vacant room and left discreetly.\n\n\"I won't do it!\" Kelly declared bluntly.\n\n\"You have to,\" Beliakoff said. \"You got us into this mess. Now you can\nmarry us out.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"She'd make a wonderful wife,\" Beliakoff quoted Kelly's words back at\nhim. \"Docile, pretty, but spirited. What more could you ask?\"\n\n\"Freedom of choice,\" Kelly said grimly.\n\n\"That's for adolescents.\"\n\n\"Speaking.\"\n\n\"She'll never be able to make up her mind to stop the war unless you\nmarry her. Until the war ends, that interdictory ship is going to sit\nin orbit, waiting for us. You haven't anything to lose,\" Beliakoff\nadded.\n\n\"I haven't?\"\n\n\"Not a thing. It's a big galaxy and our freighter is always waiting.\"\n\n\"That's true....\" Kelly admitted.\n\nTen minutes later, Beliakoff dragged him into the corridor. They were\njoined by Nob, who ushered them back to the Empress's chambers.\n\n\"It's okay by me if it's okay by you, kid,\" Kelly blurted out, in\na tone that made Beliakoff shudder and made Nob smile in outright\nhero-worship.\n\n\"What is all right?\" Jusa asked.\n\n\"Marriage,\" Kelly said. \"What d'ya say?\"\n\nJusa studied his face for several seconds. \"But do you love me?\"\n\n\"Give it time, kid! Give it time!\"\n\nJusa must have seen something in his expression, something behind the\nembarrassment and anger. Very softly she said, \"I will be most happy to\nmarry you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a double-ring ceremony and authentically Terran. Beliakoff\nproduced a Bible from the freighter and the ancient words of the Earth\nceremony were read. When it was over, Kelly, grinning, perspiring,\nnervously rubbing his hands together, turned to his bride.\n\n\"Now stop the war, honey.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" Jusa said dutifully. She heaved a great sigh.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Kelly asked.\n\n\"I just tremble to think of our cities being bombed out of existence\nand us not able to do anything about it because we've stopped fighting.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about? If we stop fighting--\"\n\n\"_They_ won't!\" she said. \"Why should they? It's Earthlike to continue\nconquering, and if we quit fighting, there'll be nothing to stop them\nfrom conquering us completely.\"\n\n\"Nob!\" Kelly shouted. \"Igor! What can we do about this?\"\n\nNob said, \"There would appear to be only one certain solution. I can\narrange a meeting for you--\" he turned to Beliakoff--\"with Lanvi, the\nPresident of the Allies.\"\n\n\"What would I say to him?\" asked Beliakoff.\n\n\"To her,\" Nob corrected. \"You can say, I suppose, the same sort of\nthing your friend said.\"\n\nBeliakoff, ashy pale, started to back away. Kelly caught him in one\nmeaty fist. \"Okay, Mr. Fixer. Your duty is plain. Marry us out of\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"But I've got a girl friend in Minsk--\"\n\n\"She forgot you years ago. Stop squirming, buddy.\"\n\n\"What does she look like?\" Beliakoff queried in apprehension.\n\n\"_Very_ pretty,\" Nob said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the double-ring ceremony, Beliakoff peered at his bride with\ncautious approval. Lanvi was indeed a pretty girl and she seemed to\npossess the Malan virtues of obedience, patience and fire.\n\nAs soon as the final words were spoken, the war was declared officially\nover. Peace, an authentic Earth custom, was proclaimed.\n\n\"Now the real work begins,\" Beliakoff said. \"First, we'll need a list\nof the casualties.\"\n\n\"The what?\" Nob asked.\n\n\"Casualties.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure I understand,\" said the Prime Minister.\n\n\"Casualties! The number of people killed in the warfare.\"\n\n\"Now wait a moment,\" Nob said, his voice trembling. \"Do I understand\nyou correctly? Are you trying to tell me that civilized people kill\npeople in their wars? _Do you mean that they leave people in the cities\nthey bomb?_\"\n\nKelly looked at Beliakoff. Beliakoff looked at Kelly.\n\n\"Lord, Lord,\" murmured Kelly.\n\nBeliakoff merely gulped.\n\n\"Is it possible?\" asked Nob. \"Do civilized people really--\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Beliakoff.\n\n\"Never,\" Kelly said.\n\nNob pursed his lips. \"I've been wanting to ask a real authority, a\ngenuine Earthman, some questions on the subject. Our texts were by no\nmeans complete and some parts we couldn't understand at all. Like the\nmatter of determining victories. That's something we couldn't figure\nout. We decided you must use a complicated system of umpires. It was\ntoo much for us, so we built a bunker in no man's land and put a man\nfrom each side in it. They tossed coins to determine whose turn it was.\nThe winning side would bomb an enemy city. After the occupants had\nbeen evacuated, of course.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Beliakoff.\n\n\"It worked out rather well with the coins,\" Nob said. \"Law of averages,\nin fact.\"\n\n\"Substantially our system,\" said Kelly.\n\n\"Just the way we do it,\" Beliakoff added.\n\n\"A few more questions, if you please,\" Nob said. \"Jusa, would you bring\nin the big _War Encyclopedia_?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJusa and Lanvi had been gossiping on the other side of the room. They\nhurried out and returned with the great book.\n\n\"Now here,\" Nob said, opening the volume, \"it seems to imply--\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Beliakoff broke in. He took the book from Nob's hands and\nflipped through it rapidly, then turned to Kelly. In a whisper, he said\nin Propendium, \"It looks as though Kyne blotted out all references to\nkilling.\"\n\n\"Sure!\" exclaimed Kelly, brightening. \"I told you he was a\nhemophiliac--a bleeder. Naturally, he'd cut out every single mention of\nbloodshed!\"\n\n\"This point--\" Nob began.\n\n\"Later,\" Beliakoff said. \"Right now, we'd like to get a few articles\nfrom our spaceship.\" He winked at Kelly, who winked back. \"It won't\ntake a moment and then we'll be only too happy to--\"\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" said Nob. \"You mean you _wanted_ the spaceship?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Well, I assumed that you'd have no further use for it. Metal is hard\nto get nowadays and it seemed only proper to erect heroic statues to\nboth of you, the men who brought the institution of peace to Mala. Did\nI do something wrong?\"\n\n\"Not at all, not at all,\" Kelly said. \"Oh, not at all. Perfectly\ndelighted. Not at--\"\n\n\"Johnny!\" said Beliakoff.\n\n\"Sorry,\" Kelly apologized, a broken man.\n\nThe brides stepped forward to claim their husbands.\n\nPeace and prosperity came to Mala, under the deft guidance of their\nTerran leaders. In time, spaceships arrived and departed, but neither\nman showed any particular desire to board one, for their wives--docile,\npatient, yet fiery--proved more appealing than the lonely far reaches\nof space.\n\nBeliakoff sometimes pondered the opportune melting down of their\nfreighter. He was never able to discover who had signed the order. But\nall Mala knew the saying, \"An Earthman is easy to catch, but hard to\nhold.\" He wondered whether that had been the true reason behind the\norder to scrap the ship.\n\nBy this time, of course, he didn't really care; if his wife or Kelly's\nhad been responsible, it was all the more reason to feel appreciated.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNob knew the answer, but he had other things on his mind. He lay awake,\nrestless, until his wife asked worriedly what was wrong.\n\n\"I've been wondering,\" he said. \"Those war books that the Earthmen had\nus turn in--I never did understand why all those deletions were made.\nYou know, the ones that made us figure out a way of deciding which side\nwon.\"\n\n\"But the Earthmen said they used the very same system,\" she reminded\nhim. \"And they wouldn't lie, would they?\"\n\n\"They would, if it was for our good. That's what is known as diplomacy,\ndear. Statesmanship. Or politics. Interchangeable terms.\"\n\nShe looked impressed. \"Oh. And?\"\n\n\"I've tried to question the crews of ships that land here. The answers\nare so evasive that I can't help thinking--\"\n\n\"Yes, dear?\" she prompted.\n\n\"--that civilized people actually _kill_ each other in wars.\"\n\nShe turned a shocked face toward him. \"How can you think such a thing?\nWhat would be the advantage?\"\n\n\"Advantage?\" he repeated. Then his expression cleared and he fell back\non his pillow, completely relaxed. \"I hadn't thought of that, dear.\nNone, of course. It would really be _too_ much, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"No question of it, dear,\" she said. \"Now that that's settled, can you\ngo to sleep?\"\n\nThere was no answer. He was already snoring peacefully.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Moral Equivalent, by Kris Neville\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MORAL EQUIVALENT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51449.txt or 51449.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/4/4/51449/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
