Any who are not seated will seat\nthemselves at once. Prepare for take-off acceleration of one and\none-half gravities; that is, everyone will weigh one-half again as much\nas his normal Earth weight for about fifteen minutes. We lift in twenty\nseconds; I will count down the final five seconds.... Five ... Four ...\nThree ... Two ... One ... Lift!\"\n\n    [1] Transcriber's Note: The original read \"will pay attention,\n    please?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe immense vessel rose from her berth; slowly at first, but with\never-increasing velocity; and in the main lounge, where many of the\npassengers had gathered to watch the dwindling Earth, no one moved for\nthe first five minutes. Then a girl stood up.\n\nShe was not a startlingly beautiful girl; no more so than can be seen\nfairly often, of a summer afternoon, on Seaside Beach. Her hair was an\nartificial yellow. Her eyes were a deep, cool blue. Her skin, what could\nbe seen of it--she was wearing breeches and a long-sleeved shirt--was\nlightly tanned. She was only about five-feet-three, and her build was\nnot spectacular. However, every ounce of her one hundred fifteen pounds\nwas exactly where it should have been.\n\nFirst she stood tentatively, flexing her knees and testing her weight.\nThen, stepping boldly out into a clear space, she began to do a\nhigh-kicking acrobatic dance; and went on doing it as effortlessly and\nas rhythmically as though she were on an Earthly stage.\n\n\"You mustn't _do_ that, Miss!\" A stewardess came bustling up. Or,\nrather, not exactly bustling. Very few people, and almost no\nstewardesses, either actually bustle in or really enjoy one point five\ngees. \"You really _must_ resume your seat, Miss. I must insist.... Oh,\nyou're Miss Warner....\"\n\nShe paused.\n\n\"That's right, Barbara Warner. Cabin two eight one.\"\n\n\"But really, Miss Warner, it's regulations, and if you should fall....\"\n\n\"Foosh to regulations, and _pfui_ on 'em. I won't fall. I've been\nwondering, every time out, if I could do a thing, and now I'm going to\nfind out.\"\n\nJackknifing double, she put both forearms flat on the carpet and lifted\nboth legs into the vertical. Then, silver slippers pointing motionlessly\nceilingward, she got up onto her hands and walked twice around a vacant\nchair. She then performed a series of flips that would have done credit\nto a professional acrobat; the finale of which left her sitting calmly\nin the previously empty seat.\n\n\"See?\" she informed the flabbergasted stewardess. \"I _could_ do it, and\nI didn't....\"\n\nHer voice was drowned out in a yell of approval as everybody who could\nclap their hands did so with enthusiasm. \"More!\" \"Keep it up, gal!\" \"Do\nit again!\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't do that to show off!\" Barbara Warner flushed hotly as she\nmet the eyes of the nearby spectators. \"Honestly I didn't--I just _had_\nto know if I could.\" Then, as the applause did not die down, she fairly\nscampered out of the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor one hour before the _Procyon's_ departure from Earth and for three\nhours afterward, First Officer Carlyle Deston, Chief Electronicist, sat\nattentively at his board. He was five feet eight inches tall and weighed\none hundred sixty-two pounds net. Just a little guy, as spacemen go.\nAlthough narrow-waisted and, for his heft, broad-shouldered, he was\nbuilt for speed and maneuverability, not to haul freight.\n\nWatching a hundred lights and half that many instruments, listening to\ntwo phone circuits, one with each ear, and hands moving from switches to\nrheostats to buttons and levers, he was completely informed as to the\ninstant-by-instant status of everything in his department.\n\nAlthough attentive, he was not tense, even during the countdown. The\nonly change was that at the word \"Two\" his right forefinger came to rest\nupon a red button and his eyes doubled their rate of scan. If anything\nin his department had gone wrong, the _Procyon_'s departure would have\nbeen delayed.\n\nAnd again, well out beyond the orbit of the moon, just before the\nstarship's mighty Chaytor engines hurled her out of space as we know it\ninto that unknowable something that is hyperspace, he poised a finger.\nBut Immergence, too, was normal; all the green lights except one went\nout, needles dropped to zero, both phones went dead, all signals\nstopped. He plugged a jack into a socket below the one remaining green\nlight and spoke:\n\n\"Procyon One to Control Six. Flight Eight Four Nine. Subspace Radio Test\nOne. How do you read me, Control Six?\"\n\n\"Control Six to Procyon One. I read you ten and zero. How do you read\nme, Procyon One?\"\n\n\"Ten and zero. Out.\" Deston flipped a toggle and the solitary green\nlight went out.\n\nPerfect signal and zero noise. That was that. From now until\nEmergence--unless something happened--he might as well be a passenger.\nEverything was automatic, unless and until some robot or computer yelled\nfor help. Deston leaned back in his bucket seat and lighted a cigarette.\nHe didn't need to scan the board constantly now; any trouble signal\nwould jump right out at him.\n\nPromptly at Dee plus Three Zero Zero--three hours, no minutes, no\nseconds after departure--his relief appeared.\n\n\"All black, Babe?\" the newcomer asked.\n\n\"As the pit, Eddie. Take over.\" Eddie did so. \"You've picked out your\ngirl friend for the trip, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Not yet. I got sidetracked watching Bobby Warner. She was doing\nhandstands and handwalks and forward and back flips in the lounge--under\none point five gees yet. _Wow!_ And after that all the other women\nlooked like a dime's worth of catmeat. She doesn't stand out too much\nuntil she starts to move, but then--Oh, _brother_!\" Eddie rolled his\neyes, made motions with his hands, and whistled expressively. \"Talk\nabout poetry in motion! Just walking across a stage, she'd bring down\nthe house and stop the show cold in its tracks.\"\n\n\"O. K., O. K., don't blow a fuse,\" Deston said, resignedly. \"I know.\nYou'll love her undyingly; all this trip, maybe. So bring her up, next\nwatch, and I'll give her a gold badge. As usual.\"\n\n\"You ... how _dumb_ can you get?\" Eddie demanded. \"D'you think I'd even\n_try_ to play footsie with _Barbara Warner_?\"\n\n\"You'd play footsie with the Archangel Michael's sister if she'd let\nyou; and she probably would. So who's Barbara Warner?\"\n\nEddie Thompson gazed at his superior pityingly. \"I know you're ten nines\nper cent monk, Babe, but I _did_ think you pulled your nose out of the\nmegacycles often enough to learn a _few_ of the facts of life. Did you\never hear of Warner Oil?\"\n\n\"I think so.\" Deston thought for a moment. \"Found a big new field,\ndidn't they? In South America somewhere?\"\n\n\"Just the biggest on Earth, is all. And not only on Earth. He operates\nin all the systems for a hundred parsecs around, and he never sinks a\ndry hole. Every well he drills is a gusher that blows the rig clear up\ninto the stratosphere. Everybody wonders how he does it. My guess is\nthat his wife's an oil-witch, which is why he lugs his whole family\nalong wherever he goes. Why else would he?\"\n\n\"Maybe he loves her. It happens, you know.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Eddie snorted. \"After twenty years of her? Comet-gas! Anyway,\nwould _you_ have the sublime gall to make passes at Warner Oil's\nheiress, with more millions in her own sock than you've got dimes?\"\n\n\"I don't make passes.\"\n\n\"That's right, you don't. Only at books and tapes, even on ground\nleaves; more fool you. Well, then, would you _marry_ anybody like that?\"\n\n\"Certainly, if I loved....\" Deston paused, thought a moment, then went\non: \"Maybe I wouldn't, either. She'd make me dress for dinner. She'd\nprobably have a live waiter; maybe even a butler. So I guess I wouldn't,\nat that.\"\n\n\"You nor me neither, brother. But _what_ a dish! What a lovely,\nluscious, toothsome _dish_!\" Eddie mourned.\n\n\"You'll be raving about another one tomorrow,\" Deston said, unfeelingly,\nas he turned away.\n\n\"I don't know; but even if I do, _she_ won't be anything like _her_,\"\nEddie said, to the closing door.\n\nAnd Deston, outside the door, grinned sardonically to himself. Before\nhis next watch, Eddie would bring up one of the prettiest girls aboard\nfor a gold badge; the token that would let her--under approved escort,\nof course--go through the Top.\n\nHe himself never went down to the Middle, which was passenger territory.\nThere was nothing there he wanted. He was too busy, had too many\nworthwhile things to do, to waste time that way ... but the hunch was\ngetting stronger and stronger all the time. For the first time in all\nhis three years of deep-space service he felt an overpowering urge to go\ndown into the very middle of the Middle; to the starship's main lounge.\n\nHe knew that his hunches were infallible. At cards, dice, or wheels he\nhad always had hunches and he had always won. That was why he had\nstopped gambling, years before, before anybody found out. He was that\nkind of a man.\n\nApart from the matter of unearned increment, however, he always followed\nhis hunches; but this one he did not like at all. He had been resisting\nit for hours, because he had never visited the lounge and did not want\nto visit it now. But _something_ down there was pulling like a tractor,\nso he went. He didn't go to his cabin; didn't even take off his\nside-arm. He didn't even think of it; the .41 automatic at his hip was\nas much a part of his uniform as his pants.\n\nEntering the lounge, he did not have to look around. She was playing\nbridge, and as eyes met eyes and she rose to her feet a shock-wave swept\nthrough him that made him feel as though his every hair was standing\nstraight on end.\n\n\"Excuse me, please,\" she said to the other three at her table. \"I must\ngo now.\" She tossed her cards down onto the table and walked straight\ntoward him; eyes still holding eyes.\n\nHe backed hastily out into the corridor, and as the door closed behind\nher they went naturally and wordlessly into each other's arms. Lips met\nlips in a kiss that lasted for a long, long time. It was not a\npassionate embrace--passion would come later--it was as though each of\nthem, after endless years of bootless, fruitless longing, had come\nfinally home.\n\n\"Come with me, dear, where we can talk,\" she said, finally; eying with\ndisfavor the half-dozen highly interested spectators.\n\nAnd a couple of minutes later, in cabin two hundred eighty-one, Deston\nsaid: \"So _this_ is why I had to come down into passenger territory. You\ncame aboard at exactly zero seven forty-three.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh.\" She shook her yellow head. \"A few minutes before that. That was\nwhen I read your name in the list of officers on the board. First\nOfficer, Carlyle Deston. I got a tingle that went from the tips of my\ntoes up and out through the very ends of my hair. Nothing like when we\nactually saw each other, of course. We both knew the truth, then. It's\nwonderful that you're so strongly psychic, too.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" he said, thoughtfully. \"All my training has\nbeen based on the axiomatic fact that the map is _not_ the territory.\nPsionics, as I understand it, holds that the map is--practically--the\nterritory, but can't prove it. So I simply don't know _what_ to believe.\nOn one hand, I have had real hunches all my life. On the other, the\nsignal doesn't carry much information. More like hearing a siren when\nyou're driving along a street. You know you have to pull over and stop,\nbut that's all you know. It could be police, fire ambulance--_anything_.\nAnybody with any psionic ability at all ought to do a lot better than\nthat, I should think.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily. You've been fighting it. Ninety-nine per cent of your\nmind doesn't _want_ to believe it; is dead set against it. So it has to\nforce its way through whillions and skillions of ohms of resistance, so\nonly the most powerful stimuli--'maximum signal' in your jargon,\nperhaps?--can get through to you at all.\" Suddenly she giggled like a\nschoolgirl. \"You're either psychic or the biggest wolf in the known\nuniverse, and I know you aren't a wolf. If you hadn't been as psychic as\nI am, you'd've jumped clear out into subspace when a perfectly strange\ngirl attacked you.\"\n\n\"How do you know so much about me?\"\n\n\"I made it a point to. One of the juniors told me you're the only virgin\nofficer in all space.\"\n\n\"That was Eddie Thompson.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\" She nodded brightly.\n\n\"Well, is that bad?\"\n\n\"Anything else but. That is, he thought it was terrible--outrageous--a\nbetrayal of the whole officer caste--but to me it makes everything just\nabsolutely perfect.\"\n\n\"Me, too. How soon can we get married?\"\n\n\"I'd say right now, except....\" She caught her lower lip between her\nteeth and thought. \"No, no 'except'. Right now, or as soon as you can.\nYou can't, without resigning, can you? They'd fire you?\"\n\n\"Don't worry about that,\" he grinned. \"My record is good enough, I\nthink, to get a good ground job. Even if they fire me for not waiting\nuntil we ground, there's lots of jobs. I can support you, sweetheart.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know you can. I wasn't thinking of _that_. You wouldn't _like_ a\nground job.\"\n\n\"What difference does that make?\" he asked, in honest surprise. \"A man\ngrows up. I couldn't have you with me in space, and I'd like that a lot\nless. No, I'm done with space, as of now. But what was that 'except'\nbusiness?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I thought at first I'd tell my parents first--they're both aboard--but\nI decided not to. She'd scream bloody murder and he'd roar like a lion\nand none of it would make me change my mind, so we'll get married\nfirst.\"\n\nHe looked at her questioningly; she shrugged and went on: \"We aren't\nwhat you'd call a happy family. She's been trying to make me marry an\nold goat of a prince and I finally told her to go roll her hoop--to get\na divorce and marry the foul old beast herself. And to consolidate two\nempires, he's been wanting me to marry a multi-billionaire--who is also\na louse and a crumb and a heel. Last week he _insisted_ on it and I blew\nup like an atomic bomb. I told him if I got married a thousand times I'd\npick every one of my husbands myself, without the least bit of help from\neither him or her. I'd keep on finding oil and stuff for him, I said,\nbut that was all....\"\n\n\"_Oil_!\" Deston exclaimed, involuntarily, as everything fell into place\nin his mind. The way she walked; poetry in motion ... the oil-witch ...\ntwo empires ... more millions than he had dimes.... \"Oh, you're Barbara\nWarner, then.\"\n\n\"Why, of course; but my friends call me 'Bobby'. Didn't you--but of\ncourse you didn't--you never read passenger lists. If you did, you'd've\ngot a tingle, too.\"\n\n\"I got plenty of tingle without reading, believe me. However, I never\nexpected to----\"\n\n\"Don't say it, dear!\" She got up and took both his hands in hers. \"I\nknow how you feel. I don't like to let you ruin your career, either, but\n_nothing_ can separate us, now that we've found each other. So I'll tell\nyou this.\" Her eyes looked steadily into his. \"If it bothers you the\nleast bit, later on, I'll give every dollar I own to some foundation or\nother, I swear it.\"\n\nHe laughed shamefacedly as he took her in his arms. \"Since that's the\nway _you_ look at it, it won't bother me a bit.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, you _do_ mean it.\" She snuggled her head down into the curve of\nhis neck. \"I can tell.\"\n\n\"I know you can, sweetheart.\" Then he had another thought, and with\nstrong, deft fingers he explored the muscles of her arms and back. \"But\nthose acrobatics in plus gee--and you're trained down as hard and fine\nas I am, and it's my business to be--how come?\"\n\n\"I majored in Physical Education and I love it. And I'm a Newmartian,\nyou know, so I teach a few courses----\"\n\n\"Newmartian? I've heard--but you aren't a colonial; you're as Terran as\nI am.\"\n\n\"By blood, yes; but I was born on Newmars. Our actual and legal\nresidence has always been there. The tax situation, you know.\"\n\n\"I don't know, no. Taxes don't bother me much. But go ahead. You teach a\nfew courses. In?\"\n\n\"Oh, bars, trapeze, ground-and-lofty tumbling, acrobatics, aerialistics,\nhigh-wire, muscle-control, judo--all that kind of thing.\"\n\n\"Ouch! So if you ever happen to accidentally get mad at me you'll tie me\nright up into a pretzel?\"\n\n\"I doubt it; very seriously. I've tossed lots of two-hundred-pounders\naround, of course, but they were _not_ space officers.\" She laughed\nunaffectedly as she tested his musculature much more professionally and\nmuch more thoroughly than he had tested hers. \"Definitely I couldn't. A\ngood big man can always take a good little one, you know.\"\n\n\"But I'm not big; I'm just a little squirt. You've probably heard what\nthey call me?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I'm going to call you 'Babe', too, and mean it the same way\nthey do. Besides, who wants a man a foot taller than she is and twice as\nbig? You're just _exactly_ the right size!\"\n\n\"That's spreading the good old oil, Bobby, but I'll never tangle with\nyou if I can help it. Buzz-saws are small, too, and sticks of dynamite.\nShall we go hunt up the parson--or should it be a priest? Or a rabbi?\"\n\n\"Even _that_ doesn't make a particle of difference to you.\"\n\n\"Of course not. How could it?\"\n\n\"A parson, please.\" Then, with a bright, quick grin: \"We _have_ got a\nlot to learn about each other, haven't we?\"\n\n\"Some details, of course, but nothing of any importance and we'll have\nplenty of time to learn them.\"\n\n\"And we'll love every second of it. You'll live down here in the Middle\nwith me, won't you, all the time you aren't actually on duty?\"\n\n\"I can't imagine doing anything else,\" and the two set out, arms around\neach other, to find a minister. And as they strolled along:\n\n\"Of course you won't actually _need_ a job, ever, or my money, either.\nYou never even thought of dowsing, did you?\"\n\n\"Dowsing? Oh, that witch stuff. Of course not.\"\n\n\"Listen, darling. All the time I've been touching you I've been learning\nabout you. And you've been learning about me.\"\n\n\"Yes, but----\"\n\n\"No buts, buster. You have really tremendous powers, and they _aren't_\nlatent, either. All you have to do is quit fighting them and _use_ them.\nYou're ever so much stronger and fuller than I am. All I can do at\ndowsing is find water, oil, coal, and gas. I'm no good at all on\nmetals--I couldn't feel gold if I were perched right on the roof of Fort\nKnox; I couldn't feel radium if it were frying me to a crisp. But I'm\n_positive_ that you can tune yourself to anything you want to find.\"\n\nHe didn't believe it, and the argument went on until they reached the\n\"Reverend's\" quarters. Then, of course, it was dropped automatically;\nand the next five days were deliciously, deliriously, ecstatically happy\ndays for them both.\n\n\nII.\n\nAt the time of this chronicle the status of interstellar flight was very\nsimilar to that of intercontinental jet-plane flight in the\nnineteen-sixties. Starships were designed by humanity's best brains;\ncarried every safety device those brains could devise. They were\nmaintained and serviced by ultra-skilled, ultra-trained, ultra-able\ncrews; they were operated by the _creme-de-la-creme_ of manhood. Only a\nman with an extremely capable mind in an extremely capable body could\nbecome an officer of a subspacer.\n\nStatistically, starships were the safest means of transportation ever\nused by man; so safe that Very Important Persons used them regularly,\nunthinkingly, and as a matter of course. Statistically, the starships'\nfatality rate per million passenger-light-years was a small fraction of\nthat of the automobiles' per million passenger-miles. Insurance\ncompanies offered odds of tens of thousands to one that any given\nstar-traveler would return unharmed from any given star-trip he cared to\nmake.\n\nNevertheless, accidents happened. A chillingly large number of lives\nhad, as a total, been lost; and no catastrophe had ever been even\npartially explained. No message of distress or call for help had ever\nbeen received. No single survivor had ever been found; nor any piece of\nwreckage.\n\nAnd on the Great Wheel of Fate the _Procyon_'s number came up.\n\nIn the middle of the night Carlyle Deston came instantaneously\nawake--feeling with his every muscle and with his every square inch of\nskin; listening with all the force he could put into his auditory\nnerves; while deep down in his mind a huge, terribly silent voice\ncontinued to yell: \"DANGER! DANGER! DANGER!\"\n\nIn a very small fraction of a second Carlyle Deston moved--and fast.\nSeizing Barbara by an arm, he leaped out of bed with her.\n\n\"We're abandoning ship--get into this suit--quick!\"\n\n\"But what ... but I've _got_ to dress!\"\n\n\"No time! Snap it up!\" He practically hurled her into her suit; clamped\nher helmet tight. Then he leaped into his own. \"Skipper!\" he snapped\ninto the suit's microphone. \"Deston. Emergency! Abandon ship!\"\n\nThe alarm bells clanged once; the big red lights flashed once; the\nsirens barely started to growl, then quit. The whole vast fabric of the\nship trembled and shuddered and shook as though it were being mauled by\na thousand impossibly gigantic hammers. Deston did not know and never\ndid find out whether it was his captain or an automatic that touched off\nthe alarm. Whichever it was, the disaster happened so fast that\npractically no warning at all was given. And out in the corridor:\n\n\"Come on, girl--sprint!\" He put his arm under hers and urged her along.\n\nShe did her best, but in comparison with his trained performance her\nbest wasn't good. \"I've never been checked out on sprinting in\nspacesuits!\" she gasped. \"Let go of me and go on ahead. I'll follow----\"\n\nEverything went out. Lights, gravity, air-circulation--everything.\n\n\"You haven't been checked out on free fall, either. Hang onto this\ntool-hanger here on my belt and we'll travel.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Where to?\" she asked, hurtling through the air much faster than she had\never gone on foot.\n\n\"Baby Two--that is, Lifecraft Number Two--my crash assignment. Good\nthing I was down here in the Middle; I'd never have made it from up Top.\nNext corridor left, I think.\" Then, as the light of his headlamp showed\nnumbers on the wall: \"Yes. Square left. I'll swing you.\"\n\nHe swung her and they shot to the end of the passage. He kicked a lever\nand the lifecraft's port swung open--to reveal a blaze of light and a\nstartled, gray-haired man.\n\n\"What happened.... What hap ...?\" the man began.\n\n\"Wrecked. We've had it. We're abandoning ship. Get into that cubby over\nthere, shut the door tight behind you, and _stay there_!\"\n\n\"But can't I do something to help?\"\n\n\"Without a suit and not knowing how to use one? You'd get burned to a\ncinder. Get in there--and _jump_!\"\n\nThe oldster jumped and Deston turned to his wife. \"Stay here at the\nport, Bobby. Wrap one leg around that lever, to anchor you. What does\nyour telltale read? That gauge there--your radiation meter. It reads\ntwenty, same as mine. Just pink, so we've got a minute or so. I'll roust\nout some passengers and toss 'em to you--you toss 'em along in there.\nCan do?\"\n\nShe was white and trembling; she was very evidently on the verge of\nbeing violently sick; but she was far from being out of control. \"Can\ndo, sir.\"\n\n\"Good girl, sweetheart. Hang on one minute more and we'll have gravity\nand you'll be O. K.\"\n\nThe first five doors he tried were locked; and, since they were made of\narmor plate, there was nothing he could do about them except give each\none a resounding kick with a heavy steel boot. The sixth was unlocked,\nbut the passengers--a man and a woman--were very evidently and very\ngruesomely dead.\n\nSo was everyone else he could find until he came to a room in which a\nman in a spacesuit was floundering helplessly in the air. He glanced at\nhis telltale. Thirty-two. High in the red, almost against the pin.\n\n\"Bobby! What do you read?\"\n\n\"Twenty-six.\"\n\n\"Good. I've found only one, but we're running out of time. I'm coming\nin.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the lifecraft he closed the port and slammed on full drive away from\nthe ship. Then, wheeling, he shucked Barbara out of her suit like an ear\nof corn and shed his own. He picked up a fire-extinguisher-like affair\nand jerked open the door of a room a little larger than a clothes\ncloset. \"Jump in here!\" He slammed the door shut. \"Now strip, quick!\" He\npicked the canister up and twisted four valves.\n\nBefore he could get the gun into working position she was out of her\npajamas--the fact that she had been wondering visibly what it was all\nabout had done nothing whatever to cut down her speed. A flood of thick,\ncreamy foam almost hid her from sight and Deston began to talk--quietly.\n\n\"Thanks, sweetheart, for not slowing us down by arguing and wanting\nexplanations. This stuff is DEKON--short for Decontaminant, Complete;\nCompound, Adsorbent, and Chelating, Type DCQ-429.' Used soon enough, it\ntakes care of radiation. Rub it in good, all over you--like this.\" He\nset the foam-gun down on the floor and went vigorously to work. \"Yes,\nhair, too. Every square millimeter of skin and mucous membrane. Yes,\ninto your eyes. It stings 'em a little, but that's a lot better than\ngoing blind. And your mouth. Swallow six good big mouthfuls--it's\ntasteless and goes down easy.\n\n\"Now the soles of your feet--O. K. The last will hurt plenty, but we've\n_got_ to get some of it into your lungs and we can't do it the hospital\nway. So when I slap a gob of it over your mouth and nose inhale hard and\ndeep. Just once is all anybody can do, but that's enough. And don't\nfight. Any ordinary woman I could handle, but I can't handle you fast\nenough. So if you don't inhale deep I'll have to knock you cold.\nOtherwise you die of lung cancer. Will do?\"\n\n\"Will do, sweetheart. Good and deep. No fight,\" and she emptied her\nlungs.\n\nHe slapped it on. She inhaled, good and deep; and went into convulsive\nparoxysms of coughing. He held her in his arms until the worst of it was\nover; but she was still coughing hard when she pulled herself away from\nhim.\n\n\"But ... how ... about ... you?\" She could just barely talk; her voice\nwas distorted, almost inaudible. \"Let ... me ... help ... you ...\nquick!\"\n\n\"No need, darling. Two other men out there. The old man probably won't\nneed it--I think I got him into the safe quick enough--the other guy and\nI will help each other. So lie down there on the bunk and take it easy\nuntil I come back here and help you get the gunkum off. So-long for half\nan hour, pet.\"\n\nForty-five minutes later, while all four were still cleaning up the\nmesses of foam, something began to buzz sharply. Deston stepped over to\nthe board and flipped a switch. The communicator came on. Since\neverything aboard a starship is designed to fail safe, they were, of\ncourse, in normal space. On the visiplates hundreds of stars blazed in\nvari-colored points of hard, bright light.\n\n\"Baby Two acknowledging,\" Deston said. \"First Officer Deston and three\npassengers. Deconned to zero. Report, please.\"\n\n\"Baby Three. Second Officer Jones and four passengers. Deconned to----\"\n\n\"Thank God, Herc!\" Formality vanished. \"With _you_ to astrogate us, we\nmay have a chance. But how'd you make it? I'd've sworn a flying saucer\ncouldn't've got down from the Top in the time we had.\"\n\n\"Same thing right back at you, Babe. I didn't have to come down. We were\nin Baby Three when it happened.\" Full vision was on; a big,\nsquare-jawed, lean, tanned face looked out at them from the screen.\n\n\"Huh? How come? And who's 'we'?\"\n\n\"My wife and I.\" Second Officer Theodore \"Hercules\" Jones was somewhat\nembarrassed. \"I got married, too, day before yesterday. After the way\nthe old man chewed you out, though, I knew he'd slap irons on me\nwithout saying a word, so we kept it dark and hid out in Baby Three.\nThese three are all we could find before our meters went high red. I\ndeconned Bun, then----\"\n\n\"Bun?\" Barbara broke in. \"Bernice Burns? How _wonderful_!\"\n\n\"Formerly Bernice Burns.\" The face of a platinum-blonde beauty appeared\non the screen beside Jones'. \"And _am_ I glad to see _you_, Barbara,\neven if I did just meet you yesterday! I didn't know whether I'd ever\nsee another girl's face or not!\"\n\n\"Let's cut the chat,\" Deston said then. \"Herc, give me course, blast,\nand time for rendezvous ... hey! My watch stopped!\"\n\n\"So did mine,\" Jones said. \"So just hold one gravity on eighteen dash\nforty-seven dash two seventy-one and I'll correct you as necessary.\"\n\nAfter setting course, and still thinking of his watch, Deston said; \"But\nit's nonmagnetic. It never stopped before.\"\n\nThe gray-haired man spoke. \"It was never in such a field before. You\nsee, those two observations of fact invalidate twenty-four of the\nthirty-eight best theories of hyper-space. But tell me--am I correct in\nsaying that none of you were in direct contact with the metal of the\nship when it happened?\"\n\n\"We avoid it in case of trouble. You? Name and job?\" Deston jerked his\nhead at the younger stranger.\n\n\"I know _that_ much. Henry Newman. Crew-chief, normal space jobs,\nunlimited.\"\n\n\"Your passengers, Herc?\"\n\n\"Vincent Lopresto, financier, and his two bodyguards. They were sleeping\nin their suits, on air-mattresses. Grounders. Don't like subspace--or\nspace, either.\"\n\n\"Just so.\" The gray-haired man nodded, almost happily. \"We survivors,\nthen, absorbed the charge gradually----\"\n\n\"But what the----\" Deston began.\n\n\"One moment, please, young man. You perhaps saw some of the bodies. What\nwere they like?\"\n\n\"They looked ... well, not exactly as though they had exploded, but----\"\nhe paused.\n\n\"Precisely.\" Gray-Hair beamed. \"That eliminates all the others except\nthree--Morton's, Sebring's, and Rothstein's.\"\n\n\"You're a specialist in subspace, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I'm not a specialist at all. I'm a dabbler, really. A\nspecialist, you know, is one who learns more and more about less and\nless until he knows everything about nothing at all. I'm just the\nopposite. I'm learning less and less about more and more; hoping in time\nto know nothing at all about everything.\"\n\n\"In other words, a Fellow of the College. I'm glad you're aboard, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh, a Theoretician?\" Barbara's face lit up and she held out her hand.\n\"With dozens of doctorates in everything from Astronomy to Zoology?\nI've never met ... I'm _ever_ so glad to meet you, Doctor----?\"\n\n\"Adams. Andrew Adams. But I have only eight at the moment. Earned\ndegrees, that is.\"\n\n\"But what were you doing in this lifecraft? No, let me guess. You were\nX-ray-eying it and fine-toothing it for improvements made since your\nlast trip, and storing the details away in your eidetic memory.\"\n\n\"Not eidetic, by any means. Merely very good.\"\n\n\"And how many metric tons of apparatus have you got in the hold?\" Deston\nasked.\n\n\"Less than six. Just what I _must_ have in order to----\"\n\n\"Babe!\" Jones' voice cut in. \"Course change. Stay on alpha eighteen.\nShift beta to forty-four and gamma to two sixty-five.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRendezvous was made. Both lifecraft hung motionless relative to the\n_Procyon_'s hulk. No other lifecraft had escaped. A conference was held.\n\nWeeks of work would be necessary before Deston and Jones could learn\neven approximately what the damage to the _Procyon_ had been.\nDecontamination was automatic, of course, but there would be literally\nhundreds of hot spots, each of which would have to be sought out and\nneutralized by hand. The passengers' effects would have to be listed and\nstored in the proper cabins. Each body would have to be given velocity\naway from the ship. And so on. Every survivor would have to work, and\nwork hard.\n\nThe two girls wanted to be together. The two officers almost _had_ to be\ntogether, to discuss matters at unhampered length and to make decisions.\nEach was, of course, almost as well versed in engineering as he was in\nhis own specialty. All ships' officers from First to Fifth had to be.\nAnd, as long as they lived or until the _Procyon_ made port, all\nresponsibility rested: First, upon First Officer Deston; and second,\nupon Second Officer Jones. Therefore Theodore and Bernice Jones came\naboard Lifecraft Two, and Deston asked Newman to flit across to\nLifecraft Three.\n\n\"Not me; I like the scenery here better.\" Newman's eyes raked Bernice's\nfive-feet-eight of scantily-clad sheer beauty from ankles to coiffure.\n\"If you're too crowded--I know a lifecraft carries only fifty people--go\nyourself.\"\n\n\"As a crew-chief, you know the law.\" Deston spoke quietly--too quietly,\nas the other man should have known. \"I am in command.\"\n\n\"You ain't in command of _me_, pretty boy!\" Newman sneered. \"You can\nplay God when you're on sked, with a ship-full of trained dogs to bite\nfor you, but out here where nobody has ever come back from I make my own\nlaw--with _this_!\" He patted his side pocket.\n\n\"Draw it, then!\" Deston's voice now had all the top-deck rasp of his\nrank. \"Or crawl!\"\n\nThe First Officer had not moved; his right hand still hung quietly at\nhis side. Newman glanced at the girls, both of whom were frozen; at\nJones, who smiled at him pityingly; at Adams, who was merely interested.\n\"I ... my ... yours is right where you can get at it,\" he faltered.\n\n\"You should have thought of that sooner. But, this once, I won't move a\nfinger until your hand is in your pocket.\"\n\n\"Just wing him, Babe,\" Jones said then. \"He looks strong enough, except\nfor his head. We can use him to shovel out the gunkum and clean up.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh. I'll have to kill him sometime, and the sooner the better.\nSquare between the eyes. Do you want a hundred limit at ten bucks a\nmillimeter on how far the hole is off dead center?\"\n\nThe two girls gasped; stared at each other and at the two officers in\nhorror; but Jones said calmly, without losing any part of his smile: \"I\ndon't want a dime's worth of that. I've lost too much money that way\nalready.\" At which outrageous statement both girls knew what was going\non and smiled in relief.\n\nAnd Newman misinterpreted those smiles completely; especially Bernice's.\nThe words came hard, but he managed to say then. \"I crawl.\"\n\n\"Crawl, what?\"\n\n\"I crawl, sir. You'll want my gun----\"\n\n\"Keep it. There's a lot more difference than _that_ between us. How\nclose can you count seconds?\"\n\n\"Plus or minus five per cent, sir.\"\n\n\"Close enough. Your first job will be to build some kind of a\nbrute-force, belt-or-gear thing to act as a clock. You will really work.\nAny more insubordination or any malingering at all and I'll put you into\na lifecraft and launch you into space, where you can make your own laws\nand be monarch of all you survey. Dismissed! Now--flit!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNewman flitted--fast--and Barbara, turning to her husband, opened her\nmouth to speak and shut it. No, he would have killed the man; he would\nhave _had_ to. He still might have to. Wherefore she said instead:\n\"Why'd you let him keep his pistol? The ... the _slime_! And after you\nactually saved his life, too!\"\n\n\"With some people what's past doesn't count. The other was just a\ngesture. Psychology. It'll slow him down, I think. Besides, he'd have\nanother one as soon as we get back into the _Procyon_.\"\n\n\"But you can lock up _all_ their guns, can't you?\" Bernice asked.\n\n\"I'm afraid not. How about the other three, Herc?\"\n\n\"With thanks to you, Barbara, for the word; slime. If Lopresto is a\nfinancier, I'm an angel, with wings and halo complete. Gangsters;\nhoodlums; racketeers; you'd have to open every can of concentrate aboard\nto find all their spare artillery.\"\n\n\"Check. The first thing to do is----\"\n\n\"One word first,\" Bernice put in. \"I want to thank you, First Off--no,\nnot First Officer, but I could hardly----\"\n\n\"Sure you can. I'm 'Babe' to us all, and you're 'Bun'. As to the other,\nforget it. You and I, Herc, will go over and----\"\n\n\"And I,\" Adams put in, definitely. \"I must photograph everything, before\nit is touched; therefore I must be the first on board. I must do some\nautopsies and also----\"\n\n\"Of course. You're right,\" Deston said. \"And if I haven't said it\nbefore, I'm tremendously glad to have a Big Brain along ... oh, excuse\nthat crack, please, Dr. Adams. It slipped out on me.\"\n\nAdams laughed. \"In context, I regard that as the highest compliment I\nhave ever received. To you youngsters my advanced age of fifty-two\nrepresents senility. Nevertheless, you men need not 'Doctor' me. Either\n'Adams' or 'Andy' will do very nicely. As for you two young women----\"\n\n\"I'm going to call you 'Uncle Andy',\" Barbara said, with a grin. \"Now,\nUncle Andy, you being a Big Brain--the term being used in its most\ncomplimentary sense--and the way you talked, one of your eight\ndoctorates is in medicine.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Are you any good at obstetrics?\"\n\n\"In the present instance I am perfectly safe in saying----\"\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" Deston snapped. \"Bobby, you are _not_----\"\n\n\"I am too! That is, I don't suppose I _am_ yet, since we were married\nonly last Tuesday, but if he's competent--and I'm _sure_ he is--I'm\ncertainly _going_ to! If we get back to Earth I _want_ to, and if we\ndon't, both Bun and I have _got_ to. Castaways' Code, you know. So how\nabout it, Uncle Andy?\"\n\n\"I know what you two girls are,\" Adams said, quietly. \"I know what you\ntwo men must of necessity be. Therefore I can say without reservation\nthat none of you need feel any apprehension whatever.\"\n\nDeston was about to say something, but Barbara forestalled him. \"Well,\nwe can _think_ about it, anyway, and talk it over. But for right now, I\nthink it's high time we all got some sleep. Don't you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was; and they did; and after they had slept and had eaten \"breakfast\"\nthe three men wafted themselves across a couple of hundred yards of\nspace to the crippled starship. Powerful floodlights were rigged.\n\n\"What ... a ... mess.\" Deston's voice was low and wondering. \"The whole\nTop looks as though she'd crash-landed and spun out for eight miles. But\nthe Middle and Tail look untouched.\"\n\nInside, however, devastation had gone deep into the Middle. Bulkheads,\nwalls, floors, structural members; were torn, sheared, twisted into\nweirdly-distorted shapes impossible to understand or explain. And, much\nworse, were the _absences_; for in dozens of volumes, of as many sizes\nand of shapes incompatible with any three-dimensional geometry, every\nsolid thing had vanished--without leaving any clue whatever as to where\nor how it had gone.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAfter three long days of hard work, Adams was satisfied. He had taken\npictures as fast as both officers could process the film; he had covered\nmany miles of tape with words only half of which either spaceman could\nunderstand. Then, finally, he said:\n\n\"Well, that covers the preliminary observations as well as I know how to\ndo it. Thank you, boys, for your forbearance and your help. Now, if\nyou'll help me find my stuff and bring some of it--a computer and so\non--up to the lounge?\" They did so; the \"and so on\" proving to be a\nbewildering miscellany indeed. \"Thank you immensely, gentlemen; now I\nwon't bother you any more.\"\n\n\"You've learned a lot, Doc, and we haven't learned much of anything.\"\nDeston grinned ruefully. \"That makes you the director. You'll have to\ntell us, in general terms, what to do.\"\n\n\"Oh? I can offer a few suggestions. It is virtually certain: One, that\nno subspace equipment will function. Two, that all normal-space\nequipment, except for some items you know about, will function normally.\nThree, that we can't do anything about subspace without landing on a\nplanet. Four, that such landing will require extreme--I might almost say\nfantastic--precautions.\"\n\nAlthough both officers thought that they understood Item Four, neither\nof them had any inkling as to what Adams really meant. They did\nunderstand thoroughly, however, Items One, Two, and Three.\n\n\"Hell's jets!\" Deston exclaimed. \"Do you mean we'll have to blast\n_normal_ to a system?\"\n\n\"It isn't as bad as you think, Babe,\" Jones said. \"Stars are much\nthicker here--we're in the center somewhere--than around Sol. The\nprobability is point nine plus that any emergence would put us less than\npoint four light-years away from a star. A couple of them show disks. I\nhaven't measured any yet; have you, Doc?\"\n\n\"Yes. Point two two, approximately, to the closest.\"\n\n\"So what?\" Deston demanded. \"What's the chance of it having an\nEarth-type planet?\"\n\n\"Any solid planet will do,\" Adams said. \"Just so it has plenty of mass.\"\n\n\"That's still quite a trip.\" Deston was coming around. \"Especially since\nwe can't use more than one point----\"\n\n\"One point _zero_ gravities,\" Jones put in.\n\n\"Over the long pull--and the women--you're right,\" Deston agreed, and\ntook out his slide rule. \"Let's see ... one gravity, plus and minus ...\nvelocity ... time ... it'll take about eleven months?\"\n\n\"Just about,\" Jones agreed, and Adams nodded.\n\n\"Well, if that's what the cards say, there's no use yowling about it,\"\nand all nine survivors went to work.\n\nDeston, besides working, directed the activities of all the others\nexcept Adams; who worked harder and longer than did anyone else. He\nbarely took time out to eat and to sleep. Nor did either Deston or Jones\nask him what he was doing. Both knew that it would take five years of\nadvanced study before either of them could understand the simplest\nmaterial on the doctor's tapes.\n\n\nIII.\n\nThe tremendous engines of the _Procyon_ were again putting out their\nwonted torrents of power. The starship, now a mere spaceship, was on\ncourse at one gravity. The lifecraft were in their slots, but the five\nand the four still lived in them rather than in the vast and oppressive\nemptiness that the ship itself now was. And socially, outside of working\nhours, the two groups did not mix.\n\nClean-up was going nicely, at the union rate of six hours on and\neighteen hours off. Deston could have set any hours he pleased, but he\ndidn't. There was plenty of time. Eleven months in deep space is a\nfearfully, a tremendously long time.\n\n\"Morning,\" \"afternoon,\" \"evening,\" and \"night\" were, of course, purely\nconventional terms. The twenty-four-hour \"day\" measured off by the\nbrute-force machine that was their masterclock carried no guarantee,\nexpressed or implied, as to either accuracy or uniformity.\n\nOne evening, then, four hard-faced men sat at two small tables in the\nmain room of Lifecraft Three. Two of them, Ferdy Blaine and Moose\nMordan, were playing cards for small stakes. Ferdy was of medium size;\ncompact rather than slender; built of rawhide and spring steel. Lithe\nand poised, he was the epitome of leashed and controlled action. Moose\nwas six-feet-four and weighed a good two-forty--stolid, massive, solid.\nFerdy and Moose; a tiger and an elephant; both owned _in fee simple_ by\nVincent Lopresto.\n\nThe two at the other table had been planning for days. They had had many\nvitriolic arguments, but neither had made any motion toward his weapon.\n\n\"Play it my way and we've got it made, I tell you!\" Newman pounded the\ntable with his fist. \"Seventy _million_ if it's a cent! Heavier grease\nthan your lousy spig Syndicate ever even _heard_ of! I'm as good an\nastrogator as Jones is, and a damn sight better engineer. In electronics\nI maybe ain't got the theory Pretty Boy has, but at building and\nrepairing the stuff I've forgot more than he ever will know. At\n_practical_ stuff, and that's all we give a whoop about, I lay over\nboth them sissies like a Lunar dome.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah?\" Lopresto sneered. \"How come you aren't ticketed for\nsubspace, then?\"\n\n\"For hell's sake, act your age!\" Newman snorted in disgust. Eyes locked\nand held, but nothing happened. \"D'ya think I'm dumb? Or that them\nsubspace Boy Scouts can be fixed? Or I don't know where the heavy grease\nis at? Or I can't make the approach? Why ain't _you_ in subspace?\"\n\n\"I see.\" Lopresto forced his anger down. \"But I've got to be _sure_ we\ncan get back without 'em.\"\n\n\"You can be _damn_ sure. I got to get back myself, don't I? But get one\nthing down solid. _I_ get the big peroxide blonde.\"\n\n\"You can have her. Too big. I like the little yellowhead a lot better.\"\n\nNewman sneered into the hard-held face so close to his and said: \"And\ndon't think for a second _you_ can make me crawl, you small-time,\nchiseling punk. Rub _me_ out after we kill them off and you get nowhere.\nYou're dead. Chew on that a while, and you'll know who's boss.\"\n\nAfter just the right amount of holding back and objecting, Lopresto\nagreed. \"You win, Newman, the way the cards lay. Have you ever planned\nthis kind of an operation or do you want me to?\"\n\n\"You do it, Vince,\" Newman said, grandly. He had at least one of the\nqualities of a leader. \"Besides, you already have, ain't you?\"\n\n\"Of course. Ferdy will take Deston----\"\n\n\"No he won't! He's _mine_, the louse!\"\n\n\"If you're _that_ dumb, all bets are off. What are you using for a\nbrain? Can't you see the guy's chain lightning on ball bearings?\"\n\n\"But we're going to surprise 'em, ain't we?\"\n\n\"Sure, but even Ferdy would just as soon not give _him_ an even break.\n_You_ wouldn't stand the chance of a snowflake in hell, and if you've\ngot the brains of a louse you know it.\"\n\n\"O. K., we'll let Ferdy have him. Me and you will match draws to see\nwho----\"\n\n\"I can draw twice to your once, but I suppose I'll have to prove it to\nyou. I'll take Jones; you will gun the professor; Moose will grab the\ndames, one under each arm, and keep 'em out of the way until the\nshooting's over. The only thing is, when? The sooner the better.\nTomorrow?\"\n\n\"Not quite, Vince. Let 'em finish figuring course, time, distance, all\nthat stuff. They can do it a lot faster and some better than I can. I'll\ntell you when.\"\n\n\"O. K., and I'll give the signal. When I yell 'NOW' we give 'em the\nbusiness.\"\n\nNewman went to his cabin and the muscle called Moose spoke thoughtfully.\nThat is, as nearly thoughtfully as his mental equipment would allow.\n\n\"I don't like that ape, boss. Before you gun him, let me work him over\njust a little bit, huh?\"\n\n\"It'll be quite a while yet, but that's a promise, Moose. As soon as his\njob's done he'll wish he'd never been born. Until then, we'll let him\nthink he's Top Dog. Let him rave. But Ferdy, any time he's behind me or\nout of sight, watch him like a hawk. Shoot him through the right elbow\nif he makes one sour move.\"\n\n\"I get you, boss.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA couple of evenings later, in Lifecraft Two, Barbara said: \"You're\nworried, Babe, and everything's going so smoothly. Why?\"\n\n\"Too smoothly altogether. That's why. Newman ought to be doing a slow\nburn and goldbricking all he dares; instead of which he's happy as a\nclam and working like a nailer ... and I wouldn't trust Vincent Lopresto\nor Ferdinand Blaine as far as I can throw a brick chimney by its smoke.\nThis whole situation stinks. There's going to be shooting for sure.\"\n\n\"But they couldn't do _anything_ without you two!\" Bernice exclaimed.\n\"It'd be suicide ... and with no motive ... _could_ they, Ted,\npossibly?\"\n\nJones' dark face did not lighten. \"They could, and I'm very much afraid\nthey intend to. As a crew-chief, Newman is a jack-leg engineer and a\nvery good practical 'troncist; and if he's what I _think_ he is----\" He\npaused.\n\n\"Could be,\" Deston said, doubtfully. \"In with a mob of normal-space\npirate-smugglers. I'll buy that, but there wouldn't be enough plunder\nto----\"\n\n\"Just a sec. So he's a pretty good rule-of-thumb astrogator, too, and\nwe're computing every element of the flight. As for motive--salvage.\nWith either of us alive, none. With both of us dead, can you guess\nwithin ten million bucks of how much they'll collect?\"\n\n\"_Blockhead_!\" Deston slapped himself on the forehead. \"I never even\n_thought_ of that angle. That nails it down solid.\"\n\n\"With the added attraction,\" Jones went on, coldly and steadily, \"of\nhaving two extremely desirable female women for eleven months before\nkilling them, too.\"\n\nBoth girls shrank visibly, and Deston said: \"Check. I thought that was\nthe main feature, but it didn't add up. This does. Now, how will they\nfigure the battle? Both of us at once, of----\"\n\n\"Why?\" Barbara asked. \"I'd think they'd waylay you, one at a time.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh. The survivor would lock the ship in null-G and it'd be like\nshooting fish in a barrel. Since we're almost never together on duty ...\nand it won't come until after we've finished the computations ...\nthey'll think up a good reason for _everybody_ to be together, and that\nitself will be the tip-off. Ferdy will probably draw on me----\"\n\n\"And he'll kill you,\" Jones said, flatly. \"So I think I'll blow his\nbrains out tomorrow morning on sight.\"\n\n\"And get killed yourself? No ... much better to use their own trap----\"\n\n\"We _can't_! Fast as you are, you aren't in _his_ class. He's a\nprofessional--probably one of the fastest guns in space.\"\n\n\"Yes, but ... I've got a ... I mean I think I can----\"\n\nBernice, grinning openly now, stopped Deston's floundering. \"It's high\ntime you fellows told each other the truth. Bobby and I let our back\nhair down long ago--we were both tremendously surprised to know that\nboth you boys are just as strongly psychic as we are. Perhaps even more\nso.\"\n\n\"Oh ... so _you_ get hunches, too?\" Jones demanded. \"So you'll have\nplenty of warning?\"\n\n\"All my life. The old alarm clock has never failed me yet. But the girls\ncan't start packing pistols now.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know how to shoot one if I did,\" Bernice laughed. \"I'll\nthrow things I'm very good at that.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Jones asked. He didn't know his new wife very well, either. \"What\ncan _you_ throw straight enough to do any good?\"\n\n\"Anything I can reach,\" she replied, confidently. \"Baseballs, medicine\nballs, cannon balls, rocks, bricks, darts, discus, hammer,\njavelin--what-have-you. In a for-real battle I'd prefer ... chairs, I\nthink. Flying chairs are really hard to cope with. Knives are too ...\nuh-uh, I'd much rather have you fellows do the actual executing. I'll\nstart wearing a couple of knives in leg-sheaths, but I won't throw 'em\nor use 'em unless I absolutely have to. So who will I knock out with the\nfirst chair?\"\n\n\"I'll answer that,\" Barbara said, quietly. \"If it's Blaine against Babe,\nit'll be Lopresto against Herc. So you'll throw your chairs or whatever\nat that unspeakable oaf Newman.\"\n\n\"I'd rather brain him than anyone else I know, but that would leave that\ngigantic gorilla to ... why, he'd ... listen, you'll simply _have_ to go\narmed.\"\n\n\"I always do.\" Barbara held out her hands. \"Since they don't want to\nshoot us two--yet--these are all the weapons I'll need.\"\n\n\"Against a man-mountain like that? You're _that_ good? Really?\"\n\n\"Especially against a man-mountain like that. I'm that good. Really,\"\nand both Joneses began to realize what Deston already knew--just how\ndeadly those harmless-seeming weapons could be.\n\nBarbara went on: \"We should have a signal, in case one of us gets\nwarning first. Something that wouldn't mean anything to them ...\nmusical, say ... Brahms. That's it. The very instant any one of us feels\ntheir intent to signal their attack he yells 'BRAHMS!' and we _all_ beat\nthem to the punch. O. K.?\"\n\nIt was O. K., and the four--Adams was still hard at work in the\nlounge--went to bed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd three days later, within an hour after the last flight-datum had\nbeen \"put in the tank,\" the four intended victims allowed themselves to\nbe inveigled into the lounge. Everything was peaceful; everyone was full\nof friendship and brotherly love. But suddenly \"BRAHMS!\" rang out, with\nfour voices in absolute unison; followed a moment later by Lopresto's\nstentorian \"NOW!\"\n\nIt was a very good thing that Deston had had ample warning, for he was\nindeed competing out of his class. As it was, his bullet crashed through\nBlaine's head, while the gunman's went harmlessly into the carpet. The\nother pistol duel wasn't even close! Lopresto's hand barely touched his\ngun.\n\nBernice, even while shrieking the battle-cry, leaped to her feet, hurled\nher chair, and reached for another; but one chair was enough. That\nfiercely but accurately-sped missile knocked the half-drawn pistol from\nNewman's hand and sent his body crashing to the floor, where Deston's\nsecond bullet made it certain that he would not recover consciousness.\n\nBarbara's hand-to-hand engagement took about one second longer. Moose\nMordan was big and strong; and, for such a big man, was fairly fast\nphysically. If he had had time to get his muscles ready, he might have\nhad a chance. His thought processes, however, were lamentably slow; and\nBarbara Warner Deston was almost as fast physically as she was mentally.\nThus she reached him before he even began to realize that this\npint-sized girl actually intended to hit him; and thus it was that his\nbelly-muscles were still completely relaxed when her small but extremely\nhard left fist sank half-forearm-deep into his solar plexus.\n\nWith an agonized \"_WHOOSH_!\" he began to double up, but she scarcely\nallowed him to bend. Her right hand, fingers tightly bunched, was\nalready boring savagely into a selected spot at the base of his neck.\nThen, left hand at his throat and right hand pulling hard at his belt,\nshe put the totalized and concentrated power of her whole body behind\nthe knee she drove into his groin.\n\nThat ended it. The big man could very well have been dying on his feet.\nTo make sure, however--or to keep the girl from knowing that she had\nkilled a man?--Deston and Jones each put a bullet through the falling\nhead before it struck the rug.\n\nBoth girls flung themselves, sobbing, into their husband's arms.\n\nThe whole battle had lasted only a few seconds. Adams, although he had\nseen almost everything, had been concentrating so deeply that it took\nthose few seconds for him actually to realize what was going on. He got\nup, felt[2] of Newman's head, then looked casually at the three other\nbodies.\n\n    [2] Transcriber's note: As in original.\n\n\"Oh, I _killed_ him, Carl!\" Barbara sobbed, convulsively. \"And the worst\nof it is, I really _meant_ to! I _never_ did anything like that before\nin my whole life!\"\n\n\"You didn't kill him, Barbara,\" Adams said.\n\n\"Huh?\" She raised her head from Deston's shoulder; the contrast between\nher streaming eyes and the relief dawning over her whole face was almost\nfunny. \"Why, I did the foulest things possible, and as hard as I\npossibly could. I'm _sure_ I killed him.\"\n\n\"By no means, my dear. Judo techniques, however skillfully and\npowerfully applied, do not and can not kill instantly. Bullets through\nthe brain do. I will photograph the cadavers, of course, and perform the\ncustomary post-mortem examinations for the record; but I know already\nwhat the findings will be. These four men died instantly of gunshot\nwounds.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the four gangsters gone, life aboardship settled down quickly into\na routine. That routine, however, was in no sense dull. The officers had\nplenty to do; operating the whole ship and rebuilding the mechanisms\nthat were operating on jury rigging or on straight \"bread-board\"\nhookups. And in their \"spare\" time they enjoyed themselves tremendously\nin becoming better and better acquainted with their wives. For Bernice\nand Jones, like Barbara and Deston, had for each other an infinite\nnumber of endless vistas of personality; the exploration of which was\nsheerest delight.\n\nThe girls--each of whom became joyously pregnant as soon as she\ncould--kept house and helped their husbands whenever need or opportunity\narose. Their biggest chore, however, was to see to it that Adams got\nsleep, food, and exercise. For, if left to his own devices, he would\nnever have exercised at all, would have grabbed a bite now and then, and\nwould have slept only when he could no longer stay awake.\n\n\"Uncle Andy, why don't you _use_ that Big Brain of yours?\" Barbara\nsnapped at him one day. \"For a man that's actually as smart as you are,\nI swear you've got the least sense of anybody I know!\"\n\n\"But it's necessary, my dear child,\" Adams explained, unmoved. \"This\nmaterial is new. There are many extremely difficult problems involved,\nand I have less than a year to work on them. Less than _one year_; and\nit is a task for a team of specialists and all the resources of a\nresearch center.\"\n\nTo the officers, however, Adams went into more detail. \"Considering the\nenormous amounts of supplies carried; the scope, quantity, and quality\nof the safety devices employed; it is improbable that we are the first\nsurvivors of a subspace catastrophe to set course for a planet.\"\n\nAfter some argument, the officers agreed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"While I cannot as yet detect it, classify it, or evaluate it, we are\ncarrying an extremely heavy charge of an unknown nature; the residuum of\na field of force which is possibly more or less analogous to the\nelectromagnetic field. This residuum either is or is not dischargeable\nto an object of planetary mass; and I'm virtually certain that it is.\nThe discharge may be anything from an imperceptible flow up to one of\nsuch violence as to volatilize the craft carrying it. From the facts:\nOne, that in the absence of that field the subspace radio will function\nnormally; and Two, that no subspace-radio messages have ever been\nreceived from survivors; the conclusion seems inescapable that the\ndischarge of this unknown field is in fact of extreme violence.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" Deston exclaimed. \"Oh ... _that_ was what you meant by\n'fantastic precautions,' back there?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"But what can we _do_ about it?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I ... simply ... do ... not ... know.\" Adams lost himself\nin thought for over a minute. \"This is all _so_ new ... I know _so_\nlittle ... and am working with such _pitifully_ inadequate\ninstrumentation--However, we have months of time yet, and if I am unable\nto arrive at a conclusion before arrival--I don't mean a rigorous\nanalysis, of course, but merely a stop-gap, empirical, pragmatic\nsolution--we will simply remain in orbit around that sun until I do.\"\n\n\nIV.\n\nThe _Procyon_ bored on through space, at one unchanging gravity of\nacceleration. It may not seem, at first glance, that one gravity would\nresult in any very high velocity; but when it is maintained steadily for\ndays and weeks and months, it builds up to a very respectable speed. Nor\nwas there any question of power, for the _Procyon_'s atomics did not\ndrive the ship, but merely energized the \"Chaytors\"--the Chaytor Effect\nengines that tapped the energy of the expanding universe itself.\n\nThus, in less than six months, the _Procyon_ had attained a velocity\nalmost half that of light. At the estimated mid-point of the flight the\nspaceship, still at one gravity of drive, was turned end-for-end; so\nthat for the ensuing five-and-a-fraction months she would be slowing\ndown.\n\nA few weeks after the turnover, Adams seemed to have more time. At\nleast, he devoted more time to the expectant mothers, even to the point\nof supervising Deston and Jones in the construction of a weirdly-wired\ndevice by means of which he studied and photographed the unborn child\neach woman bore. He said nothing, however, until Barbara made him talk.\n\n\"Listen, you egregious clam,\" she said, firmly, \"I know darn well I've\nbeen pregnant for at _least_ seven months, and I ought to be twice this\nbig. Our clock isn't _that_ far off; Carl said that by wave lengths or\nsomething it's only about three per cent fast. And you've been\npussyfooting and hem-hawing around all this time. Now, Uncle Andy, I\nwant the _truth_. _Are_ we in for a lot of trouble?\"\n\n\"Trouble? Of course not. _Certainly_ not. No trouble at all, my dear.\nWhy, you've seen the pictures--here, look at them again ... see?\nAbsolutely normal fetus--yours, too, Bernice. _Perfect_! No\nmalformations of any kind.\"\n\n\"Yes, but for what _age_?\" Bernice asked, pointedly. \"Four months, say?\nI see, I was exposed to a course in embryology myself, once.\"\n\n\"But _that's_ the interesting part of it!\" Adams enthused. \"Fascinating!\nAnd, indubitably, supremely important. In fact, it may point out the key\ndatum underlying the solution of our entire problem. If this zeta field\nis causing this seemingly peculiar biological effect, that gives us a\ntremendously powerful new tool, for certain time vectors in the\ngeneralized matrix become parameters. Thus, certain determinants,\nnotably the all-important delta-prime-sub-mu, become manipulable by ...\nbut you aren't _listening_!\"\n\n\"I'm listening, pops, but nothing is coming through. But thanks much,\nanyway. I feel a lot better, knowing I'm not going to give birth to a\nmonster. Or _are_ you sure, really?\"\n\n\"Of _course_ I'm sure!\" Adams snapped, testily, and Barbara led Deston\naside.\n\n\"Have you got the _slightest_ idea of what he was talking about?\" she\nasked.\n\n\"Just the slightest, if any. Either that time is relative--no, that's so\nelementary he wouldn't mention it. Maybe he's figured out a _variable_\ntime of some kind or other. Anyway, you girls' slowness in producing has\ngiven the old boy a big lift, and I'm mighty glad of it.\"\n\n\"But aren't you _worried_, sweetheart? Not even the least little bit?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" and Deston very evidently meant just that.\n\n\"I am. I can't help but be. Why aren't you?\"\n\n\"Because Doc isn't, and he knows his stuff, believe me. He can't lie any\nbetter than a three-year-old, and he's _sure_ that all four of you are\njust as safe as though you were in God's lefthand hip pocket.\"\n\n\"Oh--that's right. I never thought of it that way. So I _don't_ have\nanything to worry about, do I?\" She lifted her lips to be kissed; and\nthe kiss was long and sweet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTime flew past until, one day a couple of weeks short of arrival, Adams\nrushed up to Deston and Jones. \"I have it!\" he shouted, and began to\nspout a torrent of higher--very _much_ higher--mathematics.\n\n\"Hold it, Doc!\" Deston held up an expostulatory hand. \"I read you zero\nand ten. Can't you delouse your signal? Whittle the stuff down to our\nsize?\"\n\n\"W-e-l-l-,\" the scientist looked hurt, but did consent to forego the\nhigh math. \"The discharge _is_ catastrophic; in energy equivalent\nsomething of the order of magnitude of ten thousand discharges of\nlightning. And, unfortunately, I do _not_ know what it is. It is\nvirtually certain, however, that we will be able to dissipate it in\nsuccessive decrements by the use of long, thin leads extending downward\ntoward a high point of the planet.\"\n\n\"Wire, you mean? What kind?\"\n\n\"The material is not important except in that it should have sufficient\ntensile strength to support as many miles as possible of its own\nlength.\"\n\n\"We've got dozens of coils of hook-up wire,\" Deston said, \"but not too\nmany _miles_ and it's soft stuff.\"\n\n\"_Graham_ wire!\" Jones snapped his finger.\n\n\"Of course,\" Deston agreed. \"Hundreds of miles of it. Float the senser\ndown on a Hotchkiss----\"\n\n\"Tear-out.\" Jones objected.\n\n\"Bailey it--spidered out to twenty or so big, flat feet. That'll take\nmetal, but we can cannibal the whole Middle without weakening the\nstructure.\"\n\n\"Sure ... surges--backlash. Remote it.\"\n\n\"Check. Remote everything to Baby Two, and----\"\n\n\"Would you mind delousing _your_ signal?\" Adams asked, caustically.\n\n\"'Scuse, please, Doc. A guy does talk better in his own lingo, doesn't\nhe? Well, Graham wire is one-point-three-millimeter-diameter,\nultra-high-tensile steel wire. Used for re-wrapping the Grahams, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"No, I don't know. What are Grahams?\"\n\n\"Why, they're the intermediates between the Chaytors ... O. K., O. K.,\nthey're something like bottles, that have to stand terrifically high\npressures.\"\n\n\"That's what I want to know. Such wire will do very nicely. Note now\nthat our bodies must be grounded very thoroughly to the metal of the\nship.\"\n\n\"You're so right. We'll wrap the girls in silver-mesh underwear up to\nthe eyeballs, and run leads as big as my wrist to the frame.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe approach was made, and the fourth planet out from that strange sun\nwas selected as a ground. That planet was not at all like Earth. It had\nvery little water, very little atmosphere, and very little vegetation.\nIt was twice as massive as Earth; its surface was rugged and jagged; one\nof its stupendous mountain ranges had sharp peaks more than forty\nthousand feet high.\n\n\"There's one thing more we must do,\" Adams said. \"I have barely\nbegun to study this zeta field, and this one may very well be\nunique--irreplaceable. We must, therefore, launch all the\nlifecraft--except Number Two, of course--into separate orbits around\nthis sun, so that a properly-staffed and properly-equipped expedition\ncan study it.\"\n\n\"Your proper expedition might get its pants burned off, too.\"\n\n\"There is always that possibility; but I will insist on being assigned\nto the project. This information, young man, is _necessary_.\"\n\n\"O. K., Doc,\" and it was done; and in a few days the _Procyon_ hung\nmotionless, a good five hundred miles high, directly above the highest,\nsharpest mountain peak they had been able to find.\n\nThe Bailey boom, with its spider-web-like network of grounding cables\nand with a large pulley at its end, extended two hundred feet straight\nout from the side of the ship. A twenty-five-mile coil of Graham wire\nwas mounted on the remote-controlled Hotchkiss reel. The end of the wire\nwas run out over the pulley; a fifteen-pound weight, to act both as a\n\"senser\" and to keep the wire from fouling, was attached; and a few\nhundred feet of wire were run out.\n\nThen, in Lifecraft Two--as far away from the \"business district\" as they\ncould get--the human bodies were grounded and Deston started the reel.\nThe wire ran out--and ran--and ran--and ran. The full twenty-five miles\nwere paid out, and still nothing happened. Then, very slowly, Deston let\nthe big ship move straight downward. Until, finally, it happened.\n\nThere was a blast beside which the most terrific flash of lightning ever\nseen on Earth would have seemed like a firecracker. In what was almost a\nvacuum though she was, the whole immense mass of the _Procyon_ was\nhurled upward like the cork out of a champagne bottle. And as for what\nit _felt_ like--since the five who experienced it could never describe\nit, even to each other, it is obviously indescribable by or to anyone\nelse. As Bernice said long afterward, when she was being pressed by a\nnewsman: \"Just tell 'em it was the living end,\" and that is as good a\ndescription as any.\n\nThe girls were unwrapped from their silver-mesh cocoons and, after a\nminute or so of semihysterics, were as good as new. Then Deston stared\ninto the 'scope and gulped. Without saying a word he waved a hand and\nthe others looked. It seemed as though the entire tip of the mountain\nwas gone; had become a seething, flaming volcano on a world that had\nknown no volcanism[3] for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n    [3] Transcriber's note: The original read 'vulcanism'.\n\n\"And what,\" said Deston finally, \"do you suppose happened to the other\nside of the ship?\"\n\nThe boom, of course, was gone. So were all twenty of the grounding\ncables which, each the size of a man's arm, had fanned out in all\ndirections to anchorages welded solidly to the vessel's skin and frame.\nThe anchorages, too, were gone; and tons upon tons of high-alloy steel\nplating and structural members for many feet around where each anchorage\nhad been. Steel had run like water; had been blown away in gusts of\nvapor.\n\n\"Shall I try the radio now, Doc?\" Deston asked.\n\n\"By no means. This first blast would, of course, be the worst, but there\nwill be several more, of decreasing violence.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were. The second, while it volatilized the boom and its grounding\nnetwork, merely fused portions of the anchorages. The third took only\nthe boom itself; the fourth took only the dangling miles of wire. At the\nsixth trial nothing--apparently--happened; whereupon the wire was drawn\nin and a two-hundred-pound mass of steel was lowered until it was in\nfirm and quiescent contact with the solid rock of the planet.\n\n\"Now you may try your radio,\" Adams said.\n\nDeston flipped a switch and spoke, quietly but clearly, into a\nmicrophone. \"_Procyon One_ to Control Six. Flight Eight Four Nine.\nSubspace Radio Test Ninety-Five--I think. How do you read me, Control\nSix?\"\n\nThe reply was highly unorthodox. It was a wild yell, followed by words\nnot directed at Deston at all. \"Captain Reamer! Captain French! Captain\nHolloway! ANYBODY! It's the _Procyon_! The _PROCYON_, that was lost a\nyear ago! Unless some fool is playing a dumb joke.\"\n\n\"It's no joke--I hope.\" Another voice, crisp and authoritative, came in;\ngrowing louder as its source approached the distant pickup. \"Or somebody\nwill rot in jail for a hundred years.\"\n\n\"_Procyon One_ to Control Six,\" Deston said again. His voice was not\nquite steady this time; both girls were crying openly and joyfully. \"How\ndo you read me, Frenchy old horse?\"\n\n\"It _is Procyon One_--the Runt himself--Hi, Babe!\" the new voice roared,\nthen quieted to normal volume. \"I read you eight and one. Survivors?\"\n\n\"Five. Second Officer Jones, our wives, and Dr. Andrew Adams, a Fellow\nof the College of Advanced Study. He's solely responsible for our being\nhere, so----\"\n\n\"Skip that for now. In a lifecraft? No, after this long, it must be the\nship. Not navigable, of course?\"\n\n\"Not in subspace, and only so-so in normal. The Chaytors are O. K., but\nthe whole Top is spun out and the rest of her won't hold air--air, hell!\nShe won't hold shipping crates! All the Wesleys are shot, and all the\nQ-converters. Half the Grahams are leaking like sieves, and----\"\n\n\"Skip that, too. Just a sec--I'll cut in the downstairs recorder. Now\nstart in at your last check and tell us what's happened since.\"\n\n\"It's a long story.\"\n\n\"Unwind it, Runt, I don't give a damn how long it is. Not a\nfull-detailed report, just hit the high spots--but don't leave out\nanything really important.\"\n\n\"Wow!\" Jones remarked, audibly. \"Wottaman Frenchy! Like the ex-urbanite\nsaid to the gardener: 'I don't want you to work hard--just take big\nshovelfulls and lots of 'em per minute'.\"\n\n\"That's enough out of you, Herc my boy. You'll be next. Go ahead, Babe.\"\n\nDeston went ahead, and spoke almost steadily for thirty minutes. He did\nnot mention the gangsters; nor any personal matters. Otherwise, his\nreport was accurate and complete. He had no idea that everything he\nsaid was going out on an Earth-wide hookup; or that many other planets,\nmonitoring constantly all subspace channels, were hooking on. When he\nwas finally released Captain French said, with a chuckle:\n\n\"Off the air for a minute. You've no idea what an uproar this has\nstirred up already. They let them have all your stuff, but we aren't\nputting out a thing until some Brass gets out there and gets the real\nstory----\"\n\n\"That _is_ the real story, damn it!\"\n\n\"Oh, sure, and a very nice job, too, for an extemporaneous effort--if it\nwas. Semantics says, though, that in a couple of spots it smells like\nslightly rancid cheese, and ... no-no, keep still! Too many planets\nlistening in--_verbum sap_. Anyway, THE PRESS smells something, too, and\nthey're screaming their lungs out, especially the sob-sisters. Now,\nHerc, on the air, you're orbiting the fourth planet of a sun. What sun?\nWhere?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Unlisted. We're in completely unexplored territory.\nStandard reference angles are as follows\"--and Jones read off a long\nlist of observations, not only of the brightest stars of the galaxy, but\nalso of the standard reference points, such as S-Doradus, lying outside\nit. \"When you get that stuff all plotted, you'll find a hell of a big\nconfusion; but I _hope_ there aren't enough stars in it but what you can\nfind us sometime.\"\n\n\"Off the air--for good, I hope. Don't make me laugh, Buster, Your\nprobable center will spear it. If there's ever more than one star in any\nconfusion _you_ set up, I'll eat all the extras. But there's a dozen Big\nBrains here, gnawing their nails off up to the wrist to talk to Adams\nall the rest of the night, so put him on and let's get back to sleep,\nhuh? They're cutting this mike now.\"\n\n\"Just a minute!\" Deston snapped. \"What's your time?\"\n\n\"Three, fourteen, thirty-seven. So go back to bed, you night-prowling\nowl.\"\n\n\"Of what day, month, and year?\" Deston insisted.\n\n\"Friday, Sep----\" French's voice was replaced by a much older one; very\nevidently that of a Fellow of the College.\n\nAfter listening for a moment to the newcomer and Adams, Barbara took\nDeston by the arm and led him away. \"Just a little bit of _that_\ngibberish is a bountiful sufficiency, husband mine. So I think we'd\nbetter take Captain French's advice, don't you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSince there was only one star in Jones' \"Confusion\" (by the book,\n\"Volume of Uncertainty\") finding the _Procyon_ was no problem at all.\nHigh Brass came in quantity and the entire story--except for one bit of\nbiology--was told. Two huge subspace-going machine shops also came, and\na thousand mechanics, who worked on the crippled liner for almost three\nweeks.\n\nThen the _Procyon_ started back for Earth under her own subspace drive,\nunder the command of Captain Theodore Jones. His first, last, and only\nsubspace command, of course, since he was now a married man. Deston had\nwanted to resign while still a First Officer, but his superiors would\nnot accept his resignation until his promotion \"for outstanding\nservices\" came through. Thus, Ex-Captain Carlyle Deston and his wife\nwere dead-heading, not quite back to Earth, but to the transfer-point\nfor the planet Newmars.\n\n\"Theodore Warner Deston is going to be born on Newmars, where he should\nbe,\" Barbara had said, and Deston had agreed.\n\n\"But suppose she's Theodora?\" Bernice had twitted her.\n\n\"Uh-uh,\" Barbara had said, calmly. \"I just _know_ he's Theodore.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, I know.\" Bernice had nodded her spectacular head. \"And we\nwanted a girl, so she is. Barbara Bernice Jones, her name is. A living\ndoll.\"\n\nAlthough both pregnancies were well advanced, neither was very near full\nterm. Thus it was clear that both periods of gestation were going to be\nwell over a year in length; but none of the five persons who knew it so\nmuch as mentioned the fact. To Adams it was only one tiny datum in an\nincredibly huge and complex mathematical structure. The parents did not\nwant to be pilloried as crackpots, as publicity-seeking liars, or as\nbeing unable to count; and they knew that nobody would believe them if\nthey told the truth; even--or especially?--no medical doctor. The more\nany doctor knew about gynecology and obstetrics, in fact, the less he\nwould believe any such story as theirs.\n\nOf what use is it to pit such puny and trivial things as _facts_ against\nrock-ribbed, iron-bound, entrenched AUTHORITY?\n\nThe five, however, _knew_; and Deston and Jones had several long and\nhighly unsatisfactory discussions; at first with Adams, and later\nbetween themselves. At the end of the last such discussion, a couple of\nhours out from the transfer point, Jones lit a cigarette savagely and\nrasped:\n\n\"Wherever you start or whatever your angle of approach, he _always_\nboils it down to this: 'Subjective time is measured by the number of\nlearning events experienced.' I ask you, Babe, what does that mean? If\nanything?\"\n\n\"It sounds like it ought to mean _something_, but I'll be damned if I\nknow what.\" Deston gazed thoughtfully at the incandescent tip of his\nfriend's cigarette. \"However, if it makes the old boy happy and gives\nthe College a toehold on subspace, what do _we_ care?\"\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SUBSPACE SURVIVORS***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 21647.txt or 21647.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/1/6/4/21647\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
