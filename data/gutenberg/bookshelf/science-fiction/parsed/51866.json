A figure loomed in a doorway and he snapped off a quick\nblaster shot at it--missed.\n\nHe'd killed one man, wounded others--and was carrying papers stolen\nfrom the secret Embassy files. They had to stop him--but they couldn't!\n\n--And, worlds away, the men of Department 99 watched on their\ngalaxy-spanning view-screen ... knowing they were responsible for this\ndisaster--and powerless to do anything about it!\n\n\n\n\nONE\n\n\nAt the ninety-fifth floor, Westervelt left the public elevator for\na private automatic one which he took four floors further. When he\nstepped out, the dark, lean youth faced an office entrance whose\ndouble, transparent doors bore the discreet legend: \"Department 99.\"\n\nHe crossed the hall and entered. Waving at the little blonde in the\nswitchboard cubby to the right of the doorway, he continued a few steps\ninto the office beyond. Two secretaries looked up from the row of desks\nfacing him, a third place being unoccupied. Behind them, long windows\nfiltered the late afternoon light to a mellow tint.\n\n\"Did you get it all right, Willie?\" asked the dark girl to his left.\n\"Mr. Smith wants you to take it right in. He expected you earlier.\"\n\n\"My flight from London was late; I did the best I could after we\nlanded,\" said Westervelt. \"It took me the whole day to fetch this\ngadget. At least let me get my coat off!\"\n\nHe moved to his right, to a modest desk in an alcove formed by the end\nof the office and the high partition that enclosed the switchboard.\n\n\"How do you find yourself inside that?\" asked the other secretary, a\ngolden haired girl with a lazy smile. \"Talk about women's clothes! The\nmen are wearing topcoats like tents this year.\"\n\nWestervelt felt himself flushing, to his disgust. He struggled out of\nthe coat, removed an oblong package and a large envelope from inner\npockets, and tossed the coat on his desk.\n\nIt had hardly settled before the door at the opposite end of the\noffice, beyond the dark girl, was flung open. From the next room\nlumbered a man who looked even lankier than Westervelt because he was\nan inch or two over six feet tall. His broad forehead was grooved by a\nscowl of concentration that brought heavy eyebrows nearly together over\na high-bridged nose. His chin seemed longer for his chewing nervously\nupon his lower lip. He was in shirtsleeves and badly needed a haircut.\n\n\"I'm going down to the com room, Miss Diorio,\" he told the brunette.\n\"There's another weird report coming in!\"\n\nHe vanished into the hall with a clatter.\n\nHis secretary looked at Westervelt, a smile tugging at the corners of\nher full lips. She threw up her hands with a little flip.\n\n\"I told you to take it right in,\" she reminded him.\n\n\"Aw, come on, Si! What if I'd been in the doorway when he came through?\"\n\n\"What is it, anyway?\" asked the other girl.\n\nWestervelt looked around as she rose. Beryl Austin, he thought, would\nbe a knockout if only there were less of a hint of ice about her. She\nwas, in her high heels, only an inch shorter than he. Her face was\nround, but with a delicate bone structure that lent it an odd beauty.\nWestervelt was privately of the opinion that she spoiled the effect by\nwearing her hair in a style too short and too precisely arranged. _And\ntoo bleached_, he told himself.\n\nThe talk was that before coming to the Department, she had won two or\nthree minor beauty contests. That might explain the meticulous make-up\nand the smart blue dress that followed the curves of her figure so\nflatteringly. Westervelt suspected, from hints dropped by Simonetta\nDiorio, that this was insufficient qualification for being a secretary,\neven in such a peculiar institution as Department 99. Of course, maybe\nSmith had ideas of making her a field agent.\n\nHe held out the package in the palm of his hand.\n\n\"They said at the London lab that it was a special flashlight that\nwould pass for an ordinary one.\"\n\n\"Oh, the one for that Antares case,\" exclaimed Beryl. \"Si was telling\nme how they'll send out plans of that. Did they show you how it works?\"\n\n\"It gives just a dim beam until you press an extra switch,\" said\nWestervelt. \"Then it puts out a series of dashes bright enough to hurt\nyour eyes.\"\n\n\"What in the world do they want that for?\" asked Beryl.\n\n\"What in some other world, you mean! On some of these planets, the\nnative life is so used to a dim red sun that a flash like this on their\nsensitive eyes can knock them unconscious.\"\n\n\"This place is just full of dirty tricks like that,\" said the blonde.\n\"Why can't they free these people some other way?\"\n\nWestervelt and Simonetta looked at each other. Beryl had been in the\nDepartment only a few weeks, and did not yet seem to have heard the\nword.\n\n_Or understood it, maybe_, thought Westervelt. _She might not look half\nso intelligent without that nice chest expansion._\n\n\"Some of them just get in trouble,\" Simonetta was saying. \"The laws of\nalien peoples we've been meeting around the galaxy don't necessarily\nmake sense to Terrans.\"\n\n\"But why can't they stay away from such queer places?\"\n\n\"What would you do,\" asked Westervelt, \"if you were in a spaceship that\nblew up near a strange planetary system, and you took an emergency\nrocket to land on the best looking planet, and the local bems arrested\nyou because they have a law against anyone passing through their system\nwithout special permission?\"\n\n\"But how can they make a law like that?\" demanded Beryl.\n\n\"Who says they can't? They had a war with beings from the star nearest\nthem; and wound up suspicious of every kind of spaceship. We have a\ncase like that now.\"\n\n\"They've been working on it two months,\" Simonetta confirmed. \"Those\npoor men were jailed over a month before anybody even heard about them.\"\n\nBeryl shrugged and turned back to her desk. Westervelt watched her\nwalk, thinking that the rear elevation was good too, until it occurred\nto him that Simonetta might be taking in his expression. The blonde\nsettled herself and leaned back to stretch. He was willing to bet ten\ncredits that she did it just to get his goat.\n\n\"Well, the work is interesting,\" Beryl admitted, \"but I don't see why\nit can't be done by the Department of Interstellar Relations. The\nD.I.R. has trained diplomats and knows all about dealing with aliens.\"\n\n\"Come on, now, dear!\" said Simonetta. \"Where do you think your paycheck\noriginates? Publicly, the D.I.R. doesn't like to admit that we exist.\nTo hide the connection, they named us after the floor we're on in this\nbuilding, and hoped that nobody would notice us.\"\n\n\"I knew I was getting into something crooked!\" exclaimed Beryl.\n\n\"It depends,\" said Westervelt. \"Suppose some Terran spacer is slung\ninto jail out there somewhere, for something that would never be a\ncrime in the Solar System. The D.I.R. protests, and the bems simply\ndeny they have him. How far can diplomacy go? We try getting him out\nsome other way.\"\n\nHe held up the \"flashlight.\"\n\n\"Now they'll stellarfax plans of this out to Antares to our field\nagents. After one is made and smuggled in to our case, all they have to\ndo is run in a fast ship to pick him up when he breaks out.\"\n\n\"Speaking of that gadget,\" Simonetta suggested, \"why don't you take it\ndown to Mr. Smith? He must be waiting out the message in the com room.\"\n\nWestervelt agreed. He took the package and the envelope of blueprints,\nand walked into the hall. He turned first to his right, along the base\nof the U-shaped corridor, then to his left after passing the door to\nthe fire stairs at the inner corner and the private entrance to Smith's\noffice opposite it.\n\nThe walls were covered by a gray plastic that was softly monotonous in\nthe light of the luminous ceiling. The floor, nearly black, was of a\nspringy composition that deadened the sound of footfalls.\n\nAlong the wing of the \"U\" into which he turned, Westervelt passed doors\nto the department's reference library and to a conference room on his\nright, and portal marked \"Shaft\" on his left. Beyond the latter was a\nsection of blank wall behind which, he knew, was a special shaft for\nthe power conduits that supplied the department's own communications\ninstruments.\n\nThe place was a self-sufficient unit, he reflected. It had its own\nTV equipment and a sub-space radio for reaching far-out spaceships,\nalthough most routine traffic was boosted through relay stations on the\nouter planets of the Solar System.\n\nSome lines of communication with the field agents were tenuous, but\nmessages usually got through. If the lines broke down, someone would be\nsent to search the confidential files for a roundabout connection.\n\n_I wonder how many of us would wind up in court if those files became\npublic knowledge?_ thought Westervelt. _I'd like to see them trying to\nhandle Smitty! Nobody here can figure him out all the time, and we're\nat least half as nutty as he is._\n\nDown beside the communications room, though normally reached by the\nother wing of the corridor that enclosed the core of elevators, shafts\nand rest rooms, the department even had a confidential laboratory.\nActually, this was more in the nature of a stock room for peculiar\ngadgets and implements used for the fell purposes of the organization.\nWestervelt did not like to wander about in there, for fear of setting\nsomething off. It was more or less the domain of the one man in the\ndepartment whom he knew to have been in an alien prison.\n\nRobert Lydman was an ex-spacer who had joined the group after having\nbeen rescued from just such an incarceration as he now specialized in\ncracking. Westervelt had been told that the sojourn among the stars had\nleft Lydman a trifle strange, which was probably why they no longer\nused him as a field agent.\n\nHe came to the blank end of the corridor, the last door on the right\nbeing that of the communications room. He opened it and stuck his head\ninside.\n\nThe room was dimmer than the corridor. The operators, who sometimes\nhad to contend with much-relayed faint images on their screens, liked\nit that way. They kept the window filters adjusted so that it might\nas well be night outside. Here and there, small lights glowed at\nvarious radio receivers or tape recording instruments, and there was a\npervading background rustle of static blended with quiet whistles and\nmutterings.\n\nAt the moment, the operator on duty was Charlie Colborn, a quiet\nredhead who kept a locker full of electronic gadgets for tinkering\nduring slow periods. Smith sat near him in a straight-backed chair,\nwatching the screen before Colborn.\n\nA message was coming in from the Pluto relay--Westervelt recognized\nthe distant operator who spoke briefly to Colborn before putting the\nmessage through. The next face, blurry from repeated boosting of the\nimage, was that of a stranger.\n\n\"This is Johnson, on Trident,\" the man said. \"Capella IV tells me they\ngave you the facts about Harris. That right?\"\n\nSmith hitched himself closer, so the transmitter lens could pick him\nup. Westervelt tip-toed inside and found himself a stool.\n\n\"We just got the outlines,\" Smith said. \"You say this spacer is being\nheld by the natives, and they won't let you communicate with him. Have\nyou reported to the D.I.R.?\"\n\nThe distance and the relaying caused a few seconds of lag, even with\nthe ultra-modern sub-space equipment.\n\n\"I _am_ the D.I.R.,\" said the face on the screen, after a bitter pause.\n\"Along with several other jobs, commercial and official. There are only\na few of us Terrans at this post, you know. The natives won't even\nadmit they have him.\"\n\n\"Then how can you be sure they do? And why can't you get to him\nsomehow?\"\n\n\"We know because he managed to get a message out--we think.\" Johnson\nfrowned doubtfully. \"That is, he did if we can believe the ... ah ...\nmessenger. We made inquiries of the natives, but it is impossible\nto make much of an investigation because their civilization is an\nunderwater one.\"\n\nSmith noticed Westervelt.\n\n\"Willie,\" he whispered hastily, \"get on the phone and have one of the\ngirls stop in the library and fetch me the volume of the _Galatlas_\nwith Trident in it.\"\n\nWestervelt dropped his package on a table and punched Beryl's number on\nthe nearest phone. Meanwhile, with its weird pauses, the interstellar\ntalk continued.\n\nThe missing Terran, Harris by name, had insisted against all advice at\nthe outpost on one of the watery planet's few islands, upon conducting\nsubmarine exploration in a converted space scout. Since ninety-five\npercent of the surface of Trident was ocean, Johnson had only a vague\nidea of where Harris had gone. The point was that the explorer had\nbeen too long out of touch. The natives, a sea people of crustacean\nevolution, who were to be found over most of the ocean bottom, and who\nhad a considerable culture with permanent cities and jet-propelled\nsubmarine vehicles, admitted to having heard of Harris but denied\nknowledge of his whereabouts.\n\n\"So we reported to the D.I.R. sector headquarters,\" Johnson concluded.\n\"They sent an expert to coax the Tridentian officials into visiting the\nshallows for a conference, but nothing came of it. Then we called in\none of your field agents and he referred us to you.\"\n\nBeryl entered the room quietly, bearing a large book. Westervelt held\nout his hand for it, but she seemed not to see him until he rose to\noffer her the stool. When he turned his attention back to the screen,\nSmith was probing for information which the distant Johnson sounded\nreluctant to give.\n\n\"But if they deny everything, how do you know he's not dead instead of\nbeing held in one of their cities? Why do you think he's being made a\nsort of exhibit?\"\n\nJohnson hemmed and hawed, but finally confessed.\n\nBesides the crustaceans, who were about man-sized and\n\"civilized,\" there was another form of intelligent--or at least\nsemi-intelligent--life on Trident. Certain large, fish-like inhabitants\nof the planet's seas had been contacted more than once to deliver\nmessages to the exploring members of the outpost. This was always\npromptly accomplished by having one of the \"fish\" contact another of\nthe same species who was in the right location.\n\n\"_What_ did you say?\" demanded Smith. \"Telepathic? A telepathic _fish_?\nOh, no! Don't ask us to--Well, what I mean is ... well, how do you know\nthey're reliable?\"\n\nMore in the same vein followed. Westervelt stopped listening when he\nrealized that Smith was being convinced, willing or not. Stranger\nthings were on record in the immensity of the known galaxy, but Smith\ntook the attitude that they were all a plot against Department 99.\nWestervelt pried the book from Beryl's grasp and turned over pages to\nthe article on the planet Trident.\n\nHe skimmed the opening, which dealt with galactic co-ordinates and the\ntype of star at the center of the system, and did the same with the\ngeneral description of the surface and what was known of the life forms\nthere. The history since discovery was laconically brief.\n\n_Here it is_, he told himself. _A species of life resembling a Terran\nfish in general configuration, about twenty feet in length and\nsuspected of having some undetermined sense whereby individuals can\nlocate each other at great distances. Well, by the time it's in print,\nit's outdated._\n\nSomeone turned on a brighter light, and he realized the interstellar\ntalk was at an end. Smith looked around. He held out his hand for the\nbook, seeming to take for granted that someone should have found the\npage.\n\n\"I don't see _how_ we're going to reach this one,\" he grunted, plopping\nthe volume down on the table to scan the article.\n\nColborn snatched at a small piece of apparatus he had evidently been\nassembling. Only Beryl was impressed; the others knew that Smith said\nthis of every new case.\n\n\"Tell Mr. Lydman and Mr. Parrish I want a conference,\" the department\nhead requested. \"We'll use the room next door.\"\n\nBeryl and Westervelt left Colborn examining his gadget suspiciously and\nretraced their steps up the corridor. At the door to the main office,\nthe blonde left him, presumably to go through to the corner office\noccupied by Parrish, whose secretary she was. Westervelt dwelt on the\nthought of sending her on the way with a small pat, but forced himself\nto continue up the other wing of the \"U.\"\n\nHe passed two doors on his left: another conference room and a spare\noffice used mainly for old files. Doors to his right led to washrooms.\nThis end of the hall was not blank as on the other side; it had a\ndoor labeled \"Laboratory--No Admittance.\" The last door to the left,\ncorresponding to the location of the communications room, led to\nLydman's office.\n\nWestervelt knocked, waited for the sound of a voice inside, and walked\nin. For a moment, he saw no one, then pivoted to his right as he\nremembered that Lydman kept his desk on the inner wall, around the\nshort corner behind the door. Everyone else who had a corner office sat\nout by the windows.\n\nHe found himself facing a heavy man whose bleached crewcut and tanned\nfeatures bespoke much time spent outdoors. Very beautiful eyes of a\ndark gray-blue regarded him steadily until Westervelt felt a panicky\nurge to run.\n\nInstead, he cleared his throat and gave Smith's message. Lydman always\nhad the same effect upon him for the first few minutes, although he\nseemed to like Westervelt better than anyone else at the office, even\nto the point of inviting him home for weekends of swimming.\n\n_I always get the feeling that he looks right through me and back\nagain,_ thought Westervelt, _but I can't see an inch into him!_\n\n\n\n\nTWO\n\n\nCastor P. Smith sat at the head of a steel and plastic table in\nthe conference room, whistling thoughtfully as he waited for his\nassistants. Next door in the communications room, the tortured tune his\nlips emitted would have been treated as deliberate jamming. Simonetta\nDiorio entered carrying a recorder, and he roused himself for a smile\nof appreciation.\n\n\"You won't forget to turn it on when you start, Mr. Smith?\" she pleaded.\n\n\"I'll keep my finger on the switch until then,\" he grinned. \"Thanks,\nSi.\"\n\nLeft alone again, he told himself he would have to do something\nabout the reputation he was acquiring--quite without foundation, he\nbelieved--for being absent minded. After all, he was hardly likely to\nforget to record a conference when it had been his own idea. So many\nideas were tossed around on a good day that some were bound to be lost,\nunless they were down on tape. Even a good steno like Simonetta could\nnot guarantee to keep up with it all when two or three got to talking\nat once.\n\nGenerally, he admitted to himself, he erased the tape without the\nnecessity of filing some brilliant solution. Still, the one in a\nthousand that did turn up made the precaution worthwhile.\n\nHe stared morosely at the volume of the _Galatlas_ he had brought from\nthe communications room. Sometimes, in this job, he lost his sense of\ngalactic direction. Calls were likely to come in from stars of which he\nhad never heard.\n\n_Wish I could get a little more help from the D.I.R._, he thought.\n_It's more than having one secretary on vacation just now; we're always\nshort-handed. They never brought us up to strength since old Murphy\nblew himself up in the lab with that little redhead. Maybe Willie will\ngrow into something. That will take years, though. We ought to have\nsome kind of training school._\n\nIn Smith's opinion, he should have had a larger force of full time\nagents in the field, but he recognized the difficulties inherent\nin the immensity of Terran-influenced space. Even recruiting was a\nhit-or-miss process. He had made various working arrangements out of\nchance contacts with independent spacers--he supposed that it was\nunofficially expected of him--and most had worked out well. About a\ndozen routine cases were currently being handled out there somewhere\nby a motley group of his own men and piratical temporary help. In\naddition, there were three hot cases that had required supervision from\nheadquarters.\n\n_I wonder if we should stay a little late tonight?_ he asked himself.\n_I hate to ask them again, but who knows what will break with this new\nskull-cracker?_\n\nHe looked up as Pete Parrish entered. His dapper assistant walked\naround the other end of the table and took a seat on the window side.\n\n\"I hear you have another one,\" he greeted Smith.\n\nParrish was a trim man of thirty-six or thirty-seven, just about\naverage in height but slim enough to seem taller. Smith was aware that\nthe other took considerable pains to maintain that slimness. By his own\naccount, he rode well and played a fast game of squash.\n\nThe wave in his dark hair was somewhat suppressed by careful grooming.\nHe smiled frequently, or at least made a show of gleaming teeth; but at\nother times his neat, regular features were disciplined into a perfect\nmask.\n\n_Thank God that he doesn't wear a mustache!_ thought Smith. _That would\nput him over the brink._\n\nHe was reasonably certain that Parrish had given the idea careful\ncalculation and stopped just short of the brink. That would be typical\nof the man. He had been at one time a publicist, then a salesman, on\nTerra and in space. Actually, he should have been a confidence man. It\nwas not until the Department had stumbled across him that he had found\nopportunity to exercise his real talents. He was expert at estimating\nalien psychology and constructing rationalizations with which to thwart\nit.\n\nSmith realized, self-consciously, that he had been staring through\nParrish. He passed one hand down the back of his neck, reminding\nhimself that he must get a haircut. He could not imagine why he kept\nforgetting; it occurred to him every time he faced Parrish. He decided\nfurther to wear a freshly pressed suit the next day.\n\nLydman padded in, glanced about the room, and sat down as near to the\ndoor as he could without leaving an obvious gap between himself and the\nothers. He eyed Parrish briefly, and raised one hand to check the scarf\nat his throat. Lydman dressed unobtrusively, and probably would have\npreferred an old-fashioned tie to the bright neck scarves favored by\ncurrent fashion.\n\n_I wonder why I get all the nuts?_ Smith asked himself, avoiding\nthe beautiful eyes by looking squarely between them. _Even the\ngirls--people with romantic ideas of cloak and dagger work, or the ones\nthat owe us favors, keep sending us peaches. Then they marry off, or go\naround acting so secretive that they draw attention to us._\n\nSometimes, he had to admit, he would have preferred having a babe marry\nand leave the department. Parrish was often helpful in such situations,\nwhich was only fair since he created most of them. Twice divorced, the\nassistant had lost none of his interest in women. He was as clever at\nfeminine psychology as at alien.\n\n\"Well, I suppose you've heard something of the new squawk,\" Smith said\nto break the silence. \"I just don't see how we're going to reach this\none. The damned fool got himself taken on an ocean bottom.\"\n\nHe proceeded to outline the facts so far reported. Parrish received\nthem impassively; Lydman began to scowl. The ex-spacer developed\nspecial grudges against aliens who attempted to conceal the detention\nof Terrans.\n\n\"First, let's see where we are before we tackle this,\" suggested Smith.\n\"I've given you enough on Harris to let it percolate through your minds\nwhile we review the other cases. It looks like something we should all\nbe in on.\"\n\nSometimes he would put a case in the charge of one of them, but they\nwere accustomed to exchanging information and advice.\n\n\"This business of the two spacers who were nailed for unauthorized\nentry in the Syssokan system seems about ripe,\" he reminded them.\n\"Taranto and Meyers, you remember.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Lydman in a withdrawn tone. \"The dope.\"\n\n\"That's right. There was no trouble getting information about them,\njust in comprehending the idiot reasoning that would maintain a law\nthat makes it a crime to crash-land on that planet. Terra, like any\nother stellar government, is permitted one official resident there.\nFortunately, we got the D.I.R. to slip him a little memo about us\nbefore he was sent out, and this is the outcome. They may even be on\nthe loose right now.\"\n\n\"Let me see,\" mused Parrish. \"Bob gave you the formula for something\nthat practically suspends animation, didn't he?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Lydman. \"We figured on the bastards to carry the bodies\nout and dump them. A bunch of tramp spacers is standing by to pick them\nup.\"\n\n\"No reason why it shouldn't work,\" said Smith. \"Variations of it have\nbeen keeping us in business. Some day we'll slip up just by relying on\nit too much, but this looks okay. How is your Greenhaven case coming,\nPete?\"\n\nParrish hesitated before answering. He stroked the edge of the table\nwith well manicured fingertips as he considered.\n\n\"Maria Ringstad,\" he said thoughtfully. \"These reporters should be more\ncareful, should have some knowledge of the cultures they poke into.\nGreenhaven is hardly a colony to swash a buckle through. I suppose she\nnever thought they would bother a newswoman.\"\n\n\"Did you ever get the answer to what she was after on Greenhaven?\"\n\n\"Nothing, just passing through!\" Parrish snapped his fingers in\ncontempt. \"She was on a space liner enroute to Altair VII to gather\nmaterial for a book. It stopped on Greenhaven to deliver a consignment\nof laboratory instruments.\"\n\n\"Those Greenies,\" Lydman put in, \"are as crazy as bems. What a way to\nlive!\"\n\n\"They _have_ been described as the bluest colony ever derived from\nTerra,\" agreed Smith. \"I shudder to think of the life Pete would lead\nthere.\"\n\nParrish smiled, but not very deeply.\n\n\"Miss Ringstad's mistake was fairly simple-minded,\" he said. \"They\nhad official prices posted in that shop she visited for souvenirs.\nWhen they claimed to be out of the article she fancied, she had the\nbad taste to offer a bonus price. On Greenhaven, this is regarded as\nbribery, immorality, and economic subversion, to touch merely upon the\nhighlights.\"\n\nSmith sighed.\n\n\"Why will these young girls run around doing--\"\n\n\"I don't believe you could call her a girl, exactly,\" Parrish\ninterrupted.\n\n\"Well, this lady, then....\"\n\n\"I wouldn't guarantee that either.\"\n\nSmith shrugged and pursed his lips. \"You'd be a better judge than I,\"\nhe admitted innocently. \"I yield to superior qualifications.\"\n\nLydman grinned. Parrish maintained his mask.\n\n\"I suppose that might make it even more dangerous for her,\" Smith went\non. \"I forget what you said the sentence was, but suppose she starts to\nget smart in jail. Would any snappy Terran humor pass there?\"\n\n\"By no means!\" said Parrish emphatically. \"I would not expect them to\nburn her at the stake in this day and age, but they _would_ talk about\nit as being one of the good old ways. Fortunately, their speaking and\nwriting Terran makes this easy. Terrans are all black sinners, but\nplenty of Terrans are necessary around the spaceports. We keep a few\nagents among them. One of them is going to pull the paper trick to\nspring her.\"\n\n\"I'd rather leave them a bomb,\" said Lydman, almost to himself.\n\nSmith frequently wondered that such a rugged man should speak in so\nquiet a voice. At times, Lydman used a monotone that was barely audible.\n\n\"We hope to destroy all evidence,\" added Parrish. \"Otherwise, it will\nlead to the usual diplomatic notes, and the D.I.R. will be telling us\nwe never were authorized to do any such thing.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Smith, nodding wearily. \"Actually, you couldn't find our\nspecific duties written down anywhere; and there is _nothing_ we are\nforbidden to do either--as long as it succeeds. Well, none of us will\nsee the day when the D.I.R. will publicly recognize us to the extent\nof chopping our heads into the basket. They _have_ been yapping at me,\nthough, for drawing complaints in the Gerson case.\"\n\nLydman had been sitting with his gaze narrowed upon a pencil gripped in\nhis big fists. Now he raised his head, scenting interference in his own\nproject.\n\n\"How can the Yoleenites complain? They claim they don't even have\nGerson!\"\n\n\"Easy!\" Smith soothed him. \"We have an embassy and spaceport there,\nremember, that you've been relying on. You had them make some\ninquiries, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Had to confirm the report somehow. All we had was the story of a\nkidnapping from the captain of that freighter. It might not have been\ntrue.\"\n\n\"I realize that,\" said Smith.\n\n\"It wouldn't have been the first time a spacer got left behind because\nhe didn't make countdown--or because they didn't want him around at\npayoff.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Parrish agreed smoothly. \"You could tell us about that.\"\n\nLydman turned to look at him, so suddenly that a silence fell among\nthem. Parrish averted his gaze uncomfortably, and reached into the\nbreast pocket of his maroon jacket for a box of cigarettes. He busied\nhimself puffing one alight from the chemical lighter set in the bottom\nof the box.\n\n_One day I'll have to pull them apart_, thought Smith, _and I'm not big\nenough. Where does my wife get the nerve to say the neighbors don't\nknow what to make of an average guy like me, just because I can't talk\nabout my work?_\n\n\"At any rate,\" he said quietly, \"they took the attitude that even to\nask them about the incident was insulting. It seemed to rock the top\nbrass.\"\n\n\"What do _they_ know about Yoleen?\" growled Lydman, giving up his\nscrutiny of Parrish.\n\n\"Not a thing, probably. They make decisions on the basis of how many\ntoes they've stubbed lately. Right now, it sounds like only routine\npanic. That reminds me--I meant to check with Emil Starke about that.\"\n\nHe shoved back his chair and stepped over to a phone table nearby.\nSwitching on both screen and sound, he waited until the cute little\nblonde at the board came on.\n\n\"Pauline, get me Emil Starke at the D.I.R., please. Extension 1563.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Smith,\" said Pauline and disappeared from the screen.\n\nIn a few moments, Smith was greeting a man of about fifty, gray at the\ntemples to the point of appearing over-distinguished.\n\n\"Listen, Emil,\" he said, getting down to business after the amenities\nabout families and children had been observed. \"I have a case on my\nhands concerning a planet named Yoleen--\"\n\nThe man on the screen was already nodding.\n\n\"Yes, I heard they were chewing you about that this morning,\" he said,\nsmiling. \"I trust you preserved some sort of sang-froid?\"\n\n\"What's in their minds?\" asked Smith.\n\n\"Oh ... it seems that the Space Force is nervous over the Yoleenites.\nThey are unable to evaluate the culture comfortably. To cover\nthemselves, I imagine, they send a warning now and then on the\npossibilities of hostile relations.\"\n\n\"Anything to it?\"\n\nStarke grimaced briefly.\n\n\"Unlikely. Some of the lads upstairs let it make them nervous.\"\n\nSmith chuckled. \"Upstairs,\" they came and went, but Starke and men like\nhim ran things and knew what went on.\n\n\"Then I can go ahead without covering my tracks too deeply?\" he asked.\n\"I mean, I won't have to lie openly to my boss?\"\n\n\"Give him a few days to see the other side,\" Starke assured him, \"and\nhe will be demanding to know why you have not taken steps. Have them\ntaken by then!\"\n\nSmith thanked him for the advice, switched off, and returned to his\nplace at the table. Nods from the others confirmed that they had heard.\n\n\"I have a feeling about those Yoleenites,\" grumbled Lydman.\n\nSmith waited for elucidation, but the big man had sunk into\ncontemplation. The other two eyed him, then each other. Parrish\nshrugged ever so slightly. Smith gnawed at his lower lip.\n\n\"Well, then, you'll be going ahead with what you planned,\" he reminded\nLydman.\n\n\"Oh, sure!\" answered the ex-spacer, snapping out of it. \"Can't help it.\nI've already sent him something useful.\"\n\nThe others smiled. \"Something useful\" was Lydman's term for a cleverly\ndesigned break-out instrument. Smith hoped that in this case it would\nnot turn out to be a bomb.\n\n\"We dug a little mechanical crawler out of the files,\" Lydman went\non. \"The Yoleenites seem to build their cities like a conglomeration\nof pueblos, very intricate and with hardly any open streets. There\nwould probably be a hundred routes in to Gerson, even if we knew\nexactly where he is. This gadget is adjusted to home on certain body\ntemperatures which it can detect at some distance.\"\n\n\"And Gerson would be the only living thing there at ninety-eight point\nsix.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Of course, the thing has a general direction and search\npattern micro-taped in. That's the best they could do, because the boys\nhave only a rough idea of where the cell would be.\"\n\n\"It sounds too easy to intercept,\" objected Parrish.\n\n\"That worries me a little,\" admitted Lydman. \"It would be worse to fly\nsomething in, and it's impossible to send anyone in because they say\nthey haven't got him. The gadget is set to have an affinity for dark\ncorners, at least.\"\n\n\"And how does it get him out?\" pursued Parrish.\n\n\"It carries a little pocket music player with micro-tapes that will\nactually play for a couple of hours. They can't tell for sure that\nGerson didn't have it with him--if they spot it at all. When he opens\nthe back as a little jingle in the first tune will instruct him to do,\nhe has a miniature torch hot enough to cut the guts out of any lock\nbetween him and the outside.\"\n\n\"Someone will be watching for him, I suppose?\" asked Smith.\n\n\"Sure. Once he's out of the place, the Yoleenites can hardly demand\nthat we give back what they say they never had. Off to the embassy with\nhim and onto the first ship! And I hope he kills a few of the bastards\non the way out--they won't even have grounds for an official complaint!\"\n\nThe other two avoided looking at him for a moment. Parrish stirred\nuneasily.\n\n\"I hope it--What I mean is, these Yoleenites give me an uneasy feeling\nthe same as they do you, Bob. Experience tells me that some of these\nhive-like cultures think along peculiar lines. No wonder the Space\nForce finds them hard to understand! I recommend that we open a general\nfile on them.\"\n\n\"It might be just as well,\" Smith agreed, considering. \"They may give\nus more business in the future.\"\n\nHe pushed back his chair and rose.\n\n\"Let's take a break while I see if any new reports have come in. Then\nmaybe we can work out something on the new mess.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHREE\n\n\nLouis Taranto sat on his heels against the baked clay wall of the\ncell, watching the sweat run down the face of his companion. Though\nhe privately considered Harvey Meyers a very weak link, he had so\nfar restrained himself from hinting as much. They were in this hole\ntogether, and he might well need the blubbery loudmouth's help to get\nout--if there were any way to get out.\n\nMeyers sat on the single bench with which their jailers had provided\nthem, staring mournfully at the rude table upon which he rested his\nelbows. He was unusually quiet, as if the heat had drained him of all\nanxiety.\n\n_Sloppy bum!_ thought Taranto. _He could at least comb his hair!_\n\nThey were allowed occasional access to toilet articles which the\nSyssokans had obtained from the one Terran officially in residence on\nthe planet. Taranto had shaved the day before, but the other had not\nbothered for more than a week. Meyers was perhaps an inch short of six\nfeet and must weigh two hundred pounds Terran. He had a loose mouth\nbetween pudgy cheeks. His little blue eyes seemed always to be prying\nexcept during periods such as the present when he was feeling sorry for\nhimself. He had been a medic in the same spaceship in which Taranto had\nbeen a ventilation mechanic.\n\n\"Glad I was never sick,\" Taranto muttered to himself.\n\nMeyers looked up.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"I said I'm glad I was never sick,\" repeated Taranto deliberately,\nthinking, _Let him figure that out if he can!_\n\n\"This heat's enough to make anybody sick,\" complained Meyers. \"Why do\nthey have to keep us up on the top floor of the tower, anyway?\"\n\n\"You expect a luxury suite in the cellar? What kind of jail were you\never in where the prisoners got the best?\"\n\n\"Who says I was ever in jail?\" demanded Meyers defensively.\n\nTaranto grinned slightly, but made no reply. After a moment, the\nother returned to his study of the table. He breathed in loudly, his\nshoulders heaving as if he had been running. To avoid the sight,\nTaranto let his eyes wander for the thousandth time around the walls of\nthe square cell.\n\nThe large blocks of baked clay were turning from dun to gray in the\ntwilight seeping through the four small window openings. Overhead,\nthey curved together to form a high arch that was the peak of the\ntower. Besides table and bench, the room contained a clay water jug a\nyard high, a wooden bucket, a battered copper cooking pot, and a pile\nof coarse straw upon which lay the two gray shirts the spacers had\ndiscarded in the heat. In the center of the floor was a wooden trap\ndoor which Taranto eyed speculatively.\n\nHe reminded himself that he must suppress his longing to smash the next\nSyssokan head that appeared in the opening.\n\n\"It's getting near time,\" he remarked after a few minutes.\n\nMeyers peered at the patches of sky revealed by the windows. They were\nlosing the glare of Syssokan daylight. There had been a wisp or two\nof cloud earlier, but these had either blown over or faded into the\ndeepening gray of the sky.\n\n\"Listen at the door!\" ordered Taranto, impatient at having to remind\nthe other.\n\nHe rose, wiped perspiration from his face with the palms of both hands,\nand rubbed them in turn on the thighs of his gray pants. He was inches\nshorter than Meyers, and twenty pounds or more lighter, but his bare\nshoulders bulged powerfully. A little fat softened the lines of his\nbelly without concealing the existence of an underlying layer of solid\nmuscle. He moved with a heavy, padding gait, like a large carnivore\nwhose natural grace is revealed only at top speed.\n\nMeyers watched him resentfully.\n\n_Why couldn't I have made it to one of the other emergency rockets?_ he\nasked himself. _Imagine a bunch of crazy savages that say even landing\nhere is a crime!_\n\nHe supposed that Taranto would have pointed to the sizable city where\nthey were held if he had heard the Syssokans called savages. Meyers\nthought the trouble with Taranto was that he was too physical, too\nmuch of a dumb flunky who spoiled Meyers' efforts to talk them out of\ntrouble.\n\n_I had a better break coming_, he thought.\n\nHe wished he had been in a rocket with one of the ship's officers who\nmight have known about Syssoka. They would have gone into an orbit\nabout the planet's star and put out a call for help to the nearest\nTerran base or ship. As it was, they might be given up for lost even if\nthe other rockets were picked up. The course they had been on before\nthe explosion had been designed to pass this system by a good margin.\n\nTaranto, he recalled, had thought them lucky to have picked up the\nplanet on the little escape ship's instruments. Taranto, decided\nMeyers, thought he was a hot pilot because he had been a few years in\nspace. He had not looked so good bending the rocket across that ridge\nof rock out in the desert. They should have taken a chance on coming\ndown in the city here.\n\nThey had just about straightened themselves out after that landing\nwhen they had seen the party of Syssokans on the way. It had not taken\nthem long to reach the wreck. They could even speak Terran, and no\npidgin-Terran either. Then it turned out that they did not like spacers\nof any race landing without permission. There had been a war with the\nnext star system; and the laws now said there should be only one alien\nof any race permitted to reside on Syssoka except for brief visits by\nlicensed spaceships.\n\n\"What's the matter with our government?\" muttered Meyers.\n\n\"What?\" asked Taranto, turning from one of the windows.\n\n\"I said what's the matter with the Terran Government? Why don't they\npitch a couple of bombs down here, an' show these skinny nuts who's\nrunning the galaxy? Who are they to call us aliens?\"\n\nTaranto turned again to the eighteen inch square window, set like the\nother three in the center of its wall at the level of his shoulders.\n\n\"They're posting their sentries on the city wall for the night,\" he\ntold Meyers. \"The thing should be flying in here any time now.\"\n\n\"_If_ it comes,\" said Meyers grumpily. \"Something will go wrong with\nthat too.\"\n\nThe other spat out the window that faced the main part of the Syssokan\ncity, then padded to the one opposite. Strange patterns of stars\ngleamed already in the sky over the desert. The air that blew against\nhis damp face was a trifle cooler.\n\n_Should I tell the slob about that?_ he wondered. _Naw--he'd try to\nbreathe it all! Let him sweat, as long as he listens for the Syssokans!_\n\nMeyers had left his bench to crouch over the trap door. There was\nno reason to expect their jailers, but the Syssokans had a habit of\npopping up at odd times. The evening meal was usually brought well\nafter dark, however.\n\n\"Do you think it will really get here again?\" asked Meyers. \"What if\nthey spot it?\"\n\nTaranto grunted. He was watching something he thought was one of the\nflying insects that thickened the Syssokan twilight. Seconds later, he\nducked away from the window as a pencil-sized thing with two pairs of\nflailing wings darted through the opening.\n\nIt whirled about the dim cell. Meyers flapped his hands about his head.\nThe third time around, the insect passed within Taranto's reach; and he\nbatted it out of the air with a feline sweep of his left hand. It fell\nagainst the base of the wall and twitched for a few minutes.\n\nMeyers squinted at him, examining the slightly flattened nose and the\nmeaty cheeks that gave Taranto a deceptively plump look.\n\n\"You're quick, all right,\" he admitted. \"They used to say in the ship\nthat you were a boxer. What made you a spacer?\"\n\n\"Too short,\" said Taranto laconically. \"Five-eight, an' I grew into a\nlight-heavy.\"\n\n\"What did that have to do with it?\"\n\n\"I did all right for a while. When I could get in on them, they'd go\ndown an' stay down. Then they learned to stick an' run on me. It was\neither grow a longer arm or quit.\"\n\n\"Maybe you should have quit sooner,\" said Meyers, for no good reason\nexcept that he resented Taranto and blamed him for their predicament.\n\n\"Why should I?\" asked Taranto, with a cold stare. \"It was good money.\nEven after having my eyebrows fixed, I got a nice nest-egg back on\nTerra. Nothing really shows on me except the habit of a short haircut.\"\n\nMeyers ran his fingers through his own unkempt hair.\n\n\"What was that for?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh ... it don't wave in the air so much when you stop a jab. Looks\nbetter, to the judges.\"\n\nMeyers grunted. _He'd like to believe it doesn't show on him!_ he\nthought.\n\nSuddenly, he bent down to place an ear against the trap door. A\npetulant grimace twisted his features.\n\n\"They're on the ladder,\" he whispered. \"Wouldn't you know?\"\n\nHe straightened up and walked softly back to his bench. Taranto\nremained at the window. It was a perfectly natural place for him to be,\nhe decided.\n\nA few moments later, the trap door creaked up, letting yellow light\nburst into the cell. It came from a clumsy electric lantern in\nthe grip of the first Syssokan who climbed into the chamber. Two\nothers followed, suggestively fingering pistols that would have been\nconsidered crude on Terra two centuries earlier.\n\nThe individual with the light was typical of his race, a tall,\ncadaverous humanoid with pale, greenish-gray skin made up of tiny\nscales. His nose was flatter than that of a Terran ape, and his chin\nconsisted mostly of a hanging fold of scaly skin. His ears were set\nvery low on a narrow, pointed skull. Occasionally, they made small\nmotions as if to fold in upon themselves.\n\nThe Syssokans were clad in garments not unlike loose, sleeveless\npajamas, over which they wore leather harness for their weapons. The\nleader's suit was red, but the other two wore a dull brown.\n\n\"Iss all ssatissfactory?\" asked the one in charge, staring about the\ncell with large, black eyes.\n\n\"All right,\" said Taranto stonily.\n\nHe thought that a Syssokan would never have answered that way. They\nwere vain of their extraordinary linguistic ability, and commonly spoke\nthree or four alien tongues. Only an unfortunate inability to control\nexcessive sibilance marred their Terran. Taranto felt like wiping his\nface, but realized that it was only sweat.\n\nThe Syssokan prowled around the room, examining each of the simple\nfurnishings with a flickering glance. He took note of the food left in\nthe copper pot. He checked the level of water in the big jar. He found\nthe dead insect, which he sniffed and slipped into a pouch at his belt.\nWhen he passed Taranto, the latter eyed him in measuring fashion.\n\nThe Syssokan halted out of reach.\n\n\"You have been warned to obey all orderss here,\" he said, staring\nbetween the two Terrans.\n\n\"What's the trouble now?\" demanded Meyers when it became apparent that\nthe poker-faced Taranto intended to say nothing.\n\n\"There wass a quesstion by the Terran we allow on the world. How can he\nknow of your complaints? He was told only or your ssentence.\"\n\n\"We told you there would be protests from our government,\" said\nMeyers. \"All we did was land on your planet in an emergency: We're only\ntoo willing to leave. You have no right to keep us locked up in these\nconditions.\"\n\n\"It iss a violation of our law,\" said the Syssokan imperturbably. \"You\ngo automatically to jail. We permit only one of every sky people to\nlive here. Who could tell yours that you complain of thiss place?\"\n\n\"Listen, you better be careful of us Terrans!\" blustered Meyers. \"We\nhave ways--\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" said Taranto without raising his voice.\n\nHe had inched forward, but stopped now as the two guards at the trap\ndoor gave him their attention.\n\nThe Syssokan with the lantern also turned to him. Taranto looked over\nthe latter's shoulder. The window was black; the twilight of Syssoka\nwas brief.\n\nMeyers had flushed and was scowling at him with out-thrust lower lip,\nbut Taranto's icy order had spilled the wind from his sails.\n\n\"Perhapss you have had too much water,\" suggested the Syssokan,\nregarding Taranto with interest. \"If you have done ssomething, it iss\nbesst to tell me.\"\n\nTaranto returned the stare. He wondered why all the Syssokans he had\nseen, though rather fragile in build, were relatively thick-waisted.\nThey looked to him as if a couple of solid hooks to the body would find\na soft target.\n\nIt was unlikely that the Syssokan could read the facial expression of\nan alien Terran. It was probably some tenseness in Taranto's stance\nthat caused the native to step back.\n\nThe Terran strained his ears to pick up any unusual noise outside the\nwindow during the pause. He heard nothing except the whir of night\ninsects.\n\nTheir jailer paced once more around the cell, and Taranto cursed\nhimself for arousing suspicion. Perhaps, he hoped, it was only\nannoyance.\n\n_But what could I do?_ he asked himself. _Let Meyers spill it?_\n\nIn the end, with Taranto answering in monosyllables and Meyers\nintimidated into an unnatural reserve, the Syssokans retired. The\ndarkness closed in upon the Terrans as they listened to the creaking of\nthe ladder below the trap door.\n\n\"Give them time,\" advised Taranto, hearing Meyers move toward the exit.\n\nThey waited in the silent dark until Meyers could stand it no longer.\n\n\"They won't come back,\" he whispered.\n\n\"Well, make sure,\" said Taranto shortly. \"Get your ear to the wood!\"\n\nHe felt his way to the window that faced away from the city. After the\nheat of the day, the air blowing in was almost cold; and he considered\nputting on his shirt. The realization that he would have to scrabble\naround the pile of straw for it gave him pause. His next thought was\nthat he might come up with the wrong shirt, and that discouraged him\ncompletely.\n\nHis eyes had adjusted enough to the night to pick out the low hills of\nthe desert where they broke the line of the horizon. Starlight glinted\nsoftly where there were stretches of sand. He settled down to wait, his\narms folded upon the ledge of the window.\n\nIt was nearly half an hour later, when he suspected Meyers of dozing\non the trap door, that Taranto heard something more than an insect zip\npast the window. He backed away and hissed to attract Meyers' attention.\n\n\"Did it come?\" whispered the other.\n\n\"I think so,\" answered Taranto.\n\nA tiny hum drifted through the window. Into the opening, timidly, edged\na small, hovering shape.\n\n\"Okay,\" said Taranto in a low voice, even though he knew the room was\nbeing scanned by an infra-red detector.\n\nThe shape blossomed out with a midget light. Enough of the glow was\nreflected from the adobe walls to reveal that a miniature flying\nmechanism the size of a man's hand had landed on the window ledge.\nAfter a moment, its rotors ceased their whirring. Taranto jabbed\nbackward with an elbow as he heard Meyers creep up behind him.\n\n\"Listen at the door, dammit!\" he snarled. \"All we need is to get caught\nat this, an' we'll be here till they turn out the sun!\"\n\n\"Taranto!\" piped a tiny voice from the machine. \"Are you ready,\nTaranto?\"\n\n\"Go ahead!\"\n\n\"Two pills coming out of the hold.\" The voice was clear enough in the\nstillness of the Syssokan night.\n\nA hatch in the belly of the little flyer slid back. Two capsules\nspilled out on the window ledge. Taranto scooped them up.\n\n\"You each take one, with water,\" instructed the voice. \"Better wait\ntill just before dawn. You told me they bring your food an hour later.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" whispered Taranto.\n\n\"That will give the stuff time to act. For all they can tell, you will\nboth be deader than a burned-out meteorite.\"\n\n\"Then what?\"\n\n\"So they will follow their normal custom with the dead--take you out\nto the desert to mummify. This thing will hover overhead to spot the\nlocation.\"\n\n\"Do they just ... leave us?\"\n\n\"Yes, as far as anybody has ever been able to find out. I talked to the\nCapellan next door in the foreign quarter here, and he says they might\nnot leave you in one of their own burial grounds. Otherwise, I would\nhate to take the chance of having this gadget seen in the daylight.\"\n\n\"All right, so we're out in the desert,\" said Taranto. \"How does this\nship you arranged for pick us up? We'll still be out for the count.\"\n\n\"I plan to tell them where to touch down. I can talk louder by radio,\nyou know, than I can to you now. They will grab your 'bodies' and\nscramble for space. Against the sunset, they may not even be seen from\nthe city. If they are, I never heard of them.\"\n\n\"Who are they?\" asked Taranto.\n\n\"Some bunch hired for the job by the D.I.R.'s Department 99. Just as\nwell not to ask where they come from or what their usual line is.\"\n\n\"I ain't got any questions at all, if they get us out of here,\" said\nTaranto.\n\nHe watched as the hatch closed itself and the tiny light blinked out.\nThe rotors began to spin, and two minutes later they were alone.\n\n\"Come and get yours,\" said the spacer.\n\nHe reached out with his empty hand to guide Meyers to him, then very\ncarefully delivered one of the capsules to the other.\n\n\"We're supposed to swallow that big lump?\" whispered Meyers.\n\n\"Just don't lose it,\" admonished Taranto.\n\nHe relayed the instructions as precisely as he could.\n\n\"One thing more,\" he concluded. \"You stay awake to make sure I stay\nawake until it's time to take the stuff.\"\n\n\"We could take watches,\" suggested Meyers.\n\n\"_I_ could,\" said Taranto bluntly, \"but I'm not sure about you. In the\nsecond place, I ain't going to have you sleep while I don't. We're\ngoing to play this as safe as possible.\"\n\nMeyers grumbled something inaudibly. In the darkness, a sardonic smile\ntwisted Taranto's lips.\n\n\"If you know how,\" he advised, \"pray! We're goin' to our funeral in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\n\n\nFOUR\n\n\nWestervelt sat at his little desk in the corner, doodling out possible\nways and means of breaking out of a cell thirty fathoms or so under\nwater. From time to time Beryl or Simonetta offered a suggestion. He\nknew that everyone in the office was probably engaged in the same\npuzzle. Smith believed in general brain-storming in getting a project\nstarted, since no one could tell where a good idea might not originate.\n\n\"If I ever get into space,\" Willie muttered, \"it will never be to a\nplanet as wet as Trident. What ever made this Harris think he was a\npearl diver?\"\n\n\"Is that what he was after?\" asked Beryl.\n\n\"No, I just made that up.\"\n\nHe glanced over at Simonetta, who winked and continued with the letter\nshe was transcribing. An earphone reproduced Smith's dictation from\nhis tape. As she listened, she edited mentally and spoke into the\nmicrophone of her typing machine, which transcribed her words as type.\nWestervelt realized that it was more difficult than it seemed to do\nthe job so smoothly. He had noticed Beryl rewriting letters two or\nthree times, and Parrish was more likely than the boss to set down his\nthoughts in a logical order.\n\n\"I've heard so many wild ideas in this office,\" said Beryl, \"that I\nsimply don't know where to start. How do they decide on a good way?\"\n\n\"They guess, just the way we've been doing. They're better guessers\nthan we are, from experience.\"\n\n\"It's just a matter of judgment, I suppose,\" Beryl admitted.\n\n\"They make their share of mistakes,\" Simonetta put in.\n\n\"Yeah, I read an old report on a great one,\" said Westervelt. \"Ever\nhear of the time they were shipping oxygen tanks to three spacers\njailed out around Mizar?\"\n\nSimonetta stopped talking her letter, and the girls gave Willie their\nattention.\n\n\"It seems,\" he continued, \"that an exploring ship landed on a planet of\nthat star and found a kind of civilization they hadn't bargained for.\nThe natives breathed air with a high chlorine content; so when they\ngrabbed three of the crew for hostages, the ship had to keep supplying\nfresh tanks of oxygen.\"\n\n\"How long could they keep that up?\" asked Beryl.\n\n\"Not indefinitely, anyway. They weren't recovering any carbon dioxide\nfor processing, the way they would in the ship. The captain figured\nhe'd better lift and orbit while he tried to negotiate. Meanwhile, he\nsent to the Department for help, and they came up with a poor guess.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"They got the captain to disguise some spacesuit rockets as oxygen\ntanks and send them down by the auxiliary rocket they were using to\nmake deliveries and keep contact. The idea was that the prisoners would\nfly themselves over the walls like angels, the rocket would snatch them\nup, and they'd all filter the green-white light of Mizar from their\nlenses forever.\"\n\n\"And why didn't it work?\"\n\n\"Oh, it worked,\" said Westervelt. \"It worked beautifully. The only\ntrouble was that when they got these three guys aboard and were picking\nup stellar speed, they found that the Mizarians had pulled a little\nsleight of hand. They'd stuck three of their own into the Terran\nspacesuits--pretty cramped, but able to move--and sent them to spy out\nthe ship. Well, the captain took one look and realized it was all over.\nHe couldn't supply the Mizarians with enough chlorine to keep them\nalive until they could be sent back. He just kept going.\"\n\n\"But the men they left behind!\" exclaimed Beryl. \"What happened to\nthem?\"\n\nWestervelt shrugged.\n\n\"They never exactly found out.\"\n\nBeryl, horrified, turned to Simonetta, who stared reflectively at the\nwall.\n\n\"For all we know,\" said the dark girl, \"they were dead already.\"\n\n\"It was about even,\" said Westervelt. \"The Mizarians never heard\nexactly what happened to theirs either.\"\n\nThere was a period of silence while they considered that angle.\nSimonetta finally said, \"Why don't you tell her about the time they\ngave that spacer the hormone treatment for a disguise?\"\n\n\"Oh ... you tell it,\" said Westervelt, trapped. \"You know it better\nthan I do.\"\n\n\"That one,\" began Simonetta, \"happened on a world where there's a\ncolony from Terra that isn't much talked about. It's a sort of Amazon\nculture, and they don't allow men. They were set to execute this fellow\nwho smuggled himself in for a lark, when the Department started\nshipping him drugs that changed his appearance.\"\n\nWestervelt admired Beryl's wide-eyed intentness.\n\n\"Finally,\" Simonetta continued, \"his appearance changed so much that\nhe could dress up and pass for a woman anywhere. He just walked out\nwhen the next scheduled spaceship landed, and was halfway back to Terra\nbefore they finished searching the woods for him. It made trouble,\nthough.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" breathed Beryl.\n\n\"They never quite succeeded in changing him back. His wife wound up\ndivorcing him for infidelity when he gave birth to twins.\"\n\nBeryl straightened up abruptly.\n\n\"Oh...! You--come on, now!\"\n\nWestervelt reminded himself that the blush must have resulted less\nfrom the joke than from having been taken in. They were still laughing\nwhen a buzzer sounded at Beryl's desk phone. She flipped the switch,\nlistened for a moment, then rose with a toss of her blonde head at\nWestervelt.\n\n\"Mr. Parrish wants me to help him research in the dead files,\" she\nsaid. \"I bet _he_ won't try that kind of gag on me!\"\n\n\"No,\" muttered Westervelt as she strode out, \"he has some all his own.\"\n\nHe looked up to find Simonetta watching him with a grin. She shook her\nhead ruefully as Westervelt grew a flush to match Beryl's.\n\n\"Willie, Willie!\" she said sadly. \"You aren't letting that bottle\nblonde bother you? I didn't think you were that kind of boy!\"\n\nWestervelt grinned back, at some cost.\n\n\"Is there another kind?\" he asked. \"After, all, Si, she's only been\naround a few weeks. It's the novelty. I'll get used to her.\"\n\n\"_Sure_ you will,\" said Simonetta.\n\nShe returned to her letters, and Westervelt hunched over his desk\nto brood. He wondered what Parrish and Beryl were up to in the file\nroom. He could think of no innocent reason to wander in on business of\nhis own. Perhaps, he reflected, he did not really want to; he might\noverhear something he would regret.\n\nHe passed some time without directing a single thought to the problems\nof the Department. Then the door beyond Simonetta opened and Smith\nstrolled out. He carried a pad as if he, too, had been doodling.\n\n\"Well, Willie,\" he said cheerfully, \"what are we going to do about this\nHarris fellow?\"\n\n\"All I can think of, Mr. Smith, is to offer to trade them a few people\nwe could do without,\" said Westervelt.\n\nSmith grinned. He seemed to be willing to make up a little list.\n\n\"Some who never would be missed, eh? And let's head the page with\npeople who take messages from thinking fish!\"\n\nHe pottered about for a few moments before winding up seated on a\ncorner of the unoccupied secretarial desk.\n\n\"I was actually thinking of skin divers,\" he confided. \"Then I realized\nthat if it takes a twenty foot monster to wander the undersea wilds of\nTrident without being intimidated, maybe those waters wouldn't be too\nsafe for Terran swimmers.\"\n\n\"Unless they could get one of the monsters for a guide,\" suggested\nWestervelt.\n\nThe three of them pondered that possibility.\n\n\"I can see it now,\" said Simonetta. \"My name Swishy. Me good guide. You\nwant find pearl? Not allowed here; we no steal from other fish!\"\n\nThey laughed, and Smith demanded to know how one _thought_ in pidgin\ntalk. They discussed the probability of fraud in the reports that Smith\nhad received, and concluded reluctantly that, whether or not some trick\nmight be involved, there was bound to be some truth in the story.\n\n\"I suppose we'll have to use this fishy network to locate him,\" sighed\nSmith at last. \"It would take too long to ship out parts of a small sub\nto be assembled on Trident. The whole thing makes me wonder if I'll\never eat another seafood dinner!\"\n\n\"Maybe somebody else will think of something,\" said Westervelt, partly\nto conceal the fact that he himself had come up with nothing.\n\n\"Tell you what,\" said Smith, nodding. \"Suppose you go along and see how\nBob Lydman is making out, while I sign these letters. You might check\nat the com room sometime, too, in case anything else on the case comes\nin.\"\n\nWestervelt agreed, made sure he had something in his pocket to write\nupon should the need arise, and left.\n\nA few minutes later, he reached the end of the corridor, having cocked\nan ear at the door of the old file office as he passed and heard Beryl\ngiggling at some remark by Parrish. He unclenched his teeth and knocked\non Lydman's door.\n\nHe waited a minute and tried again, but there was still no answer.\n\nHe hesitated, wondering what would happen should he walk in and find\nthat Lydman was physically present but not in a mood to recognize any\none else's existence. Slowly, he walked back to the washroom on the\nopposite side of the hall.\n\nWashing his hands with deliberation, Westervelt decided that it might\nbe best to get Lydman on the phone. He could not, in fact, understand\nwhy inside phone calls were not more popular in the office. He supposed\nthat the face-to-face habit had grown up among the staff, probably\nreflecting Smith's preference for getting everyone personally involved\nin everything. There might even be a deeper cause--they were so often\nin contact with distant places by the tenuous beaming of interstellar\nsignals that there must be a certain reassurance and sense of security\nin having within physical reach the person to whom one was speaking.\n\n\"I'll have to watch for that if I stay here long enough,\" Westervelt\ntold himself. \"You don't have to be a prizefighter to get punchy, I\nguess.\"\n\nHe examined himself critically in the mirror over the sink, thinking\nthat he could do with a neater appearance. A coin in the slot of a\ndispenser on the wall bought him a disposable paper comb with which he\nsmoothed down his dark hair.\n\n_I need a haircut almost as bad as Castor P._ he thought. _I wonder if\nthat really stands for Pollux? What a thing for parents to do! On the\nother hand, from people that came up with one like him, you'd expect\nalmost anything!_\n\nNo one came in while he was in the washroom, much as he would have\nwelcomed an excuse for conversation. He dawdled his way through the\ndoor into the corridor, not liking the thought of inflicting his\npresence upon Beryl and Parrish. That meant he would have to walk back\nas far as the spare conference room to find a phone.\n\n\"Of course, there's the lab,\" he muttered.\n\nThat was only a few steps away, and he could hardly do much damage\nbetween the door and the phone.\n\nReaching the end of the corridor once more, he decided to make one last\ntry at Lydman's door. Again, there was no reply to his knock, so he\nturned away to the laboratory door and entered.\n\nHe was faced by a vista of tables, workbenches with power tools, and\ndiverse assemblies of testing apparatus, most of the latter dusty and\npresenting the appearance of gold-bergs knocked together for temporary\nuse and then shoved aside until someone might need a part from one\nof them. By far the greater space, however, was occupied by shelves\nand crates and stacks of small cartons or loosely wrapped packages\nin which various gadgets seemed to be stored after plans of them had\nbeen transmitted to the field. Half a dozen large files for drawings\nand blueprints reached nearly to the ceiling. Racks of instruments in\nrelatively recent use or consideration stood here and there among the\ntables and workbenches.\n\nTo Westervelt's right, near the far wall behind which lay the\ncommunications room, he caught sight of a prowling figure. He\nrecognized Lydman's broad shoulders and hesitated.\n\nThe ex-spacer had paused to examine a gadget lying on one of the\ntables. From Westervelt's position, it appeared to be a wristwatch or\nsomething similar. Lydman picked it up and turned toward a part of\nthe wall where a thick steel plate had been fastened to an insulated\npartition of brick. He raised the \"watch\" to eye level, as if aiming.\n\nA thin pencil of white flame leaped from the instrument to spatter\nsparks against the already scarred and stained steel. Sucked up by\nthe air-conditioning, the small puff of smoke disappeared so quickly\nthat Westervelt realized that the scorched odor was entirely in his\nimagination.\n\nLydman replaced the instrument casually before strolling over to\nanother table. He inspected an open pack of cigarettes with a grim\nsmile, but let them lie there in plain sight. Westervelt reminded\nhimself never to grub one of those, just on general principles. Lydman\nwent on to a small cylinder somewhat larger than an old-fashioned\nbattery flashlight. Something clicked under his finger, and from one\nend of the cylinder emerged the folding blades of a portable fan. The\nex-spacer pressed a second switch position to start them spinning. He\nturned the fan to blow across his face, as if to check its cooling\npower, then held the thing at arm's length as he thumbed the switch to\na third position.\n\nA low, humming sound reached Westervelt. It rose rapidly in pitch until\nit passed beyond his hearing range. He shook his head slightly. For\nsome reason, he found it difficult to concentrate. Perhaps Lydman's\npresence, unexpected as it was, had upset him, he thought. He decided\nthat he must be getting a dizzy spell of some sort. Then he became\nconcerned lest he turn nauseous.\n\nThe final stage, hardly a minute after Lydman had last moved the\nswitch, found Westervelt tensing as a wave of sheer panic swept over\nhim.\n\nHe stepped back toward the door, noticing dizzily that Lydman wore a\nstrange expression too. Part of the youth's mind wondered if some of\nthe ultra-sonic effect were reflected from the walls to the ex-spacer;\nanother part insisted upon leaving the scene as hastily as possible.\n\nHe got himself into the corridor again, actually panting as he eased\nthe door closed behind him. He started to walk, finding his knees\na trifle loose. Passing the washroom, he hesitated; but he decided\nthat he could make it to the conference room. Once there, however, he\nslipped inside and sat down to recover.\n\n\"What does it take to have a mind like that?\" he whispered to, himself.\n\"It's like a hobby to him. I think some day I ought to look for a job\nwith reasonably normal people!\"\n\nA few minutes of peace and quiet refreshed him. He returned to the main\noffice, just as Smith was surrendering a stack of signed letters to\nSimonetta Diorio. They looked around as he entered.\n\n\"Well, Willie, did he have anything going?\" asked Smith.\n\n\"I ... uh ... he was kind of busy,\" said Westervelt.\n\n\"What did he seem to have in mind?\" Smith started to reach for\nSimonetta's phone switch.\n\n\"He ... that is ... I didn't ask him. He was ... busy, in the lab.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Smith.\n\nHe peered at Westervelt's expression, and added, \"Then ... perhaps we'd\nbetter not disturb him. It might spoil any ideas he's putting together.\"\n\nWestervelt managed a grunt of assent as he turned to walk back to his\ndesk.\n\n_Whatever he's putting together_, he thought, _I'd rather stay out of\nthe way._\n\nHe hunched over his desk, staring unseeingly at the notes he had\nscribbled earlier. He was vaguely conscious of the cessation of talk in\nthe background, but he did not notice Simonetta's approach until the\ngirl stood beside him.\n\n\"What happened, Willie?\" she asked. \"You look as if he threw you out.\"\n\n\"No. Not deliberately, anyhow,\" said Westervelt. \"At least, I don't\n_think_ he knew I was even there--although how can you tell if he\ndoesn't want to let on?\"\n\nHe told her what had happened in the laboratory. She nodded\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"I suppose it has its uses,\" said Westervelt. \"I hate to think of the\nway he plays around with things in there. Wasn't there a time when\nsomeone killed himself in that lab?\"\n\n\"That was years ago,\" said Simonetta.\n\nShe hugged herself as if feeling a sudden chill, her large, soft eyes\nserious. Westervelt realized that she was actually a very beautiful\ngirl, much more so than Beryl, and he wondered why he felt so\ndifferently about them. Simonetta seemed too nice to fit the ideas he\ngot concerning Beryl. Something told him that his thinking was mixed up.\n\n_I guess you just grow out of that_, he reflected silently. _Maybe\nthey're the same under the skin._\n\n\n\n\nFIVE\n\n\nWhen Beryl walked in, Westervelt was at one of the tall windows with\nSimonetta, dialing filter combinations to make the most of the setting\nsun. They had the edge of it showing as a deep crimson ball beside\nanother building in the vicinity.\n\n\"What are you two doping out?\" asked the blonde. \"Some disappearing\ntrick?\"\n\nSimonetta laughed as Westervelt shoved the dial setting to afternoon\nnormal.\n\n\"It's an idea,\" he said, scowling at Beryl.\n\n\"For underwater?\" she demanded mockingly.\n\n\"Ever hear of a squid?\" retorted Westervelt. \"_They_ hide themselves\nunderwater. Maybe a cloud of dye would be as good as a filter.\"\n\n\"Willie, that _is_ an idea!\" said Simonetta. \"You ought to tell Mr.\nSmith.\"\n\nWestervelt looked at her sourly. Now Beryl knew that they really had\nbeen wasting time, and had a point to score against him in their next\nexchange.\n\n_Oh, well. I can't hold a thing like that against Si_, he thought. _I\ncan think of people who'd be on the way to Smitty already, calling it\ntheir own idea._\n\nBeryl had done a ladylike collapse into her chair and crossed her legs.\nShe dug into her purse for cigarettes and requested a light.\n\n\"Why don't you buy a brand with a lighter in the box?\" asked Westervelt.\n\nNevertheless, he walked over to the switchboard cubicle for the office\ndesk lighter that had been appropriated by Pauline. Returning with it\nafter a moment, he lit Beryl's cigarette and inquired, \"Well, what did\nyou and Parrish dig up?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she sighed, leaning back, \"but, boy, did we dig!\"\n\n\"Yeah, I thought I heard the shovel clink once,\" said Westervelt,\nthinking of the laughter he had heard through the door of the dead file\noffice.\n\nBeryl, concerned with her own complaints, ignored him.\n\n\"We must have looked up thirty or forty cases,\" she went on. \"I never\neven heard of most of those places on the newscasts!\"\n\n\"Did he find anything that gave him an idea?\" asked Simonetta.\n\n\"Not a thing! There seemed to be some real crazy spots in the records,\nbut nobody ever got in jail at the bottom of an ocean.\"\n\n\"You'd think it would have happened sometime,\" said Simonetta\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"I suppose,\" suggested Westervelt, \"that on any planet where Terrans\nwere taken underwater, they didn't live long enough to be one of our\ncases. On a place like Trident, they usually wouldn't have any trouble.\nThey'd stay on land, and any local life would stay in the sea. It took\na nut like Harris to go poking around where he wasn't wanted.\"\n\n\"That's what Mr. Parrish hinted,\" said Beryl. \"All I know is that it\nsounds like a story out of a laughing academy. They shouldn't allow\nthem to get into places like that.\"\n\n\"Then we'd all be looking for work,\" said Westervelt. \"Don't complain,\nBeryl--maybe it will happen to you someday.\"\n\nThe blonde shivered and turned to face her desk.\n\n\"Not me,\" she declared. \"I'm staying on Terra, even if they do offer me\na field trip as a sort of vacation.\"\n\n_Ah, he's already started that line on her, thought Westervelt. I\nwonder if there's anything in the files on how to spring a secretary\nfrom a penthouse?_\n\nLydman and Parrish walked in, the latter pausing to exchange remarks\nwith Pauline, the switchboard operator. A moment later, Smith opened\nhis door as if expecting someone. He must have phoned them for a\nchange, Westervelt realized.\n\n\"Oh, there you are, Willie,\" said the chief. \"I suppose you might as\nwell sit in on this too. We might need something, and meanwhile, you\ncan be picking up a tip or two.\"\n\nWestervelt rose and followed the others into Smith's office, where he\ntook a chair by the window. The others clustered around the chief's\ndesk, a vast plateau of silvery plastic strewn with a hodge-podge of\npapers and tapes.\n\nThe office itself was like a small museum. The walls were lined with\nphotographs, mostly of poor quality but showing \"interesting\" devices\nthat had been used in various department cases. The ones in which the\ncolor was better usually showed Smith in company with two or three\nmen wearing space uniforms and self-conscious looks. Sometimes, a more\nassured individual was shown in the act of presenting some sort of\nmemento or letter of appreciation to Smith. Lydman and Parrish also\nappeared in several of the pictures.\n\n_The record of our best cases_, thought Westervelt. _The bad ones are\nburied in the files._\n\nStanding along the walls, or on little tables and bases of their\nown, were a good many models of spaceships, planetary systems, and\nnon-humanoid beings. A few of the latter statues were enough to have\nmade Beryl declare she was perfectly happy to stay out of Smith's\noffice and be someone else's secretary. One model, which Westervelt\nsecretly longed to examine at leisure, showed an entire city with its\nsurrounding landscape on a distant planet.\n\nWestervelt tore his attention from the mementoes and turned toward the\ngroup as Smith settled himself behind the desk.\n\n\"This is no longer even approximately funny,\" said the department head.\n\"I've had a few calls put through. Do you know how little we're going\nto have to work with?\"\n\n\"I gather that it is not very much,\" said Parrish calmly.\n\n\"There are less than fifty Terrans on that whole planet!\" declared\nSmith, running the fingers of one hand through his already untidy hair.\n\"The nearest colony or friendly spaceport from which we could have\nequipment sent in is twenty odd lightyears away.\"\n\n\"Well, that could be done,\" said Lydman mildly.\n\n\"Oh, of course, it could be done,\" admitted Smith. \"But how long do\nwe have to fool around? We don't know under what conditions Harris is\nbeing held.\"\n\nParrish leaned forward to rest his elbows on Smith's desk.\n\n\"We can deduce some of them pretty well,\" he suggested. \"In the first\nplace, if he got out several messages--which we'll have to assume he\ndid--they must have found some means of providing him with air.\"\n\n\"He could have lived a while on the air in this submarine he built,\"\nsaid Lydman.\n\n\"Yes, but in that case, he would have used its radio for communication.\nWe have to assume that they pried him out somehow, no?\"\n\nThe others nodded.\n\n\"He wouldn't last too long in a spacesuit, even if they pumped in air\nunder pressure,\" said Lydman judiciously.\n\n\"So they must have built some kind of structure to house him, if only a\nbig tank,\" said Parrish.\n\nWestervelt stirred, then closed his mouth rather than interrupt.\nSmith, however, had seen the motion and looked up.\n\n\"Speak up, Willie,\" he invited. \"It won't sound any sillier than\nanything else that's been said in this room.\"\n\n\"I ... I was wondering about these Tridentians,\" said Westervelt.\n\"Does anybody know how they live? Do they have cities built on the sea\nbottom?\"\n\n\"If they have water jet vehicles, they certainly have the technical--\"\n\nSmith stopped as he saw Parrish lean back and roll his eyes toward the\nceiling.\n\n\"What now, Pete?\" he demanded apprehensively.\n\n\"I don't know why that didn't occur to me sooner,\" groaned Parrish. \"A\nhundred to one they have a nomadic set-up. It would be typical, with an\nenvironment like that. This is worse than we thought.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" muttered Smith after a few moments of silence, \"how can we\nget a direction fix on a thought?\"\n\n\"Something like that,\" said Parrish. \"I suppose they have bases, where\nthey keep permanent manufacturing facilities. Probably set up at points\nwhere they have access to minerals--unless they know how to extract\nwhat they need from the water itself.\"\n\n\"Nothing hard about that,\" agreed Smith. \"I'll have to send out a few\nmore questions. Of course, they'll take the attitude that I should be\ndoing something instead of asking about irrelevant subjects....\"\n\n\"We're used to that,\" smiled Parrish, showing his beautiful teeth.\n\nWestervelt wondered how broadly he would smile if it were his own\nresponsibility. He had an idea that Parrish might be rather less than\nhalf as charming if he were running the operation and not getting much\nhelp from the others in solving the problem. He had to admit, however,\nthat the man had a knack for spotting alien culture patterns. When he\nhad asked his question about the cities, it was merely because he had\nhalf-pictured some Terran-style dome underwater and knew that that\nimage was unlikely.\n\n\"Anyway,\" Parrish was going on, \"we should probably think of them as\nbeing free as birds to go where they like. Even before they developed\nmachines, they probably migrated about their world by swimming. I\ngather that these other ... fish, I suppose we'll have to call them....\"\n\n\"Thinking fish!\" murmured Smith sadly. He ran his hand through his hair\nagain.\n\n\"I suppose those things still do, besides other types we still haven't\nheard of, which would fill the place of Terran animals. So, then--we'll\nhave to look for temporary locations and think in terms of a fast raid\nrather than a careful penetration.\"\n\n\"If we could find them, there must be some way we could armor a few\nspacesuits against pressure and drop down on them,\" said Lydman. \"I\nthink I can dig up a weapon or two that will work underwater in a way\nthese clams never thought of.\"\n\n\"Maybe we could do better to have Swishy the thinking fish hypnotize\nthem into bringing Harris back,\" said Westervelt.\n\nThey looked at him thoughtfully, and he was horrified to see his joke\nbeing taken seriously. He squirmed in his chair by the window, wishing\nhe had kept his mouth shut.\n\n\"I wonder ...\" mused Smith. \"If they can actually exchange thoughts....\"\n\n\"They might have natural defenses,\" said Parrish tentatively.\n\n\"What could we bribe a fish with?\" asked Lydman, but hopefully rather\nthan derisively.\n\nSmith made another note, then drummed his fingers on his desk top. The\nfour of them sat in silence. Westervelt hoped that the others were\nengaged in more productive thoughts than his own. It was nice to have\ntheir attention, and get the reputation of a bright young man who came\nup with suggestions; but when they decided upon some reasonable course\nof action they might remember him for making a foolish remark.\n\n\"Willie,\" said Smith, coming to a decision, \"circulate around and ask\nthe others if they can stick it out a couple of hours tonight. Maybe\nthere's time to pry some useful information out of Trident, and at\nleast get something started before we close down. If I know some guy\nout in space is working on it, I can sleep anyway.\"\n\nWestervelt left his place by the window and went into the outer office.\nHe told Simonetta and Beryl. The latter acted less than thrilled.\nWestervelt wondered jealously what kind of date she had scheduled for\nthe evening. He stopped at the window of the switchboard cubbyhole.\n\n\"Oh, it's you, Willie!\" exclaimed Pauline.\n\n\"Yeah, you can turn on the projector again,\" he grinned. \"What is it, a\nlove movie?\"\n\nPauline edged a small tape projector out from behind the side of her\nboard.\n\n\"It's homework, if you have to know,\" she told him.\n\n\"That's right, you still go to college,\" Westervelt recalled. \"Why\ndon't you switch to alien psychology? Then you could qualify for office\nmanager around here.\"\n\n\"When do we have alien visitors here? Once in a ringed moon!\"\n\n\"Who is to say which are the aliens?\" said Westervelt. \"There are days\nwhen I think I could feel more understanding to something with twelve\ntentacles and a tank of chlorine than to a lot of the mentalities that\nget loose right in this office. There's a crash program on for the\nevening, by the way, and Smitty wants the staff to hang on a while.\"\n\nA look of dismay flashed over Pauline's youthful features.\n\n\"I know; you have a class tonight,\" Westervelt deduced. \"Chuck it all.\nStay in the file room with Mr. Parrish and you'll learn twice as much.\"\n\nPauline offered to throw the projector at him, but laughed. Westervelt\ntold her that no one would miss her if she connected a few of the main\noffice phones to outside lines and hooked up the communications room\nwith Smith's desk.\n\nHe left her wondering if she ought to stay anyhow, and headed for the\nhall. Halfway along to the communications room, he heard the elevator\ndoors open and close. He stopped and looked back.\n\nAround the corner strolled one of the TV men, Joe Rosenkrantz.\nWestervelt looked at his watch and realized that it was a shift change\nfor the communications personnel, who kept touch with the universe\ntwenty-four hours a day.\n\n_In case someone somewhere makes a dumb mistake like Harris_,\nthought Westervelt. _They overdo it a little, I think. I suppose\nit's the typical pride and joy of Terran technical culture to signal\nhalfway across the galaxy to fix something that might have been\ncured beforehand when Harris was a little boy. I wonder what the\npsychologists should have done about me to keep me out of a place like\nthis?_\n\n\"Hello, Willie,\" said Rosenkrantz, catching up. \"Going to the com room?\"\n\nWestervelt admitted as much, and gave the operator a brief outline of\nthe afternoon's developments. Rosenkrantz remained unperturbed.\n\n\"Hope they don't get intoxicated with ingenuity, and insist on sending\nmessages all over,\" he grunted. \"I was looking forward to a quiet night\nshift.\"\n\nThey went in to tell Colborn, who took it well. He pointed out to\nWestervelt that he would in no case have been concerned with the\novertime operation. When he was relieved, he was relieved--period.\n\n\"I forget this crazy place the minute the elevator door closes behind\nme,\" he said grinning, having handed over to Rosenkrantz his log and a\nfew unofficial comments about traffic he had heard during recent hours.\n\"There are some who wait till they hit the street, but I believe in\na clean cut. I walk in, push 'Main Floor,' and everything else goes\nblank.\"\n\nHe went out the door, refusing to dignify their jeers by any defense,\nand made for the elevators. By the time he reached the corner of the\nhall, he had slipped into his topcoat. He pushed the button to call the\nelevator.\n\nWhen it arrived, Colborn stepped inside and rode down to the\nninety-fifth floor. He switched to a public express elevator, which\npicked up several other people before becoming an express at the\nseventy-fifth floor.\n\n\"Lived through it again,\" he muttered to a man next to him as they\nreached the main floor.\n\nHe joined the growing stream of office workers flowing through the\nlobby of the building, taking for granted the kaleidoscopic play of\ndecorative lights on the translucent ceiling. He noticed them when they\nsuddenly went out.\n\nThere was first silence, then a babble of voices until small emergency\nlights went on. Someone spoke of a fuse blowing. Colborn looked\noutside, and saw no street lights or illuminated signs. His first\nthought was power for his set upstairs.\n\n\"No, that's special,\" he told himself, \"but I'd better call and see if\nthe elevators are working.\"\n\n\n\n\nSIX\n\n\nFor a jail cell, the chamber was quite commodious. The walls were\nof bare stone, like most of the buildings on Greenhaven which Maria\nRingstad had visited during her short period of sightseeing. She\nthought that it must have entailed a great deal of extra labor to\nprovide such large rooms in a stone building, especially when the\nmaterials had to be quarried by relatively primitive means.\n\nOn Greenhaven, everything had evidently been done the hard way. She\nhad heard about that facet of the Greenie character before leaving the\nship, and she now wished that she had listened more carefully. It was\ndifficult to picture in her mind just how far away that spaceship was\nby this time.\n\nThat had been the worst, the feeling of having been abandoned.\n\nMeanwhile, having turned up her nose at the sewing chores they had\nassigned to her but having nothing else to occupy her, she sat on the\nedge of the austere wooden shelf that doubled as a bed and a bench. The\nGreenie guard standing in the doorway looked as if he had expected to\nfind the sewing done.\n\n\"Can't you understand, honey?\" said Maria lightly. \"You can cart that\nbasket of rags away. I have no intention of sticking my fingers with\nthose crude needles you people use.\"\n\nThe Greenie was a short, sturdy young man, uniformed in the drabbest of\ndun-colored clothing. A shirt with a high, tight collar starched like\ncardboard held his chin at a dignified elevation. It also seemed to\nkeep his eyes wide open, Maria thought, unless that was his naturally\nnaive expression.\n\n\"Did anyone ever tell you those hats would make good spittoons?\" she\nasked.\n\n\"It is forbidden to speak vainly of any correction official,\" said the\nyoung man stiffly.\n\n\"Correction official!\" echoed Maria. \"Look, honey, don't kid with me! I\nbet you're just a janitor here. If I thought you were a real official,\nwho might be cuddled into letting me out of this cage, I'd be a lot\nmore friendly.\"\n\nShe gave him an amiable grin. It was not returned.\n\nThe Greenie stood gripping the thick edge of the blank wooden door\nuntil his knuckles whitened. He looked like a man who had just\ndiscovered a worm in his apple. Half a worm, in fact.\n\n\"Now, I may be pushing thirty-five,\" said Maria, \"but I _know_ I don't\nlook _that_ bad. Actually, alongside your Greenie girls, I stack up\npretty well, don't you think? For one thing, I'm shorter than you are.\nFor another, I fill out my clothes and don't look like a skinny old\nhorse.\"\n\n\"You ... you ... are not ... dressed as an honest woman,\" the guard got\nout.\n\nSitting on the edge of the wooden bunk, Maria crossed her knees--and\nthought he would choke. She tugged slightly at the short skirt that had\nattracted so many lowering stares when she had strolled down the main\nstreet of First Haven. She was used to being among men, but this poor\nsoul was outside her experience.\n\nMaria Ringstad was aware of both her visual shortcomings and\nattractions. After a month here, her hair was beginning to grow in\ndarker and less auburn. She was a trifle solid for her five-feet-four,\nbut that came of having a durable frame. Her face was squarish, with\na determined nose, and her hazel eyes looked green in some lights. On\nthe other hand, she had a nice smile, and she had spent much time in\nplaces where few women went. She was used to being popular with the\nopposite sex, even in face of competition from members of her own. In\nthe Greenie women, with their voluminous, drab dresses and hangdog\nexpressions devoid of the least make-up, she saw little competition.\n\n\"Really,\" she said, \"no one else would think of me as a criminal. I\njust tried to buy a picture in that little shop. Then the heavens fell\nin on me.\"\n\n\"The heavens do not fall on Greenhaven,\" said the guard firmly.\n\n\"Well, anyway, some very sour characters trumped up all sorts of\ncharges against me, and here I am. But I didn't _do_ anything!\"\n\n\"The attempt is equal to the deed!\"\n\nMaria shook her head and sighed. She stood up and took a few steps\ntoward him.\n\n\"You must keep your place,\" ordered the young man, with an undercurrent\nof panic in his tone. \"I have not come to debate justice with you. You\nhave sinned and you have been sentenced.\"\n\n_I bet he'd faint if I threw my arms around him_, thought Maria.\n\n\"But what was the sin, honey?\" she demanded. \"You'd think I'd written a\nbad article about Greenhaven for my syndicate. Honestly, I didn't even\nhave time to see the place.\"\n\nThe young man released the edge of the door, but still looked worried.\n\n\"Greenhaven was founded by colonists who sought liberty and were\nwilling to create a haven for it by the sweat of their brows,\" he\ninformed her. \"Conditions were inhospitable. There were plagues to test\ntheir faith and ungainly beasts to test their courage. What has been\nbuilt here has been built by a great communal struggle, and it is not\nto be hazarded by the sinful attitudes of old Terra, and--you should\nhave paid the listed price.\"\n\n\"But he wouldn't sell me one at that price when I offered it!\"\n\n\"Then he did not have one. You attempted to bribe him.\"\n\n\"Well, it was just a friendly offer,\" said Maria, straightening her\nskirt. \"It didn't amount to anything.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it amounted to bribery, immorality, and economic\nsubversion. Procedures such as purchase and merchandising must be\nstrictly regulated for the good of the community. We cannot permit\nchaos to intrude upon the peace of Greenhaven.\"\n\n\"You know, honey,\" she remarked, studying him with her head cocked to\none side, \"you talk like a book. A very old book.\"\n\nThe guard rolled his eyes toward the hall. He relaxed for the first\ntime, in order to lean back and listen to something in the corridor.\n\n\"I must caution you to cease addressing me as 'honey,'\" he said in a\nlower voice. \"I hear the steps of my superior.\"\n\nMaria laughed, a silvery ripple that made the young man grit his teeth.\n\n\"Maybe he's jealous,\" she suggested. \"Or bored. What do you fellows\nhave to do, anyway, except go around handing out cell work and picking\nit up?\"\n\n\"There is no place on Greenhaven for idle hands,\" said the young man,\neyeing the untouched sewing with disapproval.\n\n\"Isn't there ever any excitement? How often does someone try to escape?\"\n\n\"It is forbidden to escape,\" said the guard soberly. He looked as if he\nwished that he himself could escape.\n\nHeavy steps halted outside the door of the cell to signal the arrival\nof the chief warden. The latter turned a severely inquiring stare upon\nthe young man, who hastily stepped aside to admit his chief.\n\n\"Have you been conversing with the prisoner?\" asked the older man.\n\nHe was clad in a similar uniform with, perhaps, a slightly higher\ncollar. His dark-browed features reflected greater age and asceticism.\nOtherwise, Maria thought ruefully, there was little to choose between\nthem. He seemed to have a chilling effect upon the guard.\n\n\"Only in the line of duty, sir,\" the young man responded.\n\nThe warden spotted the basket of undone work. He frowned.\n\n\"This should have been attended to long ago,\" he said. \"What excuse can\nthere be?\"\n\nMaria planted both hands on her hips.\n\n\"Plenty!\" she announced. \"In the first place, you have no right to hold\na Terran citizen in a hole like this. In the second, that ridiculous\nfive year sentence is going to be appealed and cancelled as soon as the\nTerran consul gets things moving.\"\n\n\"That is at least doubtful,\" retorted the warden, favoring her with\na wintry smile which raised the corners of his mouth an eighth of an\ninch. \"Meanwhile, there are methods we can use to enforce obedience.\nWould you rather I summon some of the women of the staff?\"\n\n\"I'd rather you'd explain to me what was so awful about trying to buy a\npicture of the city in that little shop? If they weren't for tourists\nto buy, why did they have them?\"\n\n\"Such nonsensical objects are provided for tourists and others who\nmust from time to time be admitted to Greenhaven. That does not excuse\nflouting our laws and seeking to cause dissatisfaction through the\nexample of bribery. The city of First Haven has been wrung from the\nwilderness, but the struggle to complete our building of the colony\nmust not be hindered or subverted. It is necessary--\"\n\n\"Aw, hell! You talk like a book too!\" exclaimed Maria.\n\nThe two men stared at her, silent, wide-eyed, utterly shocked at this\nopen evidence of dementia.\n\n\"The price list is sacred to you,\" she snapped, \"but it's all right to\nput that junk on sale to clip the tourists, isn't it? Why doesn't that\nstrike you as being immoral? They're no good, but their money is, is\nthat it?\"\n\nShe turned and stalked back to the shelf-bed, where she sat down and\ndeliberately crossed her legs.\n\n\"You will not be required further,\" the warden told the young man. \"See\nthat you spread not the plague by repeating any of this Jezebel's loose\ntalk!\"\n\nThe guard left hurriedly. Maria discovered the warden gaping at her\nknees, and defiantly tossed her head.\n\n\"You never see a leg before?\" she demanded. \"Or are all the Greenie\ngirls bowlegged? Is that why they wear those horrible Mother Hubbards?\"\n\nShe gave her skirt a malicious twitch, revealing a few more inches of\nfirm thigh. The warden began to turn red. He muttered something that\nactually sounded closer to a prayer than a curse, and turned his eyes\naway.\n\n\"I hope those in authority will yield to the importunities of your\ndepraved fellow who calls himself the Terran consul, and sullies the\nclean air of Greenhaven by his very--I hope they do deport you!\"\n\n\"Oh, honey! Could you arrange it?\" cried Maria, leaping up and\nadvancing on him.\n\nShe grabbed him just above the elbows, and he broke her hold by\nsweeping both hands upward and outward. This offered Maria the\nopportunity to take a double grip upon his belt. When he lowered his\nhands to free himself, she threw both arms about his neck.\n\n\"I knew someone could fix things up!\" she exclaimed. \"You're going to\nlet me out of here until they decide what ship to put me on, aren't\nyou?\"\n\nThe warden's expression was horror-stricken. With a heavy effort, he\ngot both hands against her and shoved. Maria staggered back all the way\nto the bunk. The warden, apparently not quite sure what he had done,\nlooked down at his hands. He turned them palm up, then, as his gaze met\nMaria's, made as if to thrust them behind his back.\n\n\"Relax, honey,\" she said. \"You were a little high. I don't imagine you\nhave any laws here against shoving a lady on her can--as long as you're\ncareful where you shove.\"\n\n\"May the Founders protect me from a forward woman!\" breathed the\nwarden. \"Will you be still and listen to me, Jezebel? Or would you\ncontinue ignorant of the news I brought?\"\n\n\"What news?\"\n\n\"I am instructed to inform you that you have an official visitor. Do\nyou wish to see him?\"\n\nMaria shoved herself away from the edge of the bunk and assumed a\ndignified stance. She tugged her clothing into order.\n\n\"I should be most honored to receive this visitor,\" she said in\nher best imitation of Greenie formality. \"I deeply appreciate your\nannouncing his presence--at last!\"\n\nThe warden glared at her. Finding no words worthy of the state of his\nblood pressure, he stepped back and slammed the heavy door shut. It\nmuffled somewhat his departing footsteps.\n\n\"I'm out!\" yipped Maria.\n\nShe did a little jig, ran to the door to press an ear against it, and\nturned to survey the cell with the fingers of one hand beating a light\ntattoo against her lips.\n\nShe crossed to the bunk. From beneath it, she dragged the small\novernight bag she had succeeded in obtaining from the ship before\nit had left for the next planet. She began to go about the room,\ncollecting the few odds and ends she possessed and packing them.\n\nShe was fingering the bristles of her toothbrush for dampness when she\nheard returning footsteps.\n\n_The hell with brushing my hair_, she thought. _I'll go as is._\n\nShe threw the toothbrush into the bag, tossed her hairbrush on top, and\nsnapped the catch. She considered herself ready.\n\nThe door opened and the warden ushered another man into the cell. Maria\nfelt a sudden chill.\n\nThe newcomer was a Greenie.\n\nShe looked over his shoulder, hoping for a glimpse of the Terran\nconsul, but there were just the two Greenies facing her. The stranger\nwas nearer in age to the young guard than to the warden. On the other\nhand, the severity of his expression was a challenge to the older man.\nThe uniform was about the same.\n\n\"My name is John Willard,\" he announced flatly.\n\nHe reached into an inner pocket to produce a fold of papers. At the\nedge of one, Maria caught sight of what she guessed to be an official\nseal. Willard opened the papers and turned to the warden.\n\n\"You identify the prisoner before us as one Maria Ringstad, native of\nTerra?\"\n\n\"I do!\" said the warden, righteously.\n\n\"You will please sign this statement to that effect!\"\n\nThere was silence in the cell as the warden held the document against\nthe door to scribble his signature. Maria watched in growing chagrin.\nWillard folded the statement of identification, returned it to his\npocket, and faced her.\n\n\"Maria Ringstad,\" he said, \"I am to inform you that your appeal has\nbeen denied. You will accompany me to Corrective Farm Number Five,\nwhere I will deliver you to the authorities who will supervise the\nserving of your sentence.\"\n\nMaria dropped her bag.\n\n\"_What?_ You're lying! Let me see those phony papers! This is some sort\nof--\"\n\nWillard let her have the back of his left hand across the face. Maria\nnever saw it until she was falling. She sat down with a thump, her legs\nstretched out straight before her.\n\nUnbelievingly, she watched Willard sign a copy of his order for the\nwarden. The latter examined it with satisfaction before tucking it\naway. They turned to look down at her, and Willard announced that he\nwas ready to leave.\n\nHe seemed to think that a good way to forestall an argument was to get\nher moving as quickly as possible. He yanked on one elbow, the warden\npulled on the other, and Maria headed for the door at a smart trot,\nwondering how she had risen.\n\n\"My bag!\" she protested.\n\n\"I have it,\" said Willard.\n\n\"Turn left for the stairs,\" said the warden.\n\n\"I'm not going!\" she yelled.\n\n\"Yes, you are,\" said Willard.\n\n\"Yes, you are!\" echoed the warden.\n\nThey reached the head of the stairs, where the warden released his\ngrip. Willard shoved her forward, and the two of them descended with\nbreakneck lack of balance. At the bottom, they paused for the warden to\ncatch up.\n\nMaria seized the chance to kick Willard in the shin. He turned white,\nbut urged her on as the warden led the way through a barred door into\nan open courtyard. They crossed the courtyard by fits and starts, with\nMaria expressing her opinion in words she had never before uttered.\nThe meaning of certain of them still eluded her, but Willard seemed to\nunderstand the general drift.\n\nThe warden spoke to a guard, ordering him to open the main gate.\nWillard boosted her through with a knee in the behind. The massive\nportal swung to with a thud, leaving them out in the street.\n\n\"I'll be damned if I go to any prison farm!\" Maria shouted in his ear.\n\"I demand to see the Terran consul! This is an outrage!\"\n\nWillard glared at a passing Greenie who seemed disposed to look on.\nHe tightened his grip on Maria's arm, the better to tow her twenty\nfeet down the street away from the gate. There, he backed her roughly\nagainst the blank granite wall.\n\n\"If you don't shut your face,\" he growled between set teeth, \"I'll\n_really_ belt you one!\"\n\nMaria gasped in a breath and looked at him. It was easy, since he had\nthrust his face to within a few inches of hers. Little droplets of\nperspiration stood out on his forehead.\n\nHe looked scared.\n\n\n\n\nSEVEN\n\n\nWestehvelt was still sitting with Joe Rosenkrantz in the communications\nroom when Colborn's call came through. He looked over Joe's shoulder as\nthe operator swiveled to face his telephone viewer.\n\n\"How come you remembered the number?\" he greeted Colborn. \"Did the\nelevator doors close on you?\"\n\n\"Very-funny-ha-ha!\" retorted Colborn. \"Look, Joe--have you got power?\"\n\nWestervelt peered closer, thinking that the redhead looked unusually\nconcerned. Rosenkrantz seemed not to have noticed.\n\n\"Power?\" he said. \"Have I got power! I can pull in stations you never\nheard of, just on willpower! _You_--you poor slob--you don't even\nremember if you're on your way home or coming to work! What is it now?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is,\" shouted Colborn. \"It's a power failure!\nThey don't even have any lights out in the street. I nearly got\ntrampled to death getting back in the lobby to phone you.\"\n\nWestervelt and Rosenkrantz looked at each other.\n\n\"Come to think of it, Charlie,\" said the operator, \"the lights did\nblink a minute ago. I wonder if that was our own power taking over for\nthe whole floor?\"\n\nThey saw Colborn turn his head, and heard him expostulating with\nsomeone who plainly was impatient to get into the phone cubicle.\n\n\"I'll go check the meters,\" said Rosenkrantz. \"Watch the space set for\nme, Willie!\"\n\n\"Whuh-wh-wha?\" stuttered Westervelt, groping after him. \"Charlie! He\nwent away! What do I do if a call comes in?\"\n\nColborn finished dealing with his own problem downstairs, and returned\nhis attention to Westervelt. He requested a repeat.\n\n\"I said that Joe went around the corner to check the power,\" babbled\nthe youth. \"What do I do if a space call comes in? He said to watch the\nset.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Colborn. \"You see the little red, star-shaped light at the\nleft of the board under the screen?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah! It's out, Charlie!\"\n\n\"Well, it should be. It's an automatic call indicator set for our code.\nIf it goes on, it shows you're getting a call even if you have the\nscreen too dark or the audio too low to notice. So you look for a green\none like it on the other side....\"\n\n\"Yeah. I see it.\"\n\n\"You push the button beside it, and our code goes out automatically to\nacknowledge. Then you push the next button underneath, which puts out a\nrepeating signal to stand by. Got that so far?\"\n\n\"I got it,\" said Westervelt. \"Then what?\"\n\n\"Then you go scream for Joe at the top of your lungs. That covers\neverything. You are now a deep-space operator. Just don't touch any of\nthose buttons until you get a license!\"\n\n\"But, Charlie--!\"\n\nHe was saved by the return of Rosenkrantz, for whom he thankfully\nvacated space before the phone. Colborn was again engaged in making\nfaces at some other desperate commuter.\n\n\"You were right, Charlie,\" said Rosenkrantz. \"We're strictly on our\nown private power. The whole floor, as near as I can tell. I thought\nthey were being fussy when they put it in, but maybe it will pay off at\nthat. How does it look down there?\"\n\n\"It's a mess,\" said Colborn. \"You wouldn't believe there were so many\npeople working in our building.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" said Rosenkrantz. \"I mean, what's the situation? Is it just\nthis building that's cut off, or the whole city, or what?\"\n\n\"You can't believe anything they're saying,\" Colborn told them, \"but\nthey had somebody yapping on the public address system. It seems\nthere's a whole section of the city, about fifty blocks square, cut\noff. They're talking about a main cable overloading.\"\n\n\"I can imagine what they're saying,\" said Rosenkrantz. \"The poor guys\nstuck with finding and replacing it, I mean.\"\n\nColborn gave a hollow laugh.\n\n\"You think they're the only ones stuck? There ain't a single subway\nbelt moving to the surburban heliports. All the local surface monorails\nare stopped. You should see the way they're packing the ground taxis,\nand the cops won't let any more helicabs come down.\"\n\n\"They're supposed only to pick up from the roofs,\" said Rosenkrantz.\n\n\"That isn't where the people are. The people are all down here with me,\nand half of them are trying to get in the booth to tell their wives\nthey won't be home. Well, there's a lot of us won't get home tonight,\nif the boys don't find that break pretty soon.\"\n\nWestervelt and Rosenkrantz exchanged glances. The youth shrugged; he\nhad been planning on staying late anyhow.\n\n\"Tell him to come back up, Joe,\" he suggested. \"We have food in the\nlocker for visitors, and he can clear a table in here to snooze on.\"\n\nColborn had heard him, and was shaking his head.\n\n\"I'd like nothing better, Willie,\" he said, \"but I might as well start\nwalking. It's better on the level than on the stairs.\"\n\n\"What do you mean--stairs?\"\n\n\"I don't know about the other buildings around here, but they\nregretfully announced that there will be no elevators running above\nthe seventy-fifth floor in this one. In fact, they only have partial\nservice that high, on the building's emergency power generator.\"\n\nRosenkrantz looked worried. Broodingly, he fumbled out a box of\ncigarettes.\n\n\"What do you think, Charlie?\" he asked. \"I mean ... Lydman.\"\n\n\"That's why I called,\" said Colborn. \"I think you better check the\nstairs and tell Smith. If he starts our boy down them, the ninety-nine\nfloors will give him something to keep his mind busy.\"\n\nThe pressure from outside finally intimidated him into switching off.\nThe last they saw of him on the fading phone screen, he was striving\ndesperately to ease himself out of the booth in the face of a bellowing\nrush of harried commuters for the phone. Joe sighed, trying to light\nhis smoke from the wrong end of the box.\n\n\"I'm going to check our elevator, Joe,\" Westervelt said.\n\nHe left the communications room and trotted up the corridor and around\nthe corner. Through the main doors, he caught sight of Pauline peering\nout of her compartment. A thought struck him.\n\nHe hurried over to her and thrust his head close to the opening in her\nglass partition.\n\n\"Were you still on that line, Cutie?\" he demanded.\n\n\"What line?\" demanded Pauline indignantly. \"Oh, Willie, does this mean\nwe have to walk down twenty-five floors tonight?\"\n\n\"You little--Listen! Don't let out a peep about this until we know\nmore!\"\n\n\"Why not, Willie?\"\n\n\"Do you want to get everybody upset? How can they dream up brilliant\nideas while they're worrying about ordering sandwiches sent up?\nPromise!\"\n\nPauline reluctantly gave her word not to say anything without\nconsulting him. Westervelt returned to the hall, where he pressed the\nbutton for the elevator.\n\nHe waited about three times as long as it usually took to get a\ncar, then tried again with the same lack of results. Looking up, he\ndiscovered that even the red light over the entrance to the stairs was\nout. That, apparently, had not been part of the ninety-ninth floor\nsystem now powered by their own generator.\n\nWestervelt took the few steps to the doorway concealing the stairs.\nThere was a beautifully reproduced notice on the door, informing all\npersons that this was an emergency exit and that the door would open\nautomatically in case of fire or other emergency. It further offered\ndetailed directions on how to leave, which in simple language meant \"go\ndownstairs.\"\n\n\"The door is shut,\" muttered Westervelt, \"so that proves there isn't\nany emergency.\"\n\nHe tried the handle. It did not budge, except for a slight clicking.\n\nFeeling slightly uneasy, he leaned over to squint at the crack of the\ndoor. He spotted the latch, a sturdy bar, and saw that he was moving\nit. There was, however, another bar which did not move, and the door\nrefused to slide open.\n\n\"Of course,\" he breathed. \"It's made to open automatically. How would\nthey do that? By electricity. What haven't we got plenty of? The damn'\nthing's locked! Somebody designed a beautiful set-up!\"\n\nHe looked about the empty corridor, jittering indecisively.\n\n\"I could call downstairs before I tell Smitty,\" he reminded himself.\n\nFor the sake of having a handy shoulder to cry on, he went all the way\nback to the communications room to use a phone. He made a gesture of\nthrowing up his hands as Joe looked around, then got Pauline on the\nphone.\n\n\"See if you can get me the building manager's office,\" he requested.\n\"Don't be surprised if it's busy for a couple of minutes.\"\n\nIt was nearer fifteen minutes before his call went through. During\nthat time, he learned that Rosenkrantz took a serious view of the\ninconvenience.\n\n\"I guess you heard some of the talk about Bob Lydman,\" said the\noperator. \"Well, some is imagination, but a lot of it's true. He spent\na long time in a hellhole out among the stars; and if there's anything\nthat might shove him off course, it's the idea that he can't get _out_.\nNo matter where he is, he has to know he can leave when he feels like\nit!\"\n\n\"But if he doesn't know about it?\" asked Westervelt.\n\n\"How long can you keep it quiet? I bet you can see a blackout from the\nwindow. Watch the set--I'll take a look.\"\n\n\"Aw, now, wait a minute, Joe!\"\n\nWestervelt's consternation was diverted by the call that came through\nat that moment. A perspiring face with ruffled gray hair--which\nWestervelt could remember having seen occasionally about the lobby\ndownstairs, looking extremely sleek and well-groomed--appeared on the\nphone screen.\n\n\"If you're above the seventy-fifth, walk down that far. If you're\nlower, walk down as far as you can,\" said the man hoarsely. \"If you can\nstay put, that's the best thing.\"\n\n\"Tell me, what--?\"\n\n\"Power failure, not responsibility of the building management,\" said\nthe sweating gentleman. \"Please co-operate!\"\n\n\"But what--?\"\n\n\"We're doing all we can and this phone is busy, young man! Will you\nplease--\"\n\n\"The stairs are locked!\" shouted Westervelt.\n\nFor a moment, he doubted that he had penetrated the official's panic.\nThen he saw new outrage in the man's eyes.\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\nWestervelt explained about the door to the stairs. The gentleman\ndownstairs clapped both hands to his moist cheeks. He had begun to look\nnumb.\n\nAfter a long pause, he pulled himself together enough to promise that\nhe would look into the matter. As he switched off, Westervelt heard him\nmuttering that it was just too much.\n\n\"You hear that, Joe?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yeah, an' I didn't like it,\" replied the operator. \"What does that\nleave us ... no elevators, no stairs ... how about the helicopter roof?\"\n\n\"You have to walk up a flight of stairs to get there,\" said Westervelt,\nthinking of the department's three helicopters garaged on their private\ntower roof. \"It's the same door. I suppose the door at the top is\nfrozen too.\"\n\n\"Well, anyway, that could be worse,\" said Joe. \"That makes two doors\nto knock open, an' I bet your boys have some little gadget around that\nwill do that.\"\n\nWestervelt felt better. There was always a way out, he told himself.\nJust the same, he thought he had better let Smith know about the\nsituation.\n\nHe told Joe where he was going and headed back up the hall. When he\nreached the corner, he tried the door again for luck. The luck was the\nsame.\n\nHe wondered whether to go look in the lab for some burning tool. On\nsecond thought, he decided that if any damage had to be done to the\nbuilding, it was not his responsibility. He turned to enter the main\noffice, flashing Pauline a wink that he hoped would look reassuring.\n\nSimonetta was busy with a case folder but Beryl was seizing an\nopportunity to repair her nail polish of irridescent gold. She eyed him\ncuriously as he bent over to whisper into the brunette's ear.\n\n\"Are they still talking in there, Si?\" he asked.\n\nShe drew away with a mock frown, demanding, \"What's so confidential?\nAre you spying for Yoleen?\"\n\nWestervelt scowled over her head out the window. It was twilight\noutside, and he noted that there were only a few dim lights in nearby\ntall buildings.\n\n\"I just wanted to see Mr. Smith,\" he forced himself to say.\n\n\"Don't tell me that you want to go home, now that you got all the rest\nof us to say we'd stay?\"\n\nShe softened when she saw that he had no wisecrack in readiness.\n\n\"You know I didn't mean that, Willie,\" she said. \"Is something the\nmatter?\"\n\nOf all the people in the department, Simonetta was the one he found\nit easiest to confide in. He had to struggle with himself, especially\nsince he saw no reason why she should not know.\n\n\"I ... uh ... just wanted to see him a minute,\" he said lamely. \"I'll\ncome back later.\"\n\nHe got out of the office, feeling his neck burn under the combined\nstares of the two girls.\n\nIn the corridor, he halted to survey the sealed-off means of egress.\nBoth the elevator and the stairway door looked normal enough except for\nthe red exit light being dark. Westervelt wondered if it would be smart\nto go around and adjust all the window filters so that no one would\nexpect to see many city lights should they happen to glance outside.\n\nHe went over to the door for one last examination, wishing that it were\na hinged type instead of sliding. While he was bending to peep at the\nlock, he heard a sound behind him and leaped up guiltily.\n\nSmith stood six feet away, outside the hall door of his office. He had\nplanted one fist on his hip and was running the other hand through his\nrumpled hair as he gaped at Westervelt.\n\n\"There's no keyhole there, Willie,\" he said at last.\n\nWestervelt had the feeling that he ought to offer the perfectly simple\nexplanation with which he had been living for what seemed like hours.\nThe words refused to come.\n\n\"Does this have anything to do with the message Si just brought me?\"\ndemanded Smith.\n\n\"What message?\" asked Westervelt, clearing his throat.\n\n\"The police called and claimed someone reported seeing, from the air,\nthree helicopters being stolen from our roof.\"\n\n\"Did she say that?\" asked Westervelt.\n\n\"She had the sense to write it down and show me while they were talking\nabout submarines. Something about the way she winked made me think I'd\nbetter come out, so I told the boys I was going down the hall a minute.\"\n\nWestervelt heaved a sigh. He would not have to be alert to duck an\naroused Lydman charging down the corridor.\n\n\"Then, Mr. Smith,\" he suggested, \"let's walk down that way in case\nsomeone comes out and sees us, and I'll tell you all about it.\"\n\n\"They shouldn't be out for a while,\" Smith commented, examining the\nyouth doubtfully. \"I started a little argument before I came out.\"\n\nNevertheless, he followed Westervelt around the far corner, to the\nwing leading to the laboratory and rest rooms. They had gone perhaps\nten feet past the corner when Westervelt finished the report on the\nelevators and came to the frozen locks on the stairway door.\n\nSmith stopped in his tracks, as if to run back and check for himself;\nbut restrained himself.\n\n\"You're absolutely sure, Willie?\" he asked.\n\n\"You can check with Joe Rosenkrantz, Mr. Smith. Or you can call the\noffice of the building manager downstairs.\"\n\nSmith rubbed his high-bridged nose as he pondered. His lips moved, and\nWestervelt thought he read the name \"Lydman.\" Then Smith checked off on\nhis fingers, muttering, the stairs, elevators, and helicopters.\n\n\"No wonder they were stolen,\" he said. \"Someone saw a chance to make\nsome easy money with all the helitaxis taken. The police will find them\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile, I guess it's some trouble to us,\" said Westervelt.\n\n\"Yes, it might be some trouble,\" admitted Smith, and this time said it\naloud: \"Lydman! We won't mention it to him yet, right, Willie?\"\n\n\n\n\nEIGHT\n\n\nThe room would have been nearly a cube except for the fact that hardly\nany parallel lines appeared in its design. The corners were rounded and\nthe ceiling slightly arched. The floor, though much of it was obscured\nby a plentiful supply of cushions, was obviously several inches higher\nin the center than where it curved up to meet the walls. All surfaces\nwere the color of old ivory but seemed to be of a more porous material.\nThe cushions could have been cut from slabs of some foamy, resilient\nsubstance that had been manufactured in several rather dull colors.\n\nOn two of the larger cushions placed end to end, lay a blond man, long\nand lean. He wore a dark gray coverall that was loose as if he had lost\nweight. His features had a poor color, a golden tan with something\nunhealthy underlying it. He was, however, clean and recently shaven,\nand his hair was cut short, if somewhat raggedly. He stirred, then\nblinked into the soft light of an elliptical fixture recessed into the\nceiling.\n\nWith a smothered groan, he came completely awake. Very carefully, as\nif from long habit of avoiding painful movement, he rolled to his left\nside and braced one hand against the floor. The effort of sitting up\nmade him bare his clenched teeth.\n\nThe grimace was fleeting. He seemed to have some purpose that drove\nhim on to roll completely off the makeshift bed until he knelt with\nboth knees and his left hand on the smooth floor. As he paused to rest,\nhe held his right hand close to his body.\n\nAfter a moment, he brought his right foot up opposite his left knee.\nAnother rest period, on hand, knee, and foot, was required before\nhe shoved himself away from the floor and slowly stood upright. The\nceiling suddenly looked too low.\n\nHe was tall, perhaps two inches over six feet. His features were\nregular without being especially handsome. A man sizing him up might\nhave expected him to weigh about a hundred and ninety pounds, but\nslight hollows in his cheeks suggested that this would not be true at\nthe moment. His eyes were blue, but the lids drooped and he seemed to\nfocus only vaguely upon his surroundings.\n\nAt length, the man turned and walked deliberately to the side of the\nroom where a doorless opening offered egress into what looked like a\ncorridor. The opening was in the shape of an ellipse about five feet\nhigh and three wide, beginning a few inches above the floor. He bent to\nthrust his head into the hall, peering in both directions but taking no\nheed of faint, scurrying sounds out there. Satisfied, he walked back to\nhis bed, turned over a cushion with his toe, and kicked a small utility\nbag of gray plastic out into the open.\n\nThe man stared at the bag for some minutes before reaching an evidently\nunwelcome decision. Laboriously, then, he knelt until he could slide\none end under a knee and slide open the zipper with his left hand.\nHe pawed out a few items--battery shaver, towel, deck of cards,\ntoothbrush--which he left scattered on the floor as soon as he located\nthe object of his search. This was a many-jointed mechanism of metal\nthat resembled an armored centipede. It was as long as his hand and\nnearly as broad. He held it in his palm as if wondering what to do with\nit.\n\nSome slow process of judgment having blossomed in his mind, he turned\nover the object to press a small stud. The plates of the \"belly\"\nparted. From a recess there, he fumbled out a miniature accessory\nthat fitted easily in the palm of his hand. This was round, about an\ninch thick, and might have been made of black plastic. The man's lips\ntwitched in a tired smile as he hefted it pensively.\n\nWithout moving from his kneeling position, he thumbed a nearly\nconcealed switch on the edge of the disk. Within seconds, the thing\nbegan to put forth music, a diminutive reproduction of the sound of a\nfull orchestra. The man gradually raised his hand until he held the\nlittle player to his ear. His expression remained uncomprehending. He\nlowered his hand, shrugging slightly, and turned off the music.\n\nOnce more, he forced himself laboriously to his feet. Leaving his other\nbelongings on the floor without a backward glance, he strode to the\ndoor with the pace of a man who has just walked five or ten miles. His\nlong legs carried him across the distance in only a few steps, but\nthere was a slowness, a heaviness, in their motion that revealed a deep\nweariness. He raised one foot just high enough to step through the\nopening into the corridor.\n\nOutside, he turned left and walked along at the same pace, passing\nseveral other doors at irregular intervals. That they may have led to\nother rooms with other occupants seemed to interest him not at all.\nHe neither glanced aside nor paused until he came face to face with a\nbarrier, a wall blocking his path.\n\nIt was the first doorway that sported a door, and the latter was\nclosed. It looked to be made of a plastic substance, darker than the\nivory walls among which he had thus far moved, but smoother. There was\na grilled opening more or less centered, but no other markings.\n\nNevertheless, the blond man seemed to know where the portal would be\nfastened. He ran the tips of his fingers along one curved side, as if\njudging a distance. Juggling the black disk in his hand until the grip\nsuited him better, he pressed a second switch, which was concealed at\nthe center of the object.\n\nA thin jet of flame, so white that it far outshone the lighting of the\ncorridor, flared against the edge of the door. He moved the flame along\nthe edge for about two feet. Then he snapped it out and waited with his\neyes blinking painfully. The corridor lighting had been revealed to be\nyellow and dim.\n\nHaving rested, the man took a deep breath and shoved with his left\nshoulder against the elliptical door. It slipped off whatever had been\nholding it at the opposite edge and fell into the hallway beyond the\nbulkhead. He had neatly cut through two hinges on the other side.\n\nWithout looking back, he stepped over the loose door and continued on\nhis way. Eventually, he came to another such barrier, and he dealt with\nit in the same fashion. The third time he was halted, he found himself\nat a vertical column which passed down through an oval opening in the\nceiling and disappeared through another in the floor of the corridor.\n\nThe man hesitated. A vague sadness flitted across his features. Then,\nas if driven by some deep purpose, he approached the column.\n\nIt was about six inches in diameter, and the most regular shape he\nhad encountered anywhere. The surface of it was ringed by horizontal\ngrooves nearly an inch deep, and looked as if it would be easy to\nclimb. From the hole below, there rose slightly warmer air, bearing a\nblend of pungent and musty odors. The man's nostrils wrinkled.\n\nHe stepped to the edge of the opening, then sidled around until he had\nthe greatest possible space on his side of the column. The instrument\nin his hand finally came to his attention as he reached out to touch\nthe grooved surface. He considered it for a long moment. Apparently,\nhe was pleased at the brilliance of the thought that eventually moved\nhim to thrust the thing into a pocket of his pants. He faced the\ncolumn again, and again hesitated. His right hand lifted an inch,\nindecisively, following which a snarl of pain twisted his lips.\n\nSidling around the opening once more until he found himself having\ncompleted a circuit, he let the fingers of his left hand explore the\ngrooves. It did not seem to occur to him to look either down or up,\nalthough faint, distant sounds were borne to him on the current of\nodoriferous air.\n\nIn the end, he leaned forward until his left shoulder came against the\nslim column. He wrapped his left arm about it. A little scrambling,\nand he had gripped it between his legs. Then a slight relaxation of\nhis hold permitted him to slide gradually downward until he slipped\npast the floor line. There were only a few inches to spare between his\nshoulders and the edge of the opening, as if the latter had not been\ndesigned for such as he.\n\nThe next level into which he descended was dark. He continued to slide\ncautiously downward.\n\nAt the second level below his starting point, there was light. The\ncorridor resembled that in which he had begun his journey. He put out\none foot to catch the edge of the opening while he rested.\n\nThis hallway curved not far from the man in one direction, although the\nother side ran straight for about twenty feet before being closed off\nby a door similar to the one he had removed. Around the bend floated\nfaint noises suggesting high-pitched conversation, although they came\nfrom too far away to reveal the nature of their origin. The tall man\nkept one eye cocked warily in that direction.\n\nAfter a few minutes, certain sounds seemed to draw nearer. The\ncluttering \"talk\" faded, but he could hear more plainly a hushed\nscuffling that could have been caused by many feet taking short,\nhurried steps.\n\nThe man released his foothold and slid smoothly below the floor\nlevel just as moving shadows appeared at the bend of the corridor. He\ndropped down the column through four more unlighted levels, reaching an\natmosphere that held a blend of machine oil along with its other odors.\n\nLight filtered upward with the air currents. Somewhere below was a very\nbright level, whence came the rhythmic throb of heavy machinery. This\ndid not resemble the sounds of a spaceship, nor yet a Terran factory,\nbut some considerable work was being carried on. He groped out in the\ndarkness for a foothold, got the other foot over, and wearily pushed\nhimself away from the column.\n\nHe was on a level so dim that he touched the edge of the floor opening\nwith his toe to make sure of its location before moving off along the\ncorridor.\n\nIn the darkness, he went more slowly than before, but made better\ntime than looked possible. Under the circumstances, he reassured\nhimself by stretching out his left hand every few seconds to touch the\nsmooth wall. He walked normally, though not noisily, and his sense of\ndirection was extraordinarily good.\n\nAbout a hundred yards along a corridor that seemed not to have a single\nbend or corner, he slowed his pace doubtfully. A few steps more brought\nhim to another closed door. This one, however, yielded to his shove,\nswinging back to reveal a stretch of tunnel with a bare minimum of\nillumination oozing from widely spaced ceiling fixtures. Here, he could\nsense side doorways his fingers had usually missed along the darker\nstretch.\n\nHe had gone another hundred yards and finally passed two cross\ncorridors, before he was again obliged to stop and rest. He slumped\nagainst the side wall, favoring his right arm and gazing dully before\nhim.\n\nA few steps further along was one of the typical elliptical doorways.\nThrough this one, some light was reflected to the wall of the corridor.\nThe man stared at it in the way anyone in the dark will turn his eye to\nlight. After several minutes, he moved toward it as if impelled by idle\ncuriosity.\n\nReaching the opening, he hesitated. A strange expression flickered over\nhis face. The decision to look or not to look was causing him great\nuneasiness. Finally, he stepped forward and entered a small chamber.\n\nThis was evidently located so as to house another slim column that\ndisappeared upward and downward into unknown levels. Several small,\noval windows were set just below the ceiling, at a height which\npresented no particular difficulty to the man when he stepped over to\nlook through them.\n\nThe scene that met his eye was a wide corridor, so wide that it might\nbe termed a concourse or even a public square. Members of the public\nthat were to be observed frequenting it were very, very far from being\nhuman.\n\nTwo of them scurried past his window, clearly illuminated by lights far\nup in the domed ceiling. They were furry, about five feet tall, lithe\nand cat-like in their movements. Compared to a human, they were slim\nand short-bodied. They possessed three arms and three legs, each set\nbeing equally spaced about their bodies. Now and then, as they walked\nwith short, rapid steps, frequent joints were apparent in all limbs,\nshowing clearly that they were not just muscular tentacles. From the\nopenings at the apexes of their heads, which must have been mouths,\nthey were streamlined in a fashion that made it more natural to picture\nthem swimming like Terran cuttlefish then climbing up and down thick\npoles. The three eyes set about each head were low enough to allow for\njaw muscles.\n\nThe man watched this pair slide down a column set beside the wall\nthat concealed him. Other individuals were scattered about the wide\nconcourse. Almost without exception, they wore nothing more than a\npouch secured by a belt just above what would have been the hips in\na human. Clothing was made unnecessary by handsome coats of short,\nhoney-colored fur that enhanced their feline air. Sometimes, when one\nor another bent or twisted, purple skin would show through the fur.\n\nAcross the concourse, the man could see open stalls that suggested\nshops. Most of them were dark inside, with nettings stretched across\nthe fronts. The general atmosphere was not unlike that of a small\nTerran business section, or even a spaceport terminal, late in the\nevening with business slack and only night workers about.\n\nAbruptly, those abroad scuttled for the walls. A perfectly good reason\nfor the exodus appeared a moment later, as a column of low, long\nvehicles dashed from a high-arched tunnel and shot across the open\nspace. Each was three-wheeled and carried half a dozen individuals\nwearing what resembled thick plastic armor. Cages of metal guarded\ntheir heads and they bore weapons like Terran rocket launchers. The\nconvoy passed out of sight before the man could note more.\n\nHe retreated thoughtfully from the window. At the opening to the\ncorridor, he paused indecisively. He shook his head as if trying to put\nout of his mind what he had just witnessed.\n\nIt might have been prudent for anyone in his position to give the\ncorridor a searching look before entering, but this did not seem\nto occur to him. In seconds, he was striding along in the former\ndirection--if anything, a trifle more briskly.\n\nAs he walked, the muffled sounds from the scene he had examined faded\nin the distance. Once again, he was alone with his own discreet\nfootfalls. Several times, he passed junctions of cross corridors, and\nonce he had to burn open a door; but never did he meet an inhabitant\nof the hive-like city. Either the way had been shrewdly chosen or it\nwas seldom used at this period of the day. Even granting both, his luck\nmust have been fantastic.\n\nThe corridor had begun to assume an almost hypnotic monotony when it\nended bluntly at a column leading only upward. The man perforce was\nfaced with the challenge of climbing it, a prospect which he obviously\ndid not relish.\n\nSighing, he reversed his earlier procedure in sliding down other poles.\nWith only one good arm, pulling himself up was slow work. It was,\nperhaps, only the fact that the levels were constructed to suit beings\nfive feet tall that made it possible for him to make it to the next\nlevel up. He sat with his legs dangling through the opening, panting,\nwhile perspiration oozed out to bead his forehead.\n\nThis time, he was nearly half an hour in recovering and working up\nthe determination required to go on. The corridor in which he found\nhimself ran at right angles to the one below. It was wider and higher,\nas if more traveled, but any such open area as he had peeped at was far\nto the rear. Nearby, however, was a much larger door than he had yet\nencountered. He walked over to it.\n\nWhen a tentative push produced no results, he dipped his left hand into\na pocket for the black disk.\n\nHe seemed to have a good idea of where to locate the hinges on this\ndoor too. When he had burned through, the door was harder to shove\naside because it turned out to be of double thickness. The hinges had\nbeen concealed from both inside and outside. The tall man now found\nhimself only a few steps from another such portal, in what looked like\nan anteroom.\n\nMethodically, he proceeded to burn his way through, squinting in the\nbright light of the flame but otherwise betraying no emotion.\n\nThe last door fell away. Fresh air billowed in around him, and he could\nsee stars in a night sky outside.\n\nWithout haste, he stepped outside.\n\nThe tan, plastery wall reared above him for about ten levels. Off\nto his left, shadows on the ground showed a jagged shape, so it was\nprobable that another part of the building towered upward after a\nset-back. The ground around the exit was perfectly level and bare of\nany vegetation. The nearest life was a wall of shrub-like trees about a\nhundred feet away, and toward these the man began to walk in the same\ntired pace.\n\nHe found, as if by instinct, a broad, well-kept path through the trees.\nA mild breeze caused the long, hanging leaves to rustle. Without\nlooking back, the man followed the path up a gentle slope and over the\ncurve of the hill. At the bottom of the downgrade, two figures shrank\nsuddenly back into the shadows. He kept walking.\n\n\"That you, Gerson?\" came a loud whisper, as the two Terrans stepped\nforward again. \"Come on; we have an aircar over here! Did anyone follow\nyou?\"\n\nThe tall man turned to go with them through a fringe of trees. It\nseemed like a poor time to try to talk, with the possibility of pursuit\nbehind them. The two bundled him into the black shape of the aircar\nin silence, and moved it cautiously through the trees just above the\nground. They raised into clear air only when they had put half a mile\nbetween them and the towering hive-city.\n\n\n\n\nNINE\n\n\nIn the library, between Smith's corner office and the conference\nroom that adjoined the communications center, Westervelt sat and\nwatched Lydman pore over a technical report in the blue binding of\nthe Department of Interstellar Relations. Half a dozen other volumes,\nold and new, technical and diplomatic, were scattered about the table\nbetween them.\n\nThe youth caught himself running a hand through his hair in Smith's\nusual manner, and stopped, appalled. He judged, after due reflection,\nthat it might be worse: he could have picked up some of Lydman's\npeculiarities instead.\n\nProbably, he told himself, he ought to show some better sense and\nimitate the suavity of Parrish if he had to adopt the manners of anyone\nin the department. Unfortunately, he did not like Parrish very well,\neven when he was not engaged in being actively jealous of the man.\n\nSome day, Willie, he mused, you'll snap too. When you do, it would be\njust your style to take after this mass of beef in front of you.\n\nImmediately, he was ashamed of the thought. Lydman had been, in his\nway, nicer to him than anyone else. Moreover, he was far from being a\nmass of beef. Westervelt recalled the sight of Lydman on an open beach,\nwhere he seemed more at ease than anywhere else. The man kept himself\nhard-muscled and trim. Despite the gaunt look that sometimes crossed\nhis features, he was probably on the low side of thirty.\n\n_So he's still quick as well as strong_, thought Westervelt. _If he\ndoes go for the door the way Joe predicts, Willie my boy, you be sure\nto get out of the way!_\n\nIn theory, he was supposed to be helping Lydman research some problems\nSmith had thought up. So far, he had read one short article which had\nbored the ex-spacer and twice gone to the files for case folders. He\nwas very well aware that the real idea was to have someone with Lydman\nconstantly. For this reason, he was prepared further to assume the\ncourtesy of answering any interrupting phone calls. He was determined\nthat any news not censored by Pauline would be a wrong number, no\nmatter if it were the head of the D.I.R. himself.\n\nLydman looked up from his reading.\n\n\"I'm getting hungry; aren't you, Willie?\"\n\n\"I guess so. I didn't notice,\" said Westervelt.\n\n\"How about phoning down for something? Get whatever you like.\"\n\nThat was typical of Lydman, Westervelt realized. The man did not care\nwhat he ate. Smith would have been specific though unimaginative.\nParrish would have sent instructions about the seasoning. The girls\nwould choose something sickening by Westervelt's standards. He shoved\nback his chair and stood up.\n\n\"I'd better see what they're doing up front,\" he said. \"I think Mr.\nSmith was talking about it being quicker to raid our own food locker.\nI'll be back in a minute.\"\n\nLydman raised his gray-blue eyes and stared through him curiously.\n\n\"No hurry,\" he said mildly.\n\nWestervelt thought that the man was still watching him as he walked\nthrough the door, but he did not like to look back. It might have been\nso.\n\nWhen he reached the main office, he found both girls replacing folders\nin the bay of current files opposite Simonetta's desk.\n\n\"How about letting me at the buried treasure?\" he asked. \"The thought\nof food is infiltrating insidiously.\"\n\n\"Willie,\" said Simonetta, \"you'll go far here. None of the other brains\nhad such a good idea. I'll phone for something if you'll see what\npeople want.\"\n\n\"I think Mr. Smith wants to use stuff we have in the locker,\" said\nWestervelt, blocking the way to her desk. \"Hold it a second while I\ncheck.\"\n\nHe rapped on Smith's door as he opened it. He found the chief with\nmost of the papers on his desk shoved to one side so that a built-in\ntape viewer could be brought up from its concealed position. Smith was\nscowling as if obtaining little useful information from whatever he was\nwatching.\n\n\"They're getting hungry,\" Westervelt whispered. \"Is it all right to\nraid our guest locker?\"\n\nSmith shut off his machine, and scrubbed one hand across his long face.\n\n\"Right, Willie,\" he agreed. \"The sooner the better. Take out whatever\nyou think best and pass it around. Meanwhile, I'd better check on the\nsituation downstairs--come to think of it, when you called, did you get\nan outside line and punch the numbers yourself?\"\n\n\"No, but I have an understanding with Pauline,\" said Westervelt.\n\nHe was thinking that Smith had put him in charge of the food, which was\nperhaps a little better than being sent around to take personal orders\nas the girls had assumed he would do, but which was still a long way\nbeneath the conference status he had appeared to have an hour earlier.\n\n\"Good boy!\" Smith approved. \"Then she'll know who I want to talk to and\nthat she shouldn't listen in.\"\n\nWestervelt was far from sanguine about the last condition, but left\nwithout trying to cause his chief any unhappiness.\n\n_Well, so it goes, he reflected. One minute a project man, the next an\noffice boy! If I pick out what everybody likes, I'll be a project man\nagain. But if they like it too much, I'll turn out to be the official\nchef around here whenever someone important stays to lunch._\n\nThe picture of sitting in on a talk with some potent official of the\nD.I.R. and expounding his brilliant solution to a problem, only to be\nrequested to slap together a short order meal, made him pause outside\nthe door, frowning.\n\n\"Now what, Willie?\" asked Simonetta.\n\nHe roused himself.\n\n\"Leave it to me, Si,\" he answered, working up a grin. \"I have\neverything under control.\"\n\n\"I hope you know what you're doing,\" Beryl commented. \"I won't stand\nfor a plate of mashed potatoes and gravy, or anything that fattening.\"\n\n\"You'll have your choice,\" Westervelt promised. \"I wouldn't want\nanything to spoil that figure. Just let me at the locker.\"\n\nHe slipped an arm around her waist to move her aside. The flesh of her\nflank was softly firm under his fingers, and he made himself think\nbetter of an impulse to squeeze.\n\nBeryl stepped away, neither quickly enough to be skittish nor slowly\nenough to imply permissiveness. Westervelt shrugged. He stepped forward\nto the blank wall at the end of the file cabinets, and slid back a\npanel to reveal a white-enameled food locker.\n\nIt was divided into an upper and lower section, with transparent\ndoors that rolled around into the side walls. The lower half was\nrefrigerated. Westervelt opened the upper to explore more comfortably.\n\nMost of the foiled packages contained sandwiches, many of them\nself-heating. Somewhat bulkier containers held more substantial\ndelicacies: Welsh rabbit, turkey and baked potato, filet mignon,\nrattlesnake croquettes, and salmon salad. There were sealed cups of\ncoffee, tea, or bouillon that heated themselves upon being opened, and\nice cream and fruits in the freezer section.\n\n\"Si, let me have a couple of 'out' baskets,\" said Westervelt, holding\nout his hand.\n\n\"Empty?\"\n\n\"All right--your 'in' and Beryl's 'out' trays. Do you expect me to go\naround with everybody's supper stuffed in my pockets?\"\n\n\"Frankly, yes,\" said Beryl. \"But not with mine. Let me see what they\nhave in there!\"\n\nShe examined the array while Westervelt experimented with balancing\ntwo empty desk trays across his forearm. By the time he was ready, the\ngirls had blocked him off, and he had to wait until the possibilities\nhad been debated thoroughly. In the end, Simonnetta selected veal\nscallopini; and Beryl took a crabmeat sandwich for herself and a filet\nmignon for Parrish. Westervelt grinned when he saw that she also chose\nfour sealed martinis.\n\nHis own decisions were simple. Putting aside a budding curiosity about\nrattlesnake meat, he took a package of fried ham and eggs--to see if it\ncould be possible--and a self-heating package of mince pie. For Smith,\nLydman, and Rosenkrantz, he piled a tray with half a dozen roast beef\nor turkey sandwiches, a selection of pie and ice cream, and all the\ncoffee containers he could fit in.\n\n\"Si, pick out something nice for Pauline,\" he requested, noting that\nBeryl was already on the way across the office to Parrish's door.\n\nSimonetta exclaimed at her forgetfulness, pushed aside the container\nthat she had been warming on her desk according to instructions, and\ntold him to go ahead.\n\n\"I'll take her a salad and some bouillon,\" she said. \"The kid thinks\nshe has to watch her weight already.\"\n\nAs an afterthought, Westervelt topped his load with a martini for\nSmith, on the theory that the chief was going to need it.\n\nHe went in there first, let Smith see that nothing but coffee was on\nthe way to Lydman, and made his exit directly into the hall. He made\nthe communications room his next stop, and took what was left into the\nlibrary to share with Lydman.\n\nThe latter took a roast beef sandwich, pulled the heating tab, and\ntore it open after the required thirty seconds with one twist of his\npowerful fingers. Westervelt had a little more trouble with his package\nof ham and eggs, but the coffee cups were simpler.\n\nThey sat there in silence, except for an occasional word, and a brief\nscramble when Westervelt spilled coffee on a list of cases Lydman had\nthought of for further checking. The ex-spacer chewed methodically on\nthree sandwiches, and poured down two containers of coffee, scanning a\ncopy of the _Galatlas_ all the while.\n\nWestervelt found the fried ham and eggs to be a disappointment.\n\n_I should have tried a steak_, he reflected. _Eggs can't be done. Not\nand taste right._\n\nThere was one sandwich left, cold turkey, and Lydman had just begun\non his third, so the youth helped himself. The hot mince pie had\nreal flavor, and he was feeling quite comfortable by the time Lydman\nfinished his ice cream.\n\n\"Shall I get some more coffee?\" Westervelt offered.\n\n\"Not for me,\" said the other. \"If you go back, though, you could pick\nup those folders.\"\n\nWestervelt took the excuse to leave for a few minutes. He stopped in to\nsee if Joe wanted anything, promised to look for bourbon, and returned\nto the main office. He found Simonetta sipping a solitary cup of coffee.\n\n\"Did they leave you all alone?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she said. \"The boss came out and had coffee with Pauline and\nme, but then she had a call for him and he thought he'd rather take it\nin his office.\"\n\nWestervelt stepped over to Smith's door and listened. In theory, it\nshould have been soundproof, so he opened it a crack. Hearing Smith's\nvoice, he pushed his luck and put his head inside. The chief was busy\nenough on the phone not to be aware of the intrusion.\n\n\"Yes, I appreciate your difficulty,\" Smith said, obviously having\nsaid it many times before. \"Still, if there is no way to send us an\nelevator, I would much rather not have a party climbing the twenty-five\nflights to break open the door. If it has to be broken, we can do it.\"\n\nWestervelt recognized the answering voice, hoarser though it now was,\nas that of the silver-haired manager downstairs. He wondered why the\nsight of each other did not make both the manager and Smith want to\ncomb their hair.\n\n\"Naturally, we will make good any damage,\" Smith said. \"Besides, you\nmust have a good many other people on the lower floors of the tower to\nlook after.\"\n\n\"Most of them are displaying the good sense to stay in their offices\nuntil the emergency is dealt with.\"\n\nWestervelt crept inside and moved around until he could see the face\npouting on the screen of Smith's phone. The man now had heavy shadows\nunder his eyes, although he had mopped off the perspiration that had\nbathed him when Westervelt had spoken with him.\n\n\"Well, perhaps we have slightly different problems,\" Smith told the\nmanager.\n\n\"Problems!\" exclaimed the latter. His effort to contain his emotions\nwas clearly visible. \"Well ... of course ... if it is really serious,\nperhaps we can get the police to send up an emergency rescue squad--\"\n\n\"_No!_\" Smith interrupted violently. \"No rescue squad! We do not in any\nway need to be rescued. Not at all!\"\n\nThe manager eyed him with dark suspicion.\n\n\"Is someone ill?\" he demanded. \"We cannot be responsible for any\nlawsuits due to your refusal to let us call competent authorities.\"\n\n\"Aren't you a competent authority?\" demanded Smith. \"Just get the\nelevator working, will you? We'll wait until then.\"\n\n\"There is no way of knowing when power will be restored,\" said the\nmanager. \"You must have a TV set around the office somewhere, so you\ncan hear the news bulletins on the situation as soon as I can.\" He\npaused to pop a lozenge into his mouth, sighed, and added, \"Sooner, I\ndare say.\"\n\nSmith had leaned back in his chair, a stricken look on his face. He saw\nWestervelt, and began to wave frantically toward the hall.\n\n\"I never thought of that,\" exclaimed the youth.\n\nHe burst into the hall from Smith's private entrance, realized he\nwould have to pass the library to reach Joe Rosenkrantz with an order\nfor censorship, and circled back to the main entrance.\n\nHe went in, saw Simonetta still at her desk, and opened the door to\nPauline's cubicle. When he got inside with the little blonde, her\nswivel chair, and her switchboard, there was just about room enough to\nbreathe.\n\n\"Pauline!\" he panted. \"Punch the com room number and lend me your\nheadset!\"\n\n\"This is cosy!\" she giggled, but did as he asked.\n\nJoe answered promptly.\n\n\"Joe, this is Willie. It just so happens that Charlie Colborn was\nchanging transistors in all the personal sets you have down there, so\nyou can't pick up a newscast right now--right?\"\n\nThere was a pregnant pause before one answered.\n\n\"Right. That's the way it goes. Can you talk? I don't see any image.\"\n\n\"I'm with Pauline. It's okay. I mean, it was just a thought, in\ncase....\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Rosenkrantz. \"Should have thought of it myself. Everything\nelse all right?\"\n\nWestervelt told him that it was, agreed that he hoped it would\ncontinue. Then he surrendered the headset to Pauline, who tickled his\nribs as he squirmed around to leave the cubicle.\n\n\"Don't you dare!\" she giggled when he turned on her. \"I'll talk!\"\n\n\"Please, no, Pauline,\" he sighed. \"Anything but that!\"\n\nHe walked loosely past Simonetta, who stared at him unbelievingly, and\nstarted to enter Smith's office again. Behind him, he heard the sounds\nof a door being closed and high heels clicking subduedly on the springy\nflooring. Beryl's voice said something as he began to look around. He\nstopped.\n\n\"What did she say?\" he asked Simonetta.\n\nBeryl had already disappeared toward the hall.\n\n\"She said Mr. Parrish invited her downstairs for a cocktail. He thinks\nthey should have about twenty minutes to relax before going back to\nwork.\"\n\n\"You're kidding!\" gasped Westervelt.\n\n\"No, I'm not! Willie, you've been acting awfully strange. Where have\nyou been ducking to every time--\"\n\nWestervelt was already running for the hall.\n\nHe skidded and nearly fell going through the entrance. Beryl was\nstanding near the elevator.\n\n\"Did you ring yet?\" asked Westervelt.\n\n\"No, I'm waiting for Mr. Parrish,\" said Beryl, in a tone that\nemphasized unwieldiness of an assembly of three persons.\n\n\"Your lipstick is smeared,\" said Westervelt.\n\nBeryl gave him an even less believing stare than had Simonetta, but,\nglancing hastily at her watch, began to fumble out her compact.\n\n\"In here, where the light is better,\" said Westervelt.\n\nHe grabbed her by an elbow and dragged her into the office before it\noccurred to her to resist.\n\n\"Please, Willie! You're _handling_ me!\" she protested coldly.\n\nWestervelt was already out the door again, bent upon taking the other\nentrance to Smith's office, when he saw the hall door of Parrish's\noffice open. He reversed direction in time to meet Parrish as the\nlatter stepped into the corridor.\n\n\"Beryl said to tell you she'll be right back,\" he said, waving a thumb\nvaguely in the direction of the rest rooms.\n\n\"Oh. Thanks, Willie,\" answered Parrish. \"I'll wait inside.\"\n\nWestervelt reached Smith's office before Parrish had completely closed\nhis own door. From the corner of his eye, he saw the blue of Beryl's\ndress.\n\n\"Mr. Smith!\" he called as he thrust his head inside. \"I think I need\nhelp!\"\n\n\n\n\nTEN\n\n\nThe first sensation that penetrated, agonizingly, to Taranto's\nconsciousness was that of heat. Heat, and then the damp itch of soaking\nsweat.\n\nThe next feeling, as he groggily sought to take up the slack in his\nhanging jaw, was thirst. It was a raging demand that brought him\nentirely awake. Before he could control himself, he had emitted a groan.\n\nImmediately, he was dropped from whatever had been supporting him in a\nswaying, dipping fashion. He landed with a thud on the hard ground.\n\nA chatter of Syssokan broke out above him. It was answered by other\nSyssokan voices farther away. Taranto kept his eyes closed and lay\nlimply where he had sprawled, while he tried to figure out what had\ngone wrong.\n\nShortly before dawn, he and Meyers had each swallowed his capsule as\ndirected. He remembered a period of vague drowsiness after that, then\nnothing more until he had been awakened just now. From his still dizzy\nmind, he sought to drag the outline of events expected.\n\nThey had hoped to be taken out to the desert, possibly to a Syssokan\nburial ground according to the local custom, and left to be dried by\nthe dessicating blaze of the sun. It had been planned that a spaceship\nwould land in the late afternoon to pick them up. Undoubtedly, it would\ntake the Syssokans several hours to report the \"deaths\" and to secure\nofficial permission for disposal of the bodies, even though they were\nless given to red tape than Terrans. Still, they should have abandoned\nthe \"bodies\" long before Taranto had expected to awake.\n\nHe risked opening one eye a slit. Syssokan legs crowding around blocked\nhis view, but he could tell that it was dusk. The heat he felt must be\nthat of sand and rocks that had baked all day.\n\nIt must have taken the Syssokans a long time to get this far. He\nwondered whether they had brought him an unusual distance into the\ndesert, perhaps to avoid contaminating their own burial grounds, or\nwhether they had simply indulged in some long-winded debate as to the\nproper course to pursue in regard to deceased aliens.\n\n_My God!_ he thought. _What if they'd decided to dissect us? I never\nthought of that! I wonder if the joker that sent those pills did?_\n\nWhatever had gone wrong, he was well behind schedule. He could imagine\nthe chagrin of the D.I.R. man watching the proceedings through his\nlittle flying spy-eye. Taranto hoped that the spacers hired for the\npick-up were still standing by--at the worst, they would have water.\nCautiously, he tried to move his tongue inside his mouth. It stuck\nagainst his teeth. He suspected that the taste would be terrible, if he\ncould taste at all.\n\n_The heat!_ he thought. _I've been soaking up heat all day and not\nsweating. Now it's jetting out of every pore._\n\nWhatever the drug had done or failed to do, it must have nearly\nsuspended most of the normal functions of the body. No wonder he was\nperspiring so heavily as he began to recover! Even so, he felt as if\nhe had a fever. He began to hope that he had not been carried for\nvery long. Unless he had been lying in the cell--or, better, in some\nexamination room at ground level--for most of the elapsed time while\ndisputes held up disposal of his body, some instinct told him, he was\nvery likely to die.\n\nSomeone rubbed a hand roughly over his face, slipping through the film\nof sweat. At this demonstration, renewed exclamations broke out above\nhim. One of the Syssokans shouted some gabble, as if to another some\nway off.\n\nA moment later, Taranto heard a hoarse yelp that could have come only\nfrom a Terran throat. Then words began to form, and he realized that it\nmust be Meyers.\n\n_That blew the pipes!_ he thought, and opened his eyes.\n\nA Syssokan looking down at him hissed in astonishment. Others, who had\nbeen watching another group about twenty feet away, turned to stare\ndown at Taranto. He was hauled to his feet by the first pair that\nthought of it. One, a minor officer by his red uniform, sputtered a\nquestion at the Terran, forgetting in his evident excitement that he\nwas speaking Syssokan. Taranto wiped his face with his shirtsleeve. He\nwas beginning to feel a trifle cooler as his perspiration evaporated in\nthe dry air, but his surroundings seemed feverishly unreal.\n\nHe could not quite understand what Meyers was shouting now, but even in\nthe hoarse voice could be detected a note of pleading. Taranto thought\nit must be something about water. The Syssokan before him gathered his\nwits and repeated his question in Terran.\n\n\"What doess thiss mean?\" he demanded, glaring angrily at Taranto with\nhis huge, black eyes.\n\nThe Terran tried to answer, but could not get the words out. He\ngestured weakly at a waterskin secured to the harness of one of\nthe soldiers. After a brief moment of hesitation, the officer\nwaved permission. The soldier detached the container and handed it\nsuspiciously to Taranto. Fearing the effect of too much liquid in one\njolt, the latter forced himself to take only a few small swallows. He\nwished he could afford to stick his whole head inside the skin and soak\nup the water like a blotter.\n\n\"You are dead!\" declared the officer impatiently.\n\nThe tiny greenish-gray scales of his facial skin actually seemed\nruffled. Taranto dizzily sought for some likely apology to excuse his\nbeing alive. He decided that there might be a slim chance of getting\naway with a whopper.\n\n\"If it is officially declared, then of course I am dead!\" he croaked.\n\"What d'ya expect. Look how weak I am!\"\n\nThe Syssokan swiveled their narrow, pointed skulls about at each other.\n\n\"I'm in the last minutes,\" said Taranto sadly.\n\n\"What lasst minutess?\" asked the officer.\n\n\"It's the way Terrans pass on,\" asserted the spacer. \"Didn't you ever\nsee a Terran die?\"\n\nThe officer silently avoided admitting so much, running a hand\nreflectively over his thick waist, but his hesitation provided an\nopening.\n\n\"That's the way it goes,\" said Taranto. \"First a blackout ... we sleep,\nthat is. Then the last minutes, the sweat of death, and ... blooey!\"\n\nHe raised the waterskin and sneaked a long swallow, risking it because\nhe feared he might not be allowed another.\n\nHe was right. The officer snatched away the skin and thrust it into the\nlong fingers of its indignant owner.\n\n\"If you are sso dead,\" he demanded, not illogically, \"why do you drink\nup our water?\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" apologized Taranto. \"Where are we?\"\n\n\"What difference iss it to you?\"\n\n\"I ... uh ... don't want to make hard feelings or bad luck by dying in\none of your burial grounds.\"\n\n\"It will not happen,\" said the officer grimly. \"We have been ssent in\nanother place to guard against that. Look back--you can see the city\nover that way.\"\n\nTaranto turned. The outline of the city walls, with lights showing here\nand there on the watch towers, loomed up about five miles away. A small\nrise in the rolling ground of the desert hid the base of the walls\nand the greater part of the rough trail they had evidently followed.\nIt would have been a fine spot for a spaceship to drop briefly to the\nsurface.\n\n\"Do you wish to lie down here?\" asked the officer politely. \"We will\nwait until it iss over.\"\n\nDon't be so damn' helpful! thought Taranto.\n\nHe looked desperately about, striving to give the impression of seeking\na comfortable spot. He felt the situation turning more and more sour\nby the minute. It would be very difficult to feign death successfully\nagain now that the Syssokan suspicions were so aroused. They might well\nmake sure of him in their own way.\n\nNear him stood half a dozen brown-clad soldiers. Four of them, spears\nslung on their shoulders by braided straps, had apparently been\ncarrying him while two others acted as relief bearers. Besides the\nofficer, there was a sub-officer, also in brown but wearing a red\nharness. In the background, a similar group clustered about Meyers.\n\nTaranto saw that he had been tumbled from a sort of flat stretcher\nof wickerwork. It was of careless craftsmanship, as if meant to be\nabandoned with the body it served on the last journey. He wondered if\nit could be assumed to be his property.\n\n\"Don't put yourselves out,\" he said. \"I can't hardly take a step even\nto sit down. It'll be just a coupla minutes now. Good-bye!\"\n\nThe Syssokan officer made no move to depart. Taranto had not really\ndared to hope that he would. He was trying to think of some further\nexcuse when Meyers saved him the trouble.\n\n\"_Help!_ Taranto!\" shrieked the other spacer, bursting suddenly from\nthe group about him. \"I told them we're alive, and they want to kill\nus!\"\n\nHe ran staggeringly toward Taranto, kicking up spurts of sand. His\nshirt front was dark with sweat and dribbled water. He looked wild with\nfright.\n\n\"Ah, they do live!\" exclaimed the officer. \"Seize them!\"\n\nHe seemed to realize only after about ten seconds that he had, this\ntime, spoken in Terran. Evidently feeling that not all his men might\nhave learned that particular language, he began to repeat the order in\nSyssokan. Taranto interfered by swinging his fist at the center of the\ngreenish-gray features. The Syssokan, arms flung wide, sailed backward\nand landed on the nape of his neck in a patch of gravel. Meyers\nscreamed hoarsely as his own bearers caught up to him and dragged him\ndown.\n\nTaranto sprang forward to snatch up the wicker stretcher from the\nground. A long-fingered hand clutched at his shoulder, but let go when\nhe kicked backward without looking around. He raised the stretcher and\nswung it around in a wide arc at the three Syssokans reaching for him.\n\nTwo, having left their heads unprotected, went down; but the stretcher\nframe crumpled. Taranto tripped the other Syssokan, glancing hopefully\nat the sky. There was no sign of the fire-trail of a descending\nspaceship in the deepening twilight. Then he had to duck as the other\nthree bearers were upon him.\n\n\"Get up, Meyers!\" he yelled.\n\nHe met the rush with a hard left that dumped the leading Syssokan on\nhis back. The next hesitated, and was brushed aside by the sixth, who\nhad had the wits to unsling his spear.\n\nTaranto sidestepped the crude but large point that thrust straight at\nhis belly. The shaft of the spear slid along his left ribs, and he\npunched over the outstretched arms of the soldier at the Syssokan's\nhead. He clamped the spear between his elbow and body, retaining it as\nhis attacker staggered back.\n\nTwo or three were now advancing from where a knot of figures seemed to\nbe sitting upon Meyers in the gloom. They did not especially hurry.\nTaranto had begun to reverse the spear to jab at the Syssokan left\nfacing him when he heard a scrabbling behind him.\n\nHe whirled away to his right, ducking instinctively as a body hurtled\npast him. When he faced about, he found that most of those whom he had\nknocked down were again on their feet and advancing. The officer, the\nlower part of his face smeared with purplish blood, ran at Taranto full\ntilt. He screamed an order in his own language.\n\nThe spacer cracked the butt of the spear smartly against the Syssokan's\nhead, sending him down on his face. One of the others, however, managed\nto get a grip on the weapon. Instinct told Taranto that any attempt at\na tug of war on his part would lead to a fatal entanglement. He dodged\naway and sprinted toward the group pinning Meyers.\n\nA Syssokan voice yelled mushily behind him as he concentrated upon\ndriving with the greatest possible force into the writhing group before\nhim. He struck with a crunch that tumbled bodies in all directions.\nTaranto himself felt sand scrape raspingly against the side of his face\nas he half-rolled, half-skidded along the ground.\n\nHis pursuers now caught up to the new location of hostilities. The\nfirst thing Taranto saw as he managed to drag one knee under him was\nthe butt end of a spear plunging at his midsection. The Syssokan behind\nit had his center of gravity well ahead of his churning feet, obviously\nintent upon doing great bodily harm. The spacer wondered for a split\nsecond why the native did not use his point.\n\nThen he twisted hips and torso to his right, drawing back his left\nshoulder. As the spear passed him, he slapped down hard on the shaft\nwith his left hand. The butt dug into the sand, and the Syssokan hissed\nin consternation as he vaulted head over heels before he could release\nthe weapon. The one immediately behind was caught in the center of his\nharness by a flying foot, whereupon he collapsed with a groan across\nthe prone figure of his comrade. Two more, who had dropped their\nspears, reached out toward Taranto, urged on by the officer on their\nheels.\n\nTaranto saw Meyers stagger to his feet. Then the two Syssokans were all\nover him. He skipped away to his left over a pair of limp legs, parried\na groping hand, and brought around the long, low left hook that had\nmade him respected in past years.\n\nIn the ring, he had floored men with that punch. At the least, he\nexpected a fine, loud _whoosh_ from the Syssokan, but the latter\ndisappointed him. He folded in limp silence.\n\nFor a second or two, everything stopped. Taranto stared down at the\nsoldier, slumped on the ground like a loose sack of potatoes. Even the\nSyssokans who were not at the moment engaged in pulling themselves to\ntheir feet also gaped.\n\nLight dawned for the spacer. Those among whom he had gone head-hunting\nkept getting to their feet as fast as he knocked them down.\n\n\"Hit 'em in the gut!\" he yelled to Meyers. \"That's where their brains\nare!\"\n\nHe charged at the nearest Syssokan, lips drawn back in an unconscious\nsnarl. The soldier made a reflexive motion to cross his arms before his\nthick abdomen. Taranto, unopposed, hit him alongside the head with a\nlight right, then whipped the left hook in again as the arms began to\nlift. The Syssokan went out like a light.\n\n\"Come on!\" Taranto shouted at Meyers when he saw that the other had not\nmoved. \"Two of us could do it. Those heads are too little to hold a\nbrain. Kick 'em, if you can't do anything else!\"\n\n\"Are you crazy?\" retorted Meyers, his voice hoarse as much with fear as\nwith thirst. \"They'll kill us! Give up, and they'll only take us back!\"\n\nTaranto sensed someone behind him. He started to run, but two or three\nrecovered Syssokans headed him off. He tried to cut back to his right.\nHe slipped in a patch of sand and saved himself from going flat only by\ncatching his weight on both outstretched hands. One of the Syssokans\nlanded across his back, feeling blindly for a hold.\n\nTaranto surged up, trying to butt with the back of his head. He was\npromptly wrapped in the long arms of another soldier facing him, as\nthe grip from the rear slid down to his waist. The fellow behind him\nseemed to think he could hurt him by kneading both knobby fists into\nthe spacer's belly, but there was too much hard muscle there.\n\nThe Terran again butted, forward this time, and brought up his knee.\nThis was less effective than it should have been, but it helped him\nfree one arm so that he could drive an elbow backward.\n\nThe officer ran up with a reversed spear. From the look in his big\nblack eyes, Taranto realized that the Syssokan had also learned\nsomething during the melee. That explained, no doubt, why he was an\nofficer. He swung the spear in a neat arc--at Taranto's head!\n\nIt cracked against the Terran's skull. Even though he did his best to\nride with it, he felt his knees buckle. He struck out with his right\nfist, but the punch was smothered by the soldier whom he had kneed.\n\nThe spear came down again. The world of Taranto's existence was reduced\nto a narrow view of a straining, greenish-gray calf showing through a\ntorn leg of a Syssokan uniform. Vaguely, he realized that he was on his\nhands and knees. A great number of hands seemed to be grabbing at him,\nand his own were very heavy as he groped out for the leg.\n\nHe got some sort of fumbling grip, and started to haul himself up.\nThe slowness of his motions alarmed him, in a foggy way. He tried to\ntuck his chin behind his left shoulder because he knew that there was\nsomething ... something ... coming....\n\nIt came. The Syssokan officer's big foot took him behind the ear with a\nbrutal thump.\n\nTaranto, however, sinking into gray nothingness, did not really feel\nit....\n\n\n\n\nELEVEN\n\n\nSmith stood at the corner of the corridor, leaning back every half\nminute or so to peek around at the stretch leading toward the library\nand communications room.\n\nWestervelt had propped himself with folded arms against the opposite\nwall, facing the door to the stairs.\n\nBeryl hovered behind Parrish, who faced Smith impatiently between\ndarting glares at Westervelt.\n\n\"All right, I guess I have to tell you, Pete,\" said Smith in a low\ntone. \"You might say we are temporarily inconvenienced.\"\n\n\"By him?\" asked Parrish, jerking a thumb in Westervelt's direction.\n\"That I could understand. The kid's beginning to think he's a comedian.\nHe started out just now playing Charley's Aunt.\"\n\n\"Sssh!\" said Smith softly.\n\nWestervelt turned his head toward the main entrance, wondering how far\nParrish's voice had carried.\n\nSmith's dapper assistant looked from one to the other. Seeking some\nevidence of sanity, he turned with raised eyebrows to Beryl. The blonde\nrounded her blue eyes at him and shrugged.\n\n\"Pete, this is no joke,\" insisted Smith. \"I wish it hadn't gotten\naround so fast, but there it is.\"\n\n\"There _what_ is?\" demanded Parrish, in a tone bordering on the\nquerulous.\n\n\"Well ... there's been some kind of power failure throughout the\nbusiness district. There aren't any elevators running, and we don't\nknow how long it will be until the power company copes with the\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"No elevators?\" repeated Parrish.\n\nHe stared at the sliding doors of the elevator shaft as if unable to\ncomprehend the lack of such service. The idea seemed to sink in.\n\n\"_No elevators?_ And ninety-nine stories _up_?\"\n\n\"Sssh!\" said Smith, glancing down the corridor.\n\n\"What's the matter with you, Castor?\" asked Parrish. \"Are you watching\nfor someone ... someone ... oh!\"\n\n\"See what I'm thinking?\" asked Smith.\n\nThey faced each other for a moment in silence.\n\n\"Well, it ought to be all right, as long as he can get down the stairs\nif he wants to,\" said Parrish. \"I'm sorry, Beryl. We'll have to make it\nsome other time.\"\n\n\"But how are we going to get home?\" asked the blonde.\n\n\"Oh, they'll probably have it fixed by the time we're finished here,\"\nsaid Parrish.\n\n\"Then what's all the trouble about. Why is Willie looking so sour?\"\n\nWestervelt braced himself against the impact of three glances and tried\nnot to sneer. The other two men cleared their throats and looked back\nat Beryl.\n\n\"I'm going to have to ask your co-operation, Beryl,\" said Smith.\n\"First, Pete, I'd like to point out to you a little gem of modern\ndesign. This door here is powered to slide open automatically for a\nfire or other emergency.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Parrish curiously.\n\n\"But there isn't any power,\" Smith pointed out.\n\nParrish reached out impatiently and tried the door. He wrenched at it\ntwo or three times, then bent to peer for the latch.\n\n\"No use, Pete,\" said Smith, glancing down the hall again. \"Willie\nalready went through that whole routine. I've been on the phone to the\nbuilding manager, and there isn't anything he can do except send a\nparty up from the seventy-fifth floor to burn open the door from the\nstair side.\"\n\n\"Is he doing it?\"\n\n\"Well, frankly ... I told him it wasn't necessary,\" said Smith, getting\na stubborn look on his long face.\n\n\"But you know Bob!\" expostulated Parrish. \"If he gets the idea that\nhe's penned in here--\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" said Smith. \"On the other hand, we can always get\nsomething from the lab and break out from this side, provided we take\ncare not to let him know what is going on until later.\"\n\nWestervelt eyed Beryl sardonically. He had seldom seen an expression\nso blended of impatience and vague worry. He wondered if anyone would\nexplain to her.\n\nParrish shook his head.\n\n\"I think it might be better to call downstairs again, and have them\ncome up,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't want to do that,\" said Smith.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"It would get around. Pretty soon, the story would be all over the\nD.I.R.\"\n\nParrish actually leaned forward slightly to study his chief's face. He\nfound no words, but his very expression was plaintive. Smith sighed.\n\n\"We're in the business of springing spacers from jails all over the\nexplored galaxy,\" he said. \"We're supposed to be loaded to the jets\nwith high-potency brainwaves and have a gadget for every purpose! How\nis it going to look if we're locked in our own office and can't get out\nwithout help?\"\n\nParrish threw up his hands. Pivoting, he walked loosely a few feet\nalong the corridor and back, squeezing his chin in the palm of one\nhand. He clasped his hands behind his back, then, and peered around\nSmith at the empty wing of the corridor.\n\n\"Maybe we could dope him,\" he suggested, without much feeling.\n\n\"I should have thought of that,\" admitted Smith, \"but he's finished\neating.\"\n\n\"Can't we find something in the lab to shoot a dart?\"\n\nAs Smith tried to remember, Westervelt interrupted.\n\n\"If you decide on that, I'm not volunteering, thank you. Did you ever\nsee Mr. Lydman move in a hurry? Whoever tries it had better not miss\nwith the first dart!\"\n\nSmith said, \"Harumph!\" and Parrish looked uncomfortable. The assistant\nglanced momentarily at Beryl, but shook his head immediately.\n\nWestervelt followed his thinking. For one thing, Lydman was known to be\ndevoted to his wife and two children; for another, who knew how badly\nBeryl might miss?\n\n\"Now, if everyone will just keep calm,\" said Smith, \"and we can keep\nBob busy, we'll probably get along fine until they restore power. How\nlong can it take, after all? They can't waste any time with a large\npart of a modern city like this cut off. It's unthinkable.\"\n\n\"I suppose you're right,\" said Parrish.\n\nSmith turned to Beryl.\n\n\"What I meant by asking your co-operation,\" he said, \"is that we'll\nneed to have someone with Mr. Lydman most of the time. Willie has\nbeen doing it until now, but we don't want it to look like deliberate\nsurveillance.\"\n\n\"But why?\" asked Beryl. \"I mean ... I see that it worries all of you\nthat ... that he might find out. But what if he does?\"\n\n\"Possibly nothing,\" answered Smith. \"On the other hand, Mr. Lydman was\nonce imprisoned, in his space traveling days. He was held for a long\ntime under very trying conditions; and the experience has left him with\na problem. It is not _exactly_ claustrophobia....\"\n\nHe paused, as if to let Beryl recall other remarks about Lydman. Their\ngeneral air of gravity seemed to impress her.\n\n\"I'll be ... glad to help,\" she said reluctantly.\n\n\"Fine!\" said Smith. \"Probably nothing will be necessary. Now, I think\nwe had better go in and tell Si, so that everyone will be alerted to\nthe situation.\"\n\nWestervelt caught the glance that passed between Parrish and Beryl. He\nwas almost certain that each of them was mentally counting the people\nwho had known before _they_ had been told.\n\n_That's what you get for being so busy in the dead files_, he thought.\n\nThey trouped in behind Smith. Simonetta watched as if they had been a\nparade. Smith, with an occasional comment from Parrish, told her the\nstory.\n\n\"So that is the partial reason for staying late,\" he concluded,\n\"although, of course, the case of Harris comes first.\"\n\nWestervelt had wandered over to a window. He adjusted the filter dial\nfor maximum clarity and looked out.\n\nFrom where he was, he could see a great black carpet across part of the\ncity, spreading out from somewhere beneath his position until it was\ncut by a sharp line of street lights many blocks away. Beyond that, the\ncity looked normal. To the near side of the invisible boundary and,\nhe supposed, for a like distance in the opposite direction behind his\nviewpoint, there were only sparse and faint glows of emergency lights.\nSome were doubtless powered by buildings with the equipment for the\npurpose, others were the lights of police and emergency vehicles on the\nground or cruising low between the taller buildings.\n\n_I wonder what they actually do when something like this happens?_ he\nthought. _What if they think they have it fixed, turn on the juice\nagain, and it blows a second time?_\n\nHis reverie was interrupted by the sound of Simonetta's phone. From\nwhere he was, he could see Joe Rosenkrantz's features as the operator\nasked for Smith.\n\n\"Oh, there you are, Mr. Smith,\" said Joe. \"Pauline has been trying all\nover. Trident is transmitting, and I thought you would want to be here.\nThey say they have a relay set up right to Harris.\"\n\nSmith let out a whoop and made for the door.\n\n\"He'll be right there,\" Simonetta told the grinning TV man.\n\nParrish and Westervelt trailed along. When the latter looked back, he\nsaw that Simonetta had replaced Beryl; and he could hardly blame the\nblonde for seizing the chance to sit down and collect her thoughts. He\nfelt like crawling into a hole somewhere himself.\n\nPassing the library, Parrish cocked an eyebrow at him. Westervelt\nnodded. He went in and told Lydman about the call. The ex-spacer was\ninterested enough to join the procession.\n\nWhen Westervelt followed him into the communications room, Joe\nRosenkrantz was explaining the set-up to Smith.\n\n\"Like before, we go through Pluto, Capella VII, and an automatic relay\non an outer planet of the Trident system, but you won't see anything of\nthat. It's after we get Johnson that the fun begins.\"\n\nHe leaned back in his swivel chair before the screen and surveyed the\ngroup.\n\n\"Johnson is gonna _think_ to a fish near his island. This fish thinks\nto one swimming near Harris. They claim Harris answers.\"\n\nSmith ran both hands through his hair.\n\n\"We try anything,\" he said. \"Let's go!\"\n\nJoe got in contact with Johnson, the Terran D.I.R. man, among other\nthings, on Trident. The latter was not quite successful in hiding an\nI-told-you-so attitude.\n\n\"Harris himself confirms that he is being held on the ocean floor,\" he\nsaid. \"He seems to be a sort of pet, or curiosity.\"\n\n\"Can you make sense out of the messages?\" asked Smith. \"I mean,\nis there any difficulty because of a language barrier? We don't\nwant to make some silly assumption and find out it was based on a\nmisunderstanding.\"\n\nAfter the weird pause caused by the mind-numbing distance, Johnson\nreplied.\n\n\"There isn't any language barrier in a thought, but you might say\nthere's sometimes an attitude barrier. Usually, we can pick up an\nequivalent meaning if we assume, for instance, that our time sense is\nsimilar to that of these fish.\"\n\n\"Well, try asking Harris how deep he is,\" suggested Smith.\n\nThey watched Johnson look away, although the man did not seem to be\ngoing through any marked effort of concentration. Hardly thirty seconds\nof this had elapsed when they saw him scowl.\n\n\"This fish off my beach can't get it through his massive intellect that\nhe can't think directly to another fish at your position. He thinks\nyou must be pretty queer not to have someone to do your thinking for\nyou.\"\n\nSmith turned a little red. Westervelt admired Joe Rosenkrantz's\npokerface. Johnson appeared to be insisting.\n\n\"Harris says he is two minutes' swim under the surface,\" he reported.\n\n\"Well, how far from your position, then?\" asked Smith.\n\nThe distance turned out to be a day-and-a-half swim.\n\n\"Does he need anything? Are they keeping him under livable conditions?\"\n\nThe pause, and Johnson relayed, \"They pump him air and feed him. He\nneeds someone to get him out.\"\n\n\"How can we find him?\" asked Smith. \"Can he work up any way of\nsignaling us?\"\n\n\"You are signaling him now, he says. He wants you to get him out.\"\n\nSmith looked around him for questions. Lydman suggested asking how\nHarris was confined. Smith put it to Johnson, and after the maddening\npause, got an answer.\n\n\"He says he's in a big glass box like a freight trailer. It's like a\ncage. Inside, he is free to move around, and he wants to get out.\"\n\n\"Then have him tell us where it is!\" snapped Smith.\n\n\"He doesn't know,\" came the reply. \"They move about every so often.\"\n\n\"What did I say?\" whispered Parrish. \"Nomadic.\"\n\nNo one took the time to congratulate him because Smith was asking\nwhat the Tridentians were like. Johnson's mental connection seemed\nto develop static. They saw him shake his head as if to clear it. He\nturned a puzzled expression to the screen.\n\n\"I didn't get that very plainly,\" he admitted. \"A sort of combination\nof thoughts--they feed him and they don't taste good.\"\n\n\"Well, tell your fishy friend to keep his own opinions out of it,\"\nsaid Smith, surprising Westervelt, who had not quite caught up to the\nsituation.\n\nJohnson, a moment later, grimaced. His expression became apologetic.\n\n\"Don't say things like that!\" he told Smith, turning again to the\nscreen. \"It slipped through my mind as I heard you, and he didn't like\nit!\"\n\n\"Who? Harris?\"\n\n\"No, the fish at his end. I apologized for you.\"\n\nThere was a general restless shifting of feet in the Terran office.\nSmith seemed, in the dim lighting of the communications room, to flush\na deeper shade.\n\n\"And what does Harris say?\"\n\nJohnson inquired. Harris requested that they get him out.\n\n\"Goddammit!\" muttered Smith. \"He must be punchy!\"\n\n\"It happens,\" Lydman reminded him softly.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Smith, after a startled look around, \"but some were like\nthat to begin with, and his record suggests it all the way.\"\n\nHe asked Johnson to get a description of the place where Harris found\nhimself. The answer was, in a fashion, conclusive.\n\n\"Like any other part of the sea bottom,\" reported Johnson. \"And,\nfurthermore, he's tired of thinking and wants to rest.\"\n\n\"Who does?\" demanded Smith.\n\n\"They won't tell me,\" said Johnson, sadly.\n\nSmith choked off a curse, noticing Simonetta standing there. He\ncombed his hair furiously with both hands. No one suggested any other\nquestions, so he thanked Johnson and told Joe to break off.\n\n\"At least, we know it's all real,\" he sighed. \"He was actually taken,\nand he's still alive.\"\n\n\"You put a lot of faith in a couple of fish,\" said Lydman.\n\nSmith hesitated.\n\n\"Well ... now ... they aren't really fish,\" he said. \"Let's not build\nup a mental misconception, just because we've been kidding about\n'swishy the thinking fishy.' Actually, they probably wouldn't even\nsuggest fish to an ichthyologist, and they may be a pretty high form of\nlife.\"\n\n\"They may be as high as this Harris,\" commented Parrish, and earned a\ncold stare from Lydman.\n\n\"I think I'll look around the lab,\" said the latter, as the others made\nmotions toward breaking up the gathering.\n\nWestervelt promptly headed for the door. He saw that Lydman was walking\naround the corner of the wire mesh partition that enclosed the special\napparatus of the communications room, doubtless bent upon taking a\nshort-cut into the lab.\n\n_I want to go sit down a while before they pin me on him again_,\nthought the youth. _I need fifteen minutes, then I'll relieve whoever\nhas him, if Smitty wants me to._\n\n\n\n\nTWELVE\n\n\nThe light, impotent after penetrating fifty fathoms of Tridentian sea,\nwas murky and green-tinted; but Tom Harris had become more or less used\nto that. It rankled, nevertheless, that the sea-people continued to\nignore his demands for a lamp.\n\nHe knew that they used such devices. Through the clear walls of his\ntank, he had seen night parties swimming out to hunt small varieties\nof fish. The water craft they piloted on longer trips and up to the\nsurface were also equipped with lights powered by some sort of battery.\nIt infuriated Harris to be forced arbitrarily to exist isolated in the\ndimness of the ocean bottom day or the complete blackness of night.\n\nHe rose from the spot where he had been squatting on his heels. So\nsmooth was the glassy footing that he slipped and almost fell headlong.\nHe regained his balance and looked about.\n\nThe tank was about ten by ten feet and twice as long, with metal angles\nwhich he assumed to be aluminum securing all edges. These formed the\nouter corners, so that he could see the gaskets inside them that made\nthe tank water-tight. The sea-people, he had to admit, were quite\ncapable of coping with their environment and understanding his.\n\nThe end of the tank distant from Harris was opaque. He thought that\nthere were connections to a towing vehicle as well as to the plant\nthat pumped air for him. The big fish had not made that quite clear to\nhim. All other sides of the tank were quite clear. Whenever he walked\nabout, he could look through the floor and find groups of shells and\nother remnants of deceased marine life in the white sand. Occasionally,\nhe considered the pressure that would implode upon him should anything\nhappen to rupture the walls, but he had become habitually successful in\nforcing that idea to the back of his mind.\n\nAlong each of the side walls were four little airlocks. The use of\nthese was at the moment being demonstrated by one of the sea-people to\nwhat Harris was beginning to think of as a child.\n\nThe parent was slightly smaller than Harris, who stood five-feet-five\nand weighed a hundred and thirty pounds Terran. It also had four\nlimbs, but that was about the last point they had in common. The\nTridentian's limbs all joined his armored body near the head. Two of\nthem ended in powerful pincers; the others forked into several delicate\ntentacles. The body was somewhat flexible despite the weight of rugged\nshell segments, and tapered to a spread tail upon which the crustacean\nbalanced himself easily.\n\nHarris felt at a distinct disadvantage in the vision department: each\nof the Tridentians had four eyes protruding from his chitinous head.\nThe adult had grown one pair of eye-stalks to a length of nearly a\nfoot. The second pair, like both of the youngster's, extended only a\nfew inches.\n\nThe Terran could not be sure whether the undersea currency consisted\nof metal or shell, but the Tridentian deposited some sort of coin in a\nslot machine outside one of the little airlocks. It caused a grinding\nnoise. Directly afterward, a small lump of compressed fish, boned, was\nejected from an opening on the inside.\n\n\"Goddam' blue lobsters!\" swore Harris. \"Think they're doing me a favor!\"\n\nHe let them wait a good five minutes before he decided that the prudent\ncourse was to accept the offering. Sneering, he walked over and picked\nup the food. There was usually little else provided. On days he had\nbeen too angry or too disgusted to accept the favors of sightseers, his\nkeepers assumed that he was not hungry.\n\nIn the beginning, he had also had a most difficult time getting through\nto them his need for fresh water. That was when he had come to believe\nin the large, fish-like swimmer who had transmitted his thoughts to the\nsea-people. The fact that the latter could and did produce fresh water\nfor him aroused his grudging respect, even though the taste was nothing\nto take lightly.\n\nHe juggled the lump of fish in one hand, causing the little Tridentian\nto twirl his eye-stalks in glee and swim up off the ocean bottom to\nlook down through the top of the tank. The parent also wiggled his\neye-stalks, more sedately. Harris suspected them of laughing, and\nturned his back.\n\nLooking through the other side of his tank, he could see--to such\ndistance as the murky light permitted--the parked vehicles of the\nTridentians. Like a collection of small boats, they were of sundry\nsizes and shapes, depending perhaps upon each owner's fancy, perhaps on\nhis skill. Harris did not know whether the Tridentians' craftsmanship\nextended to the level of having professional builders. At any rate,\nthey were spread out like a small city. Among them were tent-like\narrangements of nets to keep out swimming vermin. Other than that, the\nsea-people used no shelters.\n\n_They were smart enough to build a cage for me!_ he thought bitterly.\n_What the hell is the matter with the Terran government, anyway? That\nDepartment of Interstellar Relations, or whatever they call it. Why\ncan't they get me out of here? And where did Big Fish go now?_\n\nHe saw several of the crustacean people approaching from the camping\narea. Shortly, no doubt, he would again be a center of mass attention,\nwith cubes of compressed and stinking fish shooting at him from all the\nlittle airlocks. He snarled wordlessly.\n\nThe groups seemed to come at certain periods which he had been unable\nto define. He could only guess that they had choice times for hunting\nbesides other work that had to be done to maintain the campsite and\ntheir jet-propelled craft.\n\n_I'd like to get one of them in here and boil him!_ thought Harris.\n_Big Fish claims they don't taste good. I wonder. Anyway, it would\nshake them up!_\n\nHe had long since given up thinking about what the sea-people could do\nto him if they chose. Their flushing the tank eighteen inches deep with\nsea water twice a day had soon given him an idea, especially as he had\nnowhere to go during the process. He no longer permitted himself to\nfall asleep anywhere near the inlet pipe.\n\nHe noticed that the dozen or so sightseers were edging around the end\nof the tank to join the first individual and his offspring. Looking\nup, Harris saw the reason. A long, dark shadow was curving down in an\ninsolently deliberate dive. It was streamlined as a Terran shark and as\nlong as the tank in which Harris lived. The flat line of its leading\nedge split into something very like a yawn, displaying astonishing\nupper and lower carpets of conical teeth. This was possible because the\neyes, about eight Harris thought, were spaced in a ring about the head\nend of the long body.\n\n_They know I don't like to eat them, but I like to scare them a\nlittle._ Big Fish thought to Harris. _Look at them trying to smile at\nme!_\n\nHarris watched the Tridentians wiggling and waving their eye-stalks as\nthe monster passed lazily over them and turned to come slowly back.\n\n\"I'd like to scare them a lot,\" said Harris, who had learned some\ntime ago that he got through better just by forgetting telepathy and\nverbalizing. \"Is the D.I.R. man still there?\"\n\n_Which ... what you thought?_ inquired Big Fish.\n\n\"The other Terran, the one on the island.\"\n\n_The other air-breathing one is gone, the other Big Fish is feeding,\nas I have done just now, and it is not clear about the far Terran who\nlacks a Big Fish._\n\n\"All the bastards on both worlds are out to lunch,\" growled Harris,\n\"and here I sit!\"\n\n_You are in to lunch_, agreed the monster.\n\nThe three eyes that bore upon the imprisoned man as the thinker swept\npast the tank had an intelligent alertness. Harris had come to imagine\nthat he could detect expressions on Big Fish's limited features.\n\n\"You're the only friend I've got!\" he exclaimed, slipping suddenly into\nself-pity. \"I wish I could go with you.\"\n\n_Once you could, when you had your own tank._\n\n\"It was what we call a submarine,\" said Harris. \"I was looking to see\nwhat was on the ocean floor. Tell me, is it all like this?\"\n\n_Is it all like what? With blue lobsters?_\n\nHarris still retained enough sanity to realize that the Tridentians did\nnot suggest Terran lobsters to this being who probably could not even\nimagine them. That was an automatic translation of thought furnished\nout of his own memory and name-calling.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"I mean is it all sand and mud with a few chasms here\nand there? Where do these crabs get their metals?\"\n\n_There are different kinds of holes and hills. It is all mostly the\nsame. You cannot swim in it anywhere, although there are little things\nthat dig under the soft sand. Some of them are good to eat but you have\nto spit out a lot of sand. The crabs dig with machines sometimes, in\nbig holes, but what they catch I do not know._\n\n\"Isn't there anything that catches _them_?\" asked Harris bitterly.\n\n_No. They are big enough to catch other things, except a few. Things\nthat are bigger than I am are not smart._\n\nThe monster made a pass along the ocean bed near the Tridentians,\nstirring up a cloud of sand and causing Harris's captor to shrink\nagainst the side of his tank. The Terran laughed heartily. He clapped\nthe backs of his fists against his forehead above the eyes and wiggled\nhis forefingers at the Tridentians on the other side of the clear\nbarrier.\n\nEven after the sand had settled, he ran back and forth along the side\nof his tank, making sure that every sightseer had opportunity to note\nhis gesture. He had an idea that they did not like it much.\n\n_They do not like it at all_, thought Big Fish. _Some of them are\nasking for the man who lets the sea into your tank._\n\n\"Don't call it a man!\" objected Harris, giving up his posturing. \"I am\na man.\"\n\n_What else can I call these men except men?_ asked the other. _I do not\nunderstand why you want to be called a man. You are different._\n\n\"Forget it,\" said Harris. \"It was just a figure of thought.\"\n\nHe felt like sitting down again, but decided against it in case\nthe onlookers should succeed in obtaining the services of the tank\nattendant. He walked to the end of the tank, where he could stare into\nthe greenish distance without looking at the Tridentian camp.\n\n\"I wish I were dead,\" he muttered. \"They'll never get me out of here.\"\n\nBehind him, he heard the plop-plop of food tidbits landing on the floor\nof the tank as the onlookers sought to regain his attention. They must\nhave come out of their moment of pique if they were trying to coax him\nto amuse them further.\n\n\"If I could find a bone in those hunks of fish, I'd kill myself,\" said\nHarris.\n\nThe dark shape of Big Fish settled over the tank, cutting off what\nlittle light there was like a cloud. Harris looked up resentfully.\n\n_I do not understand you_, thought the monster. _That would be very\nfoolish._\n\n\"What--trying to commit suicide with a fish bone?\"\n\n_No matter how, it would be extremely foolish, for then you would be\ndead._\n\nHarris could not think of anything to say. He could not even think of\nanything to think, obviously, since none of his chaotic, half-formed\nthoughts brought a response.\n\n_It would be as if you had been eaten_, insisted his friend.\n\n\"All right, all right! I won't do it then, if that'll make you happy,\"\nexclaimed Harris.\n\n_It has no effect on how well I feed_, Big Fish informed him.\n\nIt took Harris a minute, but he figured it out.\n\n\"So that's your philosophy!\" he muttered to himself. \"Now I know what\nit takes to make you happy. Something to eat!\"\n\n_Where?_ inquired the monster. _I do not see anyone I want to eat._\n\n\"Never mind!\" said Harris. \"Tell me more about the ocean bottom. Where\nthere are big holes or cliffs, can you see ... uh ... stripes in the\nsides, layers of rock?\"\n\n_Sometimes. Where it is deep enough. Other places there are things\ngrowing to the bottom. Only little fish that are not even good to eat\ndo their feeding there. Sometimes the sea-people take away the growing\nthings or dig holes._\n\n\"I'll bet there are plenty of things to get out of this ocean,\" mused\nHarris. \"Who knows how the climate may have changed in thousands of\nyears. Maybe if there was an ice age the seas would have shrunk. Maybe\nthere was a volcanic age. Maybe you could drill underwater and find\noil--if you knew where to look. Maybe there are deposits of diamonds\nunder the ooze.\"\n\nHe stopped when he sensed a vague irritation. He realized that his\nthoughts had been going out and scoring the cleanest of misses.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" he said. \"Just tell me what you do know about the\nsea.\"\n\n_I can tell you where to find tribes of the sea-people. I can tell you\nwhere to find all sorts of good eating-fish. I know where to think to\nother Big Fish but that I cannot tell you, for you cannot feel it._\n\nThe monster rose slowly through the water. He had seen something up\nthere that interested him, Harris knew, and would return when it\noccurred to him.\n\nHe considered the possibilities. Perhaps there was something in the\nidea of building up a food industry. If you had inside tips on where\nthe fish were, how could you miss? Then, the Tridentians must have some\nknowledge of where to find metals, since they used them. He suspected\nthat they had factories somewhere.\n\n\"Come to think of it,\" he asked himself, \"how do I know it isn't some\nsavage tribe that picked me up? One of these days, I may wind up with a\nmore advanced bunch. I'll have to ask Big Fish when he comes back.\"\n\nHe began to plan what he would do if he reached some higher\ncivilization under the sea. Anyone with the knowledge to mine metals,\nor maybe to extract them from sea water, would be interested in\ncontacting Terrans from another world. There would be a little trouble,\nprobably, in getting them to comprehend space, but some of them could\nbe sent up to the surface in tanks. Then there would be a need for some\nTerran who knew both worlds.\n\n\"I could wind up an ambassador!\" Harris told himself. \"I wonder ...\nmaybe I could even work it with this bunch. If I could only get out of\nhere! Come back in another submarine, maybe.\"\n\nHe began to pace the length of his tank and back, stopping once to\ngather up the fish that had been bought for him by some of the crowd\noutside. He noted that the latter was constantly changing without\nvarying much in total number. He took to walking around the sides of\nthe tank, staring into each set of eyes.\n\nIn the end, this had such a hypnotic effect that he imagined himself\nswimming through the dim, greenish light. The sea-people outside began\nto appear as individuals. He grew into the feeling that he could\nrecognize one from the other.\n\nHe found himself running for the corner where he had collected his\nfish. The sound that had triggered the reaction originated at the\nopaque end of the tank. It was followed within seconds by several jets\nof water, white and forceful, which entered near the floor of the\nstructure.\n\nHarris snatched up his supply of food to keep it from being washed\naway. With one hand, he tried to roll up the legs of his pants. He\nnever seemed to be prepared when the time came, but he was constantly\ntoo chilled to go around with the trousers rolled up all the time.\n\nThe water swished about the calves of his legs. After a few minutes, it\nbegan to recede as the Tridentian machinery pumped it out. Soon, the\ntank was clean of everything but Harris, his fish, and the thick smell\nof sea water.\n\n_He was good_, came a thought. _I see you are eating too._\n\nA large shadow passed overhead. Most of the Tridentians wiggled their\neye-stalks in an effort to look amiable. Harris dropped his fish to the\ndamp floor.\n\n\"No, I'm not eating,\" he said. \"I'm all wet.\"\n\n_So am I_, answered Big Fish.\n\n\"But I'm not usually,\" said Harris.\n\n_I know. It is unkind, they way they let you dry out. Would you like me\nto knock in the end of the tank? You could have all the water you want._\n\n\"Not right now,\" said Harris calmly. He sat down, crossing his legs.\n\"I'll have to grow some gills first. It may not take much longer, at\nthat.\"\n\nHe looked at the Tridentians, who looked in at him. Again, he felt the\nsensation of being able to recognize individuals. Perhaps he should\ntalk to them more often through Big Fish.\n\n\"Maybe some of them are really nice fellows,\" he muttered, \"if I just\nget to know them better.\"\n\n_No_, his friend told him, _they are not very good to eat._\n\n\n\n\nTHIRTEEN\n\n\nTime had dragged its slow way past six-thirty. The excuse of a flying\nstart on the Harris case had worn thin to the point of delicacy--to all\nbut one man. The rest of them hoped sincerely that _he_ was keeping\nhimself interested.\n\nWestervelt sat at his desk, perusing an article in _Spaceman's_ World\nabout the exploration of a newly discovered planetary system. It might\ncome up in a conference someday, he reflected, and it might be as well\nto know a few facts on the subject. No life had been discovered on\nany of the dozen planets, but that did not necessarily preclude the\nestablishment of a Terran colony in the future. The department also had\nproblems with colonies, as witness Greenhaven.\n\nHe put down the magazine for a moment to review the personnel situation.\n\nParrish, he remembered, had expressed his intention of retreating to\nhis office and putting in an hour or two of desk-heeling. Under the\ncircumstances, he had declared, there was little point in digging\nfurther into the files for an idea since that was not at all their\nprimary purpose in staying late. Rosenkrantz, of course, was on watch\nin the communications room. Smith wandered in and out. Simonetta had\ntaken a portable taper down to Lydman's office to help organize a\npreliminary report the chief had requested from him. After she had\nreturned, and fallen to low-voiced gossip through the window with\nPauline, Beryl had been sent back with a number of scribbled objections\nfor Lydman to answer.\n\nSmith had spent all of five minutes thinking them up--before Simonetta\nbrought the original report. Westervelt wondered how soon Beryl would\nreturn with the answers, because it would then probably be his turn to\nride herd.\n\nHe did not regard the idea with relish.\n\nSmith strolled out of his office. He halted to survey the nearly empty\noffice with an air of vague surprise, then saw Simonetta outside\nPauline's cubicle. He went over to join the conversation.\n\n_I should have walked out somewhere_, thought Westervelt. _Now the door\nis completely blockaded._\n\nThe magazine article turned dull immediately.\n\nSure enough, in a few minutes Smith approached Westervelt's corner.\n\n\"Who's on watch, Willie?\" he asked, attempting a jovial wink.\n\n\"Beryl, I think,\" answered the youth. \"Must be--she hasn't been around.\"\n\n\"She's been there quite a while,\" commented Smith. \"I have a feeling\nthat it's time for a shift. How about wandering down there and edging\nin?\"\n\n\"What would I say?\" objected Westervelt. \"He's probably dictating his\nremarks and wouldn't like me hanging around.\"\n\nSmith chewed on his lower lip.\n\n\"For the questions I sent him,\" he muttered thoughtfully, \"five minutes\nshould have been enough. Goldilocks has been with him over half an\nhour.\"\n\n\"But he must be tired of my face,\" said Westervelt.\n\n\"I don't have anyone else to send, unless you want me to think up an\nexcuse for Pauline. Asking him to help with her homework would be\npretty thin.\"\n\nWestervelt thought it over. Parrish, in his present mood, was not\nlikely to be of any help. Simonetta had just done her stint, and Joe\nwas needed on the space set. It would have been nice if there were a\nmessage for Lydman to listen to, but that was wishful dreaming.\n\n\"All right, Mr. Smith,\" he surrendered. \"Maybe I can take along this\narticle and ask if he's seen it yet. If he's taking an inventory or\ntrying out something in the lab, I'll take my life in my hands and\nvolunteer to help!\"\n\nSmith laughed.\n\n\"It can't be that bad, Willie,\" he said, slapping the other on the\nshoulder.\n\nWestervelt was not so sure, but he folded the magazine open to the\nbeginning of his article and went out. Pauline peered at him as he\npassed.\n\n\"Don't look like that!\" he said. \"You'll see me again, I hope!\"\n\n\"You might try looking a little more confident of that yourself,\"\nSimonetta called after him.\n\nWestervelt turned the corner and walked slowly down the hall, trying\nout more confident expressions as he went. None of them felt exactly\nright.\n\nPassing the spare office where the dead files were kept, he heard a\nsound.\n\n_They must have come up here for something_, he thought. _That's why it\nseemed so long to Smitty._\n\nHe had opened the door and taken one step inside before he realized\nthat the room was dark. Without thinking, he reached out to flip the\nlight switch.\n\nBeryl Austin leaped to her feet with a flash of thigh that hardly\nregistered on Westervelt in the split-second of his astonishment. Then\nhe saw that she had not been alone on the settee that stood beside the\ndoor. Parrish rose beside her.\n\nThe suddenness of their movements and the ferocity of their combined\nstares had the impact of a stunning blow upon Westervelt. The\nimplications of the blonde's slightly disheveled appearance, however,\nwere obvious.\n\nHe could not, for a moment, think at all. Then he began to have a\nfeeling that he ought to say something to cover his escape. Beneath\nthat, somewhere, surged the conviction that he had nothing to\napologize for. In the face of such hostility and tension, it called for\na lot of courage.\n\n\"You little sneak!\" spat Beryl.\n\nWestervelt noted with a certain detachment that her voice had turned\nshrill. Not knowing of anything else to do, he stared as she tugged\nher dress into place. This seemed to outrage her more than anything\nhe could have said. He also saw the gleam of Parrish's teeth, and the\ngrimace was not even remotely a smile. The man took a step to place\nhimself before Beryl.\n\n\"What do you think you're doing?\" demanded Parrish, with a good deal\nmore feeling than originality.\n\nWestervelt had been wondering what to say to that when it came, as was\ninevitable. A dozen half-expressed answers flitted through his mind.\n\n_How do you get out of a thing like this?_ he asked himself\ndesperately. _You'd think it was me that did it!_\n\nBefore he could explore the implications of his choosing the words \"did\nit,\" Beryl found her voice again.\n\n\"Get out of here!\" she shrilled. \"Who told you to come poking in?\"\n\n\"I heard a noise,\" said Westervelt, conscious that his voice sounded\nodd. \"I thought it was Mr. Lydman.\"\n\n\"Do I look like Lydman?\" demanded Parrish, not raising his voice as\nmuch as Beryl had. \"There wasn't any light, was there? Did you think\nhe'd be sitting in here in the dark?\"\n\nThe possibility charged the atmosphere like static electricity.\nActually, mere mention of it made Westervelt feel better because it\nsounded so much like what he might have found.\n\n\"How did I know?\" he retorted. \"I thought Beryl was with him. Why\nshould I expect _you_? You said you weren't going to dig any further in\nhere.\"\n\nBeryl had been smoothing her still-perfect coiffure. Now she stiffened\nas much as Parrish. Westervelt sensed that his choice of words might\nhave been unfortunate.\n\n\"Well, who is with him?\" he demanded, before they could say anything.\n\nThe question galvanized Parrish into action. He stepped forward to meet\nWestervelt face to face.\n\n\"If you're so worried about that, why don't you go find him?\" he\nsneered. \"For my money, you two make a good match.\"\n\n\"Maybe I will,\" said Westervelt hotly. \"_You_ two don't seem to care\nabout what's going on. If you'll just excuse me, I'll turn out the\nlight and--\"\n\n\"Oh, cut out the speech-making!\" requested Beryl. \"Get out of the\ndoor, Willie, and let me out of here. I'm tired of the whole incident.\"\n\n\"Now, wait a minute, Beryl!\" protested Parrish.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Westervelt, \"you'd better check. Your lipstick is really\nsmudged this time.\"\n\n\"Shut up, you!\" Parrish snapped.\n\nHe took Beryl by the shoulders and pulled her back. She pulled herself\nfree peevishly. Westervelt leaned against the wall and curled a lip.\n\n\"Enough is enough!\" she said. \"Let me out of here!\"\n\n\"You forgot to smile,\" Westervelt told Parrish.\n\nThe man turned on him and reached out to seize a handful of his\nshirtfront. Westervelt straightened up, alarmed but willing to consider\nchanging the smooth mask of Parrish's face. Beryl was shrilling\nsomething about not being damned fools, when she stopped in the middle\nof a word.\n\nParrish also grew still. The forearm Westervelt had crossed over the\nhand grabbing at his shirt fell as Parrish let him go. The man was\nstaring over Westervelt's shoulder. He looked almost frightened.\n\nWestervelt looked around--and a thrill shot through him, like the shock\nof diving into icy water.\n\nLydman was standing there, staring through him.\n\nWhen he looked again, as he shrank instinctively away from the doorway,\nhe realized that the ex-spacer was staring through all of them. After a\nmoment, he seemed to focus on Beryl.\n\n\"They'll let you out, I think,\" he said in his quiet voice.\n\nParrish stepped back nervously, and Westervelt edged further inside\nthe doorway to make room. Beryl did not seem to have heard. She gaped,\nhypnotized by the beautiful eyes set in the strong, tanned face.\n\nLydman put the palm of one hand against Westervelt's chest and shoved\nslowly. It was as well that the file cabinet behind the youth was\nnearly empty, because it slid a foot along the floor as his back\nflattened against it. Lydman reached out his other hand and took Beryl\ngently by the elbow.\n\nShe stepped forward, turning her head from side to side as if to seek\nreassurance from either Parrish or Westervelt, but without completely\nmeeting their eyes. Lydman led her into the hall and released her elbow.\n\nShe started uncertainly up the corridor toward the main office. Lydman\nfell in a pace or two behind her.\n\nWestervelt heard a gasp. He looked at Parrish and realized that he had\nbeen holding his breath too. Then, by mutual consent, they followed the\nothers out into the hall.\n\n\"Listen, Willie,\" whispered Parrish, watching the twenty-foot gap\nbetween them and Lydman's broad shoulders, \"we have to see that she\ndoesn't forget and try to leave. If he won't let me talk to her, you'll\nhave to get her attention.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'll try,\" murmured Westervelt. \"Look--I was really looking for\nhim I never meant to--\"\n\n\"I never meant to either,\" said Parrish. \"Forget it!\"\n\n\"It was none of my business. I should have shut up and left. Tell her\nI'm sorry when you get a chance; she'll probably never speak to me\nagain.\"\n\nHe wondered if he could get Smith's permission to move his desk. On\nsecond thought, he wondered if he would come out of this with a desk to\nmove.\n\n\"Sure she will,\" said Parrish. \"She's really just a good-natured kid.\nIt wasn't anything serious. You startled us, that was all.\"\n\nBeryl and Lydman turned the corner, leaving the two followers free to\nincrease their pace. They rounded the corner themselves in time to see\nLydman going through the double doors.\n\n\"It was too bad he came along when she was yelling to be let out,\" said\nParrish. \"He didn't understand.\"\n\n\"You mean he actually thought we were trying to keep her there against\nher will?\" asked Westervelt.\n\n\"Well, we were, I suppose, or at least I was. He doesn't seem to think\nany further than that in such situations. If someone is being held\nagainst his will, that's enough for Bob. Did you know Smitty had to\npost a bond for him?\"\n\n\"A bond!\" repeated Westervelt. \"What for?\"\n\n\"They caught him a couple of times, trying out his new gadgets around\nthe city jail. I'll tell you about it sometime.\"\n\nParrish fell silent as they reached the entrance to the main office.\nBeryl had gratefully stopped to speak to the first person in sight,\nwhich happened to be Pauline. As Parrish and Westervelt arrived, she\nwas offering to take over the switchboard for twenty minutes or so.\n\n\"Oh, I didn't mean you had to drop everything,\" Pauline was protesting.\n\"I just meant ... when you get the chance....\"\n\nShe eyed Lydman curiously, then looked to the late arrivals. The\nsilly thought that Joe Rosenkrantz must feel awfully lonely crossed\nWestervelt's mind, and he had to fight down a giggle.\n\n\"You really should get out of there for a while,\" advised Lydman,\nstudying the size of Pauline's cubbyhole. \"Sit outside a quarter of an\nhour at least, and let your mind spread out.\"\n\n\"Well, if it's really all right with you, Beryl?\"\n\n\"I'm only too glad to help,\" said Beryl rapidly.\n\nShe wasted no time in rounding the corner to get at the door.\nWestervelt closed his eyes. He found it easy to envision Pauline\ntangling with her on the way out and causing Lydman to start all over\nagain.\n\nThe girls managed without any such catastrophe. Pauline headed for the\nswivel chair behind the unused secretarial desk.\n\n\"You ought to leave that door open,\" Lydman called to Beryl. \"If it\nshould stick, there's hardly any air in there. You'd feel awfully\ncramped in no time.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Beryl politely.\n\nShe left the door open, sat down, and picked up Pauline's headset. From\nthe set of her shoulders, it did not seem that much light conversation\nwould be forthcoming from that quarter.\n\nWestervelt stepped further into the office, and saw that Smith was\nstanding in his own doorway, rubbing his large nose thoughtfully. The\nyouth guessed that Simonetta had signalled him.\n\nParrish cleared his throat with a little cough.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I'll be in my office if anyone wants me.\"\n\nRather than pass too close to Lydman, he retreated into the hall to use\nthe outside entrance to his office. The ex-spacer paid no attention.\n\nWestervelt decided that he would be damned if he would go through\nParrish's office and back into this one to get at his desk. He walked\naround the projection of the switchboard cubicle and sat down with a\nsigh at his own place. He leaned back and looked about, to discover\nthat Lydman had gone over to say a few words to Smith. Pauline glanced\ncuriously from Westervelt to the two men, then began to shop among a\nshelf of magazines beside the desk of the vacationing secretary.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Lydman turned and went out the door. Westervelt\ntried to listen for footsteps, but the resilient flooring prevented him\nfrom guessing which way the ex-spacer had gone.\n\nHe saw Smith approaching, and went to meet him.\n\n\"I've changed my mind,\" said the chief. \"For a little bit, anyway,\nwe'll leave him alone. He said he was sketching up some gizmo he wants\nto have built, and needed peace and quiet.\"\n\n\"Did he say we ... were talking too loud?\" asked Westervelt, looking at\nthe doorway rather than meet Smith's eye.\n\n\"No, that was all he said,\" answered Smith.\n\nThere was a questioning undertone in his voice, but Westervelt chose\nnot to hear it. After a short wait, Smith asked Simonetta to bring her\ntaper into his office. He mentioned that he hoped to phone for some\ntechnical information. Westervelt watched them leave, then sank down on\nthe corner of the desk at which Pauline was relaxing.\n\nBeryl turned around in her chair.\n\n\"Pssst! Pauline!\" she whispered. \"Is he gone?\"\n\n\"They all left--except Willie,\" the girl told her.\n\nBeryl shut the door promptly. The pair left in the office heard her\nturn the lock with a brisk snap.\n\n\"What's the matter with her?\" murmured Pauline.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Westervelt glumly. \"Why don't you take a nap, or\nsomething?\"\n\n\"I'd like to,\" said Pauline. \"It's going on seven o'clock and who knows\nwhen we'll get out of here?\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" said Westervelt. \"I mean ... uh ... don't bring us bad luck\nby talking about it. Take a nap and let me think!\"\n\n\"All you big thinkers!\" jeered Pauline. \"What I'd really like to do is\ngo down to the ladies' room and take a shower, but you always kid me\nabout Mr. Parrish maybe coming in with fresh towels for the machine.\"\n\n\"I lied to you, Pauline,\" said Westervelt. \"The charwoman brings them.\"\n\n\"Well, I could always hope,\" giggled Pauline.\n\n\"Not tonight,\" said Westervelt \"Believe me, kid, you're safer than\nyou'll ever be!\"\n\n\n\n\nFOURTEEN\n\n\nPauline came back in a quarter of an hour, her youthfully translucent\nskin glowing and her ash-blonde curls rearranged. She glanced through\nthe window at Beryl, who was nervously punching a number for an outside\ncall.\n\n\"What's going on?\" she asked Westervelt, who sat with his heels on the\ncenter desk.\n\n\"Mr. Smith is calling a couple of engineers he knows,\" Simonetta told\nher.\n\nWestervelt had just heard it, when Simonetta had emerged with a tape to\ntranscribe. He had started to mention that it might be better to phone\na psychiatrist, but had bitten back the remark.\n\n_For all I know_, he reflected, _they might take me away! Everything I\nremember about today can't really have happened. If it did, I wish it\nhadn't!_\n\nHe recalled that he had been phoned at home to hop a jet for London\nthat morning. He had found the laboratory which had made the model of\nthe light Smith was interested in, and been on his way back without\ntime for lunch. Now that the jets were so fast, meals were no longer\nserved on them, and he had had to grab a sandwich upon returning. Then\nthere had been those poor fried eggs. That was all--no wonder he was\nfeeling hungry again!\n\n_I should have missed the return jet_, he thought bitterly. _I didn't\nknow where I was well off! Why did I have to walk in there? I might\nhave had the sense to go look in Bob's office first._\n\nHe decided that Pauline, now chatting with Simonetta, looked refreshed\nand relaxed. Perhaps he ought to do the same.\n\nThe idea, upon reflection, continued to appear attractive. Westervelt\nrose and walked out past the switchboard. Beryl was too busy to see\nhim. He made his way quietly to the rest room, which he found empty. He\nwas rather relieved to have avoided everyone.\n\nAt one side of the room was a door leading to a shower. The\nappointments of Department 99 were at least as complete as those of\nany modern business office of the day. Westervelt stepped into a tiny\nanteroom furnished with a skimpy stool, several hooks on the wall, and\na built-in towel supplier.\n\nPrudently, he set the temperature for a hot shower on the dial outside\nthe shower compartment, and punched the button that turned on the water.\n\n_Just in case all the trouble has affected the hot water supply_, he\nthought.\n\nAs he undressed, he was reassured by the sight of steam inside the\nstall. Another thought struck him. He locked the outer door. He did\nnot care for the possibility of having Lydman imagine that he was\ntrapped in here. It would be just his luck to be \"assisted\" out into\nthe corridor, naked and dripping, at the precise moment it was full of\nstaff members on their way to the laboratory.\n\nHe slid back the partly opaqued plastic doors and stepped with a sigh\nof pleasure under the hot stream. Ten minutes of it relaxed him to the\npoint of feeling almost at peace with the world once more.\n\n\"I ought to finish with a minute or two of cold,\" he told himself, \"but\nto hell with it! I'll set the air on cool later.\"\n\nHe pushed the waterproof button on the inside of the stall to turn\noff the water, opened the narrow doors, and reached out to the towel\ndispenser. The towel he got was fluffy and large, though made of paper.\nHe blotted himself off well before turning on the air jets in the stall\nto complete the drying process.\n\nHaving dressed and disposed of the towel through a slot in the wall,\nhe glanced about to see if he had forgotten anything. The shower\nstall had automatically aired itself, sucking all moisture into the\nair-conditioning system; and looked as untouched as it had at his\nentrance.\n\nWestervelt strolled out into the rest room proper, thankful that the\nlock on the anteroom door had not chosen that moment to stick. He\nstretched and yawned comfortably. Then he caught sight of his tousled,\nair-blown hair in a mirror. He fished in his pocket for coins and\nbought another hard paper comb and a small vial of hair dressing from\ndispensers mounted on the wall. He took his time spraying the vaguely\nperfumed mist over his dark hair and combing it neatly.\n\nThat task attended to, he stole a few seconds to study the reflection\nof his face. It was rather more square about the jaw than Smith's, he\nthought, but he had to admit that the nose was prominent enough to\nchallenge the chief's. No one had thought to equip the washroom with\nadjustable mirrors, so he gave up twisting his neck in an effort to see\nhis profile.\n\n\"Well, that's a lot better!\" he said, with considerable satisfaction.\n\"Now if I can hook another coffee out of the locker, it will be like\nstarting a new day. Gosh, I hope it's a better one, too!\"\n\nHe walked lightly along the corridor to the main office, exaggerating\nthe slight resilience of the floor to a definite bounce in his step.\nOutside the office, he met Beryl coming out. He felt himself come down\non his heels immediately.\n\nBeryl eyed him enigmatically, glanced over his shoulder to check that\nhe was alone, and swung away toward the opposite wing. Westervelt\nhurried after her.\n\n\"Look, Beryl!\" he called. \"I wanted to say ... that is ... about\nbefore--\"\n\nBeryl turned the corner and kept walking.\n\n\"Wait just a second!\" said Westervelt.\n\nHe tried to get beside her to speak to something besides the back of\nher blonde head, but she was a tall girl and had a long stride. He\nhesitated to take her by the elbow.\n\nBeryl stopped at the door to the library.\n\n\"Please take note, Willie,\" she said coldly, \"that the light is on\ninside and I am all alone.\"\n\n_At least she spoke_, thought Westervelt.\n\n\"I have come down here for a little peace and quiet,\" she informed him.\n\"I hope you didn't intend to learn how to read at this hour of the\nnight.\"\n\n\"Aw, come on!\" protested Westervelt. \"It was an accident. Could I help\nit?\"\n\n\"Being the way you are, I suppose not,\" admitted Beryl judiciously.\n\"Why don't you go elsewhere and be an accident again?\"\n\n\"I'm trying to say I'm sorry,\" said Westervelt, feeling a flush\nspreading over his features. \"I don't know why I have to apologize,\nanyway. It wasn't _me_ in there, filing away in the dark!\"\n\nBeryl looked down her nose at him as if he were a Mizarian asking where\nhe could have his chlorine tank refilled.\n\n\"Is that the story you're telling around?\" she demanded icily.\n\n\"I'm not telling--\" Westervelt realized he was beginning to yell, and\nlowered his voice. \"I'm not telling any story around. Nobody knows\nanything about it except you and I and Pete. Bob couldn't have seen\nanything.\"\n\nBeryl shrugged, a small, disdainful gesture. Westervelt wondered why he\nhad allowed himself to get into an argument over the matter, since it\nwas obvious that he was making things worse with every word.\n\n\"I don't know why you should be so sore about it,\" he said. \"Even Pete\nsaid to me I should forget about it.\"\n\n\"Oh, you two have been talking it over!\" Beryl accused. \"Pretty clubby!\nDo you take over for him on other things too?\"\n\nWestervelt threw up his hands.\n\n\"You don't seem to mind anything about it except that I should know you\nwere in there with him,\" he retorted. \"If he was so acceptable, why am\nI a disease? Nobody ever left this office on account of me!\"\n\n\"It could happen yet,\" said Beryl.\n\n\"Oh, hell! The trouble with you is you need a little loosening up.\"\n\nHe grabbed her by the shoulders and yanked her toward him. Slipping his\nleft arm behind her back as she tried to kick his ankle, he kissed her.\nThe result was spoiled by Beryl's turning her face away at the crucial\ninstant. Westervelt drew back.\n\nThe next thing he knew, lights exploded before his right eye. He had\nnot even seen her hand come up, or he would have ducked. He saw it as\nhe stepped back, however. Despite a certain feminine delicacy, the hand\nclenched into a very capable little fist.\n\nBeryl took one quick stride into the library.\n\n\"I don't like to keep hinting around,\" she said, \"but maybe that will\nplay itself back in your little mind.\"\n\nShe slammed the door three inches from his nose. Westervelt raised a\nhand to open it, then changed his mind and felt gingerly of his eye. It\nhurt, but with a sort of surrounding numbness.\n\nRealizing that he could see after all, he looked up and down the\ncorridor guiltily. It seemed very quiet.\n\n_Right square in the peeper!_ he thought ruefully. _She couldn't have\naimed that well: it must have been a lucky shot. I ought to go in there\nand belt her!_\n\nIt was not something he really wanted to do. He could not foresee any\npleasure or satisfaction in carrying matters to the extent of open war.\n\n_You lost again, Willie_, he argued. _You might as well take it like a\nman. She got annoyed at something you said, like as not, and it was too\nlate when you began._\n\nHe prodded gently at his eye again, and decided that the numb sensation\nwas being caused by the tightening of skin over a growing mouse.\n\nHe set off up the corridor, passed the main door with his face averted,\nand hurried down to the washroom before someone should come along.\n\nSpying out the land through a cautiously opened door, he discovered\nthe place unoccupied. In the mirror, the eye showed definite signs of\nblossoming. The eyebrow was all right, but the orb itself was bloodshot\nand tearing freely. Beneath it, the flesh above the cheekbone was pink\nand puffy.\n\n\"Ohmigod!\" breathed Westervelt. \"It'll be blue tomorrow! Probably\npurple and green, in fact. Or does it take a day or two to reach that\nstage?\"\n\nHe ran cold water into a basin and splashed it over his face, holding a\npalmful at a time against the damaged eye.\n\nWhen this did not seem sufficiently effective, he wadded a soft paper\ntowel, soaked it in running water, and applied it until it lost its\nchill.\n\n\"Am I doing right?\" he wondered. \"I can never remember whether it's hot\nor cold you're supposed to use.\"\n\nHe thought about it while holding the slowly disintegrating towel to\nhis eye. Someone had told him, as nearly as he could recall, that\neither way helped, depending upon when heat or cold was applied.\n\n\"I guess it must be that you use cold before it has time to swell,\"\nhe muttered. \"Keep the blood from going into the tissues--that must\nbe it. But if you're too late for that, then heat would keep it from\nstiffening. Now, the question is, did I start in time?\"\n\nHe examined the eye. It did not feel too sore, but it was still red and\nslightly swollen. The flow of tears had stopped, so he decided there\nwas little more he could do. He dried his face and walked out into the\ncorridor, blinking.\n\n_The com room is pretty dim_, he thought.\n\nHe went to the laboratory door and opened it quietly. The room was dark\nand unoccupied. Westervelt swore to himself that if he stumbled over\nanyone this time, he would punch every nose he could reach without\nfurther ado. Unless, he amended the intention, he ran into Lydman.\n\nHe was squeamish about turning on a light, which left him the problem\nof groping his way through the maze of tables, workbenches, and stacks\nof cartons. He set down for future conversation the possibility of\nclaiming that the department was as normal as any other business; it\ntoo possessed the typical, messy back room out of range of the front\noffice.\n\nHe had negotiated about half the course when he felt a cool breeze.\nAt first, he thought it must come from an air-conditioning diffuser,\nbut it blew more horizontally. Someone must have opened a window, he\ndecided, or perhaps broken one trying out a dangerous instrument.\n\nHe succeeded in reaching the far wall, where he felt around for the\ndoor leading to the communications room. This was over near the outside\nwall, but he reached it without bumping into more than two or three\nscattered objects.\n\nOnce through the door, he could see better because a little light was\ndiffused past the wire-mesh enclosure around the power equipment. He\nwalked along the short passage formed by this, turned a corner, and\ncame in sight of Joe Rosenkrantz sitting before his screen.\n\n\"Hello, Joe,\" he greeted the operator.\n\nThe other jumped perceptibly, looking around at the door.\n\n\"It's Willie,\" said Westervelt. \"I came around the other way.\"\n\nHe was pleased to find that Rosenkrantz had the room as dimly lighted\nas was customary among the TV men. Joe stared for a moment at him and\nWestervelt feared that the other's vision was too well adjusted to the\nlight.\n\n\"I didn't think anybody but Lydman used that way much,\" said\nRosenkrantz.\n\n\"It's a short-cut,\" said Westervelt evasively.\n\nHe found a spare chair to sit in and inquired as to what might be new.\n\nRosenkrantz told him of putting through a few calls to planets near\nTrident, asking D.I.R. men stationed on them to line up spaceships for\npossible use, either to go after Harris or to ship necessary equipment\nfor plumbing the ocean. He offered to let Westervelt scan the tapes of\nhis traffic.\n\n\"That's a good idea,\" said the youth gratefully. \"Even if I don't spot\nan opening, it will look like useful effort.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed the other. \"Time drags, doesn't it. Wonder how they're\nmaking out down in the cable tunnels?\"\n\n\"It can't last much longer.\"\n\n\"That's what this here Harris is saying too, I should think. Now,\n_there's_ one guy who is really packed away!\"\n\n\"Well....\"\n\n\"Oh, they've pulled some good ones around here, but I have a feeling\nabout this one,\" insisted the operator. \"I'd bet ten to one they won't\nspring Harris.\"\n\nWestervelt took the tapes to a playback screen and dragged his chair\nover.\n\n\"I told Smitty they ought to offer to swap for him,\" he said. \"At the\ntime, I meant it looked like the perfect way to unload undesirables.\nCome to think of it, though, I wouldn't mind going myself.\"\n\n\"What the hell for?\" asked Rosenkrantz.\n\nWestervelt realized that he had nearly given himself away.\n\n\"Oh ... just for the chance to see the place,\" he said. \"Nobody else\nhas ever seen these Tridentians. How else could somebody like me get a\nposition as an interstellar ambassador.\"\n\n\"Maybe Harris wants the job for himself. He sure went looking for it!\"\n\nThe phone buzzed quietly. Rosenkrantz answered, then said, \"It's for\nyou.\"\n\nWestervelt went to the screen. It was Smith.\n\n\"I thought you must have found a way out, Willie. Where did you get to?\"\n\nWestervelt explained that he was looking at the tapes of the Trident\ncalls, to familiarize himself with the background.\n\n\"I figured there was plenty of time for me to--\" He broke off as he\nsaw Rosenkrantz straighten up to focus in a call from space. \"Joe is\nreceiving something right now. I'll let you know if it has anything to\ndo with Trident.\"\n\n\"Department 99, Terra,\" the operator was saying when Westervelt turned\nfrom the phone, as if the mere call signal had not satisfied the party\nat the other end.\n\nThere seemed to be a lot of action on the screen. Men were running\nin various directions in what appeared to be a large hall with an\nimpressive stairway.\n\n\"Yoleen!\" Rosenkrantz flung over his shoulder. \"Tell Smitty!\"\n\n\"Mr. Smith!\" said Westervelt, turning back to the phone screen. \"Joe\nsays it's Yoleen coming in. Maybe you'd like to see it yourself.\nSomething looks wrong.\"\n\n\"Coming!\" said Smith, and the phone went dark.\n\nWestervelt looked around to see that most of the running figures had\nhidden themselves. A voice was coming over, and he listened with the\noperator.\n\n\"... knocked apart so I have to use one of the observation lenses they\nhave planted around the embassy. He's shooting up the place good!\"\n\n\"I'm taping until someone gets here,\" said Rosenkrantz. \"Better tell me\nwhat happened, just in case.\"\n\n_Yoleen_, thought Westervelt. _That would be ... let me see ... Gerson,\nthe kidnap case. Do they mean that he's shooting them up?_\n\n\"... and after he left me with this mess, in the com room, he headed\nfor the stairs,\" said the voice of the unseen operator. \"He seems to be\ntrying to get out of the embassy. We don't know why--the boys got him\nthere without any trouble.\"\n\n\"Was he all right?\" asked Rosenkrantz, cocking an ear at the door.\n\n\"He looked pretty sick, as if he wasn't eating well, and he had a\nbroken wrist. They took him along to the doctor with no trouble. Then\nthe chief went up to see how he was and found Doc out cold on the\nfloor. He set up a yell, naturally. Someone finally caught up with\nGerson in the military attache's office.\"\n\n\"What did he want there?\" asked Rosenkrantz.\n\n\"We don't know yet. He left a corpse for us that isn't answering\nquestions.\"\n\n\n\n\nFIFTEEN\n\n\nIn the building to which the two terrans had brought him, Gerson\ncrouched behind the ornate balustrade edging the mezzanine. He was near\nthe head of the stairway and hoped to get nearer.\n\nA look down the hall behind him showed no unwary heads in view. He\nstudied the sections of the hall below, which he could see through the\nopenings in the railing. There had been a great scrambling about down\nthere a moment earlier, so he was uneasy about showing himself.\n\nHe had armed himself as chance provided: a rocket pistol of Yoleenite\nmanufacture--doubtless purchased as a souvenir--and a sharp knife from\na dinner tray he had come upon in one of the rooms he had searched.\nBecause of his injury, he had to grip the knife between his teeth.\nSomething bothered him about this arrangement. He had the papers thrust\nin his shirt, he held the rocket pistol in one hand, one hand was\nhurt--yet the only way left to hold the knife was in his teeth. It did\nnot seem exactly right, but he had had no time to ponder. The Terrans\nwere keeping him busy.\n\nSince he had been brought to this building, he had seen four threes of\nTerrans. One, the medical worker, he had rendered helpless. Then he had\ngone to search for secrets, and that other one had seen him. By that\ntime, he had found the rocket pistol. He had left that Terran dead, but\nothers had come running.\n\nSomething had told him to shoot up the communications equipment,\nalthough the Terran working it had escaped. He was somewhere behind\nGerson, behind one of the many doors leading off that high, bright\ncorridor.\n\nHe believed that he had seen one other duck into a doorway ahead of\nhim, along the hall on the other side of the mezzanine. There was yet\nanother hiding behind the opposite balustrade. Gerson wondered idly if\nthe last one was armed.\n\nHe tried to review the probable positions of those on the main floor.\nOne had definitely run out the front door, which faced the bottom\nof the broad stairway, about thirty feet away. There was a shallow\nanteroom there, but Gerson had seen him all the way across it.\n\nOf the others, one had ducked into a chamber at the front of the main\nhall, to Gerson's left as he would be descending the stairs. Another\nhad run back under cover of the stairway on the same side, and the\nremaining four were lurking somewhere to the right, either behind the\nstairs or in adjoining chambers.\n\nHe leaned closer to the balustrade in an effort to see more. In the\nact, his injured limb came in contact with the barrier and made him\ngrimace in pain. The drug the Terran medical worker had shot into it\nwas wearing off.\n\nSince he had made a slight noise already, Gerson crawled along about\nten feet until he was just beside the head of the stairs. He made\nhimself quiet to listen.\n\nSomewhere below, two of the embassy staff were talking cautiously. It\nmight be a good time to catch them unawares. He rose and took a step\ntoward the stairs.\n\nA voice that sounded artificially loud spoke in one or another of the\nlower chambers. It had a slight echo, making it nearly impossible for\nGerson to determine the direction. The Terran who had ducked into the\nroom on the left appeared, raising a weapon of some kind.\n\nGerson blazed a rocket in his direction. The slim missile, the length\nand thickness of the two top joints of his thumb, left a smoky trail\njust above the stairway railing and blew a large hole in the wall\nbeside the doorway where the staff man had been standing. Somehow, the\nfellow had leaped back in time to avoid the flying specks of metal and\nplaster.\n\nGerson knelt behind the balustrade again, shaken by the sense of new\npain, and wondering at its source. He concentrated. After a moment, he\nfelt the wetness trickling dawn his left side. Some small object had\ngrazed the flesh; and he realized that it must have been a solid pellet\nprojected by the weapon of the Terran at whom he had shot.\n\nHe knew that the Terrans had more dangerous weapons than that, but\nhad been confident that they would dare nothing over-violent here\nwithin their own building. The pistol used against him must be an\nold-fashioned one or a keepsake. Possibly it was a mock weapon built\nfor practicing at a target. He seemed to remember vaguely having\nhandled such a thing in the past.\n\nHe strained after the fleeting memory, clenching his teeth with the\neffort, but it was gone. So many memories seemed to be gone. All he was\nsure of was that he must get out of here with those papers.\n\nHe checked the upper hall again, before and behind. He looked\nacross the open space for the Terran hiding like himself behind the\nbalustrade, but could not find him. It might or might not be worthwhile\nto send a shot over there at random. If he missed, he might at least\nscare the fellow.\n\nThe loud voice with the mechanical sound to it blared out from below.\n\n\"Gerson!\" it called. \"Gerson, throw down your weapon and stand up. We\ncan see where you are. We want to help you.\"\n\nGerson showed no reaction. Analyzing the statement, he reminded himself\nthat one Terran had shot him. Not very seriously, it was true, but\nit was not in the nature of help. Either the voice lied or it had no\ncontrol over the individual who had fired at him.\n\nHe did not blame it for the presumable untruth, since he was not\ndeceived by it. It would be preferrable to kill the man who had shot\nhim, but he must bear in mind that his main task was to get out of the\nbuilding.\n\n\"Gerson!\" called the voice again. \"We know you are injured. You are a\nsick man. We beg you to drop your weapon and let us help you!\"\n\nGerson wondered what the voice meant by the expression \"sick.\"\n\nIt was possible that someone had seen him wounded by the last shot. Or\ndid they mean his sore limb. It occurred to him then that the blood\nthat had run out and dried on the right side of his face must be\nclearly visible. The Terran he had killed back along the corridor had\nflung a small ceramic dish at him, and Gerson had been slow in raising\nhis injured limb to block it. The whole side of his face was sore, but\nthe skin of his cheek no longer bled so it was a matter of opinion\nwhether he was sick on that account.\n\nThe voice must mean the last wound, when it called him sick. That meant\nthat the Terran he had shot at was the voice or that there was another\nTerran in the room with him. Gerson did not think that any of the\nothers could have seen. Some doubt at the back of his mind struggled to\nsuggest an oversight, but he knew of none.\n\nHe peered once more between the balusters, and this time he saw a\nmotion, a mere shadow, across the way. Instantly, he stood up and\nlaunched a rocket at the spot. It streaked on its way and exploded\nimmediately against one of the uprights. Gerson regretted fleetingly\nthat it had not gone through and struck against the wall beyond,\nwhich would have accounted for the skulking Terran with a good deal\nof certainty. As the baluster disintegrated, leaving stubs at top and\nbottom, Gerson started down the stairs.\n\nYells sounded from below. He threw one leg up to mount the stair\nrailing, leaned back along it, and let himself slide. The rocket\npistol, waving wildly at arm's length in his left hand, helped him to\nbalance. He reached the landing at the middle of the stairs in one\nswoop.\n\nThe human at whom he had shot reappeared in the same doorway. Gerson\nrolled to his left, felt both feet hit upon the landing, and let go\nanother missile. It was too late; the Terran had not even lingered to\nfire back. It seemed almost like a feint to distract.\n\n\"_Gerson!_\" blared the mechanical voice.\n\n\"Gerson! Gerson!\" shouted other voices.\n\nThey came from many directions, and he was unable to comprehend them\nall. He had reached a point near the bottom of the stairway, running\nthree steps at a time, when a louder yell directed his attention to\nthe doorway on his right. The figure of a Terran showed there.\n\nWithout breaking his stride, he whipped his left hand across his body\nand fired a rocket. He had a glimpse of the figure dodging aside before\nthe smoke and dust of the explosion told him he had nicked the edge of\nthe doorway.\n\nIt seemed to him that he must have shot the Terran as well, and he let\nhis eye linger there an instant as he reached the floor of the hall.\nThus, he saw the figure reappear and was in position to fling two more\nshots with animal quickness.\n\nThe figure was blown straight backward this time, but Gerson had time\nto realize that there had been no head on it when it had been thrust\nout.\n\nHis first shot must have done that. All told, he had wasted three\nmissiles on a dummy.\n\nThen the loop of rope fell about him, and he knew why he had been lured\ninto facing this direction. He tried to bring the rocket pistol to\nbear on the three Terrans running at him from behind the stairway. The\nfourth, at the end of the rope, heaved Gerson off his feet.\n\nHe crashed down upon his sore limb, letting out a groan at the impact.\nOne of the runners dove headlong at him, batting at the pistol as he\nslid past on the polished floor. Gerson felt the weapon knocked out of\nhis grasp. It rattled and scraped along the floor out of reach, but he\nkicked the one who had done it in the head.\n\nTwo of the Terrans were trying to hold him down, now. He got the knife\nfrom his mouth into his left hand, let a Terran see it, then bit him\nviciously on the wrist. The Terran let go, and Gerson found it simple\nto knee the remaining one in the groin. He rolled over to get a knee\nunder him, pushed himself up with the fist gripping the knife, and saw\nTerrans running at him from all directions.\n\nOne of them had a broad, white bandage on his head. Gerson recognized\nhim as the medical worker. The man carried a hypodermic syringe.\n\nUnreasoning terror swept through Gerson. He knew that he must, at all\ncosts, avoid that needle.\n\nHe whirled around to slash at the men coming up behind him. The nearest\nfell back warily.\n\n\"Put it away, Gerson,\" he said. \"We don't want to hurt you, man! Why,\nyou're half dead on your feet.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked another, more softly. \"We can see that\nyou're not normal. What did those bastards do to you?\"\n\nGerson looked from side to side, seeing them closing in but unable to\nspot an opening for a charge.\n\n\"Just listen to me a minute,\" said the medical worker. He made the\nmistake of holding the hypodermic out of sight this time, too late.\n\"Gerson, talk to me! Say something! Whatever the trouble is, we'll help\nyou.\"\n\nIt was the only opening.\n\nGerson took a carefully hesitant step toward him, then another. He held\nup his damaged limb.\n\n\"Yes, your wrist is broken,\" said the Terran. \"I was going to put a\ncast on it for you, remember. Now, just relax, and we'll take care of--\"\n\nHe saw Gerson's eyes and leaped back.\n\nThe knife swept up in a vicious arc that would have disemboweled him.\n\nWithout wasting the motion, Gerson slashed down and left at another\nas he plunged forward. The point grazed an up-flung arm, drawing a\nstartled curse from the victim.\n\n\"Tackle him!\" shouted one of the Terrans.\n\n\"Careful! He's already hurt bad enough,\" cautioned another.\n\nGerson tried to feint and throw his weight in the opposite direction,\nbut his legs would not obey him. He recovered from the slip only to\nhave one of the men push him from behind.\n\nSomeone clamped a tight hold on his left forearm as he staggered. A\nmoment later they twisted the knife out of his grasp and bore him to\nthe floor. He kicked ineffectively and then caught one of them by\nsurprise with a butt.\n\nThe man recoiled, blood spurting already from his nose. He brought his\nfist around despite warning yells, and clipped Gerson on the temple.\n\n\"Hold him, dammit!\" shouted someone. \"Get that rope over here. Do you\nwant to kill him? Just hold him still.\"\n\n\"You try it,\" invited one of those holding Gerson pinned.\n\n\"I think he's weakening,\" said another. \"Watch out--he may be playing\npossum.\"\n\nThe talk seemed to come from far away. Gerson felt them tie his ankles\ntogether. They hesitated about his hands; one was injured. One voice\nsuggested tieing his left wrist to the stairway railing, but it was\ndecided that they could watch him well enough as long as he could not\nrun. The weight lessened as those pinning him arose to look to their\nown bruises. Gerson was vaguely surprised to discover that all of them\nwere off him. He still felt as if great weight were holding him pressed\nagainst the floor. He found it difficult to catch his breath.\n\nThey had taken the papers from his shirt, he noted. One of the Terrans\npassed them to a man in a dark uniform, who began to leaf through them\nworriedly.\n\nA Terran came in through the front door.\n\n\"Have you got him?\" the newcomer asked. \"That helicopter is still\nfloating around up there. I've been watching it for half an hour with\nthe night glasses. They sure as hell are waiting for something.\"\n\n\"And there isn't anyone else in this neighborhood they could be\ninterested in,\" said a deeper voice. \"Well, MacLean, what did you let\nhim get his hands on from your secret file?\"\n\nGerson rolled over very quietly and started to drag himself along the\nfloor. He had actually moved a yard before they noticed him.\n\nThey were gentle about turning him on his back again. The discussion\nabout the papers was dropped while the medical worker cut his shirt\naway from the bleeding wound in his side. Hushed comments were made,\nbut Gerson paid no attention. He was concerned with the fact that one\nof the Terrans had planted a foot between his legs, above the rope\naround his ankles, so that he was quite securely anchored to the spot.\n\n\"Looks like a broken rib besides,\" said the Terran examining him. \"Do\nyou think we could get him upstairs?\"\n\n\"I'm no doctor,\" said the deeper voice, \"but even I can see you'd never\nmake it in time.\"\n\nThe voice came closer, though the vision in Gerson's eyes was blurring.\n\n\"Tell me, boy, what happened? How did they make you do it? What do they\nwant?\"\n\n\"Gerson!\" said the man in the dark uniform. \"Did you know what you were\nafter when you took these papers?\"\n\nHe was a dark blur to Gerson, who felt as if the weight on his chest\nhad been increased. His lips were dry. He thought it would be nice to\nhave a little water, but could not find words to ask.\n\nThe deep voice was flinging a question at the dark blur.\n\n\"Why, no, sir,\" said the Terran with the papers. \"Nothing important at\nall. Just a few old shipping lists, a record of the planetary motions\nin this system that anybody could obtain, and an article on shortcuts\nto learning the Yoleenite language. I think I had the batch lying\naround the top of my desk.\"\n\n\"Why did he take them?\" someone asked.\n\n\"Damned if I know. You fellows had me scared to death. From what you\nsaid, I thought he must have pinched the deadly top secret code and my\npersonal address book to boot!\"\n\n\"Simmons!\" shouted the deeper voice. \"Are you getting this? Are you\nmaking a tape for Terra? Oh ... right out, eh? Scrambled, I hope--it's\nnot the kind of thing to publicize to the galaxy.\"\n\nThe mechanical voice boomed in the background. Gerson paid it no\nattention.\n\nHe felt the doctor's hands touching the old injections and heard the\nman swearing. Whoever was holding his left arm was actually squeezing\nand stroking his hand. The taste of failure was in his mouth.\n\n\"That's what they must have started with,\" said the doctor. \"In the\nend, they put an awful mental twist into him, poor guy.\"\n\n\"I told you they were up to something,\" said the dark blur. \"Those\nlittle bastards had big ideas, but they won't catch us napping with any\nmore spies, conditioned or not! Now maybe they'll read my reports on\nTerra.\"\n\nGerson opened his mouth to breath better. He rolled his head from side\nto side on the hard floor. Somewhere deep inside him, a little, silent\nvoice was crying, frightened. He had failed and there would be no other\nchance.\n\nThe little voice took leave of its fear to laugh. _They_ had not let\nhim remember how to read.\n\nAnd so he died, a tall, battered Terran lying on a hard floor and\ngrinning faintly up at the men who had helped him die.\n\n\n\n\nSIXTEEN\n\n\nIn the communications room of department 99, Westervelt could actually\nhear people around him breathing, so hushed was the gathering. Someone\nwas leaning on his shoulder, but he was reluctant to attract attention\nby moving.\n\nStatic sounds and the clicking and humming of various mechanisms about\nthe room suddenly became unnaturally noticable. Glancing this way and\nthat, he discovered that the entire staff had drifted in during the\ntransmission from Yoleen. There were at least two people behind him, to\njudge by the breathing and the weight on his shoulder. So intense had\nbeen the excitement that he did not remember anyone but Smith arriving.\n\nHe saw better to the left than to the right, and became conscious of\nhis eye again. Westervelt had drawn up his chair behind and to the\nleft of the operator, and Smith had perched himself on the end of a\ntable behind Joe. Beside the chief stood Simonetta, with Beryl behind\nher. Parrish was to Westervelt's left, so he concluded that Lydman\nand Pauline must be behind him. The grip on his right shoulder felt\nsmall to be Lydman's, but he could not see down at the necessary angle\nbecause of the puffiness under his eye.\n\nThe broad-shouldered, stocky man on the screen moved to the stairway\nand looked up straight into their eyes.\n\n\"Is this still going out to Terra, Simmons?\" he asked.\n\nHe had dark hair with a crinkly wave in it, which permitted him to\nappear less disheveled than the men about him or standing over the\nbody of Gerson. He pulled out a large white handkerchief to wipe the\nstreaming perspiration from his face.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered the voice of the distant operator. \"You're looking\nright into the concealed pick-up. I'll switch the audio from Terra to\nthe loud speaker system, and you can talk to them.\"\n\nWestervelt glanced at the other men in the embassy on Yoleen. Several\nof them obviously suffered from minor injuries. All of them wore\nexpressions of tragedy.\n\nOne man in his shirtsleeves was standing with his shoulders against\nthe base of the stairway, head thrown well back, trying to staunch the\nflow of blood from his nose. Another, with his back to the lens, knelt\nbeside the body of Gerson. A couple of others, looking helpless, were\nlighting cigarettes.\n\n\"I suppose you saw the end of it,\" the man on the stairs said.\n\nSmith cleared his throat and leaned over Joe Rosenkrantz's shoulder.\n\n\"We saw,\" he answered. \"I ... is there any doubt that he's dead?\"\n\nThe man on the stairs looked to the group around the body. The doctor\nshook his bandaged head sadly.\n\n\"As much from strain and exhaustion as anything else,\" he reported.\n\"The man belonged in a hospital, but some uncanny conditioning drove\nhim on. In the end, his heart gave out.\"\n\nThe stocky man turned back to the lens.\n\n\"You heard that. Except for one man who didn't know at the time what\nwas going on, we did the best we could. I'm Delaney, by the way, in\ncharge here.\"\n\nSmith identified himself, and agreed that Gerson had looked to be\nunmanageable.\n\n\"Do you think you can find out what they used?\" he asked. \"I gather\nthat you never got anything out of him since the time you picked him\nup. Did that part of it go according to plan?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Delaney. \"We even got back the little torch we sent\nhim, the way you plotted for us. It looked used, too; but now I'm\nwondering if they let him cut his way out.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't doubt it,\" said Smith gloomily. \"I'm afraid we didn't look\nvery bright on this one. We seem to have underestimated the Yoleenites\nbadly. There isn't too much information on them available here.\"\n\n\"Nor here, to tell the truth,\" said Delaney. \"Which reminds me--our\nCaptain MacLean has been after me for a long time to put more pressure\non the D.I.R. about that. Could you duplicate your tape and send them a\ncopy? It would save us another transmission, and you might like to add\nyour own comments.\"\n\nSmith promised to have it done. He also offered, to soothe Captain\nMacLean, to send an extra copy to the Space Force.\n\nThere seemed to be nothing more to say. The scene on the screen blanked\nout, as the distant operator spoke to Rosenkrantz on audio only from\nhis own shot-up office. Then it was over.\n\nWestervelt, aware that the pressure on his shoulder was gone, looked\naround. Lydman had his arm about a shaken Pauline. The ex-spacer's\nexpression was blank, but the hardness of his eyes made the youth\nshiver. For a second, he thought he detected a slight resemblance\nto the man who had come bounding down the stairs on Yoleen, leaving\ncriss-cross trails of rocket smoke in the air.\n\n_That's crazy!_ he thought the next instant, and he lost the\nresemblance.\n\nHe blinked, fingered his tender eye, and looked around at the others.\nEveryone was subdued, staring at the blank and quiet receiver or at\nthe floor. Westervelt was surprised to see that Beryl was crying. She\nraised a forefinger to scrub the tears from her cheek.\n\nHesitantly, Westervelt took the neatly folded handkerchief from his\nbreast pocket and held it out.\n\nBeryl scrubbed the other cheek, looked at the handkerchief without\nraising her eyes to his, and accepted it. She blotted her eyes,\nexamined the cloth, and whispered, \"Sorry, Willie. I think I got\nmake-up on it.\"\n\nSmith stirred uncomfortably at the whisper. He stood up and spoke one\nshort word with a depth of emotion. Then he kicked the leg of the table\nto relieve his feelings.\n\nRosenkrantz swiveled around in his chair, waiting to see if any other\ncalls were to be made. Smith took a deep breath.\n\n\"You'll make copies of the tape when you can, Joe?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said the operator, sympathetically.\n\n\"Well,\" said Lydman, at the rear of the group, \"that's another one\nlost. Tomorrow we'll open a permanent file on Yoleen, as Pete suggests.\"\n\n\"Yes, I imagine they'll give us more business,\" agreed Parrish.\n\nLydman growled.\n\n\"I'll give _them_ the business next time!\" he threatened. \"Well, that\nkind of damps the pile for tonight. I don't know about the rest of you,\nbut I'm in no mood now to be clever.\"\n\nSmith straightened up abruptly.\n\n\"Now ... now ... wait a minute!\" he spluttered. \"I mean, we all feel\npretty low, naturally. Still, this wasn't the main ... serious as this\nwas, we were trying to push on this other case, to get a start anyway.\"\n\n_Here we go again,_ thought Westervelt. _Shall I try to trip him up if\nanything happens, or shall I just get out of the way?_\n\nHe recalled the man in the embassy on Yoleen, holding a stained\nhandkerchief to his bloody nose, and measured the size of his own with\nthe tip of a forefinger. On the other hand, if there should be a melee,\nit would certainly cover a little item like a puffy eye. He wondered if\nhe would have the guts to poke out his head at the proper instant, and\nwas rather afraid that he would.\n\nParrish was murmuring about sticking to the job in hand, trying to\nsupport Smith without arousing the antagonism of an open argument.\nLydman seemed unconvinced.\n\n\"Why don't we all have a round of coffee?\" suggested Simonetta. \"If we\ncan just sit down a few minutes and pull ourselves together--\"\n\nSmith looked at her gratefully.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"That's the least we can do, Bob. This was a shock to\nus all, but the girls felt it more. I don't believe any of them wants\nto hit the street all shaken up like this. Right Si?\"\n\n\"I _would_ like to sit down somewhere,\" said Simonetta.\n\n\"Here!\" exclaimed Westervelt, leaping up. He had forgotten that he had\nbeen rooted to the chair since before the others had crept into the\nroom during the transmission from Yoleen.\n\n\"Never mind, Willie,\" Simonetta said. \"I didn't mean I was collapsing.\nCome on, Beryl, let's see if there's any coffee or tea left.\"\n\n\"Wait for me,\" said Pauline. \"I've got to take this phone off the\noutside line anyway.\"\n\nSmith stepped forward to plant one hand behind Lydman's shoulder blade.\n\n\"I could use a martini, myself,\" he called after the girls. \"How about\nthe rest of you? Pete? Willie?\"\n\nParrish seconded the motion, Westervelt said he would be right along,\nand trailed them slowly to the door. He paused to look back, and he and\nJoe exchanged brow-mopping gestures.\n\nThe rest of them were trouping along the corridor without much talk.\nHe ambled along until the men, bringing up the rear, had turned the\ncorner. Then he ducked into the library.\n\nHe fingered his eye again. Either it was a trifle less sore or he was\ngetting used to it. He still hesitated to face an office full of people\nand good lighting.\n\n\"There must be something around here to read,\" he muttered.\n\nHe walked over to a stack of current magazines. Most of them were\ntechnical in nature; but several dealt with world and galactic news. He\ntook a few to a seat at the long table and began to leaf through one.\n\nIt must have been about fifteen minutes later that Simonetta showed up,\nbearing a sealed cup of tea and one of coffee.\n\n\"So that's where you are!\" she said. \"I was taking something to Joe,\nand thought maybe I'd find you along the way.\"\n\nWestervelt deduced that she had phoned the operator.\n\n\"You can have the coffee,\" she said, setting it beside his magazine.\n\"Joe said he'd rather have tea this time around.\"\n\nWestervelt looked up. Simonetta saw his eye and pursed her lips.\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"How does it look?\" asked Westervelt glumly.\n\n\"Kind of pretty. If I remember the ones my brothers used to bring home,\nit will be ravishingly beautiful by tomorrow!\"\n\n\"That's what I was afraid of,\" said Westervelt.\n\nSimonetta laughed. She set the tea aside and pulled out a chair.\n\n\"I don't think it's really that bad, Willie,\" she told him. \"I was only\nfooling.\"\n\n\"It shows though, huh?\"\n\n\"Oh ... yes ... it shows.\"\n\n\"That's what I like about you, Si,\" said Westervelt. \"You don't ask\nnasty, embarrassing questions like how it happened or which door closed\non me.\"\n\nFollowing which he told her nearly the whole story, leaving out only\nthe true origin of the quarrel. He suspected that Simonetta could put\ntwo and two together, but he meant to tell nobody about the start of it.\n\n\"Ah, Willie,\" she said with a grin at the conclusion, \"if you had to\nfall for a blonde, why couldn't you pick little Pauline?\"\n\n\"I guess you're right.\"\n\n\"Now, don't take _that_ so seriously too! Beryl's a good sort, on the\nwhole. In a day or two, this will all blow over. Come on with me to see\nJoe, then we'll go back and say you got something in your eye.\"\n\n\"But when?\"\n\n\"Oh ... during the message from Yoleen. You didn't want to bother\nanybody at the time, so you foolishly kept rubbing until it got sore.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Westervelt, \"but Beryl knows different.\"\n\n\"If she opens her mouth, I shall personally punch _her_ in the eye!\"\ndeclared Simonetta.\n\nShe giggled at the idea, and he found himself grinning.\n\nThey went along the corridor to deliver the tea to Rosenkrantz, and\nthen returned to the main office. An air of complete informality\nprevailed, a reaction from the scene they had witnessed. There was\na good deal of wandering about with drinks, sitting on desks, and\ninconsequential chatter.\n\nNo one seemed to want to talk shop, and Westervelt guessed that Smith\nwas just as pleased to be able to kill some time. He himself quietly\nslipped around the corner to his own desk, where he propped his heels\nup and sipped his coffee.\n\nWestervelt listened as Parrish and Smith told a few jokes. The stories\ntended to be more ironic than funny, and no one was expected to laugh\nout loud.\n\nPauline, from her switchboard, buzzed the phone on Simonetta's desk,\nsince most of those present had gravitated to that end of the office.\nSmith looked around in the middle of an account of his struggles with\nhis radio-controlled lawn mower.\n\n\"Want to take that, Willie?\" he said, with a bare suggestion of a wink.\n\nWestervelt lifted a hand in assent. He climbed out of his chair and\nwent to the phone on Beryl's desk, where he would be as nearly private\nas possible.\n\n\"Who is it, Pauline?\" he asked when she came on.\n\n\"It's Joe. He wants to talk to Mr. Smith.\"\n\n\"Give it here on number seven,\" said Westervelt. \"The boss is talking.\"\n\nPauline blanked out and was replaced by the communications man.\nRosenkrantz showed a flicker of surprise at the sight of Westervelt.\n\n\"Smitty's in a crowd,\" murmured the youth. \"Something up?\"\n\n\"Not much, maybe,\" said the other. \"A message came in by commercial\nTV. I guess they didn't think it was too urgent, but I'll give you the\nfacts if you think Smitty would like to know.\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" said Westervelt. \"Let's see ... where does Beryl keep a pen?\"\n\nHe dug out a scratch pad and something to scribble with, and nodded.\n\n\"One of our own agents,\" said Joe, \"named Robertson, signed this.\nYou've seen his reports, I guess.\"\n\n\"Yeah, sounds familiar.\"\n\n\"It says, after reading between our standard code expressions, that two\nspacers and a tourist were convicted of inciting revolution on Epsilon\nIndi II. They gave the names, and all, which I taped.\"\n\n\"That's practically in our back yard,\" said Westervelt. \"Maybe he just\nwants to alert us, but the D.I.R. ought to be working on that publicly.\nSure there wasn't any hint it was urgent?\"\n\n\"No, and like I said, it came by commercial relay.\"\n\n\"Okay. The boss has enough on his mind at the moment. Let's figure on\nhaving a tape for him to look at in the morning. I'll find a chance to\nmention it to him, so he'll know about it. All right?\"\n\n\"All right with me,\" grinned Rosenkrantz. \"If anything goes wrong, I'll\nrefer them to you. Be prepared to have your other eye spit in.\"\n\nHe cut off, leaving Westervelt with his mouth open and his regained\naplomb shaky. The youth waited until he caught Smith's eye, and shook\nhis head to indicate the unimportance of the call. He wondered if he\nought to take time to phone downstairs for a report on the situation.\nIt did not strike him as worth the risk with all the people in the same\nroom.\n\nHe saw Beryl strolling his way and rose from her chair.\n\n\"That's all right, Willie,\" she said calmly, setting her packaged drink\non the desk. \"I just wanted to give you back your handkerchief.\"\n\nShe produced it from the purse lying on her desk and said, \"Thanks\nagain. I'm sorry about the make-up marks.\"\n\n\"Forget it,\" said Westervelt.\n\n\"I'm sorry about the eye too,\" said Beryl, raising her eyes for the\nfirst time to examine the damage. \"It ... doesn't look as bad as Si\nsaid.\"\n\n\"Well, that's a comfort, anyway. I got something in it and rubbed too\nhard, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, she told me,\" said Beryl. \"To tell the truth, Willie, I didn't\nknow I could do it.\"\n\n\"Aw, it was a lucky swing,\" muttered Westervelt.\n\n\"Yes ... I, well ... you might say I was a little upset.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry I started it all,\" said Westervelt. \"How about letting me\nbuy you a lunch to make up.\"\n\nBeryl shrugged, looking serious.\n\n\"I don't mind, if we make it Dutch. It was as much my fault. I hope\nwe're both around to go to lunch tomorrow. It gives me the creeps.\"\n\n\"What does?\" asked Westervelt.\n\n\"The way Mr. Lydman looks. Something about his eyes....\"\n\nWestervelt turned his head to stare across the room, wondering if the\nworst had occurred.\n\n\n\n\nSEVENTEEN\n\n\nJohn Willard set a brisk pace through the streets of First Haven, as\nbefitted a conscientious public servant. Maria Ringstad kept up with\nhim as best she could. When she lagged, the thin cord tightened around\nher wrist, and he grumbled over his shoulder at her. Naturally, she\ncarried her bag.\n\nHe had explained that they would have been most inconspicuous with her\nwalking properly a yard behind him. Anyone would then have taken them\nfor man and wife or man and servant--had it not been for her Terran\nclothing.\n\n\"To walk the street with you in that rig would attract entirely too\nmuch attention,\" was his explanation. \"The only thing we can do is use\nthe public symbol of restraint, so that everyone will know you are a\nprisoner.\"\n\n\"What good will that do? Won't they still stare.\"\n\n\"It is considered improper, as well as imprudent. No law-abiding\ncitizen would wish to risk being suspected of a sympathetic curiosity\nabout a transgressor.\"\n\n\"You make it sound dangerous,\" said Maria, holding out her hand\nobediently.\n\n_Anything to be inconspicuous_, she had thought.\n\nNow, turning a corner about three hundred yards from the jail, she had\nto admit that the system seemed to be working. The Greenies whom they\nmet were nearly all interested in other things: a shop in the vicinity,\nanother Greenie across the street, a paving stone over which they had\njust tripped, or the condition of the wall above Maria's head.\n\nWillard led her to the far side of a broader avenue after they had\nnegotiated the corner that put them permanently out of sight of the\njail. Maria tried to recall the scanty information he had whispered to\nher against the outside wall of the prison.\n\nThere had been time for him to tell her he was sent by the Department\nof Interstellar Relations of Terra to get her out, since it had proved\nimpossible to alter the attitude of the Greenie legal authorities.\nMaria was not quite sure whether he was really the prison officer he\nsaid he was, in which case he must have been bribed on a scale to make\nher own \"crime\" ridiculous, or whether he was an independent worker\nfriendly to the Terran space line, in which case the payment might more\ncharitably be regarded as a fee.\n\nShe knew that he planned to deliver her to a spaceship due to leave\nshortly. There had been no opportunity for her to ask the destination.\n\n_To tell the truth_, she reflected, _I don't care where it is. Anything\nwould be a haven from Greenhaven!_\n\nShe began to amuse herself by planning the article she would write\nwhen back on Terra. \"How I escaped from Paradise\" might do it. Or\n\"Prison-breaking in Paradise.\" Or perhaps \"Greenhaven or Green Hell.\"\n\n_Whatever I call it_, she promised herself, _I'll skin them alive. And\nI'll find a way to send the judge and the warden copies of it, too!_\n\nMaybe, she pondered, it might even be better to stretch it out to a\nwhole book and get someone to do a series of unflattering cartoons of\nGreenie characters.\n\nThe cord jerked at her wrist. She realized that she had fallen behind\nagain, and made an apologetic face at Willard when he looked back.\n\n\"Don't do that!\" he hissed. \"They'll wonder why I tolerate disrespect.\"\n\n\"Sorry!\" said Maria, shrugging unrepentantly. \"You take this pretty\nseriously, don't you.\"\n\n\"You'd better take it seriously yourself,\" he growled. \"It's your neck\nas much as mine!\"\n\nHe glared at a young Greenie who had glanced curiously from the\nopposite side of the avenue. The abashed citizen hastily averted his\neyes. Willard gave the cord a significant twitch and strode on.\n\nThey turned another corner, to the right this time, and went along a\nnarrow side street for about two hundred yards. Waiting for a moment\nwhen he might meet as few people as possible, Willard crossed to the\nother side. A little further on, he led the way into what could almost\nbe termed an alley.\n\nWillard stopped.\n\n\"Now, we are going into this small food shop,\" he informed Maria. \"You\nwould call it a cafe or restaurant on Terra. It will seem normal enough\nfor an officer to provide his charge with food for a journey, so that\nwill be reasonable.\"\n\n\"Is the food any better than what I've been getting?\" asked Maria.\n\n\"It doesn't matter. We won't stop there, since it would be impolite to\ninflict the sight of you upon honest citizens at their meal. I shall\nrequest a private room, and the keeper will lead us to the rear.\"\n\n\"Humph! Well if that's the way it is, then that's the way it is. So in\nthe eyes of an honest Greenie I'm something to spoil his appetite. What\ncan I do about that?\"\n\n\"What you can do is keep that big, flexible, active mouth of yours\n_shut_!\" declared Willard. \"Otherwise, I shall simply drop the end of\nthe cord and take off. You can find your own way out.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" apologized Maria, a shade too meekly. \"I promise I'll be\noh-so-good. Do you want me to kneel down and lick your boots? Or will\nit be enough if I open a vein in the soup?\"\n\n\"It will be enough if I get out of this without committing murder,\"\nmumbled Willard. \"Now, the expression is fine; just wipe that grin off\nyour mind and well go in!\"\n\nHe pulled her along the few yards to the entrance of the food shop.\n\nHe opened the door and entered. Maria followed at the respectful\ndistance.\n\nThere were half a dozen Greenies eating plain, wholesome meals at\nplain, sturdy tables and exchanging a plain, honest word now and then.\nThe sight of the cord on Maria's wrist counterbalanced the sight of her\nlascivious Terran costume, and they kept their eyes on their food after\none startled glance.\n\nA Greenie woman stood at a counter at one side of the food shop, and\nWillard made known his desire for a private dining room. A man cooking\nsomething that might have been stew looked around from his labor at a\nmassive but primitive stove to the rear of the counter. Maria thought\nthat he took an unusual interest in her compared to what she had been\nobserving recently. It rather helped her morale, and she thought she\ndid not blame the man if the counterwoman were his wife.\n\nThe latter now came from behind her little fortress and led the way to\na door at the rear of the shop. Willard followed, and Maria trailed\nalong, restraining an impulse to wink at the cook. She was conscious of\nhis analytical stare until the door had closed behind her.\n\nWillard seemed to have nothing to say to the Greenie woman, and Maria\nrelented to the point of heeding his request to be silent. All this\nmade for a solemn little procession.\n\nThey walked along a short hall, and the Greenie woman opened another\ndoor to a flight of stairs. What surprised Maria was that the stairs\nled down. She shrugged--on Greenhaven, they had their own peculiar ways.\n\nShe was more puzzled when, at the bottom of the steps, they seemed to\nbe in an ordinary cellar. The light was dim, and she did not succeed in\ncatching the look on Willard's face. She began to wonder if she might\nwind up buried under a basement floor while he spent his ill-gotten\nbribe.\n\nThen the Greenie woman pulled aside a large crate and opened another\ndoor. To pass through this one, they all had to stoop. Marie realized\nthat they were then in the cellar of another building. The blocks of\nstone forming the walls looked damp and dirty.\n\nThey proceeded to climb stairs again, and to traverse another hall.\nMaria thought they ended up going in a direction away from the street.\nThe woman led them through a small, dark series of rooms, and finally\ninto one with windows set too high in the walls to see out. There she\nhalted and faced Willard.\n\nThe Greenie prison official dropped the cord and reached into an inner\npocket of his drab uniform. He withdrew a thick packet of Greenhaven\ncurrency. The numbers and units were too unfamiliar for Maria to guess\nat the value from one quick glance; but the attitude of their hostess\nsuggested that it was substantial. Willard handed it over. Maria\ndecided it was time to set down her bag.\n\nThe woman went immediately to a large chest in a corner of the room and\nopened it. She set aside a mirror she took out of the chest, then began\nto pull out other objects. There was a case which she handed to Willard\nand a great many articles of clothing that were probably considered\nfeminine on this world.\n\n\"The point is,\" Willard said in low tones, \"you are going to have to\nhave proper clothes to look natural on the street. See if that dress\nwill fit you.\"\n\nMaria took the thing distastefully, but it looked to be about the right\nlength when she held it up against her. The Greenie woman nodded. She\nadded a sort of full-length flannel slip and a petticoat to the dress.\n\n\"Now I know why the Greenie women look so grim,\" said Maria. \"It would\nbe almost worth dying to stay out of such a rig.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue!\" said Willard.\n\nMaria made a face.\n\n\"Present company excepted, of course!\" she added.\n\n\"Change!\" ordered Willard. \"We have no time to waste.\"\n\nHe took the mirror and the small case to a rude table under one of\nthe windows. He opened the box so that Maria caught a glimpse of the\ncontents, which looked like an actor's make-up kit.\n\nThe Greenie woman joggled Maria's elbow and spoke for the first time.\n\n\"I must not be long, or it will be noticed,\" she hinted.\n\n\"Give her your clothes to burn and get into the others,\" said Willard,\nbending over the table with his back to her. \"As soon as I get myself\nfixed here, I'll change your face too.\"\n\nMaria looked about in a manner to suggest that she hoped they knew what\nthey were doing. The Greenie woman waited. Maria reached up and began\nto unbutton her blouse.\n\nShe dropped it across her bag. The woman picked both of them up, and\nwaited. She looked a trifle shocked at the sight of the thin slip when\nMaria unzipped her skirt and hauled it over her head. By the time the\nslip followed, she was standing with downcast eyes.\n\nMaria eyed the broad back in the drab uniform as she unfastened\nher brassiere. This would make a good story someday, but to tell\nit in the wrong company might be to invite catty remarks about her\nattractiveness. She could think of other men who might not have kept\ntheir backs so rigidly turned as did Willard. It was almost provocative.\n\nShe slipped down the brief panties, stepped out of them, and handed\nthem over. The Greenie woman pointed silently to the shoes. Marie\nkicked them off, and they were added to the pile. She hoped that\nwhatever was in the chest for footwear would not be too hard to walk in.\n\nThe Greenie woman thrust the flannel atrocity at her and left the room\nhastily. Maria watched the door close softly, then held the garment\nout at arm's length. It did not look any better. She took a few steps\ntoward Willard.\n\n_I'll bet I could make him faint dead away_, she thought\nmischievously. _I'd love to see the look on his face if ... well, why\nnot? I will!_\n\n\"She's gone,\" she announced in a low voice. \"How do I get into this\nthing?\"\n\nWillard looked around, and the look was nothing she had ever seen\nbefore. His face appeared fuller in the cheeks, his eyebrows were black\nand heavy, his nose high at the bridge, and his whole complexion was\ndarker.\n\nHe nodded at her gasp.\n\n\"Those papers I turned in for you won't last too long. The estimate is\nthat they will dissolve before tomorrow morning, but they just might\ncome apart sooner. If he sends out an alarm, I don't want to be on the\nstreets in shape to be recognized.\"\n\n\"That's wonderful!\" said Maria enthusiastically. \"Are you going to make\nme up too?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Willard. \"Get into those things so I can start!\"\n\nMaria watched his eyes flicker to her breasts and then sweep down the\nrest of her body. She thought he was taking it very well, unless it was\nthe make-up.\n\n\"Will you help me with this thing?\" she begged. \"I never saw one\nbefore.\"\n\nShe held out the flannel garment with a helpless smile, planting the\nother hand on her bare hip.\n\n\"_Will_ you quit teasing, you little bitch!\" Willard snapped. \"I'm no\nGreenie, if that's what you thought. You could get us involved to the\npoint of missing the ship.\"\n\nMaria felt her eyes popping. A tingling, hot flush lit her face. It\nspread back to her neck and crept down to her breasts. She snatched the\nflannel sack to her and turned her back.\n\nSomehow, she maneuvered it over her head. Then she fumbled on the\nstarched petticoat and topped the whole with the dun-colored dress that\nfell chastely about her ankles. Willard handed her a pair of low heeled\nshoes that were only a little loose when she put them on.\n\nHe had her stand facing one of the windows while he darkened her face\nand put a black wig on her. She looked up at the window and stood very\nstill.\n\n\"Now, listen!\" said Willard. \"You'll absolutely have to stop blushing\nlike that, or the color of the skin is going to come all wrong!\"\n\n\"I can't help it,\" she said meekly. Then she saw he was laughing at\nher, and gave him a rueful smile. \"Where did all that modesty come\nfrom? It was the shock, I suppose.\"\n\n\"All right, it was funny. When we get out on the street again, forget\nall about what's funny! Look like a serious Greenie!\"\n\n\"Funny?\" objected Maria. \"I always thought I made a pretty fair showing\nin comparison to the local gals.\"\n\n\"Oh, you did, you did! One of the best showings I've ever seen.\"\n\nHe pressed a hand to each side of her waist, then slid them up her ribs\nuntil the weight of her breasts rested against his wrists.\n\n\"We'll talk about this again when we make it to the ship,\" he told her\nin a low voice. \"Right now, it would be foolish to spoil this make-up.\"\n\nHe turned away after a long moment and returned the kit to the chest.\nThey left by the same door by which they had entered, but Willard knew\na short way out to a different street. Maria thought it must be the one\noutside the high windows. He set off at a businesslike pace.\n\nThey traveled about a quarter of a mile, counting several turns by\nwhich he sacrificed directness for sparsely peopled streets. The\ndisguises must have been effective, for they drew no second glances.\nIt was not until she saw the gibbet that Maria realized they were\napproaching the outskirts of the city.\n\n\"What--?\" she began, sensing the reality of her plight for the first\ntime.\n\n\"Quiet! Look the other way, if you must, but don't be obvious about it.\"\n\nSeveral examples of rigid Greenhaven justice were on exhibit to a\nmodest crowd. Three men and two women sat in stocks. They were not,\napparently, subject to rock-throwing or other abuse, as Maria seemed to\nremember had been the custom on ancient Terra; but they were clearly\nunhappy and mortified. From the gibbet behind them swung the body of\na hanged man. It appeared to have been there for some time. Maria\nwondered what _he_ had done to corrupt the morals or the economics of\nGreenhaven.\n\nWhat nearly made her sick was the sight of a party of two dozen\nchildren being guided on a tour of the place. One youngster whined, and\nwas thoroughly cuffed by the Greenie in charge.\n\nThen they were past, and Maria saw the high cyclone fence of the Terran\nspaceport. Willard took a look at her face. Seemingly satisfied, he\nexplained that they had come to a section well away from the main\nentrance. He led her along the fence for perhaps a hundred yards, found\na small gate, and unlocked it with a key produced from under his belt.\nMaria, remembering their exit from the jail, was not surprised to feel\na good-natured slap on the bottom as she stepped onto Terran land.\nThere was another quarter-mile to go, but it was open land.\n\n\"We have it made now,\" said Willard, locking the gate behind them.\n\nThey by-passed the administration and custom buildings, and headed\ndirectly for the field elevator beside the waiting spaceship, ignoring\nthe possibility of causing inquiries to be made by local eagle-eyes who\nmight think they had seen two Greenies board the vessel.\n\n\"Willard, of the Department of Interstellar Relations,\" he introduced\nhimself to a surprised ship's officer. \"You've been told to expect Miss\nRingstad?\"\n\nThe officer, staring in bald disbelief at Maria's costume, admitted\nthat the ship was more or less being held for her arrival.\n\n\"One thing was unexpected,\" said Willard. \"I am exercising my authority\nto demand a cabin for myself as well. I have reason to suspect that my\ndisguise had been penetrated, which, of course, makes it very dangerous\nfor me.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" agreed the officer. \"Let's go, by all means!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Maria. \"I want to get out of this awful rig.\"\n\n\"That's what I meant,\" said Willard.\n\nThere was no doubt that the influence behind Willard had held the ship\nfor them. It rose as soon as they could reach a pair of tiny cabins.\nLater, after the first surge of the take-off, there were a number of\ndelays stretching between minor course corrections.\n\nFinally, it was announced over the public address system that because\nof precautionary checking of the course, there would be no spin to\nsimulate planetary gravity for about two hours. Maria hoped that she\nwould not be revealed as the cause to the disgruntled passengers.\n\nShe was still considering this and trying to disentangle herself from\nthe acceleration net slung in the ten-foot cubicle they were pleased to\ncall a cabin, when Willard arrived.\n\n\"I made friends with some of the crew,\" he announced. \"Everybody likes\nto help out a D.I.R. agent. It must strike them as romantic.\"\n\n\"They should know,\" said Maria, thinking of the long, suspenseful walk\nthrough Greenhaven's streets.\n\n\"There was a stewardess who had extra slacks and blouse about your\nsize.\"\n\n\"You must have a good eye,\" she told him. \"Or think you have, anyhow.\nFirst, get me out of this thing. What with this Greenie outfit too, I\nmight as well be in a straitjacket!\"\n\nHe pushed himself over to the net and began to open the zipper. She\nsaw that he had taken time to remove his \"Greenie\" face.\n\nHer first motion, when the net was open, sent her tumbling head over\nheels to the far bulkhead.\n\n\"Keep a grip on something,\" laughed Willard. \"Here--I brought a small\nkit along. Let me fix your face.\"\n\nShe obediently clung to the anchoring shock springs at one end of the\nnet and turned her face up so that he could work on the mask he had\nearlier painted on. His fingers were gentle, smoothing in the cream he\nhad brought and rubbing off the make-up with lightly perfumed tissues.\nMaria closed her eyes luxuriously and thought how pleasant it was to be\noff Greenhaven.\n\n\"Was it very complicated, getting me out of there?\" she asked.\n\n\"There were a lot of angles to think of,\" he answered, \"but we pulled\nit off as slickly as I've ever seen done. Just strolled right out\nthrough them all. Things in this business don't often go that well to\nplan. There--now you look human again, just like when I started to put\nthat face on you.\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" smiled Maria, plucking ruefully at the native Mother\nHubbard, which billowed hideously about her in the zero gravity.\n\n\"That's easily changed,\" Willard said, meeting her smile significantly.\n\"See if you can find your way out any better than you did getting into\nit, while I sort out the clothes I got for us.\"\n\nBetween the reaction from the strain of the past few hours and a glow\nof gratitude toward her rescuer. Maria began to sense the stir of an\nemotion within her that took a few moments to recognize. It surprised\nher a little.\n\n\"Willard,\" she said lazily, \"it's funny, but I feel just as if I'm\nfalling in love with you.\"\n\n\"That's interesting,\" grinned the agent. \"About time, too.\"\n\n\"I can't tell if my knees are weak,\" she went on, laying a hand on his\nshoulder to draw herself closer, \"because I'm hanging in mid-air; but\nyou always seem to be making me strip--and I find myself not minding.\"\n\n\"I don't mind either!\" he assured her.\n\nWhen his arm slipped around her waist and he kissed her, Maria was\nsure. She let her lips part gradually, trembling as the fever rose in\nher.\n\n\"Let me go a minute,\" she murmured.\n\nPresently, after a few weightless contortions, the muffling Greenhaven\nflannels were sent swirling into a corner. Maria laughed softly as\nshe set a bare foot against the bulkhead to launch herself back into\nWillard's arms.\n\n\n\n\nEIGHTEEN\n\n\nWas it the pain in his head that made everything seem to sway?\n\nOr was it the swaying that made his head hurt?\n\nTaranto opened his eyes slowly. For two or three minutes, in the\ndarkness, he did not understand what he saw.\n\nGradually, comprehension developed. He was on a litter again, and the\nbearers were descending a rough track into a shallow valley. There was\nno sign of the city or of any other landmark even vaguely familiar.\nJagged rocks formed a ridge to his left, curving around to enclose the\ndepression. Other rocky buttes, he saw through slitted eyes, projected\nfrom the barren rubble of the Valley floor. There seemed to be little\nsand, unless it had blown down into the lower areas.\n\nCautiously, letting his head roll with the lurching motion of the\nbearers, he learned that another group was ahead. He thought they must\nbe guarding Meyers. The red-uniformed officer marched just preceding\nTaranto's litter. That meant that there must be two soldiers behind,\nout of his view.\n\n_What now?_ he asked himself. _It was a good try, but it didn't work\nout._\n\nIt seemed hopeless to attempt anything further until he found out where\nhe was. Nor would it do any harm to learn _how_ he was--they must have\ncrowned him beautifully. He tried to move his arms and legs slightly\nwithout being obviously restless. Nothing felt broken. There was just\nthe sore throbbing behind his left ear.\n\nWere they taking him and Meyers further into the desert, to make sure\nthey could properly be reported dead? Or was the party on its way back\nto the city?\n\nTaranto moved about stealthily, as the litter heaved from side to\nside and bounced about with the efforts of his bearers to negotiate\noutcroppings of rock. He was surprised that his arms and legs were not\ntied. He wondered how long he had been out cold. Perhaps the Syssokans\nbelieved he really was dead from that spear across the skull.\n\n_You shouldn't have underestimated that guy just because you dropped\nhim a few times_, he told himself. _You caught on to the difference,\nbut he learned it from you._\n\nFrom ahead and lower on the path came voices. There was a brisk breeze,\nbut Taranto thought he could recognize Meyers giving vent to an\noutraged whine.\n\n_Wonder how much of a grudge they'll hold?_ he thought. _Some of them\nmust be lumped up pretty good._\n\nHe was beginning to locate a number of scrapes and bruises on his own\nsturdy frame. He wondered if it might be best to take things easy until\nthey reached either their desert destination or the area outside the\ncity, according to which way they were headed, and then offer to bribe\nthe officer in charge. It would probably be too risky: he would have\nto rely on large promises, and they had already caught him in a crude\nwhopper. Whatever the case, it would be unwise to open negotiations\nwithout finding out what the Syssokan commander looked like. Taranto\nseemed to recall pasting the fellow pretty thoroughly.\n\nHe caught a few words of Terran, blown back to him by a random gust.\nMeyers was complaining about being too tired to walk any farther. It\ndid not sound as though he were making his point.\n\n_Of course!_ Taranto realized. _I must be in his stretcher. Mine was\nbusted. Now the slob will put it on me for making him bump his rump\nalong this trail!_\n\nThe image was not without humor. Contemplating it gave Taranto a\nmomentary satisfaction.\n\nWell, they knew Meyers was alive, even if they might not be sure about\nTaranto himself. Perhaps they were merely saving both Terrans for a\nlonger jail term. Taranto hoped that the Syssokans had nothing more\nunpleasant in mind. The remarks he had used earlier in his attempt to\nbluff the officer could be used for inimical purposes by anyone who\ncared to point out that Syssokan knowledge of Terran physiology was\nscanty. Then what?\n\nTaranto decided that he would be foolish to worry along that line at\nthe present. What he needed was an idea for getting loose again. He\nspeculated for a few minutes upon his chances of backtracking to the\nscene of his attempt at escape. Somewhere near there, in whichever\ndirection it was, a spaceship should be landing.\n\n_If they ain't been and gone already_, he thought.\n\nIn his supine position on the stretcher, he was able to see the sky\nwithout moving. That was why the distant trail of light was visible to\nhim for some moments before any of the Syssokans could notice it.\n\n_I can't wait it out after all_, he realized.\n\nThe ship would be heard presently, and the flare of its braking rockets\nwould arouse the guards. Taranto peeked around again and saw that they\nwere nearing the foot of the slope. Following the natural motion of\nthe bearers, he let himself roll a little too far each time the litter\nswayed. The Syssokans struggled to compensate while scrabbling for\nsafe footholds on the hard, slippery surface.\n\nIn the end, one of them slipped. The litter crashed down. Taranto added\na twist to the natural force of gravity, so that he rolled downhill.\n\nThe fallen bearer picked himself up, mumbling something in Syssokan\nthat sounded remarkably belligerent. One of the others moved to recover\nthe stretcher. Taranto kept on rolling.\n\nAt the first yell, he gave up the pretense and regained his feet with a\nlithe bound. For the next sixty seconds, he needed every last smidgin\nof concentration to escape taking a fatal spill on the sloping rocks.\n\nHurtling downward in great leaps, he was forced to hurdle large rocks\nbecause his velocity prevented him from changing course by even a foot.\nOnce he skidded, thinking his time had come. Near the bottom, where the\nincline curved to meet the horizontal, he did go down, ploughing up a\nspatter of loose chips and pebbles.\n\nHe was up and running again without quite knowing how. A dark shape\nloomed up before him, a rock twice his height. Before passing it, he\ntook the chance of looking back.\n\nThe litter party was in a state of confusion. The officer and two\nsoldiers were bounding after him, slanting away on a more reasonable\npath. One Syssokan was still in the process of picking himself up, and\nmost of the others were either milling about or just beginning to heed\ntheir leader's shouts to follow Taranto.\n\nThe intention of yelling to Meyers flashed across his mind but he\ndismissed it as being useless. A hasty glance in the opposite direction\nshowed him the fire trail settling behind another ridge to his right\nfront. The valley bore a certain resemblance to a meteor crater.\n\nTaranto sprinted past the huge rock and bore right toward the distant\nridge. He would try to locate the ship if and when he reached the\nridge. The immediate necessity was to keep out of the clutches of the\nburial party.\n\nRunning in the starlit darkness was risky, as he soon found. The ground\nwas strewn with occasional patches of loose stone, traps of nature\nsuitable for tripping the unwary or causing a sprain. The only thing\nthat kept Taranto reckless was the sounds of pursuit behind him.\n\nHe had gone about two hundred yards when he realized that some of the\nrock-scattering noises came from his right more than from behind. The\nSyssokan were better runners than he, and used to the local terrain\nbesides. He could not tell whether they had seen the trail of the\nspaceship or, if so, whether they connected it with him.\n\n_But they know enough to head me off, whichever way I go_, he thought.\n\nHe came unexpectedly to a patch of sand, and swore as he felt his speed\nslacken. A desperate glance over his shoulder revealed no pursuers,\nthough he knew they were there somewhere. He could see two runners who\nhad flanked him on the right fifty yards off; and these forced him into\nbearing away from his desired course.\n\nInstead of passing to the right of a tall outcropping of rock ahead, he\nturned left. It took him farther from the direction of the spaceship,\nbut there was no help for it. He floundered over a low dune of sand and\nthen was out of it and running on flat ground. He circled to the left\nof the hill, hearing a howl from the rear.\n\n_Must have seen me against the open valley_, thought Taranto. _They\nsound closer than I like._\n\nHe ran on, scanning the shadowed rocks towering over him for a place to\nclimb. It was a foregone conclusion that the two flankers would be on\nthe lookout for him as he came around the hill.\n\nAt last he thought he saw a way up, a sloping ledge leading to a\nsmall plateau before the rock reared higher in a sheer cliff. Taranto\nscrambled over a waist-high boulder and made for the opening. Up\nhe went, on hands and toes. The rock was ridged, but in the wrong\ndirection, and he slipped to hands and knees twice before he was up.\n\nHe slowed to a quick walk as he reached the level expanse. It was ten\nor twelve feet above the valley floor and curved off to the right\naround the base of the cliff. Taranto was panting by now, but his main\nreason for slowing was that he wanted to make less noise until he\nspotted the two Syssokans he expected to meet.\n\nThe broad ledge he was following dipped, rose a few feet, and dipped\nagain to less than ten feet above the level ground. Taranto flattened\nhimself suddenly.\n\nThe two Syssokans came loping along the shadowy edge of the\noutcropping, spears at the ready. From around the cliff sounded a call.\nThe first soldier threw back his head to answer. As the howl left\nhis throat, and masked the noise of the Terran's scrambling, Taranto\nlaunched himself upon the back of the second.\n\nThey went down with a thump upon hard rocks. Taranto, saving his ribs\nfrom being caved in by fending himself off from a jagged rock with his\nforearm, kicked out and caught the downed Syssokan in the belly. As the\nsoldier subsided, the Terran snatched up the spear and rose to face\nthe other one.\n\nIt had all gone so fast that the leader was just turning back. Perhaps\nhe thought merely that his companion had fallen, but the stocky\nsilhouette of the spacer disabused him of that idea. He advanced with\nthe point of his spear weaving about menacingly.\n\n\"You think you're good with that stick, eh?\" growled Taranto. \"Well,\ntry this for something different!\"\n\nGripping his spear near the head, he swung the heavier butt like a bat,\nputting as much power into it as he could. It was crude, but he knew\nbetter than to try to match skills with a soldier trained to the use of\nthe weapon.\n\nThe butt cracked resoundingly against the shaft of the Syssokan's\nspear, tearing it from the grip of his leading hand. Taranto's own\nhands were numbed by the shock. He dropped his spear and slid inside\nthe Syssokan's one-handed grip before it could be reinforced. The feint\nof a left hook to the belly made the soldier relinquish his weapon\ncompletely and grapple with the spacer.\n\nTaranto found his left arm entwined with the right of the Syssokan. He\ntried twice to punch to the body with his free hand but was smothered.\nBefore he could think of it himself, the Syssokan stamped hard upon his\ntoes.\n\n\"Bastard!\" spat the spacer.\n\nHe butted, successfully but profitlessly. He rabbit-punched twice with\nhis right hand, reaching around under the soldier's armpit. Only when\nhe gouged at a large, black eye did the defending arm come up.\n\nTaranto set his feet and banged three times to the midsection, getting\nplenty of body twist into his motion.\n\nHe found himself holding a very limp Syssokan, who slid down as the\nspacer stepped back.\n\nTaranto sucked in a gasping breath. He staggered aside to pick up the\nspears, feeling better now that he was armed, no matter how primitively.\n\nHe had hardly straightened up when he saw the officer round the edge\nof the little butte, a mere fifty feet away. The Syssokan hesitated at\nthe sight of the Terran standing over two of his soldiers, and Taranto\nthrew one of the spears.\n\nThe trouble was that he did not know how to handle one. A spear, after\nall, was not standard equipment on a spaceship. The point twisted away\nfrom the target, and much of the force went into a slow spin. The\nofficer hissed a disdainful comment and caught the weapon out of the\nair with one hand.\n\nTaranto stooped for a rock, which he hurled with more effect. It\nshattered with a fine crack against the cliff near enough to the\nSyssokan to make him throw himself behind a boulder for cover. Taranto\nleft him in the middle of a yell to his soldiers and sprinted off into\nthe open valley.\n\nCarrying the spear did not help matters much, but he thought the\nSyssokans might regard it as a more dangerous deterrent than he knew\nit to be in his untrained hands. The next time he looked around, he\nsaw that he could rejoice in a splendid lead of two hundred yards. On\nthe other hand, the officer now had a numerous group with him, and\nwould probably get organized at last. Taranto slowed to a jog, to save\nhimself against the time when they should begin to catch up.\n\n\"Taranto!\" said a small voice.\n\nHe broke automatically into a dead run, without even looking around.\n\n\"Wait, Taranto!\" called the little voice. \"Look up, for the spy-eye!\"\n\nThe spacer slowed as understanding burst upon him. He looked back and\nsaw a spark of light gaining on him. It arrived and hovered over his\nhead.\n\n\"It may still work,\" the voice informed him. \"The ship is down. I\ntold them what happened, and they're putting up a helicopter. Where's\nMeyers?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Taranto. \"Back on the ridge, I guess. Look, I\ncan't just stand here until that 'copter comes. I'll be a pincushion.\"\n\n\"Head for that hill ahead about a quarter-mile,\" said the voice from\nthe little flyer. \"I'll guide them there.\"\n\nThe Syssokans were running now, spreading out in a well-drilled manner.\nTaranto boosted himself into high speed again.\n\nThe hill ahead was more toward the center of the valley. If the\npursuers were aware of some connection between his flight and the\nposition of the spaceship, they would be satisfied to have him heading\naway from the ridge enclosing the valley. Taranto hoped that they would\nnot worry enough to turn on a burst of speed, for he was convinced that\nthey could outrun him.\n\nHe was right--he reached the steep slopes of the hill with a bare fifty\nyards left of his lead, and he was on the point of foundering at that.\nHis knees buckled for an instant as he hit the first rise, and he saved\nhimself from pitching on his face only by thrusting out the butt of the\nspear he carried.\n\nSomehow, he made it another fifty feet up the slope, hearing the voice\nbeside his ear say, \"To the right, Taranto! Head for that flat spot!\nHere comes the helicopter.\"\n\nHe wiped salty sweat from his eyes with the back of one hand and\nlooked up. A large, quietly whirring shape shadowed the stars. It\ndropped rapidly toward him as a howl broke out behind him.\n\nTaranto took the spear in both hands, holding it at one end, and sent\nit whirling end over end at the closing Syssokans. The whole center of\nthe group dropped flat to let it swish over their heads.\n\nBefore they could rise, the helicopter reached Taranto. It came down\nso fast it bounced against the ground. Someone held out a hand to\nTaranto and yelled to him to jump. He was hauled into an open cockpit.\nSomeone took a deathgrip on the waistband of his pants and he felt the\nhelicopter climb.\n\nHe wiggled around until he could get his knees under him. There were\ntwo spacers in the cockpit of what was obviously an auxiliary craft\nfrom a spaceship. One of them, a very long-eared type with a narrow\nhead, looked as if he had been born in some stellar colony. The other\nhad a broad, bland face of an oriental Terran.\n\n\"Where is the other one?\" asked the latter.\n\nTaranto crept between the seats to which they were strapped before\nanswering, for there were only chains at the open sides. He got his\nbearings, and directed the long-eared pilot to the ridge where he had\nrolled out of the litter.\n\nIt nearly broke his heart to see them reach it in less than a minute.\n\n\"There may be guards with him,\" he warned. \"Maybe he took off too.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" said the broad-faced spacer.\n\nHe ran a spotlight along the ridge, stopped, and brought it back to\nbear upon a lonely figure. Meyers stood up and waved. No Syssokan was\nin sight; the officer must have taken them all with him.\n\n_He knew what he was doing_, thought Taranto. _The guy's still here._\n\nThe helicopter eased down to hover over a large rock. Meyers climbed\nlaboriously upon it and was hauled aboard. Taranto squeezed himself\nback behind the seats to make room.\n\n\"It's about time you got here,\" puffed Meyers. \"I'm worn out.\"\n\nTaranto said nothing as the craft rose in the air and swooped off\ntoward the spaceship. Someday, Meyers would ask how he had gotten away\nfrom the Syssokans. When it happened, Taranto swore to himself, he\nwould _show_ the slob.\n\n\n\n\nNINETEEN\n\n\nIt was twenty after eight when Westervelt found himself back at the\ncommunications room with Smith. Rosenkrantz had alerted them to a\nmessage coming in from Syssoka.\n\n\"They didn't expect to hit us during office hours,\" he explained, \"but\nas long as you're here, I thought maybe you'd like to get it fresh.\"\n\nSmith had told the girls to pass the word to Lydman and Parrish, and\nWestervelt had followed him down the hall with the feeling that he\nhad displayed his eye under the good lighting long enough. Now they\nlistened as a slim, brown-haired man with a faintly scholarly aura\ncompleted his report on the escape of Louis Taranto and Harley Meyers,\nspacers.\n\nJoe Rosenkrantz was fiddling with an auxiliary screen and murmuring\ninto another microphone.\n\n\n\"... so it was a rather close call, even though the formula you sent\nus appears to have worked perfectly,\" said the scholarly man. \"I have\nnot been able to determine exactly what caused the delay on the part of\nthe Syssokans, since it seemed imprudent to display my little flying\nspy-eye where it might be seen, or even damaged.\"\n\n\"Maybe you can pick up some rumors in the future,\" suggested Smith. \"If\nyou do, we'd appreciate hearing them, to add to our file and make the\ncase as complete as possible.\"\n\nThe transmission lag was much less than that occurring with Trident.\nThe D.I.R. man on Syssoka agreed to forward any subsequent discoveries.\n\n\"Those spacers you contacted are already heading out-system,\" he told\nSmith. \"I think they did a nice, clean job. It was too bad that they\nwere seen at all, of course, but it will be news to me if the Syssokans\ndrop around with any embarrassing questions.\"\n\n\"Well, there _is_ a large foreign quarter there,\" Smith recalled. \"Why\nshould they suspect Terrans, after all?\"\n\n\"Oh, they will, they will. They suspect everyone; but they must know so\nlittle that I feel sure I can bluff them. I can prove that I was here\nat the official residence all day.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Smith. \"Just in passing, I take it that no one was much\nhurt?\"\n\nThe man on Syssokan grinned briefly.\n\n\"No one on our side,\" he said, \"although I understand the prisoners\nwere suffering some from exhaustion and dehydration. This Louis Taranto\nseems to be quite a lad. There is reason to believe that he killed two\nor three of his guards with his bare hands--at least I saw the burial\nparty carrying bodies with them as they marched the rest of the way\nback to the city.\"\n\nSmith laughed.\n\n\"I'll have to add a note opposite his name and contact him. I could use\na field agent like that! Well, my operator tells me I have another call\ncoming in. Thanks for your work on this.\"\n\n\"A pleasure,\" said the man on Syssoka. \"I really didn't expect to\ncontact you directly; my relative-time atlas must be a little old.\"\n\n\"No, it's just that we never sleep, you know,\" quipped Smith, and\nsigned off.\n\nHe looked around, saw that it was Parrish who had entered, and added,\n\"At least, it _looks_ as if we'll never sleep. I'm getting tired of it\nmyself.\"\n\n\"So is everybody except Joe, here,\" said Parrish. \"A com man isn't\nnormal anyway.\"\n\n\"You gotta learn not to let all this stuff coming through bother you,\"\nsaid Rosenkrantz wisely. \"If I soaked up all these crazy calls, I'd\nhave nightmares every day. As it is, I'm as normal as anybody when I\nleave here.\"\n\n\"You haven't been with us long enough,\" said Smith. \"What else do you\nhave there?\"\n\n\"There was a routine memo to make a check with the planet Greenhaven,\"\nsaid Rosenkrantz. \"I cleared it when a good time came. The D.I.R.\nstation there pretended not to know what I was talking about.\"\n\n\"What?\" yelped Smith. \"Don't tell me we goofed on another one!\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" said Rosenkrantz. \"While you were talking to\nSyssoka, a spaceship named _Vulpecula_ called, said there was reason to\nbelieve the Greenhaven D.I.R. was locally monitored.\"\n\n\"Tapped or the scrambler system broken,\" said Parrish. \"What does this\nship want to talk about?\"\n\n\"The Ringstad case.\"\n\n\"Joe, godammit, who says you're normal?\" demanded Smith. \"I bet we've\nsprung another one! Two in one night--we're coming out with a good\naverage after all. Get them on the screen before I pop my tanks!\"\n\nWestervelt listened to the transmission from the spaceship. Without the\nhelp of a planetary relay at the far end, it tended to be a trifle weak\nand wavery, but the essentials came through. He left Smith and Parrish\npatting each other on the back and went back to tell the girls about it.\n\nThey clustered around him in the main office, even Pauline leaving her\ncubicle for a moment and keeping one ear pointed at the switchboard\ninside.\n\n\"You should have heard Smitty conning her out of writing us up for the\nnews magazines,\" said Westervelt. \"She seems to be pretty famous in her\nline.\"\n\n\"What was she like?\" asked Simonetta.\n\n\"She looked blondish, but the color wasn't coming across too well.\nNot bad looking, in a breezy sort of way. The agent that sprung her\nhad to skip too, because he thought the Greenhavens--they call them\nGreenies--had spotted his disguise.\"\n\n\"Oh, boy!\" breathed Pauline. \"The cops must have been hot on their\ntrail!\"\n\n\"Either that, or he wanted to go along with her for other reasons,\"\nsaid Westervelt. \"They seemed kind of chummy.\"\n\n\"Can they do that?\" asked Beryl. \"I mean, without orders, and all that?\"\n\nWestervelt grinned.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he admitted, \"but he's doing it. He can't go back now.\nAnyway, Smitty simmered down fast and promised a draft for expenses\nwould be waiting for him when the ship made planetfall. Technically,\nthe D.I.R. ought to pay, because it turns out the guy is on their rolls\nand was only working with us temporarily.\"\n\nSimonetta nodded wisely.\n\n\"You watch our boss,\" she predicted. \"He'll have this man on our lists.\nHe always gets free with the money when he sees a good prospect from\nthe main branch. Even if they stay in the honest side of the outfit,\nthey co-operate with the back room here.\"\n\nSmith walked in with Parrish, beaming. His eye found Westervelt.\n\n\"Willie,\" he said, \"make a note, and tomorrow look up the planet\nRotchen II. I have to send credits, and I didn't want to say into wide,\nwide space that I didn't know where it is. Bad for the department's\nprestige!\"\n\nHe looked about genially.\n\n\"I see you've told the news,\" he commented. \"It was a lift for me too.\nWe haven't done too badly, after all. Won two, lost one--damn!--and one\nis still a stalemate.\"\n\n\"Anyone tell Bob?\" asked Parrish quietly.\n\nThey all exchanged searching glances. Smith began to lose some of his\nebullience. After a moment, he turned to Pauline.\n\n\"Buzz his office!\" he said in a preoccupied tone.\n\nWestervelt tried to subdue a mild chill along the backbone as Pauline\ngave Smith a wide-eyed look and slipped into her cubbyhole.\n\n_He couldn't have phoned downstairs_, he reassured himself. _Pauline\nwould say all the lines were busy, or cut off or something. But what if\nhe looked out a window?_\n\nSmith had sauntered over to the center desk, where he waited beside the\nphone. It seemed to be taking Pauline a long time.\n\n\"Check with Joe,\" advised Parrish. \"Then try around the other rooms.\nTen to one he's in the lab.\"\n\n\"Has anyone seen him in the last half hour?\" asked Smith.\n\nWestervelt pointed out that he had been the chief's company in the\ncommunications room. The girls had not seen Lydman, but admitted that\nhe might have gone past in the corridor without their having noticed.\n\n\"Yeah, he doesn't make much noise,\" Parrish agreed.\n\nSmith had a thought. He moved toward his own office, paused to jerk his\nhead significantly toward Parrish's, and opened his own door. Parrish\nwent over past Beryl's desk and thrust his head into his own office.\nLydman was not in either room.\n\n\"Mr. Smith!\" called Pauline in a worried tone. \"I'm sorry, but I can't\nseem to reach him.\"\n\n\"Oh, Christ!\" said Parrish. \"He isn't talking again!\"\n\nHe did something Westervelt had never seen that self-possessed man\nresort to before this evening. He began to gnaw nervously upon a\nknuckle. He saw the youth staring, and snatched his hand from his mouth.\n\nSmith glowered unhappily at the floor. Westervelt thought he could hear\nhis own pulse, so quiet had the office grown.\n\nThe chief backed up to the unpleasant decision.\n\n\"We'd better spread out and wander around until someone sees him face\nto face,\" he said. \"If he wants to be let alone, let him alone! Just\npass the word on where he is.\"\n\nWestervelt volunteered to go down one wing while Parrish took the\nother. As they left, cautioned to take their time and act natural,\nSmith was telling the girls to open the doors to the adjacent offices\nagain and keep their ears tuned, in case Lydman should come looking for\nhim or Parrish.\n\nWestervelt turned right past the stairs, and went to the door of the\nlibrary.\n\n_It will be perfectly natural_, he told himself. _We made out on two\ncases. I just want to tell him about it, in case he hasn't heard. Why\nthe hell don't they get that cable fixed? They want their bills paid on\ntime, don't they?_\n\nHe could hear the newcasts now, about how tough a job the electricians\nfaced, and how tense was the situation. Westervelt decided he would not\nlisten.\n\nHe opened the door to the library casually and sauntered in. The pose\nwas wasted; Lydman was not there.\n\nWestervelt went on to the conference room on this side, and found it\nempty as well. He looked in on Joe Rosenkrantz, who, from the door,\nappeared to be alone. Just to leave no stone unturned, he retreated up\nthe hall to the door marked \"Shaft\" and poked his head inside. He had\nto grope around for a light switch, and when he found it was rewarded\nwith nothing more than the sight of a number of conduits running from\nfloor to unfinished ceiling. A little dust drifted down on him from\natop the ones that bent to run to outlets on the same floor.\n\n\"Well, nobody can say I overlooked anything,\" grumbled Westervelt.\n\nHe went back to the communications room. Rosenkrantz was listening\nin on some conversation from a station on Luna that was none of his\nbusiness.\n\n\"Any sign of Lydman around here?\" asked Westervelt.\n\n\"Not since the Yoleen brawl,\" grunted Rosenkrantz. \"That's a\ngood-looking babe running that Lunar station. Why can't we dig up some\nmessages for them?\"\n\n\"I'll work on it,\" promised Westervelt halfheartedly.\n\nHe walked quietly around the corner past the power equipment. No\nLydman. The next step was the laboratory. He looked at his watch, then\nleaned against the wire mesh partition for a good ten minutes. Let\nParrish cover the ground, he decided.\n\nIn the end, with no sign of Parrish or Lydman, he opened the door and\nstepped into the dark laboratory. He made his way cautiously ahead,\nthinking that Lydman was probably in his office. Feeling his path with\nslow steps, and carefully avoiding the possibility of tipping over any\nof the stacks of cartons, he had progressed to the center of the large\nchamber when the lights went on.\n\nWestervelt felt as if he had jumped a foot, and the blood pounded\nthrough his veins.\n\nGaping around with open mouth, he finally met the eye of Pete Parrish,\nwho stood half inside the doorway to the corridor, his hand still\nraised to the light switch.\n\nThey both relaxed. Parrish smiled feebly, with less than normal display\nof his fine teeth. Westervelt contented himself with passing a hand\nacross his forehead. It came away damp.\n\n\"Well,\" said Parrish, \"where was he?\"\n\nWestervelt closed his eyes and groaned.\n\n\"You're kidding,\" he said. \"Please say you're kidding! It's too late in\nthe day to fool around, Pete.\"\n\nParrish looked alarmed. He strode forward, letting the door close\nbehind him. Westervelt, finding himself shivering in a draft, went to\nmeet him.\n\n\"I'm not kidding at all,\" said Parrish. \"Did you look everywhere? Are\nyou sure?\"\n\n\"I even poked into the power shaft,\" retorted Westervelt. \"Were you in\nhis office?\"\n\n\"Naturally. I checked everything, even the men's room.\"\n\nThey had wandered back to the corridor door, peering about the\nlaboratory to make sure no one could have concealed himself on the\nfloor under a workbench, or behind a pile of cartons.\n\nParrish opened the door, and they stood puzzling at the empty hall.\n\n\"He wasn't even taking a shower,\" said the elder man.\n\nWestervelt brooded for a moment.\n\n\"Did you say _everywhere_?\" he insisted.\n\n\"Well ... everywhere he would have any call to go.\"\n\nThey stood there, passing the buck silently back and forth between\nthem. At length, Parrish said, \"I'll just look again in his office and\nthe other two rooms, in case he _was_, and slipped out behind me.\"\n\nWestervelt watched him run lightly up the hall to each of the doors.\nParrish's expression, as he returned slowly, was something to behold.\n\n\"I'll go,\" said Westervelt grouchily.\n\nParrish put a hand on his arm.\n\n\"No, that wouldn't look natural. I'll phone Smitty to send one of the\ngirls down.\"\n\n\"Better phone him to send two,\" suggested Westervelt.\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Parrish. \"That's even more natural. Watch the hall while\nI buzz them.\"\n\nHe went into Lydman's office. Westervelt leaned in the laboratory\ndoorway, feeling depressed. After some delay, he sighted Simonetta and\nBeryl turning the far corner with their pocketbooks in hand. Neither\none looked particularly pleased, but their expressions lightened a bit\nat the sight of him.\n\n\"You there, Pete?\" murmured Westervelt.\n\n\"Right at the door,\" whispered Parrish from inside Lydman's office.\n\nThe girls clicked in muffled unison along the hall. Beryl paused at the\nentrance to the ladies' rest room. She raised her eyebrows uncertainly\nat Simonetta. The dark girl threw Westervelt a puzzled shrug, then\npushed past Beryl and went inside. The blonde followed almost on her\nheels.\n\nWestervelt waited. When he thought he could no longer stand it, Parrish\nhissed, \"How long are they in there, Willie?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the youth, \"but maybe we'd better--\"\n\nThe door opened. Simonetta and Beryl walked out, staring quizzically at\nthe two men, who had taken a few steps toward them.\n\n\"What is this gag?\" asked Simonetta. \"There's no one in there. Who\nwould be in there?\"\n\nParrish swore luridly, and none of them seemed to notice.\n\n\"It _can't_ be!\" he exclaimed. \"You're sure?\"\n\n\"Of course we're sure,\" said Beryl.\n\n\"What if the power came on and we didn't notice?\" mused Parrish. \"He\nwouldn't just leave and not tell any of us, would he?\"\n\n\"You know him better than I do,\" commented Beryl. \"I'm beginning to\nwonder, from what you told us on the phone, if he jumped out of a\nwindow somewhere. I know it's a terrible thing to bring up--\"\n\nWestervelt stopped listening to her. He was remembering the draft he\nhad felt, twice now, in the laboratory.\n\n\n\n\nTWENTY\n\n\nWestervelt watched them walk up the hall. He thought of going back into\nthe laboratory to find the open window. In his mind, he could see the\nstraight, twenty-five story drop down the side of the dark tower to the\nroof of the larger part of the building.\n\nHe recalled having looked down once or twice. The people down there had\npaved patios outside their offices. A hurtling body would....\n\nHe shook the thought out of his head and hurried to catch up to Parrish\nand the two girls.\n\nThey trouped into the main office and took turns in telling Smith\nthe story. He flatly refused to believe it for about five minutes.\nUltimately convinced, he told Pauline to check Rosenkrantz by phone\nevery ten minutes.\n\n\"If we're wrong,\" he said, \"it's unfair to have him sitting down there\nall alone. Bob might somehow have outsmarted us, but if he did it to\nthis extent, it means he isn't safe on the loose!\"\n\nWestervelt noticed that Simonetta was looking pale. He wondered about\nhis own features. The eye would probably stand out very picturesquely.\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" he said when the others had all fallen silent.\n\nThey looked at him, hoping to be convinced.\n\n\"He isn't that kind,\" said Westervelt. \"All right, you tell me he had a\nhard time in space and it left him a little off; but this doesn't sound\nlike the direction he would go off in.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Willie?\" asked Smith intently.\n\n\"Well ... maybe he'd run wild. Maybe he'd get desperate and blow\nsomething up. I could see him taking a torch to that door and burning\nanybody that tried to stop him....\"\n\nHe paused as they hung on his words.\n\n\"... but I _can't_ see him quitting!\" said Westervelt. \"If he was that\nkind, he never would have gotten back to Terra, would he?\"\n\nSmith snapped his fingers and looked around.\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" he said. \"I don't know what I was thinking up in my\nimagination. We've all heard Bob utter a threat now and then, when some\nbems out in deep space broke his own private law, but no one ever heard\nhim even hint at suicide.\"\n\nHe grinned ruefully, and added, \"I should have thought of it myself--I\nhad to review his application and examinations when he came to us.\"\n\n\"Some days,\" said Parrish, \"are just too much. Nobody's fault.\"\n\n\"Then, in that case,\" said Westervelt, \"there was one little thing I\nnoticed.\"\n\nHe told them about the open window. Who would keep a window open with\nthe building air-conditioning operating as perfectly as it did?\n\nSmith fell to running his hands through his hair again.\n\n\"Now, let's _think_!\" he muttered. \"There must be some logical\nexplanation.\"\n\n_Logical explanations_, Westervelt thought, _are always the reasons\nother people think of, not me._\n\nHe found a space to sit on the edge of the empty desk. Simonetta leaned\nbeside him, and Beryl wandered over to the window of the switchboard\ncubicle to listen as Pauline checked Rosenkrantz.\n\nShe shook her head to Smith's inquiring look.\n\nThen Lydman strolled through the double doors.\n\n\"What's the conference about?\" he asked.\n\nBeryl let out a shriek. Her back had been to the corridor when she\njumped, but she came down facing the other way.\n\nEveryone stiffened.\n\nLydman stood quietly, regarding them with considerable calm.\n\nAfter a moment, Beryl tottered back to lean against the glass of\nPauline's window. She pressed one hand to her solar plexus, looking as\nif she might fold up at any breath.\n\n\"Oh,\" she gasped. \"Oh, Mr. Lydman....\"\n\nHe examined her with a clinical detachment.\n\n\"Doesn't someone have a tranquilizer for her?\" he asked. \"I don't\nusually scare pretty girls.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no, no ... it's just that ... I mean, everyone was worried\nabout you,\" stammered Beryl.\n\n\"Why?\" asked Lydman. \"Don't you think I can take care of myself?\"\n\nFor the first time, Westervelt noticed the curiously set expression on\nthe ex-spacer's face. He had until then been too busy watching Beryl\nand trying to calm his own nerves. He could not be certain, but it\nseemed as if Lydman's forehead displayed a faint sheen of perspiration.\n\n\"Of course you can, Bob,\" said Smith. \"We were--\"\n\nBeryl, nearly to the point of hysteria in her relief, got the ball away\nfrom him.\n\n\"We were worried about the elevator being stopped,\" she babbled. \"And\nthe door--you'll never believe it, Mr. Lydman, but the door to the\nemergency stairs wouldn't open!\"\n\nWestervelt thought he heard Parrish swear, then realized it had been\nhis own voice. He started to step in front of Simonetta.\n\nParrish was moving slowly in Lydman's direction, trying to look at ease\nbut looking tense instead.\n\n\"Dammit!\" shouted Smith. \"Beryl, you're _fired_!\"\n\nIt did not seem to register on anybody, Beryl least of all. Lydman was\nconfounding them all by standing quietly. His face tightened a little\nmore at the news, but it did not seem to be the expression of a man who\nhad just taken a bad jolt.\n\n\"I know,\" he said. \"I looked at it a couple of times after I saw the\nblackout downstairs.\"\n\nSmith regarded him warily.\n\n\"How do you feel, Bob?\" he asked.\n\n\"You know how I feel,\" said Lydman.\n\nHe let his gaze wander from one to another of them. Westervelt felt a\nchill as the handsome eyes looked through him in turn, but accepted the\ncomforting realization that the stare was about as usual.\n\nBeryl was the picture of a girl afraid to breathe out loud, but the\nothers relaxed cautiously. Smith even planted one hip on the corner of\nSimonetta's desk and tried to look casual.\n\n\"You seem to be doing pretty well,\" he said. \"We were thinking of\nlooking in the lab for something to cut the latch with, but it might\nhave been waste motion. They should be getting the power on any minute\nnow.\"\n\n\"I think....\" Lydman began.\n\n\"Oh, I guess we could find something in the lists,\" pursued Smith. \"If\nyou'd rather we look...?\"\n\n\"I have several things we could use,\" said Lydman.\n\nHe walked into the office proper and looked about for a chair.\nWestervelt stepped back of the center desk and brought him the chair\nof the vacationing secretary. Lydman sat down beside the partition\nscreening the active files opposite Simonetta's desk.\n\n\"In fact,\" continued the ex-space, \"I got them out when I was trying to\nfigure how much that door would stand. Then I decided that would only\nraise a commotion.\"\n\nWestervelt watched him with growing interest. Now that he had the man\nat closer range, he was sure that it was a tremendous effort of will\nthat kept Lydman so relatively calm. The man seemed to be seething\nunderneath his tautly controlled exterior.\n\n\"What did you think of doing?\" asked Smith carefully.\n\n\"Oh, I dug out a better gadget, one that would do _me_ more good,\nanyhow,\" said Lydman. \"It's a little rocket gun attached to a cannister\nof fine wire ladder.\"\n\n\"Wire ladder?\" repeated Smith.\n\n\"Yeah. About six inches wide at the most. I opened a window and shot it\nup to the flight deck. Say--did you know some hijackers stole all three\nof our 'copters?\"\n\n\"Stole all three of....\" Smith's voice dwindled away. When no one else\nbroke the silence, he forced himself to resume. \"Yes, I knew. What I\nwould deeply appreciate, Robert, is your telling me how the hell _you_\nknew!\"\n\nHe finished yelling. Westervelt thought that he looked at least as bad\nas Lydman. Anyone twenty feet away would have completely misjudged them.\n\n\"Just as I said,\" answered Lydman with his tight calm. \"I shot this\nladder to the roof and climbed up.\"\n\n\"You climbed up? _Outside the building?_\"\n\n\"Of course, outside,\" said Lydman, for the first time showing a trace\nof snappishness. \"I couldn't stand it _inside_.\"\n\nHe looked around at them again, surprised that there was the slightest\nhesitation to accept his statement.\n\n\"We'll have to redesign that ladder, though,\" he said. \"It's a mite too\nfine--cuts the hell out of your hands!\"\n\nHe held out his palms. Across each were several welts. One, on his\nright hand, had apparently resumed bleeding stickily since Lydman had\ncome in. He fumbled out a handkerchief with his other hand and blotted\nit.\n\nSmith held his hands to his head.\n\n\"I can't swallow it yet!\" he groaned. \"You feel ... uneasy ... in here,\nso you go out a window ninety-nine floors in the air--\"\n\n\"Only twenty-four above the set-back, really,\" Lydman corrected him.\n\n\"It's enough, isn't it? So you go out, climb up to the helicopter\nroof, and _then_ climb down again and back through the window! And you\npretend to feel better. I would have had a heart attack!\"\n\n\"Who wouldn't?\" said Westervelt.\n\nThe mere conception of what it must have been like made him feel sick.\n\n\"As long as I know it's there,\" muttered Lydman. \"As long as I know\nit's there. I can use that way any time. Just don't anybody pull that\nlittle ladder down.\"\n\n\"Would...?\"\n\nThe meek little syllable came from Beryl, who had now managed to stand\nwithout the support of the partition.\n\nEvery head in the room swiveled to bear upon her. She gulped, and found\npart of her voice.\n\n\"Would there be an old martini lying around in the locker?\" she asked.\n\"I'm afraid to go for it myself because my knees feel as if they'll\ncollapse at the first step.\"\n\nThere was a general outburst of laughter that revealed the enormity of\ntheir relief. Parrish hurried over to put an arm around the blonde, and\nSmith himself went to the locker and opened it.\n\nWith the break in the tension, Beryl managed to walk pretty well,\nperhaps with a little more swagger of the hips than usual, Westervelt\nthought. Smith found a drink for her, and insisted that Lydman have\ntea. The chief pulled the tab himself and held the cup for the few\nseconds required to heat the beverage.\n\nMost of them, like Westervelt, had had too many coffees or sandwiches,\nand were content to sit down and regain their composure. Westervelt was\nmildly surprised to see Parrish take a position behind Lydman and knead\nthe big man's neck muscles to relax him.\n\n\"Did they tell you the news yet?\" asked Smith. \"We got two out--Syssoka\nand Greenhaven!\"\n\n\"No!\" said Lydman, managing a smile. \"Tell me, but if I get up to leave\nin the middle, I'd rather you didn't stop me.\"\n\n\"Nobody is stopping anybody tonight!\" said Smith, and fell to giving\nhis assistant an account of Taranto and Meyers.\n\nWestervelt got up quietly and padded into the switchboard cubbyhole.\n\n\"Lend me your headset, Pauline,\" he murmured, \"and punch Joe's number.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said the little blonde.\n\nShe left the screen off and kissed him behind the ear just as\nRosenkrantz answered.\n\n\"Nothing personal, Willie,\" she giggled. \"I just feel so relieved!\"\n\n\"Who is it now?\" demanded Rosenkrantz's voice. \"You left the lens off,\ndid you know that?\"\n\n\"It's Willie, Joe. He came back and he's sitting down having tea.\"\n\n\"_Back?_ Where was he?\"\n\nWestervelt told him.\n\nThen he told him again and switched off. Joe, he thought, would have to\nlive with it for a while.\n\nWhen he stepped out of the cubicle, everyone was watching Smith\nnarrate, with broad gestures, the flummoxing of the staid authorities\nof Greenhaven. The chief was not above calling upon Parrish for an\nestimate of the charms of Maria Ringstad that caused an outcry among\nthe girls. Lydman smiled politely, but not from the heart. He was still\nquietly reserved.\n\nEveryone was watching Smith. No one paid any attention to the redhaired\nman who drifted into the office area just as Westervelt squirmed past\nPauline and stepped out of the switchboard room.\n\nThe youth blinked at the topcoat over the man's arm. He focused upon\nthe wavy hair and reached for the man's shoulder to turn him around.\n\n\"Charlie Colborn!\" he yelped.\n\nSmith got it first.\n\n\"Well, now,\" he said, standing up. \"If it's getting so everybody and\nhis brother start parading through that door at this time of night, I'm\nleaving! Where's my hat, Si?\"\n\nLydman had caught on almost as quickly, and was on his feet before the\ngeneral whoop went up.\n\n\"I just want to phone my wife,\" said Colborn. \"It's so late I might as\nwell stay here the rest of the night. What's keeping all of you?\"\n\nThey glared at him.\n\n\"The power's been on for fifteen minutes,\" he told them. \"I would have\nbeen up sooner, but that nut of a building manager insisted on running\ntest trips with all the elevators before he'd let anyone come up.\"\n\nLydman had started for the elevator, in shirtsleeves as he was and\ncarrying a cup of tea in one hand and a bloody handkerchief. There was\nno doubt that he meant to go home that way.\n\n\"BOB!\" roared Smith. \"All of you--_listen_!\"\n\nLydman stopped but did not turn around.\n\n\"In the first place, Charlie,\" said Smith, \"you are _not_ going to call\nyour wife from here unless you faithfully give the impression that you\nare all alone. If you slip, I'll swear to her I saw you picked up by\ntwo redheads in a helicopter and you had all the office petty cash with\nyou.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Tell her the traffic was too much. Don't tell her we couldn't get to\nthe street. That goes for everybody else too!\"\n\n\"But ... _why_?\" Colborn got out.\n\n\"Why? You want the D.I.R. boys throwing this up to us every time I try\nto get money out of them for the bare necessities of our operation? We\ncan get people out of dungeons on planets not even in the Galatlas, but\ncan't even escape from our own little hideaway?\"\n\n\"It never happened,\" Parrish agreed quickly.\n\n\"Damn' right!\" said Smith. \"Okay, Bob, push the button! Go with him,\nWillie! You girls--nobody in before noon tomorrow; we have an extra TV\noperator to take care of things.\"\n\n\"Look, I....\" Colborn started to say as he stepped out of Westervelt's\nway.\n\n\"Aw, thanks for phoning in the first place,\" grinned Smith, punching\nhim lightly on the shoulder. \"Wait for me downstairs, Willie! We'll see\nwhat we can do about Harris tomorrow!\"\n\n\"Appoint him an ambassador,\" muttered Westervelt, coming up behind\nLydman as the elevator door slid smoothly open.\n\n_What an outfit!_ he thought to himself. _I'm going to apply for field\nduty, where you can get out among the stars and let someone else figure\nways to keep you out of trouble._\n\nSomehow, incredibly, everyone but Colborn managed to catch the same\nelevator.\n\n\n\n\nEARTHMEN IN TROUBLE\n\nHarris: was caged in an underwater \"zoo\" by a pack of blue lobsters.\n\nMaria: drew a five-year sentence on a puritanical planet for trying to\nbuy a souvenir--and for being excessively feminine.\n\nTaranto & Meyers: had committed the crime of being shipwrecked on a\nplanet that didn't like strangers.\n\nGerson: was simply kidnapped--and nobody had any idea why.\n\nFive citizens of Terra were being held on other worlds--and the\nultra-secret _Department 99_ existed only to set them, and others like\nthem, free.\n\nThis tense novel is the story of one evening's work for Department\n99--their successes and failures--and of the strange crisis that almost\nwrecked\n\nD-99\n\nA PYRAMID BOOK 40c\n\nCover painting by Ralph Brillhart\n\nPrinted in U.S.A.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of D-99, by H.B.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
