It looked insurmountable, that giant palisade with its sheer\ncurtains of solid rock in which bits of quartz winked dazzlingly in the\nsunlight. But the man who was working his tedious way upward was already\nhalfway to the top.\n\nHe came of a race of hillmen, accustomed to scaling forbidding crags,\nand he was a man of unusual strength and agility. His only garment was a\npair of short red silk breeks, and his sandals were slung to his back,\nout of his way, as were his sword and dagger.\n\nThe man was powerfully built, supple as a panther. His skin was bronzed\nby the sun, his square-cut black mane confined by a silver band about\nhis temples. His iron muscles, quick eyes and sure feet served him well\nhere, for it was a climb to test these qualities to the utmost. A\nhundred and fifty feet below him waved the jungle. An equal distance\nabove him the rim of the cliffs was etched against the morning sky.\n\nHe labored like one driven by the necessity of haste; yet he was forced\nto move at a snail's pace, clinging like a fly on a wall. His groping\nhands and feet found niches and knobs, precarious holds at best, and\nsometimes he virtually hung by his finger nails. Yet upward he went,\nclawing, squirming, fighting for every foot. At times he paused to rest\nhis aching muscles, and, shaking the sweat out of his eyes, twisted his\nhead to stare searchingly out over the jungle, combing the green expanse\nfor any trace of human life or motion.\n\nNow the summit was not far above him, and he observed, only a few feet\nabove his head, a break in the sheer stone of the cliff. An instant\nlater he had reached it--a small cavern, just below the edge of the rim.\nAs his head rose above the lip of its floor, he grunted. He clung there,\nhis elbows hooked over the lip. The cave was so tiny that it was little\nmore than a niche cut in the stone, but held an occupant. A shriveled\nmummy, cross-legged, arms folded on the withered breast upon which the\nshrunken head was sunk, sat in the little cavern. The limbs were bound\nin place with rawhide thongs which had become mere rotted wisps. If the\nform had ever been clothed, the ravages of time had long ago reduced the\ngarments to dust. But thrust between the crossed arms and the shrunken\nbreast there was a roll of parchment, yellowed with age to the color of\nold ivory.\n\nThe climber stretched forth a long arm and wrenched away this cylinder.\nWithout investigation he thrust it into his girdle and hauled himself up\nuntil he was standing in the opening of the niche. A spring upward and\nhe caught the rim of the cliffs and pulled himself up and over almost\nwith the same motion.\n\nThere he halted, panting, and stared downward.\n\nIt was like looking into the interior of a vast bowl, rimmed by a\ncircular stone wall. The floor of the bowl was covered with trees and\ndenser vegetation, though nowhere did the growth duplicate the jungle\ndenseness of the outer forest. The cliffs marched around it without a\nbreak and of uniform height. It was a freak of nature, not to be\nparalleled, perhaps, in the whole world: a vast natural amphitheater, a\ncircular bit of forested plain, three or four miles in diameter, cut off\nfrom the rest of the world, and confined within the ring of those\npalisaded cliffs.\n\nBut the man on the cliffs did not devote his thoughts to marveling at\nthe topographical phenomenon. With tense eagerness he searched the\ntree-tops below him, and exhaled a gusty sigh when he caught the glint\nof marble domes amidst the twinkling green. It was no myth, then; below\nhim lay the fabulous and deserted palace of Alkmeenon.\n\nConan the Cimmerian, late of the Baracha Isles, of the Black Coast, and\nof many other climes where life ran wild, had come to the kingdom of\nKeshan following the lure of a fabled treasure that outshone the hoard\nof the Turanian kings.\n\nKeshan was a barbaric kingdom lying in the eastern hinterlands of Kush\nwhere the broad grasslands merge with the forests that roll up from the\nsouth. The people were a mixed race, a dusky nobility ruling a\npopulation that was largely pure negro. The rulers--princes and high\npriests--claimed descent from a white race which, in a mythical age, had\nruled a kingdom whose capital city was Alkmeenon. Conflicting legends\nsought to explain the reason for that race's eventual downfall, and the\nabandonment of the city by the survivors. Equally nebulous were the\ntales of the Teeth of Gwahlur, the treasure of Alkmeenon. But these\nmisty legends had been enough to bring Conan to Keshan, over vast\ndistances of plain, river-laced jungle, and mountains.\n\nHe had found Keshan, which in itself was considered mythical by many\nnorthern and western nations, and he had heard enough to confirm the\nrumors of the treasure that men called the Teeth of Gwahlur. But its\nhiding-place he could not learn, and he was confronted with the\nnecessity of explaining his presence in Keshan. Unattached strangers\nwere not welcome there.\n\nBut he was not nonplussed. With cool assurance he made his offer to the\nstately plumed, suspicious grandees of the barbarically magnificent\ncourt. He was a professional fighting-man. In search of employment (he\nsaid) he had come to Keshan. For a price he would train the armies of\nKeshan and lead them against Punt, their hereditary enemy, whose recent\nsuccesses in the field had aroused the fury of Keshan's irascible king.\n\nThis proposition was not so audacious as it might seem. Conan's fame had\npreceded him, even into distant Keshan; his exploits as a chief of the\nblack corsairs, those wolves of the southern coasts, had made his name\nknown, admired and feared throughout the black kingdoms. He did not\nrefuse tests devised by the dusky lords. Skirmishes along the borders\nwere incessant, affording the Cimmerian plenty of opportunities to\ndemonstrate his ability at hand-to-hand fighting. His reckless ferocity\nimpressed the lords of Keshan, already aware of his reputation as a\nleader of men, and the prospects seemed favorable. All Conan secretly\ndesired was employment to give him legitimate excuse for remaining in\nKeshan long enough to locate the hiding-place of the Teeth of Gwahlur.\nThen there came an interruption. Thutmekri came to Keshan at the head of\nan embassy from Zembabwei.\n\nThutmekri was a Stygian, an adventurer and a rogue whose wits had\nrecommended him to the twin kings of the great hybrid trading kingdom\nwhich lay many days' march to the east. He and the Cimmerian knew each\nother of old, and without love. Thutmekri likewise had a proposition to\nmake to the king of Keshan, and it also concerned the conquest of\nPunt--which kingdom, incidentally, lying east of Keshan, had recently\nexpelled the Zembabwan traders and burned their fortresses.\n\nHis offer outweighed even the prestige of Conan. He pledged himself to\ninvade Punt from the east with a host of black spearmen, Shemitish\narchers, and mercenary swordsmen, and to aid the king of Keshan to annex\nthe hostile kingdom. The benevolent kings of Zembabwei desired only a\nmonopoly of the trade of Keshan and her tributaries--and, as a pledge\nof good faith, some of the Teeth of Gwahlur. These would be put to no\nbase usage. Thutmekri hastened to explain to the suspicious chieftains;\nthey would be placed in the temple of Zembabwei beside the squat gold\nidols of Dagon and Derketo, sacred guests in the holy shrine of the\nkingdom, to seal the covenant between Keshan and Zembabwei. This\nstatement brought a savage grin to Conan's hard lips.\n\nThe Cimmerian made no attempt to match wits and intrigue with Thutmekri\nand his Shemitish partner, Zargheba. He knew that if Thutmekri won his\npoint, he would insist on the instant banishment of his rival. There was\nbut one thing for Conan to do: find the jewels before the king of Keshan\nmade up his mind and flee with them. But by this time he was certain\nthat they were not hidden in Keshia, the royal city which was a swarm of\nthatched huts crowding about a mud wall that enclosed a palace of stone\nand mud and bamboo.\n\nWhile he fumed with nervous impatience, the high priest Gorulga\nannounced that before any decision could be reached, the will of the\ngods must be ascertained concerning the proposed alliance with Zembabwei\nand the pledge of objects long held holy and inviolate. The oracle of\nAlkmeenon must be consulted.\n\nThis was an awesome thing, and it caused tongues to wag excitedly in\npalace and bee-hive hut. Not for a century had the priests visited the\nsilent city. The oracle, men said, was the Princess Yelaya, the last\nruler of Alkmeenon, who had died in the full bloom of her youth and\nbeauty, and whose body had miraculously remained unblemished throughout\nthe ages. Of old, priests had made their way into the haunted city, and\nshe had taught them wisdom. The last priest to seek the oracle had been\na wicked man, who had sought to steal for himself the curiously cut\njewels that men called the Teeth of Gwahlur. But some doom had come upon\nhim in the deserted palace, from which his acolytes, fleeing, had told\ntales of horror that had for a hundred years frightened the priests from\nthe city and the oracle.\n\nBut Gorulga, the present high priest, as one confident in his knowledge\nof his own integrity, announced that he would go with a handful of\nfollowers to revive the ancient custom. And in the excitement tongues\nbuzzed indiscreetly, and Conan caught the clue for which he had sought\nfor weeks--the overheard whisper of a lesser priest that sent the\nCimmerian stealing out of Keshia the night before the dawn when the\npriests were to start.\n\nRiding as hard as he dared for a night and a day and a night, he came in\nthe early dawn to the cliffs of Alkmeenon, which stood in the\nsouthwestern corner of the kingdom, amidst uninhabited jungle which was\ntaboo to common men. None but the priests dared approach the haunted\nvale within a distance of many miles. And not even a priest had entered\nAlkmeenon for a hundred years.\n\nNo man had ever climbed these cliffs, legends said, and none but the\npriests knew the secret entrance into the valley. Conan did not waste\ntime looking for it. Steeps that balked these people, horsemen and\ndwellers of plain and level forest, were not impossible for a man born\nin the rugged hills of Cimmeria.\n\nNow on the summit of the cliffs he looked down into the circular valley\nand wondered what plague, war or superstition had driven the members of\nthat ancient race forth from their stronghold to mingle with and be\nabsorbed by the tribes that hemmed them in.\n\nThis valley had been their citadel. There the palace stood, and there\nonly the royal family and their court dwelt. The real city stood outside\nthe cliffs. Those waving masses of green jungle vegetation hid its\nruins. But the domes that glistened in the leaves below him were the\nunbroken pinnacles of the royal palace of Alkmeenon which had defied the\ncorroding ages.\n\nSwinging a leg over the rim he went down swiftly. The inner side of the\ncliffs was more broken, not quite so sheer. In less than half the time\nit had taken him to ascend the outer side, he dropped to the swarded\nvalley floor.\n\nWith one hand on his sword, he looked alertly about him. There was no\nreason to suppose men lied when they said that Alkmeenon was empty and\ndeserted, haunted only by the ghosts of the dead past. But it was\nConan's nature to be suspicious and wary. The silence was primordial;\nnot even a leaf quivered on a branch. When he bent to peer under the\ntrees, he saw nothing but the marching rows of trunks, receding and\nreceding into the blue gloom of the deep woods.\n\nNevertheless he went warily, sword in hand, his restless eyes combing\nthe shadows from side to side, his springy tread making no sound on the\nsward. All about him he saw signs of an ancient civilization; marble\nfountains, voiceless and crumbling, stood in circles of slender trees\nwhose patterns were too symmetrical to have been a chance of nature.\nForest-growth and underbrush had invaded the evenly planned groves, but\ntheir outlines were still visible. Broad pavements ran away under the\ntrees, broken, and with grass growing through the wide cracks. He\nglimpsed walls with ornamental copings, lattices of carven stone that\nmight once have served as the walls of pleasure pavilions.\n\nAhead of him, through the trees, the domes gleamed and the bulk of the\nstructure supporting them became more apparent as he advanced.\nPresently, pushing through a screen of vine-tangled branches, he came\ninto a comparatively open space where the trees straggled, unencumbered\nby undergrowth, and saw before him the wide, pillared portico of the\npalace.\n\nAs he mounted the broad marble steps, he noted that the building was in\nfar better state of preservation than the lesser structures he had\nglimpsed. The thick walls and massive pillars seemed too powerful to\ncrumble before the assault of time and the elements. The same enchanted\nquiet brooded over all. The cat-like pad of his sandaled feet seemed\nstartlingly loud in the stillness.\n\nSomewhere in this palace lay the effigy or image which had in times past\nserved as oracle for the priests of Keshan. And somewhere in the palace,\nunless that indiscreet priest had babbled a lie, was hidden the treasure\nof the forgotten kings of Alkmeenon.\n\nConan passed into a broad, lofty hall, lined with tall columns, between\nwhich arches gaped, their door long rotted away. He traversed this in a\ntwilight dimness, and at the other end passed through great\ndouble-valved bronze doors which stood partly open, as they might have\nstood for centuries. He emerged into a vast domed chamber which must\nhave served as audience hall for the kings of Alkmeenon.\n\nIt was octagonal in shape, and the great dome up to which the lofty\nceiling curved obviously was cunningly pierced, for the chamber was much\nbetter lighted than the hall which led to it. At the farther side of the\ngreat room there rose a dais with broad lapis-lazuli steps leading up to\nit, and on that dais there stood a massive chair with ornate arms and a\nhigh back which once doubtless supported a cloth-of-gold canopy. Conan\ngrunted explosively and his eyes lit. The golden throne of Alkmeenon,\nnamed in immemorial legendry! He weighed it with a practised eye. It\nrepresented a fortune in itself, if he were but able to bear it away.\nIts richness fired his imagination concerning the treasure itself, and\nmade him burn with eagerness. His fingers itched to plunge among the\ngems he had heard described by story-tellers in the market squares of\nKeshia, who repeated tales handed down from mouth to mouth through the\ncenturies--jewels not to be duplicated in the world, rubies, emeralds,\ndiamonds, bloodstones, opals, sapphires, the loot of the ancient world.\n\nHe had expected to find the oracle-effigy seated on the throne, but\nsince it was not, it was probably placed in some other part of the\npalace, if, indeed, such a thing really existed. But since he had turned\nhis face toward Keshan, so many myths had proved to be realities that he\ndid not doubt that he would find some kind of image or god.\n\nBehind the throne there was a narrow arched doorway which doubtless had\nbeen masked by hangings in the days of Alkmeenon's life. He glanced\nthrough it and saw that it let into an alcove, empty, and with a narrow\ncorridor leading off from it at right angles. Turning away from it, he\nspied another arch to the left of the dais, and it, unlike the others,\nwas furnished with a door. Nor was it any common door. The portal was of\nthe same rich metal as the throne, and carved with many curious\narabesques.\n\nAt his touch it swung open so readily that its hinges might recently\nhave been oiled. Inside he halted, staring.\n\nHe was in a square chamber of no great dimensions, whose marble walls\nrose to an ornate ceiling, inlaid with gold. Gold friezes ran about the\nbase and the top of the walls, and there was no door other than the one\nthrough which he had entered. But he noted these details mechanically.\nHis whole attention was centered on the shape which lay on an ivory dais\nbefore him.\n\nHe had expected an image, probably carved with the skill of a forgotten\nart. But no art could mimic the perfection of the figure that lay before\nhim.\n\nIt was no effigy of stone or metal or ivory. It was the actual body of a\nwoman, and by what dark art the ancients had preserved that form\nunblemished for so many ages Conan could not even guess. The very\ngarments she wore were intact--and Conan scowled at that, a vague\nuneasiness stirring at the back of his mind. The arts that preserved the\nbody should not have affected the garments. Yet there they were--gold\nbreast-plates set with concentric circles of small gems, gilded sandals,\nand a short silken skirt upheld by a jeweled girdle. Neither cloth nor\nmetal showed any signs of decay.\n\nYelaya was coldly beautiful, even in death. Her body was like alabaster,\nslender yet voluptuous; a great crimson jewel gleamed against the darkly\npiled foam of her hair.\n\nConan stood frowning down at her, and then tapped the dais with his\nsword. Possibilities of a hollow containing the treasure occurred to\nhim, but the dais rang solid. He turned and paced the chamber in some\nindecision. Where should he search first, in the limited time at his\ndisposal? The priest he had overheard babbling to a courtesan had said\nthe treasure was hidden in the palace. But that included a space of\nconsiderable vastness. He wondered if he should hide himself until the\npriests had come and gone, and then renew the search. But there was a\nstrong chance that they might take the jewels with them when they\nreturned to Keshia. For he was convinced that Thutmekri had corrupted\nGorulga.\n\nConan could predict Thutmekri's plans from his knowledge of the man. He\nknew that it had been Thutmekri who had proposed the conquest of Punt to\nthe kings of Zembabwei, which conquest was but one move toward their\nreal goal--the capture of the Teeth of Gwahlur. Those wary kings would\ndemand proof that the treasure really existed before they made any\nmove. The jewels Thutmekri asked as a pledge would furnish that proof.\n\nWith positive evidence of the treasure's reality, the kings of Zembabwei\nwould move. Punt would be invaded simultaneously from the east and the\nwest, but the Zembabwans would see to it that the Keshani did most of\nthe fighting, and then, when both Punt and Keshan were exhausted from\nthe struggle the Zembabwans would crush both races, loot Keshan and take\nthe treasure by force, if they had to destroy every building and torture\nevery living human in the kingdom.\n\nBut there was always another possibility: if Thutmekri could get his\nhands on the hoard, it would be characteristic of the man to cheat his\nemployers, steal the jewels for himself and decamp, leaving the\nZembabwan emissaries holding the sack.\n\nConan believed that this consulting of the oracle was but a ruse to\npersuade the king of Keshan to accede to Thutmekri's wishes--for he\nnever for a moment doubted that Gorulga was as subtle and devious as all\nthe rest mixed up in this grand swindle. Conan had not approached the\nhigh priest himself, because in the game of bribery he would have no\nchance against Thutmekri, and to attempt it would be to play directly\ninto the Stygian's hands. Gorulga could denounce the Cimmerian to the\npeople, establish a reputation for integrity, and rid Thutmekri of his\nrival at one stroke. He wondered how Thutmekri had corrupted the high\npriest, and just what could be offered as a bribe to a man who had the\ngreatest treasure in the world under his fingers.\n\nAt any rate he was sure that the oracle would be made to say that the\ngods willed it that Keshan should follow Thutmekri's wishes, and he was\nsure, too, that it would drop a few pointed remarks concerning himself.\nAfter that Keshia would be too hot for the Cimmerian, nor had Conan had\nany intention of returning when he rode away in the night.\n\nThe oracle chamber held no clue for him. He went forth into the great\nthrone-room and laid his hands on the throne. It was heavy, but he could\ntilt it up. The floor beneath, a thick marble dais, was solid. Again he\nsought the alcove. His mind clung to a secret crypt near the oracle.\nPainstakingly he began to tap along the walls, and presently his taps\nrang hollow at a spot opposite the mouth of the narrow corridor. Looking\nmore closely he saw that the crack between the marble panel at that\npoint and the next was wider than usual. He inserted a dagger-point and\npried.\n\nSilently the panel swung open, revealing a niche in the wall, but\nnothing else. He swore feelingly. The aperture was empty, and it did not\nlook as if it had ever served as a crypt for treasure. Leaning into the\nniche he saw a system of tiny holes in the wall, about on a level with\na man's mouth. He peered through, and grunted understandingly. That was\nthe wall that formed the partition between the alcove and the oracle\nchamber. Those holes had not been visible in the chamber. Conan grinned.\nThis explained the mystery of the oracle, but it was a bit cruder than\nhe had expected. Gorulga would plant either himself or some trusted\nminion in that niche, to talk through the holes, and the credulous\nacolytes would accept it as the veritable voice of Yelaya.\n\nRemembering something, the Cimmerian drew forth the roll of parchment he\nhad taken from the mummy and unrolled it carefully, as it seemed ready\nto fall to pieces with age. He scowled over the dim characters with\nwhich it was covered. In his roaming about the world the giant\nadventurer had picked up a wide smattering of knowledge, particularly\nincluding the speaking and reading of many alien tongues. Many a\nsheltered scholar would have been astonished at the Cimmerian's\nlinguistic abilities, for he had experienced many adventures where\nknowledge of a strange language had meant the difference between life\nand death.\n\nThese characters were puzzling, at once familiar and unintelligible, and\npresently he discovered the reason. They were the characters of archaic\nPelishtim, which possessed many points of difference from the modern\nscript, with which he was familiar, and which, three centuries ago, had\nbeen modified by conquest by a nomad tribe. This older, purer script\nbaffled him. He made out a recurrent phrase, however, which he\nrecognized as a proper name: B\u00eet-Yakin. He gathered that it was the name\nof the writer.\n\nScowling, his lips unconsciously moving as he struggled with the task,\nhe blundered through the manuscript, finding much of it untranslatable\nand most of the rest of it obscure.\n\nHe gathered that the writer, the mysterious B\u00eet-Yakin, had come from\nafar with his servants, and entered the valley of Alkmeenon. Much that\nfollowed was meaningless, interspersed as it was with unfamiliar phrases\nand characters. Such as he could translate seemed to indicate the\npassing of a very long period of time. The name of Yelaya was repeated\nfrequently, and toward the last part of the manuscript it became\napparent that B\u00eet-Yakin knew that death was upon him. With a slight\nstart Conan realized that the mummy in the cavern must be the remains of\nthe writer of the manuscript, the mysterious Pelishtim, B\u00eet-Yakin. The\nman had died, as he had prophesied, and his servants, obviously, had\nplaced him in that open crypt, high up on the cliffs, according to his\ninstructions before his death.\n\nIt was strange that B\u00eet-Yakin was not mentioned in any of the legends of\nAlkmeenon. Obviously he had come to the valley after it had been\ndeserted by the original inhabitants--the manuscript indicated as\nmuch--but it seemed peculiar that the priests who came in the old days\nto consult the oracle had not seen the man or his servants. Conan felt\nsure that the mummy and this parchment were more than a hundred years\nold. B\u00eet-Yakin had dwelt in the valley when the priests came of old to\nbow before dead Yelaya. Yet concerning him the legends were silent,\ntelling only of a deserted city, haunted only by the dead.\n\nWhy had the man dwelt in this desolate spot, and to what unknown\ndestination had his servants departed after disposing of their master's\ncorpse?\n\nConan shrugged his shoulders and thrust the parchment back into his\ngirdle--he started violently, the skin on the backs of his hands\ntingling. Startlingly, shockingly in the slumberous stillness, there had\nboomed the deep strident clangor of a great gong!\n\nHe wheeled, crouching like a great cat, sword in hand, glaring down the\nnarrow corridor from which the sound had seemed to come. Had the priests\nof Keshia arrived? This was improbable, he knew; they would not have had\ntime to reach the valley. But that gong was indisputable evidence of\nhuman presence.\n\nConan was basically a direct-actionist. Such subtlety as he possessed\nhad been acquired through contact with the more devious races. When\ntaken off guard by some unexpected occurrence, he reverted instinctively\nto type. So now, instead of hiding or slipping away in the opposite\ndirection as the average man might have done, he ran straight down the\ncorridor in the direction of the sound. His sandals made no more sound\nthan the pads of a panther would have made; his eyes were slits, his\nlips unconsciously asnarl. Panic had momentarily touched his soul at the\nshock of that unexpected reverberation, and the red rage of the\nprimitive that is wakened by threat of peril always lurked close to the\nsurface of the Cimmerian.\n\nHe emerged presently from the winding corridor into a small open court.\nSomething glinting in the sun caught his eye. It was the gong, a great\ngold disk, hanging from a gold arm extending from the crumbling wall. A\nbrass mallet lay near, but there was no sound or sight of humanity. The\nsurrounding arches gaped emptily. Conan crouched inside the doorway for\nwhat seemed a long time. There was no sound or movement throughout the\ngreat palace. His patience exhausted at last, he glided around the curve\nof the court, peering into the arches, ready to leap either way like a\nflash of light, or to strike right or left as a cobra strikes.\n\nHe reached the gong, stared into the arch nearest it. He saw only a dim\nchamber, littered with the debris of decay. Beneath the gong the\npolished marble flags showed no footprints, but there was a scent in the\nair--a faintly fetid odor he could not classify; his nostrils dilated\nlike those of a wild beast as he sought in vain to identify it.\n\nHe turned toward the arch--with appalling suddenness the seemingly solid\nflags splintered and gave way under his feet. Even as he fell he spread\nwide his arms and caught the edges of the aperture that gaped beneath\nhim. The edges crumbled off under his clutching fingers. Down into utter\ndarkness he shot, into black icy water that gripped him and whirled him\naway with breathless speed.\n\n\n\n\n2 A Goddess Awakens\n\n\nThe Cimmerian at first made no attempt to fight the current that was\nsweeping him through lightless night. He kept himself afloat, gripping\nbetween his teeth the sword, which he had not relinquished, even in his\nfall, and did not even seek to guess to what doom he was being borne.\nBut suddenly a beam of light lanced the darkness ahead of him. He saw\nthe surging, seething black surface of the water, in turmoil as if\ndisturbed by some monster of the deep, and he saw the sheer stone walls\nof the channel curved up to a vault overhead. On each side ran a narrow\nledge, just below the arching roof, but they were far out of his reach.\nAt one point this roof had been broken, probably fallen in, and the\nlight was streaming through the aperture. Beyond that shaft of light was\nutter blackness, and panic assailed the Cimmerian as he saw he would be\nswept on past that spot of light, and into the unknown blackness again.\n\nThen he saw something else: bronze ladders extended from the ledges to\nthe water's surface at regular intervals, and there was one just ahead\nof him. Instantly he struck out for it, fighting the current that would\nhave held him to the middle of the stream. It dragged at him as with\ntangible, animate slimy hands, but he buffeted the rushing surge with\nthe strength of desperation and now drew closer and closer inshore,\nfighting furiously for every inch. Now he was even with the ladder and\nwith a fierce, gasping plunge he gripped the bottom rung and hung on,\nbreathless.\n\nA few seconds later he struggled up out of the seething water, trusting\nhis weight dubiously to the corroded rungs. They sagged and bent, but\nthey held, and he clambered up onto the narrow ledge which ran along the\nwall scarcely a man's length below the curving roof. The tall Cimmerian\nwas forced to bend his head as he stood up. A heavy bronze door showed\nin the stone at a point even with the head of the ladder, but it did not\ngive to Conan's efforts. He transferred his sword from his teeth to its\nscabbard, spitting blood--for the edge had cut his lips in that fierce\nfight with the river--and turned his attention to the broken roof.\n\nHe could reach his arms up through the crevice and grip the edge, and\ncareful testing told him it would bear his weight. An instant later he\nhad drawn himself up through the hole, and found himself in a wide\nchamber, in a state of extreme disrepair. Most of the roof had fallen\nin, as well as a great section of the floor, which was laid over the\nvault of a subterranean river. Broken arches opened into other chambers\nand corridors, and Conan believed he was still in the great palace. He\nwondered uneasily how many chambers in that palace had underground water\ndirectly under them, and when the ancient flags or tiles might give way\nagain and precipitate him back into the current from which he had just\ncrawled.\n\nAnd he wondered just how much of an accident that fall had been. Had\nthose rotten flags simply chanced to give way beneath his weight, or was\nthere a more sinister explanation? One thing at least was obvious: he\nwas not the only living thing in that palace. That gong had not sounded\nof its own accord, whether the noise had been meant to lure him to his\ndeath, or not. The silence of the palace became suddenly sinister,\nfraught with crawling menace.\n\nCould it be someone on the same mission as himself? A sudden thought\noccurred to him, at the memory of the mysterious B\u00eet-Yakin. Was it not\npossible that this man had found the Teeth of Gwahlur in his long\nresidence in Alkmeenon--that his servants had taken them with them when\nthey departed? The possibility that he might be following a\nwill-o'-the-wisp infuriated the Cimmerian.\n\nChoosing a corridor which he believed led back toward the part of the\npalace he had first entered, he hurried along it, stepping gingerly as\nhe thought of that black river that seethed and foamed somewhere below\nhis feet.\n\nHis speculations recurrently revolved about the oracle chamber and its\ncryptic occupant. Somewhere in that vicinity must be the clue to the\nmystery of the treasure, if indeed it still remained in its immemorial\nhiding-place.\n\nThe great palace lay silent as ever, disturbed only by the swift passing\nof his sandaled feet. The chambers and halls he traversed were crumbling\ninto ruin, but as he advanced the ravages of decay became less apparent.\nHe wondered briefly for what purpose the ladders had been suspended from\nthe ledges over the subterranean river, but dismissed the matter with a\nshrug. He was little interested in speculating over unremunerative\nproblems of antiquity.\n\nHe was not sure just where the oracle chamber lay, from where he was,\nbut presently he emerged into a corridor which led back into the great\nthrone-room under one of the arches. He had reached a decision; it was\nuseless for him to wander aimlessly about the palace, seeking the hoard.\nHe would conceal himself somewhere here, wait until the Keshani priests\ncame, and then, after they had gone through the farce of consulting the\noracle, he would follow them to the hiding-place of the gems, to which\nhe was certain they would go. Perhaps they would take only a few of the\njewels with them. He would content himself with the rest.\n\nDrawn by a morbid fascination, he re-entered the oracle chamber and\nstared down again at the motionless figure of the princess who was\nworshipped as a goddess, entranced by her frigid beauty. What cryptic\nsecret was locked in that marvelously molded form?\n\nHe started violently. The breath sucked through his teeth, the short\nhairs prickled at the back of his scalp. The body still lay as he had\nfirst seen it, silent, motionless, in breast-plates of jeweled gold,\ngilded sandals and silken shirt. But now there was a subtle difference.\nThe lissom limbs were not rigid, a peach-bloom touched the cheeks, the\nlips were red--\n\nWith a panicky curse Conan ripped out his sword.\n\n'Crom! She's alive!'\n\nAt his words the long dark lashes lifted; the eyes opened and gaped up\nat him inscrutably, dark, lustrous, mystical. He glared in frozen\nspeechlessness.\n\nShe sat up with a supple ease, still holding his ensorceled stare.\n\nHe licked his dry lips and found voice.\n\n'You--are--are you Yelaya?' he stammered.\n\n'I am Yelaya!' The voice was rich and musical, and he stared with new\nwonder. 'Do not fear. I will not harm you if you do my bidding.'\n\n'How can a dead woman come to life after all these centuries?' he\ndemanded, as if skeptical of what his senses told him. A curious gleam\nwas beginning to smolder in his eyes.\n\nShe lifted her arms in a mystical gesture.\n\n'I am a goddess. A thousand years ago there descended upon me the curse\nof the greater gods, the gods of darkness beyond the borders of light.\nThe mortal in me died; the goddess in me could never die. Here I have\nlain for so many centuries, to awaken each night at sunset and hold my\ncourt as of yore, with specters drawn from the shadows of the past. Man,\nif you would not view that which will blast your soul for ever, get\nhence quickly! I command you! Go!' The voice became imperious, and her\nslender arm lifted and pointed.\n\nConan, his eyes burning slits, slowly sheathed his sword, but he did not\nobey her order. He stepped closer, as if impelled by a powerful\nfascination--without the slightest warning he grabbed her up in a\nbear-like grasp. She screamed a very ungoddess-like scream, and there\nwas a sound of ripping silk, as with one ruthless wrench he tore off her\nskirt.\n\n'Goddess! Ha!' His bark was full of angry contempt. He ignored the\nfrantic writhings of his captive. 'I thought it was strange that a\nprincess of Alkmeenon would speak with a Corinthian accent! As soon as\nI'd gathered my wits I knew I'd seen you somewhere. You're Muriela,\nZargheba's Corinthian dancing-girl. This crescent-shaped birthmark on\nyour hip proves it. I saw it once when Zargheba was whipping you.\nGoddess! Bah!' He smacked the betraying hip contemptuously and\nresoundingly with his open hand, and the girl yelped piteously.\n\nAll her imperiousness had gone out of her. She was no longer a mystical\nfigure of antiquity, but a terrified and humiliated dancing-girl, such\nas can be bought at almost any Shemitish market-place. She lifted up her\nvoice and wept unashamedly. Her captor glared down at her with angry\ntriumph.\n\n'Goddess! Ha! So you were one of the veiled women Zargheba brought to\nKeshia with him. Did you think you could fool me, you little idiot? A\nyear ago I saw you in Akbitana with that swine, Zargheba, and I don't\nforget faces--or women's figures. I think I'll--'\n\nSquirming about in his grasp she threw her slender arms about his\nmassive neck in an abandon of terror; tears coursed down her cheeks, and\nher sobs quivered with a note of hysteria.\n\n'Oh, please don't hurt me! Don't! I had to do it! Zargheba brought me\nhere to act as the oracle!'\n\n'Why, you sacrilegious little hussy!' rumbled Conan. 'Do you not fear\nthe gods? Crom! is there no honesty anywhere?'\n\n'Oh, please!' she begged, quivering with abject fright. 'I couldn't\ndisobey Zargheba. Oh, what shall I do? I shall be cursed by these\nheathen gods!'\n\n'What do you think the priests will do to you if they find out you're an\nimpostor?' he demanded.\n\nAt the thought her legs refused to support her, and she collapsed in a\nshuddering heap, clasping Conan's knees and mingling incoherent pleas\nfor mercy and protection with piteous protestations of her innocence of\nany malign intention. It was a vivid change from her pose as the ancient\nprincess, but not surprising. The fear that had nerved her then was now\nher undoing.\n\n'Where is Zargheba?' he demanded. 'Stop yammering, damn it, and answer\nme.'\n\n'Outside the palace,' she whimpered, 'watching for the priests.'\n\n'How many men with him?'\n\n'None. We came alone.'\n\n'Ha!' It was much like the satisfied grunt of a hunting lion. 'You must\nhave left Keshia a few hours after I did. Did you climb the cliffs?'\n\nShe shook her head, too choked with tears to speak coherently. With an\nimpatient imprecation he seized her slim shoulders and shook her until\nshe gasped for breath.\n\n'Will you quit that blubbering and answer me? How did you get into the\nvalley?'\n\n'Zargheba knew the secret way,' she gasped. 'The priest Gwarunga told\nhim, and Thutmekri. On the south side of the valley there is a broad\npool lying at the foot of the cliffs. There is a cave-mouth under the\nsurface of the water that is not visible to the casual glance. We ducked\nunder the water and entered it. The cave slopes up out of the water\nswiftly and leads through the cliffs. The opening on the side of the\nvalley is masked by heavy thickets.'\n\n'I climbed the cliffs on the east side,' he muttered. 'Well, what then?'\n\n'We came to the palace and Zargheba hid me among the trees while he went\nto look for the chamber of the oracle. I do not think he fully trusted\nGwarunga. While he was gone I thought I heard a gong sound, but I was\nnot sure. Presently Zargheba came and took me into the palace and\nbrought me to this chamber, where the goddess Yelaya lay upon the dais.\nHe stripped the body and clothed me in the garments and ornaments. Then\nhe went forth to hide the body and watch for the priests. I have been\nafraid. When you entered I wanted to leap up and beg you to take me away\nfrom this place, but I feared Zargheba. When you discovered I was alive,\nI thought I could frighten you away.'\n\n'What were you to say as the oracle?' he asked.\n\n'I was to bid the priests to take the Teeth of Gwahlur and give some of\nthem to Thutmekri as a pledge, as he desired, and place the rest in the\npalace at Keshia. I was to tell them that an awful doom threatened\nKeshan if they did not agree to Thutmekri's proposals. And, oh, yes, I\nwas to tell them that you were to be skinned alive immediately.'\n\n'Thutmekri wanted the treasure where he--or the Zembabwans--could lay\nhand on it easily,' muttered Conan, disregarding the remark concerning\nhimself. 'I'll carve his liver yet--Gorulga is a party to this swindle,\nof course?'\n\n'No. He believes in his gods, and is incorruptible. He knows nothing\nabout this. He will obey the oracle. It was all Thutmekri's plan.\nKnowing the Keshani would consult the oracle, he had Zargheba bring me\nwith the embassy from Zembabwei, closely veiled and secluded.'\n\n'Well, I'm damned!' muttered Conan. 'A priest who honestly believes in\nhis oracle, and can not be bribed. Crom! I wonder if it was Zargheba who\nbanged that gong. Did he know I was here? Could he have known about\nthat rotten flagging? Where is he now, girl?'\n\n'Hiding in a thicket of lotus trees, near the ancient avenue that leads\nfrom the south wall of the cliffs to the palace,' she answered. Then she\nrenewed her importunities. 'Oh, Conan, have pity on me! I am afraid of\nthis evil, ancient place. I know I have heard stealthy footfalls padding\nabout me--oh, Conan, take me away with you! Zargheba will kill me when I\nhave served his purpose here--I know it! The priests, too, will kill me\nif they discover my deceit.\n\n'He is a devil--he bought me from a slave-trader who stole me out of a\ncaravan bound through southern Koth, and has made me the tool of his\nintrigues ever since. Take me away from him! You can not be as cruel as\nhe. Don't leave me to be slain here! Please! Please!'\n\nShe was on her knees, clutching at Conan hysterically, her beautiful\ntear-stained face upturned to him, her dark silken hair flowing in\ndisorder over her white shoulders. Conan picked her up and set her on\nhis knee.\n\n'Listen to me. I'll protect you from Zargheba. The priests shall not\nknow of your perfidy. But you've got to do as I tell you.'\n\nShe faltered promises of explicit obedience, clasping his corded neck as\nif seeking security from the contact.\n\n'Good. When the priests come, you'll act the part of Yelaya, as Zargheba\nplanned--it'll be dark, and in the torchlight they'll never know the\ndifference. But you'll say this to them: \"It is the will of the gods\nthat the Stygian and his Shemitish dogs be driven from Keshan. They are\nthieves and traitors who plot to rob the gods. Let the Teeth of Gwahlur\nbe placed in the care of the general Conan. Let him lead the armies of\nKeshan. He is beloved of the gods.\"'\n\nShe shivered, with an expression of desperation, but acquiesced.\n\n'But Zargheba?' she cried. 'He'll kill me!'\n\n'Don't worry about Zargheba,' he grunted. 'I'll take care of that dog.\nYou do as I say. Here, put up your hair again. It's fallen all over your\nshoulders. And the gem's fallen out of it.'\n\nHe replaced the great glowing gem himself, nodding approval.\n\n'It's worth a room full of slaves, itself alone. Here, put your skirt\nback on. It's torn down the side, but the priests will never notice it.\nWipe your face. A goddess doesn't cry like a whipped schoolgirl. By\nCrom, you do look like Yelaya, face, hair, figure and all! If you act\nthe goddess with the priests as well as you did with me, you'll fool\nthem easily.'\n\n'I'll try,' she shivered.\n\n'Good; I'm going to find Zargheba.'\n\nAt that she became panicky again.\n\n'No! Don't leave me alone! This place is haunted!'\n\n'There's nothing here to harm you,' he assured her impatiently. 'Nothing\nbut Zargheba, and I'm going to look after him. I'll be back shortly.\nI'll be watching from close by in case anything goes wrong during the\nceremony; but if you play your part properly, nothing will go wrong.'\n\nAnd turning, he hastened out of the oracle chamber; behind him Muriela\nsqueaked wretchedly at his going.\n\nTwilight had fallen. The great rooms and halls were shadowy and\nindistinct; copper friezes glinted dully through the dusk. Conan strode\nlike a silent phantom through the great halls, with a sensation of being\nstared at from the shadowed recesses by invisible ghosts of the past. No\nwonder the girl was nervous amid such surroundings.\n\nHe glided down the marble steps like a slinking panther, sword in hand.\nSilence reigned over the valley, and above the rim of the cliffs stars\nwere blinking out. If the priests of Keshia had entered the valley there\nwas not a sound, not a movement in the greenery to betray them. He made\nout the ancient broken-paved avenue, wandering away to the south, lost\namid clustering masses of fronds and thick-leaved bushes. He followed it\nwarily, hugging the edge of the paving where the shrubs massed their\nshadows thickly, until he saw ahead of him, dimly in the dusk, the clump\nof lotus-trees, the strange growth peculiar to the black lands of Kush.\nThere, according to the girl, Zargheba should be lurking. Conan became\nstealth personified. A velvet-footed shadow, he melted into the\nthickets.\n\nHe approached the lotus grove by a circuitous movement, and scarcely the\nrustle of a leaf proclaimed his passing. At the edge of the trees he\nhalted suddenly, crouched like a suspicious panther among the deep\nshrubs. Ahead of him, among the dense leaves, showed a pallid oval, dim\nin the uncertain light. It might have been one of the great white\nblossoms which shone thickly among the branches. But Conan knew that it\nwas a man's face. And it was turned toward him. He shrank quickly deeper\ninto the shadows. Had Zargheba seen him? The man was looking directly\ntoward him. Seconds passed. That dim face had not moved. Conan could\nmake out the dark tuft below that was the short black beard.\n\nAnd suddenly Conan was aware of something unnatural. Zargheba, he knew,\nwas not a tall man. Standing erect, his head would scarcely top the\nCimmerian's shoulder; yet that face was on a level with Conan's own. Was\nthe man standing on something? Conan bent and peered toward the ground\nbelow the spot where the face showed, but his vision was blocked by\nundergrowth and the thick boles of the trees. But he saw something else,\nand he stiffened. Through a slot in the underbrush he glimpsed the stem\nof the tree under which, apparently, Zargheba was standing. The face\nwas directly in line with that tree. He should have seen below that\nface, not the tree-trunk, but Zargheba's body--but there was no body\nthere.\n\nSuddenly tenser than a tiger who stalks his prey, Conan glided deeper\ninto the thicket, and a moment later drew aside a leafy branch and\nglared at the face that had not moved. Nor would it ever move again, of\nits own volition. He looked on Zargheba's severed head, suspended from\nthe branch of the tree by its own long black hair.\n\n\n\n\n3 The Return of the Oracle\n\n\nConan wheeled supplely, sweeping the shadows with a fiercely questing\nstare. There was no sign of the murdered man's body; only yonder the\ntall lush grass was trampled and broken down and the sward was dabbled\ndarkly and wetly. Conan stood scarcely breathing as he strained his ears\ninto the silence. The trees and bushes with their great pallid blossoms\nstood dark, still and sinister, etched against the deepening dusk.\n\nPrimitive fears whispered at the back of Conan's mind. Was this the work\nof the priests of Keshan? If so, where were they? Was it Zargheba, after\nall, who had struck the gong? Again there rose the memory of B\u00eet-Yakin\nand his mysterious servants. B\u00eet-Yakin was dead, shriveled to a hulk of\nwrinkled leather and bound in his hollowed crypt to greet the rising sun\nfor ever. But the servants of B\u00eet-Yakin were unaccounted for. There was\nno proof they had ever left the valley.\n\nConan thought of the girl, Muriela, alone and unguarded in that great\nshadowy palace. He wheeled and ran back down the shadowed avenue, and he\nran as a suspicious panther runs, poised even in full stride to whirl\nright or left and strike death blows.\n\nThe palace loomed through the trees, and he saw something else--the glow\nof fire reflecting redly from the polished marble. He melted into the\nbushes that lined the broken street, glided through the dense growth and\nreached the edge of the open space before the portico. Voices reached\nhim; torches bobbed and their flare shone on glossy ebon shoulders. The\npriests of Keshan had come.\n\nThey had not advanced up the wide, overgrown avenue as Zargheba had\nexpected them to do. Obviously there was more than one secret way into\nthe valley of Alkmeenon.\n\nThey were filing up the broad marble steps, holding their torches high.\nHe saw Gorulga at the head of the parade, a profile chiseled out of\ncopper, etched in the torch glare. The rest were acolytes, giant black\nmen from whose skins the torches struck highlights. At the end of the\nprocession there stalked a huge negro with an unusually wicked cast of\ncountenance, at the sight of whom Conan scowled. That was Gwarunga, whom\nMuriela had named as the man who had revealed the secret of the\npool-entrance to Zargheba. Conan wondered how deeply the man was in the\nintrigues of the Stygian.\n\nHe hurried toward the portico, circling the open space to keep in the\nfringing shadows. They left no one to guard the entrance. The torches\nstreamed steadily down the long dark hall. Before they reached the\ndouble-valved door at the other end, Conan had mounted the other steps\nand was in the hall behind them. Slinking swiftly along the column-lined\nwall, he reached the great door as they crossed the huge throne-room,\ntheir torches driving back the shadows. They did not look back. In\nsingle file, their ostrich plumes nodding, their leopard-skin tunics\ncontrasting curiously with the marble and arabesqued metal of the\nancient palace, they moved across the wide room and halted momentarily\nat the golden door to the left of the throne-dais.\n\nGorulga's voice boomed eerily and hollowly in the great empty space,\nframed in sonorous phrases unintelligible to the lurking listener; then\nthe high priest thrust open the golden door and entered, bowing\nrepeatedly from his waist, and behind him the torches sank and rose,\nshowering flakes of flame, as the worshippers imitated their master. The\ngold door closed behind them, shutting out sound and sight, and Conan\ndarted across the throne-chamber and into the alcove behind the throne.\nHe made less sound than a wind blowing across the chamber.\n\nTiny beams of light streamed through the apertures in the wall, as he\npried open the secret panel. Gliding into the niche, he peered through.\nMuriela sat upright on the dais, her arms folded, her head leaning back\nagainst the wall, within a few inches of his eyes. The delicate perfume\nof her foamy hair was in his nostrils. He could not see her face, of\ncourse, but her attitude was as if she gazed tranquilly into some far\ngulf of space, over and beyond the shaven heads of the black giants who\nknelt before her. Conan grinned with appreciation. 'The little slut's an\nactress,' he told himself. He knew she was shriveling with terror, but\nshe showed no sign. In the uncertain flare of the torches she looked\nexactly like the goddess he had seen lying on that same dais, if one\ncould imagine that goddess imbued with vibrant life.\n\nGorulga was booming forth some kind of a chant in an accent unfamiliar\nto Conan, and which was probably some invocation in the ancient tongue\nof Alkmeenon, handed down from generation to generation of high priests.\nIt seemed interminable. Conan grew restless. The longer the thing\nlasted, the more terrific would be the strain on Muriela. If she\nsnapped--he hitched his sword and dagger forward. He could not see the\nlittle trollop tortured and slain by these men.\n\nBut the chant--deep, low-pitched and indescribably ominous--came to a\nconclusion at last, and a shouted acclaim from the acolytes marked its\nperiod. Lifting his head and raising his arms toward the silent form on\nthe dais, Gorulga cried in the deep, rich resonance that was the natural\nattribute of the Keshani priest: 'Oh, great goddess, dweller with the\ngreat one of darkness, let thy heart be melted, thy lips opened for the\nears of thy slave whose head is in the dust beneath thy feet! Speak,\ngreat goddess of the holy valley! Thou knowest the paths before us; the\ndarkness that vexes us is as the light of the midday sun to thee. Shed\nthe radiance of thy wisdom on the paths of thy servants! Tell us, oh\nmouthpiece of the gods: what is their will concerning Thutmekri the\nStygian?'\n\nThe high-piled burnished mass of hair that caught the torchlight in dull\nbronze gleams quivered slightly. A gusty sigh rose from the blacks, half\nin awe, half in fear. Muriela's voice came plainly to Conan's ears in\nthe breathless silence, and it seemed, cold, detached, impersonal,\nthough the Cimmerian winced at the Corinthian accent.\n\n'It is the will of the gods that the Stygian and his Shemitish dogs be\ndriven from Keshan!' She was repeating his exact words. 'They are\nthieves and traitors who plot to rob the gods. Let the Teeth of Gwahlur\nbe placed in the care of the general Conan. Let him lead the armies of\nKeshan. He is beloved of the gods!'\n\nThere was a quiver in her voice as she ended, and Conan began to sweat,\nbelieving she was on the point of an hysterical collapse. But the blacks\ndid not notice, any more than they identified the Corinthian accent, of\nwhich they knew nothing. They smote their palms softly together and a\nmurmur of wonder and awe rose from them. Gorulga's eyes glittered\nfanatically in the torchlight.\n\n'Yelaya has spoken!' he cried in an exalted voice. 'It is the will of\nthe gods! Long ago, in the days of our ancestors, they were made taboo\nand hidden at the command of the gods, who wrenched them from the awful\njaws of Gwahlur the king of darkness, in the birth of the world. At the\ncommand of the gods the teeth of Gwahlur were hidden; at their command\nthey shall be brought forth again. Oh star-born goddess, give us your\nleave to go to the secret hiding-place of the Teeth to secure them for\nhim whom the gods love!'\n\n'You have my leave to go!' answered the false goddess, with an imperious\ngesture of dismissal that set Conan grinning again, and the priests\nbacked out, ostrich plumes and torches rising and falling with the\nrhythm of their genuflexions.\n\nThe gold door closed and with a moan, the goddess fell back limply on\nthe dais. 'Conan!' she whimpered faintly. 'Conan!'\n\n'Shhh!' he hissed through the apertures, and turning, glided from the\nniche and closed the panel. A glimpse past the jamb of the carven door\nshowed him the torches receding across the great throne-room, but he was\nat the same time aware of a radiance that did not emanate from the\ntorches. He was startled, but the solution presented itself instantly.\nAn early moon had risen and its light slanted through the pierced dome\nwhich by some curious workmanship intensified the light. The shining\ndome of Alkmeenon was no fable, then. Perhaps its interior was of the\ncurious whitely flaming crystal found only in the hills of the black\ncountries. The light flooded the throne-room and seeped into the\nchambers immediately adjoining.\n\nBut as Conan made toward the door that led into the throne-room, he was\nbrought around suddenly by a noise that seemed to emanate from the\npassage that led off from the alcove. He crouched at the mouth, staring\ninto it, remembering the clangor of the gong that had echoed from it to\nlure him into a snare. The light from the dome filtered only a little\nway into that narrow corridor, and showed him only empty space. Yet he\ncould have sworn that he had heard the furtive pad of a foot somewhere\ndown it.\n\nWhile he hesitated, he was electrified by a woman's strangled cry from\nbehind him. Bounding through the door behind the throne, he saw an\nunexpected spectacle in the crystal light.\n\nThe torches of the priests had vanished from the great hall outside--but\none priest was still in the palace: Gwarunga. His wicked features were\nconvulsed with fury, and he grasped the terrified Muriela by the throat,\nchoking her efforts to scream and plead, shaking her brutally.\n\n'Traitress!' Between his thick red lips his voice hissed like a cobra.\n'What game are you playing? Did not Zargheba tell you what to say? Aye,\nThutmekri told me! Are you betraying your master, or is he betraying his\nfriends through you? Slut! I'll twist off your false head--but first\nI'll--'\n\nA widening of his captive's lovely eyes as she stared over his shoulder\nwarned the huge black. He released her and wheeled, just as Conan's\nsword lashed down. The impact of the stroke knocked him headlong\nbackward to the marble floor, where he lay twitching, blood oozing from\na ragged gash in his scalp.\n\nConan started toward him to finish the job--for he knew that the\npriest's sudden movement had caused the blade to strike flat--but\nMuriela threw her arms convulsively about him.\n\n'I've done as you ordered!' she gasped hysterically. 'Take me away! Oh,\nplease take me away!'\n\n'We can't go yet,' he grunted. 'I want to follow the priests and see\nwhere they get the jewels. There may be more loot hidden there. But you\ncan go with me. Where's the gem you wore in your hair?'\n\n'It must have fallen out on the dais,' she stammered, feeling for it. 'I\nwas so frightened--when the priests left I ran out to find you, and this\nbig brute had stayed behind, and he grabbed me--'\n\n'Well, go get it while I dispose of this carcass,' he commanded. 'Go on!\nThat gem is worth a fortune itself.'\n\nShe hesitated, as if loth to return to that cryptic chamber; then, as he\ngrasped Gwarunga's girdle and dragged him into the alcove, she turned\nand entered the oracle room.\n\nConan dumped the senseless black on the floor, and lifted his sword. The\nCimmerian had lived too long in the wild places of the world to have any\nillusions about mercy. The only safe enemy was a headless enemy. But\nbefore he could strike, a startling scream checked the lifted blade. It\ncame from the oracle chamber.\n\n'Conan! Conan! She's come back!' The shriek ended in a gurgle and a\nscraping shuffle.\n\nWith an oath Conan dashed out of the alcove, across the throne dais and\ninto the oracle chamber, almost before the sound had ceased. There he\nhalted, glaring bewilderedly. To all appearances Muriela lay placidly on\nthe dais, eyes closed as in slumber.\n\n'What in thunder are you doing?' he demanded acidly. 'Is this any time\nto be playing jokes--'\n\nHis voice trailed away. His gaze ran along the ivory thigh molded in the\nclose-fitting silk skirt. That skirt should gape from girdle to hem. He\nknew, because it had been his own hand that tore it as he ruthlessly\nstripped the garment from the dancer's writhing body. But the skirt\nshowed no rent. A single stride brought him to the dais and he laid his\nhand on the ivory body--snatched it away as if it had encountered hot\niron instead of the cold immobility of death.\n\n'Crom!' he muttered, his eyes suddenly slits of bale-fire. 'It's not\nMuriela! It's Yelaya!'\n\nHe understood now that frantic scream that had burst from Muriela's lips\nwhen she entered the chamber. The goddess had returned. The body had\nbeen stripped by Zargheba to furnish the accouterments for the\npretender. Yet now it was clad in silk and jewels as Conan had first\nseen it. A peculiar prickling made itself manifest among the short hairs\nat the base of Conan's scalp.\n\n'Muriela!' he shouted suddenly. 'Muriela! Where the devil are you?'\n\nThe walls threw back his voice mockingly. There was no entrance that he\ncould see except the golden door, and none could have entered or\ndeparted through that without his knowledge. This much was\nindisputable: Yelaya had been replaced on the dais within the few\nminutes that had elapsed since Muriela had first left the chamber to be\nseized by Gwarunga; his ears were still tingling with the echoes of\nMuriela's scream, yet the Corinthian girl had vanished as if into thin\nair. There was but one explanation that offered itself to the Cimmerian,\nif he rejected the darker speculation that suggested the\nsupernatural--somewhere in the chamber there was a secret door. And even\nas the thought crossed his mind, he saw it.\n\nIn what had seemed a curtain of solid marble, a thin perpendicular crack\nshowed, and in the crack hung a wisp of silk. In an instant he was\nbending over it. That shred was from Muriela's torn skirt. The\nimplication was unmistakable. It had been caught in the closing door and\ntorn off as she was borne through the opening by whatever grim beings\nwere her captors. The bit of clothing had prevented the door from\nfitting perfectly into its frame.\n\nThrusting his dagger-point into the crack, Conan exerted leverage with a\ncorded forearm. The blade bent, but it was of unbreakable Akbitanan\nsteel. The marble door opened. Conan's sword was lifted as he peered\ninto the aperture beyond, but he saw no shape of menace. Light filtering\ninto the oracle chamber revealed a short flight of steps cut out of\nmarble. Pulling the door back to its fullest extent, he drove his dagger\ninto a crack in the floor, propping it open. Then he went down the steps\nwithout hesitation. He saw nothing, heard nothing. A dozen steps down,\nthe stair ended in a narrow corridor which ran straight away into gloom.\n\nHe halted suddenly, posed like a statue at the foot of the stair,\nstaring at the paintings which frescoed the walls, half visible in the\ndim light which filtered down from above. The art was unmistakably\nPelishtim; he had seen frescoes of identical characteristics on the\nwalls of Asgalun. But the scenes depicted had no connection with\nanything Pelishtim, except for one human figure, frequently recurrent: a\nlean, white-bearded old man whose racial characteristics were\nunmistakable. They seemed to represent various sections of the palace\nabove. Several scenes showed a chamber he recognized as the oracle\nchamber with the figure of Yelaya stretched upon the ivory dais and huge\nblack men kneeling before it. And there were other figures, too--figures\nthat moved through the deserted palace, did the bidding of the\nPelishtim, and dragged unnamable things out of the subterranean river.\nIn the few seconds Conan stood frozen, hitherto unintelligible phrases\nin the parchment manuscript blazed in his brain with chilling clarity.\nThe loose bits of the pattern clicked into place. The mystery of\nB\u00eet-Yakin was a mystery no longer, nor the riddle of B\u00eet-Yakin's\nservants.\n\nConan turned and peered into the darkness, an icy finger crawling along\nhis spine. Then he went along the corridor, cat-footed, and without\nhesitation, moving deeper and deeper into the darkness as he drew\nfarther away from the stair. The air hung heavy with the odor he had\nscented in the court of the gong.\n\nNow in utter blackness he heard a sound ahead of him--the shuffle of\nbare feet, or the swish of loose garments against stone, he could not\ntell which. But an instant later his outstretched hand encountered a\nbarrier which he identified as a massive door of carven metal. He pushed\nagainst it fruitlessly, and his sword-point sought vainly for a crack.\nIt fitted into the sill and jambs as if molded there. He exerted all his\nstrength, his feet straining against the door, the veins knotting in his\ntemples. It was useless; a charge of elephants would scarcely have\nshaken that titanic portal.\n\nAs he leaned there he caught a sound on the other side that his ears\ninstantly identified--it was the creak of rusty iron, like a lever\nscraping in its slot. Instinctively action followed recognition so\nspontaneously that sound, impulse and action were practically\nsimultaneous. And as his prodigious bound carried him backward, there\nwas the rush of a great bulk from above, and a thunderous crash filled\nthe tunnel with deafening vibrations. Bits of flying splinters struck\nhim--a huge block of stone, he knew from the sound, dropped on the spot\nhe had just quitted. An instant's slower thought or action and it would\nhave crushed him like an ant.\n\nConan fell back. Somewhere on the other side of that metal door Muriela\nwas a captive, if she still lived. But he could not pass that door, and\nif he remained in the tunnel another block might fall, and he might not\nbe so lucky. It would do the girl no good for him to be crushed into a\npurple pulp. He could not continue his search in that direction. He must\nget above ground and look for some other avenue of approach.\n\nHe turned and hurried toward the stair, sighing as he emerged into\ncomparative radiance. And as he set foot on the first step, the light\nwas blotted out, and above him the marble door rushed shut with a\nresounding reverberation.\n\nSomething like panic seized the Cimmerian then, trapped in that black\ntunnel, and he wheeled on the stair, lifting his sword and glaring\nmurderously into the darkness behind him, expecting a rush of ghoulish\nassailants. But there was no sound or movement down the tunnel. Did the\nmen beyond the door--if they were men--believe that he had been disposed\nof by the fall of the stone from the roof, which had undoubtedly been\nreleased by some sort of machinery?\n\nThen why had the door been shut above him? Abandoning speculation, Conan\ngroped his way up the steps, his skin crawling in anticipation of a\nknife in his back at every stride, yearning to drown his semi-panic in a\nbarbarous burst of blood-letting.\n\nHe thrust against the door at the top, and cursed soulfully to find that\nit did not give to his efforts. Then as he lifted his sword with his\nright hand to hew at the marble, his groping left encountered a metal\nbolt that evidently slipped into place at the closing of the door. In an\ninstant he had drawn this bolt, and then the door gave to his shove. He\nbounded into the chamber like a slit-eyed, snarling incarnation of fury,\nferociously desirous to come to grips with whatever enemy was hounding\nhim.\n\nThe dagger was gone from the floor. The chamber was empty; and so was\nthe dais. Yelaya had again vanished.\n\n'By Crom!' muttered the Cimmerian. 'Is she alive, after all?'\n\nHe strode out into the throne-room, baffled, and then, struck by a\nsudden thought, stepped behind the throne and peered into the alcove.\nThere was blood on the smooth marble where he had cast down the\nsenseless body of Gwarunga--that was all. The black man had vanished as\ncompletely as Yelaya.\n\n\n\n\n4 The Teeth of Gwahlur\n\n\nBaffled wrath confused the brain of Conan the Cimmerian. He knew no more\nhow to go about searching for Muriela than he had known how to go about\nsearching for the Teeth of Gwahlur. Only one thought occurred to him--to\nfollow the priests. Perhaps at the hiding-place of the treasure some\nclue would be revealed to him. It was a slim chance, but better than\nwandering about aimlessly.\n\nAs he hurried through the great shadowy hall that led to the portico, he\nhalf expected the lurking shades to come to life behind him with rending\nfangs and talons. But only the beat of his own rapid heart accompanied\nhim into the moonlight that dappled the shimmering marble.\n\nAt the foot of the wide steps he cast about in the bright moonlight for\nsome sign to show him the direction he must go. And he found it--petals\nscattered on the sward told where an arm or garment had brushed against\na blossom-laden branch. Grass had been pressed down under heavy feet.\nConan, who had tracked wolves in his native hills, found no\ninsurmountable difficulty in following the trail of the Keshani priests.\n\nIt led away from the palace, through masses of exotic-scented shrubbery\nwhere great pale blossoms spread their shimmering petals, through\nverdant, tangled bushes that showered blooms at the touch, until he came\nat last to a great mass of rock that jutted like a titan's castle out\nfrom the cliffs at a point closest to the palace, which, however, was\nalmost hidden from view by vine-interlaced trees. Evidently that\nbabbling priest in Keshia had been mistaken when he said the Teeth were\nhidden in the palace. This trail had led him away from the place where\nMuriela had disappeared, but a belief was growing in Conan that each\npart of the valley was connected with that palace by subterranean\npassages.\n\nCrouching in the deep velvet-black shadows of the bushes, he scrutinized\nthe great jut of rock which stood out in bold relief in the moonlight.\nIt was covered with strange, grotesque carvings, depicting men and\nanimals, and half-bestial creatures that might have been gods or devils.\nThe style of art differed so strikingly from that of the rest of the\nvalley, that Conan wondered if it did not represent a different era and\nrace, and was itself a relic of an age lost and forgotten at whatever\nimmeasurably distant date the people of Alkmeenon had found and entered\nthe haunted valley.\n\nA great door stood open in the sheer curtain of the cliff, and a\ngigantic dragon head was carved about it so that the open door was like\nthe dragon's gaping mouth. The door itself was of carven bronze and\nlooked to weigh several tons. There was no lock that he could see, but\na series of bolts showing along the edge of the massive portal, as it\nstood open, told him that there was some system of locking and\nunlocking--a system doubtless known only to the priests of Keshan.\n\nThe trail showed that Gorulga and his henchmen had gone through that\ndoor. But Conan hesitated. To wait until they emerged would probably\nmean to see the door locked in his face, and he might not be able to\nsolve the mystery of its unlocking. On the other hand, if he followed\nthem in, they might emerge and lock him in the cavern.\n\nThrowing caution to the winds, he glided silently through the great\nportal. Somewhere in the cavern were the priests, the Teeth of Gwahlur,\nand perhaps a clue to the fate of Muriela. Personal risks had never yet\ndeterred the Cimmerian from any purpose.\n\nMoonlight illumined, for a few yards, the wide tunnel in which he found\nhimself. Somewhere ahead of him he saw a faint glow and heard the echo\nof a weird chanting. The priests were not so far ahead of him as he had\nthought. The tunnel debouched into a wide room before the moonlight\nplayed out, an empty cavern of no great dimensions, but with a lofty,\nvaulted roof, glowing with a phosphorescent encrustation, which, as\nConan knew, was a common phenomenon in that part of the world. It made a\nghostly half-light, in which he was able to see a bestial image\nsquatting on a shrine and the black mouths of six or seven tunnels\nleading off from the chamber. Down the widest of these--the one directly\nbehind the squat image which looked toward the outer opening--he caught\nthe gleam of torches wavering, whereas the phosphorescent glow was\nfixed, and heard the chanting increase in volume.\n\nDown it he went recklessly, and was presently peering into a larger\ncavern than the one he had just left. There was no phosphorus here, but\nthe light of the torches fell on a larger altar and a more obscene and\nrepulsive god squatting toad-like upon it. Before this repugnant deity\nGorulga and his ten acolytes knelt and beat their heads upon the ground,\nwhile chanting monotonously. Conan realized why their progress had been\nso slow. Evidently approaching the secret crypt of the Teeth was a\ncomplicated and elaborate ritual.\n\nHe was fidgeting in nervous impatience before the chanting and bowing\nwere over, but presently they rose and passed into the tunnel which\nopened behind the idol. Their torches bobbed away into the nighted\nvault, and he followed swiftly. Not much danger of being discovered. He\nglided along the shadows like a creature of the night, and the black\npriests were completely engrossed in their ceremonial mummery.\nApparently they had not even noticed the absence of Gwarunga.\n\nEmerging into a cavern of huge proportions, about whose upward curving\nwalls gallery-like ledges marched in tiers, they began their worship\nanew before an altar which was larger, and a god which was more\ndisgusting, than any encountered thus far.\n\nConan crouched in the black mouth of the tunnel, staring at the walls\nreflecting the lurid glow of the torches. He saw a carven stone stair\nwinding up from tier to tier of the galleries; the roof was lost in\ndarkness.\n\nHe started violently and the chanting broke off as the kneeling blacks\nflung up their heads. An inhuman voice boomed out high above them. They\nfroze on their knees, their faces turned upward with a ghastly blue hue\nin the sudden glare of a weird light that burst blindingly up near the\nlofty roof and then burned with a throbbing glow. That glare lighted a\ngallery and a cry went up from the high priest, echoed shudderingly by\nhis acolytes. In the flash there had been briefly disclosed to them a\nslim white figure standing upright in a sheen of silk and a glint of\njewel-crusted gold. Then the blaze smoldered to a throbbing, pulsing\nluminosity in which nothing was distinct, and that slim shape was but\na shimmering blue of ivory.\n\n'Yelaya!' screamed Gorulga, his brown features ashen. 'Why have you\nfollowed us? What is your pleasure?'\n\nThat weird unhuman voice rolled down from the roof, re-echoing under\nthat arching vault that magnified and altered it beyond recognition.\n\n'Woe to the unbelievers! Woe to the false children of Keshia! Doom to\nthem which deny their deity!'\n\nA cry of horror went up from the priests. Gorulga looked like a shocked\nvulture in the glare of the torches.\n\n'I do not understand!' he stammered. 'We are faithful. In the chamber of\nthe oracle you told us--'\n\n'Do not heed what you heard in the chamber of the oracle!' rolled that\nterrible voice, multiplied until it was as though a myriad voices\nthundered and muttered the same warning. 'Beware of false prophets and\nfalse gods! A demon in my guise spoke to you in the palace, giving false\nprophecy. Now harken and obey, for only I am the true goddess, and I\ngive you one chance to save yourselves from doom!\n\n'Take the Teeth of Gwahlur from the crypt where they were placed so long\nago. Alkmeenon is no longer holy, because it has been desecrated by\nblasphemers. Give the Teeth of Gwahlur into the hands of Thutmekri, the\nStygian, to place in the sanctuary of Dragon and Derketo. Only this can\nsave Keshan from the doom the demons of the night have plotted. Take the\nTeeth of Gwahlur and go: return instantly to Keshia; there give the\njewels to Thutmekri, and seize the foreign devil Conan and flay him\nalive in the great square.'\n\nThere was no hesitation in obeying. Chattering with fear the priests\nscrambled up and ran for the door that opened behind the bestial god.\nGorulga led the flight. They jammed briefly in the doorway, yelping as\nwildly waving torches touched squirming black bodies; they plunged\nthrough, and the patter of their speeding feet dwindled down the tunnel.\n\nConan did not follow. He was consumed with a furious desire to learn the\ntruth of this fantastic affair. Was that indeed Yelaya, as the cold\nsweat on the backs of his hands told him, or was it that little hussy\nMuriela, turned traitress after all? If it was--\n\nBefore the last torch had vanished down the black tunnel he was bounding\nvengefully up the stone stair. The blue glow was dying down, but he\ncould still make out that the ivory figure stood motionless on the\ngallery. His blood ran cold as he approached it, but he did not\nhesitate. He came on with his sword lifted, and towered like a threat of\ndeath over the inscrutable shape.\n\n'Yelaya!' he snarled. 'Dead as she's been for a thousand years! Ha!'\n\nFrom the dark mouth of a tunnel behind him a dark form lunged. But the\nsudden, deadly rush of unshod feet had reached the Cimmerian's quick\nears. He whirled like a cat and dodged the blow aimed murderously at his\nback. As the gleaming steel in the dark hand hissed past him, he struck\nback with the fury of a roused python, and the long straight blade\nimpaled his assailant and stood out a foot and a half between his\nshoulders.\n\n'So!' Conan tore his sword free as the victim sagged to the floor,\ngasping and gurgling. The man writhed briefly and stiffened. In the\ndying light Conan saw a black body and ebon countenance, hideous in the\nblue glare. He had killed Gwarunga.\n\nConan turned from the corpse to the goddess. Thongs about her knees and\nbreast held her upright against a stone pillar, and her thick hair,\nfastened to the column, held her head up. At a few yards' distance these\nbonds were not visible in the uncertain light.\n\n'He must have come to after I descended into the tunnel,' muttered\nConan. 'He must have suspected I was down there. So he pulled out the\ndagger'--Conan stooped and wrenched the identical weapon from the\nstiffening fingers, glanced at it and replaced it in his own\ngirdle--'and shut the door. Then he took Yelaya to befool his brother\nidiots. That was he shouting a while ago. You couldn't recognize his\nvoice, under this echoing roof. And that bursting blue flame--I thought\nit looked familiar. It's a trick of the Stygian priests. Thutmekri must\nhave given some of it to Gwarunga.'\n\nHe could easily have reached this cavern ahead of his companions.\nEvidently familiar with the plan of the caverns by hearsay or by maps\nhanded down in the priestcraft, he had entered the cave after the\nothers, carrying the goddess, followed a circuitous route through the\ntunnels and chambers, and ensconced himself and his burden on the\nbalcony while Gorulga and the other acolytes were engaged in their\nendless rituals.\n\nThe blue glare had faded, but now Conan was aware of another glow,\nemanating from the mouth of one of the corridors that opened on the\nledge. Somewhere down that corridor there was another field of\nphosphorus, for he recognized the faint steady radiance. The corridor\nled in the direction the priests had taken, and he decided to follow it,\nrather than descend into the darkness of the great cavern below.\nDoubtless it connected with another gallery in some other chamber, which\nmight be the destination of the priests. He hurried down it, the\nillumination growing stronger as he advanced, until he could make out\nthe floor and the walls of the tunnel. Ahead of him and below he could\nhear the priests chanting again.\n\nAbruptly a doorway in the left-hand wall was limned in the phosphorus\nglow, and to his ears came the sound of soft, hysterical sobbing. He\nwheeled, and glared through the door.\n\nHe was looking again into a chamber hewn out of solid rock, not a\nnatural cavern like the others. The domed roof shone with the\nphosphorous light, and the walls were almost covered with arabesques of\nbeaten gold.\n\nNear the farther wall on a granite throne, staring for ever toward the\narched doorway, sat the monstrous and obscene Pteor, the god of the\nPelishtim, wrought in brass, with his exaggerated attributes reflecting\nthe grossness of his cult. And in his lap sprawled a limp white figure.\n\n'Well, I'll be damned!' muttered Conan. He glanced suspiciously about\nthe chamber, seeing no other entrance or evidence of occupation, and\nthen advanced noiselessly and looked down at the girl whose slim\nshoulders shook with sobs of abject misery, her face sunk in her arms.\nFrom thick bands of gold on the idol's arms slim gold chains ran to\nsmaller bands on her wrists. He laid a hand on her naked shoulder and\nshe started convulsively, shrieked, and twisted her tear-stained face\ntoward him.\n\n'Conan!' She made a spasmodic effort to go into the usual clinch, but\nthe chains hindered her. He cut through the soft gold as close to her\nwrists as he could, grunting: 'You'll have to wear these bracelets until\nI can find a chisel or a file. Let go of me, damn it! You actresses are\ntoo damned emotional. What happened to you, anyway?'\n\n'When I went back into the oracle chamber,' she whimpered, 'I saw the\ngoddess lying on the dais as I'd first seen her. I called out to you and\nstarted to run to the door--then something grabbed me from behind. It\nclapped a hand over my mouth and carried me through a panel in the wall,\nand down some steps and along a dark hall. I didn't see what it was that\nhad hold of me until we passed through a big metal door and came into a\ntunnel whose roof was alight, like this chamber.\n\n'Oh, I nearly fainted when I saw! They are not humans! They are gray,\nhairy devils that walk like men and speak a gibberish no human could\nunderstand. They stood there and seemed to be waiting, and once I\nthought I heard somebody trying the door. Then one of the things pulled\na metal lever in the wall, and something crashed on the other side of\nthe door.\n\n'Then they carried me on and on through winding tunnels and up stone\nstairways into this chamber, where they chained me on the knees of this\nabominable idol, and then they went away. Oh, Conan, what are they?'\n\n'Servants of B\u00eet-Yakin,' he grunted. 'I found a manuscript that told me\na number of things, and then stumbled upon some frescoes that told me\nthe rest. B\u00eet-Yakin was a Pelishtim who wandered into the valley with\nhis servants after the people of Alkmeenon had deserted it. He found the\nbody of Princess Yelaya, and discovered that the priests returned from\ntime to time to make offerings to her, for even then she was worshipped\nas a goddess.\n\n'He made an oracle of her, and he was the voice of the oracle, speaking\nfrom a niche he cut in the wall behind the ivory dais. The priests never\nsuspected, never saw him or his servants for they always hid themselves\nwhen the men came. B\u00eet-Yakin lived and died here without ever being\ndiscovered by the priests. Crom knows how long he dwelt here, but it\nmust have been for centuries. The wise men of the Pelishtim know how to\nincrease the span of their lives for hundreds of years. I've seen some\nof them myself. Why he lived here alone, and why he played the part of\noracle no ordinary human can guess, but I believe the oracle part was to\nkeep the city inviolate and sacred, so he could remain undisturbed. He\nate the food the priests brought as an offering to Yelaya, and his\nservants ate other things--I've always known there was a subterranean\nriver flowing away from the lake where the people of the Puntish\nhighlands throw their dead. That river runs under this palace. They have\nladders hung over the water where they can hang and fish for the corpses\nthat come floating through. B\u00eet-Yakin recorded everything on parchment\nand painted walls.\n\n'But he died at last, and his servants mummified him according to\ninstructions he gave them before his death, and stuck him in a cave in\nthe cliffs. The rest is easy to guess. His servants, who were even more\nnearly immortal than he, kept on dwelling here, but the next time a high\npriest came to consult the oracle, not having a master to restrain them,\nthey tore him to pieces. So since then--until Gorulga--nobody came to\ntalk to the oracle.\n\n'It's obvious they've been renewing the garments and ornaments of the\ngoddess, as they'd seen B\u00eet-Yakin do. Doubtless there's a sealed chamber\nsomewhere where the silks are kept from decay. They clothed the goddess\nand brought her back to the oracle room after Zargheba had stolen her.\nAnd by the way, they took off Zargheba's head and hung it in a thicket.'\n\nShe shivered, yet at the same time breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n'He'll never whip me again.'\n\n'Not this side of hell,' agreed Conan. 'But come on. Gwarunga ruined my\nchances with his stolen goddess. I'm going to follow the priests and\ntake my chance of stealing the loot from them after they get it. And you\nstay close to me. I can't spend all my time looking for you.'\n\n'But the servants of B\u00eet-Yakin!' she whispered fearfully.\n\n'We'll have to take our chance,' he grunted. 'I don't know what's in\ntheir minds, but so far they haven't shown any disposition to come out\nand fight in the open. Come on.'\n\nTaking her wrist he led her out of the chamber and down the corridor. As\nthey advanced they heard the chanting of the priests, and mingling with\nthe sound the low sullen rushing of waters. The light grew stronger\nabove them as they emerged on a high-pitched gallery of a great cavern\nand looked down on a scene weird and fantastic.\n\nAbove them gleamed the phosphorescent roof; a hundred feet below them\nstretched the smooth floor of the cavern. On the far side this floor was\ncut by a deep, narrow stream brimming its rocky channel. Rushing out of\nimpenetrable gloom, it swirled across the cavern and was lost again in\ndarkness. The visible surface reflected the radiance above; the dark\nseething waters glinted as if flecked with living jewels, frosty blue,\nlurid red, shimmering green, an ever-changing iridescence.\n\nConan and his companion stood upon one of the gallery-like ledges that\nbanded the curve of the lofty wall, and from this ledge a natural bridge\nof stone soared in a breath-taking arch over the vast gulf of the cavern\nto join a much smaller ledge on the opposite side, across the river. Ten\nfeet below it another, broader arch spanned the cave. At either end a\ncarven stair joined the extremities of these flying arches.\n\nConan's gaze, following the curve of the arch that swept away from the\nledge on which they stood, caught a glint of light that was not the\nlurid phosphorus of the cavern. On that small ledge opposite them there\nwas an opening in the cave wall through which stars were glinting.\n\nBut his full attention was drawn to the scene beneath them. The priests\nhad reached their destination. There in a sweeping angle of the cavern\nwall stood a stone altar, but there was no idol upon it. Whether there\nwas one behind it, Conan could not ascertain, because some trick of the\nlight, or the sweep of the wall, left the space behind the altar in\ntotal darkness.\n\nThe priests had stuck their torches into holes in the stone floor,\nforming a semicircle of fire in front of the altar at a distance of\nseveral yards. Then the priests themselves formed a semicircle inside\nthe crescent of torches, and Gorulga, after lifting his arms aloft in\ninvocation, bent to the altar and laid hands on it. It lifted and tilted\nbackward on its hinder edge, like the lid of a chest, revealing a small\ncrypt.\n\nExtending a long arm into the recess, Gorulga brought up a small brass\nchest. Lowering the altar back into place, he set the chest on it, and\nthrew back the lid. To the eager watchers on the high gallery it seemed\nas if the action had released a blaze of living fire which throbbed and\nquivered about the opened chest. Conan's heart leaped and his hand\ncaught at his hilt. The Teeth of Gwahlur at last! The treasure that\nwould make its possessor the richest man in the world! His breath came\nfast between his clenched teeth.\n\nThen he was suddenly aware that a new element had entered into the light\nof the torches and of the phosphorescent roof, rendering both void.\nDarkness stole around the altar, except for that glowing spot of evil\nradiance cast by the teeth of Gwahlur, and that grew and grew. The\nblacks froze into basaltic statues, their shadows streaming grotesquely\nand gigantically out behind them.\n\nThe altar was laved in the glow now, and the astounded features of\nGorulga stood out in sharp relief. Then the mysterious space behind the\naltar swam into the widening illumination. And slowly with the crawling\nlight, figures became visible, like shapes growing out of the night and\nsilence.\n\nAt first they seemed like gray stone statues, those motionless shapes,\nhairy, man-like, yet hideously human; but their eyes were alive, cold\nsparks of gray icy fire. And as the weird glow lit their bestial\ncountenances, Gorulga screamed and fell backward, throwing up his long\narms in a gesture of frenzied horror.\n\nBut a longer arm shot across the altar and a misshapen hand locked on\nhis throat. Screaming and fighting, the high priest was dragged back\nacross the altar; a hammer-like fist smashed down, and Gorulga's cries\nwere stilled. Limp and broken he sagged across the altar, his brains\noozing from his crushed skull. And then the servants of B\u00eet-Yakin surged\nlike a bursting flood from hell on the black priests who stood like\nhorror-blasted images.\n\nThen there was slaughter, grim and appalling.\n\nConan saw black bodies tossed like chaff in the inhuman hands of the\nslayers, against whose horrible strength and agility the daggers and\nswords of the priests were ineffective. He saw men lifted bodily and\ntheir heads cracked open against the stone altar. He saw a flaming\ntorch, grasped in a monstrous hand, thrust inexorably down the gullet of\nan agonized wretch who writhed in vain against the arms that pinioned\nhim. He saw a man torn in two pieces, as one might tear a chicken, and\nthe bloody fragments hurled clear across the cavern. The massacre was as\nshort and devastating as the rush of a hurricane. In a burst of red\nabysmal ferocity it was over, except for one wretch who fled screaming\nback the way the priests had come, pursued by a swarm of blood-dabbled\nshapes of horror which reached out their red-smeared hands for him.\nFugitive and pursuers vanished down the black tunnel, and the screams of\nthe human came back dwindling and confused by the distance.\n\nMuriela was on her knees clutching Conan's legs, her face pressed\nagainst his knee and her eyes tightly shut. She was a quaking, quivering\nmold of abject terror. But Conan was galvanized. A quick glance across\nat the aperture where the stars shone, a glance down at the chest that\nstill blazed open on the blood-smeared altar, and he saw and seized the\ndesperate gamble.\n\n'I'm going after that chest!' he grated. 'Stay here!'\n\n'Oh, Mitra, no!' In an agony of fright she fell to the floor and caught\nat his sandals. 'Don't! Don't! Don't leave me!'\n\n'Lie still and keep your mouth shut!' he snapped, disengaging himself\nfrom her frantic clasp.\n\nHe disregarded the tortuous stair. He dropped from ledge to ledge with\nreckless haste. There was no sign of the monsters as his feet hit the\nfloor. A few of the torches still flared in their sockets, the\nphosphorescent glow throbbed and quivered, and the river flowed with an\nalmost articulate muttering, scintillant with undreamed radiances. The\nglow that had heralded the appearance of the servants had vanished with\nthem. Only the light of the jewels in the brass chest shimmered and\nquivered.\n\nHe snatched the chest, noting its contents in one lustful\nglance--strange, curiously shapen stones that burned with an icy,\nnon-terrestrial fire. He slammed the lid, thrust the chest under his\narm, and ran back up the steps. He had no desire to encounter the\nhellish servants of B\u00eet-Yakin. His glimpse of them in action had\ndispelled any illusion concerning their fighting ability. Why they had\nwaited so long before striking at the invaders he was unable to say.\nWhat human could guess the motives or thoughts of these monstrosities?\nThat they were possessed of craft and intelligence equal to humanity had\nbeen demonstrated. And there on the cavern floor lay crimson proof of\ntheir bestial ferocity.\n\nThe Corinthian girl still cowered on the gallery where he had left her.\nHe caught her wrist and yanked her to her feet, grunting: 'I guess it's\ntime to go!'\n\nToo bemused with terror to be fully aware of what was going on, the girl\nsuffered herself to be led across the dizzy span. It was not until they\nwere poised over the rushing water that she looked down, voiced a\nstartled yelp and would have fallen but for Conan's massive arm about\nher. Growling an objurgation in her ear, he snatched her up under his\nfree arm and swept her, in a flutter of limply waving arms and legs,\nacross the arch and into the aperture that opened at the other end.\nWithout bothering to set her on her feet, he hurried through the short\ntunnel into which this aperture opened. An instant later they emerged\nupon a narrow ledge on the outer side of the cliffs that circled the\nvalley. Less than a hundred feet below them the jungle waved in the\nstarlight.\n\nLooking down, Conan vented a gusty sigh of relief. He believed that he\ncould negotiate the descent, even though burdened with the jewels and\nthe girl; although he doubted if even he, unburdened, could have\nascended at that spot. He set the chest, still smeared with Gorulga's\nblood and clotted with his brains, on the ledge, and was about to remove\nhis girdle in order to tie the box to his back, when he was galvanized\nby a sound behind him, a sound sinister and unmistakable.\n\n'Stay here!' he snapped at the bewildered Corinthian girl. 'Don't move!'\nAnd drawing his sword, he glided into the tunnel, glaring back into the\ncavern.\n\nHalfway across the upper span he saw a gray deformed shape. One of the\nservants of B\u00eet-Yakin was on his trail. There was no doubt that the\nbrute had seen them and was following them. Conan did not hesitate. It\nmight be easier to defend the mouth of the tunnel--but this fight must\nbe finished quickly, before the other servants could return.\n\nHe ran out on the span, straight toward the oncoming monster. It was no\nape, neither was it a man. It was some shambling horror spawned in the\nmysterious, nameless jungles of the south, where strange life teemed in\nthe reeking rot without the dominance of man, and drums thundered in\ntemples that had never known the tread of a human foot. How the ancient\nPelishtim had gained lordship over them--and with it eternal exile from\nhumanity--was a foul riddle about which Conan did not care to speculate,\neven if he had had opportunity.\n\nMan and monster; they met at the highest arch of the span, where, a\nhundred feet below, rushed the furious black water. As the monstrous\nshape with its leprous gray body and the features of a carven, unhuman\nidol loomed over him, Conan struck as a wounded tiger strikes, with\nevery ounce of thew and fury behind the blow. That stroke would have\nsheared a human body asunder; but the bones of the servant of B\u00eet-Yakin\nwere like tempered steel. Yet even tempered steel could not wholly have\nwithstood that furious stroke. Ribs and shoulder-bone parted and blood\nspouted from the great gash.\n\nThere was no time for a second stroke. Before the Cimmerian could lift\nhis blade again or spring clear, the sweep of a giant arm knocked him\nfrom the span as a fly is flicked from a wall. As he plunged downward\nthe rush of the river was like a knell in his ears, but his twisted body\nfell halfway across the lower arch. He wavered there precariously for\none blood-chilling instant, then his clutching fingers hooked over the\nfarther edge, and he scrambled to safety, his sword still in his other\nhand.\n\nAs he sprang up, he saw the monster, spurting blood hideously, rush\ntoward the cliff-end of the bridge, obviously intending to descend the\nstair that connected the arches and renew the feud. At the very ledge\nthe brute paused in mid-flight--and Conan saw it too--Muriela, with the\njewel chest under her arm, stood staring wildly in the mouth of the\ntunnel.\n\nWith a triumphant bellow the monster scooped her up under one arm,\nsnatched the jewel chest with the other hand as she dropped it, and\nturning, lumbered back across the bridge. Conan cursed with passion and\nran for the other side also. He doubted if he could climb the stair to\nthe higher arch in time to catch the brute before it could plunge into\nthe labyrinth of tunnels on the other side.\n\nBut the monster was slowing, like clockwork running down. Blood gushed\nfrom that terrible gash in his breast, and he lurched drunkenly from\nside to side. Suddenly he stumbled, reeled and toppled sidewise--pitched\nheadlong from the arch and hurtled downward. Girl and jewel chest fell\nfrom his nerveless hands and Muriela's scream rang terribly above the\nsnarl of the water below.\n\nConan was almost under the spot from which the creature had fallen. The\nmonster struck the lower arch glancingly and shot off, but the writhing\nfigure of the girl struck and clung, and the chest hit the edge of the\nspan near her. One falling object struck on one side of Conan and one on\nthe other. Either was within arm's length; for the fraction of a split\nsecond the chest teetered on the edge of the bridge, and Muriela clung\nby one arm, her face turned desperately toward Conan, her eyes dilated\nwith the fear of death and her lips parted in a haunting cry of despair.\n\nConan did not hesitate, nor did he even glance toward the chest that\nheld the wealth of an epoch. With a quickness that would have shamed the\nspring of a hungry jaguar, he swooped, grasped the girl's arm just as\nher fingers slipped from the smooth stone, and snatched her up on the\nspan with one explosive heave. The chest toppled on over and struck the\nwater ninety feet below, where the body of the servant of B\u00eet-Yakin had\nalready vanished. A splash, a jetting flash of foam marked where the\nTeeth of Gwahlur disappeared for ever from the sight of the man.\n\nConan scarcely wasted a downward glance. He darted across the span and\nran up the cliff stair like a cat, carrying the limp girl as if she had\nbeen an infant. A hideous ululation caused him to glance over his\nshoulder as he reached the higher arch, to see the other servants\nstreaming back into the cavern below, blood dripping from their bared\nfangs. They raced up the stair that wound from tier to tier, roaring\nvengefully; but he slung the girl unceremoniously over his shoulder,\ndashed through the tunnel and went down the cliffs like an ape himself,\ndropping and springing from hold to hold with breakneck recklessness.\nWhen the fierce countenances looked over the ledge of the aperture, it\nwas to see the Cimmerian and the girl disappearing into the forest that\nsurrounded the cliffs.\n\n'Well,' said Conan, setting the girl on her feet within the sheltering\nscreen of branches, 'we can take our time now. I don't think those\nbrutes will follow us outside the valley. Anyway, I've got a horse tied\nat a water-hole close by, if the lions haven't eaten him. Crom's devils!\nWhat are you crying about now?'\n\nShe covered her tear-stained face with her hands, and her slim shoulders\nshook with sobs.\n\n'I lost the jewels for you,' she wailed miserably. 'It was my fault. If\nI'd obeyed you and stayed out on the ledge, that brute would never have\nseen me. You should have caught the gems and let me drown!'\n\n'Yes, I suppose I should,' he agreed. 'But forget it. Never worry about\nwhat's past. And stop crying, will you? That's better. Come on.'\n\n'You mean you're going to keep me? Take me with you?' she asked\nhopefully.\n\n'What else do you suppose I'd do with you?' He ran an approving glance\nover her figure and grinned at the torn skirt which revealed a generous\nexpanse of tempting ivory-tinted curves. 'I can use an actress like you.\nThere's no use going back to Keshia. There's nothing in Keshan now that\nI want. We'll go to Punt. The people of Punt worship an ivory woman, and\nthey wash gold out of the rivers in wicker baskets. I'll tell them that\nKeshan is intriguing with Thutmekri to enslave them--which is true--and\nthat the gods have sent me to protect them--for about a houseful of\ngold. If I can manage to smuggle you into their temple to exchange\nplaces with their ivory goddess, we'll skin them out of their jaw teeth\nbefore we get through with them!'\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Jewels of Gwahlur, by Robert E.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
