She had no\none dependent upon her, and all the money she earned was her own. Her\ndress was of cheap material perhaps, but it was cut and fitted with\nthat daintiness of perfection which seems to be the natural gift of the\nParisienne, so that one never thought of the cheapness, but admired\nonly the effect, which was charming. She was book-keeper and general\nassistant at the Pharmacie, and had a little room of her own across the\nSeine, in the Rue de Lille. She crossed the river twice every day--once\nin the morning when the sun was shining, and again at night when the\nradiant lights along the river's bank glittered like jewels in a long\nnecklace. She had her little walk through the Gardens of the Tuileries\nevery morning after crossing the Pont Royal, but she did not return\nthrough the gardens in the evening, for a park in the morning is a\ndifferent thing to a park at night. On her return she always walked\nalong the Rue de Tuileries until she came to the bridge. Her morning\nramble through the gardens was a daily delight to her, for the Rue de\nLille is narrow, and not particularly bright, so it was pleasant to\nwalk beneath the green trees, to feel the crisp gravel under her feet,\nand to see the gleaming white statues in the sunlight, with the sparkle\non the round fountain pond, by the side of which she sometimes sat. Her\nfavorite statue was one of a woman that stood on a pedestal near the\nRue de Rivoli. The arm was thrown over her head, and there was a smile\non the marble face which was inscrutable. It fascinated the girl as she\nlooked up to it, and seemed to be the morning greeting to her busy\nday's work in the city. If no one was in sight, which was often the\ncase at eight o'clock in the morning, the girl kissed the tips of her\nfingers, and tossed the salute airily up to the statue, and the woman\nof stone always smiled back at her the strange mystical smile which\nseemed to indicate that it knew much more of this world and its ways\nthan did the little Parisienne who daily gazed up at her.\n\nLurine was happy, as a matter of course, for was not Paris always\nbeautiful? Did not the sun shine brightly? And was not the air always\nclear? What more, then, could a young girl wish? There was one thing\nwhich was perhaps lacking, but that at last was supplied; and then\nthere was not a happier girl in all Paris than Lurine. She almost cried\nit aloud to her favorite statue the next morning, for it seemed to her\nthat the smile had broadened since she had passed it the morning\nbefore, and she felt as if the woman of stone had guessed the secret of\nthe woman of flesh.\n\nLurine had noticed him for several days hovering about the Pharmacie,\nand looking in at her now and then; she saw it all, but pretended not\nto see. He was a handsome young fellow with curly hair, and hands long,\nslender, and white as if he were not accustomed to doing hard, manual\nlabor. One night he followed her as far as the bridge, but she walked\nrapidly on, and he did not overtake her. He never entered the\nPharmacie, but lingered about as if waiting for a chance to speak with\nher. Lurine had no one to confide in but the woman of stone, and it\nseemed by her smile that she understood already, and there was no need\nto tell her, that the inevitable young man had come. The next night he\nfollowed her quite across the bridge, and this time Lurine did not walk\nso quickly. Girls in her position are not supposed to have normal\nintroductions to their lovers, and are generally dependent upon a\nhaphazard acquaintance, although that Lurine did not know. The young\nman spoke to her on the bridge, raising his hat from his black head as\nhe did so.\n\n\"Good evening!\" was all he said to her.\n\nShe glanced sideways shyly at him, but did not answer, and the young\nman walked on beside her.\n\n\"You come this way every night,\" he said. \"I have been watching you.\nAre you offended?\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered, almost in a whisper.\n\n\"Then may I walk with you to your home?\" he asked.\n\n\"You may walk with me as far as the corner of the Rue de Lille,\" she\nreplied.\n\n\"Thank you!\" said the young fellow, and together they walked the short\ndistance, and there he bade her good night, after asking permission to\nmeet her at the corner of the Rue St. Honor\u00e9, and walk home with her,\nthe next night.\n\n\"You must not come to the shop,\" she said.\n\n\"I understand,\" he replied, nodding his head in assent to her wishes.\nHe told her his name was Jean Duret, and by-and-by she called him Jean,\nand he called her Lurine. He never haunted the Pharmacie now, but\nwaited for her at the corner, and one Sunday he took her for a little\nexcursion on the river, which she enjoyed exceedingly. Thus time went\non, and Lurine was very happy. The statue smiled its enigmatical smile,\nthough, when the sky was overcast, there seemed to her a subtle warning\nin the smile. Perhaps it was because they had quarrelled the night\nbefore. Jean had seemed to her harsh and unforgiving. He had asked her\nif she could not bring him some things from the Pharmacie, and gave her\na list of three chemicals, the names of which he had written on a\npaper.\n\n\"You can easily get them,\" he had said; \"they are in every Pharmacie,\nand will never be missed.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the girl in horror, \"that would be stealing.\"\n\nThe young man laughed.\n\n\"How much do they pay you there?\" he asked. And when she told him, he\nlaughed again and said,\n\n\"Why, bless you, if I got so little as that I would take something from\nthe shelves every day and sell it.\"\n\nThe girl looked at him in amazement, and he, angry at her, turned upon\nhis heel and left her. She leaned her arms upon the parapet of the\nbridge, and looked down into the dark water. The river always\nfascinated her at night, and she often paused to look at it when\ncrossing the bridge, shuddering as she did so. She cried a little as\nshe thought of his abrupt departure, and wondered if she had been too\nharsh with him. After all, it was not very much he had asked her to do,\nand they did pay her so little at the Pharmacie. And then perhaps her\nlover was poor, and needed the articles he had asked her to get.\nPerhaps he was ill, and had said nothing. There was a touch on her\nshoulder. She looked round. Jean was standing beside her, but the frown\nhad not yet disappeared from his brow.\n\n\"Give me that paper,\" he said, abruptly.\n\nShe unclosed her hand, and he picked the paper from it, and was turning\naway.\n\n\"Stop!\" she said, \"I will get you what you want, but I will myself put\nthe money in the till for what they cost.\"\n\nHe stood there, looking at her for a moment, and then said--\"Lurine, I\nthink you are a little fool. They owe you ever so much more than that.\nHowever, I must have the things,\" and he gave her back the paper with\nthe caution--\"Be sure you let no one see that, and be very certain that\nyou get the right things.\" He walked with her as far as the corner of\nthe Rue de Lille. \"You are not angry with me?\" he asked her before they\nparted.\n\n\"I would do anything for you,\" she whispered, and then he kissed her\ngood night.\n\nShe got the chemicals when the proprietor was out, and tied them up\nneatly, as was her habit, afterwards concealing them in the little\nbasket in which she carried her lunch. The proprietor was a sharp-eyed\nold lynx, who looked well after his shop and his pretty little\nassistant.\n\n\"Who has been getting so much chlorate of potash?\" he asked, taking\ndown the jar, and looking sharply at her.\n\nThe girl trembled.\n\n\"It is all right,\" she said. \"Here is the money in the till.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he said. \"I did not expect you to give it away for\nnothing. Who bought it?\"\n\n\"An old man,\" replied the girl, trembling still, but the proprietor did\nnot notice that--he was counting the money, and found it right.\n\n\"I was wondering what he wanted with so much of it. If he comes in\nagain look sharply at him, and be able to describe him to me. It seems\nsuspicious.\" Why it seemed suspicious Lurine did not know, but she\npassed an anxious time until she took the basket in her hand and went\nto meet her lover at the corner of the Rue des Pyramides. His first\nquestion was--\n\n\"Have you brought me the things?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered. \"Will you take them here, now?\"\n\n\"Not here, not here,\" he replied hurriedly, and then asked anxiously,\n\"Did anyone see you take them?\"\n\n\"No, but the proprietor knows of the large package, for he counted the\nmoney.\"\n\n\"What money?\" asked Jean.\n\n\"Why, the money for the things. You didn't think I was going to steal\nthem, did you?\"\n\nThe young man laughed, and drew her into a quiet corner of the Gardens\nof the Tuileries.\n\n\"I will not have time to go with you to the Rue de Lille to-night,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"But you will come as usual to-morrow night?\" she asked, anxiously.\n\n\"Certainly, certainly.\" he replied, as he rapidly concealed the\npackages in his pockets.\n\nThe next night the girl waited patiently for her lover at the corner\nwhere they were in the habit of meeting, but he did not come. She stood\nunder the glaring light of a lamp-post so that he would recognize her\nat once. Many people accosted her as she stood there, but she answered\nnone, looking straight before her with clear honest eyes, and they\npassed on after a moment's hesitation. At last she saw a man running\nrapidly down the street, and as he passed a brilliantly-lighted window\nshe recognized Jean. He came quickly towards her.\n\n\"Here I am,\" she cried, running forward. She caught him by the arm,\nsaying, \"Oh, Jean, what is the matter?\"\n\nHe shook her rudely, and shouted at her--\"Let me go, you fool!\" But she\nclung to him, until he raised his fist and struck her squarely in the\nface. Lurine staggered against the wall, and Jean ran on. A stalwart\nman who had spoken to Lurine a few moments before, and, not\nunderstanding her silence, stood in a doorway near watching her, sprang\nout when he saw the assault, and thrust his stick between the feet of\nthe flying man, flinging him face forward on the pavement. The next\ninstant he placed his foot upon Jean's neck holding him down as if he\nwere a snake.\n\n\"You villain!\" he cried. \"Strike a woman, would you?\"\n\nJean lay there as if stunned, and two gens d'armes came pantingly upon\nthe scene.\n\n\"This scoundrel,\" said the man, \"has just assaulted a woman. I saw\nhim.\"\n\n\"He has done more than that,\" said one of the officers, grimly, as if,\nafter all, the striking of a woman was but a trivial affair.\n\nThey secured the young man, and dragged him with them. The girl came up\nto them and said, falteringly--\n\n\"It is all a mistake, it was an accident. He didn't mean to do it.\"\n\n\"Oh, he didn't, and pray how do you know?\" asked one of the officers.\n\n\"You little devil,\" said Jean to the girl, through his clinched teeth,\n\"it's all your fault.\"\n\nThe officers hurried him off.\n\n\"I think,\" said one, \"that we should have arrested the girl; you heard\nwhat she said.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the other, \"but we have enough on our hands now, if the\ncrowd find out who he is.\"\n\nLurine thought of following them, but she was so stunned by the words\nthat her lover had said to her, rather than by the blow he had given\nher that she turned her steps sadly towards the Pont Royal and went to\nher room.\n\nThe next morning she did not go through the gardens, as usual, to her\nwork, and when she entered the Pharmacie de Siam, the proprietor cried\nout, \"Here she is, the vixen! Who would have thought it of her? You\nwretch, you stole my drugs to give to that villain!\"\n\n\"I did not,\" said Lurine, stoutly. \"I put the money in the till for\nthem.\"\n\n\"Hear her! She confesses!\" said the proprietor.\n\nThe two concealed officers stepped forward and arrested her where she\nstood as the accomplice of Jean Duret, who, the night before, had flung\na bomb in the crowded Avenue de l'Op\u00e9ra.\n\nEven the prejudiced French judges soon saw that the girl was innocent\nof all evil intent, and was but the victim of the scoundrel who passed\nby the name of Jean Duret. He was sentenced for life; she was set free.\nHe had tried to place the blame on her, like the craven he was, to\nshield another woman. This was what cut Lurine to the heart. She might\nhave tried to find an excuse for his crime, but she realized that he\nhad never cared for her, and had but used her as his tool to get\npossession of the chemicals he dared not buy.\n\nIn the drizzling rain she walked away from her prison, penniless, and\nbroken in body and in spirit. She passed the little Pharmacie de Siam,\nnot daring to enter. She walked in the rain along the Rue des\nPyramides, and across the Rue de Rivoli, and into the Tuileries\nGardens. She had forgotten about her stone woman, but, unconsciously\nher steps were directed to her. She looked up at her statue with\namazement, at first not recognizing it. It was no longer the statue of\na smiling woman. The head was thrown back, the eyes closed. The last\nmortal agony was on the face. It was a ghastly monument to Death. The\ngirl was so perplexed by the change in her statue that for the moment\nshe forgot the ruin of her own life. She saw that the smiling face was\nbut a mask, held in place by the curving of the left arm over it. Life,\nshe realized now, was made up of tragedy and comedy, and he who sees\nbut the smiling face, sees but the half of life. The girl hurried on to\nthe bridge, sobbing quietly to herself, and looked down at the grey\nriver water. The passers-by paid no attention to her. Why, she\nwondered, had she ever thought the river cold and cruel and merciless?\nIt is the only home of the homeless, the only lover that does not\nchange. She turned back to the top of the flight of steps which lead\ndown, to the water's brink. She looked toward the Tuileries Gardens,\nbut she could not see her statue for the trees which intervened. \"I,\ntoo, will be a woman of stone,\" she said, as she swiftly descended the\nsteps.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CHEMISTRY OF ANARCHY.\n\n\nIt has been said in the London papers that the dissolution of the Soho\nAnarchist League was caused by want of funds. This is very far from\nbeing the case. An Anarchist League has no need for funds and so long\nas there is money enough to buy beer the League is sure of continued\nexistence. The truth about the scattering of the Soho organization was\ntold me by a young newspaper-man who was chairman at the last meeting.\n\nThe young man was not an anarchist, though he had to pretend to be one\nin the interests of his paper, and so joined the Soho League, where he\nmade some fiery speeches that were much applauded. At last Anarchist\nnews became a drug in the market, and the editor of the paper young\nMarshall Simkins belonged to, told him that he would now have to turn\nhis attention to Parliamentary work, as he would print no more\nAnarchist news in the sheet.\n\nOne might think that young Simkins would have been glad to get rid of\nhis anarchist work, as he had no love for the cause. He was glad to get\nrid of it, but he found some difficulty in sending in his resignation.\nThe moment he spoke of resigning, the members became suspicious of him.\nHe had always been rather better dressed than the others, and, besides,\nhe drank less beer. If a man wishes to be in good standing in the\nLeague he must not be fastidious as to dress, and he must be\nconstructed to hold at least a gallon of beer at a sitting. Simkins was\nmerely a \"quart\" man, and this would have told against him all along if\nit had not been for the extra gunpowder he put in his speeches. On\nseveral occasions seasoned Anarchists had gathered about him and begged\nhim to give up his designs on the Parliament buildings.\n\nThe older heads claimed that, desirable as was the obliteration of the\nHouses of Parliament, the time was not yet ripe for it. England, they\npointed out, was the only place where Anarchists could live and talk\nunmolested, so, while they were quite anxious that Simkins should go\nand blow up Vienna, Berlin, or Paris, they were not willing for him to\nbegin on London. Simkins was usually calmed down with much difficulty,\nand finally, after hissing \"Cowards!\" two or three times under his\nbreath, he concluded with, \"Oh, very well, then, you know better than I\ndo--I am only a young recruit; but allow me at least to blow up\nWaterloo Bridge, or spring a bomb in Fleet Street just to show that we\nare up and doing.\"\n\nBut this the Anarchists would not sanction. If he wanted to blow up\nbridges, he could try his hand on those across the Seine. They had\ngiven their word that there would be no explosions in London so long as\nEngland afforded them an asylum.\n\n\"But look at Trafalgar Square,\" cried Simkins angrily; \"we are not\nallowed to meet there.\"\n\n\"Who wants to meet there?\" said the chairman. \"It is ever so much more\ncomfortable in these rooms, and there is no beer in Trafalgar Square.\"\n\"Yes, yes,\" put in several others; \"the time is not yet ripe for it.\"\nThus was Simkins calmed down, and beer allowed to flow again in\ntranquillity, while some foreign Anarchist, who was not allowed to set\nfoot in his native country, would get up and harangue the crowd in\nbroken English and tell them what great things would yet be done by\ndynamite.\n\nBut when Simkins sent in his resignation a change came over their\nfeelings towards him, and he saw at once that he was a marked man. The\nchairman, in a whisper, advised him to withdraw his resignation. So\nSimkins, who was a shrewd young fellow, understanding the temper of the\nassembly, arose and said:--\n\n\"I have no desire to resign, but you do nothing except talk, and I want\nto belong to an Anarchist Society that acts.\" He stayed away from the\nnext meeting, and tried to drop them in that way, but a committee from\nthe League called upon him at his lodgings, and his landlady thought\nthat young Simkins had got into bad ways when he had such evil-looking\nmen visiting him.\n\nSimkins was in a dilemma, and could not make up his mind what to do.\nThe Anarchists apparently were not to be shaken off. He applied to his\neditor for advice on the situation, but that good man could think of no\nway out of the trouble.\n\n\"You ought to have known better,\" he said, \"than to mix up with such\npeople.\"\n\n\"But how was I to get the news?\" asked Simkins, with some indignation.\nThe editor shrugged his shoulders. That was not his part of the\nbusiness; and if the Anarchists chose to make things uncomfortable for\nthe young man, he could not help it.\n\nSimkins' fellow-lodger, a student who was studying chemistry in London,\nnoticed that the reporter was becoming gaunt with anxiety.\n\n\"Simkins,\" said Sedlitz to him one morning, \"you are haggard and\ncareworn: what is the matter with you? Are you in love, or is it merely\ndebt that is bothering you?\"\n\n\"Neither,\" replied Simkins.\n\n\"Then cheer up,\" said Sedlitz. \"If one or the other is not interfering\nwith you, anything else is easily remedied.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" rejoined Simkins; and then he sat down and\ntold his friend just what was troubling him.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Sedlitz, \"that accounts for it. There has been an unkempt\nruffian marching up and down watching this house. They are on your\ntrack, Simkins, my boy, and when they discover that you are a reporter,\nand therefore necessarily a traitor, you will be nabbed some dark\nnight.\"\n\n\"Well, that's encouraging,\" said Simkins, with his head in his hands.\n\n\"Are these Anarchists brave men, and would they risk their lives in any\nundertaking?\" asked Sedlitz.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. They talk enough, but I don't know what they would\ndo. They are quite capable, though, of tripping me up in a dark lane.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Sedlitz, \"suppose you let me try a plan. Let me give\nthem a lecture on the Chemistry of Anarchy. It's a fascinating\nsubject.\"\n\n\"What good would that do?\"\n\n\"Oh, wait till you have heard the lecture. If I don't make the hair of\nsome of them stand on end, they are braver men than I take them to be.\nWe have a large room in Clement's Inn, where we students meet to try\nexperiments and smoke tobacco. It is half club, and half a lecture-\nroom. Now, I propose to get those Anarchists in there, lock the doors,\nand tell them something about dynamite and other explosives. You give\nout that I am an Anarchist from America. Tell them that the doors will\nbe locked to prevent police interference, and that there will be a\nbarrel of beer. You can introduce me as a man from America, where they\nknow as much about Anarchism in ten minutes as they do here in ten\nyears. Tell them that I have spent my life in the study of explosives.\nI will have to make-up a little, but you know that I am a very good\namateur actor, and I don't think there will be any trouble about that.\nAt the last you must tell them that you have an appointment and will\nleave me to amuse them for a couple of hours.\"\n\n\"But I don't see what good it is all going to do, though I am\ndesperate,\" said Simkins, \"and willing to try anything. I have thought\nsome of firing a bomb off myself at an Anarchist meeting.\"\n\nWhen the Friday night of meeting arrived the large hall in Clement's\nInn was filled to the doors. Those assembled there saw a platform at\none end of the apartment, and a door that led from it to a room at the\nback of the hall. A table was on the platform, and boxes, chemical\napparatus, and other scientific-looking paraphernalia were on it. At\nthe hour of eight young Simkins appeared before the table alone.\n\n\"Fellow Anarchists,\" he said, \"you are well aware that I am tired of\nthe great amount of talk we indulge in, and the little action which\nfollows it. I have been fortunate enough to secure the co-operation of\nan Anarchist from America, who will tell you something of the cause\nthere. We have had the doors locked, and those who keep the keys are\nnow down at the entrance of the Inn, so that if a fire should occur,\nthey can quickly come and let us out. There is no great danger of fire,\nhowever, but the interruption of the police must be guarded against\nvery carefully. The windows, as you see, are shuttered and barred, and\nno ray of light can penetrate from this room outside. Until the lecture\nis over no one can leave the room, and by the same token no one can\nenter it, which is more to the purpose.\n\n\"My friend, Professor Josiah P. Slivers, has devoted his life to the\nChemistry of Anarchy, which is the title of this lecture. He will tell\nyou of some important discoveries, which are now to be made known for\nthe first time. I regret to say that the Professor is not in a very\ngood state of health, because the line of life which he has adopted has\nits drawbacks. His left eye has been blown away by a premature\nexplosion during his experiments. His right leg is also permanently\ndisabled. His left arm, as you will notice, is in a sling, having been\ninjured by a little disaster in his workshop since he came to London.\nHe is a man, as you will see, devoted body and soul to the cause, so I\nhope you will listen to him attentively. I regret that I am unable to\nremain with you to-night, having other duties to perform which are\nimperative. I will therefore, if you will permit me, leave by the back\nentrance after I have introduced the Professor to you.\"\n\nAt this moment the stumping of a wooden leg was heard, and those in the\naudience saw appear a man on crutches, with one arm in a sling and a\nbandage over an eye, although he beamed upon them benevolently with the\nother.\n\n\"Fellow Anarchists,\" said Simkins, \"allow me to introduce to you\nProfessor Josiah P. Slivers, of the United States.\"\n\nThe Professor bowed and the audience applauded. As soon as the applause\nbegan the Professor held up his unmaimed arm and said, \"Gentlemen, I\nbeg that you will not applaud.\"\n\nIt seems the fashion in America to address a11 sorts and conditions of\nmen as \"Gentlemen.\"\n\nThe Professor continued, \"I have here some explosives so sensitive that\nthe slightest vibration will cause them to go off, and I therefore ask\nyou to listen in silence to what I have to say. I must particularly ask\nyou also not to stamp on the floor.\"\n\nBefore these remarks were concluded Simkins had slipped out by the back\nentrance, and somehow his desertion seemed to have a depressing effect\nupon the company, who looked upon the broken-up Professor with eyes of\nwonder and apprehension.\n\nThe Professor drew towards him one of the boxes and opened the lid. He\ndipped his one useful hand into the box and, holding it aloft, allowed\nsomething which looked like wet sawdust to drip through his fingers.\n\"That, gentlemen,\" he said, with an air of the utmost contempt, \"is\nwhat is known to the world as dynamite. I have nothing at all to say\nagainst dynamite. It has, in its day, been a very powerful medium\nthrough which our opinions have been imparted to a listening world, but\nits day is past. It is what the lumbering stage-coach is to the\nlocomotive, what the letter is to the telegram, what the sailing-vessel\nis to the steamship. It will be my pleasant duty to-night to exhibit to\nyou an explosive so powerful and deadly that hereafter, having seen\nwhat it can accomplish, you will have nothing but derision for such\nsimple and harmless compounds as dynamite and nitro-glycerine.\"\n\nThe Professor looked with kindly sympathy over his audience as he\nallowed the yellow mixture to percolate slowly through his fingers back\ninto the box again. Ever and anon he took up a fresh handful and\nrepeated the action.\n\nThe Anarchists in the audience exchanged uneasy glances one with the\nother.\n\n\"Yet,\" continued the Professor, \"it will be useful for us to consider\nthis substance for a few moments, if but for the purpose of comparison.\nHere,\" he said, diving his hand into another box and bringing up before\ntheir gaze a yellow brick, \"is dynamite in a compressed form. There is\nenough here to wreck all this part of London, were it exploded. This\nsimple brick would lay St. Paul's Cathedral in ruins, so, however\nantiquated dynamite may become, we must always look upon it with\nrespect, just as we look upon reformers of centuries ago who perished\nfor their opinions, even though their opinions were far behind what\nours are now. I shall take the liberty of performing some experiments\nwith this block of dynamite.\" Saying which the Professor, with his free\narm, flung the block of dynamite far down the aisle, where it fell on\nthe floor with a sickening thud. The audience sprang from their seats\nand tumbled back one over the other. A wild shriek went up into the\nair, but the Professor gazed placidly on the troubled mob below him\nwith a superior smile on his face. \"I beg you to seat yourselves,\" he\nsaid, \"and for reasons which I have already explained, I trust that you\nwill not applaud any of my remarks. You have just now portrayed one of\nthe popular superstitions about dynamite, and you show by your actions\nhow necessary a lecture of this sort is in order that you may\ncomprehend thoroughly the substance with which you have to deal. That\nbrick is perfectly harmless, because it is frozen. Dynamite in its\nfrozen state will not explode--a fact well understood by miners and all\nthose who have to work with it, and who, as a rule, generally prefer to\nblow themselves to pieces trying to thaw the substance before a fire.\nWill you kindly bring that brick back to me, before it thaws out in the\nheated atmosphere of this room?\"\n\nOne of the men stepped gingerly forward and picked up the brick,\nholding it far from his body, as he tip-toed up to the platform, where\nhe laid it down carefully on the desk before the Professor.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the Professor, blandly.\n\nThe man drew a long breath of relief as he went back to his seat.\n\n\"That is frozen dynamite,\" continued the Professor, \"and is, as I have\nsaid, practically harmless. Now, it will be my pleasure to perform two\nstartling experiments with the unfrozen substance,\" and with that he\npicked up a handful of the wet sawdust and flung it on a small iron\nanvil that stood on the table. \"You will enjoy these experiments,\" he\nsaid, \"because it will show you with what ease dynamite may be handled.\nIt is a popular error that concussion will cause dynamite to explode.\nThere is enough dynamite here to blow up this hall and to send into\noblivion every person in it, yet you will see whether or not concussion\nwill explode it.\" The Professor seized a hammer and struck the\nsubstance on the anvil two or three sharp blows, while those in front\nof him scrambled wildly back over their comrades, with hair standing on\nend. The Professor ceased his pounding and gazed reproachfully at them;\nthen something on the anvil appeared to catch his eye. He bent over it\nand looked critically on the surface of the iron. Drawing himself up to\nhis full height again, he said,\n\n\"I was about to reproach you for what might have appeared to any other\nman as evidence of fear, but I see my mistake. I came very near making\na disastrous error. I have myself suffered from time to time from\nsimilar errors. I notice upon the anvil a small spot of grease; if my\nhammer had happened to strike that spot you would all now be writhing\nin your death-agonies under the ruins of this building. Nevertheless,\nthe lesson is not without its value. That spot of grease is free nitro-\nglycerine that has oozed out from the dynamite. Therein rests, perhaps,\nthe only danger in handling dynamite. As I have shown you, you can\nsmash up dynamite on an anvil without danger, but if a hammer happened\nto strike a spot of free nitroglycerine it would explode in a moment. I\nbeg to apologize to you for my momentary neglect.\"\n\nA man rose up in the middle of the hall, and it was some little time\nbefore he could command voice enough to speak, for he was shaking as if\nfrom palsy. At last he said, after he had moistened his lips several\ntimes:--\n\n\"Professor, we are quite willing to take your word about the explosive.\nI think I speak for all my comrades here. We have no doubt at all about\nyour learning, and would much prefer to hear from your own lips what\nyou have to say on the subject, and not have you waste any more\nvaluable time with experiments. I have not consulted with my comrades\nbefore speaking, but I think I voice the sense of the meeting.\" Cries\nof \"You do, you do,\" came from all parts of the hall. The Professor\nonce more beamed upon them benevolently.\n\n\"Your confidence in me is indeed touching,\" he said, \"but a chemical\nlecture without experiments is like a body without a soul. Experiment\nis the soul of research. In chemistry we must take nothing for granted.\nI have shown you how many popular errors have arisen regarding the\nsubstance with which we are dealing. It would have been impossible for\nthese errors to have arisen if every man had experimented for himself;\nand although I thank you for the mark of confidence you have bestowed\nupon me, I cannot bring myself to deprive you of the pleasure which my\nexperiments will afford you. There is another very common error to the\neffect that fire will explode dynamite. Such, gentlemen, is not the\ncase.\"\n\nThe Professor struck a match on his trousers-leg and lighted the\nsubstance on the anvil. It burnt with a pale bluish flame, and the\nProfessor gazed around triumphantly at his fellow Anarchists.\n\nWhile the shuddering audience watched with intense fascination the pale\nblue flame the Professor suddenly stooped over and blew it out.\nStraightening himself once more he said, \"Again I must apologize to\nyou, for again I have forgotten the small spot of grease. If the flame\nhad reached the spot of nitro-glycerine it would have exploded, as you\nall know. When a man has his thoughts concentrated on one subject he is\napt to forget something else. I shall make no more experiments with\ndynamite. Here, John,\" he said to the trembling attendant, \"take this\nbox away, and move it carefully, for I see that the nitro-glycerine is\noozing out. Put it as tenderly down in the next room as if it were a\nbox of eggs.\"\n\nAs the box disappeared there was a simultaneous long-drawn sigh of\nrelief from the audience.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" said the Professor, \"we come to the subject that\nought to occupy the minds of all thoughtful men.\" He smoothed his hair\ncomplacently with the palm of his practicable hand, and smiled genially\naround him.\n\n\"The substance that I am about to tell you of is my own invention, and\ncompares with dynamite as prussic acid does with new milk as a\nbeverage.\" The Professor dipped his fingers in his vest pocket and drew\nout what looked like a box of pills. Taking one pill out he placed it\nupon the anvil and as he tip-toed back he smiled on it with a smile of\ninfinite tenderness. \"Before I begin on this subject I want to warn you\nonce more that if any man as much as stamps upon the floor, or moves\nabout except on tip-toe this substance will explode and will lay London\nfrom here to Charing Cross in one mass of indistinguishable ruins. I\nhave spent ten years of my life in completing this invention. And these\npills, worth a million a box, will cure all ills to which the flesh is\nheir.\"\n\n\"John,\" he said, turning to his attendant, \"bring me a basin of water!\"\nThe basin of water was placed gingerly upon the table, and the\nProfessor emptied all the pills into it, picking up also the one that\nwas on the anvil and putting it with the others.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, with a deep sigh, \"we can breathe easier. A man can put\none of these pills in a little vial of water, place the vial in his\nvest-pocket, go to Trafalgar Square, take the pill from the vial, throw\nit in the middle of the Square, and it will shatter everything within\nthe four-mile radius, he himself having the glorious privilege of\nsuffering instant martyrdom for the cause. People have told me that\nthis is a drawback to my invention, but I am inclined to differ with\nthem. The one who uses this must make up his mind to share the fate of\nthose around him. I claim that this is the crowning glory of my\ninvention. It puts to instant test our interest in the great cause.\nJohn, bring in very carefully that machine with the electric-wire\nattachment from the next room.\"\n\nThe machine was placed upon the table. \"This,\" said the Professor,\nholding up some invisible object between his thumb and forefinger, \"is\nthe finest cambric needle. I will take upon the point of it an\ninvisible portion of the substance I speak of.\" Here he carefully\npicked out a pill from the basin, and as carefully placed it upon the\ntable, where he detached an infinitesimal atom of it and held it up on\nthe point of the needle. \"This particle,\" he said, \"is so small that it\ncannot be seen except with the aid of a microscope. I will now place\nneedle and all on the machine and touch it off with electric current;\"\nand as his hand hovered over the push-button there were cries of\n\"Stop! stop!\" but the finger descended, and instantly there was a\nterrific explosion. The very foundation seemed shaken, and a dense\ncloud of smoke rolled over the heads of the audience. As the Professor\nbecame visible through the thinning smoke, he looked around for his\naudience. Every man was under the benches, and groans came from all\nparts of the hall. \"I hope,\" said the Professor, in anxious tones,\n\"that no one has been hurt. I am afraid that I took up too much of the\nsubstance on the point of the needle, but it will enable you to imagine\nthe effect of a larger quantity. Pray seat yourselves again. This is my\nlast experiment.\"\n\nAs the audience again seated itself, another mutual sigh ascended to\nthe roof. The Professor drew the chairman's chair towards him and sat\ndown, wiping his grimy brow.\n\nA man instantly arose and said, \"I move a vote of thanks to Professor\nSlivers for the interesting----\"\n\nThe Professor raised his hand. \"One moment,\" he said, \"I have not quite\nfinished. I have a proposal to make to you. You see that cloud of smoke\nhovering over our heads? In twenty minutes that smoke will percolate\ndown through the atmosphere. I have told you but half of the benefits\nof this terrific explosive. When that smoke mixes with the atmosphere\nof the room it becomes a deadly poison. We all can live here for the\nnext nineteen minutes in perfect safety, then at the first breath we\ndraw we expire instantly. It is a lovely death. There is no pain, no\ncontortion of the countenance, but we will be found here in the morning\nstark and stiff in our seats. I propose, gentlemen, that we teach\nLondon the great lesson it so much needs. No cause is without its\nmartyrs. Let us be the martyrs of the great religion of Anarchy. I have\nleft in my room papers telling just how and why we died. At midnight\nthese sheets will be distributed to all the newspapers of London, and\nto-morrow the world will ring with our heroic names. I will now put the\nmotion. All in favor of this signify it by the usual upraising of the\nright hand.\"\n\nThe Professor's own right hand was the only one that was raised.\n\n\"Now all of a contrary opinion,\" said the Professor, and at once every\nhand in the audience went up.\n\n\"The noes have it,\" said the Professor, but he did not seem to feel\nbadly about it. \"Gentlemen,\" he continued, \"I see that you have guessed\nmy second proposal, as I imagined you would, and though there will be\nno newspapers in London to-morrow to chronicle the fact, yet the\nnewspapers of the rest of the world will tell of the destruction of\nthis wicked city. I see by your looks that you are with me in this, my\nsecond proposal, which is the most striking thing ever planned, and is\nthat we explode the whole of these pills in the basin. To make sure of\nthis, I have sent to an agent in Manchester the full account of how it\nwas done, and the resolutions brought forward at this meeting, and\nwhich doubtless you will accept.\n\n\"Gentlemen, all in favor of the instant destruction of London signify\nit in the usual manner.\"\n\n\"Mr. Professor,\" said the man who had spoken previously, \"before you\nput that resolution I would like to move an amendment. This is a very\nserious proposal, and should not be lightly undertaken. I move as an\namendment, therefore, that we adjourn this meeting to our rooms at\nSoho, and do the exploding there. I have some little business that must\nbe settled before this grand project is put in motion.\"\n\nThe Professor then said, \"Gentlemen, the amendment takes precedence. It\nis moved that this meeting be adjourned, so that you may consider the\nproject at your club-rooms in Soho.\"\n\n\"I second that amendment,\" said fifteen of the audience rising together\nto their feet.\n\n\"In the absence of the regular chairman,\" said the Professor, \"it is my\nduty to put the amendment. All in favor of the amendment signify it by\nraising the right hand.\"\n\nEvery hand was raised. \"The amendment, gentlemen, is carried. I shall\nbe only too pleased to meet you to-morrow night at your club, and I\nwill bring with me a larger quantity of my explosive. John, kindly go\nround and tell the man to unlock the doors.\"\n\nWhen Simkins and Slivers called round the next night at the regular\nmeeting-place of the Anarchists, they found no signs of a gathering,\nand never since the lecture has the Soho Anarchist League been known to\nhold a meeting. The Club has mysteriously dissolved.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FEAR OF IT.\n\n\nThe sea was done with him. He had struggled manfully for his life, but\nexhaustion came at last, and, realizing the futility of further\nfighting, he gave up the battle. The tallest wave, the king of that\nroaring tumultuous procession racing from the wreck to the shore, took\nhim in its relentless grasp, held him towering for a moment against the\nsky, whirled his heels in the air, dashed him senseless on the sand,\nand, finally, rolled him over and over, a helpless bundle, high up upon\nthe sandy beach.\n\nHuman life seems of little account when we think of the trifles that\nmake toward the extinction or the extension of it. If the wave that\nbore Stanford had been a little less tall, he would have been drawn\nback into the sea by one that followed. If, as a helpless bundle, he\nhad been turned over one time more or one less, his mouth would have\npressed into the sand, and he would have died. As it was, he lay on his\nback with arms outstretched on either side, and a handful of dissolving\nsand in one clinched fist. Succeeding waves sometimes touched him, but\nhe lay there unmolested by the sea with his white face turned to the\nsky.\n\nOblivion has no calendar. A moment or an eternity are the same to it.\nWhen consciousness slowly returned, he neither knew nor cared how time\nhad fled. He was not quite sure that he was alive, but weakness rather\nthan fear kept him from opening his eyes to find out whether the world\nthey would look upon was the world they had last gazed at. His\ninterest, however, was speedily stimulated by the sound of the English\ntongue. He was still too much dazed to wonder at it, and to remember\nthat he was cast away on some unknown island in the Southern Seas. But\nthe purport of the words startled him.\n\n\"Let us be thankful. He is undoubtedly dead.\" This was said in a tone\nof infinite satisfaction.\n\nThere seemed to be a murmur of pleasure at the announcement from those\nwho were with the speaker. Stanford slowly opened his eyes, wondering\nwhat these savages were who rejoiced in the death of an inoffensive\nstranger cast upon their shores. He saw a group standing around him,\nbut his attention speedily became concentrated on one face. The owner\nof it, he judged, was not more than nineteen years of age, and the\nface--at least so it seemed to Stanford at the time--was the most\nbeautiful he had ever beheld. There was an expression of sweet gladness\nupon it until her eyes met his, then the joy faded from the face, and a\nlook of dismay took its place. The girl seemed to catch her breath in\nfear, and tears filled her eyes.\n\n\"Oh,\" she cried, \"he is going to live.\"\n\nShe covered her face with her hands, and sobbed.\n\nStanford closed his eyes wearily. \"I am evidently insane,\" he said to\nhimself. Then, losing faith in the reality of things, he lost\nconsciousness as well, and when his senses came to him again he found\nhimself lying on a bed in a clean but scantily furnished room. Through\nan open window came the roar of the sea, and the thunderous boom of the\nfalling waves brought to his mind the experiences through which he had\npassed. The wreck and the struggle with the waves he knew to be real,\nbut the episode on the beach he now believed to have been but a vision\nresulting from his condition.\n\nA door opened noiselessly, and, before he knew of anyone's entrance, a\nplacid-faced nurse stood by his bed and asked him how he was.\n\n\"I don't know. I am at least alive.\"\n\nThe nurse sighed, and cast down her eyes. Her lips moved, but she said\nnothing. Stanford looked at her curiously. A fear crept over him that\nhe was hopelessly crippled for life, and that death was considered\npreferable to a maimed existence. He felt wearied, though not in pain,\nbut he knew that sometimes the more desperate the hurt, the less the\nvictim feels it at first.\n\n\"Are--are any of my--my bones broken, do you know?\" he asked.\n\n\"No. You are bruised, but not badly hurt. You will soon recover.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Stanford, with a sigh of relief. \"By the way,\" he added,\nwith sudden interest, \"who was that girl who stood near me as I lay on\nthe beach?\"\n\n\"There were several.\"\n\n\"No, there was but one. I mean the girl with the beautiful eyes and a\nhalo of hair like a glorified golden crown on her head.\"\n\n\"We speak not of our women in words like those,\" said the nurse,\nseverely; \"you mean Ruth, perhaps, whose hair is plentiful and yellow.\"\n\nStanford smiled. \"Words matter little,\" he said.\n\n\"We must be temperate in speech,\" replied the nurse.\n\n\"We may be temperate without, being teetotal. Plentiful and yellow,\nindeed! I have had a bad dream concerning those who found me. I thought\nthat they--but it does not matter. She at least is not a myth. Do you\nhappen to know if any others were saved?\"\n\n\"I am thankful to be able to say that every one was drowned.\"\n\nStanford started up with horror in his eyes. The demure nurse, with\nsympathetic tones, bade him not excite himself. He sank back on his\npillow.\n\n\"Leave the room,\" he cried, feebly, \"Leave me--leave me.\" He turned his\nface toward the wall, while the woman left as silently as she had\nentered.\n\nWhen she was gone Stanford slid from the bed, intending to make his way\nto the door and fasten it. He feared that these savages, who wished him\ndead, would take measures to kill him when they saw he was going to\nrecover. As he leaned against the bed, he noticed that the door had no\nfastening. There was a rude latch, but neither lock nor bolt. The\nfurniture of the room was of the most meagre description, clumsily\nmade. He staggered to the open window, and looked out. The remnants of\nthe disastrous gale blew in upon him and gave him new life, as it had\nformerly threatened him with death. He saw that he was in a village of\nsmall houses, each cottage standing in its own plot of ground. It was\napparently a village of one street, and over the roofs of the houses\nopposite he saw in the distance the white waves of the sea. What\nastonished him most was a church with its tapering spire at the end of\nthe street--a wooden church such as he had seen in remote American\nsettlements. The street was deserted, and there were no signs of life\nin the houses.\n\n\"I must have fallen in upon some colony of lunatics,\" he said to\nhimself. \"I wonder to what country these people belong--either to\nEngland or the United States, I imagine--yet in all my travels I never\nheard of such a community.\"\n\nThere was no mirror in the room, and it was impossible for him to know\nhow he looked. His clothes were dry and powdered with salt. He arranged\nthem as well as he could, and slipped out of the house unnoticed. When\nhe reached the outskirts of the village he saw that the inhabitants,\nboth men and women, were working in the fields some distance away.\nComing towards the village was a girl with a water-can in either hand.\nShe was singing as blithely as a lark until she saw Stanford, whereupon\nshe paused both in her walk and in her song. Stanford, never a backward\nman, advanced, and was about to greet her when she forestalled him by\nsaying:\n\n\"I am grieved, indeed, to see that you have recovered.\"\n\nThe young man's speech was frozen on his lip, and a frown settled off\nhis brow. Seeing that he was annoyed, though why she could not guess,\nRuth hastened to amend matters by adding:\n\n\"Believe me, what I say is true. I am indeed sorry.\"\n\n\"Sorry that I live?\"\n\n\"Most heartily am I.\"\n\n\"It is hard to credit such a statement from one so--from you.\"\n\n\"Do not say so. Miriam has already charged me with being glad that you\nwere not drowned. It would pain me deeply if you also believed as she\ndoes.\"\n\nThe girl looked at him with swimming eyes, and the young man knew not\nwhat to answer. Finally he said:\n\n\"There is some horrible mistake. I cannot make it out. Perhaps our\nwords, though apparently the same, have a different meaning. Sit down,\nRuth, I want to ask you some questions.\"\n\nRuth cast a timorous glance towards the workers, and murmured something\nabout not having much time to spare, but she placed the water-cans on\nthe ground and sank down on the grass. Stanford throwing himself on the\nsward at her feet, but, seeing that she shrank back, he drew himself\nfurther from her, resting where he might gaze upon her face.\n\nRuth's eyes were downcast, which was necessary, for she occupied\nherself in pulling blade after blade of grass, sometimes weaving them\ntogether. Stanford had said he wished to question her, but he\napparently forgot his intention, for he seemed wholly satisfied with\nmerely looking at her. After the silence had lasted for some time, she\nlifted her eyes for one brief moment, and then asked the first question\nherself.\n\n\"From what land do you come?\"\n\n\"From England.\"\n\n\"Ah! that also is an island, is it not?\"\n\nHe laughed at the \"also,\" and remembered that he had some questions to\nask.\n\n\"Yes, it is an island--also. The sea dashes wrecks on all four sides of\nit, but there is no village on its shores so heathenish that if a man\nis cast upon the beach the inhabitants do not rejoice because he has\nescaped death.\"\n\nRuth looked at him with amazement in her eyes.\n\n\"Is there, then, no religion in England?\"\n\n\"Religion? England is the most religious country on the face of the\nearth. There are more cathedrals, more churches, more places of worship\nin England than in any other State that I know of. We send missionaries\nto all heathenish lands. The Government, itself, supports the Church.\"\n\n\"I imagine, then, I mistook your meaning. I thought from what you said\nthat the people of England feared death, and did not welcome it or\nrejoice when one of their number died.\"\n\n\"They do not fear death, and they do not rejoice when it comes. Far from\nit. From the peer to the beggar, everyone fights death as long as he\ncan; the oldest cling to life as eagerly as the youngest. Not a man but\nwill spend his last gold piece to ward off the inevitable even for an\nhour.\"\n\n\"Gold piece--what is that?\"\n\nStanford plunged his hand into his pocket.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, \"there are some coins left. Here is a gold piece.\"\n\nThe girl took it, and looked at it with keen interest.\n\n\"Isn't it pretty?\" she said, holding the yellow coin on her pink palm,\nand glancing up at him.\n\n\"That is the general opinion. To accumulate coins like that, men will\nlie, and cheat, and steal--yes, and work. Although they will give their\nlast sovereign to prolong their lives, yet will they risk life itself\nto accumulate gold. Every business in England is formed merely for the\ngathering together of bits of metal like that in your hand; huge\ncompanies of men are formed so that it may be piled up in greater\nquantities. The man who has most gold has most power, and is generally\nthe most respected; the company which makes most money is the one\npeople are most anxious to belong to.\"\n\nRuth listened to him with wonder and dismay in her eyes. As he talked\nshe shuddered, and allowed the yellow coin to slip from her hand to the\nground. \"No wonder such a people fears death.\"\n\n\"Do you not fear death?\"\n\n\"How can we, when we believe in heaven?\"\n\n\"But would you not be sorry if someone died whom you loved?\"\n\n\"How could we be so selfish? Would you be sorry if your brother, or\nsomeone you loved, became possessed of whatever you value in England--a\nlarge quantity of this gold, for instance?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. But then you see--well, it isn't exactly the same\nthing. If one you care for dies you are separated from him, and----\"\n\n\"But only for a short time, and that gives but another reason for\nwelcoming death. It seems impossible that Christian people should fear\nto enter Heaven. Now I begin to understand why our forefathers left\nEngland, and why our teachers will never tell us anything about the\npeople there. I wonder why missionaries are not sent to England to\nteach them the truth, and try to civilize the people?\"\n\n\"That would, indeed, be coals to Newcastle. But there comes one of the\nworkers.\"\n\n\"It is my father,\" cried the girl, rising. \"I fear I have been\nloitering. I never did such a thing before.\"\n\nThe man who approached was stern of countenance.\n\n\"Ruth,\" he said, \"the workers are athirst.\"\n\nThe girl, without reply, picked up her pails and departed.\n\n\"I have been receiving,\" said the young man, coloring slightly, \"some\ninstruction regarding your belief. I had been puzzled by several\nremarks I had heard, and wished to make inquiries concerning them.\"\n\n\"It is more fitting,\" said the man, coldly, \"that you should receive\ninstruction from me or from some of the elders than from one of the\nyoungest in the community. When you are so far recovered as to be able\nto listen to an exposition of our views, I hope to put forth such\narguments as will convince you that they are the true views. If it\nshould so happen that my arguments are not convincing, then I must\nrequest that you will hold no communication with our younger members.\nThey must not be contaminated by the heresies of the outside world.\"\n\nStanford looked at Ruth standing beside the village well.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"you underrate the argumentative powers of the younger\nmembers. There is a text bearing upon the subject which I need not\nrecall to you. I am already convinced.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE METAMORPHOSES OF JOHNSON.\n\n\nI was staying for some weeks at a lovely town in the Tyrol which I\nshall take the liberty of naming Schwindleburg. I conceal its real\ntitle because it charges what is termed a visitors' tax, and a heavy\nvisitors' tax, exacting the same from me through the medium of my hotel\nbill. The town also made me pay for the excellent band that performs\nmorning and afternoon in the Kurpark. Many continental health resorts\nsupport themselves by placing a tax upon visitors, a practice resorted\nto by no English town, and so I regard the imposition as a swindle, and\nI refuse to advertise any place that practises it. It is true that if\nyou stay in Schwindleburg less than a week they do not tax you, but I\ndidn't know that, and the hotel man, being wise in his own generation,\ndid not present his bill until a day after the week was out, so I found\nmyself in for the visitors' tax and the music money before I was aware\nof it. Thus does a foolish person accumulate wisdom by foreign travel.\nI stayed on at this picturesque place, listening to the band every day,\ntrying to get value for my money. I intended to keep much to myself,\nhaving work to do, and make no acquaintances, but I fell under the\nfascination of Johnson, thus breaking my rule. What is the use of\nmaking a rule if you can't have the pleasure of breaking it?\n\nI think the thing that first attracted me to Johnson was his utter\nnegligence in the matter of his personal appearance. When he stepped down\nfrom the hotel 'bus he looked like a semi-respectable tramp. He wore a\nblue woolen shirt, with no collar or necktie. He had a slouch hat, without\nthe usual affectation of a Tyrolese feather in it. His full beard had\nevidently not been trimmed for weeks, and he had one trouser-leg turned\nup. He had no alpenstock, and that also was a merit. So I said to\nmyself, \"Here is a man free from the conventionalities of society. If I\nbecome acquainted with anybody it will be with him.\"\n\nI found Johnson was an American from a Western city named Chicago,\nwhich I had heard of, and we \"palled on.\" He was very fond of music,\nand the band in the Kurpark was a good one, so we went there together\ntwice a day, and talked as we walked up and down the gravel paths. He\nhad been everywhere, and knew his way about; his conversation was\ninteresting. In about a week I had come to love Johnson, and I think he\nrather liked me.\n\nOne day, as we returned together to the Hotel Post, he held out his\nhand.\n\n\"I'm off to-morrow,\" he said; \"off to Innsbruck. So I shall bid you\ngood-bye. I am very glad indeed to have met you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.\" I replied. \"But I won't say good-bye now,\nI'll see you to the station to-morrow.\"\n\n\"No, don't do that. I shall be away before you are up. We'll say good-\nbye here.\"\n\nWe did, and when I had breakfast next morning I found Johnson had left\nby the early train. I wandered around the park that forenoon mourning\nfor Johnson. The place seemed lonely without him. In the afternoon I\nexplored some of the by-paths of the park within hearing distance of\nthe band, when suddenly, to my intense surprise, I met my departed\nfriend.\n\n\"Hello! Johnson,\" I cried, \"I thought you left this morning.\"\n\nThe man looked at me with no recognition in his face.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said, \"my name is Baumgarten.\"\n\nLooking more closely at him I at once saw I was mistaken. I had been\nthinking of Johnson at the time, which probably accounted for the\nerror. Still, his likeness to Johnson was remarkable--to Johnson well\ngroomed. He had neatly-trimmed side-whiskers and moustache, while\nJohnson had a full beard. His round hat was new, and he wore an\nirreproachable collar, and even cuffs. Besides this he sported a cane,\nand evidently possessed many weaknesses to which Johnson was superior.\nI apologized for my mistake, and was about to walk on when Baumgarten\nshowed signs of wishing to become acquainted.\n\n\"I have just arrived,\" he said, \"and know nothing of the place. Have\nyou been here long?\"\n\n\"About two weeks,\" I answered.\n\n\"Ah! then, you are a resident as it were. Are there any good ascents to\nbe made around here?\"\n\n\"I have not been informed that there are. I am not a climber myself,\nexcept by funicular railway. I am always content to take other people's\nfigures for the heights. The only use I have for a mountain is to look\nat it.\"\n\nThen Baumgarten launched into a very interesting account of mountain\ndangers he had passed through. I found him a most entertaining talker,\nalmost as fascinating as Johnson himself. He told me he was from\nHanover, but he had been educated in Great Britain, which accounted for\nhis perfect English.\n\n\"What hotel are you at?\" he asked, as the band ceased playing.\n\n\"I am staying at the Post,\" I answered. \"And you?\"\n\n\"I am at the Adler. You must come to dine with me some evening, and I\nwill make it even by dining with you. We can thus compare _table\nd'h\u00f4tes_.\"\n\nBaumgarten improved on acquaintance in spite of his foppishness in\ndress. I almost forgot Johnson until one day I was reminded of him one\nday by Baumgarten saying, \"I leave to-night for Innsbruck.\"\n\n\"Innsbruck? Why, that's where Johnson is. You ought to meet him. He's\nan awfully good fellow. A little careless about his clothes, that's\nall.\"\n\n\"I should like to meet him. I know no one in Innsbruck. Do you happen\nto know the name of his hotel?\"\n\n\"I do not. I don't even know Johnson's first name. But I'll write you a\nnote of introduction on my card, and if you should come across him,\ngive him my regards.\"\n\nBaumgarten accepted the card with thanks, and we parted.\n\nNext day, being warm, I sat on a bench in the shade listening to the\nmusic. Now that Baumgarten had gone, I was meditating on his strange\nresemblance to Johnson, and remembering things. Someone sat down beside\nme, but I paid no attention to him. Finally he said: \"This seems to be\na very good band.\"\n\nI started at the sound of his voice, and looked at him too much\nastonished to reply.\n\nHe wore a moustache, but no whiskers, and a green Tyrolese felt hat\nwith a feather in it. An alpenstock leaned against the bench beside\nhim, its iron point in the gravel. He wore knickerbockers; in fact, his\nwhole appearance was that of the conventional mountaineer-tourist. But\nthe voice! And the expression of the eyes!\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I said the band is very good.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. Quite so. It's expensive, and it ought to be good. I'm\nhelping to pay for it. By the way, you arrived this morning, I take\nit?\"\n\n\"I came last night.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed. And you depart in a few days for Innsbruck?\"\n\n\"No, I go to Salzburg when I leave here.\"\n\n\"And your name isn't Johnson--or--or Baumgarten, by any chance?\"\n\n\"It is not.\"\n\n\"You come neither from Chicago nor Hanover?\"\n\n\"I have never been in America, nor do I know Hanover. Anything else?\"\n\n\"Nothing else. It's all right. It's none of my business, of course.\"\n\n\"What is none of your business?\"\n\n\"Who are you.\"\n\n\"Oh, there's no secret about that. I am a Russian. My name is Katzoff.\nAt least, these are the first and last syllables of my name. I never\nuse my full name when I travel; it is too complicated.\"\n\n\"Thanks. And how do you account for your perfect English? Educated in\nEngland, I presume? Baumgarten was.\"\n\n\"No, I was not. You know we Russians are reputed to be good linguists.\"\n\n\"Yes, I had forgotten that. We will now return to the point from which\nwe started. The band is excellent, and it is about to play one of four\nfavorite selections, Mr. Katzburg.\"\n\n\"Katzoff is the name. As to the selection, I don't know much about\nmusic, although I am fond of popular pieces.\"\n\nKatzoff and I got along very nicely, although I did not seem to like\nhim as well as either Johnson or Baumgarten. He left for Salzburg\nwithout bidding me good-bye. Missing him one day, I called at the\nAngleterre, and the porter told me he had gone.\n\nNext day I searched for him, wondering in what garb I should find him.\nI passed him twice as he sat on the bench, before I was sure enough to\naccost him. The sacrifice of his moustache had made a remarkable\ndifference. His clean-shaven face caused him to look at least ten years\nyounger. He wore a tall silk hat, and a long black morning coat. I\nfound myself hardly able to withdraw my eyes from the white spats that\npartially covered his polished boots. He was reading an English paper,\nand did not observe my scrutiny. I approached him.\n\n\"Well, Johnson,\" I said, \"this _is_ a lay out. You're English this\ntime, I suppose?\"\n\nThe man looked up in evident surprise. Fumbling around the front of his\nwaistcoat for a moment, he found a black silk string, which he pulled,\nbringing to his hand a little round disc of glass. This he stuck in one\neye, grimacing slightly to keep it in place, and so regarded me\napparently with some curiosity. My certainty that it was Johnson\nwavered for a moment, but I braved it out.\n\n\"That monocle is a triumph, Johnson. In combination with the spats it\nabsolutely staggers me. If you had tried that on as Baumgarten I don't\nknow that I should have recognized you. Johnson, what's your game?\"\n\n\"You seem to be laboring under some delusion,\" he said at last. \"My\nname is not Johnson. I am Lord Somerset Campbell, if you care to know.\"\n\n\"Really? Oh, well, that's all right. I'm the Duke of Argyll, so we must\nbe relatives. Blood is thicker than water, Campbell. Confess. Whom have\nyou murdered?\"\n\n\"I knew,\" said his lordship, slowly, \"that the largest lunatic asylum\nin the Tyrol is near here, but I was not aware that the patients were\nallowed to stroll in the Kurpark.\"\n\n\"That's all very well, Johnson, but----\"\n\n\"Campbell, if you please.\"\n\n\"I don't please, as it happens. This masquerade has gone on long\nenough. What's your crime? Or are you on the other side of the fence?\nAre you practising the detective business?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, I don't know you, and I resent your impertinent\ncuriosity. Allow me to wish you good-day.\"\n\n\"It won't do, Johnson, it has gone too far. You have played on my\nfeelings, and I won't stand it. I'll go to the authorities and relate\nthe circumstances. They are just suspicious enough to----\"\n\n\"Which? The authorities or the circumstances?\" asked Johnson, sitting\ndown again.\n\n\"Both, my dear boy, both, and you know it. Now, Johnson, make a clean\nbreast of it, I won't give you away.\"\n\nJohnson sighed, and his glass dropped from his eye. He looked around\ncautiously. \"Sit down,\" he said.\n\n\"Then you _are_ Johnson!\" I cried, with some exultation.\n\n\"I thought you weren't very sure,\" began Johnson. \"However, it doesn't\nmatter, but you should be above threatening a man. That was playing it\nlow down.\"\n\n\"I see you're from Chicago. Go on.\"\n\n\"It's all on account of this accursed visitors' tax. That I decline to\npay. I stay just under the week at a hotel, and then take a 'bus to the\nstation, and another 'bus to another hotel. Of course my mistake was\ngetting acquainted with you. I never suspected you were going to stay\nhere a month.\"\n\n\"But why didn't you let me know? Your misdemeanor is one I thoroughly\nsympathize with. I wouldn't have said anything.\"\n\nJohnson shook his head.\n\n\"I took a fellow into my confidence once before. He told it as a dead\nsecret to a friend, and the friend thought it a good joke, and related\nit, always under oath that it should go no further. The authorities had\nme arrested before the week was out, and fined me heavily besides\nexacting the tax.\"\n\n\"But doesn't the 'bus fares, the changing, and all that amount to as\nmuch as the tax?\"\n\n\"I suppose it does. It isn't the money I object to, it's the principle\nof the thing.\"\n\nThis interview was the last I ever had with Johnson. About a week later\nI read in the Visitors' List that Lord Somerset Campbell, who had been\na guest of the Victoria (the swell hotel of the place), had left\nSchwindleburg for Innsbruck.\n\n\n\n\nTHE RECLAMATION OF JOE HOLLENDS.\n\n\nThe public-houses of Burwell Road--and there were many of them for the\nlength of the street--were rather proud of Joe Hollends. He was a\nperfected specimen of the work a pub produces. He was probably the most\npersistent drunkard the Road possessed, and the periodical gathering in\nof Joe by the police was one of the stock sights of the street. Many of\nthe inhabitants could be taken to the station by one policeman; some\nrequired two; but Joe's average was four. He had been heard to boast\nthat on one occasion he had been accompanied to the station by seven\nbobbies, but that was before the force had studied Joe and got him down\nto his correct mathematical equivalent. Now they tripped him up, a\npoliceman taking one kicking leg and another the other, while the\nremaining two attended to the upper part of his body. Thus they carried\nhim, followed by an admiring crowd, and watched by other envious\ndrunkards who had to content themselves with a single officer when they\nwent on a similar spree. Sometimes Joe managed to place a kick where it\nwould do the most good against the stomach of a policeman, and when the\nofficer rolled over there was for a few moments a renewal of the fight,\nsilent on the part of the men and vociferous on the part of the\ndrunkard, who had a fine flow of abusive language. Then the procession\nwent on again. It was perfectly useless to put Joe on the police\nambulance, for it required two men to sit on him while in transit, and\nthe barrow is not made to stand such a load.\n\nOf course, when Joe staggered out of the pub and fell in the gutter,\nthe ambulance did its duty, and trundled Joe to his abiding place, but\nthe real fun occurred when Joe was gathered in during the third stage\nof his debauch. He passed through the oratorical stage, then the\nmaudlin or sentimental stage, from which he emerged into the fighting\nstage, when he was usually ejected into the street, where he forthwith\nbegan to make Rome howl, and paint the town red. At this point the\npoliceman's whistle sounded, and the force knew Joe was on the warpath,\nand that duty called them to the fray.\n\nIt was believed in the neighborhood that Joe had been a college man,\nand this gave him additional standing with his admirers. His eloquence\nwas undoubted, after several glasses varying in number according to the\nstrength of their contents, and a man who had heard the great political\nspeakers of the day admitted that none of them could hold a candle to\nJoe when he got on the subject of the wrongs of the working man and the\ntyranny of the capitalist. It was generally understood that Joe might\nhave been anything he liked, and that he was no man's enemy but his\nown. It was also hinted that he could tell the bigwigs a thing or two\nif he had been consulted in affairs of State.\n\nOne evening, when Joe was slowly progressing as usual, with his feet in\nthe air, towards the station, supported by the requisite number of\npolicemen, and declaiming to the delight of the accompanying crowd, a\nwoman stood with her back to the brick wall, horror-stricken at the\nsight. She had a pale, refined face, and was dressed in black. Her\nself-imposed mission was among these people, but she had never seen Joe\ntaken to the station before, and the sight, which was so amusing to the\nneighborhood, was shocking to her. She enquired about Joe, and heard\nthe usual story that he was no man's enemy but his own, although they\nmight in justice have added the police. Still, a policeman was hardly\nlooked upon as a human being in that neighborhood. Miss Johnson\nreported the case to the committee of the Social League, and took\ncounsel. Then it was that the reclamation of Joe Hollends was\ndetermined on.\n\nJoe received Miss Johnson with subdued dignity, and a demeanor that\ndelicately indicated a knowledge on his part of her superiority and his\nown degradation. He knew how a lady should be treated even if he was a\ndrunkard, as he told his cronies afterwards. Joe was perfectly willing\nto be reclaimed. Heretofore in his life, no one had ever extended the\nhand of fellowship to him. Human sympathy was what Joe needed, and\nprecious little he had had of it. There were more kicks than halfpence\nin this world for a poor man. The rich did not care what became of the\npoor; not they--a proposition which Miss Johnson earnestly denied.\n\nIt was one of the tenets of the committee that where possible the poor\nshould help the poor. It was resolved to get Joe a decent suit of\nclothes and endeavor to find him a place where work would enable him to\nhelp himself. Miss Johnson went around the neighborhood and collected\npence for the reclamation. Most people were willing to help Joe,\nalthough it was generally felt that the Road would be less gay when he\ntook on sober habits. In one room, however, Miss Johnson was refused\nthe penny she pleaded for.\n\n\"We cannot spare even a penny,\" said the woman, whose sickly little boy\nclung to her skirts. \"My husband is just out of work again. He has had\nonly four weeks' work this time.\"\n\nMiss Johnson looked around the room and saw why there was no money. It\nwas quite evident where the earnings of the husband had gone.\n\nThe room was much better furnished than the average apartment of the\nneighborhood. There were two sets of dishes where one would have been\nquite sufficient. On the mantelshelf and around the walls were various\nunnecessary articles which cost money.\n\nMiss Johnson noted all this but said nothing, although she resolved to\nreport it to the committee. In union is strength and in multitude of\ncounsel there is wisdom. Miss Johnson had great faith in the wisdom of\nthe committee.\n\n\"How long has your husband been out of work?\" she asked.\n\n\"Only a few days, but times are very bad and he is afraid he will not\nget another situation soon.\"\n\n\"What is his trade?\"\n\n\"He is a carpenter and a good workman--sober and steady.\"\n\n\"If you give me his name I will put it down in our books. Perhaps we\nmay be able to help him.\"\n\n\"John Morris is his name.\"\n\nMiss Johnson wrote it down on her tablets, and when she left, the wife\nfelt vaguely grateful for benefits to come.\n\nThe facts of the case were reported to the committee, and Miss Johnson\nwas deputed to expostulate with Mrs. Morris upon her extravagance. John\nMorris's name was put upon the books among the names of many other\nunemployed persons. The case of Joe Hollends then came up, and elicited\nmuch enthusiasm. A decent suit of clothing had been purchased with part\nof the money collected for him, and it was determined to keep the rest\nin trust, to be doled out to him as occasion warranted.\n\nTwo persuasive ladies undertook to find a place for him in one of the\nfactories, if such a thing were possible.\n\nJoe felt rather uncomfortable in his new suit of clothes, and seemed to\nregard the expenditure as, all in all, a waste of good money. He was\nalso disappointed to find that the funds collected were not to be\nhanded over to him in a lump. It was not the money he cared about, he\nsaid, but the evident lack of trust. If people had trusted him more, he\nmight have been a better man. Trust and human sympathy were what Joe\nHollends needed.\n\nThe two persuasive ladies appealed to Mr. Stillwell, the proprietor of\na small factory for the making of boxes. They said that if Hollends got\na chance they were sure he would reform. Stillwell replied that he had\nno place for anyone. He had enough to do to keep the men already in his\nemploy. Times were dull in the box business, and he was turning away\napplicants every day who were good workmen and who didn't need to be\nreformed. However, the ladies were very persuasive, and it is not given\nto every man to be able to refuse the appeal of a pretty woman, not to\nmention two of them. Stillwell promised to give Hollends a chance, said\nhe would consult with his foreman, and let the ladies know what could\nbe done.\n\nJoe Hollends did not receive the news of his luck with the enthusiasm\nthat might have been expected. Many a man was tramping London in search\nof employment and finding none, therefore even the ladies who were so\nsolicitous about Joe's welfare thought he should be thankful that work\ncame unsought. He said he would do his best, which is, when you come to\nthink of it, all that we have a right to expect from any man.\n\nSome days afterwards Jack Morris applied to Mr. Stillwell for a job,\nbut he had no sub-committee of persuasive ladies to plead for him. He\nwould be willing to work half-time or quarter-time for that matter. He\nhad a wife and boy dependent on him. He could show that he was a good\nworkman and he did not drink. Thus did Morris recite his qualifications\nto the unwilling ears of Stillwell the box maker. As he left the place\ndisheartened with another refusal, he was overtaken by Joe Hollends.\nJoe was a lover of his fellow-man, and disliked seeing anyone\ndownhearted. He had one infallible cure for dejection. Having just been\ndischarged, he was in high spirits, because his prediction of his own\nfailure as a reformed character, if work were a condition of the\nreclamation, had just been fulfilled.\n\n\"Cheer up, old man,\" he cried, slapping Morris on the shoulder, \"what's\nthe matter? Come and have a drink with me. I've got the money.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Morris, who knew the professional drunkard but slightly, and\ndid not care for further acquaintance with him, \"I want work, not\nbeer.\"\n\n\"Every man to his taste. Why don't you ask at the box factory? You can\nhave my job and welcome. The foreman's just discharged me. Said I\nwouldn't work myself, and kept the men off theirs. Thought I talked too\nmuch about capital and labor.\"\n\n\"Do you think I could get your job?\"\n\n\"Very likely. No harm in trying. If they don't take you on, come into\nthe Red Lion--I'll be there--and have a drop. It'll cheer you up a\nbit.\"\n\nMorris appealed in vain to the foreman. They had more men now in the\nfactory than they needed, he said. So Morris went to the Red Lion,\nwhere he found Hollends ready to welcome him. They had several glasses\ntogether, and Hollends told him of the efforts of the Social League in\nthe reclamation line, and his doubts of their ultimate success.\nHollends seemed to think the ladies of the League were deeply indebted\nto him for furnishing them with such a good subject for reformation.\nThat night Joe's career reached a triumphant climax, for the four\npoliceman had to appeal to the bystanders for help in the name of the\nlaw.\n\nJack Morris went home unaided. He had not taken many glasses, but he\nknew he should have avoided drink altogether, for he had some\nexperience of its power in his younger days. He was, therefore, in a\nquarrelsome mood, ready to blame everyone but himself.\n\nHe found his wife in tears, and saw Miss Johnson sitting there,\nevidently very miserable.\n\n\"What's all this?\" asked Morris.\n\nHis wife dried her eyes, and said it was nothing. Miss Johnson had been\ngiving her some advice, which she was thankful for. Morris glared at\nthe visitor.\n\n\"What have you got to do with us?\" he demanded rudely. His wife caught\nhim by the arm, but he angrily tossed aside her hand. Miss Johnson\narose, fearing.\n\n\"You've no business here. We want none of your advice. You get out of\nthis.\" Then, impatiently to his wife, who strove to calm him, \"Shut up,\nwill you?\"\n\nMiss Johnson was afraid he would strike her as she passed him going to\nthe door, but he merely stood there, following her exit with lowering\nbrow.\n\nThe terrified lady told her experience to the sympathizing members of\nthe committee. She had spoken to Mrs. Morris of her extravagance in\nbuying so many things that were not necessary when her husband had\nwork. She advised the saving of the money. Mrs. Morris had defended her\napparent lavish expenditure by saying that there was no possibility of\nsaving money. She bought useful things, and when her husband was out of\nwork she could always get a large percentage of their cost from the\npawnbroker. The pawnshop, she had tearfully explained to Miss Johnson,\nwas the only bank of the poor. The idea of the pawnshop as a bank, and\nnot as a place of disgrace, was new to Miss Johnson, but before\nanything further could be said the husband had come in. One of the\ncommittee, who knew more about the district than Miss Johnson, affirmed\nthat there was something to say for the pawnbroker as the banker of the\npoor. The committee were unanimous in condemning the conduct of Morris,\nand it says much for the members that, in spite of the provocation one\nof them had received, they did not take the name of so undeserving a\nman from their list of the unemployed.\n\nThe sad relapse of Joe Hollends next occupied the attention of the\nLeague. His fine had been paid, and he had expressed himself as deeply\ngrieved at his own frailty. If the foreman had been less harsh with him\nand had given him a chance, things might have been different. It was\nresolved to send Joe to the seaside so that he might have an\nopportunity of toning up his system to resist temptation. Joe enjoyed\nhis trip to the sea. He always liked to encounter a new body of police\nunaccustomed to his methods. He toned up his system so successfully the\nfirst day on the sands that he spent the night in the cells.\n\nLittle by little, the portable property in the rooms of the Morrises\ndisappeared into the pawnshop. Misfortune, as usual, did not come\nsingly. The small boy was ill, and Morris himself seemed to be unable\nto resist the temptation of the Red Lion. The unhappy woman took her\nboy to the parish doctor, who was very busy, but he gave what attention\nhe could to the case. He said all the boy needed was nourishing food\nand country air. Mrs. Morris sighed, and decided to take the little boy\noftener to the park, but the way was long, and he grew weaker day by\nday.\n\nAt last, she succeeded in interesting her husband in the little\nfellow's condition. He consented to take the boy to the doctor with\nher.\n\n\"The doctor doesn't seem to mind what I say,\" she complained. \"Perhaps\nhe will pay attention to a man.\"\n\nMorris was not naturally a morose person, but continued disappointment\nwas rapidly making him so. He said nothing, but took the boy in his\narms, and, followed by his wife, went to the doctor.\n\n\"This boy was here before,\" said the physician, which tended to show\nthat he had paid more attention to the case than Mrs. Morris thought.\n\"He is very much worse. You will have to take him to the country or he\nwill die.\"\n\n\"How can I send him to the country?\" asked Morris, sullenly. \"I've been\nout of work for months.\"\n\n\"Have you friends in the country?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Hasn't your wife any friends in the country who would take her and the\nlad for a month or so?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Have you anything to pawn?\"\n\n\"Very little.\"\n\n\"Then I would advise you to pawn everything you own, or sell it if you\ncan, and take the boy on your back and tramp to the country. You will\nget work there probably more easily than in the city. Here are ten\nshillings to help you.\"\n\n\"I don't want your money,\" said Morris, in a surly tone. \"I want work.\"\n\n\"I have no work to give you, so I offer you what I have. I haven't as\nmuch of that as I could wish. You are a fool not to take what the gods\nsend.\"\n\nMorris, without replying, gathered up his son in his arms and departed.\n\n\"Here is a bottle of tonic for him.\" said the doctor to Mrs. Morris.\n\nHe placed the half-sovereign on the bottle as he passed it to her. She\nsilently thanked him with her wet eyes, hoping that a time would come\nwhen she could repay the money. The doctor had experience enough to\nknow that they were not to be classed among his usual visitors. He was\nnot in the habit of indiscriminately bestowing gold coins.\n\nIt was a dreary journey, and they were a long time shaking off the\noctopus-like tentacles of the great city, that reached further and\nfurther into he country each year, as if it lived on consuming the\ngreen fields. Morris walked ahead with the boy on his back, and his\nwife followed. Neither spoke, and the sick lad did not complain. As\nthey were nearing a village, the boy's head sunk on his father's\nshoulder. The mother quickened her pace, and came up to them stroking\nthe head of her sleeping son. Suddenly, she uttered a smothered cry and\ntook the boy in her arms.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Morris, turning round.\n\nShe did not answer, but sat by the roadside with the boy on her lap,\nswaying her body to and fro over him, moaning as she did so. Morris\nneeded no answer. He stood on the road with hardening face, and looked\ndown on his wife and child without speaking.\n\nThe kindly villagers arranged the little funeral, and when it was over\nJack Morris and his wife stood again on the road.\n\n\"Jack, dear,\" she pleaded, \"don't go back to that horrible place. We\nbelong to the country, and the city is so hard and cruel.\"\n\n\"I'm going back. You can do as you like.\" Then, relenting a little, he\nadded, \"I haven't brought much luck to you, my girl.\"\n\nShe knew her husband was a stubborn man, and set in his way, so,\nunprotesting, she followed him in, as she had followed out, stumbling\nmany times, for often her eyes did not see the road. And so they\nreturned to their empty rooms.\n\nJack Morris went to look for work at the Red Lion. There he met that\ngenial comrade, Joe Hollends, who had been reformed, and who had\nbackslid twice since Jack had foregathered with him before. It is but\nfair to Joe to admit that he had never been optimistic about his own\nreclamation, but being an obliging man, even when he was sober, he was\nwilling to give the Social League every chance. Jack was deeply grieved\nat the death of his son, although he had said no word to his wife that\nwould show it. It therefore took more liquor than usual to bring him up\nto the point of good comradeship that reigned at the Red Lion. When he\nand Joe left the tavern that night it would have taken an expert to\ntell which was the more inebriated. They were both in good fighting\ntrim, and were both in the humor for a row. The police, who had\nreckoned on Joe alone, suddenly found a new element in the fight that\nnot only upset their calculations but themselves as well. It was a\nglorious victory, and, as both fled down a side street, Morris urged\nHollends to come along, for the representatives of law and order have\nthe habit of getting reinforcements which often turn a victory into a\nmost ignominious defeat.\n\n\"I can't,\" panted Hollends. \"The beggars have hurt me.\"\n\n\"Come along. I know a place where we are safe.\"\n\nDrunk as he was, Jack succeeded in finding the hole in the wall that\nallowed him to enter a vacant spot behind the box factory. There\nHollends lay down with a groan, and there Morris sank beside him in a\ndrunken sleep. The police were at last revenged, and finally.\n\nWhen the grey daylight brought Morris to a dazed sense of where he was,\nhe found his companion dead beside him. He had a vague fear that he\nwould be tried for murder, but it was not so. From the moment that\nHollends, in his fall, struck his head on the curb, the Providence\nwhich looks after the drunken deserted him.\n\nBut the inquest accomplished one good object. It attracted the\nattention of the Social League to Jack Morris, and they are now\nendeavoring to reclaim him.\n\nWhether they succeed or not, he was a man that was certainly once worth\nsaving.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TYPE-WRITTEN LETTER.\n\n\nWhen a man has battled with poverty all his life, fearing it as he\nfought it, feeling for its skinny throat to throttle it, and yet\ndreading all the while the coming of the time when it would gain the\nmastery and throttle him--when such a man is told that he is rich, it\nmight be imagined he would receive the announcement with hilarity. When\nRichard Denham realized that he was wealthy he became even more sobered\nthan usual, and drew a long breath as if he had been running a race and\nhad won it. The man who brought him the news had no idea he had told\nDenham anything novel.\n\nHe merely happened to say, \"You are a rich man, Mr. Denham, and will\nnever miss it.\"\n\nDenham had never before been called a rich man, and up to that moment\nhe had not thought of himself as wealthy. He wrote out the check asked\nof him, and his visitor departed gratefully, leaving the merchant with\nsomething to ponder over. He was as surprised with the suddenness of\nthe thing as if someone had left him a legacy. Yet the money was all of\nhis own accumulating, but his struggle had been so severe, and he had\nbeen so hopeless about it, that from mere habit he exerted all his\nenergies long after the enemy was overcome--just as the troops at New\nOrleans fought a fierce battle not knowing that the war was over. He\nhad sprung from such a hopelessly poor family. Poverty had been their\ninheritance from generation to generation. It was the invariable legacy\nthat father had left to son in the Denham family. All had accepted\ntheir lot with uncomplaining resignation, until Richard resolved he\nwould at least have a fight for it. And now the fight had been won.\nDenham sat in his office staring at the dingy wall-paper so long, that\nRogers, the chief clerk, put his head in and said in a deferential\nvoice:\n\n\"Anything more to-night, Mr. Denham?\"\n\nDenham started as if that question in that tone had not been asked him\nevery night for years.\n\n\"What's that, what's that?\" he cried.\n\nRogers was astonished, but too well trained to show it.\n\n\"Anything more to-night, Mr. Denham?\"\n\n\"Ah, quite so. No, Rogers, thank you, nothing more.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Mr. Denham.\"\n\n\"Eh? Oh, yes. Good-night, Rogers, good-night.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Denham left his office and went out into the street everything\nhad an unusual appearance to him. He walked along, unheeding the\ndirection. He looked at the fine residences and realized that he might\nhave a fine residence if he wanted it. He saw handsome carriages; he\ntoo might set up an equipage. The satisfaction these thoughts produced\nwas brief. Of what use would a fine house or an elegant carriage be to\nhim? He knew no one to invite to the house or to ride with him in the\ncarriage. He began to realize how utterly alone in the world he was. He\nhad no friends, no acquaintances even. The running dog, with its nose\nto the ground, sees nothing of the surrounding scenery. He knew men in\na business way, of course, and doubtless each of them had a home in the\nsuburbs somewhere, but he could not take a business man by the\nshoulders and say to him, \"Invite me to your house; I am lonely; I want\nto know people.\"\n\nIf he got such an invitation, he would not know what to do with\nhimself. He was familiar with the counting-room and its language, but\nthe drawing-room was an unexplored country to him, where an unknown\ntongue was spoken. On the road to wealth he had missed something, and\nit was now too late to go back for it. Only the day before, he had\nheard one of the clerks, who did not know he was within earshot, allude\nto him as \"the old man.\" He felt as young as ever he did, but the\nphrase, so lightly spoken, made him catch his breath.\n\nAs he was now walking through the park, and away from the busy streets,\nhe took off his hat and ran his fingers through his grizzled hair,\nlooking at his hand when he had done so, as if the grey, like wet\npaint, might have come off. He thought of a girl he knew once, who\nperhaps would have married him if he had asked her, as he was tempted\nto do. But that had always been the mistake of the Denhams. They had\nall married young except himself, and so sunk deeper into the mire of\npoverty, pressed down by a rapidly-increasing progeny. The girl had\nmarried a baker, he remembered. Yes, that was a long time ago. The\nclerk was not far wrong when he called him an old man. Suddenly,\nanother girl arose before his mental vision--a modern girl--very\ndifferent indeed to the one who married the baker. She was the only\nwoman in the world with whom he was on speaking terms, and he knew her\nmerely because her light and nimble fingers played the business sonata\nof one note on his office typewriter. Miss Gale was pretty, of course--\nall typewriter girls are--and it was generally understood in the office\nthat she belonged to a good family who had come down in the world. Her\nsomewhat independent air deepened this conviction and kept the clerks\nat a distance. She was a sensible girl who realized that the typewriter\npaid better than the piano, and accordingly turned the expertness of\nher white fingers to the former instrument. Richard Denham sat down\nupon a park bench. \"Why not?\" he asked himself. There was no reason\nagainst it except that he felt he had not the courage. Nevertheless, he\nformed a desperate resolution.\n\nNext day, business went on as usual. Letters were answered, and the\ntime arrived when Miss Gale came in to see if he had any further\ncommands that day. Denham hesitated. He felt vaguely that a business\noffice was not the proper place for a proposal; yet he knew he would be\nat a disadvantage anywhere else. In the first place, he had no\nplausible excuse for calling upon the young woman at home, and, in the\nsecond place, he knew if he once got there he would be stricken dumb.\nIt must either be at his office or nowhere.\n\n\"Sit down a moment, Miss Gale,\" he said at last; \"I wanted to consult\nyou about a matter--about a business matter.\"\n\nMiss Gale seated herself, and automatically placed on her knee the\nshorthand writing-pad ready to take down his instructions. She looked\nup at him expectantly. Denham, in an embarrassed manner, ran his\nfingers through his hair.\n\n\"I am thinking,\" he began, \"of taking a partner. The business is very\nprosperous now. In fact, it has been so for some time.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said Miss Gale interrogatively.\n\n\"Yes. I think I should have a partner. It is about that I wanted to\nspeak to you.\"\n\n\"Don't you think it would be better to consult with Mr. Rogers? He\nknows more about business than I. But perhaps it is Mr. Rogers who is\nto be the partner?\"\n\n\"No, it is not Rogers. Rogers is a good man. But--it is not Rogers.\"\n\n\"Then I think in an important matter like this Mr. Rogers, or someone\nwho knows the business as thoroughly as he does, would be able to give\nyou advice that would be of some value.\"\n\n\"I don't want advice exactly. I have made up my mind to have a partner,\nif the partner is willing.\"\n\nDenham mopped his brow. It was going to be even more difficult than he\nhad anticipated.\n\n\"Is it, then, a question of the capital the partner is to bring in?\"\nasked Miss Gale, anxious to help him.\n\n\"No, no. I don't wish any capital. I have enough for both. And the\nbusiness is very prosperous, Miss Gale--and--and has been.\"\n\nThe young woman raised her eyebrows in surprise.\n\n\"You surely don't intend to share the profits with a partner who brings\nno capital into the business?\"\n\n\"Yes--yes, I do. You see, as I said, I have no need for more capital.\"\n\n\"Oh, if that is the case, I think you should consult Mr. Rogers before\nyou commit yourself.\"\n\n\"But Rogers wouldn't understand.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't understand either. It seems to me a foolish thing\nto do--that is, if you want my advice.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I want it. But it isn't as foolish as you think. I should\nhave had a partner long ago. That is where I made the mistake. I've\nmade up my mind on that.\"\n\n\"Then I don't see that I can be of any use--if your mind is already\nmade up.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you can. I'm a little afraid that my offer may not be\naccepted.\"\n\n\"It is sure to be, if the man has any sense. No fear of such an offer\nbeing refused! Offers like that are not to be had every day. It will be\naccepted.\"\n\n\"Do you really think so, Miss Gale? I am glad that is your opinion.\nNow, what I wanted to consult you about, is the form of the offer. I\nwould like to put it--well--delicately, you know, so that it would not\nbe refused, nor give offence.\"\n\n\"I see. You want me to write a letter to him?\"\n\n\"Exactly, exactly,\" cried Denham with some relief. He had not thought\nof sending a letter before. Now, he wondered why he had not thought of\nit. It was so evidently the best way out of a situation that was\nextremely disconcerting.\n\n\"Have you spoken to him about it?\"\n\n\"To him? What him?\"\n\n\"To your future partner, about the proposal?\"\n\n\"No, no. Oh, no. That is--I have spoken to nobody but you.\"\n\n\"And you are determined not to speak to Mr. Rogers before you write?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. It's none of Roger's business.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" said Miss Gale shortly, bending over her writing-pad.\n\nIt was evident that her opinion of Denham's wisdom was steadily\nlowering. Suddenly, she looked up.\n\n\"How much shall I say the annual profits are? Or do you want that\nmentioned?\"\n\n\"I--I don't think I would mention that. You see, I don't wish this\narrangement to be carried out on a monetary basis--not altogether.\"\n\n\"On what basis then?\"\n\n\"Well--I can hardly say. On a personal basis, perhaps. I rather hope\nthat the person--that my partner--would, you know, like to be\nassociated with me.\"\n\n\"On a friendly basis, do you mean?\" asked Miss Gale, mercilessly.\n\n\"Certainly. Friendly, of course--and perhaps more than that.\"\n\nMiss Gale looked up at him with a certain hopelessness of expression.\n\n\"Why not write a note inviting your future partner to call upon you\nhere, or anywhere else that would be convenient, and then discuss the\nmatter?\"\n\nDenham looked frightened.\n\n\"I thought of that, but it wouldn't do. No; it wouldn't do. I would\nmuch rather settle everything by correspondence.\"\n\n\"I am afraid I shall not be able to compose a letter that will suit\nyou. There seem to be so many difficulties. It is very unusual.\"\n\n\"That is true, and that is why I knew no one but you could help me,\nMiss Gale. If it pleases you, it will please me.\"\n\nMiss Gale shook her head, but, after a few moments, she said, \"How will\nthis do?\"\n\n\"Dear Sir\"--\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" cried Mr. Denham; \"that seems rather a formal opening,\ndoesn't it? How would it read if you put it 'Dear friend'?\"\n\n\"If you wish it so.\" She crossed out the \"sir\" and substituted the word\nsuggested. Then, she read the letter:\n\n\"Dear Friend,--I have for some time past been desirous of taking a\npartner, and would be glad if you would consider the question and\nconsent to join me in this business. The business is, and has been for\nseveral years, very prosperous, and, as I shall require no capital from\nyou, I think you will find my offer a very advantageous one. I will----\"\n\n\"I--I don't think I would put it quite that way.\" said Denham, with\nsome hesitation. \"It reads as if I were offering everything, and that\nmy partner--well, you see what I mean.\"\n\n\"It's the truth,\" said Miss Gale, defiantly.\n\n\"Better put it on the friendly basis, as you suggested a moment ago.\"\n\n\"I didn't suggest anything, Mr. Denham. Perhaps it would be better if\nyou would dictate the letter exactly as you want it. I knew I could not\nwrite one that would please you.\"\n\n\"It does please me, but I'm thinking of my future partner. You are\ndoing first-rate--better than I could do. But just put it on the\nfriendly basis.\"\n\nA moment later she read:\n\n\"... join me in this business. I make you this offer entirely from a\nfriendly, and not from a financial, standpoint, hoping that you like me\nwell enough to be associated with me.\"\n\n\"Anything else, Mr. Denham?\"\n\n\"No. I think that covers the whole ground. It will look rather short,\ntype-written, won't it? Perhaps you might add something to show that I\nshall be exceedingly disappointed if my offer is not accepted.\"\n\n\"No fear,\" said Miss Gale. \"I'll add that though. 'Yours truly,' or\n'Yours very truly'?\"\n\n\"You might end it 'Your friend.'\"\n\nThe rapid click of the typewriter was heard for a few moments in the\nnext room, and then Miss Gale came out with the completed letter in her\nhand.\n\n\"Shall I have the boy copy it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, bless you, no!\" answered Mr. Denham, with evident trepidation.\n\nThe young woman said to herself, \"He doesn't want Mr. Rogers to know,\nand no wonder. It is a most unbusiness-like proposal.\"\n\nThen she said aloud, \"Shall you want me again to-day?\"\n\n\"No, Miss Gale; and thank you very much.\"\n\nNext morning, Miss Gale came into Mr. Denham's office with a smile on\nher face.\n\n\"You made a funny mistake last night, Mr. Denham,\" she said, as she\ntook off her wraps.\n\n\"Did I?\" he asked, in alarm.\n\n\"Yes. You sent that letter to my address. I got it this morning. I\nopened it, for I thought it was for me, and that perhaps you did not\nneed me to-day. But I saw at once that you put it in the wrong\nenvelope. Did you want me to-day?\"\n\nIt was on his tongue to say, \"I want you every day,\" but he merely held\nout his hand for the letter, and looked at it as if he could not\naccount for its having gone astray.\n\nThe next day Miss Gale came late, and she looked frightened. It was\nevident that Denham was losing his mind. She put the letter down before\nhim and said:\n\n\"You addressed that to me the second time, Mr. Denham.\"\n\nThere was a look of haggard anxiety about Denham that gave color to her\nsuspicions. He felt that it was now or never.\n\n\"Then why don't you answer it, Miss Gale?\" he said gruffly.\n\nShe backed away from him.\n\n\"Answer it?\" she repeated faintly.\n\n\"Certainly. If I got a letter twice, I would answer it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she cried, with her hand on the door-knob.\n\n\"Exactly what the letter says. I want you for my partner. I want to\nmarry you, and d--n financial considerations----\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Miss Gale, in a long-drawn, quivering sigh. She was\ndoubtless shocked at the word he had used, and fled to her typewriting\nroom, closing the door behind her.\n\nRichard Denham paced up and down the floor for a few moments, then\nrapped lightly at her door, but there was no response. He put on his\nhat and went out into the street. After a long and aimless walk, he\nfound himself again at his place of business. When he went in, Rogers\nsaid to him:\n\n\"Miss Gale has left, sir.\"\n\n\"Has she?\"\n\n\"Yes, and she has given notice. Says she is not coming back, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nHe went into his own room and found a letter marked \"personal\" on his\ndesk. He tore it open, and read in neatly type-written characters:\n\n\n\"I have resigned my place as typewriter girl, having been offered a\nbetter situation. I am offered a partnership in the house of Richard\nDenham. I have decided to accept the position, not so much on account\nof its financial attractions, as because I shall be glad, on a friendly\nbasis, to be associated with the gentleman I have named. Why did you\nput me to all that worry writing that idiotic letter, when a few words\nwould have saved ever so much bother? You evidently _need_ a\npartner. My mother will be pleased to meet you any time you call. You\nhave the address,--Your friend,\n\n                                   \"MARGARET GALE.\"\n\n\n\"Rogers!\" shouted Denham, joyfully.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered that estimable man, putting his head into the\nroom.\n\n\"Advertise for another typewriter girl, Rogers.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Rogers.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOOM OF LONDON.\n\n\nI.--THE SELF-CONCEIT OF THE 20TH CENTURY.\n\nI trust I am thankful my life has been spared until I have seen that\nmost brilliant epoch of the world's history--the middle of the 20th\ncentury. It would be useless for any man to disparage the vast\nachievements of the past fifty years, and if I venture to call\nattention to the fact, now apparently forgotten, that the people of the\n19th century succeeded in accomplishing many notable things, it must\nnot be imagined that I intend thereby to discount in any measure the\nmarvellous inventions of the present age. Men have always been somewhat\nprone to look with a certain condescension upon those who lived fifty\nor a hundred years before them. This seems to me the especial weakness\nof the present age; a feeling of national self-conceit, which, when it\nexists, should at least be kept as much in the background as possible.\nIt will astonish many to know that such also was a failing of the\npeople of the 19th century. They imagined themselves living in an age\nof progress, and while I am not foolish enough to attempt to prove that\nthey did anything really worth recording, yet it must be admitted by\nany unprejudiced man of research that their inventions were at least\nstepping-stones to those of to-day. Although the telephone and\ntelegraph, and all other electrical appliances, are now to be found\nonly in our national museums, or in the private collections of those\nfew men who take any interest in the doings of the last century,\nnevertheless, the study of the now obsolete science of electricity led\nup to the recent discovery of vibratory ether which does the work of\nthe world so satisfactorily. The people of the 19th century were not\nfools, and although I am well aware that this statement will be\nreceived with scorn where it attracts any attention whatever, yet who\ncan say that the progress of the next half-century may not be as great\nas that of the one now ended, and that the people of the next century\nmay not look upon us with the same contempt which we feel toward those\nwho lived fifty years ago?\n\nBeing an old man, I am, perhaps, a laggard who dwells in the past\nrather than the present; still, it seems to me that such an article as\nthat which appeared recently in _Blackwood_ from the talented pen\nof Prof. Mowberry, of Oxford University, is utterly unjustifiable.\nUnder the title of \"Did the People of London Deserve their Fate?\" he\nendeavors to show that the simultaneous blotting out of millions of\nhuman beings was a beneficial event, the good results of which we still\nenjoy. According to him, Londoners were so dull-witted and stupid, so\nincapable of improvement, so sodden in the vice of mere money-\ngathering, that nothing but their total extinction would have sufficed,\nand that, instead of being an appalling catastrophe, the doom of London\nwas an unmixed blessing. In spite of the unanimous approval with which\nthis article has been received by the press, I still maintain that such\nwriting is uncalled for, and that there is something to be said for the\nLondon of the 19th century.\n\n\n\n\nII.--WHY LONDON, WARNED, WAS UNPREPARED.\n\n\nThe indignation I felt in first reading the article alluded to still\nremains with me, and it has caused me to write these words, giving some\naccount of what I must still regard, in spite of the sneers of the\npresent age, as the most terrible disaster that ever overtook a portion\nof the human race. I shall not endeavor to place before those who read,\nany record of the achievements pertaining to the time in question. But\nI would like to say a few words about the alleged stupidity of the\npeople of London in making no preparations for a disaster regarding\nwhich they had continual and ever-recurring warning. They have been\ncompared with the inhabitants of Pompeii making merry at the foot of a\nvolcano. In the first place, fogs were so common in London, especially\nin winter, that no particular attention was paid to them. They were\nmerely looked upon as inconvenient annoyances, interrupting traffic and\nprejudicial to health, but I doubt if anyone thought it possible for a\nfog to become one vast smothering mattress pressed down upon a whole\nmetropolis, extinguishing life as if the city suffered from hopeless\nhydrophobia. I have read that victims bitten by mad dogs were formerly\nput out of their sufferings in that way, although I doubt much if such\nthings were ever actually done, notwithstanding the charges of savage\nbarbarity now made against the people of the 19th century.\n\nProbably, the inhabitants of Pompeii were so accustomed to the\neruptions of Vesuvius that they gave no thought to the possibility of\ntheir city being destroyed by a storm of ashes and an overflow of lava.\nRain frequently descended upon London, and if a rainfall continued long\nenough it would certainly have flooded the metropolis, but no\nprecautions were taken against a flood from the clouds. Why, then,\nshould the people have been expected to prepare for a catastrophe from\nfog, such as there had never been any experience of in the world's\nhistory? The people of London were far from being the sluggish dolts\npresent-day writers would have us believe.\n\n\n\n\nIII.--THE COINCIDENCE THAT CAME AT LAST.\n\n\nAs fog has now been abolished both on sea and land, and as few of the\npresent generation have even seen one, it may not be out of place to\ngive a few lines on the subject of fogs in general, and the London fogs\nin particular, which through local peculiarities differed from all\nothers. A fog was simply watery vapor rising from the marshy surface of\nthe land or from the sea, or condensed into a cloud from the saturated\natmosphere. In my day, fogs were a great danger at sea, for people then\ntravelled by means of steamships that sailed upon the surface of the\nocean.\n\nLondon at the end of the 19th century consumed vast quantities of a\nsoft bituminous coal for the purpose of heating rooms and of preparing\nfood. In the morning and during the day, clouds of black smoke were\npoured forth from thousands of chimneys. When a mass of white vapor\narose in the night these clouds of smoke fell upon the fog, pressing it\ndown, filtering slowly through it, and adding to its density. The sun\nwould have absorbed the fog but for the layer of smoke that lay thick\nabove the vapor and prevented the rays reaching it. Once this condition\nof things prevailed, nothing could clear London but a breeze of wind\nfrom any direction. London frequently had a seven days' fog, and\nsometimes a seven days' calm, but these two conditions never coincided\nuntil the last year of the last century. The coincidence, as everyone\nknows, meant death--death so wholesale that no war the earth has ever\nseen left such slaughter behind it. To understand the situation, one\nhas only to imagine the fog as taking the place of the ashes at\nPompeii, and the coal-smoke as being the lava that covered it. The\nresult to the inhabitants in both cases was exactly the same.\n\n\n\n\nIV.--THE AMERICAN WHO WANTED TO SELL.\n\n\nI was at the time confidential clerk to the house of Fulton, Brixton &\nCo., a firm in Cannon Street, dealing largely in chemicals and chemical\napparatus. Fulton I never knew; he died long before my time. Sir John\nBrixton was my chief, knighted, I believe, for services to his party,\nor because he was an official in the City during some royal progress\nthrough it; I have forgotten which. My small room was next to his large\none, and my chief duty was to see that no one had an interview with Sir\nJohn unless he was an important man or had important business. Sir John\nwas a difficult man to see, and a difficult man to deal with when he\nwas seen. He had little respect for most men's feelings, and none at\nall for mine. If I allowed a man to enter his room who should have been\ndealt with by one of the minor members of the company, Sir John made no\neffort to conceal his opinion of me. One day, in the autumn of the last\nyear of the century, an American was shown into my room. Nothing would\ndo but he must have an interview with Sir John Brixton. I told him that\nit was impossible, as Sir John was extremely busy, but that if he\nexplained his business to me I would lay it before Sir John at the\nfirst favorable opportunity. The American demurred at this, but finally\naccepted the inevitable. He was the inventor, he said, of a machine\nthat would revolutionize life in London, and he wanted Fulton, Brixton\n& Co. to become agents for it. The machine, which he had in a small\nhandbag with him, was of white metal, and it was so constructed that by\nturning an index it gave out greater or less volumes of oxygen gas. The\ngas, I understood, was stored in the interior in liquid form under\ngreat pressure, and would last, if I remember rightly, for six months\nwithout recharging. There was also a rubber tube with a mouthpiece\nattached to it, and the American said that if a man took a few whiffs a\nday, he would experience beneficial results. Now, I knew there was not\nthe slightest use in showing the machine to Sir John, because we dealt\nin old-established British apparatus, and never in any of the new-\nfangled Yankee contraptions. Besides, Sir John had a prejudice against\nAmericans, and I felt sure this man would exasperate him, as he was a\nmost cadaverous specimen of the race, with high nasal tones, and a most\ndeplorable pronunciation, much given to phrases savoring of slang; and\nhe exhibited also a certain nervous familiarity of demeanor towards\npeople to whom he was all but a complete stranger. It was impossible\nfor me to allow such a man to enter the presence of Sir John Brixton,\nand when he returned some days later I explained to him, I hope with\ncourtesy, that the head of the house regretted very much his inability\nto consider his proposal regarding the machine. The ardor of the\nAmerican seemed in no way dampened by this rebuff. He said I could not\nhave explained the possibilities of the apparatus properly to Sir John;\nhe characterized it as a great invention, and said it meant a fortune\nto whoever obtained the agency for it. He hinted that other noted\nLondon houses were anxious to secure it, but for some reason not stated\nhe preferred to deal with us. He left some printed pamphlets referring\nto the invention, and said he would call again.\n\n\n\n\nV.--THE AMERICAN SEES SIR JOHN.\n\n\nMany a time I have since thought of that persistent American, and\nwondered whether he left London before the disaster, or was one of the\nunidentified thousands who were buried in unmarked graves. Little did\nSir John think when he expelled him with some asperity from his\npresence, that he was turning away an offer of life, and that the\nheated words he used were, in reality, a sentence of death upon\nhimself. For my own part, I regret that I lost my temper, and told the\nAmerican his business methods did not commend themselves to me. Perhaps\nhe did not feel the sting of this; indeed, I feel certain he did not,\nfor, unknowingly, he saved my life. Be that as it may, he showed no\nresentment, but immediately asked me out to drink with him, an offer I\nwas compelled to refuse. But I am getting ahead of my story. Indeed,\nbeing unaccustomed to writing, it is difficult for me to set down\nevents in their proper sequence. The American called upon me several\ntimes after I told him our house could not deal with him. He got into\nthe habit of dropping in upon me unannounced, which I did not at all\nlike, but I gave no instructions regarding his intrusions, because I\nhad no idea of the extremes to which he was evidently prepared to go.\nOne day, as he sat near my desk reading a paper, I was temporarily\ncalled from the room. When I returned I thought he had gone, taking his\nmachine with him, but a moment later I was shocked to hear his high\nnasal tones in Sir John's room alternating with the deep notes of my\nchief's voice, which apparently exercised no such dread upon the\nAmerican as upon those who were more accustomed to them. I at once\nentered the room, and was about to explain to Sir John that the\nAmerican was there through no connivance of mine, when my chief asked\nme to be silent, and, turning to his visitor, gruffly requested him to\nproceed with his interesting narration. The inventor needed no second\ninvitation, but went on with his glib talk, while Sir John's frown grew\ndeeper, and his face became redder under his fringe of white hair. When\nthe American had finished, Sir John roughly bade him begone, and take\nhis accursed machine with him. He said it was an insult for a person\nwith one foot in the grave to bring a so-called health invention to a\nrobust man who never had a day's illness, I do not know why he listened\nso long to the American, when he had made up his mind from the first\nnot to deal with him, unless it was to punish me for inadvertently\nallowing the stranger to enter. The interview distressed me\nexceedingly, as I stood there helpless, knowing Sir John was becoming\nmore and more angry with every word the foreigner uttered, but, at\nlast, I succeeded in drawing the inventor and his work into my own room\nand closing the door. I sincerely hoped I would never see the American\nagain, and my wish was gratified. He insisted on setting his machine\ngoing, and placing it on a shelf in my room. He asked me to slip it\ninto Sir John's room some foggy day and note the effect. The man said\nhe would call again, but he never did.\n\n\n\n\nVI.--HOW THE SMOKE HELD DOWN THE FOG.\n\n\nIt was on a Friday that the fog came down upon us. The weather was very\nfine up to the middle of November that autumn. The fog did not seem to\nhave anything unusual about it. I have seen many worse fogs than that\nappeared to be. As day followed day, however, the atmosphere became\ndenser and darker, caused, I suppose, by the increasing volume of coal-\nsmoke poured out upon it. The peculiarity about those seven days was\nthe intense stillness of the air. We were, although we did not know it,\nunder an air-proof canopy, and were slowly but surely exhausting the\nlife-giving oxygen around us, and replacing it by poisonous carbonic\nacid gas. Scientific men have since showed that a simple mathematical\ncalculation might have told us exactly when the last atom of oxygen\nwould have been consumed; but it is easy to be wise after the event.\nThe body of the greatest mathematician in England was found in the\nStrand. He came that morning from Cambridge. During the fog there was\nalways a marked increase in the death rate, and on this occasion the\nincrease was no greater than usual until the sixth day. The newspapers\non the morning of the seventh were full of startling statistics, but at\nthe time of going to press the full significance of the alarming figures\nwas not realized. The editorials of the morning papers on the seventh\nday contained no warning of the calamity that was so speedily to follow\ntheir appearance. I lived then at Ealing, a Western suburb of London,\nand came every morning to Cannon Street by a certain train. I had up to\nthe sixth day experienced no inconvenience from the fog, and this was\nlargely due, I am convinced, to the unnoticed operations of the\nAmerican machine.\n\nOn the fifth and sixth days Sir John did not come to the City, but he\nwas in his office on the seventh. The door between his room and mine\nwas closed. Shortly after ten o'clock I heard a cry in his room,\nfollowed by a heavy fall. I opened the door, and saw Sir John lying\nface downwards on the floor. Hastening towards him, I felt for the\nfirst time the deadly effect of the deoxygenized atmosphere, and before\nI reached him I fell first on one knee and then headlong. I realized\nthat my senses were leaving me, and instinctively crawled back to my\nown room, where the oppression was at once lifted, and I stood again\nupon my feet, gasping. I closed the door of Sir John's room, thinking\nit filled with poisonous fumes, as, indeed, it was. I called loudly for\nhelp, but there was no answer. On opening the door to the main office I\nmet again what I thought was the noxious vapor. Speedily as I closed\nthe door, I was impressed by the intense silence of the usually busy\noffice, and saw that some of the clerks were motionless on the floor,\nand others sat with their heads on their desks as if asleep. Even at\nthis awful moment I did not realize that what I saw was common to all\nLondon, and not, as I imagined, a local disaster, caused by the\nbreaking of some carboys in our cellar. (It was filled with chemicals\nof every kind, of whose properties I was ignorant, dealing as I did\nwith the accountant, and not the scientific side of our business.) I\nopened the only window in my room, and again shouted for help. The\nstreet was silent and dark in the ominously still fog, and what now\nfroze me with horror was meeting the same deadly, stifling atmosphere\nthat was in the rooms. In falling I brought down the window, and shut\nout the poisonous air. Again I revived, and slowly the true state of\nthings began to dawn upon me.\n\nI was in an oasis of oxygen. I at once surmised that the machine on my\nshelf was responsible for the existence of this oasis in a vast desert\nof deadly gas. I took down the American's machine, fearful in moving it\nthat I might stop its working. Taking the mouthpiece between my lips I\nagain entered Sir John's room, this time without feeling any ill\neffects. My poor master was long beyond human help. There was evidently\nno one alive in the building except myself. Out in the street all was\nsilent and dark. The gas was extinguished, but here and there in shops\nthe incandescent lights were still weirdly burning, depending, as they\ndid, on accumulators, and not on direct engine power. I turned\nautomatically towards Cannon Street Station, knowing my way to it even\nif blindfolded, stumbling over bodies prone on the pavement, and in\ncrossing the street I ran against a motionless 'bus, spectral in the\nfog, with dead horses lying in front, and their reins dangling from the\nnerveless hand of a dead driver. The ghostlike passengers, equally\nsilent, sat bolt upright, or hung over the edge boards in attitudes\nhorribly grotesque.\n\n\n\n\nVII.--THE TRAIN WITH ITS TRAIL OF THE DEAD.\n\n\nIf a man's reasoning faculties were alert at such a time (I confess\nmine were dormant), he would have known there could be no trains at\nCannon Street Station, for if there was not enough oxygen in the air to\nkeep a man alive, or a gas-jet alight, there would certainly not be\nenough to enable an engine fire to burn, even if the engineer retained\nsufficient energy to attend to his task. At times instinct is better\nthan reason, and it proved so in this case. The railway from Ealing in\nthose days came under the City in a deep tunnel. It would appear that\nin this underground passage the carbonic acid gas would first find a\nresting-place on account of its weight; but such was not the fact. I\nimagine that a current through the tunnel brought from the outlying\ndistricts a supply of comparatively pure air that, for some minutes\nafter the general disaster, maintained human life. Be this as it may,\nthe long platforms of Cannon Street Underground Station presented a\nfearful spectacle. A train stood at the down platform. The electric\nlights burned fitfully. This platform was crowded with men, who fought\neach other like demons, apparently for no reason, because the train was\nalready packed as full as it could hold. Hundreds were dead under foot,\nand every now and then a blast of foul air came along the tunnel,\nwhereupon hundreds more would relax their grips, and succumb. Over\ntheir bodies the survivors fought, with continually thinning ranks. It\nseemed to me that most of those in the standing train were dead.\nSometimes a desperate body of fighters climbed over those lying in\nheaps and, throwing open a carriage door, hauled out passengers already\nin, and took their places, gasping. Those in the train offered no\nresistance, and lay motionless where they were flung, or rolled\nhelplessly under the wheels of the train. I made my way along the wall\nas well as I could to the engine, wondering why the train did not go.\nThe engineer lay on the floor of his cab, and the fires were out.\n\nCustom is a curious thing. The struggling mob, fighting wildly for\nplaces in the carriages, were so accustomed to trains arriving and\ndeparting that it apparently occurred to none of them that the engineer\nwas human and subject to the same atmospheric conditions as themselves.\nI placed the mouthpiece between his purple lips, and, holding my own\nbreath like a submerged man, succeeded in reviving him. He said that if\nI gave him the machine he would take out the train as far as the steam\nalready in the boiler would carry it. I refused to do this, but stepped\non the engine with him, saying it would keep life in both of us until\nwe got out into better air. In a surly manner he agreed to this and\nstarted the train, but he did not play fair. Each time he refused to\ngive up the machine until I was in a fainting condition with holding in\nmy breath, and, finally, he felled me to the floor of the cab. I\nimagine that the machine rolled off the train as I fell and that he\njumped after it. The remarkable thing is that neither of us needed the\nmachine, for I remember that just after we started I noticed through\nthe open iron door that the engine fire suddenly became aglow again,\nalthough at the time I was in too great a state of bewilderment and\nhorror to understand what it meant. A western gale had sprung up--an\nhour too late. Even before we left Cannon Street those who still\nsurvived were comparatively safe, for one hundred and sixty-seven\npersons were rescued from that fearful heap of dead on the platforms,\nalthough many died within a day or two after, and others never\nrecovered their reason. When I regained my senses after the blow dealt\nby the engineer, I found myself alone, and the train speeding across\nthe Thames near Kew. I tried to stop the engine, but did not succeed.\nHowever, in experimenting, I managed to turn on the air brake, which in\nsome degree checked the train, and lessened the impact when the crash\ncame at Richmond terminus. I sprang off on the platform before the\nengine reached the terminal buffers, and saw passing me like a\nnightmare the ghastly trainload of the dead. Most of the doors were\nswinging open, and every compartment was jammed full, although, as I\nafterwards learned, at each curve of the permanent way, or extra lurch\nof the train, bodies had fallen out all along the line. The smash at\nRichmond made no difference to the passengers. Besides myself, only two\npersons were taken alive from the train, and one of these, his clothes\ntorn from his back in the struggle was sent to an asylum, where he was\nnever able to tell who he was; neither, as far as I know, did anyone\never claim him.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PREDICAMENT OF DE PLONVILLE.\n\n\nThis story differs from others in having an assortment of morals. Most\nstories have one moral; here are several. The moral usually appears at\nthe end--in this case a few are mentioned at the beginning, so that\nthey may be looked out for as the reading progresses. First: it is well\nfor a man--especially a young man--to attend to his own business.\nSecond: in planning a person's life for some little distance ahead, it\nwill be a mistake if an allowance of ten per cent. at least, is not\nmade for that unknown quantity--woman. Third: it is beneficial to\nremember that one man rarely knows everything. Other morals will\ndoubtless present themselves, and at the end the cynically-inclined\nperson may reflect upon the adage about the frying-pan and the fire.\n\nYoung M. de Plonville of Paris enjoyed a most enviable position. He had\nall the money he needed, which is quite a different thing from saying\nhe had all the money he wanted. He was well educated, and spoke three\nlanguages, that is, he spoke his own well and the other two badly, but\nas a man always prides himself on what he is least able to do, De\nPlonville fancied himself a linguist. His courage in speaking English\nto Englishmen and German to Germans showed that he was, at least, a\nbrave man. There was a great deal of good and even of talent in De\nPlonville. This statement is made at the beginning, because everyone\nwho knows De Plonville will at once unhesitatingly contradict it. His\nacquaintances thought him one of the most objectionable young men in\nParis, and naval officers, when his name was mentioned, usually gave\nthemselves over to strong and unjustifiable language. This was all on\naccount of De Plonville's position, which, although enviable had its\ndrawbacks.\n\nHis rank in the navy was such that it entitled him to no consideration\nwhatever, but, unfortunately for his own popularity, De Plonville had a\nmethod of giving force to his suggestions. His father was a very big\nman in the French Government. He was so big a man that he could send a\ncensure to the commander of a squadron in the navy, and the commander\ndare not talk back. It takes a very big man indeed to do this, and that\nwas the elder De Plonville's size. But then it was well known that the\nelder De Plonville was an easy-going man who loved comfort, and did not\ncare to trouble himself too much about the navy in his charge, and so\nwhen there was trouble, young De Plonville got the credit of it;\nconsequently, the love of the officers did not flow out to him.\n\nOften young De Plonville's idiotic impetuosity gave color to these\nsuspicions. For instance, there is the well-known Toulon incident. In a\nheated controversy young De Plonville had claimed that the firing of\nthe French ironclads was something execrable, and that the whole fleet\ncould not hold their own at the cannon with any ten of the British\nnavy. Some time after, the naval officers learned that the Government\nat Paris was very much displeased with the inaccurate gun practice of\nthe fleet, and the hope was expressed that the commander would see his\nway to improving it. Of course, the officers could do nothing but gnash\ntheir teeth, try to shoot better, and hope for a time to come when the\nGovernment then in power would be out, and they could find some\ntangible pretence for hanging young De Plonville from the yard-arm.\n\nAll this has only a remote bearing upon this story, but we now come to\na matter on which the story sinks or swims. De Plonville had a secret--\nnot such a secret as is common in Parisian life, but one entirely\ncreditable to him. It related to an invention intended to increase the\nefficiency of the French army. The army being a branch of the defences\nof his country with which De Plonville had nothing whatever to do, his\nattention naturally turned towards it. He spoke of this invention,\nonce, to a friend, a lieutenant in the army. He expected to get some\npractical suggestions. He never mentioned it again to anyone.\n\n\"It is based on the principle of the umbrella,\" he said to his friend;\n\"in fact, it was the umbrella that suggested it to me. If it could be\nmade very light so as not to add seriously to the impedimenta at\npresent carried by the soldier, it seems to me it would be exceedingly\nuseful. Instead of being circular as an umbrella is, it must be oblong\nwith sharp ends. It would have to be arranged so as to be opened and\nclosed quickly, with the cloth thin, but impervious to water. When the\narmy reached a river each soldier could open this, place it in the\nwater, enter it with some care, and then paddle himself across with the\nbutt-end of his gun, or even with a light paddle, if the carrying of it\nadded but little to the weight, thus saving the building of temporary\nbridges. It seems to me such an invention ought to be of vast use in a\nforced march. Then at night it might be used as a sort of tent, or in a\nheavy rain it would form a temporary shelter. What do you think of the\nidea?\" His friend had listened with half-closed eyes. He blew a whiff\nof cigarette smoke from his nostrils and answered:\n\n\"It is wonderful, De Plonville,\" he said drawlingly. \"Its possibilities\nare vast--more so than even you appear to think. It would be very\nuseful in our Alpine corps as well.\"\n\n\"I am glad you think so. But why there?\"\n\n\"Well, you see, if the army reached a high peak looking into a deep\nvalley, only to be reached over an inaccessible precipice, all the army\nwould have to do would be to spread out your superb invention and use\nit as a parachute. The sight of the army of France gradually floating\ndown into the valley would be so terrifying to the nations of Europe,\nthat I imagine no enemy would wait for a gun to be fired. De Plonville,\nyour invention will immortalize you, and immortalize the French army.\"\n\nYoung De Plonville waited to hear no more, but turned on his heel and\nstrode away.\n\nThis conversation caused young De Plonville to make two resolutions;\nfirst, to mention his scheme to no one; second, to persevere and\nperfect his invention, thus causing confusion to the scoffer. There\nwere several sub-resolutions dependent on these two. He would not enter\na club, he would abjure society, he would not speak to a woman--he\nwould, in short, be a hermit until his invention stood revealed before\nan astonished world.\n\nAll of which goes to show that young De Plonville was not the\nconceited, meddlesome fop his acquaintances thought him. But in the\nlarge and small resolutions he did not deduct the ten per cent. for the\nunknown quantity.\n\nWhere? That was the question. De Plonville walked up and down his room,\nand thought it out. A large map of France was spread on the table.\nParis and the environs thereof were manifestly impossible. He needed a\nplace of seclusion. He needed a stretch of water. Where then should be\nthe spot to which coming generations would point and say, \"Here, at\nthis place, was perfected De Plonville's celebrated parachute-tent-\nbateau invention.\"\n\nNo, not parachute. Hang the parachute! That was the scoffing\nlieutenant's word. De Plonville paused for a moment to revile his folly\nin making a confidant of any army man.\n\nThere was a sufficiency of water around the French coast, but it was\ntoo cold at that season of the year to experiment in the north and\neast. There was left the Mediterranean. He thought rapidly of the\ndifferent delightful spots along the Riviera--Cannes, St. Raphael,\nNice, Monte Carlo,--but all of these were too public and too much\nthronged with visitors. The name of the place came to him suddenly,\nand, as he stopped his march to and fro, De Plonville wondered why it\nhad not suggested itself to him at the very first. Hy\u00e8res! It seemed to\nhave been planned in the Middle Ages for the perfecting of just such an\ninvention. It was situated two or three miles back from the sea, the\nclimate was perfect, there was no marine parade, the sea coast was\nlonely, and the bay sheltered by the islands. It was an ideal spot.\n\nDe Plonville easily secured leave of absence. Sons of fathers high up\nin the service of a grateful country seldom have any difficulty about a\nlittle thing like that. He purchased a ticket for that leisurely train\nwhich the French with their delicious sense of humor call the \"Rapide,\"\nand in due time found himself with his various belongings standing on\nthe station platform at Hy\u00e8res.\n\nFew of us are as brave as we think ourselves. De Plonville flinched\nwhen the supreme moment came, and perhaps that is why the Gods punished\nhim. He had resolved to go to one of the country inns at Carqueyranne\non the coast, but this was in a heroic mood when the lieutenant had\nlaughed at his project. Now in a cooler moment he thought of the\ncuisine of Carqueyranne and shuddered. There are sacrifices which no\nman should be called upon to endure, so the naval officer hesitated,\nand at last directed the porter to put his luggage on the top of the\nCostebelle Hotel \"bus.\" There would be society at the hotel it is true,\nbut he could avoid it, while if he went to the rural tavern he could\nnot avoid the cooking. Thus he smothered his conscience. Lunch at\nCostebelle seemed to justify his choice of an abiding-place. The\nsurroundings of the hotel were dangerously charming to a man whose\nnatural inclination was towards indolent enjoyment. It was a place to\n\"Loaf and invite your soul,\" as Walt Whitman phrases it. Plonville, who\nwas there incognito, for he had temporarily dropped the \"De,\" strolled\ntowards the sea in the afternoon, with the air of one who has nothing\non his mind. No one to see him would have suspected he was the future\nEdison of France. When he reached the coast at the ruins of the ancient\nRoman naval station called Pomponiana, he smote his thigh with joy. He\nhad forgotten that at this spot there had been erected a number of\nlittle wooden houses, each larger than a bathing-machine and smaller\nthan a cottage, which were used in summer by the good people of Hy\u00e8res,\nand in winter were silently vacant. The largest of these would be\nexactly the place for him, and he knew he would have no difficulty in\nrenting it for a month or two. Here, he could bring down his half-\nfinished invention; here, work at it all day unmolested; and here test\nits sailing qualities with no onlookers.\n\nHe walked up the road, and hailed the ancient bus which jogs along\nbetween Toulon and Hy\u00e8res by way of the coast; mounted beside the\ndriver, and speedily got information about the owner of the cottages at\nPomponiana.\n\nAs he expected, he had no difficulty in arranging with the proprietor\nfor the largest of the little cottages, but he thought he detected a\nslight depression on the right eyelid as that person handed him the\nkey. Had the owner suspected his purpose? he asked himself anxiously,\nas he drove back from the town to Costebelle. Impossible. He felt,\nhowever, that he could not be too secret about his intentions. He had\nheard of inventors being forestalled just at the very moment of\nsuccess.\n\nHe bade the driver wait, and placed that part of his luggage in the cab\nwhich consisted of his half-finished invention and the materials for\ncompleting it. Then he drove to the coast, and after placing the\npackages on the ground, paid and dismissed the man. When the cab was\nout of sight, he carried the things to the cottage and locked them in.\nHis walk up the hill to the hotel rendered the excellent dinner\nprovided doubly attractive.\n\nNext morning he was early at work, and speedily began to realize how\nmany necessary articles he had forgotten at Paris. He hoped he would be\nable to get them at Hy\u00e8res, but his remembrance of the limited\nresources of the town made him somewhat doubtful. The small windows on\neach side gave him scarcely enough light, but he did not open the door,\nfearing the curiosity of a chance passer-by. One cannot be too careful\nin maturing a great invention.\n\nPlonville had been at work for possibly an hour and a half, when he\nheard someone singing, and that very sweetly. She sang with the joyous\nfreedom of one who suspected no listener. The song came nearer and\nnearer. Plonville standing amazed, dropped his implements, and stole to\nthe somewhat obscure little window. He saw a vision of fresh loveliness\ndressed in a costume he never before beheld on a vision. She came down\nthe bank with a light, springy step to the next cottage, took a key\nthat hung at her belt, and threw open the door. The song was hushed,\nbut not silenced, for a moment, and then there came from out the\ncottage door the half of a boat that made Plonville gasp. Like the\ncostume, he had never before seen such a boat. It was exactly the shape\nin which he had designed his invention, and was of some extra light\nmaterial, for the sylph-like girl in the extraordinary dress pushed it\nforth without even ceasing her song. Next moment, she came out herself\nand stood there while she adjusted her red head-gear. She drew the boat\ndown to the water, picked out of it a light, silver-mounted paddle,\nstepped deftly aboard, and settled down to her place with the airy\ngrace of a thistle-down. There was no seat in the boat, Plonville noted\nwith astonishment. The sea was very smooth, and a few strokes of the\npaddle sent girl and craft out of sight along the coast. Plonville drew\na deep breath of bewilderment. It was his first sight of a Thames\nboating costume and a canoe.\n\nThis, then, was why the man winked when he gave him the key. Plonville\nwas in a quandary. Should he reveal himself when she returned? It did\nnot seem to be quite the thing to allow the girl to believe she had the\ncoast to herself when in fact she hadn't. But then there was his\ninvention to think of. He had sworn allegiance to that. He sat down and\npondered. English, evidently. He had no idea English girls were so\npretty, and then that costume! It was _very_ taking. The rich,\ncreamy folds of the white flannel, so simple, yet so complete, lingered\nin his memory. Still, what was he there for? His invention certainly.\nThe sneer of the lieutenant stung his memory. That Miss Whatever-her-\nname-might-be had rented the next box was nothing to him; of course\nnot. He waved her aside and turned to his work. He had lost enough of\ntime as it was; he would lose no more.\n\nAlthough armed with this heroic resolution, his task somehow did not\nseem so interesting as before, and he found himself listening now and\nthen for the siren's song. He dramatized imaginary situations, which is\nalways bad for practical work. He saw the frail craft shattered or\noverturned, and beheld himself bravely buffeting the waves rescuing the\nfair girl in white. Then he remembered with a sigh that he was not a\ngood swimmer. Possibly she was more at home in the waves than he was.\nThose English seemed on such terms of comradeship with the sea.\n\nAt last, intuition rather than hearing told him she had returned. He\nwalked on tip-toe to the dingy window. She was pulling the light canoe\nup from the water. He checked his impulse to offer assistance. When the\ngirl sprang lightly up the bank, Plonville sighed and concluded he had\ndone enough work for the day. As he reached the road, he noticed that\nthe white figure in the distance did not take the way to the hotel, but\ntowards one of the neighboring Chateaux.\n\nIn the afternoon, Plonville worked long at his invention, and made\nprogress. He walked back to his hotel with the feeling of self-\nsatisfaction which indolent men have on those rare occasions when they\nare industrious. He had been uninterrupted, and his resolutions were\nagain heroic. What had been done one afternoon might be done all\nafternoons. He would think no more of the vision he had seen and he\nwould work only after lunch, thus avoiding the necessity of revealing\nhimself, or of being a concealed watcher of her actions. Of course she\ncame always in the morning, for the English are a methodical people,\nand Plonville was so learned in their ways that he knew what they did\none day they were sure to do the next. An extraordinary nation,\nPlonville said to himself with a shrug of his shoulders, but then of\ncourse, we cannot all be French.\n\nIt is rather a pity that temptation should step in just when a man has\nmade up his mind not to deviate from a certain straight line of\nconduct. There was to be a ball that night at the big hotel. Plonville\nhad refused to have anything to do with it. He had renounced the\nfrivolities of life. He was there for rest, quiet, and study. He was\nadamant. That evening the invitation was again extended to him, the\ntruth being that there was a scarcity of young men, as is usually the\ncase at such functions. Plonville was about to re-state his objections\nto frivolity when through the open door he caught a glimpse of two of\nthe arriving guests ascending the stair. The girl had on a long opera\ncloak with some fluffy white material round the neck and down the\nfront. A filmy lace arrangement rested lightly on her fair hair. It was\nthe lady of the canoe--glorified. Plonville wavered and was lost. He\nrushed to his room and donned his war paint. Say what you like, evening\ndress improves the appearance of a man. Besides this, he had resumed\nthe De once more, and his back was naturally straighter. De Plonville\nlooked well.\n\nThey were speedily introduced, of course. De Plonville took care of\nthat, and the manager of the ball was very grateful to him for coming,\nand for looking so nice. There was actually an air of distinction about\nDe Plonville. She was the Hon. Margaret Stansby, he learned. Besides\nbeing unfair, it would be impossible to give their conversation. It\nwould read like a section from Ollendorf's French-English exercises. De\nPlonville, as has been said, was very proud of his English, and,\nunfortunately, the Hon. Margaret had a sense of humor. He complimented\nher by saying that she talked French even better than he talked\nEnglish, which, while doubtless true, was not the most tactful thing De\nPlonville might have said. It was difficult to listen to such a\nstatement given in his English, and refrain from laughing. Margaret,\nhowever, scored a great victory and did not laugh. The evening passed\npleasantly, she thought; delightfully, De Plonville thought.\n\nIt was hard after this to come down to the prosaic work of completing a\ncloth canoe-tent, but, to De Plonville's credit, he persevered. He met\nthe young lady on several occasions, but never by the coast. The better\nthey became acquainted the more he wished to have the privilege of\nrescuing her from some deadly danger; but the opportunity did not come.\nIt seldom does, except in books, as he bitterly remarked to himself.\nThe sea was exasperatingly calm, and Miss Margaret was mistress of her\ncraft, as so many charming women are. He thought of buying a telescope\nand watching her, for she had told him that one of her own delights was\nlooking at the evolutions of the ironclads through a telescope on the\nterrace in front of the Chateau.\n\nAt last, in spite of his distractions, De Plonville added the finishing\ntouches to his notable invention, and all that remained was to put it\nto a practical test. He chose a day when that portion of the French\nnavy which frequents the Rade d'Hy\u00e8res was not in sight, for he did not\nwish to come within the field of the telescope at the Chateau terrace.\nHe felt that he would not look his best as he paddled his new-fangled\nboat. Besides, it might sink with him.\n\nThere was not a sail in sight as he put forth. Even the fishing boats\nof Carqueyranne were in shelter. The sea was very calm, and the sun\nshone brightly. He had some little difficulty in getting seated, but he\nwas elated to find that his invention answered all expectations. As he\nwent further out he noticed a great buoy floating a long distance away.\nHis evil genius suggested that it would be a good thing to paddle out\nto the buoy and back. Many men can drink champagne and show no sign,\nbut few can drink success and remain sober. The eccentric airs assumed\nby noted authors prove the truth of this. De Plonville was drunk, and\nnever suspected it. The tide, what little there is of it in the\nMediterranean, helped him, and even the gentle breeze blew from the\nshore. He had some doubts as to the wisdom of his course before he\nreached the gigantic red buoy, but when he turned around and saw the\nappalling distance to the coast, he shuddered.\n\nThe great buoy was of iron, apparently boiler plate, and there were\nrings fastened to its side. It was pear-shaped with the point in the\nwater, fastened to a chain that evidently led to an anchor. He wondered\nwhat it was for. As he looked up it was moved by some unseen current,\nand rolled over as if bent on the destruction of his craft. Forgetting\nhimself, he sprang up to ward it off, and instantly one foot went\nthrough the thin waterproof that formed the bottom and sides of his\nboat. He found himself struggling in the water almost before he\nrealized what had happened. Kicking his foot free from the entanglement\nthat threatened to drag him under, he saw his invention slowly settle\ndown through the clear, green water. He grasped one of the rings of the\nbuoy, and hung there for a moment to catch his breath and consider his\nposition. He rapidly came to the conclusion that it was not a pleasant\none, but further than that he found it difficult to go. Attempting to\nswim ashore would be simply one form of suicide. The thing to do was\nevidently to get on top of the buoy, but he realized that if he tried\nto pull himself up by the rings it would simply roll him under. He was\nsurprised to find, however, that such was not the case. He had under-\nestimated both its size and its weight.\n\nHe sat down on top of it and breathed heavily after his exertions,\ngazing for a few moments at the vast expanse of shimmering blue water.\nIt was pretty, but discouraging. Not even a fishing-boat was in sight,\nand he was in a position where every prospect pleases, and only man is\nin a vile situation. The big iron island had an uncomfortable habit\nevery now and then of lounging partly over to one side or the other, so\nthat De Plonville had to scramble this way or that to keep from falling\noff. He vaguely surmised that his motions on these occasions lacked\ndignity. The hot sun began to dry the clothes on his back, and he felt\nhis hair become crisp with salt. He recollected that swimming should be\neasy here, for he was on the saltest portion of the saltest open sea in\nthe world. Then his gaze wandered over the flat lands about Les Salins\nwhere acres of ground were covered artificially with Mediterranean\nwater so that the sun may evaporate it, and leave the coarse salt used\nby the fishermen of the coast. He did not yet feel hungry, but he\nthought with regret of the good dinner which would be spread at the\nhotel that evening, when, perhaps, he would not be there.\n\nHe turned himself around and scanned the distant Islands of Gold, but\nthere was as little prospect of help from that quarter as from the\nmainland. Becoming more accustomed to the swayings of the big globe, he\nstood up. What a fool he had been to come so far, and he used French\nwords between his teeth that sounded terse and emphatic. Still there\nwas little use thinking of that. Here he was, and here he would stay,\nas a President of his country had once remarked. The irksomeness and\nrestraint of his position began to wear on his nerves, and he cried\naloud for something--anything--to happen rather than what he was\nenduring.\n\nSomething happened.\n\nFrom between the Islands, there slowly appeared a great modern French\nship of war, small in the distance. Hope lighted up the face of De\nPlonville. She must pass near enough to enable his signalling to be\nseen by the lookout. Heavens! how leisurely she moved! Then a second\nwar vessel followed the first into view, and finally a third. The three\ncame slowly along in stately procession. De Plonville removed his coat\nand waved it up and down to attract attention. So intent was he upon\nthis that he nearly lost his footing, and, realizing that the men-of-\nwar were still too far away, he desisted. He sat down as his excitement\nabated, and watched their quiet approach. Once it seemed to him they\nhad stopped, and he leaned forward, shading his eyes with his hand, and\nwatched them eagerly. They were just moving--that was all.\n\nSuddenly, from the black side of the foremost battle-ship, there rolled\nupward a cloud of white smoke, obscuring the funnels and the rigging,\nthinning out into the blue sky over the top-masts. After what seemed a\nlong interval the low, dull roar of a cannon reached him, followed by\nthe echo from the high hills of the island, and later by the fainter\nre-echo from the mountains on the mainland. This depressed De\nPlonville, for, if the ships were out for practice, the obscuring smoke\naround them would make the seeing of his signalling very improbable;\nand then that portion of the fleet might return the way it came,\nleaving him in his predicament. From the second ironclad arose a\nsimilar cloud, and this time far to his left there spurted up from the\nsea a jet of water, waving in the air like a plume for a moment, then\ndropping back in a shower on the ruffled surface.\n\nThe buoy was a target!\n\nAs De Plonville realized its use, he felt that uncomfortable creeping\nof the scalp which we call, the hair standing on end. The third cannon\nsent up its cloud, and De Plonville's eyes extended at what they saw.\nComing directly towards him was a cannon ball, skipping over the water\nlike a thrown pebble. His experience in the navy--at Paris--had never\ntaught him that such a thing was possible. He slid down flat on the\nbuoy, till his chin rested on the iron, and awaited the shock. A\nhundred yards from him the ball dipped into the water and disappeared.\nHe found that he had ineffectually tried to drive his nails into the\nboiler plate, until his fingers' ends were sore. He stood up and waved\nhis arms, but the first vessel fired again, and the ball came shrieking\nover him so low that he intuitively ducked his head. Like a pang of\nphysical pain, the thought darted through his brain that he had\ninstigated a censure on the bad firing of these very boats. Doubtless\nthey saw a man on the buoy, but as no man had any business there, the\nknocking of him off by a cannon ball would be good proof of accuracy of\naim. The investigation which followed would be a feather in the cap of\nthe officer in charge, whatever the verdict. De Plonville, with\nsomething like a sigh, more than suspected that his untimely death\nwould not cast irretrievable gloom over the fleet.\n\nWell, a man has to die but once, and there is little use in making a\nfuss over the inevitable. He would meet his fate calmly and as a\nFrenchman should, with his face to the guns. There was a tinge of\nregret that there would be no one to witness his heroism. It is always\npleasant on such occasions to have a war correspondent, or at least a\nreporter, present. It is best to be as comfortable as possible under\nany circumstances, so De Plonville sat down on the spheroid and let his\nfeet dangle toward the water. The great buoy for some reason floated\naround until it presented its side to the ships. None of the balls came\nso near as those first fired--perhaps because of the accumulated smoke.\nNew features of the situation continued to present themselves to De\nPlonville as he sat there. The firing had been going on for some time\nbefore he reflected that if a shot punctured the buoy it would fill and\nsink. Perhaps their orders were to fire until the buoy disappeared.\nThere was little comfort in this suggestion.\n\nFiring had ceased for some minutes before he noticed the fact. A bank\nof thinning smoke rested on the water between the buoy and the ships.\nHe saw the ironclads move ponderously around and steam through this\nbank turning broadside on again in one, two, three, order. He watched\nthe evolution with his chin resting on his hands, not realizing that\nthe moment for signalling had come. When the idea penetrated his\nsomewhat dazed mind, he sprang to his feet, but his opportunity had\ngone. The smoke of the first gun rose in the air, there was a clang of\niron on iron, and De Plonville found himself whirling in space: then\nsinking in the sea. Coming breathless to the surface, he saw the buoy\nrevolving slowly, and a deep dinge in its side seemed to slide over its\ntop and disappear into the water, showing where the shot had struck.\nThe second boat did not fire, and he knew that they were examining the\nbuoy with their glasses. He swam around to the other side, intending to\ncatch a ring and have it haul him up where he could be seen. Before he\nreached the place the buoy was at rest again, and as he laboriously\nclimbed on top more dead than alive, the second ship opened fire. He\nlay down at full length exhausted, and hoped if they were going to hit\nthey would hit quick. Life was not worth having on these conditions. He\nfelt the hot sun on his back, and listened dreamily to the cannon. Hope\nwas gone, and he wondered at himself for feeling a remote rather than\nan active interest in his fate. He thought of himself as somebody else,\nand felt a vague impersonal pity. He criticised the random firing, and\nsuspected the hit was merely a fluke. When his back was dry he rolled\nlazily over and lay gazing up at the cloudless sky. For greater comfort\nhe placed his hands beneath his head. The sky faded, and a moment's\nunconsciousness intervened.\n\n\"This won't do,\" he cried, shaking himself. \"If I fall asleep I shall\nroll off.\"\n\nHe sat up again, his joints stiff with his immersion, and watched the\ndistant ironclads. He saw with languid interest a ball strike the\nwater, take a new flight, and plunge into the sea far to the right. He\nthought that the vagaries of cannon-balls at sea would make an\ninteresting study.\n\n\"Are you injured?\" cried a clear voice behind him.\n\n\"_Mon Dieu!_\" shouted the young man in a genuine fright, as he\nsprang to his feet.\n\n\"Oh, I beg pardon,\" as if a rescuer need apologize, \"I thought you were\nM. De Plonville.\"\n\n\"I _am_ De Plonville.\"\n\n\"Your hair is grey,\" she said in an awed whisper; then added, \"and no\nwonder.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" replied the stricken young man, placing his hand on his\nheart, \"it is needless to deny--I do not deny--that I was frightened--\nbut--I did not think--not so much as that, I regret. It is so--so--\ntheatrical--I am deeply sorrowful.\"\n\n\"Please say no more, but come quickly. Can you come down? Step exactly\nin the middle of the canoe. Be careful--it is easily upset--and sit\ndown at once. That was very nicely done.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle, allow me at least to row the boat.\"\n\n\"It is paddling, and you do not understand it. I do. Please do not\nspeak until we are out of range. I am horribly frightened.\"\n\n\"You are very, very brave.\"\n\n\"Hs--s--sh.\"\n\nMiss Stansby wielded the double-bladed paddle in a way a Red Indian\nmight have envied. Once she uttered a little feminine shriek as a\ncannon ball plunged into the water behind them; but as they got further\naway from the buoy those on the iron-clads appeared to notice that a\nboat was within range, and the firing ceased.\n\nMiss Stansby looked fixedly at the solemn young man sitting before her;\nthen placed her paddle across the canoe, bent over it, and laughed. De\nPlonville saw the reaction had come. He said sympathetically:--\n\n\"Ah, Mademoiselle, do not, I beg. All danger is over, I think.\"\n\n\"I am not frightened, don't think it,\" she cried, flashing a look of\ndefiance at him, and forgetting her admission of fear a moment before.\n\"My father was an Admiral. I am laughing at my mistake. It is salt.\"\n\n\"What is?\" asked her astonished passenger.\n\n\"In your hair.\"\n\nHe ran his fingers through his hair, and the salt rattled down to the\nbottom of the canoe. There was something of relief in _his_ laugh.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nDe Plonville always believes the officers on board the gunboats\nrecognized him. When it was known in Paris that he was to be married to\nthe daughter of an English Admiral, whom rumor said he had bravely\nsaved from imminent peril, the army lieutenant remarked that she could\nnever have heard him speak her language--which, as we know, is not\ntrue.\n\n\n\n\nA NEW EXPLOSIVE.\n\n\nThe French Minister of War sat in his very comfortable chair in his own\nprivate yet official room, and pondered over a letter he had received.\nBeing Minister of War, he was naturally the most mild, the most humane,\nand least quarrelsome man in the Cabinet. A Minister of War receives\nmany letters that, as a matter of course, he throws into his waste\nbasket, but this particular communication had somehow managed to rivet\nhis attention. When a man becomes Minister of War he learns for the\nfirst time that apparently the great majority of mankind are engaged in\nthe manufacture or invention of rifles, gunpowders, and devices of all\nkinds for the destruction of the rest of the world.\n\nThat morning, the Minister of War had received a letter which announced\nto him that the writer of it had invented an explosive so terrible that\nall known destructive agencies paled before it. As a Frenchman, he made\nthe first offer of his discovery to the French Government. It would\ncost the Minister nothing, he said, to make a test which would\ncorroborate his amazing claims for the substance, and the moment that\ntest was made, any intelligent man would recognize the fact that the\ncountry which possessed the secret of this destructive compound would\nat once occupy an unassailable position in a contentious world.\n\nThe writer offered personally to convince the Minister of the truth of\nhis assertions, provided they could go to some remote spot where the\nresults of the explosion would do no damage, and where they would be\nsafe from espionage. The writer went on very frankly to say that if the\nMinister consulted with the agents of the police, they would at once\nsee in this invitation a trap for the probable assassination of the\nMinister. But the inventor claimed that the Minister's own good sense\nshould show him that his death was desired by none. He was but newly\nappointed, and had not yet had time to make enemies. France was at\npeace with all the world, and this happened before the time of the\nAnarchist demonstrations in Paris. It was but right, the letter went\non, that the Minister should have some guarantee as to the _bona\nfides_ of the inventor. He therefore gave his name and address, and\nsaid if the Minister made inquiries from the police, he would find\nnothing stood in their books against him. He was a student, whose\nattention, for years, had been given to the subject of explosives. To\nfurther show that he was entirely unselfish in this matter, he added\nthat he had no desire to enrich himself by his discovery. He had a\nprivate income quite sufficient for his needs, and he intended to give,\nand not to sell, his secret to France. The only proviso he made was\nthat his name should be linked with this terrible compound, which he\nmaintained would secure universal peace to the world, for, after its\nqualities were known, no nation would dare to fight with another. The\nsole ambition of the inventor, said the letter in conclusion, was to\nplace his name high in the list of celebrated French scientists. If,\nhowever, the Minister refused to treat with him he would go to other\nGovernments until his invention was taken up, but the Government which\nsecured it would at once occupy the leading position among nations. He\nentreated the Minister, therefore, for the sake of his country, to make\nat least one test of the compound.\n\nIt was, as I have said, before the time of the Paris explosions, and\nministers were not so suspicious then as they are now. The Minister\nmade inquiries regarding the scientist, who lived in a little suburb of\nParis, and found that there was nothing against him on the books of the\npolice. Inquiry showed that all he had said about his own private\nfortune was true. The Minister therefore wrote to the inventor, and\nnamed an hour at which he would receive him in his private office.\n\nThe hour and the man arrived together. The Minister had had some slight\ndoubts regarding his sanity, but the letter had been so\nstraightforwardly written, and the appearance of the man himself was so\nkindly and benevolent and intelligent that the doubts of the official\nvanished.\n\n\"I beg you to be seated,\" said the Minister. \"We are entirely alone,\nand nothing you say will be heard by any one but myself.\"\n\n\"I thank you, Monsieur le Ministre,\" replied the inventor, \"for this\nmark of confidence; for I am afraid the claims I made in the letter\nwere so extraordinary that you might well have hesitated about granting\nme an interview.\"\n\nThe Minister smiled. \"I understand,\" he said, \"the enthusiasm of an\ninventor for his latest triumph, and I was enabled thus to take, as it\nwere, some discount from your statements, although I doubt not that you\nhave discovered something that may be of benefit to the War\nDepartment.\"\n\nThe inventor hesitated, looking seriously at the great official before\nhim.\n\n\"From what you say,\" he began at last, \"I am rather afraid that my\nletter misled you, for, fearing it would not be credited I was obliged\nto make my claims so mild that I erred in under-estimating rather than\nin over-stating them. I have the explosive here in my pocket.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried the Minister, a shade of pallor coming over his\ncountenance, as he pushed back his chair. \"I thought I stated in my\nnote that you were not to bring it.\"\n\n\"Forgive me for not obeying. It is perfectly harmless while in this\nstate. This is one of the peculiarities--a beneficent peculiarity if I\nmay so term it--of this terrible agent. It may be handled with perfect\nsafety, and yet its effects are as inevitable as death,\" saying which,\nhe took out of his pocket and held up to the light a bottle filled with\na clear colorless liquid like water.\n\n\"You could pour that on the fire,\" he said, \"with no other effect than\nto put out the blaze. You might place it under a steam hammer and crush\nthe bottle to powder, yet no explosion would follow. It is as harmless\nas water in its present condition.\"\n\n\"How, then,\" said the Minister, \"do you deal with it?\"\n\nAgain the man hesitated.\n\n\"I am almost afraid to tell you,\" he said; \"and if I could not\ndemonstrate to your entire satisfaction that what I say is true, it\nwould be folly for me to say what I am about to say. If I were to take\nthis bottle and cut a notch in the cork, and walk with it neck\ndownwards along the Boulevard des Italiens, allowing this fluid to fall\ndrop by drop on the pavement, I could walk in that way in safety\nthrough every street in Paris. If it rained that day nothing would\nhappen. If it rained the next or for a week nothing would happen, but\nthe moment the sun came out and dried the moisture, the light step of a\ncat on any pavement over which I had passed would instantly shatter to\nruins the whole of Paris.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" cried the Minister, an expression of horror coming into\nhis face.\n\n\"I knew you would say that. Therefore I ask you to come with me to the\ncountry, where I can prove the truth of what I allege. While I carry\nthis bottle around with me in this apparently careless fashion, it is\ncorked, as you see with the utmost security. Not a drop of the fluid\nmust be left on the outside of the cork or of the bottle. I have wiped\nthe bottle and cork most thoroughly, and burned the cloth which I used\nin doing so. Fire will not cause this compound, even when dry, to\nexplode, but the slightest touch will set it off. I have to be\nextremely careful in its manufacture, so that not a single drop is left\nunaccounted for in any place where it might evaporate.\"\n\nThe Minister, with his finger-tips together and his eyes on the\nceiling, mused for a few moments on the amazing statement he had heard.\n\n\"If what you say is true,\" he began at last, \"don't you think it would\nbe more humane to destroy all traces of the experiments by which you\ndiscovered this substance, and to divulge the secret to no one? The\ndevastation such a thing would cause, if it fell into unscrupulous\nhands, is too appalling even to contemplate.\"\n\n\"I have thought of that,\" said the inventor; \"but some one else--the\ntime may be far off or it may be near--is bound to make the discovery.\nMy whole ambition, as I told you in my letter, is to have my name\ncoupled with this discovery. I wish it to be known as the Lambelle\nExplosive. The secret would be safe with the French Government.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" returned the Minister. \"Some unscrupulous\nman may become Minister of War, and may use his knowledge to put\nhimself in the position of Dictator. An unscrupulous man in the\npossession of such a secret would be invincible.\"\n\n\"What you say,\" replied the inventor, \"is undoubtedly true; yet I am\ndetermined that the name of Lambelle shall go down in history coupled\nwith the most destructive agent the world has ever known, or will know.\nIf the Government of France will build for me a large stone structure\nas secure as a fortress, I will keep my secret, but will fill that\nbuilding with bottles like this, and then----\"\n\n\"I do not see,\" said the Minister, \"that that would lessen the danger,\nif the unscrupulous man I speak of once became possessed of the keys;\nand, besides, the mere fact that such a secret existed would put other\ninventors upon the track, and some one else less benevolent than\nyourself would undoubtedly make the discovery. You admitted a moment\nago that the chances were a future investigator would succeed in\ngetting the right ingredients together, even without the knowledge that\nsuch an explosive existed. See what an incentive it would be to\ninventors all over the world, if it were known that France had in its\npossession such a fearful explosive! No Government has ever yet been\nsuccessful in keeping the secret of either a gun or a gunpowder.\"\n\n\"There is, of course,\" said Lambelle, \"much in what you say; but,\nequally of course, all that you say might have been said to the\ninventor of gunpowder, for gunpowder in its day was as wonderful as\nthis is now.\"\n\nSuddenly the Minister laughed aloud.\n\n\"I am talking seriously with you on this subject,\" he exclaimed, \"as if\nI really believed in it. Of course, I may say I do nothing of the kind.\nI think you must have hypnotized me with those calm eyes of yours into\ncrediting your statements for even a few moments.\"\n\n\"All that I say,\" said the inventor quietly, \"can be corroborated to-\nmorrow. Make an appointment with me in the country, and if it chances\nto be a calm and sunny day you will no longer doubt the evidence of\nyour own eyes.\"\n\n\"Where do you wish the experiment to be made?\" asked the Minister.\n\n\"It must be in some wild and desolate region, on a hill-top for\npreference. There should be either trees or old buildings there that we\ncan destroy, otherwise the full effects can hardly be estimated.\"\n\n\"I have a place in the country,\" said the Minister, \"which is wild and\ndesolate and unprofitable enough. There are some useless stone\nbuildings, not on a hill-top, but by the edge of a quarry which has\nbeen unworked for many years. There is no habitation for several miles\naround. Would such a spot be suitable?\"\n\n\"Perfectly so. When would it be convenient for you to go?\"\n\n\"I will leave with you to-night,\" said the Minister, \"and we can spend\nthe day to-morrow experimenting.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" answered Lambelle, rising when the Minister had told him\nthe hour and the railway station at which they should meet.\n\nThat evening, when the Minister drove to the railway station in time\nfor his train, he found Lambelle waiting for him, holding, by a leash,\ntwo sorry-looking dogs.\n\n\"Do you travel with such animals as these?\" asked the Minister.\n\n\"The poor brutes,\" said Lambelle, with regret in his voice, \"are\nnecessary for our experiments. They will be in atoms by this time to-\nmorrow.\"\n\nThe dogs were put into the railway-van, and the inventor brought his\nportmanteau with him into the private carriage reserved for the use of\nthe Minister.\n\nThe place, as the Minister of War had said, was desolate enough. The\nstone buildings near the edge of the deserted quarry were stout and\nstrong, although partly in ruins.\n\n\"I have here with me in my portmanteau,\" said Lambelle, \"some hundreds\nof metres of electric wire. I will attach one of the dogs by this clip,\nwhich we can release from a distance by pressing an electric button.\nThe moment the dog escapes he will undoubtedly explode the compound.\"\n\nThe insulated wire was run along the ground to a distant elevation. The\ndog was attached by the electric clip, and chained to a doorpost of one\nof the buildings. Lambelle then carefully uncorked his bottle, holding\nit at arm's length from his person. The Minister looked on with strange\ninterest as Lambelle allowed the fluid to drip in a semicircular line\naround the chained dog. The inventor carefully re-corked the bottle,\nwiped it thoroughly with a cloth he had with him, and threw the cloth\ninto one of the deserted houses.\n\nThey waited near, until the spots caused by the fluid on the stone\npavement in front of the house had disappeared.\n\n\"By the time we reach the hill,\" said Lambelle, \"it will be quite dry\nin this hot sun.\"\n\nAs they departed towards the elevation, the forlorn dog howled\nmournfully, as if in premonition of his fate.\n\n\"I think, to make sure,\" said the inventor, when they reached the\nelectrical apparatus, \"that we might wait for half an hour.\"\n\nThe Minister lit a cigarette, and smoked silently, a strange battle\ngoing on in his mind. He found himself believing in the extraordinary\nclaims made by the inventor, and his thought dwelt on the awful\npossibilities of such an explosive.\n\n\"Will you press the electric lever?\" asked Lambelle quietly. \"Remember\nthat you are inaugurating a new era.\"\n\nThe Minister pressed down the key, and then, putting his field-glass to\nhis eye, he saw that the dog was released, but the animal sat there\nscratching its ear with its paw. Then, realizing that it was loose, it\nsniffed for a moment at the chain. Finally, it threw up its head and\nbarked, although the distance was too great for them to hear any sound.\nThe dog started in the direction the two men had gone, but, before it\nhad taken three steps, the Minister was appalled to see the buildings\nsuddenly crumble into dust, and a few moments later the thunder of the\nrocks falling into the deserted quarry came toward them. The whole\nledge had been flung forwards into the chasm. There was no smoke, but a\nhaze of dust hovered over the spot.\n\n\"My God!\" cried the Minister. \"That is awful!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lambelle quietly; \"I put more of the substance on the\nflagging than I need to have done. A few drops would have answered\nquite as well, but I wanted to make sure. You were very sceptical, you\nknow.\"\n\nThe Minister looked at him. \"I beg of you, M. Lambelle, never to\ndivulge this secret to the Government of France, or to any other power.\nTake the risk of it being discovered in the future. I implore you to\nreconsider your original intention. If you desire money, I will see\nthat you get what you want from the secret funds.\"\n\nLambelle shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I have no desire for money,\" he said; \"but what you have seen will\nshow you that I shall be the most famous scientist of the century. The\nname of Lambelle will be known till the end of the world.\"\n\n\"But, my God, man!\" said the Minister, \"the end of the world is here\nthe moment your secret is in the possession of another. With you or me\nit would be safe: but who can tell the minds of those who may follow\nus? You are putting the power of the Almighty into the hands of a man.\"\n\nLambelle flushed with pride as the pale-faced Minister said this.\n\n\"You speak the truth!\" he cried, \"it is the power of Omnipotence.\"\n\n\"Then,\" implored the Minister, \"reconsider your decision.\"\n\n\"I have labored too long,\" said Lambelle, \"to forego my triumph now.\nYou are convinced at last, I see. Now then, tell me: will you, as\nMinister of France, secure for your country this greatest of all\ninventions?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the Minister; \"no other power must be allowed to obtain\nthe secret. Have you ever written down the names of the ingredients?\"\n\n\"Never,\" answered Lambelle.\n\n\"Is it not possible for any one to have suspected what your experiments\nwere? If a man got into your laboratory--a scientific man--could he\nnot, from what he saw there, obtain the secret?\"\n\n\"It would be impossible,\" said Lambelle. \"I have been too anxious to\nkeep the credit for myself, to leave any traces that might give a hint\nof what I was doing.\"\n\n\"You were wise in that,\" said the Minister, drawing a deep breath. \"Now\nlet us go and look at the ruins.\"\n\nAs they neared the spot the official's astonishment at the\nextraordinary destruction became greater and greater. The rock had been\nrent as if by an earthquake, to the distance of hundreds of yards.\n\n\"You say,\" said the Minister, \"that the liquid is perfectly safe until\nevaporation takes place.\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" answered Lambelle. \"Of course one has to be careful, as I\ntold you, in the use of it. You must not get a drop on your clothes, or\nleave it anywhere on the outside of the bottle to evaporate.\"\n\n\"Let me see the stuff.\"\n\nLambelle handed him the bottle.\n\n\"Have you any more of this in your laboratory?\"\n\n\"Not a drop.\"\n\n\"If you wished to destroy this, how would you do it?\"\n\n\"I should empty the bottle into the Seine. It would flow down to the\nsea, and no harm would be done.\"\n\n\"See if you can find any traces of the dog,\" said the Minister. \"I will\nclamber down into the quarry, and look there.\"\n\n\"You will find nothing,\" said Lambelle confidently.\n\nThere was but one path by which the bottom of the quarry could be\nreached. The Minister descended by this until he was out of sight of\nthe man above; then he quickly uncorked the bottle, and allowed the\nfluid to drip along the narrowest part of the path which faced the\nburning sun. He corked the bottle, wiped it carefully with his\nhandkerchief, which he rolled into a ball, and threw into the quarry.\nComing up to the surface again, he said to the mild and benevolent\nscientist: \"I cannot find a trace of the dog.\"\n\n\"Nor can I,\" said Lambelle. \"Of course when you can hardly find a sign\nof the building it is not to be expected that there should be any\nremnants of the dog.\"\n\n\"Suppose we get back to the hill now and have lunch,\" said the\nMinister.\n\n\"Do you wish to try another experiment?\"\n\n\"I would like to try one more after we have had something to eat. What\nwould be the effect if you poured the whole bottleful into the quarry\nand set it off?\"\n\n\"Oh, impossible!\" cried Lambelle. \"It would rend this whole part of the\ncountry to pieces. In fact, I am not sure that the shock would not be\nfelt as far as Paris. With a very few drops I can shatter the whole\nquarry.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll try that after lunch. We have another dog left.\"\n\nWhen an hour had passed, Lambelle was anxious to try his quarry\nexperiment.\n\n\"By-and-by,\" he said, \"the sun will not be shining in the quarry, and\nthen it will be too late.\"\n\n\"We can easily wait until to-morrow, unless you are in a hurry.\"\n\n\"I am in no hurry,\" rejoined the inventor. \"I thought perhaps you might\nbe, with so much to do.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the official. \"Nothing I shall do during my\nadministration will be more important than this.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear you say so,\" answered Lambelle; \"and if you will\ngive me the bottle again I will now place a few drops in the sunny part\nof the quarry.\"\n\nThe Minister handed him the bottle, apparently with some reluctance.\n\n\"I still think,\" he said, \"that it would be much better to allow this\nsecret to die. No one knows it at present but yourself. With you, as I\nhave said, it will be safe, or with me; but think of the awful\npossibilities of a disclosure.\"\n\n\"Every great invention has its risks,\" said Lambelle firmly. \"Nothing\nwould induce me to forego the fruits of my life-work. It is too much to\nask of any man.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the Minister. \"Then let us be sure of our facts. I\nwant to see the effects of the explosive on the quarry.\"\n\n\"You shall,\" said Lambelle, as he departed.\n\n\"I will wait for you here,\" said the Minister, \"and smoke a cigarette.\"\n\nWhen the inventor approached the quarry, leading the dog behind him,\nthe Minister's hand trembled so that he was hardly able to hold the\nfield-glass to his eye. Lambelle disappeared down the path. The next\ninstant the ground trembled even where the Minister sat, and a haze of\ndust arose above the ruined quarry.\n\nSome moments after the pallid Minister looked over the work of\ndestruction, but no trace of humanity was there except himself.\n\n\"I could not do otherwise,\" he murmured, \"It was too great a risk to\nrun.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE GREAT PEGRAM MYSTERY.\n\n\n(_With apologies to Dr. Conan Doyle, and our mutual and lamented\nfriend the late Sherlock Holmes_.)\n\nI dropped in on my friend, Sherlaw Kombs, to hear what he had to say\nabout the Pegram mystery, as it had come to be called in the\nnewspapers. I found him playing the violin with a look of sweet peace\nand serenity on his face, which I never noticed on the countenances of\nthose within hearing distance. I knew this expression of seraphic calm\nindicated that Kombs had been deeply annoyed about something. Such,\nindeed, proved to be the case, for one of the morning papers had\ncontained an article, eulogizing the alertness and general competence\nof Scotland Yard. So great was Sherlaw Kombs's contempt for Scotland\nYard that he never would visit Scotland during his vacations, nor would\nhe ever admit that a Scotchman was fit for anything but export.\n\nHe generously put away his violin, for he had a sincere liking for me,\nand greeted me with his usual kindness.\n\n\"I have come,\" I began, plunging at once into the matter on my mind,\n\"to hear what you think of the great Pegram mystery.\"\n\n\"I haven't heard of it,\" he said quietly, just as if all London were\nnot talking of that very thing. Kombs was curiously ignorant on some\nsubjects, and abnormally learned on others. I found, for instance, that\npolitical discussion with him was impossible, because he did not know\nwho Salisbury and Gladstone were. This made his friendship a great\nboon.\n\n\"The Pegram mystery has baffled even Gregory, of Scotland Yard.\"\n\n\"I can well believe it,\" said my friend, calmly. \"Perpetual motion, or\nsquaring the circle, would baffle Gregory. He's an infant, is Gregory.\"\n\nThis was one of the things I always liked about Kombs. There was no\nprofessional jealousy in him, such as characterizes so many other men.\n\nHe filled his pipe, threw himself into his deep-seated arm-chair,\nplaced his feet on the mantel, and clasped his hands behind his head.\n\n\"Tell me about it,\" he said simply.\n\n\"Old Barrie Kipson,\" I began, \"was a stockbroker in the City. He lived\nin Pegram, and it was his custom to----\"\n\n\"COME IN!\" shouted Kombs, without changing his position, but with a\nsuddenness that startled me. I had heard no knock.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said my friend, laughing, \"my invitation to enter was a\ntrifle premature. I was really so interested in your recital that I\nspoke before I thought, which a detective should never do. The fact is,\na man will be here in a moment who will tell me all about this crime,\nand so you will be spared further effort in that line.\"\n\n\"Ah, you have an appointment. In that case I will not intrude,\" I said,\nrising.\n\n\"Sit down; I have no appointment. I did not know until I spoke that he\nwas coming.\"\n\nI gazed at him in amazement. Accustomed as I was to his extraordinary\ntalents, the man was a perpetual surprise to me. He continued to smoke\nquietly, but evidently enjoyed my consternation.\n\n\"I see you are surprised. It is really too simple to talk about, but,\nfrom my position opposite the mirror, I can see the reflection of\nobjects in the street. A man stopped, looked at one of my cards, and\nthen glanced across the street. I recognized my card, because, as you\nknow, they are all in scarlet. If, as you say, London is talking of\nthis mystery, it naturally follows that _he_ will talk of it, and\nthe chances are he wished to consult me about it. Anyone can see that,\nbesides there is always--_Come_ in!\"\n\nThere was a rap at the door this time.\n\nA stranger entered. Sherlaw Kombs did not change his lounging attitude.\n\n\"I wish to see Mr. Sherlaw Kombs, the detective,\" said the stranger,\ncoming within the range of the smoker's vision.\n\n\"This is Mr. Kombs,\" I remarked at last, as my friend smoked quietly,\nand seemed half-asleep.\n\n\"Allow me to introduce myself,\" continued the stranger, fumbling for a\ncard.\n\n\"There is no need. You are a journalist,\" said Kombs.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the stranger, somewhat taken aback, \"you know me, then.\"\n\n\"Never saw or heard of you in my life before.\"\n\n\"Then how in the world----\"\n\n\"Nothing simpler. You write for an evening paper. You have written an\narticle slating the book of a friend. He will feel badly about it, and\nyou will condole with him. He will never know who stabbed him unless I\ntell him.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" cried the journalist, sinking into a chair and mopping his\nbrow, while his face became livid.\n\n\"Yes,\" drawled Kombs, \"it is a devil of a shame that such things are\ndone. But what would you? as we say in France.\"\n\nWhen the journalist had recovered his second wind he pulled himself\ntogether somewhat. \"Would you object to telling me how you know these\nparticulars about a man you say you have never seen?\"\n\n\"I rarely talk about these things,\" said Kombs with great composure.\n\"But as the cultivation of the habit of observation may help you in\nyour profession, and thus in a remote degree benefit me by making your\npaper less deadly dull, I will tell you. Your first and second fingers\nare smeared with ink, which shows that you write a great deal. This\nsmeared class embraces two sub-classes, clerks or accountants, and\njournalists. Clerks have to be neat in their work. The ink-smear is\nslight in their case. Your fingers are badly and carelessly smeared;\ntherefore, you are a journalist. You have an evening paper in your\npocket. Anyone might have any evening paper, but yours is a Special\nEdition, which will not be on the streets for half-an-hour yet. You\nmust have obtained it before you left the office, and to do this you\nmust be on the staff. A book notice is marked with a blue pencil. A\njournalist always despises every article in his own paper not written\nby himself; therefore, you wrote the article you have marked, and\ndoubtless are about to send it to the author of the book referred to.\nYour paper makes a specialty of abusing all books not written by some\nmember of its own staff. That the author is a friend of yours, I merely\nsurmised. It is all a trivial example of ordinary observation.\"\n\n\"Really, Mr. Kombs, you are the most wonderful man on earth. You are\nthe equal of Gregory, by Jove, you are.\"\n\nA frown marred the brow of my friend as he placed his pipe on the\nsideboard and drew his self-cocking six-shooter.\n\n\"Do you mean to insult me, sir?\"\n\n\"I do not--I--I assure you. You are fit to take charge of Scotland Yard\nto-morrow----. I am in earnest, indeed I am, sir.\"\n\n\"Then Heaven help you,\" cried Kombs, slowly raising his right arm.\n\nI sprang between them.\n\n\"Don't shoot!\" I cried. \"You will spoil the carpet. Besides, Sherlaw,\ndon't you see the man means well. He actually thinks it is a\ncompliment!\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are right,\" remarked the detective, flinging his revolver\ncarelessly beside his pipe, much to the relief of the third party.\nThen, turning to the journalist, he said, with his customary bland\ncourtesy--\n\n\"You wanted to see me, I think you said. What can I do for you, Mr.\nWilber Scribbings?\"\n\nThe journalist started.\n\n\"How do you know my name?\" he gasped.\n\nKombs waved his hand impatiently.\n\n\"Look inside your hat if you doubt your own name?\"\n\nI then noticed for the first time that the name was plainly to be seen\ninside the top-hat Scribbings held upside down in his hands.\n\n\"You have heard, of course, of the Pegram mystery----\".\n\n\"Tush,\" cried the detective; \"do not, I beg of you, call it a mystery.\nThere is no such thing. Life would become more tolerable if there ever\n_was_ a mystery. Nothing is original. Everything has been done\nbefore. What about the Pegram affair?\"\n\n\"The Pegram--ah--case has baffled everyone. The _Evening Blade_\nwishes you to investigate, so that it may publish the result. It will\npay you well. Will you accept the commission?\"\n\n\"Possibly. Tell me about the case.\"\n\n\"I thought everybody knew the particulars. Mr. Barrie Kipson lived at\nPegram. He carried a first-class season ticket between the terminus and\nthat station. It was his custom to leave for Pegram on the 5.30 train\neach evening. Some weeks ago, Mr. Kipson was brought down by the\ninfluenza. On his first visit to the City after his recovery, he drew\nsomething like \u00a3300 in notes, and left the office at his usual hour to\ncatch the 5.30. He was never seen again alive, as far as the public\nhave been able to learn. He was found at Brewster in a first-class\ncompartment on the Scotch Express, which does not stop between London\nand Brewster. There was a bullet in his head, and his money was gone,\npointing plainly to murder and robbery.\"\n\n\"And where is the mystery, may I ask?\"\n\n\"There are several unexplainable things about the case. First, how came\nhe on the Scotch Express, which leaves at six, and does not stop at\nPegram? Second, the ticket examiners at the terminus would have turned\nhim out if he showed his season ticket; and all the tickets sold for\nthe Scotch Express on the 21st are accounted for. Third, how could the\nmurderer have escaped? Fourth, the passengers in the two compartments\non each side of the one where the body was found heard no scuffle and\nno shot fired.\"\n\n\"Are you sure the Scotch Express on the 21st did not stop between\nLondon and Brewster?\"\n\n\"Now that you mention the fact, it did. It was stopped by signal just\noutside of Pegram. There was a few moments' pause, when the line was\nreported clear, and it went on again. This frequently happens, as there\nis a branch line beyond Pegram.\"\n\nMr. Sherlaw Kombs pondered for a few moments, smoking his pipe\nsilently.\n\n\"I presume you wish the solution in time for to-morrow's paper?\"\n\n\"Bless my soul, no. The editor thought if you evolved a theory in a\nmonth you would do well.\"\n\n\"My dear sir, I do not deal with theories, but with facts. If you can\nmake it convenient to call here to-morrow at 8 a.m. I will give you the\nfull particulars early enough for the first edition. There is no sense\nin taking up much time over so simple an affair as the Pegram case.\nGood afternoon, sir.\"\n\nMr. Scribbings was too much astonished to return the greeting. He left\nin a speechless condition, and I saw him go up the street with his hat\nstill in his hand.\n\nSherlaw Kombs relapsed into his old lounging attitude, with his hands\nclasped behind his head. The smoke came from his lips in quick puffs at\nfirst, then at longer intervals. I saw he was coming to a conclusion,\nso I said nothing.\n\nFinally he spoke in his most dreamy manner. \"I do not wish to seem to\nbe rushing things at all, Whatson, but I am going out to-night on the\nScotch Express. Would you care to accompany me?\"\n\n\"Bless me!\" I cried, glancing at the clock, \"you haven't time, it is\nafter five now.\"\n\n\"Ample time, Whatson--ample,\" he murmured, without changing his\nposition. \"I give myself a minute and a half to change slippers and\ndressing gown for boots and coat, three seconds for hat, twenty-five\nseconds to the street, forty-two seconds waiting for a hansom, and then\nseven at the terminus before the express starts. I shall be glad of\nyour company.\"\n\nI was only too happy to have the privilege of going with him. It was\nmost interesting to watch the workings of so inscrutable a mind. As we\ndrove under the lofty iron roof of the terminus I noticed a look of\nannoyance pass over his face.\n\n\"We are fifteen seconds ahead of our time,\" he remarked, looking at the\nbig clock. \"I dislike having a miscalculation of that sort occur.\"\n\nThe great Scotch Express stood ready for its long journey. The\ndetective tapped one of the guards on the shoulder.\n\n\"You have heard of the so-called Pegram mystery, I presume?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir. It happened on this very train, sir.\"\n\n\"Really? Is the same carriage still on the train?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, sir, it is,\" replied the guard, lowering his voice, \"but of\ncourse, sir, we have to keep very quiet about it. People wouldn't\ntravel in it, else, sir.\"\n\n\"Doubtless. Do you happen to know if anybody occupies the compartment\nin which the body was found?\"\n\n\"A lady and gentleman, sir; I put 'em in myself, sir.\"\n\n\"Would you further oblige me,\" said the detective, deftly slipping\nhalf-a-sovereign into the hand of the guard, \"by going to the window\nand informing them in an offhand casual sort of way that the tragedy\ntook place in that compartment?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir.\"\n\nWe followed the guard, and the moment he had imparted his news there\nwas a suppressed scream in the carriage. Instantly a lady came out,\nfollowed by a florid-faced gentleman, who scowled at the guard. We\nentered the now empty compartment, and Kombs said: \"We would like to be\nalone here until we reach Brewster.\"\n\n\"I'll see to that, sir,\" answered the guard, locking the door.\n\nWhen the official moved away, I asked my friend what he expected to\nfind in the carriage that would cast any light on the case.\n\n\"Nothing,\" was his brief reply.\n\n\"Then why do you come?\"\n\n\"Merely to corroborate the conclusions I have already arrived at.\"\n\n\"And may I ask what those conclusions are?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied the detective, with a touch of lassitude in his\nvoice. \"I beg to call your attention, first, to the fact that this\ntrain stands between two platforms, and can be entered from either\nside. Any man familiar with the station for years would be aware of\nthat fact. This shows how Mr. Kipson entered the train just before it\nstarted.\"\n\n\"But the door on this side is locked,\" I objected, trying it.\n\n\"Of course. But every season ticket-holder carries a key. This accounts\nfor the guard not seeing him, and for the absence of a ticket. Now let\nme give you some information about the influenza. The patient's\ntemperature rises several degrees above normal, and he has a fever.\nWhen the malady has run its course, the temperature falls to three-\nquarters of a degree below normal. These, facts are unknown to you, I\nimagine, because you are a doctor.\"\n\nI admitted such was the case.\n\n\"Well, the consequence of this fall in temperature is that the\nconvalescent's mind turns toward thoughts of suicide. Then is the time\nhe should be watched by his friends. Then was the time Mr. Barrie\nKipson's friends did _not_ watch him. You remember the 21st, of\ncourse. No? It was a most depressing day. Fog all around and mud under\nfoot. Very good. He resolves on suicide. He wishes to be unidentified,\nif possible but forgets his season ticket. My experience is that a man\nabout to commit a crime always forgets something.\"\n\n\"But how do you account for the disappearance of the money?\"\n\n\"The money has nothing to do with the matter. If he was a deep man, and\nknew the stupidness of Scotland Yard, he probably sent the notes to an\nenemy. If not, they may have been given to a friend. Nothing is more\ncalculated to prepare the mind for self-destruction than the prospect\nof a night ride on the Scotch Express, and the view from the windows of\nthe train as it passes through the northern part of London is\nparticularly conducive to thoughts of annihilation.\"\n\n\"What became of the weapon?\"\n\n\"That is just the point on which I wish to satisfy myself. Excuse me\nfor a moment.\"\n\nMr. Sherlaw Kombs drew down the window on the right hand side, and\nexamined the top of the casing minutely with a magnifying glass.\nPresently he heaved a sigh of relief, and drew up the sash.\n\n\"Just as I expected,\" he remarked, speaking more to himself than to me.\n\"There is a slight dent on the top of the window-frame. It is of such a\nnature as to be made only by the trigger of a pistol falling from the\nnerveless hand of a suicide. He intended to throw the weapon far out of\nthe window, but had not the strength. It might have fallen into the\ncarriage. As a matter of fact, it bounced away from the line and lies\namong the grass about ten feet six inches from the outside rail. The\nonly question that now remains is where the deed was committed, and the\nexact present position of the pistol reckoned in miles from London, but\nthat, fortunately, is too simple to even need explanation.\"\n\n\"Great heavens, Sherlaw!\" I cried. \"How can you call that simple? It\nseems to me impossible to compute.\"\n\nWe were now flying over Northern London, and the great detective leaned\nback with every sign of _ennui_, closing his eyes. At last he\nspoke wearily:\n\n\"It is really too elementary, Whatson, but I am always willing to\noblige a friend. I shall be relieved, however, when you are able to\nwork out the A B C of detection for yourself, although I shall never\nobject to helping you with the words of more than three syllables.\nHaving made up his mind to commit suicide, Kipson naturally intended to\ndo it before he reached Brewster, because tickets are again examined at\nthat point. When the train began to stop at the signal near Pegram, he\ncame to the false conclusion that it was stopping at Brewster. The fact\nthat the shot was not heard is accounted for by the screech of the air-\nbrake, added to the noise of the train. Probably the whistle was also\nsounding at the same moment. The train being a fast express would stop\nas near the signal as possible. The air-brake will stop a train in\ntwice its own length. Call it three times in this case. Very well. At\nthree times the length of this train from the signalpost towards\nLondon, deducting half the length of the train, as this carriage is in\nthe middle, you will find the pistol.\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Commonplace,\" he murmured.\n\nAt this moment the whistle sounded shrilly, and we felt the grind of\nthe air-brakes.\n\n\"The Pegram signal again,\" cried Kombs, with something almost like\nenthusiasm. \"This is indeed luck. We will get out here, Whatson, and\ntest the matter.\"\n\nAs the train stopped, we got out on the right-hand side of the line.\nThe engine stood panting impatiently under the red light, which changed\nto green as I looked at it. As the train moved on with increasing\nspeed, the detective counted the carriages, and noted down the number.\nIt was now dark, with the thin crescent of the moon hanging in the\nwestern sky throwing a weird half-light on the shining metals. The rear\nlamps of the train disappeared around a curve, and the signal stood at\nbaleful red again. The black magic of the lonesome night in that\nstrange place impressed me, but the detective was a most practical man.\nHe placed his back against the signal-post, and paced up the line with\neven strides, counting his steps. I walked along the permanent way\nbeside him silently. At last he stopped, and took a tapeline from his\npocket. He ran it out until the ten feet six inches were unrolled,\nscanning the figures in the wan light of the new moon. Giving me the\nend, he placed his knuckles on the metals, motioning me to proceed down\nthe embankment. I stretched out the line, and then sank my hand in the\ndamp grass to mark the spot.\n\n\"Good God!\" I cried, aghast, \"what is this?\"\n\n\"It is the pistol,\" said Kombs quietly.\n\nIt was!!\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nJournalistic London will not soon forget the sensation that was caused\nby the record of the investigations of Sherlaw Kombs, as printed at\nlength in the next day's _Evening Blade_. Would that my story\nended here. Alas! Kombs contemptuously turned over the pistol to\nScotland Yard. The meddlesome officials, actuated, as I always hold, by\njealousy, found the name of the seller upon it. They investigated. The\nseller testified that it had never been in the possession of Mr.\nKipson, as far as he knew. It was sold to a man whose description\ntallied with that of a criminal long watched by the police. He was\narrested, and turned Queen's evidence in the hope of hanging his pal.\nIt seemed that Mr. Kipson, who was a gloomy, taciturn man, and usually\ncame home in a compartment by himself, thus escaping observation, had\nbeen murdered in the lane leading to his house. After robbing him, the\nmiscreants turned their thoughts towards the disposal of the body--a\nsubject that always occupies a first-class criminal mind before the\ndeed is done. They agreed to place it on the line, and have it mangled\nby the Scotch Express, then nearly due. Before they got the body half-\nway up the embankment the express came along and stopped. The guard got\nout and walked along the other side to speak with the engineer. The\nthought of putting the body into an empty first-class carriage\ninstantly occurred to the murderers. They opened the door with the\ndeceased's key. It is supposed that the pistol dropped when they were\nhoisting the body in the carriage.\n\nThe Queen's evidence dodge didn't work, and Scotland Yard ignobly\ninsulted my friend Sherlaw Kombs by sending him a pass to see the\nvillains hanged.\n\n\n\n\nDEATH COMETH SOON OR LATE.\n\n\nIt was Alick Robbins who named the invalid the Living Skeleton, and\nprobably remorse for having thus given him a title so descriptively\naccurate, caused him to make friends with the Living Skeleton, a man\nwho seemed to have no friends.\n\nRobbins never forgot their first conversation. It happened in this way.\nIt was the habit of the Living Skeleton to leave his hotel every\nmorning promptly at ten o'clock, if the sun was shining, and to shuffle\nrather than walk down the gravel street to the avenue of palms. There,\npicking out a seat on which the sun shone, the Living Skeleton would\nsit down and seem to wait patiently for someone who never came. He wore\na shawl around his neck and a soft cloth cap on his skull. Every bone\nin his face stood out against the skin, for there seemed to be no\nflesh, and his clothes hung as loosely upon him as they would have upon\na skeleton. It required no second glance at the Living Skeleton to know\nthat the remainder of his life was numbered by days or hours, and not\nby weeks or months. He didn't seem to have energy enough even to read,\nand so it was that Robbins sat down one day on the bench beside him,\nand said sympathetically:--\n\n\"I hope you are feeling better to-day.\"\n\nThe Skeleton turned towards him, laughed a low, noiseless, mirthless\nlaugh for a moment, and then said, in a hollow, far-away voice that had\nno lungs behind it: \"I am done with feeling either better or worse.\"\n\n\"Oh, I trust it is not so bad as that,\" said Robbins; \"the climate is\ndoing you good down here, is it not?\"\n\nAgain the Skeleton laughed silently, and Robbins began to feel uneasy.\nThe Skeleton's eyes were large and bright, and they fastened themselves\nupon Robbins in a way that increased that gentleman's uneasiness, and\nmade him think that perhaps the Skeleton knew he had so named him.\n\n\"I have no more interest in climate,\" said the Skeleton. \"I merely seem\nto live because I have been in the habit of living for some years; I\npresume that is it, because my lungs are entirely gone. Why I can talk\nor why I can breathe is a mystery to me. You are perfectly certain you\ncan hear me?\"\n\n\"Oh, I hear you quite distinctly,\" said Robbins.\n\n\"Well, if it wasn't that people tell me that they can hear me, I\nwouldn't believe I was really speaking, because, you see, I have\nnothing to speak with. Isn't it Shakespeare who says something about\nwhen the brains are out the man is dead? Well, I have seen some men who\nmake me think Shakespeare was wrong in his diagnosis, but it is\ngenerally supposed that when the lungs are gone a man is dead. To tell\nthe truth, I _am_ dead, practically. You know the old American\nstory about the man who walked around to save funeral expenses; well,\nit isn't quite that way with me, but I can appreciate how the man felt.\nStill I take a keen interest in life, although you might not think so.\nYou see, I haven't much time left; I am going to die at eight o'clock\non the 30th of April. Eight o'clock at night, not in the morning, just\nafter _table d'h\u00f4te_.\"\n\n\"You are going to _what_!\" cried Robbins in astonishment.\n\n\"I'm going to die that day. You see I have got things to such a fine\npoint, that I can die any time I want to. I could die right here, now,\nif I wished. If you have any mortal interest in the matter I'll do it,\nand show you what I say is true. I don't mind much, you know, although\nI had fixed April the 30th as the limit. It wouldn't matter a bit for\nme to go off now, if it would be of any interest to you.\"\n\n\"I beg you,\" said Robbins, very much alarmed, \"not to try any\nexperiments on my account. I am quite willing to believe anything you\nsay about the matter--of course you ought to know.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do know.\" answered the Living Skeleton sadly. \"Of course I have\nhad my struggle with hope and fear, but that is all past now, as you\nmay well understand. The reason that I have fixed the date for April\n30th is this: you see I have only a certain amount of money--I do not\nknow why I should make any secret of it. I have exactly 240 francs\ntoday, over and above another 100 francs which I have set aside for\nanother purpose. I am paying 8 francs a day at the Golden Dragon; that\nwill keep me just thirty days, and then I intend to die.\"\n\nThe Skeleton laughed again, without sound, and Robbins moved uneasily\non the seat.\n\n\"I don't see,\" he said finally, \"what there is to laugh about in that\ncondition of affairs.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose there is very much; but there is something else that I\nconsider very laughable, and that I will tell you if you will keep it a\nsecret. You see, the Golden Dragon himself--I always call our innkeeper\nthe Golden Dragon, just as you call me, the Living Skeleton.\"\n\n\"Oh, I--I--beg your pardon,\" stammered Robbins, \"I----.\"\n\n\"It really doesn't matter at all. You are perfectly right, and I think\nit a very apt term. Well, the old Golden Dragon makes a great deal of\nhis money by robbing the dead. You didn't know that, did you? You\nthought it was the living who supported him, and goodness knows he robs\n_them_ when he has a chance. Well, you are very much mistaken.\nWhen a man dies in the Golden Dragon, he, or his friends rather, have\nto pay very sweetly for it. The Dragon charges them for re-furnishing\nthe room. Every stick of furniture is charged for, all the wall-paper,\nand so on. I suppose it is perfectly right to charge something, but the\nDragon is not content with what is right. He knows he has finally lost\na customer, and so he makes all he can out of him. The furniture so\npaid for, is not re-placed, and the walls are not papered again, but\nthe Dragon doesn't abate a penny of his bill on that account. Now, I\nhave inquired of the furnishing man, on the street back of the hotel,\nand he has written on his card just the cost of mattress, sheets,\npillows, and all that sort of thing, and the amount comes to about 50\nfrancs. I have put in an envelope a 50-franc note, and with it the card\nof the furniture man. I have written a letter to the hotel-keeper,\ntelling him just what the things will cost that he needs, and have\nreferred the Dragon to the card of the furniture man who has given me\nthe figures. This envelope I have addressed to the Dragon, and he will\nfind it when I am dead. This is the joke that old man Death and myself\nhave put up on our host, and my only regret is that I shall not be able\nto enjoy a look at the Dragon's countenance as he reads my last letter\nto him. Another sum of money I have put away, in good hands where he\nwon't have a chance to get it, for my funeral expenses, and then you\nsee I am through with the world. I have nobody to leave that I need\nworry about, or who would either take care of me or feel sorry for me\nif I needed care or sympathy, which I do not. So that is why I laugh,\nand that is why I come down and sit upon this bench, in the sunshine,\nand enjoy the posthumous joke.\"\n\nRobbins did not appear to see the humor of the situation quite as\nstrongly as the Living Skeleton did. At different times after, when\nthey met he had offered the Skeleton more money if he wanted it, so\nthat he might prolong his life a little, but the Skeleton always\nrefused.\n\nA sort of friendship sprang up between Robbins and the Living Skeleton,\nat least, as much of a friendship as can exist between the living and\nthe dead, for Robbins was a muscular young fellow who did not need to\nlive at the Riviera on account of his health, but merely because he\ndetested an English winter. Besides this, it may be added, although it\nreally is nobody's business, that a Nice Girl and her parents lived in\nthis particular part of the South of France.\n\nOne day Robbins took a little excursion in a carriage to Toulon. He had\ninvited the Nice Girl to go with him, but on that particular day she\ncould not go. There was some big charity function on hand, and one\nnecessary part of the affair was the wheedling of money out of people's\npockets, so the Nice Girl had undertaken to do part of the wheedling.\n\nShe was very good at it, and she rather prided herself upon it, but\nthen she was a very nice girl, pretty as well, and so people found it\ndifficult to refuse her. On the evening of the day there was to be a\nball at the principal hotel of the place, also in connection with this\nvery desirable charity. Robbins had reluctantly gone to Toulon alone,\nbut you may depend upon it he was back in time for the ball.\n\n\"Well,\" he said to the Nice Girl when he met her, \"what luck\ncollecting, to-day?\"\n\n\"Oh, the greatest luck,\" she replied enthusiastically, \"and whom do you\nthink I got the most money from?\"\n\n\"I am sure I haven't the slightest idea--that old English Duke, he\ncertainly has money enough.\"\n\n\"No, not from him at all; the very last person you would expect it\nfrom--your friend, the Living Skeleton.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Robbins, in alarm.\n\n\"Oh, I found him on the bench where he usually sits, in the avenue of\nthe palms. I told him all about the charity and how useful it was, and\nhow necessary, and how we all ought to give as much as we could towards\nit, and he smiled and smiled at me in that curious way of his. 'Yes,'\nhe said in a whisper, 'I believe the charity should be supported by\neveryone; I will give you eighty francs.' Now, wasn't that very\ngenerous of him? Eighty francs, that was ten times what the Duke gave,\nand as he handed me the money he looked up at me and said in that awful\nwhisper of his: 'Count this over carefully when you get home and see if\nyou can find out what else I have given you. There is more than eighty\nfrancs there.' Then, after I got home, I----\"\n\nBut here the Nice Girl paused, when she looked at the face of Robbins,\nto whom she was talking. That face was ghastly pale and his eyes were\nstaring at her but not seeing her.\n\n\"Eighty francs,\" he was whispering to himself, and he seemed to be\nmaking a mental calculation. Then noticing the Nice Girl's amazed look\nat him, he said:\n\n\"Did you take the money?\"\n\n\"Of course I took it,\" she said, \"why shouldn't I?\"\n\n\"Great Heavens!\" gasped Robbins, and without a word he turned and fled,\nleaving the Nice Girl transfixed with astonishment and staring after\nhim with a frown on her pretty brow.\n\n\"What does he mean by such conduct?\" she asked herself. But Robbins\ndisappeared from the gathering throng in the large room of the hotel,\ndashed down the steps, and hurried along the narrow pavements toward\nthe \"Golden Dragon.\" The proprietor was standing in the hallway with\nhis hands behind him, a usual attitude with the Dragon.\n\n\"Where,\" gasped Robbins, \"is Mr.--Mr.----\" and then he remembered he\ndidn't know the name. \"Where is the Living Skeleton?\"\n\n\"He has gone to his room,\" answered the Dragon, \"he went early to-\nnight, he wasn't feeling well, I think.\"\n\n\"What is the number of his room?\"\n\n\"No. 40,\" and the proprietor rang a loud, jangling bell, whereupon one\nof the chambermaids appeared. \"Show this gentleman to No. 40.\"\n\nThe girl preceded Robbins up the stairs. Once she looked over her\nshoulder, and said in a whisper, \"Is he worse?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" answered Robbins, \"that's what I have come to see.\"\n\nAt No. 40 the girl paused, and rapped lightly on the door panel. There\nwas no response. She rapped again, this time louder. There was still no\nresponse.\n\n\"Try the door,\" said Robbins.\n\n\"I am afraid to,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because he said if he were asleep the door would be locked, and if he\nwere dead the door would be open.\"\n\n\"When did he say that?\"\n\n\"He said it several times, sir; about a week ago the last time.\"\n\nRobbins turned the handle of the door; it was not locked. A dim light\nwas in the room, but a screen before the door hid it from sight. When\nhe passed round the screen he saw, upon the square marble-topped\narrangement at the head of the bed, a candle burning, and its light\nshone on the dead face of the Skeleton, which had a grim smile on its\nthin lips, while in its clenched hand was a letter addressed to the\nproprietor of the hotel.\n\nThe Living Skeleton had given more than the eighty francs to that\ndeserving charity.\n\n\n\n\nHIGH STAKES.\n\n\nThe snow was gently sifting down through the white glare of the\nelectric light when Pony Rowell buttoned his overcoat around him and\nleft the Metropolitan Hotel, which was his home. He was a young man,\nnot more than thirty, and his face was a striking one. It was clean cut\nand clean shaven. It might have been the face of an actor or the face\nof a statesman. An actor's face has a certain mobility of expression\nresulting from the habit of assuming characters differing widely.\nRowell's face, when you came to look at it closely, showed that it had\nbeen accustomed to repress expression rather than to show emotion of\nany kind. A casual look at Pony Rowell made you think his face would\ntell you something; a closer scrutiny showed you that it would tell you\nnothing. His eyes were of a piercing steely gray that seemed to read\nthe thoughts of others, while they effectually concealed his own. Pony\nRowell was known as a man who never went back on his word. He was a\nprofessional gambler.\n\nOn this particular evening he strolled up the avenue with the easy\ncarriage of a man of infinite leisure. He hesitated for a moment at an\nilly-lighted passage-way in the middle of a large building on a side\nstreet, then went in and mounted a stair. He rapped lightly at a door.\nA slide was shoved back and a man inside peered out at him for a\nmoment. Instantly the door was opened, for Pony's face was good for\nadmittance at any of the gambling rooms in the city. There was still\nanother guarded door to pass, for an honest gambling-house keeper can\nnever tell what streak of sudden morality may strike the police, and it\nis well to have a few moments' time in which to conceal the\nparaphernalia of the business. Of course, Mellish's gambling rooms were\nas well known to the police as to Pony Rowell, but unless some fuss was\nmade by the public, Mellish knew he would be free from molestation.\n\nMellish was a careful man, and a visitor had to be well vouched for,\nbefore he gained admission. There never was any trouble in Mellish's\nrooms. He was often known to advise a player to quit when he knew the\nyoung gambler could not afford to lose, and instances were cited where\nhe had been the banker of some man in despair. Everybody liked Mellish,\nfor his generosity was unbounded, and he told a good story well.\n\nInside the room that Pony Rowell had penetrated, a roulette table was\nat its whirling work and faro was going on in another spot. At small\ntables various visitors were enjoying the game of poker.\n\n\"Hello, Pony,\" cried Bert Ragstock, \"are you going to give me my\nrevenge to-night?\"\n\n\"I'm always willing to give anyone his revenge.\" answered Pony\nimperturbably, lighting a fresh cigarette.\n\n\"All right then; come and sit down here.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to play just yet. I want to look on for a while.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. I've been waiting for you ever so long already. Sit down.\"\n\n\"You ought to know by this time, Bert, that when I say a thing I mean\nit. I won't touch a card till the clock begins to strike 12. Then I'm\nwid ye.\"\n\n\"Pshaw, Pony, you ought to be above that sort of thing. That's\nsuperstition, Rowell. You're too cool a man to mind when you touch a\ncard. Come on.\"\n\n\"That's all right. At midnight, I said to myself, and at midnight it\nshall be or not at all.\"\n\nThe old gamblers in the place nodded approval of this resolution. It\nwas all right enough for Bert Ragstock to sneer at superstition,\nbecause he was not a real gambler. He merely came to Mellish's rooms in\nthe evening because the Stock Exchange did not keep open all night.\nStrange to say Ragstock was a good business man as well as a cool\ngambler. He bemoaned the fate that made him so rich that gambling had\nnot the exhilarating effect on him which it would have had if he had\nbeen playing in desperation.\n\nWhen the clock began to chime midnight Pony Rowell took up the pack and\nbegan to shuffle.\n\n\"Now, old man,\" he said, \"I'm going in to win. I'm after big game to-\nnight.\"\n\n\"Right you are.\" cried Bert, with enthusiasm. \"I'll stand by you as\nlong as the spots stay on the cards.\"\n\nIn the gray morning, when most of the others had left and even Mellish\nhimself was yawning, they were still at it. The professional gambler\nhad won a large sum of money; the largest sum he ever possessed. Yet\nthere was no gleam of triumph in his keen eyes. Bert might have been\nwinning for all the emotion his face showed. They were a well matched\npair, and they enjoyed playing with each other.\n\n\"There,\" cried Pony at last, \"haven't you had enough? Luck's against\nyou. I wouldn't run my head any longer against a brick wall, if I were\nyou.\"\n\n\"My dear Pony, how often have I told you there is no such thing as\nluck. But to tell the truth I'm tired and I'm going home. The revenge\nis postponed. When do I meet the enemy again?\"\n\nPony Rowell shuffled the cards idly for a few moments without replying\nor raising his eyes. At last he said:\n\n\"The next time I play you, Bert, it will be for high stakes.\"\n\n\"Good heavens, aren't you satisfied with the stakes we played for to-\nnight?\"\n\n\"No. I want to play you for a stake that will make even your hair stand\non end. Will you do it?\"\n\n\"Certainly. When?\"\n\n\"That I can't tell just yet. I have a big scheme on hand. I am to see a\nman to-day about it. All I want to know is that you promise to play.\"\n\n\"Pony, this is mysterious. I guess you're not afraid I will flunk out.\nI'm ready to meet you on any terms and for any stake.\"\n\n\"Enough said. I'll let you know some of the particulars as soon as I\nfind out all I want myself. Good-night.\"\n\n\"Good-night to you, rather,\" said Bert, as Mellish helped him on with\nhis overcoat. \"You've won the pile: robbing a poor man of his hard-\nearned gains!\"\n\n\"Oh, the poor man does not need the money as badly as I do. Besides,\nI'm going to give you a chance to win it all back again and more.\"\n\nWhen Ragstock had left, Pony still sat by the table absent-mindedly\nshuffling the cards.\n\n\"If I were you,\" said Mellish, laying his hand on his shoulder, \"I\nwould put that pile in the bank and quit.\"\n\n\"The faro bank?\" asked Pony, looking up with a smile.\n\n\"No, I'd quit the business altogether if I were you. I'm going to\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Oh, we all know that. You've been going to quit for the last twenty\nyears. Well, I'm going to quit, too, but not just yet. That's what they\nall say, of course, but I mean it.\"\n\nIn the early and crisp winter air Pony Rowell walked to the\nMetropolitan Hotel and to bed. At 3 that afternoon the man he had an\nappointment with, called to see him.\n\n\"You wanted to see me about an Insurance policy,\" the visitor began. An\nagent is always ready to talk of business. \"Now, were you thinking of\nan endowment scheme or have you looked into our new bond system of\ninsurance? The twenty-pay-life style of thing seems to be very\npopular.\"\n\n\"I want to ask you a few questions,\" said Pony. \"If I were to insure my\nlife in your company and were to commit suicide would that invalidate\nthe policy?\"\n\n\"Not after two years. After two years, in our company, the policy is\nincontestable.\"\n\n\"Two years? That won't do for me. Can't you make it one year?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what I will do,\" said the agent, lowering his voice, \"I\ncan ante-date the policy, so that the two years will end just when you\nlike, say a year from now.\"\n\n\"Very well. If you can legally fix it so that the two years come to an\nend about this date next year I will insure in your company for\n$100,000.\"\n\nThe agent opened his eyes when the amount was mentioned.\n\n\"I don't want endowments or bonds, but the cheapest form of life\ninsurance you have, and----\"\n\n\"Straight life is what you want.\"\n\n\"Straight life it is, then, and I will pay you for the two years or\nsay, to make it sure, for two years and a half down, when you bring me\nthe papers.\"\n\nThus it was that with part of the money he had won, Pony Rowell insured\nhis life for $100,000, and with another part he paid his board and\nlodging for a year ahead at the Metropolitan Hotel.\n\nThe remainder he kept to speculate on.\n\nDuring the year that followed he steadily refused to play with Bert\nRagstock, and once or twice they nearly had a quarrel about it--that is\nas near as Pony could come to having a row with anybody, for\nquarrelling was not in his line. If he had lived in a less civilized\npart of the community Pony might have shot, but as it was quarrels\nnever came to anything, therefore he did not indulge in any.\n\n\"A year from the date of our last game? What nonsense it is waiting all\nthat time. You play with others, why not with me? Think of the chances\nwe are losing,\" complained Bert.\n\n\"We will have a game then that will make up for all the waiting,\"\nanswered Rowell.\n\nAt last the anniversary came and when the hour struck that ushered it\nin Pony Rowell and Bert Ragstock sat facing each other, prepared to\nresume business on the old stand.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Bert, rubbing his hands, \"it feels good to get opposite you\nonce more. Pony, you're a crank. We might have had a hundred games like\nthis during the past year, if there wasn't so much superstition about\nyou.\"\n\n\"Not quite like this. This is to be the last game I play, win or lose.\nI tell you that now, so that there won't be any talk of revenge if I\nwin.\"\n\n\"You don't mean it! I've heard talk like that before.\"\n\n\"All right. I've warned you. Now I propose that this be a game of pure\nluck. We get a new pack of cards, shuffle them, cut, then you pull one\ncard and I another. Ace high. The highest takes the pot. Best two out\nof three. Do you agree?\"\n\n\"Of course. How much is the pile to be?\"\n\n\"One hundred thousand dollars.\"\n\n\"Oh, you're dreaming.\"\n\n\"Isn't it enough?\"\n\n\"Thunder! You never _saw_ $100,000.\"\n\n\"You will get the money if I lose.\"\n\n\"Say, Pony, that's coming it a little strong. One hundred thousand\ndollars! Heavens and earth! How many business men in this whole city\nwould expect their bare word to be taken for $100,000?\"\n\n\"I'm not a business man. I'm a gambler.\"\n\n\"True, true. Is the money in sight?\"\n\n\"No; but you'll be paid. Your money is not in sight. I trust you. Can't\nyou trust me?\n\n\"It isn't quite the same thing, Pony. I'll trust you for three times\nthe money you have in sight, but when you talk about $100,000 you are\ntalking of a lot of cash.\"\n\n\"If I can convince Mellish here that you will get your money, will you\nplay?\"\n\n\"You can convince me just as easily as you can Mellish. What's the use\nof dragging him in?\"\n\n\"I could convince you in a minute, but you might still refuse to play.\nNow I'm bound to play this game and I can't take any risks. If my word\nand Mellish's isn't good enough for you, why, say so.\"\n\n\"All right,\" cried Bert. \"If you can convince Mellish that you will pay\nif you lose I'll play you.\"\n\nRowell and Mellish retired into an inner room and after a few minutes\nreappeared again.\n\nMellish's face was red when he went in. He was now a trifle pale.\n\n\"I don't like this, Bert,\" Mellish said, \"and I think this game had\nbetter stop right here.\"\n\n\"Then you are not convinced that I am sure of my money?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am, but----\"\n\n\"That's enough for me. Get out your new pack.\"\n\n\"You've given your word, Mellish,\" said Pony, seeing the keeper of the\nhouse was about to speak. \"Don't say any more.\"\n\n\"For such a sum two out of three is too sudden. Make it five out of\nnine,\" put in Bert.\n\n\"I'm willing.\"\n\nThe new pack of cards was brought and the wrappings torn off.\n\n\"You shuffle first; I'll cut,\" said Rowell. His lips seemed parched and\nhe moistened them now and then, which was unusual for so cool a\ngambler. Mellish fidgeted around with lowered brow. Bert shuffled the\ncards as nonchalantly as if he had merely a $5 bill on the result. When\neach had taken a card, Bert held an ace and Pony a king. Pony shuffled\nand the turn up was a spot in Pony's hand and queen in that of his\nopponent. Bert smiled and drops began to show on Pony's forehead in\nspite of his efforts at self-control. No word was spoken by either\nplayers or onlookers. After the next deal Pony again lost. His\nimperturbability seemed to be leaving him. He swept the cards from the\ntable with an oath. \"Bring another pack,\" he said hoarsely.\n\nBert smiled at him across the table. He thought, of course, that they\nwere playing for even stakes.\n\nMellish couldn't stand it any longer. He retired to one of the inner\nrooms. The first deal with the new pack turned in Pony's favor and he\nseemed to feel that his luck had changed, but the next deal went\nagainst him and also the one following.\n\n\"It's your shuffle,\" said Rowell, pushing the cards towards his\nopponent. Bert did not touch the cards, but smiled across at the\ngambler.\n\n\"What's the matter with you? Why don't you shuffle?\"\n\n\"I don't have to,\" said Bert, quietly, \"I've won five.\"\n\nRowell drew his hand across his perspiring brow and stared at the man\nacross the table. Then he seemed to pull himself together.\n\n\"So you have,\" he said, \"I hadn't noticed it. Excuse me. I guess I'll\ngo now.\"\n\n\"Sit where you are and let us have a game for something more modest. I\ndon't care about these splurges myself and I don't suppose you do--\nnow.\"\n\n\"Thanks, no. I told you this was my last game. As to the splurge, if I\nhad the money I would willingly try it again. So long.\"\n\nWhen Mellish came in and saw that the game was over he asked where Pony\nwas.\n\n\"He knew when he had enough, I guess,\" answered Bert. \"He's gone home.\"\n\n\"Come in here, Bert. I want to speak with you,\" said Mellish.\n\nWhen they were alone Mellish turned to him.\n\n\"I suppose Pony didn't tell you where the money is to come from?\"\n\n\"No, he told you. That was enough for me.\"\n\n\"Well, there's no reason why you should not know now. I promised\nsilence till the game was finished. He's insured his life for $100,000\nand is going to commit suicide so that you may be paid.\"\n\n\"My God!\" cried Bert, aghast. \"Why did you let the game go on?\"\n\n\"I tried to stop it, but I had given my word and you----\"\n\n\"Well, don't let us stand chattering here. He's at the Metropolitan,\nisn't he? Then come along. Hurry into your coat.\"\n\nMellish knew the number of Rowell's room and so no time was lost in the\nhotel office with inquiries. He tried the door, but, as he expected, it\nwas locked.\n\n\"Who's that?\" cried a voice within.\n\n\"It's me--Mellish. I want to speak with you a moment.\"\n\n\"I don't want to see you.\"\n\n\"Bert wants to say something. It's important. Let us in.\"\n\n\"I won't let you in. Go away and don't make a fuss. It will do no good.\nYou can get in ten minutes from now.\"\n\n\"Look here, Pony, you open that door at once, or I'll kick it in. You\nhear me? I want to see you a minute, and then you can do what you\nlike,\" said Bert, in a voice that meant business.\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation Rowell opened the door and the two stepped\nin. Half of the carpet had been taken up and the bare floor was covered\nwith old newspapers. A revolver lay on the table, also writing\nmaterials and a half-finished letter. Pony was in his shirt sleeves and\nhe did not seem pleased at the interruption.\n\n\"What do you want?\" he asked shortly.\n\n\"Look here, Pony,\" said Bert, \"I have confessed to Mellish and I've\ncome to confess to you. I want you to be easy with me and hush the\nthing up. I cheated. I stocked the cards.\"\n\n\"You're a liar,\" said Rowell, looking him straight in the eye.\n\n\"Don't say that again,\" cried Ragstock, with his fingers twitching.\n\"There's mighty few men I would take that from.\"\n\n\"You stocked the cards on me? I'd like to see the man that could do\nit!\"\n\n\"You were excited and didn't notice it.\"\n\n\"You're not only a liar, but you're an awkward liar. I have lost the\nmoney and I'll pay it. It would have been ready for you now, only I had\na letter to write. Mellish has told you about the insurance policy and\nmy will attached to it. Here they are. They're yours. I'm no kicker. I\nknow when a game's played fair.\"\n\nBert took the policy and evidently intended to tear it in pieces, while\nMellish, with a wink at him, edged around to get at the revolver.\nRagstock's eye caught the name in big letters at the head of the\npolicy, beautifully engraved. His eyes opened wide, then he sank into a\nchair and roared with laughter. Both the other men looked at him in\nastonishment.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Mellish.\n\n\"Matter? Why, this would have been a joke on Pony. It would do both of\nyou some good to know a little about business as well as of gambling.\nThe Hardfast Life Insurance Company went smash six months ago. It's the\ntruth this time, Pony, even if I didn't stock the cards. Better make\nsome inquiries in business circles before you try to collect any money\nfrom this institution. Now, Pony, order up the drinks, if anything can\nbe had at this untimely hour. We are your guests so you are expected to\nbe hospitable. I've had all the excitement I want for one night. We'll\ncall it square and begin over again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\"WHERE IGNORANCE IS BLISS.\"\n\n\nThe splendid steamship Adamant, of the celebrated Cross Bow line, left\nNew York on her February trip under favorable auspices. There had just\nbeen a storm on the ocean, so there was every chance that she would\nreach Liverpool before the next one was due.\n\nCapt. Rice had a little social problem to solve at the outset, but he\nsmoothed that out with the tact which is characteristic of him. Two\nWashington ladies--official ladies--were on board, and the captain, old\nBritish sea-dog that he was, always had trouble in the matter of\nprecedence with Washington ladies. Capt. Rice never had any bother with\nthe British aristocracy, because precedence is all set down in the\nbulky volume of \"Burke's Peerage,\" which the captain kept in his cabin,\nand so there was no difficulty. But a republican country is supposed\nnot to meddle with precedence. It wouldn't, either, if it weren't for\nthe women.\n\nSo it happened that Mrs. Assistant-Attorney-to-the-Senate Brownrig came\nto the steward and said that, ranking all others on board, she must sit\nat the right hand of the captain. Afterwards Mrs. Second-Adjutant-to-\nthe-War-Department Digby came to the same perplexed official and said\nshe must sit at the captain's right hand because in Washington she took\nprecedence over everyone else on board. The bewildered steward confided\nhis woes to the captain, and the captain said he would attend to the\nmatter. So he put Mrs. War-Department on his right hand and then walked\ndown the deck with Mrs. Assistant-Attorney and said to her:\n\n\"I want to ask a favor, Mrs. Brownrig. Unfortunately I am a little deaf\nin the right ear, caused, I presume, by listening so much with that ear\nto the fog horn year in and year out. Now, I always place the lady\nwhose conversation I wish most to enjoy on my left hand at table. Would\nyou oblige me by taking that seat this voyage? I have heard of you, you\nsee, Mrs. Brownrig, although you have never crossed with me before.\"\n\n\"Why, certainly, captain,\" replied Mrs. Brownrig; \"I feel especially\ncomplimented.\"\n\n\"And I assure you, madam,\" said the polite captain, \"that I would not\nfor the world miss a single word that,\" etc.\n\nAnd thus it was amicably arranged between the two ladies. All this has\nnothing whatever to do with the story. It is merely an incident given\nto show what a born diplomat Capt. Rice was and is to this day. I don't\nknow any captain more popular with the ladies than he, and besides he\nis as good a sailor as crosses the ocean.\n\nDay by day the good ship ploughed her way toward the east, and the\npassengers were unanimous in saying that they never had a pleasanter\nvoyage for that time of the year. It was so warm on deck that many\nsteamer chairs were out, and below it was so mild that a person might\nthink he was journeying in the tropics. Yet they had left New York in a\nsnow storm with the thermometer away below zero.\n\n\"Such,\" said young Spinner, who knew everything, \"such is the influence\nof the Gulf Stream.\"\n\nNevertheless when Capt. Rice came down to lunch the fourth day out his\nface was haggard and his look furtive and anxious.\n\n\"Why, captain,\" cried Mrs. Assistant-Attorney, you look as if you\nhadn't slept a wink last night.\"\n\n\"I slept very well, thank you, madam.\" replied the captain. \"I always\ndo.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope your room was more comfortable than mine. It seemed to me\ntoo hot for anything. Didn't you find it so, Mrs. Digby?\"\n\n\"I thought it very nice,\" replied the lady at the captain's right, who\ngenerally found it necessary to take an opposite view from the lady at\nthe left.\n\n\"You see,\" said the captain, \"we have many delicate women and children\non board and it is necessary to keep up the temperature. Still, perhaps\nthe man who attends to the steam rather overdoes it. I will speak him.\"\n\nThen the captain pushed from him his untasted food and went up on the\nbridge, casting his eye aloft at the signal waving from the masthead,\nsilently calling for help to all the empty horizon.\n\n\"Nothing in sight, Johnson?\" said the captain.\n\n\"Not a speck, sir.\"\n\nThe captain swept the circular line of sea and sky with his glasses,\nthen laid them down with a sigh.\n\n\"We ought to raise something this afternoon, sir,\" said Johnson; \"we\nare right in their track, sir. The Fulda ought to be somewhere about.\"\n\n\"We are too far north for the Fulda, I am afraid,\" answered the\ncaptain.\n\n\"Well, sir, we should see the Vulcan before night, sir. She's had good\nweather from Queenstown.\"\n\n\"Yes. Keep a sharp lookout, Johnson.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nThe captain moodily paced the bridge with his head down.\n\n\"I ought to have turned back to New York,\" he said to himself.\n\nThen he went down to his own room, avoiding the passengers as much as\nhe could, and had the steward bring him some beef-tea. Even a captain\ncannot live on anxiety.\n\n\"Steamer off the port bow, sir,\" rang out the voice of the lookout at\nthe prow. The man had sharp eyes, for a landsman could have seen\nnothing.\n\n\"Run and tell the captain,\" cried Johnson to the sailor at his elbow,\nbut as the sailor turned the captain's head appeared up the stairway.\nHe seized the glass and looked long at a single point in the horizon.\n\n\"It must be the Vulcan,\" he said at last.\n\n\"I think so, sir.\"\n\n\"Turn your wheel a few points to port and bear down on her.\"\n\nJohnson gave the necessary order and the great ship veered around.\n\n\"Hello!\" cried Spinner, on deck. \"Here's a steamer. I found her. She's\nmine.\"\n\nThen there was a rush to the side of the ship. \"A steamer in sight!\"\nwas the cry, and all books and magazines at once lost interest. Even\nthe placid, dignified Englishman who was so uncommunicative, rose from\nhis chair and sent his servant for his binocular. Children were held up\nand told to be careful, while they tried to see the dim line of smoke\nso far ahead.\n\n\"Talk about lane routes at sea,\" cried young Spinner, the knowing.\n\"Bosh, I say. See! we're going directly for her. Think what it might be\nin a fog! Lane routes! Pure luck, I call it.\"\n\n\"Will we signal to her, Mr. Spinner?\" gently asked the young lady from\nBoston.\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" answered young Spinner. \"See there's our signal flying\nfrom the masthead now. That shows them what line we belong to.\"\n\n\"Dear me, how interesting,\" said the young lady. \"You have crossed many\ntimes, I suppose, Mr. Spinner.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know my way about,\" answered the modest Spinner.\n\nThe captain kept the glasses glued to his eyes. Suddenly he almost let\nthem drop.\n\n\"My God! Johnson,\" he cried.\n\n\"What is it, sir?\"\n\n\"_She's_ flying a signal of distress, _too_!\"\n\nThe two steamers slowly approached each other and, when nearly\nalongside and about a mile apart, the bell of the Adamant rang to stop.\n\n\"There, you see,\" said young Spinner to the Boston girl, \"she is flying\nthe same flag at her masthead that we are.\"\n\n\"Then she belongs to the same line as this boat?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" answered Mr. Cock-Sure Spinner.\n\n\"Oh, look! look! look!\" cried the enthusiastic Indianapolis girl who\nwas going to take music in Germany.\n\nEveryone looked aloft and saw running up to the masthead a long line of\nfluttering, many-colored flags. They remained in place for a few\nmoments and then fluttered down again, only to give place to a\ndifferent string. The same thing was going on on the other steamer.\n\n\"Oh, this is too interesting for anything,\" said Mrs. Assistant. \"I am\njust dying to know what it all means. I have read of it so often but\nnever saw it before. I wonder when the captain will come down. What\ndoes it all mean?\" she asked the deck steward.\n\n\"They are signalling to each other, madam.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know _that_. But what _are_ they signalling?\"\n\n\"I don't know, madam.\"\n\n\"Oh, see! see!\" cried the Indianapolis girl, clapping her hands with\ndelight. \"The other steamer is turning round.\"\n\nIt was indeed so. The great ship was thrashing the water with her\nscrew, and gradually the masts came in line and then her prow faced the\neast again. When this had been slowly accomplished the bell on the\nAdamant rang full speed ahead, and then the captain came slowly down\nthe ladder that led from the bridge.\n\n\"Oh, captain, what does it all mean?\"\n\n\"Is she going back, captain? Nothing wrong, I hope.\"\n\n\"What ship is it, captain?\"\n\n\"She belongs to our line, doesn't she?\"\n\n\"Why is she going back?\"\n\n\"The ship,\" said the captain slowly, \"is the Vulcan, of the Black\nBowling Line, that left Queenstown shortly after we left New York. She\nhas met with an accident. Ran into some wreckage, it is thought, from\nthe recent storm. Anyhow there is a hole in her, and whether she sees\nQueenstown or not will depend a great deal on what weather we have and\nwhether her bulkheads hold out. We will stand by her till we reach\nQueenstown.\"\n\n\"Are there many on board, do you think, captain?\"\n\n\"There are thirty-seven in the cabin and over 800 steerage passengers,\"\nanswered the captain.\n\n\"Why don't you take them on board, out of danger, captain?\"\n\n\"Ah, madam, there is no need to do that. It would delay us, and time is\neverything in a case like this. Besides, they will have ample warning\nif she is going down and they will have time to get everybody in the\nboats. We will stand by them, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, the poor creatures,\" cried the sympathetic Mrs. Second-Adjutant.\n\"Think of their awful position. May be engulfed at any moment. I\nsuppose they are all on their knees in the cabin. How thankful they\nmust have been to see the Adamant.\"\n\nOn all sides there was the profoundest sympathy for the unfortunate\npassengers of the Vulcan. Cheeks paled at the very thought of the\ncatastrophe that might take place at any moment within sight of the\nsister ship. It was a realistic object lesson on the ever-present\ndangers of the sea. While those on deck looked with new interest at the\nsteamship plunging along within a mile of them, the captain slipped\naway to his room. As he sat there there was a tap at his door.\n\n\"Come in,\" shouted the captain.\n\nThe silent Englishman slowly entered.\n\n\"What's wrong, captain,\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, the Vulcan has had a hole stove in her and I signalled----\"\n\n\"Yes, I know all that, of course, but what's wrong _with us_?\"\n\n\"With us?\" echoed the captain blankly.\n\n\"Yes, with the Adamant? What has been amiss for the last two or three\ndays? I'm not a talker, nor am I afraid any more than you are, but I\nwant to know.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the captain. \"Please shut the door, Sir John.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nMeanwhile there was a lively row on board the Vulcan. In the saloon\nCapt. Flint was standing at bay with his knuckles on the table.\n\n\"Now what the devil's the meaning of all this?\" cried Adam K. Vincent,\nmember of Congress.\n\nA crowd of frightened women were standing around, many on the verge of\nhysterics. Children clung, with pale faces, to their mother's skirts,\nfearing they knew not what. Men were grouped with anxious faces, and\nthe bluff old captain fronted them all.\n\n\"The meaning of all _what_, sir?\"\n\n\"You know very well. What is the meaning of our turning-round?\"\n\n\"It means, sir, that the Adamant has eighty-five saloon passengers and\nnearly 500 intermediate and steerage passengers who are in the most\ndeadly danger. The cotton in the hold is on fire, and they have been\nfighting it night and day. A conflagration may break out at any moment.\nIt means, then, sir, that the Vulcan is going to stand by the Adamant.\"\n\nA wail of anguish burst from the frightened women at the awful fate\nthat might be in store for so many human beings so near to them, and\nthey clung closer to their children and thanked God that no such danger\nthreatened them and those dear to them.\n\n\"And dammit, sir,\" cried the Congressman, \"do you mean to tell us that\nwe have to go against our will--without even being consulted--back to\nQueenstown?\"\n\n\"I mean to tell you so, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, by the gods, that's an outrage, and I won't stand it, sir. I\nmust be in New York by the 27th. I won't stand it, sir.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry, sir, that anybody should be delayed.\"\n\n\"Delayed? Hang it all, why don't you take the people on board and take\n'em to New York? I protest against this. I'll bring a lawsuit against\nthe company, sir.\"\n\n\"Mr. Vincent,\" said the captain sternly, \"permit me to remind you that\n_I_ am captain of this ship. Good afternoon, sir.\"\n\nThe Congressman departed from the saloon exceeding wroth, breathing\ndire threats of legal proceedings against the line and the captain\npersonally, but most of the passengers agreed that it would be an\ninhuman thing to leave the Adamant alone in mid-ocean in such terrible\nstraits.\n\n\"Why didn't they turn back, Captain Flint?\" asked Mrs. General Weller.\n\n\"Because, madam, every moment is of value in such a case, and we are\nnearer Queenstown than New York.\"\n\nAnd so the two steamships, side by side, worried their way toward the\neast, always within sight of each other by day, and with the rows of\nlights in each visible at night to the sympathetic souls on the other.\nThe sweltering men poured water into the hold of the one and the\npounding pumps poured water out of the hold of the other, and thus they\nreached Queenstown.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nOn board the tender that took the passengers ashore at Queenstown from\nboth steamers two astonished women met each other.\n\n\"Why! _Mrs.--General_--WELLER!!! You don't mean to say you were on\nboard that unfortunate Vulcan!\"\n\n\"For the land's sake, Mrs. Assistant Brownrig! Is that really\n_you_? Will wonders never cease? Unfortunate, did you say?\nMightily fortunate for you, I think. Why! weren't you just frightened\nto death?\"\n\n\"I was, but I had no idea anyone I knew was on board.\"\n\n\"Well, you were on board yourself. That would have been enough to have\nkilled me.\"\n\n\"On board myself? Why, what _do_ you mean? I wasn't on board the\nVulcan. Did you get any sleep at all after you knew you might go down\nat any moment?\"\n\n\"My sakes, Jane, what _are_ you talking about? _Down_ at any\nmoment? It was you that might have gone down at any moment or, worse\nstill, have been burnt to death if the fire had got ahead. You don't\nmean to say you didn't know the Adamant was on fire most of the way\nacross?\"\n\n\"_Mrs.--General--Weller!!_ There's some _horrible_ mistake.\nIt was the Vulcan. Everything depended on her bulkheads, the captain\nsaid. There was a hole as big as a barn door in the Vulcan. The pumps\nwere going night and day.\"\n\nMrs. General looked at Mrs. Assistant as the light began to dawn on\nboth of them.\n\n\"Then it wasn't the engines, but the pumps,\" she said.\n\n\"And it wasn't the steam, but the fire,\" screamed Mrs. Assistant. \"Oh,\ndear, how that captain lied, and I thought him such a nice man, too.\nOh, I shall go into hysterics, I know I shall.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't if I were you,\" said the sensible Mrs. General, who was a\nstrong-minded woman; \"besides, it is too late. We're all safe now. I\nthink both captains were pretty sensible men. Evidently married, both\nof 'em.\"\n\nWhich was quite true.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DEPARTURE OF CUB MCLEAN.\n\n\nOf course no one will believe me when I say that Mellish was in every\nrespect, except one, an exemplary citizen and a good-hearted man. He\nwas generous to a fault and he gave many a young fellow a start in life\nwhere a little money or a few encouraging words were needed. He drank,\nof course, but he was a connoisseur in liquors, and a connoisseur never\ngoes in for excess. Few could tell a humorous story as well as Mellish,\nand he seldom dealt in chestnuts. No man can be wholly bad who never\ninflicts an old story on his friends, locating it on some acquaintance\nof his, and alleging that it occurred the day before.\n\nIf I wished to write a heart-rending article on the evils of gambling,\nMellish would be the man I would go to for my facts and for the moral\nof the tale. He spent his life persuading people not to gamble. He\nnever gambled himself, he said. But if no attention was paid to his\nadvice, why then he furnished gamblers with the most secluded and\nluxurious gambling rooms in the city. It was supposed that Mellish\nstood in with the police, which was, of course, a libel. The idea of\nthe guardians of the city standing in with a gambler or a gambling\nhouse! The statement was absurd on the face of it. If you asked any\npoliceman in the city where Mellish's gambling rooms were, you would\nspeedily learn that not one of them had ever even heard of the place.\nAll this goes to show how scandalously people will talk, and if\nMellish's rooms were free from raids, it was merely Mellish's good\nluck, that was all. Anyhow, in Mellish's rooms you could have a quiet,\ngentlemanly game for stakes about as high as you cared to go, and you\nwere reasonably sure there would be no fuss and that your name would\nnot appear in the papers next morning.\n\nOne night as Mellish cast his eye around his well-filled main room he\nnoticed a stranger sitting at the roulette table. Mellish had a keen\neye for strangers and in an unobtrusive way generally managed to find\nout something about them. A stranger in a gambling room brings in with\nhim a certain sense of danger to the habitu\u00e9s.\n\n\"Who is that boy?\" whispered Mellish to his bartender, generally known\nas Sotty, an ex-prize fighter and a dangerous man to handle if it came\nto trouble. It rarely came to trouble there, but Sotty was, in a\nmeasure, the silent symbol of physical force, backing the well-known\nmild morality of Mellish.\n\n\"I don't know him,\" answered Sotty.\n\n\"Whom did he come in with?\"\n\n\"I didn't see him come in. Hadn't noticed him till now.\"\n\nMellish looked at the boy for a few minutes. He had the fresh, healthy,\nsmooth face of a lad from the country, and he seemed strangely out of\nplace in the heated atmosphere of that room, under the glare of the\ngas. Mellish sighed as he looked at him, then he turned to Sotty and\nsaid:\n\n\"Just get him away quietly and bring him to the small poker room. I\nwant to have a few words with him.\"\n\nSotty, who had the utmost contempt for the humanitarian feelings of his\nboss, said nothing, but a look of disdain swept over his florid\nfeatures as he went on his mission. If he had his way, he would not\nthrow even a sprat out of the net. Many a time he had known Mellish to\npersuade a youngster with more money than brains to go home, giving\norders at the double doors that he was not to be admitted again.\n\nThe young man rose with a look of something like consternation on his\nface and followed Sotty. The thing was done quietly, and all those\naround the tables were too much absorbed in the game to pay much\nattention.\n\n\"Look here, my boy,\" said Mellish, when they were alone, \"who brought\nyou to this place?\"\n\n\"I guess,\" said the lad, with an expression of resentment, \"I'm old\nenough to go where I like without being brought.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly, certainly,\" said Mellish, diplomatically, knowing how\nmuch very young men dislike being accused of youth, \"but I like to know\nall visitors here. You couldn't get in unless you came with someone\nknown at the door. Who vouched for you?\"\n\n\"See here, Mr. Mellish,\" said the youth angrily, \"what are you driving\nat? If your doorkeepers don't know their own business why don't you\nspeak to them about it? Are you going to have me turned out?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort,\" said Mellish, soothingly, putting his hand in a\nfatherly manner on the young fellow's shoulder. \"Don't mistake my\nmeaning. The fact that you are here shows that you have a right to be\nhere. We'll say no more about that. But you take my advice and quit the\nbusiness here and now. I was a gambler before you were born, although I\ndon't gamble any more. Take the advice of a man who knows. It doesn't\npay.\"\n\n\"It seems to have paid you reasonably well.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't complain. It has its ups and downs like all businesses.\nStill, it doesn't pay me nearly as well as perhaps you think, and you\ncan take my word that in the long run it won't pay you at all. How much\nmoney have you got?\"\n\n\"Enough to pay if I lose,\" said the boy impudently; then seeing the\nlook of pain that passed over Mellish's face, he added more civilly:\n\n\"I have three or four hundred dollars.\"\n\n\"Well, take my advice and go home. You'll be just that much better off\nin the morning.\"\n\n\"What! Don't you play a square game here?\"\n\n\"Of course we play a square game here,\" answered Mellish with\nindignation. \"Do you think I am a card-sharper?\"\n\n\"You seem so cock-sure I'll lose my money that I was just wondering.\nNow, I can afford to lose all the money I've got and not feel it. Are\nyou going to allow me to play, or are you going to chuck me out?\"\n\n\"Oh, you can play if you want to. But don't come whining to me when you\nlose. I've warned you.\"\n\n\"I'm not a whiner,\" said the young fellow; \"I take my medicine like a\nman.\"\n\n\"Right you are,\" said Mellish with a sigh. He realized that this\nfellow, young as he looked, was probably deeper in vice than his\nappearance indicated and he knew the uselessness of counsel in such a\ncase. They went into the main room together and the boy, abandoning\nroulette, began to play at one of the card tables for ever-increasing\nstakes. Mellish kept an eye on him for a time. The boy was having the\nluck of most beginners. He played a reckless game and won hand over\nfist. As one man had enough and rose from the table another eagerly\ntook his place, but there was no break in the boy's winnings.\n\nPony Rowell was always late in arriving at the gambling rooms. On this\noccasion he entered, irreproachably dressed, and with the quiet,\ngentlemanly demeanor habitual with him. The professional gambler was\nnever known to lose his temper. When displeased he became quieter, if\npossible, than before. The only sign of inward anger was a mark like an\nold scar which extended from his right temple, beginning over the eye\nand disappearing in his closely-cropped hair behind the ear. This line\nbecame an angry red that stood out against the general pallor of his\nface when things were going in a way that did not please him. He spoke\nin a low tone to Mellish.\n\n\"What's the excitement down at the other end of the room? Every one\nseems congregated there.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" answered Mellish, \"it's a boy--a stranger--who is having the\ndevil's own luck at the start. It will be the ruin of him.\"\n\n\"Is he playing high?\"\n\n\"High? I should say so. He's perfectly reckless. He'll be brought up\nwith a sharp turn and will borrow money from me to get out of town.\nI've seen a flutter like that before.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Pony tranquilly, \"I must have a go at him. I like\nto tackle a youngster in the first flush of success, especially if he\nis plunging.\"\n\n\"You will soon have a chance,\" answered Mellish, \"for even Ragstock\nknows when he has enough. He will get up in a moment. I know the\nsigns.\"\n\nWith the air of a gentleman of leisure, somewhat tired of the\nfrivolities of this world, Rowell made his way slowly to the group. As\nhe looked over their shoulders at the boy a curious glitter came into\nhis piercing eyes, and his lips, usually so well under control,\ntightened. The red mark began to come out as his face paled. It was\nevident that he did not intend to speak and that he was about to move\naway again, but the magnetism of his keen glance seemed to disturb the\nplayer, who suddenly looked up over the head of his opponent and met\nthe stern gaze of Rowell.\n\nThe boy did three things. He placed his cards face downward on the\ntable, put his right hand over the pile of money, and moved his chair\nback.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" cried Ragstock.\n\nThe youth ignored the question, still keeping his eyes on Rowell.\n\n\"Do you squeal?\" he asked.\n\n\"I squeal,\" said Pony, whatever the question and answer might mean.\nThen Rowell cried, slightly raising his voice so that all might hear:\n\n\"This man is Cub McLean, the most notorious card-sharper, thief, and\nmurderer in the west. He couldn't play straight if he tried.\"\n\nMcLean laughed. \"Yes,\" he said; \"and if you want to see my trademark\nlook at the side of Greggs' face.\"\n\nEvery man looked at Pony, learning for the first time that he had gone\nunder a different name at some period of his life.\n\nDuring the momentary distraction McLean swept the money off the table\nand put it in his pockets.\n\n\"Hold on,\" cried Ragstock, seemingly not quite understanding the\nsituation. \"You haven't won that yet.\"\n\nAgain McLean laughed.\n\n\"It would have been the same in ten minutes.\"\n\nHe jumped up, scattering the crowd behind him.\n\n\"Look to the doors,\" cried Pony. \"Don't let this man out.\"\n\nMcLean had his back to the wall. From under his coat he whipped two\nrevolvers which he held out, one in each hand.\n\n\"You ought to know me better than that, Greggs,\" he said, \"do you want\nme to have another shot at you? I won't miss this time. Drop that.\"\n\nThe last command was given in a ringing voice that attracted every\none's attention to Sotty. He had picked up a revolver from somewhere\nbehind the bar and had come out with it in his hand. McLean's eye\nseemed to take in every motion in the room and he instantly covered the\nbartender with one of the pistols as he gave the command.\n\n\"Drop it,\" said Mellish. \"There must be no shooting. You may go\nquietly. No one will interfere with you.\"\n\n\"You bet your sweet life they won't,\" said McLean with a laugh.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" continued Mellish, \"the house will stand the loss. If I\nallow a swindler in my rooms it is but right that I alone should\nsuffer. Now you put up your guns and walk out.\"\n\n\"Good old Mellish,\" sneered McLean, \"you ought to be running a Sunday-\nschool.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the permission to depart McLean did not relax his\nprecautions for a moment. His shoulders scraped their way along the\nwall as he gradually worked towards the door. He kept Pony covered with\nhis left hand while the polished barrel of the revolver in his right\nseemed to have a roving commission all over the room, to the nervous\ndread of many respectable persons who cowered within range. When he\nreached the door he said to Pony:\n\n\"I hope you'll excuse me, Greggs, but this is too good an opportunity\nto miss. I'm going to kill you in your tracks.\"\n\n\"That's about your size,\" said Pony putting his hands behind him and\nstanding in his place, while those near him edged away. \"I'm unarmed,\nso it is perfectly safe. You will insure your arrest so blaze away.\"\n\n\"Dodge under the table, then, and I will spare you.\"\n\nPony invited him to take up his abode in tropical futurity.\n\nCub laughed once more good naturedly, and lowered the muzzle of his\nrevolver. As he shoved back his soft felt hat, Mellish, who stood\nnearest him, saw that the hair on his temples was grey. Lines of\nanxiety had come into his apparently youthful face as he had scraped\nhis way along the wall.\n\n\"Good-night, all,\" he shouted back from the stairway.\n\n\n\n\nOLD NUMBER EIGHTY-SIX.\n\n\nJohn Saggart stood in a dark corner of the terminus, out of the rays of\nthe glittering arc lamps, and watched engine Number Eighty-six. The\nengineer was oiling her, and the fireman, as he opened the furnace-door\nand shovelled in the coal, stood out like a red Rembrandt picture in\nthe cab against the darkness beyond. As the engineer with his oil can\nwent carefully around Number Eighty-six, John Saggart drew his sleeve\nacross his eyes, and a gulp came up his throat. He knew every joint and\nbolt in that contrary old engine--the most cantankerous iron brute on\nthe road--and yet, if rightly managed, one of the swiftest and most\npowerful machines the company had, notwithstanding the many\nimprovements that had been put upon locomotives since old Eighty-six\nhad left the foundry.\n\nSaggart, as he stood there, thought of the seven years he had spent on\nthe foot-board of old Eighty-six, and of the many tricks she had played\nhim during that period. If, as the poet says, the very chains and the\nprisoner become friends through long association, it may be imagined\nhow much of a man's affection goes out to a machine that he thoroughly\nunderstands and likes--a machine that is his daily companion for years,\nin danger and out of it. Number Eighty-six and John had been in many a\nclose pinch together, and at this moment the man seemed to have\nforgotten that often the pinch was caused by the pure cussedness of\nEighty-six herself, and he remembered only that she had bravely done\nher part several times when the situation was exceedingly serious.\n\nThe cry \"All aboard\" rang out and was echoed down from the high-arched\nroof of the great terminus, and John with a sigh turned from his\ncontemplation of the engine, and went to take his seat in the car. It\nwas a long train with many sleeping-cars at the end of it. The engineer\nhad put away his oil-can, and had taken his place on the engine,\nstanding ready to begin the long journey at the moment the signal was\ngiven.\n\nJohn Saggart climbed into the smoking-carriage at the front part of the\ntrain. He found a place in one of the forward seats, and sank down into\nit with a vague feeling of uneasiness at being inside the coach instead\nof on the engine. He gazed out of the window and saw the glittering\nelectric lights slide slowly behind, then, more quickly, the red,\ngreen, and white lights of the signal lamps, and finally there\nflickered swiftly past the brilliant constellation of city windows,\nshowing that the town had not yet gone to bed. At last the flying train\nplunged into the country, and Saggart pressed his face against the cold\nglass of the window, unable to shake off his feeling of responsibility,\nalthough he knew there was another man at the throttle.\n\nHe was aroused from his reverie by a touch on the shoulder, and a curt\nrequest, \"Tickets, please.\"\n\nHe pulled out of his pocket a pass, and turned to hand it to the\nconductor who stood there with a glittering, plated, and crystal\nlantern on his arm.\n\n\"Hello, John, is this you?\" cried the conductor, as soon as he saw the\nface. \"Hang it, man, you didn't need a pass in travelling with me.\"\n\n\"They gave it to me to take me home,\" said Saggart, a touch of sadness\nin his voice, \"and I may as well use it as not. I don't want to get you\ninto trouble.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'd risk the trouble,\" said the conductor, placing the lantern on\nthe floor and taking his seat beside the engineer. \"I heard about your\nworry to-day. It's too bad. If a man had got drunk at his post, as you\nand I have known 'em to do, it wouldn't have seemed so hard; but at its\nworst your case was only an error of judgment, and then nothing really\nhappened. Old Eighty-six seems to have the habit of pulling herself\nthrough. I suppose you and she have been in worse fixes than that,\nwith not a word said about it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said John, \"we've been in many a tight place together, but\nwe won't be any more. It's rough, as you say. I've been fifteen years\nwith the company, and seven on old Eighty-six, and at first it comes\nmighty hard. But I suppose I'll get used to it.\"\n\n\"Look here, John,\" said the conductor, lowering his voice to a\nconfidential tone, \"the president of the road is with us to-night; his\nprivate car is the last but one on the train. How would it do to speak\nto him? If you are afraid to tackle him, I'll put in a word for you in\na minute, and tell him your side of the story.\"\n\nJohn Saggart shook his head.\n\n\"It wouldn't do,\" he said; \"he wouldn't overrule what one of his\nsubordinates had done, unless there was serious injustice in the case.\nIt's the new manager, you know. There's always trouble with a new\nmanager. He sweeps clean. And I suppose that he thinks by 'bouncing'\none of the oldest engineers on the road, he will scare the rest.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't think much of him between ourselves,\" said the\nconductor. \"What do you think he has done to-night? He's put a new man\non Eighty-six. A man from one of the branch lines who doesn't know the\nroad. I doubt if he's ever been over the main line before. Now, it's an\nanxious enough time for me anyhow with a heavy train to take through,\nwith the thermometer at zero, and the rails like glass, and I like to\nhave a man in front that I can depend on.\"\n\n\"It's bad enough not to know the road,\" said John gloomily, \"but it's\nworse not to know old Eighty-six. She's a brute if she takes a notion.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose there is another engine that could draw this train and\nkeep her time,\" said the conductor.\n\n\"No! She'll do her work all right if you'll only humor her,\" admitted\nSaggart, who could not conceal his love for the engine even while he\nblamed her.\n\n\"Well,\" said the conductor, rising and picking up his lantern, \"the man\nin front may be all right, but I would feel safer if you were further\nahead than the smoker. I'm sorry I can't offer you a berth to-night,\nJohn, but we're full clear through to the rear lights. There isn't even\na vacant upper on the train.\"\n\n\"Oh, it doesn't matter,\" said Saggart. \"I couldn't sleep, anyhow. I'd\nrather sit here and look out of the window.\"\n\n\"Well, so long,\" said the conductor. \"I'll drop in and see you as the\nnight passes on.\"\n\nSaggart lit his pipe and gazed out into darkness. He knew every inch of\nthe road--all the up grades and the down grades and the levels. He knew\nit even better in the murkiest night than in the clearest day. Now and\nthen the black bulk of a barn or a clump of trees showed for one moment\nagainst the sky, and Saggart would say to himself, \"Now he should shut\noff an inch of steam,\" or, \"Now he should throw her wide open.\" The\ntrain made few stops, but he saw that they were losing time. Eighty-six\nwas sulking, very likely. Thinking of the engine turned his mind to his\nown fate. No man was of very much use in the world, after all, for the\nmoment he steps down another is ready to stand in his place. The wise\nmen in the city who had listened to his defence knew so well that an\nengine was merely a combination of iron and steel and brass, and that a\ngiven number of pounds of steam would get it over a given number of\nmiles in a given number of hours, and they had smiled incredulously\nwhen he told them that an engine had her tantrums, and informed them\nthat sometimes she had to be coddled up like any other female. Even\nwhen a man did his best there were occasions when nothing he could do\nwould mollify her, and then there was sure to be trouble, although, he\nadded, in his desire to be fair, she was always sorry for it afterward.\nWhich remark, to his confusion, had turned the smile into a laugh.\n\nHe wondered what Eighty-six thought of the new man. Not much,\nevidently, for she was losing time, which she had no business to do on\nthat section of the road. Still it might be the fault of the new man\nnot knowing when to push her for all she was worth and when to ease up.\nAll these things go to the making of time. But it was more than\nprobable that old Eighty-six, like Gilpin's horse, was wondering more\nand more what thing upon her back had got. \"He'll have trouble,\"\nmuttered John to himself, \"when she finds out.\"\n\nThe conductor came in again and sat down beside the engineer. He said\nnothing, but sat there sorting his tickets, while Saggart gazed out of\nthe window. Suddenly the engineer sprang to his feet with his eyes wide\nopen. The train was swaying from side to side and going at great speed.\n\nThe conductor looked up with a smile.\n\n\"Old Eighty-six,\" he said, \"is evidently going to make up for lost\ntime.\"\n\n\"She should be slowing down for crossing the G. & M. line,\" replied the\nengineer. \"Good heavens!\" he cried a moment after, \"we've gone across\nthe G. & M. track on the keen jump.\"\n\nThe conductor sprang to his feet. He knew the seriousness of such a\nthing. Even the fastest expresses must stop dead before crossing on the\nlevel the line of another railway. It is the law.\n\n\"Doesn't that fool in front know enough to stop at a crossing?\"\n\n\"It isn't that.\" said Saggart. \"He knows all right. Even the train boys\nknow that. Old Eighty-six has taken the bit between her teeth. He can't\nstop her. Where do you pass No. 6 to-night?\"\n\n\"At Pointsville.\"\n\n\"That's only six miles ahead,\" said the engineer; \"and in five minutes\nat this rate we will be running on her time and on her rails. She's\nalways late, and won't be on the side track. I must get to Eighty-six.\"\n\nSaggart quickly made his way through the baggage-coach, climbed on the\nexpress car, and jumped on the coal of the tender. He cast his eye up\nthe track and saw glimmering in the distance, like a faint wavering\nstar, the headlight of No. 6. Looking down into the cab he realized the\nsituation in a glance. The engineer, with fear in his face and beads of\nperspiration on his brow, was throwing his whole weight on the lever,\nthe fireman helping him. Saggart leaped down to the floor of the cab.\n\n\"Stand aside,\" he shouted; and there was such a ring of confident\ncommand in his voice that both men instantly obeyed.\n\nSaggart grasped the lever, and instead of trying to shut off steam\nflung it wide open. Number Eighty-six gave a quiver and a jump forward.\n\"You old fiend!\" muttered John between his teeth. Then he pushed the\nlever home, and it slid into place as if there had never been any\nimpediment. The steam was shut off, but the lights of Pointsville\nflashed past them with the empty side-track on the left, and they were\nnow flying along the single line of rails with the headlight of No. 6\ngrowing brighter and brighter in front of them.\n\n\"Reverse her, reverse her!\" cried the other engineer, with fear in his\nvoice.\n\n\"Reverse nothing,\" said Saggart. \"She'll slide ten miles if you do.\nJump, if you're afraid.\"\n\nThe man from the branch line promptly jumped.\n\n\"Save yourself,\" said Saggart to the stoker; \"there's bound to be a\nsmash.\"\n\n\"I'll stick by you, Mr. Saggart,\" said the fireman, who knew him. But\nhis hand trembled.\n\nThe air-brake was grinding the long train and sending a shiver of fear\nthrough every timber, but the rails were slippery with frost, and the\nspeed of the train seemed as great as ever. At the right moment Saggart\nreversed the engine, and the sparks flew up from her great drivers like\ncatharine wheels.\n\n\"Brace yourself,\" cried Saggart. \"No. 6 is backing up, thank God!\"\n\nNext instant the crash came. Two headlights and two cow-catchers went\nto flinders, and the two trains stood there with horns locked, but no\ngreat damage done, except a shaking up for a lot of panic-stricken\npassengers.\n\nThe burly engineer of No. 6 jumped down and came forward, his mouth\nfull of oaths.\n\n\"What the h--l do you mean by running in on our time like this? Hello,\nis that you, Saggart? I thought there was a new man on to-night. I\ndidn't expect this from _you_.\"\n\n\"It's all right, Billy. It wasn't the new man's fault. He's back in the\nditch with a broken leg, I should say, from the way he jumped. Old\nEighty-six is to blame. She got on the rampage. Took advantage of the\ngreenhorn.\"\n\nThe conductor came running up.\n\n\"How is it?\" he cried.\n\n\"It's all right. Number Eighty-six got her nose broke, and served her\nright, that's all. Tell the passengers there's no danger, and get 'em\non board. We're going to back up to Pointsville. Better send the\nbrakesmen to pick up the other engineer. The ground's hard tonight, and\nhe may be hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm going back to talk to the president,\" said the conductor\nemphatically. \"He's in a condition of mind to listen to reason, judging\nfrom the glimpse I got of his face at the door of his car a moment ago.\nEither he re-instates you or I go gathering tickets on a street-car.\nThis kind of thing is too exciting for my nerves.\"\n\nThe conductor's interview with the president of the road was apparently\nsatisfactory, for old Number Eighty-six is trying to lead a better life\nunder the guidance of John Saggart.\n\n\n\n\nPLAYING WITH MARKED CARDS.\n\n\n\"I'm bothered about that young fellow,\" said Mellish early one morning,\nto the professional gambler, Pony Rowell.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"He comes here night after night, and he loses more than he can afford,\nI imagine. He has no income, so far as I can find out, except what he\ngets as salary, and it takes a mighty sight bigger salary than his to\nstand the strain he's putting on it.\"\n\n\"What is his business?\"\n\n\"He is cashier in the Ninth National Bank. I don't know how much he\ngets, but it can't be enough to permit this sort of thing to go on.\"\n\nPony Rowell shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I don't think I would let it trouble me, if I were you, Mellish.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless it does. I have advised him to quit, but it is no use. If\nI tell the doorkeeper not to let him in here, he will merely go\nsomewhere else where they are not so particular.\"\n\n\"I must confess I don't quite understand you, Mellish, long as I have\nknown you. In your place, now, I would either give up keeping a\ngambling saloon or I would give up the moral reformation line of\nbusiness. I wouldn't try to ride two horses of such different tempers\nat the same time.\"\n\n\"I've never tried to reform you, Pony,\" said Mellish, with reproach in\nhis voice.\n\n\"No; I will give you credit for that much sense.\"\n\n\"It's all right with old stagers like you and me, Pony, but with a boy\njust beginning life, it is different. Now it struck me that you might\nbe able to help me in this.\"\n\n\"Yes, I thought that was what you were leading up to,\" said Rowell,\nthrusting his hands deep in his trousers' pockets. \"I'm no missionary,\nremember. What did you want me to do?\"\n\n\"I wanted you to give him a sharp lesson. Couldn't you mark a pack of\ncards and get him to play high? Then, when you have taken all his ready\nmoney and landed him in debt to you so that he can't move, give him\nback his cash if he promises not to gamble again.\"\n\nRowell looked across at the subject of their conversation. \"I don't\nthink I would flatter him so much as to even stock the cards on him.\nI'll clean him out if you like. But it won't do any good, Mellish. Look\nat his eyes. The insanity of gambling is in them. I used to think if I\nhad $100,000, I would quit. I'm old enough now to know that I wouldn't.\nI'd gamble if I had a million.\"\n\n\"I stopped after I was your age.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Mellish, you are the virtuous exception that proves the rule.\nYou quit gambling the way the old woman kept tavern,\" and Rowell cast a\nglance over the busy room.\n\nMellish smiled somewhat grimly, then he sighed. \"I wish I was out of\nit,\" he said. \"But, anyhow, you think over what I've been talking\nabout, and if you can see your way to giving him a sharp lesson I wish\nyou would.\"\n\n\"All right I will, but merely to ease your tender conscience, Mellish.\nIt's no use, I tell you. When the snake has bitten, the victim is\ndoomed. Gambling isn't a simple thing like the opium habit.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nReggie Forme, the bank cashier, rose at last from the roulette table.\nHe was flushed with success, for there was a considerable addition to\nthe sum he had in his pockets when he sat down. He flattered himself\nthat the result was due to the system he had elaborately studied out.\n\nNothing lures a man to destruction quicker than a system that can be\nmathematically demonstrated. It gives an air of business to gambling\nwhich is soothing to the conscience of a person brought up on\nstatistics. The system generally works beautifully at first; then a cog\nslips and you are mangled in the machinery before you know where you\nare. As young Forme left the table he felt a hand on his shoulder, and\nlooking around, met the impassive gaze of Pony Rowell.\n\n\"You're young at the business, I see,\" remarked the professional\nquietly.\n\n\"Why do you think that?\" asked the youngster, coloring, for one likes\nto be taken for a veteran, especially when one is an amateur.\n\n\"Because you fool away your time at roulette. That is a game for boys\nand women. Have you nerve enough to play a real game?\"\n\n\"What do you call a real game?\"\n\n\"A game with cards in a private room for something bigger than half-\ndollar points.\"\n\n\"How big?\"\n\n\"Depends on what capital you have. How much capital can you command?\"\n\nThe cashier hesitated for a moment and his eyes fell from the steady\nlight of Rowell's, which seemed to have an uncomfortable habit of\nlooking into one's inmost soul.\n\n\"I can bring $1,000 here on Saturday night.\"\n\n\"All right. That will do as a starter. Is it an appointment then?\"\n\n\"Yes, if you like. What time?\"\n\n\"I generally get here pretty late, but I can make an exception in your\ncase. What do you say to 10 o'clock?\"\n\n\"That will suit me.\"\n\n\"Very well, then. Don't fool away any of your money or nerve until I\ncome. You will need all you have of both.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe professional gambler and the amateur began their series of games a\nfew minutes after ten in a little private room. The young man became\nmore and more excited as the play went on. As for Pony, he was cool\nunder any circumstances. Before an hour had passed the $1,000 was\ntransferred from the possession of Forme into the pockets of the\nprofessional, and by midnight the younger man was another $1,000 in\nRowell's debt.\n\n\"It isn't my practice,\" said Rowell slowly, \"to play with a man unless\nhe has the money in sight. I've made an exception in your case, as luck\nwas against you, but I think this has gone far enough. You may bring me\nthe $1,000 you owe any day next week. No particular hurry, you know.\"\n\nThe young fellow appeared to be dazed. He drew his hand across his brow\nand then said mechanically, as if he had just heard his opponent's\nremark:\n\n\"No hurry? All right. Next week. Certainly. I guess I'll go home now.\"\n\nForme went out, leaving Rowell idly shuffling the cards at the small\ntable. The moment the young man had disappeared all Rowell's indolence\nvanished. He sprang up and put on his overcoat, then slipped out by the\nrear exit into the alley. He had made up his mind what Forme would do.\nMentally he tracked him from the gambling rooms to the river and he\neven went so far as to believe he would take certain streets on his way\nthither. A gambler is nothing if not superstitious and so Rowell was\nnot in the least surprised when he saw the young man emerge from the\ndark stairway, hesitate for a moment between the two directions open to\nhim, and finally choose the one that the gambler expected him to take.\nThe cold streets were deserted and so Rowell had more difficulty in\nfollowing his late victim unperceived than he would have had earlier in\nthe evening. Several times the older man thought the pursued had become\naware of the pursuit, for Forme stopped and looked around him; once\ncoming back and taking another street as if trying to double on the man\nwho was following him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRowell began to realize the difficulty of the task he had set for\nhimself, and as he had never had any faith in it anyhow, he began to\nfeel uncomfortable and to curse the tender heart of Mellish. If the\nyoungster got the idea into his head that he was followed he might\nsucceed in giving his pursuer the slip, and then Rowell would find\nhimself with the fool's death on his conscience, and what was to him\ninfinitely worse, with a thousand dollars in his pocket that had been\nunfairly won. This thought made him curse Mellish afresh. It had been\nentirely against his own will that he had played with marked cards, but\nMellish had insisted that they should take no chances, and the veteran\nknew too well the uncertainties of playing a fair game where a great\nobject lesson was to be taught. It would make them look like two fools,\nMellish had said, if Forme won the money. In answer to this Rowell had\nremarked that they were two fools anyhow, but he had finally succumbed\nto Mellish as the whole scheme was Mellish's. As Rowell thought\nbitterly of these things his attention was diverted from the very\nmatter he had in hand. Few men can pursue a course of thought and a\nfellow-creature at the same time. He suddenly realized that young Forme\nhad escaped him. Rowell stood alone in the dimly-lighted silent street\nand poured unuttered maledictions on his own stupidity. Suddenly a\nvoice rang out from a dark doorway.\n\n\"What the devil are you following me for?\"\n\n\"Oh, you're there, are you?\" said Pony calmly.\n\n\"I'm here. Now what do you want of me? Aren't you satisfied with what\nyou have done to-night?\"\n\n\"Naturally not, or I wouldn't be fool-chasing at such an hour as this.\"\n\n\"Then you admit you have been following me?\"\n\n\"I never denied it.\"\n\n\"What do you want of me? Do I belong to myself or do you think I belong\nto you, because I owe you some money?\"\n\n\"I do not know, I am sure, to whom you belong,\" said Rowell with his\nslow drawl. \"I suspect, however, that the city police, who seem to be\nscarce at this hour, have the first claim upon you. What do I want of\nyou? I want to ask you a question. Where did you get the money you\nplayed with to-night?\"\n\n\"It's none of your business.\"\n\n\"I presume not. But as there are no witnesses to this interesting\nconversation I will venture an opinion that you robbed the bank.\"\n\nThe young man took a step forward, but Pony stood his ground, using the\ninterval to light another cigarette.\n\n\"I will also venture an opinion, Mr. Rowell, and say that the money\ncame as honestly into my pocket as it did into yours.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't be saying much for it. I have the advantage of you,\nhowever, because the nine points are in my favor. I have possession.\"\n\n\"What are you following me for? To give me up?\"\n\n\"You admit the robbery, then.\"\n\n\"I admit nothing.\"\n\n\"It won't be used against you. As I told you, there are no witnesses.\nIt will pay you to be frank. Where did you get the money?\"\n\n\"Where many another man gets it. Out of the bank.\"\n\n\"I thought so. Now, Forme, you are not such a fool as you look--or act.\nYou know where all that sort of thing leads to. You haven't any chance.\nAll the rules of the game are against you. You have no more show than\nyou had against me to-night. Why not chuck it, before it is too late?\"\n\n\"It is easy for you to talk like that when you have my money in your\npocket.\"\n\n\"But that simply is another rule of the game. The money of a thief is\nbound to go into someone else's pocket. Whoever enjoys the cash\nultimately, he never does. Now if you had the money in your pocket what\nwould you do?\"\n\n\"I would go back to Mellish's and have another try.\"\n\n\"I believe you,\" said Rowell with, for the first time, some cordiality\nin his voice. He recognized a kindred spirit in this young man.\n\"Nevertheless it would be a foolish thing to do. You have two chances\nbefore you. You can become a sport as I am and spend your life in\ngambling rooms. Or you can become what is called a respectable business\nman. But you can't be both. In a very short time you will not have the\nchoice. You will be found out and then you can only be what I am--\nprobably not as successful as I have been. If you add bank robbery to\nyour other accomplishments then you will go to prison or, what is\nperhaps worse, to Canada. Which career are you going to choose?\"\n\n\"Come down to plain facts. What do you mean by all this talk? If I say\nI'll quit gambling do you mean that you will return to me the thousand\ndollars and call the other thousand square?\"\n\n\"If you give me your word of honor that you will quit.\"\n\n\"And if I don't, what then?\"\n\n\"Then on Monday I will hand over this money to the bank and advise them\nto look into your accounts.\"\n\n\"And suppose my accounts prove to be all right, what then?\"\n\nRowell shrugged his shoulders. \"In that remote possibility I will give\nthe thousand dollars to you and play you another game for it.\"\n\n\"I see. Which means that you cheated to-night.\"\n\n\"If you like to put it that way.\"\n\n\"And what if I denounced you as a self-confessed cheat?\"\n\n\"It wouldn't matter to me. I wouldn't take the trouble to deny it.\nNobody would believe you.\"\n\n\"You're a cool hand, Pony, I admire your cheek. Still, you've got some\nsilly elements in you.\"\n\n\"Oh, you mean my trying to reform you? Don't make any mistake about\nthat. It is Mellish's idea, not mine. I don't believe in you for a\nmoment.\"\n\nThe young man laughed. He reflected for a few seconds, then said: \"I'll\ntake your offer. You give me back the money and I will promise never to\ngamble again in any shape or form.\"\n\n\"You will return the cash to the bank, if you took it from there?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I will put it back the first thing on Monday morning.\"\n\n\"Then here is your pile,\" said Rowell, handing him the roll of bills.\n\nForme took it eagerly and, standing where the light struck down upon\nhim, counted the bills, while Rowell looked on silently with a cynical\nsmile on his lips.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the young man, \"you're a good fellow, Rowell.\"\n\n\"I'm obliged for your good opinion. I hope you found the money\ncorrect?\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" said Forme, flushing a little. \"I hope you did not mind\nmy counting it. Merely a business habit, you know.\"\n\n\"Well, stick to business habits, Mr. Forme. Good night.\"\n\nRowell walked briskly back to Mellish's. Forme walked toward the\nrailway station and found that there was a train for Chicago at 4 in\nthe morning. He had one clear day and part of another before he was\nmissed, and as it turned out all trace of him was lost in the big city.\nThe bank found about $6,000 missing. Two years after, news came that\nForme had been shot dead in a gambling hall in Southern Texas.\n\n\"We are two first-class fools,\" said Rowell to Mellish, \"and I for one\ndon't feel proud of the episode, so we'll say nothing more about it.\nThe gambling mania was in his blood. Gambling is not a vice; it is a\ndisease, latent in all of us.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE BRUISER'S COURTSHIP.\n\n\nWhile the Northern Bruiser sat in the chair in his corner and was being\nfanned he resolved to finish the fight at the next round. The superior\nskill of his opponent was telling upon him, and although the Bruiser\nwas a young man of immense strength, yet, up to that time, the\nalertness and dexterity of the Yorkshire Chicken had baffled him, and\nprevented him from landing one of his tremendous shoulder thrusts. But\neven though skill had checkmated strength up to this point, the Chicken\nhad not entirely succeeded in defending himself, and was in a condition\ndescribed by the yelling crowd as \"groggy.\"\n\nWhen time was called the Bruiser was speedily on his feet. His face did\nnot present the repulsive appearance so visible on the countenance of\nhis opponent, but the Bruiser had experience enough to know that the\nbody blows received in this fight had had their effect on his wind and\nstaying powers; and that although the Chicken presented an appalling\nappearance with his swollen lips and cheeks, and his eyes nearly\nclosed, yet he was in better trim for continuing the battle than the\nBruiser.\n\nThe Chicken came up to the mark less promptly than his big antagonist,\nbut whether it was from weakness or lack of sight, he seemed uncertain\nin his movements, and the hearts of his backers sank as they saw him\nstagger rather than walk to his place.\n\nBefore the Chicken, as it were, fully waked up to the situation, the\nBruiser lunged forward and planted a blow on his temple that would have\nbroken the guard of a man who was in better condition than the Chicken.\nThe Yorkshireman fell like a log, and lay where he fell. Then the\nBruiser got a lesson which terrified him. A sickly ashen hue came over\nthe purple face of the man on the ground. The Bruiser had expected some\ndefence, and the terrible blow had been even more powerful than he\nintended. A shivering whisper went round the crowd, \"He is killed,\" and\ninstantly the silenced mob quietly scattered. It was every man for\nhimself before the authorities took a hand in the game.\n\nThe Bruiser stood there swaying from side to side, his gaze fixed upon\nthe prostrate man. He saw himself indicted and hanged for murder, and\nhe swore that if the Chicken recovered he would never again enter the\nring. This was a phase of prize-fighting that he had never before had\nexperience of. On different occasions he had, it is true, knocked out\nhis various opponents, and once or twice he had been knocked out\nhimself; but the Chicken had fought so pluckily up to the last round\nthat the Bruiser had put forth more of his tremendous strength than he\nhad bargained for, and now the man's life hung on a thread.\n\nThe unconscious pugilist was carried to an adjoining room. Two\nphysicians were in attendance upon him, and at first the reports were\nmost gloomy, but towards daylight the Bruiser learned with relief that\nthe chances were in favor of his opponent.\n\nThe Bruiser had been urged to fly, but he was a man of strong common\nsense, and he thoroughly understood the futility of flight. His face\nand his form were too well known all around the country. It would have\nbeen impossible for him to escape, even if he had tried to do so.\n\nWhen the Yorkshire Chicken recovered, the Bruiser's friends laughed at\nhis resolve to quit the ring, but they could not shake it. The money he\nhad won in his last fight, together with what he had accumulated\nbefore--for he was a frugal man--was enough to keep him for the rest of\nhis days, and he resolved to return to the Border town where he was\nborn, and where doubtless his fame had preceded him.\n\nHe buckled his guineas in a belt around him, and with a stout stick in\nhis hand he left London for the North. He was a strong and healthy\nyoung man, and had not given way to dissipation, as so many\nprizefighters had done before, and will again. He had a horror of a\ncramped and confined, seat in a stage coach. He loved the free air of\nthe heights and the quiet stillness of the valleys.\n\nIt was in the days of highwaymen, and travelling by coach was not\nconsidered any too safe. The Bruiser was afraid of no man that lived,\nif he met him in the open with a stick in his hand, or with nature's\nweapons, but he feared the muzzle of a pistol held at his head in the\ndark by a man with a mask over his face. So he buckled his belt around\nhim with all his worldly gear in gold, took his own almost forgotten\nname, Abel Trenchon, set his back to the sun and his face to the north\nwind, and journeyed on foot along the king's highway. He stopped at\nnight in the wayside inns, taking up his quarters before the sun had\nset, and leaving them when it was broad daylight in the morning. He\ndisputed his reckonings like a man who must needs count the pennies,\nand no one suspected the sturdy wayfarer of carrying a fortune around\nhis body.\n\nAs his face turned toward the North his thought went to the Border town\nwhere he had spent his childhood. His father and mother were dead, and\nhe doubted now if anyone there remembered him, or would have a welcome\nfor him. Nevertheless no other spot on earth was so dear to him, and it\nhad always been his intention, when he settled down and took a wife, to\nretire to the quiet little town.\n\nThe weather, at least, gave him a surly welcome. On the last day's\ntramp the wind howled and the rain beat in gusts against him, but he\nwas a man who cared little for the tempest, and he bent his body to the\nblast, trudging sturdily on. It was evening when he began to recognize\nfamiliar objects by the wayside, and he was surprised to see how little\nchange there had been in all the years he was away. He stopped at an\ninn for supper, and, having refreshed himself, resolved to break the\nrule he had made for himself throughout the journey. He would push on\nthrough the night, and sleep in his native village.\n\nThe storm became more pitiless as he proceeded, and he found himself\nsympathizing with those poor creatures who were compelled to be out in\nit, but he never gave a thought to himself.\n\nIt was nearly midnight when he saw the square church tower standing\nblackly out against the dark sky; and when he began to descend the\nvalley, on the other side of which the town stood, a thrill of fear\ncame over him, as he remembered what he had so long forgotten--that the\nvalley was haunted, and was a particularly dangerous place about the\nhour of midnight. To divert his thoughts he then began to wonder who\nthe woman was he would marry. She was doubtless now sleeping calmly in\nthe village on the hill, quite unconscious of the approach of her lover\nand her husband. He could not conceal from himself the fact that he\nwould be reckoned a good match when his wealth was known, for,\nexcepting the Squire, he would probably be the richest man in the\nplace. However, he resolved to be silent about his riches, so that the\ngirl he married would little dream of the good fortune that awaited\nher. He laughed aloud as he thought of the pleasure he would have in\ntelling his wife of her luck, but the laugh died on his lips as he saw,\nor thought he saw, something moving stealthily along the hedge.\n\nHe was now in the depth of the valley in a most lonesome and eerie\nspot. The huge trees on each side formed an arch over the roadway and\npartially sheltered it from the rain.\n\nHe stood in his tracks, grasped his stick with firmer hold, and shouted\nvaliantly, \"Who goes there?\"\n\nThere was no answer, but in the silence which followed he thought he\nheard a woman's sob.\n\n\"Come out into the road,\" he cried, \"or I shall fire.\"\n\nHis own fear of pistols was so great that he expected everyone else to\nbe terrorized by the threat of using them; and yet he had never\npossessed nor carried a pistol in his life.\n\n\"Please--please don't fire,\" cried a trembling voice, from out the\ndarkness. \"I will do as you tell me.\" And so saying the figure moved\nout upon the road.\n\nTrenchon peered at her through the darkness, but whether she was old or\nyoung he could not tell. Her voice seemed to indicate that she was\nyoung.\n\n\"Why, lass,\" said Trenchon, kindly, \"what dost thou here at such an\nhour and in such a night?\"\n\n\"Alas!\" she cried, weeping; \"my father turned me out, as he has often\ndone before, but to-night is a bitter night, and I had nowhere to go,\nso I came here to be sheltered from the rain. He will be asleep ere\nlong, and he sleeps soundly. I may perhaps steal in by a window,\nalthough sometimes he fastens them down.\"\n\n\"God's truth!\" cried Trenchon, angrily. \"Who is thy brute of a father?\"\n\nThe girl hesitated, and then spoke as if to excuse him, but again\nTrenchon demanded his name.\n\n\"He is the blacksmith of the village, and Cameron is his name.\"\n\n\"I remember him,\" said Trenchon. \"Is thy mother, then, dead?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the girl, weeping afresh. \"She has been dead these five\nyears.\"\n\n\"I knew her when I was a boy,\" said Trenchon. \"Thy father also, and\nmany a grudge I owe him, although I had forgotten about them. Still, I\ndoubt not but as a boy I was as much in fault as he, although he was\nharsh to all of us, and now it seems he is harsh to thee. My name is\nTrenchon. I doubt if any in the village now remember me, although,\nperhaps, they may have heard of me from London,\" he said, with some\npride, and a hope that the girl would confirm his thoughts. But she\nshook her head.\n\n\"I have never heard thy name,\" she said.\n\nTrenchon sighed. This, then, was fame!\n\n\"Ah, well!\" he cried, \"that matters not; they shall hear more of me\nlater. I will go with thee to thy father's house and demand for thee\nadmittance and decent usage.\"\n\nBut the girl shrank back. \"Oh, no, no!\" she cried; \"that will never do.\nMy father is a hard man to cross. There are none in the village who\ndare contend with him.\"\n\n\"That is as it may be,\" said Trenchon, with easy confidence. \"I, for\none, fear him not. Come, lass, with me, and see if I cannot, after all\nthese years, pick out thy father's dwelling. Come, I say, thou must not\nlonger tarry here; the rain is coming on afresh, and these trees, thick\nas they are, form scant protection. It is outrageous that thou should\nwander in this storm, while thy brutal father lies in shelter. Nay, do\nnot fear harm for either thee or me; and as for him, he shall not\nsuffer if thou but wish it so.\" And, drawing the girl's hand through\nhis arm, he took her reluctantly with him, and without direction from\nher soon stood before the blacksmith's house.\n\n\"You see,\" he said, triumphantly, \"I knew the place, and yet I have not\nseen the town for years.\"\n\nTrenchon rapped soundly on the oaken door with his heavy stick, and the\nblows re-echoed through the silent house. The girl shrank timidly\nbehind him, and would have fled, but that he held her firmly by the\nwrist.\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" he said: \"believe me there is naught to fear. I will see\nthat thou art not ill-used.\"\n\nAs he spoke the window above was thrown up, and a string of fearful\noaths greeted the two, whereat the girl once more tried to release her\nimprisoned wrist, but Trenchon held it lightly, though with a grip like\nsteel.\n\nThe stout old man thrust his head through the open window.\n\n\"God's blight on thee!\" he cried, \"thou pair of fools who wish to wed\nso much that ye venture out in such a night as this. Well, have your\nway, and let me have my rest. In the name of the law of Scotland I\npronounce ye man and wife. There, that will bind two fools together as\nstrongly as if the Archbishop spoke the words. Place thou the money on\nthe steps. I warrant none will venture to touch it when it belongs to\nme.\" And with that he closed the window.\n\n\"Is he raving mad or drunk?\" cried Trenchon.\n\nThe girl gave a wailing cry. \"Alas! alas!\" she said; \"he is neither. He\nis so used to marrying folk who come from England across the Border\nthat he thinks not it his daughter who came with thee, but two who\nwished to wed. They come at all hours of the night and day, and he has\nmarried us. I am thy wife.\"\n\nThe astonished man dropped her wrist, and she put her hands before her\neyes and wept.\n\n\"Married!\" cried Trenchon. \"We two married!\"\n\nHe looked with interest at the girl, but in the darkness could see\nnothing of her. The unheeded rain pelted on them both.\n\n\"Hast thou\"--he hesitated--\"hast thou some other lover, since you\nweep?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head. \"No one,\" she said, \"comes near us. They fear\nmy father.\"\n\n\"Then, if this be true, why dost thou weep? I am not considered so bad\na fellow.\"\n\n\"I weep not for myself, but for thee, who through the kindness of thy\nheart hast been led into this trap. Believe me, it was not my\nintention.\"\n\n\"Judging from thy voice, my girl, and if thou favorest thy mother, as I\nthink, whom I remember well, this is a trap that I shall make little\neffort to get my foot out of. But thou art dripping, and I stand\nchattering here. Once more I will arouse my father-in-law.\"\n\nSo saying, he stoutly rapped again with his stick upon the door.\n\nOnce more the window was pushed up, and again the angry head appeared.\n\n\"Get you gone!\" cried the maddened blacksmith, but before he could say\nanything further Trenchon cried out:\n\n\"It is thy daughter here who waits. Open the door, thou limb of hell,\nor I will burst it in and cast thee out as thou hast done thy\ndaughter.\"\n\nThe blacksmith, who had never in his life been spoken to in tones or\nwords like these, was so amazed that he could neither speak nor act,\nbut one stout kick against the door so shook the fabric that he\nspeedily saw another such would break into his domicile; so, leaving\nthe window open that his curses might the better reach them, the\nblacksmith came down and threw the barrier from the door, flinging it\nopen and standing on the threshold so as to bar all ingress.\n\n\"Out of the way,\" cried Trenchon, roughly placing his hand on the\nother's breast with apparent lightness, but with a push that sent him\nstaggering into the room.\n\nThe young man pulled the girl in after him and closed the door.\n\n\"Thou knowest the way,\" he whispered. \"Strike thou a light.\"\n\nThe trembling girl lit a candle, and as it shone upon her face Trenchon\ngave a deep sigh of happiness and relief. No girl in the village could\nbe more fair.\n\nThe blacksmith stood, his fingers clenched with rage; but he looked\nwith hesitation and respect upon the burly form of the prizefighter.\nYet the old man did not flinch.\n\n\"Throw aside thy stick,\" he cried, \"or wait until I can get me another.\"\n\nTrenchon flung his stick into the corner.\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" cried the girl, clasping her hands. \"You must not fight.\" But\nshe appealed to her husband and not to her father, which caused a glow\nof satisfaction to rise from the heart of the young man.\n\n\"Get thee out of this house,\" cried her father, fiercely, turning upon\nher.\n\n\"Talk not thus to my wife,\" said Trenchon, advancing upon him.\n\n\"Thy wife?\" cried the blacksmith, in amaze.\n\n\"My wife,\" repeated the young man with emphasis. \"They tell me,\nblacksmith, that thou art strong. That thou art brutal I know, but thy\nstrength I doubt. Come to me and test it.\"\n\nThe old man sprang upon him, and the Bruiser caught him by the elbows\nand held him helpless as a child. He pressed him up against the wall,\npushed his wrists together, and clasped them both in his one gigantic\nhand. Then, placing the other on the blacksmith's shoulder, he put his\nweight upon him, and the blacksmith, cursing but helpless, sank upon\nhis knees.\n\n\"Now, thou hardened sinner,\" cried the Bruiser, bending over him. \"Beg\nfrom thy daughter on thy knees for a night's shelter in this house.\nBeg, or I will thrust thy craven face against the floor.\"\n\nThe girl clung to her newly-found husband, and entreated him not to\nhurt her father.\n\n\"I shall not hurt him if he do but speak. If he has naught but curses\non his lips, why then those lips must kiss the flags that are beneath\nhim. Speak out, blacksmith: what hast thou to say?\"\n\n\"I beg for shelter,\" said the conquered man.\n\nInstantly the Bruiser released him.\n\n\"Get thee to bed,\" he said, and the old man slunk away.\n\n\"Wife,\" said Abel Trenchon, opening his arms, \"I have come all the way\nfrom London for thee. I knew not then what drew me north, but now I\nknow that One wiser than me led my steps hither. As far as erring man\nmay promise I do promise thee that thou shalt ne'er regret being cast\nout this night into the storm.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE RAID ON MELLISH.\n\n\nSome newspapers differ from others. One peculiarity about the Argus was\nthe frequency with which it changed its men. Managing editors came who\nwere going to revolutionize the world and incidentally the Argus, but\nthey were in the habit of disappearing to give place to others who also\ndisappeared. Newspaper men in that part of the country never considered\nthemselves full-fledged unless they had had a turn at managing the\nArgus. If you asked who was at the head of the Argus the answer would\nvery likely be: \"Well, So-and-so was managing it this morning. I don't\nknow who is running it this afternoon.\"\n\nPerhaps the most weird period in the history of the Argus was when the\nowners imported a crank from Pittsburg and put him in as local editor,\nover the heads of the city staff. His name was McCrasky, christened\nAngus or Archie, I forget which, at this period of time. In fact, his\nChristian name was always a moot point; some of the reporters saying it\nwas Angus and others Archie, no one having the courage to ask him.\nAnyhow, he signed himself A. McCrasky. He was a good man, which was\nrather an oddity on the staff, and puzzled the reporters not a little.\nMost of his predecessors had differed much from each other, but they\nwere all alike in one thing, and that was profanity. They expressed\ndisapproval in language that made the hardened printers' towel in the\ncomposing room shrink.\n\nMcCrasky's great point was that the local pages of the paper should\nhave a strong moral influence on the community. He knocked the sporting\neditor speechless by telling him that they would have no more reports\nof prize-fights. Poor Murren went back to the local room, sat down at\nhis table and buried his head in his hands. Every man on a local staff\nnaturally thinks the paper is published mainly to give his department a\nshow, and Murren considered a fight to a finish as being of more real\nimportance to the world than a presidential election. The rest of the\nboys tried to cheer him up. \"A fine state of things,\" said Murren\nbitterly. \"Think of the scrap next week between the California Duffer\nand Pigeon Billy and no report of it in the Argus! Imagine the walk-\nover for the other papers. What in thunder does he think people want to\nread?\"\n\nBut there was another surprise in store for the boys. McCrasky\nassembled them all in his room and held forth to them. He suddenly\nsprung a question on the criminal reporter--so suddenly that Thompson,\ntaken unawares, almost spoke the truth.\n\n\"Do you know of any gambling houses in this city?\"\n\nThompson caught his breath and glanced quickly at Murren.\n\n\"No,\" he said at last. \"I don't, but perhaps the religious editor does.\nBetter ask him.\"\n\nThe religious editor smiled and removed his corn-cob pipe.\n\n\"There aren't any,\" he said. \"Didn't you know it was against the law to\nkeep a gambling house in this state? Yes, sir!\" Then he put his corn-\ncob pipe back in its place.\n\nMcCrasky was pleased to see that his young men knew so little of the\nwickedness of a great city; nevertheless he was there to give them some\ninformation, so he said quietly:\n\n\"Certainly it is against the law; but many things that are against the\nlaw flourish in a city like this. Now I want you to find out before the\nweek is past how many gambling houses there are and where they are\nlocated. When you are sure of your facts we will organize a raid and\nthe news will very likely be exclusive, for it will be late at night\nand the other papers may not hear of it.\"\n\n\"Suppose,\" said the religious editor, with a twinkle in his eye, as he\nagain removed his corn-cob, \"that--assuming such places to exist--you\nfound some representatives of the other papers there? They are a bad\nlot, the fellows on the other papers.\"\n\n\"If they are there,\" said the local editor, \"they will go to prison.\"\n\n\"They won't mind that, if they can write something about it,\" said\nMurren gloomily. In his opinion the Argus was going to the dogs.\n\n\"Now, Thompson,\" said McCrasky, \"you as criminal reporter must know a\nlot of men who can give you particulars for a first-rate article on the\nevils of gambling. Get it ready for Saturday's paper--a column and a\nhalf, with scare heads. We must work up public opinion.\"\n\nWhen the boys got back into the local room again, Murren sat with his\nhead in his hands, while Thompson leaned back in his chair and laughed.\n\n\"Work up public opinion,\" he said. \"Mac had better work up his own\nknowledge of the city streets, and not put Bolder avenue in the East\nEnd, as he did this morning.\"\n\nThe religious editor was helping himself to tobacco from Murren's\ndrawer. \"Are you going to put Mellish on his guard?\" he asked Thompson.\n\n\"I don't just know what I'm going to do,\" said Thompson; \"are you?\"\n\n\"I'll think about it,\" replied the R. E. \"Beastly poor tobacco, this of\nyours, Murren. Why don't you buy cut plug?\"\n\n\"You're not compelled to smoke it,\" said the sporting editor, without\nraising his head.\n\n\"I am when mine is out, and the other fellows keep their drawers\nlocked.\"\n\nThompson dropped in on Mellish, the keeper of the swell gambling rooms,\nto consult with him on the article for Saturday's paper. Mellish took a\ngreat interest in it, and thought it would do good. He willingly gave\nThompson several instances where the vice had led to ruin of promising\nyoung men.\n\n\"All men gamble in some way or another,\" said Mellish meditatively.\n\"Some take it one way and some another. It is inherent in human nature,\nlike original sin. The beginning of every business is a gamble. If I\nhad $30,000 I would rather run my chance of doubling it at these tables\nhere than I would, for instance, by starting a new newspaper or putting\nit on wheat or in railway stocks. Take a land boom, for instance, such\nas there was in California or at Winnipeg--the difference between\nputting your money in a thing like that or going in for legitimate\ngambling is that, in the one case, you are sure to lose your cash,\nwhile in the other you have a chance of winning some. I hold that all\nkinds of gambling are bad, unless a man can easily afford to lose what\nhe stakes. The trouble is that gambling affects some people like\nliquor. I knew a man once who----\" but you can read the whole article if\nyou turn up the back numbers of the Argus.\n\nThompson told Mellish about McCrasky. Mellish was much interested, and\nsaid he would like to meet the local editor. He thought the papers\nshould take more interest in the suppression of gambling dens than they\ndid, and for his part he said he would like to see them all stopped,\nhis own included. \"Of course,\" he added, \"I could shut up my shop, but\nit would simply mean that someone else would open another, and I don't\nthink any man ever ran such a place fairer than I do.\"\n\nMcCrasky called on the chief of police, and introduced himself as the\nlocal editor of the Argus.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the chief, \"has Gorman gone, then?\"\n\n\"I don't know about Gorman,\" said McCrasky; \"the man I succeeded was\nFinnigan. I believe he is in Cincinnati now.\"\n\nWhen the chief learned the purport of the local editor's visit he\nbecame very official and somewhat taciturn. He presumed that there were\ngambling houses in the city. If there were, they were very quiet and no\ncomplaints ever reached his ears. There were many things, he said, that\nit was impossible to suppress, and the result of attempted suppression\nwas to drive the evil deeper down. He seemed to be in favor rather of\nregulating, than of attempting the impossible; still, if McCrasky\nbrought him undoubted evidence that a gambling house was in operation,\nhe would consider it his duty to make a raid on it. He advised McCrasky\nto go very cautiously about it, as the gamblers had doubtless many\nfriends who would give a tip and so frustrate a raid, perhaps letting\nsomebody in for damages. McCrasky said he would be careful.\n\nChance played into the hands of McCrasky and \"blew in\" on him a man who\nlittle recked what he was doing when he entered the local editor's\nroom. Gus Hammerly, sport and man-about-town, dropped into the Argus\noffice late one night to bring news of an \"event\" to the sporting\neditor. He knew his way about in the office, and, finding Murren was\nnot in, he left the item on his table. Then he wandered into the local\neditor's room. The newspaper boys all liked Hammerly, and many a good\nitem they got from him. They never gave him away, and he saw that they\nnever got left, as the vernacular is.\n\n\"Good-evening. You're the new local editor, I take it. I've just left a\nlittle item for Murren, I suppose he's not in from the wrestle yet. My\nname's Hammerly. All the boys know me and I've known in my time\nfourteen of your predecessors, so I may as well know you. You're from\nPittsburg, I hear.\"\n\n\"Yes. Sit down, Mr. Hammerly. Do you know Pittsburg at all?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. Borden, who keeps the gambling den on X street, is an old\nfriend of mine. Do you happen to know how old Borden's getting along?\"\n\n\"Yes, his place was raided and closed up by the police.\"\n\n\"That's just the old man's luck. Same thing in Kansas City.\"\n\n\"By the way, Mr. Hammerly, do you know of any gambling houses in this\ncity?\"\n\n\"Why, bless you, haven't the boys taken you round yet? Well, now,\nthat's inhospitable. Mellish's is the best place in town. I'm going up\nthere now. If you come along with me I'll give you the knock-down at\nthe door and you'll have no trouble after that.\"\n\n\"I'll go with you,\" said McCrasky, reaching for his hat, and so the\ninnocent Hammerly led the lamb into the lion's den.\n\nMcCrasky, unaccustomed to the sight, was somewhat bewildered with the\nrapidity of the play. There was a sort of semicircular table, around\nthe outside rim of which were sitting as many men as could be\ncomfortably placed there. A man at the inside of the table handled the\ncards. He flicked out one to each player, face downward, with an\nexpertness and speed that dazzled McCrasky. Next he dealt out one to\neach player face upward and people put sums of money on the table\nbeside their cards, after looking at them. There was another deal and\nso on, but the stranger found it impossible to understand or follow the\ngame. He saw money being raked in and paid out rapidly and over the\nwhole affair was a solemn decorum that he had not been prepared for. He\nhad expected fierce oaths and the drawing of revolvers.\n\n\"Here, Mellish,\" said the innocent Hammerly, \"let me introduce you to\nthe new local editor of the Argus. I didn't catch your name,\" he said\nin a whisper.\n\n\"My name's McCrasky.\"\n\n\"Mr. McCrasky; Mr. Mellish. Mellish is proprietor here and you'll find\nhim a first-rate fellow.\"\n\n\"I am pleased to meet you,\" said Mellish quietly; \"any friend of\nHammerly's is welcome. Make yourself at home.\"\n\nEdging away from the two, Mellish said in a quick whisper to Sotty, the\nbartender: \"Go and tell the doorkeeper to warn Thompson, or any of the\nrest of the Argus boys, that their boss is in here.\"\n\nAt 12 o'clock that night the local editor sat in his room. \"Is that\nyou, Thompson?\" he shouted, as he heard a step.\n\n\"Yes, sir;\" answered Thompson, coming into the presence.\n\n\"Shut the door, Thompson. Now I have a big thing on for to-night, but\nit must be done quietly. I've unearthed a gambling den in full blast.\nIt will be raided to-night at 2 o'clock. I want you to be on the ground\nwith Murren; will you need anybody else?\"\n\n\"Depends on how much you wish to make of it.\"\n\n\"I want to make it the feature of to-morrow's paper. I think we three\ncan manage, but bring some of the rest if you like. The place is run by\na man named Mellish. Now, if you boys kept your eyes open you would\nknow more of what is going on in your own city than you do.\"\n\n\"We haven't all had the advantage of metropolitan training,\" said\nThompson humbly.\n\n\"I will go there with the police. You and Murren had better be on the\nground, but don't go too soon, and don't make yourselves conspicuous or\nthey might take alarm. Here is the address. You had better take it\ndown.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll find the place all----\" Then Thompson thought a moment and\npulled himself together. \"Thanks,\" he said, carefully noting down the\nstreet and number.\n\nThe detachment of police drew up in front of the place a few minutes\nbefore 2 o'clock. The streets were deserted, and so silent were the\nblue coats that the footsteps of a belated wayfarer sounded sharply in\nthe night air from the stone pavement of a distant avenue.\n\n\"Are you sure,\" said McCrasky to the man in charge of the police, \"that\nthere is not a private entrance somewhere?\"\n\n\"Certainly there is,\" was the impatient reply: \"Sergeant McCollum and\nfour men are stationed in the alley behind. We know our business, sir.\"\n\nMcCrasky thought this was a snub, and he was right. He looked around in\nthe darkness for his reporters. He found them standing together in a\ndoorway on the opposite side of the street.\n\n\"Been here long?\" he whispered.\n\nMurren was gloomy and did not answer. The religious editor removed his\ncorn-cob and said briefly; \"About ten minutes, sir.\" Thompson was\ngazing with interest at the dark building across the way.\n\n\"You've seen nobody come out?\"\n\n\"Nobody. On the contrary, about half a dozen have gone up that\nstairway.\"\n\n\"Is that the place, sir?\" asked Thompson with the lamb-like innocence\nof the criminal reporter.\n\n\"Yes, upstairs there.\"\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" said the religious editor. \"Thompson insisted it\nwas next door.\"\n\n\"Come along,\" said McCrasky, \"the police are moving at last.\"\n\nA big bell in the neighborhood solemnly struck two slow strokes, and\nall over the city the hour sounded in various degrees of tone and\nspeed. A whistle rang out and was distantly answered. The police moved\nquickly and quietly up the stairway.\n\n\"Have you tickets, gentlemen,\" asked the man at the door politely;\n\"this is a private assembly.\"\n\n\"The police,\" said the sergeant shortly, \"stand aside.\"\n\nIf the police were astonished at the sight which met their gaze, their\nfaces did not show it. But McCrasky had not such control over his\nfeatures and he looked dumbfounded. The room was the same, undoubtedly,\nbut there was not the vestige of a card to be seen. There were no\ntables, and even the bar had disappeared. The chairs were nicely\narranged and most of them were occupied. At the further end of the room\nPony Rowell stood on a platform or on a box or some elevation, and his\npale, earnest face was lighted up with the enthusiasm of the public\nspeaker. He was saying: \"On the purity of the ballot, gentlemen,\ndepends the very life of the republic. That every man should be\npermitted, without interference or intimidation, to cast his vote, and\nthat every vote so cast should be honestly counted is, I take it, the\ndesire of all who now listen to my words.\" (Great applause, during\nwhich Pony took a sip from a glass that may have contained water.)\n\nThe police had come in so quietly that no one, apparently, had noticed\ntheir entrance, except that good man Mellish, who hurried forward to\nwelcome the intruders.\n\n\"Will you take a seat?\" he asked. \"We are having a little political\ntalk from Mr. Rowell, sergeant.\"\n\n\"Rather an unusual hour, Mr. Mellish,\" said the sergeant grimly.\n\n\"It is a little late,\" admitted Mellish, as if the idea had not\noccurred to him before.\n\nThe police who had come in by the back entrance appeared at the other\nend of the room and it was evident that Rowell's oration had come to an\nuntimely end. Pony looked grieved and hurt, but said nothing.\n\n\"We will have to search the premises, Mr. Mellish,\" said the sergeant.\n\nMellish gave them every assistance, but nothing was found.\n\nAs the four men walked back together to the Argus office, McCrasky was\nvery indignant.\n\n\"We will expose the police to-morrow,\" he said. \"They evidently gave\nMellish the tip.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" said Thompson. \"We will say nothing about it.\"\n\n\"You forget yourself, Mr. Thompson. It rests with me to say what\nshall go on the local page. Not with you.\"\n\n\"I don't forget myself,\" answered Thompson sadly; \"I've just remembered\nmyself. The Directors of the Argus appointed me local editor yesterday.\nDidn't they tell you about it? That's just like them. They forgot to\nmention the fact to Corbin that he had been superseded and the\nmanager went off fishing after appointing Jonsey local editor, so\nthat for a week we had two local editors, each one countermanding\nthe orders of the other. It was an awful week. You remember it,\nMurren?\" Murren's groan seemed to indicate that his recollection of\nthe exciting time was not a pleasant memory.\n\n\"In case of doubt,\" murmured the religious editor, this time without\nremoving his corn-cob, \"obey the orders of the new man where the\nArgus is concerned. Thompson, old man, I'm wid you. When did the\nblow fall?\"\n\n\"Yesterday afternoon,\" said Thompson, almost with a sob; \"I'll be\ndismissed within a month, so I am rather sorry. I liked working\non the Argus--as a reporter. I never looked for such ill luck\nas promotion. But we all have our troubles, haven't we, Mac?\"\n\nMcCrasky did not answer. He is now connected with some paper\nin Texas.\n\n\n\n\nSTRIKING BACK.\n\n\nGeorge Streeter was in Paris, because he hoped and expected to meet\nAlfred Davison there. He knew that Davison was going to be in Paris for\nat least a fortnight, and he had a particular reason for wishing to\ncome across him in the streets of that city rather than in the streets\nof London.\n\nStreeter was a young author who had published several books, and who\nwas getting along as well as could be expected, until suddenly he met a\ncheck. The check was only a check as far as his own self-esteem was\nconcerned; for it did not in the least retard the sale of his latest\nbook, but rather appeared to increase it. The check was unexpected, for\nwhere he had looked for a caress, he received a blow. The blow was so\nwell placed, and so vigorous, that at first it stunned him. Then he\nbecame unreasonably angry. He resolved to strike back.\n\nThe review of his book in the Argus was vigorously severe, and perhaps\nwhat maddened him more than anything else was the fact that, in spite\nof his self-esteem he realized the truth of the criticism. If his books\nhad been less successful, or if he had been newer as an author, he\nmight possibly have set himself out to profit by the keen thrusts given\nhim by the Argus. He might have remembered that although Tennyson\nstruck back at Christopher North, calling him rusty, crusty, and musty,\nyet the poet eliminated from later editions all blemishes which musty\nChristopher had pointed out.\n\nStreeter resolved to strike back with something more tangible than a\nsarcastic verse. He quite admitted, even to himself, that a critic had\nevery right to criticise--that was what he was for--but he claimed that\na man who pretended to be an author's friend and who praised his books\nto his face, had no right to go behind his back and pen a criticism so\nscathing as that which appeared in the Argus: for Streeter knew that\nAlfred Davison had written the criticism in the Argus, and Davison had\nposed as his friend; and had pretended as well, that he had a great\nadmiration for Streeter's books.\n\nAs Streeter walked down the Boulevard des Italians, he saw, seated in\nfront of a caf\u00e9, the man whom he hoped to meet: and furthermore, he was\npleased to see that the man had a friend with him. The recognition of\nauthor and critic was mutual.\n\n\"Hallo, Streeter,\" cried Davison; \"when did you come over?\"\n\n\"I left London yesterday,\" answered Streeter.\n\n\"Then sit down and have something with us,\" said Davison, cordially.\n\"Streeter, this is my friend Harmon. He is an exile and a resident in\nParis, and, consequently, likes to meet his countrymen.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Streeter, \"he is probably well acquainted with the\ncustoms of the place?\"\n\n\"Rather!\" returned Davison; \"he has become so much of a Frenchman--he\nhas been so contaminated, if I may put it that way--that I believe\nquite recently he was either principal or second in a duel. By the way,\nwhich was it, Harmon?\"\n\n\"Merely a second,\" answered the other.\n\n\"I don't believe in duelling myself,\" continued Davison: \"it seems to\nme an idiotic custom, and so futile.\"\n\n\"I don't agree with you,\" replied Streeter, curtly; \"there is no reason\nwhy a duel should be futile, and there seem to be many reasons why a\nduel might be fought. There are many things, worse than crimes, which\nexist in all countries, and for which there is no remedy except calling\na man out; misdemeanors, if I may so term them, that the law takes no\ncognisance of; treachery, for instance;--a person pretending to be a\nman's friend, and then the first chance he gets, stabbing him in the\nback.\"\n\nHarmon nodded his approval of these sentiments, while Davison said\njauntily:\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about that! It seems to me these things, which I\nsuppose undoubtedly exist, should not be made important by taking much\nnotice of them. What will you have to drink, Streeter?\"\n\n\"Bring me a liqueur of brandy,\" said Streeter to the gar\u00e7on who stood\nready to take the order.\n\nWhen the waiter returned with a small glass, into which he poured the\nbrandy with the deftness of a Frenchman, filling it so that not a drop\nmore could be added, and yet without allowing the glass to overflow,\nStreeter pulled out his purse.\n\n\"No, no!\" cried Davison; \"you are not going to pay for this--you are\ndrinking with me.\"\n\n\"I pay for my own drinks,\" said Streeter, surlily.\n\n\"Not when I invite you to drink with me,\" protested the critic. \"I pay\nfor this brandy.\"\n\n\"Very well, take it, then!\" said Streeter, picking up the little glass\nand dashing the contents in the face of Davison.\n\nDavison took out his handkerchief.\n\n\"What the devil do you mean by that, Streeter?\" he asked, as the color\nmounted to his brow.\n\nStreeter took out his card and pencilled a word or two on the\npasteboard.\n\n\"There,\" he said, \"is my Paris address. If you do not know what I mean\nby that, ask your friend here; he will inform you.\"\n\nAnd with that the novelist arose, bowed to the two, and departed.\n\nWhen he returned to his hotel, after a stroll along the brilliantly-\nlighted Boulevards, he found waiting for him Mr. Harmon and a\nFrenchman.\n\n\"I had no idea you would come so soon,\" said Streeter, \"otherwise I\nwould not have kept you waiting.\"\n\n\"It does not matter,\" replied Harmon; \"we have not waited long. Affairs\nof this kind require prompt action. An insult lasts but twenty-four\nhours, and my friend and principal has no desire to put you to the\ninconvenience of repeating your action of this evening. We are taking\nit for granted that you have a friend prepared to act for you; for your\nconduct appeared to be premeditated.\"\n\n\"You are quite right,\" answered Streeter; \"I have two friends to whom I\nshall be pleased to introduce you. Come this way, if you will be so\nkind.\"\n\nThe preliminaries were speedily arranged, and the meeting was to take\nplace next morning at daylight, with pistols.\n\nNow that everything was settled, the prospect did not look quite so\npleasant to Streeter as it had done when he left London. Davison had\nasked for no explanation; but that, of course, could be accounted for,\nbecause this critical sneak must be well aware of the reason for the\ninsult. Still, Streeter had rather expected that he would perhaps have\nsimulated ignorance, and on receiving enlightenment might have avoided\na meeting to apologizing.\n\nAnyhow, Streeter resolved to make a night of it. He left his friends to\narrange for a carriage, and see to all that was necessary, while he\ndonned his war-paint and departed for a gathering to which he had been\ninvited, and where he was to meet many of his countrymen and\ncountrywomen, in a fashionable part of Paris.\n\nHis hostess appeared to be overjoyed at seeing him.\n\n\"You are so late,\" she said, \"that I was afraid something had occurred\nto keep you from coming altogether.\"\n\n\"Nothing could have prevented me from coming,\" said Streeter,\ngallantly, \"where Mrs. Woodford is hostess!\"\n\n\"Oh, that is very nice of you, Mr. Streeter!\" answered the lady; \"but I\nmust not stand here talking with you, for I have promised to introduce\nyou to Miss Neville, who wishes very much to meet you. She is a great\nadmirer of yours, and has read all your books.\"\n\n\"There are not very many of them,\" said Streeter, with a laugh; \"and\nsuch as they are, I hope Miss Neville thinks more of them than I do\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Oh, we all know how modest authors are!\" replied his hostess, leading\nhim away to be introduced.\n\nMiss Neville was young and pretty, and she was evidently pleased to\nmeet the rising young author.\n\n\"I have long wanted to see you,\" she said, \"to have a talk with you\nabout your books.\"\n\n\"You are very kind,\" said Streeter, \"but perhaps we might choose\nsomething more profitable to talk about?\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that. Doubtless you have been accustomed to hear\nonly the nice things people say about you. That is the misfortune of\nmany authors.\"\n\n\"It is a misfortune,\" answered Streeter.\n\n\"What a writer needs is somebody to tell him the truth.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Miss Neville, \"that is another thing I am not so sure about.\nMrs. Woodford has told you, I suppose, that I have read all your books?\nDid she add that I detested them?\"\n\nEven Streeter was not able to conceal the fact that this remark caused\nhim some surprise. He laughed uneasily, and said:\n\n\"On the contrary, Mrs. Woodford led me to believe that you had liked\nthem.\"\n\nThe girl leaned back in her chair, and looked at him with half-closed\neyes.\n\n\"Of course,\" she said, \"Mrs. Woodford does not know. It is not likely\nthat I would tell her I detested your books while I asked for an\nintroduction to you. She took it for granted that I meant to say\npleasant things to you, whereas I had made up my mind to do the exact\nreverse. No one would be more shocked than Mrs. Woodford--unless,\nperhaps, it is yourself--if she knew I was going to speak frankly with\nyou.\"\n\n\"I am not shocked,\" said the young man, seriously; \"I recognize that\nthere are many things in my books that are blemishes.\"\n\n\"Of course you don't mean that,\" said the frank young woman; \"because\nif you did you would not repeat the faults in book after book.\"\n\n\"A man can but do his best,\" said Streeter, getting annoyed in spite of\nhimself, for no man takes kindly to the candid friend. \"A man can but\ndo his best, as Hubert said, whose grandsire drew a longbow at\nHastings.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Miss Neville, \"a man can but do his best, although we\nshould remember that the man who said that, said it just before he was\ndefeated. What I feel is that you are not doing your best, and that you\nwill not do your best until some objectionable person like myself has a\ngood serious talk with you.\"\n\n\"Begin the serious talk,\" said Streeter; \"I am ready and eager to\nlisten.\"\n\n\"Did you read the review of your latest book which appeared in the\nArgus?\"\n\n\"Did I?\" said Streeter, somewhat startled--the thought of the meeting\nthat was so close, which he had forgotten for the moment, flashing over\nhim. \"Yes, I did; and I had the pleasure of meeting the person who\nwrote it this evening.\"\n\nMiss Neville almost jumped in her chair.\n\n\"Oh, I did not intend you to know that!\" she said. \"Who told you? How\ndid you find out that I wrote reviews for the Argus?\"\n\n\"You!\" cried Streeter, astonished in his turn. \"Do you mean to say that\nyou wrote that review?\"\n\nMiss Neville sank back in her chair with a sigh.\n\n\"There!\" she said, \"my impetuosity has, as the Americans say, given me\naway. After all, you did not know I was the writer!\"\n\n\"I thought Davison was the writer. I had it on the very best\nauthority.\"\n\n\"Poor Davison!\" said Miss Neville, laughing, \"why, he is one of the\nbest and staunchest friends you have: and so am I, for that matter--\nindeed, I am even more your friend than Mr. Davison; for I think you\n_can_ do good work, while Mr. Davison is foolish enough to believe you\nare doing it.\"\n\nAt this point in the conversation Streeter looked hurriedly at his\nwatch.\n\n\"Ah! I see,\" said Miss Neville; \"this conversation is not to your\ntaste. You are going to plead an appointment--as if anyone could have\nan appointment at this hour in the morning!\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Streeter, \"I have; and I must bid you good-bye.\nBut I assure you that my eyes have been opened, and that I have learned\na lesson to-night which I will not soon forget. I hope I may have the\npleasure of meeting you again, and continuing this conversation.\nPerhaps some time I may tell you why I have to leave.\"\n\nStreeter found his friends waiting for him. He knew it was no use\ntrying to see Davison before the meeting. There was a long drive ahead\nof them, and it was grey daylight when they reached the ground, where\nthey found the other party waiting.\n\nEach man took his place and the pistol that was handed to him. When the\nword \"Fire!\" was given, Streeter dropped his hand to his side. Davison\nstood with his pistol still pointed, but he did not fire.\n\n\"Why don't you shoot, George?\" said Davison.\n\nHarmon, at this point, rebuked his principal, and said he must have no\ncommunication with the other except through a second.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Davison, impatiently, \"I don't pretend to know the rules of\nthis idiotic game!\"\n\nStreeter stepped forward.\n\n\"I merely wished to give you the opportunity of firing at me if you\ncared to do so,\" he said; \"and now I desire to apologize for my action\nat the caf\u00e9. I may say that what I did was done under a\nmisapprehension. Anything that I can do to make reparation I am willing\nto do.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right!\" said Davison; \"nothing more need be said. I am\nperfectly satisfied. Let us get back to the city; I find it somewhat\nchilly out here.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said Harmon, with a sigh, \"Englishmen have the cheek to talk\nof the futility of French duels!\"\n\n\n\n\nCRANDALL'S CHOICE.\n\n\nJohn Crandall sat at his office desk and thought the situation over.\nEverybody had gone and he was in the office alone. Crandall was rather\ntired and a little sleepy, so he was inclined to take a gloomy view of\nthings. Not that there was anything wrong with his business; in fact,\nit was in a first-rate condition so far as it went, but it did not go\nfar enough; that was what John thought as he brooded over his affairs.\nHe was making money, of course, but the trouble was that he was not\nmaking it fast enough.\n\nAs he thought of these things John gradually and imperceptibly went to\nsleep, and while he slept he dreamt a dream. It would be quite easy to\npretend that the two persons who came to him in the vision, actually\nentered the office and that he thought them regular customers or\nsomething of that sort, while at the end of the story, when everybody\nwas bewildered, the whole matter might be explained by announcing the\nfact that it was all a dream, but this account being a true and honest\none, no such artifice will be used and at the very beginning the\nadmission is made that John was the victim of a vision.\n\nIn this dream two very beautiful ladies approached him. One was richly\ndressed and wore the most dazzling jewelry. The other was clad in plain\nattire. At first, the dreaming Mr. Crandall thought, or dreamt he\nthought, that the richly dressed one was the prettier. She was\ncertainly very attractive, but, as she came closer, John imagined that\nmuch of her beauty was artificial. He said to himself that she painted\nartistically perhaps, but at any rate she laid it on rather thick.\n\nAbout the other there was no question. She was a beauty, and what\nloveliness she possessed was due to the bounties of Providence and not\nto the assistance of the chemist. She was the first to speak.\n\n\"Mr. Crandall,\" she said, in the sweetest of voices, \"we have come here\ntogether so that you may choose between us. Which one will you have?\"\n\n\"Bless me,\" said Crandall, so much surprised at the unblushing proposal\nthat he nearly awoke himself, \"bless me, don't you know that I am\nmarried?\"\n\n\"Oh, _that_ doesn't matter,\" answered the fair young lady, with\nthe divinest of smiles.\n\n\"Doesn't it?\" said Mr. Crandall. \"If you had the pleasure of meeting\nMrs. Crandall I think you would find that it did--very much indeed.\"\n\n\"But we are not mortals; we are spirits.\"\n\n\"Oh, are you? Well, of course that makes a difference,\" replied Mr.\nCrandall much relieved, for he began to fear from the turn the\nconversation had taken that he was in the presence of two writers of\nmodern novels.\n\n\"This lady,\" continued the first speaker, \"is the spirit of wealth. If\nyou choose her you will be a very rich man before you die.\"\n\n\"Oh, ho!\" cried Crandall. \"Are you sure of that?\"\n\n\"Quite certain.\"\n\n\"Well, then I won't be long making my choice. I choose her, of course.\"\n\n\"But you don't know who I am. Perhaps when you know, you may wish to\nreverse your decision.\"\n\n\"I suppose you are the spirit of power or of fame or something of that\nsort. I am not an ambitious person; money is good enough for me.\"\n\n\"No, I am the spirit of health. Think well before you make your choice.\nMany have rejected me, and afterwards, have offered all their\npossessions fruitlessly, hoping to lure me to them.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Mr. Crandall, with some hesitation. \"You are a very pleasant\nyoung person to have around the house. But why cannot I have both of\nyou? How does _that_ strike you?\"\n\n\"I am very sorry, but I am not permitted to give you the choice of\nboth.\"\n\n\"Why is that? Many people are allowed to choose both.\"\n\n\"I know that; still we must follow our instructions.\"\n\n\"Well, if that is the case, without wishing to offend you in the least,\nI think I will stand by my first choice. I choose wealth.\"\n\nAs he said this the other lady advanced toward him and smiled somewhat\ntriumphantly as she held out her hand. Crandall grasped it and the\nfirst spirit sighed. Just as the spirit of wealth seemed about to\nspeak, there was a shake at the office door, and Mr. John Crandall saw\nthe spirits fade away. He rubbed his eyes and said to himself: \"By\nGeorge! I have been asleep. What a remarkably vivid dream that was.\"\n\nAs he yawned and stretched his arms above his head, the impatient\nrattle at the door told him that at least was not a part of the dream.\n\nHe arose and unlocked the door.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Bullion,\" he said, as that solid man came in. \"You're late,\naren't you.\"\n\n\"Why, for that matter, so are you. You must have been absorbed in your\naccounts or you would have heard me sooner. I thought I would have to\nshake the place down.\"\n\n\"Well, you know, the policeman sometimes tries the door and I thought\nat first it was he. Won't you sit down?\"\n\n\"Thanks! Don't care if I do. Busy tonight?\"\n\n\"Just got through.\"\n\n\"Well, how are things going?\"\n\n\"Oh, slowly as usual. Slowly because we have not facilities enough, but\nwe've got all the work we can do.\"\n\n\"Does it pay you for what work you do?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I'm not in this business as a philanthropist, you know.\"\n\n\"No. I didn't suppose you were. Now, see here, Crandall, I think you\nhave a good thing of it here and one of the enterprises that if\nextended would develop into a big business.\"\n\n\"I know it. But what am I to do? I've practically no capital to enlarge\nthe business, and I don't care to mortgage what I have and pay a high\nrate of interest when, just at the critical moment, we might have a\ncommercial crisis and I would then lose everything.\"\n\n\"Quite right; quite right, and a safe principle. Well, that's what I\ncame to see you about. I have had my eye on you and this factory for\nsome time. Now, if you want capital I will furnish it on the condition\nthat an accountant of mine examines the books and finds everything\npromising a fair return for enlarging the business. Of course I take\nyour word for the state of affairs all right enough, but business is\nbusiness, you know, and besides I want to get an expert opinion on how\nmuch enlargement it will stand. I suppose you could manage a\nmanufactory ten or twenty times larger as easily as you do this one.\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said Mr. Crandall.\n\n\"Then what do you say to my coming round to-morrow at 9 with my man?\"\n\n\"That would suit me all right.\"\n\nMr. John Crandall walked home a very much elated man that night.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"Well, doctor,\" said the patient in a very weak voice, \"what is the\nverdict!\"\n\n\"It is just as I said before. You will have to take a rest. You know I\npredicted this breakdown.\"\n\n\"Can't you give me something that will fix me up temporarily? It is\nalmost imperative that I should stay on just now.\"\n\n\"Of course it is. It has been so for the last five years. You forget\nthat in that time you have been fixed up temporarily on several\noccasions. Now, I will get you 'round so that you can travel in a few\ndays and then I insist on a sea voyage or a quiet time somewhere on the\ncontinent. You will have to throw off business cares entirely. There\nare no ifs or buts about it.\"\n\n\"Look here, doctor. I don't see how I am to leave at this time. I have\nbeen as bad as this a dozen times before. _You_ know that. I'm\njust a little fagged out and when I go back to the office I can take\nthings easier. You see, we have a big South American contract on hand\nthat I am very anxious about. New business, you know.\"\n\n\"I suppose you could draw your cheque for a pretty large amount, Mr.\nCrandall.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can. If money can bridge the thing over, I will arrange it.\"\n\n\"Well, money can't. What I wanted to say was that if, instead of having\na large sum in the bank, you had overdrawn your account about as much\nas the bank would stand, would you be surprised if your cheque were not\nhonored?\"\n\n\"No, I wouldn't.\"\n\n\"Well, that is your state physically. You've overdrawn your vitality\naccount. You've got to make a deposit. You must take a vacation.\"\n\n\"Any other time, doctor. I'll go sure, as soon as this contract is off.\nUpon my word I will. You needn't shake your head. A vacation just now\nwould only aggravate the difficulty. I wouldn't have a moment's peace\nknowing this South American business might be bungled. I'd worry myself\nto death.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThe funeral of Mr. Crandall was certainly one of the most splendid\nspectacles the city had seen for many a day. The papers all spoke\nhighly of the qualities of the dead manufacturer, whose growth had been\ntypical of the growth of the city. The eloquent minister spoke of the\ninscrutable ways of Providence in cutting off a man in his prime, and\nin the very height of his usefulness.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FAILURE OF BRADLEY.\n\n\n                 The skater lightly laughs and glides,\n                   Unknowing that beneath the ice\n                   On which he carves his fair device\n                 A stiffened corpse in silence glides.\n\n                 It glareth upward at his play;\n                   Its cold, blue, rigid fingers steal\n                   Beneath the tracings of his heel.\n                 It floats along and floats away.\n\n                                       --Unknown Poem.\n\n\n\"If I only had the courage,\" said Bradley, as he looked over the stone\nparapet of the embankment at the dark waters of the Thames as they\nflashed for a moment under the glitter of the gaslight and then\ndisappeared in the black night to flash again farther down.\n\n\"Very likely I would struggle to get out again the moment I went over,\"\nhe muttered to himself. \"But if no help came it would all be done with,\nin a minute. Two minutes perhaps. I'll warrant those two minutes would\nseem an eternity. I would see a hundred ways of making a living, if I\ncould only get out again. Why can't I see one now while I _am_ out. My\nfather committed suicide, why shouldn't I? I suppose it runs in the\nfamily. There seems to come a time when it is the only way out. I\nwonder if he hesitated? I'm a coward, that's the trouble.\"\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation the man slowly climbed on the top of the\nstone wall and then paused again. He looked with a shudder at the\ngloomy river.\n\n\"I'll do it,\" he cried aloud, and was about to slide down, when a hand\ngrasped his arm and a voice said:\n\n\"_What_ will you do?\"\n\nIn the light of the gas-lamp Bradley saw a man whose face seemed\nfamiliar and although he thought rapidly, \"Where have I seen that man\nbefore?\" he could not place him.\n\n\"Nothing,\" answered Bradley sullenly.\n\n\"That's right,\" was the answer. \"I'd do nothing of that kind, if I were\nyou.\"\n\n\"Of course you wouldn't. You have everything that I haven't--food,\nclothes, shelter. Certainly you wouldn't. Why should you?\"\n\n\"Why should you, if it comes to that?\"\n\n\"Because ten shillings stands between me and a job. That's why, if you\nwant to know. There's eight shillings railway fare, a shilling for\nsomething to eat to-night and a shilling for something in the morning.\nBut I haven't the ten shillings. So that's why.\"\n\n\"If I give you the ten shillings what assurance have I that you will\nnot go and get drunk on it?\"\n\n\"None at all. I have not asked you for ten shillings, nor for one. I\nhave simply answered your question.\"\n\n\"That is true. I will give you a pound if you will take it, and so if\nunfortunately you spent half of it in cheering yourself, you will still\nhave enough left to get that job. What is the job?\"\n\n\"I am a carpenter.\"\n\n\"You are welcome to the pound.\"\n\n\"I will take it gladly. But, mind you, I am not a beggar. I will take\nit if you give me your address, so that I may send it back to you when\nI earn it.\"\n\nBy this time Bradley had come down on the pavement. The other man\nlaughed quietly.\n\n\"I cannot agree to that. You are welcome to the money. More if you\nlike. I merely doubled the sum you mentioned to provide for anything\nunseen.\"\n\n\"Unless you let me return it, I will not take the money.\"\n\n\"I have perfect confidence in your honesty. If I had not, I would not\noffer the money. I cannot give you my address, or, rather, I will not.\nIf you will pay the pound to some charity or will give it to someone\nwho is in need, I am more than satisfied. If you give it to the right\nman and tell him to do the same, the pound will do more good than ever\nit will in my pocket or in my usual way of spending it.\"\n\n\"But how are you to know I will do that?\"\n\n\"I am considered rather a good judge of men. I am certain you will do\nwhat you say.\"\n\n\"I'll take the money. I doubt if there is anyone in London to-night who\nneeds it much worse than I do.\"\n\nBradley looked after the disappearing figure of the man who had\nbefriended him.\n\n\"I have seen that man somewhere before,\" he said to himself. But in\nthat he was wrong. He hadn't.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nWealth is most unevenly and most unfairly divided. All of us admit\nthat, but few of us agree about the remedy. Some of the best minds of\nthe century have wrestled with this question in vain. \"The poor ye have\nalways with you\" is as true to-day as it was 1800 years ago. Where so\nmany are in doubt, it is perhaps a comfort to meet men who have no\nuncertainty as to the cause and the remedy. Such a body of men met in a\nback room off Soho Square.\n\n\"We are waiting for you, Bradley,\" said the chairman, as the carpenter\ntook his place and the doors were locked. He looked better than he had\ndone a year before on the Thames embankment.\n\n\"I know I'm late, but I couldn't help it. They are rushing things at\nthe exhibition grounds. The time is short now, and they are beginning\nto be anxious for fear everything will not be ready in time.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said one of the small group, \"we are slaves and must be\nlate or early as our so-called masters choose.\"\n\n\"Oh, there is extra pay,\" said Bradley with a smile, as he took a seat.\n\n\"Comrades,\" said the chairman, rapping on the desk, \"we will now\nproceed to business. The secret committee has met and made a\nresolution. After the lots are drawn it will be my task to inform the\nman chosen what the job is. It is desirable that as few as possible,\neven among ourselves, should know who the man is, who has drawn the\nmarked paper. Perhaps it may be my own good fortune to be the chosen\nman. One of the papers is marked with a cross. Whoever draws that paper\nis to communicate with me at my room within two days. He is to come\nalone. It is commanded by the committee that no man is to look at his\npaper until he leaves this room and then to examine it in secret. He is\nbound by his oath to tell no one at any time whether or not he is the\nchosen man.\"\n\nThe papers were put into a hat and each man in the room drew one. The\nchairman put his in his pocket, as did the others. The doors were\nunlocked and each man went to his home, if he had one.\n\nNext evening Bradley called at the room of the chairman and said:\n\"There is the marked paper I drew last night.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThe exhibition building was gay with bunting and was sonorous with the\nsounds of a band of music. The machinery that would not stop for six\nmonths was still motionless, for it was to be started in an hour's time\nby His Highness. His Highness and suite had not yet arrived but the\nbuilding was crowded by a well-dressed throng of invited guests--the\nbest in the land as far as fame, title or money was concerned.\nUnderneath the grand stand where His Highness and the distinguished\nguests were to make speeches and where the finger of nobility was to\npress the electric button, Bradley walked anxiously about, with the\nsame haggard look on his face that was there the night he thought of\nslipping into the Thames. The place underneath was a wilderness of\nbeams and braces. Bradley's wooden tool chest stood on the ground\nagainst one of the timbers. The foremen came through and struck a beam\nor a brace here and there.\n\n\"Everything is all right,\" he said to Bradley. \"There will be no\ntrouble, even if it was put up in a hurry, and in spite of the strain\nthat will be on it to-day.\"\n\nBradley was not so sure of that, but he said nothing. When the foreman\nleft him alone, he cautiously opened the lid of his tool chest and\nremoved the carpenter's apron which covered something in the bottom.\nThis something was a small box with a clockwork arrangement and a\nminiature uplifted hammer that hung like the sword of Damocles over a\nlittle copper cap. He threw the apron over it again, closed the lid of\nthe chest, leaned against one of the timbers, folded his arms and\nwaited.\n\nPresently there was a tremendous cheer and the band struck up. \"He is\ncoming,\" said Bradley to himself, closing his lips tighter.\n\"Carpenter,\" cried the policeman putting in his head through the little\nwooden door at the foot of the stage, \"come here, quick. You can get a\nsplendid sight of His Highness as he comes up the passage.\" Bradley\nwalked to the opening and gazed at the distinguished procession coming\ntoward him. Suddenly he grasped the arm of the policeman like a vice.\n\n\"Who is that man in the robes--at the head of the procession?\"\n\n\"Don't you know? That is His Highness.\"\n\nBradley gasped for breath. He recognized His Highness as the man he had\nmet on the embankment.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said to the policeman, who looked at him curiously.\nThen he went under the grand stand among the beams and braces and\nleaned against one of the timbers with knitted brows.\n\nAfter a few moments he stepped to his chest, pulled off the apron and\ncarefully lifted out the machine. With a quick jerk he wrenched off the\nlittle hammer and flung it from him. The machinery inside whirred for a\nmoment with a soft purr like a clock running down. He opened the box\nand shook out into his apron a substance like damp sawdust. He seemed\npuzzled for a moment what to do with it. Finally he took it out and\nscattered it along the grass-grown slope of a railway cutting. Then he\nreturned to his tool chest, took out a chisel and grimly felt its edge\nwith his thumb.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nIt was admitted on all hands that His Highness never made a better\nspeech in his life than on the occasion of the opening of that\nexhibition. He touched lightly on the country's unexampled prosperity,\nof which the marvelous collection within those walls was an indication.\nHe alluded to the general contentment that reigned among the classes to\nwhose handiwork was due the splendid examples of human skill there\nexhibited. His Highness was thankful that peace and contentment reigned\nover the happy land and he hoped they would long continue so to reign.\nThen there were a good many light touches of humor in the discourse--\ntouches that are so pleasing when they come from people in high places.\nIn fact, the chairman said at the club afterwards (confidentially, of\ncourse) that the man who wrote His Highness's speeches had in that case\nquite outdone himself.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThe papers had very full accounts of the opening of the exhibition next\nmorning, and perhaps because these graphic articles occupied so much\nspace, there was so little room for the announcement about the man who\ncommitted suicide. The papers did not say where the body was found,\nexcept that it was near the exhibition buildings, and His Highness\nnever knew that he made that excellent speech directly over the body of\na dead man.\n\n\n\n\nRINGAMY'S CONVERT.\n\n\nMr. Johnson Ringamy, the author, sat in his library gazing idly out of\nthe window. The view was very pleasant, and the early morning sun\nbrought out in strong relief the fresh greenness of the trees that now\nhad on their early spring suits of foliage. Mr. Ringamy had been a busy\nman, but now, if he cared to take life easy, he might do so, for few\nbooks had had the tremendous success of his latest work. Mr. Ringamy\nwas thinking about this, when the door opened, and a tall,\nintellectual-looking young man entered from the study that communicated\nwith the library. He placed on the table the bunch of letters he had in\nhis hand, and, drawing up a chair, opened a blank notebook that had,\nbetween the leaves, a lead pencil sharpened at both ends.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Scriver,\" said the author, also hitching up his\nchair towards the table. He sighed as he did so, for the fair spring\nprospect from the library window was much more attractive than the task\nof answering an extensive correspondence.\n\n\"Is there a large mail this morning, Scriver?\"\n\n\"A good-sized one, sir. Many of them, however, are notes asking for\nyour autograph.\"\n\n\"Enclose stamps, do they?\"\n\n\"Most of them, sir; those that did not, I threw in the waste basket.\"\n\n\"Quite right. And as to the autographs you might write them this\nafternoon, if you have time.\"\n\n\"I have already done so, sir. I flatter myself that even your most\nintimate friend could not tell my version of your autograph from your\nown.\"\n\nAs he said this, the young man shoved towards the author a letter which\nhe had written, and Mr. Ringamy looked at it critically.\n\n\"Very good, Scriver, very good indeed. In fact, if I were put in the\nwitness-box I am not sure that I would be able to swear that this was\nnot my signature. What's this you have said in the body of the letter\nabout sentiment? Not making me write anything sentimental, I hope. Be\ncareful, my boy, I don't want the newspapers to get hold of anything\nthat they could turn into ridicule. They are too apt to do that sort of\nthing if they get half a chance.\"\n\n\"Oh, I think you will find that all right,\" said the young man; \"still\nI thought it best to submit it to you before sending it off. You see\nthe lady who writes has been getting up a 'Ringamy Club' in Kalamazoo,\nand she asks you to give her an autographic sentiment which they will\ncherish as the motto of the club. So I wrote the sentence, 'All classes\nof labor should have equal compensation.' If that won't do, I can\neasily change it.'\n\n\"Oh, that will do first rate--first rate.\"\n\n\"Of course it is awful rot, but I thought it would please the feminine\nmind.\"\n\n\"Awful _what_ did you say, Mr. Scriver?\"\n\n\"Well, slush--if that expresses it better. Of course, you don't believe\nany such nonsense.\"\n\nMr. Johnson Ringamy frowned as he looked at his secretary.\n\n\"I don't think I understand you,\" he said, at last.\n\n\"Well, look here, Mr. Ringamy, speaking now, not as a paid servant to\nhis master, but----\"\n\n\"Now, Scriver, I won't have any talk like that. There is no master or\nservant idea between us. There oughtn't to be between anybody. All men\nare free and equal.\"\n\n\"They are in theory, and in my eye, as I might say if I wanted to make\nit more expressive.\"\n\n\"Scriver, I cannot congratulate you on your expressive language, if I\nmay call it so. But we are wandering from the argument. You were going\nto say that speaking as----Well, go on.\"\n\n\"I was going to say that, speaking as one reasonably sensible man to\nanother, without any gammon about it; don't you think it is rank\nnonsense to hold that one class of labor should be as well compensated\nas another. Honestly now?\"\n\nThe author sat back in his chair and gazed across the table at his\nsecretary. Finally, he said:\n\n\"My dear Scriver, you can't really mean what you say. You know that I\nhold that all classes of labor should have exactly the same\ncompensation. The miner, the blacksmith, the preacher, the postal\nclerk, the author, the publisher, the printer--yes, the man who sweeps\nout the office, or who polishes boots, should each share alike, if this\nworld were what it should be--yes, and what it _will_ be. Why,\nScriver, you surely couldn't have read my book----\"\n\n\"Read it? why, hang it, I _wrote_ it.\"\n\n\"You wrote it? The deuce you did! I always thought I was the author of\n----\"\n\n\"So you are. But didn't I take it all down in shorthand, and didn't I\nwhack it out on the type-writer, and didn't I go over the proof sheets\nwith you. And yet you ask me if I have read it!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, quite right, I see what you mean. Well, if you paid as much\nattention to the arguments as you did to the mechanical production of\nthe book, I should think you would not ask if I really meant what I\nsaid.\"\n\n\"Oh, I suppose you meant it all right enough--in a way--in theory,\nperhaps, but----\"\n\n\"My dear sir, allow me to say that a theory which is not practical, is\nsimply no theory at all. The great success of 'Gazing Upward,' has been\ndue to the fact that it is an eminently practical work. The\nnationalization of everything is not a matter of theory. The ideas\nadvocated in that book, can be seen at work at any time. Look at the\nArmy, look at the Post Office.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right, looking at things in bulk. Let us come down to\npractical details. Detail is the real test of any scheme. Take this\nvolume, 'Gazing Upward.' Now, may I ask how much this book has netted\nyou up to date?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know exactly. Somewhere in the neighborhood of \u00a320,000.\"\n\n\"Very well then. Now let us look for a moment at the method by which\nthat book was produced. You walked up and down this room with your\nhands behind your back, and dictated chapter after chapter, and I sat\nat this table taking it all down in shorthand. Then you went out and\ntook the air while I industriously whacked it out on the type-writer.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't say 'whacked,' Scriver. That's twice you've used\nit.\"\n\n\"All right:--typographical error--For 'whacked' read 'manipulated.'\nThen you looked over the type-written pages, and I erased and wrote in\nand finally got out a perfect copy. Now I worked as hard--probably\nharder--than you did, yet the success of that book was entirely due to\nyou, and not to me. Therefore it is quite right that you should get\n\u00a320,000 and that I should get two pounds a week. Come now, isn't it?\nSpeaking as a man of common sense.\"\n\n\"Speaking exactly in that way I say no it is not right. If the world\nwere properly ruled the compensation of author and secretary would have\nbeen exactly the same.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, if you go so far as that,\" replied the Secretary, \"I have\nnothing more to say.\"\n\nThe author laughed, and the two men bent their energies to the\ncorrespondence. When the task was finished, Scriver said:\n\n\"I would like to get a couple of days off, Mr. Ringamy. I have some\nprivate business to attend to.\"\n\n\"When could you get back?\"\n\n\"I'll report to you on Thursday morning.\"\n\n\"Very well, then. Not later than Thursday. I think I'll take a couple\nof days off myself.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nOn Thursday morning Mr. Johnson Ringamy sat in his library looking out\nof the window, but the day was not as pleasant as when he last gazed at\nthe hills, and the woods, and green fields. A wild spring storm lashed\nthe landscape, and rattled the raindrops against the pane. Mr. Ringamy\nwaited for some time and then opened the study door and looked in. The\nlittle room was empty. He rang the bell, and the trim servant-girl\nappeared.\n\n\"Has Mr. Scriver come in yet?\"\n\n\"No, sir, he haven't.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the rain has kept him.\"\n\n\"Mr. Scriver said that when you come back, sir, there was a letter on\nthe table as was for you.\"\n\n\"Ah, so there is. Thank you, that will do.\"\n\nThe author opened the letter and read as follows:\n\n\"MY DEAR MR. RINGAMY,--Your arguments the other day fully convinced me\nthat you were right, and I was wrong (\"Ah! I thought they would,\"\nmurmured the author). I have therefore taken a step toward putting your\ntheories into practice. The scheme is an old one in commercial life,\nbut new in its present application, so much so that I fear it will find\nno defenders except yourself, and I trust that now when I am far away\n(\"Dear me, what does this mean!\" cried the author) you will show any\ndoubters that I acted on the principles which will govern the world\nwhen the theories of 'Gazing Upward' are put into practice. For fear\nthat all might not agree with you at present, I have taken the\nprecaution of going to that undiscovered country, from whose bourne no\nextradition treaty forces the traveler to return--sunny Spain. You said\nyou could not tell my rendition of your signature from your own.\nNeither could the bank cashier. My exact mutation of your signature has\nenabled me to withdraw \u00a310,000 from your bank account. Half the\nprofits, you know. You can send future accumulations, for the book will\ncontinue to sell, to the address of\n                                     \"ADAM SCRIVER.\n_\"Poste Restant, Madrid, Spain\"_\n\n\nMr. Ringamy at once put the case in the hands of the detectives, where\nit still remains.\n\n\n\n\nA SLIPPERY CUSTOMER.\n\n\nWhen John Armstrong stepped off the train at the Union Station, in\nToronto, Canada, and walked outside, a small boy accosted him.\n\n\"Carry your valise up for you, sir?\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" said Mr. Armstrong.\n\n\"Carry it up for ten cents, sir?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Take it up for five cents, sir?\"\n\n\"Get out of my way, will you?\"\n\nThe boy got out of the way, and John Armstrong carried the valise\nhimself.\n\nThere was nearly half a million dollars in it, so Mr. Armstrong thought\nit best to be his own porter.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nIn the bay window of one of the handsomest residences in Rochester, New\nYork, sat Miss Alma Temple, waiting for her father to come home from\nthe bank. Mr. Horace Temple was one of the solid men of Rochester, and\nwas president of the Temple National Bank. Although still early in\nDecember, the winter promised to be one of the most severe for many\nyears, and the snow lay crisp and hard on the streets, but not enough\nfor sleighing. It was too cold for snow, the weatherwise said. Suddenly\nMiss Alma drew back from the window with a quick flush on her face that\ncertainly was not caused by the coming of her father. A dapper young\nman sprang lightly up the steps, and pressed the electric button at the\ndoor. When the young man entered the room a moment later Miss Alma was\nsitting demurely by the open fire. He advanced quickly toward her, and\ntook both her outstretched hands in his. Then, furtively looking around\nthe room, he greeted her still more affectionately, in a manner that\nthe chronicler of these incidents, is not bound to particularize.\nHowever, the fact may be mentioned that whatever resistance the young\nwoman thought fit to offer was of the faintest and most futile kind,\nand so it will be understood, at the beginning, that these two young\npersons had a very good understanding with each other.\n\n\"You seem surprised to see me,\" he began.\n\n\"Well, Walter, I understood that you left last time with some\nenergetically expressed resolutions never to darken our doors again.\"\n\n\"Well, you see, my dear, I am sometimes a little hasty; and, in fact,\nthe weather is so dark nowadays, anyhow, that a little extra darkness\ndoes not amount to much, and so I thought I would take the risk of\ndarkening them once more.\"\n\n\"But I also understood that my father made you promise, or that you\npromised voluntarily, not to see me again without his permission?\"\n\n\"Not voluntarily. Far from it. Under compulsion, I assure you. But I\ndidn't come to see you at all. That's where you are mistaken. The\nseeing you is merely an accident, which I have done my best to avoid.\nFact! The girl said, 'Won't you walk into the drawing-room,' and\nnaturally I did so. Never expected to find you here. I thought I saw a\nyoung lady at the window as I came up, but I got such a momentary\nglimpse that I might have been mistaken.\"\n\n\"Then I will leave you and not interrupt----\"\n\n\"Not at all. Now I beg of you not to leave on my account, Alma. You\nknow I would not put you to any trouble for the world.\"\n\n\"You are very kind, I am sure, Mr. Brown.\"\n\n\"I am indeed, Miss Temple. All my friends admit that. But now that you\nare here--by the way, I came to see Mr. Temple. Is he at home?\"\n\n\"I am expecting him every moment.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, I'm disappointed; but I guess I will bear up for awhile--\nuntil he comes, you know.\"\n\n\"I thought your last interview with him was not so pleasant that you\nwould so soon seek another.\"\n\n\"The fact is, Alma, we both lost our tempers a bit, and no good ever\ncomes of that. You can't conduct business in a heat, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, then the asking of his daughter's hand was business--a mere\nbusiness proposition, was it?\"\n\n\"Well, I confess he put it that way--very strongly, too. Of course,\nwith me there would have been pleasure mixed with it if he had--but he\ndidn't. See here, Alma--tell me frankly (of course he talked with you\nabout it) what objection he has to me anyhow.\"\n\n\"I suppose you consider yourself such a desirable young man that it\nastonishes you greatly that any person should have any possible\nobjection to you?\"\n\n\"Oh, come now, Alma; don't hit a fellow when he's down, you know. I\ndon't suppose I have more conceit than the average young man; but then,\non the other hand, I am not such a fool, despite appearances, as not to\nknow that I am considered by some people as quite an eligible\nindividual. I am not a pauper exactly, and your father knows that. I\ndon't think I have many very bad qualities. I don't get drunk; I don't\n--oh, I could give quite a list of the things I don't do.\"\n\n\"You are certainly frank enough, my eligible young man. Still you must\nnot forget that my papa is considered quite an eligible father-in-law,\nif it comes to that.\"\n\n\"Why, of course, I admit it. How could it be otherwise when he has such\na charming daughter?\"\n\n\"You know I don't mean that, Walter. You were speaking of wealth and so\nwas I. Perhaps we had better change the subject.\"\n\n\"By the way, that reminds me of what I came to see you about. What do----\"\n\n\"To see me? I thought you came to see my father.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--certainly--I did come to see him, of course, but in case I\nsaw you, I thought I would ask you for further particulars in the case.\nI have asked you the question but you have evaded the answer. You did\nnot tell me why he is so prejudiced against me. Why did he receive me\nin such a gruff manner when I spoke to him about it? It is not a\ncriminal act to ask a man for his daughter. It is not, I assure you. I\nlooked up the law on the subject, and a young friend of mine, who is a\nbarrister, says there is no statute in the case made and provided. The\nlaw of the State of New York does not recognize my action as against\nthe peace and prosperity of the commonwealth. Well, he received me as\nif I had been caught robbing the bank. Now I propose to know what the\nobjection is. I am going to hear----\"\n\n\"Hush! Here is papa now.\"\n\nMiss Alma quickly left the room, and met her father in the hall. Mr.\nBrown stood with his hands in his pockets and his back to the fire. He\nheard the gruff voice of Mr. Temple say, apparently in answer to some\ninformation given him by his daughter: \"Is he? What does he want?\"\n\nThere was a moment's pause, and then the same voice said:\n\n\"Very well, I will see him in the library in a few minutes.\"\n\nSomehow the courage of young Mr. Brown sank as he heard the banker's\nvoice, and the information he had made up his mind to demand with some\nhauteur, he thought he would ask, perhaps, in a milder manner.\n\nMr. Brown brightened up as the door opened, but it was not Miss Alma\nwho came in. The servant said to him:\n\n\"Mr. Temple is in the library, sir. Will you come this way!\"\n\nHe followed and found the banker seated at his library table, on which\nhe had just placed some legal-looking papers, bound together with a\nthick rubber band. It was evident that his work did not stop when he\nleft the bank. Young Brown noticed that Mr. Temple looked careworn and\nhaggard, and that his manner was very different from what it had been\non the occasion of the last interview.\n\n\"Good evening, Mr. Brown. I am glad you called. I was on the point of\nwriting to you, but the subject of our talk the other night was crowded\nfrom my mind by more important matters.\"\n\nYoung Mr. Brown thought bitterly that there ought not to be matters\nmore important to a father than his daughter's happiness, but he had\nthe good sense not to say so.\n\n\"I spoke to you on that occasion with a--in a manner that was--well,\nhardly excusable, and I wish to say that I am sorry I did so. What I\nhad to state might have been stated with more regard for your\nfeelings.\"\n\n\"Then may I hope, Mr. Temple, that you have changed your mind with----\"\n\n\"No, sir. What I said then--that is, the substance of what I said, not\nthe manner of saying it--I still adhere to.\"\n\n\"May I ask what objection you have to me?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I have the same objection that I have to the majority of\nthe society young men of the present day. If I make inquiries about\nyou, what do I find? That you are a noted oarsman--that you have no\nprofession--that your honors at college consisted in being captain of\nthe football team, and----\"\n\n\"No, no, the baseball club.\"\n\n\"Same thing, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Quite different, I assure you, Mr. Temple.\"\n\n\"Well, it is the same to me at any rate. Now, in my time young men had\na harder row to hoe, and they hoed it. I am what they call a self-made\nman and probably I have a harsher opinion of the young men of the\npresent day than I should have. But if I had a son I would endeavor to\nhave him know how to do something, and then I would see that he did\nit.\"\n\n\"I am obliged to you for stating your objection, Mr. Temple. I have\ntaken my degree in Harvard law school, but I have never practiced,\nbecause, as the little boy said, I didn't have to. Perhaps if some one\nhad spoken to me as you have done I would have pitched in and gone to\nwork. It is not too late yet. Will you give me a chance? The position\nof cashier in your bank, for instance?\"\n\nThe effect of these apparently innocent words on Mr. Temple was\nstartling. He sprang to his feet and brought down his clenched fist on\nthe table with a vehemence that made young Mr. Brown jump. \"What do you\nmean, sir?\" he cried, sternly. \"What do you mean by saying such a\nthing?\"\n\n\"Why, I--I--I--mean----\" stammered Brown, but he could get no further. He\nthought the old man had suddenly gone crazy. He glared across the\nlibrary table at Brown as if the next instant he would spring at his\nthroat. Then the haggard look came into his face again, he passed his\nhand across his brow, and sank into his chair with a groan.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Brown, approaching him, \"what is the matter? Is\nthere anything I can----\"\n\n\"Sit down, please,\" answered the banker, melancholy. \"You will excuse\nme I hope, I am very much troubled. I did not intend to speak of it,\nbut some explanation is due to you. A month from now, if you are the\nkind of man that most of your fellows are, you will not wish to marry\nmy daughter. There is every chance that at that time the doors of my\nbank will be closed.\"\n\n\"You astonish me, sir. I thought----\"\n\n\"Yes, and so every one thinks. I have seldom in my life trusted the\nwrong man, but this time I have done so, and the one mistake seems\nlikely to obliterate all that I have succeeded in doing in a life of\nhard work.\"\n\n\"If I can be of any financial assistance I will be glad to help you.\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know--50,000 dollars perhaps or----\"\n\n\"I must have 250,000 dollars before the end of this month.\"\n\n\"Two hundred and fifty thousand!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. William L. Staples, the cashier of our bank, is now in\nCanada with half a million of the bank funds. No one knows it but\nmyself and one or two of the directors. It is generally supposed that\nhe has gone to Washington on a vacation.\"\n\n\"But can't you put detectives on his track?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Then the theft would be made public at once. The papers\nwould be full of it. There might be a run on the bank, and we would\nhave to close the doors the next day. To put the detectives on his\ntrack would merely mean bringing disaster on our own heads. Staples is\nquite safe, and he knows it. Thanks to an idiotic international\narrangement he is as free from danger of arrest in Canada as you are\nhere. It is impossible to extradite him for stealing.\"\n\n\"But I think there is a law against bringing stolen money into Canada.\"\n\n\"Perhaps there is. It would not help us at the present moment. We must\ncompromise with him, if we can find him in time. Of course, even if the\nbank closed, we would pay everything when there was time to realize.\nBut that is not the point. It would mean trouble and disaster, and\nwould probably result in other failures all through one man's\nrascality.\"\n\n\"Then it all resolves itself to this. Staples must be found quietly and\nnegotiated with. Mr. Temple, let me undertake the finding of him, and\nthe negotiating, also, if you will trust me.\"\n\n\"Do you know him?\"\n\n\"Never saw him in my life.\"\n\n\"Here is his portrait. He is easily recognized from that. You couldn't\nmistake him. He is probably living at Montreal under an assumed name.\nHe may have sailed for Europe. You will say nothing of this to\nanybody?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. I will leave on to-night's train for Montreal, or on\nthe first train that goes.\"\n\nYoung Mr. Brown slipped the photograph into his pocket and shook hands\nwith the banker. Somehow his confident, alert bearing inspired the old\nman with more hope than he would have cared to admit, for, as a general\nthing, he despised the average young man.\n\n\"How long can you hold out if this does not become public?\"\n\n\"For a month at least; probably for two or three.\"\n\n\"Well, don't expect to hear from me too soon. I shall not risk writing.\nIf there is anything to communicate, I will come myself.\"\n\n\"It is very good of you to take my trouble on your shoulders like this.\nI am very much obliged to you.\"\n\n\"I am not a philanthropist, Mr. Temple,\" replied young Brown.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nWhen young Mr. Brown stepped off the train at the Central Station in\nToronto, a small boy accosted him.\n\n\"Carry your valise up for you, sir?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Brown, handing it to him.\n\n\"How much do I owe you?\" he asked at the lobby of the hotel.\n\n\"Twenty-five cents,\" said the boy promptly, and he got it.\n\nBrown registered on the books of the hotel as John A. Walker, of\nMontreal.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nMr. Walter Brown, of Rochester, was never more discouraged in his life\nthan at the moment he wrote on the register the words, \"John A. Walker,\nMontreal.\" He had searched Montreal from one end to the other, but had\nfound no trace of the man for whom he was looking. Yet, strange to say,\nwhen he raised his eyes from the register they met the face of William\nL. Staples, ex-cashier. It was lucky for Brown that Staples was looking\nat the words he had written, and not at himself, or he would have\nnoticed Brown's involuntary start of surprise, and flush of pleasure.\nIt was also rather curious that Mr. Brown had a dozen schemes in his\nmind for getting acquainted with Staples when he met him, and yet that\nthe first advance should be made by Staples himself.\n\n\"You are from Montreal,\" said Mr. Staples, alias John Armstrong.\n\n\"That's my town,\" said Mr. Brown.\n\n\"What sort of a place is it in winter? Pretty lively?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. Good deal of a winter city, Montreal is. How do you mean,\nbusiness or sport?\"\n\n\"Well, both. Generally where there's lots of business there's lots of\nfun.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's so,\" assented Brown. He did not wish to prolong the\nconversation. He had some plans to make, so he followed his luggage up\nto his room. It was evident that he would have to act quickly. Staples\nwas getting tired of Toronto.\n\nTwo days after Brown had his plans completed. He met Staples one\nevening in the smoking-room of the hotel.\n\n\"Think of going to Montreal?\" asked Brown.\n\n\"I did think of it. I don't know, though. Are you in business there?\"\n\n\"Yes. If you go, I could give you some letters of introduction to a lot\nof fellows who would show you some sport, that is, if you care for\nsnow-shoeing, toboganning, and the like of that.\"\n\n\"I never went in much for athletics,\" said Staples.\n\n\"I don't care much for exertion myself,\" answered Brown. \"I come up\nhere every winter for some ice-yachting. That's my idea of sport. I own\none of the fastest ice-boats on the bay. Ever been out?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't. I've seen them at it a good deal. Pretty cold work such\nweather as we've been having, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I don't think so. Better come out with me tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't care if I do.\"\n\nThe next day and the next they spun around the bay on the ice-boat.\nEven Staples, who seemed to be tired of almost everything, liked the\nswiftness and exhilaration of the iceboat.\n\nOne afternoon, Brown walked into the bar of the hotel, where he found\nStaples standing.\n\n\"See here, Armstrong.\" he cried, slapping that gentleman on the\nshoulder. \"Are you in for a bit of sport? It's a nice moonlight night,\nand I'm going to take a spin down to Hamilton to meet some chaps, and\nwe can come back on the iceboat, or if you think it too late, you can\nstay over, and come back on the train.\"\n\n\"Hamilton? That's up the lake, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, just a nice run from here. Come along--I counted on you.\"\n\nAn hour later they were skimming along the frozen surface of the lake.\n\n\"Make yourself warm and snug,\" said Brown. \"That's what the buffalo\nrobes are for. I must steer, so I have to keep in the open. If I were\nyou I'd wrap up in those robes and go to sleep. I'll wake you when\nwe're there.\"\n\n\"All right,\" answered Staples. \"That's not a bad idea.\"\n\n\"General George Washington!\" said young Brown to himself. \"This is too\nsoft a snap altogether. I'm going to run him across the lake like a\nlamb. Before he opens his eyes we'll have skimmed across the frozen\nlake, and he'll find himself in the States again when he wakes up. The\nonly thing now to avoid are the air-holes and ice-hills, and I'm all\nright.\"\n\nHe had been over the course before and knew pretty well what was ahead\nof him. The wind was blowing stiffly straight up the lake and the boat\nsilently, and swifter than the fastest express, was flying from Canada\nand lessening the distance to the American shore.\n\n\"How are you getting along, Walker,\" cried Staples, rousing himself up.\n\"First rate,\" answered Brown. \"We'll soon be there, Staples.\"\n\nThat unfortunate slip of the tongue almost cost young Mr. Brown his\nlife. He had been, thinking of the man under his own name, and the name\nhad come out unconsciously. He did not even notice it himself in time\nto prepare, and the next instant the thief flung himself upon him and\njammed his head against the iron rod that guided the rudder, with such\na force that the rudder stayed in its place and the boat flew along the\nice without a swerve.\n\n\"You scoundrel!\" roared the bank-robber. \"That's your game, is it? By\nthe gods, I'll teach you a lesson in the detective business!\"\n\nAthlete as young Brown was, the suddenness of the attack, and the fact\nthat Staples clutched both hands round his neck and had his knee on his\nbreast, left him as powerless as an infant. Even then he did not\nrealize what had caused the robber to guess his position.\n\n\"For God's sake, let me up!\" gasped Brown. \"We'll be into an air-hole\nand drowned in a moment.\"\n\n\"I'll risk it, you dog! till I've choked the breath out of your body.\"\nBrown wriggled his head away from the rudder iron, hoping that the boat\nwould slew around, but it kept its course. He realized that if he was\nto save his life he would have to act promptly. He seemed to feel his\ntongue swell in his parched mouth. His strength was gone and his throat\nwas in an iron vice. He struck out wildly with his feet and one\nfortunate kick sent the rudder almost at right angles.\n\nInstantly the boat flashed around into the wind. Even if a man is\nprepared for such a thing, it takes all his nerve and strength to keep\nhim on an iceboat. Staples was not prepared. He launched head first\ninto space and slid for a long distance on the rough ice. Brown was\nalso flung on the ice and lay for a moment gasping for breath. Then he\ngathered himself together, and slipping his hand under his coat, pulled\nout his revolver. He thought at first that Staples was shamming, but a\ncloser examination of him showed that the fall on the ice had knocked\nhim senseless.\n\nThere was only one thing that young Mr. Brown was very anxious to know.\nHe wanted to know where the money was. He had played the part of\nprivate detective well in Toronto, after the very best French style,\nand had searched the room of Staples in his absence, but he knew the\nmoney was not there nor in his valise. He knew equally well that the\nfunds were in some safe deposit establishment in the city, but where he\ncould not find out. He had intended to work on Staples' fears of\nimprisonment when once he had him safe on the other side of the line.\nBut now that the man was insensible, he argued that it was a good time\nto find whether or not he had a record of the place of deposit in his\npocket-book. He found no such book in his pockets. In searching,\nhowever, he heard the rustling of paper apparently in the lining of his\ncoat. Then he noticed how thickly it was padded. The next moment he had\nit ripped open, and a glance showed him that it was lined with bonds.\nBoth coat and vest were padded in this way--the vest being filled with\nBank of England notes, so the chances were that Staples had meditated a\ntour in Europe. The robber evidently put no trust in Safe Deposits nor\nbanks. Brown flung the thief over on his face, after having unbuttoned\ncoat and vest, doubled back his arms and pulled off these garments. His\nown, Brown next discarded, and with some difficulty got them on the\nfallen man and then put on the clothes of mammon.\n\n\"This is what I call rolling in wealth.\" said Brown to himself. He\nadmitted that he felt decidedly better after the change of clothing,\ncold as it was.\n\nButtoning his own garments on the prostrate man, Brown put a flask of\nliquor to his lips and speedily revived him. Staples sat on the ice in\na dazed manner, and passed his hand across his brow. In the cold gleam\nof the moonlight he saw the shining barrel of Brown's revolver\n\"covering\" him.\n\n\"It's all up, Mr. Staples. Get on board the iceboat.\"\n\n\"Where are you going to take me to?\"\n\n\"I'll let you go when we come to the coast if you tell me where the\nmoney is.\"\n\n\"You know you are guilty of the crime of kidnapping,\" said Mr. Staples,\napparently with the object of gaining time. \"So you are in some danger\nof the law yourself.\"\n\n\"That is a question that can be discussed later on. You came\nvoluntarily, don't forget that fact. Where's the money?\"\n\n\"It is on deposit in the Bank of Commerce.\"\n\n\"Well, here's paper and a stylographic pen, if the ink isn't frozen--\nno, it's all right--write a cheque quickly for the amount payable to\nbearer. Hurry up, or the ink will freeze.\"\n\nThere was a smile of satisfaction on the face of Staples as he wrote\nthe check.\n\n\"There,\" he said, with a counterfeited sigh. \"That is the amount.\"\n\nThe check was for 480,000 dollars.\n\nWhen they came under the shadow of the American coast, Brown ordered\nhis passenger off.\n\n\"You can easily reach land from here, and the walk will do you good.\nI'm going further up the lake.\"\n\nWhen Staples was almost at the land he shouted through the clear night\nair: \"Don't spend the money recklessly when you get it, Walker.\"\n\n\"I'll take care of it, Staples,\" shouted back young Brown.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nYoung Mr. Brown sprang lightly up the steps of the Temple mansion,\nRochester, and pressed the electric button.\n\n\"Has Mr. Temple gone to the bank yet?\" he asked the servant.\n\n\"No, sir; he is in the library.\"\n\n\"Thank you. Don't trouble. I know the way.\"\n\nMr. Temple looked around as the young man entered, and, seeing who it\nwas, sprang to his feet with a look of painful expectancy on his face.\n\"There's a little present for you,\" said Mr. Brown, placing a package\non the table. \"Four hundred and seventy-eight thousand: Bank of England\nnotes and United States bonds.\" The old man grasped his hand, strove to\nspeak, but said nothing.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nPeople wondered why young Mr. and Mrs. Brown went to Toronto on their\nwedding tour in the depth of winter. It was so very unusual, don't you\nknow.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SIXTH BENCH.\n\n\nShe was in earnest; he was not. When that state of things exists\nanything may happen. The occurrence may be commonplace, comic, or\ntragic, depending on the temperament and experience of the woman. In\nthis instance the result was merely an appointment--which both of them\nkept.\n\nHector McLane came to Paris with noble resolutions, a theory of color,\nand a small allowance. Paris played havoc with all of these. He was\nengaged to a nice girl at home, who believed him destined to become a\ngreat painter; a delusion which McLane shared.\n\nHe entered with great zest into the life of a Parisian art student, but\nsomehow the experience did not equal his anticipations. What he had\nread in books--poetry and prose--had thrown a halo around the Latin\nQuarter, and he was therefore disappointed in finding the halo missing.\nThe romance was sordid and mercenary, and after a few months of it he\nyearned for something better.\n\nIn Paris you may have nearly everything--except the something better.\nIt exists, of course, but it rarely falls in the way of the usually\nimpecunious art student. Yet it happened that, as luck was not against\nthe young man, he found it when he had abandoned the search for it.\n\nMcLane's theory was that art had become too sombre. The world was\nrunning overmuch after the subdued in color. He wanted to be able to\npaint things as they are, and was not to be deterred if his pictures\nwere called gaudy. He obtained permission to set up his easel in the\nChurch of Notre Dame, and in the dim light there, he endeavored to\nplace on canvas some semblance of the splendor of color that came\nthrough the huge rose window high above him. He was discouraged to see\nhow opaque the colors in the canvas were as compared with the\ntranslucent hues of the great window. As he leaned back with a sigh of\ndefeat, his wandering eyes met, for one brief instant, something more\nbeautiful than the stained glass, as the handiwork of God must always\nbe more beautiful than the handiwork of man. The fleeting glimpse was\nof a melting pair of dark limpid eyes, which, meeting his, were\ninstantly veiled, and then he had a longer view of the sweet face they\nbelonged to. It was evident that the young girl had been admiring his\nwork, which was more than he could hope to have the professor at\nJulien's do.\n\nLack of assurance was never considered, even by his dearest friend, to\nbe among McLane's failings. He rose from his painting stool, bowed and\nasked her if she would not sit down for a moment; she could see the--\nthe--painting so much better. The girl did not answer, but turned a\nfrightened look upon him, and fled under the wing of her kneeling\nduenna, who had not yet finished her devotions. It was evident that the\nprayers of the girl had been briefer than those of the old woman in\nwhose charge she was. Where the need is greatest the prayer is often\nthe shortest. McLane had one more transitory glimpse of those dark eyes\nas he held open the swinging door. The unconscious woman and the\nconscious girl passed out of the church.\n\nThis was how it began.\n\nThe painting of the colored window of Notre Dame now occupied almost\nall the time at the disposal of Hector McLane. No great work is ever\naccomplished without unwearied perseverance. It was remarkable that the\nrealization of this truth came upon him just after he had definitely\nmade up his mind to abandon the task. Before he allowed the swinging\ndoor to close he had resolved to pursue his study in color. It thus\nhappened, incidentally, that he saw the young girl again, always at the\nsame hour, and always with the same companion. Once he succeeded,\nunnoticed by the elder, in slipping a note into her hand, which he was\npleased and flattered to see she retained and concealed. Another day he\nhad the joy of having a few whispered words with her in the dim shadow\nof one of the gigantic pillars. After that, progress was comparatively\neasy.\n\nHer name was Yvette, he learned, and he was amused to find with what\nexpert dexterity a perfectly guileless and innocent little creature\nsuch as she was, managed to elude the vigilance of the aged and\nexperienced woman who had her in charge. The stolen interviews usually\ntook place in the little park behind Notre Dame. There they sat on the\nbench facing the fountain, or walked up and down on the crunching\ngravel under the trees. In the afternoons they walked in the secluded\npart of the park, in the shadow of the great church. It was her custom\nto send him dainty little notes telling him when she expected to be in\nthe park, giving the number of the bench, for sometimes the duenna\ncould not be eluded, and was seated there with Yvette. On these\noccasions McLane had to content himself with gazing from afar.\n\nShe was so much in earnest that the particular emotion which occupied\nthe place of conscience in McLane's being, was troubled. He thought of\nthe nice girl at home, and fervently hoped nothing of this would ever\nreach her ears. No matter how careful a man is, chance sometimes plays\nhim a scurvy trick. McLane remembered instances, and regretted the\nworld was so small. Sometimes a cry of recognition from one on the\npavement to a comrade in the park, shouted through the iron railings,\nsent a shiver through McLane. Art students had an uncomfortable habit\nof roaming everywhere, and they were boisterous in hailing an\nacquaintance. Besides, they talked, and McLane dreaded having his\nlittle intrigue the joke of the school. At any moment an objectionable\nart student might drop into the park to sketch the fountain, or the\nnurses and children, or the back of the cathedral at one end of the\npark, or even the low, gloomy, unimposing front of the Morgue at the\nother.\n\nHe was an easy-going young fellow, who hated trouble, and perhaps,\nknowing that the inevitable day of reckoning was approaching, this\naccounted for the somewhat tardy awakening of his conscience.\n\nHe sometimes thought it would be best simply to leave Paris without any\nexplanation, but he remembered that she knew his address, having\nwritten to him often, and that by going to the school she could easily\nfind out where his home was. So if there was to be a scene it was much\nbetter that it should take place in Paris, rather than where the nice\ngirl lived.\n\nHe nerved himself up many times to make the explanation and bring down\nthe avalanche, but when the time came he postponed it. But the\ninevitable ultimately arrives. He had some difficulty at first in\ngetting her to understand the situation clearly, but when he at last\nsucceeded there was no demonstration. She merely kept her eyes fixed on\nthe gravel and gently withdrew her hand from his. To his surprise she\ndid not cry, nor even answer him, but walked silently to and fro with\ndowncast eyes in the shadow of the church. No one, he said, would ever\noccupy the place in his heart that she held. He was engaged to the\nother girl, but he had not known what love was until he met Yvette. He\nwas bound to the other girl by ties he could not break, which was quite\ntrue, because the nice girl had a rich father. He drew such a pathetic\npicture of the loveless life he must in the future lead, that a great\nwave of self-pity surged up within him and his voice quavered. He felt\nalmost resentful that she should take the separation in such an\nunemotional manner. When a man gets what he most desires he is still\nunsatisfied. This was exactly the way he had hoped she would take it.\n\nAll things come to an end, even explanations.\n\n\"Well, good-bye, Yvette,\" he said, reaching out his hand. She hesitated\nan instant, then without looking up, placed her small palm in his.\n\nThey stood thus for a moment under the trees, while the fountain beside\nthem plashed and trickled musically. The shadow of the church was\nslowly creeping towards them over the gravel. The park was deserted,\nexcept by themselves. She tried gently to withdraw her hand, which he\nretained.\n\n\"Have you nothing to say to me, Yvette?\" he asked, with a touch of\nreproach in his voice.\n\nShe did not answer. He held her fingers, which were slipping from his\ngrasp, and the shadow touched her feet.\n\n\"Yvette, you will at least kiss me goodbye?\"\n\nShe quickly withdrew her hand from his, shook her head and turned away.\nHe watched her until she was out of sight, and then walked slowly\ntowards his rooms on the Boulevard St. Germain. His thoughts were not\ncomfortable. He was disappointed in Yvette. She was so clever, so\nwitty, that he had at least expected she would have said something\ncutting, which he felt he thoroughly deserved. He had no idea she could\nbe so heartless. Then his thoughts turned to the nice girl at home.\nShe, too, had elements in her character that were somewhat bewildering\nto an honest young man. Her letters for a long time had been infrequent\nand unsatisfactory. It couldn't be possible that she had heard\nanything. Still, there is nothing so easy as point-blank denial, and he\nwould see to that when he reached home.\n\nAn explanation awaited him at his rooms on the Boulevard. There was a\nforeign stamp on the envelope, and it was from the nice girl. There had\nbeen a mistake, she wrote, but happily she had discovered it before it\nwas too late. She bitterly reproached herself, taking three pages to do\nit in, and on the fourth page he gathered that she would be married by\nthe time he had the letter. There appeared to be no doubt that the nice\ngirl fully realized how basely she had treated a talented, hard-\nworking, aspiring, sterling young man, but the realization had not\nseemingly postponed the ringing of the wedding-bells to any appreciable\nextent.\n\nYoung McLane crushed the letter in his hand and used strong language,\nas, indeed, he was perfectly justified in doing. He laughed a hard dry\nlaugh at the perfidy of woman. Then his thoughts turned towards Yvette.\nWhat a pity it was she was not rich! Like so many other noble, talented\nmen, he realized he could not marry a poor woman. Suddenly it occurred\nto him that Yvette might not be poor. The more he pondered over the\nmatter the more astonished he was that he had ever taken her poverty\nfor granted. She dressed richly, and that cost money in Paris. He\nremembered that she wore a watch which flashed with jewels on the one\noccasion when he had seen it for a moment. He wished he had postponed\nhis explanation for one more day; still, that was something easily\nremedied. He would tell her he had thrown over the other girl for her\nsake. Like a pang there came to him the remembrance that he did not\nknow her address, nor even her family name. Still, she would be sure to\nvisit the little park, and he would haunt it until she came. The\nhaunting would give additional point to his story of consuming love.\nAnyhow, nothing could be done that night.\n\nIn the morning he was overjoyed to receive a letter from Yvette, and he\nwas more than pleased when he read its contents. It asked for one more\nmeeting behind the church.\n\n\n\"I could not tell you to-day,\" she wrote, \"all I felt. To-morrow you\nshall know, if you meet me. Do not fear that I will reproach you. You\nwill receive this letter in the morning. At twelve o'clock I shall be\nwaiting for you on the sixth bench on the row south of the fountain--\nthe sixth bench--the farthest from the church.\"\n                                                 \"YVETTE.\"\n\nMcLane was overjoyed at his good luck. He felt that he hardly merited\nit. He was early at the spot, and sat down on the last bench of the row\nfacing the fountain. Yvette had not yet arrived, but it was still half\nan hour before the time. McLane read the morning paper and waited. At\nlast the bells all around him chimed the hour of twelve. She had not\ncome. This was unusual, but always possible. She might not have\nsucceeded in getting away. The quarter and then the half hour passed\nbefore McLane began to suspect that he had been made the victim of a\npractical joke. He dismissed the thought; such a thing was so unlike\nher. He walked around the little park, hoping he had mistaken the row\nof benches. She was not there. He read the letter again. It was plain\nenough--the sixth bench. He counted the benches beginning at the\nchurch. One--two--three--four--five. There were only five benches in\nthe row.\n\nAs he gazed stupidly at the fifth bench a man beside him said--\"That is\nthe bench, sir.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" cried McLane, turning toward him, astonished at the\nremark.\n\n\"It was there that the young girl was found dead this morning--\npoisoned, they say.\"\n\nMcLane stared at him--and then he said huskily--\n\n\"Who--was she?\"\n\n\"Nobody knows that--yet. We will soon know, for everybody, as you see,\nis going into the Morgue. She's the only one on the bench to-day.\nBetter go before the crowd gets greater. I have been twice.\"\n\nMcLane sank on the seat and drew his hand across his forehead.\n\nHe knew she was waiting for him on the sixth bench--the furthest from\nthe church!\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FACE AND THE MASK ***\n\n******* This file should be named 8681-8.txt or 8681-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/8/6/8/8681\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n"}
