Deeper flashes through the mist betokened water, and\ngreen patches hinted of rich vegetation. The space-patroller circled the\nlittle world knowledgeably, like a wasp buzzing around an apple. In the\ncontrol room, by the forward ports, the Martian skipper addressed his\nTerrestrial companion.\n\n\"I wissh you joy of yourr new home,\" he purred. Like many Martians, he\nwas braced upright on his lower tentacles by hoops and buckles around\nhis bladdery body, so that he had roughly a human form, over which lay a\nstrange loose armor of light plates. In the breathing hole of his\npetal-tufted skull was lodged an artificial voice-box that achieved\nwords. \"I rregrret--\"\n\nFitzhugh Parr glowered back. He was tall, even for a man of Earth, and\nhis long-jawed young face darkened with wrath. \"Regret nothing,\" he\nsnapped. \"You're jolly glad to drop me on this little hell.\"\n\n\"Hell?\" repeated the Martian reproachfully. \"But it iss a ssplendid\nminiaturre worrld--nineteen of yourr miless in diameterr, with\narrtificial grravity centerr to hold airr and waterr; ssown, too, with\nTerresstrrial plantss. And companionss of yourr own rrace.\"\n\n[Illustration: _\"You! They drive you out?\" A thick, unsure voice\naccosted him._]\n\n\"There's a catch,\" rejoined Parr. \"Something you Martian swine think is\na heap big joke. I can see that, captain.\"\n\nThe tufted head wagged. \"Underr trreaty between Marrs and Earrth,\njudgess of one planet cannot ssentence to death crriminalss frrom the\notherr, not even forr murrderr--\"\n\n\"It wasn't for murder!\" exploded Parr. \"I struck in self-defense!\"\n\n\"I cannot arrgue the point. Yourr victim wass a high official perrhapss\ninssolent, but you Earrth folk forrget how eassy ourr crraniumss crrack\nunderr yourr blowss. Anyway, you do not die--you arre exiled. Prreparre\nto dissembarrk.\"\n\nBehind them three Martian space-hands, sprawling like squids near the\ncontrol-board, made flutelike comments to each other. The tentacle of\neach twiddled an electro-automatic pistol.\n\n\"Rremove tunic and bootss,\" directed the skipper. \"You will not need\nthem. Quickly, ssirr!\"\n\nParr glared at the levelled weapons of the space-hands, then shucked his\nupper garment and kicked off his boots. He stood up straight and\nlean-muscled, in a pair of duck shorts. His fists clenched at his sides.\n\n\"Now we grround,\" the skipper continued, and even as he spoke there came\nthe shock of the landfall. The inner panel opened, then the outer\nhatch. Sunlight beat into the chamber. \"Goodbye,\" said the skipper\nformally. \"You have thirrty ssecondss, Earrth time, to walk clearr of\nour blasstss beforre we take off. Marrch.\"\n\nParr strode out upon dark, rich soil. He sensed behind him the silent\nquiver of Martian laughter, and felt a new ecstasy of hate for his late\nguards, their race, and the red planet that spawned them. Not until he\nheard the rumble and swish of the ship's departure did he take note of\nthe little world that was now his prison home.\n\nAt first view it wasn't really bad. At second, it wasn't really strange.\nThe sky, by virtue of an Earth-type atmosphere, shone blue with wispy\nclouds, and around the small plain on which he stood sprouted clumps and\nthickets of green tropical trees. Heathery ferns, with white and yellow\nedges to their leaves, grew under his bare feet. The sun, hovering at\nzenith, gave a July warmth to the air. The narrow horizon was very near,\nof course, but the variety of thickets and the broken nature of the land\nbeyond kept it from seeming too different from the skyline of Earth.\nParr decided that he might learn to endure, even to enjoy. Meanwhile,\nwhat about the other Terrestrials exiled here? And, as Parr wondered, he\nheard their sudden, excited voices.\n\nThreats and oaths rent the balmy air. Through the turmoil resounded\nsolid blows. Parr broke into a run, shoved through some broad-leafed\nbushes, and found himself in the midst of the excitement.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA dozen men, with scraggly beards and skimpy rags of clothing, were\nsetting upon an unclassifiable creature that snarled and fought back. It\nwas erect and coarsely hairy--Parr saw that much before the enigma gave\nup the unequal fight and ran clumsily away into a mass of\nbright-flowered scrub. Execrations and a volley of sticks and stones\nspeeded its flight.\n\nThen the mob was aware of Parr. Every man--they were all male\nTerrestrials--turned toward him, with something like respect. One of\nthem, tall and thin, spoke diffidently:\n\n\"You just arrived?\"\n\n\"I was just booted out, ten minutes ago,\" Parr informed him. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you're our new chief,\" responded the thin man, bowing. \"The\nlatest comer always commands here.\"\n\nParr must have goggled, for the thin one smiled through tawny stubble.\n\"The latest comer is always highest and wisest,\" he elaborated. \"He is\nhealthiest. Best. The longer you stay on this asteroid, the lower you\nfall.\"\n\nParr thought he was being joked with, and scowled. But his informant\nsmiled the broader. \"My name's Sadau--here under sentence for theft of\nMartian government property.\"\n\n\"I'm Fitzhugh Parr. They said I was a murderer. It's a lie.\"\n\nOne or two chuckled at that, and the one who called himself Sadau said:\n\"We all feel unjustly condemned. Meet the others--Jeffords, Wain,\nHaldocott....\" Each man, as named, bowed to Parr. The final introduction\nwas of a sallow, frowning lump of a fellow called Shanklin.\n\n\"I was boss until you came,\" volunteered this last man. \"Now you take\nover.\" He waved toward a little cluster of grass huts, half hidden among\nferny palms. \"This is our capital city. You get the largest house--until\nsomebody new shows up. Then you step down, like me.\"\n\nHe spoke with ill grace. Parr did not reply at once, but studied these\nfolk who were putting themselves under his rule. They would not have\nbeen handsome even if shaved and dressed properly. Indeed, two or three\nhad the coarse, low-browed look of profound degenerates. Back into\nParr's mind came the words of Sadau: \"The longer you stay ... the lower\nyou fall.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Parr at last, \"before I accept command or other\noffice, give me information. Just now you were acting violently. You,\nSadau, started explaining. Go ahead.\"\n\nSadau shrugged a lean freckled shoulder, and with a jerk of his head\ndirected his companions to retire toward the huts. They obeyed, with one\nor two backward glances. Left alone with Parr, Sadau looked up with a\nwise, friendly expression.\n\n\"I won't waste time trying to be scientific or convincing. I'll give you\nfacts--we older exiles know them only too well. This asteroid seems a\nsort of Eden to you, I daresay.\"\n\n\"I told the Martians that I knew there was a catch somewhere.\"\n\n\"Your instinct's sound. The catch is this: Living\ncreatures--Terrestrials anyway--degenerate here. They go backward in\nevolution, become--\" Sadau broke off a moment, for his lips had begun to\nquiver. \"They become beasts,\" he finished.\n\n\"What?\" growled Parr. \"You mean that men turn into apes?\"\n\n\"Yes. And the apes turn into lower creatures. Those become lower\ncreatures still.\" Sadau's eyes were earnest and doleful. \"The process\nmay run back and down to the worm, for all we can judge. We try not to\nthink too much about it.\"\n\n\"This is a joke of some kind,\" protested Parr, but Sadau was not\nsmiling.\n\n\"Martian joke, perhaps. The treaty keeps them from killing us--and this\nis their alternative punishment. It makes death trivial by\ncomparison.... You don't believe. It's hard. But you see that some of\nus, oldest in point of exile, are sliding back into bestiality. And you\nsaw us drive away, as our custom is, a man who had definitely become a\nbeast.\"\n\n\"That thing was a man?\" prompted Parr, his spine chilling.\n\n\"It had been a man. As you wander here and there, you'll come upon queer\nsights--sickening ones.\"\n\nParr squinted at the huts, around the doors of which lounged the other\nmen. \"That looks like a permanent community, Sadau.\"\n\n\"It is, but the population's floating. I came here three months\nago--Earth months--and the place was operating under the rules I\noutlined. Latest comer, necessarily the highest-grade human being, to be\nchief; those who degenerate beyond a certain point to be driven out; the\nrest to live peaceably together, helping each other.\"\n\nParr only half heard him. \"Evolution turned backward--it can't be true.\nIt's against nature.\"\n\n\"Martians war against nature,\" replied Sadau pithily. \"Mars is a dead\nworld, and its people are devils. They'd be the logical explorers to\nfind a place where such things can be, and to make use of it. Don't\nbelieve me if you don't want to. Time and life here will convince you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the days that followed--the asteroid turned once in approximately\ntwenty-two hours--Parr was driven to belief. Perhaps the slowness of the\nidea's dawning kept him from some form of insanity.\n\nEvery man of the little group that called him chief was on the way to be\na man no more. There were stooped backs among them, a forward hang to\narms, a sprouting of coarse, lank hair. Foreheads fell away, noses\nflattened coarsely, eyes grew small and shifty. Sadau informed Parr that\nsuch evidences of degeneration meant a residence of a year or so on the\nexile asteroid.\n\n\"We'll be driving one or two of them away pretty soon,\" he observed.\n\n\"What then?\" asked Parr. \"What happens to the ones that are driven out?\"\n\n\"Sometimes we notice them, peering through the brush, but mostly they\nhaul out by themselves a little way from here--shaggy brutes, like our\nearliest fathers. There are lower types still. They stay completely\nclear of us.\"\n\nParr asked the question that had haunted him since his first hour of\nexile: \"Sadau, do you see any change in me?\"\n\nSadau smiled and shook his head. \"You won't alter in the least for a\nmonth.\"\n\nThat was reasonable. Man, Parr remembered, has been pretty much the same\nfor the past ten thousand years. If a year brought out the beast in the\nafflicted exiles, then that year must count for a good hundred thousand\nyears turned backward. Five years would be five hundred thousand of\nreverse evolution--in that time, one would be reduced to something\ndefinitely animal. Beyond that, one would drop into the category of\ntailed monkeys, of rodent crawlers--reptiles next, and then--\n\n\"I'll kill myself first,\" he thought, but even as he made the promise he\nknew he would not. Cowards took the suicide way out, the final yielding\nto unjust, cruel mastery by the Martians. Parr stiffened his shoulders,\nthat had grown tanned and vigorous in the healthy air. He spoke grimly\nto Sadau:\n\n\"I don't accept all this yet. It's happened to others, but not to me so\nfar. There's a way of stopping this, and paying off those Martian swine.\nIf it can be done--\"\n\n\"I'm with you, Chief!\" cried Sadau, and they shook hands.\n\nHeartened, he made inquiries. The Martian space-patroller came every\nmonth or so, to drop a new exile. It always landed on the plain where\nParr had first set foot to the asteroid. That gave him an idea, and he\nheld conference in the early evening, with Sadau, Shanklin, and one or\ntwo others of the higher grade.\n\n\"We could capture that craft,\" urged Parr. \"There's only a skipper and\nthree Martians--\"\n\n\"Yes, with pistols and ray throwers,\" objected Shanklin. \"Too big a\nrisk.\"\n\n\"What's the alternative?\" demanded Sadau. \"You want to stay here and\nturn monkey, Shanklin? Chief,\" he added to Parr, \"I said once that I was\non your side. I'll follow wherever you lead.\"\n\n\"Me, too,\" threw in Jeffords, a sturdy man of middle age who had been\nsentenced for killing a Martian in a brawl.\n\n\"And me,\" wound up Haldocott, a blond youth whose skin was burned darker\nthan his hair and downy beard. \"We four can pull it off without\nShanklin.\"\n\nBut Shanklin agreed, with something like good humor, to stand by the\nvote of the majority. The others of the community assented readily, for\nthey were used to acting at the will of their wiser companions. And at\nthe next arrival of the Martian patroller--an observer, posted by Parr\nin a treetop, reported its coming whole hours away--they made a quick\ndisposal of forces around the rocket-scorched plain that did duty for a\nlanding field. Parr consulted for a last moment with Sadau, Shanklin,\nJeffords and Haldocott.\n\n\"We'll lead rushes from different directions,\" he said. \"As the hatchway\ncomes open, the patroller will stall for the moment--can't take off\nuntil it's airtight everywhere. I'll give a yell for signal. Then\neverybody charge. Jam the tubes by smacking the soft metal collars at\nthe nozzles--we can straighten them back when the ship's ours. Out to\nyour places now.\"\n\n\"The first one at the hatch will probably be shot or rayed,\" grumbled\nShanklin.\n\n\"I'll be first there,\" Parr promised him. \"Who wants to live forever,\nanyway? Posts, everybody. Here she comes in.\"\n\nTense, quick-breathing moments thereafter as the craft descended and\nlodged. Then the hatchway opened. Parr, crouching in a clump of bushes\nwith two followers, raised his voice in a battle yell, and rushed.\n\nA figure had come forward to the open hatch, slender and topped with\ntawny curls. It paused and shrank back at the sudden apparition of Parr\nand his men leaping forward. Tentacles swarmed out, trying to push or\npull the figure aside so as to close the hatch again. That took more\nseconds--then Parr had crossed the intervening space. Without even\nlooking at the newcoming exile who had so providentially forestalled the\nclosing of the hatch, he clutched a shoulder and heaved mightily. The\nMartian whose tentacles had reached from within came floundering out,\ndragged along--it was the skipper whose ironic acquaintance Parr had\nmade in his own voyage out, all dressed in that loose-plate armor. Parr\nwrenched a pistol from a tentacle. Yelling again, he fired through the\nopen hatchway. Two space-hands ducked out of sight.\n\n\"We've won!\" yelled Parr, and for a moment he thought they had. But not\nall his followers had charged with his own bold immediacy.\n\nSadau on one side of the ship, Jeffords and Haldocott at the other, had\nrun in close and were walloping manfully at the nozzles of the rocket\ntubes. The outer metal yielded under the blows, threatening to clog the\nthroats of the blasts. Only at the rear was there no attack--Shanklin,\nand with him three or four of the lesser men, had hung back. The few\nmoments' delay there was enough to make all the difference.\n\nThinking and acting wisely, even without a leader, the Martian\nspace-hands met the emergency. They had withdrawn from the open\nhatchway, but could reach the mechanism that closed it. Parr was too\nlate to jump in after them. Then one of them fired the undamaged rear\ntubes.\n\n_Swish! Whang!_ The ship took off so abruptly that Parr barely dodged\naside in time, dragging along with him the new Terrestrial whose\nshoulder he clutched, and also the surprised Martian skipper. The rocket\nblasts, dragging fiery fingers across the plain, struck down Haldocott\nand Jeffords, and bowled over two of the laggards with Shanklin's\nbelated contingent. Then it was away, moving jumpily with its\nhalf-wrecked side tubes, but nevertheless escaping.\n\nParr swore a great oath, that made the stranger gasp. And then Parr had\ntime to see that this was a woman, and young. She was briefly dressed in\nblouse and shorts, her tawny hair was tumbled, her blue eyes wide. To\nher still clung the Martian skipper, and Parr covered him with the\ncaptured pistol. Next instant Shanklin, arriving at last, struck out\nwith his club and shattered the flowerlike cranium inside the plated\ncap. The skipper fell dead on the spot.\n\n\"I wanted him for a prisoner!\" growled Parr.\n\n\"What good would that do?\" flung back Shanklin roughly. \"The ship's what\nwe wanted. It's gone. You bungled, Parr.\"\n\nParr was about to reply with the obvious charge that Shanklin's own\nhesitancy had done much to cause the failure, when Sadau spoke:\n\n\"This young lady--miss, are you an exile? Because,\" and he spoke in the\nsame fashion that he had once employed to Parr, \"then you're our new\nchief. The latest comer commands.\"\n\n\"Why--why--\" stammered the girl.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" interposed Parr again. \"Let's take stock of ourselves.\nHaldocott and Jeffords killed--and a couple of others--\"\n\nShanklin barked at him. \"You don't give orders any more. We've got a new\nchief, and you're just one of the rabble, like me.\" He made a heavily\ngallant bow toward the latest arrival. \"May I ask your name, lady?\"\n\n\"I'm Varina Pemberton,\" she said. \"But what's the meaning of all this?\"\n\nShanklin and Sadau began to explain. The others gathered interestedly\naround. Parr felt suddenly left out, and stooped to look at the dead\nMartian. The body wore several useful things--a belt with ammunition and\na knife-combination, shoes on the thickened ends of the tentacles, and\nthat strange armor. As Parr moved to retrieve these, his companions\ncalled out to halt him.\n\n\"The new chief will decide about those things,\" said Shanklin\nofficiously. \"Especially the gun. Can I have it?\"\n\nTo avoid a crisis, Parr passed the weapon to the girl, who nodded thanks\nand slid it into her own waist-belt. Shanklin asked for, and received,\nthe knife. Sadau was the only man slender enough to wear the shoes, and\ngratefully donned them. Parr looked once again at the armor, which he\nhad drawn free of its dead owner.\n\n\"What's that for?\" asked Shanklin.\n\nParr made no answer, because he did not know. The armor was too loosely\nhung together for protection against weapons. It certainly was no\nspace-overall. And it had nothing of the elegance that might make it a\nMartian uniform of office. Casting back, Parr remembered that the\nskipper had worn it at the time when he, Parr, was landed--but not\nduring the voyage out. He shook his head over the mystery.\n\n\"Let that belong to you,\" the girl Varina Pemberton was telling him. \"It\nhas plates of metal that may be turned to use. Perhaps--\" She seemed to\nbe on the verge of saying something important, but checked herself.\n\n\"If you'll come with us,\" Sadau told her respectfully, \"we'll show you\nwhere we live and where you will rule.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey held council that night among the grass huts--the nine that were\nleft after the unsuccessful attack on the patroller. Varina Pemberton,\nvery pretty in her brief sports costume, sat on the stump that was\nchief's place; but Shanklin did most of the talking.\n\n\"Nobody will argue about our life and prospects being good here,\" he\nthundered, \"but there's no use in making things worse when they're bad\nenough.\" He shook a thick forefinger at Fitzhugh Parr, who wore the\narmor he had stripped from the dead Martian. \"You were chief, and what\nyou said goes. But you're not chief now--you're just the man who\nmurdered four of us!\"\n\n\"Mmm--yes,\" growled one of the lower-fallen listeners, a\nfurry-shouldered, buck-toothed clod named Wain. \"That blast almost got\nme, right behind Haldocott.\" His eyes, grown small, gleamed nastily at\nParr. \"We ought to condemn this man--\"\n\n\"Please,\" interposed Sadau, who alone remained friendly to Parr, \"it's\nfor the chief to condemn.\" He looked to Varina Pemberton, who shook her\nhead slowly.\n\n\"I feel,\" she ventured with her eyes on Parr, \"that this ought to be\nleft up to you as a voting body.\"\n\nShanklin sprang to his feet. \"Fair enough!\" he bawled. \"I call Parr\nguilty. All who think like me, say aye!\"\n\n\"Aye!\"\n\n\"Aye!\"\n\n\"Aye!\"\n\nThey were all agreeing except Sadau, who looked shrunken and sad and\nfrightened. Shanklin smirked.\n\n\"All who think he should be killed as a murderer--\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" put in Varina Pemberton. \"If I'm chief, I'll draw the line\nthere. Don't kill him.\"\n\nShanklin bowed toward her. \"I was wrong to suggest that before a woman.\nThen he's to be kicked out?\"\n\nThere was a chorus of approving yells, and all save Sadau jumped up to\nlook for sticks and stones. Parr laid his hand on the club he had borne\nin the skirmish that day.\n\n\"Now wait,\" he said clearly and harshly, and the whole party faced\nhim--Sadau wanly, the girl questioningly, the rest angrily.\n\n\"I'm to be kicked out,\" Parr repeated. \"I'll accept that. I'll go. But,\"\nand the club lifted itself in his right hand, \"I'm not going to be\nrough-housed. I've seen it happen here, and none of it for me.\"\n\n\"Oh, no?\" Shanklin had picked up a club of his own, and grinned\nfiercely.\n\n\"No. Let me go, and I leave without having to be whipped out of camp.\nMob me, and I promise to die fighting, right here.\" He stamped a foot on\nthe ground. \"I'll crack a skull or two before I wink out. That's a\nsolemn statement of fact.\"\n\n\"Let him go,\" said Varina Pemberton again, this time with a ring of\nauthority. \"He wears that armor, and he'll put up a fight. We can't\nspare any more men.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Parr told her bleakly. He gave Shanklin a last long stare\nof challenge, then turned on his heel and walked away toward the\nthickets amid deep silence. Behind him the council fire made a dwindling\nhole in the blackness of night. It seemed to be his last hope, fading\naway.\n\nHe pushed in among thick, leafy stems. A voice hailed him:\n\n\"Hah!\"\n\nAnd a figure, blacker than the gloom, tramped close to him across a\nlittle grassy clearing.\n\n\"You! They drive you out?\" a thick, unsure voice accosted him.\n\nParr hefted his club, wondering if this would be an enemy. \"Yes. They\ndrove me out. I'm exiled from among exiles.\"\n\n\"Uh.\" The other seemed perplexed over these words, as though they stated\na situation too complicated. Parr's eyes, growing used to the darkness,\nsaw that this was a grotesque, shaggy form, one of the degenerate\noutcasts from the village. \"Uh,\" repeated his interrogator. \"You come to\nus. Make one more in camp. Come.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAmong tall trees, thickly grown, lay a throng of sleepers. Parr's\ncompanion led him there, and made an awkward gesture.\n\n\"You lie down. You sleep. Tomorrow--boss talk. Uh!\"\n\nSo saying, the beast-man curled up at the root of a tree. Parr sat down\nwith his back against another trunk, the club across his knees, but he\ndid not sleep.\n\nThis, plainly enough, was the outcast horde. It clung together, the\ngregariousness of humanity not yet winnowed out by degeneration. It had\na ruler, too--\"Tomorrow boss talk.\" Talk of what? In what fashion?\n\nThus Parr meditated during the long, moonless night. He also took time\nto examine once more his captured armor. Its metal plates, clamped upon\na garment of leatheroid, covered his body and limbs, even the backs of\nhis hands, as well as his neck and scalp. Yet, as he had decided before,\nit was no great protection against violence. As clothing it was\nsuperfluous on this tropical planetoid. What then?\n\nHe could not see, but he could feel. His fingers quested all over one\nplate, probing and tapping. The plate was hollow--in reality, two\nsaucer-shaped plates with their concave faces together. They gave off a\nmuffled clink of hollowness when he tapped them. When he shook the\narmor, there was something extra in the sound, and that impelled him to\nhold a plate close to his ear. He heard a soft, rhythmic whirr of\nmachinery.\n\n\"There's a vibration in this stuff,\" he summed up in his mind. \"What\nfor? To protect against what?\"\n\nThen, suddenly, he had it.\n\nThe greatest menace of the whole tiny world was the force that reversed\nevolution--the vibration must be designed to neutralize that force!\n\n\"I'm immune!\" cried Fitzhugh Parr aloud; and, in the early dawn that now\ncrept into the grove, his sleeping companions began to wake and rise and\ngape at him.\n\nHe gaped back, with the shocked fascination that any intelligent person\nwould feel at viewing such reconstructions of his ancestors. At almost\nthe first glance he saw that the newest evolutionary thought was\ncorrect--these were simian, but not apes. Ape and man, as he had often\nheard, sprang from the same common fore-father, low-browed,\nmuzzle-faced, hairy. Such were these, in varying degrees of intensity.\nNone wore clothes. Grinning mouths exhibited fanglike teeth, bare chests\nbroadened powerfully, clumsy hands with short, ineffectual thumbs made\nfoolish gestures. But the feet, for instance, were not like hands, they\nwere flat pedestals with forward-projecting toes. The legs, though\nshort, were powerful. Man's father, decided Parr, must have had\nsomething of the bear about his appearance ... and the most bearlike of\nthe twenty or thirty beast-men heaved himself erect and came slouching\nacross toward Parr.\n\nThis thing had once been a giant of a man, and remained a giant of an\nanimal. None of the others present were nearly as large, nor were any of\nthe men who had driven Parr forth. Six feet six towered this\nhair-thicketed ogre, with a chest like a drayhorse, and arms as thick as\nstovepipes. One hand--the thumb had trouble opposing the great cucumber\nfingers--flourished a club almost as long as Parr's whole body.\n\n\"I--boss,\" thundered this monster impressively. \"Throw down stick.\"\n\nParr had risen, his own club poised for defense. The giant's free hand\npointed to the weapon. \"Throw down,\" it repeated, with a growl as\nbearlike as the body.\n\n\"Not me,\" said Parr, and ducked away from the tree-trunk against which\nhe might be pinned. \"What's the idea? I didn't do anything to you--\"\n\n\"I--boss,\" said his threatener again. \"Nobody fight me.\"\n\n\"True, true,\" chorused the others sycophantically. \"Ling, he boss--throw\ndown club, you new man.\"\n\nParr saw what they meant. With the other community, the newest and\ntherefore most advanced individual ruled. In this more primitive\nsociety, the strongest held sway until a stronger displaced him. The\ngiant called Ling was by no means the most human-seeming creature there,\nbut he was plainly the ruler and plainly meant so to continue. Parr was\nno coward, but he was no fool. As the six-foot bludgeon whirled upward\nbetween him and the sky, he cast down his own stick in token of\nsurrender.\n\n\"No argument, Ling,\" he said sensibly.\n\nThere was laughter at that, and silly applause. Ling swung around and\nstripped bare his great pointed fangs in a snarl. Silence fell abruptly,\nand he faced Parr again. \"You,\" he said. \"You got on--\" And he stepped\nclose, tapping the plates on Parr's chest.\n\n\"It's armor,\" said Parr.\n\n\"Huh! Ah--ar--\" The word was too much for the creature, whose brain and\nmouth alike had forgotten most language. \"Well,\" said Ling, \"I want. I\nwear.\"\n\nHe fumbled at the fastenings.\n\nParr jumped clear of him. He had accepted authority a moment ago, but\nthis armor was his insurance against becoming a beast. \"It's mine,\" he\nobjected.\n\nSolemnly Ling shook his great browless head, as big as a coal-scuttle\nand fringed with bristly beard. \"Mine,\" he said roughly. \"I boss. You--\"\n\nHe caught Parr by the arm and dragged him close. So quick and powerful\nwas the clutch that it almost dislocated Parr's shoulder. By sheer\ninstinct, Parr struck with his free fist.\n\nSquare and solid on that coarse-bearded chin landed Parr's knuckles,\nwith their covering of armor plate. And Ling, confident to the point of\ninnocence because of his strength and authority, had neither guarded nor\nprepared. His great head jerked back as though it would fly from his\nshoulders. And Parr, wrenching loose, followed up the advantage because\na second's hesitation would be his downfall.\n\nHe hit Ling on the lower end of the breastbone, where his belly would be\nsoftest. Above him he heard the beast-giant grunt in pain, and then\nParr swung roundabout to score on the jaw again. Ling actually gave\nback, dropping his immense bludgeon. A body less firmly pedestalled upon\npowerful legs and scoop-shovel feet would have gone down. It took a\nmoment for him to recover.\n\n\"Aaaah!\" he roared. \"I kill you!\"\n\nParr had stooped and caught up his own discarded club. Now he threw it\nfull at the distorted face of his enemy. Ling's hands flashed up like a\nshortstop's, snatched the stick in midair, and broke it in two like a\ncarrot. Another roar, and Ling charged, head down and arms outflung for\na pulverizing grapple.\n\nParr sprang sidewise. Ling blundered past. His stooping head crashed\nagainst a tree, his whole body bounded back from the impact, and down he\nwent in a quivering, moaning heap. He did not get up.\n\nParr backed away, gazing at the others. They stood silent in a score of\nattitudes, like children playing at moving statues. Then:\n\n\"Huh!\" cried one. \"New boss!\"\n\nA chorus of cries and howls greeted this. They gathered around Parr with\nfawning faces. \"You boss! You fight Ling--beat 'im. Huh, you boss!\"\n\nAt the racket, Ling recovered a little, and managed to squirm into a\nsitting posture. \"Yes,\" he said, \"you boss.\"\n\nWith one hand holding his half-smashed skull, he lifted the other in\nsalute to Parr.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt took time--several days--but Parr got over his first revulsion at the\nbestial traits of his new companions. After all, in shedding the wit and\ngrace of man, they were recovering the honest simplicity of animals. For\ninstance, Ling was not malicious about being displaced, as Shanklin had\nbeen. Too, there was much more real mutual helpfulness, if not so much\ntalk about it. When one of the horde found a new crop of berries or\nroots or nuts, he set up a yell for his friends to come and share. A\ncouple of oldsters, doddering and incompetent gargoyles, were fed and\ncared for by the younger beast-men. And all stood ready to obey Parr's\nslightest word or gesture.\n\nThus, though it was a new thought to them, several went exploring with\nhim to the north pole of their world. The journey was no more than\nfifteen miles, but took them across grassy, foodless plains which had\nnever been worth negotiation. Parr chose Ling and another comparatively\nintelligent specimen who called himself Ruba. Izak, the mild-mannered\none who had first met and guided Parr on the night of his banishment\nfrom the human village, also pleaded to go. Several others would have\njoined the party, but the deterioration of legs and feet made them poor\nwalkers. The four went single file--Parr, then big Ling, then Ruba, then\nIzak. Each carried, on a vine sling, a leaf-package of fruit and a melon\nfor quenching thirst. They also carried clubs.\n\nThe plain was well-grassed, as high as Ling's knuckled knee.\nOccasionally small creatures hopped or scuttled away. The beast-men\nthrew stones until Parr told them to stop--he could not help but wonder\nif those scurriers had once been men. The hot sun made him sweat under\nhis plate-armor, but not for all the Solar System would he have laid it\naside.\n\nThey paused for noonday lunch in a grove of ferny trees beyond the\nplain, then scaled some rough lava-like rocks. In the early afternoon\nthey came to what must be the asteroid's northern pole.\n\nLike most of the asteroids, this was originally jagged and irregular.\nMartian engineers in fitting it artificially to support life, had roughed\nit into a sphere and pulverized quantities of the rock into soil. Here,\nat the apex, was a ring of rough naked hills enclosing a pit into which\nthe sun could not look. Ling, catching up with Parr on the brow of the\ncircular range, pointed with his great club.\n\n\"Look like mouth of world,\" he hazarded. \"Dark. Maybe world hungry--eat\nus.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" agreed Parr. The pit, about a hundred yards across and full of\nshadow, looked forbidding enough to be a savage maw. Izak also came\nalongside.\n\n\"Mouth?\" he repeated after Ling. \"Mmm! Look down. Men in there.\"\n\nThere was a movement, sure enough, and a flare of something--a torch of\npunky wood. Izak was right. Men were inside this polar depression.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Parr at once, and began to scramble down the steep,\ngloomy inner slope. Ling grimaced, but followed lest his companions\nthink him afraid. Ruba and Izak, who feared to be left behind, stayed\nclose to his heels.\n\nThe light of the torch flared more brightly. Parr could make out figures\nin its glow--two of them. The torch itself was wedged in a crack of the\nrock, and beneath its flame the couple seemed to tug and wrench at\nsomething that gleamed darkly, like a great metal toadstool at the\nbottom of the depression. So engrossed were the workers that they did\nnot notice Parr and his companions, and Parr, drawing near, had time to\nrecognize both.\n\nOne was Sadau, who would have remained his friend. The other was Varina\nPemberton. In the torchlight she looked browner and more vigorous than\nwhen he had seen her last.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" he called to them.\n\nAbruptly they both snapped erect and looked toward him. Sadau seized the\ntorch and whirled it on high, shedding light. Varina Pemberton peered at\nthe newcomers.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"it's you. Parr. Well, get out of here.\"\n\nParr stood his ground, studying the toadstool-thing they had been\nlaboring over. It was a wheel-like disk of metal, set upon an axle that\nsprouted from the floor of rock. By turning it, they could finish\nopening a great rock-faced panel near by....\n\n\"Get out,\" repeated the girl, with a hard edge on her voice.\n\nParr felt himself grow angry. \"Take it easy,\" he said. \"Your crowd\nbooted me out, and I'm not under your rule any more. Neither can this be\nsaid to be your country. We've as much right here as you.\"\n\n\"Four of us,\" added Ruba with threatening logic. \"Two of you. Fight,\nuh?\"\n\n\"Parr,\" said Sadau, \"do as Miss Pemberton tells you. Leave here.\"\n\n\"And if I don't?\" temporized Parr, who felt the eagerness of his\nbeast-men for some sort of a skirmish.\n\nVarina Pemberton took something from her belt and pointed it. A brittle\nreport resounded--_whick_! And an electro-automatic pellet exploded\nalmost between Parr's feet, digging a hole in the rock. He jumped back.\nSo did his three comrades, from whose memories had not faded the\nknowledge of firearms.\n\n\"The next shot,\" she warned, \"will be a little higher and more carefully\nplaced. Get out, and don't come back.\"\n\n\"They win,\" said Parr. \"Come on, boys.\"\n\nThey retired to the upper combing of rock, with the sun at their backs.\nThere Parr motioned them into hiding behind jagged boulders. Time\npassed, several hours of it. Finally they saw Sadau and Varina Pemberton\ndepart on the other side of the hole.\n\n\"Good,\" rumbled Ling. \"We follow. Sneak up. Grab. Kill.\"\n\n\"Not us,\" Parr ruled. \"No war against women, Ling. But we'll go down\nwhere they were working, and see what it's all about.\"\n\nThey groped their way down again. At the bottom of the pit-valley they\nfound the metal projection, so like a mighty steering wheel. Sadau's\ntorch lay there, extinguished, and Parr still carried a radium lighter\nin the pocket of his shabby shorts. He made a light, and looked.\n\nThe big panel or rock, that had been half-open, was closed. As for the\nwheel, it had been bent and jammed, by powerful blows with a rock. He\ncould not budge it, nor could the mighty Ling, nor could all of them\ntogether.\n\n\"They were inside this asteroid,\" decided Parr, half to himself. \"Down\nwhere the Martians planted the artificial gravity-machinery. Having been\nthere, they fixed things so nobody will follow them. Only blasting rays\ncould open up a way, and those would probably wreck the mechanism and\nsend air, water and exiles all flying into space. All this she did.\nWhy?\"\n\n\"Why what?\" asked Izak, not comprehending.\n\n\"Yes, why what?\" repeated Parr. \"I can only guess, Izak, and none of my\nguesses have been worth much lately. Let's go home, and keep an eye\npeeled on our neighbors.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Martians had come again--the same space-patroller, repaired, and\ntwice as many hands and a new skipper. They carried no Terrestrial\nexile--for once their errand was different.\n\nFour of them, harnessed into erect human posture, armed and armored,\nstood around the evening fire in the central clearing of the village now\nruled by Varina Pemberton. The skipper was being insistent, but not\nparticularly deadly.\n\n\"We rrecognize that fourr dead among you will ssettle forr one dead\nMarrtian,\" he told the gathered exiles. \"The morre sso ass you assurre\nme that the man rressponssible hass been drriven frrom among you. But we\nmake one demand--the arrmorr taken frrom the body of the dead Marrtian.\"\n\n\"I am sorry about that,\" the chieftainess replied from her side. \"We\ndidn't know that you valued it. If we get it back for you--\"\n\n\"Ssuch action would rreflect favorrably upon you,\" nodded the Martian\nskipper. \"Get the arrmorr again, and we will rrefrrain frrom punitive\nmeassurress.\"\n\n\"Why do you want that armor so much?\" inquired Shanklin boldly. He\nhimself had never thought of it as worth much. He was more satisfied to\nhave the knife, which he now hid behind him lest the Martians see and\nclaim. But the skipper only shook his petalled skull.\n\n\"It iss no prroblem of yourrss,\" he snubbed Shanklin. And, to Varina\nPemberton: \"What time sshall we grrant you? A day? Two dayss?... Come\nbefore the end of that time and rreporrt to me at the patrrol vessel.\"\n\nHe turned and led his followers back toward the plain where the ship was\nparked.\n\nNight had well fallen, and silence hung about the vessel. Only a\nrectangle of soft light showed the open hatchway. The Martian officer\nled the way thither, ducked his head, entered--\n\nPowerful hairy hands caught and overpowered him. Before he could collect\nhimself for resistance, other hands had disarmed him and were dragging\nhim away. His three companions, narrowly escaping the same fate, fell\nback and drew their guns and ray throwers. A voice warned them sharply:\n\n\"Don't fire, any of you. We've got your friends in here, and we've taken\ntheir electro-automatics. Give us the slightest reason, and we'll wipe\nthem out first--you second.\"\n\n\"Who arre you?\" shrilled one of the Martians, lowering his weapon.\n\n\"My name's Fitzhugh Parr,\" came back the grim reply. \"You framed me into\nthis exile--it's going to prove the worst day's work you Martian\nflower-faces ever did. Not a move, any of you! The ship's mine, and I'm\ngoing to take off at dawn.\"\n\nThe three discomfited hands tramped away again. Inside the control room,\nParr spoke to his shaggy followers, who grinned and twinkled like so\nmany gnomes doing mischief.\n\n\"They won't dare rush us,\" he said, \"but two of you--Ling and Izak--stay\nat the door with those guns. Dead sure you can still use 'em?... You,\nRuba, come here to the controls. You say you once flew space-craft.\"\n\nRuba's broad, coarse hand ruffled the bushy hair that grew on his almost\nbrowless head. \"Once,\" he agreed dolefully. \"Now I--many thing I don't\nremember.\" His face, flat-nosed and blubber-lipped, grew bleak and\nplaintive as he gazed upon instruments he once had mastered.\n\n\"You'll remember,\" Parr assured him vehemently. \"I never flew anything\nbut a short-shot pleasure cruiser, but I'm beginning to dope things out.\nWe'll help each other, Ruba. Don't you want to get away from here, go\nhome?\"\n\n\"Home!\" breathed Ruba, and the ears of the others--pointed, some of\nthose ears, and all of them hairy--pricked up visibly at that word.\n\n\"Well, there you are,\" Parr said encouragingly. \"Sweat your brains, lad.\nWe've got until dawn. Then away we go.\"\n\n\"You will never manage,\" slurred the skipper from the corner where the\nMartian captives, bound securely, sprawled under custody of a beast-man\nwith a lever bar for a club. \"Thesse animalss have not mental powerr--\"\n\n\"Shut up, or I'll let that guard tap you,\" Parr warned him. \"They had\nmental power enough to fool you all over the shop. Come on, Ruba. Isn't\nthis the rocket gauge? Please remember how it operates!\"\n\nThe capture of the ship had been easy, so easy. The guard had been well\nkept only until the skipper and his party had gone out of sight toward\nthe human village. Nobody ever expected trouble from beast-men, and the\nwatch on board had not dreamed of a rush until they were down and\nsecure. But this--the rationalization of intricate space-machinery--was\nby contrast a doleful obstacle. \"Please remember,\" Parr pleaded with\nRuba again.\n\nAnd so for hours. And at last, prodded and cajoled and bullied, the\ndegenerated intelligence of Ruba had partially responded. His clumsy\npaws, once so skilful, coaxed the mechanism into life. The blasts\nemitted preliminary belches. The whole fabric of the ship quivered, like\na sleeper slowly wakening.\n\n\"Can you get her nose up, Ruba?\" Parr found himself able to inquire at\nlast.\n\n\"Huh, boss,\" spoke Ling from his watch at the door. \"Come. I see white\nthing.\"\n\nParr hurried across to look.\n\nThe white thing was a tattered shirt, held aloft on a stick. From the\ndirection of the village came several figures, Martian and Terrestrial.\nParr recognized the bearer of the flag of truce--it was Varina\nPemberton. With her walked the three Martian hands whom he had warned\noff, their tentacles lifted to ask for parley, their weapons sheathed at\ntheir belts. Sadau was there, and Shanklin.\n\n\"Ready, guns,\" Parr warned Ling and Izak. \"Stand clear of us, out\nthere!\" he yelled. \"We're going to take off.\"\n\n\"Fitzhugh Parr,\" called back Varina Pemberton, \"you must not.\"\n\n\"Oh, must I not?\" he taunted her. \"Who's so free with her orders? I've\ngot a gun myself this time. Better keep your distance.\"\n\nThe others stopped at the warning, but the girl came forward. \"You\nwouldn't shoot a woman,\" she announced confidently. \"Listen to me.\"\n\nParr looked back to where Ruba was fumbling the ship into more definite\naction. \"Go on and talk,\" he bade her. \"I give you one minute.\"\n\n\"You've got to give up this foolish idea,\" she said earnestly. \"It can't\nsucceed--even if you take off.\"\n\n\"No if about it. We're doing wonders. Make your goodbyes short. I wish\nyou joy of this asteroid, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Suppose you do get away,\" she conceded. \"Suppose, though it's a small,\ncrowded ship, you reach Earth and land safely. What then?\"\n\n\"I'll blow the lid off this dirty Martian Joke,\" he told her. \"Exhibit\nthese poor devils, to show what the Martians do to Terrestrials they\nconvict. And then--\"\n\n\"Yes, and then!\" she cut in passionately. \"Don't you see, Parr?\nRelations between Mars and Earth are at breaking point now. They have\nbeen for long. The Martians are technically within their rights when\nthey dump us here, but you'll be a pirate, a thief, a fugitive from\njustice. You can cause a break, perhaps war. And for what?\"\n\n\"For getting away, for giving freedom to my only friends on this\nasteroid,\" said Parr.\n\n\"Freedom?\" she repeated. \"You think they can be free on Earth? Can they\nface their wives or mothers as they are now--no longer men?\"\n\n\"Boss,\" said Ling suddenly and brokenly, \"she tell true. No. I won't go\nhome.\"\n\nIt was like cold water, that sudden rush of ghastly truth upon Parr. The\ngirl was right. His victory would be the saddest of defeats. He looked\naround him at the beast-men who had placed themselves under his\ncontrol--what would happen to them on Earth? Prison? Asylum? _Zoo_?...\n\n\"Varina Pemberton,\" he called, \"I think you win.\"\n\nThe hairy ones crowded around him, sensing a change in plan. He spoke\nquickly:\n\n\"It's all off, boys. Get out, one at a time, and rush away for cover.\nNobody will hurt you--and we'll be no worse off than we were.\" He raised\nhis voice again: \"If I clear out, will we be left alone?\"\n\n\"You must give back that armor,\" she told him. \"The Martians insist.\"\n\n\"It's a deal.\" He stripped the stuff from him and threw it across the\nfloor to lie beside the bound prisoners. \"I'm trusting you, Varina\nPemberton!\" he shouted. \"We're getting out.\"\n\nThey departed at his orders, all of them. Ling and Izak went last,\ndropping the stolen guns they had held so unhandily. Parr waited for all\nof them to be gone, then he himself left the ship.\n\nAt once bullets began to whicker around him. He dodged behind the ship,\nthen ran crookedly for cover. By great good luck, he was not hit. His\nbeast-men hurried to him among the bushes.\n\n\"Huh, boss?\" they asked anxiously. \"Ship no good? What we do?\"\n\nHe looked over his shoulder. Somewhere in the night enemies hunted for\nhim. The beast-folk were beneath contempt, would be left alone. Only he\nhad shown himself too dangerous to be allowed life.\n\n\"Goodbye, boys,\" he said, with real regret. \"I'm not much of a boss if I\nbring bullets among you. Get back home, and let me haul out by myself. I\nmean it,\" he said sternly, as they hesitated. \"On your way, and don't\nget close to me again--death's catching!\"\n\nThey tramped away into the gloom, with querulous backward looks. Parr\ntook a lonely trail in an opposite direction. After a moment he paused,\ntingling with suspense. Heavy feet were following him.\n\n\"Who's coming?\" he challenged, and ducked to avoid a possible shot. None\ncame. The heavy tread came nearer.\n\n\"Boss!\" It was Ling.\n\n\"I told you to go away,\" reminded Parr gruffly.\n\n\"I not go,\" Ling retorted. \"You no make me.\"\n\n\"Ling, you were boss before I came. Now that I'm gone from you--\"\n\n\"You not gone from me. You my boss. Those others, they maybe pick new\nboss.\"\n\n\"Ling, you fool!\" Parr put out a hand in the night, and grabbed a mighty\nshaggy arm. \"I'll be hunted--maybe killed--\"\n\n\"Huh!\" grunted Ling. \"They hunt us, maybe they get killed.\" He turned\nand spat over his shoulder, in contempt for all marauding Martians and\ntheir vassal Earth folk. \"You, me--we stay together, boss.\"\n\n\"Come on, then,\" said Parr. \"Ling, you're all right.\"\n\n\"Good talk!\" said Ling.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey went to the other side of the little spinning world, and there\nnobody bothered them. Time and space were relative, as once Einstein\nremarked to illustrate a rather different situation; anyway, the village\nunder Varina Pemberton numbered only eight men--Parr and Ling could\navoid that many easily on a world with nearly nine hundred square miles\nof brush, rock and gully.\n\nIn a grove among grape-vines they built a shelter, and there dwelt for\nmany weeks. Ling wore well as a sole friend and partner. Looking at the\nbig, devoted fellow, Parr did not feel so revolted as at their first\nglimpse of each other. Ling had seemed so hairy, so misshapen, like a\ntroll out of Gothic legends. But now ... he was only big and burly, and\nnot so hairy as Parr had once supposed. As for his face, all tusk and\njaw and no brow, where had Parr gotten such an idea of it? Homely it\nwas, brutal it wasn't....\n\n\"I get it,\" mused Parr. \"I'm beginning to degenerate. I'm falling into\nthe beast-man class, closer to Ling's type. Like can't disgust like. Oh,\nwell, why bother about what I can't help?\"\n\nHe felt resigned to his fate. But then he thought of another--Varina\nPemberton, the girl who might have been a pleasant companion in happier,\neasier circumstances. She had banished him, threatened him, wheedled him\nout of victory. She, too, would be slipping back to the beast. Her body\nwould warp, her skin grow hairy, her teeth lengthen and sharpen--Ugh!\nThat, at least, revolted him.\n\n\"Look, boss,\" said Ling, rising from where he lounged with a cluster of\ngrapes in his big hand. \"People coming--two of 'em.\"\n\n\"Get your club,\" commanded Parr, and caught up his own rugged length of\ntough torn-wood. \"They're men, not beast-men--they must be looking for\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"Couldn't come to a better place to find it,\" rejoined Ling, spitting\nbetween his palm and the half of his cudgel to tighten his grip. The two\nof them walked boldly into view.\n\n\"I see you, Sadau!\" shouted Parr clearly, for there was no mistaking the\ngaunt, freckled figure in the lead. \"Who's that with you?\"\n\nThe other man must be a new arrival. He was youngish and merry-faced as\nhe drew closer, with black curly hair and a pointed beard. There was a\nmental-motive look to him, as if he were a high grade engineer or\nmachinist. He wore a breech-clint of woven grasses, and looked\nexpectantly at Parr.\n\n\"They aren't armed,\" pointed out Ling, and it was true. The pair carried\nsticks, but only as staffs, not clubs.\n\n\"Parr!\" Sadau was shouting back. \"Thank heaven I've found you--we need\nyou badly.\" He came close, and Parr hefted his club.\n\n\"No funny business,\" he challenged, but Sadau gestured the challenge\naside.\n\n\"I'm not here to fight. I say, you're needed. Things have gone wrong,\nawfully. The others got to feeling that there was no reason to obey a\nwoman chief, even though Miss Pemberton has many good impulses--\"\n\n\"I agree to that,\" nodded Parr, remembering the girl's many strange\nbehaviors. \"I daresay she wasn't much of a leader.\"\n\nSadau did not argue the point. \"Shanklin, as the previous newest man,\ngrabbed back the chieftaincy,\" he plunged ahead. \"Those other fools\nbacked him. When I tried to defend Miss Pemberton, they drove me out. I\nstumbled among the others--that crowd you used to capture the\npatroller--and got a line on where you were. I came for help.\"\n\nOne phase had stuck in Parr's mind. \"You tried to defend that girl. They\nwere going to kill her?\"\n\n\"No. Shanklin, as chief and king, figures he needs a queen. She's not\nbad looking. He's going to marry her, unless--\"\n\nParr snorted, and Sadau's voice grew angry. \"Curse it, man, I'm not\ncasting you for a knight of the Table Round, or the valiant space-hero\nwho arrives in the nick of time at the television drama! Simplify it,\nParr. You're the only man who ever had the enterprise to do anything\nactual here. You ought to be chief still, running things justly. And it\nisn't justice for a girl to be married unofficially to someone she\ndoesn't like. Miss Pemberton despises Shanklin. Now, do you get my\npoint, or are you afraid?\"\n\nIt was Ling who made answer: \"My boss isn't afraid of anything. He'll\nstraighten that mess out.\"\n\nParr glanced at the big fellow. \"Thanks for making up my mind for me,\nLing. Well, you two have talked me into something. Sadau, shake Ling's\nbig paw. And,\" he now had time to view the stranger at close hand,\n\"who's this with you?\"\n\nThe man with the black curls looked genially surprised. \"You know me,\nboss. I'm Frank Rupert.\"\n\nParr stared. \"Never heard of you.\"\n\n\"You're joking. Why, I almost got that Martian patroller into space,\nwhen Miss Pemberton--\"\n\nParr sprang at him and caught him by his shoulders. \"You were\nRuba--Rupert! It's only that you didn't talk plain before. What's\nhappened to you, man?\"\n\nSadau hastily answered: \"The degeneration force is obviated. Reversed.\nAll those who were beast-men are coming back, some of the later arrivals\ncompletely normal again. Haven't you noticed a change in this big husk?\"\n\nParr turned and looked at Ling. So that was it! Day by day, the change\nhad not been enough to impress him. As Ling had climbed back along his\nlost evolutionary trail, Parr had thought that he himself was slipping\ndown....\n\n\"Don't stop and scratch your head over it, Parr,\" Sadau scolded him.\n\"It'll take a lot of explaining, and we haven't time. You said you'd\nhelp get Miss Pemberton out of her jam. Come on.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was like the television thrillers, after all, Parr reflected. But\nSadau was right on one count--Parr didn't quite fill the role of the\nspace-hero. He had neither the close-clipped moustache nor the gleaming\ntop boots. But he did have the regulation deep, unfathomable eyes and\nthe murderous impulse.\n\nIt was just after noon. Shanklin, as chief-king, had also set up for a\npriest. In the center of the village clearing, he stood holding a sullen\nand pale Varina Pemberton by one wrist, while he recited what garblings\nof the marriage service he remembered. His subordinates were gathered to\nleer and applaud. They did not know of the rush until it was all over\nthem.\n\nParr smote one on the side of the neck and spilled him in a squalling\nheap. Sadau, Ling and Rupert overwhelmed the rest of the audience, while\nParr charged on into Shanklin. His impact interrupted the words \"I take\nthis woman\" just after the appropriate syllable \"wo\". As once before\nwith Ling, Parr dusted Shanklin's jaw with his fist, followed with a\ndigging jab to the solar plexus, and swung again to the jaw. Shanklin\ntottered, reeled back, and Parr closed in again.\n\n\"I always knew I could lick you,\" Parr taunted. \"Come on and fight,\nbridegroom. I'll raise a knot on your head the size of a wedding cake.\"\n\nShanklin retreated another two paces, and from his girdle snatched the\nMartian knife. He opened its longest blade with a snap. Varina Pemberton\nscreamed. Then, above the commotion of battle, sounded the flat smack of\nan electro-automatic. Shanklin swore murderously, dropping his knife.\nHis knuckles were torn open by the grazing pellet.\n\nAnd Parr, glancing in the direction whence the shot came, realized with\nsavage disgust that the space-hero had come after all. There stood a\ngorgeous young spark in absolutely conventional space-hero costume, not\nforgetting the top-boots or the close-clipped moustache. Parr moved\nback, as if to allow this young demigod the center of the stage.\n\nBut Varina Pemberton was not playing the part of heroine. Instead of\nrushing in and embracing, she set her slim hands on her hips. She spoke,\nand her voice was acid: \"It's high time you came, Captain Worrall. I did\nmy part of the job weeks ago.\"\n\nThe handsome fellow in uniform chuckled. \"We weren't late, at least.\nWe've been hiding here for some time--saw what this fellow I shot loose\nfrom the knife had in mind whole hours ago. But we also saw these\nothers,\" and he nodded toward Parr. \"They sneaked up in such a\nbusiness-like manner, I hadn't the heart to spoil their rescue.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOther uniformed men--hands of the Terrestrial Space Fleet--were coming\ninto view from among the boughs. They, too, were armed. Ling walked\nacross to Parr, a struggling captive under each arm.\n\n\"What are these strangers up to, boss?\" he demanded. \"Say the word and\nI'll wring that officer's neck. I never liked officers, anyway.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Parr bade him. Then, to the man called Captain Worrall: \"Just\nwhat are you doing here?\"\n\n\"This asteroid,\" replied Worrall, \"is now Terrestrial territory. We're\nfortifying it against the Martians. War was declared three weeks ago,\nand we made rocket-tracks for this little crumb. It's an ideal base for\na flanking attack.\"\n\nParr scowled. \"You're fortifying?\" he repeated. \"Well, you'd better shag\nout of here. There's a power--not working just now, but--\"\n\n\"No fear of that,\" Varina Pemberton told him. She was smiling.\n\n\"I can explain best by starting at the start. Recently we got a report\nof what the Martians were doing out here. We realized that Earth must\ntake care of her own, these poor devils who were being pushed back into\nanimalism. Also, with war inevitable--\"\n\n\"You aren't starting at the start,\" objected Parr. \"Where do you fit\ninto all this? You're no soldier.\"\n\n\"Oh, but she is,\" Captain Worrall said, offering Parr a cigarette from a\nplatinum case. \"She's a colonel of intelligence--high ranking. Wonderful\njob you've done, Colonel Pemberton.\"\n\nShe took up the tale again: \"If the reverse-evolution power could be\ndestroyed, this artificially habitable rock in space would be a great\nprize for our navy to capture. So I took a big chance--got myself framed\nto a charge of Murder on Mars, and was the first woman ever sent here. I\nknew fairly accurately when war would break out, and figured I had\nmonths to do my work in. That captured armor gave me the clue.\"\n\n\"All I knew was that it gave off a vibration,\" nodded Parr.\n\n\"Exactly. Which meant that the evolution-reverse was vibratory, too. I\nconfided in Sadau, and he and I pieced the rest of the riddle together.\nThe vibrator would be inside, where nobody would venture for fear of\njamming the gravity-core--but we ventured--\"\n\n\"And shut it off!\" cried Parr.\n\n\"More than that. We reversed it, started it again at top speed to cause\na recovery from the degeneration process. Clever, these Martians--they\nfix it so you can shuttle to and fro in development. Already the higher\nbeast-men are back to normal, like Rupert there, and the others will be\nall right, soon.\"\n\n\"You had every right to chase me off at the end of a pistol,\" said Parr.\n\"I might have gummed the works badly.\"\n\n\"You nearly did that anyway,\" Varina Pemberton accused. \"Fighting,\nraiding, stirring up the Martians who might have put a crimp in my plans\nany moment--but, being the type you are, you couldn't do otherwise. I\nrecognized that when I gave you the protective armor.\"\n\nHe gazed at her. \"Why didn't you keep it for yourself?\"\n\n\"No,\" and she shook her tawny head. \"I figured to win or lose very\npromptly. But you, armored against degeneration, might live after me and\nbe an awful problem to the Martians. Remember, I didn't make you give it\nback until I had done what I came to do.\"\n\nWorrall spoke again: \"Colonel, these exiles must stay until all effects\nof the degeneration influence is gone. They'll figure as civilians, with\ncolonists' rights. That means they must have a governor, to cooperate\nwith the military garrison. Will that be you?\"\n\nShanklin dared to speak: \"I am chief--\"\n\n\"Arrest that man,\" the girl told two space-hands. \"No, Captain. But I'm\nsenior officer, and I'll make an appointment. By far the best fitted\nperson for the governorship is Fitzhugh Parr.\"\n\nThe other exiles had pressed close to listen. Sadau, the diplomatic, at\nonce set up a cheer. Ling added his own loyal bellow, and the others\njoined in. Parr's ears burned with embarrassment.\n\n\"Have it your way,\" he said to them all. \"We'll live here, get normal,\nand help all we can. But first, what have we to eat? We've got guests.\"\n\n\"No, governor, you're the guest of the garrison,\" protested Captain\nWorrall. \"Come aboard my ship yonder. I'll lend you a uniform, and\nyou'll preside at the head of the table tonight.\"\n\n\"Varina Pemberton,\" Parr addressed the girl who had caused so much\ntrouble and change on the little world of exile, \"will you come and sit\nat my right hand there?\"\n\n\"A pleasure,\" she smiled, and put her arm through his.\n\nEverybody cheered again, and both Parr and the girl blushed.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Devil's Asteroid, by Manly Wade Wellman\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DEVIL'S ASTEROID ***\n\n***** This file should be named 22538.txt or 22538.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/2/5/3/22538/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Graeme Mackreth and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
