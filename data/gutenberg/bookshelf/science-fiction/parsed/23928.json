A catalyst failed briefly in its task, then\nresumed, but the damage had been done. A vital circuit remained\nincomplete, a neural path blocked. Time passed....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn embryo gathered in a metal womb, controlled potential building to\ntitanic birth. A thread of wire melted under a breath of energy and\na tiny, glowing light winked out. A rodentlike maintenance robot,\nscurrying to an unimportant repair task, saw no warning signal and\ncrossed a control panel from behind at the moment that a relay closed\nautomatically. Obliterated, the robot only briefly interfered with the\nproper functioning of the machine, but the damage had been done. For\na split second at a critical moment, a mighty engine reacted out of\ncontrol. Time passed....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn embryo jerked convulsively under a frightful onslaught, strained for\nlife in a crowded womb while the mother's convulsions threatened it with\ndeath. The convulsions passed, the mother lived, the womb emptied, but\nthe damage had been done, a record had been cut. Time passed....\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThere are logical limits for any pretense--limits beyond which the\npretense becomes demonstrably absurd. Mother-love enabled the woman\nHelen Douglas to evade logic up to and beyond the point of absurdity,\nbut even mother-love is not proof against the turmoil of the\nsubconscious. A survival factor pried up a safety valve, and Helen\nDouglas found herself suddenly face to face with the admission that\nshe had so desperately suppressed. She reacted with a terrible storm\nof weeping that shook the bed and was watched with complete disinterest\nby the dry-eyed imbecile beside her. Two-year-old Timothy Wainwright\nDouglas, congenital idiot, couldn't care less. It was nothing to him\nthat his mother had at last faced the ugly knowledge that her only child\nshould have been born dead. It was less than nothing to him that she\ncould almost find it in her heart to wish him dead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRelease from the crowded womb brought no immediate awakening from the\nlong sleep of gestation, for a sense of identity comes only slowly to\nthe very young, the new-born. He did not realize that his intellectual\nawakening, gradual as it seemed to him, was really extraordinarily\nrapid, a matter of only two or three weeks after birth. To him, with no\nframe of reference, it was a time of mystery that was not recognized as\nmystery. At first there was only Warmth and Hunger, for which he had no\nnames but which he recognized by their presence or absence. There was\nthe satisfying of Hunger, Sleep, and the return of Hunger. Had he been\ninclined to philosophy at that tender age, he would have considered the\ncycle a complete and satisfying one. In a few days, however, there were\nlonger periods between the satisfying of Hunger and the coming of\nSleep--a sort of comfortable, full-stomached reverie that was the\nbeginning of the end.\n\nWith astounding precocity of which he was completely unaware, he began\nrapidly sorting and cataloguing noises that had previously conveyed no\nmeaning. He now learned to associate certain sounds with certain sources\nand place others under tentative listings while awaiting further data.\nSmells received the same treatment as noises and often the two could be\nrelated. A certain smell and a certain gobbling sort of noise were often\nfollowed by a frightening swoop as he was lifted, but his eyes were not\nyet focused and could give him little information as to the manner or\npurpose of lifting.\n\nIn his fourth week of life he began to be troubled. His little handful\nof memories centered around a growing and not entirely subjective\nawareness of himself as an individual. Clearly, life could be divided\ninto \"me\" and \"not me.\" To have arrived at that conclusion twenty-odd\ndays after birth was an incredible achievement. His mind was quick,\nbut it could not reason further without a basis for logic, a system\nof reference, learned data from which further data could be inferred.\nThere was uneasiness in him, but no warning of danger; only a stirring\nof memory that tried to rise to the conscious level. Wonderingly he\nprodded the memory a little, as an inquisitive child pokes at a\nslow-burning firecracker or a wary pup approaches its first cat. Like\nthe sharp crack of a squib, the quick spit of a cat, the memory erupted\nand flung him back on his mental heels.\n\nHe felt a sensation that he knew was death though he had no name for\nit, and his immature defenses sprang into action, tried in vain to block\nthe memory, to thrust Death back into its Pandora's Box. He impeded the\nflood by an infinitesimal fraction of a second, and then full awareness\ncame and with it an understanding of the terrible thing that had\nhappened, the thing that he?--yes, _he_ had done.\n\nThe fledgling identity of \"me\" and \"not me\" sank forever into\nsubmergence, never to rise again.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nWhen he was almost four, Timmy spoke his first words. He said clearly\nand matter-of-factly, \"I want that one, Helen.\"\n\nHis mother's mouth slowly opened while her face turned gray with shock.\nThe buckling of her knees in cataplexy forced her to sit down heavily\non a kitchen chair not cushioned for such descents, but she was hardly\naware of it. Timmy, seated on the kitchen floor and surrounded by\nhalf-grown pups owned by a neighbor, screwed his head around to glance\nat her impatiently over his shoulder.\n\n\"I want that one,\" he repeated confidently, and pointed to the most\nill-proportioned of an ill-conceived litter of mongrels. Helen raised\nshaking hands to her face, and screamed.\n\nThe quick scrape of a chair in the living room and the sound of hasty\nfootsteps glissading on the throw-rug in the hall heralded the approach\nof Timmy's father. The doorway filled with flexing muscles that flexed\nin vain, but somewhat at a disadvantage by the strictly static tableaux.\nHelen sat at the table, her staring eyes fixed on the child who looked\nback in blank astonishment. Even the pups were motionless, having\ncowered in alarm at Helen's scream.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Timmy's father asked.\n\nHis voice was a spur rudely galvanizing her into action, into an awkward\nconvulsion that landed her on her knees beside Timmy. She gripped his\nlittle shoulders with fierce intensity and almost glared into his eyes.\n\n\"Say it again, Timmy--_say it again_!\" She looked around wildly.\n\"He spoke, Jerry, as clear as anyone! He said 'I want that one,' and\npointed! Timmy ... darling ... _angel_ ... say it again!\"\n\nTimmy's face twitched uncertainly, giving the effect of a confused play\nof expressions. For a moment he looked as though he would cry, but then\nthe crumpled, puckered lines magically smoothed. The eyes, dull and\nblank, stayed dry. He made a senseless noise and slobbered in doing so.\nHis jaw was slack, his chin wet.\n\nJerry felt slightly sick.\n\n\"Get up, Helen.\" He lifted her somewhat roughly to her feet, overrode\nher babble. \"You're frightening the ... the child.\"\n\n\"He _talked_, Jerry ... you heard him! _Didn't_ you hear him!\"\n\n\"Come in the living room and sit down.\" She was half-carried, her\nprotests ignored. There was a certain grim determination in his actions\nas he made her comfortable. \"Now we're going to face it, Helen. It can't\nbe put off. Timmy was heart-wrenching enough by himself, but I've had to\nwatch the change in you in the past few months. You're getting ... well,\nwe'll call it hysterical. I could cut off my arm for saying this, honey,\nbut, if we keep Timmy any longer, you'll just have a breakdown, that's\nall!\"\n\nShe moaned softly, rocking back and forth in misery's timeless attitude.\n\"I can't help it, Jerry. I ... just ... can't ... help it.\"\n\n\"I know, I know. So I'm making the decision for both of us, here and\nnow, and on my head be it. Timmy will have to be put away this week,\npermanently.\"\n\n\"No!\" Her wail was more of anguish than of protest.\n\n\"Yes! I can't stand coming home from work day after day to find you've\nmanufactured some new evidence to delude yourself there's hope for him.\nOne day he took the spoon in his hand to feed himself, another day he\nfocused his eyes and looked around the room as though he was really\ntaking everything in--\"\n\n\"You said you believed me!\"\n\n\"So I did--at first. So I'd sit around all evening watching him,\n_willing_ him to do something intelligent. And did he? No. Hon, I don't\nwant to be unkind to you or to him, but I can't stand seeing you delude\nyourself, making yourself sick. We've both taken more than is good for\nus. We're at the end of our rope. We've got to face it now and do what\nshould have been done long ago. It's not as if Timmy will miss us. He\ndoesn't even know us, after four years!\"\n\nShe gathered her forces, shut her eyes tight as if to deny his\nexistence. \"It's no use, Jerry, I won't do it. I am _not_ deluding\nmyself. I heard him speak. If that was illusion, it was so real to me\nthat you may as well put us both away together!\"\n\n\"Hysterical hallucinations--\"\n\n\"Jerry, don't say that again. _I heard him say 'I want that one,\nHelen!_'\"\n\n\"You see! Already you're embroidering what you heard! Now he's\ncalling his mother by her first name. Honest, Helen, can't you see how\nridiculous you're being? If you'd thought he said da-da or goo-goo\nI could have gone along with the gag, but to have him jump the whole\nlearning stage and come out with a complete, concise, explicit little\nsentence ending familiarly with your Christian name--\"\n\n\"I don't know how he did it, but he _did_ it.\"\n\nJerry rose from his seat beside her, his lips tight. \"I can't honestly\nsay I love my own child, hard as I've tried. But I can say that I love\nhis mother. If I have to bankrupt myself to give Timmy proper care in\nan institution, then I'll do just that, and do it gladly. But I won't\nfalsely place his interests above yours. He was born an idiot and he\nwill live and die an idiot. Nothing can change that. Timmy goes, and\nthat's final.\"\n\nHe clamped his mouth shut and turned toward the kitchen where he knew\nhis son sat, a stupid lump that couldn't even crawl of its own volition.\nThe stupid lump stood firmly in the doorway, an uncertain, placating\nsmile on its lips, a pup cradled in the slender arms.\n\n\"Jerry? I want _this_ one.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nBy Timmy's sixth birthday, only his parents' adamant attitude had\nsaved him from becoming a side show. Once the initial household uproar\nhad died down and some degree of general sanity been restored, Helen\nand Jerry had another bad fright. They had grudgingly allowed Clancey,\nthe family sawbones, to call in a psychologist friend, Philip Warwick.\nThe combined efforts of these two to find an explanation for Timmy\nresulted in complete chaos, with Timmy suffering violent and erratic\nlapses into complete idiocy for varying lengths of time. Standard tests\nmeant nothing, unless mutually exclusive results could be accepted as\nmeaningful in themselves. At length, Timmy suffered a relapse of such\nduration that the parents became panic-stricken and quietly rebelled.\nIt was obvious that he needed an atmosphere of peace and quiet.\nConfusion, excitement, or the concentrated attention of several adults\nsimply threw him into a relapse.\n\nThe break came when Clancey called at the house and found it empty,\ndeserted. He traced them to a new neighborhood where they had rented a\nhouse with a peaceful, walled garden. They were not pleased to see him,\nbut Clancey was a psychologist of sorts himself and a working agreement\nwas arrived at whereby he and Warwick could drop in frequently as\nfriends and quietly observe Timmy, chatting with him when they could\nwin his confidence and submitting him to whatever tests they could\nadequately disguise. But under pain of permanent excommunication from\nthe Douglas menage they were not to discuss him with outsiders in such\na way as to either identify him or draw attention to him. Timmy was to\nbe allowed to set his own pace under their obliquely-watching eyes.\nHe was not to become a subject for newspaper comment, for the speculation\nof strangers, or for the heated discussion of learned gentlemen calling\neach other liars in six syllables. For Timmy was something new under\nthe sun.\n\nTwo years of observation gave Clancey and Warwick an impressive file of\nnotes on him, and they were prone to sit after office hours with it on\nthe desk between them, giving it morose glances. They were not happy.\nSometimes, as now, they concluded an evening visit by sitting in\nClancey's or Warwick's car parked outside the Douglas fence, holding an\nimpromptu post-mortem on an intellectual corpse that had come to life\nin complete defiance of all the rules. They didn't notice the stealthy\nmovement of one of the fence-boards, nor the small form that snaked\nthrough the shadows of concealing shrubbery until it was near the open\nwindow of the car.\n\n\"Take word-association, Clancey. I had a few minutes with him this\nevening before you got here, so I started him on a 'game' where we took\nturns in saying a word and trying to guess what the other would reply.\nI believe he thought I was rather a simpleton and needed humoring.\nAnyway, I tried him with 'home' and got a delayed response. It's\nhappened before. Apparently the concept of home is tied to some deeper\ndisturbance.\" There was a slight, uneasy movement from the listening\nfigure. \"Well, linking home and family, on my next turn I shot 'mother'\nat him. There was an immediate flash of confusion in his eyes and again\na delayed response before he blurted 'Mom.' Something else had been on\nthe tip of his tongue, but he choked it back and selected what seemed\nto him a more suitable reply.\n\n\"Now, we both know from two years' systematic observation that Helen is\nas well-balanced a mother as you're likely to find. I'm quite sure she\nhas no unsuspected bad habits or traits that are leaving sensitive spots\nin Timmy's mind, making him flinch at the association, nor is there some\nlong-standing or unresolved conflict in their relations. Yet 'home' and\n'mother' both invoke blocks that inhibit response until consciously\novercome, or invoke images that he wishes to conceal lest they betray a\nsecret. I doubt very much whether anything that happened in his first\nfour years could have left a deep impression on the completely imbecilic\nmind he is _assumed_ to have had then. That leaves the past two years--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    _(Confirmation) Game/not game.... Should data have predicted\n    test? (Indecision) Possibly ... review later. So much to learn\n    ... confusion inevitable.

You suggest he selected,\ndeliberately, what seemed an appropriate response to 'mother.' Did you\ntake the next logical step and try 'father?'\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And did he anticipate it?\"\n\n\"I'm sure he did. I see what you mean ... fairly sharp reasoning for a\nsix-year-old supposed to be mentally retarded. When I shot 'father' at\nhim he came back promptly with 'male-Douglas' almost like one word.\"\n\n\"Got the sex and identity right. What's wrong with that?\"\n\n\"There's nothing 'wrong' or 'right' about it. I was hoping for some clue\nas to how his mind works. Maybe I got it, but I don't know what to do\nwith it. I didn't expect a calmly objective cataloguing of the old man\nas a 'male-Douglas.'\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    _(Surprise) Where is error? Semantics? Sociology? Colloquial\n    nuance? (Decision) Reject further word-games._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"If that's a clue, Phil, you can have it.\" Clancey hauled a notebook\nfrom his pocket and held it up. \"Open this thing anywhere--anywhere at\nall. It'll open at an unanswered question. At the age of roughly three\nand one-half, a congenital idiot suddenly displays flashes of alert\nintelligence. For forty-two months that child was content to sit on his\nfanny and vegetate. Never crawled, never spoke, never played, seldom\neven focused his eyes. Then one day his mother sees him study some\nalphabet blocks with every appearance of curiosity. Awareness! For the\nfirst time!\n\n\"Later, he suddenly reaches out his hand and piles the blocks in\na neat stack. Purposeful activity and perfect muscular control! No\ntrial-and-error, no baby hesitation with hand poised--just a sudden\nassured, controlled action. Mama leaps for joy, junior relapses into\nidiocy, and no one--including me--really believes mama when she says it\nhappened. This sort of thing goes on for several months--brief, erratic\nflashes of extraordinary intelligence, considering the subject. Then, a\nchild who has never spoken a single word says clearly and politely,\n'I want that one, Helen,' and a child who has never crawled puts his\nfeet under him and stands up steady as a rock. You tell me, Phil--how\ndid he do it?\"\n\n\"Don't look to me for an answer. I'm only a lousy fifth-rate psychology\nteacher, as of the day you brought Timmy into my life. And the curse of\nFreud be on you for _that_ kindly act of professional assassination. The\nanswer is obvious, of course ... Timmy didn't and couldn't do what we've\nseen him do with our own wide-open, innocent eyes. We are the victims of\na cunning hoax.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    _(Amusement) Difficult to experiment unobserved. Action too\n    precipitate/no choice. (Affection/laughter) \"The world is so\n    people.\" (Chill) Danger! Madness!_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"How does any child learn to speak?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Mainly by hearing others. Maybe Timmy learned the same way. Maybe he\nlistened, absorbing the meaning and sound of words, trying them out\nin the silence of his otherwise vacant little noggin. Maybe his mind\nawakened gradually to the realization that it was a prisoner in a\nparalyzed organ, strait-jacketed by blocks or short circuits. Maybe he\nspent his forty-two months of vegetating driving against those blocks\nuntil he partially broke them down and could speak. Maybe.\"\n\n\"And without ever having shaped his lips or tongue to intelligent\nsounds, he speaks fluently at the first try?\"\n\n\"Why not? Any kid that will start out by addressing its parents chummily\nas 'Helen' and 'Jerry' and act naively surprised at the reaction,\nobviously has rules of its own.\"\n\nThey ruminated in silence for a moment.\n\n\"It's too easy to talk vaguely about blocks and short circuits, Clancey.\nHow do you account for his completely erratic progress? Totally\nunpredictable, with alternating periods of complete idiocy and high\nintelligence?\"\n\n\"Not totally unpredictable.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"At least three things suggest a pattern. One is that his relapses,\nthough erratic, are becoming ever shorter in duration and more widely\nseparated.\"\n\n\"Yes, they are infrequent now and quickly ended.\"\n\n\"The second is that his grasp of the social pattern in which he\nlives--his environment, in all its subtleties--is constantly improving.\"\n\n\"Right again. At the age of six he can in many ways match a bright lad\ntwice his age. Not in the subtleties, though--I disagree there. You can\ngive him a simple or even a not-so-simple explanation of something he\nhears on the radio, dealing with it as a general theme in sociology,\nand he seems to grasp the broad outline with little difficulty, but in\ntrivial matters of social behavior and human relations he's frequently\nuncertain, as likely as not to pull a howling bloomer. Seems unusually\nbaffled and exasperated by some of the social mores he runs into, such\nas the many tabu subjects for conversation, or taking your clothes off\nwhenever or wherever you feel inclined to. Poor Helen. She tries to\nexplain and he keeps doggedly after her with ruthless logic, obviously\ntrying hard to understand, and ... you know ... it's surprising how few\nreally sound, logical reasons there are for half the accepted\nconventions that rule our lives.\n\n\"He's pinned me down several times to the conclusion that a certain\nconvention exists solely because people can't be trusted to behave\nrationally without restraining rules. It's rather a dismaying conclusion\nwhen it's dragged out in the open like that, and it seems to horrify\nhim. An ordinary kid learns by experience and accepts the rules with\nsporadic rebellion, but our boy acts as if they were beyond\ncomprehension. And I think they are ... to him.\n\n\"The first crime drama he happened to see on TV turned him white as\na sheet, and when he stuck his nose out the gate a few days later and\nwatched some neighborhood kids playing cowboys and Indians with cap\npistols, he was sick on the grass. Explaining the 'glamour' of the early\nwest made it worse. He drew back from me as though I were contagious.\nI had the feeling that he _pitied_ me. I wonder, sometimes, whether he\nmakes any real sense at all out of what is said to him. He's very slow\nto interpret the shades of expression possible in voice and face. I feel\nthat potentially he has an exceptional mind, but the great difficulty is\ncommunication.\"\n\n\"Like pulling his leg. It's too easy to be fun.\"\n\n\"Exactly, unless the little so-and-so is pulling ours, which I sometimes\nsuspect.\" Phil winced a little and rubbed his hand across his forehead.\n\"Getting a headache. Well, what's this third item you had in mind?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I can't pin it down, but I have a feeling there's a fairly obvious\nphysical factor linking the periods of relapse.\"\n\n\"Physical tiredness?\"\n\n\"No ... the contrary, perhaps. At the start he got himself overtired\npretty often, as though he overestimated his endurance, but it didn't\nseem to do him any harm. But if he awakens early or unexpectedly, there\nmay be an appreciable delay before he orients himself. Then he comes to\nwith a snap.\"\n\n\"Shock? Confusion of any sort?\"\n\n\"Confusion, certainly. He didn't last five minutes when they tried\nhim in school, you remember. Howled for his dog, then sat on the floor\nand dribbled. The confusion of being chucked into a group of noisy,\naggressive six-year-olds was too much for him. You remember he recovered\ncompletely--almost instantly--when his mother packed him out of the\nschool.\"\n\n\"That reminds me of something else. I think that dog is some sort of a\nsymbol to him. Perhaps it has somehow become associated with security.\nTry this for size: his mind is struggling to free itself from its strait\njacket; the dog captures his attention at a critical moment; the mother\nscreams when he speaks, frightening him, but the dog comes reassuringly\nto his arms and subsequently--or did _he_ see it as a consequence?--his\nparents make much of him. In other words, at the start of his rational\nlife the dog is a friendly element and the parents a frightening one.\nThe details of the association drop soon enough from his conscious\nmemory, but not from his subconscious. When the dog is with him, he\nfeels secure. When they are separated--it was not allowed into school\nwith him, of course--his symbol is gone and he panics, much as an\nordinary child panics if it loses its mother in a crowd.\"\n\n\"Slick, but not convincing. It touches on another peculiarity, however\n... the way he wants that hound with him always, no matter where. Sleeps\nwith it on his bed, eats with it by his chair, even takes it to the\nbathroom--by-the-by, he acquired the dog and bowel-control at the same\ntime, if you recall--but does he _like_ the dog? He never pets it to\nspeak of. Plays with it sometimes in a clumsy, disinterested sort of\nway, but it's not the classic boy-dog relationship. If the dog is merely\na symbol, as you suggest--\"\n\n\"I didn't say 'merely' a symbol. If I'm right, an association as strong\nas this one could be devilish awkward and even dangerous, hooked to a\nhair-trigger mind like his. What if something happens to the dog before\nhis dependence or whatever can be broken? Dogs get run over, you know,\nand even their normal life span is short. Maybe we ought to try to break\nit up ... damn this headache.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    _(Regret/Despondency) Degraded to pain ... static/thick tongue.\n    (Resignation) Delay, delay, delay ... break conversation. Time\n    wrong._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You been bothered with headaches lately?\"\n\n\"Off and on--nasty sort of twinges. If I trusted myself with a\ncarpenter, I'd let you give me a check-up. Well, let's cut this short.\nWhat I was going to say ... let's see ... oh, since Timmy seldom pays\nany attention to the dog, why does the dog stick to him like a shadow?\"\n\nClancey grunted.\n\n\"That dog's no fool, stupid as he is. Clumsy, homely, and half-witted\nenough to sit on a tack for five minutes before he howled--I've seen\nhim do just about that--he knows when he needs a protector. If it\nweren't for Timmy, the hound would have been destroyed long ago as\nan act of mercy. Helen and Jerry are resigned to him, of course, for\nTimmy's sake, but have you noticed that the dog reacts much the same\nas Timmy if they get separated? Casts about at once for a way to\nrejoin him, and the longer he's delayed the more he panics. Maybe it's\na two-way switch--maybe Timmy and his dog are indispensable symbols to\neach other!\"\n\n\"You dream up any more lulus like that, you keep them to yourself.\nPsychopathic dogs I draw the line at. Clancey, there is only one\nconclusion to be drawn from these here solemn deliberations. Throw out\nthe textbooks and roll with the punches.\"\n\n\"Amen.\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\"There should be no deaths!\"\n\nPhil turned that one over in his mind, cautiously. A good deal of his\nattention was needed for the task of nursing his old car along the ruts\nof the dirt road, but the murmured exclamation impelled him to steal a\nglance at the boy sitting beside him. This was the spring of Timmy's\ntenth year--the sixth year of his friendship with \"Uncle\" Phil--and\nthose years had taught Phil more than he realized, if less than he had\nhoped. He knew, for example, that the peculiar vacancy of Timmy's\nexpression at the moment implied deep thought rather than the complete\nabsence of thought that it suggested. That was a curious characteristic\nthat always made the man a little uneasy. Timmy's face was sometimes\nradiantly, spontaneously expressive, the most sensitive of mirrors, and\nsometimes it was rather mechanically expressive, but it was only\nexpressive in a positive sense. In moments of abstraction or daydreaming\nthere was no faraway look, no frown of concentration. Only blankness.\n\n\"The world would get a trifle crowded, you know.\"\n\nTimmy leaped the gap easily to connect the two remarks, as Phil had\nthought he would. \"Oh, I didn't mean there should be no _death_. I was\nthinking of something else. That man they found dead in the bush\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"A man with a heart condition should never go hunting alone.\"\n\n\"Was it his heart, Uncle Phil?\"\n\n\"His heart and his head both, if you ask me. He had a bad heart, all\nright--I saw him have an attack once. You'd think a man like that would\nhave sense enough to avoid overexertion, but he lost his way and started\nchurning through swamp and brush in a straight line instead of looking\nfor the trail again. Must have acted like a moron, running until he\ndropped.\"\n\n\"Would panic make a man do that?\"\n\n\"It will make a man do any crazy thing imaginable, if he lets it get\nthe upper hand. There's only a few square miles of marsh and brush here,\nwith the town already crowding up against it. In a few years it will be\ndrained and the land used for industrial development and so on, then the\nfools will have to find some other way to kill themselves.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, every so often we have to turn out search parties and have a grand\nshivaree looking for some idiot who usually turns up dead. Drowned\nhimself in two feet of water, or run himself ragged, or even put a\nbullet through his head for no good reason. It's happened several times\nin the past few years, so the place is getting a bad name it doesn't\ndeserve. Even the search parties often get themselves balled up and mill\naround in circles, perfect examples of mass hysteria. Sometimes I get\nfed up with the human race.\"\n\n\"I ... didn't know. I mean, about the ... deaths.\"\n\nPhil laughed outright at the tragic tone.\n\n\"Oh, come now! Let's not be morbid about it! You wanted to drive out\nhere, remember.\"\n\n\"I still do, Uncle Phil. You and Dad were talking about how you used to\ncome out here every spring when you were kids, to collect specimens, and\nit sounded like fun.\"\n\n\"So it was ... in those days. This old dirt road leads well in toward\nthe center. I used to spend a whole day hiking along here with my dog,\njust rooting around and having a grand time. It's a pity we outgrow\nthe best things in life. Childhood scenes should be remembered, not\nrevisited. We can remember, but we can't recapture. A few years ago\nI wanted some nature photographs so of course I came out here, sure\nI'd get some beauties. I don't know. I started out in high spirits,\nrecognizing every rotted old stump along the way, but somehow it all\nturned to ashes. I lost interest and turned back without taking a single\nexposure--almost hating the place, in fact, as if it had let me down.\nStrange that a place I loved as a kid should seem so empty and\nuninviting now.\" He put on the brakes and looked around morosely.\n\n\"Don't you want to go any farther, Uncle Phil?\"\n\n\"What for? You can see how overgrown the road is getting. I'll be lucky\nif I can find a clearing to turn around. There's nothing of interest up\nahead, Timmy. The road dies out and then there's a couple of miles or so\nof swamp and flies. It's getting dusk, too--\"\n\n\"I'd like to get out for a minute.\"\n\n\"Oh. Well, O. K., but make it snappy.\"\n\nHe settled back listlessly as the boy climbed out, holding the door for\nthe dog to follow.\n\n\"Do you have to take that mutt ... never mind, go ahead.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe boy wandered off to the side of the road and Phil listened to the\nrustle of bushes, wondering at his own irritation. He felt ill at ease,\nanxious to be away. He started as Timmy came up beside him on the left\nof the car.\n\n\"That was quick.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" The boy was holding a spray of flowering shrub and his hand\npassed casually over the flowers in a light caress. \"Say, hasn't this\nflower got a sweet smell, Uncle Phil? Here, smell it.\"\n\n\"It's a pretty flower, Timmy, but that stuff has no perfume.\" He\naccepted the branch automatically, lifted it to his nostrils.\n\nTime stopped.\n\nHe thought he felt a thump against the side of the car, but the\nimpression faded before it was fully born. In a remote corner of his\nmind the ticking of his watch sounded as a cold, measured rhythm, a\nmetronome with delusions of syncopation. He sat motionless, his forearm\nresting on the steering wheel, the spray of blossoms caressing his\ncheek, his mind stunned by the anaesthetic he drew in with each breath.\nHe was as one lost in thought, his eyes open but unseeing, observing but\nnot interpreting.\n\nThere was no sense of duration, of the passage of seconds or minutes.\nThere was only a dream in which, suddenly, a gentle mind made its\npresence known. Concepts tapped lightly at his own mind and an automatic\nprocess of interpretation winnowed and equated until a gentle voice\nseemed to speak. The words were few, merely computed associations\nkeyed to understanding, and with them were perfectly and intimately\nsynchronized fragments of emotion and vision, softly washing over the\nsurface of his mind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    _(Urgency) Attend--attend! Challonari! Attend!_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn impression of convolutions drifted through his mind--a shape,\nperhaps, and a color. He felt no curiosity, and let the impression\ndrift. As a sunbather drowsing on a crowded beach, hearing the\nbackground hum of the crowd and now and then a more clearly spoken\nphrase, so he caught the edge of this communication. It was not for\nhim. A second mind entered ... _was_ it a mind? Yes, and yet very\ndifferent. It was strong, but limited--perhaps childlike, in some ways.\nAlive after a fashion, it was receptive of emotion up to a point and\neven capable of emotion--up to a point. It seemed an embryo mind, in\nsome ways well developed and in others with no potential whatever.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    (RELIEF) IDENTITY BLURRED ... KNOW/NOT KNOW.

There was an elusive sense of\ndisorientation, a feeling of something overlooked. There was the tag-end\nof a remembered grief. There was--\n\n\"You were right, Uncle Phil. They have no scent.\"\n\n\"What?\" He looked around blankly, saw Timmy tossing the spray aside.\n\"Oh ... there it is. I thought I ... uh ... forget what I was going to\nsay.\" Two voices that were not voices--a dream, a despairing cry. An\nelusive memory faded, faded. \"There's mud on your cheek, Timmy. Did you\nfall?\"\n\n\"No ... that is, yes.\" Timmy scrubbed his cheek industriously.\n\n\"Make up your mind. Hurt yourself?\"\n\n\"No, I'm all right.\"\n\n\"Well, whip around to the other side and hop in.\" Phil watched him in\nthe rear-view mirror and noted the hasty dab at moist eyes. It seemed\nlike a significant giveaway, but he couldn't imagine why. \"Get your mutt\nin and let's go.\"\n\n\"Come on, Homer.\" The boy settled himself with his dog between his feet,\nand Phil laughed, his good spirits returned. He turned the car without\nmuch trouble and they bumped back over the wagon ruts.\n\n\"Why do you call him Homer, Timmy?\"\n\n\"Well, on account of the Odyssey, you know.\"\n\n\"I see. Some day when I have a clear mind and a couple of hours to\nspare, you can explain the connection between Homer's Odyssey and a\nflea-bitten semi-airdale.\"\n\nThey rode in silence for a while, until the dirt road changed to\npavement. Phil let his thoughts wander idly, thinking of nothing in\nparticular. Scraps of this and that seemed to float to the surface and\ndrift out of reach before he could capture them, had he been interested\nin trying. One fragment somehow caught in an eddy and remained in sight\nlong enough to draw his attention.\n\n\"Challonari,\" he said, wonderingly, and almost ditched them as stabbing\npain shot through his temples. He held the wheel with one hand, the\nother clapped for a moment to his brow. \"Don't do that!\" he snapped\nangrily.\n\n\"W-what, Uncle Phil?\"\n\n\"Sorry, Timmy, I didn't mean you. I don't know who I meant ... or,\nrather, _what_ I meant, of course. I seem to be pretty confused tonight.\nI even startled poor old Homer with that swerve. Get his muddy feet off\nthe cushions, Timmy.\" Homer sank back obediently to his usual place\nbetween Timmy's feet, but his muzzle rested on the boy's muddied knees\nand his brown eyes regarded both of them at the same time. Apparently he\nwas not convinced that the upheavals were over.\n\n\"What does 'challonari' mean, Uncle Phil?\"\n\n\"Oh ... that. Just something that came to mind.\"\n\n\"But what does it mean?\"\n\n\"I don't really know, Timmy ... something about convolutions or a\nconvoluted shape, I think, but that's only part of it. There are\nconnotations of ... of intelligence? No ... ridiculous. How can you have\na convoluted intelligence? But a brain is convoluted and to a greater or\nlesser degree intelligent. The ... um ... the question of degree comes\ninto it, I think. A brain of limited intelligence, then, though damned\nif I know why I think of it as limited. Challonari ... challonari. It's\nnot English and it doesn't sound like a technical word, but I must have\nheard it in connection with something ... quite recently, too.\"\n\n\"Sort of rhymes with 'shivaree.'\"\n\n\"Only sort-of, Timmy. You wouldn't make a good poet.\nShivaree--challonari. I mentioned shivaree when we were talking about\npeople getting lost in the bush, didn't I? Did it have some connection\nwith that? But how?\"\n\n\"Maybe a sort of--mental trick?\"\n\n\"Mental association rings a bell. Mental ... no, it's gone ... wait.\nTeacher, trainer, instructor--a brain of limited intelligence would need\na teacher. Gentle teacher. Why gentle, for Pete's sake? But teacher and\npupil, that seems almost right. How much can one word mean? What am I\ntrying to recall, anyway? The meaning of a word? The _associations_\nconnected with a word? The association of ideas? Blast it, this is more\nthan tantalizing.\"\n\n\"Like when you wake up knowing you've had a dream, but you can't\nremember any of it?\"\n\n\"Uh ... yes, like a dream. A dream of--\" The blood drained from his\nface, leaving him gray and ashen. Timmy put out a hand in alarm, to\nsteady the wheel.\n\n\"Uncle Phil!\"\n\n\"It's all right, Tim. It ... it's all right. I had a thought there that\nkind of shook me.\" He relaxed with a shaky laugh, relief flooding his\nface once more with color. \"What a crazy thought! I could have sworn ...\nwell, never mind. But it shakes a man to learn what tricks his own mind\ncan play on him, all in an instant.\"\n\n\"What kind of tricks, Uncle Phil?\"\n\n\"Oh, no you don't. If you hadn't egged me on with so many questions,\nI'd have been spared a pretty nasty moment, you know that? Now let me\nconcentrate on driving for a change so I can get you home in time for\nsupper. O. K.?\"\n\n\"But ... oh, O.K.\"\n\n\"Don't sound so disappointed, chum. It's been a pleasant drive, even if\nnothing much happened.\"\n\n\"Yes, Uncle Phil. Even if ... nothing much happened.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpring changed to summer, and summer rolled into its final days. Phil\nwas in a gloomy frame of mind when Timmy's eleventh birthday came\naround.\n\nHe watched Timmy draw a deep breath and--without puffing out his cheeks\nas a child would do--neatly blow out the eleven candles on his cake.\nIt was an efficient, sprayless, perfectly-controlled operation, an\noperation carried out happily and in high spirits, and it depressed\nPhil. The \"party\" itself depressed him--a child's birthday party with\nno children present, unless you counted Timmy! Phil and Doc, Helen and\nJerry, and Homer, the latter gray muzzled and stiff in the joints. That\nwas the roster of the guests and it could almost be called the roster\nof Timmy's total acquaintances. His parents, his two friends, and a dog\nthat at its best had never seemed bright and now was obviously half-dead\nwith age. The boy was not normal, had no normal life, and gave no\nindication of ever being likely to take a normal role in life. He was\na \"disordered personality\" if one could take comfort in a tag, but the\ntrue nature, cause and cure of his divergence from \"normal\" would remain\nunknown so long as his parents were afraid of tampering--\n\n\"Did you make a wish, Timmy?\"\n\n\"Sure, Mom.\"\n\n\"Helen, honey--Tim knows that wishing when you blow out the candles is\nkid stuff.\"\n\n\"And what is he but an eleven-year-old kid?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"He's too smart to believe in wishing, honey. Smarter than his old man,\neh, Tim?\"\n\n\"I'll _never_ be as smart as you, Dad.\"\n\n\"That's my boy! But you don't kid me.\" Jerry turned to Phil and Clancey,\nfeigning indignation. \"You know what happened the other day? I brought\nhome an old design that I dug out of the files and wanted to look\nover--a helical gravity conveyer--and when Tim saw it spread out on the\ntable he said, 'That's the curve I was just reading about.' Now how did\nthat little so-and-so know enough to call it a curve? I figured he was\nbluffing and got him to show me where he read about it, and the brat\nshowed me all right--in one of my old college textbooks! Of course I\nonly had to ask a few questions to find out that the college texts are\nfar beyond him, but imagine him dipping into them on his own and getting\nanything out of them at all! How about that, young man? Explain\nyourself.\"\n\nTimmy hesitated, his eyes dark with uncertainty.\n\n\"You said I could,\" he blurted defensively. \"Remember? Remember I asked\nyou one day and you said--\"\n\n\"Your father isn't angry, Timmy,\" Helen laughed, hugging him. \"Honest,\nyou get worried about the darnedest things! He's _proud_ of you! Don't\nyou know paternal boasting when you hear it?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" The shadow lifted and he laughed sheepishly. \"I get it. It was\nnuance of idiom that threw me. Calling me a brat and a so-and-so was\naffectionate misdirection to conceal--\" he broke off at their\nexpressions. Helen darted a quick look around and came to his rescue\nagain.\n\n\"Timmy-chile, where you git these heah high-falutin' _ex_-pressions\nI'll never know. Hit shore ain't from you' low-talkin' pappy.\"\n\n\"Or from yo' low-comedian mammy. It's all right, son--you just sound\na bit bookish sometimes, that's all. Want some help with the dishes,\nHelen?\"\n\n\"You know darn well you'd divorce me if I said yes. You and Clancey take\nTimmy in the front room and let him teach you something. Phil's just\ncrazy to help with the dishes. Aren't you, Phil?\"\n\n\"The obvious answer is yes. O. K., let's go.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey piled the dishes, joking and chattering until the sound of laughter\nfrom the front of the house told them that the others were occupied,\nthen Helen put down the dish she was washing.\n\n\"Well, Phil?\"\n\n\"Am I supposed to know what that means?\"\n\n\"Phil, in plain language, is Timmy a ... a genius?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think so. He's unaccountably bright in many ways and just\nas unaccountably slow in others. I don't think genius comes into it at\nall.\"\n\n\"That's what I think, too. Timmy's no genius ... yet he does things that\nonly a genius-type could do.\"\n\n\"Don't exaggerate, Helen. A sharp youngster living a secluded life and\nstudying more than he plays may be years ahead of other kids who go to\npublic schools.\"\n\n\"He's farther ahead than you think, Phil. I have Timmy in the house with\nme all day, so maybe I know him better than Jerry does. He fooled Jerry\nwith that business of the college textbooks, but not me. I think that\nfor some reason Timmy doesn't want us to know how advanced he really is.\nI think he slipped up when he commented on that helical what's-it, then\ncovered his slip by pretending he'd only leafed through the texts and\npicked up a bit here and there. I know when that boy's fooling, and I\nknow he deliberately fluffed the questions Jerry put to him. Timmy's\njust plain lousy when it comes to dissembling, you know, as if it was\ncompletely foreign to him to lie. All right, all right, I know what\nyou're going to say--fond mama building mother's-intuition fantasy\naround only child.\n\n\"Well, I kept an eye on him after that and about a week later Jerry\nbrought home some calculus dealing with a new design he's developing. He\nran into trouble with it and sweated and swore for an hour, while Timmy\nsat and read and I kept peeking in the hall mirror that lets you see\ninto the front room from the kitchen. After a while Jerry left the room\nto look for some tables he wanted and Timmy slipped over and looked at\nhis work, made a single notation, then dived back to his book as Jerry\nreturned. Jerry started to sweat over the thing again, then suddenly did\na double-take. He made some erasures and in five minutes had the whole\nthing worked out, cursing himself for misreading a figure or something.\n\n\"Now don't tell me it was just a coincidence. Timmy hadn't seen that\nproblem before and it should have been miles over his head anyway, yet\nhe gave it a quick glance, spotted the error, changed the limits of an\nintegration and put Jerry on the right track. Just like that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhil carefully massaged a dry plate even drier.\n\n\"So I stagger back and gasp, 'I can't believe it!' or something insane\nbut appropriate. The disturbing thing to me is that I not only _can_\nbelieve it, I do believe it. Completely. I may as well tell you now\nwhat I haven't yet told anyone else, that I've been methodically\ntricking Timmy for some months past--in fact, ever since I began to\nsuspect that his knowledge of the sciences was, to say the least,\nunusual for a boy his age. I probably led him into making that slip with\nJerry, identifying the curve. By giving him the impression that any boy\nhis age would know far more chemistry, math and physics than is actually\nthe case, I tripped him into revealing that he himself knows a very\ngreat deal about them. Perhaps more than I do.\n\n\"I begin to suspect now that I didn't set my sights nearly high enough\nin leading him on, but God alone knows where he could have learned. On\nanything that could be related to the humanities he's very slow, but in\nthe physical sciences he's out of this world. His secluded life--unable\nto mix with other kids, go to shows, games, or do anything that gets\nhim into crowds--gives him a very limited background for understanding\nhis environment, leaves him unboyish. He doesn't understand people. I\nconstantly have the impression that he is anxious to do the right thing,\nbut is simply baffled by problems in human relations.\"\n\n\"I know. He looks at me sometimes as though he's just desperate to reach\nme somehow--a lonely, unhappy little soul. He gets plenty of affection\nfrom both of us, but it isn't the answer--it just isn't the answer.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Helen, do you love your son?\"\n\n\"Do I--! Well, now, really Phil--what kind of a question is that?\"\n\n\"A simple one. Do you love Timmy?\"\n\n\"Of course I do. He's very dear to me.\"\n\n\"_Do you love your son?_\"\n\n\"Now look here--! I told you.... Phil, what are you getting at?\"\n\n\"I'm wondering why you have no doubt that you love Timmy, but the\nquestion of whether you love your son confuses you and throws you on\nthe defensive. You react strongly, evade answering, take refuge in\nexclamations and unfinished sentences. A species of stuttering. Can it\nbe that you find it difficult to think of Timmy as your son? _Do you\ndoubt that he is your son?_ Here, sit down! I didn't think it would hit\nyou so hard.\"\n\n\"Phil, the only other moment like this in my life was when I first\nadmitted to myself years ago that Timmy was ... what he used to be.\nAn imbecile. Phil, it _can't_ be true! He _is_ my son! There's been\nno substitution, no--\"\n\n\"Easy, Helen, easy. I agree with you. I've checked back as fully as I\ncan, and I'm sure there's been no trickery of any sort. Timmy was born\nto you eleven years ago, beyond a shadow of a doubt.\"\n\n\"But you've felt it too, haven't you? He's sweet and lovable in his\nfunny, confused way, talking like a comic-strip kid one minute and an\nencyclopedia the next--so empty and faraway sometimes, then loving and\naffectionate, as though to make up to us for being ... away. I'm sure he\nloves us, Jerry and I, as much as we love him, but I feel that we've\nfailed him, that he wants love but it can't reach him. I'll say it,\nPhil. I feel that he's not mine, that he's apart from us. Ridiculous,\nisn't it? I can't feel true kinship for my own child, much as he means\nto me. I feel better now that I've said it.\"\n\n\"I wish I could say the same, but I don't know that I feel any better\nfor adding one more question mark to a long, long line of them. Like\nyou, I sense a loneliness, a reaching out from Timmy for something I\ncan't give him no matter what I do, no matter how I try to understand.\nI watch him, and I think of that line '... a stranger and afraid ...'\nWhat is there that frightens him? Can it ... possibly ... be us?\"\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nIndian summer now lay softly upon the land.\n\nOn a wooded rise ten miles from the outskirts of the town, close by\na bluff overlooking the bushland, the tan walls of a small tent warmed\nto the late afternoon sun. Here and there beyond the bushland the\nsupper-smoke of scattered farms stood columned and motionless. The only\nsound on the still air was the harsh, labored breathing of the dying\nHomer.\n\nThe dog lay in the open near the edge of the bluff, his eyes closed, his\ncompanions seated nearby. Phil had brought Timmy on a week-end camping\ntrip that now appeared spoiled at the outset, for the short, steep climb\nup the bluff had unexpectedly proven too much for old gray-muzzle. His\ntrembling legs had barely carried him to the top before he collapsed,\nand now it was only a question of how long he must suffer before\nrelease. Phil glanced toward a .22 rifle lying with their gear. It would\nbe more merciful.\n\n\"No, Uncle Phil. He'll live until sundown at least. Let him have that\nmuch.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry this happened, Timmy, but now that it has I think we should\nmake it easier for him.\"\n\n\"You liked him, didn't you, Uncle Phil?\"\n\n\"Yes, Tim ... I'm a bit surprised to find that I really did. I can't say\nthat I'm much of an animal-lover, but in his way Homer was the perfect\nOld Faithful. No beauty and not very bright, you must admit, but he\nnever left your side. It won't seem the same.\"\n\n\"It won't _be_ the same, Uncle Phil.\" The boy raised his head to look\nover the distant bushland. His face was composed.\n\n\"Timmy, I hesitate to say this, but--\"\n\n\"I don't seem very upset about it?\"\n\n\"Well, yes. Did you really care much for Homer? You never paid any\nattention to him, never petted or played with him, just let him tag\nalong.\"\n\n\"I had no need to pet or play with him, and it was enough that he give\nme all of his attention. I should have spared a thought for him, his\nneeds and limitations, but it's too late now.\" The answering voice was\nsubtly changed from that of a boy, and strangely gentle. \"A dog's life\nis so short, hardly more than today and tomorrow. A breath or two, and\nit has begun and ended. When Homer dies he will be free, and I will no\nlonger exist.\"\n\nA chill slid over the man.\n\nWhat makes a voice? Air and musculature and tissue, but what more?\nA brain, a mind--a life. An accumulative series of reactive patterns\ncalled Life grows like a fragile crystal around a seeding impulse\nthat lacks a name acceptable to all, and the resulting structure is\ncalled \"personality\" or \"character\" and it influences what it touches\nin a manner peculiar to itself alone. Given the crude tools of a\nsound-producing mechanism it will, if it chooses and has the skill,\ndisclose some trifle of its own true nature. Phil heard words that\nshould have sounded idiotic coming from a boy, but they carried complete\nand instant conviction. Without elocutionary tricks, without fire and\noratory, the boy-voice had changed in timbre, acquired a quality that\ncould sway multitudes--the wild thought crossed Phil's mind that what\nit had acquired was the quality of complete sanity.\n\nA suspicion, planted deliberately and nurtured through the years,\nmatured on the triggered instant. Phil twisted around--alert, wary,\nalmost hostile, his eyes searching the somewhat bony young face. His\ngaze was returned steadily, with assured composure.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Who are you?\" he demanded bluntly. \"_What_ are you?\"\n\nTimmy laughed lightly, patently at ease.\n\n\"I am nothing, Phil. Nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Rot. You are flesh and blood, human, and were born to Helen and Jerry.\nWhat else?\"\n\n\"Is there more?\"\n\n\"Stop playing!\" Phil jumped up angrily, standing tall over the seated\nfigure. \"I've watched you for years. You've given yourself away\nrepeatedly.\"\n\n\"Ah, that 'advanced scientific knowledge' worried you badly, didn't it?\"\n\n\"I ... see. You revealed it deliberately. There are other things. Your\naversion to crowds--\"\n\n\"Their thinking confused me. They were dangerous.\"\n\n\"Were?\"\n\n\"After tonight, crowds will not matter.\"\n\n\"Because Homer will be dead?\"\n\n\"Because Homer will be dead, poor beast. My conscience will be dead.\"\n\n\"What on earth does that mean? I find it impossible either to doubt you\nor to think of you as a boy any longer.\"\n\n\"That is because your mind is filled with uncertainties, mine with\ncertainties. You have never before met anyone in whom certainty was a\nclear truth unquestioned on any level of any remote corner of the mind.\nI am such a one.\"\n\nPhil sat down helplessly. There was no point in standing. Whatever Tim\nwas, he was not going to be dominated by tricks.\n\n\"_What are you?_\"\n\n\"What can I say? I am a book that is being read, yet I am neither the\npages nor the printing on the pages, but only the meaning inherent in\nthe shapes and sequences of the letters that comprise the printing.\"\n\n\"Can't you give me a straight answer?\"\n\n\"It is difficult. You must think about what I say.\"\n\n\"But the ideas recorded in a book are merely--thoughts. They have no\ntangible existence.\"\n\n\"Nor have I.\"\n\n\"You're not a product of my imagination!\"\n\n\"Hardly.\"\n\n\"Are you giving me that line about 'All is Illusion'?\"\n\n\"No,\" the boy laughed spontaneously.\n\n\"Are you a mutant, a new evolutionary development?\"\n\n\"No, nor am I a machine or a monster.\"\n\n\"At least you're alive!\"\n\n\"That, I think, is a matter of definition.\"\n\n\"Then, for the third time, what are you! Stop baiting me!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTimmy's hand closed on Phil's--a firm, warm, dirty and somewhat\ncalloused boy's hand that was unquestionably flesh, blood and bone.\n\n\"Take it easy, Uncle Phil.\" Perhaps he had pushed too hard. The dancing\neyes veiled themselves a little and the intangible, indescribable\nmagnetism somehow faded. Phil, looking at him, was suddenly able to\nsee him and to think of him once more as Timmy, a boy with unusual\nqualities, but the same boy he had watched for years. He shook his head\nand felt somewhat bemused, as he had done once before.\n\n\"Look, let's get a fresh start, Tim, and stop going in circles.\"\n\n\"O. K., Uncle Phil.\" He was an eleven-year-old again, responding\nobediently.\n\n\"I've suspected for years that we didn't know the truth about you--that\nyou were something special, something new.\"\n\n\"Well--\" Tim appeared to consider it gravely. \"Yeah, I guess that's fair\nenough. I'm something new, all right.\"\n\n\"For years, then, you've been concealing something--something that\nshowed through whenever you made a slip.\"\n\n\"Wanna bet on how many of those slips were deliberate?\" Tim challenged,\nthen joined Phil's rueful laugh. \"Not all of them were, I got to admit,\nbut most of them.\"\n\n\"But today--apparently because Homer is dying--you've abandoned\npretense, come out in the open.\"\n\n\"Not all the way out, not yet. You've still got some shocks coming,\nUncle Phil.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt it, you young hoodlum. You were pretty overwhelming there\nfor a few minutes. But why all the mystery? Why not just tell me?\"\n\n\"You explained why.\"\n\n\"Overwhelming? Are you that terrific?\"\n\n\"I'm a humdinger, Bub. Think you can stand it now?\"\n\n\"I think the full blast would be better than any more of your 'gentle'\nhints.\"\n\n\"That's what you think.\" Come now, the first shock had been fairly\nneatly delivered and fielded after all, the concept of difference\nproposed, established and accepted. \"Well, here goes. You remember\nthat spray of flowers I handed you in the car that night?\"\n\n\"I've had my suspicions about them ever since.\"\n\n\"O. K.--now smell this pine cone.\"\n\nPhil looked at it with distrust.\n\n\"The thing that beats me is how I can be morally certain that pine cone\nis loaded, cocked, and ready to fire, and yet I take it,\" he let Tim put\nit in his hand, \"and smell it.\" He raised it to his nostrils, held his\nbreath for a moment, then gingerly sniffed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTime stopped.\n\nAll sense of duration was gone. Awareness drifted in formless\ninattention until a focal point, a mere nucleus of intellect, captured\nand held it. The nucleus strengthened, became an impression of\nidentity--not his own identity, nor any that he knew, but that of\nsome Other. From this other presence came insistently the warmth and\ngentleness of good will, an unreserved outpouring that sought to evoke\nan unreserved response.\n\nIsolation, the sanctum of the mind, took the assault, melting like an\nice-castle in the sun--but before the tempting surrender could become\nirrevocable alarms rang through his being and his mind gathered in on\nitself in confusion, holding its isolation intact and inviolate. Through\nthe opposing desires to yield and to withhold, to break barriers down\nand to raise them up, he detected from the Other a reaction both of pity\nand of revulsion. The pressure decreased. He knew then that what he\nyielded willingly would be accepted as sufficient, and no more be asked\nof him than he was capable of giving. Somehow, it was not a victory, but\na defeat.\n\nHe became aware that the private domain he had claimed for his own was\ntruly his own, a corridored, compartmented, dungeoned storehouse of\nfiled fancies and forgotten files. A tunneled, revetted, embrasured and\nbattlemented citadel filled with rusty armor and broken lances. A hock\nshop, a junkyard, a hall of distorting mirrors. A cemetery by the sea,\na peak of glory, a slough of despond. A radiant light, an encroaching\ndark, the sweetest of melody, the sourest of discord. A library of\ntrivia, museum of curiosa, sideshow of freaks, and shrine of greatness.\nIt was the lowering pendulum, the waiting pit, the closing walls. It was\nthe vaulting spirit, the gallant heart, the just and the kind and the\nmerciful. Withal, it was a haunted castle, perpetually besieged, the\ntowers soaring but the structure toppling. It was himself. His memories,\nhis experiences, his actions and reactions, his life. And it was\nappalling.\n\nA gentle prompting from the Other roused him from his self-immersion\nand for a moment he was all panic lest his secret had been observed.\nMechanisms he had not known he possessed slammed doors and banged\nshutters over windows in a fine frenzy, so that the Other winced and\nfell back, pleadingly, then softly and insistently drew near once more.\nHe realized that there was a purpose that must be served. Something was\ndesired from him. A voice. He tried, and the croak of a clogged throat\nwould have held as much meaning as the disharmonious thrust of thought\nthat began in chaos and ended in futility. Abashed, he would not try\nagain. Silence crept around him, the silence of isolation.\n\nThe most disarmingly hesitant, the most reassuringly inoffensive of\nthoughts touched as lightly as a breath and was accepted as his own.\nHe saw no cause to take alarm. Such an insignificant invasion was of no\nmore moment than the blowing of a grain of dust beneath a locked door.\n\nThe thought lay among his own, and moved like a thread through his own,\nand the elements that it drew together became the acceptance of an idea.\nSecure in his ill-kept citadel, he permitted a rapport so tenuous he\ncould break it at will, yet so strong that--\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nMemory tinged with homesickness tricked him into a sad reverie. That\nthey were only memories, these thoughts that rose up to slyly capture\nhis attention, was clear. He was under no illusion that he was\nexperiencing for the first time events that had long melted into the\npast, for they had a common-place familiarity that stamped them as\nscenes revisited, events relived, dear friends recalled to mind.\n\nHe stood alone at the edge of a meadow with the afternoon sun hot on his\nback and debated with Andra the advisability of transplanting a certain\nshrub from its chance-chosen place in the meadow to a position in their\nown gardens. Throughout their discussion he was conscious of little\ndrops of perspiration threading their way down his naked spine, and he\nlongingly savored the coolness of the stream-bank on which Andra\nreclined, a mile or two to the south.\n\nIn good-humored exasperation he commented enviously on woman's lot and\ndrew a dry rejoinder from a chance traveler on the highway to the north.\nHe joined in the general laugh at his own expense, hearing the sally\nrepeated and elaborated until it drifted out of conversational range. He\nwas tempted to follow it farther out of curiosity, but it was not good\nform to blanket local conversation for a mere whim. While his attention\nwas distracted, however, Andra became involved in an exchange of local\nrecipes with a newcomer to the district, a farm-wife whose husband had\nhad a fancy to try the westward farm lands. He joined the husband in a\nwry grimace at the loquacity of women, and simultaneously caught sight\nof a distant figure crossing a ridge somewhat north of him. The figure\npaused at the same instant, looked searchingly in his direction, then\nwaved on sighting him and strolled on. It was the traveler whose quip\nwas now being repeated miles away, far in advance of him. Andra showed\nno sign of running out of recipes and returning to shrubs. He sighed,\nand stood alone in the meadow....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe casual facility of memory bridged time and space without\ndisorientation. He was strolling in the evening with his bride, Andra's\narm linked with his for the added pleasure of physical contact. In the\nmanner of lovers they supplemented their thoughts with murmured words\nand sounds, thus sharing still another physical intimacy, for they were\nstill in that newly-mated condition where every manifestation of the one\nwas a source of delight and wonder to the other.\n\nThey paused momentarily by a vine-covered wall and he felt a cool frond\nreach out to caress his shoulder while a long tendril curled gracefully\nabout his forearm between the upper and the lower wrists. A few\nhundred-thousand years ago his remote ancestor would have recoiled\nviolently from the touch of what was then a strangler vine, but now he\ncasually disengaged the half-sentient tendril and with his mind caught\nthe faint, faint flicker of rudimentary awareness; thus far had nature\nprogressed with the vine, apparently reluctant to abandon a false start\ntoward mobility and intelligence for an unsuitable species. Or perhaps,\nAndra added, in nature's long-term view the experiment might still be\nconsidered promising. He shook his head.\n\nThe vine had learned peaceful ways that saved it from extinction,\ndrawing its food quietly from the earth while further developing a\nmobility of sorts, but eventually an impasse would be reached when\ngreater mobility would endanger nutrition. If the roots withdrew from\nthe soil, the vine would die--unless, he agreed slowly, echoing her\nshudder, the vine solved the dilemma by becoming again a carnivorous\nstrangler. Nature made unaccountable blunders and sometimes found\nstrange remedies, turning a blessing for one species into a curse for\nothers....\n\n[Illustration: HOMER]\n\nOn the same impulse they gazed at the night sky blazing with the heart\nof the galaxy spread around them, a galaxy as yet less than half mapped,\nonly a small fraction of its secrets known. Like many new-mates they\nplanned a leisurely, lengthy quest among the stars, a trip for which\ntheir mutual absorption peculiarly fitted them. After all, the\nadvancement of knowledge still required physical and intellectual\nresearch and the joy of living still demanded physical and emotional\nrelease, but there was one great barrier to space-travel.\n\nLeaving the great community of Challon ordinarily meant leaving an\nintensely experienced fellowship to endure a shattering isolation no\nless intensely felt, unless one were fortunate enough to be chosen for\nan exploration team. There was both comfort and common sense in the use\nof teams of the greatest numerical strength consistent with efficiency,\nbut the resources demanded by such teams limited the number that could\nbe fielded at one time. Consequently, private voyages in small craft\nwere not entirely uncommon among the hardy--or the temporarily\nself-sufficient, such as he and Andra. In a few days they would leave\nChallon behind, break for the first time the half-spiritual link with\nall their world, and voyage forth in the belief that their love for each\nother was alone enough to sustain them.\n\nAt the same instant the same doubt of self-worthiness crept into each\nmind and was read and stoutly answered by the other, while a dozen\nneighbors near and distant interrupted their own concerns to murmur\nencouragement and recall the doubts they, too, had felt and learned to\ndismiss. Reassured he led Andra back to the house, scarcely aware of the\nbackground bustle of other minds busy with other matters--nor, in fact,\ngreatly caring at that moment that others existed. The manner of love\nmay change, but not the manners of lovers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMemory surged after memory on waves of nostalgia and homesickness that\ntold their own story of why the memories had been long buried. Challon\nhad fallen away behind them and the strangeness of the cleavage from\ntheir fellows had dismayed them. In and around the spaceport center, a\nmultitude of the fellows they were never to see again had paused long\nenough in their own affairs to mesh thoughts in a final projection of\nencouragement that reached after the dwindling ship like a gesture of\nfarewell.\n\nA long, long farewell. A final farewell, unrecognized for the last\nparting that it was.\n\nThey had known from the experience of others that the first terrible\nsilence would be a hard thing to endure until the strangeness wore off.\nAt first they huddled like two children, driving their thoughts far into\nunanswering space in desperate disbelief that such utter silence could\nbe. Repelled by space, they turned to each other and found more complete\nunion than they had thought possible. From the depth of their union they\nfound the strength and growth and maturity to adapt, to endure, and to\nsurvive. The fear passed. The worst was over.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPlanetfall succeeded planetfall and the routine of their activities\nbecame smooth and practiced. As was the custom, they had been asked\nto obtain various items of information from sundry known but largely\nunexplored planets to help determine whether a later visit by a\nfull-scale exploration team would be advisable. In one system they made\na rapid instrumental survey of the only major continent on the only\ninhabitable planet, from a height of a hundred miles. In another, a\nskimming prospecting trip in a certain area confirmed a predicted rich\nore body. And at all times, of course--particularly when they left the\nknown systems behind and entered virgin territory--there was the\nChallonari to be trained and observed.\n\nThe Challonari--a part-organic, artificial brain--was one of the most\npromising recent developments of Challon science. It was also one of the\nmost debatable, for the Challonari was capable of independent thought in\nits limited fashion and yet had been devised solely as an instrument, a\ntool. It had no freedom of action, no physical independence, but it had\nchildlike emotions and--this was the damnable thing--a sense of identity\nand awareness of its creators as such. Thus the moral issue was raised.\nTo the Challon, the control or coercion of an independent intelligence\nwas a cardinal outrage. No greater sanctity existed than the sanctity of\nthe individual, for anything that prejudiced or restricted the right of\nthe individual to full mastery of himself was worse even than the\ndeliberate taking of life. It was murder of the ego. In a telepathic\nsociety, life itself could not be more precious than self-control.\n\nThe combined growth and manufacture of the Challonari had been stopped\nin horror when it was realized that their capabilities were greater than\nanticipated. An organic tool had not been created, but rather a ...\nwhat? When does a tool become an entity? If it is an entity, what right\nhave its makers to control it and use it as a tool? What right have they\nto--the thorniest issue of all--destroy it or otherwise put it aside\nwhen it is no longer required? Until these fundamental issues could be\nsettled, the handful of Challonari in existence must be cared for,\ntrained and observed as if they were backward children.\n\nThe main function of the Challonari on such a voyage as this was to\nsafeguard the ship and its immediate vicinity when on strange worlds.\nThis it accomplished by a swift, simplified appraisal of the offensive\ncapacities of any life form coming within its limited range. If their\nnatural weapons--claws, size, poison, fangs--rendered them potentially\ndangerous should the Mentor leave the ship, then the Challonari\nprojected into their minds a simple disinterest in the environs of the\nship, a reluctance to approach closer. If this failed, the reluctance\nimpulse became tinged with fear, the intensity of the fear increasing\nuntil the desired retreat occurred.\n\nIf the approaching unknown was of sufficient intelligence to identify\nthe disinterest-reluctance-fear impulse as a telepathic warning, then\nno further effort was made to turn it back, much less to hurl it back\nby force. That would have been unthinkable. An intelligent entity\napproaching the vessel would be welcomed and requested to identify\nitself, while notice of its approach would be delivered to the Challon\nMentor. Stranger and Challon would then inevitably join in friendly\ngreeting, for hostile suspicion was unknown among minds that lay open\none to the other. Among the handful of known life forms of sufficient\nintelligence to possess highly organized communications, no exception to\nthis natural rule existed. A meeting of minds was a meeting of friends.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMemory flinched, wavered, then flowed on into previously forbidden\nareas. The long outward voyage approached its turning point, its\ndisaster point. He did not know how or why it had happened. Perhaps\nin their mutual absorption he and Andra became careless. They had\nentered a planetary system, he recalled, and he had casually manipulated\nthe controls. His perceptive faculties detected a tiny spurt of flame\nsomewhere out of sight in the control bank, then the potent engines\nreacted out of control for a critical instant near planetary mass. The\nswift restoration of control only eased the crash, the automatics taking\nover a fraction too late after the fragile living tissue was smashed\nagainst the walls.\n\nThe return of consciousness told him at once that he was in the presence\nof death. Lying paralyzed and helpless in a pool of his own fluids, he\ncould see the jelly that had been Andra. He quietly resigned himself to\nthe death that might yet take days to come. It would be welcome.\n\nAn interregnum of shock followed in which his normal faculties were\nunseated, but with the passage of time he roused himself a little.\nWeakened as he was, his perception told him that the ship had buried\nitself deep in a swamp until it rested on bedrock. A dozen feet of muck\nand water lay over it. Even had they survived the crash they would have\nbeen helpless unless intelligent aid could be enlisted. He tried to\ndrive out his thoughts in a cry for help, but the strength was gone from\nhim. Within a radius of two miles there was no intelligent life, if any\nexisted on the planet.\n\nMore from habit than for any other reason, he awakened the Challonari.\nIt had survived the crash unharmed in its carefully cushioned\nimmobility, unaware that anything had transpired between the last\nplanetfall and this one. It immediately perceived that one of the\nMentors had gone, but before it could ask questions it was sternly\ndirected to concentrate its attention on the environs of the vessel.\nHaving thus distracted it from the presence of death, he sank back\ngratefully into a stasis of no-thought. Let time pass. It would bring\nsuccor or death, and he could do nothing more to hasten either one.\n\nThe Challonari roused him from his stupor on the third day after the\ncrash. It was disturbed, excited by something beyond its comprehension.\nWhile he had lain helpless and shriveling on a compartment floor\nsomething unusual had approached to within half a mile of the ship\nthrough the thick swamp vegetation. The life form had apparently\ndetected the first tendrils of thought from the Challonari and without\npreamble, as a natural defense, erected a savage mental shield. Pain and\nchaos that made coherent thinking difficult shook the artificial brain,\nbut since this evidently was not an intelligent life form, else it would\nnot have reacted in such a manner, the Challonari increased in intensity\nits fear-reluctance impulse. The mental shielding of the intruder blazed\nand crackled with increasing dissonance, radiating pain, fear and panic,\nbut no decipherable intelligent thought. It drew nearer, erratically,\napparently running, then swiftly lapsed into unconsciousness. That was\nwhen the bewildered Challonari had called him for aid.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe reached out wearily with his mind in automatic response, touched\nand hastily withdrew. Even when unconscious the strange being had an\naura of discordance about its mind. He would have shivered had he still\nbeen capable of physical reaction, for this was Unsanity, a thing he\nhad heard of but never before encountered. The Challonari caught his\nprotective thought and withdrew from contact, though not without a soft\nprotest, for it was inquisitive as any child. It, too, had heard of\nunsanity. Rare stresses or injuries now and again temporarily upset the\nbalance of the mind and required the healing touch of other minds. But\nunsanity was not something the Challonari could handle. It withdrew from\npossible infection, protestingly, fearful for its beloved Mentor but\nincapable of disobeying a clear command.\n\nHis own great pity for the sick creature outside conquered the\ninertia of approaching death and he rallied what mental forces he\nstill retained. He could not disregard suffering nor withhold whatever\naid it was in his power to give. Carefully, knowing something of what\nto expect, he probed the shield which was no true shield but an uproar\nof faulty coordination comparable to the disruptions coming from a\nbadly tuned radio. Wincing, as a musician winces when harsh, grating\ndissonance strikes his ear, he gingerly probed deeper and deeper,\nexploring this strange and fascinating structure that was unlike\nanything he had ever experienced. It was an extraordinary complexity\nthat spread before him--a maze, a labyrinth, a magnificent corruption\nof order and reason.\n\nHis first discovery he half expected. This was a mind of an intelligence\nlevel not far beneath his own, though fearfully hobbled by\nmisconceptions, superstitions, half-truths and fallacies. Life had\nbrutally mishandled and shackled--_life_ had? It was an adult of its\nspecies. How could its condition have existed undetected for so long?\nHe extended his explorations, and suddenly the incredible truth lay\nrevealed.\n\nThe dominant species on this planet was that theoretically possible\nbut logically improbable mistake of nature, a race of intelligent\nnontelepaths!\n\nFantastic as it was, there was no room for doubt. He was glad he had\nordered the Challonari to withdraw from contact. To accept the existence\nof such beings required a flexibility under shock, an adaptability of\nreasoning, that the limited Challonari could never rise to. It was like\na blow at the structure of the universe, but it raised a fascinating,\nage-old problem--what possible means of adequate communication could\nthey have?\n\nExcited despite the great discomfort of maintaining contact with this\nmind, he extended his explorations in search of the answer. A growing\nsuspicion was quickly confirmed beyond question, explaining at once\nthe sickening deformities of the wasted mind and the enigma of the\nalternative means of communication. There simply was no adequate\ncommunication! From that, all else stemmed. Each of these creatures,\nthese--he searched for the term--these \"Man\" as they called themselves,\nwas an island, an isolation of ego in a flood of dark fears that began\nlapping about them in early childhood and never ceased to rise. And\nthis, by its own conception, was a \"normal\" specimen! It had \"matured\"\nin a thoroughly competitive society instead of the completely\nco\u00f6perative society of the Challon. It had never really known or\nunderstood its own true nature, much less that of its fellows. It had\nnever truly known security, serenity, freedom, or peace. The eternal\nwonder was that it had progressed at all.\n\nDeeper and deeper he explored, tracing and classifying, filled with awe.\nThe incredible creature knew little or nothing of its own nervous system\nand would not have been aware of loss if the most essential portion of\nits brain had been surgically removed! Its life span was only a small\nfraction of what it should have been since, in its ignorance, it failed\nto repair itself as it had the innate ability to do. And yet, what an\nunbelievable treasury lay locked and sealed here. Only long study could\nrender this infinite honeycomb intelligible, even to a Challon. Nothing\nlike this had ever been known.\n\nMingled horror and profoundest admiration grew at what he found, but the\ncreature began to awaken. With a deft skill he planted a suggestion,\nthen hastily withdrew from contact before the impossible discord of\nmental cacophony became unbearable. The creature rose, wondering at its\nprevious panic, and moved away from the vicinity of the vessel that now,\nabove all else, it must never discover.\n\nThat was the first problem to be faced.\n\nBy learning what he had, the heaviest duty and the greatest moral\nobligation his race had ever borne was laid upon him. The last secret of\nthese \"Man\" made effective action imperative. Although he him self was\ncrushed beyond hope of survival, somehow his new knowledge and _all that\nit implied_ must survive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnobtrusive, physical reduction of the ship to completely unrecognizable\ndebris might have to be accomplished eventually, but it certainly was\nnot immediately possible. However, perception told him that the heavy\nvessel was already hidden beneath silt and stagnant water. It would\nbe safe for a while from accidental discovery. The Challonari was\nself-sustaining and could survive untended for years, if necessary,\nserving to keep the area clear of wild life that might draw hunters\nof the dominant species dangerously near.\n\nThere remained, then, the problem of providing a substitute for his own\npersonal survival. Here, the prospect seemed hopeless. The requirements\nwere a continuance of understanding, together with both the will and the\nability to act as necessary. Theoretically, he could have forcefully\ntaken possession of the body and mind of any suitable subject, but the\nmere thought of such a violation was impossibly abhorrent. Respect for\nthe right of the individual to self-will was so deeply ingrained as to\nmake the deliberate unseating of another's reason virtually impossible.\nOn the other hand, free-willed co\u00f6peration and understanding were\nequally out of reach; to enter the conscious mind of these beings was\nagony for both parties. They could neither project nor receive thoughts.\n\nEbbing vitality and the increased urgency of the problem drove him to a\ndesperate resource. A pregnant female came within the extreme range of\nhis perception. An embryo mind might serve! The mind, as yet unsullied,\nsleeping, a blank page untouched by the world, was open to him. If the\nappropriate knowledge was seeded in its memory banks it might--it\n_must_--remain sane despite the world, and a sane mind would not dispute\nwhat must be done.\n\nHe made a quick evaluation of the subject mind and discovered the flaw.\nThe intelligence potential was too low. The embryo would not be capable\nof understanding the planted memories as they came to the conscious\nlevel, nor be capable of acting on them if they were understood. Time\nwas ebbing fast, and vitality with it. Very well, then, the most\ndesperate, the most questionable resource of all remained. The unused,\nunrecognized prime center, true seat of the intellect, must be activated\nthe way nature presumably had intended that it should be, had not\nsomething gone wrong in the dawn years of the planet.\n\nThere could be no moral objection to this measure if successful, since\nit amounted to giving sight to a blind man. The element of grave doubt\nlay in the relative chances of success or failure. The strange,\ninterlocking structure of the unconscious mind of the embryo was not\nsomething that could be unraveled and examined in a hurry. Honesty\ncompelled him to evaluate himself as young and inexperienced, not\nespecially noted among his own kind for brilliantly incisive judgment.\nIt was not the sort of thing that he should even attempt without long\nstudy. It was too risky, too indecisive, too--\n\nTime made the decision. There was no time left. The chill of death told\nits own story. In an agony of haste he summoned all that remained of\nvitality and fought off Death while he entered the embryo mind.\n\nThe fast-shriveling body in the spaceship retained life long enough to\nrecognize the blunder, but not long enough to correct it. The wrong was\ndone, and could not be undone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe memories that mercifully blurred became clear again. He knew that\nin due course the mishandled embryo experienced birth, entering the\nworld normally as a helpless, feebly squirming, pathetically vulnerable\nmite, and in no way drew unusual attention to itself. No one knew, or\ncared, that intellectual awakening was phenomenally quick, the first\ntentative questionings occurring in only the fourth week of life. He\nrecalled how the stirring of objective awareness brought with it a\nhalf-remembered pang of death, and how the stirring of innocent wonder\nbrought--memories. The memory banks flooded open at the touch of wonder,\npoured out their contents, and the fledgling ego went down before the\nsurge, overwhelmed forever.\n\nInexperienced in such delicate maneuvers and overtaken at the crises by\nthe climactic unseating of Death, he had poured into the empty memory\nbanks the whole contents of his own mind. All his knowledge, all his\nexperiences, all his memories on every level of incidents great and\nsmall. Everything. Including the complex and ineradicable concept of\nhis own identity.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nThe involuntary start that shook the pine cone from his hand freed\nPhil's nostrils of the anaesthetic. Rapidly clearing eyes watched the\ncone fall near his feet and roll a few inches. A hawk that had been\nwheeling in the sky at the edge of his vision was still wheeling. Only\nseconds had elapsed, but this time there remained a clear recall of all\nthat had transpired in those few seconds of lost time--seconds in which\nhe had lived another's memories as though they were his own.\n\nReluctantly, impelled more by fascination than intent, he raised his\nhead and faced his companion. The compassionate eyes that met his did\nhold certain childlike qualities of freedom from suspicion or hardness,\nbut the gaze was not that of a simple child, nor was the bearing.\nIncongruity sparked a scarcely-controllable impulse to hysterical\nlaughter. A small boy seated on a log, regarding his elder with gentle\nkindliness and understanding! Phil made a sound deep in his throat and\nswung his head away, afraid he was going to be sick. \"Timmy\" made no\nmove. The silence endured, as it had to endure until one reaction or\nanother prevailed. Gradually Phil worked to a conclusion.\n\n\"You call it a 'blunder,'\" Phil said thickly. \"You made a freak of an\nunborn baby for your own ends, and you call it a blunder. Anyone else\nmight be content with a little innocent butchery, but not you ... you\ntake over children, body and soul!\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What we've been calling Timmy is a secondhand suit of clothes for\n_you_! And you claim you're not a monster!\"\n\n\"Nor am I.\"\n\nPhil struggled for violent words to match his feelings, then sighed\nheavily. \"No,\" he agreed, despite himself. \"You are not. I know that.\nMaybe you've controlled me just as you tricked me into entering your\nmind and living your memories but, sickened as I am, I still can't help\nbelieving you more implicitly than I've ever believed anyone. Nor do I\nsee any reason to.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"You've never known anyone as surely as you know me, now that our minds\nhave been in phase. Emotional reactions stemming from a dozen hidden\ncauses may mislead you, but at the back of your mind you _know_ me.\"\n\n\"And you know--me.\"\n\n\"I know only what I need to know about you. Your private memories are\nyour own and will always remain so unless you invite me to share them.\"\n\n\"Yet you opened all yours to me?\"\n\n\"Far from it. At this point it would give you too much to digest all at\nonce. The major part of my concentration was required to maintain mental\ncontact without any help from you, and to blanket the interference set\nup by the analytical part of your ego through its fixed, deep-rooted\nconviction equating the individual with mental isolation. Faced with\nabsolute proof to the contrary, your analytical mind still tries to\ninsist that what it has always believed to be true must still be true,\notherwise everything is suspect and, therefore, anti-survival. In other\nwords, on a survival level your mind tries to reject free telepathy\nas it would reject any other upsetting of the basic tenets of your\nexistence. That and the disharmony existing in your mind is a large part\nof the 'protecting' aura of discordance that seals you off from me.\nThe memories I shared with you I selected and edited for expediency.\nUnfortunately, your physical reaction to a startling thought caused you\nto break away before you had the full truth and left you with a false\nimpression.\"\n\n\"Either the memories you fed me were truth, or they were lies. Which\nis it?\"\n\n\"The data was true, but your interpretation of it is false because you\nare still in a state of shock, still fighting for survival on a moronic\nlevel. What do you take me to be?\"\n\n\"You name it. By your own admission, at best 'you' are a false\npersonality forcibly impressed on a helpless mind that never had a ghost\nof a chance. In effect, you are a parasite living on a host, the\nreincarnation of an ego that should be eleven years dead.\"\n\n\"Not eleven years dead--only eight.\"\n\n\"What difference does ... _eight_?\"\n\n\"Eight years dead.\"\n\nPrickles crawled over Phil's scalp and his mind raced. A series of\nmemories snapped into place.\n\n\"Eight. And I laughed at Clancey!\"\n\n\"I know--I heard. You were getting too close for comfort so I distracted\nyou by giving you a headache.\"\n\n\"Stop--let me get my breath!\" His voice rose until it threatened to\ncrack. What am I talking to! A _dog_?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"_Homer_? I don't believe it!\"\n\n\"Watch.\" The boy slipped from the log and sat beside it on the ground,\nhis back braced. \"Timmy would simply fall on his face,\" he explained,\nand with the words the face became empty and the mouth hung foolishly\nopen. Control had been relinquished. The corner of Phil's eye caught\nan answering movement that his senses wanted to reject, but he turned.\nHomer had raised his head painfully and was looking directly at him,\nunmistakable intelligence in the exhaustion-glazed eyes. The fringed\nlips curled back, the throat worked. Strange sounds were forced out,\ngrowling but not doglike.\n\n\"Ar-ro ... ar-rik.\" It was a barely recognizable distortion of\n\"Hello-Warwick.\" \"Ok-all ... orr ... ron.\" Vocal-cords-wrong?\n\"Im ... ork.\" Tim-talk?\n\nThe gray-muzzled head sank back wearily. A scuffling sound drew Phil's\ndazed eyes and he turned back in time to see Tim sit up again briskly,\nignoring the old dog.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I hate that mangled speech, don't you, Uncle Phil? I'll still call you\nthat, if you don't mind. You're still as much my uncle as you ever were,\nand I'm the only Tim you've known.\" He watched Phil anxiously. \"Knocks\nthe wind out of you, doesn't it? But ordinary speech is painfully\nlimited to begin with, without trying to force it from poor old Homer.\"\nHe chattered on nervously, giving Phil time to collect himself. \"You\nsee, Timmy is as mindless now as when he was born, three years before\n'my' ship crashed in the swamp over there. Look back through your\nnewspaper files and you'll find a brief mention of a mysterious\nexplosion reported during a night of heavy rain. That was us.\" He wet\nhis lips, watching the silent white face. \"Look, I had nothing at all to\ndo with Timmy being born an imbecile. He's like a car that functions\nwell enough if a driver takes over the physical controls that Timmy is\nincapable of handling for himself. Lacking a driver, the controls and\nthe car stand idle. It is only the body that I manipulate, not the\ndormant, disconnected mind. For myself, although I can't help\nidentifying myself emotionally and subjectively as the Challon,\nObjective reason assures me that I am Homer, with a complete but false\nset of memories and an artificially stimulated intelligence.\n\n\"As the Challon, I realized that the embryo Homer was of low actual\nintelligence, but high potential intelligence. The dangerous peculiarity\nof this planet is that several of the higher species have no known or\nrecognized function for the most important portion of their brain. It\nlies fallow, unused, blocked off much as Timmy's whole mind is blocked\noff from his service. In eight years I have done no more than form the\nmere skeleton of a theory to account for that, but the means of\ncorrection was obvious from the start. Like the appendix that floats\nfree at one end and serves no known purpose, the brain has an incomplete\nneural path of an unusual nature that has effectively camouflaged its\ntrue purpose. The intended function of the connection was the energizing\nof that prime center which you have not yet discovered and without which\nyou differ from Timmy only in degree, for you cannot realize more than a\nfragment of your incredible potential.\n\n\"The same condition exists among the higher mammals. Releasing Homer's\nblocked potential placed at his service the intellectual capacity of a\nvery clever human--according to your false standards--but not of a human\ngenius. If I had not imposed my ego on him ... you see, I cannot help\nthinking of myself as the Challon, although I know I am Homer ... if\nI had not robbed Homer of his identity and self-will, of his right\nto possess and control himself, he would have developed personality,\ncharacteristics and aptitudes of his own, appropriate to a canine of\nhigh intelligence. As it is, there are false memories of aptitudes Homer\nnever had nor could have. Physical limitations alone make some of them\nimpossible. How could a dog tinker with machinery, for example? Yet I\n'remember' working on machines of my own design. Homer's mind, in other\nwords, remembers as first-person data experiences it never had.\n\n\"In actual fact, 'I' who speak to you now am no more than the record\ncontained in a book. In terms of personality, Homer is the hidden\nstructure giving strength and substance to a false facade. 'I' am the\nfalse facade, faithfully copied from another structure. 'I' am a\nsuperimposure of ephemeral data, governing its own employment by a mind\nthat has been restricted from developing its own data. The 'I' that\nspeaks to you has no real existence, though its pattern is being subtly\nand continuously altered by that which it cloaks. If you put a drop of\nintense stain and a drop of powerful scent into a large tank of\ndistilled water, you change the superficial character of the water, make\nit seem to be other than what it is. But it remains essentially a tank\nfull of water, now containing an obtrusive trifle of alien matter in\naddition to the hydrogen and oxygen that decide its most significant\nproperties. That is what the Challon did to Homer--he released the\npotential, then accidentally but indelibly stained it with his own\npersonality.\n\n\"To me, now, it merely _seems_ as though I first suffered death and then\nan unwelcome resurrection, awakening in despair to find myself usurping\nthe helpless body of an almost new-born animal. Nothing physical or\nspiritual of the Challon survived, but the embryo mind had been fed a\nready-made identity and so believed that it had already existed as a\nChallon before re-birth as a dog. Its brain received instantly all 'my'\ntraining, so that it became at once 'mature.' What I have endured in\nthese eight years--the isolation of mind and inadequacy of body--have\nbeen a blunderer's reward visited upon his victim as a further injury.\nNow that Homer lies near death--and 'I' with him, of course--I welcome\n'our' approaching release from an unhappy situation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Wait--let me finish. Your main concern is what will happen to Timmy\nwhen 'we' die, but it will be simpler to understand if I explain as much\nas I can first. Finding myself to be a rational mind in the helpless,\nimmature body of an animal, I thought I was isolated forever. In\nchoosing the embryo to begin with, I was driven by the need for haste\nand had not understood the limitations of a canine in a human world, nor\nwould I have had any alternative if I had fully understood. When it was\ntoo late, it was not difficult to predict my future. I had no means of\ncommunicating with the dominant species, Man. In time, if I survived\nthe hazards a puppy is exposed to, I could reveal my unusual\nintelligence--could even learn to communicate in some hopelessly labored\nmanner. By using my store of inherited knowledge I could, if anyone\nwould take a dog seriously, advance your science. But I could do nothing\ntoward my main goals without exposing myself as an imitation Challon,\nand that I must never do lest I loose terrible consequences.\n\n\"I knew that the life span of my new body was pitifully short. The\nfemale had suffered repeated convulsions that affected the formation of\nthe embryos and we were an ugly litter of little mongrels, doomed by our\nphysical imperfections to a shorter-than-normal life if we were allowed\nto live and exposed to early drowning if we could not quickly charm\nourselves into a home.\n\n\"The remainder of the litter--my brothers and sisters, if I could think\nof them as such--were callously placed in a weighted sack and tossed\nin the swamp, but by that time I had found a home. The Douglas home.\nTheir child, Timmy, was an imbecile whose short-circuited mind lay\nopen to me. I found by hasty experiments that Homer's mind was capable\nof controlling and manipulating the imbecile, like a puppeteer. The\ndifficulties of controlling two bodies at once are tremendous, which is\nwhy Homer always struck you as clumsy and almost half-witted--he had to\nreceive the absolute minimum of concentration so that his exhaustion at\nclimbing the bluff this afternoon, for example, was not recognized in\ntime. Well, there it is. I took over Timmy's helpless body eight years\nago--too abruptly and with many errors--but it insured my survival for\na short time at least. Now that time is at an end and the greater part\nof what I must do is still to be done--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhil sat with his face averted, his hands clenched between his knees.\n\"The instinct to survive,\" he said in a muffled voice. \"I can't blame\nyou for what you did, but it was cruel! What a damnable trick to play\non the parents!\"\n\n\"Believe me, I know what you feel but there was no other way.\"\n\n\"No other!\" He swung around, his face mottled and his breathing heavy.\n\"Whatever you are, you made a Machiavellian puppet-master out of a\nlousy, flea-bitten mongrel! Was it beyond _those_ powers to heal Timmy's\nmind?\"\n\n\"I am not a psychopathic criminal.\"\n\n\"Do you imply that healing Timmy would involve repeating the swindle you\nworked on Homer?\"\n\n\"No. I could have by-passed the simple neural block that was leaving\nTimmy helpless, and so have given him what to you would have seemed his\nnormal intelligence. In addition, I could have completed the work that\nnature left incomplete in all of you, and so have released his full,\nenormous capabilities. I could have done all this--can still do it--and\nstill leave Timmy's ego untouched, to develop in its own way, among its\nown kind, knowing nothing of me for what I am.\"\n\n\"But you haven't done so. Why? Why!\"\n\n\"I dared not.\"\n\n\"Danger? From a small boy?\"\n\n\"Deadly danger--danger of infection that might threaten every\nintelligent race in the galaxy and even spread across the great gulfs of\nspace beyond--\"\n\n\"All this from poor little Timmy?\"\n\n\"From what he might thereby become.\"\n\n\"I'm licked.\" Phil threw out his hands angrily. \"I try to get a straight\nanswer and all I get is implications. You tell me an outrageous story,\nand I believe you. You tell me you've neatly arranged to break the\nhearts of two of my best friends, and I respect your good intentions in\ndoing so. Why? I love you like a brother, but I'm ready to take a rock\nand crush your skull in for a monster. I mean it! I could kill Homer\nwith a single kick! I could--\"\n\n\"I know, and I'm afraid of that hysterical impulse. I know the nature of\nthe struggle going on in your mind better than you do, but only you can\nfight for control. I must wait for the outcome. When you have control of\nyourself--\"\n\n\"You're so bloody sane and smug you with your secondhand suit and\nhand-me-down knowledge!\" He jumped up in a fury and turned his back on\nTimmy, addressing himself directly to Homer whose patient, pain-filled\neyes held undeniable understanding. \"Look at you! The telepathic genius\nwith personal immortality--at a price only you could stomach! Too bad\nyou got caught short and had to live in a cur! Tough, isn't it, having\nto wait for a mere moron to get control of himself! _You_ know all the\nanswers--why don't _you_ control the situation?\"\n\n\"Because the hand-me-down knowledge is no longer backed by the mental\ncapacity of a Challon.\"\n\nPhil stiffened as Tim's answering voice sounded behind him, quiet and\nfriendly. Against his will, he turned back to the boy and seated himself\nagain on the log. The boy's eyes caught and held his.\n\n\"The morality and outlook of the Challon are my morality and outlook,\nwhether I wish it so or not.\" Tim might have been making a pleasantly\ninconsequential remark about the weather for all the importance he\nseemed to attach to his statement, yet his eyes held the strained,\ntight-lipped face. \"The insight and understanding bequeathed by the\nChallon are sufficient to keep Homer's mind sane under long stress,\nand of course--\"\n\nHis soothing voice went on and on, and presently his lungs expelled\na soft breath of relief as Phil relaxed a trifle, still breathing\nraggedly. Alert eyes watched him mop his damp forehead but the quiet\nwords flowed in an unhurried stream, soothing, distracting, keeping the\nthread intact. At last the crises seemed behind them. \"... So I can only\nwait for you to absorb the emotional impact of what I've told you. I had\nplanned to prepare you, to break it gently if I could, but ... you\nunderstand?\" The voice paused, then repeated gently and insistently,\n\"You understand, don't you?\"\n\n\"Uh ... yes. Homer--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"He can't last much longer, and so of course I can't. I've landed one\nkick after another right smack in your emotional solar plexus and you're\ntrying to catch your wind.\" Tim's hand casually struck a match for the\ncigarette Phil had put unlit in his mouth and the man leaned forward\nautomatically, puffed, and automatically muttered a word of thanks. The\nquiet voice went on, taking an even more casual note. \"What with trying\nto examine the implications of everything at once, you've stirred up a\nfine old Irish stew of fears, resentments and envies, all of them trying\nto reconcile the certain knowledge that I can be trusted and the\nessentially neurotic fear that I'm playing you for an almighty sucker.\n\n\"Remember, it has been even harder for me to reconcile myself to you\nhuman beings than it can possibly be for you to accept the existence\nof the Challon. The concept of telepathy is not a completely new or\nalien one to you, but the concept of a nontelepathic civilization was\ndismissed by the Challon ages ago as a simple contradiction of terms,\na self-evident absurdity such as lifting oneself by one's bootstraps.\n\n\"It seemed so obvious that a civilized society could not develop without\nthe capacity for intelligent co\u00f6peration, and intelligent co\u00f6peration of\nany real complexity was impossible without adequate communication. What\nmeans of communication could adequately replace the direct linking of\nmind and mind? Failing any answers short of fantasy, the proposition\nalways remained a sort of classroom joke with us. In fact, several\nclassic satires exist on the subject and one of the least\nsuccessful--because it seemed too ridiculous--suggested an elaborately\ncoded system of vocalizing. We have a very elementary spoken language\nand a more complex code of inscriptions for essential records, but\nneither the written nor the spoken system could possibly be called an\nadequate means of communication.\n\n\"I realize now that one of the satires was not the rather frightening\neffort that it seemed to be, but a brilliant scientific prediction of\nthe probable development and history of a race of highly intelligent\nnontelepaths. The composer of the epic pointed out that where the\nculture and character of the Challon neither permitted nor desired\nconcealment of any sort, a race that lacked adequate communication would\nhave no choice but to live as disharmonious groups of strangers, never\ntruly knowing either their fellows or themselves. He postulated what\nyou now call traumatic experiences which, unrecognized and, therefore,\nuntreated, would fester in secrecy from childhood onward until they\nmanifested as compulsive drives or inhibitive complexes. He invented\nderanged emotions which you describe as 'guilt' and 'shame' and he\nshowed how they would cause buried memories to erupt in changed form,\nlead to cankerous misunderstandings, cause unhealthy repressions, and\nfoster frustrations.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But his master-stroke--and this was pure genius, for it was almost\ninconceivable--was when he traced the development of his 'nontelepathic\ncivilization' to the point where he predicted criminals, criminal and\nmoral codes of unbelievable complexity, and a great multitude of harmful\nand illogical taboos, local customs, and regional superstitions.\nIt was a superb achievement of creative imagination and scientific\ndeduction--but not even its creator thought it was more than an exercise\nin fantasy and perhaps not in the best of taste. The basic assumption\nwas simply too absurd for serious consideration.\"\n\n\"Yeah. I guess we were as indigestible to you as you are to me. Maybe\nI'm getting over it. Sorry ... uh ... Homer.\"\n\n\"Call me Tim. I don't think of myself as Homer and my Challon\nidentification is a mental-verbal linkage. Even 'Challon' is a\ncompromise simplification.\"\n\n\"I guess it would be. Those cracks I made--\"\n\n\"Forget them. To what you call the hag-ridden moron jittering out of\nsight in your mind, so many things equate to a threat to survival.\nAnd so many survival reactions outlast their usefulness, becoming\nessentially antisocial and antisurvival. For a telepathic race there\nare no false fronts or motives or impulses. In a nontelepathic society,\nnothing but false faces are ever seen.\"\n\n\"It's beginning to get home to me ... what about that night near the\nswamp?\"\n\n\"My poor Challonari. The shockwave of 'my' death left it alert but\nbewildered. It could not recognize nontelepathic intelligences and tried\nto turn them aside like the first one. Their deaths are on my head--or\non the organic dust that eight years ago was a Challon. The Challonari\nwas confused by the contradictions of my present identity, subtly\naltered as it has been by Homer's channeling mind, and went insane when\nfaced with a basic conflict of duties. It was like ... losing a simple\nchild.\"\n\n\"So we return to Timmy.\"\n\n\"And to you.\"\n\n\"Me? I'm going downhill fast. Let's have it before I hit rock-bottom and\n_really_ get around to reacting. And let's have a few straight answers.\nYou could have by-passed the first block that makes Timmy an idiot.\nO. K., why didn't you?\"\n\n\"I would have lost control of him at once, of course. For one thing, as\nan ordinary child his mind would be closed to me just as yours is and I\nwould be a voiceless animal with no protector, my existence likely to\nend at the bottom of a river in a weighted sack.\"\n\n\"No dice. Remember, I know you too well to believe you'd place your own\ninterests first, much as I hate to admit it.\"\n\n\"As Homer I might, survival being a basic drive. As the Challon-Homer,\nhowever, I needed a better reason than simple self-preservation. I have\nthat better reason. It lies in you, in Timmy, and in all your kind.\nPerhaps you'll see the connection when I tell you that although the\nChallon are the most intelligent race yet known to exist, Homo sapiens\nis _at present_ not far behind them. Only more efficient communication\nand the great strides that it makes possible has advanced the Challon\nculture and science so disproportionately far beyond your own.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"So the Challon are a bit brighter and a lot more advanced than we are.\nO. K., they seem like a good bunch ... or are they? Come to think of it,\nI saw them from your viewpoint which was predisposed to favor them.\"\nAnother thought struck him and he fell silent for a moment. \"You say we\nare almost their equal _at present_. What happens--if this inhibited\npotential you speak of--is released--if Man is made whole?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe answer came quietly.\n\n\n\"You would have no equal in the known universe.\"\n\nPhil's face grew thoughtful, sober, while the Challon-Homer watched\nthrough Tim's eyes the progress of a calculated gamble.\n\n\"Would the Challon--resent--our becoming superior?\"\n\n\"For the same reason that the present Challon superiority is not\nresented by races of lower intelligence, they would not themselves\nresent the appearance of intellects far greater than their own.\"\n\n\"I have a feeling there's a lot more in that answer than meets the eye.\nCan you estimate to what extent we would surpass the Challon?\"\n\n\"If my Challon memory serves me, they had no knowledge of any\nmind-structure of a capacity remotely approaching that of Man. It is\na maze, incredibly complex, with far-reaching resources I can only\nguess at. The Challon part of my mind has the profoundest admiration\nfor a superb mechanism it can only dimly comprehend, but beneath the\nChallon\"--the voice dropped almost to a whisper--\"beneath the Challon is\nthe dog, and the dog sees his god.\" The power of that factor he had not\nconsidered.\n\nPhil laughed uneasily, both shocked and repelled.\n\n\"I hope you're joking. We sound like the sweet-smelling Flower of\nCreation! When a dog reaches the level you ... um ... Homer has, it\nbecomes Man's equal, not his pet.\"\n\n\"Until Man's advance thrusts the dog back to an even lower relative\nposition, as it inevitably must when ... if ... Man comes into his own.\nI told you I dared not leave myself isolated and speechless by clearing\nthe simple short-circuit immobilizing Timmy. Now you see why I dared not\ngo even farther and release--untrained _and with no hope of adequate\ntraining_--the true Homo superior, the transcendent man.\"\n\n\"That's like turning a tiger loose in a kindergarten! Give a man a\nreally high-powered intellect and for all his shortcomings--\"\n\n\"The intellect is nothing. The data, the circumstances, the influences,\nthe environment that shape the intellect, _these_ are what count. Your\ntheorists say that although Man may some day create wonderful mechanical\nbrains with a creative capacity almost equal to Man's own, you can never\ncreate a brain that is your superior. That is true, and the reasoning is\nobvious. In a more limited sense, your body repairs itself daily but it\ncannot improve on itself, it cannot spontaneously develop functions it\nnever had--_it cannot even repair severe damage without outside help_.\nThe same applies to the mind. A sick mind cannot achieve the objectivity\nneeded to repair itself, if the damage is too great. No, the intellect\nis nothing until it learns. What would Timmy have learned, and from\nwhom? Take a minute to think of _all_ the connotations.\" Phil thought of\nsome of them, uneasily. \"Assume that from the start his status as Homo\nsuperior was recognized ... is that a fair assumption?\"\n\n\"It ... ah ... would sooner or later become apparent.\"\n\n\"After how much damage had been done that could not be undone, since\nHomo sapiens cannot ever be competent to guide and train Homo superior?\"\n\n\"Well ... what about what he could learn from your Challon mind?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I would have no voice and no assurance that telepathy would be\npossible. No influence that I could exert on him at any time could hold\nhim, if other factors impelled him to break free. A few months ago I\nrecalled a formula known to the Challon and with nothing more than\nhousehold chemicals prepared the quick and harmless anaesthetic I used\nwith you. What brought it to mind was a side-reaction reported as a\ncuriosity in one of the scientific journals Jerr ... Dad subscribes to.\nIt had an unexpected side-reaction for me, too, making direct telepathic\ncontact possible with you, but only under difficult and limited\nconditions.\"\n\n\"There's a fortune in that alone--\"\n\n\"That was an unworthy thought, Phil, typical of insecurity. I dare not\nturn loose an immature, untrained, Homo superior, the only one of his\nkind.\"\n\n\"But why the only one? Why not others as well so that they could work\nin unison?\"\n\n\"Don't you understand yet? _You are not sane!_ This planet is a\nhell-house of disordered personalities, a place of horror, a\nplague-spot. Suppose I had retained Timmy as my voice and planned on\nreleasing the inhibited potential of many people. I would have to start\nwith one man _and that one man would at once become my master_! If he\nwished, he could be the master of all the earth. Could I risk that?\"\n\n\"We have men of good moral character--\"\n\n\"By what standards acceptable to all? A good churchman, perhaps, whose\nfirst thought would be to bring everyone into the saving grace of his\nreligion? Or an atheist, who would take care that no rascally churchman\ngot the upper hand? Can you think of any man who does not have strong\nopinions on at least one subject? Who does not have one thing that he\nis a little bit more afraid of than anything else? One man who could\nbe raised to power first and not insist on at least one positive or\nnegative qualification for all who were permitted to follow? Something\nthey must either be or not be? Yourself, for example.\n\n\"Would you suggest that a Russian be chosen first? Or a Frenchman or an\nEnglishman? Or am I wrong in thinking you would 'naturally' want one of\nyour own countrymen to be chosen, purely as a precaution? But which one\nof your countrymen? Among all your acquaintances, is there even one whom\nyou would trust not to react emotionally on at least one count, thus\nautomatically rendering him unfit to play god? Bearing in mind that the\nfirst human being to find his full potential placed at his command will\nbe a titan with the power to prevent any peer being raised to oppose\nhim, would you feel safe with the choice of anyone except--yourself?\"\n\n\"Are we that bad?\"\n\n\"At birth, no, but from birth onward you are exposed to infection and\nyou sicken to a greater or lesser degree depending on the concentration\nof infection around you. Let me answer you this way. Suppose the\nspaceship were found and examined, what would happen? Among other tools\nthere is a prospecting instrument on board that is a rough approximation\nof a disintegration beam--it punches neat holes in solid rock by a\nprocess that leaves an exceedingly heavy dust behind--for a short while.\nThen something happens to the molecular bonds of the heavy dust, and the\nlittle holes become very big holes. Its principles would take you some\nyears to work out, but its manufacture and operation are fairly obvious.\nWhat would be the fate of that very useful tool?\"\n\n\"I can't deny that its possibilities as a weapon would be seized upon,\nbut with such a weapon--\"\n\n\"Ah, yes--no one would dare to go to war. At any rate, not with the\ncountry possessing the weapon.\"\n\n\"It could stop all war.\"\n\n\"If your part of the world threatened the other part of the world and\nput a halo around the 'or else'. What would the other part of the world\ndo when the first news of the spaceship leaked out, as it would do\nimmediately?\"\n\n\"O. K.--I guess you know as well as I do.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I'm not trying to ride you, Phil, but I want you to see that Fear\nand a desire for the security you can never know in your present\nstate dominate almost every important act. As a people, a race, a\nspecies, you are unsane. What am I to do? To die in peace, leaving you\nas you are, without hope or help, is against every Challon instinct.\nTo leave unrealized the human potential with its tremendous promise\nis unthinkable. Your race might destroy itself before your secret is\nrediscovered millennia from now, and the greatest wonder of creation\nbe lost forever. Even the spaceship which I have failed to destroy\nwith its innocent secrets, could destroy you simply by being found.\nWhat am I to do?\"\n\n\"I ... think you already have an answer.\"\n\n\"Yes, with your consent and only with your consent.\"\n\n\"You have it.\"\n\n\"You don't know--\"\n\n\"You have it, I said. I trust you.\"\n\n\"Man puts his faith in Dog? Well, it will not be for the first time.\nRemember us, Man, when you come into your own. Now--I must invade your\nmind, without reserve. You understand? Nothing known to you will be\nunknown to me. Are you willing?\"\n\n\"Another of those Mickey Finns?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is the only way. I will plant certain inflexible prohibitions\nwhich will forever destroy your self-will in regard to certain courses\nof action--they will be ones which you might at some time feel to be\nwise, but which I know to be ultimately destructive. In return, I can\ngive you a measure of sanity greater than you have known. You will lose\nyour hags, but you will never be entirely your own master again. You\nwill follow the course I have planned for you for the rest of your life.\nIt is the best I can do with my limited ability, and I cannot guarantee\nthat I am doing what is right.\"\n\n\"And Timmy?\"\n\n\"I have already seeded in his memory banks--a careful and painstaking\njob this time!--all the memories and knowledge appropriate to the boy\nhis parents think him to have been, plus other information which will\nbecome available to him at the right time. Every day for eight years I\ngave him the memories for that day, planning for the time when I could\npay my debt by releasing him.\"\n\n\"You take eight years that were otherwise useless to him and give him\nthe rest of his life for his own. Fair enough.\"\n\n\"No, his life is not his own. It belongs to his whole race. Your work\nwill be to supervise his training until the time is ripe, and then\nto awaken the dormant memories that will tell him what has happened\nbetween us.\"\n\n\"How do I do that?\"\n\n\"Think of it as long-term posthypnotic suggestion. It is one of the\nleast complicated matters to arrange. A simple, spoken phrase that you\nwill not remember until the right moment will be sufficient to trigger\nthe memory release. We must hurry now. Homer's breathing--can you hear\nit? His lungs have almost failed. After I enter your mind, my last act\nwill be to release the simple block that makes Timmy an imbecile ...\nhe will awaken and not know that he has slept all his life until this\nmoment when he becomes in actuality an ordinary, quite intelligent boy.\nHe will not grieve unduly for Homer, and I who have two bodies and am at\nhome in neither of them will be a record that will finally be erased.\nAre you ready?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"No--wait. I must know what all this is leading to!\"\n\n\"We have so little time! Well, then, it is leading to broken hearts, to\nhatred, and to injustice. Perhaps to martyrdom, perhaps to glory. If my\nplans fail, your lot will be public anathema as a fool or a murderer,\nfor I will prohibit you from ever clearing yourself by speaking the\ntruth about it.\"\n\n\"Who would believe it!\"\n\n\"Enough would become curious. A little research along the right lines\nand you would prematurely learn your own secret. Then a race of mad\ndemigods would be loosed through the void, an all-conquering scourge\ninstead of a blessing. I would sooner have your whole race die with your\nvery existence unsuspected, than have you live in infamy, the unchecked\ntyrants of the stars. Not even the Challon could stand against you,\nnor could they coerce a single one of you whose whole potential had been\nreleased.\"\n\n\"Then what hope--\"\n\n\"Timmy's newly-awakened mind will be completely sane. The aids I have\ngiven it may keep it sufficiently sane for the next few years, despite\ninfection on all sides. In those years you will watch over him and\naccumulate the funds that will be needed. That will not be difficult.\nYou must buy the lands surrounding the spaceship and build a laboratory\nwhere you will conduct some dangerous experiments, thus explaining the\nneed for an isolated location. The laboratory is only a blind. The ship\nmust be freed from the swamp and repaired in some minor respects, then\nan 'accidental explosion' one night will destroy the buildings to cover\nthe take-off. Timmy will be presumed killed in the explosion. His\nparents will grieve, the public may blame you, and you will sink into\nobscurity. You may live long enough to learn whether Timmy ever\nsucceeded in reaching Challon in a spaceship not designed for his race.\nMy memories and implanted commands will constantly guide and instruct\nhim--\"\n\n\"How ... how old must he be?\"\n\n\"As young as possible. As soon as all is ready. Tomorrow, if that were\npossible.\"\n\n\"A child!\"\n\n\"For at least a little while he will be more than the equal of a 'good'\nman. Child, or youth, or man, I will free him from fear and loneliness\non the long voyage. If he reaches Challon, they will understand and\nperhaps not think I have blundered too badly. They will heal him, study\nhim, free him. Then it will be his problem to free his race. If you are\nvery lucky, you may still be alive at that time.\"\n\n\"And if he never reaches--\"\n\n\"You will never know. Are you ready?\"\n\nPhil looked desperately at the setting sun and the long, long shadows,\nas though he were a doomed man awaiting execution.\n\n\"Get on with it,\" he said huskily.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVery little happened. There was a small lapse of time during which\nan observer would have seen certain lines of tension vanish almost\nmagically from the man's face--might even have thought that some\nyears seemed to drop from his age. Presently the man roused himself,\nstretching with the careless vigor of a youth as he experienced a serene\npeace of mind that he had not known since he was very young indeed. He\nglanced casually at the boy seated near him--a boy who looked at the\nworld with an air of fleeting puzzlement--then dropped on his knees and\ncradled an ugly, grizzled head in his arms. A last flicker enlivened the\neyes and a dry tongue touched his hand just once.\n\nThat was all.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Astounding Science\nFiction October 1955.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
