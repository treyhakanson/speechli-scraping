V. E. Thiessen_\n\n\n There is a quiet horror to\n this story from Tomorrow....\n\n\nEvening had begun to fall. In the cities the clamor softened along the\nstreets, and the women made small, comfortable, rattling noises in the\nkitchens. Out in the country the cicadas started their singing, and the\ncool smell began to rise out of the earth. But everywhere, in the cities\nand in the country, the children were late from school.\n\nThere were a few calls, but the robotic telephone devices at the schools\ngave back the standard answer: \"The schools are closed for the day. If\nyou will leave a message it will be recorded for tomorrow.\"\n\nThe telephones between houses began to ring. \"Is Johnny home from school\nyet?\"\n\n\"No. Is Jane?\"\n\n\"Not yet. I wonder what can be keeping them?\"\n\n\"Something new, I guess. Oh, well, the roboteachers know best. They will\nbe home soon.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. It's foolish to worry.\"\n\nThe children did not come.\n\nAfter a time a few cars were driven to the schools. They were met by the\nrobots. The worried parents were escorted inside. But the children did\nnot come home.\n\nAnd then, just as alarm was beginning to stir all over the land, the\nrobots came walking, all of the robots from the grade schools, and the\nhigh schools, and the colleges. All of the school system walking, with\nthe roboteachers saying, \"Let us go into the house where you can sit\ndown.\" All over the streets of the cities and the walks in the country\nthe robots were entering houses.\n\n\"What's happened to my children?\"\n\n\"If you will go inside and sit down--\"\n\n\"What's happened to my children? Tell me now!\"\n\n\"If you will go inside and sit down--\"\n\nSteel and electrons and wires and robotic brains were inflexible. How\ncan you force steel to speak? All over the land the people went inside\nand sat nervously waiting an explanation.\n\nThere was no one out on the streets. From inside the houses came the\nsound of surprise and agony. After a time there was silence. The robots\ncame out of the houses and went walking back to the schools. In the\ncities and in the country there was the strange and sudden silence of\ntragedy.\n\nThe children did not come home.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe morning before the robots walked, Johnny Malone, the Mayor's son,\nbounced out of bed with a burst of energy. Skinning out of his pajamas\nand into a pair of trousers, he hurried, barefooted, into his mother's\nbedroom. She was sleeping soundly, and he touched one shoulder\nhesitantly.\n\n\"Mother!\"\n\nThe sleeping figure stirred. His mother's face, still faintly shiny with\nhormone cream, turned toward him. She opened her eyes. Her voice was\nirritated.\n\n\"What is it, Johnny?\"\n\n\"Today's the day, mommy. Remember?\"\n\n\"The day?\" Eyebrows raised.\n\n\"The new school opens. Now we'll have roboteachers like everyone else.\nWill you fix my breakfast, mother?\"\n\n\"Amelia will fix you something.\"\n\n\"Aw, mother. Amelia's just a robot. This is a special day. And I want my\ndaddy to help me with my arithmetic before I go. I don't want the\nroboteacher to think I'm dumb.\"\n\nHis mother frowned in deepening irritation. \"Now, there's no reason why\nAmelia can't get your breakfast like she always does. And I doubt if it\nwould be wise to wake your father. You know he likes to sleep in the\nmorning. Now, you go on out of here and let me sleep.\"\n\nJohnny Malone turned away, fighting himself for a moment, for he knew he\nwas too big to cry. He walked more slowly now and entered his father's\nroom. He had to shake his father to awaken him.\n\n\"Daddy! Wake up, daddy!\"\n\n\"What in the devil? Oh, Johnny.\" His father's eyes were sleepily bleak.\n\"What in thunder do you want?\"\n\n\"Today's the first day of roboteachers. I can't work my arithmetic.\nWill you help me before I go to school?\"\n\nHis father stared at him in amazement. \"Just what in the devil do you\nthink roboteachers are for? They're supposed to teach you. If you knew\narithmetic we wouldn't need roboteachers.\"\n\n\"But the roboteachers may be angry if I don't have my lesson.\"\n\nJohnny Malone's father turned on one elbow. \"Listen, son,\" he said. \"If\nthose roboteachers give you any trouble you just tell them you're the\nMayor's son. See. Now get the devil out of here. What's her name--that\nservorobot--Amelia will get your breakfast and get you off to school.\nNow suppose you beat it out of here and let me go back to sleep.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir.\" Eyes smarting, Johnny Malone went down the stairs to the\nkitchen. It wasn't that his parents were different. All the kids were\nfed and sent to school by robots. It was just that--well today seemed\nsort of special. Downstairs Amelia, the roboservant, placed hot cereal\non the table before him. After he had forced a few bites past the\ntightness in his throat, Amelia checked the temperature and his clothing\nand let him out the door. The newest school was only a few blocks from\nhis home, and Johnny could walk to school.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe newest school stood on the edge of this large, middlewestern city.\nOff to the back of the school were the towers of the town, great\nmonolithic skyscrapers of pre-stressed concrete and plastic. To the\nfront of the school the plains stretched out to meet a cloudy horizon.\n\nA helio car swung down in front of the school. Two men and a woman got\nout.\n\n\"This is it, Senator.\" Doctor Wilson, the speaker, was with the\ngovernment bureau of schools. He lifted his arm and gestured, a lean,\ntweed-suited man.\n\nThe second man, addressed as Senator, was bulkier, grey suited and\npompous. He turned to the woman with professional deference.\n\n\"This is the last one, my dear. This is what Doctor Wilson calls the\ngreatest milestone in man's education.\"\n\n\"With the establishing of this school the last human teacher is gone.\nGone are all the human weaknesses, the temper fits of teachers, their\nignorance and prejudices. The roboteachers are without flaw.\"\n\nThe woman lifted a lorgnette to her eyes. \"_Haow_ interesting. But after\nall, we've had roboteachers for years, haven't we--or have we--?\" She\nmade a vague gesture toward the school, and looked at the brown-suited\nman.\n\n\"Yes, of course. Years ago your women's clubs fought against\nroboteachers. That was before they were proven.\"\n\n\"I seem to recall something of that. Oh well, it doesn't matter.\" The\nlorgnette gestured idly.\n\n\"Shall we go in?\" the lean man urged.\n\nThe woman hesitated. Senator said tactfully, \"After all, Doctor Wilson\nwould like you to see his project.\"\n\nThe brown-suited man nodded. His face took on a sharp intensity. \"We're\nmaking a great mistake. No one is interested in educating the children\nany more. They leave it to the robots. And they neglect the children's\ntraining at home.\"\n\nThe woman turned toward him with surprise in her eyes. \"But really,\naren't the robots the best teachers?\"\n\n\"Of course they are. But confound it, we ought to be interested in what\nthey teach and how they teach. What's happened to the old PTA? What's\nhappened to parental discipline, what's happened to--\"\n\nHe stopped suddenly and smiled, a rueful tired smile. \"I suppose I'm a\nfanatic on this. Come on inside.\"\n\nThey passed through an antiseptic corridor built from dull green\nplastic. The brown-suited man pressed a button outside one of the\nclassrooms. A door slid noiselessly into the hall. A robot stood before\nthem, gesturing gently. They followed the robot into the classroom. At\nthe head of the classroom another robot was lecturing. There were\ndrawings on a sort of plastic blackboard. There were wire models on the\ndesk in front of the robot. They listened for a moment, and for a moment\nit seemed that the woman could be intrigued in spite of herself.\n\n\"Mathematics,\" Doctor Wilson murmured in her ear. \"Euclidean Geometry\nand Aristotelean reasoning. We start them young on these old schools of\nthought, then use Aristotle and Euclid as a point of departure for our\nintermediate classes in mathematics and logic.\"\n\n\"REAHLLY!\" The lorgnette studied Doctor Wilson. \"You mean there are\nseveral kinds of geometry?\"\n\nDoctor Wilson nodded. A dull flush crept into his cheeks. The Senator\ncaught his eyes and winked. The woman moved toward the door. At the door\nthe robot bowed.\n\nThe lorgnette waved in appreciation. \"It's reahlly been most charming!\"\n\nWilson said desperately, \"If your women's clubs would just visit our\nschools and see this work we are carrying on ...\"\n\n\"Reahlly, I'm sure the robots are doing a marvelous job. After all,\nthat's what they were built for.\"\n\nWilson called, \"Socrates! Come here!\" The robot approached from his\nposition outside the classroom door.\n\n\"Why were you built, Socrates? Tell the lady why you were built.\"\n\nA metal throat cleared, a metal voice said resonantly, \"We were made to\nserve the children. The children are the heart of a society. As the\nchildren are raised, so will the future be assured. I will do everything\nfor the children's good, this is my prime law. All other laws are\nsecondary to the children's good.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Socrates. You may go.\"\n\nMetal footsteps retreated. The lorgnette waved again. \"Very impressive.\nVery efficient. And now, Senator, if we can go. We are to have tea at\nthe women's club. Varden is reviewing his newest musical comedy.\"\n\nThe Senator said firmly, \"Thank you, Doctor Wilson.\"\n\nHis smile was faintly apologetic. It seemed to say that the women's\nclubs had many votes, but that Wilson should understand, Wilson's own\nvote would be appreciated too. Wilson watched the two re-enter the\nhelicopter and rise into the morning sunshine. He kicked the dirt with\nhis shoe and turned to find Socrates behind him. The metallic voice\nspoke.\n\n\"You are tired. I suggest you go home and rest.\"\n\n\"I'm not tired. Why can they be so blind, so uninterested in the\nchildren?\"\n\n\"It is our job to teach the children. You are tired. I suggest you go\nhome and rest.\"\n\nHow can you argue with metal? What can you add to a perfect mechanism,\ndesigned for its job, and integrated with a hundred other perfect\nmechanisms? What can you do when a thousand schools are so perfect they\nhave a life of their own, with no need for human guidance, and, most\nsignificant, no failures from human weakness?\n\nWilson stared soberly at this school, at the colossus he had helped to\ncreate. He had the feeling that it was wrong somehow, that if people\nwould only think about it they could find that something was wrong.\n\n\"You are tired.\"\n\nHe nodded at Socrates. \"Yes, I am tired. I will go home.\"\n\nOnce, on the way home, he stared back toward the school with strange\nunease.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInside the school there was the ringing of a bell. The children trooped\ninto the large play area that was enclosed in the heart of the great\nbuilding. Here and there they began to form in clusters. At the centers\nof the clusters were the newest students, the ones that had moved here,\nthe ones that had been in the robot schools before.\n\n\"Is it true that the roboteachers will actually spank you?\"\n\n\"It's true, all right.\"\n\n\"You're kidding. It's only a story, like Santa Claus or Johnny\nAppleseed. The human teachers never spanked us here.\"\n\n\"The robots will spank you if you get out of line.\"\n\n\"My father says no robot can lay a hand on a human.\"\n\n\"These robots are different.\"\n\nThe bell began to ring again. Recess was over. The children moved toward\nthe classroom. All the children except one--Johnny Malone, husky Johnny\nMalone, twelve years old--the Mayor's son. Johnny Malone kicked at the\ndirt. A robot proctor approached. The metallic voice sounded.\n\n\"The ringing of the bell means that classes are resumed. You will take\nyour place, please.\"\n\n\"I won't go inside.\"\n\n\"You will take your place, please.\"\n\n\"I won't. You can't make me take my place. My father is the Mayor.\"\n\nThe metal voice carried no feeling. \"If you do not take your place you\nwill be punished.\"\n\n\"You can't lay a hand on me. No robot can.\"\n\nThe robot moved forward. Two metal hands held Johnny Malone. Johnny\nMalone kicked the robot's legs. It hurt his toes. \"We were made to teach\nthe children. We can do what is necessary to teach the children. I will\ndo everything for the children's good. It is my prime law. All other\nlaws are secondary to the children's good.\"\n\nThe metal arms moved. The human body bent across metal knees. A metal\nhand raised and fell, flat, very flat so that it would sting and the\nblood would come rushing, and yet there would be no bruising, no damage\nto the human flesh. Johnny Malone cried out in surprise. Johnny Malone\nwept. Johnny Malone squirmed. The metal ignored all of these. Johnny\nMalone was placed on his feet. He swarmed against the robot, striking it\nwith small fists, bruising them against the solid smoothness of the\nrobot's thighs.\n\n\"You will take your place, please.\"\n\nTears were useless. Rage was useless. Metal cannot feel. Johnny Malone,\nthe Mayor's son, was intelligent. He took his place in the classroom.\n\nOne of the more advanced literature classes was reciting. The\nroboteacher said metallically,\n\n    \"_The weird sisters, hand in hand,\n    Posters of the sea and land,\n    Thus do go about, about:\n    Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,\n    And thrice again, to make up nine.\n    Peace! the charm's wound up._\"\n\nHands shot into the air. The metallic voice said, \"Tom?\"\n\n\"That's from Shakespeare's _Macbeth_.\"\n\n\"And what is its meaning?\"\n\n\"The weird sisters are making a charm in the beginning of the play. They\nhave heard the drum that announces Macbeth's coming.\"\n\n\"That is correct.\"\n\nA new hand shot into the air. \"Question, teacher. May I ask a question?\"\n\n\"You may always ask a question.\"\n\n\"Are witches real? Do you robots know of witches? And do you know of\npeople? Can a roboteacher understand Shakespeare?\"\n\nThe thin metal voice responded. \"Witches are real and unreal. Witches\nare a part of the reality of the mind, and the human mind is real. We\nroboteachers are the repository of the human mind. We hold all the\nwisdom and the knowledge and the aspirations of the human race. We hold\nthese for you, the children, in trust. Your good is our highest law. Do\nyou understand?\"\n\nThe children nodded. The metallic voice went on. \"Let us return to\n_Macbeth_ for our concluding quotation. The weather, fortune, many\nthings are implied in Macbeth's opening speech. He says, '_So foul and\nfair a day I have not seen._' The paradox is both human and appropriate.\nOne day you will understand this even more. Repeat the quotation after\nme, please, and try to understand it.\"\n\nThe childish voices lifted. \"_So foul and fair a day I have not seen._\"\n\nThe roboteacher stood up. \"And there's the closing bell. Do not hurry\naway, for you are to remain here tonight. There will be a school party,\na sleep-together party. We will all sleep here in the school building.\"\n\n\"You mean we can't go home?\"\n\nThe face of the littlest girl screwed up. \"I want to go home.\"\n\n\"You may go home tomorrow. There will be a holiday tomorrow. A party\ntonight and a holiday tomorrow for every school on earth.\"\n\nThe tears were halted for a moment. The voice was querulous. \"But I want\nto go home now.\"\n\nJohnny Malone, the Mayor's son, put one hand on the littlest girl.\n\"Don't cry, Mary. The robots don't care if you cry or not. You can't\nhurt them or cry them out of anything. We'll all go home in the\nmorning.\"\n\nThe robots began to bring cots and to place them in the schoolroom, row\non row. The children were led out into the play quadrangle to play. One\nof the robots taught them a new game, and after that took them to supper\nserved in the school's cafeteria. No other robot was left in the\nbuilding, but it did not matter, because the doors were locked so that\nthe children could not go home.\n\nThe other robots had begun to walk out into the town, and as they walked\nthe robots walked from other schools, in other towns. All over the\ncountry, all over the towns, the robots walked to tell the people that\nthe children would not be home from school, and do what had to be done.\n\nIn the schools, the roboteachers told stories until the children fell\nasleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMorning came. The robots were up with the sun. The children were up with\nthe robots. There was breakfast and more stories, and now the children\nclustered about the robots, holding onto their arms, where they could\ncling, tagging and frisking along behind the robots as they went down\ninto the town. The sun was warm, and it was early, early, and very\nbright from the morning sun in the streets.\n\nThey went into the Mayor's house. Johnny called, \"Mom! Dad! I'm home.\"\n\nThe house was silent. The robot that tended the house came gliding in\nanswer. \"Would you like breakfast, Master Malone?\"\n\n\"I've had breakfast. I want my folks. Hey! Mom, Dad!\"\n\nHe went into the bedroom. It was clean and empty and scrubbed.\n\n\"Where's my mother and father?\"\n\nThe metal voice of the robot beside Johnny said, \"I am going to live\nwith you. You will learn as much at home as you do at school.\"\n\n\"Where's my mother?\"\n\n\"I'm your mother.\"\n\n\"Where's my father?\"\n\n\"I'm your father.\"\n\nJohnny Malone swung. \"You mean my mother and father are gone?\" Tears\ngathered in his eyes.\n\nGently, gently, the metal hand pulled him against the metal body. \"Your\nfolks have gone away, Johnny. Everyone's folks have gone away. We will\nstay with you.\"\n\nJohnny Malone ran his glance around the room.\n\n\"I might have known they were gone. The place is so clean.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll the houses were clean. The servant robots had cleaned all night. The\nroboteachers had checked each house before the children were brought\nhome. The children must not be alarmed. There must be no bits of blood\nto frighten them.\n\nThe robot's voice said gently, \"Today will be a holiday to become\naccustomed to the changes. There will be school tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ November 1956.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
