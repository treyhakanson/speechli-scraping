The remunerative editors were certainly\nfools to turn it down. Glad to see that a number of readers are\nshowing up Ackerman. People like Ackerman are peculiarly\nridiculous--one can plainly see that this type of thing is merely\negotistic and a gesture to call attention to themselves. However, most\npeople out-grow this stage. Glad you were able to get something from\nyoung Barlow--he's distinctly worth encouraging.\" H. P. Lovecraft\n\nClark Ashton Smith informs us that Astounding Stories has just\naccepted one of his tales, \"The Demon of the Flowers,\" and Weird Tales\nhas just taken \"The Tomb Spawn.\" He tells us that we will find a\nsurprise in connection with his story, \"The Weaver in the Vault\" in\nthe January, 1934, Weird Tales.\n\n\"Your editorial was a corker, the various departments okay, and\nSmith's yarn was worthy of Weird Tales.\" Allen Glasser. Mr. Glasser is\nattempting to make a living at writing--and isn't doing so bad at it.\nThe editor prefers to call him \"the Arthur J. Burks of the younger\ngeneration.\" He has sold stories to dozens of magazines, including\nscience fiction.\n\n\"The second issue was swell. I'd like to see more stories by Clark\nAshton Smith in future issues of the mag. Yep, 20 pages of excellent\narticles and stories.\"--Ted Lutwin. Clark Ashton Smith is a regular\ncontributor to THE FANTASY FAN.\n\nKenneth B. Pritchard, although he liked the second number immensely,\nreminds us that we omitted several things that we promised in the\nSeptember issue. Here's the reason: many articles were crowded out of\nthis number, and others were postponed to make room for a number of\nmuch better articles which came in the last minute. Everything\npromised will be published in good time, though.\n\nLloyd Fowler wants us to keep using the grade of paper that we are,\ninstead of cutting down the number of pages in order to afford a\nbetter grade.\n\n\"THE FANTASY FAN is starting out well.\"--Ralph Milne Farley\n\nFrom A. Merritt, whom everybody knows, we hear that he had started a\nsequel to \"Thru The Dragon Glass,\" but abandoned it because he didn't\nlike to write sequels. Our belief is that great authors don't need to\nwrite sequels.\n\n\n\n\nSUPERNATURAL HORROR\n\nIN LITERATURE\n\nby H. P. Lovecraft\n\n(Copyright 1927 by W. Paul Cook)\n\nPart Two\n\n\nBecause we remember pain and the menace of death more vividly than\npleasure, and because our feelings toward the beneficent aspects of\nthe unknown have from the first been captured and formalised by\nconventional religious rituals, it has fallen to the lot of the darker\nand more maleficent side of cosmic mystery to figure chiefly in our\npopular supernatural folklore. The tendency, too, is naturally\nenhanced by the fact that uncertainty and danger are closely allied;\nthus making any kind of an unknown world, a world of peril and evil\npossibilities. When to this sense of fear and evil the inevitable\nfascination of wonder and curiosity is superadded, there is born a\ncomposite body of keen emotion and imaginative provocation whose\nvitality must of necessity endure as long as the human race itself.\nChildren will always be afraid of the dark, and men with minds\nsensitive to hereditary impulse will always tremble at the thought of\nthe hidden and fathomless worlds or strange life which may pulsate in\nthe gulfs beyond the stars, or press hideously upon our own globe in\nunholy dimensions which only the dead and the moonstruck can glimpse.\n\nWith this foundation, no one need wonder at the existence of a\nliterature of cosmic fear. It has always existed, and always will\nexist; and no better evidence of its tenacious vigour can be cited\nthan the impulse which now and then drives writers of totally opposite\nleanings to try their hands at it in isolated tales, as if to\ndischarge from their minds certain phantasmal shapes which would\notherwise haunt them. Thus did Dickens write several eerie narratives;\nBrowning the hideous poem, \"Childe Roland\"; Henry James, \"The Turn of\nthe Screw\"; Dr. Holmes, the subtle novel \"Elsie Venner\"; F. Marion\nCrawford, \"The Upper Berth\" and a number of other examples; Mrs.\nCharlotte Perkins Gilman, social worker, \"The Yellow Wall Paper\";\nwhilst the humorist, W. W. Jacobs, produced that able melodramatic bit\ncalled \"The Monkey's Paw.\"\n\n\n(Continued next month)\n\n\n\n\nSEQUELS--BY POPULAR DEMAND\n\nby Walt Z. Russjuchi\n\nPart Three--Conclusion\n\n\nScience Wonder Stories (now Wonder Stories) published a 2-part serial\nby Edwards in 1930, \"A Rescue from Jupiter,\" and its sequel, \"The\nReturn from Jupiter,\" appeared the following year.\n\nMany characters have been so liked that their author creators have\nwritten a number of sequel-stories around them in which they are\nplunged into a series of exciting adventures. The most popular are\nKeller's Taine of San Francisco, Meek's Dr. Bird, Quinn's Jules de\nGrandin, Gilmore's Hawk Carse, Burroughs' Tarzan & John Carter,\nWright's Commander Hanson, and Fezandie's Dr. Hackensaw.\n\nOf course, it is realized that only the surface of this subject has\nbeen skimmed, but if the reader is further interested in sequels, he\nmay idle away many an interesting hour considering why stories have\nsequels, and what stories should have them.\n\n\n\n\nThe Other Gods\n\nby H. P. Lovecraft\n\n\nAtop the tallest of earth's peaks dwell the gods of earth, and suffer\nno man to tell that he hath looked upon them. Lesser peaks they once\ninhabited; but ever the men from the plains would scale the slopes of\nrock and snow, driving the gods to higher and higher mountains till\nnow only the last remains. When they left their older peaks they took\nwith them all signs of themselves, save once, it is said, when they\nleft a carven image on the face of the mountain which they called\nNgranek.\n\nBut now they have betaken themselves to unknown Kadath in the cold\nwaste where no man treads, and are grown stern, having no higher peak\nwhereto to flee at the coming of men. They are grown stern, and where\nonce they suffered men to displace them, they now forbid men to come;\nor coming, to depart. It is well for men that they know not of Kadath\nin the cold waste, else they would seek injudiciously to scale it.\n\nSometimes when earth's gods are homesick they visit in the still night\nthe peaks where once they dwelt, and weep softly as they try to play\nin the olden way on remembered slopes. Men have felt the tears of the\ngods on white-capped Thurai, though they have thought it rain; and\nhave heard the sighs of the gods in the plaintive dawn-winds of\nLerion. In cloud-ships the gods are wont to travel, and wise cotters\nhave legends that keep them from certain high peaks at night when it\nis cloudy, for the gods are not lenient as of old.\n\nIn Ulthar, which lies beyond the river Skai, once dwelt an old man\navid to behold the gods of earth; a man deeply learned in the seven\ncryptical books of earth; and familiar with the Pnakotic Manuscripts\nof distant and frozen Lomar. His name was Barzai the Wise, and the\nvillagers tell of how he went up a mountain on the night of the\nstrange eclipse.\n\nBarzai knew so much of the gods that he could tell of their comings\nand goings, and guessed so many of their secrets that he was deemed\nhalf a god himself. It was he who wisely advised the burgesses of\nUlthar when they passed their remarkable law against the slaying of\ncats, and who first told the young priest Atal where it is that black\ncats go at midnight on St. John's Eve. Barzai was learned in the lore\nof earth's gods, and had gained a desire to look upon their faces. He\nbelieved that his great secret knowledge of gods could shield him from\ntheir wrath, so resolved to go up to the summit of high and rocky\nHatheg-Kla on a night when he knew the gods would be there.\n\nHatheg-Kla is far in the stony desert beyond Hatheg, for which it is\nnamed, and rises like a rock statue in a silent temple. Around its\npeak the mists play always mournfully, for mists are the memories of\nthe gods, and the gods loved Hatheg-Kla when they dwelt upon it in the\nold days. Often the gods of earth visit Hatheg-Kla in their ships of\ncloud, casting pale vapours over the slopes as they dance\nreminiscently on the summit under a clear moon. The villagers of\nHatheg say it is ill to climb Hatheg-Kla at any time, and deadly to\nclimb it by night when pale vapours hide the summit and the moon; but\nBarzai heeded them not when he came from neighboring Ulthar with the\nyoung priest Atal, who was his disciple. Atal was only the son of an\ninnkeeper, and was sometimes afraid; but Barzai's father had been a\nlandgrave who dwelt in an ancient castle, so he had no common\nsuperstition in his blood, and only laughed at the fearful cotters.\n\nBarzai and Atal went out of Hatheg into the stony desert despite the\nprayers of peasants, and talked of earth's gods by their campfires at\nnight. Many days they travelled, and from afar saw lofty Hatheg-Kla\nwith his aureole of mournful mist. On the thirteenth day they reached\nthe mountain's lonely base, and Atal spoke of his fears. But Barzai\nwas old and learned and had no fears, so led the way boldly up the\nslope that no man had scaled since the time of Sansu, who is written\nof with fright in the mouldy Pnakotic Manuscripts.\n\nThe way was rocky, and made perilous by chasms, cliffs, and falling\nstones. Later it grew cold and snowy; and Barzai and Atal often\nslipped and fell as they hewed and plodded upward with staves and\naxes. Finally the air grew thin, and the sky changed colour, and the\nclimbers found it hard to breathe; but still they toiled up and up,\nmarvelling at the strangeness of the scene and thrilling at the\nthought of what would happen on the summit when the moon was out and\nthe pale vapours spread around. For three days they climbed higher,\nand higher toward the roof of the world; then they camped to wait for\nthe clouding of the moon.\n\nFor four nights no clouds came, and the moon shone down cold through\nthe thin mournful mists around the silent pinnacle. Then on the fifth\nnight, which was the night of the full moon, Barzai saw some dense\nclouds far to the north, and stayed up with Atal to watch them draw\nnear. Thick and majestic they sailed, slowly and deliberately onward;\nranging themselves round the peak high above the watchers, and hiding\nthe moon and the summit from view. For a long hour the watchers gazed,\nwhilst the vapours swirled and the screen of clouds grew thicker and\nmore restless. Barzai was wise in the lore of earth's gods, and\nlistened hard for certain sounds, but Atal felt the chill of the\nvapours and the awe of the night, and feared much. And when Barzai\nbegan to climb higher and beckon eagerly, it was long before Atal\nwould follow.\n\nSo thick were the vapours that the way was hard, and though Atal\nfollowed on at last, he could scarce see the grey shape of Barzai on\nthe dim slope above in the clouded moonlight. Barzai forged very far\nahead, and seemed despite his age to climb more easily than Atal;\nfearing not the steepness that began to grow too great for any save a\nstrong and dauntless man, nor pausing at wide black chasms that Atal\ncould scarce leap. And so they went up wildly over rocks and gulfs,\nslipping and stumbling, and sometimes awed at the vastness and\nhorrible silence of bleak ice pinnacles and mute granite steeps.\n\nVery suddenly Barzai went out of Atal's sight, scaling a hideous cliff\nthat seemed to bulge outward and block the path for any climber not\ninspired of earth's gods. Atal was far below, and planning what he\nshould do when he reached the place, when curiously he noticed that\nthe light had grown strong, as if the cloudless peak and moonlit\nmeeting-place of the gods were very near. And as he scrambled on\ntoward the bulging cliff and litten sky he felt fears more shocking\nthan any he had known before. Then through the high mists he heard the\nvoice of unseen Barzai shouting wildly in delight:\n\n\"I have heard the gods! I have heard earth's gods singing in revelry\non Hatheg-Kla! The voices of earth's gods are known to Barzai the\nProphet! The mists are thin and the moon is bright, and I shall see\nthe gods dancing wildly on Hatheg-Kla that they loved in youth. The\nwisdom of Barzai hath made him greater than earth's gods, and against\nhis will their spells and barriers are as naught; Barzai will behold\nthe gods, the proud gods, the secret gods, the gods of earth who spurn\nthe sight of man!\"\n\nAtal could not hear the voices Barzai heard, but he was now close to\nthe bulging cliff and scanning it for footholds. Then he heard\nBarzai's voice grow shriller and louder:\n\n\"The mist is very thin, and the moon casts shadows on the slope; the\nvoice of earth's gods art high and wild, and they fear the coming of\nBarzai the Wise, who is greater than they.... The moon's light\nflickers, as earth's gods dance against it; I shall see the dancing\nforms of the gods that leap and howl in the moonlight.... The light is\ndimmer and the gods are afraid....\"\n\nWhilst Barzai was shouting these things Atal felt a spectral change in\nall the air, as if the laws of earth were bowing to greater laws; for\nthough the way was steeper than ever, the upward path was now grown\nfearsomely easy, and the bulging cliff proved scarce an obstacle when\nhe reached it and slid perilously up its convex face. The light of the\nmoon had strangely failed, and as Atal plunged upward through the\nmists he heard Barzai the Wise shrieking in the shadows:\n\n\"The moon is dark, and the gods dance in the night; there is terror in\nthe sky, for upon the moon hath sunk an eclipse foretold in no books\nof men or of earth's gods.... There is unknown magic on Hatheg-Kla, for\nthe screams of the frightened gods have turned to laughter, and the\nslopes of ice shoot up endlessly into the black heavens whither I am\nplunging.... Hei! Hei! At last! In the dim light I behold the gods of\nearth!\"\n\nAnd now Atal, slipping dizzily up over inconceivable steeps, heard in\nthe dark a loathsome laughing, mixed with such a cry as no man else\never heard save in the Phlegethon of unrelatable nightmares; a cry\nwherein reverberated the horror and anguish of a haunted lifetime\npacked into one atrocious moment:\n\n\"The Other gods! The Other gods! The gods of the outer hells that\nguard the feeble gods of earth.... Look away.... Go back.... Do not\nsee! Do not see! The vengeance of the infinite abysses.... That\ncursed, that damnable pit.... Merciful gods of earth, I am falling\ninto the sky!\"\n\nAnd as Atal shut his eyes and stopped his eyes and stopped his ears\nand tried to jump downward against the frightful pull from unknown\nheights, there resounded on Hatheg-Kla that terrible peal of thunder\nwhich awaked the good cotters of the plains and the honest burgesses\nof Hatheg, Nir and Ulthar, and caused them to behold through the\nclouds that strange eclipse of the moon that no book ever predicted.\nAnd when the moon came out at last Atal was safe on the lower snows of\nthe mountain without sight of earth's gods, or of the Other gods.\n\nNow it is told in the mouldy Pnakotic Manuscripts that Sansu found\nnaught but wordless ice and rock when he did climb Hatheg-Kla in the\nyouth of the world. Yet when the men of Ulthar and Nir and Hatheg\ncrushed their fears and scaled that haunted steep by day in search of\nBarzai the Wise, they found graven in the naked stone of the summit a\ncurious and Cyclopean symbol fifty cubits wide, as if the rock had\nbeen riven by some titanic chisel. And the symbol was like to one that\nlearned men have discerned in those frightful parts of the Pnakotic\nManuscripts which were too ancient to be read. This they found.\n\nBarzai the Wise they never found, nor could the holy priest Atal ever\nbe persuaded to pray for his soul's repose. Moreover, to this day the\npeople of Ulthar and Nir and Hatheg fear eclipses, and pray by night\nwhen pale vapours hide the mountain-top and the moon. And above the\nmists on Hatheg-Kla, earth's gods sometimes dance reminiscently; for\nthey know they are safe, and love to come from unknown Kadath in ships\nof cloud and play in the olden way, as they did when earth was new and\nmen not given to the climbing of inaccessible places.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nINFORMATION\n\nIf you are puzzled by any fact connected with fantasy fiction, send\nyour questions in to us, and we will do our best to answer them. Any\nquestion sent in by you and not answered in this issue was received\ntoo late and will appear in our next issue.\n\n\n\n\nSTARTLING FACT\n\n\nMany readers have asked the Editor where they could secure such books\nas the \"Necronomicon,\" \"The Book of Eibon\" and other books of medieval\nsorcery mentioned in the stories of Clark Ashton Smith, H. P.\nLovecraft, and other authors of weird tales.\n\nUpon these requests, the Editor wrote to Clark Ashton Smith, inquiring\nof him whether these books had been translated into English as yet or\nnot, whereupon, Mr. Smith informs us as follows:\n\n\"'Necronomicon,' 'Book of Eibon,' etc., I am sorry to say, are all\nfictitious. Lovecraft invented the first, I the second. Howard, I\nbelieve, fathered the German work on the Nameless Cults. It is really\ntoo bad that they don't exist as objective, bonafide compilations of\nthe elder and darker Lore! I have been trying to remedy this, in some\nsmall measure, by cooking up a whole chapter of Eibon. It is still\nunfinished, and I am now entitling it 'The Coming of the White\nWorm'.... This worm mentioned in Eibon is Rlim Shaikorth, and comes\nfrom beyond the pole on a strange, gigantic iceberg with a temperature\nof absolute zero.\"\n\nWe'll bet that most Smith and Lovecraft fans really believed in the\nexistence of these books (as did the editor). A reader informs us that\nin the July issue of Weird Tales, these books were mentioned in three\nstories.\n\nThis incident only goes to prove that Smith and Lovecraft have the\ngift of creating the \"illusion of reality,\" the phrase defined in the\n1924 Anniversary Number of Weird Tales.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nUrge your friends to subscribe to TFF.\n\n\n\n\nANNALS OF THE JINNS\n\nby R. H. Barlow\n\n2--The Shadow From Above\n\n\nA midsummer day in the hamlet of Droom. The villagers went about their\nvarious tasks, and within the tiny market-square the spice-vendors and\nthe people from the hills with their exotic burdens of gay fruits\ncreated a pleasant hum of busy occupation. Sleeping dogs lay\ncontentedly in the warm sunlight, and the squat beasts of burden\nambled about peacefully upon their six clawless paws, their grotesque\nfaces slit with toad-like grins. All was, no one could have denied,\nentirely calm.\n\nThen one of the dogs lying in a doorway sprang suddenly and omitted a\nsharp bark. At the same moment a dark cloud apparently obscured the\nsun. In a short time it had passed unnoticed save for the dog. But his\nowner--an old crone in a voluminous black hood--peered intently at the\nclear and vacant sky, and started chattering in an excited tone. Soon\nthe whole population was out of doors looking upwards at that which\ncould not be seen yet which cast a deep shadow. Nothing was to be\nperceived in the expanse of blue, yet upon the square cobblestones of\nthe quaint little village an irregular black form wavered back and\nforth. Then it grew larger. Whatever it may have been, it was\nsettling. The people drew back afrightened. Slowly the swinging motion\nceased, and the thing drew near. A deep, heavy panting was distinctly\naudible, much like that of a great beast, and with a dull impact as\nthough it was of great weight, it alighted upon a grassy plot before\nthe Chancellor's house. For a long time it lay there, resting. And\nstill nothing could be seen save the indentation of the grass nor\naught heard but the heavy breathing.\n\nThen, to the terror of the white-faced and nervous citizens, it rose\non giant feet and tramped down a lane. Thud.... Thud.... Thud....\nThud.... The sound grew monotonous in its deliberation. Before its\npath lay a sleeping hound. It was lifted as if in a vast claw, and\nvanished among horrid rending sounds. A single drop of blood flecked\nthe earth.... Its taste momentarily sated, the thing paused and\nturned.\n\nIt took some moments for reason to replace the stark terror of the\ntownsfolk. Then there was a mad and frantic rush for the nearest\nhouses. Those to first gain entrance barred the doors upon their\ncomrades. In a moment the street was apparently bare--save for the\nunseen monster.\n\nAll that afternoon and night it pried at doors, scratched at roofs,\nmuzzled windows and upset fruits-carts inquiringly. But the people of\nDroom had built well. It did not gain entrance during the night,\nalthough few slept, when they heard the constant breathing before\ntheir homes, and the dull thumping sounds as it wreaked its malice\nupon the shops of the marketplace.\n\nIt was high noon before any dared unbar their doors and venture forth.\nNothing unusual greeted their blanched faces, and silently,\napprehensively they stole to their tasks. Soon all activity again\ncommenced.\n\nThe horror had gone.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nCome over to \"Our Readers Say\" and \"The Boiling Point\" and join in the\ncomment.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOILING POINT\n\n\nHerewith we continue the Ackerman-Smith debate, which is waxing hot.\n\n\"The Ackerman-Smith controversy assumes all the aspects of a mad\ncomedy. To assail and reprehend the writings of Clark Ashton Smith is\nas preposterous and futile as a dwarf transporting a huge mountain\npeak upon the tip of his tiny finger. Either Forrest J. Ackerman is\ndaft or an imbecile or a notoriety-seeking clown and knave. Clark\nAshton Smith stands alone in the realm of present-day weird and\nfantastic literature, and, therefore, above all his contemporaries. He\nis still King: and has yet to be dethrone.\"--Robert Nelson.\n\n\"Personally, I thought that 'The Light From Beyond' was very good, and\nI saw nothing weird about it. It was fantasy and not stf., but some of\nthe greatest classics of so-called science fiction have been almost\npure fantasy. Witness: Merritt's 'Snake Mother' and 'Moon Pool,' and\nTaine's 'Time Stream.' Ackerman's objections to this were particularly\nobnoxious to me, as I thought it one of the best stories ever written.\nCertainly, there should be something more to science fiction than\nrays, machines, villains, heroines (composed of lipstick and leg, as\nMr. Barlow rather bitterly expresses it), as has been stressed so\ngreatly of late. There should be an element of fantasy, strong\ncharacters, and a well-developed plot in addition. The lack of those\nis why so many weird story lovers (like Mr. Barlow) can find so much\nfault with stf. I do not blame him. I, myself, as a reader, will stop\nreading stf when the fantasy element is dropped completely.\" William\nCrawford.\n\n\n\n\nQUESTIONNAIRE\n\n\nHere are the answers to the questions we asked you in September. How\nmany could you answer without looking them up?\n\n1. David H. Keller's first story was \"The Revolt of the Pedestrians\"\nin the February, 1928 issue of Amazing.\n\n2. Tom Jenkins was the leading character in \"In 20,000 A.D.\" and \"Back\nto 20,000 A.D.\" by Schachner and Zagat, in the Sept., 1930 and March,\n1931 issues of Wonder, respectively.\n\n3. A. Hyatt Verrill lays most of his plots in Central and South\nAmerica.\n\n4. \"Through the Veil\" by Leslie F. Stone in May, 1930 Amazing, gave a\nscientific explanation of the fairy myth.\n\n5. Clement Fezandie wrote the \"Dr. Hackensaw's Secrets\" stories, a\nseries in the old Electrical Experimenter, and early issues of Science\nand Invention.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nNot so much in rebuttal to Mr. Ackerman as to toss another stick\nonto the fire, let me confess that the scientific fiction type of\nliterature seems to me among the dullest written. I avoid whenever\npossible, except in such cases where it passes the boundaries into\nthe weird and horrible. Of course, the work of Wells is an exception.\nThis may be blasphemy to most of your readers, but there it is. To\nreturn to Mr. Ackerman's complaint: I fail to see why it is any more\ndeplorable for Wonder Stories to publish Clark Ashton Smith's\nhorror story than for Weird Tales to publish Edmond Hamilton's\npseudo-scientific effusions. And it was Amazing Stories that had the\nhonor to publish \"The Colour Out of Space\" by America's master of the\nweird, Lovecraft. Richard E. Morse.\n\n\n\n\nA DREAM OF THE ABYSS\n\nby Clark Ashton Smith\n\n\n    I seemed at the sheer end:\n    Albeit mine eyes, in mystery and night\n    Shrouded as with the thick profundity of death,\n    Or as if underneath Lethean lentors drowned,\n    Saw never lamp nor star nor dead star's wraith of light,\n    Yet seemed I at the world's sheer end;\n    And fearfully and slowly I drew breath\n    From silent gulfs of all uncertainty and dread,\n    Precipitate to Nadir from around;\n    Nor trusted I on any side to tread\n    One pace, lest I should overstep the brink\n    And infinitely and forever sink\n    Past eye-shot of the Cyclopean sun,\n    When from the bulwark of the world adown oblivion,\n    He on the morrow should stare after me.\n\n    Swift from infinity,\n    The black, unformed, enormous Fear that lives between the stars,\n    Clutched with the cold, great darkness at my heart.\n    Then from the gulf arose a whispering,\n    And rustle as of Silence on the wing,\n    To stay and stand\n    Anear at my right hand:\n    What Powers abysmal, born o' the blind black air,\n    What nameless demons of the nether deep\n    That 'scape the sun and from the moonlight live apart,\n    Came and conspired against me there\n    I heard not, ere the whispering\n    Ceased, and a heavier darkness seemed to spring\n    Upon me, and I felt the silence leap\n    And clasp me closer, and the sweep\n    Of all the abyss reach up and drag\n    Body and feet from the crumbling uttermost crag\n    To the plumb and infinite emptiness unknown:\n    Nor knew I, in tumult of the rapid air,\n    If me did Azrael or Abaddon bear,\n    Or if I fell alone.\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO COLLECT FANTASY FICTION\n\nby Julius Schwartz\n\nPart Three\n\n\nVolume one number one of Mind Magic, a magazine dealing with the\noccult, was June, 1931. It lasted until the end of the year, December,\n1931 issue. (The last two issues were published under the title of My\nSelf Magazine.) Another science fiction magazine, Miracle, Science and\nFantasy Stories, disappeared after issuing two numbers, the April-May\nand June-July, 1931. The same publisher of this magazine, Harry\nHershey, printed some good fantasies in Ghost Stories. Exact dates of\nthis magazine are unknown to the writer, but the magazine gave up its\nghost sometime in 1932.\n\nHugo Gernsback, editor of Wonder Stories, put out two magazines that\nexpired within a year. The first, Air Wonder Stories (July, 1929 to\nMay, 1930) dealt with aviation of the future, mostly. It combined with\nScience and Wonder Stories in June, 1930 to form the present Wonder\nStories. The other, Scientific Detective Monthly, appeared in January,\n1930, and after changing its name to Amazing Detective Tales in June\ncollapsed with the October, 1930 issue.\n\nOriental Stories, companion magazine to Weird Tales, burst forth on\nthe stands September 15, 1930. Some excellent weird and oriental tales\nmade their appearance in this magazine, which afterwards, in January,\n1933, became Magic Carpet. Black Cat magazine (published around 1924)\nhad some weird and scientifiction stories. These issues are\nparticularly hard to obtain.\n\n\n\n\nCLUB NEWS\n\n\nThe Fantasy Fan Fraternity, announced in our September issue, is now\nwell under way, with members in nine different states. The purpose of\nthe organization is to foster fellowship among science-fiction fans by\nmeans of correspondence, or where possible, by personal contact in\nlocal groups or chapters.\n\nThe first such chapter has been established in New York City, where\nthe Scienceers, first fan club of its kind, is functioning as the\nlocal Fraternity branch. Meetings are held every week; and membership\nis open to all metropolitan fans.

When she died, she was not missed, but her spirit haunted\nher home every night. After a number of years someone saw her approach\none side of a room and paw at a wall. Then she disappeared. The wall\nwas removed and many valuable papers were discovered, including one\nthat proved she had murdered her husband. Her ghost never appeared\nafter that. It seemed that at last she had repented her evil\nexistence, and was trying to redeem her soul.\n\nThe guard of the London prison tower was making one of his nightly\nrounds when he discovered a peculiar light emanating from the utmost\ntower. Upon climbing up he noticed that it was an unearthly blue-white\nlight which permeated everything within, but seemed to have no point\nof origin. Within this baleful gleam he saw the spirits of those that\nhad died in the London tower through the ages--warriors of the time of\nHenry the Eighth--and noblemen of all periods. They were marching in a\nsolemn procession. Suddenly everything faded and the guard found\nhimself in utter darkness.\n\nThere are many other ghost stories of London--such as phantom hands\nappearing above the water of the Thames, sworn to by witnesses to be\ngospel truth--but our reason forces us to reject them.\n\nRecently, the noted Weird Tales author, Elliott O'Donnell, released\nhis book, \"Ghosts of London,\" which relates further tales of this\nnature.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nSCIENCE FICTION IN ENGLISH MAGAZINES\n\nby Bob Tucker\n\n(Series Three)\n\n\nAn all-science-weird magazine started in England to last for just one\nissue. The title was \"Argo Weekly.\" The number contained various stf\nstories concerning everything from prehistoric animals to the \"End of\nthe World.\"\n\nA late September number of \"The Wizard\" carried a fair story of\nanother Martian invasion entitled \"Raiders from the Red World.\" The\ninvaders landed among the native tribes of Africa, instead of New York\nCity, the usual landing place. And, incidentally, they were not slugs,\ngiants, or etc., but just ordinary human beings.\n\n\"The Skipper\" published a humorous story named \"Ginger Snapp.\" In this\ntale, an old professor invents a contrivance that emits a ray which\ndisintegrates metal by the push of a button. More rays! The\nprofessor's son is surprised to see his dinner disappear while\nmonkeying with the mechanism.\n\nAs a rule, English magazines have covers that would make Buffalo Bill\nor Nick Carter quit work. They are very \"dime novelish\" at times, and\ngo to extremes to amaze the reader.\n\nA request has come in for a female stf enthusiast, who would\ncorrespond with American readers, so here she is, to you who wish a\nforeign penpal: Miss Molly Upchurch, 139 Byron Rd., Small Heath,\nBirmingham, 10, England.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nJoin \"The Fantasy Fan Fraternity.\" See the \"Club News\" in this issue\nfor complete information.\n\n\n\n\nMY SCIENCE FICTION COLLECTION\n\nby Forrest J. Ackerman\n\nPart Three\n\n\nReposing in a futuristic box are ninety-six autographs. Cummings,\nFlagg, Olsen, Repp, the three Smiths, Taine, Keller, Breuer, Hamilton,\nMerritt, Coblentz, Burks, Williamson, Farley, Meek, Paul, Morey,\nWesso, Verrill, Leinster--and half a hundred more. Also, there is a\nspecial collection of scientifilm actors' autographs. These are more\ndifficult to obtain, and some necessitate writing abroad, but to date\nI have \"The Frankenstein Monster,\" the heroine of \"Tarzan,\" J-21 and\nLN-18 of \"Just Imagine,\" the director of \"By Rocket to the Moon\" and\n\"Metropolis,\" \"Dracula,\" Roxor of \"Chandu,\" and many others too\nnumerous to mention. Tho not a part of the collection, it may prove\ninteresting to readers that I have seen in person \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr.\nHyde,\" \"Dracula,\" \"Dr. Moreau,\" and \"Chandu\" (Frederic March, Bela\nLugosi, Charles Laughton and Edmund Lowe).\n\nI have autographed photographs from Leslie F. Stone, \"Doc\" Smith, Ed\nEarl Repp, Capt. S. P. Meek, Miles J. Breuer, Victor Rousseau, Sewell\nPeaslee, Charles Willard Diffin, Edmond Hamilton and others. Mr.\nWright presented me with a personal sketch of his \"Retired Commander\nHanson.\"\n\nI also have photos from the heroine of \"High Treason,\"\nFrankenstein--the creator, and Fritz Lang, director of German\nscientifilms.\n\n(Next month Mr. Ackerman tells of his collection of original\nmanuscripts.)\n\n\n\n\nCONGLAMITORIAL\n\n\nSecond in the series.... And speaking of the April 1933 Amazing,\n\"Martian and Troglodyte,\" by Neil R. Jones was printed on the cover,\nbut the story did not appear in the issue. The printing of the\neditorial, which took two more pages than hitherto, and some of the\nDiscussions were increased in size.... The May 1933 Amazing was the\nfirst one of 86 not to contain part of a serial. The August-September\nhad none either.... Have you ever wondered what letter of the alphabet\nauthors pick on most as the first one in the title of their stories\n(omitting articles 'a,' 'the,' and 'an,')? Of course you haven't.\nWell, I'll tell you, anyway. An average of one-tenth of all the\nstories written begin with the letter \"M,\" and another tenth with \"S.\"\nThat is their rating in a collection of over 2000 stories.... So,\nAmazing is trying to get rid of the word \"scientifiction\" that\nGernsback coined, eh?... By the looks of the contents page of the May\n1933 Weird, you would think that every story was complete.... The May,\n1926 Amazing contains two stories by Jules Verne.... And the March\n1930 Science Wonder had two stories by Frank J. Brueckel.... And you\ncan find other similar cases, such as the Amazing Annual containing\ntwo stories by A. Merritt, and the June, 1930 Astounding with two of\nDiffin's yarns (one under the pseudonym of C. D. Willard).\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nIf you have any original fan material on hand, we would be pleased to\nhave you submit it for our serious consideration.\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO WRITE A STF STORY\n\nby Hoy Ping Pong\n\n\nThe first thing to remember in writing a science story is originality.\nYou must have that, so the first things to select for your brain-child\nis a hero, heroine, and villain. No plot is needed. Or, if you desire\none, that can be thot up after the story is finished.\n\nHave your hero a tall, slim, cold, grey-eyed chap, with an iron jaw,\nand a sturdy body. He also must know all there is to know about\neverything. Now for the heroine; she must be a small, slim blond,\nblue-eyed, and be a scientist's daughter. That's the big point in\noriginality. Nobody has ever thought of her being a scientist's\ndaughter before. Now next comes the villain. He must be tall, dark,\nwith snapping black eyes, and a brush across his upper lip. He must\nhave an impossible name that no one can pronounce, including yourself.\nI would suggest someone who desires to have world domination. That,\nalso, is original.\n\nThe big surprise of your story is this: Your villain must desire the\nheroine for himself. That is something that is new to STF readers.\nAnd, of course, I would politely suggest that the hero also want the\ngirl. That would make a triangle out of it. The hero must chase the\nvillain all over the universe, because the villain has the heroine in\nhis vile clutches. Don't forget the word vile. Nobody has ever used\nthat.\n\nOf course, the invaders from Mars arrive on the scene about this time,\nalso desiring world conquest. It would be a nice point of originality\nhere to have the villain throw in with the Martians. It wouldn't do to\nhave the whole army overthrow the enemy. The hero must do it himself,\nsinglehanded.\n\nAnd, a few death rays can be used in the story. Select a fitting\ncolor, (some authors prefer pink). I would suggest lavender, which\nwould just match the heroine's pocketbook, and have it wipe out\nmillions by merely a few puffs. However, if you could do it all in a\npuff and a half, that would merit you another point. Then you must\nhave the hero invent a ray that stops the lavender death rays. Yellow\nwould be best for this. It makes such an excellent color scheme.\n\nThrow in a few space ships, a couple fights, a shot in the dark, four\nor five corpses, a high official who turns traitor, a last flight for\nhelp, and end it up with a lone man battling hundreds. Mix thoroughly,\nand type out on paper, forgetting to double space your lines, as all\neditors request that you doublespace, thereby showing them that you\nare really original.\n\nNo plot is needed, as mentioned in paragraph one, but if you want one,\nread one of Grimm's Fairy Tales, and borrow a plot. It makes no\ndifference what kind, as they are all fairy tales, anyway. As a final\nbit of advice, fold the manuscript several times, and send it to the\neditor with no enclosed postage for its return. By doing this the\neditor will not have to go to the trouble of returning it to you, and,\nso long as the Chief Waste Paper Basket Monitor doesn't get snoopy and\nstart reading the refuse, there will be no ill effects on\nanyone--(providing the editor hadn't read it in the first place--and\nin the case that he did--well, there's places for people like that.\nNew editors are cheap nowadays, anyway.)\n\n\n\n\nFAMOUS FANTASY FANS\n\n2--Conrad H. Ruppert\n\n\nHeart disease was CHR's means of becoming introduced to science\nfiction. Confined to bed he was given a copy of Science and Invention\nwhich he read and re-read many times, liking its science fiction\nstory, \"The Man on the Meteor\" by Ray Cummings, best of all. He never\nlost one whit of his interest in fantasy fiction, and has become a\nkeen judge of what is best in this field.\n\nAlways retiring in nature, he first came to notice in a vigorous\ncampaign he conducted for increasing the membership of the\nInternational Scientific Association, and for innovating a Science\nFiction Week. Hugo Gernsback was so pleased with this latter idea, and\nwith CHR's work in trying to put it over, that CHR was awarded a $50\nprize in the \"What I Have Done for Science Fiction\" contest that\nScience Wonder Quarterly conducted at that time.\n\nHis pet idea for many years was to issue a science fiction fan\nmagazine. The Depression decided him upon the desperate expedient of\nlaunching the SCIENCE FICTION DIGEST without adequate preparation.\nUnwilling to take any credit for the work he appointed Maurice Z.\nIngher as the Digest's editor, but when Mr. Ingher was forced to\nresign because of other duties, he reluctantly took the editorship.\nThere is plenty of testimony to satisfy all as to the success he has\nattained with his little magazine, the SCIENCE FICTION DIGEST.\n\nAs for his age, and other personal points, he is 21, unmarried, and\nconsiders life quite thrilling. He is a printer by occupation, being\none of the partners of the ARRA Printers, who have given the fans\nseveral science fiction pamphlets.\n\nThough he declares he is not modest, he cannot be convinced that he\nhas done anything unusual. It is his courage and determination that\nhas carried the 'Science Fiction Digest' through the rough spots of\nits career, and it is stern judgement that selects the articles and\nstories which so please the readers of SFD, or FANTASY Magazine, as it\nwill be called.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nThe word \"weird\" as meaning bizarre probably originated with Edgar\nAllan Poe, who was one of the greatest coiner of words. Is his poem\n\"Ulalume,\" he speaks of the country of \"Weir\" from which the word\n\"weird\" was derived to describe anything horrible or unique.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nCome over to \"Our Readers Say\" and \"The Boiling Point\" and join in the\ncomment.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
