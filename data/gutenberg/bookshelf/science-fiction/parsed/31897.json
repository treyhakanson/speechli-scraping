FISHER\n\nILLUSTRATED by SUMMERS\n\n\nOn the sixty-third floor of the Empire State Building is, among others\nof its type, a rather small office consisting of two rooms connected by\na stout wooden door. The room into which the office door, which is of\nopaque glass, opens, is the smaller of the two and serves to house a\nreceptionist, three not-too-comfortable armchairs, and a disorderly,\nhomogeneous mixture of _Life's_, _Look's_ and _New Yorker's_.\n\n[Illustration: Donald was determined to make Mimi go back to their\nworld--dead or alive!]\n\nThe receptionist is a young woman, half-heartedly pretty but certainly\nchic in the manner of New York's women in general and of its working\nwomen in particular, perhaps in her middle twenties, with a paucity of\ngolden hair which is kept clinging rather back on her skull by an\nintricate network of tortoise-shell combs and invisible pins. She is\nengaged to a man who is in turn engaged in a position for an advertising\nfirm just thirty-seven stories directly below her. Her name is Margaret.\nShe often, in periods when the immediate consummation of the work on her\ndesk is not of paramount importance, as is often the case, gazes\nsomnolently at the floor beside her large walnut desk, hoping to catch a\nlurking image of her beloved only thirty-seven stories away. She rarely\nsucceeds in viewing him through the intervening spaces, but she does not\ntire of trying; it is a pleasant enough diversion. There is an\nelectronics firm just five stories above her fiance, and perhaps, she\nreasons, there is interference of a sort here. Someday maybe she will\ncatch them with all their tubes off. Margaret is a romantic, but she is\nengaged and thus is entitled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeyond the entrance that is guarded by the stout wooden door is a larger\nroom, darker, quieter, one step more removed from the hurrying hallway.\nA massive but neat desk is placed before the one set of windows, the\nblinds of which are kept closed but tilted toward the sky so that an\naura of pale light is continually seeping through. The main illumination\ncomes from several lamps placed in strategic corners, their bulbs turned\naway from the occupants of the room.\n\nTo one side of the desk is a comfortable-looking deep chair, with\nleather arms and a back quite high enough to support one's head. In\nfront of this is the traditional couch, armless but well-upholstered and\ncomfortable. At the moment Dr. Victor Quink was sitting not in the deep\nchair but in the swivel chair behind the desk. His glasses were lying on\nthe desk next to his feet, the chair was pushed back as far as it might\nsafely be, his arms were stretched out to their extremity, and his mouth\nwas straining open, as if to split his cheeks. Dr. Quink was yawning.\n\nHis method of quick relaxation was that of the blank mind; he was at\nthis very moment forcibly evicting all vestiges of thought from his\nhead; he was concentrating intently on black, on depth, on absolute\nsilence. He was able to maintain this discipline for perhaps a second,\nor a second and a half at most, and then his mind began, imperceptibly\nat the first, to slip off along a path of its own liking, leading Dr.\nQuink quietly and unprotestingly along. The path is narrow, crinkly,\nbending back upon itself. It is not a path for vehicles, but one worn by\na single pair of boots, plodding patiently, slowly, wearily. The path\nruns, or creeps, through a wild and desolate district where hardly more\nthan a single blade of grass shoots up at random from the bottomless\ndrift-sand. Instead of the garden that normally embellishes a castle\n(there is in the vague distance a blurred castle), the fortified walls\nare approached on the landward side by a scant forest of firs, on the\nother by the snow-swept Baltic Sea. Spanish moss hangs limply from the\nevergrays, disdainful of the sun and of its reflection by sea; the\nscene is somber and restful, serene, and flat.\n\nThe buzzer rang once, twice.\n\nDr. Quink brought his feet down to their more dignified position, out of\nsight beneath his desk. His conscious once more took hold of his mind,\nonly vaguely aware that it had not been able to achieve the incognito\nserenity it sought. He put on his glasses and the heavy wooden door\nopened and a man walked through.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe carried his hat in both hands, he was nervous, he was out of his\nelement. He looked to both sides as he came past the doorway, and when\nMargaret closed the door behind him he jumped, though nearly\nimperceptibly, and advanced toward the desk. \"I'm not sure at all I\nshould have come here,\" he said.\n\nDr. Quink nodded, but said nothing. He judged the man to be on the order\nof thirty or thirty-one. His hair was black, curly, and sparse; perhaps\nbalding, perhaps not.\n\n\"You see, I can't be quite candid with you. Nothing personal, of course.\nIt just ... Oh, this is frightfully embarrassing,\" he said, taking a\nseat before the desk at Dr. Quink's waved invitation. \"I just thought\nthat perhaps, even without knowing all the details, you might be able to\neffect merely a _tempo_rary cure. So that I can get her back home, to\nour _own_ doctors. Nothing personal, of course. I do hope I don't offend\nyou.\"\n\n\"Not at all, I assure you,\" Dr. Quink assured him. \"Just whom did you\nmean by her?\"\n\n\"Why, my wife.\" He looked at Quink quizzically for a moment, then with\nsudden fresh embarrassment. \"Oh, of course. You naturally assume that it\nwas _I_ who is ... um, in need of treatment. No, no, you couldn't be\nmore wrong. No, it is my wife. Yes, I've come to see you on her account.\nYou see, of course, she wouldn't come herself. Ah, this is rather\nawkward, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Quink answered. \"If you would just tell me what your\nwife's trouble is?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. You have to know that, at least, don't you? I mean, do\nyou? You couldn't possibly just treat her on general principles, so to\nspeak, without being told of the immediate symptoms? You don't, I take\nit, have any technique that would correspond to penicillin, and just\nsort of clear things up in her head at random?\"\n\nDr. Quink assured him that it was necessary, in psychiatry at least, to\ndetermine the disease before curing it.\n\n\"I suppose so,\" the gentleman said. \"Incidentally, my name is Fairfield.\nDonald Fairfield. Did I mention that? But of course, you have all that\non your little card there, don't you? Yes, I thought so. I do hope your\nsecretary's handwriting is legible, it doesn't seem so from this angle.\nBy the way, did you know that she is prone to staring at the floor? A\nspot right next to her desk. The right-hand side. I think I never should\nhave come here.\"\n\nDr. Quink reassured him that he was free to leave at any moment, never\nto return. By a longish glance at the wall clock, in fact, Dr. Quink\ngave him to understand that he might do so with no hard feelings left\nbehind. Mr. Fairfield, however, gathered his resources and plunged\nforward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I think you'll find this a rather interesting case, Doctor. Most\nunusual. Of course, I have little notion of the variety of situations\none comes into contact with in your line of work, still I have every\nreason to believe this will come as a bit of a shock. I wonder just how\ndogmatic you are in your convictions?\"\n\nDr. Quink raised his eyebrows and made no answer; he was desperately\nstifling a yawn.\n\n\"I mean no intrusion on your religious life, by any means. Not at all.\nNo, that is the furthest thought from my mind, I assure you. No, I am\nconcerned at the moment with my wife's problems, meaning no disrespect\nto yourself at all, sir. I merely asked, not out of idle curiosity, but\nbecause ... Doctor, I suppose there's no way for it but to explain.\" He\ngestured with his hat toward the desk calendar between him and Quink.\n\"This is the year 1959, correct? Well, you see, sir, the fact of the\nmatter is that I just wasn't _born_ in 1959.\"\n\nHe stopped there, and the room relapsed into silence.\n\nDr. Quink looked at him for a few moments, but no explanatory statement\nwas forthcoming. Dr. Quink removed his eyeglasses, opened his left\ndrawer two from the top, removed a white wiper, and wiped his glasses\ncarefully. Mr. Fairfield waited patiently. Dr. Quink replaced the\nglasses. He leaned forward across the desk.\n\n\"Mr. Fairfield,\" he said, \"this may come as some shock to you, but _I_\nwasn't born this year either.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" Mr. Fairfield wailed. \"Oh, I just _knew_ I\nshouldn't have come. When I say I wasn't _born_--\"\n\nHe stopped, at a loss to explain. He wrung his hat in his hands until it\nwas crumpled probably beyond repair. Then he jumped up, pushed it onto\nhis head, and quickly walked out of the office. As his back disappeared\nfrom the doorway Margaret's head poked up in its place. She looked quite\nstartled.\n\n\"It's all right, Margaret,\" Victor Quink said. \"He was just a bit upset.\nYou get all kinds in here. This one claimed there's something abnormal\nwith his _wife_. Better leave an hour free tomorrow. He'll come back.\"\n\nBut he didn't.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe didn't come back during the following three weeks, then one afternoon\nMargaret ushered him through the doorway. He walked to the chair before\nthe desk, looking neither at the doctor nor to the right nor left, and\nsat down, holding his hat in his hands.\n\n\"My wife believes she's just,\" he waved his hat vaguely toward the\nshielded window, \"just like everybody else here.\"\n\n\"And isn't she?\" Doctor Quink queried, with the patience due his\nprofession.\n\n\"No, she isn't. But she's forgotten. She hasn't _really_ forgotten. I\ndon't know your technical terminology; she refuses to remember. Oh,\n_you_ know. Her subconscious, or unconscious, or whatever, is blinding\nher. She won't face reality. And it's time for us to go back. But she\nwon't budge. She claims she's normal, and I'm the one who's crazy. In\nfact, she was very happy that I was coming to see you today. I _told_\nher I was going to see you, but she persisted in insisting that I was\ncoming here because _I_ needed help. She said I'm coming to you because\nsubconsciously I know I need you. Well, enough of that. I'm here because\nwe have to go home, and if you could just make her face life long enough\nto admit that, I'm sure that when we do get home our doctors will have\nno difficulty with her case. It won't be so bizarre to them, of course,\nas it must seem to you.\"\n\n\"Frankly, Mr. Fairfield,\" Dr. Quink said, \"you're not being entirely\nclear in this matter. First of all, you say you have to go home. You're\nnot a native of New York then?\"\n\n\"A native? How quaintly you put it, Doctor. You might better say a\nsavage, mightn't you? But that's neither here nor there. I am, of\ncourse, a native, as you say, of New York. I thought I explained last\ntime. I am simply not of this _time_.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDoctor Quink slowly shook his shaggy head. \"I'm afraid the precise\nmeaning of your phrase escapes me, Mr. Fairfield.\"\n\n\"I am not of this _time_, Doctor. Nor is my wife. We are from ... well,\nfrom the future.\"\n\n\"From very _far_ in the future?\" Quink asked quietly.\n\n\"Quite far. I'm not sure just exactly _how_ far. Systems of time\nmeasurement have changed, you understand, between our time and this, so\nthat the calculations become rather involved, though, of course, only\nsuperficially.\"\n\n\"Of course. Quite understandable.\"\n\n\"Quite. You _are_ being understanding about this. Much better than I had\nhoped for, actually. At any rate, let's get on with it. For some obscure\nreason my wife has fled reality, and now that our vacation is up she\nrefuses to return with me, stating flatly that she has never, to make a\nlong story short, traveled through time--except, of course, at the\nnormal velocity with which we all progress in the course of things--and\nthat it is I who am out of my head and though, while not actually\ntroublesome, it would be thoughtful of me to see a doctor or at least to\nshut up about this nonsense before the neighbors hear me. Could you see\nher tomorrow evening? She'd never come here, feeling as she does, but I\nthought if you would come to dinner you might hypnotize her unawares\nor--\"\n\n\"I don't think that's feasible under the circum--\"\n\n\"Isn't it really? I'm afraid I don't know much about this sort of thing.\nI'm quite helpless in this affair, really. I assure you I was driven to\ndesperation to tell you all this; I mean, you must understand that\nabsolute silence, secrecy, that is, is our most absolute sacred rule.\nPerhaps you could just slip something into her drink, knock her out, so\nto speak, and I could then bodily take her back--\"\n\n\"Mr. Fairfield,\" Dr. Quink felt it necessary to interrupt, \"you must\nunderstand that it would not be ethical for me to do as you suggest. Now\nit seems to me that the essence of your wife's peculiarity lies in her\nrelationship with you, her husband. So if you don't mind, perhaps we\nmight talk about you for a while. It might be more comfortable for you\non the couch. Please, it doesn't obligate you in any way. Yes, that's\nmuch better, isn't it. And I'll sit here, if I may. Now, then, go on,\njust tell me all about yourself. Go on just start talking. You'll find\nit'll come by itself after you get started.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I suppose I asked for this. I mean, coming here as I did. I don't know\nwhat else I could have done, though. They prepare one for every\nemergency, as well, of course, as one can foresee the future, which is\nin this case actually the past, speaking chronologically. Your\nchronology, that is, not ours. I'm sure you follow me, though it seems\nto me I'm talking in circles. Are we accomplishing very much, do you\nthink?\"\n\n\"We mustn't be impatient,\" Dr. Quink said. \"These things come slowly,\nthey take time, if you'll pardon the expression. But of course, it's\nimpudent of _me_ to lecture _you_ on temporal effects.\"\n\n\"Not at all, not at all, I assure you. I am no expert on the time\ncontinuum, no expert in the slightest. I daresay I don't understand the\nmost basic principles behind it, just as you aren't required to\nunderstand electromagnetic theory in order to flick on the electric\nlight. In fact, I believe it wasn't even necessary for Edison to\nunderstand it in order to invent the damned thing.\"\n\n\"You know about Edison then?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly. I've studied up quite a bit on this section of our\nhistory.\"\n\n\"You're sure,\" Dr. Quink went on, \"that you simply didn't learn about\nEdison in grammar school?\"\n\n\"Quite. Oh, yes, quite. No offense meant, sir, but you must certainly\nrealize that between my time and this there have been a great many\ndiscoveries in the manifold fields embraced by science, so that people\nwho in your own time were famous to schoolchildren are now, then, that\nis,--oh, I hope you know what I mean--known only to scholars of the\nperiod involved. In the time to which I belong the schoolchildren may\nknow of Newton, Einstein and Fisher, but of such lesser luminaries as\nEdison, or even Avogadro or Galdeen, they are quite ignorant.\"\n\n\"Galdeen?\"\n\n\"Yes, Galdeen. Surely you know of Galdeen. Perhaps I'm mispronouncing\nit. Oh, damn. I'm actually rather proud of my knowledge of your\nhistories, I hate to be tripped up on something like this. Galineed,\nperhaps?\"\n\n\"Well, it's not worth bothering about.\"\n\n\"Damned annoying, just the same. It's on the tip of my tongue. Galeel?\"\n\n\"Would you mind very much if we went on to some other subject? I don't\nthink we're gaining much right here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You're the doctor, you know,\" Fairfield replied. \"I was just explaining\nhow I knew about Edison, though I never attended grammar school in this\ncentury. So, then, where were we? You asked me to tell you about myself,\ndidn't you? You know, I'd much rather you told me about yourself.\"\nFairfield suddenly sat upright on the couch, drew his legs up to his\nchest, crossed his ankles, and hugged his knees. \"I was noticing that\npicture you have hanging on the wall,\" he said. \"The sea, la mer, das\nWeltmeer, te misralub, et cetera. The roaring, crashing waves, the\nbubbling, foaming spray. The deep dank mystery of the green wet sea.\nMarvelous, marvelous. Do you indulge in sex? I mean you, personally, of\ncourse, not as a representative of your species.\"\n\nVictor Quink laid down his pad in his lap. \"I'm not married, Mr.\nFairfield,\" he said. \"Do you often ask such questions of people you've\nrecently met?\"\n\n\"The sun came up this morning, Dr. Quink,\" Fairfield answered jovially,\n\"the sun came up. You'll pardon my answer, of course, I was merely\ntrying to top your own non sequitur. Many of your people do indulge,\nyou know. In fact, it would seem, from my own necessarily limited\nobservations, that it is more universal in its appeal than any of your\nother sports. Do you classify it as a sport? It's amazing, really, how\nthese simple connections escape one until one tries to formulate one's\nrecollections into a consistent line of reasoning. Have you ever\nnoticed? Of course, though, you do it for procreation, don't you? _Now_\nI mean you as a representative of your species, naturally. Seeing as you\nare not married, eh, doctor,\" and he winked at Quink. \"It seems to me,\nhowever, and again I insist that I am no expert in the field, however\nit does seem to me that this matter of procreation is in many cases\njust an excuse; there seems to be an inherent taste for mating per se,\nor wouldn't you agree?\"\n\n\"You seem to take a disinterested view of the whole business, Mr.\nFairfield. Do _you_, ah, indulge?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. I couldn't, thank you just the same. I'm\nreally flattered, believe me I am, but thank you, no.\"\n\n\"That was _not_ an invitation, Mr. Fairfield,\" Dr. Quink put in, \"I was\ntrying to--\"\n\n\"Galui?\"\n\n\"Mr. Fairfield, I was trying to ascertain whether or not you lead an\nactive sex life, or whether your interest is purely, shall we say,\nmetaphysical?\"\n\n\"Yes, let's do say metaphysical. Rather clever of you, applying the term\nto sex that way. My estimation of your capabilities shoots up a notch or\ntwo, Dr. Quink.\"\n\n\"You mean to say,\" Dr. Quink kept up, \"that you do not participate in\nthe physical ramifications?\"\n\n\"Oh, you _do_ have a turn for words, Doctor. No, of course not. None of\nus do.\"\n\n\"By _us_ you mean your cohorts in the future?\"\n\n\"Exactly. You have an analytical mind, keen, keen. We do not die, we do\nnot give birth. And I never would have brought the whole morbid subject\nup except that it has a direct bearing on Mimi's trouble. So it is\nnecessary that you realize that sex is entirely foreign to us.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Dr. Quink, \"if what you say is true, your physical, let us\nsay, equipment, must have degenerated. And so a simple physical\nexamination--\"\n\n\"Evolution is slow, my doctor, slow, slow, slow. No, I'm physically\nindistinguishable from you. Assuming normalcy on your part, of course.\nTo continue along this train of thought, though, it is the mental\nprocess that provides the difference. There is no desire in me or mine,\nDoctor, no urge, no depravity, no sexual hunger. It simply died out over\nthe eons.\"\n\n\"Since it was no longer necessary,\" Quink prodded him.\n\n\"Or vice versa. With the urge dying, it might have been necessary for us\nto circumvent the entire business. An academic question, really. The\nchicken or the egg all over again. But since we have conquered time, so\nto speak, it must have occurred to you that there is no need for us to\ndie, and thus no need for birth.\"\n\n\"You are immortal, then,\" Dr. Quink said, scribbling in his note pad.\n\nMr. Fairfield shrugged. \"It beats sex. Which brings us to the problem we\nare discussing, if we can forget myself for a few moments. Mimi seems to\nhave been awakened to the sexual urge, and that provides an embarrassing\nsituation. Of course, its real significance is in relation to her\nproblem as a whole, in the illumination it sheds upon her neurosis, yet\nin itself it is, as I say, embarrassing. Coupled with my complete\nindifference, I mean. Have you any plans for this evening? Perhaps you\ncould dine with us without delay?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Quink would not ordinarily have accepted such an invitation, being\nof that class of physician which believes a disease, be it physical or\nmental, best treated in the antiseptic confines of the office or\nhospital. Mr. Fairfield, however, struck him as being the altogether\nunprepossessing possessor of an altogether distinguished psychosis. He\nwas, in fact, rapidly supplanting in Dr. Quink's estimation his previous\nfavorite. Already Dr. Quink was writing, mentally of course, the\nintroduction to the paper he would present to his professional journal.\n\nThroughout the automobile ride out to Long Island Donald Fairfield was\nquiet as, both hands tightly on the steering wheel of his new Buick, he\nalternately fought and coasted with the east-bound traffic. Dr. Quink\nforced himself to relax, to ignore the ins and outs of the commuters'\nraceway. He folded his arms across his chest, slumped down in his seat\nwith his legs stretched out as far as they would reach, and observed the\nfacial contortions of his driver-patient.\n\nFairfield's lips would twitch as he twisted the wheel and shot into the\nleft lane. His foot pressed down on the gas and the right corner of his\nlip pulled back in sneering response, the sudden surge of the Buick\nseemed intimately linked to one muscular act no more than to the other.\nHis eyebrows pressed intensely together, caressing one another, as the\nbig car whipped back into line. A sharp outlet of breath between tightly\nclenched teeth preceded the sharper blast of the horn and then the Buick\nwas swerving out to the left again with the accompanying lip twitch. A\ncar they were about to pass pulled out in front of them, initiating a\nspasmodic clutching of the wheel by the left hand, a furious pounding on\nthe horn by the right, and a synchronized twitch, sneer, and muttered\n\"goddam it\" from the lips, repeated twice while the eyebrows maintained\ntheir position of togetherness.\n\nDr. Quink closed his eyes finally. There was nothing more to be gained\nat the moment from observation. The patient's responses while driving\nwere normal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMrs. Fairfield greeted them at the door with a martini pitcher in one\nhand and a modernistically designed apron around her waist. She uttered\nlittle squeals about them being early and ushered them into the living\nroom where she settled Dr. Quink on one end of an eight-foot powder blue\ndivan before she left the room with the martini pitcher still clutched\ntightly in the one hand, the other rapidly undoing the apron of\nmodernistic design. Donald Fairfield had not said one word since the\nfront door had opened in response to their ring; none had seemed to have\nbeen necessary nor, in fact, possible, under the deluge of Mrs.\nFairfield's effusive greeting. Now he sat in the tilted green armchair\nin one corner of the room and, closing his eyes, relaxed from the strain\nof the drive.\n\n\"Your wife is very pretty,\" Dr. Quink said.\n\n\"Yes, she's probably the most beautiful woman I know,\" Fairfield said.\n\"That's probably why I took her along. There's something about a\nbeautiful woman.... It was certainly a mistake.\"\n\n\"Feminine beauty is enjoyable even though you don't indulge in sex?\"\n\n\"Of course, it is,\" he replied, with a gesture of annoyance. \"You're\nstill bound by that Freed--Freud, is it?--of yours. Damn him. That's\nreally the main reason I hesitated so long before I brought her case to\nyou. I was afraid you were going to place too much emphasis on the\nsexual aspects which, of course, by your standards are abnormal. It has\nreally nothing to do with the problem, and I wish you'd forget about it,\nbut I suppose you can't. To you, her sexual instincts will be normal and\nit will be _mine_ which will appear abnormal, whereas in reality, of\ncourse, it's the other way around. You'll never cure her, I can see that\nnow. But then, you don't have to really _cure_ her. If you can just get\nher to admit the truth for just a moment or two, just temporarily, I can\nget her back to some really competent men. No reflection on your ability\nmeant, you know. I realize you're the best available in this age,\nnaturally.\"\n\n\"Naturally.\"\n\n\"But you can't know that, can you? Well, take my word for it, you are.\nSo suppose you start acting like it and get to work on her, eh? Could it\nbe Gilui? No.\"\n\nDr. Quink bent over and tied his shoelace once or twice before he\nreplied. He would have to talk to Mrs. Fairfield in private, of course,\nMr. Fairfield could understand that, of course, it was not that Dr.\nQuink did not want Mr. Fairfield around when the discussion took place\nbut simply that one could not achieve rapport without absolute\nconfidence and, of course, privacy.\n\n\"Of course,\" Mr. Fairfield agreed. \"I'll go up and shower now, perhaps\nI'll take a bit of a nap before dinner. I'd like to avoid that horrible\nliquid she was stirring up when we came in anyhow. Somewhere she's\npicked up the idea that one should offer those things to dinner guests,\nand I can't stand them. Will you want a pen and some notepaper?\"\n\nWhen he had left the room to tread up the stairs one at a time, leaning\nheavily on the cast-iron bannister but making no sound on the\nwall-to-wall carpeting, Dr. Quink leaned back and had barely time to\npass his hand wearily over his eyes in a circular motion that he found\nsoothing when Mrs. Fairfield entered from behind a swinging door bearing\na small circular tray on which were balanced the aforementioned martini\npitcher and two high-stemmed glasses, properly frosted and rounded with\nlemon.\n\n\"Has he left already?\" she asked. \"Well, shall we get right down to\nbusiness? You call me Mimi and I'll call you Victor. What did you think\nof his story? Pretty wild, isn't it? But he's harmless, I'm sure. I'm\nnot in the least bit afraid of him. Do you think I should be?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVictor smiled and accepted the proffered martini. He cradled it in long\nfingers and, elbows on knees, contemplated his hostess, analyzing her\nphysical attraction. He finally decided it emanated in the main from her\nalmond-shaped eyes and in their somewhat mystical synchronization with\nher wide, sensual lips. There was definitely a disconcerting\ncorrelation between them when she smiled, and as he was studying this\nphenomenon he realized that of course she _was_ smiling.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"It was rude of me to stare.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" she said. \"It was most complimentary. But I suppose in\nyour position it's best to be extremely careful.\"\n\n\"My position?\"\n\n\"Flirting with your patient's wife.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe put down the martini rather too quickly, sploshing a bit over the\nedges of the glass, leaving colorless stains that evaporated in a few\nmoments. \"I don't want you to think _that_, Mrs. Fairfield,\" he said.\n\"It's just that ... that ...\"\n\nBut she didn't interrupt him to say, \"Of course not,\" or \"I was just\nteasing,\" or \"Isn't it amazing how little rain we've had lately. Did you\nrealize that this is the driest November in sixteen and a half years?\"\nShe just stared and smiled at him, and let him flounder and make noises\nuntil he gave it up as a bad job and took a long drink from the frosted\nglass he had so recently and abruptly put down. She refilled his glass\nand leaned back in her chair.\n\n\"Could you tell me about him, Mrs. Fairfield?\" he said then. \"Start as\nfar back as you can, please.\"\n\n\"All right, Victor,\" she said. \"But it won't be much help, I'm afraid.\nDid he tell you he came from the future?\"\n\n\"He said that both of you did.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's right. Both of us. And I refuse to go back, is that it?\"\n\n\"Because of some deep-seated neurosis which he wants me to cure. His\nstory is plausible, logical, once you grant the basic premise that time\ntravel is an actuality. You see, Mrs. Fairfield--\"\n\n\"Mimi, please, Victor. After all, we're not in your office, and I'm not\nreally your patient, am I? Or am I?\"\n\n\"Of course not. Well, Mimi, then, the first step is to break down his\nstory. Show him for once and all that it is _not_ plausible, that it is\nnot even possible, that it is plainly and simply a lie which he himself\nhas made up to hide something that he is afraid of. Once we can get him\nto see this, or at least to wonder about it, once we can break the\ngranite assurance of his that he comes from another time, then perhaps\nwe can probe into his festering secret. But we can't do that, I'm\nafraid, until he begins to admit, at least to himself, that he _is_ sick\nand that he needs help. In this case it shouldn't be too hard.\"\n\n\"My, you _are_ brilliant. I wonder how you do it. Oh, you shouldn't gulp\na martini so quickly. Here, let me pour you some more, but sip it this\ntime. I know, I can't stand the taste either, but it's really the only\nway.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Fairfield--\"\n\n\"Mimi,\" she insisted.\n\n\"Mimi,\" he said, then hesitated.\n\n\"Mimi,\" she prompted.\n\n\"I forgot what I was going to say,\" he admitted. \"Cheers.\"\n\n\"Don't gulp,\" she said. \"Here, I'll pour you another one, but sip it,\nnow promise.\"\n\n\"God, it does taste awful, doesn't it?\" he said, grimacing. \"I don't\nthink I ever _tasted_ one before. Do you think limes might help?\"\n\n\"We have some in the kitchen, but it doesn't sound like a good idea to\nme. Why don't we just throw the mess away and whip up something else? I\njust wanted you to think I was chic this season to serve mar_tin_is.\"\n\n\"What season? Football?\"\n\n\"Hunting,\" she said, and the eyes and lips smiled together again.\n\n\"Mimi,\" Victor said a bit pompously, standing up and leaning over her,\n\"I hope you are not flirting with me. You are, remember, a married woman\nand are, in fact, married to a patient of mine.\"\n\n\"First of all,\" she said, \"you're being pompous. Second of all, he's not\nyour patient, he says I'm your patient. Third of all, I'm not married to\nhim. And fourth, of all ... is it fourth or fifth ... well anyway,\nfourth or fifth of all, let's try the limes. We've nothing to lose, it\ncouldn't taste worse.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"First of all,\" he said, following her to the kitchen, \"I am never\npompous. Second of all, he _is_ my patient because he came to my office\nobviously seeking psychiatric help but too sick to ask for it. I feel it\nonly my duty to help him and besides, his case is fascinating.\"\n\n\"And his wife isn't, I suppose,\" she said over her shoulder.\n\n\"Third of all,\" he said, \"and I ignore the interruption, what the hell\ndo you mean you're not married to him? And fourth of all, it is fourth,\nnot fifth, I think the limes will help immeasurably.\"\n\n\"Well, I think it all comes back to your original question. You know,\nabout telling you all about him, and how it started, and all that. You\nsee, I can't, because I don't remember. Here, you cut the limes while I\nlook for the squeezer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile Dr. Quink was cutting the limes he didn't exactly talk to himself,\nbut thoughts did present themselves to his mind with very nearly verbal\nexactitude. The immediate progression towards a solution of this case\ndid not seem to be so clearly cut out as he had assumed it would be.\nThere were, it now became more and more obvious, complications he had\nnot foreseen. Mrs. Fairfield was not exactly acting toward him as a\npsychiatrist normally expects the wife of a patient to, so that,\nalthough he found her pleasant and indeed invigorating, if that is the\nword and he was not sure that it was but the only alternative that came\nto his mind, stimulating, had connotations that he was not yet ready to\naccept, although he did find her pleasant and et cetera yet he found her\nbehavior also disturbing, in the clinical sense this time, and the\nrevelation as to her distinctly limited memory should be described not\nas a disturbance but as a downright earthquake, to ring in a\nseismological metaphor that occurred to him as he nicked his finger\nduring the slicing of the fourth lime.\n\n\"Oh, did you cut yourself?\" she said, straightening up from the lower\nshelves of a pine cupboard. \"I'm so sorry, but never mind. Here's the\nsqueezer.\"\n\nThe apparent non sequitur, coming in the midst of his thoughts that were\nalready confused, bewildered him for the moment, but he felt it would be\nmore fruitful to get back to the problem at hand and, blotting his\nseeping blood with a handkerchief, he inquired after her reticent\nmemory.\n\n\"Oh, let's mix in the lime juice first. Aren't you at all anxious to see\nhow it will taste? Honestly, men have no curiosity.\"\n\nWell, as it turned out, it tasted pretty good. At any rate, that was the\nconsensus of opinion, alcoholic as it might have been, as they returned\nwith the pitcher of green martinis to the living room. \"The furthest\nback that I can remember,\" Mimi said after they had settled themselves\non the divan, \"the absolutely first thing I can remember is relieving my\nbladder, if that makes any sense to you.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact,\" Victor said, \"it makes extremely good sense\nindeed. If you will pardon me and kindly direct me towards the wash\nroom?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he returned after an absence of a few minutes, during which time\nthe muted sound of snoring emanated from the master bedroom into the\nsilence left by his absence, he attempted once again to take up the\nthread of conversation that had been so abruptly snapped. \"You were\ntelling me, I believe, about the first thing you can remember.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Have another martini. Here, I'll pour. I was on a\ntrain, you see, at this moment when my memory begins. It was, by the\nway, eight months ago. As I emerged from the ladies' room I could not\nremember from which direction I had come. That is, I didn't know in\nwhich direction my seat was, if you follow me.\"\n\nVictor nodded more vigorously than he had intended, and she went on. \"I\ndidn't know whether to turn to right or left. That's a frightening\nfeeling to have in a train, not knowing where your seat is, when you're\nall closed in anyhow and you can feel the floor beneath your feet and\nthe walls and ceiling all rushing somewhere so terribly fast and\ncarrying you with it and all. I wasn't really _frightened_, you\nunderstand, but anyway, as I say, it's a terrible feeling. So I leaned\nback against the wall and tried to collect my wits. But I couldn't think\nof anything. That really frightened me. So I said to myself, now just\nrelax and think back to where you're going and when you got on the train\nand who you're with and everything like that and just relax and you'll\nremember where your seat is in half a moment. But I didn't. Remember, I\nmean. And suddenly I realized that I didn't remember where I was going\nor who I was with or when I had got on the train or anything, anything\nat all. I simply couldn't remember anything previous to a moment ago. I\nwas scared silly by this time, and that damned train kept on rumbling\nand shaking and rushing on into I didn't know what. So I said to myself,\nnow just relax and keep calm. This is all very silly. Now, then, I said\nafter taking two deep breaths and exhaling slowly, my name is ... my\nname is ... And by God, I didn't know my own name! It was such a queer\nfeeling I got goose pimples all over, just like that. I mean, I felt as\nif I knew my name, it was on the tip of my tongue, but I just couldn't\nsay it, I just couldn't remember my own name.\n\n\"Then I began to run. I didn't know where I was going but I was scared\nto hell and I just ran. I ran through five or six cars and the panic\nkept getting worse, and then I turned around and began running back the\nway I had come, just running as fast as I could and you know what that's\nlike on a train, I kept falling against people and pushing them off and\nrunning and suddenly this man grabbed me and said, 'Mimi, Mimi,' he kept\nsaying that and I guess some more and finally he calmed me down and, of\ncourse, it was Donald. He told me I was all right and to be quiet and\nwhat the hell was the matter with me anyhow. Well, to make a long story\nshort, we got off the train here and stayed in a hotel for a while and\nthen Donald bought this place and here we are. But I don't know if I'm\nreally his wife or not. Did he mention sex to you?\"\n\nVictor nodded and she said, \"So you know I'm not his wife _that_ way, at\nleast. And I have only his word that we were ever married.\"\n\n\"You don't have a marriage certificate, or pictures?\"\n\n\"We don't have anything that would prove our existence prior to that\ndate we were on the train. Naturally, he'd have left all that behind\nwhen we left wherever we were coming from. Any documents at all would\nruin his story. For all I know he just picked me up at the train\nstation.\"\n\n\"And you just picked up life here?\" Victor asked. \"As simple as that!\"\n\n\"What else could I do? I was terribly frightened, and Donald was so calm\nand assuring. I didn't really think I had lost my memory, you know. I\nmean, I _couldn't_ believe it. I didn't seem bewildered or anything, I\njust could not remember anything. Am I making sense? Anyway, I felt it\nwould all come back to me any moment, and I went on living from one\nmoment to another, and here I am and I still can't remember anything.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What was Donald's reaction when you told him you didn't know who you\nwere?\" Victor asked her.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, I didn't tell him right away. I was so afraid, I\njust went along with him.... Oh, it's so hard to explain.\"\n\n\"He didn't realize that you were acting strange, bewildered?\"\n\n\"Well, you know,\" Mimi said, \"we're not talking about a normal man,\nremember. I suppose if I acted sort of, you know, lost, he attributed it\nto our recent trip through time. _I_ don't know. Anyhow, he seemed to\naccept me.\"\n\n\"Let's get back to this time-travel bit. When did you realize that he\nthought you had both come from another time?\"\n\n\"The limes really make the drink, don't they?\" she asked. \"Well, it came\nout sort of gradually. I'd listen to him really closely whenever he\ntalked about the past, naturally. I was trying to find out about me\nwithout telling him, I thought he'd get all excited and all, and of\ncourse he did when I finally told him but by then it was all so\ndifferent and I'm afraid I've gotten confused. Where was I? Oh, you need\na refill.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Victor said, \"I forget myself exactly where it was you\nwere. Is that right? Where you was it were? No, I'm sure _that's_ wrong.\nWhere were you it was, I think. Does that sound better to you?\"\n\n\"Isn't that peculiar?\" she answered. \"Could it be where I was you\nweren't? No, now I'm being silly, and I can't for the life of me\nunderstand why. After all, this is a serious affair. Or at least I wish\nit were. Was.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I remember, damn it,\" she said. \"We were talking about _Don_ald again.\nWell, he kept making these remarks about coming through time and of\ncourse I didn't understand what the hell he was talking about but I\nthought because of my not remembering anything and all that I better\njust not say anything so I didn't, but he kept on and little by little I\ngot the idea, the general idea anyhow, but what on earth could I do\nabout it? And then he started talking about it was time to go back and\nall that, and I _cer_tainly wasn't going to go floating off in any old\n_time_ machine whether he was nuts or not, so I just kept putting\nhim off the best I could but he started getting so impatient that\nfinally--what was that? I think there's something wrong.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey both sat suddenly quite still and listened, but they heard nothing.\n\n\"I hear nothing,\" Victor said.\n\n\"That's it,\" Mimi hissed. \"He's not snoring anymore. He'll be here any\nminute. Act natural. Have another martini.\"\n\n\"Thank you, perhaps just one more,\" Victor said as Donald Fairfield came\ninto the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe strode across the room crossing in front of them without turning his\nhead or acknowledging their presence and made straight for the buffet in\nthe opposite corner. He bent over and extracted a thick black cigar,\nstruck a match, lit the cigar, puffed several times, dropped the match\ninto a gigantic ashtray made of marble, or something that looked like\nmarble, puffed several more times, finally inhaled deeply and exhaled\nslowly before he turned and nodded at his two spectators. \"You make\nbetter cigars than we do, I'll say that for the twentieth century,\" he\ncomplimented Victor in the manner of all tourists, as if Victor himself\nwere the cause and not the product of his age. \"One of the mysteries of\nhistory,\" he continued, \"how a simple technique, like making a good\ncigar or a good mummy, can be lost once it's been perfected. Always\nseems to be though. Each age has its secrets. You can't make wine now\nlike the ancient Greeks did.\"\n\n\"As,\" Mimi interpolated. \"As the Greeks did.\"\n\n\"I hate to be bombastic,\" Donald answered her, \"not to say dogmatic or\npedagogical, or impecunious too, for that matter, at least in this\nparticular day and age, but I believe my original adjectival usage to be\nthe correct one.\"\n\n\"If your thought had called for an adjective,\" Mimi countered, \"but\nproperly, according to the accepted grammar of the present day, that is,\nyou should have used an adverb.\"\n\n\"Whatchamacallit tastes good _like_ a dum-dum cigarette should,\" Victor\nput in, in an attempt to settle the subject.\n\n\"That's ridiculous,\" Donald answered, \"it's completely wrong.\"\n\n\"I _know_ it's wrong,\" Victor cried, \"that's the point, _every_body\nknows it's--\"\n\n\"Of course it is,\" Mimi agreed. \"Why on earth _should_ a cigarette taste\ngood? Who says it should? If one wants to taste something good, why then\none takes a bite of cake, or a smidgin of candy, or a plate of cold\nborscht. If one cares for borscht. But you certainly don't smoke a\ncigarette to taste something good, they all taste horrible. Horribly? Oh\ndamn, look what you started, Donald. Now I can't think straight.\nAnyhow, people smoke because of the phallic symbolism, right, Victor?\"\n\nDonald looked with distaste from Mimi to the big black cigar he was\nholding in his right hand, and thence to Victor for a denial. Victor,\nhowever, shrugged his shoulders, and murmured something to the effect\nthat this consideration might possibly have some bearing on the subject,\nthat it was really a matter of interest more to the applied\npsychologists and advertising men than to the pure scientist or doctor,\nand that even so it didn't necessarily follow that--\n\n\"You're hedging,\" Mimi said. \"All you have to do is watch a woman smoke\nand then watch a man and--\"\n\n\"I thought we were talking about wine,\" Donald interrupted, crushing out\nhis cigar in the oversize marble, or nearly so, ashtray. \"What were we\nsaying about it?\"\n\n\"You were commenting on the relative excellence of our wines and those\nof the Greeks,\" Victor told him. \"I was wondering if perhaps you've\nvisited them too?\"\n\nDonald Fairfield did not answer the query. He stared at Victor\ncontemplatively, drew in a deep lungful of acrid smoke-filled air from\nabove the smoldering ashtray, and let it out again. \"This is not going\nto be as simple an affair as it should be,\" he said finally. \"I can see\nthat now, but I suppose there's nothing to be done but to see it\nthrough. I take it you've settled everything between the two of you\nwhile I've been gone?\"\n\n\"Oh my,\" Mimi ejaculated, \"I've got to see about dinner. See if you two\ncan find something to talk about while I'm gone.\" She hurried out of the\nroom, one hand already reaching for the apron of the modernistic design\nas she passed through the swinging door into the kitchen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well,\" Donald began, \"what did you discover from my little wife?\"\n\n\"To begin with,\" Victor answered him, \"she seems to have lost her\nmemory. Everything previous to an experience on the train some eight\nmonths ago is a total blank. Were you aware of this?\"\n\n\"I was not only aware of it, I told you about it,\" Donald answered.\n\"What in God's creation is this moldy brew?\" he asked after taking a\ndeep gulp from the lip of the pitcher and spitting most of it into the\nfirst ashtray he could reach.\n\n\"Lime martinis, like a daiquiri, only dryer. If you don't care for them\nyou might refill my glass. That's right, you did tell me she didn't\nremember, but of course--\"\n\n\"You didn't believe me,\" Donald finished for him. \"Naturally. Look, Dr.\nQuink, I think I'm a reasonable man. Damn it, I _know_ I am. I don't\nexpect you to believe me right off the rat when I walk in and tell\nyou--\"\n\n\"Bat,\" Victor interrupted.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" Donald countered.\n\n\"Bat. Right off the. Not rat, right off the bat. It's a colloquialism,\ncomes from baseball, that's a sport we play. Perhaps you haven't come\nacross it, if you've only been here some eight months?\"\n\n\"Yes, just about eight months. I've heard of the sport, of course, but\nhaven't gone to see a game yet. Do you think it's worth my while?\"\n\n\"Probably not. Strictly a partisan sport.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see your point. Not an idiom, you wouldn't say?\"\n\n\"No, definitely not,\" Victor said. \"Takes time to make an idiom, but\nonly God can make a tree. O Lord, I better have another martini. Would\nyou pour, I think I might miss. Still, a colloquialism, not a doubt\nabout it. The expression hasn't lasted to your day, I take it? If it\nhad, then it might be an idiom. Might, I say, only might. I promise\nnothing.\"\n\n\"And quite right you are,\" Donald said. \"Still, I want you to understand\nthat I don't expect you to believe me right off the bat when I wander\ninto your busy little office and tell you--by the way, what is your\nreceptionist doing always staring at the floor right next to her desk?\"\n\n\"She's in love. He's an advertising man.\"\n\n\"Oh, well yes, of course. When I tell you I come from the future.\nObviously you're not going to accept that right off the rat, as I say. I\nmean, no one could expect you to. However, after talking at length to me\nin your office and then holding a private conversation with my wife, you\nshould, I think, as a trained and highly competent psychiatrist,\ncertainly the foremost of your day--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt this point Victor had waved a deprecating hand.\n\n\"Please allow me to say that I am certainly a better judge of your\nposition in this world than you could possibly be. Seeing it in the\nproper perspective, I mean. I did not intend to compliment you when I\ndescribed you as I just did, I merely state a fact already known to my\nconfreres. Then you should, as I say, under these most favorable\ncircumstances, and certainly being forewarned, then you should be able\nto tell who is suffering from a delusion and who is not. Apart from what\nthe delusion is, and whether or not you choose to believe in it, simply\nstudying the behavior of the people involved, you should be able to tell\nwho is acting normally and who is not.\"\n\n\"I agree with you in every particular,\" Victor said. \"I certainly\nshould. And I think I can, and have. In point of fact--\"\n\n\"Dinner is ready,\" Mimi said. \"And no shop talk, please. I want you to\ntaste my squash and applesauce piece. And no one, absolutely _no_ one,\ncomes into my dining room with a stinking black cigar.\"\n\n\"Could it be Galilililu?\" Donald murmured. \"Damn.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"This is excellent,\" Victor said. \"How do you make it?\"\n\n\"Why, thank you,\" Mimi replied. \"It's very simple. You just take the\nsquash and then pour in the applesauce and cinnamon.\"\n\n\"There must be more to it than that,\" Victor insisted, smiling around a\nmouthful.\n\n\"Of course there is,\" she said. \"But I'm not telling you all my secrets.\nYou'll have to come back if you want it again.\"\n\n\"Damn it,\" said Donald, \"stop jibber-jabbering! We know why we're here,\nso let's talk about it. Can you cure my crazy wife?\"\n\n\"Donald!\" Mimi spluttered.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Fairfield,\" Victor said, \"let's not be unfair. Your wife has\namnesia, but she's not crazy. As a matter of fact, psychiatrists no\nlonger recognize the term as such--\"\n\n\"Pass the roast,\" Donald said. \"Do you think _I'm_ crazy or don't you?\"\n\n\"I most certainly do not!\"\n\n\"Do you think I was born in the future?\"\n\n\"Mr. Fairfield, talking like this isn't getting us anywhere. Now\nMimi--I'm sorry, Mrs. Fairfield--doesn't remember anything previous to\nthat train ride we were talking about....\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" Donald said. \"That's when we got here. We'll skip the\ntechnicalities, but it's always easier to land on something that's\nmoving. Standard procedure. I don't really understand it myself, but I'm\nno engineer. We landed in the twentieth century--is it the twentieth or\nthe twenty-first?\"\n\n\"The twentieth,\" Victor assured him.\n\n\"Isn't that silly of me. I'm always getting mixed up. It doesn't make\nmuch difference, though, you know. Not much of a change from one to the\nother. Not like the nineteenth and twentieth, nothing like that at all.\nDo you ever find yourself wondering if it's the twentieth of the month\nor the twenty-first?\"\n\n\"I have a calendar on my desk.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Donald mused. \"I didn't notice it.\" He stared intently at Victor\nQuink while he munched his celery. \"It's not hard to see why you've\nrisen to the top of your profession. Calendar on your desk, eh?\" He\nlooked at his wife and tapped the side of his head significantly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You landed aboard this train some eight months ago,\" Dr. Quink\nprompted. \"What are you doing here, anyhow? Are you an historian?\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" he replied at once. \"Haven't you noticed all the books you\npeople are writing? Every one of your presidents, every general, every\nfield-marshal, every scientist, manufacturer, tennis star, and juvenile\ndelinquent has written a book, or at least a serial for the _Post_. No\nreason at all for any historian to come back to this particular age. No\nother age in all history, I might add, has been so fond of itself or so\ncognizant of the need for preserving itself and its records for\nposterity as has yours. And with very little reason. But of course that\nlast is only a personal observation, and I may be prejudiced, having\nlived here, so to speak, for these past months. You get to see the seamy\nside of a civilization, you know, when you live there yourself.\nIncidentally, would you be interested to know how your age has been\nclassified by posterity? Of course you would, silly of me to ask. Well,\nto get on with it, you know how historians are always _naming_ periods,\nand groups, and whatever. The Age of Darkness, you remember, then the\nAge of Awakening, the Age of Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, et\ncetera? As it turns out, you've come down to us as the Age of Verbiage.\nAmusing, eh? No? Well, you can't please everybody. I thought it was\ncute. But in answer to your question I'll have to say no, I'm just a\ntourist. I'm on vacation. Nothing more sensational than that, I'm\nafraid.\"\n\n\"And naturally you took your wife with you,\" Victor added.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDonald looked down at his plate for just a moment or two, then answered\n\"naturally,\" without raising his eyes at all.\n\n\"Somehow, Mr. Fairfield,\" Victor said, \"somehow I get the feeling you're\nholding out on me, you're not telling me all.\"\n\n\"Damn it, the more I tell you the less you believe. I never should have\ntold you the truth at all. I should have just said my wife's suffering\nfrom amnesia and let it go at that.\"\n\n\"I'm not an engineer either,\" Victor answered. \"I can't just twist a\nscrew and restore the proper functioning of the memory mechanism. I've\ngot to know the whole truth, Mr. Fairfield, the whole truth.\"\n\n\"How come my wife is Mimi and I'm Mr. Fairfield?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Victor stammered, \"I--\"\n\n\"Donald, you're embarrassing him,\" Mimi interrupted.\n\n\"Just joshing, pulling your toe, or leg, or some such,\" Donald assured\nhim. \"We might as well be friends, at least. Make it Donald too. I might\neven take your autograph back with me. I think the fights are on\ntelevision. Want to watch?\"\n\n\"I'll just do up the dishes, dear,\" Mimi said.\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't care much for the prize fights,\" Victor said.\n\n\"Just sit where you are then, and relax. I'm going to watch them. Won't\nsee many more of them before we go,\" he said, throwing a lowering glance\nat his wife as he left the room. He returned in a few moments, however,\nbefore the two of them had had time to begin a conversation, and\naddressed Victor, \"Sorry to interfere, promise I won't interrupt again.\nI'm sure you two are making just miles of progress and I dislike the\nrole of an impedance, but a phrase just popped into my head and I'm sure\nI won't be able to concentrate on the fights properly until it's\nresolved. I wonder, Dr. Quink, if you could possibly tell me if this is\nthe age that is so fond of saying that idiots walk with God? You know\nwhat I mean, that they don't need their wit because God's hand is on\ntheir shoulder, so to speak, and that's why et cetera? Childish,\nperhaps, but touching, don't you think?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Mr. Fairfield,\" Victor replied, \"but I hadn't heard the\nphrase before. Perhaps I'm just unfamiliar with it, or more probably you\npicked it up elsewhere on your travels.\"\n\n\"Mmmm,\" Donald answered, somewhat noncommittally, \"perhaps. Well, don't\nlet me detain you. I'll just run along. Vaya con Dios,\" he waved as he\nleft the room. They waited a few seconds in silence, but he didn't\nreturn.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Will you take him on as a patient?\" Mimi asked when they heard the\nfirst roaring of the crowd from the living-room.\n\n\"I'd like to very much, if you want me to. He's a fascinating case. But\nit won't be easy, it's going to take time.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" she assured him. \"He's not dangerous, and we've\nplenty of money. Take all the time you want.\"\n\n\"You know,\" he said, \"I don't mind admitting I'm pretty bewildered by\nnow.\" He shook his head two or three times, as if to clear it, then\nasked, \"Where does the money come from?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"I mean, what does he do for a living?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Did you ask him?\"\n\n\"Not yet. He'll probably say he brought the money from the future.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" she agreed.\n\n\"Well, don't you even know where your husband gets his money?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What a combination you two are,\" he muttered.\n\n\"I can't hear you,\" she called from the kitchen. \"The water is making\ntoo much noise. Come in here.\" He went in and leaned against the powder\nblue refrigerator while she soaked the dishes. \"He won't come to your\noffice for examinations or treatments,\" she said. \"He thinks I'm the one\nwho's nuts.\"\n\n\"That's probably true,\" he agreed, somewhat ambiguously. \"It would be\nbetter if you were my patient at the same time. You do have this amnesia\nanyhow, I'd like to clear that up. Would you be willing?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'd love it,\" she cried. \"I can come see you for regular\ntreatments, and then you can come to the house for supper several times\na week and see him then.\"\n\n\"Let's go see if he agrees to that,\" Victor said. Mimi dried her hands\nin a hurry on a dish towel, grabbed a handful of his fingers, and pulled\nhim after her to the living-room. Her fingers were still cool and damp.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe saw a lot of the two of them in the few weeks following that night,\nbut he learned nothing more. Donald Fairfield was sulky and\nuncommunicative, muttering only over and over again that he had already\nsaid too much and Lord knew what would become of him when he got back\nbut he didn't see what else he could have done under the circumstances\nand no one else had ever gotten into such a fix why the hell did it have\nto happen to him, a quiet and thoughtful and considerate man who\nwouldn't swat a fly, or anyhow not a pregnant fly. This opened up an\nentire new line of discussion. Mimi didn't know, in reply to his query,\nwhether flies got pregnant or not. At least, she had never seen one.\nDonald was forced into a short lecture, barely remembered from second\nyear biology, but it seemed to satisfy them. \"We don't have lower forms\nof life at home, you know,\" Donald apologized.\n\nOn days when he didn't come to their home for supper, Mimi would have\nthe last appointment of the day with him, and after her hour they would\nleave together, waking up Margaret before they left the office, stop off\nfor cocktails before Mimi had to catch her train, miss the train, have\ndinner, miss the next train, catch a show or walk in the park, drive\nMimi home, and finally part. They talked a lot, they talked seemingly\nwithout reserve, but Victor learned nothing new. Her life before that\ntrain ride was simply a blank.\n\n\"I'd like to try hypnotism,\" Victor said to her one day in his office.\n\n\"No,\" she replied.\n\nHe was surprised. \"I don't think you understand,\" he said. \"I want to\nhypnotize you and try to take you back before that train ride, back to\nyour childhood--\"\n\n\"No,\" she said.\n\n\"It's perfectly safe,\" he said.\n\nShe filed a rough edge off her nail, second finger, right hand.\n\n\"It's standard analytic procedure. I've used it dozens of times. I'm\nquite competent--\"\n\n\"No,\" she said.\n\n\"But why not?\" he asked.\n\n\"You'll find out all about me,\" she said. \"I'll have no secrets left.\"\n\n\"But you shouldn't want to have any secrets from your psychoanalyst. I\ncan't help you then.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she agreed. \"But I want to have secrets from you,\" she said\nsoftly, and looked up quietly from her fingers, staring directly into\nhis eyes, and her lips and her eyes underwent that mysterious\nsynchronization once again. \"I don't want you to know me like a book,\nwith everything spelled out in black and white, but like a portrait,\nwith hidden shades and nuances.... I want you to know me gradually,\nslowly....\"\n\n\"Mimi,\" he said, and paused. He pushed back from his desk, swiveled\ncompletely around and back to his original position, cracked two\nknuckles, tried to force some saliva into a suddenly dry mouth, and\nstarted to speak again. \"Mimi, it's not unusual for a patient to develop\na feeling of affection for her psychoanalyst. In fact, it's the usual--\"\n\n\"It's not like that with us, though, is it?\" she asked, more quietly,\nmore softly and deeply, than before.\n\nAfter a long pause he said, \"No. No, it's not.\"\n\nAnd so they sat there while the daylight faded outside them and the\ntwilight crawled up sixty-three floors to encircle their window and\ncontinue unhesitatingly upward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What are we going to do?\" she asked.\n\n\"We're not going to do anything, Mimi,\" he finally said. \"When I'm with\nyou, it's all so light and fantastic and funny, that I forget. But it\nwould be unforgivable to fall in love with a patient, and the wife of a\npatient. I can't do it. We'll have to stop right away. I'm no good as an\nanalyst to you anymore, anyway. I'm sorry, I'll send you to someone\nelse. And now you'd better go.\"\n\nShe stood up, walked around his desk, and put her hands lightly on his\nneck. \"You're such a dear,\" she said. \"I'll always love you. I've never\nseen you so serious before. We always laugh and talk and giggle when\nwe're together, and I loved you then. But now that you're sad and\nserious and oh so pitiably tragic I love you more than I could ever tell\nyou. But please don't worry, don't worry about a thing, darling. You'll\nsee, it will all work out.\"\n\n\"It can't work out, Mimi, there's absolutely no way on earth for it to\nwork out. There's no solution at all.\"\n\n\"Please don't worry, darling,\" she said, picking up her gloves. \"I can't\nbear to see you looking so tragic. Life isn't so serious, especially as\nyou're loved.\" She walked out and closed the door behind her. Victor sat\nquite still. He could barely hear her saying \"Margaret, wake up,\nMargaret, it's time to go home,\" through the thick wooden door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe phone rang in his office three days later. He was alone at the time,\ngoing over some notes he had just taken with another patient. Margaret\nwas out, presumably peering through the floor of the ladies' lounge down\nthe hall, and he picked up the receiver himself.\n\n\"Victor, come quick,\" Mimi screamed through the wires. \"He's trying to\nkill me!\"\n\nShe said more, but he heard none of it. His fingers went numb, the phone\ndropped, he was out of his seat and skidding around the desk before it\nhit the carpeted floor. He had to wait at the elevator. He thought for\none silly moment of racing to the exit and running down sixty-three\nfloors, then compromised on stamping his feet and slamming one fist into\nthe other palm and striding up and down while three other men and two\nwomen also waiting for the elevator stared at him. He thought of calling\nthe police just as the elevator door opened, and he nearly turned and\nleft it, but couldn't and leaped in just as the doors were closing. \"I'm\nDr. Quink,\" he shouted at the elevator operator. \"This is an emergency.\nTake me straight down.\"\n\nThe elevator went straight down. The doors opened on the ground floor\nand Victor shot out, leaving behind two nearly mortally sick women and\nseveral acid comments to the effect that he was probably late for a\nmatinee. \"I couldn't take any chances,\" apologized the elevator\noperator, \"it might really have _been_ an emergency.\"\n\nIt wasn't raining in New York that day, so he was able to get a cab\nimmediately. He took it to his parking lot and roared off from there. He\nsped through the city traffic, incurring the widespread wrath and\ndisapproval of the police department. A patrol car caught up with him on\nGrand Central Parkway and forced him off the road. He explained who he\nwas and that a madman was threatening to kill his wife, no, not _his_\nwife, the madman's wife, and that he didn't have time to sit here and\ntalk about it. The police officer told him to follow him, and, siren\nblazing, they roared off once again.\n\nIt occurred to both of them nearly simultaneously that Victor couldn't\npossibly follow the police officer, it had to be the other way around,\nand so Victor took the lead, the red siren hanging on behind. But when\nVictor left the parkway he saw in his mirror no flashing red light,\nsomewhere he had lost the police. He touched the brake a second, for the\nfirst time in the past fifteen minutes, then accelerated again and\nhurried on. He had not the time to wait.\n\nThe door to the Fairfield's home was unlocked and he burst in without\nringing. \"Mimi,\" he cried, then, hearing vague noises from the upstairs\nbedroom, he hurried there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe didn't find Mimi there. Donald Fairfield was alone in the bedroom,\nand the bedroom was a mess, and there was a gun in Donald Fairfield's\nhand.\n\nVictor stopped in the doorway, a gas pain shooting up his side. He\nthought at that moment, inanely, he should play more handball.\n\n\"Galileo,\" Donald Fairfield said, \"it came to me just a few moments ago.\nGalileo. It was on the tip of my tongue all the time, I just couldn't\nthink of it. What were we saying about him, do you remember? What\nbrought it up?\"\n\nVictor braced himself up against the doorway, breathing hard. He stared\nat the gun in Donald's hand. Donald followed his gaze down his side to\nthe gun, and seemed surprised when he saw it. \"Oh, yes. She's in the\nbathroom,\" he said, waving his gun towards the closed door. \"She's\nlocked the door.\"\n\nVictor belched.\n\n\"For God's sake,\" said Donald. \"There's a time and a place for\neverything.\"\n\nVictor crossed to the door. \"Mimi,\" he called. \"Mimi, it's me, Victor.\"\n\nThe lock clicked, the door opened, and Mimi walked out and folded\nherself into his arms. He held her until she stopped shaking, then until\nhe himself stopped shaking and until his breath came more easily. He\nkept all the while his back toward Donald and the gun, and his arms\nfolded around her so that she was safe from him. Then he turned and\ncalmly as he could, he asked what in the holy hell was going on.\n\n\"He wants me to go back with him, right now,\" Mimi said. She was\nshivering in his arms. \"I'm not going, I'm not going with him.\"\n\n\"Of course, you're not,\" Victor said. He turned back to Donald. \"What's\nthe rush all of a sudden?\" he asked. \"What's the big emergency?\" he\nsmiled.\n\n\"Don't turn on the personality, Dr. Quink,\" Fairfield said. \"It's too\ncomplicated to explain, but time's run out on us. We've got to go\ntonight, and I'm taking her with me dead or alive, I don't give a damn\nwhich way anymore, she's coming with me dead or alive.\"\n\nVictor let go of Mimi and took a step toward him, but the hand with the\ngun came up and gun was pointed straight at him, and the voice was flat\nand tired and desperate, \"I can't leave her here, you can see what it\nwould mean. They're very strict about time traveling, they have to be,\nand she can't stay here. She hasn't lost her memory, she knows damned\nwell where she comes from, and she's going back now, one way or the\nother. I don't know what'll happen to me when we get back if I kill her,\nbut it's my decision and I can't let her stay behind, no matter what.\"\nHis voice started to rise and the words began to come faster. He was\nworking himself up dangerously near the breaking point.\n\n\"If you'll just calm down for a few moments,\" Victor tried, \"I'm sure we\ncan talk this out sensibly enough.\"\n\n\"It won't work, Dr. Quink, it won't work. You're trying to talk it out\nlike I'm nuts, you're trying to reassure me, but it won't work because\nyou can't. Because I'm _not_ nuts! I'm telling the truth and she knows\nit! Damn you, Mimi, tell him!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"All right! All right, I'll tell him,\" she cried. \"And I'll tell you,\ntoo. And I'm not going back with you, you'll see. Because I planned this\nfrom the start. My God, what a day,\" she sighed, and sat down on the\nbed. \"Now listen, both of you, you, too, Donald, because you don't know\nit all either.\"\n\n\"He's not crazy, Victor, we do come from the future. I was reading about\nall the Nobel prize winners, darling, and of course, I came across you,\nand right from the beginning you fascinated me. Do you know you were the\nfirst psychiatrist ever to win the award, and then you won it twice?\nOh, I can tell you, I was terribly impressed! And when I saw your\npicture, you know the one, the portrait by Videl in the Museum of\nAncient--oh, but of course, it hasn't been done yet. You have gray\nsideburns then, and there's not a touch of gray in your hair now.\nAnyway, you look absolutely distinguished with gray, it's certainly your\ncolor. And I thought you were just the handsomest Nobel winner I had\never seen, and darling, you are, not the slightest doubt about it. Don't\nyou think so, Donald?\"\n\n\"He's charming,\" Donald replied. \"Just terribly, terribly charming.\nWould you mind getting on with it?\"\n\n\"Please,\" Victor started to interrupt.\n\n\"Don't be modest, darling,\" Mimi went on. \"So then I read a biography,\nand then another, and soon I was doing nothing but studying you. I fell\nin love with you, dear, I fell in love with you a thousand years after\nyou were dead. You never married, you know, and you needed me, and I\nguess that helped, but at any rate I fell, and I fell all the way.\n\n\"We're not married, Donald and I. There's no sex then, so there's no\nneed for marriage. Right, Donald? Right. But he was coming here on\nvacation and he was nice enough to take me along, and we had to fit in,\nso we came as husband and wife. Just a matter of convenience, really.\nBut then we were here for all those months, and I didn't get to meet\nyou, and something about this age just got into my bones, I loved it so,\npeople really _live_ now, not like back home. And I nearly forgot about\nyou, Victor dear, although I can't understand that now, and all I wanted\nwas to live here like a normal person, a normal wife. But _he_ couldn't\nunderstand that. At any rate, I went native, I went whole hog native.\n\n\"And then it was time to go home. But I wasn't going. So I made up this\nstory about forgetting everything and I pretended I thought he was nuts\nor something and he went and got you and suddenly there you were in my\nliving room and it all came back, darling, it came back so fast and\nstrong I thought I'd die on the spot. And I love you now, darling, I\nlove you now and forever, and I won't go back alive, I swear that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Mimi,\" Donald begged, \"think of the future. If you don't go back it'll\nbe all upset. We can't have people just popping up in the past from the\nfuture, there has to be discipline. It's one thing to come here quietly\nfor a few months of harmless vacation, and then just as quietly to\ndisappear. But to settle down brazenly in another time, to ... to\nimmigrate, as it were, well, it just can't be done. There's no\nprecedent, just none at all. _No_body would think of doing such a thing.\nWhy, who knows what would happen if you stayed here? It could upset the\nwhole pattern of the future!\"\n\n\"The future will just have to take care of itself,\" Mimi answered. \"I\nlove him, and you can't argue with that. There's nothing you can say\nthat can argue with that. I don't care poof for the future.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVictor sat down quietly on the edge of the bed, he felt a bit weak\naround the general vicinity of the knees. Mimi stood up and strode over\nto the window, her back to the conversation. \"Mimi,\" Donald pleaded,\n\"just think of what you're doing. You'll lose your immortality, for one\nthing. You know, it's not something you're just _born_ with, it's the\nresult of careful medical science. Why, almost _any_thing could happen\nto you here. They have all _sorts_ of ugly diseases. And if you should\nlast just a few years longer, just maybe fifty or sixty more years, your\nheart will almost certainly pop off. They don't have any sort of\narterial rejuvenation now, nothing at all. You're trading immortality\nfor a mere _moment_.\"\n\n\"I don't give a damn or a wild pig's snort,\" she replied.\n\n\"Don't be vulgar,\" Donald said. \"Let's keep this on a civilized plane.\"\n\n\"That's not vulgarity,\" she answered. \"It's poetry. 'I don't give a damn\nor a wild pig's snort, but you cut just one strand and the fashions be\ndamned, I swear that I'll boil three in lime!'\"\n\n\"Lime?\" Victor asked rather weakly.\n\n\"I think so, dear,\" Mimi said. \"Would you care for a martini?\"\n\n\"How about the toilet!\" Donald suddenly thundered. \"How about _that_,\nhey?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" Mimi replied.\n\n\"The toilets, the toilets,\" he repeated impatiently. \"Do you want to\nspend the rest of your short life with this old-fashioned plumbing?\" He\nwaved wildly toward the tile bathroom. \"It's all right roughing it for a\nfew months like we did, but can you honestly imagine spending the rest\nof your _life_ under such vile conditions? Ha, you didn't think of that,\ndid you?\" he continued when he saw the sudden stricken expression on her\nface. \"You don't like the idea, do you?\"\n\nMimi clenched her fists at her side and stamped her little foot. \"I\ndon't _care_,\" she spit out, \"I absolutely do not care! I will stay with\nhim, I will, I will, I _will_.\" She turned and looked at the bathroom\nthat opened off the bedroom, and blanched for one moment, then she shut\nher eyes, gave another kick, and insisted. \"I will, I will, I will!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDonald sighed and slapped his hands at his side. He turned around,\nhesitated for a few seconds, then said to the wall, \"I've tried. I've\ntried everything I could think of.\" He turned again and faced them, and\nhe raised his gun. \"You're coming, Mimi. One way or another, you're\ncoming.\"\n\nSo quietly he hardly realized what he was doing, but thankful that the\ngas pain had vanished, Victor stepped between the gun and the girl.\n\"You'll have to kill me, Donald,\" he said. \"You won't take her out of\nhere without killing me, I promise you that, and what will that do to\nyour future? A man from the future killing somebody here? Oh, no,\nthat'll upset everything. And before I've become famous? Your whole\nhistory will be changed. You'd better think twice, Donald.\"\n\nThe gun wavered, and lowered.\n\n\"Would you care for a martini, Donald, dear?\" Mimi asked.\n\nDonald turned and ran from the room. They heard his feet slipping down\nthe stairs, they heard the front door slam behind him.\n\nVictor started after him, but Mimi held him back. \"What are you going to\ndo,\" she cried, \"chase after him? What will you do when you catch him?\nYou're needed more here. After all,\" she continued, \"think what I just\nwent through? I'm a nervous wreck, almost getting carted off to God\nknows where like that. I need the care of a competent physician.\"\n\nHe turned back to her in a daze, she clucked and patted his cheek, and\npushed him down onto the bed. She pulled out his handkerchief and mopped\nhis face. \"Aren't you proud of me?\" she said. \"Wasn't that fast\nthinking? How did you like that little story I told? It really threw\nhim, didn't it? He didn't know _what_ to think.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" Victor stammered, \"you mean you didn't mean it, you just\nmade it up? Just like that?\"\n\n\"Darling,\" she began to giggle, \"you didn't bel_ieve_ that wild story?\nAbout the future? Oh, _darling_, you couldn't possibly believe it.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" he said. \"Of course not. Quick thinking, Mimi, yes,\nvery quick thinking. It _was_ a convincing story, you know. Very good.\nBut, my God! I've got to catch him.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" she said, pushing him down. \"You'll never find him,\nyou'll never see him again. He'll be lost in the crowd. One more\nscrewball in New York, they'll never notice him. He'll fit right in. He\nmay even become President some day, or at least Dean of Students at some\nsmall New England College. You just take my word for it, darling, and\nrelax a moment. I'll rush downstairs and bring you up a martini. We\ndeserve one. He'll be all right now. As long as he's made up his mind\nthat he can leave me here, he'll trot off somewhere and dig up another\nneurosis, or psychosis, or whatever. He's not dangerous anymore. And you\nheard him say we were never married, and we have no marriage\ncertificate, so I guess we're not. Can't we just forget about him, just\nas if he never existed? Maybe he never _did_ exist. Maybe he was just a\nfigment of our imagination. Maybe he was just an instrument of kismet to\nbring us together. Maybe he was just a wandering minstrel, or a memory\nlooking for a chance to be real?\"\n\n\"Maybe you'd better not talk so much, but just bring up the martini.\nBetter bring a pitcher. Green ones.\"\n\nAnd so she did. Their first honeymoon they spent in Bermuda; they took\ntheir second on a trip to Sweden ten years later, when Victor went to\naccept his first Nobel prize.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Science Fiction Stories_ April\n    1960.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
