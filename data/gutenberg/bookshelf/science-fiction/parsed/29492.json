Something about his lanky,\nintense appearance suggested his occupation: certified public\naccountant.\n\nHe stopped behind his wife, who was studying a newspaper classified\npage, and frowned. \"They said to wait here. They'll come get us. Said\nthe place is hard to find at night.\"\n\nMartha Graham looked up from the newspaper. She was a doll-faced woman,\nheavily pregnant, a kind of pink prettiness about her. The yellow glow\nfrom the light above the booth subdued the red-auburn cast of her\nponytail hair.\n\n\"I just _have_ to be in a house when the baby's born,\" she said. \"What'd\nthey sound like?\"\n\n\"I dunno. There was a funny kind of interruption--like an argument in\nsome foreign language.\"\n\n\"Did they sound foreign?\"\n\n\"In a way.\" He motioned along the night-shrouded line of trailers toward\none with two windows glowing amber. \"Let's wait inside. These bugs out\nhere are fierce.\"\n\n\"Did you tell them which trailer is ours?\"\n\n\"Yes. They didn't sound at all anxious to look at it. That's odd--them\nwanting to trade their house for a trailer.\"\n\n\"There's nothing odd about it. They've probably just got itchy feet like\nwe did.\"\n\nHe appeared not to hear her. \"Funniest-sounding language you ever heard\nwhen that argument started--like a squirt of noise.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInside the trailer, Ted Graham sat down on the green couch that opened\ninto a double bed for company.\n\n\"They could use a good tax accountant around here,\" he said. \"When I\nfirst saw the place, I got that definite feeling. The valley looks\nprosperous. It's a wonder nobody's opened an office here before.\"\n\nHis wife took a straight chair by the counter separating kitchen and\nliving area, folded her hands across her heavy stomach.\n\n\"I'm just continental tired of wheels going around under me,\" she said.\n\"I want to sit and stare at the same view for the rest of my life. I\ndon't know how a trailer ever seemed glamorous when--\"\n\n\"It was the inheritance gave us itchy feet,\" he said.\n\nTires gritted on gravel outside.\n\nMartha Graham straightened. \"Could that be them?\"\n\n\"Awful quick, if it is.\" He went to the door, opened it, stared down at\nthe man who was just raising a hand to knock.\n\n\"Are you Mr. Graham?\" asked the man.\n\n\"Yes.\" He found himself staring at the caller.\n\n\"I'm Clint Rush. You called about the house?\" The man moved farther into\nthe light. At first, he'd appeared an old man, fine wrinkle lines in his\nface, a tired leather look to his skin. But as he moved his head in the\nlight, the wrinkles seemed to dissolve--and with them, the years lifted\nfrom him.\n\n\"Yes, we called,\" said Ted Graham. He stood aside. \"Do you want to look\nat the trailer now?\"\n\nMartha Graham crossed to stand beside her husband. \"We've kept it in\nawfully good shape,\" she said. \"We've never let anything get seriously\nwrong with it.\"\n\n_She sounds too anxious_, thought Ted Graham. _I wish she'd let me do\nthe talking for the two of us._\n\n\"We can come back and look at your trailer tomorrow in daylight,\" said\nRush. \"My car's right out here, if you'd like to see our house.\"\n\nTed Graham hesitated. He felt a nagging worry tug at his mind, tried to\nfix his attention on what bothered him.\n\n\"Hadn't we better take our car?\" he asked. \"We could follow you.\"\n\n\"No need,\" said Rush. \"We're coming back into town tonight anyway. We\ncan drop you off then.\"\n\nTed Graham nodded. \"Be right with you as soon as I lock up.\"\n\nInside the car, Rush mumbled introductions. His wife was a dark shadow\nin the front seat, her hair drawn back in a severe bun. Her features\nsuggested gypsy blood. He called her Raimee.\n\n_Odd name_, thought Ted Graham. And he noticed that she, too, gave that\nstrange first impression of age that melted in a shift of light.\n\nMrs. Rush turned her gypsy features toward Martha Graham. \"You are going\nto have a baby?\"\n\nIt came out as an odd, veiled statement.\n\nAbruptly, the car rolled forward.\n\nMartha Graham said, \"It's supposed to be born in about two months. We\nhope it's a boy.\"\n\nMrs. Rush looked at her husband. \"I have changed my mind,\" she said.\n\nRush spoke without taking his attention from the road. \"It is too ...\"\nHe broke off, spoke in a tumble of strange sounds.\n\nTed Graham recognized it as the language he'd heard on the telephone.\n\nMrs. Rush answered in the same tongue, anger showing in the intensity of\nher voice. Her husband replied, his voice calmer.\n\nPresently, Mrs. Rush fell moodily silent.\n\nRush tipped his head toward the rear of the car. \"My wife has moments\nwhen she does not want to get rid of the old house. It has been with her\nfor many years.\"\n\nTed Graham said, \"Oh.\" Then: \"Are you Spanish?\"\n\nRush hesitated. \"No. We are Basque.\"\n\nHe turned the car down a well-lighted avenue that merged into a highway.\nThey turned onto a side road. There followed more turns--left, right,\nright.\n\nTed Graham lost track.\n\nThey hit a jolting bump that made Martha gasp.\n\n\"I hope that wasn't too rough on you,\" said Rush. \"We're almost there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe car swung into a lane, its lights picking out the skeleton outlines\nof trees: peculiar trees--tall, gaunt, leafless. They added to Ted\nGraham's feeling of uneasiness.\n\nThe lane dipped, ended at a low wall of a house--red brick with\nclerestory windows beneath overhanging eaves. The effect of the wall and\na wide-beamed door they could see to the left was ultramodern.\n\nTed Graham helped his wife out of the car, followed the Rushes to the\ndoor.\n\n\"I thought you told me it was an old house,\" he said.\n\n\"It was designed by one of the first modernists,\" said Rush. He fumbled\nwith an odd curved key. The wide door swung open onto a hallway equally\nwide, carpeted by a deep pile rug. They could glimpse floor-to-ceiling\nview windows at the end of the hall, city lights beyond.\n\nMartha Graham gasped, entered the hall as though in a trance. Ted Graham\nfollowed, heard the door close behind them.\n\n\"It's so--so--so _big_,\" exclaimed Martha Graham.\n\n\"You want to trade _this_ for our trailer?\" asked Ted Graham.\n\n\"It's too inconvenient for us,\" said Rush. \"My work is over the\nmountains on the coast.\" He shrugged. \"We cannot sell it.\"\n\nTed Graham looked at him sharply. \"Isn't there any money around here?\"\nHe had a sudden vision of a tax accountant with no customers.\n\n\"Plenty of money, but no real estate customers.\"\n\nThey entered the living room. Sectional divans lined the walls. Subdued\nlighting glowed from the corners. Two paintings hung on the opposite\nwalls--oblongs of odd lines and twists that made Ted Graham dizzy.\n\nWarning bells clamored in his mind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMartha Graham crossed to the windows, looked at the lights far away\nbelow. \"I had no idea we'd climbed that far,\" she said. \"It's like a\nfairy city.\"\n\nMrs. Rush emitted a short, nervous laugh.\n\nTed Graham glanced around the room, thought: _If the rest of the house\nis like this, it's worth fifty or sixty thousand_. He thought of the\ntrailer: _A good one, but not worth more than seven thousand_.\n\nUneasiness was like a neon sign flashing in his mind. \"This seems\nso ...\" He shook his head.\n\n\"Would you like to see the rest of the house?\" asked Rush.\n\nMartha Graham turned from the window. \"Oh, yes.\"\n\nTed Graham shrugged. _No harm in looking_, he thought.\n\nWhen they returned to the living room, Ted Graham had doubled his\nprevious estimate on the house's value. His brain reeled with the\nsumming of it: a solarium with an entire ceiling covered by sun lamps,\nan automatic laundry where you dropped soiled clothing down a chute,\ntook it washed and ironed from the other end ...\n\n\"Perhaps you and your wife would like to discuss it in private,\" said\nRush. \"We will leave you for a moment.\"\n\nAnd they were gone before Ted Graham could protest.\n\nMartha Graham said, \"Ted, I honestly never in my life dreamed--\"\n\n\"Something's very wrong, honey.\"\n\n\"But, Ted--\"\n\n\"This house is worth at least a hundred thousand dollars. Maybe more.\nAnd they want to trade _this_--\" he looked around him--\"for a\nseven-thousand-dollar trailer?\"\n\n\"Ted, they're foreigners. And if they're so foolish they don't know the\nvalue of this place, then why should--\"\n\n\"I don't like it,\" he said. Again he looked around the room, recalled\nthe fantastic equipment of the house. \"But maybe you're right.\"\n\nHe stared out at the city lights. They had a lacelike quality: tall\nbuildings linked by lines of flickering incandescence. Something like a\nRoman candle shot skyward in the distance.\n\n\"Okay!\" he said. \"If they want to trade, let's go push the deal ...\"\n\nAbruptly, the house shuddered. The city lights blinked out. A humming\nsound filled the air.\n\nMartha Graham clutched her husband's arm. \"Ted! Wha-- what was that?\"\n\n\"I dunno.\" He turned. \"Mr. Rush!\"\n\nNo answer. Only the humming.\n\nThe door at the end of the room opened. A strange man came through it.\nHe wore a short toga-like garment of gray, metallic cloth belted at the\nwaist by something that glittered and shimmered through every color of\nthe spectrum. An aura of coldness and power emanated from him--a sense\nof untouchable hauteur.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe glanced around the room, spoke in the same tongue the Rushes had\nused.\n\nTed Graham said, \"I don't understand you, mister.\"\n\nThe man put a hand to his flickering belt. Both Ted and Martha Graham\nfelt themselves rooted to the floor, a tingling sensation vibrating\nalong every nerve.\n\nAgain the strange language rolled from the man's tongue, but now the\nwords were understood.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"My name's Graham. This is my wife. What's going--\"\n\n\"How did you get here?\"\n\n\"The Rushes--they wanted to trade us this house for our trailer. They\nbrought us. Now look, we--\"\n\n\"What is your talent--your occupation?\"\n\n\"Tax accountant. Say! Why all these--\"\n\n\"That was to be expected,\" said the man. \"Clever! Oh, excessively\nclever!\" His hand moved again to the belt. \"Now be very quiet. This may\nconfuse you momentarily.\"\n\nColored lights filled both the Grahams' minds. They staggered.\n\n\"You are qualified,\" said the man. \"You will serve.\"\n\n\"Where are we?\" demanded Martha Graham.\n\n\"The coordinates would not be intelligible to you,\" he said. \"I am of\nthe Rojac. It is sufficient for you to know that you are under Rojac\nsovereignty.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTed Graham said, \"But--\"\n\n\"You have, in a way, been kidnapped. And the Raimees have fled to your\nplanet--an unregistered planet.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" Martha Graham said shakily.\n\n\"You have nothing to fear,\" said the man. \"You are no longer on the\nplanet of your birth--nor even in the same galaxy.\" He glanced at Ted\nGraham's wrist. \"That device on your wrist--it tells your local time?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That will help in the search. And your sun--can you describe its atomic\ncycle?\"\n\nTed Graham groped in his mind for his science memories from school, from\nthe Sunday supplements. \"I can recall that our galaxy is a spiral\nlike--\"\n\n\"Most galaxies are spiral.\"\n\n\"Is this some kind of a practical joke?\" asked Ted Graham.\n\nThe man smiled, a cold, superior smile. \"It is no joke. Now I will make\nyou a proposition.\"\n\nTed nodded warily. \"All right, let's have the stinger.\"\n\n\"The people who brought you here were tax collectors we Rojac recruited\nfrom a subject planet. They were conditioned to make it impossible for\nthem to leave their job untended. Unfortunately, they were clever enough\nto realize that if they brought someone else in who could do their job,\nthey were released from their mental bonds. Very clever.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"You may have their job,\" said the man. \"Normally, you would be put to\nwork in the lower echelons, but we believe in meting out justice\nwherever possible. The Raimees undoubtedly stumbled on your planet by\naccident and lured you into this position without--\"\n\n\"How do you know I can do your job?\"\n\n\"That moment of brilliance was an aptitude test. You passed. Well, do\nyou accept?\"\n\n\"What about our baby?\" Martha Graham worriedly wanted to know.\n\n\"You will be allowed to keep it until it reaches the age of\ndecision--about the time it will take the child to reach adult\nstature.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Then what?\" insisted Martha Graham.\n\n\"The child will take its position in society--according to its ability.\"\n\n\"Will we ever see our child after that?\"\n\n\"Possibly.\"\n\nTed Graham said, \"What's the joker in this?\"\n\nAgain the cold, superior smile. \"You will receive conditioning similar\nto that which we gave the Raimees. And we will want to examine your\nmemories to aid us in our search for your planet. It would be good to\nfind a new inhabitable place.\"\n\n\"Why did they trap us like this?\" asked Martha Graham.\n\n\"It's lonely work,\" the man explained. \"Your house is actually a type of\nspace conveyance that travels along your collection route--and there is\nmuch travel to the job. And then--you will not have friends, nor time\nfor much other than work. Our methods are necessarily severe at times.\"\n\n\"_Travel?_\" Martha Graham repeated in dismay.\n\n\"Almost constantly.\"\n\nTed Graham felt his mind whirling. And behind him, he heard his wife\nsobbing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Raimees sat in what had been the Grahams' trailer.\n\n\"For a few moments, I feared he would not succumb to the bait,\" she\nsaid. \"I knew you could never overcome the mental compulsion enough to\nleave them there without their first agreeing.\"\n\nRaimee chuckled. \"Yes. And now I'm going to indulge in everything the\nRojac never permitted. I'm going to write ballads and poems.\"\n\n\"And I'm going to paint,\" she said. \"Oh, the delicious freedom!\"\n\n\"Greed won this for us,\" he said. \"The long study of the Grahams paid\noff. They couldn't refuse to trade.\"\n\n\"I knew they'd agree. The looks in their eyes when they saw the house!\nThey both had ...\" She broke off, a look of horror coming into her eyes.\n\"One of them did not agree!\"\n\n\"They both did. You heard them.\"\n\n\"The baby?\"\n\nHe stared at his wife. \"But--but it is not at the age of decision!\"\n\n\"In perhaps eighteen of this planet's years, it _will_ be at the age of\ndecision. What then?\"\n\nHis shoulders sagged. He shuddered. \"I will not be able to fight it off.\nI will have to build a transmitter, call the Rojac and confess!\"\n\n\"And they will collect another inhabitable place,\" she said, her voice\nflat and toneless.\n\n\"I've spoiled it,\" he said. \"I've spoiled it!\"\n\n                                                       --FRANK HERBERT\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ April 1958.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
