The man-figure that stood half crouched in the\nmouth of the cave involuntarily shivered.\n\n\"Gwanga!\" he said. \"He goes, too!\"\n\nBut the man did not move more than to shift a club to his right hand.\nHeavy, that club, and knotted and with a head of stone tied and\nwrapped with leather thongs; but Gor of the tribe of Zoran swung it\neasily with one of his long arms. He paid only casual attention as the\ngreat cat passed on into the night.\n\nOne leathery hand was raised to shield his slitted eyes; the wind from\nthe north struck toward the mouth of the cave, and it brought with it\ncold driving rain and whirling flurries of frozen pellets that bit and\nstung.\n\nSnow! Gor had traveled far, but never had he seen a storm like this\nwith white cold in the air. Again a shiver that was part fear rippled\nthrough his muscles and gripped with invisible fingers at his knotted\narms.\n\n\"The Beast of the North is angry!\" he told himself.\n\nThrough the dark and storm, animals drifted past before the blasts of\ncold. They were fleeing; they were full of fear--fear of something\nthat the dull mind of Gor could not picture. But in that mind was the\nsame wordless panic.\n\nGor, the man-animal of that pre-glacial day, stared wondering,\nstupidly, into the storm with eyes like those of the wild pig. His\narms were long, almost to his knees; his hair, coarse and matted, hung\nin greasy locks about his savage face. Behind his low, retreating\nforehead was place for little of thought or reason. Yet Gor was a man,\nand he met the threat of disaster by something better than blind,\nterrified, animal flight.\n\nA scant hundred in the tribe--men and women and little pot-bellied\nbrown children--Gor gathered them together in the cave far back from\nthe mouth.\n\n\"For many moons,\" he told them by words and signs, \"the fear has been\nupon us. There have been signs for us to see and for all the\nFour-feet--for Hathor, the great, and for little Wahti in his hole in\nthe sand-hill. Hathor has swung his long snout above his curved tusks\nand has cried his fear, and the Eaters of the Dead have circled above\nhim and cried _their_ cry.\n\n\"And now the Sun-god does not warm us. He has gone to hide behind the\nclouds. He is afraid--afraid of the cold monster that blows white\nstinging things in his breath.\n\n\"The Sun-god is gone--now, when he should be making hot summer! The\nFour-feet are going. Even Gwanga, the long-toothed, puts his tail\nbetween his legs and runs from the cold.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe naked bodies shivered in the chill that struck in from the\nstorm-wrapped world; they drew closer their coverings of fur and\nhides. The light of their flickering fires played strange tricks with\ntheir savage faces to make them still uglier and to show the dull\nterror that gripped them.\n\n\"Run--we must run--run away--the breath of the beast is on us--he\nfollows close--run....\" Through the mutterings and growls a sick child\nwhimpered once, then was still. Gor was speaking again:\n\n\"Run! Run away!\" he mocked them. \"And where shall the tribe of Zoran\ngo? With Gwanga, to make food for his cat belly or to be hammered to\ndeath with the stones of the great tribes of the south?\"\n\nThere was none to reply--only a despairing moan from ugly lips. Gor\nwaited, then answered his own question.\n\n\"No!\" he shouted, and beat upon his hairy chest that was round as the\ntrunk of a tree. \"Gor will save you--Gor, the wanderer! You named me\nwell: my feet have traveled far. Beyond the red-topped mountains of\nthe north I have gone; I have seen the tribes of the south, and I\nbrought you a head for proof. I have followed the sun, and I have gone\nwhere it rises.\"\n\nIn the half light, coarse strands of hair waved as hideous heads were\nnodded in confirmation of the boast, though many still drooped\ndespairingly.\n\n\"If Gor leads, where will he go?\" a voice demanded.\n\nAnother growled: \"Gor's feet have gone far: where have they gone where\nthe Beast cannot follow our scent?\"\n\n\"Down!\" said Gor with unconscious dramatic effect, and he pointed at\nthe rocky floor of the cave. \"I have gone where even the Beast of the\nNorth cannot go. The caves back of this you have seen, but only Gor\nhas seen the hole--the hole where a strong man can climb down; a hole\ntoo small for the great beast to get through. Gor has gone down to\nfind more caves below and more caves below them.\n\n\"Far down is a place where it is always warm. There is water in lakes\nand streams. Gor has caught fish in that water, and they were good.\nThere are growing things like the round earth-plants that come in the\nnight, and they, too, were good.\n\n\"Will you follow Gor?\" he demanded. \"And when the Beast is gone and\nthe Sun-god comes back we will return--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe blast that found its way inside the cave furnished its own answer;\nthe echoing, \"We follow! We follow!\" spoken through chattering teeth\nwas not needed. The women of the tribe shivered more from the cold\nthan from fear as they gathered together their belongings, their furs\nand hides and crude stone implements; and the shambling man-shape,\ncalled Gor, led them to the hole down which a strong man might climb,\nled them down and still down....\n\nBut, as to the rest--Gor's promise of safe return to the light of day\nand that outer world where the Sun-god shone--how was Gor to know that\na mighty glacier would lock the whole land in ice for endless years,\nand, retreating, leave their upper caves filled and buried under a\nvalley heaped with granite rocks?\n\nEven had the way been open to the land above, Gor himself could never\nhave known when that ice-sheet left. For when that day came and once\nmore the Sun-god drew steamy spirals from the drenched and thawing\nground, Gor, deep down in the earth, had been dead for countless\nyears. Only the remote descendants of that earlier tribe now lived in\ntheir subterranean home, though even with them there were some who\nspoke at times of those legends of another world which their ancestors\nhad left.\n\nAnd through the long centuries, while evolution worked its slow\nchanges, they knew nothing of the vanishing ice, of the sun and the\ngushing waters, the grass and forests that came to cover the earth.\nNor did their descendants, exploring interminable caves, learning to\ntame the internal fires, always evolving, always growing, have any\nremote conception of a people who sailed strange seas to find new\nlands and live and multiply and build up a country of sky-reaching\ncities and peaceful farmlands, of sunlit valleys and hills.\n\nBut always there were adventurous souls who made their way deeper and\ndeeper into the earth; and among them in every generation was one\nnamed Gor who was taught the tribal legends and who led the\nadventurers on. But legends have a trick of changing, and instead of\nsearching upward, it was through the deeper strata that they made\ntheir slow way in their search for a mystic god and the land of their\nfathers' fathers....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n_A Man Named Smith_\n\n\nHeat! Heat of a white-hot sun only two hours old. Heat of blazing\nsands where shimmering, gassy waves made the sparse sagebrush seem\nabout to burst into flames. Heat of a wind that might have come out of\nthe fire-box of a Mogul on an upgrade pull.\n\nA highway twisted among black masses of outcropping lava rock or\ntightened into a straightaway for miles across the desert that swept\nup to the mountain's base. The asphalt surface of the pavement was\nalmost liquid; it clung stickily to the tires of a big car, letting go\nwith a continuous, ripping sound.\n\nBehind the wheel of the weatherbeaten, sunburned car, Dean Rawson\nsquinted his eyes against the glare. His lean, tanned face was almost\nas brown as his hair. The sun had done its work there; it had set\ncrinkly lines about the man's eyes of darker brown. But the deeper\nlines in that young face had been etched by responsibility; they made\nthe man seem older than his twenty-three years, until the steady eyes,\nflashing into quick amusement, gave them the lie.\n\nAnd now Rawson's lips twisted into a little grin at his own\ndiscomfort--but he knew the desert driver's trick.\n\n\"A hundred plus in the shade,\" he reasoned silently. \"That's hot any\nway you take it. But taking it in the face at forty-five an hour is\ntoo much like looking into a Bessemer converter!\"\n\nHe closed the windows of his old coupe to within an inch of the top,\nthen opened the windshield a scant half inch. The blast that had been\ndrawing the moisture from his body became a gently circulating current\nof hot air.\n\nHe had gone only another ten miles after these preparations for fast\ndriving, when he eased the big weatherbeaten car to a stop.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn his right, reaching up to the cool heights under a cloudless blue\nsky, the gray peaks of the Sierras gave promise of relief from the\nfurnace breath of the desert floor. There were even valleys of snow\nglistening whitely where the mountains held them high. A watcher, had\nthere been one to observe in the empty land, might have understood\nanother traveler's pausing to admire the serene majesty of those\nheights--but he would have wondered could he have seen Rawson's eyes\nturned in longing away from the mountains while he stared across the\nforbidding sands.\n\nThere were other mountains, lavender and gray, in the distance. And\nnearer by, a matter of twenty or thirty elusive miles through the\ndancing waves of hot air, were other barren slopes. Across the rolling\nsand-hills wheel marks, faint and wind-blown, led straight from the\nhighway toward the parched peaks.\n\n\"Tonah Basin!\" Rawson was thinking. \"It's there inside these hills.\nIt's hotter than this is by twenty degrees right this minute--but I\nwish I could see it. I'd like to have one more look before I face that\nhard-boiled bunch in the city!\"\n\nHe looked at his watch and shook his head. \"Not a chance,\" he\nadmitted. \"I'm due up in Erickson's office in five hours. I wonder if\nI've got a chance with them....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFive hours of driving, and Rawson walked into the office of Erickson,\nIncorporated, with a steady step. Another hour, and his tanned face\nhad gone a trifle pale; his lips were set grimly in a straight line\nthat would not relax under the verdict he felt certain he was about to\nhear.\n\nFor an hour he had faced the steely-eyed man across the long table in\nthe Directors Room--faced him and replied to questions from this man\nand the half-dozen others seated there. Skeptical questions, tricky\nquestions; and now the man was speaking:\n\n\"Rawson, six months ago you laid your Tonah Basin plans before\nus--plans to get power from the center of the Earth, to utilize that\nenergy, and to control the power situation in this whole Southwest.\nIt looked like a wild gamble then, but we investigated. It still looks\nlike a gamble.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Rawson, \"it is a gamble. Did I ever call it anything\nelse?\"\n\n\"The Ehrmann oscillator,\" the man continued imperturbably, \"invented\nin 1940, two years ago, solves the wireless transmission problem, but\nthe success of your plan depends upon your own invention--upon your\nstraight-line drills that you say will not wander off at a tangent\nwhen they get down a few miles. And more than that, it depends upon\nyou.\n\n\"Even that does not damn the scheme; but, Rawson, there's only one\nfactor we gamble on. No wild plans, no matter how many hundreds of\nmillions they promise: no machines, no matter what they are designed\nto do, get a dollar of our backing. It's men we back with our money!\"\n\nRawson's face was set to show no emotion, but within his mind were\ninsistent, clamoring thoughts:\n\n\"Why can't he say it and get it over with? I've lost--what a\nhard-boiled bunch they are!--but he doesn't need to drag out the\nagony.\" But--but what was the man saying?\n\n\"Men, Rawson!\" the emotionless voice continued. \"And we've checked up\non you from the time you took your nourishment out of a bottle; it's\nyou we're backing. That's why we have organized the little company of\nThermal Explorations, Limited. That's why we've put a million of hard\ncoin into it. That's why we've put you in charge of operations.\"\n\nHe was extending a hand that Dean Rawson had to reach for blindly.\n\n\"I'd drill through to hell,\" Dean said and fought to keep his voice\nsteady, \"with backing like that!\"\n\nHe allowed his emotion to express itself in a shaky laugh. \"Perhaps I\nwill at that,\" he added: \"I'll certainly be heading in the right\ndirection.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder another day's sun the hot asphalt was again taking the print of\nthe tires of Rawson's old car. But this time, when he came to the\nalmost obliterated marks that led through the sand toward distant\nmountains, he stopped, partially deflated the tires to give them a\ngrip on the sand, and swung off.\n\n\"A fool, kid trick,\" he admitted to himself, \"but I want to see the\nplace. I'll see plenty of it before I'm through, but right now I've\ngot to have a look; then I'll buckle down to work.\n\n\"Thermal Explorations, Limited!\" The name rang triumphantly in his\nmind. \"A million things to do--men, crews for the drills, derricks....\nWe'll have to truck in over this road; I'll lay a plank road over the\nsand. And water--we'll have to haul that, too, until we can sink a\nwell. We'll find water under there somewhere. I've got to see the\nplace....\"\n\nThe black sides of the mountains were nearer: every outcropping rock\nwas plainly volcanic, and great sweeping slopes were beds of ash and\npumice; the wheel marks, where they showed at all, wound off and into\na canyon hidden in the tremendous hills that thrust themselves\nabruptly from the desert floor.\n\nThe mountains themselves towered hugely at closer range, but the road\nthat Rawson followed climbed through them without traversing the\nhighest slopes. It was scarcely more than a trail, barely wide enough\nfor the car at times, but boulder-filled gullies showed where the\nhands of men had worked to build it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe came at last into the open where a shoulder of rock bent the road\noutward above a sea of sand far below. And now the mountains showed\ntheir circular arrangement--a great ring, twenty miles across. At one\nside were three conical peaks, unmistakable craters, whose scarred\nsides were smothered under ash and sand that had rained down from\ntheir shattered tops in ages past. Yet, so hot they were, so clear-cut\nthe irregularly rimmed cups at their tops, that they seemed to have\npushed themselves up through the earth in that very instant. At their\nbases were signs of human habitation--broken walls, scattered stone\nbuildings whose empty windows gaped blackly. This was all that\nremained of New Rhyolite.\n\nRawson looked at the \"ghost town\" which had never failed to interest\nhim, but he gave no thought now to the hardy prospectors who had built\nit or to the vein of gold that had failed them. His searching eyes\ncame back to the fiery pit, the Tonah Basin, a vast cauldron of sand\nand ash--great sweeps of yellow and gray and darker brown into which\nthe sun was pouring its rays with burning-glass fierceness.\n\nBut to Rawson, there was more than the eye could see. He was picturing\na great powerhouse, steel derricks, capped pipes that led off to\nwhirring turbines, generators, strings of cables stretching out on\nsteel supports into the distance, a wireless transmitter--and all of\nthis the result of his own vision, of the stream he would bring from\ndeep in the earth!\n\nThen, abruptly, the pictures faded. Far below him on the yellow,\nsun-blasted floor, a fleck of shadow had moved. It appeared suddenly\nfrom the sand, moved erratically, staggeringly, for a hundred feet,\nthen vanished as if something had blotted it out--and Dean Rawson\nknew that it was the shadow of a man.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe road widened beyond the turn. He had intended to swing around; he\nhad wanted only to take a clear picture of the place with him. But now\nthe big car's gears wailed as he took the downgrade in second, and the\nbrakes, jammed on at the sharp curves, added their voice to the chorus\nof haste.\n\n\"Confounded desert rats!\" Rawson was saying under his breath. \"They'll\nchance anything--but imagine crossing country like that! And he hasn't\na burro--he's got only the water he can carry in a canteen!\"\n\nBut even the canteen was empty, he found, when he stopped the car in a\nwhirl of loose sand beside a prone figure whose khaki clothes were\nalmost indistinguishable against the desert soil.\n\nBefore Rawson could get his own lanky six feet of wiry length from the\ncar, the man had struggled to his feet. Again the little blot of\nshadow began its wavering, uncertain, forward movement.\n\nHe was a little shorter than Rawson, a little heavier of build, and\nyounger by a year or two, although his flushed face and a two days'\nstubble of black beard might have been misleading. Rawson caught the\nstaggering man and half carried him to the shadow of the car, the only\nshelter in that whole vast cauldron of the sun.\n\nFrom a mouth where a swollen tongue protruded thickly came an agonized\nsound that was a cry for, \"Water--water!\" Rawson gave it to him as\nrapidly as he dared, until he allowed the man to drink from the desert\nbag at the last. And his keen eyes were taking in all the significant\ndetails as he worked.\n\nThe khaki clothes earned a nod of silent approval. The compact roll\nthat had been slung from the younger man's shoulders, even the broad\nshoulders themselves, and the square jaw, unshaved and grimy, got\nRawson's inaudible, \"O. K.!\" But the face was more burned than tanned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe introduced himself when the stranger was able to stand. \"I'm\nRawson, Dean Rawson, mining engineer when I'm working at it,\" he\nexplained. \"I'm bound north. I'll take you out of this. You can travel\nwith me as far as you please.\"\n\nThe dark-haired youngster was plainly youthful now, as he stood erect.\nHis voice was recovering what must have been its usual hearty ring.\n\n\"I'm not trying to say 'thank you,'\" he said, as he took Rawson's\nhand. \"I was sure sunk--going down for the last time--taps--all that\nsort of thing! You pulled me out--the good old helping hand. Can't\nthank a fellow for that--just return the favor or pass it on to\nsomeone else. And, by the way--you won't believe it--but my name is\nSmith.\"\n\nRawson smiled good-naturedly. \"No,\" he agreed, \"I don't believe it.\nBut it's a good, handy name. All right, Smithy, jump in! Here, let me\ngive you a lift; you're still woozy.\"\n\nRawson found his passenger uncommunicative. Not but what Smithy talked\nfreely of everything but himself, but it was of himself that Rawson\nwanted to know.\n\n\"Drop me at the first town,\" said Smithy. \"You're going north: I'm\nsouth-bound--looking for a job down in Los. I won't take any more\nshort cuts; I was two days on this last one. I'll stick to the road.\"\n\nThey were through the mountains that ringed in the fiery pit of Tonah\nBasin. Smooth sand lay ahead; only the shallow marks that his own\ntires had ploughed needed to be followed. Dean Rawson turned and\nlooked with fair appraisal at the man he had saved.\n\n\"Drifter?\" he asked himself silently. \"Road bum? He doesn't look the\npart; there's something about him....\"\n\nAloud he inquired: \"What's your line? What do you know?\"\n\nAnd the young man answered frankly: \"Not a thing!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDean sensed failure, inefficiency. He resented it in this youngster\nwho had fought so gamely with death. His voice was harsh with a\ncurious sense of his own disappointment as he asked:\n\n\"Found the going too hard for you up north, did you? Well, it won't be\nany easier--\" But Smithy had interrupted with a weak movement of his\nhand.\n\n\"Not too hard,\" he said laconically; \"too damn soft! I don't know what\nI'm looking for--pretty dumb: got a lot to learn!--but it'll be a job\nthat needs to take a good licking!\"\n\n\"'Too damn soft!'\" Dean was thinking. \"And he tackled the desert\nalone!\" There was a lot here he did not understand. But the look in\nthe eyes of Smithy that met his own searching gaze and returned it\nsquarely if a bit whimsically--that was something he _could_\nunderstand. Dean Rawson was a judge of men. The sudden impulse that\nmoved him was founded upon certainty.\n\n\"You've found that job,\" he said. \"The desert almost got you a little\nwhile ago--now it's due to take that licking you were talking about.\nI'm going to teach it to lie down and roll over and jump through\nhoops. Fact is, my job is to get it into harness and put it to work.\nI'll be working right out there in the Basin where I found you. It\nwill be only about two degrees cooler than hell. If that sounds good\nto you, Smithy, stick around.\"\n\nHe warmed oddly to the look in the younger man's deep-set, dark eyes,\nas Smithy replied:\n\n\"Try to put me out, Rawson--just try to put me out!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_Gold!_\n\n    \"Ten miles down, drillers!\n    Hell-bound, and proud of it!\n    Ten miles down, drillers!\n    Hark to what I say:\n    You're pokin' through the crust of hell\n    And braggin' too damn loud of it,\n    For, when you get to hell, you'll find\n    The devil there to pay.\"\n\n\nFrom the black, night-wrapped valley, far below, the singer's voice\nwent silent with the slamming of a door in one of the bunkhouses. The\nsong was popular; some rimester in the Tonah Basin camp had written\nthe parody for the tormenting of the drill crews. And, high on the\nmountainside, Dean Rawson hummed a few bars of the lilting air after\nthe singer's voice had ceased.\n\n\"Ten miles down!\" he said at last to his assistant, sprawled out on\nthe stone beside him. \"That's about right, Smithy. And maybe the rest\nof the doggerel isn't so far off either. 'Pokin' through the crust of\nhell'--well, there was hell popping around here once, and I am\ngambling that the furnaces aren't all out.\"\n\nThey were on the outthrust shoulder of rock where the mountain road\nhung high above the valley floor. Below, where, months before, Rawson\nhad rescued a man from desert death, was blackness punctured by points\nof light--bunkhouse windows, the drilling-floor lights at the foot of\na big derrick, a single warning light at the derrick's top. But the\nbuildings and the towering steelwork of the derrick that handled the\nrotary drills were dim and ghostly in the light of the stars.\n\n\"We've gone through some places I'd call plenty warm,\" said Smithy,\n\"but you--you craves it _hot_! Think we're about due?\" he asked.\n\nRawson answered indirectly.\n\n\"One great big old he-crater!\" he said. His outstretched arm swept the\nwhole circle of starlit mountains that enclosed the Basin. \"That's\nwhat this was once. Twenty miles across--and when it blew its head off\nit must have sprayed this whole Southwest.\n\n\"Now, those craters\"--he pointed contemptuously toward the three\nconical peaks off to the right--\"those were just blow-holes on the\nside of this big one.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the ragged ring of mountains, the throat of some volcanic monster\nof an earlier age, the three cones towered hugely. Their tops were\nplainly cupped; their ashy sloping sides swept down to the desert\nfloor. At their base, the gray walls of stone in the ghost town of\nLittle Rhyolite gleamed palely, like skeleton remains.\n\n\"I've seen steam, live steam,\" Rawson went on, \"coming out of a\nfissure in the rocks. I know there's heat and plenty of it down below.\nWe're about due to hit it. The boys are pulling the drill now; they\ncut through into a whale of a cave down below there--\"\n\nHe broke off abruptly to fix his attention on the dark valley below,\nwhere lights were moving. One white slash of brilliance cut across the\ndark ground; another, then a cluster of flood lights blazed out. They\npicked the skeleton framework of the giant derrick in black relief\nagainst the white glare of the sand. From far below; through the\nquiet air, came sounds of excited shouting; the voices of men were\nraised in sudden clamor.\n\n\"They've pulled the drill,\" said Rawson. \"But why all the excitement?\"\n\nHe had already turned toward their car when the crackle of six quick\nshots came from below. His abrupt command was not needed; Smithy was\nin the car while still the echoes were rolling off among the hills.\nTheir own lights flashed on to show the mountain grade waiting for\ntheir quick descent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sandy floor of this part of the Tonah Basin was littered with the\norderly disorder of a big construction job--mountains of casing,\ntubular drill rod, a foot in diameter; segmental bearings to clamp\naround the rod every hundred feet and give it smooth play. Dean drove\nhis car swiftly along the surfaced road that was known as \"Main\nStreet\" to the entire camp.\n\nThere were men running toward the derrick--men of the day shift who\nhad been aroused from their sleep. Others were clustered about the\nwide concrete floor where the derrick stood. Clad only in trousers and\nshoes, their bodies, tanned by the desert sun, were almost black in\nthe glare of the big floods. They milled wildly about the derrick;\nand, through all their clamor and shouting, one word was repeated\nagain and again:\n\n\"Gold! Gold! Gold!\"\n\nThe big drill head was suspended above the floor. Dean Rawson, with\nSmithy close at hand, pushed through the crowd. He was prepared to see\ntraces of gold in the sludge that was bailed out through the hollow\nshaft--quartz, perhaps, whose richness had set the men wild before\nthey realized how impossible it would be to develop such a mine. But\nRawson stopped almost aghast at the glaring splendor of the golden\ndrill hanging naked in the blinding light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRiley, foreman of the night shift, was standing beside it, a pistol in\nhis hand. \"L'ave it be,\" he was commanding. \"Not a hand do ye lay on\nit till the boss gets here.\" At sight of Rawson he stepped forward.\n\n\"I shot in the air,\" he explained. \"I knew ye were up in the hills for\na breath of coolness. I wanted to get ye here quick.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Rawson tersely. \"But, man, what have you done with the\ndrill? It's smeared over with gold!\"\n\n\"Fair clogged wid it, sir,\" Riley's voice betrayed his own excitement.\n\"You remimber we couldn't pull it at first--the drill was jammed-like\nafter it bruk through at the ten-mile livil. Then it come free--and\nluk at it! Luk at the damn thing! Sent down for honest work, it was,\nand it comes back all dressed up in jewelry like a squaw Indian whin\nthere's oil struck on the reservation! Or is it gold ye were after all\nthe time?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Gold! Gold!\" a hundred voices were shouting. Dean hardly heard the\nvoice of the foreman, made suddenly garrulous with excitement. He\nstared at the big drill head, heaped high with the precious metal. It\nwas jammed into the diamond-studded face of the drill; it filled every\ncrack and crevice, a smooth, solid mass on top of the head and against\nthe stem. A workman had brought a singlejack and chisel; he was prying\nat a ribbon of the yellow stuff. Riley went for him, gun in hand.\n\n\"L'ave it be!\" he shouted.\n\n\"But, confound it all, Dean,\" Smithy's voice was saying in a tone of\ndisgust, \"I thought we were working on a power plant. Not that a gold\nmine is so bad; but we can't work it--we can't go down after it at ten\nmiles.\"\n\n\"Gold mine!\" Rawson echoed. \"I'll say it's a gold mine--but not\nbecause of the gold. Do you notice anything peculiar about that,\nSmithy?\"\n\nHis assistant replied with a quick exclamation:\n\n\"You're right, Dean! I knew there was something haywire with that.\nSolid chunk--been cast around that stem--melted on. And that means--\"\n\n\"Heat,\" said Rawson. \"It means we've found what we're after. Give the\ngold to the men; tell them we'll divide it evenly among them. There's\nmore down there, but there's something better: there's energy, power!\"\n\nHe snapped out quick orders. \"Get the temperature. Drop a recording\npyrometer. Let me know at once. There'll be plenty doing now!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDrill rods and cables, all were made of the newest aluminum alloy. The\nlong tube that held the pyrometer was formed of the same metal. Smithy\nsent it down to get a recording of the temperatures of that\nsubterranean cave into which their tools had plunged.\n\nHe adjusted the recording mechanism himself and stood beside the\ntwenty-inch casing that held back the loose sand from the big bore.\nThen he watched ten sections of cable, each a mile in length, each\nheavier than the last, as they went hissing into the earth.\n\nFrom the cable control shed the voice of Riley was calling the depth.\n\n\"Fifty-two thousand.\" Then by hundreds until he cried:\n\"Fifty-two-seven. We're into the big cave! Now another hundred feet.\"\n\nThe cable was moving slowly. In the middle of Riley's call of\n\"Fifty-two-eight,\" a jangling bell told that the bottom of the\npyrometer carrier had touched.\n\n\"Up with it,\" Smithy ordered. \"Make it snappy. We'll see if we've got\nanother cargo of gold.\"\n\nThere was an undeniable thrill in this reaching to a tremendous\ndistance underground, this groping about in a deep-hidden cave, where\nmolten gold was to be found. What had they tapped?--he asked himself.\nHe saw visions of some vast pool of hot, liquid gold. Perhaps Dean\nwould have to change his plans. They could rig up some kind of a\nbailer; they could bring out thousands of dollars at a time.\n\nHe was watching for the first sight of the metal carrier, far more\ninterested in what might be clinging to it than in the record of the\npyrometer it held. He saw it emerge--then he stared in disbelief at\nthe stubby mass at the cable's end, where all that remained of the\nlong tube he had sent down was a dangling two feet of discolored\nmetal, warped and distorted. The lower part, a full twenty feet in\nlength, had been fused cleanly off.\n\nDean Rawson was there to watch the next attempt. Again Riley's roaring\nbass rolled out the count, but this time the call stopped at\nfifty-two-seven. The jangling bell told that the carrier had touched.\n\n\"Divil a bit do I understand this,\" Riley was calling. \"We're right at\nthe point where we dropped through into the clear. Right at the roof\nof the big cave--fifty-two-seven, it says--and no lower do we go. The\nbottom of the hole is plugged!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRawson made no reply. He was scowling while he stared speculatively at\nthe mouth of the twenty-inch bore--a vertical tunnel that led from the\ndrilling floor down, down to some inner vault. \"Molten gold,\" he was\nthinking. \"It melted a cylinder of the new Krieger alloy--melted it\nwhen its melting point is way higher than that of any rock that we've\nhit. And now the bore is closed....\"\n\nHe was trying vainly to project his mental vision through those miles\nof hard rock to see what manner of mystery this was into which he had\nprobed. He shook his head slowly in baffled speculation, then spoke\nsharply.\n\n\"Drill it out!\" he ordered. \"We're into a hot spot sure enough, though\nI can't just figure out the how of it. But we'll tame it, Smithy. Send\ndown the drill. Clean it out. Then we'll poke around down there and\nget the answer to all this.\"\n\nFive days were needed to send down the big drill with a new drill-head\nreplacing the other too fouled with gold for any use. The tubular\nsections, a hundred feet in length, were hooked together and lowered\none by one. Each joint meant the coupling of the air-pipe as well.\nAir, mixed with water from the outer jacket, must come foaming up\nthrough the central core to bring the powdered rock to the surface.\n\nFive days, then one hour of boring, and another five days to pull out\nthe drill before Rawson could hope for his answer. But he found it in\nthe severed shaft of the great drill where the head had been melted\ncompletely off. The big stem that would have resisted all but electric\nfurnace heat, and been cut through like a tallow candle in the blast\nof an oxy-acetylene flame.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_Red Drops_\n\n\nThe flat-roofed shack of yellow boards that was Dean Rawson's \"office\"\nhad a second canopy roof built above it and extending out on all sides\nlike a wooden umbrella. Thick pitch fried almost audibly from the fir\nboards when the sun drove straight from overhead, but beneath their\nshelter the heat was more bearable.\n\nBy an open window, where a hot breeze stirred sluggishly, Rawson sat\nin silent contemplation of the camp. His face was as copper-colored as\nan Apache's and as motionless. His eyes were fixed unwaveringly upon a\ndistant derrick and the blasted stub of a big drill that hung unmoving\nabove the concrete floor.\n\nBut the man's eyes did not consciously record the details of that\nscene. He saw nothing of the derrick or of the heat waves that made\nthe steel seem writhingly alive; he was looking at something far more\ndistant, something many miles away, something vague and mysterious,\nhidden miles beneath the surface of the earth.\n\n\"Heat,\" he said at last, as if talking in a dream. \"Heat, terrific\ntemperatures--but I can't make it out; I can't see it!\"\n\nThe younger, broad-shouldered man, whose khaki shirt, thrown open at\nthe neck showed a chest tanned to the black-brown of his face, stopped\nhis restless pacing back and forth in the hot room.\n\n\"Yes?\" he asked with a touch of irritation in his tone. \"There's\nplenty of heat there--heat enough to melt off the shaft of that\nhigh-temp alloy! What the devil's the use of wondering about the heat,\nDean? What gets me is this: the shaft has been plugged again. Now,\nwhat kind of....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDean Rawson's face had not moved a muscle during the other's outburst.\nHis eyes were still fixed on that place that was so far away, yet\nwhich he tried to bring close in his mind, close enough to see, to\ncomprehend the mystery that should be so plain.\n\n\"Lava wouldn't do it!\" he said softly. \"No melted stone would melt the\nKrieger alloy, unless it was under pressure, which this was not.\nThere was no blast coming out of our shaft. Yet we dipped into that\ngold; we stuck the drill right down into it. But what did we go into\nthe next time? What did we dip into?\"\n\nHe swung quickly, violently, toward Smithy who was facing him from the\nmiddle of the room. He aimed one finger at him as if it were a pistol,\nand his words cracked out as sharply as if they came from a gun:\n\n\"That tube you sent down--that piece of casing! How was it burned?\nWere there straggling ends, frozen gobs of metal? Did it look like an\nold-fashioned molasses candy bar that's been melted? Did it?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" said Smithy. \"It hadn't dripped any; it was cut off nice\nand clean.\"\n\n\"Cut!\" Rawson almost shouted the word. \"You said it, Smithy. So was\nthe shaft of the drill. And if you ever saw a piece of this alloy\nbeing melted you know that it's as gummy as a pot of old paint. It was\ncut, Smithy! Dipping into that melted gold threw us off the track; we\nwere thinking of ramming the drill down into a mess of lava. But we\ndidn't. It was cut off by a blast of flame so much hotter than lava\nthat melted rock would seem cold!\"\n\n\"And that helps us a lot, doesn't it,\" asked Smithy, scornfully, \"when\nthe flame melts the end of the shaft shut as fast as we open it?\"\n\nDean Rawson's lean, muscular hands took Smithy's broad shoulders and\nspun the younger man around. \"Cheer up,\" Dean told him. \"We've got it\nlicked. Why it doesn't blow out of that shaft like hell out for noon\nis more than I can see; but the heat's there! We've won!\"\n\n\"But--\" Smithy began. Rawson sent him spinning toward the door in a\ngood-natured showing of strength that his assistant had not yet\nguessed.\n\n\"Soup!\" he ordered. \"Break out the nitroglycerine, Smithy. Get that\nSwede, Hanson, on the job; he's a shooter. He knows his stuff. We'll\nblow open the bottom end of our shaft so it'll never go shut!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHanson knew his stuff and did it. But he met Rawson's inquiring eyes\nwith a puzzled shake of his head when the open mouth of the\ntwenty-inch bore gave faint echo of the deep explosion and followed\nafter a time with only a feeble puff of air.\n\n\"Like a cannon, she should have gone,\" Hanson stated. \"And she yoost\ngo _phht_!\"\n\n\"It's open down below,\" said Rawson briefly. \"This is a different kind\nof a well from the kind you've been shooting.\"\n\nTo the waiting Riley he said: \"Hook a bailer onto that cable and send\nit down. See what you can tell about the hole.\"\n\nAgain ten miles of cable hissed smoothly down the gaping throat. Then\nit slowed.\n\n\"Fifty-two-seven,\" said Riley, \"and she's open. Seven twenty-five!\nSeven fifty, and we're on bottom!\"\n\n\"Up,\" Rawson ordered, \"if there's anything left of the bailer. It's\nprobably melted into scrap.\"\n\nBut strangely it was not. It hung from the dangling cable spinning\nlazily until Riley stepped in to check its motion.\n\nThere was a check valve in the bottom--a door that opened inwardly, to\ntake in water and fragments of rock when need arose. Riley,\ndisregarding the possible heat of the twirling bailer, reached for it\nwith bare hands. He drew them back, then held them before him--and a\nhundred watching eyes saw what had been unseen before: the slow\ndropping of red liquid from the bailer's end. The same drops were\nfalling from Riley's hands that had touched that end.\n\n\"Blood!\" The word came from the foreman's throat in one horrified\ngasp. It ran in a whispering echo from one to another of the watching\ncrew. From far across the hot sands came the rattle of a truck that\nbrought the first of many loads of cement and steel for Rawson's\nbuildings. Its driver was singing lustily:\n\n    \"Hark to what I say:\n    You're pokin' through the crust of hell\n    And braggin' too damn loud of it,\n    For, when you get to hell, you'll find\n    The devil there to pay!\"\n\nBut Rawson, looking dazedly into Smithy's eyes, said only: \"It's\ncold--the bailer's cold. There's no heat there.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_The Light in the Crater_\n\n\n\"Of course it wasn't blood!\" said Smithy explosively. \"But try to tell\nthe men that. See how far you get. 'Devils!' That's been their talk\nsince yesterday when Riley got smeared up--and now that the bailer's\ngone we can't prove a thing.\"\n\nAgain he was pacing restlessly back and forth in the little board\nshack that was Rawson's field head-quarters. Rawson, seated by the\nwindow, was looking at tables of comparative melting points. He\nglanced up sharply.\n\n\"You haven't found it yet?\" he questioned. \"A forty-foot bailer! Now\nthat's a nice easy little thing to mislay.\"\n\nRiley had followed the excited Smithy into the room; he stood silently\nby the door until he caught Rawson's questioning glance.\n\n\"Forty feet or forty inches,\" he said, \"'tis gone! 'Twas there by the\nderrick last night, and this marnin'--\"\n\n\"That's fine,\" Rawson interrupted with heavy sarcasm. \"I haven't\nenough down below ground to keep my mind occupied--I need a few\nmysteries up top. Now do you really expect me to believe that a thing\nlike that bailer has been carried off?\"\n\nThis time it was Smithy who interrupted. \"You can just practise\nbelieving on that, Dean,\" he said. \"When you get so you can believe a\nforty-foot bailer can vanish into thin air, then you'll be ready for\nwhat I've got. This is what I came in to tell you: that one truckload\nof steel grillage beams for the turbine footings--they were put out\nwhere we surveyed for the first power house--dumped on the sand....\"\n\n\"Well?\" questioned Rawson, as Smithy paused. His look was daring\nSmithy to say what he knew was coming.\n\n\"Five tons of steel beams,\" said Smithy softly, \"gone--just like that!\nJust a hollow in the sand!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe big figure of the Irish foreman was still beside the door. Rawson\nsaw one clumsy hand make the sign of the Cross; then Riley held that\nhand before him and stared at it in horror. \"Divils' blood,\" he\nwhispered. \"And I dipped my hands in it. Saints protect us all!\"\n\n\"That will be all of that!\" Dean Rawson's usually quiet voice was as\nfull of crackling emphasis as if it had been charged with electrical\nenergy. \"If anyone thinks that I have gone this far, just to be scared\nout by some dirty sabotage....\n\n\"I see it all. I don't know how they did it, but it's all come since\nthe gold was found. Someone else wants it. They think they can scare\noff the men, maybe take a pot-shot at me, come back here and clean up\nlater on, pull up gold by the pailful, I suppose--\"\n\nRiley leaped forward and banged his big fist down on the table. \"Right\nye are!\" he shouted, until loitering men in the open \"street\" outside\nstared curiously. \"Divils they are, but they're the kind of divils we\nknow how to handle. And now I'll tell ye somethin' else, sir: I know\nwhere they are hidin'.\n\n\"There was no work for anyone last night, but I'm used to bein' up. I\ncouldn't sleep. I was wanderin' around, thinkin' of nothin' at all out\nof the way, and I thought I saw some shadows, like it might be men,\nway off on the sand. Then later over to the old ghost town, d'ye mind!\nI saw a light, a queer, green sort of light. Sure, a fool I was\ncallin' meself at the time, but now I believe it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDean Rawson had crossed the room while the man was still speaking. He\ndragged a wooden case from beneath his cot and smashed at the lid with a\nwrecking bar. Then he reached inside and drew forth a blue-black .45.\n\nHe tossed the pistol to Riley. \"Know how to use one of these?\" he\nasked. The manner in which the big Irishman snapped open the side\nejection was sufficient answer. Dean handed another gun to Smithy,\nthen pulled out more and laid them on his cot together with a little\npile of cartridge boxes.\n\n\"You're all right, Riley,\" he said. \"Just keep your head. Don't let\nyour damned superstitions run away with you, and I wouldn't ask for a\nbetter man to stand alongside of in a scrap.\"\n\nThe foreman beamed with pleasure: Rawson went on in crisp sentences:\n\n\"Take these guns. Take plenty of ammunition. Pick five or six men you\nknow you can depend on. Mount guard around this camp to-night. I'll\npost an order saying you're in charge--and I'm telling you now to use\nthose guns on anything you see.\n\n\"Smithy,\" he said to the other man who had been quietly listening,\n\"you and I are going to start for town. Only Riley will know that\nwe're gone for the night. We'll have a little listening post of our\nown up here in the hills.\"\n\nBut Rawson postponed their going. More material was arriving; one\ncasting in particular needed all the men and Rawson's supervision to\nplace it on the sand where an erection crew could swing it into place\nat some later date. And then, when he and Smithy had driven away from\ncamp with the distant city as their announced destination, Rawson\nstill did not go directly to the mountain grade. He swung off instead\nwhere rolling sand-hills blocked all view from the camp, and he headed\nthe car into a gusty wind that brought whirling clouds of dust; they\nalmost obscured the crumbling walls at the volcano's base.\n\nThe ghost towns that are found here and there in the forsaken\nwilderness of the West are depressing to one who walks their empty\nstreets. Little Rhyolite was no exception. In gray, ghostly walls,\nempty windows stared steadily, disconcertingly like sockets of dead\neyes in tattered, weatherbeaten skulls.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDean and Smithy walked among the roofless ruins. Lizards, the color of\nthe cold, gray walls, slipped from sight on silent, clinging feet.\nOnce a sidewinder, almost invisible against the sand, looped away from\nthe intruders with smooth deliberation.\n\n\"No marks here,\" said Rawson at last. \"Even an Indian can't read sign\nin this ashy sand when the wind has dusted it off.\"\n\nHe turned his head from a whirl of fine ash where the wind, sweeping\naround a wall of stone, was scouring at a sand dune's sloping side.\n\n\"Dean,\" said Smithy, \"old Riley may have been looking for banshees\nwhen he saw these lights. Superstitious old cuss, Riley! Maybe there\nwasn't anything here. But, Dean, there's some confoundedly funny\nthings happening around here.\"\n\n\"Are you telling me?\" Rawson asked grimly. \"But we want to remember\none thing,\" he added: \"We've punched a hole in the ground, and we've\ngot into a place that is hot enough to melt Krieger alloy one minute\nand is stone cold the next. That's disturbing enough, but we don't\nwant to get that mixed up with what's happening up top. There's dirty\nwork going on--\"\n\nHe stopped. His eyes, that had never ceased to search for some mark of\nspecial meaning, had come to rest upon an object half hidden in the\nsand. He stooped and picked it up.\n\n\"Now what the devil is this?\" Smithy began. But Rawson was staring at\nthe smooth lava block that was in his hand. It was tapered; it was\npierced through with a straight, smooth hole, and its base was round\nand ringed as if it had been held in a clamp.\n\n\"That,\" he said at last, \"was brought in from outside. Outside,\nSmithy--get that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDean Rawson's face was wreathed in a sudden smile of pure pleasure. \"No, I\ndon't know what the darn thing is,\" he admitted. \"And I don't care. But I\nknow that someone, or some bunch of someones--outsiders--are trying to\nhorn in. I might even go so far as to say that I suspect the power\nmonopoly gentlemen. I think they have started in on us, plan to run off\nour men, interfere in every way and drive me out of the field with the\nboring a failure. Smithy, I begin to think I'm going to enjoy this job!\"\n\nAgain the hot wind, only beginning to cool with the setting of the\nsun, swept around the building where they stood and tore at the hill\nof sand. \"Come on,\" said Rawson. \"It's getting dark. We'll get up to\nour lookout--\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" called Smithy sharply.\n\nRawson turned. Smithy was rubbing his eyes when the whirl of\nwind-borne sand had passed; he was staring at the sand dunes.\n\n\"I'm seeing things, I guess,\" he said. \"I thought for a minute there\nwas a hole there, and the sand was slipping. I'm getting as bad as\nRiley.\"\n\nThe two went back through the gathering shadows to their waiting car.\nAnd Smithy's involuntary shiver told Rawson that he was not the only\none to feel a sense of relief at the sound of the exhaust as their car\ntook them away from the dead bones of a dead city in a barren,\ntrackless waste.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe shoulder of rock, where the mountain road swung out, gave a\ncomprehensive view of camp and desert and the encircling mountains.\nAbove in a vault of black was the dazzling array of stars as the\ndesert lands know them; so low they were, the ragged, broken tops of\nthe three ancient craters seemed touching the warm velvet of the sky\non which the stars were hung. Beyond their smooth slopes a spreading\nglow gave promise of the rising moon.\n\nRawson headed the car downgrade in readiness for a quick return; he\nran it close to the inner wall of rock out of which the road had been\ncarved, then seated himself on the outer rim without thought of the\nthousand-foot sheer drop beneath his dangling legs. With a glass he\nwas sweeping the foreground where the scattered lights of the camp\nwere like vagrant reflections of the stars thrown back to them from\nthe dead sea of sand.\n\n\"Riley's on the job,\" he told Smithy when he passed over the glass\nlater on. \"And I've got my pocket portable.\" He took the little radio\nreceiver from his pocket as he spoke. \"Riley will signal me from my\noffice if he sees anything.\"\n\nThe moon had cleared the mountains; its flood of light poured across\ntheir rugged heights and filled the bowl of Tonah Basin as some master\nof a great theatrical switchboard might have flooded a dark stage with\nmagic illumination, half concealing, transforming whatever things it\ntouched.\n\nAll the hard brilliance of sunlit sands was gone. The rolling dunes\nwere softly mellow; the more distant mountains were dream-peaks. Half\nreal, they seemed, and half imagined in a veil of haze. Even the\nbuildings, the scattered piles of material, the gaunt skeleton of the\nderrick--their stark blackness of outline and clear-cut shadow were\ngone; the whole land was drenched in the mystery and magic of a desert\nmoon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRawson and the man beside him were silent. Even a mind perplexed by\nunanswerable problems must pause before the witchery of nature's\nsofter moods.\n\n\"If Riley were here,\" said Smithy softly at last, \"he wouldn't be\nseeing any devils. Fairies, pixies, the 'little people'--he'd be\nseeing them dancing.\"\n\nRawson shot his companion a sidelong, appraising glance. He had never\npenetrated before to this sub-stratum of Smithy's nature. He had\nnever, in fact, felt that he knew much about Smithy, whose past was\nstill the one topic that was never mentioned. He saw his thick mop of\nblack hair and the profile of his face as Smithy stared fixedly down\ntoward the sleeping camp. It was a matter of a minute or so before he\nknew that the head was outlined against an aura of red light.\n\nSmithy was seated at his right. Off beyond him the three extinct\ncraters made a dark background where the moonlight had not yet reached\nto their inner slopes. Smithy's head was directly in line with the\nlargest crater's irregularly broken top; and about it was the faintest\ntinge of red.\n\nFor a moment the light flamed close; it seemed to be hovering about\nthe head of the silent, seated man. Then Rawson moved, looked past,\nand found a true perspective for the phenomenon. One rugged cleft in\nthe rim of the crater's cup made a peephole for seeing within. It was\nplainly red--the light came from inside the age-old throat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It's alive!\" Rawson whispered in quick consternation. Almost he\nexpected to see billowing clouds of smoke, the fearful pyrotechnics of\nvolcanic eruption.\n\nHe sensed more than saw that Smithy had not turned his head. \"Look!\"\nhe was shouting by now. \"Wake up, Smithy! Good Lord!\"\n\nHe stopped, open-mouthed. The red glow had meant volcanic fires; to\nhave it change abruptly to a green radiance was disconcerting.\n\nGreen--pale green. Only through the gap, like a space where a tooth\nwas missing in the giant jaw, could Dean Rawson see the changed light.\nOnly from this one point could the view be had--there would be nothing\nvisible from the camp below. And as quickly as it had come all\nthought of volcanic fires left him; he knew with quick certainty that\nthis was something that concerned him, that threatened, and that was\nlinked up with the other threatening, mysterious happenings of the\nrecent nights and days.\n\nStill Smithy had not turned. Rawson felt one quick flash of annoyance\nat his helper's dullness--or indifference; then he knew that Smithy's\ndark-haired head was reached forward, that he was bending at a\nprecarious angle to stare below him into the valley. Then:\n\n\"They're there!\" said Smithy in a hushed voice, as if someone or\nsomething on that desert floor far below might hear and take alarm.\n\"Look, Dean. Where's your glass? What are they?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis cautious whispering was unnecessary. Below them a thin line of\nlight pierced the darkness; another; then three more in quick\nsuccession before the sharp crack of pistol fire came to the men a\nthousand feet above. Rawson had snatched up his binoculars.\n\n\"To the left,\" Smithy was directing. \"Off there, by the big casting.\nGreat Scott! what's that light?\"\n\nRawson got it in the glass--a single flash of green that cut the\nblackness with an almost audible hiss. It was gone in an instant while\na man's voice screamed once in fear and agony, one scream that broke\nlike brittle steel in the same instant that it began.\n\nDean found the big casting in the circle of his glass. There were\nblack figures moving near it; they were indistinct. He changed the\nfocus--they were gone before he could get their images sharp.\n\nBut the casting! Plainly he saw its great bulk that many men had\nworked to ease down to the sand. It was outlined clearly now until its\nedge became a blur, until the sand rolled in upon it, and its black\nmass became a circle that shrank and shrank and vanished utterly at\nthe last.\n\n\"It's gone!\" Rawson shouted. \"It sank into the sand! I saw it....\"\n\nHe was running for the car. A clamor of voices was coming from below;\nthe sound died under the thunder of the car's exhaust as Rawson gave\nit the gun and sent the big machine leaping toward the waiting curves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_The Attack_\n\n\nEvery light of the camp was on as Rawson and his assistant approached.\nA shallow depression in the sand marked the place where the big\ncasting had been. Beyond it a hundred feet was a black swarm of men\nthat parted as the car drew near. They had been gathered about a\nfigure upon the sand.\n\nDean sensed something peculiar about that figure as the big car\nploughed to a stop. He leaped out and ran forward.\n\nHe knew it was Riley there on the ground, knew it while still he was a\nscore of feet away. Only when he was close, however, did he realize\nthat the body ended in two stubs of legs; only when he leaned above\nhim did he know that the Irish foreman's big frame had been cut in two\nas if by a knife.\n\nThe severed legs lay a short distance beyond the body; they had fallen\nside by side in horrible awkwardness, their stumps of flesh protruding\nfrom charred clothing--and suddenly, shockingly, Rawson knew that the\nflesh of body and legs had been seared. The knife had been hot--its\nblade had been forged of flame!\n\nHe heard Smithy cursing softly, unconsciously, at his side.\n\n\"The green light,\" Smithy was saying in horrified understanding. \"But\nwho did it? How did they do it? Where did they go?\"\n\n\"Quiet!\" ordered Rawson sharply. He dropped to his knees beside the\nmutilated body. Riley's eyes had opened in a sudden movement of\nconsciousness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe voice that came from his lips was a ghastly whisper at first, but\nin that stricken thing that had been the body of Riley, foreman of the\nnight drilling crew, some reservoir of strength must still have\nremained untapped.\n\nHe drew upon it now. His voice roared again as it had done so many\ntimes before through the Tonah Basin camp. It reached to every\nlistening ear where crowding men stood hushed and motionless; and the\novertone of terror that altered its customary timber was apparent to\nall.\n\n\"Devils!\" said Riley. \"Devils, straight out o' hell!... I saw 'em--I\nsaw 'em plain!... I shot--as if hot lead could harm the imps of\nSatan....\n\n\"Oh, sir,\"--his eyes had found those of Dean Rawson who was leaning\nabove--\"for the love of hivin, Mister Rawson, do ye be quittin'\ndrillin'. The place is damned. L'ave it, sir; go away....\"\n\nHis eyes closed. But he started up once more; he raised his head from\nthe sand with one final convulsive movement, and his voice was high\nand shrill.\n\n\"The fire! The fire of hell! He's turnin' it on me! God help....\"\n\nBut Riley, before his failing mind could recall again that torturing\njet of flame, must have slipped away into a darkness as softly\nenveloping as the velvet shadow world behind the low-hung stars.\nRawson's hand that felt for a moment above the heart, confirmed the\nmessage of the closed eyes and the head that fell inertly back.\n\nHe came slowly to his feet.\n\n\"Keep the floods on!\" he ordered. \"Take command of the armed guard,\nSmithy; keep the whole camp patrolled.\"\n\nThen to the men:\n\n\"Boys, Riley was wrong. He believed what he said, all right, but Smith\nand I know better. Don't worry about devils. These're just some dirty,\nskulking dogs who got away with murder this time but who won't do it\nagain. We know where they're hiding. I'm checking up on them right\nnow. After that you'll all get a chance to square accounts for poor\nold Riley!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But the casting!\" Smithy protested when he and Rawson were alone.\n\"You can't explain that disappearance so easy, Dean.\"\n\n\"No, I can't explain that,\" Rawson's words came slowly. \"They've got\nsomething that we don't understand as yet--but I'm going to know the\nanswer, and I'm going to find out to-night!\"\n\nHe was seated behind the wheel of his old car.\n\n\"I'm as good a desert man as there is in this crowd,\" he told Smith.\n\"And it's my fight, you know. I'm going alone. But there'll be no\nfighting this trip; I'll just be scouting around.\"\n\nHe leaned from the car to grip Smithy's shoulder with a hand firm and\nsteady.\n\n\"You didn't see the crater when the show was on. You think that I'm\ncrazy to believe it, but up in that crater is where I'll find the\nanswer to a lot of questions. Lord knows what that answer will be.\nI've quit trying to guess. I'm just going up there to find out.\"\n\nHe was gone, the rear wheels of the car throwing a spray of sand as he\nstarted heedless of Smithy's protests against the plan. Rawson was in\nno mood to argue. He must climb the mountain while it was night; under\nthe sun he would never reach the top alive. He would go alone and\nunseen.\n\nHe swung wide of the deserted town at the mountain's base. The\nspectral walls of Little Rhyolite still showed their empty windows\nthat stared like dead eyes, and the man guided his car without lights\nalong a hidden stretch of hard, salt-crusted desert. He felt certain\nthat other eyes were watching.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe began his climb at a point five miles away. The slopes that seemed\nsmooth and hard from a distance became, at closer range, a place of\nwind-heaped, sandy ash, carved and scoured into fantastic forms. But\nits very roughness offered protection, and Rawson fought the dragging\nsand, and the gray, choking ash that dried his throat and cut it like\nemery, without fear of being observed.\n\nHe fought against time, too. Above Little Rhyolite, whatever\nmysterious men were making the ascent would find the going easy. There\nwere windswept areas, long fields of pumice; a man could make good\ntime there. Rawson had none of these to aid him. He cast anxious\nglances toward the eastern sky as he struggled on, till he saw gray\nlight change to rose and gold--but he stood in the titanic cleft in\nthe crater's rim as the first straight rays of the sun struck across.\n\nThe volcano's top had been stripped clean by the winds of countless\nyears. Rocks, black, brown, even blood-red, were naked to the pitiless\nglare of the sun. Their colors were mingled in a weird fantasy of\ntwisted lines that told of the inferno of heat in which they had been\nformed.\n\nThey towered high above the head of Dean Rawson as he stood, panting\nand trembling with exhaustion. The cleft before him had become\nenormous: it was a canyon, half filled with pumice and coarse ash.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRawson stood for long minutes in quiet listening. At the canyon's end\nwould lie the crater, and in that crater he would find.... But there\nwas no slightest picture in his mind of what he might see. He knew\nonly that he himself must remain unseen. He went forward cautiously.\n\nRocky walls; a floor of sand where his feet left no mark. He was\nwatching ahead and above him. His gun was ready in his hand; he did\nnot propose to be ambushed. He moved with never a sound.\n\nThe silence persisted; no living thing other than himself lent any\nflicker of motion to the scene. Not even a lizard could hope for\nexistence amid these dead and barren heights. He was alone--the\ncertainty of it had driven deeply into his mind before the canyon end\nwas reached. And, desert man though he was and accustomed to traveling\nthe waste places of the earth, Rawson learned a new meaning and depth\nof solitude.\n\nHere was no voiceless companionship of trees or brush or cactus; no\nlittle living things scuttled across the rocks--he was alone, the only\nspeck of life in a place where life seemed forbidden.\n\nSo sure of this was he that he stepped boldly from the canyon's end.\nHe knew before he looked that he would see only more of the same\ndesolation. And his mind was filled equally with anger and\ndisappointment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomething was opposing him! Something had come into their camp--had\nkilled old Riley. And he, Rawson, had been so sure he would find\ntraces here that would allow him to give that opposing force a\nname....\n\nHe stared out from the rocky cleft into a sun-blasted pit. Already\nthe rising sun was pouring its energy ever the jagged rim of bleak\nrocks and down into the vast throat, choked and filled with ash.\n\nIt sloped gently from all sides, the gray-brown powder that had been\ncoughed from within the earth. It made a floor where Rawson could have\nwalked with safety. But he did not go on.\n\n\"Damn it!\" he said with sudden savagery. \"What a fool I was to think\nof finding anyone here. Who would ever pick out a spot like this for a\nbase of operations?\"\n\nHe stared angrily at the floor of ash, at the black, outcropping\nmasses of tufa. He was angry with himself, angry and baffled and tired\nfrom his climb. Far down in the vast, shallow pit blazing sunlight\nglinted from massive blocks whose sides were mirror-smooth. A whirl of\nwind eddied there for a moment and lifted the dust into a vertical\ngray column--the only sign of motion in the whole desolate scene.\nRawson turned and tramped back toward the long hot descent to the\nfloor of the Basin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe tried to maintain an air of confidence before the men. He kept them\nbusy placing and stacking materials; to all appearances the work would\ngo on despite the mysterious happenings of the night.\n\nDean even prepared to resume drilling operations. He sent down another\nbailer on the end of the ten-mile cable, but he left it there; he did\nnot care to raise it and risk more inexplicable results with the\nconsequent destruction of the men's morale.\n\n\"Too late to do any more,\" he said to Smithy that afternoon. \"We'll\ndrop all work--let the men get a good night's sleep. I'll take guard\nduty to-night, and you can run the job to-morrow.\"\n\nThere were men of the drilling crew standing near, though Rawson was\nhandling the hoisting drums himself. A ratchet release lever hooked\nits end under a ring on Rawson's hand and pinched the flesh. Dean made\nthis an excuse for waiting a moment while the drillers walked away.\n\n\"Ought not to wear it, I suppose,\" he said, and dabbed at a spot of\nblood under the gold band. \"But it's an old cameo--it belonged to my\nDad.\"\n\nHe was showing the ring to Smithy as the men passed from hearing.\n\n\"Don't want to be seen talking,\" he explained tersely. \"Mustn't let\nthe men know we are on edge--they're about ready to bolt. But you be\nready for a call. Have your men armed. I am looking for more trouble\nto-night.\"\n\nThe two were laughing loudly as they followed the men toward the\nbuilding where the cook was banging on an iron tire that served as a\nbell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome three hours later Rawson was not smiling as he climbed the steel\nladder of the great derrick; he was grimly intent upon the job at\nhand.\n\nAll thought of his drilling operations had gone from him. He was not\nanxious about the project. This was merely an interruption; the work\nwould go on later. But right now there was an enemy to be met and a\nmystery to be solved.\n\nA rifle slung from his shoulder bumped against him satisfyingly as he\nclimbed. A man was on duty at a master switch--he would flood the camp\nwith light at the rifle's first crack.\n\nDean seated himself at the top of the derrick. The cylinder of a huge\nfloodlight was beside him. Beyond was the massive sheave block; the\ncables ran dizzily down to the concrete drilling floor so far below.\nAnd on every side the quiet camp spread out dark and silent in the\nnight. Dean surveyed it all with satisfaction. Nothing would get by\nhim now.\n\nBut his further reflections were not so satisfying.\n\n\"Who did it? How? Where did they go?\" He was echoing Smithy's\nquestions and finding no ready answers. And that flame-thrower that\nhad cut down old Riley--how was that worked? Its one green flash had\nbeen almost instantaneous.\n\nHe was puzzling over such futile questioning when he saw the first\nsign of attack.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the foot of the derrick was the hoisting shed. Except for that,\nthere was clear sand for a radius of fifty feet around the derrick's\nbase. Dean was staring suspiciously at that open space almost directly\nunderneath.\n\nMoving sand! He hardly knew what he had seen at first. Then the sand\nat one point bulged upward unmistakably.\n\nFor one instant Dean's thoughts shot off at a tangent. It was like the\nwork of a huge gopher--he had seen the little animals break through\nlike that. Then the sand parted, and something, indistinct, blurred,\ndark against the yellow background, broke from cover.\n\nRawson swung the rifle's muzzle over and down. Below him the vague\nshadow had moved. Dean caught the blurred mass beyond his sights, then\nswung the weapon aside. Who was it? He would have a look first.\n\nThe thin crack of his rifle ripped the silence of the sleeping camp.\nDean had aimed to one side and he regretted it in the instant of\nfiring. For, in the same second, there had come from the moving shadow\nthe gleam of starlight reflected upward from polished metal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDean swung the rifle back. He fired quickly a second time. Beside him\nthe big light hissed into action and the whole camp sprang to sudden,\nblazing light. And through the quick brilliance, more dazzling even\nthan the white glare itself, was one blinding line of green flame.\n\nDean saw it as it began. It came from the dim shadow that had sprung\nsuddenly into sharp outline as the big lights came on. He saw the\nfigure. He sensed that it was a man, though he knew vaguely that the\nfigure was grotesque and hideous in some manner he had no time to\ndiscern.\n\nThe thin line of green flame ripped straight out, swinging in a quick,\nsweeping trajectory, slashing through the steelwork of the great\nderrick itself!\n\nDean knew he was lost in the blinding instant while that fiery jet was\nsweeping in a fan-shaped sector of vivid green. A knife of flame! It\nhad destroyed a man: it was now cutting down a framework of steel as\nwell!\n\nThe derrick was falling as he fired again. There came a crushing jar\ndownward as the metal melted and failed, and the wild outward swing in\nthe beginning of the toppling fall. In the mind of Dean Rawson was but\none thought: the sights--and a something blurred beyond--a trigger to\nbe pressed.\n\nHe was still firing when the shriek of torn steel went to thundering\nsilence, and even the lights of Tonah Basin Camp were swallowed up in\nthe whirling night....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_Into the Crater_\n\n\nSmithy's agonized face was above him when he came back to life. \"God!\"\nSmithy was breathing. \"I thought you were gone, Dean! I thought you\nwere dead!\"\n\nAs it had been with Riley, there was one thought uppermost in Rawson's\nbewildered mind: \"The fire!\" he choked. \"He's swinging it....\"\n\nThen, after a time: \"The derrick--it's falling! I went down with\nit!... I hit--\"\n\n\"I'll say you did,\" said the relieved Smithy. \"The derrick smashed\nacross the bunkhouse, snapped you off, sent you skidding down the side\nof a sand dune. It darned near scoured the clothes off you at that.\"\n\nSlowly Rawson began to feel the return flow of life through his body;\nthe shock had jarred every nerve to insensibility. Slowly he\nremembered and comprehended what had happened.\n\nHe was in his little office; he recognized his surroundings now. The\nwindows were open. Outside the sun was shining. He realized at last\nthe utter silence of that outer world.\n\nHe tried to raise himself from the cot, but fell back as his\nsurroundings began to spin. \"The camp!\" he gasped weakly. \"The men--I\ndon't hear them.\"\n\n\"Gone!\" Smith told him, while his eyes narrowed at some recollection\nand his hand came up unconsciously to a bruise of his cheek. \"They\nbeat it--went last night after the derrick fell. I tried to stop them.\nThe fools were crazy with fear--devils, hell, all that kind of stuff.\nIt all wound up in a fight--I couldn't hold 'em.\n\n\"You've got to get better kind of fast,\" he told Rawson. \"We've got to\nget out of here ourselves--that flame-throwing stuff is too strong for\nme to take.\"\n\nRawson suddenly remembered the vague figure that had directed that\nflame. \"Did I get him?\" he demanded eagerly.\n\n\"You got him, yes, but then a whole swarm of things boiled up out of\nnowhere and carried him off! We weren't any of us close enough to\nsee. The men said they were devils; I'm not sure they were wrong,\neither. Dean, old man, we're up against something rotten. We've got to\nget fixed for a fight; we can't handle this by ourselves.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRawson was silent. He spoke slowly at last:\n\n\"You mean we've got to quit--quit without knowing what we're up\nagainst. Can you imagine what they'll say to me back in town? Scared\nout, licked by something I've never even seen!\"\n\n\"Scared?\" Smithy inquired. \"You couldn't find a better word for it if\nyou hunted through the whole dictionary. Scared? Why, say, I'm so damn\nscared I'm shaking yet, and the only thing that will cure me of it is\nto look at those devils along the top of a machine gun! We'll go catch\nus some equipment and a few service men--\"\n\n\"You're a good guy, Smithy,\" Rawson reached out and gripped one brown\nhand. \"And we'll do as you say; but first I've got to get a line on\nthings. I'm becoming as irrational as the men. I'm imagining all sort\nof crazy things.\"\n\n\"You don't have to imagine them.\" Smithy's voice was strained; it\nshowed the tension under which he was laboring. \"Men or beasts--God\nknows what they are!--but when they come up from nowhere--\"\n\n\"Out of the sand,\" Rawson explained.\n\nSmithy stared at him. \"Out of the sand,\" he repeated. \"Then, when they\ncut a man in two, melt steel as if it were butter, pull a few tons of\nmetal down out of sight as easy as we would sink it in the ocean,\nflash their lights over in the ghost town, up on top of a volcano--\"\n\n\"Stop!\" shouted Rawson unexpectedly. Some sudden gleam of\nunderstanding had flashed through his mind. He dragged himself to his\nfeet and staggered to the doorway where he clung until the nausea of a\nwhirling world had passed. \"The dust! The dust!\" he gasped.\n\nSmithy put a hand on his shoulder. Plainly he thought Rawson out of\nhis mind. \"Easy, old-timer,\" he cautioned. \"We'll get out of here. I\nhate to make you walk in the shape you're in, but the dirty cowards\nran off with the trucks. They even took your car; there isn't a thing\nhere on wheels.\"\n\nBut Rawson did not hear. He was staring off across the sand, and he\nwas muttering bitter words.\n\n\"Fool! Oh, you utter fool!\" he said. \"The dust--the dust.\" Then he let\nthe roughly tender hands of Smithy guide him back to the cot where he\nfell into a troubled sleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe comparative coolness of dusk was tempering the feverish midday\nheat when Rawson awoke. And, strangely, his troubles and all his\nconflicting plans had been simplified by the magic of sleep. His\ncourse was entirely plain. He was going to the crater again.\n\n\"What's there?\" Smithy demanded. \"What do you think that you'll find?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Then why--what the devil's the idea?\"\n\n\"It's my job. They put it up to me, Erickson and his crowd. I've got\nto go.\"\n\nAnd nothing Smithy could say seemed able to reach Rawson and swerve\nhim from his single idea.\n\n\"You'll be safe on the road,\" Rawson told him, while he filled a\ncanteen with water in preparation for his own trip. \"You can get to\nthe highway by morning.\"\n\nSmithy did not trouble to reply. Was Rawson out of his mind? He could\nnot be sure. Certainly he had got an awful bump, but there were no\nbones broken. However, it might be that he was still dazed--a crack on\nthe head might have done it.\n\nBut there was no use in further argument, he admitted to himself. Dean\nwas going to the crater again--there was no stopping him--but he was\nnot going alone; Smithy could see to that.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain Rawson took the more difficult ascent. They went first to the\nghost town: the slope above Little Rhyolite would save weary miles.\nBut, once there, they knew that the route was not a place where they\nwould care to be in the night. The realization came when Smithy,\nwalking where they had been the day before, passing the sand dune\nwhere the wind had been scouring, seized Rawson's arm.\n\n\"I thought so,\" he said softly. \"I thought I saw something there the\nother day, but the sand fell in and hid it. I didn't know the\nold-timers went in for subways in Little Rhyolite.\"\n\nAnd Rawson looked as did Smithy, in wondering amazement, at the\nroughly round opening in the sand, a tunnel mouth, driven through the\nshifting sands--a tunnel, if Rawson was any judge, lined with brown\nglistening glass.\n\nUnderstanding came quickly.\n\n\"The jet of flame!\" he exclaimed half under his breath. \"They melted\ntheir way through; the sand turned to glass; they held it some way for\nan instant while it hardened.\" He walked cautiously toward the dark\nentrance and peered inside.\n\nDarkness but for the nearer glinting reflections from walls that had\nonce been molten and dripping. The tunnel dipped down at a slight\nangle, then straightened off horizontally. Rawson could have stood\nupright in it with easily another two feet of headroom to spare.\n\n\"And that,\" said Smithy, \"is how the dirty rats got over to the camp.\nLike moles in their runway. No wonder they could pop up from nowhere.\nBut, Dean, old man, I'm thinkin' we're up against something we haven't\ndared speak of to each other. Don't tell me that it's just men we've\ngot to meet--\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Rawson begged in a hushed whisper. \"Wait till we know. That's\nwhy I didn't dare go out without something definite to report. We'll\ngo up--but not here. We'll get a line on this up top.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe led the way from the crumbling walls and skirted the mountain's\nbase to the place where he had climbed before. And, with the help of a\nsupporting arm at times, he found himself again in the great cleft in\nthe rocks.\n\nDarkness now made the passageway a place of somber shadows. The broad\ncupped crater lay beyond in silent waiting; the vast sand-filled pit\nseemed, under the starlight, to have been only that instant cooled.\nThe twisted rocks that formed the rim had been caught in the very\ninstant of their tortures and frozen to deep silence and eternal\ndeath: the black masses of tufa, protruding from the packed ashy sand\nmight have been buried by the smothering mass but a moment before. It\nwas a place of death, a place where nothing moved--until again the\nbreeze that whirled gustily over the saw-tooth crags snatched at the\nsand in that lowest pit and drew it up in a spiral of dust.\n\nThe word was on Rawson's lips. \"Dust--dust in the crater. Fool! I said\nI could read sign; I thought I was a desert man.\"\n\n\"Dust? And why shouldn't there be dust? How do you usually have your\nvolcanoes arranged, old man?\"\n\n\"Fine dust!\" Rawson interrupted in the same whisper. He was glancing\nsharply about him as if in fear of being overheard. \"See, the wind is\nblowing it. Coarse sand and pumice--that's to be expected; but light\ndust in a place that the winds have been sweeping for the last million\nyears! I don't have them arranged that way, Smithy--not unless the\nsand has been recently disturbed!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe moved soundlessly across the sand. There was no chance for\nconcealment; the surface was too smooth for that. Yet he wished, as he\nmoved onward down the long, gentle slope, that he had been able to\nkeep under cover. In all the wide bowl of the great crater top was\nnothing but dead ashes of fires gone long centuries before, coarse,\nigneous rock--nothing to set the little nerves of one's spine to\ntingling. Rawson tried to tell himself he was alone. Even the gun in\nhis hand seemed an absurd precaution. Yet he knew, with a certainty\nthat went beyond mere seeing, that invisible eyes were upon him.\n\nThe blocks were massive when he drew near to them. They were buried in\nthe sand, their sides like mirrors, their edges true and straight.\n\"Crystals,\" Rawson tried to tell himself, but he knew they were not.\n\nGun in hand, he moved among the great rocks. Open sand lay beyond,\nrunning off at a steeper pitch to make a throat--a smaller pit in the\ngreat pit of the crater itself. Rawson noted it, then forgot it as he\nstooped for something that lay half hidden, its protruding end shining\nunder the light of the stars, as he had seen it gleam before at the\nderrick's base.\n\nHe snatched up the metal tube, noting the lava tip, and that it was\nlike the one Smithy had found in the ghost town. The tube, clearly,\nwas part of some other mechanism, and Rawson realized with startling\nsuddenness that he was holding in his hand the jet of a\nflame-thrower--the same one, perhaps, that had almost sent him to his\ndeath.\n\nThe thought, while he was still thinking it, was blotted from his\nmind. He was thrown suddenly to the sandy earth; the sand was slipping\nswiftly from beneath his feet; he was scrambling on all fours, clawing\nwildly for some anchorage that would keep him from being swept away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe touched a corner of shining stone, drew himself to it, reached its\nslanting side, then scrambled frenziedly to the top and threw himself\nabout to face the place of slipping sands. But where the sand had\nbeen, his wildly glaring eyes found only a black hole--a vertical\nbore, like the ancient throat of the volcano; and this, like the\ntunnel in the sand, was lined with smooth and glistening glass.\n\nIt was black at first, a yawning, ominous maw, till the polished sides\ncaught a reflection from below and blazed red with the glare of hidden\nfires.\n\nNo time was needed for Dean's quick searching eyes to grasp the\nmeaning of the change. Whatever had menaced the camp had set this\ntrap. He swung sharply to leap from the block, but stopped at the\nsight of Smith's chunky figure coming slowly across the sand.\n\n\"Back!\" he shouted. His voice was almost a scream, shrill and\ncrackling with excitement. \"Get back, Smithy! I'm coming!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe would have leaped. Below the block the sand bulged upward as a\nyellow animal-thing came clawing up into the night. Dimly he saw\nit--saw this one and the others that must have been hidden in the\nsand. They were between him and Smithy! A blaze of red came from\nbehind him--there must be others there! He snatched his gun from its\nholster as he turned.\n\nFlames were hissing into the darkness, five or six of them in lines of\nhot crimson fire. They changed to green as he watched, and the livid\nlight spread out in ghastly illumination over the creatures that\ndirected them.\n\nHe saw them now--saw them in one age-long instant while he stood in\nhorror on the black shining rock. He saw their heads, red-skinned,\npointed, their staring eyes as large as saucers--owl-eyes. They were\nnaked, and their bodies, that would have been almost crimson in the\nlight of day, were blotched and ghastly in the green light. And each\none held in long clawlike hands a thing of shining metal--a lava tip\nlike the one he had found projected and ended in the hissing line of\ngreen.\n\nA flame slashed downward. For one sickening second he waited to feel\nthe heat of it, though it was many feet away; in his mind he cringed\ninvoluntarily from the ripping knife-cut of the fiery blade that would\nblast the life from him; then he knew that the flame had passed--it\nwas tearing at the rock beneath his feet. And the cold stone turned to\nliquid fire at that touch.\n\nIt leaped in a splashing fountain to the sand. The blaze turned the\nwhole pit to flame. On even the farthest rugged crag of the crater's\nrim the red light glowed. Before Rawson could raise his own weapon the\nblast had torn the rock from beneath his feet. The great mass tipped,\nrolled. Rawson's arms were flung wide in an effort to save himself.\nThen below him was the black throat with its walls of glass: he was\nplunging headlong into it, turning as he fell--and somewhere, far down\nin that throat, was the red glow of waiting fires. He saw it again and\nagain as he fell....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_The Ring_\n\n[Illustration: _One of them pointed at the shaft Rawson had drilled._]\n\n[Sidenote: Town after town is fired by the emerging Red Ones as Rawson\nlies helpless, a prisoner, far down in their home within the earth.]\n\n\n\"Smithy,\" Rawson had called him when he found the youngster fighting\ngamely with death in the heat of Tonah Basin. And Gordon Smith was the\nname on the company records. Yet he remained always \"Smithy\" to\nRawson, and the name, which Rawson never ceased to believe was\nassumed, became a mark of the affection which can spring up between\nman and man.\n\nAnd now Smithy stood like a rigid carven statue in the midst of a\nbarren sandy waste in the vast cup of a towering volcano top--sand\nthat was in reality coarse pumice and ash. This was a place of death,\na place where raging fires had left nothing for plant or animal life.\nAnd, over all, the desert stars shone down coldly and added to the\ndesolation with their own pale light.\n\nSmithy had seen Rawson pull himself to the top of the great\nsquare-edged rock. Sensing that danger of some sort was threatening,\nhe had started to run to the aid of the struggling man. Then came\nRawson's cry.\n\n\"Back!\" he shouted. \"Get back, Smithy! I'm coming--\"\n\nBut he did not come; and Smithy, halted by the command, was frozen to\nsudden, panic-stricken immobility by that which followed.\n\nHe saw the leaping things, like grotesque yellow giants. They came\nfrom the sand; then red ones leaped up from the open throat that had\nsuddenly formed. They held flame throwers, the red ones; and the green\nlines of fire melted the rock from beneath Rawson's feet. All in the\none second's time, it was done, and Rawson's body, his arms wide\nflung, was hurtling downward into the waiting throat and the\nthreatening red glow from within. Then the carriers of the flame\nthrowers vanished again into the pit, and there was left only a huddle\nof giant figures that tore at the loose sand and ash with their hands.\n\nThey threw the material in a continuous stream; the air was full of\ncascading sand. To Smithy they were suddenly inhuman--they were almost\nanimals; men like moles. And they and their companions had captured\nDean Rawson--sent him to his death. Slowly the watching man raised\nhimself from the crouched position that had kept him hidden.\n\nThey were through with their work, these great yellow-skinned naked\nmen--or mole-men. Six of them--Smithy counted them slowly before he\ntook aim--and two were armed with flame-throwers.\n\nSmithy rested his arm across the little hummock of gritty ash that\nhad sheltered him and sent six flashes of flame through the night\ntoward the cluster of bodies.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe made no attempt to aim at each individual--the shapes were too\nshadowy for that. And he had no knowledge of what other weapons they\nmight have. One thing was sure: he must take no chances on facing the\nred ones single-handed. He rammed his empty pistol back into its\nholster as he turned and ran--ran with every ounce of energy he\npossessed to drive his flying feet across the crater floor, out\nthrough the cleft in the rocks and down the steep mountainside.\n\nHe was stunned by the suddenness of the catastrophe that had overtaken\nthem. The horror of Dean Rawson's going; the fearful reality of those\n\"devils from hell\" that old Riley had seen--it was all too staggering,\ntoo numbing, for easy acceptance. Time was required for the truth to\nsink in; and through the balance of the night Smithy had plenty of\ntime to think.\n\nHe dared not go back to the camp where ripping flashes of green light\ntold him the enemy was at work. And then, even had it been possible to\ncreep up on them in the darkness, that one chance vanished as the\ndesert about the camp sprang into view. One after another the\nbuildings burst into flame, and Smithy was thankful for the\nconcealment of the vast, empty desert.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe embers were still glowing when he dared go near. This enemy, it\nseemed, worked only at night, and Smithy waited only for the sun to\nshow above distant purple ranges. It had been their enemy once, that\nfiercely hot sun; they had fought against the heat--but never had the\nsun wrought such destruction as this.\n\nSmithy looked from haggard, hopeless eyes upon the wreckage of\nRawson's camp. For the men who had worked there, this had meant only a\njob; to Smithy it had been a fight against the desert which had\ndefeated him once. But to Rawson it meant the fruit of years of\neffort, the goal of his dreams brought almost within his reach.\n\nSmithy looked at the smoldering heaps of gray where an idle wind\npuffed playfully at fluffy ash or fanned a bed of coals to flame.\nTwisted steel of the wrecked derrick was still further distorted; the\nenemy had ripped it to pieces with his stabbing flames. Even the\nunused materials, the steel and cement that had been neatly stacked\nfor future use--the flames had been turned on it all.\n\nAnd Smithy, though his voice broke almost boyishly from his repressed\nemotion, spoke aloud in solemn promise:\n\n\"It's too late to help you, Dean. I'll go back to town, report to the\nmen who were back of you, and then.... They're going to pay, Dean!\nWhoever--whatever--they are, they're going to pay!\"\n\nHe turned away toward the mountains and the ribbon of road that wound\noff toward the canyon. Then, at some recollection, he swung back.\n\n\"The cable's still down--he would have wanted it left all shipshape,\"\nhe whispered.\n\nWhere the derrick had stood was the mouth of the twenty-inch casing.\nThe cable that ran from it was entangled with the wreckage of the\nderrick, but it had not been cut. Smithy set doggedly to work.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA little gin-pole and light tackle allowed him to erect a heavier\ntripod of steel beams; it hoisted the big sheave block into place, and\ngave Smithy's two hands the strength of twenty to rig a temporary\nhoist. The juice was still on the main feed line, and the hoisting\nmotors hummed at his touch. The ten miles of cable wound slowly onto\nthe drums.\n\n\"It's nonsense, I suppose,\" he told himself silently. But something\ndrove him to do this last thing--to leave it all as Rawson would have\nhad it.\n\nThe long bailer came out at last; there was just room to hoist it\nclear and let it drop back upon the drilling floor. A glint of gold\nflashed in the sunlight as Smithy let the long metal tube down, and he\nbroke into voluble cursing at sight of the bit of metal that was\ncaught near the bailer's top.\n\nThe gold had started it all! That first finding of the gold on the big\ndrill had begun it.... He crossed swiftly to the gleaming thing that\nseemed somehow to symbolize his loss.\n\nHe stooped to reach for it, intending to throw it as far as he could.\nInstead he stood in an awkward stooping attitude--stood so while the\nlong uncounted minutes passed....\n\nHis eyes that stared and stared in disbelief seemed suddenly to have\nturned traitor. They were telling him that they saw a ring--a\ncameo--jammed solidly into the shackle at the bailer's end. And that\nring, when last he had seen it, had been on Dean Rawson's hand! Dean\nhad caught it; he had hooked it over a lever in this very place--and\nnow, from ten miles down inside the solid earth, it had returned. It\nmeant--it meant....\n\nBut the stocky, broad-shouldered youngster known as Smithy dared not\nthink what it meant. Nor had he time to follow the thought; he was too\nbusily engaged in running at suicidal speed across the hot sand toward\nbarren mountains where a ribbon of road showed through quivering air.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_The Darkness_\n\n\nDarkness; and red fires that seemed whirling about him as his body\ntwisted in air. To Dean Rawson, plunging down into the volcano's maw,\neach second was an eternity, for, in each single instant, he was\nexpecting crashing death.\n\nThen he knew that long arms were wrapped about him, holding him,\nsupporting him, checking his downward plunge ... and at last the\nglassy walls, where each bulbous irregularity shone red with reflected\nlight, moved slowly past. And, after more eons of time, a rocky floor\nrose slowly to meet him.\n\nHis body crashed gently; he was sprawled face downward on stone that\nwas smooth and cold. The restraining arms no longer touched him.\n\nHe lay motionless for some time, his mind as stunned and\nuncomprehending as if he had truly crashed to death upon that rocky\nfloor. Then, at last, he forced his reluctant nerves and muscles to\nturn his body till he lay face upward.\n\nDarkness wrapped him as if it were the soft swathing of some black\ncocoon. The world about him was at first a place of utter night-time\nblackness; and then, far above him, there shone a single star ...\nuntil that feeble candle-gleam, too, was snuffed out.\n\nA hand was gripping his shoulder; it seemed urging him to arise. He\nfelt each separate finger--long, slender, like bands of steel. The\nnail at each finger-end was more nearly a claw, the whole hand a thin,\nclutching thing like the foot of some giant ape. And, even as he\nshrank involuntarily from that touch, Rawson wondered how the creature\ncould reach out and grip him so surely in the dark. But he came to\nhis feet in response to that urging hand.\n\nThe night was suddenly sibilant with eery, whistling voices. They came\nfrom all sides at once; they threw themselves back and forth in\nendless echoes. To Rawson it was only a confused medley of conflicting\nsounds in which no one voice was clear. But the creature that held him\nmust have understood, for he heard him reply in a sharp, piercing\ntone, half whistle, half shriek.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat had happened? Where was he? What was this thing that pushed him,\nstumbling, along through the dark? With all his tumultuous questioning\nhe knew only one thing definitely: that it would be of no use to\nstruggle. He was as helpless as any trapped animal.\n\nHe was inside the earth, of course; he had fallen he had no least idea\nhow far; and, in some strange manner, this long-armed thing had\nsupported him and eased him gently down. But what it meant or what lay\nahead were matters too obscure for him to try to see clearly.\n\nHe held his hands protectingly before him while the talons gripping\ninto his shoulder hurried him along. He stumbled awkwardly as his foot\nstruck an obstruction. He would have fallen but for the grip that held\nhim erect.\n\nFor that creature, whatever it was, the darkness held no uncertainty.\nHe moved swiftly. His shrill shriek and the jerk of his arm both gave\nevidence of his astonishment that his captive should walk so\nblunderingly.\n\nThen it seemed that he must have comprehended Rawson's blindness. A\ngreen line of light passed close behind Dean's head. It was\ncold--there was no radiant warmth--but, when it struck the face of a\nwall of stone some twenty feet away, the solid rock turned instantly\nto a mass of glowing yellow-red.\n\nThe cold green ray swung back and forth, leaving a path of radiant\nrock behind it wherever it touched. And the rock was hot! Once the\ngreen light held more than an instant in one place, and the rock\nsoftened at its touch, then splashed and trickled down to make a fiery\npool.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbruptly Rawson was able to see his surroundings. Also, he knew the\nsource of the red glow that had seemed like volcanic fires. There had\nbeen others like his captor; they had been down below, and had played\ntheir flames upon the rocks deep in the volcano. It was thus that they\nmade light.\n\nWith equal suddenness, and with terrible clearness, Dean found the\nanswer to one of his questions. He wrenched himself about to stare\nbehind him at the creature that held him in its grip. And, for the\nfirst time, the wild experience became something more than an\nunbelievable nightmare; in that one horrifying instant he knew it was\ntrue.\n\nOnly a few minutes before, he had been walking across the cindery sand\nof the crater top, walking under the stars and the dark desert\nsky--Dean Rawson, mining engineer, in a sane, believable world. And\nnow...!\n\nHe squinted his eyes in the dim light to see more plainly the beastly\nfigure, more horrible for being so nearly human. He had seen them\nbriefly up above; the closer view of this one specimen of a strange\nrace was no more pleasing. For now he saw clearly the cruelty in the\nface. It was there unmistakably, even though the face itself, under\nless threatening circumstances, might have been a ludicrous caricature\nof a man's.\n\nRed and nearly naked, the creature stood upright, straps of metal\nabout its body. It was about Rawson's height; its round, staring eyes\nwere about level with his own, and each eye was centered in a circular\ndisk of whitish skin. The light went dim for a moment, and Dean,\nstaring in his turn, saw those other huge eyes enlarge, the white\ncovering of each drawing back like an expanding iris.\n\nSome vague understanding came to him of the beast's ability to see in\nthe dark. They used these red-hot stones for illumination, but this\nthing had seemed to see clearly even when the stones had ceased to\nglow. And again, though indistinctly, Dean knew that those eyes might\nbe sensitive to infra-red radiations--they might see plainly by the\ndark light that continued to flood these rocky chambers, though, to\nhim, the rocks had gone lightless and black.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEven as the quick thoughts flashed through his mind, he was thinking\nother thoughts, recording other observations.\n\nThe rest of the face was red like the body; the head was sharply\npointed, and crowned with a mass of thin, clinging locks of hair. The\nmouth, a round, lipless orifice, contracted or dilated at will; from\nit came whistling words.\n\nOut of the darkness, giant things were leaping. They clutched at\nRawson, while the first captor released his hold and drew back.\nTaller, these newcomers were, bigger, and different.\n\nIn the red light from the hot rocks Dean saw their faces, in which\nwere owl eyes like those of the first one, but yellow, expressionless\nand stupid. Their great bodies were yellow: their outstretched hands\nwere webbed.\n\nFor one instant, as Rawson's hand touched his pistol in its holster,\na surge of fighting rage swept through him. His whole being was in a\nspasm of revolt against all this series of happenings that had trapped\nhim; he wanted to lash out regardless of consequences. Then cooler\njudgment came to his aid.\n\nOther figures, with faces red and ugly, expressive of nameless evil,\nwere gathered beside the one who still played the jet of cold fire\nupon the walls. Like him they were naked save for a cloth at the waist\nand the metal straps encircling their bodies. They, too, had\nflame-throwers--he saw the long metal jets and their lava tips. Yet\nthe temptation to fire into that group as fast as he could pull\ntrigger was strong upon him.\n\nInstead he allowed these other giant things to grip him with their\nwebbed hands and lead him away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe wavering light had shown many passages through the rock. Glazed,\nall of them. Either they had been blown through molten rock which had\nthen solidified to give the glassy surfaces, or else--and this seemed\nmore likely--the flame-throwers had done it. Rawson, scanning the\nlabyrinth for some recognizable strata, had a quick vision of these\ncaverns being cut out and enlarged, and of their walls melted just as\nthey were being melted now--melted and hardened again innumerable\ntimes by succeeding generations of red and yellow-skinned men.\n\nYes, they were men. He admitted this while he walked unresistingly\nbetween two of the giants. Another went before them and lighted the\nway with the green ray of a flame-thrower on the melting rock. These\nwere men--men of a different sort. Evolution, working strange changes\nunderground, had made them half beasts, diggers in the dark, mole-men!\n\nThey were passing through a long tunnel that went steadily down.\nCross passages loomed blackly; ahead of them the leader was throwing\nhis flame upon the walls of a great vault.\n\nRawson had ceased to take note of their movements. What use to\nremember? He could never escape, never retrace his steps.\n\nHe tried to whip up a faint flicker of hope at thought of Smithy.\nSmithy had seen him go, had seen the red mole-men, of course. And he\nhad got away--he must have got away! He would go for help....\n\nBut, at that, he groaned inwardly. Smithy would go for help, and then\nwhat? He would be laughed out of any sheriff's office; he would be\nlocked up as insane if he persisted. Why should he persist--for that\nmatter, why should he go at all? Smithy would not believe for a single\nminute that Rawson was still alive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis thoughts ended. Webbed hands, wrapped tightly about his arms, were\nthrusting him forward into a great room. The green flame had been\nsnapped off. One last hot circle on the high wall showed only a dull\nred. But before it faded, Dean saw dimly the outlines of a tremendous\ncavern. He saw also that these walls were unglazed, raw; they had\nnever been melted.\n\nBelow the rough and shattered sides heaps of fragments were piled\nabout the room.\n\nFleetingly he saw the shadowed details; then darkness swallowed even\nthat little he had seen. Clanging metal told of a closing door; a line\nof red outlined it for an instant to show where it was welded fast. He\nwas a prisoner in a cell whose walls were the living rock.\n\nFor a long time he stood motionless, while the heavy darkness pressed\nheavily in upon his swimming senses; he sank slowly to the floor at\nlast. He was numbed, and his mind was as blank as the black\nnothingness that spread before his staring eyes. In a condition almost\nof coma, he had no measure or count of the hours that passed.\n\nThen a fever of impatience possessed him; his thoughts, springing\nsuddenly to life, were too wildly improbable for any sane mind, were\ndriving him mad. He forced himself to move cautiously.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the floor he had seen burnished gold, shining dully as he entered.\nThere had been a thick vein of yellow in the rock. The floor, at that\nplace, was rough beneath his feet, as if the hot metal had been\nspilled.\n\nHis hands groped before him as he remembered the heaps of rock\nfragments. Then his feet found one of them stumblingly, and he turned\nand moved to one side. He remembered having seen a dim shape off there\nthat had made a straight slanting line. His searching hands\nencountered the object and kept him from walking into it.\n\nThe feeling of helplessness that drove him was only being increased by\nhis blind and blundering movements. He told himself that he must wait.\n\nSilently he stood where he had come to a stop, hands resting on the\nobject that barred his way--until suddenly, stiflingly, his breath\ncaught in his throat. Some emotion, almost too great to be borne, was\nsuffocating him.\n\nSlowly he moved his hands. Inch by inch he felt his way around the\nsmooth cylinder, so hard, so coldly metallic. Then, with a rush, he\nlet his hands follow up the slanting thing, up to a rounded top, to a\nheavy ring and a shackle that was on the end of a cable, thin and\ntaut. And, while his hands explored it feverishly, the metal moved!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe clung to the smooth roundness as it slipped through his hands. It\nwas the bailer, part of his own equipment. That slender cable reached\nup, straight up to the world he knew. And Smithy was there--Smithy was\nhoisting it!\n\nHe clung to the cylinder desperately. The bore, at this depth, had\nbeen reduced to eight inches; the bailer fitted it loosely. And Rawson\ncursed frantically the narrow space that would let this inanimate\nobject return but would hold him back, while he wrapped his arms about\nthe cold surface of the metal messenger from another world.\n\nIt lifted clear, then settled back. This time it dropped noisily to\nthe floor. And suddenly Dean was tearing at the ring on one of the\nswollen fingers of his left hand.\n\nIt came free at last; it was in his hand as the cable tightened again.\nSwiftly, surely, he worked in the darkness to jam the ring through the\nshackle at the bailer's top. Then the bailer lifted, clanged loudly as\nit entered the shattered bore in the rocks above, and scraped noisily\nat the sides. The sound rose to a rasping shriek that went fainter and\nstill fainter till it dwindled into silence.\n\nBut Dean Rawson, standing motionless in the darkness of that buried\nvault, dared once more to let himself think and _feel_ as he stared\nblindly upward.\n\nUp there Smithy was waiting. Smithy would know. And with Smithy\nfighting from the outside and he, Rawson, putting up a scrap below....\nHe smiled almost happily as his hand rested upon his gun.\n\nHopeless? Of course it was hopeless. No use of really kidding\nhimself--he didn't have the chance of a pink-eyed rabbit.\n\nBut he was still smiling toward that dark roof overhead as the\noutlines of a metal door grew cherry red. They were coming for him!\nHe was ready to meet whatever lay ahead....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_A Subterranean World_\n\n\nThe metal plate that had sealed him in this tomb fell open with a\ncrash. Beyond it the passageway was alive with crowding red figures.\nAbove their heads the nozzles of a score of flame-throwers spat jets\nof green fire. Rawson drew back in sudden uncontrollable horror as\nthey came crowding into the room.\n\nThe familiar feel of the bailer's cold metal had given him a momentary\nsense of oneness with his own world. Now this inrush of hideous,\ndemoniac figures beneath the flare of green flames was like a fevered\nvision of the infernal regions come suddenly to actuality.\n\nRawson retreated to the shattered, rocky wall and prepared for one\nlast fight, until he realized that the evil black eyes in their\nghastly circles of white skin were fixed upon him more in curiosity\nthan in active hatred.\n\nThey formed a semicircle about him--a wall of red bodies, whose\npointed heads were craned forward, while an excited chatter in their\nbroken, whistling speech filled the room with shrill clamor. Then one\nof them pointed above toward the open shaft that Rawson had drilled,\nthe shaft up which the bailer had gone. And again their voices rose in\nweird discord, while their long arms waved, and red, lean-fingered\nhands pointed.\n\nOnly a moment of this, then one of them gave an order. Two of the red\nfigures came toward Rawson where he was waiting. They were unarmed.\nThey motioned that he was to go with them. And Dean, with a helpless\nshrug of his shoulders, allowed them, one on each side, to take him\nby the arms and hurry him through the open door. Two others went\nahead, the green jets of flame from their weapons lighting the\npassage.\n\nThe system of communicating tunnels seemed at first only the vents and\nblow-holes from some previous volcanic activity. And yet, at times\nthey gave place to more regular arrangement that plainly was\nartificial. The air in them was pure, though odorous with a pungent\ntang which Dean could not identify. Through some of the passages it\nblew gently with uncomfortable warmth.\n\nThe guard of wild red figures hurried him along through a vast world\nof caverns and winding passages which seemed one great mine. The\nrichness of it was amazing. Dean Rawson was a man, a human being,\nfacing death in some form which he could not yet know, and, so fast\nhad his wild experiences crowded in upon him, he seemed numbed to all\nnormal emotions; yet through it all the mind of the engineer was at\nwork, and Dean's eyes were flashing from side to side, trying to see\nand understand the ever-changing panorama of a subterranean world.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMole-men, both red and yellow, were everywhere. But it was apparent at\na glance that the yellow giants were a race of toilers--slaves, driven\nby the reds.\n\nTheir great bodies glowed orange-colored with the reflected heat of\nthe blasts of flame used to melt the metals from their ores. Gold and\nsilver, other metals that Rawson could not distinguish in the half\nlight--the glow of the molten stuff came from every distant cave that\nthe passages opened up.\n\nThe sheer marvel of it overwhelmed him. His own danger, even the death\nthat waited for him, were forgotten.\n\nA world within a world--and who knew how far it extended? Mole-men, by\nscores and hundreds, the denizens of a great subterranean world, of\nwhich his own world had been in ignorance. Here was civilization of a\nsort, and now the barriers that had separated this world from the\nworld above had been broken down; the two were united. Suddenly there\ncame to Rawson's mind a flashing comprehension of a menace wild and\nterrible that had come with the breaking of those barriers.\n\nThey were passing through a wider hall when the whistling chatter of\nDean's escort ceased. They were looking to one side where a cloud of\nsmoke had rolled from a slope beyond. One of the red figures\nstaggered, choking, from the cloud. Two yellow mole-men followed\nclosely after.\n\nThe red mole-man was unarmed; each yellow one had a flame-thrower that\nwas now so familiar a sight to Dean. His own escort was silent; they\nhad halted, watching those others expectantly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the silence of that rocky room the single red one whistled an\norder. One of the two yellow men placed his weapon on the floor.\nAnother shrill order followed, and the remaining worker, without a\nmoment's hesitation, turned the green blast of his own projector upon\nhis comrade.\n\nIt was done in a second--a second in which the giant's shriek ended in\na flash of flame for which his own flesh was the fuel. A wisp of\ndrifting smoke, and that was all. And the red creatures who had Rawson\nin their charge, after a moment of silence, filled the room with\nshrill-voiced pandemonium, while they shrieked their approval of the\nspectacle.\n\nBut Dean Rawson's lips were forming half-whispered words, so intently\nwas he thinking the thoughts. \"The damned red beast! That poor devil's\nflame hit some sulphur, I suppose--burned it to SO_2--then he got\nhis!\"\n\nBut, even while he searched his mind for words to describe the evil of\nthis red race, he was realizing another fact. These yellow giants,\ncountless thousands of them, perhaps, were held in subjection by their\nred masters. They would do as they were told. Dimly, vaguely, through\nhis horrified mind, came the picture of a horde of red and yellow\nbeasts turned loose upon the world above.\n\nThere were fears now which filled Dean Rawson, shook him with horrors\nas yet only half comprehended. But the fears were not for himself, one\nsolitary man in the grip of these red beasts--he was fearing for all\nmankind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis guard was hurrying him on, but now Dean hardly saw the scenes of\nfeverish activity through which they passed. Another thought had come\nto him.\n\nThat shaft, the hole which he himself had drilled--what damage had it\ndone? It was he who had broken down the barriers. His drill had told\nthese beasts that there was other life above. It had guided them. They\nhad realized that they were near to some other place where men worked\nand drove tunnels through the rocks. They had followed up these\nforgotten passages that led to the old craters, had ascended inside\nthe volcano, made their way through the top and emerged into another\nworld--a clean and sunlit world.\n\nNow Rawson's eyes found with new understanding the activity about him.\n\nThe mining operations had been left behind. Here were branching\npassages, great cavelike rooms--a world within a world, in all truth.\nThroughout it, demoniac figures were hurrying, driving thousands of\ngiant yellow slaves where the light shone sparkling from innumerable\nheaps of metal weapons--flame-throwers and others, the nature of which\nRawson could not determine. And everywhere was the shouting and hurry\nas of a nation in the throes of war.\n\nHis speculations ended abruptly. They were approaching a room, a vast\nopen place. High on the farther wall was a recess in the rock in which\ntongues of flame licked hungrily upward. The heat of the fires struck\ndown in a ceaseless hot blast. Close to the fires, unmindful of the\nheat, a barbaric figure assumed grotesque and horrible postures, while\nits voice rose in echoing shrillness.\n\nBelow were crowding red ones who prostrated themselves on the rocky\nfloor.\n\n\"Fire worshipers!\" The explanatory thought flashed through Dean\nRawson's mind. \"Here was one of their holy places, a place of\nsacrifice, perhaps, and he was being taken there, helpless, a\ncaptive!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_Plumb Loco_\n\n\nThe sheriff of Cocos County was reacting exactly as Rawson had\nanticipated. Smithy stood before him, a disheveled Smithy, grimy of\nface and hands. He had made his way to the highway and caught a ride\nto the nearest town, and now that he had found Jack Downer, sheriff,\nthat gentleman leaned back in his old chair behind the battered desk\nand regarded the younger man with amused tolerance.\n\n\"Now, that's right interesting, what you say,\" he admitted. \"Tonah\nBasin, and the old crater, and red devils settin' fire to everything.\nI've heard some wild ones since this Prohibition went into effect and\nsome of the boys started makin' their own, but yours sure beats 'em\nall. Guess likely I'll have to take a run up Tonah way and see what\nkind of cactus liquor they're makin'.\"\n\n\"Meaning I'm drunk or a liar.\" Smithy's voice was hot with sudden\nanger, but the sheriff regarded him imperturbably.\n\n\"Well, I'd let you off on one count, son. You do look sort of sober.\"\n\nSmithy disregarded the plain implication and fought down the anger\nthat possessed him.\n\n\"May I use your phone, Mr. Downer?\" he asked.\n\nHe called the office of Erickson and his associates in Los Angeles and\ntold, as well as he could for the constant interruptions from his\nlistener, the story of what had occurred. And Mr. Erickson at the\nother end of the line, although he used different words, gave somewhat\nthe same reply as had the sheriff.\n\n\"I refuse to listen to any more such wild talk,\" he said. \"If our\nproperty has been destroyed, as you say, there will be an accounting,\nyou may be sure of that. And now, Mr. Smith, get this straight, you\ntell Rawson, wherever he is hiding, to come and see me at once.\"\n\n\"But I tell you he has been captured,\" said Smithy desperately. \"He's\ngone.\"\n\n\"I rather think we will find him,\" was the reply. \"He had better come\nof his own accord. His connection with us will be severed and all\ndrilling operations in Tonah Basin will be discontinued, but Mr.\nRawson will find that his responsibility is not so easily evaded.\"\n\nThe sheriff could not have failed to realize the unsatisfactory nature\nof the conversation; he must have wondered at the satisfied grin that\nspread across Smithy's tired face.\n\n\"Do you mean you're through?\" he demanded. \"You're abandoning Rawson's\nwork?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" was Mr. Erickson's crisp response.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSmithy, as the telephone clicked in his ear, turned again to the\nsheriff. \"That unties my hands,\" he said cryptically. \"One more call,\nif you please.\"\n\nThen to the operator: \"Get me the offices of the Mountain Power and\nLighting Corporation in San Francisco. I will talk with the\npresident.\"\n\nThe sheriff of Cocos County chuckled audibly. \"You'll talk to the\npresident's sixteenth assistant secretary, son,\" he told Smithy. \"And\nI take back what I said before--now I know you're plumb loco. By the\nway, son, it costs money for telephone calls like that. I hope you\nain't, by any chance, overlookin'--\"\n\nBut Smithy was speaking into the telephone unmindful of the sheriff's\nremarks.\n\n\"Is Mr. Smith in his office?\" he was inquiring. \"Yes, President\nSmith.... Would you connect me with him at once, please? This is\nGordon Smith talking.\"\n\n\"Hello, Dad,\" he said a moment later. \"Yes, that's right. It's the\nprodigal himself. Now, listen, Dad, here's something important. Can\nyou meet me in Sacramento and arrange for us to see the Governor--get\nhis private, confidential ear? I'll beat it for Los Angeles--charter\nthe fastest plane they've got....\"\n\nThere was more to the conversation, much more, although Smithy\nrefrained from giving details over the phone. An operator was breaking\nin on the conversation as he was about to hang up.\n\n\"Emergency call,\" the young woman's voice was saying. \"We must have\nthe line at once.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSmithy handed the telephone to the sheriff. \"Someone's anxious to talk\nto you,\" he said. He searched his pockets hurriedly, found a\nten-dollar bill which he laid on the sheriff's desk. \"That will cover\nit,\" he said with a new note in his voice. \"Perhaps you're not just\nthe man for this job, sheriff. It's going to be a whole lot too hot\nfor you to handle.\"\n\nHe had turned quickly toward the door, but something in the sheriff's\nexcited voice checked him. \"Burned? Wiped out, you say?\"\n\nHalfway across the room Smithy could hear another hoarse voice in the\ntelephone. The sheriff repeated the words. \"Red devils! They wasn't\nInjuns? The whole town of Seven Palms destroyed!\"\n\n\"I thought,\" said Smithy softly to himself, \"that we'd have to go down\n_there_ to find _them_, and instead they're out looking for us. Yes, I\nthink this will be decidedly too hot for you to handle, sheriff.\" He\nturned and bolted out the door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn attentive audience was awaiting Gordon Smith on his arrival in\nSacramento. Smithy's father was not one to be kept waiting even by the\nGovernor of the state. Also, Smithy was coming from the Tonah Basin\nregion, and the news of the destruction of the desert town of Seven\nPalms had preceded him. Even the swift planes of the Coastal Service\ncould not match the speed of the radio news.\n\nThere were only two men in the room when Smithy entered. One of them,\ntall, heavily built, as square-shouldered as Smithy, came forward and\nput his two hands on the young man's shoulders. Their greetings were\nbrief.\n\n\"Well, son?\" asked the older man, and packed a world of questioning\ninto the interrogation.\n\n\"O. K., Dad,\" said Smithy simply.\n\nHis father nodded silently and turned to the other man. \"Governor, my\nson, Gordon. He got tired of being known as the 'Old Man's\nson'--started out on his own--not looking for adventure exactly, but I\njudge he has found it. He's got something to tell us.\"\n\nAnd again Smithy told his wild, unbelievable tale. But it was not so\nincredible now, for, even while Smithy was talking, the Governor was\nglancing at the report on his desk which told of the destruction of\nthe little town of Seven Palms.\n\n\"I can't tell you what it means,\" Smithy concluded. He paused before\nventuring a prediction which was to prove remarkably accurate. \"But I\nsaw them--I saw them come up out of the earth, and I'm betting there\nare plenty more where they came from. And now that they've found their\nway out, we've got a scrap on our hands. And don't think they're not\nfighters, either. They're armed--those flame-throwers are nothing we\ncan laugh off, and what else they've got, we don't know.\"\n\nHe leaned forward earnestly across the Governor's desk. \"But that's\nyour job,\" he said. \"Mine is to find Dean Rawson. He's alive, or he\nwas. He sent up his ring as proof of it. I've got to find him--I've\ngot to go down in that pit and I want your help.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n_The White-Hot Pit_\n\n\nHow far his guard of wild, red man-things had taken him Dean Rawson\ncould not know. Many miles, it must have been. And he knew that the\nair had grown steadily more stiflingly hot. But the heat of those long\ntunneled passages was like a cool breeze compared with the blasting\nbreath of the room into which he was plunged.\n\nIt seared his eyeballs; it struck down from the tongues of flame that\nplayed in red fury in the recess high up on the farther wall. And the\nvast room, the fires, the hundreds of kneeling figures, all blurred\nand swam dizzily before him.\n\nThe hot air that he breathed seemed crisping his lungs. Vaguely, for\nthe stupefying, brain-numbing heat, he wondered at the figure he saw\ndimly in its grotesque posturing close to the flames. And the hundreds\nof others--how could they live? How could he himself go on living in\nthis inferno?\n\nThey had been chanting in unison, the kneeling red ones. Dean heard\nthe regular beat of their repeated words change to an uproar of\nshrill, whistling voices. But he could neither see nor hear plainly\nfor the unbearable, suffocating heat.\n\nThe clamor was deafening, confusing; it echoed tremendously in the\nrocky room and mingled with the steady, continuous roar of the flames.\nThe mass of bodies that surged about him made only a blurring\nimpression; he tried to make himself see clearly. He must fight--fight\nto the last! Only this thought persisted. He was striking out blindly\nwhen he knew that his red guard had cleared a way through the mob and\nwas dragging him forward.\n\nHe knew when they reached the farther wall. Somewhere above him was\nthe deep-cut niche in which the fires roared. And then, when again he\ncould see from his tortured eyes, he found directly ahead another\ndoorway in the solid rock. Beyond it all was black; it gave promise of\ncoolness, of relief from the stifling air of the room. Red hands were\nthrusting him through.\n\nThe burst of water, icy cold, that descended upon him from above\nshocked him from the stupor that claimed his senses. He was drenched\nin an instant, strangling and gasping for breath. But he could think!\nAnd, as the lean hands seized him again and hurried him forward, he\nalmost dared to hope.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo his eyes the passageway was a place of utter darkness, but the red\nones, their great owl eyes opened wide, hurried him on. His stumbling\nfeet encountered a flight of steps. With the red guard he climbed a\nwinding stair where the tunnel twisted upward.\n\nThat icy deluge had set every nerve aquiver with new life. He hardly\ndared ask himself what might lie ahead. Yet he had been saved from\nthat mob; it might be his life would be spared, that in some way he\ncould learn to communicate with these people, learn more of this\nsubterranean world--which must be of tremendous extent. Without any\nsure knowledge of their plans, he still was certain in his own mind\nthat they intended to swarm out upon the upper world. He might even be\nable to show them the folly of that.\n\nA thousand thoughts were flashing through his mind when the tunnel\nended. Beyond a square-cut opening the air was aglow with red. An\nominous thunder was in his ears. Then a score of hands lifted him\nbodily and threw him out upon a rocky floor that burned his hands as\nhe fell.\n\nHeat, blistering, unbearable, beat upon him. He was wrapped in\nquick-rising clouds of steam from his wet clothes.\n\nThe platform ended. Far below was a sea of red faces, grotesque and\nhorrible, where each held two ghastly white disks, and at the center\nof each disk a mere pinpoint eye.\n\nHe saw it all in the instant of his falling--the inhuman, shrieking\nmob, the blast of hot flame not forty feet away at the back of the\nrocky niche, and, between himself and the flame, a giant figure that\nleaped exultantly, while its body, that appeared carved from metallic\ncopper, reflected the red fires until it seemed itself aflame.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDean knew in the fraction of a second while he scrambled to his feet,\nthat the great room had gone silent. The roaring of the flames ceased;\neven the clamor of shrill voices was stilled. He had thrown one arm\nacross his face to shield his eyes; the heat still poured upon him\nlike liquid fire. But his instant decision to throw himself out and\ndown into the waiting mob was checked by the sudden stillness.\n\nTo open his eyes wide meant impossible torture, yet he forced himself\nto peer through slitted lids beneath the shelter of his arm.\n\nThe flame was gone. Where it had been was a wall of shimmering red\nrock above a gaping throat in the floor, whose rim was quivering white\nwith heat. Here the blast from some volcanic depth had come.\n\nThen he saw it, saw the great coppery figure leaping upon him--and saw\nmore plainly than all this the end that had been prepared for him.\n\nFire worshipers! Demons of an under world paying tribute to their god.\nAnd he, Dean Rawson, was to be a living sacrifice, cast headlong to\nthat waiting, white-hot throat!\n\nThe coppery giant was upon him in the instant of his realization.\nSomehow in that moment Dean Rawson's wracked body passed beyond all\npain. With the inhuman, maniacal strength of a man driven beyond all\nreason and restraint he tore himself half free from those encircling\narms and drove blow after blow into the hideous face above him.\n\nOnly his left arm was free. That, too, was clamped tightly against his\nbody an instant later.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe giant had been between him and the glowing rocks. Now he felt\nhimself whirled in air, and again the blast of heat struck upon him.\nHe was being rushed backward; and there flashed through his mind, as\nplainly as if he could actually see it, the scintillant whiteness of\nthat hungry throat.\n\nHe tried to lock his legs about the big body to prevent that final\nheave and throw that would end a ghastly ceremony. The rocks were\nclose, their radiant heat wrapped about him like a living flame.\nAbruptly his strength was gone--the fight was over--he had lost! His\nheart sent the blood pounding and thundering to his brain; his lungs\nseemed on fire.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe high priest of the red ones had his priestly duty to perform--the\nsacrifice must be offered. But even the high priest, it would seem,\nmust have been not above personal resentment. Sacrilege had been\ndone--a fist had smashed again and again into the holy one's face.\nThis it must have been that made him pause, that brought one big hand\nup in a grip of animal rage about Dean's throat.\n\nOnly a moment--a matter of seconds--while he vented his fury upon this\nwhite-skinned man who had dared to oppose him. Dean felt the hand\nclose about his throat. So limp he was, so drained of strength, he\nmade no effort to tear it loose. He was _dead_--what mattered a few\nseconds more or less of life? And then a thrill shot through him as he\nknew his right hand was free.\n\nThat hand made fumbling work of drawing a gun from its smoking,\nleather holster. He could hardly control the numbed, blistered\nfingers, yet somehow he crooked one about the trigger; and dimly, as\nfrom some great distance, he heard the roar of the forty-five....\nThen, from some deep recess within him, he summoned one last ounce of\nstrength that threw him clear of the falling body.\n\nInstinctively he had heaved himself away from the fiery rocks; the\nsame effort had sent his big coppery antagonist staggering, stumbling,\nbackward. And Dean, sprawled on the stone floor, whose heat where he\nlay was just short of redness, heard one long, despairing shriek as\nthe giant figure wavered, hung in air for a moment in black outline\nagainst the fierce red of a rocky wall above a white-hot pit, then\ntoppled, pitched forward, and vanished.\n\nSick and giddy, he forced himself to draw his body up on hands and\nknees. Then he straightened, came to his feet, and staggered forward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBelow him was pandemonium. The sea of faces wavered and blurred before\nhis eyes. From a distant archway other figures were coming. He saw the\ngleam of metal, heard the wild blare of trumpets, and knew that the\nhundreds of red ones below him were standing stiffly, both hands\nraised upright in salute as another barbaric figure entered. The air\nwas clamorous with a shrill repeated call. \"Phee-e-al!\" the red ones\nshrieked. \"Phee-e-al!\"\n\nBut Rawson did not wait to see more. Behind him, the flames that had\nbeen fed with human flesh--if indeed these red ones were human--roared\nagain into life. He had returned the pistol to its holster when first\nhe came to his feet; his weak hands had seemed unable to hold it. And\nnow his two hands were thrust outward before him as he staggered\nblindly toward the tunnel mouth.\n\nIt was where he had emerged upon the platform. His reaching hands\nfound the side entrance where the stairs led down to the main hall.\nIn the darkness he made his way past. Stumbling weakly he pushed on\ndown the long tunnel whose floor slanted gently away.\n\nAhead of him was a light. The comparative coolness of these rocks had\nserved to revive him somewhat. He had no hope of escape, yet the light\nseemed comforting, somehow.\n\nHe stopped. His stinging eyes were wide open. He stared incredulously\nat the glowing spot on a distant wall, where a flame must have\ntouched, and at the figure beneath it.\n\nThe figure of a woman! A young woman, tall, slender, fair-haired,\nwhose skin was white, a creamy white, whiter than snow.\n\nA woman? It was a mere girl, slender and beautiful, her graceful young\nbody poised as if, in quick flight, she had been caught and held for a\nmoment of stillness.\n\nWhat was she doing here? His exhausted brain could not comprehend what\nit meant. He had seen women of the Mole-men tribe mingling with the\nmen. Like them their heads were pointed, their faces grotesque and\nhideous. Rawson gave an inarticulate cry of amazement and staggered\nforward.\n\nBetween him and the distant figure a crowd of Reds swarmed in. They\ncame from a connecting passage. Above their heads the lava tips of\nflame-throwers were spitting jets of green fire. Every face was turned\ntoward him at his cry.\n\nBeyond them the white figure vanished. Dean, leaning weakly against\nthe wall, told himself dully that it had been a phantom, a product of\nhis own despairing brain and his own weakness. Then that weakness\novercame him; and the red Mole-men, their white and hideous eyes, the\nthreatening jets of green flame, all vanished in the quick darkness\nthat swept over him....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n_Dreams_\n\n\nThe black curtain of unconsciousness which descended so quickly upon\nRawson was not easily thrown off. For hours, days or weeks--he never\nknew how long he lay in the citadel of the Reds--it was to wrap him\naround.\n\nNor was his waking a matter of a moment. Many and varied were the\nimpressions which came to him in times of semiconsciousness, and which\nof them were realities and which dreams, he could not tell.\n\nHe was being tortured with knives, lances tipped with pain that\ndragged him up from the black depths in which he lay. Dimly he\nrealized that his clothes were being stripped from him and that the\npiercing knives were none the less real for being only the touch of\nhands and rough cloth upon his blistered body. Then from head to foot\nhe was coated with a substance cool and moist. The pain died to a mere\nthrobbing and again he felt himself sinking back into unconsciousness.\n\nThere were other visions, many others, some of them plain and\ndistinct, some blurred and terrifying to his fevered brain trying\nvainly to bring order and reason into what was utterly chaotic.\n\nOnce a bedlam of shrieking voices roused him. He tried to open his\neyes, whose lids were too heavy for his strength. And by that he knew\nhe was dreaming. Yet from under those lowered lids he seemed to see a\nwild medley of red warriors, their faces blotched and ghastly in the\ngreen light of their weapons. They were carrying a charred body which\nthey threw heavily upon the floor beside him as if to compare the two.\nHe saw the face which the flames had not touched, the face of Jack\nDowner--Downer, the sheriff of Cocos County. His sandy hair had been\nscorched to the scalp.\n\nDreams ... and the steady beat of metal-shod feet of marching men. He\nsaw them passing some distance away. The repeated _thud-thud_ of metal\non stone echoed maddeningly through his brain for hours.... Dreams,\nall of them.\n\nAnd once there came to him a vision which beyond all doubt was unreal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSilence had surrounded him. For what seemed hours not one of the red\nmole-men had come near. And then, in the silence, he heard whisperings\nand the sound of stealthy feet; and, for a moment, the same white\nfigure that had met him in his flight stood where he could see.\n\nOnly the merest trace of dim light relieved the utter darkness of the\nroom. The girl's figure was ghostly, unreal. Yet he saw the dull\nsparkle of jeweled breast-plates against her creamy white skin. Loose\nfolds of cloth were gathered about her waist; her golden hair was\ndrawn back except for vagrant curls that only accentuated the perfect\noval of her face.\n\nThere were others with her, dim shapes of men; how many Rawson could\nnot tell. They looked down at him, whispering softly, excitedly,\namongst themselves; but their words were like nothing he had ever\nheard.\n\nFor an instant Dean felt his stupefied mind coming almost to\nwakefulness. Phantom figures, ghostly and unreal--but the faces were\nhuman, and the eyes looked down upon him pityingly. He tried to rouse\nhimself, tried to call out, then settled limply back, for the girl was\nspeaking--or he was catching her thoughts. It seemed almost that he\nheard her whispered words:\n\n\"They take him to _Gevarro_, to the Lake of Fire which never dies!\nGor told me--he overheard their plans. But, by the Mountain I\nswear....\" Then footsteps echoed in a far-off passage, and the white\nones vanished like drifting smoke.\n\nDreams, all of them. Yet the time came when Dean knew that he was\nawake--knew too that further experiences awaited him in this demoniac\nland.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain red guards came. The wicked breath of their weapons filled the\ngreat room where Rawson had been with green, flickering light. Dean,\ndragged to his feet, was unable to stand. One of the giant yellow\nworkers came forward at a whistled order and held him erect. Another\nbrought a bowl carved from rock crystal and filled with a liquid\ngolden-green with reflected light. He put it to Rawson's lips and with\nthe first touch Dean knew that he must have been filled with a burning\nthirst beyond anything he had ever known. He gulped greedily at the\nliquid, drained the bowl to the last drop, then marveled at the\nthrilling fire of strength that flowed through him.\n\n\"Wine,\" he thought, \"wine of the gods--or devils.\" He came to himself\nwith a start. He knew that he was naked and that his body was encased\nin a coating of stiff gray plaster. It was this that prevented his\narms and legs from flexing.\n\nAnother order and the giant worker picked him up in his arms and\ncarried him where the others led to a distant room. A stream trickled\nthrough a cut in the rocky floor. At the center of the room was a\npool. Unable to resist, Dean felt the giant arms toss him out and\ndown.\n\nThe water was warm. At its first touch the hard plaster melted like\nsnow. Sputtering and choking for breath, Rawson came to the surface.\nHe found he could move freely, then reaching hands hauled him out\nupon the floor, and through all his dread he found time to marvel at\nhis own firm muscles and the healthy white of his skin that had been\nseared and blistered.\n\nHe obeyed when the red guards pointed and motioned him into a dark\npassageway. He tried to keep up with them as they hurried him on.\nEvidently his pace was too slow, for again the big worker picked him\nup, swung him into the air and seated him firmly on one broad\nshoulder, and, with red guards ahead and behind them, hurried on.\n\nTo find himself a child in the hands of this big yellow man was\ndisconcerting. To be calmly lugged off was almost humiliating. No one\nwho was not a good sport could have grinned as Rawson did at his own\npredicament.\n\n\"Not exactly a triumphal procession,\" he told himself, then his lips\nset grimly. \"They've got my gun,\" he thought, \"and now, whatever\ncomes, all I can do is stand and take it. Still, they've saved my\nlife. But what for?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlways the way led downward, and Rawson, perched on his strange,\nhalf-human steed, let his gaze follow up every branching tunnel and\nwidespread cave. Not all of these were as dark as the broad\nthoroughfare they followed. In some, strange lights glowed, and Rawson\nsaw weird, towering plant growths that yellow workers were harvesting.\n\nLife, life, everywhere, and seemingly this underground world was\nendless.\n\nTroops of red warriors passed them, upward bound. The dancing flames\nof their weapons, where occasional ones were in action, glowed from\nafar. They bobbed and waved like green fireflies as the Mole-men came\non at a half-run.\n\n\"And this means trouble up top,\" he thought. \"There's going to be hell\nto pay up there.\"\n\nBut workers, fighters, everyone they met stood aside to let the red\nguard pass. Again Rawson heard the strange word or call that had come\nto him in the temple of fire. One of the guides would give a whistling\ncall that ended in the same strange shrill cry of \"Phee-e-al,\" and\ninstantly the way was cleared.\n\nA wild journey, incredible, unreal. Rawson, as he met the countless\nstaring white eyes of the creatures they passed, found his thoughts\nwandering. He had had wild dreams. Surely this was only another in\nthat succession of phantom pictures. Then, seeing the cold, implacable\nhatred in those staring eyes, he would be brought back with sickening\nabruptness to a full knowledge of his own hopeless situation.\n\n\"Gevarro, the lake of fire which never dies\"--what was it the white\nones had said? But no, that certainly was a dream like that other in\nwhich he had seemed to see the charred body of a man, the sheriff who\nhad called to see him at his camp in Tonah Basin.\n\nDreams--reality--his brain was confused with the wild kaleidoscope of\nunbelievable pictures.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was suddenly aware that through it all he had been mentally\ntabulating their route, remembering the outstanding features when\nthere was light enough to see. He knew that unconsciously his mind had\nbeen thinking of escape. Wilder than all the other visions, he had\nbeen picturing himself retracing his route, alone, free. He did not\nknow that he had laughed aloud, harshly, hopelessly, until he saw the\ncurious eyes of his red guard upon him.\n\n\"Yes,\" he told himself in silent bitterness, \"I could find my way\nback, if....\"\n\nThe guard had swung off from the great tunnel which must have been one\nof the main thoroughfares of the Mole-men's world. They crowded\nthrough a narrower passage and again Rawson found himself in one of\nthe great, high-ceilinged caves like the others he had seen. But\nunlike the others this was brightly lighted.\n\nMassive limestone formation. His eyes squinted against the glare and\ncaught the character of the rock before he was able to distinguish\ndetails, and in the black limestone big disks of gray mineral had been\nset. Jets of flame played upon them and turned them to blazing,\nbrilliant white.\n\nThe big yellow Mole-man who had carried him dropped him roughly to the\nfloor and backed away. About him the red guard was grouped. Rawson\ncaught a glimpse of hundreds of other thronging figures. The crowd\nabout him separated. A space was cleared between him and the farther\nend of the room, a lane lined on either side by solid masses of savage\nReds. And beyond them, more barbaric than any figure in the\nforeground, was another group.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAcross the full width of the room a low wall was raised three or four\nfeet from the floor. It was capped with rude carvings. The whole mass\ngleamed dully golden in the bright light. Beyond the wall in\nsemicircular formation, resembling a grouping of bronze statues, were\nmen like the one with whom Rawson had fought. Priests, tenders of the\nfires. He knew in an instant that here were more of the red one's holy\nmen. They stood erect, unmoving. At their center was another seated\nman-shape that might have been cast from solid gold.\n\nHis naked body was yellow and glittering, contrasting strongly with\nthe black metal straps like those the warriors wore. On his head a\nround, sharply-pointed cap was ablaze with precious stones.\n\nRawson took it all in in one quick glance. He knew that those copper\nbodies were not encased in metal, for the flesh of the one he had\nfought with had sunk under his blows. Their skin was coated with a\npreparation, heat resistant without a doubt, and the golden one must\nhave been treated in somewhat the same way.\n\nHis thoughts flashed quickly over this. It was the face of that seated\nfigure that riveted his attention, a white face, milk-white, so white\nit seemed almost chalky!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor one breathless second Rawson was filled with a wordless hope.\nThose white ones of his dream had looked upon him with kindly eyes.\nThey were human--men of another race, but men. Then beneath the chalky\nwhiteness of the face he found the hideous features of the red\nMole-men, and knew that the white color of the face was as false as\nthat of the golden body.\n\nBut he was their leader. He was someone of importance. Rawson had\nstarted forward impetuously when he saw the figure rise. At the first\nmotion the hands of every red one in the room were flung in air. They\nstood stiffly at salute. Even the priests' coppery arms flashed\nupward. And \"Phee-e-al!\" a thousand shrill voices were shouting.\n\"Phee-e-al! Phee-e-al!\"\n\nRawson stopped, then walked slowly forward, one defenseless, naked man\nof the upper world, between two living walls formed by men of a hidden\nrace.\n\n\"Phee-e-al,\" he was thinking. \"He's the one I saw coming into their\ntemple back there. They got out of our way when they knew we were\ncoming to see him. He's the big boss here, all right.\"\n\nHe did not pause in his steady, forward progress until his hands were\nresting upon the golden barrier. Strange thoughts were racing through\nhis mind. Phee-e-al, he was facing Phee-e-al, king of a kingdom ten\nmiles or more beneath the surface of the earth, a place of devils more\nreal and terrible than any that mythology had dared depict. And he,\nDean Rawson, a man, just one of the millions like him up there in a\nsane, civilized world, was down here, standing at a barrier of gold\nbefore a tribunal that knew nothing of justice or mercy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThoughts of communicating with them had mingled with other half-formed\nplans in his racing mind. Sign language--he had talked with the\nIndians; he might be able to get some ideas across. He met the other's\nfierce scrutiny fearlessly, then, waiting for him to make the first\nadvance, let his gaze dart about at closer range. He could not\nrestrain a start of surprise at sight of his own clothing, his pocket\nradio receiver and his pistol spread out on a metal stand.\n\nThey had been curious about them. Rawson took that as a good sign.\nPerhaps he had been mistaken in his interpretation of what he had\nseen. For himself, he could have no real hope, but it might be that\nthe outpouring of these demons into his own world was a threat that\nlay only in his own imagination.\n\nHis eyes came back to meet that gaze which had never left him. The\neyes were mere dots of jet in a white and repulsive face. The rounded\nmouth opened to emit a shrill whistled order.\n\nIn the utter silence of the great room one of the copper-skinned\npriests moved swiftly toward the rear. There were chests there,\nmassive metal things afire with the brilliance of inlaid jewels. The\npriest flung one of them open with a resounding clang.\n\nThe room had been warm, and the chill which abruptly froze Rawson's\nmuscles to hard rigidity came from within himself. Dreams! He had\nthought them dreams, those marching thousands, and the others who\nreturned. He had dared to hope he might avert an invasion by this\ninhuman horde.\n\nAnd now he knew his worst imaginings were far short of the truth. He\nsaw clearly his own fate. For the priest returning was holding an\nobject aloft, a horrible thing, a naked body, scorched and charred.\nAnd above it a head lopped awkwardly. The hair was sandy; half of it\nhad been burned to the scalp in a withering flame. Below, staring from\nsightless eyes, was the face of the man who had once been sheriff of\nCocos County.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\"_N-73 Clear!_\"\n\n\n\"You fly, of course?\" demanded Governor Drake.\n\nSmithy nodded. \"Unlimited license--all levels.\"\n\nThey had spent the night in the executive mansion, and now the\nGovernor had burst precipitately into the room where Smithy and his\nfather had just finished dressing. The two had been deep in an earnest\nconversation which the Governor's entrance had interrupted.\n\n\"I am drafting you for service,\" said the Governor. \"I want you to go\nout to Field Number Three. A fast scout plane--National Guard\nequipment--will be ready for you--\"\n\nHe broke off and stared doubtfully at a paper in his hand, a\nradiophone message, Smithy judged. \"I'm in a devil of a fix,\" the\nGovernor exclaimed, after a pause. Then:\n\n\"I don't doubt your sincerity,\" he told Smithy. \"Never saw you till\nyesterday, but your father's 'O.K.' goes a hundred per cent with me.\nOld 'J. G.' and I have been through a lot of scraps together.\" His\nfrowning eyes relaxed for a moment to exchange twinkling glances with\nthe older man.\n\n\"No, it isn't that,\" he added, \"but....\" Again he stared at the flimsy\npiece of paper.\n\n\"What's on your mind, Bill?\" asked Smith senior. \"That stuff the boy\ntold us was pretty wild\"--he laid one hand affectionately upon\nSmithy's shoulder--\"but he's a poor liar, Gordon is, and, knowing his\nweakness, he usually sticks to the truth. And there's no record of\ninsanity in the family, you know. If there's something sticking in\nyour crop, Bill, cough it up.\"\n\nAnd the Honorable William B. Drake obeyed. \"Listen to this,\" he\ncommanded, and read from the paper in his hand:\n\n     \"'Replying to your inquiry about the doings at Seven Palms.\n     Some Indians did that job. No help needed. I can handle\n     this. Posse organized and we are leaving right now.--Signed,\n     Jack Downer, Sheriff, Cocos County.'\"\n\n\"That sounds authentic,\" said Smithy drily. \"I've met the sheriff.\"\n\n\"Now, if it _was_ Indians that got tanked up and came down off the\nreservation, burned Seven Palms and cleaned up your camp--\" began\nGovernor Drake.\n\n\"It wasn't!\" Smithy interrupted hotly. \"I told you--\" He felt his\nfather's hand gripping firmly at his shoulder.\n\n\"Steady,\" said Smith, senior. \"Let him talk, son.\"\n\n\"There's an election three months from now, J. G.,\" said the\nGovernor, \"and you know they're riding me hard. Let me make one false\nmove--just one--anything that the opposition can use for a campaign of\nridicule, and my goose is cooked to a turn.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGordon Smith shook off his father's restraining hand and took one\nquick forward step. His face, even through the tan of the desert sun,\nwas unnaturally pale.\n\n\"Election be dammed!\" he exploded. \"Dean Rawson has been captured by\nthose red devils--he's down there, the whitest white man I ever met!\nI've been to the sheriff; now I've come to you! Do you mean to tell me\nthere isn't any power in this state to back me up when--\"\n\nHe stopped. There was a tremble in his voice he could not control.\n\n\"Good boy,\" said Governor Drake softly. \"Now I know it's the truth.\nYes, you'll be backed up, plenty, but for the present it will be\nstrictly unofficial. Now pull in your horns and listen.\n\n\"You know the lay of the land. I want your help. Go out to Field\nThree; there'll be a man there waiting for you. Don't call him\n'Colonel'--he's also strictly unofficial to-day. The sheriff and his\nposse will be there at Seven Palms inside an hour; I want you to be\nthere, too, about five thousand feet up.\n\n\"Tell Colonel Culver--I mean Mr. Culver--your story; tell him\neverything you know. He'll be in charge of operations if we have to\nsend in troops; he'll give you that private and unofficial backing I\nspoke of if we don't.\n\n\"Now get down there; keep your eye on the sheriff's crowd and see\neverything that happens!\"\n\nBut Smithy's parting remark was to his father; it was a continuation\nof the subject they had been discussing before.\n\n\"You can buy at your own price,\" he said. \"They've got rights to the\nwhole basin. But they've quit; I'm not treating them to a\ndouble-cross.\"\n\nAnd he added as he went out of the room: \"Buy it for me if you don't\nwant it yourself.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a two-place, open-cockpit plane that Smithy found had been set\naside for him. Dual control--the stick in the forward cockpit carried\nthe firing grip that controlled the slim blue machine guns firing\nthrough the propeller. Behind the rear cockpit a strange, unwieldy,\ndouble-ended weapon was recessed and streamlined into the fuselage.\nThe scout seemed quite able to protect itself in an emergency.\n\nBeside the plane a tall, slender man in civilian attire was waiting.\nHe stuck out his hand, while the gray eyes in his lean, tanned face\nscanned Smithy swiftly.\n\n\"I'm Culver. Understand I'm to be your passenger to-day. How about\nit--can you fly the ship? Seven hundred and fifty DeGrosse\nmotor--retractable landing gear, of course. She hits four-fifty at top\nspeed--snappy--quick on the trigger.\"\n\nSmithy shook his head dubiously. \"Four-fifty--I'm not accustomed to\nthat. But you can take the stick, Mr. Culver, if I get in a hurry and\njump out and run on ahead. You see I'm used to my own ship, an\n_Assegai_--special job--does five hundred when I'm pressed for time.\"\n\nThe lean face of Mr. Culver creased into a smile. \"You qualify,\" he\nsaid. \"But keep your hands off the dead mule.\"\n\nAt an inquiring glance he pointed to the heavy, half-hidden weapon\nthat Smithy had noticed. \"Can't kick,\" he explained, \"--hence 'dead\nmule.' It's the new Rickert recoilless; throws little shells the size\nof your thumb--but they raise hell when they hit.\"\n\n\"Sounds interesting.\" Smithy climbed into the rear cockpit and\nstrapped himself in. \"Show me how it works, then I won't do it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA pistol grip moved under Culver's reaching hand and the strange\nweapon sprang from concealment like something alive. The pistol grip\nmoved sideways, and the gun swung out and down, its muzzle almost\ntouching the ground. Smithy was suddenly aware that a crystal above\nhis instrument board was reflecting that same bit of sun-baked earth.\nA dot of black hung stationary at the crystal's center.\n\n\"That's your target.\" Culver's voice held all the pride of a child\nwith a new toy, but he released the grip, and the ungainly gun swung\nsmoothly back to its hiding place.\n\nHe settled himself in the forward cockpit. \"You will find a helmet\nthere,\" he said. \"It's phone-equipped; you can tell me all about that\nwild nightmare of yours while we jog along.\"\n\nThe white beam from the despatcher's tower had been on them while they\ntalked. Other planes were waiting on the field. Smithy smiled as he\nsettled the helmet over his head. \"For a strictly unofficial flight,\"\nhe thought, \"we're getting darned good service.\"\n\nHe taxied past a hangar where uniformed men pointedly paid them no\nattention. He swung the ship to the line as Airboard regulations\nrequired.\n\n\"N-73\" was painted on the monoplane's low wings that seemed scraping\nthe ground. \"N-73 Clear!\" the despatcher's voice radioed into Smithy's\nears. Then the seven-hundred-and-fifty-horsepower DeGrosse let loose\nits voice as Smithy gunned her down the field.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhatever doubts Colonel Culver may have had of Smithy's ability were\ndissipated as they made their way cautiously through the free-flying\narea under five thousand. Everywhere were mail planes, express and\npassenger ships taking off for the transcontinental day run, and\nprivate planes scattering to the smaller landing areas among the\nflashing lights of the flat-topped business blocks. Among them Smithy\nthreaded his way toward the green-lighted transfer zone, where he\nspiraled upward.\n\nAt ten thousand he was on his course. He set the gyro-control which\nwould fly the ship more surely than any human hands, and the air-speed\nindicator crept up to the four hundred and fifty miles an hour that\nCulver had promised. Not till then did he give the man in the forward\ncockpit the details of his \"nightmare.\"\n\nHe had not finished answering the other's incredulous questions when\nhe throttled down to slow cruising speed and nosed the ship toward a\ndistant expanse of sage-blurred sand.\n\nOutside the restricted metropolitan area he had already dropped out of\nthe chill wind that struck them at ten thousand. Behind them and off\nto the right was the gray rampart of the Sierra. Ahead a rough circle\nof darker hills enclosed the great bowl he had learned to know as\nTonah Basin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome feeling of unreality in his own experiences must have crept into\nhis mind; unconsciously he had been questioning his own sanity. Now,\nat sight of the sandy waste where he and Rawson had labored, with the\ndark slopes of desolate craters looming ahead and a blot of burned\nwreckage directly below to mark the site of their camp, the horrible\nreality of it gripped him again.\n\nHe could not speak at first. The air of the five-thousand level was\nnot uncomfortably warm, but Smithy was feeling again the baking heat\nof that desert land; again he was with Rawson in the volcanic crater;\nDean was calling to him, warning him....\n\nA sharp question from Culver was repeated twice before Smithy could\nreply.\n\nHe side-slipped in above the crater's ragged rim, heedless of\ndown-drafts--the power of the DeGrosse motor would pull them out of\nanything in a ten-thousand-foot vertical climb if need arose. Smithy\nwas pointing toward a confusion of shining black rock.\n\n\"Over there,\" he told Culver. Then he was shouting into the telephone\ntransmitter. \"It's open,\" he said. \"That's where Dean went down--and\nthere they are! Look, man, there--there!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n_Emergency Order_\n\n\nThe throat of the old volcano was a pit of blackness in the midst of\ngray ash and the red-yellow of cinders. Beside it were other flecks of\ncolor: red, moving bodies; metal, that twinkled brightly under the\ndesert sun--and in an instant they were gone. Nor did Smithy, throwing\nthe thundering plane close over that place, know how near he had\npassed to sudden, invisible death. Rugged pinnacles of rock were\nahead. The plane under Smithy's hands vaulted over them and roared on\nabove the desert.\n\n\"Did you see them?\" Smithy was shouting.\n\nThe man in the forward cockpit turned to face his pilot. \"I am\napologizing, Smith, for all the things I have been thinking and\nhaven't said. We've got a job on our hands. Now let's find that fool\nsheriff who thinks he's hunting for drunken Indians. We must warn\nhim.\"\n\nSmithy wondered at the wisps of blue smoke still rising from the ruins\nof Seven Palms as he drove in above it. It seemed years since he had\nleft the Basin, yet the wreckage of this little town, only five miles\noutside, still smoldered.\n\nColonel Culver was shouting to him. \"East,\" he said. \"Swing east.\nThere's fighting over there.\" Then, in his usual cool tone: \"I'll take\nthe ship, Smith. Give then a burst or two from up here--perhaps the\nsheriff can use a little help.\"\n\nAcross the yellow sand ran a desert road. Ten miles away black smoke\nclouds were lifting. Smithy knew there had been a little settlement\nthere. A dozen houses, perhaps, and a gasoline station. At half that\ndistance the clear sunlight showed moving objects on the sand:\nautomobiles, smaller dots that were running them. They came suddenly\nto sharp visibility as the plane drew near. Tiny bursts of white meant\nrifle fire.\n\nThey were a thousand feet up and close when Smithy saw the first car\nvanish in flame. Others followed swiftly. Men were falling. A dozen of\nthem had made up the sheriff's posse, and now, like the cars, they,\ntoo, burst into flame and either vanished utterly or, like living\ntorches, were cast down upon the sand.\n\nStill no sign of the enemy, more than the ripping stab of green fire\nfrom a sand dune at one side. They were over and past before Smithy,\nlooking back, saw the red ones leap out into view.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCulver must have seen them in the same instant. He throttled down to a\nsafe banking speed. Opened full, the DeGrosse would have whipped them\naround in a turn that would have meant instant death. From five miles\ndistant they shot in on a long slant. Smithy's hands were off the\nstick. It was Culver's ship now.\n\nHe saw the man peering through his sights, then the roar of the motor\nheld other, sharper sounds. Thin flames were stabbing through the\npropeller disk, and he knew that the bow guns were sending messengers\non ahead where red figures waited on the sand.\n\nTheir trajectory flattened. Culver half rolled the ship as they sped\noverhead. \"He wants a look at them,\" Smithy was thinking. Then a blast\nof heat struck him full in the face.\n\nIt was Smithy's hand on the stick that righted the ship; only the\ninstant response of the big DeGrosse motor tore them up and away from\nthe sands that were reaching for those wings.\n\nHis face was seared, but the pain of it was forgotten in the knowledge\nthat their drunken, twisting flight had whipped out the fire licking\nback from the forward cockpit. He saw Culver's head, fallen awkwardly\nto one side. The helmet in one part was charred to a crisp.\n\nHe leveled off. He was thinking: \"Another man gone! Can't I ever fight\nback? If I only had a gun!\" Then he knew he was looking at the pistol\ngrip, where Colonel Culver's brown hand had brought an awkward weapon\nto life. His lips twisted to a whimsical smile, though his eyes still\nheld the same cold fury, as he whispered: \"And I don't even know that\nthe damn thing's loaded--but I'm going to find out!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were clustered on the sands below him as he roared overhead. He\nwas flying at two thousand, the throttle open full. Beside the ship a\ngun swung its long barrel downward. It sputtered almost\nsoundlessly--but where it passed, the sand rose up in spouting\nfountains.\n\nBut his wild speed made the gunfire almost useless. The shell-bursts\nwere spaced too far apart; they straddled the blot of figures.\n\nHe came back at five thousand feet, slowly--until the ship lurched,\nand he saw the right wing tip vanish in a shower of molten metal. He\nthrew the ship over and away from the invisible beam; the plane\nwrithed and twisted across the last half mile of sky. He was over them\nwhen he pulled into a tight spiral, then he swung the pistol grip that\ncontrolled the gun until the dot in the crystal was merged with the\ntarget of clustering red forms. The gun sputtered.\n\nBelow the plane, the quiet desert heaved its smooth surface\nconvulsively into the air. Even above the roar of the motor Smithy\nheard the terrific thunder of that one long explosion.\n\nAbove the rim of the forward cockpit Culver's head rolled uneasily;\nhis voice, thick and uncertain, came back through the phone; and\nlater--only a matter of minutes later, though fifty miles away--Smithy\nset the plane down on a level expanse of sand and tore frantically at\nhis belt. Colonel Culver was weakly raising his head.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What hit us?\" he demanded when Smithy got to him. \"Did I crash?\" He\nlooked about him with dazed eyes from which he never would have seen\nagain, but for the protection of his goggles.\n\n\"Fire,\" said Smithy tersely. \"They did it, the devils, and it wasn't a\nflame-thrower, either. There wasn't a flash of their cursed green\nlight. It just flicked us for a second. You got the worst of it. Your\nhalf roll saved us. That thing, whatever it was, would have ripped our\nleft wing off in a second.\"\n\nHe was looking at the forward cockpit where the metal fuselage was\nmelted. The leather cushioning around the edge was black and charred.\nCulver's helmet had protected him, but half of his face was seared as\nif it had been struck by a white flame.\n\n\"But we got some of them: they know we can hit back....\" Smithy began,\nbut knew he was speaking to deaf ears. Again his passenger had lapsed\ninto unconsciousness.\n\nQuickly he disconnected their own radio receiver and threw on the\nemergency radio siren. Ahead of them for a hundred miles an invisible\nbeam was carrying the discordant blast. Then, with throttle open full,\nregardless of levels and of air traffic that tore frenziedly from his\npath, he drove straight for the home field.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the office of the Governor, the radio newscaster was announcing\nlast-minute items of interest. The Governor switched off the\ninstrument as Smithy entered, supporting the tall figure of Colonel\nCulver, whose face and head were swathed in bandages. Culver had\ninsisted upon accompanying him for the rendering of their report,\nthough Smithy had to do the talking for both of them.\n\nHe outlined their experience in brief sentences. \"And now,\" he was\nsaying grimly, \"you can go as far as you please, Governor. You've got\na man's sized fight on your hands. We don't know how many there are of\nthem. We don't know how fast they'll spread out, but--\"\n\nA shrill wail interrupted him. From the newscasting instrument came a\nflash of red that filled the room. The crystal, the emergency call,\ninstalled on all radios within the past year and never yet used, was\nclamoring for the country's attention.\n\nGovernor Drake sprang to switch it on, and tried to explain to Smithy\nas he did so. \"It's out of my hands now,\" he said. \"Washington has--\"\nThen the radio came on with a voice which shouted:\n\n\"Emergency order. All aircraft take notice. Mole-men\"--Smithy started\nat the sound of the word; it was the name he had given them\nhimself--\"Mole-men are invading Western states. A new race. They have\ncome from within the earth. In Arizona, three ships of the\nTranscontinental Day Line, Southern Division, have been destroyed with\nthe loss of all passengers and crew. Shattered in air.\n\n\"It is war, war with an unknown race. Goldfield, Nevada, is in ruins.\nHeavy loss of life. Federal Government taking control. Air-Control\nBoard orders traffic to avoid following areas....\"\n\nThere followed a list of locations, while still the red crystal blazed\nits warning across the land and to all aircraft in the skies. Southern\nCalifornia, Arizona, Nevada--Southern Transcontinental Routes closed;\nall except military aircraft grounded in restricted areas.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSmithy's excitement had left him. In his mind he was looking far off,\ndeep under the surface of the world. \"They've been there,\" he said\nquietly, \"thousands of years. A new race--and they've just now learned\nof this other world outside. Three ships downed! They picked them off\nin the air just as they tried to do with us. I knew we had a fight on\nour hands.\"\n\nHis voice died to silence in the room where now the new announcer was\ngiving a list of the dead--a room where men were speechless before an\nemergency no man could have foreseen. But Smithy's eyes, gazing far\noff, saw nothing of that room. Again he was seated on an outthrust\npoint of rock, Dean Rawson beside him, and from the black depths\nbeneath a man's voice was rising clearly, mockingly it seemed, in\nsong:\n\n    \"You're pokin' through the crust of hell\n    And braggin' too damn loud of it,\n    For, when you get to hell, you'll find\n    The devil there to pay!\"\n\n\"The devil is there to pay,\" Smithy repeated softly. He leaned across\nand placed one hand on Colonel Culver's knee. \"With your assistance,\nColonel, I'd like to go down there and find him. You and I, we know\nthe way--we'll organize an expedition. Maybe we can settle that debt.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n_The Lake of Fire_\n\n\nBefore a barrier of gold, waist-high, Dean Rawson stood tense and\nrigid. Behind him the great cave-room swarmed with warriors, leaders,\ndoubtless, of the unholy hordes. But beyond the barrier were the real\nleaders of the Mole-men tribes--Phee-e-al, ruler in chief, and his\nclustering guard of high priests. In the flooding light from the wall,\ntheir eyes were circles of dead-white skin. A black speck glinted\nwickedly in the center of each.\n\nPhee-e-al was speaking. His artificially whitened face grimaced\nhideously; the shrill whistling voice made no comprehensible sound.\nBut in some manner Rawson gathered a dim realization of what his\ngestures meant.\n\nPhee-e-al pointed at the captive; and one lean hand, with talons more\nsuggestive of a bird of prey than of a human hand, pointed downward.\n\"Gevarro,\" he said. The word was repeated many times in the course of\nhis whistling talk.\n\n\"Gevarro\"--what did it mean? Then Rawson remembered. It was the word\nhe had heard in his dreams, the name of the lake of fire.\n\nThe voices of the priests rose in a shrill chorus of protests, and\neven Phee-e-al stood silent. They crowded about their ruler, and\nRawson knew they were demanding him for themselves. Then the one who\nstill held a human body in his arms sprang forward and his long talons\nworked unspeakable mutilation upon the body and face.\n\nRawson averted his eyes from the ghastly spectacle. For, swiftly, he\nwas seeing something more horrifying than this desecration of a dead\nbody; he was seeing himself, still living, tortured and torn by those\nsame beastly hands. The dead face of Sheriff Downer was staring at him\nfrom red, eyeless sockets as with one leap Rawson threw himself over\nthe golden wall. Ten leaping strides away was his gun. In that instant\nof realization, he knew why his life had been spared.\n\nIn the room of fire he had destroyed their priest. They had saved him\nfor further torture.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo get his hands on the gun, to die fighting--the thought was an\nunspoken prayer in his mind. Behind him the room echoed with demoniac\nshrieks. Before him was the metal stand. His outstretched hands fell\njust short of the blue .45 as he crashed to the floor. The copper ones\nwere upon him.\n\nHalf stunned by the fall, he hardly knew when they dragged him to his\nfeet. He was facing the golden figure of Phee-e-al, but now the\nruler's indecision had vanished. He was exercising his full authority\nand even Rawson's throbbing brain comprehended the doom that was being\npronounced.\n\n\"Gevarro!\" he was shrieking. \"Gevarro!\"\n\nBeside him a priest swept the metal table clear. Rawson's clothing,\nthe gun, the radio receiver, all were snatched up and hurled into one\nof the massive chests. Phee-e-al was still shouting shrill commands.\nAn instant later Rawson was lifted in air, rushed to the barrier and\nthrown bodily from the sacred premises he had invaded. Then the hands\nof the red guard closed about him before he could struggle to his\nfeet. A shining object swung down above his head. It was the last he\nknew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis dreams were of falling. Always when he half roused to\nconsciousness he was aware of that smooth, even descent, and he knew\nit had continued for hours.\n\nOnce he saw black walls slipping smoothly past, upward, always upward.\nGropingly he tried to marshal his facts into some understandable\nsequence. He was falling, falling toward the center of the earth, and\nthis that he saw was not rock, or any metal such as he knew.\n\n\"It's all different,\" he told himself dully, \"new kind of matter. Rock\nwould flow; this stands the pressure.\" But he knew the air pressure\nhad built up tremendously. The blood was pounding in his ears. He\nwanted to sleep.\n\nIt was the heat that awakened him. The air was stifling him,\nsuffocating. He was struggling to move his heavy body, fighting\nagainst this nightmare of heat when he opened his eyes and knew that\nhe was in a place of light. First to be seen were walls, no longer\nblack, no longer even with the characteristics of rock, or even metal.\nHere, as Rawson had sensed, was new material to form the core of a\nworld. It would have been red in an ordinary light. It was transformed\nto orange, strangely terrifying in the blazing flood of yellow\nbrilliance that came from the tunnel's end.\n\nRawson's brain was not working clearly. An unendurable weight seemed\npressing upon him--the air pressure, he thought, to which he had not\nyet become accustomed. And the air, itself, hot--hot!\n\nA breeze blew steadily past toward that place of yellow horror at the\ntunnel's end. Yellow, that reflected light; but its source was a\nsearing, dazzling white in the one brief instant when Rawson dared\nturn his eyes.\n\nHands held him erect, red, gripping hands. One, whose body seemed\nmolten copper in that fierce glare, approached. His hand described a\ncircle over Rawson's bare chest. Straight lines radiated out from the\ncircle, lines of stabbing pain for the helpless man. He had seen the\nsame emblem in the temple of fire, again in the big room where\nPhee-e-al had stood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe living sacrifice was prepared. Burned into his bare flesh was the\nemblem of their legendary sun-god. The priests, their bodies coated\nwith a flashing coppery film that must somehow be heat-resistant, had\nhim in their grasp.\n\nThe red warriors had fallen back. Then Phee-e-al appeared; he joined\nthe march of death of which Dean Rawson formed the head. Voices were\nchanting--somewhere a trumpet blared. Then Rawson, moving like one in\na dream, knew the priests were guiding him toward that waiting,\nincredible heat.\n\nThe tunnel's end was near. About him was an inferno where heat and hot\ncolors blended. The whole world seemed aflame, but beyond the tunnel's\nend was a seething pit upon which no human eyes could look and live.\n\nOne glimpse only of the unbearable whiteness beneath which was the\nlake of fire, then the chains of his stupor broke and Dean Rawson\nstruggled frenziedly in the grip of two copper giants.\n\nThey had been chanting a shrill monotonous refrain. They ceased now as\nthey fought to throw the man out past that last ten paces where even\nthey dared not go.\n\nRawson was beyond conscious thought. Eyes closed against the\nunendurable heat, he fought blindly, desperately, then knew his last\nstrength was going from him. Still struggling he opened his eyes; some\nthought of meeting death face to face compelled him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA hideous coppery face glared close into his own. Miraculously it\nvanished, disappeared in a cloud of white. Then the blazing walls were\ngone--there was nothing in all the world but rushing clouds of\nwhiteness, shrieking winds, the roar of an explosion--and cold, so\nbiting that it burned like heat.\n\nVaguely he wondered at the hands that still clutched at him. Dimly he\nsensed other bodies close to his, other hands that tore him free where\nhe lay, still struggling with the priests, upon the floor. A narrow\nopening was in the wall, a blur of darkness in the billowing white\nclouds. They were dragging him into it, those others who held him, and\nthey were white--white as the vapor that whirled about him.\n\nAhead, the girl of his former dreams was guiding him, her hand cool\nand soft in his. Others helped him; he ran stumblingly where they led\ndown a steep and narrow way.\n\nThe White Ones! In a vision they had reached out to him before. Was\nthis, too, a dream? Was it only the delirium of death? That burst of\ncold--had it truly been liquid fires, wrapping him around?\n\nDean Rawson could not be sure. He knew only that his fate lay wholly\nin the hands of these White Ones--and that hideous eyes in the coppery\nface of a priest had glared at them as they fled.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n_The Metal Shell_\n\n[Illustration: _She was motioning for him to follow._]\n\n[Sidenote: The Voice of the Mountain heralds Rawson's Messianic coming\nto the White Ones in their hour of need.]\n\n\nDean Rawson had passed through a nerve-racking experience. It was not\na question of courage--Rawson had plenty of that--but there are times\nwhen a man's nervous system is shocked almost to insensibility by\nsheer horror. Not at once did he realize what was happening.\n\nPerhaps it was the sound of pursuit that jarred him out of the fog\nclouding all his thoughts and perceptions. It was like the sound of\nfighting animals--cat-beasts--whose snarls had risen to screaming,\nsqualling shrieks of rage. It was sheer beastliness, the din that\nechoed through that narrow passage.\n\nAhead of him the girl was running. She held a light in her hand. Soft\nwrappings of cloth hung loosely from her waist; like her golden hair,\nit was flung backward in the strong draft of air against which they\nwere struggling. She was outlined clearly before the red, rock-like\nmasses where her light was falling; she was running swiftly,\ngracefully, like a wild, woodland nymph.\n\nTwo men, their milk-white bodies naked but for the thick folds of\ntheir loin cloths, were beside Rawson, helping him along. Two others\nfollowed. And, by their haste and their odd whispered words of alarm,\nhe knew that pursuit had not been expected; they must have thought to\nget away unobserved.\n\nRawson felt his strength returning. He shook himself free from those\nwho tried to aid him. He was amazed at how easily he ran: his weight\nwas a mere nothing; his efforts were expended in driving his body\nagainst the blast of wind. The air seemed dense, thick; he had almost\nthe feeling of forcing himself through water.\n\nAhead of him the girl darted abruptly through a narrow crack in the\nwall. Rawson followed--and then began a wild race through a network of\nconnecting passages, a vast labyrinth of caves, more like fractures in\nthis strange red substance which Rawson could think of only as rock,\nfor lack of a more accurate name, until at last there was no sound\nexcept that of their own hurrying feet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey stopped and stood panting in one of the wider passages. He heard\nnothing but the endless rush of the wind. For the first time Rawson\nbecame aware of his own almost naked condition.\n\nThe mole-men had prepared him for the sacrifice. They had decked him\nwith a loin cloth of woven gold. It felt cold to the touch, and Rawson\ndid not doubt its being made of fine threads of the precious metal.\nAbout his neck hung a gold chain with a heavy object suspended; he\ntore it off, and found again a representation of a golden sun. The\ncopper priests had arrayed him to meet their fire-god, and again\nRawson wondered at the emblem they employed.\n\n\"What in the name of the starlit heavens,\" he demanded silently of\nhimself, \"could this buried race know of the sun?\"\n\nThe others were watching him. In the glow of that strange light held\nby the girl he saw them smiling. They were congratulating one another\nwith odd, soft-syllabled words. And Rawson, ignorant of their tongue,\nwas mute, when his whole soul cried out to thank them.\n\nHe gripped the hands of the men. They were as tall as himself, their\ngaze level with his own. Their faces were human, friendly; their eyes\nsparkled and smiled into his. Then he turned to the girl.\n\nShe had seen the method of greeting this stranger employed. She\nextended her hand--a white hand, slim, soft, cool. And Rawson, choking\nwith emotion, knowing that here was the one who had first seen him and\nwho had returned to save him, a stranger, bent low above that hand,\nheld in his own so rough and burned, and pressed his lips to the\nslender fingers in a quick caress.\n\nWhen he raised his head she was looking at him oddly; her eyes were\ndeep, serious and unsmiling. He wondered if, blunderingly, he had\noffended her. He could not know; he did not know their customs.\n\nAgain the slim girlish figure turned; her jeweled breast-plates\nflashed as she led the others on where always the way led upward and\nthe wind pressed against them unceasingly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe White Ones wore sandals that seemed woven of glass. Rawson's bare\nfeet were bruised and sore, for those narrower clefts had been paved\nonly with broken fragments of the red walls. He moved less easily now.\nThe heavy, beating air tired him; the lightness of his body made it\nall the more difficult to fight the steady wind. Still he followed the\nwhite figure of the girl where her light was flashing on endless walls\nof red.\n\nIn his ears a new sound was registering. Above the rush of the air,\nthat now was soft and warm, a new note had risen to a hollow,\nunremitting roar. He knew that for some time he had been hearing it\nfaintly. It grew louder, one long, steady, unchanging note, as they\nadvanced. It was a deafening reverberation that seemed shaking the\nwhole earth when they came at last to an open room.\n\nIt beat upon him thunderously. As deep as the deepest tone of a mighty\norgan, like a thousand gigantic organs welded in one, it roared and\nshook him through and through with its single note.\n\nExhausted by his wild flight, surrounded by this maelstrom of sound,\nhe sank to the floor and let his laboring lungs have their way. But\nhis eyes were searching the big room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe great cave was too regularly formed to have had a natural origin.\nThe light that the girl had carried gave only feeble illumination in\nso great a space that had so evidently been hollowed out of the solid\nred matter.\n\nThe light flashed here and there as the girl and her companions moved\naway. They were circling the room. Rawson saw the irregular outlines\nof entrances to many dark passages like the one through which they had\ncome. The red rock-mass seemingly had been riven and torn, and\napparently in front of each opening the white figures fought against\nthe rush of outgoing air. Rawson felt the same current sweeping and\nwhirling gustily about him.\n\nNow his companions were across the room, and between him and them in\nthe center of the floor he saw the mouth of a black well, a pit some\ntwenty or more feet across. Directly above, where the red rock stuff\nformed a domed ceiling, he found a counterpart of the pit\nbelow--another great bore or open shaft, roughly circular. Apparently\nit went straight on up and was a continuation of that lower pit.\n\n\"This room was cut out,\" Rawson was thinking, \"by the white people or\nthe mole-men--Lord knows who, or when, or why. Cut out around this big\nshaft....\"\n\nHis thoughts trailed off. Even thinking seemed impossible under the\nbattering of the roaring noise that pounded about him. Then another\nthought pierced through the bedlam. He had found the source of the\nuproar.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat upper shaft, the hole that went on up, must be plugged. There was\nno outlet that way, and this air that drove endlessly upward from the\nroom must be coming from the lower shaft. It was striking up into that\nupper cavity.\n\nAn organ pipe, truly. But whence came the unending blast of air to\nkeep that gigantic instrument in operation? Rawson dropped to his\nknees and crept slowly across the floor toward the pit. He must test\nhis theory--see if that was where the air was driving in.\n\nJust short of the brink he stopped. The girl had called--a cry of\nalarm. She was running swiftly toward him, circling the pit. And\nRawson, as she tugged at him, trying to draw him back, knew that she\nhad mistaken his motive. She had thought he was going to cast himself\ndown.\n\nHe did not need to go farther. He was close to the edge. And now, even\nabove that roaring sound he heard the rush of the column of air. He\nseated himself on the stone floor and smiled up at the girl\nreassuringly. Her eyes that had been dark with fear changed swiftly to\na look so sweetly, beautifully tender that Dean Rawson found himself\nthrilled and shaken by an emotion that set his nerves to quivering\neven more than did the sonorous vibration from above.\n\nHer companions had joined her. Dean saw her eyes regarding them\nsteadily. Then, as if reaching some sudden final conclusion in her\nown mind, she dropped swiftly to her knees beside him, raised one of\nhis hands in hers and pressed her soft lips against it.\n\nAnd Dean, even had he known their language, could not in that moment\nhave spoken. There had been something in the look of her eyes and the\nsoft touch of her lips that of themselves went far beyond words.\n\n\"You darling,\" he was whispering softly to himself as the girl sprang\nto her feet and walked swiftly away, the others following.\n\n\"An angel, no less--down in this damned place!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe wondered, as he watched the flickering light far across the room,\nwhat destination they could be bound for. Surely no one so radiantly\nbeautiful could inhabit a world of endless dungeons like that where\nthe mole-men lived. But if not that, then what? Where would their next\njourney take them? And in what direction would they go?\n\nAgain Rawson's thoughts were submerged beneath his own weariness. This\nair that beat about him had seemed cool after the terrific heat that\ndrove in off the Lake of Fire. Now he realized that the air itself was\nhot. His one spurt of strength and energy had been expended.\n\nHe watched the men disappear into one of the passages, but he roused\nhimself when they returned. They were clinging to a strange device, a\nmetal cylinder that floated in air above their heads like a dirigible\non end. It was about eight feet in diameter and some fourteen feet in\nheight; both upper and lower ends were rounded. A cage of parallel\nbars enclosed it from end to end; like springs of steel they extended\nfrom top to bottom where they curved in and were attached to the\nrounded ends.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRawson sat up quickly and stared in startled amazement at the thing\nglinting like polished aluminum in the light. And his engineer's mind\nresponded as much to that smooth finish and the evident workmanship\nthat had entered into the making of this thing as it did to the object\nitself.\n\nThe girl placed her light on the floor. She, too, reached up and\ngripped a bar of the protecting cage to which the others were holding.\nWith her added weight and strength they drew it down almost to the\nfloor. Rawson knew by their efforts that they were dealing with\nsomething actually buoyant, a metal balloon. One of the men, still\nputting his weight on the bars, reached in and opened a door in the\nsmooth shell. He stepped inside, and a moment later the big shell\ndropped to the floor and, still vertical, stood on the lower rounded\nend of the protecting cage, rocking gently as the hot whirling wind\nhit it.\n\nThey were communicating among themselves by signs. Rawson saw them\nmotioning. Speech was useless in that roaring, pandemonium-filled\nroom.\n\nShe was motioning for him to follow. One of the men circled that\ncentral pit, came beside Rawson and helped him to his feet, steadying\nhim as they crossed the room. The girl had entered the big metal\nshell. Dean saw the glow of her torch shining through the open doorway\nand through two other windows of crystal glass.\n\nThe big room had grown dimmer. The high ceiling was lost in murky\nshadows. All the room was dark save where that light struck upon walls\nand floor to make them glow blood-red. The waiting lighted shell\nseemed a haven of refuge. To get inside, close the door, lock out some\nof this unendurable, battering sound--it was all Rawson asked, all he\ncould think.\n\nThe door closed. He was within the shell, standing on a smooth metal\nfloor. The others were beside him. Dully he wondered what wild\nadventure was ahead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had expected--he hardly knew what. But there should have been\nmachinery of some sort. If this weird balloon thing was actually to\ncarry them, there must be some mechanism, some propelling power. And\ninstead he saw nothing but the shining walls of the circular room and\nat the exact center, reaching from floor to ceiling, a six-inch metal\npost that thickened to a boxlike form on a level with his eyes. There\nwas a plate on the side of that box, a cover, and clamps that held it\nin place, and on an adjoining side two little levers, one near the top\nof the box, the other near the bottom.\n\nHis one all-inclusive glance showed him bull's-eye windows in the\nceiling. There were more of them in the floor. One curved bar,\ncircling the room, was mounted on brackets against the wall. They were\ntelling him by signs that he was to put his hands on it and hang on.\nOne of the men was beside that central post. He too gripped at a\nprojecting hand-hold. His other hand was on the lower lever.\n\nRawson knew his disappointment was unreasonable, but his weary mind\nwas tired of mysteries. Some understandable bit of machinery would\nhave been reassuring. And then in his next thought he asked himself\nwhat difference did it make. If this childish balloon thing were\nreally capable of carrying them somewhere, what of it? It could only\nmean more of this hideous inner world that grew more unbearably\nfantastic with each new experience.\n\nHis life had been saved. True, but for what end? The girl's eyes were\nupon him, reading the expression on his face. She smiled\nencouragingly. Then Rawson's hands tightened upon the metal bar. The\nman who stood by the central post had moved one lever the merest\ntrifle. Rawson felt the floor lifting beneath him. Then the shell,\nlike a bubble of metal, pitched and tossed as the powerful air\ncurrents caught it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis own lightness saved him from injury. He gripped the bar and held\nhimself free of the wall. The round top of their strange craft grated\nagainst the domed roof. Then again the ship steadied and seemed\nmotionless, and Rawson knew they had slipped up into the still air of\nthat upper shaft.\n\nFor one wild instant, filled with impossible hope, Rawson saw this as\na means of ascent to his own world. Then reason tore those wild hopes\nto shreds.\n\n\"It's closed up above,\" he thought. \"It must be. That's why it sounded\nthat way. That's why the air drove off through those side passages.\"\n\nThe next instant held no time for thought. Rawson's whole attention\nwas concentrated upon the bar to which he clung. For, quicker than\nthought, the metal shell, the little cylindrical world in which he and\nthese others were, fell swiftly beneath them.\n\nHis body twisted in mid-air. He knew the others were being thrown in\nthe same manner. Then, what an instant before had been the ceiling was\nnow a floor beneath his feet, pressing up against him and giving him\nweight--and by the whistling rush of the air that tore past their\nshell he knew they had fallen with marvelous swiftness straight down\nthrough the throat of that lower shaft.\n\nAnd now what had been down was up. The ceiling of this strange room\nwas now their floor, but Rawson was not deceived. \"Acceleration,\" he\nsaid. \"It's crowding us. The shell tends to fall faster than we do.\nIt's like an elevator traveling downward at a swifter rate than a free\nfalling body.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had glimpsed the glassy-side of that well into which he knew they\nhad been flung. He knew that the shrieks that filled the room time and\nagain were caused by the touching of their shell's guiding and\nprotecting bars against one glassy wall. Those sounds came always from\nthe same side and Rawson found momentary satisfaction in his own\nunderstanding of the phenomenon.\n\n\"We're falling free,\" he argued within his own mind, \"falling toward\nthe center of the earth. And a falling body wouldn't follow a vertical\ncourse. It would tend to hug against one wall.\" And by that he knew\nsomething of their speed. The necessity for it was apparent a moment\nlater.\n\nAbove his head the bull's-eyes pointing forward in the direction of\ntheir flight were faintly red. Swiftly they changed to crimson. Rawson\nwas standing beside a window in the wall of their craft. That, too,\ngrew quickly to an area of dazzling brightness. Slowly the heat struck\nin. The air in the little room was stifling. He saw the girl turn her\nhead and give a sharp order.\n\nThe man by the central post responded with another slight movement of\nthe lever. Beneath Rawson's feet the floor pressed upward in a surge\nof speed that bent his knees and bore him downward. Under his hands\nthe rod to which he clung was hot. The shining walls were dimly\nglowing. They were being hurled through the very heart of hell....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then it was past. The crimson horror beyond those windows grew\ndull and then black. In the blunt nose of their craft a tiny crevice\nmust have opened. The one who drove that projectile in its shrieking\nflight had touched another control that Rawson had not before seen.\nAnd with a piercing shriek a thin jet of cold air drove down into the\nhot room.\n\nNo wine could have been one-half so potent. That thin jet filled the\nroom with buffeting whirlwinds that grew quickly cold.\n\nThen their speed was checked. Abruptly Rawson was weightless, his body\nhanging in air, moved only as he moved his hand upon the bar. Only a\nfew feet away was the body of the girl floating weightless like\nhimself. The others were shouting loud words of satisfaction, but her\nface was turned toward Rawson, her eyes were smiling into his; while,\noutside the little shell that fell in meteor flight, were only\nshrieking winds and the blackness into which they plunged.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n_Gor_\n\n\nThrough an ordinary experience, Dean Rawson, like any other man, would\nhave kept unconscious measurement of the passing time. An hour, no\nmatter how crowded, would still have been an hour that his mind could\nmeasure and grasp. But now he had no least idea of the hours or\nminutes that had marked their flight. Each lagging second was an age\nin passing. Even the flashing thoughts that drove swiftly through his\nmind seemed slow and laborious. Painstakingly he marshaled his few\nfacts.\n\n\"They know what they're about, that's one thing dead sure. They're\nonto their job, and they've got something here that beats anything\nwe've ever had.\" He mentally nailed that one fact down and passed on\nto the next. \"And that's the bow end of our ship, up there.\" He looked\nabove him at a dented place in the ceiling, the ceiling that had been\nthe floor of the room when first he stepped into it. \"There isn't any\nup or down any more. I've been flipped back and forth every time we\nslowed down or accelerated until I don't know where I'm at, but I saw\nthat dented plate in the floor when I got in and we started falling in\nthat direction. But whether we're falling toward the center of the\nearth still or whether we passed the center back there at that hot\nspot and now this crazy, senseless shell is flying on and up, perhaps\nthese people know--I don't!\"\n\nThen fact No. 3. \"They live somewhere inside here. They're taking me\nthere, of course. It must mean there's a race of them--and they don't\nlike the mole-men. They know the way back, too, and if they'll help\nme.... Perhaps the fighting's not over yet!\"\n\nThrough more endless, age-long seconds there passed through Rawson's\nmind entrancing visions. An army of men like these White Ones, himself\nat their head. They were armed with strange weapons; they were\ninvading the mole-men's world....\n\nThe girl was reaching toward him. She laid one hand upon his, then\npointed overhead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRawson looked quickly above. The glowing bull's-eyes startled him,\nthen he knew it was white-light he was seeing, not the red threat of\nglowing rock. Their speed had been steadily cut down as the air\npressure lessened. \"They're decompressing,\" he thought. \"They're\nworking slowly into the lesser pressure.\"\n\nThe passing air no longer shrieked insanely. Above its soft rushing\nsound he heard the girl's voice; it was clear, vibrant with happiness.\nHer hand closed convulsively over his; her eyes beneath their long\nlashes smiled unspoken words of welcome, of comradeship, and of\nsomething more.\n\nWithin their room her light, which at close range seemed only a\nslender bar of metal with a brilliantly glowing end, had been clamped\nin a bracket against the wall. The illumination had seemed brilliant,\nnow suddenly it was pale and dim.\n\nThrough the bull's-eyes above, a brighter light was shining, clear and\ngolden, like the light of the sun on a brilliant and cloudless day.\nAnd to Rawson, who felt that he had spent a lifetime in the gloomy\ndungeons of that inner world, that flooding brilliance was more than\nmere light. It was the promise of release, the very essence of hope.\nHis eyes clung to these little round windows; then the larger glass\nbeside him blazed forth with the bright sunlight of an open world that\nwas unbearable to one who had lived so long in darkness.\n\nHe held tightly to that slim hand that remained so confidingly within\nhis own.\n\n\"It isn't true,\" Rawson was telling himself frantically. \"It can't be\ntrue. It must be a delusion, another dream.\"\n\nHe gripped the girl's hand in what must have been a painful clasp. He\ntold himself that she at least was real. Her lovely face was before\nhim when at last he could bear to open his eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout him were the others. The cylinder rested firmly upon a surface\nof pale-rose quartz. Inside the shell he saw the floor where he had\nstood, and with that he added one more fact to the few he had gotten\ntogether. There was no dent in the floor. The shell's position was\nreversed. What had been up was now down. Rawson knew he was standing\nfirmly, with what seemed his normal earth weight, upon a smooth\nsurface of rock; he knew that he was standing head down as compared\nwith his position at the beginning of their flight--as compared, too,\nwith the way he had stood in the mole-men's world and in his own world\nup above.\n\n\"I've passed the center of the world.\" The words were ringing in his\nbrain. And then reason shot in a quick denial. \"You're as heavy as you\nwere on earth,\" he told himself. \"You'd have to go through and on to\nthe other side, the opposite surface of the world, before your weight\nwould come back like that!\"\n\n\"What could it mean?\" he was demanding as his eyes came back from the\nmachine and swept around over a gorgeous, glittering panorama of\ncrystal mountains, rose and white. Fields of strange plants, vividly\ngreen; a whole world that rioted madly in a luxury of color. Before\nhim the girl stood smiling. Every line of her quivering figure spoke\neloquently of her joy in seeing this world through Rawson's eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA man was approaching, a man like the others, yet whose oval face\nstrangely resembled that of the girl. She led Rawson toward him, then\nRawson, stopping, jerked backward in uncontrollable amazement, for the\ntall man drawing near had spoken. His lips were open, moving, and from\nthem came sounds which to Rawson were absolutely unbelievable:\n\n\"Stranger,\" said the newcomer, \"in the name of the Holy Mountain, and\nin the Mountain's language and words, I bid you welcome.\"\n\nAnd Rawson, too stunned for coherent thought, could only stammer in\nwhat was half a shout: \"But you're speaking my language. You're\ntalking the way we talk on earth. Am I crazy? Stark, raving crazy?\"\n\nBut even the sound of the man's voice could not have prepared him for\nwhat followed. There was amazement written on the face of the man. And\nthe girl who stood beside him--her eyes that had been smiling were\nwide and staring in utter fear. Then she and the man and the other\nwhite figures nearby dropped suddenly to kneel humbly before him.\nTheir faces were hidden from him, covered by their hands as they bent\ntheir heads low. He heard the man's voice:\n\n\"He speaks with the tongue of the Mountain! He comes from the Land of\nthe Sun, from Lah-o-tah, at the top of the world! And I, Gor, am\npermitted to hear his voice!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n_The Dance of Death_\n\n\nThrough an airplane's thick windows of shatter-proof glass, so tough\nand resilient that a machine-gun bullet would only make a temporary\ndent, the midday sun flashed brightly as the big ship rolled. Along\neach side of the small room, high up under the curve of the cabin\nroof, windows were ranged. Others like them were in the floor. And,\nabove, the same glass made a transparent dome from which an observer\ncould see on all sides.\n\nOutside was the thunderous roar of ten giant motors, but inside the\ncabin--the fire-control room of a dreadnought of the air--that blast\nof sound became more a reverberation and a trembling than actual\nnoise.\n\nCertainly the sound of motors and of slashing propellers, as the\nbattle plane roared up into the sky, did not prevent free\nconversation among the three men in the room. Yet there was neither\nlaughter nor idle talk.\n\nAt a built-in desk, before a battery of instruments, sat Farrell, the\ncaptain of the ship. Farther aft, in solidly anchored chairs, Colonel\nCulver and Smithy were seated. Occasionally the captain spoke into a\ntransmitter, cutting in by phone on different stations about the ship.\n\n\"Check up on that right-wing gun, Sergeant--number two of the top\nwing-battery. Recoil mechanism is reported stiff.... Tell Chicago,\nLieutenant, we will want one thousand gallons in the air--gas only--no\noil needed.... Gun room? Have the gun crews get some sleep. They'll\nhave to stand by later on....\"\n\nColonel Culver spoke musingly. \"Guerilla warfare, the hardest kind to\nmeet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSmithy nodded absently. He rose and stared from one of the side\nwindows that was just level with his eyes. He could see nothing but\nthe broad expanse of wing, a sheet of smooth gray metal. Along its\nleading edge was a row of shimmering disks where great propellers\nwhirled. From the top of the wing a two-inch Rickert recoilless thrust\nforth its snout; it rose in air till the whole weapon was visible,\nthen settled again and buried itself inside the wing.\n\nThey were testing a gun. Smithy knew that inside that wing section\nwere other guns, and men, and smoothly running motors. The whole ship\nwas only a giant flying wing of which their own central section was\nmerely a thickening.\n\nHe looked down through a bull's-eye in the floor. The city they had\njust left was beneath them. Washington, the nation's capital; the\ngolden dome of the Capitol Building was slipping swiftly astern. Only\nthen did he make a belated reply to Culver's statement.\n\n\"Well,\" he said shortly, \"they'll have to meet it their own way. We\ntold them all we knew. And a lot of good that did--not!\"\n\n\"Five days!\" said Culver. \"It seems more like five years since the\ndevils first came out. Nobody knows where they will hit next. But\nthey're working north--and there's no trouble in telling where they've\nbeen.\"\n\nSmithy's voice was hot in reply, hot with the intense anger of a\nyoung, aggressive man when confronted by the ponderous motion of a big\norganization getting slowly under way.\n\n\"If only we'd gone down underground,\" he exclaimed; \"carried the fight\nto them! They live there--there must be a whole world underground. We\ncould have carried in power lines, lighting the place as we went\nalong. We could have fought 'em with gas. We'd have paid for it, sure\nwe would, but we'd have given them enough hell to think of down below\nso they wouldn't raise so much of it up above.\n\n\"But no! We had to fight according to the textbooks. And those red\ndevils don't fight that way; they never learned the rules.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Guerilla warfare,\" Colonel Culver repeated. \"There are certain\ndifficulties about fighting enemies you can't see.\"\n\n\"They're clever,\" Smithy admitted. \"We taught them their lesson down\nthere in the desert--they've never been seen in daylight since. Out at\nnight--and their invisible heat-rays setting fire to a city a mile\naway, then mopping up with their green flame-throwers if anyone's\nleft. They pick our planes out of the sky even when they're flying\nwithout lights. Darkness means nothing to them! It was murder to send\ntroops in against them, troops wiped out to a man! Artillery--that's\nno good either when we don't know how many of the devils there are, or\nwhere they are. There's no profit in shelling the place when the\nbrutes have gone back underground.\"\n\nColonel Culver shot a warning glance from Smithy to the seated\nofficer. \"About a hundred square miles of the finest fruit country on\nearth laid waste,\" he admitted gravely; then sought to turn Smithy\nfrom his rebellious mood:\n\n\"What's underground, I wonder? Must be a world of caves. Or perhaps\nthese mole-men can follow up a mere crack or a fault line and open it\nout with their flame-throwers to make a tunnel they can go through.\"\n\nThe plane's captain had caught Culver's glance. \"Speak your piece,\" he\nsaid pleasantly. \"Don't stop on my account. There's a lot to what Mr.\nSmith says--but you don't know all that's going on.\"\n\nHe had been half turned. Now he swung about in his little swivel\nchair, whose base was riveted solidly to the floor and whose safety\nbelt ends dangled as he turned.\n\n\"My orders are to deliver you two gentlemen at San Francisco. But\nthere's a show scheduled for to-night down south of there--two hundred\nplanes, big and little, scouts, cruisers, battle planes. They're going\nto swarm in over when the enemy makes his first crack. There's a devil\nof a storm in the mountains along the route we would usually take. I'm\nafraid I'll have to swing off south.\" He was grinning openly as he\nturned back to his desk.\n\nColonel Culver smiled back. \"Attaboy!\" he said.\n\nBut Smithy's forehead was still wrinkled in scowling lines as he\nwalked forward to an adjoining room. \"Underground,\" he was thinking.\n\"We've got to carry the fight to them; got to lick 'em so they'll stay\nlicked. But Rawson--good old Dean--we're too late to help him. And the\nlives of all the devils left in hell can't pay for that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSmithy had been dozing. The shrill whistle of a high-pitched siren\nbrought him fully awake in an instant. Culver, too, sprang alertly to\nhis feet. Both men knew the signal was the call to quarters.\n\nThey had spread blankets on the floor of the fire-control room. Culver\nimmediately folded his into a compact bundle, and Smithy followed\nsuit, as he said: \"That's right; we don't want any feather beds flying\naround here in case of a mix-up.\"\n\nEven Culver's simple act of stowing the blankets back in their little\ncompartment thrilled him with what it portended. His nerves were\nsuddenly aquiver with anticipation. A real fight! A determined effort!\nNo telling what these big dreadnoughts could do. Two hundred, big and\nlittle, Captain Farrell had said. If they could catch the enemy out in\nthe open, show him up in a blaze of enormous flares....\n\nCaptain Farrell was calling them. A section of the floor had been\nraised up mysteriously to form a platform beneath the shallow dome of\nthe conning tower. Farrell was there, headphones clamped to his ears,\none hand on the little switchboard at the base of the glass dome that\nkept him in touch with every station on the ship. Beside him was the\nfire-control officer similarly equipped, though his headphone was\nconnected only with the gun crews.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The enemy's out!\" said Captain Farrell. \"And not just where they were\nexpected--they're raising fourteen kinds of hell. The ships have been\nordered in. I'm hooked up with the radio room now. They're less than a\nhundred miles ahead. Of course we won't mix in on it, but I thought it\nbest to have my men standing by.\"\n\nHe pressed a little lever on his switchboard and spoke into the\nmouthpiece of his head-set. \"Pilot room? Our two passengers, Colonel\nCulver and Mr. Smith, are coming forward. Let them see whatever they\ncan of the show.\"\n\nHe gave the two a quick smile and a nod and waved them forward with\nthe binoculars in his free hand. \"It will be 'lights out' after you\nget there. We'll be flying dark except for wing and tail lights up on\ntop. The enemy's movements are uncertain; perhaps he can see us\nanyway, but we won't advertise ourselves to him.\"\n\nThe ship's bow was a blunt, rounded nose of glass, cut by cross bars\nof aluminum alloy. That deeper central portion of the big flying wing\nwas carried ten feet forward; it was but one of many details that\nSmithy had looked at with interest when he had seen the ship waiting\nfor them on the field.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe pilot room was dark when they entered. Only the glow from the\ninstrument panel showed the two men who were seated behind the wheel\ncontrols. One of them turned and nodded a welcome.\n\n\"Can't offer you gentlemen seats,\" he said, \"but if you'll stand right\nhere behind us you can see the whole works.\" He did not wait for a\nreply, but turned back toward the black night ahead.\n\nSmithy glanced past him at the lighted instruments and found the\naltimeter. Twelve thousand--yes, there was nasty country hereabouts.\nThen he, too, stared out into the dark at the sky sprinkled with\nstars, at the vague blur of an unlighted world far below, and off at\neither side and behind them the quivering lines of cold light where\nstarlight was reflected dimly from the spinning propellers.\n\nOther wing lights winked out as he watched, and he knew that from that\nmoment on, they were invisible from below--invisible to human eyes at\nleast--that they were sweeping on through the darkness like some\ngargantuan night bird pursuing its prey.\n\n\"Flares ahead, sir,\" one of the pilots had spoken into the mouthpiece\nof his telephone, spoken lightly, reporting back to Captain Farrell.\nThe words whipped Smithy's head about, and he, too, saw on a distant\nhorizon, the beginning of a white glare.\n\nThey were fighting there--two hundred planes roaring downward, one\nformation following another. In his mind he was seeing it so plainly.\n\nThe white blaze of light dead ahead grew broader. It had not been as\nfar distant as he had first thought, and the scene that he had\npictured came swiftly to reality.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTheir own ship was still at the twelve-thousand-foot level. Ahead, and\nfive thousand feet below, tiny lights, red and white and green, lights\nwhose swift motion made their hundreds seem like thousands instead,\nwere weaving intricate patterns in the night. The flying lights of the\nfighting planes were on for the planes' own protection; and, too, no\nfurther concealment was possible in the glare that shone upward from\nbelow.\n\nSettling downward were balls of blinding fire, flares dropped by the\nsquadron of scout planes that had torn through in advance. They\nlighted brilliantly a valley which, a few hours before, had been one\nof many like it--square fields, dark green with the foliage of fruit\ntrees, straight lines of crossing roads, houses, and off in the\ndistance a little city.\n\nAnd now the valley was an inferno of spouting flame. That city was a\nvast, roaring furnace under smoke clouds of mingled blood-red and\nblack. The valley floor was a place of desolation, of drifting smoke\nand of flashing shell-bursts as the fleet swept in above.\n\nThe myriad lights of the planes had drawn into a circle, a great\nwhirlpool of lines that revolved above a mile-wide section of that\nvalley.\n\nBeside Smithy a wheel control was moving. He clung to the pilot's seat\nas their own plane banked and nosed downward. And now he shouted aloud\nto Culver:\n\n\"The mole-men! There they are! Thousands of them!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was pointing between the two pilots as their own plane swept down.\nHe could see them plainly now, clotted masses of dark figures surging\nfrenziedly to and fro. For an instant he saw them--then that part of\nthe world where they had been was a seething inferno of bursting bombs\nand shells.\n\nBeside him Colonel Culver spoke quietly: \"Caught them cold! That's\nhanding it to them.\"\n\nTheir own plane had leveled off. With motors throttled they were\ndrifting slowly past, only a thousand feet higher than the circling\nplanes just off at one side. Culver's quiet tones rose to a hoarse\nshout: \"The ships! My God, they're falling!\"\n\nHis wild cry ended in a gasp. Beside him Smithy, in breathless horror,\nlike Culver, was staring at that whirlpool of tiny lights that had\ngone suddenly from smooth circular motion into frenzied confusion, or\nvanished in the yellow glare of exploding gas tanks. The light of\ntheir own white flares picked them out in ghastly clarity as they\nfell.\n\nStraight, vertical lines of yellow were burning planes. Again they\nmade horrible zigzag darts and flashed down into view torn and\nhelpless, while others, tens and scores of others with crumpled wings,\njoined the mad dance of death.\n\nSmithy knew that he could never tear his eyes away from the sight. Yet\nwithin him something was clamoring for his attention. \"They didn't do\nit from below!\" that something was shouting. \"Not down in that hell.\nThere are more of them somewhere.\" Then somehow, he forced his eyes to\nstare ahead and outside of that circle of fearful fascination and he\nknew that for an instant he was seeing a single stab of green flame.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne single light on the darkness of a little knoll that stood close\nbeside this place of white flame and destruction. One light--and in\nthe valley there had flashed a million brighter. It had shone but an\ninstant, but, to Smithy, watching, it was the same he had seen when\ntheir own camp was attacked. And now it was Smithy who was abruptly\nstone cold.\n\nOne hand closed upon a pilot's shoulder with a grip of steel; his\nother pointed. \"Down there--they're hiding back of that hill, picking\noff our ships from the side.\" And then, like a guiding beacon, a point\nof green showed once more.\n\nThe plane banked sharply while one of the pilots spoke crisp, clearly\nenunciated words into his phone. He listened; then: \"Right!\" he\nsnapped. \"Power dive for bow-gun firing. Level off for bombing from\nfive hundred feet.\"\n\nOff into the night they were headed. Then a left bank and turn brought\nthe place of blazing flares and falling planes swinging smoothly into\nview; they were flying toward it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgainst the white glare in the valley of death was a hill, roundly\noutlined. Then the ship's nose sank heavily down; and, from each broad\nwing, in straight, forward-stabbing lines, was the steady lightning of\nthe Rickert batteries in action.\n\nThe pilot's room was a place of unbearable sound. The crash of\ngunfire, it seemed, must crush the glass wall like an eggshell by the\nsheer impact of its own thunder. In that pandemonium Smithy never knew\nwhen they flattened out. He knew only that the hill ahead twinkled\nbrilliantly, and that each flashing light was an exploding shell. He\nknew when the hill passed beneath them.\n\nThen, in the night, close beside them and just outside the pilot-room\nglass, was a quick glow of red. The plane lurched and staggered.\nSmithy clung desperately to the seat ahead. The pilot was fighting\nmadly with the wheel. The roar of bombs from astern, where the bombers\nhad launched their missiles at the approaching hill, was unheard. In a\nworld suddenly gone chaotic he could hear nothing. He knew only that\nthe valley dead ahead was whirling dizzily--that it sank suddenly from\nsight.\n\nThey were crashing. That red glow--they had been hit. Then something\nhard and firm was pressing against him, pressing irresistibly. It was\nthe last conscious impression upon Smithy's mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n_The Voice of the Mountain_\n\n\nIn a strange new world surrounded by a group of kneeling figures of\nwhom one, who called himself Gor, had spoken in Rawson's own tongue,\nDean Rawson stood silent. It was all too overwhelming. He could not\nbring words together to formulate a reply. He only stood and stared\nwith wondering eyes at the exquisite beauty of the world about him, a\nworld flooded with a golden light, faintly tinged with green. Then he\nlooked above him to see the source of that light and found the sun.\n\nNot the sun that he had known, but a flaming ball nevertheless.\nStraight above it hung, in the center of the heavens, a gleaming disk\nof pale-green gold, magnificently brilliant. He saw it through lids\nhalf closed against its glare. Then his gaze swept back down the blue\nvault of the heavens, back to a world of impossible beauty.\n\nDirectly ahead was a land of desolation, radiant in its barrenness.\nFor every rock, every foot of ground, was made of crystal. Nearby\nhills were visions of loveliness where the colors of a million\nrainbows quivered and flashed. Veins of metal showed the rich blues\nand greens of peacock coloring. Others were scarlet, topaz, green, and\nall of them took the strange sunlight that flooded them and threw it\nback in blendings radiant and delicate.\n\nThe little hills began a short distance off, two low ranges running\ndirectly away. One on either side, they made brilliant walls for the\nflat valley between, whose foreground was barren rock of rose and\nwhite. But beyond the glistening barren stretch were green fields of\nluxuriant vegetation and in the distance, nestled in the green were\nclustered masses that might have been a city of men. Still farther on,\na single mountain peak, white beyond belief, reared its graceful\nsweeping sides to a shining apex against the heavens of clear blue.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly Rawson turned. A hundred yards away, at his left, there was\nwater, a sea whose smooth rollers might have been undulating liquid\nemeralds that broke to infinite flashing gems upon the shore. He\nswung sharply to the right and found the same expanse of water,\nperhaps the same distance away.\n\nThen he turned toward the shell, which had been behind him and the\nshaft from which it had emerged, and into which the air was driving\nwith a ceaseless rushing sound. Now, looking beyond them, he found the\nsame ocean; he was standing on a blunt point of rock projecting into\nthe sea. The rest of this world was one vast expanse of water.\n\nSuddenly Rawson knew that it was unlike any ocean of earth. Instead of\nfinishing on a sharply-cut horizon, that sea of emerald green reached\nout and still out, and _up_! It did not fall away. It curved upward,\nuntil it lost itself in the distance and merged with the blue of the\nsky. It was the same on all sides.\n\nHe swung slowly back to face the land that perhaps was only an island.\nThe kneeling ones had raised their bowed heads. They were regarding\nhim from shining, expectant eyes. Only the girl kept her face averted.\nRawson spoke to none of them; the exclamations that his amazement and\ndismay wrung from his lips were meant for himself.\n\n\"It's concave! It curves upward! I'm on the inside of the world! And\nthat sun is the center! But what holds us here? What keeps us from\nfalling?\" He passed one hand heavily across his eyes. The excitement\nof the moment had lifted him above the weariness of muscle and mind.\nNow fatigue claimed him.\n\n\"Sleep,\" he said dully. \"I've got to sleep. I've got to. I'm all in.\"\n\nGor was beside him in an instant. \"Whatever you wish is yours,\" he\npromised.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRawson was to remember little of that journey toward the habitations\nof this people. Gor had spoken at times along the way: \"... the Land\nof the Central Sun.... The People of the Light, peaceful and happy in\nour little world....\"\n\nRawson had roused himself to ask: \"Who it at the head of it? Who is\nthe king, the ruler?\"\n\nAnd the tall man beside him had answered humbly: \"Always since the\nbeginning one named Gor has led. My father, and those who came before\nhim; now it is I. And when I have gone, my little son will take the\nname of Gor.\"\n\nHe had glanced toward the girl and his voice had dropped into the\nsoft, liquid syllables of their own tongue. She had smiled back at\nGor, though her eyes persistently refused to meet those of Rawson.\n\nAgain Gor spoke in words that Rawson could understand.\n\n\"I think at times,\" he said, \"it is my daughter Loah, my little\nLoah-San who really rules. I, knowing not who you were, did not\napprove of this expedition, but Loah insisted. She had seen you,\nand--\" A glance from the girl cut him short.\n\nThe words lingered in Rawson's mind when he awoke. The horrible\nexperience of the past days were no longer predominant. Even his own\nworld seemed of a dim and distant past.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe awoke refreshed. He was in a new world and, for the moment, he\nasked nothing except to explore its mystery. He bathed under a\nfountain in an adjoining room, and grinned broadly as he wrapped the\nfolds of the long golden loin cloth about him.\n\n\"As well be dead as out of style,\" he quoted. \"And now to find Gor and\nLoah, and see what the devil all this is about--a talking mountain and\na buried race that speaks first-rate American.\"\n\nGor was waiting for him in a room whose translucent walls admitted a\nsubdued glow from outside. There was food on a table, strange fruits,\nand a clear scarlet liquid in a crystal glass. Rawson ate ravenously,\nthen followed Gor.\n\nOutside were houses, whose timbered frames of jet-black contrasted\nstartlingly with the quartz walls they enclosed. The street was\nthronged with people who drew back to let them pass, and who dropped\nto their knees in humble worship. Like Gor, the men wore only the loin\ncloth, but for this gala day, that simple apparel added a note of\nflashing color. The long cloths wrapped about their hips, and brought\nup and about the waist where the ends hung free, were brilliant with\ncountless variations of crimson and blue and gold. The same rainbow\nhues were found in the loose folded cloths that draped themselves like\nshort skirts from the women's waists. Here and there, in the sea of\nwhite bodies and scintillant jeweled breast-plates, was one with an\nadditional flash of color, where brilliant silken scarves had been\nthrown about the shoulders of the younger girls.\n\n\"From all the land,\" said Gor, \"they have come to do you honor.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHardly more than a village, this cluster of strangely beautiful\nshelters for the People of the Light. Beyond, Rawson saw the country,\npastures where animals, weird and strange, were cropping the grass so\nvividly green; fields of growing things; little crystal houses like\nfanciful, glistening toys that had miraculously grown to greater size.\nThe dwellings were sprinkled far into the distance across the\nlandscape. Beyond them was the base of the mountain, magnificent and\nglorious in its crystal purity of white, and the striations, vertical\nand diagonal, that flashed brilliantly with black jet and peacock\ngreen.\n\nRawson knew them for mineral intrusions, and knew that the mountain\nwas only one crystalline mass of all the quartz formation that made of\nthe world's inner core a gigantic geode, gleaming in eternal\nbrilliance under the glow of the central sun. And still, in it all,\nDean Rawson had seen a lack without which perfection could not be\ncomplete.\n\n\"Where is Loah?\" he asked of Gor. \"I thought--I had hoped....\"\n\nSomething in Gor's face told Rawson that his companion was troubled.\n\"She refused to come,\" he said. \"But the wish of one of the great ones\nfrom the Land of the Sun is a command.\" He shouted an order before\nRawson could put in a protest. A man darted away.\n\n\"Always happy, my little Loah-San,\" said Gor. His eyes held a puzzled\nlook. \"Always until now. And now she weeps and will not say why. Come,\nwe will walk more slowly. There were questions you wished to ask. I\nwill answer them as we walk.\"\n\n\"Questions?\" exclaimed Rawson. \"A thousand of them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd now for the first time since, at the top of a barren peak, in the\ndark of the desert night, his wild journey had begun, he found\nanswers, definite and precise, to the puzzles he had been unable to\nsolve.\n\nTheir speech--their language--how was it they could talk with him? He\nfired the questions out with furious eagerness, and Gor replied.\n\nAs to their speech--the Holy Mountain itself would explain. And yes,\ntruly, this was the center of the world, or the sun above them was.\nThe central sun did not attract, but instead repelled all matter from\nit--all things but one, the sun-stone, of which Gor would speak\nlater.\n\nRawson pounced upon that and demanded corroboration.\n\n\"All the power of earth tends to draw every object to its center, yet\nwe're here on an inner surface. We're walking actually head down. And\nour bodies, every stone, every particle of matter, ought by well-known\nlaws to fall into that flaming center. But we don't! That proves your\npoint--proves a counter gravitation. Then there must be a neutral\nzone. A place where this upward thrust is exactly equalled by\ngravity's downward pull.\n\n\"The zone of fire,\" said Gor. \"You passed through it. Did you not\nsee?\"\n\n\"Saw it and felt it!\" Rawson's mind leaped immediately to the next\nquestion.\n\n\"And we must have come through it at, surely, a thousand miles an\nhour. What drove us? That shell must have gone in from here. I can\nunderstand its falling one way, but not two. We should have come to\nrest in that very spot--and we'd have lasted about half a second if we\nhad.\"\n\n\"Oro and Grah,\" said Gor. \"Oro, the sun-stone, and Grah, the\nstone-that-loves-the-dark. But they are not stones, neither are they\nmetal. We find them deep in the ground, clinging to the caves. A fine\npowder, both of them.\"\n\n\"Still I don't get it,\" said Rawson. \"You drive that shell in from\nhere, and then you drive it back again.\"\n\n\"That, too, I will explain later. It is simple; even the Dwellers in\nthe Dark--those whom you call the mole-men--have Oro and Grah to serve\nthem.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGor launched into a long account of their tribal legends, of that time\nin the long ago when an angry sun god had driven his children inside\nthe earth; of how Gor, and the son of Gor, and his son's sons tried\nalways to return.\n\nRawson was listening only subconsciously. They were circling the white\nmountain, ascending its lower slope. Now he could see beyond it as far\nas the land extended, and he was startled to find this distance so\nshort. They were on an island, ten miles or so in length, and beyond\nit was the sea; he must ask Gor about that.\n\n\"It is all that is left,\" said Gor, when Rawson interrupted his\nnarrative. \"Once the land was great and the sea small--this also in\nthe long ago--but always it has risen. The air we breathe and the\nwater in the sea come from the central sun. The air rushes out, as you\nknow; the water has no place to retreat.\"\n\nAgain he took up his tale, but Rawson's eyes were following the upward\ncurve of that sea. They, seemed to be in the bottom of a great bowl;\nhe was trying to estimate, trying to gage distance.\n\n\"... and so, after many generations had lived and died, they found the\nPathway to the Light,\" Gor was saying. \"It is our name for the shaft\nthrough which you came. This was thousands of your years ago, when he\nwho was then Gor, and the bravest of the tribe, descended. Even then\nthey were workers in metal and they knew of Oro and Grah. They were\nour fathers, the first People of the Light.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRawson had a question ready on his tongue, but Gor's words suggested\nanother. \"That shaft,\" he said, \"the Pathway to the Light--do you mean\nit extends clear up to the mole-men's world? Why don't they come\ndown?\"\n\n\"To them the way is lost; the Pathway is closed above the zone of\nfire. That other Gor did that. And those who remained--the\nmole-men--have forgotten. They could break their way through if they\nknew--they are master-workers with fire--but for them the Pathway\nends, and below is the great heat. But we know of a way around the\nclosed place, the hidden way to the great Lake of Fire.\"\n\n\"They could break their way through if they knew!\" repeated Rawson\nsoftly. For an instant he stood silent and unbreathing; he was\nremembering the ugly eyes in a priest's hideous face. The eyes were\nwatching him as the White Ones took him away.\n\nHe forced his thoughts to come back to the earlier question. \"What,\"\nhe asked, \"is the diameter, the distance across the inside world? How\nfar is it from here to your sun? How many miles?\"\n\n\"Miles?\" questioned Gor. \"We know the word, for the Mountain has told\nus, but the length of a mile we could not know. This I can say: there\nwere wise men in the past when our own world was larger. They worked\nmagic with little marks on paper. It is said that they knew that if\none came here from our sun and kept on as far again through the solid\nrock, he would reach the outside--the land, of the true sun, from\nwhich our forefathers came.\"\n\nRawson nodded his head, while his eyes followed that sweeping green\nbowl of the sea. \"Not far off,\" he said abstractedly. \"Two thousand\nmiles radius--and the earth itself not a solid ball, but a big\nglobular shell two thousand miles thick. I could rig up a level, I\nsuppose; work out an approximation of the curvature.\"\n\nFrom the smooth winding path which they had followed there sounded\nbehind them hurrying footsteps; a moment later Loah stood beside him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer eyes gave unmistakable corroboration of what Gor had said of that\ntorrent of tears, but she looked at Dean bravely, while every show of\nemotion was erased from her face. \"You sent for me,\" she said.\n\nAnd Rawson, though now he knew he could speak to her and be\nunderstood, found himself at a loss for words.\n\n\"We wanted you with us, Gor and I,\" he began, then paused. She was so\ndifferent from the girl whose smiling eyes had welcomed him. The\nchange had come when he spoke those first words on his arrival, and\nnow she was so coldly impersonal.\n\n\"I wanted to thank you. You saved my life; you were so brave, so....\"\nAgain he hesitated; he wanted to tell her how dear, how utterly\nlovely, she had seemed.\n\n\"It was nothing; it has pleased me to do it,\" she said quietly, then\nwalked on ahead while the others followed. But Rawson knew that that\nslim body was tense with repressed emotion. He had not realized how he\nhad looked forward to seeing again that welcoming light in her eyes.\nHe was still puzzling over the change as they entered a natural cave\nin the mountainside.\n\nA winding passage showed between sheer walls of snow white, where\ngiant crystals had parted along their planes of cleavage. Then the\npassage grew dark, but he could see that ahead of them it opened to\nform a wider space. There were lights on the walls of the room, lights\nlike the one that Loah had carried. And on the floor were rows of\ntables where men were busy at work, writing endlessly on long scrolls\nof parchment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The Wise Ones,\" Gor was saying. \"Servants of the Holy Mountain.\" Yet\neven then men knelt at Rawson's coming as had the other more humble\npeople. They then returned to their tables, and in that crystal\nmountain was only the sound of their scratching pens and the faint\nsigh of a breeze that blew in through a hidden passage to furnish\nventilation.\n\nYet there were some at those tables whose pens did not move; they\nseemed to be waiting expectantly. One of them spoke. \"The time is\nnear,\" he said. \"Are the Servants prepared?\"\n\nAnd the waiting ones answered: \"We are prepared.\"\n\nRawson glanced sharply about. \"What hocus-pocus is this?\" he was\nasking himself. Still the silence persisted. He looked at the waiting\nmen, motionless, their heads bent, their hands ready above the\nparchment scrolls. He saw again the white walls, the single broad band\nof some glittering metal that made a continuous black stripe around\nwalls and ceiling and floor.\n\n\"What kind of ore is that?\" he was asking himself silently. \"It's\nmetallic; it runs right through the mountain. I wonder--\"\n\nHis idle thoughts were never finished. A ripping crash like the\ncrackle of lightning in the vaulted room! Then a voice--the mountain\nitself was speaking--speaking in words whose familiar accent brought a\nsob into his throat.\n\n\"Station K-twenty-two-A,\" said the voice of the mountain, \"the\nsuper-power station of the Radio-news Service at Los Angeles,\nCalifornia.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It's tuned in!\" gasped Rawson. \"Tuned in on the big L. A. station! A\ngigantic crystal detector! Those heavy laminations of imbedded metal\nfurnish the inductance.\" Then his incoherent words ended--the mountain\nwas speaking.\n\n\"Radiopress dispatch: The invasion of the mole-men has not been\nchecked. Army Air Force fought a terrific engagement about midnight,\nlast night, and met defeat. Over one hundred fighting planes were\nbrought down in flames. Even the new battle-plane type, the latest\ndreadnoughts of the air, succumbed.\n\n\"Heavy loss of life, although civilian population of three towns had\nbeen evacuated before the mole-men destroyed them. Gordon Smith is\nreported killed. Smith was associated with Dean Rawson in the Tonah\nBasin where the mole-men first appeared. With Colonel Culver of the\nCalifornia National Guard, Smith was returning from Washington in an\nArmy dreadnought which crashed back of the enemy's lines.\"\n\nRawson's tanned face had gone white; he knew the others were looking\nat him curiously, all but the men at the tables whose pens were flying\nfuriously across the waiting scrolls. Before him the face of Loah,\nsuddenly wide-eyed and troubled, swam dizzily. He could scarcely see\nit--he was seeing other sights of another world.\n\n\"They're out,\" he half whispered. \"The red devils are out--and\nSmithy--Smithy's gone!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n_Taloned Hands_\n\n\nSimple, pastoral folk, the People of the Light! In their inner world,\na vanishing world, where nearly all of what once had been a vast\ncountry was now covered by the steadily encroaching sea, they had\nresisted the degeneration which might easily have followed the\ndestruction of a complex civilization. Living simply, and clean of\nmind, they had clung to the culture of the past as it was taught them\nby their Wise Ones. And now the People of the Light had found a new\ngod.\n\nNot that Dean Rawson had asked for that exalted position; on the\ncontrary he had tried his best to make them understand that he was\nonly one of many millions, some better, some worse, but all of them\nmerely humans.\n\nHis speaking the language of the holy mountain had convinced them\nfirst. But when old Rotan, oldest and grayest of the mountain's\nservants, went into a trance, then Rawson could no longer escape the\nhonors being thrust upon him.\n\n\"The time of deliverance is at hand,\" old Rotan said when he awoke.\nHis voice that so long had been cracked and feeble was suddenly\nstrong, vibrant with belief in the visions that had come to him.\n\nThey were in the inner chamber of the white mountain, where Dean\nRawson, heartsick, lonely and hopeless, had spent most of his time\nlistening to the voice from the outer world. Gor was there, and Loah;\nand the writers had left their desks to gather around old Rotan, where\nnow the old servant of the mountain stood erect, his glistening eyes\nfixed unwaveringly upon Rawson.\n\n\"Listen,\" he commanded. \"Rotan speaks the truth. Never shall the\nPeople of the Light return to the outer world; it is here we stay. For\nnow our world which is lost shall be returned to us.\" His eyes,\nunnaturally bright, met the wondering gaze of his own people gathered\naround, then came back to rest again upon Rawson.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Dean--Rah--Sun!\" he said. \"'Rah'--do you not see? It is our own word,\nRah--the Messenger! Dean--Messenger of the Sun! The sun-god has sent\nhim--he will set us free. He will restore our lost cities. The People\nof the Light will spread out to fill the new land; they will multiply,\nand once more will be a mighty nation, living happily as of old in\ntheir own lost world.\n\n\"Dean!\" he called. \"Dean--Messenger of the Sun!\" He was drawn to his\nfull frail height, his arms outstretched. But Rawson saw the old eyes\nclose, sensed the first slackening of that tense body; it was he who\nsprang and caught the sagging figure in his arms, then lowered the\nlifeless body to the floor of crystal white.\n\nEven happiness can kill. A feeble heart can cease to beat under the\nstress of emotions too beautiful to be borne. And Rotan, wisest of the\nwise, had passed on to serve his sun-god in another world.\n\nAnd thereafter, Rawson, Dean-Rah-Sun, was undeniably a god. But he\nwondered, even then, while the others dropped to their knees in humble\nworship, why Loah, her eyes brimming over with tears, had broken\nsuddenly into uncontrollable sobs and had rushed blindly, swiftly,\nfrom the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo Rawson the unwavering, simple faith of the White Ones was only an\nadded misery. Rotan's vision was accepted by them unquestioningly;\ntheir adoring eyes followed Rawson wherever he went, while the\nchildren carpeted his path to the holy mountain with golden flowers.\n\nAnd there Rawson would sit, cursing silently his own helplessness,\nwhile the voice of the mountain told of further devastation up above.\nHis plans for leading a force against the mole-men were abandoned. On\nthe island, all that was left of this inner world, were only some two\nthousand persons, men, women and children. And the children were few;\nthe population had been rigorously kept down. Their present number was\nall that the island would support, though every possible foot of\nground was tilled.\n\n\"Only a handful of them,\" Rawson admitted despondently, \"and not a\nweapon of any sort. They've kept by themselves. Only Loah and a few\nof the others had enough curiosity and nerve to scout around where the\nmole-men live. She even understands their talk! Lord, what I'd give\nfor a thousand like her, a thousand men with her nerve! Then, with\nweapons, and means of transportation....\" But at that he stopped,\naware of the futility of all such thoughts.\n\nHe had tried to talk to Gor, tried to tell him of his own limitations.\nAnd Gor had only smiled pleasantly and repeated \"Rotan has spoken. It\nwill come to pass!\"\n\nCeaselessly his thoughts revolved about the hopelessness of his\nsituation. He was alone. Whatever was to be done he must do\nsingle-handed--and there was nothing he could do! But he would not\nadmit to himself that the aching loneliness came to a focus in the\nmemory of a girl's smiling eyes, the touch of her soft hand.\n\n\"They're fighting up there,\" he argued, \"fighting for their lives, and\nI can't help. What right have I to think of Loah or myself?\" In spite\nof which he sprang abruptly to his feet, left the mountain and the\nvoice of the mountain behind him, and went in search of the girl.\n\n\"I've got to make her understand,\" he exclaimed. \"I've got to have\nsomeone to talk to. But I can't make her out. She's so confoundedly\nrespectful--acts as if I were a little tin god. And yet--she wasn't\nalways that way!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the home of Gor he found Loah, slim and beautiful as always. She\nhad just come from the bath. The creamy texture of her skin had\nflushed to rosiness in the cold fountain. Her jeweled breast-plates\nsparkled. A cloth that shone like silk enwrapped her hips in soft\nfolds of pale rose and hung in an absurd little skirt. She might have\nbeen the spirit of youth itself, a vision of loveliness; yet Rawson\nfelt an almost uncontrollable desire to take her in his two hands and\nshake her when she bowed humbly and treated his request as if it were\na royal command.\n\n\"To walk with Dean-Rah-Sun! But certainly, if that is his wish!\"\n\nIn silence they left the village and walked toward the island's end\nwhere Rawson had emerged from the under-world.\n\nThe island was not large. On either side were low hills, mere knolls,\nof white crystal, where, in every hollow, men and women were\nharvesting strange grain. Between the two ranges of hills were flat\nfields of green, reaching out toward the point some three miles\ndistant.\n\nRawson made no attempt to talk as he led Loah along the roadway that\ncleft the green expanse in half. Other workers were there, and Dean\nacknowledged their smiling, worshipful salutations. He did not want to\ntalk now; he wanted to find some place where he and Loah could be by\nthemselves. There was so much he must tell her. He must try to make\nher understand. And after that, perhaps, with her help, he could find\nsome way to be of aid to his own beleaguered people--something he\ncould do even single-handed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhere the fields ended, and from there on toward the point, had been\nan expanse of glistening white. Rawson remembered it plainly. So now,\nwhen he found it a place of flaming crimson, he stared in amazement.\nAcross the full width of the valley a brilliant carpet had spread\nitself, a covering of flowers. A blossoming vine had sprung up in the\nfew days since his arrival and had woven a thick mat of vegetation.\n\nHe wanted to go on out to the extreme end of the point. There they\nwould be alone. But Loah objected when he started to enter the red\nexpanse.\n\n\"No!\" she said in quick alarm. \"We must not cross. It is the Place of\nDeath. We will go around it, following the hills.\"\n\n\"We crossed it the other day when it was a plain of white salt,\"\nargued Rawson.\n\n\"But now the flowers have come. Even now it might be safe--but when\nthey die then nothing can cross here and live.\"\n\nLoah could not give the reason. Dean gathered from what she could tell\nthat a gas of some sort was formed, perhaps by the decomposing\nvegetation. Perhaps it combined with the sparkling white shale. But\nall this was of no consequence compared with his own problems. He did\nnot argue the matter but followed where Loah led.\n\n\"Where is the shell?\" he asked, when they stood at last near the open\nmouth of the great shaft into which the air was rushing. \"Where is the\nmachine that we came here in? I wanted to see it--thought perhaps I\ncould use it later on.\n\n\"The jana--the shell, as you call it--is safely locked in a great room\nof Gor's house. Not all understand its use; it must be kept away from\ncareless hands.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen Rawson put that thought aside. He took Loah's hand and led her\nsome distance away toward the shore. Beyond a rocky, crystalline mass,\nwhere fragments had been heaped, the sound of the rushing air was\nlost; only the flashing emerald waves whispered softly on the shore\nbeyond. And there in that quiet place, under the brilliance of the\ncentral sun, Rawson told her of himself and of the great outer world.\nHe told her of his work, of everything that had happened, of how he\nwas only one of many millions of men and women like, and yet unlike,\nthe People of the Light. And at last he knew that she understood.\n\nHe had spoken softly, though he knew there were no other listening\nears. Loah had been seated before him on one of the white blocks. She\nrose to her feet. Her eyes were troubled. Vaguely he sensed behind\nthem a conflict of emotions.\n\n\"I must think,\" she said. \"I will walk by myself for a time; then I\nwill return.\"\n\nRawson reached for her hand. \"You're a good sport,\" he said huskily.\nThen he felt the trembling of that hand in his; and, as if it had been\nan electric current, his own body responded.\n\nShaken in every nerve, his poise deserted him. He could not think\nclearly. He knew only that that horrible loneliness was somehow gone.\nBy force of will alone he kept his arms from reaching out toward that\nradiant figure. Instead, he raised her hand toward his lips.\n\nShe withdrew it sharply. \"No,\" she said, \"our Wise Ones were mistaken.\nFor years they have listened to the mountain; they have written down\nits words. Slowly they have learned their meaning. A kiss, they said,\nwas a symbol of love in your world. They were mistaken--as was I. Now\nI will walk alone for a time.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRawson let her go. She seemed hardly looking where she went; her eyes\nwere downcast. She moved slowly around the sheltering rock and on\ntoward the level ground and the rushing winds of the shaft.\n\nHis own thoughts were in a whirl, too confused with emotion for clear\nthinking. \"A symbol of love!\" And back there in that cave world she\nhad pressed her lips to his hand. Then they had come here, and he had\nbeen transformed to a god, a being who could never have more than an\nimpersonal affection for one as humble as she.\n\nThe rising flood of happiness within him was abruptly frozen, changed\nto something which filled his veins with ice. For, from beyond the\ncrystal barrier that hid Loah from his view, her voice had come in one\nsingle cry of terror. Then, \"Dean!\" she called. \"Dean San!\" But by\nthen, Rawson was throwing himself madly around the barricade of rocks.\n\nLike a sensitized plate when the camera's shutter is opened a merest\nfraction of a second, Rawson's brain took the imprint of every detail\nthat was there. The black mouth of the shaft, and, on the rock beside\nit, something metallic, brilliantly gleaming--a flame-thrower! Beyond\nthe pit was Loah, half crouching, her slim body tense as if checked in\nmid-flight. She had been running toward him, coming to warn him. And\nbetween her and the shaft, his back turned squarely toward Rawson, was\nthe hideous figure of a mole-man, one of the Reds! His grotesque,\npointed head was bent forward toward the girl; his arms were reaching,\nthe long fingers like talons.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRawson did not know when he called the girl's name. But he knew the\ninstant that he had done it and he knew it was a mistake. He should\nhave crept quietly, seized the weapon--and now his feet tore madly on\nthe white rock floor as he raced toward the shining implement of\ndeath. From beyond, the red figure, whirling at his call, leaped\nwildly for the same prize.\n\nThe taloned hands were on the flame-thrower first. Rawson saw the red\nbody straighten, saw the weapon swing, glistening in air, swinging\nover and down. From its tip green fire made a straight line of light.\n\nHe leaped in under the descending flame, felt the nozzle of the\nprojector as it crashed upon his right shoulder and the green fire\nspat harmlessly beyond his back. That last spring had thrown him\nbodily against the red monster. They were both knocked off balance for\na moment, then Rawson caught himself and swung with his left. He set\nhimself in that fraction of a second, felt the first movement of that\nshining, crook-necked tube that meant the green flame was being drawn\nback where it could reach him; then his fist crashed into a yielding\njaw.\n\nNot five feet from the brink of that nearly bottomless shaft he stood\nwavering in the rush of air. He knew that the ugly red figure had\ntoppled sideways, that the weapon had fallen with him, the blast\nswinging upward in a vertical, hissing arc--then man and weapon had\ndropped silently into the pit.\n\nHe was alone, save for the girl, who, her eyes wide with horror, threw\nherself upon him and clung trembling, while she murmured\nincomprehensible endearments in her own tongue wherein his own name\nwas mingled: \"Dean, dear! My own Dean-San!\"\n\nBut the mole-men! Dean Rawson's mind was aghast with the horror of it:\nthe mole-men had now found the way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n_Suicide?_\n\n\nGordon Smith, sometimes known as Smithy, was to remember little of the\nhappenings that followed the crash of the big Army dreadnought. It was\nColonel Culver who dragged him from the pilot-room wreckage, Colonel\nCulver and one of the pilots whom he had restored to consciousness.\nThey lowered Smithy carefully to the ground, then explored the rest of\nthe ship.\n\nTheir hands were red when they returned--and empty. Captain Farrell\nand the rest of the crew had ceased to be units of the United States\nArmy Air Force; henceforth they would be only names on a casualty list\ngrown ominously long.\n\n\"Stood plumb on her tail,\" said the pilot, staring at the wreck. \"They\nhit us just once, and the left wing crumpled like cardboard. Last I\nremember was pulling her up off the trees.\" He stared at the mass of\ntwisted metal and the center section where the wing had torn loose; it\nstood upright, almost vertical, resting on the crushed tail.\n\n\"Funny,\" said the pilot in the same flat, level tone that seemed the\nonly voice he had since that last pull on a whipping wheel. \"Damn\nfunny--mostly we get it first up there.\"\n\n\"Come here!\" snapped Colonel Culver. \"Lend a hand here with Smith;\nwe've got to carry him. And don't talk so loud--those red devils will\nbe out here any minute.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSmithy was taking a more active interest in his surroundings when he\nsat a week later in the Governor's office.\n\n\"There's a detachment moving in there from the south,\" said the\nGovernor. \"We're going to follow your advice, to some extent at least.\nWe're sending troops to Tonah Basin. If the top of that dead crater is\nclosed they will blast it open; then a scouting party's going down.\nCall it a reconnaissance, call it suicide--one name's just as good as\nthe other. Colonel Culver, here, is going. But you know the lay of the\nland there; you could be of great help. How about it?\"\n\n\"Are you asking me?\" Smithy inquired.\n\nHe stood up, flexed his arms, while he grinned at Colonel Culver.\n\"Hinges all greased and working! As a flier, Colonel, you're a darn\ngood first-aid man. I'll say that! When do we start?\"\n\nWhich explains why Smithy, some time later, hidden under the grotesque\ndisguise of a gas mask, was one of fifty, similarly attired, who stood\nwaiting about the black open maw in the great cinder-floored crater of\none of the peaks that surrounded Tonah Basin.\n\nNight. And the big stars that hang so low in the black desert sky\nshould have been brilliant. They were lost now in the white glare that\nstreamed upward. The crater was a fortress. Around the circle of the\nentire rim, on the inner side of the rough crags, men of the 49th\nField Artillery stood by their guns. Lookouts trailed their telephone\nwire to the higher peaks, where they perched as shapeless as huddled\nowls; and, like owls, their eyes swept the mountain's slopes and the\ndesert at its base, where the searchlight crews played long fingers of\nlight incessantly--and where nothing moved.\n\nBut the empty silence of the desert was misleading, as the men in the\ncrater knew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey had begun arriving with the earliest light of morning. Smithy had\ncome in with the first lot. And when the first big auto-gyro transport\nhad settled and risen again from the crater, another had taken its\nplace, and another and many others after that.\n\nThat first crew had been a machine-gun battalion, and Smithy had\nsmiled with grim satisfaction at the unhurried way in which their\nyoung captain had snapped them into position without the loss of a\nsecond. And their guns, Smithy noticed, were trained inward upon the\ncrater itself.\n\nInside that protecting circle the other transports landed one by one:\nmen, mobile artillery, ammunition cases, big searchlights, and a\ndozen engine-generator outfits. The last transports brought in strange\ncargo--short sections of aluminum struts with bolts and splice plates\nto join them together: blocks, and tackle and sheaves; then spools of\nsteel alloy cable at least ten miles in length.\n\nFrom the last ship they took a hoisting engine and an assortment of\naluminum plates and bars which were bolted together by waiting\nmechanics, and which grew magically to a crude but exceedingly\nsubstantial elevator, on which fifty men, by considerable crowding,\ncould stand.\n\nOnly a floor of bolted plates, with corner posts and diagonal bracing\nand a single guard rail running around the four sides--but for the\nfirst time Smithy began to feel that he was actually going down; that\nthis was not all make-believe, or a futile gesture. He would stand on\nthat platform; he would go down where Dean had gone. And then.... But\nwhat would come after he knew he could never imagine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA little crane swung the first metal work into position above the\nshaft. One end of the assembled framework of aluminum alloy dragged\nloosely on the ground; the other end swung out and projected above the\nshaft, swayed for an instant--and then came the first direct knowledge\nof the enemy's presence. The end of a metal strut, though nothing\nvisible was touching it, grew suddenly white hot, sagged, then broke\ninto a shower of molten, dazzling drops that rained down into the pit.\n\n\"Good,\" said Colonel Culver, who was standing beside Smithy. \"Now we\nknow they are there--but it means we will have to go down there with\nour gas masks on.\"\n\nTo Smithy it was not immediately apparent how gas masks were to\nprotect them from the deadly invisible ray. He got the connection of\nthoughts when a bomb was slid over the edge. The dull thud of the\nexplosion quickly came back to them.\n\n\"They popped that one off in the air--hit it with their heat ray,\"\nsaid a cheerful voice beside them. \"But the phosgene will keep on\ngoing down. Give them another!\"\n\nThe interval this time was longer. \"Now for a dirty crack,\" said the\ncheerful voice. \"Time this one.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA youngster nearby snapped a stop-watch as the bomb was released. He\nheld some printed tables in his hands. Odd receivers from which no\nwire led were clamped over his ears. This time the dull thud was long\nin coming. It was hardly perceptible when the young man with the stop\nwatch announced: \"Fifty thousand feet, sir.\"\n\n\"Give 'em another. Time it again.\" A second high explosive bomb was\nreleased.\n\n\"Fifty thousand feet, sir.\"\n\n\"Good. That measures it. And those last bombs have knocked the devil\nout of whatever machinery they've got down there. Now we'll give them\na real taste of gas. Two of the green ones there, men. Put ten miles\nof cable on the drums. Get that hoisting frame into place.\"\n\nBut night had come, though searchlights outside the crater and\nfloodlights within had robbed the night of its terror, when Smithy,\nwith Culver beside him, climbed over the guard rail of the lift that\nhung waiting just over the pit.\n\nA gas mask covered his entire face. Through its round eye plates he\nlooked at the others who crowded about him. Grotesque, almost\nludicrous--twenty men, armed with clumsy sub-machine guns; the others\nwould follow later. A searchlight was on a tripod at the center, and a\nspool of electric cable.\n\nThe light sizzled into life and swung slowly about. Then the platform\njarred, and the spool of cable began slowly to unwind. Beside him\nColonel Culver was returning the salute of an officer outside on the\nashy ground. Smithy raised his hand, but the brink of that pit had\nmoved swiftly up--there was nothing before him but a glassy wall.\n\nReconnaissance? Suicide? One word was as good as another. But he was\ngoing down--down where Dean Rawson had gone--down where there was a\ndebt to be paid.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n_The Red-Flowering Vine_\n\n\n\"Rotan,\" said Gor slowly, sadly, \"was wrong. His vision was not the\ntruth. The Red Ones have come. And now--we die.\"\n\n\"Without a fight?\" Rawson demanded incredulously.\n\n\"We are not a fighting people. We have no weapons. We can only die.\"\n\nRawson turned to Loah. They were inside the mountain, and the servants\nof the mountain, with terror and dismay written plainly on their\nfaces, were gathered about. \"At the Lake of Fire,\" said Rawson, \"when\nyou saved me, there was an explosion and clouds of white fumes. What\nwas it?\"\n\n\"It was like water,\" Loah said. \"We found it deep inside the earth in\na place where it is very cold. When warmed it turns to white clouds.\nWe threw a flask of it on the hot rocks, hoping to reach you while\nthey could not see.\"--she paused and shook her head slowly--\"but we\ncan get no more. The Pathway of Light is closed to us, now that the\nRed Ones are there.\"\n\n\"Liquefied gas of some sort,\" said Rawson briefly, \"caught in enormous\nrock pressure. But that's out! Now what about this Place of Death?\nThere's an idea there.\"\n\nThe White Ones were numbed with fear, but Loah and Gor accompanied him\nwhen Rawson returned to the red field. The flowers were still in\nbloom; they waved gently in the breeze that blew always from the\nmountain across the fields and out toward the point, where even now\ndark figures could be seen near the mouth of the shaft.\n\n\"It will be many of your days,\" said Loah, \"before the flowers die. If\nyou thought to trap the Red Ones in the Place of Death, there will not\nbe time....\" But Rawson had left them; he had advanced into the scarlet\nfield and dropped to his knees.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was crushing the vines in his hands, grinding them into the white,\nsalty earth underneath. Then he passed his hands guardedly before his\nface as if to detect an odor.\n\nLoah and Gor saw him shake his head slowly while he spoke aloud words\nthat they could not understand. \"Cyanide,\" Dean Rawson was saying.\n\"It's a cyanide of some sort--releases hydrocyanic acid gas. I could\nhave rigged a generator, though I've forgotten about all of my\nchemistry--and now there isn't time.\" Off in the distance the dark\nfigures still moved near the end of the point.\n\nHe made no effort to conceal his dejection as he returned. The edge of\nthe Place of Death made a winding line across the scant half mile of\nvalley where the green fields ended abruptly.\n\nDean stepped high over the stone trough a half mile long that marked\nthat dividing line. There was water in it; it was part of their\nirrigation system. A little beyond, in the midst of the green, stood a\ntiny flat-topped knoll on which he knew was a pool that supplied the\ncrude system. Beyond it Loah and Gor were waiting.\n\nGor read the look on Rawson's face. \"It is useless,\" Gor said. \"And\nnow I have decided. The People of the Light must die--but not in the\nfires of the Reds. With my people I shall walk into the sea.\"\n\nAnd Rawson could not protest. He could only follow as Gor turned back\ntoward the village and the mountain beyond.\n\nFrom a spur on the mountainside Rawson could see the full length of\nthe island. One way lay the village; beyond it the green fields; then\nthe wide scarlet band of the Place of Death. And beyond that the\nlittle crystal hills and the valley between that led out to the point.\nIt was now dark with massed clusters of bodies, red even at that\ndistance. He could even see the glint of metal from time to time.\n\nAnd behind the mountain were the People of Light, where Gor was only\nwaiting for the attack to lead them out to the island's farther end\nand then on to a kindlier death in the emerald sea. Only Loah was with\nDean, although there were others of the White Ones not far away,\nwatching, ready to warn Gor when the attack began.\n\nNot an hour before, Rawson had stood in the inner chamber and had\nlistened to the mountain as it repeated the words of a far-distant\nman: \"Attack of the mole-men growing increasingly ferocious ...\nheat-ray projectors--almost invincible ... our forces have entered the\nTonah Basin--they are descending into the crater. But whether warfare\ncan be carried on advantageously under ground is problematical....\"\nRawson unconsciously gritted his teeth behind his set lips as he\nwatched the Reds.\n\nHe knew why they had been so slow in attacking. They must have a\ncarrier of some sort, a shell like that of Loah's, and they were\nbringing their fighters one shell-load at a time. When the entire\nforce was ready they would attack. And Rawson was convinced that this\nforce would be limited in number.\n\n\"They'll have plenty to keep them busy up there,\" he argued. \"If only\nwe could wipe out this one lot we could prepare to defend ourselves.\"\nAnd now, standing on the side of the mountain, he startled Loah with\nthe fury of his sudden ejaculation.\n\n\"Fool! Quitter! Waiting here for them to come and get you! There's one\nchance in a million--\" Then he was rushing at full speed along the\nroadway that circled the mountain toward Gor and the terrified throng.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe waiting savages must have laughed, if indeed laughter was possible\nfor such a race, at sight of the White Ones creeping timidly down. Off\na mile and more they could see them harvesting their strange\ncrop--harvesting!--storing up supplies of food, no doubt, when the\nmole-men with their flame-throwers would reap the harvest so soon!\n\nBut in a crimson field Dean and Gor and Loah led the others where they\nswarmed across the Place of Death, gathering huge armfuls of the\nred-flowering vine, carrying them to the village and returning for\nmore. Where they trod it was as if peach pits were crushed beneath\ntheir feet. And there was a curious fragrance which Rawson told them\nnot to breathe, but to keep their faces always into the wind.\n\nTheir hands and bodies were sore and burned by the strong juice of the\nvines. They stopped often to cast apprehensive glances at the distant\ngroup of red figures, and always Rawson drove them in a frenzy of\nhaste. At last he made them move the long trough of stone beyond the\nedge of the green field and over into the Place of Death.\n\nRawson kept no track of the time. The voice of the mountain was his\nonly measure of hours in a world of perpetual day. But more\nhours--another day, perhaps--had passed when the Red force at last\nbegan to move.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey did not spread out wide across the valley, but formed a\nstraggling line that was denser toward the center. They could not know\nwhat opposition they would meet; for the present they would stay\ntogether. Above them as they came were twinkling lights of pale-green\nfire.\n\nThe radio had spoken of heat rays; Rawson wondered if that meant some\nnewer and more horrible instrument. But he saw nothing but the\nflame-throwers in the armament of this force.\n\nHe was waiting by the irrigation pool, hidden for the moment behind\nthe little knoll. Loah was with him; he had tried in vain to induce\nher to stay with Gor and the others who were waiting beyond the\nmountain.\n\nThere were watchers, some of them within hearing, whose voices relayed\nthe news of the enemy's advance. Then they ran; panic was upon them.\n\n\"_Tur--gona!_\" they cried, \"_Nu--tur--gona!_ We die! Quickly we die!\"\nRawson heard the shout carried on toward the hidden throng.\n\nCautiously he peered from the little knoll. They were coming. Already\nthey were trampling the remaining red blooms on the farther edge of\nthe field. But he waited till they were halfway across before he\nleaped to the top of the knoll, grasped a pole he had placed there in\nreadiness and rammed it down through the pool, turbid yellow with the\njuice from the vines, and broke open the outlet he had plugged in the\nbase.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne green light slashed above his head. One flicked at the knoll near\nhis feet, where green growing things burst into flame--then he threw\nhimself backward down the short rocky slope while the stones tore at\nhis nearly nude body. He sprang to his feet and held Loah close. On\neither side of the knoll was a holocaust of flame where green lights\nplayed. He waited breathlessly. The fires brought in a little back\ndraft of air, the scent of peach pits was strong--and then the green\nlights ceased. The unripe grain of the fields smoldered slowly.\n\nThen Rawson stepped from his hiding and stared out at the Place of\nDeath.\n\nNearby was a huddle of bodies. On either side, in a long, straggling\nline, they lay now on the ground--a windrow where Death had reaped.\nThe flames of their weapons still in action were all that moved. The\nwhite earth turned molten wherever those flames struck.\n\nFarther off there were red things that were running. The yellow liquid\nfrom the pool, charged with the acid of the vines, had been slow in\nflowing out through that long trough. The savages could only see that\ntheir fellows had fallen. Some mystery, something invisible and beyond\ntheir comprehension had struck them. They ran toward the center at\nfirst, then turned and fled--and by then the soft air blowing gently\nabout them had brought that strange fragrance of death. Then they,\ntoo, lay still.\n\nFrom the distance came faintly a booming chant, two thousand voices\nraised in unison. \"_Tur--gona! Nu--tur--gona!_\" The last of a once\nmighty people were marching to their death.\n\nRawson and Loah turned with one accord. Victory was theirs, but there\nwas no time to taste the fruits of victory. They ran with straining\nmuscles and gasping breath toward the distant mountain and the\nmarching host beyond.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"My plans are made,\" Rawson spoke quietly. \"I must go. I shall take\nthe shell--the jana--and go back to the mole-men's world. I shall go\nalone, and I shall die, but what of that?\" His eyes lit up for a\nmoment. \"I'll try to find _Phee-e-al_ first. If I can get him before\nthey get me, that will help.\"\n\nThey were standing on the mountain's lower slope, Gor and Leah and the\nservants of the mountain gathered near. Below, the White Ones were\nmassed in worshiping silence. Had not Dean-Rah-Sun saved them? And now\nwhat else would come to pass?\n\nThe same question had been asked by the Wise Ones, and now Rawson\nturned and spoke to them. \"Rotan was right,\" he told them. \"His vision\nwas true. There is work I must do here before I go. Your lands, or\nsome of them at least, will be restored. And you will be safe forever\nfrom what we have seen to-day. Gor will lead you wisely, and Loah....\"\nHis voice faltered; he had kept his eyes resolutely away from the slim\nfigure of the girl, who had been wordless, scarcely breathing. Now she\nstepped swiftly before him.\n\n\"You must go, Dean-San,\" she said gently. He knew it was a term of\nendearment. \"You must go if you say you must. But you do not go alone,\nnor die alone. Long ago the voice of the mountain spoke beautiful\nwords. I know now it was one of your priests telling of a woman of\nyour own race. Always have I remembered. 'Wheresoever thou goest, I\nshall go; thy people....'\"\n\nBut Dean Rawson had gathered the slender figure, starry-eyed and\nsobbing into his arms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n_Oro and Grah_\n\n[Sidenote: As part of their titanic plan, Rawson and Loah-San return\nto sacrifice themselves in the flaming caverns of the Red Ones.]\n\n[Illustration: _Then there were footsteps approaching the chest._]\n\n\n\"The Place of Death!\" said Dean Rawson. \"Whoever named it had the\nright idea.\"\n\nHe looked out across the wide stretch of ground with its covering of\nwhite salt almost entirely stripped of the carpet of vines. The bodies\nof the mole-men lay where they had fallen; their flame-throwers still\ntore futilely at the earth or stabbed upward in vain, thrusting toward\nthe green-gold sun that shone pitilessly down.\n\n\"Still I do not understand,\" said Gor. \"My people pressed the strong,\nburning water from the vines and poured it into the pool as you\ndirected. But the Red Ones did not touch it--how could it burn them?\"\n\n\"I'll say it was strong!\" said Rawson. He looked at his hands, red and\nburned where the liquid had touched. \"And it got stronger by standing.\nIt was an acid, and when it touched the white earth a gas was\nformed--hydrocyanic acid gas. And that's nothing to fool with.\"\n\nHe walked cautiously out where the liquid had been poured over the\nwhite ground. No odor remained; the air was clean. Then he picked up\none of the flame-throwers and experimented with it until he found the\nsliding sleeve that shut off the blast.\n\n\"All right,\" he called to Gor. \"Bring on your men; we've got to clean\nup this place and get rid of the bodies before the sun gets in its\nwork. They're the ones that will go into the ocean instead of you.\" He\nmoved carefully along the straggling line of bodies, salvaging the\nweapons and turning off their fearful blasts.\n\nThey worked and slept and worked again before their gruesome task was\ndone and Rawson was ready to begin the other work that he had in mind.\n\nBeside the mouth of the great shaft, resting on the rocks, was a\ncylinder, almost exactly a counterpart of the one Loah had used. But\nthis was larger--fully fifty of the red savages could have crowded\ninside.\n\n\"It is the only one they had,\" said Loah. \"I have seen, and I know.\"\n\n\"But they can make more,\" Gor argued. \"This one and the one we have,\"\nhe told Rawson, \"were made thousands of years ago. There were masters\nof metal-work among them, and they had learned to use Oro and Grah.\nEven then the people were divided. He who was then Gor and his\nfollowers fought with the others. But he left them one _jana_--this\nvery one here. Then Gor followed the Pathway to the Light, though he\nsealed it as you know. But--but they will build others. Sooner or\nlater they will come.\"\n\n\"I think not,\" said Rawson. \"Now what about this Oro and Grah\nmaterial? What was it you called them--the Sun-stone and the\nStone-that-loves-the-dark? I must know how they work.\" But Loah was\nreluctant to experiment with the _jana_ of the Reds; she had her own\nshell brought instead--and then Rawson learned the secret of what\nseemed its miraculous flight.\n\nA cylindrical metal bubble, just buoyant enough to lift itself above\nthe ground--Gor and some of the others brought it from the village.\nGor brought, too, a little box which he carried with great difficulty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It is Grah,\" he said, when he showed Rawson a little scattering of\nblack dust within the box. \"Always it tries to fall back under the\nground. Both Oro and Grah grow deep down near the Zone of the Fires;\nwe find them in the caves, Oro on one side and Grah on the other. Oro\nis as heavy in its upward falling as Grah is in its downward.\n\n\"Then\"--he pointed to the central vertical tube in the shell--\"we put\nboth of them in here, bringing it a few grains at a time. One falls to\none end and the other to the other. And then, with these simple\nvalves, we let out a little of whichever we wish--release it a grain\nat a time, if that is best. We let out a few grains of Grah, and Oro,\nbeing stronger, draws us upward; or we let a little of the Oro escape,\nand we fall downward swiftly. You see it is simple, as I said.\"\n\nRawson's reply was not an answer to Gor so much as it was an argument\nwith himself. \"Heavy,\" he said. \"Specific gravity beyond anything\nwe've ever known. Osmium, the heaviest substance we have, would be\nlight as a feather compared to this. But wait. This Grah, as you call\nit, falls downward, but that means it falls toward the outside of the\nearth. With us it would be light--light! And Oro would be heavy. New\nsubstance--new matter! One feels only the attraction of our normal\ngravitation; the other doesn't react to that at all, but is driven\noutward with tremendous force by counter-gravitation, the repulsion of\nthis Central Sun. You've used it cleverly, but we'd have done more\nwith it up on top.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was lost in thought for some minutes, muttering figures and\ncalculations half aloud. \"Two thousand miles from the Central Sun to\nus; two thousand more through the solid earth. And if that repelling\nforce follows Newtonian laws it will decrease as the square.... But,\ncoming down from up on top, normal gravity would decrease directly as\nthe distance!\" He made scratches with one small stone upon a larger\none in lieu of paper and pencil, but, to his listeners, his muttered\nwords could have meant nothing.\n\n\"Around six seventy-six hundred and seventy miles to the neutral zone,\nthe Zone of Fire. And a column of water--it would carry on by, plug\nthe shaft, check the back-pressure, and then....\" For the first time\nsince that night when the mole-men had poured out into the crater, his\neyes were alight with hope, though his face seemed tense and grim.\nThen the lines about his lips relaxed; he smiled at Loah.\n\n\"I would like to investigate this under-world,\" he said, \"--not very\nfar down. Will you take me?\"\n\nThe girl's adventurous spirit had led her on many exploring trips in\nthat subterranean world. She laughed happily when Rawson told her what\nhe wanted. \"But, yes,\" she said; \"of course I know such a place.\" And\nfrom some two or three miles below, after anchoring the _jana_\nsecurely, she led him through a winding tunnel where he knew he was\nsteadily climbing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a wide corridor that they followed, where the walls came\ntogether high above their heads; he could hardly see where they met by\nthe light of Loah's torch. Now and then there were lateral passages,\nbut they were narrow, hardly more than cracks; and Rawson, looking\ninto them, nodded his head with satisfaction.\n\nOccasionally his footsteps rang hollowly on the stone, and he knew\nthat the floor was thin between this and other caverns below. \"What an\nold honeycomb it is!\" he exclaimed. \"And we had it all figured as\nbeing solid. The weight is all here, of course, but it's concentrated\nin that red stuff down near the neutral zone. But anyway, Loah has\nshown me just what I wanted.\"\n\nHe had gathered a handful of little fragments, and, keeping count of\nhis steps, had shifted a bit of rock to his left hand for every\nhundred paces. By this he knew they must have gone five or six miles\nwhen he reached the tunnel's high point. Many times it had widened.\nHere, too, was a cave more than a hundred feet across.\n\nFrom the farther side the tunnel continued, pitching sharply downward,\nbut Rawson did not explore farther. \"I can seal that off with a\nflame-thrower,\" he said. \"I've seen how they use them.\" Then he took\nLoah's light and looked with every evidence of approval at the rocky\nwalls and the roof that seemed heavy with dew.\n\nHe had wondered about the air, but he found that it seeped through\nfrom that central shaft, although Loah told him that in some deeper\npassages the air was bad. Here, although it was moving gently, it\nseemed wet as if charged with moisture. Rawson, staring upward, felt a\ndrop strike him in the face, dripping from the rocks above.\n\n\"It's a gamble,\" he said, \"just a gamble. But the stakes are worth\nwhile. And now, Loah-San, we will return.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe made crude work with the flame-throwers at first but finally he got\nthe knack, and the mouth of the tunnel beyond the big room was sealed.\nThen, with the help of Loah and some few of the others, he brought in\nmore and more weapons of the Reds. He was curious as to their\nconstruction, but his curiosity had to go unsatisfied. They were only\ncylinders, so far as he could see, cylinders a foot long and six\ninches through, of some metal with the dull lustre of aluminum. But\nthey were sealed, and he dared not cut one open with another\nflame-thrower for fear of what might come forth.\n\nOn the top of each cylinder a tube was connected that ended in a lava\ntip; but at the base of the tube, where it joined the cylinder, was a\nsliding sleeve that checked the flame to nothing when it was moved, or\nopened it to the full blast.\n\nHe had a hundred of them in the room when at last he was through--one\nhundred fearful instruments of destruction. And still he told no one\nof his plans; he only told Gor what he wanted done later on. \"It may\nnot work,\" he had to admit to himself. \"I'm just guessing at the\nthickness of the rock and the power of these machines. It's a gamble,\nnothing but a gamble.\"\n\nHe arranged the flame-throwers in a circle along the outer wall. The\ntops of the cylinders were curved, but the bottoms were flat and they\nset solidly on the rock. But he tipped them backward and braced them\nfirmly with fragments of stone until every crooked-neck tube was\npointed upward and toward the center. Finally he was done.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was only a matter of a few hours later when Rawson stood on the\nisland's end by the mouth of the shaft. In his ears was the ceaseless\nrush of the air as it entered the pit; it was the only sound in a\nsilent world. And for the first time there came overwhelmingly upon\nhim a realization of what this moment meant.\n\nThe time had come. Loah was beside him, her lovely eyes unnaturally\nbright in her face from which all the blood seemed to have flowed. He\nfelt the slight trembling of her body as she pressed against him; he\nknew she was struggling to keep back the tears. Then Rawson half\nturned with one final entreaty that she let him go alone; but he left\nthe words unsaid--he had argued it several times before.\n\nBefore them stood Gor, then the Wise Ones, the Servants of the\nMountain, deserting their post for the first time since the Mountain\nhad been given a voice. Beyond them all the people of this little\nworld were gathered.\n\nIt had seemed only a fanciful dream, this thought of going; in fact,\nhe had been too busy, too pressed with his own preparations, to give\nit thought. Now he was learning to his own surprise how closely he had\nidentified himself with this world and its people. It had given him\nLoah; it had been a haven, a sanctuary.\n\nHe let his eyes slowly take in the full splendor of that emerald sea,\nthe shining land under a green-gold sun, the Mountain in white,\ncrystal purity against a green-blue sky. And he was leaving it, he and\nLoah; they were going to--death!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You will remember,\" he said to Gor. His voice sounded dull and heavy;\nit hardly seemed himself who was speaking. \"You know the day and the\nhour. This is the nineteenth. It is now noon--twelve o'clock in my\nworld. When the Voice of the Mountain says that noon again has come\nyou will do as I said.\"\n\n\"The Mountain speaks without ceasing now,\" said Gor, \"telling always\nof what the Red Ones do. We will count the hours as they pass. In\ntwenty-four of those hours Gor will descend in the _jana_ of the Reds\nto do as Dean Rah-Sun has commanded.\"\n\nRawson held out his hand. He was suddenly wordless. Then Loah threw\nherself into Gor's arms in one last passionate embrace--but it was she\nwho entered the _jana_ first.\n\n\"Come,\" she said to Dean. \"Oh, come quickly, Dean-San!\" Then he, too\nstepped inside and made the heavy door fast.\n\nMen of the White Ones had been holding the big cylinder down. But\nRawson, staring through the window, saw that it was Gor's own hands\nthat swung them out at last above the pit.\n\nTheir craft hung quivering for an instant in the rushing air; then\nLoah moved one of the levers a trifle and the blackness took them, and\nonly the little bull's-eyes in the metal ceiling showed the fading\nglow of the Inner World, the home of the People of the Light, which\ntheir eyes never again would see.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n_The Bargain_\n\n\nRawson had taken one flame-thrower with him. He tied it securely\ninside the shell so it could not shift with the changing gravity, or\nbe accidentally turned on. Again he clung to the curved bar against\nthe wall. Loah stood at the center, directing the craft.\n\nOnce again he floated in air, then found himself standing on what had\nbeen the ceiling of the room. The girl had released a considerable\nquantity of the lifting element in the _jana's_ end, and now the black\npowder in the other end of the central tube was dragging them at\nterrific speed as it rushed away from the earth's center.\n\nOver six hundred miles, Rawson had figured, from that inner surface to\nthe neutral zone where the red substance of the earth, that was\nneither rock nor metal, under terrific pressures, glowed with fervent\nheat or formed pools like the Lake of Fire.\n\nPerhaps a hundred miles thick, that zone of incessant energy, and\ntheir little craft tore through it at tremendous speed. Even so, he\nwas gasping for breath in the heated room when the glow faded and\nagain he swung over and down upon the floor as Loah checked the speed\nof the flying projectile and the little ship crept slowly up into the\nroom where first he had seen it.\n\nThe first that he noticed was the absence of the roar. The _jana_\ndrifted slowly to one side, and Loah let it come to rest upon the\nfloor. Staring from the open door, Rawson saw the same familiar red\nwalls and floor and the black opening of the shaft from which they had\ncome. But the reverberating roar of the great organ-pipe was gone. He\nknew that the air, for the greater part, was driving on past through\nthe upper shaft that was now open. The way was clear for them to\nascend. He turned to the girl.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"If my figures are right, it's some thirteen hundred miles from here\non. How did you get up there before?\"\n\nLoah pointed to the passage where the _jana_, on that other excursion,\nhad been hidden. \"We went through there,\" she said, \"taking the _jana_\nwith us. We went up many miles through a great crack, but it was not\nstraight; we had to go carefully till another passage opened through\nto the shaft far above where it was sealed.\"\n\n\"And the mole-men never found it?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Loah, \"they must have known of the crack, but they did\nnot know where it led. Its air was bad--a gas that choked; one could\nnot breathe it and live. But in our little _jana_ we were safe. They\ncould not use theirs; it was too large. Besides, only the priests came\ndown. They had their Lake of Fire, where they did horrible things.\nThey did not know that the shaft began again below.\"\n\n\"O. K.,\" said Rawson, and closed the door.\n\n\"But I wish to get out,\" Loah protested, \"to gather more of the Oro.\nWe may need more, should we return.\"\n\n\"We will never need it,\" Rawson spoke softly. \"From the time we left\nGor we had just twenty-four hours to live. We must go on, and go\nfast.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey had no way of measuring time, and Rawson could only guess at the\nhours that passed while their little ship tore swiftly upward through\nthe dark. He wondered if the occasional shrill shriek that followed\nthe touching of their metal guides on the glassy walls could be heard\nup above.\n\nThen, at last, Loah was driving the _jana_ slowly while she held her\nlight so it would shine through a window. Rawson had to restrain\nhimself to keep from pacing the little room like a caged animal while\nthe precious minutes slipped by. Now that the enemy was near he wanted\nnothing but to drive on up to the end of the shaft, come out into that\nworld wherever the shaft ended, then try to fight his way through to\nthe great hall where he hoped to find Phee-e-al. And his haste made\nhim overestimate the passing time; their journey had been swifter than\nhe knew.\n\n\"I may have passed it,\" Loah was saying doubtfully. \"I may have come\ntoo far.\" Then she interrupted herself and sprang to the controls.\n\nThey drifted slowly back. \"It is different now,\" Loah said; \"the air\nrises more swiftly than before.\" She stared from the windows while she\ndrove the _jana_ slowly up and down, trying to bring it to equilibrium\nin the strong up-draft.\n\nThe air entered the shell through a little opening with the same\npungent tang Rawson had noticed before. He had wondered about the air.\nDown near the neutral zone it was dense, yet he had not minded the\npressure too greatly--and that had been puzzling.\n\n\"Rock pressure and air pressure,\" he had reasoned; \"they are two\ndifferent things. If the rock flowed, any air that it trapped would be\nsqueezed to a liquid. But it doesn't flow--that red stuff is solid; so\nthe air pressure is only the weight of the air column itself. But even\nthat should be enormous.\"\n\nHe could only conclude that the lessened pressure came from that\nstrange counter-gravitation, the repelling force from the center of\nthe earth. Perhaps it tended to dissipate the molecules, held them\nfarther apart, prevented their squeezing in together, and battering\nwith a thousand little impacts on a point where one had hit before.\n\nTheir _jana_ swayed gently as if the smooth air currents were\ndisturbed and were drifting them sideways; and then, at last, Loah,\npeering from a window, sprang back and moved a lever. Beneath them was\nthe softly-cushioned thud of the shell seating itself on firm rock.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were in another of the interminable caves, Rawson found when he\nopened the door. The _jana_ was resting a few feet in from the edge of\nthe shaft. Cautiously they got out, but even without their weight it\nhad a slight negative buoyancy.\n\n\"Oro is pulling more strongly than Grah,\" Dean said, and smiled.\nAlready the names seemed familiar to him.\n\nThe two lifted the _jana_ and carried it back some twenty feet more\nbefore Rawson realized how unnecessary this was.\n\n\"We'll never be using it again,\" he said. \"If I've guessed right it\nwill stay here as long as the rocks; if not--but we'll never know the\ndifference anyway.\"\n\nHe took the flame-thrower from the car in sudden haste. \"Quick,\ndear,\" he told Loah. \"God knows when the end will come. Quick, show me\nthe way.\"\n\nLoah knew every step of the route that took them on and upward through\na maze of twisting passages, and Rawson marveled at her sense of\ndirection. She flashed her light at times--the little bar of metal\nthat had in one hollow end a substance which absorbed the light-energy\nof the Central Sun. Rawson knew how it worked. Even the lights in the\nmountain room were taken out from time to time and exposed to the\nsunlight that brought them back into glowing life. He had seen similar\nphenomena on earth. But, for the most part, Loah kept the little metal\ncap in place on the end of her torch, and they moved cautiously\nthrough the dark.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSounds of the Red Ones came to them at times. And once they hid in a\nnarrow branching cleft that came abruptly to a dead end, while a force\nof red warriors marched hurriedly through the passage they had just\nleft. Back in their hiding place Rawson stood tense and ready, with\nhis weapon till the last of the enemy was gone.\n\nAlways he was frantic at thought of the time that was slipping\npast--until, at last, the narrow passage that they followed cut\ntransversely through another large runway that glowed faintly from\nsome distant light.\n\nWith that first gleam of light there came over Dean Rawson an odd\nchange. Something within him had been cold with fear. Fear of the\nflying minutes. Fear that Loah might have lost her way in this tangled\nlabyrinth of winding ways. And now, suddenly, he was care-free, filled\nwith an absurd joy. Nothing mattered. They were to die, but what of\nthat? Loah had chosen death; he would see that when it came to her,\nit would be quickly and without pain. And as for himself, if before he\ndied he could remove this ruler of an enemy race....\n\nSo when Loah leaned close and whispered, \"The light--it shines from\nthe council room of Phee-e-al,\" Dean replied almost gaily; \"I've got\nto hand it to you--you sure do know all the back alleys.\" Then he\nstuck his head cautiously out into the dimly-lighted corridor.\n\nIt was broad. He saw where their own little passageway went on from\nthe opposite side. But the light--the light! At his left, not a\nhundred steps away, was a room, brilliantly lighted. And across it, in\ngleaming splendor, stretched a low wall--a barrier of gold. It was the\ncouncil room, where once before he had faced Phee-e-al in all that\nsavage's hideous splendor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe listened. All was silent. Then Loah whispered: \"Phee-e-al comes\nthis way when he goes to the council room. But when he comes, or how\noften, I do not know.\"\n\nDean pressed her back into the narrow way with his hands. \"Wait here!\"\nhe said, and gave her the flame-thrower. \"I've an idea!\" He stepped\nsoftly out into the broad passage and on naked, noiseless feet, moved\nswiftly toward the lighted room.\n\nIt was empty. Beyond the barrier were no red figures, nor were there\nwhistling voices to echo as he had heard them before. Here was the\nthrone where Phee-e-al had sat; here the priests had stood; there,\nalong the wall, were the chests.\n\nFully twenty of them, each eight feet long, they stood ranged along\nthe three walls of that part of the room protected by the barrier. No\ntwo of them alike; all of them were oddly carved and studded with\njewels.\n\nThe chests were ranged in a straight row a foot or more out from the\nwall. He crossed to them swiftly. About here was where that priest\nmust have gone. He raised one of the heavy lids till the light struck\nwithin.\n\nBones! Only fragments of a skeleton, blackened by age; a necklace of\nteeth from some animal's jaw; worthless trifles for the mummery of the\npriests. Then, beneath them, he saw two great fangs, a foot in length.\nThey were curved, sharply pointed and yellow as old ivory.\n\nWhat was it Gor had said of legends that told of ancestors coming from\nthe outer world? Rawson knew that he was looking at priceless relics\nof the tribe, at the tusks of man's long extinct enemy, the great\nsabre-toothed tiger.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut he had neither time nor thoughts to spare for marvels new or\nold--he must find his gun. Yet, even then, he wondered what\nundreamed-of treasures the other chests might hold--what jewels, what\nparaphernalia of ancient kings.\n\nHe must be silent! Perhaps the next great glittering container might\nhold the blue gleam of his gun. And this time as the gem-studded lid\nwas swung upward and back to rest noiselessly against the rock wall,\nDean could not repress the audible gasp that came to his lips.\n\nHis own pistol! He had expected to find the one weapon, but, instead,\nthe chest was filled with all it would hold of rifles and side arms\nand cartridge belts, all mingled in one indiscriminate heap.\n\nThey were twisted, some of them, and bent; discolored, too, evidently\nby flames. On some the stocks had been burned off.\n\nRawson's hands were suddenly trembling. There was one rifle that\nseemed unharmed; he brought it out, and hardly heard the little\nclatter that it made among the other weapons. An ammunition belt--he\nslipped out a clip of cartridges, made sure they fitted his gun, and\nthrew one up into the firing chamber. He was fumbling for more of the\nclips when there pierced through his tumultuous thoughts the\nrealization that he was hearing sounds not made by his own suddenly\nclumsy hands.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMarching feet, whistling voices--they came from beyond the room's\nfarther end, beyond the entrance through which he had once been\nbrought a captive. He took one step back toward the broad tunnel, then\nknew there were others coming there.\n\nThere was no possible avenue of escape. He threw himself in one wild\ndive into the narrow space between the chests and the wall, and pulled\nhimself forward under the shelter of the one back-turned lid. The\nrifle was still gripped in his hands.\n\nBy the sounds that came to him, he knew that the outer room had filled\nwith red warriors, and that another smaller group had come scuffing\nfrom the passage where he had just entered. And, by the echoing cry of\nshrill voices that shouted, \"Phee-e-al! Phee-e-al!\" he knew that the\nruler was near.\n\nThen there were footsteps approaching the chest. A priest no doubt;\nshrill whistling told of his anger. The concealing cover was jerked\noutward and down, and Rawson, staring above him, saw not the coppery\nface that he had expected, but the hideous white visage of Phee-e-al\nhimself.\n\nFor an instant the ruler of the mole-men stood half stooped in\npetrified astonishment, and in that moment Rawson dragged himself to\nhis feet. No chance to use the gun--the other was upon him, his\ngripping talons tearing Rawson's bare flesh. In one flashing thought,\nDean cursed himself for the uselessness of his weapon--he should have\ntaken a pistol, an automatic. Then, body to body with the savage, he\nwas dragged out over the chest.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had been holding the rifle above him, as he struggled from his\ncramped quarters. The savage had grabbed him about the shoulders, but\nhis hands were still free; they held the gun on high. And in the\nsecond when he found his feet under him, as Phee-e-al dragged him\nclear of the chest, Rawson brought the breech of the gun crashing down\nupon the pointed skull.\n\nHe felt the talons release their hold. The priests were rushing upon\nhim. Phee-e-al, too, had been only momentarily stunned--he was\nspringing. Then Rawson whipped the rifle down in line, and the\nclamoring shrieks that filled the room with tumult were drowned under\nanother roar.\n\nHe saw Phee-e-al fall. Even then, through all the pandemonium within\nhis own mind, he thrilled with satisfaction at sight of a little dot\nand a spreading stain above Phee-e-al's heart, where only bare skin\nhad been before.\n\nThe next shot took the foremost of the priests. The others paused,\nhesitant for a moment, ranged out in an irregular line. Past them,\nbeyond the golden barrier, Rawson caught a confused glimpse of a sea\nof red faces. Green flames were stabbing upward from their ready\nweapons. The priests were between him and them, and there came to\nRawson in that instant, through all the chaos of fighting and\nhalf-formed plans, the knowledge that these priests were a living\nbarrier that held off the flames.\n\nHe fired once more to check them, then sprang for the wide entrance\nof the tunnel. He fired again back of him, shooting wildly as he ran,\nthen saw Loah as she came from her hiding place with the flame-thrower\nready in her hand.\n\n\"Quick!\" he gasped. \"Get back!\" Then, with her, he was running\nstumblingly through the dark.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere could be no escape; even while they fled he knew it. And yet\nthey almost made it--though the end, when it came, was one that\nneither could possibly have foreseen.\n\nThey were following a wide passage, one of the countless thoroughfares\nof the Reds. It was deserted. Loah flashed her light freely. Ahead of\nthem the passage turned. Just short of that bend was a rift in the\nrocks.\n\n\"There!\" Loah gasped. \"Turn there. It will take us back to the\n_jana_.\" But the words were followed by a flash of green from dead\nahead.\n\nThe flames that made it came quickly after and a dozen of the red\nwarriors were before them, the light of their weapons slanting just\nabove Rawson's head. His rifle was half raised--they would at least\nfight to the last. Then he realized that the green death was not\nswinging downward.\n\nFrom behind them, in the corridor through which they had raced, came a\nchorus of whistling shouts. Rawson whirled to find more of the red\nfighters, and again, though their hissing green flames were held\nready, they did not descend.\n\nA priest, copper-colored, shining resplendently in the weird glow,\ndetached himself from the group and stepped forward under the\nprotection of their weapons. Loah's hand was depressing the muzzle of\nRawson's rifle. \"Wait!\" she said. \"He wishes to speak.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe priest stopped and addressed them. Loah answered; and to Rawson it\nseemed horrible that her lips and throat should be called upon to form\nthose whistling words. Then she turned toward him.\n\n\"He says they will not harm you now if you surrender. Later, when they\nselect a new ruler, he may order you set free.\"\n\nRawson was doing some quick thinking. The priest was lying, clumsily,\nchildishly, but it might be he could bargain with them.\n\n\"Tell them this,\" he ordered Loah: \"they are to let you go free--let\nyou go right now! If they do that, I'll lay down my gun. If they\ndon't, that priest will die before they get me. I don't think you can\nmake it,\" he added, \"but go back to the _jana_. Don't stop for\nanything. Drive it as fast as you can; you may still get there before\nGor does his stuff. And take the flame-thrower in case you are\nfollowed--\" He stopped; Loah was laughing.\n\n\"Did you really think, Dean-San, that I would desert you?\" Again she\nlaughed softly--laughing squarely in the face of that waiting death, a\nlaugh that was half a sob, that caught suddenly in her throat as she\nstared at Dean.\n\nHe could not read the look in her eyes as their expression changed.\n\"Yes,\" she said slowly, \"yes, you are right. If I stay we both die,\nquickly.\"\n\nAgain her voice made whistling sounds; the priest replied. Then Loah\nthrew her arms around Dean and kissed him. He was gripping his rifle;\nbefore he could take her in his arms, she was gone. She walked\nswiftly, the flame-thrower in her hands, toward the dark cleft in the\nrocks, through which she disappeared. And Dean, though she had done\nwhat he really wished, felt that all of his life and strength had\ngone with him with that fleeing figure.\n\nHe placed his rifle on the floor and, straightening, held out his\nempty hands; the priest's talons were upon his flesh.\n\n\"But I got Phee-e-al, anyhow,\" he was thinking dully.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n_Smithy_\n\n\nScarcely more than a vault in the solid rock, the room where Rawson\nlay. He had seen it for an instant when the priest, after tying his\nhands behind him, had hurled him viciously into the room. It had but\none entrance, though up high on one wall was a crack some two feet in\nwidth that admitted fresh air. A little room, only some twenty feet\nsquare; but he would not suffocate--the priests did not intend that he\nshould die--not yet.\n\nHe saw one of the giant yellow workers bring a big metal plate. He put\nit before the doorway; then, by the red glow, he knew that they had\nsealed him in.\n\n\"I got Phee-e-al,\" he thought. \"I did that much to help. That may put\na crimp in their plans, check the invasion up above. But Gor didn't do\nas I told him, or it didn't work. The twenty-four hours must have gone\nby.\"\n\nThen, even in that thought, he found happiness. \"That means that Loah\nis safe,\" he told himself. \"The shaft is clear; she's on her way back\nright now.\"\n\nHe pictured the _jana_ falling swiftly through that dark shaft. He saw\nin his mind the beautiful figure of the girl, lithe and slender,\nstanding at the controls.\n\nAbout him was a silence like that of the grave; his blood pounded in\nhis temples like a throbbing drum. It was some time before he knew\nthat, with that throbbing, other faint sounds were mingled.\n\nThey came from the wall beside him, sharp tappings muffled by\ndistance, the faintest whispering echo of rock striking upon rock.\n_Tap-tap_ ... _tap_. A longer pause.... _Tap._ They were making dots\nand dashes that blurred with the beating in his own brain.\n\nIn that dreadful silence he strained every nerve in an agony of\nlistening. There was nothing more.\n\nHe had been roughly handled by the savages. His whole body was bruised\nand aching, his thoughts hazy and blurred. \"Woozy,\" he told himself.\n\"Guess the old bean must have got a bad crack. Hearing things--mustn't\ndo that.\"\n\nAgain he tried to picture the girl, speeding on toward that inner\nworld. Was she thinking of him? Surely she was. He could hear her\ncalling his name. \"Dean,\" she was saying. \"Dean-San.\" The words were\nrepeated, an agonized, ghostly whisper--repeated again, \"Dean-San--oh,\nDean-San,\" before he knew that the sound was coming from overhead.\nThen a light flashed once in the little room, and he saw her face,\nlooking down.\n\nShe was beside him an instant later. \"Dean-San,\" she was saying, \"did\nyou think that I really would leave you?\" She was pressing her lips to\nhis. Uncovering her light, she worked frenziedly at the metal cords\nthat bound his wrists, pausing only to repeat her caresses--and at\nlast he was free.\n\n\"I reached the _jana_,\" she told him in hurried whispers, \"and then I\ncame up. Their great room, where the Pathway to the Light begins, was\ndeserted. With a cord I pulled the lever, and the _jana_ vanished. I\ncould not leave it for them to use. Then I followed--I knew by the\nsounds where they were taking you. And now, what can we do, Dean-San?\nWhere can we go?\"\n\nIt was real! Loah was there beside him; he had her in his arms, his\nbruised, bleeding arms whose hurts he no longer felt. And then,\nthrough his mind, flashed the question: if this was real, what of the\nother--the rappings he had heard? Perhaps it hadn't been a dream.\n\nHe lifted a fragment of rock and crashed it against the wall from\nwhich those rappings apparently had come. Laboriously he spelled out\nhis name, remembering the dots and dashes from earlier flying days\nwhen planes had been equipped with key-senders. He spelled it slowly\nand waited, while only the silence beat upon him and the blood pounded\nin his ears. Then he heard it. The answer came from a quicker hand:\n\n\"Rawson--this is Smithy.\"\n\nBut Smithy was dead! What could it mean? Slowly Rawson pounded out the\nletters of his question: \"Where--are--you?\" The answer dispelled his\nlast doubt as to the reality of what he had heard.\n\nIt _was_ Smithy. Others were with him, for Smithy said \"we,\" and they\nwere prisoners, sealed up in a living tomb. But where? Smithy did not\nknow. He knew only that they were in a big room where the rocks had\nbeen shattered and molten gold spilled on the floor. There was a hole\nin the roof, but too small to get through--a round hole, about eight\ninches in diameter. And, at that, Rawson interrupted to tap out a\nsingle word.\n\n\"Coming!\" he said, and turned toward Loah and the light.\n\nThe girl had found a metal rope in her wanderings; she had used it to\nlet herself down into the cave. And now it was she who helped Dean to\npull his bruised body up and into the narrow crack. Loah had clung to\nthe flame-thrower; they found it where she had left it up above.\n\nThe tapping rocks she could not understand, but she knew Dean had a\ndefinite plan in mind when he whispered: \"The room where you first\nfound me--do you remember? Do you know the way?\"\n\n\"I will always remember,\" she said simply. \"And, yes, I know the way.\"\n\nRawson caught glimpses now and again of that broad thoroughfare along\nwhich he had once traveled, a prisoner of the mole-men. But Loah knew\nother and seldom-used passages that roughly paralleled it; and then,\nafter a time, Rawson himself knew in what direction they must go.\n\nHe knew, too, that they had followed a circular route, and that the\nroom in which he had been sealed was not a great way from the place in\nwhich Smithy was a prisoner. Yet this had been his only way to reach\nit.\n\nWhen they came to a sudden sharp turn, he realized that they were\nclose. Beyond that bend would be the branching, lateral tunnel that\nled to Smithy's prison.\n\nThe main runway had been deserted by the Reds. Stopping often to\nlisten, starting at times into side passages at some fancied alarm,\nthey had met with no opposition. But now, from beyond the angling\npassage, came the familiar shrillness of the mole-men's voices.\n\nAgain the two concealed themselves, but no one approached. \"It's a\nguard we hear,\" Rawson whispered. \"They're guarding that entrance\nwhere we must go. They're taking no chances on Smithy's escaping.\"\nThen he crept to the point where the passage turned, the flame-thrower\nready in his hand.\n\nHe drew back. For the moment it seemed to him physically impossible to\nturn this weapon upon them. They were savages, true, but it seemed\nhorrible to slash living bodies with a weapon like this. Then he\nthought of the devastation those same weapons had wrought among the\npeople of his own world. His momentary hesitation vanished. With one\nspring he leaped into the open where, a hundred feet away, red bodies\nwere massed, and the air above was quivering with the green jets of\ntheir weapons.\n\nHis own flame-thrower he had turned to a tiny point of light; now it\nroared forth in fury as he swung it forward. They had no time even to\naim their weapons or to turn them on. They were stampeded by the\nastounding attack. And still Rawson sickened as he saw them fall.\n\nThere were some who, panic-stricken, dropped their cylinders and\nleaped for safety in a narrow branching way. Rawson knew he should\nhave killed them, knew it in the instant that they vanished, but that\nmomentary, uncontrollable revulsion within him had stayed his hand.\n\nHe rushed forward now, Loah still bravely at his side--past the fallen\nbodies, through the choking odor of burned flesh. Grabbing up one of\nthe weapons that had been dropped, he thrust it into her hands and\nsaid: \"Wait here. Stand them off if they come back.\" Then he was\nrushing up the side corridor toward a room where once, in a\nfar-distant past, he himself had been confined.\n\nThe flame-thrower lighted the way. It showed him the metal plate and\nthe smooth, glassy rock that had been melted around its edge. He\npounded on the metal and shouted Smithy's name.\n\nVoices answered from within--voices almost unintelligible for the\nwonder and unbelief and joy that made them a confusion of wordless\nshouts. Then he stepped back and turned the blast of his weapon upon\nthe rock at the edge of the plate.\n\nThe metal sheet moved at last, its top swinging slowly outward. Its\nbase was held by the gummy, hardening rock. Then it broke free and\ncrashed to the floor, and the light of Dean's weapon showed through\nthe black opening upon the blanched faces of men, where eyes were\nstill wide in disbelief.\n\nThough they were looking at one of their own kind, it must have taken\nthen a moment to realize that the naked body, clad only in a golden\nloin cloth, and the hands that held one of the fearful, green-flamed\nweapons, were those of a human. Then one of them broke from the\nothers, sprang heedlessly across the still-glowing plate, and threw\nhis arms about the barbaric figure.\n\n\"Dean!\" he choked. \"Dean, it's really you! You're alive!\"\n\nAnd Rawson's voice, too, was husky as he said: \"Smithy, I thought you\nwere gone. The radio said they had got you, old man.\"\n\nThen other khaki-clad bodies, a dozen of them, were crowding through\nthe hot portal, and Rawson came suddenly to himself.\n\n\"Quick!\" he shouted. \"They'll be after us in a second. Follow me.\"\n\nLoah was waiting. Her own flame-thrower spat a little jet of green; it\nwas the only light. Rawson saw here she had gathered up the other\nweapons and had turned them off so that even their little light would\nnot blind her as she kept watch down the dark passage.\n\n\"Do we want them?\" Dean shouted to the others. And Smithy echoed the\nquestion:\n\n\"Do we want them, Colonel?\"\n\nColonel Culver, his face almost unrecognizable under its smears of\npowder stains and blood, snapped a quick answer: \"No. We outrange them\nwith our rifles. They're only flame-throwers, not ray projectors. Beat\nit! Run like the devil!\"\n\nRawson snatched Loah's weapon and threw it with the others. It would\nbe hard going, ahead--she must not be uselessly burdened. But he kept\nhis own. Then with his one free hand he swept her up till she was\nracing beside him as they led the way.\n\n\"I should have kept the fire weapon,\" the girl protested; \"I, too, can\nfight.\"\n\nRawson, speaking between breaths, reassured her: \"Too heavy. Their\nguns will protect us--\"\n\nBehind them, a man's voice cried out once, a single, hoarse scream of\nagony; then the rock wall took the sharp crackle of rifle fire and\nthrew the sound into crashing, thundering echoes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n_Power!_\n\n\nA girl whose creamy body was strangely unsoiled by smoke or grime,\nwhose jeweled breast-plates flashed in the light of her torch while\nthe loose wrappings about her waist whipped against her as she ran.\nAnd Rawson, naked but for the golden loin cloth, running beside her.\nThen Smithy, and ten others in the khaki uniform of the service--it\nwas all that was left of the fifty who had dared the depths. And now\nall of them were harried and driven like helpless animals in the\nburrows and runways of that under-world.\n\nBut not entirely helpless. Colonel Culver had been right: their rifles\noutranged the flame-throwers. And Rawson, looking past that first\nburst of rifle fire, saw the one flame that had reached them whip\nupward as its owner fell. Others of the Reds came crowding in after,\nand the jets of their weapons made little areas of light as they\ncrashed to the floor. Then Colonel Culver took charge of the retreat.\n\nAhead of them and behind them was impenetrable darkness; only the\nnearby walls were illumined by the torch that Loah had been forced to\nturn on. And out of that darkness at any moment might come devastating\nflames. Culver detailed two men as a rear guard and two others to run\nahead a few paces in advance. At intervals of a minute or two their\nrifles would crack, and the echoes would be pierced by the whining\nscream of ricochets, as their bullets glanced from the walls.\n\n\"We may not need them up ahead,\" Culver shouted to Rawson. \"I don't\nunderstand it. The place seems deserted--there were plenty of them\nhere before!\"\n\n\"They've got something else to think of,\" Rawson shouted in reply. \"I\nkilled Phee-e-al--he was their leader. But they're after us now.\nThey'll be running through other passages, cutting in ahead of us.\"\n\nThe tunnel turned and bent upward. For a full half mile they ran\nstraight in a stiff climb. Between gasping breaths Colonel Culver\nshouted hoarsely: \"Won't it ever turn? If they bring up their damned\nheat-ray machines they'll get us on a straightaway like this!\"\n\nThen Smithy's voice outshouted his with a note of hope: \"We're almost\nthere; I remember this place. There's where we mounted the\nsearchlight. They've ripped everything out. Up ahead, one turn to the\nright, then a quarter mile, then a turn toward the crater. That runs\nstraight for a mile, but there's a field gun at the bottom of the\nvolcano. We'll be safe when we're on that last stretch.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAhead of them the rifles of the two who ran in advance crashed out in\na fury of fire as a green glow appeared. But this time the flame did\nnot die; and Rawson, staring with hot, wide-opened eyes, saw that the\nribbon of green swept transversely across the tunnel.\n\nHe could hardly stand when he came to a stop. Beside him Loah was\nswaying with weariness. The walls echoed only the hoarse, panting\nbreath of the men. Then they crept slowly forward, where the passage\nwent steadily up. Loah's light was out; she had slipped the cap on the\ntorch at the first sight of that green.\n\nThey stopped but ten feet short of the deadly blaze. From a narrow\nrift in the left wall it streamed outward, the rock at the edges of\nthat crack turning to red at its touch. It beat upon the opposite\nwall, where already the stone was melting to throw over them a white\nglare and the glow of heat. And, like a shimmering, silken barrier,\nwhose touch could mean only instant death, it reached across the wide\ntunnel at the height of a man's waist and moved slowly up and down.\nThe heaviest armor plate ever rolled could have formed no more\nimpenetrable a barrier.\n\n\"And we almost made it,\" said Smithy slowly. \"Look, beyond\nthere--another hundred feet. There's the bend in the tunnel, a sharp\nturn--and we almost got around!\"\n\nRawson reached for Loah's light. In the wall where the flame was\nstriking, only a dozen steps back, he had seen another dark mouth, a\nragged crack in the rock. He sprang to the entrance; it might be there\nwas another way around. His first glance told the story, for he saw\nthe walls draw together again not a hundred feet off.\n\n\"A blind alley,\" he groaned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the two who had been their advance guard snapped his rifle to\nhis shoulder. He was aiming at the glowing crack where the green light\nwas issuing.\n\n\"A ricochet,\" he growled. \"It may go on in and mess 'em up.\" But there\nwas no whine of a glancing bullet that followed his shot; the\nsoftened wall had cushioned the impact.\n\nAnother man sprang beside him. He was shouting at the top of his voice\nwhile one hand reached into a bag that hung at his waist. \"Get back,\neveryone,\" he said. \"If I miss....\" He did not finish the sentence,\nbut pulled the pin from a hand grenade, then took careful aim and\nthrew.\n\nIt went high--thrown there purposely; he had not dared aim it into the\nflame. But it struck the crevice fairly, and they heard it rattle on\ninside. The next instant brought the crack and roar of its explosion.\n\nLike a winking signal light the green barrier vanished. Where it had\nbeen was only blackness and the dying glow of molten rock. Then, a\nhundred feet beyond, up close to the roof, the bend of the tunnel\nturned red; it seemed bursting into flame. Far back of them, down the\nlong sloping way where they had come, shrill voices were\nscreaming--and still there was no green flame to account for that\ntunnel end flaming red.\n\nRawson stood motionless. Loah, and the others beside him, seemed\nlikewise petrified, until the voice of Culver jarred them into action.\n\n\"The ray!\" he shouted. \"It's the heat ray, damn them! Quick, jump into\nthat cave!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey had all retreated through fear of the grenade; they were opposite\nthe black place into which Rawson had looked. Loah was close beside\nDean; he threw her with all his strength into the black mouth of the\ncave, then he was one of a crowding, stumbling mass of men who\nfollowed after, and their going was lighted by a terrible torch of\nflame.\n\nOne man had stood apart from the others, farther across the wide\ncorridor. His khaki-clad body flashed suddenly to incandescence, then\nfell to the floor. And inside the cave, where the walls came abruptly\ntogether to cut off any further retreat, Colonel Culver spoke softly.\n\n\"One more gone,\" he said. \"That was Oakley. Well, he never knew what\nit was that hit him--and it looks as if we'll all get the same.\"\n\nThrough it all, Rawson had clung to his flame-thrower; unconsciously\nhis hand had held fast to the bent handle of the cylindrical weapon.\nNow he set it down slowly upon the floor, then straightened his aching\nbody laboriously.\n\nLoah's light was still gleaming. He saw her eyes searching for his,\nhalf in terror, half in wonderment. Strange men with strange\nthundering weapons--he knew she was wondering if they still dared\nhope, wondering if these warriors of Rawson's race might be able to\nwork further magic.\n\nDean put one arm tenderly about her and drew her close and his other\nhand came to rest upon Smithy's shoulder.\n\n\"It's the end, dear,\" he told the girl softly. \"It's the end of our\njourney. You've been so dear and so brave. Pretty tough to lose out\nwhen we'd almost fought clear.\" Then, to Smithy: \"Loah came back to\nsave me--refused to go when she could have got away and been safe.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlready the air was stifling. The tunnel beyond the mouth of the cave\nwas hot, though only at its end, where the invisible ray struck the\nrock surface squarely, was there red, glowing heat. Rawson suddenly\nsaw none of it. He was seeing in his mind the world up above, his own\nworld of great, free, sunlit spaces. Suddenly he was hungry for some\ncloser link, no matter how slight, to bind him to that world.\n\n\"What day is it?\" he asked. \"Have you kept track of time?\"\n\nSmithy looked at him wonderingly. \"Yes,\" he said, then added: \"Oh, I\nsee. You want to know what day this is when we die. It's the\ntwentieth, Dean\"--he looked at the watch on his wrist--\"just two\no'clock, the afternoon of the twentieth.\"\n\nWithin him, Rawson felt a dull resentment. He was being denied even\nthis last trifling solace. \"You're wrong,\" he said sharply. \"You\nslipped up on your count.\"\n\n\"It doesn't make any real difference,\" Smithy said. But Rawson went\non:\n\n\"We left the inner world on the nineteenth. At noon on the twentieth\nGor was to cut loose the flame-throwers, melt a hole in the floor of\nthe ocean. But it didn't work. I had hoped I could wipe out the\nmole-men, turn a solid stream of water down a shaft for over six\nhundred miles. It would have gone through the Zone of Fire, come\nflooding up into the mole-men world and spread out all over down deep\nwhere it's hot. It would have hit the Lake of Fire--all that!\"\n\n\"I don't know what you are talking about, Dean.\" Smithy's voice was\nintentionally soothing; he knew Rawson was talking wildly. \"But I know\nI am right on the time. We've kept track of it every hour since--\"\n\nRawson's talk had sounded like insanity in Smithy's ears. He would\nhave gone on--he didn't want to see Dean Rawson go out like that--but\nnow he stopped. The rock was quivering beneath his feet.\n\nAnd now Rawson, with a wild wordless cry, threw himself toward the\nflame-thrower on the floor. His voice rose to what was almost a\nscream. \"It's worked!\" he shouted in a delirium of joy. \"It's the end\nof the brutes!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen, in words which the others could not comprehend but which somehow\nfired them with his own emotion: \"Gor has cut it loose! Water,\nmillions of tons of it! The Zone of Fire--steam!...\" He threw himself\nflat on the floor as close to the hot mouth of the cave as he dared\ngo, and the green flame of his weapon ripped outward and up as he\naimed it.\n\nFrom the passage, where it sloped downward toward the source of the\nheat ray, the sound of shrill, whistling voices had swelled louder.\nThe whole tunnel now glowed green from the flames of an advancing\nhorde. They were bringing their ray projector with them, Rawson knew,\nnot that its beam was visible, but the white, dazzling glow from the\nend wall where the tunnel turned was still there.\n\n\"Shoot above me!\" Rawson shouted. \"Don't stick your guns out into that\nray, but aim as straight down the tunnel as you can. Keep 'em busy.\nKeep 'em from coming too close.\"\n\nAbove his head he heard the beginning of rifle fire as the men crowded\nclose to aim at the opposite wall at as flat an angle as they could.\nThe air grew shrill with the sound of ricochets as the bullets\nglanced, but still the enemy came on, as their screeching voices told.\n\nHis own weapon was aimed up above. The roof of the tunnel was rough\nand broken. He directed the flame against the top of a great black\ngranite block. In one place it was fractured. If he could cut it off\nabove, make it fall to the steeply slanting floor.... He worked the\nfull force of the blast methodically along the line he had chosen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe air of the tunnel had been blowing gently, but now it came in\nsharp gusts that whipped in through the mouth of the cave, while it\nbrought an unending growl and roar like distant gunfire from deep\nwithin the earth. The breeze had swelled to a steady blast when the\nrock crashed down.\n\n\"But that's no use,\" Culver had shouted, when the deafening sound of\nits fall had ceased. \"They'll melt it in a second with their ray.\"\nEven as he spoke the great mass of granite softened and rolled\ndownward as the enemy shot their ray on its lower side. The heat of it\nstruck blastingly into the entrance to their retreat, yet still Rawson\nkept on, sawing doggedly with the weapon of flame at other great\nblocks above.\n\nNow that distant thunder grew hugely in volume, and again the rocks\ntrembled beneath them. The wind in the tunnel grew suddenly to a wild\nblast. It brought to them from a thousand other passages, the shrill,\ndemoniac shrieking of air that was torn and ripped on projecting\nledges of rock. Mingled with it was the sound of voices that screamed\nin terror, and the echo of feet running in mad flight down the tunnel.\n\nThe mass of stone, that had been melting under the invisible ray,\ncooled to red, then to black. Outside, the tunnel, now a place of\nroaring winds, was lighted only by the single flame of Dean's weapon.\n\n\"They've gone!\" Culver shouted. \"The ray's off. Get outside! Now we'll\nrun for it!\" And, with the others, Rawson sprang to his feet and\nleaped out into the tunnel which was no longer a place of death.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe heard the sound of their hurrying feet and a voice that cried:\n\"Look out for the turn--the rock's hot,\" but he did not look after\nthem. He was standing squarely, bracing himself in the blast of air,\nstill directing the flame upon a block that hung stubbornly and would\nnot let go.\n\nHe knew that Loah alone stood near. He heard other feet; someone was\nreturning. Then Smithy was upon him, almost jarring him from his\ncareful pose. Smithy was shouting.\n\n\"Come back, Dean!\" he cried. \"Are you crazy? Don't you know they'll be\nafter us again?\"\n\nRawson sprang as the big rock let go. It, too, crashed deafeningly\nupon the floor and rolled sluggishly downward beside the high hummock\nof glass that the first rock had become. They bulked hugely in the\npassage. They were eight or ten feet high, reaching across from one\nwall to the other.\n\nAbove them was still a space of four feet; Rawson estimated it\ncarefully while he looked at the ceiling above. Then he shook off\nSmithy's hand that was dragging at him and returned to the attack; for\nnow, above the top of the barricade he had built, white ribbons of\nvapor were streaming. He had to shout to his utmost to make Smith hear\nabove the shrill shriek of the blast.\n\n\"Steam!\" he screamed into Smithy's ear. \"Live steam! We could never\nmake it--before we got to the top we'd be cooked to a pulp. I've got\nto block it, got to seal it off.\" A whole section of the ceiling tore\nloose as he spoke, and the wind raised its voice like the scream of a\nwounded animal--or the cry of an overwhelmed and stricken people--as\nit tore through the space that remained.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt whipped the molten drops as they fell and made of them a deadly\nrain. Rawson, staring through the clouds of hot steam that now wrapped\nhim about, called to Smithy to take Loah to safety, and kept the flame\nwhere it should be--until at length the last aperture was closed, the\nlast gap in the wall filled in. And even after that Rawson kept the\nflame still playing above that wall till he had melted rock and more\nrock that flowed down to make the barrier a single heavy, solid mass.\n\nSteam was coming now from the narrow cleft where the green light had\nflashed out to bar their way. But that was simple, and he sealed the\ngap shut with his flame.\n\nHe was gasping. The radiant heat from that molten mass had been\ntorture that his naked body could never have borne but for the\ndesperate necessity that drove him.\n\nSmithy and Loah were again beside him. \"Now,\" he choked, \"we can go,\nbut if there are any cross passages I'll have to block them too.\"\n\n\"There aren't,\" said Smithy, and added: \"I thought you were crazy.\nYou've saved us all, Dean; we never could have made it to the top.\nThat steam was getting hot--hot as if it had come right out of hell.\"\n\n\"It did,\" said Rawson. Then the flame-thrower fell from his nerveless\nhand. He was swaying; his knees were trembling with weakness when\nSmithy and Loah, on either side, took his burned arms tenderly and\nhelped him on where the others had gone.\n\nColonel Culver and a rescue party met them halfway. The Colonel had\nseen his men safely to the bottom of the volcanic pit. Others had run\nfrom their station beside a field gun to meet them; then Culver had\ncalled for volunteers and had gone back. And now there were plenty of\nwilling arms to help.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe big lift, with its platforms of metal plates, awaited them at the\ntunnel's end. There was room on it now for all who were left; there\nwas no crowding of men's bodies as there had been on the downward\npassage. Rawson was stretched on the floor-plates, whose touch was\ncool to his tortured body. Loah was seated that his head might rest\nin her lap on that absurd little fragment of skirt. She bent above\nhim, whispering brokenly: \"Dean-San--my dear--my own Dean-San! We\nlive, Dean-San. I can scarcely believe it, but I know that we live,\nfor I still have you.\"\n\nBut Dean was able to stand when that journey was done. First, though,\nthere were men who placed him carefully on a stretcher and carried\nhim, when he commanded, to the crater's outer rim. On the ashy floor\nof the crater a big transport was waiting with idling motors, but Dean\nwould not let them put him inside. He wanted to look out across the\nworld, to see it in reality as he had seen it in his own mind when all\nhope was gone. He wanted to look out once more across Tonah Basin and\nlet his eyes rest upon country he had known.\n\nLoah and Smithy walked beside him, as the first-aid men carried him\ntoward that distant rim. The rocks there were cleft--it was the place\nwhere he first had seen the inside of the crater's cup. There he had\nthem put him down; and, with the help of Loah and Smithy, he got\nslowly to his feet. While they lifted him, he wondered at the sound in\nthis desert world where no sound should be. A terrific rushing, an\nendless roar--and then his eyes found the clouds of steam.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBelow him was the Basin, the tangled wreckage of his camp. And there,\nwhere the derrick had stood, was a tall plume of white. It did not\nbegin close to the ground--superheated steam, until it cools and\ncondenses to water vapor, is invisible--but a hundred feet above the\nsand. And, from there on up, two thousand feet sheer into the air, was\na straight shaft of vapor, rolling up for another thousand feet into\nbillowing clouds that the afternoon sun turned to glorious white.\n\n\"Power!\" gasped Rawson. \"Power--and it will be like that\nindefinitely!\" Then he laughed weakly. \"I had to go down there to do\nit, to make Erickson richer, but it was worth it. In there the ocean\nwill slowly subside. Gor and his people will find their lost lands;\nthe column of water in the shaft will hold the back-pressure of steam.\nAnd here, I have Loah, and that's all--but that's enough!\"\n\nHe put one arm, still with the bandages of the first-aid men, about\nthe girl. \"I hope you'll be happy, dear,\" he said softly, and turned\nback. But Smithy barred the way.\n\n\"That isn't all,\" said Smithy jubilantly. \"You see, Dean, Erickson\nfired you--Erickson thought you had run out on him. Instead of backing\nyou up, he quit. So I bought them all out. Whatever is there,\nDean--and it's worth more millions than I dare to think about--you own\nhalf of! Now get back on that stretcher. Just because you've saved all\nour necks up here on top of the earth, you mustn't think you can keep\nan Army ship waiting all day!\"\n\n(_The End._)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Two Thousand Miles Below, by Charles Willard Diffin\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TWO THOUSAND MILES BELOW ***\n\n***** This file should be named 29965.txt or 29965.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/9/6/29965/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
