To Dream of Stars_\n\n\nThat morning began like all the preceding mornings of the past two\nyears with the tinny jangling of the little alarm clock on Robin\nCarew's bureau. Opening his black eyes, he struggled into a sitting\nposition on the narrow bed, reached out his hand and turned off the\nalarm. He yawned, swung his feet to the floor, rubbed his eyes. It was\nhalf past seven again of another workday morning.\n\nThere was no inkling that this day would be any different from others.\nIt was Monday again, which meant the start of the next five and a half\ndays' stretch of work. Sunday had come and gone, now just a memory\nof a walk in the city's small park and sitting on a bench under the\nafternoon sun reading a library book on astronomy.\n\nWell, there was no getting around it, Robin thought. The stars, the\nglory of the heavens--for him perhaps they would always be just a\ndaydream of his idle hours, never to be more than a vision of the\nimagination, a thrill to be shared only by the printed words of other\nmen's observations and doings.\n\nHe got up, yawned his entire five foot three, stared in the tarnished\nmirror over the worn bureau. He looked blankly at himself, then\nsuddenly winked. Ah, he thought, while there's life there's hope--and\nbesides, he had to get to work. He ran a brush through his tousled\nbrown hair, took off his pajamas, and climbed into his work clothes.\nGrabbing his towel and his toothbrush, he opened the door and went out\ninto the hall toward the washroom.\n\nThe facilities at the Y were always clean at least, and maybe in a few\nmore months he would be promoted out of the apprentice class at the\nfactory. Then he could afford to get a bigger room on the floor above\nwith his own washstand and shower.\n\nAfter he had returned and finished dressing, he glanced out the narrow\nwindow. He could just make out a slit of sky and spot the sidewalk\nbelow. It was a sunny day, he saw, and a warm one. Putting on his\njacket, he left his cap behind and went out, locking the door of his\nlittle room behind him.\n\nNot waiting for the creaky elevator, he skipped down the iron stairs to\nthe lobby. Waving hello to a couple of his fellow boarders, he made his\nway over to the newsstand. There he paused to glance at the headlines,\nto scan the racks of magazines to see if there were any he might think\nof buying that he hadn't seen before. He didn't notice any. His eye,\nrapidly discarding the featured stories in the papers about the usual\ncrimes and politics, was caught by a small heading:\n\n     ROCKET PROGRAM AHEAD OF SCHEDULE--PROJECT CHIEF\n     REPORTS TESTS ARE MANY MONTHS ADVANCED!\n\nRobin stopped, rapidly glanced over the story. He wished he had the\ntime to read the whole story, but he knew he hadn't. Anyway, he could\nprobably borrow a copy during lunch hour from one of the fellows. But\nit was stories like that which fascinated him.\n\nAs he went into the cafeteria at the Y and sat eating a quick\nbreakfast, he thought about the story. He'd always been fascinated by\nrockets and the stars. Even when still a kid at the orphanage, he'd\nread everything he could get on the subject. He'd never stopped doing\nso. Now that he was out of the school, out on his own the past three\nyears, he still had the bug.\n\nThe White Sands and Redstone rocket experiments were making headlines\nmore and more. The first dozen little satellites had been thrilling\nreading--the discussions of the permanent artificial satellite\nprogram, now under way, was even more so, for it promised to be the\nbeginning of the long-projected Space Platform, from which in turn\nwould come the first real space flight.\n\nRobin wished he knew more of the things that were going on. Somewhere\nout there in the West, on the deserts and sands of New Mexico a couple\nof thousand miles away, history was being made. Many of the fellows\nworking there couldn't be much older than he.\n\nBut fate was a grim and arbitrary thing. For others, a college\neducation could bring to a fine point the talent for mathematics and\nchemistry and physics that was needed for this work. For an orphan\nboy, however, the world reserved less glamorous and more immediately\npractical objectives. Oh, sure, he'd had a chance at a scholarship, but\nsomehow he just hadn't made it. The manual training programs stressed\nat the State Home had just not allowed him the extra time to study for\na scholarship. Even though his instructors had given him the chance, he\nsimply hadn't been able to make it.\n\nFor him, the study of abstract science was to be a matter of home\nreading. He'd devoured all the books in the library on the stars. And\nhe still dreamed, even while working in the carpentry shop of the\nfactory here, of flying through space on wings of flame.\n\nPerhaps, if he'd had a mother and father like most fellows, he'd have\ngone to college, might even now be on his way to help the rocket men\nconquer the universe. But his folks had died somewhere in the holocaust\nof war, back during the fall of Hitler's Germany, back when he was\njust a frightened and helpless kid of seven.\n\nAs he had agreed a thousand times since then, Robin reflected, as he\nspooned cereal to his mouth, he was lucky even so. For somehow the GI's\nhad found a battered, dirty envelope sewn into his worn internment-camp\njacket with identification that proved him the American-born son of\nAmerican parents, who had been interned in the enemy country. But where\nhis parents were ... well, there had been some terrible bombing in\nthose days. There was never any trace of the Carews. Robin had only a\nvague memory of his people, somewhere lost amid a nightmare of terror.\n\nAs most of the kids in the orphanage had, Robin dreamed of someday\nfinding his folks, of finding them rich. But it was, as always, a\ndream. The American army had brought him home, had sought to trace his\nfolks, and had failed. Well, Robin still was lucky. It was no shame to\nbe a workingman in a democratic country.\n\nTime was passing. Robin hastily gulped down the glass of milk he knew\nhe needed for his daily labors, and, paying his check, dashed out. He\ncaught the bus at the corner, crowding in with others on their way, and\nrode it for fifteen minutes out to the edge of town where the big plant\nstood.\n\nHe jumped off and headed for the main gates. He noticed a large crowd\nof men standing in front of them. Why were they standing, he thought,\nwhy didn't they go on in, punch their cards? He came up to them, saw\nthem standing around talking uneasily, some milling around, holding\ntheir lunch pails idly in their hands. Robin pushed through to the main\ngate. He saw a knot of men staring at a sign tacked on the post. He got\ncloser and read it.\n\nIt was a statement from the management. It seemed that the plant was\nclosed for six weeks, due to a combination of circumstances. There was\na shortage in the raw materials because of the heavy floods in the\nmining areas that spring, and so the management had decided to take\nadvantage of that shortage to retool and recondition the works. Men in\nseveral departments would be called in during the next few days, the\nrest would be laid off temporarily. Another notice tacked below that\nstated that the company had arranged with the union for compensation\nduring the period.\n\nRobin stared at the notice numbly for a minute. He himself had not yet\nbeen admitted to the union, for he was only a learning apprentice.\nFor him there would possibly be only a period of six barren, workless\nweeks. He wandered away from the gates, drifted around idly, listening\nto the groups of men talking.\n\nMost of them seemed to be taking it calmly enough. Several of them were\ntalking with growing enthusiasm of organizing a hunting-and-fishing\ntrip upstate for the next week or so. One was talking of going home to\nvisit the old folks back at the farm. Most of them seemed to be looking\nforward more or less to a period of loafing around at home with their\nfamilies.\n\nSuddenly Robin felt more alone than usual. For him, there was no\nfamily. Even at its best an orphanage has a certain coldness, a certain\nimpersonal precision that can never make up for the warmth of family\nlife. He had friends there, but surely by this time they, too, had\nleft, having gone into business or into the armed forces.\n\nThe cold halls of the Y offered no particular relaxation. Even\nutilizing the city library to burrow deep into his favorite imaginative\nstudies of science seemed a barren prospect for six whole weeks.\n\nHe wandered away from the men, walked along the great factory wall,\nhands in his pockets, strolling slowly away from the city, along the\nroad to the open country, beyond the end of the bus lines. He thought\nabout himself. He took stock of himself.\n\nNearly twenty now, he was a good mechanic, a pretty good carpenter,\nhandy. He'd always be able to get a job somewhere in which he could\nwork with his hands. He'd never thought too much though about the\nfuture. He would be taken sooner or later by the armed forces. They\nhadn't needed him and he hadn't thought about volunteering first. He\nwas always a little sensitive about his height, for he was short for\nhis age. This had probably operated subconsciously to keep him from\njoining up.\n\nI could sign up now, he thought. This might be the time. Besides, he\nwent on in his reasoning, if I volunteered I could pick my own branch\nof the service. I could pick the Air Force and maybe get to see some\nrockets and jets in action. I couldn't rate a pilot's commission\nbecause I'm no college man, but I bet I could qualify as a mechanic,\nget to work on the rocket planes. Why, maybe I could even manage to\nget sent to White Sands, work on the Space Platform and the Artificial\nSatellites. Maybe someday I'll be one of the guys who help tool up the\nfirst rocket to the moon!\n\nHe found himself growing excited at the thought. But, he reminded\nhimself, my chances are slim of getting what I want. There are so\nmany good guys in the Air Force, my own chance of being sent to one\nparticular place is small, really small.\n\nSomehow, he knew if he couldn't be around the rockets, he wouldn't be\nhappy under discipline. He'd had enough barracks life in the orphanage,\nmore didn't appeal to him without some special compensation--something\nlike White Sands.\n\nSo--he had six weeks with nothing to do. He walked on, beyond the town\nnow, alongside the highway, the morning sun shining down, the blue sky\nbeaming overhead, and he began to feel himself swelling with energy,\nglowing with ambition.\n\nSix weeks ... six weeks. He was young, he had no ties. Maybe he could\nhitchhike to White Sands in time to look around, maybe spot a rocket go\nwinging off into the sky, then hitchhike back in time for the factory's\nreopening.\n\nThe idea blazed into his mind, he felt his pulse beating\nuncontrollably. Maybe, maybe, his mind added to the picture, maybe\nyou could get a job in White Sands, near the field. Maybe they hire\ncivilian workers? Or--maybe if you enlist there they'll let you serve\nthere?\n\nAbruptly he turned around, started walking rapidly back to the city.\nHe'd do it, he told himself excitedly. He'd do it. He'd go back to the\nY now, today, collect what he needed, take the few dollars he'd saved\nup, and go.\n\nHis mind repeated a rhythm as he walked. Do it now, if you don't do it\nnow, you'll never do it. This is your chance. Go. The West is calling.\nThe rockets are calling. Make a break for yourself. Go!\n\nHe reached the end of the bus line, hopped on the bus, vibrated in tune\nto his racing thoughts all the way back.\n\nBut an hour and a half later, when he was standing in the bus terminal,\nthe first flush of excitement had drained away. Now he felt a cold\nchill running through him. He had made the break, packed a few\nnecessities, drew his small reserve of cash from the bank, paid his\nroom rent six weeks in advance, and bought a ticket on the bus going\nwestward.\n\nHe couldn't afford the entire trip to New Mexico, so he bought passage\nfor a few hundred miles. After that he'd hike and thumb rides the rest\nof the way. He didn't want to resort to charity so he had kept enough\nfunds to keep him in food and lodgings if necessary and maybe take him\npart way home again.\n\nFor a moment before boarding the bus, Robin hesitated. Was it after all\nbut a daydream that he was pursuing? Was the cold reality to prove too\nindifferent to the hopes of just an ordinary young fellow? Would White\nSands prove a disappointment? Was this a mistake he would regret?\n\nFor just a second he hesitated and then, shaking his head angrily as\nif to drive out such thoughts, he stepped aboard the bus, slung his\nlightly packed valise onto the rack over an empty seat, and sat down.\nHe would refuse to give up his vision. He would see this through.\n\nThe horn honked, two or three more passengers swung aboard, the driver\nthrew in the clutch, and the bus drove out of the terminal, along the\nlong, dusty road west.\n\n\n\n\n_2. White Sands or Red?_\n\n\nFrom Missouri where the bus ride had ended, the time had passed with\ndifficulty. There had been two hot days through Kansas, standing by\nlonely roadsides while cars whizzed by without stopping, the strong sun\nbeating down over the flat green plains, the insects alive with the\nfever of the endless wheat. Robin had to keep heading south, south and\nwest always, driving down when cars were going that way. Down through\nOklahoma, thumbing his way, sometimes with an Eastern tourist on his\nway to California, sometimes with a tired rancher or oil worker on a\nshort haul to his home or town, sometimes with a bored truck driver\nanxious to have someone to talk to on the long trip.\n\nThe closer he drew to his objective, the more excited he became. When\nthe oil fields and gray lands of Oklahoma began to turn to the green\nflatness of the Texas Panhandle he grew silent, more intense. And\nfinally, one morning when he sped out of Amarillo sharing the high\nfront seat of a giant trailer truck bound for El Paso, he was almost\nspeechless for miles and miles. Then, suddenly, as the road clicked\nacross the invisible border of New Mexico, he began to talk. A sudden\ncalm invaded his nerves. He talked with the driver about things back\nhome, exchanged comments on the affairs in the news, his eyes taking\nstock of this land all the time.\n\nIt was barren--for vast stretches dry desert and flat rock with\nonly sparse clumps of desert green--now and then a stretch of good\ngrasslands where cattle could be seen grazing. In the distance, gaunt\nmountain chains rose and fell; and the air was getting clear and thin\nas the road gradually rose in altitude.\n\nAfter a bite in Roswell, when he piled back into the truck, Robin knew\nhe was on his last stretch. After the next stop, Alamogordo, he would\nreach his destination, Las Cruces. Mention of Alamogordo, though, set\nthe driver talking about the atom bomb, for that had been the town that\nhad first seen the birth of that eerie fire which seemed so destined to\ntransform the world.\n\n\"Did you ever see one of those blasts?\" asked Robin quietly.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said the driver slowly. \"Guess you could say so. Didn't\nactually see the thing itself, but I seen the glare one morning while\nputting over in Alamogordo. Quite a sight. You know the blast was\nplenty far away too; they don't fire them things off anywhere near\nwhere they can hurt anybody. Wisht I'd get to see one of them rockets\ngo up they're always firing off at White Sands too. But I guess you\ngotta be on the grounds for that, and they don't let visitors hang\naround.\"\n\n\"No visitors?\" asked Robin, a little uneasily.\n\n\"Nope. That's all top-secret stuff out there. Now that they got those\nman-made satellite projects in operation, it's even more so. Maybe they\nlet a few reporters in on special occasions, or some high brass with\nclearance from Washington, but nobody else can get in. Can't even get\nthe GI's who are out there to talk much about it. You'll see a lot of\nthem around Las Cruces Saturday nights on furlough but they just don't\ndiscuss it.\"\n\n\"How far is White Sands from Las Cruces?\" asked Robin.\n\n\"Oh, not too far, maybe thirty miles. The proving grounds are out on\nthe desert though, part of the Holloman Air Development Center that\nis taking up a lot of this here Tularosa Basin these years. Without a\npass, you can't even get in sight of it. But, heck, you wouldn't want\nto, I hope. Might get conked when one of those whacking big rockets\ncome down. They're always shooting 'em up on tests, making them bigger\nand bigger. You can't tell me they always know where they're going to\ncome down!\"\n\nThey passed Alamogordo, drove an hour more through the stillness of the\ndesert, and suddenly they were in Las Cruces. The truck drew to a halt,\nand Robin dropped off, his valise in his hand. The city didn't seem\naware of its unique position on the map of world history.\n\nRobin trudged along the main street until he found a small hotel within\nhis means. He got a room, washed from the trip, brushed his clothes.\nHe had not taken any pants to spare, having put on a strong pair of\nkhaki work trousers, figuring correctly that they were more the thing\nfor hitchhiking than his one good Sunday suit. By the time he went\ndownstairs night had fallen.\n\nHe got a bite to eat, walked around the town a bit, went back and to\nbed. He was dog-tired from the long day's ride.\n\nNext day he walked the town, looking it over, asking questions about\nhow to get to White Sands. He found that the truck driver's advice had\nbeen right. There simply was no way a visitor could just go and watch.\nIt was all top-secret stuff, barred to any but legitimate personnel.\n\nHe found an Air Force recruiting office, went in, and talked with the\nsergeant in charge. Robin had begun to dread the thought that in the\nend he might have to go back to his home city and back to work in the\nfactory. He had so fixed his mind on the rockets, he couldn't bring\nhimself to admit defeat now.\n\nThe Air Force man confirmed the usual information. Robin pressed him to\nsay whether if he signed up for the service in Las Cruces he wouldn't\nstand a good chance of being assigned there. The sergeant laughed.\n\n\"Well, it's possible, but it might take a little doing. You get in\nthe Air Force, let us train you for a good job, say you work to be a\nmechanic for jets and rockets, then maybe you might be assigned here.\nBut there are lots of stations for men, and you might not. Still, if\nyou were to work for it, say after a year in service, you might apply\nfor a transfer to White Sands; it could be that you could get it.\nBut there's no guarantee, none at all. If the force needs you more\nsomewhere else, that'll have to be it. Why not sign up and try for it?\"\n\nBut Robin shook his head. \"Not yet. I want to see if maybe I can get a\ncivilian job there first, or maybe just visit it once.\"\n\nThe sergeant nodded. \"You can try. After that, come around and see me\nagain.\" Robin nodded, and left.\n\nHe thought about that as he walked the streets. It might be a good\nalternative. It did offer at least a chance at the work he dreamed of,\nat being near the rockets. Yet--to be so near _now_ and be stopped. A\nyear, even in the Air Force, still seemed a mighty long time to wait.\n\nHe found the civilian employment office for the White Sands Proving\nGrounds, but it was not only closed, it being Saturday afternoon, but\nthere was a sign saying, _No Help Wanted_.\n\nThat night he began to notice men in Air Force dress blues, others\nin GI khaki, and even some in ordinary olive-drab fatigues appearing\nin the streets. He realized it was Saturday night and the streets\nwere beginning to show the signs of life for the men's one night a\nweek in town. Ranchers were driving in, their cars lining the curbs.\nBuses bearing the name of White Sands would come in, unload their\npleasure-hungry men, and park somewhere or else go back. White-capped\nMP's were appearing at corners to augment the local police.\n\nNevertheless, there was mighty little disturbance. There weren't the\nnoisy carryings-on that usually marked towns near army bases when\nsoldiers had a night off. These were picked men, and they behaved\nthemselves.\n\nRobin was not a drinker and not a roisterer, yet that evening he\nwondered if he oughtn't to have been. For if he could have learned\nto hang around some of the livelier bars, he might have been able to\nstrike up conversations with the men of White Sands. After a while, he\ndid indeed enter one, sat nursing a lone beer while listening to the\nmen.\n\nBut they did not talk business. They talked the talk that soldiers on\nleave talk everywhere. Their girl friends, their pals, their latest\njokes, gossip, but never a word about rockets, never a word about\nsatellites, never a whisper about their work.\n\nRobin drifted with the crowd in the streets for several hours, finally\nagain found another corner in a dim tavern where he sat, by this time\na little tired, a little confused, wondering whether he had not made a\nmistake in coming here at all. The whole day had been frustration and\nhis spirits were at low ebb.\n\nTwo men in fatigue denims were seated near him, arguing. One was\nplainly far gone under the influence of liquor. He was bleary-eyed,\nnodding and mumbling. The other, trying to hold him, shaking him, was\nactually almost as far gone. He was mumbling something about getting up\nand going; they had to make the last truck to camp.\n\nFinally the two got up, staggered to the men's room, and disappeared\ninside. Robin resumed his meditations, noting that the place was nearly\nempty now, that the streets were silent. Obviously time had run out for\nthe men, and they were on their way back to camp. Suddenly it occurred\nto him that the two soldiers had failed to come out of the lavatory.\n\nRobin slipped out of his seat, opened the door of the washroom, and\nwent in. The two men were there, together on the floor, sound asleep.\n\nHastily Robin knelt down, shook them. \"Wake up, you got to go back to\ncamp!\" he called. But he couldn't budge them. One mumbled something\nwithout opening his eyes, slumped back, and began to snore. The other\ndidn't even respond that much.\n\nFor a moment Robin stood beside them, thinking that he ought to go and\ntell the proprietor. Then he heard a voice call loudly outside in the\nbar:\n\n\"Any of youse guys going back tonight better step on it! Bus's leaving\nin two minutes!\"\n\nAn MP rounding up the stragglers, Robin thought. And in that moment,\na sudden chill ran through him, a sudden wild thought leaped into\nhis head. He stood transfixed for an instant. For an instant which\nseemed to last an eternity, an instant in which all his training, all\nhis instincts and ambitions fought and struggled together in a mad\nhysteria. Here was an opportunity, here was a chance--yet a trickery,\nan illegality.\n\nIf he borrowed one of the unconscious men's jackets, borrowed his pass,\nhe could ride back to White Sands that very night, and in the dark and\nconfusion, who would know?\n\nNobody, he felt sure. The next day--well, he'd be surely found,\narrested. But--in the meantime, for a blessed hour or so, he would see\nthe rockets in their gaunt glory, in their towering eminences, see an\nassault against the skies, watch the hissing blue flame ascend to the\nheavens, see a sight he would remember with joy the rest of his life.\n\nWhat then if he spent some bad hours under arrest? What even if he went\nto jail? Actually what could they do to him? He was no spy, he was no\nsaboteur. No matter how exhaustive the investigation, it would prove\nnothing evil against him.\n\nHe remembered a sermon that had once been given at the orphanage. He\nremembered the minister dwelling on the opportunities of life. He\nremembered that which had sparked his imagination then, the minister's\ndepiction of the various roads each man must choose. \"There comes a\ntime,\" the speaker had said, \"in every man's life when various roads\nopen out before him, each leading in a different direction. If, at that\nmoment, he makes his choice, then his entire life may be forever set\nupon a channel, and the other possible lives will vanish.\"\n\nWas not this then such a crossroads? Robin could go back, be a factory\nhand, be a contented mechanic or carpenter, marry, settle down, and\nlive his life without ever seeing rockets. Or he could take the road\nthat now, for a brief flicker, seemed open to him.\n\nHe bent down, removed the khaki work jacket the smaller of the two men\nwas wearing, shrugged his own shoulders into it, felt in its pocket,\npulled out a folded piece of paper, glanced at it. _Pass_, it read.\n_Seven hours. Red Sands Station._\n\nHe shoved it into his pocket, pushed open the washroom door, and walked\nrapidly to the street, his head down.\n\nAs he emerged onto the street, he was grabbed roughly by an MP. \"Hurry,\nfeller,\" the man said. \"What station?\"\n\n\"Red Sands,\" muttered Robin in a low voice, and was instantly whirled\naround bodily and given a push. \"Up the street and around the corner.\nThe second bus. Run!\"\n\nRobin broke into a run, dashed around the corner. In the darkened side\nstreet, three buses were warming up, the first already beginning to\nroll. Robin ran for the second, and just as it was pulling away from\nthe curb, several hands reached out of the door, took hold of Robin's\nhands, and heaved him aboard.\n\nHe found a seat in the back of the crowded bus, kept his head down to\navoid having anybody realize he was a stranger, and caught his breath.\n\nThe bus gathered speed, roared down the quiet side streets, and turned\nonto the highway beyond the town. Robin was on his way to the rockets,\nto the famous White Sands Proving Grounds ... or was he? What was the\nRed Sands Station anyway? _Red_ Sands? Why had he never heard of it?\n\n\n\n\n_3. Up the Space Ladder_\n\n\nThe bus roared on through the night, its cargo of men now mainly\nsilent, dozing as their vehicle jolted along. The moon, which was full,\nshed a pale glow over the desolate landscape through which the road ran\nstraight as an arrow. The vehicle had departed from the main highway\nfairly soon after leaving town, and had gone along another leading out\ninto the wastes which was the government reserve. Robin had caught\na momentary glimpse of floodlighted signs warning casual motorists\nagainst the use of the road, warning all that it was U.S. property.\n\nThe men in the bus talked little. Most of them tired, and some a little\nthe worse for a night's revels, were sleeping. Two or three snored\naway, unmindful of the hard seats and the jolting along the road.\nSeated in the back, shoulder to shoulder with several others, Robin\nkept quiet, watching the scene through the open windows and seeing\nwhat could be seen of the terrain without making his observations too\nobvious.\n\nThus far the landscape was the familiar desert of New Mexico, desolate\nand arid flatland with which Robin had become familiar on the trip\ndown. On the horizon he could see the humps of mountains, the peaks\nthat bordered the vast proving grounds.\n\nNear him, a couple of soldiers were conversing in low tones and Robin\ncaught snatches of their conversation. At first it was mainly talk of\nwhat they had seen and done that night, their girl friends, and so on.\nBy and by they began to talk a bit about their work. Robin strained his\nears.\n\n\"I was thinking of asking for a transfer back to White Sands,\" said one\nof the men slowly. \"Some of that new fuel they're bringing in makes me\nreal uneasy.\"\n\n\"Ahh,\" said the other, \"you're just letting that extra security talk\ngive you nerves. Sure, it's supposed to be atomic stuff, new, maybe\neven untested as far as I know, but, nuts, you can't get blown up any\nworse than you can handling that liquid oxygen and peroxide they got at\nWhite Sands. In fact, I understand that this stuff isn't half as tricky\nto pour as the old stuff.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know. I seen some of it being poured yesterday into that new\nbig fellow they're lining up for tomorrow. But the point is that even\nif it's easier to pour--none of that fizzing and spitting you get when\nyou leak a drop or two--it's atomic. That's the thing, atomic. What\nwould happen if a White Sands rocket blew ... it'd be a big bang, sure\nenough, but it wouldn't blow the whole countryside to bits. But take\nthis new stuff ... whew ... we'd all be one Bikini if it went off all\nat once.\"\n\nThe other soldier was silent a moment. \"Well,\" he said finally, \"could\nbe. On the other hand, I heard them say that it is really not half\nas explosive as the old stuff. That loxygen they use in the original\nVikings is really dangerous, will go off quick at any spark. But this\nnew stuff, it won't actually go off until it's touched off after the\nrocket has gone up a few miles. It's actually hard to blast--and then I\nunderstand they ain't sure it'll work.\"\n\nThe other one nodded. \"Uh uh, so they say, but you notice where they\nmoved our outfit, didn't you? They don't want to blow the main fields\nout of existence by accident, just in case they might be a little\nwrong. So they invented this Red Sands layout. I don't even like the\nname.\"\n\nThe soldiers fell silent awhile. Robin turned these words over\ncarefully. He had read nothing of any Red Sands operation, and\nhe remembered nothing of any talk about atomic fuels. In fact\nhe'd understood that the problem was still one they had failed to\nsolve--though the idea was intriguing.\n\nChemical fuels, he knew, had definitely limited drive capacities. The\nmost powerful chemical fuels possible even theoretically were those\nalready in use, and were basically merely liquid oxygen and liquid\nhydrogen. And he knew that the main obstacle that always had to be\nfaced by rocket engineers was the tremendous quantities and weights of\nthe fuels to be burned in order to lift even a single pound of cargo.\n\nAtomic power, if liberated, had on the other hand almost unlimited\npossibilities as fuel. A mere pound or so of atomically liberated\nmaterial could probably drive a spaceship a million miles with a full\npay load too. But how to combine atomic explosions with controlled\nrocket fire? The problem had never been answered--at least not in the\nmagazine and newspaper stories he had ever read.\n\nHe thought about it awhile. Then the bus honked its horn. Robin\ncraned his neck, looked forward. He saw they were paralleling a high\nwire fence and coming to a lighted area. A large sign on a wide road\nentrance branching off caught his eye and he read the magic words,\n_White Sands_.\n\nFor a moment he thought the bus was going to enter as the driver slowed\ndown. They came abreast of the gateway but the driver merely honked\nand waved and passed it by, Robin catching a glimpse of whitewashed\nbarracks and low hangarlike structures beyond the gate. Then they\nroared on into the moonlit night, on toward the empty reaches of the\ndesert where the mountains loomed dark in the horizon.\n\nWhere was Red Sands? How far? Robin speculated on it. He had evidently\nhit on something more than he'd reckoned. This was a development\nunknown to the public. This was something that must have combined the\nspecial nature of the Los Alamos atomic testing grounds with the rocket\ngrounds. And it was obviously tucked far away from them all.\n\nSuppose they caught him there, would he get off as lightly as he\nmight at White Sands? Where atomics was concerned, secrecy was\nstill enforced, despite the release of much information due to the\ninstallation of peaceful atomic plants in various parts of the world.\nBut everyone knew that the world was still merely at the threshold of\natomic glories and the nations were still anxiously vying with each\nother for leadership.\n\nHe supposed that perhaps he might be sent to jail. He might perhaps be\nconfined to the Red Sands grounds until such time as what he was to\nlearn had become public property. That might take years! Robin squirmed\na little as he thought over this possibility. It didn't appeal to him.\nYet, the die was cast and there was now little he could do about it.\n\nHe could, he thought, surrender now to the men in the bus. In that\nway, he'd be stopped from entering the forbidden area at all and might\nthen merely get a bawling out and be released. But something in him\nabsolutely rebelled at the thought. This far he had gone, this far he\nhad moved toward the realization of a dream that had held him from\nchildhood. He would go on, and if he were to pay the penalties for\ntrespassing, he would at least see what he was paying for. Maybe,\nmaybe, he would yet see a rocket go off.\n\nWhat was it the soldier had said, \"that big fellow ... for tomorrow.\"\nThen Robin would be in time.\n\nThe bus roared on for what seemed at least another hour. Finally it\napproached another fenced-in area, slowed down, and came to a halt\nbriefly before a guarded gateway. The men stirred in their seats, the\nsleepers were nudged awake, everyone started to squirm around. The\ndriver exchanged a few words with the guards, the bus shifted gears,\nrolled slowly through the gate, and came to a stop. Stiffly the men\nbegan to climb out.\n\nRobin waited until about half the men had preceded him, then, keeping\nhis head low, followed. As the men jumped down from the bus, they\nstepped up to an MP standing by and showed him their passes. He\nexamined each with a flashlight, took it, and waved the men on.\n\nRobin's feet hit the ground. Carefully keeping close to the man in\nfront of him, he dug for the pass he'd found in his borrowed jacket.\nHolding it out, he stepped up to the guard. The pass was seized,\nscrutinized, and with a tap of the hand, Robin was waved on.\n\nThe men were striding off in the direction of a group of low, long\nbuildings of the standard army barracks type. Robin took the same\ngeneral direction, casting his eyes about trying to estimate where he\nwas and what was around.\n\nThe moon was high and its light was strong in the clear desert air. A\nfew dim bulbs showed on posts and one or two lights were flashed in\nthe windows of the barracks. The men were heading directly for their\nbeds--and Robin knew he had to head in the same direction if he did\nnot wish to incur suspicion. It was a ticklish moment, for he did not\ndare do anything to arouse the suspicion that he was a stranger here.\n\nIt was a long walk across the parade grounds and he allowed as much\nspace as possible to drag out between himself and the other men. He\ncame closer to the dark barracks buildings, walked along toward a\ndark doorway through which another man had gone. Turning his head he\nsaw no one near him who might be watching, and Robin stepped into the\ndark doorway, then quickly side-stepped, slipped around the side of\nthe building, and walked silently down the dark space between the two\nadjoining barracks.\n\nAt the far end of the structures, remaining hidden in the shadow cast\nby the moon, he looked outward. He could see, stretching out beyond,\nthe level ground of the desert. He could make out the structures of\nwhat looked like hangars and machine shops, and he could see a number\nof vehicles, trucks, and odd cranes parked around. Far away he caught a\nglimpse of something white. Was it a rocket?\n\nHe crouched in the shadow and waited. After a while he heard no more\nfootsteps, he saw the last lights in the barracks flicker out and\nsilence descend on the station. He glanced at his watch. It was about\ntwo in the morning.\n\nSilently he moved out of the barracks' shadow, walked fast and softly\nto the shadow of the nearest truck. Reaching it, he paused, looked\nback. Nothing stirred. Proceeding in that fashion, Robin moved from\nshadow to shadow, keeping as little in the bright moonlight as he\ncould. He reached a building, clearly a tool house. He walked along\nit, went on beyond, passed through the shadowed side of a long hangar,\nfound a narrow roadway leading out to where the mysterious white object\nrested. He walked alongside it, half stooping, but feeling sure that no\none had seen him. The Red Sands Station was silent.\n\nThe white object proved to be a good deal farther away than he'd\nthought. He knew that distances in the desert were very deceptive, felt\nhimself growing tired. Why, this objective might be two or three miles\naway, he realized now, but only increased his pace as if in answer to\nhis tiring frame. The cold, dry desert air was bracing, and nothing\nmoved save the occasional scurry of some tiny rat or lizard.\n\nWhat he had seen was indeed a rocket. It was at first a dot of white.\nThen it grew into a line of white like a snowy tree. As he neared it\nhe realized its true dimensions. It was a tall giant rocket, as tall\nas an eight-story building, long and slim, towering in the desert\nlike an obelisk left by some Aztec ruler. It was held by a framework\nof metal girders, like that of a newly completed building whose outer\nskeleton had not yet been dismantled. Near it stood a truck on high,\nthick wheels which bore a long, cranelike apparatus resembling the\ntentacles of some weird monster-insect. The rocket stood with its four\nwide-flanged fins jutting out near the base.\n\nRobin stopped at its base and stared up. He studied it, saw that it was\napparently segmented, having lines of cleavage that divided it into\nfour parts, the one at the pointed top being the shortest. This was a\nfour-step rocket, he recognized, and knew at that moment that here also\nwas a step beyond what the public knew.\n\nHe walked slowly around it, awed and silent. He noticed now that there\nwas a thin metal ladder running up the standing framework. The crane\nin the truck was for loading the top, he knew, but he could use this\nladder himself to climb up without trying to start the truck-driven\nlift.\n\nHe reached the bottom rung of the skeleton ladder, saw a sign attached\nto the framework. He looked at it, saw a number, apparently the code\ndesignation of this rocket. Glancing over it, the moonlight was not\nstrong enough to allow him to read the words. He looked at the parked\ntruck with the crane, walked over to it, looked inside. He found a\nflashlight in the dashboard compartment, took it. Lying over the seat\nwas a pea jacket. The air was cold and would become colder. Robin\nborrowed it, shrugged into it. He saw a package lying beneath it,\nlifted it. A couple of candy bars it was. The driver must have had a\nsweet tooth. Robin stuffed the candy into the pocket of the jacket,\nwhich had other things in it as well.\n\nHe returned to the rocket, read the work sheet by his flashlight. Most\nof it was incomprehensible. He saw that the sheet referred only to the\nfueling. Steps two, three, and four were fueled. Step one, the big one\nat the base was still empty and he saw that it was marked for fueling\nby five that morning. Firing time, he noted, was set for six.\n\nRobin glanced up. Here was a chance to examine the rocket completely.\nGlancing around again, he swung up the ladder, started the climb. The\nrocket's sides were welded metal, shiny and painted white. The various\nfuel sections were numbered in large black letters and the contents\nlisted. He saw that the first and main fuel chamber occupied half of\nthe length. The three upper sections, already loaded, he remembered,\nwere marked in liters. The name of the fuel was meaningless to him. It\nmust be, he thought, the atomic stuff the soldier had mentioned. This\nrocket could be a huge atomic bomb, he thought, chilled for a moment.\nBut he continued climbing. At the very tip, he saw that two small,\ncircular doors, like the escape hatches of submarines, were set flush\nin the side. One was closed, the upper and larger one was slightly\najar. He reached it, looked in. He flashed his light, peered around. It\nwas a narrow, closetlike space, filling a section of the uppermost tip,\njust beneath the point of the top. It was padded and empty.\n\nRobin looked out from his perch at the top of the ladder. He looked\naway across the desert to the distant buildings of the Red Sands\nStation. He started suddenly. Something was blinking in the distance.\nHe strained his eyes. Two tiny white lights were moving toward him from\nfar away. He heard the distant purr of a motor. A jeep was coming to\nthe rocket from the Red Sands Station. Had they seen his flashlight?\nWere they coming to investigate?\n\nHe glanced desperately downward. The ground seemed so far away. He\ncould never climb down the ladder in time to escape detection. The\njeep was approaching swiftly. What could he do?\n\nIn a flash of inspiration, he saw the open port of the dark\ncloset-space at the rocket's tip. He climbed into it, swinging out from\nthe ladder, hovering over the abyss, swinging his legs into the dark,\npadded interior. He crammed himself into it, found he fitted it neatly\nwith very little room to spare and, grasping the circular door, pulled\nit toward him. It swung shut on its oiled hinges, clicked tightly into\nplace.\n\nRobin crouched down, silent.\n\nFor a while there was dead silence. Robin wondered if he would be able\nto hear anything that went on outside, considering the padding of the\nlittle space. For once he was thankful for being so short. If he'd been\na few inches taller, he'd have found his position very uncomfortable.\nIt was cramped, but not unbearable.\n\nHe strained his ears, finally heard the vibrations of the jeep draw up\nto the base of the rocket and stop. He heard faint sounds which must\nhave been the muffled voices of the jeep's riders. He lay quietly,\nhoping he would not be discovered.\n\nOutside, the jeep had come to a stop and the two men in the front seat\nstared around suspiciously. \"I'd have sworn I saw a light for a moment\nout here,\" said the driver.\n\nThe other scratched his head, looked around. \"I'd better get out and\nlook around, just to be certain.\"\n\nThey both descended from the jeep. One went over and looked into the\ntrucks and carriers, peering under them for possible hideaways. The\nother poked around the scaffolding at the base of the rocket. \"This is\nthe one they're firing off tomorrow, isn't it?\" he asked when the other\njoined him after a moment.\n\n\"Yeah,\" answered his companion, \"or rather this morning. In fact in\nonly a few hours. They've only got to load the main fuel chambers and\nthey're ready.\" He shined his flashlight on the operations chart, the\nsame one that Robin had examined earlier. \"I wonder how come they\nloaded the other three earlier. That's odd. I thought that stuff\ncouldn't hang around too long.\"\n\n\"Don't you know,\" said the other, \"this is that big top-secret\nexperimental job they were working so fast on this week? Something to\ndo with a new kind of fuel, fairly stable but loaded with radioactive\nelements. Some type of new compound which is supposed to add an atomic\ndisintegration impetus when it goes off. Heard one of the engineers\nexplain it as something like plutonium particles in suspension which\nget touched off atomically as they emerge in the rocket blast. They\ndon't know for sure it will work.\"\n\nThe other looked up at the towering structure. \"I guess that's how come\nthey're sending it up first with the regular loxygen fuel--so if the\nwhole thing goes bang at once, it'll be high enough up not to blow the\nrest of us to kingdom come.\" He walked around the base a bit, stopped,\nflashed his light down, and picked up something. It was a cardboard\nsign that had been lying on the ground. He looked at it a moment.\n\n\"Hey, this must have fallen from the cargo chamber,\" he said, showing\nhis comrade the sign.\n\nIt read: _Instruments in place. Do not disturb._ He turned it over. On\nthe back it read: _Ready for loading._\n\n\"I better put this back where it fell from,\" he said, adding, \"but\nwhich side is correct? Did you say they were firing it at six?\"\n\nAt his companion's assent, he said, \"Well, I guess maybe they must have\nloaded the cameras and radio equipment this afternoon. I'll go up, put\nthis back, and check it.\"\n\nThe man started up the ladder, the same one that Robin had climbed a\nshort while before. When he had arrived before the section where Robin\nlay hidden, he tried the circular door of that section. It was tightly\nshut. This signified to him that it was already loaded and without\nfurther thought he carefully attached the little sign reading _Do not\ndisturb_ to the door.\n\nAfter a few more minutes' search, the two men climbed back in their\njeep and drove back to the barracks-grounds.\n\nInside the rocket, Robin had been unable to hear what they had been\nsaying. Their voices came to him heavily muffled and distorted and he\ncould not recognize the words. He heard the man come up the scaffolding\nladder and try the door. But it had been tight and it had not budged.\nThen he'd gone down and a little later Robin had heard the jeep drive\naway.\n\nRobin lay there quietly on the soft padding and wondered how long he\nshould stay in hiding. They might have left a man on guard or they\nmight be keeping an eye on the rocket. If he came out right away, they\nmight spot him. Better wait here a half hour, he said to himself, and\nthen tried to make himself more comfortable.\n\nThe day had been a long one and a tense one. He was more tired than\nhe'd thought. The tiny, cramped cubby-hole in the nose of the rocket\nwas pitch-dark, cushioned, and utterly quiet. Robin rested his eyes.\nBefore he knew it, he was sound asleep. The air was close and became\nstale; Robin's slumber slowly became deep and drugged.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sun rose at five and with it there arrived the men who would load\nand launch the rocket--several truckloads in fact, with a couple of\ntanks of fuel. The volatile liquids were readied for pouring into the\ntanks and chambers of the first and main firing section. The engineers\narrived. They began to check the loads and the preparations.\n\n\"The instruments in place?\" asked Major Bronck, who was in charge of\nthis operation. His assistant, a civilian engineer, glanced up the\nladder.\n\n\"According to the notice up there, they are. I don't remember seeing\nthem installed myself, though. May have been done after we left\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"Who was in charge of them?\" the major asked.\n\n\"Jackson, sir,\" the answer came, \"but he hasn't been in camp today.\nMust have been left overnight in town.\"\n\nThe major frowned. \"Well, I don't see the instruments around so I\nguess he loaded them all right. Sloppy way of doing things, though. I\ndon't like it. In fact, I don't particularly like this whole job. It's\ntoo hasty, too irregular.\"\n\nThe other smiled, shrugged. \"Can't help it. Big rush orders from\nWashington. They wouldn't even let us put this shot off till Monday.\nHad to get a fast test on this atomic fuel. I guess it's another of\nthose things they think the Russians are up to.\"\n\n\"Ahh, that's always an excuse for rushing. But I still say haste makes\nwaste. Well, anyway we've got our orders so off it goes this morning.\nTrackers on the job?\"\n\n\"Sure, they're right on it. But we've still got to load the animals.\nThis is going to be a high flier and the space-medicine people want in\non it. Here's their stuff now.\"\n\nA light truck rolled up and two men came out carrying a crate. One of\nthe automatic rolling cranes lifted them all up to the nose of the\nrocket. There, just below the instrument compartment, they opened\nanother port and installed their burden, shutting the compartment again\nand sealing it.\n\nThe major glanced at his watch, looked around. The main chamber was\nloaded, the tank had departed. At his order, the rolling scaffolding\nwas swiftly detached and driven away. Now the rocket stood alone on its\nown fins, pointing skyward into the pink and orange dawn, its side a\ndazzling white, its nose a bright red, each section banded in green.\n\n\"How far do you think it will go?\" the major asked his assistant.\n\n\"Anybody's guess,\" was the reply. \"The fuel is untested and\nunpredictable. If this trick fuel fails to work, the whole thing will\ngo up maybe six miles and then drop. If the atomic stuff turns into a\nbomb they'll hear the bang in Las Vegas. If it works as they expect,\nit might go up several hundred miles, maybe even more. It could make\na better satellite rocket than the ones we've got up already. In fact\nthat's what they're hoping. They think they may be able to make this\nthe start of a real space-platform program--for once carrying a pay\nload up worth the carrying. But who knows?\"\n\nThe two climbed into a car and drove to where the concrete dugout was\nlocated. Entering it they nodded to the communications men and other\nengineers already gathered. The major took his place at the firing\npanel. He looked at his timer, waited a few minutes. Gradually the\nsmall talk ceased and a hush fell over the little guiding post. The\nmajor reached for the firing button.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBack in the rocket, Robin opened his eyes. The first thing he noticed\nwhen his head cleared from the grogginess of his deep sleep was a\nslight hissing noise somewhere below him. The air felt different in his\nlittle compartment. Somewhere a thin stream of oxygen was escaping into\nthe chamber.\n\nHe twisted around, felt about with his hands, located it. There was a\nthin line of holes along the seam of the padding underneath him. Now\nhe heard other noises. Below him, a faint chattering, a scolding, the\nsound of something scratching. He put his ear down near the hole from\nwhere the air was issuing and listened.\n\nYes, he thought to himself, animals. Somebody put some animals in the\nspace just below me. Sounds like monkeys' chattering. Must be where the\nair is coming from.\n\nHe had a headache. Bad air in here, he thought, and realized that had\nit not been for the animals being placed below him, he might have\nsuffocated in that space. It was then that he fully realized what had\nhappened--that he'd fallen asleep.\n\nThe animals hadn't been there when he had first climbed in. So he must\nhave slept for several hours at least. He squirmed around, reflecting\non it, still not quite gathering his drugged wits together. That meant\nthat the men must have arrived and started work on this rocket again.\n\nHe thought this over, and a great uneasiness came over him. He strove\nto remember something urgent, something he knew he had to bring back to\nmind. Something about five o'clock and six o'clock.\n\nLoading time, launching time. Yes! They were firing this rocket at\nsix! But what time was it now? How long had he slept? He looked at the\nluminous dial of his watch but was chagrined to find it had run down\nand he'd forgotten to wind it.\n\nHe glanced rapidly around his little space, wondering how he could find\nout whether it was already day. Several glimpses of light hit his eyes.\nHe saw that in three or four places there were tiny glass openings no\nlarger than would admit a thick wire. He tried to look through one, but\nall he could see was blue sky. It was morning then.\n\nHe strained his ears for outside noises, truck engines, men talking.\nBut there was not a sound from outside. Only the faint squeakings of\nthe animals below him. He twisted around again to face the little round\ndoor.\n\nIt was padded on the inside, it had no handle there, nothing to get a\ngrip on. He scrabbled in the padding with his fingers, reached the rim,\nand tried to push. There was no give. It was airtight, automatically\nsealed.\n\nHe pushed against it, wondered what to do. He squirmed around against\nthe padding, lay back with his head against the cushioning on the\nopposite side, his back resting on the floor padding, and put his feet\nagainst the side of the little door. Thus braced he was all set to\nshove the strength of his legs against the door in an effort to push it\noutward.\n\nHe was about to do so when the rocket went off.\n\n\n\n\n_4. Riding the Atoms_\n\n\nSuddenly it felt as if a giant had placed his huge palm squarely on\nRobin's chest and was pushing him down. As he tried to exert pressure\nagainst the door, the counter pressure of the invisible hand increased.\nFor an instant Robin was thunderstruck. Had he suddenly become weak?\nWhat was this?\n\nHis first emotion, that of amazement, changed in a split second to one\nof terror at his newly discovered weakness, and again from that to\na feeling of stunned shock. There was no invisible hand! It was the\nrocket itself moving!\n\nWithout thinking, Robin struggled to rise, but his muscles could not\nobey him. In the first seconds the pressure on him was mild, he might\nhave been able to move if he'd given some extra effort. But by the time\nhis astonishment had worn off, the pressure had climbed beyond the\nlimitations of the cramped space and his young muscles.\n\nThe rocket had started slowly as these great towering constructions\ndo. The first blasts barely served to push it away from its launching\nguides. It seemed to tremble in every plate as if precariously perched\nupon the short, furious blast of yellow. Then the fiery tail lengthened\nas the tall, thin metal body rose slowly, lifted like a thin white\npencil on the roaring cataract of burning gases.\n\nNow it was its own length from the ground, now pushing up faster,\ngiving in split seconds the curious impression that it might topple\nover at any instant. But the steady rise gained in speed, the rocket\npushed away from its burning tail ever faster, the fire turned from\nyellow to blue, and within a few more blinks of the eye it was hurtling\ninto the sky, vanishing into a dot, and then was beyond sight.\n\nTo Robin it seemed again as if a giant hand were pressing down. He felt\nit spreading over his body, felt himself being pushed relentlessly by\nsuperior weight against the matting of the compartment floor. His head\nwas thrust down as if by a giant forefinger of this invisible monster\nleaning over him. Now it seemed as if the giant, in maniacal malice,\nwas leaning his weight on his hand, pressing on Robin, trying to shove\nhim through the floor if possible.\n\nHe gasped for breath, could barely catch it against the growing\npressure on his chest. His eyes sank into their sockets and he tried to\nclose them but found the effort too much.\n\nAll about him there was a roaring sound, a humming and thrumming, and\nnow began a thin, piercing whistling, which was the air outside rushing\npast. The whistle rapidly increased to an ear-splitting shriek, then\nvanished, leaving eddies of unheard auditory vibrations. Robin tried\nto close his mouth, which had been forced open by the prying finger of\npressure. He felt as if in another moment he must cave in, be squashed\nflat. His brain reeled dizzily, then suddenly a merciful blackness fell\nover him and he knew no more.\n\nAt that very moment, though he could no longer sense it, there was a\nclick, audible through the length of the vibrating column of metal,\nand the first section snapped off. Its great fuel tanks, so full of\nvolatile gases an instant before, had emptied themselves in a fury of\nchemical combustion. The automatic releases had loosened the whole\nbottom half, the main fuel section, thrust it into space to fall and\nshatter upon the desert miles below. At that same split second, another\nseries of relays touched off the second firing section.\n\nThe new firing tubes blasted into action. Of a design different from\nthose that preceded it, of a design new to the world of man, the\nexperimental jet burst forth. For an instant it seemed as if the\npressure had vanished in the rocket, for a split second the rocket\nstopped accelerating as it waited for the new impact. Then like a blast\nof lightning newly released from a storm, a shot of energy flashed\nthrough the racing metal body. The giant hand came down on everything\nwithin it with a firmness and power not sensed before.\n\nThere was a blast now emerging from the tail of the flying rocket\nsomething like that of an atomic bomb, but not quite. It was not\nan explosion, but an atomic reaction. It was a rocket flare of an\nintensity and heat beyond all the potential of mere chemical reactions.\nIt was atomic fire, chained and harnessed to the tail of a rocket.\n\nThe thin white pencil, reduced in length, raced on into the dark\nstratospheric sky.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBack at Red Sands there was intense excitement in the control dugout.\nMajor Bronck was racing around, anxiously yelling into telephones,\nwatching the checkers, trying to keep track of everything happening at\nonce.\n\nAt first the ascent had been neat and according to routine. The crew in\nthe dugout, the radar crew at the main camp, and the one co-operating\nwith them from White Sands itself were checking all right. Then in an\ninstant all three almost lost touch as their objective nearly swooped\nout of range. The trackers fought to get it back in focus, and one by\none finally caught it again, farther and faster than they had planned\nfor.\n\n\"It's running wild!\" was the way one startled crew chief told the\nmajor. \"Going up and out like crazy!\"\n\nThe crew on the tracking telescopes racing around the desert were\ncalling in their story. Visually they had lost it completely. They had\ngotten a nice set of telescopic photos of the first phase, then they\nhad failed to adjust quickly enough to the unexpected second phase. Now\nthey were sweeping the sky desperately hoping to pick it up again, but\nwithout success.\n\nMajor Bronck called for a check on the last and surest guide. Among the\ninstruments loaded in the nose of the rocket was a radio tone-signal\nsender. As a last resort, they should be able to pick up that signal\nfrom the rocket itself, confirm the story they were getting from their\nradar men. But the men at the radio listening posts reported no sound.\nAnd when the major asked if they had had it in the first place, the men\nadmitted that they had not. There had never been any buzz on the ether\nfrom the rocket at all!\n\nAt that moment, the main Red Sands camp got on the phone. A voice from\nthe commander's office wanted to know why the instruments had not been\nloaded. It seems that the man responsible for them had just turned up\nat camp. Jackson had reported his jacket stolen, his pass along with it.\n\nTherefore the instruments for whose installation he had been charged\nwith were still reposing in the camp! There had been a series of\nbungles, the major thought, as he tried to explain the situation.\nObviously the rocket had not been checked as it should have been.\nObviously whoever had calculated the course and power of the new fuels\nhad erred very considerably.\n\n\"But we've still got it on radar. Yes, sir. We'll hold it. We'll\ndefinitely see where it comes down, sir.\"\n\nThe major listened, white-faced, to the commander's angry spluttering.\n\"Yes, I know, sir. Top-secret stuff. But even if it lands a thousand\nmiles away, we'll know, we'll spot it. Even if it managed to assume a\nsatellite orbit, we could keep track of it. It's still going straight\nup. It might make an orbit. If it did, there'd be no chance of it\ncoming down intact for foreign examination. It would probably circle\nthe Earth a few times in a wild ellipse and then burn up in the\natmosphere. We won't lose it.\"\n\nBut lose it they did. The radars held it for two hours more, until\nfinally it was beyond even the limits of their extended capacities. It\nwas going up, up, and out, and even at the last there was no sign of it\nslowing down enough to form an orbit.\n\nWhen they finally checked it off as permanently lost, they knew they\nhad witnessed the dawn of a new era. This rocket had assumed and passed\nthe escape velocity. It was headed out into the trackless bounds of\nouter space. It would never return to Earth.\n\nThere was even speculation that its last known course might intersect\nthe Moon's orbit. Opinion in Washington, after all the reports were\nin, was divided on that. But, in spite of the bungling, the rocket had\nproved a valuable point. From that day onward, rocketry in the United\nStates took a new tack.\n\nRobin Carew was dreaming. He was falling down an elevator shaft,\nfalling swiftly floor after floor. Looking down at him from the space\nat the top of the high shaft was a gigantic face, leering at him while\nstretching a giant arm down the shaft trying to reach him.\n\nIn his dream he had the curious mixed-up feeling of wishing the giant\ncould catch him and stop his fall and at the same time being afraid\nthat the giant might be successful and crush him in his huge fingers.\nHe was falling, falling, and squirm as he might, the bottom of this\nterrible shaft was nowhere in sight.\n\nRobin thrashed around, trying to grab a cable, trying to catch one of\nthe innumerable doors as they rushed past. He banged his hand against\none, grabbed tight, jerked.\n\nHis eyes snapped open, his mind struggled to gain a grasp of where\nhe was. Nothing seemed to make sense. It was dark and he was bumping\naround in a tiny, tight space. Yet somehow he couldn't get his feet\ndown, he still was falling. Suddenly he felt dizzy and then became\naware of the aches all over his body.\n\nHe stopped thrashing, let himself rest. He bumped against the tight\nside again, took the opportunity to stretch his body out straight and\nfound he could not. He was touching both sides of the narrow space.\n\nHis eyes found the space not entirely dark. A faint trace of light\nshowed from a couple of spots somewhere in the dark enclosure. He\nrealized where he was. He remembered now the take-off, the pressure.\nWhy, he thought with a shock, the rocket went off. And I'm in it! We\nmust be falling back to the sands now. In a few minutes we'll crash and\nthat will be the end.\n\nHe waited awhile, expecting to be snuffed out at any instant. But\nthere was nothing. Just silence. And now a faint rustling sound where\nsomething was stirring and squeaking below him. The animals, he\nthought, are alive in the space below me.\n\nThen it occurred to him that he was not falling back, but perhaps\nfalling away. His mind, which had been numbed from the pain and\npressure, began to reassemble what he knew about rockets. And\nconsciously the thought formed--the sensation of free fall is the same\nas the sensation of weightlessness found in space rockets. He thought\nhe was falling, but was it not just as likely that instead he was\nsimply beyond gravity?\n\nHe felt himself over for broken spots, but somehow miraculously he had\nnot been damaged. His eyes burned and he supposed they were bloodshot.\nA smear of stickiness around his face convinced him he'd suffered a\nnosebleed. But otherwise he was sound. He patted the jacket he wore and\nhis hand encountered the cylindrical hardness of the flashlight he'd\nborrowed from the supply truck. He took it out, snapped it on.\n\nThe little padded compartment was the same, the door still tightly\nwedged. He turned the light carefully around it, saw that the\nfaint break in the total darkness before had come from two tiny\nopenings--glass insets. Probably, he thought, the openings for the\ninstruments, possibly the lens spots for cameras.\n\nHe switched off his flashlight, put an eye to an opening. The spot\nof glass was thick but amazingly clear. He caught a glimpse of\nblue-black sky and a jagged line of misty gray and white, beneath which\nstretched the edge of a great brown-and-green bowl. He stared at it in\npuzzlement, watching it as it swung slowly away.\n\nHe realized that the rocket had developed a slow spin, that his viewing\nspot would gradually circle the region around him. And he realized that\nthe great brownish bowl was the Earth.\n\nFrom the darkness of the sky he realized that he must already be high\nin the stratosphere, possibly well beyond it. From the curvature of the\nhorizon, he must be far up, several hundred miles, he guessed. And he\ncould see that the curvature was increasing as he watched. The rocket\nwas still traveling upward, traveling at an immense rate of speed.\nIts last rockets had blasted away and had left it with a heritage of\nunparalleled speed.\n\nRobin screwed up his eyes again, mentally calculated. He revised his\nestimate of his height, doubled it, redoubled it. Why, he might be a\nthousand miles up, two thousand, perhaps many times that! How fast was\nhe traveling?\n\nHe didn't know. He couldn't tell. He remembered the talk about\natomic fuels he had overheard. Could it be that the inventors had\nmiscalculated? Could it be that he was already in outer space, heading\nfor the void, never to return to Earth?\n\nHe screwed his eye again to the outlet. In the short time since he'd\nfirst looked the sky had darkened. It was black, jet-black, and the\nstars were fiery points of white. The Earth now seemed like a ball, a\nvast ball whose fringes glowed with the pale mistiness of a sun-lit\nblanket of air. But where he was there was no air. He was beyond any\natmosphere. No whistling of atmospheric friction was present in the\nlength of the silent rocket.\n\nAnd then a blinding white glow poked a piercing beam through the tiny\neye-spot. It was the sun, unshielded, brilliant. In a moment the tiny\nray vanished as the rocket continued its slow turning, but Robin in\nthat instant had come to realize what had happened.\n\nHe was in outer space, beyond Earth, never to return. He was the first\nman to reach that untracked void that bounded on all the stars and\nsuns of a universe. He was the first--but who would ever know? Who\ncould ever hear of him, whose helpless body, imprisoned in its shining\nairtight shell, now seemed doomed to float unsuspected forever on the\ncosmic tides of interplanetary space?\n\n\n\n\n_5. Fall Without End_\n\n\nFor a moment Robin felt dizzy again, and the falling sensation wracked\nhim. It was the weightlessness, he knew. The sensation of being without\nweight was the same as that of being in free fall. And he was operating\nbeyond the effects of gravity. Somehow the atomic rocket fuels had been\nfar greater or far more effective than the inventors had calculated. He\nknew that they had never intended this rocket to be shot beyond Earth's\ngrip--for if they had, they would not have loaded it with the test\nanimals and they would not have placed a parachute-release arrangement\nin the nose.\n\nHowever, it now occurred to him he might be wrong about this. He had\nseen the reference to the parachute on the loading chart, and he now\nremembered lettering indicating parachute on the body of the rocket\njust above the little entryway to the topmost cargo compartment. Still,\nperhaps there was no parachute there.\n\nHe squirmed around again, trying to get used to the nauseating\nsensation of free fall. He felt as if he had to exert conscious effort\nto keep his stomach from turning inside out. He felt an impulse to\nscream, to thrash his hands, and he had to remind himself that it was\nan illusion.\n\nFor a while he just rested, floating in the little space, bumping\nsteadily against one wall or another, with barely inches to spare. The\ntiny burning sunbeam pierced through again and vanished. Robin looked\nthrough the peephole.\n\nIt was the dead black of outer space now, a black beyond conception,\nblack with nothing in it to reflect. And against it an inconceivable\narray of brilliant points of light--the stars in numbers beyond any\nseen through the blanket of atmosphere. White, with some yellows and\nreds, and a few bluish ones here and there. The Earth moved again into\nsight and it was distinctly smaller--though still an impressively\nvast bowl--but beginning distinctly to resemble a monstrous globe\nin bas-relief, breathtakingly impressive with its living face, its\nshifting misty veil of air and water vapor.\n\nRobin became aware that he was thirsty. Yes, and hungry too. He took\nstock of his situation. He felt through his pockets, came up with one\nof the candy bars he had taken. He hefted it thoughtfully. Should he\neat it now or save it?\n\nThat raised the question he had been unconsciously avoiding. Save it\nfor what?\n\nIf he was indeed heading for the boundless regions of space, then he\nwas a doomed man. If he ate now, it would mean that starvation would\ncome sooner. If he delayed, doled it to himself in small bits, it could\nonly prolong the agony awhile, but would not the result still be the\nsame?\n\nThere was the chance, the odd chance, that the rocket somehow might yet\nreturn to Earth. It might describe a circle, an arc, finally begin to\nfall back. If it did so, the parachute would operate and perhaps land\nRobin in safety.\n\nSomehow it didn't seem likely to Robin, yet that chance existed. If so,\nit would have to return to Earth before a full starvation period could\nresult in death. Robin had read somewhere that one could go without\nfood for as much as thirty days, but without water for not more than\nseven or eight. If the rocket were describing an arc or a parabola,\nthen it would surely start its return within less than that week's\nleeway.\n\nWith this in mind, Robin unwrapped the candy bar and ate it. The second\none he would save as long as possible. But what about water?\n\nThe squeaking of the test animals broke in on his thoughts. Surely\nthey must have been supplied with some sort of food for their flight?\nRobin switched himself around to face the floor and began to dig at\nthe padding there. He managed to loosen it, pull it to one side,\nrevealing the floor of the compartment. As he had hoped, it was not\na metal plate. His own chamber, the one for the instruments, was not\na section in itself but only part of a section paneled off by braced\nplasterboard. And what was more there were already holes drilled\nthrough it so that the air in both sections would be equalized.\n\nThis answered another question Robin had been trying to avoid. How was\nit the air was remaining fresh now, though it had gone stale while he\nwas hiding? Apparently there was a small supply of oxygen operating\nautomatically in the animal section that seeped through into the upper\ncompartment too. Evidently once the rocket went into flight this\nstarted to work and would continue for the originally calculated period.\n\nRobin dug his fingers into the openings and pulled. Gradually the\nplasterboard bent away and opened a space into the section below. He\nlooked down, using his flashlight.\n\nThere were two cages below, well padded. In one, two little brown\nmonkeys clung together floating just above the floor and looking\nterrified. They chattered when they saw him, but remained tightly\nlocked in each other's arms. In the other, four small rabbits were\nplacidly nibbling bits of lettuce, although one rabbit was upside\ndown, another sideways on the side of the cage.\n\nThere were a couple of small boxes set in each cage, and Robin could\nsee that they dispensed food and water to the animals at presumably\nregular intervals. Robin reached down next to the monkeys' cage and\nstarted to work loose the small water holder there. He found it slid\nout of place once he turned the holding bolt. As he drew the little\nflask upward, one of the monkeys made an effort to nip his finger, but\nhe withdrew it in time.\n\nThe water flask drawn up into Robin's compartment made him feel better.\nThis would make his stay a little more comfortable for a while. He felt\nsorry for the monkeys, who might go thirsty now, but he had a suspicion\nthat the two little beasts were probably too hysterically frightened to\neat or drink anyway. Robin wet his throat a little.\n\nHe looked back down, reached out, and investigated the food\ncompartment. Sure enough, there were several bananas in the monkeys'\nfood container. They would do also.\n\nHe glanced around the space below again. There were the oxygen tanks,\nset up with a timer, one gently hissing away. There also was a small\nheating unit with a thermostat that evidently kept the temperature in\nthe animal division at a level--and almost certainly was doing the same\nfor the whole section.\n\nRobin grimaced to himself as he worked the padding back into place\non the floor. He might manage to be quite comfortable for a while\nlonger--a day or so more. While there's life, there's hope, he said to\nhimself. Better check the parachute question, too, while I'm at it.\n\nHe reversed himself in a neatly executed weightless somersault and\nmaking what had once been his roof the floor, worked the padding out\nthere. But here he was thwarted, for he found the rounded metal side of\nthe section's nose. If there were a parachute, it obviously occupied\nits own compartment at the very tip of the rocket's nose.\n\nHe looked out the peephole from his upside-down perch, stared musingly\nat the panoply of the stars. He wondered if he could recognize a\nplanet should one swing across his narrow field of vision, decided\nthat perhaps he might not be able to do so, so vast were the number of\nstars present. He looked again at Earth, noticing that it had visibly\nrotated on its axis. That meant that time had passed, a good deal of\nit. Mentally he tried to calculate just how much. He was looking at\nthe Eastern Hemisphere now, or a corner of it. At least half a day, or\nmaybe a day and a half, or more. How could he tell how long he had been\nasleep, how long unconscious?\n\nHe realized that he was tired, that his body still ached from the\npainful take-off. He closed his eyes, and without actually wanting to,\nfell asleep.\n\nHis sleeping body swung slowly to and fro in the tiny space, bumping\ngently from one side to the other. As he slept he dreamed of falling,\ndreamed of falling over huge endless cliffs, of dropping down strange\nchasms, of being carried by huge birds and suddenly being dropped.\n\nHis subconscious mind would never give up the insistent awareness\nthat his body was falling. It was a certain thing that such would\nbe the dreams of anyone in space flight. The built-in machinery of\nself-protection identifies a sense of loss of weight with the automatic\nwarning of a fall. Ten thousand thousand generations of climb from\nprimeval arboreal ancestry found the warning valid--no conscious\nknowledge otherwise would ever shut off this instinctive alarm.\n\nHe awoke again with a start and a convulsive grasp for a tree branch.\nBut he shook off the sensation and rubbed his eyes. He took another\nsip from the water flask, reached into the compartment below and took\none of the bananas. The monkeys were still in each other's arms, but\nnow asleep. The rabbits were nosing the corners of their cage as if\neverything were perfectly normal.\n\nHe looked through his peephole and saw the Moon.\n\nIt was large, it was vast, it took up most of the view in his range.\nIt looked as close as the Earth had looked before. He looked upon the\nstupendous moonscape with awe. It was the vision one strains to see\nthrough a telescope. He had often paid a dime to look at it through\nthe six-inch telescope at the City Science Museum. This was the same\nvision, but bigger and clearer, so very, very clear.\n\nHe could see only a small section of the Moon, but that was impressive.\nA particularly rugged area of jagged mountains, huge craters, high\nwalled and wide bottomed, with long rills and ridges running across the\nsurfaces.\n\nIt shone white under the sun, with immensely black shadows breaking\nit where the sun failed to penetrate. Yet there were more than whites\nand grays and blacks here. He saw that without the atmosphere of Earth\nthere were other more delicate shadings. The sides of some mountains\nhad bluish and greenish tinges, and more than one crater bottom showed\na distinct faint tinge of pale green, or in other spots yellowish\nblotches. And in one small spot he distinctly saw a mistiness of the\nsurface, saw that a faint fuzziness barred the clear sight of the\ncrater bottom.\n\nHe stared with wonder at the sight and the Moon slowly turned out of\nhis vision as the rocket turned. He looked away, deep in thought.\n\nHe had read enough about the Moon in his astronomical readings. He knew\nthe various theories, the latest conjectures. He knew that mistiness,\nthat evidences of clouding had been seen often by astronomers, but\nthe sight was nevertheless rare. No two astronomers ever happened\nto be looking at the same place at the same time. It was always one\nman's word, and it was never possible to predict such a thing, nor to\nphotograph it.\n\nHe knew that those men who made a special study of the Moon recognized\nthese things and had come to accept them as evidence that what was\nonce regarded as a dead world was not entirely dead. They had charted\nthese color shifts in certain spots, one or two areas could be\npredicted well enough to occasionally be provable to others. Pickering\nhad seen many such color changes, had even attributed it to some sort\nof fast-growing vegetation.\n\nRobin remembered that it was now largely believed that the Moon had not\nquite ceased its volcanic internal action. He recalled that astronomers\nhad begun to admit that the evidence of these bits of mist and the\nfurther evidence of actual mapped changes in the Lunar topography had\nproved that something was still warm and boiling within the crust of\nOld Luna.\n\nThen it occurred to Robin that if the Moon were that close to him, he\nmight really be falling upon it!\n\nHe peered out, saw again a section of Luna in view. It was close.\nEvidently the nose of the rocket had indeed been propelled far beyond\nEarth's atmosphere, beyond its gravitational grip. If the Moon had\nbeen elsewhere, perhaps the rocket nose would have swung about and\neventually returned to fall upon the Earth, as Robin had originally\nsurmised. But by chance his orbit, that of the rocket nose in free\nspace, had cut too close to the body of the Moon. The rocket was\ndangerously near to being seized in the grip of the Moon's gravity and\npulled down to it.\n\nRobin mulled this thought over and realized that it was possibly the\ntruth. He glued his eye to the peephole and tried to determine where he\nwas.\n\nAfter a while, he saw that the Moon was gradually increasing in size.\nThe rocket nose was definitely approaching the Lunar sphere. Because\nthe Earth no longer swung into view, Robin also realized that the\nrocket nose must have reversed itself, must be heading moonward, must\nbe falling to the Moon!\n\nIt would fall faster and faster now, as its trip through space was\nending. It was held in the grip of a new world and would speed to its\nfinal destruction like a meteoric bullet. It would be another meteor\nblasting into the surface to flash instantly into powder!\n\n\n\n\n_6. Target: Luna_\n\n\nNow that Robin recognized the certainty that he would never return,\nthat he was a doomed man, a curious sort of change came over him. Up\nto this time, he had been carefully suppressing his inner thoughts,\ncomforting himself with the hope that the trip would somehow end\nup safely. Yet while his mind was dwelling on that thought to the\nexclusion of others, his nerves had been under tension. He had felt\nhimself continually on the edge of breakdown, in proximity to screaming.\n\nBut Robin had been trained well. His life had never been a\nparticularly easy one and the crying had almost certainly got out of\nhis system during the days when as a little boy he had wandered through\na war-torn land hungry and homeless. Life in an orphanage, at best,\nlacks much of the careful comforts of parents' hands, and those who had\ncome out of such upbringing learn strong self-control early, learn to\nhold their jumping nerves in check at moments of tension and crisis.\n\nNow that the conscious realization that a crash into the Moon was\ninevitable had forced itself into acceptance, Robin felt a slipping\naway of this tension. The die had been cast, the doubt had been\nremoved. He actually felt an easing of his mind, felt himself able to\ntake cooler estimate of his situation.\n\nHe curled himself up in his narrow, closetlike space as comfortably as\npossible and thought the matter over. He was hungry again and still\nthirsty and this time he ate the second candy bar without saving any.\nAt the rate of speed he was traveling, it could not be many hours more\nbefore he flashed to a sudden, fiery, meteoric death. He turned that\nthought over in his mind, while he drank some more water.\n\nA meteoric end, he thought, to flash like a blazing firebolt, to crash\nwith the violence of an explosion against the dry, dusty surface of the\nMoon. It might have been spectacular to observe, but he would never\nknow. He wondered if it would be seen from the Earth.\n\nSuddenly, like an automatic switch being thrown on an electronic\nrelay, a memory shot into his thoughts. He was well-read in astronomy,\nparticularly on the subject of the Moon, and the thought that struck\nhim was this: _Astronomers did not see meteors crash into the Moon!_\nThey just didn't! And Moon observation under powerful telescopes\nwas most exact; if even fair-sized meteors hit the Moon with the\nsame explosive impact that they hit Earth, they would be seen beyond\nquestion. Further, since the Moon was a companion of the Earth, and our\nhome planet was bombarded with countless meteors daily, the Moon must\nbe a target of a like number. Of course, the meteors that hit Earth\nwere almost entirely burned up by atmospheric friction long before\nreaching the surface.\n\nBut the Moon apparently had no atmosphere ... there should have been\nnothing to prevent them from constantly battering the face of the Moon\nin a continuous, heavy rain of iron and rock. Lunar meteors should be\nvisible all the time. But they were not!\n\nSo ... what would really happen when his rocket hit the Moon?\n\nRobin was tingling with strange excitement. Facing death as he was,\nhe knew that even at the moment of dying he would be rewarded with\nat least one secret of the universe now unknown to men. What was the\nsecret? He wracked his brain trying to bring back to memory all that he\nhad read on that problem.\n\nAnd he brought back the memory that during the past few years a growing\nnumber of astronomers had begun to believe that the Moon was not\nentirely without an atmosphere. It wasn't believed to have much of one,\nbut it had been pointed out that most meteors to hit Earth burn up at\nleast thirty miles high. And the atmosphere at that height on Earth was\nvery, very thin. So thin indeed that if the Moon had a belt of air only\nthat dense, it might not be particularly detectable from Earth, might\nnot make much difference from the surface--it was almost a vacuum so\nfar as living matter would be concerned--but it would suffice to burn\nup meteors!\n\nSo it seemed likely that his rocket nose would be heated to\nincandescence by the tenuous Lunar atmosphere and burn to ash long\nbefore it touched the surface.... It wasn't a comforting thought--he\nrather preferred the original conception of crashing.\n\nRobin smiled grimly to himself. A dismal prospect, indeed. He had\nsomehow cherished the hope that at least some wreckage of his rocket\nwould be scattered about the surface, to be discovered some day by the\nexplorers of the future, perhaps hundreds of years later. They would\nspeculate upon it, perhaps trace it and in that way know that one Robin\nCarew had, in death, been the first to reach the Moon.\n\nBut to burn up on high, even that faint honor would be denied him!\n\nHe looked again through the peephole. The Moon was close now, very\nclose. He looked down upon a heaving and fearful view--a vast sea of\nglistening white, with streaks and patches of gray, and here and there\ngreat gaping clefts of black. Huge ringed craters, their saw-toothed\nmountain walls soaring into the sky--and craters upon craters, big ones\nand little ones, broken ones, craters breaking into the boundaries of\nothers, little ones dotting the bottom of big ones, cracks and clefts\nshooting from their bases; a ring of jagged mountains running across\nthe moonscape; areas of apparently flat plains.\n\nThe sun was directly overhead, for it was still full moon and the glare\nwas great, the shadows that mark the setting or rising of a Lunar day\nnot too obvious, stunted patches of jet blackness. But the Moon was\nnot entirely whites and grays, for indeed it was gently tinted in\nspots with other colorations. He could see for himself that there were\ngreenish tints in some flat spots, yellowish and purpling areas. And\nyes, there was even in one tiny patch in a crater floor a faint cloudy\nmass, a mere haziness that indicated some sort of gaseous mist.\n\nRobin drank in the scene, the view of another world, that world which\nhas dazzled the dreamers of Earth for thousands of years. These might\nbe his last moments, but he could not be denied the saturation of his\nsenses.\n\nThe rocket was fast heading down toward a point near the center.\nThe Moon was spreading out, filling the view, and the rocket's slow\nrotation no longer brought anything into view but moonscape, a constant\nshifting view, with wonders upon wonders moving into his eye's scope.\n\nRobin drew back a moment, rubbed his arms, scratched his legs. He felt\nhimself tingling, wondered if it were his nerves. He felt itchy, hoped\nhis nerves would not give way. He thought to himself, I may have only\nminutes now. I shall watch till the end. Then he heard a faint, faint\nnoise.\n\nFrom somewhere there was a humming. The merest shadow of a hum,\nand Robin listened to it, startled. The humming rose in pitch, it\nwas no dream, and as he sat, mouth open, amazed, there was a thin,\nhigh-pitched screaming outside the rocket and he suddenly began to feel\nhot.\n\nRobin had but a second in which to think to himself, There's an\natmosphere and we're burning up, when there came a new sound. A sort of\n_bloop_ from over his head, a snapping noise, and something seemed to\ngrab the rocket and jerk it upside down violently.\n\nRobin was tossed in a sharp somersault, banging against the original\nfloor of his compartment in a jumble of arms and legs. He sat up and\nrealized that he was sitting--not floating--but actually sitting\n_against gravity's pull_! He scrambled onto his knees, peeped through\nhis peephole.\n\nThe sky was back in view, the Moon was below the falling ship and he\ncould see the edge of a huge, circular orange mass above him, straining\nand pulling. It was the parachute from the nose of the rocket. It was\nthe orange parachute designed to land the instrument nose and the test\nanimals safely in the New Mexico desert. And it had been set to open\nautomatically upon the pressure of air when falling.\n\nThere was an atmosphere around the Moon then ... a thin, thin one,\nbut the delicate detonator of the chute had functioned. The great\nhemispheric mass of delicate nylon had opened, had found a purchase,\nand was dragging the rocket back from a disastrous burn-out.\n\nRobin breathed a sigh of relief, strained his eyes to see the moonscape\nagain. The rocket was still falling, mighty fast it seemed. He could\nsee the moonscape rise out, expand to fill the view. The rocket was\nwarm now, definitely still heating from the thin friction. It vibrated\nand whistled but it swung in no breeze. It was moving too fast. In that\nalmost unnoticeable belt of tenuous air there would be no winds that\ncould deflect it. The parachute was open, but the air was not thick\nenough to do more than slow it down too gradually for it to be saved.\n\nIt would, he realized, still crash into the surface with a deadly\nforce. It would hit like a shell from a cannon, and the explorers of\nthe far future would have their mysterious fragments of tooled metal to\nspeculate on.\n\nBelow him Robin saw the jagged mountain peaks reaching up for him\ninto the dark black sky. He scanned it, remembering his Moon books,\nremembering the cold photos taken by distant Terrestrial cameras and\nthe careful diagrams and names given by men long dead. He was hitting\nnear the center of the Moon, a little above it, and the crater whose\nwalls were reaching up ... why he could even name it. He grinned wryly.\nIt would be Theophilus, and it seemed he would miss it, hit somewhere\nnear it in a bay of the so-called Sea of Tranquillity.\n\nRushing up toward him, Theophilus was no peaceful Greek ancient. It\nwas a barren, toothed, rocky edge, miles up, without the snow that\nmakes our mountains majestic, without a trace of the forests that\nconceal a mountain's jagged sides, without even the gentle weathering\nof rain and water.\n\nAnd the Sea of Tranquillity--a dark, wrinkled plain that looked as if\nit had gone through the agonies of torture ages past. The marks of\nalmost-vanished volcanoes on it, pale circular rings like pocks of\nburst bubbles, rambling ridges, and ugly cracks, and here and there\ndomes rising gray out of the surface, like the tops of giant bubbles\nworking their way out of the dry and flaky crust.\n\nRobin watched in dread fascination. He heard the whistling and\nshrieking of the rocket like a demon in torment. He himself was burning\nand itching as he was being baked, although he felt no fever. The\nrocket was warm but getting no warmer. The topmost peak of Theophilus\nwas rushing up into his sky like a fast-growing stone geyser.\n\nHe watched it shoot up, saw it grow, saw the ground become clearer and\nclearer, each ghastly detail spreading out, assuming three-dimension\nreality. Now the peak was on a level with his eyes, now it was beyond\nhim, and he was in the last few seconds of his fall.\n\nThe rocket seemed to be slowing slightly. The atmosphere was possibly\ngetting a trifle thicker at the surface, enough to prolong the agony\na minute or two or three longer. Above him the parachute strained and\ntwisted. But still the rocket was falling too fast. It rushed down,\nstraining to complete its act of affinity with a new gravity, as if\ntired of its brief period of interplanetary freedom, and anxious to\npledge allegiance to a new gravitational master.\n\nBelow, the moonscape was coming up fast. Robin could see well enough to\nbegin to speculate where exactly he would hit. There was a small circle\nthat must have been a crater scar. There were several dark lines that\nmight be a network of cracks. And there was a dome.\n\nHe remembered those domes. They had been quite a recent discovery too.\nNot easily seen until latter-day instruments showed the surface of the\nMoon dotted with these odd bumps. Their nature was still a mystery.\n\nIt looked as if Robin would find out the hard way what their\nconstruction was. For now he was clearly heading directly for the\ncenter of the one below him. A bubble-top pushing out from the plain,\nhard and shiny like lava, glistening in the sun against the gray and\ndusty surface of the plain around it.\n\nTheophilus's wall was already on the horizon, high and towering. And\nnow Robin realized how terribly fast the rocket was still falling. The\nmountain was a measuring stick and it was fearful.\n\nThere was a moment of dreadful suspense as the rocket raced to a bull's\neye on the upthrust center of the dome. The rounded surface rushed up.\n\nRobin flattened himself against the padding, clutched his head in his\nhands, and stiffened himself. The rocket hummed against the thin air,\nit vibrated against the parachute, there was a terrible split second of\nshock when the bullet-shaped structure of the rocket's cargo nose made\nits contact with its Lunar target, and then a clap of sound in Robin's\near like a blockbuster going off.\n\n\n\n\n_7. The Honeycomb Place_\n\n\nRobin had no time to wonder why he had not been instantly killed by the\ncrash, because the explosion on hitting the surface of the dome was\nfollowed instantly by a tremendous roaring sound that surrounded the\nentire rocket nose. This was in turn accompanied by a powerful pressure\non the rocket, which threw Robin against the nose-end cushioning and\nheld him there.\n\nThe pressure was not steady, changing as the roaring itself changed,\nwith sudden bursts of sound, convulsive shoves, and changes in pitch.\nThe rocket was being slowed by a terrific outward burst of gases,\ngases that must have been imprisoned in a huge volcanic bubble whose\noutermost surface was the dome, so mysterious to Terrestrial observers.\nBy bursting through the thin lava shell, Robin's rocket had released\nthese pent-up gases and was boring its way down on its still rapid\nmomentum against the pressure of this column of gas.\n\nRobin did not know this at the time, though he figured it out later. At\nthe time, he had all he could do to keep himself from being battered\nblack-and-blue by the jolting rocket. He kept his head clutched tightly\nin his arms, rode with the bumps and roars, and tried to keep his\nbreath from being knocked out of his lungs.\n\nThere was another violent shock and crack and again the rocket bounced\nto a new flow of gases. It had slammed through one huge bubble,\nbreaking through the bottom shell only to burst into a lower pocket\nof gas. The roaring subsided to a lower pitch as the new gases did\nnot find the near-vacuum of the surface that the first gas bubble had\nopened upon. The rocket fell steadily, bursting through a third, and\nthen a fourth such bubble. It was clear that the surface of the Moon,\nat least in that area, was a mass of congealed gas pockets, a honeycomb\nof thin-walled lava bubbles, perhaps quite deep.\n\nThe rocket was almost entirely devoid of its original space momentum\nby the time it hit the bottom of the last bubble, snapped the thin\ncrust, and fell through it. This time there was a sudden hissing around\nthe battered nose and a warmth began to flow through the body of the\nrocket. It was enveloped in a belt of hot steam through which it fell\nseveral hundred feet and then hit something with a loud splashing\nnoise. The sound vanished as the rocket sank deep into the new\nsubstance, came to a halt, and bobbed back upward.\n\nRobin had gotten hold of himself after the third bubble and was hanging\non, mentally trying to estimate what had happened. This last sound had\nbeen familiar. It must have been water, and the bobbing back of the\nrocket to the surface confirmed his views. He felt the rocket bounce a\ncouple of times and then subside to a gentle rocking and rolling.\n\nRobin held on for a moment, getting his balance. In some ways the\nnew motion was more disturbing than all that had gone before--the\ncylindrical body of the rocket, with its blunt end and its rounded\nnose, was twisting and turning as only can be done by a bottle tossed\nin a flowing stream. Robin tried to get hold of himself, orient himself\nto the odd seasick motion, then managed to work his way to the peephole.\n\nHe could see nothing. Whatever was outside was without light. But it\nsounded like water lapping against the sides, it felt like water's\nforces, and the rocket seemed definitely to be afloat. Robin used his\nflashlight, tried to direct its beam through the tiny camera outlet.\nAfter a little manipulation he succeeded in getting some reflection\nfrom outside.\n\nIt was water, and the rocket seemed to be floating rapidly along\non some sort of dark subterraneous tide. Robin sat back, puzzled.\nWater--under the Moon?\n\nHe held on, still feeling a little dizzy, feeling dirty and itchy, but\nsuddenly beneath it all a little thrilled and pleased. He had survived\nthe crash by some miracle--he was on the Moon and alive! What next?\n\nNext was quick to come. There was a sudden dip in the current and\nthe rocket tilted forward as it shot down a spillway, down a violent\ndecline on a raging torrent, sliding down an unseen waterfall for a\nsurprisingly long time, leveling out at a fast clip, sliding down new\ntunnels through which the water raced, hitting the side of sharp turns\nwith occasional glancing blows, down more dips and falls, spinning\nviolently around in unseen whirlpools, and finally racing out on a fast\nstream to gradually slow down and finally come to rest, gently bobbing.\n\nRobin had been knocked around during this breathless ride and only\ngradually did he realize it was over. Warily he raised his head from\nwhere he was sprawled in his tiny closet-compartment and waited. But\nthe gentle bobbing continued.\n\nHe put his eye to the peephole and looked. There was a glow outside, a\ngrayish, pale glow, but he could see that the nose of the rocket was\nsomehow grounded on something dry while the tail was still in the water\nrocking to the current.\n\nHe considered his next course of action for a few seconds. It seemed as\nif he had a chance to escape from his vehicle at last. But escape to\nwhat?\n\nWas there air outside, wherever it was that he found himself? If there\nwere air, was it enough to sustain him? Might it not be poisonous or\nutterly lacking in oxygen?\n\nWell, Robin thought to himself, there isn't really any choice. If I\nstay here, I'll starve to death or suffocate. If I go out, I may die\neven sooner. But now or later, if it has to be, it won't make any\ndifference. Whatever the odds in favor of my being able to breathe\nhere, I've got to take them.\n\nHe twisted around, found the circular port through which he had\noriginally entered the rocket. He worked at it with his fingers,\nrealizing that it might be quite difficult to open. He worked away\nthe padding that lined the interior, found that it had an arrangement\nthat had automatically sealed it when closed. There was no handle on\nthe inside, for it had never been planned to be opened from that side.\nHowever, there were several screws over a small plate, and Robin set to\nwork to unscrew them. He had a Boy Scout knife in his pants pocket--the\nkind with several blades--and with the back of the biggest blade he\nworked out the screws.\n\nThe panel off, he saw how the sealed gimbals worked, clicked them open\nand pushed open the door. It held tight for a moment, then popped open.\nThere was a sudden drop in the pressure, Robin's ears popped, and he\ngasped for breath.\n\nThe air outside was lower in pressure than that inside the cargo nose\nof the rocket, which had been sealed at Earth level. But it was air and\nit was breathable. Robin drew in several deep lungfuls, savoring it.\n\nIt was oddly exhilarating, as if highly charged with oxygen. At the\nsame time there was a smell of mold and dampness and a definite taste\nof sulfur and phosphorus like that just after a kitchen match has been\nlighted. Even so, the air was breathable.\n\nRobin worked his head and shoulders through the narrow opening, slid\nforward and landed on hands and knees on the rocky surface. He got to\nhis feet, looked around.\n\nHe was standing on the bank of a rushing stream of water, which was\npouring out of a large gap in the side of a cliff. The cliff ran\nstraight up, gently curving to form part of the ceiling several\nhundred feet overhead. The extent of this ceiling was impossible to\ndetermine--it was dark and obscure--but it seemed to Robin almost at\nonce that he was in some sort of gigantic enclosed space--a vast cavern\nbeneath the surface of the Moon, probably several miles beneath it.\n\nThe water coming from the underground falls rushed out to form a wide,\nshallow river which flowed along one side of the cavern and widened out\nto a few hundred feet clear across to the farther wall. On Robin's side\nthe floor of the cavern rose in a slow slope until it reached its wall\nperhaps three hundred feet away. Robin could not estimate the length\nof the cavern. Looking along the river bank, the cave seemed to become\nveiled in a general mistiness and gathering darkness.\n\nThe light itself came from no definite source, but seemed to emanate\nfrom the rocky walls and ceiling, from the clayey ground, and from\nthe general atmosphere. Robin supposed that the source was a natural\nphosphorescence which he knew was not too uncommon even in Terrestrial\ncaverns.\n\nAll around on the soil bordering the flowing water was a forest, a\nforest with the weirdest vegetation Robin had ever seen. Plants growing\nin clumps and clusters, plants whose large treelike stalks resembled\na whitish-blue bamboo, and which burst into globular blue bulbs which\nseemed to serve as leaves. Among these tree-sized growths was a rich\nundergrowth of tight balls of varying yellow and green and purple,\ngrowing like thick, squat mushrooms. And everywhere else a thick, lush\ncarpet of green, not grasslike but rather like some oversize moss.\n\nIn this forest there were no sounds of birds or animals, but only that\nof plants swaying in the river breeze, the rushing of the waters, and\nfrom somewhere distant in the unseen end of the cavern a strange,\nsteady hissing sound.\n\nThe rocket, or what was left of it, lay wedged against a section of the\nbank, its nose up and its tail swaying in the current. Robin looked at\nit, amazed to find it so small. All that was left of the rocket was\nthe cargo nose, which was the only part sent off after the last of the\nrocket sections had discharged their forces and been dropped off. The\nwhole affair was not more than about ten feet long, from the battered,\nblunted red nose, from which several long, straggling orange cords\nhung--all that was left of the parachute and its attachments--down\nto the scraped and battered white cylinder that was the cargo\ncompartment. The compartment ended in a flat plate which bore only a\nfew wires that had once connected it with the break-away mechanism\nof the last of the atomic blasting chambers. This alone was the load\nof the eight-story tower of energy which had been the Red Sands\nexperimental rocket.\n\nRobin, without further delay, bent down to the cylinder and began\nto haul and push it entirely out of the water to the dry ground. He\nknew he could not afford to risk its loss. To his surprise, moving\nthe rocket head was an easy task. It was extremely light and he found\nhimself possessed of tremendous strength, tired and bruised and sore as\nhe was.\n\nIt was, he thought, as he pulled the rocket along, the Moon and its\nweak gravity. He would only weigh a sixth of his Earth weight here, so\nwould the cargo head, yet he would have the muscles necessary for much\nmore than that weight. He would literally be a superman here--if he\ncould survive.\n\nSurvival, he knew, would be the question. He didn't know whether even\nnow he might be inhaling poison from the strange, thin sublunar air. He\ndidn't know what mysterious radioactive rays might be bathing him with\ntheir baleful influence. He didn't know whether any of the vegetation\nin this cavern world would be edible.\n\nHaving brought the cargo cylinder to a safe spot many feet from\nthe water, Robin looked for the door that would open the animal\ncompartment. He found it, forced it open. Inside were the two cages.\nGently he reached in, unscrewed them from their holdings, and lifted\nthem out.\n\nOne of the monkeys was dead, probably killed by some of the jouncing\nthe rocket had taken. The other, looking miserable, was clinging to the\nbars chattering. Robin looked at it, and the monkey looked back. The\nyoung man unlatched the cage, reached in, and took the little brown\nanimal by the back of the neck. But the monkey made no effort to bite.\nInstead, it twisted around, grabbed Robin's arm, and hung tight.\n\nWhen his grip was released, the monkey scurried up Robin's arm and\nclung to his shoulder, recognizing the need for companionship after its\nfrightening experiences.\n\nThe rabbits had fared slightly better. One of them was dead, but the\nother three, while somewhat beaten around, were alive and sniffling\ntheir pink noses. Robin saw that there was very little food or water\nleft for the animals.\n\nHere then was the means to test the Moon's capacity to produce food\nand drink. First, however, Robin decided he would build a pen for the\nrabbits. If he were lucky, he could breed them and have at least one\nsource of food suited to his system.\n\nHe went over to the nearest clump of ball-trees, looked them over,\ntested his strength on them. They broke easily and quickly when\nhe grasped one by the trunk and pulled. He found that it could be\nsplintered into shreds fairly rapidly and that inside the shell of the\nstalk was a mass of cottony matter.\n\nHe shredded a number of the stalks, and then staked them out in the\nground to make a small fenced pen, tying the whole together with one\nof the long cords hanging from the parachute nose. Into this makeshift\npen, he released the three rabbits. He filled the cup from their cage\nwith water from the river, placed it in the pen. The rabbits hopped\nover, sniffed, and drank. They seemed to suffer no ill effects.\n\nRobin broke open one of the ball-like growths from the tree, found it\ncontained a substance resembling a combination of melon and potato. He\noffered some of this to the rabbits and after an interval they ate it\nand seemed to like it.\n\nThe monkey was chattering away as Robin did this and suddenly scampered\ndown and snatched a piece of the ball-food, stuffing it into its mouth.\nRobin had not wanted to use the little creature for a test but the\ndamage was done. However, the monkey seemed to enjoy it.\n\nRobin sat down on the ground and watched. He felt tired, now realized\njust how tired he was, how sorely he ached from his experience. He\nfelt warm and headachy now that the strain was over. He knew he still\nhad things to do. He wanted to try to make a fire and cook the rabbit\nthat had been killed. He was thirsty as well. He wanted to tie a cord\nto the monkey so that the animal would not run away into the unknown\nand possibly dangerous regions of the cavern. He wanted to find a safe\nplace to sleep and hide should there be some sort of animal life around.\n\nBut he was growing terribly sleepy and feeling quite sick. He curled\nup, and before he could stop himself, he was asleep.\n\nThe rabbits nibbled on. The monkey sat on a ball in one of the strange\ntrees and watched in silence. Far off, somewhere in the cavern, the\nmysterious hissing continued.\n\n\n\n\n_8. Robinson Crusoe Carew_\n\n\nWhen Robin Carew opened his eyes, he knew he was a very sick man.\nHe felt warm, sticky, and he hurt all over. He tried to sit up, but\neverything spun dizzily around him. His arms, legs, and body were\nburning intolerably and there was an itch throughout him that he could\ndo nothing about. He lay back, trying to gain strength.\n\nA little later he managed to crawl to the water's edge, fill the\ncontainer he had used in the trip from Earth, drag himself back. For a\nperiod whose length he could not determine he lay helpless in fever\nand pain, arousing himself only long enough to drink to soothe his\ntortured body.\n\nFinally, the fever broke. He sat up, feeling weak but with his mind\nclear at long last. He dragged himself to his feet, blessing the light\ngravity, aware that if he were back home his body would not have\nresponded. He felt that he was gaunt, he knew he had been through a\nterrible siege, and he could only guess at the time he had lain there,\ntossing about on the strange Lunar ground, unprotected in the queer\nclimate of this unknown cavern. It must, he felt, have been days--Earth\ndays, of course--that his attack had lasted.\n\nLater on he decided that he had suffered from a severe case of space\nburn. Having traveled through the emptiness of the void between the\nplanets, the vessel had been nearly unprotected from the cosmic rays\nand the more penetrating of the sun's invisible rays. He considered\nhimself lucky to have survived at all.\n\nHe desperately needed food now to rebuild his body. He looked at the\nrabbit pen. The little animals were there and evidently prospering on\nthe ball-food he had prepared for them before his sickness. It was\nalmost all gone and he broke open and pared more at once. He wondered\nhow long it would be before the animals bred--he knew that rabbits bred\nfast and abundantly, and hoped it would hold true on the Moon.\n\nThere was a sudden chattering in one of the strange trees and he looked\nup to see a little brown face peering at him. In a moment, the monkey\nleaped to the ground, then leaped in one tremendous jump to Robin's\nshoulder and perched there happy at finding companionship again. The\nmonkey looked none the worse for its experience and evidently was\ngetting along nicely on the Lunar vegetation. Thus encouraged, Robin\nfed himself, first carefully testing everything on the monkey, who\nobjected to nothing.\n\nBut somehow the food was not entirely satisfying to the man, who felt\nthat he needed more than that to recover his full energy. He looked\nagain at the rabbits, looked also for the carcass of the dead one.\nBut he found that part of it had rotted and part had been consumed.\nHe looked closely and saw his first glimpse of a Lunar counterpart to\nanimal life.\n\nThere were many tiny creatures, a half inch to an inch in length,\nlooking at first like ants but on closer inspection appearing more like\nthree-segmented worms, for they lacked legs and moved in an inchworm's\nfashion. Instead of antennae, each little worm-ant had on its front\nsegment a single upstanding stalk ending in a little yellow ball. Robin\ntouched one of these and it glowed momentarily. An organ of light, he\nthought, something like the ones carried by deep-sea fishes. The tiny\nthings were eating the dead rabbit.\n\nRobbin went back and examined the three remaining rabbits. Two were\nmales and the female was evidently heavy with young. Well, he could\nafford to dispense with one of the males, then, for he knew his body\nneeded meat.\n\nHe put the rabbit back though, realizing that first he must make a\nfire and determine how to cook his meal. He searched his pockets. He\nwas wearing the GI jacket he'd taken from the soldier in Las Cruces. As\nhe had hoped, he dug up a pack of matches in one pocket. He turned it\nover in thought. When this pack was used up, how could he make fire?\n\nHe piled some trunks of dead tree stalks in a cleared spot; he lit\nthem with one of his matches. They caught fire rapidly and soon he had\na nice blaze going. He watched the smoke rise and saw that it drifted\nrapidly away in the same direction the current was flowing--evidence of\nmore caverns somewhere beyond.\n\nHe opened his scout knife, hesitated. He'd never cooked a rabbit\nbefore. In fact, he'd never had occasion to cook anything for himself.\nIt was meat, he thought, and even if it were eaten raw--well, savages\ndid, so he, too, could manage. He thought about boiling it in water,\nthen realized that the light air pressure might allow water to boil\nwithout getting the necessary cooking effects. The best method\ntherefore was to fry it where he could observe the progress.\n\nSteeling himself, he seized the rabbit, killed and skinned it, the\nlatter a process which he found thoroughly unpleasant. Cleaning it of\nits entrails, another unpleasant task, he cut the meat up into sizable\nchunks, skewered a couple of pieces on a metal rod which had been part\nof one of the cages from the rocket, and sat down to cook it over the\nopen fire.\n\nIt turned out to be a longer job than he'd thought, and he burned the\nmeat quite thoroughly in the process, but finally he made it edible\nand chewed it slowly. He needed salt, he realized, and wondered if he\ncould find any. This would have priority when he began his explorations.\n\nHe hung the balance of the meat on a ball-tree with a piece of cord. He\nhad seen no evidence of flying insects or creatures, and hoped thereby\nto be able to preserve the rest of the meat.\n\nThus fed, he sat down and began to map out his course. I must do things\nsystematically, he told himself. I must keep track of time, set up a\nregular pattern of living, find a permanent base of operations. I shall\nhave to explore this cavern and those beyond it, find all possible\nenemies and invent ways and means of defending myself. I shall have to\nbreed my rabbits in quantity, find a way of using their pelts and fur.\nI shall have to determine a use for everything left from the rocket's\nmaterial--metals and the like.\n\nFor, he continued telling himself, my one aim shall be to stay alive\nlong enough to be found some day by exploring rockets from Earth. I\nam a Robinson Crusoe of a new world. Crusoe waited twenty-eight years\nfor rescue, I must be as courageous. In his case, he had no evidence\nthat any ship would ever bother to call on him. In my case I know that\nrockets are being made that will eventually lead to further Moon trips.\nI know that men are planning to come here. I must wait it out, even for\ntwenty-eight years.\n\nBut it was not that simple and he knew it. But first things first, and\nthe first task was to survive.\n\nWith the monkey scampering on ahead, he set out to walk to the\ncavern wall. He found it to be dark and glistening, a lavalike sheet\nresembling the bubble it was. Leaning against it and looking upward,\nhe saw that it curved gradually up, and that indeed he was in a flaw\nwithin a very porous world. Like the inside of a Clark candy bar, he\nthought, with a wry smile.\n\nAstronomers on Earth had always been puzzled by the lightness of the\nMoon. They had speculated on it as being mainly pumice. Lately there\nhad been much speculation and opinion holding forth the theory that the\nMoon was porous, had these bubbles and air pockets all through it, that\nthe Moon's water and atmosphere had all gone underground to be sealed\noff in these hollow spaces. He now knew they were right.\n\nMost of these Moon bubbles, large enough to hold cities, must be\nentirely sealed off. But others were linked, sometimes broken into by\nquakes or the volcanic action which was still going on in the depths of\nwhat had once been considered a dead world. This particular cavern was\nsuch a bubble.\n\nRobin walked along the outer wall and saw a dark black spot in it, and\nthen others. He came to them, found they were breaks in the surface,\npocks caused by smaller bubbles. He looked into one that opened at the\nbase. Using his flashlight, he could see that it was a small, almost\nentirely spherical cave. He found others pocking the walls of the\ncavern bubble.\n\nThis then was the ideal spot for a permanent home. Not that he needed\nshielding from the elements, for obviously there were no elements\nhere--no rain, snow, clouds, or weather oddities. Neither was there\nnight or day.\n\nRobin would move his possessions into this cave, simply to have them\nlocated and safe. Besides, there might be some larger form of life,\nsome carnivores around--he could not tell. Better to be safe than\nsorry, he said to himself.\n\nHe acted at once, carrying the rocket nose and its stuff to the cave,\ntransferring his rabbits and their pen to a spot just outside the cave\ndoor. He would need a bowl for water and, using his screwdriver blade,\nhe finally managed to detach the curved rocket nose and found himself\nin possession of a deep bowl. He took this down to the water, filled it\nand carried it back to his cave.\n\nAlready he began to feel cheerier. Nothing like work, he thought, to\ntake your mind off your other problems. Suddenly he realized he was\ntired.\n\nHow long had he been at this? He did not know. Now he realized that\nwith no sunrise or sunset visible in his underground world, he could\nnot tell time. He looked at his wrist watch, but it had stopped\nrunning, of course. He decided to take a nap; he lay down and fell\nasleep.\n\nWhen he woke up, he set his watch at eight o'clock, decided to consider\nthis the beginning of a day. He found the notebook he'd carried in his\nback pocket, opened it, and set up his new calendar. Using the date of\nthe rocket's take-off, he allowed five days as a probable estimate of\nthe time passed since. He had no means of knowing how long he had been\nill, he suspected it had been longer, but decided to let it stand.\nAfter arriving at the date, he made the time eight in the morning, laid\nout the times he expected to eat, to work, to sleep. He would try to\nlive according to a full Terrestrial day, checking the passage of time\nby his watch.\n\nHe then listed all the things he expected would have to be done, and\ndecided to check them off as he completed them. Next he ate breakfast\nfrom the fruit of the ball-tree. He spent the rest of that morning\ntrying to find a means of making fire. He had some bits of steel from\nthe rocket, and he tried to strike sparks on everything that resembled\nrock. After a search, he found some fragments of rock near the water\nthat gave off a spark. Whether these were flints or not, he did not\ncare, so long as they worked for him.\n\nWith this discovery he knew he would be free from worry about the\nproblem of matches. His next problem was to secure a weapon. This\nsolved itself rather fast with a bow and arrow. A long, flexible metal\ntube from the rear connections of the rocket, bent to make a bow when\ntied with a string of nylon cord, made a satisfactory _twang_ when\npulled. He made arrows out of the fibers of the Moontree stalks, and\npracticed shooting.\n\nThe next few days followed the same pattern. Robin enlarged his area\nof exploration, finding several other kinds of Lunar vegetation and a\nnumber of other insect-worms. He found several that were quite large,\none as large as a squirrel. It was an odd thing, humping itself along\nin little bounds--a creature of a dozen ball-like segments, two of\nwhich had toothed mouths, although only the ball in front had an eye,\na lidless orb set in the center of this ball. But the creature was\nfringed with the light-rod organs as the tiny worm-ants had been.\n\nRobin tried to cook part of this creature but the monkey refused to\ntouch it and he found it entirely unpalatable. On the other hand, he\nfound that when he removed the little yellow balls from the top of the\nlight stalks on the creature, they remained glowing--even as do the\nabdomens of fireflies. He therefore diligently set about catching a\nnumber of these Moonrats, as he named them, and making a lantern for\nhimself by filling a glass tube with the glow organs. This worked out\nquite nicely when he experimented in his dark cave-home, emitting a\nclear, though pale, yellow light.\n\nHis rabbit had a nice litter at last, and Robin carefully saw that they\nwere kept well supplied with food and drink. He would eat no more meat\nuntil there were several dozen adults, all breeding. But he felt that\nnow he was assured of a source of clothing when his own would give out.\nHe knew that eventually he would have to dress himself entirely in the\nproducts of his own ingenuity. His Earth clothes could last no more\nthan a few years. He had already devised for himself an experimental\npair of sandals from the rinds of the ball-tree fruit and the stalks of\nthe Moontrees. They would do, and he carefully removed his shoes and\nput them away. When he had heavy exploring to do, or if and when he\nmight try to reach the surface, he would need his good heavy leather\nshoes. Until then, the makeshift sandals would do.\n\nFor he knew that someday he would have to reach the surface. If and\nwhen the first astronauts arrived, they would not go below. They would\nprobably never suspect the presence of these unseen areas beneath\nthe crust, possibly not for many dozens of years. It would be on the\nsurface that Robin would have to go to find rescue. That was the\ngreatest problem he would have to solve. Against that terrible trip, he\nwould have to conserve and plan.\n\nMeanwhile, he had a toehold on life here, if conditions within his\nsublunar cavern did not change. But they were changing ... and not for\nthe better.\n\n\n\n\n_9. From Stone Age to Iron Age_\n\n\nWhen he woke up one morning Robin was vaguely aware of something\ndifferent. He opened his eyes to the dark interior of his cave-home and\nlay there on his bed of padding from the cargo chamber. For a while he\nrested quietly in that pleasant half-sleep of awakening after a good\nrest. Unconsciously his hand moved down searching for a blanket, but of\ncourse there was none. He'd never needed one before.\n\nHe unconsciously groped again for the blanket, then opened his eyes\nwide and sat up. There was a slight chill in the air at that! Now he\nnoticed the monkey, asleep, curled up tightly against his leg. That was\nodd because previously the little fellow had slept outside. What had\nbrought him in?\n\nRobin got up and Cheeky, as Robin had named his friend, woke up\ninstantly and leaped to his shoulder. \"What's the trouble, fellow?\"\nasked Robin, patting him on the head. Then the young man left the\ncave and looked around. At first nothing seemed greatly changed. The\ntemperature had dropped a few degrees, no doubt about it. Yet there was\nno special draft, no break in the bubble walls to account for it.\n\nHe looked at the plants and then realized that some of them were\nbeginning to change color. A grayness was creeping in subtly. The balls\nof Moontree fruit, which had been his chief sustenance, were showing\nsigns of wrinkling and had either already shriveled or were beginning\nto.\n\nRobin glanced around sharply, looked into his notebook calendar. He\ncalculated the days that had passed. When his rocket had crashed\nthe Moon had been full. This meant it was high noon of a Lunar day\non the surface above. But a Lunar day lasted about a Terrestrial\nmonth--twenty-eight days to be exact. When the sun was at its height,\nthe temperature of the surface crust was to be measured as high as 240\ndegrees Fahrenheit. By sunset it might be down to 160 degrees, but\nimmediately after sunset it would drop with great speed and shortly\nbegin to go as low as a hundred below zero and continue to drop for yet\nanother hundred degrees.\n\nAnd Robin had perhaps been in his sublunar cavern for ten or maybe\ntwelve days. The sun had set above, the Lunar night was there.\nThough the cavern was insulated by the best sort of insulation in\nthe universe--a honeycomb of several miles between the surface and\nitself--a honeycomb in many cases consisting of sealed bubbles, some\nnear vacuums--there was bound to be a gradual loss of the stored-up\nheat from the long Lunar day. It might take a while for this to become\nnoticeable, especially in view of the obviously warm volcanic action\nfrom the unseen areas near the core of the Moon below, yet there it was.\n\nSo now Robin knew that the Lunar day did have a counterpart here, that\nthere would be monthly seasons in his cavern and that he was facing a\nwinter that might last ten days more.\n\nHe looked around, pondering this. Could he survive? He had probably\nonly a short time to work this out. Obviously he had to work fast and\nmake good.\n\n\"Come, Cheeky,\" he said, \"no time for foolishness. No daily swim in the\nriver this morning. Harvest time is here.\"\n\nHe glanced at his rabbits, but they did not seem to mind the\ntemperature drop. He went into the clumps of Moontrees and began to\ngather their fruit--the big balls--as fast as possible. They were still\nplump enough to hold food-pulp. He realized that if he waited, they\nwould probably dry up on their trees, shrivel to seed as the increasing\ncold drew the moisture from them. He spent that day in gathering a\nharvest, in piling great masses of the fruit in a small cavern-wall\nbubble near his sleeping chamber. When he had amassed enough to see him\nthrough at least two weeks, he gathered the fallen trunks and dried-up\nold stalks and piled them in the narrow entrance to this storage cave.\nHe built a fire there, paced it out, and spread it out to burn slowly.\nHe would have to keep this fire going and another like it in front of\nhis own sleeping cavern.\n\nHe transferred the rabbits to his bubble-home also, rebuilding their\npen.\n\nAs he had expected, the temperature in his hidden world continued\nits fall. A few days later it was quite chilly and the Moontrees had\nacted as he surmised. Their fruits had withered quite rapidly, finally\ndropping off as small hard seeds. The tree stalks dried out, turned\nhard, and fell. Robin gathered them as fuel for his fires, found that\nthey were quite excellent, and also that the fresh-fallen ones could be\nwoven into basketry.\n\nThe river continued to flow, but was more sluggish, and its waters\nbegan to grow cold. On the other hand, the Moonworms and other little\ncreatures seemed to be having their heyday. They were out in quantities\ngreater than he had ever seen and were busily gathering the fallen\nseeds, carrying them away, evidently preferring them to the fruit.\n\nRobin made himself a jacket from an extra part of the padding,\nstitching it together with cord and thongs made from shell fibers. With\na fire going at the door of his cave, he found he still wouldn't need\nblankets.\n\nDuring the balance of the Lunar night Robin was forced to remain close\nto his caves, tending his fires, conserving all his energies. Outside,\nthe temperature never actually reached freezing, or at least not that\nRobin could estimate. But at its worst, it was definitely chilly and\nthe river fairly cold.\n\nThe view within the cavern cleared somewhat of its usual mugginess\nand he could see much more. He could now make out the walls on all\nsides, and discovered that the farthest distance, in the direction in\nwhich the river ran, was perhaps several miles off. The vegetation had\nmainly flattened, was drying up, and he could see everywhere the little\nball-segmented insects humping and squirming about.\n\nHe saw a number of varieties he had not noticed before. One day\nventuring out with his bow and arrow, he disturbed something working\namid a pile of broken stalks. The thing rushed out, directly at him. It\nwas large, as large as a dog, and it ran straight for him silently, its\nwide mouth gaping.\n\nHe shot it, saw it fall over as it was about to leap at him. When he\ndug his arrow out, he saw that it was no wormlike insect, no segmented\ncreature. It was a recognizable animal, a creature with two short\nstubby feet, two small extensions that were like hands on each side of\nan oval body. A definite head surmounted this, with one eerie eye set\nin the middle over its wide mouth. Two little breathing holes in the\nside attested to its possession of lungs. A long, curving rod grew out\nof the top of its skull and held a large yellow light-ball over it.\n\nThere was yet another peculiarity about this Moonhound, as Robin\ncalled it. It had no definite color. Its skin was faintly transparent,\nand he could see its inner organs shadowy within.\n\nAll this reminded Robin that there must be vast cavern worlds totally\nwithout light, yet having flora and fauna.\n\nWhen there is no light, there is no need for pigmentation. Hence, this\ncreature had none.\n\nRobin also surmised that it was probably the cold that drove this\nbeast into the lighted cavern in search of food, for he had never seen\nevidence of anything that large during the warm period.\n\nRobin brought the carcass back to his cave and went to work to skin\nand cook it. At first he was not going to, for the hairless, colorless\nnature of it was rather repellent. But one thing Robin had learned long\nago was not to let his emotions dictate to his needs. Like it or not,\nhe was going to make use of everything here he could. He had a task,\nand that was to survive.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the meat cooked very nicely, turned brown in the\nfire, and tasted good. Further, it had a bone structure, which the\nMoonworms hadn't, and Robin saved these bones, knowing that there were\nmany things that they could be used for. He remembered museum exhibits\nof bone needles, bone knives, and bone implements, including arrowheads\nand buttons that the Indians had made use of.\n\nAfter that, Robin deliberately hunted for these Moonhounds and caught\nseveral others before the winter was over.\n\nThe warmth returned about when Robin had figured, starting a day or so\nafter the surface sunrise. It rose rapidly, faster than it had fallen,\nand just as fast, new Moontrees were shooting up, new Moonmushrooms\nwere growing, and the river was becoming warmer.\n\nAs time went on and month followed month, Robin found himself working\ninto a comfortable, if primitive, routine. He charted exactly what to\ndo on what days. He could tell in advance what he would be eating, what\nhe would be harvesting. His rabbits had become sufficient in number to\npermit slaughtering, and he began to acquire a pile of rabbit furs.\nHe found it no longer possible to keep all his rabbits in one pen,\nand finally liberated the majority of them and left them to shift for\nthemselves. This worked out fine, and he never lacked the sight of\nat least one or two bunnies anywhere he looked. During the two weeks\nof winter each month they simply holed up as they might have done on\nEarth. It was an odd sight seeing the rabbits run wild, for their\npowerful leg muscles were many times stronger than was required by the\nweak gravity and, when they ran in a hurry, they would bounce many feet\nhigh in fantastic leaps.\n\nRobin was now wearing a rabbit-fur outfit of coat, pants, and hat\nduring the winter periods, equipped with bone buttons he'd carved from\nthe Moonhound skeletons. He was, if anything, beginning to gain weight,\nbut he was also aware of the paleness of his skin. He wondered whether\nstaying in this sunless world a sufficient number of years would not\nmake him as palely transparent as the Moonhounds.\n\nBut all this time Robin had not forgotten his ultimate mission--to\nreach the surface and signal for help. He had worked out the problem in\nhis own mind. He had to make some sort of space suit, something that\nwould permit him to venture out on the nearly airless surface long\nenough to set up a signal that astronomers might see.\n\nHe knew he had the materials for part of this suit in the metal\nsalvaged from the rocket nose. He could polish a section sufficiently\nto make a heliograph with which he could flash a code message to any\nhigh-powered telescope that might be pointed his way. But he had also\nto fashion the metal into an airtight space helmet, and that he did not\nknow how to do. The suit itself he could probably fashion from cloth\nand tanned skins, sew and seal it tight enough with animal fats and\nbone glue to be airtight for a short period, but he needed the helmet.\nHe had the glass for it too, the little peepholes for the camera\noutlets and a large circular plate that had been set in the very base\nof the cargo nose and evidently intended for a wide-vision camera shot\nof the Earth. This plate would be his face plate.\n\nRobin was aware of the hissing noise that he had first noticed on his\narrival, but he had never investigated it. It was far off, somewhere\nalong the wall of the cavern. One work period, when he found himself\nahead of schedule, he set out to find the source of the noise.\n\nFollowing the wall, with Cheeky running ahead chattering, the hiss\ngradually grew in volume. Robin made his way over a sharp cleft,\nskirted a large bubble-cave in the wall, and after about two miles of\nwalking, came upon the source.\n\nIssuing from a break in the outer cavern wall was a stream of blue\nflame. For several hundred feet around it no vegetation grew, the\nground being covered with thin gray ash. Robin looked at the loudly\nhissing lance of blue fire.\n\nIt probably was a breakthrough from some adjoining bubble, one filled\nwith a gas of some inflammable sort. Somehow in the course of the\nbreakthrough, this leakage had been set aflame. And there it was now, a\nburning gas jet, sharp and hot.\n\nAt that moment, Robin knew he had the answer to his metalworking\nproblem. He'd tried to melt the metal of the rocket over his fires but\nhe had been totally unsuccessful. But this jet, this hot blue flame,\nthis surely would do the trick!\n\nFor him the space helmet was now a certainty. It might take time, but\nnow it could be done. That and more was possible, for he had enough\nmetal to make a few necessities like a decent frying pan and a pot\nto use for boiling and perhaps a water container for a really long\nexploration trip.\n\nThat was the end of Robin's first \"Stone Age\" period and the beginning\nof his \"Iron Age.\"\n\n\n\n\n_10. The Incredible Footprints_\n\n\nUsing the gas jet proved to be considerably more difficult than might\nhave been supposed. It was hard to approach too closely to the thing\nwithout running the danger of getting scorched. Also, to hold metal in\nit long enough to allow it to melt or become pliable it was necessary\nto find a way of holding the object without getting burned.\n\nRobin did get several blisters before he finally worked out a system.\nMaking himself a pair of thick rabbit-skin gloves lined with a thin\ncoating of the ash from the area around the flame proved to be part of\nthe solution. A pair of bone pliers proved to be another part, though\nthe necessity of replacing these was continuous.\n\nWorking patiently then, Robin managed to cut and work some of the\nsheets of metal from the rocket nose. He made himself a hammer of hard\nstone with which to pound some shape into his pieces and finally had\nfashioned for himself a serviceable, though crude, frying pan and other\nimplements he needed.\n\nHis next project was to be the space helmet, the first essential part\nof any space suit. He considered this a long time, planning just how to\nmake it. He had a good sheet of metal for the job, but he didn't want\nto make any errors in working it, and he wanted to have as few seams\nas possible. Welding had thus far proved a task he had not mastered.\nHe considered making the joints airtight by means of some sort of\nvegetable- or animal-fat product.\n\nRobin sat in his cave watching the rebirth of life in the bubble-world\nafter one of the winter half-months and thinking. He watched his\nmonkey, Cheeky, turning over rocks for Moonworms--although the little\nbrown pet had never been able to eat them, he seemed to enjoy the\nhunting of these odd creatures. He watched the rabbits bounding around,\nlistened to those he kept penned up in the next cave.\n\n\"What am I waiting for?\" he asked himself, half aloud. The monkey\nstopped at the sound of his voice, looked at him. Robin had developed\nthe habit of talking to himself. He was aware of the danger that years\nof this hermit's life might well cause him to forget how to talk, and\nhe did not want that. \"I can't use a space suit until I can find a way\nto the surface--a safe way. And I've never even really explored this\ncavern itself. Maybe there's a simpler way of communication with the\nsurface.\"\n\nHe sat and thought. The monkey dashed over to him, jumped on his knee,\nchattering. \"I really ought to get about exploring this place,\" Robin\nwent on. \"You know, Cheeky, there might be some more things we can\nuse. What do you say, shall we spend this next week playing Columbus,\nlooking for more bubble worlds to conquer?\"\n\nThe monkey chattered happily, jumped off his knee, and ran around.\n\"Guess you like the idea,\" said Robin. \"Let's get about it, then.\"\n\nHe got up and made his preparations. He filled a sack with enough\nfood for several days. He took his homemade canteen, made from a\nhollowed-out Moontree fruit rind, filled it with water and hung it\naround his neck. He took his flashlight and knife, his bow and arrow,\nand his lantern of light organs. He had discovered that the little\nlight-giving bulbs the animals carried would glow for about two days\nafter their removal, and therefore he constantly kept this lantern\nrefilled with his latest catches.\n\nHe looked to see whether his special lot of penned rabbits had enough\nfood and water for the period and then, whistling to Cheeky, Robin set\nout. He went down to the bank of the flowing stream on which he had\nbeen originally carried and then set out to follow this rivulet its\nlength into the distances of the bubble-world.\n\nHe followed the flowing stream for about twelve miles. The bubble\nwidened out and the water, which had originally brushed the other side\nof the cavern where Robin had lived, had now narrowed as a bank of dry\nground formed on the opposite side. Robin found himself walking through\nan ever deepening thicket of growing Moontrees which went on for many\nmiles.\n\nThe stream twisted and moved off at right angles finally rushing into a\ndeep pool. Robin went over and gazed into it. Plainly the pool had some\nsort of underground opening, for the water was swirling around with no\nvisible surface outlet. So this was where the stream ran to! Doubtless\nit emptied into another bubble somewhere below, probably to fall like\na waterfall into that space, there to become another stream and empty\nstill again farther down until it ended in some vast reservoir of\nsublunar seas.\n\nBut Robin was not interested in going farther down, he sought a way\nupward toward the surface, toward the sight of Earth. He turned away\nfrom the whirlpool, walked boundingly on to the farther wall of his\nhome-bubble.\n\n\nHe reached it in time for his sleep period. It seemed as solid and\nimpregnable as the wall around his home region.\n\nRobin and Cheeky slept next to the wall and after their sleep resumed\ntheir search. Robin walked along the wall, looking again for some\nbreak. He saw in the distance a jagged line of black against the\nshining brown-gray of the cliff. When he reached it, it was a crack, a\nbreak in the surface of the bubble, reaching up several hundred feet.\nHe came up to it.\n\nIt was wide, about ten feet wide, and dark. Robin shone his flashlight\nin, but as far as its rays could reach it was a dark tunnel. \"Maybe\nthis is what we're looking for,\" Robin said to Cheeky. \"It seems to\nslant slightly upward. Maybe it will take us to the next bubble.\"\n\nCheeky peered in, walked in slowly and out of sight. \"Hey,\" called\nRobin, \"wait for me!\" He followed the scampering monkey.\n\nNow his lantern proved handy. The glow it shed could barely be noticed\nin the light of the great bubble, but here in the darkness of the\ncleft, the pale glow was distinct and definitely illuminated the ground\na few feet in front of him. On he walked, holding the lantern ahead of\nhim, watching Cheeky's long tail flick in and out of its circle of dim\nlight, as the monkey would dash ahead and dash back.\n\nSoon Robin found himself walking in almost total darkness, save for\nthe limited glow of his lantern. The floor of the cleft occasionally\nslanted sharply, sometimes breaking steeply downward, sometimes\nnecessitating jumps upward into the darkness. In the Moon's light\ngravity, Robin was a fantastic jumper, but the darkness made the\nproblem very disconcerting. It was a strange thing to have to leap\nupward into a black void in hopes that what seemed like a wall in front\nof you would turn out to have a top and be but a giant step upward. He\nsoared in the darkness, not knowing how near or how far the roof of the\ntunnel was, feeling strangely disembodied, the monkey clinging to his\nneck in transit.\n\nHe missed several such jumps, managed to avoid being bruised severely\nonly by the feathery softness with which he fell afterward. When the\ngoing was straight, Cheeky would leap down and go ahead.\n\nSuddenly he heard a screeching from the monkey. He stopped, flashed\nhis flashlight. The monkey was clutching the edge of a deep break, a\npit cut sharply across the floor of the tunnel. Robin quickly reached\nthe spot, scooped up Cheeky. His flashlight revealed the other side of\nthe pit several yards away. Turning its rays downward, he could see no\nbottom to this crack within the tunnel. He shuddered, thinking what\nmight have happened had he gone into it. Then, gathering Cheeky, Robin\nleaped.\n\nHe soared lightly across the abyss and landed safely on the other side.\nHe went on, slowly, carefully.\n\nA spot of light appeared before him. He stared at it and continued\nmoving forward. The light widened, became the end of the tunnel, became\nthe entrance to something new. He hastened on and burst at last into a\nnew cavern-world, the world of the next bubble.\n\nIt looked much like his old one, but it was definitely smaller. The\nrounded ceiling could be made out quite clearly and he estimated its\ndiameter as not more than a half mile. The far side of the bubble could\nbe seen clearly and this one, he noticed, even from where he stood, had\nmany such clefts and cracks in the wall. It was, he supposed, either an\nolder bubble, more cracked in the course of eons of moonquakes and heat\nchanges, or else it was more tightly knitted in a close mass of such\nbubbles.\n\nA thick jungle of giant Moontrees was growing here, stalklike plants\nresembling those he knew, but seemingly larger and more profuse. Robin\nstarted to walk through it toward the farther wall of the bubble.\nCheeky had leaped into the stalks and was swinging through them ahead\nof him, when suddenly the monkey uttered a terrified shriek and there\narose a strange high-pitched barking sound. Robin pushed through and\nsaw the monkey, high in the top of a Moontree and a strange sort of\nMoonhound leaping for him. This kind of Moonhound was considerably\nbigger than the ones he had seen in his original bubble. It was\nuttering the eager bark of a hungry beast sighting its prey.\n\nRobin unlimbered his bow and fitting an arrow into it, let fly. The\nsharp missile skewered the Moonbeast and the animal twisted in mid-air\nand fell thrashing to the ground. Robin dashed in and finished it off\nwith a blow from the stone club he carried.\n\nCheeky came down from the tree cautiously, advanced to the dead animal,\nand prodded it. Then the monkey uttered a shriek, bared its teeth, and\nbegan to pommel the dead body as if he had been the one to bring it\ndown.\n\nRobin examined the animal. It was similar in many ways to the\nMoonhounds, yet different, and Robin's private theory that the\nMoonhound represented the equivalent of a mammal type seemed verified.\nWhereas the Moonhound was a wolf or dog, this creature corresponded\nmore closely to a leopard or tiger.\n\nThe flesh of this creature seemed as if it might possibly make a\nsubstitute for leather--although it, too, was eerily transparent and\nit, too, possessed but one central eye and a large light organ.\n\nRobin trekked on through this jungle until at last he reached the\nopposite wall. He was aware as he walked that there was a good deal of\nnative life here, much more than had been evident in his own cavern.\nEvidently the first bubble was pretty much cut off from the general\nlabyrinth of sublunar caverns. For as Robin walked, he caught glimpses\nof other Moonbeasts, slipping in and out, sometimes surprised and\nscurrying away. Moonworms, the equivalent of Earth's insect life,\nwere here in plenty too, and there were many giant growths which were\ndifferent from those in his own cave, and some fruits of considerable\npromise were growing on them.\n\n\"We could do some farming now,\" said Robin to Cheeky. \"I'll bring back\nsome of the seeds from these bigger trees and plant them back home.\nIt'll give us some variety.\"\n\nThe monkey merely chattered and pushed on ahead.\n\nAt the farther wall, the original observation of many cracks was\nconfirmed. The wall was broken like an eggshell and Robin could see\nthat dozens of tunnels went out, probably leading to several other\nbubbles. He decided that the following day he would look for the ones\nthat seemed to lead upward. But it was the time for sleep again.\n\nHe found a little cave, similar to the ones in which he had made his\nhome, and there he and Cheeky ate their meal, cooking some of the meat\nfrom the Moontiger over a small open fire. The meat looked strange in\nits almost glassy appearance, yet it browned and tasted very good.\n\nA thin stream of water meandered out of one of the cracks and from this\nRobin drank and refilled his canteen. He and the monkey curled up, now\nfed and contented, and went to sleep.\n\nRobin awoke suddenly. He opened his eyes, puzzled. The monkey was\nscreeching somewhere. He sat up, called, \"Cheeky!\"\n\nThe little creature dashed back to him. It had been outside the cave\nand it was excited. It was chattering and complaining as never before.\nThe monkey jumped up and down in a perfect ecstasy of fury. Robin\nlooked at it in wonder. He'd never seen Cheeky so excited. He sat up,\nlooked around.\n\nAt first he saw nothing unusual. Outside the cave all was quiet. Then\nhe noticed that his food pack had been moved. It had been dragged\noutside the cave, and its contents pulled out.\n\nRobin got to his feet, went to it. Something had come into the cave\nsilently, had taken the sack, and had examined its contents. He looked\nabout, amazed and wondering.\n\nNow he saw that other things had been touched. His canteen had been\nrolled over and the stopper unplugged. The water that had been inside\nwas a little puddle on the cave floor.\n\nAlarmed, Robin strung his bow, notched an arrow, and looked carefully\naround at the surrounding vegetation. Something was there, something\nbig and cunning.\n\nHis eyes searched the ground and then he saw an outline in water from\nthe canteen. Whatever it was had stepped into the puddle and then\nwalked out of the cave. Robin saw a series of footprints.\n\nSomething that walked on two legs, something that took steps with a\nman-sized stride, something with three toes on each foot, that walked\nupright, was able to open bottles, look into sacks, and spy on sleeping\nstrangers.\n\nSomething that might well be to the Moontiger and the Moonhound what\nEarth man was to the Earth tiger and the Earth hound. Moonman!\n\n\n\n\n_11. The Glass Man_\n\n\nThe situation was so astonishing that for a while Robin did not do\nanything but sit down inside his cave and catch his breath. Somehow\nhe had assumed all along that he would not find anything on a human\nscale on the Moon. His life had been mainly confined to the first\ncavern-bubble he'd arrived at and this, as he now realized, had been a\nrather isolated one.\n\nUnconsciously, he had assumed that life in other protected airtight\nsublunar areas would be on a similarly low and limited level. Now he\nrealized that he had had no right to make such an assumption. The Moon\nmight harbor thousands and tens of thousands of bubbles; some might be\nhundreds of miles in scale; some, lower down, nearer the still-warm\nvolcanic heart of the satellite, might even approach tropical climates\nand show little of the semi-monthly seasonal changes. In such places\nlife might grow in profusion, might compel the kind of battle for\nexistence as would bring out the evolution of a brain-carrying creature\nliving on its wits.\n\nAnd, although he was probably a little farther away from the central\ncaverns at this moment, he was actually on the outskirts of the linked\nbubbles. In such border regions he might indeed encounter rovers and\nwanderers from the more prolific areas.\n\nBut the problem was now how to find this prowler. There was, he hoped,\nonly one of them. The creature was probably hanging around somewhere,\neven now, keeping an eye on Robin's doings.\n\nRobin got to his feet, looked through his provisions. He found a bit\nof rabbit meat, took it out, and skewered it on a cooking stick. He\nthen knelt inside his cave-refuge and built a fire, using his flint and\nsteel. Over this fire he hung the bit of meat and set it to roasting.\nHe carefully began to fan the smoke out of the cave, knowing that\nit would carry the new and tongue-tempting odor of cooked meat to\neverything in the vicinity.\n\nRobin slipped out of the cave and hid himself in a thick clump of\ngrowth nearby. Cheeky clung to his shoulder, hushed to silence. They\nwaited.\n\nAfter a few minutes Robin saw a slight motion in the vegetation at the\nother side of the cave entrance. He watched, and a moment later saw a\nhead thrust itself out, and then a figure emerge and silently stalk to\nthe cave and look in. It was manlike, walking on two feet and it had\ntwo arms. It was oddly misty, seeming naked and semi-transparent like\nthe other animal life.\n\nIn one hand the creature carried a long stick to which something sharp\nand glassy was attached--clearly a type of spear. The creature paused\nat the cave mouth, then seeing no one within and unable to resist the\ntantalizing curiosity of cooking meat and a small fire, it went inside.\n\nImmediately Robin dashed out of hiding, ran across the small space and\nblocked the entrance of the cave with his body. The creature within was\nbending over the meat, but on hearing Robin, it turned, and made a wild\ndash for the cave mouth.\n\nIt collided with Robin. For a moment there was a wild scramble of arms\nand legs and then Robin's greatly superior Earth muscles overpowered\nthe other's and the creature was caught. Robin held it tightly in his\narms, carried it into the cave, and sat it down.\n\nThe spear had been knocked aside in the tussle and Robin looked at it\nwith a glance. One glance was enough to make the young man realize that\nhe had had a narrow escape. Its tip was bright and as sharp as a piece\nof broken glass. If the creature had thought to jab that spear, it\nmight have been deadly.\n\nBut now the captured being was sitting quietly in a sort of\nresignation, merely looking at Robin with the same curiosity that Robin\nbestowed upon it. It was very much like a human being, perhaps some\nfour feet tall. But its head was somewhat triangular in shape, having\nonly one eye (Robin never found any Moon creatures with two), and was\ntopped with a large yellow light bulb that extended a foot above.\n\nRobin took the bit of meat, cut off a piece and held it out to the\ncreature. The Moonman looked at it, then reached out a hand and took\nit. It smelled it, then tasted it, and, finding the taste to its\nliking, swiftly gobbled it down.\n\nRobin ate some too, and this gesture seemed to reconcile the other. A\nfairly universal gesture, Robin thought. Only friends would share a\nmeal. Probably would hold true anywhere in the universe.\n\nNow Robin picked up the other's spear and examined it. Seeing this, the\ncreature picked up one of Robin's sacks and also looked at it.\n\nThe sharp point of the spear was something that looked like glass but\nglistened far more, seemed sharper, harder, and heavier. Robin turned\nit over, and the realization struck him that this spearhead was a\ndiamond, a single six-inch-long shard of diamond!\n\nAfter the first shock of this discovery, Robin realized that he should\nhave expected it. On such a volcanic world as the Moon had once been,\nthere might well be lots of diamond in great masses. What could be\neasier to use for weapons and cutting edges than chunks broken from\nsuch masses. Such a chunk brought back to Earth might be worth an\nemperor's ransom--but who could think of such values here?\n\nGetting the friendship of the Moonman proved to be easy after that\nfirst effort. For the creature made no further effort to escape, seemed\nitself to desire Robin's companionship. In fact, as it turned out,\nRobin would have had a hard time getting rid of it. It seemed anxious\nnow to stay close to the Earthling, to share him with Cheeky.\n\nThe glass-skinned being had a language, for it soon began to jabber\naway at Robin in a high-pitched squeaky tongue. After a little\nexperimentation, Robin was able to get it to repeat the name Robin, and\nin turn, he found out that the Glassie's own name was something nearly\nlike Korree.\n\nKorree was evidently a very primitive sort of savage in spite of his\nability to speak. As Robin set out to re-cross this bubble and return\nto his own holdings, the creature wound in and out ahead of him,\nreturning steadily to see if all was well. Korree had no clothes and no\nunderstanding of them. He had only his spear, which Robin had returned\nto him and he had apparently lost faith in that, the first time Robin\nused his bow and arrow on a yapping Moontiger.\n\nThe trip through the dark tunnels back to Robin's original bubble was\ncomparatively easy, for no sooner did they get into the darkness than\nKorree's light organ began to glow brightly enough to render Robin's\nlantern dim. When they came to the cleft, Robin had to pick the Moonman\nup and jump with him, for Korree's muscles were built only for Moon\ngravity and that leap was beyond his normal ability.\n\nOnce back in what Robin now thought of as the safety of his original\nbubble, the two settled down to work together. Korree soon got the hang\nof the simple duties Robin gave him--feeding the rabbits, slaughtering,\nskinning, and tanning. They spent the time trying to learn each other's\nlanguages.\n\nRobin carefully jotted down each new sound or word he could identify in\nthe Glassie's speech and Korree in turn seemed anxious to imitate the\nEnglish.\n\nIt took about four months before they had a working interchange of\nideas. Robin found that the Glassie's language was quite limited in\nmany ways, though having a great many variations of verb form--a\ntypical characteristic of primitive tongues. Finally, however, Robin\nheard Korree's story.\n\nHis people lived many bubbles away, possibly many months of travel,\nthough the Glassie idea of time was very vague and seemed hedged around\nby all sorts of untranslatable mystic conditions. There were maybe\nseveral hundred of them and they formed one big tribe or family.\n\nThere were many such tribes, usually one to a bubble-cavern. Korree\nindicated that somewhere--he pointed downward--were greater caverns\nwhere many tribes lived, tribes of great strength or magic or\nknowledge. Robin could not decide which was meant--probably all three.\nBut Korree had never been there. These downward regions were taboo to\nhis people.\n\nRobin's suspicion was that the Glassies from Korree's group had been\nforced to live in the less desirable outer areas by the stronger and\nmore advanced races who had seized the better regions.\n\nKorree indicated that there were many bubbles that were not inhabited\nbecause of great terrors, either by heat or cold. Robin assumed he\nmeant caverns of jungle and caverns more exposed to the surface\ntemperatures.\n\nKorree himself had broken some sort of tribal rule or magic and had\nbeen chased out of his home. He was a lonely outcast. That was why he\nhad gone with Robin when Robin had given him food. This symbolized\nacceptance into Robin's tribe. And though Robin looked to him like a\nvery strange sort of man indeed--a solid man, a \"rock\" man was the\nway Korree explained Robin's nontransparent flesh and his tremendous\nstrength--Korree had been glad to find acceptance anywhere.\n\nCarefully questioning Korree about the surface, Robin found that the\nGlassie had apparently no conception of what sort of a world the Moon\nreally was. To him it was a place of many enclosed spaces. The surface\nhe had neither seen nor even dreamed of. That there could be a place\nwhere the enclosures ended and the world \"dropped off\" into nothing,\nthis was something he could not imagine.\n\nRobin then asked questions about the upward regions. Korree indicated\nthat these were less and less habitable, that his people strove always\nto go down, never up. Robin twisted his questions around, trying to\ndetermine if the Glassies had ever seen anything that might signify the\nsurface. He described the sun and the Earth to Korree but the Glassie\nseemed unable to understand. But when he spoke of the sun as being a\nbright glowing thing so bright that it hurt the eyes to look at it,\nKorree seemed to remember something.\n\nCarefully the Glassie told Robin that he had heard of a tribe that\nlived somewhere in the upper regions, where in one part of their bubble\nthere sometimes came a terrible white-hot light that hurt when one\nlooked upon it. This light was not always there, but shone through the\ntop of the cavern, which Korree explained was like the substance of his\narm--that is, semi-transparent.\n\nRobin became very excited when he heard this. It sounded to him as if\nsomewhere up near the surface there must be an airtight cleft or bubble\nwhose outer crust might be natural volcanic glass. Through this the sun\nmight sometimes penetrate to produce the phenomenon Korree described.\n\nPlainly then, this was the place Robin must find. It looked like the\nideal place to begin his projected signaling to Earth. But whether it\nwas or not, Robin would have to make a visit there to see.\n\nKorree did not like the idea, but indicated he would be willing to go\nalong. \"Could you lead me there?\" Robin asked.\n\n\"Much hard,\" Korree replied. \"Can make do. You-me not like. Many-winter\ntrip, many bubbles.\"\n\nBut Robin was determined. \"We will go. First I must make a space suit.\nI may need it.\" Korree spread out a hand in acceptance.\n\nIt took about two months more to finish what Robin hoped would be\na workable space suit. The helmet he finally managed to weld into\nsomething like a practical shape. It fitted over his head snugly, the\nlittle glass plate in front of his eyes. Its seams were closed as best\nas could be managed and sealed with melted animal fat. The bottom of\nthe helmet fitted snugly over Robin's shoulders and would be attached\nto baggy leather arm-and-hand coverings. The bottom of Robin's body\nwould be simply encased in several layers of clothing made as airtight\nas possible.\n\nTo carry a supply of air, Robin fashioned a large sack of Moonhound\nskins, which, when filled with air and brought to the surface of the\nMoon, would swell up like a huge balloon. He hoped that by breathing\nfrom this reserve he might be able to survive on the surface for\nperhaps twenty or thirty minutes. This would be all he would need,\nhe estimated, to rush out, set up some sort of reflector or flare\nif he could contrive such, and dash back to safety. \"Safety\" would,\nof course, be some previously sealed dome extending to the surface,\nthrough which he could cut a space narrow enough to leave, and yet, one\nwhich would not be entirely exhausted of its inner gases by the time\nRobin got back to reseal it.\n\nThis was a long-chance project, yet it was the only hope Robin could\nthink of. The matter could at least be examined at closer range if he\ncould but find the cavern with the translucent roof. This would be an\nideal base for his project.\n\nRobin packed his equipment, liberated the last of his penned rabbits,\nand loaded as much food as he could in big sacks which he and Korree\ncarried. Then, preceded again by Cheeky's monkey bounds, Robin turned\nhis back on his \"home\" and headed back to the tunnel and the caverns\nbeyond.\n\nIt had been over a year and a half since he had been cast away on the\nMoon, perhaps nearer two years. And now he was ready at long last to\nbegin the long trek home.\n\n\n\n\n_12. The Long Trek_\n\n\nAs they progressed, Robin queried Korree as best he could as to the\nexact location of this fabled place from which the sun could be seen.\n\"I not know from here,\" the Glassie replied. \"Go from home place, yes.\nWe go Korree home place first.\"\n\nRobin thought about that as they trudged along. He went easily and\nlightly in spite of his huge load--a collection of sacks and equipment\ntied together to make a bundle more than his own height. But bundle and\nall, Robin was lighter and stronger by far than he would be on Earth.\n\"Won't they kill you if you go back?\" he asked the Moonman.\n\nKorree turned his head and Robin almost imagined he could see his\nbrains whirl. Through the glassy skin, he could see the shadows of his\nskull structure and the pulsing of veins and arteries. \"With Robin they\nnot do so. You make them give us free way.\" Obviously he regarded the\nEarthling as an all-powerful being to whom things like tribal death\nsentences would be mere nothings.\n\nRobin smiled uneasily. Without firearms and modern weapons he could\nstill be overpowered if enough of the Moonmen attacked him at once. He\nwould have to think about his approach to the tribe before he got there.\n\nThey reached the tunnel and made their way once more through its dark\nrecesses to the jungle-bubble where he had encountered Korree. They\npassed through this without incident. The Glassie led the way to one of\nseveral cracks and tunnels at the far end. With Robin following and the\nmonkey Cheeky perched on the huge pack, Korree entered this tunnel.\n\nAs before, it was dark and narrow and seemed to wind ahead. Several\ntimes they stepped around breaks in the floor, or ducked under low\npassages where the ceiling had dipped. They walked on, Korree's bobbing\nheadlight casting a pale-yellowish glow a few feet ahead. Robin was\nwatching the floor carefully, straining his attention to keep his\nfooting safe. His ears registered the echo of their motions and the\nchanging pitch as the tunnel widened or receded, but he paid less and\nless attention to this.\n\nSuddenly he looked up. And saw not the one glow of Korree's light but\na number of smaller ones around them, distant ones, bobbing slightly,\none or two yellow, one small white one, and three verging on red. He\nstarted and stared but Korree had said nothing.\n\nFinally he reached out and tapped the Glassie and whispered, \"What are\nthose lights?\"\n\nKorree said back in a normal tone, \"Animals. White light is hunting\neater. I watch it.\"\n\n\"Here? In this tunnel?\" asked Robin, startled.\n\n\"Not in tunnel,\" said the Glassie. \"In new bubble-place.\"\n\nRobin looked around. Sure enough he had not noticed the echo of their\nfeet in the last few minutes. The floor had changed from rock to sandy\ndirt and he realized that he had lost some of the enclosed-air feeling.\nIt was indeed a new bubble-cavern--but a lightless one!\n\nNow, as he looked carefully, he realized that there were many lights\naround. There were tiny ones bobbing on the ground that were probably\nMoonworms. The others were almost certainly those of various animals.\nHe took his flashlight out, suddenly clicked it on, and swung it around.\n\nThey were in an open area, sandy with sparse clumps of mushroomlike\nvegetation growing here and there. He caught the scurrying flash\nof several translucent animal bodies dodging out of sight from the\nunexpected light of his flash. And when the beam was off, he noticed\nthe headlights returning, augmented in number.\n\n\"There are many bubble-places without light?\" asked Robin.\n\n\"Many,\" said Korree. \"Glassies not live there, but many animals hunt\nthere.\"\n\nRobin wondered whether there might in fact be more bubbles without\nlight than with. He realized that that was probably the case; it very\nlikely explained the nearly complete lack of pigment in the flesh of\nthe native animals, the presence of the light stalks on all of them. It\nhad probably evolved originally in lightlessness, and the Glassies had\nmoved into the caverns fortunate enough to have natural phosphorescence\nonly after they had discovered them much later in their history. This\npossibly also accounted for the single eye of Moon creatures--the\nconditions for the use of two eyes to develop perspective and delicate\ndifferentiations of shading and coloring simply never existed.\n\n\"Are there animals here without eye or light?\" asked Robin thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes,\" Korree answered softly. \"Big eaters, they--\"\n\nThere was a sudden rush of sound ahead, a crashing of plants nearby,\nan instant winking out of all headlights, including Korree's, and then\nRobin felt himself thrown to the ground as something vast and huge and\nheavy seemed to envelop him.\n\nHe felt himself being smothered under a pulsing blanket of warm flesh,\na veritable wall that covered him from head to foot, crushing out his\nstrength. Robin recovered, ripped out with his hands, kicked with his\nfeet. He felt his strong Terrestrial muscles tearing into the tissue of\nthe creature, and swinging wildly, he got to his knees and then to his\nfeet, veritably lifting the entire bulk of the creature.\n\nHe reached for his knife and as he got it open he felt the sharp edge\nof a jaw and the hot breath of a large mouth near his ear. He thrust\nout with the knife hard and furiously, cutting the mass to bits.\n\nThere was a sharp screech and he felt the blanket of flesh pull away\nand struggle to withdraw. He got his flashlight with his other hand,\nflicked it on to see his opponent better.\n\nHe saw a wall of gelatinous flesh rolling back before him. It rolled\noff the prostrate but unharmed body of Korree, gathered itself in a\nmass and rolled rapidly away, uttering loud screeches. The thing was a\nball of flesh, several yards across. It had a wide, many-toothed mouth.\nIt had several flat flanged spots which were probably ears, and it was\nlacking an eye, lacking any light organ.\n\nIt hardly needed them. Obviously the thing simply rolled around in the\ndarkness of the cavern, guided by the sounds of moving animals, rolling\nover them, flattening out, and devouring them.\n\nKorree got to his feet. He said nothing, seemed to take it for granted\nthat the great Earthling would have bested this thing, of course, and\nstarted off again. Robin frowned, decided he'd have to watch himself\nlest the Glassie sometime really overestimate his capacities.\n\nThey traversed the rest of the lightless cavern without incident, this\ntime Robin keeping his flashlight switching on and off regularly, long\nenough to sweep the moonscape sufficiently to gain warnings of future\nassaults. Once they saw the ball-like bulk of a Moonbowler, as Robin\nmentally named it, in the distance, and they both carefully stopped and\nheld their breath until it rolled away.\n\nAt the far wall, Korree searched the various breaks until he found the\none through which he had originally come.\n\nThey passed through another lightless cavern, this one less of a desert\nthan the other, where giant mushrooms towered like great trees in the\ndarkness and where little chittering Moonmice ran about their feet,\ntiny green lights sparkling.\n\nThe next cavern was a lighted one and this was now almost familiar to\nthem. Beyond that was another lighted one through which a channel of\nwater flowed only to disappear into a tiny crack in the far wall. This\nwater, however, was yellowish and evil-smelling and made the entire\ncavern malodorous. Yet it too had its quota of strange vegetation.\n\nA series of rather small bubbles, not more than a couple of dozen\nyards across, came next, and then they arrived at a wide, deep one.\nThe spot in the wall which let out on it was near the roof of this\nbubble, and they made their way delicately along a series of faults\nand ledges. Looking down, Robin could see that a lake of some bubbling\noily substance filled the lower level of the bubble. Along one side,\ntucked in a corner near a tunnel opening, many hundreds of feet down,\nhe spotted something odd. He stopped. Korree turned back, made his way\nalong the narrow ledge and looked down to where he pointed.\n\nThere was a small cleared space just before the opening, and there were\nseveral objects too far away to be seen clearly, but they looked for\nall the world like some sort of eggs. As they watched, Robin saw what\nseemed a shadowy figure move near one. Because of the curious glassy\nskins, that was probably an animal. Robin softly asked Korree what it\nwas.\n\n\"Is Glassie like Korree,\" answered Korree quietly.\n\n\"A friend? One of your people? And what are they doing there?\" asked\nRobin.\n\nKorree shook his head violently. \"Not Korree people. That one is from\ndown place. Is mighty people from....\" He pointed downward to the\nMoon's core. \"They come here to take....\" He pointed now at the curious\nchemical lake. \"They bring back down with them,\" he finished.\n\nRobin gasped. Here was evidence of his reasoning. The Glassies that\nlived near the core of the Moon were higher in civilization. Here\nevidently was a place where something usable could be gathered--the\nfluid of that lake. Possibly it might be fuel for burning, or substance\nusable as tar or cement. The beings down below came up for it, put it\nin tanks--the egg-shaped objects--and brought it back to their greater\ncaverns.\n\nSomeday this would have to be investigated. If he ever returned to\nEarth, this would have to be explored. But now--were these unknowns\ndangerous to him? He asked Korree, who shrugged. In his halting\nfashion he conveyed to the Earthling that if the Glassies of the\nupper crust left those lower down alone, they were not bothered. The\nimplication however was that Korree's people were only too willing to\nstay out of the way of the powerful underlords.\n\nAfter several more caverns--the trip had already taken over a\nweek--including one marvelous one in which several flaming gas jets\nmade amazing patterns in an otherwise lightless world, Korree finally\nled the way into a large lighted cavern many miles wide, stopped and\nannounced, \"Korree home.\"\n\nRobin looked around, adjusted his pack and called to Cheeky to return.\nThe monkey, which had scampered on ahead, obediently dashed back and to\nsafety on the pack. This was an important moment to Robin. He mustered\nhis plans, and stepped out after Korree who had started out again\nholding his spear high in the air in some sort of native signal.\n\nFor a short while they walked without seeing anyone. They were in\na forest of ball-trees when suddenly they found themselves quietly\nsurrounded by Glassies. Evidently they had been trailed since entering\nthe cavern and at a sufficient distance from the tunnel mouth the\nGlassies had popped out of concealment.\n\nThere were about twenty or so, all armed with the diamond spears\nand they effectively encircled the travelers. Korree had apparently\nexpected this, for he showed no surprise, but Robin stopped short and\nCheeky started jumping up and down on the huge pack and shrieking at\nthe pack of beings.\n\nIt was odd seeing a mass of Glassies. Robin could see that they\ndiffered from each other as individuals. Some were larger, some\nsmaller, and the shadings within their bodies gave rather clear\nevidence of fatness, of recent eating, and such. Like Korree they wore\nno garments at all.\n\nOne of the Glassies said something sharply to Korree, who answered\npromptly. The spokesman had a black circle painted on his chest--this\nwas obviously a symbol of some sort of tribal authority. Robin stepped\nforward, walked up to this Glassie, who promptly withdrew, uneasy in\nthe presence of this unknown.\n\nFrom his pocket Robin took his pack of matches, the one that had been\nwith him all the way from Earth. There were still three matches left,\nsaved for just some occasion as this, carefully conserved by the use of\nRobin's flint and steel. Robin walked up to a small ball-tree nearby,\nheld the match aloft, then struck it, and rapidly held it to the\nstalklike trunk. After a second the plant caught fire and was a blazing\nmass.\n\nWhile the Glassies were gazing in amazement at this unexpected display,\nRobin drew in his breath, set his pack down, and gave a leap straight\nupward with all his strength.\n\nHe soared some thirty feet high and then gently floated down to the\nground again. This was a feat that anyone with Earth muscles could do,\nbut it was something that Lunar muscles had never been developed for.\nWhen the Glassies tore their eyes away from the burning tree it was to\nfind Robin apparently vanished. Looking around, one of them discovered\nhim in the air, floating gently back to the ground.\n\nWith one accord the Glassies shrieked and ran away. When Robin hit the\nground, he was alone with Korree--who looked as nearly smug as it was\npossible for his unearthly features to look.\n\nThe Earthling picked up his sack, whistled to Cheeky to come to him,\nand started off again. In a few minutes, Korree led him to the tribal\ncenter, the \"village\" of his people.\n\nThere were no houses or tents or any structures with roofs. Each family\ngroup apparently fenced off their section of ground with a barrier\nof low, pointed sticks, their points diagonally outward. Within this\nbarrier, the family squatted with their few possessions. There was no\nsuch thing as privacy among this primitive group. The females of the\ntribe apparently stayed within their family plots, with the young, the\nextra spears and hunting sticks, the leftover supplies of food, and a\npile in the center of each circle of what must have been some sort of\nblankets, apparently woven crudely from vegetable fibers. Robin assumed\nthat during the cold periods, these were used.\n\nThe males of the tribe were gathered before a central circle, watching\ntheir visitors approach. Korree went to them, stopped, and spoke at\nlength. Robin could not understand him, but he knew what he must\nbe saying. His Glassie friend was obviously first boasting of his\nfriendship with the magical stranger, then warning them of terrible\nconsequences if they failed to obey and honor the stranger, doubtless\ninserting a demand for his own full pardon of whatever tribal offense\nhad brought about his own banishment, and demanding the aid of the\ntribal leaders in assisting them on their way.\n\nWhen he had finished, Robin walked straight up to the Glassie with the\nchest marking, reached out and extracted from the tip of his quivering\nlight-organ stalk a copper cent which Robin had first palmed in his\nhand. To the astonished native, he presented this token--one of the\ncoins Robin had had in his pocket on his unexpected trip from New\nMexico.\n\nThe Glassie took it, stared at it. The face on the coppery-yellow coin\nseemed to hypnotize him. No one had ever seen such a thing--a bit of\nbright rock with a face on it! But this additional evidence of Robin's\nmagic clinched the argument.\n\nRobin and Korree stayed in that cavern for about three days. In that\ntime Korree managed to obtain fairly specific directions from one\nold-timer as to the cavern they sought. He had also evidently repaired\nhis tribal fences, for Robin could not fail to notice that Korree was\nalways accompanied by a group of anxious and placating Glassies. He\nimagined that when Korree returned to stay, it would be as a chieftain.\n\nThe nature of the tribe's culture remained much of a mystery. They were\nvery primitive, yet they seemed to have a complicated series of taboos\nand ceremonies. There was clearly a very definite code of marriage and\nfamily relations, though its limitations were puzzling.\n\nRobin discovered something about them, however. One of the circular\nenclosures was apparently a tribal storehouse, or temple, or arsenal,\nor magic circle--exactly what he could not tell--save that no family\nlived within and there were little piles of oddities carefully placed\ninside its magic circle. The penny Robin had \"pulled from the chief's\nhead\" reposed therein on a raised mound. The burnt match stick lay\nbeside it. The rest of the contents seemed to be curiously shaped\nstones, odd bits of animal skin, a skeleton of something big and round\nwhich might perhaps have been that of a Moonbowler slain by the hero of\nthe tribe. Several diamond spearheads were there, including some that\nhad fractured in use. And something that glistened like metal.\n\nRobin saw this latter, and, stepping boldly inside the magic circle,\npicked this object up and examined it. It was a knife blade!\n\nIt was nothing of Terrestrial manufacture. It was about nine inches\nlong and a couple of inches wide at the hilt, tapering down to a point.\nIt was edged on one side, and bore the marks of having been hammered\ndown and shaped by a hand mallet rather than ever having felt the heat\nof a forge. Engraved in its rather soft white metal were a series of\nodd hooks and lines that looked like writing of a sort. The hilt end\nwas jagged as if the blade had been snapped off in careless usage.\n\nRobin called to Korree and asked him about the object. Korree consulted\nwith the chief and returned. \"Sharp thing, it come from down-there\npeople,\" he said, pointing to the regions below. \"Glassie of those die\nin break of tunnel. We find, take this.\"\n\nWell, Robin thought, this adds to the evidence. There is some sort of\nhigher civilization below. Not yet at the fire-building stage, but\nadvancing at the dawn of the Iron Age. I wonder if this is really\nwriting or just a design? And I wonder what metal this is? Not iron\nsurely.\n\nHe thought a while, then deciding that as a creature of magic he could\nget away with it, informed Korree that he would take the knife blade\naway with him. The Glassies seemed unconcerned. It was evident that\nRobin was far outside their taboos.\n\nThe question of time among the Glassies was an odd one. The Earthling\nhad surmised as much in his observations of Korree. There seemed to be\nno effort to divide the periods into rest and work. Some hunted and\nworked when they felt like it, others slept at the same time.\n\nWhen the time came, Robin and Korree made their way out of the cavern\nupward along a ledge on one side of the bubble wall, through a fault\nhigher up and began to climb a sloping tunnel.\n\nFor several more days they traveled, always working upward, passing\nthrough bubbles of gradually diminishing diameter and sparser\nvegetation. At one point they waded through a shallow pond, at another\nthey choked in a sulfury cloud of gas that hung about. They squeezed\nthrough ever tighter cracks, and the air began to get distinctly\nthinner and harder to breathe. They were both getting exhausted quite\neasily; Robin knew they were nearing the surface and the spongy mass of\nthe Moon's interior was tightening.\n\nThen at last they stood in a tiny spherical bubble and gazed at a pool\nof brackish water at one end. There were no cracks in this little\ncave, no further tunnel or means of progress. \"What now?\" asked Robin,\nturning to his companion. Had they taken the wrong turn and come to a\ndead end?\n\nKorree went over to the water pool. He gestured at it, made motions of\nholding his breath. \"We go down in here, move under and come up ...\nout.\" He waved a hand in a down-and-under gesture. Robin looked into\nthe water. Maybe the Glassie was right. It was possible that the water\nat the bottom passed into a fault and led into another cavern. But\ncould he risk it?\n\nKorree nodded and without another word, suddenly jumped into the water,\nspear and all, and vanished. Robin waited. In a little while Korree's\nhead appeared again and the Glassie climbed out. \"Tunnel over there,\"\nhe said, waving beyond the wall of the bubble. \"Go up sharp.\"\n\nWell, there was nothing to do but to try it. Robin set down his pack\nand thought a moment. Cheeky the monkey was scampering around the floor\nof the small bubble. Robin took off his jacket and shoes, took out of\nhis pocket anything that might be damaged by water, and leaped into the\npool.\n\nIt was an eerie sensation. The water was as dense as on Earth but its\nweight was so much less. It seemed almost to lack substance as Robin\npushed through it, dived deep, and let himself come up again as far as\npossible.\n\nHe broke water in total darkness. He was outside the cavern, but\nexactly where he could not tell. Korree with his light organ had known\nand that was sufficient. Robin reached for a bank, felt a sloping wall.\nHe grabbed it, pulled himself up in the darkness. That much was right.\nThere was a tunnel here running steeply upward. He sniffed the air. It\nwas strange--breathable, but strange. This part of the Moon enclosure\nwas certainly cut off from the other sections, that was certain.\n\nRobin let himself back into the water, swam for the cavern, and came\nup in it. He got hold of Cheeky, opened his pack, and extracted his\nhomemade space helmet. He stuffed the monkey into it, closed end\nupward, and got into the water again. Moving swiftly under water, the\nterrified animal clutching the inside of the helmet, Robin transferred\nhim to the other side, found a small level section by probing around,\nand deposited the helmet. He returned for the rest of his pack by this\nmethod, and finally everything was complete again in the new passage.\nBy the light of Korree's head, he saw that they were in a narrow tunnel\nangling steeply upward. Robin's clothes and the pack had dried with\ngreat speed in the thin air and the low gravity. They made their way\nup this passage with difficulty and at last found themselves facing a\nlighted opening.\n\nThey emerged into a new cavern, but one quite different from those\nthat had gone before. It was long, perhaps two or three miles long,\nbut narrow, not more than a hundred feet or so at the widest. Looking\nupward, the steep perpendicular walls seemed to come together and\nclosed up tightly about a quarter of a mile high.\n\nA faint phosphorescence dimly lighted the new area. As they walked on,\nRobin became aware that there was no vegetation here, that his feet\nwere moving through light dust. He let it run through his fingers. It\nfelt chalky as pumice.\n\nHe looked around them again and then he realized that he had at last\nreached the surface of the Moon. He was walking through the bottom of\na long crack in the surface, a cleft that had somehow closed up again\nto preserve a cache of air. But this dust, this was the surface dust of\nLuna, fallen to the bottom of the cleft!\n\nAs they walked, the dimness seemed to diminish. A whitish glow began\nto envelop them. Robin blinked at the strange light. Things began to\ntake on strange colorations that he had not noticed before. He looked\nupward and saw that the ceiling of the cleft no longer was bathed in\nblackness. Instead there seemed a break there, a glassy glimmer through\nwhich poured a dazzling white light.\n\nSomewhere up there the crack had been sealed by volcanic action into\ngrayish natural glass. Somewhere outside the sun was shining down upon\nthe Moon. Its rays were bathing the surface above the concealed cleft\nand some were finding their way down. For the first time in many long\nand difficult months Robin felt warmth and light together. He had\nreached the sunlight!\n\n\n\n\n_13. The Sun and the Trap_\n\n\nThere had been a distinct chill in the strange surface canyon, but from\nthe moment that the white sunlight began to stream in, there was a\ndefinite warming effect. The rays were diffused by the substance above\nwhich sealed the cleft, yet the sun was strong while it lasted. Robin\nfelt good as he bathed in its rays. He looked at himself, at Korree, in\nwonder.\n\nFor the clear white light was the first normal lighting he had seen\nin all the time he had been marooned below. Now he received the first\ntrue color visualization of himself and his companion. He saw from\nhis hands that he had become very pale-skinned; all his normal tan\nhad been lost in the cavern worlds. He unpacked the bright, gleaming\nspace helmet and used it as a makeshift mirror. His hair had faded to a\nlight blond, and there were several white hairs now visible, the result\npresumably of his period of exposure to the unshielded rays of the sun\nduring his passage through space.\n\nIn the clear light Korree seemed even more transparent than ever,\nand indeed Robin could make out the shadowy, pulsating shapes of his\ninternal organs quite clearly--his skeleton standing out sharply. He\nrealized how dim and abnormal the phosphorescence of the caverns had\nreally been.\n\nReshouldering his pack, they continued up the deep canyon. In a little\nwhile, the gray ashy surface gave way to sandy soil and there was a\ndampness in the air that indicated the presence of one of the deposits\nof water. Now the familiar Lunar vegetation was making its presence\nknown and before long they were wandering through a very dense thicket\nof huge ball-trees and plants.\n\nRobin had never seen such a dense jungle growth on the Moon before and\nhe attributed it to the occasional bath of sunlight this one cavern\nreceived. It was like a hothouse, a natural one, more or less sealed\nwith a high dampness, natural warmth augmented by screened sunlight.\n\nSoon the two found themselves forcing their way single file through the\ngrowth, while Cheeky swung into the tops and made his own way, happy\nin the sort of thick, warm forest his monkey nature demanded. Robin\npushed his way through first, with Korree following in the path the\nEarthling cleared.\n\nRobin went on through the jungle, struggling in spite of his powerful\nEarth muscles to push his pack along. After a while he stopped to rest,\nlooked back. He saw behind him only the bruised and broken stalks of\nthe ball-trees he'd passed through. There was no sign of Korree.\n\nRobin stared, but the forest was too thick to allow much vision. He set\nthe pack down, called, \"Korree!\"\n\nThere was no answer. Somewhere in the distance a stalk snapped. Robin\ncalled again. Still no answer. He started back a few steps, retracing\nhis path, but there was still no sign of his Glassie friend.\n\nHe suddenly felt uneasy. What was going on here? How had his companion\nvanished? He went back to where he had left his pack, waited, again\ncalling his friend's name. But still there was no answer. There were\nmore crackling noises somewhere in the thick vegetation. Perhaps Korree\nwas in trouble there?\n\nRobin turned in that direction, started to push through the barrier of\ntree stalks. Suddenly there was a rushing noise, a chorus of shrieks\nall around, and something heavy fell around him.\n\nHe whirled, but something sticky and tight was encircling his body. He\ncaught glimpses of glasslike, one-eyed faces jumping around him, hiding\nin the branches, shrieking. He struggled again to free himself but the\nencircling Glassies threw more of the sticky ropes around him, more\nthings like barrel staves that fell and tied him up.\n\nHe struggled to use his full strength against them but his arms were\npinned to his sides, he was tight amid the stalks and he could not\nbrace himself. Fight as he might, he was caught, and he saw that there\nwere stalk-ropes attached to those that had trapped him and these were\nbeing further secured by the creatures around him.\n\nHe stopped struggling, quieted. It was obviously no use to waste his\nstrength. Let's see what they intend to do next, he thought.\n\nFor a while they did nothing. Then his Glassie captors--he still could\nsee little of them so thick was the jungle--seemed to be working their\nway together so that all their attached ropes were soon leading off in\nthe same direction. Then they started to pull.\n\nHad Robin chosen to resist it might have become a fruitless tug of war,\nbut he did not. He had decided that his best course was to go along\nwith them. Doubtless they would lead him to their village or at least\nto an open space where his great Earth strength might then come into\nbetter play.\n\nFor a while, therefore, he allowed himself to be led through the\nMoontree forest, dragging himself enough to give his captors a workout.\nRobin had cagily decided that the more tired they were when they\nfinally arrived, the better for him.\n\nAfter a time the thicket of plants came to an end and Robin found\nhimself, as he had presumed, at the native settlement. Unlike the ones\nhe had seen in Korree's home cavern, these Glassies were cavemen. They\nevidently made their homes in a section of this narrow surface-cleft\nwhere one of the walls was greatly pocked with holes and openings.\nThe cliff walls were apparently quite like pumice here. Under the\ncircumstances and because of the limited width of the area, it was\nquite logical that the inhabitants should have made use of these holes.\n\nThere were several dozen such cave entrances and Robin could see a\nfair number of Glassies around them, including women and young ones.\nHis captors, he now saw, numbered about fifteen, all male hunters like\nKorree. They hustled him along to a central cave, whose entrance was\ndecorated with blue circles, clearly the designation of their chief.\n\nKorree was already there, tied, as was Robin. He looked relieved to see\nthe Earthling, and also a little puzzled at seeing that Robin too was a\nprisoner.\n\n\"They catch me when Robin not looking,\" he said, explaining the\nobvious. \"I not like these Glassies' ways. I think they mean kill.\"\n\nRobin looked around at them. \"We'll see. Back in my land, we have a\nsaying, 'There's many a slip between the cup and the lip.' I think we\nwill get away. Wait and watch.\"\n\nKorree immediately showed relief. He had a profound faith in Robin's\nmagical abilities. To him, therefore, Robin's lack of fright was enough\nevidence that all was really well.\n\nThe band gathered before the chief's cave was waiting. Presently a\nvoice came from the cave darkness. It questioned one of the captors,\nwho turned and repeated the query to Korree. Korree answered at length,\nand his answer in turn was repeated into the cave.\n\nAt Robin's query, Korree said that he had just informed the hidden\nchief that Robin was a great man-beast who would destroy them all if he\nwas not immediately released and placated.\n\nMore cave talk and interchange. There was a delay for a while and\nRobin could faintly hear voices within the cave, as if the chief were\ndiscussing the matter with someone else. Then a command was issued. The\ncaptors pulled on the ropes and urged Korree and Robin to the door of\nanother cave. They pushed them into this and rolled a large boulder in\nfront of the cave mouth to block their exit.\n\nIt was dark inside the cave but not so dark that they could not see\nthat it was about twenty feet long and that there were a number of\npiles of stuff around, food possibly, or remnants of things. Korree and\nRobin eased themselves down on the hard floor.\n\nRobin studied the vegetable cords that bound him. He twisted his hands\nand pulled until he got his elbow up where he could exert pressure.\nThen he strained against one of the bonds. In a few seconds it parted\nand broke. In this way he snapped bond after bond until he was free. He\nwas sticky from them, for the stalks had been soaked in some sort of\nadhesive substance which had made them so effective. But the strength\nof Earth muscles was more than they had ever held before.\n\nNext Robin went to work on Korree's bonds and broke them off one by\none. The two silently stretched their cramped bodies. Korree glanced\nback at the dark end of the cave and his headlight organ glowed\nbrightly for a moment. Something among the bundles was stirring\nslightly. Korree said quietly, \"Another prisoner or a listener?\"\n\nRobin looked. Yes, there was something over there, apparently tied up\nalso. It might be a Glassie prisoner, or it might be some one of his\ncaptors trying to spy on them. He shrugged. Let them try. They couldn't\nunderstand English.\n\nThe two sat down near the entrance, conversed quietly. Korree was of\nthe opinion that the Glassies would eventually kill them in some sort\nof ceremony. Robin never had found out how different tribes of Glassies\nacted toward each other. Evidently they did not make war, but neither\ndid they have much contact or exchange. In general, they treated each\nother like suspicious strangers, avoiding contact whenever possible.\nBut it seemed now that when strangers did force their way into\nunwelcome tribal caverns, death was the result. This was fairly typical\nof the most primitive savages on Earth and it was evidently a rule for\nthat level of culture anywhere in the universe.\n\nFor a while then they sat silently, thinking about their plight. Robin,\nsomehow, was not too worried. He had become so used to the superiority\nof his muscles that he felt that he could eventually manage his escape\nwhen the time came. The question was, where could he escape to? This\nparticular region was not actually a part of the honeycomb of Luna's\ninterior--it was a cleft sealed in by a trick of volcanic fate on the\nvery surface. Probably it had no other exit than the one which led into\nit.\n\nAgain, escape though he might, could he save Korree too? He thought\nabout it in silence. Korree broke the meditations. \"Have hunger. Is\nfood here?\"\n\n\"There must be some around,\" said Robin, glancing back at the things in\nthe rear of their prison-cave. The figure back there stirred a bit. And\nthen there was a mumbling sound and a voice said something. The voice\nwas deep and strong, unlike the sound of a Glassie's tongue. But Robin\ncould not understand it. Korree too looked and listened.\n\n\"Did you understand him?\" Robin asked his companion.\n\nKorree shook his head. Now at the sound of Robin's words occurred the\nmost astonishing surprise that Robin had yet encountered. The unseen\nspeaker spoke again:\n\n\"Who is that? Is there someone here who speaks English?\"\n\nIt was a human voice! It spoke Robin's language, though the intonation\nand accent were not quite right. Robin and Korree hastened back to\nthe rear of their cave to the reclining figure of the speaker. In the\nlight of Korree's head-stalk, it was indeed a man, an Earth man!\n\nHe was lying, tied hand and foot, on a pile of scraps, but he was\nraising his head, staring at them eagerly. He was a young man,\nevidently not much older than Robin. His blue eyes looked at them with\nrelief and he smiled widely.\n\n\"You are a human! I thought I was dreaming when I heard a voice I could\nunderstand. You must be an American ... then the Americans must have\nbeaten us here after all!\"\n\nRobin knelt down by the man, worked at his bonds. They were tight,\nreal cord of nylon or some Earth-made substance. It took the combined\nstrength of the two of them to finally open the knots and free the man.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Robin asked, as he worked. \"Do you have a rocket on the\nsurface?\"\n\nThe man got to his feet, rubbed his muscles. He was dressed in a simple\nblue one-piece flyer's coverall. He was taller and slimmer than Robin,\nand his hair was tousled and reddish.\n\n\"My name is Piotr Ivanovitch Kareff,\" he said, bowing with a European\ngracefulness. \"I regret to tell you that my rocket is indeed on the\nsurface--but there it will stay forever. We crashed. But I am so glad\nto see you. You do not know how glad.\"\n\nRobin shook hands. \"I hate to disappoint you, but I must tell you that\nwe are in the same predicament. I have no rocket here. I was hoping\nwhen I heard your voice that you might have one we could go back in.\"\n\nThe other looked confused, shook his head. \"No rocket? Oh, that is too\nbad. Very bad.\"\n\nThe Glassie, who had been watching them without understanding too much\nof the rapid-fire quality of normal speech, suddenly said, \"Have hunger\nmuch. Is food here.\"\n\nHe turned his back on the two men, pawed through the scraps on the cave\nfloor, coming up with some of the provisions that Robin had packed with\nhim.\n\n\"I'm hungry, also,\" said the Russian. \"They have not fed me since they\nthrew me in here. Is this stuff good to eat?\"\n\n\"Try it,\" said Robin and the three sat down and ate. Robin sat munching\nand stared at the other man. The first human he had seen in almost two\nyears. A real live man! But where did he come from? How did he get\nhere? And how was it he was a prisoner?\n\nFor a while after they had finished, they looked at each other. The\nRussian spoke. \"You must have a story to tell me, Robin Carew. How did\nyou say you got here?\"\n\nRobin briefly outlined what had happened to him, the other listening\nattentively. When Robin had finished, he asked, \"Now I want to know\nabout you? It's your turn.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Piotr, \"I shall tell you.\"\n\n\n\n\n_14. The Man From Lake Baikal_\n\n\n\"I was an orphan of World War II,\" said Piotr Ivanovitch Kareff in a\nquiet voice, speaking precise English with a fair fluency. \"My family\nwere all vanished, I know not what happened to them. I was brought back\nto Russia by our soldiers and sent to a state school in the Urals set\nup to take care of such as myself.\n\n\"There I was a good scholar and I made myself good marks. When I was\nold enough, I qualified for study at a higher institute and was sent\nto a college for engineers. I was always interested in astronomy and\nrocket aviation and I was therefore trained along those lines.\n\n\"When I was eighteen, I was allowed to continue my engineering\neducation as a part of my military duty. I was in the army, yet still\nstudying, only this time I was stationed at one of the big experimental\ncenters we have deep in Siberia. You probably do not know about them.\nThey are very secret.\n\n\"The one I was at was located near the shores of Lake Baikal, the big\ninland sea in Central Asia near Mongolia. This was the biggest center\nfor the study of liquid-fuel rockets. While I learned the theory, I\nalso worked on the actual projects and helped fire many of our big\nrockets. These were designed after the German V-_2, the same designs\nyou Americans are also building on. We, too, had captured German\nscientists who had worked on these. They had much to show us, and one\nof the smartest of these men was the Captain Von Borck who even became\na member of the party or so he said.\n\n\"I am not a political man, I am really interested in rockets, so I did\nnot pay too much attention to these things. Von Borck may be truly\nbelieving what he desires, I do not know, but I think he is just what\nyou call an opportunity seeker.\n\n\"After my army service, I chose to remain at the Lake Baikal station as\na regular engineer. I worked on the thousand-mile rockets, and finally\non the satellite rockets, and I helped get them up there. It was a nice\nrace with you Americans. We knew a little of your plans--those you\npublish in the papers--and we always were urged to beat you. Sometimes\nwe did. Sometimes you beat us.\n\n\"At our centers we made a game of this. It was serious to our country,\nbut to us, men of science, all discoveries by human beings are great\nthings. We liked to think of our work as a great game of mental chess\nwith you Americans--with the pieces on the board carefully hidden from\nsight and reported only through guesswork and bad witnesses.\n\n\"When the satellites were up and flying their orbits around the Earth,\nyours and ours, the next game was obviously to race for the Moon.\nShould we plant the Red flag there, or you the Stars and Stripes? So we\nworked at that. We did not this time know what you were doing. Maybe\nyou had different ideas.\n\n\"So Van Borck discovered a means of using atomic explosions in a steady\nrocket stream and explained the principle. We worked on this motor\na while and finally the Ministry ordered the building of one rocket\nwhich could fly to the Moon with this super-powerful engine. At first\nour commander at the base said it should be a robot-piloted model, but\nMoscow did not want that. They wanted that men should go on that first\ntrip. They wanted that a Soviet man should be first to reach the Moon.\n\n\"They did not know about you, Robin, and your stowaway trip! Ha! But\neven the Americans do not apparently know about you, alas for both of\nus!\"\n\nPiotr stopped a moment, got to his feet, went to the door of the cave\nand listened. He came back. \"No one there watching us. I go on,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"So finally was built a big rocket with the first atomic explosive\nengine. Von Borck himself was going to go in it as its engineer. But\nVon Borck was not really a Soviet man, and I do not think Moscow was\nhappy about it. So they allowed for the ship to have a three-man crew.\nI was selected, because I am young and quick and have a good record,\nand also maybe because I have no family to be sorry I not come back\nmaybe. Arkady Pavlovitch Zverin was the third, who was also an orphan.\n\n\"Came a day when the big rocket was complete and ready. We said good-by\nto our friends and at the right time we went up the ladder and into our\nbig rocket. That day, which seems to me so long ago, must have been not\neven a week ago yet!\n\n\"We took off perfectly, we blasted for ten minutes--I thought my head\nwould burst--and we were on our way. Von Borck piloted it, but there\nwas really little to do. When it came time to reverse the rockets and\nmake our landing, we had trouble. Our gyroscope control was stuck and\nwe had to fight with it by hand to move it. This made a delay and when\nwe did get our jets reversed and working, our timing was off. Von Borck\nstruggled to slow us up and come to a real stop, but we were a little\ntoo fast. We came down blasting away, and we hit very hard.\n\n\"The rocket was partly smashed. The engines and tubes all crushed. The\nnose was badly jarred and poor Arkady was killed by the impact. Von\nBorck, too, was thrown from his seat, knocked unconscious on the floor\nof our little cabin. I was badly bruised, but I remained conscious.\n\n\"Fortunately for us, the little cabin remained airtight. When all was\nstill, I looked over what happened. I looked outside. We were in a\nlarge crater, whose bottom was crisscrossed with cracks. One of these,\nrunning into the distance, was quite glassy and I saw that something\nlike steam was issuing from a point near it. This meant to me that\nsomewhere underneath the surface there might be a place with air and\nwater.\n\n\"I had at first thought all was lost and I would remain in the little\ncabin until the air was used up or the food gave out. This would be\nonly a few days. But I thought that any chance, however little, was\nbetter than no chance. So I managed to get to the locker and get out\ntwo space suits. One I put on Von Borck who was still unconscious, but\nwhom I could not leave behind. The other I got into myself.\n\n\"I took the German over my shoulder and managed to get out of the ship\nthrough the lock which was still intact. Carrying my companion--it was\neasy, he was so light on the Moon--I explored the cracks near where the\nship fell. I found a way leading down and even a series of very natural\nair locks--a most unusual development.\n\n\"Passing through many caves and tunnels I made my way and finally got\nto this one. Von Borck had regained consciousness but he was not in his\nright senses. He was talking nonsense. He believed--I do not know how\nto put it--he was the King of the Trolls. He thought he was somewhere\nin--fairyland or hell or some supernatural place. He did not remember\nthe trip.\n\n\"When we first met these Moon people--you call them Glassies--Von Borck\nsaid they were his Trolls. He killed four of them with his own hands\nand the rest became afraid of him, thought him a god or demon come to\nrule them. He let me alone a little while, then he seized me, tied me\nup himself, and put me here.\n\n\"I am afraid that he plans to sacrifice us. He is completely crazy and\nhe has these Glassies obeying him. I am sorry for us.\"\n\nPiotr stopped talking. He looked at Korree appraisingly. Robin\nunderstood his intention. \"I'm afraid that Korree won't have any\ninfluence with these Glassies. They are a different tribe.\"\n\nRobin rubbed his hands a bit. \"I really think we should be able to\nescape, even so. We now outnumber Von Borck two to one and I think if\nwe pick our time we could manage to make a getaway. We'll have to be\ncareful. Do you think you could get back to your rocket on the surface?\"\n\nThe Russian nodded. \"I guess we could. I was planning to go back from\nthe start.\"\n\n\"Is there anything there we could use to signal the Earth with?\" asked\nRobin. \"A radio, flares, mirrors?\"\n\nPiotr nodded. \"We had speaker-radio equipment, but it was smashed in\nthe landing. It was the first thing I tried after we hit. But we do\nhave flares. We could signal with them.\"\n\n\"I imagine,\" said Robin, \"that both the Americans and Russians must\nbe working on Moon rockets now. If we can signal back there, the next\nrocket along might come to this crater and find us.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said the Russian rocketeer. \"Only how do we get to the surface?\nI have a space suit, which is probably in Von Borck's cave. Von Borck\nmust have a suit too, if we can find it, though I think it will be much\ntoo big for you.\"\n\nRobin explained about his homemade space suit. Piotr was quite\nimpressed. The suit which was packed in Robin's big sack was in the\nprison cave where it had been thrown and they unpacked it. Piotr\nexamined the helmet with interest. \"Very good. It might work. It seems\nairtight.\"\n\n\"I tested it under water,\" said Robin. \"It didn't leak any bubbles.\"\n\nThe Russian nodded. \"But I don't believe your big bag of air would\nwork. How would you blow it up in the first place? I think you would\nhave had a hard time anyway. But fortunately there are three oxygen\ntanks on my own suit. I can detach one for your use.\"\n\nHe nodded, looking over the homemade helmet. In the half light of\nthe cave Robin looked at his new friend with interest. There was\nsomething about his face which struck an odd chord in Robin's mind.\nSomething about him brought back faint, almost forgotten memories, dim\nfrightening memories of bombs exploding, of falling buildings, of a\nfrightened child, and great loss.\n\nRobin suddenly asked, \"How did you learn to speak English so well?\"\n\nPiotr looked up. \"I was wondering when you would ask that. I always\nknew English, I spoke it as a little child. When I was found by the\nsoldiers in Dresden, I was but a little boy, maybe six or seven. I\nspoke some German, but mostly I spoke English. They could find no sign\nof my parents, my family, so they took me back to Russia with them. I\nstudied English too in school, but I always knew it.\"\n\nRobin started, his heart pounding very strangely. \"Where did you get\nyour name? That's Russian.\"\n\nThe other stared at him hard. \"No, it's not. My name--Piotr Ivanovitch\nKareff--means Peter the son of John Kareff.\"\n\nRobin was sure he knew now, but he doggedly insisted on his next\nquestion. \"My father's name was also John. John Carew. And how do you\nspell your last name?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Peter, a curious smile beginning to force its way to his\nlips, \"just like it's pronounced in Russia--Kareff--C-A-R-E-W--Kareff.\"\n\nAnd at the same instant, tears of joy sprang uncontrollably to their\neyes and the two brothers grabbed each other, laughing and pounding one\nanother's back in wild reunion.\n\nKorree stared uncomprehendingly at the curious sight of two Earth men\napparently taken leave of their senses.\n\n\n\n\n_15. Getaway Bomb_\n\n\nAfter they had recovered from their outburst of enthusiasm the two let\ngo of each other and sat down out of breath. \"Well, this is really\namazing,\" said Robin finally. \"Here I have to go to the Moon to find my\nbrother. You know I really do not remember very much.\"\n\n\"Of course not. You could not have been more than four years old when\nwe parted. I was about three years older, I guess. Perhaps we can put\nwhat we do know together and find out what did happen. I know that\nFather and Mother were interned in Germany by the Nazis. That when\nthe war was nearing its end, the Germans started to move them and\nother prisoners around. In the confusion, we were stranded somewhere\nand there was heavy bombardment going on. I lost you and Mom and Dad\nsomewhere, wandered by myself for many days. I was with a band of\nRussian people who had been taken to Germany by the Nazis to do slave\nlabor. They were making their way back to their homes and I clung to\nthem. So the Soviet Army simply counted me among its own orphans and\ntook me back. But maybe you know more about our family?\" Peter looked\nexpectantly at his younger brother.\n\nRobin nodded. \"I don't remember what happened. I was too young. I only\nremember being terribly frightened and alone and things going bang.\nWhen I was older I looked up the orphanage records. It seems that Dad\nhad been some sort of business agent in Germany and when the U.S.\ngot into the war he was interned along with Mom and the two of us.\nEvidently they were killed in some sort of bombardment at the war's\nend and I was the only one who survived. You are listed as having been\nkilled with them, according to the American Army report.\"\n\nKorree was moving restlessly during this conversation, not\nunderstanding very much of it. Now he pulled at Robin's sleeve,\npointed. \"Look. Cheeky come.\"\n\nSure enough Robin's simian pet had finally found them. Evidently having\neasily avoided capture by the Glassies, the little animal had been\nsearching for his master. Now his little head appeared around the edge\nof the big rock that sealed their cave. At a whistle from Robin, Cheeky\npushed his way through the narrow gap and scampered to his friend.\n\nPeter watched the monkey with interest. \"I wonder if we can't make use\nof your pet to help us get out of here,\" he said. \"We really ought to\nstart thinking of escape. I don't know when Von Borck will take the\nnotion to start something bad.\"\n\n\"Well, let's start planning it out,\" said Robin. \"First, we ought to\nsee what we have to work with. I think that the Glassies simply threw\neverything I had with me in here too. That should make things fairly\nsimple. What did they have of yours?\"\n\nThey went over to the pile of things, with Korree along to light the\nway, and examined it. Everything was present. Of Peter's property, his\nspace suit was there, intact, with its three shoulder oxygen tanks.\nRobin picked up a gun belt that had evidently been part of the outfit,\nbut the holster was empty. Peter commented, \"Von Borck took it when he\nturned on me. He is armed also.\"\n\nBut Robin noticed that the German rocket pilot had evidently not\nthought to take the pack of additional pistol ammunition that was\nclipped to the belt. He withdrew a clip and turned it over, then said:\n\n\"We should be able to use these to start a diversion of some sort. If\nwe can get their attention elsewhere, we can easily push aside the\nrock that seals our cave and make a run for it. We ought not to wait\nfor Von Borck to make up his mind.\"\n\n\"Ah yes,\" said his brother. \"There is good gunpowder in those bullets.\nWe could make a small bomb for a fuse or a display.\"\n\n\"I think a bomb will do the trick. Let's get at it.\" Robin suited\nhis action to the words. He sat down, spread a clean piece of cloth\nhe found among Peter's property on the floor and began to pull the\ncartridges apart and gently shake out the powder.\n\nBack on Earth, such a job would have been hard without instruments\nand great force. Here on the Moon, it was not easy but their strength\nenabled them to twist off the metal rims. Soon they had a neat little\npile of explosive powder gathered together.\n\nThis they packed into a small glass tube among Peter's explorational\nequipment until it was tight and filled the space. They twisted a dry\nfiber until it was cordlike and rolled it in a little remaining powder\ntill it was thoroughly blackened. This they inserted in the end of the\ntube as a fuse.\n\n\"Now we should get our stuff together and get ready,\" said Robin. \"I\ndon't think it would be a good idea to go back the way I came in; we'd\njust be cutting ourselves off. The idea is to reach your rocket on the\nsurface. Which way did you come?\"\n\nPeter indicated the opposite direction. \"I came in through a hole\nrather high in the wall, came down here along a narrow ledge. I can\nfind it again, I think.\"\n\n\"Then let's get into our equipment and get ready,\" said Robin. He began\nto load his huge pack again, but Peter intervened.\n\n\"You really can leave some of that behind now,\" he said. \"Make it\neasier to move fast. Besides we've got some narrow places to squeeze\nthrough on our way to the surface. I'd suggest leaving most of the food\nbehind. Take enough for a couple of meals more. You'll only need your\nspace helmet and space clothes.\"\n\nPeter was climbing into his space suit, an airtight rubberized affair\nwith electric heating grids. This on, he put on his space helmet for\nthe sake of convenience, though he left the little panel of the face\nwindow open. Robin slung his own helmet from his shoulder--its vision\nplate, being homemade, was fixed in place.\n\nWhen they were ready, they went over to the entrance and peeked through\nthe narrow, open space. \"Why, it's dark outside!\" said Robin.\n\nWhere before the deep cleft had been lighted by the white light of the\noutside sun, now it was dark. It was not as dark as the bubble-caverns\nbelow had been, for a faint light still penetrated down from the\nceiling. They could make out the darker shadows of the surrounding\ngrowth, and the Glassies outside were moving figures each illuminated\nby a small circle of light from their head stalks.\n\n\"Evidently the sun is going down on the Moon's surface,\" said Peter.\n\"It was low on the horizon when my rocket arrived. I wonder how cold it\nwill get in this place?\"\n\n\"It seems to be a little colder already,\" said Robin. \"This may bring\nVon Borck out of his cave to see what's happening.\"\n\nRobin called to Korree, explained what they were about to do. Then\nwhile Korree kept a hand on Cheeky, the two Earthlings leaned their\nshoulders against the big boulder and pushed it aside easily--an effort\nwhich would have blocked Moon muscles.\n\nKorree had dimmed his headlight and the two men kneeled down and\ncarefully lighted the fuse of their bomb with Robin's flint and steel.\nThe end of the fiber sputtering, Robin took Cheeky and pressed the\nglass vial into the monkey's paws. \"Over there,\" he whispered to the\nmonkey urgently, and pointed a finger to the darkness opposite the\ndirection in which they would be heading. \"Take it over there and leave\nit,\" he whispered.\n\nHe'd often taught Cheeky to fetch and carry, and he hoped the animal\nwould obey. It did. Grabbing the glass tube with its smoking fuse, the\nmonkey dashed off into the darkness.\n\n\"I hope he remembers to drop it and come back,\" said Robin. Peter\nnodded. \"Let's get started.\"\n\nThe men and Korree started slowly out of the cave. There was a very\nfaint dimness about them, a starlight glow that was just enough to\ndistinguish the presence of objects. They moved slowly, avoiding the\ntelltale lights of passing Glassies. Korree kept his own stalklight\ndark.\n\nSuddenly the peace and darkness were split by a sharp, violent\nexplosion somewhere behind them. Immediately following was a\nscreeching, recognizable as the sound of an angry monkey and almost as\nfrightening.\n\nFor an instant there was stunned silence and then pandemonium broke\nloose. Glassies came running in all directions, slamming into each\nother, not knowing what had happened. Some were running away from the\nnoise, some were running to investigate the terrible bang, and others\nwere simply running for cover in the caves. In the mad helter-skelter,\nRobin and Peter and Korree ran as fast as they could to the far end of\nthe cleft.\n\nThey dodged tree stalks, pushed through other patches, stumbled\noccasionally over obstacles, but carried on. Robin noticed even as\nhe ran that the vegetation was already drying up and dying rapidly.\nThe cessation of sunlight had probably been quite abrupt as the sun\nhad sunk behind whatever crater walls made up the horizon above them.\nEvidently the growth here was geared to a short, heavy life and sudden\ndeath.\n\nOver the frightened, high-pitched voices of the Glassies, Robin now\nheard another sound, the roaring voice of a man. Von Borck had been\nbrought out. He was yelling something, shouting angrily.\n\nPeter called to Robin as they dashed along. \"He's trying to get them to\norder. He knows we did it. But they don't understand him.\"\n\nOn they ran. Now behind them they heard some signs of pursuit.\nEvidently Peter was overoptimistic. Somehow Von Borck must have\nmanaged to get the Glassies to realize his meaning. Hitting some and\nshoving others, he had clearly gotten a few, who were still in awe\nof his \"magic,\" to follow him. They could hear the sounds of stalks\ncracking far behind them as they ran. But they had a good head start.\n\nRobin had been hanging on to Korree's arm, dragging him with him in\nhuge, leaping steps. But as they dashed on, he realized that Peter was\nslowing his own steps to accommodate and that the sounds of Von Borck's\nrush behind them were beginning to be louder.\n\nKorree evidently realized this too. \"Leave me,\" he gasped. \"I make\nout.\" With a twist he slipped out of Robin's hand and ran into the\ndarkness.\n\n\"Wait!\" yelled Robin after him, stopping. But Peter turned back,\ngrabbed his brother. \"He's right. He'll be better off here. We couldn't\nget him to the surface anyway. Come on! Quick!\"\n\nWith a sudden lurch of his heart and lump in his throat Robin\nrecognized the truth of this. He grabbed Peter's hand and the two of\nthem started off faster than ever, heading for the far wall in huge\nEarthborn leaps.\n\nIt was an eerie experience dashing madly along in the near blackness\nof the cleft. The faint glow which came from above, probably only the\nlight of a million million faraway stars, filtered through the curious\ntranslucent material of the cleft top, serving only to make patches of\nblackness against patches of even greater blackness. Far behind them a\nfaint flickering indicated the movements of the natives. Now and then a\nstartling flicker would prove the presence of some startled Moonworm,\nuncovered as a stalk was thrown over in the rush.\n\nBehind them they could hear a crashing and every now and then a shouted\nword. Robin wondered what was being said, but Peter, sensing his\nwonder, gasped out, \"He's shouting ... the word for devils! When ... he\ncame to ... he believed himself ... in some sort ... of Troll\nkingdom ... with me ... as a ... devil.\"\n\n\"Crazy! Stark raving mad!\" shouted Robin back.\n\nOn they went. The helmet banging against Robin's back made him feel\nclumsy and odd, yet he moved through the air with the agility of a\nphantom.\n\nNow, suddenly, there loomed a dark wall before them and they caught\nthemselves back just in time to keep from smashing headlong into it.\n\"The wall!\" shouted Robin.\n\nPeter pulled his arm, started hurrying along to one side. He gave a\nsharp cry of relief, pulled Robin to him. \"Here we are, the ledge. Go\non up!\"\n\nPeter started off. Robin followed as fast as was possible. There was\nevidently a thin ledge running up the side of the cave. In places it\nwas a gentle slope angling upward, in other parts there was a sudden\nstep. In their haste there was no time to pick and choose their steps.\nSeveral times Robin tripped, almost falling, but he had built up such a\nmomentum that he simply slammed and banged over the obstacles, charging\nup the ledge with a luck and agility that would have made a mountain\ngoat jealous.\n\nBehind them, at the base of the cliff, they now heard Von Borck's\nroaring. \"_Teufel!_\" he was calling. Then suddenly from where the\nmadman stood, there beamed out a flash of yellow light. A flashlight,\nthought Robin, he had a flash.\n\nThe beam passed rapidly over the cave wall seeking the escapers. Once\nor twice they froze against the side as it passed over them, dashing on\nas soon as it was gone. Then Von Borck's light caught them, held them.\n\n\"Keep running,\" yelled Peter, \"it's not far now!\"\n\nThe two kept up. Then there was a sharp report below them and something\nwent _spang_ on the rock wall near Robin. A bullet ... the mad rocket\npilot was firing at them.\n\nNow they simply raced on, ignoring the German's wild shots. \"Here we\nare!\" gasped Peter and seemed to melt right into the cliff face. Robin\nsaw the black opening in the next second and tumbled into it, to be\ncaught by his brother's arms.\n\nFor an instant they stood there in the darkness, catching their breath.\nThen a light appeared in Peter's hand, and Robin saw that he held\nan electric torch there, part of his space-suit equipment. The beam\nilluminated a narrow, dark tunnel leading steeply upward apparently\nthrough the solid rock.\n\n\"This way!\" said Peter and started off. Robin followed him on into the\nnarrow path that would lead him at long last to the surface of the\nMoon.\n\n\n\n\n_16. On the Crater Floor_\n\n\nThe tunnel was very narrow, a mere crack in the wall, and Robin was\nhard put to squeeze through in a couple of spots. But it was not too\nlong and, in a few minutes, Robin felt from the change in air and echo\nthat it had opened out into a wider area.\n\nPeter's flash confirmed this. They were in a small air-pocket bubble\nseveral yards wide. They crossed this while Peter searched along the\nfloor. He stopped, pointed down.\n\n\"We go down again, through this hole in the floor. There's a short\ndrop of only a few feet, but be careful.\"\n\nPeter stepped over to the hole, sat down, and eased himself out of\nsight. Robin looked down, could see the floor of another cave just\nbelow. He dropped his pack through and squeezed down.\n\nHere they were in a sort of shallow flaw running lengthwise, and they\nhad to walk in a crouched position to keep their heads from bumping the\nlow ceiling.\n\nRobin wondered how Peter knew which way to go, but looking carefully,\nhe realized that his brother was only following the trail of his\nfootsteps made on arriving--for there was a thin coating of dust on\nthis floor that showed the trail.\n\n\"How did you ever find this passage?\" asked Robin, his voice echoing\nflat and high in the passage.\n\n\"Saw the sealed cleft top running across the bottom of this crater.\nFound a spot near it where some sort of gas was hissing out. Went down\nit, and simply followed every lead that pointed in the direction of\nthe cleft.\" Robin knew that behind this reply undoubtedly lay a lot of\nsweat and agony. Peter had made the trip carrying an unconscious body\nwith him!\n\nThe low passage ended in a small cave-bubble. A break at the top of\nthis was the next line of direction. Peter had simply dropped down on\nhis arrival, but they waited to catch their breath. They would have to\njump for it.\n\n\"Do you suppose Von Borck is following us?\" asked Robin while waiting.\n\nPeter shook his head. \"I doubt it. First, we'd probably have been able\nto hear him coming. Second, he'd still know enough to go get his space\nsuit before following us. Third, he won't remember anything of this\ntrip and will have to find his way.\"\n\nRested, Robin gave Peter a boost, hoisting him as high as he could to\nthe top of the cave-bubble. Peter jumped the short distance remaining,\ncatching a grip on the edge of the hole in the cave ceiling. He pulled\nhimself up, then dropped his nylon cord down for Robin to grasp and\nhelp himself up.\n\nUp above there was still another small bubble, broken on one side. A\nwhole series of broken bubbles lay revealed, and they walked along this\nsection gingerly. This area was greatly cracked and seamed. It was\nclear to them that there was a possibility of a fall-in.\n\nBeyond that group they came to another break leading upward, and again\nthey moved on. Now Robin found himself breathing very heavily. \"I'm\ngetting very tired,\" he gasped at last.\n\nPeter stopped. They were still in the break and a severe slope was\nrising before them. \"It's the air pressure. It's getting quite low\nalready. You've been used to the low pressure of the bubbles below, as\nyou tell me, but we are close to the surface and the limited amount\nof air sealed in this particular bubble-system is thinning beyond\nthe safety point. We'll have to go slow and rest often. I don't want\nto have to use our oxygen supplies until we are at the limit of our\nnatural abilities.\"\n\nRobin finally caught his breath, felt power returning. Now the two\npushed on, going very carefully and slowly, with rests every few steps.\n\nThe steep rise ended at a narrow opening. Peter paused here, motioned\nto Robin to join him. \"This is the crisis point,\" he said. \"Listen.\"\n\nRobin strained his ears. He was aware of the pounding of his heart\nstruggling for oxygen. He was aware of a ringing in his ears from the\nlow pressure. But now he heard over that a thin whistling, a high,\nsteady rustling whistle coming from somewhere across the narrow, long\ncave he was looking in upon.\n\n\"What is it?\" he whispered.\n\n\"A most unusual phenomenon,\" whispered Peter back. \"The only thing that\nkeeps the air in all this subterranean region from being sucked away to\nthe surface. It's a volcanic current of hot gas, racing through this\nlong channel at tremendous speed. It must come up from somewhere in the\nstill-warm interior; it must be rushing to some vast cold spot below.\nBut it serves as an effective curtain cutting off the stale air on this\nside from the near-vacuum of the surface. Its density, velocity, and\nheat perform the miracle.\"\n\nPeter shone the lamp across and down the cave. The passage cleared a\nlong, tunnellike channel which ran down into darkness on one side and\naway into equal darkness on the other. Only a few yards across from\nthem he could see the gray surface of the wall. There seemed to be\nnothing else except the whistling noise.\n\n\"Edge along the wall here carefully,\" said Peter, and started off. He\nkept one shoulder rubbing the wall near them and walked carefully down\nthe passage.\n\nRobin edged out, following him closely. He felt no movement of air,\nyet he detected a faint trace of warmth on his outer side. Somewhere,\ninvisible to him, that cataract of volcanic air was flowing. Was it a\nfew feet or a fraction of an inch? He could not tell.\n\nThe wall bellied wider a little, allowing a chance to get farther away\nfrom the unseen wind. Peter was waiting here. \"I think we'd better\nadjust our space equipment now. We have a short way to go, then we'll\nhave to fight our way across that air blast. There's an opening to the\nsurface at one point nearby. Once we cross the wind and get to it,\nwe'll be outside.\"\n\nRobin let down his pack. Peter examined Robin's equipment again,\nlooking worried. He shook his head once or twice. \"I hope it works out\nall right, but some changes will have to be made.\"\n\nHe took the big bladder Robin had constructed as an air bag. \"This\nwon't work, but it will come in handy in a different way.\" He took\nRobin's pocket knife and began to cut the big sack apart to make thin\nlong strips of leather. When he had finished with that, he looked over\nat Robin and said:\n\n\"Now you'll have to wind these strips around you as tight as you can.\nBegin as high up on your chest as possible, and go on down. Wind them\naround your arms and legs, around your fingers, if possible. Don't\nundress, but wind the strips over your clothes. Make them tight. I'll\nhelp you.\"\n\nAs they worked to do so, Peter explained further. \"Having an air helmet\nis not enough for space. The pressure of your blood and the gases\nin your system will make it impossible for you to breathe or move,\nif your body is not tightly encased. A real space suit like mine is\npressurized, built with a layer of air pockets all over, which increase\ntheir pressure in proportion to the decrease outside. But if you don't\nhave this pressure, even having air around your head will not help. So\nmake those bandages tight, as tight as you can without stopping your\nbreathing completely.\"\n\nThey worked on, winding the leather around and around, until Robin felt\nas if he were being encased in a strait jacket, felt like a living\nmummy. Strips were wrapped around his fingers under his gloves, his\ngloves fitting over them and further strapped.\n\nNext Peter strapped one of his three oxygen tanks to Robin's back. \"I\nhope this will work well enough to keep you breathing until we reach\nthe rocket. Fortunately you made your helmet deep enough to come down\nfar over your shoulders. I can work this air tube up high enough for\nyou to grasp the end in your mouth. The air will force its way into\nyour lungs. You'll have to struggle to force your exhalation out of\nyour nose. It's difficult, especially the first time, but you'll have\nto cope with it.\"\n\nAs he held the helmet preparatory to putting it over Robin's head,\nhe gave him some last-minute instructions. \"We won't be able to\ncommunicate once I get this on you. You've no radio and your mouth will\nbe full anyway. So listen carefully.\n\n\"The rocket is about a hundred yards away. I'll lead the way, and I'll\ntie this cord around your waist so you won't lose me. Follow me as\nclose as you can. There's a possibility that your glass plate may fog\nup or ice over from the water vapor inside your helmet. If it does,\nhang on to the cord and keep moving after me! But don't stop ... and\ndon't give up! All set?\"\n\nRobin's heart was beating fast, he felt strange and stifled in his\nbindings. This was the zero instant. He nodded, held out his hand.\nPeter grasped it, shook it. \"When you're all set, follow me across the\nwind stream. It's powerful--don't let it throw you.\"\n\nRobin put the end of the air tube in his mouth. Peter pushed the\nhomemade helmet down over his head, secured it tightly, almost\npainfully, until no space was left for air to escape. Then Peter\nreached behind Robin to the small tank strapped there and turned a\npetcock.\n\nInstantly Robin started to choke as he felt something being rammed down\nhis lungs. He caught himself, recognizing that his lungs were being\nforcibly inflated. He struggled to get control of his diaphragm to\nexpel the excess air pressure. He managed finally to do so, feeling a\nwhiff of air rush through his nostrils. He fought a bit more with the\nunpleasant current, felt himself getting a grip on it.\n\nThrough the plate of his helmet he saw Peter watching him anxiously.\nThen Peter rapidly tied the nylon cord around his own waist, let it out\na few feet, and tied the other end around Robin's. Peter snapped shut\nthe visor of his own helmet, touched the air controls of his own suit,\nand nodding to Robin, stepped out into the tunnel.\n\nRobin followed closely, conscious of the tight, restricting bands,\nstill fighting the unpleasant pressure of the air tube blowing down\nhis lungs. Peter walked a few steps, pointed a gloved hand across the\npassage, shone his light.\n\nThere was a narrow black gap across there. Through it Robin caught a\nglimpse of bright white specks--the stars!\n\nThen Peter made a dash, seemed to be picked up by a giant hand and\nwhirled wildly across the passage. The cord tightened and Robin jumped\ninto the space to avoid being pulled off his feet.\n\nHe was struck at once by a terrific onrush. A hot, violent blast\nslammed into him. He lost his footing, felt himself being hurled\nheadlong into a furious tornado. The cord leaped out, and Peter pulled\non it hard. Robin swung about, fetched up against the other side of the\nwall of the cave with a bang, was pulled to his feet before he had even\nstarted to fall, and was propelled right through the gap in the wall.\n\nSuddenly all was still. The whistling of the wind, the roar of the\ncurrent as it struck him, had vanished. Only the sucking and rushing of\nthe oxygen in his own helmet could be heard. He was outside, on the\nsurface of the Moon at last!\n\nThe gap opened from the wall of a cliff. Above him, the cliff soared\nto become a mountainous edge of a deep, wide crater. He turned his\nhead, but Peter was impatient. He felt the pull of the cord, turned\nand followed Peter, who was moving away from the crater wall in long,\nlow strides, strides that ate up distance like an Earthly giant in\nseven-league boots. Robin adjusted his pace, followed closely.\n\nFor a while he forgot his personal danger and simply gazed around at\nthe fabulous moonscape. The crater's other wall was maybe a dozen\nmiles away, but the thin air--the almost indetectably tenuous air that\nclustered at the bottom of this crater made the distance seem nothing.\nHe could even make out details of the far edge.\n\nAnd yet this section of the Moon was in the night-time. The sun had\npassed it by. It should have been dark, pitch-dark, by the logic of the\ninterplanetary space. Yet it wasn't. Everything instead was bathed in\na cold greenish-blue light that covered the surface like the glow of a\nhalf-dozen full moons.\n\nHe looked up. Directly in the center of the sky overhead was the source\nof the radiation. A great glowing ball of green and blue and white,\na ball with a misty aura surrounding it, a globe that struck Robin\ninstantly as familiar. It was the Earth. The home world, seen in all\nits glory, a giant full-moon Earth, continents and islands clearly\noutlined, a glory of pale colors, poles agleam with dazzling\nwhite ... it was a sight that momentarily stopped Robin in his tracks,\nhypnotized with wonder.\n\nThe cord pulled him out of it, and on he dashed, looking about him in\nthe pale Earthlight.\n\nThe surface was thick with cosmic dust, here and there the rounded\ndomelike surface of a congealed volcanic bubble. Cracks crossed and\ncrisscrossed the surface, and Peter and he had to bound across many of\nthem. He saw rising slightly above the surface a long rill of whitish\nsubstance, racing across the crater bottom. With a start he realized\nthat that must be the glasslike roof of the great cleft he had so\nrecently escaped from.\n\nAbove, the sky was nearly black and myriad stars shone bright from the\ndistance. The outlines of the surrounding mountains walled in the two\nboys as if they were pygmy boxers in a gargantuan ring.\n\nRobin was forcing the air from his nostrils, allowing the oxygen to\nrush into his lungs. He began now to feel the first faint chill of\nsurrounding space. He realized that it must already be nearly a hundred\nand fifty below zero on the surface, probably even much more than that.\nHe had to keep moving, keep moving.\n\nBut it was getting colder. He felt the cold penetrate him as his suit\nradiated the warmth that was in it. Now he wondered what was happening\noutside. Something was obscuring his view. Was it mist he was passing\nthrough?\n\nHe had heard of mist on the Moon's surface, but he had seen none when\nhe had first emerged. Yet his vision was being obscured more and more\nby a cloudiness. He strained his eyes, suddenly realized that the mist\nwas not outside, it was inside! The slight amount of vapor inside his\nhelmet was beginning to frost up on the inside of his face plate. What\nPeter had feared was beginning to happen.\n\nRobin missed his footing, stumbled, not having seen the little ridge\nthey had passed. Peter, now barely visible ahead of him, had not\nstopped. Robin felt the cord tighten as he slowed down, uncertain of\nwhere his feet were landing.\n\nHe began to feel groggy, realized that he was becoming frightened. He\ngritted his teeth on the unpleasant air tube, said to himself, _Get a\nhold on, stay firm. Only a few more steps to go. Hang on! Hang on!_\n\nHe conquered his panic. Blind or not, he would keep on until he passed\nout. The face plate was now solid white, completely opaque. He stumbled\non, allowing the tight cord to direct him, pull him.\n\nOn and on, the journey seemed endless. Running, jumping, and bouncing,\nhis feet banging against unseen rocks, hitting into cracks, kicking\nout, flying through space in bounds of blind horror. It was a nightmare\nsuch as he'd never dreamed.\n\nThen, as he came down hard and banged into something, he felt his\nhelmet slip a little, jog slightly. There was a _whish_ and suddenly\nhis face plate cleared completely. At the same instant he felt as if\nhis eyes would pop, while something snatched at his nose and sucked the\nbreath from him.\n\nThrough the clear plate he caught a wild glimpse of a large metallic\nstructure sticking up out of the ground. The Russian rocket, he thought\nwildly. It was big like a huge bullet, gleaming brightly and polished.\nHe saw it nearing him, realized he was being dragged along by Peter.\n\nHe realized also that his helmet had slipped a gap, that the air within\nhad been sucked out, that the water vapor clogging his face plate had\nbeen snatched out with it, and that his face was exposed. But the\noxygen tube was still in his mouth, still forcing air into him, and his\nnostrils were having it sucked out almost as fast. Somehow the thin\nstream of air rushing from the helmet kept his face from all the rigors\nof vacuum. His eyes were bulging and paining, he felt his nose spraying\nblood and a red film kept clogging the face plate and being snatched\naway by the escaping air.\n\nThen as he realized he could no longer stand the agony, he felt himself\ngrabbed under the shoulders, hoisted up, shoved into a small dark space\nand felt through his fingers the clang of a metal door. There came a\nhissing noise, and as consciousness at last oozed away from him, he\nknew that they had reached the air lock of the Soviet rocket and that\nhis ordeal was over.\n\n\n\n\n_17. Moon Calling Earth_\n\n\nThe impression of a damp cloth moving gently over his face was Robin's\nfirst sensation on recovering his senses. He opened his eyes to find\nPeter leaning over him, carefully mopping away the soreness from his\nnose and face. Robin's eyes hurt and he blinked several times, each\ntime feeling their rawness.\n\n\"Easy does it,\" said Peter, smiling. \"Your eyes are very bloodshot, but\nfortunately there's no real damage. You couldn't have been exposed to\nthe outside for more than a few seconds. Nosebleed's stopped, too.\"\n\nRobin raised his head, feeling a little dizzy and weak at first. He\nwas lying in a hammock slung across the narrow space of the rocket's\ntiny cabin. He took in the limited quarters slowly, while flexing his\nmuscles to discover other points of sensitivity. His clothing had been\nremoved, the tight bandaging unwrapped. He was wearing some sort of\nloose aviation coverall that his brother had dressed him in.\n\n\"Have I been out long?\" Robin asked, rising to a sitting position.\n\n\"Maybe a half-hour,\" said his brother. \"Mostly shock and overexertion,\nI guess. You've got some bruises on your shins and feet, but nothing\nthat should stop you. Feel like some hot food? Real Earth food?\"\n\nRobin was suddenly hungry and the memories of a hundred forgotten foods\nflooded his senses. He nodded, and greedily attacked the full mess kit\nthat his brother had been heating. It contained merely some sort of\nfrankfurter, some canned potato, a chunk of black bread, and a cup of\nsomething that must have been condensed cabbage soup ... but to Robin\nit was the best banquet he'd had in many months. For the first time he\nate meat that wasn't rabbit or a Moon creature, vegetable that wasn't\nMoontree fruit. His tongue reveled in the flavors. A glass of hot tea\nwas the final sensation.\n\nRefreshed, he looked around. The little cabin, occupying the entire\nnose of the rocket, must have been a tight squeeze indeed for a\nthree-man crew. The controls and the pilot's seat occupied a good\nsection of it. There was space for only two hammocks, which were\nobviously not to be spread out except when taking off or sleeping, and\nPeter was rolling up the one in which Robin had been resting. There was\na built-in electric grid, a nozzle from which water was piped, a large\nnumber of observational and recording instruments, a couple of folding\nseats, nothing much else. Several thick glass bull's-eye windows were\nset in a circle around the nose, at a level with the pilot's eyes.\nLight came from one large electric bulb hanging in the nose of the\nship. The whole cabin was tilted over at an angle, the result of the\ncrash.\n\n\"I'm surprised that everything is in such good condition,\" said Robin.\n\"I had expected to see a complete ruin.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Peter, \"I've got to admit that Von Borck was definitely a\ngood pilot. The crash was probably not his fault. We were actually not\nsupposed to land. Our orders were to try to circle the Moon in a narrow\norbit, then return. We were to land only if Von Borck was sure he could\ndo it and get away again.\n\n\"What happened though was that after we had crossed the dividing line\nin space where the Moon's pull equaled the Earth's pull, our gyroscopic\ncontrols jammed. Von Borck couldn't turn the rockets in our rear to\nthe indicated direction. We struggled with the gyro for about forty\nminutes, even going outside to get at the airless tube section beneath\nthis sealed cabin. When we finally got the controls operating, it was\nfar too late to attempt to establish an orbit. Instead, Von Borck\ndid the next best thing--he decided to attempt a direct landing. He\nreversed the rocket entirely, slowed us down and came down in an\neffort to land on his jets. It's a very difficult balancing trick,\nespecially on an unknown landing field with uncertain distances.\n\n\"Actually he almost succeeded. He came down just a little too\nfast, smashed up our tubes, rammed the whole rear down into the\npumice-and-dust surface, leaving our nose cabin sticking out unharmed.\nVon Borck slammed his head against the metal paneling. I took a spill,\nand Arkady who had volunteered to stand at the opposite observation\nport from the pilot in order to inform him of any dangers from that\nside was thrown across the room and killed.\"\n\nRobin nodded slowly. \"But why didn't you just stay here instead of\ngoing out?\"\n\nPeter went to a wall cabin, opened it. Inside there were about a\nhalf-dozen small containers and cans. \"That's the whole stock of food\nwe have left,\" was the reply. \"We couldn't have stayed here too long.\nWhen I looked around outside I saw mist issuing from that spot in the\ncliff we came through. Obviously we'd die if we didn't find some place\nto stay. I went outside, buried Arkady, explored a little, realized\nthat that rill out there was a sealed cleft which probably held air. So\nI loaded Von Borck, who had been unconscious for hours, and set out to\ngo underground.\"\n\nRobin got up, walked around. He was already in better shape. He looked\nat the panels, found them complex and with the markings in Russian.\n\"What's the source of the electricity?\" he asked.\n\n\"There's an atomic pile somewhere in the rear of the rocket,\"\nPeter replied. \"That's something you don't smash easily. It's still\noperating.\"\n\n\"Can we send a message back to Earth then?\" asked Robin. \"If we've the\npower, and this ship must have a radio....\"\n\n\"We tried that, but the radio was smashed in the landing. However,\nthere is an emergency wave sender which was designed for just such a\nthing. I don't know if that's working. Let's see.\"\n\nPeter opened a door set in the floor of the rocket which opened on an\narea jammed with equipment, wiring, and extra supplies. He reached\naround, extracted a small black box. He held it up, shook it gently.\nHanding it to Robin, he took out a roll of wire, and seating himself at\nthe pilot's seat began to connect the box to the rocket. When it was\nplugged in to the electric system of the cabin, Peter flicked a switch\nand turned a knob. A thin humming came from the box.\n\n\"It works,\" he said. \"This gives off a steady signal wave going on the\ngeneral air-travel band. The radio buzz can be heard from Earth if it's\nbeing sought. By following it, astronomers can trace exactly where this\nrocket is. All we have to do is leave this on--it will run for years on\nour atomic power source. Eventually, rockets will locate us.\"\n\n\"But surely there must be some way of calling their attention even\nsooner?\" said Robin. \"Do you have flares?\"\n\n\"You're right,\" Peter said excitedly. \"We've got them. And it is night\noutside. If we use our flares, they could be seen on any decent-sized\ntelescope. Shall we set them off?\"\n\nRobin nodded. \"No time like now.\"\n\nPeter reached again into the floor storages, opening another section,\nand began to pull out another space suit. \"This was Arkady's,\" he said.\n\"It should fit you.\"\n\nIt did. This time, Robin felt none of the uneasiness that had assailed\nhim on his previous experience on the outside. In a few minutes, he and\nPeter were standing a short distance away from the rocket and setting\nout the flares.\n\nAlthough the suit was cumbersome, it was not too uncomfortable. Instead\nof tight bandaging, the fabric of the suit consisted of some sort of\nself-inflating air sacs, which maintained an equal and natural pressure\non the surface of Robin's body. The helmet, which was really airtight\nand warmed, was entirely comfortable, although again the breathing was\na matter of a forced intake and a willful exhalation.\n\nThey set up the flares, which were magnesium-burning giant candles, a\nsafe distance from the rocket, wired them to a detonator powered from\nthe ship. Then, before going back, Robin and Peter simply stood and\nlooked around.\n\nAll about, the giant bare mountains ringed the crater. Their gaunt,\njagged outlines were a black ring against which was set the star-strewn\nwonder of the sky, in whose exact center slowly rotated the marvelous\nglobe of Mother Earth.\n\nThe eerie Earthlight threw odd shadows and dark spots across the\ngrayness of the plain. Here and there the mysterious-looking domes\nrose, the tops of bubbles as Robin had reason to know. In other places\nsmaller craters and ringed ridges broke the surface.\n\n\"It looks desolate and barren,\" commented Peter on the helmet-radio.\n\"Yet, you know, when we landed in the sunlight of the Moon's day, it\nwasn't all like this. There were patches of low scrubby plants growing\nin the lowest sections near spots where some air must have been seeping\nout. This crater is considerably lower than much of the surrounding\nareas on this central part of the Moon. The air here may be almost\nunnoticeable, but it is still just a bit denser even than it must be on\nthe 'seas' beyond these crater walls.\"\n\n\"How did you spot that break in the wall we came through?\" asked Robin,\nturning to search for it.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, it was quite obvious,\" said his brother. \"In the\nsunlight, there's a distinct stream of vapor coming out of it and a lot\nof frozen water vapor all around. Further, it was just there that the\ngreen vegetation was growing thickest. It was quite inviting to a man\nlooking for refuge ... otherwise I'd probably never have thought of it.\"\n\nThey trudged back to the rocket, climbed through the lock into the\nsafety of the tiny cabin. Robin set the firing pin of the detonator\nswitch, looked out. \"It's the Western Hemisphere that's facing the Moon\nnow,\" he said. \"Just coming into view. Must be early morning around the\nNew Mexico belt. You know, your Russian friends won't see this flare.\"\n\nPeter looked up, shrugged. \"We can fire another flare twelve hours\nlater,\" he said. \"I am not particular who rescues us. I am an American,\nyou know. I owe something to the Soviets too. When you look at the\nworld from here, from another planet, these distinctions of nationality\nseem so--somehow--unimportant. We are all humans, all from the same\nancestors. Even if we were not brothers, we would feel ourselves such.\nOur roots go to all parts of the world. If you add up all people's\nancestors a hundred generations back, you will realize that there can't\nbe anyone who is not distantly related to everyone else--that we all\nshare somebody in our ancestry who lived in every country of the world,\nshared all the histories of the past and all the different politics and\nopinions.\"\n\nPeter grew quiet, as if a little amazed at his own outburst. Robin drew\nclose to him, threw an arm around him. \"I think when more men get out\namong the stars, people are going to realize that we can't afford to\nthink of ourselves as anything other than citizens of Mother Earth.\nIn the face of the universe, of Moonmen, of the inhabitants of the\nmillions of other planets that must exist, our national differences\nseem so small, so much a private family matter as not to be thrashed\nout in the public of our interstellar neighbors. I think it's good we\nare brothers. All men are brothers.\"\n\nRobin threw the switch.\n\nOutside, the crater suddenly lighted up in a blinding white glare,\na blaze that threw wild, dancing black shadows several miles across\nthe floor, that momentarily lighted the great crags and precipices\nof the mountains, that made an outburst of grandeur in a moonscape of\nunearthly terror and beauty.\n\nFive minutes later, when the flares had died down, Robin again threw\nthe switch. The second set of magnesium bombs went off and again the\ncrater was brilliantly lighted.\n\n\"On Earth that should stand out very sharply. It is nearly a new moon\nfor them. This spot of light will be like a blinding diamond on a black\nvelvet setting,\" said Peter poetically.\n\nThey rested now, taking their space suits off, lolling around on two\nhammocks, just talking, renewing acquaintance, exchanging experiences.\nThey ate another meal, slept, finally donned their outfits again and\nset off the next set of flares a half Earth-day later, when the massive\narea of Eurasia was on the face of the globe in the Lunar sky.\n\n\"Now the Russian observers have had a chance to see us,\" said Peter.\n\"We ought to go back to the underground world again. Our supplies here\nare not enough. In order to eat and breathe the next few months, we\nwill have to live among the Glassies. We have to go back to the great\ncleft again.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Robin. \"And that brings up the question of Von Borck. He'll\nbe waiting for us, you know.\"\n\nHis brother nodded. \"Ah, but this time we will be the ones who are\narmed and ready.\" He reached down, took out a second gun belt, handed\nit to Robin. \"Use this. Strap it around your space suit.\"\n\nRobin looked at it, lifted the pistol in its holster. \"It's an army\nautomatic,\" said Peter. \"A Tokarev .30, built much the same as an\nAmerican Colt. Here, I'll show you how it works.\"\n\nHe cautioned about the lack of a safety catch, showed how to load the\nclip of bullets. \"Be careful of it, though. It has a strong kickback on\nEarth--here on the Moon, it may be quite tricky to fire a gun.\"\n\nThey dressed again in their outfits, loaded on other supplies that\nmight come in handy, including a light carbine, hunting knife and axe,\nand waterproof pack of matches. They slung the gun belts around their\nwaists, tied the nylon cord to each other as an added precaution, and\nmade a last check of the rocket cabin.\n\nThe little radio signal was still humming. Some day it would bring a\nrescue ship. Whether that would be a matter of months or a matter of\nyears was the only question. Robin gulped a bit at the prospect of\nspending more years away from his own world. Sight of Earth, the taste\nof real food had made him quite homesick.\n\nHe thrust such thoughts away, snapped tight his helmet plate, and\nnodded to Peter. They climbed out of the rocket, sealing the air-lock\ndoor. They stood for a moment outside the wreck, taking their bearings.\n\nThey turned to head for the cliff wall, when something went _ping_\noff a metal fixture on Robin's helmet. He started, pulled back and\nsomething seemed to flick past his eyes and pop against the side of the\nrocket.\n\nHe yelled and ducked for cover. \"Look out, Peter! Get down!\"\n\nStanding on the surface, just outside the narrow crack that led\nunderground, was the figure of a man--a man wearing a space suit\nsimilar to theirs, with a small dark object in his hand which issued a\nlittle flash of red fire.\n\n\"It's Von Borck,\" gasped Robin, \"and he's shooting at us!\"\n\n\n\n\n_18. Madman's Battle_\n\n\nRobin lay flat against the ground, holding himself motionless. Peter's\nvoice came over his helmet-radio. \"Did you get hit?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Robin. \"Something may have chipped my helmet but there's no\nleak, so I guess it wasn't a direct shot. How about you? Where are you?\"\n\nFrom his position he couldn't see his brother, who had obviously fallen\nsomewhere near. \"I'm down just behind you,\" came Peter's voice. \"We'll\nhave to find better cover than this. There's a slight ridge about a\nfoot high a couple of yards to your left. Crawl over to it and get\nbehind it.\"\n\nRobin cautiously raised his head. It drew no fire and he realized that\nlying down in the darkness of the gray surface, the greenish Earthlight\nwas not sufficient to outline him to Von Borck's eyes. He eased up on\nhis arms and crawled slowly to the ridge. Behind this was a measure of\nprotection. He was now free to twist his body around to look for Peter.\nIn the cumbersome helmet and suit, the only way he could look around\nwas to move his whole body.\n\nPeter was crawling after him slowly. There was a sudden spurt of dust\nfrom the ground just behind him, like a tiny geyser. \"Von's still\nshooting at you,\" said Robin. \"Hurry!\"\n\nPeter slid quickly into refuge behind the ridge at Robin's side.\nTwisting his body, he unstrapped the light carbine rifle from his back,\nbrought it around in front of him. \"Have you ever fired a rifle or a\npistol, Robin?\" he asked.\n\n\"I learned some target shooting at school,\" said Robin. \"I was a pretty\nfair shot. But I never handled a revolver.\"\n\nPeter slid the rifle over to him. \"Then you use this. I'll use my\npistol. We'll have to get him before he gets us.\"\n\nRobin held the rifle awkwardly. He glanced at it, saw that it was\nloaded, slid the bolt action. \"I don't like this,\" he said. \"If there\nwas only some way we could capture him and hold him until we're\nrescued. You said he's a good man with rockets. Maybe he can be\nstraightened out mentally if we can get him back to Earth.\"\n\nPeter shrugged, grunted. \"Don't waste time dreaming. Sure he was a good\nengineer. But right now it's him or us. If he has his way, none of us\nwill ever return to Earth alive. Just remember he's doing his very best\nto kill us--we cannot dare do any less. Sure, if we get a break, we'll\ncapture him. Right now, though, we'd better shoot him or we'll never\nget out of this alive.\"\n\nPeter suited his action to his words. He clumsily forced his thickly\ngloved finger through the trigger guard and grasped the pistol. He\nswiftly raised up, aimed, and pulled the trigger.\n\nThere was a flash of red and simultaneously Peter fell over backward\nand rolled over once with a yell of pain. Robin turned, stricken with\nhorror. \"What happened! Are you hit?\"\n\nPeter's voice came back. \"No, I'm not hit, but I almost wrenched my\narm off! It was the gun's recoil, the kick! I completely forgot what\na terribly strong recoil a pistol would have on the Moon. It was like\nholding a rocket engine in my hand for a split second. It simply hurled\nme right over.\"\n\nPeter rolled himself over on his chest, resuming his position next to\nRobin. \"We'll have to be careful when we fire. Remember the kick will\nbe many times stronger than back on Earth.\"\n\nThere was another spurt of dust to one side of them. Another evidence\nof Von Borck's shooting. Possibly he had caught a glimpse of Peter's\nscramble.\n\nRobin slid the rifle out in front of him, cocked it for firing. He\ncrawled to a break in the ridge, propped the butt of the gun against a\nsmall outcropping of rock along the surface, rolled himself clumsily\ninto position. Raising his head, he saw the figure of Von Borck still\nstanding against the narrow entrance to the wall. He aimed the rifle as\nwell as he was able under the handicaps, pressed it hard, and pulled\nthe trigger.\n\nHe felt a sharp shock as the rifle tried to kick out of his hands,\nbut he had bolstered it well. He saw a chunk of rock split from the\ncliffside just over the German's head. Von Borck ducked as the dust\nbegan to fall upon him in its slow Lunar fashion, then the German moved\nback into the break.\n\nRobin again aimed the rifle, this time directly at the dark center of\nthe break in the cliff. Again he fired. This time the figure of the\nspace-suited man backed out of sight entirely.\n\n\"What now?\" asked Robin. \"Shall we wait for him to come back or shall\nwe try to follow him?\"\n\n\"Better take the chance and go after him,\" said his brother's voice.\n\"Must follow up every advantage.\"\n\n\"Then let's go,\" said Robin and leaped to his feet. Peter jumped up\nwith him and they both started to sprint for the entrance in the cliff.\n\nThey ran for it in low, swift leaps, and this time Robin saw what ease\nand fun running on the Moon's surface could be if you had the proper\noutfit for it. It was so light and easy, like running in a dream,\ngliding rapidly over the faintly lighted eerie moonscape in a world of\nabsolute silence and motionlessness.\n\nFor an instant, as they closed in on the cliff, Robin saw Von Borck's\nfigure appear, there was another flash of red and then the man vanished\nagain. But the boys did not halt. Together they charged the entrance.\nIn a matter of seconds, they reached it, blocked it.\n\nThere was no sign of the German. They shone their flashlamps into the\nchannel behind the opening. There was nothing.\n\nRobin could feel the faint rustling movement of the rushing air\ncurrent, but he could see nothing in motion. Again he was struck by the\nweirdness of the phenomenon.\n\n\"Where'd he go?\" he whispered, even though his voice could not be heard\noutside of their helmets.\n\n\"He's probably hiding somewhere. We'll have to follow him. Get ready\nand then remember to throw yourself hard across that air blast. It's\nstrong.\" Peter checked the nylon that tied them together. \"Shall I\nuntie this or shall we jump together?\"\n\n\"Let's go together,\" said Robin. They held hands, and, backing up, took\na running start and threw themselves into the darkness of the break.\n\nThere was again the buffeting of a powerful wind, and Robin felt\nhimself being caught off his feet by the force of a hurricane. Before\nhe could be swept away, a jerk at the cord around his waist threw him\ndown, and he rolled over on the windless far side of the tunnel, safe\nwith Peter.\n\nHe became aware of outside noises. He followed Peter's example and\nopened the plate of his helmet. For an instant he gasped for air, then\nadjusted to the thin atmosphere.\n\nBoth brothers listened. But they heard nothing. \"He must have headed\nback for the cleft,\" said Peter. \"We'll have to follow him.\"\n\nThey started to retrace their tracks. Partly down the wind tunnel they\nfound the downward slope on which they had traveled before. Robin\nflashed his lamp down its steep pitch. He saw nothing. Gingerly he\nbegan to work his way cautiously down the sharp slope.\n\nPeter followed behind. Halfway down, Robin stopped for breath. When he\ncaught it, he whispered, \"I just thought of something. How do we know\nVon went down here? Maybe he's gone farther up the tunnel, waiting to\nslip back and get behind us.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" said Peter. \"I looked in the dust up along the\ntunnel for his footprints and saw none. He must be ahead of us.\"\n\nThey slid on down the slope, found themselves at the beginning of the\nupper series of connected broken bubbles. Along this they trekked,\npassing along the debris-strewn floor, picking their way carefully.\nShining their lamps ahead as they went, they saw no sign of motion.\n\nFinally they came to the hole in the floor, through which they would\nhave to drop several feet into the cave below. Robin switched off his\nlight as they approached it, whispered to Peter to do the same.\n\nThey stood silently in the pitch darkness. Then Robin nudged Peter,\npointed with his hand against Peter's. The hole in the floor was\nfaintly visible. There was a dim flickering coming from it. Robin\nwhispered, \"It must be Von's flashlamp. He's down there, waiting for\nus.\"\n\nPeter nodded in the darkness. \"It was the logical spot. He probably\nhopes to shoot us as we drop through the hole.\"\n\nThe two stepped carefully up to the hole, not yet using their lights.\nThey kneeled down, looked.\n\nThe cave below was almost dark. But from just outside it, from the\ntunnel that led into it, was a flickering light. Their crazed enemy was\nlurking there, waiting.\n\n\"What do we do now?\" muttered Peter.\n\nRobin looked carefully. \"I think I have it. Untie the cord and give it\nto me.\"\n\nPeter untied his end of the nylon rope that linked them. Robin undid\nhis end, took his flashlamp, tied it to the cord. He whispered his plan\nto Peter.\n\nRobin lit the flash, backed away from the hole several feet, and then\nkicked some rocks and began to make a clattering noise. At the same\ntime he began to talk loudly, as if conversing with Peter.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter was crouched at the edge of the hole, his Tokarev\nautomatic firmly wedged against one side of the hole while it was\npointing directly at the faint spot of light below which Von Borck was\nhiding.\n\nRobin reached the hole, making sure he was creating enough noise for\nthe rocket pilot to hear him. Then he waved his lamp a few times,\nflickering it around the cave below, and kneeling down, began to lower\nit on the cord, trying to keep its beam pointed at the tunnel in which\ntheir foe waited. This was the bait on their trap.\n\nJust as he had expected, as the swinging lamp was about halfway down,\ndangling presumably in the helpless hand of a man being lowered to the\nfloor--as Von Borck was supposed to think--the figure of the German\nappeared in the cave, uttering a wild yell of triumph and aiming a big\npistol at the moving light.\n\nTwo guns went off at the same instant. There were two flashes of\nfire, two deafening blasts of sound. Von Borck's bullet shattered the\nswinging flashlamp, blew it into a dozen fragments.\n\nPeter's bullet struck Von Borck in the chest, hurling him against the\nwall to fall in a heap on the floor.\n\nWithout wasting time, Peter simply stepped into the hole and drifted\ndownward in the low force of Moon gravity. Robin followed suit. They\nleaned over the German's body.\n\nRobin looked at the pale, mustached face, the staring eyes. \"I think\nhe's dead,\" he said. \"Though he could be only unconscious.\" He reached\nover, started to feel the man's face to find out whether he still\nbreathed.\n\n\"Look out!\" shouted Peter suddenly and grabbed Robin, pulling him to\none side. Robin looked up and back.\n\nAbove him, with maddening leisureliness, the entire ceiling of the\nunderground bubble was dropping down, dropping in several giant chunks,\nseveral Earth tons of rock falling toward them.\n\nWith a mad scramble the two leaped to safety in the tunnel leading\ndownward. There was a slow grinding crash as the shattered roof of the\ncave settled to the floor, crushing the body beneath it, blocking and\nsealing the tunnel.\n\n\"Come on!\" Peter grabbed Robin's arm. \"The rest of it is caving in!\nWe'd better run!\"\n\nThey dashed down the tunnel, as it crashed behind them. On they ran,\nfollowing the twisted trail through fault and cleft and bubble, with\ndisaster following their steps. Finally the ruin and destruction came\nto an end as they reached the last steep slope downward to the great\nsealed cleft.\n\n\"What happened?\" asked Robin, as they paused at last to catch their\nbreath.\n\n\"The explosions!\" gasped Peter. \"The concussions of our pistols\nshattered the delicate balance of the honeycomb undersurface here.\nWe're lucky it didn't all come down at once, rather than in the form of\na chain reaction. We're lucky to be alive, believe me!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Robin, beginning to make his way down the last tunnel that\nled to the open ledge of the great bubble-world where the Glassies\nlived. \"Yes, we're lucky to be alive, but how will we ever get back to\nthe surface now? We're sealed in. Maybe forever.\"\n\nPeter was silent as they reached the ledge, looked into the vastness\nof the cleft-world, saw the faint flickering lights of Moonworm and\nMoonman. \"Maybe we'll never get out. Robinson Crusoe lived twenty-eight\nyears on his island before he was rescued. It may be fifty before they\nfind us in here.\"\n\nRobin shrugged. \"When I first landed here, I said to myself that while\nthere's life there's hope. Now there are two of us. And that's an\nadvance....\"\n\n\n\n\n_19. Riding the Tornado_\n\n\nThey looked down from their point on the high ledge into the length\nof the cleft-world. A very faint light streak could be seen looking\nupward--this was the curious volcanic glass of the surface roof.\nThrough it penetrated just a hint of the full Earthlight that bathed\nthe outer moonscape. Down were shadows and darkness, in the distance\nlittle bits of moving lights, flickering sparks, that may have been the\nGlassies' head-stalks.\n\nThe two men used their remaining flashlamp to light up the narrow\nledge. Carefully they made their way down the steep side of the cavern\nwall, their light swinging slowly back and forth. \"Suppose the Glassies\nsee the light?\" said Peter. \"We may be in for trouble.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Robin, \"but this time we'll be alert for it. We'll have\nto steer clear of overhanging spots, keep our light swinging about, but\nI have an idea we'll have no trouble. That bomb and the shooting will\nprobably make them keep their distance.\"\n\nDown they went until they reached the level surface. Then they started\noff across the space to the faraway place where the lights could be\nseen. It was the winter half-month now for the sublunar world. The Moon\ngrowths had fallen, shriveled, died. Their seeds lay dormant for the\nnext sun period. It was fairly chilly in the cavern, yet not as cold as\nit might have been. Somewhere, thought Robin, there is a warm volcanic\ncurrent keeping this cavern from freezing over.\n\nThey kept a good distance between each other, the long, thin, strong\ncord linking them being kept almost taut. The reasoning behind this\nwas that if another lassoing attempt were made, it would be almost\nimpossible to get both at once. As long as one were free to get at his\nfirearms, they could overcome such an attack.\n\nOn they went, with still no sign of meeting any opposition. Then Robin\nsaw a sudden faint flicker in a clump of darkness to one side. He\nstopped, whispered into his helmet-radio what he had seen. Rapidly\nhis eyes swept the scene, and, yes, there was another suddenly doused\nflicker on the other side. The Glassies must be watching them, waiting.\n\nNow the two proceeded at a slow pace, widely swinging their light from\nside to side to prevent ambush. \"Somehow,\" said Robin, \"we are going to\nhave to prove we're friendly. We may have to live here a long time.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Peter, \"but how?\"\n\nThey walked only a few steps farther before the answer was given them.\nSomething was standing directly in their path. As their light swung\nnear it, this figure raised two hands high and its head-stalk light\nflashed into brilliant prominence.\n\nIt was a Glassie standing there, a transparent-bodied Moonman whose odd\nface bore the equivalent of a broad smile and whose chest was decorated\nwith a painted black circle. Robin stared at the figure of this chief a\nmoment. He saw something move on the Glassie's shoulder--a tiny, dark,\nmanlike creature no bigger than a doll.\n\nThis creature opened its mouth, uttered a sharp shriek. \"Cheeky!\"\ngasped Robin. And at the sound of his voice the little monkey leaped\nfrom the Glassie's shoulder in one monstrous Lunar bound and arrived at\nRobin's foot. Another jump and it was in Robin's arms, screeching with\njoy.\n\nThe Glassie chief came forward. It spoke, \"Robin! Good see you. Good\nsee you.\" It was Korree! Now he too moved forward to grasp Robin\nawkwardly but happily ... Korree wearing the marking of the tribal head!\n\nNow other Glassies appeared around them, but they held no weapons\nin their hands, no sticky hoops or bindings. They stood around the\nnewcomers with awe and uncertainty--willing to be guided by Korree's\nactions but aware of the possible results of an encounter with\nspace-suited Earthlings.\n\nKorree turned a moment, waved them on, speaking in their tongue. Peter\ncame up, nodding, shoving his pistol back into its holster.\n\n\"I see your two friends have won the day while we were up above,\" he\nsaid. \"They were indeed friends.\"\n\nThe two brothers were escorted back to the site of the native\nsettlement in a crowd of bobbing head-stalk lights and jabbering\nGlassies. Korree explained as they walked.\n\nIt seemed that the explosion of the homemade bomb had completely\ndisrupted the fear in which Von Borck had held the Glassies.\nThis was greater magic to them, and it was the mysterious little\nbeing--Cheeky--who had accomplished it. In the first excitement, the\nGlassies had fled and hid. That was when the German had come after\nPeter and Robin, leaving the Glassies behind.\n\nThis, too, was an indication that even the powerful stranger who had\nusurped the role of chief by the expedient of his mere existence and\nstrength had bowed to the power of the little monkey. In Moonman\ntribes, the chief never fled the scene of his authority. To do so was\nto abdicate it. Von Borck had unknowingly destroyed his authority by\nhis abrupt chase after Robin and Peter.\n\nWhen Korree made his way back to the cave-village after giving up his\nattempt to follow his Earthling friends, he had arrived to find the\nGlassies cowering in fear of the capering Cheeky, who was unhurt by the\nblast.\n\nKorree had gathered up Cheeky in his arms and by so doing had made\nhimself the master of the situation. That was how it came about that\nthe two brothers had been met by a friendly admiring reception rather\nthan a hostile one.\n\n\"But what happened when Von Borck returned here to get his space suit?\"\nasked Robin.\n\nKorree waved a hand as if the answer was obvious. \"Glassies hide,\"\nhe said simply. \"Korree hide. Cheeky hide. Everyone hide.\" And so\nVon Borck arrived to find himself deserted and unwelcome. And he had\npromptly left to follow the trail to the surface.\n\nOnce back at the site of the caves, they found themselves honored\nguests. In the days that followed, they set up a cave for themselves,\norganized a home. Cheeky seemed to have now attached himself to Korree\nand went everywhere with the Glassie. Robin and Peter rested, set up a\nregimen of native food, observed the Glassies' way of life.\n\nThe sun came up again on the surface and flooded the cleft with its\nlight. The Moontrees grew rapidly in dense profusion. The two brothers\ngradually explored the length and breadth of the little world,\nsystematically working around it in search of some new path upward.\n\nBut their search seemed fruitless. There were a number of holes and\nbreaks in the walls and caves, but none promised a place of exit to the\nsurface.\n\nThey went back to the original ledge and tunnel, tried to work their\nway in, but it was blocked with fallen stone and jammed too tightly for\npassage.\n\nThey discussed the possibility of making explosives, blasting through,\nbut discarded this as they realized the basic fragility of the whole\ncleft setup. Such blastings might do worse damage, might even crack\na direct opening to the surface through which the air within the\ncleft-bubble would rush out, leaving it a sterile, cold, and dead\nregion.\n\nFinally after another Lunar night and another Lunar day, exhausting\nstill one more Earth month, they settled down to a slow steady picking\nand shoveling. They worked in the blocked tunnel in all their spare\ntime, carefully picking away chips of rock, pushing others aside,\nburrowing around fallen slabs, slowly, gradually, painfully working\ntheir way along the old path. But it was hard and unrewarding work. It\nwent slowly and they were always afraid of a cave-in.\n\nTwo or three times such an event did occur, and had it not been for\nthe slowness with which things fell on the Moon, one or the other\nbrother would surely have been pinned down. On the third such disaster,\nthe two quit the task, returned to their home in the Glassie village\ndiscouraged.\n\n\"This will not work,\" said Robin. \"We'll have to give up this entire\napproach. It would be months or even years before we could make our\nentire way and by that time one of us would surely be killed in the\ntunnels. They are still highly unsettled, still shifting.\"\n\nThey sat down, looked at each other. \"There must still be a way,\" said\nPeter. \"We must find a way to reach the surface. Otherwise we will\nremain here forever.\"\n\nRobin nodded, deep in thought. Another night was coming over the cleft.\nThe sun was passing swiftly from overhead. A chill began to touch the\nair, as darkness blacked out the cavern. It would be another two weeks\nbefore they could resume any work on their problem. Robin started to\nbuild a fire in their cave, one they burned every Moon winter's night.\nAs he did so a thought struck him.\n\nHe turned. \"When we were first returning from the surface it occurred\nto me as we came out that there had to be some sort of volcanic current\nwarming this cavern, sun or no sun. Now it seems to me that if we could\nfind that current, we would find some sort of air stream or water\nstream, that must go upward. We ought to look for the warmest spot in\nthe cavern, trace it.\"\n\nPeter turned, a sharp light in his eye. \"And now that you say it, do\nyou know what that current is? It's the one that passes the break in\nthe crater wall--the constant hurricane that we broke through to get in\nhere, which rushes by the break so hard and so fast that it seals this\ncavern's quiet inner air as perfectly as if it were an air lock. It has\nto be that very current which passes somewhere lower down and warms\nthis cleft!\"\n\nRobin nodded, a sharp excitement stirring him. \"I think we have hit\non it. The night time is the time to hunt for it. Find the spot or\nplaces in this cleft that stay warmest and they must be nearest the\nunderground wind tunnel.\"\n\nSo they set out on a new course of exploration, this time scouting the\nbubble in the dark of the night. It grew chillier, but in their space\nsuits, which they had resumed for this expedition, they could keep\nwarm. They found several areas along the ground where it seemed a bit\nwarmer than in the cave generally, but after several days of search,\nthis clue also seemed fruitless. The areas were such that no amount of\ndigging short of high explosives would suffice.\n\nFinally when the long Lunar night was almost over, they awakened from\nsleep in the cave to face the thought that this too was a blind alley.\nKorree entered, the monkey on his shoulder. He made his way to them,\nnoticed their air of sadness, asked them why.\n\nTired, Robin explained to him what they were looking for. His Glassie\nfriend cocked his head. \"You come my home. I show you hot spot,\" he\nsaid.\n\nThe two men looked up. \"What?\" asked Peter. Korree repeated his\nstatement. Peter looked at Robin quizzically. Without another word the\ntwo got up and followed the Glassie.\n\nThe deep cave where the chief made his home was only a short distance\nfrom their own. Here, at the very back of the chief's home, they found\nwhat they sought. There was a thin, sharp crack in the rear wall. The\nstone around it was definitely warmer than that in the rest of the\ncave. Putting their ears to the crack, they could hear the faint high\nwhistling of the air current that must be roaring past only a foot or\ntwo beyond.\n\n\"This is why it was picked as the chief's cave,\" said Robin. \"It's\npractically air-conditioned!\"\n\nThe next day, after the sun had finally made its appearance, the two\nstarted to work in the back of Korree's cave. They worked carefully\nwith axe and pick, enlarging the crack, chipping away at it. Finally,\nthey dislodged a sizable segment of rock, enough to allow one man to\nsqueeze through.\n\nSure enough, there was a dark underground channel through whose center\nrushed the eternal current of hot volcanic air. This channel probably\nhad its source somewhere in the still-mysterious depths of the Moon's\ncore. It wound and forced its way upward doubtless to dissipate\nsomewhere, as the cold of the surface bore away its warmth, probably to\nwind up downward again as a mass of cold gas.\n\nThere was barely enough room at the side of the tunnel for a man to\nstand flat against the wall, without touching the blast.\n\nRobin, who had gone through to examine it, came back out into the light\nof Korree's cave. \"Well,\" he asked Peter, \"what do we do now?\"\n\nHis brother nodded. \"I think we can get to the surface all right. Just\nget in the blast and let ourselves be blown along upward. When we find\nthat break, we'll get out of the current and we'll be able to reach our\nrocket.\"\n\n\"Uh huh,\" said Robin, \"and then how do we get back down here again?\"\n\nPeter shrugged. \"I don't know. There must be a way.\"\n\nThe two returned to their own place and talked it over. But the\nopportunity was too good to pass up. \"Sooner or later,\" said Robin,\n\"we're going to do it. So we may as well face that. As for getting\nback, perhaps we could simply walk all the way down the channel,\nkeeping carefully to the side of dead air just beyond the blast.\"\n\nPeter frowned. \"I don't think you'll find much of that. There can't be\nmany places where such a dead air channel exists. On the other hand,\nif we attack the problem of returning by the old route, we may be able\nto find a way through it from that end--or make a new one. Back at the\nrocket there are explosives, better tools than those we have. I think\nwe should risk it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Robin added, \"I think so too. Besides, we ought to fire off some\nmore flares. Our signals may never have been seen.\"\n\nThat being settled, the two Earthlings again donned their space suits,\nequipped themselves, tied themselves together with a length of cord.\nThey returned to Korree's cave, explained their project and gravely\nshook hands with their Glassie friend.\n\nThen Robin carefully eased himself through the break into the dark\nchannel. Peter squeezed through after him, as Robin flattened himself\nalong the wall and moved aside. Their helmets sealed, Robin counted to\nthree, and then both leaped forward.\n\nInstantly the racing wind current caught them up, snatched them off\ntheir feet. They found themselves being blown madly along the darkness\nlike leaves before a gale.\n\nThe air was hot and Robin felt himself almost scorched as he was hurled\nalong, his elbows and legs occasionally scraping the wall, once feeling\nhimself somersaulting upward, twisting and turning in the horrible\nblast.\n\nFor a dreadful moment he felt panicky, out of control, utterly helpless\nin the grip of the underground tornado. He lighted the flash, saw it\nwildly flickering. He drew his legs up, ducked his head, and found he\ncould get his equilibrium. Ahead of him the tunnel was ascending. He\nfelt himself rising, felt the slight drag occasionally at his belt as\nPeter's bouncing body followed his.\n\nNow the air began to cool and seemed to slow down slightly. The passage\nleveled off, he was whirling down a straight passage, and suddenly, in\na split second of awareness, he saw a faint spot of bright light ahead\nof him. He rushed toward it, like a ball buoyed on a stream from a fire\nhose. It must be the exit to the surface, he thought, and in a second\nheld out the axe he gripped in his hand.\n\nThe handle caught at the opening as he went sailing by, jammed, swung\nhis body against the wall with a smack. Peter's body flashed past,\ncaught up short by the cord, and also hit the body of airless space on\nthe outer side of the channel.\n\nThey climbed dazedly to their feet and struggled to the narrow break.\nThey staggered out onto the surface, now bathed in the blindingly\nbrilliant light of the sun rising over the peaks of the farther\nmountains ringing the crater.\n\nAround them were the first shoots of the stubborn and hardy surface\nvegetation in this crater, dwarfed cousins of the plants below.\n\nThey caught their breath. \"Better get moving,\" said Peter finally.\n\"This sun is dangerous.\"\n\nThey started across the floor of the crater, the several hundred feet\nto where the nose of the wrecked Russian rocket rested. Both men knew\nthey were bruised from the short, mad trip. There would be scraped\nshins and knees and elbows. But they had made it, that was the thing.\n\nThey were about a hundred feet out, when suddenly Robin stopped, stared\ninto the sky. Peter followed his glance.\n\nThere was something up there. When they had first glanced up, there was\nthe Earth still in its place, though now but a crescent. There were the\nmyriad stars, and the corona-encircled sun. And now there was another\ncelestial object. A tiny spot of reddish orange was growing in the sky,\ngrowing as they watched it.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Robin in a half whisper, afraid to venture the\nthought that was rioting around in his head.\n\nPeter simply stared, transfixed.\n\nThe moving spot of fire grew rapidly, enlarged, took shape. It was a\ntiny stream of energy, like the tail of a tiny comet. It came still\ncloser. Now they could see a flash of white and silver at its core,\nand still it drew closer. Now it took definite shape, a tiny body of\nmetal and paint riding down on a long stream of atomic fire!\n\nThen in mere seconds it hung over them, no longer tiny but a giant\ntower of polished metal hanging over the crater floor, falling ever\nmore slowly, its great column of rocket fire reaching and scorching the\nsurface of the rock. And suddenly, the fire was gone, there was a faint\nthud felt through the ground, and the two brothers stood staring.\n\nOut there, not very distant, was standing a glorious, tall, slender\nrocket ship, fresh with paint, beautifully and delicately balanced on\nfinely tapered fins, graceful as only a space craft can be.\n\nOn its side, clearly visible in the sunlight, was a large blue circle\non which was superimposed the white star of the United States Air\nForce. There were numbers and things and a small, black air lock now\nopening near the nose of the rocket, but Robin and Peter hardly noticed\nthese through the tears of joy that sprang to their eyes as they ran\nand bounded over the Moon's surface to greet their rescuers. Waving\ntheir hands, shouting, heedless of whether they were being heard, they\nwere Robinson Crusoes no longer. They were on their way home.\n\n\n\n\n_ABOUT THE AUTHOR_\n\n\nDonald A.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
