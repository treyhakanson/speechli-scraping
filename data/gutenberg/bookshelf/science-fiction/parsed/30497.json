On the way in, it had stopped at Gibraltar, Barcelona,\nMarseilles, Genoa, Naples, and Athens--the main friendly ports on the\nnorthern side of the Mediterranean. On the way back, it performed the same\nritual on the African side of the sea. Its most famous passengers were the\nAmerican Secretary of State, two senators, and three representatives.\n\nIts most important passenger was Mr. Raphael Poe.\n\nDuring the voyage in, Mr. Raphael Poe remained locked in a stateroom, all\nby himself, twiddling his thumbs restlessly and playing endless games of\nsolitaire, making bets with himself on how long it would be before the\nship hit the next big wave and wondering how long it would take a man to\ngo nuts in isolation. On the voyage back, he was not aboard the\n_Woonsocket_ at all, and no one missed him because only the captain and\ntwo other Navy men had known he was aboard, and they knew that he had been\ndropped overboard at Istanbul.\n\nThe sleek, tapered cylindroid might easily have been mistaken for a Naval\ntorpedo, since it was roughly the same size and shape. Actually, it was a\nsort of hybrid, combining the torpedo and the two-man submarine that the\nJapanese had used in World War II, plus refinements contributed by such\napparently diverse arts as skin-diving, cybernetics, and nucleonics.\n\nInside this one-man underwater vessel, Raphael Poe lay prone, guiding the\nlittle atomic-powered submarine across the Black Sea, past Odessa, and up\nthe Dnieper. The first leg, the four hundred miles from the Bosporous to\nthe mouth of the river, was relatively easy. The two hundred and sixty\nmiles from there to the Dnepropetrovsk was a little more difficult, but\nnot terribly so. It became increasingly more difficult as the Dnieper\nnarrowed and became more shallow.\n\nOn to Kiev. His course changed at Dnepropetrovsk, from northeast to\nnorthwest, for the next two hundred fifty miles. At Kiev, the river\nchanged course again, heading north. Three hundred and fifty miles farther\non, at Smolensk, he was heading almost due east.\n\nIt had not been an easy trip. At night, he had surfaced to get his\nbearings and to recharge the air tanks. Several times, he had had to take\nto the land, using the caterpillar treads on the little machine, because\nof obstacles in the river.\n\nAt the end of the ninth day, he was still one hundred eighty miles from\nMoscow, but, at that point, he got out of the submarine and prepared\nhimself for the trip overland. When he was ready, he pressed a special\nbutton on the control panel of the expensive little craft. Immediately,\nthe special robot brain took over. It had recorded the trip upstream; by\napplying that information in reverse--a \"mirror image,\" so to speak--it\nbegan guiding itself back toward Istanbul, applying the necessary\ncorrective factors that made the difference between an upstream and a\ndownstream trip. If it had made a mistake or had been discovered, it would\nhave blown itself to bits. As a tribute to modern robotics and\nultra-microminiaturization, it is a fact that the little craft was picked\nup five days later a few miles from Istanbul by the U.S.S. _Paducah_.\n\nBy that time, a certain Vladimir Turenski, a shambling not-too-bright deaf\nmute, had made his fully documented appearance in Moscow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpies, like fairies and other such elusive sprites, traditionally come in\nrings. The reason for this circumstructural metaphor is obscure, but it\nremains a fact that a single spy, all by himself, is usually of very\nlittle use to anybody. Espionage, on any useful scale, requires\norganization.\n\nThere is, as there should be, a reason for this. The purpose of espionage\nis to gather information--preferably, _useful_ information--against the\nwishes of, and in spite of the efforts of, a group--usually referred to\nas \"the enemy\"--which is endeavoring to prevent that information from\ngetting into other hands than their own. Such activities obviously imply\ncommunication. An espioneur, working for Side A, who finds a bit of\nimportant information about Side B must obviously communicate that bit of\ninformation to Side A or it is of no use whatsoever.\n\nAll of these factors pose complex problems.\n\nTo begin with, the espioneur must get himself into a position in which he\ncan get hold of the information he wants. Usually, that means that he must\npass himself off as something he is not, a process which requires time.\nThen, when he gets the information he is after, he must get it to his\nemployers quickly. Information, like fish, becomes useless after a certain\namount of time, and, unlike fish, there is no known way of refrigerating\nit to retard spoilage.\n\nIt is difficult to transmit information these days. It is actually easier\nfor the espioneur to transmit it than to get it, generally speaking, but\nit is difficult for him to do both jobs at once, so the spy ring's two\nmajor parts consist of the ones who get the information from the enemy and\nthe ones who transmit it back to their employers.\n\nWithout magic, it is difficult for a single spy to be of any benefit. And\n\"magic,\" in this case, can be defined as some method by which information\ncan be either obtained or transmitted without fear of discovery by the\nenemy. During World War I, a competent spy equipped with a compact\ntransistorized short-wave communications system could have had himself a\nball. If the system had included a miniature full-color television camera,\nhe could have gone hog wild. In those days, such equipment would have been\nmagic.\n\nAll this is not _\u00e0 propos_ of nothing. Mr. Raphael Poe was, in his own\nway, a magician.\n\nIt is not to be supposed that the United States of America had no spy\nrings in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics at that time. There were\nplenty of them. Raphael Poe could have, if it were so ordained, availed\nhimself of the services of any one or all of them. He did not do so for\ntwo reasons. In the first place, the more people who are in on a secret,\nthe more who can give it away. In other words, a ring, like a chain, is\nonly as strong as its weakest section. In the second place, Raphael Poe\ndidn't need any assistance in the first place.\n\nThat is, he needed no more assistance that most magicians do--a shill in\nthe audience. In this particular case, the shill was his brother, Leonard\nPoe.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOperation Mapcase was as ultra-secret as it could possibly be. Although\nthere were perhaps two dozen men who knew of the existence of the\noperation by its code name, such as the Naval officers who had helped get\nRaphael Poe to his destination, there were only five men who really knew\nwhat Operation Mapcase was all about.\n\nTwo of these were, of course, Raphael and Leonard Poe. Two others were the\nPresident of the United States and the Secretary of Defense. The fifth was\nColonel Julius T. Spaulding, of United States Army Intelligence.\n\nOn the seventh day after Raphael Poe's arrival in Moscow, the other four\nmen met in Blair House, across the street from the White House, in a room\nespecially prepared for the purpose. No one but the President knew the\nexact purpose of the meeting, although they had an idea that he wanted\nmore information of some kind.\n\nThe President himself was the last to arrive. Leaving two Secret Service\nmen standing outside the room, he carefully closed the door and turned to\nface the Secretary of Defense, Colonel Spaulding, and Leonard Poe. \"Sit\ndown, gentlemen,\" he said, seating himself as he spoke.\n\n\"Gentlemen, before we go any further, I must conduct one final experiment\nin order to justify Operation Mapcase. I will not explain it just yet.\" He\nlooked at Lenny Poe, a small, dark-haired man with a largish nose. \"Mr.\nPoe, can you contact your brother at this moment?\"\n\nLenny Poe was a man who was not overawed by anyone, and had no inclination\nto be formal, not even toward the President. \"Yeah, sure,\" he said\nmatter-of-factly.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe President glanced at his watch. \"It is now five minutes of ten. That\nmakes it five minutes of six in the evening in Moscow. Is your brother\nfree to move around? That is, can he go to a certain place in the city?\"\n\nLenny closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them. \"Rafe says he can go\nany place that the average citizen would be allowed to go.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" said the President. He gave Lenny an address--an intersection\nof two streets not far from Red Square. \"Can he get there within fifteen\nminutes?\"\n\n\"Make it twenty,\" said Lenny.\n\n\"Very well. Twenty minutes. When he gets there, I'll ask you to relay\nfurther instructions.\"\n\nLenny Poe closed his eyes, folded his arms, and relaxed in his chair. The\nother three men waited silently.\n\nNineteen minutes later, Lenny opened his eyes and said: \"O.K. He's there.\nNow what?\"\n\n\"There is a lamppost on that corner, I believe,\" said the President. \"Can\nyour brother see it?\"\n\nLenny closed his eyes again. \"Sure. There's a guy leaning against it.\"\n\nThe President's eyes brightened. \"Describe him!\"\n\nLenny, eyes still closed, said: \"Five feet ten, heavy set, gray hair,\ndark-rimmed glasses, brown suit, flashy necktie. By the cut of his\nclothes, I'd say he was either British or American, probably American.\nFifty-five or fifty-six years old.\"\n\nIt was obvious to the Secretary of Defense and to Colonel Spaulding that\nthe President was suppressing some inward excitement.\n\n\"Very good, Mr. Poe!\" he said. \"Now, you will find a box of colored\npencils and a sketch pad in that desk over there. Can you draw me a fairly\naccurate sketch of that man?\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure.\" Lenny opened his eyes, moved over to the desk, took out the\npencils and sketch pad, and went to work. He had to close his eyes\noccasionally, but his work was incredibly rapid and, at the same time,\nalmost photographically accurate.\n\nAs the picture took form, the President's inward excitement increased\nperceptibly. When it was finally finished, Lenny handed the sketch to the\nPresident without a word.\n\nThe President took it eagerly and his face broke out in his famous grin.\n\"Excellent! Perfect!\" He looked at Lenny. \"Your brother hasn't attracted\nthe man's attention in any way, has he?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" said Lenny.\n\n\"Fine. The experiment is over. Relay my thanks to your brother. He can go\nahead with whatever he was doing now.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand,\" said the Secretary of State.\n\n\"I felt it necessary to make one final experiment of my own devising,\" the\nPresident said. \"I wanted Raphael Poe to go to a particular place at a\nparticular time, with no advance warning, to transmit a picture of\nsomething he had never seen before. I arranged this test myself, and I am\npositive that there could be no trickery.\"\n\n\"Never seen before?\" the Secretary repeated bewilderedly. He gestured at\nthe sketch. \"Why, that's obviously Bill Donovan, of the Moscow delegation.\nPoe could have seen a photograph of him somewhere before.\"\n\n\"Even so,\" the President pointed out, \"there would be no way of knowing\nthat he would be at that spot. But that's beside the point. Look at that\nnecktie!\"\n\n\"I had noticed it,\" the Defense Secretary admitted.\n\nIt was certainly an outstanding piece of neckwear. As drawn by Leonard\nPoe, it was a piece of brilliant chartreuse silk, fully three and a half\ninches wide at its broadest. Against that background, rose-pink nude girls\nwere cavorting with pale mauve satyrs.\n\n\"That tie,\" said the President, \"was sent to me fifteen years ago by on of\nmy constituents, when I was in Congress. I never wore it, of course, but\nit would have been criminal to have thrown away such a magnificently\nobscene example of bad taste as that.\n\n\"I sent it to Donovan in a sealed diplomatic pouch by special courier,\nwith instructions to wear it at this time. He, of course, has no idea why\nhe is standing there. He is merely obeying orders.\n\n\"Gentlemen, this is completely convincing to me. Absolutely no one but\nmyself knew what I had in mind. It would have required telepathy even to\ncheat.\n\n\"Thank you very much, Mr. Poe. Colonel Spaulding, you may proceed with\nOperation Mapcase as planned.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Dr. Malekrinova, will you initial these requisition forms, please.\"\n\nDr. Sonya Malekrinova, a dowdy-looking, middle-aged woman with unplucked\neyebrows and a mole on her chin, adjusted her steel-rimmed glasses, took\nthe proffered papers from the clerk, ran her eyes over them, and then put\nher initials on the bottom of each page.\n\n\"Thank you, Comrade Doctor,\" said the clerk when she handed back the sheaf\nof papers.\n\n\"Certainly, Comrade.\"\n\nAnd the two of them went about their business.\n\nNot far away, in the Cathedral of St. Basil, Vladimir Turenski, alias\nRaphael Poe, was also apparently going about his business. The cathedral\nhad not seen nor heard the Liturgy of the Russian Orthodox Church or any\nother church, for a good many decades. The Bolsheviks, in their zeal to\nprotect the citizens of the Soviet Unions from the pernicious influence of\nreligion, had converted it into a museum as soon as possible.\n\nIt was the function of _Tovarishch_ Turenski to push a broom around the\nfloors of the museum, and this he did with great determination and\nefficiency. He also cleaned windows and polished metalwork when the\noccasion demanded. He was only one of a large crew of similarly employed\nmen, but he was a favorite with the Head Custodian, who not only felt\nsorry for the simple-minded deaf-mute, but appreciated the hard work he\ndid. If, on occasion, Comrade Turenski would lean on his broom and fall\ninto a short reverie, it was excusable because he still managed to get all\nhis work done.\n\nBehind Comrade Turenski, a guide was explaining a display to a group of\ntourists, but Turenski ignored the distraction and kept his mind focused\non the thoughts of Dr. Sonya Malekrinova.\n\nAfter nearly ten months of patient work, Raphael Poe had hit upon\nsomething that was, to his way of thinking, more important than all the\ninformation he had transmitted to Washington thus far.\n\nPicking brains telepathically was not, even for him, an easy job. He had\nthe knack and the training but, in addition, there was the necessity of\nestablishing a rapport with the other mind. Since he was a physicist and\nnot a politician, it was much easier to get information from the mind of\nSonya Malekrinova than to get it from the Premier. The only person with\nwhom he could keep in contact over any great distance was his brother, and\nthat only because the two of them had grown up together.\n\nHe could pick up the strongest thoughts of any nearby person very easily.\nHe did not need to hear the actual words, for instance, of a nearby\nconversation in order to follow it perfectly, because the words of verbal\ncommunication were strong in a person's mind.\n\nBut getting deeper than that required an increasing amount of\nunderstanding of the functioning of the other person's mind.\n\nHis ability to eavesdrop on conversations had been of immense benefit to\nWashington so far, but is was difficult for him to get close enough to the\nhigher-ups in the Soviet government to get all the data that the President\nof the United States wanted.\n\nBut now that he had established a firm mental linkage with one of the\ngreatest physicists in the Soviet Union, he could begin to send\ninformation that would be of tremendous value to the United States.\n\nHe brushed up a pile of trash, pushed it into a dust pan, and carried it\noff toward the disposal chute that led to the trash cans. In the room\nwhere the brooms were kept, he paused and closed his eyes.\n\n_Lenny! Are picking this up?_\n\n_Sure, Rafe. I'm ready with the drawing board anytime you are._\n\nAs Dr. Sonya Malekrinova stood in her laboratory looking over the\napparatus she was perfecting for the glory of the Soviet State, she had no\nnotion that someone halfway around the world was also looking at it over\nher shoulder--or rather, through her own eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLenny started with the fives first, and worked his way up to the larger\ndenominations.\n\n\"Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty--forty, fifty, sixty....\"\nhe muttered happily to himself. \"Two fifty, three, three-fifty, four,\nfour-fifty.\"\n\nIt was all there, so he smiled benevolently at the man in the pay window.\n\"Thank you muchly.\" Then he stepped aside to let another lucky man cash a\nwinning ticket.\n\nHis horse had come in at fifteen, six-ten, four-fifty for Straight, Place,\nand Show, and sixty bucks on the nose had paid off very nicely.\n\nLenny Poe took out his copy of the _Daily Racing Form_ and checked over\nthe listing for the next race.\n\n_Hm-m-m, ha. Purse, $7500. Four-year-olds and up: handicap. Seven\nfurlongs. Turf course. Hm-m-m, ha._\n\nLenny Poe had a passion for throwing his money away on any unpredictable\nevent that would offer him odds. He had, deep down, an artistic soul, but\nhe didn't let that interfere with his desire to lay a bet at the drop of\nan old fedora.\n\nHe had already decided, several hours before, that Ducksoup, in the next\nrace, would win handily and would pay off at something like twenty or\ntwenty-five to one. But he felt it his duty to look one last time at the\nprevious performance record, just to be absolutely positive.\n\nSatisfied, he folded the _Racing Form_, shoved it back into his pocket,\nand walked over to the fifty-dollar window.\n\n\"Gimmie nine tickets on Ducksoup in the seventh,\" he said, plonking the\nhandful of bills down on the counter.\n\nBut before the man behind the window grating could take the money, a huge,\nhamlike, and rather hairy hand came down on top of his own hand, covering\nit and the money at the same time.\n\n\"Hold it, Lenny,\" said a voice at the same time.\n\nLenny jerked his head around to his right and looked up to see a largish\nman who had \"cop\" written all over him. Another such individual crowded\npast Lenny on his left to flash a badge on the man in the betting window,\nso that he would know that this wasn't a holdup.\n\n\"Hey!\" said Lenny. His mind was thinking fast. He decided to play his\nfavorite role, that of the indignant Italian. \"Whatsa da matta with you,\nhah? Thisa no a free country? A man gotta no rights?\"\n\n\"Come on, Mr. Poe,\" the big man said quietly, \"this is important.\"\n\n\"Poe? You outta you mind? Thatsa name of a river----or a raven. I'm a\nforgetta which. My namesa Manelli!\"\n\n\"_Scusi, signore_,\" the big man said with exaggerated politeness, \"_ma se\nlei \u00e8 veramente italiano, non' \u00e8 l'uomo che cerchiamo._\"\n\nLenny's Italian was limited to a handful of words. He know he was trapped,\nbut he faced the situation with aplomb. \"Thatsa lie! I was inna Chicago\nthat night!\"\n\n\"_Ah! Cos\u00e8 credero. Avanti, saccentone._\" He jerked his thumb toward the\ngate. \"Let's go.\"\n\nLenny muttered something that the big man didn't quite catch.\n\n\"What'd you say?\"\n\n\"Upper United States--the northern United States,\" Lenny said calmly\nshoving his four hundred fifty dollars into his pocket. \"That's where\nChicago is. Never mind. Come in, boys; back to the drawing board.\"\n\nThe two men escorted Lenny to a big, powerful Lincoln; he climbed into the\nback seat with the big one while the other one got behind the wheel.\n\nAs soon as they had left the racetrack and were well out on the highway,\nthe driver said: \"You want to call in, Mario? This traffic is pretty\nheavy.\"\n\nThe big man beside Lenny leaned forward, over the back of the front seat,\nunhooked the receiver of the scrambler-equipped radiophone, and sat back\ndown. He thumbed a button on the side of the handset and said: \"This is\nSeven Oh Two.\" After a short silence, he said: \"You can call off the net.\nYou want him brought in?\" He listened for a moment. \"O.K. Are we cleared\nthrough the main gate? O.K. Off.\"\n\nHe leaned forward to replace the receiver, speaking to the driver as he\ndid so. \"Straight to the Air Force base. They've got a jet waiting there\nfor him.\"\n\nHe settled back comfortably and looked at Lenny. \"You could at least tell\npeople where you're going.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Lenny. He folded his arms, closed his eyes, and relaxed.\n\"Right now, I'm going off to dreamland.\"\n\nHe waited a short while to see if the other would say anything. He didn't,\nso Lenny proceeded to do exactly what he had promised to do.\n\nHe went off to dreamland.\n\nHe had not been absolutely sure, when he made the promise, that he would\nactually do just that, but the odds were in favor of it. It was now one\no'clock in the morning in Moscow, and Lenny's brother, Raphael, was a man\nof regular habits.\n\nLenny reached out. When he made contact, all he got was a jumble of hash.\nIt was as though someone had made a movie by cutting bits and snippets\nfrom a hundred different films, no bit more than six or seven frames long,\nwith a sound track that might or might not match, and projected the result\nthrough a drifting fog, using an ever-changing lens that rippled like the\nsurface of a wind-ruffled pool. Sometimes one figure would come into sharp\nfocus for a fraction of a second, sometimes in color, sometimes not.\n\nSometimes Lenny was merely observing the show, sometimes he was in it.\n\n_Rafe! Hey, Rafe! Wake up!_\n\nThe jumble of hash began to stabilize, becoming more coherent--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLenny sat behind the far desk, watching his brother come up the primrose\npath in a unicycle. He pulled it to a halt in front of the desk, opened\nthe pilot's canopy, threw out a rope ladder, and climbed down. His gait\nwas a little awkward, in spite of the sponge-rubber floor, because of the\nhuge flowered carpetbag he was carrying. A battered top hat sat\nprecariously on his blond, curly hair.\n\n\"Lenny! Boy, am I glad to see you! I've got it! The whole trouble is in\nthe wonkler, where the spadulator comes across the trellis grid!\" He\nlifted the carpetbag and sat it down on the lab table. \"Connect up the\ngroffle meter! We'll show those pentagon pickles who has the push-and-go\nhere!\"\n\n\"Rafe,\" Lenny said gently, \"wake up. You're dreaming. You're asleep. I\nwant to talk to you.\"\n\n\"I know.\" He grinned widely. \"And you don't want any back talk from me!\nYok-yok-yok! Just wait'll I show you!\"\n\nIn his hands, he held an object which Lenny did not at first understand.\nThen Rafe's mind brought it into focus.\n\n\"This\"--Rafe held it up--\"is a rocket motor!\"\n\n\"Rafe, wake up!\" Lenny said.\n\nThe surroundings stabilized a little more.\n\n\"I will in just a minute, Lenny.\" Rafe was apologetic. \"But let me show\nyou this.\" It did bear some resemblance to a rocket motor. It was about as\nlong as a man's forearm and consisted of a bulbous chamber at one end,\nwhich narrowed down into a throat and then widened into a hornlike exhaust\nnozzle. The chamber was black; the rest was shiny chrome.\n\nRafe grasped it by the throat with one hand. The other, he clasped firmly\naround the combustion chamber. \"Watch! Now watch!\"\n\nHe gave the bulbous, rubbery chamber a hard squeeze--\n\n\"_SQUAWK!_\" went the horn.\n\n\"Rafe!\" Lenny shouted. \"Wake up! WAKE UP!\"\n\nRafe blinked as the situation clarified. \"What? Just A Second. Lenny.\nJust....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"... _A second._\"\n\nRaphael Poe blinked his eyes open. The moon was shining through the dirty\nwindows of the dingy little room that was all he could call home--for a\nwhile, at least. Outside the window were the gray streets of Moscow.\n\nHis brother's thoughts resounded in his fully awake brain. _Rafe! You\nawake?_\n\n_Sure. Sure. What is it?_\n\nThe conversation that followed was not in words or pictures, but a weird\ncombination of both, plus a strong admixture of linking concepts that were\nneither.\n\nIn essence, Lenny merely reported that he had taken the day off to go to\nthe races and that Colonel Spaulding was evidently upset for some reason.\nHe wondered if Rafe were in any kind of trouble.\n\n_No trouble. Everything's fine at this end. But Dr. Malekrinova won't be\nback on the job until tomorrow afternoon--or,_ this _afternoon,\nrather._\n\n_I know_, Lenny replied. _That's why I figured I could take time off for a\ngo at the ponies._\n\n_I wonder why they're in such a fuss, then?_ Rafe thought.\n\n_I'll let you know when I find out_, Lenny said. _Go back to sleep and\ndon't worry._\n\n[Illustration]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a small office in the Pentagon, Colonel Julius T. Spaulding cradled the\ntelephone on his desk and looked at the Secretary of Defense. \"That was\nthe airfield. Poe will be here shortly. We'll get to the bottom of this\npretty quickly.\"\n\n\"I hope so, Julius,\" the Secretary said heavily. \"The president is\nbeginning to think we're both nuts.\"\n\nThe colonel, a lean, nervous man with dark, bushy eyebrows and a mustache\nto match, rolled his eyes up toward the ceiling. \"I'm beginning to agree\nwith him.\"\n\nThe Defense Secretary scowled at him. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Anybody who takes telepathy seriously is considered a nut,\" said the\ncolonel.\n\n\"True,\" said the Secretary, \"but that doesn't mean we _are_ nuts.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah?\" The colonel took the cigar out of his mouth a gestured with\nit. \"Anybody who'd do something that convinces all his friends he's nuts\nmust be nuts.\"\n\nThe Secretary smiled wanly. \"I wish you wouldn't be so logical. You almost\nconvince me.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" said the colonel. \"I'm not ready to have this room measured\nfor sponge-rubber wallpaper just yet. Operation Mapcase has helped a lot\nin the past few months, and it will help even more.\"\n\n\"All you have to do is get the bugs out of it,\" said the Secretary.\n\n\"If we did that,\" Colonel Spaulding said flatly, \"the whole operation\nwould fold from lack of personnel.\"\n\n\"Just carry on the best you can,\" the Secretary said gloomily as he got\nup to leave. \"I'll let you handle it.\"\n\n\"Fine. I'll call you later.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwenty minutes after the Defense Secretary had gone, Lenny Poe was shown\ninto Colonel Spaulding's office. The agent who had brought him in closed\nthe door gently, leaving him alone with the colonel.\n\n\"I told you I'd be back this evening. What were you in such a hurry\nabout?\"\n\n\"You're supposed to stay in touch,\" Colonel Spaulding pointed out. \"I\ndon't mind your penchant for ponies particularly, but I'd like to know\nwhere to find you if I need you.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't mind in the least, colonel. I'd phone you every fifteen\nminutes if that's what you wanted. Except for one thing.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\nLenny jerked a thumb over his shoulder. \"Your linguistically talented\nflatfeet. Did you ever try to get into a floating crap game when you were\nbeing followed by a couple of bruisers who look more like cops than cops\ndo?\"\n\n\"Look, Poe, I can find you plenty of action right here in Washington, if\nit won't offend your tender sensibilities to shoot crap with a senator or\ntwo. Meanwhile, sit down and listen. This is important.\"\n\nLenny sat own reluctantly. \"O.K. What is it?\"\n\n\"Dr. Davenport and his crew are unhappy about that last batch of drawings\nyou and I gave 'em.\"\n\n\"What's the matter? Don't they like the color scheme? I never thought\nscientists had any artistic taste, anyway.\"\n\n\"It's got nothing to do with that. The--\"\n\nThe phone rang. Colonel Spaulding scooped it up and identified himself.\nThen: \"What? Yeah. All right, send him in.\"\n\nHe hung up and looked back at Lenny. \"Davenport. We can get his story\nfirsthand. Just sit there and look important.\"\n\nLenny nodded. He knew that Dr. Amadeus Davenport was aware that the source\nof those drawings was Soviet Russia, but he did not know how they had been\nobtained. As far as he knew, it was just plain, ordinary spy work.\n\nHe came in briskly. He was a tall, intelligent-looking man with a rather\ncraggy face and thoughtful brown eyes. He put a large brief case on the\nfloor, and, after the preliminaries were over, he came right to the point.\n\n\"Colonel Spaulding, I spoke to the Secretary of Defense, and he agreed\nthat perhaps this situation might be cleared up if I talked directly with\nyou.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" the colonel said. \"Just what is it that seems to be bothering\nyou?\"\n\n\"These drawings,\" Davenport said, \"don't make any sense. The device\nthey're supposed to represent couldn't do anything. Look; I'll show you.\"\n\nHe took from his brief case photostatic copies of some of the drawings\nLenny had made. Five of them were straight blueprint-type drawings; the\nsixth was a copy of Lenny's near-photographic paintings of the device\nitself.\n\n\"This component, here,\" he said, gesturing at the set of drawings, \"simply\nbaffles us. We're of the opinion that your agents are known to the Soviet\ngovernment and have been handed a set of phony plans.\"\n\n\"What's it supposed to do?\" Lenny asked.\n\n\"We don't know what it's _supposed_ to do,\" the scientist said, \"but it's\ndoubtful that it would _actually_ do anything.\" He selected one of the\nphotocopies. \"See that thing? The one shaped like the letter Q with an\noffset tail? According to the specifications, it is supposed to be painted\nemerald green, but there's no indication of what it is.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLenny Poe reached out, picked up the photocopy and looked at it. It\nwas--or had been--an exact copy of the drawing that was used by Dr. Sonya\nMalekrinova. But, whereas the original drawing has been labeled entirely\nin Cyrillic characters, these labels were now in English.\n\nThe drawings made no sense to Lenny at all. They hadn't when he'd made\nthem. His brother was a scientist, but Lenny understood none of it.\n\n\"Who translated the Russian into English?\" he asked.\n\n\"A Mr. Berensky. He's one of our best experts on the subject. I assure you\nthe translations are accurate, Dr. Davenport said.\n\n\"But if you don't know what that thing is,\" the colonel objected, \"how\ncan you say the device won't work? Maybe it would if that Q-shaped thing\nwas--\"\n\n\"I know what you mean,\" Davenport interrupted. \"But that's not the only\npart of the machine that doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nHe went on to explain other discrepancies he had detected in the drawings,\nbut none of it penetrated to Lenny, although Colonel Spaulding seemed to\nbe able to follow the physicist's conversation fairly readily.\n\n\"Well, what's you suggestion, doctor?\" the colonel asked at last.\n\n\"If you agents could get further data,\" the physicist said carefully, \"it\nmight be of some use. At the same time, I'd check up on the possibility\nthat your agents are known to the NKVD.\"\n\n\"I'll see what can be done,\" said the colonel. \"Would you mind leaving\nthose copies of the drawings with me for a while?\"\n\n\"Go right ahead,\" Davenport said. \"One other thing. If we assume this\ndevice is genuine, then it must serve some purpose. It might help if we\nknew what the device is supposed to _do_.\"\n\n\"I'll see what can be done,\" Colonel Spaulding repeated.\n\nWhen Davenport had gone, Spaulding looked at Poe. \"Got any explanation for\nthat one?\"\n\n\"No,\" Lenny admitted. \"All I can do is check with Rafe. He won't be awake\nfor a few hours yet. I'll check on it and give you an answer in the\nmorning.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEarly next morning, Colonel Spaulding walked through his outer office. He\nstopped at the desk where the pretty brunette WAC sergeant was typing\nindustriously, leaned across the desk, and gave her his best leer. \"How\nabout a date tonight, music lover?\" he asked, \"'_Das Rheingold_' is\nplaying tonight. A night at the opera would do you good.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" she said primly, \"you know enlisted women aren't allowed\nto date officers.\"\n\n\"Make out an application for OCS. I'll sign it.\"\n\nShe smiled at him. \"But then I wouldn't have any excuse for turning you\ndown. And then what would my husband say?\"\n\n\"I'll bribe him. I'll send _him_ to OCS.\"\n\n\"He's not eligible. Officers are automatically disqualified.\"\n\nColonel Spaulding sighed. \"A guy can't win against competition like that.\nAnything new this morning?\"\n\n\"Mr. Poe is waiting in your office. Other than that, there's just the\nroutine things.\"\n\nHe went on into his office. Lenny Poe was seated behind the colonel's\ndesk, leaning back in the swivel chair, his feet on the top of the desk.\nHe was sound asleep.\n\nThe colonel walked over to the desk, took his cigar from his mouth, and\nsaid: \"_Good_ morrrning, Colonel Spaulding!\"\n\nLenny snapped awake. \"I'm not Colonel Spaulding,\" he said.\n\n\"Then why are you sitting in Colonel Spaulding's chair?\"\n\n\"I figured if I was asleep nobody'd know the difference.\" Lenny got up and\nwalked over to one of the other chairs. \"These don't lean back\ncomfortably. I can't sleep in 'em.\"\n\n\"You can sleep later. How was your session with Rafe?\"\n\nLenny glowered glumly. \"I wish you and Rafe hadn't talked me into this\njob. It's a strain on the brain. I don't know how he expects anyone to\nunderstand all that garbage.\"\n\n\"All what garbage?\"\n\nLenny waved a hand aimlessly. \"All this scientific guff. I'm an artist,\nnot a scientist. If Rafe can get me a clear picture of something, I can\ncopy it, but when he tries to explain something scientific, he might as\nwell be thinking in Russian or Old Upper Middle High Martian or\nsomething.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Colonel Spaulding, looking almost as glum as Lenny. \"Did\nyou get anything at all that would help Dr. Davenport figure out what\nthose drawings mean?\"\n\n\"Rafe says that the translations are all wrong,\" Lenny said, \"but I can't\nget a clear picture of just what _is_ wrong.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nColonel Spaulding thought for a while in silence. Telepathy--at least in\nso far as the Poe brothers practiced it--certainly had its limitations.\nLenny couldn't communicate mentally with anyone except his brother Rafe.\nRafe could pick up the thoughts of almost anyone if he happened to be\nclose by, but couldn't communicate over a long distance with anyone but\nLenny.\n\nThe main trouble lay in the fact that it was apparently impossible to\ntransmit a concept directly from Brain A to Brain B unless the basic\nbuilding blocks of the concept were already present in Brain B. Raphael\nPoe, for instance, had spent a long time studying Russian, reading\nDostoevski, Tolstoy, and Turgenev in the original tongue, familiarizing\nhimself with modern Russian thought through the courtesy of _Izvestia_,\n_Pravda_, and _Krokodil_, and, finally, spending time in the United\nNations building and near the Russian embassy in order to be sure that he\ncould understand the mental processes involved.\n\nNow, science has a language of its own. Or, rather, a multiplicity of\nlanguages, each derived partly from the native language of the various\nscientific groups and partly of borrowings from other languages. In the\nphysical sciences especially, the language of mathematics is a further\naddition.\n\nMore than that, the practice of the scientific method automatically\ninduces a thought pattern that is different from the type of thought\npattern that occurs in the mind of a person who is not scientifically\noriented.\n\nLenny's mind was a long way from being scientifically oriented. Worse, he\nwas a bigot. He not only didn't know why the light in his room went on\nwhen he flipped the switch, he didn't _want_ to know. To him, science was\njust so much flummery, and he didn't want his brain cluttered up with it.\n\nFacts mean nothing to a bigot. He has already made up his mind, and he\ndoesn't intend to have his solid convictions disturbed by anything so\nunimportant as a contradictory fact. Lenny was of the opinion that all\nmathematics was arcane gobbledygook, and his precise knowledge of the\nmathematical odds in poker and dice games didn't abate that opinion one\nwhit. Obviously, a mind like that is utterly incapable of understanding a\nprojected thought of scientific content; such a thought bounces off the\nimpregnable mind shield that the bigot has set up around his little area\nof bigotry.\n\nColonel Spaulding had been aware of these circumstances since the\ninception of the Operation Mapcase. Even though he, himself, had never\nexperienced telepathy more than half a dozen times in his life, he had\nmade a study of the subject and was pretty well aware of its limitations.\nThe colonel might have dismissed--as most men do--his own fleeting\nexperiences as \"coincidence\" or \"imagination\" if it had not been for the\nthings he had seen and felt in Africa during World War II. He had only\nbeen a captain then, on detached duty with British Intelligence, under\ncrusty old Colonel Sir Cecil Haversham, who didn't believe a word of \"all\nthat mystic nonsense.\" Colonel Haversham had made the mistake of\nalienating one of the most powerful of the local witch doctors.\n\nThe British Government had hushed it all up afterwards, of course, but\nSpaulding still shuddered when he thought of the broken-spirited,\nshrunken caricature of his old self that Colonel Haversham had become\nafter he told the witch doctor where to get off.\n\nSpaulding had known that there were weaknesses in the telepathic\ncommunication linkage that was the mainspring of Operation Mapcase, but he\nhad thought that they could be overcome by the strengths of the system.\nLenny had no blockage whatever against receiving visual patterns and\ndesigns. He could reproduce an electronic wiring diagram perfectly\nbecause, to him, it was not a grouping of scientific symbols, but a design\nof lines, angles, and curves.\n\nAt first, it is true, he had had a tendency to change them here and there,\nto make the design balance better, to make it more aesthetically\nsatisfying to his artistic eye, but that tendency had been easily\novercome, and Colonel Spaulding was quite certain that that wasn't what\nwas wrong now.\n\nStill--\n\n\"Lenny,\" he said carefully, \"are you sure you didn't jigger up those\ndrawings to make 'em look prettier?\"\n\nLenny Poe gave the colonel a look of disgust. \"Positive. Rafe checked 'em\nover every inch of the way as I was drawing them, and he rechecked again\nlast night--or this morning--on those photostats Davenport gave us. That's\nwhen he said there was something wrong with the translations.\n\n\"But he couldn't make it clear just what was wrong, eh?\"\n\nLenny shrugged. \"How anybody could make any sense out of that gobbledegook\nis beyond me.\"\n\nThe colonel blew out a cloud of cigar smoke and looked thoughtfully at the\nceiling. As long as the diagrams were just designs on paper, Lenny Poe\ncould pick them up fine. Which meant that everything was jim-dandy as long\nas the wiring diagrams were labeled in the Cyrillic alphabet. The labels\nwere just more squiggles to be copied as a part of the design.\n\nBut if the labels were in English, Lenny's mind would try to \"make sense\"\nout of them, and since scientific concepts did _not_ \"make sense\" to him,\nthe labels came out as pure nonsense. In one of his drawings, a lead wire\nhad been labeled \"simply ground to powder,\" and if the original drawing\nhadn't been handy to check with, it might have taken quite a bit of\nthought to realize that what was meant was \"to power supply ground.\"\nAnother time, a GE 2N 188A transistor had come out labeled GEZNISSA. There\nwere others--much worse.\n\nRussian characters, on the other hand, didn't have to make any sense to\nLenny, so his mind didn't try to force them into a preconceived mold.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLenny unzipped the leather portfolio he had brought with him--a\nspecially-made carrier that looked somewhat like an oversized brief case.\n\n\"Maybe these'll help,\" he said.\n\n\"We managed to get two good sketches of the gadget--at least, as much of\nit as that Russian lady scientist has put together so far. I kind of like\nthe rather abstract effect you get from all those wires snaking in and\naround, with that green glass tube in the center. Pretty, isn't it?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Very,\" said the colonel without conviction. \"I wonder if it will help\nDavenport any?\" He looked at the pictures for several seconds more, then,\nsuddenly, his eyes narrowed. \"Lenny--this piece of green glass--the\nthing's shaped like the letter Q.\"\n\n\"Yeah, sort of. Why?\"\n\n\"You said it was a tube, but you didn't make it look hollow when you drew\nit.\"\n\n\"It isn't; it's solid. Does a tube have to be hollow? Yeah, I guess it\ndoes, doesn't it? Well, then, it isn't a tube.\"\n\nColonel Spaulding picked up the phone and dialed a number.\n\n\"Colonel Spaulding here,\" he said after a moment. \"Let me speak to Dr.\nDavenport.\" And, after a wait: \"This is Colonel Spaulding, doctor. I think\nwe may have something for you.\"\n\n\"Good morning, colonel. I'm glad to hear that. What is it?\"\n\n\"The Q-shaped gadget--the one that you said was supposed to be painted\nemerald green. Are you _sure_ that's the right translation of the\nRussian?\"\n\n\"Well ... uh--\" Davenport hesitated. \"I can't be sure on my own say-so, of\ncourse. _I_ don't understand Russian. But I assure you that Mr. Berensky\nis perfectly reliable.\"\n\n\"Oh, I have no doubt of that,\" Colonel Spaulding said easily. \"But, tell\nme, does Mr. Berensky know how to read a circuit diagram?\"\n\n\"He does,\" Davenport said, somewhat testily. \"Of course, he wasn't shown\nthe diagram itself. We had the Russian labels copied, and he translated\nfrom a list.\"\n\n\"I had a sneaking suspicion that was it,\" said Spaulding. \"Tell me,\ndoctor, what does L-E-A-D spell?\"\n\n\"Lead,\" said the doctor promptly, pronouncing it _leed_. Then, after a\npause, he said: \"Or lead,\" this time pronouncing it _led_. \"It would\ndepend on the context.\"\n\n\"Suppose it was on a circuit diagram,\" the colonel prompted.\n\n\"Then it would probably be _leed_. What's all this leading up to,\ncolonel?\"\n\n\"Bear with me. Suppose you had a cable coming from a storage battery, and\nyou wanted to make sure that the cable was reasonably resistant to\ncorrosion, so you order it made out of the metal, lead. It would be a _led\nleed_, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Um-m-m ... I suppose so.\"\n\n\"You might get pretty confused if you didn't have a circuit diagram in\nfront of you to tell you what the label was talking about, mightn't you?\"\n\n\"I see what you mean,\" the scientist said slowly. \"But we can't show those\ncircuit diagrams to Berensky. The Secretary of Defense himself has\nclassified them as Class Triple-A Ultra-Hyper Top Secret. That puts them\njust below the Burn-The-Contents-Before-Reading class, and Berensky\ndoesn't have that kind of clearance.\"\n\n\"Then get somebody else,\" Colonel Spaulding said tiredly. \"All you need is\na man who can understand technical Russian and has a top-level secrecy\nclearance. If we haven't got at least one man in these United States with\nsuch simple qualifications as those, them we might as well give the\ncountry over to the Reds or back to the Redskins, since our culture is\nirreprievably doomed.\" And he lowered the phone gently to its cradle.\n\n\"There's no such word as 'irreprievably',\" Lenny pointed out.\n\n\"There is now,\" said Colonel Spaulding.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRaphael Poe moseyed through the streets of Moscow in an apparently aimless\nmanner. The expression on his face was that of a reasonably happy moron.\n\nHis aimless manner was only apparent. Actually, he was heading toward the\nLenin Soviet People's Higher Research Laboratories. Dr. Sonya Borisovna\nMalekrinova would be working late this evening, and he wanted to get as\nclose as possible in order to pick up as much information as he could.\n\nRafe had a great deal of admiration for that woman, he admitted to\nhimself. She was, granted, as plain as an unsalted _matzoh_. No. That was\nan understatement. If it were possible to die of the uglies, Sonya\nBorisovna would have been dangerously ill.\n\nHer disposition did nothing to alleviate that drawback. She fancied\nherself as cold, hard, analytical, and ruthless; actually she was waspish,\narrogant, overbearing, and treacherous. What she considered in herself to\nbe scientific detachment was really an isolation born of fear and distrust\nof the entire human race.\n\nTo her, Communism was a religion; \"_Das Kapital_\" and \"_The Communist\nManifesto_\" were holy writ enshrining the dogmata of Marxism-Leninism, and\nthe conflict with the West was a _jehad_, a holy war in which God, in His\nmanifestation as Dialectic Materialism, would naturally win out in the\nend.\n\nAll of which goes to show that a scientific bent, in itself, does not\nnecessarily keep one from being a bigot.\n\nRafe's admiration for the woman stemmed solely from the fact that, in\nspite of all the powerful drawbacks that existed in her mind, she was\nstill capable of being a brilliant, if somewhat erratic scientist.\n\nThere was a more relaxed air in Moscow these days. The per capita\nproduction of the Soviet Union still did not come up to that of the United\nStates, but the recent advances in technology did allow a feeling of\naccomplishment, and the hard drive for superiority was softened a trifle.\nIt was no longer considered the height of indolence and unpatriotic\ntime-wasting to sit on a bench and feed pigeons. Nor was food so scarce\nand costly that throwing away a few bread crumbs could be considered\nsabotage.\n\nSo Rafe Poe found himself a quiet corner near the Lenin Soviet People's\nLaboratories, took out a small bag of dried breadcrumbs, and was soon\nsurrounded by pigeons.\n\nDr. Malekrinova was carefully calibrating and balancing the electronic\ncircuits that energized and activated and controlled the output of the\nnewly-installed beam generator--a ring of specially-made greenish glass\nthat had a small cylinder of the same glass projecting out at a tangent.\nHer assistant, Alexis, a man of small scientific ability but a gifted\nmechanic, worked stolidly with her. It was not an easy job for Alexis;\nSonya Borisovna was by no means an easy woman to work with. There was, as\nthere should have been, a fifty-fifty division in all things--a proper\nstate of affairs in a People's Republic. Alexis Andreyevich did half the\nphysical work, got all the blame when things went wrong, and none of the\ncredit when things went right. Sonya Borisovna got the remaining fifty\npercent.\n\nSonya Borisovna Malekrinova had been pushing herself too hard, and she\nknew it. But, she told herself, for the glory of the Soviet peoples, the\nwork must go on.\n\nAfter spending two hours taking down instrument readings, she took the\nresults to her office and began to correlate them.\n\n_Have to replace that 140-9.0 micromicrofarad frequency control on stage\ntwo with something more sensitive_, she thought. _And the field modulation\ncoils require closer adjustment._\n\nShe took off her glasses and rubbed at her tired eyes while she thought.\n_Perhaps the 25 microfarad, 12 volt electrolytic condenser could be used\nto feed the pigeons, substituting a breadcrumb capacitor in the sidewalk\ncircuit._\n\nShe opened her eyes suddenly and stared at the blank wall in front of her.\n\"Pigeons?\" she said wonderingly. \"_Breadcrumb_ capacitor? Am I losing my\nmind? What kind of nonsense is that?\"\n\nShe looked back down at her notes, then replaced her glasses so that she\ncould read them. Determined not to let her mind wander in that erratic\nfashion again, she returned her attention to the work at hand.\n\nShe found herself wondering if it might not be better to chuck the whole\njob and get out while the getting was good. _The old gal_, she thought,\n_is actually tapping my mind! She's picking up everything!_\n\nSonya Borisovna sat bolt upright in her chair, staring at the blank wall\nagain. \"Why am I thinking such nonsense?\" she said aloud. \"And why should\nI be thinking in English?\" When her words registered on her ears, she\nrealized that she was actually _speaking_ in English. She was thoroughly\nacquainted with the language, of course, but it was not normal for her to\nthink in it unless she happened to be conversing with someone in that\ntongue.\n\nThe first whisper of a suspicion began to take form in the mind of Dr.\nSonya Borisovna Malekrinova.\n\nHalf a block away, Raphael Poe emptied the last of his breadcrumbs on the\nsidewalk and began walking away. He kept his mind as blank as possible,\nwhile his brow broke out in a cold sweat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That,\" said Colonel Julius Spaulding scathingly, \"is as pretty a mess as\nI've seen in years.\"\n\n\"It's a breadboard circuit, I'll admit,\" Dr. Davenport said defensively,\n\"but it's built according to the schematics you gave us.\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" said the colonel, \"during the war the British dropped our group\na radio transmitter. It was the only way to get the stuff into Africa\nquickly. The parachute failed to open. The transmitter fell two thousand\nfeet, hit the side of a mountain, and tumbled down another eight hundred\nfeet. When we found it, four days later, its wiring was in better shape\nthan that thing is in now.\"\n\n\"It's quite sufficient to test the operation of the device,\" Davenport\nsaid coldly.\n\nSpaulding had to admit to himself that it probably was. The thing was a\nslapdash affair--the colonel had a strong feeling that Davenport had\nassigned the wiring job to an apprentice and gave him half an hour to do\nthe job--but the soldering jobs looked tight enough, and the components\ndidn't look as though they'd all been pulled out of the salvage bin. What\nirritated Colonel Spaulding was Davenport's notion that the whole thing\nwas a waste of time, energy, money, and materials, and, therefore, there\nwas no point in doing a decent job of testing it at all.\n\nHe was glad that Davenport didn't know how the information about the\ndevice had been transported to the United States. As it was, he considered\nthe drawings a hoax on the part of the Russians; if he had been told that\nthey had been sent telepathically, he would probably have gone into fits\nof acute exasperation over such idiocy.\n\nThe trouble with Davenport was that, since the device didn't make any\nsense to him, he didn't believe it would function at all.\n\n\"Oh, it will do _something_, all right,\" he'd said once, \"but it won't be\nanything that needs all that apparatus. Look here--\" He had pointed toward\nthe schematic. \"Where do you think all that energy is going? All you're\ngoing to get is a little light, a lot of heat, and a couple of burned out\ncoils. I could do the same job cheaper with a dozen 250 watt light bulbs.\"\n\nTo be perfectly honest with himself, Spaulding had to admit that he wasn't\nabsolutely positive that the device would do anything in particular,\neither. His own knowledge of electronic circuitry was limited to ham radio\nexperience, and even that was many years out of date. He couldn't be\nabsolutely sure that the specifications for the gadget hadn't been garbled\nin transmission.\n\nThe Q-shaped gizmo, for instance. It had taken the better part of a week\nfor Raphael Poe to transmit the information essential to the construction\nof that enigmatic bit of glass.\n\nRafe had had to sit quietly in the privacy of his own room and print out\nthe specifications in Russian, then sit and look at the paper while Lenny\ncopied the \"design.\" Then each paper had to be carefully destroyed, which\nwasn't easy to do. You don't go around burning papers in a crowded\nRussian tenement unless you want the people in the next room to wonder\nwhat you're up to.\n\nThen the drawings Lenny had made had had to be translated into English and\nthe piece carefully made to specifications.\n\nNow here it was, all hooked up and, presumably, ready for action. Colonel\nSpaulding fervently hoped there would _be_ some action; he didn't like the\nsmug look on Dr. Amadeus Davenport's face.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe device was hooked up on a testing-room circuit and controlled from\noutside. The operation could be watched through a heavy pane of\nbulletproof glass. \"With all that power going into it,\" Davenport said, \"I\ndon't want anyone to get hurt by spatters of molten metal when those field\ncoils blow.\"\n\nThey went outside to the control console, and Dr. Davenport flipped the\nenergizing switch. After the device had warmed up on low power, Davenport\nbegan turning knobs slowly, increasing the power flow. In the testing\nroom, the device just sat there, doing nothing visible, but the meters on\nthe control console showed that something was going on. A greenish glow\ncame from the housing that surrounded the Q-shaped gadget.\n\n\"Where the Russians made their mistake in trying to fool anyone with that\nthing was in their design of that laser component,\" said Dr. Davenport.\n\"Or, I should say, the thing that is supposed to look like a laser\ncomponent.\"\n\n\"Laser?\" said Colonel Spaulding uncomprehendingly.\n\n\"It means 'light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation',\"\nDavenport explained. \"Essentially, a laser consists of a gas-filled tube\nor a solid ruby bar with parallel mirrors at both ends. By exciting the\natoms from outside, light is generated within the tube, and some of it\nbegins to bounce back and forth between the mirrors at the ends. This\ntends to have a cascade effect on the atoms which have picked up the\nenergy from outside, so that more and more of the light generated inside\nthe tube tends to be parallel to the length of the tube. One of the\nmirrors is only partially silvered, and eventually the light bouncing back\nand forth becomes powerful enough to flash through the half-silvered end,\ngiving a coherent beam of light.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's what this is supposed to be,\" said the colonel.\n\nDavenport chuckled dryly. \"Not a chance. Not with an essentially circular\ntube that isn't even silvered.\"\n\nLenny Poe, the colonel noticed, wasn't the only person around who didn't\ncare whether the thing he referred to as a \"tube\" was hollow or not.\n\n\"Is it doing anything?\" Colonel Spaulding asked anxiously, trying to read\nthe meters over Davenport's shoulder.\n\n\"It's heating up,\" Davenport said dryly.\n\nSpaulding looked back at the apparatus. A wisp of smoke was rising slowly\nfrom a big coil.\n\nA relay clicked minutely.\n\n_WHAP!_\n\nFor a confused second, everything seemed to happen at once.\n\nBut it didn't; there was a definite order to it.\n\nFirst, a spot on the ceramic tile wall of the room became suddenly\nred, orange, white hot. Then there was a little crater of incandescent\nfury, as though a small volcano had erupted in the wall. Following that,\nthere was a sputtering and crackling from the innards of the device\nitself, and a cloud of smoke arose suddenly, obscuring things in the room.\nFinally, there was the crash of circuit-breakers as they reacted to the\noverload from the short circuit.\n\nThere was silence for a moment, then the hiss of the automatic fire\nextinguishers in the testing room as they poured a cloud of carbon dioxide\nsnow on the smoldering apparatus.\n\n\"There,\" said Davenport with utter satisfaction. \"What did I tell you?\"\n\n\"You didn't tell me this thing was a heat-ray projector,\" said Colonel\nSpaulding.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Dr. Davenport said disdainfully.\n\n\"Develop the film in those automatic cameras,\" Spaulding said, \"and I'll\nshow you what I'm talking about!\"\n\nAs far as Colonel Spaulding was concerned, the film showed clearly what\nhad happened. A beam of energy had leaped from the \"tail\" of the Q-tube,\nhit the ceramic tile of the wall, and burned its way through in half a\nsecond or so. The hole in the wall, surrounded by fused ceramic, was mute\nevidence of the occurrence of what Spaulding had seen.\n\nBut Dr. Davenport pooh-poohed the whole thing. Evidence to the contrary,\nhe was quite certain that no such thing had happened. A piece of hot glass\nfrom a broken vacuum tube had done it, he insisted.\n\nA piece of hot glass had burned its way through half an inch of tile? And\na wall?\n\nDavenport muttered something about the destructive effects of shaped\ncharges. He was more willing to believe that something as wildly\nimprobable as that had happened than admit that the device had done what\nColonel Spaulding was quite certain it had done.\n\nWithin three hours, Davenport had three possible explanations of what had\nhappened, each of which required at least four unlikely things to happen\ncoincidentally.\n\nColonel Spaulding stalked back to his office in a state of angry disgust.\nJust because the thing was foreign to Davenport's notions, he had\neffectively tied his own hands--and Colonel Spaulding's, too.\n\n\"Where's Lenny Poe?\" he asked the WAC sergeant. \"I want to talk to him.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I don't know, sir. Lieutenant Fesner called in half\nan hour ago. Mr. Poe has eluded them again.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nColonel Spaulding gazed silently at the ceiling for a long moment. Then:\n\"Sergeant Nugget, take a letter. To the President of the United States,\n1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Dear Sir. Consider this my resignation. I have had so much experience\nwith jackasses lately that I have decided to change my name to Hackenbush\nand become a veterinarian. Yours truly, et cetera. Got that?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the sergeant.\n\n\"Burn it. When Fumblefingers Fesner and his boys find Lenny Poe again, I\nwant to know immediately.\"\n\nHe stalked on into his office.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRaphael Poe was beginning to feel distinctly uncomfortable. Establishing a\nclose rapport with another mind can be a distinct disadvantage at times. A\nspy is supposed to get information without giving any; a swapping of\ninformation is not at all to his advantage.\n\nIt was impossible to keep his mind a perfect blank. What he had to do was\nkeep his strongest surface thoughts entirely on innocuous things. The\ntrouble with that was that it made it extremely difficult to think about\nsome way to get out of the jam he was in. Thinking on two levels at once,\nwhile not impossible, required a nicety of control that made wire-walking\nover Niagara look easy.\n\nThe thing to do was to make the surface thoughts automatically repetitive.\nA song.\n\n    \"_In a hall of strange description (Antiquarian Egyptian),\n        Figuring his monthly balance sheet, a troubled monarch sat\n      With a frown upon his forehead, hurling interjections horrid\n        At the state of his finances, for his pocketbook was flat._\"\n\nSimultaneously, he kept a picture in his mind's eye. It had to be\nsomething vivid that would be easy to concentrate on. The first thing that\ncame to mind was the brilliant necktie that the President had used in his\ntest several months before. He conjured it up in all its chartreuse glory,\nthen he animated it. Mauve satyrs danced with rose-pink nymphs and chased\nthem over the yellow-green landscape.\n\n    \"_Not a solitary single copper cent had he to jingle\n        In his pocket, and his architects had gone off on a strike,\n      Leaving pyramids unfinished, for their wages had diminished,\n        And their credit vanished likewise, in a way they didn't like._\"\n\nRafe could tell that Dr. Malekrinova's mind was trying to reject the alien\nideas that were coming into her mind. She wasn't consciously trying to\npick up Rafe's thoughts. But the rejection was ineffective because of its\nfascination. The old business about the horse's tail. If you see a white\nhorse, you'll soon get rich if you can keep from thinking about the\nhorse's tail until it's out of sight. The first thought that comes to mind\nis: \"I mustn't think about the horse's tail.\" A self-defeating\nproposition.\n\nIf Sonya Borisovna had been certain that she was receiving the thoughts\ntelepathically, she might have been able to reject them. But her mind\nrejected the idea of telepathy instead, so she was susceptible to the\nthoughts because she thought they were her own.\n\nThe cavorting of the nymphs and satyrs became somewhat obscene, but Rafe\ndidn't bother to correct it. He had more to worry about than offending the\nrather prim mind of Dr. Malekrinova.\n\n    \"_It was harder for His Royal Highness than for sons of toil,\n        For the horny-handed workmen only ate three figs per day,\n      While the King liked sweet potatoes, puddings, pies, and canned\n          tomatoes,\n        Boneless ham, and Bluepoint oysters cooked some prehistoric way._\"\n\nWhat to do now? Should he try to get out of Russia? Was there any quick\nway out?\n\nHe had all the information he needed on the heat-beam projector that Dr.\nMalekrinova was building. The theory behind it was perfectly clear; all it\nneeded was further experimentation. If it worked out according to theory,\nit would be an almost perfect defense against even the fastest\nintercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\n    \"_As he growled, the Royal grumbler spied a bit of broken tumbler\n        In a long undusted corner just behind the chamber door.\n      When his hungry optics spied it, he stood silently and eyed it,\n        Then he smote his thigh with ecstasy and danced about the floor._\"\n\nMaybe he should try to make a run for the American Embassy. No. No one\nthere knew him, and they probably couldn't get him out of the country,\nanyway. Besides, it would take him too long to explain the situation to\nthem.\n\n    \"_'By the wit Osiris gave me! This same bit of glass shall save me!\n         I shall sell it as a diamond at some stupendous price!\n       And whoe'er I ask to take it will find, for his own sweet sake, it\n         Will be better not to wait until I have to ask him twice!'_\"\n\nThe theory behind the heat projector was simply an extension of the laser\ntheory, plus a few refinements. Inside a ring made of the proper material,\nthe light, acted upon by exterior magnetic fields, tended to move in a\ncircle, so that the photon cascade effect was all in one direction instead\nof bouncing back and forth between a pair of mirrors. That light could be\nbent around corners by making it travel through a glass rod was well\nknown, and the Malekrinova Q-tube took advantage of that effect.\n\nIn a way, the principle was similar to that of the cyclotron, except that\ninstead of spinning ions around in a circle to increase their velocity a\nbeam of coherent light was circulated to increase its intensity.\n\nThen, at the proper moment, a beam of intense coherent light shot out of\nthe tangent that formed the tail of the Q-tube. If the material of the Q\nwas properly constructed and contained atoms that fluoresced strongly in\nthe infra red, you had a heat beam that delivered plenty of power. And,\nsince the radiation was linear and \"in step,\" the Q-tube didn't heat up\nmuch at all. The cascade effect took most of the energy out as radiation.\n\n    \"_Then a Royal Proclamation was dispatched throughout the nation,\n        Most imperatively calling to appear before the King.\n      Under penalties most cruel, every man who sold a jewel\n        Or who bought and bartered precious stones, and all that sort of\n          thing._\"\n\nBut knowing all that didn't help Raphael Poe or the United States of\nAmerica one whit if the information couldn't be gotten out of Russia and\ninto Colonel Spaulding's hands. Lenny had told him of the trouble the\ncolonel was having with Dr. Davenport.\n\nIf he could only communicate with Lenny! But if he did, Dr. Malekrinova\nwould pick up every bit of it, and that would be the end of that. No, he\nhad to figure out some way to get himself and the information both out of\nthe country.\n\nMeanwhile, he had to keep thinking of an animated necktie. And he had to\nkeep singing.\n\n    \"_Thereupon, the jewelers' nether joints all quaked and knocked\n          together,\n        As they packed their Saratogas in lugubrious despair.\n      It was ever their misfortune to be pillaged by extortion,\n        And they thought they smelled a rodent on the sultry desert air._\"\n\nLenny Poe shoved open the door of Colonel Spaulding's outer office with a\nviolence that startled Sergeant Nugget.\n\n\"Is Spaulding in?\" he barked.\n\n\"I think he's expecting you,\" she said. There was no time to buzz the\ncolonel; Poe was already opening the door.\n\n\"Rafe's in trouble!\" Lenny said hurriedly, slamming the door behind him.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" snapped the colonel.\n\n\"Never mind that! Rafe's in trouble, I said! We've gotta figure a way to\nget him out of it!\"\n\nColonel Spaulding dropped all thought of bawling out Poe. \"What'd he say?\nWhat's the trouble?\"\n\n\"All he's doing is broadcasting that necktie--like an animated cartoon in\ntechnicolor. And he's singing.\"\n\n\"Singing? Singing what?\"\n\n    \"_As they faced the Great Propylon, with an apprehensive smile on,\n        Sculptured there in heiroglyphics six feet wide and nine feet high\n      Was the threat of King Rameses to chop every man to pieces\n        Who, when shown the Royal diamond, would dare refuse to buy._\"\n\nColonel Spaulding blinked. \"That's pretty. What does it mean?\"\n\n\"Nothing; it's a song, that's all. That female Russian scientist can read\nRafe's mind, and he's broadcasting this stuff to cover up!\"\n\nQuickly, he told Spaulding what the situation was as he had been able to\npiece it together from Rafe's secondary thoughts.\n\n\"Ye Gods!\" Colonel Spaulding slapped at his brow. Then he grabbed for the\ntelephone and started dialing.\n\nLenny dropped into one of the chairs, closed his eyes, and concentrated.\n\n_Rafe! Rafe! Listen to me! Rafe!_\n\n    \"_Then the richest dealer, Mulai Hassan, eyed the gem and coolly\n        Said, 'The thing is but a common tumbler-bottom, nothing more!'\n      Whereupon, the King's Assassin drew his sword, and Mulai Hassan\n        Never peddled rings again upon the Nile's primeval shore._\"\n\nBut below the interference came Rafe's thoughts. And the one thing of\nprimary importance to him was to get the information on the heat-beam\ngenerator to the United States.\n\nNo bigotry, no matter how strong, is totally impregnable. Even the most\nnarrow-minded racial bigot will make an exception if a person of the\ndespised race risks his own life to save the life of the bigot or someone\nthe bigot loves. The bigotry doesn't collapse--not by a long shot. But an\nexception is made in that one case.\n\nLenny Poe made an exception. Any information that was worth his brother's\nlife was _Important_! Therefore, it was not, could not be, scientific\ngobbledegook, no matter how it sounded.\n\n_Rafe, give it to me! Try me! I can copy it!_\n\n    \"_Then Abdullah abd Almahdi faintly said the stone was shoddy,\n        But he thought that, in a pinch, he might bid fifty cents himself.\n      There ensued a slight commotion where he could repent the notion,\n        And Abdullah was promoted to the Oriental Shelf._\"\n\n_Rafe! Stop singing that stupid song and give me the stuff! She can't\nlearn anything if you just think about that theory stuff. She already\nknows that! Come on! Give!_\n\nLenny Poe grabbed a pencil and a sheaf of paper from the colonel's desk\nand began writing frantically as the _Song of the Egyptian Diamond_\nstopped suddenly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWords. Nonsense words. That's all most of the stuff was to Lenny. It\ndidn't matter. He spelled them as he thought they should be, and if he\nmade a mistake, Rafe would correct him.\n\nRafe tried to keep a picture of the words as they would look if printed\nwhile he thought them verbally, and that helped. The information came\nacross in the only way it could come across--not as concepts, but as\nsymbols.\n\nLenny hardly noticed that the Secretary of Defense and the President had\ncome into the room. He didn't even realize that Colonel Spaulding was\nfeeding him fresh sheets of paper.\n\nLenny didn't seem to notice the time passing, nor the pain in his hand as\nthe muscles tired. He kept writing. The President left with the Defense\nSecretary and came back again after a while, but Lenny ignored them.\n\nAnd when it was over, he pushed pencil and paper aside and, massaging his\nright hand with his left, sat there with his eyes closed. Then, slowly, a\nsmile spread over his face.\n\n\"Well, I'll be damned,\" he said slowly and softly.\n\n\"Mr. Poe,\" said the President, \"is there any danger that your brother will\nbe captured within the next hour?\"\n\nLenny looked up with a startled grin. \"Oh. Hi. I didn't notice you, Mr.\nPresident. What'd you say?\"\n\nThe President repeated his question.\n\n\"Oh. No. There's nothing to worry about. The little men in white coats\ncame after Dr. Malekrinova. She started screaming that telepathic spies\nwere stealing her secret. She smashed all her apparatus and burned all her\npapers on top of the wreckage before they could stop her. She keeps\nshouting about a pink-and-purple orgy and singing a song about glass\ndiamonds and Egyptian kings. I wouldn't say she was actually insane, but\nshe is _very_ disturbed.\"\n\n\"Then your brother is safe?\"\n\n\"As safe as he ever was, Mr. President.\"\n\n\"Thank Heaven for that,\" said the President. \"If they'd ever captured him\nand made him talk--\" He stopped. \"I forgot,\" he said lamely after a\nmoment.\n\nLenny grinned. \"That's all right, Mr. President. I sometimes forget it\nmyself. But it was his handicap, I guess, that made him concentrate on\ntelepathy, so that he doesn't need his ears to hear what people are\nsaying. Maybe I could read minds the way he does if I'd been born that\nway.\n\n\"Come to think of it, I doubt if the Russians would have believed he was a\nspy if they'd caught him, unless they really did believe he was\ntelepathic. A physical examination would show immediately that he was born\nwithout eardrums and that the inner ear bones are fused. They wouldn't try\nto make a man talk if an examination showed that he really was a\ndeaf-mute.\"\n\nThe buzzer on the colonel's intercom sounded. \"Yes?\" said Spaulding.\n\n\"Dr. Davenport is here,\" said Sergeant Nugget. \"He wants to talk to you.\"\n\n\"Send him in,\" said Colonel Spaulding gleefully. \"I have a nice scientific\ntheory I want to shove down his throat.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Foreign Hand Tie, by Gordon Randall Garrett\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FOREIGN HAND TIE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 30497-8.txt or 30497-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/4/9/30497/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
