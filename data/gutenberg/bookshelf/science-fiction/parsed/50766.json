On the office wall behind him\nwere three or four framed documents in Latin that were supposed to be\nsigns of great learning, but I didn't care at that moment if he papered\nthe walls with his degrees. I had been appointed dean and president\nto see to it that the university made money. I had a job to do, and I\nmeant to do it.\n\nHe bit off each word with great restraint: \"Sociology is the study of\nsocial institutions, Mr. Halloway.\"\n\nI tried to make him understand my position. \"Look, it's the big-money\nmen who are supposed to be contributing to the support of this college.\nTo them, sociology sounds like socialism--nothing can sound worse than\nthat--and an institution is where they put Aunt Maggy when she began\ncollecting Wheaties in a stamp album. We can't appeal to them that way.\nCome on now.\" I smiled condescendingly, knowing it would irritate him.\n\"What are you doing that's worth anything?\"\n\nHe glared at me, his white hair bristling and his nostrils dilated\nlike a war horse about to whinny. I can say one thing for them--these\nscientists and professors always keep themselves well under control.\nHe had a book in his hand and I was expecting him to throw it, but he\nspoke instead:\n\n\"This department's analysis of institutional accretion, by the use of\nopen system mathematics, has been recognized as an outstanding and\nvaluable contribution to--\"\n\nThe words were impressive, whatever they meant, but this still didn't\nsound like anything that would pull in money. I interrupted, \"Valuable\nin what way?\"\n\nHe sat down on the edge of his desk thoughtfully, apparently recovering\nfrom the shock of being asked to produce something solid for his\nposition, and ran his eyes over the titles of the books that lined his\noffice walls.\n\n\"Well, sociology has been valuable to business in initiating worker\nefficiency and group motivation studies, which they now use in\nmanagement decisions. And, of course, since the depression, Washington\nhas been using sociological studies of employment, labor and standards\nof living as a basis for its general policies of--\"\n\nI stopped him with both raised hands. \"Please, Professor Caswell! That\nwould hardly be a recommendation. Washington, the New Deal and the\npresent Administration are somewhat touchy subjects to the men I have\nto deal with. They consider its value debatable, if you know what I\nmean. If they got the idea that sociology professors are giving advice\nand guidance--No, we have to stick to brass tacks and leave Washington\nout of this. What, specifically, has the work of this specific\ndepartment done that would make it as worthy to receive money as--say,\na heart disease research fund?\"\n\nHe began to tap the corner of his book absently on the desk, watching\nme. \"Fundamental research doesn't show immediate effects, Mr. Halloway,\nbut its value is recognized.\"\n\nI smiled and took out my pipe. \"All right, tell me about it. Maybe I'll\nrecognize its value.\"\n\nProf. Caswell smiled back tightly. He knew his department was at stake.\nThe other departments were popular with donors and pulled in gift\nmoney by scholarships and fellowships, and supported their professors\nand graduate students by research contracts with the government\nand industry. Caswell had to show a way to make his own department\npopular--or else. I couldn't fire him directly, of course, but there\nare ways of doing it indirectly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe laid down his book and ran a hand over his ruffled hair.\n\"Institutions--organizations, that is--\" his voice became more\nresonant; like most professors, when he had to explain something he\ninstinctively slipped into his platform lecture mannerisms, and began\nto deliver an essay--\"have certain tendencies built into the way they\nhappen to have been organized, which cause them to expand or contract\nwithout reference to the needs they were founded to serve.\"\n\nHe was becoming flushed with the pleasure of explaining his subject.\n\"All through the ages, it has been a matter of wonder and dismay\nto men that a simple organization--such as a church to worship in,\nor a delegation of weapons to a warrior class merely for defense\nagainst an outside enemy--will either grow insensately and extend its\ncontrol until it is a tyranny over their whole lives, or, like other\norganizations set up to serve a vital need, will tend to repeatedly\ndwindle and vanish, and have to be painfully rebuilt.\n\n\"The reason can be traced to little quirks in the way they were\norganized, a matter of positive and negative power feedbacks. Such\nsimple questions as, 'Is there a way a holder of authority in this\norganization can use the power available to him to increase his power?'\nprovide the key. But it still could not be handled until the complex\nquestions of interacting motives and long-range accumulations of minor\neffects could somehow be simplified and formulated. In working on the\nproblem, I found that the mathematics of open system, as introduced\nto biology by Ludwig von Bertalanffy and George Kreezer, could be\nused as a base that would enable me to develop a specifically social\nmathematics, expressing the human factors of intermeshing authority and\nmotives in simple formulas.\n\n\"By these formulations, it is possible to determine automatically the\namount of growth and period of life of any organization. The UN, to\nchoose an unfortunate example, is a shrinker type organization. Its\nmonetary support is not in the hands of those who personally benefit\nby its governmental activities, but, instead, in the hands of those\nwho would personally lose by any extension and encroachment of its\nauthority on their own. Yet by the use of formula analysis--\"\n\n\"That's theory,\" I said. \"How about proof?\"\n\n\"My equations are already being used in the study of limited-size\nFederal corporations. Washington--\"\n\nI held up my palm again. \"Please, not that nasty word again. I mean,\nwhere else has it been put into operation? Just a simple demonstration,\nsomething to show that it works, that's all.\"\n\nHe looked away from me thoughtfully, picked up the book and began to\ntap it on the desk again. It had some unreadable title and his name on\nit in gold letters. I got the distinct impression again that he was\nrepressing an urge to hit me with it.\n\nHe spoke quietly. \"All right, I'll give you a demonstration. Are you\nwilling to wait six months?\"\n\n\"Certainly, if you can show me something at the end of that time.\"\n\nReminded of time, I glanced at my watch and stood up.\n\n\"Could we discuss this over lunch?\" he asked.\n\n\"I wouldn't mind hearing more, but I'm having lunch with some\nexecutors of a millionaire's will. They have to be convinced that by,\n'furtherance of research into human ills,' he meant that the money\nshould go to research fellowships for postgraduate biologists at the\nuniversity, rather than to a medical foundation.\"\n\n\"I see you have your problems, too,\" Caswell said, conceding me\nnothing. He extended his hand with a chilly smile. \"Well, good\nafternoon, Mr. Halloway. I'm glad we had this talk.\"\n\nI shook hands and left him standing there, sure of his place in the\nprogress of science and the respect of his colleagues, yet seething\ninside because I, the president and dean, had boorishly demanded that\nhe produce something tangible.\n\nI frankly didn't give a hoot if he blew his lid. My job isn't easy.\nFor a crumb of favorable publicity and respect in the newspapers and\nan annual ceremony in a silly costume, I spend the rest of the year\ngoing hat in hand, asking politely for money at everyone's door,\nlike a well-dressed panhandler, and trying to manage the university\non the dribble I get. As far as I was concerned, a department had to\nsupport itself or be cut down to what student tuition pays for, which\nis a handful of over-crowded courses taught by an assistant lecturer.\nCaswell had to make it work or get out.\n\nBut the more I thought about it, the more I wanted to hear what he was\ngoing to do for a demonstration.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt lunch, three days later, while we were waiting for our order, he\nopened a small notebook. \"Ever hear of feedback effects?\"\n\n\"Not enough to have it clear.\"\n\n\"You know the snowball effect, though.\"\n\n\"Sure, start a snowball rolling downhill and it grows.\"\n\n\"Well, now--\" He wrote a short line of symbols on a blank page and\nturned the notebook around for me to inspect it. \"Here's the formula\nfor the snowball process. It's the basic general growth formula--covers\neverything.\"\n\nIt was a row of little symbols arranged like an algebra equation. One\nwas a concentric spiral going up, like a cross-section of a snowball\nrolling in snow. That was a growth sign.\n\nI hadn't expected to understand the equation, but it was almost as\nclear as a sentence. I was impressed and slightly intimidated by it.\nHe had already explained enough so that I knew that, if he was right,\nhere was the growth of the Catholic Church and the Roman Empire, the\nconquests of Alexander and the spread of the smoking habit and the\nchange and rigidity of the unwritten law of styles.\n\n\"Is it really as simple as that?\" I asked.\n\n\"You notice,\" he said, \"that when it becomes too heavy for the cohesion\nstrength of snow, it breaks apart. Now in human terms--\"\n\nThe chops and mashed potatoes and peas arrived.\n\n\"Go on,\" I urged.\n\nHe was deep in the symbology of human motives and the equations of\nhuman behavior in groups. After running through a few different\ntypes of grower and shrinker type organizations, we came back to the\nsnowball, and decided to run the test by making something grow.\n\n\"You add the motives,\" he said, \"and the equation will translate them\ninto organization.\"\n\n\"How about a good selfish reason for the ins to drag others into the\ngroup--some sort of bounty on new members, a cut of their membership\nfee?\" I suggested uncertainly, feeling slightly foolish. \"And maybe a\nreason why the members would lose if any of them resigned, and some\nindirect way they could use to force each other to stay in.\"\n\n\"The first is the chain letter principle,\" he nodded. \"I've got\nthat. The other....\" He put the symbols through some mathematical\nmanipulation so that a special grouping appeared in the middle of the\nequation. \"That's it.\"\n\nSince I seemed to have the right idea, I suggested some more, and he\nadded some, and juggled them around in different patterns. We threw\nout a few that would have made the organization too complicated, and\nfinally worked out an idyllically simple and deadly little organization\nsetup where joining had all the temptation of buying a sweepstakes\nticket, going in deeper was as easy as hanging around a race track, and\ngetting out was like trying to pull free from a Malayan thumb trap. We\nput our heads closer together and talked lower, picking the best place\nfor the demonstration.\n\n\"Abington?\"\n\n\"How about Watashaw? I have some student sociological surveys of it\nalready. We can pick a suitable group from that.\"\n\n\"This demonstration has got to be convincing. We'd better pick a little\ngroup that no one in his right mind would expect to grow.\"\n\n\"There should be a suitable club--\"\n\nPicture Professor Caswell, head of the Department of Sociology, and\nwith him the President of the University, leaning across the table\ntoward each other, sipping coffee and talking in conspiratorial tones\nover something they were writing in a notebook.\n\nThat was us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Ladies,\" said the skinny female chairman of the Watashaw Sewing\nCircle. \"Today we have guests.\" She signaled for us to rise, and we\nstood up, bowing to polite applause and smiles. \"Professor Caswell, and\nProfessor Smith.\" (My alias.) \"They are making a survey of the methods\nand duties of the clubs of Watashaw.\"\n\nWe sat down to another ripple of applause and slightly wider smiles,\nand then the meeting of the Watashaw Sewing Circle began. In five\nminutes I began to feel sleepy.\n\nThere were only about thirty people there, and it was a small room, not\nthe halls of Congress, but they discussed their business of collecting\nand repairing second hand clothing for charity with the same endless\nboring parliamentary formality.\n\nI pointed out to Caswell the member I thought would be the natural\nleader, a tall, well-built woman in a green suit, with conscious\ngestures and a resonant, penetrating voice, and then went into a\nhalf doze while Caswell stayed awake beside me and wrote in his\nnotebook. After a while the resonant voice roused me to attention for\na moment. It was the tall woman holding the floor over some collective\ndereliction of the club. She was being scathing.\n\nI nudged Caswell and murmured, \"Did you fix it so that a shover has a\nbetter chance of getting into office than a non-shover?\"\n\n\"I think there's a way they could find for it,\" Caswell whispered back,\nand went to work on his equation again. \"Yes, several ways to bias the\nelections.\"\n\n\"Good. Point them out tactfully to the one you select. Not as if\nshe'd use such methods, but just as an example of the reason why only\n_she_ can be trusted with initiating the change. Just mention all the\npersonal advantages an unscrupulous person could have.\"\n\nHe nodded, keeping a straight and sober face as if we were exchanging\nadmiring remarks about the techniques of clothes repairing, instead of\nconspiring.\n\nAfter the meeting, Caswell drew the tall woman in the green suit\naside and spoke to her confidentially, showing her the diagram of\norganization we had drawn up. I saw the responsive glitter in the\nwoman's eyes and knew she was hooked.\n\nWe left the diagram of organization and our typed copy of the new\nbylaws with her and went off soberly, as befitted two social science\nexperimenters. We didn't start laughing until our car passed the town\nlimits and began the climb for University Heights.\n\nIf Caswell's equations meant anything at all, we had given that sewing\ncircle more growth drives than the Roman Empire.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFour months later I had time out from a very busy schedule to wonder\nhow the test was coming along. Passing Caswell's office, I put my head\nin. He looked up from a student research paper he was correcting.\n\n\"Caswell, about that sewing club business--I'm beginning to feel the\nsuspense. Could I get an advance report on how it's coming?\"\n\n\"I'm not following it. We're supposed to let it run the full six\nmonths.\"\n\n\"But I'm curious. Could I get in touch with that woman--what's her\nname?\"\n\n\"Searles. Mrs. George Searles.\"\n\n\"Would that change the results?\"\n\n\"Not in the slightest. If you want to graph the membership rise, it\nshould be going up in a log curve, probably doubling every so often.\"\n\nI grinned. \"If it's not rising, you're fired.\"\n\nHe grinned back. \"If it's not rising, you won't have to fire me--I'll\nburn my books and shoot myself.\"\n\nI returned to my office and put in a call to Watashaw.\n\nWhile I was waiting for the phone to be answered, I took a piece of\ngraph paper and ruled it off into six sections, one for each month.\nAfter the phone had rung in the distance for a long time, a servant\nanswered with a bored drawl:\n\n\"Mrs. Searles' residence.\"\n\nI picked up a red gummed star and licked it.\n\n\"Mrs. Searles, please.\"\n\n\"She's not in just now. Could I take a message?\"\n\nI placed the star at the thirty line in the beginning of the first\nsection. Thirty members they'd started with.\n\n\"No, thanks. Could you tell me when she'll be back?\"\n\n\"Not until dinner. She's at the meetin'.\"\n\n\"The sewing club?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, sir, not that thing. There isn't any Sewing club any more, not\nfor a long time. She's at the Civic Welfare meeting.\"\n\nSomehow I hadn't expected anything like that.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said and hung up, and after a moment noticed I was\nholding a box of red gummed stars in my hand. I closed it and put it\ndown on top of the graph of membership in the sewing circle. No more\nmembers....\n\nPoor Caswell. The bet between us was ironclad. He wouldn't let me\nback down on it even if I wanted to. He'd probably quit before I put\nthrough the first slow move to fire him. His professional pride would\nbe shattered, sunk without a trace. I remembered what he said about\nshooting himself. It had seemed funny to both of us at the time,\nbut.... What a mess _that_ would make for the university.\n\nI had to talk to Mrs. Searles. Perhaps there was some outside reason\nwhy the club had disbanded. Perhaps it had not just died.\n\nI called back. \"This is Professor Smith,\" I said, giving the alias I\nhad used before. \"I called a few minutes ago. When did you say Mrs.\nSearles will return?\"\n\n\"About six-thirty or seven o'clock.\"\n\nFive hours to wait.\n\nAnd what if Caswell asked me what I had found out in the meantime? I\ndidn't want to tell him anything until I had talked it over with that\nwoman Searles first.\n\n\"Where is this Civic Welfare meeting?\"\n\nShe told me.\n\nFive minutes later, I was in my car, heading for Watashaw, driving\nconsiderably faster than my usual speed and keeping a careful watch for\nhighway patrol cars as the speedometer climbed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe town meeting hall and theater was a big place, probably with lots\nof small rooms for different clubs. I went in through the center door\nand found myself in the huge central hall where some sort of rally was\nbeing held. A political-type rally--you know, cheers and chants, with\nbunting already down on the floor, people holding banners, and plenty\nof enthusiasm and excitement in the air. Someone was making a speech up\non the platform. Most of the people there were women.\n\nI wondered how the Civic Welfare League could dare hold its meeting at\nthe same time as a political rally that could pull its members away.\nThe group with Mrs. Searles was probably holding a shrunken and almost\nmemberless meeting somewhere in an upper room.\n\nThere probably was a side door that would lead upstairs.\n\nWhile I glanced around, a pretty girl usher put a printed bulletin in\nmy hand, whispering, \"Here's one of the new copies.\" As I attempted to\nhand it back, she retreated. \"Oh, you can keep it. It's the new one.\nEveryone's supposed to have it. We've just printed up six thousand\ncopies to make sure there'll be enough to last.\"\n\nThe tall woman on the platform had been making a driving, forceful\nspeech about some plans for rebuilding Watashaw's slum section. It\nbegan to penetrate my mind dimly as I glanced down at the bulletin in\nmy hands.\n\n\"Civic Welfare League of Watashaw. The United Organization of Church\nand Secular Charities.\" That's what it said. Below began the rules of\nmembership.\n\nI looked up. The speaker, with a clear, determined voice and conscious,\nforceful gestures, had entered the homestretch of her speech, an appeal\nto the civic pride of all citizens of Watashaw.\n\n\"With a bright and glorious future--potentially without poor and\nwithout uncared-for ill--potentially with no ugliness, no vistas which\nare not beautiful--the best people in the best planned town in the\ncountry--the jewel of the United States.\"\n\nShe paused and then leaned forward intensely, striking her clenched\nhand on the speaker's stand with each word for emphasis.\n\n\"_All we need is more members. Now get out there and recruit!_\"\n\nI finally recognized Mrs. Searles, as an answering sudden blast of\nsound half deafened me. The crowd was chanting at the top of its lungs:\n\"Recruit! Recruit!\"\n\nMrs. Searles stood still at the speaker's table and behind her,\nseated in a row of chairs, was a group that was probably the board of\ndirectors. It was mostly women, and the women began to look vaguely\nfamiliar, as if they could be members of the sewing circle.\n\nI put my lips close to the ear of the pretty usher while I turned over\nthe stiff printed bulletin on a hunch. \"How long has the League been\norganized?\" On the back of the bulletin was a constitution.\n\nShe was cheering with the crowd, her eyes sparkling. \"I don't know,\"\nshe answered between cheers. \"I only joined two days ago. Isn't it\nwonderful?\"\n\nI went into the quiet outer air and got into my car with my skin\nprickling. Even as I drove away, I could hear them. They were singing\nsome kind of organization song with the tune of \"Marching through\nGeorgia.\"\n\nEven at the single glance I had given it, the constitution looked\nexactly like the one we had given the Watashaw Sewing Circle.\n\nAll I told Caswell when I got back was that the sewing circle had\nchanged its name and the membership seemed to be rising.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNext day, after calling Mrs. Searles, I placed some red stars on my\ngraph for the first three months. They made a nice curve, rising more\nsteeply as it reached the fourth month. They had picked up their first\nincrease in membership simply by amalgamating with all the other types\nof charity organizations in Watashaw, changing the club name with each\nfusion, but keeping the same constitution--the constitution with the\nbright promise of advantages as long as there were always new members\nbeing brought in.\n\nBy the fifth month, the League had added a mutual baby-sitting service\nand had induced the local school board to add a nursery school to the\ntown service, so as to free more women for League activity. But charity\nmust have been completely organized by then, and expansion had to be in\nother directions.\n\nSome real estate agents evidently had been drawn into the whirlpool\nearly, along with their ideas. The slum improvement plans began to\nblossom and take on a tinge of real estate planning later in the month.\n\nThe first day of the sixth month, a big two page spread appeared in\nthe local paper of a mass meeting which had approved a full-fledged\nscheme for slum clearance of Watashaw's shack-town section, plus plans\nfor rehousing, civic building, and rezoning. _And_ good prospects\nfor attracting some new industries to the town, industries which had\nalready been contacted and seemed interested by the privileges offered.\n\nAnd with all this, an arrangement for securing and distributing to the\nclub members _alone_ most of the profit that would come to the town in\nthe form of a rise in the price of building sites and a boom in the\nbuilding industry. The profit distributing arrangement was the same one\nthat had been built into the organization plan for the distribution\nof the small profits of membership fees and honorary promotions. It\nwas becoming an openly profitable business. Membership was rising more\nrapidly now.\n\nBy the second week of the sixth month, news appeared in the local paper\nthat the club had filed an application to incorporate itself as the\nWatashaw Mutual Trade and Civic Development Corporation, and all the\nlocal real estate promoters had finished joining en masse. The Mutual\nTrade part sounded to me as if the Chamber of Commerce was on the point\nof being pulled in with them, ideas, ambitions and all.\n\nI chuckled while reading the next page of the paper, on which a local\npolitician was reported as having addressed the club with a long\nflowery oration on their enterprise, charity, and civic spirit. He\nhad been made an honorary member. If he allowed himself to be made a\n_full_ member with its contractual obligations and its lures, if the\npoliticians went into this, too....\n\nI laughed, filing the newspaper with the other documents on the\nWatashaw test. These proofs would fascinate any businessman with the\nsense to see where his bread was buttered. A businessman is constantly\ndealing with organizations, including his own, and finding them either\ninert, cantankerous, or both. Caswell's formula could be a handle to\ngrasp them with. Gratitude alone would bring money into the university\nin carload lots.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe end of the sixth month came. The test was over and the end reports\nwere spectacular. Caswell's formulas were proven to the hilt.\n\nAfter reading the last newspaper reports, I called him up.\n\n\"Perfect, Wilt, _perfect_! I can use this Watashaw thing to get you so\nmany fellowships and scholarships and grants for your department that\nyou'll think it's snowing money!\"\n\nHe answered somewhat disinterestedly, \"I've been busy working with\nstudents on their research papers and marking tests--not following the\nWatashaw business at all, I'm afraid. You say the demonstration went\nwell and you're satisfied?\"\n\nHe was definitely putting on a chill. We were friends now, but\nobviously he was still peeved whenever he was reminded that I had\ndoubted that his theory could work. And he was using its success to\nrub my nose in the realization that I had been wrong. A man with a\nstring of degrees after his name is just as human as anyone else. I had\nneedled him pretty hard that first time.\n\n\"I'm satisfied,\" I acknowledged. \"I was wrong. The formulas work\nbeautifully. Come over and see my file of documents on it if you want a\nboost for your ego. Now let's see the formula for stopping it.\"\n\nHe sounded cheerful again. \"I didn't complicate that organization\nwith negatives. I wanted it to _grow_. It falls apart naturally when\nit stops growing for more than two months. It's like the great stock\nboom before an economic crash. Everyone in it is prosperous as long as\nthe prices just keep going up and new buyers come into the market, but\nthey all knew what would happen if it stopped growing. You remember, we\nbuilt in as one of the incentives that the members know they are going\nto lose if membership stops growing. Why, if I tried to stop it now,\nthey'd cut my throat.\"\n\nI remembered the drive and frenzy of the crowd in the one early meeting\nI had seen. They probably would.\n\n\"No,\" he continued. \"We'll just let it play out to the end of its\ntether and die of old age.\"\n\n\"When will that be?\"\n\n\"It can't grow past the female population of the town. There are only\nso many women in Watashaw, and some of them don't like sewing.\"\n\nThe graph on the desk before me began to look sinister. Surely Caswell\nmust have made some provision for--\n\n\"You underestimate their ingenuity,\" I said into the phone. \"Since they\nwanted to expand, they didn't stick to sewing. They went from general\ncharity to social welfare schemes to something that's pretty close to\nan incorporated government. The name is now the Watashaw Mutual Trade\nand Civic Development Corporation, and they're filing an application\nto change it to Civic Property Pool and Social Dividend, membership\ncontractual, open to all. That social dividend sounds like a Technocrat\nclimbed on the band wagon, eh?\"\n\nWhile I spoke, I carefully added another red star to the curve above\nthe thousand member level, checking with the newspaper that still lay\nopen on my desk. The curve was definitely some sort of log curve now,\ngrowing more rapidly with each increase.\n\n\"Leaving out practical limitations for a moment, where does the formula\nsay it will stop?\" I asked.\n\n\"When you run out of people to join it. But after all, there are only\nso many people in Watashaw. It's a pretty small town.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"They've opened a branch office in New York,\" I said carefully into the\nphone, a few weeks later.\n\nWith my pencil, very carefully, I extended the membership curve from\nwhere it was then.\n\nAfter the next doubling, the curve went almost straight up and off the\npage.\n\nAllowing for a lag of contagion from one nation to another, depending\non how much their citizens intermingled, I'd give the rest of the world\nabout twelve years.\n\nThere was a long silence while Caswell probably drew the same graph\nin his own mind. Then he laughed weakly. \"Well, you asked me for a\ndemonstration.\"\n\nThat was as good an answer as any. We got together and had lunch in a\nbar, if you can call it lunch. The movement we started will expand by\nhook or by crook, by seduction or by bribery or by propaganda or by\nconquest, but it will expand. And maybe a total world government will\nbe a fine thing--until it hits the end of its rope in twelve years or\nso.\n\nWhat happens then, I don't know.\n\nBut I don't want anyone to pin that on me. From now on, if anyone asks\nme, I've never heard of Watashaw.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Snowball Effect, by Katherine MacLean\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SNOWBALL EFFECT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 50766.txt or 50766.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/0/7/6/50766/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
