M. KORNBLUTH\n\n                       Illustrated by DON SIBLEY\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                  Galaxy Science Fiction April 1951.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n           In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man, of\n          course, is king. But how about a live wire, a smart\n          businessman, in a civilization of 100% pure chumps?\n\n\nSome things had not changed. A potter's wheel was still a potter's\nwheel and clay was still clay. Efim Hawkins had built his shop near\nGoose Lake, which had a narrow band of good fat clay and a narrow beach\nof white sand. He fired three bottle-nosed kilns with willow charcoal\nfrom the wood lot. The wood lot was also useful for long walks while\nthe kilns were cooling; if he let himself stay within sight of them,\nhe would open them prematurely, impatient to see how some new shape or\nglaze had come through the fire, and--_ping!_--the new shape or glaze\nwould be good for nothing but the shard pile back of his slip tanks.\n\nA business conference was in full swing in his shop, a modest cube\nof brick, tile-roofed, as the Chicago-Los Angeles \"rocket\" thundered\noverhead--very noisy, very swept-back, very fiery jets, shaped as\nsleekly swift-looking as an airborne barracuda.\n\nThe buyer from Marshall Fields was turning over a black-glazed one\nliter carafe, nodding approval with his massive, handsome head. \"This\nis real pretty,\" he told Hawkins and his own secretary, Gomez-Laplace.\n\"This has got lots of what ya call real est'etic principles. Yeah, it\nis real pretty.\"\n\n\"How much?\" the secretary asked the potter.\n\n\"Seven-fifty each in dozen lots,\" said Hawkins. \"I ran up fifteen dozen\nlast month.\"\n\n\"They are real est'etic,\" repeated the buyer from Fields. \"I will take\nthem all.\"\n\n\"I don't think we can do that, doctor,\" said the secretary. \"They'd\ncost us $1,350. That would leave only $532 in our quarter's budget.\nAnd we still have to run down to East Liverpool to pick up some cheap\ndinner sets.\"\n\n\"Dinner sets?\" asked the buyer, his big face full of wonder.\n\n\"Dinner sets. The department's been out of them for two months now. Mr.\nGarvy-Seabright got pretty nasty about it yesterday. Remember?\"\n\n\"Garvy-Seabright, that meat-headed bluenose,\" the buyer said\ncontemptuously. \"He don't know nothin' about est'etics. Why for don't\nhe lemme run my own department?\" His eye fell on a stray copy of\n_Whambozambo Comix_ and he sat down with it. An occasional deep chuckle\nor grunt of surprise escaped him as he turned the pages.\n\nUninterrupted, the potter and the buyer's secretary quickly closed a\ndeal for two dozen of the liter carafes. \"I wish we could take more,\"\nsaid the secretary, \"but you heard what I told him. We've had to\nturn away customers for ordinary dinnerware because he shot the last\nquarter's budget on some Mexican piggy banks some equally enthusiastic\nimporter stuck him with. The fifth floor is packed solid with them.\"\n\n\"I'll bet they look mighty est'etic.\"\n\n\"They're painted with purple cacti.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe potter shuddered and caressed the glaze of the sample carafe.\n\nThe buyer looked up and rumbled, \"Ain't you dummies through yakkin'\nyet? What good's a seckertary for if'n he don't take the burden of\n_de_-tail off'n my back, harh?\"\n\n\"We're all through, doctor. Are you ready to go?\"\n\nThe buyer grunted peevishly, dropped _Whambozambo Comix_ on the floor\nand led the way out of the building and down the log corduroy road to\nthe highway. His car was waiting on the concrete. It was, like all\ncontemporary cars, too low-slung to get over the logs. He climbed down\ninto the car and started the motor with a tremendous sparkle and roar.\n\n\"Gomez-Laplace,\" called out the potter under cover of the noise, \"did\nanything come of the radiation program they were working on the last\ntime I was on duty at the Pole?\"\n\n\"The same old fallacy,\" said the secretary gloomily. \"It stopped us on\nmutation, it stopped us on culling, it stopped us on segregation, and\nnow it's stopped us on hypnosis.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm scheduled back to the grind in nine days. Time for another\nfiring right now. I've got a new luster to try....\"\n\n\"I'll miss you. I shall be 'vacationing'--running the drafting room of\nthe New Century Engineering Corporation in Denver. They're going to put\nup a two hundred-story office building, and naturally somebody's got to\nbe on hand.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Hawkins with a sour smile.\n\nThere was an ear-piercingly sweet blast as the buyer leaned on the horn\nbutton. Also, a yard-tall jet of what looked like flame spurted up from\nthe car's radiator cap; the car's power plant was a gas turbine, and\nhad no radiator.\n\n\"I'm coming, doctor,\" said the secretary dispiritedly. He climbed down\ninto the car and it whooshed off with much flame and noise.\n\nThe potter, depressed, wandered back up the corduroy road and\ncontemplated his cooling kilns. The rustling wind in the boughs was\nobscuring the creak and mutter of the shrinking refractory brick.\nHawkins wondered about the number two kiln--a reduction fire on a load\nof lusterware mugs. Had the clay chinking excluded the air? Had it\nbeen a properly smoky blaze? Would it do any harm if he just took one\nclose--?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCommon sense took Hawkins by the scruff of the neck and yanked him\nover to the tool shed. He got out his pick and resolutely set off on a\nprospecting jaunt to a hummocky field that might yield some oxides. He\nwas especially low on coppers.\n\nThe long walk left him sweating hard, with his lust for a peek into the\nkiln quiet in his breast. He swung his pick almost at random into one\nof the hummocks; it clanged on a stone which he excavated. A largely\nobliterated inscription said:\n\n     ERSITY OF CHIC\n      OGICAL LABO\n    ELOVED MEMORY OF\n     KILLED IN ACT\n\nThe potter swore mildly. He had hoped the field would turn out to be a\ncemetery, preferably a once-fashionable cemetery full of once-massive\nbronze caskets moldered into oxides of tin and copper.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, hell, maybe there was some around anyway.\n\nHe headed lackadaisically for the second largest hillock and sliced\ninto it with his pick. There was a stone to undercut and topple into\na trench, and then the potter was very glad he'd stuck at it. His\nnostrils were filled with the bitter smell and the dirt was tinged with\nthe exciting blue of copper salts. The pick went _clang_!\n\nHawkins, puffing, pried up a stainless steel plate that was quite badly\nstained and was also marked with incised letters. It seemed to have\npulled loose from rotting bronze; there were rivets on the back that\nbrought up flakes of green patina. The potter wiped off the surface\ndirt with his sleeve, turned it to catch the sunlight obliquely and\nread:\n\n                          \"HONEST JOHN BARLOW\n\n    \"Honest John,\" famed in university annals, represents a challenge\n    which medical science has not yet answered: revival of a human being\n    accidentally thrown into a state of suspended animation.\n\n    In 1988 Mr. Barlow, a leading Evanston real estate dealer, visited\n    his dentist for treatment of an impacted wisdom tooth. His dentist\n    requested and received permission to use the experimental anesthetic\n    Cycloparadimethanol-B-7, developed at the University.\n\n    After administration of the anesthetic, the dentist resorted to his\n    drill. By freakish mischance, a short circuit in his machine\n    delivered 220 volts of 60-cycle current into the patient. (In a\n    damage suit instituted by Mrs. Barlow against the dentist, the\n    University and the makers of the drill, a jury found for the\n    defendants.) Mr. Barlow never got up from the dentist's chair and\n    was assumed to have died of poisoning, electrocution or both.\n\n    Morticians preparing him for embalming discovered, however, that\n    their subject was--though certainly not living--just as certainly\n    not dead. The University was notified and a series of exhaustive\n    tests was begun, including attempts to duplicate the trance state\n    on volunteers. After a bad run of seven cases which ended fatally,\n    the attempts were abandoned.\n\n    Honest John was long an exhibit at the University museum, and\n    livened many a football game as mascot of the University's Blue\n    Crushers. The bounds of taste were overstepped, however, when a\n    pledge to Sigma Delta Chi was ordered in '03 to \"kidnap\" Honest\n    John from his loosely guarded glass museum case and introduce him\n    into the Rachel Swanson Memorial Girls' Gymnasium shower room.\n\n    On May 22nd, 2003, the University Board of Regents issued the\n    following order: \"By unanimous vote, it is directed that the remains\n    of Honest John Barlow be removed from the University museum and\n    conveyed to the University's Lieutenant James Scott III Memorial\n    Biological Laboratories and there be securely locked in a specially\n    prepared vault. It is further directed that all possible measures\n    for the preservation of these remains be taken by the Laboratory\n    administration and that access to these remains be denied to all\n    persons except qualified scholars authorized in writing by the\n    Board. The Board reluctantly takes this action in view of recent\n    notices and photographs in the nation's press which, to say the\n    least, reflect but small credit upon the University.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was far from his field, but Hawkins understood what had happened--an\nearly and accidental blundering onto the bare bones of the Levantman\nshock anesthesia, which had since been replaced by other methods. To\nbring subjects out of Levantman shock, you let them have a squirt of\nsimple saline in the trigeminal nerve. Interesting. And now about that\nbronze--\n\nHe heaved the pick into the rotting green salts, expecting no\nresistence and almost fractured his wrist. _Something_ down there was\n_solid_. He began to flake off the oxides.\n\nA half hour of work brought him down to phosphor bronze, a huge casting\nof the almost incorruptible metal. It had weakened structurally over\nthe centuries; he could fit the point of his pick under a corroded boss\nand pry off great creaking and grumbling striae of the stuff.\n\nHawkins wished he had an archeologist with him, but didn't dream of\nreturning to his shop and calling one to take over the find. He was an\nall-around man: by choice and in his free time, an artist in clay and\nglaze; by necessity, an automotive, electronics and atomic engineer\nwho could also swing a project in traffic control, individual and\ngroup psychology, architecture or tool design. He didn't yell for a\nspecialist every time something out of his line came up; there were so\nfew with so much to do....\n\nHe trenched around his find, discovering that it was a great\nbrick-shaped bronze mass with an excitingly hollow sound. A long strip\nof moldering metal from one of the long vertical faces pulled away,\nexposing red rust that went _whoosh_ and was sucked into the interior\nof the mass.\n\nIt had been de-aired, thought Hawkins, and there must have been an\ninner jacket of glass which had crystalized through the centuries and\nquietly crumbled at the first clang of his pick. He didn't know what a\nvacuum would do to a subject of Levantman shock, but he had hopes, nor\ndid he quite understand what a real estate dealer was, but it might\nhave something to do with pottery. And _anything_ might have a bearing\non Topic Number One.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe flung his pick out of the trench, climbed out and set off at a\ndog-trot for his shop. A little rummaging turned up a hypo and there\nwas a plasticontainer of salt in the kitchen.\n\nBack at his dig, he chipped for another half hour to expose the\njuncture of lid and body. The hinges were hopeless; he smashed them off.\n\nHawkins extended the telescopic handle of the pick for the best\nleverage, fitted its point into a deep pit, set its built-in fulcrum,\nand heaved. Five more heaves and he could see, inside the vault, what\nlooked like a dusty marble statue. Ten more and he could see that it\nwas the naked body of Honest John Barlow, Evanston real estate dealer,\nuncorrupted by time.\n\nThe potter found the apex of the trigeminal nerve with his needle's\npoint and gave him 60 cc.\n\nIn an hour Barlow's chest began to pump.\n\nIn another hour, he rasped, \"Did it work?\"\n\n\"_Did_ it!\" muttered Hawkins.\n\nBarlow opened his eyes and stirred, looked down, turned his hands\nbefore his eyes--\n\n\"I'll sue!\" he screamed. \"My clothes! My fingernails!\" A horrid\nsuspicion came over his face and he clapped his hands to his hairless\nscalp. \"My hair!\" he wailed. \"I'll sue you for every penny you've got!\nThat release won't mean a damned thing in court--I didn't sign away my\nhair and clothes and fingernails!\"\n\n\"They'll grow back,\" said Hawkins casually. \"Also your epidermis. Those\nparts of you weren't alive, you know, so they weren't preserved like\nthe rest of you. I'm afraid the clothes are gone, though.\"\n\n\"What is this--the University hospital?\" demanded Barlow. \"I want\na phone. No, you phone. Tell my wife I'm all right and tell Sam\nImmerman--he's my lawyer--to get over here right away. Greenleaf\n7-4022. Ow!\" He had tried to sit up, and a portion of his pink skin\nrubbed against the inner surface of the casket, which was powdered by\nthe ancient crystalized glass. \"What the hell did you guys do, boil me\nalive? Oh, you're going to pay for this!\"\n\n\"You're all right,\" said Hawkins, wishing now he had a reference book\nto clear up several obscure terms. \"Your epidermis will start growing\nimmediately. You're not in the hospital. Look here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe handed Barlow the stainless steel plate that had labeled the casket.\nAfter a suspicious glance, the man started to read. Finishing, he laid\nthe plate carefully on the edge of the vault and was silent for a\nspell.\n\n\"Poor Verna,\" he said at last. \"It doesn't say whether she was stuck\nwith the court costs. Do you happen to know--\"\n\n\"No,\" said the potter. \"All I know is what was on the plate, and how to\nrevive you. The dentist accidentally gave you a dose of what we call\nLevantman shock anesthesia. We haven't used it for centuries; it was\npowerful, but too dangerous.\"\n\n\"Centuries ...\" brooded the man. \"Centuries ... I'll bet Sam swindled\nher out of her eyeteeth. Poor Verna. How long ago was it? What year is\nthis?\"\n\nHawkins shrugged. \"We call it 7-B-936. That's no help to you. It takes\na long time for these metals to oxidize.\"\n\n\"Like that movie,\" Barlow muttered. \"Who would have thought it? Poor\nVerna!\" He blubbered and sniffled, reminding Hawkins powerfully of the\nfact that he had been found under a flat rock.\n\nAlmost angrily, the potter demanded, \"How many children did you have?\"\n\n\"None yet,\" sniffed Barlow. \"My first wife didn't want them. But Verna\nwants one--wanted one--but we're going to wait until--we _were_ going\nto wait until--\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said the potter, feeling a savage desire to tell him off,\nblast him to hell and gone for his work. But he choked it down. There\nwas The Problem to think of; there was always The Problem to think of,\nand this poor blubberer might unexpectedly supply a clue. Hawkins would\nhave to pass him on.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Come along,\" Hawkins said. \"My time is short.\"\n\nBarlow looked up, outraged. \"How can you be so unfeeling? I'm a human\nbeing like--\"\n\nThe Los Angeles-Chicago \"rocket\" thundered overhead and Barlow broke\noff in mid-complaint. \"Beautiful!\" he breathed, following it with his\neyes. \"Beautiful!\"\n\nHe climbed out of the vault, too interested to be pained by its\nroughness against his infantile skin. \"After all,\" he said briskly,\n\"this should have its sunny side. I never was much for reading, but\nthis is just like one of those stories. And I ought to make some money\nout of it, shouldn't I?\" He gave Hawkins a shrewd glance.\n\n\"You want money?\" asked the potter. \"Here.\" He handed over a fistful\nof change and bills. \"You'd better put my shoes on. It'll be about a\nquarter-mile. Oh, and you're--uh, modest?--yes, that was the word.\nHere.\" Hawkins gave him his pants, but Barlow was excitedly counting\nthe money.\n\n\"Eighty-five, eighty-six--and it's dollars, too! I thought it'd\nbe credits or whatever they call them. 'E Pluribus Unum' and\n'Liberty'--just different faces. Say, is there a catch to this? Are\nthese real, genuine, honest twenty-two-cent dollars like we had or\njust wallpaper?\"\n\n\"They're quite all right, I assure you,\" said the potter. \"I wish you'd\ncome along. I'm in a hurry.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man babbled as they stumped toward the shop. \"Where are we\ngoing--The Council of Scientists, the World Coordinator or something\nlike that?\"\n\n\"Who? Oh, no. We call them 'President' and 'Congress.' No, that\nwouldn't do any good at all. I'm just taking you to see some people.\"\n\n\"I ought to make plenty out of this. _Plenty!_ I could write books.\nGet some smart young fellow to put it into words for me and I'll bet I\ncould turn out a best-seller. What's the setup on things like that?\"\n\n\"It's about like that. Smart young fellows. But there aren't any\nbest-sellers any more. People don't read much nowadays. We'll find\nsomething equally profitable for you to do.\"\n\nBack in the shop, Hawkins gave Barlow a suit of clothes, deposited him\nin the waiting room and called Central in Chicago. \"Take him away,\" he\npleaded. \"I have time for one more firing and he blathers and blathers.\nI haven't told him anything. Perhaps we should just turn him loose and\nlet him find his own level, but there's a chance--\"\n\n\"The Problem,\" agreed Central. \"Yes, there's a chance.\"\n\nThe potter delighted Barlow by making him a cup of coffee with a cube\nthat not only dissolved in cold water but heated the water to boiling\npoint. Killing time, Hawkins chatted about the \"rocket\" Barlow had\nadmired, and had to haul himself up short; he had almost told the real\nestate man what its top speed really was--almost, indeed, revealed that\nit was not a rocket.\n\nHe regretted, too, that he had so casually handed Barlow a couple of\nhundred dollars. The man seemed obsessed with fear that they were\nworthless since Hawkins refused to take a note or I.O.U. or even a\ndefinite promise of repayment. But Hawkins couldn't go into details,\nand was very glad when a stranger arrived from Central.\n\n\"Tinny-Peete, from Algeciras,\" the stranger told him swiftly as the\ntwo of them met at the door. \"Psychist for Poprob. Polasigned special\novertake Barlow.\"\n\n\"Thank Heaven,\" said Hawkins. \"Barlow,\" he told the man from the past,\n\"this is Tinny-Peete. He's going to take care of you and help you make\nlots of money.\"\n\nThe psychist stayed for a cup of the coffee whose preparation had\ndelighted Barlow, and then conducted the real estate man down the\ncorduroy road to his car, leaving the potter to speculate on whether he\ncould at last crack his kilns.\n\nHawkins, abruptly dismissing Barlow and the Problem, happily picked\nthe chinking from around the door of the number two kiln, prying it\nopen a trifle. A blast of heat and the heady, smoky scent of the\nreduction fire delighted him. He peered and saw a corner of a shelf\nglowing cherry-red, becoming obscured by wavering black areas as it\nlost heat through the opened door. He slipped a charred wood paddle\nunder a mug on the shelf and pulled it out as a sample, the hairs on\nthe back of his hand curling and scorching. The mug crackled and pinged\nand Hawkins sighed happily.\n\nThe bismuth resinate luster had fired to perfection, a haunting film\nof silvery-black metal with strange bluish lights in it as it turned\nbefore the eyes, and the Problem of Population seemed very far away to\nHawkins then.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBarlow and Tinny-Peete arrived at the concrete highway where the\npsychist's car was parked in a safety bay.\n\n\"What--a--_boat_!\" gasped the man from the past.\n\n\"Boat? No, that's my car.\"\n\nBarlow surveyed it with awe. Swept-back lines, deep-drawn compound\ncurves, kilograms of chrome. He ran his hands futilely over the\ndoor--or was it the door?--in a futile search for a handle, and asked\nrespectfully, \"How fast does it go?\"\n\nThe psychist gave him a keen look and said slowly, \"Two hundred and\nfifty. You can tell by the speedometer.\"\n\n\"Wow! My old Chevvy could hit a hundred on a straightaway, but you're\nout of my class, mister!\"\n\nTinny-Peete somehow got a huge, low door open and Barlow descended\nthree steps into immense cushions, floundering over to the right. He\nwas too fascinated to pay serious attention to his flayed dermis. The\ndashboard was a lovely wilderness of dials, plugs, indicators, lights,\nscales and switches.\n\nThe psychist climbed down into the driver's seat and did something with\nhis feet. The motor started like lighting a blowtorch as big as a silo.\nWallowing around in the cushions, Barlow saw through a rear-view mirror\na tremendous exhaust filled with brilliant white sparkles.\n\n\"Do you like it?\" yelled the psychist.\n\n\"It's terrific!\" Barlow yelled back. \"It's--\"\n\nHe was shut up as the car pulled out from the bay into the road with\na great _voo-ooo-ooom_! A gale roared past Barlow's head, though the\nwindows seemed to be closed; the impression of speed was terrific. He\nlocated the speedometer on the dashboard and saw it climb past 90, 100,\n150, 200.\n\n\"Fast enough for me,\" yelled the psychist, noting that Barlow's face\nfell in response. \"Radio?\"\n\nHe passed over a surprisingly light object like a football helmet,\nwith no trailing wires, and pointed to a row of buttons. Barlow put\non the helmet, glad to have the roar of air stilled, and pushed a\npushbutton. It lit up satisfyingly and Barlow settled back even farther\nfor a sample of the brave new world's super-modern taste in ingenious\nentertainment.\n\n\"TAKE IT AND STICK IT!\" a voice roared in his ears.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe snatched off the helmet and gave the psychist an injured look.\nTinny-Peete grinned and turned a dial associated with the pushbutton\nlayout. The man from the past donned the helmet again and found the\nvoice had lowered to normal.\n\n\"The show of shows! The super-show! The super-duper show! The quiz of\nquizzes! _Take it and stick it!_\"\n\nThere were shrieks of laughter in the background.\n\n\"Here we got the contes-tants all ready to go. You know how we work it.\nI hand a contes-tant a triangle-shaped cut-out and like that down the\nline. Now we got these here boards, they got cut-out places the same\nshape as the triangles and things, only they're all different shapes,\nand the first contes-tant that sticks the cutouts into the board, he\nwins.\n\n\"Now I'm gonna innaview the first contes-tant. Right here, honey.\nWhat's your name?\"\n\n\"Name? Uh--\"\n\n\"Hoddaya like that, folks? She don't remember her name! Hah? _Would\nyou buy that for a quarter?_\" The question was spoken with arch\nsignificance, and the audience shrieked, howled and whistled its\nappreciation.\n\nIt was dull listening when you didn't know the punch lines and catch\nlines. Barlow pushed another button, with his free hand ready at the\nvolume control.\n\n\"--latest from Washington. It's about Senator Hull-Mendoza. He is still\nattacking the Bureau of Fisheries. The North California Syndicalist\nsays he got affidavits that John Kingsley-Schultz is a bluenose from\nway back. He didn't publistat the affydavits, but he says they say that\nKingsley-Schultz was saw at bluenose meetings in Oregon State College\nand later at Florida University. Kingsley-Schultz says he gotta confess\nhe did major in fly-casting at Oregon and got his Ph.D. in game-fish at\nFlorida.\n\n\"And here is a quote from Kingsley-Schultz: 'Hull-Mendoza don't know\nwhat he's talking about. He should drop dead.' Unquote. Hull-Mendoza\nsays he won't publistat the affydavits to pertect his sources. He says\nthey was sworn by three former employes of the Bureau which was fired\nfor in-com-petence and in-com-pat-ibility by Kingsley-Schultz.\n\n\"Elsewhere they was the usual run of traffic accidents. A three-way\npileup of cars on Route 66 going outta Chicago took twelve lives.\nThe Chicago-Los Angeles morning rocket crashed and exploded in the\nMo-have--Mo-javvy--what-ever-you-call-it Desert. All the 94 people\naboard got killed. A Civil Aeronautics Authority investigator on the\nscene says that the pilot was buzzing herds of sheep and didn't pull\nout in time.\n\n\"Hey! Here's a hot one from New York! A Diesel tug run wild in the\nharbor while the crew was below and shoved in the port bow of the\nluck-shury liner _S. S. Placentia_. It says the ship filled and sank\ntaking the lives of an es-ti-mated 180 passengers and 50 crew members.\nSix divers was sent down to study the wreckage, but they died, too,\nwhen their suits turned out to be fulla little holes.\n\n\"And here is a bulletin I just got from Denver. It seems--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBarlow took off the headset uncomprehendingly. \"He seemed so callous,\"\nhe yelled at the driver. \"I was listening to a newscast--\"\n\nTinny-Peete shook his head and pointed at his ears. The roar of air was\ndeafening. Barlow frowned baffledly and stared out of the window.\n\nA glowing sign said:\n\n         MOOGS!\n    WOULD YOU BUY IT\n     FOR A QUARTER?\n\nHe didn't know what Moogs was or were; the illustration showed\nan incredibly proportioned girl, 99.9 per cent naked, writhing\npassionately in animated full color.\n\nThe roadside jingle was still with him, but with a new feature. Radar\nor something spotted the car and alerted the lines of the jingle. Each\nin turn sped along a roadside track, even with the car, so it could be\nread before the next line was alerted.\n\n    IF THERE'S A GIRL\n     YOU WANT TO GET\n      DEFLOCCULIZE\n    UNROMANTIC SWEAT.\n    \"A*R*M*P*I*T*T*O\"\n\nAnother animated job, in two panels, the familiar \"Before and After.\"\nThe first said, \"Just Any Cigar?\" and was illustrated with a two-person\ndomestic tragedy of a wife holding her nose while her coarse and\nred-faced husband puffed a slimy-looking rope. The second panel glowed,\n\"Or a VUELTA ABAJO?\" and was illustrated with--\n\nBarlow blushed and looked at his feet until they had passed the sign.\n\n\"Coming into Chicago!\" bawled Tinny-Peete.\n\nOther cars were showing up, all of them dreamboats.\n\nWatching them, Barlow began to wonder if he knew what a kilometer\nwas, exactly. They seemed to be traveling so slowly, if you ignored\nthe roaring air past your ears and didn't let the speedy lines of the\ndreamboats fool you. He would have sworn they were really crawling\nalong at twenty-five, with occasional spurts up to thirty. How much\nwas a kilometer, anyway?\n\nThe city loomed ahead, and it was just what it ought to be: towering\nskyscrapers, overhead ramps, landing platforms for helicopters--\n\nHe clutched at the cushions. Those two 'copters. They were going\nto--they were going to--they--\n\nHe didn't see what happened because their apparent collision courses\ntook them behind a giant building.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nScreamingly sweet blasts of sound surrounded them as they stopped for a\nred light. \"What the hell is going on here?\" said Barlow in a shrill,\nfrightened voice, because the braking time was just about zero, he\nwasn't hurled against the dashboard. \"Who's kidding who?\"\n\n\"Why, what's the matter?\" demanded the driver.\n\nThe light changed to green and he started the pickup. Barlow stiffened\nas he realized that the rush of air past his ears began just a brief,\nunreal split-second before the car was actually moving. He grabbed for\nthe door handle on his side.\n\nThe city grew on them slowly: scattered buildings, denser buildings,\ntaller buildings, and a red light ahead. The car rolled to a stop in\nzero braking time, the rush of air cut off an instant after it stopped,\nand Barlow was out of the car and running frenziedly down a sidewalk\none instant after that.\n\n_They'll track me down_, he thought, panting. _It's a secret police\nthing. They'll get you--mind-reading machines, television eyes\neverywhere, afraid you'll tell their slaves about freedom and stuff.\nThey don't let anybody cross them, like that story I once read._\n\nWinded, he slowed to a walk and congratulated himself that he had guts\nenough not to turn around. That was what they always watched for.\nWalking, he was just another business-suited back among hundreds. He\nwould be safe, he would be safe--\n\nA hand tumbled from a large, coarse, handsome face thrust close to his:\n\"Wassamatta bumpinninna people likeya owna sidewalk gotta miner slamya\ninna mushya bassar!\" It was neither the mad potter nor the mad driver.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said Barlow. \"What did you say?\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah?\" yelled the stranger dangerously, and waited for an answer.\n\nBarlow, with the feeling that he had somehow been suckered into\nthe short end of an intricate land-title deal, heard himself reply\nbelligerently, \"Yeah!\"\n\nThe stranger let go of his shoulder and snarled, \"Oh, yeah?\"\n\n\"Yeah!\" said Barlow, yanking his jacket back into shape.\n\n\"Aaah!\" snarled the stranger, with more contempt and disgust than\nferocity. He added an obscenity current in Barlow's time, a standard\nbut physiologically impossible directive, and strutted off hulking his\nshoulders and balling his fists.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBarlow walked on, trembling. Evidently he had handled it well enough.\nHe stopped at a red light while the long, low dreamboats roared before\nhim and pedestrians in the sidewalk flow with him threaded their ways\nthrough the stream of cars. Brakes screamed, fenders clanged and\ndented, hoarse cries flew back and forth between drivers and walkers.\nHe leaped backward frantically as one car swerved over an arc of\nsidewalk to miss another.\n\nThe signal changed to green, the cars kept on coming for about thirty\nseconds and then dwindled to an occasional light-runner. Barlow crossed\nwarily and leaned against a vending machine, blowing big breaths.\n\n_Look natural_, he told himself. _Do something normal. Buy something\nfrom the machine._\n\nHe fumbled out some change, got a newspaper for a dime, a handkerchief\nfor a quarter and a candy bar for another quarter.\n\nThe faint chocolate smell made him ravenous suddenly. He clawed at the\nglassy wrapper printed \"CRIGGLIES\" quite futilely for a few seconds,\nand then it divided neatly by itself. The bar made three good bites,\nand he bought two more and gobbled them down.\n\nThirsty, he drew a carbonated orange drink in another one of the glassy\nwrappers from the machine for another dime. When he fumbled with it, it\ndivided neatly and spilled all over his knees. Barlow decided he had\nbeen there long enough and walked on.\n\nThe shop windows were--shop windows. People still wore and bought\nclothes, still smoked and bought tobacco, still ate and bought food.\nAnd they still went to the movies, he saw with pleased surprise as he\npassed and then returned to a glittering place whose sign said it was\nTHE BIJOU.\n\nThe place seemed to be showing a quintuple feature, _Babies Are\nTerrible_, _Don't Have Children_, and _The Canali Kid_.\n\nIt was irresistible; he paid a dollar and went in.\n\nHe caught the tail-end of _The Canali Kid_ in three-dimensional,\nfull-color, full-scent production. It appeared to be an interplanetary\nsaga winding up with a chase scene and a reconciliation between\nestranged hero and heroine. _Babies Are Terrible_ and _Don't Have\nChildren_ were fantastic arguments against parenthood--the grotesquely\nexaggerated dangers of painfully graphic childbirth, vicious children,\nold parents beaten and starved by their sadistic offspring. The\naudience, Barlow astoundedly noted, was placidly champing sweets and\nshowing no particular signs of revulsion.\n\nThe _Coming Attractions_ drove him into the lobby. The fanfares\nwere shattering, the blazing colors blinding, and the added scents\nstomach-heaving.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen his eyes again became accustomed to the moderate lighting of the\nlobby, he groped his way to a bench and opened the newspaper he had\nbought. It turned out to be _The Racing Sheet_, which afflicted him\nwith a crushing sense of loss. The familiar boxed index in the lower\nleft hand corner of the front page showed almost unbearably that\nChurchill Downs and Empire City were still in business--\n\nBlinking back tears, he turned to the Past Performances at Churchill.\nThey weren't using abbreviations any more, and the pages because of\nthat were single-column instead of double. But it was all the same--or\nwas it?\n\nHe squinted at the first race, a three-quarter-mile maiden claimer for\nthirteen hundred dollars. Incredibly, the track record was two minutes,\nten and three-fifths seconds. Any beetle in his time could have knocked\noff the three-quarter in one-fifteen. It was the same for the other\ndistances, much worse for route events.\n\n_What the hell had happened to everything?_\n\nHe studied the form of a five-year-old brown mare in the second and\ncouldn't make head or tail of it. She'd won and lost and placed and\nshowed and lost and placed without rhyme or reason. She looked like a\nfront-runner for a couple of races and then she looked like a no-good\npig and then she looked like a mudder but the next time it rained she\nwasn't and then she was a stayer and then she was a pig again. In a\ngood five-thousand-dollar allowances event, too!\n\nBarlow looked at the other entries and it slowly dawned on him that\nthey were all like the five-year-old brown mare. Not a single damned\nhorse running had the slightest trace of class.\n\nSomebody sat down beside him and said, \"That's the story.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBarlow whirled to his feet and saw it was Tinny-Peete, his driver.\n\n\"I was in doubts about telling you,\" said the psychist, \"but I see you\nhave some growing suspicions of the truth. Please don't get excited.\nIt's all right, I tell you.\"\n\n\"So you've got me,\" said Barlow.\n\n\"_Got_ you?\"\n\n\"Don't pretend. I can put two and two together. You're the secret\npolice. You and the rest of the aristocrats live in luxury on the sweat\nof these oppressed slaves. You're afraid of me because you have to keep\nthem ignorant.\"\n\nThere was a bellow of bright laughter from the psychist that got them\nblank looks from other patrons of the lobby. The laughter didn't sound\nat all sinister.\n\n\"Let's get out of here,\" said Tinny-Peete, still chuckling. \"You\ncouldn't possibly have it more wrong.\" He engaged Barlow's arm and led\nhim to the street. \"The actual truth is that the millions of workers\nlive in luxury on the sweat of the handful of aristocrats. I shall\nprobably die before my time of overwork unless--\" He gave Barlow a\nspeculative look. \"You may be able to help us.\"\n\n\"I know that gag,\" sneered Barlow. \"I made money in my time and to make\nmoney you have to get people on your side. Go ahead and shoot me if you\nwant, but you're not going to make a fool out of me.\"\n\n\"You nasty little ingrate!\" snapped the psychist, with a kaleidoscopic\nchange of mood. \"This damned mess is all your fault and the fault of\npeople like you! Now come along and no more of your nonsense.\"\n\nHe yanked Barlow into an office building lobby and an elevator that,\ndisconcertingly, went _whoosh_ loudly as it rose. The real estate man's\nknees were wobbly as the psychist pushed him from the elevator, down a\ncorridor and into an office.\n\nA hawk-faced man rose from a plain chair as the door closed behind\nthem. After an angry look at Barlow, he asked the psychist, \"Was I\ncalled from the Pole to inspect this--this--?\"\n\n\"Unget updandered. I've dee-probed etfind quasichance exhim\nPoprobattackline,\" said the psychist soothingly.\n\n\"Doubt,\" grunted the hawk-faced man.\n\n\"Try,\" suggested Tinny-Peete.\n\n\"Very well. Mr. Barlow, I understand you and your lamented had no\nchildren.\"\n\n\"What of it?\"\n\n\"This of it. You were a blind, selfish stupid ass to tolerate economic\nand social conditions which penalized child-bearing by the prudent and\nforesighted. You made us what we are today, and I want you to know that\nwe are far from satisfied. Damn-fool rockets! Damn-fool automobiles!\nDamn-fool cities with overhead ramps!\"\n\n\"As far as I can see,\" said Barlow, \"you're running down the best\nfeatures of time. Are you crazy?\"\n\n\"The rockets aren't rockets. They're turbo-jets--good turbo-jets, but\nthe fancy shell around them makes for a bad drag. The automobiles\nhave a top speed of one hundred kilometers per hour--a kilometer is,\nif I recall my paleolinguistics, three-fifths of a mile--and the\nspeedometers are all rigged accordingly so the drivers will think\nthey're going two hundred and fifty. The cities are ridiculous,\nexpensive, unsanitary, wasteful conglomerations of people who'd\nbe better off and more productive if they were spread over the\ncountryside.\n\n\"We need the rockets and trick speedometers and cities because, while\nyou and your kind were being prudent and foresighted and not having\nchildren, the migrant workers, slum dwellers and tenant farmers were\nshiftlessly and short-sightedly having children--breeding, breeding. My\nGod, how they bred!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" objected Barlow. \"There were lots of people in our\ncrowd who had two or three children.\"\n\n\"The attrition of accidents, illness, wars and such took care of that.\nYour intelligence was bred out. It is gone. Children that should have\nbeen born never were. The just-average, they'll-get-along majority took\nover the population. The average IQ now is 45.\"\n\n\"But that's far in the future--\"\n\n\"So are you,\" grunted the hawk-faced man sourly.\n\n\"But who are _you_ people?\"\n\n\"Just people--real people. Some generations ago, the geneticists\nrealized at last that nobody was going to pay any attention to what\nthey said, so they abandoned words for deeds. Specifically, they formed\nand recruited for a closed corporation intended to maintain and improve\nthe breed. We are their descendants, about three million of us. There\nare five billion of the others, so we are their slaves.\n\n\"During the past couple of years I've designed a skyscraper, kept\nBillings Memorial Hospital here in Chicago running, headed off war with\nMexico and directed traffic at LaGuardia Field in New York.\"\n\n\"I don't understand! Why don't you let them go to hell in their own\nway?\"\n\nThe man grimaced. \"We tried it once for three months. We holed up at\nthe South Pole and waited. They didn't notice it. Some drafting-room\npeople were missing, some chief nurses didn't show up, minor government\npeople on the non-policy level couldn't be located. It didn't seem to\nmatter.\n\n\"In a week there was hunger. In two weeks there were famine and plague,\nin three weeks war and anarchy. We called off the experiment; it took\nus most of the next generation to get things squared away again.\"\n\n\"But why _didn't_ you let them kill each other off?\"\n\n\"Five billion corpses mean about five hundred million tons of rotting\nflesh.\"\n\nBarlow had another idea. \"Why don't you sterilize them?\"\n\n\"Two and one-half billion operations is a lot of operations. Because\nthey breed continuously, the job would never be done.\"\n\n\"I see. Like the marching Chinese!\"\n\n\"Who the devil are they?\"\n\n\"It was a--uh--paradox of my time. Somebody figured out that if all\nthe Chinese in the world were to line up four abreast, I think it was,\nand start marching past a given point, they'd never stop because of the\nbabies that would be born and grow up before they passed the point.\"\n\n\"That's right. Only instead of 'a given point,' make it 'the largest\nconceivable number of operating rooms that we could build and staff.'\nThere could never be enough.\"\n\n\"Say!\" said Barlow. \"Those movies about babies--was that your\npropaganda?\"\n\n\"It was. It doesn't seem to mean a thing to them. We have abandoned the\nidea of attempting propaganda contrary to a biological drive.\"\n\n\"So if you work _with_ a biological drive--?\"\n\n\"I know of none which is consistent with inhibition of fertility.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBarlow's face went poker-blank, the result of years of careful\ndiscipline. \"You don't, huh? You're the great brains and you can't\nthink of any?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" said the psychist innocently. \"Can you?\"\n\n\"That depends. I sold ten thousand acres of Siberian tundra--through\na dummy firm, of course--after the partition of Russia. The buyers\nthought they were getting improved building lots on the outskirts of\nKiev. I'd say that was a lot tougher than this job.\"\n\n\"How so?\" asked the hawk-faced man.\n\n\"Those were normal, suspicious customers and these are morons, born\nsuckers. You just figure out a con they'll fall for; they won't know\nenough to do any smart checking.\"\n\nThe psychist and the hawk-faced man had also had training; they kept\nthemselves from looking with sudden hope at each other.\n\n\"You seem to have something in mind,\" said the psychist.\n\nBarlow's poker face went blanker still. \"Maybe I have. I haven't heard\nany offer yet.\"\n\n\"There's the satisfaction of knowing that you've prevented Earth's\nresources from being so plundered,\" the hawk-faced man pointed out,\n\"that the race will soon become extinct.\"\n\n\"I don't know that,\" Barlow said bluntly. \"All I have is your word.\"\n\n\"If you really have a method, I don't think any price would be too\ngreat,\" the psychist offered.\n\n\"Money,\" said Barlow.\n\n\"All you want.\"\n\n\"More than you want,\" the hawk-faced man corrected.\n\n\"Prestige,\" added Barlow. \"Plenty of publicity. My picture and my name\nin the papers and over TV every day, statues to me, parks and cities\nand streets and other things named after me. A whole chapter in the\nhistory books.\"\n\nThe psychist made a facial sign to the hawk-faced man that meant, \"Oh,\nbrother!\"\n\nThe hawk-faced man signaled back, \"Steady, boy!\"\n\n\"It's not too much to ask,\" the psychist agreed.\n\nBarlow, sensing a seller's market, said, \"Power!\"\n\n\"Power?\" the hawk-faced man repeated puzzledly. \"Your own hydro station\nor nuclear pile?\"\n\n\"I mean a world dictatorship with me as dictator!\"\n\n\"Well, now--\" said the psychist, but the hawk-faced man interrupted,\n\"It would take a special emergency act of Congress but the situation\nwarrants it. I think that can be guaranteed.\"\n\n\"Could you give us some indication of your plan?\" the psychist asked.\n\n\"Ever hear of lemmings?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"They are--were, I guess, since you haven't heard of them--little\nanimals in Norway, and every few years they'd swarm to the coast and\nswim out to sea until they drowned. I figure on putting some lemming\nurge into the population.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I'll save that till I get the right signatures on the deal.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hawk-faced man said, \"I'd like to work with you on it, Barlow. My\nname's Ryan-Ngana.\" He put out his hand.\n\nBarlow looked closely at the hand, then at the man's face. \"Ryan what?\"\n\n\"Ngana.\"\n\n\"That sounds like an African name.\"\n\n\"It is. My mother's father was a Watusi.\"\n\nBarlow didn't take the hand. \"I thought you looked pretty dark. I don't\nwant to hurt your feelings, but I don't think I'd be at my best working\nwith you. There must be somebody else just as well qualified, I'm sure.\"\n\nThe psychist made a facial sign to Ryan-Ngana that meant, \"Steady\n_yourself_, boy!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Ryan-Ngana told Barlow. \"We'll see what arrangement can be\nmade.\"\n\n\"It's not that I'm prejudiced, you understand. Some of my best\nfriends--\"\n\n\"Mr. Barlow, don't give it another thought. Anybody who could pick on\nthe lemming analogy is going to be useful to us.\"\n\nAnd so he would, thought Ryan-Ngana, alone in the office after\nTinny-Peete had taken Barlow up to the helicopter stage. So he\nwould. Poprob had exhausted every rational attempt and the new\nPoprobattacklines would have to be irrational or sub-rational. This\ncreature from the past with his lemming legends and his improved\nbuilding lots would be a fountain of precious vicious self-interest.\n\nRyan-Ngana sighed and stretched. He had to go and run the San\nFrancisco subway. Summoned early from the Pole to study Barlow, he'd\nleft unfinished a nice little theorem. Between interruptions, he was\nslowly constructing an n-dimensional geometry whose foundations and\nsuperstructure owed no debt whatsoever to intuition.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUpstairs, waiting for a helicopter, Barlow was explaining to\nTinny-Peete that he had nothing against Negroes, and Tinny-Peete wished\nhe had some of Ryan-Ngana's imperturbability and humor for the ordeal.\n\nThe helicopter took them to International Airport where, Tinny-Peete\nexplained, Barlow would leave for the Pole.\n\nThe man from the past wasn't sure he'd like a dreary waste of ice and\ncold.\n\n\"It's all right,\" said the psychist. \"A civilized layout. Warm,\npleasant. You'll be able to work more efficiently there. All the facts\nat your fingertips, a good secretary--\"\n\n\"I'll need a pretty big staff,\" said Barlow, who had learned from\nthousands of deals never to take the first offer.\n\n\"I meant a private, confidential one,\" said Tinny-Peete readily, \"but\nyou can have as many as you want. You'll naturally have top-primary-top\npriority if you really have a workable plan.\"\n\n\"Let's not forget this dictatorship angle,\" said Barlow.\n\nHe didn't know that the psychist would just as readily have promised\nhim deification to get him happily on the \"rocket\" for the Pole.\nTinny-Peete had no wish to be torn limb from limb; he knew very\nwell that it would end that way if the population learned from this\nanachronism that there was a small elite which considered itself\nhead, shoulders, trunk and groin above the rest. The fact that this\nassumption was perfectly true and the fact that the elite was condemned\nby its superiority to a life of the most grinding toil would not be\nconsidered; the difference would.\n\nThe psychist finally put Barlow aboard the \"rocket\" with some thirty\npeople--real people--headed for the Pole.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBarlow was airsick all the way because of a post-hypnotic suggestion\nTinny-Peete had planted in him. One idea was to make him as averse as\npossible to a return trip, and another idea was to spare the other\npassengers from his aggressive, talkative company.\n\nBarlow during the first day at the pole was reminded\nof his first day in the Army. It was the same\nnow-where-the-hell-are-we-going-to-put-_you_? business until he took a\nfirm line with them. Then instead of acting like supply sergeants they\nacted like hotel clerks.\n\nIt was a wonderful, wonderfully calculated buildup, and one that he\nfailed to suspect. After all, in his time a visitor from the past would\nhave been lionized.\n\nAt day's end he reclined in a snug underground billet with the 60-mile\ngales roaring yards overhead, and tried to put two and two together.\n\nIt was like old times, he thought--like a coup in real estate where\nyou had the competition by the throat, like a 50-per cent rent boost\nwhen you knew damned well there was no place for the tenants to move,\nlike smiling when you read over the breakfast orange juice that the\ncity council had decided to build a school on the ground you had\nacquired by a deal with the city council. And it was simple. He would\njust sell tundra building lots to eagerly suicidal lemmings, and that\nwas absolutely all there was to solving the Problem that had these\ndouble-domes spinning.\n\nThey'd have to work out most of the details, naturally, but what the\nhell, that was what subordinates were for. He'd need specialists in\nadvertising, engineering, communications--did they know anything about\nhypnotism? That might be helpful. If not, there'd have to be a lot of\nbribery done, but he'd make sure--damned sure--there were unlimited\nfunds.\n\nJust selling building lots to lemmings....\n\nHe wished, as he fell asleep, that poor Verna could have been in on\nthis. It was his biggest, most stupendous deal. Verna--that sharp\nshyster Sam Immerman must have swindled her....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt began the next day with people coming to visit him. He knew the\napproach. They merely wanted to be helpful to their illustrious visitor\nfrom the past and would he help fill them in about his era, which\nunfortunately was somewhat obscure historically, and what did he think\ncould be done about the Problem? He told them he was too old to be\nroped any more, and they wouldn't get any information out of him until\nhe got a letter of intent from at least the Polar President, and a\nsession of the Polar Congress empowered to make him dictator.\n\nHe got the letter and the session. He presented his program, was asked\nwhether his conscience didn't revolt at its callousness, explained\nsuccinctly that a deal was a deal and anybody who wasn't smart enough\nto protect himself didn't deserve protection--\"Caveat emptor,\" he threw\nin for scholarship, and had to translate it to \"Let the buyer beware.\"\nHe didn't, he stated, give a damn about either the morons or their\nintelligent slaves; he'd told them his price and that was all he was\ninterested in.\n\nWould they meet it or wouldn't they?\n\nThe Polar President offered to resign in his favor, with certain\ntemporary emergency powers that the Polar Congress would vote him if\nhe thought them necessary. Barlow demanded the title of World Dictator,\ncomplete control of world finances, salary to be decided by himself,\nand the publicity campaign and historical writeup to begin at once.\n\n\"As for the emergency powers,\" he added, \"they are neither to be\ntemporary nor limited.\"\n\nSomebody wanted the floor to discuss the matter, with the declared hope\nthat perhaps Barlow would modify his demands.\n\n\"You've got the proposition,\" Barlow said. \"I'm not knocking off even\nten per cent.\"\n\n\"But what if the Congress refuses, sir?\" the President asked.\n\n\"Then you can stay up here at the Pole and try to work it out\nyourselves. I'll get what I want from the morons. A shrewd operator\nlike me doesn't have to compromise; I haven't got a single competitor\nin this whole cockeyed moronic era.\"\n\nCongress waived debate and voted by show of hands. Barlow won\nunanimously.\n\n\"You don't know how close you came to losing me,\" he said in his first\nofficial address to the joint Houses. \"I'm not the boy to haggle;\neither I get what I ask or I go elsewhere. The first thing I want is\nto see designs for a new palace for me--nothing _un_ostentatious,\neither--and your best painters and sculptors to start working on my\nportraits and statues. Meanwhile, I'll get my staff together.\"\n\nHe dismissed the Polar President and the Polar Congress, telling them\nthat he'd let them know when the next meeting would be.\n\nA week later, the program started with North America the first target.\n\nMrs. Garvy was resting after dinner before the ordeal of turning on\nthe dishwasher. The TV, of course, was on and it said: \"Oooh!\"--long,\nshuddery and ecstatic, the cue for the _Parfum Assault Criminale_ spot\ncommercial. \"Girls,\" said the announcer hoarsely, \"do you want your\nman? It's easy to get him--easy as a trip to Venus.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" said Mrs. Garvy.\n\n\"Wassamatter?\" snorted her husband, starting out of a doze.\n\n\"Ja hear that?\"\n\n\"Wha'?\"\n\n\"He said 'easy like a trip to Venus.'\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"Well, I thought ya couldn't get to Venus. I thought they just had that\none rocket thing that crashed on the Moon.\"\n\n\"Aah, women don't keep up with the news,\" said Garvy righteously,\nsubsiding again.\n\n\"Oh,\" said his wife uncertainly.\n\nAnd the next day, on _Henry's Other Mistress_, there was a new\ncharacter who had just breezed in: Buzz Rentshaw, Master Rocket Pilot\nof the Venus run. On _Henry's Other Mistress_, \"the broadcast drama\nabout you and your neighbors, _folksy_ people, _ordinary_ people,\n_real_ people\"! Mrs. Garvy listened with amazement over a cooling cup\nof coffee as Buzz made hay of her hazy convictions.\n\nMONA: Darling, it's so good to see you again!\n\nBUZZ: You don't know how I've missed you on that dreary Venus run.\n\nSOUND: _Venetian blind run down, key turned in door lock._\n\nMONA: Was it _very_ dull, dearest?\n\nBUZZ: Let's not talk about my humdrum job, darling. Let's talk about us.\n\nSOUND: _Creaking bed._\n\nWell, the program was back to normal at last. That evening Mrs. Garvy\ntried to ask again whether her husband was sure about those rockets,\nbut he was dozing right through _Take It and Stick It_, so she watched\nthe screen and forgot the puzzle.\n\nShe was still rocking with laughter at the gag line, \"Would you buy it\nfor a quarter?\" when the commercial went on for the detergent powder\nshe always faithfully loaded her dishwasher with on the first of every\nmonth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe announcer displayed mountains of suds from a tiny piece of the\nstuff and coyly added: \"Of course, Cleano don't lay around for you to\npick up like the soap root on Venus, but it's pretty cheap and it's\nalmost pretty near just as good. So for us plain folks who ain't lucky\nenough to live up there on Venus, Cleano is the real cleaning stuff!\"\n\nThen the chorus went into their \"Cleano-is-the-stuff\" jingle, but Mrs.\nGarvy didn't hear it. She was a stubborn woman, but it occurred to her\nthat she was very sick indeed. She didn't want to worry her husband.\nThe next day she quietly made an appointment with her family freud.\n\nIn the waiting room she picked up a fresh new copy of _Readers Pablum_\nand put it down with a faint palpitation. The lead article, according\nto the table of contents on the cover, was titled \"The Most Memorable\nVenusian I Ever Met.\"\n\n\"The freud will see you now,\" said the nurse, and Mrs. Garvy tottered\ninto his office.\n\nHis traditional glasses and whiskers were reassuring. She choked out\nthe ritual: \"Freud, forgive me, for I have neuroses.\"\n\nHe chanted the antiphonal: \"Tut, my dear girl, what seems to be the\ntrouble?\"\n\n\"I got like a hole in the head,\" she quavered. \"I seem to forget all\nkinds of things. Things like everybody seems to know and I don't.\"\n\n\"Well, that happens to everybody occasionally, my dear. I suggest a\nvacation on Venus.\"\n\nThe freud stared, open-mouthed, at the empty chair. His nurse came in\nand demanded, \"Hey, you see how she scrammed? What was the matter with\n_her_?\"\n\nHe took off his glasses and whiskers meditatively. \"You can search\nme. I told her she should maybe try a vacation on Venus.\" A momentary\nbafflement came into his face and he dug through his desk drawers\nuntil he found a copy of the four-color, profusely illustrated journal\nof his profession. It had come that morning and he had lip-read it,\nthough looking mostly at the pictures. He leafed through to the article\n_Advantages of the Planet Venus in Rest Cures_.\n\n\"It's right there,\" he said.\n\nThe nurse looked. \"It sure is,\" she agreed. \"Why shouldn't it be?\"\n\n\"The trouble with these here neurotics,\" decided the freud, \"is that\nthey all the time got to fight reality. Show in the next twitch.\"\n\nHe put on his glasses and whiskers again and forgot Mrs. Garvy and her\nstrange behavior.\n\n\"Freud, forgive me, for I have neuroses.\"\n\n\"Tut, my dear girl, what seems to be the trouble?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLike many cures of mental disorders, Mrs. Garvy's was achieved largely\nby self-treatment. She disciplined herself sternly out of the crazy\nnotion that there had been only one rocket ship and that one a failure.\nShe could join without wincing, eventually, in any conversation on the\ndesirability of Venus as a place to retire, on its fabulous floral\nprofusion. Finally she went to Venus.\n\nAll her friends were trying to book passage with the Evening Star\nTravel and Real Estate Corporation, but naturally the demand was\ncrushing. She considered herself lucky to get a seat at last for the\ntwo-week summer cruise. The space ship took off from a place called\nLos Alamos, New Mexico. It looked just like all the spaceships on\ntelevision and in the picture magazines, but was more comfortable than\nyou would expect.\n\nMrs. Garvy was delighted with the fifty or so fellow-passengers\nassembled before takeoff. They were from all over the country and\nshe had a distinct impression that they were on the brainy side. The\ncaptain, a tall, hawk-faced, impressive fellow named Ryan-Something\nor other, welcomed them aboard and trusted that their trip would be a\nmemorable one. He regretted that there would be nothing to see because,\n\"due to the meteorite season,\" the ports would be dogged down. It was\ndisappointing, yet reassuring that the line was taking no chances.\n\nThere was the expected momentary discomfort at takeoff and then two\nmonotonous days of droning travel through space to be whiled away in\nthe lounge at cards or craps. The landing was a routine bump and the\nvoyagers were issued tablets to swallow to immunize them against any\nminor ailments. When the tablets took effect, the lock was opened and\nVenus was theirs.\n\nIt looked much like a tropical island on Earth, except for a blanket\nof cloud overhead. But it had a heady, other-worldly quality that was\nintoxicating and glamorous.\n\nThe ten days of the vacation were suffused with a hazy magic. The soap\nroot, as advertised, was free and sudsy. The fruits, mostly tropical\nvarieties transplanted from Earth, were delightful. The simple shelters\nprovided by the travel company were more than adequate for the balmy\ndays and nights.\n\nIt was with sincere regret that the voyagers filed again into the ship,\nand swallowed more tablets doled out to counteract and sterilize any\nVenus illnesses they might unwittingly communicate to Earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVacationing was one thing. Power politics was another.\n\nAt the Pole, a small man was in a soundproof room, his face deathly\npale and his body limp in a straight chair.\n\nIn the American Senate Chamber, Senator Hull-Mendoza (Synd., N. Cal.)\nwas saying: \"Mr. President and gentlemen, I would be remiss in my duty\nas a legislature if'n I didn't bring to the attention of the au-gust\nbody I see here a perilous situation which is fraught with peril.\nAs is well known to members of this au-gust body, the perfection of\nspace flight has brought with it a situation I can only describe\nas fraught with peril. Mr. President and gentlemen, now that swift\nAmerican rockets now traverse the trackless void of space between this\nplanet and our nearest planetarial neighbor in space--and, gentlemen, I\nrefer to Venus, the star of dawn, the brightest jewel in fair Vulcan's\ndiadome--now, I say, I want to inquire what steps are being taken\nto colonize Venus with a vanguard of patriotic citizens like those\nminutemen of yore.\n\n\"Mr. President and gentlemen! There are in this world nations, envious\nnations--I do not name Mexico--who by fair means or foul may seek to\nwrest from Columbia's grasp the torch of freedom of space; nations\nwhose low living standards and innate depravity give them an unfair\nadvantage over the citizens of our fair republic.\n\n\"This is my program: I suggest that a city of more than 100,000\npopulation be selected by lot. The citizens of the fortunate city\nare to be awarded choice lands on Venus free and clear, to have and\nto hold and convey to their descendants. And the national government\nshall provide free transportation to Venus for these citizens. And this\nprogram shall continue, city by city, until there has been deposited on\nVenus a sufficient vanguard of citizens to protect our manifest rights\nin that planet.\n\n\"Objections will be raised, for carping critics we have always with\nus. They will say there isn't enough steel. They will call it a cheap\ngiveaway. I say there _is_ enough steel for _one_ city's population to\nbe transferred to Venus, and that is all that is needed. For when the\ntime comes for the second city to be transferred, the first, emptied\ncity can be wrecked for the needed steel! And is it a giveaway? Yes! It\nis the most glorious giveaway in the history of mankind! Mr. President\nand gentlemen, there is no time to waste--Venus must be American!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBlack-Kupperman, at the Pole, opened his eyes and said feebly, \"The\nstyle was a little uneven. Do you think anybody'll notice?\"\n\n\"You did fine, boy; just fine,\" Barlow reassured him.\n\nHull-Mendoza's bill became law.\n\nDrafting machines at the South Pole were busy around the clock and the\nPittsburgh steel mills spewed millions of plates into the Los Alamos\nspaceport of the Evening Star Travel and Real Estate Corporation. It\nwas going to be Los Angeles, for logistic reasons, and the three most\naccomplished psycho-kineticists went to Washington and mingled in the\ncrowd at the drawing to make certain that the Los Angeles capsule\nslithered into the fingers of the blind-folded Senator.\n\nLos Angeles loved the idea and a forest of spaceships began to blossom\nin the desert. They weren't very good space ships, but they didn't have\nto be.\n\nA team at the Pole worked at Barlow's direction on a mail setup. There\nwould have to be letters to and from Venus to keep the slightest\ntaint of suspicion from arising. Luckily Barlow remembered that the\nproblem had been solved once before--by Hitler. Relatives of persons\nincinerated in the furnaces of Lublin or Majdanek continued to get\ncheery postal cards.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Los Angeles flight went off on schedule, under tremendous press,\nnewsreel and television coverage. The world cheered the gallant\nAngelenos who were setting off on their patriotic voyage to the land\nof milk and honey. The forest of spaceships thundered up, and up, and\nout of sight without untoward incident. Billions envied the Angelenos,\ncramped and on short rations though they were.\n\nWreckers from San Francisco, whose capsule came up second, moved\nimmediately into the city of the angels for the scrap steel their own\nflight would require. Senator Hull-Mendoza's constituents could do no\nless.\n\nThe president of Mexico, hypnotically alarmed at this extension of\n_yanqui imperialismo_ beyond the stratosphere, launched his own\nVenus-colony program.\n\nAcross the water it was England versus Ireland, France versus Germany,\nChina versus Russia, India versus Indonesia. Ancient hatreds grew into\nthe flames that were rocket ships assailing the air by hundreds daily.\n\n    Dear Ed, how are you? Sam and I are fine and hope you are fine. Is\n    it nice up there like they say with food and close grone on trees?\n    I drove by Springfield yesterday and it sure looked funny all the\n    buildings down but of coarse it is worth it we have to keep the\n    greasers in their place. Do you have any truble with them on Venus?\n    Drop me a line some time. Your loving sister, Alma.\n\n    Dear Alma, I am fine and hope you are fine. It is a fine place here\n    fine climate and easy living. The doctor told me today that I seem\n    to be ten years younger. He thinks there is something in the air\n    here keeps people young. We do not have much trouble with the\n    greasers here they keep to theirselves it is just a question of us\n    outnumbering them and staking out the best places for the Americans.\n    In South Bay I know a nice little island that I have been saving\n    for you and Sam with lots of blanket trees and ham bushes. Hoping\n    to see you and Sam soon, your loving brother, Ed.\n\nSam and Alma were on their way shortly.\n\nPoprob got a dividend in every nation after the emigration had passed\nthe halfway mark. The lonesome stay-at-homes were unable to bear the\nmelancholy of a low population density; their conditioning had been to\nswarms of their kin. After that point it was possible to foist off the\ncrudest stripped-down accommodations on would-be emigrants; they didn't\ncare.\n\nBlack-Kupperman did a final job on President Hull-Mendoza, the last\njob that genius of hypnotics would ever do on any moron, important or\notherwise.\n\nHull-Mendoza, panic-stricken by his presidency over an emptying nation,\njoined his constituents. The _Independence_, aboard which traveled\nthe national government of America, was the most elaborate of all the\nspaceships--bigger, more comfortable, with a lounge that was handsome,\nthough cramped, and cloakrooms for Senators and Representatives. It\nwent, however, to the same place as the others and Black-Kupperman\nkilled himself, leaving a note that stated he \"couldn't live with my\nconscience.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe day after the American President departed, Barlow flew into a rage.\nAcross his specially built desk were supposed to flow all Poprob\nhigh-level documents and this thing--this outrageous thing--called\nPoprob_term_ apparently had got into the executive stage before he had\neven had a glimpse of it!\n\nHe buzzed for Rogge-Smith, his statistician. Rogge-Smith seemed to be\nat the bottom of it. Poprobterm seemed to be about first and second and\nthird derivatives, whatever they were. Barlow had a deep distrust of\nanything more complex than what he called an \"average.\"\n\nWhile Rogge-Smith was still at the door, Barlow snapped, \"What's the\nmeaning of this? Why haven't I been consulted? How far have you people\ngot and why have you been working on something I haven't authorized?\"\n\n\"Didn't want to bother you, Chief,\" said Rogge-Smith. \"It was really\na technical matter, kind of a final cleanup. Want to come and see the\nwork?\"\n\nMollified, Barlow followed his statistician down the corridor.\n\n\"You still shouldn't have gone ahead without my okay,\" he grumbled.\n\"Where the hell would you people have been without me?\"\n\n\"That's right, Chief. We couldn't have swung it ourselves; our minds\njust don't work that way. And all that stuff you knew from Hitler--it\nwouldn't have occurred to us. Like poor Black-Kupperman.\"\n\nThey were in a fair-sized machine shop at the end of a slight upward\nincline. It was cold. Rogge-Smith pushed a button that started a motor,\nand a flood of arctic light poured in as the roof parted slowly. It\nshowed a small spaceship with the door open.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBarlow gaped as Rogge-Smith took him by the elbow and his other boys\nappeared: Swenson-Swenson, the engineer; Tsutsugimushi-Duncan, his\npropellants man; Kalb-French, advertising.\n\n\"In you go, Chief,\" said Tsutsugimushi-Duncan. \"This is Poprobterm.\"\n\n\"But I'm the world Dictator!\"\n\n\"You bet, Chief. You'll be in history, all right--but this is\nnecessary, I'm afraid.\"\n\nThe door was closed. Acceleration slammed Barlow cruelly to the metal\nfloor. Something broke and warm, wet stuff, salty-tasting, ran from his\nmouth to his chin. Arctic sunlight through a port suddenly became a\nfierce lancet stabbing at his eyes; he was out of the atmosphere.\n\nLying twisted and broken under the acceleration, Barlow realized that\nsome things had not changed, that Jack Ketch was never asked to dinner\nhowever many shillings you paid him to do your dirty work, that murder\nwill out, that crime pays only temporarily.\n\nThe last thing he learned was that death is the end of pain.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Marching Morons, by C.M.

Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
