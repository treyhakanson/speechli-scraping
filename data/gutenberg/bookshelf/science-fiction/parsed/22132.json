S. P. Meek\n\n\n                     The yoke of Jovian oppression\n                    rests heavily on the dwellers of\n                   Earth--until Damis, the Nepthalim,\n                     comes forward to lead them in\n                            spirited revolt.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n_The Jovian Tyrant_\n\n\nGlavour, Jovian Viceroy of the Earth, looked arrogantly about as he lay\nat ease on the cushions of the ornate chariot which bore him through the\nstreets of his capital city. Like all the Jovians, he was cast in a\nheroic mold compared to his Earth-born subjects. Even for a Jovian,\nGlavour was large. He measured a good eight feet from the soles of his\nhuge splayed feet to the crown of his enormous head, crested with stiff\nblack hair which even the best efforts of Tonsome, the court barber,\nfailed to make lie in order. His keen black eyes glittered as they swept\nover the scene before him. Where only a few years before had been only\ntangled tropical jungle on the narrow neck of land separating the two\ngreat oceans, now rose row after row of stately buildings. Suddenly\nGlavour's attention was attracted by a girlish form in a passing\nchariot.\n\n\"Stop!\" he cried.\n\n[Illustration: _Before them were figures out of a nightmare._]\n\nObedient to the driver's touch on a lever, the tiny radium motor of the\nchariot ceased to revolve and the equipage stopped its forward motion.\nGlavour turned to an equerry at his side.\n\n\"Havenner,\" he exclaimed, \"did you note that maiden who passed us?\"\n\n\"I did, Your Excellency.\"\n\n\"Bring her before me.\"\n\nThe equerry sprang lightly to the ground and called out in a stentorian\nvoice. At the sound every vehicle on the street ceased its movement\nuntil the will of the Viceroy, the ruler of the Sons of God, should be\nmade known. In a few steps, his powerful Jovian muscles carrying his\nhuge body forward at a rate impossible to persons born of Earthly\nparentage who had not inherited the power needed to overcome the\nenormous gravity of Jupiter, Havenner reached the equipage containing\nthe girl. He gave a curt order and the girl's driver turned his vehicle\nand brought it alongside the Viceroy's.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nGlavour's eyes rested on the slim lithesome figure of the Earth-girl.\nShe was just emerging from the grace of girlhood into the full dignity\nof young womanhood and the soft clinging garb she wore accentuated\nrather than concealed the curves of her body. As Glavour's gaze fell on\nher, she cast down her eyes and a flush crept slowly over her pretty\nface to the mass of coppery gold hair which crowned her head. An\nexpression of brutal lust came into the Viceroy's eyes.\n\n\"Daughter of Man,\" he said slowly, \"how are you named and what is your\nfamily?\"\n\n\"My name is Lura, Your Excellency,\" she faltered, \"and I am the daughter\nof Turgan, the Kildare of this province.\"\n\n\"You please me, girl,\" said the Viceroy. \"Dismiss your chariot and join\nme in mine. There is room in my seraglio for you.\"\n\nLura stared with horror at the huge Jovian and shrank back from his\nsensual gaze. Glavour gazed at her in astonishment and a deep scowl\nspread over his face.\n\n\"The prospect does not seem to please you, Daughter of Man,\" he said\nslowly. \"Perhaps the company of the Viceroy of Tubain, Ruler of the\nUniverse, is too lowly to please you and you desire more exalted\ncompany. Be careful that I do not have you stripped and given to the\npalace guards for their sport. Join me in my chariot.\"\n\nHe half rose and leaned forward to clasp her. Lura gave a cry of horror\nand sprang from her chariot to the ground on the side farthest from the\nvehicle of the Viceroy. Glavour leaped to his feet with a roar of rage\nand lunged after her. Before he had left his chariot, the hand of his\nequerry fell restrainingly on his shoulder. The Viceroy turned a\nrage-maddened face toward his minion.\n\n\"Seize that maiden, Havenner!\" he cried. \"As I live, she shall be\nsacrificed at the next games.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe equerry made no move to obey his superior's orders and Glavour's\nface grew purple with rage.\n\n\"Obey my orders or you shall join her as a sacrifice!\" he roared.\n\nThe equerry's face paled slightly and grew grim at the Viceroy's words\nbut no trace of fear appeared on his heavy countenance.\n\n\"Save your breath, Glavour,\" he said shortly, but in so quiet a voice\nthat no one but the Viceroy heard him. \"You may be head of the Sons of\nGod on this planet but your power does not extend to life and death over\nme, who am of the same blood that you are. I have the right to appeal to\nTubain from such a sentence. Before you strive to haul that girl away to\nyour already crowded seraglio against her will, listen to me. Do you\nrealize who she is?\"\n\nThe Viceroy's face was a study. For a moment rage predominated and he\nraised a mighty fist to strike Havenner down, but the equerry looked him\nfearlessly in the eye. Slowly the hot rage faded and a deadly ferocity\ntook its place.\n\n\"You try me far, Havenner,\" he said in a quiet voice, yet with a hint of\nsteel in his tones, \"yet your loyalty is above suspicion. Heard you not\nthe girl say she was the daughter of the Kildare of this province?\"\n\n\"I heard, Your Excellency,\" replied the equerry, \"but beyond that, she\nis someone else. She is the affianced bride of Damis, the son of Hortan,\nwho was Viceroy before you.\"\n\n\"A Nepthalim!\" exclaimed the Viceroy scornfully. \"What matters that? Are\nthe desires of a half-breed bastard to stand above the wishes of the\nruler of the planet?\"\n\n\"It is true that the mother of Damis was a Daughter of Man,\" said the\nequerry quietly, \"yet Hortan married her in honor. Damis is a man of\ngreat influence and it would be well to reflect before you rob him of\nhis chosen bride. There is wide discontent with our rule which needs\nonly a leader to flare up. Remember that we are few and Jupiter is far\naway.\"\n\n\"Havenner, you talk like a frightened woman,\" sneered the Viceroy. \"Let\nhim join the ranks of the malcontents. For my part, I hope they revolt.\nThey need to be taught a lesson. Stand aside while I seize the maiden.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe equerry stood aside with a shrug of his shoulders and the Viceroy\nsprang to the ground. The girl had run as rapidly as her clinging robes\nwould allow toward one of the beautiful buildings which lined the\nthoroughfare. She had almost reached the doorway before Glavour reached\nthe ground and raced after her. His Jovian muscles carried his body\nforward at a pace which no Terrestrial could equal. It was evident to\nthe watchers that he would seize Lura before she could reach the\nsanctuary she sought.\n\nA mingled chorus of cries of rage and hisses came from the Earthmen who\nwitnessed the scene. The Jovian guards strove to suppress the outcries\nuntil a word from Havenner made them cease their efforts and close in\naround the Viceregal chariot. The cries rose to a tumult but as yet none\nof the Earthmen dared to raise a hand against the person of the\nrepresentative of Tubain, the far-off Jovian whom they had been forced\nto acknowledge as God, and whom many of the ignorant believed _was_ God.\n\nThe Viceroy rapidly overtook his victim and his hand was outstretched to\ngrasp her when there came an interruption. From the doorway which the\ngirl had been striving to reach, a man burst forth and leaped between\nher and her pursuer. Glavour stopped and glowered at the new obstacle in\nthe path of his sensuality.\n\nThe newcomer stood five inches over six feet in his flat sandals but it\nwas only in his unusual height and his enormous strength that he showed\nthe blood of his Jovian father. His feet were small and shapely with a\nhigh-arched instep and his whole form was graceful and symmetrical.\nCrisply curling yellow hair surmounted a head which Praxiteles would\nhave reveled in as a model for his youthful Hermes. As he faced the\nViceroy, his usual pleasant smile was gone and his face was set in grim\nlines, his clear blue eyes as cold as the ice brought from the polar\nregions to cool the Viceroy's drink.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe two stood and stared at one another, the black eyes of the Jovian\nburning like fire in strange contrast to the cold glare of the blue\nones. Then tension in the street grew taut. The Earthmen gradually\nclosed in about them. At a word from Havenner, the Jovian guards closed\nup and drew from their garments long black tubes. Presently Glavour\nbroke the silence.\n\n\"Make way, son of Hortan, for the Viceroy of God,\" he rumbled in his\ndeep-toned voice.\n\nDamis made no reply, nor did he move a muscle. The rage deepened on the\nViceroy's face and he strode forward, his hand raised to strike down\nthis puny assailant who had interposed his slight form between the\nmassive limbs of the Jovian and the object of his desires. With a cry of\nrage he brought down his huge hand and then Damis moved. So swiftly\nthat the eye could hardly follow his movements, he leaped to one side\nand his own hand shot up. Fingers of steel circled the hairy wrist of\nthe Viceroy and stopped his hand in mid-air. For a moment Glavour was\ntoo astonished at the idea of physical resistance to move. Damis, with\nan almost contemptuous air, tossed aside the hand he held and made as if\nto turn his back. With an inarticulate roar of rage, the Jovian charged.\n\nAgain Damis sprang to one side and his hand moved. In a long arc his\nclenched fist shot up and caught Glavour on the chin and rocked the four\nhundred pounds of bone and muscle that made up the Viceroy. For a moment\nGlavour staggered and then his hand fell on Damis' shoulder. Exerting\nall of his huge strength, he pulled his opponent toward him and threw\nhis massive arms about him. Damis made no attempt to wriggle out of the\nbone-crushing grip, but, instead, threw his arms about the Jovian and\nmatched muscle against muscle. The Jovian guards, who had witnessed the\nfeats of strength which were the Viceroy's boast, expected only one\noutcome, but to Havenner, who recalled that Hortan, the father of Damis,\nhad been one of the mightiest men of Jupiter, the issue was not a\nforegone conclusion. Stealthily as a cat he crept forward, a long black\ntube clenched in his hand.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nMightily the two strove. The face of the Jovian grew dark red and then\nalmost purple as he put forth his last ounce of strength to crush the\nopponent whom he topped a good eighteen inches. For all of his effort,\nnot an inch did Damis yield. His face grew as pale as the Jovian's grew\nred and his breath came whistling through his lips, but the strength he\nhad inherited from his mighty sire stood him in good stead. Inch by inch\nhe bent the huge form of his opponent backward. With a sudden effort,\nthe Jovian raised one of his huge misshapen feet and strove to bring his\nmighty thighs to aid him in thrusting away his enemy. Damis' knee came\nup and the Jovian dropped his foot with a howl of pain. His breath came\nin gasps and he stared into the implacable blue eyes before him with a\nsudden spasm of fear. At last Glavour had met his match.\n\nHe opened his lips to call to his guards for help but shame held back\nthe cry. Once he admitted defeat, the fear in which the Earthmen held\nhim would be shaken. With an effort he bent forward his head and buried\nhis huge fangs in Damis' shoulder. There was a cry from the watching\nEarthmen as they surged forward. The Jovian guards ran to their ruler's\nassistance but they were too far away. Havenner was close and he sprang\nforward, thrusting the black tube which he carried, toward Damis.\n\nA cry advised Damis of his danger. With a herculean effort he lifted the\nhuge Jovian from his feet and swung him around until the massive body\nwas between him and the threatening weapon of the equerry. As swiftly as\nstriking snakes his arms uncoiled from around Glavour's body and grasped\nhim by the shoulders. With one mighty heave he tore the Jovian's mouth\nfrom his shoulder although the flesh was torn and lacerated by the\naction. One arm went under Glavour's arm and back around until the hand\nrested on the back of his neck. The other arm caught the Viceroy's arm\nand twisted it behind his back. Glavour gave a cry of pain as the\npunishing hold was applied. Holding his captive before him, Damis\nturned to the equerry.\n\n\"Put up your tube,\" he said. \"One hostile move and your ruler dies.\"\n\n\"Disintegrate him, Havenner!\" gasped the Viceroy.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe equerry hesitated a moment but aid was at hand. The Jovian guards\nhad come up to the scene of the struggle and surrounded the pair, black\ntubes in their hands. The sight of reinforcements roused the Viceroy's\nlagging courage.\n\n\"Capture him alive!\" he gasped. \"He will be sacrificed at the next\ngames!\"\n\nWith a roar the guards closed in on the struggling pair. As hairy hands\ngrasped his shoulders, Damis lunged back with all his strength. There\nwas the crack of a breaking bone and the Viceroy's arm hung dangling and\nuseless. Damis whirled on the guards, shaking himself loose for a moment\nfrom their grasp, and his fists flew out. Two of the giants went down\nbefore well-aimed blows but no one man, no matter what his might, could\nfight against a score of the huge Jovians and Damis was borne to the\nground. Even as he fell, a roar went up from the watching Terrestrials\nand with one accord they closed in to attack.\n\nThe Jovian guards who were nearest whirled about and raised the black\ntubes threateningly. For a moment the Earthmen hesitated and then came\non with a rush. From the tubes came rays of intensely violet light. As\nthey fell on the front ranks of the charging Terrestrials, the form, on\nwhich the rays impinged grew suddenly tenuous. The sunlight penetrated\nthrough the bodies for a moment and then there was nothing but a group\nof dancing motes of light to mark where they had stood.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nUndaunted by the fate of their leaders, the balance of the mob surged\nforward uttering cries of hate and rage. From all the doorways, fresh\nhordes of Earthmen came rushing to join the fray. Again and again the\nterrible rays of the Jovian guards blasted scores of their assailants\ninto nothingness but more came. Presently the tubes of the Jovians began\nto lose their power and the violet light became lighter in shade. With a\nroar the Earthmen swept forward and the huge guards went down under the\nonrushing waves of humanity. Half a dozen of them were dragged down and\nhurled back into the milling crowd where they were torn limb from limb.\nThe balance of the guards, guided by Havenner's stentorian shouts,\nclosed in around Glavour and the prisoner and battered their way by\nsheer brute force toward the Viceregal chariot. They had reached in and\nclimbed in when a feminine shout pierced the din of conflict.\n\n\"Damis! They have Damis prisoner! Rescue him!\"\n\nWith a roar, the mob charged again. Mightily the Jovians strove but they\nwere outnumbered by hundreds to one. One after another was torn from the\nchariot until Damis freed himself by a mighty effort and leaped to the\nground. As he did so, the driver's hand found the controlling lever and\nthe chariot shot forward, crushing under its wheels several luckless\nEarthmen who stood in its path. A roar of triumph rose from the crowd\nand Damis was hastily lifted to their shoulders. He looked down on his\nrescuers with an anguished face.\n\n\"Lura!\" he gasped. \"Is she safe?\"\n\nOne of the Terrestrials shouted something unintelligible and pointed up.\nDamis' gaze followed the direction in which he pointed. From an upper\nwindow of the building into which she had fled, Lura's face, wreathed\nwith smiles, looked down on him. He smiled and waved in triumph to her.\nThere was a stir on the outskirts of the crowd and an elderly man, tall\nfor an Earthman and with dignity and authority written large on his\ncountenance, made his way through the crowd. At a word from him, Damis\nwas lowered to his feet to face the newcomer.\n\n\"Damis,\" said the elderly man, \"I never thought to grasp the hand of a\nNepthalim or of anyone with Jovian blood in his veins in friendship, yet\nI can do no less than offer my hand. It is the thanks of a father to the\nsaviour of his daughter.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nDamis met the outstretched hand with a grip that made the elderly man\nwince.\n\n\"It is an honor and a pleasure to grasp in friendship the hand of\nTurgan, the Kildare of this province,\" he said, \"the hand of one who was\nborn to be ruler in fact, instead of an underling under a Jovian\nmaster.\"\n\n\"It is true that my father was king of this country before the Jovians\ncame, forty years ago,\" said Turgan gravely, \"yet now there is no honor\nor merit in it. Even the rank of Kildare, which is but that of a slave\nruling other more unfortunate slaves, could not have prevented my only\ndaughter from being dragged away to the seraglio of that monster. To\nsuch a pass has one been brought whose birth made him the peer of any.\nBut now we must plan and plan swiftly, else are we undone. Glavour will\nreturn with his minions. Safety will be found only in flight, for mere\nnumbers cannot oppose the weapons they will turn against us. Damis, so\nfar you have been one with our Jovian masters, as have all of the\nNepthalim. Now it is war to the death between them and us. On which side\ndo you stand?\"\n\nDamis hesitated as the Kildare's keen gray eyes bored into his own.\n\n\"My father was Viceroy of the Earth in the days gone by,\" he said\nslowly, \"and he planned that I should take his place. His dream was a\npeaceful union of the strength and science of Jupiter with the beauty\nand humanity of the Earth. True to his dream, I have cleaved to his\npeople and striven to bring it about, but I can see now the folly of his\nambition. In stature and mental power he was a Jovian, in all else he\nwas a Terrestrial. Since his death I have seen you stripped bit by bit\nof what he left you until now you are lower than the slaves on Jupiter,\nwho can appeal to Tubain against a cruel master. Even I, a Nepthalim,\nthe son of a Viceroy, am forced to revolt to save the maiden I love.\nHenceforth, I give up my father's dream of peace and do what my heart\ntells me is right. It is war to the death between the Sons of God and\nthe Sons of Man, and I, who am descended from a Son of God and a\nDaughter of Man, cleave to my mother's people.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nA shout of joy came from all who heard his ringing voice announce his\nnew allegiance. Damis had ever a reputation as a humane man and he was\nguilty of none of the brutalities which made the Jovians so detested and\nwhich were bettered by those of the Nepthalim who had the power. It was\nonly the influence which Damis had wielded with the Earthmen which had\nprevented many an outbreak which would have been ruthlessly crushed by\nthe Jovian overlords. To know that the son of a Viceroy, reputed one of\nthe most brilliant as well as one of the strongest of Jovian blood, was\none with them, made them hope that they might make some headway against\ntheir oppressors and wring from them some small measure of liberty.\nTurgan's face was wreathed with smiles.\n\n\"Again I offer you my hand, Damis,\" he said. \"Before it was as a father\nthanking you for the rescue of his daughter. Now it is a father\nwelcoming the son he has always longed for and whom he feared he would\nnever have. My consent to your union with Lura which was grudgingly\ngiven only to save her from the dishonor of being dragged a slave to\nGlavour's seraglio, is withdrawn, and in its place I give you a happy\nfather's joyous consent to the marriage.\"\n\nThere were tears in the old Kildare's eyes as he grasped the hand of the\nyoung blond giant. For a moment they stood with clasped hands, two\nstrong men taking the measure of one another and each found the other\ngood. The Kildare dropped Damis' hand and turned to the crowd.\n\n\"To your homes!\" he cried sharply. \"The Sons of God will return with new\nweapons and it is my wish that none be found to oppose them. All within\nsound of my voice who are members of the inner council will join me in\nthe palace. Damis, come with me.\"\n\nFollowed by Damis and a score of Earthmen, the Kildare led the way into\na building. As they entered, Damis cast a swift glance around and looked\nquestioningly at Turgan.\n\n\"Lura--?\" he asked hesitantly.\n\n\"Will join us in the council room,\" said Turgan with a smile.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_Turgan's Plan_\n\n\nContent with the Kildare's answer, Damis followed him down a corridor\nand into a large room set around with benches. The Kildare did not pause\nbut moved to the far end of the room and manipulated a hidden switch. A\nportion of the paneled wall swung inward and through the doorway thus\nopened, Turgan led the way. The corridor in which they found themselves\nwas dimly lighted by radium bulbs which Damis shrewdly suspected had\nbeen stolen from the palace of the Viceroy by Earthmen employed there.\nIt sloped steeply downward and Damis estimated that they were fifty feet\nbelow the level of the ground before another door opened to Turgan's\nmanipulation of hidden catches and admitted them to a large room\nequipped with tables and chairs and well lighted by other radium bulbs.\nDamis turned to the Kildare.\n\n\"For years there have been rumors among the Sons of God of the existence\nof this place,\" he exclaimed, \"yet every effort to find it has been\nfutile. Glavour and his council have at last decided that it is merely a\nmyth and that the underground council chamber does not exist. You have\nkept your secret well, for never has a breath of suspicion reached him\nthat Turgan was one of the conspirators who plotted to overthrow the\nreign of the Sons of God.\"\n\n\"Let that, Damis, be a sample of the earnestness and loyalty of your new\nbrethren,\" said the Kildare. \"There are hundreds of Earthmen who know\nwhere this place is and what secrets it holds, yet none has ever\nbetrayed it. Scores have gone to torture and to the sacrifice of the\ngames without unsealing their lips. Would a Jovian have done likewise?\"\n\n\"To give them due credit, I think they would have,\" replied Damis\nthoughtfully, \"yet their motive would not have been loyalty, but\nstubbornness and a refusal to subordinate their will to another's. I\nthought you said that Lura would join us here?\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Damis spoke a door on the far side of the chamber opened and a half\ndozen women entered. Lura was among them and with a cry of joy, she ran\nlightly forward and threw herself into Damis' outstretched arms. Turgan\nsmiled paternally at them for a moment and then touched his daughter\nlightly on the shoulder.\n\n\"I have freely and gladly given my blessing to your union with Damis,\"\nhe said. \"He is now one with us. His presence makes victory possible and\nenables us to act at once instead of planning for years. Damis, you can\noperate a space flyer, can you not?\"\n\n\"Certainly. That is knowledge which all Nepthalim possess.\"\n\nA suppressed cheer greeted his words and the Earthmen crowded around\nhim, vibrant with excitement.\n\n\"The time is at hand!\" cried a stern-faced man in the crimson robe which\nmarked him an Akildare, an under-officer of the Earthmen.\n\n\"Before I can operate a space flyer, I will have to have one to\noperate,\" objected Damis.\n\n\"That will be supplied,\" cried a dozen voices. Turgan's voice rose above\nthe hubbub of sound.\n\n\"Let us proceed in orderly fashion,\" he cried.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe noise died down to silence and at a gesture from their ruler, the\nEarthmen took seats. Turgan stood beside Damis.\n\n\"For the enlightenment of our new-found brother, I will recite what has\nhappened and what we have done, although most of you know it and many of\nyou have done your part in bringing it about.\n\n\"Forty years ago, the Earth was prosperous, peopled with free men, and\nhappy. While we knew little of science and lived in mere huts, yet we\nworshipped beauty and Him who ruled all and loved his children. It was\nto such a world that the Jovians came.\n\n\"When the first space flyer with a load of these inhuman monsters\narrived on the earth, we foolishly took them for the angels whom we had\nbeen taught to believe spent eternity in glorifying Him. We welcomed\nthem with our best and humbly obeyed when they spoke. This illusion was\nfostered by the name the Jovians gave themselves, the 'Sons of God.'\nHortan, their leader and the father of our new brother, was a just and\nkindly man and he ruled the earth wisely and well. We learned from them\nand they learned from us. That was the golden age. And the Sons of God\nsaw that the Daughters of Man were fair, and they took of them wives,\nsuch as they chose. And sons were born to them, the Nepthalim, the\nmighty men of the Earth.\n\n\"In time other flyers came from the heavens above and brought more of\nthe Sons of God to rule over us. Then Hortan, the Viceroy, died, and\nDamis, know you how he died? You were a babe at the time and you know\nnothing. Your father and your mother, who was my distant kinswoman, died\nunder the knives of assassins. It was given out that they had gone to\nJupiter, yet there were some who knew the truth. You, the killers\nsought, but one of the Earthmen whose heart bled for your dead mother,\nspirited you away. When you had grown to boyhood, he announced your name\nand lineage, although his life paid for his indiscretion. The same hand\nwhich struck down your father and your mother struck at him and struck\nnot unavailingly. You, since all knew your name and lineage, he dared\nnot strike, lest those who love him not, would appeal to Tubain. Know\nyou the name of the monster, the traitor to his ruler and the murderer\nof your parents?\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nDamis' face had paled during the recital and when the old Kildare turned\nto him, he silently shook his head.\n\n\"It was the monster who now rules over us as Viceroy and who profanes\nthe name of God by conferring it on his master and who would, if he\ndared, assume the name for himself. It was Glavour, Viceroy of the\nEarth.\"\n\nThe blood surged back into Damis' face and he raised a hand in a\ndramatic gesture.\n\n\"Now I vow that I will never rest until he lies low in death and this be\nthe hand that brings him there!\"\n\nA murmur of applause greeted Damis' announcement and Turgan went on with\nhis tale.\n\n\"With the kind and just Hortan dead, Glavour assumed the throne of\npower, for none dared oppose him. Once secure, he gave way to every\nbrutal lust and vice. Your mother was Hortan's only wife and he honored\nher as such, and meant that the Nepthalim should in time rule the Earth,\nbut Glavour had no such ideas. To him, the Daughters of Man were\nplaythings to satisfy his brutal lusts. By dozens and by scores he swept\nthe fairest of them into his seraglio, heeding not the bonds of\nmatrimony nor the wishes of his victims. Only the fact that my daughter\nhas been kept from his sight until to-day has spared her.\n\n\"The Earthmen who had been content to live under Hortan's rule, rebelled\nagainst Glavour but the rebellion was crushed in blood. Time and again\nthey rose, but each time the mighty weapons of the Jovians stamped out\nresistance. At last we realized that craft and not force must win the\nbattle. This chamber had been built when Hortan erected his new capital\nand none of the Jovians knew of its location, so it was chosen as our\nmeeting place. To-day, Damis, I have twenty thousand men sworn to do my\nbidding and to rise when I give the word. Many thousands more will rise\nwhen they see others in arms and know that again the Sons of Man stand\nin arms against the Sons of God.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"There are less than a thousand Jovians and perhaps twice that number of\nNepthalim on the Earth, yet that handful would stand victorious against\nall the Earthmen living,\" said Damis thoughtfully. \"Even I, and I am a\nNepthalim, do not know the secret weapons in the arsenal of Glavour, but\nI know that they are more powerful than anything we have ever seen.\nForget not, too, that a radio message to Jupiter will bring down ships\nwith hundreds, nay, thousands, of her fighting men with weapons to\noverwhelm all opposition.\"\n\n\"Such was the case but it is so no longer since we number you among us,\"\nreplied the Kildare. \"Earthmen are employed in the communications net\nwhich the Jovians have thrown around the Earth and it is but a step from\nthose machines to the huge one with which they talk to their mother\nplanet. My spies have been busy for years and our plans are all laid.\nThere is one planet which all the forces of Jupiter have never been able\nto conquer; from which their ships have ever retreated in defeat.\"\n\n\"Mars!\" exclaimed Damis.\n\n\"Exactly,\" replied Turgan. \"The Martians are a peaceful and\njustice-loving people, yet they know that peace is given only to those\nwho are ready and able to fight for it. Ages ago they perfected weapons\nbefore which the Jovians fly, if they are not destroyed. I have\ncommunicated with the Grand Mognac of Mars and laid our plight before\nhim. He has pledged his aid and has promised us enough of his weapons to\nnot only destroy the Jovians and the Nepthalim on the Earth, but also to\nprevent other Jovian ships from ever landing. The only problem has been\nhow to get them here. The Martians, not desiring conquest and content\nwith their own planet, have never perfected space flyers. They have\npromised us the weapons, but we must go to Mars and bring them here.\nEnough can be transported on one of the Jovian ships.\"\n\n\"How will we get a ship?\" asked Damis.\n\n\"That also has been solved. There are two Jovian ships kept on the\nEarth, ready for instant flight to Jupiter. They are loosely guarded for\nthe Sons of God believe that we have no idea of how to operate them. We\ncan capture one of them whenever we desire, but so far such action would\nhave been useless. Little by little we have gathered bits of information\nabout the flyers, but we had expected to wait for years before our\nventure would have a chance of success. We dared not try prematurely,\nfor one attempt will be all that we will ever get. Now we are ready to\nstrike. You can fly the ship to Mars and back and with the Martian\nweapons, we can sweep the Jovians from the Earth.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nDamis' eyes lighted as Turgan spoke.\n\n\"Your plans are good,\" he cried, \"and I will fly the ship for you. In\nreturn I ask but one thing: let mine be the hand which strikes Glavour\ndown.\"\n\n\"If it can be so done, yours shall be the hand, oh Nepthalim!\" cried the\nAkildare who had first spoken of the ship. Turgan bowed his head and a\nmurmur of assent came from the assembled council.\n\n\"And now for action!\" cried Turgan. \"There is no need to talk longer.\nYears ago our plans were perfected for the capture of the space ship and\neach knows the part assigned to him. Toness, the Akildare, will rule\nduring my absence, for I will command the ship, under Damis. Twelve of\nour men who know all that we have been able to learn will make up the\ncrew. None of them will take any part in the capture of the ship for\nmany lives may be lost in that venture and we will need the instructed\nmen to operate the ship after we capture it. Damis, have you any\naddition to make to our plans?\"\n\n\"Only one, Turgan. Glavour will ransack the Earth rather than be cheated\nof one he has marked for his prey. Lura will be safe nowhere on Earth.\nHer capture by the Sons of God will discourage the timid who will say\nthat if Turgan cannot protect his own daughter, how can he free the\nEarth? She must go with us.\"\n\n\"Your point is well taken, Damis,\" replied the Kildare. \"She shall go.\nNow to action! Monaill, are your men ready?\"\n\n\"They will assemble at my signal, oh, Kildare.\"\n\n\"Give the signal, for nothing will be gained by delay. We will follow\nbehind while you capture the ship.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nMonaill bowed before the Kildare and hastened from the council room. In\na few words Turgan gave to Toness the final orders for the conduct of\nthe conspiracy during his absence. Followed by Lura, Damis and three of\nthe council, he made his way to a hidden doorway. Along an underground\npassage they made their way for a quarter of a mile. A group of figures\nwas seen dimly ahead of them and nine men joined the party. Turgan\nidentified them to Damis as the balance of the crew.\n\n\"Has Monaill passed this way?\" he asked.\n\n\"He passed with his band a few moments ago, oh, Kildare,\" replied one of\nthe men. \"See, there is the light which summons us to follow.\"\n\nHe pointed to a tiny light which had suddenly flashed into brilliance.\nTurgan nodded and led the way forward. At another doorway which opened\nto Turgan's touch on a hidden lever, the party paused. An instant later\nthere came from a few hundred yards ahead of them a hoarse cry of alarm\nfollowed by the roar of a huge whistle.\n\n\"The battle has joined!\" cried Turgan. The others crouched, tense and\nmotionless. From ahead came the sound of battle. Violet light showed in\nshort intense flashes. It was evident that the Jovian guard of the space\nship was fighting valiantly to protect it. Shaking aside Turgan's\nrestraining hand, Damis crept slowly forward.\n\nTwo hundred yards from the spot where he left Turgan he came to a bend\nin the passage. The sound of battle came from just ahead. He crept\nforward and peered around the corner. The passage emerged from the\nground and gave way to a huge open space which he recognized as part of\nthe grounds of the Viceregal palace. Standing on a launching platform\nwas a Jovian space ship around which a battle raged.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nFive of the huge Jovians were battling furiously with a score of\nEarthmen. Three dead Jovians and a dozen crushed forms of Terrestrials\ntestified to the bitterness of the fight. The terrible black tubes of\nthe Jovians were exhausted and the battle was now being waged hand to\nhand, Jovian ax against Earthly sword. The Terrestrials were being\ngradually pressed back.\n\nA shout came from the distance and Damis could see a dozen Jovian guards\nhastening toward the scene of the fight, brandishing in their hands the\nterrible black tubes. He turned back and shouted to Turgan.\n\n\"Hasten!\" he cried. \"In a moment, Monaill and his men will be\noverthrown!\"\n\nWith a shout the crouching group of Terrestrials rushed toward him, but\nDamis did not wait. The oncoming Jovians were several hundred yards away\nwhen he threw himself into the fray. At his appearance, a cry of dismay\nwent up from the Earthmen which was changed to one of mingled wonder and\ntriumph as Damis seized the nearest Jovian and bore the fellow down\ndespite his struggles. It was a matter of seconds for him to break the\nbull neck of the huge guard and he turned to grasp another. The four\nremaining Jovians backed away but Damis was not to be denied. He rushed\nin and grasped another about the waist, avoiding the swing of the\nforty-pound ax, and dragged him back. The swords of the Terrestrials\npierced the struggling guard from the rear and Damis rushed toward the\nthree survivors.\n\nHeartened by his aid, the remnants of Monaill's band charged with him.\nTwo of the Jovians fell before the swords of the Earthmen and the third\nwent down before a blow of Damis' fist. As he turned back to the ship,\nTurgan, followed by the crew of the ship, dashed up.\n\n\"Into the ship!\" cried Damis. A glance showed that the Jovian guards\nwere less than two hundred yards away and were coming on in huge leaps.\nThe door of the space ship was open and the band of Terrestrials\nclambered in.\n\n\"Quick, Damis!\" came Lura's voice.\n\nThe Nepthalim turned to enter but his gaze fell on the six survivors of\nMonaill's band.\n\n\"In with you!\" he cried sharply.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Terrestrials hesitated but Damis grasped the nearest of them by the\nbelt and threw him bodily into the ship. The others hesitated no longer\nbut clambered in. The Jovians were less than fifty yards away and\nalready deep violet flashes began to come from the tubes they carried.\nDamis stooped and grasped one of the dead Jovians. With an effort\npossible to only two men on Earth, himself and Glavour, he raised the\nbody above his head and hurled it straight at the oncoming Jovians. His\naim was true and three of them were swept from their feet. With a mighty\nbound, Damis sprang through the door of the space ship and the airlock\nclanged shut behind him.\n\nThe crew of the ship were already in place, awaiting orders. There was\nno time for instruction and Damis leaped to the control board. He pulled\na lever far down and in an instant the entire crew was flat on the floor\nas though an enormous weight had pressed them down. With a superhuman\neffort, Damis raised himself enough to cut off the power. The ship shot\non through the rapidly thinning air, its sides glowing a dull red. The\nheat inside the ship was almost intolerable.\n\nAs the pressure of the enormous acceleration ceased, the bruised\nTerrestrials struggled to their feet. Damis turned to another lever and\na breath of icy air swept through the ship.\n\n\"This will help for an instant,\" he gasped, \"and the cold of space will\nsoon cool us down. I had to give the ship a tremendous start or the\ntubes of the Sons of God would have reduced us to elemental atoms. Keep\naway from the walls and don't exert yourselves. I can handle the ship\nalone for the present.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor half an hour the ship charged on through space. Damis presently\npulled the control lever down and placed the ship under power. The walls\nchanged from dull red to black and the temperature in the ship grew\nnoticeably lower. Damis made his way to one of the walls and tested it\nwith a moistened finger.\n\n\"It's cool enough to touch,\" he announced. \"Fortunately the insulating\nvacuum between the inner and the outer skins was at its maximum,\notherwise we would have been roasted alive. The external wall was almost\nat the fusing point. We can move around now.\"\n\nHe posted lookouts at the observing instruments with which the ship was\nequipped and instructed them in their duties and the manipulation of the\ninstruments. He placed one man at the control lever of the stern\nrocket-motors. As he turned away from the control board he saw Lura\nstanding quietly in a corner. He opened his arms and she ran to them\nwith a cry of joy.\n\n\"Oh, Damis, I was so afraid for you,\" she gasped, \"and I wanted to hug\nyou when you jumped in and Father closed the lock behind you but I knew\nthat you had to take care of the ship. Were you hurt at all?\"\n\n\"Not a bit, darling,\" he assured her, \"but it was touch and go for a\nmoment. I didn't know whether the guards would dare to disintegrate the\nship without orders from Glavour. In any event, the blasts of the stern\nmotors must have hurled them half a mile. No strength could stand the\nblast of gas to which they were subjected. Are you all right?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" she replied; \"I never was in any danger. I was the first\none in the ship and the only chance I had to be hurt was to have you\novercome and the ship recaptured. In that case, I had this.\"\n\nShe displayed a small dagger which she drew from the bosom of her robe.\nDamis shuddered and took the weapon from her.\n\n\"Poisoned,\" he exclaimed as he glanced at its tip. \"You had better let\nme take care of it. You might fall and prick yourself with it.\"\n\nShe surrendered the weapon to him with a smile and Damis placed it in a\ncabinet built against the wall of the flyer.\n\n\"Now go in and lie down,\" he told her. \"I've got to start plotting a\ncourse to Mars and teaching my crew how to operate the ship.\"\n\n\"Can't I learn, too?\" she objected. \"If anything should happen, it might\nbe quite a useful bit of knowledge. Besides, I already understand\ncelestial geography quite well and I may be able to help in the\nnavigation.\"\n\nDamis looked at her in surprise.\n\n\"You a celestial geographer?\" he asked in astonishment. \"Where did you\nlearn it?\"\n\n\"From my father. He was a famous heaven-master before the Jovians came\nand he taught me.\"\n\n\"That's excellent!\" cried Damis. \"I didn't realize we had so much\nknowledge at our command. Turgan, will you take charge of the navigating\nafter I plot a course? Lura can assist you. Now, the rest of you attend\nto my words and I'll teach you how to operate the rocket motors.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Jovian ship was built along very simple lines. Batteries of rocket\nmotors at the bow and stern and on each of the sides furnished both\nmotive and steering power. The Terrestrials were all chosen men and in\nthree hours Damis announced himself as satisfied with their ability to\noperate the ship under any normal conditions. With Turgan and Lura\nwatching and checking his calculations, he plotted a course which would\nintercept Mars on its orbit.\n\n\"Luckily, Mars is approaching us now,\" he said, \"and we won't have a\nstern chase, which is always a long one. We will be able to reach Mars,\nspend several days on it and return to Earth before ships can reach the\nEarth from Jupiter, even if they are already on the way, which is highly\nprobable. I'll turn the ship a little.\"\n\nUnder his direction, the crew turned the ship in its course until it was\nheaded for the point in space where Damis planned to intercept the red\nplanet. With the course set to his satisfaction, he gave orders for the\nstern motors to be operated at such a power as to give the highest\nacceleration consistent with comfort for the crew. There were no windows\nin the ship but two observers seated at instruments kept the entire\nheavens under constant observation. Damis motioned one of them to stand\naside and told Lura to take his place. She sat down before a box in\nwhich were set two lenses, eye-distance apart. She looked through the\nlenses and gave a cry of astonishment. Before her appeared the heavens\nin miniature with the entire galaxy of stars displayed to her gaze. In\nthe center of the screen was a large disk thickly marked with pocks.\n\n\"The moon,\" explained Damis. \"We are headed directly toward it now but\nwe'll shift and go around it. We'll pass only a few hundred miles from\nits surface, but unfortunately it will be between us and the sun and\nyou'll be able to see nothing. Look in the other observer.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nLura turned to the second instrument. A large part of the hemisphere was\nblotted out by the Earth which was still only a few thousand miles away.\nThe sun showed to one side of the Earth, but a movable disk was arranged\nin the instrument by means of which it could be shut off from the gaze\nof the observer. Despite the presence of the sun, the stars shone\nbrilliantly in the intense black of space.\n\n\"How fast are we traveling?\" asked Lura.\n\n\"It is impossible to tell exactly,\" he replied. \"I can approximate our\nspeed by a study of the power consumed in our stern motors and again I\ncan approximate it by a series of celestial observations, provided we do\nnot have to change our course while I am doing so.\"\n\n\"Isn't there some sort of an instrument which will tell you how fast we\nare going?\" she asked in astonishment.\n\n\"Unfortunately not. We are traveling through no medium which is dense\nenough to register on an instrument. Our course is not straight, but is\nnecessarily an erratic one as we are subject to the gravimetric pull of\nall of the celestial bodies. Just now the Earth supplies most of the\npull on us but as soon as we approach the moon, we will tend to fall on\nit and frequent sideblasts will be needed to keep us away from it. Once\nwe get up some speed that is comparable with light, we can measure by\ndirect comparison, but our speed is too low for that now.\"\n\n\"I saw you lay out your course, but how are we steering?\"\n\n\"The observer who works on the front instrument keeps a cross hair on a\nfixed star. When the curving of the ship deviates us more than five\ndegrees from our course, a side motor is turned on until we straighten\nout again. It is quite a simple matter and I'll take the ship myself\nwhen we near Mars. There is no need to be frightened.\"\n\n\"I'm not frightened,\" said Lura quickly; \"I was just curious. Is there\nany danger of hitting a wandering body?\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Not much in this zone and at this speed. When our speed picks up there\nwill be a slight danger because the higher our rate of speed, the more\ncrowded space becomes. If we were going to Jupiter we would have to use\nmuch more caution. The asteroid belt lying between Mars and Jupiter is\nreally crowded with small bodies but comparatively few are in the zone\nbetween Earth and Mars. That is one thing I figured on when I said that\nwe would have plenty of time to go to Mars and back before ships could\ncome from Jupiter. Ships from Jupiter would be able to develop a much\nhigher speed than we will attain were it not for the asteroid belt. They\nwill have to travel quite slowly through it, in portions, not over a few\nthousand miles per minute, while we are not held down that way. Now that\nwe are really started, it will be best to set regular watches. I will\nassign you as navigator for one watch if you wish.\"\n\n\"I certainly do want to do my share.\"\n\n\"All right, we'll let it go that way. Turgan and I will take the other\ntwo watches until we get there.\"\n\n\"How soon will that be?\"\n\n\"About seventeen days. Mars happens to be only about forty million\nmiles away just now. Now I'll set the watches and divide the crew.\"\n\nA short examination showed Damis that his crew were intelligent and that\nhis instruction had been good. Every member knew his duties. Instead of\nthe two twelve-hour watches which were usual on space flyers, the\nadditional members of the crew who had been part of Monaill's band\nenabled Damis to set only eight-hour shifts. Each member of the crew was\ntaught to operate the offensive ray projectors with which the flyer was\nequipped.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThings soon settled down to routine. No wandering celestial bodies came\nclose enough to cause them any real alarm. Once the novelty of hurtling\nthrough space had passed away, the trip became monotonous. The Earth,\nwhich had at first filled the field of one of the observers, dwindled\nuntil it became merely a brilliant green star. The red speck which was\nMars grew constantly more prominent as the hours went by and Damis gave\nthe word to turn on the bow motors and retard the speed of the flyer.\nSeveral of the crew had worked in the communications net which Glavour\nhad thrown around the Earth and under orders from Turgan, they began to\ncall the red planet on the ship's communicator.\n\n\"It is well to let them know who we are,\" he said to Damis when he gave\nthe order. \"We are flying a Jovian ship and since we have come so far\nsuccessfully, I have no desire to be blasted out of space by their\npowerful weapons of defense.\"\n\nDamis agreed heartily, and for twelve hours continual attempts were made\nto communicate with their destination. At last their signals were\nanswered. Despite the differences in language, they had no trouble in\nunderstanding the messages. A system of communication based not on words\nor sound forms, but on thought forms, had been introduced to the Earth\nby the Jovians and both Damis and Turgan were quite familiar with it.\nThe Martians informed them that the approaching ship had been sighted\nand carefully watched for several days. As soon as he learned who the\noccupants were, the Grand Mognac of Mars sent a message of welcome and\ninstructed them on what part of the planet to land. He promised that a\ndeputation would meet them with transportation to his capital city where\nhe would welcome them in person and supply them with the weapons they\nsought.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_The Doom on Mars_\n\n\nTwo days later Damis dropped the ship gently to the ground in a wide and\ndeep depression which had been designated as their landing place. The\nGrand Mognac had assured them that the depression held enough atmosphere\nto enable them to breathe with comfort. There was no one in sight when\nthey landed and after a short consultation, Damis and Turgan entered the\nairlock. In a few moments they stood on the surface of Mars.\n\nThey had landed in a desert without even a trace of the most rudimentary\nvegetation. Barren slate-colored mountains shut off their view at a\ndistance of a few miles. When they strove to move they found that the\nconditions which had confronted the Jovians in their first landing on\nthe Earth were duplicated. The lesser gravity of the smaller planet made\ntheir strength too great for easy control and the slightest effort sent\nthem yards into the air. This condition had been anticipated and at a\nword from Damis, lead weights, made to clamp on the soles of their\nsandals were passed out from the space ship. Although this enabled them\nto keep their footing when moving over the dry surface of Mars, the\nslightest exertion in the thin air caused them acute distress.\n\n\"We had better save our strength until the messengers of the Grand\nMognac arrive,\" said Damis at length. \"We may have quite a trip before\nus.\"\n\nTurgan agreed and they sat down by the side of the ship where its shadow\nwould shield them from the fierce solar rays which beat down on them.\nThe sun looked curiously small, yet its rays penetrated the thin air\nwith a heat and fierceness strange to them. Lura and a half dozen of the\ncrew were passed through the airlock and joined them.\n\n\"I am surprised that the Martians have not arrived,\" said Damis\npresently. \"I am interested to see what their appearance is.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nHardly had he spoken than the air before them seemed to thicken in a\ncurious fashion. Lura gave a cry of alarm and pressed close to Damis.\nThe sun's rays penetrated with difficulty through a patch of air\ndirectly before them. Gradually the mistiness began to assume a nebulous\nuncertain outline and separated itself into four distinct patches. The\nthickening air took on a silvery metallic gleam and four metallic\ncylinders made their appearance. Two of them were about eight feet in\nheight and three feet in diameter. The other two were fully thirty feet\nin length and about the same diameter. On the top of each one was a\nprojecting cap shaped like a mushroom and from it long tenuous streamers\nof metal ran the full length of each cylinder. From the ether came a\nthought wave which registered on the brains of all the Terrestrials.\n\n\"The Grand Mognac of Mars sends his greeting and a welcome to the\nvisitors from Earth,\" the message ran. \"Before his envoys make their\nappearance before you, we wish to warn you to be prepared for a severe\nshock for their physical appearance is not that of the life with which\nyou are familiar. I would suggest that you turn your heads while we\nemerge from our transporters.\"\n\nObediently the Earthmen turned their gaze toward their ship until\nanother thought wave ordered them to turn. Lura gave a cry of horror and\nDamis instinctively raised one of the Jovian ray tubes. Before them were\nhuge figures which seemed to have stepped out of a nightmare, so\ngrotesque were their forms.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Martians had long slug-like bodies, twenty-five feet in length, from\nwhich projected a multiplicity of short legs. The legs on the rear\nportions of the bodies terminated in sucker-like disks on which they\nstood on the surface of the planet. The upper part of the body was\nraised from the ground and the legs terminated in forked appendages like\nhands. Stiff, coarse hair, brown in color, protruded from between\nbrilliant green scales, edged with crimson. The heads were huge and\nmisshapen and consisted mostly of eyes with a multitude of facets and\nhuge jaws which worked incessantly as though the slugs were continually\nchewing on something. Nothing that the Earth could show resembled those\nmonstrosities, although it flashed across Damis' mind that a hugely\nenlarged caricature of an intelligent caterpillar would bear some\nresemblance to the Martians. Another thought wave impinged on the\nconsciousness of the Terrestrials.\n\n\"Mars is much older than your planet and evolution has gone much farther\nhere than it has on the Earth. At one time there were forms of life\nsimilar to yours which ruled this planet, but as air and water became\nscarce, these forms gave way to others which were better suited to\nconditions as they existed. I would be pleased to explain further, but\nthe Grand Mognac anxiously awaits his guests. His orders are that two of\nyou shall visit him in his city. The two whom he desires to come are\nTurgan, the leader of the expedition and Damis, the Nepthalim. Fear\nnothing, you are among friends.\"\n\nDamis hesitated and cast a glance at Lura.\n\n\"By all means, Damis, do as the Grand Mognac bids you,\" she exclaimed.\n\"I will stay here with the ship until you return. I am not at all\nfrightened, for the whole crew will be here with me.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nDamis kissed her and after a word with Turgan, he announced their\nreadiness to proceed. He inquired the direction in which they should\ntravel, but another thought wave interrupted him.\n\n\"We have brought transportation for you,\" it said. \"Each of you will\nenter one of the smaller transporters which were especially prepared for\nyour use. When you enter them, seal them tightly and place your feet in\nthe stirrups you will find in them. Grasp the handles which will be\nbefore you firmly in your hands. In an instant you will be dissolved\ninto elemental atoms and carried on a beam of force to the receiving\nfocus where you will again be materialized. There is no danger and no\npain. It is our usual means of transportation.\"\n\nWith a final word of farewell to Lura and the crew, Turgan and Damis\nunfastened and entered the two smaller cylinders. Before the astonished\neyes of the Terrestrials the cylinders grew thin and vanished like a\npuff of smoke dissipating in a wind. Lura turned to Kastner whom Turgan\nhad left in command.\n\n\"What were my father's orders?\" she asked.\n\n\"Merely that we wait here until his return,\" he replied. \"Since we are\namong friends, there is no need to keep the ray projectors manned and I\nam anxious to let all of the crew have the experience of setting foot on\na new planet.\"\n\n\"I am a little tired,\" said Lura. \"I will return to the ship and rest\nwhile you let the crew try their footing on Mars.\"\n\nShe entered the airlock and in a few moments was again inside the ship.\nAt a word from Kastner the balance of the crew passed through the lock\nand began to amuse themselves by trying to keep their footing on the\nsurface of Mars.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nDamis and Turgan, having entered the transporters, slipped their feet in\nplace as the Martians had directed. They grasped firmly the handles\nwhich projected from the inside of the cylinders. There was a momentary\nsensation of slight nausea and then a thought wave reached them.\n\n\"You have arrived. Unfasten your cylinders and emerge.\"\n\nThey stepped out of the transporters and rubbed their eyes in\nastonishment. Two of the huge slugs had been amazing, but the effect of\nhalf a hundred grouped about them was more than the mind could, for a\nmoment, grasp. They were in a huge room composed apparently of the same\nsilvery material of which the transporters were made. It rose above\nthem in a huge dome with no signs of windows or openings. It was lighted\nby a soft glow which seemed to emanate from the material of the dome\nitself, for it cast no shadows. On a raised platform before them rested\none of the huge slugs, a broad band of silvery metal set with flashing\ncoruscating jewels clasped about its body. From the ornament and the\nexalted position, they judged that they were before the Grand Mognac of\nMars. With a muttered word to Turgan to follow him, Damis advanced to\nthe foot of the platform and bowed deeply.\n\n\"I thank you for that mark of respect, Nepthalim,\" came a thought wave\nfrom the Grand Mognac, \"but such forms are obsolete on Mars. Here all\nliving intelligences are equal. Only the accident of superior mental\npower is allowed to differentiate between us and this added power brings\nonly added and more arduous duties. You came here to get weapons which\nwill free you from the dominance of the Jovians who rule you, did you\nnot?\"\n\n\"We did, oh Grand Mognac,\" replied Damis.\n\n\"Your prayers shall be answered if you are found worthy. Relate to me\nnow all that has passed since the Jovians first landed on your planet.\nIf you can form thoughts without speaking, you may save the effort of\nspeech. The air has become so thin on Mars that sound will not carry\nover large portions of it. As a result, we have no organs of hearing,\nfor they have been atrophied from ages of disuse. We use thought as our\nonly means of communication.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nRapidly, Damis marshaled his thoughts in order. Slowly and carefully he\npictured in his mind the landing of the Jovians as he had heard it\ndescribed and then the event leading up to their trip. The Grand Mognac\nfrequently interrupted him and caused him to amplify in detail some of\nthe mental pictures and at times turned to Turgan and requested him to\npicture the same events. When Damis had finished the Grand Mognac was\nmotionless for ten minutes.\n\n\"Pardon me for sealing my thoughts from you,\" he said at length, \"but my\nconsultation with my councillors was not a matter for those from another\nplanet to know, no matter how friendly they may be. My council have\nagreed with me that your tale is a true one and has been fairly\npictured. We have no interest in the fate of your planet except that we\ndesire to help the form best adapted to bring about the day we all await\nwith anxiety when all of the planets will be united in bonds of love and\njustice. We believe that the form which developed on the Earth is better\nadapted to this than the form which developed on Jupiter and we will\ngive you weapons which will enable you to free yourselves and to protect\nyour planet against future invasions. My scientists are now busy\npreparing for you weapons which we will deliver to your ship. Meanwhile,\nyou are our honored guests. You will be interested in seeing life as it\nexists here and Attomanis, one of my council, will be your guide and\nwill answer your questions.\"\n\nThe Grand Mognac dropped the upper portion of his body to the dais as a\nsign that the interview was ended. Damis and Turgan hurriedly tried to\nform appropriate expressions of gratitude in their minds but a powerful\nthought wave took possession of their minds.\n\n\"Follow me,\" it said.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the caterpillars crawled forward and beckoned to them. With a\nbackward glance at the Grand Mognac who seemed unaware of their\nexistence, Damis and Turgan followed their guide. He led the way to a\nplatform upon which he slowly crawled. In answer to a thought command,\nTurgan and Damis climbed upon it and in an instant they were skimming at\nhigh speed over the ground. The platform came to a stop near the outer\nedge of the huge dome. They followed their guide from the platform to a\nbox-like contrivance built against the dome. It had lenses similar in\nappearance to the observers on the Jovian space ship but built on a\nlarger scale. Attomanis removed the lenses from the instrument and\nsubstituted two smaller pairs through which he motioned Turgan and Damis\nto look.\n\nBefore them lay a huge plain across which ran a belt of green foliage.\nThe vegetation forms were like nothing the earth could show. There were\nno true leaves but huge pulpy branches ran up into the air a hundred\nfeet and divided and subdivided until they became no larger around than\nhairs. At places on the plants were huge crimson, mauve and blue\nflowers, ten feet across. As they watched a monstrous form flitted into\nview. It was that of a butterfly, but such a butterfly as they had never\nimagined.\n\nThe spread of the huge wings was fully a hundred feet across and its\nswollen body was larger by far than the huge slug which stood beside\nthem. The butterfly waved its thirty-foot tentacles and approached one\nof the blue flowers. A long curled sucker, fifty feet in length,\nunrolled and was plunged down into the heart of the trumpet-shaped\nflower. Gradually the blue color faded to mauve and then to a brilliant\ncrimson. The butterfly abandoned it when the change of color was\ncompleted and flitted away to another of the blue blooms.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What manner of thing is that?\" demanded Damis.\n\n\"That was a member of the council,\" replied Attomanis. \"She was chosen\nto be one of those to perpetuate our race. Evolution has gone further\nwith us than on your planet but it will show you what in time you may\nexpect.\n\n\"Life started with an amoeba on Mars as it did on Earth and the slow\nprocess of evolution followed similar lines. At one time forms like\nyours were the ruling and guiding intelligences of Mars. They were,\nhowever, a highly specialized form. As conditions changed, the form\nchanged. The head and chest grew larger as the air grew thinner until\nthe enfeebled trunk and limbs could no longer support their weight.\nGradually the form died out and was replaced by others.\n\n\"The forms which you call insects on your Earth were more primitive and\nhardier forms and more readily adaptable. They increased in size and in\nintelligence until they were ready to supplant all other forms. The last\nvestiges of the bipeds were carefully nurtured and guarded by our\nforefathers until the vanishing atmosphere made their survival\nimpossible. The insect form became supreme.\n\n\"We multiplied with extreme rapidity and would have overcrowded the\nplanet had we not learned several things. Our present form of life is\nimmature in many ways. For example, we are totally unable to reproduce\nour kind. That is the function of the next phase. In this form, however,\nthe intelligence reaches its maximum. As a result, all living creatures,\nexcept selected ones, have their growth arrested at the larval stage and\npass their entire life in this form. Certain ones at long intervals of\ntime as the population diminishes, are allowed to spin cocoons and hatch\nout in the form you have witnessed. This form is almost brainless, the\nsecuring of nourishment from flowers and reproducing their kind being\nthe limits of their intelligence. The eggs are maturing in the body of\nthe one you saw. Soon she will lay many thousands of them and then, her\nlife mission accomplished, she will die. We will gather these eggs and\ntend them until they hatch. All defective ones will be destroyed and the\nbalance will be instructed until they are ready to take their place in\nthe community and carry on the work of the planet.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That is extremely interesting,\" exclaimed Damis. \"Will our Earth in\ntime support the same forms of life as does Mars now?\"\n\n\"I can see no reason why evolution should follow a different path there\nthan it has here,\" replied Attomanis, \"but millions of years will pass\nbefore you lose your atmosphere to such an extent as we have. All of our\nwater is gathered at the polar icecaps, from whence we lead it as it\nmelts through underground pipes hundreds of miles to the spot where we\ndesire vegetation to grow. There we deliver it directly to the roots of\nthe plants so there is no waste. Great bands of cultivated areas\ncrisscross the planet where the soil is of unusual fertility. A certain\nnumber of plants are allowed to flower and to bear fruit for the\nsustenance of the reproductive form of life and to replace themselves.\nThe others we devour while they are young and tender.\"\n\n\"Do you always live in these sealed cities?\"\n\n\"Always. There are hundreds of them scattered over the planet. As you\nhave noticed, they are composed of damazonium, the same substance as is\nused in making the transporters. The whole city is but a large\ntransporter. When we desire to feed, the city is disintegrated and\nmaterialized over a patch of vegetation which we eat. When the supply is\nfor a time exhausted, the city is moved. This is one way in which we\nconserve the small supply of atmosphere which is left.\"\n\nAttomanis suddenly paused and held up one hand for silence. In a moment\nthe thought waves again beat in on the consciousness of Damis and\nTurgan.\n\n\"The weapons which were promised you are ready,\" he said. \"We will\nreturn to the throne of the Grand Mognac and you will receive\ninstructions in their use.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe again mounted the platform and Damis and Turgan took their places\nbeside him. Rapidly they were borne over the ground until they came to a\nstop before the dais on which the Grand Mognac rested. Beside the four\ncylinders in which they and the Grand Mognac's messengers had traveled\nfrom the space ship to the city, another of huge proportions stood\nbefore the platform. Beside it were two instruments. From a mass of\ncoils and tubes a long rod projected up. It was pivoted so that it could\nbe directed toward any point. The rod on one of the instruments was blue\nwhile the other was a fiery scarlet.\n\n\"These are the weapons which will enable you to destroy your oppressors\nand prevent more from ever landing,\" said the Grand Mognac. \"I must\ncaution you, however, regarding their use. They generate a ray of almost\ninfinite frequency, much higher than the disintegrating ray the Jovians\nuse. Instead of resolving materials into light and energy, these devices\nwill absolutely destroy the ether, that imponderable substance which\npermeates and fills all space.\n\n\"Heat and light travel in waves through the ether. When it is destroyed,\nonly blackness and entire absence of heat remain. Nothing can bear the\ncold of interstellar space and yet it is warm compared to the absolute\ncold which the absence of ether produces. When you direct one of these\nrays toward a Jovian ship, the ether in the ship is destroyed. No\ninsulation against the cold of space will interfere for the ether\npenetrates and permeates all substance. The cold of absolute nothingness\nwill destroy all life in the twinkling of an eye and the ship will be\nreduced to a puff of powder. At such a temperature, even stellanium has\nless strength than the most brittle substance.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"There are two of these devices, set to different powers. The one with\nthe blue rod is for use against space ships either before or after they\nenter the atmosphere envelope. Beware of using it except when it points\nin a direction almost normal to the surface of your planet. These\ndevices tap and use the enormous force of gravity itself and when they\nare locked to your planet, they are anchored to the center of gravity of\nthe planet. Unless it were normal to the planet's surface, its reactive\nforce is so great that it would disrupt the balance which holds the\nplanet in place were the beam sent off on a tangential line.\n\n\"The other, whose projecting rod is painted red, can be used at any\nangle as its force is only a minute fraction of that of the other. It\nalso must be locked to the center of gravity of the earth before it is\nused by means of the switch on the front. This instrument will give you\npower to annihilate your oppressors on earth, for while it has not the\nterrible force of the other, it will penetrate any protective screen\nwhich the science of Jupiter can erect. Use it only against the Jovians\nand when you have finished with it, destroy it that it may not fall into\nthe hands of those who would misuse it. The other may be left intact to\nrepel other Jovian attacks but I think you need fear none. Once they\nlearn you have it, they will be content with their conquests of Venus\nand Mercury and give you a wide berth. The Jovians have had a taste of\nit already and they leave Mars alone. Each instrument is set in action\nby closing the switch on top, after closing the gravity anchor switch.\nTo stop them, open the top switch.\"\n\nUnder the direction of the Grand Mognac, the Martians placed the\nterrible weapons in the transporter prepared for them. Turgan and Damis\nstrove to thank the Grand Mognac for his gift but he interrupted them\npromptly.\n\n\"No thanks are due us,\" he said. \"We have done that which we believe is\nthe best for the orderly development of this galaxy of planets and there\nis no reason why we should be thanked. Now enter the transporters and\nyou will be returned to your space ship. Destroy your oppressors and\nwork for the day when Mars and Earth will march in peace toward the\nfinal goal of all life.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nAccompanied by two Martian envoys, Damis and Turgan entered the\ncylinders and fastened them closely. They set their feet in place and\ngrasped the handles before them. Again came the feeling of nausea and\nthen a thought ordered them to emerge from the transporters. They\nemerged almost at the same instant. Before them lay the space ship with\nits airlock wide open. Not a living soul was in sight. Damis leaped\ntoward the ship, but his foot struck an obstruction which sent him\nsprawling. He glanced down and a hoarse cry of alarm broke from his\nlips. He had stumbled over the body of Kastner. The body had been\nhorribly mutilated by some heavy instrument, one arm hanging to the\ntorso by a mere shred of flesh. Scattered around on the ground lay other\nmutilated bodies.\n\nWith a shout of anguish, Turgan sped toward the open space ship. Damis,\nwith a pale face, hastily examined the dead bodies. Eighteen of the\nTerrestrials lay stiff in death while the bodies of two huge Jovians in\nthe uniform of Glavour's personal guard told the cause of their death.\nDamis struck by a sudden apprehension, ran from one body to the next,\nand in a little while he straightened up with a momentary breath of\nrelief. Lura's body was not among them. He turned to the space ship in\ntime to see Turgan appear in the door of the airlock, his face distorted\nby grief and his tall body swaying. Damis hurriedly ran to him.\n\n\"Is Lura--dead?\"\n\nHe brought out the last word with an effort. Turgan's face worked for a\nmoment before he could reply. Through the thin air of Mars came his\nchoking voice.\n\n\"Worse,\" he muttered: \"she is gone!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration: Damis' fist caught him under the ear.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_Damis' Decision_\n\n\nDamis stared at Turgan for a moment as though unable to comprehend the\nold man's words.\n\n\"Gone?\" he repeated stupidly. \"She has slain herself?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the Kildare, his face still working in grief; \"she is gone\nfrom us. She has been captured by Glavour's minions.\"\n\n\"Her dagger--?\" asked Damis hesitatingly.\n\n\"Is gone with her,\" replied Turgan.\n\nThe Nepthalim started toward the space ship but a thought wave from one\nof the Martian envoys stopped him in mid-stride.\n\n\"Wait, Man of Earth,\" came the message. \"The heavens are eternally\nwatched by our people and none can enter or leave the vicinity of Mars\nunknown to us. My comrade is now inquiring of each of the observers\nwhence came the Jovians and where they have gone.\"\n\nTurgan and Damis waited impatiently. Presently the second Martian sent a\nthought wave to their minds.\n\n\"The Jovian ship approached Mars using Phobus, one of our moons, as a\nscreen to its movements. It was close to the planet before it was seen.\nWhen challenged, the ship sent a message saying that it was captained by\nToness, an Akildare of Earth and an enemy of the Jovians. The Grand\nMognac was engaged and the matter was referred to the Mozar of\nChinamonot, the nearest city. Thinking they were your followers, he\ndirected them to land here. The Grand Mognac is enraged beyond measure\nthat, after so many ages of failure, the Jovians have made a successful\nraid on our planet. The Mozar will pay for his indiscretion with his\nlife.\"\n\nA groan burst from Turgan's lips. Damis stood for a moment stricken with\ngrief, and then sprang in giant leaps toward the space flyer.\n\n\"Come, Turgan!\" he cried. \"We may overtake them yet. At least we can\navenge if we cannot save.\"\n\nThe Kildare followed him more slowly.\n\n\"Where, oh, Nepthalim,\" he asked, \"will we find them in the trackless\nwastes of space?\"\n\nDamis paused at the words.\n\n\"Why, between here and Earth,\" he replied. As he did so a thought\ncrossed his mind which was revealed by the sudden expression of dismay\nwhich clouded his features. \"Earth, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Jupiter--all\nare under the rule of the Sons of God,\" he cried.\n\n\"And to any of them, Glavour's ship may have fled,\" replied the Kildare.\n\"Before we start in pursuit, it is best to find, if we can, in what\ndirection the ship went.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrantically, Damis strove to muster his thoughts and hurl a question at\nthe two Martians who stood beside the transporter cylinders. Before the\nthought had been fully formed, an answer reached him.\n\n\"I have been inquiring, Nepthalim, why, when our observers saw that the\nship contained Jovians, they were not destroyed. One of the observers\nwho watched them tells me that their ship landed between your ship and\nthe only instruments of destruction which could be brought to bear on\nthem. The Jovians poured out and attacked your crew who were all out of\nthe ship. They were so mingled that it would have been impossible to\ndestroy them without encompassing the destruction of your men as well\nand we could not blast their ship into nothingness without also\ndestroying yours. When they rose again they carried one of your crew a\nprisoner and so they were not blasted out of the heavens. They took a\ncourse which carried them behind Phobus where they were shielded. When\nnext seen, they were headed away from your planet.\"\n\n\"If Glavour came to Mars, Lura is dead by now,\" said Turgan sorrowfully,\ntears coursing down his cheeks. \"Glavour is not one to await the\nfulfillment of his desires and Lura had her dagger. Her soul is now with\nHim whom we are taught to glorify. His will be done!\"\n\n\"If it be His will,\" replied Damis. \"Don't give up, Turgan, we may save\nher yet.\" He turned to the Martians and formed a thought message in his\nmind.\n\n\"Has your science any way of telling us who was in command of the Jovian\nship?\" he asked.\n\n\"Were your men who lie dead familiar with the features of the Jovian\nViceroy?\"\n\n\"Yes, all of them.\"\n\n\"Then we will search the brains of the dead. The pictures that are in\nthe living brain fade rapidly when death comes, but the last impression\nof these men was a powerful one of fighting and hatred and some traces\nmay remain. I will search.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe huge slug crawled over the ground to the body of the nearest dead\nTerrestrial. In one of his many hands he carried a shiny metal tube from\nwhich crimson rays flickered and played over the head of the dead man.\nThe skull disintegrated under the influence of the strange instrument\nuntil the brain lay naked and exposed to the fierce glare of the Martian\nsun. The Martian delicately connected two wires terminating in metal\nplates to the tissue of the brain and attached the other ends of the\nwires to a metal circlet which he clamped about his middle. For some\nmoments he remained motionless and then crawled to the body of the\nsecond dead Earthman. One after another he examined each of the eighteen\ndead bodies. When he had completed he crawled over to Damis and Turgan.\n\n\"Put these bands about your brows,\" he commanded in thought language as\nhe handed to each of them a metallic band similar to the one clasped\nabout him. The two Earthmen quickly adjusted the bands. \"Let your minds\nremain a blank and in them will be reproduced the impressions I have\ngathered from the brains of your dead followers.\"\n\nDamis sprang suddenly upward and smote with all of his force at the\nair. Out of nothingness had materialized the form of a huge Jovian clad\nin the uniform of Glavour's guards. His blow went harmless through the\nthin air and the Jovian swung a massive ax. Just before the blow landed\nthe Jovian disappeared and a thought wave from the Martian impinged on\nDamis' brain.\n\n\"Spare your energies, Nepthalim,\" the message said. \"What you saw was\nnot a Jovian but was the last impression stored in the brain of the man\nwho met his death under a blow of the ax which seemed to be striking at\nyou. I am merely reproducing in you the emotions and experiences that\nman felt. Had I allowed the phantom blow to land, you would now be cold\nin death, so great was the strength of the impression. Now make your\nmind again a blank and I will reveal to you what was in the mind of\nanother at the instant that his death came upon him.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore the Nepthalim's startled gaze, another Jovian appeared.\n\n\"Havenner!\" he cried as he recognized the principal officer of Glavour.\nThe equerry came forward slowly, blood dripping from a wound in his leg.\nHe swung his ax but it went wide of the mark. Again he struck, but two\nTerrestrials attacked him from the rear and he whirled. For a moment,\nDamis had a chance to watch the conflict which was raging about him.\nNine of the huge Jovians were engaged in deadly combat with a dozen of\nthe Terrestrials who still remained on their feet. In the door of the\nspace ship stood Lura, watching the conflict with frightened eyes. One\nafter another of the Earthmen were stricken down. Suddenly a Jovian\nrushed at Damis but the scene went blank before the raised ax could\nstrike him down.\n\n\"Have you seen enough or shall I show you the scenes in the brains of\nthe others?\" asked the Martian.\n\n\"I have seen and recognized nine of the Jovians,\" replied Damis, \"yet\namong them was not the one I feared. Let me see into the brains of the\nothers that I may be sure that Glavour was not among them.\"\n\nAnother scene materialized before him. It was merely a variation of\nthose he had already seen. In the brain of one of the Terrestrials he\nsaw the landing of the Jovian ship and the sudden outrush of the Sons of\nGod, armed only with the forty-pound axes they used at close quarters.\nIn none of the scenes did he see the huge form of Glavour. He removed\nthe band with a sigh of relief.\n\n\"I broke Glavour's arms a few days back,\" he said to Turgan, \"and it is\nprobable that that prevented him from following us, even if he felt that\nhe could leave the Earth in the turmoil which Toness had undoubtedly\nraised. It means that Lura is safe for the present, for Havenner would\nnot dare to do other than to bring her to the Viceroy. We must follow\nthem and endeavor to rescue her. I will ask our friends if they can plot\nher course for us.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I have inquired as to that,\" replied the Martian to Damis' unspoken\nquestion, \"and find we cannot. Soon after the ship left the surface of\nMars, our observers sighted a Jovian fleet of a hundred flyers in the\nasteroid belt between here and Jupiter. They are nearly through the belt\nnow and are headed toward your planet. Their path will bring them within\na few thousand miles of Mars and every instrument on the planet is\ntrained on them. While the Grand Mognac believes that Earth is their\ndestination, never before have the Jovians approached us in such force\nand it may be that Tubain will try to avenge his former defeats by an\nattack in force. We have no instruments to spare to keep track of a lone\nflyer unless it changes its course and approaches us. There is one more\nsource of information. I will examine the brains of the dead Jovians.\nPerhaps they know their leader's plans.\"\n\nFrom the first Jovian the Martian turned away with an expression of\ndisappointment.\n\n\"There is nothing in his brain but a scene of the fight with your\nfollowers, yet it may cheer you to know that at the last he felt fear,\nthe emotion the Jovians boast is foreign to them,\" said the Martian. \"I\nwill examine the other.\"\n\nWith his crimson ray he removed the covering from the brain of the\nsecond Jovian and connected his wires. For a few moments he was\nmotionless and then he removed the wires and crawled rapidly toward\nDamis.\n\n\"Nepthalim, here is what you wish,\" came his thoughts, jumbled in a\nchaotic state of excitement. \"This man had a wonderful brain and the\nimpressions of the last month are clear and distinct. Attend carefully\nand leave your mind a blank.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the Martian plain buildings suddenly materialized before the\nNepthalim's gaze. With a cry of astonishment he saw himself facing\nGlavour in defiance. Lura, who had been crouching behind him, ran into\none of the buildings. Act by act, Damis saw the fight between himself\nand the Jovian Viceroy repeated. The Viceroy, one arm dangling\nuselessly, was whisked away in his chariot. The scene faded and another\ntook its place. The Viceregal palace was beleaguered by thousands and\nscores of thousands of shouting Terrestrials. The Jovians sought with\nrays and with atomic bombs to disperse them, but where a score were\nblasted into nothingness or torn into fragments, a hundred fresh men\ntook their place. Suddenly the Jovian rays began to fail. The Earthmen\nhad found the secret source of power which supplied the palace and had\ncut it.\n\nAgain the scene faded and he was on a space ship with Havenner talking\nto him. The words he could not hear for the Martian could not comprehend\na record of a sound. The pictures conjured up by the words were easy of\ncomprehension and in picture forms the Martian conveyed to him the sense\nof the conversation. Havenner was telling him of their destination.\nFirst came a scene which he recognized as a Martian landscape. The\nJovians swarmed from their space ship and struck down the Earthmen\nwithout exertion. Three were made captives: himself, Turgan, and Lura.\nThe Jovians reentered the ship and sped away into space. Damis wondered\nwhat this last picture signified.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother scene materialized and they were on another planet. It was not\nMars and it was not Earth. For a moment he was puzzled. The sun, when it\nshone, was larger and fiercer than he had ever seen it, but it shone\nonly for an instant. Blankets of cloud and fog hid it from view. Rain\nfell incessantly. Lush, rank vegetation covered the ground and rose in a\ntangle far overhead. The Jovians emerged from the space ship, the\nprisoners in their midst. A huge lizard, a hundred feet long, rushed at\nthem but a flash of the disintegrating tubes dissolved it into dancing\nmotes of light. The Jovians made their way through the steaming jungle\nuntil a huge city, roofed with a crystal dome which covered it and\narched high into the air, appeared before them. Toward this city the\nJovians marched.\n\n\"The crystal cities of Venus!\" cried Turgan. Damis nodded in assent.\n\nAgain the scene changed and the Martian plain was before them. From the\nspace ship the Jovians emerged, but instead of the easy victory they had\nhad in the earlier scene, they found the task a difficult one. From all\nsides the Terrestrials charged at them and Damis found himself fighting\nagainst his compatriots. A sword flashed before his eyes and the scene\nwas gone.\n\n\"Have you learned that which you sought?\" came a Martian thought\ninquiry.\n\nDamis hastily formed his thoughts into an affirmative message of thanks\nand turned to Turgan.\n\n\"We know now where to go,\" he cried exultingly. \"Lura is safe until they\nland on Venus and enter the crystal cities, for Havenner would not dare\nto do otherwise than carry out the orders of Glavour. The Martian\nweapons which we have will insure us an easy victory. Come, let us\nhasten.\"\n\nA thought message from the Martians stopped him.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Those weapons on which you are planning, Nepthalim, were given to you\nby our Grand Mognac for the purpose of ridding your planet of your\noppressors and of defending your planet against further Jovian attacks,\nnot for the purpose of invading another planet with which we have no\nquarrel. If you will use them for the purpose for which they were given\nyou, you may depart with them in peace. If you plan to go to Venus, the\nweapons will remain on Mars.\"\n\n\"We will go to the Earth and rid her of her oppressors,\" replied Damis,\n\"but first we must go to Venus and rescue Lura.\"\n\n\"Venus lies beyond the sun,\" was the Martian answer, \"while your planet\nand Mars are on the same side. It will take you five times as long to go\nto Venus as to go to the Earth. Meanwhile the Jovian fleet will have\nlanded and your efforts will be in vain to dislodge them. Even now you\nmust fly at your best speed to reach your planet before them.\"\n\n\"But we cannot abandon Lura. She is the only daughter of my comrade and\nshe is my affianced bride. She means more to us than does the fate of\nour planet.\"\n\n\"Then go to Venus after her, Nepthalim, but go without Martian aid. Only\nto save you from your oppressors will we help you. Never has Mars\nattempted conquest of another celestial body, although not even Jupiter\ncould stand against our might if we chose to attack it.\"\n\n\"You cannot understand her relationship to us, Martian.\"\n\n\"No, I cannot. We are sexless and sex exists on Mars only for the\npurpose for which it was intended, the perpetuation of our species. It\nmay be that we have been mistaken. If the fate of one member of your\nspecies means more to you than the rescue of your whole race, it is\nperhaps well that you be eliminated by the Jovians. In any event, our\ndecision is final. Make your choice of whether you depart with the\nweapons or as you came.\"\n\n\"Then I will go to Venus,\" cried Damis. \"If necessary, I will fight the\nJovians with bare hands, but I will rescue Lura or die in the attempt.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And what of the Earthmen who trusted you, Nepthalim?\" asked Turgan.\n\"Dozens gave their lives gladly to capture the space ship in which we\ncame here and thousands have gone cheerfully to annihilation to keep the\nSons of God beleaguered in the Viceregal palace until we return with the\nweapons which will bring them victory. Think you that they would choose\nthe destruction of enslavement of the whole race to the possible chance\nof rescuing one person from the grasp of Glavour's minions?\"\n\n\"Turgan, you are mad!\" cried Damis. \"Have you forgotten that Lura is\nyour only child?\"\n\n\"Since the days of Hortan, Glavour has sought information as to the\nsecret assembly room. Hundreds of men have gone to torture and death\nwith their lips sealed when they could have bought life and freedom by\nspeaking.\"\n\n\"Were it my own life, Turgan, I would not hesitate.\"\n\n\"Think you that never before has an Earthman been faced with the choice\nof betraying his countrymen or seeing his wife or daughter violated and\nsacrificed in the games? All have been true to the last and yet they\ncould have done little harm had they spoken. _You_ have the fate of the\nEarth in your hand, yet you hesitate. I am Lura's father and I know her\nbetter, it seems, than do you. If you abandon her countrymen, she will\ndespise you for a coward. It is better that one or that many be lost\nthan that all be lost.\"\n\nDamis bowed his head in silence. Raised by the Jovians whose only ideal\nof life was their own selfish pleasure, the thought that the fate of\nthousands whom he did not know and in whom he felt little interest could\nbe of more importance than the fate of the one whose safety meant more\nthan life to him was a novel one. The lifelong training he had received\nfrom the Sons of God struggled, and struggled in vain, against the\nideals he had inherited from his Earthly mother and his loved sire. With\na face drawn with anguish, he raised his head.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We will take your weapons, Martian, and with them go to Earth. If it be\nHis will that Lura be safe, safe shall she be although the whole force\nof Jupiter threaten her. If not, His will be done. One promise I exact\nof you, Turgan. When we have reached Earth and I have taught your\nfollowers to use the Martian weapons, you will give me a crew and let me\ndepart to Venus to find her.\"\n\n\"Gladly will I promise, and if I be spared, I will go with you, Damis,\"\nsaid Turgan. \"Do not think that Lura is not dear to me; she is dearer\nthan all else in the Universe save only the keeping bright the ideal of\nloyalty that has been the guiding light of the Terrestrials for untold\nages.\"\n\n\"Your decision is well made, Nepthalim,\" said the Martian, \"and word of\nit shall be given to the Grand Mognac that he may know that he made no\nmistake when he entrusted you with the weapons of Mars. Now for your\ncourse. When you rise, direct your ship toward Deiphos. The Jovian fleet\nis now at an ascension of forty-two degrees and at an angle of one\nhundred and sixty degrees from the sun. Deiphos will hide you from their\ninstruments. Once you reach it, our observers will plot your course and\nsend you a bearing which will take you as far from the Jovian fleet as\npossible. They are now passing Ceres and will soon be out of the\nasteroid belt. They are larger and more powerful than the ship you are\nflying and they will make better speed. However, if you use your maximum\npower, you will easily arrive on your planet before them. Have you fuel\nenough for your trip at full speed?\"\n\nDamis hastily inspected the fuel supply of the ship and made some rapid\ncalculations.\n\n\"We have enough to carry us at maximum speed to Earth and to retard us\nto a safe landing, but very little to spare. Can you give us some?\"\n\n\"There is no tantalum on Mars except a little scattered through tons of\nrock. It would take us days to extract enough to do you any good. It is\nwell that you did not plan to fly to Venus for you could have made\nlittle speed and the Jovian flyer would have reached there long before\nyou did. Now go, and may our best wishes aid you in your flight.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nDamis turned and instinctively held out his hand. A trace of expression\nflickered over the face of the nearest Martian slug and he bent forward\nand clasped the proffered hand in one of the many hands with which he\nwas provided. No further message came to Damis from the Martians and he\nentered the airlock with Turgan following him. As the lock clanged shut,\nhe turned to his companion.\n\n\"Open the reserve air tanks and restore the atmosphere gradually to the\npressure of Earth,\" he directed. \"Unless you do that, we will be unable\nto function efficiently.\"\n\nWhile Turgan opened the valve which allowed the reserve supply of\ncompressed air to gradually enter the ship, Damis pulled down the\nstarting lever of the ship. With a terrific lurch the flyer left the\nsurface of Mars and shot up into the trackless realms of space.\nAbandoning his controls for an instant, Damis looked into one of the\nobservers. The plain below them was empty of Martians, but in the\ndistance he could dimly see two of the silvery domes which marked their\ncities. He made some short calculations and turned on a side motor for a\nmoment. The ship swerved and headed for the Martian satellite to which\nhe had been directed.\n\nIn an hour he was holding the ship less than a thousand miles from\nDeiphos while he received a message from the Grand Mognac as to the\nlocation of the Jovian fleet, their speed and course, and the course\nwhich he should fly to reach the Earth ahead of them. He noted down the\ndirections and set the cross hairs of his forward observer on Alpha\nCentauri. His hand sought the controlling lever and the ship rapidly\ngathered momentum for the trip to Earth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_A Desperate Plan_\n\n\nFlying the space ship with a crew of two men instead of the normal nine\nthrew a heavy strain on Damis. Turgan proved to be almost tireless, but\nwhile he could act as an observer, Damis devoutly hoped that no\nwandering celestial body would approach within the danger zone while he\nwas alone on duty. Nothing of the sort happened. The days passed with\nmonotonous slowness, yet daily and, indeed, hourly, the planet Mars\nfaded to a red star and the green point of light which marked their\ndestination grew larger. Damis cast many a longing glance at Venus, but\nhe remained steadfast to the faith which Turgan had engendered in him.\nDuring the long hours Turgan had opportunity to tell the Nepthalim of\nsome of the sacrifices made by Terrestrials for the cause of liberty.\nThey filled Damis with amazement and moved him to awe to think of the\nloyalty and bravery displayed by those whom he had been taught from\nchildhood to regard as a race of slaves, created solely to minister to\ntheir overlords.\n\nDamis pushed the ship to the greatest acceleration which he dared to\nuse, and, as they approached the Earth, he cast many an anxious glance\nat the diminishing fuel supply. For thirteen days he drove at high speed\nuntil the Earth seemed almost at hand. Using almost the full power of\nhis bow motors, he checked its speed. For a time he thought he had\noverestimated the power of his motors and that it would be necessary to\navoid the atmosphere belt, run past the Earth and return. At the middle\nof the fifteenth day, with the Earth less than a thousand miles away, he\nthrew in his last notch of power.\n\nThe deceleration pressed them so tightly to the nose of the ship that\nthey could hardly breathe. Damis lay with his hand on a side motor to\nthrow them out of danger. Gradually the forward motion of the ship\nceased and at last Damis rose with an effort and shut off the bow\nmotors.\n\n\"We are falling under the influence of terrestrial gravity,\" he\nannounced. \"In another three hours, we will land.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was as good as his word. Three hours later he dropped the space ship\nto a landing at a spot half a dozen miles distant from the beleaguered\ncapital of the Sons of God. As he landed, the sun was just peeping over\nthe eastern horizon.\n\nTheir approach had been seen and the ship was surrounded by hundreds of\nTerrestrial swordsmen. As the airlock opened and Damis and Turgan\nappeared there was silence for a moment and then a thunderous shout of\njoy rose to the heavens. From the forefront of the crowd, a\ncrimson-robed man ran toward the ship.\n\n\"Turgan, my lord,\" he cried as fell on his knees and strove to kiss the\nKildare's hand. \"You are spared to us who had given you up for lost. Our\nspies reported that the Sons of God had followed you to Mars and had\nslain you all. Havenner reported to Glavour that you had made such a\nresistance that it was impossible to follow his orders and bring you\nback alive.\"\n\n\"Havenner!\" cried Damis. \"Havenner is on Venus with Lura.\"\n\n\"The ship of the Sons of God returned last night,\" replied the Akildare,\n\"with a loss of two men of its crew and with the Princess Lura a\nprisoner.\"\n\nTears of joy sprang into Damis' eyes and ran unrestrained down his face.\n\n\"And she is safe?\" he cried.\n\n\"One of our spies saw her and reports that she is well although in poor\nspirits. She is confined in the palace and will not be harmed. A Jovian\nfleet of a hundred ships is expected hourly with Tubain himself in\ncommand. A message to Glavour has ordered that Lura be held for Tubain's\narrival, when he will dispose of her.\"\n\n\"What is the situation here, Toness?\" interrupted Turgan. \"I rejoice\nwith Damis that my daughter is safe, yet, unless we are victorious, her\npresent safety will avail her little.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Things have gone neither well nor ill since your departure, Kildare,\"\nreplied Toness. \"I have followed out the great conspiracy as it was\nplanned many years ago. Although we have lost thousands of our bravest\nmen, we have the Sons of God besieged in the Viceregal palace and we\nhave tapped and cut the secret source of power which Timour, the\nAkildare, found years ago. They have no weapons save some hand tubes\nthat are not yet exhausted and their axes. Their most powerful weapons\nof offense are crippled, yet we cannot storm the palace in the face of\nthe defenses they have left. Have you brought us any hope from Mars?\"\n\n\"We have brought weapons against which all the power and science of the\nSons of God are as helpless as is our feeble strength against their\nmight,\" replied Turgan. \"Send me men to transport these weapons, and in\ntwo hours not a Jovian will remain on the planet.\"\n\nA wild cheer of joy from the assembled Terrestrials answered the words\nof the Kildare. A score of men ran forward and entered the space ship on\nthe heels of Turgan. They reappeared in a few minutes carrying with the\ngreatest of care the two terrible weapons which were the gift of the\nGrand Mognac. Damis suddenly looked up from a reverie in which he had\nbeen plunged.\n\n\"I have just figured it out,\" he exclaimed. \"Despite his report to\nGlavour, Havenner knew that Turgan and I lived. He started away from\nMars toward Venus, a destination which he had already informed his crew\nthat they would make for. He feared the Martian weapons and he strove\nto draw us away toward Venus so that he would be safe. Once the Martian\ninstruments had ceased to watch him, he altered his course and made for\nEarth. With his greater supply of fuel and more powerful ship, he was\nable to make a higher speed and, despite the additional million or two\nof miles, he was able to land before us. The thing that puzzles me is\nwhy we were not seen by the Jovians as we approached.\"\n\n\"You came from a different direction than Havenner, oh Nepthalim,\"\nreplied Toness. \"All of their instruments were either watching Havenner\nor the Jovian fleet. But for an accident, your approach would not have\nbeen noted by us. I am confident that the Sons of God have no idea that\nyou have returned, especially since Havenner reported that he had slain\nyou. We will take them by surprise. Where shall we take the weapons?\"\n\n\"Take the one with the blue rod to the top of the mountain which\noverlooks the palace and set it so that the rod points in the direction\nfrom which Tubain's fleet is approaching. That hill is less than two\nmiles from the palace, so you had better take them both there. Point the\nred rod toward the palace.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt a word from Toness, the Terrestrials started off with the weapons for\nthe point indicated by Damis. The Nepthalim and Turgan followed them,\nrelating their adventure on the red planet as they walked along. The\nshutting off of the Jovian source of power had effectually crippled all\nof the power-driven chariots which certain of the higher officials among\nthe Earthmen had been allowed to maintain.\n\nOn the top of the hill overlooking the palace grounds the two Martian\nweapons were placed on the ground, side by side. Damis carefully aligned\nthe red rod on the Viceregal palace. When he had it set, with a word of\nwarning, he closed the gravity anchor switch. The instrument settled a\ntrifle on the solid rock on which it was bedded and then was motionless.\nAt a word from Damis, as many of the Terrestrials as could find a\nhand-rest pushed against it. It was as though they were pressing against\nthe mountain itself. Damis sighted along the rod and adjusted it until\nit pointed at the center of the building.\n\n\"So much for that one,\" he said. \"It is the less powerful of the two,\nbut it will be enough to destroy the Sons of God and the Nepthalim who\nare in the palace. The few who are scattered over the Earth, we can\ndispose of at our leisure. If the Jovian fleet approaches the Earth from\ndirectly above us, we will be able to destroy it easily. In any event,\nthis weapon is to be used only when it is approximately normal to the\nsurface of the Earth. We must have it almost under the point from which\nthe Jovians are approaching. That may be on the opposite side of the\nEarth.\"\n\n\"I think not, Nepthalim,\" said Toness. \"We know that Glavour and Tubain\nhave been in constant communication since the Jovian fleet passed Mars\nand he expects them to land here. There would be no object in their\ntaking a circuitous route, so they will probably drop directly down in\nthe palace grounds.\"\n\n\"Let us hope so, Toness. In any event, we might as well anchor the\nweapon here as elsewhere.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe set the weapon with the blue rod on another patch of bare rock and\ntested the rod to make sure that it revolved freely and could be made to\ncover the entire heavens from horizon to horizon. He closed the gravity\nanchor switch and again the efforts of a dozen Terrestrials were futile\nto move it.\n\n\"Now we are ready for their attack,\" he said to Turgan. \"You are as\nfamiliar with these weapons as I am, but I will instruct a dozen of\nyour followers in using them. It is possible that we may not be able to\noperate the weapons ourselves.\"\n\n\"I can operate one weapon while you manipulate the other, Damis,\"\nreplied the Kildare. \"However, no harm will be done in instructing\nothers.\"\n\n\"I may not be here,\" said Damis briefly.\n\nWithout replying to the questions of Turgan and Toness, he proceeded to\ninstruct a dozen of the Earthmen in the use of the terrible Martian\nweapons. When he was certain that he had a half dozen men capable of\nattending to each of the weapons, he turned to Turgan.\n\n\"I may not be here when the weapons are used,\" he said. \"When I thought\nthat Lura had gone to Venus, I gave her up and sacrificed both her and\nmy heart on the altar of our cause, for it is what she would have\nchosen. Now I have accomplished the sacrifice and returned with the\nMartian weapons to find that she is a captive in the Viceroy's palace.\nWe can turn on the rays and reduce the building and all in it to a pinch\nof dust in a few seconds, but Lura would be immolated with the Sons of\nGod. The weapons are here; our men know how to use them, and my\nusefulness is at an end. Now I stand here with no more responsibility\nfor our success than the humblest swordsman. Since I am no longer\nneeded, I will leave the fate of the Earth to you and follow out my\nprivate designs.\"\n\n\"Where are you going, Nepthalim?\" cried Toness. The question was echoed\nby all within the sound of his voice. Only Turgan smiled as though he\nknew Damis' answer.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Where could I go, Akildare, but to one place?\" replied the Nepthalim.\n\"I go to Glavour's palace. I have two errands there. One is to rescue\nLura and the other is to mete out to Glavour the death which I swore\nthat I would accomplish. The rays can be turned on and the palace\ndemolished at any time, but I ask that you wait until I return with Lura\nor until you know that we are dead.\"\n\n\"But if the Jovian fleet arrives before that time, Nepthalim?\" demanded\nToness.\n\n\"Then give the word for the use of the weapons, Akildare, and Lura's\nsoul and mine will join the thousands of others whose lives are but a\npart of the price the race of Earthmen have had to pay to rid their\nplanet of the Sons of God.\"\n\n\"It grieves me, Damis, to see you go to certain death,\" said Turgan\nsadly to the blond giant, \"yet I will say nothing to stop you. Were it\nnot that my presence would hinder you in your attempt, I would accompany\nyou.\"\n\n\"Your place, Kildare, is at the head of your men, whom you were born to\nrule. I can hope to succeed only by stealth, else a thousand men would\ncome with me. Now call from the ranks one who is a barber that he may\nchange the color of my hair and alter my face that I shall not be\nknown.\"\n\nAt the Kildare's word, three men stepped forward from the ranks of\nswordsmen and announced themselves adepts in the art of disguise. Swift\nrunners were sent to bring supplies and the three labored over Damis.\nWhen they had finished their ministrations, only a close observer would\nhave known him under the bushy black beard which covered his face.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_In the Seraglio_\n\n\nWith a parting word to Turgan and his followers, Damis made his way\nalone down the hill and into the thick tropical jungle which grew up\nalmost to the gates of the Viceregal palace. He was well acquainted\nwith a secret entrance into the building. It was a matter of minutes for\nhim to locate the outer end and open it.\n\nFor half a mile he made his way underground until a huge stone door\nbarred his way. He felt for the hidden catches and the slab of rock rose\nbefore him. As he turned toward the doorway he found himself looking\ninto the muzzle of a black ray tube in the hands of a gigantic Jovian in\nthe uniform of the Viceroy's guards.\n\n\"Whence came you, Nepthalim?\" demanded the guard, a cold note of\nsuspicion in his voice.\n\n\"From far Torna,\" replied Damis readily. \"I am Durmino, Komar of the\nprovince of Capries. The slaves rose on us and all were slain except me.\nI have had to travel by night and hide by day to reach here. I knew not\nwhether the slaves had conquered or not, but when I found them lying by\nthousands about Glavour's palace, I knew that the reign of the Sons of\nGod was safe. What news from Tubain?\"\n\nThe face of the Jovian guard cleared as Damis spoke. Durmino, a son of\nGlavour by one of his Terrestrial concubines, was Komar of Capries, a\nfact well known to Damis. There was nothing in the newcomer's story to\nexcite suspicion.\n\n\"The fleet of the Ruler of the Universe is approaching,\" the guard\nreplied. \"In two hours it will be hovering above us. We would have\nneeded no aid had not the dogs of Earthmen found our source of power and\nmanaged to destroy it with stolen ray tubes. We have been cooped up here\nlike rats waiting for Tubain to arrive. When he comes our vengeance will\nbe heavy.\"\n\n\"The heavier the better,\" growled Damis with an oath. \"The dogs have\nbeen getting surly for a generation. I hope that Tubain will teach them\na lesson that will not be forgotten for ages to come.\"\n\n\"He will, never fear,\" laughed the guard. \"Already Glavour has made his\nplans. I am not a member of the council, yet I have heard enough to\nrealize why Glavour is our ruler. My brain could not conceive of such a\nstupendous plan.\"\n\n\"I will go to my father now,\" said Damis. \"What is the word for passing\nthe inner gate? I wish to surprise my sire for he doubtless mourns me as\ndead.\"\n\n\"He thinks you are dead,\" replied the guard, \"yet I never heard of\nGlavour mourning for any loss which did not affect his pleasures. He has\nplenty of bastards to take your place. The word is 'Tubain.'\"\n\n\"I thank you, Son of God,\" said Damis, \"and I will inform my sire of the\ngreat respect and high regard which you have for him. Fear not, your\nwords shall be truthfully reported to him.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nLeaving the Jovian guard hastily reviewing the conversation with the\nsupposed Durmino, Damis made his way toward the palace. Since he knew\nthat he would not reach another door until after several of the\nunderground passages with which the foundations of the palace were\nhoneycombed had joined, he had little doubt of his ability to make his\nway unsuspected into the citadel. He debated for a moment on the\nadvisability of killing the Jovian guard and taking his weapons, but\ncaution prevailed, and empty-handed, save for a dagger concealed under\nhis robes, he strode forward.\n\nHis knowledge of the password enabled him to pass the various guards he\nmet without difficulty. There were many of the Nepthalim who held\nsubordinate positions in the outlying provinces and who were seldom at\ncourt, and the Jovian guards, who in their hearts regarded the Nepthalim\nas little better than the Terrestrials, paid small attention to him. He\npassed several guarded points before the path rose steeply and he passed\nthrough the final gate into the palace itself. A Nepthalim passed him\nhurriedly and Damis plucked at his robe.\n\n\"I am just from outpost,\" he said. \"What news of Tubain?\"\n\n\"The fleet has entered the atmosphere belt a thousand miles east of\nhere,\" replied the Nepthalim. \"They are dropping to an altitude of five\nmiles and will then approach. They should arrive in an hour. It is well\nthat they hurry.\"\n\n\"What rush is there?\" asked Damis in surprise. \"We may not be able to\nleave here, but, at the same time, all the forces the slaves can muster\nwould never force an entrance.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You have not heard then?\" exclaimed the other in surprise.\n\"No--certainly not, if you have been on outpost--for I just learned it\nmyself. There is a rumor that Havenner lied when he said that he killed\nTurgan, the Kildare and Damis, the renegade--the curse of Tubain rest on\nhim--on Mars. It is said that they not only escaped death but have\nreturned to Earth armed with the weapons of the red planet. Havenner is\nwith Glavour now and no one knows what the outcome will be. Since Tubain\nis at hand, doubtless nothing will be done until he arrives. That is the\nreason why Tubain altered his course and came down so far away instead\nof directly overhead. He hopes thus to elude the Martian weapons if the\nEarthmen really have them.\"\n\n\"Surely that is a lie!\" cried Damis.\n\n\"We hope that it is, yet Havenner would have been slain without mercy\nhad he admitted that he left Mars without slaying or capturing Turgan\nand Damis. Many believe that it is true.\"\n\n\"Is Glavour in the council room?\" asked Damis. \"I have a message.\"\n\n\"It would be better for you to defer the message if it be ill news until\nTubain arrives, brother, for Glavour is enraged beyond measure at all of\nus. He threatens to sacrifice us at the next games and he may do so\nunless Tubain alters the decree. He has not loved us since Damis broke\nhis arm a month ago.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, I will deliver my message,\" replied Damis. \"While it may\nnot please him, it is essential that he get it before Tubain arrives.\"\n\n\"Good luck go with you, brother,\" replied the Nepthalim with a shrug of\nhis shoulders. \"The temper of the Viceroy of God is an uncertain quality\nat best. He is in his seraglio.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nDamis saluted the messenger and made his way toward the inner portion of\nthe palace where the women whom the lustful Viceroy had dragged into his\nharem were kept. He had no plausible excuse for passing the guards into\nthis forbidden portion of the palace, but that was a matter which caused\nhim small worry. There were few of the secrets of the palace which were\nnot well known to Damis, who had at one time been major domo of the\nbuilding. There were some well known to him, the existence of which was\nnot even suspected by the majority of the Sons of God.\n\nAs he neared the seraglio, he turned off to his right and passed through\na maze of little-used passages until he halted before what was\napparently a blank wall. Casting a rapid glance around to ensure himself\nthat there was no one in sight, he touched a hidden catch and a portion\nof the wall swung inward, opening a way before him. He entered a passage\nbuilt in the thickness of the wall and lighted with radium bulbs. The\ndoor closed softly behind him. He removed his sandals lest even their\nquiet tread should betray him and on bare feet crept forward.\n\nThe passage bent and twisted as it followed the walls until Damis knew\nthat he was in one of the walls of the seraglio. Praying that it would\nwork noiselessly, he slid open a panel of stone and found himself\nlooking through a semi-transparent hanging into the sacred precincts of\nthe seraglio itself. Glavour stood facing him, his heavy face drawn up\nin a scowl of rage. Damis noted with satisfaction that one of the\nViceroy's arms was supported by a silk scarf and that he made no attempt\nto use it. With a pale face, Havenner stood before his ruler.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The word has been brought to me from a source which I trust as much as\nI do your own word, Havenner,\" Glavour was saying. \"I tell you, I do not\nbelieve your story. If Damis and Turgan were dead, the Terrestrials\nwould not see them alive again on Earth. Neither would they have weapons\nof which we know nothing. One of our observers admits that he saw a\nspace ship land a few hours ago, coming from the direction of Mars. You\nfailed in your mission, Havenner, and on you I pronounce the doom. I\nsentence you to the twilight of the gods.\"\n\n\"I appeal to Tubain from that sentence!\" cried the equerry with dry\nlips.\n\n\"Your appeal shall be noted and laid before him at the proper time,\"\nreplied the Viceroy savagely; \"yet, by the time he arrives, it will be\ntoo late. Ho, Guards! Take him away.\"\n\nHavenner turned as though to resist, but six of the huge Jovians\nanswered the Viceroy's call. Two of them grasped him by the arms and\nstarted to lead him from the room.\n\n\"I appeal!\" cried Havenner again. \"I brought back the maiden whom I was\nsent to fetch, and for that reason I made no failure. To bring her was\nthe principal item of my orders.\"\n\nGlavour's face grew purple with rage.\n\n\"And who sent the message to Tubain which resulted in the orders which\nhe sent me?\" he demanded savagely. \"It was sent by one of your henchmen\nand by your orders. You slew the sender before I could question him, but\nI know whose orders he obeyed. Take him away!\"\n\nThe guards started to drag the luckless equerry from the presence of the\nViceroy, but Havenner made a final appeal for his life.\n\n\"I will confess, Viceroy of God,\" he cried. \"No message was sent to\nTubain. I dared not send such a message lest such orders would be\nreturned as I caused to be given to you. I coveted the maiden for myself\nand I took this means of getting her. I had a false message delivered to\nyou which would prevent you from taking her before Tubain arrived. In\nreward for my services as spy on you, I planned to ask that she be given\nto me. I surrender all claims to her, Glavour. Spare my life and you may\nhave her.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment Glavour could not speak for rage.\n\n\"So you have been the spy who has reported my every doing and my every\nsecret council to Tubain!\" he gasped. \"But for you, I would long ago\nhave conquered Venus and Mercury and declared myself independent of the\nJovian overlord. In time I might have even overthrown him, but every\nmove was known to him before I made it. Not once, but a dozen times,\nwould you go through the twilight were Tubain not at hand. Niton, it is\nmy order that the twilight be as slow as our instruments will allow.\nGive him time to learn to suffer and to pray for the blessing of death\nat my hand. Take him away!\"\n\nThe struggling Havenner was removed by the guards despite his efforts at\nresistance and his cries for mercy. Glavour stared after him for a\nmoment and an evil gleam came into his eyes.\n\n\"Sonom!\" he called sharply.\n\nA guard entered the room and saluted.\n\n\"Sonom, bring me the Daughter of Man, Lura!\" cried the Viceroy. \"When\nyou have brought her here, post guards at all doors and see that no one\nis admitted under any circumstances until Tubain himself arrives and\ndemands admittance.\"\n\nThe guard hesitated.\n\n\"Your Excellency,\" he faltered, \"the orders from Tubain were--\"\n\n\"False rumors given out by the traitor, Havenner, who has now gone to\nthe twilight of the gods,\" interrupted the Viceroy. \"By the crown of\nTubain, do I need to repeat my orders? I am Viceroy of the Earth and am\nsupreme until Tubain revokes my rank. Obey my orders!\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe guard saluted and withdrew. Glavour licked his thick lips in\nanticipation and strode restlessly back and forth across the room.\nInside the hangings, Damis' face hardened and he drew his dagger from\nunder his robe. The door opened and Sonom returned, dragging Lura after\nhim. The face of the Earth-girl was pale and drawn, yet, when she saw\nGlavour, her head rose in an expression of defiance. Sonom saluted the\nViceroy and left the room, the massive door clanging shut behind him.\nGlavour stared at the girl with an evil leer on his heavy countenance.\n\n\"I have learned, Daughter of Man,\" he said slowly, \"of how you seduced\none of my servants from his duty to me and caused him to forge an order\nfrom the great Tubain in order that he might keep you for his own\npleasure. For a time the stratagem succeeded, but now my eyes are open.\nWhen I first looked upon your face and form I swore to myself that you\nshould be the solace of my leisure hours. Now the time is come. I was\nminded once to honor you as Hortan once honored a Terrestrial and let\nyou amuse yourself by sitting on a throne, but your treachery has\nchanged my intention. Not even as an accepted concubine shall you rank,\nbut only as a slave to be used as a toy and tossed to one of my guards\nwhen I am tired of you. Come hither!\"\n\nLura made no move to obey the order, and Glavour with an oath stepped\ntoward her, his one good arm outstretched in a grasping gesture. Lura\ndid not move until his hand almost closed on her arm and then she sprang\nback. Her hand sought the bosom of her robe and the Viceroy recoiled as\na glittering dagger flashed in the air.\n\n\"Back, Jovian!\" cried Lura in ringing tones. \"Think you that the\ndaughter of a king of men is to be a toy for your base Jovian passions?\nThe point of this dagger is poisoned so that one touch through your skin\nwill mean death. One step nearer and I will strike!\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Viceroy hesitated for a moment and then drew from his robe a short\nthick tube. Lura correctly interpreted the gesture.\n\n\"Raise that tube and I will bury the blade in my own body!\" she cried.\n\"I know that you have the power to clasp me in your arms, but it will be\na corpse which you clasp.\"\n\nShe lowered the knife until the point rested against the skin of her\nthroat. The slightest pressure would cause it to penetrate her skin and\nbring about her almost instant death. Glavour watched her like a cat,\nthe tube ready in his hand. With a grim laugh he threw the tube from him\nand walked a few steps away. Lura lowered the knife. As she did so,\nGlavour turned with a movement so swift that the eye could hardly follow\nit. His eyes caught Lura's and she straightened back her head, powerless\nagainst his will, caught as she was, momentarily off her guard.\n\n\"Throw down your knife,\" said Glavour's voice slowly. Lura struggled to\nraise the weapon against herself, but she could not. Slowly her fingers\nrelaxed and the weapon clattered on the floor. Still holding her eyes\nwith his own, Glavour stepped forward until his huge splayed foot rested\non the weapon. He averted his gaze and swiftly picked it up. Lura gave a\nscream of horror and strove to fly, but the heavy door was barred\nagainst her. Glavour placed the weapon in a cabinet on the wall which he\nlocked and then turned to her, an expression of triumph on his face.\n\n\"It is useless, Daughter of Man, to struggle against the will of the\nSons of God,\" he said mockingly. \"What we desire is ours. Come to me.\"\n\nLura's face showed an expression of loathing as she looked at the huge\nmisshapen monstrosity before her. The Viceroy forgot the momentary\nsatisfaction of his triumph in his rage at her attitude. With a growl of\nanger he grasped at her. Lura avoided his rush and ran along the side of\nthe room, Glavour in pursuit. He cornered her at last and she stopped\nwith her back to the tapestry with which the room was hung. Glowering in\nhis triumph, Glavour approached and reached out his hand to seize her.\nHis huge paw descended, but before it touched her shoulder a hand with\nfingers of steel reached through the hangings and grasped his wrist.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Sonom had dragged Lura into the room, Damis inserted the point of\nhis dagger into the tapestry and started to cut a slit through which he\ncould enter the room. The keen-edged knife cut for a few inches readily\nenough and then stopped. Damis withdrew the blade and examined the stuff\nbefore him. An expression of dismay crossed his face, for the material\nwas crisscrossed with stellanium wires, set six inches apart. Each\njuncture was braised together and the whole made a web through which he\ncould not force his way. Cautiously he exerted his strength. The keen\nblade hewed through the first of the stellanium strands, but Damis held\nhis breath as the wire parted. It seemed impossible that the ting of\nparting metal which sounded like a thunderclap in his ears would not be\nheard by the Viceroy. He knew that there must be an entrance into the\nroom through the hangings and he made his way cautiously forward,\ntesting the draperies from time to time with his knife.\n\nWhen Lura laid her dagger against her breast and threatened to end her\nlife, it took all of Damis' self-control to keep from crying out and\nstriving to force his way into the room by sheer strength. He knew the\ntoughness of stellanium well enough to realize the impossibility of even\nhis enormous strength tearing apart a webbing of it. The certainty that\nGlavour would not push matters far enough to rob himself of his prey\naided him to restrain his ardor and to pursue his systematic search.\n\nHe came at last to a corner where his knife met with no resistance as it\nmade its way through the silken stuff on the walls. Swiftly he cut a\nslit through which he could rush. As he parted the material, Lura rushed\npast him and stood with her back to the wall to await the oncoming\nViceroy. Damis raised his hand and stood ready. As Glavour's huge paw\ndescended on Lura's shoulder Damis' hand shot out. Still holding the\nwrist of the Viceroy in a grip of steel, he emerged from his hiding\nplace, tearing off the black wig and beard which disguised him.\n\n\"Damis!\" cried Lura in wonder and delight as she saw him.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nGlavour stared with unbelieving eyes for a moment and then a hoarse cry\nof alarm burst from his lips. Desperately he strove to release his\nwrist from the Nepthalim's grip, but to no avail. He disengaged his\ncrippled arm from the scarf which supported it and groped under his robe\nfor a weapon. Lura cried out in warning, but Damis had anticipated such\na move. With a quick effort he whirled about and drew the Viceroy's arm\nover his shoulder. He bent forward and exerted his full strength. The\nhuge bulk of Glavour rose in the air and pitched forward over Damis'\nshoulder. There was a crash as he landed on the marble floor. Quick as a\ncat, Damis sprang on him and pinioned down his arms.\n\n\"Take his weapons, Lura!\" he cried.\n\nLura bent over the prostrate form of the Jovian to take from his belt\nthe tubes which he habitually carried there. As she stooped, Glavour\nraised one of his huge feet and struck her with all the force of his\nmighty thighs behind the blow. With a cry of pain, Lura flew halfway\nacross the room. Damis leaped to her assistance, forgetting for a moment\nthe potentialities for destruction which the Viceroy bore on his person.\nA sudden sound made him whirl about. He bent over Lura and picked her\nfrom the floor. With her in his arms he leaped to one side just as a\nflash of violet light stabbed through the air. It missed them by inches.\nHe dropped Lura on a rug and turned to face Glavour.\n\nOn the Jovian's face was an expression of fiendish triumph. In his hand\nwas a short black tube which he aimed with deliberate slowness at the\ncrouching Nepthalim. Damis shifted his gaze from the Viceroy's eyes and\nconcentrated it on the muscles of his wrist. Glavour's grip tightened\nand Damis leaped to one side as the violet light again stabbed the air.\nWith an oath, Glavour swung the deadly ray in an arc trying to reach the\nNepthalim, but Damis moved like a cat. Once, as the ray almost touched\nhim, he sprang high in the air and let it sweep by under him. With each\nmovement he came nearer to the Viceroy. Slowly the violet began to lose\nits intensity of color. Glavour dropped it and reached for a second\ntube. Before he could draw one, Damis was on him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_The Deluge_\n\n\nFew of the Sons of God and none of the Nepthalim, save Damis, could\nmatch the brute strength of the Viceroy. As Damis rushed, Glavour\nsidestepped and caught the Nepthalim's arm in a bone-crushing grasp.\nDamis made no effort to break the grip, but with his free hand he\ngripped the wrist of Glavour's crippled arm. With a quick effort he\ntwisted it and the Viceroy gave a shriek of pain as the newly knit bone\ngave way and his arm fell, dangling and useless. Damis caught his sound\narm in a powerful grip and twisted slowly on his wrist. Gradually\nGlavour's fingers relaxed and Damis' arm was free. His hands shot up and\ngripped Glavour about the throat just in time to shut off the cry for\nhelp which was forming on his thick lips. The two giants strove silently\nfor mastery in the struggle which meant life for the victor and death\nfor the vanquished. The expression in Damis' eyes was one of confident\nmastery, but the face of the Jovian showed something that was strangely\nakin to fear. Even when he was whole, Glavour had found that his\nstrength was no match for the power that lay in Damis' graceful limbs.\nWith one of the Viceroy's arms useless, the issue was a foregone\nconclusion.\n\nGlavour's face gradually grew purple and his eyes started out of their\nsockets. His tongue protruded horribly from his opened jaws. He grew\nweaker until it was only Damis' grip which kept him from falling to the\nground. Then Damis broke his silence and spoke slowly and distinctly\ninto the dying Viceroy's ears.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I was loyal to you, Glavour,\" he said, \"despite your brutality and\nsensuality which sickened me, until you strove to add to your already\ncrowded seraglio the maiden whom I had chosen. As a Nepthalim, you\nthought I had no right which you need respect and I would tamely submit\nto whatever you chose to do. You forgot that in my veins run the best\nblood of Earth and the proudest blood of Jupiter. Hortan was a Mildash\nof Jupiter, a rank to which you could never aspire. I restricted your\nefforts and proved to you a thing which I long have known, that, man to\nman, I am your superior.\n\n\"Even then you might have won back my loyalty had I not learned how my\nfather and my mother came to their death. It has always been given out\nthat they went to Jupiter on a summons from Tubain, but I know the\ntruth. They died under the knife of a cowardly assassin, under your\nknife, Glavour. Then it was that I swore that it would be my hand that\nwould strike you down. When you raised your hand against me, you were\nViceroy of the Earth and your power was secure, for the conspiracy\nagainst you had no hope of success. What is the situation now? You are\nbeleaguered in your palace, holding only the ground your few feeble\nweapons cover. Even this ground you hold only on the sufferance of the\nEarthmen. Listen to what I say, for I wish your last moments to be\nbitter ones. On the hill east of the city sit two weapons of a type and\na power unknown to both Earth and Jupiter. They are the deadly black ray\nweapons of Mars. Ah, you tremble! You have good cause. One of them is\ntrained on this palace while the other searches the heavens, ready to\nblast into powder the fleet of Tubain when it appears. And who, think\nyou, brought this about, Glavour? It was I, Damis, the Nepthalim, the\n'half-breed bastard' whom you despised. My only regret is that I cannot\nsend you to the twilight of the gods as you sent that other\narch-traitor, Havenner. Are your last moments pleasant, Glavour? I am\nincreasing the pressure slowly so that you will have time to think, to\nthink of the Earthmen you have given to sacrifice and torture, to think\nof your ruler, Hortan, dying under your knife, to think of the doom\nwhich is about to overcome your race. Think, Glavour, for your time for\nthought is short.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he finished, Damis thrust back on the Viceroy's chin with a sudden\neffort. There was a dull crack as Glavour's neck broke and Damis gently\nlowered the inert bulk to the floor. He felt a touch on his arm as he\nstraightened up. He whirled like a cat and Lura shrank back with a\nfrightened gesture. Damis opened his arms and in an instant the\nEarth-girl was folded in them.\n\n\"Is my father safe?\" was her first question.\n\n\"Safer by far than we are,\" exclaimed Damis with a sudden pang of\nanxiety. He glanced at the time-recording device on the wall.\nThree-quarters of an hour had passed since he had first entered the\nViceregal palace. If the estimates of Tubain's arrival which he had\nheard were correct, the Jovian fleet should be almost most overhead.\n\"Come,\" he cried to Lura, \"we have no time to lose if we escape before\nthe palace and all in it are destroyed. Where did Havenner land his\nship?\"\n\n\"In the yard west of the palace,\" she replied.\n\n\"Pray that it is still there,\" said Damis. \"We can reach it through the\npath by which I entered this room. Come quickly.\"\n\nWith Lura at his heels, he passed through the rent in the tapestry and\nentered the secret passage through the walls. The way twisted and turned\ninterminably, but finally he paused before a door. Before opening it he\nslid back a panel which opened a peep-hole and looked out.\n\n\"The ship is there,\" he whispered in a voice of relief. \"There is only\none guard over it that I can see. Why didn't I think to bring Glavour's\nweapons? I'll have to try to catch him by surprise. When I open the\ndoor, run straight for the space ship as though you were trying to\nescape from me. Don't try to dodge the guard, keep right on for the\nship. As soon as I overpower the guard, get in the ship and hold your\nhand on the starting lever. When I get on board, throw in the power at a\nlow rate. We don't want to rise rapidly enough to get out of easy\ncontrol. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, Damis,\" she whispered.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe watched until a sudden shout drew the attention of the sentry\nmomentarily away from the ship he was guarding. A confused sound of\ncheering came from the palace and the sentry looked toward the western\nheavens. A moment of gazing and he raised his voice in a raucous shout\nof joy. Instantly Damis swung open the door.\n\nLura sped out like a frightened deer with Damis in close pursuit. The\nattention of the sentry was fixed on some distant object in the sky and\nhe did not see the oncoming pair until Lura was only a few yards from\nhim. The sound of her footsteps attracted his attention and he glanced\ndown at her. An expression of surprise came over his heavy features and\nhe reached for a weapon. His gesture was never finished, for Damis' fist\ncaught him under the ear and he dropped in his tracks. Damis looked in\nthe direction in which the sentry had been staring and a cry broke from\nhis lips.\n\n\"The fleet of Tubain!\" he cried.\n\nA thousand yards in the air and a scant five miles to the west was a\nclump of half a dozen Jovian space flyers. Massed behind them were a\nhundred more. They were approaching with tremendous velocity.\n\nDamis gave a mighty bound and leaped through the airlock of the ship.\nHardly had he cleared the door than Lura pulled down the starting lever.\nThe ship flew up from the ground. Hardly had it left its ways than a\nmomentary flash came from the hill east of the palace. The air grew\nblack around them and a cold as of interstellar space penetrated their\nvery bones. In an instant the ship had flashed up into the sun above the\nzone of influence of the Martian weapon. The shouting from the palace\nwas suddenly stilled. Damis looked down, but nothing could be seen save\na pall of intense blackness over the ground where the building stood.\n\n\"The port motor, Lura!\" cried Damis. The Jovian fleet was approaching so\nrapidly that a collision with the nearest flyer seemed inevitable. There\nwas a roar from the air as Lura threw in the port blast with its maximum\npower. Damis was hurled against the side of the ship.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom the hill where the Martian weapons had been placed came a second\nflash of light and a beam of jetty blackness shot through the air. An\nedge of it brushed the ship for an instant and Lura stiffened. A\nterrible cold bit through the flyer and the side where the Martian ray\nhad touched crumpled into powder. The ship sped on, and the friction of\nthe air and the bright rays of the sun dissipated the extreme cold.\nThrough the terrific storm which was raging, the black ray stabbed again\nand again. Back and forth it played and ship after ship of the Jovians\nwas momentarily caught in the beam. When the beam passed on there was\nnothing left of the ship save a cloud of dust which the terrific wind\ndissipated in all directions.\n\nDamis glanced at the Earth below him. It seemed to be flying past the\nship at a velocity which he could hardly comprehend. He made his way\nagainst the pressure of the movement to the control levers and strove to\ncheck the speed. As the Earth ceased to revolve beneath them, the wind\nrose to a terrible force.\n\n\"What has happened, Damis?\" shrieked Lura in his ear.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he shouted in reply. \"I am trying to keep away from the\nneighborhood of the palace for a while until the Jovian fleet is\ndestroyed. Toness and your father might not be able to tell us from one\nof Tubain's ships and they might turn the ray on us.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe bent over the control levers of the ship, but they refused to obey\nhis touch. The stern motor still roared with enough force to keep them\nthree thousand feet above the ground, but none of the side motors\nresponded to the controls. The ship was helpless and was tossed about, a\nplaything of the terrific wind which howled through the heavens. Damis\nwatched the ground below them.\n\n\"Look, Lura!\" he cried.\n\nThey swept over the site of the palace. The black ray was no longer\nplaying on it, but the whole palace glistened like crystal.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Frost!\" he shouted. \"The Martian weapon did its work well. Everything\nin that palace is frozen. In the name of Tubain!\"\n\nThe Jovian ejaculation had burst from his lips, unbidden, at the sight\nwhich met his gaze. Racing over the land was a solid wall of water,\nhundreds of feet high and moving with enormous speed. On toward the\npalace it swept. Below they could see the Earthmen on the hill striving\nto fly, but there was no place of safety. The oncoming wall of water was\nhigher by a hundred feet than the top of the hill and it was the highest\nbit of land for many miles.\n\nNearer and nearer came the water until with a roar and a crash which\nthey could plainly hear in the crippled space ship, it swept over the\nhill and the palace, burying them under a hundred feet of brine.\n\n\"Father!\" cried Lura in anguish.\n\nDamis made his way across the ship and folded her in his arms.\n\n\"He was chosen as one of the lives needed to buy the freedom of the\nEarth,\" he murmured to her. \"It is hard, for I loved him as a father;\nbut it was the end which he would have chosen. He died at the head of\nhis followers battling for freedom.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What happened, Damis?\" asked Lura an hour later as she looked down on\nthe seething tumult of water under them.\n\n\"As nearly as I can figure out, the Jovian fleet approached the palace\nfrom the west at a low elevation. In order to destroy them, we could not\nuse the Martian weapon normal to the Earth's surface as they commanded\nus, but were forced to use it tangentially. The enormous counter\nreaction to the stream of force of almost incredible intensity which was\nshot at Tubain's flyers, had to be absorbed in some way. The weapon\ncould not take it up as it was anchored to the center of gravity of the\nearth. As a result, the force was translated into one of increased\nrotation. The Earth must be spinning on its axis at fully twice its\nformer rate. Both the air and the water had too much inertia to follow\nthe accelerated motion of the land, so the wind blew a gale and the\noceans left their beds and swept over the land. Everything must have\nbeen swept to destruction before this flood.\"\n\n\"And all our labor and sacrifice has been useless,\" cried Lura. \"We\nhave freed a world at the cost of the lives of its inhabitants.\"\n\n\"The world is not lost, sweetheart,\" he cried as he clasped her to him.\n\"The floods will not have overwhelmed the mountains and some men and\nanimals will have escaped. The waters will subside in a few weeks as\nthey take up the new rotation of the Earth. By His will, we are spared\nfor the labor of building a new world. As soon as the land again appears\nabove the waters, we will land and assemble those who have been spared.\nThe fleet of Jupiter has been destroyed and we need fear no fresh attack\nfor ages, perhaps never. Unhampered, we will build a new world and try\nto avoid the mistakes of the old one.\n\n\"Look, Damis!\" exclaimed Lura in a hushed tone.\n\nFrom the spray and mist below them leaped a living bridge of colored\nlight. Above the sun it arced its way into the heavens in the direction\nin which they knew Mars lay.\n\n\"It is His promise,\" whispered Damis reverently, \"that henceforth the\nplanets will live in peace and amity and that nevermore will the Jovians\nbe allowed to invade us.\"\n\n\n                               (The End.)\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\nThis e-text was produced from Astounding Stories December 1931 and\nJanuary 1932 issues.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
