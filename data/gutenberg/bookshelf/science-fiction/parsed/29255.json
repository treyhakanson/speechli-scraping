Breuer, M.D._\n\n\nPART I\n\n_The Science Community_\n\n(This part is related by Peter Hagstrom, Ph.D.)\n\n\n\"The ability to communicate ideas from one individual to another,\" said\na professor of sociology to his class, \"is the principal distinction\nbetween human beings and their brute forbears. The increase and\nrefinement of this ability to communicate is an index of the degree of\ncivilization of a people. The more civilized a people, the more perfect\ntheir ability to communicate, especially under difficulties and in\nemergencies.\"\n\n[Sidenote: _The delivery of his country into the clutches of a\nmerciless, ultra-modern religion can be prevented only by Dr. Hagstrom's\ndeciphering an extraordinary code._]\n\nAs usual, the observation burst harmlessly over the heads of most of the\nstudents in the class, who were preoccupied with more immediate\nthings--with the evening's movies and the week-end's dance. But upon two\nyoung men in the class, it made a powerful impression. It crystallized\nwithin them certain vague conceptions and brought them to a conscious\nfocus, enabling the young men to turn formless dreams into concrete\nacts. That is why I take the position that the above enthusiastic words\nof this sociology professor, whose very name I have forgotten, were the\nprime moving influence which many years later succeeded in saving\nOccidental civilization from a catastrophe which would have been worse\nthan death and destruction.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of these young men was myself, and the other was my lifelong friend\nand chum, Carl Benda, who saved his country by solving a tremendously\ndifficult scientific puzzle in a simple way, by sheer reasoning power,\nand without apparatus. The sociology professor struck a responsive chord\nin us: for since our earliest years we had wigwagged to each other as\nBoy Scouts, learned the finger alphabet of the deaf and dumb so that we\nmight maintain communication during school hours, strung a telegraph\nwire between our two homes, admired Poe's \"Gold Bug\" together and\ndevised boyish cipher codes in which to send each other postcards when\nchance separated us. But we had always felt a little foolish about what\nwe considered our childish hobbies, until the professor's words suddenly\nroused us to the realization that we were a highly civilized pair of\nyoungsters.\n\nNot only did we then and there cease feeling guilty about our secret\nciphers and our dots and dashes, but the determination was born within\nus to make of communication our life's work. It turned out that both of\nus actually did devote our lives to the cause of communication; but the\npassing years saw us engaged in widely and curiously divergent phases of\nthe work. Thirty years later, I was Professor of the Psychology of\nLanguage at Columbia University, and Benda was Maintenance Engineer of\nthe Bell Telephone Company of New York City; and on his knowledge and\nskill depended the continuity and stability of that stupendously complex\ntraffic, the telephone communication of Greater New York.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSince our ambitious cravings were satisfied in our everyday work, and\nsince now ordinarily available methods of communication sufficed our\nneeds, we no longer felt impelled to signal across the house-tops with\nsemaphores nor to devise ciphers that would defy solution. But we still\nkept up our intimate friendship and our intense interest in our beloved\nsubject. We were just as close chums at the age of fifty as we had been\nat ten, and just as thrilled at new advances in communication: at\ntelevision, at the international language, at the supposed signals from\nMars.\n\nThat was the state of affairs between us up to a year ago. At about that\ntime Benda resigned his position with the New York Bell Telephone\nCompany to accept a place as the Director of Communication in the\nScience Community. This, for many reasons, was a most amazing piece of\nnews to myself and to anyone who knew Benda.\n\nOf course, it was commonly known that Benda was being sought by\nUniversities and corporations: I know personally of several tempting\noffers he had received. But the New York Bell is a wealthy corporation\nand had thus far managed to hold Benda, both by the munificence of its\nsalary and by the attractiveness of the work it offered him. That the\nScience Community would want Benda was easy to understand; but, that it\ncould outbid the New York Bell, was, to say the least, a surprise.\n\nFurthermore, that a man like Benda would want to have anything at all to\ndo with the Science Community seemed strange enough in itself. He had\nthe most practical common sense--well-balanced habits of thinking and\nliving, supported by an intellect so clear and so keen that I knew of\nnone to excel it. What the Science Community was, no one knew exactly;\nbut that there was something abnormal, fanatical, about it, no one\ndoubted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Science Community, situated in Virginia, in the foothills of the\nBlue Ridge, had first been heard of many years ago, when it was already\na going concern. At the time of which I now speak, the novelty had worn\noff, and no one paid any more attention to it than they do to Zion City\nor the Dunkards. By this time, the Science Community was a city of a\nmillion inhabitants, with a vast outlying area of farms and gardens. It\nwas modern to the highest degree in construction and operation; there\nwas very little manual labor there; no poverty; every person had all the\nbenefits of modern developments in power, transportation, and\ncommunication, and of all other resources provided by scientific\nprogress.\n\nSo much, visitors and reporters were able to say.\n\nThe rumors that it was a vast socialistic organization, without private\nproperty, with equal sharing of all privileges, were never confirmed. It\nis a curious observation that it was possible, in this country of ours,\nfor a city to exist about which we knew so little. However, it seemed\nevident from the vast number and elaboration of public buildings, the\nperfection of community utilities such as transportation, streets,\nlighting, and communication, from the absence of individual homes and\nthe housing of people in huge dormitories, that some different, less\nindividualistic type of social organization than ours was involved. It\nwas obvious that as an organization, the Science Community must also be\nwealthy. If any of its individual citizens were wealthy, no one knew it.\n\nI knew Benda as well as I knew myself, and if I was sure of anything in\nmy life, it was that he was not the type of man to leave a fifty\nthousand dollar job and join a communist city on an equal footing with\nthe clerks in the stores. As it happens, I was also intimately\nacquainted with John Edgewater Smith, recently Power Commissioner of New\nYork City and the most capable power engineer in North America, who,\nfollowing Benda by two or three months, resigned his position, and\naccepted what his letter termed the place of Director of Power in the\nScience Community. I was personally in a position to state that neither\nof these men could be lightly persuaded into such a step, and that\nneither of them would work for a small salary.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBenda's first letter to me stated that he was at the Science Community\non a visit. He had heard of the place, and while at Washington on\nbusiness had taken advantage of the opportunity to drive out and see it.\nFascinated by the equipment he saw there, he had decided to stay a few\ndays and study it. The next letter announced his acceptance of the\nposition. I would give a month's salary to get a look at those letters\nnow; but I neglected to preserve them. I should like to see them because\nI am curious as to whether they exhibit the characteristics of the\nsubsequent letters, some of which I now have.\n\nAs I have stated, Benda and I had been on the most intimate terms for\nforty years. His letters had always been crisp and direct, and\nthoroughly familiar and confidential. I do not know just how many\nletters I received from him from the Science Community before I noted\nthe difference, but I have one from the third month of his stay there\n(he wrote every two or three weeks), characterized by a verbosity that\nsounded strange for him. He seemed to be writing merely to cover the\nsheet, trifles such as he had never previously considered worth writing\nletters about. Four pages of letter conveyed not a single idea. Yet\nBenda was, if anything, a man of ideas.\n\nThere followed several months of letters like that: a lot of words,\nevasion of coming to the point about anything; just conventional\nletters. Benda was the last man to write a conventional letter. Yet, it\nwas Benda writing them: gruff little expressions of his, clear ways of\nlooking at even the veriest trifles, little allusion to our common past:\nthese things could neither have been written by anyone else, nor written\nunder compulsion from without. Something had changed Benda.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI pondered on it a good deal, and could think of no hypothesis to\naccount for it. In the meanwhile, New York City lost a third technical\nman to the Science Community. Donald Francisco, Commissioner of the\nWater Supply, a sanitary engineer of international standing, accepted a\nposition in the Science Community as Water Director. I did not know\nwhether to laugh and compare it to the National Baseball League's\ntrafficking in \"big names,\" or to hunt for some sinister danger sign in\nit. But, as a result of my ponderings, I decided to visit Benda at The\nScience Community.\n\nI wrote him to that effect, and almost decided to change my mind about\nthe visit because of the cold evasiveness of the reply I received from\nhim. My first impulse on reading his indifferent, lackadaisical comment\non my proposed visit was to feel offended, and determine to let him\nalone and never see him again. The average man would have done that, but\nmy long years of training in psychological interpretation told me that a\ncharacter and a friendship built during forty years does not change in\nsix months, and that there must be some other explanation for this. I\nwrote him that I was coming. I found that the best way to reach the\nScience Community was to take a bus out from Washington. It involved a\ndrive of about fifty miles northwest, through a picturesque section of\nthe country. The latter part of the drive took me past settlements that\nlooked as though they might be in about the same stage of progress as\nthey had been during the American Revolution. The city of my destination\nwas back in the hills, and very much isolated. During the last ten miles\nwe met no traffic at all, and I was the only passenger left in the bus.\nSuddenly the vehicle stopped.\n\n\"Far as we go!\" the driver shouted.\n\nI looked about in consternation. All around were low, wild-looking\nhills. The road went on ahead through a narrow pass.\n\n\"They'll pick you up in a little bit,\" the driver said as he turned\naround and drove off, leaving me standing there with my bag, very much\nastonished at it all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was right. A small, neat-looking bus drove through the pass and\nstopped for me. As I got in, the driver mechanically turned around and\ndrove into the hills again.\n\n\"They took up my ticket on the other bus,\" I said to the driver. \"What\ndo I owe you?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said curtly. \"Fill that out.\" He handed me a card.\n\nAn impertinent thing, that card was. Besides asking for my name,\naddress, nationality, vocation, and position, it requested that I state\nwhom I was visiting in the Science Community, the purpose of my visit,\nthe nature of my business, how long I intended to stay, did I have a\nplace to stay arranged for, and if so, where and through whom. It looked\nfor all the world as though they had something to conceal; Czarist\nRussia couldn't beat that for keeping track of people and prying into\ntheir business. Sign here, the card said.\n\nIt annoyed me, but I filled it out, and, by the time I was through, the\nbus was out of the hills, traveling up the valley of a small river; I am\nnot familiar enough with northern Virginia to say which river it was.\nThere was much machinery and a few people in the broad fields. In the\ndistance ahead was a mass of chimneys and the cupolas of iron-works, but\nno smoke.\n\nThere were power-line towers with high-tension insulators, and, far\nahead, the masses of huge elevators and big, square buildings. Soon I\ncame in sight of a veritable forest of huge windmills.\n\nIn a few moments, the huge buildings loomed up over me; the bus entered\na street of the city abruptly from the country. One moment on a country\nroad, the next moment among towering buildings. We sped along swiftly\nthrough a busy metropolis, bright, airy, efficient looking. The traffic\nwas dense but quiet, and I was confident that most of the vehicles were\nelectric; for there was no noise nor gasoline odor. Nor was there any\nsmoke. Things looked airy, comfortable, efficient; but rather\nmonotonous, dull. There was a total lack of architectural interest. The\nbuildings were just square blocks, like neat rows of neat boxes. But, it\nall moved smoothly, quietly, with wonderful efficiency.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy first thought was to look closely at the people who swarmed the\nstreets of this strange city. Their faces were solemn, and their clothes\nwere solemn. All seemed intently busy, going somewhere, or doing\nsomething; there was no standing about, no idle sauntering. And look\nwhichever way I might, everywhere there was the same blue serge, on men\nand women alike, in all directions, as far as I could see.\n\nThe bus stopped before a neat, square building of rather smaller size,\nand the next thing I knew, Benda was running down the steps to meet me.\nHe was his old gruff, enthusiastic self.\n\n\"Glad to see you, Hagstrom, old socks!\" he shouted, and gripped my hand\nwith two of his. \"I've arranged for a room for you, and we'll have a\ngood old visit, and I'll show you around this town.\"\n\nI looked at him closely. He looked healthy and well cared-for, all\nexcept for a couple of new lines of worry on his face. Undoubtedly that\nworn look meant some sort of trouble.\n\n\nPART II\n\n_The New Religion_\n\n(This part is interpolated by the author into Dr. Hagstrom's narrative.)\n\nEvery great religion has as its psychological reason for existence the\nmission of compensating for some crying, unsatisfied human need.\nChristianity spread and grew among people who were, at the time,\npersecuted subjects or slaves of Rome; and it flourished through the\nMiddle Ages at a time when life held for the individual chiefly pain,\nuncertainty, and bereavement. Christianity kept the common man consoled\nand mentally balanced by minimizing the importance of life on earth and\noffering compensation afterwards and elsewhere.\n\nA feeble nation of idle dreamers, torn by a chaos of intertribal feuds\nwithin, menaced by powerful, conquest-lusting nations from without,\nArabia was enabled by Islam, the religion of her prophet Mohammed, to\nunite all her sons into an intense loyalty to one cause, and to turn her\ndream-stuff into reality by carrying her national pride and honor beyond\nher boundaries and spreading it over half the known world.\n\nThe ancient Greeks, in despair over the frailties of human emotion and\nthe unbecomingness of worldly conduct, which their brilliant minds\nenabled them to recognize clearly but which they found themselves\npowerless to subdue, endowed the gods, whom they worshipped, with all of\ntheir own passions and weaknesses, and thus the foolish behavior of the\ngods consoled them for their own obvious shortcomings. So it goes\nthroughout all of the world's religions.\n\nIn the middle of the twentieth century there were in the civilized\nworld, millions of people in whose lives Christianity had ceased to play\nany part. Yet, psychically--remember, \"psyche\" means \"soul\"--they were\njust as sick and unbalanced, just as much in need of some compensation\nas were the subjects of the early Roman empire, or the Arabs in the\nMiddle Ages. They were forced to work at the strained and monotonous\npace of machines; they were the slaves, body and soul, of machines; they\nlived with machines and lived like machines--they were expected to _be_\nmachines. A mechanized mode of life set a relentless pace for them,\nwhile, just as in all the past ages, life and love, the breezes and the\nblue sky called to them; but they could not respond. They had to drive\nmachines so that machines could serve them. Minds were cramped and\nemotions were starved, but hands must go on guiding levers and keeping\nmachines in operation. Lives were reduced to such a mechanical routine\nthat men wondered how long human minds and human bodies could stand the\nrestraint. There is a good deal in the writings of the times to show\nthat life was becoming almost unbearable for three-fourths of humanity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is only natural, therefore, that Rohan, the prophet of the new\nreligion, found followers more rapidly than he could organize them.\nAbout ten years before the visit of Dr. Hagstrom to his friend Benda,\nRohan and his new religion had been much in the newspapers. Rohan was a\nSlovak, apparently well educated in Europe. When he first attracted\nattention to himself, he was foreman in a steel plant at Birmingham,\nAlabama. He was popular as an orator, and drew unheard-of crowds to his\nlectures.\n\nHe preached of _Science_ as God, an all-pervading, inexorably systematic\nBeing, the true Center and Motive-Power of the Universe; a Being who saw\nmen and pitied them because they could not help committing inaccuracies.\nThe Science God was helping man become more perfect. Even now, men were\nmuch more accurate and systematic than they had been a hundred years\nago; men's lives were ordered and rhythmic, like natural laws, not like\nthe chaotic emotions of beasts and savages.\n\nSomehow, he soon dropped out of the attention of the great mass of the\npublic. Of course, he did so intentionally, when his ideas began to\ncrystallize and his plans for his future organization began to form. At\nfirst he had a sort of church in Birmingham, called The Church of the\nScientific God. There never was anything cheap nor blatant about him.\nWhen he moved his church from Birmingham to the Lovett Branch Valley in\nnorthern Virginia, he was hardly noticed. But with him went seven\nthousand people, to form the nucleus of the Science Community.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSince then, some feature writer for a metropolitan Sunday paper has\noccasionally written up the Science Community, both from its physical\nand its human aspects. From these reports, the outstanding bit of\nevidence is that Rohan believes intensely in his own religion, and that\nhis followers are all loyal worshippers of the Science God. They\nconceive the earth to be a workshop in which men serve Science, their\nGod, serving a sort of apprenticeship during which He perfects them to\nthe state of ideal machines. To be a perfect machine, always accurate,\nwith no distracting emotions, no getting off the track--that was the\nideal which the Great God _Science_ required of his worshippers. To be a\nperfect machine, or a perfect cog in a machine, to get rid of all\nindividuality, all disturbing sentiment, that was their idea of supreme\nhappiness. Despite the obvious narrowness it involved, there was\nsomething sublime in the conception of this religion. It certainly had\nnothing in common with the \"Christian Science\" that was in vogue during\nthe early years of the twentieth Century; it towered with a noble\ngrandeur above that feeble little sham.\n\nThe Science Community was organized like a machine: and all men played\ntheir parts, in government, in labor, in administration, in production,\nlike perfect cogs and accurate wheels, and the machine functioned\nperfectly. The devotees were described as fanatical, but happy. They\ncertainly were well trained and efficient. The Science Community grew.\nIn ten years it had a million people, and was a worldwide wonder of\ncivic planning and organization; it contained so many astonishing\ndevelopments in mechanical service to human welfare and comfort that it\nwas considered as a sort of model of the future city. The common man\nthere was provided with science-produced luxuries, in his daily life,\nthat were in the rest of the world the privilege of the wealthy few--but\nhe used his increased energy and leisure in serving the more devotedly,\nhis God, Science, who had made machines. There was a great temple in the\ncity, the shape of a huge dynamo-generator, whose interior was worked\nout in a scheme of mechanical devices, and with music, lights, and odors\nto help in the worship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat the world knew the least about was that this religion was becoming\nmilitant. Its followers spoke of the heathen without, and were horrified\nat the prevalence of the sin of individualism. They were inspired with\nthe mission that the message of God--scientific perfection--must be\ncarried to the whole world. But, knowing that vested interests,\ngovernments, invested capital, and established religions would oppose\nthem and render any real progress impossible, they waited. They studied\nthe question, looking for some opportunity to spread the gospel of their\nbeliefs, prepared to do so by force, finding their justification in\ntheir belief that millions of sufferers needed the comforts that their\nreligion had given them. Meanwhile their numbers grew.\n\nRohan was Chief Engineer, which position was equal in honor and dignity\nto that of Prophet or High Priest. He was a busy, hard-worked man, black\nhaired and gaunt, small of stature and fiery eyed; he looked rather\nlike an overworked department-store manager rather than like a prophet.\nHe was finding his hands more full every day, both because of the\nextraordinary fertility of his own plans and ideas, and because the\nScience Community was growing so rapidly. Among this heterogenous mass\nof proselyte strangers that poured into the city and was efficiently\nabsorbed into the machine, it was yet difficult to find executives,\nleaders, men to put in charge of big things. And he needed constantly\nmore and more of such men.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat was why Rohan went to Benda, and subsequently to others like Benda.\nRohan had a deep knowledge of human nature. He did not approach Benda\nwith the offer of a magnanimous salary, but came into Benda's office\nasking for a consultation on some of the puzzling communication problems\nof the Science Community. Benda became interested, and on his own\ninitiative offered to visit the Science Community, saying that he had to\nbe in Washington anyway in a few days. When he saw what the conditions\nwere in the Science Community, he became fascinated by its advantages\nover New York; a new system to plan from the ground up; no obsolete\ninstallation to wrestle with; an absolutely free hand for the engineer\nin charge; no politics to play; no concessions to antiquated city\nconstruction, nor to feeble-minded city administration--just a dream of\nan opportunity. He almost asked for the job himself, but Rohan was\ntactful enough to offer it, and the salary, though princely, was hardly\ngiven a thought.\n\nFor many weeks Benda was absorbed in his job, to the exclusion of all\nelse. He sent his money to his New York bank and had his family move in\nand live with him. He was happy in his communication problems.\n\n\"Give me a problem in communication and you make me happy,\" he wrote to\nHagstrom in one of his early letters.\n\nHe had completed a certain division of his work on the Science\nCommunity's communication system, and it occurred to him that a few\ndays' relaxation would do him good. A run up to New York would be just\nthe thing.\n\nTo his amazement, he was not permitted to board the outbound bus.\n\n\"You'll need orders from the Chief Engineer's office,\" the driver said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBenda went to Rohan.\n\n\"Am I a prisoner?\" he demanded with his characteristic directness.\n\n\"An embarassing situation,\" the suave Rohan admitted, very calmly and at\nhis ease. \"You see, I'm nothing like a dictator here. I have no\narbitrary power. Everything runs by system, and you're a sort of\nexception. No one knows exactly how to classify you. Neither do I. But,\nI can't break a rule. That is sin.\"\n\n\"What rule? I want to go to New York.\"\n\n\"Only those of the Faith who have reached the third degree can come and\ngo. No one can get that in less than three years.\"\n\n\"Then you got me in here by fraud?\" Benda asked bluntly.\n\nRohan side-stepped gracefully.\n\n\"You know our innermost secrets now,\" he explained. \"Do you suppose\nthere is any hope of your embracing the Faith?\"\n\nBenda whirled on his heel and walked out.\n\n\"I'll think about it!\" he said, his voice snapping with sarcasm.\n\nBenda went back to his work in order to get his mind off the matter. He\nwas a well-balanced man if he was anything; and he knew that nothing\ncould be accomplished by rash words or incautious moves against Rohan\nand his organization. And on that day he met John Edgewater Smith.\n\n\"You here?\" Benda gasped. He lost his equilibrium for a moment in\nconsternation at the sight of his fellow-engineer.\n\nSmith was too elated to notice Benda's mood.\n\n\"I've been here a week. This is certainly an ideal opportunity in my\nline of work. Even in Heaven I never expected to find such a chance.\"\n\nBy this time Benda had regained control of himself. He decided to say\nnothing to Smith for the time being.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey did not meet again for several weeks. In the meantime Benda\ndiscovered that his mail was being censored. At first he did not know\nthat his letters, always typewritten, were copied and objectionable\nmatter omitted, and his signature reproduced by the photo-engraving\nprocess, separately each time. But before long, several letters came\nback to him rubber-stamped: \"Not passable. Please revise.\" It took Benda\ntwo days to cool down and rewrite the first letter. But outwardly no one\nwould have ever known that there was anything amiss with him.\n\nHowever, he took to leaving his work for an hour or two a day and\nwalking in the park, to think out the matter. He didn't like it. This\nwas about the time that it began to be a real issue as to who was the\nbigger man of the two, Rohan or Benda. But no signs of the issue\nappeared externally for many months.\n\nJohn Edgewater Smith realized sooner than Benda that he couldn't get\nout, because, not sticking to work so closely, he had made the attempt\nsooner. He looked very much worried when Benda next saw him.\n\n\"What's this? Do you know about it?\" he shouted as soon as he had come\nwithin hearing distance of Benda.\n\n\"What's the difference?\" Benda replied casually. \"Aren't you satisfied?\"\n\nSmith's face went blank.\n\nBenda came close to him, linked arms and led him to a broad vacant lawn\nin the park.\n\n\"Listen!\" he said softly in Smith's ear. \"Don't you suppose these\npeople who lock us in and censor our mail aren't smart enough to spy on\nwhat we say to each other?\"\n\n\"Our only hope,\" Benda continued, \"is to learn all we can of what is\ngoing on here. Keep your eyes and ears open and meet me here in a week.\nAnd now come on; we've been whispering here long enough.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOddly enough, the first clue to the puzzle they were trying to solve was\nsupplied by Francisco, New York's former Water Commissioner. Why were\nthey being kept prisoners in the city? There must be more reason for\nholding them there than the fear that information would be carried out,\nfor none of the three engineers knew anything about the Science\nCommunity that could be of any possible consequence to outsiders. They\nhad all stuck rigidly to their own jobs.\n\nThey met Francisco, very blue and dejected, walking in the park a couple\nof months later. They had been having weekly meetings, feeling that more\nfrequent rendezvous might excite suspicion. Francisco was overjoyed to\nsee them.\n\n\"Been trying to figure out why they want us,\" he said. \"There is\nsomething deeper than the excuse they have made; that rot about a\nperfect system and no breaking of rules may be true, but it has nothing\nto do with us. Now, here are three of us, widely admitted as having good\nheads on us. We've got to solve this.\"\n\n\"The first fact to work on,\" he continued, \"is that there is no real job\nfor me here. This city has no water problem that cannot be worked out by\nan engineer's office clerk. Why are they holding me here, paying me a\nprofligate salary, for a job that is a joke for a grown-up man? There's\nsomething behind it that is not apparent on the surface.\"\n\nThe weekly meetings of the three engineers became an established\ninstitution. Mindful that their conversation was doubtless the object of\nattention on the part of the ruling powers of the city through spies\nand concealed microphones, they were careful to discuss trivial matters\nmost of the time, and mentioned their problem only when alone in the\nopen spaces of the park.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter weeks of effort had produced no results, they arrived at the\nconclusion that they would have to do some spying themselves. The great\ntemple, shaped like a dynamo-generator attracted their attention as the\nfirst possibility for obtaining information. Benda, during his work with\ntelephone and television installation, found that the office of some\nsort of ruling council or board of directors were located there. Later\nhe found that it was called the Science Staff. He managed to slip in\nseveral concealed microphone detectors and wire them to a private\nreceiver on his desk, doing all the work with his own hands under the\npretense of hunting for a cleverly contrived short-circuit that his\nsubordinates had failed to find.\n\n\"They open their meeting,\" he said, reporting several days of listening\nto his comrades, \"with a lot of religious stuff. They really believe\nthey are chosen by God to perfect the earth. Their fanaticism has the\nMohammedans beat forty ways. As I get it from listening in, this city is\njust a preliminary base from which to carry, forcibly, the gospel of\nScientific Efficiency to the whole world. They have been divinely\nappointed to organize the earth.\n\n\"The first thing on the program is the seizure of New York City. And, it\nwon't be long; I've heard the details of a cut-and-dried plan. When they\nhave New York, the rest of America can be easily captured, for cities\naren't as independent of each other as they used to be. Getting the rest\nof the world into their hands will then be merely a matter of routine;\njust a little time, and it will be done. Mohammed's wars weren't in it\nwith this!\"\n\nFrancisco and Smith stared at him aghast. These dull-faced,\nblue-sergeclad people did not look capable of it; unless possibly one\nnoted the fiery glint in their eyes. A worldwide Crusade on a scientific\nbasis! The idea left them weak and trembling.\n\n\"Got to learn more details before we can do anything,\" Benda said. \"Come\non; we've been whispering here long enough; they'll get suspicious.\"\nBenda's brain was now definitely pitted against this marvelous\norganisation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I've got it!\" Benda reported at a later meeting. \"I pieced it together\nfrom a few hours listening. Devilish scheme!\n\n\"Can you imagine what would happen in New York in case of a break-down\nin water-supply, electric power, and communication? In an hour there\nwould be a panic; in a day the city would be a hideous shambles of\nsuffering, starvation, disease, and trampling maniacs. Dante's Inferno\nwould be a lovely little pleasure-resort in comparison.\n\n\"Also, have you ever stopped to think how few people there are in the\nworld who understand the handling of these vital elements of our modern\ncivilized organization sufficiently to keep them in operation? There you\nhave the scheme. Because they do not want to destroy the city, but\nmerely to threaten it, they are holding the three of us. A little\nskilful management will eliminate all other possible men who could\noperate the city's machinery, except ourselves. We three will be placed\nin charge. A threat, perhaps a demonstration in some limited section of\nwhat horrors are possible. The city is at their mercy, and promptly\nsurrenders.\n\n\"An alternative plan was discussed: just a little quiet violence could\neliminate those who are now in charge of the city's works, and the panic\nand horrors would commence. But, within an hour of the city's\ncapitulation, the three of us could have things running smoothly again.\nAnd there would be no New York; in its place would be Science Community\nNumber Two. From it they could step on to the next city.\"\n\nThe other two stared at him. There was only one comment.\n\n\"They seem to be sure that they could depend on us,\" Smith said.\n\n\"They may be correct,\" Benda replied. \"Would you stand by and see people\nperish if a turn of your hand could save them? You would for the moment,\nforget the issue between the old order and the new religion.\"\n\nThey separated, horrified by the ghastly simplicity of the plan.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust following this, Benda received the telegram announcing the\nprospective visit of his lifelong friend, Dr. Hagstrom. He took it at\nonce to Rohan.\n\n\"Will my friend be permitted to depart again, if he once gets in here?\"\nhe demanded with his customary directness.\n\n\"It depends on you,\" Rohan replied blandly. \"We want your friend to see\nour Community, and to go away and carry with him the nicest possible\nreports and descriptions of it to the world. I wonder, do I make myself\nclear?\"\n\n\"That means I've got to feed him taffy while he's here?\" Benda asked\ngruffly.\n\n\"You choose to put it indelicately. He is to see and hear only such\nthings about the Science Community as will please the world and impress\nit favorably. I am sure you will understand that under no other\ncircumstances will he be permitted to leave here.\"\n\nBenda turned around abruptly and walked out without a word.\n\n\"Just a moment,\" Rohan called after him. \"I am sure you appreciate the\nfact that every precaution will be taken to hear the least word that you\nsay to him during his stay here? You are watched only perfunctorily now.\nWhile he is here you will be kept track of carefully, and there will be\nthree methods of checking everything you do or say. I am sure you do not\nunderestimate our caution in this matter.\"\n\nBenda spent the days intervening between then and the arrival of his\nfriend Hagstrom, closed up in his office, in intense study. He figured\nthings on pieces of paper, committed them to memory, and scrupulously\nburned the paper. Then he wandered about the park and plucked at leaves\nand twigs.\n\n\nPART III\n\n_The Cipher Message_\n\n(Related by Peter Hagstrom, Ph.D.)\n\nBenda conducted me personally to a room very much like an ordinary hotel\nroom. He was glad to see me. I could tell that from his grip of welcome,\nfrom his pleased face, from the warmth in his voice, from the eager way\nin which he hovered around me. I sat down on a bed and he on a chair.\n\n\"Now tell me all about it,\" I said.\n\nThe room was very still, and in its privacy, following Benda's\ndemonstrative welcome, I expected some confidential revelations.\nTherefore I was astonished.\n\n\"There isn't much to tell,\" he said gaily. \"My work is congenial,\nfascinating, and there's enough of it to keep me out of mischief. The\npay is good, and the life pleasant and easy.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say for a moment. I had come there with my mind\nmade up that there was something suspicious afoot. But he seemed\nthoroughly happy and satisfied.\n\n\"I'll admit that I treated you a little shabbily in this matter of\nletters,\" he continued. \"I suppose it is because I've had a lot of new\nand interesting problems on my mind, and it's been hard to get my mind\ndown to writing letters. But I've got a good start on my job, and I'll\npromise to reform.\"\n\nI was at a loss to pursue that subject any further.\n\n\"Have you seen Smith and Francisco?\" I asked.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"How do they like it?\"\n\n\"Both are enthusiastic about the wonderful opportunities in their\nrespective fields. It's a fact: no engineer has ever before had such\nresources to work with, on such a vast scale, and with such a free hand.\nWe're laying the framework for a city of ten millions, all thoroughly\nsystematized and efficient. There is no city in the world like it; it's\nan engineer's dream of Utopia.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was almost convinced. There was only the tiniest of lurking suspicions\nthat all was not well, but it was not powerful enough to stimulate me to\nsay anything. But I did determine to keep my eyes open.\n\nI might as well admit in advance that from that moment to the time when\nI left the Science Community four days later, I saw nothing to confirm\nmy suspicions. I met Smith and Francisco at dinner and the four of us\noccupied a table to ourselves in a vast dining hall, and no one paid for\nthe meal nor for subsequent ones. They also seemed content, and talked\nenthusiastically of their work.\n\nI was shown over the city, through its neat, efficient streets, through\nits comfortable dormitories each housing hundreds of families as\nluxuriously as any modern hotel, through its marvelous factories where\nproduction had passed the stage of labor and had assumed the condition\nof a devoted act of worship. These factory workers were not toiling:\nthey were worshipping their God, of Whom each machine was a part.\nTouching their machine was touching their God. This machinery, while\ninvolving no new principles, was developed and coordinated to a degree\nthat exceeded anything I had ever seen anywhere else.\n\nI saw the famous Science Temple in the shape of a huge\ndynamo-generator, with its interior decorations, paintings, carvings,\nfrescoes, and pillars, all worked out on the motive of machinery; with\nits constant streams of worshippers in blue serge, performing their\nconventional rites and saying their prayer formulas at altars in the\nforms of lathes, microscopes, motors, and electron-tubes.\n\n\"You haven't become a Science Communist yourself?\" I bantered Benda.\n\nThere was a metallic ring in the laugh he gave.\n\n\"They'd like to have me!\" was all he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was rather surprised at the emptiness of the large and well-kept park\nto which Benda took me. It was beautifully landscaped, but only a few\nscattering people were there, lost in its vast reaches.\n\n\"These people seem to have no need of recreation,\" Benda said. \"They do\nnot come here much. But I confess that I need air and relaxation, even\nif only for short snatches. I've been too busy to get away for long at a\ntime, but this park has helped me keep my balance--I'm here every day\nfor at least a few minutes.\"\n\n\"Beautiful place,\" I remarked. \"A lot of strange trees and plants I\nnever saw before--\"\n\n\"Oh, mostly tropical forms, common enough in their own habitats. They\nhave steam pipes under the ground to grow them. I've been trying to\nlearn something about them. Fancy _me_ studying natural history! I've\nnever cared for it, but here, where there is no such things as\nrecreation, I have become intensely interested in it as a hobby. I find\nit very much of a rest to study these plants and bugs.\"\n\n\"Why don't you run up to New York for a few days?\"\n\n\"Oh, the time will come for that. In the meanwhile, I've got an idea all\nof a sudden. Speaking of New York, will you do me a little service? Even\nthough you might think it silly?\"\n\n\"I'll do anything I can,\" I began, eager to be of help to him.\n\n\"It has been somewhat of a torture to me,\" Benda continued, \"to find so\nmany of these forms which I am unable to identify. I like to be\nscientific, even in my play, and reference books on plants and insects\nare scarce here. Now, if you would carry back a few specimens for me,\nand ask some of the botany and zoology people to send me their names--\"\n\n\"Fine!\" I exclaimed. \"I've got a good-sized pocket notebook I can carry\nthem in.\"\n\n\"Well then, please put them in the order in which I hand them to you,\nand send me the names by number. I am pretty thoroughly familiar with\nthem, and if you will keep them in order, there is no need for me to\nkeep a list. The first is a blade of this queer grass.\"\n\nI filed the grass blade between the first two pages of my book.\n\n\"The next is this unusual-looking pinnate leaf.\" He tore off a dry\nleaflet and handed me a stem with three leaflets irregularly disposed of\nit.\n\n\"Now leave a blank page in your book. That will help me remember the\norder in which they come.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNext came a flat insect, which, strangely enough, had two legs missing\non one side. However, Benda was moving so fast that I had to put it away\nwithout comment. He kept darting about and handing me twigs of leaves,\nlittle sticks, pieces of bark, insects, not seeming to care much whether\nthey were complete or not; grass-blades, several dagger-shaped\nlocust-thorns, cross-sections of curious fruits, moving so rapidly that\nin a few moments my notebook bulged widely, and I had to warn him that\nits hundred leaves were almost filled.\n\n\"Well, that ought to be enough,\" he said with a sigh after his lively\nexertion. \"You don't know how I'll appreciate your indulging my foolish\nlittle whim.\"\n\n\"Say!\" I exclaimed. \"Ask something of me. This it nothing. I'll take it\nright over to the Botany Department, and in a few days you ought to have\na list of names fit for a Bolshevik.\"\n\n\"One important caution,\" he said. \"If you disturb their order in the\nbook, or even the position on the page, the names you send me will mean\nnothing to me. Not that it will be any great loss,\" he added\nwhimsically. \"I suppose I've become a sort of fan on this, like the\nbusiness men who claim that their office work interferes with their\ngolf.\"\n\nWe walked leisurely back toward the big dormitory. It was while we were\ncrossing a street that Benda stumbled, and, to dodge a passing truck,\nhad to catch my arm, and fell against me. I heard his soft voice whisper\nin my ear:\n\n\"Get out of this town as soon as you can!\"\n\nI looked at him in startled amazement, but he was walking along, shaking\nhimself from his stumble, and looking up and down the street for passing\ntrucks.\n\n\"As I was saying,\" he said in a matter-of-fact voice, \"we expect to\nreach the one-and-one-quarter million mark this month. I never saw a\nplace grow so fast.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI felt a great leap of sudden understanding. For a moment my muscles\ntightened, but I took my cue.\n\n\"Remarkable place,\" I said calmly; \"one reads a lot of half-truths about\nit. Too bad I can't stay any longer.\"\n\n\"Sorry you have to leave,\" he said, in exactly the right tone of voice.\n\"But you can come again.\"\n\nHow thankful I was for the forty years of playing and working together\nthat had accustomed us to that sort of team-work! Unconsciously we\nresponded to one another's cues. Once our ability to \"play together\" had\nsaved my life. It was when we were in college and were out on a\ncross-country hike together; Benda suddenly caught my hand and swung it\nupward. I recognized the gesture; we were cheerleaders and worked\ntogether at football games, and we had one stunt in which we swung our\nhands over our heads, jumped about three feet, and let out a whoop. This\nwas the \"stunt\" that he started out there in the country, where we were\nby ourselves. Automatically, without thinking, I swung my arms and\nleaped with him and yelled. Only later did I notice the rattlesnake over\nwhich I had jumped. I had not seen that I was about to walk right into\nit, and he had noticed it too late to explain. A flash of genius\nsuggested the cheering stunt to him.\n\n\"_Communication_ is a science!\" he had said, and that was all the\ncomment there was on the incident.\n\nSo now, I followed my cue, without knowing why, nor what it was all\nabout, but confident that I should soon find out. By noon I was on the\nbus, on my way through the pass, to meet the vehicle from Washington. As\nthe bus swung along, a number of things kept jumbling through my mind:\nBenda's effusive glee at seeing me, and his sudden turning and bundling\nme off in a nervous hurry without a word of explanation; his lined and\nworried face and yet his insistence on the joys of his work in The\nScience Community; his obvious desire to be hospitable and play the good\nhost, and yet his evasiveness and unwillingness to chat intimately and\ndiscuss important things as he used to. Finally, that notebook full of\nodd specimens bulging in my pocket. And the memory of his words as he\nshook hands with me when I was stepping into the bus:\n\n\"Long live the science of communication!\" he had said. Otherwise, he was\nrather glum and silent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI took out the book of specimens and looked at it. His caution not to\ndisturb the order and position of things rang in my ears. The Science of\nCommunication! Two and two were beginning to make four in my mind. All\nthe way on the train from Washington to New York I could hardly, keep\nmy hands off the book. I had definitely abandoned the idea of hunting up\nbotanists and zoologists at Columbia. Benda was not interested in the\nnames of these things. That book meant something else. Some message. The\nScience of Communication!\n\nThat suddenly explained all the contradictions in his behavior. He was\nbeing closely watched. Any attempt to tell me the things he wanted to\nsay would be promptly recognized. He had succeeded brilliantly in\ngetting a message to me. Now, my part was to read it! I felt a sudden\nsinking within me. That book full of leaves, bugs, and sticks? How could\nI make anything out of it?\n\n\"There's the Secret Service,\" I thought. \"They are skilled in reading\nhidden messages. It must be an important one, worthy of the efforts of\nthe Secret Service, or he would not have been at such pains to get it to\nme--\n\n\"But no. The Secret Service is skilled at reading hidden messages, but\nnot as skilled as I am in reading my friend's mind. Knowing Benda, his\nclear intellect, his logical methods, will be of more service in solving\nthis than all the experts of the Secret Service.\"\n\nI barely stopped to eat dinner when I reached home. I hurried to the\nlaboratory building, and laid out the specimens on white sheets of\npaper, meticulously preserving order, position, and spacing. To be on\nthe safe side I had them photographed, asking the photographer to vary\nthe scale of his pictures so that all of the final figures would be\napproximately the same size. Plate I. shows what I had.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was all a-tremble when the mounted photographs were handed to me. The\nfirst thing I did was to number the specimens, giving each blank space\nalso its consecutive number. Certainly no one could imagine a more\nmeaningless jumble of twigs, leaves, berries, and bugs. How could I\nread any message out of that?\n\nYet I had no doubt that the message concerned something of far more\nimportance than Benda's own safety. He had moved in this matter with\nastonishing skill and breathless caution; yet I knew him to be reckless\nto the extreme where only his own skill was concerned. I couldn't even\nimagine his going to this elaborate risk merely on account of Smith and\nFrancisco. Something bigger must be involved.\n\nI stared at the rows of specimens.\n\n\"Communication is a science!\" Benda had said, and it came back to me as\nI studied the bent worms and the beetles with two legs missing. I was\nconfident that the solution would be simple. Once the key idea occurred\nto me I knew I should find the whole thing astonishingly direct and\nsystematic. For a moment I tried to attach some sort of heiroglyphic\nsignificance to the specimen forms; in the writing of the American\nIndians, a wavy line meant water, an inverted V meant a wigwam. But, I\ndiscarded that idea in a moment. Benda's mind did not work along the\npaths of symbolism. It would have to be something mathematical, rigidly\nlogical, leaving no room for guess-work.\n\nNo sooner had the key-idea occurred to me than the basic conception\nunderlying all these rows of twigs and bugs suddenly flashed into clear\nmeaning before me. The simplicity of it took my breath away.\n\n\"I knew it!\" I said aloud, though I was alone. \"Very simple.\"\n\nI was prepared for the fact that each one of the specimens represented a\nletter of the alphabet. If nothing else, their number indicated that.\nNow I could see, so clearly that the photographs shouted at me, that\neach specimen consisted of an upright stem, and from this middle stem\nprojected side-arms to the right and to the left, and in various\nvertical locations on each side.\n\nThe middle upright stem contained these side-arms in various numbers\nand combinations. In five minutes I had a copy of the message,\ntranslated into its fundamental characters, as shown on Plate II.\n\n[Illustration: Plate I]\n\nThe first grass-blade was the simple, upright stem; the second, three\nleaflets on their stem, represented the upright portion with two arms to\nthe left at the top and middle, and one arm to the right at the top; and\nso on.\n\nThat brought the message down to the simple and straightforward matter\nof a substitution cipher. I was confident that Benda had no object in\nintroducing any complications that could possibly be avoided, as his\nsole purpose was to get to me the most readable message without getting\ncaught at it. I recollected now how cautious he had been to hand me no\npaper, and how openly and obviously he had dropped each specimen into my\nbook; because he knew someone was watching him and expecting him to slip\nin a message. He had, as I could see now in the retrospect, been\nconspicuously careful that nothing suspicious should pass from his hands\nto mine.\n\n[Illustration: Plate II]\n\nSubstitution ciphers are easy to solve, especially for those having some\nexperience. The method can be found in Edgar Allen Poe's \"Gold Bug\" and\nin a host of its imitators. A Secret Service cipher man could have read\nit in an hour. But I knew my friend's mind well enough to find a\nshort-cut. I knew just how he would go about devising such a cipher, in\nfact, how ninety-nine persons out of a hundred with a scientific\neducation would do it.\n\nIf we begin adding horizontal arms to the middle stem, from top to\nbottom and from left to right, the possible characters can be worked out\nby the system shown on Plate III.\n\n[Illustration: Plate III]\n\nIt is most logical to suppose that Benda would begin with the first sign\nand substitute the letters of the alphabet in order. That would give us\nthe cipher code shown on Plate IV.\n\nIt was all very quick work, just as I had anticipated, once the key-idea\nhad occurred to me. The ease and speed of my method far exceeded that\nof Poe's method, but, of course, was applicable only to this particular\ncase. Substituting letters for signs out of my diagram, I got the\nfollowing message:\n\n     AM PRISONER R PLANS CAPTURE OF N Y BY SEIZING POWER WATER AND\n     PHONES THEN WORLD CONQUEST S O S\n\n[Illustration: Plate IV]\n\n\nPART IV\n\n_L'Envoi_\n\n(By Peter Hagstrom, M.D.)\n\nMy solution of the message practically ends the story. Events followed\neach other from then on like bullets from a machine-gun. A wild drive in\na taxicab brought me to the door of Mayor Anderson at ten o'clock that\nnight. I told him the story and showed him my photographs.\n\nFollowing that I spent many hours telling my story to and consulting\nwith officers in the War Department. Next afternoon, photographic maps\nof the Science Community and its environs, brought by airplanes during\nthe forenoon, were spread on desks before us. A colonel of marines and a\ncolonel of aviation sketched plans in notebooks. After dark I sat in a\ntransport plane with muffled exhaust and propellers, slipping through\nthe air as silently as a hawk. About us were a dozen bombing planes, and\nabout fifty transports, carrying a battalion of marines.\n\nI am not an adventure-loving man. Though a cordon of husky marines about\nme was a protection against any possible danger, yet, stealing along\nthrough that wild valley in the Virginia mountains toward the dark\nmasses of that fanatic city, the silent progress of the long, dark line\nthrough the night, their mysterious disappearance, one by one, as we\nneared the city, the creepy, hair-raising journey through the dark\nstreets--I shall never forget for the rest of my life the sinking\nfeeling in my abdomen and the throbbing in my head. But I wanted to be\nthere, for Benda was my lifelong friend.\n\nI guided them to Rohan's rooms, and saw a dozen dark forms slip in, one\nby one. Then we went on to the dormitory where Benda lived. Benda\nanswered our hammering at his door in his pajamas. He took in the\nCaptain's automatic, and the bayonets behind me, at a glance.\n\n\"Good boy, Hagstrom!\" he said. \"I knew you'd do it. There wasn't much\ntime left. I got my instructions about handling the New York telephone\nsystem to-day.\"\n\nAs we came out into the street. I saw Rohan handcuffed to two big\nmarines, and rows of bayonets gleaming in the darkness down the streets.\nEvery few moments a bright flare shot out from the planes in the sky,\nuntil a squad located the power-house and turned on all the lights they\ncould find.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nJetta of the Lowlands\n\nBEGINNING A THREE-PART NOVEL\n\nBy Ray Cummings\n\n\n_Foreword_\n\n_Have you ever stood on the seashore, with the breakers rolling at your\nfeet, and imagined what the scene would be like if the ocean water were\ngone?

See where I am?\"]\n\n_If the ocean water were gone! Can you picture it? A new world, greater\nin area than all the land we now have. They would call the former\nsea-level the zero-height, perhaps. The depths would go down as far\nbeneath it as Mount Everest towers above it. Aeroplanes would fly down\ninto them._\n\n_And I can imagine the settlement of these vast new realms: New little\nnations being created, born of man's indomitable will to conquer every\nadverse condition of inhospitable nature._\n\n_A novel setting for a story of adventure. It seems so to me. Can you\nsay that the oceans will never drain of their water? That an earthquake\nwill not open a rift--some day in the future--and lower the water into\nsubterranean caverns? The volume of water of all the oceans is no more\nto the volume of the earth than a tissue paper wrapping on an orange._\n\n_Is it too great a fantasy? Why, reading the facts of what happened in\n1929, it is already prognosticated. The fishing banks off the Coast of\nNewfoundland have suddenly sunk. Cable ships repairing a broken cable,\nsnapped by the earthquake of November 18th, 1929, report that for\ndistances of a hundred miles on the Grand Banks the cables have\ndisappeared into unfathomable depths. And before the subterranean\ncataclysm, they were within six hundred feet of the surface. And all the\nbottom of that section of the North Atlantic seems to have caved in. Ten\nthousand square miles dropped out of the bottom of the ocean! Fact, not\nfancy._\n\n_And so let us enlarge the picture. Let us create the Lowlands--twenty\nthousand feet below the zero-height--the setting for a tale of\nadventure. The romance of the mist-shrouded deeps. And the romance of\nlittle Jetta._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n_The Secret Mission_\n\n\nI was twenty-five years of age that May evening of 2020 when they sent\nme south into the Lowlands. I had been in the National Detective Service\nBureau, and then was transferred to the Customs Department, Atlantic\nLowlands Branch. I went alone; it was best, my commander thought. An\nassignment needing diplomacy rather than a show of force.\n\nIt was 9 P. M. when I catapulted from the little stage of Long Island\nairport. A fair, moonlit evening--a moon just beyond the full, rising to\npale the eastern stars. I climbed about a thousand feet, swung over the\nheadlands of the Hook, and, keeping in the thousand-foot local lane,\ntook my course.\n\nMy destination lay some thirteen hundred miles southeast of Great New\nYork. I could do a good normal three-ninety in this fleet little Wasp,\nespecially if I kept in the rarer air-pressures over the zero-height.\nThe thousand-foot lane had a southward drift, this night. I was making\nnow well over four hundred; I would reach Nareda soon after midnight.\n\nThe Continental Shelf slid beneath me, dropping away as my course took\nme further from the Highland borders. The Lowlands lay patched with inky\nshadows and splashes of moonlight. Domes with upstanding, rounded heads;\nplateaus of naked black rock, ten thousand feet below the zero-height;\ntrenches, like valleys, ridged and pitted, naked in places like a\npockmarked lunar landscape. Or again, a pall of black mist would\nshroud it all, dark curtain of sluggish cloud with moonlight tinging its\nedges pallid green.\n\nTo my left, eastward toward the great basin of the mid-Atlantic\nLowlands, there was always a steady downward slope. To the right, it\ncame up over the continental shelf to the Highlands of the United\nStates.\n\nThere was often water to be seen in these Lowlands. A spring-fed lake\nfar down in a caldron pit, spilling into a trench; low-lying,\nland-locked little seas; ca\u00f1ons, some of them dry, others filled with\ntumultuous flowing water. Or great gashes with water sluggishly flowing,\nor standing with a heavy slime, and a pall of uprising vapor in the heat\nof the night.\n\nAt 37\u00b0N. and 70\u00b0W., I passed over the newly named Atlas Sea. A lake of\nwater here, more than a hundred miles in extent. Its surface lay fifteen\nthousand feet below the zero-height; its depth in places was a full\nthree thousand. It was clear of mist to-night. The moonlight shimmered\non its rippled surface, like pictures my father had often shown me of\nthe former oceans.\n\nI passed, a little later, well to the westward of the verdured mountain\ntop of the Bermudas.\n\nThere was nothing of this flight novel to me. I had frequently flown\nover the Lowlands; I had descended into them many times. But never upon\nsuch a mission as was taking me there now.\n\nI was headed for Nareda, capital village of the tiny Lowland Republic of\nNareda, which only five years ago came into national being as a\nprotectorate of the United States. Its territory lies just north of the\nmountain Highlands of Haiti, Santo Domingo and Porto Rico. A few hundred\nmiles of tumbled Lowlands, embracing the turgid Nares Sea, whose bottom\nis the lowest point of all the Western Hemisphere--some thirty thousand\nfeet below the zero-height.\n\nThe village of Nareda is far down indeed. I had never been there. My\ncharts showed it on the southern border of the Nares Sea, at minus\ntwenty thousand feet, with the Mona Valley behind it like a gash in the\nsteep upward slopes to the Highlands of Porto Rico and Haiti.\n\nNareda has a mixed population of typical Lowland adventures, among which\nthe hardy Dutch predominate; and Holland and the United States have\ncombined their influence in the World Court to give it national\nidentity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd out of this had arisen my mission now. Mercury--the quicksilver of\ncommerce--so recently come to tremendous value through its universal use\nin the new antiseptics which bid fair to check all human disease--was\nbeing produced in Nareda. The import duty into the United States was\nbeing paid openly enough. But nevertheless Hanley's agents believed that\nsmuggling was taking place.\n\nIt was to investigate this condition that Hanley was sending me. I had\nintroduction to the Nareda government officials. I was to consult with\nHanley by ether-phone in seeking the hidden source of the contraband\nquicksilver, but, in the main, to use my own judgment.\n\nA mission of diplomacy. I had no mind to pry openly among the people of\nthese Lowland depths, looking for smugglers. I might, indeed, find them\ntoo unexpectedly! Over-curious strangers are not welcomed by the\nLowlanders. Many have gone into the depths and have never returned....\n\nI was above the Nares Sea, by midnight. I was still flying a thousand\nfeet over the zero-height. Twenty-one thousand feet below me lay the\nblack expanse of water. The moon had climbed well toward the zenith,\nnow. Its silver shafts penetrated the hanging mist-stratas. The surface\nof the Nares Sea was visible--dark and sullen looking.\n\nI shifted the angles of incidence of the wings, re-set my propeller\nangles and made the necessary carburetor adjustments, switching on the\nsupercharger which would supply air at normal zero-height pressure to\nthe carburetors throughout my descent.\n\nI swung over Nareda. The lights of the little village, far down, dwarfed\nby distance, showed like bleary, winking eyes through the mists. The\njagged recesses of the Mona valley were dark with shadow. The Nares Sea\nlay like some black monster asleep, and slowly, heavily panting.\nMoonlight was over me, with stars and fleecy white clouds. Calm, placid,\natmospheric night was up here. But beneath, it all seemed so mysterious,\nfantastic, sinister.\n\nMy heart was pounding as I put the Wasp into a spiral and forced my way\ndown.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_The Face at the Window_\n\n\nWith heavy, sluggish engines I panted down and came to rest in the dull\nyellow glow of the field lights. A new world here. The field was flat,\ncaked ooze, cracked and hardened. It sloped upward from the shore toward\nwhere, a quarter of a mile away, I could see the dull lights of the\nsettlement, blurred by the gathered night vapors.\n\nThe field operator shut off his permission signal and came forward. He\nwas a squat, heavy-set fellow in wide trousers and soiled white shirt\nflung open at his thick throat. The sweat streamed from his forehead.\nThis oppressive heat! I had discarded my flying garb in the descent. I\nwore a shirt, knee-length pants, with hose and wide-soled shoes of the\nnewly fashioned Lowland design. What few weapons I dared carry were\ncarefully concealed. No alien could enter Nareda bearing anything\nresembling a lethal weapon.\n\nMy wide, thick-soled shoes did not look suspicious for one who planned\nmuch walking on the caked Lowland ooze. But those fat soles were\ncleverly fashioned to hide a long, keen knife-blade, like a dirk. I\ncould lift a foot and get the knife out of its hidden compartment with\nfair speed. This I had in one shoe.\n\nIn the other, was the small mechanism of a radio safety recorder and\nimage finder, with its attendant individual audiophone transmitter and\nreceiver. A miracle of smallness, these tiny contrivances. With\nbatteries, wires and grids, the whole device could lay in the palm of\none's hand. Once past this field inspection I would rig it for use under\nmy shirt, strapped around my chest. And I had some colored magnesium\nflares.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe field operator came panting.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Philip Grant. From Great New York.\" I showed him my name etched on my\nforearm. He and his fellows searched me, but I got by.\n\n\"You have no documents?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nMy letter to the President of Nareda was written with invisible ink upon\nthe fabric of my shirt. If he had heated it to a temperature of 180\u00b0F.\nor so, and blown the fumes of hydrochloric acid upon it, the writing\nwould have come out plain enough.\n\nI said, \"You'll house and care for my machine?\"\n\nThey would care for it. They told me the price--swindlingly exorbitant\nfor the unwary traveller who might wander down here.\n\n\"All correct,\" I said cheerfully. \"And half that much more for you and\nyour men if you give me good service. Where can I have a room and\nmeals?\"\n\n\"Spawn,\" said the operator. \"He is the best. Fat-bellied from his own\ngood cooking. Take him there, Hugo.\"\n\nI had a gold coin instantly ready; and with a few additional directions\nregarding my flyer, I started off.\n\nIt had been hot and oppressive standing in the field; it was infinitely\nworse climbing the mud-slope into the village; but my carrier, trudging\nin advance of me along the dark, winding path up the slope, shouldered\nmy bag and seemed not to notice the effort. We passed occasional\ntube-lights strung on poles. They illumined the heavy rounded crags. A\ntumbled region, this slope which once was the ocean floor twenty\nthousand feet below the surface. Rifts were here like gulleys; little\nbuttes reared their rounded, dome heads. And there were caves and\ncrevices in which deep sea fish once had lurked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor ten minutes or so we climbed. It was past the midnight hour; the\nvillage was asleep. We entered its outposts. The houses were small\nstructures of clay. In the gloom they looked like drab little beehives\nset in unplanned groups, with paths for streets wandering between them.\n\nThen we came to a more prosperous neighborhood. The street widened and\nstraightened. The clay houses, still with rounded dome like tops, stood\nback from the road, with wooden front fences, and gardens and shrubbery.\nThe windows and doors were like round finger-holes plugged in the clay\nby a giant hand. Occasionally the windows, dimly lighted, stared like\nsleeping giant eyes.\n\nThere were flowers in all the more pretentious private gardens. Their\nperfume, hanging in the heavy night air, lay on the village, making one\nforget the over-curtain of stenching mist. Down by the shore of the\nNares Sea, this world of the depths had seemed darkly sinister. But in\nthe village now, I felt it less ominous. The scent of the flowers, the\nstreet lined in one place by arching giant fronds drowsing and nodding\noverhead--there seemed a strange exotic romance to it. The sultry air\nmight almost have been sensuous.\n\n\"Much further, Hugo?\"\n\n\"No. We are here.\"\n\nHe turned abruptly into a gateway, led me through a garden and to the\ndoorway of a large, rambling, one-story building. The news of my coming\nhad preceded me. A front room was lighted; my host was waiting.\n\nHugo set down my bag, accepted another gold coin; and with a queer\nsidelong smile, the incentive for which I had not the slightest idea,\nhe vanished. I fronted my host, this Jacob Spawn. Strange fate that\nshould have led me to Spawn! And to little Jetta!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpawn was a fat-bellied Dutchman, as the field attendant had said. A\nfellow of perhaps fifty-five, with sparse gray hair and a heavy-jowled,\nsmooth-shaved face from which his small eyes peered stolidly at me. He\nlaid aside a huge, old-fashioned calabash pipe and offered a pudgy hand.\n\n\"Welcome, young man, to Nareda. Seldom do we see strangers.\"\n\nThe meal which he presently cooked and served me himself was lavishly\ndone. He spoke good English, but slowly, heavily, with the guttural\nintonation of his race. He sat across the table from me, puffing his\npipe while I ate.\n\n\"What brings you here, young lad? A week, you say?\"\n\n\"Or more. I don't know. I'm looking for oil. There should be petroleum\nbeneath these rocks.\"\n\nFor an hour I avoided his prying questions. His little eyes roved me,\nand I knew he was no fool, this Dutchman, for all his heavy, stolid\nlook.\n\nWe remained in his kitchen. Save for its mud walls, its concave,\ndome-roof, it might have been a cookery of the Highlands. There was a\ntable with its tube-light; the chairs; his electron stove; his orderly\nrows of pots and pans and dishes on a broad shelf.\n\nI recall that it seemed to me a woman's hand must be here. But I saw no\nwoman. No one, indeed, beside Spawn himself seemed to live here. He was\nreticent of his own business, however much he wanted to pry into mine.\n\nI had felt convinced that we were alone. But suddenly I realized it was\nnot so. The kitchen adjoined an interior back-garden. I could see it\nthrough the opened door oval--a dim space of flowers; a little path to a\npergola; an adobe fountain. It was a sort of Spanish patio out there,\npartially enclosed by the wings of the house. Moonlight was struggling\ninto it. And, as I gazed idly, I thought I saw a figure lurking. Someone\nwatching us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWas it a boy, observing us from the shadowed moonlit garden? I thought\nso. A slight, half grown boy. I saw his figure--in short ragged trousers\nand a shirt-blouse--made visible in a patch of moonlight as he moved\naway and entered the dark opposite wing of the house.\n\nI did not see the boy's figure again; and presently I suggested that I\nretire. Spawn had already shown me my bedroom. It was in another wing of\nthe house. It had a window facing the front; and a window and door back\nto this same patio. And a door to the house corridor.\n\n\"Sleep well, Meester Grant.\" My bag was here on the table under an\nelectrolier. \"Shall I call you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"Early.\"\n\nHe lingered a moment. I was opening my bag. I flung it wide under his\ngaze.\n\n\"Well, good night. I shall be very comfortable, thanks.\"\n\n\"Good night,\" he said.\n\nHe went out the patio door. I watched his figure cross the moonlit path\nand enter the kitchen. The noise of his puttering there sounded for a\ntime. Then the light went out and the house and garden fell into\nsilence.\n\nI closed my doors. They sealed on the inside, and I fastened them\nsecurely. Then I fastened the transparent window panes. I did not\nundress, but lay on the bed in the dark. I was tired; I realized it now.\nBut sleep would not come.\n\nI am no believer in occultism, but there are premonitions which one\ncannot deny. It seemed now as I lay there in the dark that I had every\nreason to be perturbed, yet I could not think why. Perhaps it was\nbecause I had been lying to this innkeeper stoutly for an hour past, and\nwhether he believed me or not for the life of me I could not now\ndetermine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI sat up on the bed, presently, and adjusted the wires and diaphragms of\nthe ether-wave mechanism. When in place it was all concealed under my\nshirt. As I switched it on, the electrodes against my flesh tingled a\nlittle. But it was absolutely soundless, and one gets used to the\ntingle. I decided to call Hanley.\n\nThe New York wave-sorter handled me promptly, but Hanley's office was\ndead.\n\nAs I sat there in the darkness, annoyed at this, a slight noise forced\nitself on me. A scratching--a tap--something outside my window.\n\nSpawn, come back to peer in at me?\n\nI slipped noiselessly from the bed. The sound had come from the window\nwhich faced the patio. The room, over by the bed, was wholly dark. The\nmoonlight outside showed the patio window as a dimly illumined oval.\n\nFor a moment I crouched on the floor by the bed. No sound. The silence\nof the Lowlands is as heavy and oppressive as its air. I felt as though\nmy heart were audible.\n\nI lifted my foot; extracted my dirk. It opened into a very businesslike\nsteel blade of a good twelve-inch length. I bared the blade. The click\nof it leaving the flat, hollow handle sounded loud in the stillness of\nthe room.\n\nA moment. Then it seemed that outside my window a shadow had moved. I\ncrept along the floor. Rose up suddenly at the window.\n\nAnd stared at a face peering in at me. A small face, framed by short,\nclustering, dark curls.\n\nA girl!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_In a Moonlit Garden_\n\n\nShe drew back from the window like a startled fawn; timorous, yet\ncurious, too, for she ran only a few steps, then turned and stood\npeering. The moonlight slanted over the western roof of the building and\nfell on her. A slight, boyish figure in short, tattered trousers and a\nboy's shirt, open at her slim, rounded throat. The moonlight gleamed on\nthe white shirt fabric to show it torn and ragged. Her arms were\nupraised; her head, with clustering, flying dark curls, was tilted as\nthough listening for a sound from me. A shy, wild creature. Drawn to my\nwindow; tapping to awaken me, then frightened at what she had done.\n\nI opened the garden door. She did not move. I thought she would run, but\nshe did not. The moonlight was on me as I stood there. I was conscious\nof its etching me with its silver sheen. And twenty feet from me this\ngirl stood and gazed, with startled eyes and parted lips--and white\nlimbs trembling like a frightened animal.\n\nThe patio was very silent. The heavy arching fronds stirred slightly\nwith a vague night breeze; the moonlight threw a lacy dark pattern of\nthem on the gray stone path. The fountain bowl gleamed white in the\nmoonlight behind the girl, and in the silence I could hear the low\nsplashing of the water.\n\nA magic moment. Unforgettable. It comes to some of us just once, but to\nall of us it comes. I stood with its spell upon me. Then I heard my\nvoice, tense but softly raised.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nIt frightened her. She retreated until the fountain was between us. And\nas I took a step forward, she retreated further, noiseless, with her\nbare feet treading the smooth stones the path.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI ran and caught her at the doorway of the flowered pergola. She stood\ntrembling as I seized her arms. But the timorous smile remained, and her\neyes, upraised to mine, glowed with misty starlight.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nThis time she answered me. \"I am called Jetta.\"\n\nIt seemed that from her white forearm within my grasp a magic current\nswept from her to me and back again. We humans, for all our clamoring,\nboasting intellectuality, are no more than puppets in Nature's hands.\n\n\"Are you Spawn's daughter?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I saw you a while ago, when I was having my meal.\"\n\n\"Yes--I was watching you.\"\n\n\"I thought you were a boy.\"\n\n\"Yes. My father told me to keep away. I wanted to meet you, so I came to\nwake you up.\"\n\n\"He may be watching us now.\"\n\n\"No. He is sleeping. Listen--you can hear him snore.\"\n\nI could, indeed. The silence of the garden was broken now by a distant,\nchoking snore.\n\nWe both laughed. She sat on the little mossy seat in the pergola doorway\nAnd on the side away from the snore. (I had the wit to be sure of that.)\n\n\"I wanted to meet you,\" she repeated. \"Was it too bold?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI think that what we said sitting there with the slanting moonlight on\nus, could not have amounted to much. Yet for us, it was so important!\nVital. Building memories which I knew--and I think that she knew, even\nthen--we would never forget.\n\n\"I will be here a week, Jetta.\"\n\n\"I want--I want very much to know you. I want you to tell me about the\nworld of the Highlands. I have a few books. I can't read very well, but\nI can look at the pictures.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see--\"\n\n\"A traveler gave them to me. I've got them hidden. But he was an old\nman: all men seem to be old--except those in the pictures, and you,\nPhilip.\"\n\nI laughed. \"Well, that's too bad. I'm mighty glad I'm young.\"\n\nAh, in that moment, with blessed youth surging in my veins, I was glad\nindeed!\n\n\"Young. I don't remember ever seeing anyone like you. The man I am to\nmarry is not like you. He is old, like father--\"\n\nI drew back from her, startled.\n\n\"Marry?\"\n\n\"Yes. When I am seventeen. The law of Nareda--your Highland law, too,\nfather says--will not let a girl be married until she is that age. In a\nmonth I am seventeen.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" And I stammered, \"But why are you going to marry?\"\n\n\"Because father tells me to. And then I shall have fine clothes: it is\npromised me. And go to live in the Highlands, perhaps. And see things;\nand be a woman, not a ragged boy forbidden to show myself; and--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was barely touching her. It seemed as though something--some vision of\nhappiness which had been given me--were fading, were being snatched\naway. I was conscious of my hand moving to touch hers.\n\n\"Why do you marry--unless you're in love? Are you?\"\n\nHer gaze like a child came up to meet mine. \"I never thought much about\nthat. I have tried not to. It frightened me--until to-night.\"\n\nShe pushed me gently away. \"Don't. Let's not talk of him. I'd rather\nnot.\"\n\n\"But why are you dressed as a boy?\"\n\nI gazed at her slim but rounded figure in tattered boy's garb--but the\nwoman's lines were unmistakable. And her face, with clustering curls.\nGentle girlhood. A face of dark, wild beauty.\n\n\"My father hates women. He says they are all bad. It is a sin to wear\nwoman's finery; or it breeds sin in women. Let's not talk of that.\nPhilip, tell me--oh, if you could only realize all the things I want to\nknow. In Great New York, there are theatres and music?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. And began telling her about them.\n\nThe witching of this moonlit garden! But the moon had presently sunk,\nand to the east the stars were fading.\n\n\"Philip! Look! Why, it's dawn already. I've got to leave you.\"\n\nI held her just a moment by the hand.\n\n\"May I meet you here to-morrow night?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said simply.\n\n\"Good night--Jetta.\"\n\n\"Good night. You--you've made me very happy.\"\n\nShe was gone, into a doorway of the opposite wing. The silent, empty\ngarden sounded with the distant, reassuring snores of the still sleeping\nSpawn.\n\nI went back to my room and lay on my bed. And drifted off on a sea of\nmagic memories. The world--my world before this night--now seemed to\nhave been so drab. Empty. Lifeless. But now there was pulsing, living\nmagic in it for me.\n\nI drifted into sleep, thinking of it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_The Mine in the Cauldron Depths_\n\n\nI was awakened by the tinkling, buzzing call of the radio-diaphragm\nbeneath my shirt. I had left the call open.\n\nIt was Hanley. I lay down, eyeing my window which now was illumined by\nthe flat light of dawn.\n\nHanley's microscopic voice:\n\n\"Phil? I've just raised President Markes, there in Nareda. I've been a\nbit worried about you.\"\n\n\"I'm all right, Chief.\"\n\n\"Well, you'd better see President Markes this morning.\"\n\n\"That was my intention.\"\n\n\"Tell him frankly what you're after. This smuggling of quicksilver from\nNareda has got to stop. But take it easy, Phil; don't be reckless.\nRemember: one little knife thrust and I've lost a good man!\"\n\nI laughed at his anxious tone. That was always Hanley's way. A devil\nhimself, when he was on a trail, but always worried for fear one of his\nmen would come to harm.\n\n\"Right enough, Chief. I'll be careful.\"\n\nHe cut off presently.\n\nI did not see Jetta that morning. I told Spawn I was hoping to see\nPresident Markes on my petroleum proposition. And at the proper hour I\ntook myself to the government house.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis Lowland village by daylight seemed even more fantastic than\nshrouded in the shadows of night. The morning sun had dissipated the\noverhead mists. It was hot in the rocky streets under the weird\noverhanging vegetation. The settlement was quietly busy with its\ntropical activities. There were a few local shops; vehicles with the\nHighland domestic animals--horses and oxen--panting in the heat; an\noccasional electro-automatic car.\n\nBut there were not many evidences of modernity here. The street and\nhouse tube-lights. A few radio image-finders on the house-tops. An\nautomatic escalator bringing ore from a nearby mine past the government\ncheckers to an aero stage for northern transportation. Cultivated fields\nin the village outskirts operated with modern machinery.\n\nBut beyond that, it seemed primitive. Two hundred years back. Street\nvendors. People in primitive, ragged, tropical garb. Half naked\nchildren. I was stared at curiously. An augmenting group of children\nfollowed me as I went down the street.\n\nThe President admitted me at once. In his airy office, with safeguards\nagainst eavesdropping, I found him at his desk with a bank of modern\ninstruments before him.\n\n\"Sit down, Grant.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was a heavy-set, flabby man of sixty-odd, this Lowland President.\nWhite hair; and an old-fashioned, rolling white mustache of the sort\nlately come into South American fashion. He sat with a glass of iced\ndrink at his side. His uniform was stiffly white, and ornate with heavy\ngold braid, but his neckpiece was wilted with perspiration.\n\n\"Damnable heat, Grant.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir President.\"\n\n\"Have a drink.\" He swung a tinkling glass before me. \"Now then, tell me\nwhat is your trouble. Smuggling, here in Nareda. I don't believe it.\"\nHis eyes, incongruously alert with all the rest of him so fat and lazy,\ntwinkled at me. \"We of the Nareda Government watch our quicksilver\nproduction very closely. The government fee is a third.\"\n\nI might say that the Nareda government collected a third on all the\nmineral and agricultural products of the country, in exchange for the\nnecessary government concessions. Markes exported this share openly to\nthe world markets, paying the duty exactly like a private corporation.\n\nHe added, \"You think--Hanley thinks--the smuggling is on too large a\nscale to be any illicit producer?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Then,\" he said, \"it must be one of our recognized mines.\"\n\n\"Hanley thinks it is a recognized mine, falsifying its production\nrecord,\" I explained.\n\n\"If that is so, I will discover it,\" he said. He spoke with enthusiasm\nand vigor. \"For you I shall treat as what you are--the representative\nof our most friendly government. The figures of our quicksilver\nproduction I shall lay before you in just a few days. Let me fill up\nyour glass, Grant.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lazy tropics. I really did not doubt his sincerity. But I did doubt\nhis ability to cope with any clever criminal. His enthusiasm for action\nwould wilt like his neckpiece, in Nareda's heat. Unless, perhaps, the\nknowledge that the smuggler was cheating him as well as the United\nStates--_that_ might spur him.\n\nHe added--and now I got a shock wholly unexpected: \"If we think that\nsome recognized producer of quicksilver here is cheating us, it should\nnot be difficult to check up on it. Nareda has only one large cinnabar\nlode being worked. A private individual: that fellow Jacob Spawn--\"\n\n\"Spawn?\" I exclaimed involuntarily.\n\n\"Why, yes. Did not he mention it? His mine is no more than ten\nkilometers from here--back on the southern slope.\"\n\n\"He didn't mention it,\" I said.\n\n\"So? That is strange; but he is a secretive Dutchman by nature. He\nspecializes in prying into the other fellow's affairs. Hm-m.\"\n\nHe fell into a reverie while I stared at him. Spawn, the big--the only\nbig--quicksilver producer here!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe President interrupted my startled thoughts. \"I hope you did not\nintimate your real purpose?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nWe both turned at the sound of an opening door. Markes called, \"Ah, come\nin Perona! Are you alone? Good! Close that slide. Here is Chief Hanley's\nrepresentative.\" He introduced us all in a breath. \"This is interesting,\nPerona. Damnably interesting. We're being cheated, what? It looks that\nway. Sit down, Perona.\"\n\nThis was Greko Perona. Nareda's Minister of Internal Affairs. Spawn had\nmentioned him to me. A South American. A man in his fifties. Thin and\ndarkly saturnine, with iron-gray hair, carefully plastered to cover his\nhalf-bald head. He sat listening to the President's harangue, twirling\nthe upturned waxen ends of his artificially black mustache. A wave of\nperfume enveloped him. A ladies' courtier, this Perona by the look of\nhim. His white uniform was immaculate, carefully tailored and carefully\nworn to set off at its best his still trim and erect figure.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, when at last the President paused, \"of a surety\nsomething must be done.\"\n\nPerona seemed not excited, rather more carefully watchful, of his own\nwords, and of me. His small dark eyes roved me.\n\n\"What is it you would plan to do about it, Se\u00f1orito?\"\n\nAn irony was in that Latin diminutive! He spread his pale hands. \"Your\nUnited States officials perhaps exaggerate. I am very doubtful if we\nhave smugglers here in Nareda.\"\n\n\"Unless it is Spawn,\" the President interjected.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPerona frowned slightly. But his suave manner remained. \"Spawn? Why\nSpawn?\"\n\n\"You need not take offense, Perona,\" Markes retorted. \"We are discussing\nthis before an envoy of the United States, sent here to consult with us.\nWe have nothing to hide.\"\n\nMarkes turned to me. And his next words were like a bomb exploding at my\nfeet.\n\n\"Perona _is_ offended, Grant. But I promise you, his natural personal\nprejudice will not affect my investigation. Of course he is prejudiced,\nsince he is to marry Spawn's daughter, the little Jetta.\"\n\nI started involuntarily. This pomaded old dotard! This perfumed, ancient\ndandy!\n\nFor all the importance of my mission in Nareda my thoughts had been\nsubconsciously more upon Jetta--far more--than upon smugglers of\nquicksilver. This palsied popinjay! This, the reality of the specter\nwhich had been between Jetta and me during all that magic time in the\nmoonlit garden!\n\nThis suave old rake! Betrothed to that woodland pixie whose hand I had\nheld and to whom I had sung love songs in the magic flower-scented\nmoonlight only a few hours ago! And whom I had promised to meet there\nagain to-night!\n\nThis, then, was my rival!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNothing of importance transpired during the remainder of that interview.\nMarkes reiterated his intention of making a complete governmental\ninvestigation at once. To which Perona suavely assented.\n\n\"_Por Dios Se\u00f1orito_,\" he said to me, \"we would not have your great\ngovernment annoyed at Nareda. If there are smugglers, we will capture\nthem of a certainty.\"\n\nFrom the Government House, it now being almost time for the midday meal,\nI returned to Spawn's.\n\nThe rambling mud walls of the Inn stood baking in the noonday heat when\nI arrived. The outer garden drowsed; there seemed no one about. I went\nthrough the main door oval into the front public room, where first I had\nmet Spawn. He was not here now, nor was Jetta.\n\nA sudden furtiveness fell upon me. With noiseless steps I went the\nlength of the dim, padded interior corridor to my own room. My\nbelongings seemed undisturbed; a vague idea that Spawn might have seized\nthis opportunity to ransack them had come to me. But it seemed not;\nthough if he had he would have found nothing.\n\nI stood for a moment listening at my patio window. I could see the\nkitchen from here; there was no one in it. I started back for the living\nroom. That furtive instinct was still on me. I made no noise. And\nabruptly I heard Spawn's voice, floating out softly in the hushed\nsilence of the house.\n\n\"So, Perona?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA brief silence, in which it seemed that I could hear a tiny aerial\nanswer. Then Spawn again. A startled oath.\n\n\"De duvel! You say--\"\n\nI stood frozen, listening.\n\n\"She is here.... Yes, I will keep her close. I am no fool, Perona.\"\n\nSpawn's laugh was like a growl. \"Later to-day, yes. Fear not! I am no\nfool. I will be careful of it.\"\n\nSpawn, talking by private audiphone, to Perona. The colloquy came to an\nabrupt end.\n\n\"... Might eavesdrop? By hell, you are right!\"\n\nI heard the click as Spawn and Perona broke connection. Spawn came from\nhis room. But he was not quick enough. I slipped away before he saw me.\nIn the living room I had time to be calmly seated with a lighted\ncigarette. His approaching heavy footsteps sounded. He came in.\n\n\"Oh--Grant.\"\n\n\"Good noon, friend Spawn. I'm hungry.\" I grinned at him. \"I understand\nmy bargain with you included a noonday meal. Does it?\"\n\nHe eyed me suspiciously. \"Have you been waiting here long?\"\n\n\"No. I just came in.\"\n\nHe led me to the kitchen. He apologized for the informality of his hotel\nservice: visitors were so infrequent. But the good quality of his food\nwould make up for it.\n\n\"Right,\" I agreed. \"Your food is marvelous, friend Spawn.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a difference in Spawn's manner toward me now. He seemed far\nmore wary. Outwardly he was in a high good humor. He asked nothing\nconcerning my morning at the Government House. He puttered over his\nelectron-stove, making me help him; he cursed the heat; he said one\ncould not eat in such heat as this; but the meal he cooked, and the way\nhe sat down opposite me and attacked it, belied him.\n\nHe was acting; but so was I. And perhaps I deceived him as little as he\ndeceived me. We avoided the things which were uppermost in the thoughts\nof us both. But, when we had very nearly finished the meal, I decided to\ntry him out. I said suddenly, out of a silence:\n\n\"Spawn, why didn't you tell me you were a producer of quicksilver?\" I\nshot him a sharp glance. \"You are, aren't you?\"\n\nIt took him by surprise, but he recovered himself instantly. \"Yes. Are\nyou interested?\"\n\nI tried another shot. \"What surprised me was that a wealthy mine\nowner--you are, aren't you?--should bother to keep an unprofitable\nhotel. Why bother with it, Spawn?\"\n\nI thought I knew the answer: he wanted Nareda's visitors under his eyes.\n\n\"That is a pleasure.\" There was irony in his tone. \"I am a lonesome man.\nI like--interesting companionship, such as yours, young Grant.\"\n\nIt was on my tongue to hint at his daughter. But I thought better of it.\n\n\"I am going to the mine now,\" he said abruptly. \"Would you like to\ncome?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I smiled. \"Thanks.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI wanted to see his mine. But that he should be eager to show it,\nsurprised me. I wondered what purpose he could have in that. I had a\nhint of it later; for when we took his little autocar and slid up the\nwinding road into the bloated crags towering on the slope behind Nareda,\nhe told me calmly:\n\n\"I shall have to put you in charge of my mine commander. I am busy\nelsewhere this afternoon. You will see the mine just as well without\nme.\"\n\nHe added. \"I must go to the Government House: President Markes wants a\nreport on my recent production.\"\n\nSo that was what Perona had told him over the audiphone just before our\nnoonday meal?\n\nIt was an inferno of shadows and glaring lights, this underground\ncavern. As modern mining activities go, it was small and primitive. No\nmore than a dozen men were here, beside the sweating pudgy mine\ncommander who was my guide. A voluble fellow; of what original\nnationality I could not determine.\n\nWe stood watching the line of carts dumping the ore onto the endless\nlifting-belt. It went a hundred feet or so up and out of the cavern's\nascending shaft, to fall with a clatter into the bins above the smelter.\n\n\"Rich ore,\" I said. \"Isn't it?\"\n\nThe cinnabar ran like thick blood-red veins in the rock.\n\n\"Rich,\" said the mine commander. \"That it is. Rich. But who does it make\nrich? Only Spawn, not me.\" He waved his arms, airing his grievance with\nwhich for an hour past he had regaled me. \"Only Spawn. For me, a dole\neach week.\"\n\nThe smelter was in a stone building--one of a small group of mine houses\nwhich stood in a cauldron depression above excavations. Rounded domes of\nrock towered above them. The sun, even at this tri-noon hour, was gone\nbehind the heights above us. The murky shadows of night were gathering,\nthe mists of the Lowlands settling. The tube-lights of the mine, strung\nbetween small metal poles, winked on like bleary eyes.\n\n\"Of a day soon I will fling this job to hell--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was paying scant attention to the fellow's tirade. Could there be\nsmuggling going on from this mine? It all seemed to be conducted openly\nenough. If the production record were being falsified I felt that this\ndissatisfied mine commander was not aware of it. He showed me the\nsmelter, where the quicksilver condensed in the coils and ran with its\nsmall luminous silver streams into the vats.\n\nHe was called away momentarily by one of his men, leaving me standing\nthere. I was alone; no one seemed in sight, or within hearing. In the\nshadow of the condensers I drew out my transmitter and called Hanley.\n\nI got him within a minute.\n\n\"Chief!\"\n\n\"Yes, Phil. I hoped you'd call me. Didn't want to chance it, raising you\nwhen you might not be alone.\"\n\nI told him swiftly what I had done; where I was now.\n\nAnd Hanley said, with equal briskness: \"I've an important fact. Just had\nMarkes on secret wave-length. He tells me that Spawn has been saving up\nhis quicksilver for six months past. He's got several hundred thousand\ndollar-standards' worth of it in ingots there right now.\"\n\n\"Here at the mine?\"\n\n\"Yes. Got them all radiuminized, ready for the highest priced markets.\nMarkes says he is scheduled to turn them over to the government checkers\nto-morrow. The Nareda government takes its share to-morrow; then Spawn\nexports the rest.\"\n\nI heard a footstep. \"Off, Chief! I'll call you later!\"\n\nI clicked off summarily. The little grid was under my shirt when the\nmine commander rejoined me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor another half hour or to I hovered about the smelter house. A\ntreasure of quicksilver ingots here? I mentioned it casually to my\ncompanion. He shot me a sharp glance.\n\n\"Spawn has told you that?\"\n\n\"I heard it.\"\n\n\"His business. We do not talk of that. Never can I tell what Spawn will\nchoose to take offense at.\"\n\nWe rambled upon other subjects. Later, he said, \"We work not at night.\nBut Spawn, he is here often at night, with his friend, the Se\u00f1or\nPerona.\"\n\nThat caught my attention. \"I met Perona this morning,\" I said quickly.\n\"Is he a partner of Spawn's?\"\n\n\"If he is so, I never was told it. But much he is here--at night.\"\n\n\"Why at night?\"\n\nThe fellow really knew nothing. Or if he did, he was diplomatic enough\nnot to jeopardize his post by babbling of it to me. He said:\n\n\"Perona is Spawn's friend. Why not? His daughter to marry: that will\nmake him a son-in-law.\" He laughed. \"An old fool, but not such a fool\neither. Spawn is rich.\"\n\n\"His daughter. Has he a daughter?\"\n\n\"The little Jetta. You haven't seen her? Well, that is not strange.\nSpawn keeps her very hidden. A mystery about it: all Nareda talks, but\nno one knows; and Spawn does not like questions.\"\n\nSpawn abruptly joined us! He came from the black shadows of the lurid\nsmelter room. Had he heard us discussing Jetta? I wondered.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_Mysterious Meeting_\n\n\n\"Ah, Grant--have you enjoyed yourself?\" He dismissed his subordinate. \"I\nwas detained. Sorry.\"\n\nHe was smoothly imperturbable. \"Have you seen everything? Quite a little\nplant I have here? We shut down early to-day. I will make ready to\nclose.\"\n\nI followed him about while he arranged for the termination of the day's\nactivities. The clatter of the smelter house was presently still; the\nmen departing. Spawn and I were the last to leave, save for the eight\nmen who were the mine's night guards. They were stalwart, silent\nfellows, armed with electronic needle projectors.\n\nThe lights of the mine went low until they were mere pencil points of\nblue illumination in the gloom. The eery look of the place was\nintensified by the darkness and silence of the abnormally early\nnightfall. The fantastic crags stood dark with formless shadow.\n\nSpawn stopped to speak to one of the guards. The men wore a\ngold-trimmed, but now dirty, white linen uniform, wilted by the\nheat--the uniform of Nareda's police. I remarked it to him.\n\n\"The government lent me the men,\" Spawn explained. \"Of an ordinary time\nI have only one guard.\"\n\n\"But this then, is not an ordinary time?\" I hinted.\n\nHe looked at me sharply. And upon sudden impulse, I added:\n\n\"President Markes said something about you having a treasure here.\nRadiumized quicksilver.\"\n\nIt was evidently Spawn's desire to appear thoroughly frank with me. He\nlaughed. \"Well, then, if Markes has told you, then might I not as well\nadmit it? The treasure is here, indeed yes. Will you like to see it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe led me into a little strong room adjoining the smelter\ncoil-rectifiers. He flashed his hand searchlight. On the floor, piled\ncrosswise, were small moulded bars of refined quicksilver--dull,\ndarkened silver ingots of this world's most precious metal.\n\n\"Quite a treasure, Grant, here to-night. See, it is radiumized.\"\n\nHe snapped off his torch. In the darkness the little bars glowed\nirridescent.\n\n\"To-morrow I will divide with our Nareda government. One-third for them.\nAnd my own share I will export: to Great New York, this shipment.\nAlready I have the order for it.\"\n\nHe added calmly, \"The duty is high, Grant. Too bad your big New York\nmarket is protected by so large a duty. With my cost of\nproduction--these accursed Lowland workmen who demand so much for their\nlabor, and a third of all I produce taken by Nareda--there is not much\nin it for me.\"\n\nHe had re-lighted the room. I could feel his eyes on me, but I said\nnothing. It was obvious to me now that he knew I was a government\ncustoms agent.\n\nI said, \"This certainly interests me, friend Spawn. I'll tell you why\nsome other time.\"\n\nWe exchanged significant glances, both of us smiling.\n\n\"Well can I guess it, young Grant. So here is my treasure. Without the\nduty I would soon be wealthy. Chut! Why should I roll in a pity for\nmyself? There is a duty and I am an honest man, so I pay it.\"\n\nI said, \"Aren't you afraid to leave this stored here?\" I knew that this\npile of ingots--the quicksilver in its radiumized form--was worth four\nor five hundred thousand dollars in American gold-coin at the very\nleast.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpawn shrugged. \"Who would attack it? But of course I will be glad to be\nrid of it. It is a great responsibility--even though it carries\ninternational insurance, to protect my and the Nareda Government share.\"\n\nHe was sealing up the heavy barred portals of the little strong-room.\nThere was an alarm-detector, connected with the office of Nareda's\npolice commander. Spawn set the alarm carefully.\n\n\"I have every safeguard, Grant. There is really no danger.\" He added, as\nthough with sudden thought. \"Except possibly one--a depth bandit named\nDe Boer. Ever you have heard of him?\"\n\n\"Yes. I have.\"\n\nWe climbed into Spawn's small automatic vehicle. The lights of the mine\nfaded behind us as we coasted the winding road down to the village.\n\n\"De Boer,\" said Spawn. \"A fellow who lives by his wits in the depths.\nNear here, perhaps: who knows? They say he has many followers--fifty--a\nhundred, perhaps--outlaws: a cut-belly band it must be.\"\n\n\"Didn't he once take a hand in Nareda's politics?\" I suggested.\n\nSpawn guffawed. \"That is so. He was once what they called a patriot\nhere. He thought he might be made President. But Markes ran him out. Now\nhe is a bandit. I have believe that American mail-ship which sank last\nyear in the cauldron north of the Nares Sea--you remember how it was\nattacked by bandits?--I have always believe that was De Boer's band.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe rolled back to Nareda. Spawn's manner had again changed. He seemed\neven more friendly than before. More at his ease with me. We had supper,\nand smoked together in his living room for half an hour afterward. But\nmy thoughts were more on Jetta than on her father. There was still no\nevidence of her about the premises. Ah, if I only had known what had\ntaken place there at Spawn's that afternoon while I was at the mine!\n\nSoon after supper Spawn yawned. \"I think I shall go to bed.\" His glance\nwas inquiring. \"What are you going to do?\"\n\nI stood up. \"I'll go to bed, too. Markes wants to see me early in the\nmorning. You'll be there, Spawn?\"\n\n\"Yes. We will go together.\"\n\nIt was still no more than eight o'clock in the evening. Spawn followed\nme to my bedroom, and left me at its door.\n\n\"Sleep well. I will call you in time.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Spawn.\"\n\nI wondered if there were irony in his voice as he said good night. No\none could have told.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI did not go to bed. I sat listening to the silence of my room and the\ngarden, and Spawn's retreating footsteps. He had said he was sleepy, but\nnevertheless I presently heard him across the patio. He was apparently\nin the kitchen, cleaning away our meal, to judge by the rattling of his\npans. It was as yet not much after hour eight of the evening. The hours\nbefore my tryst with Jetta seemed an interminable time to wait. She\nmight not come, though, I was afraid, until midnight.\n\nAt all events I felt that I had some hours yet. And it occurred to me\nthat the evening was not yet too far advanced for me to call upon\nPerona. He lived not far from here, I had learned. I wanted to see this\nberibboned old Minister of Nareda's Internal Affairs.\n\nI would use as my excuse a desire to discuss further the possibility of\nsmuggler being here in Nareda.\n\nI put on my hat and a light jacket, verified that my dirk was readily\naccessible and sealed up my room. Spawn apparently was still in the\nkitchen. I got out of the house, I felt sure, without him being aware of\nit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Nareda streets were quiet. There was a few pedestrians, and none of\nthem paid much attention to me. It was no more than ten minutes walk to\nPerona's home.\n\nHis house was set back from the road, surrounded by luxurious\nvegetation. There was a gate in front of the garden, and another, a\nhundred feet or to along a small alleyway which bordered the ground to\nmy left. I was about to enter the front gate when sight of a figure\npassing under the garden foliage checked me. It was a man, evidently\ncoming from the house and headed toward the side gate. He went through a\nshaft of light that slanted from one of the lower windows of the house.\n\nPerona! I was sure it was he. His slight figure, with a gay,\ntri-cornered hat. A short tasseled cloak hanging from his shoulders. He\nwas alone; walking fast. He evidently had not seen me. I crouched\noutside the high front wall, and through its lattice bars I saw him\nreach the side gate, open it swiftly, pass through, and close it after\nhim. There was something furtive about his manner, for all he was\nundisguised. I decided to follow him.\n\nThe front street fortunately was deserted at the moment. I waited long\nenough for him to appear. But he did not; and when I ran to the alley\ncorner--chancing bumping squarely into him--I saw him far down its dim,\nnarrow length where it opened into the back street which bordered his\ngrounds to the rear. He turned to the left and shot a swift glance up\nthe alley, which I anticipated, provided for by drawing back. When I\nlooked again, he was gone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have had some experience at playing the shadow. But it was not easy\nhere along the almost deserted and fairly bright Nareda streets. Perona\nwas walking swiftly down the slope toward the outskirts of the village\nwhere it bordered upon the Nares Sea. For a time I thought he was headed\nfor the landing field, but at a cross-path he turned sharply to the\nright, away from the field, whose sheen of lights I could now see down\nthe rocky defile ahead of me. There was nothing but broken, precipitous\nrocky country ahead of him, into which this path he had taken was\nwinding. What could Perona, a Minister, be engaged in, wandering off\nalone into this black, deserted region?\n\nIt was black indeed, by now. The village was soon far behind us. A storm\nwas in the night air; a wind off the sea; solid black clouds overhead\nblotted out the moon and stars. The crags and buttes and gullies of this\ntumbled area loomed barely visible about me. There were times when only\nmy feel of the path under my feet kept me from straying, to fall into a\nravine or crevice.\n\nI prowled perhaps two hundred yards behind Perona. He was using a tiny\nhand-flash now; it bobbed and winked in the darkness ahead, vanishing\nsometimes when a curve in the path hid him, or when he plunged down into\na gully and up again. I had no search-beam. Nor would I have dared use\none: Perona could too obviously have seen that someone was following\nhim.\n\nThere was half a mile of this, I think, though it seemed interminable. I\ncould hear the sea, rising with the wind, pounding against the rocks to\nmy left. Then, a distance ahead, I saw lights moving. Perona's--and\nothers. Three or four of them. Their combined glow made a radiance which\nillumined the path and rocks. I could see the figures of several men\nwhom Perona had joined. They stood a moment and then moved off. To the\nright a ragged cliff wall towered the path. The spots of light bobbed\ntoward it. I caught the vague outline of a huge broken opening, like a\ncave mouth in the cliff. The lights were swallowed by it.\n\nI crept cautiously forward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_Ether-wave Eavesdropping_\n\n\nI had thought it was a cavern mouth into which the men had disappeared,\nbut it was not. I reached it without any encounter. It loomed above me,\na great archway in the cliff--an opening fifty feet high and equally as\nbroad. And behind it was a roofless cave--a sort of irregularly circular\nbowl, five hundred feet across its broken, bowlder-strewn, caked-ooze\nfloor.\n\nI crouched in the blackness under the archway. The moon had risen and\nits light filtered with occasional shafts through the swift-flying black\nclouds overhead. The scene was brighter. It was dark in the archway, but\na glow of moonlight in the bowl beyond showed me its tumbled floor and\nthe precipitous, eroded walls, like a crater-rim, which encircled it.\n\nThe men whom Perona had met were across the bowl near its opposite side.\nI could see the group of them, five hundred feet from me, by a little\nmoonlight that was on them; also by the sheen from the spots of their\nhand-lights. Four or five men, and Perona. I thought I distinguished the\naged Minister sitting on a rock, and before him a huge giant man's\nfigure striding up and down. Perona seemed talking vehemently: the men\nwere listening; the giant paused occasionally in his pacing to fling a\nquestion.\n\nAll this I saw with my first swift glance. My attention was drawn from\nthe men to an object near them. The nose of a flyer showed between two\nupstanding crags on the floor of the valley. Only its forward horizontal\npropellers and the tip of its cabin and landing gear were visible, but I\ncould guess that it was a fair-sized ship.\n\nThe men were too far away for me to hear them. Could I get across the\nfloor of the bowl without discovery? It did not seem so. The accursed\nmoonlight became stronger every moment. Then I saw a guard--a dark\nfigure of a man showing just inside the archway, some seventy feet from\nme. He was leaning against a rock, facing my way. In his hands was a\nthick-barreled electronic projector.\n\nI could not advance: that was obvious. The moonlight lay in a clear\nclean patch beyond the archway. The guard stood at its edge.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA minute or two had passed. Perona was still talking vehemently. I was\nlosing it: not a word was audible. Yet I felt that if I could hear\nPerona now, much that Hanley and I wanted to learn would be made clear\nto us. My little microphone receiver could be adjusted for audible air\nvibrations. I crouched and held it cautiously above my head with its\nface, like a listening ear, turned toward the distant men. My\nsingle-vacuum amplification brought up the sound until their voices\nsounded like whispers murmured in my ear-grids.\n\n\"De Boer, listen to me--\"\n\nPerona's voice. They must have been chance words spoken loudly. It was\nall I could hear, save tantalizing, unintelligible murmurs.\n\nSo this was De Boer, the bandit! The big fellow pacing before Perona. I\nwanted infinitely more, now, to hear what was being said.\n\nI thought of Hanley. There might be a way of handling this.\n\nI had to murmur very softly. I was hidden in these shadows from the\nguard's sight, but he was close enough to hear my normal voice. I\nchanced it. A wind was sucking through the archway with an audible\nwhine: the guard might not hear me.\n\n\"X. 2. AY.\"\n\nThe sorter's desk. He came in. I murmured Hanley's rating. \"Rush.\nDanger. Special.\"\n\nIt went swiftly through. Hanley, thank Heaven, was at his desk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI plugged in my little image finder; held it over my head; turned it\nslowly. I whispered:\n\n\"Look around, Chief. See where I am? Near Nareda; couple of miles out.\nFollowed Perona; he met these men.\n\n\"The big one is De Boer, the depth bandit. I can't hear what they're\nsaying--but I can send you their voice murmurs.\"\n\n\"Amplify them all you can. Relay them up,\" Hanley ordered.\n\nI caught Perona's murmurs again; I swung them through my tiny\ntransformers and off my transmitter points into the ether.\n\n\"Hear them, Chief?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'll try further amplification.\"\n\nIt was what I had intended. Hanley's greater power might be able to\namplify those murmurs into audible strength.\n\n\"I'm getting them, Phil.\"\n\nHe swung them back to me. Grotesquely distorted, blurred with tube-hum\nand interference crackle, they roared in my ear-grids so loudly that I\nsaw the nearby guard turn his head as though startled. Listening....\n\nBut evidently he concluded it was nothing.\n\nI cut down the volume. Hanley switched in.\n\n\"By God. Phil! This--\"\n\n\"Off, Chief! Let me hear, too!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe cut away. Those distorted voices! They came from Perona and the\nbandits to me across this five hundred foot moonlit bowl; from me,\nthirteen hundred miles up to Hanley's instruments; and back to me once\nmore. But the words, most of them, now were distinguishable.\n\nPerona's voice: \"I tell it to you. De Boer ... and a good chance for you\nto make the money.\"\n\n\"But will they pay?\"\n\n\"Of course they will pay. Big. A ransom princely.\"\n\n\"And why, Perona? Why princely? Who is this fellow--so important?\"\n\n\"He is with rich business men, I tell to you.\"\n\n\"A private citizen?\"\n\n\"... And a private citizen, of a surety. Fool! Have you come to be a\ncoward, De Boer?\"\n\n\"Pah!\"\n\n\"Well then I tell you it is a lifetime chance. All of it I have\narranged. If he was a government agent, that would be very different,\nfor they are very keen, this administration of the American government,\nto protect their agents. But their private citizens--it is a scandal! Do\nyou not ever pick the newscasters' reports, De Boer? Has it not been a\nscandal that this administration does very little for its citizens\nabroad?\"\n\n\"And you want to get rid of this fellow? Why, Perona?\"\n\n\"That is not your concern. The ransom is to be all yours. Make away with\nhim--in the depths somewhere. Demand your ransom. Fifty thousand\ngold-standards! Demand it of me. Of Nareda!\"\n\n\"And you will pay it?\"\n\n\"I promise it. Nareda will pay it--and Nareda will collect the ransom\nfrom the American capitalists. Very easy.\"\n\nHis voice fell lower. \"Between us, you will get the ransom money from\nNareda--and then kill your prisoner if you like. Call it an accident;\nwhat matter? And dead men are silent men, De Boer. I will see that no\nreal pursuit is made after you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were talking about me! It was obvious. Questions rushed at me.\nPerona, planning with this bandit to abduct me. Hold me for ransom. Or\nkill me! But Perona knew that I was not a private citizen. He was lying\nto De Boer, to persuade him.\n\nWhy this attack upon me? Was Spawn in on it? Why were they so anxious to\nget rid of me? Because of Jetta? Or because I was dangerous, prying\ninto their smuggling activities. Or both?\n\nDe Boer: \"... Get up with my men through the streets to Spawn's house?\nYou have it fixed?\"\n\n\"Yes. Over the route from here as I told you, there are no police\nto-night. I have ordered them off. In the garden. _Dios!_ You offer so\nmany objections! I tell you all is fixed. In an hour, half an hour; even\nnow, perhaps, the Americano is in the garden. The girl has promised to\nmeet him there. He will be there, fear not. Will you go?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Hah! That is the De Boer I have always admired!\"\n\nI could see them in the moonlight across the pit. Perona now standing\nup, the giant figure of the bandit towering over him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHanley's microscopic voice cut in: \"Getting it, Phil? To seize you for\nransom!\"\n\n\"Yes. I hear it.\"\n\n\"This girl. Who--?\"\n\n\"Wait, Chief. Off--\"\n\nDe Boer: \"I will do it! Fifty thousand.\"\n\nPerona: \"An hour now. Spawn will be at his home asleep.\"\n\n\"And you will go to the mine?\"\n\n\"Yes. Now, from here. You seize this fellow Grant, and then attack the\nmine. Our regular plan, De Boer. This does not change it.\"\n\nAttack Spawn's mine! Half a million of treasure was there to-night!\n\nPerona was chuckling: \"You give Spawn's guards the signal. They are all\nmy men--in my pay. They will run away when you appear.\"\n\nHanley cut in again. \"By the gods, they're after that treasure! Phil,\nlisten to me! you must....\" His voice faded.\n\n\"Chief, I can't hear you!\"\n\nHanley came again: \"... And I will notify Porto Rico. The local patrol\nwill be about ready to leave.\"\n\n\"Or notify Nareda headquarters,\" I suggested. \"If you can get President\nMarkes, he can send some police to the mine--\"\n\n\"And find all Nareda's police bribed by Perona? I'll get Porto Rico. We\nhave an hour or two; the patrol can reach you in an hour.\"\n\nThe bandits were preparing to leave here. Two or three of them had gone\nto the flyer. Perona and De Boer were parting.\n\n\"... Well, that is all, De Boer.\"\n\n\"Right, Se\u00f1or Perona. I will start shortly.\"\n\n\"On foot, by the street route to Spawn's--\"\n\nHanley's hurried voice came back: \"I've sent the call to Porto Rico.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe guard had moved again. He was no more than forty feet away from me\nnow--standing up gazing directly toward where I was crouching over my\ntiny instruments in the shadows of the rocky arch. A footstep sounded\nbehind me, on the path outside the arch. Someone approaching!\n\nA tiny light bobbing!\n\nThen a voice calling, \"Perona! De Boer!\"\n\nThe guard took a step forward; stopped, with levelled weapon.\n\nThen the voice again: it was so loud it went through my opened relay,\nflashed up to New York, and blew out half a dozen of Hanley's attuned\nvacuums.\n\n\"Perona!\"\n\nSpawn's voice! He was coming toward me! I lay prone, my little grids\nswitched off. I held my breath.\n\nSpawn's figure went past within ten feet of me. But he did not see me.\n\nHe met the guard. \"Hello, Gutierrez. The damned American--\"\n\nPerona and De Boer came hastening. Spawn joined them in the moonlight\njust beyond the archway, close enough for me to hear them plainly. Spawn\nwas out of breath, panting from his swift walk. He greeted them with a\nroar.\n\n\"The American--he is gone!\"\n\n\"_Dios!_ Gone where, Spawn?\"\n\n\"The hell--how do I know, Perona? He is gone from his room--from the\nhouse. Maybe he followed you here? Did he?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_Behind the Sealed Door_\n\n\nThere was a moment when I think I might have escaped unseen from that\narchway. But I was too amazed at Spawn's appearance to think of my own\nsituation. I had believed that Perona was plotting against Spawn,\nmeeting these bandits in this secret place; I had just heard them\nplanning to attack Spawn's mine--to rob it of the treasure doubtless,\nwhich I knew was stored there.\n\nBut I realized now it was not a plot against Spawn. He had come here\nswiftly to join Perona and tell him that I, their intended victim, was\nmissing. He had greeted the bandit guard by name. He seemed, indeed, as\nwell known to these bandits as Perona himself.\n\nThey stood now in a group some thirty feet away from me. I could hear\ntheir excited voices perfectly clearly. My instruments were off; but I\nrecall that as I listened to Spawn I was also aware of the tingle of the\nelectrode-band on my chest--Hanley, vigorously calling me back to find\nout why I had so summarily disconnected.\n\n\"I took him to his room,\" Spawn was explaining excitedly. \"De duvel, why\nshould I have sealed him in? How could I? He is no child!\"\n\nDe Boer laughed caustically. \"And so he has walked away from you? I\nthink I am a fool to mix myself with you two.\"\n\nPerona retorted, \"I have made you rich, De Boer. Think what you like;\nto-night is the end of our partnership. Only, you do what I have told\nyou to-night.\"\n\n\"Hah! How can I? Your American has flown his trap.\"\n\nThis guard--this Gutierrez, as Spawn had called him--was listening with\ninterest. De Boer's several other men were gathered there. I felt\nmyself safe where I was, for the moment at least.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI cut Hanley in. \"Chief, they're closer! Spawn has come! They've missed\nme! I'll relay what they're saying, but you step it down; there's too\nmuch volume.\"\n\n\"You're all right, Phil? Thank Heaven for that! Something blew my\nvacuums.\"\n\n\"Chief, listen--here they are--\"\n\nPerona: \"But he will be back. In the garden now, no doubt, with Jetta.\"\n\nDe Boer: \"Ah--the little Jetta! So she is there, Spawn? Not in years\nhave you spoken of your daughter. A young lady now, I suppose. Is it\nso?\"\n\nSpawn cursed. \"We leave her out of this. You follow the Se\u00f1or's plan.\"\n\n\"Come to your house? You think the bird will be there for me to seize?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Perona put in. \"You go there; in an hour. Then to the mine.\"\n\nSpawn undoubtedly was in this plot to attack his mine! He said, \"At the\nmine we have arranged everything. Damn this American! But for Perona I\nwould not bother with him.\"\n\n\"But you will bother,\" Perona interjected.\n\nDe Boer laughed again. \"I would be witless could I not figure this! He\nis a young man, and so handsome he has frightened you with the little\nJetta! Is that it, Perona? Jealous, eh?\"\n\nI had been holding the image finder so that Hanley might see them.\nHanley's voice rattled my ear-grid. \"Phil! Get away from there! Look! De\nBoer is searching!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDe Boer had, a moment before, spoken quietly aside to Gutierrez. And now\nthree or four of the men were spreading out, poking about with small\nhand-flashes. Searching for me! The possibility that I might be here,\neavesdropping!\n\nHanley repeated vehemently, \"Phil, they'll find you! Get out of there:\nthe way is still open!\"\n\nGutierrez was approaching the archway. But I lingered a moment longer.\n\n\"Chief, you heard about that girl, Jetta, Spawn's daughter--\"\n\nI stopped. Perona was saying, \"Spawn, was Jetta still in her room? You\ndid not untie her?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And gagged? Suppose the Americano was back there now? She might call to\nhim, and he would release her--\"\n\nDe Boer: \"How do you know he is not around here? Listening?\"\n\nWith the assumption that I might be within hearing, De Boer tried to\ntrap me. Gutierrez, at a signal now, suddenly dashed through the archway\nand planted himself on the path outside. The other searchers spread\ntheir rays; the rocks all about me were lighted. But my niche was still\nuntouched.\n\nDe Boer: \"If he is around here--\"\n\nPerona: \"He could not have followed me; I was too careful.\"\n\nI was murmuring: \"Chief, they've got that girl.\"\n\n\"Phil, you get away! Go to Markes. Stay with him.\"\n\n\"But Chief, that Jetta, I--\"\n\n\"Keep out of this! You're only one; you can't help any! I've sent for\nthe Porto Rican patrol ship to handle this.\"\n\n\"Chief, I'm going back to Spawn's.\"\n\n\"No--\"\n\nI cut off abruptly. In another moment I would have been discovered. The\nsearchers were headed directly for me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI moved, crouching, back along the inner wall of the archway. The moon\nwas momentarily behind a cloud. It was black under the arch; and out\nfront it was so dim I could only see the faint blob of Gutierrez's\nstanding figure, and the spot of his flashlight.\n\nPerona: \"He is not around here, De Boer. That is foolish.\"\n\nSpawn: \"He could have gone anywhere. Maybe a walk around the village.\"\n\nPerona: \"Go back home, Spawn. De Boer will come--\"\n\nTheir voices faded as I moved away. A searching bandit behind me poked\nwith his light into the crevice where a moment before I had been\ncrouching. I moved faster. Only Gutierrez now was in front of me. He was\nat the far end of the arch. I could slip past, and still be fifty feet\nfrom him--if I could avoid his swinging little light-beam.\n\nI was running now, chancing that he would hear me. I was on the path; I\ncould see it vaguely.\n\nFrom behind me came a sizzling flash, and the ting of the flying needle\nas it missed me by a foot.\n\n\"The Americano! He goes there!\"\n\nAnother shot. The shouts of the bandits in the archway. A turmoil back\nthere.\n\nBut it was all behind me. I leaped sidewise off the path as Gutierrez\nsmall light-beam swept it. I ran stumbling through a stubble of\nboulders, around an upstanding rock spire, back to the path again.\n\nThere were other shots. Then De Boer's voice, faint by distance: \"Stop!\nFools! We will alarm the village! The landing field can see our shots\nfrom here! Take it easy! You can't get him!\"\n\nThe turmoil quieted. I went around a bend in the path, running swiftly.\n\nPursuit was behind me. I could hear them coming.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a run of no more than ten minutes to the junction where, down the\nslope, I could see the lights of the landing field.\n\nThe glow of the village was ahead of me. Then I was in its outskirts.\nOccasional dark houses. Deserted streets.\n\nI slowed to a fast walk. I was breathless, panting in the heat.\n\nI heard no pursuit now. But Spawn and the rest of them doubtless were\nafter me. Would they head back for Spawn's inn? I thought they would.\nBut I could beat them back there; I was sure there was no shorter route\nthan this I was taking.\n\nWould they use their flyer? That would not gain them any time, what\nwith launching it and landing, for so short a flight. And a bandit flyer\ncould not very well land unseen or unnoticed, even in somnolent Nareda.\n\nI reached the main section of the village. There were occasional lights\nand pedestrians. My haste was noticeable, but I was not accosted. There\nseemed no police about. I recalled Perona's remark that he had attended\nto that.\n\nMy electrode was tingling. I had been running again. I slowed down.\n\n\"Chief?\"\n\n\"Phil.\" His voice carried relief. \"You got away?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm in the village.\"\n\n\"Go to President Markes.\"\n\n\"No, I'm headed for Spawn's! They're all behind me; I can get there a\nfew minutes ahead of them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI panted an exclamation, incoherently, but frankly, about Jetta. \"I'm\ngoing to get her out of there.\"\n\n\"Phil, what in hell--\"\n\nI told him.\n\n\"So you've fallen in love with a girl? Entangled--\"\n\n\"Chief!\"\n\n\"Go after her, Phil! Got her bound and gagged, have they? Going to marry\nher to this Perona? Like the Middle Ages?\"\n\nI had never seen this side of Hanley.\n\n\"Get her if you want her. Get her out of there. Take her to Markes--No,\nI wouldn't trust anybody in Nareda! Take her into the uplands behind the\nvillage. But keep away from that mine! Have you got flash-fuses?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI was within sight of Spawn's house. The street was dim and deserted. I\nwas running again.\n\nI panted. \"I'm--almost at Spawn's!\"\n\n\"Good! When it's over, whatever happens up there at the mine, then\nsignal the patrol.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI reached Spawn's front gate. The house and front garden were dark.\n\n\"Use your fuses, Phil. What colors?\"\n\n\"I have red and blue.\"\n\n\"I'll talk to the patrol ship again. Tell them to watch for you. Red and\nblue. Two short red flashes, a long blue.\"\n\n\"Right, Chief. I'm here at Spawn's, cutting off.\"\n\n\"Come back on when you can.\" His voice went anxious again. \"I'll wait\nhere.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nI cut silent. I ran through the front doorway of Spawn's inn. The living\nroom was dim and empty. Which way was Jetta's room? I could only guess.\n\nI had a few minutes, perhaps, before my pursuers would arrive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI reached the inner, patio garden. The moon was well out from under the\nclouds now. The patio shimmered, a silent, deserted fairyland.\n\n\"Jetta!\" I called it softly. Then louder. \"Jetta!\"\n\nSpawn's house was fairly large and rambling. There were so many rooms.\nJetta was gagged; how could she answer me? But I had no time to search\nfor her.\n\n\"Jetta?\"\n\nAnd then came her voice. \"Philip?\"\n\n\"Jetta! Which way? Where are you?\"\n\n\"Here! This way: in my room.\"\n\nA window and a door near the pergola. \"Jetta!\"\n\n\"Yes. I am in here. They tied me up. Not so loud, Phil: father will hear\nyou.\"\n\n\"He's gone out.\"\n\nI reached her garden door. Turned its handle. Rattled the door. Shoved\nfrantically with my shoulder!\n\nThe metal door was firmly sealed!\n\n_(To be continued)_\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: _One of the men rolled free and came lurching toward\nus._]\n\nThe Terrible Tentacles of L-472\n\n_By Sewell Peaslee Wright_\n\n\nIt was a big mistake. I should not have done it. By birth, by instinct,\nby training, by habit, I am a man of action. Or I was. It is queer that\nan old man cannot remember that he is no longer young.\n\n[Sidenote: Commander John Hanson of the Special Patrol Service records\nanother of his thrilling interplanetary assignments.]\n\nBut it was a mistake for me to mention that I had recorded, for the\narchives of the Council, the history of a certain activity of the\nSpecial Patrol--a bit of secret history[1] which may not be mentioned\nhere. Now they insist--by \"they\" I refer to the Chiefs of the Special\nPatrol Service--that I write of other achievements of the Service, other\nadventures worthy of note.\n\n[Footnote 1: Editors Note: \"The Forgotten Planet\" July 1930 issue of\nAstounding Stories]\n\nPerhaps that is the penalty of becoming old. From commander of the\n_Budi_, one of the greatest of the Special Patrol ships, to the duties\nof recording ancient history, for younger men to read and dream about.\nThat is a shrewd blow to one's pride.\n\nBut if I can, in some small way, add luster to the record of my service,\nit will be a fitting task for a man grown old and gray in that service;\nwork for hands too weak and palsied for sterner duties.\n\nBut I shall tell my stories in my own way; after all, they are my\nstories. And I shall tell the stories that appeal to me most. The\nuniverse has had enough and too much of dry history; these shall be\nadventurous tales to make the blood of a young man who reads them run a\ntrifle faster--and perhaps the blood of the old man who writes them.\n\nThis, the first, shall be the story of the star L-472. You know it\nto-day as Ibit, port-o'-call for interplanetary ships, and source of\nocrite for the universe, but to me it will always be L-472, the world of\nterrible tentacles.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy story begins nearly a hundred years ago--reckoned in terms of Earth\ntime, which is proper, since I am a native of Earth--when I was a young\nman. I was sub-commander, at the time, of the _Kalid_, one of the early\nships of the Special Patrol.\n\nWe had been called to Zenia on special orders, and Commander Jamison,\nafter an absence of some two hours, returned to the _Kalid_ with his\nface shining, one of his rare smiles telling me in advance that he had\nnews--and good news.\n\nHe hurried me up to the deserted navigating room and waved me to a seat.\n\n\"Hanson,\" he said. \"I'm glad to be the first to congratulate you. You\nare now Commander John Hanson, of the Special Patrol Ship _Kalid_!\"\n\n\"Sir.\" I gasped, \"do you mean--\"\n\nHis smile broadened. From the breast pocket of the trim blue and silver\nuniform of our Service he drew a long, crackling paper.\n\n\"Your commission,\" he said. \"I'm taking over the _Borelis_.\"\n\nIt was my turn to extend congratulations then; the _Borelis_ was the\nnewest and greatest ship of the Service. We shook hands, that ancient\ngesture of good-fellowship on Earth. But, as our hands unclasped,\nJamison's face grew suddenly grave.\n\n\"I have more than this news for you, however,\" he said slowly. \"You are\nto have a chance to earn your comet hardly.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI smiled broadly at the mention of the comet, the silver insignia, worn\nover the heart, that would mark my future rank as commander, replacing\nthe four-rayed star of a sub-commander which I wore now on my tunic.\n\n\"Tell me more, sir,\" I said confidently.\n\n\"You have heard of the Special Patrol Ship _Filanus_?\" asked my late\ncommander gravely.\n\n\"Reported lost in space,\" I replied promptly.\n\n\"And the _Dorlos_?\"\n\n\"Why--yes; she was at Base here at our last call,\" I said, searching his\nface anxiously. \"Peter Wilson was Second Officer on her--one of my best\nfriends. Why do you ask about her, sir?\"\n\n\"The _Dorlos_ is missing also,\" said Commander Jamison solemnly. \"Both\nof these ships were sent upon a particular mission. Neither of them has\nreturned. It is concluded that some common fate has overtaken them. The\n_Kalid_, under your command, is commissioned to investigate these\ndisappearances.\n\n\"You are not charged with the mission of these other ships; your orders\nare to investigate their disappearance. The course, together with the\nofficial patrol orders, I shall hand you presently, but with them go\nverbal orders.\n\n\"You are to lay and keep the course designated, which will take you well\nout of the beaten path to a small world which has not been explored,\nbut which has been circumnavigated a number of times by various ships\nremaining just outside the atmospheric envelope, and found to be without\nevidence of intelligent habitation. In other words, without cities,\nroads, canals, or other evidence of human handiwork or civilization.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I believe your instructions give you some of this information, but not\nall of it. This world, unnamed because of its uninhabited condition, is\ncharted only as L-472. Your larger charts will show it, I am sure. The\natmosphere is reported to be breatheable by inhabitants of Earth and\nother beings having the same general requirements. Vegetation is\nreported as dense, covering the five continents of the world to the\nedges of the northern and southern polar caps, which are small.\nTopographically, the country is rugged in the extreme, with many peaks,\napparently volcanic, but now inactive or extinct, on all of its five\nlarge continents.\"\n\n\"And am I to land there, sir?\" I asked eagerly.\n\n\"Your orders are very specific upon that point,\" said Commander Jamison.\n\"You are not to land until you have carefully and thoroughly\nreconnoitered from above, at low altitude. You will exercise every\npossible precaution. Your specific purpose is simply this: to determine,\nif possible, the fate of the other two ships, and report your findings\nat once. The Chiefs of the Service will then consider the matter, and\ntake whatever action may seem advisable to them.\" Jamison rose to his\nfeet and thrust out his hand in Earth's fine old salute of farewell.\n\n\"I must be going, Hanson,\" he said. \"I wish this patrol were mine\ninstead of yours. You are a young man for such a responsibility.\"\n\n\"But,\" I replied, with the glowing confidence of youth, \"I have the\nadvantage of having served under Commander Jamison!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe smiled as we shook again, and shook his head.\n\n\"Discretion can be learned only by experience,\" he said. \"But I wish you\nsuccess, Hanson; on this undertaking, and on many others. Supplies are\non their way now; the crew will return from leave within the hour. A\nyoung Zenian, name of Dival, I believe, is detailed to accompany you as\nscientific observer--purely unofficial capacity, of course. He has been\nordered to report to you at once. You are to depart as soon as feasible:\nyou know what that means. I believe that's all--Oh, yes! I had almost\nforgotten.\n\n\"Here, in this envelope, are your orders and your course, as well as all\navailable data on L-472. In this little casket is--your comet, Hanson. I\nknow you will wear it with honor!\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir!\" I said, a bit huskily. I saluted, and Commander\nJamison acknowledged the gesture with stiff precision. Commander Jamison\nalways had the reputation of being something of a martinet.\n\nWhen he had left, I picked up the thin blue envelope he had left. Across\nthe face of the envelope, in the--to my mind--jagged and unbeautiful\nUniversal script, was my name, followed by the proud title: \"_Commander,\nSpecial Patrol Ship Kalid._\" My first orders!\n\nThere was a small oval box, of blue leather, with the silver crest of\nthe Service in bas-relief on the lid. I opened the case, and gazed with\nshining eyes at the gleaming, silver comet that nestled there.\n\nThen, slowly, I unfastened the four-rayed star on my left breast, and\nplaced in its stead the insignia of my commandership.\n\nWorn smooth and shiny now, it is still my most precious possession.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKincaide, my second officer, turned and smiled as I entered the\nnavigating room.\n\n\"L-472 now registers maximum attraction, sir,\" he reported. \"Dead ahead,\nand coming up nicely. My last figures, completed about five minutes\nago, indicate that we should reach the gaseous envelope in about ten\nhours.\" Kincaide was a native of Earth, and we commonly used Earth\ntime-measurements in our conversation. As is still the case, ships of\nthe Special Patrol Service were commanded without exception by natives\nof Earth, and the entire officer personnel hailed largely from the same\nplanet, although I have had several Zenian officers of rare ability and\ncourage.\n\nI nodded and thanked him for the report. Maximum attraction, eh? That,\nconsidering the small size of our objective, meant we were much closer\nto L-472 than to any other regular body.\n\nMechanically, I studied the various dials about the room. The attraction\nmeter, as Kincaide had said, registered several degrees of attraction,\nand the red slide on the rim of the dial was squarely at the top,\nshowing that the attraction was coming from the world at which our nose\nwas pointed. The surface-temperature gauge was at normal. Internal\npressure, normal. Internal moisture-content, a little high. Kincaide,\nwatching me, spoke up:\n\n\"I have already given orders to dry out, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"Very good, Mr. Kincaide. It's a long trip, and I want the crew in good\ncondition.\" I studied the two charts, one showing our surroundings\nlaterally, the other vertically, all bodies about us represented as\nglowing spots of green light, of varying sizes; the ship itself as a\ntiny scarlet spark. Everything shipshape: perhaps, a degree or two of\nelevation when we were a little closer--\n\n\"May I come in sir?\" broke in a gentle, high-pitched voice.\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Dival,\" I replied, answering in the Universal language\nin which the request had been made. \"You are always very welcome.\" Dival\nwas a typical Zenian of the finest type: slim, very dark, and with the\namazingly intelligent eyes of his kind. His voice was very soft and\ngentle, and like the voice of all his people, clear and high-pitched.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said. \"I guess I'm over-eager, but there's something\nabout this mission of ours that worries me. I seem to feel--\" He broke\noff abruptly and began pacing back and forth across the room.\n\nI studied him, frowning. The Zenians have a strange way of being right\nabout such things; their high-strung, sensitive natures seem capable of\nresponding to those delicate, vagrant forces which even now are only\nincompletely understood and classified.\n\n\"You're not used to work of this sort,\" I replied, as bluffly and\nheartily as possible. \"There's nothing to worry about.\"\n\n\"The commanders of the two ships that disappeared probably felt the same\nway, sir,\" said Dival. \"I should have thought the Chiefs of the Special\nPatrol Service would have sent several ships on a mission such as this.\"\n\n\"Easy to say,\" I laughed bitterly. \"If the Council would pass the\nappropriations we need, we might have ships enough so that we could send\na fleet of ships when we wished. Instead of that, the Council, in its\ninfinite wisdom, builds greater laboratories and schools of higher\nlearning--and lets the Patrol get along as best it can.\"\n\n\"It was from the laboratories and the schools of higher learning that\nall these things sprang,\" replied Dival quietly, glancing around at the\narray of instruments which made navigation in space possible.\n\n\"True,\" I admitted rather shortly. \"We must work together. And as for\nwhat we shall find upon the little world ahead, we shall be there in\nnine or ten hours. You may wish to make some preparations.\"\n\n\"Nine or ten hours? That's Earth time, isn't it? Let's see: about two\nand a half enaros.\"\n\n\"Correct,\" I smiled. The Universal method of reckoning time had never\nappealed to me. For those of my readers who may only be familiar with\nEarth time measurements, an enar is about eighteen Earth days, an enaren\na little less than two Earth days, and an enaro nearly four and a half\nhours. The Universal system has the advantage, I admit, of a decimal\ndivision; but I have found it clumsy always. I may be stubborn and\nold-fashioned, but a clock face with only ten numerals and one hand\nstill strikes me as being unbeautiful and inefficient.\n\n\"Two and a half enaros,\" repeated Dival thoughtfully. \"I believe I shall\nsee if I can get a little sleep now; I should not have brought my books\nwith me, I'm afraid. I read when I should sleep. Will you call me should\nthere be any developments of interest?\"\n\nI assured him that he would be called as he requested, and he left.\n\n\"Decent sort of a chap, sir,\" observed Kincaide, glancing at the door\nthrough which Dival had just departed.\n\n\"A student,\" I nodded, with the contempt of violent youth for the man of\ngentler pursuits than mine, and turned my attentions to some\ncalculations for entry in the log.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBusied with the intricate details of my task, time passed rapidly. The\nwatch changed, and I joined my officers in the tiny, arched dining\nsalon. It was during the meal that I noticed for the first time a sort\nof tenseness; every member of the mess was unusually quiet. And though I\nwould not, have admitted it then, I was not without a good deal of\nnervous restraint myself.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" I remarked when the meal was finished, \"I believe you\nunderstand our present mission. Primarily, our purpose is to ascertain,\nif possible, the fate of two ships that were sent here and have not\nreturned. We are now close enough for reasonable observation by means of\nthe television disc, I believe, and I shall take over its operation\nmyself.\n\n\"There is no gainsaying the fact that whatever fate overtook the two\nother Patrol ships, may lay in wait for us. My orders are to observe\nevery possible precaution, and to return with a report. I am going to\nask that each of you proceed immediately to his post, and make ready, in\nso far as possible, for any eventuality. Warn the watch which has just\ngone off to be ready for instant duty. The disintegrator ray generators\nshould be started and be available for instant emergency use, maximum\npower. Have the bombing crews stand by for orders.\"\n\n\"What do you anticipate, sir?\" asked Correy, my new sub-commander. The\nother officers waited tensely for my reply.\n\n\"I don't know, Mr. Correy,\" I admitted reluctantly. \"We have no\ninformation upon which to base an assumption. We do know that two ships\nhave been sent here, and neither of them have returned. Something\nprevented that return. We must endeavor to prevent that same fate from\novertaking the _Kalid_--and ourselves.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHurrying back to the navigating room, I posted myself beside the\ncumbersome, old-fashioned television instrument. L-472 was near enough\nnow to occupy the entire field, with the range hand at maximum. One\nwhole continent and parts of two others were visible. Not many details\ncould be made out.\n\nI waited grimly while an hour, two hours, went by. My field narrowed\ndown to one continent, to a part of one continent. I glanced up at the\nsurface temperature gauge and noted that the hand was registering a few\ndegrees above normal. Correy, who had relieved Kincaide as navigating\nofficer, followed my gaze.\n\n\"Shall we reduce speed, sir?\" he asked crisply.\n\n\"To twice atmospheric speed,\" I nodded. \"When we enter the envelope\nproper, reduce to normal atmospheric speed. Alter your course upon\nentering the atmosphere proper, and work back and forth along the\nemerging twilight zone, from the north polar cap to the southern cap,\nand so on.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" he replied, and repeated the orders to the control room\nforward.\n\nI pressed the attention signal to Dival's cubicle, and informed him that\nwe were entering the outer atmospheric fringe.\n\n\"Thank you, sir!\" he said eagerly. \"I shall be with you immediately.\"\n\nIn rapid succession I called various officers and gave terse orders.\nDouble crews on duty in the generator compartment, the ray projectors,\nthe atomic bomb magazines, and release tubes. Observers at all\nobservation posts, operators at the two smaller television instruments\nto comb the terrain and report instantly any object of interest. With\nthe three of us searching, it seemed incredible that anything could\nescape us. At atmospheric altitudes even the two smaller television\ninstruments would be able to pick out a body the size of one of the\nmissing ships.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDival entered the room as I finished giving my orders.\n\n\"A strange world, Dival,\" I commented, glancing towards the television\ninstrument. \"Covered with trees, even the mountains, and what I presume\nto be volcanic peaks. They crowd right down to the edge of the water.\"\n\nHe adjusted the focusing lever slightly, his face lighting up with the\ninterest of a scientist gazing at a strange specimen, whether it be a\nmicrobe or a new world.\n\n\"Strange ... strange ...\" he muttered. \"A universal vegetation ... no\nvariation of type from equator to polar cap, apparently. And the\nwater--did you notice its color, sir?\"\n\n\"Purple,\" I nodded. \"It varies on the different worlds, you know. I've\nseen pink, red, white and black seas, as well as the green and blue of\nEarth.\"\n\n\"And no small islands,\" he went on, as though he had not ever heard me.\n\"Not in the visible portion, at any rate.\"\n\nI was about to reply, when I felt the peculiar surge of the _Kalid_ as\nshe reduced speed. I glanced at the indicator, watching the hand drop\nslowly to atmospheric speed.\n\n\"Keep a close watch, Dival,\" I ordered. \"We shall change our course now,\nto comb the country for traces of two ships we are seeking. If you see\nthe least suspicious sign, let me know immediately.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe nodded, and for a time there was only a tense silence in the room,\nbroken at intervals by Correy as he spoke briefly into his microphone,\ngiving orders to the operating room.\n\nPerhaps an hour went by. I am not sure. It seemed like a longer time\nthan that. Then Dival called out in sudden excitement, his high, thin\nvoice stabbing the silence:\n\n\"Here, sir! Look! A little clearing--artificial, I judge--and the ships!\nBoth of them!\"\n\n\"Stop the ship, Mr. Correy!\" I snapped as I hurried to the instrument.\n\"Dival, take those reports.\" I gestured towards the two attention\nsignals that were glowing and softly humming and thrust my head into the\nshelter of the television instrument's big hood.\n\nDival had made no mistake. Directly beneath me, as I looked, was a\nclearing, a perfect square with rounded corners, obviously blasted out\nof the solid forest by the delicate manipulation of sharply focused\ndisintegrator rays. And upon the naked, pitted surface thus exposed,\nside by side in orderly array, were the missing ships!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI studied the strange scene with a heart that thumped excitedly against\nmy ribs.\n\nWhat should I do? Return and report? Descend and investigate? There was\nno sign of life around the ships, and no evidence of damage. If I\nbrought the _Kalid_ down, would she make a third to remain there, to be\nmarked \"lost in space\" on the records of the Service?\n\nReluctantly, I drew my head from beneath the shielding hood.\n\n\"What were the two reports, Dival?\" I asked, and my voice was thick.\n\"The other two television observers?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. They report that they cannot positively identify the ships\nwith their instruments, but feel certain that they are the two we seek.\"\n\n\"Very good. Tell them, please, to remain on watch, searching space in\nevery direction, and to report instantly anything suspicious. Mr.\nCorrey, we will descend until this small clearing becomes visible,\nthrough the ports, to the unaided eye. I will give you the corrections\nto bring us directly over the clearing.\" And I read the finder scales of\nthe television instrument to him.\n\nHe rattled off the figures, calculated an instant, and gave his orders\nto the control room, while I kept the television instrument bearing upon\nthe odd clearing and the two motionless, deserted ships.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs we settled, I could make out the insignia of the ships, could see the\npitted, stained earth of the clearing, brown with the dust of\ndisintegration. I could see the surrounding trees very distinctly now:\nthey seemed very similar to our weeping willows, on Earth, which, I\nperhaps should explain, since it is impossible for the average\nindividual to have a comprehensive knowledge of the flora and fauna of\nthe entire known Universe, is a tree of considerable size, having long,\nhanging branches arching from its crown and reaching nearly to the\nground. These leaves, like typical willow leaves, were long and slender,\nof rusty green color. The trunks and branches seemed to be black or dark\nbrown: and the trees grew so thickly that nowhere between their branches\nwas the ground visible.\n\n\"Five thousand feet, sir,\" said Correy. \"Directly above the clearing.\nShall we descend further?\"\n\n\"A thousand feet at a time, Mr. Correy,\" I replied, after a moment's\nhesitation. \"My orders are to exercise the utmost caution. Mr. Dival,\nplease make a complete analysis of the atmosphere. I believe you are\nfamiliar with the traps provided for the purpose?\"\n\n\"Yes. You propose to land, sir?\"\n\n\"I propose to determine the fate of those two ships and the men who\nbrought them here,\" I said with sudden determination. Dival made no\nreply, but as he turned to obey orders, I saw that his presentiment of\ntrouble had not left him.\n\n\"Four thousand feet, sir,\" said Correy.\n\nI nodded, studying the scene below us. The great hooded instrument\nbrought it within, apparently, fifty feet of my eyes, but the great\ndetail revealed nothing of interest.\n\nThe two ships lay motionless, huddled close together. The great circular\ndoor of each was open, as though opened that same day--or a century\nbefore.\n\n\"Three thousand feet, sir,\" said Correy.\n\n\"Proceed at the same speed,\" I replied. Whatever fate had overtaken the\nmen of the other ships had caused them to disappear entirely--and\nwithout sign of a struggle. But what conceivable fate could that be?\n\n\"Two thousand feet, sir,\" said Correy.\n\n\"Good,\" I said grimly. \"Continue with the descent, Mr. Correy.\"\n\nDival hurried into the room as I spoke. His face was still clouded with\nforeboding.\n\n\"I have tested the atmosphere, sir,\" he reported. \"It is suitable for\nbreathing by either men of Earth or Zenia. No trace of noxious gases of\nany kind. It is probably rather rarified, such as one might find on\nEarth or Zenia at high altitudes.\"\n\n\"One thousand feet, sir,\" said Correy.\n\nI hesitated an instant. Undoubtedly the atmosphere had been tested by\nthe other ships before they landed. In the case of the second ship, at\nany rate, those in command must have been on the alert against danger.\nAnd yet both of those ships lay there motionless, vacant, deserted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could feel the eyes of the men on me. My decision must be delayed no\nfurther.\n\n\"We will land, Mr. Correy,\" I said grimly. \"Near the two ships, please.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" nodded Correy, and spoke briefly into the microphone.\n\n\"I might warn you, sir,\" said Dival quietly, \"to govern your activities,\nonce outside: free from the gravity pads of the ship, on a body of such\nsmall size, an ordinary step will probably cause a leap of considerable\ndistance.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Dival. That is a consideration I had overlooked. I shall\nwarn the men. We must--\"\n\nAt that instant I felt the slight jar of landing. I glanced up; met\nCorrey's grave glance squarely.\n\n\"Grounded, sir,\" he said quietly.\n\n\"Very good, Mr. Correy. Keep the ship ready for instant action, please,\nand call the landing crew to the forward exit. You will accompany us,\nMr. Dival?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir!\"\n\n\"Good. You understand your orders, Mr. Correy?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\nI returned his salute, and led the way out of the room, Dival close on\nmy heels.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe landing crew was composed of all men not at regular stations; nearly\nhalf of the _Kalid's_ entire crew. They were equipped with the small\natomic power pistols as side-arms, and there were two three-men\ndisintegrator ray squads. We all wore menores, which were unnecessary\nin the ship, but decidedly useful outside. I might add that the menore\nof those days was not the delicate, beautiful thing that it is to-day:\nit was comparatively crude, and clumsy band of metal, in which were\nimbedded the vital units and the tiny atomic energy generator, and was\nworn upon the head like a crown. But for all its clumsiness, it conveyed\nand received thought, and, after all, that was all we demanded of it.\n\nI caught a confused jumble of questioning thoughts as I came up, and\ntook command of the situation promptly. It will be understood, of\ncourse, that in those days men had not learned to blank their minds\nagainst the menore, as they do to-day. It took generations of training\nto perfect that ability.\n\n\"Open the exit,\" I ordered Kincaide, who was standing by the switch, key\nin the lock.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he thought promptly, and unlocking the switch, released the\nlever.\n\nThe great circular door revolved swiftly, backing slowly on its fine\nthreads, gripped by the massive gimbals which, as at last the ponderous\nplug of metal freed itself from its threads, swung the circular door\naside, like the door of a vault.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFresh clean air swept in, and we breathed, it gratefully. Science can\nrevitalize air, take out impurities and replace used-up constituents,\nbut if cannot give it the freshness of pure natural air. Even the\nscience of to-day.\n\n\"Mr. Kincaide, you will stand by with five men. Under no circumstances\nare you to leave your post until ordered to do so. No rescue parties,\nunder any circumstances, are to be sent out unless you have those orders\ndirectly from me. Should any untoward thing happen to this party, you\nwill instantly reseal this exit, reporting at the same time to Mr.\nCorrey, who has his orders. You will not attempt to rescue us, but will\nreturn to the Base and report in full, with Mr. Correy in command. Is\nthat clear?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" came back his response instantly; but I could sense the\nrebellion in his mind. Kincaid and I were old friends, as well as fellow\nofficers.\n\nI smiled at him reassuringly, and directed my orders to the waiting men.\n\n\"You are aware of the fate of the two ships of the Patrol that have\nalready landed here,\" I thought slowly, to be sure they understood\nperfectly. \"What fate overtook them, I do not know. That is what we are\nhere to determine.\"\n\n\"It is obvious that this is a dangerous mission. I'm ordering none of\nyou to go. Any man who wishes to be relieved from landing duty may\nremain inside the ship, and may feel it no reproach. Those who do go\nshould be constantly on the alert, and keep in formation; the usual\ncolumn of twos. Be very careful, when stepping out of the ship, to\nadjust your stride to the lessened gravity of this small world. Watch\nthis point!\" I turned to Dival, motioned him to fall in at my side.\nWithout a backward glance, we marched out of the ship, treading very\ncarefully to keep from leaping into the air with each step.\n\nTwenty feet away, I glanced back. There were fourteen men behind me--not\na man of the landing crew had remained in the ship!\n\n\"I am proud of you men!\" I thought heartily: and no emanation from any\nmenore was ever more sincere.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCautiously, eyes roving ceaselessly, we made our way towards the two\nsilent ships. It seemed a quiet, peaceful world: an unlikely place for\ntragedy. The air was fresh and clean, although, as Dival had predicted,\nrarefied like the air at an altitude. The willow-like trees that hemmed\nus in rustled gently, their long, frond-like branches with their rusty\ngreen leaves swaying.\n\n\"Do you notice, sir,\" came a gentle thought from Dival, an emanation\nthat could hardly have been perceptible to the men behind us, \"that\nthere is no wind--and yet the trees, yonder, are swaying and rustling?\"\n\nI glanced around, startled. I had not noticed the absence of a breeze.\n\nI tried to make my response reassuring:\n\n\"There is probably a breeze higher up, that doesn't dip down into this\nlittle clearing,\" I ventured. \"At any rate, it is not important. These\nships are what interest me. What will we find there?\"\n\n\"We shall soon know,\" replied Dival. \"Here is the _Dorlos_; the second\nof the two, was it not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" I came to a halt beside the gaping door. There was no sound\nwithin, no evidence of life there, no sign that men had ever crossed\nthat threshold, save that the whole fabric was the work of man's hands.\n\n\"Mr. Dival and I will investigate the ship, with two of you men,\" I\ndirected. \"The rest of the detail will remain on guard, and give the\nalarm at the least sign of any danger. You first two men, follow us.\"\nThe indicated men nodded and stepped forward. Their \"Yes, sirs\" came\nsurging through my menore like a single thought. Cautiously, Dival at my\nside, the two men at our backs, we stepped over the high threshold into\nthe interior of the _Dorlos_.\n\nThe _ethon_ tubes overhead made everything as light as day, and since\nthe _Dorlos_ was a sister ship of my own _Kalid_, I had not the\nslightest difficulty in finding my way about.\n\nThere was no sign of a disturbance anywhere. Everything was in perfect\norder. From the evidence, it would seem that the officers and men of the\n_Dorlos_ had deserted the ship of their own accord, and--failed to\nreturn.\n\n\"Nothing of value here,\" I commented to Dival. \"We may as well--\"\n\nThere was a sudden commotion from outside the ship. Startled shouts\nrang through the hollow hull, and a confused medley of excited thoughts\ncame pouring in.\n\nWith one accord the four of us dashed to the exit, Dival and I in the\nlead. At the door we paused, following the stricken gaze of the men\ngrouped in a rigid knot just outside.\n\nSome, forty feet away was the edge of the forest that hemmed us in. A\nforest that now was lashing and writhing as though in the grip of some\nterrible hurricane, trunks bending and whipping, long branches writhing,\ncurling, lashing out--\n\n\"Two of the men, sir!\" shouted a non-commissioned officer of the landing\ncrew, as we appeared in the doorway. In his excitement he forgot his\nmenore, and resorted to the infinitely slower but more natural speech.\n\"Some sort of insect came buzzing down--like an Earth bee, but larger.\nOne of the men slapped it, and jumped aside, forgetting the low gravity\nhere. He shot into the air, and another of the men made a grab for him.\nThey both went sailing, and the trees--_look!_\"\n\nBut I had already spotted the two men. The trees had them in their grip,\nlong tentacles curled around them, a dozen of the great willow-like\ngrowths apparently fighting for possession of the prizes. And all\naround, far out of reach, the trees of the forest were swaying\nrestlessly, their long, pendulous branches, like tentacles, lashing out\nhungrily.\n\n\"The rays, sir!\" snapped the thought from Dival, like a flash of\nlightning. \"Concentrate the beams--strike at the trunks--\"\n\n\"Right!\" My orders emanated on the heels of the thought more quickly\nthan one word could have been uttered. The six men who operated the\ndisintegrator rays were stung out of their startled immobility, and the\nsoft hum of the atomatic power generators deepened.\n\n\"Strike at the trunks of the trees! Beams narrowed to minimum! Action at\nwill!\"\n\nThe invisible rays swept long gashes into the forest as the trainers\nsquatted behind their sights, directing the long, gleaming tubes.\nBranches crashed to the ground, suddenly motionless. Thick brown dust\ndropped heavily. A trunk, shortened by six inches or so, dropped into\nits stub and fell with a prolonged sound of rending wood. The trees\nagainst which it had fallen tugged angrily at their trapped tentacles.\n\nOne of the men rolled free, staggered to his feet, and came lurching\ntowards us. Trunk after trunk dropped onto its severed stub and fell\namong the lashing branches of its fellows. The other man was caught for\na moment in a mass of dead and motionless wood, but a cunningly directed\nray dissolved the entangling branches around him and he lay there, free\nbut unable to arise.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rays played on ruthlessly. The brown, heavy powder was falling like\ngreasy soot. Trunk after trunk crashed to the ground, slashed into\nfragments.\n\n\"Cease action!\" I ordered, and instantly the eager whine of the\ngenerators softened to a barely discernible hum. Two of the men, under\norders, raced out to the injured man: the rest of us clustered around\nthe first of the two to be freed from the terrible tentacles of the\ntrees.\n\nHis menore was gone, his tight-fitting uniform was in shreds, and\nblotched with blood. There was a huge crimson welt across his face, and\nblood dripped slowly from the tips of his fingers.\n\n\"_God!_\" he muttered unsteadily as kindly arms lifted him with eager\ntenderness. \"They're alive! Like snakes. They--they're _hungry_!\"\n\n\"Take him to the ship,\" I ordered. \"He is to receive treatment\nimmediately,\" I turned to the detail that was bringing in the other\nvictim. The man was unconscious, and moaning, but suffering more from\nshock than anything else. A few minutes under the helio emanations and\nhe would be fit for light duty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the men hurried him to the ship, I turned to Dival. He was standing\nbeside me, rigid, his face very pale, his eyes fixed on space.\n\n\"What do you make of it, Mr. Dival?\" I questioned him.\n\n\"Of the trees?\" He seemed startled, as though I had aroused him from\ndeepest thought. \"They are not difficult to comprehend, sir. There are\nnumerous growths that are primarily carnivorous. We have the fintal vine\non Zenia, which coils instantly when touched, and thus traps many small\nanimals which it wraps about with its folds and digests through\nsucker-like growths.\n\n\"On your own Earth there are, we learn, hundreds of varieties of\ninsectivorous plants: the Venus fly-trap, known otherwise as the Dionaea\nMuscipula, which has a leaf hinged in the median line, with teeth-like\nbristles. The two portions of the leaf snap together with considerable\nforce when an insect alights upon the surface, and the soft portions of\nthe catch are digested by the plant before the leaf opens again. The\npitcher plant is another native of Earth, and several varieties of it\nare found on Zenia and at least two other planets. It traps its game\nwithout movement, but is nevertheless insectivorous. You have another\nspecies on Earth that is, or was, very common: the Mimosa Pudica.\nPerhaps you know it as the sensitive plant. It does not trap insects,\nbut it has a very distinct power of movement, and is extremely\nirritable.\n\n\"It is not at all difficult to understand a carniverous tree, capable of\nviolent and powerful motion. This is undoubtedly what we have here--a\ndecidedly interesting phenomena, but not difficult of comprehension.\"\n\nIt seems like a long explanation, as I record it here, but emanated as\nit was, it took but an instant to complete it. Mr. Dival went on\nwithout a pause:\n\n\"I believe, however, that I have discovered something far more\nimportant. How is your menore adjusted, sir?\"\n\n\"At minimum.\"\n\n\"Turn it to maximum, sir.\"\n\nI glanced at him curiously, but obeyed. New streams of thought poured in\nupon me. Kincaide ... the guard at the exit ... _and something else_.\n\nI blanked out Kincaide and the men, feeling Dival's eyes searching my\nface. There was something else, something--\n\nI focused on the dim, vague emanations that came to me from the circlet\nof my menore, and gradually, like an object seen through heavy mist, I\nperceived the message:\n\n\"Wait! Wait! We are coming! Through the ground. The trees ...\ndisintegrate them ... all of them ... all you can reach. But not the\nground ... not the ground....\"\n\n\"Peter!\" I shouted, turning to Dival. \"That's Peter Wilson, second\nofficer of the _Dorlos_!\"\n\nDival nodded, his dark face alight.\n\n\"Let us see if we can answer him,\" he suggested, and we concentrated all\nour energy on a single thought: \"We understand. We understand.\"\n\nThe answer came back instantly:\n\n\"Good! Thank God! Sweep them down, Hanson: every tree of them. Kill them\n... kill them ... kill them!\" The emanation fairly shook with hate. \"We\nare coming ... to the clearing ... wait--and while you wait, use your\nrays upon these accursed hungry trees!\"\n\nGrimly and silently we hurried back to the ship. Dival, the savant,\nsnatching up specimens of earth and rock here and there as we went.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe disintegrator rays of the portable projectors were no more than toys\ncompared with the mighty beams the _Kalid_ was capable of projecting,\nwith her great generators to supply power. Even with the beams narrowed\nto the minimum, they cut a swath a yard or more in diameter, and their\nrange was tremendous; although working rather less rapidly as the\ndistance and power decreased, they were effective over a range of many\nmiles.\n\nBefore their blasting beams the forest shriveled and sank into tumbled\nchaos. A haze of brownish dust hung low over the scene, and I watched\nwith a sort of awe. It was the first time I had ever seen the rays at\nwork on such wholesale destruction.\n\nA startling thing became evident soon after we began our work. This\nworld that we had thought to be void of animal life, proved to be\nteeming with it. From out of the tangle of broken and harmless branches,\nthousands of animals appeared. The majority of them were quite large,\nperhaps the size of full-grown hogs, which Earth animal they seemed to\nresemble, save that they were a dirty yellow color, and had strong,\nheavily-clawed feet. These were the largest of the animals, but there\nwere myriads of smaller ones, all of them pale or neutral in color, and\napparently unused to such strong light, for they ran blindly, wildly\nseeking shelter from the universal confusion.\n\nStill the destructive beams kept about their work, until the scene\nchanged utterly. Instead of resting in a clearing, the _Kalid_ was in\nthe midst of a tangle of fallen, wilting branches that stretched like a\ngreat, still sea, as far as the eye could see.\n\n\"Cease action!\" I ordered suddenly. I had seen, or thought I had seen, a\nhuman figure moving in the tangle, not far from the edge of the\nclearing. Correy relayed the order, and instantly the rays were cut off.\nMy menore, free from the interference of the great atomic generators of\nthe _Kalid_, emanated the moment the generators ceased functioning.\n\n\"Enough. Hanson! Cut the rays; we're coming.\"\n\n\"We have ceased action; come on!\"\n\nI hurried to the still open exit. Kincaide and his guards were staring\nat what had been the forest; they were so intent that they did not\nnotice I had joined them--and no wonder!\n\nA file of men were scrambling over the debris; gaunt men with\ndishevelled hair, practically naked, covered with dirt and the greasy\nbrown dust of the disintegrator ray. In the lead, hardly recognizable,\nhis menore awry upon his tangled locks, was Peter Wilson.\n\n\"Wilson!\" I shouted; and in a single great leap I was at his side,\nshaking his hand, one arm about his scarred shoulders, laughing and\ntalking excitedly, all in the same breath. \"Wilson, tell me--in God's\nname--what has happened?\"\n\nHe looked up at me with shining, happy eyes, deep in black sockets of\nhunger and suffering.\n\n\"The part that counts,\" he said hoarsely, \"is that you're here, and we're\nhere with you. My men need rest and food--not too much food, at first,\nfor we're starving. I'll give you the story--or as much of it as I\nknow--while we eat.\"\n\nI sent my orders ahead; for every man of that pitiful crew of survivors,\nthere were two eager men of the _Kalid's_ crew to minister to him. In\nthe little dining salon of the officers' mess, Wilson gave us the story,\nwhile he ate slowly and carefully, keeping his ravenous hunger in check.\n\n\"It's a weird sort of story,\" he said. \"I'll cut it as short as I can.\nI'm too weary for details.\n\n\"The _Dorlos_, as I suppose you know, was ordered to L-472 to determine\nthe fate of the _Filanus_, which had been sent here to determine the\nfeasibility of establishing a supply base here for a new interplanetary\nship line.\n\n\"It took us nearly three days, Earth time, to locate this clearing and\nthe _Filanus_, and we grounded the _Dorlos_ immediately. Our\ncommander--you probably remember him, Hanson: David McClellan? Big,\nred-faced chap?\"\n\nI nodded, and Wilson continued.\n\n\"Commander McClellan was a choleric person, as courageous a man as ever\nwore the blue and silver of the Service, and very thoughtful of his men.\nWe had had a bad trip; two swarms of meteorites that had worn our nerves\nthin, and a faulty part in the air-purifying apparatus had nearly done\nus in. While the exit was being unsealed, he gave the interior crew\npermission to go off duty, to get some fresh air, with orders, however,\nto remain close to the ship, under my command. Then, with the usual\nlanding crew, he started for the _Filanus_.\n\n\"He had forgotten, under the stress of the moment, that the force of\ngravity would be very small on a body no larger than this. The result\nwas that as soon as they hurried out of the ship, away from the\ninfluence of our own gravity pads, they hurtled into the air in all\ndirections.\"\n\nWilson paused. Several seconds passed before he could go on.\n\n\"Well, the trees--I suppose you know something about them--reached out\nand swept up three of them. McClellan and the rest of the landing crew\nrushed to their rescue. They were caught up. _God!_ I can see them ...\nhear them ... even now!\n\n\"I couldn't stand there and see that happen to them. With the rest of\nthe crew behind me, we rushed out, armed only with our atomic pistols.\nWe did not dare use the rays; there were a dozen men caught up\neverywhere in those hellish tentacles.\n\n\"I don't know what I thought we could do. I knew only that I must do\nsomething. Our leaps carried us over the tops of the trees that were\nfighting for the ... the bodies of McClellan and the rest of the landing\ncrew. I saw then, when it was too late, that there was nothing we could\ndo. The trees ... had done their work. They ... they were _feeding_....\n\n\"Perhaps that is why we escaped. We came down in a tangle of whipping\nbranches. Several of my men were snatched up. The rest of us saw how\nhelpless our position was ... that there was nothing we could do. We\nsaw, too, that the ground was literally honeycombed, and we dived down\nthese burrows, out of the reach of the trees.\n\n\"There were nineteen of us that escaped. I can't tell you how we\nlived--I would not if I could. The burrows had been dug by the pig-like\nanimals that the trees live upon, and they led, eventually, to the\nshore, where there was water--horrible, bitter stuff, but not salty, and\napparently not poisonous.\"\n\nWe lived on these pig-like animals, and we learned something of their\nway of life. The trees seem to sleep, or become inactive, at night. Not\nunless they are touched do they lash about with their tentacles. At\nnight the animals feed, largely upon the large, soft fruit of these\ntrees. Of course, large numbers of them make a fatal step each night,\nbut they are prolific, and their ranks do not suffer.\n\n\"Of course, we tried to get back to the clearing, and the _Dorlos_;\nfirst by tunneling. That was impossible, we found, because the rays used\nby the _Filanus_ in clearing a landing place had acted somewhat upon the\nearth beneath, and it was like powder. Our burrows fell in upon us\nfaster than we could dig them out! Two of my men lost their lives that\nway.\n\n\"Then we tried creeping back by night; but we could not see as can the\nother animals here, and we quickly found that it was suicide to attempt\nsuch tactics. Two more of the men were lost in that fashion. That left\nfourteen.\n\n\"We decided then to wait. We knew there would be another ship along,\nsooner or later. Luckily, one of the men had somehow retained his\nmenore. We treasured that as we treasured our lives. To-day, when, deep\nin our runways beneath the surface, we felt, or heard, the crashing of\nthe trees, we knew the Service had not forgotten us. I put on the\nmenore; I--but I think you know the rest, gentlemen. There were eleven\nof us left. We are here--all that is left of the _Dorlos_ crew. We found\nno trace of any survivor of the _Filanus_; unaware of the possibility of\ndanger, they were undoubtedly, all the victims of ... the trees.\"\n\nWilson's head dropped forward on his chest. He straightened up with a\nstart and an apologetic smile.\n\n\"I believe, Hanson,\" he said slowly, \"I'd better get ... a little ...\nrest,\" and he slumped forward on the table in the death-like sleep of\nutter exhaustion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere the interesting part of the story ends. The rest is history, and\nthere is too much dry history in the Universe already.\n\nDival wrote three great volumes on L-472--or Ibit, as it is called now.\nOne of them tells in detail how the presence of constantly increasing\nquantities of volcanic ash robbed the soil of that little world of its\nvitality, so that all forms of vegetation except the one became extinct,\nand how, through a process of development and evolution, those trees\nbecame carniverous.\n\nThe second volume is a learned discussion of the tree itself; it seems\nthat a few specimens were spared for study, isolated on a peninsula of\none of the continents, and turned over to Dival for observation and\ndissection. All I can say for the book is that it is probably accurate.\nCertainly it is neither interesting nor comprehensible.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is his treatise on ocrite: how he happened\nto find the ore, the probable amount available on L-472--or Ibit, if you\nprefer--and an explanation of his new method of refining it. I saw him\nfrantically gathering specimens while we were getting ready to leave,\nbut it wasn't until after we had departed that he mentioned what he had\nfound.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have a set of these volumes somewhere; Dival autographed them and\npresented me with them. They established his position, I understand, in\nhis world of science, and of course, the discovery of this new source of\nocrite was a tremendous find for the whole Universe; interplanetary\ntransportation wouldn't be where it is to-day if it were not for this\ninexhaustible source of power.\n\nYes, Dival became famous--and very rich.\n\nI received the handshakes and the gratitude of the eleven men we\nrescued, and exactly nine words of commendation from the Chief of my\nsquadron: _\"You are a credit to the Service, Commander Hanson!\"_\n\nPerhaps, to some who read this, it will seem that Dival fared better\nthan I. But to men who have known the comradeship of the outer space,\nthe heart-felt gratitude of eleven friends is a precious thing. And to\nany man who has ever worn the blue and silver uniform of the Special\nPatrol Service, those nine words from the Chief of Squadron will sound\nstrong.\n\nChiefs of Squadrons in the Special Patrol Service--at least in those\ndays--were scanty with praise. It may be different in these days of soft\nliving and political pull.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nMarooned Under the Sea\n\n_By Paul Ernst_\n\n     (Editor's note: This document, written on a curious kind of\n     parchment and tied to a piece of driftwood, was reported to have\n     been picked out of the sea near the Fiji Islands. The first and\n     last pages were so water soaked as to be indecipherable.)\n\nYacht _Rosa_ was due to leave the San Francisco harbor in two hours.\n\nWe were going on some mysterious cruise to the South Seas, the details\nof which I did not know.\n\n[Sidenote: Three men stick out a strange and desperate adventure among\nthe incredible monsters of the dark sea floor.]\n\n\"Professor George Berry, the famous zoologist, and myself are going to\ndo some exploring that is hazardous in the extreme,\" Stanley had said.\n\"For purely mechanical reasons we need a third. You are young and have\nno family ties, so I thought I'd ask you to go with us.\nI'd rather not tell you what it's all about until we are on our way.\"\n\n[Illustration: _\"Look at the cable!\" called Stanley._]\n\nThat was all the explanation he had given. It was sufficient. I was\nfed-up with life just then: I had enough money to avoid work and was\ntired of playing.\n\n\"I must warn you that you'll risk your life in this,\" he had continued,\nin answer to my acceptance of his invitation.\n\nAnd I had replied that the hazard, whatever it might be, only made the\ntrip appear more desirable.\n\nSo here I was, on board the yacht, about to sail for far places on some\nscientific mission which had so far been kept veiled in secrecy and\nwhich was represented as \"hazardous in the extreme.\" It sounded\nattractive!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStanley came aboard accompanied by a lean, wiry man with iron gray hair\nand cool, alert black eyes.\n\n\"Hello, Martin,\" Stanley greeted me. \"I want you to meet Professor\nBerry, the real leader of this expedition. Professor, this young\nred-head is Martin Grey, a sort of nephew by adoption who knows more\nabout night life than most cabaret proprietors--and not much of anything\nelse. He has shaken the dangers of the gold-diggers to face with us the\ndangers of the tropic seas.\"\n\nThe professor gripped my hand, and his cool black eyes gazed into mine\nwith a kind of friendly frostiness.\n\n\"Don't pay any attention to him,\" he advised me. \"Twenty years ago, when\nI first met him, he was on his way to Africa to shoot elephants because\nsome revue beauty had just thrown him over and he felt he ought to do\nsomething big and heroic about it. It was shortly afterward that he\ndecided to stay a bachelor all his life, and became such a confirmed\nwoman hater.\"\n\nHe smiled thinly at Stanley's prod in the ribs, and the two went below,\ntalking and laughing with the intimacy of old friendship.\n\nI stayed on deck and soon found myself watching, with no little wonder,\nan enormous truck and trailer arrangement that drew up on the dock\nheavily loaded with a single immense crate. It was for us. I speculated\nas to what it could possibly contain.\n\nIt was a twenty or twenty-five-foot cube solidly braced with strap-iron\nand steel brackets. It evidently contained something fragile. The\nyacht's donkey engine lowered a hook for it, and swung it over the side\nand into the hold as daintily as though it had been packed with\nexplosives.\n\nThe last of the ship's stores followed it over the side: the group of\nnewspaper reporters who had been trying to pump the captain and first\nmate for a story were warned to leave, and we were ready to go.\nPrecisely where and for what purpose?\n\nI was to find out almost immediately.\n\nEven as the yacht nosed superciliously away from the dock, the steward\napproached me with the information that lunch was ready. I went to the\nsmall, compactly furnished dining salon, where I was joined by Stanley\nand the professor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were only the three of us at the table. Stanley Browne, noted big\ngame hunter and semi-retired owner of the great Browne Glassworks at\nAltoona, a man fifteen years my senior but tanned and fit looking;\nProfessor Berry, well known in scientific circles; and myself, known in\nno branch of activity save the one Stanley had jested about--the night\nlife of my home city, Chicago.\n\n\"It's time you knew just what you're up against,\" said Stanley to me\nafter the consomme had been served. \"Now that we've actually sailed,\nthere's no longer any need for secrecy. Indeed there never has been\nurgent need of it: the Professor and myself merely thought we might\nprovoke incredulity and comment if we stated the purpose of our trip\npublicly.\"\n\nHe buttered a roll.\n\n\"We--the Professor and you and I--are going in for some deep sea diving.\nAnd when I say deep, I mean deep. We are going to investigate conditions\nas they exist one mile down from the surface of the ocean.\"\n\n\"A mile!\" I exclaimed. \"Why--\"\n\nThere I stopped. I had only a layman's knowledge of such matters. But I\nknew that the limit of man's submersion, till then at any rate, was a\nmatter of a few hundred feet.\n\n\"Sounds incredible, doesn't it,\" said Stanley with a smile. \"But that's\nwhat we're going to do--if the Professor's gadget works as he seems to\nthink it will.\"\n\n\"I don't think it, I know it,\" retorted the Professor. \"And man, man,\nthe things we may see down there! New and unknown species--a world no\nhuman has ever seen before--perhaps the secret of all of life--\"\n\n\"Dragons, sea-serpents, and what not!\" Stanley finished with a grin.\n\n\"Or, possibly--nothing at all.\" The Professor shrugged. \"I mustn't let\nmy scientific curiosity run away with me. Perhaps we'll find no new\nthing down down. Our deep sea dredging and classification may already\nembrace most of the forms of life in the greater depths.\"\n\n\"If it does I want my money back,\" said Stanley. \"When you asked me to\nfinance this expedition for you, I agreed on condition that you would\nshow me a thrill--some _real_ big game, even if I would not be able to\nshoot it. If we draw blank--\"\n\n\"The mere descent should satisfy you, my adventuring friend,\" replied\nthe Professor brusquely. \"I think you'll find that thrilling enough.\"\n\n\"But--a mile under the surface!\" I marveled, feeling not entirely\ncomfortable. \"The pressure! Enormous! It can't be done! That is, I mean,\ncan it be done?\"\n\n\"It had better be,\" said Stanley with a humor that I did not entirely\nappreciate. \"If it isn't, the three of us are going to be pressed out\nlike three sheets of tissue paper! For we are assuredly going down that\nfar in the Professor's gadget.\"\n\n\"Was that the thing I saw hoisted aboard just before we left?\"\n\n\"That was it. We'll stroll around after lunch and look it over.\"\n\nIf I had taken this cruise in search of distraction--I was surely going\nto be successful! That was plain!\n\n\"Just where are we going?\" I asked. \"You said something about the South\nSeas, but you've named no special part of them.\"\n\n\"We're bound for Penguin Deep. That's a delightful little dimple in the\nKermadec Trough, which,\" Stanley explained, \"is north-northeast of New\nZealand almost halfway up to the Fiji Islands. Penguin Deep is ticketed\nat five thousand one hundred and fifty feet, but it probably runs deeper\nin spots.\"\n\nThe rest of the meal was consumed in silence. I hardly tasted what I\nate; I remember that. Over five thousand feet down--where no man had\never ventured before! Could we make it?\n\nI tried to recall my neglected physics lessons and compute the pressure\nthat far down. I couldn't. But I knew it must be an appalling total of\ntons to the square inch. What possible arrangement could they have\nbrought in which to make that awful descent?\n\nAnd, if the descent were accomplished, what in the world would we see\nwhen we got down there? Gigantic, hitherto unknown fishes? Marine\ngrowths, half animal and half vegetable?\n\nDecidedly, hot rolls and salad, cutlets and baked potatoes, good as they\nwere, could not distract attention from the crowding questions that\nassailed me. And I could see that Stanley and the Professor were also\nfar away in their thoughts--probably already exploring Penguin Deep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter lunch we went forward to look at the Professor's gadget, as\nStanley insisted on calling it.\n\nIt had been carefully unpacked by the crew while we ate, and it\nshimmered in the electric lighted hold like a great bubble.\n\nIt was a giant glass sphere, polished and flawless. Inside it could be\nmade out various objects--a circular bench arrangement on a wooden\nflooring, batteries that filled the cup between the floor and the bottom\narc of the sphere, tall metal cylinders, a small searchlight set next to\na mechanism that was indeterminate. At three equidistant points on the\nsides there were glass handles, as thick as a man's thigh, cast integral\nwith the walls. On the top there was a smaller handle.\n\nAt first glance the sphere seemed all in one piece, with the central\nobjects cast inside like a toy ship in a sealed bottle. Then a\nmathematically precise ring of prismatic reflections showed me that the\ntop third of the ball was a separate piece, fitting conically down like\nthe tapered glass stopper of a monstrous perfume bottle. The handle on\nthe top was for the purpose of lifting this giant's teapot lid, and\nallowing entrance into the sphere.\n\n\"Isn't it a beauty?\" murmured Stanley. \"It ought to be,\" he added. \"It\ncost me eighty-six thousand to make it in my own glass factory. Eleven\ncastings before this one came along that was reasonably free of flaws.\nTwenty-two feet six inches over all, walls five feet thick, new formula\nunbreakable glass, four men working a month to grind the lid into place,\ntolerance limits plus or minus zero.\"\n\nHe slapped the Professor's shoulders. \"Let's go in and look over the\napparatus.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo accommodate the huge ball a well had been constructed in the Rosa's\nhold. This brought the deck we were standing on up to within six feet of\nthe top ring, above which was rigged a chain hoist for lifting the\nponderous lid.\n\nThe hoist was revolved, the conical top was swung free, and we clambered\ninto our unique diving shell.\n\nThe tall cylinders were revealed as great flasks of compressed air. The\nindeterminate thing beside the searchlight turned out to be a hand pump,\ngeared to work against heavy pressure. From the suction chamber of this\nthree tubes extended.\n\n\"We inhale the air of the chamber,\" the Professor explained to me, \"and\nexhale through the tubes into the pump cylinder. Breathe in through the\nnose and out through the mouth. The pump piston is forced down by this\ngeared handle, sending the used air out of the shell through this\nsixteenth-inch hole. A ball check valve keeps the water from squirting\nin when the exhaust pressure is released.\"\n\nHe pointed to a telegraphic key which completed a circuit from the\nbatteries in the bottom of the ball to a thread of copper cast through\nthe lid.\n\n\"That's your plaything, Martin. You are to raise or lower us by pressing\nthat key. It controls the donkey engine electrically, so that we guide\nour own destinies though we are a mile beneath our power plant. Stanley\nworks the pump. I direct the searchlight, write down notes, and, I\nsincerely hope, take snapshots of deep sea life.\"\n\nFor a moment my part of the labor seemed so easy as to be unfair. Merely\nto sit there and punch a little key at raising and lowering time! But as\nI thought it over it began to appear more difficult.\n\nThe _Rosa_ could not anchor, of course, in a mile of water. We would\ndrift helplessly. If we approached an undersea cliff I must raise us at\nonce to prevent us being smashed against it. And if the cliff were too\nlofty to be cleared in time....\n\nI mentioned this to the Professor.\n\n\"That would be unfortunate,\" he said, with his frosty smile. \"Stanley\nassures us this glass is unbreakable. He means commercially unbreakable.\nWhat would happen to it if it were submitted to the strain of being\nflung against a rock pile--in addition to the enormous stress of the\nwater pressure--I don't know. It's your job to see that we don't have to\nfind out!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt had been planned to test the sphere empty first to see how it stood\nthe strain.\n\nWe drifted to a full stop over the center of Penguin Deep where we were\nto gamble our lives in a game with Neptune. Sea anchors were rigged to\nlessen our drift and the donkey engine was geared to the first cable\ndrum.\n\nThere was an impressive row of these drums, each holding an interminable\nlength of three-quarter-inch cable. The bulk of a mile of steel cable\nhas to be seen to be believed!\n\nThe glass sphere was lifted from the hold, delicately for all its\nenormous weight, and swung over the rail preparatory to being lowered\ninto the depths.\n\nNot until that moment did I notice two things: that there was no\nfastening of any kind to keep the thick lid in place: and that the\nthree-quarter-inch cable looked like a pack thread in comparison to the\nponderous bulk it strained to support.\n\n\"We couldn't use a heavier cable,\" said the Professor, \"because of the\nstrain. We're overloading the hoist as it is. As for the lid being\nfastened down--I think you'll find it will be pressed into place\nsecurely enough!\"\n\nThere was unanimous silence as the great globe slipped into the\nsea--down and down until the last reflection of the morning sun ceased\nto shimmer from its surface. Drum after drum was played out, till the\nfirst mate held his hand up to check the engineer.\n\n\"Five thousand feet, sir,\" he called to Stanley.\n\n\"Haul it back up. And let us hope,\" Stanley added fervently, \"that we'll\nfind the gadget in one piece.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe engine began to snort rhythmically. Dripping, vibrating, the coils\nof cable began to crawl back in place on the drums. There was a glint\nunder the surface again as the sunlight reflected on the nearing sphere.\n\nThe great ball flashed out of the water, and a cheer burst from the\nthroats of all of us. It was absolutely unharmed. Only--there was a\nbeading of fine moisture inside the thick globe. What that could mean,\nnone of us could figure out.\n\n\"Difference in temperature?\" worried the Professor. \"No, it's as cold\ninside as out. Molecules of water driven by sheer pressure through five\nfeet of glass to unite in drops on the inside? Possibly. Well, there's\none way to find out. Stanley, Martin--are you ready?\"\n\nWe nodded, and prepared to visit the bottom a mile below the _Rosa's_\nkeel. The preparation consisted merely in donning heavy, fleece-lined\njumpers to protect us from the cold of the sunless depths.\n\nSoberly we entered the ball to undergo whatever ordeal awaited us on\nthe distant ocean floor. How comparative distance is! A mile walk in the\ncountry--it is nothing. A mile ascent in an airplane--a trifle. But a\nmile descent into pitch black, bone chilling depths of water--that is an\nimmense distance!\n\nCopper wire, on a separate drum, was connected from the engine switch to\nthe copper thread that curled through the glass wall to my telegraphic\nkey. We strapped the mouthpieces of the breathing tubes over our heads,\nand Browne started the slow turning of the compression pump.\n\nThe Professor snapped the searchlight on and off several times to see\nthat it was in working shape. He raised his hand, I pressed the key, and\nthe long descent began.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat plunge into the bottomless depths remains in my memory almost as\nclearly as the far more fantastic adventures that came to us later.\n\nSmoothly, rapidly, the yellow-green of the surface water dimmed to\nolive. This in turn grew blacker and blacker. Then we were slipping down\ninto pitch darkness--a big bubble lit by a meagre lamp and containing\nthree fragile human beings that dared to trust the soft pulp of their\nbodies to the crushing weight of the deepest ocean.\n\nThe most impressive thing was the utter soundlessness of our descent. At\nfirst there had been a pulsing throb of the donkey engine transmitted to\nus by the sustaining cable. This died as we slid farther from the Rosa.\nAt length it was hushed entirely, cushioned by the springy length of\nsteel. There was no stir, no sound of any kind. As far as our senses\ncould tell us, we were hanging motionless in the pressing, awesome\nblackness.\n\nThe Professor switched off our light and turned on the searchlight which\nhe trained downward through the wall at as steep an angle as the\nflooring would permit. Even then the illusion of motionlessness was\npreserved. There was nothing in the water to mark our progress. We\nmight have been floating in a back void of space.\n\nDown and down we went, for an interminable length of time--till at\nlength we reached the abysmal level where the sun never shone and the\neyes of man had never gazed till now.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWords were made to describe familiar articles. I find now when I am\nfaced with the necessity of portraying events and objects beyond the\nrange of normal human experience that I cannot conjure up words to fit.\nI despair of trying to make you see what we saw, and feel what we felt.\n\nBut try to picture yourself in the glass ball with us:\n\nAll is profound blackness save for a streak of white, dying about fifty\nfeet away, which is the beam of our searchlight. Twenty feet below is a\nbare floor of flinty lava and broken shell. This is unrelieved by\nsea-weed of any kind, appearing like an imagined fragment of Martian or\nlunar landscape.\n\nThe ball sways idly to the push of some explicable submarine current. It\nis like being in a captive balloon, except that the connecting cable\nextends stiffly upward instead of downward.\n\nThere is a realization, an instinctive _feel_ of awful pressure around\nyou. Logic tells you how you are clamped about, but deeper than logic is\nthe intuition that the glass walls are pressing in on themselves--at the\npoint of collapse. Your ears, tingle with the feel of it: your head\nrings with it.\n\nYou are breathing in through your nose--thin, unsatisfying gulps of air\nthat cause your lungs to labor at their task; and you are exhaling\nthrough, your mouth, with difficulty, into the barrel of the powerful\npump. No bubbles arise from the tiny hole where the used air is forced\ninto the water. The pressure is too enormous for that. Only a thin,\nmilky line marks its escape from the sphere.\n\nIn a ghostly way you see Stanley turning the pump handle. With a handful\nof waste which he has borrowed from the _Rosa's_ engine room, the\nProfessor wipes from the section of wall through which the searchlight\nplays the moisture that constantly collects there. I sit with my hand\nnear the key, peering downward and ahead like an engineer in a\nlocomotive cab, ready to raise the shell or lower it as occasion\nwarrants.\n\nAnd always the suffocating awareness of pressure....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStrange and mystic journey as the tortured glass sphere floated over the\nbottom, following the slow drift of the _Rosa_ far above!\n\nThe finger of light played along the tilted side of a wrecked tramp\nsteamer. There was a crumpled gash in the bow. From this ragged hole\nsuddenly appeared a great, serpentine form....\n\nThe Professor clutched at his camera, pointed it, and clenched his hands\nin a frenzy of disappointment. The serpent shape had disappeared back\ninto the hull. A little later and we had drifted slowly past the wreck.\n\n\"Damn it!\" the Professor snatched away his mouthpiece to exclaim: \"If we\ncould only _stop_.\"\n\nThe bottom changed character shortly after we had passed the hulk. We\nbegan to creep over low, gently rounded mounds.\n\nThese were so regular in form that they were puzzling. About fifty feet\nacross and ten in altitude, they looked artificial in their\nsymmetry--like great saucers set on the ocean floor bottom side up. They\ntook on a dirty black hue as our light struck them, and glowed with a\nfaint phosphorescence as they stretched away into the darkness.\n\nA twelve-foot monstrosity, all toad-like head and eyes, swam into the\nlight beam and bumped blindly against the glass ball. For an instant it\ngoggled crazily at us. The Professor took its picture. It blundered\naway. As it reached the darkness beyond the beam it, too, showed\nphosphorescent. A belt of blue-white spots like the portholes of a\nliner extended down its ugly sides.\n\nAlong the bottom, between the curious mounds, writhed a wormlike thing.\nBut it was too huge to be described as truly wormlike--it was eighteen\nor twenty feet long and a foot thick. It was blood red, almost blunt\nended and patently without eyes.\n\nI took my gaze off it for an instant. When I looked again it had\ndisappeared. I blinked at this seeming miracle and then discovered a\nfoot or so of its tail protruding from under the edge of one of the\nmounds. It was threshing furiously about.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was at this instant that I suddenly found increased difficulty, and\nglanced at Stanley.\n\nHe had stopped pumping and was clutching at the Professor's arm with one\nhand while he pointed down with the other. The Professor motioned him\ntoward the pump, and began to click pictures furiously with the camera\npointed at the nearest mound.\n\nWondering at the urgency of Stanley's gesture and the frantic clicking\nof the camera shutter, I looked more closely at the curious, saucerlike\nhump.\n\nUnder closer inspection something remarkably like a huge, mud-colored\neye was revealed! And as we drifted along, twenty feet away on the\nfarther slope, another appeared!\n\nParalyzed, I stared at the edges of the thing. They were waving almost\nimperceptibly up and down, _creeping_!\n\nThe mounds were living creatures! Acres and acres of them lying\nlethargically on the bottom waiting for something to crawl within range\nof their monstrous edges!\n\nInvoluntarily I pressed the key to raise us. But we had gone only a few\nfeet when the Professor called to me.\n\n\"Down again, Martin. I don't think these things will bother us unless we\nscrape against them. Anyway they can't hurt the shell.\"\n\nI lowered the ball to our former twenty-foot level, and there we swung\njust over the monsters' backs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Professor had said that the giant inverted saucers would probably\nnot bother us if we did not come in contact with them. It soon became\napparent that, in a measure, he was right. The creatures either could\nnot or would not lift their enormous bulks from the sea floor.\n\nA gigantic wriggling thing, all grotesque fringe and tentacles, drifted\ndown into the range of our light. Lower it floated until it hovered just\nabove one of the larger mounds. The Professor got its portrait. At the\nsame instant, as though it had heard the click of the shutter and been\nfrightened by it, the thing dropped another foot--and touched the\nsloping back.\n\nWith the speed of light the inverted saucer became a cup. Like a\nclenching fist, the cup closed over one of the straggling tentacles.\n\nThere followed a tug of war that was all the more ghastly for its\nsoundlessness. The hunted jerked spasmodically to get away from the\nhunter. So wild were its efforts that several times it raised the\nmonster clear of the bottom for a foot or so. But the grim clutch could\nnot be broken.\n\nCloser and closer it was dragged. Then, after a supreme paroxysm, the\ntentacle parted and the prey escaped. The tentacle disappeared into the\nmass of the baffled hunter. It made no attempt to follow the fleeing\ncreature. It slowly relaxed along the bottom and waited for its next\nmeal.\n\nThe unearthly incident gave us fresh confidence, convincing us that the\nmonsters did not move unless they were directly touched. Of course we\ncould not foresee the fatal accident that was going to put us within\nreach of one of the giant saucers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe thought for awhile that these great blobs of cold life were the\nlargest creatures of the depths. It was soon made clear to us how\nmistaken that notion was!\n\nFor a time we gazed spellbound at the nightmare assortment of\ngrotesqueries that gradually assembled around us, attracted no doubt by\nour light. The things were mainly sightless and of indescribable shape.\nMost of them were phosphorescent, and they avoided collisions in a way\nthat suggested that they had some buried sense of light perception.\n\nAs time passed the Professor emptied his camera, refilled it several\ntimes and groaned that he had no more film. Twice as we drifted along I\nraised us to keep us clear of a gradual upward slope of the smooth\nfloor.\n\nStanley removed his mouthpiece long enough to suggest that we go back to\nthe surface: we had been submerged for nearly four hours now. But before\nwe could reply a violent movement was felt.\n\nThe ball rocked and twirled so that we were forced to cling to the\ncircular bench to avoid being thrown to the floor. It was as though a\nhurricane of wind had suddenly penetrated the unruffled depths.\n\n\"Earthquake?\" called Stanley.\n\n\"Don't know,\" answered the Professor. He swung the searchlight in an arc\nand focussed it at length on something that appeared only as a field of\nblurred movement. He wiped the moisture from the wall before the lens,\nand there was revealed to us a sight that makes my heart pound even now\nwhen I recall it to memory.\n\nSomething vast and serpentine had ventured too near the bottom--and had\nbeen caught by the death traps there!\n\nThe creature was a writhing mass of gigantic coils. It was impossible\neven to guess at its length, but its girth was such that the\nmound-shaped monsters that had fastened to it could not entirely\nencircle it.\n\nThere it twined and knotted: a mighty serpent of the deepest ocean,\nsnapping its awful length and threshing its powerful tail in an effort\nto dislodge the giant leeches that were flattened against it. And every\ntime it touched the bottom in its blind frenzy, more of the teeming\ndeathtraps attached themselves to it, crawling over their fellows in an\neffort to find unoccupied areas.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSoon the sea-serpent was a distorted, creeping mass. For one appalling\ninstant its head came into our view....\n\nIt resembled the head of a crocodile, only it was ten times larger and\ncovered with scale like the armor plate of a destroyer. The jaws, wide\nopen and slashing with enormous, needle-shaped teeth at the huge\nparasites, were large enough to have held our glass sphere. One eye\nappeared. It was at least three feet across and of a shimmering amethyst\ncolor.\n\nOne of the deadly saucers wrapped itself around the great head. The\nentire mass of attackers and attacked settled slowly to the bottom.\n\nBut before it completely succumbed the beaten monster gave one last,\nconvulsive flick of its tail....\n\n\"Good God!\" cried Stanley, shrinking away from the pump and staring\nupward.\n\nI followed his gaze with my own eyes.\n\nIn the faint reflected glow of the searchlight I could see row on row of\nlarge cups flattened against the top of the ball. As I watched these\nflattened still more and the big sphere quivered perceptibly.\n\nIn its death struggle the mighty serpent had flicked one of the huge\nleeches against us. It now clung there with blind tenacity, covering\nnearly two-thirds of our shell with the underside of its body.\n\nI reached for the control key to send us to the surface.\n\n\"Don't!\" snapped the Professor. \"The weight--\"\n\nHe needed to say no more. My hand recoiled as though the key had been\nred hot.\n\nThe three-quarter-inch cable above us was now sustaining, in addition to\nits own huge weight, our massive glass ball and the appalling tonnage\nof this grim blanket of flesh that encircled us. Could it further hold\nagainst the strain of lifting that combined tonnage through the press of\nthe water? Almost certainly it could not!\n\nThere was nothing we could do but hang there and discover at first hand\nexactly what happened to things that were clamped in those mighty,\nliving vises!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Professor turned on the interior bulb. The result was ghastly. It\nshowed every detail of the belly of the thing that gripped us.\n\nCrowded over its entire under surface were gristly, flattened suckers.\nNow and then a convulsive ripple ran through its surface tissue and\ngreat ridges of flesh stood out. With each squeeze the glass shell\nquivered ominously as though the extreme limit of its pressure resisting\npower were being reached--and passed.\n\n\"A nice fix,\" remarked the Professor, his calm, dry voice acting like a\ntonic in that moment of fear. \"If we try to go up, the cable would\nprobably break. If we try to outlast the patience of this thing we might\nrun out of air, or actually be staved in.\"\n\nHe paused thoughtfully.\n\n\"I suggest, though, that we follow the latter course for awhile at\nleast. It would be just too bad if that cable broke, gentlemen!\"\n\nStanley shuddered, and looked at the dirty white belly that pressed\nagainst the glass walls on all sides.\n\n\"I vote we stay here for a time.\"\n\n\"And I,\" was my addition.\n\nI relieved Stanley at the pump. He and the Professor sat down on the\nbench. Casting frequent glances at the constricted blanket of flesh that\ncovered us, we prepared to wait as composedly as we might for the thing\nto give up its effort to smash our shell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hour that followed was longer than any full day I have ever lived\nthrough. Had I not confirmed the passage of time by looking at my\nwatch, I would have sworn that at least twenty hours had passed.\n\nEvery half-minute I gazed at that weaving pattern of cup-shaped suckers\nonly five feet away, trying to see if they were relaxing in their\npressure. I attempted to persuade myself that they were. But I knew I\nwas only imagining it. Actually they were pressed as flat as ever, and\nthe sphere still quivered at regular intervals as the heavy body\nsqueezed in on itself. There was no sign that its blind, mindless\npatience was becoming exhausted.\n\nThere was little conversation during that interminable hour.\n\nStanley grinned wryly once and commented on the creature's\ndisappointment if it actually succeeded in getting at us.\n\n\"We'd be scattered all over the surrounding half mile by the pressure of\nthe water,\" he said. \"There'd be nothing left for our pet to feed on but\nfive-foot chunks of broken glass. Not a very satisfying meal.\"\n\n\"We might try to reason with the thing--point out how foolish it is to\nwaste its time on us,\" I suggested, trying to appear as nonchalant as he\nwas.\n\nThe Professor said nothing. He was coolly writing in his notebook,\ndescribing minutely the appearance of our abysmal captor.\n\nFinally I chanced to look down through a section of wall not covered by\nour stubborn enemy. I wiped the moisture from the glass before the\nsearchlight so that I could see more clearly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bottom seemed to be heaving up and down. I blinked my eyes and\nlooked again. It was not an illusion. With a regular dip and rise we\nwere approaching to within a few feet of the rocky floor and moving back\nup again. Also we were floating faster than at anytime previous. The\nbottom was bare again; we had left the crowding, ominous mounds.\n\nI waved to the Professor. He snapped his notebook shut and stared at the\nuneasy ocean bottom.\n\n\"I've been hoping I was wrong,\" he said simply. \"I thought I felt a wavy\nmotion fifteen minutes ago, and it seemed to me to increase steadily.\"\n\nThe three of us stared at each other.\n\n\"You mean ...\" began Stanley with a shudder.\n\n\"I mean that the _Rosa_, one mile above us, is having difficulties. A\nstorm. Judging from our movement it must be a hurricane: the length of\ncable would cushion us from any average wave, and we are rising and\nfalling at least fifteen feet.\"\n\n\"My God!\" groaned Stanley. \"The _Rosa_ is already heeled with the weight\nof us. She could never weather a hurricane!\"\n\nThe plight of the crew above our heads was as clear to us as though we\nhad been aboard with them.\n\nShould they cut the cable, figuring that the lives of the three of us\nwere certainly not to be set against the thirty on the yacht?\n\nShould they disconnect the electric control and try to haul us up\nregardless?\n\nOr should they try to ride out the storm in spite of being crippled by\nthe drag of us?\n\n\"I think if I were up there I'd cut us adrift,\" said Stanley grimly.\nBoth the Professor and myself nodded. \"Though,\" he added hopefully, \"my\ncaptain is a good gambler....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cable quivered like a live thing under the terrific strain. At each\ndownward swoop, before the upswing began, there was a sickening sag.\n\n\"We no longer have a decision to make,\" said the Professor. \"Press the\nkey, Martin, and God grant we can rise with all this dead weight.\"\n\nAnd at that instant the crew of the _Rosa_ were also relieved of the\nnecessity for making a decision.\n\nAt the bottom of one of those long, sickening falls there was a\njerk--and we continued on down to the ocean floor!\n\nThe sphere rolled over, jumbling the equipment in a tangled mess with\nthe three of us in the center, bruised and cut. The light snapped off as\nthe battery connections were torn loose.\n\nThere we lay at the bottom of Penguin Deep, in an inert sphere that was\ndead and dark in the surrounding blackness--a coffin of glass to hold us\nthrough the centuries....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Martin,\" I heard the Professor's voice after a time. \"Stanley--can\neither of you move? I'm caught.\"\n\n\"I'm caught, too,\" came Stanley's gasping answer. \"Something on my\nleg--feels like it's broken.\"\n\nA heavy object was pressing across my body. With an effort I freed\nmyself and fumbled in the pitch darkness for the other two.\n\n\"Lights first,\" commanded the Professor. \"The pump, you know.\"\n\nI did know! Frantically I scrambled in the dark till I located the\nbatteries. They were right side up and still wired together.\n\nThe air grew rapidly foul with no one at the pump. Panting for breath I\nblundered at the task of connecting the light. After what seemed an\neternity I accomplished it.\n\nThe light revealed Stanley with an air tank lying across his leg. The\nmouthpiece of his breathing tube had been forced back over his head,\ngashing his face in its journey. His face was white with pain.\n\nThe Professor was caught under the heavy bench. I freed him and together\nwe attended to Stanley, finding that his leg wasn't broken but only\nbadly bruised.\n\nThe mound-shaped monster, dislodged possibly by the fall, was nowhere to\nbe seen.\n\nI resumed work at the pump, the connections of which were so strongly\ncontrived that they had withstood the shock of the upset.\n\nFor a moment we were content to rest while the air grew purer. Then we\nwere forced squarely to face our fate.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Professor summed up the facts in a few concise words.\n\n\"We're certainly doomed! Here at the bottom of Penguin Deep we're as out\nof reach of help as though we were stranded on the moon. We're as good\nas dead right now.\"\n\n\"If we have nothing left to hope for,\" whispered Stanley after a time,\n\"we might as well close the air valves and get it over with at once. No\nuse torturing ourselves....\"\n\nThe Professor moistened his lips.\n\n\"It might be wise.\" He turned to me. \"What's your opinion, Martin?\"\n\nBut I--I confess I had not the stark courage of these two.\n\n\"No! No!\" I cried out. \"Let's keep on living as long as the air holds\nout. Something might happen--\"\n\nI avoided their eyes as I said it, utterly ashamed of my cowardly\nquibbling with death. What in the name of God could possibly happen to\nhelp us?\n\nThe Professor shrugged dully, and nodded.\n\n\"I feel with Stanley that we ought to get it over in one short stab. But\nwe have no right to force you....\" His voice trailed off.\n\nWe readjusted our mouthpieces. I turned automatically at the pump; and\nwe silently awaited the last suffocating moment of our final doom.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs before, attracted by the light, a strange assortment of deep-sea life\nwriggled and darted about us, swimming lazily among the looped coils and\ntwists of our cable which had settled down around us.\n\nAmong these were certain fish that resembled great porcupines. Spines a\nfoot and a half long, like living knife blades, protected them from the\nattacks of other species.\n\nThey were the only things we saw that were not constantly writhing away\nfrom the jaws of some hostile monster--the only things that seemed able\nto swim about their own affairs without even deigning to watch for\ndanger.\n\nFascinated, I watched the six-foot creatures. Here were we, reasoning\nhumans, supposed lords of creation, slowly but surely perishing--while\nonly a few feet away one of the lowest forms of life could exist in\nperfect safety and tranquility!\n\nThen, as I watched them, I seemed to see a difference in some of them.\n\nThe majority of them had two fins just behind the gill slits, typical\nfish tails and blunt, sloping heads. But now and then I saw a spined\nmonster that was queerly unlike its fellows.\n\nInstead of two front fins, these unique ones had two vacant round holes.\nThe head looked as though it had forgotten to grow; its place was taken\nby an eyeless, projecting, shield shaped cap. And there was no tail.\n\nGlad to find something to distract my half crazed thoughts, I studied\nthe nearest of these.\n\nThey moved slower than their tailed and finned brothers, I noticed. I\nwondered how they could move at all, lacking in any kind of motive power\nas they seemed to be.\n\nNext instant the secret of their movement was made clear!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOut of the empty fin holes of the creature I was studying crept two\nlong, powerful looking tentacles. But these were not true tentacles.\nThere were no vacuum discs on them, and they moved as though supported\nby jointed bones--like arms.\n\nThe arms ended in flat paddles that resembled hands. These threshed the\nwater in a sort of breast-stroke, propelling the body forward.\n\nShortly after the arms had appeared, the spiny head cap was cautiously\nextended a few inches forward from the main shell. Further it was\nextended as the head of a turtle might slowly appear from the protection\nof its bony case. And under it--\n\n\"Professor!\" I screamed wildly. \"My God! Look!\"\n\nBoth the Professor and Stanley merely stared dully at me. I babbled of\nwhat I had seen.\n\n\"A man! A human looking thing, anyway! Arms and a head! A man inside a\nfish's spined hide--like armor!\"\n\nThey looked pityingly at me. The Professor laid his hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"Now, now,\" he soothed, \"don't go to pieces--\"\n\n\"I tell you I saw it!\" I shouted. Then, shrinking from the hysterical\nloudness of my own voice, I lowered my tone. \"Something that looks human\nhas occupied some of those prickly, six-foot shells. I saw arms--and a\nman's head! I swear it!\"\n\n\"Nonsense! How could a human being stand the cold, the pressure--\"\n\nHere I happened to glance at the wall of the shell through which the\nsearchlight shone.\n\n\"Look! See for yourself!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSquarely in the rays of the light showed a head, projecting from one of\nthe shells and capped with a wide flat helmet of horned bone.\n\nThere were eyes and nose and mouth placed on one side of that head--a\nface! There were even tabs of flesh or bony protuberances that resembled\nears.\n\n\"Curious,\" muttered the Professor, staring. \"It certainly looks human\nenough to talk. But it's only a fish, nevertheless. See--in the throat\nare gill slits.\"\n\n\"But the eyes! Look at them! They're not the eyes of a fish!\"\n\nAnd they were not. There was in them a light of reason, of intelligence.\nThose eyes were roaming brightly over us, observing the light, the\nequipment, seeming to note our amazement as we crowded to look at it.\n\nThe sphere rocked slightly. Behind the staring, manlike visitor there\nwas a glimpse of enormous, crocodile jaws and huge, amethyst eyes.\nInstantly the head and arms receded, leaving an empty-seeming, lifeless\nshell. An impregnable fortress of spines, the thing drifted slowly away\nthrough the twisted loops of cable.\n\n\"It certainly looked like--\" began Stanley shakily.\n\n\"The creature was just a fish,\" said the Professor shaking his head at\nthe light in Stanley's eyes. \"Some sort of giant parasite that inhabits\nthe shells of other fish.\"\n\nHe opened the valve of the last air cylinder and seated himself\nresignedly on the bench.\n\n\"We have another half hour or so--\"\n\nAll of us suddenly put out our hands to brace ourselves. The sphere had\nmoved.\n\n\"Look at the cable!\" called Stanley.\n\nWe did so. It was moving, writhing away from us over the bottom as\nthough abruptly given life of its own. Coil after coil disappeared into\nthe further gloom.\n\nAt length the cable was straight. The ball moved again--was dragged a\nfew feet along the rocky floor.\n\nSomething--possessed of incredibly vast power--had seized the end of the\nsteel cable and was reeling us in as a fisherman reels in a trout!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly, unsteadily, we slid along the ocean floor. Ahead of us appeared\na jagged black wall--a cliff. There was a gloomy hole at its base.\nToward this we were being dragged by whatever it was that had caught the\nend of the cable.\n\nHelpless, we watched ourselves engulfed by the murky den. In the beam of\nthe searchlight we saw that the submarine cavern extended on and on for\nan unguessable depth. The cable, taut with the strain, stretched ahead\nout of sight.\n\nTime had been lost track of during that mysterious, ominous journey. It\nwas recalled to us by the state of the air we were breathing.\n\nThe Professor removed his mouthpiece and cast the tube aside.\n\n\"You might as well stop pumping, Martin,\" he said quietly. \"We're done.\nThere's no more air in the flask.\"\n\nWe stared at each other. Then we shook hands, solemnly, tremulously,\ntaking leave of each other before we departed on that longest of all\njourneys....\n\nThe air in that small space was rapidly exhausted. We lay on the floor,\nlaboring for breath, and closed our eyes....\n\nThe Professor, the oldest of the three of us, succumbed first. I heard\nhis breath whistle stertorously and, glancing at him, saw that he was in\na coma. In a moment Stanley had joined him in blessed unconsciousness.\n\nI could feel myself drifting off.... Hammers beat at my ears.... Daggers\npierced my heaving lungs....\n\nHazily I could see scores of the bristly, manlike fish when I opened my\neyes and glanced through the walls. It was not one monster then, but\nmany that had brought us to their lair. Abruptly, as though a signal had\nbeen given, they all streamed back toward the mouth of the cavern....\n\nMy eyesight dimmed.... The hammers pulsed louder.... A veil descended\nover my senses and I knew no more....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA soft, sustained roar came to my ears. Through my closed eyelids I\ncould sense light. A dank, fishy smell came to my nostrils.\n\nI groaned and moved feebly, finding that I was resting on something soft\nand pleasant.\n\nDazedly I opened my eyes and sat up. An exclamation burst from me as I\nsuddenly remembered what had gone before, and realized that somehow,\nincredibly, I was still living.\n\nFeeling like a man who has waked from a nightmarish sleep to find\nhimself in his tomb, I gazed about.\n\nI was in a long, lofty rock chamber, the uneven floor of which was\ncovered with shallow pools of water. The further end was of\nsmooth-grained stone that resembled cement. The near end was rough like\nthe walls; but in it there was a small, symmetrical arch, the mouth of a\npassage leading away to some other point in the bowels of the earth.\n\nThe place was flooded with clear light that had a rosy tinge. From my\nposition on the floor I could not see what made the light. It streamed\nfrom a crevice that extended clear around the cave parallel with the\nfloor and about twelve feet above it. From this groove, along with the\nlight, came the soft roaring hiss.\n\nBeside me was the glass ball, the cover off and lying a few feet away\nfrom the opening in the top. There was no trace of Stanley or the\nProfessor.\n\nI rose from my couch, a thick, mattresslike affair of soft, pliant hide,\nand walked feebly toward the small arch in the near end of the cave.\n\nEven as I approached it I heard footsteps, and voices resounded in some\nslurring, musical language. Half a dozen figures suddenly came into\nview.\n\nThey were men, as human as myself! Indeed, as I gazed at them, I felt\ninclined to think they were even more human!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were magnificent specimens. The smallest could not have been less\nthan six feet three, and all of them were muscular and finely\nproportioned. Their faces were arresting in their expression of calm\nstrength and kindliness. They looked like gods, arrayed in soft, thick,\nbeautifully tanned hides in this rosy tinted hole a mile below the\nocean's top.\n\nThey stared at me for an instant, then advanced toward me. My face must\nhave reflected alarm, for the tallest of them held up his hand, palm\noutward, in a peaceful gesture.\n\nThe leader spoke to me. Of course the slurred, melodious syllable meant\nnothing to me. He smiled and indicated that I was to follow him. I did\nso, hardly aware of what I was doing, my brain reeling in an attempt to\ngrasp the situation.\n\nHow marvelous, how utterly incredible, to find human beings here! How\nmany were there? Where had they come from? How had they salvaged us from\nPenguin Deep? I gave it up, striding along with my towering guards like\na man walking in his sleep.\n\nAt length the low passageway ended, and I exclaimed aloud at what I saw.\n\nI was looking down a long avenue of buildings, all three stories in\nheight. There were large door and window apertures, but no doors nor\nwindow panes. In front of each house was a small square with--wonder of\nwonders!--a lawn of whitish yellow vegetation that resembled grass. In\nsome of the lawns were set artistic fountains of carved rock.\n\nI might have been looking down any prosperous earthly subdivision, save\nfor the fact that the roofs of the houses were the earth itself, which\nthe building walls, in addition to functioning as partitions, served to\nsupport. Also earthly subdivisions aren't usually illuminated with rosy\nlight that comes softly roaring from jets set in the walls.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were walking toward a more brightly lighted area that showed ahead of\nus. On the way we passed intersections where other, similar streets\nbranched geometrically away to right and left. These were smaller than\nthe one we were on, indicating that ours was Main Street in this bizarre\nsubmarine city.\n\nFaces appeared at door and window openings to peer at me as we passed.\nAnd even in that jumbled moment I had time to realize that these folk\ncould restrain curiosity better than we can atop the earth. There was no\nhub-bub, no running out to tag after the queerly dressed foreigner and\nshout humorous remarks at him.\n\nWe approached the bright spot I had noticed from afar. It was an open\nsquare, about a city block in area, in the center of which was a royal\nlooking building covered with blazing fragments of crystal and so\nbrilliantly resplendent with light that it seemed to glow at the heart\nof a pink fire.\n\nI was led toward this and in through a wide doorway. As courteously as\nthough I were a visiting king, I was conducted up a great staircase,\ndown a corridor set with more of the sparkling crystals and into a huge,\nlow room. There my escort bowed and left me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStill feeling that I could not possibly be awake and seeing actual\nthings, I glanced around.\n\nIn a corner was another of the mattresslike couches made of the thick,\nsoft hide that seemed to be the principal fabric of the place. A few\nfeet away was a table set with dishes of food in barbaric profusion.\nNone of the viands looked familiar but all appealed to the appetite. The\nfloor was strewn with soft skins, and comfortable, carved benches were\nscattered about.\n\nI walked to the window and looked out. Underneath was a plot of the\ncream colored grass through which ran a tiny stream. This widened at\nintervals into clear pools beside which were set stone benches. A\nhundred yards away was the edge of the square, where the regular, three\nstoried houses began.\n\nWhile I was staring at this unearthly vista, still unable to think with\nany coherence. I heard my name called. I turned to face Stanley and the\nProfessor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBoth were pale in the rose light, and Stanley limped with the pain of\nhis bruised leg: but both had recovered from their partial suffocation\nas completely as had I.\n\n\"We thought perhaps you'd decided to swim back up to the _Rosa_ and\nleave us to our fates,\" said Stanley after we had stopped pumping each\nother's arms and had seated ourselves.\n\n\"And I thought--well, I didn't think much of anything,\" I replied. \"I\nwas too busy straining my eyesight over the wonders of this city. Did\nyou ever see anything like it?\"\n\n\"We haven't seen it at all, save for a view from the windows,\" said\nStanley. \"All we know of the place is that a while ago we woke up in a\nroom like this, only much smaller and less lavish. I wonder why you rate\nthis distinction?\"\n\nI described the streets as I had seen them. (It is impossible for me to\nthink of them as anything but streets; it would seem as though the rock\nroof over all would give the appearance of a series of tunnels; but I\nhad always the impression of airiness and openness.)\n\n\"Light and heat are furnished by natural gas,\" said the Professor when I\nremarked on the perfection of these two necessities. \"That's what makes\nthe low roaring noise--the thousands of burning jets. But the presence\nof gas here isn't as unusual as the presence of air. Where does that\ncome from? Through wandering underground mazes, from some cave mouth in\nthe Fiji Islands to the north? That would indicate that all the earth\naround here is honeycombed like a gigantic section of sponge. I\nwonder--\"\n\n\"Have you any idea how we were rescued?\" I interrupted, a little\nimpatient of his abstract scientific ponderings.\n\n\"We have,\" said Stanley. \"A woman told us. We woke up to find her\nnursing us--gorgeous looking thing--finest woman I've ever seen, and\nI've seen a good many--\"\n\n\"She didn't exactly 'tell' us,\" remarked the Professor with his thin\nsmile. Women were only interesting to him as biological studies. \"She\ndrew a diagram that explained it.\n\n\"That tunnel, Martin, was like the outer diving chamber of a submarine.\nWe were hauled in on a big windlass--driven by gas turbines, I think.\nOnce we were inside, a twenty-yard, counterbalanced wall of rock was\nlowered across the entrance. Then the water was drained out through a\nwell, and into a subterranean body of water that extends under the\nentire city. And here we are.\"\n\nWe fell silent. Here we were. But what was going to happen to us among\nthese friendly-seeming people; and how--if ever--we were going to get\nback to the earth's surface, were questions we could not even try to\nanswer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe ate of the appetizing food laid out on the long table. Shortly\nafterward we heard steps in the corridor outside the room.\n\nA woman entered. She was ravishingly beautiful, tall, slender but\nsymmetrically rounded. A soft leather robe slanted upward across her\nbreast to a single shoulder fastening and ended just above her knees in\na skirt arrangement. Around her head was a regal circlet of silvery gray\nmetal with a flashing bit of crystal set in the center above her broad,\nlow forehead.\n\nShe smiled at Stanley who looked dazzled and smiled eagerly back.\n\nShe pointed toward the door, signifying that we were to go with her. We\ndid so; and were led down the great staircase and to a huge room that\ntook up half the ground floor of the building. And here we met the\nnobility of the little kingdom--the upper class that governed the\nimmaculate little city.\n\nThey were standing along the walls, leaving a lane down the center of\nthe room--tall, finely modelled men and women dressed in the single\ngarments of soft leather. There were people there with gray hair and\nwisdom wrinkled faces; but all were alike in being erect of body, firm\nof bearing and in splendid health.\n\nThey stopped talking as we entered the big room. Our gaze strayed ahead\ndown the lane toward the further wall.\n\nHere was a raised dais. On it was a gleaming crystal encrusted throne.\nAnd occupying it was the most queenly, exquisitely beautiful woman I\nhad ever dreamed about.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWoman? She was just a girl in years in spite of her grave and royal air.\nHer eyes were deep violet. Her hair was black as ebony and gleaming with\nsudden glints of light. Her skin--\n\nBut she cannot be described. Only a great painter could give a hint of\nher glory. Too, I might truthfully be described as prejudiced about her\nperfections.\n\nThe Queen, for patently she was that, bowed graciously at us. It seemed\nto me--though I told myself that I was an imaginative fool--that her\neyes rested longest on me, and had in them an expression not granted to\nthe Professor or Stanley.\n\nShe spoke to us a melodious sentence or two, and waved her beautiful\nhand in which was a short ivory wand, evidently a scepter.\n\n\"She's probably giving us the keys to the city,\" whispered Stanley. He\nedged nearer the fair one who had conducted us. \"I sincerely hope\nthere's room here for us.\"\n\nThe open lane closed in on us. Men and women crowded about us speaking\nto us and smiling ruefully as they realized we could not understand. I\nnoticed that, for some curious reason, they seemed fascinated by the\ncolor of my hair. Red-haired men were evidently scarce there.\n\nAt length the beauty who had so captured Stanley's fancy, and who seemed\nto have been appointed a sort of mentor for us, suggested in sign\nlanguage that we might want to return to our quarters.\n\nIt was a welcome suggestion. We were done in by the experiences and\nemotions that had gripped us since leaving the _Rosa_ such an incredibly\nfew hours ago.\n\nWe went back to the second floor. I to my luxurious big apartment and\nStanley and the Professor to their smaller but equally comfortable\nrooms.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA pleasant period slid by, every waking hour of which was filled with\nnew experiences.\n\nThe city's name, we found, was Zyobor. It was a perfect little\ncommunity. There were artisans and thinkers, artists and laborers--all\nalike in being physically perfect beyond belief and cultured as no race\non top the ground is cultured.\n\nAs we began to learn the language, more exact details of the practical\nmethods of existence were revealed to us.\n\nThe surrounding earth furnished them with building materials, metals and\nunlimited gas. The sea, so near us and yet so securely walled away, gave\nthem food. Which warrants a more detailed description.\n\nWe were informed that the manlike, two-armed fishes were the servants of\nthese people--domesticated animals, in a sense, only of an extremely\nhigh order of intelligence. They were directed by mental telepathy\n(Every man, woman and child in Zyobor was skilled at thought projection.\nThey conversed constantly, from end to end of the city, by mental\ntelepathy.)\n\nProtected in their spined shells, which they captured from the schools\nof porcupine fish that swarmed in Penguin Deep, they gathered sea\nvegetation from the higher levels and trapped sea creatures. These were\nbrought into the subterranean chamber where our glass ball now reposed.\nThen the chamber was emptied of water and the food was borne to the\ncity.\n\nThe vast army of mound-fish provided the bulk of the population's food,\nand also furnished the thick, pliant skin they used for clothing and\ndrapes. They were cultivated as we cultivate cattle--an ominous herd, to\nbe handled with care and approached by the fish-servants with due\ncaution.\n\nThus, with all reasonable wants satisfied, with talent and brains to\ndesign beautiful surroundings, lighted and warmed by inexhaustible\nnatural gas, these fortunate beings lived their sheltered lives in\ntheir rosy underground world.\n\nAt least I thought their lives were sheltered then. It was only later,\nwhen talking to the beautiful young Queen, that I learned of the dread\nmenace that had begun to draw near to them just a short time before we\nwere rescued....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy first impression, when we had entered the throne room that first day,\nthat the Queen had regarded me more intently than she had Stanley or the\nProfessor, had been right. It pleased her to treat me as an equal, and\nto give me more of her time than was granted to any other person in the\ncity.\n\nEvery day, for a growing number of hours, we were together in her\napartment. She personally instructed me in the language, and such was my\ndesire to talk to this radiant being that I made an apt pupil.\n\nSoon I had progressed enough to converse with her--in a stilted,\nincorrect way--on all but the most abstract of subjects. It was a fine\nlanguage. I liked it, as I liked everything else about Zyobor. The upper\nearth seemed far away and well forgotten.\n\nHer name, I found, was Aga. A beautiful name....\n\n\"How did your kingdom begin?\" I asked her one day, while we were sitting\nbeside one of the small pools in the gardens. We were close together.\nNow and then my shoulder touched hers, and she did not draw away.\n\n\"I know not,\" she replied. \"It is older than any of our ancient records\ncan say. I am the three hundred and eleventh of the present reigning\nline.\"\n\n\"And we are the first to enter thy realm from the upper world?\"\n\n\"Thou art the first.\"\n\n\"There is no other entrance but the sea-way into which we were drawn?\"\n\n\"There is no other entrance.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was silent, trying to realize the finality of my residence here.\n\nAt the moment I didn't care much if I never got home!\n\n\"In the monarchies we know above,\" I said finally, avoiding her violet\neyes, \"it is not the custom for the queen--or king--to reign alone. A\nconsort is chosen. Is it not so here? Has thou not, among thy nobles,\nsome one thou hast destined--\"\n\nI stopped, feeling that if she dismissed me in anger and never spoke to\nme again the punishment would be just.\n\nBut she wasn't angry. A lovely tide of color stained her cheeks. Her\nlips parted, and she turned her head. For a long time she said nothing.\nThen she faced me, with a light in her eyes that sent the blood racing\nin my veins.\n\n\"I have not yet chosen,\" she murmured. \"Mayhap soon I shall tell thee\nwhy.\"\n\nShe rose and hurried back toward the palace. But at the door she\npaused--and smiled at me in a way that had nothing whatever to do with\nqueenship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the time sped by the three of us settled into the routine of the city\nas though we had never known of anything else.\n\nThe Professor spent most of his time down by the sea chamber where the\nfood was dragged in by the intelligent servant-fish.\n\nHe was in a zoologist's paradise. Not a creature that came in there had\never been catalogued before. He wrote reams of notes on the parchment\npaper used by the citizens in recording their transactions. Particularly\nwas he interested in the vast, lowly mound-fish.\n\nOne time, when I happened to be with him, the receding waters of the\nchamber disclosed the body of one of the odd herdsmen of these deep sea\nflocks. Then the Professor's elation knew no bounds. We hurried forward\nto look at it.\n\n\"It is a typical fish,\" puzzled the Professor when we had cut the body\nout of its usurped armor. \"Cold blooded, adapted to the chill and\npressure of the deeps. There are the gills I observed before ... yet it\nlooks very human.\"\n\nIt surely did. There were the jointed arms, and the rudimentary hands.\nIts forehead was domed; and the brain, when dissected, proved much\nlarger than the brain of a true fish. Also its bones were not those of a\nmammal, but the cartilagenous bones of a fish. It was not quite six feet\nlong; just fitted the horny shell.\n\n\"But its intelligence!\" fretted the Professor, glorying in his inability\nto classify this marvelous specimen. \"No fish could ever attain such\nmental development. Evolution working backward from human to reptile and\nthen fish--or a new freak of evolution whereby a fish on a short cut\ntoward becoming human?\" He sighed and gave it up. But more reams of\nnotes were written.\n\n\"Why do you take them?\" I asked. \"No one but yourself will ever see\nthem.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked at me with professorial absent-mindedness.\n\n\"I take them for the fun of it, principally. But perhaps, sometime, we\nmay figure out a way of getting them up. My God! Wouldn't my learned\nbrother scientists be set in an uproar!\"\n\nHe bent to his observations and dissections again, cursing now and then\nat the distortion suffered by the specimens when they were released from\nthe deep sea pressure and swelled and burst in the atmospheric pressure\nin the cave.\n\nStanley was engrossed in a different way. Since the moment he laid eyes\non her, he had belonged to the stately woman who had first nursed him\nback to consciousness. Mayis was her name.\n\nFrom shepherding the three of us around Zyobor and explaining its\nmarvels to us, she had taken to exclusive tutorship of Stanley. And\nStanley fairly ate it up.\n\n\"You, the notorious woman hater,\" I taunted him one time, \"the wary\nbachelor--to fall at last. And for a woman of another world--almost of\nanother planet! I'm amazed!\"\n\n\"I don't know why you should be amazed,\" said he stiffly.\n\n\"You've been telling me ever since I was a kid that women were all\nuseless, all alike--\"\n\n\"I find I was mistaken,\" he interrupted. \"They aren't all alike. There's\nonly one Mayis. She is--different.\"\n\n\"What do you talk about all the time? You're with her constantly.\"\n\n\"I'm not with her any more than you're with the Queen,\" he shot back at\nme. \"What do you find to talk about?\"\n\nThat shut me up. He went to look for Mayis; and I wandered to the royal\napartments in search of Aga.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the first days of our friendship I had several times surprised in\nAga's eyes a curious expression, one that seemed compounded of despair,\nhorror and resignation.\n\nI had seen that same expression in the eyes of the nobles of late, and\nin the faces of all the people I encountered in the streets--who, I\nmustn't forget to add here, never failed to treat me with a deference\nthat was as intoxicating as it was inexplicable.\n\nIt was as though some terrible fate hovered over the populace, some\ndreadful doom about which nothing could be done. No one put into words\nany fears that might confirm that impression; but continually I got the\nidea that everybody there went about in a state of attempting to live\nnormally and happily while life was still left--before some awful,\nwholesale death descended on them.\n\nAt last, from Aga, I learned the fateful reason.\n\nBut first--a confession that was hastened by the knowledge of the fate\nof the city--I learned from her something that changed all of life for\nme.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were surrounded by the luxury of her private apartment. We sat on a\nlow divan, side by side. I wanted, more than anything I had ever wanted\nbefore, to put my arms around her. But I dared not. One does not make\nlove easily to a queen, the three hundred and eleventh of a proud line.\n\nAnd then, as maids have done often in all countries, and, perhaps, on\nall planets, she took the initiative herself.\n\n\"We have a curious custom in Zyobor of which I have not yet told thee,\"\nshe murmured. \"It concerns the kings of Zyobor. The color of their\nhair.\"\n\nShe glanced up at my own carrot-top, and then averted her gaze.\n\n\"For all of our history our kings have had--red hair. On the few\noccasions when the line has been reduced to a lone queen, as in my case,\nthe red-haired men of the kingdom have striven together in public combat\nto determine which was most powerful and brave. The winner became the\nQueen's consort.\"\n\n\"And in this case?\" I asked, my heart beginning to pound madly.\n\n\"In my case, my lord, there is to be no--no striving. When I was a child\nour only two red-haired males died, one by accident, one by sickness.\nNow there are none others but infants, none of eligible age. But--by a\nmiracle--thou--\"\n\nShe stopped; then gazed up at me from under long, gold flecked lashes.\n\n\"I was afraid ... I was doomed to die ... alone....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was after I had replied impetuously to this, that she told me of the\nterror that was about to engulf all life in the beautiful undersea city.\n\n\"Thou hast wonder, perhaps, why I should be forward enough to tell thee\nthis instead of waiting for thine own confession first,\" she faltered.\n\"Know, then--the reason is the shortness of the time we are fated to\nspend together. We shall belong each to the other only a little while.\nThen shall we belong to death! And I--when I knew the time was to be so\nbrief--\"\n\nAnd I listened with growing horror to her account of the enemy that was\nadvancing toward us with every passing moment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout twenty miles away, in the lowest depression of Penguin Deep, lived\na race of monsters which the people of Aga's city called Quabos.\n\nThe Quabos were grim beings that were more intelligent than Aga's\nfish-servants--even, she thought, more intelligent than humans\nthemselves. They had existed in their dark hole, as far as the Zyobites\nknew, from the beginning of time.\n\nThrough the countless centuries they had constructed for themselves a\nvast series of dens in the rock. There they had hidden away from the\ndeep-sea dangers. They, too, preyed on the mound-fish; but as there was\nplenty of food for all, the Zyobites had never paid much attention to\nthem.\n\nBut--just before we had appeared, there had come about a subterranean\nquake that changed the entire complexion of matters in Penguin Deep.\n\nThe earthquake wiped out the elaborately burrowed sea tunnels of the\nQuabos, killing half of them at a blow and driving the rest out into the\nunfriendly openness of the deep.\n\nNow this was fatal to them. They were not used to physical self defense.\nDuring the thousands of years of residence in their sheltered burrows\nthey had become utterly unable to exist when exposed to the primeval\ndangers of the sea. It was as though the civilization-softened citizens\nof New York should suddenly be set down in a howling wilderness with\nnothing but their bare hands with which to contrive all the necessities\nof a living.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuch was the situation at the time Stanley, the Professor and myself\narrived in Zyobor.\n\nThe Quabos must find an immediate haven or perish. On the ocean bottom\nthey were threatened by the mound-fish. In the higher levels they were\nin danger from almost everything that swam: few things were so\ndefenceless as themselves after their long inertia.\n\nTheir answer was Zyobor. There, in perfect security, only to be reached\nby the diving chamber that could be sealed at will by the twenty-yard,\ncounterbalanced lock, the Quabos would be even more protected than in\ntheir former runways.\n\nSo--they were working day and night to invade Aga's city!\n\n\"But Aga,\" I interrupted impulsively at this point. \"If these monsters\nare fishes, how could they live here in air--\"\n\nI stopped as my objection answered itself before she could reply.\n\nThey would not have to live in air to inhabit Zyobor. They would\ninundate the city--flood that peaceful, beautiful place with the awful\npressure of the lowest depths!\n\nThat thought, in turn, suggested to me that every building in Zyobor\nwould be swept flat if subjected suddenly to the rush of the sea. The\ngreat low cavern, without the support of the myriad walls, would\nprobably collapse--trapping the invading Quabos and leaving the rest\nwithout a home once more.\n\nBut Aga answered this before I could voice it.\n\nThe Quabos had foreseen that point. They were tunneling slowly but\nsurely toward the city from a point about half a mile from the diving\nchamber. And as they advanced, they blocked up the passageway behind\nthem at intervals, drilled down to the great underground sea that lay\nbeneath all this section, and drained a little of the water away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn this manner they lightened, bit by bit, the enormous weight of the\nocean depths. When the city was finally reached, not only would it be\nensured against sudden destruction but the Quabos themselves would have\nbecome accustomed to the difference in pressure. Had they gone\nimmediately from the accustomed press of Penguin Deep into the\natmosphere of Zyobor, they would have burst into bits. As it was they\nwould be able to flood the city slowly, without injury to themselves.\n\n\"Now thou knowest our fate,\" concluded Aga with a shudder. \"Zyobor will\nbe a part of the great waters. We ourselves shall be food for these\nmonsters....\" She faltered and stopped.\n\n\"But this cannot be!\" I exclaimed, clenching my fists impotently. \"There\n_must_ be something we can do; some way--\"\n\n\"There is nothing to be done. Our wisest men have set themselves\nsleeplessly to the task of defence. There is no defence possible.\"\n\n\"We can't simply sit here and wait! Your people are wonderful, but this\nis no time for resignation. Send for my two friends, Aga. We will have a\ncouncil of war, we four, and see if we can find a way!\"\n\nShe shrugged despairfully, started to speak, then sent in quest of\nStanley and the Professor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey as well as myself, had had no idea of the menace that crept nearer\nus with each passing hour. They were dumbfounded, horrified to learn of\nthe peril. We sat awhile in silence, realizing our situation to the\nfull.\n\nThen the Professor spoke:\n\n\"If only we could see what these things look like! It might help in\nplanning to defeat them.\"\n\n\"That can be done with ease,\" said Aga. \"Come.\"\n\nWe went with her to the gardens and approached the nearest pool.\n\n\"My fish-men are watching the Quabos constantly. They report to me by\ntelepathy whenever I send my thoughts their way. I will let you see, on\nthe pool, the things they are now seeing.\"\n\nShe stared intently at the sheet of water. And gradually, as we watched,\na picture appeared--a picture that will never fade from my memory in any\nsmallest detail.\n\nThe Quabos had huddled for protection into a large cave at the foot of\nthe cliff outside Zyobor. There were a great many Quabos, and the cave\nwas relatively confining. Now we saw, through the eyes of the spine\nprotected outpost of the Queen, these monstrous refugees crowded\ntogether like sheep.\n\nThe watery cavern was a creeping mass of viscous tentacles, enormous\nstaring eyes and globular heads. The cave was paved three deep with the\nhorrible things, and they were attached to the it walls and roof in\nsolid blocks.\n\n\"My God!\" whispered Stanley. \"There are thousands of them!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were. And that they were in distress was evident.\n\nThe layers on the floor were weaving and shifting constantly as the\nbottom creatures struggled feebly to rise to the top of the mass and be\nrelieved of the weight of their brothers. Also they were famished....\n\nOne of the blood red, gigantic worms floated near the cave entrance.\nLike lightning the nearest Quabos darted after it. In a moment the prey\nwas torn to bits by the ravenous monsters.\n\nThe other side of the story was immediately portrayed to us.\n\nWith the emerging of the reckless Quabos, a sea-serpent appeared from\nabove and snapped up three of their number. Evidently the huge serpent\nconsidered them succulent tidbits, and made it its business to wait near\nthe cave and avail itself of just such rash chance-taking as this.\n\nWhile we watched the nightmare scene, a Quabo disengaged itself from the\nparent mass and floated upward into the clear, giving us a chance to see\nmore distinctly what the creatures looked like.\n\nThere was a black, shiny head as large as a sugar barrel. In this were\neyes the size of dinner plates, and gleaming with a cold, hellish\nintelligence. Four long, twining tentacles were attached directly to\nthe head. Dotted along these were rudimentary sucker discs, that had\nevidently become atrophied by the soft living of thousands of the\ncreature's ancestors.\n\nAs though emerging from the pool into which we were gazing, the monster\ndarted viciously at us. At once it disappeared: the fish-servant through\nwhose eyes we were seeing all this had evidently retreated from the\napproach; although, protected by its spines, it could not have been in\nactual danger.\n\n\"How dost thou know of the tunneling?\" I asked Aga. \"Thy fish-men cannot\nbe present there, in the rear of the tunnel, to report.\"\n\n\"My artisans have knowledge of each forward move,\" she answered. \"I will\nshow thee.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe walked back to the palace and descended to a smooth-lined vault.\nThere we saw a great stone shaft sunk down into the rock of the floor.\nOn this was a delicate vibration recording instrument of some sort, with\na needle that quivered rhythmically over several degrees of an arc.\n\n\"This tells of each move of the Quabos,\" said Aga. \"It also tells us\nwhere they will break through the city wall. How near to us are they,\nKilor?\" she asked an attendant who was studying the dial, and who had\nbowed respectfully to Aga and myself as we approached.\n\n\"They will break into the city in four rixas at the present rate of\nadvance, Your Majesty.\"\n\nFour rixas! In a little over sixteen days, as we count time, the city of\nZyobor would be delivered into the hands--or, rather, tentacles--of the\nslimy, starving demons that huddled in the cavern outside!\n\nSomberly we followed Aga back to her apartment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"As thou seest,\" she murmured, \"there is nothing to be done. We can only\nresign ourselves to the fate that nears us, and enjoy as much as may be\nthe few remaining rixas....\"\n\nShe glanced at me.\n\nThe Professor's dry, cool voice cut across our wordless, engrossed\ncommunion.\n\n\"I don't think we'll give up quite as easily as all that. We can at\nleast try to outwit our enemies. If it does nothing else for us, the\neffort can serve to distract our minds.\"\n\nHe drew from his pocket a sheet of parchment and the stub of his last\nremaining pencil. His fingers busied themselves apparently idly in the\ntracing of geometric lines.\n\n\"Looking ahead to the exact details of our destruction,\" he mused\ncoolly, \"we see that our most direct and ominous enemy is the sea\nitself. When the city is flooded, we drown--and later the Quabos can\nenter at will.\"\n\nHe drew a few more lines, and marked a cross at a point in the outer rim\nof the diagram.\n\n\"What will happen? The Quabos force through the last shell of the city\nwall. The water from their tunnel floods into Zyobor. But--and mark me\nwell--_only_ the water from the tunnel! The outer end, remember, is\nblocked off in their pressure-reducing process. The vast body of the sea\nitself cannot immediately be let in here because the Quabos must take as\nlong a time to re-accustom themselves to its pressure as they did to\nwork out of it.\"\n\nHe spread the parchment sheet before us.\n\n\"Is this a roughly accurate plan of the city?\" he asked Aga.\n\nShe inclined her lovely head.\n\n\"And this,\" indicating the cross, \"is the spot where the Quabos will\nbreak in?\"\n\nAgain she nodded, shuddering.\n\n\"Then tell me what you think of this,\" said the Professor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd he proceeded to sketch out a plan so simple, and yet so seemingly\nefficient, that the rest of us gazed at him with wordless admiration.\n\n\"My friend, my friend,\" whispered Aga at last, \"thou hast saved us.\nThou art the guardian hero of Zyobor--\"\n\n\"Not too fast, Your Highness,\" interrupted the Professor with his frosty\nsmile. \"I shall be much surprised if this little scheme actually saves\nthe city. We may find the rock so thick there that our task is\nhopeless--though I imagine the Quabos picked a thin section for help in\ntheir own plans.\"\n\nA vague look came into his eyes.\n\n\"I must certainly get my hands on one of these monsters ... superhumanly\nintelligent fish ... marvelous--akin to the octopus, perhaps?\"\n\nHe wandered off, changed from the resourceful schemer to the dreamy man\nof scientific abstractions.\n\nThe Queen gazed after him with wonder in her eyes.\n\n\"A great man,\" she murmured, \"but is he--a little mad?\"\n\n\"No, only a little absent-minded,\" I replied. Then, \"Come on, Stanley.\nWe'll round up every able bodied citizen in Zyobor and get to work. I\nsuppose they have some kind of rock drilling machinery here?\"\n\nThey had. And they strangely resembled our own rock drills: revolving\nmetal shafts, driven by gas turbines, tipped with fragments of the same\ncrystal that glittered so profusely in the palace walls. Another proof\nthat practically every basic, badly needed tool had been invented again\nand again, in all lands and times, as the necessity for it arose.\n\nWith hundreds of the powerful men of Zyobor working as closely together\nas they could without cramping each others movements, and with the whole\ncity resounding to the roar of the machinery, we labored at the defence\nthat might possibly check the advance of the hideous Quabos.\n\nAnd with every breath we drew, waking or sleeping, we realized that the\ncold blooded, inhuman invaders had crept a fraction of an inch closer in\ntheir tunneling.\n\nThe Quabos against the Zyobites! Fish against man! Two diametrically\nopposed species of life in a struggle to the death! Which of us would\nsurvive?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hour of the struggle approached. Every soul in Zyobor moved in a\ndaze, with strained face and fear haunted eyes. Their proficiency in\nmental telepathy was a curse to them now: every one carried constantly,\ntransmitted from the brains of the servant-fish outposts, a thought\npicture of that outer cavern in the murky depths of which writhed the\nthousands of crowding Quabos. Each mind in Zyobor was in continual\ntorment.\n\nSpared that trouble, at least, Stanley and the Professor and I walked\ndown to the fortification we had so hastily contrived. It was finished.\nAnd none too soon: the vibration indicator in the palace vault told us\nthat only two feet of rock separated us from the burrowing monsters!\n\nThe Professor's scheme had been to cut a long slot down through the rock\nfloor of the city to the roof of the vast, mysterious body of water\nbelow.\n\nThis slot was placed directly in front of the spot in the city wall\nwhere the Quabos were about to emerge. As they forced through the last\nshell of rock, the deluge of water, instead of drowning the city, was\nsupposed to drain down the oblong vent. Any Quabos that were too near\nthe tunnel entrance would be swept down too.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn silence we approached the edge of the great trough and stared down.\n\nThere was a stratum of black granite, fortunately only about thirty feet\nthick at this point, and then--the depths! A low roar reached our ears\nfrom far, far beneath us. A steady blast of ice cold air fanned up\nagainst us.\n\nThe Professor threw down a large fragment of rock. Seconds elapsed and\nwe heard no splash. The unseen surface was too far below for the noise\nof the rock's fall to carry on up to us.\n\n\"The mystery of this ball of earth on which we live!\" murmured the\nProfessor. \"Here is this enormous underground body of water. We are far\nbelow sea level. Where, then, is it flowing? What does it empty into?\nCan it be that our planet is honeycombed with such hollows as this we\nare in? And is each inhabited by some form of life?\"\n\nHe sighed and shook his head.\n\n\"The thought is too big! For, if that were true, wouldn't the seas be\ndrained from the surface of the earth should an accidental passage be\nformed from the ocean bed down to such a giant river as this beneath us?\nHow little we know!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe wild clamor of an alarm bell interrupted his musing. From all the\ncity houses poured masses of people, to form in solid lines behind the\nlarge well.\n\nIn addition to men, there were many women in those lines, tall and\nstrong, ready to stand by their mates as long as life was left them.\nThere were children, too, scarcely in their teens, prepared to fight for\nthe existence of the race. Every able-bodied Zyobite was mustered\nagainst the cold-blooded Things that pressed so near.\n\nThe arms of these desperate fighters were pitiful compared to our own\nwar weapons. With no need in the city for fighting engines, none had\never been developed. Now the best that could be had was a sort of ax,\nused for dissecting the mound-fish, and various knives fashioned for\npeaceful purposes.\n\nAgain the bell clamored forth a warning, this time twice repeated. Every\nhand grasped its weapon. Every eye went hopefully to the hole in the\nfloor on which our immediate fate depended, then valiantly to the\nsection of wall above it.\n\nThis quivered perceptibly. A heavy, pointed instrument broke through;\nwas withdrawn; and a hissing stream of water spurted out.\n\nThe Quabos were about to break in upon us!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith a crash that made the solid rock tremble, a section of the wall\ncollapsed. It was the top half of the end of the Quabos' tunnel. They\nhad so wrought that the lower half stayed in place--a thing we did not\nhave time to recognize as significant until later.\n\nA solid wall of water, in which writhed dozens of tentacled monsters,\nwas upon us, and we had time for nothing but action.\n\nThe ditch had of necessity been placed directly under the Quabos'\nentrance. The first rush of water carried half over it. With it were\nborne scores of the cold-blooded invaders.\n\nIn an instant we were standing knee deep in a torrent that tore at our\nfooting, while we hacked frantically with knives and axes at the slimy\ntentacles that reached up to drag us under.\n\nA soft, horrible mass swept against my legs. I was overthrown. A\ntentacle slithered around my neck and constricted viciously like a\nlength of rotten cable. I sawed at it with the long, notched blade I\ncarried. Choking for air, I felt the pressure relax and scrambled to my\nknees.\n\nTwo more tentacles went around me, one winding about my legs and the\nother crushing my waist. Two huge eyes glared fiendishly at me.\n\nI plunged the knife again and again into the barrel-shaped head. It did\nnot bleed: a few drops of thin, yellowish liquid oozed from the wounds\nbut aside from this my slashing seemed to make no impression.\n\nIn a frenzy I defended myself against the nightmare head that was\nwinding surely toward me. Meanwhile I devoted every energy to keeping on\nmy feet. If I ever went under again--\n\nIt seemed to me that the creature was weakening. With redoubled fury I\nhacked at the spidery shape. And gradually, when it seemed as though I\ncould not withstand its weight and crushing tentacles another second,\nit slipped away and floated off on the shallow, roaring rapids.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment I stood there, catching my breath and regaining my\nstrength. Shifting, terrible scenes flashed before my eyes.\n\nA tall Zyobite and an almost equally stalwart woman were both caught by\none gigantic Quabo which had a tentacle around the throat of each. The\nman and woman were chopping at the viscous, gruesome head. One of the\nThing's eyes was gashed across, giving it a fearsome, blind appearance.\nIt heaved convulsively, and the three struggling figures toppled into\nthe water and were swirled away.\n\nThe Professor was almost buried by a Quabo that had all four of its\ntentacles wound about him. As methodically as though he were in a\nlaboratory dissecting room, he was cutting the slippery lengths away,\none by one, till the fourth parted and left him free.\n\nA giant Zyobite was struggling with two of the monsters. He had an ax in\neach hand, and was whirling them with such strength and rapidity that\nthey formed flashing circles of light over his head. But he was torn\ndown at last and borne off by the almost undiminished flood that gushed\nfrom the tunnel.\n\nAnd now, without warning, a heavy soft body flung against my back, and\nthe accident most to be dreaded in that m\u00eal\u00e9e occurred.\n\nI was knocked off my feet! My head was pressed under the water. On my\nchest was a mass that was yielding but immovable, soft but terribly\nstrong. Animated, firm jelly! I had no chance to use my knife. My arms\nwere held powerless against my sides.\n\nWater filled my nose and mouth. I strangled for breath, heaving at the\nimplacable weight that pinned me helpless. Bright spots swirled before\nmy eyes. There was a roaring in my ears. My lungs felt as though filled\nwith molten lead. I was drowning....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVaguely I felt the pressure loosen at last. An arm--with good, solid\nflesh and bone in it--slipped under my shoulders and dragged me up into\nthe air.\n\n\"Don't you know--can't drown a fish--holding it under water?\" panted a\nvoice.\n\nI opened my eyes and saw Stanley, his face pale with the thrill of\nbattle, his chin jutting forward in a berserk line, his eyes snapping\nwith eager, wary fires.\n\nI grinned up at him and he slapped me on the back--almost completing the\nchoking process started by the salt water I'd inhaled.\n\n\"That's better. Now--at it again!\"\n\nI don't remember the rest of the tumult. The air seemed filled with\nloathsome tentacles and bright metal blades. It was a confused eternity\nuntil the decreased volume of water in the tunnel gave us a respite....\n\nAs the tunnel slowly emptied the pressure dropped, and the incoming\nflood poured squarely into the trough instead of half over it. From that\nmoment there was very little more for us to do.\n\nOur little army--with about a fourth of its number gone--had only to\nguard the ditch and see that none of the Quabos caught the edges as they\nhurtled out of their passage.\n\nFor perhaps ten minutes longer the water poured from the break in the\nwall, with now and then a doomed Quabo that goggled horribly at us as it\nwas dashed down the hole in the floor to whatever awesome depths were\nbeneath.\n\nThen the flow ceased. The last oleaginous corpse was pushed over the\nedge. And the city, save for an ankle-deep sheet of water that was\nrapidly draining out the vents in the streets, presented its former\nappearance.\n\nThe Zyobites leaned wearily against convenient walls and began telling\nthemselves how fortunate they were to have been spared what seemed\ncertain destruction.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Professor didn't share in the general feeling of triumph.\n\n\"Don't be so childishly optimistic!\" he snapped as I began to\ncongratulate him on the victory his ditch had given us. \"Our troubles\naren't over yet!\"\n\n\"But we've proved that we can stand up to them in a hand-to-tentacle\nfight--\"\n\nHis thin, frosty smile appeared.\n\n\"One of those devils, normally, is stronger than any three men. The only\nreason all of us weren't destroyed at once is that they were slowly\nsuffocating as they fought. The foot and a half of water we were in\nwasn't enough to let their gills function properly. Now if they were\nable to stand right up to us and not be handicapped by lack of water to\nbreathe ... I wonder.... Is that part of their plan? Is there any way\nthey could manage ...?\"\n\n\"But, Professor,\" I argued, \"it's all over, isn't it? The tunnel is\nemptied, and all the Quabos are--\"\n\n\"The tunnel isn't emptied. It's only _half_ emptied! I'll show you.\"\n\nHe called Stanley; and the three of us went to the break.\n\n\"See,\" the Professor pointed out to us as we approached the jagged hole,\n\"the Quabos only drilled through the top half of their tunnel ending.\nThat means that the tunnel still has about four feet of water in\nit--enough to accommodate a great many of the monsters. There may be\nfour or five hundred of them left in there; possibly more. We can expect\nrenewed hostilities at any time!\"\n\n\"But won't it be just a repetition of the first battle?\" remonstrated\nStanley. \"In the end they'll be killed or will drown for lack of water\nas these first ones did.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Professor shook his head.\n\n\"They're too clever to do that twice. The very fact that they kept half\ntheir number in reserve shows that they have some new trick to try.\nOtherwise they'd all have come at once in one supreme effort.\"\n\nHe paced back and forth.\n\n\"They're ingenious, intelligent. They're fighting for their very\nexistence. They must have figured out some way of breathing in air, some\nway of attacking us on a more even basis in case that first rush went\nwrong. What can it be?\"\n\n\"I think you're borrowing trouble before it is necessary--\" I began,\nsmiling at his elaborate, scientific pessimism. But I was interrupted by\na startled shout from Stanley.\n\n\"Professor Martin,\" he cried, pointing to the tunnel mouth. \"Look!\"\n\nLike twin snakes crawling up to sun themselves, two tentacles had\nappeared over the rock rim. They hooked over the edge; and leisurely,\nwith grim surety of invulnerability, the barrel-like head of a Quabo\nbalanced itself on the ledge and glared at us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment we stared, paralyzed, at the Thing. And, during that moment\nit squatted there, as undistressed as though the air were its natural\nelement, its gills flapping slowly up and down supplying it with oxygen.\n\nThe thing that held us rooted to the spot with fearful amazement was the\nfantastic device that permitted it to be almost as much at home in air\nas in water.\n\nOver the great, globular head was set an oval glass shell. This was\nfilled with water. A flexible metal tube hung down from the rear.\nEvidently it carried a constant stream of fresh water. As we gazed we\nsaw intermittent trickles emerging from the bottom of the crystalline\ncase.\n\nPoint for point the creature's equipment was the same as diving\nequipment used by men, only it was exactly opposite in function. A\nhelmet that enabled a fish to breathe in air, instead of a helmet to\nallow a man to breathe in water!\n\nStanley was the first of us to recover from the shock of this spectacle.\nHe faced about and raised his voice in shouts of warning to the resting\nZyobites. For other glass encased monsters had appeared beside the\nfirst, now.\n\nOne by one, in single file like a line of enormous marching insects,\nthey crawled down the wall and humped along on their tentacles--around\nthe ditch and toward us!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe deadly infallibility of that second attack!\n\nThe Quabos advanced on us like armored tanks bearing down on defenceless\nsavages. Their glass helmets, in addition to containing water for their\nbreathing, protected them from our knives and axes. We were utterly\nhelpless against them.\n\nThey marched in ranks about twenty yards apart, each rank helping the\none in front to carry the cumbersome water-hoses which trailed back to\nthe central water supply in the tunnel.\n\nTheir movements were slow, weighted down as they were by the great glass\nhelmets, but they were appallingly sure.\n\nWe could not even retard their advance, let alone stop it. Here were no\nsuffocating, faltering creatures. Here were beings possessed of their\nfull vigor, each one equal to three of us even as the Professor had\nconjectured. Their only weak points were their tentacles which trailed\noutside the glass cases. But these they kept coiled close, so that to\nreach them and hack at them we had to step within range of their\nterrific clutches.\n\nThe Zyobites fought with the valor of despair added to their inherent\nnoble bravery. Man after man closed with the monstrous, armored\nThings--only to be seized and crushed by the weaving tentacles.\n\nOccasionally a terrific blow with an ax would crack one of the glass\nhelmets. Then the denuded Quabo would flounder convulsively in the air\ntill it drowned. But there were all too few of these individual\nvictories. The main body of the Quabos, rank on rank, dragging their\nwater-hose behind them, came on with the steadiness of a machine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly we were driven back down the broad street and toward the palace.\nAs we retreated, old people and children came from the houses and went\nwith us, leaving their dwellings to the mercy of the monsters.\n\nA block from the palace we bunched together and, by sheer mass and\nferocity, actually stopped the machinelike advance for a few moments.\nMiscellaneous weapons had been brought from the houses--sledges, stone\nbenches, anything that might break the Quabos' helmets--and handed to us\nin silence by the noncombatants.\n\nSomebody tugged at my sleeve. Looking down I saw a little girl. She had\ndragged a heavy metal bar out to the fray and was trying to get some\nfighter's attention and give it to him.\n\nI seized the formidable weapon and jumped at the nearest Quabo, a\nten-foot giant whose eyes were glinting gigantically at me through the\ndistorting curve of the glass.\n\nDisregarding the clutching tentacles entirely, I swung the bar against\nthe helmet. It cracked. I swung again and it fell in fragments, spilling\nthe gallons of water it had contained.\n\nThe tentacles wound vengefully around me, but in a few seconds they\nrelaxed as the thing gasped out its life in the air.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI turned to repeat the process on another if I could, and found myself\nfacing the Queen. Her head was held bravely high, though the violet of\nher eyes had gone almost black with fear and repulsion of the terrible\nthings we fought.\n\n\"Aga!\" I cried. \"Why art thou here! Go back to the palace at once!\"\n\n\"I came to fight beside thee,\" she answered composedly, though her\ndelicate lips quivered. \"All is lost, it seems. So shall I die beside\nthee.\"\n\nI started to reply, to urge her again to seek the safety of the palace.\nBut by now the deadly advance of the tentacled demons had begun once\nmore.\n\nFighting vainly, the population of Zyobor was swept into the palace\ngrounds, then into the building itself.\n\nMen, women and children huddled shoulder to shoulder in the cramping\nquarters. An ironic picture came to me of the crowding masses of Quabos\nstuffed into the protection of the outer cave, waiting the outcome of\nthe fight being waged by their warriors. Here were we in a similar\ncircumstance, waiting for the battle to be decided. Though there was\nlittle doubt in the minds of any of us as to what the outcome would be.\n\nGuards, the strongest men of the city, were stationed with sledges at\nthe doors and windows. The Quabos, able only to enter one at a time,\nhalted a moment and there was a badly needed breathing spell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We've got to find some drastic means of defence,\" said the Professor,\n\"or we won't last another three hours.\"\n\n\"If you asked me, I'd say we couldn't last another three hours anyway,\"\nreplied Stanley with a shrug. \"These fish have out-thought us!\"\n\n\"Nonsense! There may still be a way--\"\n\n\"A brace of machine-guns....\" I murmured hopefully.\n\n\"You might as well wish for a dozen light cannon!\" snapped the\nProfessor. \"Please try to concentrate, and see if any effective weapon\nsuggests itself to you--something more available at the moment than\nmachine-guns.\"\n\nIn silence the three of us racked our brains for a means of defence.\nAga, leaving for a time the task of soothing her more hysterical\nsubjects, came quietly over to us and sat on the bench beside me.\n\nFrankly I could think of nothing. To my mind we were surely doomed. What\narms could possibly be contrived at such short notice? What weapon\ncould be called forth to be effective against the thick glass helmets?\n\nBut as I glanced at Stanley I saw his face set in a new expression as\nhis thoughts took a turn that suggested possible salvation.\n\n\"Glass,\" he muttered. \"Glass. What destroys it? Sharp blows ... certain\nacids ... variation in temperature ... heat and cold.... That's it!\n_That's it!_\"\n\nHe turned excitedly to the Queen.\n\n\"I think we have it! At least it's worth trying. If there is any tubing\naround....\" He stopped as he realized he was talking in English, and\nresumed stiltedly in Aga's own language.\n\n\"Hast thou, in the palace, any lengths of pipe like to that which the\nQuabos drag behind them?\"\n\n\"No ...\" Aga began, her eyes round and wondering. Then she interrupted\nherself. \"Ah, yes! There is! In a vault near that of Kilor's there is a\ngreat spool of it. He had it fashioned to carry air for one of his\nexperiments--\"\n\n\"Come along!\" cried Stanley. \"I'll explain what I have in mind while we\ndig up this coil of hose.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA score of Zyobite workmen were gathered at once. The length of\nhose--made of some linen-like fabric of tough, shredded sea-weed and\ncovered with a flexible metal sheath--was cut into three pieces each\nabout fifty yards long. These were connected to three of the largest gas\nvents of the palace.\n\nStanley, the Professor and I each took an end. And we prepared to fight,\nwith fire, the creatures of water.\n\n\"It ought to work,\" Stanley, repeated several times as though trying to\nreassure himself as well as us. \"It's simple enough: the water in those\nhelmets is ice cold: if fire is suddenly squirted against them they'll\ncrack with the uneven expansion.\"\n\n\"Unless,\" retorted the Professor, \"their glass has some special heat and\ncold resisting quality.\"\n\nStanley shrugged.\n\n\"It may well have some such properties. How such creatures can make\nglass at all is beyond me!\"\n\nDragging our hose to the big front entrance of the palace, and warning\nthe crowded people to keep their feet clear of it, we prepared to test\nout the efficiency of this, our last resource against the enemy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor an instant we paused just inside the doorway, looking out at the\nugly, glassed-in Things that were massing to attack us again.\n\nThe ranks of Quabos had closed in now, till they extended down the\nstreet for several hundred yards in close formation--a forest of great\npulpy heads with huge eyes that glared unblinkingly at the glittering,\npink building that was their objective.\n\n\"Light up!\" ordered Stanley, setting an example by touching his hose\nnozzle to the nearest wall jet. A spurt of fire belched from his hose,\nstreaming out for four or five feet in a solid red cone. The Professor\nand I touched off our torches; and we moved slowly out the door toward\nthe ranks of Quabos.\n\n\"Don't try to save yourselves from their tentacles,\" advised Stanley.\n\"Walk right up to them, direct the fire against their helmets, and damn\nthe consequences. If they grip too hard you can always play the torch on\ntheir tentacles till they think better of it.\"\n\nThe Quabos' front line humped grimly toward us, unblinking eyes glaring,\ntentacles writhing warily, little spurts of used water trickling from\ntheir helmets.\n\n\"Keep together,\" warned Stanley, \"so that if any one of us loses his\nlight he can get it from the hose of one of the other two. And--_Here\nthey come!_\"\n\nThere was no more time for commands. The Quabos in front, supplied with\nslack in their hoses by those behind, leaped at us with incredible\nagility. We fell back a step so that none should get at our backs.\n\nThe last stand was begun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was not a battle so much as a series of fierce duels. The Quabos\nrealized their new danger instantly, and devoted all their efforts to\nextinguishing our torches. We parried and thrust with the flaming hoses\nin an equally desperate effort to prevent it.\n\nOne of them scuttled toward me like a great crab. A tentacle darted\ntoward my right arm. Another was pressed against the nozzle. There was a\nsickening smell--and the tentacle was jerked spasmodically away.\n\nI caught the hose in my left hand and turned the fiery jet against the\nwater-filled helmet.\n\nA shout of savage exultation broke from my lips. Hardly, had the flame\ntouched the glass before it cracked! There was a report like a pistol\nshot--and a miniature Niagara of water and splintered glass poured at my\nfeet!\n\nThe tentacle around my arm tightened, then relaxed. The monster\nshuddered in a convulsive heap on the ground.\n\nI went toward the next one, swinging the flaring hose in a slow arc as I\nadvanced. The creature lunged at me and threshed at the burning jet with\nall four of its feelers. But it had been exposed to the air for a long\ntime now. The ghastly tentacles were dry; withered and soft. A touch of\nthe fire seared them unmercifully.\n\nNevertheless with a swift move it slapped a tentacle squarely down over\nthe hose nozzle. The flame was extinguished as the flame of a candle is\npinched out between thumb and forefinger. I retreated.\n\n\"Catch!\" came a voice behind me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Professor swung his four-foot jet my way. I held my hose to it, and\nthe flame burst out again. A touch at my grisly antagonist's helmet--a\nsharp crack--the welcome rush of water over the cream-colored grass--and\nanother monster was writhing in the death throes!\n\nKeeping close together, the three of us faced the massed Quabos in the\npalace grounds. Again and again the fiery weapon of one or the other of\nus was dashed out--to be re-lighted from the nearest hose. Again and\nagain loud detonations heralded the collapse of more of the invaders.\n\nBut it seemed as though their flailing tentacles were as myriad as the\nstars they had never seen. It seemed as though their numbers would never\nappreciably diminish. We thrust and parried till our arms grew numb. And\nstill there appeared to be hundreds of the Quabos left.\n\nBy order of the Queen three stout Zyobites stepped up to us and relieved\nus of our exhausting labor. Gladly we handed the hoses to them and went\nto the palace for a much needed rest.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo more shifts of fighters took the flaming jets before the monsters\nbegan the retreat slowly back toward their tunnel. And here the\nProfessor took command again.\n\n\"We mustn't let them get away to try some new scheme!\" he snapped.\n\"Martin, take fifty men and beat them back to the break in the wall. Go\naround a side street. They move so slowly that you can easily cut off\ntheir retreat.\"\n\n\"There isn't any more hose--\" began Stanley.\n\n\"There's plenty of it. The Quabos brought it with them.\" The Professor\nturned to me again. \"Take metal-saws with you. Cut sections of the\nQuabos water-hose and connect them to the nearest wall jets. Run!\"\n\nI ran, with fifty of the men of Zyobor close behind me. We dodged out\nthe side of the palace grounds least guarded by the Quabos, ducking\nbetween their ranks like infantry men threading through an opposition of\npowerful but slow-moving tanks. Four of our number were caught, but the\nrest got through unscathed.\n\nDown a side street we raced, and along a parallel avenue toward the\ntunnel. As we went I prayed that all the Quabos had centered their\nattention on the palace and left their vulnerable water-hoses unguarded.\n\nThey had! When we stole up the last block toward the break we found the\nnearest Quabo was a hundred yards down the street--and working further\naway with every move.\n\nAt once we set to work on the scores of hoses that quivered over the\nfloor with each move of the distant monsters.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA Zyobite with the muscles of a Hercules swung his ax mightily down on a\nhose. The metal was soft enough to be sheered through by the stroke. The\ncut ends were smashed so that they could not be crammed down over the\ntapering jets; but we could use our metal-saws for cleaner severances at\nthe other ends.\n\nThe giant with the ax stepped from hose to hose. Lengths were completed\nwith the saws. A man was placed at each jet to hold the connections in\nposition. Before the Quabos had reached us we had rigged six fire-hoses\nand had cut through forty or fifty more water-lines.\n\nThe end was certain and not long in coming.\n\nWe sprayed the monsters with fire as workmen spray fruit trees with\ninsect poison. Stanley, the Professor and a Zyobite came up in the rear\nwith their three hoses.\n\nCaught between the two forces, the beaten fish milled in hopeless\nconfusion and indecision.\n\nIn half an hour they were all reduced to huddles of slimy wet flesh that\ndotted the pavement from the break back to the palace grounds. The\ninvaders were completely annihilated--and the city of Zyobor was saved!\n\n\"Now,\" said the Professor triumphantly, \"we have only to knock out the\nbottom half of the tunnel wall, empty the tunnel and make sure there are\nno more Quabos lurking there. After that we can fill it in with solid\ncement. The Queen can order her fish-servants to guard the outer cave\nand see that no food gets in to the starving monsters there. The war is\nover, gentlemen. The Quabos are as good as exterminated at this moment.\nAnd I can get back to my zoological work....\"\n\nStanley and I looked at each other. We knew each others thoughts well\nenough.\n\nHe could resume his companionship with the beautiful Mayis. And I--I had\nAga....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the menace of the Quabos banished forever, the city of Zyobor\nresumed its normal way.\n\nThe citizens lowered their dead into the great well we had cut, with\nappropriate rites performed by the Queen. The daily tasks and pleasures\nwere picked up where they had been dropped. The haunting fear died from\nthe eyes of the people.\n\nShortly afterward, with great ceremony and celebration, I was made King\nof Zyobor, to rule by Aga's side. Stanley took Mayis for his wife. He is\nsecond to me in power. The Professor is the official wise man of the\ncity.\n\nLife flows smoothly for us in this pink lighted community. We are more\nthan content with our lot here. Our only concern has been the grief that\nmust have been occasioned our relatives and friends when the _Rosa_\nsailed home without us.\n\nNow we have thought of a way in which, with luck, we may communicate\nwith the upper world. By relays of my Queen's fish-servants we believe\nwe can send up the Professor's invaluable notes[A] and this informal\naccount of what has happened since we left San Francisco that....\n\n     (Editor's note: There was no trace of any \"notes.\" The yacht,\n     _Rosa_, was reported lost with all hands in a hurricane off New\n     Zealand. Aboard her were a Professor George Berry and the owner,\n     Stanley Browne. There is no record, however, of any passenger by\n     the name of Martin Grey. To date no one has taken this document\n     seriously enough to consider financing an expedition of\n     investigation to Penguin Deep.)\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: _\"When I am finished, Dale, I shall probably kill you.\"_]\n\nThe Murder Machine\n\n_By Hugh B. Cave_\n\n\n[Sidenote: Four lives lay helpless before the murder machine, the\nuncanny device by which hypnotic thought-waves are filtered through\nmen's minds to mold them into murdering tools!]\n\nIt was dusk, on the evening of December 7, 1906, when I first\nencountered Sir John Harmon. At the moment of his entrance I was\nstanding over the table in my study, a lighted match in my cupped hands\nand a pipe between my teeth. The pipe was never lit.\n\nI heard the lower door slam shut with a violent clatter. The stairs\nresounded to a series of unsteady footbeats, and the door of my study\nwas flung back. In the opening, staring at me with quiet dignity, stood\na young, careless fellow, about five feet ten in height and decidedly\ndark of complexion. The swagger of his entrance branded him as an\nadventurer. The ghastly pallor of his face, which was almost colorless,\nbranded him as a man who has found something more than mere adventure.\n\n\"Doctor Dale?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I am Doctor Dale.\"\n\nHe closed the door of the room deliberately, advancing toward me with\nslow steps.\n\n\"My name is John Harmon--Sir John Harmon. It is unusual, I suppose,\" he\nsaid quietly, with a slight shrug, \"coming at this late hour. I won't\nkeep you long.\"\n\nHe faced me silently. A single glance at those strained features\nconvinced me of the reason for his coming. Only one thing can bring such\na furtive, restless stare to a man's eyes. Only one thing--fear.\n\n\"I've come to you. Dale, because--\" Sir John's fingers closed heavily\nover the edge of the table--\"because I am on the verge of going mad.\"\n\n\"From fear?\"\n\n\"From fear, yes. I suppose it is easy to discover. A single look at\nme....\"\n\n\"A single look at you,\" I said simply, \"would convince any man that you\nare deadly afraid of something. Do you mind telling me just what it is?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe shook his head slowly. The swagger of the poise was gone; he stood\nupright now with a positive effort, as if the realization of his\nposition had suddenly surged over him.\n\n\"I do not know,\" he said quietly. \"It is a childish fear--fear of the\ndark, you may call it. The cause does not matter; but if something does\nnot take this unholy terror away, the effect will be madness.\"\n\nI watched him in silence for a moment, studying the shrunken outline of\nhis face and the unsteady gleam of his narrowed eyes. I had seen this\nman before. All London had seen him. His face was constantly appearing\nin the sporting pages, a swaggering member of the upper set--a man who\nhad been engaged to nearly every beautiful woman in the country--who\nsought adventure in sport and in night life, merely for the sake of\nliving at top speed. And here he stood before me, whitened by fear, the\nvery thing he had so deliberately laughed at!\n\n\"Dale,\" he said slowly, \"for the past week I have been thinking things\nthat I do not want to think and doing things completely against my will.\nSome outside power--God knows what it is--is controlling my very\nexistence.\"\n\nHe stared at me, and leaned closer across the table.\n\n\"Last night, some time before midnight,\" he told me, \"I was sitting\nalone in my den. Alone, mind you--not a soul was in the house with me.\nI was reading a novel; and suddenly, as if a living presence had stood\nin the room and commanded me, I was forced to put the book down. I\nfought against it, fought to remain in that room and go on reading. And\nI failed.\"\n\n\"Failed?\" My reply was a single word of wonder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I left my home: because I could not help myself. Have you ever been\nunder hypnotism, Dale? Yes? Well, the thing that gripped me was\nsomething similar--except that no living person came near me in order to\nwork his hypnotic spell. I went alone, the whole way. Through back\nstreets, alleys, filthy dooryards--never once striking a main\nthoroughfare--until I had crossed the entire city and reached the west\nside of the square. And there, before a big gray town-house, I was\nallowed to stop my mad wandering. The power, whatever it was, broke.\nI--well, I went home.\"\n\nSir John got to his feet with an effort, and stood over me.\n\n\"Dale,\" he whispered hoarsely, \"what was it?\"\n\n\"You were conscious of every detail?\" I asked. \"Conscious of the time,\nof the locality you went to? You are sure it was not some fantastic\ndream?\"\n\n\"Dream! Is it a dream to have some damnable force move me about like a\nmechanical robot?\"\n\n\"But.... You can think of no explanation?\" I was a bit skeptical of his\nstory.\n\nHe turned on me savagely.\n\n\"I have no explanation. Doctor,\" he said curtly. \"I came to you for the\nexplanation. And while you are thinking over my case during the next few\nhours, perhaps you can explain this: when I stood before that gray\nmansion on After Street, alone in the dark, there was murder in my\nheart. I should have killed the man who lived in that house, had I not\nbeen suddenly released from the force that was driving me forward!\"\n\nSir John turned from me in bitterness. Without offering any word of\ndeparture, he pulled open the door and stepped across the sill. The door\nclosed, and I was alone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat was my introduction to Sir John Harmon. I offer it in detail\nbecause it was the first of a startling series of events that led to the\nmost terrible case of my career. In my records I have labeled the entire\ncase \"The Affair of the Death Machine.\"\n\nTwelve hours after Sir John's departure--which will bring the time, to\nthe morning of December 8--the headlines of the Daily Mail stared up at\nme from the table. They were black and heavy: those headlines, and\nhorribly significant. They were:\n\n  FRANKLIN WHITE Jr. FOUND\n  MURDERED\n\n  Midnight Marauder Strangles\n  Young Society Man in West-End\n  Mansion\n\nI turned the paper hurriedly, and read:\n\n     Between the hours of one and two o'clock this morning, an unknown\n     murderer entered the home of Franklin White, Jr., well known\n     West-End sportsman, and escaped, leaving behind his strangled\n     victim.\n\n     Young White, who is a favorite in London upper circles, was\n     discovered in his bed this morning, where he had evidently lain\n     dead for many hours. Police are seeking a motive for the crime,\n     which may have its origin in the fact that White only recently\n     announced his engagement to Margot Vernee, young and exceedingly\n     pretty French d\u00e9butante.\n\n     Police say that the murderer was evidently an amateur, and that he\n     made no attempt to cover his crime. Inspector Thomas Drake of\n     Scotland Yard has the case.\n\nThere was more, much more. Young White had evidently been a decided\nfavorite, and the murder had been so unexpected, so deliberate, that the\nMail reporter had made the most of his opportunity for a story. But\naside from what I have reprinted, there was only a single short\nparagraph which claimed my attention. It was this:\n\n     The White home is not a difficult one to enter. It is a huge gray\n     town-house, situated just off the square, in After Street. The\n     murderer entered by a low French window, leaving it open.\n\nI have copied the words exactly as they were printed. The item does not\ncall for any comment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut I had hardly dropped the paper before she stood before me. I say\n\"she\"--it was Margot Vernee, of course--because for some peculiar reason\nI had expected her. She stood quietly before me, her cameo face, set in\nthe black of mourning, staring straight into mine.\n\n\"You know why I have come?\" she said quickly.\n\nI glanced at the paper on the table before me, and nodded. Her eyes\nfollowed my glance.\n\n\"That is only part of it, Doctor,\" she said. \"I was in love with\nFranklin--very much--but I have come to you for something more. Because\nyou are a famous psychologist, and can help me.\"\n\nShe sat down quietly, leaning forward so that her arms rested on the\ntable. Her face was white, almost as white as the face of that young\nadventurer who had come to me on the previous evening. And when she\nspoke, her voice was hardly more than a whisper.\n\n\"Doctor, for many days now I have been under some strange power.\nSomething frightful, that compels me to think and act against my will.\"\n\nShe glanced at me suddenly, as if to note the effect of her words. Then:\n\n\"I was engaged to Franklin for more than a month, Doctor: yet for a\nweek now I have been commanded--commanded--by some awful force, to\nreturn to--to a man who knew me more than two years ago. I can't explain\nit. I did not love this man; I hated him bitterly. Now comes this mad\ndesire, this hungering, to go to him. And last night--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMargot Vernee hesitated suddenly. She stared at me searchingly. Then,\nwith renewed courage, she continued.\n\n\"Last night, Doctor, I was alone. I had retired for the night, and it\nwas late, nearly three o'clock. And then I was strangely commanded, by\nthis awful power that has suddenly taken possession, of my soul, to go\nout. I tried to restrain myself, and in the end I found myself walking\nthrough the square. I went straight to Franklin White's home. When I\nreached there, it was half past three--I could hear Big Ben. I went\nin--through the wide French window at the side of the house. I went\nstraight to Franklin's room--_because I could not prevent myself from\ngoing_.\"\n\nA sob came from Margot's lips. She had half risen from her chair, and\nwas holding herself together with a brave effort. I went to her side and\nstood over her. And she, with a half crazed laugh, stared up at me.\n\n\"He was dead when I saw him!\" she cried. \"Dead! Murdered! That infernal\nforce, what ever it was, had made me go straight to my lover's side, to\nsee him lying there, with those cruel finger marks on his throat--dead,\nI tell you, I--oh, it is horrible!\"\n\nShe turned suddenly.\n\n\"When I saw him,\" she said bitterly, \"the sight of him--and the sight of\nthose marks--broke the spell that held me. I crept from the house as if\nI had killed him. They--they will probably find out that I was there,\nand they will accuse me of the murder. It does not matter. But this\npower--this awful thing that has been controlling me--is there no way\nto fight it?\"\n\nI nodded heavily. The memory, of that unfortunate fellow who had come to\nme with the same complaint was still holding me. I was prepared to wash\nmy hands of the whole horrible affair. It was clearly not a medical\ncase, clearly out of my realm.\n\n\"There is a way to fight it,\" I said quietly. \"I am a doctor, not a\nmaster of hypnotism, or a man who can discover the reasons behind that\nhypnotism. But London has its Scotland Yard, and Scotland Yard has a man\nwho is one of my greatest comrades....\"\n\nShe nodded her surrender. As I stepped to the telephone, I heard her\nmurmur, in a weary, troubled voice:\n\n\"Hypnotism? It is not that. God knows what it is. But it has always\nhappened when I have been alone. One cannot hypnotise through\ndistance....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd so, with Margot Vernee's consent, I sought the aid of Inspector\nThomas Drake, of Scotland Yard. In half an hour Drake stood beside me,\nin the quiet of my study. When he had heard Margot's story, he asked a\nsingle significant question. It was this:\n\n\"You say you have a desire to go back to a man who was once intimate\nwith you. Who is he?\"\n\nMargot looked at him dully.\n\n\"It is Michael Strange,\" she said slowly. \"Michael Strange, of Paris. A\nstudent of science.\"\n\nDrake nodded. Without further questioning he dismissed my patient; and\nwhen she had gone, he turned to me.\n\n\"She did not murder her sweetheart, Dale\" he said. \"That is evident.\nHave you any idea who did?\"\n\nAnd so I told him of that other young man. Sir John Harmon, who had come\nto me the night before. When I had finished. Drake stared at me--stared\nthrough me--and suddenly turned on his heel.\n\n\"I shall be back, Dale,\" he said curtly. \"Wait for me!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWait for him! Well, that was Drake's peculiar way of going about things.\nImpetuous, sudden--until he faced some crisis. Then, in the face of\ndanger, he became a cold, indifferent officer of Scotland Yard.\n\nAnd so I waited. During the twenty-four hours that elapsed before Drake\nreturned to my study, I did my best to diagnose the case before me.\nFirst, Sir John Harmon--his visit to the home of Franklin White.\nThen--the deliberate murder. And, finally, young Margot Vernee, and her\nconfession. It was like the revolving whirl of a pinwheel, this series\nof events: continuous and mystifying, but without beginning or end.\nSurely, somewhere in the procession of horrors, there would be a loose\nend to cling to. Some loose end that would eventually unravel the\npinwheel!\n\nIt was plainly not a medical affair, or at least only remotely so. The\nthing was in proper hands, then, with Drake following it through. And I\nhad only to wait for his return.\n\nHe came at last, and closed the door of the room behind him. He stood\nover me with something of a swagger.\n\n\"Dale, I have been looking into the records of this Michael Strange,\" he\nsaid quietly. \"They are interesting, those records. They go back some\nten years, when this fellow Strange was beginning his study of science.\nAnd now Michael Strange is one of the greatest authorities in Paris on\nthe subject of mental telegraphy. He has gone into the study of human\nthought with the same thoroughness that other scientists go into the\nsubject of radio telegraphy. He has written several books on the\nsubject.\"\n\nDrake pulled a tiny black volume from the pocket of his coat and dropped\nit on the table before me. With one hand he opened it to a place which\nhe had previously marked in pencil.\n\n\"Read it,\" he said significantly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI looked at him in wonder, and then did as he ordered. What I read was\nthis:\n\n\"Mental telegraphy is a science, not a myth. It is a very real fact, a\nvery real power which can be developed only by careful research. To most\npeople it is merely a curiosity. They sit, for instance, in a crowded\nroom at some uninteresting lecture, and stare continually at the back of\nsome unsuspecting companion until that companion, by the power of\nsuggestion, turns suddenly around. Or they think heavily of a certain\nperson nearby, perhaps commanding him mentally to hum a certain popular\ntune, until the victim, by the power of their will, suddenly fulfills\nthe order. To such persons, the science of mental telegraphy is merely\nan amusement.\n\n\"And so it will be, until science has brought it to such a perfection\nthat these waves of thought can be broadcast--that they can be\ntransmitted through the ether precisely as radio waves are transmitted.\nIn other words, mental telegraphy is at present merely a mild form of\nhypnotism. Until it has been developed so that those hypnotic powers can\nbe directed through space, and directed accurately to those individuals\nto whom they are intended, this science will have no significance. It\nremains for scientists of to-day to bring about that development.\"\n\nI closed the book. When I looked up, Drake was watching me intently, as\nif expecting me to say something.\n\n\"Drake,\" I said slowly, more to myself than to him, \"the pinwheel is\nbeginning to unravel. We have found the beginning thread. Perhaps, if we\nfollow that thread....\"\n\nDrake smiled.\n\n\"If you'll pick up your hat and coat, Dale,\" he interrupted, \"I think we\nhave an appointment. This Michael Strange, whose book you have just\nenjoyed so immensely, is now residing on a certain quiet little side\nstreet about three miles from the square, in London!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI followed Drake in silence, until we had left Cheney Lane in the gloom\nbehind us. At the entrance to the square my companion called a cab; and\nfrom there on we rode slowly, through a heavy darkness which was\nblanketed by a wet, penetrating fog. The cabby, evidently one who knew\nmy companion by sight (and what London cabby does not know his Scotland\nYard men!) chose a route that twisted through gloomy, uninhabited side\nstreets, seldom winding into the main route of traffic.\n\nAs for Drake, he sank back in the uncomfortable seat and made no attempt\nat conversation. For the entire first part of our journey he said\nnothing. Not until we had reached a black, unlighted section of the city\ndid he turn to me.\n\n\"Dale,\" he said at length, \"have you ever hunted tiger?\"\n\nI looked at him and laughed.\n\n\"Why?\" I replied. \"Do you expect this hunt of ours will be something of\na blind chase?\"\n\n\"It will be a blind chase, no doubt of it,\" he said. \"And when we have\nfollowed the trail to its end, I imagine we shall find something very\nlike a tiger to deal with. I have looked rather deeply into Michael\nStrange's life, and unearthed a bit of the man's character. He has twice\nbeen accused of murder--murder by hypnotism--and has twice cleared\nhimself by throwing scientific explanations at the police. That is the\nnature of his entire history for the past ten years.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI nodded, without replying. As Drake turned away from me again, our cab\npoked its laboring nose into a narrowing, gloomy street. I had a glimpse\nof a single unsteady street lamp on the corner, and a dim sign, \"Mate\nLane.\" And then we were dragging along the curb. The cab stopped with a\ngroan.\n\nI had stepped down and was standing by the cab door when suddenly, from\nthe darkness in front of me, a strange figure advanced to my side. He\nglanced at me intently; then, seeing that I was evidently not the man he\nsought, he turned to Drake. I heard a whispered greeting and an\nundertone of conversation. Then, quietly, Drake stepped toward me.\n\n\"Dale,\" he said. \"I thought it best that I should not show myself here\nto-night. No, there is no time for explanation now; you will understand\nlater. Perhaps\"--significantly--\"sooner than you anticipate. Inspector\nHartnett will go through the rest of this pantomime with you.\"\n\nI shook hands with Drake's man, still rather bewildered at the sudden\nsubstitution. Then, before I was aware of it, Drake had vanished and the\ncab was gone. We were alone, Hartnett and I, in Mate Lane.\n\nThe home of Michael Strange--number seven--was hardly inviting. No light\nwas in evidence. The big house stood like a huge, unadorned vault set\nback from the street, some distance from its adjoining buildings. The\nheavy steps echoed to our footbeats as we mounted them in the darkness;\nand the sound of the bell, as Hartnett pressed it came sharply to us\nfrom the silence of the interior.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe stood there, waiting. In the short interval before the door opened,\nHartnett glanced at his watch (it was nearly ten o'clock), and said to\nme:\n\n\"I imagine, Doctor, we shall meet a blank wall. Let me do the talking,\nplease.\"\n\nThat was all. In another moment the big door was pulled slowly open from\nthe inside, and in the entrance, glaring out at us, stood the man we had\ncome to see. It is not hard to remember that first impression of Michael\nStrange. He was a huge man, gaunt and haggard, moulded with the hunched\nshoulders and heavy arms of a gorilla. His face seemed to be\nunconsciously twisted into a snarl. His greeting, which came only after\nhe had stared at us intently, for nearly a minute, was curt and\nrasping.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen? What is it?\"\n\n\"I should like a word with Dr. Michael Strange,\" said my companion\nquietly.\n\n\"I am Michael Strange.\"\n\n\"And I,\" replied Hartnett, with a suggestion of a smile, \"am Raoul\nHartnett, from Scotland Yard.\"\n\nI did not see any sign of emotion on Strange's face. He stepped back in\nsilence to allow us to enter. Then closing the big door after us, he led\nthe way along a carpeted hall to a small, ill-lighted room just beyond.\nHere he motioned us to be seated, he himself standing upright beside the\ntable, facing us.\n\n\"From Scotland Yard,\" he said, and the tone was heavy with dull sarcasm.\n\"I am at your service, Mr. Hartnett.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd now, for the first time, I wondered just why Drake had insisted on\nmy coming here to this gloomy house in Mate Lane. Why he had so\ndeliberately arranged a substitute so that Michael Strange should not\ncome face to face with him directly. Evidently Hartnett had been\ncarefully instructed as to his course of action--but why this seemingly\nunnecessary caution on Drake's part? And now, after we had gained\nadmission, what excuse would Hartnett offer for the intrusion? Surely he\nwould not follow the bull-headed r\u00f4le of a common policeman!\n\nThere was no anger, no attempt at dramatics, in Hartnett's voice. He\nlooked quietly up at our host.\n\n\"Dr. Strange,\" he said at length, \"I have come to you for your\nassistance. Last night, some time after midnight, Franklin White was\nstrangled to death. He was murdered, according to substantial evidence,\nby the girl he was going to marry--Margot Vernee. I come to you because\nyou know this girl rather well, and can perhaps help Scotland Yard in\nfinding her motive for killing White.\"\n\nMichael Strange said nothing. He stood there, scowling down at my\ncompanion in silence. And I, too, I must admit, turned upon Hartnett\nwith a stare of bewilderment. His accusation of Margot had brought a\nsense of horror to me. I had expected almost anything from him, even to\na mad accusation of Strange himself. But I had hardly foreseen this cold\nblooded declaration.\n\n\"You understand, Doctor,\" Hartnett went on, in that same ironical drawl,\n\"that we do not believe Margot Vernee did this thing herself. She had a\ncompanion, undoubtedly, one who accompanied her to the house on After\nStreet, and assisted her in the crime. Who that companion was, we are\nnot sure; but there is decidedly a case of suspicion against a certain\nyoung London sportsman. This fellow is known to have prowled about the\nWhite mansion both on the night of the murder and the night before.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHartnett glanced up casually. Strange's face was a total mask. When he\nnodded, the nod was the most even and mechanical thing I have ever seen.\nCertainly this man could control his emotions!\n\n\"Naturally, Doctor,\" Hartnett said, \"we have gone rather deeply into the\npast life of the lady in question. Your name appears, of course, in a\nrather unimportant interval when Margot Vernee resided in Paris. And so\nwe come to you in the hope that you can perhaps give us some slight bit\nof information--something that seems insignificant, perhaps, to you, but\nwhich may put us on the right track.\"\n\nIt was a careful speech. Even as Hartnett spoke it, I could have sworn\nthat the words were Drake's, and had been memorized. But Michael Strange\nmerely stepped back to the table and faced us without a word. He was\nprobably, during that brief interlude, attempting to realize his\nposition, and to discover just how much Raoul Hartnett actually knew.\n\nAnd then, after his interim of silence, he came forward sullenly and\nstood over my comrade.\n\n\"I will tell you this much, Mr. Hartnett of Scotland Yard,\" he said\nbitterly: \"My relations with Margot Vernee are not an open book to be\npassed through the clumsy fingers of ignorant police officers. As to\nthis murder, I know nothing. At the time of it, I was seated in this\nroom in company with a distinguished group of scientific friends. I will\ntell you, on authority, that Margot _did not murder her lover_. Why?\nBecause she loved him!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe last words were heavy with bitterness. Before they had died into\nsilence, Michael Strange had opened the door of his study.\n\n\"If you please, gentlemen,\" he said quietly.\n\nHartnett got to his feet. For an instant he stood facing the\ngorilla-like form of our host; then he stepped over the sill, without a\nword. We passed down the unlighted corridor in silence, while Strange\nstood in the door of his study, watching us. I could not help but feel,\nas we left that gloomy house, that Strange had suddenly focused his\nentire attention upon me, and had ignored my companion. I could feel\nthose eyes upon me, and feel the force of the will behind them. A\ndecided feeling of uneasiness crept over me, and I shuddered.\n\nA moment later the big outer door had closed shut after us, and we were\nalone in Mate Lane. Alone, that is, until a third figure joined us in\nthe shadows, and Drake's hand closed over my arm.\n\n\"Capital, Dale,\" he said triumphantly. \"For half an hour you entertained\nhim, you and Hartnett. And for half an hour I've had the unlimited\nfreedom of his inner rooms, with the aid of an unlocked window on the\nlower floor. Those inner rooms, gentlemen, are significant--very!\"\n\nAs we walked the length of Mate Lane, the gaunt, sinister home of\nMichael Strange became an indistinct outline in the pitch behind us.\nDrake said nothing more on the return trip, until we had nearly reached\nmy rooms. Then he turned to me with a smile.\n\n\"We are one up on our friend, Dale,\" he said. \"He does not know, just\nnow, which is the bigger fool--you or Hartnett here. However, I imagine\nHartnett will be the victim of some very unusual events before many\nhours have passed!\"\n\nThat was all. At least, all of significance. I left the two Scotland\nYard men at the opening of Cheney Lane, and continued alone to my rooms.\nI opened the door and let myself in quietly. And there some few hours\nlater, began the last and most horrible phase of the case of the murder\nmachine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt begin--or to be more accurate, I began to react to it--at three\no'clock in the morning. I was alone, and the rooms were dark. For hours\nI had sat quietly by the table, considering the significant events of\nthe past few days. Sleep was impossible with so many unanswered\nquestions staring into me, and so I sat there wondering.\n\nDid Drake actually believe that Margot Vernee's simple story had been a\nruse--that she had in truth killed her lover on that midnight intrusion\nof his home? Did he believe that Michael Strange knew of that\nintrusion--that he had possibly planned it himself, and aided her, in\norder that Margot might be free to return to him? Did Strange know of\nthat other intrusion, and of the uncanny power which had driven Sir John\nHarmon, and supposedly driven Margot to that house on After Street?\n\nThose were the questions that still remained without answers: and it was\nover those questions that I pondered, while my surroundings became\ndarker and more silent as the hour became more advanced. I heard the\nclock strike three, and heard the answering drone of Big Ben from the\nsquare.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then it began. At first it was little more than a sense of\nnervousness. Before I had been content to sit in my chair and doze. Now,\nin spite of myself, I found myself pacing the floor, back and forth like\na caged animal. I could have sworn, at the time, that some sinister\npresence had found entrance to my room. Yet the room was empty. And I\ncould have sworn, too, that some silent power of will was commanding me,\nwith undeniable force, to go out--out into the darkness of Cheney Lane.\n\nI fought it bitterly. I laughed at it, yet even through my laugh came\nthe memory of Sir John Harmon and Margot, and what they had told me. And\nthen, unable to resist that unspoken demand, I seized my hat and coat\nand went out.\n\nCheney Lane was deserted, utterly still. At the end of it, the street\nlamp glowed dully, throwing a patch of ghastly light over the side of\nthe adjoining building. I hurried through the shadows, and as I walked,\na single idea had possession of me. I must hurry, I thought, with all\npossible speed, to that grim house in Mate Lane--number seven.\n\nWhere that deliberate desire came from I did not know. I did not stop to\nreason. Something had commanded me to go at once to Michael Strange's\nhome. And though I stopped more than once, deliberately turning in my\ntracks, inevitably I was forced to retrace my steps and continue.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI remember passing through the square, and prowling through the\nunlightened side streets that lay beyond. Three miles separated Cheney\nLane from Mate Lane, and I had been over the route only once before, in\na cab. Yet I followed that route without a single false turn, followed\nit instinctively. At every intersecting street I was dragged in a\ncertain direction and not once was I allowed to hesitate. It was as\nthough some unseen demon perched on my shoulders, as the demon of the\nsea rode Sinbad, and pointed out the way.\n\nOnly one disturbing thing occurred on that night journey through London.\nI had turned into a narrow street hardly more than a quarter mile from\nmy destination; and before me, in the shadows, I made out the form of a\nshuffling old man. And here, as I watched him, I was conscious of a new,\nmad desire. I crept upon him stealthily, without a sound. My hands were\noutstretched, clutching, for his throat. At that moment I should have\nkilled him!\n\nI cannot explain it. During that brief interval I was a murderer at\nheart. I wanted to kill. And now that I remember it, the desire had been\npregnant in me ever since the lights of Cheney Lane had died behind me.\nAll the time that I prowled through those black streets, murder lurked\nin my heart. I should have killed the first man who crossed my path.\n\nBut I did not kill him. Thank God, as my fingers twisted toward the back\nof his throat, that mad desire suddenly left me. I stood still, while\nthe old fellow, still unsuspecting, shuffled, away into the darkness.\nThen, dropping my hands with a sob of helplessness, I went forward\nagain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd so I reached Mate Lane, and the huge gray house that awaited me.\nThis time, as I mounted the stone steps, the old house seemed even more\nrepulsive and horrible. I dreaded to see that door open, but I could not\nretreat.\n\nI dropped the knocker heavily. A moment passed: and then, precisely as\nbefore, the huge door swung inward. Michael Strange stood before me.\n\nHe did not speak. Perhaps, if he had spoken, that fiendish spell would\nhave been broken, and I should have returned, even then, to my own\npeaceful little rooms in Cheney Lane. No--he merely held the door for\nme to enter, and as I passed him he stood there, watching me with a\nsignificant smile.\n\nStraight to that familiar room at the end of the hall I went, with\nStrange behind me. When we had entered, he closed the door cautiously.\nFor a moment he faced me without speaking.\n\n\"You came very close to committing a murder on your way here, did you\nnot, Dale?\"\n\nI stared at him. How, in God's name, could this man read my thoughts so\ncompletely?\n\n\"You would have completed the murder,\" he said softly, \"had I wished it.\nI did not wish it!\"\n\nI did not answer. There was no reply to such a mad declaration. As for\nmy companion, he watched me for an instant and then laughed. He was not\nmad. I am doctor enough to know that.\n\nBut the laugh was not long in duration. He stepped forward suddenly and\ntook my arm in a steel grip, dragging me toward the half hidden door at\nthe farther end of the room.\n\n\"I shall not keep you long, Dale,\" he said harshly. \"I could have killed\nyou--could have made you kill yourself, and in fact, I intended to do\nso--but after all, you are merely a poor stumbling fool who has meddled\nin things too deep for you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe pulled open the door and pushed me forward. The room was dark, and\nnot until he had closed the door again and switched on a dim light,\ncould I see its contents.\n\nEven then I saw nothing. At least, nothing of importance to an\nunscientific mind. There was a low table against the wall, with a\nprofusion of tiny wires emanating from it. I was aware that a cup shaped\nmicrophone--or something very similar--hung over the table, about on a\nlevel with my eyes, had I been sitting in the chair. Beyond that I saw\nnothing, until Strange had moved forward and drawn aside a curtain that\nhung beside the table.\n\n\"I made you come here to-night, Dale,\" he murmured, \"because I was a bit\nafraid of you. Your comrade, Hartnett, was an ignorant police officer.\nHe has not the intellect to connect the series of events of the past day\nor two, and so I did not trouble myself with him. But you are an\neducated man. You have made no demonstrations of your ability in the\nfield of science, but--\"\n\nHe stopped speaking abruptly. From the room behind us came the sound of\na warning bell. Strange turned quickly and went to the door.\n\n\"You will wait here, Doctor,\" he said. \"I have another caller to-night.\nAnother one who came the same way as you!\"\n\nHe vanished. For a short interlude I was alone, with that peculiar\nradio-like apparatus before me. It was, for all the world, like a\nminiature control room in some small broadcasting station. Except for\nthe odd shape of the microphone, if it was such I could detect no\nradical difference in equipment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHowever, I had little time for conjecture. A patter of footsteps\ninterrupted me from the next room, and a frightened, feminine voice\nbroke the stillness of the outer study. Even before the owner of that\nvoice stepped in to my presence, I knew her.\n\nAnd when she came, with white, fearful face and trembling body, I could\nnot withhold a shudder of apprehension. It was the young woman who had\ncome to my office--Margot Vernee. Evidently, at last, she had yielded to\nthe horrible impulse that had drawn her back to Michael Strange, an\nimpulse which, I now understood, had originated from the man himself.\n\nHe pressed her forward. There was nothing tender in his touch: it was\ncruel and triumphant.\n\n\"So you have succeeded--at last,\" I said bitterly.\n\nHe turned to me with a sneer.\n\n\"I have brought her here, yes,\" he replied. \"And now that she has come,\nshe shall hear what I have to tell you. It will perhaps give her a\nrespect for me, and this time she will not have the power to turn me\naway.\"\n\nHe pointed to the table, to the apparatus that lay there.\n\n\"I'm telling you this, Dale,\" he said, \"because it gives me pleasure to\ndo so. You are enough of a scientist to appreciate and understand it.\nAnd if, when I have finished, I have told you too much, there is a very\neasy way to keep your tongue silent. You have heard of hypnotism, Dale?\nYou have heard also of radio? Have you ever thought of combining the\ntwo?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe faced me directly. I made no effort to reply.\n\n\"Radio,\" he said quietly, \"is broadcast by means of sound waves. That\nmuch you know. But hypnotism too, can be transmitted through distance,\nif an instrument delicate enough to transmit _thought waves_ can be\ninvented. For twenty years I have worked on that instrument, and for\ntwenty years I have studied hypnotism. You understand, of course, that\nthis instrument is worthless unless it is operated by a master mind.\nThought waves are useless; they will not control the actions of even a\ncat. But hypnotic waves or concentrated thought waves--will control the\nworld.\"\n\nThere was no denying him. He faced me with the savage triumph of a wild\nbeast. He was glorying in his power, and in my amazement.\n\n\"I wanted Franklin White to die!\" he cried. \"It was I who murdered him.\nWhy? Because he was about to take the girl I desired. Is that not reason\nenough for murder? And so I killed him. It was not Margot Vernee who\nstrangled her lover: it was a complete stranger, a London sportsman, who\nhad no reason for committing the murder, _except that I wished him to_!\n\n\"He died on the night of December seventh, murdered by Sir John Harmon,\nthe sportsman. Why? Because, of all London, Sir John would be the last\nman to be suspected. I have a keen appreciation for the irony of fate!\nWhite would have died the night before, Dale, except that I lacked the\ncourage to kill him. His murderer was standing, under my power, outside\nhis very house--and then I suddenly thought it best that I should have\nan alibi. Your Scotland Yard is clever, and it was best that I have\nprotection. And so, on the following night, I sent Sir John to the house\nonce again. This time, while I sat here and controlled the actions of my\npuppet, a group of men sat here with me. They believed that I was\nexperimenting with a new type of radio receiver!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMichael Strange laughed, laughed harshly, in utter triumph, as a cat\nlaughs at the antics of his mouse victims.\n\n\"When that murder was done,\" he said, \"I sent Margot to the scene, so\nthat she might see her lover strangled, dead. I repeat, Dale, that I\nenjoy the irony of fate, especially when I can control it. And as for\nyou--I brought you here to-night merely so that you would realize the\nintensity of the powers that control you. When you leave here, you will\nbe unharmed--but after the exhibition I shall give you, I am sure that\nyou will make no further attempt to interfere with things out of your\nrealm of understanding.\"\n\nI heard a sob from Margot. She had retreated to the door, and clung\nthere. For myself, I did not move. Strange's recital had revealed to me\nthe horrible lust that gripped him, and now I watched him in\nfascination. He would not harm the girl; that much I was sure of. In his\ndistorted fashion he loved her. In his crazed, murderous way he would\nattempt to win her love, even though she had once scorned him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI saw him step toward the table. Saw him drop heavily into the chair,\nand stare directly into that microphonic thing that hung before his\neyes. As he stared, he spoke to me.\n\n\"Science, in its intricate forms, is probably above the mind of a common\nmedical man, Dale,\" he said. \"It would be useless to explain to you how\nmy thoughts--and my will--can be transmitted through space. Perhaps you\nhave sat in a theater and stared at a certain person until that person\nturned to face you. You have? Then you will perhaps understand how I can\ncontrol the minds of any human creature within the radius of my power.\nYou see, Dale, this intricate little machine gives me the power to\ntransform London into a city of stark murder. I could bring about such a\nhorrible wave of crime that Scotland Yard would be scorned from one end\nof the world to the other. I could make every man murder his neighbor,\nuntil the streets of the city were running with blood!\"\n\nStrange turned quietly to look at me. He spoke deliberately.\n\n\"And now for the little exhibition of which I spoke, Dale,\" he murmured.\n\"Your detective friend, Hartnett, has been under my power for the past\nthree hours. You see, it was safer to control his movements, and be sure\nof him. And now, to be doubly sure of him, perhaps you would like to see\nhim kill himself!\"\n\nI stepped forward with a sudden cry. Strange said nothing: his eyes\nmerely burned into mine. Once again I felt that strange, all-powerful\ncontrol forcing me back. I retreated, step by step, until the wall\nstopped me. Yet even as I retreated, a childish hope filled me. How\ncould Strange, working his terrible murder machine, concentrate his\npower on any individual, when the whole of London lay before him?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe answered my question. He must have read it as it came over me.\n\n\"Have you ever been in a crowd, Dale, and watched a certain individual\nintently, until that particular individual turned to look at you? The\nrest of the crowd pays no attention, of course, but that one man. And\nnow we shall make that one man murder himself!\"\n\nStrange turned slowly. I saw his fingers creep along the rim of the\ntable, touching certain wires that came together there. I heard a dull,\ndroning hum fill the room, and, over it, Strange's penetrating voice.\n\n\"When I am finished, Dale, I shall probably kill you. I brought you here\nmerely to frighten you, but I believe I have told you too much.\"\n\nWith that new horror upon me, I saw my captor's lips move slowly....\n\nAnd then, from the shadows at the other end of the small room, came a\nlow, unemotional voice.\n\n\"Before you begin, Strange--\"\n\nMichael Strange whipped about in his chair like a tiger. His hand\ndropped to his pocket, so swiftly that my eyes did not follow it. And as\nit dropped, a single staccato shot split the darkness of the room. The\nscientist slumped forward in his chair.\n\nThe dull, whirring sound of that hellish machine had stopped abruptly,\ncut short by the sudden weight of Strange's lunging body as he fell upon\nit. I saw the livid, fiery snake of white light twist suddenly upward\nthrough that coil of wires: and in another moment the entire apparatus\nshattered by a blinding crash of flame.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter that I turned away. Whether the bullet killed Strange or not, I do\nnot know: but the sight of his charred face, hanging over that table of\ndestruction, told its own story.\n\nIt was Inspector Drake who came across the room toward me, and took my\narm. The smoking revolver still lay in his hand, and as he led me into\nthe adjoining room, I saw that Margot had already found refuge there.\n\n\"You see now, Dale,\" Drake said quietly, \"why I let Hartnett go with you\nbefore? If Strange had suspected me, I should have been merely another\nvictim. As for Hartnett, he has been under constant guard down at\nheadquarters. He's safe. They've kept him there, at my instructions, in\nspite of all his terrific efforts to leave them.\"\n\nI was listening to my companion in admiration. Even then I did not quite\nunderstand.\n\n\"I was wrong in just one thing, Dale. I left you alone, without\nprotection. I believed Strange would ignore you, because, after all, you\nare not a Scotland Yard man. Thank God I had the sense to follow\nMargot--to trail her here--and get here soon enough.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd so ended the horrible series of events that began with Sir John\nHarmon's chance visit to my study. As for Harmon, he was later cleared\nof all guilt, upon the charred evidence in Michael Strange's house in\nMate Lane. The girl, I believe, has left London, where she can be as far\nas possible from memories that are all too terrible.\n\nAs for me, I am back once again in my quiet rooms in Cheney Lane, where\nthe routine of common medical practice has wiped out many of those vivid\nhorrors. In time, I believe, I shall forget, unless Inspector Drake, of\nScotland Yard, insists upon bringing the affair up again!\n\n\n\n  _IN THE NEXT ISSUE_\n\n  THE INVISIBLE DEATH\n\n  _A Thrilling Novelet of an Invisible\n  Empire Within the United States_\n\n  _By_ Victor Rousseau\n\n  STOLEN BRAINS\n\n  _Another Absorbing Dr. Bird Story_\n\n  _By_ Capt.

P. Meek_\n\n     \"No one knows what unrevealed horrors space holds and the world\n     will never rest entirely easy until the slow process of time again\n     heals the protective layer.\"--From \"Beyond the Heaviside Layer.\"\n\n\nOver a year has passed since I wrote those lines. When they were written\nthe hole which Jim Carpenter had burned with his battery of infra-red\nlamps through the heaviside layer, that hollow sphere of invisible\nsemi-plastic organic matter which encloses the world as a nutshell does\na kernel, was gradually filling in as he had predicted it would: every\none thought that in another ten years the world would be safely enclosed\nagain in its protective layer as it had been since the dawn of time.\nThere were some adventurous spirits who deplored this fact, as it would\neffectually bar interplanetary travel, for Hadley had proved with his\nlife that no space flyer could force its way through the fifty miles of\nalmost solid material which barred the road to space, but they were in\nthe minority. Most of humanity felt that it would rather be protected\nagainst the denizens of space than to have a road open for them to\ntravel to the moon if they felt inclined.\n\n[Sidenote: From a far world came monstrous invaders who were all the\nmore terrifying because invisible.]\n\nTo be sure, during the five years that the hole had been open, nothing\nmore dangerous to the peace and well-being of the world had appeared\nfrom space than a few hundreds of the purple amoeba which we had found\nso numerous on the outer side of the layer, when we had traveled in a\nHadley space ship up through the hole into the outer realms of space,\nand one lone specimen of the green dragons which we had also\nencountered. The amoeba had been readily destroyed by the disintegrating\nrays of the guarding space-ships which were stationed inside the layer\nat the edge of the hole and the lone dragon had fallen a ready victim to\nthe machine-gun bullets which had been poured into it. At first the\npress had damned Jim Carpenter for opening the road for these horrors,\nbut once their harmlessness had been clearly established, the row had\ndied down and the appearance of an amoeba did not merit over a squib on\nthe inside pages of the daily papers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile the hole in the heaviside layer was no longer news for the daily\npress, a bitter controversy still waged in the scientific journals as to\nthe reason why no observer on earth, even when using the most powerful\ntelescopes, could see the amoeba before they entered the hole, and then\nonly when their telescopes were set up directly under the hole. When a\ntelescope of even small power was mounted in the grounds back of\nCarpenter's laboratory, the amoeba could be detected as soon as they\nentered the hole, or when they passed above it through space; but, aside\nfrom that point of vantage, they were entirely invisible.\n\nCarpenter's theory of the absorptive powers of the material of which the\nheaviside layer was composed was laughed to scorn by most scientists,\nwho pointed out the fact that the sun, moon and stars could be readily\nseen through it. Carpenter replied that the rays of colored or visible\nlight could only pass through the layer when superimposed upon a carrier\nwave of ultra-violet or invisible light. He stated dogmatically that the\namoeba and the other denizens of space absorbed all the ultra-violet\nlight which fell on them and reflected only the visible rays which could\nnot pass through the heaviside layer because of the lack of a\nsynchronized carrier wave of shorter wave-length.\n\nDespetier replied at great length and showed by apparently unimpeachable\nmathematics that Carpenter was entirely wrong and that his statements\nshowed an absolute lack of knowledge of the most elementary and\nfundamental laws of light transmission. Carpenter replied briefly that\nhe could prove by mathematics that two was equal to one and he\nchallenged Despetier or anyone else to satisfactorily explain the\nobserved facts in any other way. While they vainly tried to do so,\nCarpenter lapsed into silence in his Los Angeles laboratory and delved\never deeper into the problems of science. Such was the situation when\nthe attack came from space.\n\nMy first knowledge of the attack came when McQuarrie, the city editor of\nthe San Francisco _Clarion_, sent for me. When I entered his office he\ntossed a Los Angeles dispatch on the desk before me and with a growl\nordered me to read it. It told of the unexplained disappearance of an\neleven year old boy the night before. It looked like a common\nkidnapping.\n\n\"Well?\" I asked as I handed him back the dispatch.\n\nWith another growl he tossed down a second telegram. I read it with\nastonishment, for it told of a second disappearance which had happened\nabout an hour after the first. The similarity of the two cases was at\nonce apparent.\n\n\"Coincidence or connection?\" I asked as I returned it.\n\n\"Find out!\" he replied. \"If I knew which it was I wouldn't be wasting\nthe paper's money by sending you to Los Angeles. I don't doubt that I am\nwasting it anyway, but as long as I am forced to keep you on as a\nreporter, I might as well try to make you earn the money the owner\nwastes on paying you a salary, even although I know it to be a hopeless\ntask. Go on down there and see what you can find out, if anything.\"\n\nI jotted down in my notebook the names and addresses of the missing\nchildren and turned to leave. A boy entered and handed McQuarrie a\nyellow slip. He glanced at it and called me back.\n\n\"Wait a minute, Bond,\" he said as he handed me the dispatch. \"I doubt\nbut you'd better fly down to Los Angeles. Another case has just been\nreported.\"\n\nI hastily copied down the dispatch he handed me, which was almost a\nduplicate of the first two with the exception of the time and the name.\nThree unexplained disappearances in one day was enough to warrant speed;\nI drew some expense money and was on my way south in a chartered plane\nwithin an hour.\n\nOn my arrival I went to the Associated Press office and found a message\nwaiting for me, directing me to call McQuarrie on the telephone at once.\n\n\"Hello, Bond,\" came his voice over the wire, \"have you just arrived?\nWell, forget all about that disappearance case. Prince is on his way to\nLos Angeles to cover it. You hadn't been gone an hour before a wire came\nin from Jim Carpenter. He says, 'Send Bond to me at once by fastest\nconveyance. Chance for a scoop on the biggest story of the century.' I\ndon't know what it's about, but Jim Carpenter is always front page news.\nGet in touch with him at once and stay with him until you have the\nstory. Don't risk trying to telegraph it when you get it--telephone. Get\nmoving!\"\n\nI lost no time in getting Carpenter on the wire.\n\n\"Hello, First Mortgage,\" he greeted me. \"You made good time getting down\nhere. Where are you?\"\n\n\"At the A. P. Office.\"\n\n\"Grab a taxi and come out to the laboratory. Bring your grip with you:\nyou may have to stay over night.\"\n\n\"I'll be right out, Jim. What's the story?\"\n\nHis voice suddenly grew grave.\n\n\"It's the biggest thing you ever handled,\" he replied. \"The fate of the\nwhole world may hang on it. I don't want to talk over the phone; come on\nout and I'll give you the whole thing.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour later I shook hands with Tim, the guard at the gate of the\nCarpenter laboratory, and passed through the grounds to enter Jim's\nprivate office. He greeted me warmly and for a few minutes we chatted of\nold times when I worked with him as an assistant in his atomic\ndisintegration laboratory and of the stirring events we had passed\nthrough together when we had ventured outside the heaviside layer in his\nspace ship.\n\n\"Those were stirring times,\" he said, \"but I have an idea, First\nMortgage, that they were merely a Sunday school picnic compared to what\nwe are about to tackle.\"\n\n\"I guessed that you had something pretty big up your sleeve from your\nmessage.\" I replied. \"What's up now? Are we going to make a trip to the\nmoon and interview the inhabitants?\"\n\n\"We may interview them without going that far,\" he said. \"Have you seen\na morning paper?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Look at this.\"\n\nHe handed me a copy of the _Gazette_. Streamer headlines told of the\nthree disappearances which I had come to Los Angeles to cover, but they\nhad grown to five during the time I had been flying down. I looked at\nJim in surprise.\n\n\"We got word of that in San Francisco,\" I told him, \"and I came down\nhere to cover the story. When I got here, McQuarrie telephoned me your\nmessage and told me to come and see you instead. Has your message\nanything to do with this?\"\n\n\"It has everything to do with it, First Mortgage; in fact, it _is_ it.\nHave you any preconceived ideas on the disappearance epidemic?\"\n\n\"None at all.\"\n\n\"All the better--you'll be able to approach the matter with an unbiased\nviewpoint. Don't read that hooey put out by an inspired reporter who\nblames the laxness of the city government; I'll give you the facts\nwithout embellishment. Nothing beyond the bare fact of the disappearance\nis known about the first case. Robert Prosser, aged eleven, was sent to\nthe grocery store by his mother about six-thirty last night and failed\nto return. That's all we know about it, except that it happened in Eagle\nRock. The second case we have a little more data on. William Hill, aged\ntwelve, was playing in Glendale last night with some companions. They\nwere playing 'hide and go seek' and William hid. He could not be found\nby the boy who was searching and has not been found since. His\ncompanions became frightened and reported it about eight o'clock. They\nsaw nothing, but mark this! Four of them agree that they heard a sound\nin the air _like a motor humming_.\"\n\n\"That proves nothing.\"\n\n\"Taken alone it does not, but in view of the third case, it is quite\nsignificant. The third case happened about nine-thirty last night. This\ntime the victim was a girl, aged ten. She was returning home from a\nmoving picture with some companions and she disappeared. This time the\nother children saw her go. They say she was suddenly taken straight up\ninto the air and then disappeared from sight. They, also claim to have\nheard a sound like a big electric fan in the air at the time, although\nthey could see nothing.\"\n\n\"Had they heard the details of the second disappearance?\"\n\n\"They had not. I can see what you are thinking; that they were\nunconsciously influenced by the account given of the other case.\"\n\n\"Consciously or unconsciously.\"\n\n\"I doubt it, for the fourth case was almost a duplicate of the third.\nThe fourth and fifth cases happened this morning. In the fourth case the\nchild, for it was a nine year old girl this time, was lifted into the\nair in broad daylight and disappeared. This disappearance was witnessed,\nnot only by children, but also by two adults, and their testimony agrees\ncompletely with that of the children. The fifth case is similar to the\nfirst: a ten year old boy disappeared without trace. The whole city is\nin a reign of terror.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe telephone at Carpenter's elbow rang and he answered it. A short\nconversation took place and he turned to me with a grim face as he hung\nup the receiver.\n\n\"Another case has just been reported to police headquarters from Beverly\nHills,\" he said. \"Again the child was seen to be lifted into the air by\nsome invisible means and disappeared. The sound of a motor was plainly\nheard by five witnesses, who all agree that it was just, above their\nheads, but that nothing could be seen.\"\n\n\"Was it in broad daylight?\"\n\n\"Less than an hour ago.\"\n\n\"But, Jim, that's impossible!\"\n\n\"Why is it impossible?\"\n\n\"It would imply the invisibility of a tangible substance; of a solid.\"\n\n\"What of it?\"\n\n\"Why, there isn't any such substance. Nothing of the sort exists.\"\n\nCarpenter pointed to one of the windows of his laboratory.\n\n\"Does that window frame contain glass or not?\" he asked.\n\nI strained my eyes. Certainly nothing was visible.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said at a venture.\n\nHe rose and thrust his hand through the space where the glass should\nhave been.\n\n\"Has this frame glass in it?\" he asked, pointing to another.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nHe struck the glass with his knuckle.\n\n\"I'll give up,\" I replied. \"I am used to thinking of glass as being\ntransparent but not invisible; yet I can see that under certain light\nconditions it may be invisible. Granted that such is the case, do you\nbelieve that living organisms can be invisible?\"\n\n\"Under the right conditions, yes. Has any observer been able to see any\nof the purple amoeba which we know are so numerous on the outer side of\nthe heaviside layer?\"\n\n\"Not until they have entered the hole through the layer.\"\n\n\"And yet those amoeba are both solid and opaque, as you know. Why is it\nnot possible that men, or intelligences of some sort, are in the air\nabout us and yet are invisible to our eyes!\"\n\n\"If they are, why haven't we received evidence of it years ago?\"\n\n\"Because there has only been a hole through the heaviside layer for six\nyears. Before that time they could not penetrate it any more than poor\nHadley could with his space ship. They have not entered the hole earlier\nbecause it is a very small one, at present only some two hundred and\nfifty yards in diameter in a sphere of over eight thousand miles\ndiameter. The invaders have just found the entrance.\"\n\n\"The invaders? Do you think that the world has been invaded?\"\n\n\"I do. How else can you explain the very fact which you have just\nquoted, that no evidence of the presence on these invisible entities has\npreviously been recorded?\"\n\n\"Where did they come from?\"\n\n\"They may have come from anywhere in the solar system, or even from\noutside it but I fancy, that they are from Mars or Venus.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because they are the two planets nearest to the earth and are the ones\nwhere conditions are the most like they are on the earth. Venus, for\nexample, has an atmosphere and a gravity about .83 of earthly gravity,\nand life of a sort similar to that of the earth might well live there.\nFurther, it seems more probable that the invaders have come from one of\nthe nearby planets than from the realms of space beyond the solar\nsystem.\"\n\n\"What about the moon?\"\n\n\"We can dismiss that because of the lack of an atmosphere.\"\n\n\"It sounds logical, Jim, but the idea of living organisms of sufficient\nsize to lift a child into the air who are invisible seems a little\nabsurd.\"\n\n\"I never said they were invisible. I don't think they are.\"\n\n\"But they must be, else why weren't they seen?\"\n\n\"Use your head, First Mortgage. Those purple amoeba we encountered were\nquite visible to us, yet they are invisible to observers on the earth.\"\n\n\"Yes, but that is because the heaviside layer is between them and the\nearth. As soon as they come below it they can be seen.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Exactly. Why is it not possible that the Venetians, or Martians, or\nwhoever our invaders are, have encased themselves and their space flyer\nin a layer of some substance similar to the heaviside layer, a substance\nwhich is permeable to light rays only when a large proportion of\nultra-violet rays accompany the visible rays? If they did this and then\nconstructed the walls of their ship of some substance which absorbed all\nthe ultra-violet rays which fell on it; not only would the ship itself\nbe invisible, but also everything contained in it--and yet they could\nsee the outside world easily. That such _is_ the case is proved by the\ndisappearance of those children in mid-air. They were taken into a space\nship behind an ultra-violet absorbing wall and so became invisible.\"\n\n\"If the walls absorbed all the ultra-violet and were impermeable to\nlight without ultra-violet, the ship would appear as a black opaque\nsubstance and could be seen.\"\n\n\"That would be true except for one thing which you are forgetting. The\nheaviside layer, as I have repeatedly proved, is a splendid conductor of\nultra-violet. The rays falling on it are probably bent along the line of\nthe covering layer so that they open up and bend around the ship in the\nsame manner as flowing water will open up and flow around a stone and\nthen come together again. The light must flow around the solid ship and\nthen join again in such a manner that the eye can detect no\ninterruption.\"\n\n\"Jim, all that sounds reasonable, but have you any proof of it?\"\n\n\"No, First Mortgage, I haven't--yet; but if the Lord is good to us we'll\nhave definite proof this afternoon and be in a position to successfully\ncombat this new menace to the world.\"\n\n\"Do you expect me to go on another one of your crack-brained expeditions\ninto the unknown with you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Certainly I do, but this time we won't go out of the known. I have our\nold space flyer which we took beyond the heaviside layer six years ago\nready for action and we're going to look for the invaders this\nafternoon.\"\n\n\"How will we see them if they are invisible?\"\n\n\"They are invisible to ordinary light but not to ultra-violet light.\nWhile most of the ultra-violet is deflected and flows around the ship or\nelse is absorbed, I have an idea that, if we bathe it in a sufficient\nconcentration of ultra-violet, some would be reflected. We are going to\nlook for the reflected portion.\"\n\n\"Ultra-violet light is invisible.\"\n\n\"It is to the eye, but it can be detected. You know that radium is\nactivated and glows under ultra-violet?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Mounted on our flyer are six ultra-violet searchlights. By the side of\neach one is a wide angle telescopic concentrator which will focus any\nreflected ultra-violet onto a radium coated screen and thus make it\nvisible to us. In effect the apparatus is a camera obscura with all lens\nmade of rock crystal or fused quartz, both of which allow free passage\nto ultra-violet.\"\n\n\"What will we do if we find them?\"\n\n\"Mounted beneath the telescope is a one-pounder gun with radite shells.\nIf we locate them, we will use our best efforts to shoot them down.\"\n\n\"Suppose they are armed too?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"In that case I hope that you shoot faster and straighter than they do.\nIf you don't--well, old man, it'll just be too damned bad.\"\n\n\"I don't know that the _Clarion_ hires me to go out and shoot at\ninvisible invaders from another planet, but if I don't go with you, I\nexpect you'd just about call up the _Echo_ or the _Gazette_ and ask them\nfor a gunner.\"\n\n\"Just about.\"\n\n\"In that case, I may as well be sacrificed as anyone else. When do we\nstart?\"\n\n\"You old faker!\" cried Jim, pounding me on the back. \"You wouldn't miss\nthe trip for anything. If you're ready we'll start right now. Everything\nis ready.\"\n\n\"Including the sacrifice,\" I replied, rising. \"All right, Jim, let's go\nand get it over with. If we live, I'll have to get back in time to\ntelephone the story to McQuarrie for the first edition.\"\n\nI followed Jim out of the laboratory and to a large open space behind\nthe main building where the infra-red generators with which he had\npierced the hole through the heaviside layer had been located. The\nreflectors were still in place, but the bank of generators had been\nremoved. A gang of men were hard at work erecting a huge parabolic\nreflector in the center of the circle, about the periphery of which the\ninfra-red reflectors were placed. In an open space near the center stood\na Hadley space ship, toward which Jim led the way.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI wondered at the activity and meant to ask what it portended, but in\nthe excitement of boarding the flyer forgot it. I followed Jim in; he\nclosed the door and started the air conditioner.\n\n\"Here, First Mortgage,\" he said as he turned from the control board and\nfaced me, \"here are the fluoroscopic screens. They are arranged in a\nbank, so that you can keep an eye on all of them readily. Beneath each\ntelescope is an automatic one-pounder gun with its mount geared to the\ntelescope and the light, so that the gun bears continually on the point\nin space represented by the center of the fluoroscopic screen which\nbelongs to that light. If we locate anything, turn your beam until the\nobject is in the exact center of the screen where these two cross-hairs\nare. When you have it lined up, push this button and the gun will fire.\"\n\n\"What about reloading?\"\n\n\"The guns are self-loading. Each one has twenty shells in its magazine\nand will fire one shot each time the button is pushed until it is empty.\nIf you empty one magazine, I can turn the ship so that another gun will\nbear. This gives you a total of one hundred and twenty shots quickly\navailable; there are sixty extra rounds, which we can break out and load\ninto the magazines in a few seconds. Do you understand everything?\"\n\n\"I guess so. Everything seems clear enough.\"\n\n\"All right; sit down and we'll start.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI took my seat, and Jim pulled the starting lever. I was glued to the\nseat and the heavy springs in the cushion were compressed almost to\ntheir limit by the sudden acceleration. As soon as we were well clear\nof the ground Jim reduced his power, and in a few moments we were\nfloating motionless in the air, a thousand feet up. He left the control\nboard and came to my side.\n\n\"Start your ultra lights,\" he said as he joined me. \"We may be able to\nspot something from here.\"\n\nI started the lights and we stared at the screens before us. Nothing\nappeared on any of them except the one pointing directly down, and only\nan image of the ground, appeared on it. Under Jim's tutelage I swung the\nbeams in wide circles, covering the space around us, but nothing\nappeared.\n\n\"Those beams won't project over five miles in this atmosphere,\" he said,\n\"and the ship we are looking for may be so small that we would have\ntrouble locating it at any great distance. I am going to move over near\nthe scene of the last disappearance. Keep your lights swinging and sing\nout if you see anything on the screens.\"\n\nI could feel the ship start to move slowly under the force of a side\ndischarge from the rocket motor, and I swung the beams of the six lights\naround, trying to cover the entire area about us. Nothing appeared on\nthe screens for an hour, and my head began to ache from the strain of\nunremitting close observation of the glowing screens. A buzz sounding\nover the hum of the rocket motor attracted my attention; Jim pulled his\nlevers to neutral with the exception of the one which maintained our\nelevation and stepped to an instrument on the wall of the flyer.\n\n\"Hello,\" he called. \"What? Where did it happen? All right, thanks, we'll\nmove over that way at once.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned from the radio telephone and spoke.\n\n\"Another disappearance has just been reported,\" he said. \"It happened on\nthe outskirts of Pasadena. Keep your eyes open: I'm going to head in\nthat direction.\"\n\nA few minutes later we were floating over Pasadena. Jim stopped the\nflyer and joined me at the screens. We swung our beams in wide circles\nto cover the entire area around us, but no image on the screens rewarded\nus.\n\n\"Doggone it, they must have left here in a hurry,\" grumbled Jim.\n\nEven as he spoke the flyer gave a lurch which nearly threw me off my\nseat and which sent Jim sprawling on the floor. With a white face he\nleaped to the control board and pulled the lever controlling our one\nworking stern motor to full power. For a moment the ship moved upward\nand then came to a dead stop, although the motor still roared at full\nspeed.\n\n\"Can't you see anything, Pete?\" cried Jim as he threw our second stern\nmotor into gear.\n\nAgain the ship moved upward for a few feet and then stopped. I swung the\nsearchlights frantically in all directions, but five of the screens\nremained blank and the sixth showed only the ground below us.\n\n\"Not a thing,\" I replied.\n\n\"Something ought to show,\" he muttered, and suddenly shut off both\nmotors. The flyer gave a sickening lurch toward the ground, but we fell\nonly a hundred yards before our motion stopped. We hung suspended in the\nair with no motors working. Jim joined me at the screens and we swung\nthe lights rapidly without success.\n\n\"Look, Pete!\" Jim cried hoarsely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy gaze followed his pointing finger and I saw the door of our flyer\nspringing out as though some force from the outside were trying to\nwrench it open. The pull ceased for an instant, then came again; the\nsturdy latches burst and the door was torn from its hinges. Jim swung\none of the searchlights until the beam was at right angles to the hull\nof the flyer and pressed the gun button. A crash filled the confined\nspace of the flyer as a one-pounder radite shell tore out into space.\n\n\"They're there but still invisible,\" he exclaimed as he shifted the\ndirection of the gun and fired again. \"I am shooting by guess-work, but\nI might score a hit.\"\n\nHe changed the direction of the gun again, but before he could press the\nbutton he was lifted into the air and drawn rapidly toward the open\ndoor.\n\n\"Shoot, Pete!\" he shouted. \"Shoot and keep on shooting--it's your only\nchance!\"\n\nI turned to the knobs controlling the guns and lights, but, before I\ncould make a move, something hard and cold grasped me about the middle\nand I was lifted into the air and drawn toward the open door after Jim.\nI tore at the thing holding me with my hands, but it was a smooth round\nthing like a two-inch thick wire, and I could get no grip on it to\nloosen it. Out through the door I went and was drawn through the air a\nfew feet behind Jim. He moved ahead of me for fifteen or twenty feet and\nthen vanished in mid-air. I dared not struggle in mid-air and I was\ndrawn through a door into a large space flyer which became visible as I\nentered it. The flexible wire or rod which had held me uncoiled and I\nwas free on the floor beside Jim Carpenter. This much was clear and\nunderstandable, but when I looked at the crew of that space ship, I was\nsure that I had lost my mind or was seeing visions. I had naturally\nexpected men, or at least something in semi-human form, but instead of\nanything of the sort, before me stood a dozen gigantic beetles!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI rubbed my eyes and looked again. There was no mistaking the fact that\nwe had been captured by a race of gigantic beetles flying an invisible\nspace ship. When I had time later to examine them critically, I could\nsee marked differences between our captors and the beetles we were\naccustomed to see on the earth besides the mere matter of size. To begin\nwith, their bodies were relatively much smaller, the length of shell of\nthe largest specimen not being over four feet, while the head of the\nsame insect, exclusive of the horns or pinchers, was a good eighteen\ninches in length. The pinchers, which by all beetle proportions should\nhave been a couple of feet long at the least, did not extend over the\nhead a distance greater than eight inches, although they were sturdy and\npowerful.\n\nInstead of traveling with their shells horizontal as do earthly beetles,\nthese insects stood erect on their two lower pairs of legs, which were\nof different lengths so that all four feet touched the ground when the\nshell was vertical. The two upper pairs of legs were used as arms, the\ntopmost pair[A] being quite short and splitting out at the end into four\nflexible claws about five inches long, which they used as fingers. These\nupper arms, which sprouted from a point near the top of the head, were\npeculiar in that they apparently had no joints like the other three\npairs but were flexible like an elephant's trunk. The second pair of\narms were armed with long, vicious-looking hooks. The backplates\nconcealed only very rudimentary wings, not large enough to enable the\ninsects to fly, although Jim told me later that they could fly on their\nown planet, where the lessened gravity made such extensive wing supports\nas would be needed on earth unnecessary.\n\n[Footnote A: Mr. Bond has made a laughable error in his description.\nLike all of the coleoptera, the Mercurians were hexapoda (six legged).\nWhat Mr. Bond continually refers to in his narrative as \"upper arms\"\nwere really the antenna of the insects which split at the end into four\nflexible appendages resembling fingers. His mistake is a natural one,\nfor the Mercurians used their antenna as extra arms.--James S.\nCarpenter.]\n\nThe backplates were a brilliant green in color, with six-inch stripes of\nchrome yellow running lengthwise and crimson spots three inches in\ndiameter arranged in rows between the stripes. Their huge-faceted eyes\nsparkled like crystal when the light fell on them, and from time to time\nwaves of various colors passed over them, evidently reflecting the\ninsect's emotions. Although they gave the impression of great muscular\npower, their movements were slow and sluggish, and they seemed to have\ndifficulty in getting around.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs my horrified gaze took in these monstrosities I turned with a shudder\nto Jim Carpenter.\n\n\"Am I crazy, Jim,\" I asked, \"or do you see these things too?\"\n\n\"I see them all right, Pete,\" he replied. \"It isn't as surprising as it\nseems at first glance. You expected to find human beings; so did I, but\nwhat reason had we for doing so? It is highly improbable, when you come\nto consider the matter, that evolution should take the same course\nelsewhere as it did on earth. Why not beetles, or fish, or horned toads,\nfor that matter?\"\n\n\"No reason, I guess,\" I answered; \"I just hadn't expected anything of\nthe sort. What do you suppose they mean to do with us?\"\n\n\"I haven't any idea, old man. We'll just have to wait and see. I'll try\nto talk to them, although I don't expect much luck at it.\"\n\nHe turned to the nearest beetle and slowly and clearly spoke a few\nwords. The insect gave no signs of comprehension, although it watched\nthe movement of Jim's lips carefully. It is my opinion, and Jim agrees\nwith me, that the insects were both deaf and dumb, for during the entire\ntime we were associated with them, we never heard them give forth a\nsound under any circumstances, nor saw them react to any sound that we\nmade. Either they had some telepathic means of communication or else\nthey made and heard sounds beyond the range of the human ear, for it was\nevident from their actions that they frequently communicated with one\nanother.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Jim failed in his first attempt to communicate he looked around for\nanother method. He noticed my notebook, which had fallen on the floor\nwhen I was set down; he picked it up and drew a pencil from his pocket.\nThe insects watched his movements carefully, and when he had made a\nsketch in the book, the nearest one took it from him and examined it\ncarefully and then passed it to another one, who also examined it. The\nsketch which Jim had drawn showed the outline of the Hadley space flyer\nfrom which he had been taken. When the beetles had examined the sketch,\none of them stepped to an instrument board in the center of the ship and\nmade an adjustment. Then he pointed with one of his lower arms.\n\nWe looked in the direction in which he pointed; to our astonishment, the\nwalls of the flyer seemed to dissolve, or at least to become perfectly\ntransparent. The floor of the space ship was composed of some silvery\nmetal, and from it had risen walls of the same material, but now the\neffect was as though we were suspended in mid-air, with nothing either\naround us or under us. I gasped and grabbed at the instrument board for\nsupport. Then I felt foolish as I realized that there was no change in\nthe feel of the floor for all its transparency and that we were not\nfalling.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA short distance away we could see our flyer suspended in the air, held\nup by two long flexible rods or wires similar to those which had lifted\nus from our ship into our prison. I saw a dozen more of these rods\ncoiled up, hanging in the air, evidently, but really on the floor near\nthe edge of the flyer, ready for use. Jim suddenly grasped me by the\narm.\n\n\"Look behind you in a moment,\" he said, \"but don't start!\"\n\nHe took the notebook in his hand and started to draw a sketch. I looked\nbehind as he had told me to. Hanging in the air in a position which told\nme that they must have been in a different compartment of the flyer,\nwere five children. They were white as marble, and lay perfectly\nmotionless.\n\n\"Are they dead, Jim?\" I asked in a low voice without looking at him.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he replied, \"but we'll find out a little later. I am\nrelieved to find them here, and I doubt if they are harmed.\"\n\nThe sketch which he was making was one of the solar system, and, when he\nhad finished, he marked the earth with a cross and handed the notebook\nto one of the beetles. The insect took it and showed it to his\ncompanions; so far as I was able to judge expressions, they were amazed\nto find that we had knowledge of the heavenly bodies. The beetle took\nJim's pencil in one of its hands and, after examining it carefully, made\na cross on the circle which Jim had drawn to represent the planet\nMercury.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"They come from Mercury,\" exclaimed Jim in surprise as he showed me the\nsketch. \"That accounts for a good many things; why they are so\nlethargic, for one thing. Mercury is much smaller than the earth and the\ngravity is much less. According to Mercurian standards, they must weigh\na ton each. It is quite a tribute to their muscular development that\nthey can move and support their weight against our gravity. They can\nunderstand a drawing all right, so we have a means of communicating with\nthem, although a pretty slow one and dependent entirely on my limited\nskill as a cartoonist. I wonder if we are free to move about?\"\n\n\"The only way to find out is to try,\" I replied and stood erect. The\nbeetles offered no objection and Jim stood up beside me. We walked, or\nrather edged, our way toward the side of the ship. The insects watched\nus when we started to move and then evidently decided that we were\nharmless. They turned from us to the working of the ship. One of them\nmanipulated some dials on the instrument board. One of the rods which\nheld our flyer released its grip, came in toward the Mercurian ship and\ncoiled itself up on the floor, or the place where the floor should have\nbeen. The insect touched another dial. Jim threw caution to the winds,\nraced across the floor and grasped the beetle by the arm.\n\nThe insect looked at him questioningly; Jim produced the notebook and\ndrew a sketch representing our flyer falling. On the level be had used\nto represent the ground he made another sketch of it lying in ruins. The\nbeetle nodded comprehendingly and turned to another dial; the ship sank\nslowly toward the ground.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe sank until we hung only a few feet from the ground when our flyer was\ngently lowered down. When it rested on the ground, the wire which had\nheld it uncoiled, came aboard and coiled itself up beside the others. As\nthe Mercurian ship rose I noticed idly that the door which had been torn\nfrom our ship and dropped lay within a few yards of the ship itself. The\nMercurian ship rose to an elevation of a hundred feet, drifting gently\nover the city.\n\nAs we rose I determined to try the effect of my personality on the\nbeetles. I approached the one who seemed to be the leader and, putting\non the most woeful expression I could muster, I looked at the floor. He\ndid not understand me and I pretended that I was falling and grasped at\nhim. This time he nodded and stepped to the instrument board. In a\nmoment the floor became visible. I thanked him as best I could in\npantomime and approached the walls. They were so transparent that I felt\nan involuntary shrinking as I approached them. I edged my way cautiously\nforward until my outstretched hand encountered a solid substance. I\nlooked out.\n\nAt the slow speed we were traveling the drone of our motors was hardly\naudible to us, and I felt sure that it could not be heard on the ground.\nOnce their curiosity was satisfied, our captors paid little or no\nattention to me and left me free to come and go as I wished. I made my\nway cautiously toward the children, but ran into a solid wall.\nRemembering Jim's words, I made my way back toward him without\ndisplaying any interest.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJim could probably have wandered around as I did had he wished, but he\nchose to occupy his time differently. With his notebook and pencil he\ncarried on an extensive conversation, if that term can be applied to a\ncrudely executed set of drawings, with the leader of the beetles. I was\nnot especially familiar with the methods of control of space ships and I\ncould make nothing of the maze of dials and switches on the instrument\nboard.\n\nFor half an hour we drifted slowly along. Presently one of the beetles\napproached, seized my arm and turned me about. With one of his arms he\npointed ahead. A mile away I could see another space flyer similar to\nthe one we were on.\n\n\"Here comes another one, Jim.\" I called.\n\n\"Yes, I saw it some time ago. I don't know where the third one is.\"\n\n\"Are there three of them?\"\n\n\"Yes. Three of them came here yesterday and are exploring the country\nround about here. They are scouts sent out from the fleet of our brother\nplanet to see if the road was clear and what the world was like. They\nspotted the hole through the layer with their telescope and sent their\nfleet out to pay us a visit. He tells me that the scouts have reported\nfavorably and that the whole fleet, several thousand ships, as near as I\ncan make out, are expected here this evening.\"\n\n\"Have you solved the secret of their invisibility?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Partly. It is as I expected. The walls of the ship are double, the\ninner one of metal and the outer one of vitrolene or some similar\nperfectly transparent substance. The space between the walls is filled\nwith some substance which will bend both visible and ultra-violet rays\nalong a path around the ship and then lets them go in their original\ndirection. The reason why we can see through the walls and see the\nprotective coating of that ship coming is that they are generating some\nsort of a ray here which acts as a carrier for the visible light rays. I\ndon't know what sort of a ray it is, but when I get a good look at their\ngenerators, I may be able to tell. Are you beginning to itch and burn?\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe that I am, although I hadn't noticed it until you\nspoke.\"\n\n\"I have been noticing it for some time. From its effects on the skin, I\nam inclined to believe it to be a ray of very short wave-length,\npossibly something like our X-ray, or even shorter.\"\n\n\"Have you found out what they intend to do with us?\"\n\n\"I don't think they have decided yet. Possibly they are going to take us\nup to the leader of their fleet and let him decide. The cuss that is in\ncommand of this ship seems surprised to death to find out that I can\ncomprehend the principles of his ship. He seems to think that I am a\nsort of a rara avis, a freak of nature. He intimated that he would\nrecommend that we be used for vivisection.\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\"\n\n\"It's not much more worse than the fate they design for the rest of\ntheir captives, at that.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"It's a long story that I'll have to tell you later. I want to watch\nthis meeting.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe other ship had approached to within a few yards and floated\nstationary, while some sort of communication was exchanged between the\ntwo. I could not fathom the method used, but the commander of our craft\nclamped what looked like a pair of headphones against his body and\nplugged the end of a wire leading from them into his instrument board.\nFrom time to time various colored lights glowed on the board before\nhim. After a time he uncoupled his device from the board, and one of the\nlong rods shot out from our ship to the other. It returned in a moment\nclamped around the body of a young girl. As the came on board, she was\nlowered onto the deck beside the other children. Like them, she was\nstiff and motionless. I gave an exclamation and sprang forward.\n\n\"Pete!\"\n\nJim's voice recalled me to myself, and I watched the child laid with the\nothers with as disinterested an expression as I could muster. I had\nnever made a mistake in following Jim Carpenter's lead and I knew that\nsomewhere in his head a plan was maturing which might offer us some\nchance of escape.\n\nOur ship moved ahead down a long slant, gradually dropping nearer to the\nground. I watched the maneuver with interest while Jim, with his friend\nthe beetle commander, went over the ship. The insect was evidently\namused at Jim and was determined to find out the limits of his\nintelligence, for he pointed out various controls and motors of the ship\nand made elaborate sketches which Jim seemed to comprehend fairly well.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the beetles approached the control board and motioned me back. I\nstepped away from the board; evidently a port in the side of the vessel\nopened, for I felt a breath of air and could hear the hum of the city. I\nwalked to the side and glanced down, and found that we were floating\nabout twenty feet off the ground over a street on the edge of the city.\nOn the street a short distance ahead of us two children, evidently\nreturning from school, to judge by the books under their arms, were\nwalking unsuspectingly along. A turn of the dial sped up our motors, and\nas the hum rang out in a louder key the children looked upward. Two of\nthe long flexible wires shot out and wrapped themselves about the\nchildren; screaming, they were lifted into the space flyer. The port\nthrough which they came in shut with a clang and the ship rose rapidly\ninto the air. The children were released from the wires which coiled\nthemselves up on deck and the beetle who had operated them stepped\nforward and grasped the nearer of the children, a boy of about eleven,\nby the arm. He raised the boy, who was paralyzed with terror, up toward\nhis head and gazed steadily into his eyes. Slowly the boy ceased\nstruggling and became white and rigid. The beetle laid him on the deck\nand turned to the girl. Involuntarily I gave a shout and sprang forward,\nbut Jim grasped me by the arm.\n\n\"Keep quiet, you darned fool!\" he cried. \"We can do nothing now. Wait\nfor a chance!\"\n\n\"We can't stand here and see murder done!\" I protested.\n\n\"It's not murder. Pete, those children aren't being hurt. They are being\nhypnotized so that they can be transported to Mercury.\"\n\n\"Why are they taking them to Mercury?\" I demanded.\n\n\"As nearly as I can make out, there is a race of men up there who are\nsubject to these beetles. This ship is radium propelled, and the men and\nwomen are the slaves who work in the radium mines. Of course the workers\nsoon become sexless, but others are kept for breeding purposes to keep\nthe race alive. Through generations of in-breeding, the stock is about\nplayed out and are getting too weak to be of much value.\n\n\"The Mercurians have been studying the whole universe to find a race\nwhich will serve their purpose and they have chosen us to be the\nvictims. When their fleet gets here, they plan to capture thousands of\nselected children and carry them to Mercury in order to infuse their\nblood into the decadent race of slaves they have. Those who are not\nsuitable for breeding when they grow up will die as slaves in the radium\nmines.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Horrible!\" I gasped. \"Why are they taking children, Jim? Wouldn't\nadults suit their purpose better?\"\n\n\"They are afraid to take adults. On Mercury an earthman would have\nmuscles of unheard of power and adults would constantly strive to rise\nagainst their masters. By getting children, they hope to raise them to\nknow nothing else than a life of slavery and get the advantage of their\nstrength without risk. It is a clever scheme.\"\n\n\"And are we to stand here and let them do it?\"\n\n\"Not on your life, but we had better hold easy for a while. If I can get\na few minutes more with that brute I'll know enough about running this\nship that we can afford to do away with them. You have a pistol, haven't\nyou?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"The devil! I thought you had. I have an automatic, but it only carries\neight shells. There are eleven of these insects and unless we can get\nthe jump on them, they'll do us. I saw what looks like a knife lying\nnear the instrument board; get over near it and get ready to grab it as\nsoon as you hear my pistol. These things are deaf and if I work it right\nI may be able to do several of them in before they know what's\nhappening. When you attack, don't try to ram them in the back; their\nbackplates are an inch thick and will be proof against a knife thrust.\nAim at their eyes; if you can blind them, they'll be helpless. Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"I'll do my best, Jim,\" I replied. \"Since you have told me their plans I\nam itching to get at them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI edged over toward the knife, but as I did so I saw a better weapon. On\nthe floor lay a bar of silvery metal about thirty inches long and an\ninch in diameter. I picked it up and toyed with it idly, meanwhile\nedging around to get behind the insect which I had marked for my first\nattentions. Jim was talking again by means of the notebook with his\nbeetle friend. They walked around the ship, examining everything in it.\n\n\"Are you ready, Pete?\" came Jim's voice at last.\n\n\"All set,\" I replied, getting a firmer grasp on my bar and edging toward\none of the insects.\n\n\"Well, don't start until I fire. You notice the bug I am talking to?\nDon't kill him unless you have to. This ship is a little too complicated\nfor me to fathom, so I want this fellow taken prisoner. We'll use him as\nour engineer when we take control.\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\n\"All right, get ready.\"\n\nI kept my eye on Jim. He had drawn the beetle with whom he was talking\nto a position where they were behind the rest. Jim pointed at something\nbehind the insect's back and the beetle turned. As it did so, Jim\nwhipped out his pistol and, taking careful aim, fired at one of the\ninsects.\n\nAs the sound of the shot rang out I raised my bar and leaped forward. I\nbrought it down with crushing force on the head of the nearest beetle.\nMy victim fell forward, and I heard Jim's pistol bark again; but I had\nno time to watch him. As the beetle I struck fell the others turned and\nI had two of them coming at me with outstretched arms, ready to grasp\nme. I swung my bar, and the arm of one of them fell limp; but the other\nseized me with both its hands, and I felt the cruel hooks of its lower\narms against the small of my back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of my arms was still free; I swung my bar again, and it struck my\ncaptor on the back of the head. It was stunned by the blow and fell. I\nseized the knife from the floor, and threw myself down beside it and\nstruck at its eyes, trying to roll it over so as to protect me from the\nother who was trying to grasp me.\n\nI felt hands clutch me from behind; I was wrenched loose from the body\nof my victim and lifted into the air. I was turned about and stared\nhard into the implacable crystalline eyes of one of the insects. For a\nmoment my senses reeled and then, without volition, I dropped my bar. I\nremembered the children and realized that I was being hypnotized. I\nfought against the feeling, but my senses reeled and I almost went limp,\nwhen the sound of a pistol shot, almost in my ear, roused me. The spell\nof the beetle was momentarily broken. I thrust the knife which I still\ngrasped at the eyes before me. My blow went home, but the insect raised\nme and bent me toward him until my head lay on top of his and the huge\nhorns which adorned his head began to close. Another pistol shot\nsounded, and I was suddenly dropped.\n\nI grasped my bar as I fell and leaped up. The flyer was a shambles. Dead\ninsects lay on all sides while Jim, smoking pistol in hand, was staring\nas though fascinated into the eyes of one of the surviving beetles. I\nran forward and brought my bar down on the insect's head, but as I did\nso I was grasped from behind.\n\n\"Jim, help!\" I cried as I was swung into the air. The insect whirled me\naround and then threw me to the floor. I had an impression of falling;\nthen everything dissolved in a flash of light. I was unconscious only\nfor a moment, and I came to to find Jim Carpenter standing over me,\nmenacing my assailant with his gun.\n\n\"Thanks, Jim,\" I said faintly.\n\n\"If you're conscious again, get up and get your bar,\" he replied. \"My\npistol is empty and I don't know how long I can run a bluff on this\nfellow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI scrambled to my feet and grasped the bar. Jim stepped behind me and\nreloaded his pistol.\n\n\"All right,\" he said when he had finished. \"I'll take charge of this\nfellow. Go around and see if the rest are dead. If they aren't when you\nfind them, see that they are when you leave them. We're taking no\nprisoners.\"\n\nI went the rounds of the prostrate insects. None of them were beyond\nmoving except two whose heads had been crushed by my bar, but I obeyed\nJim's orders. When I rejoined him with my bloody bar, the only beetle\nleft alive was the commander, whom Jim was covering with his pistol.\n\n\"Take the gun,\" he said when I reported my actions, \"and give me the\nbar.\"\n\nWe exchanged weapons and Jim turned to the captive.\n\n\"Now, old fellow,\" he said grimly, \"either you run this ship as I want\nyou to, or you're a dead Indian. Savvy?\"\n\nHe took his pencil and notebook from his pocket and drew a sketch of our\nHadley space ship. On the other end of the sheet he drew a picture of\nthe Mercurian ship, and then drew a line connecting the two. The insect\nlooked at the sketch but made no movement.\n\n\"All right, if that's the way you feel about it,\" said Jim. He raised\nthe bar and brought it down with crushing force on one of the insect's\nlower arms. The arm fell as though paralyzed and a blue light played\nacross the beetle's eyes. Jim extended the sketch again and raised the\nbar threateningly. The beetle moved over to the control board, Jim\nfollowing closely, and set the ship in motion. Ten minutes later it\nrested on the ground beside the ship in which we had first taken the\nair.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFollowing Jim's pictured orders the beetle opened the door of the\nMercurian ship and followed Jim into the Hadley. As we emerged from the\nMercurian ship I looked back. It had vanished completely.\n\n\"The children, Jim!\" I gasped.\n\n\"I haven't forgotten them,\" he replied, \"but they are all right for the\npresent. If we turned them loose now, we'd have ninety reporters around\nus in ten minutes. I want to get our generators modified first.\"\n\nHe pointed toward the spot where the Mercurian ship had stood and then\ntoward our generators. The beetle hesitated, but Jim swung his bar\nagainst the insect's side in a vicious blow. Again came the play of blue\nlight over the eyes; the beetle bent over our generaters and set to\nwork. Jim handed me the bar and bent over to help. They were both\nmechanics of a high order and they worked well together; in an hour the\nbeetle started the generators and swung one of the searchlights toward\nhis old ship. It leaped into view on the radium coated screen.\n\n\"Good business!\" ejaculated Jim. \"We'll repair this door; then we'll be\nready to release the children and start out.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe followed the beetle into the Mercurian ship, which it seemed to be\nable to see. It opened a door leading into another compartment of the\nflyer, and before us lay the bodies of eight children. The beetle lifted\nthe first one, a little girl, up until his many-faceted eyes looked full\ninto the closed ones of the child. There was a flicker of an eyelash, a\ntrace of returning color, and then a scream of terror from the child.\nThe beetle set the girl down and Jim bent over her.\n\n\"It's all right now, little lady,\" he said, clumsily smoothing her hair.\n\n\"You're safe now. Run along to your mother. First Mortgage, take charge\nof her and take her outside. It isn't well for children to see these\nthings.\"\n\nThe child clung to my hand: I led her out of the ship, which promptly\nvanished as we left it. One by one, seven other children joined us, the\nlast one, a miss of not over eight, in Jim's arms. The beetle followed\nbehind him.\n\n\"Do any of you know where you are?\" asked Jim as he came out.\n\n\"I do, sir,\" said one of the boys. \"I live close to here.\"\n\n\"All right, take these youngsters to your house and tell your mother to\ntelephone their parents to come and get them. If anyone asks you what\nhappened, tell them to see Jim Carpenter to-morrow. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"All right, run along then. Now, First Mortgage, let's go hunting.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe wired our captive up so securely that I felt that there was no\npossible chance of his escape; then, with Jim at the controls and me at\nthe guns, we fared forth in search of the invaders. Back and forth over\nthe city we flew without sighting another spaceship in the air. Jim gave\nan exclamation of impatience and swung on a wider circle, which took us\nout over the water. I kept the searchlights working. Presently, far\nahead over the water, a dark spot came into view. I called to Jim and we\napproached it at top speed.\n\n\"Don't shoot until we are within four hundred yards,\" cautioned Jim.\n\nI held my fire until we were within the specified distance. The newcomer\nwas another of the Mercurian space-ships; with a feeling of joy I swung\nmy beam until the cross-hairs of the screen rested full on the invader.\n\n\"All ready!\" I sung out.\n\n\"If you are ready, Gridley, you may fire!\" replied Jim. I pressed the\ngun button. The crash of the gun was followed by another report from\noutside as the radite shell burst against the Mercurian flyer. The\ndeadly explosive did its work, and the shattered remains of the wreck\nfell, to be engulfed in the sea below.\n\n\"That's one!\" cried Jim. \"I'm afraid we won't have time to hunt up the\nother right now. This bug told me that the other Mercurians are due here\nto-day, and I think we had better form ourselves into a reception\ncommittee and go up to the hole to meet them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe sent the ship at high speed over the city until we hovered over the\nlaboratory. We stopped for a moment, and Jim stepped to the radio\ntelephone.\n\n\"Hello, Williams,\" he said, \"how are things going? That's fine. In an\nhour, you say? Well, speed it up as much as you can; we may call for it\nsoon.\"\n\nHe turned both stern motors to full power, and we shot up like a rocket\ntoward the hole in the protective layer through which the invaders had\nentered. In ten minutes we were at the altitude of the guard ships and\nJim asked if anything had been seen. The report was negative; Jim left\nthem below the layer and sent our flyer up through the hole into space.\nWe reached the outer surface in another ten minutes and we were none too\nsoon. Hardly had we debouched from the hole than ahead of us we saw\nanother Mercurian flyer. It was a lone one, and Jim bent over the\ncaptive and held a hastily made sketch before him. The sketch showed\nthree Mercurian flyers, one on the ground, one wrecked and the third one\nin the air. He touched the drawing of the one in the air and pointed\ntoward our port hole and looked questioningly at the beetle. The insect\ninspected the flyer in space and nodded.\n\n\"Good!\" cried Jim. \"That's the third of the trio who came ahead as\nscouts. Get your gun ready, First Mortgage: we're going to pick him\noff.\"\n\nOur ship approached the doomed Mercurian. Again I waited until we were\nwithin four hundred yards; then I pressed the button which hurled it, a\ncrumpled wreck, onto the outer surface of the heaviside layer.\n\n\"Two!\" cried Jim as we backed away.\n\n\"Here come plenty more,\" I cried as I swung the searchlight. Jim left\nhis controls, glanced at the screen and whistled softly. Dropping toward\nus from space were hundreds of the Mercurian ships.\n\n\"We got here just in time,\" he said. \"Break out your extra ammunition\nwhile I take to the hole. We can't hope to do that bunch alone, so we'll\nfight a rearguard action.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSince our bow gun would be the only one in action, I hastily moved the\nspare boxes of ammunition nearer to it while Jim maneuvered the Hadley\nover the hole. As the Mercurian fleet came nearer he started a slow\nretreat toward the earth. The Mercurians overtook us rapidly; Jim locked\nhis controls at slow speed down and hurried to the bow gun.\n\n\"Start shooting as soon as you can,\" he said. \"I'll keep the magazine\nfilled.\"\n\nI swung the gun until the cross-hairs of the screen rested full on the\nleading ship and pressed the button. My aim was true, and the shattered\nfragments of the ship fell toward me. The balance of the fleet slowed\ndown for an instant; I covered another one and pressed my button. The\nship at which I had aimed was in motion and I missed it, but I had the\nsatisfaction of seeing another one fall in fragments. Jim was loading\nthe magazine as fast as I fired. I covered another ship and fired again.\nA third one of our enemies fell in ruins. The rest paused and drew off.\n\n\"They're retreating, Jim!\" I cried.\n\n\"Cease firing until they come on again,\" he replied is he took the\nshells from the magazines of the other guns and piled them near the bow\ngun.\n\nI held my fire for a few minutes. The Mercurians retreated a short\ndistance and then came on again with a rush. Twenty times my gun went\noff as fast as I could align it and press the trigger, and eighteen of\nthe enemy ships were in ruins. Again the Mercurians retreated. I held my\nfire. We were falling more rapidly now and far below we could see the\nblack spots which were the guard ships. I told Jim that they were in\nsight; he stepped to the radio telephone and ordered them to keep well\naway from the hole.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain the Mercurian ships came on with a rush, this time with beams of\norange light stabbing a way before them. When I told Jim of this he\njumped to the controls and shot our ship down at breakneck speed.\n\n\"I don't know what sort of fighting apparatus they have, but I don't\ncare to face it,\" he said to me. \"Fire if they get close; but I hope to\nget out of the hole before they are in range.\"\n\nFast as we fell, the Mercurians were coming faster, and they were not\nover eight hundred yards from us when he reached the level of the guard\nships. Jim checked our speed; I managed to pick off three more of the\ninvaders before we moved away from the hole. Jim stopped the side motion\nand jumped to the radio telephone.\n\n\"Hello, Williams!\" he shouted into the instrument. \"Are you ready down\nthere? Thank God! Full power at once, please!\n\n\"Watch what happens,\" he said to me, as he turned from the instrument.\n\nSome fifty of the Mercurian flyers had reached our level and had started\nto move toward us before anything happened. Then from below came a beam\nof intolerable light. Upward it struck, and the Mercurian ships on which\nit impinged disappeared in a flash of light.\n\n\"A disintegrating ray,\" explained Jim. \"I suspected that it might be\nneeded and I started Williams to rigging it up early this morning. I\nhated to use it because it may easily undo the work that six years have\ndone in healing the break in the layer, but it was necessary. That ends\nthe invasion, except for those ten or twelve ships ahead of us. How is\nyour marksmanship? Can you pick off ten in ten shots?\"\n\n\"Watch me,\" I said grimly as the ship started to move.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPride goeth ever before a fall: it took me sixteen shots to demolish the\neleven ships which had escaped destruction from the ray. As the last one\nfell in ruins, Jim ordered the ray shut off. We fell toward the ground.\n\n\"What are we going to do with our prisoner?\" I asked.\n\nJim looked at the beetle meditatively.\n\n\"He would make a fine museum piece if he were stuffed,\" he said, \"but\non the whole, I think we'll let him go. He is an intelligent creature\nand will probably be happier on Mercury than anywhere else. What do you\nsay that we put him on his ship and turn him loose?\"\n\n\"To lead another invasion?\" I asked.\n\n\"I think not. He has seen what has happened to this one and is more\nlikely to warn them to keep away. In any event, if we equip the guard\nships with a ray that will show the Mercurian ships up and keep the\ndisintegrating ray ready for action, we needn't fear another invasion.\nLet's let him go.\"\n\n\"It suits me all right, Jim, but I hold out for one thing. I will never\ndare to face McQuarrie again if I fail to get a picture of him. I insist\non taking his photograph before we turn him loose.\"\n\n\"All right, go ahead,\" laughed Jim. \"He ought to be able to stand that,\nif you'll spare him an interview.\"\n\nAn hour later we watched the Mercurian flyer disappear into space.\n\n\"I hope I've seen the last of those bugs,\" I said as the flyer faded\nfrom view.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Jim thoughtfully. \"If I have interpreted correctly\nthe drawings that creature made, there is a race of manlike bipeds on\nMercury who are slaves to those beetles and who live and die in the\nhorrible atmosphere of a radium mine. Some of these days I may lead an\nexpedition to our sister planet and look into that matter.\"\n\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL VOICES FOR PHONE NUMBERS\n\n\n     New developments whereby science goes still farther in its\n     assumption of human attributes were described and demonstrated\n     recently by Sergius P. Grace, Assistant Vice-President of Bell\n     Telephone Laboratories, where the developments were conceived and\n     worked out.\n\n     One development described, and soon to be put into service in New\n     York, transforms a telephone number dialed by a subscriber into\n     speech. Although the subscriber says not a word the number dialed\n     is spoken aloud to the operator.\n\n     The device is expected to simplify and speed the hooking together\n     of automatic and voice-hand-operated telephone exchanges, and also\n     to speed long-distance calls from automatic phones through rural\n     exchanges.\n\n     The numbers which can thus be spoken are recorded on talkie films\n     and those which are to go into use here have already been made, all\n     by an Irish girl said to have the best voice among the city's\n     \"number, please\" girls.\n\n     Mr. Grace demonstrated this device by carrying into the audience a\n     telephone with a long cord connected with a loud speaker on the\n     stand, which represented central. A member of the audience was\n     requested to dial a number, and choose 5551-T, the letter T\n     representing the exchange.\n\n     This number the spectator dialed on the phone Mr. Grace carried.\n     There was no sound but the clicking of the dial. Then, two seconds\n     later, the loudspeaker spoke up clearly, in an almost human voice,\n     \"5551 T.\"\n\n     As for the recording of the sound films, there is a film for each\n     of the ten Arabic numerals from zero to nine, and these wound on\n     revolving drums. The dial on the telephone automatically sets in\n     action the drum corresponding to the numeral moved on the dial.\n\n     Another development which sounds promising for bashful suitors and\n     other timid souls, enables a person to store within himself\n     electrically a message he desires to deliver and then to deliver it\n     without speaking, simply by putting a finger to the ear of the\n     person for whom the message is intended.\n\n     This Mr. Grace demonstrated. He spoke into a telephone transmitter\n     and his words were clearly heard by all in the audience, by means\n     of amplifiers. At the same time a part of the electrical current\n     from the amplifier, representing the sentence he voiced, was stored\n     in a \"delay circuit,\" another recent invention of the laboratories.\n     After being stored four and a half seconds this current was\n     transformed to a high voltage and passed into Mr. Grace's body. He\n     then put his finger against the ear of a member of the audience,\n     who heard in his brain the same sentence. The ear drum and\n     surrounding tissues are made to act as one plate of a\n     condenser-receiver, Mr. Grace explained, with the vibrations of the\n     drum interpreted by the brain.\n\n     A new magnetic metal, \"perminvar,\" and a new insulating material,\n     \"para gutta,\" which make possible construction of a telephone cable\n     across the Atlantic to supplement the radio systems, were also\n     described. Actual construction of the cable is expected to be\n     started in 1930, Mr. Grace said.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: _The flight was hovering above the first fire-ball._]\n\nEarth, the Marauder\n\nCONCLUSION OF A THREE-PART NOVEL\n\n_By Arthur J. Burks_\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n_Desolation_\n\n\nStranger, more thrilling even than had been the flight of the Earth\nafter being forced out of its orbit, was the flight of those dozen\naircars of the Moon, bearing the rebels of Dalis' Gens back to Earth.\n\n[Sidenote: Martian fire-balls and the terrific Moon-cubes wreak\ntremendous destruction on helpless Earth in the final death struggle of\nthe warring worlds.]\n\nFor the light which glowed from the bodies of the rebels, which had been\ngiven them by their passage through the white flames, was transmitted to\nthe cars themselves, so that they glowed as with an inner radiance of\ntheir own--like comets flashing across the night.\n\nStrange alchemy, which Sarka wondered about and, wondering, looked ahead\nto the time when he should be able, within his laboratory, to analyze\nthe force it embodied, and thus gain new scientific knowledge of untold\nvalue to people of the Earth.\n\nAs the cars raced across outer darkness, moving at top speed, greater\nthan ever attained before by man, greater than even these mighty cars\nhad traveled, Sarka looked ahead, and wondered about the fearful report\nhis father had just given him.\n\nThat there was an alliance between Mars and the Moon seemed almost\nunbelievable. How had they managed the first contact, the first\nnegotiations leading to the compact between two such alien peoples? Had\nthere been any flights exchanged by the two worlds, surely the\nscientists of Earth would have known about it. But there had not, though\nthere had been times and times when Sarka had peered closely enough at\nthe surface of both the Moon and of Mars to see the activities, or the\nresults of the activities, of the peoples of the two worlds.\n\nSomehow, however, communication, if Sarka the Second had guessed\ncorrectly, had been managed between Mars and the Moon; and now that the\nEarth was a free flying orb the two were in alliance against it, perhaps\nfor the same reason that the Earth had gone a-voyaging.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSide by side sat Sarka and Jaska, their eager eyes peering through the\nforward end of the flashing aircar toward the Earth, growing minute by\nminute larger. They were able, after some hours, to make out the\noutlines of what had once been continents, to see the shadows in valleys\nwhich had once held the oceans of Earth....\n\nAnd always, as they stared and literally willed the cubes which piloted\nand were the motive power of the aircars to speed and more speed, that\nmarvelous display of interplanetary fireworks which had aroused the\nconcern of Sarka the Second.\n\nWhat were those lights? Whence did they emanate? Sarka the Second had\nsaid that they came from Mars, yet Mars was invisible to those in the\nspeeding aircars, which argued that it was hidden behind the Earth.\nThere was no way of knowing how close it was to the home of these rebels\nof Dalis' Gens.\n\nAnd ever, as they flashed forward, Sarka was recalling that vague hint\non the lips of Jaska, to the effect that Luar, for all her sovereignty\nof the Moon, might be, nonetheless, a native of the Earth. But....\n\nHow? Why? When? There were no answers to any of the questions yet. If\nshe were a native of Earth, how had she reached the Moon? When had she\nbeen sent there? Who was she? Her name, Luar, was a strange one, and\nSarka studied it for many minutes, rolling the odd syllables of it over\nhis tongue, wondering where, on the Earth, he had heard names, or words,\nsimilar to it. This produced no result, until he tried substituting\nvarious letters; then, again, adding various letters. When he achieved a\ncertain result at last, he gasped, and his brain was a-whirl.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLuar, by the addition of the letter _n_, between the _u_ and the _a_,\nbecame Lunar, meaning \"of the Moon!\" Yet Lunar was unmistakably a word\nderived from the language of the Earth! It was possible, of course, that\nthis was mere coincidence; but, taken in connection with the suspicions\nof Jaska, and the incontrovertible fact that Luar resembled people of\nthe Earth, Sarka did not believe in this particular whim of coincidence.\n\nWho was Luar?\n\nHis mind went back to the clucking sounds which, among the Gnomes of the\nMoon, passed for speech. He pondered anew. He shaped his lips, as nearly\nas possible, to make the clucking sounds he had heard, and discovered\nthat it was very difficult to manage the letter _n_!\n\nThe conclusion was inescapable: This woman, Luar, had once been _Lunar_,\nthe _n_, down the centuries, being dropped because difficult for the\nGnomes to pronounce.\n\n\"Yes, Jaska,\" he said suddenly, \"somewhere on Earth, when we reach it,\nwe may discover the secret of Luar--and know far more about Dalis than\nwe have ever known before!\"\n\nJaska merely smiled her inscrutable smile, and did not answer. By\nintuition, she already knew. Let Sarka arrive at her conclusion by\nscientific methods if he desired, and she would simply smile anew.\n\nSarka thought of the manner in which Jaska and he had been transported\nto the Moon; of how much Dalis seemed to know of the secrets of the\nlaboratory of the Sarkas. Might he not have known, two centuries ago, of\nthe Secret Exit Dome, and somehow managed to make use of it in some\nghastly experiment? And still the one question remained unanswered: Who\nwas Luar?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Earth was now so close that details were plainly seen. The Himalayas\nwere out of sight, over the Earth, and by a mental command Sarka managed\nto change slightly the course of the dozen aircars. By passing over the\ncurve of the Earth at a high altitude, he hoped also to see from above\nsomething of the result of the strange aerial bombardment of which his\nfather had spoken.\n\nIn their flight, which had been, to them a flight through the glories of\na super-heavenly Universe, they had lost all count of time. Neither\nSarka nor Jaska, nor yet the people in those other aircars, could have\ntold how long they had been flying, when, coming over the curve of the\nEarth, at an elevation of something like three miles, they were able at\nlast to see into the area which had once housed the Gens of Dalis.\n\nA gasp of horror escaped the lips of Sarka and of Jaska.\n\nThe Gens of Dalis had occupied all the territory northward to the Pole,\nfrom a line drawn east and west through the southernmost of what had\nonce been the Hawaiian Islands. Upon this area had struck the strange\nblue light from the deep Cone of the Moon.\n\nHere, however, the light was invisible, and Sarka flew on in fear that\nsomehow his aircars would blunder into it, and be destroyed--for that\nthe blue light was an agent of ghastly destruction became instantly\napparent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dwellings of the Gens of Dalis were broken and smashed into chaotic\nruins. Over all the area, and even into the area of the Gens southward\nof that which had been Dalis, the blind gods of destruction had\npractically made a clean sweep. Sarka had opportunity to thank God that,\nat the time the blue column had struck the Earth, it had struck at the\nspot which had been almost emptied of people, and realized that blind\nchance had caused it. For, in order for the Gens of Dalis to be in\nposition to launch their attack against the Moon, he had managed, by\nmanipulating the speed of the Beryls, to bring that area into position\ndirectly opposite the Moon.\n\nHad it been otherwise, the blue column might have struck anywhere, and\nwiped out millions of lives!\n\n\"God, Jaska,\" murmured Sarka. \"Look!\"\n\nThink of a shoreline, once lined with mighty buildings, after the\npassage of a tidal wave greater than ever before known to man. The\ndevastation would be indescribable. Multiply that shoreline by the vast\narea which had housed the Gens of Dalis, and the mental picture is\nalmost too big to grasp. Chaos, catastrophe, approaching an infinity of\ndestruction.\n\nThe materials of which the vast buildings, set close together, had been\nmade, had been twisted into grotesque, nightmarish shapes, and the whole\nfused into a burned and gleaming mass--which covered half of what had\nonce been a mighty ocean--as though a bomb larger and more devastating\nthan ever imagined of man, a bomb large enough to rock the Earth, had\nlanded in the midst of the area once occupied by the Gens of Dalis!\n\nYet, Sarka knew, remembering the murmuring of the blue column as it came\nout of the cone, all this devastation had been caused in almost absolute\nsilence. People could have watched and seen these deserted buildings\nslowly fuse together, run together as molten metal runs together, like\nthe lava from a volcano of long ago under the ponderous moving to and\nfro of some invisible, juggernautlike agency.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka shuddered, trying to picture in his mind the massing of the\nminions of Mars, who thus saw a new country given into their hands--if\nthey could take it. Had the Earth been taken by surprise? Had Sarka the\nSecond been able to prepare for the approaching catastrophe?\n\n\"Father,\" he sent his thoughts racing on ahead of him, \"are those lights\nwhich are striking the Earth causing any damage?\"\n\n\"Only,\" came back the instant answer, \"in that they destroy the courage\nof the people of the Earth! The people, however, now know that Sarka is\nreturning, and their courage rises again! The flames are merely a hint\nof what faces us; but the people will rise and follow you wherever you\nlead!\"\n\nSo, as they raced across the area of devastation, the face of Sarka\nbecame calm again. On a chance, he sent a single sentence of strange\nmeaning to his father.\n\n\"The ruler of the Moon is a woman called Luar, which seems a contraction\nof Lunar!\"\n\nFor many minutes Sarka the Second made no answer. When it came it\nstartled Sarka to the depths of him, despite the fact that he had\nexpected to be startled.\n\n\"There was a woman named Lunar!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n_Sarka Commands Again_\n\n\nAhead, through the storms which still hung tenaciously to the roof of\nthe world, flashed those dozen aircars of the Moon. Now Sarka could\nplainly see the dome of his laboratory, and from the depths of him\nwelled up that strange glow which Earthlings recognize as the joy of\nreturning home, than which there is none, save the love for a woman,\ngreater.\n\nNow he could see the effect of those flares, or lights, from Mars, which\nimpinged on the face of the Earth, though he could see no purpose in\nthem, no reason for their being, since they seemed to do no damage at\nall, though the effect of them was weird in the extreme.\n\nOuter darkness, rent with ripping, roaring storms, flurries of ice, snow\nand sleet, shot through and through by balls of lambent flames in\nunguessable numbers. Eery lights which struck the surface of the Earth,\nbounded away and, half a mile or so from the surface again, burst into\nflaming pin-wheels, like skyrockets of ancient times. Strange lights,\ncausing weird effects, but producing no damage at all, save to lessen to\nsome extent the courage of Earthlings, because they did not understand\nthese things. And always, down the ages, man had stood most in fear of\nthe Unknown.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka peered off across the heavens where a ball of flame now seemed to\nbe rising over the horizon, and was amazed at the size of this planet.\nMars was close to Earth, so close that, had they possessed aircars like\nthose of the Moon-people--which remained to be seen--they could easily\nhave attacked the Earth.\n\nAcross the face of the Earth flashed those fiery will-o'-the-wisps from\nMars, without rhyme or reason; yet Sarka knew positively that they\npossessed some meaning, and that the Earth had been forced thus close to\nMars for a purpose. What that purpose was must yet be discovered.\n\nThen, under the aircars, the laboratory of Sarka.\n\nDown dropped the aircars to a landing near the laboratory, and to the\ncubes in the forepeak of each Sarka sent the mental command:\n\n\"Assure yourselves that the aircars will remain where they are! Muster\ninside the laboratory, keeping well away from the Master Beryl!\"\n\nThen to the people who had returned, clothed in strange radiance, from\nthe Moon with Sarka and with Jaska he spoke:\n\n\"Leave the cars and enter my laboratory, where further orders will be\ngiven you!\"\n\nWith Jaska still by his side, Sarka entered the laboratory through the\nExit Dome. Inside, clothing was swiftly brought for the rebels, for\nSarka and for Jaska. But, even when they were clothed, these people who\nhad come back seemed to glow with an inner radiance which transfigured\nthem.\n\nSarka the Second, his face drawn and pale, came from the Observatory to\nmeet his son, and the two were clasped in each other's arms for a\nmoment. Sarka the Second, who had looked no older than his son, seemed\nto have aged a dozen centuries in the time Sarka had been gone.\n\nBut it was not of the threatened attack by Martians that Sarka the\nSecond spoke. He made no statement. He merely asked a question:\n\n\"Was Lunar very beautiful, and just a bit unearthly in appearance?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka started.\n\n\"Yes. Beautiful! Wondrously, fearfully beautiful: but I had the feeling\nthat she had no heart or soul, no conscience: that she was\nsomehow--well, bestial!\"\n\nA moan of anguish escaped Sarka the Second.\n\n\"Dalis again!\" he ejaculated. \"But much of the fault was mine! Before\nyou were born, we scientists of Earth had already several times realized\nthe necessity of expansion for the children of Earth if they were to\ncontinue. Dalis' proposal to my father was discarded, because it\ninvolved the wholesale taking of life. But after the oceans had been\nobliterated, and the human family still outgrew its bounds, Dalis came\nto my father and me with still another proposal. It involved a strange,\nother-worldly young woman whom he called Lunar! Her family--well,\nnothing was known about her, for her family could not be traced. Wiped\nout, I presume, in some inter-family quarrel, leaving her alone. Dalis\nfound her, took an interest in her, and the very strangeness of her gave\nhim his idea, which he brought to my father and me.\n\n\"His proposal was somewhat like that which you made when we sent the\nEarth out of its orbit into outer space, save that Dalis' scheme\ninvolved no such program. His was simply a proposal to somehow\ncommunicate with the Moon by the use of an interplanetary rocket that\nshould carry a human passenger.\n\n\"He put the idea up to this girl, Lunar, and she did not seem to care\none way or another. Dalis was all wrapped up in his ideas, and gave the\ngirl the name of Lunar, as being symbolical of his plans for her. He\ncoached and trained her against the consummation of his plan. We knew\nsomething, theoretically at least, about the conditions on the Moon, and\neverything possible was done for her, to make it feasible for her to\nexist on the Moon. My error was in ever permitting the experiment to be\nmade, since if I had negatived the idea. Dalis would have gone no\nfurther!\n\n\"But I, too, was curious, and Lunar did not care. Well, the rocket was\nconstructed, and shot outward into space by a series of explosions. No\nword was ever received from Lunar, though it was known that she landed\non the Moon!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I say no word was ever received, yet what you have intimated proves\nthat Dalis has either been in mental communication with her, hoping to\ninduce her to send a force against the Earth, and assist him in\nmastering the Earth, overthrowing we Sarkas--or has been biding his\ntime against something of the thing we have now accomplished.\"\n\nThis seemed to clear up many things for Sarka, though it piled higher\nupon his shoulders the weight of his responsibilities. The\nother-worldliness of Lunar, called now Luar, explained her mastery of\nthe Gnomes, and through them the cubes, and her knowledge of the\nomnipotent qualities of the white flames of the Moon's core, which might\nhave been, it came to Sarka in a flash, the source of all life on the\nMoon in the beginning!\n\n\"But father,\" went on Sarka, \"I don't see any sense in this aerial\nbombardment by Mars!\"\n\n\"I believe,\" said Sarka the Second sadly, \"that before another ten hours\npass we shall know the worst there is to be known: but now, son, instead\nof going into attack against the Moon, we go into battle against the\ncombined forces of Mars and of the Moon!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka now took command of the forces of the Earth. Swiftly he turned to\nthe people of the Gens of Dalis who had come back with him.\n\n\"You will be divided into eleven equal groups, as nearly as possible.\nFather, will you please arrange the division? Each group will be\nattached to the staff of one of the Spokesman of the Gens, so that each\nSpokesman will have the benefit of your knowledge with reference to\nconditions on the Moon. Each group will re-enter its particular aircar,\nretaining control of the cube in each case, of course, and will at once\nrepair to his proper station. Telepathy is the mode of communication\nwith the cubes, and you rule them by your will. Each group, when\nassembled by my father, will choose a leader before quitting this\nlaboratory, and such leader will remain in command of his group, under\nthe overlordship of the Spokesman to whom he reports with his group. You\nunderstand!\n\n\"Your loyalty is unquestioned. You will consecrate your lives to the\nwelfare of the Gens to which you are going, since you no longer have a\nGens of your own!\"\n\nSarka turned to the cubes, which had formed in a line just inside the\nExit Dome, and issued a mental command to the cube that had piloted his\naircar from the Moon. The cube faded out instantly, appearing\nimmediately afterward on the table of the vari-colored lights.\n\n\"Father,\" said Sarka, \"while I am issuing orders to the Spokesmen,\nplease see if you can discover the secret of these cubes: how they are\nactuated, the real extent of their intelligence! The rest of you, with\nyour cubes, depart immediately and report to your new Gens!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithin ten minutes the divisions had been made, and the Radiant People\nhad entered the aircars and, outside the laboratory, risen free of the\nEarth, and turned, each in its proper direction, for the Gens of its\nassignment. The Sarkas and Jaska watched them go.\n\nThere remained but one aircar, standing outside on half a dozen of those\ngrim tentacles, with two tentacles swinging free, undulating to and fro\nlike serpents. Harnessed electricity actuating the tentacles--cars and\ntentacles subservient to the cubes.\n\nThe aircars safely on their way, Sarka stepped to the Master Beryl,\ntuned it down to normal speed, and signalled the Spokesmen of the Gens.\n\n\"The Moon and Mars are in alliance against us, and Dalis has allied\nhimself and his Gens with the ruler of the Moon! I don't know yet what\nform the attack will take, but know this: that the safety of the world,\nof all its people, rests in your hands, and that the war into which we\nare going is potentially more vast than expected when this venture\nbegan, and more devastating than the fight with the aircars of the Moon!\nComing to you, in aircars which we managed to take from the\nMoon-people, are such of the people of the Gens of Dalis as were able to\nreturn with me. Question them, gather all the information you can about\nthem, and through them keep control of the cubes which pilot the\naircars, for in the cubes, I believe, lies the secret of our possible\nvictory in the fight to come!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka scarcely knew why he had spoken the last sentence. It was as\nthough something deep within him had risen up, commanded him to speak,\nand deeper yet, far back in his consciousness, was a mental picture of\nthe devastation he had witnessed on his flight above the area that had\nonce housed the Gens of Dalis.\n\nFor in that ghastly area, he believed, was embodied an idea greater than\nmere wanton destruction, just as there was an idea back of the fiery\nlights from Mars greater than mere display. Somehow the two were allied,\nand Sarka believed that, between the blue column, and the fiery lights\nfrom Mars, the fate of the world rested.\n\nHe could, he believed, by manipulation of the Beryls that yet remained,\nmaneuver the world away from that blue column--which on the Earth was\ninvisible. But to have done so would have thwarted the very purpose for\nwhich this mad voyage had been begun. The world had been started on its\nmad journey into space for the purpose of attacking and colonizing the\nMoon and Mars.\n\nThe Moon had been colonized by the Gens of Dalis, already in potential\nrevolt against the Earth. Mars was next, and by forcing the Earth into\nclose proximity to Mars the people of the Moon had played into the hands\nof Earth-people--if the people of Earth were capable of carrying out the\nprogram of expansion originally proposed by Sarka!\n\nIf they were not ... well, Sarka thought somewhat grimly, the resultant\ncataclysmic war would at least solve the problem of over-population!\nInasmuch as the Earth was already committed to whatever might transpire,\nSarka believed he should take a philosophic view of the matter!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka turned to an examination of the Master Beryl, and even as he\npeered into the depths of it, he thought gratefully how nice it was to\nbe home again, in his own laboratory, upon the world of his nativity. He\neven found it within his heart to feel somewhat sorry for Dalis, and to\nfeel ashamed that he had, even in his heart, mistreated him.\n\nThen he thought, with a tightening of his jaw muscles, of the casual way\nin which Dalis had destroyed Sarka the First, of his forcing his people\nto undergo the terrors of the lake of white flames without telling them\nthe simple secret; of his betrayal of the Earth in his swift alliance\nwith Luar; or Luar herself when, as Lunar, a strange waif of Earth,\nDalis had sent her out as the first human passenger aboard a rocket to\nthe Moon. All his pity vanished, though he still believed he had done\nright in sparing Dalis' life.\n\nSuddenly there came an ominous humming in the Beryl, and simultaneously\nsignals from the vari-colored lights on the table. Sarka whirled to the\nlights, noting their color, and mentally repeating the names of the\nSpokesmen who signalled him.\n\nEven before he gave the signal that placed him in position to converse\nwith them, he noted the strange coincidence. The Spokesmen who desired\nspeech with him were tutelary heads of Gens whose borders touched the\ndevasted area where Dalis had but recently been overlord!\n\nAn icy chill caressed his spine as he signalled the Spokesmen to speak.\n\n\"Yes, Vardee? Prull? Klaser? Cleric?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe report of each of them was substantially the same, though couched in\ndifferent words, words freighted heavily with strange terror.\n\n\"The devasted area has suddenly broken into movement! Throughout that\nportion of it visible from my Gens area, the fused mass of debris is\nbubbling, fermenting, walking into life! An aura of unearthly menace\nseems to flow outward from this heaving mass, and the whole is assuming\na most peculiar radiance--cold gleaming, like distant starshine!\"\n\n\"Wait!\" replied Sarka swiftly. \"Wait until the people I have sent you\nhave arrived! Report to me instantly if the movement of the mass is\nnoticeably augmented, and especially so if it seems to be breaking up,\nor coagulating into any sort of form whatever!\"\n\nThen he dimmed the lights, indicating that for the moment there was\nnothing more to be said. Just then his father, face very gray and very\nold, entered the room of the Master Beryl from the laboratory.\n\n\"Son!\" he said. \"The crisis is almost upon us! The Martians are coming!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n_Cubes of Chaos_\n\n\nSarka raced into the Observatory, wondering as he ran how the attack of\nthe Martians would manifest itself; but scarcely prepared for the\nbrilliant display which greeted his gaze. Compared to the oncoming\nflames from Mars, the preceding display of lights had been as nothing.\nThe whole Heavens between the Earth and Mars seemed alight with an\nunearthly glare, as though the very heart of the sun had burst and\nhurled part of its flaming mass outward into space.\n\nOn it came with unbelievable speed.\n\nBut there was no telling, yet, the form of the things which were coming.\n\n\"What are they?\" whispered Jaska, standing fearlessly at Sarka's side.\n\"Interplanetary cars? Rockets? Balls of fire? Or beings of Mars?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Sarka, after studying the display for a few minutes,\n\"that they are either rockets or fireballs, perhaps both together! But\nthe Martians cannot consolidate any position on the Earth without coming\nto handgrips. Since they must know this, we can expect to see the people\nof Mars themselves when, or soon after, those balls of fire strike the\nEarth!\"\n\nSarka raced back to the room of the Master Beryl as a strident humming\ncame through to him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Spokesmen of the Gens whose borders touched those of the devasted\nDalis area, were reporting again, and their voices were high pitched\nwith fear that threatened to break the bounds of sanity.\n\n\"The ferment in the devasted area,\" was the gist of their report, \"is\nassuming myriads of shapes! The fused mass has broken up into isolated\nmasses, and each mass of itself is assuming one of the many forms!\"\n\n\"What forms?\" snapped Sarka. \"Quickly!\"\n\n\"Cubes! Thousands and millions of cubes, and the cubes themselves are\nforming into larger cubes, some square, some rectangular! In the midst\nof these formations are others, mostly columnar, each column consisting\nof cubes which have coalesced into the larger form from the same small\ncubes! The columnar formations are topped by globes which emit an\nethereal radiance!\"\n\n\"Listen!\" Sarka's voice was vibrant with excitement. \"Spokesmen of the\nGens, make sure that every individual member of your Gens is fully\nequipped with flying clothing including belts and ovoids--prepared for\nan indefinite stay outside on the roof of the world! Get your people out\nswiftly, keeping them in formation! Keep about you those people of Dalis\nwhom I sent you, and understand before you break contact with your\nBeryls, that instructions received from these people come from me! In\nturn, after you have quitted the hives, anything you wish to say to me\nyou can repeat to any one of the glowing people of Dalis!\"\n\nThe contacts were broken. Sarka stared into the Beryl, glancing swiftly\nin all directions, to see whether his orders were obeyed.\n\nOut of the myriads of hives were flying the people of all the Gens of\nEarth, their vast numbers already darkening the roof of the world. The\nadvance fires from Mars seemed to have no effect on them, which Sarka\nhad expected, since the fires seemed to consume nothing they had touched\npreviously.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy millions the people came forth. People dressed in the clothing of\nthis Gens or that, wearing each the insignia of the house of his\nSpokesman. A brave show. Sarka could see the faces of many, now in\nlight, now in shadow, as the advance fires of Mars lighted them for a\nmoment in passing, then left them in shadow as the bursting balls of\nfire faded and died.\n\nStrange, too, that the fireballs made no noise. Noiseless flame which\nrebounded from the surface of the Earth broke in silence, deluging the\nheavens with shooting stars of great brilliance. Through its display\nflew the people of the Gens, mustering in flight above flight, each to\nhis own level, under command of the Spokesmen of the Gens.\n\n\"How long, father,\" queried Sarka, \"should it take to empty the Gens\nareas?\"\n\n\"The people of Earth have been waiting for word to go into battle since\nwe first sent the people of Dalis against the Moon-men. They still are\nready! The dwellings of our people, _all_ of them, can be emptied within\nan hour!\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" mused Sarka, \"if that is soon enough!\"\n\nPerhaps yes, perhaps no. It would be a race, in any case. Sarka divided\nhis attention between the rapidly changing formations of the Moon-cubes\nin that devasted area and the onrushing charge of the fire-balls from\nMars. All were visible to him through the Master Beryl, and from the\nObservatory, though the Martian fire-balls were now so close that the\nvanguard of them could even be seen in the Master Beryl, adjusted to\nview only activities on the surface of the Earth.\n\nEven as the last flights of the Gens of Earth were slipping into the icy\nair from the roof of the world, the Moon-cubes began their terrifying,\nappalling attack, every detail of which could be seen by Sarka from the\nMaster Beryl.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThose columns, composed of cubes, seemed to be the leaders of a vast\ncube-army. The top of each of them was a gleaming globe whose eery light\nplayed over the country immediately surrounding each column, their weird\nlight reflected in the squares, rectangles and globes that other cubes\nhad formed.\n\nSarka sought swiftly among the columns for the one which might\nconceivably be in supreme command; but even as he sought the Moon-cubes\nmoved to the attack. The globes on the tops of the columns dimmed their\nlights, and the squares, rectangles and globes got instantly into\nterrible motion.\n\nSouthward from the position in which they had formed they began to move,\nthe squares and rectangles apparently sliding along the surface of the\nscarred and broken soil, the globes rolling.\n\nSouthward there was the vast wall of the Gens that bordered the devasted\narea in that direction, and the cube-army was instantly at full charge\ntoward this, in what Sarka realized was, to be a war of demolition!\n\nWithin a minute, Sarka was conscious of a trembling of all the\nlaboratory, and the eyes of Jaska were wide with fear. Swiftly the\ntrembling grew, until sound now was added to the vast, awesome tremor--a\nvast, roaring crescendo of sound that mounted and mounted as the speed\nof the cube-army increased. The vanguard of the cube-army struck the\ndwelling of the Gens southward of that of Dalis, and a mighty,\nrocketing roar sounded in the Master Beryl, was audible inside the\nlaboratory, even without the aid of the Beryl, at whose surface Sarka\nstared as a man fascinated, hypnotized.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cube-army struck the dwellings, disappeared into them as though they\nhad been composed of tissue paper, and continued on! Over the tops of\nthe cube-army toppled the roofs of the dwellings, there, in the midst of\nthe cubes, to be ground to powder, with a sound as of a million\navalanches grinding together in some awesome, sun-size valley.\nSouthward, in the wake of the chaotic charge, moved a mighty, gigantic\ncrevasse, whose sides were the walls of the hives left standing. And\nstill the cube-army moved in, grinding everything it touched to dust,\ntrampling buildings into nothingness, destroying utterly along a front\nhundreds of miles wide, and as deep as the dwellings of men!\n\n\"God!\" cried Sarka, his voice so tense that both his father and Jaska\nheard it above the roaring which shook and rocked the world. \"Do you\nsee? The Moon-cubes are destroying the dwelling of our people, and the\nMartians are to destroy the people who have fled!\"\n\n\"There must be a way,\" said Sarka the Second quietly, \"to circumvent the\ncubes! But what? Your will still rules the cubes which piloted you from\nthe Moon?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Sarka tersely, \"but there are only a dozen of the cubes.\nWhat can they do against countless millions of them? Cubes which are\nMoon-cubes, brought to the Earth in the heart of that blue column, here\nreformed to create an army which is invincible, because it cannot be\nslain! It means that the Moon-people themselves, thousands of miles out\nof our reach, have but to sit in comfort and watch their cube-slaves\ndestroy us! When they have laid waste the Earth, the Martians have but\nto finish the fight!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"If, beloved,\" said Jaska, \"your will commands those twelve cubes, it\ncan also command all the others, for they must be essentially the same.\nCall on the rebels of Dalis to help you!\"\n\n\"Then what of the Spokesmen of the Gens, who will be out of contact with\nme?\"\n\n\"They must stand on their own feet, must fight their own battle! Call to\nyou the people who have passed through the white flames, and fight with\nthe distant will of Luar and of Dalis for control of the cube-army!\"\n\nAgain that exaltation, which convinced him he could move mountains with\nhis two hands, coursed through the being of Sarka.\n\nQuietly be answered Jaska.\n\n\"I believe you are right,\" he said softly. \"Those of us who have passed\nthrough the flames which bore these Moon-cubes will control the cubes,\neven bend them to our will. The Spokesmen must vanquish the Martians or\nperish!\"\n\nThen he sent his mental commands to the Spokesmen:\n\n\"Meet the Martians when they arrive and destroy or drive them back! You\nlive only if you win! We speak no more until victory is ours! People of\nthe Gens of Dalis, go to the areas being devasted by the cubes, taking\nyour cubes and aircars with you, and I will join you there! _And Jaska\nwith me!_\"\n\nSarka had not himself mentally spoken the last four words. Jaska had\nthought-spoken them, before he could prevent. He turned upon her, lips\nshaping a command that she remain behind. But she forestalled him.\n\n\"I, too, have been through the white flames! You may have need of all of\nus!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n_The Struggle for Mastery_\n\n\nThe people of all the Gens of Earth were now between two fires. The\ncube-army, ruled by the mistress of the Moon, was laying waste the\ndwellings of the Gens, destroying them with a speed and surety of which\nno earthquake, whatever its proportions, would have been capable. The\nGens were forced out upon the roof of the world--where, scarcely had\nthey maneuvered into their prearranged formations, than the Martians\nstruck.\n\nThose huge balls of fire, larger even than the aircars of the Moon,\nlanded in vast and awe-inspiring numbers on the roof of the\nworld--landed easily, with no apparent effort or shock. The light of\nthem made all the world a place of vast radiance, save only that portion\nwhich was being destroyed by the cube-army, and this area had a cold,\nchill radiance of its own.\n\nBy groups and organisations the fire-balls of Mars landed, and rested\nquiescent on the surface of the globe.\n\nSarka, pausing only long enough in his laboratory to study this strange\nattack and to discover how it would get under way, was at the same time\npreparing to go forth to take his own strange part in the defensive\naction of Earthlings. A vast confidence was in him....\n\n\"We will lose millions of people, father,\" he said softly. \"But it will\nend in our victory, in the most glorious war ever fought on this Earth!\"\n\n\"That is true, my son!\" replied the older man sadly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor several minutes the vast fire-balls, which seemed to be monster\nglowing octagons, rested where they had landed, and even then the Gens\nof the people were closing on them, bringing their ray directors and\natom-disintegrators into action.\n\nThen, when the Earthlings would have destroyed the first of the vast\nfire-balls--and Sarka was noting that the flames which bathed the balls\nseemed to have no effect whatever on Earthlings, save to outline them in\nmantles of fire--the fire-balls wakened to new life.\n\nThey opened like the halves of peaches falling apart, and out upon the\nroof of the world poured the first Martians Earth had ever seen!\n\nThey were more than twice the size, on the average, of Earth people, and\nat first glance seemed to resemble them very much, save that their eyes,\nof which each Martian was possessed of two, were set on the ends of long\ntentacles which could stretch forth to a length of two feet or more from\nthe eye-sockets and thus be turned in any direction. Each eye was\nindependent of its neighbor, as one could look forward while the other\nlooked backward, or one could look right while the other looked left.\n\nEach Martian possessed two arms on each side of a huge, powerful torso,\nand legs that were like the bolls of trees, compared to the slender\nlimbs of Earthlings. All the Martians seemed to be dressed in the skins\nof strange, vari-colored beasts. Each carried in his upper right hand a\nslender canelike thing some three feet in length, from whose tip there\nflashed those spurts of flame which had puzzled the Earth people before\nthe actual launching of the attack.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeyond these weapons, the Martians seemed to possess no weapons of\noffense at all, nor of defense.\n\n\"With our ray directors and atom-disintegrators,\" said Sarka, moving\ninto the Exit Dome with Jaska, \"we can blast them from the face of the\nEarth!\"\n\nBut in a moment he realized that he had spoken too hastily.\n\nThe nearest fire-ball was, of course, within the area of the Gens of\nCleric, and Sarka could here see with his naked eyes all that\ntranspired. The Martian passengers, who moved swiftly away from their\nfire-ball vehicles, then a flight of the Gens of Cleric descended upon\nthe fireball and its fleeing passengers, with tiny ray directors and\natom-disintegrators held to the fore, ready for action.\n\nThe Martians, at some distance from their glowing vehicle, paused and\nformed a ragged line, facing the ball, staring at the descending people\nof the Gens of Cleric, their tentaclelike eyes waving to and fro, oddly\nlike the tentacles of those aircars of the Moon.\n\nThe flight was hovering above the first fireball. In a second now, at\nthe command of an underling, the ray directors would destroy fire-ball\nand Martians as thoroughly as though they had never existed at all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut then a strange thing happened. At that exact moment, timing their\nactions to fractions of seconds, the Martians raised and pointed their\ncanelike weapons of the spurting flames. They pointed them, however, not\nat the Earthlings, but at the fire-ball which had brought them to Earth!\n\nInstantly the fire-ball exploded as with the roaring of a hundred mighty\nvolcanoes--and the descending flight of the Gens of Cleric was blasted\ninto countless fragments! Bits of them flew in all directions. Many\ndropped, the mangled, infinitesmal remains of them, down to the roof of\nEarth, while many were hurled skyward through formations above\nthem--while those formations, to a height of a full two miles, were\nbroken asunder. Many flights above that first flight were smashed and\nbroken, their individual members hurled in all directions by that one\nsingle blast of a single fire-ball.\n\nIndividuals who escaped destruction were hurled end over end, upward\nthrough other flights higher above, and the whole aggregation of flights\nwhich had been concentrated on that first fire-ball was instantly\ndemoralized, while full fifty per cent of its individuals were instantly\ntorn to bits!\n\nSarka groaned to the depths of him.\n\n\"The leader of the Martians, or the master who sent them here, sent them\nhere to win. For if they do not win, they cannot return to Mars, as they\nwill have destroyed their vehicles! Their confidence is superhuman!\"\n\n\"Have faith in the courage of Earthlings, son!\" said Sarka.\n\nIt was much to ask, for if one single one of these fire-balls could\nwreak such havoc with the people of Earth, what would be the destruction\nby the countless other unexploded fireballs of the Martians?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStill, the Spokesmen themselves must discover a way to hold their own,\nto win against the Martians. For Sarka there was greater work to do. He\nmust oppose the wills of Luar and of Dalis in a mighty mental conflict,\nwhich would decide whether the homes of men would be saved, or utterly\ndestroyed by the Moon-cubes.\n\nBut as he left through the Exit Dome, with Jaska by his side, he\nshuddered, and was just a little sick inside as he saw the fearful\nresult of that first explosion of a Martian fire-ball! Bits of human\nwreckage were scattered over the Earth for a great distance in all\ndirections from where the fire-ball had exploded. And at that spot a\ngigantic crater had been torn in the roof of the world, going down to\nnone knew what depths.\n\nEven the Martians, here only to consolidate positions which had passed\nthe demolition of the Moon-cubes, were capable of demolitions almost as\nghastly and complete as those of the cubes!\n\nThe sound was incapable of being described, for outside the laboratory\nthe sound of the advance of the Moon-cubes eating into the dwellings of\nmen, tumbling them down, grinding them to powder, was cataclysmic in its\nmighty volume. A million express trains crashing head-on into walls of\ngalvanized iron at top speed, simultaneously.\n\nEar-drum crashing blows as fireballs exploded. The screams and shrieks\nof maimed and dying Earthlings--of Earthlings unwounded but possessed of\nabysmal fear....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen, resolutely, Sarka turned his back on the conflict between the\nMartians and the people of Earth, and hurtled across the devastated\nroof of the world toward that area which was feeling the destructive\nforce of the vandal cube-army. As he flew, Jaska keeping pace with him\nin silence, his mind was busy.\n\nPassage through the white flames of the Moon had given him the key.\nThose white flames--source of all life on the Moon--rendered almost\ngodlike those whom it bathed ... gave them unbelievable access of mental\nbrilliance ... were the source of that blue column which had forced the\nEarth outward toward Mars ... were the source, in some way, of the cubes\nthemselves, as he and Jaska, after passing through them, owed their now\nnear-divinity to the same white flames! Those flames had made Luar\nmistress of the Moon--therefore of the Gnomes and of the cubes!\nTherefore, Sarka, having been bathed in the flames, should make himself\nmaster of the cubes, if he could out-will the combined determinations of\nLuar and of Dalis!\n\nHis confidence was supreme as he fled through outer darkness toward the\neery light which came from the area of demolitions. Looking ahead, he\ncould see tiny glows in the sky, which he knew to be the rebels of\nDalis' Gens, flying to keep their rendezvous with him.\n\nHigher mounted his courage and his confidence as he approached the\nroaring crash, perpetual and always mounting, which showed him where the\ncube-army was busiest. The sound vibrated the very air, causing the\nbodies of Sarka to tingle with it, causing them to flutter and shake in\ntheir flight with its awesome power. But they did not hold back, flew\nonward through the gloom, leaving behind them the brightly lighted areas\nwhere Gens of Earth battled with the fireballs of the Martians, moving\ninto the area of the eery glowing of the cubes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust as he approached the spot where mighty dwellings were tumbling\nbefore the march of the cube-army, he sent a single command toward the\ncube which had piloted him from the Moon.\n\n\"Come to me on the edge of the crevasse nearest the place of most\ndestruction!\"\n\nWould the cube now be subservient to his will? He wondered. Everything\ndepended upon that. If not, then he might as well try to stay the forces\nof a mighty avalanche with his breath, as halt the cube-army with his\nwill.\n\nBut strangely enough, the closer he came to the vast area of tumbling\ndwellings the calmer he became, the more sure that he would win against\nthe cubes.\n\nFor when he landed at the lip of the crevasse, across which he could\nlook for a hundred miles, a single cube gleamed brightly almost at his\nfeet, awaiting his orders!\n\nOne by one, by twos, threes, fours, dozens, came the glowing people who\nhad been bathed in the white flames of the Moon's life-source, and as\neach dropped down beside him, Sarka gave a command.\n\n\"Drop down in the midst of the cubes! Make your own cube the rallying\npoint for this vast army of cubes, force the cubes to desist in their\nmighty destruction, be subservient to your will--and do you, each of\nyou, be subservient to _my_ will!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAway dropped the rebels, glowing points of white flame, dropping down\nthe sides of the crevasse, a mighty, awesome canyon, into the very heart\nof the activity of the cubes, and from the brain of Sarka, aided by the\nwill of Jaska, went forth a simple command:\n\n\"Cease your march of destruction, O Moon-cubes, and harken to the will\nof Sarka, your master! Draw back from your labors, and muster, not as\nsquares, rectangles and columns, but as individual cubes, in the area\nalready devastated by you! Rally about the glowing people who have\npassed through the flames which were your Moon-mother, and wait for\norders! Take no further heed of commands from Dalis and Luar!\"\n\nInstantly it seemed to Sarka that he had drawn into some invisible\nvortex which tore at his brain, at his body, at his soul. Inside him a\ncold voice seemed to say:\n\n\"Fool, Sarka! My will is greater than yours!\"\n\nBut though the force of the will of Luar, whose thought he recognized,\ntore at him, almost shriveled the soul and brain of him with its might,\nhe continued to send his thought-command out to the Moon-cubes, forcing\nit through the wall of Luar's will, hurling it like invisible\nprojectiles at the cube-army below.\n\nExultation possessed him, buoyed him up, gave him greater courage and\nconfidence as the moments passed for even as all his being concentrated\non the will-command to the cubes, his senses told him that the mighty\nsound of destruction was dying away, fading out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlower now the dwellings fell, slower moved the Moon-cubes; and as they\nslowed in their mighty march through the dwellings of men, so increased\nthe confidence, the power of will, of Sarka and his people--the rebels\nof the Gens of Dalis.\n\nThen, after an hour, whose mighty mental conflict had bathed Sarka in\nthe perspiration of superhuman effort, the sound of destruction ceased\nall together, and the dwellings ceased to fall.\n\nA silent shout, like an inborn paean of rejoicing, surged through Sarka\nas he noted the retreat from the dwellings of men, of the Moon-cubes!\nBack and back retreated the squares and the rectangles, the columns and\nthe globes, breaking apart as they retreated.\n\nWithin fifteen minutes after the destruction had ceased, millions of\ngleaming cubes winked upward from the bottom of the\ncrevasse--motionless, quiescent!\n\nSarka sent forth another thought.\n\n\"I am your master, O cubes of the Moon!\"\n\nNo sound, no movement, answered him.\n\n\"Luar and Dalis are no longer able to command you!\"\n\nStill no sound or movement of the cubes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen, taking a deep breath, as of a swimmer preparing to dive into icy\nwater, Sarka gave a new command.\n\n\"Dissolve! Reform on the roof of the world in globes! Roll over the face\nof the Earth, destroy the fire-balls of Mars--and take prisoners, inside\nthe globes, the attackers from Mars!\"\n\nInstantly the gleaming cubes vanished, and darkness as of a mighty pit\npossessed the crevasse of destruction. Then, at the lip of the great\ncrevasse, the cubes swept into form--myriads of globes which gleamed\nwith the cold blue brilliance of the Moon!\n\nThey had no sooner formed as globes than they were in action again,\nrolling over the roof of the world as with a rising crescendo of thunder\ntumbling down the night-black sky. So mighty was their rush that the\nroof of the world trembled and shook.\n\nAbove their charge raced Sarka and Jaska, and with them the rebels of\nthe Gens of Dalis.\n\nAll were present when the cubes crashed into the fire-balls from Mars,\nswept the Martians within themselves as prisoners, held them\nsecurely--and continued on, destroying the fire-balls in myriads. Here\nand there fire-balls exploded on contact, destroying the globes, which\nimmediately reformed again, as though the explosions had not been felt\nat all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka had won the allegiance of the Moon-cubes, which had defeated and\ntaken prisoners the Martians, destroying the vehicles in which they\nmight have returned to Mars. And as realization came, darkness settled\nover the roof of the world; the last flare of Mars faded and died.\n\nThis done, the cubes formed in mighty rows, facing the laboratory of\nSarka. His heart beating madly with exultation, Sarka studied them. Then\nhe stepped into the Observatory, gazed away across the space which\nseparated the Earth from the Moon, sent a mental message winging\noutward.\n\n\"Luar! Dalis!\"\n\nFaintly, fearfully, came the answer.\n\n\"We hear, O Sarka!\"\n\n\"Shift the blue column away from the Earth! Do not interfere as we\nreturn to our orbit about the sun! Obey, or I combine the total\nknowledge of Mars, the Earth, and the Moon in an attack against you and\nyour Martian ally! Inform your ally that their people will not return,\nthat the Earth has need of them--but that two Gens of Earth will be\nreceived by Martians in perfect amity, and these Gens allowed biding\nplaces on Mars! Unless your ally obeys, the Martians in my hands will be\ndestroyed!\"\n\nIn an hour the answer came, the snarling thought-answer of Dalis.\n\n\"We hear! We obey! But Dalis is never beaten while he lives! His day\nwill come!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka found himself feeling even a little sorry for sorely beaten Dalis;\nbut his face was grim as he sent another command to the people of Dalis\nwho had passed through the life-source of the Moon.\n\n\"Take command of the cubes, and force them to repair the damage which\nhas been done to the dwellings of men--to repair them completely, over\nall the face of the Earth!\"\n\nAs the glowing people hurried to obey, Sarka softly asked his father:\n\n\"But what shall we do with the Martians?\"\n\nSarka the Second smiled.\n\n\"Release them and send them to the lowest level where, guarded by the\ncubes, they will be set to constructing fireballs like those in which\nthey arrived for the use of Earth if Dalis, or the Martians, ever attack\nagain! And, son....\"\n\n\"Yes, O my father?\" said Sarka softly.\n\n\"I have another suggestion for the employment of the cubes! Let them\nbuild aircars to be used by the Gens of Prull and of Klaser, as\ntransportation to Mars whenever you are ready for them to go!\"\n\nSarka smiled boyishly, happily.\n\n\"Yes, O my father; and is there anything else?\"\n\n\"Yes! Take Jaska as your mate! Do you not see that she is waiting for\nyou to speak?\"\n\nSarka turned to Jaska, whose face was glorious in her surrender, and\nwhose lips were parted in a loving smile--which faded only when Sarka's\nlips caressed it away.\n\n  (_The end._)\n\n\n\n\n  ASTOUNDING STORIES\n\n  _Appears on Newsstands_\n\n  THE FIRST THURSDAY IN EACH MONTH\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: The Readers' Corner\n\n_A Meeting Place for Readers of_ Astounding Stories]\n\n\n  _From Australia_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n     I am taking the privilege of writing to you in an endeavor to show\n     my appreciation of your magazine Astounding Stories.\n\n     Although I am an inveterate reader I must say that I have never\n     read any book or magazine to come up to the above, and confess that\n     though I am ignorant of the intricacies of science (and lacked\n     interest in same prior to my reading your first issue) same is\n     described so plainly that I have no trouble in fully understanding\n     exactly what the author conveys. I must thank you for this other\n     interest in the monotony of life.\n\n     Have pleasure of informing you that through my enthusiasm have\n     created several subscribers, and on occasions when adopting the age\n     old custom of placing my foot upon the rail and bending the elbow,\n     have entered into many a conversation and discussion re the\n     different stories included in your magazine.\n\n     I assure you of my whole-hearted support in the furthering of the\n     popularity of your enjoyable and unique work in my country, and\n     wish you every success in your venture.--M. B. Johnston, 237\n     Flinders Lane, Melbourne, Australia.\n\n\n  _Mr. Neal's Favorites_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n     The other day I saw Astounding Stories on one of the newsstands. I\n     purchased it, and after reading \"Brigands of the Moon\", I eagerly\n     finished the rest of the magazine. I did not like \"Out of the\n     Dreadful Depths.\" In my opinion it should not be in a Science\n     Fiction magazine. The only thing the matter with your magazine is\n     that it is too small. I would like to read some stories in \"our\"\n     magazine by Ed Earl Repp, David H. Keller, M. D., Miles J. Brewer,\n     M. D., and Stanton Coblentz--Francis Neal, R. R. 4, Box 105,\n     Kokomo, Ind.\n\n\n  _No Ghost Stories_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n     I received your April issue and I think it is the best yet. I have\n     but one complaint to make, and that is your magazine seems to print\n     some good science stories, but also has some stories which do not\n     belong in a Science Fiction magazine. They might come under the\n     name of weird tales. Is your magazine devoted to pure 100 per cent.\n     Science Fiction? If so, I think you ought to leave out the ghost\n     stories.--Louis Wentzler, 1933 Woodbine St., Brooklyn, N. Y.\n\n\n  _From the Other Sex_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n     You'll be surprised to hear from a girl, as I notice only boys\n     wrote to praise your new magazine. I tried reading some of the\n     Science Fiction magazines my brother buys every month but I'd start\n     reading a story only to leave it unfinished. But your magazine is\n     different. When I picked it up to read it I thought I'd soon throw\n     it down and read something else, but the moment I started to read\n     one of the stories of your new magazine I read it to the finish. I\n     never read such vivid and exciting stories. Even my brother who\n     loves all kinds of Science Fiction magazines couldn't stop praising\n     your new magazine. He said Astounding Stories beats them all.\n\n     Some of our readers criticized your new magazine, and I haven't\n     anything but disagreement for them. Yet, who am I, to judge persons\n     who have read and know all about Science Fiction?\n\n     Will recommend your new magazine to all my friends.--Sue O'Bara,\n     13440 Barley Ave., Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n  _January Issue Was First_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n     I have just finished reading the April issue of \"our\" magazine. Can\n     mere words describe my feelings? I am classing the stories as\n     follows: A--excellent; B--very good; C--good; D--passable; E--poor.\n\n     A--\"Monsters of Moyen,\" \"Vampires of Venus,\" \"The Ray of Madness,\"\n     \"The Soul-Snatcher.\"\n\n     B--\"The Man Who Was Dead.\"\n\n     C--None. D--None. E--None.\n\n     \"Brigands of the Moon\" is getting more and more interesting. Can\n     you please tell me which month's issue was the first one, as I\n     didn't procure the first two copies and should like to do so?--Eli\n     Meltzer, 1466 Coney Island Ave., Brooklyn, N. Y.\n\n\n  \"_Eclipses All_\"\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n     Just as soon as your new magazine came out I espied it. It eclipsed\n     all the other magazines on the stand. As a cub magazine I couldn't\n     ask for more.\n\n     I am going to comment on your stories now because I know you want\n     me too, for I know you would like to know what sort of stories your\n     readers like.\n\n     I have a lot to say about Ray Cummings. He is the best writer I\n     have ever seen. His stories couldn't be beat. \"Phantoms of Reality\"\n     was a corking good story, but I believe his new serial, \"Brigands\n     of the Moon,\" is going to be better. Captain S. P. Meek is a very\n     good writer also. I take immense joy in his Dr. Bird stories. And\n     we must not forget that great writer, Murray Leinster. His stories\n     are really good.\n\n     I congratulate you on your new magazine, Mr. Editor.--Albert\n     Philbrick, 117 N. Spring St., Springfield, Ohio.\n\n\n  \"_A Unique Magazine_\"\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n     I've been trying to write your magazine for a long time, so here\n     goes.\n\n     I've bought every copy from the first issue and sure think it is a\n     good magazine. In fact I should say a unique magazine; there are\n     but few magazines in its class among Science Fiction magazines. The\n     stories come up to the standards of good Science Fiction, and some\n     go far above it. A few stories I did not like were: \"The Man Who\n     Was Dead,\" \"The Soul Snatcher,\" \"The Corpse on the Grating\" and\n     \"The Stolen Mind.\" The science in all these stories was very poor.\n     But your magazine became better in my eyes when you published\n     \"Phantoms of Reality,\" \"Tanks,\" \"Old Crompton's Secret,\" \"Brigands\n     of the Moon,\" \"Monsters of Moyen,\" and all of Captain S. P. Meek's\n     stories. These were extraordinarily good stories.\n\n     Wesso's drawings are very good, and I hope you keep him. I have\n     seen his drawings in another magazine for quite a time. I don't\n     like the illustrations of your other artist. Could you, by chance,\n     secure an artist by the name of Leo Morey or Hugh Mackay? They both\n     illustrate for other Science Fiction magazines and are about as\n     good as Wesso. Please keep the latter. And why don't you have him\n     to do all of your illustrating?\n\n     Sorry to seem such a grouch, but I don't like your grade of paper\n     either. And why not enlarge the magazine to about 11\" x 9\" by 1/2\",\n     and charge 25 cents for your thoroughly good magazine, apart from\n     the defects I have mentioned.\n\n     About your authors. They are, for the most part, good. But they are\n     mostly amateurs at writing Science Fiction stories. I am delighted\n     to see such expert writers of Science Fiction as Harl Vincent, Ray\n     Cummings, Victor Rousseau and Captain S. P. Meek writing for your\n     magazine, but couldn't you include in your staff of authors A.\n     Hyatt Verrill, Dr. Miles J. Breuer, Dr. David H. Keller, R. F.\n     Starzl, and a few more such notable authors? I hope to see these\n     authors in your magazine soon.--Linus Hogenmiller, 502 N.\n     Washington St., Farmington, Mo.\n\n\n  _The Star System!_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n     One star means fairly good, two stars, good; three stars,\n     excellent; four, extraordinary; no stars--just another story.\n\n     I give \"Brigands of the Moon,\" by Ray Cummings, three stars; \"The\n     Atom-Smasher,\" by Victor Rousseau, three stars; \"Murder Madness,\"\n     by Murray Leinster, two stars; \"Into the Ocean Depths,\" by S. P.\n     Wright, two stars, and \"The Jovian Jest,\" by L. Lorraine, no stars.\n     It was short and sweet.\n\n     Wesso sure can draw. I would like to see a full page illustration\n     for each story by him.\n\n     My favorite type of stories are interplanetary, and, second\n     favorite, stories of future wars. Will you have many of them in the\n     future? I like long stories like the novelette in the May issue of\n     Astounding Stories--Jack Darrow, 4225 N. Spaulding Ave., Chicago,\n     Illinois.\n\n\n  _We Expect Not To_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n     While going over your \"The Readers' Corner\" of the April issue, I\n     noticed in your answer to one of the letters that you will avoid\n     reprints. Now many of your readers have not read the older classics\n     of Science Fiction. Would it not be a good idea to publish a\n     reprint at least once a year? One of the suggestions given was\n     Merritt's \"Through the Dragon Glass.\" Another very interesting\n     story, and one that I am sure almost all of your followers have not\n     read, is \"The Blind Spot,\" by Homer Flint.\n\n     I like the idea of having three members to a volume, as it will be\n     much easier to bind. Now, starting with the April issue, I think\n     that the best story in there is \"Monsters of Moyen.\" \"The Ray of\n     Madness\" was up to the usual standard of Capt. S. P. Meek's\n     stories. \"The Man Who Was Dead\" was fairly good; average, I would\n     say. I did not like \"Vampires of Venus.\"\n\n     I say that the May issue was the best of the Astounding Stories. I\n     was satisfied with every story in it. \"Into the Ocean Depths\" was\n     the best story, \"The Atom Smasher\" being a close second. I like the\n     way the story \"Into the Ocean Depths\" ended; a slight trace of\n     sadness and not at all like the \"and they lived happily ever after\"\n     ending. A real story.\n\n     I was disappointed in not finding any story concerning Dr. Bird in\n     the April issue. Will any more be printed soon?\n\n     Before I close I would like a definite answer to this question:\n     Will you ever, or in the near future, reprint any of the genre of\n     Science Fiction, stories by the late master Garret P. Serviss, or\n     from the pen of A. Merritt and H. G. Wells?--Nathan Greenfeld, 313\n     E. 70th St., New York City.\n\n\n  _Again Reprints_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n     Although I am a reader of six Science Fiction magazines, I was more\n     than glad to see the latest one out, Astounding Stories. Because\n     the stories are all interesting. I consider Astounding Stories\n     superior to most of the Science Fiction periodicals on the\n     newsstands to-day.\n\n     My favorite stories are those of interplanetary voyages and other\n     worlds. My favorite authors are: Ray Cummings, A. Merritt, Victor\n     Rousseau, Murray Leinster, Arthur J. Burks and Harl Vincent. I hope\n     that you will soon have stories by Edmond Hamilton and David H.\n     Keller.\n\n     Now here is something I hope you will give some thought and\n     consideration. I noticed that many of the readers wrote in,\n     requesting reprints. I am one of those who would like to see you\n     publish some reprints, especially stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs,\n     A. Merritt and Ray Cummings. These authors have written many\n     masterpieces of Science Fiction. It is very difficult, if not\n     impossible, for a person to get these stories. They could be made\n     available easily if Astounding Stories would reprint them.\n\n     Most of the readers who object to reprints do so because they would\n     hate to see a story by H. G. Wells or Jules Verne. I, myself, do\n     not like these authors as they are too dull. But if you have only\n     reprints by the three authors I mentioned and a few other popular\n     writers, I am sure all the readers would welcome them. At least you\n     could have a vote and see how they stand on reprints--Michael\n     Fogaris, 157 Fourth St., Passaic, N. J.\n\n\n  _Likes_ \"_The Readers' Corner_\"\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n     Your \"The Readers' Corner\" interests me very much. It surely does\n     show how your magazine pleases its readers. You cannot get too much\n     science in your stories to suit me. Chemistry and physics more than\n     anything else.\n\n     I surely enjoyed reading \"Mad Music\" and \"The Thief of Time.\" I\n     don't like long stories. They are too interesting to have to wait a\n     month for the next part.\n\n     I hope that your magazine continues to have as \"astounding\" stories\n     as it has in the past.--Vern L. Enrich, R. F. D. 1, Casey,\n     Illinois.\n\n\n  _From Master Weiner_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n     One day coming home from school I saw your magazine. That night I\n     bought it and have since been an ardent reader.\n\n     But why not give us a change? I prefer stories of the Sargasso Sea,\n     the Maelstrom, and about invasions of the Earth.--Milton Weiner,\n     age 12, 2430 Baker St., Baltimore Maryland.\n\n\n  _High Praise_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n     Enclosed you will find twenty cents in stamps for the first copy of\n     Astounding Stories.\n\n     I have just finished the May issue of Astounding Stories and the\n     rating of the stories is: 1--\"Brigands of the Moon\"--Excellent!\n     2--\"The Atom Smasher\"--Marvelous! 3--\"Murder Madness\"--Perfect.\n     4--\"Into the Ocean's Depths\"--Good. 5--\"The Jovian Jest\"--Pretty\n     Good.\n\n     The cover design by H. Wesso is good. Don't lose him.\n\n     I would like more stories by Victor Rousseau and Ray Cummings.\n     Where are some stories by H. G. Wells, Stanton Coblens, Gawain\n     Edwards, Francis Flagg, Henrik Jarve and Dr. Keller? My favorite\n     stories are interplanetary stories.\n\n     Here are some things that may improve your magazine (though I must\n     say that your magazine is about perfect as it is): More pictures in\n     long stories; about two novelettes in each issue; about two short\n     stories in each issue; more interplanetary novels and novelettes;\n     about one serial in one issue; smoother paper.--Isidore Horowitz,\n     1161 Stratford Avenue, New York City.\n\n\n  \"_Fairly Good Satire_\"\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n     I have read your two issues of Astounding Stories and I feel they\n     will fill a very much needed place in literature.\n\n     I am especially interested in the stories like the \"Vampires of\n     Venus\" and the \"Brigands of the Moon.\" The \"Vampires of Venus\" can\n     be classed as a fairly good satire on Earth beings; I consider that\n     story one with a moral. It reminds one of Voltaire's Micromegas,\n     and it's taking us to another planet to show us our faults at home\n     will stimulate interest in social improvement.\n\n     I have kept tab on Edgar Rice Burroughs' writings because he\n     teaches evolution in a way that makes it easy for the ordinary\n     reader to grasp.\n\n     You have a great field, if you can keep up the interplanetary\n     stories and mix some evolutionary stories with them.\n\n     The true stories are playing a valuable part in stimulating people\n     to take a deeper view of life, and you have a field in Astounding\n     Stories almost without a competitor.--J. L. Stark, 530 Sutcliffe\n     Ave., Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n\n  _He is H. W. Wessolowski_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n     Since I have read every copy of Astounding Stories since it was\n     inaugurated I feel well qualified to contribute a few bouquets and\n     also some criticism. The cover illustrations are wonderful but I\n     cannot find the artist's name on it. So good an artist should put\n     his \"moniker\" on his productions. I am glad to see that the words\n     \"Super-Science\" are on the top of the cover in bright red letters;\n     some other Science Fiction magazines seem desirous of disguising\n     the contents of their magazines for some obscure and mysterious\n     reason.\n\n     And now a brickbat. It is my humble opinion that the science should\n     be examined more carefully before the stories are printed in this\n     excellent magazine. The stories should be not only astounding, but\n     should contain some science information that will be remembered\n     after the fiction is forgotten. \"The Man Who Was Dead\" is an\n     excellent ghost story or weird tale, but is out of place in \"our\"\n     magazine. (I take the liberty to call it \"our\" magazine since a\n     department is given over to the readers and we express our choice\n     of the kind of stories that are printed.) However, taken all\n     together, our magazine is steadily improving; each issue up to now\n     has been distinctly better than the one before.\n\n     I have graded the stories in the April and May copies as follows:\n     Excellent--\"Vampires of Venus,\" \"The Ray of Madness,\" \"Brigands\n     of the Moon,\" \"Murder Madness,\" \"Into the Ocean's Depths\" and \"The\n     Jovian Jest.\" Good--\"Monsters of Moyen,\" \"The Atom Smasher\" and\n     \"The Soul Searcher.\" Poor--\"The Man Who Was Dead.\"\n\n     My favorite authors are Dr. David H. Keller, Harl Vincent, Lillith\n     Lorraine, Anthony Pelcher, Capt. S. P. Meek, Dr. Miles J. Breuer\n     and Ray Cummings. I can hardly wait a month for my next\n     copy.--Wayne D. Bray, Campbell, Missouri.\n\n\n  _Story Says Cro-Magnons Fled to Europe_\n\n\n  Dear Editor:\n\n     Ever since I was first introduced to Astounding Stories by a cousin\n     I have been a steady reader. I have not missed a single issue so\n     far.\n\n     I hope you will have stories by Hyatt Verril, Edgar Rice Burroughs,\n     Edmond Hamilton, Leslie Stone, Stanton A. Coblentz and Francis\n     Flagg.\n\n     The stories I like best in each issue (not counting serials) are:\n     \"Phantoms of Reality,\" \"Spawn of the Stars,\" \"Vandals of the\n     Stars,\" \"Vampires of Venus\" and \"The Atom Smasher.\" In \"The Atom\n     Smasher\" it says that all Europeans descended from the Atlanteans.\n     Now when the hero killed them all with the disintegrating ray,\n     would he not have affected their birth?\n\n     Wesso is some artist. I saw a mistake on the cover of the March\n     issue. The color of space is a deep black, not blue, because the\n     blue color of the heavens when viewed from the earth is due to the\n     reflection of light by the atmosphere.--George Brande, 141 South\n     Church St., Schenectady, N. Y.\n\n\n  \"_The Readers' Corner_\"\n\nAll Readers are extended a sincere and cordial invitation to \"come over\nin 'The Readers' Corner'\" and join in our monthly discussion of stories,\nauthors, scientific principles and possibilities--everything that's of\ncommon interest in connection with our Astounding Stories.\n\nAlthough from time to time the Editor may make a comment or so, this is\na department primarily for _Readers_, and we want you to make full use\nof it.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
