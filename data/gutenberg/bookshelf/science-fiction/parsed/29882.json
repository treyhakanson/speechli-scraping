Meek_\n\n[Illustration: _Two long arms shot silently down and grasped the\nmotionless figure._]\n\n[Sidenote: Dr. Bird, scientific sleuth extraordinary, goes after a\nsinister stealer of brains.]\n\n\n\"I hope, Carnes,\" said Dr. Bird, \"that we get good fishing.\"\n\n\"Good fishing? Will you please tell me what you are talking about?\"\n\n\"I am talking about fishing, old dear. Have you seen the evening\npaper?\"\n\n\"No. What's that got to do with it?\"\n\nDr. Bird tossed across the table a copy of the _Washington Post_\nfolded so as to bring uppermost an item on page three. Carnes saw his\npicture staring at him from the center of the page.\n\n\"What the dickens?\" he exclaimed as he bent over the sheet. With\ngrowing astonishment he read that Operative Carnes of the United\nStates Secret Service had collapsed at his desk that afternoon and had\nbeen rushed to Walter Reed Hospital where the trouble had been\ndiagnosed as a nervous breakdown caused by overwork. There followed a\nguarded statement from Admiral Clay, the President's personal\nphysician, who had been called into conference by the army\nauthorities.\n\nThe Admiral stated that the Chief of the Washington District was in no\nimmediate danger but that a prolonged rest was necessary. The paper\ngave a glowing tribute to the detective's life and work and stated\nthat he had been given sick leave for an indefinite period and that he\nwas leaving at once for the fishing lodge of his friend, Dr. Bird of\nthe Bureau of Standards, at Squapan Lake, Maine. Dr. Bird, the article\nconcluded, would accompany and care for his stricken friend. Carnes\nlaid aside the paper with a gasp.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Do you know what all this means?\" Carnes demanded.\n\n\"It means, Carnsey, old dear, that the fishing at Squapan Lake should\nbe good right now and that I feel the need of accurate information on\nthe subject. I didn't want to go alone, so I engineered this outrage\non the government and am taking you along for company. For the love of\nMike, look sick from now on until we are clear of Washington. We leave\nto-night. I already have our tickets and reservations and all you have\nto do is to collect your tackle and pack your bags for a month or two\nin the woods and meet me at the Pennsy station at six to-night.\"\n\n\"And yet there are some people who say there is no Santa Claus,\" mused\nCarnes. \"If I had really broken down from overwork, I would probably\nhave had my pay docked for the time I was absent, but a man with\nofficial pull in this man's government wants to go fishing and presto!\nthe wheels move and the way is clear. Doctor, I'll meet you as\ndirected.\"\n\n\"Good enough,\" said Dr. Bird. \"By the way, Carnes,\" he went on as the\noperative opened the door, \"bring your pistol.\"\n\nCarnes whirled about at the words.\n\n\"Are we going on a case?\" he asked.\n\n\"That remains to be seen,\" replied the Doctor enigmatically. \"At all\nevents, bring your pistol. In answer to any questions, we are going\nfishing. In point of fact, we are--with ourselves as bait. If you have\na little time to spare this afternoon you might drop around to the\noffice of the _Post_ and get them to show you all the amnesia cases\nthey have had stories on during the past three months. They will be\ninteresting reading. No more questions now, old dear, we'll have lots\nof time to talk things over while we are in the Maine woods.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLate the next evening they left the Bangor and Aroostook train at\nMesardis and found a Ford truck waiting for them. Over a rough trail\nthey were driven for fifteen miles, winding up at a log cabin which\nthe Doctor announced was his. The truck deposited their belongings and\njounced away and Dr. Bird led the way to the cabin, which proved to be\nunlocked. He pushed open the door and entered, followed by Carnes. The\noperative glanced at the occupants of the cabin and started back in\nsurprise.\n\nSeated at a table were two figures. The smaller of the two had his\nback to the entrance but the larger one was facing them. He rose as\nthey entered and Carnes rubbed his eyes and reeled weakly against the\nwall. Before him stood a replica of Dr. Bird. There was the same six\nfeet two of bone and muscle, the same beetling brows and the same\ncraggy chin and high forehead surmounted by a shock of unruly black\nhair. In face and figure the stranger was a replica of the famous\nscientist until he glanced at their hands. Dr. Bird's hands were long\nand slim with tapering fingers, the hands of a thinker and an artist\ndespite the acid stains which disfigured them but could not hide\ntheir beauty. The hands of his double were stained as were Dr. Bird's,\nbut they were short and thick and bespoke more the man of action than\nthe man of thought.\n\nThe second figure arose and faced them and again Carnes received a\nshock. While the likeness was not so, striking, there was no doubt\nthat the second man would have readily passed for Carnes himself in a\ndim light or at a little distance. Dr. Bird burst into laughter at the\ndetective's puzzled face.\n\n\"Carnes,\" he said, \"shake yourself together and then shake hands with\nMajor Trowbridge of the Coast Artillery Corps. It has been said by\nsome people that we favor one another.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to meet you, Major,\" said Carnes. \"The resemblance is\npositively uncanny. But for your hands, I would have trouble telling\nyou two apart.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Major glanced down at his stubby fingers.\n\n\"It is unfortunate but it can't be helped,\" he said. \"Dr. Bird, this\nis Corporal Askins of my command. He is not as good a second to Mr.\nCarnes as I am to you but you said it was less important.\"\n\n\"The likeness is plenty good enough,\" replied the Doctor. \"He will\nprobably not be subjected to as close a scrutiny as you will. Did you\nhave any trouble in getting here unobserved?\"\n\n\"None at all, Doctor. Lieutenant Maynard found a good landing field\nwithin a half mile of here, as you said he would, and he has his\nDouglass camouflaged and is standing by. When do you expect trouble?\"\n\n\"I have no idea. It may come to-night or it may come later. Personally\nI hope that it comes later so that we can get in a few days of fishing\nbefore anything happens.\"\n\n\"What do you expect to happen, Doctor?\" demanded Carnes. \"Every time I\nhave asked you anything you told me to wait until we were in the\nMaine woods and we are there now. I read up everything that I could\nfind on amnesia victims during the past three months but it didn't\nthrow much light on the matter to me.\"\n\n\"How many cases did you find, Carnes?\"\n\n\"Sixteen. There may have been lots more but I couldn't find any others\nin the _Post_ records. Of course, unless the victim were a local man,\nor of some prominence, it wouldn't appear.\"\n\n\"You got most of them at that. Did any points of similarity strike you\nas you read them?\"\n\n\"None except that all were prominent men and all of them mental\nworkers of high caliber. That didn't appear peculiar because it is the\nman of high mentality who is most apt to crack.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly. There were some points of similarity which you missed.\nWhere did the attacks take place?\"\n\n\"Why, one was at--Thunder, Doctor! I did miss something. Every case,\nas nearly as I can recall, happened at some summer camp or other\nresort where they were on vacation.\"\n\n\"Correct. One other point. At what time of day did they occur?\"\n\n\"In the morning, as well as I can remember. That point didn't\nregister.\"\n\n\"They were all discovered in the morning, Carnes, which means that the\nactual loss of memory occurred during the night. Further, every case\nhas happened within a circle with a diameter of three hundred miles.\nWe are near the northern edge of that circle.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarnes checked up on his memory rapidly.\n\n\"You're right, Doctor,\" he cried. \"Do you think--?\"\n\n\"Once in a while,\" replied Dr. Bird dryly, \"I think enough to know the\nfutility of guesses hazarded without complete data. We are now located\nwithin the limits of the amnesia belt and we are here to find out what\ndid happen, if anything, and not to make wild guesses about it. You\nhave the tent set up for us, Major?\"\n\n\"Yes, Doctor, about thirty yards from the cabin and hidden so well\nthat you could pass it a dozen times a day without suspecting its\nexistence. The gas masks and other equipment which you sent to Fort\nBanks are in it.\"\n\n\"In that case we had better dispense with your company as soon as we\nhave eaten a bite, and retire to it. On second thought, we will eat in\nit. Carnes, we will go to our downy couches at once and leave our\nsubstitutes in possession of the cabin. I trust, gentlemen, that\nthings come out all right and that you are in no danger.\"\n\nMajor Trowbridge shrugged his heavy shoulders.\n\n\"It is as the gods will,\" he said sententiously. \"It is merely a\nmatter of duty to me, you know, and thank God, I have no family to\nmourn if anything does go wrong. Neither has Corporal Askins.\"\n\n\"Well, good luck at any rate. Will you guide Carnes to the tent and\nthen return here and I'll join him?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHuddled in the tiny concealed tent, Dr. Bird handed Carnes a haversack\non a web strap.\n\n\"This is a gas mask,\" he said. \"Put it on your neck and keep it ready\nfor instant use. I have one on and one of us must wear a mask\ncontinually while we are here. We'll change off every hour. If the gas\nused is lethane, as I suspect, we should be able to detect it before\nits gets too concentrated, but some other gas might be used and we\nmust take no chances. Now look here.\"\n\nWith the aid of a flash-light he showed Carnes a piece of apparatus\nwhich had been set up in the tent. It consisted of two telescopic\nbarrels, one fitted with an eye-piece and the other, which was at a\nwide angle to the first, with an objective glass. Between the two was\na covered round disc from which projected a short tube fitted with a\nprotecting lens. This tube was parallel to the telescopic barrel\ncontaining the objective lens.\n\n\"This is a new thing which I have developed and it is getting its\nfirst practical test to-night,\" he said. \"It is a gas detector. It\nworks on the principle of the spectroscope with modifications. From\nthis projector goes out a beam of invisible light and the reflections\nare gathered and thrown through a prism of the eye-piece. While a\nspectroscope requires that the substance which it examines be\nincandescent and throw out visible light rays in order to show the\ntypical spectral lines, this device catches the invisible ultra-violet\non a fluorescent screen and analyzes it spectroscopically. Whoever has\nthe mask on must continually search the sky with it and look for the\nthree bright lines which characterize lethane, one at 230, one at 240\nand the third at 670 on the illuminated scale. If you see any bright\nlines in those regions or any other lines that are not continually\npresent, call my attention to it at once. I'll watch for the first\nhour.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the end of an hour Dr. Bird removed his mask with a sigh of relief\nand Carnes took his place at the spectroscope. For half an hour he\nmoved the glass about and then spoke in a guarded tone.\n\n\"I don't see any of the lines you told me to look for,\" he said, \"but\nin the southwest I get wide band at 310 and two lines at about 520.\"\n\nDr. Bird advanced toward the instrument but before he reached it,\nCarnes gave an exclamation.\n\n\"There they are, Doctor!\" he cried.\n\nDr. Bird sniffed the air. A faint sweetish odor became apparent and he\nreached for his gas mask. Slowly his hands drooped and Carnes grasped\nhim and drew the mask over his face. Dr. Bird rallied slightly and\nfeebly drew a bottle from his pocket and sniffed it. In another\ninstant he was shouldering Carnes aside and staring through the\nspectroscope. Carnes watched him for an instant and then a low whirring\nnoise attracted his attention and he looked up. Silently he caught\nthe Doctor's arm in a viselike grip and pointed.\n\nHovering above the cabin was a silvery globe, faintly luminous in the\nmoonlight. From its top rose a faint cloud of vapor which circled\naround the globe and descended toward the earth. The globe hovered\nlike a giant humming bird above the cabin and Carnes barely stifled an\nexclamation. The door of the cabin opened and Major Trowbridge,\nwalking stiffly and like a man in a dream, appeared. Slowly he\nadvanced for ten yards and stood motionless. The globe moved over him\nand the bottom unfolded like a lily. Two long arms shot silently down\nand grasped the motionless figure and drew him up into the heart of\nthe globe. The petals refolded, and silently as a dream the globe shot\nupward and disappeared.\n\n\"Gad! They lost no time!\" commented Dr. Bird. \"Come on, Carnes, run\nfor your life, or rather, for Trowbridge's life. No, you idiot, leave\nyour gas mask on. I'll take the spectroscope; it'll be all we need.\"\n\nFollowed by the panting Carnes, Dr. Bird sped through the night along\nan almost invisible path. For half a mile he kept up a headlong pace\nuntil Carnes could feel his heart pounding as though it would burst\nhis ribs. The pair debouched from the trees into a glade a few acres\nin extent and Dr. Bird paused and whistled softly. An answering\nwhistle came from a few yards away and a figure rose in the darkness\nas they approached.\n\n\"Maynard?\" called Dr. Bird. \"Good enough! I was afraid that you might\nnot have kept your gas mask on.\"\n\n\"My orders were to keep it on, sir,\" replied the lieutenant in muffled\ntones through his mask, \"but my mechanician did not obey orders. He\npassed out cold without any warning about fifteen minutes ago.\"\n\n\"Where's your ship?\"\n\n\"Right over here, sir.\"\n\n\"We'll take off at once. Your craft is equipped with a Bird\nsilencer?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Come on, Carnes, we're going to follow that globe. Take the front\ncockpit alone, Maynard; Carnes and I will get in the rear pit with the\nspec and guide you. You can take off your gas mask at an elevation of a\nthousand feet. You have pack 'chutes, haven't you?\"\n\n\"In the rear pit, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Put one on, Carnes, and climb in. I've got to get this spec set up\nbefore he gets too high.\"\n\nThe Douglass equipped with the Bird silencer, took the air noiselessly\nand rapidly gained elevation under the urging of the pilot. Dr. Bird\nclamped the gas-detecting spectroscope on the front of his cockpit and\npeered through it.\n\n\"Southwest, at about a thousand more elevation,\" he directed.\n\n\"Right!\" replied the pilot as he turned the nose of his plane in the\nindicated direction and began to climb. For an hour and a half the\nplane flew noiselessly through the night.\n\n\"Bald Mountain,\" said the pilot, pointing. \"The Canadian Border is\nonly a few miles away.\"\n\n\"If they've crossed the Border, we're sunk,\" replied the doctor. \"The\ntrail leads straight ahead.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a few minutes they continued their flight toward the Canadian\nBorder and then Dr. Bird spoke.\n\n\"Swing south,\" he directed, \"and drop a thousand feet and come back.\"\n\nThe pilot executed the maneuver and Dr. Bird peered over the edge of\nthe plane and directed the spectroscope toward the ground.\n\n\"Half a mile east,\" he said, \"and drop another thousand. Carnes, get\nready to jump when I give the word.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord!\" groaned Carnes as he fumbled for the rip cord of his\nparachute, \"suppose this thing doesn't open?\"\n\n\"They'll slide you between two barn doors for a coffin and bury you\nthat way,\" said Dr. Bird grimly. \"You know your orders, Maynard?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. When you drop, I am to land at the nearest town--it will be\nLowell--and get in touch with the Commandant of the Portsmouth Navy\nYard if possible. If I get him, I am to tell him my location and wait\nfor the arrival of reenforcements. If I fail to get him on the\ntelephone, I am to deliver a sealed packet which I carry to the\nnearest United States Marshal. When reenforcements arrive, either from\nthe Navy Yard or from the Marshal, I am to guide them toward the spot\nwhere I dropped you and remain, as nearly as I can judge, two miles\naway until I get a further signal or orders from you.\"\n\n\"That is right. We'll be over the edge in another minute. Are you\nready, Carnes?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I'm ready, Doctor, if I have to risk my precious life in\nthis contraption.\"\n\n\"Then jump!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSide by side, Carnes and the doctor dropped toward the ground. The\nDouglass flew silently away into the night. Carnes found that the\nsensation of falling was not an unpleasant one as soon as he got\naccustomed to it. There was little sensation of motion, and it was not\nuntil a sharp whisper from Dr. Bird called it to his attention that he\nrealized that he was almost to the ground. He bent his legs as he had\nbeen instructed and landed without any great jar. As he rose he saw\nthat Dr. Bird was already on his feet and was eagerly searching the\nground with the spectroscope which he had brought with him in the\njump.\n\n\"Fold your parachute, Carnes, and we'll stow them away under a rock\nwhere they can't be seen. We won't use them again.\"\n\nCarnes did so and deposited the silk bundle beside the doctor's, and\nthey covered them with rocks until they would be invisible from the\nair.\n\n\"Follow me,\" said the doctor as he strode carefully forward, stopping\nnow and then to take a sight with the spectroscope. Carnes followed\nhim as he made his way up a small hill which blocked the way. A hiss\nfrom Dr. Bird stopped him.\n\nDr. Bird had dropped flat on the ground, and Carnes, on all fours,\ncrawled forward to join him. He smothered an exclamation as he looked\nover the crest of the hill. Before him, sitting in a hollow in the\nground, was the huge globe which had spirited away Major Trowbridge.\n\n\"This is evidently their landing place,\" whispered Dr. Bird. \"The next\nthing to find is their hiding place.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe rose and started forward but sank at once to the ground and dragged\nCarnes down with him. On the hill which formed the opposite side of\nthe hollow a line of light showed for an instant as though a door had\nbeen opened. The light disappeared and then reappeared, and as they\nwatched it widened and against an illuminated background four men\nappeared, carrying a fifth. The door shut behind them and they made\ntheir way slowly toward the waiting globe. They laid down their burden\nand one of them turned a flash-light on the globe and opened a door in\nits side through which they hoisted their burden. They all entered the\nglobe, the door closed and with a slight whirring sound it rose in the\nair and moved rapidly toward the northeast.\n\n\"That's the place we're looking for,\" muttered Dr. Bird. \"We'll go\naround this hollow and look for it. Be careful where you step; they\nmust have ventilation somewhere if their laboratory is underground.\"\n\nFollowed by the secret service operative, the doctor made his way\nalong the edge of the hollow. They did not dare to show a light and it\nwas slow work feeling their way forward, inch by inch. When they had\nreached a point above where the doctor thought the light had been he\npaused.\n\n\"There must be a ventilation shaft somewhere around here,\" he\nwhispered, his mouth not an inch from Carnes' ear, \"and we've got to\nfind it. It would never do to try the door; if any of them are still\nhere it is sure to be guarded. You go up the hill for five yards and\nI'll go down. Quarter back and forth on a two hundred yard front and\nwork carefully. Don't fall in, whatever you do. We'll return to this\npoint every time we pass it and report.\"\n\nThe operative nodded and walked a few yards up the hill and made his\nway slowly forward. He went a hundred yards as nearly as he could\njudge and then stepped five yards further up the hill and made his way\nback. As he passed the starting point he approached and Dr. Bird's\nfigure rose up.\n\n\"Any luck?\" he whispered.\n\nDr. Bird shook his head.\n\n\"Well try further,\" he said. \"I think it is probably beyond us, so\nsuppose you go fifteen yards up and quarter the same as before.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarnes nodded and stole silently away. Fifteen yards up the hill he\nwent and then paused. He stood on the crest of the hill and before him\nwas a steep, almost precipitous slope. He made his way along the edge\nfor a few yards and then paused. Faintly he could detect a murmur of\nvoices. Inch by inch he crept forward, going over the ground under\nfoot. He paused and listened intently and decided that the sound must\ncome from the slope beneath him. A glance at his watch told him that\nhe had spent ten minutes on this trip and he made his way back to the\nmeeting place.\n\nDr. Bird was waiting for him, and in a low whisper Carnes reported his\ndiscovery. The doctor went back with him and together they renewed the\nsearch. The slope of the hill was almost sheer and Carnes looked\ndubiously over the edge.\n\n\"I wish we had brought the parachutes,\" he whispered to the doctor.\n\"We could have taken the ropes off them and you could have lowered me\nover the edge.\"\n\nDr. Bird chuckled softly and tugged at his middle. Carnes watched him\nwith astonishment in the dim light, but he understood when Dr. Bird\nthrust the end of a strong but light silk cord into his hands. He\nlooped it under his arms and the doctor with whispered instructions,\nlowered him over the cliff. The doctor lowered him for a few feet and\nthen stopped in response to a jerk on the free end. A moment later\nCarnes signaled to be drawn up and soon stood beside the doctor.\n\n\"That's the place all right,\" he whispered. \"The whole cliff is\ncovered with creepers and there is a tree growing right close to it.\nIf we can anchor the cord here, I think that we can slide down to a\nsafe hold on the tree.\"\n\nA tree stood near and the silk cord was soon fastened. Carnes\ndisappeared over the cliff and in a few moments Dr. Bird slid down the\ncord to join him. He found the detective seated in the crotch of a\ntree only a few feet from the face of the cliff. From the cliff came a\npronounced murmur of voices. Dr. Bird drew in his breath in excitement\nand moved forward along the branch. He touched the stone and after a\nmoment of searching he cautiously raised one corner of a painted\ncanvas flap and peered into the cliff. He watched for a few seconds\nand then slid back and silently pulled Carnes toward him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTogether the two men made their way toward the cliff and Dr. Bird\nraised the corner of the flap and they peered into the hill. Before\nthem was a cave fitted up as a cross between a laboratory and a\nhospital. Almost directly opposite them and at the left of a door in\nthe farther wall was a ray machine of some sort. It was a puzzle to\nCarnes, and even Dr. Bird, although he could grasp the principle at a\nglance, was at a loss to divine its use. From a set of coils attached\nto a generator was connected a tube of the Crookes tube type with the\nrays from it gathered and thrown by a parabolic reflector onto the\nspace where a man's head would rest when he was seated in a white\nmetal chair with rubber insulated feet, which stood beneath it. An\noperating table occupied the other side of the room while a gas\ncylinder and other common hospital apparatus stood around ready for\nuse.\n\nSeated at a table which occupied the center of the room were three\nmen. The sound of their voices rose from an indistinct murmur to\naudibility as the flap was raised and the watchers could readily\nunderstand their words. Two of them sat with their faces toward the\nmain entrance and the third man faced them. Carnes bit his lip as he\nlooked at the man at the head of the table. He was twisted and\nmisshapen in body, a grotesque dwarf with a hunched back, not over\nfour feet in height. His massive head, sunken between his hunched\nshoulders, showed a tremendous dome of cranium and a brow wider and\neven higher than Dr. Bird's. The rest of his face was lined and drawn\nas though by years of acute suffering. Sharp black eyes glared\nbrightly from deep sunk caverns. The dwarf was entirely bald; even the\nbushy eyebrows which would be expected from his face, were missing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"They ought to be getting back,\" said the dwarf sharply.\n\n\"If they get back at all,\" said one of the two figures facing him.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" growled the dwarf, his eyes glittering ominously.\n\"They'll return all right; they know they'd better.\"\n\n\"They'll return if they can, but I tell you again, Slavatsky, I think\nit was a piece of foolishness to try to take two men in one night. We\ngot Bird all right, but it is getting late for a second one, and they\nhad to take Bird over a hundred miles and then go nearly three hundred\nmore for Williams. The news about Bird may have been discovered and\nspread and others may be looking out for us. Carnes might have\nrecovered.\"\n\n\"Didn't he get a full dose of lethane?\"\n\n\"So Frick says, and Bird certainly had a full dose, but I can't help\nbut feel uneasy. Our operations were going too nicely on schedule and\nyou had to break it up and take on an extra case in the same night as\na scheduled one. I tell you, I don't like it.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry that I did it, Carson, but only because the results were so\npoor. We had planned on Williams for a month and I wanted him. And\nBird was so easy that I couldn't resist it.\"\n\n\"And what did you get? Not as much menthium as would have come from an\nordinary bookkeeper.\"\n\n\"I'll admit that Bird is a grossly overrated man. He must have worked\nin sheer luck in his work in the past, for there was nothing in his\nbrain to show it above average. We got barely enough menthium to\nreplace what we used in capturing him.\"\n\n\"We ought to have taken Carnes and left Bird alone,\" snorted Carson.\n\"Even a wooden-headed detective ought to have given us a better supply\nthan Bird yielded.\"\n\n\"We are bound to meet with disappointments once in a while. I had\nmarked Bird down long ago as soon as I could get a chance at him.\"\n\n\"Well, you ran that show, Slavatsky, but I'll warn you that we aren't\ngoing to let you pull off another one like it. I take no more crazy\nchances, even on your orders.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hunchback rose to his feet, his eyes glittering ominously.\n\n\"What do you mean, Carson?\" he asked slowly, his hand slipping behind\nhim as he spoke.\n\n\"Don't try any rough stuff, Slavatsky!\" warned Carson sharply. \"I can\npull a tube as fast as you can, and I'll do it if I have to.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen!\" protested the third man rising, \"we are all\ntoo deep in this to quarrel. Sit down and let's talk this over. Carson\nis just worried.\"\n\n\"What is there to be worried about?\" grunted the dwarf as he slid back\ninto his chair. \"Everything has gone nicely so far and no suspicion\nhas been raised.\"\n\n\"Maybe it has and then again maybe it hasn't,\" growled Carson. \"I\nthink this Bird episode to-night looks bad. In the first place, it\ncame too opportunely and too easily. In the second place Bird should\nhave yielded more menthium, and in the third place, did you notice his\nhands? They weren't the type of hands to expect on a man of his type.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, they were acid stained.\"\n\n\"Acid stains can be put on. It may be all right, but I am worried.\nWhile we are talking about this matter, there is another thing I want\ncleared up.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I think, Slavatsky, that you are holding out on us. You are getting\nmore than your share of the menthium.\"\n\nAgain the dwarf leaped to his feet, but the peace-maker intervened.\n\n\"Carson has a right to look at the records, Slavatsky,\" he said. \"I am\nsatisfied, but I'd like to look at them, too. None of us have seen\nthem for two months.\"\n\nThe dwarf glared at first one and then the other.\n\n\"All right,\" he said shortly and limped to a cabinet on the wall. He\ndrew a key from his pocket and opened it and pulled out a\nleather-bound book. \"Look all you please. I was supposed to get the\nmost. It was my idea.\"\n\n\"You were to get one share and a half, while Willis, Frink and I got\none share each and the rest half a share,\" said Carson. \"I know how\nmuch has been given and it won't take me but a minute to check up.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe bent over the book, but Willis interrupted.\n\n\"Better put it away, Carson,\" he said, \"here come the rest and we\ndon't want them to know we suspect anything.\"\n\nHe pointed toward a disc on the wall which had begun to glow.\nSlavatsky looked at it and grasped the book from Carson and replaced\nit in the cabinet. He moved over and started the generator and the\ntube began to glow with a violet light. A noise came from the outside\nand the door opened. Four men entered carrying a fifth whom they\npropped up in the chair under the glowing tube.\n\n\"Did everything go all right?\" asked the dwarf eagerly.\n\n\"Smooth as silk,\" replied one of the four. \"I hope we get some results\nthis time.\"\n\nThe dwarf bent over the ray apparatus and made some adjustments and\nthe head of the unconscious man was bathed with a violet glow. For\nthree minutes the flood of light poured on his head and then the dwarf\nshut off the light and Carson and Willis lifted the figure and laid it\non the operating table. The dwarf bent over the man and inserted the\nneedle of a hypodermic syringe into the back of the neck at the base\nof the brain. The needle was an extremely long one, and Dr. Bird\ngasped as he saw four inches of shining steel buried in the brain of\nthe unconscious man.\n\nSlowly Slavatsky drew back the plunger of the syringe and Dr. Bird\ncould see it was being filled with an amber fluid. For two minutes the\nslow work continued, until a speck of red appeared in the glass\nsyringe barrel.\n\n\"Seven and a half cubic centimeters!\" cried the dwarf in a tone of\ndelight.\n\n\"Fine!\" cried Carson. \"That's a record, isn't it?\"\n\n\"No, we got eight once. Now hold him carefully while I return some of\nit.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlavatsky slowly pressed home the plunger and a portion of the amber\nfluid was returned to the patient's skull. Presently he withdrew the\nneedle and straightened up and held it toward the light.\n\n\"Six centimeters net,\" he announced. \"Take him back, Frink. I'll give\nCarson and Willis their share now and we'll take care of the rest of\nyou when you return. Is the ship well stocked?\"\n\n\"Enough for two or three more trips.\"\n\n\"In that case, I'll inject this whole lot. Better get going, Frink,\nit's pretty late.\"\n\nThe four men who had brought the patient in stepped forward and lifted\nhim from the table and bore him out. Dr. Bird dropped the canvas\nscreen and strained his ears. A faint whir told him that the globe had\ntaken to the air. He slid back along the limb of the tree until he\ntouched the rope and silently climbed hand over hand until he gained\nthe crest. He bent his back to the task of raising Carnes, and the\noperative soon stood beside him on the ledge surmounting the cliff.\n\n\"What on earth were they doing?\" asked Carnes in a whisper.\n\n\"That was Professor Williams of Yale. They were depriving him of his\nmemory. There will be another amnesia case in the papers to-morrow. I\nhaven't time to explain their methods now: we've got to act. You have\na flash-light?\"\n\n\"Yes, and my gun. Shall we break in? There are only three of them, and\nI think we could handle the lot.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the others may return at any time and we want to bag the\nwhole lot. They've done their damage for to-night. You heard my orders\nto Lieutenant Maynard, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He should be somewhere in these hills to the south with assistance of\nsome sort. The signal to them is three long flashes followed in turn\nby three short ones and three more long. Go and find them and bring\nthem here. When you get close give me the same light signal and don't\ntry to break in unless I am with you. I am going to reconnoitre a\nlittle more and make sure that there is no back entrance through which\nthey can escape. Good luck. Carnes: hurry all you can. There is no\ntime to be lost.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe secret service operative stole away into the night and Dr. Bird\nclimbed back down the rope and took his place at the window. Willis\nlay on the operating table unconscious, while Slavatsky and Carson\nstudied the now partially emptied syringe.\n\n\"You gave him his full share all right,\" Carson was saying. \"I guess\nyou are playing square with us. I'll take mine now.\"\n\nHe lay down on the operating table and the dwarf fitted an anesthesia\ncone over his face and opened the valve of the gas cylinder. In a\nmoment he closed it and rolled the unconscious man on his face and\ndeftly inserted the long needle. Instead of injecting a portion of the\ncontents of the syringe as Dr. Bird had expected to do, he drew back\non the plunger for a minute and then took out the needle and held the\nsyringe to the light.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Carson,\" he said with a malignant glance at the unconscious\nfigure, \"that recovers the dose you got a couple of weeks ago while\nWillis watched me. I don't think you really need any menthium; your\nbrain is too active to suit me as it is.\"\n\nHe gave an evil chuckle and walked to the far side of the cave and\nopened a secret panel. He drew from a recess a flask and carefully\nemptied a portion of the contents of the syringe into it. He replaced\nthe flask and closed the panel, and with another chuckle he limped\nover to a chair and threw himself down in it. For an hour he sat\nmotionless and Dr. Bird carefully worked his way back along the branch\nand climbed the rope and started for the hollow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA faint whirring noise attracted his attention, and he could see the\nfaintly luminous globe in the distance, rapidly approaching. It came\nto a stop at the spot where it had previously landed and four men got\nout. Instead of going toward the cave, they towed the globe, which\nfloated a few inches from the earth, toward the side of the hill\nfarthest from where the doctor stood. Three of them held it, while the\nfourth went forward and bent over some controls on the ground. A\ncreaking sound came through the night and the men moved forward with\nthe globe. Presently its movement stopped and men reappeared. Again\ncame the creaking sound and the glow faded out as though a screen had\nbeen drawn in front of it. The four men walked toward the door of the\ncave.\n\nDr. Bird dropped flat on the ground and saw them pause a few yards\nbelow him on the hill and again work some hidden controls. A glare of\nlight showed for an instant and they disappeared and everything was\nagain quiet. Dr. Bird debated the advisability of returning to the\nwindow but decided against it and moved down the face of the hill.\n\nInch by inch he went over the ground, but found nothing. In the\ndarkness he could not locate the door and he made his way around to\nthe back of the hill. The precipice loomed above him and he swept it\nwith his gaze, but he could locate no opening in the darkness and he\ndared not use a flash-light. As he turned he faced the east and noted\nwith a start of surprise that the sky was getting red. He glanced at\nhis watch and found that Carnes had been gone for nearly three hours.\n\n\"Great Scott!\" he exclaimed in surprise. \"Time has gone faster than I\nrealized. He ought to be back at any time now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe mounted the highest point of the hill and sent three long flashes,\nfollowed in turn by three short and three more long to the south and\nwatched eagerly for an answer. He waited five minutes and repeated the\nsignal, but no answering flashes came from the empty hills. With a\ngrunt which might have meant anything, he turned and made his way\ntoward the opposite side of the hollow where the globe had\ndisappeared. Here he met with more luck. He had marked the location\nwith extreme care and he had not spent over twenty minutes feeling\nover the ground before his hand encountered a bit of metal. As he\npulled on it his eyes sought the side of the hill.\n\nThe dawn had grown sufficiently bright for him to see the result of\nhis action. A portion of the hill folded back and the faintly glowing\nship became visible. With a muttered exclamation of triumph he\napproached it.\n\nThe globe was about nine feet in diameter and was without visible\ndoors or windows. Around and around it the doctor went, searching for\nan entrance. The ship now rested solidly on the ground. He failed to\nfind what he sought and his sensitive hands began to go over it\nsearching for an irregularity. He had covered nearly half of it before\nhis finger found a hidden button and pressed it. Silently a door in\nthe side of the craft opened and he advanced to enter.\n\n\"Keep them up!\" said a sharp voice behind him.\n\nDr. Bird froze into instant immobility and the voice spoke again.\n\n\"Turn around!\"\n\nDr. Bird turned and looked full into the eye of a revolver held by the\nman the dwarf had addressed as Frink. Behind Frink stood the dwarf and\nthree other men.\n\nAs his eye fell on Dr. Bird, Frink turned momentarily pale and\nstaggered back, the revolver wavering as he did so. Dr. Bird made a\nlightning-like grab for his own weapon, but before he could draw it\nFrink had recovered and the revolver was again steady.\n\n\"Dr. Bird!\" gasped Slavatsky. \"Impossible!\"\n\n\"Get his gun, Harris,\" said Frink.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the men stepped forward and dextrously removed the doctor's\nautomatic and frisked him expertly to insure himself that he had no\nother weapon concealed.\n\n\"Bring him to the cave,\" directed Slavatsky, who, though obviously\nstill shaken, had just as obviously recovered enough to be a very\ndangerous man. Two of the men grasped the doctor and led him along\ntoward the entrance to the laboratory cave which stood wide open in\nthe gathering daylight. Frink paused long enough to shut the side of\nthe hill and conceal the ship, and then followed the doctor. In the\ncave the door was shut and the doctor placed against the wall under\nthe window through which he had peered earlier in the night. Slavatsky\ntook his seat at the table, his malignant black eyes boring into the\nDoctor. Carson and Willis sat on the edge of the operating table,\nevidently still partially under the effects of the anesthetic that had\nbeen administered to them.\n\n\"How did you get back here?\" demanded Slavatsky.\n\n\"Find out!\" snapped Dr. Bird.\n\nThe dwarf rose threateningly.\n\n\"Speak respectfully to me; I am the Master of the World!\" he roared in\nan angry voice. \"Answer my questions when I speak, or means will be\nfound to make you answer. How did you get back here?\"\n\nDr. Bird maintained a stubborn silence, his fierce eyes answering the\ndwarf's, look for look, and his prominent chin jutting out a little\nmore squarely. Carson suddenly broke the silence.\n\n\"That's not the Bird we had here earlier,\" he cried as he staggered to\nhis feet.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" demanded Slavatsky whirling on him.\n\n\"Look at his hands!\" replied Carson pointing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlavatsky looked at Dr. Bird's long mobile fingers and an evil leer\ncame over his countenance.\n\n\"So, Dr. Bird,\" he said slowly, \"you thought to match wits with Ivan\nSlavatsky, the greatest mind of all the ages. For a time you fooled me\nwhen your double was operated on here, but not for long. I presume you\nthought that we had no way of detecting the substitution? You have\ndiscovered differently. Where is your friend, Mr. Carnes?\"\n\n\"Didn't your men leave him in the cabin when you kidnapped me?\"\n\nSlavatsky looked at Frink inquiringly.\n\n\"He stayed in the cabin if he was in it when we got there,\" the leader\nof the kidnapping gang replied. \"He got a full shot of lethane and\nhe's due to be asleep yet. I don't know how this man recovered. I left\nhim there myself.\"\n\n\"Fool!\" shrieked Slavatsky. \"You brought me a double, a dummy whom I\nwasted my time in operating on. Was the other a dummy, too?\"\n\n\"I didn't enter the cabin.\"\n\nSlavatsky shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"If that is all the good the menthium I have injected has done you, I\nmight as well have saved it. It doesn't matter, however: we have the\none we wanted. Dr. Bird, it was very thoughtful of you to come here\nand offer your marvelous brain to strengthen mine. I have no doubt\nthat you will yield even more menthium than Professor Williams did\nthis evening especially as I will extract your entire supply and\nreduce you to permanent idiocy. I will have no mercy on you as I have\non the others I have operated on.\"\n\nDr. Bird blanched in spite of himself at the ominous words.\n\n\"You have the whip-hand for the moment, Slavatsky, but my time may\ncome--and if it does, I will remember your kindness. I saw your\noperation on Professor Williams this evening and know your power. I\nalso know that you stole the idea and the method from Sweigert of\nVienna. I saw you inject the fluid you drew into Willis' brain. Shall\nI tell what else I saw?\"\n\nIt was the dwarf's turn to blanch, but he recovered himself quickly.\n\n\"Into the chair with him!\" he roared.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree of the men grasped the doctor and forced him into the chair and\nSlavatsky started the generator. The violet light bathed Dr. Bird's head\nand he felt a stiffness and contraction of his neck muscles, and as he\ntried to shout out his knowledge of Slavatsky's treachery, he found that\nhis vocal chords were paralyzed. Through a gathering haze he could see\nCarson approaching with an anesthesia cone and the sweet smell of lethane\nassailed his nostrils. He fought with all his force, but strong hands held\nhim, and he felt himself slipping--slipping--slipping--and then falling\ninto an immense void. His head slumped forward on his chest and Slavatsky\nshut off the generator.\n\n\"On the table,\" he said briefly.\n\nFour men picked up the herculean frame of the unconscious doctor and\nhoisted him up on the table. Carson seized his head and bent it\nforward and the dwarf took from a case a syringe with a five-inch\nneedle. He touched the point of it to the base of the doctor's brain.\n\n\"Slavatsky! Look!\" cried Frink.\n\nWith an exclamation of impatience the dwarf turned and stared at a\ndisc set on the wall of the cave. It was glowing brightly. With an\noath he dropped the syringe and snapped a switch, plunging the cave\ninto darkness. A tiny panel in the door opened to his touch and he\nstared out into the light.\n\n\"Soldiers!\" he gasped. \"Quick, the back way!\"\n\nAs he spoke there came a sound as of a heavy body falling at the back\nof the cave. Slavatsky turned the switch and flooded the cave with\nlight. At the back of the cave stood Operative Carnes, an automatic\npistol in his hand.\n\n\"Open the main door!\" Carnes snapped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlavatsky made a move toward the light, and Carnes' gun roared\ndeafeningly in the confined space. The heavy bullet smashed into the\nwall an inch from the dwarf's hand and he started back.\n\n\"Open the main door!\" ordered Carnes again.\n\nThe men stared at one another for a moment and the dwarf's eyes fell.\n\n\"Open the door, Frink,\" he said.\n\nFrink moved over to a lever. He glanced at Slavatsky and a momentary\ngleam of intelligence passed between them. Frink raised his hand\ntoward the lever and Carnes gun roared again and Frink's arm fell limp\nfrom a smashed shoulder.\n\n\"Slavatsky,\" said Carnes sternly, \"come here!\"\n\nSlowly the dwarf approached.\n\n\"Turn around!\" said Carnes.\n\nHe turned and felt the cold muzzle of Carnes' gun against the back of\nhis neck.\n\n\"Now tell one of your men to open the door,\" said the detective. \"If\nhe promptly obeys your order, you are safe. If he doesn't, you die.\"\n\nSlavatsky hesitated for a moment, but the cold muzzle of the automatic\nbored into the back of his neck and when he spoke it was in a\nquavering whine.\n\n\"Open the door, Carson,\" he whimpered.\n\nThere was moment of pause.\n\n\"If that door isn't open by the time I count three,\" said Carnes,\n\"--as far as Slavatsky is concerned, it's just too bad. I'll have four\nshots left--and I'm a dead shot at this range. One! Two!\"\n\nHis lips framed the word \"three\" and his fingers were tightening on\nthe trigger when Carson jumped forward with an oath. He pulled a lever\non the wall and the door swung open. Carnes shouted and through the\nopened door came a half dozen marines followed by an officer.\n\n\"Tie these men up!\" snapped Carnes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a trice the six men were securely bound and Frink's bleeding\nshoulder was being skilfully treated by two of the marines. Carnes\nturned his attention to the unconscious doctor.\n\nHe rolled him over on his back and began to chafe his hands. An\nofficer in a naval uniform came through the door and with a swift\nglance around, bent over Dr. Bird. He raised one of the doctor's\neyelids and peered closely at his eye and then sniffed at his breath.\n\n\"It's some anesthetic I don't know,\" he said. \"I'll try a stimulant.\"\n\nHe reached in his pocket for a hypodermic, but Carnes interrupted him.\n\n\"Earlier in the evening Dr. Bird said they were using lethane,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Oh, that new gas the Chemical Warfare Service has discovered,\" said\nthe surgeon. \"In that case I guess it'll just have to wear off. I know\nof nothing that will neutralize it.\"\n\nWithout replying, Carnes began to feverishly search the pockets of the\nunconscious scientist. With an exclamation of triumph he drew out a\nbottle and uncorked it. A strong smell as of garlic penetrated the\nroom and he held the opened bottle under Dr. Bird's nose. The doctor\nlay for a moment without movement, and then he coughed and sat up half\nstrangled with tears running down his face.\n\n\"Take that confounded bottle away, Carnes!\" he said. \"Do you want to\nstrangle me?\"\n\nHe sat up and looked around.\n\n\"What happened?\" he demanded. \"Oh, yes, I remember now. That brute was\nabout to operate on me. How did you get here?\"\n\n\"Never mind that, Doctor. Are you all right?\"\n\n\"Right as a trivet, old dear. How did you get here so opportunely?\"\n\n\"I was a little slow in locating Lieutenant Maynard and the marines.\nWhen we got here I was afraid that we couldn't find the door, so I\ntook Maynard and a detail around to the back and I went up to the top\nand slid down our cord and looked in the window. You were unconscious\nand Slavatsky was bending over you with a needle in his hand. I was\nabout to try a shot at him when something called their attention to\nthe men in front and I squeezed through the window and dropped in on\nthem. They didn't seem any too glad to see me, but I overlooked that\nand insisted on inviting the rest of my friends in to share in the\nparty. That's all.\"\n\n\"Carnes,\" said the Doctor, \"you're probably lying like a trooper when\nyou make out that you did nothing, but I'll pry the truth out of you\nsooner or later. Now I've got to get to work. Send for Lieutenant\nMaynard.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the marines went out to get the flyer, and Dr. Bird stepped to\nthe cabinet from which Slavatsky had taken his record book earlier in\nthe evening and took out the leather-bound volume. He opened it and\nhad started to read when Lieutenant Maynard entered the cave.\n\n\"Hello, Maynard,\" said the Doctor, looking up. \"Are the rest of the\nparty on their way?\"\n\n\"They will be here in less than two hours, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Good enough! Have some one sent to guide them here. In the meanwhile,\nI'm going to study these records. Keep the prisoners quiet. If they\nmake a noise, gag them. I want to concentrate.\"\n\nFor an hour and a half silence reigned in the cave. A stir was heard\noutside and Admiral Clay, the President's personal physician, entered\nleading a stout gray-haired man. Dr. Bird whistled when he saw them\nand leaped to his feet as another figure followed the admiral.\n\n\"The President!\" gasped Carnes as the officers came to a salute and\nthe marines presented arms.\n\nThe President nodded to his ex-guard, acknowledged the salute of the\nrest and turned to Dr. Bird.\n\n\"Have you met with success, Doctor?\" he asked.\n\n\"I have, Mr. President; or, rather, I hope that I have. At the same\ntime, I would rather experiment on some other victim of their deviltry\nthan the one you have brought me.\"\n\n\"My decision that the one I have brought shall be the first to be\nexperimented on, as you term it, is unalterable.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird bowed and turned to the dwarf who had been a sullen witness\nof what had gone on.\n\n\"Slavatsky,\" he said slowly, \"your game is up. I have witnessed one of\nyour brain transfusions and I know the method. I gather from your\nnotes that the menthium you have hidden in that cabinet is still as\npotent as when it was first extracted from a living brain, but in this\ncase I am going to draw it fresh from one of your gang. Some of the\ndetails of the operation are a little hazy to me, but those you will\nteach me. I am going to restore this man to the condition he was in\nbefore you did your devil's work on him and you will direct my\nmovements. Just what is the first step in removing the menthium from a\nbrain?\"\n\nThe dwarf maintained a stubborn silence.\n\n\"You refuse to answer?\" asked the Doctor in feigned surprise. \"I\nthought that you would rather instruct me and have me try the\noperation first on other men. Since you prefer that I operate on you\nfirst, I will be glad to do so.\"\n\nHe stepped to the opposite wall and in a few moments had opened the\ndwarf's hiding place and taken out the flask of menthium.\n\n\"Carson,\" he said, \"after you had watched Slavatsky inject menthium\ninto Willis, you took lethane and expected him to inject menthium into\nyour brain. Instead of doing so he withdrew a portion from your brain\nand put it in this flask. I have reason to believe from his secret\nrecords which I found in the cabinet with this flask that he has done\nso regularly. Are you willing to instruct me while I remove the\nmenthium from him?\"\n\n\"The dirty swine!\" shouted Carson. \"I'll do anything to get even with\nhim, but I have never performed the operation. Only Slavatsky and\nWillis have operated.\"\n\n\"Will you help me, Willis? asked Dr. Bird.\n\n\"I'll be glad to, Doctor. I am sick of this business anyway. At first,\nSlavatsky just planned to give us abnormally keen brains, but lately\nhe has been talking of setting himself up as Emperor of the World, and\nI am sick of it. I think I would have broken with him and told all I\nknow, soon, anyway.\"\n\n\"Throw him in that chair,\" said Dr. Bird.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDespite the howlings and strugglings of the dwarf, three of the\nmarines strapped him in the chair beneath the tube. The dwarf howled\nand frothed at the mouth and directed a final appeal for mercy to the\nPresident.\n\n\"Spare me, Your Excellency,\" he howled. \"I will put my brains at your\nservice and make you the greatest mentality of all time. Together we\ncan conquer and rule the world. I will show you how to build hundreds\nof ships like mine--\"\n\nThe President turned his back on the dwarf and spoke curtly.\n\n\"Proceed with your experiments, Dr. Bird,\" he said.\n\nSlavatsky directed his appeals to the doctor, who peremptorily\nsilenced him.\n\n\"I told you a few hours ago, Slavatsky, that the time might come when\nI would remember your threats against me. I will show you the same\nmercy now as you promised me then. Carnes, put a cone over his face.\"\n\nDespite the howls of the dwarf, the operative forced an anesthesia\ncone over his face and Dr. Bird turned to the valve of the lethane\ncylinder. With Willis directing his movements, he turned on the ray\nfor three minutes and removed the unconscious dwarf to the operating\ntable. He took the long-needled syringe from a case and sterilized it\nand then turned to the President.\n\n\"I am about to operate,\" he said, \"but before I do so, I wish to\nexplain to all just what I have learned and what I am about to do.\nWith that data, the decision of whether I shall proceed will rest with\nyou and Admiral Clay. Have I your permission to do so?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe President nodded.\n\n\"When I first read of these amnesia cases, I took them for\ncoincidences--until you consulted me and gave me an opportunity to\nexamine one of the victims. I found a small puncture at the base of\nthe brain which I could not explain, and I began to dig into old\nrecords. I knew, of course, of Sweigert of Vienna, and the extravagant\nclaims he had put forward in 1911. He was far ahead of his time, but\nhe mixed up some profound scientific discoveries with mysticism and\noccultism until he was discredited. Nevertheless, he continued his\nexperiments with the aid of his principal assistant, a man named\nSlavatsky.\n\n\"Sweigert's theory was that intellectuality, brain power,\nintelligence, call it what you will, was the result of the presence of\na fluid which he called 'menthium' in the brain. He thought that it\ncould be transferred from one person to another, and with the aid of\nSlavatsky, he experimented on himself. He removed the menthium from an\nunfortunate victim, who was reduced to a state of imbecility, and\nSlavatsky injected the substance into Sweigert's brain. The experiment\nresulted fatally and Slavatsky was tried for murder. He was acquitted\nof intentional murder but was imprisoned for a time for manslaughter.\nHe was released when the Austro-Hungarian Empire was broken up, and\nfor a time I lost track of him.\n\n\"I found translations of both the records of the trials and of\nSweigert's original reports, and the thing that attracted my attention\nwas that the puncture I found in the victim corresponded exactly with\nthe puncture described by Sweigert as the one he made in extracting\nthe menthium. I asked the immigration authorities to check over their\nrecords and they found that a man named Slavatsky whose description\ncorresponded with the ill-fated Sweigert's assistant had entered the\nUnited States under Austria's quota about a year ago. The chain of\nevidence seemed complete to me, and it only remained to find the man\nwho was systematically robbing brains.\n\n\"If such a thing was really going on, I felt that my reputation would\nmake me an attractive bait and I secured a double, as you know, and\nplaced him in a position where his kidnapping would be an easy matter.\nI was sure that the victims were being taken away by air and that\nlethane was being used to reduce the neighborhood to a state of\nprofound somnolence, so I hid myself near my double with a gas\ndetector which would find even minute traces of lethane in the air.\n\n\"My fish rose to the lure and came after the bait last night. When his\nship arrived, I found a strange gas in the air, and followed the ship\nby the trail of the substance which it left behind it. Carnes was with\nme, and we got here in time to witness the extraction of the menthium\nfrom my friend, Professor Williams of Yale, and to see it injected\ninto one of Slavatsky's gang. I sent Carnes for help and messed around\nuntil I was captured myself--and help arrived just in time. That's\nabout all there is to tell. I am now about to reverse the process and\ntry to remove the stolen brains from the criminals and restore them to\ntheir rightful owners. I have never operated and the result may be\nfatal. Shall I proceed?\"\n\nThe President and Admiral Clay consulted for a moment in undertones.\n\n\"Go on with your experiments, Dr. Bird,\" said the President, \"and we\nwill hold you blameless for a failure. You have worked so many\nmiracles in the past that we have every confidence in you.\"\n\nDr. Bird bowed acknowledgment to the compliment and bent over the\nunconscious dwarf. With Willis directing every move, he inserted the\nneedle and drew back slowly on the plunger. Twenty-three and one-half\ncubic centimeters of amber fluid flowed into the syringe before a\nspeck of blood appeared.\n\n\"Enough!\" cried Willis. Dr. Bird withdrew the syringe and motioned to\nAdmiral Clay. The man the Admiral had brought in was placed in the\nchair and lethane administered. He was laid on the table, and, with a\nsilent prayer, Dr. Bird inserted the needle and pressed the plunger.\nWhen five and one-quarter centimeters had flowed into the man's\nbrains, he withdrew the needle and held the bottle which Carnes had\nused to revive him under the man's nose. The patient coughed a moment\nand sat up.\n\n\"Where am I?\" he demanded. His gaze roved the cave and fell on the\nPresident. \"Hello, Robert,\" he exclaimed. \"What has happened?\"\n\nWith a cry of joy the President sprang forward and wrung the hand of\nthe man.\n\n\"Are you all right, William?\" he asked anxiously. \"Do you feel\nperfectly normal?\"\n\n\"Of course I do. My neck feels a little stiff. What are you talking\nabout? Why shouldn't I feel normal? How did I get here?\"\n\n\"Take him outside, Admiral, and explain to him,\" said the President.\n\nAdmiral Clay led the puzzled man outside and the President turned to\nDr. Bird.\n\n\"Doctor,\" he said, \"I need not tell you that I again add my personal\ngratitude to the gratitude of a nation which would be yours, could the\nmiracles you work be told off. If there is ever any way that can serve\nyou, either personally or officially, do not hesitate to ask. The\nother victims will be brought here to-day. Will you be able to restore\nthem?\"\n\n\"I will, Mr. President. From Slavatsky's records I find that I will\nhave enough if I reduce all of his men to a state of imbecility except\nWillis. In view of his assistance, I propose to leave him with enough\nmenthium to give him the intelligence of an ordinary schoolboy.\"\n\n\"I quite approve of that,\" said the President as Willis humbly\nexpressed his gratitude. \"Have you had time to make an examination of\nthat ship of Slavatsky's, yet?\"\n\n\"I have not. As soon as the work of restoration is completed, I will\ngo over it, and when I master the principles I will be glad to take\nthem up with the Army-Navy General Board.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Doctor,\" said the President. He shook hands heartily and\nleft the cave. Carnes turned and looked at the Doctor.\n\n\"Will you answer a question, Doctor?\" he asked. \"Ever since this case\nstarted, I have been wondering at your extraordinary powers. You have\nordered the army, the navy, the department of justice and everyone\nelse around as though you were an absolute monarch. I know the\nPresident was behind you, but what puzzles me is how he came to be so\nvitally interested in the case.\"\n\nDr. Bird smiled quizzically at the detective.\n\n\"Even the secret service doesn't know everything,\" he said. \"Evidently\nyou didn't recognize the man whose memory I restored. Besides being\none of the most brilliant corporation executives in the country, he\nhas another unique distinction. He happens to be the only brother of\nthe President of the United States.\"\n\n[Advertisement: ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Invisible Death\n\nA COMPLETE NOVELETTE\n\n_By Victor Rousseau_\n\n[Illustration: Far overhead a luminous shape appeared.]\n\n[Sidenote: With night-rays and darkness-antidote America strikes back\nat the terrific and destructive Invisible Empire.]\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n_Out of the Hangman's Hands_\n\n\n\"You speak,\" said Von Kettler, jeering, \"as if you really believed\nthat you had the power of life and death over me.\"\n\nThe Superintendent of the penitentiary frowned, yet there was\nsomething of perplexity in the look he gave the prisoner. \"Von\nKettler, I think it is time that you dropped this absurd pose of\nyours,\" he said, \"in view of the fact that you are scheduled to die by\nhanging at eight o'clock to-morrow night. Your life and death are in\nyour own hands.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nVon Kettler bowed ironically. Standing in the Superintendent's\npresence in the uniform of the condemned cell, collarless,\nbare-headed, he yet seemed to dominate the other by a certain poise,\nbreeding, nonchalance.\n\n\"Your life is offered you in consideration of your making a complete\nwritten confession of the whole ramifications of the plot against the\nFederal Government,\" the Superintendent continued.\n\n\"Rather a confession of weakness, my dear Superintendent,\" jeered the\nprisoner.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Oh don't worry about that! The Government has unravelled a good deal\nof the conspiracy. It knows that you and your international associates\nare planning to strike at civilized government throughout the world,\nin the effort to restore the days of autocracy. It knows you are\nplanning a world federation of states, based on the principles of\nabsolutism and aristocracy. It is aware of the immense financial\nresources behind the movement. Also that you have obtained the use of\ncertain scientific discoveries which you believe will aid you in your\nschemes.\"\n\n\"I was wondering,\" jeered the prisoner, \"how soon you were coming to\nthat.\"\n\n\"They didn't help you in your murderous scheme,\" the Superintendent\nthundered. \"You were found in the War Office by the night watchman,\nrifling a safe of valuable documents. You shot him with a pistol\nequipped with a silencer. You shot down two more who, hearing his\ncries, rushed to his aid. And you attempted to stroll out of the\nbuilding, apparently under the belief that you possessed mysterious\npower which would afford you security.\"\n\n\"A little lapse of judgment such as may happen with the best laid\nplans,\" smiled Von Kettler. \"No, Superintendent, I'll be franker with\nyou than that. My capture was designed. It was decided to give the\nGovernment an object lesson in our power. It was resolved that I\nshould permit myself to be captured, in order to demonstrate that you\ncannot hang me, that I have merely to open the door of my cell, the\ngates of this penitentiary, and walk out to freedom.\"\n\n\"Have you quite finished?\" rasped the Superintendent.\n\n\"At your disposal,\" smiled the other.\n\n\"Here's your last chance, Von Kettler. Your persistence in this absurd\nclaim has actually shaken the expressed conviction of some of the\nmedical examiners that you are sane. If you will make that complete\nwritten confession that the Government asks of you, I pledge you that\nyou shall be declared insane to-night, and sent to a sanitarium from\nwhich you will be permitted to escape as soon as this affair has blown\nover.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The United States Government has sunk pretty low, to involve itself\nin a deal of this character, don't you think, my dear Superintendent?\"\njeered Von Kettler.\n\n\"The Government is prepared to act as it thinks best in the interests\nof humanity. It knows that the death of one wretched murderer such as\nyourself is not worth the lives of thousands of innocent men!\"\n\n\"And there,\" smiled Von Kettler, without abating an atom of his\nnonchalance, \"there, my dear Superintendent, you hit the nail on the\nhead. Only, instead of thousands, you might have said millions.\"\n\nVon Kettler's aspect changed. Suddenly his eyes blazed, his voice\nshook with excitement, his face was the face of a fanatic, of a\nprophet.\n\n\"Yes, millions, Superintendent,\" he thundered. \"It it a holy cause\nthat inspires us. We know that it is our sacred mission to save the\nworld from the drabness of modern democracy. The people--always the\npeople! Bah! what are the lives of these swarming millions worth when\ncompared with a Caesar, a Napoleon, an Alexander, a Charlemagne?\nNothing can stop us or defeat us. And you, with your confession of\ndefeat, your petty bargaining--I laugh at you!\"\n\n\"You'll laugh on the gallows to-morrow night!\" the Superintendent\nshouted.\n\nAgain Von Kettler was the calm, superior, arrogant prisoner of before.\n\"I shall never stand on the gallows trap, my dear Superintendent, as I\nhave told you many times,\" he replied. \"And, since we have reached\nwhat diplomacy calls a deadlock, permit me to return to my cell.\"\n\nThe Superintendent pressed a button on his desk; the guards, who had\nbeen waiting outside the office, entered hastily. \"Take this man\nback,\" he commanded, and Von Kettler, head held high, and smiling,\nleft the room between them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Superintendent pressed another button, and his assistant entered,\na rugged, red-haired man of forty--Anstruther, familiarly known as\n\"Bull\" Anstruther, the man who had in three weeks reduced the\npenitentiary from a place of undisciplined chaos to a model of law\nand order. Anstruther knew nothing of the Superintendent's offer to\nVon Kettler, but he knew that the latter had powerful friends outside.\n\n\"Anstruther, I'm worried about Von Kettler,\" said the Superintendent.\n\"He actually laughed at me when I spoke of the possibility of another\nmedical examination. He seemed confident that he could not be hanged.\nSwore that he will never stand on the gallows trap. How about your\nprecautions for to-morrow night?\"\n\n\"We've taken all possible precautions,\" answered Anstruther. \"Special\narmed guards have been posted at every entrance to the building.\nDetectives are patrolling all streets leading up to it. Every car that\npasses is being scrutinized, its plate numbers taken, and forwarded to\nthe Motor Bureau. There's no chance of even an attempt at\nrescue--literally none.\"\n\n\"He's insane,\" said the Superintendent, with conviction, and the words\nfilled him with new confidence. It had been less Von Kettler's\nstatements than the man's cool confidence and arrogant superiority\nthat had made him doubt. \"But he's not too insane to have known what\nhe was doing. He'll hang.\"\n\n\"He certainly will,\" replied Anstruther. \"He's just a big bluff, sir.\"\n\n\"Have him searched rigorously again to-morrow morning, and his cell\ntoo--every inch of it, Anstruther. And don't relax an iota of your\nprecautions. I'll be glad when it's all over.\"\n\nHe proceeded to hold a long-distance conversation with Washington over\na special wire.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn his cell, Von Kettler could be seen reading a book. It was\nNietzsche's \"Thus Spake Zarathusta,\" that compendium of aristocratic\ninsolence that once took the world by storm, until the author's\nmentality was revealed by his commitment to a mad-house. Von Kettler\nread till midnight, closely observed by the guard at the trap, then\nlaid the word aside with a yawn, lay down on his cot, and appeared to\nfall instantly asleep.\n\nDawn broke. Von Kettler rose, breakfasted, smoked the perfecto that\ncame with his ham and eggs, resumed his book. At ten o'clock Bull\nAnstruther came with a guard and stripped him to the skin, examining\nevery inch of his prison garments. The bedding followed; the cell was\ngone over microscopically. Von Kettler, permitted to dress again,\nsmiled ironically. That smile stirred Anstruther's gall.\n\n\"We know you're just a big bluff, Von Kettler,\" snarled the big man.\n\"Don't think you've got us going. We're just taking the usual\nprecautions, that's all.\"\n\n\"So unnecessary,\" smiled Von Kettler. \"To-night I shall dine at the\nAmbassador grill. Watch for me there. I'll leave a memento.\"\n\nAnstruther went out, choking. Early in the afternoon two guards came\nfor Von Kettler.\n\n\"Your sister's come to say good-by to you,\" he was told, as he was\ntaken to the visitors' cell.\n\nThis was a large and fairly comfortable cell in a corridor leading off\nthe death house, designed to impress visitors with the belief that it\nwas the condemned man's permanent abode; and, by a sort of convention,\nit was understood that prisoners were not to disabuse their visitors'\nminds of the idea. The convention had been honorably kept. The\nvisitor's approach was checked by a grill, with a two-yards space\nbetween it and the bars of the cell. Within this space a guard was\nseated: it was his duty to see that nothing passed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs soon as Von Kettler had been temporarily established in his new\nquarters, a pretty, fair-haired young woman came along the corridor,\nconducted by the Superintendent himself. She walked with dignity, her\nbearing was proud, she smiled at her brother through the grill, and\nthere was no trace of weeping about her eyes.\n\nShe bowed with pretty formality, and Von Kettler saluted her with an\nairy wave of the hand. Then they began to speak, and the German guard\nwho had been selected for the purpose of interpreting to the\nSuperintendent afterward, was baffled.\n\nIt was not German--neither was it French, Italian, or any of the\nRomance languages. As a matter of fact, it was Hungarian.\n\nNot until the half-hour was up did they lapse into English, and all\nthe while they might have been conversing on art, literature, or\nsport. There was no hint of tragedy in this last meeting.\n\n\"Good-by, Rudy,\" smiled his sister, \"I'll see you soon.\"\n\n\"To-night or to-morrow,\" replied Von Kettler indifferently.\n\nThe girl blew him a kiss. She seemed to detach it from her mouth and\nextend it through the grill with a graceful gesture of the hand, and\nVon Kettler caught it with a romantic wave of the fingers and strained\nit to his heart. But it was only one of those queer foreign ways.\nNothing was passed. The alert guard, sitting under the electric light,\nwas sure of that.\n\nThey searched Von Kettler again after he was back in the death house.\nThe other cells were empty. In three of them detectives were placed.\nIn the yard beyond the hangman was experimenting with the trap. He\nhimself was under close observation. Nothing was being left to chance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt seven o'clock two men collided in the death-house entrance. One was\na guard, carrying Von Kettler's last meal on a tray. He had demanded\nPerigord truffles and pat\u00e9 de foie gras, cold lobster, endive salad,\nand near-beer, and he had got them. The other was the chaplain, in a\nstate of visible agitation.\n\n\"If he was an atheist and mocked at me it wouldn't be so bad,\" the\ngood man declared. \"I've had plenty of that kind. But he says he's not\ngoing to be hanged. He's mad, mad as a March hare. The Government has\nno right to send an insane man to the gallows.\"\n\n\"All bluff, my dear Mr. Wright,\" answered the Superintendent, when the\nchaplain voiced his protest. \"He thinks he can get away with it. The\ncommission has pronounced him sane, and he must pay the penalty of his\ncrime.\"\n\nBy that mysterious process of telegraphy that exists in all penal\ninstitutions, Von Kettler's boast that he would beat the hangman had\nbecome the common information of the inmates. Bets were being laid,\nand the odds against Von Kettler ranged from ten to fifteen to one. It\nwas generally agreed, however, that Von Kettler would die game to the\nlast.\n\n\"You all ready, Mr. Squires?\" the prowling Superintendent asked the\nhangman.\n\n\"Everything's O. K., sir.\"\n\nThe Superintendent glanced at the group of newspaper men gathered\nabout the gallows. They, too, had heard of the prisoner's boast. One\nof them asked him a question. He silenced him with an angry look.\n\n\"The prisoner is in his cell, and will be led out in ten minutes. You\nshall see for yourselves how much truth there it in this absurdity,\"\nhe said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked at his watch. It lacked five minutes of eight. The\npreparations for an execution had been reduced almost to a formula.\nOne minute in the cell, twenty seconds to the trap, forty seconds for\nthe hangman to complete his arrangements: two minutes, and then the\nthud of the false floor.\n\nFour minutes of eight. The little group had fallen silent. The hangman\nfurtively took a drink from his hip-pocket flask. Three minutes! The\nSuperintendent walked back to the door of the death house and nodded\nto the guard.\n\n\"Bring him out quick!\" he said.\n\nThe guard shot the bolt of Von Kettler's cell. The Superintendent saw\nhim enter, heard a loud exclamation, and hurried to his side. One\nglance told him that the prisoner had made good his boast.\n\nVon Kettler's cell was empty!\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_Conference_\n\nCaptain Richard Rennell, of the U. S. Air Service, but temporarily\ndetached to Intelligence, thought that Fredegonde Valmy had never\nlooked so lovely as when he helped her out of the cockpit.\n\nHer dark hair fell in disorder over her flushed cheeks, and her eyes\nwere sparkling with pleasure.\n\n\"A thousand thanks, M'sieur Rennell,\" she said, in her low voice with\nits slight foreign intonation. \"Never have I enjoyed a ride more than\nto-day. And I shall see you at Mrs. Wansleigh's ball to-night?\"\n\n\"I hope so--if I'm not wanted at Headquarters,\" answered Dick, looking\nat the girl in undisguised admiration.\n\n\"Ah, that Headquarters of yours! It claims so much of your time!\" she\npouted. \"But these are times when the Intelligence Service demands\nmuch of its men, is it not so?\"\n\n\"Who told you I was attached to Intelligence?\" demanded Dick bluntly.\n\nShe laughed mockingly. \"Do you think that is not known all over\nWashington?\" she asked. \"It is strange that Intelligence should act\nlike the--the ostrich, who buries his head in the sand and thinks that\nno one sees him because it is hidden.\"\n\nDick looked at the girl in perplexity. During the past month he had\ncompletely lost his head and heart over her, and he was trying to view\nher with the dispassionate judgment that his position demanded.\n\nAs the niece of the Slovakian Ambassador, Mademoiselle Valmy had the\nentry to Washington society. The Ambassador was away on leave, and she\nhad appeared during his absence, but she had been accepted\nunquestionably at the Embassy, where she had taken up her quarters,\nexplaining--as the Ambassador confirmed by cable--that she had sailed\nunder a misconception as to the date of his leave.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBrunette, beautiful, charming, she had a score of hearts to play with,\nand yet Dick flattered himself that he stood first. Perhaps the others\ndid too.\n\n\"Of course,\" the girl went on, \"with the Invisible Emperor threatening\norganized society, you gentlemen find yourselves extremely busy. Well,\nlet us hope that you locate him and bring him to book.\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" said Dick slowly, \"I almost think that you know something\nabout the Invisible Emperor.\"\n\nAgain she laughed merrily. \"Now, if you had said that my sympathies\nwere with the Invisible Emperor, I might have been surprised into an\nacknowledgment,\" she answered. \"After all, he does stand for that\naristocracy that has disappeared from the modern world, does he not?\nFor refinement of manners, for beauty of life, for all those things\nmen used to prize.\"\n\n\"Likewise for the existence of the vast body of the nation in\nignorance and poverty, in filth and squalor,\" answered Dick. \"No, my\nsympathies are with law and order and democracy, and your Invisible\nEmperor and his crowd are simply a gang of thieves and hold-up men.\"\n\n\"Be careful!\" A warning fire burned in the girl's eyes. \"At least, it\nis known that the Emperor's ears are long.\"\n\n\"So are a jackass's,\" retorted Dick.\n\nHe was sorry next moment, for the girl received his answer in icy\nsilence. In his car, which conveyed them from the tarmac to the\nEmbassy, she received all his overtures in the same silence. A frigid\nlittle bow was her farewell to him, while Dick, struggling between\nresentment and humiliation, sat dumb and wretched at the wheel.\n\nYet the idea that Fredegonde Valmy had any knowledge of the conspiracy\nor its leaders never entered Dick's head. He was only miserable that\nhe had offended her, and he would have done anything to have\nstraightened out the trouble.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed impossible that in the year 1940 the peace of the civilized\nworld could be threatened by an international conspiracy bent on\nrestoring absolutism, and yet each day showed more clearly the immense\nramifications of the plot. Each day, too, brought home to the\ninvestigating governments more clearly the fact that the things they\nhad discovered were few in number in comparison with those they had\nnot.\n\nThe headquarters of the conspirators had never been discovered, and it\nwas suspected that the powerful mind behind them was intentionally\nleading the investigators along false trails.\n\nThe conspiracy was world-wide. It had been behind the revolution that\nhad recreated an absolutist monarchy in Spain. It had plunged Italy\ninto civil war. It had thrown England into the convulsions of a\nsuccession of general strikes, using the communist movement as a cloak\nfor its activities.\n\nBut nobody dreamed that America could become a fertile field for its\ninsidious propaganda. Yet it was behind the millions of adherents of\nthe so-called Freemen's Party, clamoring for the destruction of the\nconstitution. Upon the anarchy that would follow the absolutist regime\nwas to be erected.\n\nAlready the mysterious powers had struck. Departments of State had\nbeen entered and important papers abstracted. The _Germania_ had\nmysteriously disappeared in mid-Atlantic, and a shipping panic had\nensued. There were tales of mysterious figures materializing out of\nnothingness. It was known that the conspirators were in possession of\ncertain chemical and electrical devices with which they hoped to\nachieve their ends.\n\nThe Superintendent of the penitentiary had had in his pocket an\nauthorization to stop the execution of Von Kettler after he stood on\nthe trap. Dead, he would be a mere mark of vengeance: alive, he might\nbe persuaded to furnish some clue to the headquarters of the\nmiscreants.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd behind the conspirators loomed the unknown figure that signed\nitself the Invisible Emperor--in the communications that poured in to\nthe White House and to the rulers of other nations. In the threats\nthat were materializing with stunning swiftness.\n\nWho was he? Rumor said that a former European ruler had not died as\nwas supposed: that a coffin weighted with lead had been buried, and\nthat he himself in his old age, had gone forth to a mad scheme of\nworld conquest with a body of his nobles.\n\nIt had been practically a state of war since the shipment of gold,\nguarded by a detachment of police, had been stolen in broad daylight\noutside Baltimore, the police clubbed and killed by invisible\nassailants--as they claimed. The press was under censorship, troops\nunder arms, and it was reported that the fleet was mobilizing.\n\nIn the midst of it all, Washington shopped, danced, feasted, flirted,\nlike a swarm of may flies over a treacherous stream.\n\nIntelligence was alert. As Dick started to drive away from the\nSlovakian Embassy, a man stepped quickly to the side of the car and\nthrust an envelope into his hand. Dick opened it quickly. He was\nwanted by Colonel Stopford at once, not at the camouflaged\nHeadquarters at the War Department, but at the real Headquarters where\nno papers were kept but weighty decisions were made. And to that\ndevious course the Government had already been driven.\n\nDick parked his car in a side street--it would have been under\nespionage in any of the official parking places--and set off at a\nsmart walk toward his destination. Nobody would have guessed, from the\nappearance of the streets, that a national calamity was impending. The\nshopping crowds were swarming along the sidewalks, cars tailed each\nother through the streets; only a detachment of soldiers on the White\nHouse lawn lent a touch of the martial to the scene.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe building which Dick entered was an ordinary ten-story one in the\nbusiness section; the various legal firms and commercial concerns that\noccupied it would have been greatly surprised to have known the\nidentity of the Ira T. Graves, Importer, whose name appeared in modest\nletters upon the opaque glass door on the seventh story. Inside a\nflapper stenographer--actually one of the most trusted members of\nIntelligence's staff--asked Dick's name, which she knew perfectly\nwell. Not a smile or a flicker of an eyelid betrayed the fact.\n\n\"Mr. Rennell,\" said Dick with equal gravity.\n\nThe girl passed into an inner room, and a buzzer sounded. In a few\nmoments the girl came back.\n\n\"Mr. Graves will be here in a few minutes, Mr. Rennell, if you'll\nkindly wait in his office,\" she said.\n\nDick thanked her, and walked through into the empty office. He waited\nthere till the girl had closed the door behind him, then went out by\nanother door and found himself again in the corridor. Opposite him was\na door with the words \"Entrance 769\" and a hand pointing down the\ncorridor to where the Intelligence service had established another\nperfectly innocent front. Dick tapped lightly at this door, and a key\nturned in the lock.\n\nThe man who stepped quickly back was one of the heads of the Civil\nService. The man at the flat-topped desk was Colonel Stopford. The man\non a chair beside him was one of the heads of the police force.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Colonel, a big, elderly man, dressed in a grey sack suit, checked\nDick's commencing salutation. \"Never mind etiquette, Rennell,\" he\nsaid. \"Sit down. You've heard about the man Von Kettler's escape last\nnight, of course?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"It's known, then. We can't keep things dark. He vanished from his\ncell in the death house, three minutes before the time appointed for\nhis execution, though, as a matter of fact, he wasn't going to be\nhanged. Apparently he walked through the walls.\n\n\"There's a sequel to it, Rennell. It seems he had told the\nassistant-superintendent, a man named Anstruther, that he'd meet him\nat a restaurant in town that night. He promised to leave him a\nmemento. Anstruther happened to remember this boast of Von Kettler's,\nand he surrounded the restaurant with armed detectives, on the chance\nthat the fellow would show up. Rennell, _Von Kettler was there!_\"\n\n\"He went to this restaurant, sir?\"\n\n\"He walked in, just before the place was surrounded, engaged a table,\nand ordered a sumptuous meal. He told the waiter his name, said he\nexpected a friend to join him, walked into the wash-room--and\nvanished! Two minutes later Anstruther and his men were on the job.\nVon Kettler never came out of the wash-room, so far as anybody knows.\n\n\"In the midst of the hue and cry somebody pointed to the table that\nVon Kettler had engaged. There was a twenty-dollar bill upon it, and a\nscrap of paper reading: 'I've kept my word. Von K.'\"\n\nColonel Stopford looked at Dick fixedly. \"Rennell, we may be fools,\"\nhe said, \"but we realize what we're up against. It's a big thing, and\nwe're going to need all our fighting grit to overcome it. You're one\nof the four men we're depending on. We're counting on you because of\nyour record, and because of your degree in science at Heidelberg. The\nPresident wishes you to take charge of the whole Eastern Intelligence\nDistrict, covering the entire south-eastern seaboard of the United\nStates. You are to have complete freedom of action, and all civil,\nmilitary, and naval officials have received instructions to co-operate\nwith you.\"\n\n\"There goes Mrs. Wansleigh's ball,\" thought Dick, but he said nothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We're not the hunters, Dick Rennell,\" went on Colonel Stopford.\n\"We're hiding under cover, and I'm counting on you to turn the tables.\nThey even know my office is here. I had a long distance call from\nSavannah this morning in mocking vein. They advised me to have the\nWhite House watched to-night. I warned the President, and we've posted\nguards all round it.\"\n\n\"They held the wire while you called up the President?\" asked Dick.\n\n\"Damn it, no! They called me up from Scranton the instant he'd\nfinished speaking. They have the power of the devil, Rennell, with\nthat infernal invisibility invention of theirs. Rennell, we're\nfighting unknown forces. Who this Invisible Emperor is, we don't even\nknow. But one thing we've found out. He has his headquarters somewhere\nin your district. Somewhere along the south Atlantic seaboard. The\ngreater part of his activities emanate from there. But we're fighting\nin the dark. The clue, the master clue that will enable us to locate\nhim--that's what we lack.\"\n\nThe sun had set, it was beginning to grow dark. Colonel Stopford\nswitched on the electric lamp beside his desk.\n\n\"What have you to say, Rennell?\" he asked; and Dick was aware that the\ntwo other men were regarding him attentively.\n\n\"It's evident,\" said Dick, \"that Von Kettler possessed this means of\ninvisibility in his cell, and wasn't detected. He simply slipped out\nwhen the guard came to fetch him.\"\n\n\"Invisibility? Yes! But invisible's not the same thing as\ntransparent,\" cried Stopford. \"These folks have operated in broad\ndaylight. They're transparent, damn them! Not even a shadow! You know\nwhat I mean, Rennell! What I'm thinking of! That crazy man you were in\ntouch with six months ago, who prophesied this! We turned him down! He\nshowed me a watch and said the salvation of the world was inside the\ncase! I thought him insane!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You mean Luke Evans, sir. That watch was his pocket model. He went\noff in a huff, saying the time would come when we'd want him and not\nbe able to find him.\"\n\n\"But, damn him, he wanted to produce universal darkness, or some such\nnonsense, Rennell, and I told him that we wanted light, not darkness.\"\n\n\"It wasn't exactly that, sir.\" Colonel Stopford was a man of the old\nschool: he had been an artillery officer in the Great War, and was\ncharacteristically impatient of new notions. Dick began carefully:\n\"You'll remember, sir, old Evans claimed to have been the inventor of\nthat shadow-breaking device that was stolen from him and sold in\nEngland.\"\n\n\"To a moving picture company!\" snorted Stopford. \"I asked him what\nmoving pictures had to do with war.\"\n\n\"Evans was convinced that the invention would be applied to war. He\nclaimed that it made the modern methods of military camouflage out of\ndate completely. He said that by destroying shadows one could produce\ninvisibility, since visibility consists in the refraction of wave\nlengths by material objects.\n\n\"When they stole his invention, he foresaw that it would be used in\nwar. He set to work to nullify his own invention. He told me that he\nhad unintentionally given to the enemies of the United States a means\nof bringing us to our knees, since he believed that British motion\npicture company was actually a subsidiary of Krupp's. He worked out a\nmethod of counteracting it.\"\n\n\"You must get him, Rennell. Even if it's all nonsense, we can't afford\nto let any chance go. If Evans's invention will counteract this damned\ninvisibility business--\"\n\nThe telephone on the Colonel's desk rang. He picked it up, and his\nface assumed an expression of incredulity. He looked about him, like a\nman bewildered. He beckoned to the police official, who hurried to his\nside, and thrust the receiver into his hand. The official listened.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. He turned to Dick and the Civil Service\nrepresentative.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"the President has disappeared from his office\nin the White House, and there are grave fears that he has been\nkidnapped!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_In the White House_\n\nColonel Stopford's car had been parked around the corner of the\nbuilding, and within a minute the four men were inside it, Stopford at\nthe wheel, and racing in the direction of the White House. A nod to\nthe guard at the gate, and they were inside the grounds. At the\nentrance a single guard, in place of the four who should have been\nposted there, challenged sharply, and attempted to bar the way, not\nrecognizing Dick or Stopford in their civilian clothes.\n\n\"Where's your officer?\" demanded Stopford sharply.\n\nHalf-cowed by the Colonel's manner, the young recruit hesitated, and\nthe four swept him out of the way and hurried on. The scene outside\nthe main entrance to the White House was one of indescribable\nconfusion. Soldiers were swarming in confused groups, some trying to\nforce an entrance, others pouring out. Every moment civilians,\nstreaming over the lawn, added to the number. Discipline seemed almost\nabandoned. From inside the building came outbursts of screams and\ncursing, the scuffling of a mob.\n\n\"Roscoe! Roscoe!\" shouted Stopford. \"Where's the President's\nsecretary? Who's seen him? Let us pass immediately!\"\n\nNo one paid the least attention to him. But a short, bare-headed\ncivilian, who was struggling in the crowd, heard, and shouted in\nanswer, waved his arms, and began to force his way toward the four. It\nwas Roscoe, the secretary of President Hargreaves. The President was a\nchildless widower, and Roscoe lived in the White House with him and\nwas intimately in his confidence.\n\nRoscoe gained Stopford's side. \"Say--they've got him!\" he panted.\n\"They've got him somewhere--inside the building. They're trying to get\nhim out! We've got to save him--but we can't see them--or him. They've\nmade him invisible too, curse them! I heard him crying, 'Help me,\nRoscoe!' He saw me, I tell you--and I didn't know where he was!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe little secretary was almost incoherent with fear and anger. The\nfive men, forming a wedge, hurled themselves forward. Out of the White\nHouse entrance appeared a tall officer, revolver in hand. It was\nColonel Simpson, of the President's staff. Half beside himself, he\nswept the weapon menacingly about him, shouting incoherently, and\nclearing a passage, into which the five hurled themselves.\n\nStopford seized his revolver hand, and after a brief struggle Simpson\nrecognized him.\n\n\"He's in the building!\" he shouted wildly. \"Somewhere upstairs! I'm\ntrying to form a cordon, but this damned mob's in the way. Kick those\ncivilians out!\" he cried to the soldiers. \"Shoot them if they don't\ngo! Guard the windows!\"\n\nStopford and Dick, at the head of the wedge, pushed past into the\nWhite House. The interior was packed, men were struggling frantically\non the staircase; it seemed hopeless to try to do anything.\n\nSuddenly renewed yells sounded from above, a scream of anguish, howls\nof terror. There came a downward surge, then a forward and upward one,\nwhich carried the two men up the stairs and into the President's\nprivate apartments above.\n\nIn the large reception-room a mob was struggling at a window, beneath\na blaze of electric light. A soldier was standing there like a statue,\nhis face fixed with a leer of horror. In his hands was a rifle, with a\nblood-stained bayonet, dripping upon the hardwood floor at the edge of\nthe rug. Upon the rug itself a stream of blood was spouting out of the\nair.\n\nDick looked at the sight and choked. There was something appalling in\nthe sight: it was the quintessence of horror, that widening pool of\nblood, staining the rug, and flowing from an invisible body that\nwrithed and twisted, while moans of anguish came from unseen lips.\n\nColonel Stopford leaped back, livid and staring. \"God, it's got\neyes--two eyes!\" he shouted.\n\nDick saw them too. The eyes, which alone were visible, were about six\ninches from the floor, and they were appearing and disappearing, as\nthey opened and shut alternately. It was a man lying there, a dying\nman, pierced by the soldier's bayonet by pure accident, dying and yet\ninvisible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe mob had scattered with shrieks of terror, but a few bolder spirits\nremained in a thin circle about that fearful thing on the rug. Dick\nbent over the man, and felt the outlines of the writhing body. It was\na man, apparently dressed in some sort of uniform, but this was\ncovered, from the top of the head to the feet, with a sort of sheer\nsilken garment, bifurcating below the waist, and resembling a cocoon.\nIt seemed to appear and alternately to vanish.\n\nDick seized the filmy stuff in his fingers, rent it, and stripped it\naway. Yells of terror and amazement broke from the throats of all.\nInstantly the thin circle of spectators had become reinforced by a\nstruggling mass of men.\n\nThe half-visible cocoon clung to Dick's body like spider webs. But the\nman who had been wearing it had sprung instantly into view beneath the\ncluster of electric lights. He was a fair-haired young fellow of about\nthirty years, his features white and set in the agony of death.\n\nHe was dressed in a trim uniform of black, with silver braid, and on\nhis shoulders were the insignia of a lieutenant. He opened his eyes,\nblue as the skies, and stared about him. He seemed to understand what\nhad happened to him.\n\n\"Dogs!\" he muttered.\n\nShrieks of fury answered him. The mob surged toward him as if to grind\nhis face to pieces under their feet--and then recoiled, mouthing and\ngibbering. But it was at Dick that they were looking, not at the dying\nman.\n\nHe raised himself upon one elbow with a mighty effort. \"His Majesty\nthe Invisible Emperor! Long be his reign triumphant!\" he chanted. It\nwas his last credo. The words broke from his lips accompanied by a\ntorrent of red foam. His head dropped back, his body slipped down; he\nwas gone. And no one seemed to observe his passing. They were all\nscreaming and gibbering at Dick.\n\n\"Rennell! Rennell!\" yelled Stopford. \"Where are you, Rennell? God,\nman, what's happened to your legs?\"\n\nDick looked down at himself. For a moment he had the illusion that he\nwas a head and a trunk, floating in the air. His lower limbs had\nbecome invisible, except for patches of trousering that seemed to\ndrift through space. The mob in the room had fallen back gaping at him\nin horror.\n\nThen Dick understood. It was the invisible garment that had coiled\nitself about him. He tore it from him and became visibly a man once\nmore.\n\nShouts from another room! A surging movement of the crowd toward it.\nThe muffled sounds of an automatic pistol, fitted with a silencer!\nThen screams:\n\n\"The devils are in there! They're murdering the soldiers!\"\n\nThere followed a panic-stricken rush, more muffled firing, and then\nthe sharp roar of rifles, and the fall of plaster. Some one was\nbawling the President's name. The rooms became a mass of milling human\nbeings, lost to all self-control.\n\nA bedlam of noise and struggle. Men fought with one another blindly,\ncursing soldiers fired promiscuously among the mob, riddling the\nwalls, stabbing at the air. The plaster was falling in great chunks\neverywhere, filling the rooms with a heavy white cloud, in which all\nchoked and struggled. The yells of the civilian mob below, struggling\nhelplessly in the packed crowd that wedged the great stairway, made\nbabel. Outside the White House a dense mob that filled the lawns was\nyelling back, and struggling to gain admittance. Suddenly the lights\nwent out.\n\n\"They've cut the wires!\" rose a wild, wailing voice. \"The devils have\ncut the wires! Kill them! Kill everybody!\"\n\nHis cry ended in a gurgle. Somewhere in that dark hell a struggle was\ngoing on, a well defined struggle, different from the random, aimless\nbattling of the half-crazed soldiers and the civilians. President\nHargreaves was still within the walls of the White House, it was\nknown; it was physically impossible for him to have been carried away\nwhen every foot of space was packed. And through that darkness the\ninvisible assailants were edging him, foot by foot, toward the\noutside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDick was on the edge of this silent battle. He sensed it. Bracing\nhimself against a bureau, while the mob surged past him, he tried to\npierce the gloom, to reinforce with his perceptions what his instinct\ntold him. A soldier, crazed with fear, came leaping at him, bayonet\nleveled. He thrust with a grunt. Dick avoided the glancing steel by a\nhand's breadth, and, as the impetus of the man's attack carried him\nforward, caught him beneath the chin with a stiff right-hand jolt that\nsent him sprawling.\n\nFrom below the cries broke out again, with renewed violence: \"They've\ngot the President! Get them! Get them! Close all doors and windows!\"\n\nBut a door went crashing down somewhere, to the tune of savage yells.\nThe mob was pouring down the stairs. It was growing less packed above.\nDick heard Stopford's voice calling his name.\n\n\"Here, sir\" he shouted back, and the two men collided.\n\n\"For God's sake do what you can, Rennell!\" shouted the Colonel.\n\"They've got the President downstairs. They had him in this very room,\nin the thick of it all. I heard him cry out, as if under a gag. They\nput one of those damned cloths over him. God, Rennell, I'm going\ncrazy!\"\n\nThe upper floor of the White House was almost empty now. Dick thrust\nhimself into the crowd that still jammed the stairs. He reached the\nground floor. It was lighter here, but a glance showed him that it was\nimpossible to attempt to restore any semblance of order. The big East\nRoom was jammed with a fighting, cursing throng. Dick stumbled over\nthe bodies of those who had fallen in the press, or had been shot\ndown. Outside the mob was thickening, swarming through the grounds and\nscreeching like madmen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNothing that could be done! Dick found himself caught once more in the\nhuman torrent. Presently he was wedged up against a broken window. He\nprecipitated himself through the frame, dropped to the ground, stopped\nfor an instant to catch breath.\n\nThe yelling mob was congregated about the main entrance of the White\nHouse, and on this side the grounds were comparatively empty. As Dick\nstopped, trying desperately to form some plan of action, he heard\nfootsteps and low voices near him. Then two men came toward him,\nfollowed by three or four others.\n\nThe men--but, though the light was faint, Dick realized instantly that\nthey were wearing invisible garments. He could see nothing of them; he\ncould see through where they seemed to be--the trees, the buildings of\nthe streets. Yet they were at his elbow. And they saw him. He heard\none of them leap, and sprang aside as the butt of a pistol descended\nthrough the air and dropped where his head had been.\n\nYet no hand had seemed to hold it. It had been a pistol, reversed, and\nflashing downward, to be arrested in mid-air six inches from his face.\nBut the men were not wholly invisible. Nearly six feet above the\nground, three or four pairs of eyes were staring malevolently into\nDick's. Only the eyes were there.\n\nThe two foremost men were breathing heavily. They were carrying\nsomething. Grotesquely through a rent in the invisible garment Dick\nsaw a patch of trouser. He heard a muffled sigh. President Hargreaves,\nin the hands of his abductors!\n\nDick's actions were reflex. As the pistol hung beside his face, he\nsnatched at it, wrested it away, struck with it, and heard a curse and\nfelt the yielding impact of bone and flesh. He had missed the head but\nstruck the shoulder. Next moment hands gripped the weapon, and a\ndesperate struggle began.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was torn from Dick's grasp. He struck out at random, and his fist\ncollided with the chin of a substantial flesh and blood human being.\nInvisible arms grasped him. He fought free. The pistol slashed his\nface sidewise, the sight ripping a strip of flesh from the cheek. He\nwas surrounded, he was being beaten down, though he was fighting\ngamely.\n\n\"Kill the swine! Shoot! Shoot!\" Dick heard one of his assailants\nmuttering.\n\nOut of the void appeared the blue muzzle of another automatic, with a\nsilencer on it. Dick ducked as a flame spurted from it. He felt the\nbullet stir his hair. He grasped at the hand that held it, and missed.\nThen he was held fast, and the muzzle swung implacably toward his head\nagain. Helpless, he watched it describe that arc of death. It was only\nlater that he wondered why he had fought all the while in silence,\ninstead of crying for help.\n\nBut of a sudden the pistol was dashed aside. A woman's voice spoke\nperemptorily, in some language Dick did not understand. And he saw her\neyes among the eyes that glared at him. Dark eyes that he knew, even\nif the voice had not revealed her identity. The eyes and voice of\nFredegonde Valmy!\n\nDick cried her name. He put forth all his strength in a final\nstruggle. Suddenly he felt a stunning impact on the back of the head.\nHe slipped, reeled, threw out his hands, and sank down unconscious on\nthe grass at the side of the path.\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_The Invisible Ambassador_\n\nFredegonde Valmy implicated in the conspiracy! That was the first\nthought that flashed into Dick's mind as he recovered consciousness.\nHe might have suspected it! But the idea that the girl he loved was\nbound up with the murderous gang that was attacking the very\nfoundations of civilization chilled him to the soul.\n\nDick had been picked up a few minutes after he had been struck down,\nidentified by Colonel Stopford as he was about to be removed to a\nhospital, and carried into the White House. Order had been restored by\nthe arrival of a detachment of troops from Fort Myers, the severed\ncables located and mended, and by midnight the interior of the\nPresidential home had been made habitable again.\n\nPresident Hargreaves was gone--kidnapped despite the utmost efforts to\nprotect him; and it was impossible to conceal that fact from the\nworld. But the wheels of government still revolved. All night an\nemergency council sat in the White House, and, deciding that in a time\nof such grave danger heroic means must be adopted, with the consent of\nsuch of the Congressional leaders as could be summoned, a Council of\nDefence was organized.\n\nThe whole country east of the Mississippi was placed under martial\nlaw. The fleet and army were put on a war footing. Flights of\nairplanes were assembled at numerous points along the eastern\nseaboard. To this Council Donald was attached as head of Intelligence\nfor the Eastern Division. Yet all this availed little unless the\nlocation of the Invisible Empire could be ascertained, and, despite\ntelegraphic reports that came in hourly, alleging to have discovered\nits headquarters, nothing had been achieved in this direction.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe garment taken from the slain soldier had been examined by a\nhalf-dozen of the leading chemists of the East. Pending the arrival\nfrom New York of the celebrated Professor Hosmeyer, it was deposited\nunder military guard in a dark closet. The result was unfortunate. The\ngarment exhibited to the assembled scientists was a mere bifurcated\nsilken bag.\n\nThe gas with which it had been impregnated, though it had been heavy\nenough to adhere to the fabric for hours, had also been volatile\nenough to have disappeared completely, leaving a residue which was\nidentified as a magnesium isotope.\n\nEqually spectacular had been the disappearance of Mademoiselle\nFredegonde Valmy. A cable from the Slovakian Ambassador had arrived a\nfew hours later, denying her authenticity. And with her disappearance\ncame the discovery that she had been at the head of an espionage\nsystem with ramifications in every state department, and in every\nstatesman's home.\n\nThree days passed with no sign from the enemy. The Council sat all\nday. In the executive offices of the White House Dick toiled\nceaselessly, planning, receiving reports, organizing the flights of\nairplanes at strategic points throughout his district. From time to\ntime he would be summoned to the Council. At night he threw himself\nupon a cot in his office and slept a sleep broken by the constant\narrival of messengers. And still there was no clue to the location of\nthe headquarters of the marauders.\n\nBut in those three days there had been no sign of them. Hope had\nsucceeded despair; in the rebound of confidence the populace was\nbeginning to ridicule the nation-wide precautions against what were\ncoming to be considered merely a gang of super-criminals. It was even\nwhispered that President Hargreaves had not been kidnapped at all. The\nFreemen's Party accused the Government of a plot to subvert popular\nliberties.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDick received a summons on the third evening. Utterly worn out with\nhis work, he pulled himself together and made his way into the Blue\nRoom, where the Council was assembled. Vice-president Tomlinson, an\nelderly man, was in the chair. A non-entity, pushed into a post it had\nbeen thought he would adorn innocuously, he had been overwhelmed by\nhis succession to the chief office of State.\n\nTomlinson did not like Dick, or any of the hustling younger officers\nwho, unlike himself, realized the real significance of the danger that\noverhung the country. He sat pompously in his leather chair, regarding\nDick as he entered in obedience to the summons.\n\n\"Well, Captain Rennell, what have you to report to us this evening?\"\nhe inquired, as Dick saluted and stood to attention at the table.\n\n\"We're improving our concentrations, Mr. Vice-president. We've eight\nflights of seaplanes scouring the coast in the hope of locating the\nstronghold of the Invisible Emperor. We've--\"\n\n\"I'm sick and tired of that title,\" shouted Tomlinson. He sprang to\nhis feet, his face flushed with anger. His nerves had broken under the\ncontinuous strain. \"I'll give you my opinion, Captain Rennell,\" he\nsaid. \"And that is that this so-called Invisible Emperor is a myth.\n\n\"A gang of thieves has invented a paint that renders them\ninconspicuous, has created a panic, and is taking advantage of it to\nterrorize the country. The whole business is poppycock, in my opinion,\nand the sooner this bubble bursts the better. Well, sir, what have you\nto say to that?\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen any of these men in their invisible clothing, if I\nmay ask, Mr. Vice-president?\" inquired Dick, trying to keep down his\nanger. His nerves, too, were badly frazzled.\n\n\"No, sir, I have not, but my opinion is that this story is grossly\nexaggerated, and that the persons responsible are the reporters of our\nsensational press!\" thundered Tomlinson.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked about him, a weak man proud of having asserted his\nauthority. Somebody laughed.\n\nTomlinson glared at Dick, his rubicund visage purpling. But it was not\nDick who had laughed. Nor any one at the council table.\n\nThat laugh had come from the wall beside the door. Again it broke\nforth, high-pitched, cold, derisive. All heads turned as if upon\npivots to see who had uttered it.\n\n\"Good God!\" exclaimed Secretary Norris, of the War Department, and\nslumped in his chair.\n\nFive feet eight inches from the floor a pair of grey eyes looked at\nthe Council members out of emptiness. Grey eyes, a man's eyes, cool,\ncontemptuous, and filled with authority, with a contemptuous sense of\nsuperiority that left every man there dumb.\n\nDick was the first to recover himself. He stepped forward, not to\nwhere the invisible man was standing, but to a point between him and\nthe door.\n\nThat cold laugh broke forth again. \"Gentlemen, I am an ambassador from\nmy sovereign, who chooses to be known as the Invisible Emperor,\" came\nthe words. \"As such, I claim immunity. Not that I greatly care, should\nyou wish to violate the laws of nations and put me to death. But,\nbelieve me, in such case the retribution will be a terrible one.\"\n\nSuddenly the envoy peeled off the gas-impregnated garments that\ncovered him. He stood before the Council, a fair-haired young man,\nclad in the same fashion of trim black uniform as the bayonetted\nsoldier had worn upstairs three nights before.\n\nHe bowed disdainfully, and it was Tomlinson who shouted:\n\n\"Arrest that man! I know his face! I've seen it in the papers. He's\nVon Kettler, the murderer who escaped from jail in an invisible suit.\"\n\n\"Oh, come, Mr. Vice-president,\" laughed Von Kettler, \"are you sure\nthis isn't all very much exaggerated?\"\n\nTomlinson sank back in his chair, his ruddy face covered with sweat.\nDick stared at Von Kettler. A suspicion was forming in his mind. He\nhad seen eyes like those before, dark instead of grey, and yet with\nthe same look of pride and breeding in them; the look of the face,\ntoo, impossible to mistake--he knew!\n\nFredegonde Valmy was Von Kettler's sister!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, am I to receive the courtesies of an ambassador?\"\ninquired Van Kettler, advancing.\n\n\"You shall have the privileges of the gallows rope!\" shouted\nTomlinson. \"Arrest that man at once, Captain Rennell!\"\n\n\"Pardon me, Mr. Vice-president,\" suggested the Secretary for the Navy\nblandly, \"but perhaps it would be more desirable to hear what he has\nto say.\"\n\n\"Immunity for thieves, robbers, murderers!\"\n\n\"Might I suggest,\" said Von Kettler suavely, \"that, since the United\nStates has honored my master by placing itself upon a war footing, it\nhas accorded him the rights of a belligerent?\"\n\n\"We'll hear you, Mr. Von Kettler,\" said the Secretary of State,\nglancing along the table. Three or four nodded, two shook their heads:\nTomlinson only glared speechlessly at the intruder. Von Kettler\nadvanced to the table and laid a paper upon it.\n\n\"You recognize that signature, gentlemen?\" he asked.\n\nAt the bottom of the paper Dick saw scrawled the bold and unmistakable\nsignature of President Hargreaves.\n\n\"An order signed by the President of your country,\" purred Von\nKettler, \"ordering your military forces replaced upon a peace footing,\nand the acceptance of our conditions. They are not onerous, and will\nnot interfere with the daily life of the country. Merely a little\nchange in that outworn document, the Constitution. My master rules\nAmerica henceforward.\"\n\nSomebody laughed: another laughed: but it was the Secretary of State\nwho did the fine thing. He took up the paper bearing what purported to\nbe President Hargreaves's signature, and tore it in two.\n\n\"The people of this country are her rulers,\" he said, \"not an old man\ndragooned into signing a proclamation while in captivity--if indeed\nthat is President Hargreaves's signature.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere came a sudden burst of applause. Von Kettler's face became the\nmask of a savage beast. He shook his fist furiously.\n\n\"You call my master a forger?\" he shouted. \"You yourselves repudiate\nyour own Constitution, which places the control of army and navy in\nthe hands of your President? You refuse to honor his signature?\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Mr. Von Kettler!\" The voice of the Secretary of State\ncut like a steel edge. \"You totally mistake the temper of the people\nof this country. We don't surrender, even to worthy adversaries, much\nless to a gang of common thieves, murderers, and criminals like\nyourselves. You have been accorded the privilege you sought, that of\nan envoy, and that was straining the point. Show yourself here again\nafter two minutes have elapsed, and you'll go to the gallows--for\nkeeps.\"\n\n\"Dogs!\" shouted Von Kettler, beside himself with fury. \"Your doom is\nupon you even at this moment. I have but to wave my arm, and\nWashington shall be destroyed, and with her a score of other cities. I\ntell you you are at our mercy. Thousands of lives shall pay for this\ninsult to my master. I warn you, such a catastrophe is coming as shall\nshow you the Invisible Emperor does not threaten in vain!\"\n\nWith complete nonchalance the Secretary of State took out his watch.\n\"One minute and fifteen seconds remaining. Captain Rennell,\" he said.\n\"At the expiration of that time, put Mr. Von Kettler under arrest. I\nadvise you to go back to your master quickly, Mr. Von Kettler,\" he\nadded, \"and tell him that we'll have no dealings with him, now or\never.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment longer Von Kettler stood glaring; then, with a laugh of\nderision and a gesture of the hands he vanished from view. And, though\nthey might have expected that denouement, the members of the Council\nleaped to their feet, staring incredulously at the place where he had\nbeen. Nothing of Von Kettler was visible, not even the eyes, and there\nsounded not the slightest footfall.\n\nDick sprang forward to the door, but his outstretched arms encountered\nonly emptiness. In spite of the Secretary of State's instructions, he\nwas almost minded to apprehend the man. If he could get him!\n\nThe corridor was empty. A guard of soldiers was at the entrance, but\nthey did not block the entrance. Even now Von Kettler might be passing\nthem! Why didn't his feet sound upon the floor? How could a bulky man\nglide so smoothly?\n\nPerhaps because Dick was undecided what to do, Von Kettler escaped\nhim. By the time he reached the guards he knew he had escaped.\nSuddenly there came an unexpected denouement. Somewhere on the White\nHouse lawn a guard challenged, fired. The snap of one of the silenced\nautomatics answered him.\n\nWhen Dick and the guards reached the spot, the man was lying in a\ncrumpled heap.\n\n\"An airplane,\" he gasped. \"Invisible airplane. I--bumped into it.\nMen--in it. The damned dogs!\"\n\nHe died. Dick stared around him. There was no sign of any airplane on\nthe lawn, nothing but the tents of the guards, white in the moonlight,\nand the grim array of anti-aircraft guns that Dick had placed there.\n\nBut behind the White House, in hastily constructed hangars, were a\nhalf-dozen of the latest pursuit airships--beautiful slim hulls,\nheavily armored, with armored turrets containing each a quick-firer\nwith the new armor-piercing bullets. One of these ships, Dick's own,\nwas kept perpetually warmed and ready to take the air.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDick raced across the lawn, yelled to the startled guard in charge.\nThe mechanics came running from their quarters. Almost by the time\nDick reached it the ship was ready.\n\nHe twirled the helicopter starter, and she roared and zoomed, taking\nan angle of a hundred and twenty-five degrees upward off a runway of\ntwenty yards. Into the air she soared, into the moonlight, up like an\narrow for five hundred feet.\n\nDick pulled the soaring lever, and she hung there, buzzing like a bee\nas her helicopters, counteracting the pull of gravity, held her\ncomparatively stable. He scanned the air all about him.\n\nWashington lay below, her myriad lights gleaming. Immediately beneath\nhim Dick saw the guns and the tents of the soldiers, and the little\ngroup that was removing the body of the murdered soldier on a\nstretcher. But there were no signs of any hostile craft.\n\nHad the murdered man really bumped into an invisible airship, or had\nhe only thought he had? Had those devils learned to apply the gas to\nthe surfaces of airplanes? There was no reason why they should not\nhave done so.\n\nBut surely the utmost ingenuity of man had not contrived to render a\nmodern plane, with its metalwork and machinery, absolutely\ntransparent?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd, again, how was it possible to have silenced the sound of engines,\nthe whir of a propeller, so that there should be no auditory\nindication whatever of a plane's presence?\n\nDick looked all about him. Nothing was in the air--he could have sworn\nit. He replaced the soaring lever and banked in a close circle, his\nglance piercing the night. No, there was nothing.\n\nCrash! Boom! The plane rocked violently, tossing upon gusts of air. A\nhuge, gaping hole of blackness had suddenly appeared in the middle of\nthe White House lawn. The tents were flat upon the ground. Through the\nrising smoke clouds Dick saw tongues of flame.\n\nNo shell that, but a bomb, and dropped from the skies less than five\nhundred feet from where Dick hovered. Yet there was nothing visible in\nthe skies save the round orb of the moon.\n\nA rush of wind past Dick's face! One of the vanes of the helicopter\ncrumpled and fluttered away into the night. Dick needed no further\npersuasion. The dead soldier had not lied.\n\nVon Kettler had begun the fulfillment of his threat!\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_The Enemy Strikes_\n\nAs Dick's airship veered and side-slipped, he kicked hard on the left\nrudder and brought the nose around. Furiously he sprayed the air with\na leaden hail from his quick-firer. He heard a rush of wind go past\nhim, and realized that his unseen antagonist had all but rammed him.\n\nYet nothing was visible at all, save the moon and the empty sky. He\nhad heard the rush of the prop-wash, but he had seen nothing, heard\nnothing else. Incredible as it seemed, the pilot was flying a plane\nthat had attained not merely invisibility but complete absence of all\nsound.\n\nDick side-slipped down, pancaked, and crashed. He emerged from a plane\nwrecked beyond hope of early repair, yet luckily with no injury beyond\na few minor bruises. He rushed toward the hangar, to encounter a bevy\nof scared mechanics.\n\n\"Another plane! Rev one up quick!\" he shouted.\n\nPlanes were already being wheeled out, pilots in flying suits and\ngoggles were striding beside them. Dick ordered one of them away,\nstepped into his plane, and in a moment was in the air again.\n\nIn the minute or two that had elapsed since the encounter, the enemy\nhad been active. Crash after crash was resounding from various parts\nof Washington. Buildings were rocking and toppling, d\u00e9bris strewed the\nstreets, fires were springing up everywhere. A thousand feet aloft,\nDick could see the holocaust of destruction that was being wrought by\nthe infernal missiles.\n\nBombs of such power had been the unattained ambition of every\ngovernment of the world--and it had been left to the men of the\nInvisible Emperor to attain to them. Whole streets went into ruin at\neach discharge and from everywhere within the city the wailing cry of\nthe injured went up, in a resonant moan of pain.\n\nIn the central part of the city, the district about F Street and the\ngovernment buildings, nothing was standing, except those buildings\nfashioned of structural steel, and these showed twisted girders like\nthe skeletons of primeval monsters, supporting sections of sagging\nfloors. Houses, hotels had melted into shapeless heaps of rubble,\nwhich filled the streets to a depth of a dozen yards, burying\neverything beneath them. Yet here and there could be seen the forms of\ndead pedestrians, motor-cars emerging out of the d\u00e9bris, lying in\nevery conceivable position; horses, horribly mangled, were shrieking\nas they tried to free themselves. And yet, despite this ruin, the\ngeneral impression upon Dick's mind, as he beat to and fro, signaling\nto his flight to spread, was that of a vast, empty desolation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFurther away: where the ruin had not yet fallen, thousands of human\nbeings were milling in a mass, those upon the fringes of the crowd\nperpetually breaking away, other swarms approaching them, so that the\nentire agglomeration resembled a seething whirlpool turning slowly\nupon itself.\n\nThen of a sudden the strains of the national anthem floated up to\nDick's ears. A band was playing in the White House grounds. The tune\nwas ragged, and the drum came in a fraction of a second late, but an\nimmense pride and elation filled Dick's soul.\n\n\"They'll never beat us!\" he thought, intensely, \"with such a spirit\nas that!\"\n\nHe had signaled his flight to spread, and search the air. He could see\nthe individual ships darting here and there over the immensity of the\ncity, but none knew better than he how fruitless their effort was. And\nthe marauders had not ceased their deadly work.\n\nA bomb dropped near the Washington Monument, sending up a huge spout\nof dust that veiled it from his eyes. Instinctively Dick shot toward\nthe scene. Slowly the dust subsided, and then a yell of exultation\nbroke from Dick's lips. The noble shaft still stood, a slim taper\npointing to the skies.\n\nIt was an omen of ultimate success, and Dick took heart. No, they'd\nnever beat the grim, unconquerable tenacity of the American people.\n\nYet the damage was proceeding at a frightful rate. A bomb dropped\nsquarely on the Corcoran Gallery and resolved it into a heap of silly\nstones. A bomb fell in the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue, and the\nhouses on either side collapsed like houses of cards, falling into a\nsulphurous, fiery pit. And still there was nothing visible but the sky\nand the moon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDick gritted his teeth and swore as he circled over the site of\ndestruction, out of which tiny figures were struggling. He heard the\nclang of the fire bells as the motor trucks came roaring toward the\nscene. Then crash! again. Five blocks northward another dense cloud of\ndust arose, and the new area of destruction, spreading as swiftly as\nripples over a pond, joined the former one, leaving a huge, irregular\nopen space, piled up with masonry and brick in a number of flat-topped\npyramids.\n\nInto this, houses went crashing every moment, with a sound like the\nclatter of falling crockery, but infinitely magnified.\n\n\"The devils! The swine!\" shouted Dick. \"And we gave Von Kettler the\nprivileges of an ambassador!\"\n\nAnd Fredegonde was the sister of this devil! The remembrance of that\nstruck a cold chill to Dick's heart again. He tried to blot out her\npicture from his mind, but he still saw her as she had appeared that\nday after the air ride, flushed, smiling, radiant in her dark beauty.\n\nA murderess and a spy! He cursed her as he banked and circled back. He\nwas helpless. He could do nothing. And all Washington would be\ndestroyed by morning, if the supply of bombs kept up. But there was\nmore to come. Suddenly Dick became aware that two of his flight, at\nwidely separated distances, were going down in flames. Flaming comets,\nthey dropped plump into the destruction below. Another caught fire and\nwas going down. No need to question what was happening.\n\nThe invisible enemy was attacking his flight and picking off his men\none by one!\n\nHe drove furiously toward two of his planes whose erratic movements\nshowed that they were being attacked. As he neared them he saw one\ncatch fire and begin its earthward swoop. Then the fuselage crackled\nbeside him, and his instrument board dissolved into ruin.\nInstinctively he went round in a tight bank and loosed his\nmachine-gun. Nothing there! Nothing at all! Yet his right wing went\nragged, and his own furious blasts into the sky, their echoes drowned\nby the roar of his propeller, were productive of nothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe shot past the uninjured plane, signalling it to descend. He wasn't\ngoing to let his men ride aloft to helpless butchery. Nothing could be\ndone until some means was discovered of counteracting the enemy's\nterrific advantage.\n\nHe darted across the heart of the city to where another of the flight\nwas circling, waggling his wings to indicate to it to descend. Then on\nto the next plane and the next, shepherding them. Thank God they\nunderstood! They were bunching toward the hangar. Yet another took\nfire and dropped, a burning wreck. Half his flight out of commission,\nand not an enemy visible!\n\nHe was aloft alone now, courting death--instant, invisible death. He\nwouldn't descend until that carnival of murder was at an end. But it\nwas not at an end. Another crash, far up Pennsylvania Avenue, showed\nan attempt upon the Capitol. Again--again, and a smoking hell wreathed\nthe noble buildings so that it was no longer possible to see them. A\nlull, and then a crash nearer the city's heart. Crash! Crash!\n\nInvisible though the enemy was, it was easy to trace the movements of\nthis particular plane by the successive areas of destruction that it\nleft behind it. It was coming back over Pennsylvania Avenue, dropping\nits bombs at intervals. It was methodically wiping out an entire\nsection of Washington.\n\nDick drove his plane toward it. There was one chance in a thousand\nthat, if he could accurately gauge the progress of his invisible\nantagonist, he could crash him and go down with him to death. If he\ncould get close enough to feel his prop-wash! A wild chance, but\nDick's mind was keyed up to desperation. He shot like an arrow toward\nthe scene, with a view to intercepting the murderer.\n\nThen of a sudden he became aware of a curious phenomenon. A black beam\nwas shooting across the sky. A black searchlight! It came from the\nflat top of a large hotel that had somehow escaped the universal\ndestruction, and, with its gaunt skeleton of structural steel showing\nin squares, towered out of the ruin all about it like an island.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was from here that the black beam started. It spread fanwise across\nthe sky. But it was not merely blackness. It was utter and\nimpenetrable darkness, cleaving the sky like a knife. Where it\npassed, the rays of the moon were extinguished as fire is extinguished\nby water.\n\nA beam of absolute blackness, that pierced the air like a widening\ncone, and made the night seem, by contrast, of dazzling brightness\nalong either dark border.\n\nHigh into the air that dark beam shot, moving to and fro in the sky.\nDick, darting toward the spot where he hoped to find his invisible\nenemy, found himself caught in it.\n\nIn utter, inextinguishable darkness! Like a trapped bird he fluttered,\nhurling himself this way and that till suddenly he found himself\nblinking in the dazzling light of the moon again, and the black beam\nwas overhead.\n\nCrash! Another widening sphere of ruin as the invisible marauder\ndropped a bomb. Dick cursed bitterly. Trapped in that black beam, he\nhad lost his direction. The invisible plane had shot past the point\nwhere he had hoped to intercept it.\n\nHe flung his soaring lever, and hung suspended in the air. An easy\nmark for the enemy, if he chose to take the opportunity. No matter.\nDeath was all that Dick craved. He had seen half his flight wiped out,\nand a hundred thousand human beings hurled to destruction. He wanted\nto die.\n\nThen suddenly a wild shout came to his ears, as if all Washington had\ngone mad with triumph. And Dick heard himself shouting too, before he\nknew it, almost before he knew why.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor overhead, where the inky finger searched the sky, a luminous shape\nappeared, a silvery cigar, riding in the void. The finger missed it,\nand again there was only the moonlight. It caught it again--and again\nthe whole devastated city rang with yells of derision, hate, and anger\nas the black beam held it.\n\nIt held it! To and fro that silvery cigar scurried in a frantic\nattempt to avoid detection, and remorselessly the black beam held it\ndown.\n\nIt held it down, and it outlined it as clearly as a figure on the\nmoving picture screen. Then suddenly there came a flash, followed by a\ndull detonation, and a black cloud appeared, spreading into a flower\nof death near the cigar, and at the edge of the black beam. The cheers\ngrew frantic. The anti-aircraft battery in the White House grounds had\ngrasped the situation, and was opening fire.\n\nTo and fro, like a trapped beast, the cigar-shaped airplane fled. Once\nit seemed to escape. It faded from the edge of the black finger--faded\ninto nothingness amid a roar of execretion. Then it was caught and\nheld.\n\nTruncated, bounded by an arc of sky, the black finger followed the\nmurderer in his flight remorselessly. And all around him the\nanti-aircraft guns were placing a barrage of death.\n\nHe was trapped. No need for Dick to rush in to battle. To do so might\ncall off that deadly barrage that held the murderer in a ring of\ndeath. Hovering, Dick watched. And then, perhaps panic-stricken,\nperhaps rendered desperate, perhaps through sheer, wanton courage that\nmight have commanded admiration under nobler circumstances, the\nairship turned and drove straight in the direction of the battery,\ndropping another bomb as she did so.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt fell in a crowded street, swarming with spectators who had\nclambered upon the fallen d\u00e9bris, and it wrought hideous destruction.\nBut this time there was hardly a cry--no unison of despair such as had\ncome to Dick's ears before. The suspense was too tense. All eyes\nwatched the airship as, seeming to bear a charmed life, she drove for\nthe White House itself, through a ring of shells that widened and\ncontracted alternately, with the object of placing a last bomb\nsquarely upon the building before going down in death. And all the\nwhile the black searchlight held it.\n\nDick Rennell was to experience many thrilling moments afterward, but\nthere was never a period, measurable by seconds, yet seeming to extend\nthrough all eternity--never a period quite so fraught with suspense\nas, hovering there, he watched the flight of that silvery plane\nspeeding straight toward the executive mansion while all around it the\nshells bloomed and spread. It was over the White House grounds. The\narchies had failed; they were being outmaneuvered, they could not be\nswung in time to follow the trajectory of the plane. Dick held his\nbreath.\n\nThen suddenly the silvery ship dissolved in a blaze of fire, a shower\nof golden sparks such as fly from a rocket, and simultaneously the\nlast bomb that she was to drop broke upon the ground below.\n\nDown she plunged, instantly invisible as she escaped the finger of the\nblack beam; but she dropped into the vortex of ruin that she herself\nhad created. Into a pit of blazing fire, criss-crossed by falling\ntrees, that had engulfed the battery and a score of men.\n\nThen suddenly Dick understood. He flung home the soaring lever,\nbanked, and headed, not for the White House, but for the flat roof of\nthe hotel from which the black searchlight was still projecting itself\nthrough the skies. He hovered above, and dropped, light as a feather,\nupon the rooftop.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was only one person there--an old man dressed in a shabby suit,\nkneeling before a great block of stone that had been dislodged upward\nfrom the parapet and formed a sort of table. Upon this table the old\nman had placed a large, square box, resembling an exaggerated kodak,\nand it was from the lens of this box that the black beam was\nprojecting.\n\nDick sprang from his cockpit as the old man rose in alarm. He ran to\nhim and caught him by the arm.\n\n\"Luke Evans!\" he cried. \"Thank God you've come back in time to save\nAmerica!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_The Gas_\n\nIn the Blue Room of the White House the Council listened to old Luke\nEvans's exposition of his invention with feelings ranging from\nincredulity to hope.\n\n\"I've been at work all the time,\" said the old man, \"not far from\nhere. I knew the day would come when you'd need me. I put my pride\naside for the sake of my country.\"\n\n\"Tell us in a few words about this discovery of yours, Mr. Evans,\"\nsaid Colonel Stopford.\n\nLuke Evans placed the square black case upon the table. \"It's simple,\nlike all big things, sir,\" he answered. \"The original shadow-breaking\ndevice that I invented was a heavy, inert gas, invisible, but almost\nas viscous as paint. Applied to textiles, to inorganic matter, to\nanimal bodies, it adheres for hours. Its property is to render such\nsubstances invisible by absorbing all the visible light rays that fall\nupon it, from red to violet. Light passes through all substances that\nare coated with this paint as if they did not exist.\"\n\n\"And this antidote of yours?\" asked Colonel Stopford.\n\n\"Darkness,\" replied Luke Evans. \"A beam of darkness that means\nabsolute invisibility. It can be shot from this apparatus\"--he\nindicated the box upon the table. \"This box contains a minute portion\nof a gas which exists in nature in the form of a black, crystalline\npowder. The peculiar property of this powder is that it is the\nsolidified form of a gas more volatile than any that is known. So\nvolatile is it that, when the ordinary atmospheric pressure of fifteen\npounds to the square inch is removed, the powder instantly changes to\nthe gaseous condition.\"\n\n\"By pressing this lever\"--Evans pointed at the box--\"a vacuum is\ncreated. Instantly the powder becomes a gas, which shoots forth\nthrough this aperture with the speed of a projectile, taking the form\nof a beam of absolute blackness. Or it can be discharged from\ncylinders in such a way as to extend over a large area within a few\nminutes.\"\n\n\"But how does this darkness make the invisible airships luminous?\"\nasked Stopford. \"Why does not your darkness destroy all light?\"\n\n\"In this way, sir,\" replied the old inventor. \"The shadow-breaking gas\nwith which the airships are painted confers invisibility because it\nabsorbs sunlight. But it does not absorb the still more rapid waves,\nor oscillations which manifest themselves as radio-activity. On the\ncontrary, it gathers and reflects these.\n\n\"Now Roentgen, the discoverer of the X-ray, observed that if X-rays\nare allowed to enter the eye of an observer who is in complete\ndarkness, the retina receives a stimulus, and light is perceived, due\nto the fluorescent action of the X-rays upon the eyeball.\n\n\"Consequently, by creating a beam of complete darkness, I bring into\nclear visibility the fluorescent gas that coats the airships; in other\nwords, the airships become visible.\"\n\n\"If a light ray is nullified upon entering the field of darkness, will\nit emerge at the other edge as a perfect light ray again?\" asked\nStopford.\n\n\"It will emerge unchanged, since the black beam destroys light by\nslightly slowing down the vibrations to a point where they are not\nperceived as light by the human eye. On emerging from the beam,\nhowever, these vibrations immediately resume their natural frequency.\nTo give you a homely parallel, the telephone changes sound waves to\nelectric waves, and re-converts them into sound waves at the other\nend, without any appreciable interruption.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Stopford, \"the logical application of your method is to\nplunge every city in the land into darkness by means of this gas?\"\n\n\"That is so, sir, and then we shall have the advantage of\ninvisibility, and the enemy ships will be in fluorescence.\"\n\n\"Damned impracticable!\" muttered Stopford.\n\n\"You seriously propose to darken the greater part of eastern North\nAmerica?\" asked the Secretary for War.\n\n\"The gas can be produced in large quantities from coal tar besides\nexisting in crystalline deposits,\" replied Luke Evans. \"It is so\nvolatile that I estimate that a single ton will darken all eastern\nNorth America for five days. Whereas the concentration would be made\nonly in specific areas liable to attack. The gas is distilled with\ngreat facility from one of the tri-phenyl-carbinol coal-tar\nderivatives.\"\n\nVice-president Tomlinson was a pompous, irascible old man, but it was\nhe who hit the nail on the head.\n\n\"That's all very well as an emergency measure, but we've got to find\nthe haunt of that gang and smash it!\"\n\nAn orderly brought in a telegraphic dispatch and handed it to him. The\nVice-president opened it, glanced through it, and tried to hand it to\nthe Secretary of State. Instead, it fluttered from his nerveless\nfingers, and he sank back with a groan. The Secretary picked it up and\nglanced at it.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, trying to control his voice, \"New York was\nbombed out of the blue at sunrise this morning, and the whole lower\npart of the city is a heap of ruins.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the days that followed it became clear that all the resources of\nAmerica would be needed to cope with the Invisible Empire. Not a day\npassed without some blow being struck. Boston, Charleston, Baltimore,\nPittsburg in turn were devastated. Three cruisers and a score of minor\ncraft were sunk in the harbor of Newport News, where they were\nconcentrating, and thenceforward the fleet became a fugitive force,\nseeking concealment rather than an offensive. Trans-Atlantic\nsea-traffic ceased.\n\nMeanwhile the black gas was being hurriedly manufactured. From\ncylinders placed in central positions in a score of cities it was\ndischarged continuously, covering these centers with an impenetrable\npall of night that no light would penetrate. Only by the glow of\nradium paint, which commanded fabulous prices, could official business\nbe transacted, and that only to a very small degree.\n\nCourts were closed, business suspended, prisoners released, perforce,\nfrom jails. Famine ruled. The remedy was proving worse than the\ndisease. Within a week the use of the dark gas had had to be\ndiscontinued. And a temporary suspension of the raids served only to\naccentuate the general terror.\n\nThere were food riots everywhere, demands that the Government come to\nterms, and counter-demands that the war be fought out to the bitter\nend.\n\nFought out, when everything was disorganized? Stocks of food congested\nall the terminals, mobs rioted and battled and plundered all through\nthe east.\n\n\"It means surrender,\" was voiced at the Council meeting by one of the\nmembers. And nobody answered him.\n\nThree days of respite, then, instead of bombs, proclamations\nfluttering down from a cloudless sky. Unless the white flag of\nsurrender was hoisted from the summit of the battered Capitol, the\nInvisible Emperor would strike such a blow as should bring America to\nher knees!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a twelve-hour ultimatum, and before three hours had passed\nthousands of citizens had taken possession of the Capitol and filled\nall the approaches. Over their heads floated banners--the Stars and\nStripes, and, blazoned across them the words, \"No Surrender.\"\n\nIt was a spontaneous uprising of the people of Washington. Hungry,\nhomeless in the sharpening autumn weather, and nearly all bereft of\nmembers of their families, too often of the breadwinner, now lying\ndeep beneath the rubble that littered the streets, they had gathered\nin their thousands to protest against any attempt to yield.\n\nDick, flying overhead at the apex of his squadron, felt his heart\nswell with elation as he watched the orderly crowds. This was at three\nin the afternoon: at six the ultimatum ended, the new frightfulness\nwas to begin.\n\nAt five, Vice-president Tomlinson was to address the crowds. The old\nman had risen to the occasion. He had cast off his pompousness and\nvanity, and was known to favor war to the bitter end. Dick and his\nsquadron circled above the broken dome as the car that carried the\nVice-president and the secretaries of State and for War approached\nalong the Avenue.\n\nRat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat!\n\nOut of the blue sky streams of lead were poured into the assembled\nmultitudes. Instantly they had become converted into a panic-stricken\nmob, turning this way and that.\n\nRat-a-tat-tat. Swaths of dead and dying men rolled in the dust, and,\nas wheat falls under the reaper's blade, the mob melted away in lines\nand by battalions. Within thirty seconds the whole terrain was piled\nwith dead and dying.\n\n\"My God, it's massacre! It's murder!\" shouted Dick.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey had not even waited for the twelve hours to expire. To and fro\nthe invisible airplanes shot through the blue evening sky, till the\nlast fugitives were streaming away in all directions like hunted deer,\nand the dead lay piled in ghastly heaps everywhere.\n\nOut of these heaps wounded and dying men would stagger to their feet\nto shake their fists impotently at their murderers.\n\nIn vain Dick and his squadron strove to dash themselves into the\ninvisible airships. The pilots eluded them with ease, sometimes\nsending a contemptuous round of machine-gun bullets in their\ndirection, but not troubling to shoot them down.\n\nTwo small boys, carrying a huge banner with \"No Surrender\" across it,\nwere walking off the ghastly field. Twelve or fourteen years old at\nmost, they disdained to run. They were singing, singing the National\nAnthem, though their voices were inaudible through the turmoil.\n\nRat-tat! Rat-tat-a-tat! The fiends above loosed a storm of lead upon\nthem. Both fell. One rose, still clutching the banner in his hand and\nwaved it aloft. In a sudden silence his childish treble could be\nheard:\n\n     My country, 'tis of thee\n     Sweet land of  lib-er-ty--\n\nThe guns rattled again. Clutching the blood-stained banner, he dropped\nacross the body of his companion.\n\nSuddenly a broad band of black soared upward from the earth. Those in\ncharge of the cylinders placed about the Capitol had released the gas.\n\nA band of darkness, rising into the blue, cutting off the earth,\nmaking the summit of the ruined Capitol a floating dome. But, fast as\nit rose, the invisible airships rose faster above it.\n\nA last vicious volley! Two of Dick's flight crashing down upon the\npiles of dead men underneath! And nothing was visible, though the\ndarkness rose till it obliterated the blue above.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt dawn the Council sat, after an all-night meeting. Vice-president\nTomlinson, one arm shattered by a machine-gun bullet, still occupied\nthe chair at the head of the table.\n\nOutside, immediately about the White House, there was not a sound.\nWashington might have been a city of the dead. The railroad terminals,\nhowever, were occupied by a mob of people, busily looting. There was\ngreat disorder. Organized government had simply disappeared.\n\nEach man was occupied only with obtaining as much food as he could\ncarry, and taking his family into rural districts where the Terror\nwould not be likely to pursue. All the roads leading out of\nWashington--into Virginia, into Maryland, were congested with columns\nof fugitives that stretched for miles.\n\nSome, who were fortunate enough to possess automobiles, and--what was\nrarer--a few gallons of gas, were trying to force their way through\nthe masses ahead of them; here and there a family trudged beside a\npack-horse, or a big dog drew an improvised sled on wheels, loaded\nwith flour, bacon, blankets, pillows. Old men and young children\ntrudged on uncomplaining.\n\nThe telegraph wires were still, for the most part, working. All the\nworld knew what was happening. From all the big cities of the East a\nsimilar exodus was proceeding. There was little bitterness and little\ndisorder.\n\nIt was not the airship raids from which these crowds were fleeing.\nSomething grimmer was happening. The murderous attack upon the\npopulace about the Capitol had been merely an incident. This later\ndevelopment was the fulfilment of the Invisible Emperor's ultimatum.\n\nDeath was afield, death, invisible, instantaneous, and inevitable.\nDeath blown on the winds, in the form of the deadliest of unknown\ngases.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the Blue Room of the White House a score of experts had gathered.\nDick, too, with the chiefs of his staff, Stopford, and the army and\nnaval heads. Among them was the chief of the Meteorological Bureau,\nand it was to him primarily that Tomlinson was reading a telegraphic\ndispatch from Wilmington, South Carolina:\n\n\"The Invisible Death has reached this point and is working havoc\nthroughout the city, spreading from street to street. Men are dropping\ndead everywhere. A few have fled, but--\"\n\nThe sudden ending of the dispatch was significant enough. Tomlinson\npicked up another dispatch from Columbia, in the same State:\n\n\"Invisible Death now circling city,\" he read. \"Business section\nalready invaded. All other telegraphists have left posts. Can't say\nhow long--\"\n\nAnd this, too, ended in the same way. There were piles of such\ncommunications, and they had been coming in for eighteen hours. At\nthat moment an orderly brought in a dozen more.\n\nTomlinson showed the head of the Meteorological Bureau the chart upon\nthe table. \"We've plotted out a map as the wires came in, Mr. Graves,\"\nhe said. \"The Invisible Death struck the southeast shore of the United\nStates yesterday afternoon near Charleston. It has spread\napproximately at a steady rate. The wind velocity--?\"\n\n\"Remains constant. Seventy miles an hour. Dying down a little,\"\nanswered Graves.\n\n\"The death line now runs from Wilmington, South Carolina, straight to\nAugusta, Georgia,\" the Vice-president pursued. \"Every living thing\nthat this gas has encountered has been instantly destroyed. Men,\ncattle, birds, vermin, wild beasts. The gas is invisible and\ninodorous. These gentlemen believe it may be a form of hydrocyanic\nacid, but of a concentration beyond anything known to chemistry, so\ndeadly that a billionth part of it to one of air must be fatal,\notherwise it could not have traveled as it has done. Warnings have\nbeen broadcasted, but there are no stocks of chemicals that might\ncounteract it. Flight is the only hope--flight at seventy miles an\nhour!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis voice shook. \"This gas has been loosed, as you told us, upon the\nwings of the hurricane that came through the Florida Strait. What are\nthe chances of its reaching Washington?\"\n\n\"Mr. Vice-president, if the wind continues, and this gas has\nsufficient concentration, it should be in Washington within the next\neight hours.\" Graves replied. \"If the wind changes direction,\nhowever, this gas will probably be blown out to sea, or into the\nAlleghanies, where it will probably be dissipated among the hills, or\nby the foliage on the mountains. I'm not a chemist--\"\n\n\"No, sir, and I am not consulting you as one,\" answered old Tomlinson.\n\"A death belt several hundred miles in length and three or four\nhundred deep has already been cut across this continent. We are faced\nwith wholesale, unmitigated murder, on such a scale as was never known\nbefore. But we are an integral part of America, and Washington has no\nmore right to expect immunity than our devastated Southern States. The\nquestion we wish to put to you is, can you trace the exact course\ntaken by the hurricane?\"\n\n\"I can, Mr. Vice-president,\" answered Graves. \"It originated somewhere\nin the West Indian seas, like all these storms. We've been getting our\nreports almost as usual. Our first one came from Nassau, which was\nbadly damaged. The storm missed the Florida coast, as many of them do,\nand struck the coast of South Carolina--in fact, we received a report\nfrom Charleston, which must have almost coincided with your first\nreport of the gas.\"\n\n\"If the storm missed the Florida coast, it follows that the gas was\nnot discharged from any point on the American continent,\" said\nTomlinson. \"From some point off Florida--from some island, or from a\nplane or from a ship at sea.\"\n\n\"Not from a ship at sea, Mr. Vice-president,\" interposed the head of\nthe Chemical Bureau. \"To discharge gas on such an extensive scale\nwould require more space than could be furnished by the largest\nvessel, in my opinion.\"\n\n\"In all probability the gas was 'loaded,' so to say, onto the gale\nsomewhere in the Bahamas,\" said Graves. \"That seems to me the most\nlikely explanation.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVice-president Tomlinson nodded, and picked up one of the latest\ntelegraphic dispatches, as if absently.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"the Invisible Death has already reached\nCharlotte.\"\n\nHe picked up another. \"Reported Abaco Island, Bahamas, totally wrecked\nby storm. All communication has ceased,\" he read. He turned to Dick\nand spoke as if inspired. \"Captain Rennell, there is your\ndestination,\" he thundered. \"They've betrayed themselves. We've got\nthem now. You understand?\"\n\n\"By God, sir! It's from Abaco Island, then, that those devils have\nbeen carrying on their game of wholesale murder!\"\n\nSuddenly a contagion of enthusiasm seemed to sweep the whole\nassemblage. Every man was upon his feet in an instant, white,\nquivering, lips opened for speech that trembled there and did not\ncome.\n\nIt was Secretary Norris spoke. \"The Vice-president has hit the mark,\"\nhe said, with a dramatic gesture of his arm. \"Yes, they've betrayed\nthemselves. Their headquarters are on Abaco Island. It's one of the\nlargest in the Bahamas.\" He turned to the Secretary for the Navy. \"You\ncan rush the fleet there, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\"Within forty-eight hours I'll have every vessel that can float off\nAbaco Island.\"\n\n\"I'll concentrate all airplanes. Take your flight, Captain Rennell.\nWe'll stamp out that nest of murderers if we blow Abaco Island to the\nbottom of the sea. It can be done!\"\n\n\"It can be done, sir--with Luke Evans and his invention,\" answered\nDick.\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_On the Trail_\n\nThree hours later, about the time when the war council rose after\ncompleting its plans, a sudden shift of the wind blew the poison gas\nout to sea, just when it appeared certain that it would reach the\ncapital of the nation.\n\nThe southern half of Virginia had been swept over. Operators,\ntelegraph and telephone, staying at their posts had sent in constant\nmessages that had terminated with an abruptness which told of the\ntragic sequel. Yet, at that distance from its source, the intensity of\nthe gas had been to some extent dissipated.\n\nPoisonous beyond any gas known, so deadly as to make hydrocyanic gas\ninnocuous in comparison, still as it was swept northward on the wings\nof the wind, there had been an increasing number of non-fatal\ncasualties. The most northernly point reached by the gas was Richmond,\nand here some fifty per cent of those stricken had suffered paralysis\ninstead of death.\n\nBut a new element had been injected into the situation. Even the\nheroic courage shown by the populace in the beginning had had its\nlimits. The morning after the news of the Invisible Death's advent was\nmade public mobs had gathered in all the large cities of the East,\ndemanding surrender.\n\nThe submerged elements of crime and disorder had come to the surface\nat last. Committees were formed, with the avowed object of yielding to\nthe Invisible Emperor, and averting further disaster. In Washington, a\ncity of the dead, half the members of Congress and the Senators had\ngathered in the ruined Capitol, to debate the situation.\n\nThere were rumors of an impending march on the White House, of a coup\nd'\u00e8tat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe action of the Government was prompt. Five hundred loyalists were\nenrolled, armed, and posted round the White House: every avenue of\napproach was commanded by machine-guns. Meanwhile the news was spread\nby radio that the headquarters of the Invisible Emperor had been\nlocated, and that a strong bombing squadron was being dispatched to\ndestroy it.\n\nThe entire fleet was to follow, and it was confidently anticipated\nthat within a little while the Terror would be at an end.\n\nThose at the white House were less sanguine. There was none but\nrealized the diabolical strength of their antagonists.\n\n\"Everything depends upon the outcome of the next forty-eight hours,\nand everything depends on you, Rennell,\" said Secretary Norris to\nDick, as he stood beside his plane. Behind him his flight of a dozen\nairships was drawn up.\n\n\"Find them,\" added the Secretary; \"cover Abaco Island with the black\ngas, and the navy and the marines will wipe up the mess that you leave\nbehind you. God help you--and all of us, Rennell!\"\n\nHe gripped Dick's hand and turned away. Dick was very sober-minded as\nhe climbed into his cockpit. He knew to the full how much depended\nupon himself and Luke Evans. Already the shouts of the insurgents were\nto be heard at the ends of the barriers, commanded by the\nmachine-guns, and patrolled by the enlisted volunteers.\n\nNegro mobs were building counter-barricades of their own with rubble\nfrom the fallen edifices. Civil war might be postponed for\neight-and-forty hours, but after that unless there was news of\nvictory, the whole structure of civilization would be smashed\nirreparably.\n\nIt was up to Dick and Luke Evans, and they had assumed such a\nresponsibility as rarely falls to the lot of man in war.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDick was to lead the flight in a two-seater Barwell plane. This was\none of the latest types, and had been hurriedly adapted to the purpose\nfor which it was to be used. Dick himself occupied the rear seat, with\nits dual controls, and the gun in its armored casing. In front sat old\nLuke Evans, in charge of the black gas projector.\n\nHis famous camera box, containing a minute quantity of gas in slow\ncombustion, and projecting the black searchlight, had been built into\nthe plane. In the rack beside him were a number of the black gas\nbombs, each of which, dropped to earth, would release enough gas to\ncover a considerable area with darkness. Both Luke and Dick wore\nrespirators filled with charcoal and sodium thio-sulphate, and beside\nDick a cage containing three guinea-pigs rested.\n\nThese little rodents were so sensitive to atmospheric changes that a\nquantity of hydrocyanic acid too minute to affect a man would produce\ninstantaneous death on them.\n\nFrom its hiding-place off the Virginia coast the American fleet was\nsteaming hotly southward toward Abaco Island, cruisers, destroyers,\nsubmarines. That Abaco was British territory had simply not been\nconsidered in this crisis of history.\n\nThe twelve airships that followed Dick's contained enough bombs to put\nthe headquarters of the Invisible Empire out of business for good. The\nnaval guns would complete the same business.\n\nAll day Dick and Luke Evans flew southwestward. At first glance,\neverything appeared normal. The catastrophe that had fallen upon the\nland was visible only in the shape of the lines of tiny figures,\nextending for miles, that choked all the roads radiating out of the\nprincipal cities. It was only when they were over the southern portion\nof Virginia that the ravages of deadly gas became apparent.\n\nFlying low, Dick could see the fields strewn with the bodies of dead\ncattle. Here and there, at the doors of farmhouses, the inmates could\nbe seen, lying together in gruesome heaps, caught and killed\ninstantaneously as they attempted flight. Here, too, were figures on\nthe roads. But they were figures of dead men and women.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey strewed the roads for miles, lying as they had been trapped--men,\nwomen, children, horses, mules, and dogs. The spectacle was an\nappalling one. Dick set his jaws grimly. He was thinking that the\nCouncil had let Von Kettler escape. He was thinking of Fredegonde. But\nhe would not let himself think of her. She deserved no more pity than\nthe rest of the murderous crew.\n\nOver the Carolinas the conditions were still more appalling. Here\ndeadly gas had struck with all its concentrated power. A city\nmaterialized out of the blue distance, a factory town with all\nchimneys spiring upward into the blue, a section of tall buildings\nintersected by canyonlike streets, around it a rim of trim houses,\nbungalows, indicative of prosperity and comfort. And it was a city of\nthe dead.\n\nFor everywhere around it, on all the roads, the dead lay piled on top\nof one another. For miles--all the inhabitants, rich and poor,\nbusiness men, factory hands, negroes. There had been a mad rush as the\nfatal gas drove onward upon its lethal way, and all the fugitives had\nbeen overwhelmed simultaneously.\n\nHere were golf links, with little groups strewn on the grass and\nfairways; here, at one of the holes, four men, their putters still in\ntheir hands, crouched in death. Here was the wreckage of a train that\nhad collided with a string of freight cars at an untended switch, and\nfrom the shattered windows the heads and bodies of the dead protruded\nin serried ranks.\n\nDick looked back. His flight was driving on behind him. He guessed\ntheir feelings. They had sworn, as he had sworn, that none of them\nwould return without stamping out that abomination from the earth\nforever.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe signaled to the flight to rise, and zoomed upward to twelve\nthousand feet. He did not want to look upon any more of those horrors.\nAt that height, the peaceful landscape lay extended underneath, in a\nchecker-board of farms and woodlands. One could pretend that it was\nall a vile dream.\n\nHe avoided Charleston, and winged out above the Atlantic, striking a\nstraight course along the coast toward the Bahamas. The shores of\nGeorgia vanished in the west. Dick began to breathe more freely. His\nmind shook off its weight of horror. Only the blue sea and the blue\nsky were visible The aftermath of the gale remained in the shape of a\nstrong head breeze and white crests below.\n\nDick glanced at the guinea-pigs. They were busily gnawing their\ncabbage and carrots. The gas had evidently been entirely dissipated by\nthe wind.\n\nToward sunset the low jutting fore-land of Canaveral on the east coast\nof Florida, came into view. Dick shifted course a little. Three hours\nmore should see them over Abaco.\n\nHis flight had explicit instructions. As soon as the black gas had\nrendered visible the headquarters of the Invisible Emperor, they were\nto circle above, dropping their bombs. When these were exhausted, the\nmachine guns would come into play. There was to be no attention paid\nto signals of surrender. They were to wipe out the headquarters, to\nkill every living thing that showed itself--and the navy and the\nmarines would mop up anything left over.\n\nThe sun went down in a blaze of gold and crimson. Night fell. The moon\nbegan to climb the east. The black sea, stretching beneath, was as\nempty as on the day when it was created. Nothing in the shape of\nnavigation appeared.\n\nTwo hours, three hours, and old Evans turned round in his cockpit and\npointed. On the horizon a black thread was beginning to stretch\nagainst the sky. It was Abaco Island, in the Bahama group. They were\nnearly at their destination. An hour more--perhaps two hours, and the\ndeadly menace that threatened America might be removed forever. Dick\nbreathed a silent prayer for success.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were over Abaco. A long, flat island, seventy miles or so in\nextreme length, and fairly wide, covered with a dense growth of\ntropical brush and forest, with here and there open spaces, near the\nseacoast an occasional farm-house. Dick dropped to five thousand, to\nthree, to one. The moon made the whole land underneath as bright as\nday.\n\nThere were no evidence of destruction by the hurricane. The farmhouses\nstood substantial and well roofed. If death had struck Abaco Island,\nit had been the work of man, not Nature.\n\nDick zoomed almost to his ceiling, until, in the brilliant moonlight,\nhe could see Abaco Island from side to side. For the most part it was\nheavily wooded with mahogany and lignum vitae: toward the central\nportion there was open land, but there was not the least sign of any\nconstruction work.\n\nAgain he swooped, indicating to his flight to follow him. At a\nthousand feet he examined the open district intently. Here, if\nanywhere upon the island, the Invisible Emperor had his headquarters.\nWas it conceivable that a gas factory, hangars, ammunition depots\ncould exist here invisibly, when he could look straight down upon the\nground?\n\nDick's heart sank. The hideous fear came to him that Graves had been\nmistaken, that he had come on a wild-goose chase. This could not be\nthe place. It was quite incredible.\n\nAgain and again he circled, studying the ground beneath. Now he could\nsee that the tough grass and undergrowth marked curious geometrical\npatterns. Here, for example, was an oblong of bare earth around which\nthe vegetation grew, and it was obviously the work of man.\n\nHere were four squares of bare ground set side by side, with thin\nstrips of vegetation growing between them.\n\nThen of a sudden Dick knew! Those squares and parallelograms of bare\nground indicated the foundations of buildings. _He was looking down on\nthe very site of the Invisible Emperor's stronghold!_\n\nHe shouted, and pointed downward. Luke Evans looked round and nodded.\nHe understood. He patted the camera-box with a grim smile on his old\nface.\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_The Magnetic Trap_\n\nUpon those squares and oblongs of bare earth, incredible as it seemed,\nrose the structures of the Invisible Empire, themselves both invisible\nand transparent, so that one looked straight down through them and saw\nonly the ground beneath them.\n\nEvery interior floor and girder must have been treated with the gas.\nThey had been cunning. They must have discovered some permanent means\nof charging paint with the shadow-breaking gas, so that the buildings\nwould remain invisible for months and years instead of hours.\n\nBut they had not been cunning enough. It had not occurred to them that\nthe foundations would still be visible underneath, for the simple\nreason that grass does not grow without sunlight.\n\nDick saw old Luke Evans nodding and pointing downward. The old man\npicked up his end of the speaking-tube, but Dick ignored the gesture.\nHe signaled to his flight to rise, and zoomed up, circling, and\nstudying the land beneath.\n\nThat oblong was evidently the central building. Those four squares\nprobably housed airplanes, and each would hold half a dozen. That\nelliptical building might contain a dirigible. That round patch was\nprobably the gas factory.\n\nNow Dick could see more patches of bare ground, extending in the\ndirection of the sea. He gunned his ship and followed the gap among\nthe trees to the ocean, a few miles distant. Yes, there were more\nevidence of activity here. Beside the water, in what looked like a\ndeep natural harbor, was what seemed to be the foundations of a dock.\nPerhaps even vessels of war floated on the phosphorescent Bahama sea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe circled back, his flock wheeling like a flight of birds and\nfollowing him. He signaled to them to scatter. They had certainly been\nobserved; at any moment a hail of lead might assail them invisibly out\nof the air. They must get to work quickly. But had they understood the\nsignificance of those bare patches?\n\nDick saw Luke Evans still fidgeting impatiently with his end of the\nspeaking-tube, and picked it up.\n\n\"I'm thinking, Captain Rennell, we've got no time to lose if we want\nto keep the upper hand of those devils,\" called the old man.\n\n\"Yes, you're right,\" Dick answered. \"Lay a trail of gas bombs all\naround those hangars and buildings, enough to hold them dark for some\ntime. And keep a bomb or two in reserve.\"\n\nLuke Evans shouted back. The plane was again above the structures. The\nold man dropped a bomb over the side, and Dick zoomed again, his\nflight wheeling up behind him.\n\nHigher and higher, banking and going round in a succession of tight\nspirals, Dick flew. Every moment he expected the blow to fall. As he\nrose, Luke Evans dropped bomb after bomb. A thousand feet beneath the\nflight was taking up positions, hovering with the helicopters, looking\nup to Dick for the signal, and waiting.\n\nThen from beneath the cloud of black gas began to rise, as Luke Evans\ndropped his bombs. It filled the lower spaces of the sky, blotting out\nthe land in impenetrable darkness. That darkness, above which Dick and\nhis flight were soaring, rose like a solid wall, built by some\nprehistoric race that aimed to fling a tower into the heavens.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then--the miracle! Dick gasped in sheer delight as he realized\nthat he had made no mistake.\n\nAt first all he could see was a number of criss-crossing\nphosphorescent lines that appeared shimmering through the blackness\nunderneath. They ran luminously here and there, forming no particular\npattern, much like the figures on the radium dial of a watch when\nfirst they come into wavering visibility at night.\n\nThen the lines began to intersect one another, to assume geometric\npatterns and curves. And bit by bit they took meaning and\nsignificance.\n\nAnd suddenly the whole invisible stronghold lay revealed upon the\nground beneath, a shining, dazzling play of weaving light.\n\nBuildings and hangars stood out, clearly revealed; the rounded vault\nof a dirigible hangar, and the shining ribbon of a road that ran\nthrough a pitch-dark tarmac, and was evidently constructed from some\ngas-impregnated materials. On this tarmac was a flight of shining\nairplanes, ready to take off. There were the odd, ovoid figures of the\naviators in their silken overalls. More figures appeared, running out\nfrom the buildings. It was clear that the sudden raid had taken them\nall by surprise.\n\nLuke Evans yelled and pointed. \"We've got them now, sir!\" Dick heard\nabove the whine of the helicopter engine. \"We've--\"\n\nBut of a sudden the old man's voice died away, though his mouth was\nstill moving.\n\nDick leaned out of his cockpit and fired a single red Very light, the\nsignal for the attack. And from each plane of his flight, beneath him,\na bomb slid from its rack and went hurtling down upon the gang below,\nwhile the airplanes circled and hovered, each taking up its station.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDick was too late. By a whole minute he had missed his chance. He\nrealized that immediately, for before the red light had flared from\nhis pistol, the hostile planes were in the air. He had flown too low,\nand given the alarm.\n\nIt meant a fight now, instead of a mad dog destruction, and Dick did\nnot underestimate the power of the enemy. But he felt a thrill of\nfurious satisfaction at the prospect of battle. From every plane the\nbombs were falling. Underneath, ruin and destruction, and leaping\nflames--and yet darkness, save for the phosphorescent outlines of the\nbuildings.\n\nAnd the lines of these were broken, converging into strange\ncriss-crosses of luminosity, as the beams fell in shapeless heaps.\nDark fire, sweeping through the headquarters of the Invisible Emperor,\na veritable hell for those below! A taste of the hell that they had\nmade for others!\n\nThen a strange phenomenon obtruded itself upon Dick's notice. _Nothing\nwas audible!_ The bombs were falling, but they were falling silently.\nNo sound came up from beneath. And, except for the throbbing of his\nengine, Dick would have thought it had stopped. He could no longer\nhear it.\n\nThat terrific holocaust of death and destruction was inaudible.\nSkimming the upper reach of the air, high above that wall of darkness,\nDick saw old Luke Evans pick up his end of the speaking-tube, and\nmechanically followed suit. He could see the old man's lips moving.\nBut he heard nothing!\n\nAnd now another phenomenon was borne in on his notice. His flight were\nperhaps five hundred feet beneath him, hovering a little above the\nbarrage of black gas. But they were converging oddly. And there was no\nsight of the airplanes that Dick had just seen taking off from the\ninvisible tarmac.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDick fired two Very lights as a signal to his flight to scatter. What\nwere they doing, bunching together like a flock of sheep, when at any\nmoment the enemy planes might come swooping in, riddling them with\nbullets? He thrust the stick forward--and then realized that his\ncontrols had gone dead!\n\nHe thought for a moment that a wire had snapped. But the stick\nresponded perfectly to his hand, only it had no longer control over\nhis plane. He kicked right rudder, and the plane remained motionless.\nHe pushed home the soaring lever, to neutralize the helicopter and the\nplane still soared.\n\nThen he noticed that the needle of his earth-inductor\ncompass-indicator was oscillating madly, and realized that it was not\nhis plane that was at fault.\n\nUnderneath him, his flight seemed to be milling wildly as the ships\nturned in every direction of the compass. But not for long. They were\nnosing in, until the whole flight resembled an enormous airplane\nengine, with twelve radial points, corresponding to their propellers,\nand the noses pointing symmetrically inward, like a herd of game,\nyarding in winter time.\n\nAnd now the true significance came home to Dick. A vertical line of\nmagnetic force, an invisible mast, had been shot upward from the\nground. The airplanes were moored to it by their noses, as effectively\nas if they had been fastened with steel wires.\n\nAnd he, too, was struggling against that magnetic force that was\nslowly drawing him, despite his utmost efforts, to a fixed position\nfive hundred feet above his flight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a few moments, by feeding his engine gas to the limit, Dick\nthought he might have a chance of escaping. Her nose a fixed point,\nDick whirled round and round in a dizzy maze, attempting to break that\ninvisible mooring-chain. Then suddenly the engine went dead. He was\ntrapped helplessly.\n\nHe saw old Evans gesticulating wildly in the front cockpit. The old\nman hoisted himself, leaned over the cowling gibbered in Dick's ear.\nThe silent engine had ceased to throb, and the old man's shouts were\nsimply not translated into sound.\n\nSuddenly the flight beneath jerked downward, just as a flag jerks when\nit is hauled down a pole. They vanished into the dark cloud beneath.\nAt the same time there came a jerk that dropped Dick's plane a hundred\nfeet, and flung him violently against the rim of the cockpit.\n\nAnother followed. By drops of a hundred feet at a time, Dick was being\nhauled down into the darkness underneath him.\n\nIt rushed up at him. One moment he was suspended upon the rim of it,\nseeing the moon and stars above him; the next he had been plunged into\nutter blackness. Blackness more intense than anything that could be\nconceived--soundless blackness, that was the added horror of it.\nBlackness of Luke Evans's contriving, but none the less fearful on\nthat account!\n\nAnd yet, as Dick was jerked slowly downward, slowly a pale visibility\nbegan to diffuse itself underneath. The black cloud was beginning to\nroll away. The luminous lines began to fade, and in place of them\nappeared little leaping tongues of fire. In front of him Dick saw Luke\nEvans's form begin to pattern itself upon the darkness. He saw the\nform move sidewise, and caught at Luke's arm as he was about to hurl\nanother gas bomb. \"No!\" he shouted--and heard no sound come from his\nlips.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLuke understood. He seemed to be replacing the bomb in the rack.\nBeneath them now, as they were jerked downward, were fantastic swirls\nof black mist, and, at the bottom, a pit of fire that was slowly\ncoming into visibility.\n\nDick uttered a cry of horror! Five hundred feet below his plane he saw\nthe dim forms of his flight, still bunched together, noses almost\ntouching. And they were dropping straight into that flaming furnace\nof ruin underneath, which was growing clearer every instant.\n\nDown, jerk by jerk. Down! The black cloud was fast dispersing from the\nground. The flight were hardly a thousand feet above the fire. Down--a\nlong jerk that one! Once more! The flames leaped up hungrily about the\ndoomed airships. Cries of mad horror broke from Dick's lips as he\nwitnessed the destruction of ships and men.\n\nHe could see almost clearly now. The twelve ships, still retaining\ntheir nose-to-nose formation, were in the very heart of the fire.\nSpurts of exploding gasoline thrust their white tongues upward. There\nwas only one consolation: for the doomed men, death must have come\npractically instantaneously.\n\nFrom where he hung, Dick could feel the fierce heat of the flames\nbelow. In front of him, old Luke Evans sat in his cockpit like one\npetrified. He was feebly fumbling at his camera-box, as if he had some\nidea of using it, and had forgotten that it was fixed to the plane,\nbut the old man seemed temporarily to have lost his wits.\n\nRushing flames surrounded the burning airships, reducing them to a\nsolid, welded mass of incandescent metal. Dick looked down, waiting\nfor the next jerk that would summon him to join his men. At the moment\nhe was not conscious of either fear or horror, only intense rage\nagainst the murderers and regret that he could never bring back the\nnews of victory.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cloud had almost dissipated. In place of the phosphorescence,\nelectric lights had appeared, making the ground beneath perfectly\nvisible. Dick could see a number of men grouped together at the\nentrance to a large building, part of which had been wrecked by a\nbomb, though there were no evidences of fire. Other structures had\nbeen dismantled and knocked about, but what remained of them had not\nbeen charred by fire. Evidently they had been fireproofed. Perhaps the\ngas itself was incombustible. Only in the middle of the tarmac, where\nthe remnants of the airplanes blazed, was there any sign of fire.\n\nThere were three machines resembling dynamos, placed one at each\ncorner of the tarmac, equidistant from the central holocaust. A\nhalf-dozen men were grouped about each of them, and by the light from\nthe huge reflector over each Dick saw that they were whirring busily.\nAt the time it did not occur to him that these were the machines that\nwere sending out the electrical force that had held the airplanes\npowerless.\n\nBut as he looked, his mind still a turmoil of hate and hopeless anger,\nhe saw one of the three machines cease whirring. The group about it\ndispersed, the light above went out. And now his plane, as if drawn by\nthe power of the two remaining machines, began to move jerkily again,\nnot down toward the burning wreckage, but sidewise, away from it.\n\nStraight out toward the side of the tarmac it moved jerked downward\ndiagonally, until it rested only a few feet above the ground.\n\nThen suddenly Dick felt the plane quiver, as if released from the\npower of the force that had held it. It nosed down and crashed, rolled\nover amid the wreckage of a shattered wing. The concussion shot Dick\nfrom the cockpit clear of the smashed machine.\n\nHe landed upon his head, and went out instantly.\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_The Invisible Emperor_\n\nIt was the sound of his name, spoken repeatedly, that brought Dick\nback to consciousness. He opened his eyes, blinking in broad daylight.\nHe stared about him, and the first thing he saw was Luke Evans,\nregarding him anxiously from a little distance away. He saw that it\nwas Luke who had spoken.\n\nHe had heard the old man distinctly. The condition of inaudibility was\ngone.\n\nNot that of invisibility. Dick stared about him in bewilderment. For a\nmoment, before he quite realized what had happened to him, he thought\nhe had lost his mind. Underneath him was a thick rug, beneath his head\na pillow; he could feel both of them, and yet all he could see was the\nopen country, a clearing with shrubbery on either side, and, beyond\nthat, a luxurious growth of tropical trees. Under him, to all visual\nappearance, was the bare ground.\n\nHe moved, and heard the clank of chains. He looked down at himself.\nHis wrists were loosely linked to a chain that seemed to stretch tight\ninto vacancy and end in nothing. His ankles were bound likewise.\n\nAnd both chains appeared to be of solid silver, but thick enough to\ngive them the strength of iron!\n\nThen he perceived that old Evans was bound in the same way.\n\n\"Rennell! Rennell!\" repeated the old man in a sort of whimper. \"Thank\nGod you've come out of it! I was afraid you were dead.\"\n\n\"What's happened?\" asked Dick. \"Where are we? Didn't they get us?\"\n\n\"They've got us, damn them!\" snarled old Evans. \"All the rest burned\nto cinders, those fine fellows, Rennell! You were thrown unconscious,\nbut none of my tough old bones were hurt. They pulled us out of the\nwreckage and brought us in here and tied us with these silver chains.\"\n\n\"In here? But where are we?\" demanded Dick, trying to pass his hand\nacross his aching forehead, and realizing that the chain, though it\nseemed fastened to nothing, was perfectly taut.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"In one of their damned invisible houses,\" whimpered the old man.\n\"They're fireproof. Nearly all our bombs fell on the tarmac, and they\ndid hardly any damage at all. One of those devils was bragging about\nit to me. I couldn't see anything but his eyes. And they've taken away\nmy gas-box,\" wailed old Luke.\n\nDick cursed comprehensively and was silent. The burning rage that\nfilled him left him incapable of other utterance. Silver chains! They\nmust be madmen--yes, that was the only explanation. Madmen who had\nescaped from somewhere, obtained possession of scientific secrets, and\nbanded themselves together to overcome the world. If he could get the\nchance of a blow at them before he died!\n\nHe heard a door swing open--a door somewhere out on the prairie. Two\nmen sprang into sudden visibility and approached him. There was\nnothing invisible about these men, though they had seemed to have\nmaterialized out of nothing. They wore the same black, trimly fitting\nuniform that Dick had seen in the White House. They were flesh and\nblood human beings like themselves.\n\n\"I congratulate you upon your recovery, Captain Rennell,\" remarked one\nof them with ironical politeness. \"Also upon your shrewd coup.\nNeedless to say, it had no chance of success, but we were misinformed\nas to the hour at which you might be expected. We thought it would\ntake the fools at Washington a little longer to puzzle out our\nlocation--and then we did not put quite sufficient force into our\nhurricane. Quite an artificial one, Captain.\"\n\nDick, glaring at them, said nothing, and the one who had spoken turned\nto his companion, laughing, and said something in a foreign language\nthat he did not recognize.\n\n\"His Majesty the Emperor commands your presence, and that of this old\nfool,\" said the first man. \"Do not attempt to escape us. Death will be\ninstantaneous.\" He drew a glass rod from his pocket, the tip of which\nglowed with a pale blue light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain he spoke to his companion, who moved apparently a few feet\ndistant out on the prairie. Suddenly Dick saw old Evans' chain\nslacken: then Dick's slackened too. He understood that he was unbound,\nthough his wrists and ankles were still loosely fastened.\n\nThe second man took his station beside Luke Evans and motioned to him\nto rise. The first man beckoned to Dick to do the same. The two\nprisoners got upon their feet, trailing each a length of clanking\nchain. Each of the two guards covered his captive with the glass rod\nand motioned to him to precede him.\n\nChoking with fury, Dick obeyed. He had taken a dozen steps with his\nguard uttered a sharp command to halt, at the same time shouting some\nword of command.\n\nThe edge of a door appeared, also seeming to materialize out of space.\nIt widened, and Dick realized that he was looking at the unpainted\ninner side of a door whose outside was invisible. Beyond the door\nappeared a flight of steps.\n\nDick passed through and descended them. He counted fifteen. He emerged\ninto a timbered underground passage, well lit with lamps, filled with\nwhat seemed to be mercury vapor. Behind him walked his guard: behind\nthe guard he heard Luke Evans shambling. Both chains were clinking,\nand again Dick's fury almost overcame him.\n\nHe controlled himself. He had no hope or desire for life, but he meant\nto strike some sort of blow before he died, if it were possible.\n\nThey turned out of the timbered passage, Dick's guard now walking at\nhis side, the glass rod menacing his back. Dick found himself in a\nlarge subterranean room of extraordinary character. The walls were not\nmerely timbered, but paneled. Pictures hung upon them, there were soft\nrugs underfoot, there was antique furniture. Everything was in plain\nsight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a door at the farther end, from beyond which came the murmur\nof voices. Two guards in the same black uniform, but without the\nornamental silver braid, stood to attention, long halberds in their\nhands. One spoke a challenge.\n\nThe guard at Dick's side answered. The two men stepped backward, each\nabout two feet, and pulled the two cords on either side of a curtain\nbehind the open door. Dick passed through.\n\nHe stopped in sheer amazement. The gorgeousness of this larger room\ninto which he entered was almost stupefying. It seemed to have been\nlifted bodily from some European palace. Mirrors with gilt edges ran\nalong the side. On the floor was a single huge rug of Oriental weave.\n\nAt the farther end was a throne of gilt, lined with red velvet in\nwhich sat a man. An old man, of perhaps eighty years, with a grey\npeaked beard and fierce, commanding features. On his head was a gold\ncrown glittering with gems. About him were gathered some twoscore men\nand a few women.\n\nThose ranged on either side of the throne wore, like its occupant,\nrobes of red, lined with ermine. The rank behind wore shorter robes,\nless decorative, but no less extraordinary. They might all have\nstepped out of some medieval court.\n\nBehind this second line, and half-encircling them, were officers in\nthe black uniform with the silver braid.\n\nThere had been chattering, but as Dick passed through into the room it\nwas succeeded by complete silence. Dick fixed his eyes upon the old\nman on the throne.\n\nHe knew him! Knew him for a once famous European ruler who had lost\nhis throne in the war. A man always of unbalanced mentality, who,\nafter living for years in exile, had been reported dead three years\nbefore. A madman who had vanished to make this last attempt upon the\nworld, aided and abetted by the secret group of nobles who had\nsurrounded him in the days of his pomp and power.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOld men, all of those in the first line! Madmen too, perhaps, as\nmadness begets madness. Behind them, younger men, infected by the\nstrange malady, and enthusiastic for their desperate cause.\n\nYes, Dick knew this Invisible Emperor, lurking here in his underground\npalace. He knew Von Kettler, too, in the second line, close to the\nEmperor's throne. And, among the women in their robes, grouped\npicturesquely about that throne, he knew Fredegonde Valmy.\n\nDark-haired beneath her coronet, of radiant beauty, she fixed her eyes\nupon Dick's. Not a muscle of her face quivered.\n\nThen only did Dick see something else, which he had not hitherto\nobserved, owing to its concealment by the robes of those grouped about\nthe Emperor, and the sight of it sent such a thrill of fury through\nhim that he stood where he was, unable to speak or move a muscle.\n\nThe throne was set on a sort of dais, with three steps in front of it.\nThe lowest of these steps was hollow. Within this hollow appeared the\nhead and shoulders of a man.\n\nAn elderly man clothed in parti-colored red and yellow, the\ntime-honored garment of court fools. He was on his hands and knees,\nand the round of his back fitted into the hollow of the step, and had\na flat board over it, so that the Emperor, in ascending his throne,\nwould place his foot upon it.\n\nHe was kept in that position with heavy chains of what looked like\ngold, which passed about his neck and arms, and fitted into heavy gold\nstaples in the wood. And the old man was President Hargreaves of the\nUnited States!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe President of the American Republic, chained as a footstool for the\nInvisible Emperor, the madman who defied the world. Dick stood\npetrified, staring into the mild face of the old man, still incapable\nof speech. Then a herald, carrying a long trumpet, to which a square\nbanner was attached, strode forward from one side of the grotesque\nassemblage.\n\n\"Dog, on your knees when His Majesty deigns to admit you to the\nPresence!\" he shouted.\n\nThe guard at Dick's side prodded him with his glass rod.\n\nThen the storm of mad fury in Dick's heart released limbs and voice.\nThe cry that came from his lips was like nothing human. He leaped upon\nthe guard with a swift uppercut that sent him sprawling.\n\nThe glass rod slipped from his hands to the rug, striking the edge of\nhis shoe, and broke to fragments. A single streak of fire shot from\nit, blasting a black streak across the Oriental rug.\n\nDick leaped toward the throne, and the assemblage, as if paralyzed by\nhis sudden maneuver, remained watching him without moving. Then a\nwoman screamed, and instantly the picturesque gathering had dissolved\ninto a mob placing itself about the person of the Emperor, who sprang\nfrom his throne in agitation.\n\nDick was almost at the steps. But it was not at the Emperor that he\nleaped. He sprang to Hargreaves's side. \"Mr. President, I'm an\nAmerican,\" he babbled. \"We've located this gang, we'll blow them off\nthe face of the earth. In chains--God, in chains, sir--\"\n\nDick stumbled over the length of his own chain that he had been\ndragging behind him--stumbled and fell prone upon the floor. Before he\ncould regain his feet they were upon him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA dozen men were holding him, despite his mad, frenzied struggles, and\nas, at length, he paused, exhausted, one of them, covering his head\nwith a glass rod, looked up at the Emperor, who had resumed his seat.\n\nDick calmed himself. Still gripped, he straightened his body, and gave\nthe mad monarch back look for look. For a moment the two men regarded\neach other. Then a peal of laughter broke from the Invisible Emperor's\nlips. And any one who heard that peal--any one save those accustomed\nto him--might have known that it was a madman's laughter.\n\nHe flung back his head and laughed, and the whole crowd laughed too.\nAll those sycophants roared and chuckled--all except Fredegonde. It\nwas not till afterward that Dick remembered that.\n\nHe stood up. \"Dog of an American,\" he roared, \"do you know why you\nwere brought here? It was because I wanted one Yankee to live and see\nthe irresistible powers that I exercise, so that he can go back and\nreport on them to those fools in Washington who still think they can\ndefy me, the messenger of the All-Highest.\n\n\"I tell you that the things I have done are nothing in comparison with\nthe things that I have yet to do, if your insane government of\npig-headed fools persists in its defiance. It is my plan to send you\nback to tell them that their President lies bound in gold chains as my\nfootstool. That the hurricane which spread the gas through southern\nAmerica was a mere summer zephyr in comparison with the storm that I\nshall send next.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"All the resources of Nature are at my command thanks to the\nillustrious chemists who have been secretly working for the past ten\nyears to serve me. I, the All-Highest, have been commanded by the\nAlmighty to scourge the world for its insolence in rejecting me, and\nespecially the pig-race of Yankees whose pride has grown so great.\nMine is the divinely appointed task to cast down your ridiculous\ndemocracies and re-establish the divine world-order of an Emperor and\nhis nobility.\n\n\"That is why I have chosen, to permit so mean a thing as you to live.\nAs for the old fool beside you, who thought to stay my power with his\nbox of tricks--his gas-box is already being analyzed by my chemists,\nand in a few hours the trivial secret will be at my disposal.\"\n\n\"And that's just where you're wrong,\" piped old Luke Evans in his\ncracked voice. \"That gas can't be analyzed, because it contains an\nunknown isotope, and, as for yourself, you're nothing but a daft old\nfool, with your tin-horn trumpery!\"\n\nFor a moment the Emperor stood like a statue, staring at old Luke. The\nexpression on his face was that of a madman, but a madman through\nwhose brain a straggling ray of realization has dawned. It was the\nlook upon his face that held the whole assemblage spellbound. Then\nsuddenly came intervention.\n\nThrough a doorway in the side of the hall came one of the officers in\nblack. He advanced to the foot of the throne and made a deep, hurried\nbow, speaking rapidly in some language incomprehensible to Dick.\n\nThe Emperor started, and then a peal of laughter left his lips.\n\n\"Pig of a Yankee,\" he shouted to Dick, \"your contemptible navy's now\napproaching our shores, with a dirigible scout above it. You shall now\nsee how I deal with such swine!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_The Tricks of the Trade_\n\nHe barked a command, and instantly Dick was seized by two of the\nguards, one of whom--the one Dick had knocked down--took the occasion\nto administer a buffeting in the process of overcoming him. For the\nsight of the honored President of the United States--that kindly old\nman straining his eyes to meet Dick's own--in the parti-colored garb\nof red and yellow, and chained like a beast below the madman's throne,\nagain filled Dick with a fury beyond all control.\n\nIt was only when he had been half-stunned again by the vicious blows\nof his captors, delivered with short truncheons of heavy wood, that at\nlength he desisted from his futile struggle.\n\nWith swimming eyes he looked upon the gathering about the throne,\nwhich, again taking its cue from the madman, way roaring with laughter\nat his antics. And again Dick's eyes encountered those of Fredegonde\nValmy.\n\nThe girl was not smiling. She was looking straight at him, and for a\nmoment it seemed to Dick as if he read some message in her eyes.\n\nOnly for an instant that idea flashed through his mind. He was in no\nmood to receive messages. As he stood panting like a wild beast at\nbay, suddenly a filmy substance was thrown over his head from behind.\nThen, as his face emerged, and the rest of his body was swiftly\nenveloped, he realized what was happening.\n\nThey had thrown over him one of the invisible garments. He could feel\nthe stuff about him, but he could no longer see his own body or limbs.\n\nFrom his own ken, Dick Rennell had vanished utterly. Where his legs\nand feet should have been, there was only the rug, with the burn from\nthe glass tube. He raised one arm and could not see arm or fingers.\n\nIn another moment invisible cords had been flung around him. Dick's\nefforts to renew the struggle were quickly cut short. Trussed\nhelplessly, he could only stand glaring at the madman rocking with\nlaughter upon his tinsel throne. Beside him, similarly bound, stood\nLuke Evans, but Dick was only conscious of the old man's presence by\nreason of the short, rasping, emphatic curses that broke from his\nlips.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Emperor turned on his throne and beckoned to Von Kettler, who\napproached with a deferential bow.\n\n\"Nobility, we charge you with the care of these two prisoners,\" he\naddressed him. \"Have the old one removed to the laboratory, and give\norders that he shall assist our chemists to the best of his power in\ntheir analysis of the black gas. As for the other, take him up to the\ncentral office, and show him how we deal with Yankees and all other\npigs. Show him everything, so that he may take back a correct account\nof our irresistible powers when we dismiss him.\"\n\n\"Come!\" barked one of the guards in Dick's ear.\n\nDick attempted no further resistance. Convinced of its futility, sick\nand reeling from the blows he had received, he accompanied his captors\nquietly. There was nothing more that he could do, either for President\nHargreaves or for old Luke, but he still imagined the possibility of\nsomehow warning the approaching fleet or the occupants of the\ndirigible.\n\nHe was led along the passage, past the guards, and up the stairs\nagain. The top door opened upon vacancy; it closed, and vanished. Dick\nfelt the rugs beneath his feet, but he was to all appearances standing\non a square of bare earth in the middle of a prairie.\n\n\"Come!\" barked the guard again, and Dick accompanied him, trailing his\nsilver chain. Behind came Von Kettler.\n\n\"Here are steps!\" said the guard, after they had proceeded a short\ndistance.\n\nDick stumbled against the lowest step of an invisible flight. The\nbreeze was cut off, showing that they had entered a building.\nUnderneath was a large oval of bare ground. Dick found a handrail and\ngroped his way up around a spiral staircase, four flights of it.\n\n\"Here is a room!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDick saw that widening edge of door again. The room inside was\nperfectly visible, though it seemed to be supported upon air. It was a\nspheroid, of huge size, with a number of large windows set into the\nwalls, and it was filled with machinery. About a dozen workmen in\nblue blouses were moving to and fro, attending to what appeared to be\na number of enormous dynamos, but there were other apparatus of whose\nsignificance Dick was ignorant. The dynamos were whirring with intense\nvelocity, but not the slightest sound was audible.\n\nVon Kettler stepped to a switch attached to a stanchion of white\nmetal, surmounted by a huge opaque glass dome, and threw it over.\nInstantly the hum and whir of machinery became audible, the sound of\nfootsteps, the voices of the workmen, and the creak of boards beneath\ntheir feet.\n\n\"You see, we have discovered the means of destroying sound waves as\nwell as shadows, and it was a much simpler feat,\" said Von Kettler\nwith a sneer. \"Tell them that when you get back to Washington, Yankee\npig. Also you might be interested to know that most of your bombs fell\non camouflaged structures that we had erected with the intention of\ndeceiving you.\"\n\nHe gestured to Dick to precede him, and halted him at a plain round\niron pipe or rod that rose up through the floor and passed through the\nroof. It was surrounded by a mesh of fine wire. Attached to it were\nvarious gauges, with dials showing red and black numbers.\n\n\"This is perhaps our greatest achievement, swine,\" remarked Von\nKettler, affably. \"You shall see its operations from above.\" He\npointed to a narrow spiral staircase rising at the far end of the\nroom. \"It is the practical application of Einstein's gravitation and\nelectricity in field relation. It is by means of this, and the three\ndynamos on the ground that we were able to neutralize your engines\nlast night and bring them down where we wanted them. You must be sure\nto tell the Washington hogs about that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe motioned to Dick to cross the room and ascend the spiral staircase.\nFollowing him, he flung another switch similar to the first one, and\ninstantly all sound within the room was cut off.\n\nThey ascended the winding flight and emerged upon a floor or platform.\nDick felt it under his feet, but he could see nothing except the\nground, far beneath him. He seemed to be suspended in the void. He\nstopped, groping, hesitating to advance. Von Kettler's jarring laugh\ngrated on his ears.\n\n\"Don't be afraid, swine,\" he jeered. \"This place is enclosed. There is\na shadow-breaking device on every floor, which renders us complete\nmasters of camouflage.\"\n\nA switch snapped. Dick found himself instantly in a rotunda, roofed\nwith glass, sections of which were raised to a height of three or four\nfeet from the wooden base, admitting a gentle breeze. Three or four\nmen were moving about in it, but these wore the black uniform with the\nsilver braid, and Von Kettler's manner was deferential as he addressed\nthem, jerking his hand contemptuously toward Dick. Grins of derision\nand malice appeared on all the faces.\n\nSave one, an elderly officer, apparently of high rank, who came\nforward and raised his hand to the salute.\n\n\"Captain Rennell,\" he said, \"we are at war with your nation, but we\nare also, I hope, gentlemen.\" He turned to Von Kettler. \"Is it\nseemly,\" he asked, \"that an officer of the American army should be\nbrought here in chains and cords?\"\n\n\"Excellency, it is His Majesty's command,\" responded Von Kettler, with\na servile smirk that hardly concealed his elation. \"Moreover, the\nAmerican is to witness the forthcoming destruction of the Yankee\nfleet.\"\n\nThe elderly officer reddened, turned away without replying. Dick\nlooked about him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was less machinery in this room. The iron pillar that he had\nseen came through the floor and terminated some five feet above it in\nanother of the opaque glass domes, filled with iridescent fire. About\nit was a complicated arrangement of dials and gauges.\n\nIn the centre of the room was a sort of camera obscura. A large hood\nprojected above a flat table, and an officer was half-concealed\nbeneath it, apparently studying the table busily.\n\n\"Come, American, you shall see your navy on its way to destruction,\"\nsaid Von Kettler, beckoning Dick within the hood.\n\nThe officer stepped from the table, whose top was a sheet of silvered\nglass, leaving Von Kettler and Dick in front of it. Dick looked. At\nfirst he could see nothing but the vast stretch of sea; then he began\nto make out tiny dots at the table's end, terminating in minute blurs\nthat were evidently smoke from the funnels.\n\n\"Your ships,\" said Von Kettler, smiling. \"This is the dirigible.\" He\npointed to another dot that came into sight and disappeared almost\ninstantly. \"They are a hundred and fifty miles away. Explain to your\nfriends in Washington that our super-telescopic sights are based upon\na refraction of light that overcomes the earth's curvature. It is\nsimple, but it happens not to have been worked out until my Master\ncommanded it.\"\n\nDick watched those tiny dots in fascination, mentally computing. At an\naverage speed of fifty knots an hour, the squadron's steaming rate,\nthey should be off the coast within three hours. The dirigible would\ntake two, if it went ahead to scout, as was almost certain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDick stepped back from beneath the hood and glanced about him. If only\nhis arms were not bound, he might do enough damage within a few\nseconds to put the deadlier machinery out of commission, if only the\nsilvered mirror. He glanced about him. Von Kettler, interpreting his\nthought, smiled coolly.\n\n\"You are helpless, my dear Yankee pig,\" he said. \"But there is more\nto see. Oblige me by accompanying me up to the top story.\"\n\nHe pointed to a ladder running up beside the iron pillar through an\nopening in the roof, and Dick, with a shrug of the shoulders,\ncomplied. He emerged upon a small platform, apparently protruding into\nvacancy. Far underneath he saw the clearing, and two airplanes on the\ntarmac, the aviators looking like beetles from that height. He looked\nout to sea and saw no signs of the fleet.\n\n\"You have heard of St. Simeon Stylites, Yankee?\" purred Von Kettler.\n\"The gentleman who spent forty years of his life upon a tall pillar,\nin atonement for his sins? It is His Majesty's desire that you spend,\nnot forty years, but two or three hours up here, meditating upon his\ngrandeur, before returning to earth. It is also possible that you will\nwitness something of considerable interest. Look out to sea!\"\n\nDick turned his head involuntarily. He heard Von Kettler's laugh,\nheard the snap of a switch--then suddenly he was alone in the void.\n\nAt that snap of the switch, everything had vanished from view behind\nhim, the building, even the platform on which he stood. His feet\nseemed to rest on nothing. Yet below him he could still see the\nairplanes, and more being wheeled out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA sense of extreme physical nausea overcame him. He reeled, then\nmanaged to steady himself. He, too, was invisible to his own eyes.\nInvoluntarily he cried out. No sound came from his lips. He stood\nthere, invisible in an invisible, soundless void.\n\nFor what seemed an unending period he occupied himself with\nendeavoring to obtain the sense of balance. Then, with a great effort,\nhe managed to loosen the cords that bound his right arm to his side. A\nmighty wrench, and he had slipped them up above his elbow. His right\nlower arm was free.\n\nHe extended it cautiously, and his hand encountered a railing.\nInstantly he felt more at ease. He began moving slowly around in a\nwidening circle, and discovered that the platform was enclosed. The\nfurther side was, however, open, and he began sliding forward, foot by\nfoot, to locate himself. Once his foot slipped over the edge, and he\ndrew back hastily. He felt on the other side, and discovered that he\nwas upon what seemed a plank walk, perhaps a hundred and fifty feet\nabove the ground, with no rail on either side, and some six feet wide.\n\nVery cautiously he shuffled his way along it. It was solid enough,\nalthough invisible, but more than once Dick walked perilously close to\none edge or the other. At length he went down on his hands and knees,\nand proceeded, crawling, until his movements were arrested by what was\nunmistakably a door.\n\nThe plank bridge, then, connected the top stories of two buildings,\nbut what the second was, there was no means of knowing. The door was\nbarred on the other side, and did not yield an iota to Dick's cautious\npressure. Dick felt the frame. Beyond was glass, reinforced with iron\non the outside, the latter metal forming a sort of lattice work.\nCautiously Dick began to crawl up the rounded dome.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFoot by foot he made his way, clinging to the iron bars, until he felt\nthat he had reached the point of the dome's maximum convexity. He\nwedged his feet against a bar and rested. Only now was it brought home\nto him that it would be impossible for him to find his way back to the\nplank.\n\nA long time must have passed, for, looking out to sea, he could see\nthe squadron now, minute points on the horizon, exuding smudges of\nsmoke. The dirigible was still invisible. The airplanes had either\nleft the tarmac or had been wrapped in the gas-impregnated cloth, for\nboth they and the aviators had vanished.\n\nSuddenly Dick had an odd sensation that the iron was growing warm.\n\nIn another moment or two he had no doubt of it. The iron bar he\nclutched was distinctly warm; it was growing hot. He shifted his grasp\nto the adjacent bar and even in that moment the heat had increased\nperceptibly.\n\nSuddenly there came a vibration, a sense of movement. Dick was being\nswung outward. The whole dome seemed to be dropping into space. He dug\nhis feet and fingers under the hot rods, and felt himself sliding over\non his back.\n\nBack--back, till he was lying horizontally in space, and clutching\ndesperately at the iron bar, which was growing hotter every moment.\n\nThe sliding movement ceased. It was as if the whole upper section of\nthe glass dome had opened outward. But the heat of the bars was\nbecoming unbearable, and gusts of hot air seemed to be proceeding from\nwithin.\n\nHot or not, Dick's only alternative was to work his way back to the\nstable portion of the dome, or to frizzle until he dropped through\nspace.\n\nClinging desperately to the bars, he began working back, reaching from\nbar to bar with his right hand and dragging his feet, with the\nclanking chain attached, from bar to bar also.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHow he gained the base of the dome he was never able afterward to\nunderstand. The heat had grown intolerable; his hands were blistering.\nSomehow he reached it. He rested a moment despite the heat. But to\nfind the plank walk was clearly impossible. In another minute he must\ndrop. Better that than to fry there like St. Lawrence on his griddle.\n\nAnd then, just when he had resigned himself to that last drop, there\ncame an unexpected diversion. Almost beside him a window was hung\nback. A man looked out. Dick saw one of the workmen in the blue\nblouses, and, behind him, within the dome, what seemed like an empty\nroom.\n\nDick was slightly above the man. As his head and shoulders appeared,\nhe let himself go, landing squarely across his back. He slid down his\nshoulders through the open window into the interior of the dome.\n\nThe man, flung against the frame of the window by the shock, uttered a\npiercing cry. Before he could recover his stand, or take in what had\nhappened to him, Dick had gained his feet and leaped upon him. His\nright hand closed upon his throat. He bore him to the floor and choked\nhim into insensibility.\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n_In the Laboratory_\n\nNot until the man's struggles had ceased, and he lay unconscious,\npanting, and blue in the face, did Dick release him. Then he looked\nabout him.\n\nSave for the workman, he was alone in a rotunda, open to the sky, and,\nas he had supposed, the whole upper portion of the dome had been flung\nback, leaving an immense aperture into which the sun was shining,\nflecking the interior with shafts of light. The temperature, despite\nthe opening of the dome, must have been in excess of a hundred and\ntwenty-five degrees.\n\nThere was nothing except an immense central shaft, up which ran a\nhollow pole of glass, cut off by the invisible paint at the summit of\nthe dome. The inside of this glass pole was glowing with colored\nfires, and it was from this that the intolerable heat came, though its\nfunction Dick could not imagine.\n\nOne thing was clear: It was growing hotter each moment. To remain in\nthat rotunda meant death within a brief period of time.\n\n_And there was no way out!_ Dick glared around him, searching the\nglass walls in vain. No semblance of a stairway or ladder, even. Yet\nthe workman must have entered by some ingress--if only Dick could\ndiscover it!\n\nHe began running round the interior of the dome in the brilliant\nsunshine, searching frantically for that ingress. And it was growing\nhotter! The sweat was pouring down his face beneath the invisible\ngarment.\n\nDick was vaguely aware that the silence switch had been thrown in the\nroom, for his feet made no sound, but the knowledge was latent in his\nmind. Two or three times he circumnavigated the interior of the dome,\nlike a rat in a trap.\n\nThen suddenly he saw a section of the flooring rise in a corner, and a\nworkman in a blue blouse appear out of the trap door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stood there, his face muscles working as he shouted for his\ncompanion, but no sound came from his lips. He looked about him, and\nsaw the unconscious man beside the window. He started in his\ndirection.\n\nWith a shout, Dick hurled himself toward him. And he checked himself\neven as he was about to leap. For he realized that the second workman\nneither saw nor heard him.\n\nYet some subconscious impression of danger must have reached his mind,\nfor the workman stopped too, instinctively assuming an attitude of\ndefense. Dick gathered a dozen links of his wrist-chain in his right\nhand, leaped and struck.\n\nThe workman crumpled to the floor, a little thread of blood creeping\nfrom his right temple.\n\nIt was the thing upon which Dick looked back afterward with less\nsatisfaction than any other, leaving the two unconscious men in that\nroom of death. Yet there was nothing else he could have done. He ran\nto the trap, and saw a ladder leading down. In a moment he had swung\nhimself through and closed the trap behind him.\n\nThe material that lined the walls below must have had almost perfect\ninsulating qualities, for the temperature here was no hotter than in\nthe Bahamas on a hot summer day. Dick scrambled down the ladder and\nfound himself in a machine-shop. Nobody was there, and tools of all\nsorts were lying about, as well as machinery whose purpose he did not\nunderstand. A pair of heavy pliers and a vise were sufficient to rid\nDick of his wrist and ankle chains in a minute or two. With a knife he\nslashed the cords of invisible stuff that bound him. He stood up,\ncramped, but free.\n\nHe picked up an iron bar that was lying loose on a table beside a\nmachine, and advanced to the staircase in one corner of the shop. As\nhe approached it, another workman came running up.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDick stood aside in an embrasure in the wall partly occupied by a\nmachine. The man passed within two feet of him and never saw him. Only\nthen did Dick quite realize that he was actually invisible.\n\nThe moment the man had passed him, Dick ran to the staircase. He\ndescended one flight; he was half way down another when a yell of pain\nand imprecation came to his ears. He knew that voice: it was Luke\nEvans's!\n\nWith three bounds Dick reached the bottom of the stairs. He saw a\nlarge room in front of him. No mistaking the nature of this room; it\nwas an ordinary laboratory, fitted out with the greatest elaboration,\nand divided into two parts by paneling. And sight and sound were on.\n\nIn the part nearer Dick three men were grouped about a large dynamo,\nwhich was sending out a high, musical note as it spun. Levers and\ndials were all about it, and above it was the base of the glass tube\nthat Dick had seen above. In the other part were five or six men.\nThree of them were testing some substance at a table; three more were\ngathered about old Luke Evans, whose silver chains had been removed\nand replaced by ropes, which bound his limbs, and also bound him to a\nheavy chair, which seemed to be affixed to the ground. One of the\nthree had a piece of metal in a pair of long-handled pliers. It was\nwhite hot, and a white electric spark that shot to and fro between two\nterminals close by, showed where it had been heated.\n\nDick started; he recognized one of the three men as Von Kettler. He\nmoved slowly forward, very softly, his feet making no sound on the\nfiber matting that covered the floor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Did that feel good, American swine?\" asked Von Kettler softly, and\nDick saw, with horror, a red weal on the old man's forehead. \"Now you\nare perhaps in a more gracious mood, Professor? The unknown isotope in\nthat black gas of yours--you are disposed to give us the chemical\nformula?\"\n\n\"I'll see you in hell first,\" raved old Luke Evans, writhing in his\nchair.\n\nVon Kettler turned to the man holding the white-hot metal, and nodded.\nBut at that moment a door behind Evans's chair opened, and Fredegonde\nValmy appeared in the entrance. Von Kettler turned hastily, snatched\nthe pliers from the man's hand, and laid the metal in a receptacle.\n\nBut the girl had seen the action. She looked at the weal on Luke's\nforehead, and clenched her hands; her eyes dilated with horror.\n\n\"You have been torturing him, Hugo!\" she cried.\n\n\"Freda, what are you doing in here? Oblige me by withdrawing\nimmediately!\" cried Von Kettler.\n\n\"Where is Captain Rennell?\" the girl retorted. \"I will know!\"\n\n\"He is upstairs, watching the approaching Yankee fleet, and waiting to\nsee its destruction,\" returned the other.\n\n\"You are lying to me! He has been killed, and this old man has been\ntortured!\" cried Fredegonde. \"I tell you, Hugo Von Kettler, you are no\nlonger a half-brother of mine! I am through with you!\"\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" sneered Von Kettler, \"it is not possible to dispose\nof a family relationship so easily.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It is cheap to sneer,\" the girl retorted. \"But you sang a very\ndifferent song when you were in the penitentiary, in terror of death,\nand you begged me to come and throw you the invisible robe through the\nbars. You promised me then that you would abandon this mad enterprise\nand come away with me. You swore it!\"\n\n\"I have sworn allegiance to my Emperor, and that comes first,\"\nretorted Von Kettler. \"Oblige me by retiring.\"\n\n\"I shall do nothing of the sort,\" cried the girl hysterically. \"When\nyou used me as a tool in your enterprises in Washington, you played\nupon my patriotism for my conquered country. I thought I was\nundertaking a heroic act. I didn't dream of the villainy, the\ncold-blooded murder that was to be wrought.\n\n\"You've kept me here virtually a prisoner,\" she went on, with rising\nviolence, \"an attendant upon that old madman, your Emperor, and his\nsham court, while more murder is being planned. Where is Captain\nRennell, I say?\" She stamped her foot. \"I demand that he and this old\nman be set at liberty at once. Hugo,\" she pleaded, \"come away with me.\nDon't you see what the end must be? This is no heroic enterprise, it\nis wholesale murder that will arouse the conscience of civilized\nmankind against you! Order that the vortex-ray be turned off,\" she\nwent on, looking through the opening in the partition toward the\ndynamo. \"That gas--you cannot be so vile as to send it forth again, to\ndestroy the American ships?\"\n\n\"My dear Freda,\" retorted the young man coolly, \"the vortex-ray is\nalready charged with the gas, and at a height of twenty thousand feet\nit is now creating a vacuum that will send the gas upon the wings of a\nhurricane straight up the Atlantic seaboard. It will obliterate every\nliving thing on board the battleships, from men to rats, and this time\nwe mean to reach New York.\n\n\"As for that swine Rennell,\" he went on, \"you heard His Majesty\nannounce his intention of sending him back to Washington with the\ninformation of our irresistible power. Of course I know you are in\nlove with him, and that these qualms of conscience are due to that\ncircumstance.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Dick hardly heard the latter part of Von Kettler's remarks.\nSuddenly the significance of the dynamo and the superheated room above\nhad come home to him. He had read of such a project years before, in\nsome newspaper, and had forgotten about it until that moment.\n\nBy sending a high-tension current almost to the limits of the earth's\natmosphere, the article had said, a vortex or vacuum could be set up\nwhich would create a hurricane.\n\nThe tremendous pressure of the in-rushing air would make a veritable\ncyclone, which, taking the course of the prevailing winds, would rush\nforth on a mission of widespread disaster.\n\nAnd on this hurricane would go the deadly gas, infinitely diluted, and\nyet deadly to all life in its infinitesimal proportion to the\natmosphere.\n\nAnd the American fleet was now approaching the Bahama shores.\n\nDick forgot Luke Evans, everything else, as the significance of that\nmechanism in the next room came home to him. He ran like a madman\nthrough the space in the partition, and, raising the bar aloft,\nbrought it thudding down upon the dials, twisting and warping them.\n\nHe struck at the hollow pole, but, glass or not, it defied all his\nefforts. He seized a heavy lever and flung it into reverse--and two\nothers.\n\nYelling, the three attendants broke and ran. Out of the laboratory the\nsix came running, collided with the three. Behind them Dick could see\nFredegonde Valmy, a knife in her hand, slashing at Luke Evans's bonds.\n\nDick swung his bar and brought it crashing down on a head, felling the\nman like a log. He saw Von Kettler pull one of the glass rods from\nhis pocket and fire blindly. The discharge struck a second attendant,\nand the man dropped screeching, his clothes ablaze.\n\nSomebody yelled, \"He's there! Look at his eyes!\" and pointed at Dick's\nface.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDick leaped aside and swung the rod again, felling a third man. The\nothers turned and ran. Von Kettler in the van, broke through the door\nbehind Luke Evans's chair, and disappeared.\n\nDick ran back to where the old man was standing beside the girl, the\ndiscarded ropes at his feet. He flung his hood back. \"Luke, don't you\nknow me?\" he shouted.\n\nIt was creditable to Luke Evans's composure that, though Dick must\nhave presented the aspect of nothing more than a face floating in the\nair, he retained his composure.\n\n\"Sure I know you, Rennell,\" replied the old man. \"And you and me's\ngoing to best them devils yet.\"\n\n\"But the fleet--it's approaching Abaco,\" Dick cried. \"I've got to warn\nthem.\"\n\nFredegonde seized him by the arm.\n\n\"Come with me,\" she cried. \"If they find you here, they'll kill you.\"\n\nDick hesitated only a moment, then followed the girl as she dashed for\nanother door on the same side of the laboratory as that by which Von\nKettler and his men had fled. They dashed down the staircase, and a\ncorridor disclosed itself at the bottom. The girl stopped.\n\n\"There is a private way--the Emperor's,\" she panted. \"He had it\nconstructed--in case of necessity. I got the keys. I was\nplanning--something desperate--to stop these murders; I didn't know\nwhat.\"\n\nDick seized her by the arm. \"What keys?\" he demanded. \"The key to the\nplace where President Hargreaves is?\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"We must get him. Where is he?\"\n\n\"In a cell beneath the throne room. That's overhead. But they'll\ncatch us--\"\n\n\"Which is the key?\" asked Dick.\n\nThe girl produced three or four keys, fumbled with them, handed one to\nDick. \"This way!\" she cried.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey ran along the corridor. Two guards appeared, moving toward them\nunder the electric lights. At the sight of the girl running, and Luke\nEvans, they stopped in surprise.\n\nDick had pulled the hood back over his head. He ran toward them,\nwielding the iron bar. A mighty swing sent the two toppling over, one\nunconscious, the other bruised and yelling loudly.\n\n\"Here! Here!\" gasped Fredegonde, stopping before a door.\n\nDick fitted the key to the lock and turned it. Inside, upon a quite\nvisible bed, sat President Hargreaves, unchained. He looked up\ninquiringly as the three entered.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" said Dick, throwing back his hood, \"I'm an American\nofficer, and I want to save you. There's not much chance, but, if\nyou'll come with me--\"\n\nHargreaves got up and smiled. \"I'm not a military man, sir,\" he\nanswered, \"but I'm ready to take that chance rather than--\"\n\nHe did not complete the sentence. Shouts echoed along the corridor\nbehind them. Dick replaced his hood, handed the keys back to the girl.\n\"Take Mr. Hargreaves to any place of temporary safety you can,\" he\nsaid. \"And Mr. Evans. I'll hold them!\"\n\n\"It's right here. This door!\" panted the girl, indicating a door at\nthe end of the passage.\n\nThe three ran toward it. Dick turned. Five or six guards with Von\nKettler at their head, were running toward him. They saw the three\nfugitives and set up a shout.\n\nDick had a quick inspiration. He dashed back into the cell, seized the\nlight bed, and dragged it through the doorway into the passage, just\nin time to send Von Kettler and two others sprawling. He brought down\nthe bar upon the head of one of them, shouting as he did so.\n\nThen he became aware that the passage was flooded with sunshine.\nFredegonde had got the door open.\n\nHe darted back, passed through in the wake of the three, and slammed\nit shut. Fredegonde turned the key. Instantly Dick found himself with\nhis three companions upon the prairie. Not a vestige of the buildings\nwas apparent anywhere, except for the patches of brown earth.\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n_Von Kettler's End_\n\nFredegonde took command, repressing her agitation with a visible\neffort. \"They cannot break down that door,\" she said, \"and they dare\nnot ask for another key. It will take them a minute or two to go back\nand reach us around the building. But there may be a score of people\nwatching us. Let us walk quietly toward the thickets. If I am present,\nthey will not suspect anything is wrong.\"\n\nBut Dick stood still, driven into absolute immobility by the\nconflicting claims of duty. For overhead, high in the blue, was an\nAmerican dirigible.\n\nAnd at his side was the President of the United States. One or other\nof them he must sacrifice.\n\nHe chose. He ran forward without answering. Those squares of brown\nearth, set side by side, were the airplane hangars, and he meant to\nseize an airplane, if he could find one beneath its coat of\ninvisibility, and fly to warn the dirigible and the fleet.\n\nA curious wind was blowing. It seemed to come swirling downward, as no\nwind that Dick had ever known. It was growing in violence each moment,\nbeating upon his face.\n\nAs he ran, he was aware of Luke beside him. He heard shouting all\nabout them. Luke had been seen. Not only Luke, but Hargreaves, who was\nrunning after Luke, with Fredegonde trying in vain to change his\nintentions. At the edge of the first brown patch Dick collided\nviolently with the wall of the invisible hangar, and went reeling\nback. The shouts were growing louder.\n\n\"Wait!\" gasped Luke Evans. He had something like a large watch in his\nhand. He held it out like a pistol, and from it projected a beam of\nthe black gas.\n\nThen Dick remembered Colonel Stopford's words: \"He showed me a watch\nand said the salvation of the world was inside the case. I thought him\ninsane.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInsane or not, old Luke Evans had concealed the tiny model of the\ncamera-box to good purpose. As he swept the black beam around him, the\nwhole mass of buildings sprang into luminosity, the figures of a score\nof men, grouped together, and advancing in a threatening mass, some\ndistance away--and more.\n\nTwo airplanes, standing side by side upon the tarmac, just in front of\nthe hangar--not mere pursuit planes, but six-seaters, formidably\narmed, with central turrets and bow and rear guns, and propellers\nrevolving.\n\nTwo mechanics stood staring in the direction of the little group.\n\n\"I'm with you,\" gasped Hargreaves. \"I'm not a military man, but I've\ngot fighting blood, and I come of a fighting race.\"\n\nDick leaped and once more swung the iron bar. The nearer of the two\nmechanics went down like lead, the second, seeing his companion\nbludgeoned out of the air, turned and ran.\n\nDick shouted, pointing. Fredegonde jumped into the plane, and the\nPresident scrambled in behind her. The group, dismayed by the black\nbeam, which Luke Evans was now turning steadily upon them, had halted\nirresolutely. But suddenly a head appeared, moving swiftly through the\nair toward the plane. It was Von Kettler, with hood flung back, the\nface distorted with rage and fury.\n\nAt his yells, the whole crowd started forward. Dick leaped into the\ncentral cockpit, swung the helicopter lever. Something spitted past\nhis face, and a long streak appeared on the turret, where the\ngas-paint had been scored. But he was rising, rising into that\nincreasing wind....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe heard a yell of triumph behind him. And that yell of Von Kettler's\nwas his undoing. There is the telepathy between close friends, but\nthere is also telepathic sympathy between enemies, and in an instant\nDick understood what that shout of triumph portended.\n\nHe was rising into the line of magnetic force that would anchor his\nairplane helplessly, and leave it to be jerked down and held at Von\nKettler's mercy.\n\nHe released the helicopter lever and opened throttle wide. For an\ninstant the heavy plane hung dangerously at its low elevation,\nthreatening to nose over. Then Dick regained control, and was winging\naway toward the sea, while yells of baffled fury from behind indicated\nthe chagrin of his enemies.\n\nHe glanced up. Thank heaven the dirigible had not approached the trap.\nIt was apparently circling overhead. Of course the observers had seen\nnothing, had no conception that the headquarters of the Invisible\nEmpire lay below.\n\nAnd yet it seemed to be drifting aimlessly back toward the\nfleet--erratically, as if not under complete control. And Dick could\nsee the ships about a mile offshore, apparently drifting too. They\nwere moving as no American squadron ever moved since the day the first\nhull was launched, for some of them, turned bow inward toward others,\nseemed upon the point of collision, while others were lagging on the\nedge of the formation, as if pointing for home.\n\nThen suddenly the awful truth dawned upon Dick. The occupants of\nships and dirigible alike had been overcome by the deadly gas.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDick banked, turned, leaned forward and shouted to Luke Evans, and,\nwhen the old man turned his head, indicated to him to sweep the tarmac\nwith his ray.\n\nThe thread of black, broadening into a truncated cone, revealed\nnothing save the luminous outlines of the buildings. Apparently the\ntarmac was deserted. It was queer, too, that the silence of the night\nbefore was gone. Dick shouted again, to assure himself of what he knew\nalready, and heard his own voice again.\n\nSomething had happened, something unexpected----or perhaps the crew of\nthe Invisible Emperor, satisfied with the effects of the deadly gas,\nhad not thought it necessary to go to any further trouble.\n\nSuddenly Dick discovered that he was almost within the circle of the\nline of magnetic force. Hurriedly he threw over the stick and kicked\nrudder. It was not till he was again approaching the seashore that it\noccurred to him that the force, too, was not in operation.\n\nHe opened throttle wide and shot seaward. He must ascertain what had\nhappened, and, if not too late, give warning without delay.\n\nThen suddenly the vicious rattle of gunfire sounded in Dick's ears,\nand, materializing out of the sky, came Von Kettler's face. Startled\nfor an instant, Dick quickly realized that it was Von Kettler in his\nplane, with his hood thrown back.\n\nAnd Dick realized that his own hood was thrown back. Two faces and\nnothing else, were the whole visible setting for battle.\n\nBut that look upon Von Kettler's face was even more demoniacal than\nbefore. Mad with rage at the prospective escape of his prey, and\ninfuriated by his half-sister's appearance in the plane, Von Kettler\nhad thrown all caution to the winds. In his insane hatred he was\nprepared to shoot down Dick's plane and send Fredegonde to destruction\nwith it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIf Dick chose to replace his hood he would have the madman at his\nmercy. And, if he had thought about it, he would have done so, with\nFredegonde sitting behind him. But the idea did not enter his mind.\nConsumed with rage almost equal to Von Kettler's, he only saw there\nthe face of one of those who had inflicted an unspeakable outrage upon\nthe President of his country.\n\nThe memory of old Hargreaves, chained before the mock-Emperor's\nthrone, enraged Dick more than the holocaust of lives taken by the\nassassins.\n\nHe shouted a wild answer to Von Kettler's challenge as his plane sped\nby, and banked. At that moment there came a roaring concussion that\nshook the plane from prop to tail.\n\nDick turned his head. Somehow, President Hargreaves had contrived to\nget the rear gun into action, and now he was staring at it as if he\ncould not believe that he had fired it.\n\nAnd that action heartened Dick wonderfully. As Von Kettler's face\nappeared again, he loosed his turret gun in a sweeping blast, and\nheard Von Kettler's gun roar futilely.\n\nAgain they crossed each other's path, and again and again, two faces,\nonly able to gauge roughly the position of their planes. Neither man\nhad succeeded in injuring the other.\n\nOnce old Lake turned his black ray upon Von Kettler, and for, a moment\nthe plane stood out luminously in the blackness, but Dick leaned\nforward and yelled to the old man to desist.\n\nAnd once Dick looked back and saw Fredegonde crouched in her cockpit\nwith eyes wide with terror. And yet he read in her eyes the same\ndetermination she had expressed in the laboratory. She was through\nwith her half-brother.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll this while the wind had been increasing, making it difficult to\nmaneuver the heavy plane; but now, of a sudden there came a dead lull,\nand then, with a whining sound, the wind rushed in again.\n\nBut this was a wind still more unlike any that Dick had ever known. A\nmighty gale that revolved circularly, but downward too, like a vortex,\ncatching the plane and sweeping it into an ever tightening circle.\n\nA man-made gale, upon whose wings the poison gas would spread\nnorthward again, carrying unlimited destruction with it. Dick fought\nin vain to free himself.\n\nHe was revolving as in a whirlpool, and it required the utmost\npresence of mind and watchfulness to hold the plane steady. Round and\nround he spun--and then, suddenly, out of the void materialized Von\nKettler's face.\n\nVon Kettler, helpless too, was spinning round upon the opposite side\nof the vortex. Thus each airship was upon the tail of the other, and\nit was a matter of chance which would get the other within the\nringsights of the turret gun.\n\nVon Kettler was so near that his shouts of fury came fitfully to\nDick's ears as the wind carried them. Dick, working the controls, knew\nthat not for an instant could he direct his attention from them in\norder to fire his gun, and the moment Von Kettler attempted to do so,\nhe was doomed.\n\nRound and round, struggling, battling in vain--and once more the\nconcussion of the rear gun shook the plane. And a shout from the\nPresident reached Dick's ears.\n\nDick turned his head for an instant, long enough to see Von Kettler\nspinning down through the vortex. And he was going down afire.\nPresident Hargreaves, \"no military man,\" had got him, the second time\nhe had ever aligned a gun-barrel upon a target.\n\n\"Bravo, sir, bravo!\" Dick shouted.\n\nAnd desperately he flung the stick forward and nosed down.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo gale, man-made or heaven-made, could carry on its wings\nthree-quarters of a ton of armored, turreted airship. Swirling like a\nleaf, the plane broke through the clutch of the blast. Instantly it\ngrew calm. Outside that vortex, hardly a breath of air was stirring.\nIt was as if the whole fury of the air was concentrated within that\ncircle.\n\nThe ground came rushing up. Once more Dick tried to head seaward. With\nflying speed lost, he was calculating the exact moment in his downward\nrush when he could hope to resume control. Would that moment come\nbefore he crashed?\n\nAt less than a hundred feet he partly regained control. For a moment\nthe plane seemed to fly on an even keel. Then her nose went down as\nher speed slackened. And this time there was no salvation.\n\nWorking desperately to save her, Dick saw the ground loom up before\nhim. He heard the crash as the plane broke into splintering ruin ...\nhe had a last vision of old Luke clutching his precious watch: then\neverything was dissolved in darkness....\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n_You Can't Down the Marines_\n\n\"He's pulling out of it! Keep it up, Gotch!\"\n\nDick heard the words and opened his eyes. He stared in amazement at\nthe faces about him. Honest American faces under tropical helmets and\nabove a uniform that he had never expected to see again. It couldn't\nbe real. And yet it was. One word broke from his lips:\n\n\"Marines!\"\n\n\"He's got it. Don't let him slip, Gotch.\", grinned one of the friendly\nfaces, and the man named Gotch, who presumably had some qualifications\nfor his job, continued what was meant to be a gentle massage of the\nnerve centers along Dick's spine.\n\n\"I'm all right.\" Dick muttered, beginning to realize his\nsurroundings. He was lying on a strip of prairie near the beach, on\nwhich the waves were breaking in low ripples about a motorboat that\nwas drawn up.\n\nHe sat up. The world was swimming about him, but he seemed to have no\nbroken bones. Not far away was the wrecked plane, an incongruous mass\nof streaks where the fabric had ripped through the gas-paint. \"Where\nare the others?\" Dick muttered.\n\nThen he was aware of Fredegonde Valmy lying with a white face under a\nshrub. Her eyes were open, and turned toward him.\n\nHe heard Luke Evans's voice. The old man hobbled round from Dick's\nback, one arm in a bandage.\n\n\"She's hurt rather bad, Rennell, but we won't know how bad till we can\nget her away,\" he said. \"You've been lying here about an hour, since\nwe crashed. President Hargreaves made them take him to the fleet in\nthe other motorboat to see what he could do. He's assumed command.\n\n\"You see, Rennell, that damn gas caught the fleet and put pretty near\nevery man out of commission for good. But these fellows wasn't going\nto give up. So, since all their officers were gone, they took two of\nthe boats and their arms and equipment, and came ashore to settle\naccounts. And they won't believe there's anybody on the island or any\nbuildings. And I can't make 'em believe it. God, Rennell, those\ninvisible devils may attack us at any moment. I don't understand what\nthey're waiting for.\"\n\nGotch spoke: \"We know you're Captain Rennell, sir. And this gentleman,\nwe know him too, but he seems a bit queer in his head. Talking of the\nInvisible Emperor's headquarters on this island, a mile or so inland.\nThe only invisible thing we've found is that piece of a garment we\npulled off you.\"\n\n\"I broke my watch ray machine in the fall, and I can't make them\nbelieve, Rennell,\" almost wept old Evans. \"Tell them I'm not crazy.\"\n\nDick got upon his feet with an effort, staggered a little, then made\nhis way to Fredegonde. He kneeled down beside the girl. She was\nconscious, and smiled faintly, but she could not speak. He pressed her\nhand, rose, and came back. \"Mr. Evans is not crazy,\" he said. \"The\nheadquarters of the gang is over there.\" He pointed. \"Didn't President\nHargreaves tell you?\"\n\n\"He was kind of incoherent, sir.\" The marines looked at one another,\nwondering. Was Captain Rennell crazy too?\n\n\"We've had scouts out through the jungle, sir. There's nothing within\nfive miles of here. They had a clear view through to the sea from the\ntop of a hill.\"\n\n\"I've been there.\" Dick spoke with conviction. \"I must tell you\nthey've got devices that make them practically irresistible. That gas\nand other things. And they're invisible. But if you boys are willing\nto follow me, I'll lead you. It means death. I don't know what they're\nwaiting for. But--are you willing to follow me?\"\n\n\"We'll follow you, sir\"--after a pause, during which Dick read in\ntheir eyes the desire to humor a crazy man. \"We'll follow to hell,\nsir--if that gang's really there.\"\n\n\"Take your arms, then!\" Dick pointed to the stacked rifles.\n\nA minute later the twenty-odd Marines, forming an open line that\nextended from one side of the clearing to the other, were on their way\ntoward the headquarters of the gang. And Dick, leading them, though\nhis head was reeling, felt as if his own reason was slipping from him.\nHad he only dreamed all this? Was it possible that the headquarters of\nthe Invisible Emperor existed on this desolate prairie? If it was\ntrue, why had they suddenly become silent, inert? Why had they not\nlong ago wiped out these few Marines? And the gale--was it now\nsweeping northward on its mission of destruction?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalf an hour passed. Then the brown patches of the foundations came\ninto view upon the open ground. Here were the hangers, here was the\ncentral building with the Emperor's headquarters. And nothing was\nvisible, nothing stirred, yet at any moment Dick expected the rattle\nof machine-gun bullets or some more terrific method of destruction.\n\n\"Halt!\" The line stood still. \"I am going forward ahead or you. You'll\nfollow at a distance of twenty paces. When you see me stop, feel for\nthe door in the wall, and if I disappear, follow me. You understand?\"\n\nThe Marines assented cheerfully. No harm in humoring this poor devil\nof an officer who had crashed and lost his wits. Like Luke Evans,\nshambling up through the line to Dick's side. Dick advanced. At any\nmoment now the concentrated fire of the Emperor's men should blast\nthem all to smithereens. Nothing happened.\n\nAnd it was no dream, for Dick's outstretched hand encountered the\nexterior wall of the building. He had gauged his way accurately, too,\nfor a step or two brought him to the door. He stepped inside. He was\ninside the private door that led to the Emperor's quarters, through\nwhich he had passed with Fredegonde, Hargreaves, and Luke Evans in\ntheir flight. It had been broken down, contrary to the girl's\npredictions, and the deserted passage within was perfectly visible to\nthem all.\n\nStupefied, the Marines bumped and jostled with each other as they\ncrowded in. If they had been anything but Marines, their own heads\nmight have been turned at the discovery of this sudden materialization\nof a building out of nothingness.\n\nBeing Marines, they only grinned sheepishly, and followed along the\ncorridor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first human being they saw was one of the guards, in a black\ntunic. He was leaning against a wall, and he was a human being no\nlonger. He looked as if he was asleep, but he was stone dead, with a\nplacid look on his face.\n\nTwo more dead guards lay across each other, with smiles on their\nfaces: and there was a workman in a blue blouse who had been in a\ntremendous hurry to get somewhere, from his appearance, and had never\ngot there. He had fallen asleep instead, and never wakened.\n\nDick found a stairway and led the way up. He thought it ran up to the\nlaboratory, but, instead, the room into which he emerged was the\nante-room of the Invisible Emperor's audience hall. Six dead guards\nlay in a heap in front of the curtain, and they had died as\nunconcerned as their fellows, to judge by the pacific expressions on\ntheir faces.\n\nDick passed through into the throne room. The Marines, behind him, for\nthe first time uttered exclamations of awe--of pity.\n\nThe terrific scene that met Dick's eyes would be burned into his brain\ntill his last day.\n\nUpon his throne, head flung back, sat the Invisible Emperor, his\nfeatures set in a sardonic leer of death. And all about him, some\nsitting, some lying, supporting one another, were his court, officers\nin black uniforms with the silver braid, and women in court dress. And\nall were dead too. But they had not known they had died. They had\nfallen asleep--upon the instant that their own volatile gas reached\nthem.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I guess that's the explanation, sir,\" said old Luke Evans. \"Those\ndevils made the whirlwind and charged it with the gas. But when you\nreversed that lever, you reversed the process. Instead of projecting\nthe force outwardly, you made a suction, and every atom of the gas\nthat hadn't travelled beyond the radius came rushing back and filled\nthe building. If we'd entered a half-hour later, we'd have been dead\nones ourselves, but the gas was volatile enough to disperse through\nthe chinks and crannies. Anyway, it's all over now.\"\n\nYes, it was all over, Dick thought, as he sat in his deck chair upon\nthe cruiser that was bearing him northward. The menace to world\ngovernment had been destroyed and with it all who had been behind it.\nThere would be a new order in the world, a new and kindlier\ngovernment. Men would feel closer to one another than in the past.\nHalf the personnel of the fleet had escaped the invisible death, and\nonly one cruiser and the dirigible had been lost in the confusion.\nThere would be a great reception when they put into Charleston.\n\nDick bent over Fredegonde, who was asleep in her chair beside him. The\nship's surgeon had promised recovery for her. She shouldn't suffer for\nher half-voluntary part in the business, Dick said to himself. It was\ngoing to be his task to help her to forget.\n\n[Advertisement: ]\n\n\n\n\nPrisoners on the Electron\n\n_By Robert H. Leitfred_\n\n[Sidenote: Fate throws two young Earthians into desperate conflict\nwith the primeval monsters of an electron's savage jungles.]\n\n[Illustration: _The gaping mouth jerked forward._]\n\n\nThe blood-red glow of a slanting sun bathed the towers of New York's\nserrated skyline, then dropped into a molten sea beyond the winter\nhorizon. Friday, the last day of Jupiter, the thirteenth month of the\nearth's new calendar, had drawn to a close. In a few hours the year of\n1999 would end--at midnight, to be exact.\n\nFar below the towers stretched well lighted canyons teeming with\nhumanity. At an upper level where once the elevated trains had roared\nand rumbled in an antiquated period long past, an orderly mass of\nworkers and shoppers was borne at an incredible speed from lower\nManhattan to towering apartments that stretched northward to\nPeekskill. The northbound traffic was heaviest at this hour and the\nmoving sidewalk bands were jammed to their capacity.\n\nStreet cars, now obsolete, had vanished from the streets under the new\norder of things as had also passenger cars, taxis and trucks. Speed\npredominated. Noise had practically been eliminated. Except for the\ngentle throb of giant motors far underground, the city was cloaked in\nsilence.\n\nAt regular intervals along the four-speed moving bands that formed the\ntransportation of the great metropolis, huge circular shafts of steel\nmounted upward beyond the roofs of the tallest buildings. Within these\nshafts, swift elevators carried passengers who lived in the outlying\ndistricts to the level of the station platforms of the interstate\noperating transport planes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClose to the entrance of one of the steel shafts stood a young man a\nlittle above medium height. His deep-sunken eyes were those of a\ndreamer, a searcher. They were the eyes of a man who had seen strange\nand startling things. At present they were staring into the pulsing\nwave of humanity flowing northward on the endless steel bands beyond\nthe platform.\n\nQuite suddenly they lighted with pleasure as a man and a girl detached\nthemselves from the swift moving river of people and hurried to the\nspot where he stood.\n\n\"Think we were never coming?\" Karl Danzig's eyes were much like those\nof Aaron Carruthers. Just now they sparkled with suppressed\nexcitement.\n\nAaron Carruthers smiled in turn. \"No, Karl. Any man but you. I\ncouldn't imagine you being late.\" He turned his attention to the slim,\ndark haired girl. \"Nanette,\" he murmured, extending his hand, \"I\ndidn't think you'd come.\"\n\nDazzling white teeth caught the glow of the blue-white incandescents\nalong the platform, and became under the bow of her red lips a string\nof priceless pearls.\n\n\"I had to come, Aaron. Karl has done nothing but talk of your amazing\ndiscovery. The experiment fairly frightens me at times especially when\nI recall the sad fate of your friend, the missing Professor Dahlgren.\nI wish you boys would give up the idea--\"\n\n\"Nan, be still,\" broke in Karl, with brotherly rudeness. Turning to\nCarruthers. \"Everything all ready, Aaron?\" he asked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarruthers nodded. \"As far as humanly possible. The element of error\nis always present. I've checked and re-checked my calculations. I've\naugmented the vacuum tubes by installing three super-dimensional\ninverse power tubes.\" He clasped the girl's arm. \"The street is no\nplace to talk. Let's go to the laboratory.\"\n\nThey crossed the moving bands by an overhead bridge and cut down a\nnarrow canyon to the entrance of a crosstown series of bands. They\nstepped onto the first band. The speed was moderate. From there they\nmoved over to the second. Carruthers was in a hurry. He guided the\ngirl and her brother across the third to the fourth band of moving\nsteel.\n\nBuildings slid past them like wraiths in the electric light. They felt\nno winter chill, for the streets and platforms were heated by a\nconstant flow of warm air from slots ingeniously arranged in the band\nof swift moving metal upon which they stood. Within a few minutes they\nhad arrived at their destination. Quickly they reversed their path\nacross the moving bands until they reached the disembarking platform.\nA short distance from the station they came to the entrance of a huge\ntower building.\n\nCarruthers nodded to the doorman and they were admitted into a marble\nhallway. A silent, unattended lift bore them swiftly to the\nseventy-fifth floor. Down a deep carpeted hallway they moved.\nCarruthers touched his door. It opened. He stood to one side as the\nother two entered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNanette cried with delight at the luxurious splendor of the place.\n\"Why, Aaron, I never dreamed the night view could be quite so\ndelightful! I do believe that if the horrid government had not taken\ndown that little Statue of Liberty and substituted the Shaft Triumph\nin its place, that I could easily see her fingers clasping the torch\nshe was reputed to hold.\n\n\"Progress, dear girl,\" shrugged Carruthers, holding out his hands for\nher cape. \"By the way, have you folks eaten?\"\n\n\"Not in a week,\" said Karl.\n\n\"Von Sternberger's food tablets,\" informed the girl.\n\nCarruthers nodded. His deep-set eyes regarded them appraisingly. \"Any\nill effects?\"\n\n\"None whatever,\" spoke Danzig. \"Neither of us have the slightest\ncraving for food.\"\n\n\"Good. Did you bring any with you?\"\n\n\"A whole carton.\"\n\n\"Then I guess we're already to make the experiment. You're sure.\nNanette, that you're not afraid of....\"\n\n\"Don't be silly, Aaron. I haven't grown up with Karl for nothing. He's\nalways used me for the disagreeable end of his crazy experiments. And\nbesides,\" she smiled on both men. \"I have a woman's curiosity for the\nunknown.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Carruthers gravely. From his waistcoat pocket he\ntook a ring of keys and inserted one of them into the lock of an\nimmense steel door. \"Our laboratory,\" he announced, swinging the door\nwide.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNanette's eyes opened wide at the paneled whiteness of the room. Most\nof the far side was taken up with electrical machines, dynamos,\ngenerators and glass enclosed motors of an advanced type. Overhead,\nconcealed lights made the room as light as day. A heavy glass railing\nshielded a square spot in the exact center of the room.\n\n\"What's that for?\" asked the girl.\n\nDanzig and Carruthers both regarded it with troubled eyes. It was\nCarruthers who spoke.\n\n\"That railing marks the spot where Professor Dahlgren stood when the\nrays of our atomic machine struck him.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" breathed the girl, \"that he never moved from that spot\nafter the rays touched his body? What happened?\"\n\nKarl had already divested himself of his coat and was checking the\ncopper cables leading into a strange machine.\n\n\"It was rather curious,\" remarked Carruthers. \"The moment the ray\ntouched him his body began to dwindle. But evidently he suffered no\npain. As a matter of fact his mind remained quite clear.\"\n\n\"How did you know?\"\n\n\"As he dwindled in size,\" continued Carruthers, \"he shouted warningly\nthat the rays had become confused and for us to cut the switch. But\nthe warning came a fraction of a second too late. Even as my fingers\nopened the contact, his body dwindled to a mere speck and disappeared\nentirely from sight.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNanette gazed with staring eyes at the ill-fated spot. Her face had\ngrown steadily paler. \"Oh, Aaron! It's awful! What do you suppose\nhappened?\"\n\nCarruthers eyes glowed strangely. \"I didn't exactly know at the time,\nNanette. I'm not sure that I know even now. But I've got a theory and\nKarl has helped me to build a second machine to flash a restoring ray\non the square spot. What will take place I cannot even conjecture.\"\n\n\"Let's get on with the experiment,\" interrupted Karl. \"Nanette can be\nshown later what she is to do.\"\n\nCarruthers turned to Danzig. \"All right. Karl. Draw up a chair to your\nmachine. And you, Nanette, sit close to this switch. It's off now. To\nturn it on, simply push it forward until the copper plates slide into\neach other. To turn the current off, you pull sharply out. However, we\naren't quite ready.\"\n\nHe shifted his position until he stood before a third machine\nslightly smaller than the other two. His fingers clicked a switch. The\ndial of the instrument glowed whitely.\n\n\"It's important,\" continued Carruthers, \"that we first locate our\ninterference. We have here, Nanette, a common television receiving\napparatus capable of picking up news and pictures from any corner of\nthe globe. Ready, Karl?\"\n\nDanzig clicked on the switch before his own machine and turned one of\nthe many dials mounted on the panel in front of him. A faint hum\nfilled the room as the generator settled to its task.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarruthers reached up and dimmed the overhead lights. A screen of what\nlooked like frosted glass set in the wall glowed luminously. The\ninterior of a famous broadcasting studio became mirrored in the glass\nscreen. Into it stepped the master of ceremonies. He spoke briefly of\nthe New Year's activities that would soon take place when the\ntwenty-eighth day of Jupiter ended at midnight.\n\n\"Boston,\" said Carruthers. \"Too near.\"\n\n\"Try Frisco,\" suggested Karl. \"The tubes ought to be sufficiently\nheated by this time.\"\n\nThe dial whirled beneath Carruthers slender fingers. The pictures\nframed in the frosted panel faded. Another took its place. San\nFrancisco--an afternoon concert. Carruthers saw and listened for a\nmoment, then moved thousands of miles out to sea.\n\nShanghai drifted into the panel, announcing in sing-song accents the\nweather reports. Following this came reports of various uprisings\nalong the Manchurian border.\n\nWhile yet the three listeners and watchers bent their heads toward the\npanel in the wall, a strange thing occurred. The silver frostiness of\nthe screen became violently agitated with what looked like tiny sparks\ndarting in and about each other like miniature solar systems.\nShanghai faded from the picture. All that remained visible now was the\njumbled mass of needle-pointed sparks of luminosity.\n\n\"Careful,\" warned Carruthers. \"Slow up the speed of your reflector,\nKarl. There, that's better. Watch the meter reading. I'm going to step\nup the power of the dimensional tubes. Steady!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom an invisible reproducer came a sharp, metallic crackling like\nmachine-gun bullets rattling on a tin roof. The sparks on the screen\nbecame violently agitated, pushing around in erratic circles and\nellipses. They glowed constantly in shades of bright green through the\nblues into the deep violets of the color scale.\n\n\"What do you read?\" asked Carruthers.\n\n\"Point seven six nine,\" answered Karl.\n\n\"Shift it back towards the blue, about two points lower on the scale.\"\n\nDanzig twisted two dials at the same time with minute exactness.\n\"Point seven six eleven,\" he intoned.\n\n\"Hold it,\" ordered Carruthers. \"Blue should predominate.\" He turned\nhis eyes on the dancing sparks on the screen. They glowed now a deep\nindigo blue. \"Lock your dials against accidental turning. We're tuned\nto the vanishing point.\"\n\nDanzig rose to his feet. \"What will we use?\"\n\nCarruthers looked hastily around the room. \"Most anything will do.\"\nHis eyes rested on a glass test tube. Quickly he rose to his feet and\nremoved it from the wall rack. Then bending over the glass railing\nthat enclosed the mysterious square he placed it on the floor. He\nturned now to the girl.\n\n\"Quiet, now, Nanette, and don't under any condition leave the chair.\nThe path of the ray should pass within two feet of you, having a wide\nmargin of safety. All right, Karl. Set the dials of the inverse\ndimensional tubes at point seven six eleven, and switch the power to\nthe Roentgen tube.\"\n\nThrough the dimly lighted laboratory came a spurt of bluish flame that\ntwisted and squirmed with slow undulations around the cathode\nelectrode.\n\n\"Fine,\" enthused Carruthers, \"The cathode emanations coincide exactly\nwith the interference chart. Watch your meter gauges, Karl, while I\nswitch to the atomic ray.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis fingers closed over a switch. The indigo points of flame bathing\nthe electrode gathered themselves into a ring and began to revolve\naround an invisible nucleus located near the electrode. Carruthers\nstudied the revolving flame for a moment, then switched off the\ntelevision machine. It was no longer needed.\n\nCarefully, for the atomic ray was still a mysterious force to\nCarruthers, he opened a small door in the panel and drew out the\nfocusing machine. It was shaped very much like a camera except that\nthe lens protruded several inches beyond the machine proper.\n\nWith infinite patience he made the final adjustments and moved away\nfrom the front of the lens. \"Ready?\"\n\nDanzig nodded and threw on the full power of the inverse dimensional\ntubes. A low clear hum filled the quiet room of the laboratory. From\nthe lens of the focusing machine shot a pale, amber beam. It struck\nthe glass test tube squarely in the center and glowed against its\nsmooth sides.\n\nCarruthers reached across his own machine and turned the final switch.\nThe amber beam emanating from the lens increased in intensity. And as\nit increased it took on a deep violet color.\n\nNanette cried out in muffled alarm. But even as Vincent raised his\nvoice to quiet her fears the test tube suddenly shrunk to nothingness\nand vanished into the ether.\n\n\"Aaron!\" whispered the girl, awesomely. \"It ... it's gone!\"\n\nCarruthers nodded. Beads of sweat stood out upon his forehead. Would\nthe returning ray work? He had made the test tube follow the same\nroute as that taken by Professor Dahlgren. Both were gone. He clicked\noff the switch and the beam faded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith a deliberate calmness that in no way matched the inner tumult\nbrought on by the experiment, he turned the dials of the machine he\nand Danzig had worked out together. A second switch clicked under his\nfingers. From the lense of the focusing machine shot the reverse\natomic beam. As it struck the center of the square it turned a bright\nvermilion. For several seconds it played upon empty space, then the\nmiracle unfolded before their eyes.\n\nSomething like a glass sliver reflected the beam. It grew and enlarged\nunder their startled eyes until it had achieved its former size, then\nthe power that had brought it back switched itself off automatically.\n\nTogether both men examined the test tube. It appeared in no way\nharmed, nor did it feel either warm or cold from its trip through the\nelements.\n\n\"It works!\" marveled Danzig. \"Let's try it again with something\nlarger.\"\n\n\"I've got a better idea,\" said Carruthers, rising to his feet. He\ncrossed the laboratory and went to another part of his rooms.\nPresently he returned holding a small pink rat in his hands. The\nrodent was young, having been born only a week before. \"Now we'll see\nwhat happens.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's torture to the poor thing,\" burst out Nanette.\n\n\"It won't hurt it,\" growled Karl. \"Aaron knows what he's doing.\"\n\nCarruthers placed the little rat in the center of the square. It lay\nthere, very quiet and unblinking. Again the switches clicked as the\ncontacts were closed.\n\nCame once more the beam of amber colored light followed closely by the\nviolet. The rat dwindled to the size of an insect, then disappeared\ninto space. The three watchers held their breaths. Carruthers' hand\ntrembled the least bit as he threw on the switch controlling the\nanimal's return to the world.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA vermilion shaft of light pierced the semi-darkened rooms. The animal\nhad been gone from sight not more than a minute. Abruptly something\ngrayish white unfolded in the reflector's beam. It rapidly expanded\nunder three pairs of bulging eyes--not the small, pinkish rat that had\ndisappeared but sixty seconds previous, but a full grown rat, scarred\nand tailless as if from innumerable battles with other rats.\n\nAs the current clicked off Aaron Carruthers bent forward. Too late.\nThe rat scurried from the laboratory with a squeal of alarm.\nCarruthers returned to his seat before the atomic machine and sat\ndown. His face was worried. Dark thoughts stormed his reason. The rat\nhe had placed within the atomic ray had aged nearly two years during\nthe minute it was out of mortal sight. Two years!\n\nHe pulled a pad from his pocket and calculated the time that had\nelapsed since Professor Dahlgren had vanished from that same spot.\nNearly forty hours. That would mean....\n\nNanette stirred in her chair. \"What happened to the little rat,\nAaron?\"\n\nCarruthers, busy making calculations, did not hear the question.\n\nShe turned to her brother. \"Karl, what's the meaning of this? The\nsecond experiment didn't turn out like the first one. What became of\nthat little rat?\"\n\n\"I don't know what happened, Nan,\" spoke Karl. \"Now don't bother me\nwith your silly questions. You saw the same thing I did.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarruthers raised his head and spoke quietly. \"That rat you saw\nmaterialize under the atomic rays was the same rat you saw me place\nwithin the square.\"\n\n\"But it couldn't be,\" protested the girl.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" shrugged Carruthers. \"It was the same animal--only it\nhad aged nearly two years during the brief time interval it was off\nfrom our planet.\"\n\n\"It's preposterous,\" cried the girl.\n\n\"Nothing is preposterous nowadays, Nanette.\"\n\n\"That's the woman of it,\" spoke Karl. \"Always doubting.\"\n\n\"You boys are playing tricks on me,\" retorted the girl sharply. \"I\nshouldn't have come to your old laboratory. Just because I'm a\ngirl....\"\n\n\"Don't,\" pleaded Carruthers, looking up from his pad of figures.\n\"We're trying to solve the mystery underlying the forces which we have\ncreated.\" He replaced the test tube within the center of the square\nand returned to the atomic machine.\n\nThrough the twilight shadows of the room glowed the strange new ray.\nFaintly the generator hummed. Lights sparkled and twisted around the\ncathode in serpentine swirls.\n\n\"You needn't trouble to explain your silly experiment again,\" finished\nNanette, rising abruptly to her feet. \"I'm going home and dress for\nthe New Year's party.\"\n\n\"Watch your switch like I asked you to,\" spoke Carruthers.\n\n\"Sit down,\" added Karl. \"Don't put the rest of us in danger!\"\n\n\"Oh-h-h!\" gasped the girl as she inadvertently stepped squarely into\nthe atomic ray of amber-colored light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarruthers leaped impatiently to his feet. An inarticulate cry of\nhorror froze upon his lips. Forgetful that he himself was directly in\nline of the atomic ray he lunged forward, his mind centering on a\nsingle act--to drag the protesting and now thoroughly frightened girl\nout of the path of the penetrating ray.\n\nBut even as he started forward Nanette tripped over the glass railing\naround the square. Carruthers moved quickly. Yet his movements were\nslow and ungainly as compared to the speed of the light ray. He saw\nthe figure of Nanette decrease in size before his eyes, heard the\nmuffled expression of alarm and fear in Danzig's voice; then the room\nsuddenly began to extend itself upward with the speed of a meteor.\n\nWhat once had been walls and bare furniture resolved themselves into a\nrange of hills, then mountains. The twilight gloom of the room became\na dark void of empty space that seemed to rush past his ears like a\nmoaning wind.\n\nHe had the sensation of falling through infinite space as if he had\nbeen propelled from the world and hurled out into the vastness of\ninterplanetary space. Something brushed against him--something soft\nand fluttering. He grasped it like a drowning man would clutch a\nstraw. \"Nanette!\"\n\nThe name echoed and re-echoed through his mind yet never seemed to get\nbeyond his tightly clenched lips. He felt something cool close over\nhis hand. Instinctively he grasped it. Her hand. Together they clung\nto each other as they felt themselves being hurled through endless\nspace.\n\nThe twilight changed swiftly to black night that rushed past the two\nclinging figures and enveloped them in a wall of silence. Then out of\nthe mysterious fastness came the dull glow of what looked like a\ndistant planet. It grew and enlarged till it reached the size of a\nsilver dollar. Little pin-points of light soon began to appear on all\nsides of it, very much like stars.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarruthers attempted to reassure Nanette that all was well, and they\nwere out on the streets of the great metropolis. But even as he\nwrenched his tightly locked lips apart he saw that the shining disc\nfar out into space was not what he had first thought it was--the\nearth's moon.\n\nHe shook his head to clear it of the perplexing cobwebs. What was the\nmatter with his mind? He couldn't think or reason. All he knew was\nthat he had erred. This strange planet looming in the sky held\nnothing familiar in markings nor in respect to its relations to the\nstars beyond it.\n\nWhile yet he groped in the darkness for something tangible, his mind\nreverted to the girl at his side. She was clinging to him like a\nfrightened child. He could feel the pressure of her body against his\nand it thrilled him immeasurably. No longer was he the cold,\ncalculating young man of science.\n\nHow long they remained in state of suspension while strange worlds and\nplanets flashed into a new sky before their startled eyes, Aaron\nCarruthers didn't know. At times it seemed like hours, years, ages.\nAnd when he thought of the tender nearness of the girl he held so\ntightly within his arms, it seemed like a few minutes.\n\nGradually the sensation of speed and space falling began to wear off,\nas if they were nearing earth or some solid substance once more. The\nair about them grew heavier. Then all movement through space ceased.\n\nCarruthers was surprised to find what felt like earth beneath his\nfeet. For long minutes he stood there, unmoving, still holding\npossessively to the girl.\n\n\"Aaron!\" The name came out of the void like a faint caress.\n\n\"Nanette.\"\n\nReassured of each other's presence they stood perfectly still, lost in\nthe vast silence of their isolation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPresently the girl spoke. \"Oh, Aaron, I'm frightened!\"\n\n\"There's nothing to be alarmed at, dearest.\" The endearing term came\nfor the first time from the man's lips. As long as he had known\nNanette Danzig, love had never been mentioned between them. If it had\never existed, the feeling had not been expressed.\n\n\"You shouldn't call me that, Aaron.\"\n\nHis voice sounded curiously far-off when he answered. \"I couldn't help\nit, Nan. Our nearness, the strange darkness, and the fact that we are\nalone together brought strange emotions to my heart. At this moment\nyou are the dearest--\"\n\nBump, thump! Bump, thump!\n\n\"What's that noise?\" breathed Nanette.\n\nCarruthers turned his head to listen. To his ears came the pound of\nsome heavy object striking the ground at well-regulated intervals.\n\nNanette, who had started to free herself from Carruthers violent\nembrace, suddenly ceased to struggle. \"Oh, what is it? What is it?\"\nshe whispered fearfully.\n\nCarruthers sniffed the night air. A musky odor assailed his nostrils,\nstrange and unfamiliar. \"It's beyond me, Nanette. Let's move away from\nthis spot. Perhaps we can find shelter for the rest of the night.\"\n\nBut the Stygian blackness successfully hid any form of shelter. Tired\nfrom their search they sat down.\n\n\"We might build a fire,\" suggested Carruthers, \"only there doesn't\nseem to be any wood around. Nothing but bare rock.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's just as well,\" spoke the girl. \"The flames might attract\nprowlers.\"\n\n\"Maybe you're right,\" agreed Carruthers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA silence fell between them. After a long time Nanette spoke.\n\n\"I don't suppose, Aaron, that anything I can do or say will help\nmatters any. I know that our being where we are is my own fault. I'm\nsorry. Truly I am.\"\n\n\"The harm is done,\" said Carruthers. \"Don't say anything more about\nit.\"\n\nNanette pointed at the disc of light shining high in the heavens.\n\"These stars are as strange to me, Aaron, as if I had never seen them\nbefore. Saturn is the evening star at this time of year. It isn't\nvisible. Even the familiar craters and mountains of the moon look\ndifferent. And it glows strangely.\"\n\n\"I'd rather not talk about it, Nan.\"\n\nNanette placed a hand upon his arm. \"I'm not a child, Aaron. I'm a\ngrown woman. Fear comes through not knowing. Tell me the truth.\"\n\n\"Let's sit down.\"\n\nThey sat upon the ground and both stared out at the night heavens that\narched into infinity above them. Presently Carruthers took the girl's\nhand from his arm and held it gently between his own. \"You've guessed\nrightly, Nan. The orb shining upon us is not our moon. I'll try and\nmake it clear.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl smiled reassuringly in the darkness. \"I'm waiting.\"\n\n\"Strange as it must seem,\" began Carruthers, \"you and I are still\nwithin the room of my laboratory. But we might as well be a million\nmiles away for all the good it does us. Karl sits in his chair in the\nsame position as when we disappeared in the violet glow of the atomic\nray. His eyes are bulging with fear and horror. For days and days\nhe'll continue to sit on that chair, his mind not yet attuned to what\nactually took place. What has happened? He doesn't know yet, Nan.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's incredible,\" sobbed Nanette.\n\n\"I know, but it's so obviously true that I won't even trouble to check\nmy calculations.\" He pointed at the silver disc hanging low in the\nstrange sky. \"That, Nan, is not our moon. It is nothing more than a\nplanetary electron very much like the one we are on at the present\nmoment. The firmament is filled with them. From where we sit we can\nsee but the half nearest to us. The glowing portion is illuminated\nfrom distant light rays shot off from the nucleus of the atom itself.\nThat atom is going to be our light and heat for weeks, months, perhaps\nyears to come. We're prisoners on an electron, and as such we are\ndestined to rush through infinite space for the remainder of our lives\nunless....\"\n\n\"Unless what?\"\n\nAaron Carruthers hesitated for a bare fraction of a second. \"Karl!\" he\nwhispered. \"Our lives depend on him. Time flies fast for us, Nan.\nAlready it is growing light. But not on our earth. Karl still sits\nupon his chair staring incredulously at the miracle of our\ndisappearing bodies. It will take weeks of time, as it affects us, for\nthe initial shock to travel along his nerves to the center of his\nbrain.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis voice shook with emotion quite contrary to his usual calm nature.\n\"Oh, I know it's hard to understand, Nan. I was a fool to meddle with\nlaws of which I know so little compared to what there is yet to know.\"\n\n\"Then it's all true, Aaron. The little rat that came out from under\nthe ray as an old rat was one and the same animal.\"\n\nCarruthers nodded. \"Time has changed in proportion to our size. We're\nmoving so much faster than the earth that we must of necessity be\nbound to the universe of which we are now an integral part.\"\n\nFor a long time they remained silent, each immersed in dark, troubled\nthoughts. Nanette broke the silence.\n\n\"You don't suppose, Aaron, by any chance that Professor Dahlgren is\nstill alive and on our planet?\"\n\nCarruthers shook his head negatively. \"It's beyond human reason, Nan.\nHe was lost in the ray for over forty hours. Translated into minutes\nhe's been gone twenty-four hundred minutes. Since the mouse we placed\nwithin the light ray aged approximately two years in the space of one\nminute, Professor Dahlgren would, if he were alive, be about four\nthousand, eight hundred years old.\"\n\nNanette rose abruptly to her feet. \"Oh bother the figures. My head's\nswimming with them. It's getting light now, and I'm hungry.\"\n\n\"Eat one of your food tablets,\" suggested Carruthers.\n\n\"Please don't get funny,\" said Nanette. \"Karl has them in his coat\npocket.\"\n\n\"Hum-m-m!\" coughed Carruthers, following her example by rising to his\nfeet. \"Looks as though we'd have to rustle our food. I've got nothing\non my person but a knife, a pencil, a fountain pen and some pieces of\npaper. Nothing very promising in any of them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt that moment the sky became fused with reddish light. Over the\nhorizon appeared a shining orb. Far-away hills and valleys leaped into\nsight. Then for the first time Carruthers noted the high plateau upon\nwhich he had spent the night. Had they ventured a hundred yards\nfarther during the night they would have plunged into the rocky floor\nof a canyon a thousand feet below.\n\n\"Let's see if we can find a way down to the valley,\" he suggested. \"If\nwe get anything to eat it will have to come from trees. This plateau\nis barren of any form of vegetable matter.\"\n\nThey found a winding descent leading downward. It looked like a path\nthat had been worn by the passage of many feet.\n\n\"Someone's been here before us,\" he exclaimed. \"The ground is too well\nworn to be accidental.\"\n\n\"Look! Look!\" pointed Nanette. Her face had become pale from the\nexcitement of her discovery. \"What is it, Aaron?\"\n\nCarruthers bent forward to examine the strange footprint. It was\nnearly two feet across and divided in the center, as if the animal\nthat made it had but two toes.\n\n\"From the size of the tracks and the length of the animal's stride, I\nshould say it was some form of an amphibious dinosaur long extinct in\nour own world.\"\n\n\"Are they dangerous?\"\n\n\"It all depends upon the species. Some of them are pure vegetarians;\nothers are carnivorous. The heavy tramping we heard during the night\nevidently came from the beast who left these footprints.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey had come upon the footprints where the path made a turn, leading\ninto a dense growth of trees and underbrush. And as Carruthers knelt\nbeside the path he heard a rustle as of something moving directly\nbehind him. Wonderingly, he turned his head to trace the disturbance.\nBut the woods seemed empty. \"Strange,\" he murmured. \"Did you hear\nsomething moving in back of us, Nan?\"\n\nNan shook her head. \"You don't think we're in any danger from these\nbeasts, do you?\"\n\nCarruthers said nothing for the moment. Instead, he looked sharply in\nall directions and saw nothing. \"Let's push on till we come to some\nkind of a shelter. Perhaps we'll find people much like ourselves.\"\n\nDown the path they hurried, glancing curiously right and left at\nunknown flowers and trees. A bird with brilliant feathers skimmed\nabove their heads, uttering shrill cries. Other voices from the birds\nand animals in the woods took up the cry. The woods grew denser as\nthey pushed into the unknown.\n\nIn the woods at their right a rodent squeaked as some larger animal\npounced upon it. Presently they came to a pool of water roughly\nseventy feet across. While they knelt to quench their thirst they saw\ntwo young deer eyeing them from the far side. Soft feet pattered\nbehind the kneeling couple. Carruthers half whirled as he rose to his\nfeet and peered into the jungle behind him.\n\nA blur of reddish brown vanished behind a tree. Man or animal\nCarruthers couldn't determine. He grasped Nanette by the arm and\npulled her back to the path.\n\n\"Quick!\" he whispered. \"There's someone or something following us. I'm\nsure of it now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNanette's voice trembled slightly. \"What is it, Aaron?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" He turned his head again. This time he saw the thing\nthat was following. A low ejaculation of alarm escaped his lips. A\ngigantic ape! The mouth of the creature sagged grotesquely, revealing\ntwo rows of yellow fangs. And its orange colored eyes were burning\ncoals set close together. Carruthers sucked in a deep breath.\n\n\"Run, Nan,\" he gritted. \"I'll try and scare him away.\"\n\nSimultaneously with the scream of fright from the startled girl, a\nhuge mountain of grayish flesh and bones blocked the downward slope of\nthe path. Carruthers paled as he turned and faced the new menace.\n\nComing directly toward them he saw an immense animal so great in size\nthat it seemed to shut out the light. A prehistoric dinosaur! It came\nslowly and leisurely, swinging its great red mouth from side to side.\nOther denizens in the woods, sensing the presence of the huge killer,\nfled in a panic of alarm. Their shrill cries increased the terror that\nfroze the hearts of the two earth people.\n\nNanette clung to her companion in abject terror, unable to move. Her\nfear stricken eyes were wild and staring as the mountain of flesh\npushed towards them.\n\nThe animal's long neck arched far in front of its body, and its long,\npointed tail remained out of sight within the trees.\n\nCarruthers backed off the path into the underbrush, dragging the girl\nafter him. The jaws of the huge animal opened wide with anticipation.\nLumberingly he turned from the path and followed. Trees crashed before\nits gigantic bulk. The woods became a bedlam of snapping branches.\n\nThe horrified scream of the girl ended in a gurgling sigh. She toppled\nto the ground in a dead faint. Carruthers flung himself beside her\ncrumpled body and gathered it into his arms. A quick glance he threw\nat the spot where he had last seen the gigantic ape. The animal was no\nlonger there. It had disappeared.\n\nThe man's lips became a hard, straight line. Even as he straightened\nto his feet the leaves and branches of an overturned tree whipped his\nface. The red mouthed dinosaur was perilously near. So close that\nCarruthers could smell its great, glistening body. The odor was musky\nand foul.\n\nStumbling blindly he attempted to widen the distance between himself\nand his pursuer. But the hungry dinosaur pounded steadily on its\ncourse. There was no getting away from it. Its beady eyes sought out\nits prey and its keen smell told it exactly where the earth beings\nwere.\n\nOn and on staggered Carruthers. The extra burden of the girl hampered\nhis movements. Unseen roots tripped him time and time again. Each time\nhe scrambled to his feet and picked up the unconscious girl. Briars\ntore at his clothing and stung his hands.\n\nThe underbrush was thickening. A warm, dank smell clung to the\nvegetation now almost tropical in nature. Beads of sweat rolled down\nthe man's forehead and into his eyes. But the horrible fear of those\nred, dripping jaws spurred him to renewed efforts.\n\nHe doubled to the left, hoping to throw the animal off his tracks. The\nundergrowth seemed to thin out at this point. Renewed hope flowed\nthrough the young scientist's blood. He stumbled on blindly, scarce\nwatching where his feet were taking him. A sigh of relief came to his\nlips. Ahead of him he saw a clearing. His stride lengthened and he\nbroke into a shambling run.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen it was he saw, towering walls rising up on both sides of\nhim--steep walls that he could never scale, even if alone. He tried to\nchange his course, but the huge bulk of the pursuing dinosaur\neffectively blocked his path. There was no alternative but to push on\nand pray for an opening in the rugged cliffs.\n\nAbruptly a sigh of despair escaped his lips. The walls of the canyon\nnarrowed suddenly, and across it stretched a wall of bare rock. He\nrealized too late that he had returned to the base of the plateau\nwhere he had spent the night. The grim, towering walls hemmed him in\ncompletely from three sides. At the fourth side bulked the dinosaur,\ncoming slowly, ponderously.\n\nBeady eyes peered down cunningly at the helpless man and woman.\nConfident now that its prey couldn't escape, it extended its huge bulk\nacross the narrow canyon for a leisurely killing.\n\nCarruthers glared at the monster with fear-distended eyes. In his\nheart he realized that there was no escape. He had no means of\ndefense, no way to combat the huge monster but flight. And even that\nwas now denied him.\n\nCloser and closer inched the killer until its great, red mouth\nappeared like the fire box of a huge boiler. Hot breath fanned the\nman's cheek. The nauseous odor of the beast made his stomach wrench.\nHe dropped to his knees close to the inert figure of the girl and\nglared vengefully into the beady eyes.\n\nThe gaping mouth at the end of a long, supple neck jerked forward.\nCarruthers dragged the girl away just in time to escape the gnashing\nteeth. The dinosaur stamped angrily.\n\nOnce again Carruthers felt its hot breath beating upon his face. He\ncringed at the thought of this kind of death. No one would ever know\nhow it happened. Not even his closest friend, Karl Danzig! What a mess\nthings were. Why didn't the red mouth of the mighty dinosaur close\nover him and crush out life? Why must he kneel in torture?\n\nFrom near at hand a piercing scream rang through the air. A harsh\nscream. A terrifying scream!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarruthers raised his head. The dinosaur had twisted around to glare\nhatefully at the disturber of its meal. Other screams splintered the\nforest air. And as the kneeling man watched he saw the great red ape\nwho had been dodging his footsteps a short time before, slouch between\nthe dinosaur's hulking body and the wall of the cliff. Behind it came\nothers--black mammals with curving arms that dragged along the ground.\n\nTheir fangs were bared. They were in an ugly mood. Arriving in front\nof the dinosaur and less than four feet from the earth man and woman,\nthe leader silenced its followers with a low growl and turned in\nconcentrated fury upon the dinosaur. Its long arms drummed a throbbing\ntattoo upon its hairy chest.\n\nThe dinosaur bellowed protestingly against the attitude of the apes\nand gorillas. The ape leader protested with equal violence. The\ndinosaur shifted uneasily, wagging its heavy head from side to side.\nOn all sides came deep growls from the mammals.\n\nCarruthers watched all this display torn between doubt and fear. Which\nside would win? How could the apes and gorillas, huge as they were,\nhope to force the dinosaur away? But the apes were masters. This much\nwas apparent. Inch by inch the dinosaur backed away, glaring\nvengefully. And having reached a spot where it could turn around it\ndid so. Presently the ground trembled as it made off through the\nsteaming jungle. The leader of the mammals turned and faced the earth\npeople. Long, searching minutes passed. Its close set eyes seemed to\nbe studying them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNanette stirred and opened her eyes. The sight of the anthropoids\ncaused her to recoil.\n\n\"Steady, Nan,\" spoke Carruthers softly.\n\nOther apes and gorillas gathered around the giant red animal. They\ndisplayed no hostility, only an intense interest. One by one they\nsquatted before the earth people until they formed a half circle,\nreaching from the one wall of the rocky plateau to the other.\n\nWhile they sat there it began to grow dark. Carruthers removed his\nwatch and ventured a glance at it. Daylight had lasted less then three\nhours. An hour for twilight, then it would be dark. Evidently the\ncycle around the nucleus of the atom took approximately ten hours.\n\nNanette sat up. \"Aaron!\"\n\nHe answered without removing his eyes from the red ape less then four\nfeet away. \"Don't look at me, Nan. Concentrate on the big, red fellow.\nHe's evidently in control. If we act the least bit frightened they\nmight decide to destroy us.\"\n\n\"What are they waiting for? Why don't they go away?\"\n\n\"We'll know before long. I imagine they're trying to figure out who we\nare and what we are doing on their tiny planet.\"\n\nDarkness descended rapidly. Overhead, a small moon rose majestically\nin the heavens and started its journey through the night. Its faint\nlight revealed the fact that the apes showed no intentions of leaving.\nThey still squatted before the earth people, in a half circle of\nstaring brown eyes.\n\nWhatever fear Carruthers had felt towards the animals died away.\n\"They're harmless,\" he told Nanette. \"Get some sleep if you can.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLong after the tired girl had drifted into slumber Carruthers sat with\nhis back against the wall, mentally trying to figure the whole thing\nout. The dinosaur was real enough. Yet the apemen had frightened it\naway, in fact had compelled it to go without actually engaging in\ncombat. No question about it. The anthropoids were in control. But who\ncontrolled them?\n\nQuite suddenly his eyes snapped open. Daylight had come again. He must\nhave fallen asleep. The shrill chatter of the apeman came to his ears.\nThe red ape leader shuffled to his feet and looked from the earth\npeople to the spot in the jungle whence came the chatter. Abruptly he\nopened his mouth and emitted a flood of gibberish sounds.\n\nThe gorillas and apes at his side flattened their bodies against the\nrocky walls in attitudes of expectant waiting.\n\n\"What's happening?\" gasped the girl.\n\n\"There's no telling,\" whispered Aaron. \"It must be someone or\nsomething of importance. Note the expressions of awe and reverence on\nthe faces of the apemen. My God, Nanette, look!\"\n\nOut of the depths of the jungle emerged seven white beings--human or\nanimal it was impossible to tell. They were huge creatures with the\nbodies of men. Erect of carriage, almost human in looks, they\ncontrasted strangely with the red apes and the black gorillas. Six of\nthem appeared to act as bodyguard for the seventh.\n\nAs they reached the space in front of the two earth people, the\nbodyguard stepped aside. The seventh white one came to a dead stop.\nLong and intently he stared at the man and girl crouched against the\nwall. And the scrutiny seemed to please him, for he smiled.\n\nCarruthers eyed the figure uneasily. He saw what seemed to be a man\ndressed in a long, fibrous garment. With white hair and beard, it was\na strange figure indeed for an apeman. He saw also that the eyes were\nwell spaced, a mark of intelligence. The forehead was high and broad.\nAnd as Carruthers mentally studied the creature, strange and bizarre\nthoughts crossed his mind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe mouth of the white apeman twitched as if he were going to speak.\nThe heavy lips parted. A single word came to Carruthers' ear--\"Man?\"\n\nCarruthers nodded. \"We are from the earth.\"\n\nThe lips of the apeman moved painfully as if speech came with the\nutmost of difficulty. \"The prophecy of the Great One has been\nfulfilled even as it has been written.\"\n\nThe red apes and black gorillas allowed their eyes to wander from\ntheir white leader to the two earth people. And their faces reflected\nthe supernatural awe with which they regarded the earth people.\n\n\"It's uncanny that an animal can speak our language,\" breathed\nNanette.\n\nAs if he hadn't heard her, Carruthers spoke again. \"We are from the\nearth,\" he repeated. \"We have been on your world many hours, and we\nare both hungry and thirsty.\"\n\n\"Words come hard,\" came from the lips of the white bearded one. \"I\nhave not used them for years.\"\n\n\"And who are you?\" asked Carruthers.\n\nThe white bearded one paused as if to recall some distant echo from\nthe past. \"I am the last of the tribe of Esau. But come! This is no\nplace for speech. Long have I and my followers waited for this hour.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithout another word he swung around. The six guards enclosed his aged\nbody in a hollow square and the procession moved away. They came after\na short journey to a natural opening leading to the heart of the\nplateau. The apes and gorillas, with the exception of the red leader,\nremained outside. The remainder of the party pushed through a tortuous\ntunnel until they reached a cavernous opening directly beneath the\nplateau. Vertical openings in the walls furnished light and air. The\nwhite chieftain spoke in a strange tongue to his followers, and they\ninstantly prepared three couches in a far corner of the cavern.\n\nAs the earth people seated themselves on the skins that made up the\ncouch they were both conscious of a far-away rumbling like peals of\nthunder. Not having seen any signs of a storm outside Carruthers\nturned inquiringly on the aged chieftain.\n\nThe old man's eyes were shadowed with grim foreboding. \"I have ordered\nsomething to refresh you and your companion,\" he said. \"Eat first, my\nfriends. We will talk later.\"\n\nThe six body-guards left the main cavern. Presently they returned with\nlarge trays made of fanlike leaves resembling the palmetto. Fresh\nfruits and uncooked vegetables formed the bulk of the meal. In silence\nthey ate. After the litter had been cleared away the guards withdrew\nwith the exception of the giant red ape, who crouched near the opening\nto the tunnel.\n\n\"I am glad you have come,\" began the old chieftain, \"but sorry, too.\nOur planet, or rather the higher forms of life upon it, are doomed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain there came to the ears of the earth people that far-off beat of\nsound that seemed to shake the ground. They looked to the white\nbearded leader for explanation.\n\n\"Ah, you hear it too,\" murmured the other. \"For centuries, we of the\ngreat tribe of Esau have fought for the supremacy of our little\nworld--ever since the Great One appeared in our midst and instructed\nus in world knowledge.\"\n\n\"And this Great One, as you call him,\" spoke Carruthers. \"Who was he?\"\n\n\"He was from your world. I never saw him. He comes to me as a legend.\nFor years he toiled among us, teaching and instructing until we\nmastered his language. He called himself Dahlgren. Later he ruled all\nthe tribes. We of the Esau line he made into leaders because of our\nhigher intelligence. The tribes of Zaku were trained for war. Perhaps\nyou have noticed the chief of all the Zakus. He is crouching now\nbeside the entrance to our inner walls. He is Marbo, and his followers\nlive in the jungles.\"\n\n\"And does he talk as you do?\"\n\nThe white chieftain shook his head. \"No. Only we of the Esau tribe\nhave mastered speech. Not counting the women of our tribe that\ncomprise our numbers we are only seven in all.\"\n\n\"I owe Marbo my life as does also my companion,\" said Carruthers.\n\n\"Marbo looks upon you earth people as gods,\" spoke the old chieftain.\n\"He and his followers will protect you with their lives.\"\n\n\"And who rules over and beyond?\" questioned Carruthers, waving his arm\nto cover the remaining portion of the electron.\n\n\"There is no rule beyond except that of force. The Great One called\nthem by name, Morosaurus, Diplodocus, the Horned Ceratosaurus, and\nmany others whose names I have long forgotten. They are our enemies\nwhom we cannot destroy. And their numbers increase from year to year\nand are slowly backing us upon our last stronghold.\"\n\n\"Isn't there anything we can do?\" asked Carruthers, feeling a quiver\nof apprehension along his spine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly, the old chieftain shook his head. \"Nothing whatever. Marbo and\nhis followers can control one or two, but when the herds begin to push\non into our territory, we are doomed. Even now their rumblings and\nbellowings come through the jungles. Their thirst and hunger for flesh\nis enormous.\"\n\nCarruthers turned upon the girl. \"The old chief's words explain\neverything, Nan. Professor Dahlgren has been here and gone. He lived a\nlifetime in the span of a few hours earth-time. Now it looks as if we\nwere destined to follow in his footsteps.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid,\" said the girl. \"Nothing can be worse than what we\nhave already passed through.\" And her eyes softened as she placed her\nsmall hands within those of Carruthers. \"We have each other, Aaron.\"\n\nHe smiled reassuringly and turned to the old chieftain. \"I am\nCarruthers, a friend and assistant to Dahlgren. The girl here is\nNanette.\"\n\nThe chieftain smiled gravely. \"And I am Zark. Welcome to my kingdom,\nCarruthers and Nanette. We need you here. Now tell me of your world,\nfor long have I waited for a follower of the great Dahlgren to appear\nbefore my people.\"\n\nThroughout the remainder of the day Carruthers talked. The shafts of\nlight paled at the end of the short day. Night came, bringing with it\na sense of security against the increasing hordes that thundered and\ntrumpeted beyond the borders of the jungle.\n\nIn the morning Zark instructed Marbo to remain close to Carruthers at\nall times. So the young scientist left the cavern and ascended the\npath leading to the top of the plateau. He looked at his watch and\ncompared the second hand with the nucleus atom sailing across the\nheavens to estimate its speed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDays passed as he made his observations. Meanwhile he had searched and\nfound the exact spot wherein he and Nanette had first stepped foot\nonto the electron. This spot he carefully marked off with a ring of\nhuge boulders carried up by the followers of Marbo. Then he began to\ncalculate upon his pad. There must be no mistakes. He and Nanette must\nbe within the magic circle at the estimated time.\n\nBetween times he helped Nanette construct their living quarters in the\ncavern. Zark had furnished them with skins and furs with which to\ncover the walls. Carruthers made a fireplace of stones and restored\nthe lost art of fire to Zark, Marbo and their followers.\n\nDays slipped by like minutes. Short days filled with excursions into\nthe jungles. Carruthers' face soon bristled with a stubble of beard.\nThis lengthened with time. Sharp thorns tore their clothes to ribbons.\nNanette, womanlike, cried many times during the nights because of the\nlack of a mirror and a comb for her untidy hair.\n\nBut other and more important events soon claimed the attention of the\nearth people. Day by day the herds of dinosaurs and other monsters of\nlike breed edged closer and closer to the tiny civilization around the\nplateau. It worried Carruthers so much that he sought out Zark and had\nhim bring the other six members of his tribe together for a council of\nwar.\n\n\"A complete defensive system, Zark,\" he told them. \"We must make a\nfortress of the plateau and fill the caverns with food.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nZark shook his head. \"No. It is quite useless. Followers of Marbo have\nrecently returned from over the beyond and report strange things. I\nhave hesitated to speak of them for fear of alarming you. Our planet\nis breaking up. Violent eruptions have caused fires of stone and mud.\nThe rumblings you have heard were not made entirely by our enemies.\nThey came from the ground.\n\n\"An earthquake,\" murmured Carruthers, momentarily stunned by the news.\n\"But they are always of short duration, Zark. We have them on our own\nplanet.\"\n\n\"Ah, but these are different. They cover the whole of our globe. The\ngreat Dahlgren noted them while he was with us. He wrote many words\nand figures on paper concerning them. Only yesterday I unearthed these\nrecords. The life of our planet was doomed to destruction during the\npresent year. What matter if the herds of dinosaurs overrun us and\ndestroy lives? In the end they, too, will be destroyed. It is fate. We\ncan do nothing.\"\n\nEven as the old chieftain spoke a gigantic rumbling, greater in\nintensity than any heretofore, shook the electron. Above the deep\nrolling disturbance underground rose the shrill cries of the apemen.\n\nCarruthers leaped to his feet and raced through the tunnel. A herd of\ndinosaurs choked the path leading to the outside entrance. Marbo\nbrushed past him, shrilling in great excitement.\n\n\"Drive them away!\" ordered Carruthers. \"Like this!\" He hurled a rock\nat the eye of the nearest animal.\n\nThe dinosaur bellowed and backed away. The apes, and gorillas, used to\nfighting only with their long arms, caught on to the stunt with\nsurprising quickness. Their powerful arms reached out. Stones and\nboulders began to hurtle from the mouth of the tunnel. They thudded\nagainst the heads of the great monsters like hailstones.\n\nSubdued and frightened by this sudden display of force, the monsters\nwithdrew down the path. But the apemen had discovered a new method of\nwarfare. They found a childish delight in hurling stones. Within a few\nminutes the slope was barren of rocks. The animals followed up their\nmomentary advantage and ran screaming down the path. The dinosaurs\nfled in panic.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAS soon as the enemy had been driven away, Carruthers pointed out to\nMarbo the advantage of gathering the stones up from the ground and\nreturning them to the space around the mouth of the tunnel so that he\nand his followers would be ready for a second repulse.\n\nZark appeared at this moment and helped with the explanation. His\ncrafty old eyes turned with new respect upon the earthman.\n\nCarruthers toiled with them every day from then on, building and\nfortifying the plateau against further incursions of the monsters.\nSecurity and peace reigned for several weeks then hostilities broke\nout afresh.\n\nThe rumblings of the electron had increased with each passing week.\nVolcanic eruptions poured fresh discharges of molten lava and fiery\nsparks along the edges of the jungles.\n\n\"I don't want to needlessly alarm you, Nan,\" he told her that night,\n\"but the fires have started. Zark was right. Unless we have rain\nbefore to-morrow morning the heat and smoke will drive us out into\nthe open.\"\n\n\"But we can go to the top of the plateau,\" suggested the girl. \"There\naren't any trees--\"\n\nA concentrated bellowing cut off the rest of her words. Driven towards\nhigher ground by the heat of the flames, the dinosaurs were trampling\nup the path leading to the tunnel.\n\nOnce again Carruthers rallied his army of apemen around him and\nattempted to drive the mammals away. As they reached the end of the\ntunnel a cloud of dense smoke stung their eyes. The apemen shrilled in\na sudden panic and forgot all their previous training in driving off\nthe dinosaurs. Like scurrying rats they scattered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFlames from the conflagration broke through the smoke--flames that\nleaped and twisted skyward.\n\nCarruthers flung off the fear that held him spellbound and started\nalong up the path leading to the top of the plateau. A disheveled\nfigure appeared suddenly at his side--Nanette!\n\n\"Come,\" he whispered, hoarsely. \"We've got to get out of this or we'll\nchoke to death.\"\n\n\"But Zark,\" breathed the girl, \"He and his followers are still in the\ncavern. We can't leave them.\"\n\nLike one demented of reason, Carruthers raced back along the tunnel to\nthe cavern. \"Zark!\" he shouted.\n\nThe sound of his voice was drowned in the welter of screaming bedlam\ncoming up from below as the dinosaurs and apes fought for the\nsupremacy of life. But of Zark and his six followers he found\nabsolutely no sign. Quickly he hurried back to where he had left\nNanette.\n\nEven as he reached the spot he had a sudden premonition of danger. A\ngorilla, huge and black, brushed past him on the path, carrying a limp\nburden under his shaggy arm.\n\n\"Stop!\" commanded Carruthers, hurrying after the animal.\n\nA huge arm knocked him sprawling. Spitting blood Carruthers staggered\nto his feet. Up to this time he had felt no fear of the gorillas. They\nhad been orderly and well behaved. Fearful that harm would come to the\ngirl he ran after the dark figure ahead. The red glow of flames swept\nnearer. The gorilla came to a stop and faced its pursuer. Lust shone\nfrom its close-set eyes--lust and passion.\n\nCarruthers stopped dead in his tracks. \"Drop her!\" he demanded.\n\nThe animal snarled hoarsely. There came the sound of ripping cloth.\nNanette screamed--a terrifying scream that echoed and re-echoed\nthrough the electron night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was then that the thin cloak of civilization dropped from Aaron\nCarruthers' back. He became in a single moment an animal fighting for\nhis mate. With a snarl equally vicious as that of the gorilla pawing\nat the helpless girl, he lunged forward.\n\nMouthing his rage, the gorilla flung the earth man to the ground.\nCarruthers came up frothing at the mouth. With grim intensity he\nfastened himself to the animal's free arm. The raging mammal staggered\nhelplessly under the extra burden and dropped the girl to concentrate\nhis fury on the man. It raised a hairy arm aloft for the smashing\nblow. Instinctively Carruthers released his hold.\n\nAt that very moment the electron lurched sickeningly, causing them\nboth to lose their footing. The violent upheaval sent Carruthers one\nway and the gorilla the other. While the man stumbled to his feet to\nresume battle he saw the infuriated monster stagger over the edge of\nthe plateau wall into a sheer drop of a thousand feet.\n\nStarkly through the night came the growling roars of the giant beasts\nfrom the jungles below. Nanette fluttered to his side. Her dress was\ntorn and dragged on the ground. For all her disheveled appearance she\nwas still beautiful to look upon. Forgetful of the danger on all sides\nof him, the animal in Carruthers saw in her pitifully half-clad body\nthe same thing that the beast had desired. His head whirled hotly.\n\n\"Aaron!\" she pleaded as his arm reached out to clutch her.\n\nHungrily he drew her to him. The pale light of the electron moon\nmingled with the roaring blast of the flames. Madness inflamed his\nheart and pounded his blood.\n\n\"Don't, Aaron,\" protested the girl, trying to free herself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomething in the quality of the girl's frightened tones brought the\nman back to normal. He fought against the overwhelming desire to\npossess with all the force of his nature. And the better half\ntriumphed. No longer was he an animal, but a reasoning human being.\nWith a faint sigh he released her and wiped a hand across his dripping\nforehead.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Nan,\" he murmured. \"That great brute drove me mad for an\ninstant. I'm all right now.\"\n\nTogether they stood in the electron night and watched death creep\ncloser and closer. The plateau was entirely surrounded with flames now\nand the heat was increasing with each passing moment. As it increased\nthey backed towards the center.\n\nFrom under their feet came the choking cries of the apemen. They had\nreturned to the cavern only to be overcome by smoke fumes. While yet\nthe earth people stood there waiting and watching the red death creep\nnearer, the path leading downward into the jungle became a mass of\nmoving shadows.\n\n\"The dinosaurs!\" cried Nanette. \"Oh, Aaron! We are lost!\"\n\n\"Steady, girl,\" soothed the man. \"If we stand still they might not see\nus in the dark. The smoke will destroy our scent.\"\n\nBut as the minutes passed the herd of monsters increased. They crowded\nalong the path and spread out over the top of the plateau. Once again\nthe smell of their glistening bodies fouled the nostrils of the earth\npeople.\n\nSlowly Carruthers guided Nanette back towards the ring of\nrocks--perhaps the barrier would serve to keep the animals away. He\nscrambled across one of the boulders and pulled the girl after him. As\nhe did so, a violent subterranean action shook the electron from one\nend to the other.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarruthers braced his feet against the ring of rocks to keep from\npitching headlong to the ground. Nanette clung to him wordlessly. All\naround them the giant forces of nature raged sullenly. Twisting seams\nappeared in the rocky floor of the plateau from which oozed gaseous\nvapors.\n\n\"Courage,\" soothed Carruthers as he held the quivering body of the\nfrightened girl close to his own. \"This can't last.\"\n\nBut the ground continued to lurch and heave on its axis. Vivid lights\ncrossed and criss-crossed the atomic heavens. The fissures in the\nground appeared now as black canals. The lower part of the circle of\nboulders disappeared. Off to the right came despairing screams. White\nbodies glowed for an instant against the background of flames.\n\n\"Zark!\" shouted Carruthers, as he saw the leader of the tribe of Esau\nand his followers making their way along the plateau top.\n\nZark must have heard the earth-man's voice, for he started forward at\na run. Simultaneously there appeared a herd of the greatest of all the\nprehistoric monsters--the Brontosaurus. They balked enormously against\nthe flame-licked skies. Zark and his followers attempted to avoid\nthem. But fear of the scorching flames drove the monsters forward.\nThere followed a maddening moment of unutterable pain for the\nremaining ones of the tribe of Esau, then the herd trampled them\nunderfoot and rumbled towards the half circle of rocks where the two\nearth people were crouched.\n\nThe leader of the Brontosaurus herd trumpeted madly and barged for the\nhigher ground of safety. Too late did instinct warn it of the widening\nfissure underfoot. Before it could stop the pressure of the herd drove\nit into the crevice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarruthers drew back to the extreme inside edge of the boulders trying\nto still his ears against their insane bellowings. A cloud of heavy,\nchoking smoke enveloped him for a moment then passed away. Then it was\nthat he saw a new star in the atomic heavens,--a star that seemed to\nburn with the brilliance of a meteor. Even as he watched he was\nconscious of it drawing closer.\n\nThe planet was now in a continuous uproar. The ground was heaving and\ntrembling as if from some inward strain. This was the end. Carruthers\nrealized it with a sinking heart. In another minute the electron would\ndisintegrate into a flaming mass of matter and fling itself from its\norbit around the atom.\n\nAnd then the light from the approaching star struck them in a blinding\nradiance of vermilion flames. Carruthers held his breath. Some\ninvisible force seemed to take possession of his body and that of the\ngirl at his side. The rocky plateau, now a boiling mass of rocks,\ndropped from under their feet. Clear, cold air enveloped their bodies.\nThen with the speed of light their bodies were hurled through\nplanetary space, up, up, up into the vast reaches of the higher ether.\n\nDarkness assailed them. The flames from the jungle fire vanished into\nnothingness. The electron moon paled to the size of a pin point, then\nwent out.\n\nCarruthers had the feeling of expansion and growth. It was as if his\nbody was taking on the size of the whole world. It seemed to last for\nhours, days, ages. But all the while he clung fast to the slender,\nquivering body of Nanette.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMountains and hills suddenly blazed before his eyes. Straight up and\ndown mountains. He tried to stir his sluggish mind into action. What\ndid they mean? Where had he seen them before? And while yet his mind\nstruggled with the problem the mountains dwindled like melting snow.\nThe pressure around his body relaxed. A blinding glare of steady light\nplayed upon his face. Then all was quietness and peace.\n\n\"Nan! Aaron!\" The voice was Karl's.\n\nDazedly they looked around. What had once been mountains were now\ndesks and chairs. They were back again in the laboratory. Several\nagonizing minutes passed before either could grasp the startling\nchange in things. The horror of the electronic disaster still filled\ntheir minds to overflowing.\n\nCarruthers recovered first. He stepped from the railed inclosure\nmarking the spot where the atomic beam had restored them after their\nspace flight, and guided the girl to a chair. Karl's face was drawn\nand white as his eyes rested on the two pitiful figures that had\nmaterialized out of the ether.\n\n\"Don't ask us any questions yet,\" spoke Carruthers in a tired voice.\n\"We've passed through too many horrors. What was the matter, Karl?\nCouldn't you get the rays to work sooner?\"\n\n\"Sooner?\" Danzig's eyes were wide with wonder. He glanced at his\nwatch. \"It was a little difficult to control both machines all alone,\nbut I switched off the ray from the inverse dimensional tubes and\nturned on the other immediately. All in all it must have taken me\nfifteen seconds.\"\n\n\"Fifteen seconds,\" repeated Carruthers, dazedly. \"It's unbelievable.\"\nHe dropped wearily into a chair and rested his forehead in the palms\nof his hands. \"How long have we been gone, Nan?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNanette pulled the ragged remnants of a dress around her knees and\nattempted a smile. \"Almost four months, according to the passage of\ntime on the electron.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" whispered Danzig, shutting his eyes to the truth.\n\nAaron Carruthers pointed to his clothes, now ragged and torn. \"Look,\nKarl! Everything I have on is worn out completely. Observe my hair and\nbeard, and the soles of my shoes. Human reason to the contrary,\nNanette and I have lived like two animals for four months, and all in\nthe space of fifteen seconds earth time. How can you account for it?\nWe figured it out on paper. And we've proved it with our bodies. What\nit will mean to future civilization I can't foretell. It's beyond\nimagination.\"\n\nAnd the laboratory became silent as a tomb as the three people tried\nwith all the strength of their minds to grasp the miracle of the\nstrange and unfathomable atomic rays.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nPRODUCING HEAT BY ARCTIC COLD\n\nProducing heat by means of Arctic cold is a fantastic but none the\nless quite practicable idea evolved by Dr. H. Barjou of the French\nAcademy of Science. Dr. Barjou says the water under the ice in the\nArctic region is about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. While the air is many\ndegrees less, there may even be a difference of 50 degrees. The\nunfrozen water could be pumped into a tank and permitted to freeze,\nthus generating heat, as freezing a cubic meter of ice liberates about\nas much heat as burning twenty-two pounds of coal. The heat produced\nwould vaporize a volatile hydrocarbon which would drive a turbine.\nFor condensing the hydrocarbon again, Dr. Barjou says great blocks of\nbrine could be used.\n\nNot only would the Arctic regions become comfortably habitable by\nmeans of this utilization of energy, contends Dr. Barjou, but heat\nalso could be furnished for the rest of the world.\n\nNow if some one only can discover how to make the Sahara Desert send\nforth cooling waves, the world will be perfect, temperaturally.\n\n\n\n\nJetta of the Lowlands\n\nPART TWO OF A THREE-PART NOVEL\n\n_By Ray Cummings_\n\n[Illustration: We were invisible!]\n\n[Sidenote: Into remote Lowlands, in an invisible flyer, go Grant and\nJetta--prisoners of a scientific depth bandit.]\n\nWHAT HAS GONE BEFORE\n\n\nIn the year 2020 the oceans have long since drained from the surface\nof the earth, leaving bared to sun and wind the one-time sea floor.\nMuch of it is flat, caked ooze, cracked and hardened, with, here and\nthere, small scum-covered lakes, bordered by slimy rocks. It is hot,\ndown in the depth of the great Lowland areas, and it is chiefly\nadventurers and outcasts of human kind who can endure life in what\nfew towns there are.\n\nInto Nareda, the capital village of the tiny Lowland Republic of\nNareda, goes Philip Grant, an operative of the United States Customs\nDepartment, on a dangerous assignment--to ferret out the men who are\nsmuggling mercury into the United States from that place.\n\nGrant falls in love with Jetta, the daughter of Jacob Spawn, a big\nmercury mine owner of Nareda, only to learn that Spawn has promised\nher in marriage to Greko Perona, the country's Minister of Internal\nAffairs.\n\nGrant follows Perona to a midnight Lowland rendezvous with mysterious\nstrangers and eavesdrops on them, sending their indistinct voice\nmurmurs to his chief, Hanley, in Washington, who relays them back to\nhim, amplified. He learns several important things: that Spawn and\nPerona and a depth bandit named De Boer are together involved in the\nsmuggling; that they have planned a fake robbery of a fortune in\nradiumized mercury stored at Spawn's mine, to collect the insurance on\nit and escape paying the Government export fee: and that they, plan\nto kidnap Grant for ransom.\n\nThe plotters learn of Grant's absence from Nareda, and suspect that he\nmay be nearby. They start to search for him. Grant barely escapes,\nwith the bandits and conspirators in hot pursuit. He flees to Jetta,\nhoping that they will be able to get away together: but he finds her\ntied hand and foot in her room.\n\nThe door is tightly sealed.\n\nAnd close behind him are his pursuers!\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_Jetta's Defiance_\n\nI must go back now to picture what befell Jetta that afternoon while I\nwas at Spawn's mine. It is not my purpose to becloud this narrative\nwith mystery. There was very little mystery about it to Jetta, and I\ncan reconstruct her viewpoint of the events from what she afterward\ntold me.\n\nJetta's room was in a wing of the house on the side near the pergola.\nHer window and door looked out upon the patio. When I had\nretired--that first night in Nareda--Spawn had gone to his daughter\nand upbraided her for showing herself while he was giving me that\nfirst midnight meal.\n\n\"You stay in your room: you have nothing to do with him. Hear me?\"\n\n\"Yes, Father.\"\n\nFrom her infancy he had dominated her; it never occurred to either of\nthem that she could disobey. And yet, this time she did; for no sooner\nwas he asleep that night than she came to my window as I have told.\n\nThis next day Jetta dutifully had kept herself secluded. She cooked\nher own breakfast while I was at the Government House, and was again\nout of sight by noon.\n\nJetta was nearly always alone. I can picture her sitting there within\nthe narrow walls of her little room. Boy's ragged garb. All possible\nfemininity stripped from her. Yet, within her, the woman's instincts\nwere struggling. She sewed a great deal, she since has told me, there\nin the cloistered dimness. Making little dresses of silk and bits of\nfinery given her surreptitiously by the neighbor women. Gazing at\nherself in them with the aid of a tiny mirror. Hiding them away, never\ndaring to wear them openly; until at intervals her father would raid\nthe room, find them and burn them in the kitchen incinerator.\n\n\"Instincts of Satan! By damn but I will get these woman's instincts\nout of you, Jetta!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd there were hours when she would try to read hidden books, and look\nat pictures of the strange fairy world of the Highlands. She could\nread and write a little: she had gone for a few years to the small\nNareda government school, and then been snatched from it by her\nfather.\n\nWhen Spawn and I had finished that noonday meal, I recall that he left\nme for a moment. He had gone to Jetta.\n\n\"I am taking that young American to the mine. I will return presently.\nStay close, Jetta.\"\n\n\"Yes, Father.\"\n\nHe left with me. Jetta remained in her room, her thoughts upon the\ncoming night. She trembled at them. She would meet me again, this\nevening in the moonlit garden....\n\nThe sound of a man walking the garden path aroused her from her\nreverie. Then came a soft ingratiating voice:\n\n\"Jetta, _chica Mia_!\"\n\nIt was Perona, standing by the pergola preening his effeminate\nmustache.\n\n\"Jetta, little love bird, come out and talk to me.\"\n\nJetta slammed the window slide and sat quiet.\n\n\"Jetta, it is your Greko.\"\n\n\"Well do I know it,\" she muttered.\n\n\"Jetta!\" He strode down the path and back. \"Jetta.\" His voice began\nrising into a strident, peevish anger.\n\n\"Jetta, are you in there? _Chica_, answer me.\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"Jetta, _por Dios_--\" He fumed, then fell to pleading. \"Are you in\nthere? Please, little love bird, answer your Greko. Are you in there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Come out then. Come to Greko.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe said sweetly. \"My father does not want me to talk to men. You know\nthat is so, Se\u00f1or Perona.\"\n\nIt grounded him. \"Why--\"\n\n\"Is it not so?\"\n\n\"Y-yes, but I am not--\"\n\n\"A man?\" Little imp! She relished impaling him upon the shafts of her\nridicule. Her sport was interrupted by the arrival of Spawn. He had\nleft me at the mine and come directly back home. Jetta heard his heavy\ntread on the garden path, then his voice:\n\n\"Ah, Perona.\"\n\nAnd Perona: \"Jetta will not come out and talk to me.\" The waxen\nmustached Minister of Nareda's Internal Affairs was like a sulky\nchild. But Spawn was unimpressed. Spawn said:\n\n\"Well, let her alone. We have more important things to engage us. I\nhave the American occupied at the mine. You heard from De Boer?\"\n\n\"I went last night. All is ready as we planned. But Spawn, this fool\nof an American, this Grant--\"\n\n\"Hush! Not so loud, Perona!\"\n\n\"I am telling you--!\" Perona was excited. His voice rose shrilly, but\nSpawn checked him.\n\n\"Shut up: you waste time. Tell me exactly the arrangements with De\nBoer. _Le grand coup_! now; to-night most important of nights--and you\nrant of your troubles with a girl!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were standing by the pergola, quite near Jetta's shaded window.\nShe crouched there, listening to them. None of this was entirely new\nto Jetta. She had always been aware more or less of her father's\nsecret business activities. As a child she had not understood them.\nNor did she now, with any clarity. Spawn, had always talked freely\nwithin her hearing, ignoring her, though occasionally he threatened\nher to keep her mouth shut.\n\nShe heard now fragments of this discussion between her father and\nPerona. They moved away from the pergola and sat by the fountain,\nspeaking too low for her to hear. And then they paced the path, coming\nnearer, and she caught their voices again. And occasionally they grew\nexcited, or vehement, and then their raised tones were plainly audible\nto her.\n\nAnd this that she heard, with what she knew already, and with what\nsubsequently transpired, enables me now to piece together the facts\ninto a connected explanation.\n\nIn the establishment of his cinnabar mine some years before, Spawn was\noriginally financed by Perona. The South American was then newly made\nMinister of Nareda's Internal Affairs. He became Spawn's business\npartner. They kept the connection secret. Spawn falsified his\nproduction records; and Perona with his governmental position was\nenabled to pass these false accounts of the mine's production. Nareda\nwas systematically cheated of a portion of its legal share.\n\nBut this, after a time, did not satisfy the ambitious Perona and\nSpawn. They began to plan how they might engage in smuggling some of\ntheir quicksilver into the United States.\n\nPerona, during these years, had had ambitions of his own in other\ndirections. President Markes, of Nareda, was an honest official. He\nhandicapped Perona considerably. There were many ways by which Perona\ncould have grown rich through a dishonest handling of the government\naffairs. It was done almost universally in all the small Latin\ngovernments. But Markes as President made it dangerous in Nareda. Even\nthe duplicity with the mine was a precarious affair.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was at this time in Nareda a young adventurer named De Boer. A\nhandsome, swaggering fellow in his late twenties. He was a good\ntalker; he spoke many languages; he could orate with fluency and\nskilful guile. His smile, his colorful personality, and his gift for\noratory, made it easy for him to stir up dissatisfaction among the\npeople.\n\nDe Boer became known as a patriot. A revolution in Nareda was brewing.\nPerona, as Nareda's Minister, was De Boer's political enemy. The\nNareda Government ran De Boer out, ending the potential revolution.\nBut Perona and Spawn had always secretly been friends with De Boer. It\nwould have been very handy to have this unscrupulous young scoundrel\nas President.\n\nWhen De Boer was banished with some of his most loyal followers, he\nbegan a career of petty banditry in the Lowland's depths. Spawn and\nPerona kept in communication with him, and, by a method which was\npresently made startlingly clear to Jetta and me, De Boer smuggled the\nquicksilver for Perona and Spawn. It was this activity which had\nfinally aroused my department and caused Hanley to send me to Nareda.\n\nThis however, was a dangerous, precarious occupation. De Boer did not\nseem to think so, or care. But Perona and Spawn, with their\nestablished positions in Nareda, were always fearful of exposure. Even\nwithout my coming, they had planned to disconnect from De Boer.\n\n\"And for more than that,\" as Jetta had one day heard Perona remark to\nher father. \"I'll tell to you that this De Boer is not very straight\nwith us, Spawn.\" De Boer would, upon occasion, fail to make proper\nreturn for the smuggled product.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo now they had planned a last coup in which De Boer was to help, and\nthen they would be done with him: the two of them, Spawn and Perona,\nwould remain as honest citizens of Nareda, and De Boer had agreed to\ntake himself away and pursue his banditry elsewhere.\n\nIt was a simple plan; it promised to yield a high stake quickly. A\nfinal fling at illicit activity; then virtuous reformation, with\nPerona marrying the little Jetta.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeneath the strong room at the mine, Perona and Spawn had secretly\nbuilt a cleverly concealed little vault. De Boer, this night just\nbefore the midnight hour, was to attack the mine. Spawn and Perona had\nbribed the police guards to submit to this attack. The guards did not\nknow the details: they only knew that De Boer and his men would make a\nsham attack, careful to harm none of them--and then De Boer would\nwithdraw. The guards would report that they had been driven away by a\nlarge force. And when the excitement was over, the ingots of\nradiumized quicksilver would have vanished!\n\nDe Boer, making away into distant Lowland fastnesses, would obviously\nbe supposed to have taken the treasure. But Perona, hidden alone in\nthe strong-room, would merely carry the ingots down into the secret\nvault, to be disposed of at some future date. The ingots were well\ninsured, by an international company, against theft. The Nareda\ngovernment would receive one-third of that insurance as recompense for\nthe loss of its share. Perona and Spawn would get two-thirds--and have\nthe treasure as well.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuch was the present plan, into which, all unknown to me, I had been\nplunged. And my presence complicated things considerably. So much so\nthat Perona grew vehement, this afternoon in the garden, explaining\nwhy. His shrill voice carried clearly to Jetta, in spite of Spawn's\nefforts to shut him up.\n\n\"I tell to you that Americano agent will undo us.\"\n\n\"How?\" demanded the calmer Spawn.\n\n\"Already he has made Markes suspicious.\"\n\n\"Chut! You can befool Markes, Perona. You have for years been doing\nit.\"\n\n\"This meddling fellow, he has met Jetta!\"\n\n\"I do not believe it.\" There was a sudden grimness to Spawn's tone at\nthe thought. \"I do not believe it. Jetta would not dare.\"\n\n\"You should have seen him flush when Markes mentioned at the\nconference this morning that I am to marry Jetta. No one could miss\nit. He has met her--I tell it to you--and it must have been last\nnight.\"\n\n\"So, you say?\" Jetta could see her father's face, white with\nsuppressed rage. \"You think that? And it is that this Grant might be\nyour rival, that worries you? Not our plans for to-night, which have\nreal importance--but worrying over a girl.\"\n\n\"She would not talk to me. She would not come out. He has no doubt put\nwild ideas into her head. Spawn, you listen to me. I have always been\nmore clever than you at scheming. Is it not so? You have always said\nit. I have a plan now, it fits our arrangements with De Boer, but it\nwill rid us of this Americano. When all is done and I have married\nJetta--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpawn interrupted impatiently. \"You will marry Jetta, never fear. I\nhave promised her to you.\"\n\nAnd because, as Jetta well knew, Perona had made it part of his\nbargaining in financing Spawn. But this they did not now mention.\n\n\"To get rid of this Grant--well, that sounds meritorious. He is\ndangerous around here. To that I agree.\"\n\n\"And with Jetta--\"\n\n\"Have done, Perona!\" With sudden decision Spawn leaped to his feet. \"I\ndo not believe she would have dared talk to Grant. We'll have her out\nand ask her. If she has, by the gods--\"\n\nIt fell upon Jetta before she had time to gather her wits. Spawn\nstrode to her door, and found it fastened on the inside.\n\n\"Jetta, open at once!\"\n\nHe thumped with his heavy fists. Confused and trembling she unsealed\nit, and he dragged her out into the sunlight of the garden.\n\n\"Now then, Jetta, you have heard some of what we have been saying,\nperhaps?\"\n\n\"Father--\"\n\n\"About this young American? This Grant?\"\n\nShe stood cringing in his grasp. Spawn had never used physical\nviolence with Jetta. But he was white with fury now.\n\n\"Father, you--you are hurting me.\"\n\nPerona interposed. \"Wait Spawn! Not so rough! Let me talk to her.\nJetta, _chica mia_, your Greko is worried--\"\n\n\"To the hell with that!\" Spawn shouted. But he released the girl and\nshe sank trembling to the little seat by the pergola.\n\nSpawn stood over her. \"Jetta, look at me! Did you meet--did you talk\nto Grant last night?\"\n\nShe wanted to deny it. She clung to his angry gaze. But the habit of\nall her life of truthfulness with him prevailed.\n\n\"Y-yes,\" she admitted.\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_Trapped_\n\n\"Spawn! Hold!\"\n\nThere was an instant when it seemed that Spawn would strike the girl.\nThe blood drained from his face, leaving his dark eyes blazing like\ntorches. His hamlike fist went back, but Perona sprang for him and\nclutched him.\n\n\"Hold, Spawn: I will talk to her. Jetta, so you did--\"\n\nThe torrent of emotion swept Spawn; weakened him so that instead of\nstriking Jetta, he yielded to Perona's clutch and dropped his arm. For\na moment he stood gazing at his daughter.\n\n\"Is it so? And all my efforts, going for nothing, just like your\nmother!\" He no more than murmured it, and as Perona pushed him, he\nsank to the bench beside Jetta. But did not touch her, just sat\nstaring. And she stared back, both of then aghast at the enormity of\nthis, her first disobedience.\n\nI never had opportunity to know Spawn, except for the few times which\nI have mentioned. Perhaps he was at heart a pathetic figure. I think,\nlooking back on it now that Spawn is dead, that there was a pathos to\nhim. Spawn had loved his wife, Jetta's mother. As a young man he had\nbrought her to the Lowlands to seek his fortune. And when Jetta was an\ninfant, his wife had left him. Run away, abandoning him and their\nchild.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPerhaps Spawn was never mentally normal after that. He had reared\nJetta with the belief that sin was inherent in all females. It\nobsessed him. Warped and twisted all his outlook as he brooded on it\nthrough the years. Woman's instincts; woman's love of pleasure, pretty\nclothes--all could lead only to sin.\n\nAnd so he had kept Jetta secluded. He had fought what he seemed to see\nin her as she grew and flowered into girlhood, and denied her\neverything which he thought might make her like her mother.\n\nSpawn met his death within a few hours of this afternoon I am\ndescribing. Perhaps he was no more than a scheming scoundrel. We are\ninstinctively lenient with our appraisal of the dead. I do not know.\n\n\"Jetta,\" Perona said to her accusingly, \"that is true, then: you did\ntalk with that miserable Americano last night? You sinful, lying\ngirl.\"\n\nThe contrition within Jetta at disobeying her father faded before this\nattack.\n\n\"I am not sinful.\" The trembling left her and she sat up and faced the\naccusing Perona. \"I did but talk to him. You speak lies when you say I\nam sinful.\"\n\n\"You hear, Spawn? Defiant: already changed from the little Jetta I--\"\n\n\"Yes, I am changed. I do not love you, Se\u00f1or Perona. I think I hate\nyou.\" Her tears were very close, but she finished: \"I--I won't marry\nyou. I won't!\"\n\nIt stung Spawn. He leaped to his feet. \"So you talk like that! It has\ngone so far as this, has it? Get to your room! We will see what you\nwill and what you won't!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain the crafty Perona was calmest of them all. He thrust himself in\nfront of Spawn.\n\n\"Jetta, to-night you plan to see him again, no? To-night?--here?\"\n\n\"No,\" she stammered.\n\n\"You lie!\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You lie! Spawn look at her! Lying! She has planned to meet him\nto-night! That is all we want to know.\" He broke into a cackling\nchuckle. \"That fits my new plan, Spawn. A tryst with Jetta, here in\nthe garden.\"\n\n\"Get to your room,\" Spawn growled. He dragged her back, and Perona\nfollowed them.\n\n\"You lie there.\" Spawn flung her to her couch. \"After this night's\nwork is done, we'll see whether you will or you won't.\"\n\n\"She may not stay in here.\" Perona suggested.\n\n\"She will stay.\"\n\n\"You seal her in?\"\n\n\"I will seal her in.\"\n\nPerona's eyes roved the little bedroom. One window oval and a door,\nboth overlooking the patio.\n\n\"But suppose she should get out? There is no way to seal that window\nproperly from outside. A cord!\"\n\nA long stout silken tassel-cord had been draped by Jetta at the window\ncurtain. Perona snatched it down.\n\n\"If her ankles and wrists were tied with this--\"\n\n\"No!\" burst out Jetta. And then a fear for me rushed over her. A\nrealization, forgotten in the stress of this conflict with her\nfather, now swept over her. They were planning harm to me.\n\n\"No, do not bind me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA sudden caution came to her. She was making it worse for me. Already\nshe had done me immense harm.\n\nShe said suddenly, \"Do what you like with me. I was wrong. I have no\ninterest in that American. It is you, Greko, I--I love.\"\n\nSpawn did not heed her. Perona insisted, \"I would tie her with care.\"\n\nHe helped Spawn rope her ankles, and then her wrists, crossed behind\nher.\n\n\"A little gag, Spawn? She might cry out: we want no interference\nto-night.\" He was ready with a large silken handkerchief. They thrust\nit into her mouth and tied it behind her neck.\n\n\"There,\" growled Spawn. \"You will and you won't: we shall see about\nthat. Lie still, Jetta. If I have need to come again to you--\"\n\nThey left her. And this time she heard them less clearly. But there\nwere fragments:\n\nPerona: \"I will meet him again. After dark, to-night. Yes, he expects\nme. For his money, Spawn, his pay in advance. This De Boer works not\nfor nothing.\"\n\nSpawn: \"You will arrange about your police on the streets? He can get\nhere to my house safely?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, at the tri-evening hour, certainly before midnight, before\nthe attack on the mine. You must stay here, Spawn. Pretend to be\nasleep: it will lure the fool Americano out in to the moonlight.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJetta could piece it together fairly well. They would have De Boer\ncome and abduct me. Not tell him I was a government agent, with the\nmicro-safety alarm which they suspected I carried, but just tell De\nBoer that I was a rich American, who could be abducted and held for a\nbig ransom.\n\nPerona's voice rose with a fragment: \"If he springs his alarm, here in\nthe moonlight, you can be here, Spawn, and pretend to try and rescue\nhim. A radio-image of that flashed to Hanley's office will exonerate\nus of suspicion.\"\n\nPerona would promise De Boer that the Nareda government would pay the\nransom quickly, collecting it later from the United States.\n\nSpawn said, \"You think De Boer will believe that?\"\n\n\"Why should he not? I am skilful at persuasion, no? Let him find out\nlater that the United States Government trackers are after him!\"\nPerona cackled at the thought of it. \"What of that? Let him kill this\nGrant. All the better.\"\n\nSpawn said abruptly: \"The United States may catch De Boer. Have you\nthought of that, Perona? The fellow would not shield us, but would\ntell everything.\"\n\n\"And who will believe him? The wild tale of a trapped bandit! Against\nyour word, Spawn? You, an honest and wealthy mine owner? And I--I,\nGreko Perona, Minister of Internal Affairs of the Sovereign Power of\nNareda! Who will dare to give me the lie because a bandit tells a wild\ntale with no real facts to prop it?\"\n\n\"Those police guards at the mine to-night?\"\n\n\"Admit that they took your bribes? You are witless, Spawn! Let them\nbut admit it to me and of a surety I will fling them into\nimprisonment! Now listen with care, for the after noon is going....\"\n\nTheir voices lowered, then faded, and Jetta was left alone and\nhelpless. Spawn went back to the mine to meet me. We returned and had\nsupper, Jetta could dimly hear us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was silence about the house during the mid-evening. I had\nslipped out and followed Perona to his meeting with De Boer. Then\nSpawn had discovered my absence and had rushed to join Perona and\ntell him.\n\nBut Jetta knew nothing of this. The hour of her tryst with me was\napproaching. In the darkness of her room as she lay bound and gagged\non her couch, she could see the fitful moonlight rising to illumine\nthe window oval.\n\nShe squirmed at the cords holding her, but could not loosen them. They\ncut into her flesh; her limbs were numb.\n\nThe evening wore on. Would I come to the garden tryst?\n\nJetta could not break her bonds. But gradually she had mouthed the gag\nloose. Then she heard my hurried footsteps in the patio; then my tense\nvoice.\n\nAnd at her answer I was pounding on her door. But it had been stoutly\nsealed by Spawn. I flung my shoulder against it, raging, thumping. But\nthe heavy metal panels would not yield; the seal held intact.\n\n\"Jetta!\"\n\n\"Philip, run away! They want to catch you! De Boer, the bandit, is\ncoming!\"\n\n\"I know it!\"\n\nFool that I was, to pause with talk! There was no time: I must get\nJetta out of here. Break down this door.\n\nBut it would not yield. A gas torch would melt this outer seal. Was\nthere a torch here at Spawn's? But I had no time to search for a\ntorch! Or a bar with which to ram this door--\n\nA panic seized me, with the fresh realization that any instant De Boer\nand his men would arrive. I beat with futile fists on the door, and\nJetta from within, calling to me to get away before I was caught.\n\nThis accursed door between us!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then--after no more than half a minute, doubtless--I thought of\nthe window. My momentary panic left me. I dashed to the window oval.\nSealed. But the shutter curtain, and the glassite pane behind it, were\nfragile.\n\n\"Jetta, are you near the window?\"\n\n\"No. On the bed. They have tied me.\"\n\n\"Look out; I'm breaking through!\"\n\nThere were loose rocks, as large as my head, set to mark the garden\npath. I seized one and hurled it. With a crash it went through the\nwindow and fell to the floor of the room. A jagged hole showed.\n\n\"All right, Jetta?\"\n\n\"Yes! Yes, Philip.\"\n\nI squirmed through the oval and dropped to the floor. My arms were cut\nfrom the jagged glassite, though I did not know it then. It was dim\ninside the room, but I could see the outline of the bed with her lying\non it.\n\nHer ankles and wrists were tied. I cut the cords with my knife.\n\nShe was gasping. \"They're planning to capture you. Philip! You should\nnot be here! Get away!\"\n\n\"Yes. But I'm going to take you with me. Can you stand up?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI set her on her feet in the center of the room. A shaft of moonlight\nwas coming through the hole in the window.\n\n\"Philip! You're bleeding!\"\n\n\"It is nothing. Cut myself on the glassite. Can you stand alone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nBut her legs, stiffened and numb from having been bound so many hours,\nbent under her. I caught her as she was falling.\n\n\"I'll be--all right in a minute. But Philip, if you stay here--\"\n\n\"You're going with me!\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\nI could carry her, if she could not run. But it would be slow; and it\nwould be difficult to get her through the window. And on the street we\nwould attract too much attention.\n\n\"Jetta, try to stand. Stamp your feet. I'll hold you.\"\n\nI steadied her. Then I bent down, chafing her legs with my hands. Her\narms had been limp, but the blood was in them now. She murmured with\nthe tingling pain, and then bent over, frantically helping me rub the\ncirculation back into her legs.\n\n\"Better?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She took a weak and trembling step.\n\n\"Wait. Let me rub them more, Jetta.\"\n\nPrecious minutes!\n\n\"I'll knock out the rest of the window with that rock! We'll run;\nwe'll be out of here in a moment.\"\n\n\"Run where?\"\n\n\"Away. Into hiding--out of all this. The United States patrol-ship is\ncoming from Porto Rico. It will take us from here.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Away. To Great New York, maybe. Away from all this; from that old\nfossil, Perona.\"\n\nI was stooping beside her.\n\n\"I'm all right now, Philip.\"\n\nI rose up, and suddenly found myself clasping her in my arms; her\nslight body in the boy's ragged garb pressed against me.\n\n\"Jetta, dear, do you trust me? Will you come?\"\n\n\"Yes. Oh, yes--anywhere, Philip, with you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor only a breathless instant I lingered, holding her. Then I cast her\noff and seized the rock from the floor. The jagged glassite fell away\nunder my blows.\n\n\"Now, Jetta. I'll go first--\"\n\nBut it was too late! I stopped, stricken by the sound of a voice\noutside!\n\n\"He's there! In the girl's room! That's her window!\"\n\nCautious voices in the garden! The thud of approaching footsteps.\n\nI shoved Jetta back and rushed to the broken window oval. The figures\nof De Boer and his men showed in the moonlight across the patio. They\nhad heard me breaking the glassite. And they saw me, now.\n\n\"There he is, De Boer!\"\n\nWe were trapped!\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_The Murder in the Garden_\n\n\"Hans, keep back! I will go!\"\n\n\"But Commander--\"\n\n\"Armed? The hell he is not! Spawn said no. Spawn! Where is Spawn? He\nwas here.\"\n\nI had dropped back from the window, and, gripping Jetta, stood in the\ncenter of the room.\n\n\"Jetta, dear.\"\n\n\"Oh. Philip!\"\n\n\"There's no other way out of here?\"\n\n\"No! No!\"\n\nOnly the heavy sealed door, and this broken window. The bandits in the\ngarden had paused at sight of me. Someone had called.\n\n\"He may be armed, De Boer.\"\n\nThey had stopped their forward rush and darted into the shelter of the\npergola. I might be armed!\n\nWe could hear their low voices not ten feet from us. But I was not\narmed, except for my knife. Futile weapon, indeed.\n\n\"Jetta, keep back. If they should fire--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI got a look through the oval. De Boer was advancing upon it, with his\nbarreled projector half levelled. He saw me again. He called:\n\n\"You American, come out!\"\n\nI crouched on the floor, pushing Jetta back to where the shadows of\nthe bed hid her.\n\n\"You American!\"\n\nHe was close outside the window. \"Come out--or I am coming in!\"\n\nI said abruptly, \"Come!\"\n\nMy blade was in my hand. If he showed himself I could slash his\nthroat, doubtless. But what about Jetta? My thoughts flashed upon the\nheels of my defiant invitation. Suppose, as De Boer climbed in the\nwindow, I killed him? I could not escape, and his infuriated fellows\nwould rush us, firing through the oval, sweeping the room, killing us\nboth. But Jetta now was in no danger. Her father was outside, and\nthese bandits were her father's friends. I would have to yield.\n\nI called, louder, \"Why don't you come in?\"\n\nCould I hold them off? Frighten them off, for a time, and make enough\nnoise so that perhaps someone passing in the nearby street would give\nthe alarm and bring help?\n\nThere was a sudden silence in the patio. The bandits had so far made\nas little commotion as possible. Presently I could hear their low\nvoices.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI heard an oath. De Boer's head and shoulders appeared in the window\noval! His levelled projector came through. Perhaps he would not have\nfired, but I did not dare take the chance. I was crouching almost\nunder the muzzle, so I straightened, gripped it, and flung it up. I\nthen slashed at his face with my knife, but he gripped my wrist with\npowerful fingers. My knife fell as he twisted my wrist. His projector\nhad not fired. It was jammed between us. One of his huge arms reached\nin and encircled me.\n\n\"Damn you!\"\n\nHe muttered it, but I shouted, \"Fool! De Boer, the bandit!\"\n\nI was aware of a commotion out in the garden.\n\n\"... Bring all Nareda on our ears? De Boer, shut him up!\"\n\nI was gripping the projector, struggling to keep its muzzle pointed\nupwards. With a heave of his giant arms De Boer lifted me and jerked\nme bodily through the window. I fell on my feet, still fighting. But\nother hands seized me. It was no use. I yielded suddenly. I panted:\n\n\"Enough!\"\n\nThey held me. One of them growled. \"Another shout and we will leave\nyou here dead. Commander, _look_!\"\n\nMy shirt was torn open. The electrode band about my chest was exposed!\nDe Boer towered head and shoulders over me. I gazed up, passive in the\ngrip of two or three of his men, and saw his face. His heavy jaw\ndropped as he gazed at my little diaphragms, the electrode.\n\nHe knew now for the first time that this was no private citizen he had\nassaulted. This official apparatus meant that I was a Government\nagent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was an instant of shocked silence. An expression grim and\nfurious crossed the giant bandit's face.\n\n\"So this is it? Hans, careful--hold him!\"\n\nJetta was still in her room, silent now. I heard Spawn's voice, close\nat hand in the patio.\n\n\"De Boer! Careful!\" It was the most cautious of half-whispers.\n\nAbruptly someone reached for my chest; jerked at the electrode; tore\nits fragile wires--the tiny grids and thumbnail amplifiers; jerked and\nripped and flung the whole little apparatus to the garden path. But it\nsang its warning note as the wires broke. Up in Great New York Hanley\nknew then that catastrophe had fallen upon me.\n\nFor a brief instant the crestfallen bandit mumbled at what he had\ndone. Then came Spawn's voice:\n\n\"Got him, De Boer? Good!\"\n\nTriumphant Spawn! He advanced across the garden with his heavy tread.\nAnd to me, and I am sure to De Boer as well, there came the swift\nrealization that Spawn had been hiding safely in the background. But\nmy detector was smashed now. It might have imaged De Boer assailing\nme: but now that it was smashed, Spawn could act freely.\n\n\"Good! So you have him! Make away to the mine!\"\n\nI did not see De Boer's face at that instant. But I saw his weapon\ncome up--an act wholly impulsive, no doubt. A flash of fury!\n\nHe levelled the projector, not at me, but at the on-coming Spawn.\n\n\"You damn liar!\"\n\n\"De Boer--\" It was a scream of terror from Spawn. But it came too\nlate. The projector hissed; spat its tiny blue puff. The needle\ndrilled Spawn through the heart. He toppled, flung up his arms, and\nwent down, silently, to sprawl on his face across the garden path.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDe Boer was cursing, startled at his own action. The men holding me\ntightened their grip. I heard Jetta cry out, but not at what had\nhappened in the garden: she was unaware of that. One of the bandits\nhad left the group and climbed into her room. Her cry now was\nsuppressed, as though the man's hand went over her mouth. And in the\nsilence came his mumbled voice:\n\n\"Shut up, you!\"\n\nThere was the sound of a scuffle in there. I tore at the men holding\nme.\n\n\"Let me go! Jetta! Come out!\"\n\nDe Boer dashed for the window. I was still struggling. A hand cuffed\nme in the face. A projector rammed into my side.\n\n\"Stop it, fool American!\"\n\nDe Boer came back with a chastened bandit ahead of him. The man was\nmuttering and rubbing his shoulder, and De Boer said:\n\n\"Try anything like that again, Cartner, and I won't be so easy on\nyou.\"\n\nDe Boer was dragging Jetta, holding her by a wrist. She looked like a\nterrified, half-grown boy, so small was she beside this giant. But the\nwoman's lines of her, and the long dark hair streaming about her white\nface and over her shoulders, were unmistakable.\n\n\"His daughter.\" De Boer was chuckling. \"The little Jetta.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll this had happened in certainly no more than five minutes. I\nrealized that no alarm had been raised: the bandits had managed it all\nwith reasonable quiet.\n\nThere were six of the bandits here, and De Boer, who towered over us\nall. I saw him now as a swaggering giant of thirty-odd, with a\nheavy-set smooth-shaved, handsome face.\n\nHe held Jetta off. \"Damn, how you have grown, Jetta.\"\n\nSomeone said, \"She knows too much.\"\n\nAnd someone else, \"We will take her with us. If you leave her here, De\nBoer--\"\n\n\"Why should I leave her? Why? Leave her--for Perona?\"\n\nThen I think that for the first time Jetta saw her father's body lying\nsprawled on the path. She cried, \"Philip!\" Then she half turned and\nmurmured: \"Father!\"\n\nShe wavered, almost falling. \"Father--\" She went down, fainting,\nfalling half against me and against De Boer, who caught her slight\nbody in his arms.\n\n\"Come, we'll get back. Drag him!\"\n\n\"But you can't carry that girl out like that, De Boer.\"\n\n\"Into the house: there is an open door. Hans, go out and bring the car\naround to this side. Give me the cloaks. There is no alarm yet.\"\n\nDe Boer chuckled again. \"Perona was nice to keep the police off this\nstreet to-night!\"\n\nWe went into the kitchen. An auto-car, which to the village people\nmight have been there on Spawn's mining business, slid quietly up to\nthe side entrance. A cloak was thrown over Jetta. She was carried like\na sack and put into the car.\n\nI suddenly found an opportunity to break loose. I leaped and struck\none of the men. But the others were too quickly on me. The kitchen\ntable went over with a crash.\n\nThen something struck me on the back of the head: I think it was the\nhandle of De Boer's great knife. The kitchen and the men struggling\nwith me faded. I went into a roaring blackness.\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n_Aboard the Bandit Flyer_\n\nI was dimly conscious of being inside the cubby of the car, with\nbandits sitting over me. The car was rolling through the village\nstreets. Ascending. We must be heading for Spawn's mine. I thought of\nJetta. Then I heard her voice and felt her stir beside me.\n\nThe roaring in my head made everything dreamlike. I sank half into\nunconsciousness again. It seemed an endless interval, with only the\nmuttering hiss of the car's mechanism and the confused murmurs of the\nbandits' voices.\n\nThen my strength came. The cold sweat on me was drying in the night\nbreeze that swept through the car as it climbed the winding ascent. I\ncould see through its side oval a vista of bloated Lowland crags with\nmoonlight on them.\n\nIt seemed that we should be nearly to the mine. We stopped. The men in\nthe car began climbing out.\n\nDe Boer's voice: \"Is he conscious now? I'll take the girl.\"\n\nSomeone bent over me. \"You hear me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\nI found myself outside the car. They held me on my feet. Someone\ngratuitously cuffed me, but De Boer's voice issued a sharp, low-toned\nrebuke.\n\n\"Stop it! Get him and the girl aboard.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere seemed thirty or forty men gathered here. Silent dark figures in\nblack robes. The moonlight showed them, and occasionally one flashed a\nhand search-beam. It was De Boer's main party gathered to attack the\nmine.\n\nI stood wavering on my feet. I was still weak and dizzy, with a lump\non the back of my head where I had been struck. The scene about me was\nat first unfamiliar. We were in a rocky gully. Rounded broken walls.\nCaves and crevices. Dried ooze piled like a ramp up one side. The\nmoonlight struggled down through a gathering mist overhead.\n\nI saw, presently, where we were. Above the mine, not below it: and I\nrealized that the car had encircled the mine's cauldron and climbed\nto a height beyond it. Down the small gully I could see where it\nopened into the cauldron about a hundred feet below us. The lights of\nthe mine winked in the blurred moonlight shadows.\n\nThe bandits led me up the gully. The car was left standing against the\ngully side where it had halted. De Boer, or one of his men, was\ncarrying Jetta.\n\nThe flyer was here. We came upon it suddenly around a bend in the\ngully. Although I had only seen the nose if it earlier in the evening.\nI recognized this to be the same. It was in truth a strange looking\nflyer: I had never seen one quite like it. Barrel-winged, like a\nJantzen: multi-propellored: and with folding helicopters for the\nvertical lifts and descent. And a great spreading fan-tail, in the\nBritish fashion. It rested on the rocks like a fat-winged bird with\nits long cylindrical body puffed out underneath. A seventy-foot cabin:\nfifteen feet wide, possibly. A line of small window-portes; a circular\nglassite front to the forward control-observatory cubby, with the\npropellors just above it, and the pilot cubby up there behind them.\nAnd underneath the whole, a landing gear of the Fraser-Mood\nspringed-cushion type: and an expanding, air-coil pontoon-bladder for\nlanding upon water.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll this was usual enough. Yet, with the brief glimpses I had as my\ncaptors hurried me toward the landing incline, I was aware of\nsomething very strange about this flyer. It was all dead black, a\nbloated-bellied black bird. The moonlight struck it, but did not gleam\nor shimmer on its black metal surface. The cabin window-portes glowed\nwith a dim blue-gray light from inside. But as I chanced to gaze at\none a green film seemed to cross it like a shade, so that it winked\nand its light was gone. Yet a hole was there, like an eye-socket. An\nempty green hole.\n\nWe were close to the plane now, approaching the bottom of the small\nlanding-incline. The wing over my head was like a huge fat barrel cut\nlength-wise in half. I stared up; and suddenly it seemed that the wing\nwas melting. Fading. Its inner portion, where it joined the body, was\nclear in the moonlight. But the tips blurred and faded. An aspect\ncuriously leprous. Uncanny. Gruesome.\n\nThey took me up the landing-incline. A narrow vaulted corridor ran\nlength-wise of the interior, along one side of the cabin body. To my\nleft as we headed for the bow control room, the corridor window-portes\nshowed the rocks outside. To the right of the corridor, the ship's\nsmall rooms lay in a string. A metal interior. I saw almost nothing\nsave metal in various forms. Grid floor and ceiling. Sheet metal walls\nand partitions. Furnishings and fabrics, all of spun metal. And all\ndead black.\n\nWe entered the control room. The two men holding me flung me in a\nchair. I had been searched. They had taken from me the tiny, colored\nmagnesium light-flashes. How easy for the plans of men to go astray!\nHanley and I had arranged that I was to signal the Porto Rican\npatrol-ship with those flares.\n\n\"Sit quiet!\" commanded my guard.\n\nI retorted, \"If you hit me again, I won't.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDe Boer came in, carrying Jetta. He put her in a chair near me, and\nshe sat huddled tense. In the dim gray light of the control room her\nwhite face with its big staring dark eyes was turned toward me. But\nshe did not speak, nor did I.\n\nThe bandits ignored us. De Boer moved about the room, examining a bank\nof instruments. Familiar instruments, most of them. The usual\naero-controls and navigational devices. A radio audiphone transmitter\nand receiver, with its attendant eavesdropping cut-offs. And there was\nan ether-wave mirror-grid. De Boer bent over it. And then I saw him\nfastening upon his forehead an image-lens. He said:\n\n\"You stay here, Hans. You and Gutierrez. Take care of the girl and\nthis fellow Grant. Don't hurt them.\"\n\nGutierrez was a swarthy Latin American. He smiled. \"For why would I\nhurt him? You say he is worth much money to us, De Boer. And the girl,\nah--\"\n\nDe Boer towered over him. \"Just lay a finger on her and you will\nregret it, Gutierrez! You stay at your controls. Be ready. This affair\nit will take no more than half an hour.\"\n\nA man came to the control room entrance. \"You come, Commander?\"\n\n\"Yes. Right at once.\"\n\n\"The men are ready. From the mine we might almost be seen here. This\ndelay--\"\n\n\"Coming, Rausch.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut he lingered a moment more. \"Hans, my finder will show you what I\ndo. Keep watch. When we come back, have all ready for flight. This\nGrant had an alarm-detector. Heaven only knows what eavesdropping and\nrelaying he has done. And for sure there is hell now in Spawn's\ngarden. The Nareda police are there, of course. They might track us up\nhere.\"\n\nHe paused before me. \"I think I would not cause trouble, Grant.\"\n\n\"I'm not a fool.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not.\" He turned to Jetta. \"No harm will come to you. Fear\nnothing.\"\n\nHe wound his dark cloak about his giant figure and left the control\nroom. In a moment, through the rounded observing pane beside me, I saw\nhim outside on the moonlit rocks. His men gathered about him. There\nwere forty of them, possibly, with ten or so left here aboard to guard\nthe flyer.\n\nAnd in another moment the group of dark-cloaked figures outside crept\noff in single file like a slithering serpent, moving down the rock\ndefile toward where in the cauldron pit the lights of the mine shone\non its dark silent buildings.\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n_The Attack on the Mine_\n\nThere was a moment when I had an opportunity to speak with Jetta.\nGutierrez sat watchfully by the archway corridor entrance with a\nneedle projector across his knees. The fellow Hans, a big, heavy-set\nhalf-breed Dutchman with a wide-collared leather jerkin and wide,\nknee-length pantaloons, laid his weapon carefully aside and busied\nhimself with his image mirror. There would soon be images upon it, I\nknew: De Boer had the lens-finder on his forehead, and the scenes at\nthe mine, as De Boer saw them would be flashed back to us here.\n\nThis Gutierrez was very watchful. A move on my part and I knew he\nwould fling a needle through me.\n\nMy thoughts flew. Hanley had notified Porto Rico. The patrol-ship had\nalmost enough time to get here by now.\n\nI felt Jetta plucking at me. She whispered:\n\n\"They have gone to attack the mine.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I heard it planned. Se\u00f1or Perona--\"\n\nHer hurried whispers told me further details of Perona's scheme. So\nthis was a pseudo attack! Perona would take advantage of it and hide\nthe quicksilver. De Boer would return presently and escape. And hold\nme for ransom. I chuckled grimly. Not so easy for a bandit, even one\nas clever as De Boer at hiding in the Lowland depths to arrange a\nransom for an agent of the United States. Our entire Lowland patrol\nwould be after him in a day.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJetta's swift whispers made it all clear to me. It was Perona's\nscheme.\n\nShe ended, \"And my father--\" Her voice broke; her eyes flooded\nsuddenly with tears \"Oh, Philip, he was good to me, my poor father.\"\n\nI saw that the mirror before Hans was glowing with its coming image. I\npressed Jetta's hand.\n\n\"Yes, Jetta.\"\n\nOne does not disparage the dead. I could not exactly subscribe to\nJetta's appraisal of her parent, but I did not say so.\n\n\"Jetta, the mirror is on.\"\n\nI turned away from her toward the instrument table. Gutierrez at the\ndoor raised his weapon. I said hastily, \"Nothing. I--we just want to\nsee the mirror.\"\n\nI stood beside Hans. He glanced at me and I tried to smile\ningratiatingly.\n\n\"This attack will be successful, eh, Hans?\"\n\n\"Damn. I hope so.\"\n\nThe mirror was glowing. Hans turned a switch to dim the tube-lights of\nthe room so that we might see the images better. It brought a protest\nfrom Gutierrez.\n\nI swung around. \"I'm not a fool! You can see me perfectly well: kill\nme if I make trouble. I want to see the attack.\"\n\n\"_Por Dios_, if you try anything--\"\n\n\"I won't!\"\n\n\"Shut!\" growled Hans. \"The audiphone is on. The big adventure--and the\ncommander--leaves me here just to watch!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA slit in the observatory pane was open. The dark figure of one of the\nbandits on guard outside came and called softly up to us.\n\n\"Started. Hans?\"\n\n\"Starting.\"\n\n\"Should it go wrong, call out.\"\n\n\"Yes. But it will not.\"\n\n\"There was an alarm, relayed probably to Great New York, the commander\nsaid, from Spawn's garden. These cursed prisoners--\"\n\n\"Shut! You keep watch out there. It is starting.\"\n\nThe guard slunk away. My attention went back to the mirror. An image\nwas formed there now, coming from the eye of the lens upon De Boer's\nforehead. It swayed with his walking. He was evidently leading his\nmen, for none of them were in the scene. The dark rocks were moving\npast. The lights of the mine were ahead and below, but coming nearer.\n\nThe audiphone hummed and crackled. And through it, De Boer's\nlow-voiced command sounded:\n\n\"To the left is the better path. Keep working to the left.\"\n\nThe image of the rocks and the mine swung with a dizzying sweep as De\nBoer turned about. Then again he was creeping forward.\n\nThe mine lights came closer. De Beer's whispered voice said: \"There\nthey are!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could see the lights of the mine's guards flash on. A group of\nSpawn's men gathered before the smelter building. The challenge\nsounded.\n\n\"Who are you? Stop!\"\n\nAnd De Boer's murmur: \"That is correct, as Perona said. They expect\nus. Well,\" he ended with a sardonic laugh, \"expect us.\"\n\nHis projector went up. He fired. In the silence of the control room we\ncould hear the audiphoned hiss of it, and see the flash in the\nmirror-scene. He had fired into the air.\n\nAgain his low voice to his men: \"Hold steady. They will run.\"\n\nThe group of figures at the smelter separated, waved and scattered\nback into the deeper shadows. Their hand-lights were extinguished, but\nthe moonlight caught and showed them. They were running away; hiding\nin the crags. They fired a shot or two, high in the air.\n\nDe Boer was advancing swiftly now. The image swayed and shifted,\nraised and lowered rhythmically as he ran. And the dark shape of the\nsmelter building loomed large as he neared it.\n\nI felt Jetta beside me: heard her whisper: \"Why, he should attack and\nthen come back! Greko told my father--\"\n\nBut De Boer was not coming back! He was dashing for the smelter\nentrance. Spawn's guards must have known then that there was something\nwrong. Their shots hissed, still fired high, and our grid sounded\ntheir startled shouts. Then as De Boer momentarily turned his head, I\nsaw what was taking place to the side of him. A detachment of the\nbandits had followed the retreating guards. The bandits' shots were\nlevelled now. Dim stabs of light in the gloom. One of the guards\nscreamed as he was struck.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe attack was real! But it was over in a moment. Spawn's men, those\nwho were not struck down, plunged away and vanished. Perona had\ndisconnected the mine's electrical safeguards. The smelter door was\nsealed, but it gave before the blows of a metal bar two of De Boer's\nmen were carrying.\n\nIn the unguarded, open strong-room, Perona, alone, was absorbed in his\ntask of carrying the ingots of quicksilver down into the hidden\ncompartment beneath its metal floor.\n\nOur mirror was vague and dim now with a moving interior of the main\nsmelter room as De Boer plunged through. At the strong-room entrance\nhe paused, with his men crowding behind him. The figure of Perona\nshowed in the vague light: he was stooping under the weight of one of\nthe little ingots. Beside him yawned the small trap-opening leading\ndownward.\n\nHe saw De Boer. He straightened, startled, and then shouted with a\nterrified Spanish oath. De Boer's projector was levelled: the huge,\nforeshortened muzzle of it blotted out half our image. It hissed its\npuff of light--a blinding flash on our mirror--in the midst of which\nthe dark shape of Perona's body showed as it crumpled and fell. Like\nSpawn, he met instant death.\n\nJetta was gripping me. \"Why--\" Gutierrez was with us. Hans was\nbending forward, watching the mirror. He muttered, \"Got him!\"\n\nI saw a chance to escape, and pulled at Jetta. But at once Gutierrez\nstepped backward.\n\n\"Like him I will strike you dead!\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo chance of escape. I had thought Gutierrez absorbed by the mirror,\nbut he was not. I protested vehemently:\n\n\"I haven't moved, you fool. I have no intention of moving.\"\n\nAnd now De Boer and his men were carrying up the ingots. A man for\neach bar. A confusion of blurred swaying shapes, and low-voiced,\ntriumphant murmurs from our disc.\n\nThen De Boer was outside the smelter house, and we saw a little queue\nof the bandits carrying the treasure up the defile. Coming back here\nto the flyer. There was no pursuit; the mine guards were gone.\n\nThe triumphant bandits would be here in a few moments.\n\n\"_Ave Maria, que magnifico!_\" Gutierrez had retreated to our doorway,\nmore alert than ever upon me and Jetta. Hans called through the\nwindow-slit:\n\n\"All is well, Franks!\"\n\n\"Got it?\"\n\n\"Yes! Make ready.\"\n\nThere was a stir outside as several of the bandits hastened down the\ndefile to meet De Boer. And the tread of others, inside the flyer at\ntheir posts, preparing for hasty departure.\n\nHans snapped off the audiphone and mirror. He bent over his control\npanel. \"All is well, Gutierrez. In a moment we start.\"\n\nThrough the observatory window I saw the line of De Boer's men coming:\nAbruptly Hans gave a cry. \"Look!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA glow was in the room. A faint aura of light. And our disconnected\ninstruments were crackling, murmuring with interference. Eavesdropping\nwaves were here! Hans realised it: so did I.\n\nBut there was no need for theory. From outside came shouts.\n\n\"Patrol-ship!\"\n\n\"Hurry!\"\n\nThe ship, suddenly exposing its lights, was perfectly visible above\nus. Five thousand feet up, possibly. A tiny silver bird in the\nmoonlight: but even with the naked eye I could see by its light\npattern that it was the official Porto Rican patrol-liner. It saw us\ndown here: recognized this bandit flyer, no doubt.\n\nAnd it was coming down!\n\nThere was a confusion as the bandits rushed aboard. The patrol was\ndropping in a swift spiral. I watched tensely, holding Jetta, with the\nturmoil of the embarking bandits around me. Gutierrez stood with\nlevelled weapon.\n\n\"They have not moved, Commander.\"\n\nDe Boer was here. The treasure was aboard.\n\n\"Ready, Hans. Lift us.\"\n\nThe landing portes clanged as they closed. Hans shoved at his\nswitches. I heard the helicopter engines thumping. A vertical lift:\nthere was no space in this rocky defile for any horizontal take-away.\n\nHe was very calm, this De Boer. He sat in a chair at a control-bank of\ninstruments unfamiliar to me.\n\n\"Full power, Hans: I tell you. Lift us!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ship was quivering. We lifted. The rocks of the gully dropped\naway. But the patrol-ship was directly over us. Was De Boer rushing\ninto a collision?\n\n\"Now, forward, Hans.\"\n\nWe poised for the level flight. Did De Boer think he could\nout-distance this patrol-ship, the swiftest type of flyer in the\nService? I knew that was impossible.\n\nThe silver ship overhead was circling, watchful. And as we levelled\nfor forward flight it shot a warning searchlight beam down across our\nbow, ordering us to land.\n\nDe Boer laughed. \"They think they have us!\"\n\nI saw his hand go to a switch. A warning siren resounded through our\ncorridor, warning the bandits of De Boer's next move. But I did not\nknow it then: the thing caught me unprepared.\n\nDe Boer flung another switch. My senses reeled. I heard Jetta cry out.\nMy arm about her tightened.\n\nA moment of strange whirling unreality. The control room seemed fading\nabout me. The tube-lights dimmed. A green glow took their place--a\nlurid sheen in which the cubby and the tense faces of De Boer and Hans\nshowed with ghastly pallor. Everything was unreal. The voices of De\nBoer and Hans sounded with a strange tonelessness. Stripped of the\ntimber that made one differ from the other. Hollow ghosts of human\nvoices. By the sound I could not tell which was De Boer and which was\nHans.\n\nThe corridor was dark; all the lights on the ship faded into this\nhorrible dead green. The window beside me had a film on it. A dead,\ndark opening where moonlight had been. Then I realized that I was\nbeginning to see through it once more. Starlight. Then the moonlight.\n\nWe had soared almost level with the descending patrol-ship. We went\npast it, a quarter of a mile away. Went past, and it did not follow.\nIt was still circling.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI knew then what had happened. And why this bandit ship had seemed of\nso strange an aspect. We were invisible! At four hundred yards, even\nin the moonlight, the patrol could not distinguish us. Only ten of\nthese X-flyers were in existence: they were the closest secret of the\nU. S. Anti-War Department. No other government had them except in\nimpractical imitations. I had never even seen one before.\n\nBut this bandit ship was one. And I recalled that a year ago, a\nsuppressed dispatch intimated that the Service had lost one--wrecked\nin the Lowlands and never found.\n\nSo this was that lost invisible flyer? De Boer, using it for\nsmuggling, with Perona and Spawn as partners. And now, De Boer making\naway in it with Spawn's treasure!\n\nThe bandit's hollow, toneless, unreal chuckle sounded in the gruesome\nlurid green of the control room.\n\n\"I think that surprised them!\"\n\nThe tiny silver shape of the baffled local patrol-ship faded behind us\nas we flew northward over heavy, fantastic crags; far above the tiny\ntwinkling lights of the village of Nareda--out over the sullen dark\nsurface of the Nares Sea.\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n_The Flight to the Bandit Stronghold_\n\nDuring this flight of some six hours--north, and then, I think,\nnortheast--to the remote Lowland fastness where De Boer's base was\nlocated, I had no opportunity to learn much of the operation of this\ninvisible flyer. But it was the one which had been lost. Wrecked, no\ndoubt, and the small crew aboard it all killed. The vessel, however,\nwas not greatly damaged: the crew were killed doubtless by escaping\npoisonous gases when the flyer struck.\n\nHow long it lay unfound, I cannot say. Perhaps, for days, it still\nmaintained its invisibility, while the frantic planes of the U. S.\nAnti-War Department tried in vain to locate it. And then, with its\nmagnetic batteries exhausting themselves, it must have become visible.\nPerona, making a solo flight upon Nareda business to Great London,\ncame upon it. Perona, Spawn and De Boer were then in the midst of\ntheir smuggling activities. They salvaged the vessel secretly. De\nBoer, with an incongruous flair for mechanical science, was enabled in\nhis bandit camp, to recondition the flyer--building a workshop for the\npurpose, with money which Perona freely supplied.\n\nSome of this I learned from De Boer, some is surmise: but I am sure it\nis close to the facts.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have since had an opportunity--through my connection with this\nadventure which I am recording--of going aboard one of the X-flyers of\nthe Anti-War Department, and seeing it in operation with its technical\ndetails explained to me. But since it is so important a Government\nsecret, I cannot set it down here. The principles involved are\ncomplex: the postulates employed, and the mathematical formulae\ndeveloping them in theory, are far too intricate for my understanding.\nYet the practical workings are simple indeed. Some of them were\nunderstood as far back as 1920 and '30, when that pioneer of modern\nastrophysics, Albert Einstein, first proved that a ray of light is\ndeflected from its normal straight path when passing through a\nmagnetic field.\n\nI am sorry that I cannot give here more than this vague hint of the\nworkings of the fantastic invisible flyers which to-day are so often\nthe subject of speculation by the general public which never has seen\nthem, and perhaps never will. But I think, too, that a lengthy\npedantic discourse here would be out of place. And tiring. After all,\nI am trying to tell only what happened to me in this adventure. And to\nlittle Jetta.\n\nA very strangely capable fellow, this young De Boer. A modern pirate:\nno other age could have produced him. He did not spare Perona's money,\nthat was obvious. From his hidden camp he must have made frequent\nvisits to the great Highland centers, purchasing scientific equipment:\nuntil now, when his path crossed mine. I found him surrounded by most\nof the every-day devices of our modern world. The village of Nareda\nwas primitive: backward. Save for its modern lights, a few local\naudiphones and image-finders, and its official etheric connections\nwith other world capitals, it might have been a primitive Latin\nAmerican village of a hundred years ago.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut not so De Boer's camp, which presently I was to see. Nor this, his\nflyer, with which his smuggling activities had puzzled Hanley's Office\nfor so many months. There was nothing primitive here.\n\nDe Boer himself was a swaggering villain. I saw him now with his cloak\ndiscarded, in the normal tube-lights of the control room when, after a\ntime, the mechanism of invisibility of the flyer was shut off. A\nfellow of six feet and a half at the very least, this De Boer. Heavy,\nyet with his great height and strength, lean and graceful. He wore a\nfabric shirt, with a wide-rolled collar. A wide belt of tanned hide,\nwith lighters, a little electron drink-cooler and other nick-nackeries\nhanging from tasseled cords--and a naked, ugly-looking knife blade\nclipped beside a holster which held an old-fashioned exploding\nprojector of leaden steel-tipped bullets.\n\nHis trousers were of leather, wide-flaring, ending at his brawny bare\nknees, with wide-cut, limp leather boots flapping about his calves in\nancient piratical fashion. They had flaring soles, these shoes, for\nwalking upon the Lowland caked ooze. The uppers were useless: I rather\nthink he wore them because they were picturesque. He was a handsome\nfellow, with rough-hewn features. A wide mouth, and very white, even\nteeth. A cruel mouth, when it went grim. But the smile was intriguing:\nI should think particularly so to women.\n\nHe had a way with him, this devil-may-care bandit. Strange mixture of\na pirate of old and an outlaw of our modern world. With a sash at his\nwaist, a red handkerchief about his forehead, and a bloody knife\nbetween his teeth. I could have fancied him a fabled pirate of the\nSpanish Main. A few hundred years ago when these dry Lowlands held the\ntossing seas. But I had seen him, so far, largely seated quietly in\nhis chair at his instrument table, a cigarette dangling from his lips,\nand, instead of a red bandanna about his forehead, merely the elastic\nband holding the lens of his image-finder. It caught in the locks of\nhis curly black hair. He pushed it askew; and then, since he did not\nneed it now, discarded it altogether.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhere we went I could not surmise, except that we flew low over the\nsullen black waters of the Nares Sea and then headed northeast. We\nkept well below the zero-height, with the dark crags of the Lowlands\npassing under us.\n\nThe night grew darker. Storm clouds obscured the moon; and it was then\nthat De Boer shut off the mechanism of invisibility. The control room,\nwith only the watchful Gutierrez now in it--besides De Boer, Jetta and\nmyself--was silent and orderly. But there were sounds of roistering\nfrom down the ship's corridor. The bandits, with this treasure of the\nradiumized quicksilver ingots aboard, were already triumphantly\ncelebrating.\n\nI sat whispering with Jetta. De Boer, busy with charts and\nnavigational instruments, ignored us, and Gutierrez, so long as we did\nnot move, seemed not to object to our whispers.\n\nThe night slowly passed. De Boer served us food, calling to one of his\nmen to shove a slide before us. For himself, he merely drank his\ncoffee and an alcoholic drink at his instrument table, while absorbed\nin his charts.\n\nThe roistering of the men grew louder. De Boer leaped to his feet,\ncursed them roundly, then went back to his calculations. He stood once\nbefore Jetta, regarding her with a strange, slow smile which made my\nheart pound. But he turned away in a moment.\n\nThe bandits, for all De Boer's admonitions, were now ill-conditioned\nfor handling this flyer. But I saw, through the small grid-opening in\nthe control room ceiling, the pilot in his cubby upon the wing-top.\nHe sat alert and efficient, with his lookout beside him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe night presently turned really tumultuous, with a great wind\noverhead, and storm clouds of ink, shot through occasionally by\nlightning flashes. We flew lower, at minus 2,000 feet, on the average.\nThe heavy air was sultry down here, with only a dim blurred vista of\nthe depths beneath us. I fancied that now we were bending eastward,\nout over the great basin pit of the mid-Atlantic area. No vessels\npassed us, or, if they did, I did not sight them.\n\nDe Boer had a detector on his table. Occasionally it would buzz with\ncalls: liners or patrols in our general neighborhood. He ignored them\nwith a sardonic smile. Once or twice, when our dim lights might have\nbeen sighted, he altered our course sharply. And, when at one period\nwe passed over the lights of some Lowland settlement, he flung us\nagain into invisibility until we were beyond range.\n\nI had, during these hours, ample opportunity to whisper with Jetta.\nBut there was so little for us to say. I knew all of Spawn's and\nPerona's plot. Both were dead: it was De Boer with whom we were\nmenaced now. And as I saw his huge figure lounging at his table, and\nhis frowning, intent face, the vision of the aged, futile Perona, who\nhad previously been my adversary, seemed inoffensive indeed.\n\nDe Boer obviously was pleased with himself. He had stolen half a\nmillion dollars of treasure, and was making off with it to his base in\nthe depths. He would smuggle these ingots into the world markets at\nhis convenience; months from now, probably. Meanwhile, what did he\nintend to do with me? And Jetta? Ransom me? I wondered how he could\nmanage it. And the thought pounded me. What about Jetta? I felt now\nthat she was all the world to me. Her safety, beyond any thought of\nsmugglers or treasure, was all that concerned me. But what was I\ngoing to do about it?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI pressed her hand. \"Jetta, you're not too frightened, are you?\"\n\n\"No, Philip.\"\n\nHer mind, I think, was constantly on her father, lying dead back there\non his garden path. I had not spoken of him, save once. She threatened\ninstant tears, and I stopped.\n\n\"Do not be too frightened. We'll get out of this.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He can't escape. Jetta; he can't hide. Why, in a day or so all the\npatrols of the United States Lowland Service will be after us!\"\n\nBut if the patrol-ships assailed De Boer, if he found things going\nbadly--he could so easily kill Jetta and me. He might be caught, but\nwe would never come through it alive.\n\nMy thoughts drifted along, arriving nowhere, just circling in the same\nfutile rounds. I was aware of Jetta falling asleep beside me, her face\nagainst my shoulder, her fingers clutching mine. She looked like a\nhalf grown, slender, ragged boy. But her woman's hair lay thick on my\narm, and one of the dark tresses fell to my hand. I turned my fingers\nin it. This strange little woman. Was my love for her foredoomed to\nend in tragedy? I swore then that I would not let it be so.\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n_Jetta Takes a Hand_\n\nI came from my reverie to find De Boer before me. He was standing with\nlegs planted wide, arms folded across his deep chest, and on his face\nan ironic smile.\n\n\"So tired! My little captives, _di mi_! You look like babes lost in a\nwood.\"\n\nI disengaged myself from Jetta, resting her against a cushion, and she\ndid not awaken. I stood up, fronting De Boer.\n\n\"What are you going to do with me?\" I demanded.\n\nHe held his ironic smile. \"Take you to my camp. You'll be well hidden,\nno one can follow me. My X-flyer's a very handy thing to have, isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"So you're the smuggler I was sent after?\"\n\nThat really amused him. \"Er--yes. Those tricksters, Perona and\nSpawn--we were what you would call partners. He had--the perfumed\nPerona--what he thought was a clever scheme for us. I was to take all\nthe risk, and he and Spawn get most of the money. Chah! They thought I\nwas imbecile--pretending to attack a treasure and being such a fool\nthat I would not seize it for myself! Not De Boer!\" He chuckled.\n\"Well, so very little did they know me. No treasure yet touched De\nBoer's fingers without lingering!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was in a talkative mood, and drew up his chair and slouched in it.\nI saw that he had been drinking some alcholite beverage, not enough to\nbefuddle him, but enough to take the keen edge off his wits, and make\nhim want to talk.\n\n\"Sit down, Grant.\"\n\n\"I'll stand.\"\n\n\"As you like.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do with me?\" I demanded again. \"Try to ransom\nme for a fat price from the United States?\"\n\nHe smiled sourly. \"You need not be sarcastic, young lad. The better\nfor you if I get a ransom.\"\n\n\"Then I hope you get it.\"\n\n\"Perona's idea,\" he added. \"I will admit it looked possible: I did not\nknow then you had Government protection.\" He went grim. \"That was\nPerona and Spawn's trickery. Well, they paid for it. No one plays De\nBoer false and lives to tell it. Perona and Spawn wanted to get rid of\nyou--because you annoyed them.\"\n\n\"Did I?\"\n\n\"With the little Jetta, I fancy.\" His gaze went to the sleeping Jetta\nand back to me. \"Perona was very sensitive where this little woman was\nconcerned. Why not? An oldish fool like him--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could agree with that, but I did not say so.\n\nI said, \"You'd better cast me loose, Jetta and me. I suppose you\nrealize, De Boer, that you'll have the patrols like a pack of hounds\nafter you. Jetta is a Nareda citizen: the United States will take that\nup. There's the theft of the treasure. And as you say, I'm a\nGovernment agent.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Your Government is over-zealous in protecting its agents.\nThat I know, Grant. I might have left you alone, there in the garden,\nwhen I realized it. But that, by damn, was too late! Live men talk.\nAny way, if I cannot ransom you, to kill you is very easy. And dead\nmen are shut-mouthed.\"\n\n\"I'm still alive, De Boer.\"\n\nHe eyed me. \"You talk brave.\"\n\nThis condescending, amused giant!\n\nI retorted. \"How are you going to ransom me?\"\n\n\"That,\" he said. \"I have not yet planned it. A delicate business.\"\n\nI ventured, \"And Jetta?\" My heart was beating fast.\n\n\"Jetta,\" he said with a sudden snap, \"is none of your business.\"\n\nAgain his gaze went toward her. \"I might marry her: why not? I am not\nwholly a villain. I could marry her legally in Cape Town, with all the\ntrappings of clergy--and be immune from capture under the laws there.\nIf she is seventeen. I have forgotten her age, it's been so long since\nI knew her. Is she seventeen? She does not look it.\"\n\nI said shortly. \"I don't know how old she is.\"\n\n\"But we can ask her when she awakens, can't we?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was amusing himself with me. And yet, looking back on it now, I\nbelieve he was more than half serious. From his pouch he drew a small\ncylinder. \"Have a drink, Grant. After all I bear you no ill-will. A\nman can but follow his trade: you were trying to be a good Government\nagent.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\"And then you may make it possible for me to pick a nice ransom.\nHere.\"\n\n\"I hope so.\" I declined the drink.\n\n\"Afraid for your wits?\"\n\nI said impulsively, \"I want all my wits to make sure you handle this\nransom properly, De Boer. I'm as interested as you are: in that at\nleast, we are together.\"\n\nHe grinned, tipped the cylinder at his lips for a long drink.\n\n\"Quite so--a mutual interest. Let us be friends over it.\"\n\nHis gaze wandered back to Jetta. He added slowly:\n\n\"She is very lovely, Grant. A little woodland flower, just ready for\nplucking.\" A sentimental tone, but there was in his expression a\nribald flippancy that sent a shudder through me. \"She has quite\novercome you, Grant. Well, why not me as well? I am certainly more of\na man than you. We must admit that Perona had a good eye.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy thoughts were wandering. Suppose I could not find an opportunity to\nescape with Jetta? De Boer might successfully ransom me and take her\nto Cape Town. Or if he feared that to try for the ransom would be too\ndangerous, doubtless he would kill me out of hand. An ill outcome\nindeed! Nor could I forget that there was half a million of treasure\ninvolved.\n\nIt was obvious to me that Hanley would not permit the patrol-ships to\nattack De Boer with the lives of Jetta and myself at stake. Hanley\nknew, or suspected, that De Boer was operating an invisible flyer, but\nI did not see how that could help Hanley much. Markes, acting for\nNareda, would doubtless be willing to ransom Jetta: the United States\nwould ransom me. I must urge the ransom plan, because for all the\nmoney in the world I would not endanger Jetta, nor let this bandit\ncarry her off.\n\nOr could I escape with her, and still find some means to save the\ntreasure? It was Jetta's treasure now, two-thirds of it, for it had\nlegally belonged to her father. Could I save it, and her as well?\n\nNot by any move of mine, here now on this flyer. That was impossible.\nIn De Boer's camp, perhaps. But that, too, I doubted. He was too\nclever a scoundrel to be lax in guarding me.\n\nBut in the effecting of a ransom--the exchange of me, and perhaps\nJetta, for a sum of money--that would be a delicate transaction, and\nsome little thing could easily go wrong for De Boer. There would be my\nchance. I would have to make something go wrong! Get in his confidence\nnow so that I would have some say in arranging the details of the\nransom. Make him think I was only concerned for my own safety. Appear\nclever in helping plan the exchange. And then so manipulate the thing\nthat I could escape with Jetta and save the treasure--and the ransom\nmoney as well. And capture De Boer, since that was what Hanley had\nsent me out to accomplish.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThoughts fly swiftly. All this flashed to me. I had no details as yet.\nBut that I must get into De Boer's confidence stood but clearly.\n\nI said abruptly, \"De Boer, since we are to be friends--\"\n\n\"So you prefer to sit down now?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" I had drawn a small settle to face him. \"De Boer, do you intend\nto ask a ransom for Jetta?\"\n\n\"You insist with that question?\"\n\n\"That is my way. Then we can understand each other. Do you?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said shortly.\n\nI frowned. \"I think I could get you a big price.\"\n\n\"I think I should prefer the little Jetta, Grant.\"\n\nI held myself outwardly unmoved. \"I don't blame you. But you will\nransom me? It can be worked out. I have some ideas.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he agreed. \"It can be worked perhaps. I have not thought of\ndetails yet. You are much concerned for your safety, Grant? Fear not.\"\n\nAn amused thought evidently struck him. He added. \"It occurs to me how\neasy, if I am going to ransom you, it will be for me to send you back\ndead. You might, if I send you back alive, tell them a lot of things\nabout me.\"\n\n\"I will not talk.\"\n\n\"Not,\" he said, \"if I close your mouth for good.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had no retort. There was no answering such logic; and with his\nmurders of Spawn and Perona, and the deaths of some of the police\nguards at the mine, the murder of me would not put him in much worse a\nposition.\n\nHe was laughing ironically. Suddenly he checked himself.\n\n\"Well, Jetta! So you have awakened?\"\n\nJetta was sitting erect. How long she had been awake, what she had\nheard. I could not say. Her gaze went from De Boer to me, and back\nagain.\n\n\"Yes, I am awake.\"\n\nIt seemed that the look she flashed me carried a warning. But whatever\nit was, I had no chance of pondering it, for it was driven from my\nmind by surprise at her next words.\n\n\"Awake, yes! And interested, hearing this Grant bargain with you for\nhis life.\"\n\nIt surprised De Boer as well. But the alcholite had dulled his wits,\nand Jetta realized this, and presumed upon it.\n\n\"Ho!\" exclaimed De Boer. \"Our little bird is angry!\"\n\n\"Not angry. It is contempt.\"\n\nHer look to me now held contempt. It froze me with startled chagrin;\nbut only for an instant, and then the truth swept me. Strange Jetta! I\nhad thought of her only as a child; almost, but not quite a woman. A\nfrightened little woodland fawn.\n\n\"Contempt, De Boer. Is he not a contemptuous fellow, this American?\"\n\nAgain I caught her look and understood it. This was a different\nJetta. No longer helplessly frightened, but a woman, fighting. She had\nheard De Boer calmly saying that he might send me back dead--and she\nwas fighting now for me.\n\nDe Boer took another drink, and stared at her. \"What is this?\"\n\nShe turned away. \"Nothing. But if you are going to ransom me--\"\n\n\"I am not, little bird.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe showed no aversion for him, and it went to his head, stronger than\nthe drink. \"Never would I ransom you!\"\n\nHe reached for her, but nimbly she avoided him. Acting, but clever\nenough not to overdo it. I held myself silent: I had caught again the\nflash of a warning gaze from her. She had fathomed my purpose. Get his\nconfidence. Beguile him. And woman is so much cleverer than the\ntrickiest man at beguiling!\n\n\"Do not touch me, De Boer! He tried that. He held my hand in the\nmoonlight--to woo me with his clever words.\"\n\n\"Hah! Grant, you hear her?\"\n\n\"And I find him now not a man, but a craven--\"\n\n\"But you will find me a man, Jetta.\" De Boer was hugely amused. \"See\nGrant, we are rivals! You and Perona, then you and me. It is well for\nyou that I fear you not, or I would run my knife through you now.\"\n\nI could not mistake Jetta's shudder. But De Boer did not see it, for\nshe covered it by impulsively putting her hand upon his arm.\n\n\"Did you--did you kill my father?\" She stumbled over the question. But\nshe asked it with a childlike innocence sufficiently real to convince\nhim.\n\n\"I? Why--\" He recovered from his surprise. \"Why no, little bird. Who\ntold you that I did?\"\n\n\"No one. I--no one has said anything about it.\" She added slowly, \"I\nhoped that it was not you, De Boer.\"\n\n\"Me? Oh no: it was an accident.\" He shot me a menacing glance. \"I will\nexplain it all. Jetta. Your father and I were friends for years--\"\n\n\"Yes. I know. Often he spoke to me of you. Many times I asked him to\nlet me meet you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were ignoring me. But Gutierrez, lurking in the door oval, was\nnot: I was well aware of that.\n\n\"I remember you from years ago, little Jetta.\"\n\n\"And I remember you.\"\n\nI understand the rationality of her purpose. She could easily get De\nBeer's confidence. She had known him when a child. Her father had been\nhis business partner, presumably his friend. And I saw her now\ncleverly altering her status here. She had been a captive, allied with\nme. She was changing that. She was now Spawn's daughter, here with her\ndead father's friend.\n\nShe turned a gaze of calm aversion upon me. \"Unless you want him here,\nDe Boer. I would rather talk to you--without him.\"\n\nHe leaped to his feet. \"Hah! that pleases me, little Jetta! Gutierrez,\ntake this fellow away.\"\n\nThe Spanish-American came slouching forward. \"The girl's an old\nfriend, Commander? You never told me that.\"\n\n\"Because it is no business of yours. Take him away. Seal him in\nD-cubby.\"\n\nI said sullenly. \"I misjudged both of you.\"\n\nJetta's gaze avoided me. As Gutierrez shoved me roughly down the\ncorridor, De Boer laughed, and his voice came back: \"Do not be afraid.\nWe will find some safe way of ransoming you--dead or alive!\"\n\nI was flung on a bunk in one of the corridor cubbies, and the door\nsealed upon me.\n\n(_To be continued._)\n\n\n\n\nAn Extra Man\n\n_By Jackson Gee_\n\n[Illustration: \"Harry turns into a thick smoke, and gets sucked into a\nbig hole in the machine.\"]\n\n[Sidenote: Sealed and vigilantly guarded was \"Drayle's Invention,\n1932\"----for it was a scientific achievement beyond which man dared\nnot go.]\n\n\nRays of the August mid-day sun pouring through the museum's glass roof\nbeat upon the eight soldiers surrounding the central exhibit, which\nfor thirty years has been under constant guard. Even the present\nsweltering heat failed to lessen the men's careful observation of the\nvisitors who, from time to time, strolled listlessly about the room.\n\nThe object of all this solicitude scarcely seemed to require it. A\ngreat up-ended rectangle of polished steel some six feet square by ten\nor a dozen feet in height, standing in the center of Machinery Hall,\nit suggested nothing sinister or priceless. Two peculiarities,\nhowever, marked it as unusual--the concealment of its mechanism and\nthe brevity of its title. For while the remainder of the exhibits\nlocated around it varied in the simplicity or complexity of their\ndesign, they were alike in the openness of their construction and\ndetailed explanation of plan and purpose. The great steel box,\nhowever, bore merely two words and a date: \"Drayle's Invention,\n1932.\"\n\nIt was, nevertheless, toward this exhibit that a pleasant appearing\nwhite-haired old gentleman and a small boy were slowly walking when a\nchange of guard occurred. The new men took their posts without words\nwhile the relieved detail turned down a long corridor that for a\nmoment echoed with the clatter of hobnailed boots on stone. Then all\nwas surprisingly still. Even the boy was impressed into reluctant\nsilence as he viewed the uniformed men, though not for long.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What's that, what's that, what's that?\" he demanded presently with\nshrill imperiousness. \"Grandfather, what's that?\" An excited arm\nindicated the exhibit with its soldier guard.\n\n\"If you can keep still long enough,\" replied the old gentleman\npatiently, \"I'll tell you.\"\n\nAnd with due regard for rheumatic limbs he slowly settled himself on a\nbench and folded his hands over the top of an ebony cane preparatory\nto answering the youngster's question. His inquisitor, however, was,\nat the moment, being hauled from beneath a brass railing by the\nsergeant of the watch.\n\n\"You'll have to keep an eye on him, sir,\" said the man reproachfully.\n\"He was going to try his knife on the wood-work when I caught him.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sergeant. I'll do my best--but the younger generation, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Sit still, if possible!\" he directed the squirming boy. \"If not,\nwe'll start home now.\"\n\nThe non-com took a new post within easy reaching distance of the\ndisturber and attempted to glare impressively.\n\n\"Go on, grandfather, tell me. What's D-r-a-y-l-e? What's in the box?\nCan't they open it? What are the soldiers for? Must they stay here?\nWhy?\"\n\n\"Drayle,\" said the old man, breaking through the barrage of questions,\n\"was a close friend of mine a good many years ago.\"\n\n\"How many, grandfather? Fifty? As much as fifty? Did father know him?\nIs father fifty?\"\n\n\"Forty; no; yes; no,\" said the harassed relative; and then with\namazing ignorance inquired: \"Do you really care to hear or do you just\nask questions to exercise your tongue?\"\n\n\"I want to hear the story, grandpa. Tell me the story. Is it a nice\nstory? Has it got bears in it? Polar bears? I saw a polar bear\nyesterday. He was white. Are polar bears always white? Tell me the\nstory, grandpa.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe old man turned appealing eyes toward the sergeant. Tacitly a\nsympathetic understanding was established. The warrior also was a\nfather, and off the field of battle he had known defeat.\n\n\"Leave me handle him, sir,\" he suggested. \"I've the like of him at\nhome.\"\n\n\"I'd be very much indebted to you if you would.\"\n\nThus encouraged, the soldier produced from an inner pocket and offered\none of those childhood sweets known as an \"all day sucker.\"\n\n\"See if you can choke yourself on that,\" he challenged.\n\nThe clamor ceased immediately.\n\n\"It always works, sir,\" explained the man of resource. \"The missus\nsays as how it'll ruin their indigestions, but I'm all for peace even\nif I am in the army.\"\n\nNow that his vocal organs were temporarily plugged, the child waved a\ndemanding arm in the direction of the main exhibit to indicate a\ndesire for the resumption of the narrative. But the ancient was not\nanxious to disturb so soon the benign and acceptable silence. In fact\nit was not until he observed the sergeant's look of inquiry that he\nbegan once more.\n\n\"That box,\" he said slowly, \"is both a monument and a milestone on the\nroad to mankind's progress in mechanical invention. It marks the point\nbeyond which Drayle's contemporaries believed it was unsafe to go: for\nthey felt that inventions such as his would add to the complexities\nof life, and that if a halt were not made our own machines would\nultimately destroy us.\n\n\"I did not, still do not, believe it. And I know Drayle's spirit broke\nwhen the authorities sealed his last work in that box and released him\nupon parole to abandon his experiments.\"\n\nAs the speaker sighed in regretful reminiscence, the sergeant glanced\nat his men. Apparently all was well: the only visible menace lolled\nwithin easy arm's reach, swinging his short legs and sucking noisily\non his candy. Nevertheless the non-com shifted to a slightly better\ntactical position as he awaited the continuance of the tale.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Christopher Drayle,\" said the elderly gentleman, \"was the greatest\nman I have ever known, as well as the finest. Forty years or more ago\nwe were close friends. Our homes on Long Island adjoined and I handled\nmost of his legal affairs. He was about forty-five or six then, but\nalready famous.\n\n\"His rediscovery of the ancient process of tempering copper had made\nhim one of the wealthiest men in the land and enabled him to devote\nhis time to scientific research. Electricity and chemistry were his\nspecialties, and at the period of which I speak he was deeply\nengrossed in problems of radio transmission.\n\n\"But he had many interests and not infrequently visited our local\ncountry club for an afternoon of golf. Sometimes I played around the\ncourse with him and afterward, over a drink, we would talk. His\nfavorite topic was the contribution of science to human welfare. And\neven though I could not always follow him when he grew enthusiastic\nabout some new theory I was always puzzled.\n\n\"It was at such a time, when we had been discussing the new and first\nsuccessful attempt to send moving pictures by radio, that I mentioned\nthe prophecy of Jackson Gee. Gee was the writer of fantastic,\npseudo-scientific tales who had said: 'We shall soon be able to\nresolve human beings into their constituent elements, transmit them by\nradio to any desired point and reassemble them at the other end. We\nshall do this by means of vibrations. We are just beginning to learn\nthat vibrations are the key to the fundamental process of all life.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I laughed as I quoted this to Drayle, for it seemed to me the ravings\nof a lunatic. But Drayle did not smile. 'Jackson Gee,' he said, 'is\nnearer to the truth than he imagines. We already know the elements\nthat make the human body, and we can put them together in their proper\nproportions and arrangements: but we have not been able to introduce\nthe vitalizing spark, the key vibrations to start it going. We can\nreproduce the human machine, but we can not make it move. We can\ndestroy life in the laboratory, and we can prolong it, but so far we\nhave not been able to create it. Yet I tell you in all seriousness\nthat that time will come; that time will come.'\n\n\"I was surprised at his earnestness and would have questioned him\nfurther. But a boy appeared just then with a message that Drayle was\nwanted at the telephone.\n\n\"Something important, sir,\" he said. Drayle went off to answer the\nsummons and later he sent word that he had been called away and would\nnot be able to return.\n\n\"It was the last I heard from Drayle for months. He shut himself in\nhis laboratory and saw no one but his assistants, Ward of Boston, and\nBuchannon of Washington. He even slept in the workshop and had his\nfood sent in.\n\n\"Ordinarily I would not have been excluded, for I had his confidence\nto an unusual degree and I had often watched him work. I admired the\ndeft movements of his hands. He had the certain touch and style of a\nmaster. But during that period he admitted only his aids.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Consequently I felt little hope of reaching him one morning when it\nwas necessary to have his signature to some legal documents. Yet the\nurgency of the case led me to go to his home on the chance that I\nmight be able to get him long enough for the business that concerned\nus. Luck was with me, for he sent out word that he would see me in a\nfew minutes. I remember seating myself in the office that opened off\nhis laboratory and wondering what was beyond the door that separated\nus. I had witnessed some incredible performances in the adjoining\nroom.\n\n\"At last Drayle came in. He looked worried and careworn. There were\nnew lines in his face and blue half-circles of fatigue beneath his\neyes. It was evident that it was long since he had slept. He\napologized for having kept me waiting and then, without examining the\npapers I offered, he signed his name nervously in the proper spaces.\nWhen I gathered the sheets together he turned abruptly toward the\nlaboratory, but at the door he paused and smiled.\n\n\"'Give my respects to Jackson Gee,' he said.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Who's Jackson Gee? Does father know him? Has he any polar bears?\nAren't you going to tell me about that?\"\n\nThe tidal wave of questions almost overwhelmed the historian and his\nauditor. But the military, fortunately, was equal to the emergency.\nWith a tactical turn of his hand he thrust the remnant of the lollypop\nbetween the chattering jaws and spoke with sharp rapidity.\n\n\"Listen,\" he commanded, \"that there, what you got, is a magic candy,\nand if you go on exposing it to the air after it is once in your mouth\nit's likely to disappear, just like that.\" And the speed of the\ntranslation was illustrated by a smart snapping of the fingers.\n\nDoubt shone in the juvenile terror's eyes and the earlier generations\nwaited fearfully while skepticism and greed waged their recurrent\nconflict. For a time it seemed as if the veteran had blundered; but\nfinally greed triumphed and a temporary peace ensued.\n\n\"Where was I?\" inquired the interrupted narrator when the issue of\nbattle was settled.\n\n\"You was talking about Jackson Gee,\" answered the guardsman in a\ncautiously low tone.\n\n\"So I was, so I was,\" the old gentleman agreed somewhat vaguely,\nnodding his head. He gazed at the sergeant with mingled awe and\nadmiration. \"I suppose it's quite useless to mention it,\" he said\nrather wistfully, \"but if you ever get out of the army and should want\na job.... You could name your own salary, you know?\" The question\nended on an appealing note.\n\nEvidently the soldier understood the digression, for he replied in a\ntone that would brook no dispute. \"No, sir, I couldn't consider it.\"\n\n\"I was afraid so,\" said the other regretfully, and added, with\napparent irrelevance, \"I have to live with him, you see.\"\n\n\"Tough luck,\" commiserated the listener.\n\nReluctantly summoning his thoughts from the pleasant contemplation of\nwhat had seemed to offer a new era of peace, the bard turned to his\nstory.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"A few hours later,\" he continued, \"I had a telephone call from\nDrayle's wife, and I realized from the fright in her voice that\nsomething dreadful had happened. She asked me to come to the house at\nonce. Chris had been hurt. But she disconnected before I could ask for\ndetails. I started immediately and I wondered as I drove what disaster\nhad overtaken him. Anything, it seemed to me, might have befallen in\nthat room of miracles. But I was not prepared to find that Drayle had\nbeen shot and wounded.\n\n\"The police were before me and already questioning the assailant, Mrs.\nFarrel, a fiery tempered young Irish-woman. When I entered the room\nshe was repeating half-hysterically her explanation that Drayle had\nkilled her husband in the laboratory that morning.\n\n\"'Right before my eyes, I seen it,' she shouted. 'Harry was standing\non a sort of platform looking at a big machine like, and so help me he\ndidn't have a stitch of clothes on, and I started to say something,\nbut all at once there came a terrible sort of screech and a flash like\nlightnin' kinda, in front of him. Then Harry turns into a sort of\nthick smoke and I can see right through him like he was a ghost; and\nthen the smoke gets sucked into a big hole in the machine and I know\nHarry's dead. And here's this man what done it, just a standin' there,\ngrinnin' horrid. So something comes over me all at once and I points\nHarry's gun at him and pulls the trigger!'\n\n\"Even before the woman had finished I recalled what I seen one\nafternoon in Drayle's laboratory many months before. I had been there\nfor some time watching him when he placed a small tumbler on a work\ntable and asked me if I had ever seen glass shattered by the\nvibrations of a violin. I told him that I had, but he went through the\ndemonstration as if to satisfy himself. Of course when he drew a bow\nacross the instrument's strings and produced the proper pitch the\ngoblet cracked into pieces exactly as might have been expected. And I\nwondered why Drayle concerned himself with so childish an experiment\nbefore I noticed that he appeared to have forgotten me completely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I endeavored then not to disturb him, and I remember trying to draw\nmyself out of his way and feeling that something momentous was about\nto take place. Yet actually I believe it would have required a\nconsiderable commotion to have distracted his attention, for his\nability to concentrate was one of the characteristics of his genius.\n\n\"I saw him place another glass on the table and I noticed then that\nit stood directly in front of a complicated mechanism. At first this\ngave out a low humming sound, but it soon rose to an unearthly whining\nshriek. I shrank from it involuntarily and a second later I was amazed\nat the sight of the glass, seemingly reduced to a thin vapor, being\ndrawn into a funnel-like opening near the top of the device. I was too\nstartled to speak and could only watch as Drayle started the\ncontrivance again. Once more its noise cut through me with physical\npain. I cried out. But my voice was overwhelmed by the terrific din of\nthe mysterious machine.\n\n\"Then Drayle strode down the long room to another intricate mass of\nwire coils and plates and lamps. And I saw a dim glow appear in two of\nthe bulbs and heard a noise like the crackling of paper. Drayle made\nsome adjustments, and presently I observed a peculiar shimmering of\nthe air above a horizontal metal grid. It reminded me of heat waves\nrising from a summer street, until I saw the vibrations were taking a\ndefinite pattern; and that the pattern was that of the glass I had\nseen dissolved into air. At first the image made me think of a picture\nformed by a series of horizontal lines close together but broken at\nvarious points in such fashion as to create the appearance of a line\nby the very continuity of the fractures. But as I watched, the plasma\nbecame substance. The air ceased to quiver and I was appalled to see\nDrayle pick up the tumbler and carry it to a scale on which he weighed\nit with infinite exactness. If he had approached me with it at that\nmoment I would have fled in terror.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Next, Drayle filled the goblet with some liquid which immediately\nafterward he measured in a beaker. The result seemed to please him,\nfor he smiled happily. At the same instant he became aware of my\npresence. He looked surprised and then a trifle disconcerted. I could\nsee that he was embarrassed by the knowledge that I had witnessed so\nmuch, and after a second or two he asked my silence. I agreed at\nonce, not only because he requested it but because I couldn't believe\nthe evidence myself. He let me out then and locked the door.\n\n\"It was this recollection that made me credit the woman's story. But I\nwas sick with dread, for in spite of my faith in Drayle's genius I\nfeared he had gone mad.\n\n\"Mrs. Drayle had listened to Mrs. Farrel's account calmly enough, but\nI could see the fear in her eyes when she signaled a wish to speak to\nme alone. I followed her into an adjoining room, leaving Mrs. Farrel\nwith the two policemen and the doctor, who was trying to quiet her.\n\n\"As soon as the door closed after us Mrs. Drayle seized my hands.\n\n\"'Tim,' she whispered, 'I'm horribly afraid that what the woman says\nis true. Chris has told me of some wonderful things he was planning to\ndo, but I never expected he would experiment on human beings. Can they\nsend him to prison?'\n\n\"Of course I said what I could to comfort her and tried to make my\nvoice sound convincing. At the time the legal aspect of the matter did\nnot worry me so much as the fear that the attack on Drayle might prove\nfatal. For even if it should develop that he was not dangerously hurt,\nI imagined that the interruption of the experiment at a critical\nmoment might easily have ruined whatever slim chance there had been of\nsuccess. For us the nerve-wracking part was that we could do nothing\nuntil the surgeon who was attending Drayle could tell us how badly he\nwas injured.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"At last word came that the bullet had only grazed Drayle's head and\nstunned him, but that he might remain unconscious for some time. Mrs.\nDrayle went in and sat at her husband's side, while I returned to the\nlaboratory and found the police greatly bewildered as to whether they\nought to arrest Drayle.\n\n\"They had discovered in a closet an outfit of men's clothing that Mrs.\nFarrel identified as her husband's, and, although they saw no other\ntrace of the missing man, they had a desire to lock up somebody as an\nevidence of their activity. It took considerable persuasion to prevail\nupon them to withhold their hands. There was no such difficulty about\nrestraining them in the laboratory. They were afraid to touch any\napparatus, and they gave the invention a ludicrously wide berth.\n\n\"I never knew exactly how long it was that I paced about the lower\nfloor of Drayle's home before the doctor summoned me and announced\nthat the patient wanted me, but that I must be careful not to excite\nhim. I have often wondered how many physicians would have to abandon\ntheir profession if they were deprived of that phrase. 'You must not\nexcite the patient.'\n\n\"Drayle was already excited when I entered. In fact, he was furious at\nthe doctor's efforts to restrain him. But I realized that my fear for\nhis reason was groundless. His remarks were lucid and forceful as he\nraged at the interference with his work. As soon as he saw me he\nappealed for assistance.\n\n\"'Make them let me alone. Tim,' he begged, as his wife and the doctor,\npartly by force and partly by persuasion, endeavored to hold him in\nbed. 'I must get back to the laboratory. That woman believes that I've\nkilled her husband, and my assistant will think that we've failed.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I was about to argue with him when suddenly he managed to thrust the\ndoctor aside and start toward the door. His seriousness impressed me\nso that I gave him a supporting arm and together we headed down the\nhall, with Mrs. Drayle and the doctor following anxiously in the rear.\nThe laboratory was deserted and locked when we arrived. The police\nevidently felt it was too uncanny an atmosphere for a prolonged wait.\nDrayle opened the door, went directly to his machine, and examined it\nminutely.\n\n\"'Thank the Lord that woman hit only me!' he said, and sank into a\nchair. Then he asked for some brandy. Mrs. Drayle rushed off and\nreappeared in a minute with a decanter and glass. Drayle helped\nhimself to a swallow that brought color to his cheeks and new strength\nto his limbs. Immediately after he turned again to the machine. I\ndragged up a chair, assisted him into it, and seated myself close by.\n\n\"I knew little enough about mechanics, but I was fascinated by the\nnumerous gauges that faced me on the gleaming instrument board. There\nwere dials with needlelike hands that registered various numbers;\nspots of color appeared in narrow slots close to a solar spectrum: a\nstream of graph-paper tape flowed slowly beneath a tracing-pen point\nand carried away a jiggly thin line of purple ink. In a moment Drayle\nwas oblivious of everything but his records. I watched him copy the\nindicated figures, surround them with formulas, and solve mysterious\nproblems with a slide-rule.\n\n\"His calculations covered a large sheet before he had finished. At\nlast he underscored three intricate combinations of letters and\nfigures and carried the answers to his private radio apparatus. This\noperated on a wave length far outside the range of all others and\ninsured him against interference. With it he was able to speak at any\ntime with his assistants in Washington or Boston or with both at once.\nHe threw the switch that sent his call into the air. An answer came\ninstantly, and Drayle begin to talk to his distant lieutenants.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"'We've been interrupted, gentlemen,' he said, 'but I think we may\ncontinue now. We'll reassemble in the Boston laboratory. Have you\narranged the elements? The coefficients are....' And he gave a\nsuccession of decimals.\n\n\"A voice replied that all was ready. Drayle said 'Excellent,' went\nback to his invention and twisted a black knob on the board before\nhim.\n\n\"With this trifling movement all hell seemed to crash about us. The\nghastly cacophony that I had experienced in the same room some months\npreviously was as nothing. These stupendous waves of sound pounded us\nuntil it seemed as if we must disintegrate beneath them. Wails and\nscreams engulfed us. Mrs. Drayle dropped to her knees beside her\nhusband. The doctor seized my arm and I saw the knuckles of his hand\nturn white with the pressure of his grip, yet I felt nothing but the\nawful vibrations that drummed like riveting machines upon and through\nmy nerves and body. It was not an attack upon the ears alone; it\ncrashed upon the heart, beat upon the chest so that breathing seemed\nimpossible. My brain throbbed under the terrific pulsations. For a\nwhile I imagined the human system could not endure the ordeal and that\nall of us must be annihilated.\n\n\"Except for his slow turning of the dials Drayle was motionless before\nthe machine. Below the bandage about his forehead I could see his\nfeatures drawn with anxiety. He had wagered a human life to test his\ntheory and I think the enormity of it had not struck him until that\nmoment.\n\n\"What I knew and hoped enabled me to imagine what was taking place in\nthe Boston laboratory. I seemed to see man's elementary dust and\nvapors whirled from great containers upward into a stratum of\nshimmering air and gradually assume the outlines of a human form that\nbecame first opaque, then solid, and then a sentient being. At the\nsame instant I was conscious that the appalling pandemonium had ceased\nand that the voice of Drayle's Boston assistant was on the radio.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"'Congratulations, Chief! His reassemblage is perfect. There's not a\nflaw anywhere.' \"'Splendid,' Drayle answered. 'Bring him here by\nplane right away; his wife is worried about him.'\n\n\"Then Drayle turned to me.\n\n\"'You see,' he said, 'Jackson Gee was right. We have resolved man into\nhis constituent elements, transmitted his key vibrations by radio, and\nreassembled him from a supply of identical elements at the other end.\nAnd now, if you will assure that woman that her husband is safe, I\nwill get some sleep. You will have the proof before you in less than\nthree hours.'\n\n\"I can't vouch for the doctor's feelings, but as Drayle left us I was\nsatisfied that everything was as it should be, and that I had just\nwitnessed the greatest scientific achievement of all time. I did not\nforesee, nor did Drayle, the results of an error or deliberate\ndisobedience on the part of one of his assistants.\n\n\"We waited, the doctor and I, for the arrival of the man who, we were\nconvinced, had been transported some three hundred miles in a manner\nthat defied belief. The evidence would come, Drayle had said, in a few\nhours. Long before they had elapsed we were starting at the sound of\nevery passing motor, for we knew that a plane must land some distance\nfrom the house and that the travelers would make the last mile or so\nby car.\n\n\"Mrs. Drayle endeavored to convince the imagined widow that her\nhusband was safe and was returning speedily. Later she rejoined us,\nfull of questions that we answered in a comforting blind faith. The\ntime limit was drawing to a close when the sound of an automobile horn\nwas quickly followed by a sharp knock on the laboratory door. At a\nsign from Mrs. Drayle one of the policemen opened it and we saw two\nmen before us. One, a scholarly appearing, bespectacled youth, I\nrecognized as Drayle's Boston assistant, Ward; the other, a rather\nburly individual, was a stranger to me. But there was no doubt he was\nthe man we awaited so eagerly, for Mrs. Farrel screamed 'Harry!\nHarry!' and sped across the room towards him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"At first she ran her fingers rather timidly over his face, and then\npinched his huge shoulders, as if to assure herself of his reality.\nThe sense of touch must have satisfied her, for abruptly she kissed\nhim, flung her arms about him, clung to him, and crooned little\nendearments. The big man, in turn, patted her cheeks awkwardly and\nmumbled in a convincingly natural voice, ''Sall right, Mary, old kid!\nThere ain't nothin' to it. Yeah! Sure it's me!'\n\n\"Then I was conscious of Drayle's presence. A brown silk dressing gown\nfell shapelessly about his spare frame and smoke from his cigarette\nrose in a quivering blue-white stream. Ward spied him at the same\nmoment and stepped forward with quick outstretched hands. I remember\nthe flame of adoring zeal in the youngster's eyes as he tried to\nspeak. At length he managed to stammer some congratulatory phrases\nwhile Drayle clapped him affectionately on the back.\n\n\"Then Drayle turned to Farrel to ask him how he enjoyed the trip.\nFarrel grinned and said, 'Fine! It was like a dream, sir! First I'm in\none place and then I'm in another and I don't know nothing about how I\ngot there. But I could do with a drink, sir. I ain't used to them\nairyplanes much.'\n\n\"Drayle accepted the hint and suggested that we all celebrate. He gave\ninstructions over a desk telephone and almost immediately a man\nentered with a small service wagon containing a wide assortment of\nliquors and glasses. When we had all been served, Ward asked somewhat\nhesitantly if he might propose a toast. 'To Dr. Drayle, the greatest\nscientist of all time!'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We were of course, already somewhat drunk with excitement as we\nlifted our glasses. But Drayle would not have it.\n\n\"'Let me amend that,' he said. 'Let us drink to the future of\nscience.'\n\n\"'Sure!' said Farrel, very promptly. I think he was somewhat uncertain\nabout 'toast,' but he clung hopefully to the word 'drink.'\n\n\"We had raised our glasses again when Drayle, who was facing the door,\ndropped his. It struck the floor with a little crash and the liquor\nspattered my ankles. Drayle whispered 'Great God!' I saw in the\ndoorway another Farrel. He was grimy, disheveled, his clothing was\ntorn, and his expression ugly; but his identity with 'Harry' was\nunescapable. For an instant I suspected Drayle of trickery, of\nperpetrating some fiendishly elaborate hoax. And then I heard Mrs.\nFarrel scream, heard the newcomer cry, 'Mary,' and saw two men staring\nat each other in bewilderment.\n\n\"The explanation burst upon me with a horrible suddenness. Farrel had\nbeen reconstructed in each of Drayle's distant laboratories, and there\nstood before us two identities each equally authentic, each the legal\nhusband of the woman who, a few hours previously, had imagined herself\na widow. The situation was fantastic, nightmarish, unbelievable and\nundeniable. My head reeled with the fearful possibilities.\n\n\"Drayle was the first to recover his poise. He opened a door leading\ninto an adjoining room and motioned for us all to enter. That is, all\nbut the police. He left them wisely with their liquor. 'Finish it,' he\nadvised them. 'You see no one has been killed.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"They were not quite satisfied, but neither were they certain what\nthey ought to do, and for once displayed common sense by doing\nnothing. When the door closed after us I saw that Buchannon, the\nWashington laboratory assistant, was with us. He must have arrived\nwith the second Farrel, although I had not observed him during the\nconfusion attending the former's unexpected appearance. But Drayle had\nnoted him and now seized his shoulders. 'Explain!' he demanded.\n\n\"Buchannon's face went white and he shrank under the clutch of\nDrayle's fingers. Beyond them I saw the two twinlike men standing\nbeside Mrs. Farrel, surveying each other with incredulous recognition\nand distaste.\n\n\"'Explain!' roared Drayle, and tightened his grasp.\n\n\"'I thought you said Washington, Chief.' His voice was not convincing.\nI didn't believe him, nor did Drayle.\n\n\"'You lie!' he raged, and floored the man with his fist.\n\n\"In a way I couldn't help feeling sorry for the chap. It must have\nbeen a frightful temptation to participate in the experiment and I\nsuppose he had not forseen the consequences. But I began to have a\nglimmering of the magnificent possibilities of the invention for\npurposes far beyond Drayle's intent. For, I asked myself, why, if such\na machine could produce two human identities, why not a score, a\nhundred, a thousand? The best of the race could be multiplied\nindefinitely and man could make man at last, literally out of the dust\nof the earth. The virtue of instantaneous transmission which had been\nDrayle's aim sank into insignificance beside it. I fancied a race of\nsupermen thus created. And I still believe, Sergeant, that the chance\nfor the world's greatest happiness is sealed within that box you\nguard. But its first fruits were tragic.\"\n\nThe historian shifted his position on the bench so as to escape the\nsun that was now reflected dazzlingly by the polished steel casket.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Drayle did not glance again at his disobedient lieutenant. He was\nconcerned with the problem of the extra man, or, I should say, an\nextra man, for both were equal. Never before in the history of the\nworld had two men been absolutely identical. They were, of course, one\nin thought, possessions and rights, physical attributes and\nappearance. Mrs. Farrel, as they were beginning to realize, was the\nwife of both. And I have an unworthy suspicion that the red-headed\nyoung woman, after she recovered from the shock, was not entirely\ndispleased. The two men, however, finding that each had an arm about\nher waist, were regarding each other in a way that foretold trouble.\nBoth spoke at the same time and in the same words.\n\n\"'Take your hands off my wife!'\n\n\"And I think they would have attacked each other then if Drayle hadn't\nintervened. He said, 'Sit down! All of you!' in so peremptory a voice\nthat we obeyed him.\n\n\"'Now,' he went on, 'pay attention to me. I think you realize the\nsituation. The question is, what we shall do about it?' He pointed an\naccusing finger at the Farrel from Washington. 'You were not\nauthorized to exist; properly we should retransmit you, and without\nreassembling you would simply cease to be.'\n\n\"The man addressed looked terrified. 'It would be murder!' he\nprotested.\n\n\"'Would it?' Drayle inquired of me.\n\n\"I told him that it could not be proved inasmuch as there would be no\n_corpus delicti_ and hence nothing on which to base a charge.\n\n\"But the Washington Farrel seemed to have more than an academic\ninterest in the question and grew obstinate.\n\n\"'Nothing doing!' he announced emphatically. 'Here I am and here I\nstay. I started from this place this morning and now I'm back, and as\nfor that big ape over there I don't know nothing about him--except\nhe'll be dead damn soon if he don't keep away from my wife.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The other Drayle-made man leaped up at this, and again I expected\nviolence. But Buchannon flung himself between, and they subsided,\nmuttering.\n\n\"'Very well, then,' Drayle continued, when the room was quiet, 'here\nis another solution. We can, as you realize, duplicate Mrs. Farrel,\nand I will double your present possessions.'\n\n\"This time it was Mrs. Farrel who was dissatisfied. 'You ain't\ntalking to me,' she informed Drayle. 'Me stand naked in front of all\nthem lamps and get turned into smoke? Not me!' A smile spread over her\nface and her eyes twinkled with deviltry. 'I didn't never think I'd be\nin one of them triangles like in the movies, and with my own husbands,\nbut seein' I am, I'm all for keeping them both. Then I might know\nwhere one of them was some of the time.'\n\n\"But neither of the men took to this idea and the problem appeared\nincreasingly complex. I proposed that the survivor be determined by\nlot, but this suggestion won no support from anyone. Again the two men\nspoke at the same instant and in the same words. It was like a\ncarefully rehearsed chorus. 'I know my rights, and I ain't going to be\ngypped out of them!'\n\n\"It was at this point that Drayle attempted bribery. He offered fifty\nthousand dollars to the man who would abandon Mrs. Farrel. But this\nscheme fell through because both men sought the opportunity and Mrs.\nFarrel objected volubly.\n\n\"So in the end Drayle promised each of them the same amount as a price\nfor silence and left the matter of their relationships to their own\nsettlement.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I was skeptical of the success of the plan but could offer nothing\nbetter. So I drew up a release as legally binding as I knew how to\nmake it in a case without precedent. I remember thinking that if the\nmatter ever came into court the judge would be as much at a loss as I\nwas.\n\n\"Our troubles, though, didn't spring from that source. Each of the\nthree parties accepted the arrangement eagerly and Drayle dismissed\nthem with a hand-shake, a wish for luck and a check for fifty thousand\ndollars each. It's very nice to be wealthy, you know.\n\n\"Afterward, we went out and paid off the police. Perhaps that's\nstating it too bluntly. I mean that Drayle thanked them for their\nzealous attention to his interests, regretted that they had been\nunnecessarily inconvenienced and treated that they would not take\namiss a small token of his appreciation of their devotion to duty.\nThen he shook hands with them both and I believe I saw a yellow bill\ntransferred on each occasion. At any rate the officers saluted smartly\nand left.\n\n\"Of course I was impatient to question Drayle, but I could see that he\nwas desperately fatigued. So I departed.\n\n\"Next morning I found my worst fears exceeded by the events of the\nnight. The three Farrels who had left us in apparently amiable spirits\nhad proceeded to the home of Mrs. and the original Mr. Farrel. There\nthe argument of who was to leave had been resumed. Both men were, of\ncourse, of the same mind. Whether both desired to stay or flee I would\nnot presume to say. But an acrimonious dispute led to physical\nhostilities, and while Mrs. Farrel, according to accounts, cheered\nthem on, they literally fought to the death. Being equally capable,\nthere was naturally, barring interruption, no other possible outcome.\nI can well believe they employed the same tactics, swung the same\nblows, and died at the same instant.\n\n\"Mrs. Farrel, after carefully retrieving both of her husbands' checks,\ntold a great deal of the story. As might be expected, nobody believed\nthe yarn except our profound federal law makers. They welcomed an\nopportunity to investigate an outsider for a change and had all of us\nbefore a committee.\n\n\"Finally the Congress of these United States of America, plus the\nsagacious Supreme Court, decided that my client wasn't guilty of\nanything, but that he mustn't do it again. At least that was the gist\nof it. I recollect that I offered a defense of psycopathic\nneuroticism.\n\n\"As a result of the _obiter dictum_ and a resolution by both Houses\nAssembled Drayle's invention was sealed, dated and placed under guard.\nThat's its history, Sergeant.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe white-haired old gentleman picked up the high silk hat that added\na final touch of distinction to his tall figure, and looked about him\nas if trying to recall something. At last the idea came.\n\n\"By the way,\" he inquired suddenly, \"didn't I have an extraordinarily\nobnoxious grandson with me when I came?\"\n\nThe attentive auditor was vastly startled. He surveyed the great hall\nrapidly, but reflected before he answered.\n\n\"No, sir--I mean he ain't no more'n average! But I reckon we'd better\nfind him, anyhow.\"\n\nHis glance had satisfied the sergeant that at least the object of his\ncharge was safe and his men still vigilant. \"I'll be back in a\nminute,\" he informed them. \"Don't let nothin' happen.\"\n\n\"Bring us something more'n a breath,\" pleaded the corporal,\ndisrespectfully.\n\nThe sergeant had already set off at a brisk pace with the story\nteller. For several minutes as they rushed from room to room the hunt\nwas unrewarded.\n\n\"I think, sir,\" said the sergeant, \"we'd better look in the natural\nhistory division. There is stuffed animals in there that the kids is\nfond of.\"\n\n\"You're probably right,\" the patriarch gasped as he struggled to\nmaintain the gait set by the younger man. \"I might have known he\ndidn't really want to hear the story.\"\n\n\"They never do,\" answered the other over his shoulder. \"I'll bet\nthat's him down there on the next floor.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe two searchers had emerged upon a wide gallery that commanded a\nclear view of the main entrance where various specimens of American\nfauna were mounted in intriguing replicas of their native habitat.\n\nThe guard pointed an accusing finger at one of these groups and sprang\ntoward the stairs.\n\nThe old gentleman's breath and strength were gone. He could only gaze\nin the direction that had been indicated by the madly running guard;\nbut he had no doubts. A small boy was certainly digging vigorously at\nthe head of a specimen of _Ursus Polaris_ that the curator had\nrepresented in the dramatic pose of killing a seal. A protesting wail\narose from below as the young naturalist was withdrawn from his field\nby a capable hand on the slack of his trousers. And presently,\nchagrined with failure, the culprit was before his grandsire.\n\n\"Gee!\" he complained, \"I was only looking at the polar bear. Are polar\nbears always white? Are--\"\n\n\"You'd better take him away, sir,\" interrupted the sergeant. \"He was\ntrying to pry out one of the bear's eyes with the stick of the\nlollypop I give him. Take him.\"\n\nThe old gentleman extended both hands. His left found a grip in his\ngrandson's coat collar; his right, partly concealing a government\nengraving, met the guard's with a clasp of gratitude.\n\n\"Sergeant,\" he remarked in a voice tense with feeling, \"a half-hour\nago I expressed some ridiculous regrets that Drayle's invention had\nbeen kept from the world. Now I realize its horrid menace. I shudder\nto think it might have been responsible for two like him!\"\n\nThe object of disapproval was shaken indicatively.\n\n\"Guard the secret well, Sergeant! Guard it well! The world's peace\ndepends upon you!\" The old gentleman's words trembled with conviction.\n\nThen alternately shaking his head and his grandson he marched down the\nhallway, ebony cane tapping angrily upon the stone.\n\nAs the exhausted but happy warrior retraced his steps a high-pitched\nvoice floated after him.\n\n\"Grandpa, are polar bears _always_ white?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Advertisement: ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Reader's Corner\n\n_A Meeting Place for Readers of_\n\nAstounding Stories\n\n[Illustration: _The Reader's Corner_]\n\n\n_The Invisible X-Flyers_\n\n     The following is a semi-technical description of the\n     operation of the invisible X-flyers used in \"Jetta of the\n     Lowlands\" as compiled by Philip Grant in the year 2021 from\n     official records of the Anti-War Department of the United\n     States of North America, and discovered recently by Ray\n     Cummings.\n\n     The attainment of mechanical invisibility reached a state of\n     perfection in the year 2000 sufficient to make it practical\n     for many uses. For a century this result had been sought. It\n     came, about the year 2000, not as a single startling\n     discovery, but as the culmination of the patient labor of\n     many men during many years. The popular mind has always\n     considered that science advances by a series of \"great\n     scientific discoveries\"; \"unprecedented\"; \"revolutionary.\"\n     That is not so. Each step in the progress of scientific\n     achievement is built most carefully upon the one beneath it.\n     And generally the \"revolutionary, unprecedented discovery\"\n     has very little of itself that is new; rather it is a new\n     combination of older, perhaps seemingly impractical\n     knowledge. Every scientific theory, every device, is the\n     offspring from a large and varied family tree of many\n     scientific ancestors, each of whom in his day was a\n     remarkable personage.\n\n     Thus it is, with the principles of mechanical invisibility.\n     I deal here with the famous X-flyers. The operation of the\n     plane itself is immaterial; its motors; its wing-spread\n     surfaces; its aerial controls. I am concerned only with the\n     scientific principles underlying its power of invisibility.\n\n     Three scientific factors are involved: First, the process\n     known as de-electroniration; second, the theories of color\n     absorption; third, the material, inevitable deflection\n     (bending) of light rays when passing through a magnetic\n     field.\n\n     I take each of the three in order. The forerunners of\n     de-electroniration were the Martel effects--the experiments\n     of Charles Martel, in Paris, in 1937. A new electric\n     current, of a different character--now called the\n     oscillating current as distinct from the alternating and\n     direct--was developed. Metallic plates were\n     electro-magnetized to produce an enveloping magnetic field\n     of somewhat a different character from any field formerly\n     known.\n\n     Dr. Norton Grenfell followed this in 1946 by using the\n     Martel oscillating current to obtain a reverse effect. A\n     similar disturbance of electrode balance. But not a\n     surcharge. An exhaustion. An anti-electrical state, instead\n     of a state of magnetism. A metallic mass so treated--and\n     with a constant flow of oscillating current holding its\n     subnormal electronic balance--was then said to be\n     de-electronired.\n\n     Scientific \"discoveries\" are largely made by the trial and\n     error system. The scientist takes what he finds. Generally\n     he does not know, at first, what it means. Martell took his\n     oscillating current and \"discovered\" the Martel Magnetic\n     Levitation, whereby gravity was lessened, and then\n     completely nullified. Grenfell, with his de-electroniration,\n     increased the power of gravity. The two were combined by\n     Grenfell and his associates--and the secret of\n     interplanetary flight was at hand.\n\n     But there was a host of other workers not interested in\n     space flyers; they probed in other directions. It was found\n     that the subnormal magnetic field surrounding a metallic\n     substance in a state of de-electroniration had two unusual\n     properties: its color absorption was high; and it bent light\n     rays from their normal straight path into a curve abnormally\n     great. Yet, though it absorbed the color of the rays\n     emanating from the de-electronired metal (the metal itself\n     increasing this result), the magnetic field, while bending\n     the rays passing through it from distant objects behind it,\n     nevertheless left their color and all their inherent\n     properties unchanged.\n\n     The principles of color absorption are these:--a pigment--a\n     paint, a dye, if you will--is \"red\" because it absorbs from\n     the light rays of the sun all the other colors and leaves\n     only red to be reflected from it to the eye. Or \"violet\"\n     because all the rest are absorbed, and the violet is\n     reflected. Or \"black\" because all are absorbed; and \"white\"\n     the reverse, all blended and reflected. Color is dependent\n     upon vibratory motion. The solar spectrum--its range of\n     visibility through the primary colors from red to\n     violet--can be likened to a range of radio wave-lengths;\n     vibration frequencies; and when we eliminate them all save\n     the \"violet\"--that is what we have left, in the radio to\n     hear, in color absorption to see.\n\n     Thus, a de-electronired metal was found to produce black.\n     Not black as habitually we meet it--a \"shiny\" black, a\n     \"dull\" black; but a true black--a real absence of light-ray\n     reflection--a \"nothingness to see\"; in effect, an\n     invisibility.\n\n     A word of explanation is necessary regarding the other\n     property of the de-electronired field--the bending of\n     distant light rays into a curve, yet leaving their spectrum\n     unchanged. It was Albert Einstein who first made the\n     statement--in the years following the turn of the century at\n     1900--that it was a normal, natural thing for a ray of light\n     to be slightly deflected from its straight path when passing\n     through a magnetic field. The claim caused world-wide\n     interest, for upon its truth or falsity the whole fabric of\n     the Einstein Theory of Relativity was woven.\n\n     An eclipse of the sun in the 1920's established that light\n     is actually bent in the manner Einstein had calculated. A\n     magnetic field surrounds the sun. In those days they did\n     not know that it is a field of subnormal electronic\n     balance--in effect, the result of de-electroniration. It was\n     found, nevertheless, that stars close to the limb of the sun\n     appeared, not in their true positions, but shifted in just\n     the directions and with the amount of shift Einstein\n     predicted. The light rays coming from them to the eye of the\n     observer on Earth were curved in passing so close to the\n     sun. But the color-bands of their spectrums were unaltered.\n\n     And some of the stars actually were behind the sun, yet\n     because of the curved path of the light, were visible. I\n     mention this because it is an important aspect of the\n     subject of mechanical invisibility.\n\n     With the foregoing factors, the secret of mechanical\n     invisibility is constructed. Gracely, an American--following\n     a long series of world-wide experiments, tests of current\n     strength, frequencies of oscillation, suitable metals, etc.,\n     which I cannot detail here--in 1955 was the final developer\n     of the mechanisms subsequently used in the X-flyers.\n\n     Gracely produced what he christened \"aluminoid-spectrite\"--a\n     light-weight alloy which, when carrying an oscillating\n     electronic current of the proper frequency, produced the\n     effects I have described. It absorbed from the light rays\n     coming from the metal, all the colors of the solar spectrum,\n     well beyond the range of the human eye at both ends of the\n     scale. The result was a \"visible nothingness.\"\n\n     A moment's thought will make clear that term. A visible\n     nothingness is not invisibility. The fact that something was\n     there but could not be seen was obvious. A black hat with a\n     light on it and placed against an average background is\n     almost as easy to see as a white hat. Gracely's first crude\n     experiments were made with an aluminoid-spectrite cube--a\n     small brick a foot in each dimension. The cube glowed,\n     turned, dark, then black, then was gone. He had it resting\n     on a white table, with a white background. And the fact that\n     the cube was still there, was perfectly obvious. It was as\n     though a hole of nothingness were set against the white\n     table. It outlined the cube; reconstructed it so that for\n     practical purposes the eye saw not a white, aluminoid brick,\n     but a dead black one.\n\n     And this is very much what a man sees when he stares at his\n     black hat on a table. The hat occults its background, and\n     thus reconstructs itself.\n\n     But when Gracely determined the proper vibrations of his\n     oscillating current to coincide with all the other material\n     factors he was using, the final result was before him-real\n     invisibility. He used a patterned background--a\n     symmetrically checkered surface, most difficult of all. The\n     light rays coming from this background passed through the\n     magnetic field surrounding the invisible colorless cube, and\n     were bent into a curved path. But their own\n     color-spectrum--in actuality the color, shape, all the\n     visible characteristics of the background--was not greatly\n     altered. The observer saw what actually was behind the\n     invisible cube: the checkered background, sometimes\n     slightly distorted, but nevertheless sufficiently clear for\n     its abnormality to escape notice. Thus the cube's outlines\n     were not reconstructed; and, in effect, it had vanished.\n\n     In practical workings with the X-flyers, no such difficult\n     test as Gracely's cube and rectangular, symmetrically\n     patterned background is ever met. The varying background\n     behind a plane--at rest or flying, and particularly at\n     night--demands less perfection of background than Gracely's\n     laboratory conditions. I am informed that an X-flyer can\n     vaguely be seen--or sensed, rather--from some angles and\n     under certain and unfavorable conditions of light, and\n     depending on its line of movement relative to the angle of\n     observation, and the type and color-lighting of its\n     background. But under most conditions it represents a very\n     nearly perfect mechanical invisibility.\n\n     There is one aspect of the subject with which I may close\n     this brief paper. I give it without technical explanation;\n     it seems to me an amusing angle.\n\n     The theory of stereoscopics--the vision of the twin lenses\n     of the human eyes, set a distance apart to give the\n     perception of depth, of the third dimension--is in itself a\n     subject tremendously interesting, and worthy of anyone's\n     study. I have no space for it here, nor would it be strictly\n     relevant. I need only state that a two-eyed man sees\n     partially around an object (by virtue of the different\n     angles from which each of his eyes gaze at it) and thus sees\n     a trifle more of the background than would otherwise be the\n     case. And this--these two viewpoints blended in his\n     brain--gives him his perception of \"depth,\" of\n     \"solidity\"--the difference between a real scene of three\n     dimensions and a painted scene on a canvas of two dimensions\n     with only the artist's skill in perspective to simulate the\n     third.\n\n     And I cannot refrain from mentioning that in Government\n     tests of the Anti-War Department to determine the perfection\n     of the invisibility of the X-flyers, it was a one-eyed man\n     who proved that they were not always totally invisible!--Ray\n     Cummings.\n\n\n_Thank You_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I just want you to know this: I am a reader of your truly\n     named Astounding Stories. I really enjoyed reading the\n     \"Spawn of the Stars,\" also \"Brigands of the Moon,\" and I am\n     very glad to hear that we are going to have another of\n     Charles W.

I have no master mind by any means,\n     but have worked out many a difficult problem in school for\n     my science prof.\n\n     Your magazine is a wiz. I haven't missed an instalment\n     since it started. Give us more stories like \"Monsters of\n     Moyen,\" and \"The Beetle Horde.\"--Josephine Frankhouser, 4949\n     Chestnut St., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n_\"Pretty Good\"_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I received Astounding Stories for May and it is pretty good.\n     The next issue is number six, and I hope it is better than\n     the previous ones. There have been some stories that do not\n     belong in a Science Fiction magazine, such as: \"The Cave of\n     Horror,\" \"The Corpse on the Grating,\" \"The Soul Master,\" and\n     \"The Man who was Dead.\" There is also another story that was\n     printed in the May issue that, so far as I think, does not\n     belong in this magazine: that is, \"Murder Madness.\"\n\n     Even all the other stories seem to be fantastic. Weird. Why\n     not try to publish something on the H. G. Wells, E. R.\n     Burroughs type of stories, also Ray Cummings' \"The Man who\n     Mastered Time,\" or \"The Time Machine,\" by Wells?--Louis\n     Wentzler, 1933 Woodbine St., Brooklyn, N. Y.\n\n\n_From Ye Reader_\n\n     Dear Ye Ed.:\n\n     That sounds rather medieval a little for the editor of so\n     novel a magazine, but nevertheless let's forget that and\n     talk about some astounding stories.\n\n     First, I would suggest that you eliminate all stories of\n     interplanetary travel (I would be different), as there are\n     already several magazines on the market which deal almost\n     exclusively with such stories. Now, tales like \"The Beetle\n     Horde,\" and those written by Murray Leinster, and those\n     concerning that Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bird, and those about\n     the deep sea, like \"Into the Ocean's Depths,\"--such stories\n     are astounding, and good. And once in a while let's have a\n     humorous story. You know: \"A bit of humor now and then--\"\n\n     Well, anyhow, publish any kind of astounding story, just so\n     it is different and does not deal with interplanetary\n     travel.\n\n     Now, about the magazine. I think it is a good publication\n     and I like it werra, werra mooch. I bought it on impulse and\n     happened to be lucky enough to get the first issue, and nary\n     an issue have I missed since. Although I possess an abject\n     horror of any kind of insect, I enjoyed \"The Beetle Horde\"\n     to the fullest extent. But here's hoping nothing like that\n     will really happen.\n\n     Another thing I'd like to state is this: Some reader made a\n     remark about not publishing any of Verne's works. I say you\n     should. Why should any such great author be disregarded in\n     so good a magazine? And is it not interesting to note that\n     some of his stories have become actual realizations? Even\n     Poe's should be published. All those dead authors whose\n     stories would be considered good were they living. Why\n     should any person ask not to have such good stories in your\n     magazine? Perhaps there are some people who would enjoy\n     them, but do not have the means nor time to buy these great\n     works in book form. Think it over, ye Ed., think it over.\n\n     And now, to finish up, I'll say: are there any readers like\n     me--a girl--or do only men and boys read Astounding\n     Stories?--Gertrude Hemken, 5730 So. Ashland Ave., Chicago,\n     Ill.\n\n\n_Short--and Sweet_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Congratulations! Have followed up every issue of Astounding\n     Stories and have found them the best yet.

They give me a great \"kick.\"\n\n     I think \"The Moon Master\" was the best story I ever read.\n     Please ask Mr. Diffin to write more like it.\n\n     But then all the stories are really peppy.--Jack Hudson, St.\n     Mark's School, Southborough, Massachusetts.\n\n\n_\"Undoubtedly the Best\"_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Your magazine is undoubtedly the best Science Fiction \"mag\"\n     on the stands. Why? Because of your authors. There is not\n     another Science Fiction book on the stands that has stories\n     by Victor Rousseau, Murray Leinster Ray Cummings, A. T.\n     Locke, A. J. Burks, C. W. Diffin, S. W. Ellis and many\n     others.\n\n     Some of your readers want stories by Dr. David H. Keller, Ed\n     Earl Repp and Walter Kately. Well, I just wanted to tell you\n     that I have stopped reading all other Science Fiction \"mags\"\n     on account of the frequency of these authors in them. So\n     please, please, don't destroy my last stronghold.\n\n     Also, I would not be against reprints. There is only one so\n     far who has objected to reprints, while there have been\n     several asking you to reprint A. Merritt's \"People of the\n     Pit.\" It would not only satisfy your present readers, but,\n     because of the great popularity of A. Merritt among the\n     reading circles of to-day, it would gain for you many more\n     readers.\n\n     Harl Vincent is an indispensable acquisition to \"our\"\n     magazine. His stories are not only all excellent but his\n     stories all contain good science. He will bring you many new\n     readers.\n\n     May I add my voice to every other reader's in the cry for\n     the reprinting of \"People of the Pit,\" by A. Merritt? Why\n     not give us some stories by him? He's pretty near the best\n     writer living to-day.\n\n     I don't care for the Mars stories by Burroughs. He's too\n     much long sword and short sword. A Merritt, however, is the\n     man for you to get and keep.\n\n     The schedule for July looks \"doggone good\" and suggestive to\n     the imagination. You might increase the contents of the\n     book.\n\n     The only thing wrong with the stories is that you have too\n     many repetitions. Please get A. Merritt. If you publish\n     stories by him you will see a very noticeable increase in\n     your subscription column. Another author who would repeat A.\n     Merritt's action on your subscription column is Dr. Edward\n     Elmer Smith. Please see about these authors.--Gabriel\n     Kirschner, Box 301, Temple, Texas.\n\n\n_From Young Miss Nightingale_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have been wanting to write to you for a long time but only\n     now am I able to do so. When I first got a copy of your\n     magazine I just grabbed it and started reading it. That\n     magazine had the first installment of \"Brigands of the Moon\"\n     in it. Now, after one magazine has been read I nearly burst\n     until the next one comes.\n\n     As for the writers, I like Ray Cummings, Harl Vincent,\n     Sewell Peaslee Wright, and Murray Leinster best. I like\n     interplanetary stories best. I also like stories of the\n     Fourth Dimension and those of ancient races of people living\n     in uninhabited parts of the earth. So far I have liked\n     especially well \"The Ray of Madness,\" \"Cold Light,\" \"From\n     the Ocean Depths\" and its sequel \"Into the Ocean's Depths,\"\n     \"Brigands of the Moon,\" and \"Murder Madness.\" Of course, I\n     like the others too.

Wessolowski_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have just finished the June issue of Astounding Stories.\n     It contained some very interesting stories, such as\n     \"Brigands of the Moon,\" by Ray Cummings, \"The Moon Master,\"\n     by Charles W. Diffin, \"Murder Madness,\" by Murray Leinster,\n     and \"Giants of the Ray,\" by Tom Curry. Although \"Out of the\n     Dreadful Depths,\" by C. D. Willard, was a good story, it\n     does not belong in a Science Fiction magazine.\n\n     One of the best improvements you could make on Astounding\n     Stories right now is to cut all edges smooth. I would like\n     to see at least one full page picture with each story.\n\n     Wesso is the only good artist you have. Is Wessolowski his\n     real name?--Jack Darrow, 4225 N. Spaulding Avenue, Chicago,\n     Illinois.\n\n\nAnent Reincarnation.\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     In the July issue of Astounding Stories, a correspondent,\n     Worth K. Bryant, asks some thought-provoking questions about\n     the fascinating subject of reincarnation. Although I have\n     written to Mr. Bryant personally, I would like to present my\n     views on the subject to all your readers.\n\n     Mr. Bryant asks: \"Could a person remember his own death in a\n     former reincarnation?\" Yes, he could--if he could \"tune in\"\n     on his higher consciousness, or ego. Were that possible, he\n     could see all his past lives from beginning to end. It is\n     only the physical self that dies; the ego, or true self, is\n     immortal and remembers everything that it has experienced in\n     previous incarnations on the physical plane. But since\n     consciousness on this plane is expressed through the\n     material brain, most human beings are unable to recall their\n     former visits to this world; and it is perhaps better so. If\n     there were not loss of memory our minds would now range over\n     the adventures of thousands of years in the past. It would\n     encompass a vast drama with countless loves and hates, of\n     many lives filled with pathos and tragedy. Thus to distract\n     the mind from the present life would retard our progress.\n     There will come a time in human evolution when the average\n     person will be able to recall his past incarnations, and\n     then there will be no need or argument that we have lived\n     here before, because everyone will remember it.\n\n     For those who care to pursue this subject more fully, I\n     recommend \"Elementary Theosophy,\" by L. W. Rogers,\n     obtainable at most public libraries.--Allen Glasser, 1610\n     University Ave., New York, N. Y.\n\n\n_Prefers the Longer Stories_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I've been reading your excellent periodical since the first\n     issue, and I feel that I'm entitled to an opportunity to\n     give expression to my reactions to the various issues. Of\n     course, as a whole, the magazines were uniformly good every\n     month, but some of the stories, naturally, were better than\n     others.\n\n     In the January issue the best story was \"The Beetle Horde\"\n     by Victor Rousseau. I expected a lot from this writer,\n     having read his \"Draft of Eternity,\" \"The Eye of Balamok\"\n     and \"The Messiah of the Cylinder.\" I wasn't disappointed.\n\n     The best story in the February issue was \"Spawn of the\n     Stars,\" by Charles Willard Diffin. Diffin is a newcomer as\n     far as I know, but he certainly can write.\n\n     \"Vandals of the Stars\" took the honors in the March issue.\n     A. T. Locke has written some good adventure shorts, but this\n     was his first fantastic story, to the best of my knowledge.\n     Come again, Locke! \"Brigands of the Moon,\" by Ray Cummings\n     was great too.\n\n     The best for April was \"Monsters of Moyen,\" by Arthur J.\n     Burks. Clever idea.\n\n     Victor Rousseau rang the bell again in the May issue with\n     \"The Atom Smasher.\" Let's have other stories of\n     time-travel--some into the very remote past. Cave man stuff,\n     you know!\n\n     \"The Moon Master,\" by Charles Willard Diffin was the best\n     for June. Diffin is one of your best writers.\n\n     In the last (July) issue, \"The Forgotten Planet,\" by Sewell\n     Peaslee Wright, I think, takes first place, though\n     hard-pressed by \"Earth, the Marauder\" and \"The Power and the\n     Glory.\"\n\n     Now for a few suggestions. In the first place, let's have\n     less short stories, and more longer ones. In my choice of\n     stories for each issue, with one exception, I picked the\n     novelettes. My reason for so doing is the fact that the\n     authors apparently are not able to do justice to their\n     themes in the shorter lengths. Of course, there are\n     exceptions, like Diffin's \"The Power and the Glory.\"\n\n     My second suggestion in this: Why not have a fixed position\n     for your announcement of the stories for the next issue? The\n     last page, for example. This would be more convenient for\n     the readers; besides, those of us who have \"our mags\" bound\n     into volumes could then cut out the announcement.\n\n     Finally, my third suggestion--and the real reason for my\n     writing this letter. Don't you think it would be a good idea\n     to publish in each issue the picture of one of the authors,\n     and a short synopsis of his life? How he started writing,\n     his experiences, etc. I'm certain that I'm not the only\n     reader who's interested in the authors. I hope, if\n     everything else I've said is ignored, you'll at least give\n     the last suggestion serious consideration.\n\n     Why not get the opinion of other readers?\n\n     Continued and increasing success to Astounding Stories, best\n     of the Science Fiction magazines!--P. A. Lyter, 220 Peffer\n     Street, Harrisburg, Pa.\n\n\n_Mr. Bates Accepts with Pleasure_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     It is with greatest pleasure I note the addition of Miss\n     Lilith Lorraine to your staff, and her initial effort in\n     your publication. \"The Jovian Jest\" is but a glimpse of what\n     is to come. The stories which she has written heretofore\n     have been real gems of Science Fiction. May I again\n     congratulate you.\n\n     The Science Correspondence Club takes great pleasure in\n     announcing the enrollment of Capt. S. P. Meek and R. F.\n     Starzl as members. These authors are well-known to\n     Astounding Stories readers. Also, we take pleasure in\n     announcing that we have asked Mr. Bates to become an\n     honorary member in recognition of his fine work in\n     furthering Science Fiction.\n\n     Our first bulletin has been issued and real progress is\n     started. For those interested, Mr. Raymond A. Palmer at\n     1431--34th St., Milwaukee, Wisconsin, will handle all\n     inquiries.\n\n     In closing, let me say that when a story pleases you\n     readers, or the work of some author impresses you, write to\n     the editor and tell him about it. In this way more and\n     better Science Fiction will appear. Let us all give\n     Astounding Stories a big hand, you readers! Best wishes of\n     the Science Correspondence Club and--Walter L. Dennis, F. P.\n     S., 4653 Addison St., Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n_\"Bargain\"_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have just finished \"The Atom Smasher,\" in your May issue\n     of Astounding Stories, and liked it very much.\n\n     This is the first story that I have read in your magazine,\n     although I have read other magazines for the past three\n     years.\n\n     I see where you inquire as to the kind of stories your\n     readers want.\n\n     Personally, I think stories of interplanetary travel are the\n     best, and most demanded by readers of Science Fiction. Try\n     and have one in each issue.\n\n     In my opinion, I see no criticisms to be made on your\n     magazine. It certainly would be a bargain at several times\n     the price you ask. I am sure I will continue reading\n     it--Louis D. Buchanan, Jr., 711 Monroe Ave., Evansville,\n     Indiana.\n\n\n_No \"Flash in the Pan\"_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     When I bought the first issue of Astounding Stories last\n     December, I was impressed by its array of splendid stories\n     and famous authors. I thought, then, that perhaps that first\n     number was just a flash in the pan, and that succeeding\n     issues would sink to the level of other Science Fiction\n     magazines. Happily, I was wrong. Astounding Stories has more\n     than fulfilled the promise of its initial issue. The stories\n     are undoubtedly the finest of their kind, and written by the\n     most prominent Science Fiction authors of the day. I cannot\n     conceive of any possible improvement in the magazine.\n\n     I do wish, though, that you would not heed the gratuitous\n     advice of certain earnest but misguided correspondents. For\n     instance, in the June issue, one Warren Williams of Chicago,\n     suggests that you enlarge the magazine and give each story a\n     full-page illustration, like other Science Fiction\n     periodicals. Mr. Williams evidently favors standardization.\n     As one magazine is, so must the rest be. Please ignore this\n     request, and others like it. Astounding Stories is\n     different, unique; just keep it that way, and you will never\n     lack a host of satisfied readers.\n\n     Before closing, I must voice my profound admiration for\n     Murray Leinster's brilliant and engrossing story, \"Murder\n     Madness.\" It's the best serial you've printed so far; though\n     I have high anticipation for Arthur J. Burks' latest novel,\n     \"Earth, the Marauder.\"--Mortimer Weisinger, 3550 Rochambeau\n     Ave., Bronx, New York.\n\n\n_\"I Mean Increased\"_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I wish to thank you for your reply to my letter. I did not\n     expect you to give me a personal reply: that was why I asked\n     you to reply to me in \"The Readers' Corner.\" You are the\n     only editor I have ever known of that goes to the trouble to\n     giving personal replies to readers. Other magazines require\n     a nominal fee. That's another score for you!\n\n     Your personal letter, as a girl would aptly say, \"tickled me\n     all over.\"\n\n     I am sorry I can't get a subscription just yet, but I am\n     \"bound\" to my newsdealer a little while yet, as I\n     immediately gave him a monthly order for Astounding Stories.\n\n     If you are the one who picked the authors, you have the best\n     taste I have ever seen in one person. But couldn't your\n     taste be improved? Pardon me, I mean increased. Namely,\n     please add to your taste: H. P. Lovecraft and Robert E.\n     Howard.\n\n     If you had different authors, in other words, new,\n     inexperienced authors, I would object to your running more\n     than one serial at a time, but with the marvelous old-timers\n     I have no objections, for they can write long ones far\n     better than they can the shorts. So keep them at work.\n\n     The three short stories, \"Out of the Dreadful Depths,\" \"The\n     Cavern World\" and \"Giants of the Ray,\" were all very good.\n     Ray Cummings was wonderful in the way he handled his\n     \"Brigands of the Moon.\" It was a \"wow baby.\" \"Murder\n     Madness\" is a great improvement over \"Tanks.\" \"Tanks\" was\n     the worst I've ever read by Leinster. But he came out of his\n     reverie in \"Murder Madness.\" It's great.\n\n     Sewell Peaslee Wright can work wonders with short stories.\n     Keep his \"typer\" clicking. By the way, may I say a few good\n     words for Sophie Wenzel Ellis? If she can duplicate\n     \"Creatures of the Light,\" maker her repeat.\n\n     Victor Rousseau's story, \"The Beetle Horde,\" kept me \"all\n     het up\" throughout. \"The Atom Smasher\" was excellent. I also\n     greatly like stories of the mighty Atlantis.\n\n     I agree with others of your readers that you should not let\n     Astounding Stories be printed in such a small size. Make it\n     a little larger, and give us smoother paper, and you will\n     prosper greatly.\n\n     \"The Moon Master\" was excellent.--Gabriel Kirschner, Box\n     301, Temple, Texas.\n\n\n_\"Could Kick Myself\"_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have just started reading Astounding Stories and could\n     kick myself for not seeing it sooner. In your latest issue,\n     \"The Moon Master,\" by Charles Diffin, is great. He sure\n     knows how to write adventure with science.\n\n     I am a member of the Science Corresponding Club and am glad\n     to say it. In later years the club will be known just like\n     other big clubs of to-day, \"Nationally and\n     Sciencelly.\"--John Marcroft, 32 Washington St., Central\n     Falls, R. I.\n\n\n_A Full List_\n\n     In the January number of Astounding Stories Cummings'\n     \"Phantom of Reality\" was the best, followed by Rousseau's\n     \"Beetle Horde.\"\n\n     February: 1--Diffin's \"Spawn of the Stars\"; 2--Rousseau's\n     \"Beetle Horde\"; 3--Ellis' \"Creatures of the Light\";\n     4--Meek's \"The Thief of Time.\"\n\n     March: 1--Cummings' \"Brigands of the Moon\"; 2--Locke's\n     \"Vandals of the Stars\"; 3--Meek's \"Cold Light.\"\n\n     April: 1--Cummings' \"Brigands of the Moon\"; 2--Burk's\n     \"Monsters of Moyen\"; 3--Meek's \"Ray of Madness\";\n     4--Pelcher's \"Vampires of Venus.\"\n\n     May: 1--Cummings' \"Brigands of the Moon\"; 2--Leinster's\n     \"Murder Madness\"; 3--Rousseau's \"Atom Smasher.\"\n\n     June: 1--Cummings' \"Brigands of the Moon\"; 2--Leinster's\n     \"Murder Madness\"; 3--Diffin's \"Moon Master.\"\n\n     Please give us a story by H. P. Lovecraft, if you can get\n     one.--Carl Ballard, 202 N. Main St., Danville, Va.\n\n\n_\"Words Cannot Express\"_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have read your wonderful magazine since it was first\n     published, and words cannot express what a fine magazine I\n     think it is. All my life, I have hoped that someone would\n     publish a magazine just like Astounding Stories. A magazine\n     just full to the brim with the right kind of stories;\n     thrilling stories of super-science, well written in plain\n     and convincing English by wide awake authors.\n\n     I thought that \"The Cavern World\" was a whiz of a story, and\n     \"The Moon Master\" was so exciting that I sat up late at\n     night reading it. Let's have more of that kind of science\n     story, that thrills every red-blooded American.\n\n     I hope that you print your magazine on better paper.--David\n     Bangs, 190 Marlboro St., Boston, Mass.\n\n\n_Unconvinced_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I received the latest issue of Astounding Stories, and in\n     looking it through I noticed your comments on reprints. Your\n     argument can easily be shot full of holes, and that's what I\n     intend to do.\n\n     First: Those stories being printed now are far inferior to\n     the reprints. Even your best stories, such as \"Murder\n     Madness\" and \"Brigands of the Moon,\" cannot be compared with\n     such stories as \"Station X,\" \"The Moon Pool,\" \"The Metal\n     Monster,\" or \"The Columbus of Space\" and \"The Second\n     Deluge.\"\n\n     Second: The Saturday Evening Post cannot be compared with\n     our magazine, for all the stories printed in it can be\n     obtained in book form, while the scientific novels are\n     almost all out of print.\n\n     Third: There is surely more than one out of a hundred who\n     haven't read the reprints. Just because some have read them\n     is no reason that they don't want them. I know, for I have a\n     large library of reprints and have read, and own, almost\n     every one of them, yet I would gladly see them again.\n\n     Fourth: The authors need not starve. You could easily devote\n     just a small space for reprints, and many would pay\n     twenty-five cents for the magazine.\n\n     The fairest and most American idea would be to let your\n     readers vote for this. Here is vote No. 1 for\n     reprints.--Woodrow Gelman, 1603 President St., Brooklyn, N. Y.\n\n\n_Praise and Suggestions_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have just finished the July issue of Astounding Stories\n     and classify the stories as follows:\n\n     \"Beyond the Heaviside Layer,\" good; \"Earth, the Marauder,\"\n     excellent, best in issue; \"From an Amber Block,\" fairly\n     good; \"The Terror of Air-Level Six,\" very good; \"The\n     Forgotten Planet,\" excellent; \"The Power and the Glory,\"\n     good; \"Murder Madness,\" very good, but not so much so as\n     preceding chapters.\n\n     Now for a few criticisms:\n\n     1. Your magazine (or should I say \"our\" magazine?) is too\n     small. Of course, it would be a radical change to make it\n     larger, but, like others, I think in the end you would gain\n     rather than lose by it. Most small magazines are cheap\n     affairs, and to have Astounding Stories small brands it as a\n     cheap type of magazine. Small magazines are more likely to\n     be hidden on the newsstands by larger ones, and in most\n     stores the large magazines have the more advantageous\n     positions.\n\n     2. The edges of your pages are uneven. You look in the index\n     and find an interesting story is on, for example, page 56.\n     You skim the pages to find it, and from page 43 you find\n     yourself suddenly at page 79. Make the paper more even,\n     please.\n\n     3. Don't have advertisements before the stories. Have them\n     in the rear.\n\n     4. Have a full page illustration facing the beginning of\n     each story. If at the end of a story you find pages won't\n     turn up right, continue the last page to the back of the\n     book.\n\n     Wesso is excellent. Another good artist is Paul, who draws\n     for another Science Fiction magazine. Your cover\n     illustrations are fine.\n\n     Summary: Enlarge size of magazine, smooth edges of paper,\n     have advertisements in rear of book, use full page\n     illustrations.\n\n     If this is expensive, you could charge twenty-five cents\n     instead of twenty cents, and I, for one, would be glad to\n     pay the extra nickel as I do for other magazines of Science\n     Fiction.--Robert Baldwin, 1427 Judson Ave., Evanston,\n     Illinois.\n\n\n_\"The Readers' Corner\"_\n\nAll Readers are extended a sincere and cordial invitation to \"come\nover to 'The Readers' Corner'\" and join in our monthly discussion of\nstories, authors, scientific principles and possibilities--everything\nthat's of common interest in connection with our Astounding Stories.\n\nAlthough from time to time the Editor may make a comment or so, this\nis a department primarily for _Readers_, and we want you to make full\nuse of it.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
