Each was\ncomposed of representatives duly apportioned by popular vote between\nthe two contending parties. Executive direction was provided by a\nvariety of Secretaries, selected by vote of the appropriate Councils.\nAn independent Judiciary upheld the laws.\n\nA unified Earth sent colonists to the stars. Back came strange tales\nand improbable animals.\n\nBack, too, came word of a burgeoning technological civilization on the\nplanet Itra, peopled by entirely humanoid aliens.\n\nEarth felt it would be wise for Itra to join in a Galactic Federation\nand accordingly, submitted the terms of such a mutually advantageous\nagreement.\n\nThe Itraians declined....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpace Captain Merle S. Shaeffer, the youngest and perhaps the most\nnaive pilot for Trans-Universe Transport, was called unexpectedly to\nthe New York office of the company.\n\nWhen Capt. Shaeffer entered the luxurious eightieth story suite, Old\nTom Twilmaker, the President of TUT, greeted him. With an arm around\nhis shoulder, Old Tom led Capt. Shaeffer to an immense inner office and\nintroduced him to a General Reuter, identified as the Chairman of the\nInterscience Committee of the Over-Council.\n\nNo one else was present. With the door closed, they were isolated in\nOlympian splendor above and beyond the affairs of men. Here judgments\nwere final and impartial. Capt. Shaeffer, in the presence of two of the\nmen highest in the ruling councils of Earth, was reduced to incoherent\nawe.\n\nGeneral Reuter moved about restlessly. Old Tom was serene and beatific.\n\nWhen they were seated, Old Tom swiveled around and gazed long\nin silence across the spires of the City. Capt. Shaeffer waited\nrespectfully. General Reuter fidgetted.\n\n\"Some day,\" Old Tom said at last, \"I'm going to take my leave of this.\nYes, gentle Jesus! Oh, when I think of all the souls still refusing\nto admit our precious Savior, what bitterness, oh, what sorrow is my\nwealth to me! Look down upon the teeming millions below us. How many\nknow not the Lord? Yes, some morning, I will forsake all this and go\nout into the streets to spend my last days bringing the words of hope\nto the weary and oppressed. Are you a Christian, Merle?\"\n\nGeneral Reuter cracked his knuckles nervously while Capt. Shaeffer\nmuttered an embarrassed affirmative.\n\n\"I am a deeply religious man,\" Old Tom continued. \"I guess you've heard\nthat, Merle?\"\n\n\"Yes sir,\" Capt. Shaeffer said.\n\n\"But did you know that the Lord has summoned you here today?\" Old Tom\nasked.\n\n\"No, sir,\" Capt. Shaeffer said.\n\n\"General Reuter, here, is a dear friend. We've known each other, oh,\nmany years. Distantly related through our dear wives, in fact. And we\nserve on the same Board of Directors and the same Charity Committees....\nA few weeks ago, when he asked me for a man, I called for your file,\nMerle. I made discreet inquiries. Then I got down on my knees and\ntalked it over with God for, oh, it must have been all of an hour. I\nasked, 'Is this the man?' And I was given a sign. Yes! At that moment,\na shaft of sunlight broke through the clouds!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGeneral Reuter had continued his nervous movements throughout the\nspeech. For the first time, he spoke. \"Good God, Tom, serve us a\ndrink.\" He turned to Capt. Shaeffer. \"A little drink now and then helps\na man relax. I'll just have mine straight, Tom.\"\n\nOld Tom studied Capt. Shaeffer. \"I do not feel the gentle Master\napproves of liquor.\"\n\n\"Don't try to influence him,\" General Reuter said. \"You're embarrassing\nthe boy.\"\n\n\"I--\" Capt. Shaeffer began.\n\n\"Give him the drink. If he doesn't want to drink it, he won't have to\ndrink it.\"\n\nSighing, Old Tom poured two bourbons from the bar in back of his desk\nand passed them over. Martyrdom sat heavily upon his brow.\n\nAfter a quick twist of the wrist and an expert toss of the head,\nGeneral Reuter returned an empty glass. \"Don't mind if I do have\nanother,\" he said. He was already less restless.\n\n\"How's your ability to pick up languages?\" General Reuter asked.\n\n\"I learned Spanish and Russian at TUT PS,\" Capt. Shaeffer said\napologetically. \"I'm supposed to have a real high aptitude in\nlanguages, according to some tests I took. In case we should meet\nintelligent aliens, TUT gives them.\"\n\n\"You got no association with crackpot organizations, anything like\nthat?\" General Reuter asked. \"You're either a good Liberal-Conservative\nor Radical-Progressive, aren't you? I don't care which. I don't believe\nin prying into a man's politics.\"\n\n\"I never belonged to anything,\" Capt. Shaeffer said.\n\n\"Oh, I can assure you, that's been checked out very, very thoroughly,\"\nOld Tom said.\n\nThe General signaled for another drink. With a sigh of exasperation,\nOld Tom complied.\n\n\"Bob,\" Old Tom said, \"I really think you've had enough. Please, now.\nOur Master counsels moderation.\"\n\n\"Damn it, Tom,\" the General said and turned back to the space pilot.\n\"May have a little job for you.\"\n\nOld Tom shook his head at the General, cautioning him.\n\n\"Actually,\" the General said, ignoring the executive, \"we'll be sort of\nrenting you from TUT. In a way you'll still be working for them. I can\nget a million dollars out of the--\"\n\n\"Bob!\"\n\n\"--unmarked appropriation if it goes in in TUT's name. No questions\nasked. National Defense. I couldn't get anywhere near that much for\nan individual for a year. It gives us a pie to slice. We were talking\nabout it before you came in. How does a quarter of a million dollars a\nyear sound to you?\"\n\n\"When it comes to such matters,\" Old Tom interjected hastily, \"I think\nfirst of the opportunities they bring to do good.\"\n\nThe General continued, \"Now you know, Merle. And this is serious. I\nwant you to listen to me. Because this comes under World Security laws,\nand I'm going to bind you to them. You know what that means? You'll be\nheld responsible.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Merle said, swallowing stiffly. \"I understand.\"\n\n\"Good. Let's have a drink on that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Please be quiet, General,\" Old Tom said. \"Let me explain. You see,\nMerle, the Interscience Committee was recently directed to consider\nmethods for creating a climate of opinion on Itra--of which I'm sure\nyou've heard--which would be favorable to the proposed Galactic\nFederation.\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" General Reuter said. \"They don't have a democracy, like\nwe do. They don't have any freedom like we do. I have no doubt the\naverage whateveryoucallem--Itraians, I guess--the average gooks--would\nbe glad to see us come in and just kick the hell out of whoever is in\ncharge of them.\"\n\n\"Now, General,\" Old Tom said more sharply.\n\n\"But that's not the whole thing,\" the General continued. \"Even fit were\nright thing to do, an' I'm not saying isn't--right thing to do--there's\nlog-lo-lo-gistics. I don't want to convey the impresh, impression that\nour Defense Force people have been wasting money. Never had as much as\nneeded, fact. No, it's like this.\n\n\"We have this broad base to buil' from. Backbone. But we live in\na democracy. Now, Old Tom's Liberal-Conservative. And me, I'm\nRadical-Progresshive. But we agree on one thing: importance of strong\ndefense. A lot of people don' understan' this. Feel we're already\nspendin' more than we can afford. But I want to ask them, what's more\nimportant than the defense of our planet?\"\n\n\"General, I'm afraid this is not entirely germane,\" Old Tom said\nstiffly.\n\n\"Never mind that right now. Point is, it will take us long time to get\nthe serious nature of the menace of Itra across to the voters. Then,\nmaybe fifteen, twenty years.... Let's just take one thing. We don't have\nanywhere near enough troop transports to carry out the occupation of\nItra. You know how long it takes to build them? My point is, we may not\nhave that long. Suppose Itra should get secret of interstellar drive\ntomorrow, then where would we be?\"\n\nOld Tom slammed his fist on the desk. \"General, please! The boy isn't\ninterested in all that.\"\n\nThe General surged angrily to his feet. \"By God, that's what's wrong\nwith this world today!\" he cried. \"Nobody's interested in Defense.\nSpend only a measly twenty per cent of the Gross World Product on\nDefense, and expect to keep strong! Good God, Tom, give me a drink!\"\nApparently heresy had shocked him sober.\n\nOld Tom explained, \"The General is a patriot. We all respect him for\nit.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Capt. Shaeffer said.\n\nGeneral Reuter hammered his knuckles in rhythm on the table. \"The\ndrink, the drink, the drink! You got more in the bottle. I saw it!\"\n\nOld Tom rolled his eyes Heavenward and passed the bottle across. \"This\nis all you get. This is all I've got.\"\n\nThe General held the bottle up to the light. \"Should have brought my\nown. Let's hurry up and get this over with.\"\n\nOld Tom smiled the smile of the sorely beset and persecuted and said,\n\"You see, Merle, there's massive discontent among the population of\nItra. We feel we should send a man to the planet to, well, foment\nchange and, uh, hasten the already inevitable overthrow of the despotic\ngovernment. That man will be strictly on his own. The Government will\nnot be able to back him in any way whatsoever once he lands on Itra.\"\n\nThe General had quickly finished the bottle. \"You she,\" he interrupted,\n\"there's one thing they can't fight, an' that's an idea. Jus' one man\ngoes to Itra with the idea of Freedom, that's all it'll take. How\nmany men did it take to start the 'Merican Revolution? Jefferson. The\nRussian Revolution? Marx!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Old Tom said. \"One dedicated man on Itra, preaching the ideas of\nLiberty--liberty with responsibility and property rights under one God.\nThat man can change a world.\" Exhausted by the purity of his emotions,\nOld Tom sat back gasping to await the answer.\n\n\"A quarter of a million dollars a year?\" Capt. Shaeffer asked at length.\n\n\nII\n\nThe Itraians spoke a common language. It was somewhat guttural and\nhighly inflected. Fortunately, the spelling appeared to be phonetic,\nwith only forty-three characters being required. As near as anyone\ncould tell, centuries of worldwide communication had eliminated\nregional peculiarities. The speech from one part of Itra was not\ndistinguishable from that of another part.\n\nMost of the language was recovered from spy tapes of television\nprograms. A dictionary was compiled laborously by a special scientific\ntask force of the Over-Council. The overall program was directed\nand administered by Intercontinental Iron, Steel, Gas, Electricity,\nAutomobiles and Synthetics, Incorporated.\n\nIt took Shaeffer just short of three years to speak Itraian\nsufficiently well to convince non-Itraians that he spoke without accent.\n\nThe remainder of his training program was administered by a variety\nof other large industrial concerns. The training was conducted at a\nDefense Facility.\n\nAt the end of his training, Shaeffer was taken by special bus to the\nNew Mexican space port. A ship waited.\n\nThe car moved smoothly from the Defense Force Base, down the broad\nsixteen-lane highway, through the surrounding slum area and into Grants.\n\nSight of the slums gave Shaeffer mixed emotions.\n\nIt was not a feeling of superiority to the inhabitants; those he had\nalways regarded with a circumspect indifference. The slums were there.\nHe supposed they always would be there. But now, for the first time\nin his life, he could truly say that he had escaped their omnipresent\nthreat once and for all. He felt relief and guilt.\n\nDuring the last three years, he had earned $750,000.\n\nAs a civilian stationed on a Defense Force Base, he had, of course,\nto pay for his clothing, his food and his lodging. But the charge was\nnominal. Since he had been given only infrequent and closely supervised\nleaves, he had been able to spend, altogether, only $12,000.\n\nWhich meant that now, after taxes, he had accumulated in his savings\naccount a total of nearly $600,000 awaiting his return from Itra.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShaeffer's ship stood off Itra while he prepared to disembark.\n\nIn his cramped quarters, he dressed himself in Itraian-style clothing.\nCapt. Merle S. Shaeffer became Shamar the Worker.\n\nIn addition to his jump equipment, an oxygen cylinder, a face mask and\na shovel, he carried with him eighty pounds of counterfeit Itraian\ncurrency ... all told, forty thousand individual bills of various\ndenominations. Earth felt this would be all he needed to survive in a\ntechnologically advanced civilization.\n\nHis plan was as follows:\n\n1. He was to land in a sparsely inhabited area on the larger masses.\n\n2. He was to procure transportation to Xxla, a major city, equivalent\nto London or Tokyo. It was the headquarters for the Party.\n\n3. He was to establish residence in the slum area surrounding the\nUniversity of Xxla.\n\n4. Working through student contacts, he was to ingratiate himself with\nsuch rebel intellectuals as could be found.\n\n5. Once his contacts were secure, he was to assist in the preparation\nof propaganda and establish a clandestine press for its production.\n\n6. As quickly as the operation was self-sufficient, he was to move on\nto another major city ... and begin all over.\n\nThe ship descended into the atmosphere. The bell rang. Shamar the\nWorker seated himself, put on his oxygen mask and signaled his\nreadiness. He breathed oxygen. The ship quivered, the door fell away\nbeneath him and he was battered unconscious by the slipstream.\n\nFive minutes later, pinwheeling lazily in free fall, he opened\nhis eyes. For an instant's panic he could not read the altimeter.\nThen seeing that he was safe, he noted his physical sensations. He\nwas extremely cold. Gyrating wildly, he beat his chest to restore\ncirculation.\n\nHe stabilized his fall by stretching out his hands. He floated with no\nsensation of movement. Itra was overhead, falling up at him slowly. He\nturned his back to the planet and checked the time. Twelve minutes yet\nto go.\n\nHe spent, in all, seventeen minutes in free fall. At 2000 feet, he\nopened his parachute. The sound was like an explosion.\n\nHe floated quietly, recovering from the shock. He removed his oxygen\nmask and tasted the alien air. He sniffed several times. It was not\nunpleasant.\n\nBelow was darkness. Then suddenly the ground came floating up and hit\nhim.\n\nThe terrain was irregular. He fought the chute to collapse it, tripped,\nand twisted his ankle painfully.\n\nThe chute lay quiet and he sat on the ground and cursed in English.\n\nAt length he bundled up the chute and removed all of the packages of\nmoney but the one disguised as a field pack. He used the shovel to\ndig a shallow grave at the base of a tree. He interred the chute, the\noxygen cylinder, the mask, the shovel and scooped dirt over them with\nhis hands.\n\nHe sat down and unlaced his shoe and found his ankle badly swollen.\nDistant, unfamiliar odors filled him with apprehension and he started\nat the slightest sound.\n\nDawn was breaking.\n\n\nIII\n\nNoting his bearings carefully, he hobbled painfully westward, with\nthirty pounds of money on his back. He would intersect the major\nNorth-South Intercontinental highway by at least noon.\n\nTwo hours later, he came to a small plastic cabin in a clearing at the\nedge of a forest.\n\nWincing now with each step, he made his way to the door. He knocked.\n\nThere was a long wait.\n\nThe door opened. A girl stood before him in a dressing gown. She\nfrowned and asked, \"_Itsil obwatly jer gekompilp?_\"\n\nHearing Itraian spoken by a native in the flesh had a powerful\nemotional impact on Shamar the Worker.\n\nStumblingly, he introduced himself and explained that he was camping\nout. During the previous night he had become lost and injured his\nankle. If she could spare him food and directions, he would gladly pay.\n\nWith a smile of superiority, she stepped aside and said in Itraian,\n\"Come in, Chom the Worker.\"\n\nHe felt panic, but he choked it back and followed her. Apparently he\nhad horribly mispronounced his own name. It was as though, in English\nhe had said Barchestershire for Barset. He cursed whatever Professor\nhad picked that name for whatever obscure reason.\n\n\"Sit down,\" she invited. \"I'm about to have breakfast. Eggs and\nbacon--\" the Itraian equivalent--\"if that's all right with you. I'm\nGarfling Germadpoldlt by the way, although you can call me Ge-Ge.\"\n\nThe food was quite unpleasant, as though overly ripe. He was able to\nchoke down the eggs with the greatest difficulty. Fortunately, the hot\ndrink that was the equivalent of Earth coffee at the end of the meal,\nwas sufficiently spicy to quiet his stomach.\n\n\"Good coffee,\" he said.\n\n\"Thank you. Care for a cigarette?\"\n\n\"I sure would.\"\n\nHe had no matches, so she lit it for him, hovering above him a moment,\nleaving with him the fresh odor of her hair.\n\nThe taste of the cigarette was mild. Rather surprisingly, it\nsubstituted for nicotine and allayed the sharp longing that had come\nwith the coffee.\n\n\"Let's look at your ankle,\" she said. She knelt at his feet and began\nto unlace the right shoe. \"My, it's swollen,\" she said sympathetically.\n\nHe winced as she touched it and then he reddened with embarrassment. He\nhad been walking across dusty country. He drew back the foot and bent\nto restrain her.\n\nPlayfully she slapped his hand away. \"You sit back! I'll get it. I've\nseen dirty feet before.\"\n\nShe pulled off the shoe and peeled off the sock. \"Oh, God, it is\nswollen,\" she said. \"You think it's broken, Shamar?\"\n\n\"Just sprained.\"\n\n\"I'll get some hot water with some MedAid in it, and that'll take the\nswelling out.\"\n\nWhen he had his foot in the water, she sat across from him and arranged\nher dressing gown with a coquettish gesture. She caught him staring\nat the earring, and one hand went to it caressingly. She smiled that\nuniversal feminine smile of security and recklessness, of invitation\nand rejection.\n\n\"You're engaged,\" he noted.\n\nShe opened her eyes wide and studied him above a thumbnail which she\ntasted with her teeth. \"I'm engaged to Von Stutsman--\" as the name\nmight be translated--\"perhaps you've heard of him? He's important in\nthe Party. You know him?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You in the Party?\" she said. She was teasing him now. Then, suddenly:\n\"Neither am I, but I guess I'll have to join if I become Mrs. Von\nStutsman.\"\n\nThey were silent for a moment.\n\nThen she spoke, and he was frozen in terror, all thoughts but of\nself-preservation washed from his mind.\n\n\"Your accent is unbelieveably bad,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm from Zuleb,\" he said lamely, at last.\n\n\"Meta--Gelwhops--or even Karkeqwol, that makes no difference. Nobody on\nItra speaks like you do. So you must be from that planet that had the\nParty in a flap several years ago--Earth, isn't it?\"\n\nHe said nothing.\n\n\"Do you know what they'll do when they catch you?\" she asked.\n\n\"No,\" he said hollowly.\n\n\"They'll behead you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe laughed, not unkindly. \"If you could see yourself! How ridiculous\nyou look, Shamar. I wonder what your real name is, by the way? Sitting\nwith a foot in the water and looking wildly about. Here, let me fix\nmore coffee and we can talk.\"\n\nShe called cheerily over her shoulder, \"You're safe here. No one will\nbe by. I'm not due back until Tuesday.\"\n\nShe brought him a steaming mug. \"Drink this while I dress.\" She\ndisappeared into the bedroom. He heard the shower running.\n\nHe sat waiting, numb and desperate, and drank the coffee because it was\nthere. His thoughts scampered in the cage of his skull like mice on a\ntreadmill.\n\nWhen Ge-Ge came back, he had still not resolved the conflict within\nhim. She stood barefoot upon the rug and looked down at him, hunched\nmiserably over the pan of water, now lukewarm.\n\n\"How's the foot?\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\n\"Want to take it out?\"\n\n\"I guess.\"\n\n\"I'll get a towel.\"\n\nShe waited until he had dried the foot and restored the sock and shoe.\nThe swelling was gone. He stood up and put his weight on it. He smiled\nwanly. \"It's okay now. It's not broken, I guess.\"\n\nShe gestured him to the sofa. He complied.\n\n\"What's in the field pack?\" she asked. \"Money? How much?\" She moved\ntoward it. He half rose to stop her, but by then she had it partly\nopen. \"My,\" she said, bringing out a thick sheaf of bills. She rippled\nthem sensuously. \"Pretty. Very, very pretty.\" She examined them for\ntexture and appearance. \"They look good, Shamar. I'll bet it would cost\nten million dollars in research on paper and ink and presses to do this\nkind of a job. Only another government has got that kind of money to\nthrow around.\" She tossed the currency carelessly beside him and came\nto sit at his side.\n\nShe took his hand. Her hand was warm and gentle. \"Tell me, Shamar,\" she\nsaid. \"Tell me all about it.\"\n\nSo this is how easily spies are trapped in real life, Shamar told\nhimself with numb disbelief.\n\nThe story came out slowly and hesitantly at first. She said nothing\nuntil he had finished.\n\n\"And that's all? You really believe that, don't you? And I guess\nyour government does, too. That all we need is just some little idea\nor something.\" She turned away from him. \"But of course, that's\nneither here nor there, is it? I never imagined an adventurer type\nwould look like you. You have such a soft, honest voice. As a little\ngirl, I pictured myself being carried off by a tanned desert sheik on\na camel; and oh, he was lean and handsome! With dark flashing eyes\nand murderously heavy lips and hands like iron! Well, that's life, I\nguess.\" She stood and paced the room. \"Let me think. We'll pick up a\nflyer in Zelonip when we catch the bus next Tuesday. How much does the\nmoney weigh?\"\n\n\"Eighty pounds.\"\n\n\"I can carry about 10 pounds in my bag. You can take your field pack.\nHow much is in it? Thirty pounds? That'll leave about forty which we\ncan ship through on extra charges. Then, when we get to Xxla, I can\nhide you out in an apartment over on the East side.\"\n\n\"Why would you run a risk like that for me?\" he asked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe brushed the hair from her face. \"Let's say--what? I don't really\nthink you can make it, because it's so hopeless. But maybe, just maybe,\nyou might be one of the rare ones who, if he plays his cards right, can\nbeat the system. I love to see them licked!\n\n\"Well, I'm a clerk. That's all. Just a lowly clerk in one of the Party\noffices. I met Von Stutsman a year ago. This is his cabin. He lets me\nuse it.\n\n\"He's older than I am; but there's worse husband material. But then\nagain, he's about to be transferred to one of the big agricultural\ncombines way out in the boondocks where there's no excitement at all.\nJust little old ladies and little old men and peasants having children.\n\n\"I'm a city girl. I like Xxla. And if I marry him, all that goes up the\nflue. I'll be marooned with him, God knows where, for years. Stuck,\njust stuck.\n\n\"Still--he is Von Stutsman, and he's on his way up. Everyone says that.\nTen, twenty years, he'll be back to Xxla, and he'll come back on top.\n\n\"Oh ... I don't know what I want to do! If I marry him, I can get all\nthe things I've always wanted. Position, security. He's older than I\nam, but he's really a nice guy. It's just that he's dull. He can't talk\nabout anything but Party, Party, Party.\n\n\"That's what I came out to this cabin for. To think things over, to try\nto get things straightened out. And then you came along. Maybe it gives\nme a chance for something exciting before I ship off to the boondocks.\nDoes that make sense to you?\n\n\"I'll get married and sit out there, and I'll turn the pages of the\nParty magazine and smile sweetly to myself. Because, you see, I'll\nalways be able to lean forward and say, 'Dear? Once upon a time, I\nhelped hide an Earth spy in Xxla.' And that'll knock that silly and\nself-satisfied look off his face for once.... Oh, I don't know! Let me\nalone!\" With that, she fled to the bedroom and slammed the door behind\nher.\n\nHe could hear her sobbing helplessly.\n\nIn the afternoon, she came out. He had fallen asleep. She shook him\ngently to waken him.\n\n\"Eh? Oh! Huh?\" He smiled foolishly.\n\n\"Wash up in there,\" she told him. \"I'm sorry I blew up on you this\nmorning. I'll cook something.\"\n\nWhen he came back, she was serving them their dinner on steaming\nplatters.\n\n\"Look, Ge-Ge,\" he said over coffee. \"You don't like your government.\nWe'll help you out. There's this Galactic Federation idea.\" He\nexplained to her the cross-fertilization of the two cultures.\n\n\"Shamar, my friend,\" she said, \"did you see Earth's proposal? There was\nnothing in it about giving us an interstellar drive. We were required\nto give Earth all transportation franchises. The organization you used\nto work for was to be given, as I remember it, an exclusive ninety-nine\nyear right to carry all Earth-Itra commerce. It was all covered in the\nnewspapers, didn't you see it?\"\n\nShamar said, \"Well, now, I'm not familiar with the details. I wasn't\nkeeping up with them. But I'm sure these things could be, you know,\nworked out. Maybe, for Security reasons, we didn't want to give you the\ninterstellar drive right off, but you can appreciate our logic there.\nOnce we saw you were, well, like us, a peace-loving planet, once you'd\nchanged your government to a democracy, you would see it our way and\nyou'd have no complaints on that score.\"\n\n\"Let's not talk politics,\" she said wearily. \"Maybe it's what you say,\nand I'm just naturally suspicious. I don't want to talk about it.\"\n\n\"Well, I was just trying to help--\"\n\nThe sentence was interrupted by a monstrous explosion.\n\n\"Good God!\" Shamar cried. \"What was that?\"\n\n\"Oh, that,\" Ge-Ge said, shaking off the effects. \"They were probably\ntesting one of their damned automated factories to see if it was\nexplosion proof and it wasn't.\"\n\n\nIV\n\nDuring the week alone in the cabin, Ge-Ge fell in love with Shamar.\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" she cried. \"What will I do when they catch you? I'll die,\nShamar! I couldn't bear it. We'll go to Xxla, we'll hide away as quietly\nas two mice, somewhere. We won't go out. The two of us, alone but\ntogether, behind closed doors and drawn shades. Nobody will ever know\nabout us. We'll be the invisible people.\"\n\nShamar protested. \"I don't see how we can ever be secure until\nsomething's done about your government. As long as you don't reach some\nkind of agreement with Earth, I'll be an outlaw. I'll be afraid any\nminute they'll tap my shoulder and come and take me away. I don't think\nwe could hold up under that. We'd be at each other in no time.\"\n\nShe wept quietly.\n\nThe last day in the cabin, they went out and dug up the rest of the\nmoney. The trip to Xxla took place without incident. Ge-Ge rented an\napartment for him, and he safely checked in. She went shopping for food\nand clothing.\n\nThereafter she came nearly every evening. They would eat and she would\nreveal the inconsequential details of the office regime to which she\nwas daily exposed. After dinner, they would sit in the living room and\npractice Itraian and neck a little. Then she would go home.\n\nOne day, after a month of this routine, she threw herself into his\narms and sobbed, \"I gave Von Stutsman back his earring today. It was\nthe only fair thing to do. I'm afraid he knows about us. He's had me\nwatched. I know he has. I admitted it was another man.\"\n\nShamar held her tensely.\n\nShe broke away. \"You were born in Zuleb, you suffered amnesia, you woke\nup in a ditch one morning without papers. You've been an itinerant\nworker since. Things like that happen all the time. You hit a big\nlottery ticket a few months ago. I told him that. How can he check it?\"\n\n\"You told him I didn't have any papers?\"\n\n\"Millions of people don't have any papers--the drifters, people that\ndo casual labor, the people that don't work at all. The thing is,\nwithout papers he doesn't have any way to check on you. Oh, you should\nhave seen his face when I gave him back his earring. He was absolutely\nlivid. I didn't think he had it in him. I suppose I'll have to quit my\njob now. Oh, if you only had papers so we could be married!\"\n\nGe-Ge's mood, that evening, alternated between despair and optimism. In\nthe end, she was morose and restless. She repeated several times, \"I\njust don't know what's going to happen to us.\"\n\n\"Ge-Ge,\" he said, \"I can't spend my life in this apartment I've got to\nget out.\"\n\n\"You're mad.\" She faced him from across the room. She stood with her\nlegs apart, firmly set. \"Well, I don't care what happens any more. I\ncan't stand things to go on like they are. I'll introduce you to some\npeople I know, since you won't be happy until I do. But God help us!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter approving his accent, which had improved under her tutelage,\nGe-Ge took him to a party the following Saturday.\n\nThe party was held in an ill-lighted railroad flat. People congregated\ncross-legged on the bare floor.\n\nShamar listened to a man complaining that citizens were being taxed\nbeyond all endurance to support the enforced automation program. \"They\naren't interested in building consumer goods. They're interested in\nbuilding factories to build consumer goods and blow them up testing\nthem. Or the factories are always obsolete just as soon as they finish\nthem, and they can't phase into their new production setup and Hundred\nYear Plan.\"\n\nGe-Ge whispered a warning to him to beware of spies.\n\n\"Spies?\"\n\n\"The Party,\" she said, drawing him to one side.\n\n\"But--but--you mean the Party just lets people talk like this?\"\n\n\"Whatever harm does it do?\" she asked. \"Everybody benefits from talking\nout their aggressions. Now, have another drink and relax, and Shamar,\nbe careful! Nobody minds local crackpots, but nobody wants _foreign_\ncrackpots!\"\n\nShe led him to another drink and left him standing with the host.\n\n\"Nice party,\" Shamar said.\n\n\"Thank you,\" the host said. \"I find it very invigorating. As long as\nthere's still people that think and that criticize on this planet, I\nfeel there's hope, don't you? This is your first time? I don't recall\nyour face. I have a study group that meets Wednesday nights. You're\nwelcome to come. We have very stimulating discussions about government\nand politics. Please do come, any time you can. Just drop in any time\nafter eight. What was your name again?\"\n\n\"Shamar the Worker.\"\n\n\"Interesting name,\" the host said. \"Another drink?\"\n\nLater, Shamar found himself in an intense conversation with a bearded\nyouth of perhaps seventeen.\n\n\"A guy's responsible for his own conduct, right? Right! I'm responsible\nfor _their_ conduct? Each man goes to hell in his own way, right?\nRight! I don't want anything to do with them. You can't do anything\nabout it, man, that's what I'm telling you. I don't seem to be getting\nthrough. Don't you see, it's a machine....\"\n\n\"But if everybody joined the Party,\" Shamar suggested.\n\n\"So everybody joins? So what's new? Okay, you vote in the Party\nelections. What do you get? You get these two guys running for office:\none is slightly left of center and one is slightly right of center. And\nboth are four-square for the Automated Factory Program. Just suppose\nyou did get a radical--suppose they accidentally let one slip through?\nHe goes off and they argue him into line, and when he comes back, you\nsay, 'Like, man, what happened?' And so he tells you, 'Well, I couldn't\ndo anything about it.' That's just what I'm telling you.\"\n\n\"I can't see that,\" Shamar said. \"I just don't believe that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt another time, Shamar tried to explain free elections to a female. He\nwas informed, \"Man, just give me a way to cast a vote against all those\ncrumbs--and then I'll think twice about all this guff you're peddling.\"\n\nA sober, scholarly man told him, \"Join the Party? Whatever for? You\njoin the Party and you're expected to spend all your free evenings at\nrallies and meetings and speeches and in ceremonial parades in honor of\nthe ground breaking for a new automated factory. No, thank you.\"\n\nAnother told him, \"You need a lesson in economics, son. What do you\nmean by free society? The only way you can run an industrial society\nis to limit production. If you produce enough for everybody, the\ngovernment would produce itself out of business. Look here. The\nParty has millions of tabulating machines of one kind or another\nclicking happily away day and night arranging production to fit income\ndistribution. They've never been known to goof and produce a surplus\nof anything. Why, damn it, if every man, woman and child in the world\nwent out to buy a pound of nails apiece, the shortage of nails would be\nfantastic. But would they produce more nails? You know they wouldn't.\n'So you want more nails?' they'd say. 'Well, damn you, work for them!'\nAnd the price would go up. See what I mean, son? They'd have another\nstick to beat us with.\"\n\nLater, Shamar found himself seated on the floor across from an\naesthetic in his late thirties. \"You see, my friend, force and violence\nnever accomplish their stated ends. We must stand firmly on the\nprinciple of non-violence.\"\n\n\"But that's taking it laying down,\" Shamar protested.\n\n\"No! Sometimes I think it goes to the very core of human existence.\nPerhaps this is the central import of all philosophy: the way things\nare done is more important than the ends that are obtained.\"\n\nAt that point, Ge-Ge arrived breathlessly. \"Shamar, quickly! We must\ngo!\"\n\n\"Huh? I'm having this interesting little talk--\"\n\nShe tugged him from the floor. Baffled, he followed her. As he did so,\nthe fighting broke out in the far corner of the room.\n\n\"Quickly!\" she said. \"Let's get out of here before the police come.\"\n\nThey fought their way, hand in hand, to the door. There they paused for\na moment to look back.\n\n\"It's a couple of rival socialist parties fighting,\" she explained\nbreathlessly.\n\n\"What about?\"\n\n\"God knows. Hurry.\"\n\nThey were in the street. \"Don't run, walk,\" she cautioned. After a\nblock, she said, \"I didn't even need to watch you at the end. Everybody\ngot so drunk nobody noticed you much.\"\n\n\"Even the spies?\"\n\n\"Oh, they always get the drunkest.\"\n\nThe siren sounded.\n\n\"Let's hurry.\"\n\nWhen they arrived at Shamar's apartment, she asked, \"Well, what did you\nthink of the party?\"\n\n\"It was an education,\" he said after a moment.\n\n\nV\n\nThe following week Shamar spent many hours walking the streets of Xxla.\nHe tried to convince himself that the people he had met at the party\nwere not representative.\n\nThey were.\n\nFriday night Ge-Ge announced \"Shamar, I can't stand much more of this!\nWhat's going to happen? What is Von Stutsman going to do? He's onto\nsomething. I sometimes wish--oh, God!--I sometimes wish something would\nhappen so we'd know where we stand, so we'd know what to do!\" He tried\nto put an arm around her, but she brushed it away. \"Don't! Let me\nalone!\"\n\nShe retired to the other side of the room. For a moment, and for no\nreason, the hostility in the air between them was like ice and fire.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Ge-Ge said curtly.\n\n\"That's all right,\" Shamar said, his voice cold and distant.\n\n\"Let's talk about something else.\"\n\nThey were silent for a minute. Then he said, \"I wanted to ask you. Of\nall the people I talked to, I couldn't find anyone who seemed to give\na damn, one way or the other, about Earth. Why is that? You'd think\nthey'd be at least talking about Earth.\"\n\n\"Why should they be? We've got our own problems.\"\n\nAt that point, the police arrived and took Shamar the Worker away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey put him in a cell in which there were already three other\nprisoners.\n\n\"What you in for, buddy?\"\n\nShamar studied the prisoner for a moment without answering. His\ncompanions looked up.\n\n\"No visible means of support,\" Shamar said.\n\n\"I'm Long John Freed.\"\n\nShamar nodded.\n\n\"They're trying to hook you for evading the productivity tax, huh?\"\n\nShamar declined comment.\n\nFreed settled back on his bunk. \"I say take them for all you can. Now,\nlook, you're a little guy. So they bleed us white. Take a factory\nmanager or an important Black Market operator--you think they pay\ntaxes? You can bet they don't. It's a racket. The poor pay and pay\nbecause they can't hire fancy lawyers to lie for them; and the rich\ntake and take. I don't see why the Party puts up with it.\"\n\nFreed shifted his position. \"Say what you will about the Party--and\nI know it's got it's faults--still, there are dedicated men in it. I\nmay be a small-time crook, but I'm as patriotic as the next man. The\nParty's done a lot of good.\n\n\"First time for you? How old are you, twenty-seven or so? First time,\nthey usually try to recruit you for the Factory Force.\n\n\"It's not such a bad racket. When you start out, they toss you in with\nlots of kids--usually the draftees. You get six weeks pick-and-shovel,\nand you're really dragging when you finish that. Then comes specialist\nschool.\n\n\"Try to get in as an electrician or plumber. Plasterers or bricklayers\nhave to work too hard. Carpentry's not bad--I'd hold out for\ncabinet-making, rather than rough carpentry, if I had to go into\nthat. Then there's real specialties. Tile laying. You have to have a\npersonality for that, or you'd go nuts. Demolition's not too bad; you\nblow up obsolete factories. That would have been right down my alley.\"\n\nFreed was silent a moment, then he resumed:\n\n\"Sometimes I may talk like a radical, and maybe I am a little of a\nradical, I don't know. You look at the overall picture, things ain't\ntoo bad. I've known a lot of thieves and petty crooks in my time. As a\nclass, for pure patriotism, I'll stack them up against anybody you can\nname; and in a way, you know, I'm kind of proud of that.... Well, let's\nshut up and get some shut-eye.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen finally he slept, Shamar dreamed that the Party was a vast,\ninvulnerable pyramid resting on the shifting base of the population. It\nwas constructed to dampen out vibrations. The bottom quivered, and the\nquiver ran upward a few inches and was absorbed. The top of the pyramid\nremained stable, fixed and motionless, indifferent even to its own\nfoundation. The pyramid was built like an earthquake-proof tower. It\nwas built to last. The Party was built to govern. It need only devote\nitself to its own preservation. Any other issue was secondary.\n\nIt was an organic machine. The gears were flesh and blood. The people\non top were maintenance engineers. Their job was to go around with an\noil can that they could squirt when necessary to keep friction to a\nminimum.\n\nHe awakened the following morning ravenously hungry and was hugely\ndisappointed by breakfast. Even discounting his somewhat biased\nviewpoint, the food was inedible.\n\nFreed accepted Shamar's share eagerly with the comment, \"It'll taste\nbetter after you miss a few meals. It always does.\"\n\nAn hour later, the jailer came to open the cell.\n\n\"Shamar the Worker? Get your stuff. We're going.\"\n\nGe-Ge was waiting in the reception room. Her hair had been especially\nwaved for the occasion. She wore a suit newly pressed and gleaming. She\nhad tears in her eyes.\n\nShe fled to his arms. \"Darling!\" she cried, caressing his face with\nchildlike wonder. \"Was it awful? Did they beat you?\"\n\n\"I'm fine.\"\n\n\"Darling, we're going to get you out on bail. I've made all the\narrangements. We just have to go to the Judge's chambers for a minute,\nand they'll let you go. Thank God you're going to be out of this\nhorrible place, at least for a little while.\"\n\nThe jailer brought Shamar's belt and his bag of possessions. Shamar\nsigned a receipt for them and they went to the Judge.\n\nThe Judge said, \"Please be seated.\" He had a resonant and friendly\nvoice. He went to his desk and sat down.\n\nGe-Ge and Shamar seated themselves before him.\n\n\"Ah, you young people,\" he said. \"Now, you must be Shamar the Worker,\nand you--\"\n\n\"Garfling Germadpoldlt.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" He turned to Shamar. \"I hate to see a fine young person\nlike you in trouble, Shamar. It seems to me such a waste. Man and boy,\nfor sixty years I've been a dedicated worker for the Party. Oh, Shamar,\nwhen I think of that glorious paradise to come--that time of wealth\nand plenty for all--that time when the riches and abundance of Mother\nItra will, from Automation, overflow alike the homes of the rich and\npoor....\"\n\nThey waited.\n\nHe continued. \"Here I sit, year after year, Garfling and Shamar,\njudging my fellow men. Judging poor creatures who do not live the\nDream. I sometimes feel that this is not the way. I sometimes feel my\njob is out there on the street corners, preaching the Dream, awakening\nthe souls, telling the story of love and beauty and abundance in the\nlife to come.\n\n\"Ah, me. But the world is not yet perfect, is it? And man's\nunderstanding is imperfect. Here you are before me today, Shamar, with\nno visible means of support and no record of having paid productivity\ntaxes. Oh, what a grim and fearful picture! In all your life have you\never once thought of your obligation to the future? You have failed\nyourself; you have failed the Party; and failed the future.\n\n\"Yet--in a larger sense--although this in no way militates against your\nown guilt--have we not failed you? How have we permitted a human soul\nto degrade himself to the point where we must punish him?\"\n\nAbruptly, the Judge stood up. \"Well, I've done the best I can. I remand\nyou to the custody of Miss Germadpoldlt. Your trial will be set at a\nlater date. You are not to leave Xxla without permission of this court.\nAnd I hope my lecture today has fallen on fertile soil. It is not too\nlate to correct your ways. And I may say, if I am the one who hears\nyour case, your conduct between now and the trial may have some bearing\non the outcome.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey took a taxi back to his apartment. Ge-Ge trembled violently most\nof the way and nestled against him; they murmured their affection.\n\nAfter he had been fed, she said nervously, \"It was Von Stutsman who was\nresponsible for your arrest. I should have known we couldn't fight the\nParty. If he digs hard enough, nothing on Itra can save us.\"\n\nFinally, she went out to canvas lawyers.\n\nShe came back at dusk.\n\n\"Shamar, darling,\" she said, \"I've located him. I asked a lot of my\nfriends, and he's the best. He's a big lawyer for left-wing people. I\ntalked to him, I told him everything.\"\n\n\"What! You told him everything?\"\n\n\"Why, yes.\"\n\n\"You, you told him I was an Earthman?\" He grabbed her by the shoulders.\n\"Listen, Ge-Ge! I was arrested on a charge I could beat; now look what\nyou've done. What makes you think he won't turn me over to the Party?\nThis is too big, now! This isn't just a tax avoidance matter, this is\ntreason for him.\"\n\n\"It's all right, darling,\" she said soothingly, breaking free from him.\n\"I had to tell him so he'd take the case. Why would a big man like him\nwant to defend a common vagrant?\"\n\nShamar closed his mouth. \"But--you mean, he won't tell anyone?\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\n\"Has the man no patriotism?\"\n\n\"Look, Shamar,\" she said in exasperation, \"you once asked me why the\npeople in the street aren't upset about Earth. I'm beginning to see the\nway you think. What you mean is, aren't we _afraid_ of Earth? Aren't\nwe afraid Earth would, oh, do something like invade us or something?\nThat's what you mean.\"\n\n\"Of course it is.\"\n\n\"Once upon a time,\" she said, \"when we first got space flight, the\nParty got all shook up about the possibility of some hostile force\nout there developing an interstellar drive and coming along and doing\ntheir will with us. They asked the computers about it. Invading and\nconquering a planet is such a vast technological undertaking that the\nmind just boggles at it. Don't forget, we've got a warning network out\nthere. They're not very alert, or you wouldn't have gotten through,\nbut they wouldn't miss an invasion fleet. There's computer-controlled\nchemical rockets in orbit, and we've got a few sited on Itra that can\nblast down anything that slows up to try to land. It wouldn't take\none-hundredth, it wouldn't take one-thousandth of the technological\nresources required to defend Itra that it would to attack her. Earth\njust simply can't afford to attack us. They'd go broke trying. Every\nmillion dollars you spent to get here, we'd spend a thousand to keep\nyou from landing.\n\n\"Oh, I suppose if Earth wanted to, they might figure out some way to\nblow up Itra. But where's the profit in that? We're not bothering you.\nWhy spend all that money when it's not going to get you one damn thing\nin return?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe following day, Shamar called on the lawyer, Counselor Freemason.\n\nCounselor Freemason inquired politely as to the state of his financial\nreserves. Shamar replied reassuringly.\n\n\"Good, good. That's most encouraging. Most encouraging indeed. We need\nnot place any limit on our ingenuity, then.\n\n\"I've been thinking about your case, Mr. Worker. The thing first to do,\nin my opinion, is to stir up public sympathy in your favor. It's almost\nan ideal case. It has no real political overtones. It's not as if\nyou're accused of anything serious. Well, I believe I can interest some\nfriends of mine who are always deeply concerned with cases involving\nthe infringement of an individual's liberty--provided, of course,\nthere are no political overtones. I can think of several good people\nwho would be willing to head up a Defense Committee. The fact that we\nhave and I'm talking now about as much as, oh, one hundred thousand\ndollars?\" He paused interrogatively.\n\n\"I'm prepared to pay,\" Shamar said.\n\n\"Maybe even more,\" Councilman Freemason continued quickly. \"We can come\nto that later. The important thing right now is to get down to work on\nyour case.\"\n\n\"Counselor Freemason, now, obviously I'm not a lawyer,\" Shamar said,\n\"and I know it's bad business to tell a professional how to run\nhis job. But I believe Miss Germadpoldlt explained the, ah, rather\nunusual delicacy of my own position. It would seem to me that the less\npublicity we got, the better.\"\n\nCounselor Freemason shook a pen at him. \"A very good point, Mr.\nWorker. It shows you're thinking, and I'm glad of the opportunity to\nexplain the reasons for this recommendation. If I brazenly parade you\nbefore them, you see, by implication it means we're not afraid of your\nbackground being examined. We have nothing to hide. Consequently, they\nwill not look for anything. If, on the other hand, I'm cautious,\nfearful, defensive, they'll ask themselves, 'What's Counselor Freemason\ntrying to hide?' And they'll start digging into your past.\n\n\"Now, I hope that clears that matter up to your satisfaction? Good.\nGood. I'll get right to work on your case. Do you have anything else?\nMiss Germadpoldlt explained rather nicely, I think, yesterday. As\nfar as anyone knows, you're a man without papers. You've never paid\nany taxes but they have no proof you owe taxes. You won money in the\nlottery. You collected anonymously; lots of people do for perfectly\nvalid reasons. Let them prove you didn't win. The Party can't be very\ninterested in a man like that.\n\n\"So, I'll raise an issue. Maybe we'll suggest that any lottery winner\nis likely to be persecuted. The Party wants things to go smoothly. The\nlottery makes the people feel as if, you know, they actually own a\npiece of things. And too many people don't have papers.\n\n\"My job is to take the specific and convert it to a vague general\nprinciple that a number of people feel deeply about. The Party\nwill take the easy way out: they're not dumb. They've learned from\nexperience. You're not worth that much trouble to them. Otherwise,\nthere'll be a period of aggravation, people without papers beating up\npolice and things like that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree days later, Shamar met with the newly formed Committee of One\nHundred for Justice to Shamar the Worker.\n\nThere were five members of the Committee and Counselor Freemason in\nattendance. They briefed him on their initial activities.\n\nThey had printed letterheads and were circulating letters to people\nknown to be friendly, with a hastily printed booklet giving the facts\nof the case.\n\n\"As you can see,\" Counselor Freemason said, \"we're off to a very\nfast start. Um, the question naturally arises as to finances. I have\nadvanced a certain amount out of my own pocket.... We will need\nmore than I can conveniently scrape together at the moment, and I'm\nreluctant to--ah--impose on the Committee for a loan insofar as--\"\n\n\"I took the liberty of bringing along some cash,\" Shamar said. \"For\ncurrent expenses and, of course, your retainer.\"\n\nThey looked relieved. \"Excellent, excellent. I might suggest, Mr.\nWorker, that we appoint one of the Committee as treasurer--perhaps Mrs.\nFreetle, here--\" the lady smiled--\"to take these financial worries\noff your mind. This will leave you free to devote yourself fully to\nactivities defense.\"\n\n\"Now that that's out of the way,\" one of the male Committee members\nsaid, \"let's get right down to business. As you can see, we're moving\nfast. Our overall strategy is this. We must first establish a public\nimage for you, Mr. Worker, an image the average man can identify with.\nCounselor Freemason has described your case to us. I simply don't\nknow what the Party's coming to to permit a man like Von Stutsman to\npersecute you this way. Oh, I tell you, it makes my blood boil, Mr.\nWorker!\"\n\nOthers of the Committee chimed in and the sentiment passed heatedly\namong them.\n\n\"Well,\" said Counselor Freemason, \"I guess that about winds it up for\nthe moment. You all know where to reach me. Any time, day or night. I\nguess, Mr. Worker, if you'll just turn the money over to Mrs. Freetle.\nAnd I think, Mr. Hall, if you'd hire that speech writer--what's his\nname? McGoglhy?--to work with Mr. Worker on his speeches.\"\n\n\"Speeches?\" Shamar asked.\n\n\"You're going to be our featured speaker at all the rallies, of\ncourse,\" Mrs. Freetle said. \"I know you will do splendidly, just\nsplendidly! Your accent is so captivating. I've never heard anything\nquite like it.\"\n\n\nVI\n\nOn the evening of his first public appearance, Shamar was given a\nneatly typed speech. He rehearsed it hurriedly, stammers and all.\n\n\"Fellow citizens! As I stand here, looking over this sea of faces,\nhearing your applause and seeing how your hearts go out to one poor man\nin distress, it--I--Well, I'm deeply touched. I can't tell you how much\nit means to me. I prepared a speech for tonight, but I'm not going to\nuse it. I'm just going to stand here, instead, and tell you, just as\nthe words come out, how I feel.\" Here he would pause for applause and\nthen continue. \"Thank you so very much. Thank you. I know you're all\nbehind me--except for the police agents in the audience.\" Here he would\nwait for laughter. \"We all know them, don't we? I see about a dozen.\nA dozen agents have come down here to find out what I'm going to say.\nIsn't that ridiculous?\" Here there would be mixed laughter, applause\nand cries in the affirmative. \"All right! Thank you. I hope they get an\nearful tonight.\"\n\nLater in the speech he would demand, \"Why are they doing this to me? I\nwant you to tell me why. What have I done? What am I accused of doing?\nWell, I'll tell you this--I'm not the kind of a man who is going to\nsubmit meekly to this persecution. I'm going to fight back. I've got a\nlittle money left from my lottery winnings, and I'll spend every cent\nof it to fight these people doing this thing to me.\" Here he would\npause dramatically. \"I want to leave you with this point. It's not just\nShamar the Worker that's involved. What am I? A poor, itinerant laborer\ngoing from town to town. I'm nothing, I have never had anything, and\nI guess I never will have anything. I'm no rich black marketeer or\nbusinessman. I'm no fat politician. I'm just one little man. But it's\nnot me--and this is the point I want to leave you with--it's not Shamar\nthe Worker. He's unimportant. What is important is that if they can\ndo this to me, they can do it to you. If they can do it to Shamar the\nWorker today, next year one of you will be up here on this platform\nspeaking just the way I am. So you see, this is your fight. It's not me\nthat's important--it's the principle that's important--\"\n\nThe meeting went brilliantly. Every time he paused, the audience\nresponded just as the speech-writer had indicated. It was as if they\nwere as well rehearsed as he.\n\nThe next night, another meeting. And another. And another. He slept no\nmore than four hours a night when the campaign was in full swing. He\nspoke dozens of times into the bright glare of TV cameras. He paraded\ndown a million streets in an open-topped car. Faces poured in front of\nhis own; on and on they came. People with tears in their eyes cried,\n\"God bless Shamar the Worker!\" Once the Committee hired a brass band.\n\nSo, for two weeks, it went.\n\nThen the Party threw him back in jail, in an apparent effort to deprive\nthe movement of its momentum.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter three days, during which time Shamar was held incommunicado,\nCounselor Freemason obtained permission to interview his client.\n\n\"We're making marvelous progress! Ge-Ge is turning into a most\neffective crusader. You should hear her when she cries, 'Give me back\nmy man!' This is a wonderful development for us. It's having the\nopposite of the intended effect. Von Stutsman has over-reached himself\nthis time. The Party is going to have to back down, and it will cost\nhim dearly.\"\n\n\"How's the finances?\"\n\n\"Ge-Ge has given us some advances--\"\n\n\"How much have you spent?\"\n\n\"Well, to tell you the truth, I haven't been keeping track closely.\nPerhaps we've run a little more than we anticipated. The response, you\nsee--\"\n\nShamar returned to his cell wishing Earth's printing presses had worked\na little longer.\n\nIt took nearly two weeks to arrange for Ge-Ge to visit him. When she\narrived, she was nearly on the point of tears.\n\n\"Oh, my darling, how I've missed you!\"\n\nShe brought him up to date on the progress of his case. As Counselor\nFreemason had reported, his imprisonment merely increased the vigor of\nhis supporters. Now they were at their highest pitch: a pitch which\nwould be difficult to maintain.\n\n\"I'm just worried sick,\" she said. \"If the Party can hold out another\nweek or two. I don't want to worry you, Shamar, but I want you to know\nhow you stand. Counselor Freemason says the worst that could happen\nwould be a short prison sentence, no more than a year, for not filing\ntax forms. We could keep you out on appeal for quite a while.\"\n\n\"Ge-Ge, how much have we spent so far?\"\n\n\"About three hundred thousand dollars.\"\n\n\"Good God! They'll have it all when they get through! If I ever get\nback to Earth--\"\n\n\"I don't care about money, Shamar! I just want you free!\"\n\nHe took her shoulders. \"Ge-Ge, suppose the Party can't afford to back\ndown? Maybe they feel they have to stand firm to prevent a lot of\nfuture trouble. And when Freemason gets all the money ... then what\nchance will we stand? They might railroad me for years. They'll make an\nexample out of me. Now, are you willing to gamble? Everybody would jump\nat the chance to vote them out. If we could--\"\n\n\"Please, Shamar,\" Ge-Ge said. \"All this voting thing you've always been\nso sold on is all right, I guess--but it just won't work. To begin\nwith, there isn't any way to vote.\"\n\n\"Maybe there is,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShamar was still in jail the following day when Ge-Ge appeared on the\nTV program.\n\nPAMDEN had been reluctant to release time to her. PAMDEN was Itra's\nlargest industrial co-operative--Plastics, Agricultural Machinery,\nDetergents, Electricity and Newsprint--and, being the most efficient,\nwas responsible for operating the TV networks.\n\n\"Good heavens,\" said the station executive. \"Nobody can say we haven't\nalready given you coverage. Miss Germadpoldlt.\"\n\n\"They've ordered you to stop!\" she protested.\n\n\"They? The Party? Miss Germadpoldlt, do you honestly believe that?\nNobody tells a station manager what to program. Believe me. There is no\nprior censorship whatsoever. But, on the other hand, we can't turn over\nthe TV stations to minority propaganda either.\"\n\nGe-Ge argued and pleaded, and in the end the executive sighed wearily.\n\"I think we've been more than fair. But for you--and this is a personal\nfavor, Miss Germadpoldlt, because you are a young and attractive\nwoman--for you, I will phone our program director and see if he can get\nyou on the Noon Interview Show for tomorrow. It gives you the Itra-wide\nnetwork, which is certainly more than anyone has the right to ask.\nYou'll have ninety seconds to make your case. That's the best I can do.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, thank you,\" Ge-Ge sobbed. \"You're so fair and\ngenerous.\" Outside his office she took a deep breath, crossed her\nfingers and went home to revise her speech. She had only expected sixty.\n\nGe-Ge arrived at the studio well in advance and was handed over to the\nmakeup department. With deft skill they converted her youth to age and\ncontrived to instill in her face weariness and defeat. Her protests\nwere ignored.\n\n\"This is the way you make up for TV,\" she was told.\n\nThey clucked collective tongues in disapproval when they were finished\nand sent her on her way to a brief chat with the M.C.\n\nThe M.C. assured her that she looked divine and hastily scanned her\nprepared remarks, which had been heavily edited by some anonymous hand\nin the news department. The M.C. incorporated a few pointless revisions\nand dispatched the message to the department handling idiot-board\nmaterial. It was explained that Ge-Ge was to read, word for word, from\nthe electronic prompter.\n\nGe-Ge watched the program from the wings. When she heard a commercial\nmessage in favor of the consumption of a particular variety of candy,\nher heart ran away with itself. Her courage faltered. But Shamar's face\nbrought it back.\n\nThe signal came. She walked into the terrible glare which held up every\nimperfection to microscopic inspection. She shook hands, turned, and\nthe camera closed in, full face. Beyond the camera lay the largest\ndaytime TV audience on Itra. She felt they were examining her pores\nwith minute and critical attention.\n\nShe blinked nervously and began to read. \"I am here to tell you about\nShamar the Worker.\" That was as far as she went with the prepared text.\nBefore the horrified ears of the auditors in the studio, she plunged\ninto remarks of another kind entirely.\n\n\"If you want to do something to help Shamar the Worker, stop buying\ncandy! Don't buy any more candy. If you want to help Shamar the Worker,\ndon't buy any candy until he's free. If you want to help Shamar,\nplease, _please_, don't buy--\"\n\nAt this point the technicians cut Ge-Ge out and, with profound\nmistiming, faded in an oleogenous taped message from the candy\nmanufacturer which began, \"Friends, everybody likes Red Block candy,\nand millions buy it every day. Here's why--\"\n\nGe-Ge surveyed the surrounding confusion and walked unmolested from the\nstudio.\n\nWhen she arrived home, an angry Counselor Freemason was waiting on her\ndoorstep. Inside, she allowed the Counselor to present his case.\n\nThis new move, he explained, would have terrible consequences.\nShamar's good faith would be prejudiced. One simply did not, with\nimpunity, go outside the law in such matters. There were rules you\nabsolutely _must_ play the game by. He washed his hands of all\nresponsibility for her conduct. \"I hope to God nothing comes of it,\" he\nconcluded. \"I'm having the Committee prepare a denial of--\"\n\nThe phone rang at this point, and without asking permission, Counselor\nFreemason answered it. \"Yes? This is Counselor Freemason, go ahead.\" He\nlistened a moment, said, \"They did,\" in a weary voice and cradled the\nphone.\n\nHe turned to Ge-Ge. \"Now we're in for it. That was Pete Freedle from\nthe Committee.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Ge-Ge, \"I think we'll just wait a few days and see what\nhappens.\"\n\nA week later, Ge-Ge was still waiting. Counselor Freemason, deprived of\nfinances, was powerless to move. He saw everything crashing in shambles\nat their feet.\n\n\"But are they selling candy?\" Ge-Ge asked.\n\n\"That's beside the point!\" Counselor Freemason cried. \"Look here, every\ncrackpot on the planet will get into the act. They don't care about\nShamar. All you're going to prove now is that the Party is unpopular.\nEveryone already knows that.\" He struck his forehead in exasperation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor two weeks, all was quiet. There were no more rallies for Shamar\nthe Worker. Signs were torn down and destroyed. No bulletins were\nprinted. No word passed over the electronic communications network. The\nCommittee, bankrupt, dissolved in mutual recriminations and bickering,\nconvinced that the cause of civil liberties had been set back one\nhundred years.\n\nBut candy was not selling.\n\nIt clogged the distribution channels. It piled up in warehouses. It\nlay untouched in stores. It grew rancid. Mechanically the factories\ncontinued to turn it out.\n\nThe Party denied the boycott was having any effect. This did not\nappease the distributors of candy and the sellers of candy and the\nproducers of candy. Their jobs were at stake. They had payrolls to meet.\n\nThe Party stopped production of candy. People suddenly found themselves\nwith no jobs to go to.\n\nThe economic system was so tightly controlled and organized that the\neffect was immediate. There was too little money available to purchase\nthe supplies normally purchased. Suppliers cut back on their factory\norders. This further reduced the need for supplies.\n\nAt this point, the Party decided that the people would, by heaven, eat\ncandy. The Party Leader himself went on TV to appeal to the patriotism\nof the people and to order them to resume buying candy. This was a\ntactical error. But being the idea of the Party Leader himself, who had\nalways crashed headlong into obstacles, none opposed it.\n\nThe issue was directly joined. People resented being told that it was\ntheir patriotic duty to eat something that all medical opinion held was\nharmful. Furthermore, people realized that they had somehow stumbled on\na fatal flaw in the system, which they could exploit without immediate\ndanger.\n\nThey responded by refusing to buy soap.\n\nThe people were now in open revolt. At last they had a method for\ndisapproving of things in general.\n\nThe economy plummeted. The computers were in a frenzy. Effects of\ncorrective actions were no longer predictable. The Party frantically\ntried to buy soap and dump it. The people turned to other commodities.\n\nPressure now mounted from within the Party itself. The Supervisor of\nPAMDEN saw his carefully nurtured empire begin to disintegrate. A\nmassive layoff in Consumer Plastics (badly hit by a running boycott)\ntook with it valuable key personnel. The Supervisor of PAMDEN told the\nParty Leader himself that he damned well better do something about the\nsituation, and damned soon, too.\n\nThe Party Leader himself ordered the release of Shamar the Worker.\n\nBut by then no one was interested in Shamar the Worker.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man came and unlocked Shamar's cell door. Shamar stood up. The\nguard tossed in Shamar's clothing. \"Get dressed.\" Shamar got dressed.\n\"Come along.\" Shamar came along.\n\nShamar had had no word from outside for nearly two months, and it was\nnot until he saw Ge-Ge's face, radiant with joy, that he realized he\nhad won.\n\n\"You're free!\" she cried excitedly.\n\nShamar was given back his belt and possessions. As they waited for the\nJudge to make it official, Shamar asked, \"I wonder what will happen\nnow?\"\n\n\"Nobody knows. Everybody says the Party's out for sure. Individual\nParty members will try to form a new government, but it's going to\nhave to be radically different. They'll try to keep all they can, but\nthe people will wring them dry for every last concession. Maybe now\nwhen they build the factories, they'll stay built and actually produce\nsomething.\"\n\n\"For a little while,\" Shamar said.\n\n\"Longer than a little while,\" Ge-Ge said. \"We've got a way to vote now,\nwhen things get too bad.\"\n\nThe Judge, in his red robe, came in. They stood respectfully. He looked\nat them for a long time and said nothing. Finally, he spoke:\n\n\"Well, Shamar the Worker, I guess you've got what you want. You pulled\ndown a whole civilization. I hope you're satisfied. What Dream will you\ngive us to replace the Dream you have taken from us?\"\n\nHis face hardened.\n\n\"Shamar the Worker,\" he said, \"the Party Leader himself has asked us to\ndismiss the pending charges against you. This I now do. You are free to\ngo.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Shamar said respectfully.\n\n\"Shamar the Worker, for your own sake, you better hope that I never see\nyou in my court. You better not get yourself arrested for anything. I\nwill show you no mercy, but justice will be swift and summary. So that\nyou may not rest easily at night, I am having some of my very skillful\nand competent friends check through your background thoroughly. You\nshould hope, very sincerely, that they find nothing. You may go.\"\n\nGe-Ge and Shamar stood. They turned in silence. When they were at the\ndoor, the Judge called, \"Oh, Shamar the Worker!\"\n\nHe turned, \"Yes, sir?\"\n\n\"Shamar the Worker, I do not like your accent.\"\n\nShamar could feel Ge-Ge trembling uncontrollably at his side.\n\nBut when they reached the street, they were greeted by headlines\nannouncing that a delegation from the planet Earth had arrived.\n\n\nVII\n\nThe Earth delegation had taken over a suite in the Party Hotel,\ngrandest and most expensive on Itra. Usually it was reserved for high\nParty members.\n\nShamar and Ge-Ge presented themselves at the desk. Shamar wrote out a\nnote in English. \"Deliver this to the Earthmen,\" he instructed.\n\nShamar and Ge-Ge retired to await results. Less than five minutes\npassed; the bell hop returned. \"Sir and Madam,\" he said respectfully,\n\"come with me.\"\n\nWhen he entered the suite, he felt the personality of Shamar the Worker\ndrop from him into memory.\n\n\"Captain Shaeffer! Captain Shaeffer! Oh, what a magnificent job! I'm\nGene Gibson from the new Department of Extra-Terrestrial Affairs. Who's\nthis?\"\n\n\"This is my fiancee.\"\n\n\"Good heavens, man, you intend to marry a _native_?\" The man stepped\nback, shocked.\n\nCapt. Shaeffer turned to Ge-Ge and performed bilingual introductions.\n\nThey moved from the hallway to the sitting room and arranged themselves\non the furniture.\n\n\"I must say, Captain Shaeffer, that your success on Itra has surpassed\nour wildest expectations. The first inkling we had was when, out of\nthe blue, as it were, there was your face looking out at us from the\nTV screen! You should have been there for our celebration that night!\nYou'd been on Itra just a little over two months! You're going down in\nhistory as one of the greatest heroes of all time!\"\n\nCapt. Shaeffer said, \"I think it would be best if Ge-Ge and I were to\nboard your ship immediately. Her life may be in danger. Some old-line\nParty men might resent her role in the revolution. Actually, she had\nmore to do with it than I did.\"\n\n\"Oh, now, I'm sure you must be exaggerating a bit on that, Captain\nShaeffer. Her life in danger? Surely, now! Speaking frankly,\nCaptain--and mind you, I have no personal objection at all; this is\nnone of my business. But she is, after all, an _Itraian_. You know\nthese mixed marriages--\"\n\n\"I don't give a damn what you personally think,\" Capt. Shaeffer said.\n\"Is that understood once and for all? She goes.\"\n\n\"Of course. I was just--now don't get huffy. Of course she goes. Just\nas you wish, Captain.\"\n\nThe angry exchange over an unknown but fearfully expected issue caused\nGe-Ge to blink back tears.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA week later, Gene Gibson came for the first time to visit them. Capt.\nShaeffer inquired as to progress.\n\n\"Well, Captain, things are progressing. We are establishing a\ngovernment which will be more responsive to the will of the people\nof Itra. We've had several very pleasant, informal chats with the\nParty Leader, himself. Really a wonderful man. Once he got all the\nfacts--which were kept from him the first time we landed--he strikes\nme as being quite responsible. I think we may have misjudged him. I'm\nnot too sure but what he isn't just the exact man to head up the new\ngovernment. We've discussed a few details on trade agreements and, I\nmust say, he's been very reasonable.\"\n\nCapt. Shaeffer said nothing.\n\n\"Yes,\" Gene Gibson said, \"he's really an exceptional individual.\nA wealth of administrative experience. A fine grasp of practical\npolitics. I don't regard him as a typical Itraian at all. He feels\nthat, with us backing him, we can get this whole mess straightened out\nin a few months.\"\n\n\"Mess?\"\n\n\"Well, you must admit, I think, Captain Shaeffer, that you\ndid--well--make negotiations extremely difficult, in view of the, ah,\npresent temper of the populace.\n\n\"You see, Earth would like to have a stable and responsible government.\nA government, that is, which can see larger issues in perspective.\nNot one which must devote its full time to coping with a group of\nunpatriotic anarchists running loose in the streets.\"\n\n\"What's he saying?\" Ge-Ge asked.\n\n\"As it is now,\" Gene Gibson continued, \"we do have several rather\ndifficult problems. I think we'll probably have to quarantine Itra\nfor a few months until the Party Leader himself can form a stable\norganizational structure. Somehow news of our trade discussions have\nleaked out and for some reason has resulted in a general work stoppage.\nSo you see? By God, I'll just come right out and say it: Shaeffer,\nyou've left us one hell of a mess!\"\n\nWith that, Gene Gibson departed.\n\n\"What did he say?\" Ge-Ge asked meekly. But Shaeffer only shook his head.\n\nThe following day, the ship's captain came to pay a courtesy call.\n\n\"A very neat piece of work, Merle. Your new assignment just came in, by\nthe way, on the space radio.\"\n\n\"New assignment? Ge-Ge and I are on our way back to Earth.\"\n\n\"No, you're not. We're to drop you off at Midway for transhipment to\nFolger's Hill. It's a new planet. You're to be Earth representative to\nthe people of Folger's Hill. The first shipload of colonists arrived\nabout a month ago.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Capt. Shaeffer said.\n\n\"The salary's good,\" the ship's captain said.\n\n\"Suppose I don't want to go?\"\n\n\"I've got orders to leave you at Midway. I'd want to go if I were you.\nThey want you out of the way for a little while. You can't fight it.\nYou've been appointed a General in the Defense Forces, so you're now\nunder military law--and it's an order.\"\n\nAt this point, Ge-Ge broke in to say, \"How are things going in Xxla?\"\n\nGeneral Shaeffer choked back his anger and presented the question.\n\n\"They don't tell us anything. The crew is confined to the ship.\"\n\nShamar the Worker turned to Ge-Ge. \"It's going about the same,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA year later, General Merle S. Shaeffer's card popped out of the\ncomputer.\n\n\"General Shaeffer's up for re-assignment.\"\n\n\"Who in hell is General Shaeffer?\"\n\n\"Never heard of him.\"\n\nThe card passed upward.\n\n\"Merle Shaeffer is due for re-assignment,\" a man who knew the name told\nthe Secretary of the Over Council at lunch the following day. \"There's\na new planet opened up even further away than Folger's Hill.\"\n\n\"He's the one who butchered the Itra assignment? Send him there.\nAnything new from Itra recently, by the way?\"\n\n\"Same as usual. I understand the anarchists have formed some kind of\ngovernment.\"\n\n\"Terrible. Terrible. Well, the less said about that the better.\"\n\nA week later, again over lunch, the Secretary was told:\n\n\"I guess we needn't worry about Merle Shaeffer any more. Disappeared\nfrom his post, he and that Itraian woman of his, a couple of weeks\nafter they arrived on Folger's Hill. Probably a hunting accident got\nthem both. Their bodies were never found. These things happen on wild\nnew planets.\"\n\nThe Secretary was silent for a long time. Then he said: \"Shaeffer dead,\neh? I guess it's better that way. Well, a genius has passed, and we'll\nnot see his like again. Perverted, perhaps, but a genius none the less.\"\n\nThey drank solemnly.\n\n\"To Merle Shaeffer. You could call him a hero, so let's you and I drink\nto that. No one else ever will.\"\n\nThey drank again.\n\nNothing further served to stir the Secretary's memory of Merle\nShaeffer, and he retired six months later at the end of his term. The\nnew Secretary was not familiar with the Itraian affair.\n\nHe had been in office just a few days less than a year when, one\nmorning, he arrived at his office in a furious rage. \"Get me the Head\nof the Defense Forces!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir, all the phones are tied up,\" his secretary said.\n\n\"What in hell do you mean, all the phones are tied up?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Maybe all at once everybody just left their phones off\nthe hook or something.\"\n\n\"Why would they do that? That's ridiculous! Get a runner over after\nhim.\"\n\nHalf an hour later, the Head of the Defense Forces arrived.\n\n\"Do you know,\" the new Secretary demanded, \"that yesterday all the\npennies went out of circulation? People apparently have been saving\nthem for the last couple of months. It finally showed up. All at once,\nthere aren't any pennies. You can't make change. Damn it, why would\nthose crazy idiots all decide to save their pennies at the same time?\nIt's not rational. Why did they do it?\"\n\nThe Head of the Defense Forces said nothing.\n\nThe Secretary raved at him in anger, but the Head of the Defense Forces\ndid not have the heart to tell him that a hero had returned home.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Shamar's War, by Kris Neville\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SHAMAR'S WAR ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51072.txt or 51072.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/0/7/51072/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
