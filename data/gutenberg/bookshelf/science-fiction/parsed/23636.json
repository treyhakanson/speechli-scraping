And whether you call something \"a riot\" or \"a war\" ...\n     well, there is a difference, but what is it?_\n\n\nNobody ever saw the message-torp. It wasn't to be expected. It came in\non a course that extended backward to somewhere near the Rift--where\nthere used to be Huks--and for a very, very long way it had traveled as\nonly message-torps do travel. It hopped half a light-year in overdrive,\nand came back to normality long enough for its photocells to inspect the\nstar-filled universe all about. Then it hopped another half light-year,\nand so on. For a long, long time it traveled in this jerky fashion.\n\nEventually, moving as it did in the straightest of straight lines, its\nphotocells reported that it neared a star which had achieved\nfirst-magnitude brightness. It paused a little longer than usual while\nits action-circuits shifted. Then it swung to aim for the bright star,\nwhich was the sol-type sun Varenga. The torp sped toward it on a new\nschedule. Its overdrive hops dropped to light-month length. Its pauses\nin normality were longer. They lasted almost the fiftieth of a second.\n\nWhen Varenga had reached a suitably greater brightness in the\nmessage-torp's estimation, it paused long enough to blast out its\nrecorded message. It had been designed for this purpose and no other.\nIts overdrive hops shortened to one light-hour of distance covered.\nRegularly, its transmitter flung out a repetition of what it had been\nsent so far to say. In time it arrived within the limits of the Varenga\nsystem. Its hops diminished to light-minutes of distance only. It ceased\nto correct its course. It hurtled through the orbits of all the planets,\nuttering silently screamed duplicates of the broadcasts now left behind,\nto arrive later.\n\nIt did not fall into the sun, of course. The odds were infinitely\nagainst such a happening. It pounded past the sun, shrieking its news,\nand hurtled on out to the illimitable emptiness beyond. It was still\nsquealing when it went out of human knowledge forever.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe state of things was routine. Sergeant Madden had the traffic desk\nthat morning. He would reach retirement age in two more years, and it\nwas a nagging reminder that he grew old. He didn't like it. There was\nanother matter. His son Timmy had a girl, and she was on the way to\nVarenga IV on the _Cerberus_, and when she arrived Timmy would become a\nmarried man. Sergeant Madden contemplated this prospect. By the time his\nretirement came up, in the ordinary course of events he could very well\nbe a grandfather. He was unable to imagine it. He rumbled to himself.\n\nThe telefax hummed and ejected a sheet of paper on top of other sheets\nin the desk's \"In\" cubicle. Sergeant Madden glanced absently at it. It\nwas an operations-report sheet, to be referred to if necessary, but\notherwise simply to be filed at the end of the day.\n\nA voice crackled overhead.\n\n\"_Attention Traffic_,\" said the voice. \"_The following report has been\nreceived and verified as off-planet. Message follows._\" That voice\nceased and was replaced by another, which wavered and wabbled from the\nelectron-spurts normal to solar systems and which make for auroras on\nplanets. \"_Mayday mayday mayday_,\" said the second voice. \"_Call for\nhelp. Call for help. Ship_ Cerberus _major breakdown overdrive heading\nProcyron III for refuge. Help urgently needed._\" There was a pause.\n\"_Mayday mayday mayday. Call for help--_\"\n\nSergeant Madden's face went blank. Timmy's girl was on the _Cerberus_.\nThen he growled and riffled swiftly through the operations-report sheets\nthat had come in since his tour of duty began. He found the one he\nlooked for. Yes. Patrolman Timothy Madden was now in overdrive in squad\nship 740, delivering the monthly precinct report to Headquarters. He\nwould be back in eight days. Maybe a trifle less, with his girl due to\narrive on the _Cerberus_ in nine and him to be married in ten. But--\n\nSergeant Madden swore. As a prospective bridegroom, Timmy's place was on\nthis call for help to the _Cerberus_. But he wasn't available. It was in\nhis line, because it was specifically a traffic job. The cops handled\ntraffic, naturally, as they handled sanitary-code enforcement and\ndelinks and mercantile offenses and murderers and swindlers and missing\npersons. Everything was dumped on the cops. They'd even handled the Huks\nin time gone by--which in still earlier times would have been called a\nspace war and put down in all the history books. It was routine for the\ncops to handle the disabled or partly disabled _Cerberus_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSergeant Madden pushed a button marked \"_Traffic Emergency_\" and held it\ndown until it lighted.\n\n\"You got that _Cerberus_ report?\" he demanded of the air about him.\n\n\"Just,\" said a voice overhead.\n\n\"What've you got on hand?\" demanded Sergeant Madden.\n\n\"The _Aldeb_'s here,\" said the voice. \"There's a minor overhaul going\non, but we can get her going in six hours. She's slow, but you know\nher.\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m. Yeah,\" said Sergeant Madden. He added vexedly: \"My son Timmy's\ngirl is on board the _Cerberus_. He'll be wild he wasn't here. I'm going\nto take the ready squad ship and go on out. Passengers always fret when\nthere's trouble and no cop around. Too bad Timmy's off on assignment.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said the Traffic Emergency voice. \"Too bad. But we'll get the\n_Aldeb_ off in six hours.\"\n\nSergeant Madden pushed another button. It lighted.\n\n\"Madden,\" he rumbled. \"Desk. The _Cerberus_' had a breakdown. She's\nlimpin' over to Procyron III for refuge to wait for help. The _Aldeb_'ll\ndo the job on her, but I'm going to ride the squad ship out and make up\nthe report. Who's next on call-duty?\"\n\n\"Willis,\" said a crisp voice. \"Squad ship 390. He's up for next call.\nPlaying squint-eye in the squad room now.\"\n\n\"Pull him loose,\" Sergeant Madden ordered, \"and send somebody to take\nthe desk. Tell Willis I'll be on the tarmac in five minutes.\"\n\n\"Check,\" said the crisp voice.\n\nSergeant Madden lifted his thumb. All this was standard operational\nprocedure. A man had the desk. An emergency call came in. That man took\nit and somebody else took the desk. Eminently fair. No favoritism; no\nthrowing weight around; no glory-grabbing. Not that there was much glory\nin being a cop. But as long as a man was a cop, he was good. Sergeant\nMadden reflected with satisfaction that even if he was getting on to\nretirement age, he was still a cop.\n\nHe made two more calls. One was to Records for the customary full\ninformation on the _Cerberus_ and on the Procyron system. The other was\nto the flat where Timmy lived with him. It was going to be lonely when\nTimmy got married and had a home of his own. Sergeant Madden dialed for\nmessage-recording and gruffly left word for Timmy. He, Timmy's father,\nwas going on ahead to make the report on the _Cerberus_. Timmy wasn't to\nworry. The ship might be a few days late, but Timmy'd better make the\nmost of them. He'd be married a long time!\n\nSergeant Madden got up, grunting, from his chair. Somebody came in to\ntake over the desk. Sergeant Madden nodded and waved his hand. He went\nout and took the slide-stair down to the tarmac where squad ship 390\nwaited in standard police readiness. Patrolman Willis arrived at the\nstubby little craft seconds after the sergeant.\n\n\"Procyron III,\" said Sergeant Madden, rumbling. \"I figure three days.\nYou told your wife?\"\n\n\"I called,\" said Patrolman Willis resignedly.\n\nThey climbed into the squad ship. Police ships, naturally, had their\nspecial drive, which could lift them off without rocket aid and gave\nthem plenty of speed, but filled up the hull with so much machinery that\nit was only practical for such ships. Commercial craft were satisfied\nwith low-power drives, which meant that spaceport facilities lifted them\nto space and pulled them down again. They carried rockets for emergency\nlanding, but the main thing was that they had a profitable pay load.\nSquad ships didn't carry anything but two men and their equipment.\n\nSergeant Madden dogged the door shut. The ship fell up toward the sky.\nThe heavens became that blackness-studded-with-jewels which is space. A\ngreat yellow sun flared astern. A half-bright, half-dark globe lay\nbelow-the planet Varenga IV, on which the precinct police station for\nthis part of the galaxy had its location.\n\nPatrolman Willis, frowning with care, established the squad ship's\ndirection, while Sergeant Madden observed without seeming to do so.\nPresently Patrolman Willis pushed a button. The squad ship went into\noverdrive.\n\nIt was perfectly commonplace in all its aspects.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe galaxy went about its business. Stars shone, and planets moved\naround them, and double stars circled each other like waltzing couples.\nThere were also comets and meteors and calcium-clouds and high-energy\nfree nuclei, all of which acted as was appropriate for them. On some\nmillions of planets winds blew and various organisms practiced\nphotosynthesis. Waves ran across seas. Clouds formed and poured down\nrain. On the relatively small number of worlds so far inhabited by\nhumans, people went about their business with no thought for such things\nor anything not immediately affecting their lives. And the cops went\nabout their business.\n\nSergeant Madden dozed most of the first day of overdrive travel. He had\nnothing urgent to do, as yet. This was only a routine trip. The\n_Cerberus_ had had a breakdown in her overdrive. Commercial ships'\ndrives being what they were, it meant that on her emergency drive she\ncould only limp along at maybe eight or ten lights. Which meant years to\nport, with neither food nor air for the journey. But it was not even\nconceivable to rendezvous with a rescue ship in the emptiness between\nstars. So the _Cerberus_ had sent a message-torp and was crawling to a\nrefuge-planet, more or less surveyed a hundred years before. There she\nwould land by emergency rockets, because her drive couldn't take the\nstrain. Once aground, the _Cerberus_ should wait for help. There was\nnothing else to be done. But everything was nicely in hand. The squad\nship headed briskly for the planet Procyron III, and Sergeant Madden\nwould take the data for a proper, official, emergency-call traffic\nreport on the incident, and in time the _Aldeb_ would turn up and make\nemergency repairs and see the _Cerberus_ out to space again and headed\nfor port once more.\n\nThis was absolutely all that there was to anticipate. Traffic handled\nsuch events as a matter of course. So Sergeant Madden dozed during most\nof the first day of overdrive. He reflected somnolently when awake that\nit was fitting for Timmy's father to be on the job when Timmy's girl was\nin difficulty, since Timmy was off somewhere else.\n\nOn the second day he conversed more or less with Patrolman Willis.\nWillis was a young cop, almost as young as Timmy. He took himself very\nseriously. When Sergeant Madden reached for the briefing-data, he found\nit disturbed. Willis had read up on the kind of ship the _Cerberus_ was,\nand on the characteristics of Procyron III as recorded a century before.\nThe _Cerberus_ was a semi-freighter, Candless type. Procyron III was a\nwater-planet with less than ten per cent of land. Which was unfortunate,\nbecause its average temperature and orbit made it highly suitable for\nhuman occupation. Had the ten per cent of solid ground been in one\npiece, it would doubtless have been colonized. But the ground was an\narchipelago.\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" said Sergeant Madden, after reading. \"The survey recommends\nthis northern island for emergency landing. Eh?\"\n\nWillis nodded. \"Huks used to use it. Not the island. The planet.\"\n\nSergeant Madden yawned. It seemed pathetic to him that young cops like\nWillis and even Timmy referred so often to Huks. There weren't any, any\nmore. Being a cop meant carrying out purely routine tasks, nowadays.\nThey were important tasks, of course. Without the cops, there couldn't\nbe any civilization. But Willis and Timmy didn't think of it that way.\nNot yet. To them being a cop was still a matter of glamour rather than\nroutine. They probably even regretted the absence of Huks. But when a\nman reached Sergeant Madden's age, glamour didn't matter. He had to\nremember that his job was worth doing, in itself.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Sergeant Madden. \"There was quite a time with those Huks.\"\n\n\"Did you ... did you ever see a Huk, sir?\" asked Willis.\n\n\"Before my time,\" said Sergeant Madden. \"But I've talked to men who\nworked on the case.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt did not occur to him that the Huks would hardly have been called a\n\"case\" by anybody but a cop. When human colonies spread through this\nsector, they encountered an alien civilization. By old-time standards,\nit was quite a culture. The Huks had a good technology, they had\nspaceships, and they were just beginning to expand, themselves, from\ntheir own home planet or planets. If they'd had a few more centuries of\ndevelopment, they might have been a menace to humanity. But the humans\ngot started first.\n\nThere being no longer any armies or navies when the Huks were\ndiscovered, the matter of intelligent nonhumans was a matter for the\ncops. So the police matter-of-factly tried to incorporate the Huk\nculture into the human. They explained the rules by which human\ncivilization worked. They painstakingly tried to arrange a sub-precinct\nstation on the largest Huk home planet, with Huk cops in charge. They\nmade it clear that they had nothing to do with politics and were simply\nconcerned with protecting civilized people from those in their midst who\ndidn't want to be civilized.\n\nThe Huks wouldn't have it. They bristled, proudly. They were defiant.\nThey considered themselves not only as good as humans--the cops didn't\ncare what they thought--but they insisted on acting as if they were\nbetter.\n\nThey reacted, in fact, as humans would have done if just at the\nbeginning of their conquest of the stars, they'd run into an expanding,\nfarther-advanced race which tried to tell them what they had to do. The\nHuks fought.\n\n\"They fought pretty good,\" said Sergeant Madden tolerantly. \"Not\nkiller-fashion--like delinks. The Force had to give 'em the choice of\njoining up or getting out. Took years to get 'em out. Had to use all the\noff-duty men from six precincts to handle the last riot.\"\n\nThe conflict he called a riot would have been termed a space battle by a\nnavy or an army. But the cops operated within a strictly police frame of\nreference, which was the reverse of military. They weren't trying to\nsubjugate the Huks, but to make them behave. In consequence, their\ntactics were unfathomable to the Huks--who thought in military terms.\nSquadrons of police ships which would have seemed ridiculous to a\nfighting-force commander threw the Huks off-balance, kept them\noff-balance, did a scrupulous minimum of damage to them, and thereby\nkept out of every trap the Huks set for them. In the end the cops\nsupervised and assisted at the embittered, rebellious emigration of a\nrace. The Huks took off for the far side of the galaxy. They'd neither\nbeen conquered nor exterminated. But Sergeant Madden thought of the\ndecisive fracas as a riot rather than a battle.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he repeated. \"They acted a lot like delinks.\"\n\nPatrolman Willis spoke with some heat about delinks, who are the bane of\nall police forces everywhere. They practice adolescent behavior even\nafter they grow up--but they never grow up. It is delinks who put\nstink-bombs in public places and write threatening letters and give\nwarnings of bombs about to go off--and sometimes set them--and stuff\ndirt into cold rocket-nozzles and sometimes kill people and go\nincontinently hysterical because they didn't mean to. Delinks do most of\nthe damaging things that have no sense to them. There is no cop who has\nnot wanted to kill some grinning, half-scared, half-defiant delink who\nhasn't yet realized that he's destroyed half a million credits' worth of\nproperty or crippled somebody for life--for no reason at all.\n\nSergeant Madden listened to the denunciation of all the delink tribe.\nThen he yawned again.\n\n\"I know!\" he said. \"I don't like 'em either. But we got 'em. We always\nwill have 'em. Like old age.\"\n\nThen he made computations with a stubby pencil and asked reflectively:\n\n\"When're you coming out of overdrive?\"\n\nPatrolman Willis told him. Sergeant Madden nodded.\n\n\"I'll take another nap,\" he observed. \"We'll be there a good twenty-two\nhours before the _Aldeb_.\"\n\nThe little squad ship went on at an improbable multiple of the speed of\nlight. After all, this was a perfectly normal performance. Just an\nordinary bit of business for the cops.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSergeant Madden belched when the squad ship came out of overdrive. He\nwatched with seeming indifference while Patrolman Willis took a spectro\non the star ahead and to the left, and painstakingly compared the\nreading with the ancient survey-data on the Procyron system. It had to\nmatch, of course, unless there'd been extraordinarily bad astrogation.\n\nWillis put the spectroscope away, estimated for himself, and then\nchecked with the dial that indicated the brightness of the still\npoint-sized star. He said:\n\n\"Four light-weeks, I make it.\"\n\nSergeant Madden nodded. A superior officer should never do anything\nuseful, so long as a subordinate isn't making a serious mistake. That is\nthe way subordinates are trained to become superiors, in time. Patrolman\nWillis set a time-switch and pushed the overdrive button. The squad ship\nhopped, and abruptly the local sun had a perceptible disk. Willis made\nthe usual tests for direction of rotation, to get the ecliptic plane. He\nbegan to search for planets. As he found them, he checked with the\nreference data. All this was tedious. Sergeant Madden grunted:\n\n\"That'll be it,\" he said, and pointed. \"Water world. It's the color of\nocean. Try it.\"\n\nPatrolman Willis threw on the telescope screen. The image of the distant\nplanet leaped into view. It was Procyron III. The spiral cloud-arms of a\nconsiderable storm showed in the southern hemisphere, but in the north\nthere was a group or specks which would be the planet's only solid\nground--the archipelago reported by the century-old survey. The\n_Cerberus_ should have been the first ship to land there in a hundred\nyears, and the squad ship should be the second.\n\nPatrolman Willis got the squad ship competently over to the planet, a\ndiameter out. He juggled to position over the archipelago. Sergeant\nMadden turned on the space phone. Nothing. He frowned. A grounded ship\nawaiting help should transmit a beam signal to guide its rescuer. But\nnothing came up from the ground.\n\nPatrolman Willis looked at him uncertainly. Sergeant Madden rumbled and\nswung the telescope below. The surface of the planet appeared--deep\nwater, practically black beneath a surface reflection of daytime sky.\nThe image shifted--a patch of barren rocks. The sergeant glanced at the\nsurvey picture, shifted the telescope, and found the northern-most\nisland. He swelled the picture. He could see the white of monstrous surf\nbreaking on the windward shore--waves that had gathered height going all\naround the planet. He traced the shoreline. There was a bay up at the\ntop.\n\nHe centered the shoreline of the bay and put on maximum magnification.\nThen he pointed a stubby forefinger. A singular, perfectly straight\nstreak of black appeared, beginning a little distance inland from the\nbay and running up into what appeared to be higher ground. The streak\nended not far from a serpentine arm of the sea which almost cut the\nisland in half.\n\n\"That'll be it,\" said Sergeant Madden, rumbling. \"The _Cerberus_ had to\nland on her rockets. She had some ground speed. She burned a ten-mile\nstreak on the ground, coming down.\" He growled. \"Commercial skippers!\nShould've matched velocity aloft! Take her down.\"\n\nThe squad ship drove for ground.\n\nPatrolman Willis steadied the ship no more than a few thousand feet\nhigh, above the streak of scorched ground and ashes.\n\n\"It was heading inland, all right,\" rumbled Sergeant Madden. \"Lucky! If\nit'd been heading the other way, it could've gone out and landed in the\nsea. That would ha' been a mess! But where is it?\"\n\nThe squad ship descended farther. It followed the lane of carbonized\nsoil. That marking narrowed--the _Cerberus_ had plainly been descending.\nThen the streak came to an end. It pinched out to nothing. The\n_Cerberus_ should have been at its end.\n\nIt wasn't. There was no ship down on Procyron III.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe matter ceased to be routine. If the liner's drive conked out where\nProcyron III was the nearest refuge planet, it should have landed here\nat least six days ago. Some ship had landed here recently.\n\n\"Set down,\" grunted Sergeant Madden.\n\nPatrolman Willis obeyed. The squad ship came to rest in a minor valley,\na few hundred yards from the end of the rocket-blast trail. Sergeant\nMadden got out. Patrolman Willis followed him. This was a duly surveyed\nand recommended refuge planet. There was no need to check the air or\ntake precautions against inimical animal or vegetable life. The planet\nwas safe.\n\nThey clambered over small rocky obstacles until they came to the end of\nthe scorched line. They surveyed the state of things in silence.\n\nA ship had landed here recently. Its blue-white rocket flames had melted\ngulleys in the soil, turned it to slag, and then flung silky, gossamer\nthreads of slag-wool over the rocks nearby.\n\nAt the end of the melted-away hollows, twin slag-lined holes went down\ndeep into the ground. They were take-off holes. Rockets had burned them\ndeeply as they gathered force to lift the ship away again.\n\nSergeant Madden scrambled to the edge of the nearest blast-well. He put\nhis hand on the now-solidified, glassy slag. It wasn't warm, but it\nwasn't cold. The glass-lined hole a rocket leaves takes a long time to\ncool down.\n\n\"She landed here, all right,\" he grunted. \"But she took off again before\nthe torp arrived to tell us about it.\"\n\nWillis protested:\n\n\"But, sergeant! She only had one set of rockets! She couldn't have taken\noff again! She didn't have the rockets to do it with!\"\n\n\"I know she couldn't,\" growled the sergeant. \"But she did.\"\n\nThe _Cerberus_, once landed, should have waited here. It was not only a\npolice regulation; it was common sense. When a ship broke down in space,\nthe exclusive hope for that ship's company lay in a refuge planet for\nships in that traffic lane. Even lifeboats could ordinarily reach some\nrefuge planet, for picking up later. They couldn't possibly be located\notherwise. With three dimensions in which to be missed, and light-years\nof distance in which to miss them--no ship or boat had ever been found\nas much as a light-week out in space. No ship with a crippled drive\ncould possibly be helped unless it got to a specified refuge world where\nit could be found. No ship which had reached a refuge planet could\nconceivably want to leave it.\n\nThere was also the fact that no ship which had made such a landing would\nhave extra rockets with which to take off for departure.\n\nThe _Cerberus_ had landed. Timmy's girl was on it. It had taken off\nagain. It was either an impossible mass suicide or something worse. It\ncertainly wasn't routine.\n\nPatrolman Willis asked hesitantly:\n\n\"D'you think, sergeant, it could be Huks sneaked back--?\"\n\nSergeant Madden did not answer. He went back to the squad ship and armed\nhimself. Patrolman Willis followed suit. The sergeant boobied the squad\nship so no unauthorized person could make use of it, and so it would\ndisable itself if anyone with expert knowledge tried. Therefore, nobody\nwith expert knowledge would try.\n\nThe two cops began a painstaking quest for police-type evidence to tell\nthem what had happened, and how and why the _Cerberus_ was missing,\nafter a clumsy but safe landing on Procyron III and when all sanity\ndemanded that it stay there, and when it was starkly impossible for it\nto leave.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSergeant Madden and Patrolman Willis were, self-evidently, the only\nhuman beings on a planet some nine thousand miles in diameter. It was\neasy to compute that the nearest other humans would be at least some\nthousands of thousands of millions of miles away--so far away that\ndistance had no meaning. This planet was something over nine-tenth\nrolling sea, but there were a few tens of thousands of square miles of\nsolid ground in the one archipelago that broke the ocean's surface. It\nwas such loneliness as very few people ever experience. But they did not\nnotice it. They were busy.\n\nThey went over the ground immediately about the landing place. Rocket\nflame had splashed it, both at the _Cerberus'_ landing and at the\nimpossible take-off. There was nothing within a hundred yards not burned\nto a crisp. They searched outside that area. Sergeant Madden rumbled to\nhis companion:\n\n\"Where'd the other ship land?\"\n\nPatrolman Willis blinked at him.\n\n\"There had to be another ship!\" said Sergeant Madden irritably. \"To\nbring the extra rockets. The other ship had to've brought 'em. And it\nhad to have rockets of its own. There's no spaceport here!\"\n\nPatrolman Willis blinked again. Then he saw. The _Cerberus_ carried one\nset of emergency-landing rockets, for use in a descent on a refuge\nplanet if the need arose. The need had arisen and the _Cerberus_ had\nused them. Then, from somewhere, another set of rockets had been\nproduced for it to use in leaving. Those other rockets must have come on\nanother ship. But it was a trifle more complicated than that. The\n_Cerberus_ had carried one set of rockets and used them. One. It had\nbeen supplied with another set from somewhere. Two. They must have been\nbrought by a ship which also used a set of rockets to land by. That made\nthree. Then the other ship must have had a fourth set for its own\ntake-off, or it would be grounded forever on Procyron III.\n\nPatrolman Willis frowned.\n\n\"We looked pretty carefully from aloft,\" he said uncomfortably. \"If\nthere'd been another burned-off landing place, we'd have seen it.\"\n\n\"I know,\" rumbled Sergeant Madden. \"And we didn't. But there must've\nbeen another ship aground when the _Cerberus_ came in. Where was it? It\nprob'ly knew the _Cerberus_ was landing to wait for help. How? If\nsomebody was coming to help the _Cerberus_ it would be bound to spot the\nother ship, and it didn't want to be spotted. Why? Anyhow, it must've\ntaken the _Cerberus_ and sent it off, and then taken off itself, leaving\nnothing sensible for us to think. 'Sounds like delinks.\" Then he\ngrowled. \"Only it's not. There'd have to be too many men. Delinks don't\nwork together more'n two or three. Too jealous of showin' off. But where\nwas that other ship, and what was it doin' here?\"\n\nPatrolman Willis hesitated, and then said:\n\n\"There used to be pirates, sergeant.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" said the sergeant. \"You had it right the first time, most\nlikely. Not delinks. Not pirates. You said Huks.\" He looked around,\nestimatingly. \"The rockets had to be brought here from somewhere else\nwhere they'd been landed. I'm betting the tracks were covered pretty\ncareful. But rockets are heavy. Manhandlin' them, whoever was doin' it\nwould take the easiest way. Hm-m-m. There's water close by over yonder.\nSort of a sound in there--too narrow to be a bay. Let's have a look. And\nthe slopes are easiest that way, too.\"\n\nHe led off to the eastward. He thought of Timmy's girl. He'd never seen\nher, but Timmy was going to marry her. She was on the _Cerberus_. It was\nthe job of the cops to take care of whatever dilemma that ship might be\nin. As of here and now, it was Sergeant Madden's job. But besides that,\nhe thought of the way Timmy would feel if anything happened to the girl\nhe meant to marry. As Timmy's father, the sergeant had to do something.\nHe wanted to do it fast. But it had to be done the right way.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe route he chose was rocky, but it was nearly the only practicable\nroute away from the burned-dead landing place. He climbed toward what on\nthis planet was the east. There were pinnacles and small precipices.\nThere were small, fleshy-leaved bushes growing out of such tiny\ncollections of soil as had formed in cracks and crevices in the rock.\n\nSergeant Madden noted that one such bush was wilted. He stopped. He bent\nover and carefully felt of the stones about it. A small rock came out.\nThe bush had been out of the ground before. It had carefully been\nreplaced. By someone.\n\n\"The rockets came this way,\" said the sergeant, with finality. \"Hauled\nover this pass to the _Cerberus_. Somebody must've knocked this bush\nloose while workin' at getting 'em along. So he replanted it. Only not\ngood enough. It wilted.\"\n\n\"Who did it?\" demanded Patrolman Willis.\n\n\"Who we want to know about,\" growled Sergeant Madden. \"Maybe Huks. Come\non!\"\n\nHe scrambled ahead. He wheezed as he climbed and descended. After half a\nmile, Patrolman Willis said abruptly:\n\n\"You figure they all left, before anybody tried to find 'em?\"\n\nThe sergeant grunted affirmatively. A quarter mile still farther, the\nrocky ground fell away. There was the gleam of water below them. Rocky\ncliffs enclosed an arm of the sea that came deep into the land, here. In\nthe cliffs rock-strata tilted insanely. There were red and yellow and\nblack layers--mostly yellow and black. They showed in startlingly clear\ncontrast.\n\n\"Right!\" said Sergeant Madden in morose satisfaction. \"I thought there\nmight've been a boat. But this's it!\"\n\nHe went down a steep descent to the very edge of the sound--it was even\nmore like a fjord--where the waters of the ocean came in among the\nisland's hills. On the far side, a little cascade leaped and bubbled\ndown to join the sea.\n\n\"You go that way,\" commanded Sergeant Madden, \"and I'll go this. We've\ngot two things to look for--a shallow place in the water coming right up\nto shore. And look for signs of traffic from the cliffs to the water. By\nthe color of those rocks, we'd ought to find both.\"\n\nHe lumbered away along the water's edge. There were no creatures which\nsang or chirped. The only sounds were wind and the lapping of waves\nagainst the shore. It was very, very lonely.\n\nHalf a mile from the point of his first descent, the sergeant found a\nshoal. It was a flat space of shallow water--discoverable by the color\nof the bottom. The water was not over four feet deep. It was a\nremarkably level shoal place.\n\nHe whistled on his fingers. When Patrolman Willis reached him, he\npointed to the cliffs directly across the beach from the shallow water.\nLurid yellow tints stained the cliff walls. Odd masses of fallen stone\ndotted the cliff foot. At one place they were piled high. That pile\nlooked quite natural--except that it was at the very center of the shore\nline next the shoal.\n\n\"This rock's yellow,\" said Sergeant Madden, rumbling a little. \"It's\nmineral. If we had a Geiger, it'd be raising hell, here. There's a mine\nin there. Uranium. If a ship came down on rockets, an' landed in that\nshoal place yonder ... why ... it wouldn't leave a burned spot comin'\ndown or takin' off, either. Y'see?\"\n\nPatrolman Willis said: \"Look here, sergeant--\"\n\n\"I'm in command here,\" growled Sergeant Madden. \"Huks didn't booby trap.\nProud as hell, and touchy as all get-out, but not killers. Not crazy\nkillers, anyhow. You go get up yonder. Up where we started down. Then go\non away. Back to the squad ship. If I don't come along, anyhow you'll\nknow what's what when the _Aldeb_ comes.\"\n\nPatrolman Willis expostulated. Sergeant Madden was firm. In the end,\nPatrolman Willis went away. And Sergeant Madden sat at ease and rested\nuntil he had time enough to get back to the squad ship. It was true that\nthe Huks didn't booby trap. They hadn't had the practice, anyhow, eighty\nyears ago. But this was a very important matter. Maybe they considered\nit so important that they'd changed their policy concerning this.\n\nWheezing a little, Sergeant Madden pulled away large stones and small\nones. An opening appeared behind them. He grunted and continued his\nlabor. Nothing happened. The mouth of a mine shaft appeared, going\nhorizontally into the cliff.\n\nPuffing from his exertions, Sergeant Madden went in. It was necessary if\nhe were to make a routine examination.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Aldeb_ came in a full day later. It descended, following the space\nbeacon the squad ship sent up from its resting place. The _Aldeb_ was\nnot an impressive sight, of course. It was a medium-sized police salvage\nship. It had a crew of fifteen, and it was powerfully engined, and it\ncontained a respectable amount of engineering experience and ability,\nplus some spare parts and, much more important, the tools with which to\nmake others. It came down in a highly matter-of-fact fashion, and\nSergeant Madden and Patrolman Willis went over to it to explain the\nsituation.\n\n\"The _Cerberus_ came in on rockets,\" rumbled the sergeant, in the\nsalvage ship's skipper's cabin. \"She landed. We found signs that some of\nher people came out an' strolled around lookin' for souvenirs and such.\nI make a guess that there was a minin' man among them, but it's only a\nguess. Anyhow somebody went over to where there's some parti-colored\ncliffs, where the sea comes away inland. And when they got to that\nplace ... why ... there was a ship there. Then.\"\n\nHe paused, frowning.\n\n\"It would've been standing on an artificial shoal place, about thirty\nyards from a shaft that was the mouth of a mine. Uranium. And there's\nbeen a lot of uranium taken outta there! It was hauled right outta the\nmine shaft across the beach to the ship that was waitin'. And there's\nfresh work in that mine, but not a tool or a scrap of paper to tell who\nwas workin' it. It must've been cleaned up like that every time a ship\nleft after loadin' up. Humans wouldn't've done it. They wouldn't care.\nHuks would. There's not supposed to be any of them left in these parts,\nbut I'm guessing the mine was dug by Huks, and the _Cerberus_ was taken\naway by them because the humans on the _Cerberus_ found out there was\nHuks around.\"\n\nPatrolman Willis said: \"The sergeant took a chance on the mine being\nbooby-trapped and went in, after sending me out of range.\"\n\nThe sergeant scowled at him and went on.\n\n\"How it happened don't matter. Maybe somebody spotted the ship from the\n_Cerberus_ as it was comin' down. Maybe anything. But whoever run the\nmine found out somebody knew they were there, so they rushed the\n_Cerberus_--there prob'ly wasn't even a stun-pistol on board to fight\nwith--and they put new rockets on her.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe skipper of the salvage ship _Aldeb_ nodded wisely.\n\n\"A ship comin' to load up minerals where there wasn't any spaceport,\" he\nobserved, \"would have a set of rockets to land on, empty, and a double\nset to take off on, loaded. Yeah.\"\n\n\"They must've figured,\" said Sergeant Madden, \"that we just couldn't\nmake any sense out of what we found. And if we hadn't turned up that\nmine, maybe never would. But anyhow they sent the _Cerberus_ off and\ncovered everything up and went off to stay, themselves, until we gave up\nand went home.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said the skipper of the _Aldeb_, \"where they took the\n_Cerberus_? That's my job!\"\n\n\"Not far,\" grunted Sergeant Madden. \"They had to be taking the\n_Cerberus_ somewhere. If they just wanted to wipe it out, after they\nrushed it, they coulda just set off its fuel like it'd happened in a bad\nlanding. And that landing was bad! If there'd been a fuel-explosion\ncrater at the end of that burnt line on the ground, nobody'd ever've\nlooked further. But there wasn't. So there's a place they're takin' the\n_Cerberus_ to. But it's got a brokedown drive. It can only hobble along.\nThey can't try to get but so far! What's the nearest sol-type star?\"\n\nThe _Aldeb_'s skipper pushed a button and the Precinct Atlas came out of\nits slot. The skipper punched keys and the atlas clicked and whirred.\nThen its screen lighted. It showed a report on a solar system that had\nbeen fully surveyed.\n\n\"Uh-uh,\" grunted the sergeant. \"A survey woulda showed up if a planet\nwas Huk-occupied. What's next nearest?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain the atlas whirred and clicked. A single line of type appeared. It\nsaid, \"_Sirene, 1432. Unsurveyed._\" The galactic co-ordinates followed.\nThat was all.\n\n\"This looks likely!\" said the sergeant. \"Unsurveyed, and off the ship\nlanes. It ain't between any place and any other. It could go a thousand\nyears and never be landed on. It's got planets.\"\n\nIt was highly logical. According to Krishnamurti's Law, any sol-type sun\nwas bound to have planets of such-and-such relative sizes in orbits of\nsuch-and-such relative distances.\n\n\"Willis and me,\" said the sergeant, \"we'll go over and see if there's\nHuks there and if they've got the _Cerberus_. You better get this stuff\non a message-torp ready to send off if you have to. Are you going to\ncome over to this--Sirene 1432?\"\n\nThe skipper of the _Aldeb_ shrugged.\n\n\"Might as well. Why go home and have to come back again? There could be\na lot of Huks there.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" admitted Sergeant Madden. \"I'd guess a whole planet full of 'em\nthat laid low when the rest were scrapping with the Force. The others\nlost and went clean across the galaxy. These characters stayed close.\nI'm guessing. But they hid their mine, here. They could've been stewing\nin their own juice these past eighty years, getting set to put up a hell\nof a scrap when somebody found 'em. We'll be the ones to do it.\"\n\nHe stood up and shook himself.\n\n\"It's not far,\" he repeated. \"Our boat's just fast enough we ought to\nget there a couple of days after the _Cerberus_ sets down. You'd ought\nto be five-six hours behind us.\" He considered. \"Meet you north pole\nfarthest planet out this side of the sun. Right?\"\n\n\"I'll look for you there,\" said the skipper of the _Aldeb_.\n\nSergeant Madden and Patrolman Willis went out of the salvage ship and\ntrudged to the squad ship. They climbed in.\n\n\"You got the co-ordinates?\" asked the sergeant.\n\n\"I copied them off the atlas,\" said Willis.\n\nSergeant Madden settled himself comfortably.\n\n\"We'll go over,\" he grumbled, \"and see what makes these Huks tick. They\nraised a lot of hell, eighty years ago. It took all the off-duty men\nfrom six precincts to handle the last riot. The Huks had got together\nand built themselves a fightin' fleet then, though. It's not likely\nthere's more than one planetful of them where we're going. I thought\nthey'd all been moved out.\"\n\nHe shook his head vexedly.\n\n\"No need for 'em to have to go, except they wouldn't play along with\nhumans. Acted like delinks, they did. Only proud. Y'don't get mad\nfighting 'em. So I heard, anyway. If they only had sense you could get\nalong with them.\"\n\nHe dogged the door shut. Patrolman Willis pushed a button. The squad\nship fell toward the sky.\n\nVery matter-of-factly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the way over, in overdrive, Sergeant Madden again dozed a great deal\nof the time. Sergeants do not fraternize extensively with mere\npatrolmen, even on assignments. Especially not very senior sergeants\nonly two years from retirement. Patrolman Willis met with the sergeant's\napproval, to be sure. Timmy was undoubtedly more competent as a cop, but\nTimmy would have been in a highly emotional state with his girl on the\n_Cerberus_ and that ship in the hands of the Huks.\n\nBetween naps, the sergeant somnolently went over what he knew about the\nalien race. He'd heard that their thumbs were on the outside of their\nhands. Intelligent nonhumans would have to have hands, and with some\nequivalent of opposable thumbs, if their intelligence was to be of any\nuse to them. They pretty well had to be bipeds, too, and if they weren't\nwarm-blooded they couldn't have the oxygen-supply that highgrade brain\ncells require.\n\nThere were even certain necessary psychological facts. They had to be\ncapable of learning and of passing on what they'd learned, or they'd\nnever have gotten past an instinctual social system. To pass on acquired\nknowledge, they had to have family units in which teaching was done to\nthe young--at least at the beginning. Schools might have been invented\nlater. Most of all, their minds had to work logically to cope with a\nlogically constructed universe. In fact, they had to be very much like\nhumans, in almost all significant respects, in order to build up a\ncivilization and develop sciences and splendidly to invade space just a\nfew centuries before humans found them.\n\n_But_, said Sergeant Madden to himself, _I bet they've still got armies\nand navies!_\n\nPatrolman Willis looked at him inquiringly, but the sergeant scowled at\nhis own thoughts. Yet the idea was very likely. When Huks first\nencountered humans, they bristled with suspicion. They were definitely\non the defensive when they learned that humans had been in space\nlonger--much longer--than they had, and already occupied planets in\nalmost fifteen per cent of the galaxy.\n\nSergeant Madden found his mind obscurely switching to the matter of\ndelinks--those characters who act like adolescents, not only while they\nare kids, but after. They were the permanent major annoyance of the\ncops, because what they did didn't make sense. Learned books explained\nwhy people went delink, of course. Mostly it was that they were madly\nambitious to be significant, to matter in some fashion, and didn't have\nthe ability to matter in the only ways they could understand. They\nwanted to drive themselves to eminence, and frantically snatched at\nchances to make themselves nuisances because they couldn't wait to be\nimportant any other way.\n\nSergeant Madden blinked slowly to himself. When humans first took to\nspace a lot of them were after glamour, which is the seeming of\nimportance. His son Timmy was on the cops because he thought it\nglamorous. Patrolman Willis was probably the same way. Glamour is the\noffer of importance. An offer of importance is glamour.\n\nThe sergeant grunted to himself. A possible course of action came into\nhis mind. He and Patrolman Willis were on the way to the solar system\nSirene 1432, where Krishnamurti's Law said there ought to be something\nvery close to a terran-type planet in either the third or fourth orbit\nout from the sun. That planet would be inhabited by Huks, who were very\nmuch like humans. They knew of the defeat and forced emigration of their\nfellow-Huks in other solar systems. They'd hidden from humans--and it\nmust have outraged their pride. So they must be ready to put up a\ndesperate and fanatical fight if they were ever discovered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA squad ship with two cops in it, and a dumpy salvage ship with fifteen\nmore, did not make an impressive force to try to deal with a planetary\npopulation which bitterly hated humans. But the cops did not plan\nconquest. They were neither a fighting rescue expedition nor a punitive\none. They were simply cops on assignment to get the semi-freighter\n_Cerberus_ back in shape to travel on her lawful occasions among the\nstars, and to see that she and her passengers and crew got to the\ndestination for which they'd started. The cop's purpose was essentially\nroutine. And the Huks couldn't possibly imagine it.\n\nSergeant Madden settled some things in his mind and dozed off again.\n\nWhen the squad ship came out of overdrive and he was awakened by the\nunpleasantness of breakout, he yawned. He looked on without comment as\nPatrolman Willis matter-of-factly performed the tricky task of\ndetermining the ecliptic while a solar system's sun was little more than\na first-magnitude star. It was wholly improbable that anything like Huk\npatrol ships would be out so far. It was even more improbable that any\nkind of detection devices would be in operation. Any approaching ship\ncould travel several times as fast as any signal.\n\nPatrolman Willis searched painstakingly. He found a planet which was a\nmere frozen lump of matter in vastness. It was white from a layer of\nfrozen gases piled upon its more solid core. He made observations.\n\n\"I can find it again, sir, to meet the _Aldeb_. Orders, sir?\"\n\n\"Orders?\" demanded Sergeant Madden. \"What? Oh. Head in toward the sun.\nThe Huks'll be on Planet Three or Four, most likely. And that's where\nthey'll have the _Cerberus_.\"\n\nThe squad ship continued sunward while Patrolman Willis continued his\nobservations. A star-picture along the ecliptic. An hour's run on\ninterplanetary drive--no overdrive field in use. Another picture. The\ntwo prints had only to be compared with a blinker for planets to stick\nout like sore thumbs, as contrasted with stars that showed no parallax.\nSirene I--the innermost planet--was plainly close to a transit. II was\naway on the far side of its orbit. III was also on the far side. IV was\nin quadrature. There was the usual gap where V should have been. VI--it\ndidn't matter. They'd passed VIII a little while since, a ball of stone\nwith a frigid gas-ice covering.\n\nPatrolman Willis worked painstakingly with amplifiers on what oddments\ncould be picked up in space.\n\n\"It's Four, sir,\" he reported unnecessarily, because the sergeant had\nwatched as he worked. \"They've got detectors out. I could just barely\npick up the pulses. But by the time they've been reflected back they'll\nbe away below thermal noise-volume. I don't think even multiples could\npick 'em out. I'm saying, sir, that I don't think they can detect us at\nthis distance.\"\n\nSergeant Madden grunted.\n\n\"D'you think we came this far not to be noticed?\" he asked. But he was\nnot peevish. Rather, he seemed more thoroughly awake than he'd been\nsince the squad ship left the Precinct substation back on Varenga IV. He\nrubbed his hands a little and stood up. \"Hold it a minute, Willis.\"\n\nHe went back to the auxiliary-equipment locker. He returned to his seat\nbeside Patrolman Willis. He opened the breech of the ejector-tube beside\nhis chair.\n\n\"You've had street-fighting training,\" he said almost affably, \"at the\nPolice Academy. And siege-of-criminals courses too, eh?\" He did not wait\nfor an answer. \"It's historic,\" he observed, \"that since time began\ncops've been stickin' out hats for crooks to shoot at, and that\ncrooks've been shooting, thinking there were heads in 'em.\"\n\nHe put a small object in the ejector tube, poked it to proper seating,\nand settled himself comfortably, again.\n\n\"Can you make it to about a quarter-million miles of Four,\" he asked\ncheerfully, \"in one hop?\"\n\nPatrolman Willis set up the hop-timer. Sergeant Madden was pleased that\nhe aimed the squad ship not exactly at the minute disk which was Planet\nIV of this system. It was prudence against the possibility of an error\nin the reading of distance.\n\n\"Ever use a marker, Willis?\"\n\nPatrolman Willis said: \"No, sir.\"\n\nBefore he'd finished saying it the squad ship had hopped into overdrive\nand out again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSergeant Madden approved of the job. His son Timmy couldn't have done\nbetter. Here was Planet IV before them, a little off to one side, as was\nproper. They had run no risk of hitting in overdrive.\n\nThe distance was just about a quarter-million miles, if Krishnamurti's\nLaw predicting the size and distance of planets in a sol-type system was\nreliable. The world was green and had icecaps. There should always be,\nin a system of this kind, at least one oxygen-planet with a\nnearly-terran-normal range of temperature. That usually meant green\nplants and an ocean or two. There wasn't quite as much sea as usual, on\nthis planet, and therefore there were some extensive yellow areas that\nmust be desert. But it was a good, habitable world. Anybody whose home\nit was would defend it fiercely.\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" said Sergeant Madden. He took the ejector-tube lanyard in his\nhand. He computed mentally. About a quarter-million miles, say. A second\nand a half to alarm, down below. Five seconds more to verification.\nAnother five to believe it. Not less than twenty altogether to report\nand get authority to fire. The Huks were a fighting race and presumably\norganized, so they'd have a chain of command and decisions would be made\nat the top. Army stuff, or navy. Not like the cops, where everybody knew\nboth the immediate and final purposes of any operation in progress, and\ncould act without waiting for orders.\n\nIt should be not less than thirty seconds before a firing key made\ncontact down below. As a matter of history, years ago the Huks had used\neighty-gravity rockets with tracking-heads and bust-bombs on them. These\nHuks would hardly be behind the others in equipment. And back then, too,\nHuks kept their rocket missiles out in orbit where they could flare into\neighty-gee acceleration without wasting time getting out to where an\nenemy was. In their struggle against the cops two generations ago the\nHuks had had to learn that fighting wasn't all drama and heroics. The\ncops had taken the glamour out when they won. So the Huks wouldn't waste\ntime making fine gestures now. The squad ship had appeared off their\nplanet. It had not transmitted a code identification-signal the instant\nit came out of overdrive. The Huks were hiding from the cops, so they'd\nshoot.\n\n\"Hop on past,\" commanded Sergeant Madden, \"the instant I jerk the\nejector lanyard. Don't fool around. Over the pole will do.\"\n\nPatrolman Willis set the hop-timer. Twenty seconds. Twenty-two. Three.\nFour.\n\n\"Hop!\" said Sergeant Madden. As he spoke, he jerked the lanyard.\n\nBefore the syllable was finished, Patrolman Willis pressed hard on the\noverdrive button. There came the always-nauseating sensation of going\ninto overdrive combined with the even more unpleasant sensation of\ncoming out of it. The squad ship was somewhere else.\n\nA vast, curving whiteness hung catercornered in the sky. It was the\nplanet's icecap, upside down. Patrolman Willis had possibly cut it a\ntrifle too fine.\n\n\"Right,\" said the sergeant comfortably. \"Now swing about to go back and\nmeet the _Aldeb_. But wait.\"\n\nThe stars and the monstrous white bowl reeled in their positions as the\nship turned. Sergeant Madden felt that he could spare seconds, here. He\nignored the polar regions of Sirene IV, hanging upside down to rearward\nfrom the squad ship. Even a planetary alarm wouldn't get polar-area\nobservers set to fire in much less than forty seconds, and there'd have\nto be some lag in response to instrument reports. It wouldn't be as if\ntrouble had been anticipated at just this time.\n\nThe squad ship steadied. Sergeant Madden looked with pleasurable\nanticipation back to where the ship had come out of overdrive and\nlingered for twenty-four seconds. Willis had moved the squad ship from\nthat position, but the sergeant had left a substitute. The small object\nhe'd dropped from the ejector tube now swelled and writhed and\nstruggled. In pure emptiness, a shape of metal foil inflated itself. It\nwas surprisingly large--almost the size of the squad ship. But in\nemptiness the fraction of a cubic inch of normal-pressure gas would\ninflate a foil bag against no resistance at all. This flimsy shape even\njerked into motion. Released gas poured out its back. There was no\nresistance to acceleration save mass, which was negligible.\n\nA sudden swirling cloud of vapor appeared where the squad ship's\nsubstitute went mindlessly on its way. The vapor rushed toward the\nspace-marker.\n\nA star appeared. It was a strictly temporary star, but even from a\nquarter-million-mile distance it was incredibly bright. It was a bomb,\nblasting a metal-foil flimsy which the electronic brain of a\nmissile-rocket could only perceive as an unidentified and hence enemy\nobject. Bomb and rocket and flimsy metal foil turned together to\nradioactive metal vapor.\n\nSergeant Madden knew professional admiration.\n\n\"Thirty-four seconds!\" he said approvingly.\n\nThe Huks could not have expected the appearance of an enemy just here\nand now. It was the first such appearance in all the planet's history.\nThey certainly looked for no consequences of the seizure of the\n_Cerberus_, carefully managed as that had been. So to detonate a bomb\nagainst an unexpected inimical object within thirty-four seconds after\nits appearance was very good work indeed.\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" said Sergeant Madden, \"we've nothing more to do right now,\nWillis. We'll go back to that hunk of ice you spotted comin' in, and\nwait for the _Aldeb_.\"\n\nPatrolman Willis obediently set the hop-timer and swung the squad ship\nto a proper aiming. He pressed the overdrive button.\n\nHis manner, like that of Sergeant Madden, was the manner of someone\nconducting a perfectly routine operation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"If my son Timmy were with me on this job,\" said Sergeant Madden, \"I'd\npoint out the inner meaning of the way we're going about handling it.\"\n\nHe reposed in his bucket-seat in the squad ship, which at that moment\nlay aground not quite right-side-up close to the north pole of Sirene\nVIII. The local sun was not in view. The squad ship's ports opened upon\nthe incredible brilliance of the galaxy as seen out of atmosphere. There\nwas no atmosphere here. It was all frozen. But there was a horizon, and\nthe light of the stars showed the miniature jungle of gas crystals.\nFrozen gases--frozen to gas-ice--they were feathery. They were lacy.\nThey were infinitely delicate. They were frost in three dimensions.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Patrolman Willis.\n\n\"The _Aldeb_'s due soon,\" said Sergeant Madden, \"so I'll make it short.\nThe whole thing is that we are cops, and the Huks are soldiers. Which\nmeans that they're after feeling important--after glamour. Every one of\n'em figures it's necessary to be important. He craves it.\"\n\nPatrolman Willis listened. He had a proximity detector out, which would\npick up any radiation caused by the cutting of magnetic lines of force\nby any object. It made very tiny whining noises from time to time. If\nanything from a Huk missile rocket to the salvage ship _Aldeb_\napproached, however, the sound would be distinctive.\n\n\"Now that,\" said Sergeant Madden, \"is the same thing that makes delinks.\nA delink tries to matter in the world he lives in. It's a small world,\nwith only him and his close pals in it. So he struts before his pals. He\ndon't realize that anybody but him and his pals are human. See?\"\n\n\"I know!\" said Patrolman Willis with an edge to his voice. \"Last month a\ncouple of delinks set a ground-truck running downhill, and jumped off\nit, and--\"\n\n\"True,\" said Sergeant Madden. He rumbled for a moment. \"A soldier lives\nin a bigger world he tries to matter in. He's protectin' that world and\nbeing admired for it. In old, old days his world was maybe a day's march\nacross. Later it got to be continents. They tried to make it planets,\nbut it didn't work. But there've got to be enemies to protect a world\nagainst, or a soldier isn't important. He's got no glamour. Y'see?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Willis.\n\n\"Then there's us cops,\" said Sergeant Madden wryly. \"Mostly we join up\nfor the glamour. We think it's important to be a cop. But presently we\nfind we ain't admired. Then there's no more glamour--but we're still\nimportant. A cop matters because he protects people against other people\nthat want to do things to 'em. Against characters that want to get\nimportant by hurtin' 'em. Being a cop means you matter against all the\ndelinks and crooks an' fools and murderers who'd pull down civilization\nin a minute if they could, just so they could be important because they\ndid it. But there's no glamour! We're not admired! We just do our job.\nAnd if I sound sentimental, I mean it.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Willis.\n\n\"There's a big picture in the big hall in Police Headquarters on Valdez\nIII,\" said the sergeant. \"It's the story of the cops from the early days\nwhen they wore helmets, and the days when they rode bicycles, and when\nthey drove ground-cars. There's not only cops, but civilians, in every\none of the panels, Willis. And if you look careful, you'll see that\nthere's one civilian in every panel that's thumbin' his nose at a cop.\"\n\n\"I've noticed,\" said Willis.\n\n\"Remember it,\" said Sergeant Madden. \"It bears on what we've got to do\nto handle these Huks. Soldiers couldn't do what we've got to. They'd\nfight, to be admired. We can't. It'd spoil our job. We've got to\npersuade 'em to behave themselves.\"\n\nThen he frowned, as if he were dissatisfied with what he'd said. He\nshook his head and made an impatient gesture.\n\n\"No good,\" he said vexedly. \"You can't say it. Hm-m-m ... I'll nap a\nwhile until the _Aldeb_ gets here.\"\n\nHe settled back to doze.\n\nPatrolman Willis regarded him with an odd expression. They were aground\non Sirene VIII, on which no human ship had ever landed before them, and\nthey had stirred up a hornet's nest on Sirene IV, which had orbital\neighty-gee rocket missiles in orbit around it with bust bomb heads and\nall the other advantages of civilization. The _Aldeb_ was on the way\nwith a fifteen-man crew. And seventeen men, altogether, must pit\nthemselves against an embattled planet with all its population ready and\nperhaps eager for war. Their errand was to secure the release of human\nprisoners and the surrender of a seized spaceship from a proud and\ndesperate race.\n\nIt did not look promising. Sergeant Madden did not look like the kind of\ngenius who could carry it through. Dozing, with his chin tilted forward\non his chest, he looked hopelessly commonplace.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe skipper of the _Aldeb_ came over to the squad ship, because Sergeant\nMadden loathed spacesuits and there was no air on Sirene VIII. Patrolman\nWillis watched as the skipper came wading through the lacy, breast-high\ngas-frost. It seemed a pity for such infinitely delicate and beautiful\nobjects to be broken and crushed.\n\nThe sergeant unlocked the lock-door and spoke into a microphone when he\nheard the skipper stamping on the steel lock-flooring.\n\n\"Brush yourself off,\" commanded the sergeant, \"and sweep the stuff\noutside. Part of its methane and there's some ammonia in those\ncrystals.\"\n\nThere was a suitable pause. The outer door closed. The lock filled with\nair, and gas-crystal fragments turned to reeking vapor as they warmed.\nThe skipper bled them out and refilled the lock. Then he came inside. He\nopened his face plate.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"There's Huks here,\" Sergeant Madden told him, \"their hair in a braid\nand all set to go. They popped off a marker I stuck out for them to\nshoot at in thirty-four seconds by the clock. Bright boys, these Huks!\nThey don't wait to ask questions. When they see something, they shoot at\nit.\"\n\nThe skipper tilted back his helmet and said beseechingly:\n\n\"Scratch my head, will you?\"\n\nWhen Patrolman Willis reached out his hand, the skipper revolved his\nhead under it until the itchy place was scratched. Most men itch\ninstantly they are unable to scratch. The skipper's space gloves were\nsprouting whiskers of moisture-frost now.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said gratefully. \"What are you going to do, sergeant?\"\n\n\"Open communication with 'em,\" said the sergeant, heavily.\n\nThe skipper waited. Opening communication with someone who shoots on\ndetector-contact may be difficult.\n\n\"I figure,\" rumbled the sergeant, \"they're a lot like delinks. A cop can\nfigure how they think, but they can't figure how a cop thinks.\"\n\n\"Such as?\" asked the skipper.\n\n\"They can't understand anybody not tryin' to be important,\" said\nSergeant Madden. \"It baffles 'em.\"\n\n\"What's that got to do with the people on the _Cerberus_?\" demanded the\nskipper. \"It's our job to get them and the _Cerberus_ back on the way to\nport!\"\n\n\"I know!\" conceded Sergeant Madden, \"and the girl my son Timmy's going\nto marry is one of them. But I don't think we'll have much trouble. Have\nyou got any multipoly plastic on the _Aldeb_?\"\n\nThe skipper nodded, blankly. Multipoly plastic is a substance as\nanomalous as its name. It is a multiple polymer of something-or-other\nwhich stretches very accommodatingly to a surprising expanse, and then\nsuddenly stops stretching. When it stops, it has a high and obstinate\ntensile strength. All ships carry it for temporary repairs, because it\nwill seal off anything. A one-mill thickness will hold fifteen pounds\npressure. Ships have been known to come down for landing with bubbles of\nmultipoly glistening out of holes in their hulls. A salvage ship,\nespecially, would carry an ample supply. A minor convenience in its use\nis the fact that a detonator-cap set off at any part of it starts a wave\nof disintegration which is too slow to be an explosion and cleans up the\nmess made in its application.\n\n\"Naturally I've got it,\" said the skipper. \"What do you want with it?\"\n\nSergeant Madden told him. Painfully. Painstakingly.\n\n\"The tough part,\" said the skipper, \"is making 'em go out an ejector\ntube. But I've got fourteen good men. Give me two hours for the first\nbatch. We'll make up the second while you're placing them.\"\n\nSergeant Madden nodded.\n\nThe skipper went into the lock and closed the door behind him. After a\nmoment Patrolman Willis saw him wading through the incredibly delicate\nand fragile gas-ice crystals. Then the _Aldeb_'s lock swallowed him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe odd thing about the Huk business was the minute scale of the things\nthat happened, compared to the background in which they took place. The\nsquad ship, for example, lifted off Sirene VIII for the second time.\nShe'd been out once and come back for the second batch of multipoly\nobjects. Sirene VIII was not a giant planet, by any means, but it was a\nrespectable six thousand miles in diameter. The squad ship's sixty feet\nof length was a mote so minute by comparison that no comparison was\npossible.\n\nShe headed in toward the sun. She winked out of existence into\noverdrive. She headed toward Sirene IV, in quadrature, where missile\nrockets floated in orbit awaiting the coming of any enemy. The distance\nto be traveled was roughly one and a half light-hours--some twelve\nastronomical units of ninety-three million miles each.\n\nThe squad ship covered that distance in a negligible length of time. It\npopped into normality about two hundred thousand miles out from the Huk\nhome-world. It seemed insolently to remain there. In a matter of seconds\nit appeared at another place--a hundred fifty thousand miles out, but\noff to one side. It seemed arrogantly to remain there, too--in a second\nplace at the same time. Then it appeared, with the arbitrary effect a\nship does give when coming out of overdrive, at a third place a hundred\nseventy-five thousand miles from the planet. At a fourth place barely\neighty thousand miles short of collision with the Huk world. At a fifth\nplace. A sixth. Each time it appeared, it seemed to remain in plain,\nchallenging, insolent view, without ceasing to exist at the spots where\nit had appeared previously. In much less than a minute, the seeming of a\nsizable squadron of small human ships had popped out of emptiness and\nlay off the Huk home world at distances ranging from eighty thousand\nmiles to three times as much.\n\nSuddenly, light flashed intolerably in emptiness. It was in contact with\none of the seeming squad ships, which ceased to be. But immediately two\nmore ships appeared at widely different spots. A second flash--giant and\nterrible nearby--a pin point of light among the stars. Another\nostensible human ship vanished in atomic flame--but still another\nappeared magically from nowhere. A third and then a fourth flash. Three\nmore within successive seconds.\n\nSquad ships continued to appear as if by necromancy, and space near the\nplanet was streaked by flarings of white vapor as eighty-gee rockets\nhurled themselves to destruction against the invading objects. As each\nbomb went off, its light was brighter than the sun. But each was a mere\nflicker in enormousness. They flashed, and flashed--Each was a bomb\nturning forty kilograms of matter into pure, raw, raging destruction.\nEach was devastation sufficient to destroy the greatest city the galaxy\never knew.\n\nBut in that appalling emptiness they were mere scintillations. In the\nbackground of a solar system's vastness they made all the doings of men\nand Huks alike seem ludicrous.\n\nFor a long time--perhaps five minutes, perhaps ten--the flashings which\nwere the most terrible of all weapons continued. Each flash destroyed\nsomething which, in scale, was less than a dust mote. But more motes\nappeared, and more and more and more.\n\nAnd presently the flashes grew infrequent. The threads of vapor which\nled to each grew longer. In a little while they came from halfway around\nthe planet. Then squad ships appeared even there. And immediately pin\npoints of intolerable brilliance destroyed them--yet never as fast as\nthey appeared.\n\nFinally there came ten seconds in which no atomic flame ravened in\nemptiness. One more glitter. Fifteen seconds. Twenty. Thirty seconds\nwithout a flashing of atomic explosive--\n\nThe surviving objects which appeared to be squad ships hung in space.\nThey moved without plan. They swam through space without destination.\nPresently the most unobservant of watches must have perceived that their\nmovement was random. That they were not driven. That they had no\npurpose. That they were not squad ships but targets--and not even robot\ntargets--set out for the missile rockets of the Huk planet to expend\nthemselves on.\n\nThe missile rockets had expended themselves.\n\nSo Sergeant Madden opened communication with the Huks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"These Huks,\" observed Sergeant Madden as the squad ship descended to\nthe Huk planet's surface, \"they must've had a share in the scrapping\neighty years ago. They've got everything the old-time Huks had. They've\neven got recordings of human talk from civilian human prisoners of years\ngone by. And they kept somebody able to talk it--for when they fought\nwith us!\"\n\nPatrolman Willis did not answer. He had a strange expression on his\nface. At the moment they were already within the Huk home-planet's\natmosphere. From time to time a heavily accented voice gave curt\ninstructions. It was a Huk voice, telling Patrolman Willis how to guide\nthe squad ship to ground where--under truce--Sergeant Madden might hold\nconference with Huk authorities.\n\n\"_Hold the course_,\" said the voice. \"_That is r-right. Do as you are._\"\n\nThe horizon had ceased to be curved minutes ago. Now the ground rose\ngradually. The ground was green. Large green growths clustered off to\none side of the flat area where the ship was to alight. They were the\nequivalent of trees on this planet. Undoubtedly there were equivalents\nof grass and shrubs, and seed-bearing and root-propagating vegetation,\nand Huks would make use of some seeds and roots for food. Because in\norder to have a civilization one has to have a larger food-supply than\ncan be provided by even the thriftiest of grazing animals. But the Huks\nor their ancestors would need to have been flesh-eaters also, for brains\nto be useful in hunting and therefore for mental activity to be\nrecognized as useful. A vegetarian community can maintain a\ncivilization, but it has to start off on meat.\n\nA clump of ground-cars waited for the squad ship's landing. The ship\ntouched, delicately. Sergeant Madden rumbled and got out of his chair.\nPatrolman Willis looked at him uneasily.\n\n\"Huh!\" said Sergeant Madden. \"Of course you can come. You want them to\nthink we're bluffing? No. Nothing to fight with. The Huks think our\nfleet's set to do the fighting.\"\n\nHe undogged the exit door and went out through the small vestibule which\nwas also the ship's air lock. Patrolman Willis joined him out-of-doors.\nThe air was fresh. The sky was blue. Clouds floated in the sky, and\ngrowing things gave off a not-unpleasant odor, and a breeze blew\nuncertainly. But such things happen on appropriate planets in most\nsol-type solar systems.\n\nHuks came toward them. Stiffly. Defiantly. The most conspicuous\ndifference between Huks and humans was of degree. Huks grew hair all\nover their heads, instead of only parts of it. But they wore garments,\nand some of the garments were identical and impressive, so they could be\nguessed to be uniforms.\n\n\"How-do,\" said the voice that had guided the ship down. \"We are r-ready\nto listen to your message.\"\n\nSergeant Madden said heavily:\n\n\"We humans believe you Huks have got a good fleet. We believe you've got\na good army. We know you've got good rockets and a fighting force that's\nworth a lot to us. We want to make a treaty for you to take over and\ndefend as much territory as you're able to, against some characters\nheading this way from the Coalsack region.\"\n\nSilence. The interpreter translated, and the Huks muttered astonishedly\namong themselves. The interpreter received instructions.\n\n\"Do you mean others of our r-race?\" he demanded haughtily. \"Members of\nour own r-race who r-return to r-recover their home worlds from humans?\"\n\n\"Hell, no!\" said Sergeant Madden dourly. \"If you can get in contact with\nthem and bring them back, they can have their former planets back and\nmore besides--if they'll defend 'em. We're stretched thin. We didn't\ncome here to fight your fleet. We came to ask it to join us.\"\n\nMore mutterings. The interpreter faced about.\n\n\"This surpr-rises us,\" he said darkly. \"We know of no danger in the\ndirection you speak of. Per-rhaps we would wish to make fr-riends with\nthat danger instead of you!\"\n\nSergeant Madden snorted.\n\n\"You're welcome!\" Then he said sardonically: \"If you're able to reach us\nafter you try, the offer stands. Join us, and you'll give your own\ncommands and make your own decisions. We'll co-operate with you. But you\nwon't make friends with the characters I'm talking about! Not hardly!\"\n\nMore hurried discussions still. The interpreter, defiantly: \"And if we\nr-refuse to join you?\"\n\nSergeant Madden shrugged.\n\n\"Nothing. You'll fight on your own, anyhow. So will we. If we joined up\nwe could both fight better. I came to try to arrange so we'd both be\nstronger. We need you. You need us.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a pause. Patrolman Willis swallowed. At five-million-mile\nintervals, in a circle fifty million miles across with the Huk world as\nits center, objects floated in space. Patrolman Willis knew about them,\nbecause he and Sergeant Madden had put them there immediately after the\nmissile rockets ceased to explode. He knew what they were, and his spine\ncrawled at the thought of what would happen if the Huks found out. But\nthe distant objects were at the limit of certain range for detection\ndevices. The planet's instruments could just barely pick them up. They\nsubtended so small a fraction of a thousandth of a second of arc that no\ninformation could be had about them.\n\nBut they acted like a monstrous space fleet, ready to pour down\nwar-headed missiles in such numbers as to smother the planet in atomic\nflame. Patrolman Willis could not imagine admitting that such a supposed\nfleet needed another fleet to help it. A military man, bluffing as\nSergeant Madden bluffed, would not have dared offer any terms less\nonerous than abject surrender. But Sergeant Madden was a cop. It was not\nhis purpose to make anybody surrender. His job was, ultimately, to make\nthem behave.\n\nThe Huks conferred. The conference was lengthy. The interpreter turned\nto Sergeant Madden and spoke with vast dignity and caginess:\n\n\"When do you r-require an answer?\"\n\n\"We don't,\" grunted Sergeant Madden. \"When you make up your minds, send\na ship to Varenga III. We'll give you the information we've got. That's\nwhether you fight with us or independent. You'll fight, once you meet\nthese characters! We don't worry about that! Just ... we can do better\ntogether.\" Then he said: \"Have you got the co-ordinates for Varenga? I\ndon't know what you call it in your language.\"\n\n\"We have them,\" said the interpreter, still suspiciously.\n\n\"Right!\" said Sergeant Madden. \"That's all. We came here to tell you\nthis. Let us know when you make up your minds. Now we'll go back.\"\n\nHe turned as if to trudge back to the squad ship. And this, of course,\nwas the moment when the difference between a military and a cop mind was\ngreatest. A military man, with the defenses of the planet smashed--or\nexhausted--and an apparent overwhelming force behind him, would have\ntried to get the _Cerberus_ and its company turned over to him either by\nimplied or explicit threats. Sergeant Madden did not mention them. But\nhe had made it necessary for the Huks to do something.\n\nThey'd been shocked to numbness by the discovery that humans knew of\ntheir presence on Sirene IV. They'd been made aghast by the brisk and\ncompetent nullification of their eighty-gee rocket defenses. They'd been\nappalled by the appearance of a space fleet which--if it had been a\nspace fleet--could have blasted the planet to a cinder. And then they\nwere bewildered that the humans asked no submission--not even promises\nfrom them.\n\nThere was only one conclusion to be drawn. It was that if the humans\nwere willing to be friendly, it would be a good idea to agree. Another\nidea followed. A grand gesture by Huks would be an even better idea.\n\n\"Wait!\" said the interpreter. He turned. A momentary further discussion\namong the Huks. The interpreter turned back.\n\n\"There is a ship here,\" he said uneasily. \"It is a human ship. There are\nhumans in it. The ship is disabled.\"\n\nSergeant Madden affected surprise.\n\n\"Yeah? How come?\"\n\n\"It ar-rived two days ago,\" said the interpreter. Then he plunged. \"We\nbr-rought it. We have a mine on what you call Pr-rocyron Three. The\nhuman ship landed, because it was disabled. It discovered our ship and\nour mine there. We wished to keep the mine secret. Because the humans\nhad found out our secret, we br-rought them here. And the ship. It is\ndisabled.\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" said Sergeant Madden. \"I'll send a repair-boat down to fix\nwhatever's the matter with it. Of course you won't mind.\" He turned\naway, and turned back. \"One of the solar systems we'd like you to take\nover and defend,\" he observed, \"is Procyron. I haven't a list of the\nothers, but when your ship comes over to Varenga it'll be ready. Talk\nour repair-boat down, will you? We'll appreciate anything you can do to\nhelp get the ship back out in space with its passengers, but our\nrepair-boat can manage.\"\n\nHe waved his hand negligently and went back to the squad ship. He got\nin. Patrolman Willis followed him.\n\n\"Take her up,\" said Sergeant Madden.\n\nThe squad ship fell toward the sky. Sergeant Madden said satisfiedly:\n\n\"That went off pretty good. From now on it's just routine.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a bubble in emptiness. It was a large bubble, as such things\ngo. It was nearly a thousand feet in diameter, and it was made of\nmultipoly plastic which is nearly as anomalous as its name. The bubble\ncontained almost an ounce of helium. It had a three-inch small box at\none point on its surface. It floated some twenty-five million miles from\nthe Huk planet, and five million miles from another bubble which was its\nidentical twin. It could reflect detector-pulses. In so doing it\nimpersonated a giant fighting ship.\n\nSomething like an hour after the squad ship rose from Sirene IV, a\ndetonator-cap exploded in the three-inch box. It tore the box to atoms\nand initiated a wave of disintegration in the plastic of the bubble. The\nhelium bubble-content escaped and was lost. The plastic itself turned to\ngas and disappeared.\n\nThe bubble had been capable of exactly two actions. It could reflect\ndetector-pulses. In doing so, it had impersonated a giant fighting ship,\nmember of an irresistible fleet. It could also destroy itself. In so\ndoing, it impersonated a giant fighting ship--one of a fleet--going into\noverdrive.\n\nIn rapid succession, all the bubbles which were members of a\nnon-existent fighting fleet winked out of existence about Sirene IV.\nThere were a great many of them, and no trace of any remained.\n\nThe last was long gone when a small salvage ship descended to the Huk\nhome planet. A heavily accented voice talked it down.\n\nThe salvage ship landed amid evidences of cordiality. The Huks were\nextremely co-operative. They even supplied materials for the repair job\non the _Cerberus_, including landing rockets to be used in case of need.\nBut they weren't needed for take-off. The _Cerberus_ had been landed at\na Huk spaceport, which obligingly lifted it out to space again when its\ndrive had been replaced.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd the squad ship sped through emptiness at a not easily believable\nmultiple of the speed of light. Sergeant Madden dozed, while Patrolman\nWillis performed such actions as were necessary for the progress of the\nship. They were very few. But Patrolman Willis thought feverishly.\n\nAfter a long time Sergeant Madden waked, and blinked, and looked\nbenignly at Patrolman Willis.\n\n\"You'll be back with your wife soon, Willis,\" he said encouragingly.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Then the patrolman said explosively: \"Sergeant! There's\nnothing coming from the Coalsack way! There's nothing for the Huks to\nfight!\"\n\n\"True, at the moment,\" admitted Sergeant Madden, \"but something could\ncome. Not likely--But you see, Willis, the Huks have had armed forces\nfor a long time. They've glamour. They're not ready to cut down and have\nonly cops, like us humans. It wouldn't be reasonable to tell 'em the\ntruth--that there's no need for their fighting men. They'd make a need!\nSo they'll stand guard happily against some kind of monstrosities we'll\nhave Special Cases invent for them. They'll stand guard zestful for\nyears and years! Didn't they do the same against us? But now they're\nproud that even we humans, that they were scared of, ask them to help\nus. So presently they'll send some Huks over to go through the Police\nAcademy, and then presently there'll be a sub-precinct station over\nthere, with Huks in charge, and ... why ... that'll be that.\"\n\n\"But they want planets--\"\n\nSergeant Madden shrugged.\n\n\"There's plenty, Willis. The guess is six thousand million planets fit\nfor humans in this galaxy. And by the time we've used them up,\nsomebody'll have worked out a drive to take us to the next galaxy to\nstart all over. There's no need to worry about that! And for\nimmediate--does it occur to you how many men are going to start getting\nrich because there's a brand-new planet that's got a lot of things we\nhumans would like to have, and wants to buy a lot of things the Huks\nhaven't got?\"\n\nPatrolman Willis subsided. But presently he said:\n\n\"Sergeant ... what'd you have done if they hadn't told you about the\n_Cerberus_?\"\n\nSergeant Madden snorted.\n\n\"It's unthinkable! We waltzed in there, and told them a tale, and showed\nevery sign of walkin' right out again without askin' them a thing. They\ncouldn't even tell us to go to hell, because it looked like we didn't\ncare what they said. It was insupportable, Willis! Characters that make\ntrouble, Willis, do it to feel important. And we'd left them without a\nthing to tell us that was important enough to mention--unless they told\nus about the _Cerberus_. We had 'em baffled. They needed to say\nsomething, and that was the only thing they could say!\"\n\nHe yawned.\n\n\"The _Aldeb_ reports everybody on the _Cerberus_ safe and sound, only\nfrightened, and the skipper said Timmy's girl was less scared than most.\nI'm pleased. Timmy's getting married, and I wouldn't want my\ngrandchildren to have a scary mother!\"\n\nHe looked at the squad ship's instruments. There was a long way yet to\ntravel.\n\n\"A-h-h-h! It's a dull business this, overdrive,\" he said somnolently.\n\"And it's amazing how much a man can sleep when everything's in hand,\nand there's nothing ahead but a wedding and a few things like that. Just\nroutine, Willis. Just routine!\"\n\nHe settled himself more comfortably as the squad ship went on home.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Matter of Importance, by \nWilliam Fitzgerald Jenkins\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A MATTER OF IMPORTANCE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 23636.txt or 23636.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/3/6/3/23636/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Bruce Albrecht, Mary Meehan and\nthe Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\nhttp://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
