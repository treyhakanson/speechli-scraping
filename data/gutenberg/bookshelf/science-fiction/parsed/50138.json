Kurt Zen was an American intelligence officer\namong the many sent to root them out.\n\nHe found them. Taken captive in their hidden lair, he waited as the\nenemy prepared to launch the super missile, the bomb to end all\nbombs--and all life.\n\nIf only he could find the source of the new people's power, Kurt alone\nmight be able to prevent obliteration of the Earth....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                          CAST OF CHARACTERS\n\n\nKURT ZEN\n\nHis loyalty was greater than his love.\n\n\nNEDRA\n\nShe might be a \"new\" person--but she had old emotions.\n\n\nCUSO\n\nHe pitted Oriental cunning against Western ingenuity.\n\n\nSAM WEST\n\nHe wouldn't use his strange powers to help his friends or hurt his\nenemies.\n\n\nJAL JONNER\n\nHe was either a legend or a lunatic.\n\n\nGRANT\n\nHis rescue was a miracle--though they called it a myth.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nThe legends clustering around the new people began before the war,\nwhile the man who started the group, old Jal Jonnor, was alive, but\nthey received their greatest circulation during the conflict.\n\nIf the war is long and the fighting is bitter, with neither side able\nto achieve victory or even a substantial advantage, soldiers eventually\nbegin to tell strange stories of sights seen when death is near, of\nmiraculous deliveries from destruction, of impossible ships seen\nabove the Earth, and even of non-human allies fighting on their side.\nPsychologists, given to believing only what they can see, feel, hear,\nor measure, generally have credited these stories to hallucinations\nresulting from long-sustained stress, or, in the case of the non-human\nallies, to plain, wishful thinking rising out of a deep feeling of\ninsecurity. What psychologist was ever willing to believe that an angel\nsuddenly took over the controls of a falling fighting plane, righting\nthe ship and bringing it down to Earth in a crash landing that enabled\nthe wounded pilot to crawl away, then curing the wound the pilot had\nsustained?\n\nRed-Dog Jimmie Thurman swore this happened to him. He had tangled with\nan Asian fighter group escorting a hot, high level bomber over the\nnorth pole. This was in the early days of the war when such bombers\nstill slipped through the defenses occasionally. Red-Dog Jimmie Thurman\nhad got one of the fighters with a single burst from his guns and\nwas pushing his jet straight up at the soft belly of the bomber far\noverhead when a shell, from an Asian fighter that he had not seen,\nknocked off half of his right wing. A fragment of the exploding shell\nhit him in the right shoulder, mangling the flesh and the bone.\n\nSpinning like a leaf being whirled over and over in a hurricane, the\nplane started the long plunge downward toward the polar ice cap below.\nJimmie couldn't work the seat ejection mechanism because of his broken\narm.\n\nJust before the ship crashed, he realized that someone else was in the\ncockpit with him, fighting to take over the controls. Since Jimmie was\nstill in the seat, this was not easy, but somehow the other one had\nmanaged, not only to take over the controls, but had been able to bring\nthe ship down in a crash landing. The other one pulled Jimmie out of\nthe burning wreck. Then, discovering Jimmie's broken, mangled shoulder,\n\"it\" had cured it.\n\nAt least this was the story Red-Dog Jimmie Thurman had told after a\nhelicopter had picked him up and had taken him back to his base. He\nwas very stubborn about it, defiantly insisting that someone else had\nbrought the plane down. The only conclusion Jimmie had been able to\nreach about the other one in the cockpit with him--he did not know\nwhether it was male or female--was that it had been one of the new\npeople.\n\nWhen the psychos had asked him how another human being could have\ngotten into a falling plane while it was still thousands of feet in the\nair, Jimmie had had no answer, except to point out that since the new\npeople were apparently able to accomplish feats beyond the power of an\nordinary mortal, they were probably not human.\n\nThis comment had marked him as permanently unfit for flight duty.\nJimmie began to grieve his heart out at this, for he had really loved\nflying. Then he began to wonder why the new people--presuming they\nexisted--would save his life at the cost of his sanity. He went over\nthe hill a year later.\n\nWith Spike Larson it was different. Larson was the commander of an\natomic-powered submarine operating in the Persian Gulf. He was lying\ndoggo on the bottom waiting for a fat convoy that should be hugging the\nshore when three destroyers smelled him out. Larson never knew quite\nhow they had spotted him, but he was in shallow water and, when the\nfirst depth charges went off, he knew he had to head for the depths.\n\nWith charges on the port side making his plates creak, he headed for\nthe channel. The scanning beam reported rocks dead ahead. Swiftly\nchecking his charts, he discovered that no such rocks existed.\n\nCursing, Larson flung the charts across the room. Either they were\nwrong or the bottom here had shifted. A boom ahead told him it made no\ndifference. His escape had been cut off by a destroyer in the channel.\n\n\"We'll take her up and fight it out on the surface,\" he told the\nlieutenant with him.\n\nThe officer's face went white at the order. But he was a navy man.\n\"Aye, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"I would recommend otherwise, commander,\" another voice spoke.\n\nLarson and the lieutenant froze. There was no one else in the control\nroom. When Larson finally managed to turn his head, he found he was\nwrong in his belief that no one else was in the control room.\n\nTelling the story later, to a naval board of inquiry, he said.\n\"She was standing right there beside me, all in shining white, the\nmost beautiful woman I have ever seen. I was too dazed to act, too\nbewildered to think. A woman on my ship! And what a woman! While I\nstood there like a dummy, she stepped forward to the controls. 'With\nyour permission, commander, there is a new channel close inshore that\ndoes not show on the charts. The bottom here has shifted quite a lot\nsince this area was last mapped. The destroyers will not dare follow us\ninto the new channel, even if they know of its existence, because of\nthe danger from rocks on one side and from sand banks on the other. If\nyou will give me permission to con the ship--'\"\n\n\"All I could do was nod,\" Larson reported to the board of inquiry. \"As\nit turned out, this was the last command I ever gave in all my life.\nShe turned the nose of the sub seventy degrees, pulled in the scope,\nshut off the depth finders and the sonar, and sent us up until we were\nalmost breaking the surface. While she was doing all this, she also\ndodged two depth charges that should have got us. She scraped paint off\nour port bow on a set of rocks that should have snatched the guts out\nof us; she dodged a sandy bottom on our starboard where we ought to\nhave hung up like sitting ducks under the guns of the destroyers, but\nshe took us out of that hole and into deep water. Then she turned the\ncontrols back to Lieutenant Thompson, and said, 'Thank you, commander.\nI'm sure you can handle the situation very competently from now on.'\"\n\nThe members of the board of inquiry were leaning forward in their\nchairs so as not to miss a word of Larson's report. When he had\nfinished, the senior member, an admiral, asked breathlessly, \"And then\nwhat happened to her, commander?\"\n\n\"She vanished,\" Larson said.\n\nThe admiral collapsed like a punctured balloon.\n\n\"Lieutenant Thompson will back up every word I have said,\" Larson\ncontinued. He shook his head to indicate that he still couldn't\nunderstand it, though he had thought of little else since the day it\nhad happened.\n\n\"Who do you think she was, commander?\" a member of the board asked.\n\n\"I think she was one of the new people,\" Larson answered. His voice was\nfirm but he was still shaking his head when he walked out of the room\nwhere the board had met.\n\nThey gave him shore duty. The psychos did all they could for him, but\nsomething seemed to have snapped inside his brain. Eight months later\nhe deserted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen there was the story of Colonel Edward Grant, USAF. Grant was the\nonly man aboard the new Earth satellite station. He was the only man\naboard because at that time no way had been found to build and to\nlaunch a satellite that would carry more than one passenger. In fact,\nno way had been found to do more than launch such a station and get it\ninto its orbit. It could not return because it could not carry enough\nfuel for the return journey. A spaceship was being built which would\ncarry additional fuel and food supplies to it, but this vessel was not\nyet completed when the satellite was launched.\n\nGrant, who had flown everything with wings, volunteered to ride with\nthe station and put it in its orbit, knowing that when the power was\nexhausted he might be marooned in space forever.\n\nHowever, neither he nor anyone else had anticipated that he would\nbe marooned. This eventuality had only occurred when the production\ndemands of the new war forced a halt on the construction of his rescue\nship.\n\nColonel Grant became the loneliest man in the history of Earth. The\nstars were his companions. Only the moon kept him company. He would\nremain a lonely Flying Dutchman of the sky, until the end of the\nwar permitted finishing the ship that would bring him relief. Or\nforever--whichever came first.\n\nIt was inevitable that the Asians would get the idea that he was spying\non them as he passed in his regular orbit far above their heads. In\nreality, this was sheer nonsense; he was much too high to make out any\nmilitary details of any importance whatsoever. Also, they were taking\nfull advantage of his broadcasts of scientific information, which could\nbe obtained by tuning in to the bands he used.\n\nIn an effort to remove this imagined menace from the sky above them,\nthe Asians fired a rocket torpedo at his satellite.\n\nColonel Grant, reporting later on what had happened, said, \"That\ntorpedo must have been on its way, when the little man appeared on my\nsatellite. He told me about the rocket that was coming my way. I told\nhim this was very interesting but that I didn't see what the hell I\ncould do about it. The station had no power and couldn't be moved. I\ndidn't even have a chute, and even if I had had one I couldn't have\nused it. Anybody who jumped from that height would have frozen to death\nlong before he reached enough air to sustain life. Describe the little\nman for you? Sure, general. He looked like a miniature Moses, white\nbeard, glittering eyes and everything else. No, general, I never saw\nMoses. Clothes? A loin cloth, general. No, sir I am not making light of\nthe dignity of this court, I am telling in the words at my command what\nI saw happen with my own eyes.\"\n\nAt this point, the colonel's voice became a little stiff. The general\nshut up. A man who had done what Grant had done might snap a general's\nhead off and get away with it.\n\n\"What happened next? The miniature Moses told me he was going to land\nthe satellite. He said that even if they missed with this torpedo they\nwould be sure to try again, for no reason except to give the morale of\ntheir own people a big boost.\"\n\n\"Land the satellite, colonel?\" the general asked again. \"But as I\nunderstand it, the station was without power!\"\n\n\"You understand the situation correctly, general. But that was what he\nsaid and that was what he did. In as neat a landing as I ever saw. And\nif you don't believe me, you can go look for yourself.\"\n\nThe space satellite sitting in the middle of a Kansas wheat field was\nevidence that could not be ignored. It was solid, it was metal, it was\nreal. Colonel Grant might have gone wacky from the stress of remaining\ntoo long in space, but the station, at least, had remained sane. Power\nmust have been used to move it. But what power?\n\nColonel Grant could not answer the question of what happened to the\nminiature Moses after the station had been landed. He flung up his\nhands. \"Moses went the same way he came, without me seeing him.\"\n\nOn the basis of Grant's report, an investigation was begun. A vast mass\nof data was assembled, some of it dating from the time of Jal Jonnor,\nbut when no practical results were immediately forthcoming, the project\nwas shelved, at least temporarily. Its manpower was desperately needed\nfor other purposes. Men fighting for their lives have no time to think\nof the future.\n\nThis dusty, forgotten mass of data was exhumed by a tall, lean man\nnamed Kurt Zen, a colonel of intelligence, who had a reputation for\ndaring even among that elite band of men who daily looked death in the\nface.\n\nZen was assigned to this investigation, not only because of his\nreputation, but because the stories of the new people had increased in\nnumber to the point where they had to be given some credence. Also,\nthey became more fantastic in content. For instance, a bomber pilot\ninsisted that a woman had ridden on the wing of his ship all the way to\nAsia, dropping from the plane in the highlands of western China. Zen\nregarded this story as obvious hallucination. Much of the data about\nthe new people belonged in this category. He morosely wondered if it\nwas possible to tell where reality left off and hallucination began.\nThe colonel soon discovered that his job was not going to be as easy as\nhe'd hoped.\n\nAside from the stories told by the soldiers--and the Asian fighting men\nalso had their tales to tell--only one thing was certain: if the new\npeople existed at all, they were very elusive. Only the grave of the\nman who had founded the group, old Jal Jonnor, was still to be found in\nthe high Sierras of California. Zen did not go looking for this grave,\nbut he saw photographs of it. He also studied the biographies that had\nbeen compiled on this colossal but enigmatical figure. Were the grave\nand the thick files the only remaining evidence that at least one\nhuman had dared to dream of a new day? Zen did not think so. Most of\nall, he longed to capture one of the new people for questioning.\n\nThen, in a daring coup that was intended to strike a spearhead at the\nheart of America, Cuso, the top Asian fighting leader, and thousands\nof tough Asian paratroopers floated down into the mountains between\nBritish Columbia and the United States.\n\nCuso and his men, hiding out in the high mountain ranges, resisted all\nefforts to dislodge them. They became a festering thorn in the side\nof America, a threat that was not quite big enough to take seriously,\nor slight enough to overlook. He was hidden so deep in the mountain\ncaverns that he could not be bombed out and the terrain was so rugged\nthat his paratroopers could withstand the assault of a full army.\n\nAs his men began making forays into the lower ranges, searching for\nfood and women, the inhabitants of the area fled in terror.\n\nThis was the situation when Kurt Zen accompanied a body of troops up\nthe last fairly good trail toward Cuso's hidden lair. Neither the\ntroops nor Cuso really interested him. What interested him was an army\nnurse with the medical detachment. He suspected this nurse was one of\nthe new people.\n\nIn months of patient, painstaking work, she was the only good lead to\nthis group that he had uncovered.\n\nHe was going up a steep mountain trail, with troops ahead and behind,\nwhen something that sounded like a wounded lion began to cough in the\nsky overhead.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nKurt Zen heard the lion cough in the sky overhead. He knew that it\nwould hit in about four minutes and that it would seem to open a tunnel\nupward from hell, that the mountains would shake and tremble, that the\nair would vibrate and rattle as if a dozen thunderbolts had exploded\nat the same instant, and that a good number of the troops laboriously\ncircling the incline of the ridge above would die.\n\nHe knew that more of them would die a horrible lingering death as a\nresult of the radioactivity that would be released by the blast.\n\n\"Pardon me, Nedra,\" he said to the nurse, who was just ahead of him.\n\nShe had stopped to stare upward.\n\n\"Hit the dirt!\" Zen yelled at the troops. A few had already heard\nthe lion cough in the sky and had begun to take cover, following the\npattern of experienced fighters who never need an order to dive for the\nnearest hole. He saw, as he shouted, that the number who had already\nbegun to hit the dirt was pitifully few and he knew the reason for\nthis. Most of these men were green conscripts on their first fighting\nmission, the results of digging deep into a population that had already\nbeen scoured to the bone for manpower--and for everything else.\nConscripts were likely to stare at the sky and die with their mouths\nopen.\n\n\"What is it?\" the girl asked. \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Don't you hear that blooper in the sky overhead?\"\n\n\"No. That is, I heard something make a noise up there. But--\" Mixed\nemotions moved across her face but fear was not among them. Instead,\nshe seemed to be curious. \"But what is a blooper?\"\n\nFrom a nurse, or from any living American, such a question was\nincredible. Zen stared at her in amazement.\n\n\"Did I say the wrong thing, ask the wrong question?\"\n\n\"You sure did,\" Zen answered. \"Come on.\"\n\n\"But where are we going?\"\n\n\"There!\" He nodded toward a prospect hole, one of the many that had\nbeen dug in these mountains by miners. As soon as he had heard the\nblooper cough its interrupted rocket blast when it changed direction in\nthe sky, he had instantly looked for a hiding place. This tunnel seemed\nto fill the bill.\n\n\"Is something going to happen?\" the nurse asked.\n\n\"In less than two minutes you will find out,\" he answered. His long\nlegs had already started taking him toward the hole. After hesitating\nfor an instant, the nurse hastily followed him.\n\nThe prospect hole extended less than ten feet into the side of the\nmountain and was not timbered. This was good. It meant no heavy beams\nwould collapse around their heads when the hills began to shake. A\nquick examination revealed that the stone of the roof seemed to be\nsolid. Zen stopped within three feet of the entrance.\n\n\"Why don't we go farther back?\" the nurse asked.\n\n\"We're in far enough for protection from bits of flying metal but not\ntoo far to dig ourselves out if the roof should collapse--I hope,\" Zen\nanswered.\n\nSomewhere outside a man screamed, in terror.\n\nThe thing in the sky coughed again, closer now.\nBRRROOOMMM----BrrroooMMM----BrOOOm!\n\nThe blooper struck.\n\nThe sound was that of the simultaneous firing of many cannon. The\nwalls of the prospect tunnel seemed to twist and wave. Loose stones\ndropped from the roof and a fine dust seemed to extrude from the walls.\nA boulder half as big as a small house hurtled past the entrance,\nsnapping pines like matchsticks. A slide of loose rocks followed it.\nIn the distance another slide could be heard growling back at the sky\nas it grew to avalanche proportions.\n\nThe nurse's fingers tightened on Zen's arm, then relaxed. Every nerve\nin his body was as taut as a steel wire as he waited for her reaction.\nOther than the tightening and relaxing of her fingers, there was none.\nHer hands remained on his arm and she remained in the tunnel with him.\nTo Kurt Zen, this was disappointing.\n\n\"What kind of nerves do you have? Most women would have been in my arms\nand would have had their noses buried in my chest.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, colonel, if my education in how to be afraid has been\nneglected.\" She coughed at the dust.\n\n\"Aren't you really afraid, Nedra?\" he asked.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then you aren't an ordinary human!\" The instant he had blurted out the\nwords, he was sorry he had spoken. It was possible to give away too\nmuch too soon.\n\n\"Then what am I?\" Her voice was calm.\n\nHe dodged her question. \"Aren't you even afraid to die?\"\n\n\"When so many have died already, why should I hesitate to join them?\"\nthe nurse answered. She released his arm and brushed dust from the\nshoulders of her uniform. She glanced up at him and it seemed that some\nkind of a radiation flowed from her eyes, a wave of it that sent a\ntingle over his entire skin surface. Outside, another smaller boulder\nwent bouncing past the entrance to the tunnel. Fumbling in his pockets\nfor cigarettes, Zen found a crumpled package. He offered one to the\nnurse but she thanked him and refused it. He did not insist. Cigarettes\nwere too precious to waste on people who didn't really want them.\nOutside, another man began to scream. The nurse moved automatically in\nthat direction. He caught her arm and held her back.\n\n\"Wait until the rocks stop rolling, Nedra.\"\n\nShe did not protest. Looking up at him, she said, \"You think I'm one of\nthe new people, don't you?\"\n\nZen coughed and swore at the cigarette, insisting that the tobacco\nwas moist. This was a lie and both knew it. But--what to say? Her\nquestion was a complete stunner. \"What makes you think that?\" he asked,\ndesperate for words.\n\n\"I just think it. It's true, isn't it?\"\n\nAs an intelligence officer, Zen was accustomed to asking the questions,\nbut this nurse had completely turned the tables on him. He took a deep\ndrag on the cigarette. \"I don't know. Are you?\" He made his voice as\ncasual as was possible.\n\nHer eyes studied him. The trace of a smile came over her face and\ntugged at the comers of her lips. \"Do you mind if I ask you a question?\"\n\n\"Go right ahead.\" The man had stopped screaming outside but another\nboulder was going past. In the distance, the avalanche was trying to\ngrind to a halt but it sounded as if millions of tons of rock were on\nthe move to a safer location.\n\n\"Are _you_ one of the new people?\" the nurse asked.\n\nThe cough was real this time. Zen could not suppress his surprise.\n\"What on earth makes you ask a question like that?\"\n\n\"I just felt like asking it,\" the nurse replied. \"Am I wrong?\"\n\n\"Who are the new people?\"\n\n\"Why, everybody has heard of them. They're the new race that is going\nto provide the nucleus for new growth after all ordinary men and women\nhave been destroyed in this war.\" Surprise showed in her violet eyes.\n\"Do you mean you have never heard of them?\"\n\n\"I've heard the usual rumors that are afloat,\" Zen said, shrugging.\n\"But all the stories have impressed me as a pack of lies. Really, I\nthink the enemy has started most of them, to get us to relax our war\neffort.\"\n\n\"Do you honestly think that?\" Her voice had a puzzled note in it. \"I\nmean, honestly and truly.\"\n\n\"I think what the evidence tells me to think, nothing less. In this\ncase, I have seen none of the so-called evidence.\"\n\nShrugging, Zen moved toward the opening of the tunnel, then drew back\nas a mass of rock crashed outside. \"It's raining boulders out there,\"\nhe said. \"What do you know about the so-called new people?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" she answered.\n\n\"You're a very lovely liar, but the fact that you are lovely doesn't\nmake you any less a liar,\" Zen said. She was very beautiful with her\nviolet eyes and bronze hair, but an overworked intelligence officer\ncould not be concerned with these things.\n\n\"Thank you, colonel,\" she said. \"But I do not relish being called a\nliar.\" Her face showed hurt, just the right amount of it, but at the\nsame time her eyes laughed at him. \"However, I guess there is nothing I\ncan do about it, is there?\" Somehow she contrived to look like a small\ngirl who has been unjustly accused of some deed she has not committed.\n\nIn the distance the avalanche had ground to a halt. Now, no more\nboulders were bounding down the hill. A vast, puzzled silence held the\nmountains. In that silence, Zen fancied he could hear the thoughts of\nthe frightened men who had remained alive thus far, and were wondering\nhow to prolong their precarious existence. They were also wondering if\nstaying alive was worth the effort involved. Why not give up now and be\ndone with all tragedy, with all tears, with all trying to find the road\nto the future?\n\nUp the trail a man began to scream.\n\nLike a homing pigeon that has finally found the right direction,\nthe nurse moved toward the sound. Zen caught her arm again. Looking\npuzzled, she stopped. \"Please, colonel. I am needed up there.\" She\nnodded up the slope in the direction of the screaming man.\n\n\"You are probably needed by many others,\" he commented.\n\nShe did not seem to understand. \"But I am a nurse. It is my duty to\nhelp those who are wounded.\"\n\n\"I know.\" He was a little startled to find himself in sympathy with\nthis impulse. \"But, not yet.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because that slope is still too hot to be safe.\" He held up his left\nwrist. Instead of a watch, he wore a miniature radiation counter there.\nThe needle was creeping up toward the red line.\n\n\"The radiation count is about forty right here at the mouth of this\nprospect hole,\" he pointed out.\n\n\"That is interesting,\" the nurse said. The tone of her voice said it\nwas not important.\n\n\"Halfway up the slope, it will hit a hundred. At the top of the ridge,\nwhere the explosion took place, the count may reach a thousand.\" In his\nopinion, he had said enough.\n\nIn her opinion, he had not said anything at all. \"That makes no\ndifference. Wounded men are up there. I am a nurse. My duty is clear to\nme.\"\n\n\"If you try to help them under these circumstances, you will become a\ncasualty yourself.\"\n\n\"But what of the men who need help?\"\n\n\"They will simply have to get out of the radiation zone themselves, or\nwait until the area is clear and help can reach them.\"\n\n\"You are heartless!\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" he denied. \"If anything could be done to help them I\nwould be doing it. Don't you understand what has happened? That was an\nAsian N bomb that exploded. In an N bomb the immediate effect is minor.\nThe real purpose of the weapon is to spray the area with high intensity\nradiation, to make the ground unfit for living for months. Any living\ncreature caught within the direct blast of the radiation is doomed, and\nneither you, nor I, nor the medics, can do anything to help them--\" He\nbroke off as another man began screaming up the slope.\n\nThe nurse was irresolute. \"But that man needs help,\" she pointed out.\n\n\"Certainly he needs help,\" Zen agreed.\n\n\"Well--\"\n\nZen watched her carefully. She seemed to understand his words but\nsomething else pulled at her far more strongly: the screaming of the\ninjured man. Each time the soldier cried out, she started in his\ndirection.\n\n\"Well, well, thank you, colonel.\" Turning, she moved with a sure stride\nup the slope.\n\nZen swore under his breath and started after her, then caught the\nmotion as the question rose in him as to why she should throw her\nlife away. She knew the meaning of radiation in lethal quantities.\nUnquestionably, she also knew what would happen to any normal human who\nventured into a hot zone.\n\nWas she, then, a normal human being? Was he actually witnessing one of\nthe miracles performed by the new people? If she came off the mountain\nslope alive, it would certainly prove something. Zen cursed again. She\nwas going where he could not safely follow. If she returned unharmed,\nhe had enough proof to warrant following her to the ends of the earth,\nif need be.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThe radio transmitter inside Zen's pack was small but very powerful.\nIt did not look like a radio transmitter at all; there was no antenna\nand no apparent source of power. Only the tiny earphone and the throat\nmicrophone revealed its true nature.\n\nHe slipped the phone into his ear, fitted the microphone against his\nthroat, then picked up the piece of plastic tubing that was red on one\nend and green on the other. Wires ran from each end of this tube to the\nsmall box that housed the transmitter.\n\n\"Red goes to the right hand,\" he muttered. \"Green to the left. Or is it\nthe other way around?\" Making up his mind that red went to the right,\nhe closed his fingers around the ends of the plastic tube, then watched\nthe tiny meter on top of the small box that contained the transmitter.\n\nThe needle moved on the dial.\n\n\"Calling nine dash nine,\" he spoke. \"This is six one calling nine dash\nnine.\" He repeated the call three times, then sat back on his haunches\nto await an answer.\n\n\"Come in six one,\" the earphone said. \"What color is red?\"\n\n\"It's green this week,\" Zen answered promptly.\n\n\"What color was it last week?\"\n\n\"Last week? Um. Oh, yes. No color.\"\n\n\"And that means--\"\n\n\"White. This is Kurt Zen, colonel, intelligence, reporting. Connect me\nimmediately with General Stocker.\"\n\nSatisfied with the identity of the caller, the operator said, \"Just a\nminute, colonel, I'll see if the general will talk to you.\"\n\n\"Tell him it's important,\" Zen urged.\n\n\"They always say that,\" the operator sighed. \"I'll put you through as\nsoon as I can.\"\n\n\"Kurt, boy, where are you?\" General Stacker's voice boomed into a\ndistant microphone. The general's voice always boomed, he was always\nhearty, he was always sure that while things might look black right\nnow, they would work out all right in the end. By the time the booming\nvoice reached Zen's earphone, it had been transformed into a tinny\nsqueak. Kurt thought he detected an uneasy note in the squeak and he\nwondered if the general had finally glimpsed the end, and was finding\nit not quite as he had supposed.\n\n\"In hell, general,\" Zen answered. He swiftly told where he was and what\nhad happened. \"Cuso's blooper knocked out the last pass by which we can\nbring an effective force against him. This whole area is loaded with\nradiation.\"\n\n\"How will we ever root that bastard out of his hole now?\"\n\n\"That's for the staff to decide. I have more important news.\"\n\n\"Yes? Talk, Kurt, and fast. You don't mean that you--\"\n\n\"Yes. I mean I think this nurse may be it. I don't know yet.\" Zen\nexplained what had happened.\n\n\"Damn it, Kurt, do you mean to tell me that if she comes back alive,\nyou will know she is immune to the radiation, and hence must be one of\nthe new people? But if she comes back dead, or so loaded with radiation\nthat she will die within a few days, then you will know she was just\nlike all the rest of us?\" Even through Zen's earphone, the general's\nvoice had begun to boom.\n\n\"That's the way I see it,\" Zen answered.\n\n\"But goddammit--Are you hurt, Kurt?\" The general's voice was suddenly\nsolicitous. \"Are you all right?\"\n\n\"Damn it, I'm in my right mind,\" Zen answered. \"I was in a prospect\nhole when the blast went off. Don't you think I've got enough sense\nto take cover?\" Stocker's suddenly solicitous attitude irritated him.\n\"Sorry, sir,\" he apologized an instant later.\n\n\"It's quite all right, boy. I know that nerves get frayed in combat.\nBut this nurse--\"\n\n\"That's the way I see it, sir,\" Zen said doggedly. \"I request\npermission to follow her.\"\n\n\"If she comes back alive, you mean?\"\n\n\"I would appreciate it if you would stop reminding me of that\npossibility.\"\n\n\"Oh. So you are emotionally interested in her?\"\n\n\"Well, what if I am? She's a nice kid.\"\n\n\"They all are, boy. They all are--until you get to know them. As to\npermission to follow her, you've not only got it, but it's an order.\nWe've got to find out about these new people. One of them appeared in\nPresident Wilkerson's private office this morning and told him to call\noff a planned landing in Asia.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Zen said. \"In the President's office!\"\n\n\"That's what I said.\"\n\n\"Did it really happen? I mean, was anyone present?\"\n\n\"No one except the President's secretary. She's under heavy sedation\nright now, from shock. She thought God Almighty Himself had come\nwalking in. The old man is not in much better shape.\" Stocker's voice\nshowed signs of strain. \"I've got my orders from Wilkerson himself and\nI'm passing them on to you. _Find these new people!_ Follow that nurse\nto hell if you have to.\"\n\n\"Right, sir.\"\n\n\"Report to me when you have something to report--that is, something\nbesides going to bed with her. Off.\" Zen grimaced as he pulled the tiny\nphone out of his ear. He slipped the transmitter back into the pack and\nslung it over his shoulder. The radiation count was dropping but it was\nstill too high for safety. He looked longingly up the trail. Wounded\nmen were coming down but Nedra was not in sight.\n\nThe wounded men were no longer a fighting unit, but had become\nindividuals, each one intent only on his own survival. Patriotism had\ngone from their minds, they no longer gave a hoot about saving their\ncountry, but were only interested in saving their own lives.\n\nFar up the trail, Zen could see a tall figure moving upward. The nurse!\nHe unslung the pair of field glasses from his shoulder. Through the\npowerful lenses Nedra's lithe figure was very clear. He saw her move\nto the side of the trail and kneel beside a wounded man who lacked\nthe courage to walk downhill. Somehow she got the man to his feet\nand started him along the trail. He stumbled and fell. Again the\nnurse knelt beside him but this time she made no attempt to lift him.\nInstead, she got to her own feet.\n\nZen decided the man had died as he fell.\n\nShe continued on up the slope.\n\nDown below, motors roared and then came to a halt. Turning, Zen saw\nthat a first aid station was being set up down there. The medics worked\nfast; already they were directing the wounded men to the back end of a\ntruck, where an examination station had been set up. But, fast as they\nworked, they were too late to help the vast majority of the wounded.\nThe futility of the effort depressed Zen, so he returned his attention\nto the nurse.\n\nShe was in the middle of the trail again. The avalanche, directly ahead\nof her, had stopped her progress. A man was with her.\n\nThrough the glasses, the man looked as tall and craggy as a mountain\npeak. No soldier, he was without helmet or other headgear. His hair,\nwhite as the snow on top of a mountain, was flying in the wind. His\nface looked like a statue hewn in granite. Zen guessed that he was a\nresident of this region, a mountaineer who had sought safety in these\nremote fastnesses, and who had been blasted out of his hiding place by\nCuso's radioactive blooper and was wandering down this trail to die.\nThe nurse was talking to him.\n\nInvoluntarily, as if they had a will of their own, Zen's legs started\ncarrying him up the slope. He had taken a dozen steps before he\nremembered the counter on his wrist.\n\n\"To hell with the count!\" he thought. \"I'm going up there and drag her\ndown here. She's not going to throw her life away while I skulk like\na coward down below. I don't give a damn whether she's one of the new\npeople or not. She's human!\"\n\nHe climbed the slope with giant strides. Then he saw that Nedra was\nrunning toward him and waving him back.\n\n\"Colonel! You can't come up here.\"\n\n\"I _am_ coming up there!\" he shouted in reply.\n\n\"No!\"\n\nWhen he did not stop, she ran faster toward him. The craggy man kept\npace with her. Reaching Zen, she caught his sleeve, turned him around,\nand started him down the slope. \"You can't be here.\" Her voice was\nbreathless with protest.\n\n\"Are you giving me orders?\" Zen growled. Secretly he was pleased\nbecause she was concerned about him.\n\n\"If you will permit me, colonel, I think Nedra's intention is to save\nyour life,\" the craggy man spoke. He had a voice like a bell tolling\nin the distance, sweet-toned and musical, but with overtones of great\nstrength.\n\n\"What about _her_ life?\" Zen demanded.\n\n\"I'm going down now, colonel,\" the nurse said hastily. \"They've set up\na first aid station. They will need me there.\"\n\n\"You will need their attention is what you mean,\" Zen said.\n\n\"Colonel, the counter!\" she answered.\n\nThe needle was well over the hundred mark and was still rising.\n\n\"Come, colonel.\" Hooking her arm in his, Nedra began moving down the\nrough, boulder-strewn trail. Zen did not move. She tugged harder.\n\n\"Your life is in danger here, sir,\" the craggy man said, politely.\n\n\"That is of interest to me only,\" Zen answered. \"And what about your\nlife?\"\n\n\"Colonel, I'd like you to meet a friend of mine,\" the nurse said\nquickly. \"Colonel Zen, Sam West. We'll talk while we walk down to the\nfirst aid station.\"\n\n\"A pleasure to meet you, sir,\" West said, extending his hand. His\nhandclasp was firm but there was a suggestion of additional power in\nhis fingers.\n\n\"Nice to meet you, Mr. West. Do you live around here?\"\n\n\"Over that way,\" the craggy man said, nodding vaguely over his\nshoulder.\n\nAgain the nurse tugged at Zen's arm. He set his feet solidly on the\nmountain trail. \"We'll talk right here.\"\n\n\"But you are taking an unfair advantage of Nedra,\" the craggy man\nprotested. \"This area is heavy with radiation and this is neither the\ntime nor the place to be swapping horses.\"\n\n\"Then why are you two here?\"\n\n\"I was getting out of the area as fast as I could when I met Nedra,\"\nWest said. \"I would still be getting out of it, but fast, if you were\nnot stopping me.\"\n\n\"I'm not stopping you,\" Zen said. \"There's the trail. Hit it. Nor you\neither,\" he said to Nedra.\n\n\"Don't be silly, Kurt,\" the nurse said. She was pleading with him now.\n\n\"All right. But on one condition. Why did you come up here in the first\nplace? You knew the area was hot.\"\n\n\"I--I lost my head,\" the nurse said promptly. \"My emotions ran away\nwith me. I'm a nurse and wounded men needed my attention. I went to\nthem. You will come down the trail with us, won't you?\" The violet eyes\nbegged him to believe in her.\n\n\"What made you lose your head?\"\n\n\"Why--shock, I suppose. This is the first time I was bombed. Also, the\nscreaming of the wounded. Really, sir, I am a nurse.\" The way she said\nthe word, being a nurse meant something. The violet eyes had grown\ntired of begging and were on the verge of spitting anger at him.\n\n\"I don't believe a damned word you have said,\" Zen said. \"You didn't\nlose your head back there in the prospect hole.\"\n\n\"Please, Kurt.\" Again she rugged at his arm. \"I'll talk to you all you\nwant down below. But don't try to force me to stay here.\"\n\nReluctantly, Zen yielded to the pressure on his arm. Relief appeared in\nthe violet eyes and the face of the craggy man showed a sudden release\nfrom some inner strain. Dimly, he thought he had seen that craggy face\nsomewhere before but the picture that flicked through his mind was\ngone before he could fit a time and place tag on it. Going down the\ntrail, he steered the nurse toward a truck where the medics had set up\nequipment to test the amount of exposure to radiation. In doing this,\nhe discovered that she was steering him in the same direction.\n\n\"I don't need the medics,\" he protested. \"I'm all right. I wasn't\nexposed long enough to do any damage.\"\n\n\"Of course you're all right,\" she answered. Her tone was similar to\nthat of an indulgent mother reassuring a hurt child.\n\n\"You're the one who needs help,\" he said. He was certain she had\nremained too long.\n\n\"I'm going to get it if I need it,\" she said, soothingly.\n\nZen could hear the occasional crunch of boots behind them. West was\nkeeping silent. He did not seem to be in a hurry.\n\nZen started to speak to Nedra. The thought of what he wanted to say was\ndim in his mind and he could not quite find words for it but he knew\nthat it had something to do with a wish that the world were different\nand that the human race were not trying to destroy itself. Why should\nhe be wishing this? The reason for his thinking became a little\nclearer. He was wishing the world were different so that he might make\nlove to this nurse under conditions that would permit this love to bear\nother fruit than frustration, despair, and death.\n\nHe found himself wishing that a vine-covered cottage existed somewhere,\na place where a man and a woman might live in peace and reasonable\nsecurity, raising some kids who could play on a mountain slope that was\nnot saturated with atomic radiation.\n\n\"Here is the first aid station,\" the nurse said. \"And--\"\n\n\"And what?\" he asked her when she did not continue.\n\nShe gave his arm a squeeze. \"And thank you for the dream,\" she\nwhispered.\n\nAs Kurt Zen turned startled eyes toward her, wondering how she had\nknown what he had been dreaming, her face seemed to dissolve in a gray\nmist.\n\nHe plunged, unconscious, to the ground at her feet.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThe jar of striking the ground seemed to bring the intelligence agent\nback to consciousness instantly. As Nedra started to kneel beside him,\nhe was already getting to his feet. She tried to help him rise. He\nshrugged her hand away.\n\n\"What happened?\" she asked.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said. This didn't seem quite right. \"I--I--\" He tried to\nthink what had happened. \"I fainted. That's all. I just fainted.\" To\nhim, this seemed a reasonable explanation for everything that needed\nexplaining.\n\nNedra seemed to think otherwise. \"But men like you don't just faint,\"\nshe protested.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"They don't faint unless something is wrong with them,\" Nedra\ncontinued. \"Are you sure you're not suffering from delayed shock\nfollowing the bomb explosion? Or--\" Her voice slid away into silence as\nif she were afraid to voice the thought that was in her mind. Behind\nher, West said nothing.\n\n\"I just did it,\" Zen said, becoming more indignant. \"I fainted. Who\nsays it can't be done?\" Confusion existed somewhere. He was sure it was\nthe nurse who was confused. He shook his head in an effort to clear up\nher difficulty.\n\n\"I saw you do it. All I am trying to say is that perhaps there may be a\nreason for it.\"\n\n\"Nope,\" Zen said. \"I'm not going to the aid station. No reason for it.\nI'm all right. It's the world out there that is wrong.\" This made sense\nto him.\n\n\"I know you are all right,\" Nedra answered. Her face showed strain.\n\"But it might be a good idea to have the doctors check, just to make\nsure.\"\n\nZen, busy shaking his head again, hardly heard her. He had the\nimpression that her confusion would clear up in a minute. Somehow it\nreminded him of the confusion that he had suffered after inhaling a\nwhiff of nerve gas, once. When had this happened? He was not sure, now.\nPerhaps it had taken place in the remote past, perhaps on some other\nplanet ... he realized his mind was wandering. Again he shook his head.\n\n\"But I really think, colonel--\"\n\n\"I wasn't shaking my head at you,\" Zen corrected.\n\n\"Good. Then we will go see the doctors.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that either. I was shaking my head to clear it. There's\na fog in it.\"\n\n\"A fog in your head?\" Unease appeared in her voice.\n\n\"Yes. What's wrong with that? Lots of men have fogs in their heads.\" To\nhim, this seemed a reasonable statement. \"Lots of men have to go to the\ndocs every couple of weeks to have the fogs blown out of their heads.\"\nThinking he had made a joke, he laughed.\n\nNedra did not think he had said anything funny. Resolutely, she took\nhis arm. \"Come with me, colonel.\" As she led him toward the truck which\nthe medics were using for a first aid station, something happened.\n\nHe saw clearly.\n\nHe saw everything.\n\nThe ability to see came suddenly, out of nowhere. One second it was not\nthere. Then it was there. It was like seeing with eyes, except it was\nbetter than ocular perception had ever been. With it, he was not only\nable to see surfaces, he could also see into the interior of things.\nAn acute understanding of what he saw went with the perception.\n\nHe saw that the Universe was as tall as a man, and no taller. He saw\nthat it was as wide as a man, and no wider. He saw that it was as broad\nas a man, and no broader.\n\nHe saw the human race in its entirety, one man and all men, all men in\none man. Simultaneously, he saw the whole history of the race, he saw\nthe long journey it had made from so-called inanimate matter to the\npoint where it was now a creature that looked outward to the stars. He\nsaw that the destiny of the race lay in those stars, and in all that\nvast expanse of space between them, if it did not destroy itself in\nthe process of growing to star stature. He saw that the race could do\nexactly this, that it could blow itself back to the component atoms\nthat composed it, in which case the long and toilsome, heart-breaking\nstruggle upward from the atomic level would have to begin all over\nagain.\n\nHe also knew what he was doing with this clear seeing.\n\nHe was touching the race mind.\n\nHe was in contact with the race field.\n\nHis consciousness had been lifted to the level of that vast,\nall-pervading, but very subtle force field that comprised the race mind.\n\nThe knowledge was sudden agony in him, a pain that was needle sharp in\nthe region of his heart. The pain was strange because, while he could\nfeel it and knew it was happening in his body, it had no meaning to\nhim. He was detached from it, it hurt his body, but it did not hurt or\nharm him.\n\nHis body was alarmed by the pain, his breathing quickened, and a faint\ntrace of sweat appeared on his skin. But he was not alarmed. Even if\nhis body fell dead, he would not be concerned.\n\n\"What is it, Kurt?\" his ears heard Nedra say. She had detected his\nheavy breathing and she was alarmed. \"Are you about to faint again?\"\n\n\"No,\" his lips answered. His body laughed at the question. He heard the\nsound of his laughter as being both his and not his. His body knew it\nwas not going to faint. His laughter sounded hollow and out of place\nbut he did not care about that either.\n\nAhead, soldiers were lined up at the back end of the truck, waiting\ntheir turn in line.\n\n\"Your rank entitles you to priority,\" Nedra said hesitantly.\n\n\"In the place where I am now, my rank doesn't exist,\" he answered. \"I\njoin the end of the line, I take my turn.\" He was quite stubborn about\nthis.\n\nThe nurse looked pleased. He wondered if he had said something\nimportant. To him, what he had said seemed obvious. Behind him, West\nwas a silent shadow wrapped in an enigma. Even with his sudden new\nperception, his contact with a higher form of consciousness, he could\nnot perceive West clearly. Something about the craggy man defied\npenetration and analysis.\n\nThe men in the line ahead of him waited for their turn, shuffling\nforward each time the medics finished with their examination. There was\nno talk in the line. Not a man grumbled, not a man complained. Knowing\nmen, Zen knew that this was ominous.\n\nThese men had had it. They knew they had had it. In the face of that\nknowledge, nothing else mattered. Outwardly, they looked fit. Inwardly,\nsomething had happened to them. It seemed to Zen that he could see\nglows coming from their bodies. One was swaying. Zen seemed to glimpse\na blob of light moving suddenly upward from the man. The soldier fell.\nHe did not move a muscle after he hit.\n\nNedra started toward him. Zen shook his head. \"No use,\" he said.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nZen pointed skyward. \"He went that way.\"\n\nHer face whitened as she caught his meaning. \"I'll make sure.\"\n\nShe moved forward and inspected the fallen man, felt for a pulse, and\nfelt again, then got to her feet. As she returned, her back seemed to\nhave acquired a new sag.\n\nAn officer shouted from the truck, his voice gravel rough from tension.\nIn response, a stretcher-bearing detail moved forward. They inspected\nthe body of the fallen man, then lifted it and tossed it to the side of\nthe trail. One clipped a dog tag from it, then ran a counter over it.\nHe grunted to his companion, who tied a red tag on the dead man's wrist.\n\n\"Up that way, boys, you can find some more,\" Zen called to them,\njerking his thumb up the slope.\n\n\"We're not a burial detail,\" was the answer.\n\nThe soldiers in the line shuffled forward.\n\n\"Hey! It's gone!\" Zen said suddenly.\n\n\"What's gone?\"\n\n\"I'm back,\" Zen said.\n\n\"You never went anywhere,\" the nurse said.\n\n\"_It's gone_ and _I'm back_ both mean the same thing,\" he tried to\nexplain. \"The thing that is gone is my contact with the race field.\n_I'm back_ means that all of a sudden, I'm normal. I'm back here.\nI'm looking out of my eyes. I'm hearing with my ears. I don't know\neverything any longer.\"\n\nDaze was in him. Worse than the daze was the fact that even the memory\nof the experience was receding. Agony came with this recession. It\nseemed to him that this experience was the most important thing that\nhad ever happened to him.\n\nAnd it was going away. He watched it slide out of his memory. He felt\nlike running wildly to try and recapture it. Which way he would run\ndid not matter, just so he ran until he found it again. He fought the\nimpulse to run. The experience was not out there; it could not be found\nif he searched the whole world for it.\n\nIt was inside him.\n\nNedra looked at West and started to speak, but the craggy man motioned\nher to silence.\n\n\"Saul on the road to Damascus,\" Zen muttered. \"Something like this\nhappened to Saul on the road to Damascus.\"\n\n\"Kurt--\" Nedra said. Again the craggy man motioned her to silence. The\nfellow, rough mountaineer that he was, seemed to have some perception\nof the turmoil inside a fellow human being, and more than that, to have\nunderstanding and sympathy.\n\n\"I contacted the race mind,\" Zen said. \"For a minute, I was in touch\nwith the field of the race. But it's gone now,\" he added. Sadness and a\nfalling voice went with the last words.\n\n\"Step in front of the scope, soldier,\" a gravel voice growled behind\nhim. Turning, he saw that he was next in line. The lieutenant in charge\nof the first aid station had spoken to him. Seeing the eagle on Zen's\nhelmet he hastily apologized. \"I beg your pardon, sir.\"\n\n\"It's all right,\" Zen said. For an instant, as conflicting ideas\ncompeted for expression in him, he wondered who he was and why he was\nhere. Then he remembered what had happened. Well established reaction\npatterns took over and he stepped into position in front of the scope.\nInside the back end of the truck, a transformer hummed. Although\nhe could not feel it, he knew that a powerful stream of radiation\nwas passing through his body and that a count was being made of the\nradioactivity he had absorbed. The lieutenant studied his meters, then\nlooked up at Zen.\n\n\"You're all right, sir.\" He seemed puzzled.\n\n\"Not hot, eh?\"\n\n\"No, sir, you're not. Frankly, I don't understand it. Oh, you've got a\nlittle exposure, but nothing serious.\"\n\n\"I was in one of the old mines when the blast went off,\" Zen explained.\n\n\"Then that accounts for it. You were lucky as hell, sir. Next.\"\n\nCatching Nedra's arm, Zen swung her in front of the scope. The\nexperience with higher levels of consciousness had been forced out of\nhis mind, and he was all intelligence officer.\n\n\"But I'm all right! I mean, there's nothing wrong. Are you out of your\nmind again?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Zen said. \"But I've got the rank to make my decisions stick\nwhether I'm out of my mind or not. Lieutenant, check this woman. This\nis an order!\" Zen snapped out the words with all the precision and\nauthority of a drill-field sergeant training recruits.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the startled medical officer said.\n\nIgnoring Nedra's protests, Zen held her in place while the equipment\nwas put into operation. Behind them, West watched. The faintest trace\nof an approving smile showed on the craggy man's face.\n\nThe lieutenant looked up from his meters. \"She's all right too, sir.\"\n\n\"Sure of that?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm sure. This counter doesn't lie!\" The medical officer was\nindignant.\n\nSo was Nedra. The violet eyes shot sparks of anger at the colonel. Zen\nwas unimpressed. Deep inside, he was tremendously relieved. She had\ncome down alive! She was unharmed! This was enough to make him feel\ngood all over. He also knew what she was. No ordinary mortal could have\nremained in the hot zone for the length of time she had been there and\nemerged unharmed. He did not mind her anger. Instead he turned to West.\n\n\"You're next!\"\n\nHe did not know what response to expect from the craggy man. It might\nbe anything. To his surprise, West smiled.\n\n\"Glad to, colonel. I was hoping I would get tested, so I would know\nwhere I stood.\"\n\nWithout hesitation, West stepped in front of the scope. \"While I am\ncertain I did not receive enough exposure to do any damage, still it\nis best to follow your example and make certain.\" The deep voice was\nsuave, with tiny overtones of amusement in it somewhere.\n\nAgain the lieutenant studied his meters and again he looked up. Real\nperplexity was on his face. \"Three okays in a row. I didn't have a\nsingle okay up until now.\" His gaze went up the slope in the direction\nwhere the bomb had exploded.\n\n\"Does that mean I'm all right?\" West asked.\n\n\"Yes. Definitely all right,\" the lieutenant answered. \"And I don't\npretend to understand it.\"\n\n\"I was in a hole, too,\" West said. He seemed to be amused at some joke\nknown only to him.\n\nThe lieutenant brightened. \"Then I understand it.\"\n\n\"I wish I did,\" Zen said, to himself. There was no longer any doubt in\nhis mind that Nedra was one of the new people. As to West, the man was\nan enigma. Not knowing how long West had been exposed to the radiation,\nZen did not know what to make of his freedom from it. But there was\ncertainly something peculiar about him.\n\n\"Colonel, it was good to meet you.\" West was coming toward him with\noutstretched hand. Zen had the impression that the man's hand could\nturn into a veritable bear trap, if West chose. \"Perhaps we shall meet\nagain, sir.\" The words were a statement, not a question. An enigmatical\nsmile played over the craggy man's face.\n\n\"Who knows whether we shall meet again?\" Zen answered, shrugging.\n\"Generally, when people say goodbye these days, they mean goodbye\nforever.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Sadness showed on the craggy, lined face. \"It is too bad that\nthings have to be this way. Well, experience is a difficult school,\nbut _homo sapiens_ seems incapable of learning in any other.\"\n\n\"It is war,\" Zen said.\n\n\"I disagree with you there,\" West said. \"War is only a symptom of the\ndisease, it is only an expression of humanity. War itself is not at\nfault, but man. Nor can man really be regarded as being at fault, since\nwhat he is now going through is only a stage of growth.\"\n\nMomentarily the memory of the contact with the race mind flicked\nthrough Zen's consciousness. \"I know that,\" he said. Then he hesitated.\n\"Or I knew it once.\"\n\n\"Ah? When?\"\n\n\"Up the slope there, I knew it. But I have forgotten now what I knew.\"\nZen spoke slowly. He was trying hard to remember--or to forget--he\nwasn't sure which.\n\n\"Ah?\" West repeated. \"Goodday, sir. Nedra, I would like to speak with\nyou for a moment, before I leave. With your permission, of course,\nColonel Zen.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Zen said. He watched the nurse and the craggy man move up\nthe trail a few steps. They carried on a conversation in tones too low\nfor him to overhear, then parted. West went down to the bottom of the\nravine and crossed to the other side of the gulch, where he began to\nclimb the opposite slope, staying as far away from the radioactive zone\nas possible. Nedra returned to Zen beside the truck.\n\n\"Does he live back there?\" the intelligence agent asked.\n\n\"I really don't know,\" the nurse answered. \"I think he does, but I'm\nnot certain.\"\n\n\"It's rough country to live in.\"\n\n\"From what I have seen of him, he seems capable of living almost\nanywhere.\"\n\n\"Do you know him well?\"\n\nThe violet eyes regarded him thoughtfully. \"You are asking a great many\nquestions, sir.\"\n\n\"I'm going to ask more.\"\n\n\"My telephone number, no doubt. I'm sorry, but I don't have a\ntelephone.\" The violet eyes grew pensive. \"But if I did have a\ntelephone number, there is no one I would rather give it to than you.\"\n\nHe felt a warm glow at her words. The dream that he had once shared\nwith millions of other men, of a wife and kids, came into his mind\nagain, a yearning that was as old as history. If he had his free\nchoice, he would go with this dream.\n\nHe knew he did not have a free choice. Indeed, he doubted if he had any\nchoice at all. Nor had any other man. History had moved past the day\nwhen this dream could be realized. Fate was sweeping it into the dust\nheap of good things that were gone forever.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\"She is immune to radiation!\" Zen thought after Nedra had left to\nrejoin her unit. This in itself was of sufficient importance to attract\nand hold the interest of the top military and scientific minds. Perhaps\nsoldiers could also be immunized. Perhaps, by some impossible freak\nof chance, a way might be found for workers to return to abandoned\nfactories, to long-closed shops and forges. This might mean a new flow\nof goods and materials to troops that were desperately short of them\nand to a civilian population that, at a conservative estimate, was more\nthan half starved.\n\nA human being who had achieved immunity to radiation was important\nenough to command his complete attention. Also, the probability was\nvery great that she was one of the mysterious new people. Something\nelse about her interested him even more. He could not put his finger\non this something else but he suspected it had to do with the future,\nwith another world than the one he knew. Or with another universe.\nAgain the memory of his contact with the race mind flicked through his\nconsciousness.\n\nNow he knew what he was going to do insofar as Nedra was concerned. He\nhad a hunch what her next move would be. He would wait for her to make\nit.\n\nFinding a carbine was not difficult. On this trail, the weapons were\nto be had for picking them up. A dead man's ammunition pouches were\nfilled with cartridges. He took the pouches. Carrying the carbine, he\nslid down the bank toward the mountain stream that talked to itself at\nthe bottom of the canyon. The water was clear and cool but dead trout\nfloating in it warned him not to drink.\n\nSeeking a place from which he could watch the canyon, he moved upward.\nA dim trail was visible through the pines here.\n\n\"An old narrow-gauge railroad,\" he thought. The rails had been removed\nlong since, the ties had rotted away, and the roadbed itself was hardly\na trail through the growth of trees. He had barely settled himself in a\nspot from which to watch the ravine below, than a stone turned on the\nold roadbed.\n\nNedra was coming along the trail.\n\nHe let her pass without challenge. Sliding out of hiding, he followed\nher.\n\nTwisting and turning, the trail climbed slowly upward. When it reached\nthe edge of the timber, Zen caught a glimpse of a slide of yellow rock\nfar ahead, an old mine dump, which told him why the road had been\nconstructed in the first place. A ghost town was probably ahead.\n\nHe caught a glimpse of Nedra moving steadily ahead along the old road\nbed.\n\n\"If she doesn't know exactly where she is going, then I'm missing my\nguess,\" he thought, as he followed her. Elation was rising in him. She\nwas leading him straight to the hiding place of the new people.\n\nHere in these mountains a small group could remain in hiding forever.\nFood might eventually become a problem, but there was plenty of game in\nthe ranges: deer, elk, and bear, and some of the high valleys had been\nin cultivation before the war. A few hardy pioneers had always managed\nto find a living in this wilderness. If they could do it, so could this\nnew group.\n\nOf course, they would have to evade Cuso's roving patrols, raiding for\nfood, supplies and women. But that ought not to be too difficult. The\nghost town was in sight.\n\nSurrounding an old mine, a crusher, and a concentrator, the ghost town\nwas also in ruins. Unlike so many small cities, the ruin here had not\ncome from attack but from nature. The snows of winter had piled their\nburden on flimsy roofs, the seepage of spring had rotted the timbers,\nwith the result that many of the houses had simply collapsed. Weeds\ngrew in the doorways and scrub cedars had found roots in the streets.\n\nNedra was walking down the middle of what had once been the main\nstreet. Her stride was still certain and she seemed to know exactly\nwhere she was going.\n\nThe ragged man appeared in the door of the garage on her left. He spoke\nto the nurse, calling to her. She jumped at the sound of the voice,\nglanced at the man, then continued walking.\n\n\"Hey, wait a minute, cutie!\" the fellow shouted, loud enough for Zen to\nhear him. He lunged out of the doorway toward her. She turned to face\nhim.\n\nKurt Zen lifted the carbine, then dropped the muzzle. He not only had\ngreat confidence in Nedra's ability to protect herself, but he wanted\nto see what would happen.\n\nThe loop of rope, thrown with all the skill of a cowboy, came from the\nopposite side of the street. It settled over her shoulders, pinned her\narms to the side, and was instantly jerked tight. She was pulled to the\nground.\n\nThe man who had lunged out of the doorway of the garage leaped toward\nher. Throwing her on her stomach, face down, he jerked both hands\nbehind her back, then began to search her for a weapon.\n\nThe man who had thrown the rope came out of hiding to help his\ncompanion. He was short, with bow legs.\n\nTogether, they held the nurse down.\n\nZen raised the carbine to his shoulders. Although he had not previously\nfired this weapon, at this distance he could not miss.\n\nHer scream came to his ears.\n\n\"Colonel! Watch out!\"\n\nIn startled surprise, he slid the carbine from his shoulder. She had\nknown he was following her and that he was somewhere near! Thoughts\nlike startled hornets flicked through his consciousness. How had she\nknown he was following her? Why had she let him do it? More important,\nwhere was she leading him? Most important of all, why was she trying to\nsave him when her own life was in danger?\n\nEven if she had known he was following her, obviously she hadn't known\nthese men were here. She hadn't been coming to meet them. Then what\nwas her purpose in climbing to this old ghost town which lay just at\ntimberline on the edge of a mountain wilderness where Cuso was held at\nbay?\n\nThe first ruffian was standing erect. Zen brought the sights of the\ncarbine to bear on the center of his ragged coat.\n\n\"_Drop the gun!_\" a voice said behind him.\n\nEven more surprising than the command was the fact that he knew the\nvoice that had spoken. Or he thought he did. He let the carbine slide\nfrom his fingers.\n\n\"Now get 'em up.\"\n\nHe raised his hands. \"Hello, Jake,\" he called out.\n\nAn exclamation of surprise came from behind him. \"How the hell did you\nknow me?\"\n\n\"Recognized your voice,\" Zen answered. \"Can I turn around now?\"\n\n\"Sure. Sure. But what the hell are you doing up here?\"\n\nTurning, Zen saw the automatic rifle that covered him. The muzzle was\nwavering and the man who held it seemed confused. His face was covered\nwith a heavy growth of black whiskers and long hair peeped out from\nunder a battered helmet.\n\n\"Jake, it's really good to see you again.\" As if such things as\nautomatic rifles did not exist, Zen advanced with outstretched hand.\n\n\"Kurt Zen! I haven't seen you since--since--\"\n\n\"The night that Denver got it,\" Zen answered. Horror overwhelmed him\nas he remembered what had happened to the Mile-High city. A bomb had\nstruck from the sky that night and parts of Denver had gone much higher\nthan a mile.\n\n\"Yeah. That's it. Yeah. I thought you had got it that night, Kurt.\"\n\n\"I thought the same thing about you. What are you doing up here? And\nwhat--what happened to Marcia?\"\n\nThe instant Zen asked the question, he wished he had kept still. At the\nname something happened in the man's eyes. They began to change, going\nfrom comprehension to blankness, then coming back to understanding,\nthen losing that and going back to blankness. One instant the eyes\nlooked at Zen and the man remembered and liked this colonel. The next\ninstant, neither the eyes nor the mind behind them knew him. Zen was\nthen an alien, a stranger, to be distrusted and feared and possibly\ndestroyed. When Zen had known him in Denver, Jake had been a young\nairman. He and Marcia had been newly married and very much in love with\neach other.\n\n\"She--she--\" The voice was choked and tight with pain. \"The radiation\ngot her.\" For an instant, the memory held true. But there was too much\npain in the memory for this man to face it. The memory went away. Only\nthe pain remained. \"Marcia? Oh, she's fine. The next leave I get, we're\ngoing to have a second honeymoon.\" A glow appeared in the man's eyes.\n\"I can see her now, waiting for me. You must go with me, Kurt, and meet\nher again, the next leave I get.\"\n\nZen could have slugged him. He could have lifted the rifle out of\nJake's hands without protest. Instead, he did nothing. The man's pain\nwas much too real to hurt him further.\n\n\"What's going on here?\" a rough voice said.\n\nIt was the man in the ragged coat. Nedra and the man who had thrown the\nrope had disappeared. There was no indication where they had gone. This\nman's beard was thin and ragged. He had teeth like the fangs of a wolf\nbut the lights in his eyes did not shift. Instead, they remained fixed\nin constant hostility and suspicion. He had a sub-machine gun in his\nhands. The muzzle covered Zen.\n\n\"Oh, hello, Cal. I--\" Jake became confused. \"This is an old buddy of\nmine. I knew him down below ... I knew him when.... He's all right.\"\n\nCal's eyes said he did not believe a word he had heard. He looked Zen\nup and down. The muzzle of the gun did not waver from the intelligence\nagent's stomach. \"What are you doing up here?\"\n\n\"Maybe I got tired of the way things are down there,\" Zen answered. He\nwas not lying. He _was_ tired of the way things were going. So were\nuncounted millions of others.\n\nCal's eyes indicated he did not believe this. Zen could see him turning\nover different possibilities in his mind. He was inclined to use the\ngun. Dumping another body down the gorge would be an easy solution to\nthe problem of an intruder. \"How are things going down there?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Tough,\" Zen said, with conviction in his voice.\n\n\"What was the big boom over that way this morning?\"\n\n\"Cuso letting go with a blooper.\"\n\nInterest kindled in Cal's eyes. \"What was over there that was worth the\ncost of a blooper?\"\n\n\"A column of troops heading for Cuso's lair,\" Zen answered. \"He didn't\nlike it.\"\n\n\"I guess he wouldn't,\" Cal said. \"You with 'em?\"\n\n\"I was.\"\n\n\"Which way are they going now?\"\n\n\"Back down hill to die,\" Zen answered.\n\n\"Why didn't you go with 'em?\"\n\n\"I got tired,\" Zen said. He waved his hands in a gesture which was\nintended to explain how a man sometimes got tired and went off to rest\nfor a while. Cal grunted. This he understood.\n\n\"Are you hot?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nope. The medics checked me just before I took off.\"\n\n\"And are there others down there who feel like heading for the hills?\"\n\n\"Most of them are too damned near dead to make the effort. Why desert\nwhen you've had it?\"\n\n\"The blooper got a lot of 'em, eh?\"\n\n\"What the blast didn't get, the radioactivity did.\"\n\n\"Is the pass too hot for more troops to go through it?\"\n\n\"My guess is that way.\"\n\n\"Your guess? Don't you know?\"\n\n\"I didn't go up to see. I'm not that soft in the head.\"\n\n\"I see your point. Well, things must be really rough if colonels are\ndeserting. This is interesting.\" Cal fingered the gun but the muzzle no\nlonger pointed at Zen's stomach. \"What are you looking for up here?\"\n\n\"A place to hide out.\"\n\n\"For how long?\"\n\n\"Hell, how long can this go on?\" Zen answered. \"Even when it's over, I\ndon't want to go back down there and walk on skulls.\"\n\n\"Walk on skulls?\"\n\n\"That's all that will be left.\"\n\n\"You think the Asians are gonna win, then?\"\n\n\"I got a hunch there will be more skulls than anything else in Asia,\ntoo. No, I don't think they're going to win. I don't think anybody is\ngoing to win this one, except the people who have enough sense to hide.\"\n\nJake came out of his dreaming and put his hand on Cal's shoulder.\n\"Kurt's all right,\" he said.\n\nIt was obvious that Cal did not think very highly of this\nrecommendation.\n\n\"He's my pal,\" Jake continued. \"Let him join us. He'll make a good\nhand. Besides, me and him were buddies. And there was a girl--\" He\nstopped speaking and broke into dark musing as the memory of his wife\ncame again into his mind.\n\n\"Were you with this woman?\" Cal asked.\n\n\"He never was with this woman in his life!\" Jake screamed. \"She was\nmine, I tell you. Mine!\"\n\n\"Shut up, crazy head.\"\n\n\"Tell him, Kurt. Tell him Marcia was mine.\"\n\n\"Sure, Jake,\" Zen soothed. \"Everybody knew you and Marcia were that\nway. Cal and I were talking about another woman.\"\n\n\"Oh. That's different. But I don't want to hear either of you say that\nMarcia didn't belong to me.\"\n\nThe wolf-faced man looked as if he was about to use his gun on Jake.\n\"You stinking nut head, you stay out of this!\"\n\n\"All I was trying to do was to tell you Kurt was my pal.\"\n\n\"All right, you've told me. Now shut up.\" Cal turned to Zen again.\n\"About this woman, colonel? Were you together?\"\n\n\"No,\" Zen said.\n\n\"But she yelled out to you when me and Ed grabbed her.\"\n\n\"I heard her.\"\n\n\"You did?\" Cal's finger went around the trigger of the gun.\n\n\"Yeah. I was following her but I didn't know she knew it until she\nyelled.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Cal kept his finger on the trigger. \"Why were you following her?\"\n\n\"Hell, don't be stupid!\" Zen exploded. \"Why would any man follow a\nwoman like that?\"\n\nA trace of a grin went across the wolf face at this answer. Cal licked\nhis lips. This was an answer he understood. \"I don't blame you for\nthat. But why was she coming up here?\"\n\n\"That I don't know,\" Zen said. \"I don't think it made much difference\nanyhow. As soon as night came--\" He squinted at the sun.\n\n\"Do you think she might be a spy for Cuso heading for his camp to\nreport?\"\n\nZen felt his lower jaw sag. This was a thought that had not crossed\nhis mind. He knew only too well that the Asiatic had spies in as many\nplaces as he could get them. Cuso's survival depended in a large degree\non knowing how many troops were moving against him, how they were armed\nand over what passes they were coming.\n\n\"I see by your face that you had never thought of that,\" Cal said.\n\"Then what is she doing up here?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I realized she was ahead of me about a mile back. As to\nwhat she is doing, maybe she got tired of all that down there too, and\ndecided to come up here and live in the mountains?\"\n\n\"A woman in this wilderness?\"\n\n\"Some women have delusions that they can return to the primitive and\nmake a go of it.\"\n\n\"And maybe she had some other idea,\" Cal said.\n\nZen shrugged.\n\n\"Knowing this may be important to us,\" Cal said.\n\n\"Then we had better go ask her,\" Zen said. He was still shocked at the\nthought that Nedra might be a spy. Up until now, he had thought he was\nshockproof.\n\n\"You want to ask her?\" Cal said.\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Okay, you do the asking. I'll listen. And don't get any funny ideas.\"\nHis finger curled around the trigger of the gun. \"Remember, that if a\npatrol should come looking for a deserter, they would only be going to\nshoot him. I would be doing them a favor if I shot him in advance.\"\n\n\"I covered my tracks,\" Zen said. \"Nobody will be looking for me.\"\n\n\"How did you do it?\"\n\n\"I traded dog tags with a hunk of meat that had once been a GI. There\nwasn't enough left of him to tell for sure what he was. The burial\ndetail will clip my tags from his body and another colonel will be\nlisted as killed in action. The GI will be listed as missing.\"\n\n\"That was smart,\" Cal said, approvingly. For the first time, Zen\nthought he detected a note of admiration in the voice tones of the\nragged man.\n\nNedra was leaning against what had once been a work-bench in the\ngarage. Her helmet was off, her hair was ruffled, and her tunic had\nbeen almost torn from her body. A look of pure gratitude appeared on\nher face when Zen stepped through the doorway. A little cry of gladness\non her lips, she started toward him. Her eyes said she had never been\nas happy to see anybody in her life as she was to see this tall, lean\ncolonel.\n\nWith her was the little bow-legged man. He didn't look happy as Zen\nentered. \"Stand still,\" he snarled at the girl. \"Who the hell are you?\"\n\nAt his words, Nedra let her body sag back against the bench.\n\n\"Ed, this is Kurt,\" Cal said. \"He's joining us.\"\n\nThe look in Ed's eyes was pure venom. \"He may join us but he won't last\nlong. This woman is mine. I saw her first.\"\n\nZen wished fervently that he had the carbine back in his possession.\nSome vermin did not deserve to live. But Jake had that weapon. While he\ncould probably take the carbine away from Jake, the gun in Cal's hands\nwas very steady.\n\n\"She's not mine, you know,\" he said to Ed. \"So far as I am concerned,\nyou are welcome to her.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's different,\" Ed said, relieved.\n\nIf Zen's words relieved Ed, they had the opposite effect on Nedra. She\nopened her mouth to speak to him, then closed it in an apparent effort\nto bite off words that no lady should use.\n\nCal laughed. \"Ed is mighty touchy about his women. But don't let that\nstop you. Ask her what she is doing up here?\"\n\n\"None of your damned business, either of you,\" Nedra answered.\n\nZen shrugged and spread his hands in a gesture which said that he hoped\nCal would see how it was. Cal nodded. \"We'll find out later.\" His\nmanner indicated there was no question in his mind that he would find\nout what he wanted to know. \"Right now it's time for chow. Jake, get on\nthe job.\"\n\nJake turned and walked across the street to another house. Cal bringing\nup the rear, the others followed Jake. Ed took hold of Nedra's arm and\nescorted her across the street. Seeing this, Kurt Zen again wished that\nhe had a gun.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nThe meal was beef stew, which Jake prepared in a big pot on an old\nwood-burning range. They all ate around the kitchen table.\n\n\"There are lots of wild cattle up here,\" Cal explained. \"This used to\nbe good range country, you know. The remnants of the old beef herds are\nstill in existence, the ones that have learned how to dodge or whip the\nlions, that is.\"\n\nZen was busy watching Nedra and Ed. The little bantam was following\nevery move she made and was keeping as close to her as possible. He\ninsisted on sitting next to her at the table and he kept trying to\ntouch her at every opportunity.\n\nZen kept silent. Inwardly, he was greatly perturbed. Night was already\nthrowing shadows over the mountains. What would happen after darkness\nfell? Trying to keep such thoughts out of his mind, he found himself\nwondering if it would be possible for him to break the bantam's neck\nwith his bare hands. He decided he could do this, and that he would\nlike to do it, but that he would also like to stay alive afterward.\n\n\"Girls who go walking in the mountains have to take what happens to\nthem,\" he said.\n\nNedra ignored him. Ed glowered at him. Cal chuckled but continued\neating without speaking. Jake ate as if he did not know what he was\ndoing or where he was. Occasionally he looked toward the northwest\nand shook his fist in that direction. Zen knew that deep in his sick\nmind Jake was dreaming of what he would do to the Asians. Remembering\nMarcia, Zen did not blame him.\n\nEd tried to urge the nurse toward the dilapidated sofa in the room but\nshe eluded him and sat on an empty powder can, to the obvious disgust\nof the bantam. Two people could not sit on the same powder can. Jake\nrattled dishes in the kitchen, and fought imaginary Asians. Cal found\na seat in the corner, a position from which he could watch everyone in\nthe room. Off in the night an owl hooted.\n\nEd jumped at the sound, grabbed Nedra's hand, and tried to drag her\ntoward a ladder that led to some kind of an attic. Cal rose to his feet\nand moved toward the door.\n\n\"Stop it!\" Nedra said, to Ed.\n\n\"But, honey, you've got to get out of here,\" Ed urged. The bantam was\nat the edge of panic.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because that owl hoot was a signal. The guys who are coming will take\nyou away from me,\" Ed explained.\n\n\"Fine,\" Nedra said, her face brightening. \"There is justice in the\nworld after all. The good Lord does look after the poor working girl.\"\nHer voice indicated that she had begun to doubt this.\n\n\"But you don't know who these guys are,\" Ed protested.\n\n\"I don't care who they are. Satan himself would be welcome to me right\nnow.\" The words were addressed to Ed but she was looking at Kurt Zen as\nshe spoke. Zen did not attempt to answer her implied accusation.\n\n\"Damn it, I ain't going to let them take you away from me!\" Ed shouted.\nAgain he reached for the nurse's hand, to drag her toward the ladder.\nShe slugged him in the mouth.\n\nIn a fury, his fists clenched, the bantam started toward her. She\ndodged behind Zen.\n\n\"Lay off her, Ed,\" Cal ordered.\n\n\"But she belongs to me!\" Ed shouted. \"You know I saw her first. You\nsaid so yourself!\" The little man was beside himself with frustration\nand fury.\n\n\"If the lieutenant decides he wants her, you'll probably be the first\none dead,\" the ragged man commented. Then he shrugged. \"However, it's\nyour funeral, not mine. Only you probably won't get a funeral.\"\n\nAgain the owl hoot sounded, just outside the house this time. Cal\nopened the door. A lieutenant and four soldiers entered. Zen took one\nlook at the dirty uniforms and the slant eyes in dirty yellow faces and\nknew that these were Cuso's men. Coming into the room, the lieutenant\ntook command.\n\n\"Who is this?\" he demanded, nodding curtly toward Zen. He had not as\nyet noticed Nedra, who was still behind Kurt.\n\n\"A colonel who has seen the light of reason and has come over to our\nside,\" the ragged man promptly answered.\n\n\"Good. Cuso will be very glad to talk to him.\" The grin on the\nlieutenant's face left no doubt as to the meaning that lay back of\nhis words. Cuso's methods of extracting information from any person\ncareless enough to fall into his hands were well known.\n\n\"It will be a privilege to talk to the great leader of the Asian\nforces,\" Zen said. He felt sweat begin to appear under both arms. As\nsoon as the lieutenant had appeared, he had known that Cal was a spy\nsupplying information to Cuso.\n\n\"I'm sure Cuso will find it so,\" the lieutenant said. The grin vanished\nfrom his face as he caught a glimpse of Nedra behind the colonel. The\nrifle in his hands came up. \"Who is that?\" he demanded.\n\n\"A nurse who has also joined us,\" Cal hastily explained.\n\n\"What's she doing behind him?\"\n\n\"Ed was urging her to go upstairs with him and she hid behind this\nman,\" Cal explained. A tic had appeared in the right cheek of the\nragged man.\n\n\"Oh,\" the lieutenant said. His grin reappeared. \"Come out, plizz.\"\n\nAs Nedra stepped to Zen's side, the lieutenant's grin widened. He\nsucked in his breath. \"Yess. Oh but yess. Cuso will want to talk to\nher. Of that I am very sure.\"\n\nEd, his face as black as tar, started to protest. He took another look\nat the rifle in the Asian's hand and quickly changed his mind. The\nchattering of his teeth was audible all over the room.\n\n\"Why do you make that noise?\" the lieutenant said, looking at him.\n\n\"It--it's cold in here,\" Ed stuttered.\n\nAs the bantam spoke, Zen noticed that the temperature in the big room\nseemed to have dropped far more than seemed reasonable. Even the\nopening of the door, and the admission of the cool night air, was not\nenough to account for the sudden chill in the room.\n\nThis cold was different from anything Zen had ever experienced before.\nIt seemed to start at the center of the bones and work its way outward,\nreaching the skin surface last of all, where it produced a prickling\nsensation.\n\n\"I wish to eat,\" the lieutenant said.\n\n\"Of course,\" Cal instantly agreed. \"Jake! Food for the gentleman.\"\n\nJake, his eyes murky, was standing in the door leading to the kitchen.\nThe expression on his face indicated that he was about to launch\nhimself at the Asians.\n\n\"Get into that kitchen!\" Cal shouted.\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" Jake answered, moving out of sight. The banging of the\npots and pans that followed his departure seemed to have a sullen sound.\n\n\"That one is not right in the head,\" the Asian officer said.\n\n\"He's just dumb,\" Cal said, defensively.\n\nThe lieutenant pursed his lips. \"I forgot to mention that I left some\nof my men outside.\"\n\n\"Bring them in,\" Cal said promptly. \"They're probably hungry, too. And\ncold.\"\n\n\"I think I shall leave them where they are,\" the lieutenant said,\ndecisively. \"I left them on guard. They have set up a mounted machine\ngun at the edge of the street.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Cal said.\n\n\"The gun covers this house,\" the officer continued.\n\n\"Oh,\" Cal said. A sudden shiver passed through his body. He knew\nperfectly well what the lieutenant had just told him.\n\nIt seemed to Kurt Zen that the temperature of the room had dropped\nanother ten degrees. He was shivering, too, from the effect of that\nstrange cold that seemed to start at the marrow of the bones and spread\nitself outward.\n\nOf all those in the room, Nedra was the only one who did not seem to be\nsuffering from the effect of the chill. Her eyes were bright and her\nface had a warm glow. Zen watched her out of the corners of his eyes.\nDidn't she know that she had escaped from Ed only to fall into the\ntender mercies of Cuso's men?\n\n\"What has happened to you?\" he whispered to her.\n\nTurned toward him, her eyes had a glow that seemed to come from some\nlight that was suddenly burning inside them. The glow went from purple\nto violet, then to ultra-violet. After that, Zen could no longer see\nthe glow, but he suspected it had gone into higher ranges still. What\nwas more surprising was the fact that she was no longer frightened.\nConfidence had suddenly come to her, seemingly out of nowhere.\n\n\"What do you think has happened to me?\" Her voice had changed too. All\ntension had gone from it. The ragged edges of conflict had disappeared.\nShe seemed to be mistress of the situation, and to know it.\n\nJake came from the kitchen. \"I pick up vibrations,\" he announced, his\nvoice shrill.\n\n\"Get into the kitchen,\" Cal ordered, as the lieutenant raised his gun.\n\n\"But I'm only trying to tell you something.\"\n\n\"I'm telling you something, get back into that kitchen!\" Cal ordered.\n\nJake's gaze went murkily around the room but it was obvious that he\nwas giving more attention to some internal sight or sound than to the\npeople present.\n\n\"Git,\" Cal shouted.\n\nJake backed from the doorway.\n\nThe lieutenant lowered the muzzle of the gun. He barked an order to the\nmen with him, who arranged themselves with their backs to the wall. The\nofficer moved toward the fire, where he settled himself in a chair.\n\n\"You,\" he said. \"Take off my boots!\"\n\nHe was speaking to Zen. Kurt measured the distance to the lieutenant's\njaw. Out of the corners of his eyes, he noted the positions of the\nAsian soldiers.\n\n\"Odds are too great,\" he thought. \"Stay alive now. Maybe your turn will\ncome.\"\n\nAs he started to kneel, he bumped into Nedra, who was already on the\nfloor unbuckling the officer's boots.\n\n\"If you would rather do it, I would rather have you do it,\" the\nlieutenant said, smirking.\n\n\"It is a privilege, sir,\" the girl said. She pulled off the heavy boot\nand began to peel off the thick sock.\n\nThe probability that she had saved Kurt Zen's life was very great. He\nfelt a surge of anger at his own helplessness.\n\nThe feeling of cold at the marrow of his bones was appearing again.\nIt was stronger now. He noticed that Cal's hands were trembling. The\nteeth of one of the soldiers standing against the wall were chattering\naudibly. A second soldier looked as if he were about to go to sleep.\n\nZen discovered as he yawned that he was getting sleepy too. Along\nwith the cold creeping outward from his bones was a sensation of\nmental fogginess that was very close to sleep. The lieutenant, sitting\ndirectly in front of him, was nodding.\n\nEverybody was getting sleepy! Why? Had some subtle, odorless gas been\nintroduced into the room? What gas? Who had introduced it?\n\n_Crash!_\n\nThe rifle in the hands of the nodding soldier slid out of his grasp and\nstruck the floor, exploding as it hit. The slug ripped a hole through\nthe wall, passing within a foot of the lieutenant's head.\n\nThe Asian officer was instantly on his feet. He spun to face the sound.\n\nThe soldier who had dropped the rifle slid forward on the floor and lay\nthere, snoring.\n\nAs he saw what had happened, the face of the lieutenant settled into a\ngrim mask. He pressed the trigger of the automatic weapon he carried.\nThe gun burped violently. The sleeping soldier jerked as the heavy\nslugs crashed into his body. A little trickle of blood ran from his\nnose and collected in a small pool on the floor. The man died where he\nlay.\n\n\"_Yen thotem ke vos!_\" the lieutenant snarled. Two of the soldiers\nleft their position against the wall and lifted the body of their dead\ncomrade. The third remained motionless against the wall while they\ncarried the dead man out.\n\n\"If you go to sleep on me!\" the lieutenant said, to the third soldier.\nHis meaning was clear. The soldier shook his head. He understood what\nhis officer meant. Terror was in him. But something else was in him too.\n\nZen watched the soldier fight this something else. Slowly, he let the\nbutt of his rifle slide to the floor. He had enough intelligence and\nenough strength left not to drop the weapon. He set it against the\nwall. Then he sat down beside it.\n\nHe was making every possible effort to resist sleep, but in spite of\neverything he could do, he was losing this fight. Slowly, a fraction\nof an inch at a time, his head slid forward. Finally it dropped on his\narms that were folded across his knees. He began snoring.\n\nThe face of the lieutenant was that of a frightened tiger from the\ndepths of the Assam jungles. The muzzle of the gun swung to cover the\nsleeping soldier. A split second passed during which this Asian was on\nthe verge of joining his ancestors.\n\nRealizing finally that this man could not be held accountable for his\ninability to stay awake, the lieutenant held his fire. He jerked up\nhis head to stare around the room. His face was that of a tiger who\nsuspects it has been caught in a trap but is not yet certain of the\nnature of the device it has been snared in. His eyes came to focus on\nCal.\n\n\"I--I swear--\" The ragged man's voice was a thick mutter that did not\nconvey much meaning. Cal was sleepy too!\n\n\"What have you done here?\"\n\n\"I--nothing. I have done nothing--and I know nothing--I am as surprised\nas you.\"\n\n\"You're a liar!\"\n\n\"No. Telling truth--\" Cal's head had sagged downward toward his chest\nand his voice was getting thicker and more groggy. With an effort of\nwill, he snapped his head up. \"I--don't know. Something.... Yes! Never\nheard of anything like it before.... Hell, lieutenant, it's getting me\ntoo!\"\n\nCal's head sagged forward on his chest. \"So sleepy ... so tired ...\ngotta take a nap....\" His knees sagging, Cal lay down on the floor. He\ncuddled his head on one arm.\n\nThe lieutenant spoke, but the grunt that came from his lips was not a\ngrowl. Soon, he, too, was fast asleep.\n\nKurt and Nedra were the only two people who were able to remain\nawake. The nurse was making desperate efforts to resist this strange\nsleepiness. Swaying on her feet, she turned toward Zen. He caught her\nin his arms.\n\n\"What's happening?\" She sounded like a tired little girl.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Zen answered.\n\n\"Why is everybody going to sleep? Is it bedtime?\"\n\n\"It must be.\"\n\n\"Are you sleepy, too?\" Her voice was a tired whisper.\n\n\"I never was so sleepy before in my life,\" Kurt answered.\n\n\"Then why don't we--just take a little nap?\" Nedra murmured. The way\nshe spoke, this was the most reasonable suggestion that had ever been\noffered. Sagging into his arms, she would have fallen if he had not\ncaught her. Gently, he eased her to the floor. Her chest rose and fell\nin a regular rhythm.\n\nIf there was one thing Kurt wanted to do it was to lie down on the\nfloor and go to sleep, too. Every organ in his body, every cell, every\nmolecule seemed to cry out that sleep was needed. He felt his knees\nbegin to sag, his head to droop. It seemed to him that all strength was\ngoing out of his body, that his muscles could no longer hold him erect.\n\n\"Stay awake!\" someone snarled at him. He was startled to realize it was\nhis own voice that had spoken the words. He was even more startled by\nthe fury in the tones.\n\nHis knees continued to sag. In spite of everything he could do to\nprevent it, his body continued on its way to the floor. The muscles in\nhis long legs seemed to have turned into rubber. He went down to his\nknees but caught himself on his hands.\n\nThe impulse to continue the rest of the way to the floor was like a\ntidal wave. Every thought in his mind was on the desirability of sleep.\nHow wonderful it would be to take a nap, to rest, to dream, to wake no\nmore.\n\nWith a strength that was born of desperation, he fought this impulse. A\nbattle began inside his body, a conflict that seemed to involve every\nbrain cell and every nerve ending, and finally every muscle group. Pain\ncame up as muscle fought muscle, as nerve cell fought nerve cell, as\none part of the brain fought another part. He tried to force his body\nto rise to its feet again.\n\nAll he could do was grunt.\n\n\"Stand up!\" he snarled at himself.\n\nHis body quivered and twisted but did not move. He repeated the command\nto himself. The effect was to increase the conflict. And the pain.\nHe had never known such agony. It rolled through him like a series of\ntidal waves.\n\n_Click!_\n\nWhat happened took place so suddenly that it seemed to occur outside of\ntime.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nInstantly, as the click sounded, he was outside his body, looking down\nat it. The pain was gone. The conflicting muscle pulls were gone. Or he\nwas no longer aware of them. He understood that the latter was the true\nexplanation.\n\n\"Stand up,\" he said, to his body.\n\nHis body obeyed this order. It rose from its hands and knees and stood\nupon its feet.\n\nThis fact did not surprise Kurt Zen. He had known it would happen. This\nwas the way things were. The essence of him, the consciousness that was\nabove the body, was never surprised.\n\n\"Stop trembling,\" he said, silently, to his body.\n\nInstantly the tremors vanished. The body knew its master.\n\nKurt Zen also knew that he now had a choice. He could go back into that\nbody. Or he could go--elsewhere. But he knew where he was needed most.\n\n_Click!_\n\nThe way he went back into his body was like turning a switch. One\ninstant, he was inside, looking through his eyes, hearing through his\nears.\n\nHe moved quickly, snatching the gun from the lieutenant's grasp.\nAnother instant and he had the weapons of the soldiers. He flung these\ninto the corner. Then he grabbed Cal's gun from the floor where the\nragged man had dropped it.\n\nAt this point, he saw that Nedra was sitting up and was watching him.\nThe expression on her face was that of a sleepy small girl awakening in\nthe morning. Only this small girl did not quite succeed in looking as\nif she had been asleep. Her eyes were too wide open and she looked much\ntoo alert.\n\n\"Hello,\" Zen said. \"So you decided to call off the sham.\" The thought\npopped into his mind and the words out of his mouth before he could\nstop them.\n\n\"Did you know?\" she gasped.\n\n\"Of course I did,\" Zen stoutly insisted. \"When you went to sleep, I\nknew it was a trick designed to lure me by suggestion into the belief\nthat I was sleepy, too.\"\n\n\"Then why did you let me do it?\"\n\n\"I wanted to see how far you would go,\" he answered. \"Come on. Let's\nget out of here.\"\n\n\"What about them? Are they shamming too?\" She pointed to the bodies on\nthe floor.\n\n\"They're up there, watching,\" he said, gesturing toward the ceiling. He\nlaughed.\n\nOwlishly, she stared at him. \"I do believe you are out of your mind,\ncolonel.\"\n\n\"It helps,\" he said. \"Come on. Let's make tracks.\"\n\n\"That's a splendid idea, colonel. Except for one thing.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\nShe pointed to the sleeping lieutenant. \"He said he had left some men\nwith a machine gun.\"\n\n\"Damn! I had forgotten that. However, that is a problem that can be\nsolved.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"This way.\" He moved to the heavy machine gun mounted at the window so\nthat its muzzle covered the street. He had his finger on the trigger\nand was searching the street when he realized that she was pulling at\nhis arm and speaking to him. \"What?\" he said.\n\n\"No,\" she answered. Her voice was very firm.\n\n\"Are you out of your mind?\" he demanded.\n\n\"We don't have to shoot them,\" she replied.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because they are already taken care of.\"\n\n\"Eh? How do you know?\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Then you also know how these men here were put to sleep?\" His voice\nhad the sound of steel on stone.\n\nShe faced him without fear. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"You did it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then who did?\"\n\n\"Come and I will show you.\"\n\n\"Hunh!\" Zen grunted. He made up his mind without hesitation. Starting\ntoward the back door, he discovered that she was going out the front.\n\"But that door is probably covered,\" he protested.\n\nShe opened it without answering his protest. Going through it, Zen\nthought the night outside was far colder than it had any right to be.\nNedra moved without hesitation. Fifty yards away from the house a\nmachine gun mounted on a tripod was set up in the street. Two men were\nlying on the ground beside it. In the quiet night, Zen could hear them\nsnoring.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"I have to admit you knew what you were talking\nabout. But if you didn't do this, who did?\"\n\n\"Just a minute and you will have an answer to your question,\" she\nreplied.\n\nA block beyond the machine gun, a tall figure lounged in the doorway of\na ruined building.\n\n\"Hi, kids,\" he said.\n\nAt the first sound of the deep bass voice Zen knew that this was West.\nThe craggy man nodded to him. West did not seem in the least surprised\nto see Zen.\n\n\"What the hell are you doing here?\" Zen said.\n\n\"I had business here,\" West said, in a tone of voice that made Zen feel\nlike an errant schoolboy being reproved by a kind, but firm, teacher.\n\n\"Did you make those people go to sleep?\" Zen continued.\n\n\"Has somebody been sleeping?\" West answered. \"Hmm.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Zen said.\n\n\"Did you run into some difficulty?\" West asked Nedra. He ignored Zen.\n\n\"Sort of,\" the girl answered. \"The fact is, I almost got raped. I was\nafraid I wasn't going to reach you.\"\n\n\"I was busy and didn't pick you up at first,\" the craggy man said. His\nvoice was a rumble of sound in the darkness. He did not seem surprised\nwhen she mentioned what had almost happened. \"The colonel followed you,\neh?\"\n\n\"Yes. I told you he would.\"\n\n\"How did you know I would follow you?\" Zen demanded. With the\nlieutenant's gun in his hands, he felt very secure.\n\n\"Any woman would know that,\" Nedra answered. Her laugh tinkled in the\ndarkness. Finding Zen's arm, she squeezed it. \"He is one of the new\npeople,\" she said, to West.\n\nZen wished he could have sunk into the ground. The craggy man did not\nseem surprised. \"Hmm,\" he said again. \"That is nice.\" Reserve seemed to\nhave appeared in the bass tones.\n\n\"Let's get inside,\" Nedra suggested. \"It's been a hard day and I'm so\ntired I feel as if I'm walking on my leg bones instead of my feet.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" West said, without moving.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Nedra asked. Alarm suddenly appeared in her voice.\n\"Don't you believe he is actually one of us? I told you he was.\"\n\n\"I did not say I disbelieved you. But what if you are mistaken?\"\n\n\"I can't be mistaken. He followed me, didn't he? That proves I'm right.\"\n\n\"Men have been following women since Bhumi started turning,\" West\nreplied. \"What if you are wrong?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the nurse said, a falling inflection in her voice.\n\n\"In that case, who would shoot him?\" West continued.\n\n\"Oh,\" the nurse said. Her voice fell lower still.\n\n\"You know the rules. We cannot have anyone except true mutants.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"In case someone brings in a person who is not a true mutant, it is the\nduty of the person who introduced the interloper to dispose of him.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Nedra said.\n\n\"In this case, it would be up to you to shoot the colonel,\" West\ncontinued. \"Could you do it?\"\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't want to--\" The reluctance in her voice was very\nstrong. \"But I would do it.\"\n\n\"I hope I don't have to hold you to your promise,\" West said. \"But in\nthat case, come on, both of you. That is, if the colonel wishes.\"\n\n\"You can't kid me,\" Zen said. \"Neither of you are capable of shooting\nanybody.\" He spoke fearlessly but he felt a trace of doubt. Not one of\nthe new people had ever betrayed their group. This indicated something.\n\"Lead on. I'm following.\"\n\nNedra found Zen's arm.\n\n\"Would you cry, after you had shot me?\" Zen asked.\n\n\"Y--yes.\"\n\n\"But that wouldn't keep you from shooting me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, that would be nice, anyhow, though I do not see what good it\nwould do me.\"\n\n\"You sound as if you wouldn't care,\" the girl said.\n\n\"There are times when I am sure death would be a blessed relief.\"\nZen meant every word he said. \"That life down there,\" he jerked his\nthumb to indicate the lower ranges and the plains so far below, \"gets\ntiresome. That's an understatement, if I ever made one.\"\n\nThe nurse was silent. \"Yes, I understand,\" she said at last. \"It was\nthat way with me, once.\"\n\n\"How much farther before we get to--Hell, where are we going anyhow?\"\nZen blurted out.\n\n\"To the center here,\" Nedra answered.\n\n\"Um,\" Zen said. He wanted to say something else but he decided he'd\nbetter be careful.\n\nWest led them into an old tunnel which bored straight into the side of\nthe mountain.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\n\"Is the center in here?\" Zen asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" Nedra answered.\n\n\"But why haven't Cal and his buddies found it?\"\n\n\"They don't even know we exist,\" Nedra explained. \"And if they did, for\nsome reason they wouldn't like to come into the tunnels.\"\n\n\"In effect, the tunnel is wired,\" West said.\n\n\"Do you mean they would get a jolt of high voltage electricity if they\nventured in here?\"\n\n\"Nothing as crude as that,\" the craggy man replied. \"However, at two\nplaces, high frequency generators are built into the walls and hidden\nin such a manner that a person entering the tunnel is saturated with\ntheir radiations, which trigger the adrenals in his body. The result of\nthis is that he suddenly feels very much afraid.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" Zen said, startled. \"A fear generator?\"\n\n\"In effect, it is that.\"\n\n\"But that would be a very powerful weapon.\"\n\n\"Yes, it would,\" the craggy man said, his voice dry.\n\n\"If you could generate such radiations in sufficient intensity and\ncover a large enough area with them, you could panic a division,\nperhaps even an army.\" Excitement was in Zen's voice. He knew that\nthe scientists were desperately searching for a new weapon that might\npossibly end the war. Perhaps here was such a weapon.\n\n\"It might work that way,\" West admitted.\n\n\"Does the government know about this?\"\n\n\"I believe not.\"\n\n\"Who invented it?\"\n\n\"I believe Jal Jonner is generally credited with being the inventor,\"\nWest said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Zen answered, and was silent. Jonner's name had become a legend\nof the days when there were giants in the Earth, mighty men whose\nthinking had gone beyond the concept of nations to envision one race,\nbeyond the creeds of churches to see one faith, and beyond the dogma of\neconomics to state that as long as one hungry man existed on the face\nof the earth, no man with a full dinner in front of him was free to eat\nhis meal in peace and safety. Jonner's thinking had also gone beyond\none planet to see one solar system--and beyond that, one universe.\n\n\"Here is the first generator,\" West said. He flicked the beam of his\nflashlight against the walls. \"Of course, there isn't anything to see.\nBut you may feel something.\"\n\nAs the intelligence agent moved forward, a sudden surge of fear came\nboiling up from his middle. It was a wild emotion and it carried with\nit a blasting sense of great peril, of death. Instantly, thoughts\nflashed through his mind of the first time he had ever been under shell\nfire, the scream of artillery shells, the blasts of the explosions, the\nshaking of the earth.\n\nAs the surge of fear shot upward from his middle, he felt his body jerk\nand start to tremble. \"Run!\" a voice screamed inside him. \"Get away\nfrom here! Run for your life!\"\n\nHe caught the impulse to flee, held it in check. It was like trying to\nhold back a tidal wave. \"This is an interesting effect,\" he said. \"Does\nthe generator have the same effect on all people?\"\n\nWest grunted and walked ahead without answering the question. Zen\nthought the grunt held an approving tone. Nedra squeezed his arm but\nsaid nothing.\n\nThe craggy man did not point out the second generator, but Zen felt\nthe radiations hit him, stronger than before. He was mentally prepared\nthis time, but his body wasn't. He felt his muscles tie themselves\ninto knots. The impulse to run was a screaming ululation of mad wolf\nintensity pouring into his consciousness.\n\nZen kept on walking. As abruptly as he had entered it, he was out of\nthe radiation zone. Up ahead of him, West did not grunt or change his\npace. Except for Nedra's fingers digging into his arm, Zen had no\nindication that either felt the radiation. What kind of people were\nthey, to be able to walk through hell and be uninfluenced by it? Zen\nwondered as he wiped sweat off his forehead.\n\nAhead, West grunted and played his light on the side wall. The craggy\nman grunted again. On the right, the side wall began to swing back\nas a door opened there. From the tunnel the wall looked like solid\nstone, but as the door opened, the back was seen to be made of metal. A\nlighted tunnel leading to a large gallery lay beyond.\n\n\"Enter,\" West said.\n\n\"Who did all of this?\" Zen inquired.\n\n\"Jal Jonner took over the title to this old mine. He and his men sealed\noff the deeper tunnels, enlarged them, provided an air supply, built\nlaboratories and living quarters, and made a comfortable hidden world\nhere.\"\n\nZen felt he should have known better than to ask. According to these\npeople, Jal Jonner had done everything, except lay the foundations of\nthe world. \"I see,\" the colonel said. \"He did all of this before he\ndied.\" None of the reports he had read had mentioned this activity, or\nhad even hinted at it, but he did not see fit to mention this.\n\n\"No,\" West denied.\n\n\"But you just said--\"\n\n\"He did it after he died,\" the craggy man explained.\n\n\"Huh?\" Zen said. \"Pardon me, but I did not seem to hear you clearly. I\nthought you said he did this after he died.\"\n\n\"That's what I said. That's what he did.\" The craggy man's voice was\ncalm.\n\n\"I--uh--\" Zen hastily changed his mind about the words he was going to\nuse. Secretly he was wondering if West was hopelessly insane. How could\na dead man build anything? \"You understand that I am not too familiar\nwith what actually happened. Sorry and all that but I simply haven't\nhad to learn.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" West said. \"You don't need to apologize. You will learn\nhere.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Zen said. He doubted if he felt better because his explanation\nhad been accepted. West's last words had an ominous ring to them.\n\n\"Your lack of familiarity with Jonner's history is very obvious,\" West\ncontinued.\n\n\"But if he was dead--\"\n\n\"He didn't die,\" West patiently explained. \"He was buried. A handsome\nmonument was erected over his grave. But he wasn't in the grave.\"\n\n\"Son-of-a-gun!\" Zen said. \"Why all the fol-de-rol?\"\n\n\"To deceive curious intelligence agents,\" West said, with no humor in\nhis voice.\n\nZen ignored the ironic threat. He was inside, this was what mattered.\nAlso the idea of one of the world's foremost scientists--and Jonner\nhad been exactly that--hiding himself away here where he could work\nundisturbed with others who shared his dream, intrigued him. Or had\nthat dream been a grim prognostication of the way things were to be on\nthe surface of the third planet out from the sun? Had the work here\nbeen an effort to escape that future? Was this underground cavern\nreally a modern Ark, dug into the heart of a mountain so that at least\na few humans might escape the deluge by fire?\n\nHad a modern Noah appeared and not been recognized?\n\nThe thought shocked Kurt Zen. Somewhere he had read a prediction that\nEarth would be destroyed by fire. Here was evidence that possibly at\nleast one human being had taken that prediction seriously enough to\nbuild a bomb-and-radiation-proof shelter!\n\n\"You seem to be thinking seriously,\" West observed.\n\n\"Perhaps for the first time in my life, I am doing exactly that. My\nbrain seems to be trying to spin.\"\n\n\"Ah? Are you surprised at what you find here?\"\n\n\"No. That is, not much. Mostly, I'm pleased.\"\n\n\"Good.\" West seemed satisfied. \"Here comes John to greet us.\"\n\nThe craggy man's face lit up as a tall youth emerged from an adjoining\ntunnel and came forward to meet them. His greeting to West had respect\nin it, he merely glanced at Zen, but it was the nurse who commanded and\nheld his interest.\n\n\"Nedra! You're back!\"\n\n\"Of course I'm back, John.\" As if this were the most natural thing\nto do, Nedra allowed herself to be taken in John's arms. West smiled\nbenevolently at the two. Zen carefully looked in the other direction.\n\n\"This is Colonel Kurt Zen, John,\" West said, when the two had finished\nkissing.\n\nThe tall youth extended his hand and said he was glad to meet Kurt. His\nface was brown, his cheeks were lean and slightly hollow, but his eyes\nwere clear and his grip was firm without being bone-crushing.\n\n\"I imagine Kurt is rather tired,\" West said. \"If you would find\nquarters for him, John--\"\n\n\"Glad to do it,\" the tall youth said. \"Come with me, Kurt.\"\n\nZen nodded goodnight to Nedra and to West and followed John away. He\nwas tired down to the bottom of his thick-soled boots. Fatigue lay in\nlayers through his muscles and along his nerve trunks. He knew he was\nkeeping himself from collapsing only by an effort of will.\n\n\"I'll give you my room,\" John said.\n\n\"I couldn't think of depriving you of your quarters, old fellow,\" Zen\nprotested.\n\n\"It's no deprivation. Besides, I'll be with Nedra.\"\n\n\"Um,\" Zen said. The jealousy he felt almost made him forget how tired\nhe was.\n\nThe room was as bare as the cell of a monk. The bed was a double decker\nwith the top deck covered with books. It was hand-made, of rough pine\nposts, and the springs were cords. There was no mattress. And no\npillow. A reading lamp was at the head.\n\n\"Hope you're comfortable here,\" the tall youth said. \"Is there anything\nI can get for you?\"\n\n\"Nothing. But you might show me the little boy's room.\"\n\n\"Are you still on that level?\" The tall youth seemed genuinely\nsurprised.\n\n\"Yes,\" Zen said. Then, as the implications back of the question caught\nhim, \"Aren't you on the same level? I mean, don't you go?\"\n\n\"Well, yes,\" John answered. Embarrassment reddened his face. \"But\nyou're older than I am, and I thought perhaps you--\" His voice trailed\noff into silence as his embarrassment grew.\n\n\"You thought what?\" Zen continued.\n\n\"Well, that--\" The youth became flustered, then seemed to become\nirritated with himself for being flustered, then for being irritated.\nZen watched the emotional reaction build higher and higher. He could\nsee no possible importance in the emotional response of the tall kid\nexcept that the kid had intimated that he might be spending the night\nwith Nedra. Would people who didn't use toilets spend nights together?\nIf they did, what would they do? Talk about the beauties of flowers and\nread poetry to each other? Zen sniffed silently to himself, to show his\ncontempt for such antics.\n\n\"I'll show you where to go,\" John said, suddenly.\n\nZen followed the tall youth out of the room and into a short tunnel\nwhich led to a large gallery. Here the old-time miners had found a\nsizeable body of ore. The gallery had been cleared of refuse and a\nnumber of small rooms had been dug into the walls, the whole place\nbeing illumined by a fluorescent paint that covered the walls. The\ncolor of the light was a misty blue and the whole big gallery seemed\nto float in this light, creating an effect that was breath-takingly\nbeautiful.\n\nIn the first room they passed a naked young woman who was going through\ngymnastic exercises in time to slow music. At the sight of her lithe,\nbrown body bending and swaying in time to slow music, Zen whistled\nappreciatively through his teeth. She was almost enough to make him\nforget Nedra.\n\nIn another room a fat youth was reading a book. He was lying flat on\nthe floor. In a third, a skinny young man with skin the color of old\nivory was sitting cross-legged before a shrine. His features were as\nimmobile as a statue of Buddha. The same faint smile seemed painted on\nhis face.\n\nIn another room a beautiful young woman was undressing preparatory to\nretiring. She hadn't bothered to close the door.\n\n\"What the hell is this, a glorified whorehouse?\" Zen blurted out.\n\n\"A _whore house_? What's that?\" John asked.\n\nHis manner made Zen feel like apologizing for having used such words in\nhis presence. \"Never mind. I withdraw the question. Who keeps tab on\nwhere the boys and the girls spend the night?\"\n\n\"No one,\" John answered, astonished. \"Is somebody supposed to?\" He was\nstartled at the idea. \"Oh, you are concerned about sex. You are also\nnew here. Sex is no problem here, as you will learn.\"\n\n\"No problem? Don't you engage in it?\"\n\n\"We have other, and more important things, to do,\" John answered. His\nwords were lofty but his tone was kind.\n\nZen heard the words but he filed mental reservations about accepting\ntheir meaning. Silently he wondered if these kids had all their\nmarbles. Apparently they had not even learned about the birds and the\nbees.\n\n\"Anything else I can tell you?\" John asked.\n\n\"You've already told me too much,\" Zen answered. \"I'm afraid to ask you\nany more questions.\"\n\nThe toilet had no flush plumbing. _After use, press the button_, a sign\nabove it said. Zen did just that. No sound of running water followed\nbut the colonel had the dim impression that intensely bright light had\nflared for a moment. He did not have the courage to look and see what\nhad happened.\n\nIn some ways, this toilet which disposed of its contents in a flash of\nlight was more significant and possibly more productive of concern than\nCuso's blooper or Cuso's lieutenant had been. If the new people found\nit convenient to disintegrate their sewage, rather than dispose of it\nby the conventional method, what else could they do?\n\nZen shook his head to indicate to himself how amazed he was. John\nthought he wanted more information and started to ask a question, which\nthe colonel hastily interrupted. \"Don't tell me any more. There are\nlimits to what my liver and lights will stand.\"\n\n\"What have your liver and lights to do with this?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all. That was only a figure of speech.\"\n\nAs they returned through the gallery, he saw that the bronze girl was\nstill going through her rhythmic dance in time to the slow music. The\nsight of that perfectly formed nude body slowly swaying in the small\nroom sent such a surge of excitement through Kurt Zen that he hastily\nturned his eyes away. If he was going to live in this place very long,\nthey would have to make some new rules. How could any human being stay\nin bed alone when that beautiful bronze creature was going through her\nswaying dance?\n\n\"What is she doing, learning to be a strip-tease dancer?\" he asked.\n\n\"Perfect muscular control. This is one of the exercises we all learn,\"\nJohn answered. \"What's a strip-tease dancer?\"\n\n\"Nothing you ever heard of,\" Zen answered. \"But while she is developing\nher muscular control, what is she doing to the endocrinal system of\nevery male in the place?\"\n\n\"Not a thing,\" John said, astonished again.\n\nZen had grave doubts that the tall youth knew what he was talking about.\n\nJohn selected a single book from the top of the double-decker bed, and\nanxiously inquired if there was anything more he could do to make the\ncolonel comfortable for the night. Upon being told there was not, he\ndeparted with the book. Zen thought of the book benignly. If the tall\nyouth was going to spend the night with Nedra, at least there would be\na book between them.\n\nHe slid off his heavy pack and set the lieutenant's sub-machine gun\nwhere he could reach it readily. His counter told him there was no\nradioactivity present.\n\nBooks were in a niche in the stone wall behind the bed. The author of\none caught his eye: Jal Jonner.\n\nThe name was enough to hold his attention. Jonner was known to have\nwritten books, but few had survived. Even the Library of Congress did\nnot have them, but there was no Library of Congress in any sense of the\nword any more. When Washington had left the planet, the Library had\ngone with it.\n\nGlancing at the introduction, Zen forgot all about his fatigue and\nwhere he was. One glance at the words and he knew he was in contact\nwith the living waters of life itself.\n\n\n                            _INTRODUCTION_\n\n     _In the beginning, I am going to make an inaccurate statement. I\n     am going to say that the reading of this book may open a new life\n     for you. Now let me explain why this statement is inaccurate._\n\n     _In the first place, it is inaccurate because this is not the\n     start of your life. That took place millions of years ago--more\n     millions of years than I care to mention here._\n\n     _So your life did not start with the reading of these words.--Now\n     as to the use of the word \"new.\" This, also is inaccurate. To you,\n     the ideas expressed here may seem novel and new. But they are not\n     new in the sense that they have just been created, or even that I\n     have created them. They were implicit in the formation of the\n     first molecule of protoplasm that came into existence on this\n     planet. They are, therefore, as old as life._\n\n     _The pattern which you may, or may not follow, was laid down in\n     the first molecule of protoplasm which appeared on this planet,\n     as the Law of Growth._\n\n     _However, there is no law which requires that one species on this\n     planet, or even all combined species, the total life spectrum\n     here, shall survive to grow to full stature. The possibility of\n     growth is implicit in every form of life; it is latent, and\n     capable of development, in every species. However, the species\n     that fails to take advantage of the opportunity thus offered, if\n     it fails to develop its potential, must inevitably give earth room\n     to the species which is developing. In their day, the dinosaurs\n     ruled the planet. They had their chance, but they failed to\n     develop._\n\n     _Where, now, are the dinosaurs?_\n\n     _The Law is--Grow or Die. THIS LAW ALSO APPLIES TO MAN._\n\n     _This book may be regarded as a primer, a starting point of your\n     adventure into the coming development of man. It is the first text\n     book that you will receive. It is the beginning of the way._\n\n     _How much progress you make upon the way, how well you master the\n     law of growth, is, in large measure, up to you. You will receive\n     assistance, sometimes without your knowledge, but it will not be\n     the kind of assistance that will retard or weaken your\n     development. The new people will not be helped--too much! Strength\n     is required of them and strength is only achieved by overcoming\n     obstacles._\n\n     _The next upward step that the race takes--if it survives its own\n     self-destructive impulses--will be of such a nature as to require\n     the utmost in strength and courage from those who participate in\n     it._\n\n     _This step, it is fair to state, is in the direction of a higher\n     development of consciousness._\n\n     _Good luck--and God go with you._\n\n    _Jal Jonner_\n    _The Big Sur_\n    _July 1971_\n\nWritten in 1971, the book was now 49 years old, Zen decided after a\nrapid calculation. The war had started in 2009. The time was now 2020.\n\nEagerly, he turned to the first chapter. It seemed to him that his life\nwas just beginning, that everything that had ever happened to him and\nall that he had ever done was in preparation for this moment, when life\nwould begin.\n\nAfter reading two pages, he reached the conclusion that, if this was\na primer, the text that was to follow must be difficult indeed. The\nbook started with mathematics that was twice as difficult as calculus.\nTrying to concentrate, he found the symbols blurring before his eyes.\nThen, as fatigue finally overwhelmed him, the whole page blurred and\nwas gone. He was asleep.\n\nBut he wasn't really asleep. The body slept. But he was not the body.\nHe was the consciousness that animated the body. This never slept.\n\nHe awakened at the touch of a hand on his shoulder.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nComing back to conscious awareness, Kurt Zen simultaneously realized\nthat something which he had been experiencing, and which had been very\nimportant, faded out of his memory like a gray ghost sliding silently\naway into a pearl-colored mist.\n\nNedra was shaking him by the shoulder and was smiling down at him.\n\"Wake up, sleepy head. You've been snoozing for eighteen hours. That\nought to be enough even for a growing boy like you.\"\n\nHer face was radiant and alive. She looked as if she had just stepped\nout of a cold shower and had rubbed her beautiful body with a rough\ntowel to bring the blood close to the surface of the skin.\n\n\"You look wonderful,\" Zen muttered, remembering what John had hinted.\n\"Did you have a good night's sleep?\"\n\n\"A couple of hours.\"\n\n\"No more than that?\"\n\n\"I needed no more.\"\n\n\"Mm?\" Zen said. He started to add another word, \"Alone?\" but managed\nto catch the question before it was out of his mouth. He examined her\nthoughtfully. \"You look very contented,\" he said, without adding that\nin his experience women who looked so contented had only one reason for\nit.\n\n\"Why shouldn't I look contented? After spending so much time in the\nwilderness, I'm back on the stairway to heaven.\"\n\n\"What's the wilderness?\"\n\n\"The world down below.\" She swept her hand in a gesture that included\nthe unseen ranges and the plains below.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" he yawned himself to wakefulness. \"I was reading the most\nfascinating book before I dropped off to sleep. Here. I'll show you.\"\n\nThe book was not on his blanket. It was not in the wall niche. Nor was\nit behind the bed. \"Hey, it's gone,\" he said. His eyes went around the\nroom. He discovered other things that were missing. \"The lieutenant's\ngun! And my pack!\"\n\n\"Perhaps you just dreamed you had been reading a book.\"\n\n\"I didn't dream the gun and the pack. I carried both of them in here.\"\n\n\"I can explain about them. They were taken.\"\n\n\"Hunh? Why?\"\n\n\"Weapons are not permitted here. Your gun and your pack were both taken\nfor this reason.\"\n\n\"Hunh?\" A growl came unbidden into his voice. He put these items out\nof his mind with the resolve to speak to someone about them at a later\ntime. Something more important had happened. What was it? A memory of\nhis dream flicked through his mind but was gone before he could grasp\nit. A frown on his face, he said, \"I know--\" As he tried to speak, what\nhe had intended to say slid out of his mind.\n\n\"You know what?\" Nedra asked.\n\n\"Everything.\"\n\nHer face showed surprise. \"This is a great deal for one man to know.\nAre you sure?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Positive?\"\n\n\"Hell, yes!\"\n\nAn emotion that was like a curtain opening and closing slipped across\nher face. \"Well, in that case, tell me things.\"\n\n\"I would, except I can't remember 'em.\"\n\nDoubt came into the violet eyes. \"What you need is some breakfast. Your\nblood sugar levels are too low. Breakfast will take care of that.\" Her\nvoice was firm and sure.\n\n\"That's one thing I need,\" Zen said, his voice equally firm. \"But there\nis one thing I don't need--an examination by a head shrinker.\"\n\n\"A what?\"\n\n\"A psycho,\" he explained. \"I call 'em head shrinkers because that\nis what they do. Oh, maybe I need such an examination but I have no\nintention of submitting to it.\"\n\nBreakfast consisted of cornmeal mush, fried to a golden brown, and\nserved with butter and honey. There was no coffee but he had long since\nlearned to do without it. He ate ravenously. \"I'm hungry right down to\nthe marrow of my bones,\" he said. \"Where does all this grub come from?\"\n\n\"We get it,\" Nedra answered evasively.\n\n\"What do you do, raid the low country for supplies, like Cuso's men?\"\n\n\"No, colonel, hardly that. We are not thieves.\" Her face showed\ndispleasure.\n\n\"Well, where do you get it? I don't know how many of you are here, but\nif you have as many as a hundred, keeping this place supplied calls for\nsome doing.\" He was fishing for information on the number of people\nhidden in this old mine.\n\n\"Actually, very little food is needed.\"\n\n\"How come, don't they eat?\"\n\n\"Are you reading my mind?\" the girl demanded. \"If so, you might as\nwell learn right now that this is not considered good manners here!\"\nMomentarily, she was angry. \"And besides, if you do it again, I'll\nclose off my thoughts to you.\"\n\nZen, with a forkful of mush halfway to his mouth, was so surprised that\nhe tried to speak and to swallow the mush at the same time, with the\nresult that he choked. The inference back of her words opened up wide\nhorizons of speculative thought. Was mind reading actually commonplace\nhere?\n\n\"I'm sorry you choked,\" Nedra said. She pounded him on the back.\n\n\"Why don't you put me over your shoulder and burp me?\" Zen complained.\n\"Lay off with that pounding.\"\n\n\"Do you feel you really need burping?\"\n\n\"Aw, shut up,\" Zen answered. If she thought he had read her mind,\ndid this mean that she was actually capable of reading his thoughts?\nCould all of these people read his mind? Had the nude bronze girl\ngoing through the rhythmic exercises known what he was thinking about\nher. Zen felt himself coloring. It was one thing to have the normal\nlibidinous impulses of the male but it was quite another thing to have\nevery woman know what he was thinking about her.\n\n\"Colonel, I do believe you are blushing,\" Nedra said, a twinkle in her\neyes.\n\n\"I am not,\" Zen said. \"Actually I was wondering--\"\n\n\"Whether or not I could read your mind? I told you it was not good\nmanners here.\"\n\n\"Good manners or not, you seemed to know what I was thinking.\"\n\n\"It isn't necessary to read your mind to know what you are thinking if\na pretty woman is concerned,\" Nedra said, primly. \"Your thoughts are\nwritten on your face.\"\n\n\"Uh!\" For a moment, his confusion grew. Her understanding was much too\nacute. Was she playing games, making fun? If so, this was a game that\ntwo could play. \"In that case, since you already know about me--how\nabout it?\" he said, looking boldly at her.\n\nShe understood his meaning. For a moment, the violet eyes showed\nsadness. They seemed to indicate that she was disappointed in him, that\nshe had hoped for much better from him. Then a sparkle came into them.\n\"I told you once before--\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know. You are going to wash out my mind with soap. But let's\nnot do it right now. I'm still hungry.\"\n\n\"You are one of the most perplexing men I have ever met,\" Nedra said,\nas she rose to fill his plate again. \"Also one of the fastest--\"\n\n\"I thought we were going to stay away from that subject,\" he protested.\n\n\"I intended to say fastest on his mental feet,\" she answered. \"And if\nyou don't stop interrupting me to make a play on words, I'm going to\ngive you a hit on the head. After that, Sam wants to see you.\"\n\n\"Sam, huh?\" he said, with no real enthusiasm in his voice. Somehow\nthis morning, he did not relish seeing the craggy man. But there was\nthe matter of the missing pack and gun to be taken up with someone in\nauthority. He suspected that West was that person.\n\nThe craggy man was alone in the room to which Nedra took him when he\nhad finished breakfast. West was standing with his back to them as\nthey entered, staring out of a picture window that was set flush with\nthe wall of the building. Turning, he nodded to them, then motioned\nto them to come and stand beside him. Kurt Zen looked out on one of\nthe most breath-takingly beautiful scenes he had ever seen. Directly\nbelow them the cliff dropped away for hundreds of feet, a blank wall\nof sheer rock. To the left, climbing up into the sky, was the peak of\nthe mountain, solid granite. They were just at the edge of timberline\nhere. Lower, the trees began: spruce, fir, and aspen, marching downward\ntier on tier over a series of rolling hills that concealed more than\nthey revealed. In the distance was the front range, a towering sweep of\nmountains that looked small but which Zen knew to be rugged country. He\nhad climbed them too recently to have any doubts as to how high they\nwere. And how rugged.\n\nIn the far distance cumulus clouds were visible, thunder-storms beyond\nthe mountains.\n\n\"_Thy purple mountain's majesty above the fruited plain...._\"\n\nThe words of the song came unbidden into Kurt's mind. Down below him\nwas--America. Or what was left of it. A pang came up in his throat at\nthe thought and he felt muscles pull and knot in his stomach. He had\nloved this land.\n\nAmerica had stood for freedom. Her sons had fought for it, on\nbattlefields in every corner of the earth, from sun-baked equatorial\nAfrica to the freezing bitter steppes of Central Asia. While her sons\nhad found graves, fighting for freedom, something had happened to the\nfreedom for which they fought.\n\nNobody knew quite what had happened, but it had gone away. Possibly\nit had been lost as emergency followed emergency on the international\nscene, possibly it had been strangled in red tape as regulation\nfollowed regulation on the national scene. The time had come in\nAmerica, too, as it had come to foreign lands, when all actions that\nwere not compulsory were forbidden.\n\nThus freedom had died.\n\n\"Do you feel as bad as all that, colonel?\" West said softly. The man's\nface was grave and each ridge on it seemed carved out of another and\nharder kind of granite.\n\n\"It seems such a shame,\" Zen said. \"I loved this land. It was my\ncountry. And I don't feel that I have to apologize for a gulp in my\ntongue as I talk about it.\"\n\n\"It is not necessary to apologize for loving one's own land, colonel,\"\nWest said, his voice softer still. \"You are not alone.\"\n\n\"Not alone?\" Zen said. \"From you, this talk sounds strange.\"\n\n\"We have all loved this land, too, colonel, and the principles for\nwhich it stood. That is why we are here.\" West's voice became softer\nstill, but the gravity in his face seemed to increase.\n\n\"That is good talk,\" Zen said. \"However, if I have learned one thing,\nit is that talk is cheap. You are outlaws hiding here yet you talk of\nloving the land that you have failed to serve.\" He felt his voice grate\nas he spoke.\n\n\"Bravely spoken, colonel,\" West applauded. A glint that might have\nbeen appreciation and might have been the edge of hidden anger\nshowed in his eyes. \"Particularly so since you are in the power of\nthese--ah--outlaws.\"\n\n\"Very brave,\" Nedra agreed. \"And very foolish.\"\n\n\"You did not bring me here to tell me that I am in your power,\" Zen\nanswered. \"Nor to comment on my bravery. Nor my foolishness.\"\n\n\"I think he can read minds,\" Nedra said.\n\n\"I do not in the least doubt it,\" West answered. \"If he did not possess\nthis ability, or almost possess it, he would not be here.\"\n\n\"I, in my turn, think both of you are nuts,\" Zen answered. \"I'm not\nputting on a mind-reading act.\"\n\n\"Not consciously, colonel, of course,\" West agreed. \"You think your\nthoughts are your own. Often they are. But there are also times when\nthey have originated with somebody else. However, before you tell me\nthat I did not call you up here to discuss your mind-reading ability,\nor lack of it, I will show you one reason why I wanted you. Take the\nglasses, observe the ridge in the far distance, just under the pines.\nTell me what you see there.\"\n\n\"Horses,\" Zen said. \"No, mules. With riders. Cuso's men going out on a\nraiding party looking for food, ammo, and women, if they can catch 'em.\"\n\n\"Quite right, colonel. Except that they probably have the additional\nduty of inspecting the damage their blooper did when it exploded.\"\n\n\"I hope they inspect that damage from close range,\" Zen said fervidly.\n\"That area is hot. If they will only spend an hour or so--\" He broke\noff as he remembered that both Nedra and West had spent too much time\nin the same hot zone.\n\n\"They will not be that foolish,\" West said.\n\n\"I know some people who were,\" Zen said.\n\n\"Perhaps the area, at least on the fringes, was not as hot as you had\nthought,\" West suggested.\n\n\"My counter said it was,\" Zen answered.\n\n\"Possibly your counter was in error. Now if you will come into this\nroom, colonel.\" West moved through an archway in the stone wall and\ninto another room, holding the heavy draperies aside so Zen and Nedra\ncould enter. An opaque screen was set into the wall. Several chairs,\nincluding one large seat with control buttons built into the arms,\nwere in this room. West closed the curtain over the arch through which\nthey had entered and motioned Zen to a chair. The craggy man slid into\nthe chair with the buttons on the arms. Nedra sat beside Zen. Relaxed\nand at ease in the chair, she seemed to have forgotten that such\ncreatures as colonels of intelligence existed. West pushed a button.\nLight flicked across the screen, danced an erratic pattern there, and\nvanished. An image began to form. Firming, it increased in detail, and\nbecame a city.\n\nOr what had once been a city.\n\nThe place was blackened now, the buildings lying in ruins. Towers had\ntoppled, windows had broken, the ravages of fire were visible. Here\nand there tall buildings had crumbled into streets that crossed and\ncriss-crossed each other at crazy angles. The rubble from the broken\nbuildings still lay where it had fallen.\n\n\"Washington, by thunder!\" Zen said. \"This was their prime target. We\nstopped their bombers cold but they eventually got through with a\nguided missile. The city is still hot. You can see it right there on\nthe screen. Not a sign of life!\" He became excited as he re-lived those\nfirst mad moments when the Asian Federation had struck out of nowhere.\nIn this moment what little freedom that had remained in America had\nbeen given up in the face of the seemingly more important necessity of\nremaining alive.\n\n\"Yes,\" West said. \"Now what do you see?\"\n\nThe ruined Washington faded from the scene. As it faded, the broken\ndome of the capitol building--its top had been blown off in the\nblast--was revealed looking like a mysterious crater on the moon open\nto the sea of space.\n\nAnother city came on the screen, a mass of broken buildings where two\nrivers met.\n\n\"I think that's Pittsburgh,\" Zen said. \"They were eager to hit us\nthere, to cut down on our industrial production potential. They got\nGary, Indiana, and South Chicago, for the same reason. In spite of\neverything we could do to stop it, they eventually got through to our\nmajor production centers. If we hadn't foreseen the possibility of this\nhappening, and had not spread our industry across the country, breaking\nit up into small parts, they would have crippled us so badly before the\nwar even started that we would not have lasted long. However, even with\nour production spread, when they hit the sources of our raw materials,\nthey hurt us--bad. Our stock piles gave out after a couple of years.\nSince then we've been scavenging for metal wherever we can find it.\"\n\n\"Yes. I know,\" West said.\n\n\"Of course, while they were hurting us, we weren't exactly helping\nthem,\" Zen said. \"We had a few guided missiles ready in their launching\nracks ourselves. We weren't exactly defenseless.\" Pride came into his\nvoice as he spoke.\n\n\"I agree with you there,\" West said. \"Would you like to see some of our\nresults.\"\n\n\"Hell, yes,\" Zen blurted out, surprised. \"Our photo ships have never\ngotten really good pics. Have to fly too high for that. Oh, we have\nturned loose a flood of pics that purported to show how we had bombed\nhell out of the enemy, but these were all re-touched, to boost public\nmorale. But--how does this radar work? Do you mean to tell me you can\nactually see what is going on inside the country of the enemy?\" Puzzled\nwonder crept into his voice. Behind the feeling was a keen interest. If\nhe could use this radar to see into the country of the enemy, it was a\nvery important invention, though West did not seem to realize this.\n\nIn war, information was always as important as weapons, and sometimes\nmore so. Knowledge of the enemy's troop dispositions, of his strength\nand his weaknesses, was often more than half the battle.\n\nWest did not answer. Another city swam into position on the screen. Zen\ncaught a glimpse of a single minaret standing among the bare ruins and\nhazarded a guess as to the identity of the city.\n\n\"Moscow?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good. One of our fast planes sneaked over in full daylight, dumping\nhis load. When the photo plane passed over hours later, the city was\nstill burning. We really blasted the hell out of that dump!\"\n\n\"You sound pleased, colonel. Do you know how many millions of people\ndied directly or indirectly in that bomb explosion?\"\n\n\"How many millions died in Washington, Pittsburgh, and Chicago?\" Zen\nflared.\n\n\"Granted,\" West answered. \"But after the first man has been killed,\ndoes it help the situation to kill a second? Or does killing the\nsecond one merely make it more likely that a third one will have to be\ndestroyed?\"\n\n\"What the hell difference does it make? This is war.\"\n\n\"That is also granted. However, the rules of life do not change because\nmen declare war.\"\n\n\"Don't be so damned academic that you forget to be realistic. They were\nstriking at our heart,\" Zen said, bitterness deep in his voice. \"Look,\nwe didn't seek this war. We did everything we could to prevent it. We\ntried compromise, arbitration, placation, and everything else we could\nthink of. Nothing worked. They struck in the dark, without warning.\" As\nhe spoke, his bitterness turned into deep anger.\n\n\"That is also granted,\" West said, while the ruined city was displayed\non the screen. \"But does it make a great deal of difference?\"\n\nZen stared at the man, wondering what kind of a human he was. In the\ndim room, it was difficult to make out West's features. \"It makes all\nthe difference in the world. We believed in fairness. They ignored it.\nWe believed in a better world. They would plunge us back into the night\nof barbarism. We believed in freedom. They wanted slaves. They set up a\nslave state and threw armed slaves against free men. We had no choice\nexcept to fight back.\"\n\n\"I see nothing to argue in all you have said,\" West answered. \"Nor\nis it to my purpose to attempt to justify the actions of the western\ndemocracies. They need no justification. Nor do the actions of the\nAsian Federation need justification. In their eyes, they were right.\"\nHis voice was a low monotone of sound without the trace of an emotion\nin it.\n\n\"Then what is your purpose?\" Zen demanded.\n\n\"First, to point out that the human race is one organism. Viewed in\nits totality, it is just that, an organism. All the billions of\nindividuals who compose it are cells in that organism.\"\n\n\"I am familiar with that theory,\" Zen answered. \"A few crackpots have\nalways insisted that we are a biological entity. But they have not\nsucceeded in proving this.\"\n\n\"Haven't they?\" West said. The slightest touch of irony appeared in his\nvoice.\n\n\"Not so far as I know.\"\n\n\"Is it possible, colonel, that you do not know everything?\" West asked.\n\n\"It is not only possible, it is obvious,\" Zen answered, unruffled by\nthe cutting question. \"If I knew everything, I wouldn't be sitting here\ntalking to you. I would be out there winning a war.\"\n\n\"The point I want to make, colonel, is that the human race is divided\nagainst itself. Historically, this has been going on since remote ages.\nWar after war after war.\"\n\n\"I do not see how America is responsible for the errors of history,\"\nZen said. \"We tried to avoid them. God knows we tried.\" Emphasis crept\ninto his voice.\n\n\"I did not say these were errors, colonel,\" West replied. \"I merely\nsaid they were history.\"\n\n\"But what point are you making if not the one that wars are mistakes?\"\nZen asked, surprised at the way the other's thinking had gone.\n\n\"I am making the point that war seems to be the way the entity, the\nhuman race as a whole, evolves. The method of evolution revealed by\nhistory is the pitting of one part of the entity against another part,\nthen letting them fight it out to see which is the more efficient.\" A\ntouch of grimness sounded in the voice of the craggy man. In the dimly\nlighted room, his face was as bleak--and as lonely--as the granite\noutcropping at the top of a mountain.\n\n\"This is a very savage philosophy,\" Kurt Zen commented.\n\n\"If I may disagree with you again, colonel, I do not think that this\nphilosophy is necessarily savage. True, a great many men die in\nfiendishly ingenious ways. A great many women and children suffer.\nTrue, this system produces hunger in the world, and a fear so deep and\nso intense that the heart is hurt even to contemplate it.\"\n\n\"How can this be anything but savage?\" Zen protested. \"I don't care\nwhether our side or the other side is doing it--it's still total\nsavagery, utter barbarism!\"\n\n\"But that is a short-term view and one which does not take into\nconsideration all the factors in the equation. What is the purpose\nback of this savagery, if it is not to force men to learn and to grow?\nWhat if this so-called savagery is also the result of ignorance, of an\nentity trying desperately to learn how to solve a problem, but never\nquite succeeding?\"\n\n\"But surely there must be some way which does not involve so much\nsuffering,\" Zen protested. He was growing more and more uncomfortable.\nIt was his impression that he was shifting sides in the argument\nwithout quite realizing he was doing it. Or perhaps West was the one\nwho was shifting sides. This side-changing was producing confusion in\nhis thinking.\n\n\"I have harbored the same hope,\" West answered. \"However, I know of no\nway to accomplish this result. In a human being, we have a growing,\nevolving organism that is possessed of a keen brain and a vast\ncuriosity. Such an organism, by its very nature, will have to try every\npossible road.\" West pressed a button.\n\nAgain the screen came to life. Dim and shadowy, human figures began to\nmove there. Kurt Zen leaned forward to see them more clearly.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nAt first, the figures were indistinct and Zen could not see them\nclearly. He mentioned this to West.\n\n\"They will get sharper in a minute,\" the craggy man answered. His voice\nhad sunk to a whisper heard from afar. Zen glanced at him to make\ncertain he was still there. The colonel had the flickering impression\nthat the chair was vacant but before the impression could firm itself,\nWest, faster than the eyes could follow, seemed to be back in the\nchair. \"Note the screen now, Kurt,\" West said.\n\nThe figures had become clear. It seemed to be a view of some kind of\nunderground cavern where men were working on an object that looked\nlike--Zen squinted his eyes, to make certain.\n\n\"A small space ship!\" the colonel said. He felt eagerness rise in his\nvoice. Like so many kids born in the age of science, he had harbored\nthe dream of the days to come when men would fly beyond the sky, to\nstoried space islands that lay afar. Science had promised that this\nwould happen and the fiction writers had embellished this belief with\ndream worlds. Somehow, it had never come to pass. One problem after\nanother had prevented realization of this dream. The war, which should\nhave accelerated development, had stopped it completely. Neither side\nhad the materials or the engineers or the skilled technicians to\nconstruct a vessel capable of space flight.\n\n\"No,\" West said. His voice was toneless and the far-away note was still\nstrong in it. \"Sorry to contradict you, colonel, but that is not a\nsmall space ship, though it is designed to get out of the atmosphere\nfor a short time. Look again.\"\n\n\"Hell, it's a super bomb!\" Zen gasped, as recognition came to him.\n\n\"Right, colonel!\"\n\n\"A bomb big enough to devastate a continent!\" Cold currents suddenly\nflurried at the base of Zen's spine.\n\n\"Right, colonel.\" West's voice was as dry as the Nevada wind.\n\n\"I didn't know we had such a bomb under construction,\" Zen blurted out.\n\n\"We haven't.\"\n\n\"Then who--where?\" The cold currents at the base of Zen's back were\nflowing down both legs and up his spine.\n\n\"Look at the men, colonel. Look closely.\" West's voice was also cold.\n\n\"They're Asiatics!\" Shouting the words, Zen was out of his chair. \"I\ndidn't see the yellow faces and the slanted eyes at first. West, that's\na huge guided missile. It's being built to drop out of the sky at\nthousands of miles an hour, on us!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" West said. He did not move a muscle in his body. On the other\nside of Kurt Zen, Nedra sat equally silent and motionless.\n\n\"I have to get out of here,\" Zen said. \"This information must be\nreported to the general staff, at once!\" Urgency pounded in the tones\nof his voice.\n\n\"The new people do not fight,\" West said. \"I thought you were one of\nus.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter who I am,\" Zen said quickly. \"The building of this\nsuper bomb must be reported. _It must be!_ Extra warnings must be\nissued. We must alert every z-type fighter we possess and have them in\nthe air constantly, in the hope that we can destroy this bomb before\nit lands. We've got to follow the construction hourly, so we will know\nwhen it is ready to be launched. And that means we've got to have\ntop-flight intelligence men here, to follow the building of that bomb\nevery inch of the way. Or we've got to take this super-radar of yours\nto headquarters and use it there. That's the best solution, if it is\nat all practical.\" Zen was striding back and forth in the darkened\nroom, planning the steps that had to be taken.\n\n\"West, do you realize this super-radar of yours will win the war!\"\nExcitement tightened the colonel's voice. \"With it, the enemy won't\nbe able to make a move that we don't know about in advance.\" His\nexcitement grew as the vast longing hidden in him for the end of the\nwar tried to come to the surface.\n\n\"You have tears in your eyes, colonel,\" West said.\n\n\"You're out of your mind,\" Zen retorted. But he knew the craggy man was\nspeaking the truth. He swallowed harder. \"We've got the Asians cold.\nWe'll know every move they make in advance.\" He exulted as he realized\nagain how much this meant.\n\n\"I have always known every move they made in advance,\" West answered.\n\n\"We'll have them on their knees in--huh? What was that you just said?\nWhat was that?\" Desperation appeared in the colonel's voice.\n\nWest repeated his words.\n\n\"Then why didn't you warn us?\" Zen felt each word sting as it left his\nlips. \"Why didn't you warn us? Why did you let so many of us die so\nunnecessarily?\"\n\nWest did not answer.\n\nThe silence in the room grew deeper. Cold had begun to appear in the\nair. On the screen, the silent figures continued busily engaged in the\nbuilding of their bomb.\n\n\"Don't you realize that your failure to report what you knew is high\ntreason?\" Zen continued.\n\nThe silence grew. West sat as solid and as immobile as a mountain.\nNedra seemed to have shrunk in upon herself still farther. More than\never she looked like a very small girl who had somehow managed to\nintrude into a world of adults and was tremendously confused and hurt\nby what was happening here.\n\n\"Don't you hear me?\" Zen said.\n\n\"I hear you,\" West answered. \"Your loyalty to your country does you\ncredit, colonel. It is to be expected from a person in your stage\nof development. However, you seem to have forgotten that I am not a\ncitizen of your country. Or perhaps you did not know this?\"\n\n\"Not a citizen?\" Zen said. \"But this mountain exists in America.\nI don't know whether it is actually on Canadian ground or lies in\nthe United States, but this does not matter. By mutual treaty, the\ncountries have become one nation. A citizen of one is automatically a\ncitizen of the other.\"\n\n\"True, colonel.\" West did not attempt to explain.\n\n\"Then what country do you claim to belong to?\" Zen felt his voice\nfalter as he tried to grasp what lay back of this very strange man.\n\"You talk like an American.\"\n\n\"I was born here.\"\n\n\"Then you are a citizen.\"\n\n\"No. I resigned my citizenship. As to my real country, it is a far\nland. I am sure you have no knowledge of it. My loyalty, colonel, is\nnot to any nation on the face of the globe, but is to--growth, to the\nnew people who will come into existence one day.\"\n\nAs West spoke, the cold that was freezing Zen's spine suddenly\ndisappeared and was replaced by a sudden deep warmth. The words seemed\nto touch some hidden spring of warmth within him.\n\n\"My loyalty is to the future, to the growing tip of the life force,\nto what the human race will become, not to what it is today. Only the\nfuture has meaning, colonel, and to the building of that future I have\ndedicated my life.\"\n\nIn spite of the fact that the words thrilled him, Zen knew he had to\ndeny them. \"This is sophistry,\" he snapped. \"I think any court in the\nland would hold it to be evasion of your proper duties. You can't\ncontinue living in a country and enjoying its ble--\" Confusion came\ninto Zen's mind.\n\n\"Were you going to say _blessings_, colonel?\" West said, almost\nmaliciously.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Would you point out these blessings?\"\n\n\"We had them once,\" Zen said. \"And we're going to have them again.\"\n\n\"Are you?\" West nodded toward the screen where the far-off enemy\ntechnicians and engineers were busy with their super bomb.\n\n\"Now that we know that it exists, that bomb will never land,\" Zen said.\n\"I'll see to that personally.\"\n\n\"How are you going to discharge this responsibility?\" West inquired.\n\n\"I'll find a way,\" Zen answered.\n\n\"I admire your spirit, colonel, though not necessarily your evaluation\nof your personal position at this moment. Also, there is one other\nthing that I want you to see.\"\n\nThe screen went blank. Slowly another scene formed on it. Zen, staring,\nblurted out words.\n\n\"That's another one. They're making two of those super bombs. I didn't\nthink they had the materials and the technical know-how to make even\none! This doubles the problem, and more than doubles the urgency. We'll\nhave to guard the skyways from all directions, including straight up.\nDamn it, West!\" Zen slapped his fist into his open palm to emphasize\nhis feeling of urgency.\n\n\"Look again, colonel,\" the craggy man invited.\n\nOn second look Zen saw something that he had missed before. \"Those are\nAmericans! We're building that bomb!\" His words were little gusts of\nexplosive sound in the quiet room.\n\n\"Right,\" West said. His voice was very grim.\n\n\"Then it's a race to see which side gets its bomb built first?\" Zen\nasked. He did not know whether or not he liked what his eyes were\nseeing and the interpretation his mind was giving him.\n\n\"I am afraid that is true,\" West reluctantly agreed. \"But doesn't that\nchange the picture, colonel?\"\n\n\"How?\" Zen demanded. \"We're going to win a war. We've got to win it.\"\nThe words were firmly spoken but somewhere a lingering doubt remained\nas if some point had not been considered.\n\n\"The other side also thinks it has to win,\" West pointed out.\n\n\"To hell with what they think. They started it. We didn't. Man, you\ndon't intend to tell me that you are going to sit right here and watch\ntwo nations frantically try to destroy each other--and maybe the Earth\nwith them--when you have the means to stop it in your hand?\" Horror\nexploded in Zen's words.\n\n\"I am going to do just that,\" West stated. His voice was as firm and as\nsolid as the granite core of a mountain.\n\n\"But you can't!\" Zen expostulated.\n\n\"Why can't I?\" West demanded. \"I am not a citizen of either country and\nI owe nothing to any nation.\"\n\n\"Even if you are not a citizen of either country, you're still a human\nbeing. You owe loyalty to your own race,\" Zen said.\n\nThe craggy man showed faint signs of discomfort. But when he spoke, his\nvoice was still imperturbable. \"Granting your statement, what do you\npropose I do?\"\n\n\"Stop the Asians,\" Zen answered promptly. \"Give us complete information\non the location of their super-bomb. We'll make certain we get ours\nfinished first and we'll use it to blow their installation out of\nexistence.\" At the moment, his plan seemed feasible.\n\n\"That would create the very danger you are trying to avoid, would it\nnot?\" West pointed out. \"Both super bombs would explode simultaneously.\nDo you think the Earth would remain in its orbit if this happened?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Zen answered. \"That would be up to the astronomers and\nthe astronomical physicists to decide. In any case, if the danger is\ntoo great, we'll use ordinary weapons to touch off their super bomb.\nWell get the job done before they finish.\"\n\n\"They are working underground, in a cavern at least three thousand feet\ndeep,\" West pointed out. \"Do you have a weapon that will penetrate to\nthis depth?\"\n\n\"We'll build one!\"\n\n\"You talk very glibly, colonel.\"\n\n\"Somebody has got to talk!\" Zen said fiercely. \"Even if they are\nbuilding their bomb underground, they must have an exit for it\nsomewhere. We'll locate their exit and drop an H-bomb on it.\"\n\n\"And thus destroy their bomb and the best of their scientists and\nengineers?\"\n\n\"This is war. You can't have sympathy in war.\"\n\n\"This is my point, colonel,\" West said patiently. \"I have no\nsympathy--with either side.\"\n\n\"Then what do you propose--to sit here and do nothing?\"\n\n\"I propose to let each side destroy the other as much as they wish and\ncan. Then, when they have completely demonstrated the futility of their\nefforts, when it is utterly clear to the few who have survived that\nwarfare is not the way to the future, then the new people will emerge\nto show the way to those who have survived.\" West's voice was calm. He\nseemed to be considering a situation often pondered and to be stating a\nconclusion firmly and definitely reached.\n\n\"But that involves senseless slaughter,\" Zen protested. \"This was the\nreason that lay back of the dropping of the first atom bomb--to stop\nsenseless slaughter.\"\n\n\"All slaughter is senseless, colonel, though from the viewpoint of the\nindividual or nation doing it, slaughter is generally considered to be\nright at the time.\"\n\nZen started to comment on what the craggy man had just said, then\nchanged his mind. Was he dealing with a madman? This seemed possible.\nWest's words certainly did not fit any pattern that Zen knew. The act\nof sitting by and letting two nations commit suicide went beyond the\nbounds of rational thinking.\n\n\"I beg you, let me report this to the high command,\" Zen said, making\none last plea.\n\n\"In reply, I want to ask one question,\" West answered. \"What would\nhappen to the people here, and to me, if I revealed the existence of\nthis instrument?\"\n\n\"You would be a hero,\" Zen said promptly, and knew he was lying as he\nspoke. \"Your people would be protected.\"\n\n\"I dislike calling you a liar, colonel, but that is exactly what you\nare,\" West answered. \"We would all be taken care of, as long as all\nof us did exactly what the high command wanted. The instant I tried\nto do anything else, my actions would be called treason and I would\nbe considered a traitor. My equipment would be confiscated, '_for the\nconvenience of the government_,' and I would be lucky if I did not face\na firing squad. Tell me honestly, colonel, would not this happen?\" For\nthe first time, West's words had a tinge of anger in them. Or was it\nsorrow?\n\n\"Sam--\" Nedra said. \"Something--\" Her voice was a whisper from some\nfar-off land.\n\n\"What is it, Nedra?\" West asked. In an instant, he had forgotten all\nabout Kurt Zen.\n\nThe nurse sat up straight and stiff. All color fled from her face.\n\"Something--\" Her voice was the faintest whisper of sound in this quiet\nroom.\n\n\"Nedra, what is it?\" West's tones had alarm in them.\n\nInstead of answering, the nurse slid from her chair to the floor, in a\nfaint.\n\nDim and distant in the silence that followed came a popping sound.\n\n_Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat--_\n\nZen had heard this death-dealing rattle too often to mistake its\nidentity.\n\n\"A sub-machine gun!\"\n\nThe drapes that covered the archway leading into this hidden room were\nshoved aside. A man fell through them. Zen knew at a glance that he\nwas another of the kids who lived here in this hidden cavern inside a\nmountain. Blood was spewing from a hole in his back and he was fighting\ndesperately for breath.\n\n\"They're--coming with guns!\" he gasped.\n\nWest dropped to his knees and took the head of the youth in his lap.\nHis face was dark as he saw the wound on the back. Cuddling the youth's\nhead in his lap as one would a frightened child, he asked, \"What\nhappened, Carl?\"\n\n\"I don't know. They came out of nowhere. There was no one. Then these\nmen were here. They came--shooting.\" Blood came out of his mouth as\nhe spoke. He tried to cough it away, and failed. His hand went to his\nmouth and wiped at the blood, then he lifted his hand to his eyes and\nsaw what was there.\n\n\"How many are there?\" Zen asked.\n\nCarl's eyes wandered until he found the source of this question.\n\"Dozens,\" he said, his voice dull. Blood was draining from his mouth\nacross West's legs and was forming a pool on the floor.\n\nListening, Zen could distinguish three machine guns going now. Men were\nyelling. A girl was screaming. At the sounds, the colonel's lips formed\ninto a line as sharp as the edge of a knife.\n\n\"How did they get past your fear generators?\" he said to West.\n\n\"I don't know,\" the craggy man answered. \"Perhaps they found an\nunguarded tunnel.\"\n\nZen could not see what difference it made how the intruders had secured\nentry. They were here. \"Where are your weapons?\" he demanded. In his\nmind was the thought that the new people would have weapons adequate to\ndefend their own citadel.\n\n\"Weapons?\" West did not seem to understand the term. \"We have none.\"\n\n\"What?\" Zen said. Hadn't West understood him. Every farmer, every\nrancher, and every householder had his stock of weapons. Almost all\npeople went armed. \"No rifles?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Not even tear gas?\"\n\n\"No, colonel.\"\n\n\"Then how in the hell did you expect to stay alive?\" Zen burst out.\n\"You surely knew they would find you sometime.\"\n\n\"Staying alive is actually not as important as you think. Yes, son.\"\nWest bent again to listen to the youth's words.\n\n\"Good--good--\" The whisper was very faint.\n\nWest understood. \"Goodbye,\" he said. \"We will meet again. But, goodbye\nfor now.\"\n\nThe youth sighed. All pain and all fear went from his face. Peace came\nto him.\n\nBut when West rose to his feet, his face was bleak. \"He was new here,\"\nhe said as if this explained something that he felt needed explaining.\n\nSomewhere a woman was screaming. West listened to the sound, then\nstarted toward it. Zen caught his arm.\n\n\"The invaders have guns.\" His tone conveyed the impression that West\nwas at fault because no weapons existed inside the mine. \"Or do you\nwant to go join him?\" He nodded toward the body on the floor. Blood\nhad stopped spilling from that body now. The essence of life had gone\nelsewhere and the tides of life had ceased flowing.\n\n\"Yes,\" West said bluntly. \"I want to go with him.\" His face had grown\nmore black. Heat lightning was dancing in his eyes.\n\nZen caught the impulse to say that this made two of them who wanted to\njoin the bronze-skinned youth. He knew how to deal with this reaction.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said. \"Good bye.\"\n\nWest blinked startled eyes at him.\n\n\"Run along,\" Zen said.\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"I'll take over here and fight the battle you are running from,\" Zen\ncontinued.\n\nAs if he were dispelling a mist from some hidden corner of his mind,\nthe craggy man shook his head. \"Sorry,\" he apologized. \"However, the\ncall is very strong. Only the sense of a job not yet done has kept me\nfrom going for--a long time.\" He shook his head again. \"No, I shall not\nfollow him, for another while, though I am positive that he is luckier\nthan we are.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" Zen said.\n\nStooping, West picked up Nedra. She lay in his arms like a tired,\nsleeping child. Had she followed the youth? Kurt Zen had a moment of\nheartbreak as the thought passed through his mind before he saw that\nshe was still breathing regularly.\n\n\"Follow me,\" West said.\n\nThe heat lightning still danced in the eyes of the craggy man as he\nmoved across the room. The solid wall swung aside into another hidden\ndoor. \"None of my people know this is here,\" he explained. \"The\ncombination lock is actuated only by my body.\"\n\nAs Kurt Zen went through the door he could hear the girl still\nscreaming somewhere.\n\nThe passage was narrow. To one side, another passage led into a room\nwhere Zen caught a glimpse of some kind of electrical equipment in\noperation, the technical guts of the super-radar, he suspected.\n\nAhead, West growled, a sound that came from deep in his throat. He had\nstopped and was staring down into a hidden opening in the wall. Zen saw\nthat the opening, through some hidden arrangement of mirrors, revealed\nthe interior of the big gallery where he had spent the night.\n\nHell was loose in there now.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nJake, Ed, and Cal were part of that hell. Each carried a smoking weapon\nin his hands. A body lay on the floor. Somewhere in one of the small\nrooms a woman was screaming. In the middle of the room stood the man\nwho was obviously in charge of the situation. At the sight of this man,\nKurt Zen felt his breath draw into his body so heavily that it whistled\nthrough his nostrils.\n\nCuso's lieutenant!\n\nThe others in the room were the Asians who had been with the lieutenant\nthe night before.\n\n\"I should have slit their throats while they were asleep and in my\npower last night,\" Zen raged.\n\nThe only sound in the passage was that of West breathing heavily, like\na man who had run a marathon and had lost. No, there were two men!\nAdditional shock came up in Kurt Zen when he realized he was the second\nman. He seized the craggy man by the shoulder.\n\n\"West! They can't have that super radar. If we lose that, we have lost\nthe war.\"\n\nThe craggy man did not move.\n\nAnguish grew in Zen's voice. \"If we lose this one, it will be the first\nwar we have ever lost. And the last one. Nothing will remain to come\nafter us except death and desolation.\"\n\n\"I know,\" West said. \"The race soul will have to start over, in the\nswamps and on the mud flats, trying to rebuild the race with tools long\nsince worn out and out of place in time.\" Again the tones of a bell\nwere in his voice. But now the bell was tolling the death of a people,\nwailing that the glory that once had been was truly gone, wailing that\nthe brave world that some men had tried to build was going into ashes\nand into doom.\n\n\"Do you believe in the race soul too?\" West gasped.\n\n\"_Belief_ is too weak a word. I _know_ it exists.\"\n\nNedra sighed in West's arms and opened her eyes. Seeing who was holding\nher, she lay back in the arms of the craggy man, more than ever like a\ntired child. \"What was it?\" she whispered. \"What's wrong? I--I took a\nlittle nap.\"\n\nWest set her on her feet and pointed at the opening. She clutched at\nthe stone wall as she saw what was happening inside.\n\nRunning, the bronze girl who had danced to the slow music the night\nbefore, came fleeing from a room. One of Cuso's soldiers was pursuing\nher. She fled like a deer before some great hound that was interested\nin pulling her down but she did not flee fast enough. The soldier\ncaught her and dragged her back into a room.\n\n\"West, how many of these kids did you have here?\" Zen asked.\n\n\"About fifty,\" the craggy man answered. \"I don't know how many are\nleft nor can I guess how many will choose to stay alive if they are\nconquered before their training is completed.\"\n\n\"And no weapons?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"What about my gun that was taken from me while I slept?\"\n\n\"What good would one gun do now?\"\n\n\"None, I guess,\" Zen said, helplessly. \"But as they try to run me down,\nI'd like to have it in my hands. I'd at least take a few of them with\nme before they got me.\"\n\n\"We will survive,\" West said, his voice a mumble.\n\nZen pointed through the opening to the bodies lying on the floor below\nthem. \"They didn't,\" he said.\n\nThe craggy man groaned. \"If I had time I would try to explain to you\nthat survival does not lie in the body and can never be achieved there.\"\n\nZen answered, \"I have no time for metaphysics. For purposes of defense,\nI'm taking command.\" He felt foolish as he spoke. What resources were\nhis to command, what troops, what weapons? He knew the answer as the\nthought crossed his mind. If he only had the remnants of the broken\ncolumn moving down the mountains after its disastrous encounter with\nCuso's blooper. An idea came into his mind. Perhaps he could have these\ntroops. \"Where's my pack?\" he demanded. His radio equipment was in that.\n\n\"It went with your gun into the deep hole,\" West said. \"The deep hole\nis a fault the old miners uncovered here. It's miles deep.\" He shook\nhis head.\n\n\"Damn!\" Kurt Zen said. The depression in him was as deep as the fault\nin the mountain. \"Isn't there any place where we can hide?\"\n\n\"Many places,\" West said. \"This whole mountain is a honeycomb of\ntunnels and shafts. We have explored fifteen separate levels and there\nare others which lie below the present water line.\" He did not protest\nat Zen's statement that the latter was taking command, but seemed\nwilling to submit to the colonel's authority, and also interested in\nseeing how Zen would handle the problem.\n\n\"Then find us a place to hide until we can decide what to do to\neliminate Cuso's men. A hiding hole first, then radio equipment. As\nsoon as I can gain access to short-wave transmitting equipment, I can\nhave a regiment of paratroopers on their way here.\"\n\n\"You sound as if you have authority,\" Nedra commented.\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"But you gave me the impression you were a deserter.\"\n\n\"They haven't discovered that yet, at headquarters. So far as they are\nconcerned, I'm on a secret mission. And I haven't deserted the human\nrace.\" Zen put sting into his words. The implication was that two\npeople present were really deserters.\n\n\"Ah, well, colonel, we shall see about that.\" West had recovered most\nof his aplomb. Again he seemed to be observing from a great distance\nthe antics of this strange species called human. But his face remained\nbleak and his eyes had flickers of lightning in them. He started away\nfrom the opening.\n\nAnd stopped as metal clanged ahead of them.\n\nA door opened there. An Asian soldier with his rifle at the ready came\nthrough. A second one followed the first. The rifles of both covered\nWest.\n\nZen jerked his arms toward the roof. Neither the craggy man nor Nedra\nmoved a muscle.\n\nSlowly, West and Nedra raised their hands. At gun point, the two\nsoldiers herded them toward the main gallery. At the sight of them the\nlieutenant hastily called Cal to him.\n\n\"Is this the one?\" he demanded, pointing at West.\n\n\"That's him,\" Cal answered. \"He's the leader here. He's the one you\nwant.\"\n\nElation appeared as a shock-wave on the yellow face of the Asian\nlieutenant. Calling two men to him, he had West step aside, treating\nthe craggy man with respect that bordered on deference but also with\ngreat firmness.\n\n\"You two stand against the wall with the others,\" he said to Nedra and\nKurt Zen. There was no deference in his voice as he spoke to them. \"If\nthey move, shoot them!\" he ordered his men. As Kurt and Nedra obeyed,\nthe lieutenant drew West to one side and began a conversation with him.\nHis men were still busy searching the old mine tunnels. Now and then\nthey brought more captives to the main gallery.\n\nCal, Jake, and Ed remained in the center of the big room. Cal was\ntrying to look important but the expression on his face indicated he\nwas hiding guilt pangs somewhere inside. As soon as he saw Nedra, Ed's\neyes became fixed on her though he did not look at her face. Jake's\nmurky eyes were roving the chamber. He did not seem to comprehend what\nhe was seeing but seemed to be living in some other world that was even\nmore confusing and more clouded than this one.\n\nThe bronze girl, utterly naked, came limping into the gallery from\none of the small rooms. She had a dazed expression on her face and\nshe looked around the room as if she could not comprehend what was\nhappening. At the sight of her, the lieutenant left off talking to West\nfor a moment, his eyes glowing. But his conversation with West was more\nimportant than his lust. He motioned with his gun for the bronze girl\nto take her place against the wall. She stared at him as if she did not\nunderstand him. He waved the gun again.\n\nSome dull comprehension of his meaning penetrated her mind. She\nstumbled to the wall but fell face downward on the stone floor.\n\nNedra, with a little cry of pity on her lips, moved quickly to the side\nof the bronze girl. Zen started to move, then stopped, but not because\nthe rifle of one of the guards was swinging up to menace him. Nedra\ngave a quick examination of the girl, then got slowly to her feet.\n\n\"Dead?\" Zen said.\n\n\"Y-es. But how did you know?\"\n\n\"Just a hunch. What caused it, shock?\"\n\n\"I imagine so. After she was violated, she wanted to die. So she really\ndied because she wanted to. I--I--\" Tears appeared in Nedra's violet\neyes and ran down her cheeks. But she did not sob, though muscles moved\nin her throat.\n\nWest glanced at the bronze girl. He seemed to know, without being told,\nwhat had happened. His face became bleak. The lieutenant regarded the\nbody of the dead girl with regret. When the soldier who had violated\nher came out of the room, the lieutenant ordered him to remove the\nbody.\n\nZen got the impression that the lieutenant, even though he was talking\nearnestly with the craggy man, was waiting. Forty of the new people\nwere herded into the room and forced to stand against the walls. Bronze\nstriplings, they were. Not a one was out of his twenties and several\nwere obviously in their teens. Though they were confused, they kept\nsilent.\n\n\"Is this all?\" Zen heard the lieutenant ask West.\n\nThe craggy man must have known at a glance the answer to this question\nbut he took the time to count every person. \"This is all,\" he said\npositively. The lieutenant seemed to believe him but Zen would have\ngiven odds that the man was lying.\n\nThe lieutenant continued to wait.\n\nA guard, entering hastily, saluted. When Zen saw who was following the\nsoldier he realized why the lieutenant had been waiting.\n\nCuso came into the gallery.\n\nThe Asian leader was a giant almost seven feet tall and big in\nproportion. He looked capable of killing a man with his bare hands, and\nprobably was. Just looking at him, Zen knew why he had been selected to\nlead the airborne landing in America. Radiating power and strength, he\nwas the type for this kind of mission.\n\nBesides power, he radiated something else. Zen sensed this something\nelse as a sickening feeling at the pit of his stomach, a tightening of\nmuscles in the diaphragm.\n\nWhen Cuso appeared, the lieutenant stiffened himself to attention\nand almost broke his arm saluting. He and Cuso spoke together in a\nsing-song dialect that Zen did not pretend to understand. As they\ntalked, the lieutenant continued to point at West. A grin broke out on\nCuso's face. He beckoned the craggy man to him.\n\nThe craggy man approached, but did not salute. Prisoners were not\npermitted to salute. Nor did he get down on his hands and knees,\nwhich was not only permitted but required among the Asians. West stood\narrow-straight.\n\nIn spite of his disagreements with him, Zen felt proud of Sam West\nnow. Cuso was grinning placatingly but in spite of the grin, West\nsurely knew that he was looking at death, that the slightest show of\nresistance on his part would have only one result, although Cuso might\nsave him until he had wrung all possible information out of him. Zen\ndid not in the least doubt that information was what the Asian wanted\nfirst. After that, there was the tradition of torturing helpless\nprisoners.\n\n\"I have heard much about you,\" Cuso said. For an Asian, he spoke fair\nEnglish.\n\n\"I am greatly honored,\" West answered. \"However, I am curious as to how\nyou heard about me.\"\n\nA sly grin flitted across the Asian's face. \"We 'ave our sources of\ninformation.\"\n\n\"Spies?\" West asked.\n\n\"We 'ave spies, of course, but they could not find out much about you.\nThere are other ways--how do you say it?\"\n\n\"Clairvoyants?\" West asked.\n\n\"Yes, that is right.\" Cuso looked pleased to be given the right word.\nHe also looked startled because he had been given the right fact.\nZen, listening, was surprised too. He knew that the suggestion to use\nclairvoyants to find out what the enemy was doing had often been made.\nAs an intelligence officer, he had investigated several clairvoyants\nwho had volunteered for this purpose. He knew that such a project had\nbeen set up but he did not know what the results had been, if any.\nHowever, to learn that the enemy had not only entertained the same\nideas, but had used them with some success, startled him.\n\n\"I suspected clairvoyants,\" West said.\n\n\"Ah,\" Cuso said. \"Did you also suspect that the only reason this\nairborne landing was made on these shores was to capture you?\"\n\nEven West's perfect control of his features could not hide the start of\nsurprise at these words. \"I am not that important,\" he said.\n\nCuso smiled deprecatingly and made a little gesture with his hand which\nsaid that such modesty was becoming in the truly great. Oddly, Zen had\nthe impression that the Asian leader meant this. \"As to that, I have\nthe great privilege of offering you a commission as a field marshal in\nthe armies of United Asia.\" His voice dripped oil and awe, oil because\nhe was selling, awe because he was truly impressed by the rank of field\nmarshal. Perhaps as a result of the successful achievement of this\ndifficult mission, even he might have this rank. Hunger thickened on\nCuso's face as he thought of this.\n\nWest blinked, then smiled back at Cuso. \"That is interesting. But what\nmakes you think I would be interested in such a commission--or in any\ncommission--in your armies?\"\n\n\"For protection, for one reason,\" Cuso answered promptly. \"Our reports\nindicate that you are not a citizen of any country. Since this leaves\nyou with no friends to protect you, this is an undesirable position. On\nthe other hand, since you belong to no one, every country feels that\nyou are an enemy. Because of this, your life is constantly in danger.\nHowever, holding our commission, you are automatically a citizen of\nUnited Asia, and thus are under our protection.\"\n\nCuso spoke as if being a citizen of United Asia was important and that\nholding a commission in its armies was even more so.\n\n\"Do you think I have no friends?\" West asked.\n\n\"Well, you are not a citizen of--\"\n\n\"Why do you think I need protection?\" West continued.\n\nThe oily smile slid off of the giant Asian's face. For an instant,\nthe wild beast underneath showed through. \"Perhaps you do not need\nprotection personally. But under the circumstances as I have outlined\nthem, our mantle would automatically extend to the people working with\nyou.\" His eyes went around the room to the youths standing rigidly\nagainst the wall. In this circuit, his gaze flicked contemptuously past\nthe corpses lying on the floor.\n\nThe face of the craggy man got bleak again. He understood only too well\nwhat lay back of Cuso's words. \"I see what you mean. But what do you\nwish of me?\" His voice carried an intimation of surrender in the face\nof odds that he recognized as being hopeless.\n\nZen, with his back to the wall, tried to keep from squirming. Emotions\nthat were causing actual pain were in his body. Why would the race mind\npermit such an outrage as this?\n\nThe smile on Cuso's face went from ear to ear. Here was victory, here\nwas the submission of the enemy. Here was what his leaders wanted. Here\nwas a marshal's baton for him.\n\n\"Really very little.\" He drew in his breath with a hiss as he addressed\nWest, a sign of deferent politeness. \"Merely that you show us what\nyou have here. And, of course, that you should explain it all to our\nscientists and engineers, showing them how your equipment operates.\"\n\nThe room got very quiet after Cuso had finished speaking. West seemed\nto muse. \"What do you think we have here?\" he said.\n\n\"If I knew the answer to that question, I would not be asking such a\nstupid thing,\" Cuso answered.\n\n\"Quite true,\" West agreed. \"I was stupid to even ask such a question.\"\n\n\"The time is here to end stupidity,\" Cuso said.\n\n\"Again I agree,\" the craggy man answered. He shrugged. \"Well, when and\nwhere do you want me to start?\" The smile on his face was a mixture of\nfear and resignation. It indicated that he had given up completely.\n\n\"Now you are talking the kind of words I like to hear,\" Cuso said\nemphatically. \"You will start now, and show me, personally, everything\nthat is of importance in this mountain.\"\n\n\"Very well. Follow me.\" West turned and moved toward the opening that\nled to the chamber where the super radar was hidden.\n\n\"Wait here,\" Cuso snapped at his lieutenant. \"Shoot any person who\nmoves.\"\n\n\"Yes, great one,\" the lieutenant answered, saluting. This was the kind\nof order he loved to obey.\n\nCuso and West went out of sight.\n\nJake, Cal, and Ed stood in the middle of the room. Ed approached the\nlieutenant, nodded toward Nedra, and spoke earnestly to the man.\nThe lieutenant shook his head vigorously, a gesture which seemed to\nindicate that Ed was being very stupid. The bantam grumbled to himself\nand moved away. Out of the corners of his eyes he kept watching the\nnurse.\n\nNedra ignored him. She also ignored Kurt Zen. As silent as so many\nstatues, the new people stood against the stone walls. They seemed\nstunned. The impossible had happened to them and they were having\ndifficulty in adjusting to it. John was not in the room. Either he had\nsucceeded in hiding or he had been killed.\n\nThe fat youth was standing directly across the gallery from Zen.\nFarther down the wall, clad in pants and a bra, was a shapely blonde.\nWhen he was not watching Nedra, Ed paid attention to her. His actions\nseemed to irritate the lieutenant. Lifting his rifle, he fired a single\nshot through the head of the bantam.\n\nEd collapsed, dead before he hit the floor. Two Asian soldiers carried\nthe body away.\n\n\"That lieutenant is hell on lovers,\" Zen whispered.\n\nNedra did not answer him. Her face was pale and her breathing was\nshallow. A film of sweat glistened on her forehead. Glancing at her,\nZen had the impression that she was listening.\n\nFor what? he wondered. The only thing that was left for any of them\nwas the sounding of the trump of doom. Zen had no illusions that Cuso\nwould keep his promises for any longer than was expedient. First,\nWest and all the others must be pumped dry of information, the whole\ninterior of the mountain must be thoroughly explored, then--more bodies\nfor the deep hole.\n\nZen had no illusions that either West or the new people would long\nsurvive the information they could be forced to divulge. As to Cuso's\ntalk of West being given a commission as a marshal of the Asian\nFederation, for protection, the colonel knew that Asian field marshals\nhad been listed among the missing before now. A field marshal who fell\nfrom grace vanished.\n\nAcross the gallery the fat youth also vanished.\n\nOne second he was there, the next second he was--gone!\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nNeither the lieutenant nor any of the Asians noticed that a man had\nvanished. Cal and Jake, with the memory of Ed's death still very fresh\nin their minds, were engaged in making themselves inconspicuous. As far\nas Zen could tell, none of these clean, tall kids knew anything out of\nthe ordinary had happened.\n\nBeside the colonel, Nedra seemed slightly more composed. Her eyes were\nblank as if she were not seeing. The thin film of moisture was still\nvisible on her forehead. Zen started to whisper to her, to ask her if\nshe had noticed anything different, then changed his mind. There was no\npoint in taking such a risk at such a time.\n\nA sound was in the room, a thin, high note that was close to the upper\nlimits of hearing. It passed beyond the range of hearing, or diminished\nin volume, then came again with the frequency of the ears, moving like\na microscopically small but very powerful honey bee. Had the sound been\npresent all the time? Or had it come into existence just before the fat\nyouth vanished? Zen did not know about the sound.\n\nA face appeared in the middle of the room. About ten feet above the\nfloor, it looked around briefly, then vanished.\n\nCal seemed to see it too. A startled expression appeared on the face of\nthe ragged man. His eyes opened wide. He blinked them hastily when the\nface vanished, then looked furtively around the room.\n\nJake said, very loudly, to the face, \"Hi, bud. Long time no see. Where\nyou been?\"\n\n\"Shut up your crazy head!\" Cal snarled at him.\n\n\"But I just saw an old buddy,\" Jake tried to explain.\n\n\"You saw nothing.\"\n\n\"What are you two talking about?\" the lieutenant demanded.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Cal answered. He pointed his finger at his forehead and made\ncircling motions in the air, then nodded toward Jake. \"You know he's a\nlooney, lieutenant.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" the Asian officer said, as if he had just remembered\nsomething. Again he lifted the rifle to his shoulder. Jake fell dead.\n\nThe lieutenant slid another cartridge into his rifle.\n\n\"As long as you needed us--\" Cal began.\n\n\"But I no longer need you to help me find the hidden ones,\" the\nlieutenant answered. \"That makes things different, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"It sure does,\" Cal agreed. \"But why did you shoot him?\"\n\n\"I made up my mind months ago to shoot him as soon as I no longer\nneeded him,\" the Asian officer answered. \"He was too crazy to trust.\"\n\n\"But he found this place for you and he got you past those hell\ngenerators,\" Cal said.\n\n\"That is true. But the place is now found and we are past the odd\ndevices that make weaklings afraid.\" His tone said that this also made\nthe situation different and that the ragged man had better understand\nthis and guide himself accordingly. Cal started to speak, then changed\nhis mind.\n\n\"What were you two talking about?\" the Asian asked.\n\n\"He said he saw a face in the air,\" the ragged man answered. \"I told\nhim that he was nuts and to shut up.\"\n\n\"Was there a face?\"\n\n\"I didn't see nothing,\" Cal answered.\n\nWhile the two were talking, Zen was watching a youth in a loin cloth\nacross the room. Standing erect against the wall, looking as if he were\nbeing crucified there, but without making any sound, the youth was\nslowly vanishing.\n\nWhile the youth was sliding away, the violin note throbbed softly in\nthe air. As he vanished, it went into silence, ending on a note of\ntriumph.\n\nThe lieutenant became suspicious. He scanned the people against the\nwall.\n\n\"I thought there were more--\" he muttered. Slowly he counted them.\n\"Thirty-eight,\" he said. As if to engrave the number on his memory, he\nrepeated it.\n\nSimultaneously, one of the Asian soldiers spoke to him in a swift flow\nof sound.\n\nZen could not understand what was being said, but he guessed from the\nway the soldier pointed to the spot where the fat youth had stood that\nhe was reporting what he had seen happen.\n\nWhile they were talking the face appeared again in the air high in\nthe middle of the room. The face was that of a man. He was wearing a\nmustache and he looked around the room with alert brown eyes. Nodding\nto himself with apparent satisfaction, he vanished.\n\nDown the wall from Zen, a young woman vanished.\n\nShe went rapidly, in the flicker of an eye.\n\nA youth standing next in line to her, followed suit.\n\nTurning, the lieutenant saw that something had happened. Hastily he\ncounted those standing against the wall.\n\n\"Thirty-six! Who slipped out while my back was turned?\"\n\nAs he asked the question, three of the new people vanished behind him.\nNo one answered him. He turned again, and realized that more blank\nplaces had appeared while he was not looking.\n\nAgain, keeping behind him, another one of the new people vanished.\n\nWatching, Zen was treated to the spectacle of seeing an Asian officer\ngrow crazy. While the lieutenant was watching one particular person,\nnothing happened to the one under his scrutiny. But directly behind him\na person flicked out of existence.\n\nFor a time, the lieutenant almost had Zen's sympathy. The colonel knew\nwhat would happen to this officer when Cuso returned and found his prey\nhad been permitted to escape. The Asians were not known for leniency to\ntheir own men who failed an assigned duty.\n\nThe lieutenant knew as well as Zen what would happen to him. But he was\nhelpless. No matter which way he looked, his back was always turned to\nsomeone. The person he was not watching--vanished.\n\nUnnoticed by the lieutenant, the face that seemed to be directing the\nvanishing operation appeared and disappeared in the center of the room.\nIt kept directly above the lieutenant's head, moving as he moved,\nvanishing as he looked up.\n\nThe note of the violin came into hearing and went out again, repeating\nthis action time and time again.\n\nSweat dripped off Zen's chin and formed a puddle on the floor under\nhim. He did not know what was happening. Terror that was close to panic\nwas in him but he did not move a muscle. For all he knew, the face\nmight look at him and he might be the next one to vanish.\n\nWhere would he find himself if he vanished? _Would_ he find himself\nagain? Or did these people slide forever into nothingness, into some\ndimensional interspace where there was no Earth, no moon, and no stars?\n\nOnly he and Nedra were left along the walls.\n\nThe others had vanished.\n\nThe lieutenant had gone completely crazy. Sputtering a mixture of\nChinese and English, he was jabbing his rifle against Nedra's stomach\nand was yelling at her.\n\n\"_Tze!_ Go away. I will kill you if you do. _N-oten._ Where did they\ngo? I demand an answer. Speak!\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" the girl answered.\n\n\"Speak! I command it. Cuso will have my throat slit if I let all of you\nget away!\"\n\n\"I have already--\"\n\nThe lieutenant jabbed the muzzle of his rifle against her stomach.\n\n\"If you go away, I will kill you.\"\n\nHe meant what he said.\n\nSmiling at him, the girl vanished.\n\nHe pulled the trigger of the weapon. The bullets howled madly through\nthe gallery. Zen dropped hastily to the floor. Death was too close for\nhim to be amazed at the sight of an Asian officer shooting at nothing.\n\nThe lieutenant stopped shooting when the magazine was empty. As he\nclicked another clip into place, some measure of sanity seemed to\nreturn to him. He did not shoot the colonel.\n\nInstead Zen found himself being prodded with the muzzle of the still\nhot and smoking rifle.\n\n\"If you go away--\"\n\nZen got to his feet.\n\n\"If I knew how to do it, I'd be gone,\" he said.\n\n\"Where did they go? How did they do it?\" Fine flecks of spittle were\nblown from the lieutenant's lips.\n\nThe sound of hot lead was still strong in Zen's ears. At any moment,\nthe lieutenant might start shooting again, for any reason. Or for no\nreason.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Zen said.\n\n\"But you've got to know. You're one of them.\"\n\n\"Would I stand around here and let you shoot me if I was one of them?\"\nZen answered.\n\nSome of the logic of the question must have penetrated to the officer's\nmad mind. \"No. No, you wouldn't. That is, I guess you wouldn't. But you\nmight be trying to trick me.\" The thought of being tricked seemed to\nbring all his fury to the surface. \"You did it once before, you and the\ngirl.\"\n\n\"How?\" Zen demanded.\n\n\"You put us all to sleep, you and that girl? Don't tell me you didn't.\nI was there.\"\n\n\"I was there but I didn't have a damned thing to do with it. And\nneither did the girl.\"\n\n\"Then who did?\"\n\n\"West. He was outside with some kind of a sleep generator that operated\nelectronically.\"\n\nDoubt came over the lieutenant's face. How was he to know if this tall,\nthin yankee was telling the truth. In his book, all Americans were\nliars. Why trust this one?\n\n\"If you lie to me--\"\n\n\"I know. You'll shoot me. And I'll return from the other world and\nstrangle you some night, while you sleep.\"\n\nThe shot went home. Like most Asians, this officer was superstitious.\nWatching the reaction, Zen wondered if this man would ever again dare\nto go to sleep at night. The deadly _dugphas_, the devil souls of the\ndeparted, might strangle him in a spirit noose the instant he closed\nhis eyes.\n\nOn the other hand, there was Cuso. The lieutenant _knew_ what the Asian\nleader would do to him. Zen could see him making up his mind that\nit was better to take a chance on the deadly devils that roam the\ndarkness than on Cuso. The night devils might miss.\n\n\"You lie!\" The lieutenant lifted the rifle.\n\nAt the same instant, Cuso and West entered. The lieutenant lowered the\nrifle. Hastily he approached his chief and saluted. Then, taking as few\nchances as possible, he prostrated himself on the floor. Reaching for\nCuso's foot, he tried to place it on his neck as a token of submission.\n\nCuso kicked him in the face. The Asian leader's eyes ranged the room.\nHe saw instantly that his prisoners were missing. His eyes turned\ngreen. He kicked the lieutenant in the face again and demanded to know\nwhat had happened.\n\nThe luckless officer broke into a stream of tight, sing-song language.\nNow and then he waved his hand as if to say that they had been here but\nhad gone away. \"The _dugphas_ took them,\" he screamed in English.\n\nCuso kicked him in the throat this time. He had no belief in night\ndevils, he did not think they could spirit live people away, and he was\nnot afraid of them.\n\nAnother burst of broken, impassioned speech came from the lieutenant's\nlips. Listening to the sound, watching the contortions in the officer's\nbody, Zen thought with some satisfaction that Ed and Jake were being\navenged. Not that they deserved vengeance; they had gotten exactly what\nwas coming to them.\n\nWest remained aloof. He glanced around the room but no flicker of\nsurprise showed on his face. Did he know what had happened here? Cuso,\nlistening to his lieutenant, glanced once at the craggy man, a look\nthat was pure suspicious hatred. If it had been possible, Cuso would\nhave had West skinned alive then and there.\n\nToo much was at stake for that. A flayed man could not reveal his\nsecrets. He could only die.\n\nCuso left off kicking his lieutenant and trying to listen to him at the\nsame time. He turned to West.\n\n\"It seems that your people have--departed,\" he said.\n\n\"At least, they do not seem to be here,\" the craggy man answered. Again\nhis voice had the deep boom of a bell in it.\n\n\"That is interesting,\" Cuso said.\n\n\"I find it so,\" West answered.\n\n\"How was it done?\"\n\nWest spread his hands in a gesture that said something, or nothing.\n\"Perhaps it would be best to ask them.\"\n\n\"You know.\" The words were a statement, not a question.\n\n\"It could be,\" West answered.\n\n\"Then how?\" Cuso's words sounded like the snap of a bear trap closing.\n\"I want to know how it was done. No alibis. No evasions. No excuses.\nJust the truth.\" The tone of his voice carried the threat of violence\nwith it.\n\nWest smiled. \"Have I alibied or evaded? Did you not see everything in\nour center here?\"\n\n\"I saw many things. That I saw all I do not know.\"\n\n\"You saw what the colonel here--\" the craggy man nodded toward Zen,\n\"--called my super radar.\"\n\n\"Did you show him that?\" Zen demanded.\n\n\"Of course. I have no secrets from the great Asian. Besides, has he not\npromised me a commission as a marshal in the armed forces of his land?\"\n\nThe words were easily spoken but Zen knew that West was actually\nstalling for time. What was he waiting for? Was it the appearance again\nof the face that had looked from the air in the center of the room?\nWere the vanished people to reappear, armed with new weapons, and take\nthe Asians prisoners?\n\n\"To hell with his commission!\" Zen shouted. \"He'll never make good on\nhis promise.\"\n\n\"Shut up, both of you!\" Cuso shouted. His voice was a bull bellow of\nsound that roared back from the walls of the gallery and was echoed\nfrom the tunnels that led outward. \"You are stalling. You are trying to\ntrick me.\"\n\nWest was silent.\n\n\"My dog here says the people vanished.\" Cuso kicked his lieutenant\nagain to indicate who was meant. \"Howl, dog!\"\n\nThe lieutenant obeyed. He was in such a state of mind that if Cuso had\ntold him to die, he would probably have obeyed, as a result of terror\nand suggestion.\n\n\"Do you want to howl like a dog too?\" Cuso said to West.\n\n\"Really, the possibility does not concern me,\" the craggy man answered.\n\"Did you have that in mind for me?\" The tone was conversational.\n\n\"West, this is no time to go over,\" Zen growled.\n\n\"I have no such intention, colonel.\"\n\n\"You admitted once that what you wanted most to do was to join the\nbronze youth. I'm asking you--\"\n\n\"_Shut up!_\" Cuso screamed. \"The next person to open his mouth without\nmy permission I will have shot out of hand.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" West said.\n\nThe Asian leader started to shout an order at his soldiers to shoot the\ncraggy man, then changed his mind as he realized that even though he\nhad the weapons and the men, there was nothing he could gain by killing\nthe goose that might possibly lay a golden egg. As much as he wanted to\nhave West killed, for defying him, he knew he would have to save this\npleasure until later.\n\nCuso swallowed his anger. Since his rage was so great, he had to\nswallow several times before he got it all down, after which he looked\nas if he were going to choke on it.\n\n\"Look, let's be reasonable,\" he urged.\n\n\"I'm willing,\" Zen said.\n\n\"You're not worth a damn to me!\" Cuso shouted.\n\n\"He is worth something to me,\" West interposed.\n\nAgain the Asian swallowed. If ever he reached the explosion point, his\nanger was going to come out as boiling rage. \"As I said, let us be\nreasonable and talk this over together.\"\n\n\"Glad to,\" West agreed. \"What is more reasonable than a corpse?\"\n\nThe question took Cuso aback. But only for an instant. \"Come to think\nof it, you're right. Nothing that I have ever seen is more agreeable\nthan a corpse, to me, that is. Are you still determined to volunteer\nfor that position, or should I say _condition_?\"\n\n\"Any time,\" West answered. \"As I told Kurt some time ago, I am rather\ntired of this plane of existence and I would like to see what it's like\nover yonder. Not that I don't already know,\" he added.\n\n\"You know what it's like beyond death?\" Cuso asked, curious in spite of\nhimself.\n\n\"Certainly,\" West said, in a sure tone of voice.\n\nListening, Zen again had the impression that the craggy man was\nstalling for time again. On the other hand, he might be telling the\nliteral truth, he might know what waited at the end of life. If so--Zen\nlet this possibility slide hastily out of his mind. He had more to\nthink about now than he had brain cells to use for the task.\n\n\"Then what is it like?\" Cuso asked.\n\n\"You have heard of heaven--\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That's where I'm going.\"\n\nAs he spoke, West vanished.\n\nA stunned silence held the big gallery. Cuso, his mouth hanging open,\nstood leaning forward. On the floor, the lieutenant dared to sit up. He\neven dared to speak.\n\n\"See! That's the way they went. I couldn't stop 'em.\"\n\nCuso shouted an order at his men.\n\nZen found himself tied hand and foot. A raging maniac paced the floor\nbeside him. Every now and then Cuso kicked him. Screaming at the top of\nhis voice, the Asian leader invited Zen to vanish too. It did Zen no\ngood to try to protest that he was not one of the new people and that\nhe knew nothing of the method they had used in disappearing.\n\nIn Cuso's mind, he was one of them.\n\nHe was to be treated as such.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nAt first, the lighted matches under his toe nails hurt like the very\ndevil. He had never known such pain. Then he forgot about the matches\nunder his toe nails. They started lighting them under his fingers.\n\n\"Where did they go?\" Cuso screamed. \"How did they do it?\"\n\nZen had long since ceased trying to say that he didn't know. Instead of\nspeaking, he shook his head. This was all he could do. Cuso interpreted\nthe head shake as a stubborn refusal to answer. He kicked the colonel\nin the face.\n\nAt the kick, the race mind clicked in. This was the effect Zen had--as\nif a third person had suddenly come in on a party line. After that,\nthe pain from the kick did not seem so important. The torture from the\nmatches under his nails seemed to diminish also.\n\nNot that the contact with the race mind nullified the pain or made it\nany less real. Fire was still fire and torture was still the same. But\nneither were very important.\n\nOther things were.\n\nZen tried to concentrate his attention on the other things. The room,\nthe shouting Cuso, the two Asians who were holding him down while\nthe third thrust the matches under his nails, the shivering Cal, the\nlieutenant who was over-eager to obey his leader's orders, all these\nseemed to become misty and vague. These things were real; there was no\nquestion about that. But his mind was contacting another reality which\nmade these things different. Time began to lose its meaning.\n\nHe wondered if he was fainting. Another question came across his\nthoughts, heeled over like a sailing ship moving across the wind. Was\nhe dying?\n\nThere was no shock with the thought. If that was the way it was, then\nhe was more than ready.\n\n\"You are not fainting and you are not dying,\" the race mind whispered\nto him. \"Come closer to me.\"\n\n\"How do I come closer to you?\"\n\n\"Let go.\" The voice of the race mind was like a whisper from the other\nside of infinity. \"Let go and come to me.\"\n\nDimly, he wondered how one let go. The answer came with the question.\nThe words meant exactly what they said, the meaning was literal--_let\ngo_.\n\nAs he performed the action that went with the words, the big gallery,\nCuso, the lieutenant, and the torturers faded away and became a part\nof a misty world that seemed to have no real existence. Even the pain\nvanished.\n\n\"Come to me,\" the race mind whispered, again and again, a luring voice\nthat drew him irresistibly.\n\nAbruptly, he was back in the gallery. He did not know how long he had\nbeen gone but he realized that some time must have passed, enough to\nallow them to set up a portable radio transmitter in the gallery. The\nset looked to be very powerful. A yellow-skinned operator was huddling\nover the controls.\n\n\"In contact with Asian headquarters,\" Zen thought. He knew his thinking\nwas correct.\n\nOff somewhere in the distance outside the mountain the night shuddered.\nHe knew the meaning of the sound. A rocket ship was either landing or\nblasting off, probably the latter. A long line of burdened Asians was\nmoving through the gallery.\n\nAt the sight of their loads Zen knew what had gone into the hold of\nthat ship. The equipment of the hidden center here. He saw parts of the\nsuper radar go past on the backs of sweating Asian soldiers, and he\nknew where this was going.\n\nAt this knowledge, anguish came up in him. With West's super radar in\ntheir possession, no American secret was safe from prying Asian eyes,\nunless some way could be found to shield the frequencies employed.\n\nSuch shielding might work for laboratories, but there was no way to\nshield troop movements and take-offs and landings. These would be as\npublic as an advertisement.\n\nHis face was wet. He could not understand this until another bucket of\nwater hit him. An Asian bent over him, saw that his eyes were open, and\ngrunted with satisfaction. They started again on his fingers.\n\nThe radio operator called to Cuso, giving him a message. Zen could not\nunderstand the language but the Asian leader was both startled and\nelated. He shouted at the men carrying loads to work faster.\n\n\"Not much time left. Big bomb coming.\"\n\n\"What bomb?\" Zen thought. With the question came the answer. Warned\nby Cuso that their preparations were probably known, the Asians had\ndecided to launch their super bomb immediately. Turmoil came up inside\nZen at this knowledge.\n\nReal pain came from his finger tips as the torturers began operations\nagain.\n\n\"Do you want to die?\" the race mind whispered in his thoughts.\n\nAlthough he couldn't contact it, the race field could reach him. \"You\nhave suffered all that is required. You have met the law. You may join\nme, if you wish.\"\n\n\"I--\" Zen shut off his thinking. This was fantasy, the product of\ntorture and nearing dissolution. His own imagination was tricking him,\nhe thought.\n\n\"This is not your imagination,\" the answer came. \"This is what you call\nthe race mind.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"How do you know? You don't. At this point, you have to accept me on\nfaith.\" The thinking flowing smoothly into his mind went into silence,\nthen came again, stronger than before. \"Do you want to die? You have\nearned the right.\"\n\n\"No,\" Zen answered. He screamed the words again. \"No. No!\"\n\n\"The path before you will be difficult.\"\n\n\"I don't care how difficult it is. There's work to be done!\" Again he\nshouted the words.\n\n\"Very well. It is your choice. You may remain among the living for as\nlong as your strength may last.\" The voice whispering in his mind went\ninto silence.\n\nKurt continued screaming. Pain raced through his consciousness again.\nAs he came awake he realized that he was screaming at the torturer to\nstop.\n\nHe also realized that the Asian had stopped. There was a sound in the\ngallery. Filling the air, it seemed to emerge from the very walls of\nthe mountain itself.\n\nThe note of a violin!\n\nHigh and sweet and compelling, the sound came from nowhere. Every atom\nin the solid stone walls seemed to pick it up and to rebroadcast it.\nThe molecules of the air seemed to dance in resonance with it.\n\nSimultaneously, about ten feet above the floor, the face appeared again.\n\nThe lieutenant's rifle blasted at it. He fired shot after shot at point\nblank range. Red-hot slugs howled from the walls of the big gallery in\na cacophony of death.\n\nThe face smiled at the lieutenant. The lips moved. \"Keep shooting, old\nfellow,\" the lips seemed to say.\n\nThe officer emptied his gun. In a desperate burst of fear, he threw it\nat the mocking face.\n\nThe weapon passed through the face without harming it.\n\n\"You fool! That's a projection, not a real person!\" Cuso shouted. He\ngrabbed the officer by the shoulder and spun him backward to the floor.\n\"Who are you?\" he demanded of the face.\n\nIt smiled at him.\n\nZen repressed the impulse to shout. He knew what was going to happen\nnext.\n\n\"I said, _Who are you?_\" Cuso shouted again.\n\nThe crash of something in the gallery jerked his attention away.\nTwisting his head around, he saw that one of the soldiers engaged in\ncarrying the loot of this cavern out to the plane waiting to hurry it\nto Asia, had collapsed on the floor.\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances, Cuso would have had the man summarily\nexecuted. But with that face smiling at him out of nothing, these\ncircumstances were not ordinary.\n\nZen, knowing what was going to happen, forgot the pain of his burned\nfingers and toes. He could feel it creeping over him in waves. This\ntime he did not resist it: He let his eyes close.\n\nWhen he opened them, the torturer was snoring beside him. Every Asian\nin the big gallery was sound asleep.\n\nPeople were crowding around him. The new people. In a sweeping glance,\nhe recognized every person he had met here, except Nedra, and he did\nnot see her at first because she was busy bandaging his hands. West was\nsmiling down at him with an expression that was somehow grandfatherly.\nBut back of West's smile was perturbation.\n\nZen started to get to his feet and discovered they had not as yet\nremoved the ropes from his legs. As one did this, Nedra clucked\nreprovingly at him and tried to tell him that he was wounded. He said\nthis did not matter. Faces were here that he did not recognize. This\ndid not matter either.\n\n\"You did this?\" he said to West.\n\n\"Yes. I designed and built the equipment. Others were operating it in\nthis instance.\" West had something else on his mind.\n\n\"Thanks,\" Zen said. \"Why didn't you take me with you when you\nwent--wherever it was you went?\"\n\n\"We couldn't,\" West answered. \"You haven't had the training.\"\n\n\"Why did you come back?\"\n\n\"To rescue you. Kurt--\" West had something that he wanted to say.\n\n\"Nedra, will you stop fussing with me? I'm all right.\"\n\n\"But your poor hands and feet.\"\n\n\"I don't even feel them. I won't have them to feel at all unless action\nis taken. Don't you understand. Somewhere in Asia they're getting ready\nto launch a super bomb. Or maybe it's already on its way.\"\n\n\"I didn't know,\" the girl said. \"The big one?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nA flicker of pain crossed her face and she shook her head. \"I always\nwondered what it would be like to live on a mud flat. I wonder if we\nwill be oysters, or eels. Or maybe crabs.\"\n\n\"What the hell are you talking about?\" Zen demanded.\n\n\"After the bomb goes off,\" the girl said.\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"The race mind will have to start over again,\" she explained. Her\nmanner indicated that she was explaining something that she clearly\nunderstood. She seemed to wonder why he did not understand it. \"Maybe\nwe will be turtles? That will be funny! A turtle that can remember when\nit was a man! That's the way it will be. Except--\"\n\n\"I know all about that.\"\n\n\"Except that the turtle won't be able to do anything about its\nmemories,\" the girl continued as if she had not heard him. \"It will\nhave flippers and a beak but what it will need will be hands. It won't\nhave them until it grows them itself. A turtle with the memories that\nit was once a man, knowing that if it had hands, it could rebuild human\nculture!\" A bemused expression appeared on her face. \"I wonder how the\nrace mind will solve that problem.\" Again she seemed to muse. \"It would\nbe worse to be crabs. Or would it?\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" Zen snarled. \"We're not turtles yet. Or crabs. And we're not\nback on the mud flats.\"\n\n\"But we're on the edge of them,\" the girl insisted. \"One more teeter\nand we will go totter.\"\n\nZen turned to West. \"What the hell has happened to Nedra?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" the craggy man answered. \"She has some degree of\nclairvoyance and it is coming to consciousness. Unfortunately, she has\nnot yet had time to develop her talents in that direction.\"\n\n\"Maybe the turtle wouldn't want to rebuild human culture,\" the girl\ninterrupted. \"Maybe it wouldn't want to go back down that blind alley\nagain. Perhaps it would decide to go into another channel, to develop\ninto something totally different. In that case, it might not need\nhands.\"\n\nZen deliberately ignored her. He turned to West. \"A bomb will be going\noff,\" he said.\n\n\"That is what I've been trying to talk to you about,\" the craggy man\nanswered. \"This is another reason why we came back for you--so we could\ntalk to you about that bomb.\"\n\n\"To me?\" Zen said startled.\n\n\"Yes, to you.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you are a colonel of intelligence and have experience in such\nmatters. Also because you are something that none of us are--a fighting\nman.\"\n\n\"I--I don't understand you,\" Zen answered.\n\n\"I can get you there. But once there, my knowledge fails. I, to my\nregret, know nothing of fighting.\" West spread his hands in a helpless\ngesture.\n\n\"Get me where?\" Zen asked.\n\n\"To Asia. To the underground cavern where they are getting ready to\nlaunch that bomb,\" West explained. The tone of his voice said this was\neasy. The hard part came in knowing what to do, and being able to do\nit, after they were there.\n\n\"To Asia?\" Zen parroted the words. He had the dazed impression that\nthis whole scene was unreal, that the snoring Asians on the floor, Cal\nhuddled by the wall, and the new people crowding into the room, would\nshortly all vanish in puffs of green smoke. \"How in the hell will you\nget us to Asia?\"\n\n\"How did we get out of this gallery?\" West responded. \"How did we\nvanish? How did the men in the reports you read get into the planes\nthat were about to crash? Who landed Colonel Grant's space satellite?\nWho steered it? Who provided the power to energize the motion? Who--\"\n\n\"Did you know I knew about Grant?\"\n\n\"It was obvious that you must know.\"\n\n\"And you can get me to Asia?\"\n\n\"You and as many others as you choose to take with you!\"\n\nWalking over to the sleeping lieutenant, he picked up the man's rifle,\nthen turned to the group.\n\n\"Who will go with me to Asia?\" he asked.\n\nThe group stepped forward as one man.\n\nA knot formed in Kurt Zen's throat at the sight and he gulped to force\nit down. He knew how much this decision meant to them. They had been\ntrained in the ways of peace, they were searching for the road to the\nfuture. Fighting meant turning backward on the path that led to growth,\nit was the last thing they wanted to do. Yet do it they would, if it\nwas necessary. In an instant they were scrambling for weapons from the\nsleeping Asians, then they were trying to salute and tell him their\nnames and say they would follow him at the same time.\n\nOne man saluted well. \"Red-Dog Jimmie Thurman,\" he said. Pride was in\nthe man's voice.\n\nZen caught the man's arm. \"Red-Dog Jimmie Thurman? But I know you.\"\n\n\"Maybe you do, suh.\" Thurman spoke with the soft drawl of the old south.\n\n\"One of the new people appeared in your plane and saved your life!\" Zen\nburst out.\n\n\"Yes, suh. That's right, suh.\"\n\n\"But you deserted!\"\n\n\"Put it another way, suh, let's say I joined the right side.\"\n\n\"How did you find this place?\"\n\n\"I just kept thinking and kept trying. Eventually we found each other.\nThe psychos tried to make me believe I was nuts. But I knew better. I\nknew what had happened. And I knew there had to be a reason for it. I\nkept hunting until I found that reason. The big part of the battle,\nwhere I had an advantage over most everybody else, was that I knew from\nexperience that something was going on. Knowing this much, all I had to\ndo was keep looking.\" The man's voice drawled the explanation. His eyes\nsmiled. \"At your service, suh.\"\n\n\"Do you know that going with me may mean death?\"\n\n\"What's death, suh?\" Red-Dog Jimmie Thurman grinned. \"I died over the\nNorth Pole, suh.\"\n\n\"Spike Larson,\" another man said.\n\n\"You were in a sub,\" Zen challenged. A glow was coming up inside of him\nlike nothing he had ever experienced before. He was getting fighting\nmen to stand beside him.\n\n\"Yes,\" Larson answered. \"And I will consider it a privilege to stand\nbeside you.\"\n\nLike soldiers, they passed in review before him, the fat boy, the\ntall, lean, brown-skinned youths. Somehow he thought there ought to be\nanother one. He looked around for him. Grant was talking to West.\n\nGrant was the man whose face had looked out of thin air in the middle\nof the room.\n\nSeeing that Zen was staring at him, he left off his talk with the\ncraggy man and came over and saluted.\n\n\"How was it up in that satellite?\" Zen asked.\n\n\"Lonely, as hell, colonel,\" Grant answered.\n\n\"Do you want to go with me to Asia?\"\n\n\"There's no place on Earth I'd rather go. And, the way things stand now\nI don't have much choice. If they get that bomb into the air--\" He left\nthe sentence unfinished.\n\nThen Nedra was standing in front of Zen. At the sight of her, it seemed\nto him that the world stood still. He shook his head.\n\n\"Why?\" she challenged.\n\n\"Because I love you,\" he answered.\n\n\"Then that is the real reason why you should take me with you,\" she\nanswered.\n\n\"I don't follow,\" he said.\n\n\"If you fail, there will be no tomorrow,\" she answered. To her, the\nstatement had no answer. \"Besides, I am a nurse,\" she continued. \"If\nthere are wounded, I can help with them.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"The fact that you love me does not enter into this situation. It is\na thing apart. It is a very wonderful thing,\" she added hastily, the\nstar light shining in her eyes. \"And I wish we could bring it to fruit\nthe ways it used to be. But those days are gone. And I am going to Asia\nwith you.\"\n\nWatching, West smiled. Zen spread his hands in a gesture of defeat. He\nturned to the craggy man. \"This sleep thing: I don't know how you do\nit and don't much care, but you obviously have a portable generator of\nsome kind that you used to put the lieutenant out in the ghost town.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" West agreed.\n\n\"I'd like to borrow the unit,\" Zen said.\n\n\"Gladly, colonel. I wish we had other weapons.\"\n\n\"We'll make do with what we have,\" Zen answered.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\n\"Zero minus one hour,\" the loudspeaker droned, in a Chinese dialect.\n\nIn a deep cavern in the hinterlands of Asia, men responded to the\ncommand coming over the speaker system. Already driven to the point of\nexhaustion, they were working harder than they had ever worked before.\nThe moment of victory, for which all true Asians had lived, was near at\nhand. The launching of this bomb would make the Asian Union master of\nthe world. Orders had come through to launch this bomb immediately.\n\n\"Zero minus forty-five minutes,\" the speaker said. The drone had gone\nfrom the voice of the officer watching the time. A rising excitement\nappeared in the tones as if he, too, had caught the scent of fear\nrising in the vast underground depot.\n\nSo much was left to be done. The atomic warhead was already in place,\nwaiting for the day of launching, otherwise the task would have been\nimpossible. The driving engines were complete, but had to be fueled.\nThe steering equipment was almost ready, only the installation of the\nleft gyroscope was necessary. This was at hand waiting to be installed.\nFive technicians constantly got in each other's way as they tried to\nslip the delicate instrument into place.\n\n\"Zero minus thirty minutes!\"\n\nThe gyroscope was eased into place and tested. It was found to be in\nperfect working order.\n\nIn the course plotting room, the final calculations were being made.\nWind direction and velocity aloft had been noted across half the\nplanet. This had some importance on the launching and landing end but\nhad no significance when the bomb itself was out of the atmosphere.\n\nThe target had been figured and refigured. Actually, the target was\nanywhere on the continent of North America. If this bomb struck\nanywhere in the Mississippi valley, the whole watershed below the\nstriking point would be scoured clean of all life. Water carrying\nradiation downstream would account for that.\n\n\"Zero minus fifteen minutes!\"\n\nOn the outside of the mountain, in a special observatory constructed\nfor this precise purpose, radar scopes for tracking the rocket were\nready. Instruments in the laboratory there were for the purpose of\nchanging the course of the super bomb, if it veered too far from its\ndestination. The technicians there were on their toes. They had no\nguards to encourage them but they needed none. They knew what would\nhappen if this bomb failed to land and the fault was traced to their\ndoor.\n\nWhat would happen when the bomb landed?\n\nHell would happen!\n\nProbably the crust of the Earth would open up in a hole miles in depth.\nMeteor Crater, in Arizona, would be the work of a child compared to the\nresult of this explosion. What had happened at Hiroshima and Nagasaki\nwould be nothing in comparison.\n\nThe possibility existed that the molten magma of the core of the planet\nwould gush forth. No one knew for sure whether or not this would\nhappen. If it did take place, the result might be the sudden appearance\nof a lake of over-flowing lava.\n\nThe shock waves from the bomb would probably be strong enough to pull\ndown every skyscraper that still remained standing in America.\n\nThe effect on the watershed where the bomb landed would be almost\ncomplete catastrophe. If it struck on any of the rivers or streams\nflowing into the Mississippi, the water supply of all cities downstream\nto New Orleans would be contaminated.\n\nNobody knew what the effect of the fall-out from this bomb would be.\nHigh air currents might carry radioactive particles for thousands of\nmiles from the explosion point, where they would fall as a gentle but\nvery deadly rain upon the Earth below.\n\n\"_Zero minus ten minutes!_\"\n\nThe high, thin note of a violin appeared in the vast underground\ncavern. Amid the scurrying of feet, the shouts of the foremen bossing\nthe work gangs, and the occasional cracking of the rifles of the guard,\nthe sound was unheard by the ears. But deeper centers heard it.\n\nThe first man to go was a fat engineer. Sighing, he stumbled and fell.\nWhen he did not rise a guard approached him. As the guard determined\nthat the man was snoring, he lifted his rifle.\n\nThe engineer died without awakening.\n\nAnother shot rang out as another man went to sleep, then continued on\nto join his fathers.\n\nThe technician busy filling the fuel tanks of the rocket was the third\nman to go. He managed to finish closing the filler cap and to lay down\nhis flexible line before the urge to sleep overcame him.\n\nBy this time the guards knew that something was wrong.\n\nSilence came over the cavern. In the stillness, the note of the violin\nflickering up and down the scale could be heard. Men looked at each\nother in growing apprehension. Looking, some of them lay down and went\nto sleep.\n\n\"Sleep gas!\" an officer bawled. \"Shoot all foreigners on sight!\"\n\nThe officer suspected that some spy had slipped into the underground\ncavern and had released gas there. His command was intended to enable\nhis men to find and eliminate this alien. As such, from a military\nstandpoint, it was a good command. It had this deficiency: when his men\ndid not find any aliens, but their own people continued going to sleep\non them, they began imagining foreigners. The guards began to shoot\ntheir own technicians and engineers.\n\nAs panic swept through the cavern, guards began to shoot other guards.\nSoon the people in this huge underground chamber were tearing and\ndestroying each other. And one other thing: they were also going to\nsleep.\n\nThe panic grew to hurricane proportions.\n\nWhen Kurt Zen appeared inside the cavern the whole vast place was as\nstill as a tomb. Smoke from the rifles hung in the air, the cavern\nstank of death and fear. But the bomb still rested in its launching\ncradle.\n\nZen took one long look at that bomb. He felt his sigh of relief clear\ndown to the ends of his toes. At the sight, the last remnant of pain\nvanished from his toes and fingers. Not that the damage done by the\nmatches did not still exist. It did. But in the surge of elation that\nswept through him, he completely forgot the pain.\n\n\"We just got here in time,\" a man said, appearing beside him. It was\nSpike Larson who had spoken. Awe on his face, Larson glanced around the\ncavern. \"They started killing each other. They must have gone nuts.\"\n\n\"I don't blame them,\" Zen said. \"I damned near did, on the way here.\"\n\n\"That trip through nothing is sure a stinker, isn't it,\" Larson\nanswered, grinning and shaking his head.\n\nZen agreed with him whole-heartedly. After tuning his body to an\ninstrument in the cavern, hidden so well that Cuso's men had not had\ntime to find it, West had punched a button. The machine had vanished.\nWest had vanished. A horrible moment had come when it had seemed that\nhis feet were standing on nothing more substantial than air. What he\nhad felt under his feet had, in fact, been far less substantial than\nair, which had body. It had been even less solid than space. It had\nbeen _nothing_.\n\nSwishing, colonel Grant came into existence on the other side of Zen.\nGrant looked fussed, but he gripped the rifle he had taken from one of\nCuso's men with determination.\n\n\"Just between you and me, I'd rather fly a space satellite to Mars any\nday in preference to facing this jump.\"\n\n\"I know what you mean,\" Zen said.\n\nAs he spoke, another figure came into existence to his left. Nedra!\nShe came spinning into reality with a smile on her face. Zen wasted a\nmoment wondering what kind of cast-iron nerves this girl had.\n\n\"It looks as if all we have to do is to tie them up,\" Spike Larson\nsaid. \"This is almost too good to be true.\"\n\n\"It is too good to be true,\" Zen said. Turmoil was--somewhere. He did\nnot know where but it seemed to him that a vast uneasiness had suddenly\ncome into existence. It had to do, somehow, with the future, with a\nsomething that was about to happen.\n\n\"Halt!\" Grant's voice rang out.\n\nZen swung his gaze around just in time to see an Asian lift himself to\nhis feet near a control board that stood beside the rocket.\n\n\"He's walking in his sleep,\" Larson exclaimed.\n\n\"_Zero minus one minute_,\" the loudspeaker announced.\n\n\"Where in the hell is that man on the speaker?\" Grant demanded. \"The\nsleep frequency didn't get to him!\"\n\n\"No time to be concerned about him now,\" Zen said. The turmoil that\nexisted somewhere had increased in intensity. Somehow it was concerned\nwith the solitary Asian who was reeling in circles like a drunken man\ntrying to make up his mind.\n\n\"Shall I shoot him, colonel?\" Grant demanded.\n\nZen hesitated. He knew that West's deepest wish was to avoid violence\nif that was possible.\n\nThe split second's delay was fatal. Grant's shot rang out--much too\nlate.\n\nReeling on his feet, the man reached the control panel, and pulled the\nsingle switch there. A heavy thud came from the rocket as a ram drove\nhome inside the heavy metal hull.\n\n\"Get back!\" Zen screamed.\n\nHe caught Nedra and pulled her backward. Beside him, he knew that Grant\nand Larson were also reeling backward. Inside the rocket a steady\nrumble of sound was building up. Low in frequency but heavy in volume\nit seemed to shake the foundations of the Earth itself. Inside the\nvessel heavy heat charges were building up. Smoke and flame spurted\nbackward as the first warming charge let go.\n\nFor all Zen knew this section was to have been cleared before the\nfiring of the first rocket. He did not know whether provision had been\nmade for the elimination of flame and smoke but he knew that heat and\nsmoke hit him as he pulled Nedra away.\n\nThen the main charges let go.\n\nRising like some devil spurting upward from the depths of hell itself,\nthe launching cradle carrying the rocket lurched upward. The stone\nfloor shook underfoot, the mountain shook. Unless this rocket could be\nstopped, the whole planet would shake. Earth would twitch her skin like\nan elephant stung by a giant wasp.\n\nWith a thundering roar the rocket shook itself loose from its cradle\nand hurled into the sky under its own power.\n\n\"West,\" Zen shouted.\n\n\"Yes, Kurt.\" The craggy man's reply was as prompt as it would have been\nif he had stayed in the same room. Actually he was in the American\ncenter.\n\n\"We've lost,\" Zen said.\n\n\"I know,\" West replied. A sadness as deep as the ocean of space was in\nhis voice.\n\n\"Pull these people back to you.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Me last.\" The last lingering roars of sound were still pounding down\nthe bore of the launching cradle.\n\n\"Why do you want to be last?\"\n\n\"Duty,\" Zen said. \"Get that miracle device of yours into operation,\npronto.\"\n\n\"Sure. I'm starting now.\"\n\n\"Hey, guys, you're going home!\" Zen yelled at the people with him.\n\n\"What good is it to go home?\" Spike Larson asked.\n\n\"There won't be any home within an hour,\" Grant added. \"Or however long\nthat rocket will take to land. Why go back to what isn't there?\"\n\n\"That's where we will start the task of rebuilding,\" Zen said.\n\n\"Rebuild what with what?\" Larson demanded.\n\n\"There will be something left,\" Zen said firmly. \"You are already\nunderground. You will stay that way. Keep the good fight going, for\nyears. Raise some kids to keep it going after you are gone.\" He felt\nvery firm and sure about what he was saying.\n\n\"You're full of hot air,\" Red-Dog Jimmie Thurman said.\n\n\"Besides, you are planning something else,\" Nedra spoke. \"You want to\nget rid of us so you can--\"\n\n\"West!\" Zen shouted.\n\n\"Yes, Kurt.\"\n\n\"Take 'em away!\" Zen yelled. \"They're trying to rebel on me. Take Nedra\nfirst before she reads my mind.\"\n\n\"I'm working as fast as I can,\" West answered. \"This instrument has to\nbe tuned to the individual body frequency. Ah--\"\n\n\"I knew there was something--\" Nedra began. And vanished. Zen grinned.\nHe had the impression that she was calling him names that no lady\nshould speak as she went away. Time would cure that, if any time was\nleft. In the chamber an Asian was stirring.\n\n\"Zen, old man, what are you up to?\" Grant asked.\n\n\"Take this one next,\" Kurt ordered. Grant looked reluctant but resigned\nas he disappeared.\n\nZen was alone in the big chamber. Smoke swirled from the ceiling. One\nAsian was already on his feet and a guard was sitting up.\n\n\"I've got them all here,\" West's voice came across vast distances.\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"Are you ready?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Zen answered. \"But I'm going that way.\" He pointed toward the\nceiling.\n\n\"Kurt!\" West's voice was sharp with sudden pain as he caught the\ncolonel's meaning.\n\n\"That way or no way,\" Zen answered.\n\n\"But that's not a passenger rocket.\"\n\n\"The hull will hold enough air to keep me alive for as long as I need\nto be there.\"\n\n\"But the rocket is in constantly accelerating flight. It's a moving\ntarget.\"\n\n\"Red-Dog Jimmie Thurman's plane was falling and Colonel Grant's\nsatellite was moving and Spike Larson's sub was on the bottom of the\nIndian Ocean. Don't give me any back talk, Sam. Somebody got into\nthat plane and that satellite and that submarine. I can get into that\nrocket. You're the man who can put me there.\"\n\n\"But I'm not on that target!\" West's voice had a wail in it.\n\n\"Then get on it!\" Kurt Zen sounded like an exceedingly gruff drill\nsergeant addressing a new recruit, or like a colonel who had his mind\nmade up.\n\n\"All right. I'll do my best. But something will remain here, Kurt, even\nafter the explosion. We'll be safe, in a way, here.\"\n\n\"That argument has already been used, by me, to get the others back to\nyou. You and I know, Sam, that hell won't hold a hat to the American\ncontinent if that whizzer hits.\"\n\n\"All right,\" West repeated. \"Ah! I'm on the rocket as a target.\"\n\n\"Good!\" Zen repressed every muscular tremor everywhere in his body.\n\nSomewhere there was jubilation, a sensed but not tangible vibration\nthat he could not locate. He concentrated on the jubilation.\n\nA layer of smoke floated down from the ceiling like a descending\ndeath-pall. The guard had gotten to his feet. He had picked up his\nrifle and was staring around the room seeking either an explanation for\nwhat had happened, or a target. To him, which he got didn't matter. His\neyes came to focus on the lean colonel with the bandaged fingers. That\nuniform did not belong here.\n\nThe guard raised his rifle.\n\n\"Good luck, Kurt,\" West's voice whispered across the space between two\ncontinents.\n\nAs the gun exploded in his face, Kurt Zen felt his body vibrate into\nwhat seemed to be nothing. Again the terror wrenched at his soul. Again\nhe experienced the mind-compelling agony of this incredible type of\nspace flight.\n\nThis time he did not mind these terrors. Somewhere in his mind was\njubilation. Wondering if it was the forerunner of death, he continued\nto concentrate on that.\n\nDimly, as if from some other space, or some other time, he was aware of\na roar. The rocket swam into existence ten feet away from him. He was\noutside it, in airless space.\n\nWest had made a miscalculation.\n\nAgony seared every cell in his body. Pain clamped at his throat like\nhands trying to choke him to death.\n\n\"Oops! I made a mistake,\" he heard West gasp.\n\nHe was moving with the rocket, on a parallel course. West had matched\ncourse and velocity but he had not achieved his exact aiming point.\nError in the instrument? Human mistake? Who knew?\n\nWho cared?\n\n_Click!_\n\nLike a vast ocean of warm, pulsing, sure power, the race mind came into\nKurt Zen. It existed here in space, too! He had never thought of that.\nIn what little thinking he had had time to do, he had considered it as\na super special sort of field which possessed intelligence but which\nwas limited to the surface of the planet.\n\nHere in space, it sustained life in him.\n\nHe did not know how this was done, this was one of the mysteries which\nmust be left to the future to solve--if there was a future other than\nthe mud flats. It felt to him as if a vast tidal current was flowing\ninto his body.\n\n_Click!_\n\nHe was in the rocket!\n\nThe smell of overheated oil fouled his nose. As he tried to move, he\nbumped his head. He was in a narrow passage. Ahead was a control panel\nwith automatic devices. He began to crawl in that direction.\n\nNoise was a thundering roar in his ears. His whole body felt as if it\nwas about to shake to pieces. The passage was narrow. It had never been\nintended for humans. Moving upward, Zen found it was too narrow. He got\nstuck.\n\nNo matter how hard he tried he could not move an inch forward. The\ncontrol panel was so close he could spit on it but it could not have\nbeen farther out of his reach if it had been on the other side of the\nMoon.\n\nAir was getting short. He twisted and squirmed, fighting like the\ndevil, but his body was wedged into the narrow passage in such a way\nthat he could not move.\n\nSomething pulled at his arms. Nedra was directly ahead of him. She was\ntrying to pull him forward along the passage.\n\n\"You?\" he whispered.\n\n\"Who has a better right than I?\" she answered. Sweat grimed her face.\nHer hair was awry. Fiercely she pulled at him.\n\nThe rocket yawed, beginning its turn in space. He forced himself\nforward. And came free.\n\nSomehow he found the strength to pull himself up in front of the\ncontrol panel. He was running on nervous energy now and he knew it. No\nstrength was left in his body beyond what he was forcing into it.\n\n\"Send it out to space!\" he muttered. \"Send it out there!\" He tried to\nwave his arm in an outward gesture and bumped his hand on the steel\nhull.\n\nLight came through a circular port. He had a glimpse of the Earth down\nbelow. The planet was very far away. Blue seas and green land, the\nplanet was also very beautiful.\n\nHe fumbled his way over the controls, trying to understand them.\nSomewhere stabilizing gyroscopes were running smoothly. He could hear\nthem. The controls were simple. He decided which way was up, and jammed\nhome the controls.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nIn the confined quarters his laughter had madness in it.\n\nNedra stared at him.\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Nothing happened. They're locked in place.\"\n\nHis eyes grew very wide.\n\n\"These controls are only for establishing the flight course. Once that\nis established and the rocket launched, they automatically lock in\nplace.\"\n\n\"Then we can't change the course?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nHer face puckered and she looked like a small girl about to cry.\n\nAnother panel to the left caught his attention. It had a red button on\nit. He studied the wiring on it.\n\n\"By thunder!\" the words burst involuntarily from his lips.\n\n\"What is it, Kurt?\"\n\n\"They put a manual control on the warhead. It's got to be that. It\ncan't be anything else.\" He pointed to the red button. \"Why do you\nsuppose they did that?\"\n\n\"Test purposes, probably, to check the firing mechanism before the\nwarhead was installed. What difference does it make?\" Nedra's voice was\nlistless.\n\n\"Maybe we can go to heaven.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nHe explained very carefully what he meant.\n\n\"Explode the rocket here in space?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" he said. His tone of voice said this was nothing, that anybody\ncould do it. West's voice clamored in his mind again. He ignored it.\nHis hand moved toward the red button.\n\n\"There's one thing I want you to know,\" he said, pausing.\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"I love you,\" he said.\n\nShe came into his arms like a tired, frightened child. \"I knew that\nthe minute I saw you,\" she said. He held her close to him and she lay\nthere, seemingly very content. \"All right,\" she said. \"I'm ready.\" Her\nlips sought his.\n\nKissing her, he reached behind her back and punched the red button.\n\nA relay thudded.\n\nDarkness closed in.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKurt Zen came out of that darkness to find himself staring upward into\nthe face of Sam West. There was something about that face that was\nfamiliar, something that he should have guessed long before. He tried\nto think what it was.\n\n\"How'd you get to heaven?\" he said.\n\n\"The warhead had a delay relay on it,\" West explained. \"It was about\nthirty seconds, as near as I can figure it. Anyhow it gave us just\nenough time to snatch both of you out of that rocket before she blew.\"\n\nWhat he said sounded very important. Under other circumstances, Zen\nknew he would have considered it important. But other things seemed\nmore significant now. \"Did she blow?\" he asked.\n\n\"All of ten minutes ago,\" West said exultantly. \"Do you know what this\nmeans, Kurt? Do you know what it means?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Zen answered. \"I won't have to be an eel.\" There was still this\nother thing that was important. \"Say--\"\n\n\"An eel?\" For an instant the craggy man was puzzled. Then he grasped\nthe meaning. \"You're right, Kurt. No eels--for any of us.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" Zen said. \"Nedra--\"\n\n\"She's right here beside you, still out from exhaustion. But she will\nbe all right.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Zen said again. This other fact was still in his mind. As he\ntried to think what it was, the answer came to him. He looked up at the\ncraggy man. \"You're not Sam West,\" he said.\n\n\"No?\" the craggy man said, the ghost of a smile on his lips. \"Then who\nam I?\"\n\n\"You're Jal Jonner. Nobody but Jal Jonner could have done all the\nthings you have done.\"\n\n\"You're right, Kurt. I'm Jal Jonner. And you're Kurt Zen. And this is\nNedra--\" Zen saw the smile on the face of the craggy man. It was a very\ngood smile, the best he had ever seen. Then it faded away as he sank\ninto the deep slumber of exhaustion. He did not even feel Jonner place\nNedra's hand in his as he went to sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Doomsday Eve, by Robert Moore Williams\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DOOMSDAY EVE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 50138.txt or 50138.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/0/1/3/50138/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
