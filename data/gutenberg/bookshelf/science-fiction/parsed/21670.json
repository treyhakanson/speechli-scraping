After all, such an invention is today but a step or two ahead\nof cold fact. But you might be surprised to learn that if this story was\n_A Columbus of Space_, the one I happen to have in mind, your\ngrand-parents may well have read it before you were born--for _A\nColumbus of Space_ was published in _All-Story_ magazine in 1909, thirty\nyears before the potentialities of U235 were realized, and nearly forty\nbefore the atomic bomb became a problem for people to think about.\n\nDid the author of this story simply make a lucky shot in the dark?\nPerhaps; but let me tell those who are inclined to think so that he was\na Carnegie lecturer, a member of half-a-dozen learned societies, one of\nthe first to write a book on Einstein's theory of relativity, and an\ninternationally known figure in his specialty, astronomy. His name is\nGarrett Putman Serviss.\n\nHe was born on March 24, 1851, at Sharon Springs, New York, of native\nNew England stock. His interest in astronomy began as a boy, and was\ngreatly stimulated when he began to examine the beauties of the heavens\nthrough a small telescope, the gift of his older brother. This\nencouraged his enrolling in the course of science at Cornell University\nin 1868 (its opening year) from which he was graduated in 1872. There\nfollowed two years at the Columbia College Law School, which he left as\nan LL. B.; and in June, 1874 he was admitted to the bar. He did not\npractice law, however, but turned instead to newspaper reporting.\n\nWhence came this interest in law and journalism? We can only guess,\ntracing its onset to the man's college days. As a Cornell sophomore, he\nwas the class poet; as a senior, its historian; and on commencement day\ndelivered an oration on \"The Perpetuity of the Heroic Element.\" But\nwhatever the origin of the interest, unquestioned ability supported it.\nFrom the position of reporter and correspondent with the New York\n_Tribune_ he rose to the post of copy editor on the staff of the _Sun_.\nFinally he became night editor, a position which he held for a full\ndecade.\n\nDuring this period we can see the old interest in science gradually\nassert itself. At first it took the form of anonymous articles, mainly\non matters astronomical. These usually appeared on the editorial page\nand, partly because they were then a novelty, partly because of a quirk\nof fate--editor-in-chief Charles Dana frequently had them set up in bold\ntype, believing their logic was a fine counter-irritant for heated\npolitical campaigns of the day--the attention of subscribers was focused\non them more sharply than usual. In fact, readers over the entire\ncountry were soon conjecturing about the identity of \"the _Sun's_\nastronomer.\" Very few knew that it was Garrett Serviss, who successfully\ncloaked his identity for years.\n\nSuccess in written popularizing of science led him to attempt its\nduplication on the lecture platform. There his triumphs were such as to\nlead him to resign as night editor of the _Sun_ in 1892 and make\nastronomy his life work. Until 1894 he was occupied with \"The Urania\nLectures.\" These were sponsored by Andrew Carnegie, and dealt with\ngeology, astronomy, archeology and similar scientific topics. With them\nServiss successfully toured the country, and it was only because of the\ngreat difficulty in transporting the elaborate staging equipment they\nrequired that they were eventually discontinued. He continued to give\npopular lectures, however, and one of his few biographers has credited\nhis greatness on the rostrum to \"a pleasant voice, a charming\npersonality, and a genuine enthusiasm for his subject.\"\n\nOne cannot doubt this enthusiasm; it shines forth unmistakably from all\nhis writings. Probably, too, it played the major part in enabling him to\nreach a wider reading public than any other astronomer before or after\nhim. For he never abandoned the pen. Up until his death, which occurred\non May 25, 1929, he wrote continually, syndicated newspaper columns,\nmagazine articles, books on astronomy, fiction.\n\nHis first book, _Astronomy with an Opera Glass_, appeared in 1888. He\nwas responsible for several other scientific titles (the reader is\nreferred to the bibliography at the end of this volume for a detailed\nlisting); they include _Einstein's Theory of Relativity_, which is a\ncompanion work to the motion picture of the same name. He was also\neditor-in-chief of Collier's sixteen-volume _Popular Science Library_.\nIt might be added that much of the editing and captioning of the\nEinstein film was his work, and that he collaborated with Leon Barritt\nin the invention of the Barritt-Serviss Star and Planet Finder, a device\nstill in use.\n\nIn comparison with his other writings his output of fiction is small:\nfive novels and a single short story. It is, however, characterized by\nthe same logic and interest, this time tossed aloft to soar on the wings\nof romantic imagination. Two of these works deal in some detail with the\nworld of the future as he thought it might be--prophetic fiction, if you\nwill; another two give us a picture of life on neighboring planets; and\nthe final couple, although they maintain a terrestrial locale, show as\nwide a scope of creative invention.\n\nIn only one of these does astronomy fail to play at least a supporting\nrole. That is _The Sky Pirate_ (1909), which is an adventure story laid\nin the year 1936. Its plot revolves around an abduction for ransom in a\nperiod which is visualized as rampant with piracy because of the general\nadoption of air transportation. As usual, fact has outmoded prophecy,\nfor long before 1936 airplane speeds exceeded the 140 miles per hour\nServiss predicted. We still need, though, his invention which enables\nbadly damaged aircraft to drift slowly down to a safe landing.\n\n_The Moon Metal_ (1900) deals with the problem of a strange, lunar metal\nused as a monetary standard to replace gold when, in 1949, huge new\ndeposits of that metal rendered it common as iron. This is of short\nstory length, and amply demonstrates the author's mastery of that\nmedium.\n\nFrom the prophetic as well as the entertainment standpoint, one of\nGarrett Serviss' most interesting novels is _A Columbus of Space_. Here\nhe visualizes atomic energy liberated and harnessed to drive a rocket to\nthe planet Venus. His conception is uncannily close to truth; he names\nuranium as the raw material from which is extracted the vital substance,\na \"crystallized powder\" which releases its energy on proper treatment.\nNo less intriguing is the description of the intelligent civilizations\non Venus which explorers from this world find.\n\nTwo later novels came from his pen: _The Moon Maiden_ (1915) and _The\nSecond Deluge_ (1911). The former is a scientific mystery, and probably\nthe least distinguished of his works. The latter, conversely, is\nprobably his best. It tells of a watery nebula which collides with the\nearth, flooding it with a second deluge; and of how the human race is\nsaved through the wisdom of one man who foresaw the coming disaster in\ntime to build a second ark. A new civilization which has mastered the\nsecret of atomic energy springs up on the planet as the waters recede.\nThe canvas is a broad one, and the author does it full justice.\n\nServiss' outstanding stories have been published abroad and re-printed\nin this country several times, a deserved tribute to their quality and\npopularity. His very first work of fiction, however, has been shrouded\nin obscurity for nearly half a century. Indeed, among collectors and\naficionados of the fantastic there was for a time debate as to its\nactual existence. This is hardly surprising, for until its reprinting in\nthis book _Edison's Conquest of Mars_ lay buried in the Congressional\nLibrary's file of the ephemeral New York _Evening Journal_, where it ran\nserially in early 1898.\n\nThis is a remarkable work. First of all, as many readers will quickly\ndiscern, it is in a sense a sequel to H. G. Wells' well known _War of\nthe Worlds_. The latter novel was serialized by _Cosmopolitan_ magazine\nin 1897; it caught the public's fickle fancy, and was widely commented\nupon. All evidence indicates that Serviss also read it: he was a regular\ncontributor to _Cosmopolitan_. Yet I am inclined to doubt that mere\nreading of _The War of the Worlds_ in itself prompted him to produce a\nwork in the same vein. Wells' effort was not concluded until the\nDecember, 1897 number of the magazine, and _Edison's Conquest of Mars_\nbegan on the following January 12th--a scant six weeks later. For\nServiss it was the initial excursion into the realm of fiction, and it\nis hard to conceive his so hastily adopting a new metier on personal\nimpulse alone. These circumstances, in conjunction with the context of\nthe novel itself, clearly stamp the entire business as clever\ncapitalization on already existent publicity. Again, I doubt if he\nthought of it at first in that light; his name was well enough known so\nthat he could live by his knowledge, not his wits. But to a newspaper\neditor the prospect of combining the authority of a nationally known and\nreputable astronomer with a work designed to satisfy a reading public's\nwaiting appetite for the unusual--in short, presenting legitimatized\nsensationalism at the psychological moment--this must have had\nirresistible appeal. That _Edison's Conquest of Mars_ was written on\neditorial commission, perhaps as fast as it appeared, seems, then, the\nmost probable interpretation.\n\nHistorically, the work is one of the earliest to employ the\ninterplanetary theme. It is the first to portray a battle fought by\nspace craft in the airless void; and possibly the first also to propose\nthe use of sealed suits that enable men to traverse a vacuum. Of the\nmore minor twists of plot initially found here that have since become\nparts of the \"pulp\" science-fiction writers' standard stock-in-trade,\nthere are literally too many to mention.\n\nThe novel opens with a description of the ruins of eastern America.\nAlthough the Martians who survived terrestrial bacteria have left the\nplanet, astronomical observations show a recurrence on the red planet of\nthe same lights that were a prelude to the first onslaught. The\nconclusion is inevitable: a second invasion is on the way. Serviss\npictures the gathering together of the most famous scientists of the\nday--Edison, Roentgen, Lord Kelvin and others. The Martian machines and\nweapons left behind are dismantled; their principles of operation are\ndiscovered and duplicated; and a defense against their forces is\nperfected. Armed with this knowledge and with the \"disintegrator,\" a\ndevice invented by Edison which is capable of reducing to atoms any\nsubstance at which it is aimed, the nations of the world pool their\nresources and launch an invasion of Mars across interplanetary space.\n\nMore by way of explanation than justification, it should be stated that\nscience today is diminishing the number of critics who are wont to label\nplots of this nature \"too fantastic.\" For them to say that the colossal\nhas become more important than the rational is, I feel, misleading. For\nthis is a branch of literature that is in many respects the most\nrational of all: it is a symptom of progress. These same critics also\ncomplain that a fantastic plot is frequently developed at the expense of\ncharacterization. To this, one may answer that at times what happens can\nbe more important than the people to whom it happens. In essence, both\ncharges derive from laying undue stress upon psychology as the only\nlegitimate fibre from which a fictional cloth may be woven. Undoubtedly\npsychology is necessary--but it can be a warp alone if a strong woof is\nsupplied. Let me cite two imaginary examples. If a single scientist had\nreleased atomic energy and was in doubt as to whether he should destroy\nhis secret or reveal it, the psychological processes that determine his\ndecision become more relevant to consideration than the decision itself.\nBut if that same scientist managed by the aid of atomic energy to\ntransport himself to Mars, I would unquestionably be more interested in\nwhat he found on that planet than in why an Oedipus complex drove him\nthere in the first place.\n\nIn the fiction of Garrett Serviss the sweeping magnitude of events\ndescribed gives them the leading role. Yet within the limits he has set\nfor himself he has used human psychology to good advantage. His stories\ndo not lack empathy, and they are rich in pictorial detail. Inevitably\nthey reflect the mores of the time, but do not emphasize them unduly. As\na consequence they remain readable and entertaining even to this day.\n\nThey show, too, that he was familiar with the works of the few authors\nin the genre who preceeded him. _A Columbus of Space_ was dedicated \"to\nthe readers of Jules Verne's romances,\"\n\n     Not because the author flatters himself that he can walk in the\n     Footsteps of that Immortal Dreamer, but because, like Jules Verne,\n     he believes that the World of Imagination is as legitimate a Domain\n     of the Human Mind as the World of Fact.\n\nGarrett Serviss modestly underestimated his abilities. With the\nperspective we possess today it can be seen that he is easily the equal\nof Verne, standing with him and H. G. Wells as one of the foremost\nscience-fiction writers of his day.\n\n\nA.

Y._\n_May 1947_\n\n\n\n\nEDISON'S CONQUEST OF MARS\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n_\"LET US GO TO MARS\"_\n\n\nIt is impossible that the stupendous events which followed the\ndisastrous invasion of the earth by the Martians should go without\nrecord, and circumstances having placed the facts at my disposal, I deem\nit a duty, both to posterity and to those who were witnesses of and\nparticipants in the avenging counterstroke that the earth dealt back at\nits ruthless enemy in the heavens, to write down the story in a\nconnected form.\n\nThe Martians had nearly all perished, not through our puny efforts, but\nin consequence of disease, and the few survivors fled in one of their\nprojectile cars, inflicting their crudest blow in the act of departure.\n\nThey possessed a mysterious explosive, of unimaginable puissance, with\nwhose aid they set their car in motion for Mars from a point in Bergen\nCounty, N. J., just back of the Palisades.\n\nThe force of the explosion may be imagined when it is recollected that\nthey had to give the car a velocity of more than seven miles per second\nin order to overcome the attraction of the earth and the resistance of\nthe atmosphere.\n\nThe shock destroyed all of New York that had not already fallen a prey,\nand all the buildings yet standing in the surrounding towns and cities\nfell in one far-circling ruin.\n\nThe Palisades tumbled in vast sheets, starting a tidal wave in the\nHudson that drowned the opposite shore.\n\nThe victims of this ferocious explosion were numbered by tens of\nthousands, and the shock, transmitted through the rocky frame of the\nglobe, was recorded by seismographic pendulums in England and on the\nContinent of Europe.\n\nThe terrible results achieved by the invaders had produced everywhere a\nmingled feeling of consternation and hopelessness. The devastation was\nwidespread. The death-dealing engines which the Martians had brought\nwith them had proved irresistible and the inhabitants of the earth\npossessed nothing capable of contending against them. There had been no\nprotection for the great cities; no protection even for the open\ncountry. Everything had gone down before the savage onslaught of those\nmerciless invaders from space. Savage ruins covered the sites of many\nformerly flourishing towns and villages, and the broken walls of great\ncities stared at the heavens like the exhumed skeletons of Pompeii. The\nawful agencies had extirpated pastures and meadows and dried up the very\nsprings of fertility in the earth where they had touched it. In some\nparts of the devastated lands pestilence broke out; elsewhere there was\nfamine. Despondency black as night brooded over some of the fairest\nportions of the globe.\n\nYet all had not been destroyed, because all had not been reached by the\nwithering hand of the destroyer. The Martians had not had time to\ncomplete their work before they themselves fell a prey to the diseases\nthat carried them off at the very culmination of their triumph.\n\nFrom those lands which had, fortunately, escaped invasion, relief was\nsent to the sufferers. The outburst of pity and of charity exceeded\nanything that the world had known. Differences of race and religion were\nswallowed up in the universal sympathy which was felt for those who had\nsuffered so terribly from an evil that was as unexpected as it was\nunimaginable in its enormity.\n\nBut the worst was not yet. More dreadful than the actual suffering and\nthe scenes of death and devastation which overspread the afflicted lands\nwas the profound mental and moral depression that followed. This was\nshared even by those who had not seen the Martians and had not witnessed\nthe destructive effects of the frightful engines of war that they had\nimported for the conquest of the earth. All mankind was sunk deep in\nthis universal despair, and it became tenfold blacker when the\nastronomers announced from their observatories that strange lights were\nvisible, moving and flashing upon the red surface of the Planet of War.\nThese mysterious appearances could only be interpreted in the light of\npast experience to mean that the Martians were preparing for another\ninvasion of the earth, and who could doubt that with the invincible\npowers of destruction at their command they would this time make their\nwork complete and final?\n\nThis startling announcement was the more pitiable in its effects because\nit served to unnerve and discourage those few of stouter hearts and more\nhopeful temperaments who had already begun the labor of restoration and\nreconstruction amid the embers of their desolated homes. In New York\nthis feeling of hope and confidence, this determination to rise against\ndisaster and to wipe out the evidences of its dreadful presence as\nquickly as possible, had especially manifested itself. Already a company\nhad been formed and a large amount of capital subscribed for the\nreconstruction of the destroyed bridges over the East River. Already\narchitects were busily at work planning new twenty-story hotels and\napartment houses; new churches and new cathedrals on a grander scale\nthan before.\n\nAmid this stir of renewed life came the fatal news that Mars was\nundoubtedly preparing to deal us a death blow. The sudden revulsion of\nfeeling flitted like the shadow of an eclipse over the earth. The scenes\nthat followed were indescribable. Men lost their reason. The\nfaint-hearted ended the suspense with self-destruction, the\nstout-hearted remained steadfast, but without hope and knowing not what\nto do.\n\nBut there was a gleam of hope of which the general public as yet knew\nnothing. It was due to a few dauntless men of science, conspicuous among\nwhom were Lord Kelvin, the great English savant; Herr Roentgen, the\ndiscover of the famous X-ray, and especially Thomas A. Edison, the\nAmerican genius of science. These men and a few others had examined with\nthe utmost care the engines of war, the flying machines, the generators\nof mysterious destructive forces that the Martians had produced, with\nthe object of discovering, if possible, the sources of their power.\n\nSuddenly from Mr. Edison's laboratory at Orange flashed the startling\nintelligence that he had not only discovered the manner in which the\ninvaders had been able to produce the mighty energies which they\nemployed with such terrible effect, but that, going further, he had\nfound a way to overcome them.\n\nThe glad news was quickly circulated throughout the civilized world.\nLuckily the Atlantic cables had not been destroyed by the Martians, so\nthat communication between the Eastern and Western continents was\nuninterrupted. It was a proud day for America. Even while the Martians\nhad been upon the earth, carrying everything before them, demonstrating\nto the confusion of the most optimistic that there was no possibility of\nstanding against them, a feeling--a confidence had manifested itself in\nFrance, to a minor extent in England, and particularly in Russia, that\nthe Americans might discover means to meet and master the invaders.\n\nNow, it seemed, this hope and expectation was to be realized. Too late,\nit is true, in a certain sense, but not too late to meet the new\ninvasion which the astronomers had announced was impending. The effect\nwas as wonderful and indescribable as that of the despondency which but\na little while before had overspread the world. One could almost hear\nthe universal sigh of relief which went up from humanity. To relief\nsucceeded confidence--so quickly does the human spirit recover like an\nelastic spring, when pressure is released.\n\n\"Let them come,\" was the almost joyous cry. \"We shall be ready for them\nnow. The Americans have solved the problem. Edison has placed the means\nof victory within our power.\"\n\nLooking back upon that time now, I recall, with a thrill, the pride that\nstirred me at the thought that, after all, the inhabitants of the earth\nwere a match for those terrible men from Mars, despite all the advantage\nwhich they had gained from their millions of years of prior civilization\nand science.\n\nAs good fortunes, like bad, never come singly, the news of Mr. Edison's\ndiscovery was quickly followed by additional glad tidings from that\nlaboratory of marvels in the lap of the Orange mountains. During their\ncareer of conquest the Martians had astonished the inhabitants of the\nearth no less with their flying machines--which navigated our atmosphere\nas easily as they had that of their native planet--than with their more\ndestructive inventions. These flying machines in themselves had given\nthem an enormous advantage in the contest. High above the desolation\nthat they had caused to reign on the surface of the earth, and, out of\nthe range of our guns, they had hung safe in the upper air. From the\nclouds they had dropped death upon the earth.\n\nNow, rumor declared that Mr. Edison had invented and perfected a flying\nmachine much more complete and manageable than those of the Martians had\nbeen. Wonderful stories quickly found their way into the newspapers\nconcerning what Mr. Edison had already accomplished with the aid of his\nmodel electrical balloon. His laboratory was carefully guarded against\nthe invasion of the curious, because he rightly felt that a premature\nannouncement, which should promise more than could actually be\nfulfilled, would, at this critical juncture, plunge mankind back again\ninto the gulf of despair, out of which it had just begun to emerge.\n\nNevertheless, inklings of the truth leaked out. The flying machine had\nbeen seen by many persons hovering by night high above the Orange hills\nand disappearing in the faint starlight as if it had gone away into the\ndepths of space, out of which it would re-emerge before the morning\nlight had streaked the east, and be seen settling down again within the\nwalls that surrounded the laboratory of the great inventor. At length\nthe rumor, gradually deepening into a conviction, spread that Edison\nhimself, accompanied by a few scientific friends, had made an\nexperimental trip to the moon. At a time when the spirit of mankind was\nless profoundly stirred, such a story would have been received with\ncomplete incredulity, but now, rising on the wings of the new hope that\nwas buoying up the earth, this extraordinary rumor became a day star of\ntruth to the nations.\n\nAnd it was true. I had myself been one of the occupants of the car of\nthe flying Ship of Space on that night when it silently left the earth,\nand rising out of the great shadow of the globe, sped on to the moon. We\nhad landed upon the scarred and desolate face of the earth's satellite,\nand but that there are greater and more interesting events, the telling\nof which must not be delayed, I should undertake to describe the\nparticulars of this first visit of men to another world.\n\n[Illustration: _I had myself been one of the occupants of the car\nof the flying Ship of Space on that night, when it silently left the\nearth, and, rising out of the great shadow of the globe, sped on to the\nmoon._]\n\nBut, as I have already intimated, this was only an experimental trip. By\nvisiting this little nearby island in the ocean of space, Mr. Edison\nsimply wished to demonstrate the practicability of his invention, and to\nconvince, first of all, himself and his scientific friends that it was\npossible for men--mortal men--to quit and to revisit the earth at their\nwill. That aim this experimental trip triumphantly attained.\n\nIt would carry me into technical details that would hardly interest the\nreader to describe the mechanism of Mr. Edison's flying machine. Let it\nsuffice to say that it depended upon the principal of electrical\nattraction and repulsion. By means of a most ingenious and complicated\nconstruction he had mastered the problem of how to produce, in a limited\nspace, electricity of any desired potential and of any polarity, and\nthat without danger to the experimenter or to the material experimented\nupon. It is gravitation, as everybody knows, that makes man a prisoner\non the earth. If he could overcome, or neutralize, gravitation he could\nfloat away, a free creature of interstellar space. Mr. Edison in his\ninvention had pitted electricity against gravitation. Nature, in fact,\nhad done the same thing long before. Every astronomer knew it, but none\nhad been able to imitate or to reproduce this miracle of nature. When a\ncomet approaches the sun, the orbit in which it travels indicates that\nit is moving under the impulse of the sun's gravitation. It is in\nreality falling in a great parabolic or elliptical curve through space.\nBut, while a comet approaches the sun it begins to display--stretching\nout for millions, and sometimes hundreds of millions of miles on the\nside away from the sun--an immense luminous train called its tail. This\ntrain extends back into that part of space from which the comet is\nmoving. Thus the sun at one and the same time is drawing the comet\ntoward itself and driving off from the comet in an opposite direction\nminute particles or atoms which, instead of obeying the gravitational\nforce, are plainly compelled to disobey it. That this energy, which the\nsun exercises against its own gravitation, is electrical in its nature,\nhardly anybody will doubt. The head of the comet being comparatively\nheavy and massive, falls on toward the sun, despite the electrical\nrepulsion. But the atoms which form the tail, being almost without\nweight, yield to the electrical rather than to the gravitational\ninfluence, and so fly away from the sun.\n\nNow, what Mr. Edison had done was, in effect, to create an electrified\nparticle which might be compared to one of the atoms composing the tail\nof a comet, although in reality it was a kind of car, of metal, weighing\nsome hundreds of pounds and capable of bearing some thousands of pounds\nwith it in its flight. By producing, with the aid of the electrical\ngenerator contained in this car, an enormous charge of electricity, Mr.\nEdison was able to counterbalance, and a trifle more than\ncounterbalance, the attraction of the earth, and thus cause the car to\nfly off from the earth as an electrified pithball flies from the prime\nconductor.\n\nAs we sat in the brilliantly lighted chamber that formed the interior of\nthe car, and where stores of compressed air had been provided together\nwith chemical apparatus, by means of which fresh supplies of oxygen and\nnitrogen might be obtained for our consumption during the flight through\nspace, Mr. Edison touched a polished button, thus causing the generation\nof the required electrical charge on the exterior of the car, and\nimmediately we began to rise.\n\nThe moment and direction of our flight had been so timed and\nprearranged, that the original impulse would carry us straight toward\nthe moon.\n\nWhen we fell within the sphere of attraction of that orb it only became\nnecessary to so manipulate the electrical charge upon our car as nearly,\nbut not quite, to counterbalance the effect of the moon's attraction in\norder that we might gradually approach it and with an easy motion,\nsettle, without shock, upon its surface.\n\nWe did not remain to examine the wonders of the moon, although we could\nnot fail to observe many curious things therein. Having demonstrated the\nfact that we could not only leave the earth, but could journey through\nspace and safely land upon the surface of another planet, Mr. Edison's\nimmediate purpose was fulfilled, and we hastened back to the earth,\nemploying in leaving the moon and landing again upon our own planet the\nsame means of control over the electrical attraction and repulsion\nbetween the respective planets and our car which I have already\ndescribed.\n\nWhen actual experiment had thus demonstrated the practicability of the\ninvention, Mr. Edison no longer withheld the news of what he had been\ndoing from the world. The telegraph lines and the ocean cables labored\nwith the messages that in endless succession, and burdened with an\ninfinity of detail, were sent all over the earth. Everywhere the utmost\nenthusiasm was aroused.\n\n\"Let the Martians come,\" was the cry. \"If necessary, we can quit the\nearth as the Athenians fled from Athens before the advancing host of\nXerxes, and like them, take refuge upon our ships--these new ships of\nspace, with which American inventiveness has furnished us.\"\n\nAnd then, like a flash, some genius struck out an idea that fired the\nworld.\n\n\"Why should we wait? Why should we run the risk of having our cities\ndestroyed and our lands desolated a second time? Let us go to Mars. We\nhave the means. Let us beard the lion in his den. Let us ourselves turn\nconquerors and take possession of that detestable planet, and if\nnecessary, destroy it in order to relieve the earth of this perpetual\nthreat which now hangs over us like the sword of Damocles.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\n_THE DISINTEGRATOR_\n\n\nThis enthusiasm would have had but little justification had Mr. Edison\ndone nothing more than invent a machine which could navigate the\natmosphere and the regions of interplanetary space.\n\nHe had, however, and this fact was generally known, although the details\nhad not yet leaked out--invented also machines of war intended to meet\nthe utmost that the Martians could do for either offence or defence in\nthe struggle which was now about to ensue.\n\nActing upon the hint which had been conveyed from various investigations\nin the domain of physics, and concentrating upon the problem all those\nunmatched powers of intellect which distinguished him, the great\ninventor had succeeded in producing a little implement which one could\ncarry in his hand, but which was more powerful than any battleship that\never floated. The details of its mechanism could not be easily\nexplained, without the use of tedious technicalities and the employment\nof terms, diagrams and mathematical statements, all of which would lie\noutside the scope of this narrative. But the principle of the thing was\nsimple enough. It was upon the great scientific doctrine, which we have\nsince seen so completely and brilliantly developed, of the law of\nharmonic vibrations, extending from atoms and molecules at one end of\nthe series up to the worlds and suns at the other end, that Mr. Edison\nbased his invention.\n\nEvery kind of substance has its own vibratory rhythm. That of iron\ndiffers from that of pine wood. The atoms of gold do not vibrate in the\nsame time or through the same range as those of lead, and so on for all\nknown substances, and all the chemical elements. So, on a larger scale,\nevery massive body has its period of vibration. A great suspension\nbridge vibrates, under the impulse of forces that are applied to it, in\nlong periods. No company of soldiers ever crosses such a bridge without\nbreaking step. If they tramped together, and were followed by other\ncompanies keeping the same time with their feet, after a while the\nvibrations of the bridge would become so great and destructive that it\nwould fall in pieces. So any structure, if its vibration rate is known,\ncould easily be destroyed by a force applied to it in such a way that it\nshould simply increase the swing of those vibrations up to the point of\ndestruction.\n\nNow Mr. Edison had been able to ascertain the vibratory swing of many\nwell known substances, and to produce, by means of the instrument which\nhe had contrived, pulsations in the ether which were completely under\nhis control, and which could be made long or short, quick or slow, at\nhis will. He could run through the whole gamut from the slow vibrations\nof sound in air up to the four hundred and twenty-five millions of\nmillions of vibrations per second of the ultra red rays.\n\nHaving obtained an instrument of such power, it only remained to\nconcentrate its energy upon a given object in order that the atoms\ncomposing that object should be set into violent undulation, sufficient\nto burst it asunder and to scatter its molecules broadcast. This the\ninventor effected by the simplest means in the world--simply a parabolic\nreflector by which the destructive waves could be sent like a beam of\nlight, but invisible, in any direction and focused upon any desired\npoint.\n\nI had the good fortune to be present when this powerful engine of\ndestruction was submitted to its first test. We had gone upon the roof\nof Mr. Edison's laboratory and the inventor held the little instrument,\nwith its attached mirror, in his hand. We looked about for some object\non which to try its powers. On a bare limb of a tree not far away, for\nit was late in fall, sat a disconsolate crow.\n\n\"Good,\" said Mr. Edison, \"that will do.\" He touched a button at the side\nof the instrument and a soft, whirring noise was heard.\n\n\"Feathers,\" said Mr. Edison, \"have a vibration period of three hundred\nand eighty-six million per second.\"\n\nHe adjusted the index as he spoke. Then, through a sighting tube, he\naimed at the bird.\n\n\"Now watch,\" he said.\n\nAnother soft whirr in the instrument, a momentary flash of light close\naround it, and, behold, the crow had turned from black to white!\n\n\"Its feathers are gone,\" said the inventor; \"they have been dissipated\ninto their constituent atoms. Now, we will finish the crow.\"\n\nInstantly there was another adjustment of the index, another outshooting\nof vibratory force, a rapid up and down motion of the index to include a\ncertain range of vibrations, and the crow itself was gone--vanished in\nempty space! There was the bare twig on which a moment before it had\nstood. Behind, in the sky, was the white cloud against which its black\nform had been sharply outlined, but there was no more crow.\n\n\"That looks bad for the Martians, doesn't it?\" said the Wizard. \"I have\nascertained the vibration rate of all the materials of which their war\nengines, whose remains we have collected together, are composed. They\ncan be shattered into nothingness in the fraction of a second. Even if\nthe vibration period were not known, it could quickly be hit upon by\nsimply running through the gamut.\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried one of the onlookers. \"We have met the Martians and they\nare ours.\"\n\nSuch in brief was the first of the contrivances which Mr. Edison\ninvented for the approaching war with Mars.\n\nAnd these facts had become widely known. Additional experiments had\ncompleted the demonstration of the inventor's ability, with the aid of\nhis wonderful instrument, to destroy any given object, or any part of an\nobject, provided that that part differed in its atomic constitution, and\nconsequently in its vibratory period, from the other parts.\n\nA most impressive public exhibit of the powers of the little\ndisintegrator was given amid the ruins of New York. On lower Broadway a\npart of the walls of one of the gigantic buildings, which had been\ndestroyed by the Martians, impended in such a manner that it threatened\nat any moment to fall upon the heads of the passersby. The Fire\nDepartment did not dare touch it. To blow it up seemed a dangerous\nexpedient, because already new buildings had been erected in its\nneighborhood, and their safety would be imperilled by the flying\nfragments. The fact happened to come to my knowledge.\n\n\"Here is an opportunity,\" I said to Mr. Edison, \"to try the powers of\nyour machine on a large scale.\"\n\n\"Capital,\" he instantly replied. \"I shall go at once.\"\n\nFor the work now in hand it was necessary to employ a battery of\ndisintegrators, since the field of destruction covered by each was\ncomparatively limited. All of the impending portions of the wall must be\ndestroyed at once and together, for otherwise the danger would rather be\naccentuated rather than annihilated. The disintegrators were placed upon\nthe roof of a neighboring building, so adjusted that their fields of\ndestruction overlapped one another upon the wall. Their indexes were all\nset to correspond with the vibration period of the peculiar kind of\nbrick of which the wall consisted. Then the energy was turned on, and a\nshout of wonder arose from the multitudes which had assembled at a safe\ndistance to witness the experiment.\n\nThe wall did not fall; it did not break asunder; no fragments shot this\nway and that and high in the air; there was no explosion; no shock or\nnoise disturbed the still atmosphere--only a soft whirr, that seemed to\npervade everything and to tingle in the nerves of the spectators;\nand--what had been was not! The wall was gone! But high above and all\naround the place where it had hung over the street with its threat of\ndeath there appeared, swiftly billowing outward in every direction, a\nfaint bluish cloud. It was the scattered atoms of the destroyed wall.\n\nAnd now the cry \"On to Mars!\" was heard on all sides. But for such an\nenterprise funds were needed--millions upon millions. Yet some of the\nfairest and richest portions of the earth had been impoverished by the\nfrightful ravages of those enemies who had dropped down upon them from\nthe skies. Still, the money must be had. The salvation of the planet, as\neveryone was now convinced, depended upon the successful negotiation of\na gigantic war fund, in comparison with which all the expenditures in\nall of the wars that had been waged by the nations for 2,000 years would\nbe insignificant. The electrical ships and the vibration engines must be\nconstructed by scores and thousands. Only Mr. Edison's immense resources\nand unrivaled equipment had enabled him to make the models whose powers\nhad been so satisfactorily shown. But to multiply these upon a war scale\nwas not only beyond the resources of any individual--hardly a nation on\nthe globe in the period of its greatest prosperity could have undertaken\nsuch a work. All the nations, then, must now conjoin. They must unite\ntheir resources, and if necessary, exhaust all their hoards, in order to\nraise the needed sum.\n\nNegotiations were at once begun. The United States naturally took the\nlead, and their leadership was never for a moment questioned abroad.\n\nWashington was selected as the place of meeting for a great congress of\nnations. Washington, luckily, had been one of the places which had not\nbeen touched by the Martians. But if Washington had been a city composed\nof hotels alone, and every hotel so great as to be a little city in\nitself, it would have been utterly insufficient for the accommodation of\nthe innumerable throngs which now flocked to the banks of the Potomac.\nBut when was American enterprise unequal to a crisis? The necessary\nhotels, lodging-houses and restaurants were constructed with astounding\nrapidity. One could see the city growing and expanding day by day and\nweek after week. It flowed over Georgetown Heights; it leaped the\nPotomac; it spread east and west, south and north; square mile after\nsquare mile of territory was buried under the advancing buildings, until\nthe gigantic city, which had thus grown up like a mushroom in a night,\nwas fully capable of accommodating all its expected guests.\n\nAt first it had been intended that the heads of the various governments\nshould in person attend this universal congress, but as the enterprise\nwent on, as the enthusiasm spread, as the necessity for haste became\nmore apparent through the warning notes which were constantly sounded\nfrom the observatories where the astronomers were nightly beholding new\nevidences of threatening preparations in Mars, the kings and queens of\nthe old world felt that they could not remain at home; that their proper\nplace was at the new focus and center of the whole world--the city of\nWashington. Without concerted action, without interchange of suggestion,\nthis impulse seemed to seize all the old world monarchs at once.\nSuddenly cablegrams flashed to the government at Washington, announcing\nthat Queen Victoria, the Emperor William, the Czar Nicholas, Alphonso of\nSpain, with his mother, Maria Christina; the old emperor Francis Joseph\nand the empress Elizabeth, of Austria; King Oscar and Queen Sophia, of\nSweden and Norway; King Humbert and Queen Margherita, of Italy; King\nGeorge and Queen Olga, of Greece; Abdul Hamid, of Turkey; Tsait'ien,\nEmperor of China; Mutsuhito, the Japanese Mikado, with his beautiful\nPrincess Haruko; the President of France, the President of Switzerland,\nthe First Syndic of the little republic of Andorra, perched on the crest\nof the Pyrenees, and the heads of all the Central and South American\nrepublics, were coming to Washington to take part in the deliberations,\nwhich, it was felt, were to settle the fate of earth and Mars.\n\nOne day, after this announcement had been received, and the additional\nnews had come that nearly all the visiting monarchs had set out,\nattended by brilliant suites and convoyed by fleets of warships, for\ntheir destination, some coming across the Atlantic to the port of New\nYork, others across the Pacific to San Francisco, Mr. Edison said to me:\n\n\"This will be a fine spectacle. Would you like to watch it?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I replied.\n\nThe Ship of Space was immediately at our disposal. I think I have not\nyet mentioned the fact that the inventor's control over the electrical\ngenerator carried in the car was so perfect that by varying the\npotential or changing the polarity he could cause it slowly or swiftly,\nas might be desired, to approach or recede from any object. The only\npractical difficulty was presented when the polarity of the electrical\ncharge upon an object in the neighborhood of the car was unknown to\nthose in the car, and happened to be opposite to that of the charge to\nwhich the car, at that particular moment was bearing. In such a case, of\ncourse, the car would fly toward the object, whatever it might be, like\na pithball or a feather, attracted to the knob of an electrical machine.\nIn this way, considerable danger was occasionally encountered, and a few\naccidents could not be avoided. Fortunately, however, such cases were\nrare. It was only now and then that, owing to some local cause,\nelectrical polarities unknown to or unexpected by the navigators,\nendangered the safety of the car. As I shall have occasion to relate\nhowever, in the course of the narrative, this danger became more acute\nand assumed at times a most formidable phase, when we had ventured\noutside the sphere of the earth and were moving through the unexplored\nregions beyond.\n\nOn this occasion, having embarked, we rose rapidly to a height of some\nthousands of feet and directed our course over the Atlantic. When\nhalf-way to Ireland, we beheld, in the distance, steaming westward, the\nsmoke of several fleets. As we drew nearer a marvelous spectacle\nunfolded itself to our eyes. From the northeast, their great guns\nflashing in the sunlight and their huge funnels belching black volumes\nthat rested like thunder clouds upon the sea, came the mighty warships\nof England, with her meteor flag streaming red in the breeze, while the\nroyal insignia, indicating the presence of the ruler of the British\nEmpire, was conspicuously displayed upon the flagship of the squadron.\n\nFollowing a course more directly westward there appeared, under another\nblack cloud of smoke, the hulls and guns and burgeons of another great\nfleet, carrying the tri-color of France, and bearing in its midst the\nhead of the magnificent republic of western Europe.\n\nFurther south, beating up against the northerly winds came a third fleet\nwith the gold and red of Spain fluttering from its masthead. This, too,\nwas carrying its King westward, where now, indeed, the star of empire\nhad taken its way.\n\nRising a little higher, so as to extend our horizon, we saw coming down\nthe English channel, behind the British fleet, the black ships of\nRussia. Side by side, or following one another's lead, these war fleets\nwere on a peaceful voyage that belied their threatening appearance.\nThere had been no thought of danger to or from the forts and ports of\nrival nations which they had passed. There was no enmity, and no fear\nbetween them when the throats of their ponderous guns yawned at one\nanother across the waves. They were now, in spirit, all one fleet,\nhaving one object, bearing against one enemy, ready to defend but one\ncountry, and that country was the entire earth.\n\nIt was some time before we caught sight of the emperor William's fleet.\nIt seems that the Kaiser, although at first consenting to the\narrangement by which Washington had been selected as the assembling\nplace for the nations, afterwards objected to it.\n\n\"I ought to do this thing myself,\" he had said. \"My glorious ancestors\nwould never have consented to allow these upstart Republicans to lead in\na warlike enterprise of this kind. What would my grandfather have said\nto it? I suspect that it is some scheme aimed at the divine right of\nkings.\"\n\nBut the good sense of the German people would not suffer their ruler to\nplace them in a position so false and so untenable. And swept along by\ntheir enthusiasm the Kaiser had at last consented to embark upon his\nflagship at Kiel, and now he was following the other fleets on their\ngreat mission to the Western Continent.\n\nWhy did they bring their warships when their intentions were peaceable,\ndo you ask? Well, it was partly the effect of ancient habit, and partly\ndue to the fact that such multitudes of officials and members of ruling\nfamilies wished to embark for Washington that the ordinary means of\nocean communications would have been utterly inadequate to convey them.\n\nAfter we had feasted our eyes on this strange sight, Mr. Edison suddenly\nexclaimed: \"Now let us see the fellows from the rising sun.\"\n\nThe car was immediately directed toward the west. We rapidly approached\nthe American coast, and as we sailed over the Allegheny Mountains and\nthe broad plains of the Ohio and the Mississippi, we saw crawling\nbeneath us from west, south and north, an endless succession of railway\ntrains bearing their multitudes on toward Washington. With marvelous\nspeed we rushed westward, rising high to skim over the snow-topped peaks\nof the Rocky Mountains and then the glittering rim of the Pacific was\nbefore us. Half-way between the American Coast and Hawaii we met the\nfleets coming from China and Japan. Side by side they were plowing the\nmain, having forgotten, or laid aside, all the animosities of their\nformer wars.\n\nI well remember how my heart was stirred at this impressive exhibition\nof the boundless influence which my country had come to exercise over\nall the people of the world, and I turned to look at the man to whose\ngenius this uprising of the earth was due. But Mr. Edison, after his\nwont, appeared totally unconscious of the fact that he was personally\nresponsible for what was going on. His mind, seemingly, was entirely\nabsorbed in considering problems, the solution of which might be\nessential to our success in the terrific struggle which was soon to\nbegin.\n\n\"Well, have you seen enough?\" he asked. \"Then let us go back to\nWashington.\"\n\nAs we speeded back across the continent we beheld beneath us again the\nburdened express trains rushing toward the Atlantic, and hundreds of\nthousands of upturned eyes watched our swift progress, and volleys of\ncheers reached our ears, for everyone knew that this was Edison's\nelectrical warship, on which the hope of the nation, and the hopes of\nall the nations, depended. These scenes were repeated again and again\nuntil the car hovered over the still expanding capitol on the Potomac,\nwhere the unceasing ring of hammers rose to the clouds.\n\n[Illustration: _A consultation in Wizard Edison's laboratory\nbetween him and Professor Serviss on the best means of repaying the\ndamage wrought upon this planet by the Martians._]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\n_THE CONGRESS OF NATIONS_\n\n\nThe day appointed for the assembling of the nations in Washington opened\nbright and beautiful. Arrangements had been made for the reception of\nthe distinguished guests at the Capitol. No time was to be wasted, and\nhaving assembled in the Senate Chamber, the business that had called\nthem together was to be immediately begun. The scene in Pennsylvania\nAvenue, when the procession of dignitaries and royalties passed up\ntoward the Capitol was one never to be forgotten. Bands were playing,\nmagnificent equipages flashed in the morning sunlight, the flags of\nevery nation on the earth fluttered in the breeze. Queen Victoria, with\nthe Prince of Wales escorting her, and riding in an open carriage, was\ngreeted with roars of cheers; the emperor William, following in another\ncarriage with empress Victoria at his side, condescended to bow and\nsmile in response to the greetings of a free people. Each of the other\nmonarchs was received in a similar manner. The Czar of Russia proved to\nbe an especial favorite with the multitude on account of the ancient\nfriendship of his house for America. But the greatest applause of all\ncame when the President of France, followed by the President of\nSwitzerland and the First Syndic of the little republic of Andorra, made\ntheir appearance. Equally warm were the greetings extended to the\nrepresentatives of Mexico and the South American States.\n\nThe crowd apparently hardly knew at first how to receive the Sultan of\nTurkey, but the universal good feeling was in his favor, and finally\nrounds of hand clapping and cheers greeted his progress along the\nsplendid avenue.\n\nA happy idea had apparently occurred to the Emperor of China and the\nMikado of Japan, for, attended by their intermingled suites, they rode\ntogether in a single carriage. This object lesson in the unity of\ninternational feeling immensely pleased the spectators.\n\nThe scene in the Senate Chamber stirred everyone profoundly. That it was\nbrilliant and magnificent goes without saying, but there was a\nseriousness, an intense feeling of expectancy, pervading both those who\nlooked on and those who were to do the work for which these magnates of\nthe earth had assembled, which produced an ineradicable impression. The\nPresident of the United States, of course, presided. Representatives of\nthe greater powers occupied the front seats, and some of them were\nhonored with special chairs near the President.\n\nNo time was wasted in preliminaries. The President made a brief speech.\n\n\"We have come together,\" he said, \"to consider a question that equally\ninterests the whole earth. I need not remind you that unexpectedly and\nwithout provocation on our part the people--the monsters, I should\nrather say--of Mars, recently came down upon the earth, attacked us in\nour homes and spread desolation around them. Having the advantage of\nages of evolution, which for us are yet in the future, they brought with\nthem engines of death and destruction against which we found it\nimpossible to contend. It is within the memory of every one within reach\nof my voice that it was through the entirely unexpected succor which\nProvidence sent us that we were suddenly and effectually freed from the\ninvaders. By our own efforts we could have done nothing.\n\n\"But, as you all know, the first feeling of relief which followed the\ndeath of our foes was quickly succeeded by the fearful news which came\nto us from the observatories, that the Martians were undoubtedly\npreparing for a second invasion of our planet. Against this we should\nhave had no recourse and no hope but for the genius of one of my\ncountrymen, who, as you are all aware, has perfected means which may\nenable us not only to withstand the attack of those awful enemies, but\nto meet them, and, let us hope, to conquer them on their own ground.\n\n\"Mr. Edison is here to explain to you what those means are. But we have\nalso another object. Whether we send a fleet of interplanetary ships to\ninvade Mars or whether we simply confine our attention to works of\ndefense, in either case it will be necessary to raise a very large sum\nof money. None of us has yet recovered from the effects of the recent\ninvasion. The earth is poor today compared to its position a few years\nago; yet we can not allow our poverty to stand in the way. The money,\nthe means, must be had. It will be part of our business here to raise a\ngigantic war fund by the aid of which we can construct the equipment and\nmachinery that we shall require. This, I think, is all I need to say.\nLet us proceed to business.\"\n\n\"Where is Mr. Edison?\" cried a voice.\n\n\"Will Mr. Edison please step forward?\" said the President.\n\nThere was a stir in the assembly, and the iron-grey head of the great\ninventor was seen moving through the crowd. In his hand he carried one\nof his marvelous disintegrators. He was requested to explain and\nillustrate its operation. Mr. Edison smiled.\n\n\"I can explain its details,\" he said, \"to Lord Kelvin, for instance, but\nif Their Majesties will excuse me, I doubt whether I can make it plain\nto the Crown Heads.\"\n\nThe Emperor William smiled superciliously. Apparently he thought that\nanother assault had been committed upon the divine right of kings. But\nthe Czar Nicholas appeared to be amused, and the Emperor of China, who\nhad been studying English, laughed in his sleeve, as if he suspected\nthat a joke had been perpetrated.\n\n\"I think,\" said one of the deputies, \"that a simple exhibition of the\npowers of the instrument, without a technical explanation of its method\nof working, will suffice for our purpose.\"\n\nThis suggestion was immediately approved. In response to it, Mr. Edison,\nby a few simple experiments, showed how he could quickly and certainly\nshatter into its constituent atoms any object upon which the vibratory\nforce of the disintegrator should be directed. In this manner he caused\nan inkstand to disappear under the very nose of the Emperor William\nwithout a spot of ink being scattered upon his sacred person, but\nevidently the odor of the disunited atoms was not agreeable to the\nnostrils of the Kaiser.\n\nMr. Edison also explained in general terms the principle on which the\ninstrument worked. He was greeted with round after round of applause,\nand the spirit of the assembly rose high.\n\nNext the workings of the electrical ship were explained, and it was\nannounced that after the meeting had adjourned an exhibition of the\nflying powers of the ship would be given in the open air.\n\nThese experiments, together with the accompanying explanations, added to\nwhat had already been disseminated through the public press, were quite\nsufficient to convince all the representatives who had assembled in\nWashington that the problem of how to conquer the Martians had been\nsolved. The means were plainly at hand. It only remained to apply them.\nFor this purpose, as the President had pointed out, it would be\nnecessary to raise a very large sum of money.\n\n\"How much will be needed?\" asked one of the English representatives.\n\n\"At least ten thousand millions of dollars,\" replied the President.\n\n\"It would be safer,\" said a Senator from the Pacific Coast, \"to make it\ntwenty five thousand millions.\"\n\n\"I suggest,\" said the King of Italy, \"that the nations be called in\nalphabetical order, and that the representatives of each name a sum\nwhich he is ready and able to contribute.\"\n\n\"We want the cash or its equivalent,\" shouted the Pacific Coast Senator.\n\n\"I shall not follow the alphabet strictly,\" said the President, \"but\nshall begin with the larger nations first. Perhaps, under the\ncircumstances, it is proper that the United States should lead the way.\nMr. Secretary,\" he continued, turning to the Secretary of the Treasury,\n\"how much can we stand?\"\n\n\"At least a thousand millions,\" replied the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nA roar of applause that shook the room burst from the assembly. Even\nsome of the monarchs threw up their hats. The Emperor Tsait'ien smiled\nfrom ear to ear. One of the Roko Tuis, or native chiefs, from Fiji,\nsprang up and brandished a war club.\n\nThe President then proceeded to call the other nations, beginning with\nAustria-Hungary and ending with Zanzibar, whose Sultan, Hamoud bin\nMahomed, had come to the congress in the escort of Queen Victoria. Each\ncontributed liberally.\n\nGermany, coming in alphabetical order just before Great Britain, had\nnamed, through its chancellor, the sum of $500,000,000, but when the\nFirst Lord of the British Treasury, not wishing to be behind the United\nStates, named double that sum as the contribution of the British Empire,\nthe Emperor William looked displeased. He spoke a word in the ear of the\nChancellor who immediately raised his hand.\n\n\"We will give a thousand million dollars,\" said the Chancellor.\n\nQueen Victoria seemed surprised, though not displeased. The First Lord\nof the Treasury met her eye, and then, rising in his place, said:\n\n\"Make it fifteen hundred million for Great Britain.\"\n\nEmperor William consulted again with his Chancellor, but evidently\nconcluded not to increase his bid.\n\nBut, at any rate, the fund had benefited to the amount of a thousand\nmillions by this little outburst of imperial rivalry.\n\nThe greatest surprise of all, however, came when the King of Siam was\ncalled upon for his contribution. He had not been given a foremost place\nin the Congress, but when the name of his country was pronounced he rose\nby his chair, dressed in a gorgeous specimen of the peculiar attire of\nhis country, then slowly pushed his way to the front, stepped up to the\nPresident's desk and deposited upon it a small box.\n\n\"This is our contribution,\" he said in broken English.\n\nThe cover was lifted, and there darted, shimmering in the half-gloom of\nthe Chamber, a burst of iridescence from the box.\n\n\"My friends of the Western world,\" continued the King of Siam, \"will be\ninterested in seeing this gem. Only once before has the eye of a\nEuropean been blessed with the sight of it. Your books will tell you\nthat in the seventeenth century a traveller, Tavernier, saw in India an\nunmatched diamond which afterward disappeared like a meteor, and was\nthought to have been lost from the earth. You all know the name of that\ndiamond and its history. It is the Great Mogul, and it lies before you.\nHow it came into my possession I shall not explain. At any rate, it is\nhonestly mine, and I freely contribute it here to aid in protecting my\nnative planet against those enemies who appear determined to destroy\nit.\"\n\nWhen the excitement which the appearance of this long lost treasure,\nthat had been the subject of so many romances and of such long and\nfruitless search, had subsided, the President continued calling the\nlist, until he had completed it.\n\nUpon taking the sum of the contributions (the Great Mogul was reckoned\nat three millions) it was found to be still one thousand millions short\nof the required amount.\n\nThe secretary of the Treasury was instantly on his feet.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" he said, \"I think we can stand that addition. Let it be\nadded to the contribution of the United States of America.\"\n\nWhen the cheers that greeted the conclusion of the business were over,\nthe President announced that the next affair of the Congress was to\nselect a director who should have entire charge of the preparations for\nthe war. It was the universal sentiment that no man could be so well\nsuited for this post as Mr. Edison himself. He was accordingly selected\nby the unanimous and enthusiastic choice of the great assembly.\n\n\"How long a time do you require to put everything in readiness?\" asked\nthe President.\n\n\"Give me _carte blanche_,\" replied Mr. Edison, \"and I believe I can have\na hundred electric ships and three thousand disintegrators ready within\nsix months.\"\n\nA tremendous cheer greeted this announcement.\n\n\"Your powers are unlimited,\" said the President, \"draw on the fund for\nas much money as you need,\" whereupon the Treasurer of the United States\nwas made the disbursing officer of the fund, and the meeting adjourned.\n\nNot less than 5,000,000 people had assembled at Washington from all\nparts of the world. Every one of this immense multitude had been able to\nlisten to the speeches and the cheers in the Senate Chamber, although\nnot personally present there. Wires had been run all over the city, and\nhundreds of improved telephonic receivers provided, so that everyone\ncould hear. Even those who were unable to visit Washington, people\nliving in Baltimore, New York, Boston, and as far away as New Orleans,\nSt. Louis and Chicago, had also listened to the proceedings with the aid\nof these receivers. Upon the whole, probably not less than 50,000,000\npeople had heard the deliberations of the great congress of the nations.\n\nThe telegraph and the cable had sent the news across the oceans to all\nthe capitols of the earth. The exultation was so great that the people\nseemed mad with joy.\n\nThe promised exhibition of the electrical ship took place the next day.\nEnormous multitudes witnessed the experiment, and there was a struggle\nfor places in the car. Even Queen Victoria, accompanied by the Prince of\nWales, ventured to take a ride in it, and they enjoyed it so much that\nMr. Edison prolonged the journey as far as Boston and the Bunker Hill\nmonument.\n\nMost of the other monarchs also took a high ride, but when the turn of\nthe Emperor of China came he repeated a fable which he said had come\ndown from the time of Confucius:\n\n\"Once upon a time there was a Chinaman living in the valley of the\nHoang-Ho River, who was accustomed frequently to lie on his back, gazing\nat, and envying, the birds that he saw flying away in the sky. One day\nhe saw a black speck which rapidly grew larger and larger, until as it\ngot near he perceived that it was an enormous bird, which overshadowed\nthe earth with its wings. It was the elephant of birds, the roc. 'Come\nwith me,' said the roc, 'and I will show you the wonders of the kingdom\nof the birds.' The man caught hold of its claw and nestled among its\nfeathers, and they rapidly rose high in the air, and sailed away to the\nKuen-Lun Mountains. Here, as they passed near the top of the peaks,\nanother roc made its appearance. The wings of the two great birds\nbrushed together, and immediately they fell to fighting. In the midst of\nthe melee the man lost his hold and tumbled into the top of a tree,\nwhere his pigtail caught on a branch, and he remained suspended. There\nthe unfortunate man hung helpless, until a rat, which had its home in\nthe rocks at the foot of the tree, took compassion upon him, and,\nclimbing up, gnawed off the branch. As the man slowly and painfully\nwended his weary way homeward, he said: 'This teaches me that creatures\nto whom nature has given neither feathers nor wings should leave the\nkingdom of the birds to those who are fitted to inhabit it.'\"\n\nHaving told this story, Tsait'ien turned his back on the electrical\nship.\n\nAfter the exhibition was finished, and amid the fresh outburst of\nenthusiasm that followed, it was suggested that a proper way to wind up\nthe Congress and give suitable expression to the festive mood which now\npossessed mankind would be to have a grand ball. This suggestion met\nwith immediate and universal approval.\n\nBut for so gigantic an affair it was, of course, necessary to make\nspecial preparations. A convenient place was selected on the Virginia\nside of the Potomac; a space of ten acres was carefully levelled and\ncovered with a polished floor, rows of columns one hundred feet apart\nwere run across it in every direction, and these were decorated with\nelectric lights, displaying every color of the spectrum.\n\nAbove this immense space, rising in the center to a height of more than\na thousand feet, was anchored a vast number of balloons, all aglow with\nlights, and forming a tremendous dome, in which brilliant lamps were\narranged in such a manner as to exhibit, in an endless succession of\ncombinations, all the national colors, ensigns and insignia of the\nvarious countries represented at the Congress. Blazing eagles, lions,\nunicorns, dragons and other imaginary creatures that the different\nnations had chosen for their symbols appeared to hover high above the\ndancers, shedding a brilliant light upon the scene.\n\nCircles of magnificent thrones were placed upon the floor in convenient\nlocations for seeing. A thousand bands of music played, and tens of\nthousands of couples, gayly dressed and flashing with gems, whirled\ntogether upon the polished floor.\n\nThe Queen of England led the dance, on the arm of the President of the\nUnited States.\n\nThe Prince of Wales led forth the fair daughter of the President,\nuniversally admired as the most beautiful woman on the great ballroom\nfloor.\n\nThe Emperor William, in his military dress, danced with the beauteous\nPrincess Masaco, the daughter of the Mikado, who wore for the occasion\nthe ancient costume of the women of her country, sparkling with jewels,\nand glowing with quaint combinations of color like a gorgeous butterfly.\n\nThe Chinese Emperor, with his pigtail flying high as he spun, danced\nwith the Empress of Russia.\n\nThe King of Siam essayed a waltz with the Queen Ranavalona of\nMadagascar, while the Sultan of Turkey basked in the smiles of a Chicago\nheiress to a hundred millions.\n\nThe Czar chose for his partner a dark-eyed beauty from Peru, but King\nMalietoa, of Samoa, was suspicious of civilized charmers and, avoiding\nall of their allurements, expressed his joy and gave vent to his\nenthusiasm in a _pas seul_. In this he was quickly joined by a band of\nSioux Indian chiefs, whose whoops and yells so startled the leader of a\nGerman band on their part of the floor that he dropped his baton, and\nfollowed by the musicians, took to his heels.\n\nThis incident amused the good-natured Emperor of China more than\nanything else that had occurred.\n\n\"Make muchee noisee,\" he said, indicating the fleeing musicians with his\nthumb. \"Allee samee muchee flaid noisee,\" and then his round face\ndimpled into another laugh.\n\nThe scene from the outside was even more imposing than that which\ngreeted the eye within the brilliantly lighted enclosure. Far away in\nthe night, rising high among the stars, the vast dome of illuminated\nballoons seemed, like some supernatural creation, too grand and glorious\nto have been constructed by the inhabitants of the earth.\n\nAll around it, and from some of the balloons themselves, rose jets and\nfountains of fire, ceasingly playing, and blotting out the\nconstellations of the heavens by their splendor.\n\nThe dance was followed by a grand banquet, at which the Prince of Wales\nproposed a toast to Mr. Edison:\n\n\"It gives me much pleasure,\" he said, \"to offer, in the name of the\nnations of the Old World, this tribute of our admiration for, and our\nconfidence in, the genius of the New World. Perhaps on such an occasion\nas this, when all racial differences and prejudices ought to be, and\nare, buried and forgotten, I should not recall anything that might\nrevive them; yet I cannot refrain from expressing my happiness in\nknowing that the champion who is to achieve the salvation of the earth\nhas come forth from the bosom of the Anglo-Saxon race.\"\n\nSeveral of the great potentates looked grave upon hearing the Prince of\nWales' words, and the Czar and the Kaiser exchanged glances; but there\nwas no interruption to the cheers that followed. Mr. Edison, whose\nmodesty and dislike to display and to speechmaking were well known,\nsimply said:\n\n\"I think we have got the machine that can whip them. But we ought not to\nbe wasting any time. Probably they are not dancing on Mars, but are\ngetting ready to make us dance.\"\n\nThese words instantly turned the current of feeling in the vast\nassembly. There was no longer any disposition to expend time in vain\nboastings and rejoicings. Everywhere the cry now became, \"Let us make\nhaste! Let us get ready at once! Who knows but the Martians have already\nembarked, and are now on their way to destroy us?\"\n\nUnder the impulse of this new feeling, which, it must be admitted, was\nvery largely inspired by terror, the vast ballroom was quickly deserted.\nThe lights were suddenly put out in the great dome of balloons, for\nsomeone had whispered:\n\n\"Suppose they should see that from Mars? Would they not guess what we\nwere about, and redouble their preparations to finish us?\"\n\nUpon the suggestion of the President of the United States, an executive\ncommittee, representing all the principal nations, was appointed, and\nwithout delay a meeting of this committee was assembled at the White\nHouse. Mr. Edison was summoned before it, and asked to sketch briefly\nthe plan upon which he proposed to work.\n\nI need not enter into the details of what was done at this meeting. Let\nit suffice to say that when it broke up, in the small hours of the\nmorning, it had been unanimously resolved that as many thousands of men\nas Mr. Edison might require should be immediately placed at his\ndisposal; that as far as possible all the great manufacturing\nestablishments of the country should be instantly transformed into\nfactories where electrical ships and disintegrators could be built, and\nupon the suggestion of Professor Sylvanus P. Thompson, the celebrated\nEnglish electrical expert, seconded by Lord Kelvin, it was resolved that\nall the leading men of science in the world should place their services\nat the disposal of Mr. Edison in any capacity in which, in his\njudgement, they might be useful to him.\n\nThe members of this committee were disposed to congratulate one another\non the good work which they had so promptly accomplished, when at the\nmoment of their adjournment, a telegraphic dispatch was handed to the\nPresident from Professor George E. Hale, the director of the great\nYerkes Observatory, in Wisconsin. The telegram read:\n\n\"Professor Barnard, watching Mars tonight with the forty-inch telescope,\nsaw a sudden outburst of reddish light, which we think indicates that\nsomething has been shot from the planet. Spectroscopic observations of\nthis moving light indicated that it was coming earthward, while visible,\nat the rate of not less than one hundred miles a second.\"\n\nHardly had the excitement caused by the reading of this dispatch\nsubsided, when others of a similar import came from the Lick\nObservatory, in California; from the branch of the Harvard Observatory\nat Arequipa, in Peru, and from the Royal Observatory, at Potsdam.\n\nWhen the telegram from this last named place was read the Emperor\nWilliam turned to his Chancellor and said:\n\n\"I want to go home. If I am to die I prefer to leave my bones among\nthose of my imperial ancestors and not in this vulgar country, where no\nking has ever ruled. I don't like this atmosphere. It makes me limp.\"\n\nAnd now, whipped on by the lash of alternate hope and fear, the earth\nsprang to its work of preparation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n_TO CONQUER ANOTHER WORLD_\n\n\nIt is not necessary for me to describe the manner in which Mr. Edison\nperformed his tremendous task. He was as good as his word, and within\nsix months from the first stroke of the hammer, a hundred electrical\nships, each provided with a full battery of disintegrators, were\nfloating in the air above the harbor and the partially rebuilt city of\nNew York.\n\nIt was a wonderful scene. The polished sides of the huge floating cars\nsparkled in the sunlight, and, as they slowly rose and fell, and swung\nthis way and that, upon the tides of the air, as if held by invisible\ncables, the brilliant pennons streaming from their peaks waved up and\ndown like the wings of an assemblage of gigantic humming birds.\n\nNot knowing whether the atmosphere of Mars would prove suitable to be\nbreathed by inhabitants of the earth, Mr. Edison had made provision, by\nmeans of an abundance of glass-protected openings, to permit the inmates\nof the electrical ships to survey their surroundings without quitting\nthe interior. It was possible by properly selecting the rate of\nundulation, to pass the vibratory impulse from the disintegrators\nthrough the glass windows of a car without damage to the glass itself.\nThe windows were so arranged that the disintegrators could sweep around\nthe car on all sides, and could also be directed above or below, as\nnecessity might dictate.\n\nTo overcome the destructive forces employed by the Martians no\nsatisfactory plan had yet been devised, because there was no means to\nexperiment with them. The production of those forces was still the\nsecret of our enemies. But Mr. Edison had no doubt that if we could not\nresist their efforts we might at least be able to avoid them by the\nrapidity of our motions. As he pointed out, the war machines which the\nMartians had employed in their invasion of the earth, were really very\nawkward and unmanageable affairs. Mr. Edison's electrical ships, on the\nother hand, were marvels of speed and of manageability. They could dart\nabout, turn, reverse their course, rise, fall, with the quickness and\nease of a fish in the water. Mr. Edison calculated that even if\nmysterious bolts should fall upon our ships we could diminish their\npower to cause injury by our rapid evolutions.\n\nWe might be deceived in our expectations, and might have overestimated\nour powers, but at any rate we must take our chances and try.\n\nA multitude, exceeding even that which had assembled during the great\ncongress in Washington, now thronged New York and its neighborhood to\nwitness the mustering and the departure of the ships bound for Mars.\nNothing further had been heard of the mysterious phenomenon reported\nfrom the observatories six months before, and which at the time was\nbelieved to indicate the departure of another expedition from Mars for\nthe invasion of the earth. If the Martians had set out to attack us they\nhad evidently gone astray; or, perhaps, it was some other world that\nthey were aiming at this time.\n\nThe expedition had, of course, profoundly stirred the interest of the\nscientific world, and representatives of every branch of science, from\nall the civilized nations, urged their claims to places in the ships.\nMr. Edison was compelled, from lack of room, to refuse transportation to\nmore than one in a thousand of those who now, on the plea that they\nmight be able to bring back something of advantage to science, wished to\nembark for Mars.\n\nOn the model of the celebrated corps of literary and scientific men\nwhich Napoleon carried with him in his invasion of Egypt, Mr. Edison\nselected a company of the foremost astronomers, archaeologists,\nanthropologists, botanists, bacteriologists, chemists, physicists,\nmathematicians, mechanics, meteorologists and experts in mining,\nmetallurgy and every other branch of practical science, as well as\nartists and photographers. It was but reasonable to believe that in\nanother world, and a world so much older than the earth as Mars was,\nthese men would be able to gather materials in comparison with which the\ndiscoveries made among the ruins of ancient empires in Egypt and\nBabylonia would be insignificant indeed.\n\nIt was a wonderful undertaking and a strange spectacle. There was a\nfeeling of uncertainty which awed the vast multitude whose eyes were\nupturned to the ships. The expedition was not large, considering the\ngigantic character of the undertaking. Each of the electrical ships\ncarried about twenty men, together with an abundant supply of compressed\nprovisions, compressed air, scientific apparatus and so on. In all,\nthere were about 2,000 men, who were going to conquer, if they could,\nanother world!\n\nBut though few in numbers, they represented the flower of the earth, the\nculmination of the genius of the planet. The greatest leaders in\nscience, both theoretical and practical, were there. It was the\nevolution of the earth against the evolution of Mars. It was a planet in\nthe hey-day of its strength matched against an aged and decrepit world\nwhich, nevertheless, in consequence of its long ages of existence, had\nacquired an experience which made it a most dangerous foe. On both sides\nthere was desperation. The earth was desperate because it foresaw\ndestruction unless it could first destroy its enemy. Mars was desperate\nbecause nature was gradually depriving it of the means of supporting\nlife, and its teeming population was compelled to swarm like the inmates\nof an overcrowded hive of bees, and find new homes elsewhere. In this\nrespect the situation on Mars, as we were well aware, resembled what had\nalready been known upon the earth, where the older nations overflowing\nwith population had sought new lands in which to settle, and for that\npurpose had driven out the native inhabitants, whenever those natives\nhad proven unable to resist the invasion.\n\nNo man could foresee the issue of what we were about to undertake, but\nthe tremendous powers which the disintegrators had exhibited and the\nmarvelous efficiency of the electrical ships bred almost universal\nconfidence that we should be successful.\n\nThe car in which Mr. Edison travelled was, of course, the flagship of\nthe squadron, and I had the good fortune to be included among its\ninmates. Here, besides several leading men of science from our own\ncountry, were Lord Kelvin, Lord Rayleigh, Professor Roentgen, Dr.\nMoissan--the man who first made artificial diamonds--and several others\nwhose fame had encircled the world. Each of these men cherished hopes of\nwonderful discoveries, along his line of investigation, to be made in\nMars.\n\nAn elaborate system of signals had, of course, to be devised for the\ncontrol of the squadron. These signals consisted of brilliant electric\nlights displayed at night and so controlled that by their means long\nsentences and directions could be easily and quickly transmitted.\n\nThe day signals consisted partly of brightly colored pennons and flags,\nwhich were to serve only when, shadowed by clouds or other obstructions,\nthe full sunlight could not fall upon the ship. This could naturally\nonly occur near the surface of the earth or of another planet.\n\nOnce out of the shadow of the earth we should have no more clouds and no\nmore night until we arrived at Mars. In open space the sun would be\ncontinually shining. It would be perpetual day for us, except as, by\nartificial means, we furnished ourselves with darkness for the purpose\nof promoting sleep. In this region of perpetual day, then, the signals\nwere also to be transmitted by flashes of light from mirrors reflecting\nthe rays of the sun.\n\nYet this perpetual day would be also, in one sense, a perpetual night.\nThere would be no more blue sky for us, because without an atmosphere\nthe sunlight could not be diffused. Objects would be illuminated only on\nthe side toward the sun. Anything that screened off the direct rays of\nsunlight would produce absolute darkness behind it. There would be no\ngraduation of shadow. The sky would be as black as ink on all sides.\n\nWhile it was the intention to remain as much as possible within the\ncars, yet since it was probable that necessity would arise for\noccasionally quitting the interior of the electrical ships, Mr. Edison\nhad provided for this emergency by inventing an air-tight dress\nconstructed somewhat after the manner of a diver's suit, but of much\nlighter material. Each ship was provided with several of these suits, by\nwearing which one could venture outside the ship even when it was beyond\nthe atmosphere of the earth.\n\nProvision had been made to meet the terrific cold which we knew would be\nencountered the moment we had passed beyond the atmosphere--that awful\nabsolute zero which men had measured by anticipation, but never yet\nexperienced--by a simple system of producing within the air-tight suits\na temperature sufficiently elevated to counteract the effects of the\nfrigidity without. By means of long, flexible tubes, air could be\ncontinually supplied to the wearers of the suits, and by an ingenious\ncontrivance a store of compressed air sufficient to last for several\nhours was provided for each suit, so that in case of necessity the\nwearer could throw off the tubes connecting him with the air tanks in\nthe car. Another object which had been kept in view in the preparation\nof these suits was the possible exploration of an airless planet, such\nas the moon.\n\nThe necessity of some contrivance by means of which we should be enabled\nto converse with one another while outside the cars in open space, or\nwhen in an airless world, like the moon, where there would be no medium\nby which the waves of sound could be conveyed as they are in the\natmosphere of the earth, had been foreseen by our great inventor, and he\nhad not found it difficult to contrive suitable devices for meeting the\nemergency.\n\nInside the headpiece of each of the electrical suits was the mouthpiece\nof a telephone. This was connected to a wire which, when not in use,\ncould be conveniently coiled upon the arm of the wearer. Near the ears,\nsimilarly connected with wires, were telephonic receivers.\n\nWhen two persons wearing the air-tight dresses wished to converse with\none another it was only necessary for them to connect themselves by the\nwires, and conversation could then be easily carried on.\n\nCareful calculations of the precise distance of Mars from the earth at\nthe time when the expedition was to start had been made by a large\nnumber of experts in mathematical astronomy. But it was not Mr. Edison's\nintention to go direct to Mars. With the exception of the first\nelectrical ship, which he had completed, none had yet been tried in a\nlong voyage. It was desirable that the qualities of each of the ships\nshould first be carefully tested, and for this reason the leader of the\nexpedition determined that the moon should be the first port of space at\nwhich the squadron would call.\n\nIt chanced that the moon was so situated at this time as to be nearly in\na line between the earth and Mars, which latter was in opposition to the\nsun, and consequently as favorably situated as possible for the purposes\nof the voyage. What would be, then, for 99 out of the 100 ships of the\nsquadron, a trial trip would at the same time be a step of a quarter of\na million of miles gained in the direction of our journey, and so no\ntime would be wasted.\n\nThe departure from the earth was arranged to occur precisely at\nmidnight. The moon near the full was hanging high over head, and a\nmarvelous spectacle was presented to the eyes of those below as the\ngreat squadron of floating ships, with their insignia lights ablaze,\ncast loose and began slowly to move away on their adventurous and\nunprecedented expedition into the great unknown. A tremendous cheer,\nbillowing up from the throats of millions of excited men and women,\nseemed to rend the curtain of the night, and made the airships tremble\nwith the atmospheric vibrations that were set in motion.\n\nInstantly magnificent fireworks were displayed in honor of our\ndeparture. Rockets by hundreds of thousands shot heaven-ward, and then\nburst in constellations of firey drops. The sudden illumination thus\nproduced, overspreading hundreds of square miles of the surface of the\nearth with a light almost like that of day, must certainly have been\nvisible to the inhabitants of Mars, if they were watching us at the\ntime. They might, or might not, correctly interpret its significance;\nbut, at any rate, we did not care. We were off, and were confident that\nwe could meet our enemy on his own ground before he could attack us\nagain.\n\nAnd now, as we slowly rose higher, a marvelous scene was disclosed. At\nfirst the earth beneath us, buried as it was in night, resembled the\nhollow of a vast cup of ebony blackness, in the center of which, like\nthe molten lava run together at the bottom of a volcanic crater, shone\nthe light of the illuminations around New York. But when we got beyond\nthe atmosphere, and the earth still continued to recede below us, its\naspect changed. The cup-shaped appearance was gone, and it began to\nround out beneath our eyes in the form of a vast globe--an enormous ball\nmysteriously suspended under us, glimmering over most of its surface,\nwith the faint illumination of the moon, and showing toward its eastern\nedge the oncoming light of the rising sun.\n\nWhen we were still further away, having slightly varied our course so\nthat the sun was once more entirely hidden behind the center of the\nearth, we saw its atmosphere completely illuminated, all around it, with\nprismatic lights, like a gigantic rainbow in the form of a ring.\n\nAnother shift in our course rapidly carried us out of the shadow of the\nearth and into that all pervading sunshine. Then the great planet\nbeneath us hung unspeakable in its beauty. The outlines of several of\nthe continents were clearly discernible on its surface, streaked and\nspotted with delicate shades of varying color, and the sunlight flashed\nand glowed in long lanes across the convex surface of the oceans.\nParallel with the Equator and along the regions of the ever blowing\ntrade winds, were vast belts of clouds, gorgeous with crimson and purple\nas the sunlight fell upon them. Immense expanses of snow and ice lay\nlike a glittering garment upon both land and sea around the North Pole.\n\nAs we gazed upon this magnificent spectacle, our hearts bounded within\nus. This was our earth--this was the planet we were going to defend--our\nhome in the trackless wilderness of space. And it seemed to us indeed a\nhome for which we might gladly expend our last breath. A new\ndetermination to conquer or die sprang up in our hearts, and I saw Lord\nKelvin, after gazing at the beauteous scene which the earth presented\nthrough his eyeglass, turn about and peer in the direction in which we\nknew that Mars lay, with a sudden frown that caused the glass to lose\nits grip and fall dangling from its string upon his breast. Even Mr.\nEdison seemed moved.\n\n\"I am glad I thought of the disintegrator,\" he said. \"I shouldn't like\nto see that world down there laid waste again.\"\n\n\"And it won't be,\" said Professor Sylvanus P. Thompson, gripping the\nhandle of an electric machine, \"not if we can help it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\n_THE FOOTPRINT ON THE MOON_\n\n\nTo prevent accidents, it had been arranged that the ships should keep a\nconsiderable distance apart. Some of them gradually drifted away, until,\non account of the neutral tint of their sides, they were swallowed up in\nthe abyss of space. Still it was possible to know where every member of\nthe squadron was through the constant interchange of signals. These, as\nI have explained, were effected by means of mirrors flashing back the\nlight of the sun.\n\nBut, although it was now unceasing day for us, yet, there being no\natmosphere to diffuse the sun's light, the stars were visible to us just\nas at night upon the earth, and they shone with extraordinary splendor\nagainst the intense black background of the firmament. The lights of\nsome of the more distant ships of our squadron were not brighter than\nthe stars in whose neighborhood they seemed to be. In some cases it was\nonly possible to distinguish between the light of a ship and that of a\nstar by the fact that the former was continually flashing while the star\nwas steady in its radiance.\n\nThe most uncanny effect was produced by the absence of atmosphere around\nus. Inside the car, where there was air, the sunlight, streaming through\none or more of the windows, was diffused and produced ordinary daylight.\n\nBut when we ventured outside we could only see things by halves. The\nside of the car that the sun's rays touched was visible, the other side\nwas invisible, the light from the stars not making it bright enough to\naffect the eye in contrast with the sun-illumined half.\n\nAs I held up my arm before my eyes, half of it seemed to be shaved off\nlengthwise; a companion on the deck of the ship looked like half a man.\nSo the other electrical ships near us appeared as half ships, only the\nillumined sides being visible.\n\nWe had now gotten so far away that the earth had taken on the appearance\nof a heavenly body like the moon. Its colors had become all blended into\na golden-reddish hue, which overspread nearly its entire surface, except\nat the poles, where there were broad patches of white. It was marvelous\nto look at this huge orb behind us, while far beyond it shone the\nblazing sun like an enormous star in the blackest of nights. In the\nopposite direction appeared the silver orb of the moon, and scattered\nall around were millions of brilliant stars, amid which, like fireflies,\nflashed and sparkled the signal lights of the squadron.\n\nA danger that might easily have been anticipated, that perhaps had been\nanticipated, but against which it had been difficult, if not impossible,\nto provide, presently manifested itself.\n\nLooking out of a window toward the right, I suddenly noticed the lights\nof a distant ship darting about in a curious curve. Instantly afterward,\nanother member of the squadron, nearer by, behaved in the same\ninexplicable manner. Then two or three of the floating cars seemed to be\nviolently drawn from their courses and hurried rapidly in the direction\nof the flagship. Immediately I perceived a small object, luridly\nflaming, which seemed to move with immense speed in our direction.\n\nThe truth instantly flashed upon my mind, and I shouted to the other\noccupants of the car:\n\n\"A meteor!\"\n\nAnd such indeed it was. We had met this mysterious wanderer in space at\na moment when we were moving in a direction at right angles to the path\nit was pursuing around the sun. Small as it was, and its diameter\nprobably did not exceed a single foot, it was yet an independent little\nworld, and as such a member of the solar system. Its distance from the\nsun being so near that of the earth, I knew that its velocity, assuming\nit to be travelling in a nearly circular orbit, must be about eighteen\nmiles in a second. With this velocity, then, it plunged like a\nprojectile shot by some mysterious enemy in space directly through our\nsquadron. It had come and was gone before one could utter a sentence of\nthree words. Its appearance, and the effect it had produced upon the\nships in whose neighborhood it passed, indicated that it bore an intense\nand tremendous charge of electricity. How it had become thus charged I\ncannot pretend to say. I simply record the fact. And this charge, it was\nevident, was opposite in polarity to that which the ships of the\nsquadron bore. It therefore exerted an attractive influence upon them\nand thus drew them after it.\n\nI had just time to think how lucky it was that the meteor did not strike\nany of us, when, glancing at a ship just ahead, I perceived that an\naccident had occurred. The ship swayed violently from its course,\ndazzling flashes played around it, and two or three of the men forming\nits crew appeared for an instant on its exterior, wildly gesticulating,\nbut almost instantly falling prone.\n\nIt was evident at a glance that the car had been struck by the meteor.\nHow serious the damage might be we could not instantly determine. The\ncourse of our ship was immediately altered, the electric polarity was\nchanged and we rapidly approached the disabled car.\n\nThe men who had fallen lay upon its surface. One of the heavy circular\nglasses covering a window had been smashed to atoms. Through this the\nmeteor had passed, killing two or three men who stood in its course.\nThen it had crashed through the opposite side of the car, and, passing\non, had disappeared into space. The store of air contained in the car\nhad immediately rushed out through the openings, and when two or three\nof us, having donned our air-tight suits as quickly as possible, entered\nthe wrecked car we found all its inmates stretched upon the floor in a\ncondition of asphyxiation. They, as well as those who lay upon the\nexterior, were immediately removed to the flagship, restoratives were\napplied, and, fortunately, our aid had come so promptly that the lives\nof all of them were saved. But life had fled from the mangled bodies of\nthose who had stood directly in the path of the fearful projectile.\n\n[Illustration: _\"Through this the meteor had passed, killing two or\nthree men who stood in its course.\"_]\n\nThis strange accident had been witnessed by several of the members of\nthe fleet, and they quickly drew together, in order to inquire for the\nparticulars. As the flagship was now overcrowded by the addition of so\nmany men to its crew, Mr. Edison had them distributed among the other\ncars. Fortunately it happened that the disintegrators contained in the\nwrecked car were not injured. Mr. Edison thought that it would be\npossible to repair the car itself, and for that purpose he had it\nattached to the flagship in order that it might be carried on as far as\nthe moon. The bodies of the dead were transported with it, as it was\ndetermined, instead of committing them to the fearful deep of space,\nwhere they would have wandered forever, or else have fallen like meteors\nupon the earth, to give them interment in the lunar soil.\n\nAs we now rapidly approached the moon the change which the appearance of\nits surface underwent was no less wonderful than that which the surface\nof the earth had presented in the reverse order while we were receding\nfrom it. From a pale silver orb, shining with comparative faintness\namong the stars, it slowly assumed the appearance of a vast mountainous\ndesert. As we drew nearer its colors became more pronounced; the great\nflat regions appeared darker; the mountain peaks shone more brilliantly.\nThe huge chasms seemed bottomless and blacker than midnight. Gradually\nseparate mountains appeared. What seemed like expanses of snow and\nimmense glaciers streaming down their sides sparkled with great\nbrilliancy in the perpendicular rays of the sun. Our motion had now\nassumed the aspect of falling. We seemed to be dropping from an\nimmeasurable height, and with an inconceivable velocity, straight down\nupon those giant peaks.\n\nHere and there curious lights glowed upon the mysterious surface of the\nmoon. Where the edge of the moon cut the sky behind it, it was broken\nand jagged with mountain masses. Vast crater rings overspread its\nsurface, and in some of these I imagined I could perceive a lurid\nillumination coming out of their deepest cavities, and the curling of\nmephitic vapors around their terrible jaws.\n\nWe were approaching that part of the moon which is known to the\nastronomers as the Bay of Rainbows. Here a huge semi-circular region, as\nsmooth almost as the surface of a prairie, lay beneath our eyes,\nstretching southward into a vast ocean-like expanse, while on the north\nit was enclosed by an enormous range of mountain cliffs, rising\nperpendicularly to a height of many thousands of feet, and rent and\ngashed in every direction by forces which seemed at some remote period\nto have labored at tearing this little world in pieces.\n\nIt was a fearful spectacle; a dead and mangled world, too dreadful to\nlook upon. The idea of the death of the moon was, of course, not a new\none to many of us. We had long been aware that the earth's satellite was\na body which had passed beyond the stage of life, if indeed it had ever\nbeen a life supporting globe; but none of us were prepared for the\nterrible spectacle which now smote our eyes.\n\nAt each end of the semi-circular ridge that encloses the Bay of Rainbows\nthere is a lofty promontory. That at the northwestern extremity had long\nbeen known to the astronomers under the name of Cape Laplace. The other\npromontory, at the southeastern termination, is called Cape Heraclides.\nIt was toward the latter that we were approaching, and by interchange of\nsignals all the members of the squadron had been informed that Cape\nHeraclides was to be our rendezvous upon the moon.\n\nI may say that I had been somewhat familiar with the scenery of this\npart of the lunar world, for I had often studied it from the earth with\na telescope, and I had thought that if there was any part of the moon\nwhere one might, with fair expectation of success, look for inhabitants,\nor if not inhabitants, at least for relics of life no longer existant\nthere, this would surely be the place. It was, therefore, with no small\ndegree of curiosity, notwithstanding the unexpectedly frightful and\nrepulsive appearance that the surface of the moon presented, that I now\nsaw myself rapidly approaching the region concerning whose secrets my\nimagination had so often busied itself. When Mr. Edison and I had paid\nour previous trip to the moon on our first experimental trip of the\nelectrical ship we had landed at a point on its surface remote from\nthis, and, as I have before explained, we then made no effort to\ninvestigate its secrets. But now it was to be different, and we were at\nlength to see something of the wonders of the moon.\n\nI had often on the earth drawn a smile from my friends by showing them\nCape Heraclides with a telescope, and calling their attention to the\nfact that the outline of the peak terminating the cape was such as to\npresent a remarkable resemblance to a human face, unmistakably a\nfeminine countenance, seen in profile, and possessing no small degree of\nbeauty. To my astonishment, this curious human semblance still remained\nwhen we had approached so close to the moon that the mountains forming\nthe cape filled nearly the whole field of view of the window from which\nI was watching it. The resemblance, indeed, was most startling.\n\n\"Can this indeed be Diana herself?\" I said half-aloud, but instantly\nafterward I was laughing at my fancy, for Mr. Edison had overhead me and\nexclaimed, \"Where is she?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Diana.\"\n\n\"Why, there,\" I said, pointing to the moon. But lo! the appearance was\ngone even while I spoke. A swift change had taken place in the line of\nsight by which we were viewing it, and the likeness had disappeared in\nconsequence.\n\nA few moments later my astonishment was revived, but the cause this time\nwas a very different one. We had been dropping rapidly toward the\nmountains, and the electrician in charge of the car was swiftly and\nconstantly changing his potential, and, like a pilot who feels his way\ninto an unknown harbor, endeavoring to approach the moon in such a\nmanner that no hidden peril should surprise us. As we thus approached I\nsuddenly perceived, crowning the very apex of the lofty peak near the\ntermination of the cape, the ruins of what appeared to be an ancient\nwatch tower. It was evidently composed of Cyclopean blocks larger than\nany that I had ever seen even among the ruins of Greece, Egypt and Asia\nMinor.\n\n[Illustration: _\"As we thus approached I suddenly perceived, crowning\nthe very apex of the lofty peak near the termination of the cape, the\nruins of what appeared to be the ancient watch-tower.\"_]\n\nHere, then, was visible proof that the moon had been inhabited, although\nprobably it was not inhabited now. I cannot describe the exultant\nfeeling which took possession of me at this discovery. It settled so\nmuch that learned men had been disputing about for centuries.\n\n\"What will they say,\" I exclaimed, \"when I show them a photograph of\nthat?\"\n\nBelow the peak, stretching far to right and left, lay a barren beach\nwhich had evidently once been washed by sea waves, because it was marked\nby long curved ridges such as the advancing and retiring tide leaves\nupon the shore of the ocean.\n\nThis beach sloped rapidly outward and downward toward a profound abyss,\nwhich had once, evidently, been the bed of a sea, but which now appeared\nto us simply as the empty, yawning shell of an ocean that had long\nvanished.\n\nIt was with no small difficulty, and only after the expenditure of\nconsiderable time, that all the floating ships of the squadron were\ngradually brought to rest on this lone mountain top of the moon. In\naccordance with my request, Mr. Edison had the flagship moored in the\ninterior of the great ruined watch tower that I have described. The\nother ships rested upon the slope of the mountain around us.\n\nAlthough time pressed, for we knew that the safety of the earth depended\nupon our promptness in attacking Mars, yet it was determined to remain\nhere at least two or three days in order that the wrecked car might be\nrepaired. It was found also that the passage of the highly electrified\nmeteor had disarranged the electrical machinery in some of the other\ncars, so that there were many repairs to be made besides those needed to\nrestore the wreck.\n\nMoreover, we must bury our unfortunate companions who had been killed by\nthe meteor. This, in fact, was the first work that we performed. Strange\nwas the sight, and stranger our feelings, as here on the surface of a\nworld distant from the earth, and on soil which had never before been\npressed by the foot of man, we performed that last ceremony of respect\nwhich mortals pay to mortality. In the ancient beach at the foot of the\npeak we made a deep opening, and there covered forever the faces of our\nfriends, leaving them to sleep among the ruins of empires, and among the\ngraves of races which had vanished probably ages before Adam and Eve\nappeared in Paradise.\n\nWhile the repairs were being made several scientific expeditions were\nsent out in various directions across the moon. One went westward to\ninvestigate the great ring of Plato, and the lunar Alps. Another crossed\nthe ancient Sea of Showers toward the inner Appenines.\n\nOne started to explore the immense Crater of Copernicus, which, yawning\nfifty miles across, presents a wonderful appearance even from the\ndistance of the earth. The ship in which I, myself, had the good fortune\nto embark, was bound for the mysterious inner mountain Aristarchus.\n\nBefore these expeditions started, a careful exploration had been made in\nthe neighborhood of Cape Heraclides. But, except that the broken walls\nof the watch tower on the peak, composed of blocks of enormous size, had\nevidently been the work of creatures endowed with human intelligence, no\nremains were found indicating the former presence of inhabitants upon\nthis part of the moon.\n\nBut along the shore of the old sea, just where the so-called Bay of\nRainbows separates itself from the abyss of the Sea of Showers, there\nwere found some stratified rocks in which the fascinated eyes of the\nexplorer beheld the clear imprint of a gigantic human foot, measuring\nfive feet in length from toe to heel.\n\nThe most minute search failed to reveal another trace of the presence of\nthe ancient giant, who had left the impress of his foot in the wet sands\nof the beach here so many millions of years ago that even the\nimagination of the geologists shrank from the task of attempting to fix\nthe precise period.\n\nAround this gigantic footprint gathered most of the scientific members\nof the expedition, wearing their oddly shaped air-tight suits, connected\nwith telephonic wires, and the spectacle, but for the impressiveness of\nthe discovery, would have been laughable in the extreme. Bending over\nthe mark in the rock, nodding their heads together, pointing with their\nawkwardly accoutered arms, they looked like an assemblage of\nantidiluvian monsters collected around their prey. Their disappointment\nover the fact that no other marks of anything resembling human\nhabitation could be discovered was very great.\n\nStill this footprint in itself was quite sufficient, as they all\ndeclared, to settle the question of the former habitation of the moon,\nand it would serve for the production of many a learned volume after\ntheir return to earth, even if no further discoveries should be made in\nother parts of the lunar world.\n\nIt was the hope of making such other discoveries that led to the\ndispatch of the other various expeditions which I have already named. I\nwas chosen to accompany the car that was going to Aristarchus, because,\nas every one who had viewed the moon from the earth was aware, there was\nsomething very mysterious about that mountain. I knew that it was a\ncrater nearly thirty miles in diameter and very deep, although its floor\nwas plainly visible.\n\nWhat rendered it remarkable was the fact that the floor and the walls of\nthe crater, particularly on the inner side, glowed with a marvelous\nbrightness which rendered them almost blinding when viewed with a\npowerful telescope.\n\nSo bright were they, indeed, that the eye was unable to see many of the\ndetails which the telescope would have made visible but for the flood of\nlight which poured from the mountains. Sir William Hershel had been so\ncompletely misled by this appearance that he supposed he was watching a\nlunar volcano in eruption.\n\nIt had always been a difficult question what caused the extraordinary\nluminosity of Aristarchus. No end of hypothesis had been invented to\naccount for it. Now I was to assist in settling these questions forever.\n\nFrom Cape Heraclides to Aristarchus the distance in air line was\nsomething over 300 miles. Our course lay across the northeastern part of\nthe Sea of Showers, with enormous cliffs, mountain masses and peaks\nshining on the right, while in the other direction the view was bounded\nby the distant range of the lunar Appenines, some of whose towering\npeaks, when viewed from our immense elevation, appeared as sharp as the\nSwiss Matterhorn.\n\nWhen we had arrived within about a hundred miles of our destination we\nfound ourselves, floating directly over the so-called Harbinger\nMountains. The serrated peaks of Aristarchus then appeared ahead of us,\nfairly blazing in the sunshine.\n\nIt seemed as if a gigantic string of diamonds, every one as great as a\nmountain peak, had been cast down upon the barren surface of the moon\nand left to waste their brilliance upon the desert air of this abandoned\nworld.\n\nAs we rapidly approached the dazzling splendor of the mountain became\nalmost unbearable to our eyes, and we were compelled to resort to the\ndevise, practised by all climbers of lofty mountains, where the glare of\nsunlight on snow surfaces is liable to cause temporary blindness, of\nprotecting our eyes with neutral-tinted glasses.\n\nProfessor Moissan, the great French chemist and maker of artificial\ndiamonds, fairly danced with delight.\n\n\"Voila! Voila! Voila!\" was all that he could say.\n\nWhen we were comparatively near, the mountain no longer seemed to glow\nwith a uniform radiance, evenly distributed over its entire surface, but\nnow innumerable points of light, all as bright as so many little suns,\nblazed away at us. It was evident that we had before us a mountain\ncomposed of, or at least covered with, crystals.\n\nWithout stopping to alight on the outer slopes of the great ring-shaped\nrange of peaks which composed Aristarchus, we sailed over their rim and\nlooked down into the interior. Here the splendor of the crystals was\ngreater than on the outer slopes, and the broad floor of the crater,\nthousands of feet beneath us, shone and sparkled with overwhelming\nradiance, as if it were an immense bin of diamonds, while a peak in the\ncenter flamed like a stupendous tiara incrusted with selected gems.\n\nEager to see what these crystals were, the car was now allowed rapidly\nto drop into the interior of the crater. With great caution we brought\nit to rest upon the blazing ground, for the sharp edges of the crystals\nwould certainly have torn the metallic sides of the car if it had come\ninto violent contact with them.\n\nDonning our air-tight suits and stepping carefully out upon this\nwonderful footing we attempted to detach some of the crystals. Many of\nthem were firmly fastened, but a few--some of astonishing size--were\nreadily loosened.\n\nA moment's inspection showed that we had stumbled upon the most\nmarvelous work of the forces of crystalization that human eyes had ever\nrested upon. Some time in the past history of the moon there had been an\nenormous outflow of molten material from the crater. This had overspread\nthe walls and partially filled up the interior, and later its surface\nhad flowered into gems, as thick as blossoms in a bed of pansies.\n\nThe whole mass flashed prismatic rays of indescribable beauty and\nintensity. We gazed at first speechless with amazement.\n\n\"It cannot be, surely it cannot be,\" said Professor Moissan at length.\n\n\"But it is,\" said another member of the party.\n\n\"Are these diamonds?\" asked a third.\n\n\"I cannot yet tell,\" replied the Professor. \"They have the brilliancy of\ndiamonds, but they may be something else.\"\n\n\"Moon jewels,\" suggested a third.\n\n\"And worth untold millions, whatever they are,\" remarked another. These\nmagnificent crystals, some of which appeared to be almost flawless,\nvaried in size from the dimensions of a hazelnut to geometrical solids\nseveral inches in diameter. We carefully selected as many as it was\nconvenient to carry and placed them in the car for future examination.\nWe had solved another long standing lunar problem and had, perhaps,\nopened up an inexhaustible future mine of wealth which might eventually\ngo far toward reimbursing the earth for the damage which it had suffered\nfrom the invasion of the Martians.\n\nOn returning to Cape Heraclides we found that the other expeditions had\narrived at the rendezvous ahead of us. Their members had wonderful\nstories to tell of what they had seen, but nothing caused quite so much\nastonishment as that which we had to tell and to show.\n\nThe party which had gone to visit Plato and the lunar Alps brought back,\nhowever, information which, in a scientific sense, was no less\ninteresting than what we had been able to gather.\n\nThey had found within this curious ring of Plato, which is a circle of\nmountains sixty miles in diameter, enclosing a level plain remarkably\nsmooth over most of its surface, unmistakable evidences of former\nhabitation. A gigantic city had evidently at one time existed near the\ncenter of this great plain. The outlines of its walls and the foundation\nmarks of some of its immense buildings were plainly made out, and\nelaborate plans of this vanished capitol of the moon were prepared by\nseveral members of the party.\n\nOne of them was fortunate enough to discover an even more precious relic\nof the ancient lunarians. It was a piece of petrified skullbone,\nrepresenting but a small portion of the head to which it had belonged,\nbut yet sufficient to enable the anthropologists, who immediately fell\nto examining it, to draw ideal representations of the head as it must\nhave been in life--the head of a giant of enormous size, which, if it\nhad possessed a highly organized brain, of proportionate magnitude, must\nhave given to its possessor intellectual powers immensely greater than\nany of the descendants of Adam have ever been endowed with.\n\nIndeed, one of the professors was certain that some little concretions\nfound on the interior of the piece of skull were petrified portions of\nthe brain matter itself, and he set to work with the microscope to\nexamine its organic quality.\n\nIn the meantime, the repairs to the electrical ships had been completed,\nand, although these discoveries on the moon had created a most profound\nsensation among the members of the expedition, and aroused an almost\nirresistable desire to continue the explorations thus happily begun, yet\neverybody knew that these things were aside from the main purpose in\nview, and that we should be false to our duty in wasting a moment more\nupon the moon than was absolutely necessary to put the ships in proper\ncondition to proceed on their warlike voyage.\n\nEverything being prepared then, we left the moon with great regret, just\nforty-eight hours after we had landed upon its surface, carrying with us\na determination to revisit it and to learn more of its wonderful secrets\nin case we should survive the dangers which we were now going to face.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\n_THE MONSTERS ON THE ASTEROID_\n\n\nA day or two after leaving the moon, we had another adventure with a\nwandering inhabitant of space which brought us into far greater peril\nthan had our encounter with the meteor.\n\nThe airships had been partitioned off so that a portion of the interior\ncould be darkened in order to serve as a sleeping chamber, wherein,\naccording to the regulations prescribed by the commander of the squadron\neach member of the expedition in his turn passed eight out of every\ntwenty-four hours--sleeping if he could, if not, meditating in a more or\nless dazed way, upon the wonderful things that he was seeing and\ndoing--things far more incredible than the creations of a dream.\n\nOne morning, if I may call by the name morning the time of my periodical\nemergence from the darkened chamber, glancing from one of the windows, I\nwas startled to see in the black sky a brilliant comet.\n\nNo periodical comet, as I knew, was at this time approaching the\nneighborhood of the sun, and no stranger of that kind had been detected\nfrom the observatories making its way sunward before we left the earth.\nHere, however, was unmistakably a comet rushing toward the sun, flinging\nout a great gleaming tail behind it and so close to us that I wondered\nto see it remaining almost motionless in the sky. This phenomenon was\nsoon explained to me, and the explanation was of a most disquieting\ncharacter.\n\nThe stranger had already been perceived, not only from the flagship, but\nfrom the other members of the squadron, and, as I now learned, efforts\nhad been made to get out of the neighborhood, but for some reason the\nelectrical apparatus did not work perfectly--some mysterious disturbing\nforce acting upon it--and so it had been found impossible to avoid an\nencounter with the comet, not an actual coming into contact with it, but\na falling into the sphere of its influence.\n\nIn fact, I was informed that for several hours the squadron had been\ndragging along in the wake of a comet, very much as boats are sometimes\ntowed off by a wounded whale. Every effort had been made to so adjust\nthe electric charge upon the ships that they would be repelled from the\ncometic mass, but, owing apparently to electric changes affecting the\nclashing mass of meteoric bodies which constituted the head of the\ncomet, we found it impossible to escape from its influence.\n\nAt one instant the ships would be repelled; immediately afterward they\nwould be attracted again, and thus they were dragged hither and thither,\nbut never able to break from the invisible leash which the comet had\ncast upon them. The latter was moving with enormous velocity toward the\nsun, and, consequently, we were being carried back again, away from the\nobject of our expedition, with a fair prospect of being dissipated in\nblazing vapors when the comet had dragged us, unwilling prisoners, into\nthe immediate neighborhood of the solar furnace.\n\nEven the most cool-headed lost his self control in this terrible\nemergency. Every kind of devise that experience or the imagination could\nsuggest was tried, but nothing would do. Still on we rushed with the\nelectrified atoms composing the tail of the comet swinging to and fro\nover the members of the squadron, as they shifted their position, like\nthe plume of smoke from a gigantic steamer, drifting over the sea birds\nthat follow in its course.\n\nWas this to end it all, then? Was this the fate that Providence had in\nstore for us? Were the hopes of the earth thus to perish? Was the\nexpedition to be wrecked and its fate to remain for ever unknown to the\nplanet from which it had set forth? And was our beloved globe, which had\nseemed so fair to us when we last looked upon it nearby, and in whose\ndefense we had resolved to spend our last breath, to be left helpless\nand at the mercy of its implacable foe in the sky?\n\nAt length we gave ourselves up for lost. There seemed to be no possible\nway to free ourselves from the baleful grip of this terrible and\nunlooked for enemy.\n\nAs the comet approached the sun its electrical energy rapidly increased,\nand watching it with telescopes, for we could not withdraw our\nfascinated eyes from it, we could clearly behold the fearful things that\nwent on in its nucleus.\n\nThis consisted of an immense number of separate meteors of no very great\nsize individually, but which were in constant motion among one another,\ndarting to and fro, clashing and smashing together, while fountains of\nblazing metallic particles and hot mineral vapours poured out in every\ndirection.\n\nAs I watched it, unable to withdraw my eyes, I saw imaginary forms\nrevealing themselves amid the flaming meteors. They seemed like\ncreatures in agony, tossing their arms, bewailing in their attitudes the\nawful fate that had overtaken them, and fairly chilling my blood with\nthe pantomime of torture which they exhibited. I thought of an old\nsuperstition which I had often heard about the earth, and exclaimed:\n\n\"Yes, surely, this is a flying hell!\"\n\nAs the electric activity of the comet increased, its continued changes\nof potential and polarity became more frequent, and the electrical ships\ndarted about with even greater confusion than before. Occasionally one\nof them, seized with a sudden impulse, would spring forward toward the\nnucleus of the comet with a sudden access of velocity that would fling\nevery one of its crew from his feet, and all would lie sprawling on the\nfloor of the car while it rushed, as it seemed, to inevitable and\ninstant destruction.\n\nThen, either through the frantic efforts of the electrician struggling\nwith the controller or through another change in the polarity of the\ncomet, the ship would be saved on the very brink of ruin and stagger\naway out of immediate danger.\n\nThus the captured squadron was swept, swaying and darting hither and\nthither, but never able to get sufficiently far from the comet to break\nthe bond of its fatal attraction.\n\nSo great was our excitement and so complete our absorption in the\nfearful peril that we had not noticed the precise direction in which the\ncomet was carrying us. It was enough to know that the goal of the\njourney was the furnace of the sun. But presently someone in the\nflagship recalled us to a more accurate sense of our situation in space\nby exclaiming:\n\n\"Why, there is the earth!\"\n\nAnd there, indeed, it was, its great globe rolling under our eyes, with\nthe contrasted colors of the continents and clouds and the watery gleam\nof the oceans spread beneath us.\n\n\"We're going to strike it!\" exclaimed somebody. \"The comet is going to\ndash us into the earth.\"\n\nSuch a collision at first seemed inevitable, but presently it was\nnoticed that the direction of the comet's motion was such that while it\nmight graze the earth it would not actually strike it.\n\nAnd so, like a swarm of giant insects circling about an electric light\nfrom whose magic influence they could not escape, our ships went on, to\nbe whipped against the earth in passing and then to continue their swift\njourney to destruction.\n\n\"Thank God, this saves us,\" suddenly cried Mr. Edison.\n\n\"What-what?\"\n\n\"Why, the earth, of course. Do you not see that as the comet sweeps\nclose to the great planet the superior attraction of the latter will\nsnatch us from its grasp, and that thus we shall be able to escape.\"\n\nAnd it was indeed as Mr. Edison had predicted. In a blaze of falling\nmeteors the comet swept the outer limits of the earth's atmosphere and\npassed on, while the swaying ships, having been instructed by signals\nwhat to do, desperately applied their electrical machinery to reverse\nthe attraction and threw themselves into the arms of their mother earth.\n\nIn another instant we were all free, settling down through the quiet\natmosphere with the Atlantic Ocean sparkling in the morning sun far\nbelow.\n\nWe looked at one another in amazement. So this was the end of our\nvoyage! This was the completion of our warlike enterprise. We had\nstarted out to conquer a world, and we had come back ignominiously\ndragged in the train of a comet.\n\nThe earth which we were going to defend and protect had herself turned\nprotector, and reaching out her strong arm had snatched her foolish\nchildren from the destruction which they had invited.\n\nIt would be impossible to describe the chagrin of every member of the\nexpedition.\n\nThe electric ships rapidly assembled and hovered high in the air, while\ntheir commanders consulted about what should be done. A universal\nfeeling of shame almost drove them to a decision not to land upon the\nsurface of the planet, and if possible not to let its inhabitants know\nwhat had occurred.\n\nBut it was too late for that. Looking carefully beneath us, we saw that\nfate had brought us back to our very starting point, and signals\ndisplayed in the neighborhood of New York indicated that we had already\nbeen recognized. There was nothing for us then but to drop down and\nexplain the situation.\n\nI shall not delay my narrative by undertaking to describe the\nastonishment and the disappointment of the inhabitants of the earth\nwhen, within a fortnight from our departure, they saw us back again,\nwith no laurels of victory crowning our brows.\n\nAt first they had hoped that we were returning in triumph, and we were\noverwhelmed with questions the moment we had dropped within speaking\ndistance.\n\n\"Have you whipped them?\"\n\n\"How many are lost?\"\n\n\"Is there any more danger?\"\n\n\"Faix, have ye got one of thim men from Mars?\"\n\nBut their rejoicing and their facetiousness were turned into wailing\nwhen the truth was imparted.\n\nWe made a short story of it, for we had not the heart to go into\ndetails. We told of our unfortunate comrades whom we had buried upon the\nmoon, and there was one gleam of satisfaction when we exhibited the\nwonderful crystals we had collected in the crater of Aristarchus.\n\nMr. Edison determined to stop only long enough to test the electrical\nmachinery of the cars, which had been more or less seriously deranged\nduring our wild chase after the comet, and then to start straight back\nfor Mars--this time on a through trip.\n\nThe astronomers, who had been watching Mars, since our departure, with\ntheir telescopes, reported that mysterious lights continued to be\nvisible, but that nothing indicating the starting of another expedition\nfor the earth had been seen.\n\nWithin twenty-four hours we were ready for our second start.\n\nThe moon was now no longer in a position to help us on our way. It had\nmoved out of line between Mars and the earth.\n\nHigh above us, in the center of the heavens, glowed the red planet which\nwas the goal of our journey.\n\nThe needed computations of velocity and direction of flight having been\nrepeated, and the ships being all in readiness, we started direct for\nMars.\n\nAn enormous charge of electricity was imparted to each member of the\nsquadron, in order that as soon as we had reached the upper limits of\nthe atmosphere, where the ships could move swiftly, without danger of\nbeing consumed by the heat developed by the friction of their passage\nthrough the air, a very great initial velocity could be imparted.\n\nOnce started off by this tremendous electrical kick, and with no\natmosphere to resist our motion, we should be able to retain the same\nvelocity, baring incidental encounters, until we arrived near the\nsurface of Mars.\n\nWhen we were free of the atmosphere, and the ships were moving away from\nthe earth, with the highest velocity which we were able to impart to\nthem, observations on the stars were made in order to determine the rate\nof our speed.\n\nThis was found to be ten miles in a second, or 864,000 miles in a day, a\nvery much greater speed than that with which we had travelled on\nstarting to touch at the moon. Supposing this velocity to remain\nuniform, and, with no known resistance, it might reasonably be expected\nto do so, we should arrive at Mars in a little less than forty-two days,\nthe distance of the planet from the earth being at this time, about\nthirty-six million miles.\n\nNothing occurred for many days to interrupt our journey. We became\naccustomed to our strange surroundings, and many entertainments were\nprovided to while away the time. The astronomers in the expedition found\nplenty of occupation in studying the aspects of the stars and the other\nheavenly bodies from their new point of view.\n\nAt the expiration of about thirty-five days we had drawn so near to Mars\nthat with our telescopes, which, though small, were of immense power, we\ncould discern upon its surface features and details which no one had\nbeen able to glimpse from the earth.\n\nAs the surface of this world, that we were approaching as a tiger hunter\ndraws near the jungle, gradually unfolded itself to our inspection,\nthere was hardly one of us willing to devote to sleep or idleness the\nprescribed eight hours that had been fixed as the time during which each\nmember of the expedition must remain in the darkened chamber. We were\ntoo eager to watch for every new revelation upon Mars.\n\nBut something was in store that we had not expected. We were to meet the\nMartians before arriving at the world in which they dwelt.\n\nAmong the stars which shone in that quarter of the heavens where Mars\nappeared as the master orb, there was one, lying directly in our path,\nwhich, to our astonishment, as we continued on, altered from the aspect\nof a star, underwent a gradual magnification, and soon presented itself\nin the form of a little planet.\n\n\"It is an asteroid,\" said somebody.\n\n\"Yes, evidently; but how does it come inside the orbit of Mars?\"\n\n\"Oh, there are several asteroids,\" said one of the astronomers, \"which\ntravel inside the orbit of Mars, along a part of their course, and, for\naught we can tell, there may be many which have not yet been caught\nsight of from the earth, that are nearer to the sun than Mars is.\"\n\n\"This must be one of them.\"\n\n\"Manifestly so.\"\n\nAs we drew nearer the mysterious little planet revealed itself to us as\na perfectly formed globe not more than five miles in diameter.\n\n\"What is that upon it?\" asked Lord Kelvin, squinting intently at the\nlittle world through his glass. \"As I live, it moves.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" exclaimed several others, \"there are inhabitants upon it,\nbut what giants!\"\n\n\"What monsters!\"\n\n\"Don't you see?\" exclaimed an excited savant. \"They are the Martians!\"\n\nThe startling truth burst upon the minds of all. Here upon this little\nplanetoid were several of the gigantic inhabitants of the world that we\nwere going to attack. There was more than one man in the flagship who\nrecognized them well, and who shuddered at the recognition,\ninstinctively recalling the recent terrible experience of the earth.\n\nWas this an outpost of the warlike Mars?\n\nAround these monstrous enemies we saw several of their engines of war.\nSome of these appeared to have been wrecked, but at least one, as far as\nwe could see, was still in a proper condition for use.\n\nHow had these creatures got there?\n\n\"Why, that is easy enough to account for,\" I said, as a sudden\nrecollection flashed into my mind. \"Don't you remember the report of the\nastronomers more than six months ago, at the end of the conference in\nWashington, that something would seem to indicate the departure of a new\nexpedition from Mars had been noticed by them? We have heard nothing of\nthat expedition since. We know that it did not reach the earth. It must\nhave fallen foul of this asteroid, run upon this rock in the ocean of\nspace and been wrecked here.\"\n\n\"We've got 'em, then,\" shouted our electric steersman, who had been a\nworkman in Mr. Edison's laboratory and had unlimited confidence in his\nchief.\n\nThe electrical ships were immediately instructed by signal to slow down,\nan operation that was easily affected through the electrical repulsion\nof the asteroid.\n\nThe nearer we got the more terrifying was the appearance of the gigantic\ncreatures who were riding upon the little world before us like castaway\nsailors upon a block of ice. Like men, and yet not like men, combining\nthe human and the beast in their appearance, it required a steady nerve\nto look at them. If we had not known their malignity and their power to\nwork evil, it would have been different, but in our eyes their moral\ncharacter shone through their physical aspect and thus rendered them\nmore terrible than they would otherwise have been.\n\nWhen we first saw them their appearance was most forlorn, and their\nattitudes indicated only despair and desperation, but as they caught\nsight of us their malign power of intellect instantly penetrated the\nmystery, and they recognized us for what we were.\n\nTheir despair immediately gave place to reawakened malevolence. On the\ninstant they were astir, with such heart-chilling movements as those\nthat characterize a venomous serpent preparing to strike.\n\nNot imagining that they would be in a position to make serious\nresistance, we had been somewhat incautious in approaching.\n\nSuddenly there was a quicker movement than usual among the Martians, a\nswift adjustment of that one of their engines of war which, as already\nnoticed, seemed to be practically uninjured, then there darted from it\nand alighted upon one of the foremost ships, a dazzling lightning stroke\na mile in length, at whose touch the metallic sides of the car curled\nand withered and, licked for a moment by what seemed lambent flames,\ncollapsed into a mere cinder.\n\nFor an instant not a word was spoken, so sudden and unexpected was the\nblow.\n\nWe knew that every soul in the stricken car had perished.\n\n\"Back! Back!\" was the signal instantly flashed from the flagship, and\nreversing their polarities the members of the squadron sprang away from\nthe little planet as rapidly as the electrical impulse could drive them.\n\nBut before we were out of reach a second flaming tongue of death shot\nfrom the fearful engine, and another of our ships, with all its crew,\nwas destroyed.\n\n[Illustration: _\"Back! Back!\" was the signal instantaneously flashed\nfrom the flag ship, and the members of the squadron sprang away from the\nlittle planet. But before we were out of reach a second tongue of death\nshot from the fearful engine, and another of our ships, with all its\ncrew, was destroyed._]\n\nIt was an inauspicious beginning for us. Two of our electrical ships,\nwith their entire crews, had been wiped out of existence, and this\nappalling blow had been dealt by a few stranded and disabled enemies\nfloating on an asteroid.\n\nWhat hope would there be for us when we came to encounter the millions\nof Mars itself on their own ground and prepared for war?\n\nHowever, it would not do to despond. We had been incautious, and we\nshould take good care not to commit the same fault again.\n\nThe first thing to do was to avenge the death of our comrades. The\nquestion whether we were able to meet these Martians and overcome them\nmight as well be settled right here and now. They had proved what they\ncould do, even when disabled and at a disadvantage. Now it was our turn.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\n_A PLANET OF GOLD_\n\n\nThe squadron had been rapidly withdrawn to a very considerable distance\nfrom the asteroid. The range of the mysterious artillery employed by the\nMartians was unknown to us. We did not even know the limit of the\neffective range of our own disintegrators. If it should prove that the\nMartians were able to deal their strokes at a distance greater than any\nwe could reach, then they would of course have an insuperable advantage.\n\nOn the other hand, if it should turn out that our range was greater than\ntheirs, the advantage would be on our side. Or--which was perhaps most\nprobable--there might be practically no difference in the effective\nrange of the engines.\n\nAnyhow, we were going to find out how the case stood, and that without\ndelay.\n\nEverything being in readiness, the disintegrators all in working order,\nand the men who were able to handle them, most of whom were experienced\nmarksmen, chosen from among the officers of the regular army of the\nUnited States, and accustomed to the straight shooting and the sure hits\nof the West, standing at their posts, the squadron again advanced.\n\nIn order to distract the attention of the Martians, the electrical ships\nhad been distributed over a wide space. Some dropped straight down\ntoward the asteroid; others approached it by flank attack, from this\nside and that. The flagship moved straight in toward the point where the\nfirst disaster occurred. Its intrepid commander felt that his post\nshould be that of the greatest danger, and where the severest blows\nwould be given and received.\n\nThe approach of the ships was made with great caution. Watching the\nMartians with our telescopes we could clearly see that they were\ndisconcerted by the scattered order of our attack. Even if all of their\nengines of war had been in proper condition for use it would have been\nimpossible for them to meet the simultaneous assault of so many enemies\ndropping down upon them from the sky.\n\nBut they were made of fighting mettle, as we knew from old experience.\nIt was no question of surrender. They did not know how to surrender, and\nwe did not know how to demand their surrender. Besides, the destruction\nof the two electrical ships with the forty men, many of whom bore names\nwidely known upon the earth, had excited a kind of fury among the\nmembers of the squadron which called for vengeance.\n\nSuddenly a repetition of the quick movement by the Martians, which had\nbeen the forerunner of the former coup, was observed; again a blinding\nflash burst from their war engines and instantaneously a shiver ran\nthrough the frame of the flagship; the air within quivered with strange\npulsations and seemed suddenly to have assumed the temperature of a\nblast furnace.\n\nWe all gasped for breath. Our throats and lungs seemed scorched in the\nact of breathing. Some fell unconscious upon the floor. The marksmen,\ncarrying the disintegrators ready for use, staggered, and one of them\ndropped his instrument.\n\nBut we had not been destroyed like our comrades before us. In a moment\nthe wave of heat passed; those who had fallen recovered from their\nmomentary stupor and staggered to their feet.\n\nThe electrical steersman stood hesitating at his post.\n\n\"Move on,\" said Mr. Edison sternly, his features set with determination\nand his eyes afire.\n\n\"We are still beyond their effective range. Let us get closer in order\nto make sure work when we strike.\"\n\nThe ship moved on. One could hear the heartbeats of its inmates. The\nother members of the squadron, thinking for the moment that disaster had\novertaken the flagship, had paused and seemed to be meditating flight.\n\n\"Signal them to move on,\" said Mr. Edison.\n\nThe signal was given, and the circle of electrical ships closed in upon\nthe asteroid.\n\nIn the meantime Mr. Edison had been donning his air-tight suit. Before\nwe could clearly comprehend his intention he had passed through the\ndouble trapped door which gave access to the exterior of the car without\npermitting the loss of air, and was standing upon what served as the\ndeck of the ship.\n\nIn his hand he carried a disintegrator. With a quick motion he sighted\nit.\n\nAs quickly as possible I sprang to his side. I was just in time to note\nthe familiar blue gleam about the instrument, which indicated that its\nterrific energies were at work. The whirring sound was absent, because\nhere, in open space, where there was no atmosphere, there could be no\nsound.\n\nMy eyes were fixed upon the Martian's engine, which had just dealt us a\nstaggering, but not fatal, blow, and particularly I noticed a polished\nknob projecting from it which seemed to have been the focus from which\nits destructive bolt emanated.\n\nA moment later the knob disappeared. The irresistible vibrations darted\nfrom the electrical disintegrator and had fallen upon it and\ninstantaneously shattered it into atoms.\n\n\"That fixes them,\" said Mr. Edison, turning to me with a smile.\n\nAnd indeed it did fix them. We had most effectually spiked their gun. It\nwould deal no more death blows.\n\nThe doings of the flagship had been closely watched throughout the\nsquadron. The effect of its blow had been evident to all, and a moment\nlater we saw, on some of the nearer ships, men dressed in their air\nsuits, appearing upon the deck, swinging their arms and sending forth\nsoundless cheers into empty space.\n\nThe stroke that we had dealt was taken by several of the electrical\nships as a signal for a common assault, and we saw two of the Martians\nfall beside the ruins of their engine, their heads having been blown\nfrom their bodies.\n\n\"Signal them to stop firing,\" commanded Mr. Edison. \"We have got them\ndown, and we are not going to murder them without necessity.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" he added, \"I want to capture some of them alive.\"\n\nThe signal was given as he had ordered. The flagship then alone dropped\nslowly toward the place on the asteroid where the prostrate Martians\nwere.\n\nAs we got near them a terrible scene unfolded itself to our eyes. There\nhad evidentially been not more than a half dozen of the monsters in the\nbeginning. Two of these were stretched headless upon the ground. Three\nothers had suffered horrible injuries where the invisible vibratory\nbeams from the disintegrators had grazed them, and they could not long\nsurvive. One only remained apparently uninjured.\n\n[Illustration: _As we got near them a terrible scene unfolded itself.\nTwo of the Martians were stretched headless upon the ground. Three\nothers had suffered horrible injuries, and only one remained apparently\nunhurt._]\n\nIt is impossible for me to describe the appearance of this creature in\nterms that would be readily understood. Was he like a man? Yes and no.\nHe possessed many human characteristics, but they were exaggerated and\nmonstrous in scale and in detail. His head was of enormous size, and his\nhuge projecting eyes gleamed with a strange fire of intelligence. His\nface was like a caricature, but not one to make the beholder laugh.\nDrawing himself up, he towered to a height of at least fifteen feet.\n\nBut let the reader not suppose from this inadequate description that the\nMartians stirred in the beholder precisely the sensation that would be\ncaused by the sight of a gorilla, or other repulsive inhabitant of our\nterrestrial jungles, suddenly confronting him in its native wilds.\n\nWith all his horrible characteristics, and all his suggestions of beast\nand monster, nevertheless the Martian produced the impression of being a\nperson and not a mere animal.\n\nI have already referred to the enormous size of his head, and to the\nfact that his countenance bore considerable resemblance to that of a\nman. There was something in his face that sent a shiver through the soul\nof the beholder. One could feel in looking upon it that here was\nintellect, intelligence developed to the highest degree, but in the\ndirection of evil instead of good.\n\nThe sensations of one who had stood face to face with Satan, when he was\ndriven from the battlements of heaven by the swords of his fellow\narchangels, and had beheld him transformed from Lucifer, the Son of the\nMorning, into the Prince of Night and Hell, might not have been unlike\nthose which we now experienced as we gazed upon this dreadful personage,\nwho seemed to combine the intellectual powers of a man, raised to their\nhighest pitch, with some of the physical features of a beast, and all\nthe moral depravity of a fiend.\n\nThe appearance of the Martian was indeed so threatening and repellent\nthat we paused at the height of fifty feet above the ground, hesitating\nto approach nearer. A grin of rage and hate overspread his face. If he\nhad been a man I should say he shook his fist at us. What he did was to\nexpress in even more telling pantomime his hatred and defiance, and his\ndetermination to grind us to shreds if he could once get us within his\nclutches.\n\nMr. Edison and I still stood upon the deck of the ship, where several\nothers had gathered around us. The atmosphere of the little asteroid was\nso rare that it practically amounted to nothing, and we could not\npossibly have survived if we had not continued to wear our air tight\nsuits. How the Martians contrived to live here was a mystery to us. It\nwas another of their secrets which we were yet to learn.\n\nMr. Edison retained his disintegrator in his hand.\n\n\"Kill him,\" said someone. \"He is too horrible to live.\"\n\n\"If we do not kill him we shall never be able to land upon the\nasteroid,\" said another.\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Edison. \"I shall not kill him. We have got another use\nfor him. Tom,\" he continued, turning to one of his assistants, whom he\nhad brought from his laboratory, \"bring me the anaesthetic.\"\n\nThis was something entirely new to nearly all the members of the\nexpedition. Mr. Edison, however, had confided to me before we left the\nearth the fact that he had invented a little instrument by means of\nwhich a bubble, strongly charged with a powerful anaesthetic agent,\ncould be driven to a considerable distance into the face of an enemy,\nwhere exploding without other damage, it would instantly put him to\nsleep.\n\nWhen Tom had placed the instrument in his hands Mr. Edison ordered the\nelectrical ship to forge slightly ahead and drop a little lower toward\nthe Martian, who, with watchful eyes and threatening gestures, noted our\napproach in the attitude of a wild beast on the spring. Suddenly Mr.\nEdison discharged from the instrument in his hand a little gaseous\nglobe, which glittered like a ball of tangled rainbows in the sunshine,\nand darted with astonishing velocity straight into the upturned face of\nthe Martian. It burst as it touched and the monster fell back senseless\nupon the ground.\n\n\"You have killed him!\" exclaimed all.\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Edison. \"He is not dead, only asleep. Now we shall drop\ndown and bind him tight before he can awake.\"\n\nWhen we came to bind our prisoner with strong ropes we were more than\never impressed with his gigantic stature and strength. Evidentially in\nsingle combat with equal weapons he would have been a match for twenty\nof us.\n\n[Illustration: _\"When we came to bind our prisoner with strong ropes\nwe were more than ever impressed with his gigantic stature and strength.\nHe might have been a match for twenty of us.\"_]\n\nAll that I had read of giants had failed to produce upon my mind the\nimpression of enormous size and tremendous physical energy which the\nsleeping body of this immense Martian produced. He had fallen on his\nback, and was in a most profound slumber. All his features were relaxed,\nand yet even in that condition there was a devilishness about him that\nmade the beholders instinctively shudder.\n\nSo powerful was the effect of the anaesthetic which Mr. Edison had\ndischarged into his face that he remained perfectly unconscious while we\nturned him half over in order the more securely to bind his muscular\nlimbs.\n\nIn the meantime the other electrical ships approached, and several of\nthem made a landing upon the asteroid. Everybody was eager to see this\nwonderful little world, which, as I have already remarked, was only five\nmiles in diameter.\n\nSeveral of us from the flagship started out hastily to explore the\nminiature planet. And now our attention was recalled to an intensely\ninteresting phenomenon which had engaged our thoughts not only when we\nwere upon the moon, but during our flight through space. This was the\nalmost entire absence of weight.\n\nOn the moon, where the force of gravitation is one-sixths as great as\nupon the earth, we had found ourselves astonishingly light. Five-sixths\nof our own weight, and of the weight of the air-tight suits in which we\nwere encased, had magically dropped from us. It was therefore\ncomparatively easy for us, encumbered, as we were, to make our way about\non the moon.\n\nBut when we were far from both the earth and the moon, the loss of\nweight was more astonishing still--not astonishing because we had not\nknown that it would be so, but nevertheless a surprising phenomenon in\ncontrast with our lifelong experience on the earth.\n\nIn open space we were practically without weight. Only the mass of the\nelectrical car in which we were enclosed attracted us, and inside that\nwe could place ourselves in any position without falling. We could float\nin the air. There was no up and no down, no top and no bottom for us.\nStepping outside the car, it would have been easy for us to spring away\nfrom it and leave it forever.\n\nOne of the most startling experiences that I have ever had was one day\nwhen we were navigating space about half way between the earth and Mars.\nI had stepped outside the car with Lord Kelvin, both of us, of course,\nwearing our air-tight suits. We were perfectly well aware what would be\nthe consequence of detaching ourselves from the car as we moved along.\nWe should still retain the forward motion of the car, and of course\naccompany it in its flight. There would be no falling one way or the\nother. The car would have a tendency to draw us back again by its\nattraction, but this tendency would be very slight, and practically\ninappreciable at a distance.\n\n\"I am going to step off,\" I suddenly said to Lord Kelvin. \"Of course I\nshall keep right along with the car, and step aboard again when I am\nready.\"\n\n\"Quite right on general principles, young man,\" replied the great\nsavant, \"but beware in what manner you step off. Remember, if you give\nyour body an impulse sufficient to carry it away from the car to any\nconsiderable distance, you will be unable to get back again, unless we\ncan catch you with a boathook or a fishline. Out there in empty space\nyou will have nothing to kick against, and you will be unable to propel\nyourself in the direction of the car, and its attraction is so feeble\nthat we should probably arrive at Mars before it had drawn you back\nagain.\"\n\nAll this was, of course, perfectly self-evident, yet I believe that but\nfor the warning words of Lord Kelvin I should have been rash enough to\nstep out into empty space, with sufficient force to have separated\nmyself hopelessly from the electrical ship.\n\nAs it was, I took good care to retain a hold upon a projecting portion\nof the car. Occasionally cautiously releasing my grip, I experienced for\na few minutes the delicious, indescribable pleasure of being a little\nplanet swinging through space, with nothing to hold me up and nothing to\ninterfere with my motion.\n\nMr. Edison, happening to come upon the deck of the ship at this time,\nand seeing what we were about at once said:\n\n\"I must provide against this danger. If I do not, there is a chance that\nwe shall arrive at Mars with the ships half empty and the crews floating\nhelplessly around us.\"\n\nMr. Edison's way of guarding against the danger was by contriving a\nlittle apparatus, modeled after that which was the governing force of\nthe electrical ships themselves, and which, being enclosed in the\nair-tight suits, enabled their wearers to manipulate the electrical\ncharge upon them in such a way that they could make excursions from the\ncars into open space like steam launches from a ship, going and\nreturning at their will.\n\nThese little machines being rapidly manufactured, for Mr. Edison had a\nminiature laboratory aboard, were distributed about the squadron, and\nhenceforth we had the pleasure of paying and receiving visits among the\nvarious members of the fleet.\n\nBut to return from this digression to our experience of the asteroid.\nThe latter being a body of some mass was, of course, able to impart to\nus a measurable degree of weight. Being five miles in diameter, on the\nassumption that its mean density was the same as that of the earth, the\nweight of bodies on its surface should have borne the same ratio to\ntheir weight upon the earth that the radius of the asteroid bore to the\nradius of the earth; in other words, as 1 to 1,600.\n\nHaving made this mental calculation, I knew that my weight, being 150\npounds on the earth, should on this asteroid be an ounce and a half.\n\nCurious to see whether fact would bear out theory, I had myself weighed\nwith a spring balance. Mr. Edison, Lord Kelvin and the other\ndistinguished scientists stood by watching the operation with great\ninterest.\n\nTo our complete surprise, my weight instead of coming out an ounce and a\nhalf, as it should have done, on the supposition that the mean density\nof the asteroid resembled that of the earth--a very liberal supposition\non the side of the asteroid, by the way--actually came out five ounces\nand a quarter!\n\n\"What in the world makes me so heavy?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, what an elephant you have become,\" said Mr. Edison.\n\nLord Kelvin screwed his eyeglass in his eye, and carefully inspected the\nbalance.\n\n\"It's quite right,\" he said. \"You do indeed weigh five ounces and a\nquarter. Too much; altogether too much,\" he added. \"You shouldn't do it,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the fault is in the asteroid,\" suggested Professor Sylvanus P.\nThompson.\n\n\"Quite so,\" exclaimed Lord Kelvin, a look of sudden comprehension\noverspreading his features. \"No doubt it is the internal constitution of\nthe asteroid which is the cause of the anomaly. We must look into that.\nLet me see? This gentleman's weight is three and one-half times as great\nas it ought to be. What element is there whose density exceeds the mean\ndensity of the earth in about that proportion?\"\n\n\"Gold,\" exclaimed one of the party.\n\nFor a moment we were startled beyond expression. The truth had flashed\nupon us.\n\nThis must be a golden planet this little asteroid. If it were not\ncomposed internally of gold it could never have made me weight three\ntimes more than I ought to weight.\n\n\"But where is the gold?\" cried one.\n\n\"Covered up, of course,\" said Lord Kelvin. \"Buried in Stardust. This\nasteroid could not have continued to travel for millions of years\nthrough legions of space strewn with meteoric particles without becoming\ncovered with the inevitable dust and grime of such a journey. We must\ndig now, and then doubtless we shall find the metal.\"\n\nThis hint was instantly acted upon. Something that would serve as a\nspade was seized by one of the men, and in a few minutes a hole had been\ndug in the comparatively light soil of the asteroid.\n\nI shall never forget the sight, nor the exclamations of wonder that\nbroke forth from all of us standing around, when the yellow gleam of the\nprecious metal appeared under the \"star dust.\" Collected in huge masses\nit reflected the light of the sun from its hiding place.\n\nEvidently the planet was not a solid ball of gold, formed like a bullet\nrun in a mold, but was composed of nuggets of various sizes, which had\ncome together here under the influence of their mutual gravitation, and\nformed a little metallic planet.\n\nJudging by the test of weight which we had already tried, and which had\nled to the discovery of the gold, the composition of the asteroid must\nbe the same to its very center.\n\nIn an assemblage of famous scientific men such as this the discovery of\ncourse, immediately led to questions as to the origin of this incredible\nphenomenon.\n\nHow did these masses of gold come together? How did it chance that, with\nthe exception of the thin crust of the asteroid nearly all its substance\nwas composed of the precious metal?\n\nOne asserted that it was quite impossible that there should be so much\ngold at so great a distance from the sun.\n\n\"It is the general law,\" he said, \"that the planets increase in density\ntowards the sun. There is every reason to think that the inner planets\npossess the greater amount of dense elements, while the outer ones are\ncomparatively light.\"\n\nBut another referred to the old theory that there was once in this part\nof the solar system a planet which had been burst in pieces by some\nmysterious explosion, the fragments forming what we know as the\nasteroids. In his opinion, this planet might have contained, a large\nquantity of gold, and in the course of ages the gold, having, in\nconsequence of its superior atomic weight, not being so widely scattered\nby the explosion as some of the other elements of the planet, had\ncollected itself together in this body.\n\nBut I observed that Lord Kelvin and the other more distinguished men of\nscience said nothing during this discussion. The truly learned man is\nthe truly wise man. They were not going to set up the theories without\nsufficient facts to substain them. The one fact that the gold was here\nwas all they had at present. Until they could learn more they were not\nprepared to theorize as to how the gold got there.\n\nAnd in truth, it must be confessed, the greater number of us really\ncared less for the explanation of the wonderful fact than we did for the\nfact itself.\n\nGold is a thing which may make its appearance anywhere and at any time\nwithout offering any excuses or explanations.\n\n\"Phew! Won't we be rich?\" exclaimed a voice.\n\n\"How are we going to dig it and get it back to earth?\" asked another.\n\n\"Carry it in your pockets,\" said one.\n\n\"No need of staking claims here,\" remarked another. \"There is enough for\neverybody.\"\n\nMr. Edison suddenly turned the current of talk.\n\n\"What do you suppose those Martians were doing here?\"\n\n\"Why, they were wrecked here.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" said Mr. Edison. \"According to your own showing they\ncould not have been wrecked here. This planet hasn't gravitation enough\nto wreck them by a fall, and besides I have been looking at their\nmachines and I know there has been a fight.\"\n\n\"A fight?\" exclaimed several, pricking up their ears.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Edison. \"Those machines bear the marks of the lightning\nof the Martians. They have been disabled, but they are made of some\nmetal or some alloy of metals unknown to me, and consequently they have\nwithstood the destructive force applied to them, as our electric ships\nwere unable to withstand it. It is perfectly plain to me that they have\nbeen disabled in a battle. The Martians must have been fighting among\nthemselves.\"\n\n\"About the gold!\" exclaimed one.\n\n\"Of course. What else was there to fight about?\"\n\nAt this instant one of our men came running from a considerable\ndistance, waving his arms excitedly, but unable to give voice to his\nstory, in the inappreciable atmosphere of the asteroid, until he had\ncome up and made telephonic connection with us.\n\n\"There are a lot of dead Martians over there,\" he said. \"They've been\ncleaning one another out.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said Mr. Edison. \"I knew it when I saw the condition of\nthose machines.\"\n\n\"Then this is not a wrecked expedition, directed against the earth?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"This must be the great gold mine of Mars,\" said the president of an\nAustralian mining company, opening both his eyes and his mouth as he\nspoke.\n\n\"Yes, evidently that's it. Here's where they come to get their wealth.\"\n\n\"And this,\" I said, \"must be their harvest time. You notice that this\nasteroid, being several million miles nearer to the sun than Mars is,\nmust have an appreciably shorter period of revolution. When it is in\nconjunction with Mars, or nearly so, as it is at present, the distance\nbetween the two is not very great, whereas when it is in the opposite\npart of its orbit they are separated by an enormous gap in space and the\nsun is between them.\n\n\"Manifestly in the latter case it would be perilous if not entirely\nimpossible for the Martians to visit the golden asteroid, but when it is\nnear Mars, as it is at present, and as it must be periodically for\nseveral years at a time, then is their opportunity.\n\n\"With their projectile cars sent forth with the aid of the mysterious\nexplosives which they possess, it is easy for them under such\ncircumstances, to make visits to the asteroid.\n\n\"Having obtained all the gold they need or all that they can carry, a\ncomparatively slight impulse given to their car, the direction of which\nis carefully calculated, will carry them back again to Mars.\"\n\n\"If that's so,\" exclaimed a voice, \"we had better look out for\nourselves! We have got into a very hornet's nest! If this is the place\nwhere the Martians come to dig gold, and if this is the height of their\nseason, as you say, they are not likely to leave us here long\nundisturbed.\"\n\n\"These fellows must have been pirates that they had the fight with,\"\nsaid another.\n\n\"But what's become of the regulars, then?\"\n\n\"Gone back to Mars for help, probably, and they'll be here again pretty\nquick, I am afraid!\"\n\nConsiderable alarm was caused by this view of the case, and orders were\nsent to several of the electrical ships to cruise out to a safe distance\nin the direction of Mars and keep a sharp outlook for the approach of\nenemies.\n\nMeanwhile our prisoner awoke. He turned his eyes upon those standing\nabout him, without any appearance of fear, but rather with a look of\ncontempt, like that which Gulliver must have felt for the Lilliputians\nwho had bound him under similar circumstances.\n\nThere were both hatred and defiance in his glance. He attempted to free\nhimself, and the ropes strained with the tremendous pressure that he put\nupon them, but he could not break loose.\n\nSatisfied that the Martian was safely bound, we left him where he lay,\nand, while awaiting news from the ships which had been sent to\nreconnoitre, continued the exploration of the little planet.\n\nAt a point nearly opposite to that where we had landed we came upon the\nmine which the Martians had been working. They had removed the thin\ncoating of soil, laying bare the rich stores of gold beneath, and large\nquantities of the latter had been removed. Some of it was so solidly\npacked that the strokes of the instruments by means of which they had\ndetached it were visible like the streaks left by a knife cutting\ncheese.\n\nThe more we saw of this golden planet the greater became our\nastonishment. What the Martians had removed was a mere nothing in\ncomparison with the entire bulk of the asteroid. Had the celestial mine\nbeen easier to reach, perhaps they would have removed more, or,\npossibly, their political economists perfectly understood the necessity\nof properly controlling the amount of precious metal in circulation.\nVery likely, we thought, the mining operations were under government\ncontrol in Mars and it might be that the majority of the people there\nknew nothing of this store of wealth floating in the firmament. That\nwould account for the battle with the supposed pirates, who, no doubt\nhad organized a secret expedition to the asteroid and had been caught\nred-handed at the mine.\n\nThere were many detached masses of gold scattered about, and some of the\nmen, on picking them up, exclaimed with astonishment at their lack of\nweight, forgetting for the moment that the same law which caused their\nown bodies to weigh so little must necessarily affect everything else in\na like degree.\n\nA mass of gold that on the earth no man would have been able to lift\ncould here be tossed about like a hollow rubber ball.\n\nWhile we were examining the mine, one of the men left to guard the\nMartian came running to inform us that the latter evidently wished to\nmake some communication. Mr. Edison and the others hurried to the side\nof the prisoner. He still lay on his back, from which position he was\nnot able to move, notwithstanding all his efforts. But by the motion of\nhis eyes, aided by the pantomime with his fingers, he made us understand\nthat there was something in a metallic box fastened at his side which he\nwished to reach.\n\nWith some difficulty we succeeded in opening the box and in it there\nappeared a number of bright red pellets, as large as an ordinary egg.\n\nWhen the Martians saw these in our hands he gave us to understand by the\nmotion of his lips that he wished to swallow one of them. A pellet was\naccordingly placed in his mouth, and he instantly and with great\neagerness swallowed it.\n\nWhile trying to communicate his wishes to us, the prisoner had seemed to\nbe in no little distress. He exhibited spasmodic movements which led\nsome of the bystanders to think that he was on the point of dying, but\nwithin a few seconds after he had swallowed the pellet he appeared to be\ncompletely restored. All evidence of distress vanished, and a look of\ncontent came over his ugly face.\n\n\"It must be a powerful medicine,\" said one of the bystanders. \"I wonder\nwhat it is?\"\n\n\"I will explain to you my notion,\" said Professor Moissan, the great\nFrench chemist. \"I think it was a pill of the air, which he has taken.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"My meaning is,\" said Professor Moissan, \"that the Martian must have,\nfor that he may live, the nitrogen and the oxygen. These can he not\nobtain here, where there is not the atmosphere. Therefore must he get\nthem in some other manner. This has he managed to do by combining in\nthese pills the oxygen and the nitrogen in the proportions which make\natmospheric air. Doubtless upon Mars there are the very great chemists.\nThey have discovered how this may be done. When the Martian has\nswallowed his little pill, the oxygen and the nitrogen are rendered to\nhis blood as if he had breathed them, and so he can live with that air\nwhich has been distributed to him with the aid of his stomach in place\nof his lungs.\"\n\nIf Monsieur Moissan's explanation was not correct, at any rate it seemed\nthe only one which would fit the facts before us. Certainly the Martian\ncould not breathe where there was practically no air, yet just as\ncertainly after he had swallowed his pill he seemed as comfortable as\nany of us.\n\nSuddenly, while we were gathered around the prisoner, and interested in\nthis fresh evidence of the wonderful ingenuity of the Martians, and of\ntheir control over the processes of nature, one of the electrical ships\nthat had been sent off in the direction of Mars was seen rapidly\nreturning and displaying signals.\n\nIt reported that the Martians were coming!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\n_\"THE MARTIANS ARE COMING!\"_\n\n\nThe alarm was spread instantly among those upon the planet and through\nthe remainder of the fleet.\n\nOne of the men from the returning electrical ship dropped down upon the\nasteroid and gave a more detailed account of what they had seen.\n\nHis ship had been the one which had gone to the greatest distance, in\nthe direction of Mars. While cruising there, with all eyes intent, they\nhad suddenly perceived a glittering object moving from the direction of\nthe ruddy planet, and manifestly approaching them. A little inspection\nwith the telescope had shown them that it was one of the projectile cars\nused by the Martians.\n\nOur ship had ventured so far from the asteroid that for a moment it\nseemed doubtful whether it would be able to return in time to give\nwarning, because the electrical influence of the asteroid was\ncomparatively slight at such a distance, and, after they had reversed\ntheir polarity, and applied their intensifier, so as to make that\ninfluence effective, their motion was at first exceedingly slow.\n\nFortunately after a time they got under way with sufficient velocity to\nbring them back to us before the approaching Martians could overtake\nthem.\n\nThe latter were not moving with great velocity, having evidently\nprojected themselves from Mars with only just sufficient force to throw\nthem within the feeble sphere of gravitation of the asteroid, so that\nthey should very gently land upon its surface.\n\nIndeed, looking out behind the electrical ship which had brought us the\nwarning, we immediately saw the projectile of the Martians approaching.\nIt sparkled like a star in the black sky as the sunlight fell upon it.\n\nThe ships of the squadron whose crews had not landed upon the planet\nwere signaled to prepare for action, while those who were upon the\nasteroid made ready for battle there. A number of disintegrators were\ntrained upon the approaching Martians, but Mr. Edison gave strict orders\nthat no attempt should be made to discharge the vibratory force at\nrandom.\n\n\"They do not know that we are here,\" he said, \"and I am convinced that\nthey are unable to control their motions as we can do with our\nelectrical ships. They depend simply upon the force of gravitation.\nHaving passed the limit of the attraction of Mars, they have now fallen\nwithin the attraction of the asteroid, and they must slowly sink to its\nsurface.\n\n\"Having, as I am convinced, no means of producing or controlling\nelectrical attraction and repulsion, they cannot stop themselves, but\nmust come down upon the asteroid. Having got here, they could never get\naway again, except as we know the survivors got away from earth, by\npropelling their projectile against gravitation with the aid of an\nexplosive.\n\n\"Therefore, to a certain extent they will be at our mercy. Let us allow\nthem quietly to land upon the planet, and then I think, if it becomes\nnecessary, we can master them.\"\n\nNotwithstanding Mr. Edison's reassuring words and manner, the company\nupon the asteroid experienced a dreadful suspense while the projectile\nwhich seemed very formidable as it drew near, sank with a slow and\ngraceful motion toward the surface of the ground. Evidently it was about\nto land very near the spot where we stood awaiting it.\n\nIts inmates had apparently just caught sight of us. They evinced signs\nof astonishment, and seemed at a loss exactly what to do. We could see\nprojecting from the fore part of their car at least two of the polished\nknobs, whose fearful use and power we well comprehended.\n\nSeveral of our men cried out to Mr. Edison in an extremity of terror:\n\n\"Why do you not destroy them? Be quick, or we shall all perish.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Edison, \"there is no danger. You can see that they are\nnot prepared. They will not attempt to attack us until they have made\ntheir landing.\"\n\nAnd Mr. Edison was right. With gradually accelerated velocity, and yet\nvery, very slowly in comparison with the speed they would have exhibited\nin falling upon such a planet as the earth, the Martians and their car\ncame down to the ground.\n\nWe stood at a distance of perhaps three hundred feet from the point\nwhere they touched the asteroid. Instantly a dozen of the giants sprang\nfrom the car and gazed about for a moment with a look of intense\nsurprise. At first it was doubtful whether they meant to attack us at\nall.\n\nWe stood on our guard, several carrying disintegrators in our hands,\nwhile a score more of these terrible engines were turned upon the\nMartians from the electrical ships which hovered near.\n\nSuddenly he who seemed to be the leader of the Martians began to speak\nto them in pantomime, using his fingers after the manner in which they\nare used for conversation by deaf and dumb people.\n\nOf course, we did not know what he was saying, but his meaning became\nperfectly evident a minute later. Clearly they did not comprehend the\npowers of the insignificant looking strangers with whom they had to\ndeal. Instead of turning their destructive engines on us, they advanced\non a run, with the evident purpose of making us prisoners or crushing us\nby main force.\n\nThe soft whirr of the disintegrator in the hands of Mr. Edison standing\nnear me came to my ears through the telephonic wire. He quickly swept\nthe concentrating mirror a little up and down, and instantly the\nforemost Martian vanished! Part of some metallic dress that he wore fell\nupon the ground where he had stood, its vibratory rate not having been\nincluded in the range imparted to the disintegrator.\n\nHis followers paused for a moment, amazed, stared about as if looking\nfor their leader, and then hurried back to their projectile and\ndisappeared within it.\n\n\"Now we've got business on our hands,\" said Mr. Edison. \"Look out for\nyourselves.\"\n\nAs he spoke, I saw the death-dealing knob of the war engine contained in\nthe car of the Martians moving around toward us. In another instant it\nwould have launched its destroying bolt.\n\nBefore that could occur, however, it had been dissipated into space by a\nvibratory stream from a disintegrator.\n\nBut we were not to get the victory quite so easily. There was another of\nthe war engines in the car, and before we could concentrate our fire\nupon it, its awful flash shot forth, and a dozen of our comrades\nperished before our eyes.\n\n\"Quick! Quick!\" shouted Mr. Edison to one of his electrical experts\nstanding near. \"There is something the matter with this disintegrator,\nand I cannot make it work. Aim at the knob, and don't miss it.\"\n\nBut the aim was not well taken, and the vibratory force fell upon a\nportion of the car at a considerable distance from the knob, making a\ngreat breach, but leaving the engine uninjured.\n\nA section of the side of the car had been destroyed, and the vibratory\nenergy had spread no further. To have attempted to sweep the car from\nend to end would have been futile, because the period of action of the\ndisintegrators during each discharge did not exceed one second, and\ndistributing the energy over so great a space would have seriously\nweakened its power to shatter apart the atoms of the resisting\nsubstance. The disintegrators were like firearms, in that after each\ndischarge they must be readjusted before they could be used again.\n\nThrough the breach we saw the Martians inside making desperate efforts\nto train their engine upon us, for after their first disastrous stroke\nwe had rapidly shifted our position. Swiftly the polished knob, which\ngleamed like an evil eye, moved round to sweep over us. Instinctively,\nthough incautiously, we had collected in a group.\n\nA single discharge would sweep us all into eternity.\n\n\"Will no one fire upon them?\" exclaimed Mr. Edison, struggling with the\ndisintegrator in his hands which still refused to work.\n\nAt this fearful moment I glanced around upon our company, and was\nastonished at the spectacle. In the presence of the danger many of them\nhad lost all self-command. A half dozen had dropped their disintegrators\nupon the ground. Others stood as if frozen fast in their tracks. The\nexpert electrician, whose poor aim had had such disastrous results, held\nin his hand an instrument which was in perfect condition, yet with mouth\nagape, he stood trembling like a captured bird.\n\nIt was a disgraceful exhibition. Mr. Edison, however, had not lost his\nhead. Again and again he sighted at the dreadful knob with his\ndisintegrator, but the vibratory force refused to respond.\n\nThe means of safety were in our hands, and yet through a combination of\nill luck and paralyzing terror, we seemed unable to use them.\n\nIn a second more it would be all over with us.\n\nThe suspense in reality lasted only during the twinkling of an eye,\nthough it seemed ages long.\n\nUnable to endure it, I sharply struck the shoulder of the paralyzed\nelectrician. To have attempted to seize the disintegrator from his hands\nwould have been a fatal waste of time. Luckily the blow either roused\nhim from his stupor or caused an instinctive movement of his hand that\nset the little engine in operation.\n\nI am sure he took no aim, but providentially the vibratory force fell\nupon the desired point, and the knob disappeared.\n\nWe were saved!\n\nInstantly half a dozen rushed toward the car of the Martians. We\nbitterly repented their haste; they did not live to repent.\n\nUnknown to us the Martians carried hand engines, capable of launching\nbolts of death of the same character as those which emanated from the\nknobs of their larger machines. With these they fired, so to speak,\nthrough the breach in their car, and four of our men who were rushing\nupon them fell in heaps of cinders. The effect of the terrible fire was\nlike that which the most powerful strokes of lightning occasionally\nproduce on earth.\n\nThe destruction of the threatening knob had instantaneously relieved the\npressure upon the terror-stricken nerves of our company, and they had\nall regained their composure and self-command. But this new and\nunexpected disaster, following so close upon the fear which had recently\noverpowered them, produced a second panic, the effect of which was not\nto stiffen them in their tracks as before, but to send them scurrying in\nevery direction in search of hiding places.\n\nAnd now a most curious effect of the smallness of the planet we were on\nbegan to play a conspicuous part in our adventures. Standing on a globe\nonly five miles in diameter was like being on the summit of a mountain\nwhose sides sloped rapidly off in every direction, disappearing in the\nblack sky on all sides, as if it were some stupendous peak rising out of\nan unfathomable abyss.\n\nIn consequence of the quick rounding off of the sides of this globe, the\nline of the horizon was close at hand, and by running a distance of less\nthat 250 yards the fugitives disappeared down the sides of the asteroid,\nand behind the horizon, even from the elevation of about fifteen feet\nfrom which the Martians were able to watch them. From our sight they\ndisappeared much sooner.\n\nThe slight attraction of the planet and their consequent almost entire\nlack of weight enabled the men to run with immense speed. The result, as\nI have subsequently learned, was that after they had disappeared from\nour view they quitted the planet entirely, the force being sufficient to\npartially free them from its gravitation, so that they sailed out into\nspace, whirling helplessly end over end, until the elliptical orbits in\nwhich they travelled eventually brought them back again to the planet on\nthe side nearly opposite to that from which they had departed.\n\nBut several of us, with Mr. Edison, stood fast, watching for an\nopportunity to get the Martians within range of the disintegrators.\nLuckily we were enabled, by shifting our position a little to the left,\nto get out of the line of sight of our enemies concealed in the car.\n\n\"If we cannot catch sight of them,\" said Mr. Edison, \"we shall have to\nriddle the car on the chance of hitting them.\"\n\n\"It will be like firing into a bush to kill a hidden bear,\" said one of\nthe party.\n\nBut help came from a quarter which was unexpected to us, although it\nshould not have been so. Several of the electric ships had been hovering\nabove us during the fight, their commanders being apparently uncertain\nhow to act--fearful, perhaps, of injuring us in the attempt to smite our\nenemy.\n\nBut now the situation apparently lightened for them. They saw that we\nwere at an immense disadvantage, and several of them immediately turned\ntheir batteries upon the car of the Martians.\n\nThey riddled it far more quickly and effectively than we could have\ndone. Every stroke of the vibratory emanation made a gap in the side of\nthe car, and we could perceive from the commotion within that our\nenemies were being rapidly massacred in their fortification.\n\nSo overwhelming was the force and the advantage of the ships that in a\nlittle while it was all over. Mr. Edison signaled them to stop firing\nbecause it was plain that all resistance had ceased and probably not one\nof the Martians remained alive.\n\nWe now approached the car, which had been transpierced in every\ndirection, and whose remaining portions were glowing with heat in\nconsequence of the spreading of the atomic vibrations. Immediately we\ndiscovered that all our anticipations were correct and that all of our\nenemies had perished.\n\nThe effect of the disintegrators upon them had been awful--too\nrepulsive, indeed, to be described in detail. Some of the bodies had\nevidently entirely vanished; only certain metal articles which they had\nworn remaining, as in the case of the first Martian killed, to indicate\nthat such beings had ever existed. The nature of the metal composing\nthese articles was unknown to us. Evidently its vibratory rhythm did not\ncorrespond with any included in the ordinary range of the\ndisintegrators.\n\nSome of the giants had been only partially destroyed, the vibratory\ncurrent having grazed them, in such a manner that the shattering\nundulations had not acted upon the entire body.\n\nOne thing that lends a peculiar horror to a terrestrial battlefield was\nabsent; there was no bloodshed. The vibratory energy, not only\ncompletely destroyed whatever it fell upon but it seared the veins and\narteries of the dismembered bodies so that there was no sanguinary\nexhibition connected with its murderous work.\n\nAll this time the shackled Martian had lain on his back where we had\nleft him bound. What his feeling must have been may be imagined. At\ntimes, I caught a glimpse of his eyes, wildly rolling and exhibiting,\nwhen he saw that the victory was in our hands, the first indications of\nfear and terror shaking his soul that had yet appeared.\n\n\"That fellow is afraid at last,\" I said to Mr. Edison.\n\n\"Well, I should think he ought to be afraid,\" was the reply.\n\n\"So he ought, but if I am not mistaken this fear of his may be the\nbeginning of a new discovery for us.\"\n\n\"How so?\" asked Mr. Edison.\n\n\"In this way. When once he fears our power, and perceives that there\nwould be no hope of contending against us, even if he were at liberty,\nhe will respect us. This change in his mental attitude may tend to make\nhim communicative. I do not see why we should despair of learning his\nlanguage from him, and having done that, he will serve as our guide and\ninterpreter, and will be of incalculable advantage to us when we have\narrived at Mars.\"\n\n\"Capital! Capital!\" said Mr. Edison. \"We must concentrate the linguistic\ngenius of our company upon that problem at once.\"\n\nIn the meantime some of the skulkers whose flight I have referred to\nbegan to return, crestfallen, but rejoicing in the disappearance of the\ndanger. Several of them, I am ashamed to say, had been army officers.\nYet possibly some excuse could be made for the terror by which they had\nbeen overcome. No man has a right to hold his fellow beings to account\nfor the line of conduct they may pursue under circumstances which are\nnot only entirely unexampled in their experience, but almost beyond the\npower of the imagination to picture.\n\nParalyzing terror had evidently seized them with the sudden\ncomprehension of the unprecedented singularity of their situation.\nMillions of miles away from the earth, confronted on an asteroid by\nthese diabolical monsters from a maleficent planet, who were on the\npoint of destroying them with a strange torment of death--perhaps it was\nreally more than human nature, deprived of the support of human\nsurroundings, could be expected to bear.\n\nThose who, as already described, had run with so great a speed that they\nwere projected, all unwilling, into space, rising in elliptical orbits\nfrom the surface of the planet, describing great curves in what might be\ndenominated its sky, and then coming back again to the little globe on\nanother side, were so filled with the wonders of their remarkable\nadventure that they had almost forgotten the terror which had inspired\nit.\n\nThere was nothing surprising in what had occurred to them the moment one\nconsidered the laws of gravitation on the asteroid, but their stories\naroused an intense interest among all who listened to them.\n\nLord Kelvin was particularly interested, and while Mr. Edison was\nhastening preparations to quit the asteroid and resume our voyage to\nMars, Lord Kelvin and a number of other scientific men instituted a\nseries of remarkable experiments.\n\nIt was one of the most laughable things imaginable to see Lord Kelvin,\ndressed in his air-tight suit, making tremendous jumps in empty space.\nIt reminded me forcibly of what Lord Kelvin, then plain William\nThompson, and Professor Blackburn had done when spending a summer\nvacation at the seaside, while they were undergraduates of Cambridge\nUniversity. They had spent all their time, to the surprise of onlookers,\nin spinning rounded stones on the beach, their object being to obtain a\npractical solution of the mathematical problem of \"precession.\"\n\nImmediately Lord Kelvin was imitated by a dozen others. With what seemed\nvery slight effort they projected themselves straight upwards, rising to\na height of four hundred feet or more, and then slowly settling back\nagain to the surface of the asteroid. The time of rise and fall combined\nwas between three and four minutes.\n\nOn this little planet the acceleration of gravity or the velocity\nacquired by a falling body in one second was only four-fifths of an\ninch. A body required an entire minute to fall a distance of only 120\nfeet. Consequently, it was more like gradually settling than falling.\nThe figures of these men of science, rising and sinking in this manner,\nappeared like so many gigantic marionettes bobbing up and down in a\npneumatic bottle.\n\n\"Let us try that,\" said Mr. Edison, very much interested in the\nexperiments.\n\nBoth of us jumped together. At first, with great swiftness, but\ngradually losing speed, we rose to an immense height straight from the\nground. When we had reached the utmost limit of our flight we seemed to\ncome to rest for a moment, and then began slowly, but with accelerated\nvelocity, to sink back again to the planet. It was not only a peculiar\nbut a delicious sensation, and but for strict orders which were issued\nthat the electrical ships should be immediately prepared for departure,\nour entire company might have remained for an indefinite period enjoying\nthis new kind of athletic exercise in a world where gravitation had\nbecome so humble that it could be trifled with.\n\nWhile the final preparations for departure were being made, Lord Kelvin\ninstituted other experiments that were no less unique in their results.\nThe experience of those who had taken unpremeditated flights in\nelliptical orbits when they had run from the vicinity of the Martians\nsuggested the throwing of solid objects in various directions from the\nsurface of the planet in order to determine the distance they would go\nand the curves they would describe in returning.\n\nFor these experiments there was nothing more convenient or abundant than\nchunks of gold from the Martians' mine. These, accordingly, were hurled\nin different directions and with every degree of velocity. A little\ncalculation had shown that an initial velocity of thirty feet per second\nimparted to one of these chunks, moving at right angles to the radius of\nthe asteroid, would, if the resistance of an almost inappreciable\natmosphere were neglected, suffice to turn the piece of gold into a\nlittle satellite that would describe an orbit around the asteroid, and\ncontinue to do so forever, or at least until the slight atmospheric\nresistance should eventually bring it down to the surface.\n\nBut a less velocity than thirty feet per second would cause the golden\nmissile to fly only part way around, while a greater velocity would give\nit an elliptical instead of a circular orbit, and in this ellipse it\nwould continue to revolve around the asteroid in the character of a\nsatellite.\n\nIf the direction of the original impulse were at more than a right angle\nto the radius of the asteroid, then the flying body would pass out to a\ngreater or less distance in space in an elliptical orbit, eventually\ncoming back again and falling upon the asteroid, but not at the same\nspot from which it had departed.\n\nSo many took part in these singular experiments, which assumed rather\nthe appearance of outdoor sports than of scientific demonstrations, that\nin a short time we had provided the asteroid with a very large number of\nlittle moons, or satellites, of gold, which revolved around it in orbits\nof various degrees of ellipticity, taking, on the average, about\nthree-quarters of an hour to complete a circuit. Since, on completing a\nrevolution, they must necessarily pass through the point from which they\nstarted, they kept us constantly on the _qui vive_ to avoid being\nknocked over by them as they swept around in their orbits.\n\nFinally the signal was given for all to embark, and with great regret\nthe savants quitted their scientific games, and prepared to return to\nthe electric ships.\n\nJust on the moment of departure, the fact was announced by one, who had\nbeen making a little calculation on a bit of paper, that the velocity\nwith which a body must be thrown in order to escape forever the\nattraction of the asteroid, and to pass on to an infinite distance in\nany direction, was only about forty-two feet in a second.\n\nManifestly it would be quite easy to impart such a speed as that to the\nchunks of gold that we held in our hands.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" exclaimed one. \"Let's send some of this back to the earth.\"\n\n\"Where is the earth?\" asked another.\n\nBeing appealed to, several astronomers turned their eyes in the\ndirection of the sun, where the black firmament was ablaze with stars,\nand in a moment recognized the earth-star shining there, with the moon\nattending close at hand.\n\n\"There,\" said one, \"is the earth. Can you throw straight enough to hit\nit?\"\n\n\"We'll try,\" was the reply, and immediately several threw huge golden\nnuggets in the direction of our far-away world, endeavoring to impart to\nthem at least the required velocity of forty-two feet in a second, which\nwould insure their passing beyond the attraction of the asteroid, and if\nthere should be no disturbance on the way, and the aim were accurate,\ntheir eventual arrival upon the earth.\n\n\"Here's for you, Old Earth,\" said one of the throwers, \"good luck, and\nmore gold to you!\"\n\nIf these precious missiles ever reached the earth we knew that they\nwould plunge into the atmosphere like meteors and that probably the heat\ndeveloped by their passage would melt and dissipate them in golden\nvapors before they could touch the ground.\n\nYet there was a chance that some of them--if the aim were true--might\nsurvive the fiery passage through the atmosphere and fall upon the\nsurface of our planet where, perhaps, they would afterward be picked up\nby a prospector and lead him to believe that he had struck a new\nbonanza.\n\nBut until we returned to the earth it would be impossible for us to tell\nwhat had become of the golden gifts which we had launched into space for\nour mother planet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\n_JOURNEY'S END_\n\n\n\"All aboard!\" was the signal, and the squadron having assembled under\nthe lead of the flagship, we started again for Mars.\n\nThis time, as it proved, there was to be no further interruption, and\nwhen next we paused it was in the presence of the world inhabited by our\nenemies, and facing their frowning batteries.\n\nWe did not find it so easy to start from the asteroid as it had been to\nstart from the earth; that is to say, we could not so readily generate a\nvery high velocity.\n\nIn consequence of the comparatively small size of the asteroid, its\nelectric influence was very much less than that of the earth, and\nnotwithstanding the appliances which we possessed for intensifying the\nelectrical effect, it was not possible to produce a sufficient repulsion\nto start us off for Mars with anything like the impulse which we had\nreceived from the earth on our original departure.\n\nThe utmost velocity that we could generate did not exceed three miles in\na second, and to get this required our utmost efforts. In fact, it had\nnot seemed possible that we should attain even so great a speed as that.\nIt was far more than we could have expected, and even Mr. Edison was\nsurprised, as well as greatly gratified, when he found that we were\nmoving with the velocity that I have named.\n\nWe were still about 6,000,000 miles from Mars, so that, traveling three\nmiles in a second, we should require at least twenty-three days to reach\nthe immediate neighborhood of the planet.\n\nMeanwhile we had plenty of occupation to make the time pass quickly. Our\nprisoner was transported along with us, and we now began our attempts to\nascertain what his language was, and, if possible, to master it\nourselves.\n\nBefore quitting the asteroid we had found that it was necessary for him\nto swallow one of his \"air pills,\" as Professor Moissan had called them,\nat least three times in the course of every twenty-four hours. One of us\nsupplied him regularly and I thought that I could detect evidences of a\ncertain degree of gratitude in his expression. This was encouraging,\nbecause it gave additional promise of the possibility of our being able\nto communicate with him in some more effective way than by mere signs.\nBut once inside the car, where we had a supply of air kept at the\nordinary pressure experienced on the earth, he could breathe like the\nrest of us.\n\nThe best linguists in the expedition, as Mr. Edison had suggested, were\nnow assembled in the flagship, where the prisoner was, and they set to\nwork to devise some means of ascertaining the manner in which he was\naccustomed to express his thoughts. We had not heard him speak, because\nuntil we carried him into our car there was no atmosphere capable of\nconveying any sounds he might attempt to utter.\n\nIt seemed a fair assumption that the language of the Martians would be\nscientific in its structure. We had so much evidence of the practical\nbent of their minds, and of the immense progress which they had made in\nthe direction of the scientific conquest of nature, that it was not to\nbe supposed their medium of communication with one another would be\nlacking in clearness, or would possess any of the puzzling and\nunnecessary ambiguities that characterized the languages spoken on the\nearth.\n\n\"We shall not find them making he's and she's of stones, sticks and\nother inanimate objects,\" said one of the American linguists. \"They must\ncertainly have gotten rid of all that nonsense long ago.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said a French Professor from the Sorbonne, one of the makers of\nthe never-to-be-finished dictionary. \"It will be like the language of my\ncountry. Transparent, similar to the diamond, and sparkling as is the\nfountain.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said a German enthusiast, \"that it will be a universal\nlanguage, the Volapuk of Mars, spoken by all the inhabitants of that\nplanet.\"\n\n\"But all these speculations,\" broke in Mr. Edison, \"do not help you\nmuch. Why not begin in a practical manner by finding out what the\nMartian calls himself, for instance.\"\n\nThis seemed a good suggestion, and accordingly several of the bystanders\nbegan an expressive pantomime, intended to indicate to the giant, who\nwas following all their motions with his eyes, that they wished to know\nby what name he called himself. Pointing their fingers to their own\nbreast they repeated, one after the other, the word \"man.\"\n\nIf our prisoner had been a stupid savage, of course any such attempt as\nthis to make him understand would have been idle. But it must be\nremembered that we were dealing with a personage who had presumably\ninherited from hundreds of generations the results of a civilization,\nand an intellectual advance, measured by the constant progress of\nmillions of years.\n\nAccordingly we were not very much astonished, when, after a few\nrepetitions of the experiment, the Martian--one of whose arms had been\npartially released from its bonds in order to give him a little freedom\nof motion--imitated the action of his interrogators by pressing his\nfinger over his heart.\n\nThen, opening his mouth, he gave utterance to a sound which shook the\nair of the car like the hoarse roar of a lion. He seemed himself\nsurprised by the noise he made, for he had not been used to speak in so\ndense an atmosphere.\n\nOur ears were deafened and confused, and we recoiled in astonishment,\nnot to say, half in terror.\n\nWith an ugly grin distorting his face as if he enjoyed our discomfiture,\nthe Martian repeated the motion and the sound.\n\n\"R-r-r-r-r-r-h!\"\n\nIt was not articulate to our ears and not to be represented by any\ncombination of letters.\n\n\"Faith,\" exclaimed a Dublin University professor, \"if that's what they\ncall themselves, how shall we ever translate their names when we come to\nwrite the history of the conquest?\"\n\n\"Whist, mon,\" replied a professor from the University of Aberdeen, \"let\nus whip the gillravaging villains first, and then we can describe them\nby any intitulation that may suit our deesposition.\"\n\nThe beginning of our linguistic conquest was certainly not promising, at\nleast if measured by our acquirement of words, but from another point of\nview it was very gratifying, inasmuch as it was plain that the Martian\nunderstood what we were trying to do, and was, for the present, at\nleast, disposed to aid us.\n\nThese efforts to learn the language of Mars were renewed and repeated\nevery few hours, all the experience, learning and genius of the squadron\nbeing concentrated upon the work, and the result was that in the course\nof a few days we had actually succeeded in learning a dozen or more of\nthe Martian's words and were able to make him understand us when we\npronounced them, as well as to understand him when our ears had become\naccustomed to the growling of his voice.\n\nFinally, one day the prisoner, who seemed to be in an unusually cheerful\nframe of mind, indicated that he carried in his breast some object which\nhe wished us to see.\n\nWith our assistance he pulled out a book!\n\nActually, it was a book, not very unlike the books which we have upon\nthe earth, but printed, of course, in characters that were entirely\nstrange and unknown to us. Yet these characters evidently gave\nexpression to a highly intellectual language. All those who were\nstanding by at the moment uttered a shout of wonder and of delight, and\nthe cry of \"a book! a book!\" ran around the circle, and the good news\nwas even promptly communicated to some of the neighboring electric ships\nof the squadron. Several other learned men were summoned in haste from\nthem to examine our new treasure.\n\n[Illustration: _Actually, it was a book that the prisoner produced, and\nthen he proceeded to teach us, as well as he could, several words of his\nlanguage._]\n\nThe Martian, whose good nature had manifestly been growing day after\nday, watched our inspection of his book with evidences of great\ninterest, not unmingled with amusement. Finally he beckoned the holder\nof the book to his side, and placing his broad finger upon one of the\nhuge letters--if letters they were, for they more nearly resembled the\ncharacters employed by the Chinese printer--he uttered a sound which we,\nof course, took to be a word, but which was different from any we had\nyet heard. Then he pointed to one after another of us standing around.\n\n\"Ah,\" explained everybody, the truth being apparent, \"that is the word\nby which the Martians designate us. They have a name, then, for the\ninhabitants of the earth.\"\n\n\"Or, perhaps, it is rather the name for the earth itself,\" said one.\n\nBut this could not, of course, be at once determined. Anyhow, the word,\nwhatever its precise meaning might be, had now been added to our\nvocabulary, although as yet our organs of speech proved unable to\nreproduce it in a recognizable form.\n\nThis promising and unexpected discovery of the Martian's book lent added\nenthusiasm to those who were engaged in the work of trying to master the\nlanguage of our prisoner, and the progress that they made in the course\nof the next few days was truly astonishing. If the prisoner had been\nunwilling to aid them, of course, it would have been impossible to\nproceed, but, fortunately for us, he seemed more and more to enter into\nthe spirit of the undertaking, and actually to enjoy it himself. So\nbright and quick was his understanding that he was even able to indicate\nto us methods of mastering his language that would otherwise, probably,\nnever have occurred to our minds.\n\nIn fact, in a very short time he had turned teacher and all these\nlearned men, pressing around him with eager attention, had become his\npupils.\n\nI cannot undertake to say precisely how much of the Martian language had\nbeen acquired by the chief linguists of the expedition before the time\nwhen we arrived so near to Mars that it became necessary for most of us\nto abandon our studies in order to make ready for the more serious\nbusiness which now confronted us.\n\nBut, at any rate, the acquisition was so considerable as to allow of the\ninterchange of ordinary ideas with our prisoner, and there was no longer\nany doubt that he would be able to give us much information when we\nlanded on his native planet.\n\nAt the end of twenty-three days as measured by terrestrial time, since\nour departure from the asteroid, we arrived in the sky of Mars.\n\nFor a long time the ruddy planet had been growing larger and more\nformidable, gradually turning from a huge star into a great red moon,\nand then expanding more and more until it began to shut out from sight\nthe constellations behind it. The curious markings on its surface, which\nfrom the earth can only be dimly glimpsed with a powerful telescope,\nbegan to reveal themselves clearly to our naked eyes.\n\nI have related how even before we had reached the asteroid, Mars began\nto present a most imposing appearance as we saw it with our telescopes.\nNow, however, that it was close at hand, the naked eye view of the\nplanet was more wonderful than anything we had been able to see with\ntelescopes when at a greater distance.\n\nWe were approaching the southern hemisphere of Mars in about latitude 45\ndegrees south. It was near the time of the vernal equinox in that\nhemisphere of the planet, and under the stimulating influence of the\nspring sun, rising higher and higher every day, some such awakening of\nlife and activity upon its surface as occurs on the earth under similar\ncircumstances was evidently going on.\n\nAround the South Pole were spread immense fields of snow and ice,\ngleaming with great brilliance. Cutting deep into the borders of these\nice-fields, we could see broad channels of open water, indicating the\nrapid breaking of the grip of the frost.\n\nAlmost directly beneath us was a broad oval region, light red in color,\nto which terrestrial astronomers had given the name of Hellas. Toward\nthe south, between Hellas and the borders of the polar ice, was a great\nbelt of darkness that astronomers had always been inclined to regard as\na sea. Looking toward the north, we could perceive the immense red\nexpanses of the continent of Mars, with the long curved line of the\nSyrtis Major, or \"The Hour-glass Sea,\" sweeping through the midst of\nthem toward the north until it disappeared under the horizon.\n\nCrossing and recrossing the red continent, in every direction, were the\ncanals of Schiaparelli.\n\nPlentifully sprinkled over the surface we could see brilliant points,\nsome of dazzling brightness, outshining the daylight. There was also an\nastonishing variety in the colors of the broad expanses beneath us.\nActivity, vivacity and beauty, such as we were utterly unprepared to\nbehold, expressed their presence on all sides.\n\nThe excitement on the flagship and among the other members of the\nsquadron was immense. It was certainly a thrilling scene. Here, right\nunder our feet, lay the world we had come to do battle with. Its\nappearances, while recalling in some of their broader aspects those\nwhich it had presented when viewed from our observatories, were far more\nstrange, complex and wonderful than any astronomer had ever dreamed.\nSuppose all of our anticipations about Mars should prove to have been\nwrong, after all?\n\nThere could be no longer any question that it was a world which, if not\nabsolutely teeming with inhabitants, like a gigantic ant-hill, at any\nrate bore on every side the marks of their presence and of their\nincredible undertakings and achievements.\n\nHere and there clouds of smoke arose and spread slowly through the\natmosphere beneath us. Floating higher above the surface of the planet\nwere clouds of vapor, assuming the familiar forms of stratus and cumulus\nwith which we were acquainted upon the earth.\n\nThese clouds, however, seemed upon the whole to be much less dense than\nthose to which we were accustomed at home. They had, too, a peculiar\niridescent beauty as if there was something in their composition or\ntheir texture which split up the chromatic elements of the sunlight and\nthus produced internal rainbow effects that caused some of the heavier\ncloud masses to resemble immense collections of opals, alive with the\nplay of ever-changing colors and magically suspended above the planet.\n\nAs we continued to study the phenomena that was gradually unfolded\nbeneath us we thought we could detect in many places evidences of the\nexistence of strong fortifications. The planet of war appeared to be\nprepared for the attacks of enemies. Since, as our own experience had\nshown, it sometimes waged war with distant planets, it was but natural\nthat it should be found prepared to resist foes who might be disposed to\nrevenge themselves for injuries suffered at its hands.\n\nAs had been expected, our prisoner now proved to be of very great\nassistance to us. Apparently he took a certain pride in exhibiting to\nstrangers from a distant world the beauties and wonders of his own\nplanet.\n\nWe could not understand by any means all that he said, but we could\nreadily comprehend, from his gestures, and from the manner in which his\nfeatures lighted up at the recognition of familiar scenes and objects,\nwhat his sentiments in regard to them were, and, in a general way, what\npart they played in the life of the planet.\n\nHe confirmed our opinion that certain of the works which we saw beneath\nus were fortifications, intended for the protection of the planet\nagainst invaders from outer space. A cunning and almost diabolical look\ncame into his eyes as he pointed to one of these strongholds.\n\nHis confidence and his mocking looks were not reassuring to us. He knew\nwhat his planet was capable of, and we did not. He had seen, on the\nasteroid, the extent of our power, and while its display served to\nintimidate him there, yet now that he and we together were facing the\nworld of his birth, his fear had evidently fallen from him, and he had\nthe manner of one who feels that the shield of an all-powerful protector\nhad been extended over him.\n\nBut it could not be long now before we could ascertain, by the\nirrevocable test of actual experience, whether the Martians possessed\nthe power to annihilate us or not.\n\nHow shall I describe our feelings as we gazed at the scene spread\nbeneath us? They were not quite the same as those of the discoverer of\nnew lands upon the earth. This was a whole new world that we had\ndiscovered, and it was filled, as we could see, with inhabitants.\n\nBut that was not all. We had not come with peaceful intentions.\n\nWe were to make war on this new world.\n\nDeducting our losses we had not more than 940 men left. With these we\nwere to undertake the conquest of a world containing we could not say\nhow many millions!\n\nOur enemies, instead of being below us in the scale of intelligence\nwere, we had every reason to believe, greatly our superiors. They had\nproved that they possessed a command over the powers of nature such as\nwe, up to the time when Mr. Edison made his inventions, had not even\ndreamed that it was possible for us to obtain.\n\nIt was true that at present we appeared to have the advantage, both in\nour electrical ships and in our means of offense. The disintegrator was\nat least as powerful an engine of destruction as any that the Martians\nhad yet shown that they possessed. It did not seem that in that respect\nthey could possibly excel us.\n\nDuring the brief war with the Martians upon the earth it had been\ngunpowder against a mysterious force as much stronger than gunpowder as\nthe latter was superior to the bows and arrows that preceded it.\n\nThere had been no comparison whatever between the offensive means\nemployed by the two parties in the struggle on the earth.\n\nBut the genius of one man had suddenly put us on the level of our\nenemies in regard to fighting capacity.\n\nThen, too, our electrical ships were far more effective for their\npurpose than the projectile cars used by the Martians. In fact, the\nprinciple upon which they were based was, at bottom, so simple that it\nseemed astonishing the Martians had not hit upon it.\n\nMr. Edison himself was never tired of saying in reference to this\nmatter:\n\n\"I cannot understand why the Martians did not invent these things. They\nhave given ample proof that they understand electricity better than we\ndo. Why should they have resorted to the comparatively awkward and\nbungling means of getting from one planet to another that they have\nemployed when they might have ridden through the solar system in such\nconveyances as ours with perfect ease?\"\n\n\"And besides,\" Mr. Edison would add, \"I cannot understand why they did\nnot employ the principle of harmonic vibrations in the construction of\ntheir engines of war. The lightning-like strokes which they dealt from\ntheir machines are no doubt equally powerful, but I think the range of\ndestruction covered by the disintegrators is greater.\"\n\nHowever, these questions must remain open until we could effect a\nlanding on Mars, and learn something of the condition of things there.\n\nThe thing that gave us the most uneasiness was the fact that we did not\nyet know what powers the Martians might have in reserve. It was but\nnatural to suppose that here, on their own ground, they would possess\nmeans of defense even more effective than the offensive engines they had\nemployed in attacking enemies so many millions of miles from home.\n\nIt was important that we should waste no time, and it was equally\nimportant that we should select the most vulnerable point for attack. It\nwas self-evident, therefore, that our first duty would be to reconnoiter\nthe surface of the planet and determine its weakest point of defense.\n\nAt first Mr. Edison contemplated sending the various ships in different\ndirections around the planet in order that the work of exploration might\nbe quickly accomplished. But upon second thought it seemed wiser to keep\nthe squadron together, thus diminishing the chance of disaster.\n\nBesides, the commander wished to see with his own eyes the exact\nsituation of the various parts of the planet, where it might appear\nadvisable for us to begin our assault.\n\nThus far we had remained suspended at so great a height above the planet\nthat we had hardly entered into the perceptible limits of its atmosphere\nand there was no evidence that we had been seen by the inhabitants of\nMars; but before starting on our voyage of exploration it was determined\nto drop down closer to the surface in order that we might the more\ncertainly identify the localities over which we passed.\n\nThis maneuver nearly got us into serious trouble.\n\nWhen we had arrived within a distance of three miles from the surface of\nMars we suddenly perceived approaching from the eastward a large airship\nwhich was navigating the Martian atmosphere at a height of perhaps half\na mile above the ground.\n\n[Illustration: _When we arrived within a distance of three miles\nfrom the surface of Mars we suddenly perceived approaching from the\neastward a large airship, which was navigating the Martian atmosphere at\na height of perhaps half a mile above the ground._]\n\nThis airship moved rapidly on to a point nearly beneath us, when it\nsuddenly paused, reversed its course, and evidently made signals, the\npurpose of which was not at first evident to us.\n\nBut in a short time their meaning became perfectly plain, when we found\nourselves surrounded by at least twenty similar aerostats approaching\nswiftly from different sides.\n\nIt was a great mystery to us where so many airships had been concealed\nprevious to their sudden appearance in answer to the signals.\n\nBut the mystery was quickly solved when we saw detaching itself from the\nsurface of the planet beneath us, where, while it remained immovable,\nits color had blended with that of the soil so as to render it\ninvisible, another of the mysterious ships.\n\nThen our startled eyes beheld on all sides these formidable-looking\nenemies rising from the ground beneath us like so many gigantic insects,\ndisturbed by a sudden alarm.\n\nIn a short time the atmosphere a mile or two below us, and to a distance\nof perhaps twenty miles around in every direction, was alive with\nairships of various sizes, and some of most extraordinary forms,\nexchanging signals, rushing to and fro, but all finally concentrating\nbeneath the place where our squadron was suspended.\n\nWe had poked the hornet's nest with a vengeance!\n\nAs yet there had been no sting, but we might quickly expect to feel it\nif we did not get out of range.\n\nQuickly instructions were flashed to the squadrons to rise as rapidly as\npossible to a great height.\n\nIt was evident that this maneuver would save us from danger if it were\nquickly effected, because the airships of the Martians were simply\nairships and nothing more. They could only float in the atmosphere, and\nhad no means of rising above it, or of navigating empty space.\n\nTo have turned our disintegrators upon them, and to have begun a battle\nthen and there, would have been folly.\n\nThey overwhelmingly outnumbered us, the majority of them were yet at a\nconsiderable distance and we could not have done battle, even with our\nentire squadron acting together, with more than one-quarter of them\nsimultaneously. In the meantime the others would have surrounded and\nmight have destroyed us. We must first get some idea of the planet's\nmeans of defence before we ventured to assail it.\n\nHaving risen rapidly to a height of twenty-five or thirty miles, so that\nwe could feel confident that our ships had vanished at least from the\nnaked eye view of our enemies beneath, a brief consultation was held.\n\nIt was determined to adhere to our original program and to\ncircumnavigate Mars in every direction before proceeding to open the\nwar.\n\nThe overwhelming forces shown by the enemy had intimidated even some of\nthe most courageous of our men, but still it was universally felt that\nit would not do to retreat without a blow struck.\n\nThe more we saw of the power of the Martians, the more we became\nconvinced that there would be no hope for the earth, if these enemies\never again effected a landing upon its surface, the more especially\nsince our squadron contained nearly all of the earth's force that would\nbe effective in such a contest.\n\nWith Mr. Edison and the other men of science away, they would not be\nable at home to construct such engines as we possessed, or to manage\nthem even if they were constructed.\n\nOur planet had staked everything on a single throw.\n\nThese considerations again steeled our hearts, and made us bear up as\nbravely as possible in the face of the terrible odds that confronted us.\n\nTurning the noses of our electrical ships toward the west, we began our\ncircumnavigation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\n_THE GREAT SMOKE BARRIER_\n\n\nAt first we rose to a still greater height, in order more effectually to\nescape the watchful eyes of our enemies, and then, after having moved\nrapidly several hundred miles toward the west, we dropped down again\nwithin easy eyeshot of the surface of the planet, and commenced our\ninspection.\n\nWhen we originally reached Mars, as I have related, it was at a point in\nits southern hemisphere, in latitude 45 degrees south, and longitude 75\ndegrees east, that we first closely approached its surface. Underneath\nus was the land called \"Hellas,\" and it was over this land of Hellas\nthat the Martian air fleet had suddenly made its appearance.\n\nOur westward motion, while at a great height above the planet, had\nbrought us over another oval-shaped land called \"Noachia,\" surrounded by\nthe dark ocean, the \"Mare Erytr\u00e6um.\" Now approaching nearer the surface\nour course was changed so as to carry us toward the equator of Mars.\n\nWe passed over the curious half-drowned continent known to terrestrial\nastronomers as the Region of Deucalion, then across another sea, or\ngulf, until we found ourselves floating at a height of perhaps five\nmiles, above a great continental land, at least three thousand miles\nbroad from east to west, and which I immediately recognized as that to\nwhich astronomers had given the various names of \"Aeria,\" \"Edom,\"\n\"Arabia,\" and \"Eden.\"\n\nHere the spectacle became of breathless interest.\n\n\"Wonderful! Wonderful!\"\n\n\"Who could have believed it!\"\n\nSuch were the exclamations heard on all sides.\n\nWhen at first we were suspended above Hellas, looking toward the north,\nthe northeast and the northwest, we had seen at a distance some of these\ngreat red regions, and had perceived the curious network of canals by\nwhich they were intersected. But that was a far-off and imperfect view.\n\nNow, when we were near at hand and straight above one of these singular\nlands, the magnificence of the panorama surpassed belief.\n\nFrom the earth about a dozen of the principal canals crossing the\ncontinent beneath us had been perceived, but we saw hundreds, nay\nthousands of them!\n\nIt was a double system, intended both for irrigation and for protection,\nand far more marvelous in its completeness than the boldest speculative\nminds among our astronomers had ever dared to imagine.\n\n\"Ha! that's what I always said,\" exclaimed a veteran from one of our\ngreat observatories. \"Mars is red because its soil and vegetation are\nred.\"\n\nAnd certainly appearances indicated that he was right.\n\nThere were no green trees, and there was no green grass. Both were red,\nnot of a uniform red tint, but presenting an immense variety of shades\nwhich produced a most brilliant effect, fairly dazzling our eyes.\n\nBut what trees! And what grass! And what flowers!\n\nOur telescopes showed that even the smaller trees must be 200 or 300\nfeet in height, and there were forests of giants, whose average height\nwas evidently at least 1,000 feet.\n\n\"That's all right,\" exclaimed the enthusiast I have just quoted. \"I knew\nit would be so. The trees are big for the same reason that the men are,\nbecause the planet is small, and they can grow big without becoming too\nheavy to stand.\"\n\nFlashing in the sun on all sides were the roofs of metallic buildings,\nwhich were evidently the only kind of edifices which Mars possessed. At\nany rate, if stone or wood were employed in their construction both were\ncompletely covered with metallic plates.\n\nThis added immensely to the warlike aspect of the planet. For warlike it\nwas. Everywhere we recognized fortified stations, glittering with an\narray of the polished knobs of the lightning machines, such as we had\nseen in the land of Hellas.\n\nFrom the land of Edom, directly over the equator of the planet, we\nturned our faces westward, and, skirting the Mare Erytr\u00e6um, arrived\nabove the place where the broad canal known as the Indus empties into\nthe sea.\n\nBefore us, and stretching away to the northwest, now lay the Continent\nof Chryse, a vast red land, oval in outline, and surrounded and crossed\nby innumerable canals. Chryse was not less than 1,600 miles across and\nit, too, evidently swarmed with giant inhabitants.\n\nBut the shadow of night lay upon the greater portion of the land of\nChryse. In our rapid motion westward we had outstripped the sun and had\nnow arrived at a point where day and night met upon the surface of the\nplanet beneath us.\n\nBehind all was brilliant with sunshine, but before us the face of Mars\ngradually disappeared in the deepening gloom. Through the darkness, far\naway, we could behold magnificent beams of electric light darting across\nthe curtain of night, and evidently serving to illuminate towns and\ncities that lay beneath.\n\nWe pushed on into the night for two or three hundred miles over that\npart of the continent of Chryse whose inhabitants were doubtless\nenjoying the deep sleep that accompanies the dark hours immediately\npreceding the dawn. Still everywhere splendid clusters of light lay like\nfallen constellations upon the ground, indicating the sites of great\ntowns, which, like those of the earth never sleep.\n\nBut this scene, although weird and beautiful, could give us little of\nthe kind of information of which we were in search.\n\nAccordingly it was resolved to turn back eastward until we had arrived\nin the twilight space separating day and night, and then hover over the\nplanet at that point, allowing it to turn beneath us so that, as we\nlooked down, we should see in succession the entire circuit of the globe\nof Mars while it rolled under our eyes.\n\nThe rotation of Mars on its axis is performed in a period very little\nlonger than the earth's rotation, so that the length of the day and\nnight in the world of Mars is only some forty minutes longer than their\nlength upon the earth.\n\nIn thus remaining suspended over the planet, on the line of daybreak, so\nto speak, we believed that we should be peculiarly safe from detection\nby the eyes of the inhabitants. Even astronomers are not likely to be\nwide awake just at the peep of dawn. Almost all of the inhabitants, we\nconfidently believed, would still be sound asleep upon that part of the\nplanet passing directly beneath us, and those who were awake would not\nbe likely to watch for unexpected appearances in the sky.\n\nBesides, our height was so great that notwithstanding the numbers of the\nsquadron, we could not easily be seen from the surface of the planet,\nand if seen at all we might be mistaken for high-flying birds.\n\nHere we remained then through the entire course of twenty-four hours and\nsaw in succession as they passed from night into day beneath our feet\nthe land of Chryse, the great continent of Tharsis, the curious region\nof intersecting canals which puzzled astronomers on the earth had named\nthe \"Gordian Knot.\" The continental lands of Memnonia, Amozonia and\nAeolia, the mysterious center where hundreds of vast canals came\ntogether from every direction, called the Triviun Charontis; the vast\ncircle of Elysium, a thousand miles across, and completely surrounded by\na broad green canal; the continent of Libya, which, as I remembered, had\nbeen half covered by a tremendous inundation whose effects were visible\nfrom the earth in 1889, and finally the long, dark sea of the Syrtis\nMajor, lying directly south of the land of Hellas.\n\nThe excitement and interest which we all experienced were so great that\nnot one of us took a wink of sleep during the entire twenty-four hours\nof our marvelous watch.\n\nThere are one or two things of special interest amid the multitude of\nwonderful observations that we made which I must mention here on account\nof their connection with the important events that followed soon after.\n\nJust west of the land of Chryse we saw the smaller land of Ophir, in the\nmidst of which is a singular spot called the Juventae Fons, and this\nFountain of Youth, as our astronomers, by a sort of prophetic\ninspiration, had named it, proved later to be one of the most incredible\nmarvels on the planet of Mars.\n\nFurther to the west, and north from the great continent of Tharsis, we\nbeheld the immense oval-shaped land of Thaumasia containing in its\ncenter the celebrated \"Lake of the Sun,\" a circular body of water not\nless than five hundred miles in diameter, with dozens of great canals\nrunning away from it like the spokes of a wheel in every direction, thus\nconnecting it with the ocean which surrounds it on the south and east,\nand with the still larger canals that encircle it toward the north and\nwest.\n\nThis Lake of the Sun came to play a great part in our subsequent\nadventures. It was evident to us from the beginning that it was the\nchief center of population on the planet. It lies in latitude 25 degrees\nsouth and longitude about 90 degrees west.\n\nHaving completed the circuit of the Martian globe, we were moved by the\nsame feeling which every discoverer of new lands experiences, and\nimmediately returned to our original place above the land of Hellas,\nbecause since that was the first part of Mars which we had seen, we felt\na greater degree of familiarity with it than with any portion of the\nplanet, and there, in a certain sense, we felt \"at home.\"\n\nBut, as it proved, our enemies were on the watch for us there. We had\nalmost forgotten them, so absorbed were we by the great spectacles that\nhad been unrolling themselves beneath our feet.\n\nWe ought, of course, to have been a little more cautious in approaching\nthe place where they first caught sight of us, since we might have known\nthat they would remain on the watch near that spot.\n\nBut at any rate they had seen us, and it was now too late to think of\ntaking them again by surprise.\n\nThey on their part had a surprise in store for us, which was greater\nthan any we had yet experienced.\n\nWe saw their ships assembling once more far down in the atmosphere\nbeneath us, and we thought we could detect evidences of something\nunusual going on upon the surface of the planet.\n\nSuddenly from the ships, and from various points on the ground beneath,\nthere rose high in the air, and carried by invisible currents in every\ndirection, immense volumes of black smoke, or vapor, which blotted out\nof sight everything below them!\n\nSouth, north, west and east, the curtain of blackness rapidly spread,\nuntil the whole face of the planet as far as our eyes could reach, and\nthe airships thronging under us, were all concealed from sight!\n\nMars had played the game of the cuttlefish, which when pursued by its\nenemies darkens the water behind it by a sudden outgush of inky fluid\nand thus escapes the eye of its foe.\n\nThe eyes of man had never beheld such a spectacle!\n\nWhere a few minutes before the sunny face of a beautiful and populous\nplanet had been shining beneath us, there was now to be seen nothing but\nblack, billowing clouds, swelling up everywhere like the mouse-colored\nsmoke that pours from a great transatlantic liner when fresh coal has\njust been heaped upon her fires.\n\nIn some places the smoke spouted upward in huge jets to the height of\nseveral miles; elsewhere it eddied in vast whirlpools of inky blackness.\n\nNot a glimpse of the hidden world beneath us was anywhere to be seen.\n\nMars had put on its war mask, and fearful indeed was the aspect of it!\n\nAfter the first pause of surprise the squadron quickly backed away into\nthe sky, rising rapidly, because, from one of the swirling eddies\nbeneath us the smoke began suddenly to pile itself up in an enormous\naerial mountain, whose peaks shot higher and higher, with apparently\nincreasing velocity, until they seemed about to engulf us with their\ntumbling ebon masses.\n\nUnaware what the nature of this mysterious smoke might be, and fearing\nthat it was something more than a shield for the planet, and might be\ndestructive to life, we fled before it, as before the onward sweep of a\npestilence.\n\nDirectly underneath the flagship, one of the aspiring smoke peaks grew\nwith most portentous swiftness, and, notwithstanding all our efforts, in\na little while it had enveloped us.\n\nSeveral of us were standing on the deck of the electrical ship. We were\nalmost stifled by the smoke, and were compelled to take refuge within\nthe car, where, until the electric lights had been turned on, darkness\nso black that it oppressed the strained eyeballs prevailed.\n\nBut in this brief experience, terrifying though it was, we had learned\none thing. The smoke would kill by strangulation, but evidently there\nwas nothing especially poisonous in its nature. This fact might be of\nuse to us in our subsequent proceedings.\n\n\"This spoils our plans,\" said the commander. \"There is no use of\nremaining here for the present; let us see how far this thing extends.\"\n\nAt first we rose straight away to a height of 200 or 300 miles, thus\npassing entirely beyond the sensible limits of the atmosphere, and far\nabove the highest point that the smoke could reach.\n\nFrom this commanding point of view our line of sight extended to an\nimmense distance over the surface of Mars in all directions. Everywhere\nthe same appearance; the whole planet was evidently covered with the\nsmoke.\n\nA complete telegraphic system evidently connected all the strategic\npoints upon Mars, so that, at a signal from the central station, the\nwonderful curtain could be instantaneously drawn over the entire face of\nthe planet.\n\nIn order to make certain that no part of Mars remained uncovered, we\ndropped down again nearer to the upper level of the smoke clouds, and\nthen completely circumnavigated the planet. It was thought possible that\non the night side no smoke would be found and that it would be\npracticable for us to make a descent there.\n\nBut when we had arrived on that side of Mars which was turned away from\nthe sun, we no longer saw beneath us, as we had done on our previous\nvisit to the night hemisphere of the planet, brilliant groups and\nclusters of electric lights beneath us. All was dark.\n\nIn fact, so completely did the great shell of smoke conceal the planet\nthat the place occupied by the latter seemed to be simply a vast black\nhole in the firmament.\n\nThe sun was hidden behind it, and so dense was the smoke that even the\nsolar rays were unable to penetrate it, and consequently there was no\natmospheric halo visible around the concealed planet.\n\nAll the sky around was filled with stars, but their countless host\nsuddenly disappeared when our eyes turned in the direction of Mars. The\ngreat black globe blotted them out without being visible itself.\n\n\"Apparently we can do nothing here,\" said Mr. Edison. \"Let us return to\nthe daylight side.\"\n\nWhen we had arrived near the point where we had been when the wonderful\nphenomenon first made its appearance, we paused, and then, at the\nsuggestion of one of the chemists, dropped close to the surface of the\nsmoke curtain which had now settled down into comparative quiescence, in\norder that we might examine it a little more critically.\n\nThe flagship was driven into the smoke cloud so deeply that for a minute\nwe were again enveloped in night. A quantity of the smoke was entrapped\nin a glass jar.\n\nRising again into the sunlight, the chemists began an examination of the\nconstitution of the smoke. They were unable to determine its precise\ncharacter, but they found that its density was astonishingly slight.\nThis accounted for the rapidity with which it had risen, and the great\nheight which it had attained in the comparatively light atmosphere of\nMars.\n\n\"It is evident,\" said one of the chemists, \"that this smoke does not\nextend down to the surface of the planet. From what the astronomers say\nas to the density of the air on Mars, it is probable that a clear space\nof at least a mile in height exists between the surface of Mars and the\nlower limit of the smoke curtain. Just how deep the latter is we can\nonly determine by experiment, but it would not be surprising if the\nthickness of this great blanket which Mars has thrown around itself\nshould prove to be a quarter or half a mile.\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" said one of the United States army officers, \"they have dodged\nout of sight, and I don't see why we should not dodge in and get at\nthem. If there is clear air under the smoke, as you think, why couldn't\nthe ships dart down through the curtain and come to a close tackle with\nthe Martians?\"\n\n\"It would not do at all,\" said the commander. \"We might simply run\nourselves into an ambush. No; we must stay outside, and if possible\nfight them from here.\"\n\n\"They can't keep this thing up forever,\" said the officer. \"Perhaps the\nsmoke will clear off after a while, and then we will have a chance.\"\n\n\"Not much hope of that, I am afraid,\" said the chemist who had\noriginally spoken. \"This smoke could remain floating in the atmosphere\nfor weeks, and the only wonder to me is how they ever expect to get rid\nof it, when they think their enemies have gone and they want some\nsunshine again.\"\n\n\"All that is mere speculation,\" said Mr. Edison; \"let us get at\nsomething practical. We must do one of two things; either attack them\nshielded as they are, or wait until the smoke has cleared away. The only\nother alternative, that of plunging blindly down through the curtain is\nat present not to be thought of.\"\n\n\"I am afraid we couldn't stand a very long siege ourselves,\" suddenly\nremarked the chief commissary of the expedition, who was one of the\nmembers of the flagship's company.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" asked Mr. Edison sharply, turning to him.\n\n\"Well, sir, you see,\" said the commissary, stammering, \"our provisions\nwouldn't hold out.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't hold out?\" exclaimed Mr. Edison, in astonishment, \"why we have\ncompressed and prepared provisions enough to last this squadron for\nthree years.\"\n\n\"We had, sir, when we left the earth,\" said the commissary, in apparent\ndistress, \"but I am sorry to say that something has happened.\"\n\n\"Something has happened! Explain yourself!\"\n\n\"I don't know what it is, but on inspecting some of the compressed\nstores, a short time ago, I found that a large number of them were\ndestroyed, whether through leakage of air, or what, I am unable to say.\nI sent to inquire as to the condition of the stores in the other ships\nin the squadron and I found that a similar condition of things prevailed\nthere.\n\n\"The fact is,\" continued the commissary, \"we have only provisions\nenough, in proper condition, for about ten days' consumption.\"\n\n\"After that we shall have to forage on the country, then,\" said the army\nofficer.\n\n\"Why did you not report this before?\" demanded Mr. Edison.\n\n\"Because, sir,\" was the reply, \"the discovery was not made until after\nwe arrived close to Mars, and since then there has been so much\nexcitement that I have hardly had time to make an investigation and find\nout what the precise condition of affairs is; besides, I thought we\nshould land upon the planet and then we would be able to renew our\nsupplies.\"\n\nI closely watched Mr. Edison's expression in order to see how this most\nalarming news would affect him. Although he fully comprehended its\nfearful significance, he did not lose his self-command.\n\n\"Well, well,\" he said, \"then it will become necessary for us to act\nquickly. Evidently we cannot wait for the smoke to clear off, even if\nthere was any hope of its clearing. We must get down on Mars now, having\nconquered it first if possible, but anyway we must get down there, in\norder to avoid starvation.\"\n\n\"It is very lucky,\" he continued, \"that we have ten days' supply left. A\ngreat deal can be done in ten days.\"\n\nA few hours after this the commander called me aside, and said:\n\n\"I have thought it all out. I am going to reconstruct some of our\ndisintegrators, so as to increase their range and their power. Then I am\ngoing to have some of the astronomers of the expedition locate for me\nthe most vulnerable points upon the planet, where the population is\ndensest and a hard blow would have the most effect, and I am going to\npound away at them, through the smoke, and see whether we cannot draw\nthem out of their shell.\"\n\nWith his expert assistants Mr. Edison set to work at once to transform a\nnumber of the disintegrators into still more formidable engines of the\nsame description. One of these new weapons having been distributed to\neach of the members of the squadron, the next problem was to decide\nwhere to strike.\n\nWhen we first examined the surface of the planet it will be remembered\nthat we had regarded the Lake of the Sun and its environs as being the\nvery focus of the planet. While it might also be a strong point of\ndefence, yet an effective blow struck there would go to the enemy's\nheart and be more likely to bring the Martians promptly to terms than\nanything else.\n\nThe first thing, then, was to locate the Lake of the Sun on the smoke\nhidden surface of the planet beneath us. This was a problem that the\nastronomers could readily solve.\n\nFortunately, in the flagship itself there was one of the star-gazing\ngentlemen who had made a specialty of the study of Mars. That planet, as\nI have already explained, was now in opposition to the earth. The\nastronomer had records in his pocket which enabled him, by a brief\ncalculation, to say just when the Lakes of the Sun would be on the\nmeridian of Mars as seen from the earth. Our chronometers still kept\nterrestrial time; we knew the exact number of days and hours that had\nelapsed since we had departed, and so it was possible by placing\nourselves in a line between the earth and Mars to be practically in the\nsituation of an astronomer in his observatory at home.\n\nThen it was only necessary to wait for the hour when the Lake of the Sun\nwould be upon the meridian of Mars in order to be certain what was the\ntrue direction of the latter from the flagship.\n\nHaving thus located the heart of our foe behind its shield of darkness,\nwe prepared to strike.\n\n\"I have ascertained,\" said Mr. Edison, \"the vibration period of the\nsmoke, so that it will be easy for us to shatter it into invisible\natoms. You will see that every stroke of the disintegrators will open a\nhole through the black curtain. If their field of destruction could be\nmade wide enough, we might in that manner clear away the entire covering\nof smoke, but all that we shall really be able to do will be to puncture\nit with holes, which will, perhaps, enable us to catch glimpses of the\nsurface beneath. In that manner we may be able more effectually to\nconcentrate our fire upon the most vulnerable points.\"\n\nEverything being prepared, and the entire squadron having assembled to\nwatch the effect of the opening blow and be ready to follow it up, Mr.\nEdison himself poised one of the new disintegrators, which was too large\nto be carried in the hand, and, following the direction indicated by the\ncalculations of the astronomers, launched the vibratory discharge into\nthe ocean of blackness beneath.\n\nInstantly there opened beneath us a huge well-shaped hole from which the\nblack clouds rolled violently back in every direction.\n\nThrough this opening we saw the gleam of brilliant lights beneath.\n\nWe had made a hit.\n\n\"It's the Lake of the Sun!\" shouted the astronomer who furnished the\ncalculation by means of which its position had been discovered.\n\nAnd, indeed, it was the Lake of the Sun. While the opening in the clouds\nmade by the discharge was not wide, yet it sufficed to give us a view of\na portion of the curving shore of the lake, which was ablaze with\nelectric lights.\n\nWhether our shot had done any damage, beyond making the circular opening\nin the cloud curtain, we could not tell, for almost immediately the\nsurrounding black smoke masses billowed in to fill up the hole.\n\nBut in the brief glimpse we had caught sight of two or three large\nairships hovering in space above that part of the Lake of the Sun and\nits bordering city which we had beheld. It seemed to me in the brief\nglance I had that one ship had been touched by the discharge and was\nwandering in an erratic manner. But the clouds closed in so rapidly that\nI could not be certain.\n\nAnyhow, we had demonstrated one thing, and that was that we could\npenetrate the cloud shield and reach the Martians in their hiding place.\n\nIt had been prearranged that the first discharge from the flagship\nshould be a signal for the concentration of the fire of all the other\nships upon the same spot.\n\nA little hesitation, however, occurred, and a half a minute had elapsed\nbefore the disintegrators from the other members of the squadron were\ngot into play.\n\nThen, suddenly we saw an immense commotion in the cloud beneath us. It\nseemed to be beaten and hurried in every direction and punctured like a\nsieve with nearly a hundred great circular holes. Through these gaps we\ncould see clearly a large region of the planet's surface, with many\nairships floating above it and the blaze of innumerable electric lights\nilluminating it. The Martians had created an artificial day under the\ncurtain.\n\nThis time there was no question that the blow had been effective. Four\nor five of the airships, partially destroyed, tumbled headlong toward\nthe ground, while even from our great distance there was unmistakable\nevidence that fearful execution had been done among the crowded\nstructures along the shore of the lake.\n\nAs each of our ships possessed but one of the new disintegrators, and\nsince a minute or so was required to adjust them for a fresh discharge,\nwe remained for a little while inactive after delivering the blow.\nMeanwhile the cloud curtain, though rent to shreds by the concentrated\ndischarge of the disintegrators, quickly became a uniform black sheet\nagain, hiding everything.\n\nWe had just had time to congratulate ourselves on the successful opening\nof our bombardment, and the disintegrator of the flagship was poised for\nanother discharge, when suddenly out of the black expanse beneath,\nquivered immense electric beams, clear cut and straight as bars of\nsteel, but dazzling our eyes with unendurable brilliance.\n\nIt was the reply of the Martians to our attack.\n\nThree or four of the electrical ships were seriously damaged, and one,\nclose beside the flagship, changed color, withered and collapsed, with\nthe same sickening phenomena that had made our hearts shudder when the\nfirst disaster of this kind occurred during our brief battle over the\nasteroid.\n\nAnother score of our comrades were gone, and yet we had hardly begun the\nfight.\n\nGlancing at the other ships which had been injured, I saw that the\ndamage to them was not so serious, although they were evidently _hors de\ncombat_ for the present.\n\nOur fighting blood was now boiling and we did not stop long to count our\nlosses.\n\n\"Into the smoke!\" was the signal, and the ninety and more electric ships\nwhich still remained in condition for action immediately shot downward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\n\n_THE EARTH GIRL_\n\n\nIt was a wild plunge. We kept off the decks while rushing through the\nblinding smoke, but the instant we emerged below, where we found\nourselves still a mile above the ground, we were out again, ready to\nstrike.\n\nI have simply a confused recollection of flashing lights beneath, and a\ngreat, dark arch of clouds above, out of which our ships seemed dropping\non all sides, and then the fray burst on and around us, and no man could\nsee or notice anything except by half-comprehended glances.\n\nAlmost in an instant, it seemed, a swarm of airships surrounded us,\nwhile from what, for lack of a more descriptive name, I shall call the\nforts about the Lake of the Sun, leaped tongues of electric fire, before\nwhich some of our ships, were driven like bits of flaming paper in a\nhigh wind, gleaming for a moment, then curling up and gone forever!\n\nIt was an awful sight; but the battle fever was raging within us, and\nwe, on our part, were not idle.\n\nEvery man carried a disintegrator, and these hand instruments, together\nwith those of heavier caliber on the ship poured their resistless\nvibrations in every direction through the quivering air.\n\nThe airships of the Martians were destroyed by the score, and yet they\nflocked upon us thicker and faster.\n\nWe dropped lower and our blows fell upon the forts, and upon the wide\nspread city bordering the Lake of the Sun. We almost entirely silenced\nthe fire of one of the forts; but there were forty more in full action\nwithin reach of our eyes!\n\nSome of the metallic buildings were partly unroofed by the\ndisintegrators and some had their walls riddled and fell with thundering\ncrashes, whose sound rose to our ears above the hellish din of battle. I\ncaught glimpses of giant forms struggling in the ruins and rushing\nwildly through the streets, but there was no time to see anything\nclearly.\n\nOur flagship seemed charmed. A crowd of airships hung upon it like a\nswarm of angry bees, and, at times, one could not see for the lightning\nstrokes--yet we escaped destruction, while ourselves dealing death on\nevery hand.\n\nIt was a glorious fight, but it was not war; no, it was not war. We\nreally had no more chance of ultimate success amid that multitude of\nenemies than a prisoner running the gauntlet in a crowd of savages has\nof escape.\n\nA conviction of the hopelessness of the contest finally forced itself\nupon our minds, and the shattered squadron, which had kept well together\namid the storm of death, was signalled to retreat.\n\nShaking off their pursuers, as a hunted bear shakes off the dogs, sixty\nof the electrical ships rose up through the clouds where more than\nninety had gone down!\n\nMadly we rushed upward through the vast curtain and continued our flight\nto a great elevation, far beyond the reach of the awful artillery of the\nenemy.\n\nLooking back it seemed the very mouth of hell from which we had escaped.\n\nThe Martians did not for an instant cease their fire, even when we were\nfar beyond their reach. With furious persistence they blazed away\nthrough the cloud curtain, and the vivid spikes of lightning shuddered\nso swiftly on one another's track that they were like a flaming halo of\nelectric lances around the frowning helmet of the War Planet.\n\nBut after a while they stopped their terrific sparring, and once more\nthe immense globe assumed the appearance of a vast ball of black smoke\nstill widely agitated by the recent disturbance, but exhibiting no\nopening through which we could discern what was going on beneath.\n\nEvidently the Martians believed they had finished us.\n\nAt no time since the beginning of our adventure had it appeared to me\nquite so hopeless, reckless and mad as it seemed at present.\n\nWe had suffered fearful losses, and yet what had we accomplished? We had\nwon two fights on the asteroid, it is true, but then we had overwhelming\nnumbers on our side.\n\nNow we were facing millions on their own ground, and our very first\nassault had resulted in a disastrous repulse, with the loss of at least\nthirty electric ships and 600 men!\n\nEvidently we could not endure this sort of thing. We must find some\nother means of assailing Mars or else give up the attempt.\n\nBut the latter was not to be thought. It was no mere question of\nself-pride, however, and no consideration of the tremendous interests at\nstake, which would compel us to continue our apparently vain attempt.\n\nOur provisions could last only a few days longer. The supply would not\ncarry us one-quarter of the way back to earth, and we must therefore\nremain here and literally conquer or die.\n\nIn this extremity a consultation of the principal officers was called\nupon the deck of the flagship.\n\nHere the suggestion was made that we should attempt to effect by\nstrategy what we had failed to do by force.\n\nAn old army officer who had served in many wars against the cunning\nIndians of the West, Colonel Alonzo Jefferson Smith, was the author of\nthis suggestion.\n\n\"Let us circumvent them,\" he said. \"We can do it in this way. The\nchances are that all of the available fighting force of the planet Mars\nis now concentrated on this side and in the neighborhood of The Lake of\nthe Sun.\n\n\"Possibly, by some kind of X-ray business, they can only see us dimly\nthrough the clouds, and if we get a little further away they will not be\nable to see us at all.\n\n\"Now, I suggest that a certain number of the electrical ships be\nwithdrawn from the squadron to a great distance, while the remainder\nstay here; or, better still, approach to a point just beyond the reach\nof those streaks of lightning, and begin a bombardment of the clouds\nwithout paying any attention to whether the strokes reach through the\nclouds and do any damage or not.\n\n\"This will induce the Martians to believe that we are determined to\npress our attack at this point.\n\n\"In the meantime, while these ships are raising a hulabaloo on this side\nof the planet, and drawing their fire, as much as possible, without\nrunning into any actual danger, let the others which have been selected\nfor the purpose, sail rapidly around to the other side of Mars and take\nthem in the rear.\"\n\nIt was not perfectly clear what Colonel Smith intended to do after the\nlanding had been effected in the rear of the Martians, but still there\nseemed a good deal to be said for his suggestion, and it would, at any\nrate, if carried out, enable us to learn something about the condition\nof things on the planet, and perhaps furnish us with a hint as to how we\ncould best proceed in the further prosecution of the siege.\n\nAccordingly it was resolved that about twenty ships should be told off\nfor this movement, and Colonel Smith himself was placed in command.\n\nAt my desire I accompanied the new commander in his flagship.\n\nRising to a considerable elevation in order that there might be no risk\nof being seen, we began our flank movement while the remaining ships, in\naccordance with the understanding, dropped nearer the curtain of cloud\nand commenced a bombardment with the disintegrators, which caused a\ntremendous commotion in the clouds, opening vast gaps in them, and\noccasionally revealing a glimpse of the electric lights on the planet,\nalthough it was evident that the vibratory currents did not reach the\nground. The Martians immediately replied to this renewed attack, and\nagain the cloud covered globe bristled with lightning, which flashed so\nfiercely out of the blackness below that the stoutest hearts among us\nquailed, although we were situated well beyond the danger.\n\nBut this sublime spectacle rapidly vanished from our eyes when, having\nattained a proper elevation, we began our course toward the opposite\nhemisphere of the planet.\n\nWe guided our flight by the stars, and from our knowledge of the\nrotation period of Mars, and the position which the principal points on\nits surface must occupy at certain hours, we were able to tell what part\nof the planet lay beneath us.\n\nHaving completed our semi-circuit we found ourselves on the night side\nof Mars, and determined to lose no time in executing our coup. But it\nwas deemed best that an exploration should first be made by a single\nelectrical ship, and Colonel Smith naturally wished to undertake the\nadventure with his own vessel.\n\nWe dropped rapidly through the black cloud curtain, which proved to be\nat least half a mile in thickness, and then suddenly emerged, as if\nsuspended at the apex of an enormous dome, arching above the surface of\nthe planet a mile beneath us, which sparkled on all sides with\ninnumerable lights.\n\nThese lights were so numerous and so brilliant as to produce a faint\nimitation of daylight, even at our immense height above the ground, and\nthe dome of cloud out of which we had emerged assumed a soft fawn color\nwhich produced an indescribably beautiful effect.\n\nFor a moment we recoiled from our undertaking, and arrested the motion\nof the electric ship.\n\nBut on closely examining the surface beneath us we found that there was\na broad region, where comparatively few bright lights were to be seen.\nFrom my knowledge of the geography of Mars I knew that this was a part\nof the Land of Ausonia, situated a few hundred miles northeast of\nHellas, where we had first seen the planet.\n\nEvidently it was not so thickly populated as some of the other parts of\nMars, and its comparative darkness was an attraction to us. We\ndetermined to approach within a few hundred feet of the ground with the\nelectric ship, and then, in case no enemies appeared, to visit the soil\nitself.\n\n\"Perhaps we shall see or hear something that will be of use to us,\" said\nColonel Smith, \"and for the purposes of this first reconnaissance it is\nbetter that we should be few in number. The other ships will await our\nreturn, and at any rate we shall not be gone long.\"\n\nAs our car approached the ground we found ourselves near the tops of\nsome lofty trees.\n\n\"This will do,\" said Colonel Smith to the electrical steersman, \"Stay\nright here.\"\n\nHe and I then lowered ourselves into the branches of the trees, each\ncarrying a small disintegrator, and cautiously clambered down to the\nground.\n\nWe believed we were the first of the descendants of Adam to set foot on\nthe planet of Mars.\n\nAt first we suffered somewhat from the effects of the rare atmosphere.\nIt was so lacking in density that it resembled the air on the summits of\nthe loftiest terrestrial mountains.\n\nHaving reached the foot of the tree in safety, we lay down for a moment\non the ground to recover ourselves and to become accustomed to our new\nsurroundings.\n\nA thrill, born half of wonder, half of incredulity, ran through me at\nthe touch of the soil of Mars. Here was I, actually on that planet,\nwhich had seemed so far away, so inaccessible, and so full of mysteries\nwhen viewed from the earth. And yet, surrounding me, were\nthings--gigantic, it is true--but still resembling and recalling the\nfamiliar sights of my own world.\n\nAfter a little while our lungs became accustomed to the rarity of the\natmosphere and we experienced a certain stimulation in breathing.\n\nWe then got upon our feet and stepped out from under the shadow of the\ngigantic tree. High above we could faintly see our electrical ship,\ngently swaying in the air close to the tree top.\n\nThere were no electric lights in our immediate neighborhood, but we\nnoticed that the whole surface of the planet around us was gleaming with\nthem, producing an effect like the glow of a great city seen from a\ndistance at night. The glare was faintly reflected from the vast dome of\nclouds above, producing the general impression of a moonlight night upon\nthe earth.\n\nIt was a wonderfully quiet and beautiful spot where we had come down.\nThe air had a delicate feel and a bracing temperature, while a soft\nbreeze soughed through the leaves of the tree above our heads.\n\nNot far away was the bank of a canal, bordered by a magnificent avenue\nshaded by a double row of immense umbrageous trees.\n\nWe approached the canal, and, getting upon the road, turned to the left\nto make an exploration in that direction. The shadow of the trees\nfalling upon the roadway produced a dense gloom, in the midst of which\nwe felt that we should be safe, unless the Martians had eyes like those\nof cats.\n\nAs we pushed along, our hearts, I confess, beating a little quickly, a\nshadow stirred in front of us.\n\nSomething darker than the night itself approached.\n\nAs it drew near it assumed the appearance of an enormous dog, as tall as\nan ox, which ran swiftly our way with a threatening motion of its head.\nBut before it could even utter a snarl, the whirr of Colonel Smith's\ndisintegrator was heard and the creature vanished in the shadow.\n\n\"Gracious, did you ever see such a beast?\" said the Colonel. \"Why he was\nas big as a grizzly.\"\n\n\"The people he belonged to must be near by,\" I said. \"Very likely he was\na watch on guard.\"\n\n\"But I see no signs of a habitation.\"\n\n\"True, but you observe there is a thick hedge on the side of the road\nopposite the canal. If we get through that perhaps we shall catch sight\nof something.\"\n\nCautiously we pushed our way through the hedge, which was composed of\nshrubs as large as small trees, and very thick at the bottom, and,\nhaving traversed it, found ourselves in a great meadow-like expanse\nwhich might have been a lawn. At a considerable distance, in the midst\nof a clump of trees, a large building towered skyward, its walls of some\nred metal, gleaming like polished copper in the soft light that fell\nfrom the cloud dome.\n\nThere were no lights around the building itself, and we saw nothing\ncorresponding to windows on that side which faced us, but toward the\nright a door was evidently open, and out of this streamed a brilliant\nshaft of illumination, which lay bright upon the lawn, then crossed the\nhighway through an opening in the hedge, and gleamed on the water of the\ncanal beyond.\n\nWhere we stood the ground had evidently been recently cleared, and there\nwas no obstruction, but as we crept closer to the house--for our\ncuriosity had now become irresistible--we found ourselves crawling\nthrough grass so tall that if we had stood erect it would have risen\nwell above our heads.\n\n\"This affords good protection,\" said Colonel Smith, recalling his\nadventures on the western plains. \"We can get close in to the Indians--I\nbeg pardon, I mean the Martians--without being seen.\"\n\nHeavens, what an adventure was this! To be crawling about in the night\non the face of another world and venturing, perhaps, into the jaws of a\ndanger which human experience could not measure!\n\nBut on we went, and in a little while we had emerged from the tall grass\nand were somewhat startled by the discovery that we had got close to the\nwall of the building.\n\nCarefully we crept around to the open door.\n\nAs we neared it we suddenly stopped as if we had been stricken with\ninstantaneous paralysis.\n\nOut of the door floated, on the soft night air, the sweetest music to\nwhich I have ever listened.\n\nIt carried me back in an instant to my own world. It was the music of\nthe earth. It was the melodious expression of a human soul. It thrilled\nus both to the heart's core.\n\n\"My God!\" exclaimed Colonel Smith. \"What can that be? Are we dreaming,\nor where in heaven's name are we?\"\n\nStill the enchanting harmony floated out upon the air.\n\nWhat the instrument was I could not tell, but the sound seemed more\nnearly to resemble that of a violin than anything else of which I could\nthink.\n\nWhen we first heard it the strains were gentle, sweet, caressing and\nfull of an infinite depth of feeling, but in a little while its tone\nchanged, and it became a magnificent march, throbbing upon the air in\nstirring notes that set our hearts beating in unison with its stride and\ninspiring in us a courage that we had not felt before.\n\nThen it drifted into a wild fantasia, still inexpressibly sweet, and\nfrom that changed again into a requiem or lament, whose mellifluous tide\nof harmony swept our thoughts back again to the earth.\n\n\"I can endure this no longer,\" I said. \"I must see who it is that makes\nthat music. It is the product of a human heart and must come from the\ntouch of human fingers.\"\n\nWe carefully shifted our position until we stood in the blaze of light\nthat poured out of the door.\n\nThe doorway was an immense arched opening, magnificently ornamented,\nrising to a height of, I should say, not less than twenty or twenty-five\nfeet and broad in proportion. The door itself stood widely open and it,\ntogether with all of its fittings and surroundings, was composed of the\nsame beautiful red metal.\n\nStepping out a little way into the light I could see within the door an\nimmense apartment, glittering on all sides with metallic ornaments and\ngems and lighted from the center by a great chandelier of electric\ncandles.\n\nIn the middle of the great floor, holding the instrument delicately\npoised, and still awaking its ravishing voice, stood a figure, the sight\nof which almost stopped my breath.\n\nIt was a slender sylph of a girl!\n\nA girl of my own race; a human being here upon the planet Mars!\n\n[Illustration: _\"In the middle of the great floor, holding the instrument\ndelicately poised, and still awaking its ravishing voice, stood a\nfigure, the sight of which almost stopped my breath! It was a slender\nsylph of a girl! A girl of my own race; a human being here on Mars!\"_]\n\nHer hair was loosely coiled and she was attired in graceful white\ndrapery.\n\n\"By God!\" cried Colonel Smith, \"she's human!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE\n\n_RETREAT TO DEIMOS_\n\n\nStill the Bewildering Strains of the music came to our ears, and yet we\nstood there unperceived, though in the full glare of the chandelier.\n\nThe girl's face was presented in profile. It was exquisite in beauty,\npale, delicate with a certain pleading sadness which stirred us to the\nheart.\n\nAn element of romance and a touch of personal interest such as we had\nnot looked for suddenly entered into our adventure.\n\nColonel Smith's mind still ran back to the perils of the plains.\n\n\"She is a prisoner,\" he said, \"and by the Seven Devils of Dona Ana we'll\nnot leave her here. But where are the hellhounds themselves?\"\n\nOur attention had been so absorbed by the sight of the girl that we had\nscarcely thought of looking to see if there was any one else in the\nroom.\n\nGlancing beyond her, I now perceived sitting in richly decorated chairs\nthree or four gigantic Martians. They were listening to the music as if\ncharmed.\n\nThe whole story told itself. This girl, if not their slave, was at any\nrate under their control, and she was furnishing entertainment for them\nby her musical skill. The fact that they could find pleasure in music so\nbeautiful was, perhaps, an indication that they were not really as\nsavage as they seemed.\n\nYet our hearts went out to the girl, and were turned against them with\nan uncontrollable hatred.\n\nThey were of the same remorseless race with those who had so lately lain\nwaste our fair earth and who would have completed its destruction had\nnot Providence interferred in our behalf.\n\nSingularly enough, although we stood full in the light, they had not yet\nseen us.\n\nSuddenly the girl, moved by what impulse I know not, turned her face in\nour direction. Her eyes fell upon us. She paused abruptly in her\nplaying, and her instrument dropped to the floor. Then she uttered a\ncry, and with extended arms ran toward us.\n\nBut when she was near she stopped abruptly, the glad look fading from\nher face, and started back with terror-stricken eyes, as if, after all,\nshe had found us not what she expected.\n\nThen for an instant she looked more intently at us, her countenance\ncleared once more, and, overcome by some strange emotion, her eyes\nfilled with tears, and, drawing a little nearer, she stretched forth her\nhands to us appealingly.\n\nMeanwhile the Martians had started to their feet. They looked down upon\nus in astonishment. We were like pygmies to them; like little gnomes\nwhich had sprung out of the ground at their feet.\n\nOne of the giants seized some kind of a weapon and started forward with\na threatening gesture.\n\nThe girl sprang to my side and grasped my arm with a cry of fear.\n\nThis seemed to throw the Martian into a sudden frenzy, and he raised his\narms to strike.\n\nBut the disintegrator was in my hand.\n\nMy rage was equal to his.\n\nI felt the concentrated vengeance of the earth quivering through me as I\npressed the button of the disintegrator and, sweeping it rapidly up and\ndown, saw the gigantic form that confronted me melt into nothingness.\n\nThere were three other giants in the room, and they had been on the\npoint of following up the attack of their comrade. But when he\ndisappeared from before their eyes, they paused, staring in amazement at\nthe place where, but a moment before, he had stood, but where now only\nthe metal weapon he had wielded lay on the floor.\n\nAt first they started back, and seemed on the point of fleeing; then,\nwith a second glance, perceiving again how small and insignificant we\nwere, all three together advanced upon us.\n\nThe girl sank trembling on her knees.\n\nIn the meantime I had readjusted my disintegrator for another discharge,\nand Colonel Smith stood by me with the light of battle upon his face.\n\n\"Sweep the discharge across the three,\" I exclaimed. \"Otherwise there\nwill be one left and before we can fire again he will crush us.\"\n\nThe whirr of the two instruments sounded simultaneously, and with a\nquick horizontal motion we swept the lines of force around in such a\nmanner that all three of the Martians were caught by the vibratory\nstreams and actually cut in two.\n\nLong gaps were opened in the wall of the room behind them, where the\ndestroying currents had passed, for with wrathful fierceness, we had ran\nthe vibrations through half a gamut on the index.\n\nThe victory was ours. There were no other enemies, that we could see, in\nthe house.\n\nYet at any moment others might make their appearance, and what more we\ndid must be done quickly.\n\nThe girl evidently was as much amazed as the Martians had been by the\neffects which we had produced. Still she was not terrified, and\ncontinued to cling to us and glance beseechingly into our faces,\nexpressing in her every look and gesture the fact that she knew we were\nof her own race.\n\nBut clearly she could not speak our tongue, for the words she uttered\nwere unintelligible.\n\nColonel Smith, whose long experience in Indian warfare had made him\nintensely practical, did not lose his military instincts, even in the\nmidst of events so strange.\n\n\"It occurs to me,\" he said, \"that we have got a chance at the enemies'\nsupplies. Suppose we begin foraging right here. Let's see if this girl\ncan't show us the commissary department.\"\n\nHe immediately began to make signs to the girl to indicate that he was\nhungry.\n\nA look of comprehension flitted over her features, and, seizing our\nhands, she led us into an adjoining apartment, and pointed to a number\nof metallic boxes.\n\nOne of these she opened, taking out of it a kind of cake, which she\nplaced between her teeth, breaking off a very small portion and then\nhanding it to us, motioning that we should eat, but at the same time\nshowing us that we ought to take only a small quantity.\n\n\"Thank God! It's compressed food,\" said Colonel Smith. \"I thought these\nMartians with their wonderful civilization would be up to that. And it's\nmighty lucky for us, because, without overburdening ourselves, if we can\nfind one or two more caches like this we shall be able to reprovision\nthe entire fleet. But we must get reinforcements before we can take\npossession of the fodder.\"\n\nAccordingly we hurried out into the night, passed into the roadway, and,\ntaking the girl with us, ran as rapidly as possible to the foot of the\ntree where we had made our descent. Then we signalled to the electric\nship to drop down to the level of the ground.\n\nThis was quickly done, the girl was taken aboard, and a dozen men, under\nour guidance, hastened back to the house, where we loaded ourselves with\nthe compressed provisions and conveyed them to the ship.\n\nOn this second trip to the mysterious house we had discovered another\napartment containing a very large number of the metallic boxes, filled\nwith compressed food.\n\n\"By Jove, it is a storehouse,\" said Colonel Smith. \"We must get more\nforce and carry it all off. Gracious, but this is a lucky night. We can\nreprovision the whole fleet from this room.\"\n\n\"I thought it singular,\" I said, \"that with the exception of the girl\nwhom we have rescued no women were seen in the house. Evidently the\nlights over yonder indicate the location of a considerable town, and it\nis quite probable that this building, without windows, and so strongly\nconstructed, is the common storehouse, where the provisions for the town\nare kept. The fellows we killed must have been the watchmen in charge of\nthe storehouse, and they were treating themselves to a little music from\nthe slave girl when we happened to come upon them.\"\n\nWith the utmost haste several of the other electrical ships, waiting\nabove the cloud curtain, were summoned to descend, and, with more than a\nhundred men, we returned to the building, and this time almost entirely\nexhausted its stores, each man carrying as much as he could stagger\nunder.\n\nFortunately our proceedings had been conducted without much noise, and\nthe storehouse being situated at a considerable distance from other\nbuildings, none of the Martians, except those who would never tell the\nstory, had known of our arrival or of our doings on the planet.\n\n\"Now, we'll return and surprise Edison with the news,\" said Colonel\nSmith.\n\nOur ship was the last to pass up through the clouds, and it was a\nstrange sight to watch the others as one after another they rose toward\nthe great dome, entered it, though from below it resembled a solid vault\nof grayish-pink marble, and disappeared.\n\nWe quickly followed them, and having penetrated the enormous curtain,\nwere considerably surprised on emerging at the other side to find that\nthe sun was shining brilliantly upon us. It will be remembered that it\nwas night on this side of Mars when we went down, but our adventure had\noccupied several hours, and now Mars had so turned upon its axis that\nthe portion of its surface over which we were had come around into the\nsunlight.\n\nWe knew that the squadron which we had left besieging the Lake of the\nSun must also have been carried around in a similar manner, passing into\nthe night while the side of the planet where we were was emerging into\nday.\n\nOur shortest way back would be by traveling westward, because then we\nshould be moving in a direction opposite to that in which the planet\nrotated, and the main squadron, sharing that rotation, would be\ncontinually moving in our direction.\n\nBut to travel westward was to penetrate once more into the night side of\nthe planet.\n\nThe prows, if I may so call them, of our ships were accordingly turned\nin the direction of the vast shadow which Mars was invisibly projecting\ninto space behind it, and on entering that shadow the sun disappeared\nfrom our eyes, and once more the huge hidden globe beneath us became a\nblack chasm among the stars.\n\nNow that we were in the neighborhood of a globe capable of imparting\nconsiderable weight to all things under the influence of its attraction\nthat peculiar condition which I have before described as existing in the\nmidst of space, where there was neither up nor down for us, had ceased.\nHere where we had weight \"up\" and \"down\" had resumed their old meanings.\n\"Down\" was toward the center of Mars, and \"up\" was away from that\ncenter.\n\nStanding on the deck, and looking overhead as we swiftly ploughed our\nsmooth way at a great height through the now imperceptible atmosphere of\nthe planet, I saw the two moons of Mars meeting in the sky exactly above\nus.\n\nBefore our arrival at Mars, there had been considerable discussion among\nthe learned men as to the advisability of touching at one of their\nmoons, and when the discovery was made that our provisions were nearly\nexhausted, it had been suggested that the Martian satellites might\nfurnish us with an additional supply.\n\nBut it had appeared a sufficient reply to this suggestion that the moons\nof Mars are both insignificant bodies, not much larger than the asteroid\nwe had fallen in with, and that there could not possibly be any form of\nvegetation or other edible products upon them.\n\nThis view having prevailed, we had ceased to take an interest in the\nsatellites, further than to regard them as objects of great curiosity on\naccount of their motions.\n\nThe nearer of these moons, Phobos, is only 3,700 miles from the surface\nof Mars, and we watched it traveling around the planet three times in\nthe course of every day. The more distant one, Deimos, 12,500 miles\naway, required considerably more than one day to make its circuit.\n\nIt now happened that the two had come into conjunction, as I have said,\njust over our heads, and, throwing myself down on my back on the deck of\nthe electrical ship, for a long time I watched the race between the two\nsatellites, until Phobos, rapidly gaining upon the other, had left its\nrival far behind.\n\nSuddenly Colonel Smith, who took very little interest in these\nastronomical curiosities, touched me, and pointing ahead, said:\n\n\"There they are.\"\n\nI looked, and sure enough there were the signal lights of the principal\nsquadron, and as we gazed we occasionally saw, darting up from the vast\ncloud mass beneath, an electric bayonet, fiercely thrust into the sky,\nwhich showed that the siege was still actively going on, and that the\nMartians were jabbing away at their invisible enemies outside the\ncurtain.\n\nIn a short time the two fleets had joined, and Colonel Smith and I\nimmediately transferred ourselves to the flagship.\n\n\"Well, what have you done?\" asked Mr. Edison, while others crowded\naround with eager attention.\n\n\"If we have not captured their provision train,\" said Colonel Smith, \"we\nhave done something just about as good. We have foraged on the country,\nand have collected a supply that I reckon will last this fleet for at\nleast a month.\"\n\n\"What's that? What's that?\"\n\n\"It's just what I say,\" and Colonel Smith brought out of his pocket one\nof the square cakes of compressed food. \"Set your teeth in that, and see\nwhat you think of it, but don't take too much, for its powerful strong.\"\n\n\"I say,\" he continued, \"we have got enough of that stuff to last us all\nfor a month, but we've done more than that; we have got a surprise for\nyou that will make you open your eyes. Just wait a minute.\"\n\nColonel Smith made a signal to the electrical ship which we had just\nquitted to draw near. It came alongside, so that one could step from its\ndeck onto the flagship. Colonel Smith disappeared for a minute in the\ninterior of his ship, then re-emerged, leading the girl whom we had\nfound upon the planet.\n\n\"Take her inside, quick,\" he said, \"for she is not used to this thin\nair.\"\n\nIn fact, we were at so great an elevation that the rarity of the\natmosphere now compelled us all to wear our air-tight suits, and the\ngirl, not being thus attired, would have fallen unconscious on the deck\nif we had not instantly removed her to the interior of the car.\n\nThere she quickly recovered from the effects of the deprivation of air\nand looked about her, pale, astonished, but yet apparently without fear.\n\nEvery motion of this girl convinced me that she not only recognized us\nas members of her own race, but that she felt that her only hope lay in\nour aid. Therefore, strange as we were to her in many respects,\nnevertheless she did not think that she was in danger while among us.\n\nThe circumstances under which we had found her were quickly explained.\nHer beauty, her strange fate and the impenetrable mystery which\nsurrounded her excited universal admiration and wonder.\n\n\"How did she get on Mars?\" was the question that everybody asked, and\nthat nobody could answer.\n\nBut while all were crowding around and overwhelming the poor girl with\ntheir staring, suddenly she burst into tears, and then, with arms\noutstretched in the same appealing manner which had so stirred our\nsympathies when we first saw her in the house of the Martians, she broke\nforth in a wild recitation, which was half a song and half a wail.\n\nAs she went on I noticed that a learned professor of languages from the\nUniversity of Heidelberg was listening to her with intense attention.\nSeveral times he appeared to be on the point of breaking in with an\nexclamation. I could plainly see that he was becoming more and more\nexcited as the words poured from the girl's lips. Occasionally he nodded\nand muttered, smiling to himself.\n\nHer song finished, the girl sank half-exhausted upon the floor. She was\nlifted and placed in a reclining position at the side of the car.\n\nThen the Heidelberg professor stepped to the center of the car, in the\nsight of all, and in a most impressive manner said:\n\n\"Gentlemen, our sister.\n\n\"I have her tongue recognized! The language that she speaks, the roots\nof the great Indo-European, or Aryan stock, contains.\n\n\"This girl, gentlemen, to the oldest family of the human race belongs.\nHer language every tongue that now upon the earth is spoken antedates.\nConvinced am I that it that great original speech is from which have all\nthe languages of the civilized world sprung.\n\n\"How she here came, so many millions of miles from the earth, a great\nmystery is. But it shall be penetrated, and it is from her own lips that\nwe shall the truth learn, because not difficult to us shall it be the\nlanguage that she speaks to acquire since to our own it is akin.\"\n\nThis announcement of the Heidelberg professor stirred us all most\nprofoundly. It not only deepened our interest in the beautiful girl whom\nwe had rescued, but, in a dim way, it gave us reason to hope that we\nshould yet discover some means of mastering the Martians by dealing them\na blow from within.\n\nIt had been expected, the reader will remember, that the Martian whom we\nhad made prisoner on the asteroid, might be of use to us in a similar\nway, and for that reason great efforts had been made to acquire his\nlanguage, and considerable progress had been effected in that direction.\n\nBut from the moment of our arrival at Mars itself, and especially after\nthe battles began, the prisoner had resumed his savage and\nuncommunicative disposition, and had seemed continually to be expecting\nthat we would fall victims to the prowess of his fellow beings, and that\nhe would be released. How an outlaw, such as he evidently was, who had\nbeen caught in the act of robbing the Martian gold mines, could expect\nto escape punishment on returning to his native planet it was difficult\nto see. Nevertheless, so strong are the ties of race we could plainly\nperceive that all his sympathies were for his own people.\n\nIn fact, in consequence of his surly manner, and his attempts to escape,\nhe had been more strictly bound than before and to get him out of the\nway had been removed from the flagship, which was already overcrowded,\nand placed in one of the other electric ships, and this ship--as it\nhappened--was one of those which were lost in the great battle beneath\nthe clouds. So after all, the Martian had perished, by a vengeful stroke\nlaunched from his native globe.\n\nBut Providence had placed in our hands a far better interpreter than he\ncould ever have been. This girl of our own race would need no urging, or\ncoercion, on our part in order to induce her to reveal any secrets of\nthe Martians that might be useful in our further proceedings.\n\nBut one thing was first necessary to be done.\n\nWe must learn to talk with her.\n\nBut for the discovery of the store of provisions it would have been\nimpossible for us to spare the time needed to acquire the language of\nthe girl, but now that we had been saved from the danger of starvation,\nwe could prolong the siege for several weeks, employing the intervening\ntime to the best advantage.\n\nThe terrible disaster which we had suffered in the great battle above\nthe Lake of the Sun, wherein we had lost nearly a third of our entire\nforce, had been quite sufficient to convince us that our only hope of\nvictory lay in dealing the Martians some paralyzing stroke that at one\nblow would deprive them of the power of resistance. A victory that cost\nus the loss of a single ship would be too dearly purchased now.\n\nHow to deal that blow, and first of all, how to discover the means of\ndealing it, were at present the uppermost problems in our minds.\n\nThe only hope for us lay in the girl.\n\nIf, as there was every reason to believe, she was familiar with the ways\nand secrets of the Martians, then she might be able to direct our\nefforts in such a manner as to render them effective.\n\n\"We can spare two weeks for this,\" said Mr. Edison. \"Can you fellows of\nmany tongues learn to talk with the girl in that time?\"\n\n\"We'll try it,\" said several.\n\n\"It shall we do,\" cried the Heidelberg professor more confidently.\n\n\"Then there is no use of staying here,\" continued the commander. \"If we\nwithdraw the Martians will think that we have either given up the\nearth's moon, always keep the same face toward their master. By blanket\nand let us see their face once more. That will give us a better\nopportunity to strike effectively when we are again ready.\"\n\n\"Why not rendezvous at one of the moons?\" said an astronomer. \"Neither\nof the two moons is of much consequence, as far as size goes, but still\nit would serve as sort of an anchorage ground, and while there, if we\nwere careful to keep on the side away from Mars, we should escape\ndetection.\"\n\nThis suggestion was immediately accepted, and the squadron having been\nsignalled to assemble quickly bore off in the direction of the more\ndistant moon of Mars, Deimos. We knew that it was slightly smaller than\nPhobos, but its greater distance gave promise that it would better serve\nour purpose of temporary concealment. The moons of Mars, like the\nearth's moon, always kept the same face toward their master. By hiding\nbehind Deimos we should escape the prying eyes of the Martians, even\nwhen they employed telescopes, and thus be able to remain comparatively\nclose at hand, ready to pounce down upon them again, after we had\nobtained, as we now had good hope of doing, information that would make\nus masters of the situation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\n\n_THERE WERE GIANTS IN THE EARTH_\n\n\nDeimos proved to be, as we had expected, about six miles in diameter.\nIts mean density is not very great so that the acceleration of gravity\ndid not exceed one-two-thousandths of the earth's. Consequently the\nweight of a man turning the scales at 150 pounds at home was here only\nabout one ounce.\n\nThe result was that we could move about with greater ease than on the\ngolden asteroid, and some of the scientific men eagerly resumed their\ninterrupted experiments.\n\nBut the attraction of this little satellite was so slight that we had to\nbe very careful not to move too swiftly in going about lest we should\ninvoluntarily leave the ground and sail out into space, as, it will be\nremembered, happened to the fugitives from the fight on the asteroid.\n\nNot only would such an adventure have been an uncomfortable experience,\nbut it might have endangered the success of our scheme. Our present\ndistance from the surface of Mars did not exceed 12,500 miles, and we\nhad reasons to believe the Martians possessed telescopes powerful enough\nto enable them not merely to see the electrical ships at such a\ndistance, but to also catch sight of us individually. Although the cloud\ncurtain still rested on the planet it was probable that the Martians\nwould send some of their airships up to its surface in order to\ndetermine what our fate had been. From that point of vantage with their\nexceedingly powerful glasses, we feared that they might be able to\ndetect anything unusual upon or in the neighborhood of Deimos.\n\nAccordingly strict orders were given, not only that the ships should be\nmoored on that side of the satellite which is perpetually turned away\nfrom Mars, but that, without orders, no one should venture around on the\nother side of the little globe or even on the edge of it, where he might\nbe seen in profile against the sky.\n\nStill, of course, it was essential that we, on our part, should keep a\nclose watch, and so a number of sentinels were selected, whose duty it\nwas to place themselves at the edge of Deimos, where they could peep\nover the horizon, so to speak, and catch sight of the globe of our\nenemies.\n\nThe distance of Mars from us was only about three times its own\ndiameter, consequently it shut off a large part of the sky, as viewed\nfrom our position.\n\nBut in order to see its whole surface it was necessary to go a little\nbeyond the edge of the satellite, on that side which faced Mars. At the\nsuggestion of Colonel Smith, who had so frequently stalked Indians that\ndevices of this kind readily occurred to his mind, the sentinels all\nwore garments corresponding in color to that of the soil of the\nasteroid, which was of a dark, reddish brown hue. This would tend to\nconceal them from the prying eyes of the Martians.\n\nThe commander himself frequently went around the edge of the planet in\norder to take a look at Mars, and I often accompanied him.\n\nI shall never forget one occasion, when, lying flat on the ground, and\ncautiously worming our way around on the side toward Mars, we had just\nbegun to observe it with our telescopes, when I perceived, against the\nvast curtain of smoke, a small, glinting object, which I instantly\nsuspected to be an airship.\n\nI called Mr. Edison's attention to it, and we both agreed that it was,\nundoubtedly, one of the Martian's aerial vessels, probably on the\nlookout for us.\n\nA short time afterward a large number of airships made their appearance\nat the upper surface of the clouds, moving to and fro, and although,\nwith our glasses, we could only make out the general form of the ships,\nwithout being able to discern the Martians upon them, yet we had not the\nleast doubt but they were sweeping the sky in every direction in order\nto determine whether we had been completely destroyed or had retreated\nto a distance from the planet.\n\nEven when that side of Mars on which we were looking had passed into\nnight, we could still see the guardships circling above the clouds,\ntheir presence being betrayed by the faint twinkling of the electric\nlights that they bore.\n\nFinally, after about a week had passed, the Martians evidently made up\ntheir minds that they had annihilated us, and that there was no longer\ndanger to be feared. Convincing evidence that they believed we should\nnot be heard from again was furnished when the withdrawal of the great\ncurtain of cloud began.\n\nThis phenomenon first manifested itself by a gradual thinning of the\nvaporous shield, until, at length, we began to perceive the red surface\nof the planet dimly shining through it. Thinner and rarer it became,\nand, after the lapse of about eighteen hours, it had completely\ndisappeared, and the huge globe shone out again, reflecting the light of\nthe sun from its continents and oceans with a brightness that, in\ncontrast with the all-enveloping night to which we had so long been\nsubjected, seemed unbearable to our eyes.\n\nIndeed, so brilliant was the illumination which fell upon the surface of\nDeimos that the number of persons who had been permitted to pass around\non the exposed side of the satellite was carefully restricted. In the\nblaze of light which had been suddenly poured upon us we felt somewhat\nlike malefactors unexpectedly enveloped in the illumination of a\npoliceman's dark lantern.\n\nMeanwhile, the object which we had in view in retreating to the\nsatellite was not lost sight of, and the services of the chief linguists\nof the expedition were again called into use for the purpose of\nacquiring a new language. The experiment was conducted in the flagship.\nThe fact that this time it was not a monster belonging to an utterly\nalien race upon whom we were to experiment, but a beautiful daughter of\nour common Mother Eve, added zest and interest as well as the most\nconfident hopes of success to the efforts of those who were striving to\nunderstand the accents of her tongue.\n\nStill the difficulty was very great, notwithstanding the conviction of\nthe professors that her language would turn out to be a form of the\ngreat Indo-European speech from which the many tongues of civilized men\nupon the earth had been derived.\n\nThe learned men, to tell the truth, gave the poor girl no rest. For\nhours at a time they would ply her with interrogations by voice and by\ngesture, until, at length, wearied beyond endurance, she would fall\nasleep before their faces.\n\nThen she would be left undisturbed for a little while, but the moment\nher eyes opened again the merciless professors flocked about her once\nmore, and resumed the tedious iteration of their experiments.\n\nOur Heidelberg professor was the chief inquisitor, and he revealed\nhimself to us in a new and entirely unexpected light. No one could have\nanticipated the depth and variety of his resources. He placed himself in\nfront of the girl and gestured and gesticulated, bowed, nodded, shrugged\nhis shoulders, screwed his face into an infinite variety of expressions,\nsmiled, laughed, scowled and accompanied all these dumb shows with\nposturings, exclamations, queries, only half expressed in words and\ncadences which, by some ingenious manipulation of the tones of the\nvoice, he managed to make expressive of his desires.\n\nHe was a universal actor--comedian, tragedian, buffoon--all in one.\nThere was no shade of human emotions to which he did not seem capable of\ngiving expression.\n\nHis every attitude was a symbol, and all his features became in quick\nsuccession types of thought and exponents of hidden feelings, while his\ninquisitive nose stood forth in the midst of their ceaseless play like a\nperpetual interrogation point that would have electrified the Sphinx\ninto life, and set its stone lips gabbling answers and explanations.\n\nThe girl looked on, partly astonished, partly amused, and partly\ncomprehending. Sometimes she smiled, and then the beauty of her face\nbecame most captivating. Occasionally she burst into a cherry laugh when\nthe professor was executing some of his extraordinary gyrations before\nher.\n\nIt was a marvelous exhibition of what the human intellect, when all its\npowers are concentrated upon a single object, is capable of achieving.\nIt seemed to me, as I looked at the performance, that if all the races\nof men, who had been stricken asunder at the foot of the Tower of Babel\nby the miracle which made the tongues of each to speak a language\nunknown to the others, could be brought together again at the foot of\nthe same tower, with all the advantages which thousands of years of\neducation had in the meantime imparted to them, they would be able,\nwithout any miracle, to make themselves mutually understood.\n\nAnd it was evident that an understanding was actually growing between\nthe girl and the professor. Their minds were plainly meeting, and when\nboth had become focused upon the same point, it was perfectly certain\nthat the object of the experiment would be attained.\n\nWhenever the professor got from the girl an intelligent reply to his\npantomimic inquiries, or whenever he believed that he got such a reply,\nit was immediately jotted down in the ever open note book which he\ncarried in his hand.\n\nAnd then he would turn to us standing by, and with one hand on his\nheart, and the other sweeping grandly through the air, would make a\nprofound bow and say:\n\n\"The young lady and I great progress make already. I have her words\ncomprehended. We shall wondrous mysteries solve. Jawohl! Wunderlich!\nMake yourselves gentlemen easy. Of the human race the ancestral stem\nhave I here discovered.\"\n\nOnce I glanced over a page of his notebook and there I read this:\n\n\"Mars--Zahmor\n\n\"Copper--Hayez\n\n\"Sword--Anz\n\n\"I jump--Altesna\n\n\"I slay--Amoutha\n\n\"I cut off a head--Ksutaskofa\n\n\"I sleep--Zlcha\n\n\"I love--Levza\"\n\nWhen I saw this last entry I looked suspiciously at the professor.\n\nWas he trying to make love without our knowing it to the beautiful\ncaptive from Mars?\n\nIf so, I felt certain that he would get himself into difficulty. She had\nmade a deep impression upon every man in the flagship, and I knew that\nthere was more than one of the younger men who would promptly have\ncalled him to account if they had suspected him of trying to learn from\nthose beautiful lips the words, \"I love.\"\n\nI pictured to myself the state of mind of Colonel Alonzo Jefferson Smith\nif, in my place, he had glanced over the notebook and read what I had\nread.\n\nAnd then I thought of another handsome young fellow in the\nflagship--Sydney Phillips--who, if mere actions and looks could make him\nso, had become exceedingly devoted to this long lost and happily\nrecovered daughter of Eve.\n\nIn fact, I had already questioned within my own mind whether the peace\nwould be strictly kept between Colonel Smith and Mr. Phillips, for the\nformer had, to my knowledge, noticed the young fellow's adoring glances,\nand had begun to regard him out of the corners of his eyes as if he\nconsidered him no better than an Apache.\n\n\"But what,\" I asked myself, \"would be the vengeance that Colonel Smith\nwould take upon this skinny professor from Heidelberg if he thought that\nhe, taking advantage of his linguistic powers, had stepped in between\nhim and the damsel whom he had rescued?\"\n\nHowever, when I took a second look at the professor, I became convinced\nthat he was innocent of any such amorous intentions, and that he had\nlearned, or believed he had learned, the word for \"love\" simply in\npursuances of the method by which he meant to acquire the language of\nthe girl.\n\nThere was one thing which gave some of us considerable misgivings, and\nthat was the question whether, after all, the language the professor was\nacquiring was really the girl's own tongue or one that she had learned\nfrom the Martians.\n\nBut the professor bade us rest easy on that point. He assured us, in the\nfirst place, that this girl could not be the only human being living\nupon Mars, but that she must have friends and relatives there. That\nbeing so, they unquestionably had a language of their own, which they\nspoke when they were among themselves. Here finding herself among beings\nbelonging to her own race, she would naturally speak her own tongue and\nnot that which she had acquired from the Martians.\n\n\"Moreover, gentlemen,\" he added, \"I have in her speech many roots of the\ngreat Aryan tongue already recognized.\"\n\nWe were greatly relieved by this explanation, which seemed to all of us\nperfectly satisfactory.\n\nYet, really, there was no reason why one language should be any better\nthan the other for our present purpose. In fact, it might be more useful\nto us to know the language of the Martians themselves. Still, we all\nfelt that we should prefer to know her language rather than that of the\nmonsters among whom she had lived.\n\nColonel Smith expressed what was in all our minds when, after listening\nto the reasoning of the Professor, he blurted out:\n\n\"Thank God, she doesn't speak any of their blamed lingo! By Jove, it\nwould soil her pretty lips.\"\n\n\"But also that she speaks, too,\" said the man from Heidelberg, turning\nto Colonel Smith with a grin. \"We shall both of them eventually learn.\"\n\nThree entire weeks were passed in this manner. After the first week the\ngirl herself materially assisted the linguists in their efforts to\nac-quire her speech.\n\nAt length the task was so far advanced that we could, in a certain\nsense, regard it as practically completed. The Heidelberg professor\ndeclared that he had mastered the tongue of the ancient Aryans. His\ndelight was unbounded. With prodigious industry he set to work, scarcely\nstopping to eat or sleep, to form a grammar of the language.\n\n\"You shall see,\" he said, \"it will the speculations of my countrymen\nvindicate.\"\n\nNo doubt the Professor had an exaggerated opinion of the extent of his\nacquirements, but the fact remained that enough had been learned of the\ngirl's language to enable him and several others to converse with her\nquite as readily as a person of good capacity who has studied under the\ninstructions of a native teacher during a period of six months can\nconverse in a foreign tongue.\n\nImmediately almost every man in the squadron set vigorously at work to\nlearn the language of this fair creature for himself. Colonel Smith and\nSydney Phillips were neck and neck in the linguistic race.\n\nOne of the first bits of information which the Professor had given out\nwas the name of the girl.\n\nIt was Aina (pronounced Ah-ee-na).\n\nThis news was flashed throughout the squadron, and the name of our\nbeautiful captive was on the lips of all.\n\nAfter that came her story. It was a marvelous narrative. Translated into\nour tongue it ran as follows:\n\n\"The traditions of my fathers, handed down for generations so many that\nno one can number them, declare that the planet of Mars was not the\nplace of our origin.\n\n\"Ages and ages ago our forefathers dwelt on another and distant world\nthat was nearer the sun than this one is, and enjoyed brighter daylight\nthan we have here.\n\n\"They dwelt--as I have often heard the story from my father, who had\nlearned it by heart from his father, and he from his--in a beautiful\nvalley that was surrounded by enormous mountains towering into the\nclouds and white about their tops with snow that never melted. In the\nvalley were lakes, around which clustered the dwellings of our race.\n\n\"It was, the traditions say, a land wonderful for its fertility, filled\nwith all things that the heart could desire, splendid with flowers and\nrich with luscious fruits.\n\n\"It was a land of music, and the people who dwelt in it were very\nhappy.\"\n\nWhile the girl was telling this part of her story the Heidelberg\nprofessor became visibly more and more excited. Presently he could keep\nquiet no longer, and suddenly exclaimed, turning to us who were\nlistening, as the words of the girl were interpreted for us by one of\nthe other linguists:\n\n\"Gentlemen, it is the Vale of Cashmere! Has not my great countryman,\nAdelung, so declared? Has he not said that the Valley of Cashmere was\nthe cradle of the human race already?\"\n\n\"From the Valley of Cashmere to the planet Mars--what a romance!\"\nexclaimed one of the bystanders.\n\nColonel Smith appeared to be particularly moved, and I heard him humming\nunder his breath, greatly to my astonishment, for this rough soldier was\nnot much given to poetry or music:\n\n    \"Who has not heard of the Vale of Cashmere,\n      With its roses the brightest that earth ever gave;\n    Its temples, its grottoes, its fountains as clear,\n      As the love-lighted eyes that hang 'oer the wave.\"\n\nMr. Sydney Phillips, standing by, and also catching the murmur of\nColonel Smith's words, showed in his handsome countenance some\nindications of distress, as if he wished he had thought of those lines\nhimself.\n\nThe girl resumed her narrative:\n\n\"Suddenly there dropped down out of the sky strange gigantic enemies,\narmed with mysterious weapons, and began to slay and burn and make\ndesolate. Our forefathers could not withstand them. They seemed like\ndemons, who had been sent from the abodes of evil to destroy our race.\n\n\"Some of the wise men said that this thing had come upon our people\nbecause they had been very wicked, and the Gods in Heaven were angry.\nSome said they came from the moon, and some from the far-away stars. But\nof these things my forefathers knew nothing for a certainty.\n\n\"The destroyers showed no mercy to the inhabitants of the beautiful\nvalley. Not content with making it a desert, they swept over other parts\nof the earth.\n\n\"The tradition says that they carried off from the valley, which was our\nnative land, a large number of our people, taking them first into a\nstrange country, where there were oceans of sand, but where a great\nriver, flowing through the midst of the sands, created a narrow land of\nfertility. Here, after having slain and driven out the native\ninhabitants, they remained for many years, keeping our people, whom they\nhad carried into captivity, as slaves.\n\n\"And in this Land of Sand, it is said, they did many wonderful works.\n\n\"They had been astonished at the sight of the great mountains which\nsurrounded our valley, for on Mars there are no mountains, and after\nthey came into the Land of Sand they built there, with huge blocks of\nstone, mountains in imitation of what they had seen, and used them for\npurposes my people did not understand.\n\n\"Then, too, it is said they left there at the foot of these mountains\nthat they had made a gigantic image of the great chief who led them in\ntheir conquest of our world.\"\n\nAt this point in the story the Heidelberg professor again broke in,\nfairly trembling with excitement:\n\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen,\" he cried, \"is it that you do not understand?\nThis Land of Sand and of a wonderful fertilizing river--what can it be?\nGentleman, it is Egypt! These mountains of rock that the Martians have\nerected, what are they? Gentlemen, they are the great mystery of the\nland of the Nile, the Pyramids. The gigantic statue of their leader that\nthey at the foot of their artificial mountains have set up--gentlemen,\nwhat is that? It is the Sphinx!\"\n\n[Illustration: _\"Gentlemen,\" exclaimed the Professor, \"these mountains of\nrock that the Martians built are the Pyramids of Egypt. The gigantic\nstatue of their leader is THE GREAT SPHINX!\"_]\n\nThe professor's agitation was so great that he could not go on further.\nAnd indeed there was not one of us who did not fully share his\nexcitement. To think that we should have come to the planet Mars to\nsolve one of the standing mysteries of the earth, which had puzzled\nmankind and defied all their efforts at solution for so many centuries!\nHere, then, was the explanation of how those gigantic blocks that\nconstitute the great Pyramid of Cheops had been swung to their lofty\nelevation. It was not the work of puny man, as many an engineer had\ndeclared that it could not be, but the work of these giants of Mars.\n\nAt length, our traditions say, a great pestilence broke out in the Land\nof Sand, and a partial vengeance was granted to us in the destruction of\nthe larger number of our enemies. At last the giants who remained,\nfleeing before this scourge of the gods, used the mysterious means at\ntheir command, and, carrying our ancestors with them, returned to their\nown world, in which we have ever since lived.\n\n\"Then there are more of your people in Mars?\" said one of the\nprofessors.\n\n\"Alas, no,\" replied Aina, her eyes filling with tears, \"I alone am\nleft.\"\n\nFor a few minutes she was unable to speak. Then she continued:\n\n\"What fury possessed them I do not know, but not long ago an expedition\ndeparted from the planet, the purpose of which, as it was noised about\nover Mars, was the conquest of a distant world. After a time a few\nsurvivors of that expedition returned. The story they told caused great\nexcitement among our masters. They had been successful in their battles\nwith the inhabitants of the world they had invaded, but as in the days\nof our forefathers, in the Land of Sand, a pestilence smote them, and\nbut few survivors escaped.\n\n\"Not long after that, you, with your mysterious ships, appeared in the\nsky of Mars. Our masters studied you with their telescopes, and those\nwho had returned from the unfortunate expedition declared that you were\ninhabitants of the world which they had invaded, come, doubtless, to\ntake vengeance upon them.\n\n\"Some of my people who were permitted to look through the telescopes of\nthe Martians, saw you also, and recognized you as members of their own\nrace. There were several thousand of us all together, and we were kept\nby the Martians to serve them as slaves, and particularly to delight\ntheir ears with music, for our people have always been especially\nskillful in the playing of musical instruments, and in songs, and while\nthe Martians have but little musical skill themselves, they are\nexceedingly fond of these things.\n\n\"Although Mars had completed not less than five thousand circuits about\nthe sun since our ancestors were brought as prisoners to its surface,\nyet the memory of our distant home had never perished from the hearts of\nour race, and when we recognized you, as we believed, our own brothers,\ncome to rescue us from long imprisonment, there was great rejoicing. The\nnews spread from mouth to mouth, wherever we were in houses and families\nof our masters. We seemed to be powerless to aid you or to communicate\nwith you in any manner. Yet our hearts went out to you, as in your ships\nyou hung above the planet, and preparations were secretly made by all\nthe members of our race for your reception when, as we believed, would\noccur, you should effect a landing upon the planet and destroy our\nenemies.\n\n\"But in some manner the fact that we had recognized you, and were\npreparing to welcome you, came to the ears of the Martians.\"\n\nAt this point the girl suddenly covered her eyes with her hands,\nshuddering and falling back in her seat.\n\n\"Oh, you do not know them as I do!\" at length she exclaimed. \"The\nmonsters! Their vengeance was too terrible! Instantly the order went\nforth that we should all be butchered, and that awful command was\nexecuted!\"\n\n\"How, then, did you escape?\" asked the Heidelberg professor.\n\nAina seemed unable to speak for a while. Finally mastering her emotion,\nshe replied:\n\n\"One of the chief officers of the Martians wished me to remain alive.\nHe, with his aides, carried me to one of the military depots of\nsupplies, where I was found and rescued,\" and as she said this she\nturned toward Colonel Smith with a smile that reflected on his ruddy\nface and made it glow like a Chinese lantern.\n\n\"By God!\" muttered Colonel Smith, \"that was the fellow we blew into\nnothing! Blast him, he got off too easy!\"\n\nThe remainder of Aina's story may be briefly told.\n\nWhen Colonel Smith and I entered the mysterious building which, as it\nnow proved, was not a storehouse belonging to a village, as we had\nsupposed, but one of the military depots of the Martians, the girl, on\ncatching sight of us, immediately recognized us as belonging to the\nstrange squadron in the sky. As such she felt that we must be her\nfriends, and saw in us her only possible hope of escape. For that reason\nshe had instantly thrown herself under our protection. This accounted\nfor the singular confidence which she had manifested in us from the\nbeginning.\n\nHer wonderful story had so captivated our imaginations that for a long\ntime after it was finished we could not recover from the spell. It was\ntold over and over again, from mouth to mouth, and repeated from ship to\nship, everywhere exciting the utmost astonishment.\n\nDestiny seemed to have sent us on this expedition into space for the\npurpose of clearing off mysteries that had long puzzled the minds of\nmen. When on the moon we had unexpectedly to ourselves settled the\nquestion that had been debated from the beginning of astronomical\nhistory of the former habitability of that globe.\n\nNow, on Mars, we had put to rest no less mysterious questions relating\nto the past history of our own planet. Adelung, as the Heidelberg\nprofessor asserted, had named the Vale of Cashmere, as the probable site\nof the Garden of Eden, and the place of origin of the human race, but\nlater investigators had taken issue with this opinion and the question\nwhere the Aryans originated on the earth had long been one of the most\npuzzling that science presented.\n\nThis question seemed now to have been settled.\n\nAina had said that Mars had completed 5,000 circuits about the sun since\nher people were brought to it as captives. One circuit of Mars occupies\n687 days. More than 9000 years had therefore elapsed since the first\ninvasion of the earth by the Martians.\n\nAnother great mystery--that of the origin of those gigantic and\ninexplicable monuments, the great pyramids and the Sphinx, on the banks\nof the Nile, had also apparently been solved by us, although these\nEgyptian wonders had been the furthest things from our thoughts when we\nset out for the planet Mars.\n\nWe had traveled more than thirty millions of miles in order to get\nanswers to questions which could not be solved at home.\n\nBut from these speculations and retrospects we were recalled by the\ncommander of the expedition.\n\n\"This is all very interesting and very romantic, gentlemen,\" he said,\n\"but now let us get at the practical side of it. We have learned Aina's\nlanguage and heard her story. Let us next ascertain whether she can not\nplace in our hands some key which will place Mars at our mercy. Remember\nwhat we came here for, and remember that the earth expects every man of\nus to do his duty.\"\n\nThis Nelson-like summons again changed the current of our thoughts, and\nwe instantly set to work to learn from Aina if Mars, like Achilles, had\nnot some vulnerable point where a blow would be mortal.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\n\n_THE FLOOD GATES OF MARS_\n\n\nIt was a curious scene when the momentous interview which was to\ndetermine our fate and that of Mars began. Aina had been warned of what\nwas coming. We in the flagship had all learned to speak her language\nwith more or less ease, but it was deemed best that the Heidelberg\nprofessor, assisted by one of his colleagues, should act as interpreter.\n\nThe girl, flushed with excitement of the novel situation, fully\nappreciating the importance of what was about to occur, and looking more\ncharming than before, stood at one side of the principal apartment.\nDirectly facing her were the interpreters, and the rest of us, all with\nears intent and eyes focused upon Aina, stood in a double row behind\nthem. As heretofore, I am setting down her words translated into our own\ntongue, having taken only so much liberty as to connect the sentences\ninto a stricter sequence than they had when falling from her lips in\nreply to the questions which were showered upon her.\n\n\"You will never be victorious,\" she said, \"if you attack them openly as\nyou have been doing. They are too strong and too numerous. They are well\nprepared for such attacks, because they have had to resist them before.\n\n\"They have waged war with the inhabitants of the asteroid Ceres, whose\npeople are giants greater than themselves. Their enemies from Ceres have\nattacked them here. Hence these fortifications, with weapons pointing\nskyward, and the great air fleets which you have encountered.\"\n\n\"But there must be some point,\" said Mr. Edison, \"where we can.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" interrupted the girl quickly, \"there is one blow you can\ndeal them which they could not withstand.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" eagerly inquired the commander.\n\n\"You can drown them out.\"\n\n\"How? With the canals?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will explain to you. I have already told you, and, in fact, you\nmust have seen for yourselves, that there are almost no mountains on\nMars. A very learned man of my race used to say that the reason was\nbecause Mars is so very old a world that the mountains it once had have\nbeen almost completely leveled, and the entire surface of the planet had\nbecome a great plain. There are depressions, however, most of which are\noccupied by the seas. The greater part of the land lies below the level\nof the ocean. In order at the same time to irrigate the soil and make it\nfruitful, and to protect themselves from overflows by the ocean breaking\nin upon them, the Martians have constructed the immense and innumerable\ncanals which you see running in all directions over the continents.\n\n\"There is one period in the year, and that period has now arrived when\nthere is special danger of a great deluge. Most of the oceans of Mars\nlie in the southern hemisphere. When it is Summer in that hemisphere,\nthe great masses of ice and snow collected around the south pole melt\nrapidly away.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is so,\" broke in one of the astronomers, who was listening\nattentively. \"Many a time I have seen the vast snow fields around the\nsouthern pole of Mars completely disappear as the Summer sun rose high\nupon them.\"\n\n\"With the melting of these snows,\" continued Aina, \"a rapid rise in the\nlevel of the water in the southern oceans occurs. On the side facing\nthese oceans the continents of Mars are sufficiently elevated to prevent\nan overflow, but nearer the equator the level of the land sinks lower.\n\n\"With your telescopes you have no doubt noticed that there is a great\nbending sea connecting the oceans of the south with those of the north\nand running through the midst of the continents.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said the astronomer who had spoken before, \"we call it the\nSyrtis Major.\"\n\n\"That long narrow sea,\" Aina went on, \"forms a great channel through\nwhich the flood of waters caused by the melting of the southern polar\nsnows flows swiftly toward the equator and then on toward the north\nuntil it reaches the sea basins which exist there. At that point it is\nrapidly turned into ice and snow, because, of course, while it is Summer\nin the southern hemisphere it is Winter in the northern.\n\n\"The Syrtis Major (I am giving our name to the channel of communication\nin place of that by which the girl called it) is like a great safety\nvalve, which, by permitting the waters to flow northward, saves the\ncontinents from inundation.\n\n\"But when mid-Summer arrives, the snows around the pole, having been\ncompletely melted away, the flood ceases and the water begins to recede.\nAt this time, but for a device which the Martians have employed, the\ncanals connected with the oceans would run dry, and the vegetation left\nwithout moisture under the Summer sun, would quickly perish.\n\n\"To prevent this they have built a series of enormous gates extending\ncompletely across the Syrtis Major at its narrowest point (latitude 25\ndegrees south). These gates are all controlled by machinery collected at\na single point on the shore of the strait. As soon as the flood in the\nSyrtis Major begins to recede, the gates are closed, and, the water\nbeing thus restrained, the irrigating canals are kept full long enough\nto mature the harvests.\"\n\n\"The clue! The clue at last!\" exclaimed Mr. Edison. \"That is the place\nwhere we shall nip them. If we can close those gates now at the moment\nof high tide we shall flood the country. Did you say,\" he continued,\nturning to Aina, \"that the movement of the gates was all controlled from\na single point?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the girl. \"There is a great building (power house) full of\ntremendous machinery which I once entered when my father was taken there\nby his master, and where I saw one Martian, by turning a little handle,\ncause the great line of gates, stretching a hundred miles across the\nsea, to slowly shut in, edge to edge, until the flow of the water toward\nthe north had been stopped.\"\n\n\"How is the building protected?\"\n\n\"So completely,\" said Aina, \"that my only fear is that you may not be\nable to reach it. On account of the danger from their enemies on Ceres,\nthe Martians have fortified it strongly on all sides, and have even\nsurrounded it and covered it overhead with a great electrical network,\nto touch which would be instant death.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Mr. Edison, \"they have got an electric shield, have they?\nWell, I think we shall be able to manage that.\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" he continued, \"we have got to get into that power house, and\nwe have got to close those gates, and we must not lose much time in\nmaking up our minds how it is to be done. Evidently this is our only\nchance. We have not force enough to contend in open battle with the\nMartians, but if we can flood them out, and thereby render the engines\ncontained in their fortifications useless, perhaps we shall be able to\ndeal with the airships, which will be all the means of defense that will\nthen remain to them.\"\n\nThis idea commended itself to all the leaders of the expedition. It was\ndetermined to make a reconnaissance at once.\n\nBut it would not do for us to approach the planet too hastily, and we\ncertainly could not think of landing upon it in broad daylight. Still,\nas long as we were yet a considerable distance from Mars, we felt that\nwe should be safe from observation because so much time had elapsed\nwhile we were hidden behind Deimos that the Martians had undoubtedly\nconcluded that we were no longer in existance.\n\nSo we boldly quitted the little satellite with our entire squadron and\nonce more rapidly approached the red planet of war. This time it was to\nbe a death grapple and our chances of victory still seemed good.\n\nAs soon as we arrived so near the planet that there was danger of our\nbeing actually seen, we took pains to keep continually in the shadow of\nMars, and the more surely to conceal our presence all lights upon the\nships were extinguished. The precaution of the commander even went so\nfar as to have the smooth metallic sides of the cars blackened over so\nthat they should not reflect light, and thus become visible to the\nMartians as shining specks, moving suspiciously among the stars.\n\nThe precise location of the great power house on the shores of the\nSyrtis Major having been carefully ascertained, the squadron dropped\ndown one night into the upper limits of the Martian atmosphere, directly\nover the gulf.\n\nThen a consultation was called on the flagship and a plan of campaign\nwas quickly devised.\n\nIt was deemed wise that the attempt should be made with a single\nelectric ship, but that the others should be kept hovering near, ready\nto respond on the instant to any signal for aid which might come from\nbelow. It was thought that, notwithstanding the wonderful defences,\nwhich, according to Aina's account surrounded the building, a small\nparty would have a better chance of success than a large one.\n\nMr. Edison was certain that the electrical network which was described\nas covering the power house would not prove a serious obstruction to us,\nbecause by carefully sweeping the space where we intended to pass with\nthe disintegrators before quitting the ship, the netting could be\nsufficiently cleared away to give us uninterrupted passage.\n\nAt first the intention was to have twenty men, each armed with two\ndisintegrators (that being the largest number one person could carry to\nadvantage) descend from the electrical ship and make the venture. But,\nafter further discussion, this number was reduced; first to a dozen, and\nfinally, to only four. These four consisted of Mr. Edison, Colonel\nSmith, Mr. Sydney Phillips and myself.\n\nBoth by her own request and because we could not help feeling that her\nknowledge of the locality would be indispensable to us, Aina was also\nincluded in our party, but not, of course, as a fighting member of it.\n\nIt was about an hour after midnight when the ship in which we were to\nmake the venture parted from the remainder of the squadron and dropped\ncautiously down. The blaze of electric lights running away in various\ndirections indicated the lines of innumerable canals with habitations\ncrowded along their banks, which came to a focus at a point on the\ncontinent of Aeria, westward from the Syrtis Major.\n\nWe stopped the electrical ship at an elevation of perhaps three hundred\nfeet above the vast roof of a structure which Aina assured us was the\nbuilding of which we were in search.\n\nHere we remained for a few minutes, cautiously reconnoitering. On that\nside of the power house which was opposite to the shore of the Syrtis\nMajor there was a thick grove of trees, lighted beneath, as was apparent\nfrom the illumination which here and there streamed up through the cover\nof leaves, but, nevertheless, dark and gloomy above the tree tops.\n\n\"The electric network extends over the grove as well as over the\nbuilding,\" said Aina.\n\nThis was lucky for us, because we wished to descend among the trees,\nand, by destroying part of the network over the tree tops, we could\nreach the shelter we desired and at the same time pass within the line\nof electric defenses.\n\nWith increased caution, and almost holding our breath lest we should\nmake some noise that might reach the ears of the sentinels below, we\ncaused the car to settle gently down until we caught sight of a metallic\nnet stretched in the air between us and the trees.\n\nAfter our first encounter with the Martians on the asteroid, where, as I\nhave related, some metal which was included in their dress resisted the\naction of the disintegrators, Mr. Edison had readjusted the range of\nvibrations covered by the instruments, and since then we had found\nnothing that did not yield to them. Consequently, we had no fear that\nthe metal of the network would not be destroyed.\n\nThere was danger, however, of arousing attention by shattering holes\nthrough the tree tops. This could be avoided by first carefully\nascertaining how far away the network was and then with the adjustable\nmirrors attached to the disintegrators focusing the vibratory discharge\nat that distance.\n\nSo successful were we that we opened a considerable gap in the network\nwithout doing any perceptible damage to the trees beneath.\n\nThe ship was cautiously lowered through the opening and brought to rest\namong the upper branches of one of the tallest trees. Colonel Smith, Mr.\nPhillips, Mr. Edison and myself at once clambered out upon a strong\nlimb.\n\nFor a moment I feared our arrival had been betrayed on account of the\naltogether too noisy contest that arose between Colonel Smith and Mr.\nPhillips as to which of them should assist Aina. To settle the dispute I\ntook charge of her myself.\n\nAt length we were all safely in the tree.\n\nThen followed the still more dangerous undertaking of descending from\nthis great height to the ground. Fortunately, the branches were very\nclose together and they extended down within a short distance of the\nsoil. So the actual difficulties of the descent were not very great\nafter all. The one thing that we had particularly to bear in mind was\nthe absolute necessity of making no noise.\n\nAt length the descent was successfully accomplished, and we all five\nstood together in the shadow at the foot of the great tree. The grove\nwas so thick around that while there was an abundance of electric lights\namong the trees, their illumination did not fall upon us where we stood.\n\nPeering cautiously through the vistas in various directions, we\nascertained our location with respect to the wall of the building. Like\nall the structures which we had seen on Mars, it was composed of\npolished red metal.\n\n\"Where is the entrance?\" inquired Mr. Edison, in a whisper.\n\n\"Come softly this way, and look out for the sentinel,\" replied Aina.\n\nGripping our disintegrators firmly, and screwing up our courage, with\nnoiseless steps we followed the girl among the shadows of the trees.\n\nWe had one-very great advantage. The Martians had evidently placed so\nmuch confidence in the electric network which surrounded the power house\nthat they never dreamed of enemies being able to penetrate it--at least,\nwithout giving warning of their coming.\n\nBut the hole which we had blown in this network with the disintegrators\nhad been made noiselessly, and Mr. Edison believed, since no enemies had\nappeared, that our operations had not been betrayed by any automatic\nsignal to watchers inside the building.\n\nConsequently, we had every reason to think that we now stood within the\nline of defense, in which they reposed the greatest confidence, without\ntheir having the least suspicion of our presence.\n\nAina assured us that on the occasion of her former visit to the power\nhouse there had been but two sentinels on guard at the entrance. At the\ninner end of a long passage leading to the interior, she said, there\nwere two more. Besides these there were three or four Martian engineers\nwatching the machinery in the interior of the building. A number of\nairships were supposed to be on guard around the structure, but possibly\ntheir vigilance had been relaxed, because not long ago the Martians had\nsent an expedition against Ceres which had been so successful that the\npower of that planet to make any attack upon Mars had, for the present\nbeen destroyed.\n\nSupposing us to have been annihilated in the recent battle among the\nclouds, they would have no fear or cause for vigilance on our account.\n\nThe entrance to the great structure was low--at least, when measured by\nthe stature of the Martians. Evidently the intention was that only one\nperson at a time should find room to pass through it.\n\nDrawing cautiously near, we discerned the outlines of two gigantic\nforms, standing in the darkness, one on either side of the door. Colonel\nSmith whispered to me:\n\n\"If you will take the fellow on the right, I will attend to the other\none.\"\n\nAdjusting our aim as carefully as was possible in the gloom, Colonel\nSmith and I simultaneously discharged our disintegrators, sweeping them\nrapidly up and down in the manner which had become familiar to us when\nendeavoring to destroy one of the gigantic Martians with a single\nstroke. And so successful were we that the two sentinels disappeared as\nif they were ghosts of the night.\n\nInstantly we all hurried forward and entered the door. Before us\nextended a long, straight passage, brightly illuminated by a number of\nelectric candles. Its polished sides gleamed with blood-red reflections,\nand the gallery terminated, at a distance of two or three hundred feet,\nwith an opening into a large chamber beyond, on the further side of\nwhich we could see part of a gigantic and complicated mass of machinery.\n\nMaking as little noise as possible, we pushed ahead along the passage,\nbut when we had arrived within the distance of a dozen paces from the\ninner end, we stopped, and Colonel Smith, getting down upon his knees,\ncrept forward, until he had reached the inner end of the passage. There\nhe peered cautiously around the edge into the chamber, and, turning his\nhead a moment later, beckoned us to come forward. We crept to his side,\nand, looking out into the vast apartment, could perceive no enemies.\n\nWhat had become of the sentinels supposed to stand at the inner end the\npassage we could not imagine. At any rate, they were not at their posts.\n\nThe chamber was an immense square room at least a hundred feet in height\nand 400 feet on a side, and almost filling the wall opposite to us was\nan intricate display of machinery, wheels, levers, rods and polished\nplates. This we had no doubt was one end of the engine which opened and\nshut the great gates that could dam an ocean.\n\n\"There is no one in sight,\" said Colonel Smith.\n\n\"Then we must act quickly,\" said Mr. Edison.\n\n\"Where,\" he said, turning to Aina, \"is the handle by turning which you\nsaw the Martian close the gates?\"\n\nAina looked about in bewilderment. The mechanism before us was so\ncomplicated that even an expert mechanic would have been excusable for\nfinding himself unable to understand it. There were scores of knobs and\nhandles, all glistening in the electric light, any one of which, so far\nas the uninstructed could tell, might have been the master key that\ncontrolled the whole complex apparatus.\n\n\"Quick,\" said Mr. Edison, \"where is it?\"\n\nThe girl in her confusion ran this way and that, gazing hopelessly upon\nthe machinery, but evidently utterly unable to help us.\n\nTo remain here inactive was not merely to invite destruction for\nourselves, but was sure to bring certain failure upon the purpose of the\nexpedition. All of us began instantly to look about in search of the\nproper handle, seizing every crank and wheel in sight and striving to\nturn it.\n\n\"Stop that!\" shouted Mr. Edison, \"you may set the whole thing wrong.\nDon't touch anything until we have found the right lever.\"\n\nBut to find that seemed to most of us now utterly beyond the power of\nman.\n\nIt was at this critical moment that the wonderful depth and reach of Mr.\nEdison's mechanical genius displayed itself. He stepped back, ran his\neyes quickly over the whole immense mass of wheels, handles, bolts, bars\nand levers, paused for an instant, as if making up his mind, then said\ndecidedly, \"There it is,\" and stepping quickly forward, selected a small\nwheel amid a dozen others, all furnished at the circumference with\nhandles like those of a pilot's wheel, and giving it a quick wrench,\nturned it half-way around.\n\nAt this instant, a startling shout fell upon our ears. There was a\nthunderous clatter behind us, and, turning, we saw three gigantic\nMartians rushing forward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\n\n_VENGEANCE IS OURS_\n\n\n\"Sweep them! sweep them!\" shouted Colonel Smith, as he brought his\ndisintegrator to bear. Mr. Phillips and I instantly followed his\nexample, and thus we swept the Martians into eternity, while Mr. Edison\ncoolly continued his manipulations of the wheel.\n\nThe effect of what he was doing became apparent in less than half a\nminute. A shiver ran through the mass of machinery and shook the entire\nbuilding.\n\n\"Look! Look!\" cried Sydney Phillips, who had stepped a little apart from\nthe others.\n\nWe all ran to his side and found ourselves in front of a great window\nwhich opened through the side of the engine, giving a view of what lay\nin front of it. There, gleaming in the electric lights, we saw Syrtis\nMajor, its waters washing high against the walls of the vast power\nhouse. Running directly out from the shore, there was an immense\nmetallic gate at least 400 yards in length and rising three hundred feet\nabove the present level of the water.\n\nThis great gate was slowly swinging upon an invisible hinge in such a\nmanner that in a few minutes it would evidently stand across the current\nof the Syrtis Major at right angles.\n\nBeyond was a second gate, which was moving in the same manner. Further\non was a third gate, and then another, and another, as far as the eye\ncould reach, evidently extending in an unbroken series completely across\nthe great strait.\n\nAs the gates, with accelerated motion when the current caught them,\nclanged together, we beheld a spectacle that almost stopped the beating\nof our hearts.\n\nThe great Syrtis seemed to gather itself for a moment, and then it\nleaped upon the obstruction and buried its waters into one vast foaming\ngeyser that seemed to shoot a thousand feet skyward.\n\nBut the metal gates withstood the shock, though buried from our sight in\nthe seething white mass, and the baffled waters instantly swirled around\nin ten thousand gigantic eddies, rising to the level of our window and\nbeginning to inundate the power house before we fairly comprehended our\nperil.\n\n\"We have done the work,\" said Mr. Edison, smiling grimly. \"Now we had\nbetter get out of this before the flood bursts upon us.\"\n\nThe warning came none too soon. It was necessary to act upon it at once\nif we would save our lives. Even before we could reach the entrance to\nthe long passage through which we had come into the great engine room,\nthe water had risen half-way to our knees. Colonel Smith, catching Aina\nunder his arm, led the way. The roar of the maddened torrent behind\ndeafened us.\n\nAs we ran through the passage the water followed us, with a wicked\nswishing sound, and within five seconds it was above our knees; in ten\nseconds up to our waists.\n\nThe great danger now was that we should be swept from our feet, and once\ndown in that torrent there would have been little chance of our ever\ngetting our heads above its level. Supporting ourselves as best we could\nwith the aid of the walls, we partly ran, and were partly swept along,\nuntil when we reached the outer end of the passage and emerged into the\nopen air, the flood was swirling about our shoulders.\n\nHere there was an opportunity to clutch some of the ornamental work\nsurrounding the doorway, and thus we managed to stay our mad progress,\nand gradually to work out of the current until we found that the water,\nhaving now an abundance of room to spread, had fallen again as low as\nour knees.\n\nBut suddenly we heard the thunder of the banks tumbling behind us, and\nto the right and left, and the savage growl of the released water as it\nsprang through the breaches.\n\nTo my dying day, I think, I shall not forget the sight of a great fluid\ncolumn that burst through the dike at the edge of the grove of trees,\nand, by the tremendous impetus of its rush, seemed turned into a solid\nthing.\n\nLike an enormous ram, it plowed the soil to a depth of twenty feet,\nuprooting acres of the immense trees like stubble turned over by the\nplowshare.\n\nThe uproar was so awful that for an instant the coolest of us lost our\nself-control. Yet we knew that we had not the fraction of a second to\nwaste. The breaking of the banks had caused the water again rapidly to\nrise about us. In a little while it was once more as high as our waists.\n\nIn the excitement and confusion, deafened by the noise and blinded by\nthe flying foam, we were in danger of becoming separated in the flood.\nWe no longer knew certainly in what direction was the tree by whose aid\nwe had ascended from the electrical ship. We pushed first one way and\nthen another, staggering through the rushing waters in search of it.\nFinally we succeeded in locating it, and with all our strength hurried\ntoward it.\n\nThen there came a noise as if the globe of Mars had been split asunder,\nand another great head of water hurled itself down upon the soil before\nus, and, without taking time to spread, bored a vast cavity in the\nground, and scooped out the whole of the grove before our eyes as easily\nas a gardener lifts a sod with his spade.\n\nOur last hope was gone. For a moment the level of the water around us\nsank again, as it poured into the immense excavation where the grove had\nstood, but in an instant it was reinforced from all sides and began once\nmore rapidly to rise.\n\nWe gave ourselves up for lost, and, indeed, there did not seem any\npossible hope of salvation.\n\nEven in the extremity I saw Colonel Smith lifting the form of Aina, who\nhad fainted, above the surface of the surging water, while Sydney\nPhillips stood by his side and aided him in supporting the unconscious\ngirl.\n\n\"We stayed a little too long,\" was the only sound I heard from Mr.\nEdison.\n\nThe huge bulk of the power house partially protected us against the\nforce of the current, and the water spun us around in great eddies.\nThese swept us this way and that, but yet we managed to cling together,\ndetermined not to be separated in death if we could avoid it.\n\nSuddenly a cry rang out directly above our heads:\n\n\"Jump for your lives, and be quick!\"\n\nAt the same instant the ends of several ropes splashed into the water.\n\nWe glanced upward, and there, within three or four yards of our heads,\nhung the electrical ship, which we had left moored at the top of the\ntree.\n\nTom, the expert electrician from Mr. Edison's shop, who had remained in\ncharge of the ship, had never once dreamed of such a thing as deserting\nus. The moment he saw the water bursting over the dam, and evidently\nflooding the building which we had entered, he cast off his moorings, as\nwe subsequently learned, and hovered over the entrance to the power\nhouse, getting as low down as possible and keeping a sharp watch for us.\n\nBut most of the electric lights in the vicinity had been carried down by\nthe first rush of water, and in the darkness he did not see us when we\nemerged from the entrance. It was only after the sweeping away of the\ngrove of trees had allowed a flood of light to stream upon the scene\nfrom a cluster of electric lamps on a distant portion of the bank on the\nSyrtis that had not yet given way that he caught sight of us.\n\nImmediately he began to shout to attract our attention, but in the awful\nuproar we could not hear him. Getting together all the ropes that he\ncould lay his hands on, he steered the ship to a point directly over us,\nand then dropped down within a few yards of the boiling flood.\n\nNow as he hung over our heads, and saw the water up to our very necks\nand still swiftly rising, he shouted again:\n\n\"Catch hold, for God's sake!\"\n\nThe three men who were with him in the ship seconded his cries.\n\nBut by the time we had fairly grasped the ropes, so rapidly was the\nflood rising, we were already afloat. With the assistance of Tom and his\nmen we were rapidly drawn up, and immediately Tom reversed the electric\npolarity, and the ship began to rise.\n\nAt that same instant, with a crash that shivered the air, the immense\nmetallic power house gave way and was swept tumbling, like a hill torn\nloose from its base, over the very spot where a moment before we had\nstood. One second's hesitation on the part of Tom, and the electrical\nship would have been battered into a shapeless wad of metal by the\ncareening mass.\n\nWhen we had attained a considerable height, so that we could see a great\ndistance on either side, the spectacle became even more fearful than it\nwas when we were close to the surface.\n\nOn all sides banks and dykes were going down; trees were being uprooted;\nbuildings were tumbling, and the ocean was achieving that victory over\nthe land which had long been its due, but which the ingenuity of the\ninhabitants of Mars had postponed for ages.\n\nFar away we could see the front of the advancing wave crested with foam\nthat sparkled in the electric lights, and as it swept on it changed the\nentire aspect of the planet--in front of it all life, behind it all\ndeath.\n\nEastward our view extended across the Syrtis Major toward the land of\nLibya and the region of Isidis. On that side also the dykes were giving\nway under the tremendous pressure, and the floods were rushing toward\nthe sunrise, which had just began to streak the eastern sky.\n\nThe continents that were being overwhelmed on the western side of the\nSyrtis were Meroc, Aeria, Arabia, Edom and Eden.\n\nThe water beneath us continually deepened. The current from the melting\nsnows around the southern pole was at its strongest, and one could\nhardly have believed that any obstruction put in its path would have\nbeen able to arrest it and turn it into these two all-swallowing\ndeluges, sweeping east and west. But, as we now perceived, the level of\nthe land over a large part of its surface was hundreds of feet below the\nocean, so that the latter, when once the barriers were broken, rushed\ninto depressions that yawned to receive it.\n\nThe point where we had dealt our blow was far removed from the great\ncapitol of Mars, around the Lake of the Sun, and we knew that we should\nhave to wait for the floods to reach that point before the desired\neffect could be produced. By the nearest way, the water had at least\n5,000 miles to travel. We estimated that its speed where we hung above\nit was as much as a hundred miles an hour. Even if that speed were\nmaintained, more than two days and nights would be required for the\nfloods to reach the Lake of the Sun.\n\nBut as the water rushed on it would break the banks of all the canals\nintersecting the country, and these, being also elevated above the\nsurface, would add the impetus of their escaping waters to hasten the\nadvance of the flood. We calculated, therefore, that about two days\nwould suffice to place the planet at our mercy.\n\nHalf way from the Syrtis Major to the Lake of the Sun another great\nconnecting link between the Southern and Northern ocean basins, called\non our maps of Mars the Indus, existed, and through this channel we knew\nthat another great current must be setting from the south toward the\nnorth. The flood that we had started would reach and break the banks of\nthe Indus within one day.\n\nThe flood traveling in the other direction, toward the east, would have\nconsiderably further to go before reaching the neighborhood of the Lake\nof the Sun. It, too, would involve hundreds of great canals as it\nadvanced and would come plunging upon the Lake of the Sun and its\nsurrounding forts and cities, probably about half a day later than the\narrival of the deluge that traveled toward the west.\n\nNow that we had let the awful destroyer loose we almost shrank from the\nthought of the consequences which we had produced. How many millions\nwould perish as the result of our deed we could not even guess. Many of\nthe victims, so far as we knew, might be entirely innocent of enmity\ntoward us, or of the evil which had been done to our native planet. But\nthis was a case in which the good--if they existed--must suffer with the\nbad on account of the wicked deeds of the latter.\n\nI have already remarked that the continents of Mars were higher on their\nnorthern and southern borders where they faced the great oceans. These\nnatural barriers bore to the main mass of land somewhat the relation of\nthe edge of a shallow dish to its bottom. Their rise on the land side\nwas too gradual to give them the appearance of hills, but on the side\ntoward the sea they broke down in steep banks and cliffs several hundred\nfeet in height. We guessed that it would be in the direction of these\nelevations that the inhabitants would flee, and those who had timely\nwarning might thus be able to escape in case the flood did not--as it\nseemed possible it might in its first mad rush--overtop the highest\nelevations on Mars.\n\nAs day broke and the sun slowly rose upon the dreadful scene beneath us,\nwe began to catch sight of some of the fleeing inhabitants. We had\nshifted the position of the fleet toward the south, and were now\nsuspended above the southeastern corner of Aeria. Here a high bank of\nreddish rock confronted the sea, whose waters ran lashing and roaring\nalong the bluffs to supply the rapid drought produced by the emptying of\nSyrtis Major. Along the shore there was a narrow line of land, hundreds\nof miles in length, but less than a quarter of a mile broad, which still\nrose slightly above the surface of the water, and this land of refuge\nwas absolutely packed with the monstrous inhabitants of the planet who\nhad fled hither on the first warning that the water was coming.\n\nIn some places it was so crowded that the later comers could not find\nstanding ground on dry land, but were continually slipping back and\nfalling into the water. It was an awful sight to look at them. It\nreminded me of pictures I had seen of the deluge in the days of Noah,\nwhen the waters had risen to the mountain tops, and men, women and\nchildren were fighting for a foothold upon the last dry spots the earth\ncontained.\n\nWe were all moved by a desire to help our enemies, for we were\noverwhelmed with feelings of pity and remorse, but to aid them was now\nutterly beyond our power. The mighty floods were out, and the end was in\nthe hands of God.\n\nFortunately, we had little time for these thoughts, because no sooner\nhad the day begun to dawn around us than the airships of the Martians\nappeared. Evidently the people in them were dazed by the disaster and\nuncertain what to do. It is doubtful whether at first they comprehended\nthe fact that we were the agents who had produced the cataclysm.\n\nBut as the morning advanced the airships came flocking in greater and\ngreater numbers from every direction, many swooping down close to the\nflood in order to rescue those who were drowning. Hundreds gathered\nalong the slip of land which was crowded as I have described, with\nrefugees, while other hundreds rapidly assembled about us, evidently\npreparing for an attack.\n\nWe had learned in our previous contests with the airships of the\nMartians that our electrical ships had a great advantage over them, not\nmerely in rapidity and facility of movement, but in the fact that our\ndisintegrators could sweep in every direction, while it was only with\nmuch difficulty that the Martian airships could discharge their\nelectrical strokes at an enemy poised directly above their heads.\n\nAccordingly, orders were instantly flashed to all the squadrons to rise\nvertically to an elevation so great that the rarity of the atmosphere\nwould prevent the airships from attaining the same level.\n\nThis maneuver was executed so quickly that the Martians were unable to\ndeal us a blow before we were poised above them in such a position that\nthey could not easily reach us. Still they did not mean to give up the\nconflict.\n\nPresently we saw one of the largest of their ships maneuvering in a very\npeculiar manner, the purpose of which we did not at first comprehend.\nIts forward portion commenced slowly to rise, until it pointed upward\nlike the nose of a fish approaching the surface of the water. The moment\nit was in this position, an electrical bolt was darted from its prow,\nand one of our ships received a shock which, although it did not prove\nfatal to the vessel itself, killed two or three men aboard it,\ndisarranged its apparatus, and rendered it for the time being useless.\n\n\"Ah, that's their trick, is it?\" said Mr. Edison. \"We must look out for\nthat. Whenever you see one of the airships beginning to stick its nose\nup after that fashion blaze away at it.\"\n\nAn order to this effect was transmitted throughout the squadron. At the\nsame time several of the most powerful disintegrators were directed upon\nthe ship which had executed the stratagem and, reduced to a wreck, it\ndropped, whirling like a broken kite until it fell into the flood\nbeneath.\n\nStill the Martian ships came flocking in ever greater numbers from all\ndirections. They made desperate attempts to attain the level at which we\nhung above them. This was impossible, but many, getting an impetus by a\nswift run in the denser portion of the atmosphere beneath, succeeded in\nrising so high that they could discharge their electric artillery with\nconsiderable effect. Others, with more or less success, repeated the\nmaneuver of the ship which had first attacked us, and thus the battle\ngradually became more general and more fierce, until, in the course of\nan hour or two, our squadron found itself engaged with probably a\nthousand airships, which blazed with incessant lightning strokes, and\nwere able, all too frequently, to do us serious damage.\n\nBut on our part the battle was waged with a cool determination and a\nconsciousness of insuperable advantage which boded ill for the enemy.\nOnly three or four of our sixty electrical ships were seriously damaged,\nwhile the work of the disintegrators upon the crowded fleet that floated\nbeneath us was terrible to look upon.\n\nOur strokes fell thick and fast on all sides. It was like firing into a\nflock of birds that could not get away. Notwithstanding all their\nefforts they were practically at our mercy. Shattered into\nunrecognizable fragments, hundreds of the airships continually dropped\nfrom their great height to be swallowed up in the boiling waters.\n\nYet they were game to the last. They made every effort to get at us, and\nin their frenzy they seemed to discharge their bolts without much regard\nto whether friends or foes were injured. Our eyes were nearly blinded by\nthe ceaseless glare beneath us, and the uproar was indescribable.\n\nAt length, after this fearful contest had lasted for at least three\nhours, it became evident that the strength of the enemy was rapidly\nweakening. Nearly the whole of their immense fleet of airships had been\ndestroyed, or so far damaged that they were barely able to float. Just\nso long, however, as they showed signs of resistance we continued to\npour our merciless fire upon them, and the signal to cease was not given\nuntil the airships, which had escaped serious damage began to flee in\nevery direction.\n\n\"Thank God, the thing is over,\" said Mr. Edison. \"We have got the\nvictory at last, but how we shall make use of it is something that at\npresent I do not see.\"\n\n\"But will they not renew the attack?\" asked someone.\n\n\"I do not think they can,\" was the reply. \"We have destroyed the very\nflower of their fleet.\"\n\n\"And better than that,\" said Colonel Smith, \"we have destroyed their\nclan; we have made them afraid. Their discipline is gone.\"\n\nBut this was only the beginning of our victory. The floods below were\nachieving a still greater triumph, and now that we had conquered the\nairships we dropped within a few hundred feet of the surface of the\nwater and then turned our faces westward in order to follow the advance\nof the deluge and see whether, as we hoped, it would overwhelm our\nenemies in the very center of their power.\n\nIn a little while we had overtaken the first wave, which was still\ndevouring everything. We saw it bursting the banks of the canal,\nsweeping away forests of gigantic trees, and swallowing cities and\nvillages, leaving nothing but a broad expanse of swirling and eddying\nwaters, which, in consequence of the prevailing red hue of the\nvegetation and the soil, looked, as shuddering we gazed down upon it,\nlike an ocean of blood flecked with foam and steaming with the escaping\nlife of the planet from whose veins it gushed.\n\nAs we skirted the southern borders of the continent the same dreadful\nscenes which we had beheld on the coast of Aeria presented themselves.\nCrowds of refugees thronged the high borders of the land and struggled\nwith one another for a foothold against the continually rising flood.\n\nWe saw, too, flitting in every direction, but rapidly fleeing before our\napproach, many airships, evidently crowded with Martians, but not armed\neither for offense or defense. These, of course, we did not disturb, for\nmerciless as our proceedings seemed even to ourselves, we had no\nintention of making war upon the innocent, or upon those who had no\nmeans to resist. What we had done it had seemed to us necessary to do,\nbut henceforth we were resolved to take no more lives if it could be\navoided.\n\nThus, during the remainder of that day, all of the following night and\nall of the next day, we continued upon the heels of the advancing flood.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\n\n_THE WOMAN FROM CERES_\n\n\nThe second night we could perceive ahead of us the electric lights\ncovering the land of Thaumasia, in the midst of which lay the Lake of\nthe Sun. The flood would be upon it by daybreak, and, assuming that the\ndemoralization produced by the news of the coming of the waters, which\nwe were aware had hours before been flashed to the capitol of Mars,\nwould prevent the Martians from effectively manning their forts, we\nthought it safe to hasten on with the flagship, and one or two others,\nin advance of the waters, and to hover over the Lake of the Sun, in the\ndarkness, in order that we might watch the deluge perform its awful work\nin the morning.\n\nThaumasia, as we have before remarked, was a broad, oval-shaped land,\nabout 1,800 miles across, having the Lake of the Sun exactly in its\ncenter. From this lake, which was four or five hundred miles in\ndiameter, and circular in outline, many canals radiated, as straight as\nthe spokes of a wheel, in every direction, and connected it with the\nsurrounding seas.\n\nLike all the other Martian continents, Thaumasia lay below the level of\nthe sea, except toward the south, where it fronted the ocean.\n\nCompletely surrounding the lake was a great ring of cities constituting\nthe capitol of Mars. Here the genius of the Martians had displayed\nitself to the full. The surrounding country was irrigated until it\nfairly bloomed with gigantic vegetation and flowers; the canals were\ncarefully regulated with locks so that the supply of water was under\ncomplete control; the display of magnificent metallic buildings of all\nkinds and sizes produced a most dazzling effect, and the protection\nagainst enemies afforded by the innumerable fortifications surrounding\nthe ringed city, and guarding the neighboring lands, seemed complete.\n\nSuspended at a height of perhaps two miles from the surface, near the\nsouthern edge of the lake, we waited for the oncoming flood. With the\ndawn of day we began to perceive more clearly the effects which the news\nof the drowning of the planet had produced. It was evident that many of\nthe inhabitants of the cities had already fled. Airships on which the\nfugitives hung as thick as swarms of bees were seen, elevated but a\nshort distance above the ground, and making their way rapidly toward the\nsouth.\n\nThe Martians knew that their only hope of escape lay in reaching the\nhigh southern border of the land before the floods were upon them. But\nthey must have known also that that narrow beach would not suffice to\ncontain one in ten of those who sought refuge there. The density of the\npopulation around the Lake of the Sun seemed to us incredible. Again our\nhearts sank within us at the sight of the fearful destruction of life\nfor which we were responsible. Yet we comforted ourselves with the\nreflection that it was unavoidable. As Colonel Smith put it:\n\n\"You couldn't trust these coyotes. The only thing to do was to drown\nthem out. I am sorry for them, but I guess there will be as many left as\nwill be good for us, anyhow.\"\n\nWe had not long to wait for the flood. As the dawn began to streak the\neast, we saw its awful crest moving out of the darkness, bursting across\nthe canals and plowing its way into the direction of the crowded shores\nof the Lake of the Sun. The supply of water behind that great wave\nseemed inexhaustible. Five thousand miles it had traveled, and yet its\npower was as great as when it started from the Syrtis Major.\n\nWe caught sight of the oncoming water before it was visible to the\nMartians beneath us. But while it was yet many miles away, the roar of\nit reached them, and then arose a chorus of terrified cries, the effect\nof which, coming to our ears out of the half gloom of the morning, was\nmost uncanny and horrible. Thousands upon thousands of the Martians\nstill remained here to become victims of the deluge. Some, perhaps, had\ndoubted the truth of the reports that the banks were down and the floods\nwere out; others, for one reason or another had been unable to get away;\nothers, like the inhabitants of Pompeii, had lingered too long, or had\nreturned after beginning their flight to secure abandoned treasures, and\nnow it was too late to get away.\n\nWith a roar that shook the planet the white wall rushed upon the great\ncity beneath our feet, and in an instant it had been engulfed. On went\nthe flood, swallowing up the Lake of the Sun itself, and in a little\nwhile, as far as our eyes could range, the land of Thaumasia had been\nturned into a raging sea.\n\nWe now turned our ships toward the southern border of the land,\nfollowing the direction of the airships carrying the fugitives, a few of\nwhich were still navigating the atmosphere a mile beneath us. In their\nexcitement and terror the Martians paid little attention to us,\nalthough, as the morning brightened, they must have been aware of our\npresence over their heads. But, apparently, they no longer thought of\nresistance; their only object was escape from the immediate and\nappalling danger.\n\nWhen we had progressed to a point about half way from the Lake of the\nSun to the border of the sea, having dropped down within a few hundred\nfeet of the surface, there suddenly appeared, in the midst of the raging\nwaters, a sight so remarkable that at first I rubbed my eyes in\nastonishment, not crediting their report of what they beheld.\n\nStanding on the apex of a sandy elevation, which still rose a few feet\nabove the gathering flood, was a figure of a woman, as perfect in form\nand in classic beauty of feature as the Venus of Milo--a magnified human\nbeing not less than forty feet in height!\n\nBut for her swaying and the wild motions of her arms, we should have\nmistaken her for a marble statue.\n\nAina, who happened to be looking, instantly exclaimed:\n\n\"It is the woman from Ceres. She was taken prisoner by the Martians\nduring their last invasion of that world, and since then has been a\nslave in the palace of the emperor.\"\n\nApparently her great stature had enabled her to escape, while her\nmasters had been drowned. She had fled like the others, toward the\nsouth, but being finally surrounded by the rising waters, had taken\nrefuge on the hillock of sand, where we saw her. This was fast giving\nway under the assault of the waves, and even while we watched the water\nrose to her knees.\n\n\"Drop lower,\" was the order of the electrical steersman of the flagship,\nand as quickly as possible we approached the place where the towering\nfigure stood.\n\nShe had realized the hopelessness of her situation, and quickly ceased\nthose appalling and despairing gestures, which had at first served to\nconvince us that it was indeed a living being on whom we were looking.\n\nThere she stood, with a light, white garment thrown about her, erect,\nhalf-defiant, half yielding to her fear, more graceful than any Greek\nstatue, her arms outstretched, yet motionless, and her eyes upcast, as\nif praying to her God to protect her. Her hair, which shone like gold in\nthe increasing light of day, streamed over her shoulders, and her great\neyes were astare between terror and supplication. So wildly beautiful a\nsight not one of us had ever beheld.\n\nFor a moment sympathy was absorbed in admiration. Then:\n\n\"Save her! Save her!\" was the cry that arose throughout the ship.\n\nRopes were instantly thrown out, and one or two men prepared to let\nthemselves down in order better to aid her.\n\nBut when we were almost within reach, and so close that we could see the\nvery expression of her eyes, which appeared to take no note of us, but\nto be fixed, with a far away look upon something beyond human ken,\nsuddenly the undermined bank on which she stood gave way, the blood red\nflood swirled in from right to left, and then:\n\n    \"The waters closed above her face\n    With many a ring.\"\n\n\"If but for that woman's sake, I am sorry we drowned the planet,\"\nexclaimed Sydney Phillips. But a moment afterward I saw that he\nregretted what he had said, for Aina's eyes were fixed upon him.\nPerhaps, however, she did not understand his remark, and perhaps if she\ndid it gave her no offence.\n\nAfter this episode we pursued our way rapidly until we arrived at the\nshore of the Southern Ocean. There, as we had expected, was to be seen a\nnarrow strip of land with the ocean on one side and the raging flood\nseeking to destroy it on the other. In some places it had already broken\nthrough, so that the ocean was flowing in to assist in the drowning of\nThaumasia.\n\nBut some parts of the coast were evidently so elevated that no matter\nhow high the flood might rise it would not completely cover them. Here\nthe fugitives had gathered in dense throngs and above them hovered most\nof the airships, loaded down with others who were unable to find room\nupon the dry land.\n\nOn one of the loftiest and broadest of these elevations we noticed\nindications of military order in the alignment of the crowds and the\nshore all around was guarded by gigantic pickets, who mercilessly shoved\nback into the flood all the later comers, and thus prevented too great\ncrowding upon the land. In the center of this elevation rose a palatial\nstructure of red metal which Aina informed us was one of the residences\nof the Emperor, and we concluded that the monarch himself was now\npresent there.\n\nThe absence of any signs of resistance on the part of the airships, and\nthe complete drowning of all of the formidable fortifications on the\nsurface of the planet, convinced us that all we had to do in order to\ncomplete our conquest was to get possession of the person of the chief\nruler.\n\nThe fleet was, accordingly, concentrated, and we rapidly approached the\ngreat Martian palace. As we came down within a hundred feet of them and\nboldly made our way among their airships, which retreated at our\napproach, the Martians gazed at us with mingled fear and astonishment.\n\nWe were their conquerors and they knew it. We were coming to demand\ntheir surrender, and they evidently understood that also. As we\napproached the palace signals were made from it with brilliant colored\nbanners which Aina informed us were intended as a token of truce.\n\n\"We shall have to go down and have a confab with them, I suppose,\" said\nMr. Edison. \"We can't kill them off now that they are helpless, but we\nmust manage somehow to make them understand that unconditional surrender\nis their only chance.\"\n\n\"Let us take Aina with us,\" I suggested, \"and since she can speak the\nlanguage of the Martians we shall probably have no difficulty in\narriving at an understanding.\"\n\nAccordingly the flagship was carefully brought further down in front of\nthe entrance to the palace, which had been kept clear by the Martian\nguards, and while the remainder of the squadron assembled within a few\nfeet directly over our heads with the disintegrators turned upon the\npalace and the crowd below, Mr. Edison and myself, accompanied by Aina,\nstepped out upon the ground.\n\nThere was a forward movement in the immense crowd, but the guards\nsternly kept everybody back. A party of a dozen giants, preceded by one\nwho seemed to be their commander, gorgeously attired in jewelled\ngarments, advanced from the entrance of the palace to meet us. Aina\naddressed a few words to the leader, who replied sternly, and then,\nbeckoning us to follow, retraced his steps into the palace.\n\nNotwithstanding our confidence that all resistance had ceased, we did\nnot deem it wise actually to venture into the lion's den without having\ntaken every precaution against a surprise. Accordingly, before following\nthe Martian into the palace, we had twenty of the electrical ships\nmoored around it in such a position that they commanded not only the\nentrance but all of the principal windows, and then a party of forty\npicked men, each doubly armed with powerful disintegrators, were\nselected to attend us into the building. This party was placed under the\ncommand of Colonel Smith, and Sydney Phillips insisted on being a member\nof it.\n\nIn the meantime the Martian with his attendants who had first invited us\nto enter, finding that we did not follow him, had returned to the front\nof the palace. He saw the disposition that we had made of our forces,\nand instantly comprehended its significance, for his manner changed\nsomewhat, and he seemed more desirous than before to conciliate us.\n\nWhen he again beckoned us to enter, we unhesitatingly followed him, and\npassing through the magnificent entrance, found ourselves in a vast\nante-chamber, adorned after the manner of the Martians in the most\nexpensive manner. Thence we passed into a great circular apartment, with\na dome painted in imitation of the sky, and so lofty that to our eyes it\nseemed like the firmament itself. Here we found ourselves approaching an\nelevated throne situated in the center of the apartment, while long rows\nof brilliantly armored guards flanked us on either side, and grouped\naround the throne, some standing and others reclining upon the flights\nof steps which appeared to be of solid gold, was an array of Martian\nwoman, beautifully and becomingly attired, all of whom greatly\nastonished us by the singular charm of their faces and bearing, so\ndifferent from the aspect of most of the Martians whom we had\nencountered.\n\nDespite their stature--for these women averaged twelve or thirteen feet\nin height--the beauty of their complexions--of a dark olive tint--was no\nless brilliant than that of the women of Italy or Spain.\n\nAt the top of the steps on a magnificent golden throne, sat the Emperor\nhimself. There are some busts of Caracalla which I have seen that are\nalmost as ugly as the face of the Martian ruler. He was of gigantic\nstature, larger than the majority of his subjects, and as near as I\ncould judge must have been between fifteen and sixteen feet in height.\n\nAs I looked at him I understood a remark which had been made by Aina to\nthe effect that the Martians were not all alike, and that the\npeculiarities of their minds were imprinted on their faces and expressed\nin their forms in a very wonderful, and sometimes terrible manner.\n\nI had also learned from her that Mars was under a military government,\nand that the military class had absolute control of the planet. I was\nsomewhat startled, then, in looking at the head and center of the great\nmilitary system of Mars, to find in his appearance a striking\nconformation of the speculations of our terrestrial phrenologists. His\nbroad, mis-shapen head bulged in those parts where they had placed the\nso-called organs of combativeness, destructiveness, etc.\n\nPlainly, this was an effect of his training and education. His very\nbrain had become a military engine; and the aspect of his face, the\npitiless lines of his mouth and chin, the evil glare of his eyes, the\nattitude and carriage of his muscular body, all tended to complete the\nwarlike ensemble.\n\nHe was magnificently dressed in some vesture that had the luster of a\npolished plate of gold, and the suppleness of velvet. As we approached\nhe fixed his immense, deep-set eyes sternly upon our faces.\n\nThe contrast between his truly terrible countenance and the Eve-like\nfeatures of the women which surrounded his throne was as great as if\nSatan after his fall had here re-enthroned himself in the midst of\nangels.\n\nMr. Edison, Colonel Smith, Sydney Phillips, Aina and myself advanced at\nthe head of the procession, our guard following in close order behind\nus. It had been evident from the moment that we entered the palace that\nAina was regarded with aversion by all of the Martians. Even the women\nabout the throne gazed scowlingly at her as we drew near. Apparently,\nthe bitterness of feeing which had led to the massacre of all of her\nrace had not yet vanished. And, indeed, since the fact that she remained\nalive could have been known only to the Martian who had abducted her and\nto his immediate companions, her reappearance with us must have been a\ngreat surprise to all those who now looked upon her.\n\nIt was clear to me that the feeling aroused by her appearance was every\nmoment becoming more intense. Still, the thought of a violent outbreak\ndid not occur to me, because our recent triumph had seemed so complete\nthat I believed the Martians would be awed by our presence, and would\nnot undertake actually to injure the girl.\n\nI think we all had the same impression, but as the event proved, we were\nmistaken.\n\nSuddenly one of the gigantic guards, as if actuated by a fit of\nungovernable hatred, lifted his foot and kicked Aina. With a loud shriek\nshe fell to the floor.\n\nThe blow was so unexpected that for a second we all stood riveted to the\nspot. Then I saw Colonel Smith's face turn livid, and at the same\ninstant heard the whirr of his disintegrator, while Sydney Phillips,\nforgetting the deadly instrument he carried in his hand, sprung madly\ntoward the brute who had kicked Aina, as if he intended to throttle him,\ncolossus that he was.\n\nBut Colonel Smith's aim, though instantaneously taken, as he had been\naccustomed to shoot on the plains, was true, and Phillips, plunging\nmadly forward, seemed wreathed in a faint blue mist--all that the\ndisintegrator had left of the gigantic Martian.\n\nWho could adequately describe the scene that followed?\n\nI remember that the Martian emperor sprang to his feet, looking tenfold\nmore terrible than before. I remember that there instantly burst from\nthe line of guards on either side crinkling beams of death-fire that\nseemed to sear the eyeballs. I saw a half a dozen of our men fall in\nheaps of ashes, and even at that terrible moment I had time to wonder\nthat a single one of us remained alive.\n\nRather by instinct than in consequence of any order given, we formed\nourselves in a hollow square, with Aina lying apparently lifeless in the\ncenter, and then with gritted teeth we did our work.\n\nThe lines of guards melted before the disintegrators like rows of snow\nmen before a licking flame.\n\nThe discharge of the lightning engines in the hands of the Martians in\nthat confined space made an uproar so tremendous that it seemed to pass\nthe bounds of human sense.\n\nMore of our men fell before their awful fire, and for the second time\nsince our arrival on this deadful planet of war our annihilation seemed\ninevitable.\n\nBut in a moment the whole scene changed. Suddenly there was a discharge\ninto the room which I knew came from one of the disintegrators of the\nelectrical ships. It swept through the crowded throng like a destroying\nblast. Instantly from another side, swished a second discharge, no less\ndestructive, and this was quickly followed by a third.\n\nOur ships were firing through the windows.\n\nAlmost at the same moment I saw the flagship, which had been moored in\nthe air close to the entrance and floating only three or four feet above\nthe ground, pushing its way through the gigantic doorway from the\nante-room, with its great disintegrators pointed upon the crowd like the\nmuzzles of a cruiser's guns.\n\nAnd now the Martians saw that the contest was hopeless for them, and\ntheir mad struggle to get out of the range of the disintegrators and to\nescape from the death chamber was more appalling to look upon than\nanything that had yet occurred.\n\n[Illustration: _\"Suddenly there was a discharge into the room which I\nknew came from one of the disintegrators of the electrical ships. It\nswept through the crowded throng like a destroying blast. It was a panic\nof giants!\"_]\n\nIt was a panic of giants. They trod one another under foot; they yelled\nand screamed in their terror; they tore each other with their claw-like\nfingers. They no longer thought of resistance. The battle spirit had\nbeen blown out of them by a breath of terror that shivered their marrow.\n\nStill the pitiless disintegrators played upon them until Mr. Edison,\nmaking himself heard, now that the thunder of their engines had ceased\nto reverberate through the chamber, commanded that our fire should\ncease.\n\nIn the meantime the armed Martians outside the palace, hearing the\nuproar within, seeing our men pouring their fire through the windows,\nand supposing that we were guilty at once of treachery and\nassassination, had attempted an attack upon the electrical ships\nstationed round the building. But fortunately they had none of their\nlarger engines at hand, and with their hand arms alone they had not been\nable to stand up against the disintegrators. They were blown away before\nthe withering fire of the ships by the hundreds until, fleeing from\ndestruction, they rushed madly, driving their unarmed companions before\nthem into the seething waters of the flood close at hand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n\n_THE FEARFUL OATHS OF COLONEL SMITH_\n\n\nThrough all this terrible contest the emperor of the Martians had\nremained standing upon his throne, gazing at the awful spectacle, and\nnot moving from the spot. Neither he nor the frightened woman gathered\nupon the steps of the throne had been injured by the disintegrators.\nTheir immunity was due to the fact that the position and elevation of\nthe throne were such that, it was not within the range of fire of the\nelectrical ships which had poured their vibratory discharges through the\nwindows, and we inside had only directed our fire toward the warriors\nwho had attacked us.\n\nNow that the struggle was over we turned our attention to Aina.\nFortunately the girl had not been seriously injured and she was quickly\nrestored to consciousness. Had she been killed, we would have been\npractically helpless in attempting further negotiations, because the\nknowledge which we had acquired of the language of the Martians from the\nprisoner captured on the golden asteroid, was not sufficient to meet the\nrequirements of the occasion.\n\nWhen the Martian monarch saw that we ceased the work of death, he sank\nupon his throne. There he remained, leaning his chin upon his two hands\nand staring straight before him like that terrible doomed creature who\nfascinates the eyes of every beholder standing in the Sistine Chapel and\ngazing at Micheal Angeleo's dreadful painting of \"The Last Judgement.\"\n\nThis wicked Martian also felt that he was in the grasp of pitiless and\nirresistible fate, and that a punishment too well deserved, and from\nwhich there was no possible escape, now confronted him.\n\nThere he remained in a hopelessness which almost compelled our sympathy,\nuntil Aina had so far recovered that she was once more able to act as\nour interpreter. Then we made short work of the negotiations. Speaking\nthrough Aina, the commander said:\n\n\"You know who we are. We have come from the earth, which, by your\ncommand, was laid waste. Our commission was not revenge, but\nself-protection. What we have done has been accomplished with that in\nview. You have just witnessed an example of our power, the exercise of\nwhich was not dictated by our wish, but compelled by the attack wantonly\nmade upon a helpless member of our own race under our protection.\n\n\"We have laid waste your planet, but it is simply a just retribution for\nwhat you did with ours. We are prepared to complete the destruction,\nleaving not a living being in this world of yours, or to grant you\npeace, at your choice. Our condition of peace is simply this: All\nresistance must cease absolutely.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" broke in Colonel Smith; \"let the scorpion pull out his\nsting or we shall do it for him.\"\n\n\"Nothing that we could do now,\" continued the commander, \"would in my\nopinion save you from ultimate destruction. The forces of nature which\nwe have been compelled to let loose upon you will complete their own\nvictory. But we do not wish, unnecessarily, to stain our hands further\nwith your blood. We shall leave you in possession of your lives.\nPreserve them if you can. But, in case the flood recedes before you have\nall perished from starvation, remember that you here take an oath,\nsolemnly binding yourself and your descendants forever never again to\nmake war upon the earth.\"\n\n\"That's really the best we can do,\" said Mr. Edison, turning to us. \"We\ncan't possibly murder these people in cold blood. The probability is\nthat the flood has hopelessly ruined all their engines of war. I do not\nbelieve that there is one chance in ten that the waters will drain off\nin time to enable them to get at their stores of provisions before they\nhave perished from starvation.\"\n\n\"It is my opinion,\" said Lord Kelvin, who had joined us (his pair of\ndisintegrators hanging by his side, attached to a strap running over the\nback of his neck, very much as a farmer sometimes carries his big\nmittens), \"it is my opinion that the flood will recede more rapidly than\nyou think, and that the majority of these people will survive. But I\nquite agree with your merciful view of the matter. We must be guilty of\nno wanton destruction. Probably more than nine-tenths of the inhabitants\nof Mars have perished in the deluge. Even if all the others survived\nages would elapse before they could regain the power to injure us.\"\n\nI need not describe in detail how our propositions were received by the\nMartian monarch. He knew, and his advisors, some of whom he had called\nin consultation, also knew, that everything was in our hands to do as we\npleased. They readily agreed, therefore, that they would make no more\nresistance and that we and our electrical ships should be undisturbed\nwhile we remained upon Mars. The monarch took the oath prescribed after\nthe manner of his race; thus the business was completed. But through it\nall there had been a shadow of a sneer on the emperor's face which I did\nnot like. But I said nothing.\n\nAnd now we began to think of our return home, and of the pleasure we\nshould have in recounting our adventures to our friends on the earth,\nwho undoubtedly were eagerly awaiting news from us. We knew that they\nhad been watching Mars with powerful telescopes, and we were also eager\nto learn how much they had seen and how much they had been able to guess\nof our proceedings.\n\nBut a day or two at least would be required to overhaul the electrical\nships and examine the state of our provisions. Those which we had\nbrought from the earth, it will be remembered, had been spoiled and we\nhad been compelled to replace them from the compressed provisions found\nin the Martian's storehouse. This compressed food had proved not only\nexceedingly agreeable to the taste, but very nourishing, and all of us\nhad grown extremely fond of it. A new supply, however, would be needed\nin order to carry us back to the earth. At least sixty days would be\nrequired for the homeward journey, because we could hardly expect to\nstart from Mars with the same initial velocity which we had been able to\ngenerate on leaving home.\n\nIn considering the matter of provisioning the fleet it finally became\nnecessary to take an account of our losses. This was a thing that we had\nall shrunk from, because they had seemed to us almost too terrible to be\nborne. But now the facts had to be faced. Out of the one hundred ships,\ncarrying something more than two thousand souls, with which we had\nquitted the earth, there remained only fifty-five ships and 1085 men!\nAll the others had been lost in our terrible encounters with the\nMartians, and particularly in our first disastrous battle beneath the\nclouds.\n\nAmong the lost were many men whose names were famous upon the earth, and\nwhose death would be widely deplored when the news of it was received\nupon their native planet. Fortunately this number did not include any of\nthose whom I have had occasion to mention in the course of this\nnarrative. The venerable Lord Kelvin, who, notwithstanding his age, and\nhis pacific disposition, proper to a man of science, had behaved with\nthe courage and coolness of a veteran in every crisis; Monsieur Moissan,\nthe eminent chemist; Professor Sylvanus P. Thompson, and the Heidelberg\nprofessor, to whom we all felt under special obligations because he had\nopened to our comprehension the charming lips of Aina--all these had\nsurvived, and were about to return with us to the earth.\n\nIt seemed to some of us almost heartless to deprive the Martians who\nstill remained alive of any of the provisions which they themselves\nwould require to tide them over the long period which must elapse before\nthe recession of the flood should enable them to discover the sites of\ntheir ruined homes, and to find the means of sustenance. But necessity\nwas now our only law. We learned from Aina that there must be stores of\nprovisions in the neighborhood of the palace, because it was the custom\nof the Martians to lay up such stores during the harvest time in each\nMartian year in order to provide against the contingency of an\nextraordinary drought.\n\nIt was not with very good grace that the Martian emperor acceded to our\ndemands that one of the storehouses should be opened, but resistance was\nuseless and of course we had our way.\n\nThe supplies of water which we brought from the earth, owing to a\npeculiar process invented by Monsieur Moissan, had been kept in\nexceedingly good condition, but they were now running low and it became\nnecessary to replenish them also. This was easily done from the Southern\nOcean, for on Mars, since the levelling of the continental elevations,\nbrought about many years ago, there is comparatively little salinity in\nthe sea waters.\n\nWhile these preparations were going on Lord Kelvin and the other men of\nscience entered with the utmost eagerness upon those studies, the\nprosecution of which had been the principal inducement leading them to\nembark on the expedition. But, almost all of the face of the planet\nbeing covered with the flood, there was comparatively little that they\ncould do. Much, however, could be learned with the aid of Aina from the\nMartians, now crowded on the land above the palace.\n\nThe results of these discoveries will in due time appear, fully\nelaborated in learned and authoratative treatises prepared by these\nsavants' themselves. I shall only call attention to one, which seemed to\nme very remarkable. I have already said that there were astonishing\ndifferences in the personal appearance of the Martians evidently arising\nfrom differences of character and education, which had impressed\nthemselves in the physical aspect of the individuals. We now learned\nthat these differences were more completely the result of education than\nwe had at first supposed.\n\nLooking about among the Martians by whom we were surrounded, it soon\nbecame easy for us to tell who were the soldiers and who were the\ncivilians, simply by the appearance of their bodies, and particularly of\ntheir heads. All members of the military class resembled, to a greater\nor less extent, the monarch himself, in that those parts of their skulls\nwhich our phrenologists had designated as the bumps of destructiveness,\ncombativeness and so on were enormously and disproportionately\ndeveloped.\n\nAnd all this, we were assured, was completely under the control of the\nMartians themselves. They had learned, or invented, methods by which the\nbrain itself could be manipulated, so to speak, and any desired portions\nof it could be especially developed, while other parts of it were left\nto their normal growth. The consequence was that in the Martian schools\nand colleges there was no teaching in our sense of the word. It was all\nbrain culture.\n\nA Martian youth selected to be a soldier had his fighting faculties\nespecially developed, together with those parts of the brain which\nimpart courage and steadiness of nerve. He who was intended for\nscientific investigation had his brain developed into a mathematical\nmachine, or an instrument of observation. Poets and literary men had\ntheir heads bulging with the imaginative faculties. The heads of the\ninventors were developed into a still different shape.\n\n\"And so,\" said Aina, translating for us the words of a professor in the\nImperial University of Mars, from whom we derived the greater part of\nour information on this subject, \"the Martian boys do not study a\nsubject; they do not have to learn it, but, when their brains have been\nsufficiently developed in the proper direction, they comprehend it\ninstantly, by a kind of divine instinct.\"\n\nBut among the women of Mars, we saw none of these curious, and to our\neyes, monstrous differences of development. While the men received, in\naddition to their special education, a broad general culture also, with\nthe women there was no special education. It was all general in its\ncharacter, yet thorough enough in that way. The consequence was that\nonly female brains upon Mars were entirely well balanced. This was the\nreason why we invariably found the Martian women to be remarkably\ncharming creatures, with none of those physical exaggerations and\nuncouth developments which disfigured their masculine companions.\n\nAll the books of the Martians, we ascertained, were books of history and\nof poetry. For scientific treatises they had no need, because, as I have\nexplained, when the brains of those intended for scientific pursuits had\nbeen developed in the proper way the knowledge of nature's laws came to\nthem without effort, as a spring bubbles from the rocks.\n\nOne word of explanation may be needed concerning the failure of the\nMartians, with all their marvelous powers, to invent electrical ships\nlike those of Mr. Edison's and engines of destruction comparable with\nour disintegrators. This failure was simply due to the fact that on Mars\nthere did not exist the peculiar metals by the combination of which Mr.\nEdison had been able to effect his wonders. The theory involved by our\ninventions was perfectly understood by them and had they possessed the\nmeans, doubtless they would have been able to carry it into practice\neven more effectively than we had done.\n\nAfter two or three days all the preparations having been completed the\nsignal was given for our departure. The men of science were still\nunwilling to leave this strange world, but Mr. Edison decided we could\nlinger no longer.\n\nAt the moment of starting a most tragic event occured. Our fleet was\nassembled around the palace, and the signal was given to rise slowly to\na considerable height before imparting a great velocity to the\nelectrical ships. As we slowly rose we saw the immense crowd of giants\nbeneath us, with upturned faces, watching our departure. The Martian\nmonarch and all his suite had come out upon the terrace of the palace to\nlook at us. At a moment when he probably supposed himself to be\nunwatched he shook his fist at the retreating fleet. My eyes and those\nof several others in the flagship chanced to be fixed upon him. Just as\nhe made the gesture one of the women of his suite, in her eagerness to\nwatch us, apparently lost her balance and stumbled against him. Without\na moment's hesitation, with a tremendous blow, he felled her like an ox\nat his feet.\n\nA fearful oath broke from the lips of Colonel Smith, who was one of\nthose looking on. It chanced that he stood near the principal\ndisintegrator of the flagship. Before anybody could interfere he had\nsighted and discharged it. The entire force of the terrible engine,\nalmost capable of destroying a fort, fell upon the Martian emperor and\nnot merely blew him into a cloud of atoms but opened a great cavity in\nthe ground on the spot where he had stood.\n\nA shout arose from the Martians, but they were too much astounded at\nwhat had occurred to make any hostile demonstrations, and, anyhow, they\nknew well that they were completely at our mercy.\n\nMr. Edison was on the point of rebuking Colonel Smith for what he had\ndone, but Aina interposed.\n\n\"I am glad it was done,\" said she \"for now only can you be safe. That\nmonster was more directly responsible than any other inhabitant of Mars\nfor all the wickedness of which they have been guilty.\n\n\"The expedition against the earth was inspired solely by him. There is a\ntradition among the Martians--which my people, however, could never\ncredit--that he possessed a kind of immortality. They declared that it\nwas he who led the former expedition against the earth when my ancestors\nwere brought away prisoners from their happy home, and that it was his\nimage which they had set up in stone in the midst of the Land of Sand.\nHe prolonged his existence, according to this legend, by drinking the\nwaters of a wonderful fountain, the secret of whose precise location was\nknown to him alone but which was situated at that point where in your\nmaps of Mars the name of the Fons Juventae occurs. He was personified\nwickedness, that I know; and he never would have kept his oath if power\nhad returned to him again to injure the earth. In destroying him, you\nhave made your victory secure.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n\n_THE GREAT OVATION_\n\n\nWhen at length we once more saw our native planet, with its\nwell-remembered features of land and sea, rolling beneath our eyes, the\nfeeling of joy that came over us transcended all powers of expression.\n\nIn order that all the nations which had united in sending out the\nexpedition should have visual evidence of its triumphal return, it was\ndecided to make the entire circuit of the earth before seeking our\nstarting point and disembarking. Brief accounts in all known languages,\ntelling the story of what we had done was accordingly prepared, and then\nwe dropped down through the air until again we saw the well-loved blue\ndome over our heads, and found ourselves suspended directly above the\nwhite topped cone of Fujiyama, the sacred mountain of Japan. Shifting\nour position toward the northeast, we hung above the city of Tokyo and\ndropped down into the crowds which had assembled to watch us, the\nprepared accounts of our journey, which, the moment they had been read\nand comprehended, led to such an outburst of rejoicing as it would be\nquite impossible to describe.\n\nOne of the ships containing the Japanese members of the expedition,\ndropped to the ground, and we left them in the midst of their rejoicing\ncountrymen. Before we started--and we remained but a short time\nsuspended above the Japanese capitol--millions had assembled to greet us\nwith their cheers.\n\nWe now repeated what we had done during our first examination of the\nsurface of Mars. We simply remained suspended in the atmosphere,\nallowing the earth to turn beneath us. As Japan receded in the distance\nwe found China beginning to appear. Shifting our position a little\ntoward the south, we again came to rest over the city of Pekin, where\nonce more we parted with some of our companions, and where the outburst\nof universal rejoicing was repeated.\n\nFrom Asia, crossing the Caspian Sea, we passed over Russia, visiting in\nturn Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\nStill the great globe rolled steadily beneath, and still we kept the sun\nwith us. Now Germany appeared, and now Italy, and then France, and\nEngland, as we shifted our position, first north then south, in order to\ngive all the world the opportunity to see that its warriors had returned\nvictorious from its far conquest. And in each country as it passed\nbeneath our feet, we left some of the comrades who had shared our perils\nand our adventures.\n\nAt length the Atlantic had rolled away under us, and we saw the spires\nof the new New York.\n\nThe news of our coming had been flashed ahead from Europe and our\ncountrymen were prepared to welcome us. We had originally started, it\nwill be remembered, at midnight, and now again as we approached the new\ncapitol of the world the curtain of night was just beginning to be drawn\nover it. But our signal lights were ablaze, and through these they were\naware of our approach.\n\nAgain the air was filled with bursting rockets and shaken with the roar\nof cannon, and with volleying cheers, poured from millions of throats,\nas we came to rest directly above the city.\n\nThree days after the landing of the fleet, and when the first enthusiasm\nof our reception had a little passed, I received a beautifully engraved\ncard inviting me to be present in Trinity Church at the wedding of Aina\nand Sydney Phillips.\n\nWhen I arrived at the church, which had been splendidly decorated, I\nfound there Mr. Edison, Lord Kelvin, and all the other members of the\ncrew of the flagship, and, considerably to my surprise, Colonel Smith,\nappropriately attired, and with a grace for the possession of which I\nhad not given him credit, gave away the beautiful bride.\n\nBut Alonzo Jefferson Smith was a man and a soldier, every inch of him.\n\n\"I asked her for myself,\" he whispered to me after the ceremony,\nswallowing a great lump in his throat, \"but she has had the desire of\nher heart. I am going back to the plains. I can get a command again, and\nI still know how to fight.\"\n\nAnd thus was united, for all future time, the first stem of the Aryan\nrace, which had been long lost, but not destroyed, with the latest\noffspring of that great family, and the link which had served to bring\nthem together was the far-away planet of Mars.\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n_BIBLIOGRAPHY OF GARRETT PUTMAN SERVISS_\n\nCompiled by Elizabeth Dew Searles\n\n\n_Non-Fiction: Magazine Articles_\n\n    Achievements of astronomical photography.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
