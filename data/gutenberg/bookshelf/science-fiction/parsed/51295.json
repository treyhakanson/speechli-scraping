L. WALLACE\n\n                         Illustrated by ASHMAN\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                Galaxy Science Fiction September 1954.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n              There is nothing at all like having a sound\n             mind in a sound body, but Dan Merrol had too\n             much of one--and also too much of the other!\n\n\n\"Sorry, darling,\" said Erica. She yawned, added, \"I've tried--but I\njust can't believe you're my husband.\"\n\nHe felt his own yawn slip off his face. \"What do you mean? What am I\ndoing here then?\"\n\n\"Can't you remember?\" Her laughter tinkled as she pushed him away and\nsat up. \"They said you were Dan Merrol at the hospital, but they must\nhave been wrong.\"\n\n\"Hospitals don't make that kind of mistake,\" he said with a certainty\nhe didn't altogether feel.\n\n\"But _I_ should know, shouldn't I?\"\n\n\"Of course, but....\" He did some verbal backstepping. \"It was a\nbad accident. You've got to expect that I won't be quite the same\nat first.\" He sat up. \"_Look_ at me. Can't you tell who I am?\" She\nreturned his gaze, then swayed toward him. He decided that she was\nhighly attractive--but surely he ought to have known that long ago.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith a visible effort she leaned away from him. \"Your left eye does\nlook familiar,\" she said cautiously. \"The brown one, I mean.\"\n\n\"The _brown_ one?\"\n\n\"Your other eye's green,\" she told him.\n\n\"Of course--a replacement. I told you it was a serious accident. They\nhad to use whatever was handy.\"\n\n\"I suppose so--but shouldn't they have tried to stick to the original\ncolor scheme?\"\n\n\"It's a little thing,\" he said. \"I'm lucky to be alive.\" He took her\nhand. \"I believe I can convince you I'm _me_.\"\n\n\"I wish you could.\" Her voice was low and sad and he couldn't guess why.\n\n\"My name is Dan Merrol.\"\n\n\"They told you that at the hospital.\"\n\nThey hadn't--he'd read it on the chart. But he had been alone in the\nroom and the name had to be his, and anyway he _felt_ like Dan Merrol.\n\"Your name is Erica.\"\n\n\"They told you that too.\"\n\nShe was wrong again, but it was probably wiser not to tell her how he\nknew. No one had said anything to him in the hospital. He hadn't given\nthem a chance. He had awakened in a room and hadn't wanted to be alone.\nHe'd got up and read the chart and searched dizzily through the closet.\nClothes were hanging there and he'd put them on and muttered her name\nto himself. He'd sat down to gain strength and after a while he'd\nwalked out and no one had stopped him.\n\nIt was night when he left the hospital and the next thing he remembered\nwas her face as he looked through the door. Her name hadn't been on the\nchart nor her address and yet he had found her. That proved something,\ndidn't it? \"How could I forget you?\" he demanded.\n\n\"You may have known someone else with that name. When were we married?\"\n\nMaybe he should have stayed in the hospital. It would have been easier\nto convince her there. But he'd been frantic to get home. \"It was quite\na smashup,\" he said. \"You'll have to expect some lapses.\"\n\n\"I'm making allowances. But can't you tell me something about myself?\"\n\nHe thought--and couldn't. He wasn't doing so well. \"Another lapse,\"\nhe said gloomily and then brightened. \"But I can tell you lots about\nmyself. For instance, I'm a specialist in lepidoptera.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"At the moment, who knows? Anyway, I'm a well-known actor and a\nmusician and a first-rate mathematician. I can't remember any equations\noffhand except C equals pi R squared. It has to do with the velocity\nof light. And the rest of the stuff will come back in time.\" It was\neasier now that he'd started and he went on rapidly. \"I'm thirty-three\nand after making a lot of money wrestling, married six girls, not\nnecessarily in this order--Lucille, Louise, Carolyn, Katherine, Shirley\nand Miriam.\" That was quite a few marriages--maybe it was thoughtless\nof him to have mentioned them. No woman approves her predecessors.\n\n\"That's six. Where do I come in?\"\n\n\"Erica. You're the seventh and best.\" It was just too many, now that he\nthought of it, and it didn't seem right.\n\nShe sighed and drew away. \"That was a lucky guess on your age.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDid that mean he wasn't right on anything else? From the expression\non her face, it did. \"You've got to expect me to be confused in the\nbeginning. Can't you really tell who I am?\"\n\n\"I _can't_! You don't have the same personality at all.\" She glanced at\nher arm. There was a bruise on it.\n\n\"Did I do that?\" he asked.\n\n\"You did, though I'm sure you didn't mean to. I don't think you\nrealized how strong you were. Dan was always too gentle--he must have\nbeen afraid of me. And _you_ weren't at all.\"\n\n\"Maybe I was impetuous,\" he said. \"But it was such a long time.\"\n\n\"Almost three months. But most of that time you were floating in\ngelatin in the regrowth tank, unconscious until yesterday.\" She\nleaned forward and caressed his cheek. \"Everything seems wrong, no\nmatter how hard I try to believe otherwise. You don't have the same\npersonality--you can't remember anything.\"\n\n\"And I have one brown eye and one green.\"\n\n\"It's not just that, darling. Go over to the mirror.\"\n\nHe had been seriously injured and he was still weak from the shock. He\ngot up and walked unsteadily to the mirror. \"Now what?\"\n\n\"Stand beside it. Do you see the line?\" Erica pointed to the glass.\n\nHe did--it was a mark level with his chin. \"What does it mean?\"\n\n\"That should be the top of Dan Merrol's head,\" she said softly.\n\nHe was a good six inches taller than he ought to be. But there must be\nsome explanation for the added height. He glanced down at his legs.\nThey were the same length from hip bone to the soles of his feet, but\nthe proportions differed from one side to the other. His knees didn't\nmatch. _Be-dum, be-dum, be-dumdum, but your knees don't match_--the\nsnatch of an ancient song floated through his head.\n\nQuickly, he scanned himself. It was the same elsewhere. The upper right\narm was massive, too big for the shoulder it merged with. And the\nforearm, while long, was slender. He blinked and looked again. While\nthey were patching him up, did they really think he needed black, red\nand brown hair? He wondered how a beagle felt.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat were they, a bunch of humorists? Did they, for comic effect, piece\ntogether a body out of bits and scraps left over from a chopping block?\nIt was himself he was looking at, otherwise he'd say the results were\nneither hideous nor horrible, but merely--well, what? Ludicrous and\nlaughable--and there were complications in that too. Who wants to be\nan involuntary clown, a physical buffoon that Mother Nature hadn't\nduplicated since Man began?\n\nHe felt the stubble on his face with his left hand--he _thought_ it\nwas his left hand--at least it was on that side. The emerging whiskers\ndidn't feel like anything he remembered. Wait a minute--was it _his_\nmemory? He leaned against the wall and nearly fell down. The length of\nthat arm was unexpectedly different.\n\nHe hobbled over to a chair and sat down, staring miserably at Erica as\nshe began dressing. There was quite a contrast between the loveliness\nof her body and the circus comedy of his own.\n\n\"Difficult, isn't it?\" she said, tugging her bra together and closing\nthe last snap, which took considerable effort. She was a small girl\ngenerally, though not around the chest.\n\nIt was difficult and in addition to his physique there were the\nmemories he couldn't account for. Come to think of it, he must have\nbeen awfully busy to have so many careers in such a short time--_and_\nall those wives too.\n\nErica came close and leaned comfortingly against him, but he wasn't\ncomforted. \"I waited till I was sure. I didn't want to upset you.\"\n\nHe wasn't as sure as she seemed to be now. Somehow, maybe he was still\nDan Merrol--but he wasn't going to insist on it--not after looking at\nhimself. Not after trying to sort out those damned memories.\n\nShe was too kind, pretending to be a little attracted to him, to the\nscrambled face, to the mismatched lumps and limbs and shapes that,\nstretching the term, currently formed his body. It was clear what he\nhad to do.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe jacket he had worn last night didn't fit. Erica cut off the sleeve\nthat hung far over his fingertips on one side and basted it to the\nsleeve that ended well above his wrist, on the other. The shoulders\nwere narrow, but the material would stretch and after shrugging around\nin it, he managed to expand it so it was not too tight.\n\nThe trousers were also a problem--six inches short with no material\nto add on, but here again Erica proved equal to the task and, using\nthe cuffs, contrived to lengthen them. Shoes were another difficulty.\nFor one foot the size was not bad, but he could almost step out of the\nother shoe. When she wasn't looking, he wadded up a spare sock and\nstuffed it in the toe.\n\nHe looked critically at himself in the mirror. Dressed, his total\neffect was better than he had dared hope it would be. True, he did look\n_different_.\n\nErica gazed at him with melancholy affection. \"I can't understand why\nthey let you out wearing those clothes--or for that matter, why they\nlet you out at all.\"\n\nHe must have given some explanation as he'd stumbled through the door.\nWhat was it?\n\n\"When I brought the clothes yesterday, they told me I couldn't see you\nfor a day or so,\" she mused aloud. \"It was the first time you'd been\nout of the regrowth tank--where no one could see you--and they didn't\nknow the clothes wouldn't fit. You were covered with a sheet, sleeping,\nI think. They let me peek in and I could make out a corner of your\nface.\"\n\nIt was the clothes, plus the brief glimpse of his face, which had made\nher think she recognized him when he came in.\n\n\"They told me you'd have to have psychotherapy and I'd have to have\norientation before I could see you. That's why I was so surprised when\nyou rang the bell.\"\n\nHis head was churning with ideas, trying to sort them out. Part of last\nnight was dim, part sharp and satisfying.\n\n\"What's Wysocki's theorem?\" she asked.\n\n\"_Whose_ theorem?\"\n\n\"Wysocki's. I started to call the hospital and you wouldn't let me,\nbecause of the theorem. You said you'd explain it this morning.\" She\nglanced at the bruise on her arm.\n\nIt was then he'd grabbed her, to keep her from talking to the hospital.\nHe'd been unnecessarily rough, but that could be ascribed to lack of\ncoordination. She could have been terrified, might have resisted--but\nshe hadn't. At that time, she must have half-believed he was Dan\nMerrol, still dangerously near the edges of post-regrowth shock.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe was looking at him, waiting for that explanation. He shook his\nmind frantically and the words came out. \"Self-therapy,\" he said\nbriskly. \"The patient alone understands what he needs.\" She started to\ninterrupt, but he shook his head and went on blithely. \"That's the\nfirst corollary of the theorem. The second is that there are critical\ntimes in the recovery of the patient. At such times, with the least\npossible supervision, he should be encouraged to make his own decisions\nand carry them through by himself, even though running a slight risk of\nphysical complications.\"\n\n\"That's new, isn't it?\" she said. \"I always thought they watched the\npatient carefully.\"\n\nIt ought to be new--he'd just invented it. \"You know how rapidly\nmedical practices change,\" he said quickly. \"Anyway, when they\nexamined me last night, I was much stronger than they expected--so,\nwhen I wanted to come home, they let me. It's their latest belief that\ninitiative is more important than perfect health.\"\n\n\"Strange,\" she muttered. \"But you are very strong.\" She looked at him\nand blushed. \"Initiative, certainly you have. Dan could use some,\nwherever he is.\"\n\nDan again, whether it was himself or another person. For a brief time,\nas she listened to him, he'd had the silly idea that.... But it could\nnever happen to him. He'd better leave now while she was distracted and\nbewildered and believed what he was saying. \"I've got to go. I'm due\nback,\" he told her.\n\n\"Not before you eat,\" she said. \"Any man who's spent the night with me\nis hungry in the morning.\"\n\nIt was a domestic miracle that amidst all the pressing and fitting,\nshe'd somehow prepared breakfast and he hadn't noticed. It was a simple\nchore with the automatics, but to him it seemed a proof of her wifely\nskill.\n\nHe wanted to protest, but didn't. Maybe it was the hand she was\nholding--it seemed to be equipped with a better set of nerves than its\npredecessor. It tingled at her touch. Sadly, he sat down and looked at\nhis food. Eat? Did he want to eat? Oddly enough, he did.\n\n\"How much do you remember of the accident?\" She shoved aside her own\nfood and sat watching him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNot a thing, now that she asked. In fact, there wasn't much he did\nremember. There had been the chart at his bed-side, with one word\nscrawled on it--_accident_--and that was where he'd got the idea. There\nhad been other marks too, but he hadn't been able to decipher them. He\nnodded and said nothing and she took it as he thought she would.\n\n\"It wasn't anybody's fault. The warning devices which were supposed to\nwork didn't,\" she began. \"A Moon ship collided with a Mars liner in\nthe upper atmosphere. The ships broke up in several parts and since\nthey are compartmented and the delay rockets switched on immediately,\nthe separate parts fell rather gently, considering how high they were.\nCasualties weren't as great as you might think.\n\n\"Parts of the two ships fell together, the rest were scattered. There\nwas some interchange of passengers in the wreckage, but since you were\nfound in the control compartment of the Mars liner, they assumed you\nwere the pilot. They never let me see you until yesterday and then\nit was just a glimpse. I took their word when they said you were Dan\nMerrol.\"\n\nAt least he knew who or what Dan Merrol was--the pilot of the Mars\nliner. They had assumed he was the pilot because of where he was found,\nbut he might have been tossed there--impact did strange things.\n\nDan Merrol was a spaceship pilot and he hadn't included it among his\nskills. It was strange that she had believed him at all. But now that\nit was out in the open, he did remember some facts about spaceships. He\nfelt he could manage a takeoff at this instant.\n\nBut why hadn't he told her? Shock? Perhaps--but where had those other\nidentities come from--lepidopterist, musician, actor, mathematician\nand wrestler? And where had he got memories of wives, slender and\npassionate, petite and wild, casual and complaisant, nagging and\ninsecure?\n\nErica he didn't remember at all, save from last night, and what was\nthat due to?\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" he asked, deliberately toying with the last\nbite of breakfast. It gave him time to think.\n\n\"They said they'd identified everyone, living or dead, and I supposed\nthey had. After seeing you, I can believe they made any number of\nsimilar mistakes. Dan Merrol may be alive under another name. It will\nbe hard to do, but I must try to find him. Some of the accident victims\nwent to other hospitals, you know, the ones located nearest where they\nfell.\"\n\nEven if he was sure, he didn't know whether he could tell her--and he\nwasn't sure any longer, although he had been. On the physical side of\nmarriage, how could he ask her to share a body she'd have to laugh at?\nLater, he might tell her, if there was to be a 'later.' He pushed back\nhis chair and looked at her uncertainly.\n\n\"Let me call a 'copter,\" she said. \"I hate to see you go.\"\n\n\"Wysocki's theorem,\" he told her. \"The patient has decided to walk.\"\nHe weaved toward the door and twisted the knob. He turned in time to\ncatch her in his arms.\n\n\"I know this is wrong,\" she said, pressing against him.\n\nIt might be wrong, but it was very pleasant, though he did guess her\nmotives. She was a warmhearted girl and couldn't help pitying him.\n\"Don't be so damned considerate,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"You'll have to put me down,\" she said, averting her eyes.\n\"Otherwise.... You're an intolerable funny man.\"\n\nHe knew it--he could see himself in the mirror. He was something to\nlaugh at when anyone got tired of pretending sympathy. He put her down\nand stumbled out. He thought he could hear the bed creak as she threw\nherself on it.\n\n\nII\n\nOnce he got started, walking wasn't hard. His left side swung at a\ndifferent rate from his right, but that was due to the variation in\nthe length of his thighs and lower legs, and the two rhythms could be\nreconciled. He swept along, gaining control of his muscles. He became\naware that he was whizzing past everyone.\n\nHe slowed down--he didn't want to attract attention. It was difficult\nbut he learned to walk at a pedestrian pace. However poorly they'd\nmatched his legs, they'd given him good ones.\n\nLast night, on an impulse, he'd left the hospital and now he had to go\nback. _Had_ to? Of course. There were too many uncertainties still to\nbe settled. He glanced around. It was still very early in the morning\nand normal traffic was just beginning. Maybe they hadn't missed him\nyet, though it was unlikely.\n\nHe seemed to know the route well enough and covered the distance in a\nbrief time. He turned in at the building and, scanning the directory,\nwent at once to the proper floor and stopped at the desk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe receptionist was busy with the drawer of the desk. \"Can I help\nyou?\" she asked, continuing to peer down.\n\n\"The director--Doctor Crander. I don't have an appointment.\"\n\n\"Then the director can't see you.\" The girl looked up and her firmly\npolite expression became a grimace of barely suppressed laughter.\n\nThen laughter was swept away. What replaced it he couldn't say, but it\ndidn't seem related to humor. She placed her hand near his but it went\nastray and got tangled with his fingers. \"I just thought of a joke,\"\nshe murmured. \"Please don't think that I consider you at all funny.\"\n\nThe hell she didn't--and it was the second time within the hour a woman\nhad used that word on him. He wished they'd stop. He took back his\nhand, the slender one, an exquisite thing that might once have belonged\nto a musician. Was there an instrument played with one hand? The other\none was far larger and clumsier, more suited to mayhem than music.\n\"When can I see the director?\"\n\nShe blinked at him. \"A patient?\" She didn't need to look twice to see\nthat he had been one. \"The director does occasionally see ex-patients.\"\n\nHe watched her appreciatively as she went inside. The way she walked,\nyou'd think she had a special audience. Presently the door opened and\nshe came back, batting her eyes vigorously.\n\n\"You can go in now,\" she said huskily. Strange, her voice had dropped\nan octave in less than a minute. \"The old boy tried to pretend he was\nin the middle of a grave emergency.\"\n\nOn his way in, he miscalculated, or she did, and he brushed against\nher. The touch was pleasant, but not thrilling. That reaction seemed\nreserved for Erica.\n\n\"Glad to see you,\" said Doctor Crander, behind the desk. He was nervous\nand harassed for so early in the morning. \"The receptionist didn't give\nme your name. For some reason she seems upset.\"\n\nShe did at that, he thought--probably bewildered by his appearance. The\nhospital didn't seem to have a calming influence on either her or the\ndoctor. \"That's why I came here. I'm not sure who I am. I thought I was\nDan Merrol.\"\n\nDoctor Crander tried to fight his way through the desk. Being a little\nwider and solider, though not by much, the desk won. He contented\nhimself by wiping his forehead. \"Our missing patient,\" he said, sighing\nwith vast relief. \"For a while I had visions of....\" He then decided\nthat visions were nothing a medical man should place much faith in.\n\n\"Then I _am_ Dan Merrol?\"\n\nThe doctor came cautiously around the desk this time. \"Of course. I\ndidn't expect that you'd come walking in my office--that's why I didn't\nrecognize you immediately.\" He exhaled peevishly. \"Where did you go?\nWe've been searching for you everywhere.\"\n\nIt seemed wiser to Dan not to tell him everything. \"It was stuffy\ninside. I went out for a stroll before the nurse came in.\"\n\nCrander frowned, his nervousness rapidly disappearing. \"Then it was\nabout an hour ago. We didn't think you could walk at all so soon, or we\nwould have kept someone on duty through the night.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey had underestimated him, but he didn't mind. Of course, he didn't\nknow how a patient from the regrowth tanks was supposed to act.\nThe doctor took his pulse. \"Seems fine,\" he said, surprised. \"Sit\ndown--please sit down.\"\n\nWithout waiting for him to comply, Crander pushed him into a chair and\nbegan hauling out a variety of instruments with which he poked about\nhis bewildered patient.\n\nFinally Crander seemed satisfied. \"Excellent,\" he said. \"If I didn't\nknow better, I'd say you were almost fully recovered. A week ago, we\nconsidered removing you from the regrowth tank. Our decision to leave\nyou there an extra week has paid off very, very nicely.\"\n\nMerrol wasn't as pleased as the doctor appeared to be. \"Granted you can\nidentify me as the person who came out of regrowth--but does that mean\nI'm Dan Merrol? Could there be a mistake?\"\n\nCrander eyed him clinically. \"We don't ordinarily do this--but it is\nevident that with you peace of mind is more important than procedure.\nAnd you look well enough to stand the physical strain.\"\n\nHe pressed the buzzer and an angular woman in her early forties\nanswered. \"Miss Jerrems, the Dan Merrol file.\"\n\nMiss Jerrems flashed a glance of open adoration at the doctor and\nbefore she could reel it in, her gaze swept past Dan, hesitated and\nreturned to him. Her mouth opened and closed like that of a nervous\ngoldfish and she darted from the room.\n\n_They see me and flee as fast as they can caper_, thought Merrol. It\nwas not wholly true--Crander didn't seem much affected. But he was a\ndoctor and used to it. Furthermore, he probably had room for only one\nemotion at the moment--relief at the return of his patient.\n\nMiss Jerrems came back, wheeling a large cart. Dan was surprised at the\nmass of records. Crander noticed his expression and smiled. \"You're\nour prize case, Merrol. I've never heard of anyone else surviving\nsuch extensive surgery. Naturally, we have a step-by-step account of\neverything we did.\"\n\nHe turned to the woman. \"You may leave, Miss Jerrems.\" She went, but\nthe adoration she had showed so openly for her employer seemed to have\ncurdled in the last few moments.\n\nCrander dug into the files and rooted out photographs. \"Here are\npictures of the wreckage in which you were found--notice that you were\nstrapped in your seat--as you were received into the hospital--at\nvarious stages in surgery and finally, some taken from the files of the\ncompany for which you worked.\"\n\nMerrol winced. The photographic sequence was incontrovertible. He had\nbeen a handsome fellow.\n\n\"Here is other evidence you may not have heard of. It's a recent\ndevelopment, within the last ten years, in fact. It still isn't\naccepted by most courts--they're always lagging--but to medical men\nit's the last word.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMerrol studied the patterns of waves and lines and splotches. \"What is\nit?\"\n\n\"Mass-cell radiographs. One was loaned by your employer. The other was\ntaken just after your last operation. Both were corrected according\nto standard methods. One cell won't do it, ten yield an uncertain\nidentity--but as few as a hundred cells from any part of the original\nbody, excepting the blood, constitute proof more positive than\nfingerprints before the surgical exchange of limbs. Don't ask me\nwhy--no one knows. But it is true that cells differ from one body to\nthe next, and this test detects the difference.\"\n\nThe mass-cell radiographs did seem identical and Dr. Crander seemed\ncertain. Taken altogether, the evidence was overwhelming. There had\nbeen no mistake--he was Dan Merrol, though it was not difficult to\nunderstand why Erica couldn't believe he was her husband.\n\n\"You did a fine job,\" he said. Recalling the picture of the wreckage,\nhe knew they had. \"But couldn't you have done just a little better?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCrander's eyebrows bounced up. \"We're amazed at how well we have\ndone. You can search case histories and find nothing comparable.\" His\neyebrows dropped back into place. \"Of course, if you have a specific\ncomplaint....\"\n\n\"Nothing specific. But look at this hand....\"\n\nThe doctor seized it. \"Beautiful, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Perhaps--taken by itself.\" Dan rolled up his sleeve. \"See how it joins\nthe forearm.\"\n\nCrander waggled it gravely. \"It coordinates perfectly. I've observed\nyou have complete control over it. The doctor's eye, my boy. The\ndoctor's diagnostic eye.\"\n\nThe other just didn't understand. \"But the size--it doesn't match my\narm!\"\n\n\"Doesn't _match_?\" cried the doctor. \"Do you have any idea of the\nbiological ways in which it _does_ match? True, it may not be\nesthetically harmonized, but here we delve into the mysteries of the\nhuman organism, and we can hardly be striving for Botticelli bodies and\nMichelangelo men. First, your hand moves freely at the joint, a triumph\nof surgical skill.\" He moved the hand experimentally, to show Merrol\nhow it was done. He dropped the hand and hurried to a screen against\nthe wall.\n\nCrander drew his finger across the surface and the mark remained. \"You\nknow about Rh positive and negative blood. Mixed, they can be lethal.\nThis was discovered long ago, by someone I've forgotten. But there are\nother factors just as potent and far more complex.\"\n\nHe scribbled meaningless symbols on the screen with his finger. \"Take\nthe bone factors--three. They must be matched in even such a slight\ncontact as a joint ... this was done. Then there are the tissue\nfactors--four. Tendon factors--two. Nerve-splice factors--three\nagain. After that, we move into a complex field, hormone-utilization\nfactors--seven at the latest count and more coming up with further\nresearch.\n\n\"That's the beginning, but at the sensory organs we leave the simple\nstuff behind. Take the eye, for instance.\" Merrol leaned away because\nDr. Crander seemed about to pluck one of Dan's eyes from its socket.\n\"Surgical and growth factors involved in splicing a massive nerve\nbundle pass any layman's comprehension. There are no non-technical\nterms to describe it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was just as well--Merrol didn't want a lecture. He extended his\narms. One was of normal length, the other longer. \"Do you think you can\ndo something with this? I don't mind variation in thickness--some of\nthat will smooth out as I exercise--but I'd like them the same length.\"\n\n\"There were many others injured at the same time, you know--and you\nwere one of the last to be extricated from the ship. Normally, when\nwe have to replace a whole arm, we do so at the shoulder for obvious\nreasons. But the previously treated victims had depleted our supplies.\nSome needed only a hand and we gave them just that, others a hand and\na forearm, and so on. When we got to you, we had to use leftovers or\npermit you to die--there wasn't time to send to other hospitals. In\nfact there wasn't any time at all--we actually thought you were dead,\nbut soon found we were wrong.\"\n\nCrander stared at a crack in the ceiling. \"Further recovery will take\nother operations and your nervous system isn't up to it.\" He shook his\nhead. \"Five years from now, we can help you, not before.\"\n\nMerrol turned away miserably. There were other things, but he had\nlearned the essentials. He was Dan Merrol and there was nothing they\ncould do for him until it was too late. How long could he expect Erica\nto wait?\n\nThe doctor hadn't finished the medical session. \"Replacement of body\nparts is easy, after all. The big trouble came when we went into the\nbrain.\"\n\n\"Brain?\" Dan was startled.\n\n\"How hard do you think your skull is?\" Crander came closer. \"Bend your\nhead.\"\n\nMerrol obeyed and could feel the doctor's forefinger slice across his\nscalp in a mock operation. \"This sector was crushed.\" Roughly half his\nbrain, it appeared. \"That's why so many memories were gone--not just\nfrom shock. In addition, other sectors were damaged and had to be\nreplaced.\"\n\nCrander traced out five areas he could feel, but not see. \"Samuel\nKaufman, musician--Breed Mannly, cowboy actor--George Elkins,\nlepidopterist--Duke DeCaesares, wrestler--and Ben Eisenberg,\nmathematician, went into the places I tapped.\"\n\nDan raised his head. Some things were clearer. The memories were\nauthentic, but they weren't his--nor did the other wives belong to him.\nIt was no wonder Erica had cringed at their names.\n\n\"These donors were dead, but you can be thankful we had parts of their\nbrains available.\" Crander delved into the file and came up with a\nsheet.\n\n\"Here are some body part contributors.\" He read rapidly. \"Dimwiddie,\nBarton, Colton, Morton, Flam and Carnera were responsible for arms and\nhands. Greenberg, Rochefault, Gonzalez, Tall-Cloud, Gowraddy and Tsin\nsupplied feet and legs.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was not a man, Merrol thought. Not now. If anything, he was a\nconvention and one body was not a large enough hotel to hold it in\ncomfort.\n\n\"These were the major human donors, but there were others I didn't\nbother to read, for the kidneys and so on. And I think our four-footed\nfriends deserve some mention.\" He looked up. \"The skin on your face is\nfrom a pig embryo.\"\n\nThat explained why it was hard to shave. \"_Oink?_\" he said. \"I mean did\nit have to be a pig?\"\n\n\"You'd be surprised how hard it is to transplant human skin,\" commented\nCrander. \"Besides, we wanted to give you a masculine look. The finest\nface there is, genuine pigskin.\"\n\nMerrol felt like a wallet.\n\nThe doctor droned on through the list, but Merrol scarcely listened.\nOnly once did he interrupt, to ask incredulously, \"Did you say a\n_horse_?\"\n\n\"Is there anything wrong with a horse?\"\n\nMerrol thought back. Come to consider it, there was nothing wrong--in\nfact, compliments were more in order.\n\n\"The skill that went into matching the unrelated parts that are now\nyou is a landmark in medical history, quite comparable to Harvey's\ndiscovery of the circulation of the blood,\" said Dr. Crander. \"I\nwouldn't believe it if I hadn't participated in it myself. There have\nbeen limb and brain replacements before, but never on such a scale. One\nof these days, we'll get out a report that will astound the medical\nworld.\"\n\nWithout doubt, it would. Merrol tried to feel grateful, but gratitude\nrefused to come. They had saved him--but was it worth it?\n\nPuzzled, Crander frowned at the buzzer. He'd been pressing it\nintermittently for the past few minutes. \"Doesn't seem to be working,\"\nhe muttered, heading toward the door through which Merrol had entered.\n\"Wait here--I'll be back. I have to cancel an appointment.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs soon as the door closed, a voice behind Merrol hissed. \"I fixed the\nbuzzer. He went for the guards.\"\n\nHe whirled. Miss Jerrems stood in the doorway that led into the filing\nroom on the opposite side of the office. \"Guards?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Of course--guards for the violent patients.\"\n\n\"What does that have to do with me?\"\n\n\"You escaped once, didn't you?\"\n\nHe hadn't escaped, he had merely walked out when he felt he could. Did\nthat qualify him as violent? It might. \"What of it? I'm no longer a\npatient. The doctor said I had recovered.\"\n\n\"That's what he said to _you_. But even if he means it, there's always\npsychotherapy, post-re-growth orientation.\"\n\nOrientation--he hadn't thought of that. They'd want to keep him under\nobservation for several days and he had no desire to stay hospitalized.\nErica would come to the hospital in a few hours. Perhaps she was there\nnow, waiting to see someone. Come to think of it, he had got past the\nreceptionist with remarkable ease. At any rate, if she was insistent\nabout it, she must eventually get to see the evidence he had just\nstudied.\n\nAnd then there would be orientation--for both of them.\n\nWithout doubt, he would be taught to accept himself as he was, and\nErica would be trained to look at him without laughter, and together\nthey would know that beneath his piebald exterior lurked a lovely\npersonality. Then, well adjusted, they would go home and live happily\never after. Or would they?\n\n\"Don't stand there, if you want to get away,\" Miss Jerrems whispered\nurgently. \"Next time they won't take any chances.\"\n\nThey wouldn't. He would be confined to a room he couldn't break out of\nwith guards disguised as nurses. Blindly he moved toward the door.\n\n\"Not there,\" she exclaimed. \"Do you want to walk right into them? This\nway. They won't look for you in here.\" She clasped his hand in her bony\nfingers and led him through the maze of files to an elevator. \"This\ntakes you to the ground floor,\" she said. \"Once outside, you can get\naway.\"\n\nHe probably could--it was a large building and it would take a\nprolonged search to determine that he was not inside it.\n\nShe smiled peculiarly, clearing her throat. \"Thirty-seven Brighton\nDrive.\"\n\nMechanically he repeated the number. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"That's where you can find out.\"\n\n\"Find out what?\"\n\n\"What they did to you here. I can't tell you now,\" she whispered\nnervously. \"Oh, _do_ hurry!\"\n\nIf he had to move fast, this seemed a good time. The elevator dropped\nhim to the street level and, looking cautiously around, he walked out.\nIn a few minutes, he was blocks away. It was mid-morning, and he swung\nalong, hands thrust into his jacket. There was a wad of paper inside\nand he fished it out and examined it--money, neatly folded with a note\naround it.\n\nThe note was from Erica, saying that the money was meant for him. The\nsum was not great, but she must have given him everything she had in\nthe house. Mistily, he counted it out.\n\n\nIII\n\nDan hadn't been stopped and didn't expect to be. He wasn't a criminal,\nbut until the hospital released him, he was technically a mental case.\nBut Crander would hardly be anxious to report to the police that a\npatient was missing--not until he had tried everything else.\n\nMerrol took the elevator. It was a bright new apartment building, which\nconferred some social status and not much else on those living in it.\n\nMiss Jerrems opened the door. \"Come in,\" she said, looking around\nfurtively as he slipped past her.\n\nHe sat down gingerly, watching her scurry about. He tried to protest,\nbut nothing he said had any effect on her aggressive hospitality.\nShe thrust a cup of watery coffee in his hand and placed a tray of\nbreakfast rolls beside him.\n\nShe sat facing him. Their knees almost touched--it was a narrow room.\n\"I came home at once,\" she said, not very successful in her attempt to\ncontrol her excitement. \"I told them I was upset and, after my long\nyears of service, they didn't question me. I tore my dress and told\nthem you had done it. I said that you ran up toward the top of the\nbuilding.\"\n\nHe appreciated her motives, but thought she shouldn't have tried so\nhard to convince them. Now they had reason to think he was violent.\n\n\"Until today, I've been devoted to Doctor Crander,\" she said sternly.\n\nHe recalled the first look on her face in the doctor's office--and the\none after she had seen him. In seconds, her whole attitude had changed.\nWhy?\n\n\"I heard what he told you.\" She hissed the word--\"Lies.\"\n\nDan stared at her skeptically. \"They didn't do what he said?\"\n\n\"Oh, the facts were straight enough,\" she said bitterly. \"It was the\nreasons he concealed. They thought you didn't have a chance, so they\ndid all sorts of strange things they never tried on anyone else. You\nwere an experiment, that's all--but you surprised them.\"\n\nThe hospital was looking for the wrong mental case. They had one\nworking for them and didn't know it. He didn't doubt that she was\nright--about his being an experiment--but her observations were wrong.\nIt was due entirely to their unorthodox procedures that he was alive.\n\nShe looked him over carefully and he knew that the halves of his face\ndidn't match by a ridiculous margin, that one shoulder was heavier than\nthe other, that his hair was in three colors. Even in repose and fully\nclothed, so that some of the discrepancies of his physique were hidden,\nhe was hardly presentable.\n\n\"When I saw you standing there today, I realized what they had done to\nyou and my loyalty to the institution and the doctor vanished,\" she\nsaid earnestly. \"And the psychotherapy isn't to help you, it's to make\nsure you won't protest over what they've done. That's why I had to get\nyou away. They've ruined you and now _you_ must ruin _them_.\"\n\nHe had half-suspected it would come to this--but he hadn't been sure.\n\"I don't want to ruin them,\" he said slowly. \"I'd rather be alive, even\nas an experiment. And if you're thinking of a malpractice suit, you saw\nthe files. I couldn't win against that.\"\n\n\"I ought to know about the files--I worked on them.\" Her eyes sparkled\nand her voice lowered. \"What if the evidence is missing?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe sat back. With her co-operation, the vital parts of the file could\nvanish and, with that gone, he could collect a staggering amount from\nthe institution. He had only to appear and no jury or panels of experts\nwould decide against him. Is that what she had planned so swiftly\nin the director's office--that she would share the money with him?\nSomehow, he couldn't believe money meant that much to her. \"I can't\npermit it,\" he said. \"In spite of everything, I feel obligated.\"\n\nShe flung herself across the narrow space. \"I expected you to be\nnoble,\" she sobbed. \"One look at you, and I knew I had met the\nloneliest person in the world.\"\n\nLike called to like, at least for her, and that explained why she had\ngrimaced when she had first seen him. It was her counterpart of the\nreceptionist's reaction. It explained, too, why she was willing to turn\nagainst the doctor she had previously adored. As for the money, she\ndidn't want it for herself, but as bait for him--and he'd have to take\nher with it.\n\nShe had guessed wrong on all counts. He would have thrust her away, but\nit would have been too cruel. He tried to comfort her, and she dried\nher eyes on his shoulder. \"Darling,\" she sniffled. \"I've never yielded\nto any man, but if it will help you....\"\n\nShe pressed close and he couldn't get away without breaking through\nthe thin walls of the cramped apartment. He had never known a female\nform could be shaped around so many bones. \"These things take time,\" he\nsaid, though they didn't. \"Let's not rush into anything we'll regret.\"\nHe seemed to arouse the motherly instinct in some women, if only in the\nfuture tense.\n\nPresently, she sat up, blowing her nose and looking ardently at him\nthrough tear-rimmed eyes. \"You can stay here. You've no place else to\ngo, and they'll be looking for you.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said--but it was true. He shouldn't be wandering on the\nstreets.\n\nHe slept that night on a sink that converted to a bed. It would have\nbeen more comfortable unconverted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe crept out in the morning before she was awake. He paused outside\nto scribble a note, principally to throw her off his track. You never\ncould tell with so unstable a person. Implicated in his escape, she\nmight nevertheless report to the hospital. He shoved the note under the\ndoor and left quickly and quietly.\n\nHis first move was to buy a hat, which entailed further trouble. The\ndoctors had overcompensated in replacing the missing brain tissue and,\nin piecing a skull together, had constructed an outsized head on which\nnothing seemed to fit. By careful shopping, he found something that did\nfit and, when he'd clapped it on, he happily noted it concealed the\ntricolor hair ... one item less to attract attention.\n\nHe ate and afterward walked to the rocketport. It was a long distance\nand formerly he might have complained, but now he didn't mind it. The\nmiles seemed to have shrunk to furlongs.\n\nHe found the big _Interplanet_ sign and examined the place minutely\nfrom the outside. Once he had worked there, technically he still did.\nSome memories came back, but not many. He needed at least an hour\ninside to enable him to forget the hospital and its psychotherapy.\n\nOnce cleared, he would be free for a while to concentrate on what to do\nabout Erica.\n\nThe hospital evidently had yet to call in the police. He was still safe\non the streets, but the medicos must have notified _Interplanet_ and\nall other places at which he might show up. However, the company was\ntoo big for everyone to know about him this soon. More likely there\nwould be only a few who could have information on him as yet. The trick\nwas to bypass those individuals who might try to detain him and still\nget where he wanted.\n\nNormally, he'd go to the front office after an accident. This time, he\nwent to the side gate and when the guard looked at him questioningly,\nmumbled, \"Reporting for duty.\" Which got him through.\n\nInside, there were more memories awaiting him. Depending on them, he\nwalked rapidly through hall after hall and finally found the desk he\nsought. The man behind it looked up. \"Are you sure you're in the right\nplace?\" he asked.\n\nMerrol would soon know. \"Reporting for duty,\" he stated.\n\nThis reply elicited a puzzled expression. \"The devil you are. We\nhaven't hired anyone new.\"\n\n\"I'm not new. I've been injured, and this is my first time back. Dan\nMerrol's my name.\"\n\n\"Okay, where's your slip?\"\n\n\"Slip?\" he asked, stalling. This was something he ought to know about,\nbut didn't.\n\n\"Sure, the release from the front office after an injury.\"\n\n\"They said they'd send it down,\" he replied, holding his breath.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe clerk pawed through the stack. \"They don't send nothing down,\" he\ngrowled. \"I'll call and find out.\" His hand reached out and then he\nrelaxed. \"No use bothering them, it'll get here tomorrow.\" He looked up\nand laughed. \"Red tape,\" he said by way of explanation. \"Why should I\ndoubt you? If you said they released you, then they did.\"\n\nMerrol was glad to see one man who wasn't impressed by office routines.\nStill, his behavior was a little puzzling.\n\nThe man screened on. The communication unit was behind the desk, tilted\nso he couldn't see it. The volume was low, but Dan could hear the\nconversation from this end. \"Got a case for you. Name is Dan Merrol. I\ndon't know, he's before my time.\"\n\nThe reply was faint and Dan didn't catch it. But the clerk added, \"He\nseems okay. What? Sure he's got a release. Would I send him in?\"\n\nHe cut the connection and looked up. \"Go over to Psych. They'll test\nyou. If you pass, we'll put you back on schedule.\" He started to turn\naway and saw Merrol standing there. \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I don't know where Psych is.\"\n\n\"I see. We must have moved things since you were here.\" The man got up\nand pointed. \"Down there and turn left at the second corner. You can't\nmiss.\"\n\nThe examiner was scanning a card as he entered. \"Lots of experience,\"\nhe commented. \"We'll pass over the written stuff. That's for kids, to\nmake sure they've studied their lessons. After you've been out this\nlong, you can almost feel a course faster than anyone can figure it.\"\n\nIt was a relief. Merrol didn't know how much theory he remembered, but\nwas sure he could still lift a ship as well as the next man.\n\nThe examiner made a notation on the card and tossed it into a machine\nthat snapped it up and clicked furiously over it. \"Let's take the\nbiggest thing first, if you're up to it.\"\n\n\"I feel fine.\" It was not true, but it was the customary answer.\nAnything else, and he'd be shunted off into a series of meaningless\ntests, each designed to verify the results of previous tests. An\ningenious scheme rigged up by the psych crew in their spare time\nto see how complicated they could make any given system. Answered\nstraightforwardly, they rushed a man through with a minimum of\nofficiousness.\n\n\"Okay, let's take the trip.\"\n\nHe accompanied Dan into a room unlike the others. For one thing, it\nmight have been the control room of a ship. Forward, there was the\nusual clear view. The stars were there too, in an adaptation of the\nplanetarium. Outside, arranged to give any effect from top acceleration\nto free fall, were a number of gravity coils. Except for the pilot--and\nMerrol would play that role--there was a full complement of officers\nwho were invisible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe tester flicked on a machine. \"I'll give you Mars, because that's\nyour usual run. This is a short drive, because you're in a favorable\nposition. Got it?\"\n\nMerrol nodded and climbed into the seat, facing the instruments.\n\n\"I've turned on the best crew simulators, better than you'd ever\nactually get. Don't worry about them, just take the data and flit the\nway you think you should.\" The tester clamped a mike inches away and\nadjusted the visio-recorders firmly on his head, where electron beams\ncould sneak in and tap his optic centers. \"The first trip after you've\nbeen away is rough, but you'll make it.\"\n\nMerrol strapped himself in and hoped the other man was right.\n\nThe examiner went to the door, turned and grinned. \"Watch out for the\ninterplanetary goose,\" he called and snapped the switch.\n\nMerrol was now in a ship. In the back of his mind there was some doubt\nof his ability, but it didn't reach as far as his fingers. Rockets\nvibrated beneath him. Outside, he could see the glazed earth-slick. He\ntouched the power and climbed above the clouds. The sky turned black\nand there were stars.\n\nHe checked position. The tester had given him a setup. The Moon was\nout of the way and the run to Mars was the shortest on record. If he\ncouldn't handle this, he wasn't a pilot.\n\nThe seat jabbed him suddenly. That's what he'd been warned about--he'd\nbeen expecting it and still wasn't prepared. The tempathy drugs flooded\ninto him and the needle was withdrawn.\n\nTakeoff and landing were always rehearsed on the pilot's own time.\nThe ends of a voyage were critical and it was essential to have an\nundistorted reaction. Besides, neither took long.\n\nThe time between one planet and the next was long and nothing much\nhappened, so it could be shortened without deleterious effect on the\nresults. Tempathy drugs shortened it, though not completely. Part of a\nman's consciousness went along at normal speed and the rest, that which\ncounted in jockeying rockets, was enormously telescoped.\n\nIt telescoped on Merrol. He couldn't see. Rather, part of him could\nbut, for the other fraction, images passed in front of his eyes too\nfast for his mind to evaluate. Weeks flipped past in minutes. It\nwas a dream world turned inside out--the roles of consciousness and\nunconsciousness were reversed.\n\nThere was something wrong with the sounds he half-heard. He could get\nemotions, though he couldn't separate them into sense. There were\nadditional voices that shouldn't be there--the mechanical crew spoke to\nhim giving silent data--but there were other actual voices, fearful or\nconsolatory. He tried to speak, but his vocal cords were preempted.\n\nHe was doing it all, speaking, moving the controls, directing the ship\nbetween planets. It ought to be easier than takeoff, but it wasn't. He\nshouldn't be afraid of anything he might find out there--which was\nnothing--but that didn't alter conditions. He was profoundly disturbed,\nand he hoped the tester noticed it.\n\nThe examiner did spot trouble. He opened the door and reversed the\nswitch. Lights went on, and another needle speared him, counteracting\nthe effects of the tempathy drugs. Slowly the ship disappeared, space\nalong with it, and the room whirled back into view and settled down.\nSomething handed him back his eyes and ears.\n\n\"Easy,\" said the man. \"Sit there. You don't have to move. We'll find\nout what's wrong. It may not be serious at all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnhooking the visio-recorder, the tester also swung the mike away. \"You\nwere doing fine,\" he said. \"Never saw anything smoother. About here,\nthough, you seemed to be having difficulty. We'll slow it down and see\nwhat it was.\"\n\nHe snapped the reels in place and darkened the room. On the screen\nwas the vision-port and, through it, a view of Mars. A fleck of light\nglittered, grew, became a cloud, a swarm. A swarm?\n\n\"God!\" said the tester, bewildered. \"A billion butterflies! How could\nyou imagine butterflies, twenty million miles from a planet?\"\n\nMerrol squirmed--he didn't know either. What was wrong with him to make\nhim dream up butterflies?\n\nThe examiner switched the film off and the lights on. \"So you missed\nthem--why, I don't know.\" He fiddled with another machine. \"We'll slow\ndown the sound, synchronize the two of them later, but maybe by itself\nthe sound will give us a clue as to what happened.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" It came from the sound track, but it was Merrol's voice.\n\n\"Those are lepidoptera.\" Another voice, also his, though of different\npitch and timbre--his, because he was the only one there to speak.\n\"I've always dreamed of discovering a new species and at last I have,\nsince these can fly through space. What strange adaptations they have\nmade. Aren't they beautiful?\"\n\nHe answered. \"They won't be when I plow through them. The rockets will\nfry them.\"\n\n\"Turn aside!\" shouted the lepidopterist. \"You can't destroy them.\"\n\n\"I'm going to act as if this were not happening,\" said a cultured\nvoice. \"_Bang-bang!_\"\n\n\"This is upsetting,\" said a different person. \"Since I have\nno instrument, I'll listen with my memory to a Bach concerto.\nUnfortunately, it ends in the middle of the third movement, as though\nit has been sliced through with a knife that separated one note cleanly\nfrom the next. Still, it's better to have this than nothing.\"\n\n\"Your computers are awfully slow,\" said the fifth. \"I'll figure out a\nnew course for us.\"\n\n\"Gimme the controls,\" said the wrestler. \"I'll turn the ship, if I\nhafta do it with my bare hands.\"\n\nThe examiner snapped off the sound and busied himself with things that\nmay have been necessary. \"You don't have to sit there,\" he said after a\nwhile. \"Wait outside.\" He glanced down, \"Be careful when you move, the\ncontrol column will fall off. Didn't know it could be broken.\"\n\nAs he got out of the seat, the examiner slapped his back. \"Tell you\nwhat, fellow--don't wait--go now to the Compensation Board and see\nabout retirement.\"\n\n\nIV\n\nMerrol sat in the room where he had been sitting for a day and a half\nsince the psych test. He had walked out immediately, found a room and\nwas still in it. It wasn't comfortable, sitting. Whichever position was\nright for the bend of one knee was wrong for the other.\n\nHe had depended on the test to get him out of a jam, but the stratagem\nhad failed. If he had passed, he'd have been another experienced pilot\nfor the _Interplanet_ string and that meant something. Experienced men\nwere valuable and I. P. would have gone to bat for him.\n\nNot everyone could pass the test and, while it didn't prove that the\nman who did was one hundred per cent sane, it was a big argument\nin that direction. It was evidence that would have to be respected\npublicly, whatever private doubts a psychotherapist might have.\n\nUnwittingly, he had provided additional ammunition against himself.\nWhen the results of the test sifted through the layers of red tape to\nthe front office, _Interplanet_ would contact the hospital, which would\nthen really want to orient him to a frazzle.\n\nOrientation sounded nice but it was not for Merrol. If they could\norient everyone he would come in contact with as well--but how much\ninsulation could a man build up against involuntary laughter? It was\nfine to be a comedian on the screen and then step out of character\nand relax--but what if you couldn't stop? Nobody could adjust to the\nconstant expectation of hysterical mirth. But wasn't that a reason\nto undergo psychotherapy, so they could blunt the edges of his own\nreactions? It ought to be, but somehow it wasn't. He didn't dare\nsubmit.\n\nThere was a difference, apparently determined by sex, in the way\npeople behaved toward him. No man had thus far done more than smile\nrespectfully while he was near. What they did later, he could guess.\nFace to face, they seemed to be reserved and incredulous until they\nlearned to accept him as a member of their species and sex and\nthen--how _did_ they act? It would take more than casual thinking to\npuzzle _that_ out.\n\nWomen saw the big joke instantly and giggled, and he couldn't blame\nthem. Seconds later, they smirked contritely and tried to touch him, as\nif contact could atone for their behavior. _They_ noticed appearance at\nall times, whereas men didn't as a rule of their own sex.\n\nHe paused to re-examine his thoughts. Something seemed to be missing in\nhis analysis. What it was, he couldn't tell. It would have to come out\nlater, as he mingled more with people--if he ever did.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd that wasn't all. He had been a pilot, but never would be one\nagain. His skill had been destroyed by the intrusion of five other\npersonalities, who each brought his own odd bit of useless knowledge to\nthe whole Merrol. He should have expected it, but he hadn't, nor had\nthe doctors.\n\nIt was obvious--the brain slices that had replaced his own damaged\ntissues had to be in healthy condition or they'd never have functioned\nproperly--and what did those medical fools think was the function of\nany brain? He was in command of the group brain because his was the\ndominant fraction, but when he sat down and thought about it, what good\ndid it do? He was sitting down and it didn't do any good, so he got up.\n\nHe took two paces across the room and looked out the window, into\nwindows that looked into his. Compensation was coming to him.\nUltimately, he'd divide it with Erica and go away. She must know by now\nthat the man she had spent the night with was actually her own husband.\nIntellectually she must have decided to accept him.\n\nHe wasn't noble, though. Much as he wanted her, he knew he couldn't\nlive with anyone who had to stifle her laughter when he stepped out of\nthe bath or into bed.\n\nHe walked the carpet aimlessly until, through the window, he caught a\nword from the telecast in the next apartment. He thought it sounded\nfamiliar. He yanked the louvers closed and grunted, but it didn't\nhelp--the word bothered him. He reached out the long arm to turn on his\nown screen.\n\nA face came into view and a man's voice whispered. Merrol turned up the\nvolume, but it didn't get any louder. It was the low-pressure soothing\ntype. Whatever he was selling, it was a welcome change.\n\nThe announcer smiled reassuringly. \"Actually, I'm talking to one\nperson. The rest of you may listen or not for the next five minutes,\nafter which I'll have something to say to you.\" It was a clever\napproach to insure that the audience didn't switch programs.\n\n\"Dan Merrol, this is a personal message to you.\" Merrol sat up.\n\n\"We'd call you if we could, but this is a large city and you've simply\nvanished. We have operatives trying to trace you, but with no success\nup to now.\" The announcer leaned forward confidentially.\n\n\"Now, Dan, before you become alarmed, let me say you've done nothing\nwrong. In fact, at _Interplanet_, we think you've done everything\nright--but I'll come to that later.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInterplanet? Then it wasn't the hospital or the police. What could I.\nP. want of him?\n\n\"No doubt the test you took was somewhat of a shock. Don't blame the\npsych examiner for the conclusions he formed--he can't be expected to\nknow more than the leading psychologists. You're probably curious as\nto what this test has to do with you and _Interplanet_. We hope so--we\nwant you to keep on listening.\n\n\"The test proved you're no longer a competent pilot--but it also\nindicated something much bigger. Dan, _you_ are the answer to a problem\nthat has been bothering us for generations. Before the accident, you\nknew nothing of music or any life science, your math was adequate but\nnot deep, you often felt awkward in the presence of others when you had\nno need to and you lacked confidence in your physical ability.\n\n\"Suddenly, you gained something of each and, when we contacted your\ndoctors, we were able to surmise how it happened. Now you ask--what\ngood does this do you and what is the problem to which this is the\nanswer?\n\n\"Simply this--_specialization_. You know what constitutes a rocket\ncrew--pilot, radio man, engineer and several lesser technicians, each\nof whom knows only his own job. Although you'll never sit at the\ncontrols again--through you, we can help others.\"\n\nThe announcer lowered his voice now. \"You can unlock specialization\nfor us. In the future, each man will concentrate on what particular\naptitudes he has, then share it, via surgery, with others whose\nknowledge complements his own. To do this, we need to study you further\nand, of course, we'll pay you well for the opportunity. In addition,\nyou'll still get your compensation. Please come and talk it over with\nus.\n\n\"Frankly, we're a little worried about what you may be thinking. If\nyou have any thoughts of self-destruction because of what must seem a\nstrange condition, put them aside. You're much saner than the average\nman.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMerrol listened, smiling at the remark. No matter what they thought, he\ncouldn't seriously contemplate suicide. There were too many others to\ndissuade him.\n\nNevertheless, it was hard to understand and accept the sudden change of\nhis status. He had formerly been a mere employee, but now....\n\nThe announcer hadn't finished. \"In the beginning, Dan, I said you had\ndone everything right, whether you knew it or not. After we learned\nwhat we did from your test, we checked through our files and found\nthat we had a few other accident cases on record in which part of\nthe brain had been replaced. In each case there was a faint trace of\nanother personality, which we could detect when we knew what to look\nfor. We rechecked each person we could locate. Unfortunately, the\nlatent personalities and their share of knowledge had been submerged\nbeyond recovery by the rigorous psychotherapy the accident victim had\nundergone after surgery.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe imaginary Wysocki's theorem of self-therapy. He never knew of\nanyone by that name, nor had he got it from one of the other five. But,\nhowever nonsensically he had invented it to express the needs he felt\nat the time, it was, in fact, not nonsense. When it came to that, who\nknew anything about six minds packaged together--and what could have\nbeen done to him in ignorance?\n\nThe announcer was finished talking to Dan Merrol alone. \"Remember,\nall of you,\" he said briskly. \"This man is neither a criminal\nnor insane. He is extremely withdrawn, as a result of unpleasant\nexperiences. If you can induce him to come to _Interplanet_, or lead\nour representatives to him, you will receive a substantial reward. Here\nis his picture.\"\n\nMerrol turned off the screen and scowled. He didn't like that last.\nHe intended to take their offer, but he wanted to be free to walk\nthe streets. He could settle that easily enough by just calling\n_Interplanet_. They'd send someone down to whisk him away. That would\nsolve all his problems--or would it?\n\nCertainly, it eliminated orientation or any form of psychotherapy.\nAfter what had happened to the others, the psychologists would be\ncontent merely to observe what went on in his mind. They wouldn't want\nto give him much privacy, but he'd have to insist on it. They'd listen.\n\nThis could be just a job, a very good job while it lasted--say three or\nfour years--until they had learned all they need to know. Perhaps there\nwould be other men blended more scientifically than he had been. But he\ncould accumulate enough money to last the rest of his life, or perhaps\nturn his many new talents to something else. There were many things he\nwould like to do, and he was ahead of everyone else now, even though in\nthree or four years he would no longer be unique.\n\nExcept, of course, in his body.\n\nAnd there it was again. Was there nothing he could do to get away from\nit?\n\nHe had no memory of Erica except for the one night, but it was enough\nto convince him. What would their future be like in what was sure to\nfollow? After that broadcast, he would be a person of some note, but\nwould that stop laughter? Would she wait until he left the room before\nshe giggled?\n\nHe'd come to terms with _Interplanet_, but first he had to come to\nterms with himself ... and he hadn't.\n\nHow good was his imaginary Wysocki's theorem? Could it take one last\nextension? He counted what was left of the money Erica had given him.\nIt wasn't much, but with it he could leave the city. And he had to.\n\n\nV\n\nIt was dusk when he slipped out of the room and later still when the\nplane lifted away from the station. It was an ancient jet, long since\nrelegated to cheap overnight service where speed was not a factor and\nprice was.\n\nHe knew he was taking a chance and half expected to be stopped, but\napparently not many people had listened to the broadcast. Casual\nglances slid off him and didn't linger. Partly, he suspected, because\nhe had pulled his hat over his face and thrust his hands in the jacket.\nHe'd gotten away in time, but by the morning there would be people on\nthe streets looking for him.\n\nHe stared at the approximation of a port. When this ship had been\nbuilt, there was some feeling against the practice and so the row of\npicture tubes had been camouflaged as ports in the wall. There was a\nstation selector switch, but none for _on_ or _off_. He glowered at the\npicture at his elbow and turned to the least annoying thing he could\nfind. Across the aisle, there were three other programs he could see\ndistinctly. The one directly opposite was a repeat of the broadcast\nhe had heard a few hours previously. He scowled and looked away. If\nit hadn't been a night plane, in which people sought sleep, he would\ncertainly have been spotted. Apathy was his best protection. He hunched\ndown in his seat and dozed off.\n\nWhen he awakened, the familiar _Interplanet_ program was at his elbow.\nHe reached to change stations, then on impulse let his hand continue\npast the knob until he felt the ash tray. He unfastened the heavy\narticle and poked it through the screen.\n\nThe glass broke, but only a few in the immediate vicinity heard it in\nthe din. To those who stared at him, he presented a view of his back or\nthe profile of his hat. They glanced at him indifferently, then looked\naway. Outside the orifice, where the tube had been in the outer of two\nwalls, was an actual port. He gazed through it contentedly.\n\nA finger tapped him. \"Yes?\" he said in a loud voice.\n\nThe man behind him leaned over. \"I've been riding in this plane once a\nweek for five years. I mean, would you mind if I looked out? I've never\nseen where I'm going.\"\n\n\"Glad to have you.\"\n\nThe man sat beside him and peered wistfully out. Below were lights,\nthe patterns of cities, roads and towns and in the distance the glare\nof furnaces. There was also a current of cold air seeping from the\nspace between the double walls. The man looked, shivered, turned up his\ncollar and finally went back to his seat.\n\nIt was cold, but Merrol remained where he was. There was some\nsatisfaction in asserting himself, but the satisfaction wore off and\nthe cold didn't.\n\nHis attention was caught by the program which was flickering across the\naisle. Doctor Crander--Merrol frowned. Did the hospital want him too?\nHe listened intently. No, they didn't want him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCrander sounded tired. \"This is an emergency appeal and we'll need a\nwide response. We have in our care a person with a serious illness we\ncan't diagnose. With so much interplanetary travel we can't determine\nwhat causes the disease. It may be an organism from a moon of Saturn or\nalmost anything else.\n\n\"Our staff is working at top speed. We feel, if we can keep her alive\nfor one week, she'll be out of danger. That is by no means a certainty,\nbut a reasonably accurate forecast.\n\n\"We have a new theory, largely untested, but we hope it will work.\nEach person differs from the next and though, when we match limbs and\norgans, we try to take this into account, we never quite succeed in\neffecting a perfect biological match. As a result, the character of the\nblood changes, slightly but significantly. It's as if we had lumped\ntogether the various natural immunities of the component bodies and\ncreated an entirely new super-immunity.\"\n\nCrander paused. \"We need persons who have had five or more major\nreplacements. By major, I mean hands, arms, legs or parts of\nthem--nothing so trivial as ears, or a few feet of skin, or three or\nfour fingers.\n\n\"It must be at least five, though more are correspondingly better.\nNothing less--and please don't apply with only a minor replacement. Two\ndonors have volunteered so far and we have fractioned and administered\nthe blood of one with dramatic, if temporary, results. In a few hours,\nwe'll have to use the second. After that, I don't know what we'll do.\"\n\nMerrol stirred. He was deeply suspicious.\n\n\"Here's the woman,\" said Crander. \"She needs your help.\"\n\nThe man across the aisle leaned forward and his head was in front of\nthe picture. Merrol tried to see, but couldn't.\n\n\"It's up to you,\" said Crander as he faded from the screen.\n\nMerrol tapped the man across the aisle. \"Please repeat it.\"\n\nThe man glanced around and saw who it was. \"Aw, you're the guy who\ndoesn't like that stuff.\" He jerked his head at the broken screen.\n\nThe memory cell of the picture tube didn't have a long attention span.\nIt could recall forty-five seconds of the past program and no longer.\nThe broadcast might be repeated, or it might not. Did he want to wait?\n\nHe reached out his arm--the long one--and fastened onto the man's\njacket, giving him a short rough shove.\n\n\"Repeat it, I said!\"\n\nThe man looked down. He wasn't small himself, but it was a large\nfist. \"Sure thing,\" he said, jabbing the repeat button. The scene was\nreplayed.\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Merrol, letting go.\n\nThe man looked at his crumpled clothing. \"Not at all,\" he muttered,\nsliding away against the wall. \"Don't mention it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe woman was Erica. It was too much of a coincidence that, among so\nmany millions in the city, she should be the one. The hospital and\n_Interplanet_ were working together and now they had brought in Erica.\nHow gullible did they think he was and how much had they offered her\nfor this? It might not be money, though--they might have convinced\nher it was to Dan's own best interest that they get in touch with him\nimmediately.\n\nThey were baiting him crudely and if they weren't, there were others\nwho could respond as well as he. There must be hundreds in the\nvicinity, scores at any rate, who could qualify. There were enough\nwithout him, depending on how often the blood fraction was needed.\nCrander hadn't said. It was a trick and Erica wasn't ill--or if she\nwas, she would be safe without him. He had to make up his mind before\nhe saw her, and he couldn't. He clenched his hands, both big and\nlittle. He had stretched Wysocki's theorem too far and it had failed.\n\n\"I had a wife once.\" The voice startled him, but he sat still, hoping\nto hear it again. Maybe they would tell him what to do. \"Not so slender\nas Erica. Rather bouncy, in fact, but I liked her. Pity she ran away\nwith a coleopterist. Never could understand what she saw in him.\" The\nvoice grew sad. \"_Beetles!_\"\n\n\"My advice is that wives are easily come by,\" said a theatrical voice,\nmodulated for effect. \"But before he shuffles off this mortal coil to\nthe last roundup, every man should have at least one wife like Erica.\"\n\n\"I can't speak of wives or women,\" said the musician. \"There's so\nlittle memory left, mostly music. But you've been subconsciously\nhumming a tune for days--and I must tell you that Beethoven didn't\nwrite anything called Erica. The correct title is Eroica.\"\n\n\"One fall don't mean nothing, it's always the best two out of three.\nThe way I see it, you gotta get up. Get close to them, hold them tight,\nor they'll throw you outta the ring.\"\n\n\"This is something that can't be figured. There are some odds no one\ncan live by. You'll have to solve this one yourself.\"\n\nHe sat there, not moving. They were with him always, but sometimes they\nweren't much help.\n\nThe plane would land on the other side of the continent. He had little\nmoney, but he could get in touch with _Interplanet_ and they would\nadvance him the fare back. Unfortunately, such a move would take time.\nThere would be schedules to juggle, to say nothing of the ride back. A\nmere matter of hours on a fast ship--yet what if that was too long?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe got to his feet and went forward. \"You can't go in there,\" said the\nstewardess.\n\nHe looked past her into the pilot's compartment. It was securely locked\nfrom this side though not on the other. He glanced down at the girl.\nIt was a tradition that stewardesses were gorgeous creatures, though\nthe tradition was simply not true any longer. In an age of space\nexploration, air travel had dispensed with glamor. But for unfathomable\nreasons, this stewardess was a throwback to the old days. If she didn't\nquite achieve real beauty, she came close enough so that no healthy\nmale could conceivably object to her nearness.\n\nMerrol could take the keys away from her, but she'd scream and a dozen\nmen would come leaping to her rescue. He didn't care for the odds.\n\nHe had met three women and had he misjudged the effect of the\nnew himself on them? First Erica--her behavior had been strange,\nconsidering that, even from the first, she must have doubted he\nwas her husband. Then the receptionist--she _had_ gone out of her\nway to get him into Crander's office when the latter was upset by\nthe disappearance of a patient. And finally, the pathetic Miss\nJerrems, who had thawed and would have descended to crooked schemes,\nhad he encouraged her. Was this some form of pity or something\nquite different--or did it matter at all as long as they were not\nindifferent? There was a way to find out.\n\nHe raised his arm, the shorter one, and laid his hand affectionately on\nthe stewardess' shoulder. \"Isn't there a private room in back?\"\n\nShe tilted her head and her lips glistened. \"Yes, there is.\"\n\n\"Small enough for two?\"\n\n\"I believe so.\" Her lashes trembled and lowered and she seemed\nsurprised that they did. \"That is if you--if we snuggled close.\"\n\n\"I'm sure we will. Why don't you find out about that room?\"\n\n\"It seems like a good idea.\" She blushed and turned to leave.\n\n\"I'll need keys, won't I?\" he said.\n\nShe leaned against him and the keys dropped into his hand. \"I'll be\nwaiting,\" she whispered. He watched her walk down the aisle and enjoyed\nthe enticing sway of her hips. Under other circumstances, he might\nhave considered joining her.\n\nHe had the keys! It had worked! He didn't know why, nor did he have\ntime to think about it. He inserted the key and stepped inside.\n\n\"Hi, Jane,\" sang out the pilot, not turning, assuming he knew who it\nwas.\n\nMerrol located the autopilot switch and, reaching past the man, turned\nit on. With the same motion he whirled the pilot around. \"Listen,\nfriend, don't you want to go back?\"\n\n\"No. Why should I?\" The pilot was startled, but not intimidated.\n\n\"Engine trouble or something. You figure it out. I don't care\nwhat it is, as long as we get back.\" He half-hoped the man would\nobject--physical action would be a relief. In an emergency, he could\nhandle the ship himself--it was simpler than a spaceship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe pilot squinted beyond and behind him. \"Engines don't sound so\ngood,\" he muttered. He was unexpectedly docile. \"Safety first is the\nmotto of this airline.\" It was a good rule, but it was questionable\nwhose safety he was referring to.\n\nThe pilot was still having unaccountable difficulty with his\neyes--there was a marked tendency to cross. \"Sure, we'll go back,\" he\nsaid. \"Glad you brought it to my attention. But call off your gang,\nwill you, mister?\"\n\nMerrol turned around. He was alone. There was no one behind him, though\nthe pilot seemed convinced there was.\n\nHe had a partial answer to the pilot's strange reaction. He was a\nmultiple personality and, normally latent, in times of stress the\nmulti-personality became dominant and impressed itself psychologically\non the observer. And if the mind received the impression of several\nmen, the eye tried hard to produce evidence that would confirm it.\n\nNot everyone was as successful at self-hypnosis as the pilot, but\nthe temptation toward it was always there. Now that he thought of\nit, men never had laughed at him. Instead they had been respectful.\nHe apparently had an unsettling effect on those of his own sex he\ncame in contact with--just how powerful it was, he didn't know yet.\nThe complete answer would have to await investigation by trained\npsychologists.\n\nWomen were different. They invariably laughed first--Erica too, in\nspite of the general sympathy she must have felt for him. In what did\nthe difference lie? That too he would have to determine--later.\n\nThe pilot looked at him dizzily, beseechingly. Merrol decided he must\nbe pouring it on, though he felt no different. \"Remember, I can get up\nhere in an awful hurry,\" said Merrol, \"so no tricks.\" The pilot nodded\nand clung helplessly to the controls. He wouldn't cause any trouble.\nMerrol raised his arm in a gesture. \"Come on, fellows.\"\n\nAs an afterthought, he locked the stewardess in the private compartment\nand, as he did so, he could feel the plane swing in a wide arc that\nwould take them to the station they had started from. The apathetic\ndozing passengers didn't even notice.\n\nAnd then all six of him walked back to his seat and Merrol sat down.\n\n\nVI\n\nHe slid out of the plane while it was still rolling. He didn't want to\nargue with the passengers, when they found they were on the wrong coast\nand he was to blame. Nor did he particularly want to explain to the\nauthorities. Later he would have to, but by then he would have powerful\ninterests behind him to smooth over the incident.\n\nIt was late and there were no cabs in sight, in air or on surface. He\ncrossed the landing strip into the station and out of it and swept\nalong the dark streets with a loose-jointed stride that made the\ndistance seem less than it was. Presently, he broke into a trot and his\nspeed was encouraging.\n\nA hoppicopter--one of the little surface cars that could rise and\nfly for a short time to avoid traffic jams--bounced down and rolled\nalongside. A window slid open and a head popped out. \"In a hurry,\nmister?\"\n\nHe bobbed his head. \"Hospital.\"\n\n\"Jump in and we'll take you. We're not doing anything special--just\nriding around.\" The hoppicopter stopped. This was luck--he'd get there\nfaster.\n\nThe man in the front seat opened the door and stepped out, flashing a\nlight on him. \"Just a check. We don't mind taking you, but we want to\nbe sure we don't pick up some rough character.\"\n\nThe man didn't look so gentle himself--and the light was trained on Dan\ntoo long. If they were afraid, he'd have to refuse their offer and go\non.\n\n\"Hey, Carl,\" the man with the flash called out puzzledly. \"Haven't we\nseen this guy somewhere before?\"\n\nHe should have expected something like this and not stopped--but maybe\nit would have been worse if he hadn't. So far, he had been lucky that\nno one had spotted him--and now was not the time to be discussing\nterms with _Interplanet_. He began to edge away.\n\nCarl climbed out of the hoppicopter and circled in the same direction\nMerrol was inching toward. \"I guess I have at that,\" said Carl slowly.\nHe was a big man. \"Can't say where, though.\"\n\nMerrol breathed more easily. He couldn't make a break for it, but\nperhaps he wouldn't have to. They might not have seen the broadcast.\n\"I've got to hurry,\" he said. \"I'll go on.\"\n\n\"Don't get sore,\" said Carl soothingly. \"We'll take you. Climb in.\"\n\nThe man with the light was frowning indecisively. \"The guy on the\nbroadcast?\" he asked sharply.\n\n\"Nah,\" said Carl disgustedly. \"That guy--you look at his picture and\nyou have to bust out laughing. Now this fellow here--while he's a\nlong way from handsome--is clearly the executive type, a man you can\ntrust.\" Carl scrutinized him thoughtfully. Before Merrol could stop\nhim, he reached out and plucked off the hat. \"There's only one guy with\nthree-colored hair, though, and you've got it,\" he said unbelievingly.\n\nMerrol started to back away, but the body of the hoppicopter stopped\nhim.\n\n\"Mister, you've sure got some disguise,\" said the other man in an awed\nvoice. \"I could look right at you all day and not tell who it was.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was no disguise, it was the multi-personality again. No one looked\nquite the same in real life as in a picture, because the personality\nwas missing. And with him the difference was far more marked. The\ncamera could register his features accurately, but men couldn't, not\nwhen he was actually there to inspire trust and respect--and he did\narouse those emotions. Added together, these were some of the reasons\nwhy he hadn't hitherto been recognized.\n\n\"Sorry to have bothered you,\" he said, pushing between them as they\nconverged on him. \"I'm in a hurry.\"\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" said Carl, apologetically, moving aside.\n\n\"But he's money!\" the man with the flashlight cried in an anguished\nvoice.\n\n\"So he is!\" said Carl. The vision of money seemed to carry a lot of\nweight with him. He seemed reluctant to act, but he reached out and\nswung Merrol around. \"We'll take you to _Interplanet_ and then you can\ngo to the hospital. Don't worry, we aren't going to do nothing. It\ndon't _pay_ us to hurt you.\"\n\nTheir original intentions were probably sincere, but now that they\nthought they'd found money on the street, they weren't willing to let\nit go. But Merrol was not going to accompany them to _Interplanet_. He\njerked away.\n\n\"We'll split the reward,\" said Carl. \"Too bad we got to carry him in.\"\n\nMerrol tried to elude him, but Carl caught his arm in a bone-cracking\nhold. That is, it ought to have splintered bone. That it didn't was not\ndue to lack of skill, but to the proportions of the arm to which it was\napplied. The advantage of leverage went to Merrol and he used it. He\nbroke loose and swung the long arm with the large fist and Carl went\ndown.\n\nThe man with the light dropped it, climbed on Merrol's back and was\npounding away at a nerve. Had he found the nerve, Merrol might have\ncrumpled to the street. He didn't find it, because it wasn't there. The\nnerve had been surgically rerouted.\n\nMerrol peeled him off and tossed him on top of Carl. He tossed him\nharder than he meant to and neither man moved.\n\nHe climbed into the hoppicopter and rolled it through the dark streets.\nThey had caused him to lose time and for this they would forfeit the\nuse of their 'copter. They could pick it up in the morning, if they\nfelt like claiming it. He got out and hurried into the hospital.\n\nHe met others in the corridors--it was a busy place in spite of the\nlateness--but the first person he recognized was Erica. \"Dan!\" she\nsaid. She didn't use anything scientific, but the hold on him was\nharder to break than judo. Perhaps because he didn't want to.\n\nLater, he became aware of someone tapping his shoulder. He turned\naround. \"These things can be consummated in the privacy of one's own\nhome,\" murmured Doctor Crander. \"But when a life is at stake, passion\nshould be put aside.\"\n\nThe purely physical elation began to fade. He put Erica down, but\nuncertainly holding onto her. It was an ambivalent gesture. \"Is this\nwhat you call an emergency?\" he asked sarcastically. He had broken a\nnumber of minor laws and nearly his own neck in getting here. He had a\nright to be angry, though he was not sure how he felt.\n\nThe doctor gave him a scandalized look. \"Do you think we're unethical?\nThere is such a woman as we described, one of our staff. We do have\nother donors, but we think you can do more for her. In a fit of\ndespondency, this woman wandered into the extraterrestrial room without\nthe customary protection, hoping to catch something--and she did.\"\nCrander frowned. \"The only way we altered facts was to use your wife's\nphoto. It was her idea. Furthermore, it is true that a pretty girl gets\na better response--and, of course, Erica wanted you back.\"\n\nWhen he learned who the patient was, he was satisfied with his\ndecision. After the blood fraction had been administered to Miss\nJerrems, even his untrained eyes could see the improvement.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe watched Erica suspiciously as she pattered about in a state of\ndishabille that did nothing to enhance her beauty but, perversely,\nmade her more exciting. That she had been uncertain as to his identity\nthe last time meant little and he could forgive it. Man and wife were\nnot thereby distinct species, separate to themselves, unattracted or\nrepelled by all others of the opposite sex. For himself, he had only to\nremember the stewardess.\n\nBut it was important to know what her true feelings toward him were.\nLaughter at the wrong time could be disastrous to a man's ego!\n\n\"This time, you know there's no mistake,\" he said, hoping that irony\nwas some protection. \"But are you sure you want me as a husband?\"\n\nShe stopped fiddling with her hair. She tilted her head and looked\nat him, at a body that defied the laws of anatomy and the face that\nbelonged on a clown--except that a clown could take his face off. \"Are\nyou trying to get rid of me?\" She was asking questions, not answering\nthem.\n\nErica was examining him carefully and he could tell that she, unlike a\nmale, saw each feature distinctly, saw the nose that had belonged to\nsomeone else and looked it, the jaw, originally very fine, but with\ncontours that had since melted out of shape.\n\n\"I'm not trying to get rid of you,\" he said. \"Maybe you want somebody\nnicer.\" He'd have to know before he could stop feeling tormented.\n\n\"Nicer?\" she echoed. \"Do you want me to answer that?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe came and leaned against him. \"A woman ought to have _some_\nsecrets,\" she murmured. \"But if you have to know, the first time I\nsaw you I laughed, because you are funny. And after that, well, I saw\ntraces of the nicest features of nearly every man I ever had a crush\non. That was just the physical side.\"\n\nShe rested her head on his shoulder. \"I didn't believe you actually\nwere Dan. I didn't pay attention to a thing you said.\"\n\n\"But if you didn't believe....\"\n\n\"Just what you're thinking,\" she answered. \"I couldn't help it. You're\nthe most exciting challenge a woman can have. Even if she doesn't know\nwhy, as I didn't then, it's still there--half a dozen men, and all of\nthem in one monogamous package.\"\n\nNow that she put it that way, he could see why she hadn't been able to\nresist. He could see that there were few women who could. He glanced at\na framed photograph of the handsome pre-accident Dan Merrol that stood\non the bureau. He thought, _Poor sucker!_\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Man Who Was Six, by F. L.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
