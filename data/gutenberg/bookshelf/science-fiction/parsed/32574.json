Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the\nU.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n[Sidenote: Langston had technicolor delusions; inanimate objects came\nalive in his hands; THEY were persecuting him, out to get him ... what a\nrelief it was to know he wasn't going insane!]\n\n\nWhen I saw the blood dripping from the tap in the bathtub, I knew that\nsomeone had a telenosis beam on me, and I breathed a very audible sigh\nof relief.\n\nDuring the past few days, I had begun to wonder if I was really cracking\nup.\n\nWhen you start seeing visions of a bearded gent with a halo, or having\nvague but wonderful dreams about some sort of perfect world, feeling\nintense loyalties to undefined ideals, and experiencing sudden impulses,\nsometimes cruel and sometimes kind--you know that something's wrong.\n\nAt least I do.\n\nIf he--whoever he was--had just kept up the slow, subtle pace he'd\nmaintained for the past two or three days, he would have had me in a\nlittle while. For whatever he wanted.\n\nBut now, he'd overplayed his hand. I knew, at least, what was going on.\nWho was doing it, or why, I still didn't know--nor whether I could stand\nit, even knowing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe thick, bright red blood dripping steadily from the water tap in the\nbath tub wasn't so bad.\n\nI stood before the mirror, with my softly humming razor in my hand, and\nI watched the blood ooze from the tap, quiver as it grew heavy and\npregnant, then pull itself free and fall with a dull _plonk_ to the\nenamel as another drop began to form.\n\nThat wasn't so bad. But my sigh of relief became a gurgle of almost\nhysterical apprehension as I braced myself for what might come, with the\ntelenizer knowing that I was aware.\n\nThere was something I could do--should do--but my mind refused to focus.\nIt bogged down in a muck of unreasoning terror and could only scream\n_Why? Why? Why?_\n\nThe drops of blood from the water tap increased both in size and\nrapidity, as I watched. Heavy, red, marble-sized tears followed one\nanother from the tap, _plonk, plonk, plonk_, splashing in the tub and on\nthe floor. Faster and faster, and then the drip became a flow, a gush,\nas though the vein of some giant creature had been slashed.\n\nThe tub filled rapidly, and blood flowed like a crimson waterfall over\nthe edge and across the floor toward me.\n\nI heard a tiny howling, and looked down.\n\nI screamed and threw the soft, brown, fuzzy, squirming puppy-thing that\nhad been a razor into the advancing tide of blood.\n\nThe fuzzy thing shattered when it hit the blood, and each of the\nthousand pieces became another tiny puppy-thing that grew and grew,\nyapping and swimming in the blood. The tide was now rising about my\nshoes.\n\nI backed away from the mirror, trembling violently. I forced myself to\nslosh through the thick blood into the bedroom, groping for a bottle of\nwhisky on the bureau.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What the hell are you doing here?\" the boss asked when I opened his\noffice door and peeked in. \"You're supposed to be in Palm Beach. Well,\ndamn it, come on in!\"\n\nI clung to the door firmly as I maneuvered myself through the opening.\nAnd when I closed the door, I leaned back against it heavily.\n\nI could see the boss--Carson Newell, managing editor of Intergalaxy News\nService--half rising from behind his big desk across the room; but he\nwas pretty dim and I couldn't get him to stay in one place. His voice\nwas clear enough, though:\n\n\"Must be mighty important to bring you back from.... Damn it, Langston,\nare you drunk?\"\n\nI grinned then, and said, \"Carshon. Carton. Old boy. Do you know that\ntelenosis therapy is no sonofabitchin' good on alcoholics?\"\n\nCarson Newell sat back down, frowning.\n\nI stumbled to a chair by the corner of his desk and gripped the arms\ntightly.\n\n\"Telenosis therapy,\" I repeated, \"is just no--\"\n\n\"Snap out of it,\" Newell barked. \"It's no good on dumb animals, either,\nand you're probably out of range by now, anyway.\"\n\nHe took a small bottle from his desk and tossed a yellow Anti-Alch pill\nacross the desk to me. I popped it into my mouth.\n\nIt didn't take long to work. A few minutes later, still weak and a\nlittle trembly, I said, \"Would have thought of that myself, if I hadn't\nbeen so damn drunk.\"\n\nThe boss grunted. \"Now what's this business about telenosis?\"\n\n\"Somebody's been using it on me,\" I said. \"Maliciously. Damn near\ndrowned in a lake of blood from a water faucet.\"\n\n\"Couldn't have been DTs?\"\n\n\"I'm serious. It's been going on for three or four days now. Not the\nblood. That's what gave it away. But other things.\"\n\n\"You've been working pretty hard lately,\" Newell reminded me.\n\n\"Which is why I'm on vacation and all nice and relaxed. Or at least, I\n_was_. No, it's not that. Listen, Carson, I admit that I'm no technical\nexpert on telenosis. But a long time ago--seven or eight years ago, I\nguess--I did a feature series on it. I learned a little bit. Enough to\nsave my life this time.\"\n\nNewell shrugged. \"Okay. You probably know more about it than I do. I\njust know it's damned restricted stuff.\" He paused thoughtfully. \"Any\nmissing telenizer equipment would cause a helluva fuss, and there hasn't\nbeen any fuss.\"\n\n\"No machines in Palm Beach or vicinity that somebody on the inside could\nbe using illegally?\" And then I answered that question myself: \"No ... I\ndoubt it. The machines are used only in the larger hospitals.\"\n\n\"Don't suppose you have any hunches?\"\n\nI shook my head slowly, frowning. \"You couldn't really call it a hunch.\nJust a bare possibility. But I noticed on a news report the other day\nthat Isaac Grogan--you know, 'the Millionaire Mayor of Memphis,'\nreleased about a month ago, bribery and corruption sentence--anyway,\nhe's taken up temporary residence in Palm Beach.\"\n\nThe boss rubbed his chin. \"As I recall, you did an expos\u00e9 series on him\nfour or five years ago. Corroborated by official investigation, and\nGrogan was later sentenced. You thinks he's after revenge?\"\n\nI raised a hand warningly. \"Now, hold on--I said it was a bare\npossibility. All I know is that Grogan hates my guts--or might think he\nhas some reason to. I know that Grogan is in Palm Beach, and that I've\nbeen under telenosis attack. There's no necessary connection at all.\"\n\n\"No,\" Newell said. \"But it's something to start on.\" He looked at his\nwrist watch. \"Tell you what. It's nearly noon now. Let's go out for\nlunch, and while I'm thinking, you can tell me all you remember about\ntelenosis.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt's altogether possible that you may have no more than barely heard of\ntelenosis--its technical details are among the most closely guarded\nsecrets of our time. So I'll go over some of the high spots of what I\ntold Newell.\n\nMind you, I'm no authority on the subject, and it has been a full seven\nyears since I have done any research on it. However, I learned all I\nknow from Dr. Homer Reighardt, who, at the time, was the world's\noutstanding authority.\n\nTelenosis, nowadays, is confined almost exclusively to use in\npsychiatric hospitals and corrective institutions. It's used chiefly on\nneurotics. In cases of extreme dementia, it's worthless. In fact, the\nmore normal you are, the more effective the telenosis.\n\nRoughly--without going into any of the real technicalities--it's this\nway:\n\nScience has known for a long time that electrical waves emanate from the\nbrain. The waves can be measured on an electroencaphalograph, and vary\nwith the physiological and psychological condition of the individual.\nExtreme paranoia, for example, or epilepsy, or alcoholism are\naccompanied by violent disturbances of the waves.\n\nVery interesting, but....\n\nIt wasn't until 2037 that Professor Martin James decided that these\nbrain waves are comparable to radio waves, and got busy inventing a\ndevice to listen in on them.\n\nThe result, of course, was telenosis. The machine that James came up\nwith, after twenty years of work, could not only listen in on a person's\nthoughts, which are carried on the brain waves, but it could transmit\nmessages to the brain from the outside.\n\n\"Unless the waves are in a state of disturbance caused by alcohol or\ninsanity or some such thing?\" Newell commented.\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"The word 'telenosis' comes from 'hypnosis,' doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, but not very accurately,\" I said. \"In hypnosis, you need some sort\nof visual or auditory accompaniment. With telenosis, you can gain\ncontrol of a person's mind directly, through the brain waves.\"\n\n\"You say 'gain control of a person's mind,'\" Newell said. \"Do you mean\nthat if you tell someone who is under telenosis to do something, he's\ngot to do it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Not necessarily,\" I said. \"All you can do with telenosis is transmit\nthoughts to a person--counting visual and auditory sensations as\nthoughts. If you can convince him that the thoughts you're sending are\n_his_ thoughts ... then you can make him do almost anything. But if he\nknows or suspects he's being telenized--\"\n\n\"I'm with you,\" Newell interrupted. \"He still gets the thoughts--visions\nand sounds or what have you--but he doesn't have to obey them.\"\n\nI nodded. My mind was skipping ahead to more immediate problems. \"Don't\nyou suppose we ought to notify Central Investigation Division right\naway? This is really a problem for them.\"\n\nBut Newell was there ahead of me. \"So was the Memphis affair,\" he said.\n\nI raised my eyebrows.\n\n\"Meaning,\" the boss continued, \"that I'd like to give your hunch a play\nfirst.\"\n\n\"But it's not even a hunch,\" I objected. \"How?\"\n\n\"Well, by having you interview Grogan, for instance....\"\n\nI opened my mouth and almost shook my head, but Newell hurried on.\n\"Look, Earl, it's been a long time since Intergalaxy has scored a good\nnews beat. Not since the Memphis expos\u00e9, in fact. Remember that?\nRemember how good it felt to have your name on articles published all\nover the world? Remember all the extra cash? The fame?\"\n\nI grunted.\n\n\"Now before you say anything,\" Newell said, \"remember that when you\nstarted on that case you didn't have a thing more concrete to go on than\nyou have right now--just a half a hunch. Isn't that right? Admit it!\"\n\n\"M'm.\"\n\n\"Well, isn't it worth a chance? What can we lose?\"\n\n\"Me, maybe. But....\"\n\nThe boss said nothing more. He knew that if he let me do the talking,\nI'd soon argue myself into it. Which I did.\n\nFive minutes later, I shrugged. \"Okay. What, specifically, do you have\nin mind?\"\n\n\"Let's go back to the office,\" Newell said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was just a short walk. Or, I should say, it would have been a short\nwalk, if we had walked.\n\nBut New York was one of the very last cities to convert to the \"level\"\ntransportation system. It had been one hell of an engineering feat, but\nfor Amerpean ingenuity and enterprise nothing is impossible, so the job\nhad finally been tackled and completed just within the past year. And\nthe novelty of the ambulator bands on pedestrian levels was still strong\nfor native New Yorkers.\n\nSo instead of leaving the restaurant on the vehicle level, where we\nhappened to be, and taking an old fashioned sidewalk stroll to the IGN\nbuilding, Newell insisted on taking the escalator up to the next level\nand then gliding along on an amband.\n\nThat's just the sort of person he is.\n\nWhen we got back up to his office, he asked, \"Isn't there some sort of\ndefense against telenosis? I mean, other than alcohol or insanity?\"\n\nI thought for a moment. \"Shouldn't be too hard to devise one. All you\nneed is something to set up interference vibrations on the same band as\nthe brain waves you're guarding.\"\n\n\"Sounds simple as hell. Could one of our men do it?\"\n\n\"A telenosis technician at one of the hospitals could do it quicker,\" I\nsuggested.\n\n\"Without the sanction of C.I.D.? I doubt that.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" I agreed. \"Okay. I'll run down to Technology and see\nwhat we can work out. It may take two or three days--\"\n\n\"I'll see that it gets top priority. I want you to get back to Palm\nBeach as soon as you can.\"\n\nAs I was getting up to leave, Newell said, \"Say, by the way, how's that\nhealth cult in Palm Beach--Suns-Rays Incorporated? Anything on that?\"\n\nSuns-Rays Incorporated was one of the chief reasons I was taking my\nvacation in Palm Beach, Fla., instead of in Sacramento, Calif., my home\ntown. Carson Newell had heard about this crackpot religious group that\nwas having a convention in Palm Beach, and he couldn't see why one of\nhis reporters shouldn't combine business and pleasure.\n\nAnd maybe that tells you a little more of the sort of person he is.\n\n\"It's a complete fraud,\" I told him. \"They worship a glorified sunlamp\nand take regular treatments. Same time, they follow a strict diet and\nsystem of exercises--have their own little spot on one of the beaches.\nGuaranteed to cure what ails you.\"\n\n\"Who's the head?\" Newell asked. \"How many are there?\"\n\n\"About twenty-five or thirty members, I'd say. That's not counting the\nfew curiosity-seekers, like me. And nobody in particular seems to be in\ncharge right now. I guess the big boss died, and they're holding this\nconfab to elect a new one. Supposed to have the elections today, come to\nthink of it. There's a great big scoop I missed.\"\n\n\"Any real news value in it?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Feature story, maybe, but it's pretty run-of-the-mill\nstuff, even at that.\"\n\n\"Well, stay with it,\" Newell said. \"Just in case nothing pops on this\ntelenosis deal. And get that defense mech as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Do I get a real vacation after this is all over?\" I asked, knowing what\nthe answer would be.\n\n\"Scram,\" Newell replied. \"I'm a busy man. Get going!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLate afternoon of the next day, my defense mechanism was ready. They had\ntaken a reading of my brain wave with a makeshift electroencaphalograph,\nand then a couple of electronics boys had tinkered around until they had\na gadget that would throw out vibrations on exactly my wave-band.\n\nOf course, not having any telenosis equipment, we weren't able to make a\nreal check of the contraption's effectiveness. I had to take the\ntechnologists' word that it would work.\n\nFrankly, I didn't feel any too well defended as I hopped the five\no'clock stratoliner back to Palm Beach.\n\nThe defense mech was enclosed in a black case that looked like a\nportable radio or a portable typewriter or a small suitcase. When you\nopened the lid, there was a flat surface having only one dial--for\nvolume. The vibrations had a radius of about three-quarters of a mile.\n\nIt was after six when I got back to my hotel. I had Grogan's address,\nand he wasn't too far from where I was staying--but Grogan is not the\nsort of person on whom you make a business call after business hours.\n\nMy confidence in the defense mech hadn't grown, but I knew of another\nsure-fire defense, so after dinner I went to the bar to start setting it\nup.\n\nBut I lugged the thirty-pound portable along, anyway, wishing that it\nlooked a little more like a briefcase instead of a typewriter or a\nradio.\n\nNot that it really mattered, though. I could have carried an open bird\ncage with a live and screaming Calypsian _grimp_, odor and all, and\nstill not have attracted any attention--because it wouldn't have been\nany more unusual than some of the guests at the hotel.\n\nFor a student of interplanetary biology, this would be a perfect\nobservation post. There aren't many forms of extraterrestrial life that\ncan accommodate themselves to Earth's conditions, but there are spots\nthat go out of their way to provide suitable conditions for anything\nthat comes along, and this was one of them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the two weeks I had been here, I had seen only one Calypsian\ndominant, and he didn't happen to have a _grimp_ with him. But there\nwere a pair of Uranian _galgaque_--squat, gray, midget honeymooners--who\nsmelled just as bad. They left a few days after I got here.\n\nThen there had been at least half a dozen flimsy, ethereal little\nVenusians at one time or another, dragging themselves around and looking\nunhappy as hell. None of them stayed more than a few days, and they\nspent most of their time in the water.\n\nI noticed one or two hairy, apelike dominants from Jupiter's third moon,\nand a few of the snaky, scaly, six-limbed creatures from the second. In\naddition, there was a group of Vega VI dominants who were hard to\ndistinguish from humans if you didn't look closely enough to notice\ntheir complete hairlessness and the absence of neck.\n\nAnd of course there were the inevitable Martians--giant, big-chested,\nspindly-limbed, red-hued parodies of humanity; friendly, good-natured\nand alert. But I don't really suppose they should be classed among the\noddities of the place.\n\nAs one of my colleagues commented in a national publication not long\nago: \"The only place a Martian is a novelty any more is on Mars.\"\n\nI fully expect the 2080 census to show a Martian population on Earth\nmore than double that of the home planet. So far, the Martians seem to\nbe the only extraterrestrials who've really taken root here. And that's\na problem, too.\n\nBut how the hell did I get off on that?\n\n[Illustration]\n\nI was finishing my second martini, sitting in a booth with my feet\npropped on the seat opposite me and catching snatches of a conversation\nbetween an Earth girl and a Vega VI Romeo at a nearby table. It was\npretty unsavory conversation, and I guess I was shaking my head sternly\nwhen a shadow fell over me.\n\n\"Another of the same,\" I said, looking up--but it wasn't the waiter.\n\nIt was an enormous, red-skinned, balloon-chested, white-togaed Martian,\nand his little wrinkled face was smiling like I was long-lost Uncle\nEddie whom he hadn't seen for forty years. When he threw open his long,\nspindly arms and screeched a loud, \"Ahh!\" I was beginning to think maybe\nI was.\n\n\"Mr. Langston!\" he shrilled. \"How gladly to see you! Where been? We\nmissing you colossal!\" Then he slapped one fragile hand against his\nprotruding chest, looked up at the ceiling and squeaked: \"Clean living\nand Suns-Rays Incorporated!\" He looked at me again, smiling.\n\n\"Huh?\" I said. \"Oh, yeah. Sure as hell. Clean living and Suns-Rays\netcetera. Damn right. Pull up a chair, Blek, old boy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, one Martian looks pretty much like another; but\nnow I recognized this one. There was only one extraterrestrial in the\nlittle screwball health-cult with which I had become rather loosely\nacquainted in the past two weeks, and this was him.\n\nI moved my feet and Zan Matl Blekeke sat down, exuding sunshine and\nclean living all over the place. We ordered drinks. He was elated as\nblazes about something, and I decided I might as well let him tell me\nabout it--and knowing the typical Martian's haphazard use of the English\nlanguage, I regarded the prospect as something of a challenge.\n\nZan Blekeke started right in telling me about it in his shrill, piping\ntones:\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Langston, wrong time go. Where been? Should have been meeting.\nI derelicted resident. Ha! Expected, yups?\"\n\nI replied, \"Nups. Let's start over again. Something pretty damn\nimportant?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"SRI meeting? Yesterday?\"\n\nHe nodded again, smiling to beat hell.\n\nI thought for a moment, then tried a shot in the dark, illogical as it\nwas. \"You lost your home? Derelicted resident?\"\n\nHe looked like I'd stepped on his sore corn.\n\nI tried again. \"You don't mean you were kicked out of the group?\"\n\nHe winced. \"Oohhh, nooo! Opposition. Opposition.\"\n\n\"You mean there was too much opposition to your being kicked out, so you\nweren't?\"\n\nHe slumped in his seat and regarded me balefully. With the pathos of a\nsqueaky hinge, he said:\n\n\"Head man. Top dog. Derelicted resident. Boss. Wheel. Me. Zan Blekeke.\"\n\nAnd if I didn't get it now, I just didn't deserve to know. But I got it.\n\n\"You were elected president?\" I said.\n\nZan Blekeke nodded gratefully. \"Yus and so. Undeserving awful, but....\"\nHe heaved his chest in resignation.\n\n\"No. Not at all,\" I protested. \"Why, I think that's wonderful. You're\njust the man for the job! Have another drink.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe ordered more drinks, and the Martian continued: \"Membership\nobviousless that whatsoever I closest intimute of Dear Late Doctor--\"\nhere he raised his eyes again and clapped a hand to his chest before he\nfinished--\"I should wallow in step-tracks.\"\n\n\"Why, absolutely,\" I agreed emphatically. \"No question about it.\"\n\nFrom talking to some of the SRI members after meetings or at beach\nsessions, I had gained the definite impression that Zan Blekeke had been\na sort of a servant to \"Dear Late Doctor,\" and would continue to be a\nservant to whoever was elected in his place.\n\nBut instead, they had elected the Martian himself. Logical, in a\ncockeyed way.\n\nThis was the first time I'd ever really talked to him. I'd seen him at\nthe few meetings of SRI I had attended, but he had seemed pretty quiet\nthere, letting others do most of the talking. He was in charge of\nadministering the daily Sun-Ray treatments, which I had taken once or\ntwice myself just for the experience; but on those occasions, he had\nbeen very cold and professional.\n\n_Closest intimute of Dear Late Doctor...._\n\nI had never been able to find out much about the Doctor. He was too\nsacred a subject for any of the members to even talk about. Of course, I\nhadn't tried very hard, because I wasn't especially interested in this\nassignment--I was supposed to be on vacation.\n\nNow that a successor had been chosen, I wondered if the show was over\nand everyone could go home. I asked Blekeke about it.\n\n\"Not while yet,\" he replied. \"Colonial could be. All live one. Dear Late\nDoctor--\" hand to heart, face to Heaven, Amen--\"often told wanted\ncolossal.\"\n\nIt wasn't too clear, but I nodded anyway. Frankly, my interest in the\nwhole thing was at a very low ebb. With the drinks and the effort of\nuntangling Blekeke's twisted English, I was becoming listless and\nsleepy.\n\nBut he insisted on knowing where I had been when the meeting was held. I\ntold him I'd had to hurry back to New York for a conference with my\npublisher.\n\nHe said, \"Ah, yes. Writer.\" He pointed to the defense mech on the seat\nbeside me. \"That typer?\"\n\n\"Huh? Oh, no ... that's a portable radio. Carry it around with me, in\ncase the conversation gets dull.\" I was at the point where I didn't care\nmuch what I said.\n\nHe must have taken it as a gentle hint, because in a little while he got\nup and left, shrilling: \"So gladly seeing you. Wanted know.\"\n\nI nodded and waved a limp hand at him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs I was passing the desk on the way up to my room, the clerk called,\n\"Mr. Langston, Mr. Langston. Long distance call for you, sir. I was just\nringing your room. You can take it in a booth there, if you wish, sir.\"\n\nI nodded and walked to the row of vp booths. Closing the door, I sat\ndown in front of the screen and picked up the mike. The visiphone screen\nlighted and the speaker crackled. The chubby face and shoulders of\nCarson Newell took form and floated on the plate.\n\n\"Wanted to be sure you got the latest dope on Grogan before you see\nhim,\" Newell said. \"Just now got the report.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, then--\" The boss looked up from his note pad. \"About how long had\nthe telenosis been on you? How many days?\"\n\n\"H'm. Don't know. It's hard to tell, if it's handled right. Weird\nnightmares, daydreams, absent-mindedness, sudden impulses, optical\nillusions--it can be telenosis, and it can be just you. I'd say three or\nfour days, but--\"\n\n\"Wouldn't necessarily prove anything, anyway,\" Newell broke in. \"Here's\nthe report on Grogan. Been out of Corrective for a little more than a\nmonth now. Went directly to Memphis. Cleared up business affairs there,\nthen went to Palm Beach for vacation. Arrived late Tuesday\nafternoon--four days ago. Took a suite in Space Verge hotel with four\nquote secretaries unquote, and has refused to see anyone. No unusually\nlarge baggage. No unusual activities reported. So much for that.\"\n\nHe turned a page of the note pad and went on: \"Corrective Institute\nrecord: responded favorably to treatment. Occupational training in\nadministrative accounting. Special courses in business and political\nethics. Now get this--it's the one thing that gives your hunch any\ncredibility at all. Three months intermittent telenosis therapy for\nslight paranoiac tendencies. Response favorable. Dismissed from C.I.\nafter five years, three weeks and six days. Classification: Apparent\ncure, but possibility of relapse.\"\n\nWe were both quiet for a while, looking at each other.\n\nThen I said, \"Well, I'll see him tomorrow. Remember, it's nothing but a\nhunch--not even that.\"\n\n\"Be careful, dammit,\" Newell cautioned.\n\n... I woke up sometime in the early morning, before it was light, with a\nclicking noise in my ears. I lay there in bed, gazing into the darkness,\nwondering, yet knowing, what would happen if the defense mech should\nbreak down--if a tube should give out, or if some little coil should\nprove defective.\n\nThe clicking stopped after a while, but it was a long time before I got\nback to sleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had no trouble getting an interview with Grogan. I'd known I wouldn't.\nIt was a simple matter of calling his suite and telling the\nloose-mouthed, scar-cheeked \"secretary\" who answered that Earl Langston\nwould like to make an appointment with Isaac Grogan for, say, 10:30.\n\n\"Grogan ain't seein' nobody,\" the secretary growled.\n\n\"Ask him,\" I said.\n\nThe face vanished and reappeared on the screen a few moments later.\n\"Okay. Come up anytime you're ready.\"\n\n\"Fifteen minutes,\" I said, and replaced the mike.\n\nI turned up the volume of the defense mech as high as it would go, and\nleft it in my room when I left.\n\nThe same hideous secretary, with the loose jowels and the deep, livid\nscar on his right cheek, met me at the door of Grogan's suite.\n\n\"Th' boss'll see you in th' library,\" the bodyguard rumbled, and led me\nto the room. The door closed, but did not click behind me.\n\nIsaac Grogan was slouched on a sofa, hands in his pockets, looking at\nthe floor.\n\nI stood for a moment, looking at him.\n\nHe had changed only a little in five years. He was a big man with a\nbroad, pleasant face and thick black hair. A deep dimple divided his\nchin. The last time I'd seen him, he had been getting a little paunchy,\nand there had been wrinkles developing in his neck and bags under his\neyes. But that had been from strain and worry, and he looked a lot\nbetter now.\n\n\"You're looking well,\" I told him.\n\n\"What the hell do you want?\" Grogan said quietly. \"Why can't you leave\nme alone? I don't want any trouble.\"\n\n\"Neither do I.\"\n\nAnd suddenly I felt very awkward. What the hell _did_ I want? Just\nexactly what had I expected to accomplish with this visit? I didn't\nreally know.\n\nI cleared my throat. \"I've got one question, Grogan. Maybe two. Then\nI'll leave.\"\n\nHe looked at me.\n\n\"Do you still blame me for what happened in Memphis?\" I asked.\n\nGrogan shifted his position and gave a sort of half-laugh. \"Langston,\nI've never liked you, and I don't now. But I can't say that I blame you\nfor the Memphis mess--if I ever did. Now, what's your other question?\"\n\n\"Telenosis,\" I said.\n\nHe waited, looking straight at me. \"Well? What about it?\"\n\n\"According to your C.I. record,\" I said, \"you had three months of\nintermittent telenosis therapy.\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"That's right. Lots of people do. You still haven't asked\nyour question.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have,\" I replied. \"I'll leave now. Thanks for your time.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe gorilla-secretary was opening the front door for me, when Grogan\nspoke again. \"Langston.\"\n\nI turned around.\n\nGrogan was standing in the door of the library.\n\n\"Langston,\" he repeated. \"I don't know what your angle is. I don't know\nwhy you came here, or whether you got what you wanted. Furthermore, I\ndon't care much. Five years ago is not today, Langston. I've changed.\nJust the same, I don't believe I want to see you again. I don't like\nyou. Okay?\"\n\nI said, \"Okay,\" and left.\n\nBack in my hotel room, I first turned down the volume of the defense\nmech, then sat down at the visiphone and put in a call to New York. The\npudgy image of Carson Newell appeared.\n\n\"I'm stumped,\" I told him.\n\n\"What's the matter? Did you see Grogan?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Just now.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Nothing. I'm stumped. He's completely changed. If there was ever a case\nof full and complete correction, I'd say Grogan is it.\"\n\nNewell tapped his fingertips together, then shrugged impatiently. \"Well,\nhell, I don't think we're getting anywhere on this. I'll turn it over to\nthe C.I.D. and let them worry about it.\"\n\n\"So what happens now?\" I asked. \"What am I supposed to do?\"\n\n\"Take a vacation. But hang on to that defense mech. Stay in Palm Beach\nand contact me pronto if anything happens. Buzz me at least once a day,\neven if anything doesn't happen.\"\n\nHe started to put down the mike, then lifted it again. \"How's the SRI?\"\n\n\"Oh, that. I'll whip out a story on it in a couple of days.\"\n\n\"No hurry. Find out all you can about it. Give you something to do while\nyou're waiting around.\"\n\nHe put down the mike and faded from the screen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo I promptly did my damnedest to forget all about Isaac Grogan and\ntelenosis. I spent the rest of the day at the beach, sprawled out on the\nhot sand with the defense mech beside me and an army of people--humans\nand aliens--surrounding me. Only once, at about four o'clock, did the\ndefense mech start going _click-click-click_. I timed it. It lasted\nthree minutes and then quit.\n\nWhen I got back to the hotel, at about five, a man fell into step with\nme as soon as I entered the lobby.\n\n\"Name's Maxwell,\" he told me. \"C.I.D. I'm one of your bodyguards for a\nwhile.\"\n\n\"How many others do I rate?\" I asked.\n\nHe was a tall, heavily built young man in his middle twenties. He\ncarried a briefcase. We headed for the elevator.\n\n\"Only one,\" he replied, \"but he'll stay pretty much out of sight. He'll\njoin us in your room after a while. We have to ask you a lot of\nquestions.\"\n\nThe other bodyguard, who slipped into my room without knocking twenty\nminutes later, was shorter, thinner and older. He was bald except for a\ngray fringe, and his name was Johnson.\n\nThe C.I.D. men spent a half-hour checking for hidden mikes and cameras\nbefore they said much of anything. Then they plopped down on the edge of\nthe bed, and the young man opened his briefcase.\n\nThe older one said, \"Have your dinner sent up here. We'll get started on\nsome of these questions right away.\"\n\nThe questions were both exhaustive and exhausting. The older man,\nJohnson, fired the questions, and Maxwell wrote down the answers,\noccasionally inserting an inquiry of his own. They wanted to know\neverything--not only about my telenosis experiences and my knowledge of\nand contacts with Isaac Grogan, but everything I had done, said or\nthought during the past two weeks, everyone I had met and talked to, and\neverything we had talked about.\n\nAt the end of three and a half hours, I felt completely pumped out, and\nMaxwell had a sheaf of notes the size of a best-seller.\n\nJohnson said, \"Well, I guess that'll do for a starter. We'll have\nanother session tomorrow.\"\n\nHe took the notes from Maxwell and put them in Maxwell's briefcase. He\nstood up. \"I'll have these transcribed and maybe check around a little.\nI'll meet you here at six-thirty tomorrow night.\"\n\n\"What about--\" I started. He cut me off: \"Maxwell will stay with you.\nHe's not to let you out of his sight. In case anyone asks, he's your\nbrother-in-law from Sacramento.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI couldn't help laughing--but it was an admiring laugh. \"You fellows are\nnothing if not thorough. Does my real brother-in-law, John Maxwell of\nSacramento, know about this?\" I was curious.\n\nIt was Maxwell who answered. \"Your brother-in-law received a\nlong-distance emergency call from you at noon today, telling him to join\nyou immediately. Vision-reception was fuzzy, but he recognized your\nvoice and took the first strato. I changed places with him in Denver,\nwhere I happened to be stationed, and he was smuggled back home. He's\nwith his family, but he'll have to stay in for a few days.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"It's marvelous. Thoroughness personified. Say, I'll\nbet you fellows even thought of getting defense mechanisms ... but where\nare they?\"\n\nJohnson and Maxwell looked at each other, jaws hanging.\n\n\"Well, I'll be damned!\" Johnson said bitterly. \"Thoroughness\npersonified! Son of a....\" He slapped his hat on his bald head and\ndashed out the door without looking back.\n\nMaxwell grimaced. He got up from the bed and walked to an easy chair and\nsat down again. \"Well, Irvin Johnson will take care of _that_ little\ndetail. But it's going to take time....\"\n\n\"It would have taken time anyway--a day or so--even if you'd thought of\nit first thing,\" I said. \"Besides, there's no danger until they find\nyour wave-band, and that takes time, too.\"\n\nBut he remained disconsolate. Not because of the danger, but simply\nbecause they'd overlooked an angle. Under a system in which the agents\nare given maximum responsibility for details and planning, that would\ncount heavily against them on their records. I almost felt guilty for\nreminding them.\n\nI said, \"John, look--if all else fails, there's one sure quick defense.\nAlcohol. I would say that under the circumstances, since you're supposed\nto be protecting _me_, we should keep _you_ as well defended as\npossible.\"\n\n\"M'm?\"\n\n\"You do drink, don't you?\" I asked.\n\n\"Like a fish,\" Maxwell said, lunging to his feet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen we were back in the room, Maxwell said: \"Hell, I don't see that\ntelenoshis is such a damn menash to society, if all you have to do is\nget drunk.\"\n\n\"You want a nation of alcoholics?\" I said. I sat down on the bed and\nuntied my shoes. \"Anyway, whasha difference? D. T. horrors or 'noshis\nhorrors? Whash worse?\"\n\nMaxwell grunted.\n\nWe both had to sleep in the same bed, and Maxwell was a restless\nsleeper. I had finally crept into the lower depths of slumber, where it\nwas warm and snug, when he poked me sharply in the ribs.\n\n\"What's that?\" he demanded. He was sitting up.\n\n\"What's what?\"\n\n\"Listen!\"\n\nI heard it. _Click-click-click...._\n\n\"What time is it?\" I asked. My eyes were still closed, and I was damned\nif I was going to open them.\n\n\"Three fifty-seven. But what is--\"\n\n\"Defense mech,\" I said. \"Right on time. Every twelve hours. Tries to get\nme. Now go sleep.\"\n\nI rolled over and shut my eyes even tighter--but I couldn't get all the\nway back to sleep. Not back down to the warm, dark depths. It was a long\ntime before Maxwell even lay back down, and he rolled and twisted for\nthe rest of the night. At six o'clock, he fell into a deep, quiet\nslumber, and I was wide awake, damn him. So I got up and dressed.\n\nI found a news magazine I hadn't read, and occupied myself with it for\nan hour. Practically the entire issue was devoted to an analysis of the\nMartian immigration.\n\nIt went way back into history and discussed the folklore fear that\nhumans had for centuries about a Martian invasion. And it pointed out\nthat something very like a Martian invasion was taking place right now.\nOne particular article concluded with what I considered an unnecessarily\ngrim warning that unless something were done soon to check the flow of\nimmigrants, Earth would soon be overrun with Martians.\n\nOther articles in the magazine went into the causes and implications of\nthe migration. One of the writers pointed out that Mars is a dying\nplanet. In only a few thousand years, it will be too cold, too dry and\ntoo airless to support life.\n\nThe development of interplanetary travel a century earlier had provided\nthe inhabitants with a means of escape. They could survive on Earth; now\nthey could get to Earth; so they came to Earth.\n\nOne full article was devoted to the debates and pending legislation in\nWorld Council on the subject, but I didn't take the time to read it. I\nwas fairly familiar with the current controversy, having followed the\ndaily news reports, and besides, the reading was giving me a headache.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt seven o'clock, I considered going down for breakfast, but it occurred\nto me that it would be another black mark against Maxwell if I should be\nseen without him. Forgetting about the defense mech was enough for one\ncase.\n\nSo I ordered breakfast brought up to the room. While I was waiting, and\nsince I was sitting near it anyway, I flicked the TV switch and tuned in\non the morning's news. Nothing earthshaking: a factory explosion in St.\nLouis; political unrest in India; death of a Vegan millionaire; speech\nin The World Council by Delegate Machavowski of Eurasia in support of\nthe Bagley-Dalton bill to establish a yearly immigration quota of ten\nthousand from all planets, one thousand from Mars; protest reply by a\nMartian sociologist at Yale; spacecruiser crashed on Calypso, twenty\nkilled. And so on and so on.\n\nMy attention was held momentarily by the Martian question, since I was\nfreshly informed on it.\n\nWhile the two views of the issue did nothing to settle it in my mind,\nthey did serve to remind me of my Martian friend, Zan Matl Blekeke, and\nthe fact that I was supposed to be digging up a feature story on\nSuns-Rays Incorporated.\n\n\"What's on the agenda for today?\" my pseudo-brother-in-law asked as I\nwas finishing my coffee a half-hour later. He rolled out of bed, yawned\nand scratched his head vigorously. His hair was rumpled, but he looked\nrested, and I envied him to beat hell.\n\n\"You mean it's up to me?\" I asked.\n\n\"Sure. You just go on with your normal everyday existence and ignore me,\nlike I'm nothing but a shadow.\" He was still stretching lazily.\n\n\"Well, for the first thing, I'm going to see that we get a cot in here.\nThere isn't room in that bed for both of us.\"\n\nMaxwell grinned as he buttoned his shirt. \"D'I kick you out of bed?\nSorry. Should have warned you.\"\n\n\"Do you eat breakfast?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Hell, yes. Like a wolf.\"\n\n\"Well, let's go down and get you some breakfast while I figure out my\nagenda for today.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI wasn't sure what I wanted to do--start working on that SRI feature, I\nsupposed, so I could get it out of the way and either relax or\nconcentrate on this telenosis business, which I was supposed to be\nforgetting about. I had most of the dope I needed for the\nstory--atmosphere, first hand experience....\n\nEverything, it occurred to me, but the essential facts.\n\nFor instance, I would need to know more about Zan Blekeke\nhimself--simple biographical data that shouldn't take too long to\ngather. A harder job would be finding out about \"Dear Late Doctor.\" So\nfar I didn't even know what his name was. And if none of the SRI members\nwould talk about him....\n\nAs Maxwell and I sat at a breakfast room table, I made a mental\nchecklist of the points I would have to work on. I was staring out the\nwindow at the flowers staging a color-riot in the garden, when suddenly\nMaxwell said:\n\n\"Say, Earl, about how long does it take to find out a guy's brain wave\nband?\"\n\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\" I looked at him. He was shoveling pancakes into\nhis mouth like a fireman stoking a furnace.\n\nHe shrugged and swallowed. \"You said there was no danger from telenosis\nuntil they found my wave band. Well, last night I had the damnedest\nnightmares, and I was just wondering--\"\n\n\"Relax,\" I said. \"Ever been telenized?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"Got nothin' to worry about, then. If you had been telenized, it's just\npossible they could have gotten your band number from the Telenosis\nBureau. Which, by God, come to think of it, is where they probably got\nmine. But without that, or an electroencaphalograph, it'd take weeks, at\nleast.\"\n\n\"But can't it influence a lot of people at once? I mean, like mass\nhypnosis?\"\n\n\"Sure be hell if it could,\" I said. \"But I don't think it can. I don't\nknow why not, but I definitely remember old Doc Reighardt saying it'd\nnever been done.\"\n\nHe seemed to feel better. He finished his breakfast in relative silence.\nI was able to map out a general procedure for gathering all of the\nnecessary SRI information.\n\nFirst step was to get hold of Zan Blekeke again and have him tell me his\nlife history. I shuddered at the prospect, but it had to be done.\n\n\"We're going to East Emerson beach,\" I told John Maxwell.\n\nOn the way, aboard a third-level bus, I asked him, \"SRI ever been\ninvestigated by you people?\"\n\n\"Damn if I know. Why?\"\n\n\"Never mind. Save me a lot of trouble, maybe, if it had. Just a\nthought.\"\n\nWe found the SRI cultists at their usual place on the beach. It was a\nstretch on the far south end, a rough, gravelly portion quite a bit\nbeyond the army of regular bathers.\n\nAs we approached, threading our way through the maze of umbrellas,\ntablecloths and people, people, people in practically all stages of\nnudity, I noticed that a makeshift rope fence enclosed the little group\nof SRIs where they were sprawled out doing their relaxing exercises.\nThat was something new--the fence, I mean.\n\nI started to crawl through the ropes, and one of the nearby recliners\njumped to his feet, stood in front of me and made pushing motions with\nhis hands.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sirs, but this is a meeting of The Suns-Rays Incorporated\nreligious group. You are requested not to enter.\"\n\nNow, he knew better than to say a silly thing like that to me. His name\nwas Monte Bingham, and he knew damn well who I was, and I told him so.\n\"I'm practically an ex-officio member in good standing myself,\" I said.\n\"Wake up, you goof.\"\n\nMonte Bingham turned slowly around and looked toward the big Martian,\nZan Blekeke, who was sitting up with his spindly legs outstretched near\nthe center of the enclosure.\n\nBlekeke got to his feet and waddled toward us, waving Bingham aside. He\nwas not smiling. He stood glaring at us.\n\n\"Whose?\" he said with a swift, half-gesture toward Maxwell.\n\n\"Whose?\" I repeated. \"He's mine. I mean, he's my brother-in-law, John\nMaxwell, come to visit me from Sacramento. He's okay. What's going on? I\njust wanted to make an appointment to talk with you.\"\n\nBlekeke heaved his big round bare chest. \"Trying still disciple in,\" he\nreplied.\n\n\"How's that? Discipline, you mean?\"\n\n\"Yups. Laters out. Strangers out. No excepting. Can't.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but you know me, and John here--\"\n\n\"Brother law oaks, but both laters. See hall hour halfish. Talk then.\nTreatment, yups?\"\n\nI said, \"Well, I guess that'll be okay. Hour and a half, at the hall,\nhuh?\"\n\nBlekeke said, \"Yups,\" and turned away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe took two steps and stopped. I saw his spine stiffen. His head turned\nslowly toward the water's edge where two dogs were running circles\naround each other, not far from the enclosure. As the dogs moved,\nBlekeke's head moved with them, back and forth and back again....\n\nSuddenly one of the dogs, the smaller one--a black and white spaniel\nwith flapping ears--turned and raced through the SRI compound, bounding\ngracelessly over the sprawled bodies of SRI members. The larger German\nshepherd gave two woofs and leaped playfully in pursuit. They passed\nwithin about ten feet of Blekeke.\n\nWhen the German shepherd barked, I heard a thin, drawn-out squeak, like\na mouse with his tail caught in a trap, come from Blekeke. He turned\naround with incredible speed and took a half-step in our direction. His\nface was distorted as though in pain, and for an instant I thought he\nhad stepped on a jagged piece of glass or something.\n\nBut then I recognized the expression on his face. It was not pain.\n\nIt was terror.\n\nI noticed now that he was trembling violently. He twirled again and\nstarted in the opposite direction, stopped and turned swiftly around\nonce more. He acted as though he were surrounded on all sides by\ninvisible Martian-eaters.\n\nThe dogs paused at the edge of the enclosure for a moment to stand on\ntheir hind legs and exchange playful blows; then they raced off together\ntoward the more densely populated beach area.\n\nBlekeke's face suddenly relaxed, and with a final shudder he controlled\nthe trembling.\n\nHe was muttering: \"Doggie, doggie, doggie\" when he lowered his eyes to\nus, and he gave a little start as if he hadn't known we were standing\nthere.\n\n\"Hall. Hour halfish,\" he said after a moment's pause. Then he turned and\nwalked rapidly back into the midst of the prostrate SRI members and lay\ndown.\n\nMaxwell and I exchanged glances and walked away. I felt, all of a\nsudden, rather sad and depressed. When we had gone a respectable\ndistance, I said, \"Poor devil! Fear of dogs. It must be awful.\"\n\n\"Fear of dogs? Cynophobia? You think that's what it was?\"\n\n\"Well, sure,\" I replied. \"Only thing it could be.\"\n\nMaxwell said, \"First case I've ever seen of it.\"\n\n\"Me, too.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was still not quite ten o'clock. We killed the next hour and a half\nbasking in the Sun and taking occasional dips in the water. We had to go\none at a time, because one of us had to stay and guard the defense\nmech.\n\nAt 11:30 we kept our appointment with Blekeke. He was alone in the SRI\nhall, a long, low, metal building located a half-mile down the beach\nfrom the general bathing area.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hall had once been a storage warehouse of some kind--I have no idea\nwhat kind. But that had been a long time ago; and it was now used\nexclusively for SRI meetings.\n\nThere was another building near it, the ramshackle, rambling mansion of\na long-dead millionaire, which had been appropriated by the SRI as\nhousing quarters for the members who did not care to stay in rooms or\nhotels in town. And most of them didn't.\n\nMaxwell was interested in the house, but I couldn't tell him anything\nabout it. I had never been in it, whereas I had been in the hall several\ntimes. Of course, there was nothing much to explain about the hall--it\nwas practically bare.\n\nThe Sun Ray stood like an altar at one end. About thirty-five folding\nchairs were lined up in rows facing the Ray. That was all.\n\nBlekeke was doing something to the lamp part of the Ray when we came\nin--tightening the bulb, apparently. It was a very simple contraption.\nNothing but a padded, white-sheeted reclining table suspended over the\nfull length of which was the lamp. The thing was operated by a bank of\ncontrols wired up a few feet away from the table.\n\n\"Infra-red heat lamp,\" Maxwell whispered.\n\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"But don't say so.\"\n\nBlekeke saw us and jumped down from the platform and greeted us with\nopen arms, apologizing for his rude behavior on the beach.\n\nI told him to forget about it; that I just wanted to ask him a few\nquestions so I could write up my story about SRI--give him a little free\npublicity.\n\nBlekeke beamed. Said he'd be glad to help all he could.\n\nBut before I had a chance to ask any questions, he was blabbering: \"Give\ntreatment. New, improve. Much healthier. Give try.\" And he was pushing\nus toward the machine.\n\nI was not the least bit interested in taking a treatment, and I tried to\ntell him so, as kindly as I could. But he was insistent.\n\nFinally we agreed to take the treatment, hoping he would get it out of\nhis system. I handed the defense mech to Maxwell and lay down. Couldn't\ntell a damn bit of difference. Ten minutes of warmth and dozy\nrelaxation, and that's it. You don't feel a bit different after it's\nover than you did before.\n\nUnless you're a good cultist, and convince yourself by auto-suggestion\nthat all your bodily ills have been miraculously--if temporarily--baked\nout.\n\nAfter Maxwell had been given the treatment, I tried again to get Blekeke\npinned down to answering some of my questions, but it was no good.\n\nHe was obliging, cooperative and friendly as hell, but his heart just\nwasn't in it. He had to tell us about the improvements in the Ray, and\nwhen I threw specific questions at him, he always managed to answer with\nsome reference to the Ray and start all over again--and it was all pure\ngibberish.\n\nI gave up. We parted with mutual benedictions, and John Maxwell and I\nwalked away, toward the one-track road leading to the old mansion.\n\n\"What do _you_ do in a situation like this?\" I asked him.\n\nHe shrugged. \"Try somebody else.\"\n\nWe walked up the front steps of the mansion, and I punched the doorbell.\n\nIt was no go there, either. The cultist who opened the door, whom I\nremembered as a shoe salesman from Boise, informed us firmly and none\ntoo politely that no one could enter without the explicit and written\npermission of President Matl Blekeke. He showed no sign of recognizing\nme. He slammed the door.\n\nI gave emphatic utterance to an unprintable word and said, \"Let's go\nback to town.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJohnson showed up in the room promptly at six-thirty, as he had\npromised, again slipping in without knocking. He threw his briefcase and\nhis hat on the bed and pulled up a chair to the cardtable where Maxwell\nand I were playing chess.\n\n\"How about the defense mechs?\" Maxwell asked.\n\n\"Hospital in New York is working on 'em,\" Johnson said. \"Promised they'd\nhave 'em ready tomorrow morning. I'm going up tonight, after I get\nthrough here, so I can pick 'em up right away.\"\n\n\"Quick work,\" I said.\n\n\"Any new developments on this end? I've been too busy today getting\nthings organized to keep an eye on you.\"\n\n\"Every twelve hours Langston's defense mech starts clicking,\" Maxwell\nsaid. \"Four o'clock this morning and four o'clock this afternoon.\"\n\n\"So he's not giving up on you, anyway,\" Johnson said. \"We know he's\nstill around. What else? Anything new come up?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"Spent the whole day on a wild goose chase--from my point of\nview. Trying to dig up information for my feature about Suns-Rays\nIncorporated.\"\n\nJohnson nodded. \"No luck, huh?\"\n\nI told him about the so-called interview with Blekeke that morning, and\nhow in the afternoon I had tried to contact those SRI members who I knew\nhad been living in town. That had been futile, too; all of them had\nmoved to the house on the beach. Then Maxwell and I had spent a couple\nof hours in the library, checking reference books for some mention of\nSRI or any of its members. With no results.\n\nJohnson recognized the frustration in my voice. \"Don't let it get you\ndown,\" he said.\n\nI asked him if the C.I.D. had ever investigated the cult.\n\n\"Not yet,\" he said. \"Not that I know of. But everyone that you've had\nany contact with since you've been here is being checked thoroughly. And\nsince that includes the SRI cult, it'll get a very complete going-over.\"\n\nI said, \"Well, shucks, then. All I have to do is sit back and let you\nfellows dig up the information I need.\"\n\n\"That, of course, depends on how the information is classified after\nit's processed,\" Johnson corrected. \"Maybe you can use it and maybe you\ncan't.\" He shrugged. \"Well, I've got a whole new batch of questions here\nfor you. That's my job right now. Let's get at 'em.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter Johnson was gone and I again felt mentally empty, I turned to\nMaxwell, who was pacing the floor restlessly: \"Well, shall we go down\nand set up your defense barrier again?\"\n\n\"Let's take a walk,\" he said. \"I've got a headache. Fresh air might\nhelp.\"\n\n\"Suits me,\" I replied. \"I know of a little bar seven or eight blocks\nfrom here....\"\n\nI stopped because he was already going out the door, and I had to get up\nfrom the chair, grab the defense mech and run after him.\n\nHe wasn't hurrying, just walking casually, but not waiting for anything.\n\nIn the elevator, on the way down, he said, \"Those defense mechs. God\ndamn. I wish those defense mechs....\"\n\nI nudged him. The elevator operator was looking at him closely, and\nthere's no use taking any chances. He ought to know better.\n\nHe was out of the elevator as soon as the door opened at ground level.\nHe walked toward the front entrance. I had to run again to catch up\nwith him.\n\n\"Hey, what's the hurry?\" I asked. \"Can I come along too?\"\n\nHe didn't answer, just kept walking. Looking straight ahead, still not\nhurrying, but moving rapidly nevertheless. When we got outside, he\nturned right and continued at the same steady pace.\n\nI tugged at his arm. \"Hey, the bar I mentioned is the other way.\"\n\nHe shook my hand loose and kept walking. \"I want to go this way.\"\n\nI shrugged and trotted to keep up with him. \"Okay. If you know of a\nbetter place, we'll go there. But--\"\n\n\"This damn headache,\" he said. \"I've had it all day. All afternoon.\"\n\n\"My fault,\" I said. \"I started you puzzling over a problem that concerns\nonly me....\"\n\nHe wasn't listening.\n\nThere were few pedestrians on this level of traffic; most people who\nwalked places took the ambulators on the second level. Down here the\nsidewalks were narrow and the curbs high, the streets being used almost\nexclusively for heavy transfer and delivery trucks.\n\nA high metal railing along the street-side of the walk prevented\ncareless pedestrians from stepping in the path of the huge, swift,\nrumbling vehicles.\n\nBut there were no railings at the intersections.\n\nAnd at the next intersection, Maxwell stepped off the curb, shifted his\ncourse just a fraction, and went on at a tangent that would have had him\nsmack in the middle of a truck-traffic lane.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI grabbed his arm and pulled hard, to get him headed back in the right\ndirection.\n\n\"What the hell are you trying to do--get yourself killed?\"\n\nWhich was almost exactly what I'd started to say. But he was the one who\nsaid it.\n\nSo I just said, \"_Huh?_\"\n\nHe jerked his arm free and continued walking--straight toward an\noncoming 100-ton semi.\n\nI had a sudden idea of what was going on, and acted rapidly.\n\nI set the defense mech down, because you can't handle a man Maxwell's\nsize with only one hand. I grabbed his arm again, this time with both\nhands, and pulled as hard as I could. It jerked him off balance and out\nof danger. The semi roared past.\n\nAnd Maxwell turned on me with sudden, violent anger.\n\n\"Listen,\" he snapped, \"what in hell's the matter with you? What do you\nthink you're doing?\"\n\nI didn't argue with him. I took careful aim and threw a haymaker,\ngiving it everything I had. It caught the point of his chin squarely and\njarred me to my ankle.\n\nHe swayed a little bit and his face went blank, but he didn't fall.\n\nFor which I shall be eternally grateful.\n\nAnother giant semi, still nearly a block away, was hurtling toward us.\nIf Maxwell had fallen, I could not possibly have dragged him out of the\nway in time. And the semi couldn't have stopped in that distance.\n\nAs it was, I was able to snatch up the defense mech with one hand and\npropel Maxwell to the opposite curb, just seconds before the truck went\nby with a whiz and a rattle.\n\nI got Maxwell onto an escalator leading to the second level before his\nlegs buckled. Then he went to his knees. I managed to get his arm around\nmy shoulder and hoist him back to his feet before we reached the top.\n\nOn the second level there were no vehicles; quite a few pedestrians\nglided by in both directions, on several different speeds of ambulator\nbands.\n\nI spotted a bar down the street and dragged Maxwell onto a amband going\nthat way.\n\nBy the time I got him inside and settled in a booth, he was beginning to\nrecover, shaking his head and muttering to himself.\n\nI ordered a whole bottle of Scotch and handed Maxwell a glass of the\nstuff. He took it automatically and drank half of it as though it were\nwater.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe put the glass down quickly and half rose from his seat, clutching his\nthroat and gasping. I handed him another glass, this one containing\nwater. He drank it and sat back down, slowly.\n\n\"Drink the rest of that Scotch,\" I said. \"Drink it quick and don't ask\nany questions. Someone's got a telenosis beam on you, and he isn't\nkidding.\"\n\nIt penetrated, for he emptied the glass with short but rapid gulps. I\nfilled the glass again and ordered more water. It took him fifteen\nminutes to kill the glass this time, taking only a little sip of Scotch\nfor every deep gulp of water. But he got it down, though he was nearly\nunconscious at the end.\n\n\"Listen,\" I said, reaching over to shake his limp shoulder. \"Are you\nstill with me? For the love of heaven, don't pass out on me--that's\nabout the worst thing you could do. John!\"\n\nHe jerked his head and regarded me with unfocused eyes. \"Huh? Wash\nmatter, ole fren? I'm wish ya. Wish ya ta the end. Washer trouble, huh?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nI said, \"John, listen. You're in danger. We've got to get you out of\nhere. Out of town. Back to New York. Right away! Do you understand?\"\n\nHe nodded limply. I wasn't sure whether he really understood or not. But\nif he could only walk, it wouldn't make much difference.\n\nIf only he didn't pass out ... it wasn't very far. Just back to the\ndoor, then into the elevator instead of going onto the street at this\nlevel. Then, on the third level, only the few feet necessary to catch a\nbus or a cab to take us to the strato-port.\n\nIf he _couldn't_ walk, I didn't know what I'd do. Whoever the telenosis\noperator was, I was sure he had followed us to this bar through\nMaxwell's mind. That's the way telenosis works. Alcohol sets up a\ncomplete barrier, and contact is broken entirely; but about all a blow\non the head does is immobilize the victim--visions, commands and other\nimpressions can still penetrate, and the operator can still receive\nwhatever sensations his victim may have.\n\nMaxwell hadn't been unconscious enough for us to be safe. Someone wanted\nour blood. We had to move fast.\n\nAnd if he couldn't manage to walk at all....\n\nHe couldn't, exactly. But he could get to his feet and lurch and stumble\nalong after a fashion.\n\nIt accomplished the same purpose.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI got him to the third level, and we stood at the entrance of the bar\nwhile I got myself oriented.\n\nI had made a tactical error. Vehicles going to the strato-port stopped\non the other side of the street. And to get there, I would now have to\nwalk Maxwell all the way down to the end of the block to a pedestrian\ncross-walk, then halfway back up the other side.\n\nThe alternative was to go down again and cross in the middle of the\nblock on the pedestrian level, which is what I should have done in the\nfirst place.\n\nBut I wanted to get as far away from the bar as possible and as soon as\npossible. So I shrugged and turned to my left, shoving and dragging\nMaxwell with me.\n\nAs I did so, my defense mech started clicking.\n\nMaxwell stumbled and nearly fell. I shoved him against the side of a\nbuilding and leaned against him to keep him up. The liquor had hit him\nhard. If he once went down, there would be no getting him up. Not by me.\n\nWe did better after I wrapped one of his arms around my shoulder. I\ncould carry part of his weight and I had better control of him. I kept\nhim as close to the storefronts as possible, to minimize the possibility\nof being recognized from a moving vehicle in the street.\n\nIt didn't do a bit of good.\n\nThey'd probably spotted us as soon as we stepped away from the bar\nentrance. For all I know, they had been waiting for us since we entered\nthe bar.\n\nThree of them. Sitting there in the illegally parked light passenger\nsedan just ahead of us.\n\nI saw it when we were still fifteen feet away. I saw it, and I knew what\nit was, and I stopped.\n\nThe sedan wasn't really parked. It was just pulled over close against\nthe curb, moving slowly toward us.\n\nWhen I stopped, the sedan moved up quickly even with us, and two men\nstepped out.\n\nI edged Maxwell toward a drugstore entrance a few feet to the left, but\nthe men from the sedan were at our side in an instant.\n\n\"Hey, friend, got a match?\" one of them asked for the benefit of a\npassing couple who glanced at us.\n\nI recognized him. A deep criss-crossed scar ran from above his right\ncheekbone vertically down his cheek, ending in a big dent in his jaw\nbone. His lips were thick and loose.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor just an instant I was motionless, frozen, my right hand holding\nMaxwell's arm over my shoulder, my left hand gripping the quietly\nticking defense mech.\n\nThen I moved almost without thinking about it.\n\nI released my grip on Maxwell's arm, shoving him against the thug that I\ndidn't recognize. At the same time, I swung my defense mech, aiming at\nthe head of my scarfaced acquaintance. He raised his arm, but the heavy\ncase slammed into it and bounced off his forehead.\n\nIt probably broke his arm, and possibly fractured his skull. I didn't\nwait to find out.\n\nHolding tightly to the defense mech, I darted into the store entrance. I\nleft Maxwell blindly clutching the assailant into whose path I had\nthrown him. I didn't worry about Maxwell. They could have him. If I got\naway, they wouldn't dare kill him. And if I didn't get away, they would\nkill both of us.\n\nThe escalator was just inside the door to the right, and I ran down the\ndownward-moving steps, doubling back to the left at the bottom, and out\nthe door on the pedestrian level. I turned left again and ran to the\ncorner, crossed the street and ran three-fourths the length of the\nblock.\n\nI glanced backward and didn't see anyone running after me, so I entered\na late-hour department store. I wasn't safe yet, and I didn't feel safe,\nbut I felt encouraged enough to slow down to a fast walk through the\naisles of the men's clothing section.\n\nI had to get to a visiphone, first of all, and call Newell in New York.\nAnd then--well, I wasn't sure. Hide, somewhere. Keep from being\ncaptured.\n\nIt took me three minutes of rapid wandering through the building to find\na row of visiphone booths. I placed the call. While I waited, nervously\ncrossing and uncrossing my legs, peering intermittently out the window\nto see if there was any sign of pursuit, I had time to think.\n\nI had time to think, but I didn't think. Not really. I was thinking of\nwhat I was going to tell Newell. Thinking of Maxwell being dragged away\nby Grogan's \"secretaries,\" and wondering what would happen to him. But I\ndidn't really think, and maybe it's just as well.\n\nA little less than nine agonizing minutes elapsed before Newell's plump\nface appeared on the screen.\n\n\"You're late tonight,\" he said. \"I was just on the verge of calling you.\nHow're things going?\"\n\nI told him quickly, and with a minimum of detail, what had happened\nsince our last session.\n\n\"It's Grogan, after all,\" I said. \"I'd recognize that scarfaced gorilla\nof his anywhere. Get Grogan and--\"\n\nThe boss nodded. \"We'll get him. You let me worry about that. You've got\nto.... You say they were beaming telenosis on Maxwell? How the devil did\nthey get his wave-band so soon?\"\n\n\"You can worry about that one, too,\" I told him.\n\n\"Okay. Never mind. Where are you now? Never mind that either. Just stay\nthere. Call the nearest police station and have them send someone after\nyou. Get in a nice snug cell and stay put. We'll take care of Grogan and\nMaxwell. Okay, now. Don't waste any time.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe hung up together. Then I quickly dialed the operator and asked for\nthe nearest sectional police station.\n\nWhen the face of the desk sergeant flashed on the screen, I told him,\n\"My name is Earl Langston. My life is in immediate danger. I'm in a vp\nbooth near the Pacific Street entrance, number four, of Underhill's\ndepartment store, second level.\"\n\n\"Stay where you are,\" the sergeant replied. \"We'll have someone after\nyou in ten or fifteen minutes.\"\n\nIn a surprisingly short time, an overweight, gray-uniformed policeman\nwith a face like a bulldog rapped at the door of the booth.\n\nI stood up and opened the door.\n\n\"Earl Langston?\" he asked. I nodded and followed him to an elevator. We\nwent up to the third level and then through a maze of aisles and\ndepartments before going out a door that opened on a parking lot.\n\nThe policeman led me to an unmarked auto and opened the back door for\nme. Two dogs barked at my heels as we walked to the vehicle. I shooed\nthem off before I closed the door.\n\nI leaned back on the soft cushions with a sigh and set the heavy defense\nmech on the edge of the seat beside me, still holding the handle loosely\nwith one hand.\n\nThe motor purred as we moved slowly out of the parking lot and into the\nstreet.\n\nI paid no attention to where we were going. Just breathed another sigh\nand closed my eyes. At last, I could begin to relax. In just a few\nminutes, now, I'd be safe. I hadn't realized how tense I was. My neck\nmuscles ached and my stomach slipped slowly from my chest cavity back\ndown to where it belonged.\n\nIt seemed a long time ago that I had abandoned Maxwell to Grogan's\nthugs.... What had happened to him since then? How long ago had it been?\nOnly half an hour? Not much longer, anyway.\n\nNow again I had time to think, and this time I did think. I began to ask\nmyself questions--to wonder about certain things.\n\nHow had Grogan learned Maxwell's wave-band so soon?\n\nWhat was Grogan doing with a telenizer in the first place, and what was\nhe up to? Just personal revenge against me?\n\nHow did I know for sure that it _was_ Grogan?\n\nThat question startled me. I opened my eyes and sat up straight. In\nmoving so suddenly, my hand knocked over the defense mech and it thudded\nto the floor. As I bent quickly to pick it up, it started clicking\nagain.\n\nSeveral things occurred to me at once, then, and my stomach wadded\nitself into a tight ball and shot up again to press against my heart. My\nneck and back muscles tightened.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first thing that struck me, I think, was that the defense mech had\nstarted clicking _again_. It had been clicking before.... As Maxwell and\nI left the bar, the defense mech had begun clicking steadily.\nThen--sometime--it had stopped. Probably when I hit Scarface with it.\nBut I hadn't noticed. And for thirty minutes--closer to forty-five,\nnow....\n\nThere was no particular sequence to the flood of realizations that\nrushed my consciousness next and left me feeling weak and shaky.\n\nThe desk sergeant had said ten minutes. The policeman had gotten there\nin less than five. We were driving, not through side streets toward a\npolice station, but along a high-speed lane of a main thoroughfare, away\nfrom the city. Two dogs had yapped at my heels. The \"police\" vehicle was\nunmarked--unusual if not illegal.\n\nWhen I looked at the driver, he was not, of course, a policeman.\n\nHe was one of Grogan's bodyguards--the one into whose arms I had thrown\nMaxwell not long ago.\n\nHe was staring straight ahead at the road, his spread-nosed face\ncomposed. He hadn't noticed anything.\n\nI took a deep breath and leaned back again, half-closing my eyes. But I\ndid not relax. The clicking of the defense mech seemed thunderous to me,\nbut if the driver heard it, he gave no indication. Perhaps it would have\nmeant nothing to him if he did hear it.\n\nI tried to think of the problem at hand, but my mind refused to\ncooperate. It kept rushing back to events of the recent past and\ndemanding reasons and explanations.\n\nWhen the defense mech faltered and quietly stopped clicking, I was aware\nof it this time. My first impulse was to hit it with my hand and try to\nmake it work again, but I restrained myself.\n\nI controlled my thoughts firmly, holding them tight and shaping them\ncarefully in my mind before letting them go.\n\nThe driver was again a policeman in the gray police uniform. We were\nonce more driving slowly through city streets instead of speeding along\na highway. Two dogs ran beside the auto, barking--the same two dogs that\nI had shooed before I closed the door.\n\nI formed my thoughts: _I know who you are. It's no secret any more. But\nwhy? What are you trying to do?_\n\nThere was no reply.\n\nIt could mean one of two things. Either he simply didn't want to answer,\nor else he wasn't on the machine in person but was playing an\nimpression-tape on my wave-band. I tried again.\n\n_You're licked, you know. Already you're licked. Even if my call to\nNewell was nothing but a telenosis dream--even if no one knows anything\nabout this but me, you're still licked--_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo reply. None of any kind. I'd expected at least to get a sinister\nchuckle, or a flood of horrors. But there was nothing more nor less than\nwhat there had been--the policeman driving through quiet city streets,\nand the dogs barking.\n\nThen it was just a recording, prepared in advance. My mind was not being\nfollowed in person. Not right now.\n\nBut that was no help and no assurance. I still didn't dare get out of\nthe car. Or knock the driver over the head and take over the car myself.\nAt ninety miles an hour, and with a visual impression of moving slowly\nalong city streets, that would be a sure form of suicide.\n\nOr would it?\n\nApparently I had no choice but to wait until we arrived at our\ndestination and then do what I could--which might not be much.\n\nLord, if I could make another vp call before we got there!\n\nCareful, though. Even with no operator at the telenizer, I had to watch\nout for thought leakage. My thoughts were surely being recorded, and\ncertain kinds of thoughts might trigger automatic precautionary\nmeasures.\n\nI gave the defense mech a hard bang with my hand. It clicked twice. I\ngot a brief glimpse of the highway flashing past and the lights of other\nvehicles.\n\nThen the clicking stopped, and we were back in town, crawling along. I\nhit the defense mech again, a series of lighter blows, and it obediently\nclicked and this time continued clicking; and we were on the highway\nagain.\n\nMaking an effort to control my breathing and to muffle the sound of my\nrapidly pounding heart, I leaned forward and examined the controls of\nthe auto intently.\n\nThere was a phone. Not a visiphone, of course, but a phone nonetheless.\nA means of communication. There was also a luminous radar dial that\nmight or might not mean automatic controls.\n\nWhich might or might not be in operation.\n\nI concentrated on the hands and feet of the driver. Neither moved\nperceptibly. The course of the vehicle was straight and constant,\nthough, so that didn't prove anything.\n\n\"Hey, where in hell is this police station?\" I asked.\n\nWith a slight backward-turning motion of his head, the driver replied,\n\"Almost there. Just a few minutes now.\"\n\nAs his head moved, his hands moved the wheel a bare fraction. The auto\ndid not swerve.\n\nI took a deep breath and hit the driver on the side of the head with my\ndoubled right fist as hard as I could. He slumped, and I hit him again.\nHis hands slid from the wheel ... and the car continued on its course.\n\nI clambered into the front seat with the driver.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs I lifted the mike, the auto started slowing down, and I thought for a\nmoment it wasn't electronically controlled after all. That was a\nhorrible moment, and I clutched at the wheel instinctively, but the car\nstill did not swerve.\n\nSo I quit worrying about that and dialed the number.\n\nThe conversation, once I had the call through, took quite a little\nwhile. I had to convince the man that I was serious. While I was\ntalking, arguing frantically, the auto was slowing almost to a stop,\nmaneuvering over to the turning lane on the right, making the turn and\nfollowing a narrow road that crossed under the highway.\n\nThe urgency of my voice must have been pretty convincing, because the\nvoice on the other end finally said, \"Well, I'll do what I can, Mr.\nLangston, but it'll take time. Maybe an hour. Maybe more. And so help\nme, if this is a joke--\"\n\n\"It's no joke,\" I pleaded. \"Believe me, it isn't. Please make it as fast\nas you can. Civilization may be at stake.\" On that deliberately ominous\nnote, I hung up.\n\nImmediately I began thinking of the things I should have done, the\nmachinery I should have set in motion instead of the one thing I had\ndone. By all means, I ought to have notified the police directly. My\nnotion that telenosis influenced all the police desk sergeants in town\nwas hysterical, baseless. Well, I could call back, even now--\n\nBut I couldn't.\n\nThe car was moving at a relatively slow speed--but still over fifty\nmiles an hour, on a narrow unpaved, downgrade road. Through the side\nwindow I saw dark trees and shadowy brush gliding by.\n\nAnd then through the window I saw lighted storefronts, mail boxes, a few\nvague pedestrians on smooth sidewalks, and two dogs running tirelessly\nbeside the car, barking as they ran....\n\nRepeated pounding on the heavy black box did not restore reality.\n\nNow I did not dare use the phone again or even think about it. I was\nsitting beside the driver, and the driver was sitting erect at the\nwheel.\n\nOn a sudden, stupid impulse, I struck at the driver's head, and my hand\nwent through it without touching anything. I groped with my hand until I\nfelt the man's limp head where my eyes said his shoulder was.\n\nWith a suppressed shudder, I drew my hand away and sat back in the seat\nto wait. It couldn't be long now.\n\nThe car turned a corner and continued at a much slower pace. It went\nperhaps a hundred yards before it pulled to the curb and stopped. Across\nthe street I saw the police station. The entrance looked like any other\nstore or business entrance, but a marquee-sign above the entrance read:\n\"Section 4 Police Station.\"\n\nThe driver sat motionless behind the wheel. He would not move, I knew,\nuntil....\n\nI shrugged, picked up the defense mech, and opened the door.\n\nPedestrians walked by along the sidewalk, and autos glided in both\ndirections on the street. Dogs yapped at my heels. I ignored them. They\ndid not exist.\n\nBut I knew the police station did exist.\n\nI walked directly toward the entrance--a long kitty-corner across the\nstreet. When a powerfully humming auto headed toward me, I closed my\neyes and braced myself and continued walking.\n\nIt is not a pleasant sensation to be run down by a car--even a dream-car\nwith no substance.\n\nMy skin was prickly and my palms moist. I could feel the blood pounding\nin my head.\n\nThe door to the police station was open. A short flight of stairs went\nup to another door that was closed. I did not ring the bell, but opened\nthe door and stepped into the reception room.\n\nThe room was empty except for the uniformed policeman sitting at the\nradio bank on the other side of the railing with his back to me. He wore\nearphones.\n\nAs the door clicked shut, the policeman turned in his swivel chair to\nface me.\n\n\"Hello, Langston, we've been expecting you,\" he said.\n\nIt was Isaac Grogan.\n\nI smiled and replied with calmness that amazed me:\n\n\"Yes, I daresay you have, Zan Matl Blekeke.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMaxwell and I were alone in the small, bare, brightly lighted but\nwindowless room.\n\nBlekeke had spent a half-hour after my arrival trying to find out how\nmuch I knew. But after my initial shocker--letting him know that I\nrecognized him--I had kept my mind closed tightly; and I was keeping it\nclosed now. Blekeke was still listening in--I had no doubt of that.\nMaxwell knew it too, for he made no attempt at conversation.\n\nHe sat with his back to the walls in one corner, and I crouched in\nanother corner, and we sat there, staring at the walls and at each\nother, not daring to speak or to think.\n\nAfter about ten or fifteen minutes the door opened, and Blekeke stepped\nin. He was wearing earphones, and a wire trailed behind him. In one hand\nhe carried a blaster.\n\nHe smiled broadly and nodded, once at each of us. \"Something show you,\"\nhe said. \"Watching.\"\n\nHe pushed a button on the wall beside the door and the lights died. For\nan instant everything was black, and I braved myself. Then the wall\nbeside Blekeke glowed, flickered--and a scene in black and white came\ninto focus.\n\n\"This observer room,\" Blekeke said. \"Show what camera top meeting hall\nsee.\"\n\nThe scene was dim; a half-moon bobbed and splashed in ocean waves in the\nbackground. In the right foreground, close and large, dark and dull, was\nthe spaceship.\n\nIt was Martian, but not military. An old cargo carrier. Its rear jets\nwere extinguished, but the ship was vibrating.\n\n_Leaving?_ I wondered--and Blekeke caught my thought over the telenizer\nearphones.\n\n_No--just arriving_, was his answer in my mind. _But it leave again very\nsoon. You with. Soon no matter what you know. What did. Soon gone._\n\n_How soon?_ I demanded.\n\nBlekeke spoke aloud: \"Very soon. Fifteen, twenty, half-hour minutes.\nLooking more. All way right.\"\n\nI looked at the extreme right edge of the picture, where a rough,\nshadowy hillock arose. While I watched, an opening appeared in the\nhillock and a dim human figure emerged. It stood erect and walked across\nthe stretch of gravel beach toward the spaceship. Another figure came\nfrom the hillock aperture and followed the first.\n\nThe thought came from Blekeke: _Cultists. Evidence. Prove my success._\n\n_Success in what? Why? How?_\n\nBlekeke pushed the button on the wall again, and the lights were\nsuddenly on, and the wall bare.\n\n\"No harm tell you now,\" he said. \"Gone soon. No matter.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe leaned against the wall and crossed his fragile arms across his huge\nred chest. He said:\n\n\"Mars home dying. You know. Need more somewhere. Earth best, but some\nEarthmen deciding not want.\" He shrugged. \"Dear Late Doctor--\" he did\nnot bother making the mystic sign--\"was brilliant man. Dr. Homer\nReighardt--know name? Psychiatrist. Very old. No, I not kill; death\nnatural. I wanted live longer, but....\" he shrugged again. \"Learned much\nfrom, howso. He founded cult. I his servant after joining. He idea very\ninnocent--cure not really sick with mild 'nosis.\"\n\nHe smiled modestly. \"I also brilliant person. Learn tech part much\nrapid. Apply own idea, which not so innocent. Fact, very insidious.\nTelenize right persons, they _want_ Martian then! Vote to let come,\nyups?\"\n\nMaxwell broke in: \"Then why didn't you start in on the right people at\nonce? Why not set up your headquarters in Belgrade and telenize the\nWorld Council members, instead of playing around with a bunch of\nhypochondriacs here?\"\n\nBlekeke held up his hand. \"So fast not so. Must work with what got.\nDoctor machine very simple, and he telling me not all. Not trusting even\nme all way. Needing much work, then. Muchness development. Six months I\nworking, then need testing. SRI, oaks? So now have proof for Mars\ngovernment, which verysome cautious. Demanding evidence.\"\n\nThis time I broke in. \"Blekeke,\" I said, with some of the respect I was\nbeginning to feel for him, \"you're a patriot, I guess, and I have to\nadmire you for that. But you're also a damned fool. You can't get away\nwith this--and I think you know it. There are just too many loop-holes.\"\n\n\"Where loop-hole?\"\n\n\"Well, in the first place, I made a phone call before I got here--while\nI was in the car and my defense mech was on. As a result, the police\nwill be here in a very few minutes--probably before you can get to the\nrocket--\"\n\nBlekeke smiled blandly. \"Where second place?\"\n\n\"In the second place, assuming that you do get to the spaceship and take\noff before the police get here, it still won't matter. They _know_, now,\nwho has been operating the telenizer. They can track you down. You'll be\npicked up long before you get to Mars.\" I stood up and strode\npurposefully toward him. \"Give me the blaster, dammit. You're licked\nbefore you're even started.\"\n\nBlekeke frowned and pointed the blaster at my chest. \"Please. So fast\nnot so. Go back corner, please.\"\n\nI obediently returned to the corner and sat down. It had been worth a\ntry.\n\nThe Martian lowered the weapon and smiled. \"You too brave. I not like\nkill. But pfoof for loop-hole. All plugged. Looking what front-door\ncamera see. Polices here now.\"\n\nHe pushed the button on the wall.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA police auto was screeching to a halt in the driveway before the big\nhouse, and a half-dozen uniformed men, armed with deadly blasters, were\npiling out. Another car was whipping around the final curve.\n\nI knew that Maxwell was giving me a look of gratitude, but suddenly I\nwasn't sure it was warranted. I had assumed on a sort of blind faith\nthat the police would get here in time--but as I watched the scene, I\ndidn't feel so good.\n\nFor the policemen were not charging the house. They were not even\nlooking at it.\n\nThey were milling around, aimlessly. No, not aimlessly, exactly. They\nwere looking _for_ something; but they weren't seeing it. One of them\ngot back in the car and used the radio, and the others wandered around,\nglancing unseeingly in all directions.\n\n\"Mass telenosis?\" I asked quietly, not taking my eyes from the scene,\nfeeling my heart pound harder as I caught a glimpse of the bobbing,\nslower lights of another vehicle on the road far back.\n\nBlekeke said, \"Yups. Plug all loop-hole. Police not see house, not see\nship. No one see ship leave, not knowing Blekeke on board. Complete\nvanish.\" He shrugged. \"Ship keep commercial schedule. Take auxiliary\npower to right course, then switch rocket. Stopped on way, maybe, so\nwhat? Telenize searchers, yups?\"\n\n\"What about the house?\" I asked.\n\n\"Go boom when we leave,\" Blekeke said.\n\nMaxwell said, \"Judas! Everyone will just assume that we and Blekeke and\nall the cultists have gone boom, too. That's likely to end the\ninvestigation right there. Slow it down plenty, at least.\"\n\nBlekeke nodded applaudingly. \"Yups. Is so.\"\n\nHe pushed the wall-button and we had the spaceship scene again. Men and\nMartians were loading large crates into the port of the ship. The other\nbulky boxes were being moved across the beach from the opening in the\nhill.\n\n\"Leaving soon now,\" Blekeke said as he switched the lights on. \"That\nmost of vital equipment. Other going boom. We work awful quickness,\nyups?\"\n\n\"Just how do you mean?\" I asked, more to kill time than out of real\ncuriosity.\n\n\"Ha! You not knowing how quickness we work since morning--since getting\nMaxwell brain band on measure machine Sun Ray....\"\n\nMaxwell exclaimed; \"Oh, hell, of course! Son of a blunder! _That's_ how\nyou got it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had already figured that out, and I guessed it was the information\nBlekeke had gained from Maxwell's mind that was forcing him to act now,\nbefore he had planned.\n\n\"When learned you planning 'vestigate SRI, had move fast,\" Blekeke\ncorroborated. \"So did. Not know you law man till then. Only that\nLangston mind stopped 'nosis. Not even knowing why. Worried for\nwhile--whew!\" He wiped the mock perspiration from his brow and smiled.\n\nI said, \"The thugs who attacked Maxwell and me were Grogan's men. May I\nask now--just out of curiosity--were they telenized, or was Grogan?\"\n\nBlekeke seemed happy to reply. \"Grogan. Reighardt happened work on\nGrogan in CI. Also your brain wave number in file, but I getting first\non Sun Ray machine.\"\n\nI had wondered about that, and there was another question that was\nbothering me.\n\n\"When you started that blood dripping in the bathtub,\" I said, \"was that\na deliberate attempt to scare me away, or was that part of the standard\ntreatment?\"\n\n\"Standard,\" Blekeke replied. \"Subject no longer trust own senses after.\nBut recognize 'nosis, so trying frighten you. Work good on others.\"\n\nI started to ask another question, but he switched on the spaceship\nloading scene again.\n\nA crane was hauling the last huge crate into the hold. All the\nhumans--the SRI cultists--were apparently aboard ship. None were\nvisible. A few Martians stood near the ship, some of them looking toward\nthe hillock opening, and some watching the loading.\n\nSuddenly two policemen came into view on the screen, walking casually\nover the hill in which the opening was located. At the top they halted\nand looked out over the ocean.\n\nOne of the men looked over his shoulder and pulled a bottle from an\ninside pocket. He offered it to his companion, who shook his head. The\nman shrugged and took a deep swallow himself, tucking the bottle inside\nhis jacket again.\n\nI caught a sudden note of mild alarm from Blekeke's mind, which reminded\nme that he was still listening for careless thoughts of mine.\n\nThe policemen continued walking toward the beach, heading to the right\nof the spaceship. I saw one of the Martians step back into the shadow\nof the ship. The others followed the policemen with their eyes.\n\n\"We best going now,\" Blekeke said. He reached to turn off the\npicture....\n\nAnd his hand froze. He saw the same thing I saw, and at just about the\nsame time.\n\nHe saw a dog.\n\nAnd he must have felt the triumphant, incoherent chortle that gushed\nfrom my mind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dog was a small, ragged, spotted terrier. It came trotting\nabsentmindedly over the hill after the policemen, and at the top it\nstopped. It quivered. It sat down, pointed its nose at the spaceship and\nopened its mouth in a howl I could almost hear.\n\nThen the scene was gone; the lights in the room glowed; Blekeke was\npointing the blaster at me.\n\nAnd his trigger finger was trembling.\n\nHe was shaking, very slightly, all over. His red-hued skin had turned a\nmuch paler shade.\n\nI don't think I moved a muscle while I waited for him to speak.\n\n\"I should killing you,\" he said. \"Right now, I should killing you. Then\nmaybe killing me. Or make boom.\" He laughed shrilly, almost\nhysterically. \"You very cleverish. Finding one weakener. Tell polices\nbringing dogs.\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" I said. \"As a matter of fact, I told the dogs to bring the\npolice.\"\n\nThat caught his interest. His hand on the blaster relaxed enough so that\nI could breath.\n\n\"That call I made from the car, coming here,\" I said. \"It wasn't to the\npolice. After the results of my first call to them, I thought it was\njust possible that you had somehow telenized all the desk sergeants. I\nwasn't thinking too sharp just then. Anyway, I called the city dog\npound, instead. I told 'em to get as many dogs out here as fast as they\npossibly could.\"\n\nBlekeke spoke in a very soft voice. \"Cleverly, cleverly. And I giving\nself way.\"\n\n\"You sure did,\" I agreed. \"There's dogs in every damn vision you dream\nup, you hate 'em so much. Same way some people have snakes.\"\n\nBlekeke gestured with the blaster. He had regained some of his color,\nand he wasn't trembling. \"Getting up now. We leaving. Not kill if not\nnecessary.\"\n\nMaxwell and I stood up. Blekeke backed through the door, motioning for\nus to follow. He walked us ahead of him along a corridor and down two\nflights of stairs, staying a safe distance behind us.\n\nThe entrance to the tunnel was in the basement, through a door that\nlooked like any other door.\n\nBlekeke took off the earphones he was wearing and tossed them aside.\n\n\"This 'nizer blow up with house,\" he said.\n\nThe tunnel was wide, straight and brightly lighted. The opposite end was\na small black dot, but it didn't take us long to get there.\n\nMy thoughts were running wild, now that no one was listening.\n\nThe dogs had bothered Blekeke, but how badly? He seemed so damned sure\nof himself now. No hesitation at all. Or--was it merely resignation? I\ndidn't know. But if he once got us aboard that spaceship, his plan had a\nridiculously good chance of succeeding.\n\n... And would that be so bad? Were his motives so ignoble, or his\nmethods so very atrocious?\n\nI drove that line of thought from my mind. I could think about that\nlater....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom the outside entrance of the tunnel, the dark spaceship seemed\ndisturbingly close, and the expanse between it and us free of\nimpediments of any kind. Only fifty or sixty quick steps, and then....\nThe Martians at the ship saw us and climbed aboard. The ship was\nbeginning to vibrate again.\n\nThe two policemen were wandering around by the water's edge. We could\nhear the dogs howling. Several others had joined in now, but we couldn't\nsee them. They were above us.\n\n\"Walk slow to ship,\" Blekeke instructed, tenseness obvious in his voice.\n\"Casual. Like nothing. I right behind.\"\n\nMaxwell and I glanced at each other and stepped from the aperture to the\ngravelly beach and started walking very slowly and casually toward the\nspaceship.\n\nWe had gone about ten feet when we heard, in the short intervals when\nthe dogs weren't howling, the crunching footsteps of Blekeke behind us.\nThey were faltering.\n\nI couldn't resist a backward glance.\n\nI saw about a half-dozen dogs on the hill behind and above Blekeke. They\nwere squatting on their haunches, noses pointed at the spaceship, and\nthey were creating the damnedest racket I had ever heard. Surely the\ncops would at least _suspect_ something!\n\nBlekeke was walking stiffly, slowly, keeping the blaster pointed at us,\nmaking a visible effort not to turn around.\n\n\"Hey, you goddam dogs!\" one of the policemen on the beach shouted.\n\"Shut the hell up!\" He picked up a rock and threw it, but he was too far\naway. The missile whizzed low over my head. I ducked instinctively,\nturning to see where the stone hit. It missed the dogs by a good fifteen\nor twenty feet.\n\nOther policemen were appearing from the direction of the road, running\nanxiously toward the dogs, looking in the direction the dogs were\npointing.\n\nAnd seeing nothing.\n\nOther dogs were appearing, too, some well within the vision of\nBlekeke--but another quick glance showed me that he was staring rigidly\nahead and walking steadily.\n\nWe were entering the shadow of the spaceship. Less than twenty feet to\ngo. Even in the dim light, I could almost distinguish the features of\nthe Martian waiting there to haul us aboard.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe policemen on the beach were now walking back to join the others. The\none who had yelled and thrown the stone now whistled shrilly, and\nshouted, \"Commere, you lousy, flea-bitten mutts, and shut up!\"\n\nHe whistled again. Insistently.\n\nOne dog stopped howling and slunk forward timidly, then halted.\n\nThe whistle was a shrill command.\n\nI heard a soft gasp, perhaps a sob, from Blekeke.\n\nThe dog trotted slowly, reluctantly, forward, tail between its legs,\ngrowling and whining at the same time.\n\n\"Running! Running! Hurry!\" Blekeke screamed.\n\nInstead, I turned around to watch, and so did Maxwell.\n\nThe policeman continued to whistle. Another dog, a large, shaggy collie,\nleft the pack. But it was not timid, and it paid no attention to the\npolicemen--it had seen Blekeke, and it rushed at him, snarling and\nyapping.\n\nThe Martian made a gurgling noise. A shudder shook his frame, and he\nturned and fired.\n\nI was watching, without really comprehending what I saw, the policeman\nwho had been whistling. Abruptly he stopped whistling. He was _looking_.\nBut not at the dogs, nor at the other policemen. Not even at the shaggy\ncollie that vanished suddenly in a blinding flash.\n\nHe was looking at the spaceship. And seeing it. He rubbed a hand across\nhis eyes.\n\nWhen the collie was hit, the terrier which had slunk forward turned. At\nfive feet from Blekeke, it growled and leaped at him.\n\nBlekeke collapsed. The blaster dropped from his hand, and he crumpled\ninto a trembling, twitching, sobbing lump on the ground.\n\nI rushed to grab the blaster, and Maxwell kicked the snarling,\nfrightened dog away.\n\nAt the same time, the policeman yelled, \"Jupiter! It _is_ a spaceship! I\nknew I seen somethin'. I may have had a drink, but I ain't crazy!\"\n\nHe fired while he was yelling, and the Martian who had been leaning from\nthe port ducked inside. The ship shuddered and rose quickly, with a\nrumble that was almost drowned by the racket the dogs were making.\n\nThe policeman rubbed his eyes. \"Huh?... I coulda swore I saw a\nspaceship. Right _there_. Just _now_. Just a second ago.\"\n\n\"Man, you really _are_ drunk,\" his companion said.\n\nThe house blew up an instant later. No policemen were killed or injured\nin the explosion. They were all gathered on the beach to see why the\ndogs were howling.\n\nIt took a bit of explaining.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Telenizer, by Don Thompson\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TELENIZER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32574-8.txt or 32574-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/5/7/32574/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
