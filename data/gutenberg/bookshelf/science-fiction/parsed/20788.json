DISASTER\n\n\nThe Throg task force struck the Terran Survey camp a few minutes after\ndawn, without warning, and with a deadly precision which argued that the\naliens had fully reconnoitered and prepared that attack. Eye-searing\nlances of energy lashed back and forth across the base with methodical\naccuracy. And a single cowering witness, flattened on a ledge in the\nheights above, knew that when the last of those yellow-red bolts fell,\nnothing human would be left alive down there. His teeth closed hard upon\nthe thick stuff of the sleeve covering his thin forearm, and in his\nthroat a scream of terror and rage was stillborn.\n\nMore than caution kept him pinned on that narrow shelf of rock. Watching\nthat holocaust below, Shann Lantee could not force himself to move. The\nsheer ruthlessness of the Throg move-in left him momentarily weak. To\nlisten to a tale of Throgs in action, and to be an eye-witness to such\naction, were two vastly different things. He shivered in spite of the\nwarmth of the Survey Corps uniform.\n\nAs yet he had sighted none of the aliens, only their plate-shaped\nflyers. They would stay aloft until their long-range weapon cleared out\nall opposition. But how had they been able to make such a complete\nannihilation of the Terran force? The last report had placed the nearest\nThrog nest at least two systems away from Warlock. And a patrol lane had\nbeen drawn about the Circe system the minute that Survey had marked its\nsecond planet ready for colonization. Somehow the beetles had slipped\nthrough that supposedly tight cordon and would now consolidate their\ngains with their usual speed at rooting. First an energy attack to\nfinish the small Terran force; then they would simply take over.\n\nA month later, or maybe two months, and they could not have done it. The\ngrids would have been up, and any Throg ship venturing into Warlock's\namber-tinted sky would abruptly cease to be. In the race for survival as\na galactic power, Terra had that one small edge over the swarms of the\nenemy. They need only stake out their new-found world and get the grids\nassembled on its surface; then that planet would be locked to the\nbeetles. The critical period was between the first discovery of a\nsuitable colony world and the erection of grid control. Planets in the\npast had been lost during that time lag, just as Warlock was lost now.\n\nThrogs and Terrans ... For more than a century now, planet time, they\nhad been fighting their queer, twisted war among the stars. Terrans\nhunted worlds for colonization, the old hunger for land of their own\ndriving men from the over-populated worlds, out of Sol's system to the\nfar stars. And those worlds barren of intelligent native life, open to\nsettlers, were none too many and widely scattered. Perhaps half a dozen\nwere found in a quarter century, and of that six maybe only one was\nsuitable for human life without any costly and lengthy adaption of man\nor world. Warlock was one of the lucky finds which came so seldom.\n\nThrogs were predators, living on the loot they garnered. As yet, mankind\nhad not been able to discover whether they did indeed swarm from any\nhome world. Perhaps they lived eternally on board their plate ships with\nno permanent base, forced into a wandering life by the destruction of\nthe planet on which they had originally been spawned. But they were\nraiders now, laying waste defenseless worlds, picking up the wealth of\nshattered cities in which no native life remained. And their hidden\ntemporary bases were looped about the galaxy, their need for worlds with\nan atmosphere similar to Terra's as necessary as that of man. For in\nspite of their grotesque insectile bodies, their wholly alien minds, the\nThrogs were warm-blooded, oxygen-breathing creatures.\n\nAfter the first few clashes the early Terran explorers had endeavored to\npromote a truce between the species, only to discover that between Throg\nand man there appeared to be no meeting ground at all--total differences\nof mental processes producing insurmountable misunderstanding. There was\nsimply no point of communication. So the Terrans had suffered one\nsmarting defeat after another until they perfected the grid. And now\ntheir colonies were safe, at least when time worked in their favor.\n\nIt had not on Warlock.\n\nA last vivid lash of red cracked over the huddle of domes in the valley.\nShann blinked, half blinded by that glare. His jaws ached as he\nunclenched his teeth. That was the finish. Breathing raggedly, he raised\nhis head, beginning to realize that he was the only one of his kind left\nalive on a none-too-hospitable world controlled by enemies--without\nshelter or supplies.\n\nHe edged back into the narrow cleft which was the entrance to the ledge.\nAs a representative of his species he was not impressive, and now with\nthose shudders he could not master, shaking his thin body, he looked\neven smaller and more vulnerable. Shann drew his knees up close under\nhis chin. The hood of his woodsman's jacket was pushed back in spite of\nthe chill of the morning, and he wiped the back of his hand across his\nlips and chin in an oddly childish gesture.\n\nNone of the men below who had been alive only minutes earlier had been\nclose friends of his; Shann had never known anyone but acquaintances in\nhis short, roving life. Most people had ignored him completely except to\ngive orders, and one or two had been actively malicious--like Garth\nThorvald. Shann grimaced at a certain recent memory, and then that\ngrimace faded into wonder. If young Thorvald hadn't purposefully tried\nto get Shann into trouble by opening the wolverines' cage, Shann\nwouldn't be here now--alive and safe for a time--he'd have been down\nthere with the others.\n\nThe wolverines! For the first time since Shann had heard the crackle of\nthe Throg attack he remembered the reason he had been heading into the\nhills. Of all the men on the Survey team, Shann Lantee had been the\nleast important. The dirty, tedious clean-up jobs, the dull routines\nwhich required no technical training but which had to be performed to\nkeep the camp functioning comfortably, those had been his portion. And\nhe had accepted that status willingly, just to have a chance to be\nincluded among Survey personnel. Not that he had the slightest hope of\nclimbing up to even an S-E-Three rating in the service.\n\nPart of those menial activities had been to clean the animal cages. And\nthere Shann Lantee had found something new, something so absorbing that\nmost of the tiring dull labor had ceased to exist except as tasks to\nfinish before he could return to the fascination of the animal runs.\n\nSurvey teams had early discovered the advantage of using mutated and\nhighly trained Terran animals as assistants in the exploration of\nstrange worlds. From the biological laboratories and breeding farms on\nTerra came a trickle of specialized aides-de-camp to accompany man into\nspace. Some were fighters, silent, more deadly than weapons a man wore\nat his belt or carried in his hands. Some were keener eyes, keener\nnoses, keener scouts than the human kind could produce. Bred for\nintelligence, for size, for adaptability to alien conditions, the animal\nexplorers from Terra were prized.\n\nWolverines, the ancient \"devils\" of the northlands on Terra, were being\ntried for the first time on Warlock. Their caution, a quality highly\ndeveloped in their breed, made them testers for new territory. Able to\ntackle in battle an animal three times their size, they should be added\nprotection for the man they accompanied into the wilderness, and their\nwide ranging, their ability to climb and swim, and above all, their\ncuriosity were assets.\n\nShann had begun contact by cleaning their cages; he ended captivated by\nthese miniature bears with long bushy tails. And to his unbounded\ndelight the attraction was mutual. Alone to Taggi and Togi he was a\nperson, an important person. Those teeth, which could tear flesh into\nragged strips, nipped gently at his fingers, closed without any pressure\non arm, even on nose and chin in what was the ultimate caress of their\nkind. Since they were escape artists of no mean ability, twice he had\nhad to track and lead them back to camp from forays of their own\ndevising.\n\nBut the second time he had been caught by Fadakar, the chief of animal\ncontrol, before he could lock up the delinquents. And the memory of the\nresulting interview still had the power to make him flush with impotent\nanger. Shann's explanation had been contemptuously brushed aside, and he\nhad been delivered an ultimatum. If his carelessness occurred again, he\nwould be sent back on the next supply ship, to be dismissed without an\nofficial sign-off on his work record, thus locked out of even the lowest\nlevel of Survey for the rest of his life.\n\nThat was why Garth Thorvald's act of the night before had made Shann\nbrave the unknown darkness of Warlock alone when he had discovered that\nthe test animals were gone. He had to locate and return them before\nFadakar made his morning inspection; Garth Thorvald's attempt to get him\ninto bad trouble had saved his life.\n\nShann cowered back, striving to make his huddled body as small as\npossible. One of the Throg flyers appeared silently out of the misty\namber of the morning sky, hovering over the silent camp. The aliens were\ncoming in to inspect the site of their victory. And the safest place for\nany Terran now was as far from the vicinity of those silent domes as he\ncould get. Shann's slight body was an asset as he wedged through the\nnarrow mouth of a cleft and so back into the cliff wall. The climb\nbefore him he knew in part, for this was the path the wolverines had\nfollowed on their two other escapes. A few moments of tricky scrambling\nand he was out in a cuplike depression choked with brush covered with\nthe purplish foliage of Warlock. On the other side of that was a small\ncut to a sloping hillside, giving on another valley, not as wide as that\nin which the camp stood, but one well provided with cover in the way of\ntrees and high-growing bushes.\n\nA light wind pushed among the trees, and twice Shann heard the harsh,\nrasping call of a clak-clak--one of the bat-like leather-winged flyers\nthat laired in pits along the cliff walls. That present snap of two-tone\ncomplaint suggested that the land was empty of strangers. For the\nclak-claks vociferously and loudly resented encroachment on their chosen\nhunting territory.\n\nShann hesitated. He was driven by the urge to put as much distance\nbetween him and the landing Throg ship as he could. But to arouse the\nattention of inquisitive clak-claks was asking for trouble. Perhaps it\nwould be best to keep on along the top of the cliff, rather than risk a\ndescent to take cover in the valley the flyers patrolled.\n\nA patch of dust, sheltered by a tooth-shaped projection of rock, gave\nthe Terran his first proof that Taggi and his mate had preceded him, for\nprinted firmly there was the familiar paw mark of a wolverine. Shann\nbegan to hope that both animals had taken to cover in the wilderness\nahead.\n\nHe licked dry lips. Having left secretly without any emergency pack, he\nhad no canteen, and now Shann inventoried his scant possessions--a field\nkit, heavy-duty clothing, a short hooded jacket with attached mittens,\nthe breast marked with the Survey insignia. His belt supported a\nsheathed stunner and bush knife, and seam pockets held three credit\ntokens, a twist of wire intended to reinforce the latch of the wolverine\ncage, a packet of bravo tablets, two identity and work cards, and a\nlength of cord. No rations--save the bravos--no extra charge for his\nstunner. But he did have, weighing down a loop on the jacket, a small\natomic torch.\n\nThe path he followed ended abruptly in a cliff drop, and Shann made a\nface at the odor rising from below, even though that scent meant he\ncould climb down to the valley floor here without fearing any clak-clak\nattention. Chemical fumes from a mineral spring funneled against the\nwall, warding off any nesting in this section.\n\nShann drew up the hood of his jacket and snapped the transparent face\nmask into place. He must get away--then find food, water, a hiding\nplace. That will to live which had made Shann Lantee fight innumerable\nbattles in the past was in command, bracing him with a stubborn\ndetermination.\n\nThe fumes swirled up in a smoke haze about his waist, but he strode on,\nheading for the open valley and cleaner air. That sickly lavender\nvegetation bordering the spring deepened in color to the normal\npurple-green, and then he was in a grove of trees, their branches\npointed skyward at sharp angles to the rust-red trunks.\n\nA small skitterer burst from moss-spotted ground covering, giving an\nalarmed squeak, skimming out of sight as suddenly as it had appeared.\nShann squeezed between two trees and then paused. The trunk of the\nlarger was deeply scored with scratches dripping viscid gobs of sap, a\nsap which was a bright froth of scarlet. Taggi had left his mark here,\nand not too long ago.\n\nThe soft carpet of moss showed no paw marks, but he thought he knew the\ngoal of the animals--a lake down-valley. Shann was beginning to plan\nnow. The Throgs had not blasted the Terran camp out of existence; they\nhad only made sure of the death of its occupiers. Which meant they must\nhave some use for the installations. For the general loot of a Survey\nfield camp would be relatively worthless to those who picked over the\ntreasure of entire cities elsewhere. Why? What did the Throgs want? And\nwould the alien invaders continue to occupy the domes for long?\n\nShann did not realize what had happened to him since that shock of\nruthless attack. From early childhood, when he had been thrown on his\nown to scratch a living--a borderline existence of a living--on the\nDumps of Tyr, he had had to use his wits to keep life in a scrawny and\nundersized body. However, since he had been eating regularly from Survey\nrations, he was not quite so scrawny any more.\n\nHis formal education was close to zero, his informal and off-center\nschooling vast. And that particular toughening process which had been\nworking on him for years now aided in his speedy adaption to a new set\nof facts, formidable ones. He was alone on a strange and perhaps hostile\nworld. Water, food, safe shelter, those were important now. And once\nagain, away from the ordered round of the camp where he had been ruled\nby the desires and requirements of others, he was thinking, planning in\nfreedom. Later (his hand went to the butt of his stunner) perhaps later\nhe might just find a way of extracting an accounting from the\nbeetle-faces, too.\n\nFor the present, he would have to keep away from the Throgs, which meant\nwell away from the camp. A fleck of green showed through the amethyst\nfoliage before him--the lake! Shann wriggled through a last bush barrier\nand stood to look out over that surface. A sleek brown head bobbed up.\nShann put fingers to his mouth and whistled. The head turned, black\nbutton eyes regarded him, short legs began to churn water. To his\ngratification the swimmer was obeying his summons.\n\nTaggi came ashore, pausing on the fine gray sand of the verge to shake\nhimself vigorously. Then the wolverine came upslope at a clumsy gallop\nto Shann. With an unknown feeling swelling inside him, the Terran went\ndown on both knees, burying both hands in the coarse brown fur, warming\nto the uproarious welcome Taggi gave him.\n\n\"Togi?\" Shann asked as if the other could answer. He gazed back to the\nlake, but Taggi's mate was nowhere in sight.\n\nThe blunt head under his hand swung around, black button nose pointed\nnorth. Shann had never been sure just how intelligent, as mankind\nmeasured intelligence, the wolverines were. He had come to suspect that\nFadakar and the other experts had underrated them and that both beasts\nunderstood more than they were given credit for. Now he followed an\nexperiment of his own, one he had had a chance to try only a few times\nbefore and never at length. Pressing his palm flat on Taggi's head,\nShann thought of Throgs and of their attack, trying to arouse in the\nanimal a corresponding reaction to his own horror and anger.\n\nAnd Taggi responded. A mutter became a growl, teeth gleamed--those cruel\nteeth of a carnivore to whom they were weapons of aggression. Danger ...\nShann thought \"danger.\" Then he raised his hand, and the wolverine\nshuffled off, heading north. The man followed.\n\nThey discovered Togi busy in a small cove where a jagged tangle of drift\nmade a mat dating from the last high-water period. She was finishing a\nhearty breakfast, the remains of a water rat being buried thriftily\nagainst future need after the instincts of her kind. When she was done\nshe came to Shann, inquiry plain to read in her eyes.\n\nThere was water here, and good hunting. But the site was too close to\nthe Throgs. Let one of their exploring flyers sight them, and the little\ngroup was finished. Better cover, that's what the three fugitives must\nhave. Shann scowled, not at Togi, but at the landscape. He was tired and\nhungry, but he must keep on going.\n\nA stream fed into the cove from the west, a guide of sorts. With very\nlittle knowledge of the countryside, Shann was inclined to follow that.\n\nOverhead the sun made its usual golden haze of the sky. A flight of\nvivid green streaks marked a flock of lake ducks coming for a morning\nfeeding. Lake duck was good eating, but Shann had no time to hunt one\nnow. Togi started down the bank of the stream, Taggi behind her. Either\nthey had caught his choice subtly through some undefined mental contact,\nor they had already picked that road on their own.\n\nShann's attention was caught by a piece of the drift. He twisted the\nlength free and had his first weapon of his own manufacture, a club.\nUsing it to hold back a low sweeping branch, he followed the wolverines.\n\nWithin the half hour he had breakfast, too. A pair of limp skitterers,\ntheir long hind feet lashed together with a thong of grass, hung from\nhis belt. They were not particularly good eating, but they were meat and\nacceptable.\n\nThe three, man and wolverines, made their way up the stream to the\nvalley wall and through a feeder ravine into the larger space beyond.\nThere, where the stream was born at the foot of a falls, they made their\nfirst camp. Judging that the morning haze would veil any smoke, Shann\nbuilt a pocket-size fire. He seared rather than roasted the skitterers\nafter he had made an awkward and messy business of skinning them, and\ntore the meat from the delicate bones in greedy mouthfuls. The\nwolverines lay side by side on the gravel, now and again raising a head\nalertly to test the scent on the air, or gaze into the distance.\n\nTaggi made a warning sound deep in the throat. Shann tossed handfuls of\nsand over the dying fire. He had only time to fling himself face-down,\nhoping the drab and weathered cloth of his uniform faded into the color\nof the earth on which he lay, every muscle tense.\n\nA shadow swung across the hillside. Shann's shoulders hunched, and he\ncowered again. That terror he had known on the ledge was back in full\nforce as he waited for the beam to lick at him as it had earlier at his\nfellows. The Throgs were on the hunt....\n\n\n\n\n2. DEATH OF A SHIP\n\n\nThat sigh of displaced air was not as loud as a breeze, but it echoed\nmonstrously in Shann's ears. He could not believe in his luck as that\nsound grew fainter, drew away into the valley he had just left. With\ninfinite caution he raised his head from his arm, still hardly able to\naccept the fact that he had not been sighted, that the Throgs and their\nflyer were gone.\n\nBut that black plate was spinning out into the sun haze. One of the\nbeetles might have suspected that there were Terran fugitives and\nordered a routine patrol. After all, how could the aliens know that they\nhad caught all but one of the Survey party in camp? Though with all the\nTerran scout flitters grounded on the field, the men dead in their\nbunks, the surprise would seem to be complete.\n\nAs Shann moved, Taggi and Togi came to life also. They had gone to earth\nwith speed, and the man was sure that both beasts had sensed danger. Not\nfor the first time he knew a burning desire for the formal education he\nhad never had. In camp he had listened, dragging out routine jobs in\norder to overhear reports and the small talk of specialists keen on\ntheir own particular hobbies. But so much of the information Shann had\nthus picked up to store in a retentive memory he had not understood and\ncould not fit together. It had been as if he were trying to solve some\nhighly important puzzle with at least a quarter of the necessary pieces\nmissing, or with unrelated bits from others intermixed. How much control\ndid a trained animal scout have over his furred or feathered\nassistants? And was part of that mastery a mental rapport built up\nbetween man and animal?\n\nHow well would the wolverines obey him now, especially when they would\nnot return to camp where cages stood waiting as symbols of human\nauthority? Wouldn't a trek into the wilderness bring about a revolt for\ncomplete freedom? If Shann could depend upon the animals, it would mean\na great deal. Not only would their superior hunting ability provide all\nthree with food, but their scouting senses, so much keener than his,\nmight erect a slender wall between life and death.\n\nFew large native beasts had been discovered on Warlock by the Terran\nexplorers. And of those four or five different species, none had proved\nhostile if unprovoked. But that did not mean that somewhere back in the\nwild lands into which Shann was heading there were no heretofore\nunknowns, perhaps slyer and as vicious as the wolverines when they were\naroused to rage.\n\nThen there were the \"dreams,\" which had afforded the prime source of\ncamp discussion and dispute. Shann brushed coarse sand from his boots\nand thought about the dreams. Did they or did they not exist? You could\nstart an argument any time by making a definite statement for or against\nthe peculiar sort of dreaming reported by the first scout to set ship on\nthis world.\n\nThe Circe system, of which Warlock was the second of three planets, had\nfirst been scouted four years ago by one of those explorers traveling\nsolo in Survey service. Everyone knew that the First-In Scouts were a\nweird breed, almost a mutation of Terran stock--their reports were rife\nwith strange observations.\n\nSo an alarming one concerning Circe (a yellow sun such as Sol) and her\nthree planets was not so rare. Witch, the world nearest in orbit to\nCirce, was too hot for human occupancy without drastic and too costly\nworld-changing. Wizard, the third out from the sun, was mostly bare rock\nand highly poisonous water. But Warlock, swinging through space between\ntwo forbidding neighbors, seemed to be just what the settlement board\nordered.\n\nThen the Survey scout, even in the cocoon safety of his well-armed ship,\nbegan to dream. And from those dreams a horror of the apparently empty\nworld developed, until he fled the planet to preserve his sanity. There\nhad been a second visit to Warlock in check; worlds so well adapted to\nhuman emigration could not be lightly thrown away. And this time there\nwas a negative report, no trace of dreams, no registration of any\noutside influence on the delicate and complicated equipment the ship\ncarried. So the Survey team had been dispatched to prepare for the\ncoming of the first pioneers, and none of them had dreamed either--at\nleast, no more than the ordinary dreams all men accepted.\n\nOnly there were those who pointed out that the seasons had changed\nbetween the first and second visits to Warlock. That first scout had\nplaneted in summer; his successors had come in fall and winter. They\nargued that the final release of the world for settlement should not be\ngiven until the full year on Warlock had been sampled.\n\nBut the pressure of Emigrant Control had forced their hands, that and\nthe fear of just what had eventually happened--an attack from the\nThrogs. So they had speeded up the process of declaring Warlock open.\nOnly Ragnar Thorvald had protested that decision up to the last and had\ngone back to headquarters on the supply ship a month ago to make a last\nappeal for a more careful study.\n\nShann stopped brushing the sand from the tough fabric above his knee.\nRagnar Thorvald ... He remembered back to the port landing apron on\nanother world, remembered with a sense of loss he could not define. That\nhad been about the second biggest day of his short life; the biggest had\ncome earlier when they had actually allowed him to sign on for Survey\nduty.\n\nHe had tumbled off the cross-continent cargo carrier, his kit--a very\nmeager kit--slung over his thin shoulder, a hot eagerness expanding\ninside him until he thought that he could not continue to throttle down\nthat wild happiness. There was a waiting starship. And he--Shann Lantee\nfrom the Dumps of Tyr, without any influence or schooling--was going to\nblast off in her, wearing the brown-green uniform of Survey!\n\nThen he had hesitated uncertainly, had not quite dared cross the few\nfeet of apron lying between him and that compact group wearing the same\nuniform--with a slight difference, that of service bars and completion\nbadges and rank insignia--with the unconscious self-assurance of men who\nhad done this many times before.\n\nBut after a moment that whole group had become in his own shy appraisal\njust a background for one man. Shann had never before known in his\npinched and limited childhood, his lost boyhood, anyone who aroused in\nhim hero worship. And he could not have put a name to the new emotion\nthat added so suddenly to his burning desire to make good, not only to\nhold the small niche in Survey which he had already so painfully\nachieved, but to climb, until he could stand so in such a group talking\neasily to that tall man, his uncovered head bronze-yellow in the\nsunlight, his cool gray eyes pale in his brown face.\n\nNot that any of those wild dreams born in that minute or two had been\nrealized in the ensuing months. Probably those dreams had always been as\nwild as the ones reported by the first scout on Warlock. Shann grinned\nwryly now at the short period of childish hope and half-confidence that\nhe could do big things. Only one Thorvald had ever noticed Shann's\nexistence in the Survey camp, and that had been Garth.\n\nGarth Thorvald, a far less impressive--one could say \"smudged\"--copy of\nhis brother. Swaggering with an arrogance Ragnar never showed, Garth was\na cadet on his first mission, intent upon making Shann realize the\nunbridgeable gulf between a labor hand and an officer-to-be. He had\nappeared to know right from their first meeting just how to make Shann's\nlife a misery.\n\nNow, in this slit of valley well away from the domes, Shann's fists\nballed. He pounded them against the earth in a way he had so often hoped\nto plant them on Garth's smoothly handsome face, his well-muscled body.\nOne didn't survive the Dumps of Tyr without learning how to use fists,\nand boots, and a list of tricks they didn't teach in any academy. He had\nalways been sure that he could take Garth if they mixed it up. But if he\nhad loosed the tight rein he had kept on his temper and offered that\nchallenge, he would have lost his chance with Survey. Garth had proved\nhimself able to talk his way out of any scrape, even minor derelictions\nof duty, and he far out-ranked Shann. The laborer from Tyr had had to\nswallow all that the other could dish out and hope that on his next\nassignment he would not be a member of young Thorvald's team. Though,\nbecause of Garth Thorvald, Shann's toll of black record marks had\nmounted dangerously high and each day the chance for any more duty tours\nhad grown dimmer.\n\nShann laughed, and the sound was ugly. That was one thing he didn't have\nto worry about any longer. There would be no other assignments for him,\nthe Throgs had seen to that. And Garth ... well, there would never be a\nshowdown between them now. He stood up. The Throg ship had disappeared;\nthey could push on.\n\nHe found a break in the cliff wall which was climbable, and he coaxed\nthe wolverines after him. When they stood on the heights from which the\nfalls tumbled, Taggi and Togi rubbed against him, cried for his\nattention. They, too, appeared to need the reassurance they got from\ncontact with him, for they were also fugitives on this alien world, the\nonly representatives of their kind.\n\nSince he did not have any definite goal in view, Shann continued to be\nguided by the stream, following its wanderings across a plateau. The sun\nwas warm, so he carried his jacket slung across one shoulder. Taggi and\nTogi ranged ahead, twice catching skitterers, which they devoured\nvoraciously. A shadow on a sun-baked rock sent the Terran skidding for\ncover until he saw that it was cast by one of the questing falcons from\nthe upper peaks. But that shook his confidence, so he again sought\ncover, ashamed at his own carelessness.\n\nIn the late afternoon he reached the far end of the plateau, faced a\nclimb to peaks which still bore cones of snow, now tinted a soft peach\nby the sun. Shann studied that possible path and distrusted his own\npowers to take it without proper equipment or supplies. He must turn\neither north or south, though he would then have to abandon a sure water\nsupply in the stream. Tonight he would camp where he was. He had not\nrealized how tired he was until he found a likely half-cave in the\nmountain wall and crawled in. There was too much danger in fire here; he\nwould have to do without that first comfort of his kind.\n\nLuckily, the wolverines squeezed in beside him to fill the hole. With\ntheir warm furred bodies sandwiching him, Shann dozed, awoke, and dozed\nagain, listening to night sounds--the screams, cries, hunting calls, of\nthe Warlock wilds. Now and again one of the wolverines whined and moved\nuneasily.\n\nFingers of sun picked at Shann through a shaft among the rocks, striking\nhis eyes. He moved, blinked blearily awake, unable for the first few\nseconds to understand why the smooth plasta wall of his bunk had become\nrough red stone. Then he remembered. He was alone and he threw himself\nfrantically out of the cave, afraid the wolverines had wandered off.\nOnly both animals were busy clawing under a boulder with a steady\npersistence which argued there was a purpose behind that effort.\n\nA sharp sting on the back of one hand made that purpose only too clear\nto Shann, and he retreated hurriedly from the vicinity of the\nexcavation. They had found an earth-wasp's burrow and were hunting\ngrubs, naturally arousing the rightful inhabitants to bitter resentment.\n\nShann faced the problem of his own breakfast. He had had the immunity\nshots given to all members of the team, and he had eaten game brought in\nby exploring parties and labeled \"safe.\" But how long he could keep to\nthe varieties of native food he knew was uncertain. Sooner or later he\nmust experiment for himself. Already he drank the stream water without\nthe aid of purifiers, and so far there had been no ill results from that\nnecessary recklessness. Now the stream suggested fish. But instead he\nchanced upon another water inhabitant which had crawled up on land for\nsome obscure purpose of its own. It was a sluggish scaled thing, an easy\nvictim to his club, with thin, weak legs it could project at will from a\nfinned and armor-plated body.\n\nShann offered the head and guts to Togi, who had abandoned the wasp\nnest. She sniffed in careful investigation and then gulped. Shann built\na small fire and seared the firm greenish flesh. The taste was flat,\nlacking salt, but the food eased his emptiness. Enheartened, he started\nsouth, hoping to find water sometime during the morning.\n\nBy noon he had his optimism justified with the discovery of a spring,\nand the wolverines had brought down a slender-legged animal whose coat\nwas close in shade to the dusky purple of the vegetation. Smaller than a\nTerran deer, its head bore, not horns, but a ridge of stiffened hair\nrising in a point some twelve inches about the skull dome. Shann haggled\noff some ragged steaks while the wolverines feasted in earnest,\ncarefully burying the head afterward.\n\nIt was when Shann knelt by the spring pool to wash that he caught the\nclamor of the clak-claks. He had seen or heard nothing of the flyers\nsince he had left the lake valley. But from the noise now rising in an\nearsplitting volume, he thought there was a sizable colony near-by and\nthat the inhabitants were thoroughly aroused.\n\nHe crept on his hands and knees to near-by brush cover, heading toward\nthe source of that outburst. If the claks were announcing a Throg\nscouting party, he wanted to know it.\n\nLying flat, with branches forming a screen over him, the Terran gazed\nout on a stretch of grassland which sloped at a fairly steep angle to\nthe south and which must lead to a portion of countryside well below the\nlevel he was now traversing.\n\nThe clak-claks were skimming back and forth, shrieking their staccato\nwar cries. Following the erratic dashes of their flight formation,\nShann decided that whatever they railed against was on the lower level,\nout of his sight from that point. Should he simply withdraw, since the\ndisturbance was not near him? Prudence dictated that; yet still he\nhesitated.\n\nHe had no desire to travel north, or to try and scale the mountains. No,\nsouth was his best path, and he should be very sure that route was\nclosed before he retreated.\n\nSince any additional fuss the clak-claks might make on sighting him\nwould be undistinguished in their now general clamor, the Terran crawled\non to where tall grass provided a screen at the top of the slope. There\nhe stopped short, his hands digging into the earth in sudden braking\naction.\n\nBelow, the ground steamed from a rocket flare-back, grasses burned away\nfrom the fins of a small scoutship. But even as Shann rose to one knee,\nhis shout of welcome choked in his throat. One of those fins sank,\ncanting the ship crookedly, preventing any new take-off. And over the\ncrown of a low hill to the west swung the ominous black plate of a Throg\nflyer.\n\nThe Throg ship came up in a burst of speed, and Shann waited tensely for\nsome countermove from the scout. Those small speedy Terran ships were\nprudently provided with weapons triply deadly in proportion to their\nsize. He was sure that the Terran ship could hold its own against the\nThrog, even eliminate the enemy. But there was no fire from the slanting\npencil of the scout. The Throg circled warily, obviously expecting a\ntrap. Twice it darted back in the direction from which it had come. As\nit returned from its second retreat, another of its kind showed, a black\ncoin dot against the amber of the sky.\n\nShann felt sick inside. Now the Terran scout had lost any advantage and\nperhaps all hope. The Throgs could box the other in, cut the downed ship\nto pieces with their energy beams. He wanted to crawl away and not\nwitness this last disaster for his kind. But some stubborn core of will\nkept him where he was.\n\nThe Throgs began to circle while beneath them the flock of clak-claks\nscreamed and dived at the slanting nose of the Terran ship. Then that\nsame slashing energy he had watched quarter the camp snapped from the\nfar plate across the stricken scout. The man who had piloted her, if not\ndead already (which might account for the lack of defense), must have\nfallen victim to that. But the Throg was going to make very sure. The\nsecond flyer halted, remaining poised long enough to unleash a second\nbolt--dazzling any watching eyes and broadcasting a vibration to make\nShann's skin crawl when the last faint ripple reached his lookout post.\n\nWhat happened then the overconfident Throg was not prepared to take.\nShann cried out, burying his face on his arm, as pinwheels of scarlet\nlight blotted out normal sight. There was an explosion, a deafening\nblast. He cowered, blind, unable to hear. Then, rubbing at his eyes, he\ntried to see what had happened.\n\nThrough watery blurs he made out the Throg ship, not swinging now in\nserene indifference to Warlock's gravity, but whirling end over end\nacross the sky as might a leaf tossed in a gust of wind. Its rim caught\nagainst a rust-red cliff, it rebounded and crumpled. Then it came down,\nsmashing perhaps half a mile away from the smoking crater in which lay\nthe mangled wreckage of the Terran ship. The disabled scout pilot must\nhave played a last desperate game, making of his ship bait for a trap.\n\nThe Terran had taken one Throg with him. Shann rubbed again at his eyes,\njust barely able to catch a glimpse of the second ship flashing away\nwestward. Perhaps it was only his impaired sight, but it appeared to him\nthat the Throg followed an erratic path, either as if the pilot feared\nto be caught by a second shot, or because that ship had also suffered\nsome injury.\n\nAcid smoke wreathed up from the valley making Shann retch and cough.\nThere could be no survivor from the Terran scout, and he did not believe\nthat any Throg had lived to crawl free of the crumpled plate. But there\nwould be other beetles swarming here soon. They would not dare to leave\nthe scene unsearched. He wondered about that scout. Had the pilot been\naiming for the Survey camp, the absence of any rider beam from there\nwarning him off so that he made the detour which brought him here? Or\nhad the Throgs tried to blast the Terran ship in the upper atmosphere,\ncrippling it, making this a forced landing? But at least this battle had\ncost the Throgs, settling a small portion of the Terran debt for the\nlost camp.\n\nThe length of time between Shann's sighting of the grounded ship and the\nattack by the Throgs had been so short that he had not really developed\nany strong hope of rescue to be destroyed by the end of the crippled\nship. On the other hand, seeing the Throgs take a beating had exploded\nhis subconscious acceptance of their superiority. He might not have even\nthe resources of a damaged scout at his command. But he did have Taggi,\nTogi, and his own brain. Since he was fated to permanent exile on\nWarlock, there might just be some way to make the beetles pay for that.\n\nHe licked his lips. Real action against the aliens would take a lot of\nplanning. Shann would have to know more about what made a Throg a Throg,\nmore than all the wild stories he had heard over the years. There _had_\nto be some way a Terran could move effectively against a beetle-head.\nAnd he had a lot of time, maybe the rest of his life to work out a few\nanswers. That Throg ship lying wrecked at the foot of the cliff ...\nperhaps he could do a little investigating before any rescue squad\narrived. Shann decided such a move was worth the try and whistled to the\nwolverines.\n\n\n\n\n3. TO CLOSE RANKS\n\n\nShann made his way at an angle to avoid the smoking pit cradling the\nwreckage of the Terran ship. There were no signs of life about the Throg\nplate as he approached. A quarter of its bulk was telescoped back into\nthe rest, and surely none of the aliens could have survived such a\nsmash, tough as they were reputed to be with those horny carapaces\nserving them in place of more vulnerable human skin.\n\nHe sniffed. There was a nauseous odor heavy on the morning air, one\nwhich would make a lasting impression on any human nose. The port door\nin the black ship stood open, perhaps having burst in the impact against\nthe cliff. Shann had almost reached it when a crackle of chain lightning\nbeat across the ground before him, turning the edge of the buckled\nentrance panel red.\n\nShann dropped to the ground, drawing his stunner, knowing at the same\nmoment that such a weapon was about as much use in meeting a blaster as\na straw wand would be to ward off a blazing coal. A chill numbness held\nhim as he waited for a second blast to charr the flesh between his\nshoulders. So there had been a Throg survivor, after all.\n\nBut as moments passed and the Throg did not move in to make an easy\nkill, Shann collected his wits. Only one shot! Was the beetle injured,\nunable to make sure of even an almost defenseless prey? The Throgs\nseldom took prisoners. When they did....\n\nThe Terran's lips tightened. He worked his hand under his prone body,\nfeeling for the hilt of his knife. With that he could speedily remove\nhimself from the status of Throg prisoner, and he would do it gladly if\nthere was no hope of escape. Had there been only one charge left in that\nblaster? Shann could make half a dozen guesses as to why the other had\nmade no move, but that shot had come from behind him, and he dared not\nturn his head or otherwise make an effort to see what the other might be\ndoing.\n\nWas it only his imagination, or had that stench grown stronger during\nthe last few seconds? Could the Throg be creeping up on him? Shann\nstrained his ears, trying to catch some sound he could interpret. The\nfew clak-claks that had survived the blast about the ship were shrieking\noverhead, and Shann made one attempt at counterattack.\n\nHe whistled the wolverines' call. The pair had not been too willing to\nfollow him down into this valley, and they had avoided the crater at a\nvery wide circle. But if they would obey him now, he just might have a\nchance.\n\nThere! That _had_ been a sound, and the smell _was_ stronger. The Throg\nmust be coming to him. Again Shann whistled, holding in his mind his\nhatred for the beetle-head, the need for finishing off that alien. If\nthe animals could pick either thoughts or emotions out of their human\ncompanion, this was the time for him to get those unspoken half-orders\nacross.\n\nShann slammed his hand hard against the ground, sent his body rolling,\nhis stunner up and ready.\n\nAnd now he could see that grotesque thing, swaying weakly back and forth\non its thin legs, yet holding a blaster, bringing that weapon up to\ncenter it on him. The Throg was hunched over and perhaps to Taggi\npresented the outline of some four-footed creature to be hunted. For the\nwolverine male sprang for the horn-shelled shoulders.\n\nUnder that impact that Throg sagged forward. But Taggi, outraged at the\nnature of creature he had attacked, squalled and retreated. Shann had\nhad his precious seconds of distraction. He fired, the core of the stun\nbeam striking full into the flat dish of the alien's \"face.\"\n\nThat bolt, which would have shocked a mammal into insensibility, only\nslowed the Throg. Shann rolled again, gaining a temporary cover behind\nthe wrecked ship. He squirmed under metal hot enough to scorch his\njacket and saw the reflection of a second blaster shot which had been\nfired seconds late.\n\nNow the Throg had him tied down. But to get at the Terran the alien\nwould have to show himself, and Shann had one chance in fifty, which was\nbetter than that of three minutes ago--when the odds had been set at one\nin a hundred. He knew that he could not press the wolverines in again.\nTaggi's distaste was too manifest; Shann had been lucky that the animal\nhad made one abortive attack.\n\nPerhaps the Terran's escape and Taggi's action had made the alien\nreckless. Shann had no clue to the thinking processes of the non-human,\nbut now the Throg staggered around the end of the plate, his digits,\nwhich were closer to claws than fingers, fumbling with his weapon. The\nTerran snapped another shot from his stunner, hoping to slow the enemy\ndown. But he was trapped. If he turned to climb the cliff at his back,\nthe beetle-head could easily pick him off.\n\nA rock hurtled from the heights above, striking with deadly accuracy on\nthe domed, hairless head of the Throg. His armored body crashed forward,\nstruck against the ship, and rebounded to the ground. Shann darted\nforward to seize the blaster, kicking loose the claws which still\ngrasped it, before he flattened back to the cliff, the strange weapon\nover his arm, his heart beating wildly.\n\nThat rock had not bounded down the mountainside by chance; it had been\nhurled with intent and aimed carefully at its target. And no Throg would\nkill one of his fellows. Or would he? Suppose orders had been issued to\ntake a Terran prisoner and the Throg by the ship had disobeyed? Then,\nwhy a rock and not a blaster bolt?\n\nShann edged along until the upslanted, broken side of the Throg flyer\nprovided him with protection from any overhead attack. Under that\nshelter he waited for the next move from his unknown rescuer.\n\nThe clak-claks wheeled closer to earth. One lit boldly on the carapace\nof the inert Throg, shuffling ungainly along that horny ridge. Cradling\nthe blaster, the Terran continued to wait. His patience was rewarded\nwhen that investigating clak-clak took off uttering an enraged snap or\ntwo. He heard what might be the scrape of boots across rock, but that\nmight also have come from horny skin meeting stone.\n\nThen the other must have lost his footing not too far above. Accompanied\nby a miniature landslide of stones and earth, a figure slid down several\nyards away. Shann waited in a half-crouch, his looted blaster covering\nthe man now getting to his feet. There was no mistaking the familiar\nuniform, or even the man. How Ragnar Thorvald had reached that\nparticular spot on Warlock or why, Shann could not know. But that he was\nthere, there was no denying.\n\nShann hurried forward. It had been when he caught his first sight of\nThorvald that he realized just how deep his unacknowledged loneliness\nhad bit. There were two Terrans on Warlock now, and he did not need to\nknow why. But Thorvald was staring back at him with the blankness of\nnon-recognition.\n\n\"Who are you?\" The demand held something close to suspicion.\n\nThat note in the other's voice wiped away a measure of Shann's\nconfidence, threatened something which had flowered in him since he had\nstruck into the wilderness on his own. Three words had reduced him again\nto Lantee, unskilled laborer.\n\n\"Lantee. I'm from the camp....\"\n\nThorvald's eagerness was plain in his next question: \"How many of you\ngot away? Where are the rest?\" He gazed past Shann up the plateau slope\nas if he expected to see the personnel of the camp sprout out of the\ncloak of grass along the verge.\n\n\"Just me and the wolverines,\" Shann answered in a colorless voice. He\ncradled the blaster on his hip, turned a little away from the officer.\n\n\"You ... and the wolverines?\" Thorvald was plainly startled. \"But ...\nwhere? How?\"\n\n\"The Throgs hit very early yesterday morning. They caught the rest in\ncamp. The wolverines had escaped from their cage, and I was out hunting\nthem....\" He told his story baldly.\n\n\"You're sure about the rest?\" Thorvald had a thin steel of rage edging\nhis voice. Almost, Shann thought, as if he could turn that blade of rage\nagainst one Shann Lantee for being yet alive when more important men had\nnot survived.\n\n\"I saw the attack from an upper ridge,\" the younger man said, having\nbeen put on the defensive. Yet he had a right to be alive, hadn't he? Or\ndid Thorvald believe that he should have gone running down to meet the\nbeetle-heads with his useless stunner? \"They used energy beams ...\ndidn't land until it was all over.\"\n\n\"I knew there was something wrong when the camp didn't answer our\nenter-atmosphere signal,\" Thorvald said absently. \"Then one of those\nplatters jumped us on braking orbit, and my pilot was killed. When we\nset down on the automatics here I had just time to rig a surprise for\nany trackers before I took to the hills----\"\n\n\"The blast got one of them,\" Shann pointed out.\n\n\"Yes, they'd nicked the booster rocket; she wouldn't climb again. But\nthey'll be back here to pick over the remains.\"\n\nShann looked at the dead Throg. \"Thanks for taking a hand.\" His tone was\nas chill as the other's this time. \"I'm heading south....\"\n\nAnd, he added silently, I intend to keep on that way. The Throg attack\nhad dissolved the pattern of the Survey team. He didn't owe Thorvald any\nallegiance. And he had been successfully on his own here since the camp\nhad been overrun.\n\n\"South,\" Thorvald repeated. \"Well, that's as good a direction as any\nright now.\"\n\nBut they were not united. Shann found the wolverines and patiently\ncoaxed and wheedled them into coming with him over a circuitous route\nwhich kept them away from both ships. Thorvald went up the cliff, swung\ndown again, a supply bag slung over one shoulder. He stood watching as\nShann brought the animals in.\n\nThen Thorvald's arm swept out, his fingers closing possessively about\nthe barrel of the blaster. Shann's own hold on the weapon tightened, and\nthe force of the other's pull dragged him partly around.\n\n\"Let's have that----\"\n\n\"Why?\" Shann supposed that because it had been the other's well-aimed\nrock which had put the Throg out of commission permanently, the officer\nwas going to claim their only spoils of war as personal booty, and a hot\nresentment flowered in the younger man.\n\n\"We don't take that away from here.\" Thorvald made the weapon his with a\nquick twist.\n\nTo Shann's utter astonishment, the Survey officer walked back to kneel\nbeside the dead Throg. He worked the grip of the blaster under the\nalien's lax claws and inspected the result with the care of one\narranging a special and highly important display. Shann's protest became\nvocal. \"We'll need that!\"\n\n\"It'll do us far more good right where it is....\" Thorvald paused and\nthen added, with impatience roughening his voice as if he disliked the\nneed for making any explanations, \"There is no reason for us to\nadvertise our being alive. If the Throgs found a blaster missing, they'd\nstart thinking and looking around. I want to have a breathing spell\nbefore I have to play quarry in one of their hunts.\"\n\nPut that way, his action did make sense. But Shann regretted the loss of\nan arm so superior to their own weapons. Now they could not loot the\nplateship either. In silence he turned and started to trudge southward,\nwithout waiting for Thorvald to catch up with him.\n\nOnce away from the blasted area, the wolverines ranged ahead at their\nclumsy gallop, which covered ground at a surprising rate of speed. Shann\nknew that their curiosity made them scouts surpassing any human and that\nthe men who followed would have ample warning of any danger to come.\nWithout reference to his silent trail companion, he sent the animals\ntoward another strip of woodland which would give them cover against the\ncoming of any Throg flyer.\n\nAs the hours advanced he began to cast about for a proper night camp.\nThe woods ought to give them a usable site.\n\n\"This is a water wood,\" Thorvald said, breaking the silence for the\nfirst time since they had left the wrecks.\n\nShann knew that the other had knowledge, not only of the general\ncountryside, but of exploring techniques which he himself did not\npossess, but to be reminded of that fact was an irritant rather than a\nreassurance. Without answering, the younger man bored on to locate the\nwater promised.\n\nThe wolverines found the small lake first and were splashing along its\nshore when the Terrans caught up. Thorvald went to work, but to Shann's\nsurprise he did not unstrap the force-blade ax at his belt. Bending over\na sapling, he pounded away with a stone at the green wood a few inches\nabove the root line until he was able to break through the slender\ntrunk. Shann drew his own knife and bent to tackle another treelet when\nThorvald stopped him with an order: \"Use a stone on that, the way I\ndid.\"\n\nShann could see no reason for such a laborious process. If Thorvald did\nnot want to use his ax, that was no reason that Shann could not put his\nheavy belt knife to work. He hesitated, ready to set the blade to the\nouter bark of the tree.\n\n\"Look--\" again that impatient edge in the officer's tone, the need for\nexplanation seeming to come very hard to the other--\"sooner or later the\nThrogs might just trace us here and find this camp. If so, they are\n_not_ going to discover any traces to label us Terran----\"\n\n\"But who else could we be?\" protested Shann. \"There is no native race on\nWarlock.\"\n\nThorvald tossed his improvised stone ax from hand to hand.\n\n\"But do the Throgs know that?\"\n\nThe implications, the possibilities, in that idea struck home to Shann.\nNow he began to understand what Thorvald might be planning.\n\n\"Now there is going to be a native race.\" Shann made a statement instead\nof a question and saw that the other was watching him with a new\nintentness, as if he had at last been recognized as a person instead of\nrank and file and very low rank at that--Survey personnel.\n\n\"There is going to be a native race,\" Thorvald affirmed.\n\nShann resheathed his knife and went to search the pond beach for a\nsuitable stone to use in its place. Even so, he made harder work of the\nclumsy chopping than Thorvald had. He worried at one sapling after\nanother until his hands were skinned and his breath came in painful\ngusts from under aching ribs. Thorvald had gone on to another task,\nripping the end of a long tough vine from just under the powdery surface\nof the thick leaf masses fallen in other years.\n\nWith this the officer lashed together the tops of the poles, having\nplanted their splintered butts in the ground, so that he achieved a\ncrudely conical erection. Leafy branches were woven back and forth\nthrough this framework, with an entrance, through which one might crawl\non hands and knees, left facing the lakeside. The shelter they completed\nwas compact and efficient but totally unlike anything Shann had ever\nseen before, certainly far removed from the domes of the camp. He said\nso, nursing his raw hands.\n\n\"An old form,\" Thorvald replied, \"native to a primitive race on Terra.\nCertainly the beetle-heads haven't come across its like before.\"\n\n\"Are we going to stay here? Otherwise it is pretty heavy work for one\nnight's lodging.\"\n\nThorvald tested the shelter with a sharp shake. The matted leaves\nwhispered, but the framework held.\n\n\"Stage dressing. No, we won't linger here. But it's evidence to support\nour play. Even a Throg isn't dense enough to believe that natives would\nmake a cross-country trip without leaving evidence of their passing.\"\n\nShann sat down with a sigh he made no effort to suppress. He had a\nvision of Thorvald traveling southward, methodically erecting these huts\nhere and there to confound Throgs who might not ever chance upon them.\nBut already the Survey officer was busy with a new problem.\n\n\"We need weapons----\"\n\n\"We have our stunners, a force ax, and our knives,\" Shann pointed out.\nHe did not add, as he would have liked that they could have had a\nblaster.\n\n\"Native weapons,\" Thorvald countered with his usual snap. He went back\nto the beach and crawled about there, choosing and rejecting stones\npicked out of the gravel.\n\nShann scooped out a small pit just before their hut and set about the\nmaking of a pocket-sized fire. He was hungry and looked longingly now\nand again to the supply bag Thorvald had brought with him. Dared he\nrummage in that for rations? Surely the other would be carrying\nconcentrates.\n\n\"Who taught you how to make a fire that way?\" Thorvald was back from the\npond, a selection of round stones about the size of his fist resting\nbetween his chest and his forearm.\n\n\"It's regulation, isn't it?\" Shann countered defensively.\n\n\"It's regulation,\" Thorvald agreed. He set down his stones in a row and\nthen tossed the supply bag over to his companion. \"Too late to hunt\ntonight. But well have to go easy on those rations until we can get\nmore.\"\n\n\"Where?\" Did Thorvald know of some supply cache they could raid?\n\n\"From the Throgs,\" the other answered matter of factly.\n\n\"But they don't eat our kind of food....\"\n\n\"All the more reason for them to leave the camp supplies untouched.\"\n\n\"The camp?\"\n\nFor the first time Thorvald's lips curved in a shadow smile which was\nneither joyous nor warming. \"A native raid on an invaders' camp. What\ncould be more natural? And we'd better make it soon.\"\n\n\"But how can we?\" To Shann what the other proposed was sheer madness.\n\n\"There was once an ancient service corps on Terra,\" Thorvald answered,\n\"which had a motto something like this: 'The improbable we do at once;\nthe impossible takes a little longer.' What did you think we were going\nto do? Sulk around out here in the bush and let the Throgs claim Warlock\nfor one of their pirate bases without opposition?\"\n\nSince that was the only future Shann had visualized, he was ready enough\nto admit the truth, only some shade of tone in the officer's voice kept\nhim from saying so aloud.\n\n\n\n\n4. SORTIE\n\n\nFive days later they came up from the south so that this time Shann's\nview of the Terran camp was from a different angle. At first sight there\nhad been little change in the general scene. He wondered if the aliens\nwere using the Terran dome shelters themselves. Even in the twilight it\nwas easy to pick out such landmarks as the com dome with the shaft of a\nbroadcaster spearing from its top and the greater bulk of the supply\nwarehouse.\n\n\"Two of their small flyers down on the landing field....\" Thorvald\nmaterialized from the shadow, his voice a thread of whisper.\n\nBy Shann's side the wolverines were moving restlessly. Since Taggi's\nattack on the Throg neither beast would venture near any site where they\ncould scent the aliens. This was the nearest point to which the men\ncould urge either animal, which was a disappointment, for the wolverines\nwould have been an excellent addition to the surprise sortie they\nplanned for tonight, halving the danger for the men.\n\nShann ran his fingers across the coarse fur on the animals' shoulders,\nexerting a light pressure to signal them to wait. But he was not sure of\ntheir obedience. The foray was a crazy idea, and Shann wondered again\nwhy he had agreed to it. Yet he had gone along with Thorvald, even\nsuggested a few modifications and additions of his own, such as the\ncontents of the crude leaf sack now resting between his knees.\n\nThorvald flitted away, seeking his own post to the west. Shann was still\nwaiting for the other's signal when there arose from the camp a sound to\nchill the flesh of any listener, a wail which could not have come from\nthe throat of any normal living thing, intelligent being or animal.\nUlulating in ear-torturing intensity, the cry sank to a faint, ominous\necho of itself, to waver up the scale again.\n\nThe wolverines went mad. Shann had witnessed their quick kills in the\nwilds, but this stark ferocity of spitting, howling rage was new. They\nanswered that challenge from the camp, streaking out from under his\nhands. Yet both animals skidded to a stop before they passed the first\ndome and were lost in the gloom. A spark glowed for an instant to his\nright; Thorvald was ready to go, so Shann had no time to try and recall\nthe animals.\n\nHe fumbled for those balls of soaked moss in his leaf bag. The chemical\nsmell from them blotted out that alien mustiness which the wind brought\nfrom the campsite. Shann readied the first sopping mess in his sling,\nsnapped his fire sparker at it, and had the ball awhirl for a toss\nalmost in one continuous movement. The moss burst into fire as it curved\nout and fell.\n\nTo a witness it might have seemed that the missile materialized out of\nthe air, the effect being better than Shann had hoped.\n\nA second ball for the sling--spark ... out ... down. The first had\nsmashed on the ground near the dome of the com station, the force of\nimpact flattening it into a round splatter of now fiercely burning\nmaterial. And his second, carefully aimed, lit two feet beyond.\n\nAnother wail tearing at the nerves. Shann made a third throw, a fourth.\nHe had an audience now. In the light of those pools of fire the Throgs\nwere scuttling back and forth, their hunched bodies casting weird\nshadows on the dome walls. They were making efforts to douse the fires,\nbut Shann knew from careful experimentation that once ignited the stuff\nhe had skimmed from the lip of one of the hot springs would go on\nburning as long as a fraction of its viscid substance remained\nunconsumed.\n\nNow Thorvald had gone into action. A Throg suddenly halted, struggled\nfrantically, and toppled over into the edge of a fire splotch, legs\nlooped together by the coils of the curious weapon Thorvald had put\ntogether on their first night of partnership. Three round stones of\ncomparable weight had each been fastened at the end of a vine cord, and\nthose cords united at a center point. Thorvald had demonstrated the\neffectiveness of his creation by bringing down one of the small \"deer\"\nof the grasslands, an animal normally fleet enough to feel safe from\nboth human and animal pursuit. And those weighted ropes now trapped the\nThrog with the same efficiency.\n\nHaving shot his last fireball, Shann ran swiftly to take up a new\nposition, downgrade and to the east of the domes. Here he put into\naction another of the primitive weapons Thorvald had devised, a spear\nhurled with a throwing stick, giving it double range and twice as\nforceful penetration power. The spears themselves were hardly more than\ncrudely shaped lengths of wood, their points charred in the fire.\nPerhaps these missiles could neither kill nor seriously wound. But more\nthan one thudded home in a satisfactory fashion against the curving back\ncarapace or the softer front parts of a Throg in a manner which\ncertainly shook up and bruised the target. And one of Shann's victims\nwent to the ground, to lie kicking in a way which suggested he had been\nmore than just bruised.\n\nFireballs, spears.... Thorvald had moved too. And now down into the\nsomewhat frantic melee of the aroused camp fell a shower of slim\nweighted reeds, each provided with a clay-ball head. The majority of\nthose balls broke on landing as the Terrans had intended. So, through\nthe beetle smell of the aliens, spread the acrid, throat-parching fumes\nof the hot spring water. Whether those fumes had the same effect upon\nThrog breathing apparatus as they did upon Terran, the attackers could\nnot tell, but they hoped such a bombardment would add to the general\nconfusion.\n\nShann began to space the hurling of his crude spears with more care,\ntrying to place them with all the precision of aim he could muster.\nThere was a limit to their amount of varied ammunition, although they\nhad dedicated every waking moment of the past few days to manufacture\nand testing. Luckily the enemy had had none of their energy beams at the\ndomes. And so far they had made no move to lift their flyers for\nretaliation blasts.\n\nBut the Throgs were pulling themselves into order. Blaster fire cut the\ndusk. Most of the aliens were now flat on the ground, sending a creeping\nline of fire into the perimeter of the camp area. A dark form moved\nbetween Shann and the nearest patch of burning moss. The Terran raised a\nspear to the ready before he caught a whiff of the pungent scent emitted\nby a wolverine hot with battle rage. He whistled coaxingly. With the\nThrogs eager to blast any moving thing, the animals were in danger if\nthey prowled about the scene.\n\nThat blunt head moved. Shann caught the glint of eyes in a furred mask;\nit was either Taggi or his mate. Then a puff of mixed Throng and\nchemical scent from the camp must have reached the wolverine. The animal\ncoughed and fled westward, passing Shann.\n\nHad Thorvald had time and opportunity to make his planned raid on the\nsupply dome? Time during such an embroilment was hard to measure, and\nShann could not be sure. He began to count aloud, slowly, as they had\nagreed. When he reached one hundred he would begin his retreat; on two\nhundred he was to run for it, his goal the river a half mile from the\ncamp.\n\nThe stream would take the fugitives to the sea where fiords cut the\ncoastline into a ragged fringe offering a wealth of hiding places.\nThrogs seldom explored any territory on foot. For them to venture into\nthat maze would be putting themselves at the mercy of the Terrans they\nhunted. And their flyers could comb the air above such a rocky\nwilderness without result.\n\nShann reached the count of one hundred. Twice a blaster bolt singed\nground within distance close enough to make him wince, but most of the\nfire carried well above his head. All of his spears were gone, save for\none he had kept, hoping for a last good target. One of the Throgs who\nappeared to be directing the fire of the others was facing Shann's\nposition. And on pure chance that he might knock out that leader, Shann\nchose him for his victim.\n\nThe Terran had no illusions concerning his own marksmanship. The most he\ncould hope for, he thought, was to have the primitive weapon thud home\npainfully on the other's armored hide. Perhaps, if he were very lucky,\nhe could knock the other from his clawed feet. But that chance which\nhovers over any battlefield turned in Shann's favor. At just the right\nmoment the Throg stretched his head up from the usual hunched position\nwhere the carapace extended over his wide shoulders to protect one of\nthe alien's few vulnerable spots, the soft underside of his throat. And\nthe fire-sharpened point of the spear went deep.\n\nThrogs were mute, or at least none of them had ever uttered a vocal\nsound to be reported by Terrans. This one did not cry out. But he\nstaggered forward, forelimbs up, clawed digits pulling at the wooden pin\ntransfixing his throat just under the mandible-equipped jaw, holding his\nhead at an unnatural angle. Without seeming to notice the others of his\nkind, the Throg came on at a shambling run, straight at Shann as if he\ncould actually see through the dark and had marked down the Terran for\npersonal vengeance. There was something so uncanny about that forward\ndash that Shann retreated. As his hand groped for the knife at his belt\nhis boot heel caught in a tangle of weed and he struggled for balance.\nThe wounded Throg, still pulling at the spear shaft protruding above the\nswelling barrel of his chest, pounded on.\n\nShann sprawled backward and was caught in the elastic embrace of a bush,\nso he did not strike the ground. He fought the grip of prickly branches\nand kicked to gain solid earth under his feet. Then again he heard that\npiercing wail from the camp, as chilling as it had been the first time.\nSpurred by that, he won free. But he could not turn his back on the\nwounded Throg, keeping rather a sidewise retreat.\n\nAlready the alien had reached the dark beyond the rim of the camp. His\nprogress now was marked by the crashing through low brush. Two of the\nThrogs back on the firing line started up after their leader. Shann\ncaught a whiff of their odor as the wounded alien advanced with the\nsingle-mindedness of a robot.\n\nIt would be best to head for the river. Tall grass twisted about the\nTerran's legs as he began to run. In spite of the gloom, he hesitated to\ncross that open space. At night Warlock's peculiar vegetation displayed\na very alien attribute--ten ... twenty varieties of grass, plant, and\ntree emitted a wan phosphorescence, varying in degree, but affording\neach an aura of light. And the path before Shann now was dotted by\nsplotches of that radiance, not as brilliant as the chemical-born flames\nthe attackers had kindled in the camp, but as quick to betray the unwary\nwho passed within their dim circles. And there had never been any reason\nto believe that Throg powers of sight were less than human; there was\nperhaps some evidence to the contrary. Shann crouched, charting the\nclumps ahead for a zigzag course which would take him to at least\nmomentary safety in the river bed.\n\nPerhaps a mile downstream was the transport the Terrans had cobbled\ntogether no earlier than this afternoon, a raft Thorvald had professed\nto believe would support them to the sea which lay some fifty Terran\nmiles to the west. But now he had to cover that mile.\n\nThe wolverines? Thorvald? There was one lure which might draw the\nanimals on to the rendezvous. Taggi had brought down a \"deer\" just\nbefore they had left the raft. And instead of allowing both beasts to\nfeast at leisure, Shann had lashed the carcass to the shaky platform of\nwood and brush, putting it out to swing in the current, though still\nmoored to the bank.\n\nWolverines always cached that part of the kill which they did not\nconsume at the first eating, usually burying it. He had hoped that to\nleave the carcass in such a way would draw both animals back to the raft\nwhen they were hungry. And they had not fed particularly well that day.\n\nThorvald? Well, the Survey officer had made it very plain during the\npast five days of what Shann had come to look upon as an uneasy\npartnership that he considered himself far abler to manage in the field,\nwhile he had grave doubts of Shann's efficiency in the direction of\nsurvival potential.\n\nThe Terran started along the pattern of retreat he had laid out to the\nriver bed. His heart pounded as he ran, not because of the physical\neffort he was expending, but because again from the camp had come that\nblood-freezing howl. A lighter line marked the lip of the cut in which\nthe stream was set, something he had not foreseen. He threw himself down\nto crawl the last few feet, hugging the earth.\n\nThat very pale luminescence was easily accounted for by what lay below.\nShann licked his lips and tasted the sting of sap smeared on his face\nduring his struggle with the bushes. While the strip of meadow behind\nhim now had been spotted with light plants, the cut below showed an\nalmost solid line of them stringing willow-wise along the water's edge.\nTo go down at this point was simply to spotlight his presence for any\nThrog on his trail. He could only continue along the upper bank, hoping\nto finally find an end to the growth of luminescent vegetation below.\n\nShann was perhaps five yards from the point where he had come to the\nriver, when a commotion behind made him freeze and turn his head\ncautiously. The camp was half hidden, and the fires there must be dying.\nBut a twisting, struggling mass was rolling across the meadow in his\ngeneral direction.\n\nThorvald fighting off an attack? The wolverines? Shann drew his legs\nunder him, ready to erupt into a counter-offensive. He hesitated\nbetween drawing stunner or knife. In his brush with the injured Throg at\nthe wreck the stunner had had little impression on the enemy. And now he\nwondered if his blade, though it was super-steel at its toughest, could\npierce any joint in the armored bodies of the aliens.\n\nThere was surely a fight in progress. The whole crazily weaving blot\ncollapsed and rolled down upon three bright light plants. Dull sheen of\nThrog casing was revealed ... no sign of fur, or flesh, or clothing. Two\nof the aliens battling? But why?\n\nOne of those figures got up stiffly, bent over the huddle still on the\nground, and pulled at something. The wooden shaft of Shann's spear was\nwanly visible. And the form on the ground did not stir as that was\njerked loose. The Throg leader dead? Shann hoped so. He slid his knife\nback into the sheath, tapped the hilt to make sure it was firmly in\nplace, and crawled on. The river, twisting here and there, was a\npromising pool of dusky shadow ahead. The bank of willow-things was\ncoming to an end, and none too soon. For when he glanced back again he\nsaw another Throg run across the meadow, and he watched them lift their\nfellow, carrying him back to camp.\n\nThe Throgs might seem indestructible, but he had put an end to one,\naided by luck and a very rough weapon. With that to bolster his\nself-confidence to a higher notch, Shann dropped by cautious degrees\nover the bank and down to the water's edge. When his boots splashed into\nthe oily flood he began to tramp downstream, feeling the pull of the\nwater, first ankle high and then about his calves. This early in the\nseason they did hot have to fear floods, and hereabouts the stream was\nwide and shallow, save in mid-current at the center point.\n\nTwice more he had to skirt patches of light plants, and once a young\ntree stood bathed in radiance with a pinkish tinge instead of the usual\nghostly gray. Within the haze which tented the drooping branches,\nflitted small glittering, flying things; and the scent of its half-open\nbuds was heavy on the air, neither pleasant nor unpleasant in Shann's\nnostrils, merely different.\n\nHe dared to whistle, a soft call he hoped would carry along the cut\nbetween the high banks. But, though he paused and listened until it\nseemed that every cell in his thin body was occupied in that act, he\nheard no answering call from the wolverines, nor any suggestion that\neither the animals or Thorvald were headed in the direction of the raft.\n\nWhat was he going to do if none of the others joined him downstream?\nThorvald had said not to linger there past daylight. Yet Shann knew that\nunless he actually sighted a Throg patrol splashing after him he would\nwait until he made sure of the others' fate. Both Taggi and Togi were as\nimportant to him as the Survey officer. Perhaps more so, he told himself\nnow, because he understood them to a certain degree and found\ncompanionship in their undemanding company which he could not claim from\nthe man.\n\nWhy _did_ Thorvald insist upon their going on to the seashore? To\nShann's mind his own first plan of holing up back in the eastern\nmountains was better. Those heights had as many hiding places as the\nfiord country. But Thorvald had suddenly become so set on this westward\ntrek that he had given in. As much as he inwardly rebelled when he took\nthem, he found himself obeying the older man's orders. It was only when\nhe was alone, as now, that he began to question both Thorvald's motives\nand his authority.\n\nThree sprigs of a light bush set in a triangle. Shann paused and then\nclimbed out on the bank, shaking the water from his boots as Taggi might\nshake such drops from a furred limb. This was the sign they had set to\nmark their rendezvous point, but....\n\nShann whirled, drawing his stunner. The raft was a dark blob on the\nsurface of the water some feet farther on. And now it was bobbing up and\ndown violently. That was not the result of any normal tug of current. He\nheard an indignant squeal and relaxed with a little laugh. He need not\nhave worried about the wolverines; that bait had drawn them all right.\nBoth of them were now engaged in eating, though they had to conduct\ntheir feast on the rather shaky foundation of the makeshift transport.\n\nThey paid no attention as he waded out, pulling at the anchor cord as he\nwent. The wind must have carried his familiar scent to them. As the\nwater climbed to his shoulders Shann put one hand on the outmost log of\nthe raft. One of the animals snarled a warning at being disturbed. Or\nhad that been at him?\n\nShann stood where he was, listening intently. Yes, there was a splashing\nsound from upstream. Whoever followed his own recent trail was taking no\ncare to keep that pursuit a secret, and the pace of the newcomer was\nfast enough to spell trouble.\n\nThrogs? Tensely the Terran waited for some reaction from the wolverines.\nHe was sure that if the aliens had followed him, both animals would give\nwarning. Save when they had gone wild upon hearing that strange wail\nfrom the camp, they avoided meeting the enemy.\n\nBut from all sounds the animals had not stopped feeding. So the other\nwas no beetle-head. On the other hand, why would Thorvald so advertise\nhis coming, unless the need for speed was greater than caution? Shann\ndrew taut the mooring cord, bringing out his knife to saw through that\ntough length. A figure passed the three-sprig signal, ran onto the raft.\n\n\"Lantee?\" The call came in a hoarse, demanding whisper.\n\n\"Here.\"\n\n\"Cut loose. We have to get out of here!\"\n\nThorvald flung himself forward, and together the men scrambled up on the\nraft. The mangled carcass plunged into the water, dislodged by their\nefforts. But before the wolverines could follow it, the mooring vine\nsnapped, and the river current took them. Feeling the raft sway and\nbegin to spin, the wolverines whined, crouched in the middle of what now\nseemed a very frail craft.\n\nBehind them, far away but too clear, sounded that eerie howling, topping\nthe sigh of the night wind.\n\n\"I saw----\" Thorvald gasped, pausing as if to catch full lungfuls of air\nto back his words, \"they have a 'hound!' That's what you hear.\"\n\n\n\n\n5. PURSUIT\n\n\nAs the raft revolved slowly it also slipped downstream at a steadily\nincreasing pace, for the current had them in hold. The wolverines\npressed close to Shann until the musky scent of their fur, their animal\nwarmth, enveloped him. One growled deep in its throat, perhaps in answer\nto that wind-borne wail.\n\n\"Hound?\" Shann asked.\n\nBeside him in the dark Thorvald was working loose one of the poles they\nhad readied to help control the raft's voyaging. The current carried\nthem along, but there was a need for those lengths of sapling to fend\nthem free from rocks and water-buried snags.\n\n\"What hound?\" the younger man demanded more sharply when there came no\nimmediate answer.\n\n\"The Throgs' tracker. But why did they import one?\" Thorvald's\npuzzlement was plain in his tone. He added a moment later, with some of\nhis usual firmness, \"We may be in for bad trouble now. Use of a hound\nmeans an attempt to take prisoners----\"\n\n\"Then they do not know that we are here, as Terrans, I mean?\"\n\nThorvald seemed to be sorting out his thoughts when he replied to that.\n\"They could have brought a hound here just on chance that they might\nmiss one of us in the initial mop-up. Or, if they believe we are\nnatives, they could want a specimen for study.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't they just blast down Terrans on sight?\"\n\nShann saw the dark blot which was Thorvald's head shake in negation.\n\n\"They might need a live Terran--badly and soon.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"To operate the camp call beam.\"\n\nShann's momentary bewilderment vanished. He knew enough of Survey\nprocedure to guess the reason for such a move on the part of the aliens.\n\n\"The settler transport?\"\n\n\"Yes, the ship. She won't planet here without the proper signal. And the\nThrogs can't give that. If they don't take her, their time's run out\nbefore they have even made a start here.\"\n\n\"But how could they know that the transport is nearly due? When we\nintercept their calls they're pure gibberish to us. Can they read our\ncodes?\"\n\n\"The supposition is that they can't. Only, concerning Throgs, all we\nknow is supposition. Anyway, they do know the routine for establishing a\nTerran colony, and we can't alter that procedure except in small\nnonessentials,\" Thorvald said grimly. \"If that transport doesn't pick up\nthe proper signal to set down here on schedule, her captain will call in\nthe patrol escort ... then exit one Throg base. But if the beetle-heads\ncan trick the ship in and take her, then they'll have a clear five or\nsix more months here to consolidate their own position. After that it\nwould take more than just one patrol cruiser to clear Warlock; it will\nrequire a fleet. So the Throgs will have another world to play with, and\nan important one. This lies on a direct line between the Odin and\nKulkulkan systems. A Throg base on such a trade route could eventually\ncut us right out of this quarter of the galaxy.\"\n\n\"So you think they want to capture us in order to bring the transport\nin?\"\n\n\"By our type of reasoning, that would be a logical move--_if_ they know\nwe are here. They haven't too many of those hounds, and they don't risk\nthem on petty jobs. I'd hoped we'd covered our trail well. But we had to\nrisk that attack on the camp.... I needed the map case!\" Again Thorvald\nmight have been talking to himself. \"Time ... and the right maps--\" he\nbrought his fist down on the raft, making the platform tremble--\"that's\nwhat I have to have now.\"\n\nAnother patch of light-willows stretched along the river-banks, and as\nthey sailed through that ribbon of ghostly radiance they could see each\nother's faces. Thorvald's was bleak, hard, his eyes on the stream behind\nthem as if he expected at any moment to see a Throg emerge from the\nsurface of the water.\n\n\"Suppose that thing--\" Shann pointed upstream with his chin--\"follows\nus? What is it anyway?\" Hound suggested Terran dog, but he couldn't\nstretch his imagination to believe in a working co-operation between\nThrog and any mammal.\n\n\"A rather spectacular combination of toad and lizard, with a few other\ngrisly touches, is about as close as you can get to a general\ndescription. And that won't be too accurate, because like the Throgs its\nremote ancestors must have been of the insect family. If the thing\nfollows us, and I think we can be sure that it will, we'll have to take\nsteps. There is always this advantage--those hounds cannot be controlled\nfrom a flyer, and the beetle-heads never take kindly to foot slogging.\nSo we won't have to expect any speedy chase. If it slips its masters in\nrough country, we can try to ambush it.\" In the dim light Thorvald was\nfrowning. \"I flew over the territory ahead on two sweeps, and it is a\nqueer mixture. If we can reach the rough country bordering the sea,\nwe'll have won the first round. I don't believe that the Throgs will be\nin a hurry to track us in there. They'll try two alternatives to chasing\nus on foot. One, use their energy beams to rake any suspect valley, and\nsince there are hundreds of valleys all pretty much alike, that will\ntake some time. Or they can attempt to shake us out with a dumdum should\nthey have one here, which I doubt.\"\n\nShann tensed. The stories of the effects of the Throg's dumdum weapon\nwere anything but pretty.\n\n\"And to get a dumdum,\" Thorvald continued as if he were discussing a\npurely theoretical matter and not a threat of something worse than\ndeath, \"They'll have to bring in one of their major ships. Which they\nwill hesitate to do with a cruiser near at hand. Our own danger spot now\nis the section we should strike soon after dawn tomorrow if the rate of\nthis current is what I have timed it. There is a band of desert on this\nside of the mountains. The river gorge deepens there and the land is\nbare. Let them send a ship over and we could be as visible as if we were\nsending up flares----\"\n\n\"How about taking cover now and going on only at night?\" suggested\nShann.\n\n\"Ordinarily, I'd say yes. But with time pressing us now, no. If we keep\nstraight on, we could reach the foothills in about forty hours, maybe\nless. And we have to stay with the river. To strike across country there\nwithout good supplies and on foot is sheer folly.\"\n\nTwo days. With perhaps the Throgs unleashing their hound on land,\ncombing from their flyers. With a desert.... Shann put out his hands to\nthe wolverines. The prospect certainly didn't seem anywhere near as\nsimple as it had the night before when Thorvald had planned this escape.\nBut then the Survey officer had left out quite a few points which were\nnot pertinent. Was he also leaving out other essentials? Shann wanted to\nask, but somehow he could not.\n\nAfter a while he dozed, his head resting on his knees. He awoke, roused\nout of a vivid dream, a dream so detailed and so deeply impressed in a\npicture on his mind that he was confused when he blinked at the\nriverbank visible in the half-light of early dawn.\n\nInstead of that stretch of earth and ragged vegetation now gliding past\nhim as the raft angled along, he should have been fronting a vast skull\nstark against the sky--a skull whose outlines were oddly inhuman, from\nwhose eyeholes issued and returned flying things while its sharply\nprotruding lower jaw was lapped by water. In color that skull had been a\nviolent clash of blood-red and purple. Shann blinked again at the\nriverbank, seeing transposed on it still that ghostly haze of bone-bare\ndome, cavernous eyeholes and nose slit, fanged jaws. That skull was a\nmountain, or a mountain was a skull--and it was important to him; he\nmust locate it!\n\nHe moved stiffly, his legs and arms cramped but not cold. The wolverines\nstirred on either side of him. Thorvald continued to sleep, curled up\nbeyond, the pole still clasped in his hands. A flat map case was slung\nby a strap about his neck, its thin envelope between his arm and his\nbody as if for safekeeping. On the smooth flap was the Survey seal, and\nit was fastened with a finger lock.\n\nThorvald had lost some of the bright hard surface he had shown at the\nspaceport where Shann had first sighted him. There were hollows in his\ncheeks, sending into high relief those bone ridges beneath his eye\nsockets, giving him a faint resemblance to the skull of Shann's dream.\nHis face was grimed, his field uniform stained and torn. Only his hair\nwas as bright as ever.\n\nShann smeared the back of his hand across his own face, not doubting\nthat he must present an even more disreputable appearance. He leaned\nforward cautiously to look into the water, but that surface was not\nquiet enough to act as a mirror.\n\nGetting to his feet as the raft bobbed under his shift of weight, Shann\nstudied the territory now about them. He could not match Thorvald's\ninches, just as he must have a third less bulk than the officer, but\nstanding, he could sight something of what now lay beyond the rising\nbanks of the cut. That grass which had been so thick in the meadowlands\naround the camp had thinned into separate clumps, pale lavender in\ncolor. And the scrawniness of stem and blade suggested dehydration and\npoor soil. The earth showing between those clumps was not of the usual\nblue, but pallid, too, bleached to gray, while the bushes along the\nstream's edge were few and smaller. They must have crossed the line into\nthe desert Thorvald had promised.\n\nShann edged around to face west. There was light enough in the sky to\nsight tall black pyramids waiting. They had to reach those distant\nmountains, mountains whose feet on the other side were resting in sea\nwater. He studied them carefully, surveying each peak he could separate\nfrom its fellows.\n\nDid the skull lie among them? The conviction that the place he had seen\nin his dream was real, that it was to be found on Warlock, persisted.\nNot only was it a definite feature of the landscape somewhere in the\nwild places of this world, but it was also necessary for him to locate\nit. Why? Shann puzzled over that, with a growing uneasiness which was\nnot quite fear, not yet, anyway.\n\nThorvald moved. The raft tilted and the wolverines became growly. Shann\nsat down, one hand out to the officer's shoulder in warning. Feeling\nthat touch Thorvald shifted, one hand striking out blindly in a blow\nwhich Shann was just able to avoid while with the other he pinned the\nmap case yet tighter to him.\n\n\"Take it easy!\" Shann urged.\n\nThe other's eyelids flicked. He looked up, but not as if he saw Shann at\nall.\n\n\"The Cavern of the Veil----\" he muttered. \"Utgard....\" Then his eyes did\nfocus and he sat up, gazing around him with a frown.\n\n\"We're in the desert,\" Shann announced.\n\nThorvald got up, balancing on feet planted a little apart, looking to\nthe faded expanse of the waste spreading from the river cut. He stared\nat the mountains before he squatted down to fumble with the lock of the\nmap case.\n\nThe wolverines were growing restless, though they still did not try to\nmove about too freely on the raft, greeting Shann with vocal complaint.\nHe and Thorvald could satisfy their hunger with a handful of\nconcentrates from the survival kit. But those dry tablets could not\nserve the animals. Shann studied the terrain with more knowledge than he\nhad possessed a week earlier. This was not hunting land, but there\nremained the bounty of the river.\n\n\"We'll have to feed Taggi and Togi,\" he broke the silence abruptly. \"If\nwe don't, they'll be into the river and off on their own.\"\n\nThorvald glanced up from one of the tough, thin sheets of map skin,\nagain as if he had been drawn back from some distance. His eyes moved\nfrom Shann to the unpromising shore.\n\n\"How? With what?\" he wanted to know. Then the real urgency of the\nsituation must have penetrated his mental isolation. \"You have an\nidea--?\"\n\n\"There's those fish we found them eating back by the mountain stream,\"\nShann said, recalling an incident of a few days earlier. \"Rocks here,\ntoo, like those the fish were hiding under. Maybe we can locate some of\nthem here.\"\n\nHe knew that Thorvald would be reluctant to work the raft in shore, to\nspare time for such hunting. But there would be no arguing with hungry\nwolverines, and he did not propose to lose the animals for the officer's\nwhim.\n\nHowever, Thorvald did not protest. They poled the raft out of the main\npull of the current, sending it in toward the southern shore in the lee\nof a clump of light-willows. Shann scrambled ashore, the wolverines\nafter him, sniffling along at his heels while he overturned likely\nlooking rocks to unroof some odd underwater dwellings. The fish with the\nrudimentary legs were present and not agile enough even in their native\nelement to avoid well-clawed paws which scooped them neatly out of the\nriver shallows. There was also a sleek furred creature with a broad flat\nhead and paddle-equipped forepaws, rather like a miniature seal, which\nTaggi appropriated before Shann had a chance to examine it closely. In\nfact, the wolverines wrought havoc along a half-mile section of bank\nbefore the Terran could coax them back to the raft.\n\nAs they hunted, Shann got a better idea of the land about the river. It\nwas sere, the vegetation dwindling except for some rough spikes of\nthings pushing through the parched ground like flayed fingers, their\npuffed redness in contrast to the usual amethystine coloring of\nWarlock's growing things. Under the climbing sun that whole stretch of\ncountry was revealed in a stark bareness which at first repelled, and\nthen began to interest him.\n\nHe discovered Thorvald standing on the upper bluff, looking out toward\nthe waiting mountains. The officer turned as Shann urged the wolverines\nto the raft, and when he jumped down the drop to join them, Shann saw he\ncarried a map strip unrolled in his hand.\n\n\"The situation is not as good as we hoped,\" he told the younger man.\n\"Well have to leave the river to cross the heights.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"There're rapids--bending in a falls.\" The officer squatted down,\nspreading out the strip and making stabs at it with a nervous finger\ntip. \"Here we have to leave. This is all rough ground. But lying to the\nsouth there's a gap which may be a pass. This was made from an aerial\nsurvey.\"\n\nShann knew enough to realize to what extent such a guide could go wrong.\nMain features of the landscape would be clear enough from aloft, but\nthere might be unsurmountable difficulties at ground level which were\nnot distinguishable from the air. Yet Thorvald had planned this journey\nas if he had already explored their escape route and that it was as open\nand easy as a stroll down Tyr's main transport way. Why was it so\nnecessary that they try to reach the sea? However, since he had no\nobjection to voice except a dislike for indefinite information, Shann\ndid not question the other's calm assumption of command, not yet,\nanyway.\n\nAs they embarked and worked back into the current, Shann studied his\ncompanion. Thorvald had freely listed the difficulties lying before\nthem. Yet he did not seem in the least worried about their being able to\nwin through to the sea--or if he was, his outer shell of unconcern\nremained uncracked. Before their first day together had ended, the\nyounger Terran had learned that to Thorvald he was only another tool, to\nbe used by the Survey officer in some project which the other believed\nof primary importance. And his resentment of the valuation was under\ncontrol so far. He valued Thorvald's knowledge, but the other's attitude\nchilled and rebuffed his need for something more than a half partnership\nof work.\n\nWhy had Thorvald come back to Warlock in the first place? And why had it\nbeen necessary for him to risk his life--perhaps more than his life if\ntheir theory was correct concerning the Throgs' wish to capture a\nTerran--to get that set of maps from the plundered camp? When he had\nfirst talked of that raid, his promised loot had been supplies to fill\ntheir daily needs; there had been no mention of maps. By all signs\nThorvald was engaged on some mission. And what would happen if he,\nShann, suddenly stopped being the other's obedient underling and\ndemanded a few explanations here and now?\n\nOnly Shann knew enough about men to also know that he would not get any\ninformation out of Thorvald that the latter was not ready to give, and\nthat such a showdown, coming prematurely, would only end in his own\ndiscomfiture. He smiled wryly now, remembering his emotions when he had\nfirst seen Ragnar Thorvald months ago. As if the officer ever considered\nthe likes, dislikes--or dreams--of one Shann Lantee. No, reality and\ndreams seldom approached each other. Dreams....\n\n\"On any of those shoreline maps,\" he asked suddenly, \"do they have\nmarked a mountain shaped like a skull?\"\n\nThorvald thrust with his pole. \"Skull?\" he repeated, a little absently,\nas he so often did in answer to Shann's questions unless they dealt with\nsome currently important matter.\n\n\"A queer sort of skull,\" Shann said. Just as vividly as when he had\nfirst awakened, he could picture that skull mountain with the flying\nthings about its eye sockets. And that, too, was odd; dream impressions\nusually faded with the passing of waking hours. \"It has a protruding\nlower jaw and the waves wash that ... red-and-purple rock----\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nHe had Thorvald's complete attention now.\n\n\"Where did you hear about it?\" That demand followed quickly.\n\n\"I didn't hear about it. I dreamed of it last night. I stood there right\nin front of it. There were birds--or things flying like birds--going in\nand out of the eyeholes----\"\n\n\"What else?\" Thorvald leaned across his pole, his eyes alive, avid, as\nif he would pull the reply he wanted out of Shann by force.\n\n\"That was all I remember--the skull mountain.\" He did not add his other\nimpression, that he was meant to find that skull, that he _must_ find\nit.\n\n\"Nothing....\" Thorvald paused, and then spoke slowly, with a visible\nreluctance. \"Nothing else? No cavern with a green veil--a wide green\nveil--strung across it?\"\n\nShann shook his head. \"Just the skull mountain.\"\n\nThorvald looked as if he didn't quite believe that, but Shann's\nexpression must have been convincing, for he laughed shortly.\n\n\"Well, there goes one nice neat theory up in smoke!\" he commented. \"No,\nyour skull doesn't appear on any of our maps, and so probably my cavern\ndoes not exist either. They may both be smoke screens----\"\n\n\"What--?\" But Shann never finished that query.\n\nA wind was rising in the desert to blow across the slit which held the\nriver, carrying with it a fine shifting of sand which coasted down into\nthe water as a gray haze, coating men, animals, and raft, and sighing as\nsnow sighs when it falls.\n\nOnly that did not drown out another cry, a thin cry, diluted by the\nmiles of land stretching behind them, but yet carrying that long\nululating howl they had heard in the Throg camp. Thorvald grinned\nmirthlessly.\n\n\"The hound's on trail.\"\n\nHe bent to the pole, using it to aid the pace of the current. Shann,\nchilled in spite of the sun's heat, followed his example, wondering if\ntime had ceased to fight on their side.\n\n\n\n\n6. THE HOUND\n\n\nThe sun was a harsh ball of heat baking the ground and then, in some odd\nmanner, drawing back that same fieriness. In the coolness of the eastern\nmountains Shann would not have believed that Warlock could hold such\nheat. The men discarded their jackets early as they swung to dip the\npoles. But they dared not strip off the rest of their clothing lest\ntheir skin burn. And again gusts of wind now drove sand over the edge of\nthe cut to blanket the water.\n\nShann wiped his eyes, pausing in his eternal push-push, to look at the\nrocks which they were passing in threatening proximity. For the slash\nwhich held the river had narrowed. And the rock of its walls was naked\nof earth, save for sheltered pockets holding the drift of sand dust,\nwhile boulders of all sizes cut into the path of the flowing water.\n\nHe had not been mistaken; they were going faster, faster even than their\nefforts with the poles would account for. With the narrowing of the bed\nof the stream, the current was taking on a new swiftness. Shann said as\nmuch and Thorvald nodded.\n\n\"We're approaching the first of the rapids.\"\n\n\"Where we get off and walk around,\" Shann croaked wearily. The dust\ngritted between his teeth, irritated his eyes. \"Do we stay beside the\nriver?\"\n\n\"As long as we can,\" Thorvald replied somberly. \"We have no way of\ntransporting water.\"\n\nYes, a man could live on very slim rations of food, continue to beat his\nway over a bad trail if he had the concentrate tablets they carried. But\nthere was no going without water, and in this heat such an effort would\nfinish them quickly. Always they both listened for another cry from\nbehind, a cry to tell them just how near the Throg hunting party had\ncome.\n\n\"No Throg flyers yet,\" Shann observed. He had expected one of those\nblack plates to come cruising the moment the hound had pointed the\ndirection for their pursuers.\n\n\"Not in a storm such as this.\" Thorvald, without releasing his hold on\nthe raft pole, pointed with his chin to the swirling haze cloaking the\nair above the cut walls. Here the river dug yet deeper into the\nbeginning of a canyon. They could breathe better. The dust still sifted\ndown but not as thickly as a half hour earlier. Though over their heads\nthe sky was now a grayish lid, shutting out the sun, bringing a portion\nof coolness to the travelers.\n\nThe Survey officer glanced from side to side, watching the banks as if\nhunting for some special mark or sign. At last he used his pole as a\npointer to indicate a rough pile of boulders ahead. Some former\nlandslide had quarter dammed the river at that point, and the drift of\nseasonal floods was caught in and among the rocky pile to form a prickly\npeninsula.\n\n\"In there----\"\n\nThey brought the raft to shore, fighting the faster current. The\nwolverines, who had been subdued by the heat and the dust, flung\nthemselves to the rocks with the eagerness of passengers deserting a\nsinking ship for certain rescue. Thorvald settled the map case more\nsecurely between his arm and side before he took the same leap. When\nthey were all ashore he prodded the raft out into the stream again,\npushing the platform along until it was sucked by the current past the\nline of boulders.\n\n\"Listen!\"\n\nBut Shann had already caught that distant rumble of sound. It was\nsteady, beating like some giant drum. Certainly it did not herald a\nThrog ship in flight and it came from ahead, not from their back trail.\n\n\"Rapids ... perhaps even the falls,\" Thorvald interpreted that faint\nthunder. \"Now, let's see what kind of a road we can find here.\"\n\nThe tongue of boulders, spiked with driftwood, was firmly based against\nthe wall of the cut. But it sloped up to within a few feet of the top of\nthat gap, more than one landslide having contributed to its fashioning.\nThe landing stage paralleled the river for perhaps some fifty feet.\nBeyond it water splashed a straight wall. They would have to climb and\nfollow the stream along the top of the embankment, maybe being forced\nwell away from the source of the water.\n\nBy unspoken consent they both knelt and drank deeply from their cupped\nhands, splashing more of the liquid over their heads, washing the dust\nfrom their skins. Then they began to climb the rough assent up which the\nwolverines had already vanished. The murk above them was less solid, but\nagain the fine grit streaked their faces, embedding itself in their\nhair.\n\nShann paused to scrape a film of mud from his lips and chin. Then he\nmade the last pull, bracing his slight body against the push of the wind\nhe met there. A palm struck hard between his shoulders, nearly sending\nhim sprawling. He had only wits enough left to recognize that as an\norder to get on, and he staggered ahead until rock arched over him and\nthe sand drift was shut off.\n\nHis shoulder met solid stone, and having rubbed the sand from his eyes,\nShann realized he was in a pocket in the cliff walls. Well overhead he\ncaught a glimpse of natural amber sky through a slit, but here was a\ntwilight which thickened into complete darkness.\n\nThere was no sign of wolverines. Thorvald moved along the pocket\nsouthward, and Shann followed him. Once more they faced a dead end. For\nthe crevice, with the sheer descent to the river on the right, the cliff\nwall at its back, came to an abrupt stop in a drop which caught at\nShann's stomach when he ventured to look down.\n\nIf some battleship of the interstellar fleet had aimed a force beam\nacross the mountains of Warlock, cutting down to what lay under the\nfirst envelope of planet-skin, perhaps the resulting wound might have\nresembled that slash. What had caused such a break between the height on\nwhich they stood and the much taller peak beyond, Shann could not guess.\nBut it must have been a cataclysm of spectacular dimensions. There was\ncertainly no descending to the bottom of that cut and reclimbing the\nrock face on the other side. The fugitives would either have to return\nto the river with all its ominous warnings of trouble to come, or find\nsome other path across that gap which now provided such an effective\nbarrier to the west.\n\n\"Down!\" Just as Thorvald had pushed him out of the murk of the dust\nstorm into the crevice, so now did that officer jerk Shann from his\nfeet, forcing him to the floor of the half cave from which they had\npartially emerged.\n\nA shadow moved across the bright band of sunlit sky.\n\n\"Back!\" Thorvald caught at Shann again, his greater strength prevailing\nas he literally dragged the younger man into the dusk of the crevice.\nAnd he did not pause, nor allow Shann to do so, even when they were well\nundercover again. At last they reached the dark hole in the southern\nwall which they had passed earlier. And a push from Thorvald sent his\ncompanion into that.\n\nThen a blow greater than any the Survey officer had aimed at him struck\nShann. He was hurled against a rough wall with impetus enough to explode\nthe air from his lungs, the ensuing pain so great that he feared his\nribs had given under that thrust. Before his eyes fire lashed down the\nslit, searing him into temporary blindness. That flash was the last\nthing he remembered as thick darkness closed in, shutting him into the\nnothingness of unconsciousness.\n\nIt hurt to breathe; he was slowly aware first of that pain and then the\nfact that he _was_ breathing, that he had to endure the pain for the\nsake of breath. His whole body was jarred into a dull torment as a\nweight pressed upon his twisted legs. Then strong animal breath puffed\ninto his face. Shann lifted one hand by will power, touched thick fur,\nfelt the rasp of a tongue laid wetly across his fingers.\n\nSomething close to terror engulfed him for a second or two when he knew\nthat he could not see! The black about him was colored by jagged flashes\nof red which he somehow guessed were actually inside his eyes. He groped\nthrough that fire-pierced darkness. An animal whimper from the throat of\nthe shaggy body pressed against him; he answered that movement.\n\n\"Taggi?\"\n\nThe shove against him was almost enough to pin him once more to the\nwall, a painful crush on his aching ribs, as the wolverine responded to\nhis name. That second nudge from the other side must be Togi's bid for\nattention.\n\nBut what had happened? Thorvald had hurled him back just after that\nshadow had swung over the ledge. That shadow! Shann's wits quickened as\nhe tried to make sense of what he could remember. A Throg ship! Then\nthat fiery lash which had cut after them could only have resulted from\none of those energy bolts such as had wiped out the others of his kind\nat the camp. But he was still alive----!\n\n\"Thorvald?\" He called through his personal darkness. When there was no\nanswer, Shann called again, more urgently. Then he hunched forward on\nhis hands and knees, pushing Taggi gently aside, running his hands over\nprojecting rocks, uneven flooring.\n\nHis fingers touched what could only be cloth, before they met the warmth\nof flesh. And he half threw himself against the supine body of the\nSurvey officer, groping awkwardly for heartbeat, for some sign that the\nother was still living.\n\n\"What----?\" The one word came thickly, but Shann gave something close to a\nsob of relief as he caught the faint mutter. He squatted back on his\nheels, pressed his forearm against his aching eyes in a kind of fierce\nwill to see.\n\nPerhaps that pressure did relieve some of the blackout, for when he\nblinked again, the complete dark and the fiery trails had faded to gray,\nand he was sure he saw dimly a source of light to his left.\n\nThe Throg ship had fired upon them. But the aliens could not have used\nthe full force of their weapon or neither of the Terrans would still be\nalive. Which meant, Shann's thoughts began to make sense--sense which\nbrought apprehension--the Throgs probably intended to disable rather\nthan kill. They wanted prisoners, just as Thorvald had warned.\n\nHow long did the Terrans have before the aliens would come to collect\nthem? There was no fit landing place hereabouts for their flyer. The\nbeetle-heads would have to set down at the edge of the desert land and\nclimb the mountains on foot. And the Throgs were not good at that. So,\nthe fugitives still had a measure of time.\n\nTime to do what? The country itself held them securely captive. That\ndrop to the southwest was one barrier. To retreat eastward would mean\nrunning straight into the hands of the hunters. To descend again to the\nriver, their raft gone, was worse than useless. There was only this side\npocket in which they sheltered. And once the Throgs arrived, they could\nscoop the Terrans out at their leisure, perhaps while stunned by a\ncontrolling energy beam.\n\n\"Taggi? Togi?\" Shann was suddenly aware that he had not heard the\nwolverines for some time.\n\nHe was answered by a weirdly muffled call--from the south! Had the\nanimals found a new exit? Was this niche more than just a niche? A cave\nof some length, or even a passage running back into the interior of the\npeaks? With that faint hope spurring him, Shann bent again over\nThorvald, able now to make out the other's huddled form. Then he drew\nthe torch from the inner loop of his coat and pressed the lowest stud.\n\nHis eyes smarted in answer to that light, watered until tears patterned\nthe grime and dust on his cheeks. But he could make out what lay before\nthem, a hole leading into the cliff face, the hole which might furnish\nthe door to escape.\n\nThe Survey officer moved, levering himself up, his eyes screwed tightly\nshut.\n\n\"Lantee?\"\n\n\"Here. And there's a tunnel--right behind you. The wolverines went that\nway....\"\n\nTo his surprise there was a thin ghost of a smile on Thorvald's usually\nstraight-lipped mouth. \"And we'd better be away before visitors arrive?\"\n\nSo he, too, must have thought his way through the sequence of past\naction to the same conclusion concerning the Throg movements.\n\n\"Can you see, Lantee?\" The question was painfully casual, but a note in\nit, almost a reaching for reassurance, cut for the first time through\nthe wall which had stood between them from their chance meeting by the\nwrecked ship.\n\n\"Better now. I couldn't when I first came to,\" Shann answered quickly.\n\nThorvald opened his eyes, but Shann guessed that he was as blind as he\nhimself had been, He caught at the officer's nearer hand, drawing it to\nrest on his own belt.\n\n\"Grab hold!\" Shann was giving the orders now. \"By the look of that\nopening we had better try crawling. I've a torch on at low----\"\n\n\"Good enough.\" The other's fingers fumbled on the band about Shann's\nslim waist until they gripped tight at his back. He started on into the\nopening, drawing Thorvald by that hold with him.\n\nLuckily, they did not have to crawl far, for shortly past the entrance\nthe fault or vein they were following became a passage high enough for\neven the tall Thorvald to travel without stooping. And then only a\nlittle later he released his hold on Shann, reporting he could now see\nwell enough to manage on his own.\n\nThe torch beam caught on a wall and awoke from there a glitter which\nhurt their eyes--a green-gold cluster of crystals. Several feet on,\nthere was another flash of embedded crystals. Those might promise\npriceless wealth, but neither Terran paused to examine them more closely\nor touch their surfaces. From time to time Shann whistled. And always he\nwas answered by the wolverines, their calls coming from ahead. So the\nmen continued to hope that they were not walking into a trap from which\nthe Throgs could extract them.\n\n\"Snap off your torch a moment!\" Thorvald ordered.\n\nShann obeyed. The subdued light vanished. Yet there was still light to\nbe seen--ahead and above.\n\n\"Front door,\" Thorvald observed. \"How do we get up?\"\n\nThe torch showed them that, a narrow ladder of ledges branching off when\nthe passage they followed took a turn to the left and east. Afterward\nShann remembered that climb with wonder that they had actually made it,\nthough their advance had been slow, passing the torch from one to\nanother to make sure of their footing.\n\nShann was top man when a last spurt of effort enabled him to draw\nhimself out into the open, his hands raw, his nails broken and torn. He\nsat there, stupefied with his own weariness, to stare about.\n\nThorvald called impatiently, and Shann reached for the torch to hold it\nfor the officer. Then Thorvald crawled out; he, too, looked around in\ndull surprise.\n\nOn either side, peaks cut high into the amber of the sky. But this bowl\nin which the men had found refuge was rich in growing things. Though the\ntrees were stunted, the grass grew almost as high here as it did on the\nmeadows of the lowlands. Quartering the pocket valley, galloped the\nwolverines, expressing in that wild activity their delight in this\nfreedom.\n\n\"Good campsite.\"\n\nThorvald shook his head. \"We can't stay here.\"\n\nAnd, to underline that gloomy prophesy, there issued from that hole\nthrough which they had just come, muffled and broken, but still\nthreatening, the howl of the Throgs' hound.\n\nThe Survey officer caught the torch from Shann's hold and knelt to flash\nit into the interior of the passage. As the beam slowly circled that\nopening, he held out his other arm, measuring the size of the aperture.\n\n\"When that thing gets on a hot scent\"--he snapped off the beam--\"the\nbeetle-heads won't be able to control it. There will be no reason for\nthem to attempt to. Those hounds obey their first orders: kill--or\ncapture. And I think this one operates on 'capture.' So they'll loose it\nto run ahead of their party.\"\n\n\"And we move to knock it out?\" Shann relied now on the other's\nexperience.\n\nThorvald rose. \"It would need a blaster on full power to finish off a\nhound. No, we can't kill it. But we can make it a doorkeeper to our\nadvantage.\" He trotted down into the valley, Shann beside him without\nunderstanding in the least, but aware that Thorvald did have some plan.\nThe officer bent, searched the ground, and began to pull from under the\nloose surface dirt one of those nets of tough vines which they had used\nfor cords. He thrust a double handful of this hasty harvest into Shann's\nhold with a single curt order: \"Twist these together and make as thick a\nrope as you can!\"\n\nShann twisted, discovering to his pleased surprise that under pressure\nthe vines exuded a sticky purple sap which not only coated his hands,\nbut also acted as an adhesive for the vines themselves so that his task\nwas not nearly as formidable as it had first seemed. With his force ax\nThorvald cut down two of the stunted trees and stripped them of\nbranches, wedging the poles into the rocks about the entrance of the\nhole.\n\nThey were working against time, but on Thorvald's part with practiced\nefficiency. Twice more that cry of the hunter arose from the depths\nbehind them. As the westering sun, almost down now, shone into the\nvalley hollow Thorvald set up the frame of his trap.\n\n\"We can't knock it out, any more than we can knock out a Throg. But a\nbeam from a stunner ought to slow it up long enough for this to work.\"\n\nTaggi burst out of the grass, approaching the hole with purpose. And\nTogi was right at his heels. Both of them stared into that opening,\ndrooling a little, the same eagerness in their pose as they had\ndisplayed when hunting. Shann remembered how that first howl of the\nThrog hound had drawn both animals to the edge of the occupied camp in\nspite of their marked distaste for its alien masters.\n\n\"They're after it too.\" He told Thorvald what he had noted on the night\nof their sortie.\n\n\"Maybe they can keep it occupied,\" the other commented. \"But we don't\nwant them to actually mix with it; that might be fatal.\"\n\nA clamor broke out in the interior passage. Taggi snarled, backing away\na few steps before he uttered his own war cry.\n\n\"Ready!\" Thorvald jumped to the net slung from the poles; Shann raised\nhis stunner.\n\nTogi underlined her mate's challenge with a series of snarls rising in\nvolume. There was a tearing, scrambling sound from within. Then Shann\nfired at the jack-in-the-box appearance of a monstrous head, and\nThorvald released the deadfall.\n\nThe thing squalled. Ropes beat, growing taut. The wolverines backed from\njaws which snapped fruitlessly. To Shann's relief the Terran animals\nappeared content to bait the now imprisoned--or collared--horror,\nwithout venturing to make any close attack.\n\nBut he reckoned that too soon. Perhaps the stunner had slowed up the\nhound's reflexes, for those jaws stilled with a last shattering snap,\nthe toad-lizard mask--a head which was against all nature as the Terrans\nknew it--was quiet in the strangle leash of the rope, the rest of the\nbody serving as a cork to fill the exit hole. Taggi had been waiting\nonly for such a chance. He sprang, claws ready. And Togi went in after\nher mate to share the battle.\n\n\n\n\n7. UNWELCOME GUIDE\n\n\nThere was a small eruption of earth and stone as the hound came alive,\nfighting to reach its tormentors. The resulting din was deafening.\nShann, avoiding by a hand's breadth a snap of jaws with power to crush\nhis leg into bone powder and mangled flesh, cuffed Togi across her nose\nand buried his hands in the fur about Taggi's throat as he heaved the\nmale wolverine back from the struggling monster. He shouted orders, and\nto his surprise Togi did obey, leaving him free to yank Taggi away.\nPerhaps neither wolverine had expected the full fury of the hound.\n\nThough he suffered a slash across the back of one hand, delivered by the\nover-excited Taggi, in the end Shann was able to get both animals away\nfrom the hole, now corked so effectively by the slavering thing.\nThorvald was actually laughing as he watched his younger companion in\naction.\n\n\"This ought to slow up the beetles! If they haul their little doggie\nback, it's apt to take out some of its rage on them, and I'd like to see\nthem dig around it.\"\n\nConsidering that the monstrous head was swinging from side to side in a\ncollar of what seemed to be immovable rocks, Shann thought Thorvald\nright. He went down on his knees beside the wolverines, soothing them\nwith hand and voice, trying to get them to obey his orders willingly.\n\n\"Ha!\" Thorvald brought his mud-stained hands together with a clap, the\nsharp sound attracting the attention of both animals.\n\nShann scrambled up, swung out his bleeding hand in the simple motion\nwhich meant to hunt, being careful to signal down the valley westward.\nTaggi gave a last reluctant growl at the hound, to be answered by one of\nits ear-torturing howls, and then trotted off, Togi tagging behind.\n\nThorvald caught Shann's slashed hand, inspecting the bleeding cut. From\nthe aid packet at his belt he brought out powder and a strip of\nprotecting plasta-flesh to cleanse and bind the wound.\n\n\"You'll do,\" he commented. \"But we'd better get out of here before full\ndark.\"\n\nThe small paradise of the valley was no safe campsite. It could not be\nso long as that monstrosity on the hillside behind them roared and\nhowled its rage to the darkening sky. Trailing the wolverines, the men\ncaught up with the animals drinking from a small spring and thankfully\nshared that water. Then they pushed on, not able to forget that\nsomewhere in the peaks about must lurk the Throg flyer ready to attack\non sight.\n\nOnly darkness could not be held off by the will of men. Here in the open\nthere was no chance to use the torch. As long as they were within the\nvalley boundaries the phosphorescent bushes marked a path. But by the\ncoming of complete darkness they were once more out in a region of bare\nrock.\n\nThe wolverines had killed a brace of skitterers, consuming hide and soft\nbones as well as the meager flesh which was not enough to satisfy their\nhunger. However, to Shann's relief, they did not wander too far ahead.\nAnd as the men stopped at last on a ledge where a fall of rock gave them\nsome limited shelter both animals crowded in against the humans, adding\nthe heat of their bodies to the slight comfort of that cramped resting\nplace.\n\nFrom time to time Shann was startled out of a troubled half sleep by the\nhowl of the hound. Luckily that sound never seemed any louder. If the\nThrogs had caught up with their hunter, and certainly they must have\ndone so by now, they either could not, or would not free it from the\ntrap. Shann dozed again, untroubled by any dreams, to awake hearing the\nshrieks of clak-claks. But when he studied the sky he was able to sight\nnone of the cliff-dwelling Warlockian bats.\n\n\"More likely they are paying attention to our friend back in the\nvalley,\" Thorvald said dryly, rightly reading Shann's glance to the\nclouds overhead. \"Ought to keep them busy.\"\n\nClak-claks were meat eaters, only they preferred their chosen prey weak\nand easy to attack. The imprisoned hound would certainly attract their\nkind. And those shrill cries now belling through the mountain heights\nought to draw everyone of their species within miles.\n\n\"There it is!\" Thorvald, pulling himself to his feet by a rock handhold,\ngazed westward, his gaunt face eager.\n\nShann, expecting no less than a cruising Throg ship, searched for cover\non their perch. Perhaps if they flattened themselves behind the fall of\nstones, they might be able to escape attention. Yet Thorvald made no\nmove into hiding. And so Shann followed the line of the other's fixed\nstare.\n\nBefore and below them lay a maze of heights and valleys, sharp drops,\nand saw-toothed rises. But on the far rim of that section of badlands\nshone the green of a Warlockian sea rippling on to the only dimly seen\nhorizon. They were now within sight of their goal.\n\nHad they had one of the exploration sky-flitters from the overrun camp,\nthey could have walked its beach sands within the hour. Instead, they\nfought their way through a Devil-designed country for the next two days.\nTwice they had narrow escapes from the Throg ship--or ships--which\ncontinued to sweep across the rugged line of the coast, and only a quick\ndive to cover, wasting precious time cowering like trapped animals,\nsaved them from discovery. But at least the hound did not bay again on\nthe tangled trail they left, and they hoped that the trap and the\nclak-claks had put that monster permanently out of service.\n\nOn the third day they came down to one of those fiords which tongued\ninland, fringing the coast. There had been no lack of hunting in the\nnarrow valleys through which they had threaded, so both men and\nwolverines were well fed. Though animal fur wore better than the now\ntattered uniforms of the men.\n\n\"Now where?\" Shann asked.\n\nWould he now learn the purpose driving Thorvald on to this coastland?\nCertainly such broken country afforded good hiding, but no better\nconcealment than the mountains of the interior.\n\nThe Survey officer turned slowly around on the shingle, studying the\nheights behind them as well as the angle of the inlet where the wavelets\nlapped almost at their battered boot tips. Opening his treasured map\ncase, he began a patient checking of landmarks against several of the\nstrips he carried. \"We'll have to get on down to the true coast.\"\n\nShann leaned against the trunk of a conical branched mountain tree,\npulling absently at the shreds of wine-colored bark being shed in\nseasonal change. The chill they had known in the upper valleys was\nsucceeded here by a humid warmth. Spring was becoming a summer such as\nthis northern continent knew. Even the fresh wind, blowing in from the\nouter sea, had already lost some of the bite they had felt two days\nbefore when its salt-laden mistiness had first struck them.\n\n\"Then what do we do there?\" Shann persisted.\n\nThorvald brought over the map, his black-rimmed nail tracing a route\ndown one of the fiords, slanting out to indicate a lace of islands\nextending in a beaded line across the sea.\n\n\"We head for these.\"\n\nTo Shann that made no sense at all. Those islands ... why, they would\noffer less chance of establishing a safe base than the broken land in\nwhich they now stood. Even the survey scouts had given those spots of\nsea-encircled earth the most cursory examination from the air.\n\n\"Why?\" he asked bluntly. So far he had followed orders because they had\nfor the most part made sense. But he was not giving obedience to\nThorvald as a matter of rank alone.\n\n\"Because there is something out there, something which may make all the\ndifference now. Warlock isn't an empty world.\"\n\nShann jerked free a long thong of loose bark, rolling it between his\nfingers. Had Thorvald cracked? He knew that the officer had disagreed\nwith the findings of the team and had been an unconvinced minority of\none who had refused to subscribe to the report that Warlock had no\nnative intelligent life and therefore was ready and waiting for human\nsettlement because it was technically an empty world. But to continue to\ncling to that belief without a single concrete proof was certainly a\nsign of mental imbalance.\n\nAnd Thorvald was regarding him now with frowning impatience. You were\nsupposed to humor delusions, weren't you? Only, could you surrender and\nhumor a wild idea which might mean your death? If Thorvald wanted to go\nisland-hopping in chance of discovering what never had existed, Shann\nneed not accompany him. And if the officer tried to use force, well,\nShann was armed with a stunner, and had, he believed, more control over\nthe wolverines. Perhaps if he merely gave lip agreement to this\nproject.... Only he didn't believe, noting the light deep in those gray\neyes holding on him, that anybody could talk Thorvald out of this\nparticular obsession.\n\n\"You don't believe me, do you?\" The impatience arose hotly in that\ndemand.\n\n\"Why shouldn't I?\" Shann tried to temporize. \"You've had a lot of\nexploration experience; you should know about such things. I don't\npretend to be any authority.\"\n\nThorvald refolded the map and placed it in the case. Then he pulled at\nthe sealing of his blouse, groping in an inner secret pocket. He\nuncurled his fingers to display his treasure.\n\nOn his palm lay a coin-shaped medallion, bone-white but possessing an\nodd luster which bone would not normally show. And it was carved. Shann\nput out a finger, though he had a strange reluctance to touch the\nobject. When he did he experienced a sensation close to the tingle of a\nmild electric shock. And once he had made that contact, he was also\nimpelled to pick up that disk and examine it more closely.\n\nThe carved pattern was very intricate and had been done with great\ndelicacy and skill, though the whorls, oddly shaped knobs, ribbon\ntracings, made no connected design he could determine. After a moment or\ntwo of study, Shann became aware that his eyes, following those twists\nand twirls, were \"fixed,\" that it required a distinct effort to look\naway from the thing. Feeling some of that same alarm as he had known\nwhen he first heard the wailing of the Throg hound, he let the disk fall\nback into Thorvald's hold, even more disturbed when he discovered that\nto relinquish his grasp required some exercise of will.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nThorvald restored the coin to his hiding place.\n\n\"You tell me. I can say this much, there is no listing for anything even\nremotely akin to this in the Archives.\"\n\nShann's eyes widened. He absently rubbed the fingers which had held the\nbone coin--if it was a coin--back and forth across the torn front of his\nblouse. That tingle ... did he still feel it? Or was his imagination at\nwork again? But an object not listed in the exhaustive Survey Archives\nwould mean some totally new civilization, a new stellar race.\n\n\"It is definitely a created article,\" the Survey officer continued. \"And\nit was found on the beach of one of those sea islands.\"\n\n\"Throg?\" But Shann already knew the answer to that.\n\n\"Throg work--_this_?\" Thorvald was openly scornful. \"Throgs have no\nconception of such art. You must have seen their metal plates--those are\nthe beetle-heads' idea of beauty. Have those the slightest resemblance\nto this?\"\n\n\"Then who made it?\"\n\n\"Either Warlock has--or once had--a native race advanced enough in a\nwell-established form of civilization to develop such a sophisticated\ntype of art, or there have been other visitors from space here before us\nand the Throgs. And the latter possibility I don't believe----\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because this was carved of bone or an allied substance. We haven't been\nquite able to identify it in the labs, but it is basically organic\nmaterial. It was found exposed to the weather and yet it is in perfect\ncondition, could have been carved any time within the past five years.\nIt has been handled, yes, but not roughly. And we have come across\nevidences of no other star-cruising races or species save ourselves and\nthe Throgs. No, I say this was made here on Warlock, not too long ago,\nand by intelligent beings of a very high grade of civilization.\"\n\n\"But they would have cities,\" protested Shann. \"We've been here for\nmonths, explored all over this continent. We would have seen them or\nsome traces of them.\"\n\n\"An old race, maybe,\" Thorvald mused, \"a very old race, perhaps in\ndecline, reduced to a remnant in numbers with good reason to retire into\nhiding. No, we've discovered no cities, no evidence of a native culture\npast or present. But this--\" he touched the front of his blouse--\"was\nfound on the shore of an island. We may have been looking in the wrong\nplace for our natives.\"\n\n\"The sea....\" Shann glanced with new interest at the green water surging\nin wavelets along the edge of the fiord.\n\n\"Just so, the sea!\"\n\n\"But scouts have been here for more than a year, one team or another.\nAnd nobody saw anything or found any traces.\"\n\n\"All four of our base camps were set inland, our explorations along the\ncoast were mainly carried out by flitter, except for one party--the one\nwhich found this. And there may be excellent local reasons why any\nnative never showed himself to us. For that matter, they may not be able\nto exist on land at all, any more than we could live without artificial\naids in the sea.\"\n\n\"Now----?\"\n\n\"Now we must make a real attempt to find them if they do exist anywhere\nnear here. A friendly native race could make all the difference in the\nworld in any struggle with the Throgs.\"\n\n\"Then you did have more than the dreams to back you when you argued with\nFenniston!\" Shann cut in.\n\nThorvald's eyes were on him again. \"When did you hear that, Lantee?\"\n\nTo his great embarrassment, Shann found himself flushing. \"I heard you,\nthe day you left for Headquarters,\" he admitted, and then added in his\nown defense, \"Probably half the camp did, too.\"\n\nThorvald's gathering frown flickered away. He gave a snort of laughter.\n\"Yes, I guess we did rather get to the bellowing point that morning. The\ndreams--\" he came back to the subject--\"Yes, the dreams\nwere--are--important. We had their warning from the start. Lorry was the\nFirst-In Scout who charted Warlock, and he is a good man. I guess I can\nbreak secret now to tell you that his ship was equipped with a new\nexperimental device which recorded--well, you might call it an\n\"emanation\"--a radiation so faint its source could not be traced. And it\nregistered whenever Lorry had one of those dreams. Unfortunately, the\nmachine was very new, very much in the untested stage, and its\nperformance when checked later in the lab was erratic enough so the\npowers-that-be questioned all its readings. They produced a half dozen\nanswers to account for that tape, and Lorry only caught the recording as\nlong as he was on a big bay to the south.\n\n\"Then when two check flights came in later, carrying perfected machines\nand getting no recordings, it was all written off as a mistake in the\nfirst experiment. A planet such as Warlock is too big a find to throw\naway when there was no proof of occupancy. And the settlement boys\nrushed matters right along.\"\n\nShann recalled his own vivid dream of the skull-rock set in the lap of\nwater--this sea? And another small point fell into place to furnish the\nbeginning of a pattern. \"I was asleep on the raft when I dreamed about\nthat skullmountain,\" he said slowly, wondering if he were making sense.\n\nThorvald's head came up with the alert stance of Taggi on a strong game\nscent.\n\n\"Yes, on the raft you dreamed of a skull-rock. And I of a cavern with a\ngreen veil. Both of us were on water--water which had an eventual\nconnection with the sea. Could water be a conductor? I wonder....\" Once\nagain his hand went into his blouse. He crossed the strip of gravel\nbeach and dipped fingers into the water, letting the drops fall on the\ncarved disk he now held in his other hand.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Shann could see no purpose in that.\n\nThorvald did not answer. He had pressed wet hand to dry now, palm to\npalm, the coin cupped tightly between them. He turned a quarter circle,\nto face the still distant open sea.\n\n\"That way.\" He spoke with a new odd tonelessness.\n\nShann stared into the other's face. All the eager alertness of only a\nmoment earlier had been wiped away. Thorvald was no longer the man he\nhad known, but in some frightening way a husk, holding a quite different\npersonality. The younger Terran answered his fear with an attack from\nthe old days of rough in-fighting in the Dumps of Tyr. He brought his\nright hand down hard in a sharp chop across the officer's wrists. The\nbone coin spun to the sand and Thorvald stumbled, staggering forward a\nstep or two. Before he could recover balance Shann had stamped on the\nmedallion.\n\nThorvald whirled, his stunner drawn with a speed for which Shann gave\nhim high marks. But the younger man's own weapon was already out and\nready. And he talked--fast.\n\n\"That thing's dangerous! What did you do--what did it do to you?\"\n\nHis demand got through to a Thorvald who was himself again.\n\n\"What was _I_ doing?\" came a counter demand.\n\n\"You were acting like a mind-controlled.\"\n\nThorvald stared at him incredulously, then with a growing spark of\ninterest.\n\n\"The minute you dripped water on that thing you changed,\" Shann\ncontinued.\n\nThorvald reholstered his stunner. \"Yes,\" he mused, \"why _did_ I want to\ndrip water on it? Something prompted me ...\" He ran his still damp hand\nup the angle of his jaw, across his forehead as if to relieve some pain\nthere. \"What else did I do?\"\n\n\"Faced to the sea and said 'that way,'\" Shann replied promptly.\n\n\"And why did you move in to stop me?\"\n\nShann shrugged. \"When I first touched that thing I felt a shock. And\nI've seen mind-controlled----\" He could have bitten his tongue for\nbetraying that. The world of the mind-controlled was very far from the\nlife Thorvald and his kind knew.\n\n\"Very interesting,\" commented the other. \"For one of so few years you\nseem to have seen a lot, Lantee--and apparently remembered most of it.\nBut I would agree that you are right about this little plaything; it\ncarries a danger with it, being far less innocent than it looks.\" He\ntore off one of the fluttering scraps of rag which now made up his\nsleeve. \"If you'll just remove your foot, we'll put it out of business\nfor now.\"\n\nHe proceeded to wrap the disk well in his bit of cloth, taking care not\nto touch it again with his bare fingers while he stowed it away.\n\n\"I don't know what we have in this--a key to unlock a door, a trap to\ncatch the unwary. I can't guess how or why it works. But we can be\nreasonably sure it's not just some carefree maiden's locket, nor the\nequivalent of a credit to spend in the nearest bar. So it pointed me to\nthe sea, did it? Well, that much I am willing to allow. Maybe we'll be\nable to return it to the owner, _after_ we learn who--or what--that\nowner is.\"\n\nShann gazed down at the green water, opaque, not to be pierced to the\ndepths by human sight. Anything might lurk there. Suddenly the Throgs\nbecame normal when balanced against an unknown living in the murky\ndepths of an aquatic world. Another attack on the Throg-held camp could\nbe well preferred to such exploration as Thorvald had in mind. Yet Shann\ndid not voice any protest as the Survey officer faced again in the same\ndirection as the disk had pointed him moments before.\n\n\n\n\n8. UTGARD\n\n\nA wind from the west sprang up an hour before sunset, lashing waves\ninland until their spray was a salt mist in the air, a mist to sodden\nclothing, plaster hair to the skull, leaving a brine slime across the\nskin. Yet Thorvald hunted no shelter, in spite of the promise in the\nrough shoreline at their backs. The sand in which their boots slipped\nand slid was coarse stuff, hardly finer than gravel, studded with nests\nof drift--bone-white or grayed or pale lavender--smoothed and stored by\nthe seasons of low tides and high, seasonal storms and hurricanes. A\nwild shore and a forbidding one, to arouse Shann's distrust, perhaps a\nfitting goal for that disk's guiding.\n\nShann had tasted loneliness in the mountains, experienced the strange\nworld of the river at night lighted by the wan radiance of glowing\nshrubs and plants, forced the starkness of the heights. Yet there had\nbeen through all that journeying a general resemblance to his own past\non other worlds. A tree was a tree, whether it bore purple foliage or\nwas red-veined. A rock was a rock, a river a river. They were equally\nhard and wet on Warlock or Tyr.\n\nBut now a veil he could not describe, even in his own thoughts, hung\nbetween him and the sand over which he walked, between him and the sea\nwhich sent spray to wet his torn clothing, between him and that wild\nwrack of long-ago storms. He could put out his hand and touch sand,\ndrift, spray; yet they were a setting where something lay hidden behind\nthat setting--something watched, calculatingly, with intelligence, and\na set of emotions and values he did not, could not share.\n\n\"... storm coming.\" Thorvald paused in the buffeting of wind and spray,\nwatching the fury of the tossing sea. The sun was still a pale smear\njust above the horizon. And it gave light enough to make out that\ntrickle of islands melting out to obscurity.\n\n\"Utgard----\"\n\n\"Utgard?\" Shann repeated, the strange word holding no meaning for him.\n\n\"Legend of my people.\" Thorvald smeared spray from his face with one\nhand. \"Utgard, those outermost islands where dwell the giants who are\nthe mortal enemies of the old gods.\"\n\nThose dark lumps, most of them bare rock, only a few crowned with\nstunted vegetation, might well harbor _anything_, Shann decided, giants\nor the malignant spirits of any race. Perhaps even the Throgs had their\ntales of evil things in the night, beetle monsters to people wild,\nunknown lands. He caught at Thorvald's arm and suggested a practical\ncourse of action.\n\n\"We'll need shelter before the storm strikes.\" To Shann's relief the\nother nodded.\n\nThey trailed back across the beach, their backs now to the sea and\nUtgard. That harsh-sounding name did so well fit the line of islands and\nislets, Shann repeated it to himself. Here the beach was narrow, a strip\nof blue sand-gravel walled by wave-worn boulders. And from that barrier\nof stones piled into a breastwork by chance, interwoven with bone-bare\ndrift, arose the first of the cliffs. Shann studied the terrain with\nincreasing uneasiness. To be caught between a sea, whipped inland by a\nstorm wind, and that cliff would be a risk he did not like to consider,\nas ignorant of field lore as he was. They must locate some break nearer\nthan the fiord, down which they had come. And they must find it soon,\nbefore the daylight was gone and the full fury of bad weather struck.\n\nIn the end the wolverines discovered an exit, just as they had found the\npassage through the mountain. Taggi nosed into a darker line down the\nface of the cliff and disappeared, Togi duplicating that feat. Shann\ntrailed them, finding the opening a tight squeeze.\n\nHe squirmed into dimness, his outstretched hands meeting a rough stone\nsurface sloping upward. After gaining a point about eight feet above the\nbeach he was able to look back and down through the seaward slit. Open\nto the sky the crevice proved a doorway to a narrow valley, not unlike\nthose which housed the fiords, but provided with a thick growth of\nvegetation well protected by the high walls.\n\nWorking as a now well-rehearsed team, the men set up a shelter of\nsaplings and brush, the back to the slit through which wind was still\nable to tear a way. Walled in by stone and knowing that no Throg flyer\nwould attempt to fly in the face of the coming storm, they dared make a\nfire. The warmth was a comfort to their bodies, just as the light of the\nflames, men's age-old hearth companion, was a comfort to the fugitives'\nspirits. Those dancing spears of red, for Shann at least, burned away\nthat veil of other-worldliness which had enwrapped the beach, providing\nin the night an illusion of the home he had never really known.\n\nBut the wind and the weather did not keep truce very long. A wailing\nblast around the upper peaks produced a caterwauling to equal the voices\nof half a dozen Throg hounds. And in their poor shelter the Terrans not\nonly heard the thunderous boom of surf, but felt the vibration of that\nbeat pounding through the very ground on which they lay. The sea must\nhave long since covered the beach over which they had come and was now\ntrying its strength against the rock of the cliff barrier. They could\nnot talk to each other over that din, although shoulder touched\nshoulder.\n\nThe last flush of amber vanished from the sky with the speed of a\ndropped curtain. Tonight no period of twilight divided night from day,\nbut their portion of Warlock was plunged abruptly into darkness. The\nwolverines crowded into their small haven, whining deep in their\nthroats. Shann ran his hands along their furred bodies, trying to give\nthem a reassurance he himself did not feel. Never before when on stable\nland had he been so aware of the unleashed terrors nature could exert,\nthe forces against which all mankind's controls were as nothing.\n\nTime could no longer be measured by any set of minutes or hours. There\nwas only darkness, the howling winds, and the salty rain which must be\nin part the breath of the sea driven in upon them. The comforting fire\nvanished, chill and dankness crept up to cramp their bodies, so that now\nand again they were forced to their feet, to swing arms, stamp, drive\nthe blood into faster circulation.\n\nLater came a time when the wind died, no longer driving the rain\nbullet-hard against and through their flimsy shelter. Then they slept in\nthe thick unconsciousness of exhaustion.\n\nA red-purple skull--and from its eye sockets the flying things--kept\ncoming ... going.... Shann trod on an unsteady foundation which dipped\nunder his weight as had the raft of the river voyage. He was drawing\nnearer to that great head, could see now how waves curled about the\nangle of the lower jaw, slapping inward between gaps of missing\nteeth--which were really broken fangs of rock--as if the skull now and\nthen sucked reviving moisture from the water. The aperture marking the\nnose was closer to a snout, and the hole was dark, dark as the empty eye\nsockets. Yet that darkness was drawing him past any effort to escape he\ncould summon. And then that on which he rode so perilously was carried\nforward by the waves, grated against the jawbone, while against his own\nfighting will his hands arose above his head, reaching for a hold to\ndraw his shrinking body up the stark surface to that snout-passage.\n\n\"Lantee!\" A hand jerked him back, broke that compulsion--and the dream.\nShann opened his eyes with difficulty, his lashes seemed glued to his\ncheeks.\n\nHe might have been surveying a submerged world. Thin streamers of fog\ntwined up from the earth as if they grew from seeds planted by the\nstorm. But there was no wind, no sound from the peaks. Only under his\nstiff body Shann could still feel that vibration which was the sea\nbattering against the cliff wall.\n\nThorvald was crouched beside him, his hand still urgent on the younger\nman's shoulder. The officer's face was drawn so finely that his\nfeatures, sharp under the tanned skin, were akin to the skull Shann\nstill half saw among the ascending pillars of fog.\n\n\"Storm's over.\"\n\nShann shivered as he sat up, hugging his arms to his chest, his tattered\nuniform soggy under that pressure. He felt as if he would never be warm\nagain. When he moved sluggishly to the pit where they had kindled their\nhandful of fire the night before he realized that the wolverines were\nmissing.\n\n\"Taggi----?\" His voice sounded rusty in his own ears, as if some of the\nmoisture thick in the air about them had affected his vocal cords.\n\n\"Hunting.\" Thorvald's answer was clipped. He was gathering a handful of\nsticks from the back of their lean-to, where the protection of their own\nbodies had kept that kindling dry. Shann snapped a length between his\nhands, dropped it into the pit.\n\nWhen they did coax a blaze into being they stripped, wringing out their\nclothing, propping it piece by steaming piece on sticks by the warmth of\nthe flames. The moist air bit at their bodies and they moved briskly,\nstriving to keep warm by exercise. Still the fog curled, undisturbed by\nany shaft of sun.\n\n\"Did you dream?\" Thorvald asked abruptly.\n\n\"Yes.\" Shann did not elaborate. Disturbing as his dream had been, the\nfeeling that it was not to be shared was also strong, as strong as some\norder.\n\n\"And so did I,\" Thorvald said bleakly. \"You saw your skull-mountain?\"\n\n\"I was climbing it when you awoke me,\" Shann returned unwillingly.\n\n\"And I was going through my green veil when Taggi took off and wakened\nme. You are sure your skull exists?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And so am I that the cavern of the veil is somewhere on this world. But\nwhy?\" Thorvald stood up, the firelight marking plainly the lines between\nhis tanned arms, his brown face and throat, and the paleness of his lean\nbody. \"Why do we dream those particular dreams?\"\n\nShann tested the dryness of a shirt. He had no reason to try and explain\nthe wherefore of those dreams, only was he certain that he would\nsometime, somewhere, find that skull, and that when he did he would\nclimb to the doorway of the snout, pass behind to depths where the\nflying things might nest--not because he wanted to make such an\nexpedition, but because he must.\n\nHe drew his hands across his ribs, where pressure still brought an\naching reminder of the crushing force of the energy whip the Throgs had\nwielded. There was no extra flesh on his body, yet muscles slid easily\nunder the skin, a darker skin than Thorvald's, deepening to a warm brown\nwhere it had been weathered. His hair, unclipped now for a month, was\nbeginning to curl about his head in tight dark rings. Since he had\nalways been the youngest or the smallest or the weakest in the world of\nthe Dumps, of the Service, of the Team, Shann had very little personal\nvanity. He did possess a different type of pride, born of his own\nstubborn achievement in winning out over a long roster of\ndiscouragements, failures, and adverse odds.\n\n\"Why do we dream?\" he repeated Thorvald's question. \"No answer, sir.\" He\ngave the traditional reply of the Service recruit. And a little to his\nsurprise Thorvald laughed with a tinge of real amusement.\n\n\"Where do you come from, Lantee?\" He asked as if he were honestly\ninterested.\n\n\"Tyr.\"\n\n\"Caldon mines.\" The Survey officer automatically matched planet to\nproduct. \"How did you come into Survey?\"\n\nShann drew on his shirt. \"Signed on as casual labor,\" he returned with a\nspark of defiance. Thorvald had joined the Service the right way as a\ncadet, then a Team man, finally an officer, climbing that nice even\nladder with every rung ready for him when he was prepared to mount it.\nWhat did his kind know about the labor Barracks where the dull-minded,\nthe failures, the petty criminals on the run, lived hard under a secret\nsocial system of their own? It had taken every bit of physical endurance\nand energy, every fraction of stubborn will Shann could summon, for him\nto survive his first three months in those barracks--unbroken and still\neager to be Survey. He could still wonder at the unbelievable chance\nwhich had rescued him from that merely because Training Center had\nneeded another odd hand to clean cages and feed troughs for the\nexperimental animals.\n\nAnd from the center he made a Team, because when working in a smaller\ngroup his push and attention to duty had been noticed and had paid off.\nThree years it had taken, but he _had_ made Team stature. Not that that\nmeant anything now. Shann pulled his boots on over the legs of rough\ndried coveralls and glanced up, to find Thorvald watching him with a\nnew, questioning directness the younger man could not understand.\n\nShann sealed his blouse and stood up, knowing the bite of hunger, dull\nbut persistent. It was a feeling he had had so many times in the past\nthat now he hardly gave it a second thought.\n\n\"Supplies?\" He brought the subject back to the present and the\npractical. What did it matter why or how one Shann Lantee had come to\nWarlock in the first place?\n\n\"What we have left of the concentrates we had better keep for\nemergencies.\" Thorvald made no move to open the very shrunken bag he had\nbrought from the scoutship.\n\nHe walked over to a rocky outcrop and tugged loose a yellowish tuft of\nplant, neither moss nor fungi but sharing attributes of both. Shann\nrecognized it without enthusiasm as one of the varieties of native\nproduce which could be safely digested by Terran stomachs. The stuff was\nalmost tasteless and possessed a rather unpleasant odor. Consumed in\nbulk it would satisfy hunger for a time. Shann hoped that with the\nwolverines to aid they could go back to hunting soon.\n\nHowever, Thorvald showed no desire to head inland where they might\nexpect to locate game. He disagreed with Shann's suggestion for tracking\nTaggi and Togi when those two emerged from the underbrush obviously well\nfed and contented after their early morning activity.\n\nWhen Shann protested with some heat, the other countered: \"Didn't you\never hear of fish, Lantee? After a storm such as last night's, we ought\nto discover good pickings along the shore.\"\n\nBut Shann was also sure that it was not only the thought of food which\ndrew Thorvald back to the sea.\n\nThey crawled back through the bolt hole. The beach of gravel-sand had\nvanished save for a narrow ribbon of land just at the foot of the\ncliffs, where the water curled in white lace about the barrier of\nboulders. There was no change in the dullness of the sky; no sun broke\nthrough the thick lid of clouds. And the green of the sea was ashened to\ngray which matched that overcast until one could strain one's eyes\ntrying to find the horizon, unable to mark the dividing line here\nbetween air and water.\n\nUtgard was a broken necklace, the outermost island-beads lost, the inner\nones more isolated by the rise in water, more forbidding. Shann let out\na startled hiss of breath.\n\nThe top of a near-by rock detached itself, drew up into a hunched thing\nof armor-plated scales and heavy wide-jawed head. A tail cracked into\nthe air; a double tail split into equal forks for half-way down its\nlength. A leg lifted as a forefoot, webbed, clawed for a new hold. This\nsea beast was the most formidable native thing he had sighted on\nWarlock, approaching in its ugliness the hound of the Throgs.\n\nBreathing in labored gusts, the thing slapped its tail down on the\nstones with a limpness which suggested that the raising of that\nappendage had overtaxed its limited supply of strength. The head sank\nforward, resting across one of the forelimbs. Then Shann sighted the\nfearsome wound in the side just before one of the larger hind legs, a\nragged hole through which pumped with every one of those breaths a dark\npurplish stream, licked away by the waves as it trickled slickly down\nthe rock.\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\nThorvald shook his head. \"Not on our records,\" he replied absently,\nstudying the dying creature with avid attention. \"Must have been driven\nin by the storm. This proves there is more in the sea then we knew!\"\n\nAgain the forked tail lifted and fell, the head, raised from the\nforelimb, stretching up and back until the white underfolds of the\nthroat were exposed as the snout pointed almost vertically to the sky.\nThe jaws opened and from between them came a moaning whistle, a\ncomplaint which was drowned out by the wash of the waves. Then, as if\nthat was the last effort, the webbed, clawed feet relaxed their grip of\nthe rock and the scaled body slid sidewise, out of their sight, into the\nwater. There was a feather of spume to mark the plunge and nothing else.\n\nShann, watching to see if the reptile would surface again, sighted\nanother object, a rounded shape floating on the sea, bobbing lightly as\nhad their river raft.\n\n\"Look!\"\n\nThorvald's gaze followed his pointing finger and then before Shann could\nprotest, the officer leaped outward from their perch on the cliff to the\nbroad rock where the scaled sea dweller had lain moments earlier. He\nstood there, watching that drifting object with the closest attention,\nas Shann made the same crossing in his wake.\n\nThe drifting thing was oval, perhaps some six feet long and three wide,\nthe mid point rising in a curve from the water's edge. As far as Shann\ncould make out in the half-light the color was a reddish-brown, the\nsurface rough. And he thought by the way that it moved that it must be\nflotsam of the storm, buoyant enough to ride the waves with close to\ncork resiliency. To Shann's dismay his companion began to strip.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Get that.\"\n\nShann surveyed the water about the rock. The forked tail had sunk just\nthere. Was the Survey officer mad enough to think he could swim\nunmenaced through a sea which might be infested with more such\ncreatures? It seemed that he was, for Thorvald's white body arched out\nin a dive. Shann waited, half crouched and tense, as though he could in\nsome way attack anything rising from the depths to strike at his\ncompanion.\n\nA brown arm flashed above the surface. Thorvald swam strongly toward the\nfloating object. He reached it, his outstretched hand rasping across the\nsurface. And it responded so quickly to that touch that Shann guessed it\nwas even lighter and easier to handle than he had first thought.\n\nThorvald headed back, herding the thing before him. And when he climbed\nout on the rock, Shann was pulling up his trophy. They flipped the find\nover, to discover it hollow. They had, in effect, a ready-made craft not\nunlike a canoe with blunted bows. But the substance was surely organic:\nWas it shell? Shann speculated, running his finger tips over the\nirregular surface.\n\nThe Survey officer dressed. \"We have our boat,\" he commented. \"Now for\nUtgard--\"\n\nUse this frail thing to dare the trip to the islands? But Shann did not\nprotest. If the officer determined to try such a voyage, he would do it.\nAnd neither did the younger man doubt that he would accompany Thorvald.\n\n\n\n\n9. ONE ALONE\n\n\nOnce again the beach was a wide expanse of shingle, drying fast under a\nsun hotter than any Shann had yet known on Warlock. Summer had taken a\nbig leap forward. The Terrans worked in partial shade below a cliff\noverhang, not only for the protection against the sun's rays, but also\nas a precaution against any roving Throg air patrol.\n\nUnder Thorvald's direction the curious shell dragged from the sea--if it\nwere a shell, and the texture as well as the general shape suggested\nthat--was equipped with a framework to act as a stabilizing outrigger.\nWhat resulted was certainly an odd-looking craft, but one which obeyed\nthe paddles and rode the waves easily.\n\nIn the full sunlight the outline of islands was\nclear-cut--red-and-gray-rock above an aquamarine sea. The Terrans had\nsighted no more of the sea monsters, and the major evidence of native\nlife along the shore was a new species of clak-claks, roosting in cliff\nholes and scavenging along the sands, and various queer fish and shelled\nthings stranded in small tide pools--to the delight of the wolverines,\nwho fished eagerly up and down the beach, ready to investigate all\ndebris of the storm.\n\n\"That should serve.\" Thorvald tightened the last lashing, straightening\nup, his fists resting on his hips, to regard the craft with a measure of\npride.\n\nShann was not quite so content. He had matched the Survey officer in\nindustry, but the need for haste still eluded him. So the ship--such as\nit was--was ready. Now they would be off to explore Thorvald's Utgard.\nBut a small and nagging doubt inside the younger man restrained his\nenthusiasm over such a voyage. Fork-tail had come out of the section of\nocean which they must navigate in this very crude transport. And Shann\nhad no desire to meet an uninjured and alert fork-tail in the latter's\nown territory.\n\n\"Which island do we head for?\" Shann kept private his personal doubts of\ntheir success. The outmost tip of that chain was only a distant smudge\nlying low on the water.\n\n\"The largest ... that one with trees.\"\n\nShann whistled. Since the night of the storm the wolverines were again\nmore amenable to the very light discipline he tried to keep. Perhaps the\nfury of that elemental burst had tightened the bond between men and\nanimals, both alien to this world. Now Taggi and his mate padded toward\nhim in answer to his summons. But would the wolverines trust the boat?\nShann dared not risk their swimming, nor would he agree to leaving them\nbehind.\n\nThorvald had already stored their few provisions on board. And now Shann\nsteadied the craft against a rock which served them as a wharf, while he\ncoaxed Taggi gently. Though the wolverine protested, he at last\nscrambled in, to hunch at the bottom of the shell, the picture of\napprehension. Togi took longer to make up her mind. And at length Shann\npicked her up bodily, soothing her with quiet speech and stroking hands,\nto put her beside her mate.\n\nThe shell settled under the weight of the passengers, but Thorvald's\nforesight concerning the use of the outrigger proved right, for the\ncraft was seaworthy. It answered readily to the dip of their paddles as\nthey headed in a curve, keeping the first of the islands between them\nand the open sea for a breakwater.\n\nFrom the air, Thorvald's course would have been a crooked one, for he\nwove back and forth between the scattered islands of the chain, using\ntheir lee calm for the protection of the canoe. About two thirds of the\ngroup were barren rock, inhabited only by clak-claks and creatures\ncloser to true Terran birds in that they wore a body plumage which\nresembled feathers, though their heads were naked and leathery. And,\nShann noted, the clak-claks and the birds did not roost on the same\nislands, each choosing their own particular home while the other species\ndid not invade that territory.\n\nThe first large-sized island they approached was crowned by trees, but\nit had no beach, no approach from sea level. Perhaps it might be\npossible to climb to the top of the cliff walls. But Thorvald did not\nsuggest that they try it, heading on toward the next large outcrop of\nland and rock.\n\nHere white lace patterned in a ring well out from the shore to mark a\ncircle of reefs. They nosed their way patiently around the outer\ncircumference of that threatening barrier, hunting the entrance to the\nlagoon. Within, there were at least two beaches with climbable ascents\nto the upper reaches inland. Though Shann noted that the vegetation\nshowing was certainly not luxuriant, the few trees within their range of\nvision being pallid growths, rather like those they had sighted on the\nfringe of the desert. Leather-headed flyers wheeled out over their\ncanoe, coasting on outspread wings to peer down at the Terran invaders\nin a manner which suggested intelligent curiosity.\n\nA full flock gathered to escort them as they continued along the outer\nline of the reef. Thorvald impatiently dug his paddle deeper. They had\nexplored more than half of the reef now without chancing on an entrance\nchannel.\n\n\"Regular fence,\" Shann commented. One could begin to believe that the\nbarrier had been deliberately reared to frustrate visitors. Hot\nsunshine, reflected back from the surface of the waves, burned their\nexposed skin, so they dared not discard their ragged clothing. And the\nwolverines were growing increasingly restless. Shann did not know how\nmuch longer the animals would consent to their position as passengers\nwithout raising active protest.\n\n\"How about trying the next one?\" he asked, knowing at the same time his\ncompanion was not in any mood to accept such a suggestion with good\nwill.\n\nThe officer made no reply, but continued to use his steer paddle in a\nfashion which spelled out his stubborn determination to find a passage.\nThis was a personal thing now, between Ragnar Thorvald of the Terran\nSurvey and a wall of rock, and the man's will was as strongly rooted as\nthose water-washed stones.\n\nOn the southwestern tip of the reef they discovered a possible opening.\nShann eyed the narrow space between two fanglike rocks dubiously. To him\nthat width of water lane seemed dangerously limited, the sudden slam of\na wave could dash them against either of those pillars, with disastrous\nresults, before they could move to save themselves. But Thorvald pointed\ntheir blunt bow toward the passage with seeming confidence, and Shann\nknew that as far as the officer was concerned, this was their door to\nthe lagoon.\n\nThorvald might be stubborn, but he was not a fool. And his training and\nskill in such maneuvers was proved when the canoe rode in a rising swell\nin and by those rocks to gain the safety, in seconds, of the calm\nlagoon. Shann sighed with relief, but ventured no comment.\n\nNow they must paddle back along the inner side of the reef to locate the\nbeaches, for fronting them on this side of the well-protected island\nwere cliffs as formidable as those which guarded the first of the chain\nat which they had aimed.\n\nShann glanced now and then over the side of the boat, hoping in these\nshallows to sight the sea bed or some of the inhabitants of these\nwaters. But there was no piercing that green murk. Here and there\nnodules of rock projected inches or feet above the surface, awash in the\nwavelets, to be avoided by the voyagers. Shann's shoulders ached and\nburned, his muscles were unaccustomed to the steady swing of the\npaddles, and the fire of the sun stabbed easily through only two layers\nof ragged cloth to his skin. He ran a dry tongue over dryer lips and\ngazed eagerly ahead in search of the first of the beaches.\n\nWhat was so important about this island that Thorvald _had_ to make a\nlanding here? The officer's stories of a native race which they might\nturn against the Throgs to their own advantage was thin, very thin\nindeed. Especially now, as Shann weighed an unsupported theory against\nthat ache in his shoulders, the possibility of being marooned on the\ninhospitable shore ahead, against the fifty probable dangers he could\ntotal up with very little expenditure of effort. A small nagging doubt\nof Thorvald's obsession began to grow in his mind. How could Shann even\nbe sure that that carved disk and Thorvald's hokus-pokus with it had\nbeen on the level? On the other hand what motive would the officer have\nfor trying such an act just to impress Shann?\n\nThe beach at last! As they headed the canoe in that direction the\nwolverines nearly brought disaster on them. The animals' restlessness\nbecame acute as they sighted and scented the shore and knew that they\nwere close. Taggi reared, plunged over the side of the craft, and Shann\nhad just time to fling his weight in the opposite direction as a\ncounterbalance when Togi followed. They splashed shoreward while\nThorvald swore fluently and Shann grabbed to save the precious supply\nbag. In a shower of gravel the animals made land and humped well up on\nthe strand before pausing to shake themselves and splatter far and wide\nthe burden of moisture transported by their shaggy fur.\n\nAshore, the canoe became a clumsy burden and, light as the craft was,\nboth of the men sweated to get it up on the beach without snagging the\noutrigger against stones and brush. With the thought of a Throg patrol\nin mind they worked swiftly to cover it.\n\nTaggi raised an egg-patterned snout from a hollow and licked at the\nstippling of greenish yolk matting his fur. The wolverines had wasted no\ntime in sampling the contents of a wealth of nesting places beginning\njust above the high-water mark, cupping two to four tough-shelled eggs\nin each. Treading a path among those clutches, the Terrans climbed a\nred-earthed slope toward the interior of the island.\n\nThey found water, not the clear running of a mountain spring, but a\nstalish pool in a stone-walled depression on the crest of a rise,\nfilled by the bounty of the rain. The warm liquid was brackish, but\nsatisfied in part their thirst, and they drank eagerly.\n\nThe outer cliff wall of the island was just that, a wall, for there was\nan inner slope to match the outer. And at the bottom of it a showing of\npurple-green foliage where plants and stunted trees fought for living\nspace. But there was nothing else, though they quartered that growing\nsection with the care of men trying to locate an enemy outpost.\n\nThat night they camped in the hollow, roasted eggs in a fire, and ate\nthe fishy-tasting contents because it was food, not because they\nrelished what they swallowed. Tonight no cloud bank hung overhead. A\nman, gazing up, could see the stars. The stars and other things, for\nover the distant shore of the mainland they sighted the cruising lights\nof a Throg ship and waited tensely for that circle of small sparkling\npoints to swing out toward their own hiding hole.\n\n\"They haven't given up,\" Shann stated what was obvious to them both.\n\n\"The settler transport,\" Thorvald reminded him. \"If they do not take a\nprisoner to talk her in and allay suspicion, then--\" he snapped his\nfingers--\"the Patrol will be on their tails, but quick!\"\n\nSo just by keeping out of Throg range, they were, in a way, still\nfighting. Shann settled back, his tender shoulders resting against a\ntree hole. He tried to count the number of days and nights lying behind\nhim now since that early morning when he had watched the Terran camp die\nunder the aliens' weapons. But one day faded into another so that he\ncould remember only action parts clearly--the attack on the grounded\nscoutship, the sortie they had made in turn on the occupied camp, the\ndust storm on the river, the escape from the Throg ship in the mountain\ncrevice, and their meeting with the hound. Then that storm which had\ndriven them to seek cover after their curious experience with the disk.\nAnd now this day when they had safely reached the island.\n\n\"Why this island?\" he asked suddenly.\n\n\"That carved piece was found here on the edge of this valley,\" Thorvald\nreturned matter-of-factly.\n\n\"But today we found nothing at all----\"\n\n\"Yet this island supplies us with a starting point.\"\n\nA starting point for what? A detailed search of all the islands, great\nand small, in the chain? And how did they dare continue to paddle openly\nfrom one to the next with the Throgs sweeping the skies? They would have\nprovided an excellent target today as they combed that reef for an hour\nor more. Wearily, Shann spread out his hands in the very faint light of\ntheir tiny fire, poked with a finger tip at smarting points which would\nhave been blisters had those hands not known a toughening process in the\npast. More paddling tomorrow? But that was tomorrow, and at least they\nneed not worry tonight about any Throg attack once they had doused the\nfire, an action which was now being methodically attended to by\nThorvald. Shann pushed down on the bed of leaves he had heaped together.\nThe night was quiet. He could hear only the murmur of the sea, a lulling\ncroon of sound to make one sleep deep, perhaps dreamlessly.\n\nSun struck down, making a dazzle about him. Shann turned over drowsily\nin that welcome heat, stretching a little as might a cat at ease. Then\nhe really awoke under the press of memory, and the need for alertness\nrode him once more. Beaten-down grass, the burnt-out embers of last\nnight's fire were beside him. But of Thorvald and the wolverines there\nwere no signs.\n\nNot only did he now lie alone, but he was possessed by the feeling that\nhe had not been deserted only momentarily, that Taggi, Togi and the\nSurvey officer were indeed gone. Shann sat up, got to his feet,\nbreathing faster, a prickle of uneasiness spreading in him, bringing him\nto that inner slope, up it to the crest from which he could see that\nbeach where last night they had concealed the canoe.\n\nThose lengths of brush and tufts of grass they had used for a screen\nwere strewn about as if tossed in haste. And not too long before....\n\nFor the canoe was out in the calm waters within the reef, the paddle\nblade wielded by its occupant flashing brightly in the sun. On the\nshingle below, the wolverines prowled back and forth, whining in\nbewilderment.\n\n\"Thorvald----!\"\n\nShann put the full force of his lungs into that hail, hearing the name\nring from one of the small peaks at his back. But the man in the boat\ndid not turn his head; there was no change in the speed of that paddle\ndip.\n\nShann leaped down the outer slope to the beach, skidding the last few\nfeet, saving himself from going headfirst into the water only by a\npainful wrench of his body.\n\n\"Thorvald!\" He tried calling again. But that head, bright under the sun\ndid not turn; there was no answer. Shann tore at his clothes and kicked\noff his boots.\n\nHe did not think of the possibility of lurking sea monsters as he\nplunged into the water, swam for the canoe edging along the reef,\nplainly bound for the sea gate to the southwest. Shann was not a\npowerful swimmer. His first impetus gave him a good start, but after\nthat he had to fight for each foot he gained, and the fear grew in him\nthat the other would reach the reef passage before he could catch up. He\nwasted no more time trying to hail Thorvald, putting all his breath and\nenergy into the effort of overtaking the craft.\n\nAnd he almost made it, his hand actually slipping along the log which\nfurnished the balancing outrigger. As his fingers tightened on the slimy\nwood he looked up, and loosed that hold again in time perhaps to save\nhis life.\n\nFor when he ducked to let the water cover his head in an impromptu half\ndive, Shann carried with him a vivid picture, a picture so astounding\nthat he was a little dazed.\n\nThorvald had stopped paddling at last, because that paddle had to be put\nto another use. Had Shann not released his hold on the log and gone\nunder water, that crudely fashioned piece of wood might, have broken his\nskull. He saw only too clearly the paddle raised in both hands as an\nugly weapon, and Thorvald's face, convulsed in a spasm of rage which\nmade it as inhuman as a Throg's.\n\nSputtering and choking, Shann fought up to the air once more. The paddle\nwas back at the task for which it had been carved, the canoe was\nunderway again, its occupant paying no more attention to what lay behind\nthan if he _had_ successfully disposed of the man in the water. To\nfollow would be only to invite another attack, and Shann might not be so\nlucky next time. He was not good enough a swimmer to try any tricks such\nas oversetting the canoe, not when Thorvald was an expert who could\neasily finish off a fumbling opponent.\n\nShann swam wearily to shore where the wolverines waited, unable yet to\nmake sense of that attack in the lagoon. What had happened to Thorvald?\nWhat motive had led the other to leave Shann and the animals on this\nisland, the island Thorvald had called a starting point in his search\nfor the natives of Warlock? Or had every bit of that tall tale been\ninvented by the Survey officer for some obscure purpose of his own,\ncertainly no sane purpose? Against that logic Shann could only set the\ncarved disk, and he had only Thorvald's word that that had been\ndiscovered here.\n\nHe dragged himself out of the water on his hands and knees and lay,\nwinded and gasping. Taggi came to lick his face, nuzzle him, making a\nsmall, bewildered whimpering. While above, the leather-headed birds\ncalled and swooped, fearful and angry for their disturbed nesting place.\nThe Terran retched, coughed up water, and then sat up to look around.\n\nThe spread of lagoon was bare. Thorvald must have rounded the south\npoint of land and be very close to the reef passage, perhaps through it\nby now. Not stopping for his clothes, Shann started up the slope,\ncrawling part of the way on his hands and knees.\n\nHe reached the crest again and got to his feet. The sun made an\neye-dazzling glitter of the waves. But under the shade of his hands\nShann saw the canoe again, beyond the reef, heading on out along the\nisland chain, not back to shore as he had expected. Thorvald was still\non the hunt, but for what? A reality which existed, or a dream in his\nown disturbed brain?\n\nShann sat down. He was very hungry, for that adventure in the lagoon had\nsapped his strength. And he was a prisoner along with the wolverines, a\nprisoner on an island which was half the size of the valley which held\nthe Survey camp. As far as he knew, his only supply of drinkable water\nwas that tank of evil-smelling rain which would be speedily evaporated\nby a sun such as the one now beating down on him. And between him and\nthe shore was the sea, a sea which harbored such creatures as the\nfork-tail he had watched die.\n\nThorvald was still steadily on course, not to the next island in the\nchain, a small, bare knob, but to the one beyond that. He could have\nbeen hurrying to a meeting. Where and with what?\n\nShann got to his feet, started down to the beach once more, sure now\nthat the officer had no intention of returning, that he was again on his\nown with only his wits and strength to keep him alive--alive and somehow\nfree of this water-washed prison.\n\n\n\n\n10. A TRAP FOR A TRAPPER\n\n\nShann took up the piece of soft chalklike stone he had found and drew\nanother short white mark on the rust-red of a boulder well above tide\nlevel. That made three such marks, three days since Thorvald had\nmarooned him. And he was no nearer the shore now than he had been on\nthat first morning! He sat where he was by the boulder, aware that he\nshould be up, trying to climb to the less accessible nests of the sea\nbirds. The prisoners, man and wolverines, had cleaned out all those they\nhad discovered on beach and cliffs. But at the thought of more eggs,\nShann's stomach knotted in pain and he began to retch.\n\nThere had been no sign of Thorvald since Shann had watched him steer\nbetween the two westward islands. And the younger Terran's faint hope\nthat the officer would return had died. On the shore a few feet away lay\nhis own pitiful attempt to solve the problem of escape.\n\nThe force ax had vanished with Thorvald, along with all the rest of the\nmeager supplies which had been the officer's original contribution to\ntheir joint equipment. Shann had used his knife on brush and small\ntrees, trying to put together some kind of a raft. But he had not been\nable to discover here any of those vines necessary for binding, and his\nbest efforts had all come to grief when he tried them in a lagoon\nlaunching. So far he had achieved no form of raft which would keep him\nafloat longer than five minutes, let alone support three of them as far\nas the next island.\n\nShann pulled listlessly at the framework of his latest try, fully\ndisheartened. He tried not to think of the unescapable fact that the\nwater in the rain tank had sunk to only an inch or so of muddy scum.\nLast night he had dug in the heart of the interior valley where the\nrankness of the vegetation was a promise of moisture, to uncover damp\nclay and then a brackish ooze. Far too little to satisfy both him and\nthe animals.\n\nThere were surely fish somewhere in the lagoon. Shann wondered if the\nraw flesh of sea dwellers could supply the water they needed. But\nlacking net, line, or hooks, how did one fish? Yesterday, using his\nstunner, he had brought down a bird, to discover the carcass so rank\neven the wolverines, never dainty eaters, refused to gnaw it.\n\nThe animals prowled the two beaches, and Shann guessed they hunted shell\ndwellers, for at times they dug energetically in the gravel. Togi was\nbusied in this way now, the sand flowing from under her pumping legs,\nher claws raking in good earnest.\n\nAnd it was Togi's excavation which brought Shann a first ray of hope.\nHer excitement was so marked that he believed she was in quest of some\nworthwhile game and he moved across to inspect the pit. A patch of\nbrown, which had been skimmed bare by one raking paw, made him shout.\n\nTaggi shambled downslope, going to work beside his mate with an\neagerness as open as hers. Shann hovered at the edge of the pit they\nwere rapidly enlarging. The brown patch was larger, disclosing itself as\na hump doming up from the gravel. The Terran did not need to run his\nhands over that rough surface to recognize the nature of the find. This\nwas another shell such as had come floating in after the storm to form\nthe raw material of their canoe.\n\nHowever, as fast as the wolverines dug, they did not appear to make\ncorrespondingly swift headway in uncovering their find as might\nreasonably be expected. In fact, a witness could guess that the shell\nwas sinking at a pace only a fraction slower than the burrowers were\nusing to free it. Intrigued by that, Shann went back to the waterline,\nsecured one of the lengths he had been trying to weave into his\nfailures, and returned to use it as a makeshift shovel.\n\nNow, with three of them at the digging, the brown hump was uncovered,\nand Shann pried down around its edge, trying to lever it up and over. To\nhis amazement, his tool was caught and held, nearly jerked from his\nhands. To his retaliating tug the obstruction below-ground gave way, and\nthe Terran sprawled back, the length of wood coming clear, to show the\nother end smashed and splintered as if it had been caught between\nmashing gears.\n\nFor the first time he understood that they were dealing not with an\nempty shell casing buried by drift under this small beach, but with a\nshell still inhabited by the Warlockian to whom it was a natural\ncovering, and that that inhabitant would fight to continue ownership. A\nmoment's examination of that splintered wood also suggested that the\nshell's present wearer appeared well able to defend itself.\n\nShann attempted to call off the wolverines, but they were out of control\nnow, digging frantically to get at this new prey. And he knew that if he\npulled them away by force, they were apt to turn those punishing claws\nand snapping jaws on him.\n\nIt was for their protection that he returned to digging, though he no\nlonger tried to pry up the shell. Taggi leaped to the top of that dome,\nsweeping paws downward to clear its surface, while Togi prowled around\nits circumference, pausing now and then to send dirt and gravel\nspattering, but treading warily as might one alert for a sudden attack.\n\nThey had the creature almost clear now, though the shell still rested\nfirmly on the ground, and they had no notion of what it might protect.\nIt was smaller, perhaps two thirds the size of the one which Thorvald\nhad fashioned into a seagoing craft. But it could provide them with\ntransportation to the mainland if Shann was able to repeat the feat of\nturning it into an outrigger canoe.\n\nTaggi joined his mate on the ground and both wolverines padded about the\ndome, obviously baffled. Now and then they assaulted the shell with a\ntesting paw. Claws raked and did not leave any marks but shallow\nscratches. They could continue that forever, as far as Shann could see,\nwithout solving the problem in the least.\n\nHe sat back on his heels and studied the scene in detail. The excavation\nholding the shelled creature was some three yards above the high-water\nmark, with a few more feet separating that from the point where lazy\nwaves now washed the finer sand. Shann watched the slow inward slip of\nthose waves with growing interest. Where their combined efforts had\nfailed to win this odd battle, perhaps the sea itself could now be\npressed into service.\n\nShann began his own excavation, a trough to lead from the waterline to\nthe pit occupied by the obstinate shell. Of course the thing living in\nor under that covering might be only too familiar with salt water. But\nit had placed its burrow, or hiding place, above the reach of the waves\nand so might be disconcerted by the sudden appearance of water in its\nbed. However, the scheme was worth trying, and he went to work doggedly,\nwishing he could make the wolverines understand so they would help him.\n\nThey still prowled about their captive, scrapping at the sand about the\nshell casing. At least their efforts would keep the half-prisoner\noccupied and prevent its escape. Shann put another piece of his raft to\nwork as a shovel, throwing up a shower of sand and gravel while sweat\ndampened his tattered blouse and was salt and sticky on his arms and\nface.\n\nHe finished his trench, one which ran at an angle he hoped would feed\nwater into the pit rapidly once he knocked away the last barrier against\nthe waves. And, splashing out into the green water, he did just that.\n\nHis calculations proved correct. Waves lapped, then flowed in a rapidly\nthickening stream, puddling out about the shell as the wolverines drew\nback, snarling. Shann lashed his knife fast to a stout length of\nsapling, so equipping himself with a spear. He stood with it ready in\nhis hand, not knowing just what to expect. And when the answer to his\nwater attack came, the move was so sudden that in spite of his\npreparation he was caught gaping.\n\nFor the shell fairly erupted out of the mess of sand and water. A\ncomplete fringe of jointed, clawed brown limbs churned in a\nforward-and-upward dash. But the water worked to frustrate that charge.\nFor one of the pit walls crumbled, over-balancing the creature so that\nthe fore end of the shell lifted from the ground, the legs clawing\nwildly at the air.\n\nShann thrust with the spear, feeling the knife point go home so deeply\nthat he could not pull his improvised weapon free. A limb snapped claws\nonly inches away from his leg as he pushed down on the haft with all his\nstrength. That attack along with the initial upset of balance did the\njob. The shell flopped over, its rounded hump now embedded in the watery\nsand of the pit while the frantic struggles of the creature to right\nitself only buried it the deeper.\n\nThe Terran stared down upon a segmented under belly where legs were\npaired in riblike formation. Shann could locate no head, no good target.\nBut he drew his stunner and beamed at either end of the oval, and then,\nfor good measure, in the middle, hoping in one of those three general\nblasts to contact the thing's central nervous system. He was not to know\nwhich of those shots did the trick, but the frantic wiggling of the legs\nslowed and finally ended, as a clockwork toy might run down for want of\nwinding--and at last projected, at crooked angles, completely still. The\nshell creature might not be dead, but it was tamed for now.\n\nTaggi had only been waiting for a good chance to do battle. He grabbed\none of those legs, worried it, and then leaped to tear at the under\nbody. Unlike the outer shell, this portion of the creature had no proper\narmor and the wolverine plunged joyfully into the business of the kill,\nhis mate following suit.\n\nThe process of butchery was a bloody, even beastly job, and Shann was\nshaken before it was complete. But he kept at his labors, determined to\nhave that shell, his one chance of escape from the Island. The\nwolverines feasted on the greenish-white flesh, but he could not bring\nhimself to sample it, climbing to the heights in search of eggs, and\nmaking a happy find of a niche filled with the edible moss-fungi.\n\nBy late afternoon he had the shell scooped fairly clean and the\nwolverines had carried away for burial such portions as they had not\nbeen able to consume at their first eating. Meanwhile, the\nleather-headed birds had grown bold enough to snatch up the fragments he\ntossed out on the water, struggling for that bounty against feeders\narising from the depths of the lagoon.\n\nAt the coming of dusk Shann hauled the bloodstained, grisly trophy well\nup the beach and wedged it among the rocks, determined not to lose his\ntreasure. Then he stripped and washed, first his clothing and then\nhimself, rubbing his hands and arms with sand until his skin was tender.\nHe was still exultant at his luck. The drift would supply him with\nmaterials for an outrigger. One more day's work--or maybe two--and he\ncould leave. He wrung out his blouse and gazed toward the distant line\nof the shore. Once he had his new canoe ready he would try to make the\ntrip back in the early morning while the mists were still on the sea.\nThat should give him cover against any Throg flight.\n\nThat night Shann slept in the deep fog of bodily exhaustion. There were\nno dreams, nothing but an unconsciousness which even a Throg attack\ncould not have pierced. He roused in the morning with an odd feeling of\nguilt. The water hole he had scooped in the valley yielded him some\nswallows tasting of earth, but he had almost forgotten the flavor of a\npurer liquid. Munching on a fistful of moss, he hurried down to the\nshore, half fearing to find the shell gone, his luck out once again.\n\nNot only was the shell where he had wedged it, but he had done better\nthan he knew when he had left it exposed in the night. Small things\nscuttled away from it into hiding, and several birds arose--scavengers\nhad been busy lightening his unwelcome task for that morning. And\nseeing how the clean-up process had gone, Shann had a second\ninspiration.\n\nPushing the thing down the beach, he sank it in the shallows with\nseveral rocks to anchor it. Within a few seconds the shell was invaded\nby a whole school of spiny-tailed fish, that ate greedily. Leaving his\nfind to their cleansing, Shann went back to prospect the pile of raft\nmaterial, choosing pieces which could serve for an outrigger frame. He\nwas handicapped as he had been all along by the absence of the vines one\ncould use for lashings. And he had reached the point of considering a\ndrastic sacrifice of his clothing to get the necessary strips when he\nsaw Taggi dragging behind him one of the jointed legs the wolverines had\nput in storage the day before.\n\nNow and again Taggi laid his prize on the shingle, holding it firmly\npinned with his forepaws as he tried to worry loose a section of flesh.\nBut apparently that feat was beyond even his notable teeth, and at\nlength he left it lying there in disgust while he returned to a cache\nfor more palatable fare. Shann went to examine more closely the\ntriple-jointed limb.\n\nThe casing was not as hard as horn or shell, he discovered upon testing;\nit more resembled tough skin laid over bone. With a knife he tried to\nloosen the skin--a tedious job requiring a great deal of patience, since\nthe tissue tore if pulled away too fast. But with care he acquired a few\nthongs perhaps a foot long. Using two of these, he made a trial binding\nof one stick to another, and experimented farther, soaking the whole\nconstruction in sea water and then exposing it to the direct rays of the\nsun.\n\nWhen he examined his test piece an hour later, the skin thongs had set\ninto place with such success that the one piece of wood might have been\nfirmly glued to the other. Shann shuffled his feet in a little dance of\ntriumph as he went on to the lagoon to inspect the water-logged shell.\nThe scavengers had done well. One scraping, two at the most, would have\nthe whole thing clean and ready to use.\n\nBut that night Shann dreamed. No climbing of a skull-shaped mountain\nthis time. Instead, he was again on the beach, laboring under an\noverwhelming compulsion, building something for an alien purpose he\ncould not understand. And he worked as hopelessly as a beaten slave,\nknowing that what he made was to his own undoing. Yet he could not halt\nthe making, because just beyond the limit of his vision there stood a\ndominant will which held him in bondage.\n\nAnd he awoke on the beach in the very early dawn, not knowing how he had\ncome there. His body was bathed in sweat, as it had been during his\nday's labors under the sun, and his muscles ached with fatigue.\n\nBut when he saw what lay at his feet he cringed. The framework\nof the outrigger, close to completion the night before, was\ndismantled--smashed. All those strips of hide he had so laboriously\nculled were cut--into inch-long bits which could be of no service.\n\nShann whirled, ran to the shell he had the night before pulled from the\nwater and stowed in safety. Its rounded dome was dulled where it had\nbeen battered, but there was no break in the surface. He ran his hands\nanxiously over the curve to make sure. Then, very slowly, he came back\nto the mess of broken wood and snipped hide. And he was sure, only too\nsure, of one thing. He, himself, had wrought that destruction. In his\ndream he had built to satisfy the whim of an enemy; in reality he had\ndestroyed; and that was also, he believed, to satisfy an enemy.\n\nThe dream was a part of it. But who or what could set a man dreaming and\nso take over his body, make him in fact betray himself? But then, what\nhad made Thorvald maroon him here? For the first time, Shann guessed a\nnew, if wild, explanation for the officer's desertion. Dreams--and the\ndisk which had worked so strangely on Thorvald. Suppose everything the\nother had surmised was the truth! Then that disk _had_ been found on\nthis very island, and here somewhere must lie a clue to the riddle.\n\nShann licked his lips. Suppose that Thorvald had been sent away under\njust such a strong compulsion as the one which had ruled Shann last\nnight? Why was he left behind if the other had been moved away to\nprotect some secret? Was it that Shann himself was wanted here, wanted\nso much that when he at last found a means of escape he was set to\ndestroy it? That act might have been forced upon him for two reasons: to\nkeep him here, and to impress upon him how powerless he was.\n\nPowerless! A flicker of stubborn will stirred to respond to that implied\nchallenge. All right, the mysterious _they_ had made him do this. But\nthey had underrated him by letting him learn, almost contemptuously, of\ntheir presence by that revelation. So warned, he was in a manner armed;\nhe could prepare to fight back.\n\nHe squatted by the wreckage as he thought that through, turning over\nbroken pieces. And, Shann realized, he must present at the moment a\nsatisfactory picture of despondency to any spy. A spy, that was it!\nSomeone or something must have him under observation, or his activities\nof the day before would not have been so summarily countered. And if\nthere was a spy, then there was his answer to the riddle. To trap the\ntrapper. Such action might be a project beyond his resources, but it was\nhis own counterattack.\n\nSo now he had to play a role. Not only must he search the island for the\ntrace of his spy, but he must do it in such a fashion that his purpose\nwould not be plain to the enemy he suspected. The wolverines could help.\nShann arose, allowed his shoulders to droop, slouching to the slope with\nall the air of a beaten man which he could assume, whistling for Taggi\nand Togi.\n\nWhen they came, his exploration began. Ostensibly he was hunting for\nlengths of drift or suitable growing saplings to take the place of those\nhe had destroyed under orders. But he kept a careful watch on the animal\npair, hoping by their reactions to pick up a clue to any hidden watcher.\n\nThe larger of the two beaches marked the point where the Terrans had\nfirst landed and where the shell thing had been killed. The smaller was\nmore of a narrow tongue thrust out into the lagoon, much of it choked\nwith sizable boulders. On earlier visits there Taggi and Togi had poked\ninto the hollows among these with their usual curiosity. But now both\nanimals remained upslope, showing no inclination to descend to the water\nline.\n\nShann caught hold of Taggi's scruff, pulling him along. The wolverine\ntwisted and whined, but he did not fight for freedom as he would have\nupon scenting Throg. Not that the Terran had ever believed one of those\naliens was responsible for the happenings on the island.\n\nTaggi came down under Shann's urging, but he was plainly ill at ease.\nAnd at last he snarled a warning when the man would have drawn him\ncloser to two rocks which met overhead in a crude semblance of an arch.\nThere was a stick of drift protruding from that hollow affording Shann a\nlegitimate excuse to venture closer. He dropped his hold on the\nwolverines, stooped to gather in the length of wood, and at the same\ntime glanced into the pocket.\n\nWater lay just beyond, making this a doorway to the lagoon. The sun had\nnot yet penetrated into the shadow, if it ever did. Shann reached for\nthe wood, at the same time drawing his finger across the flat rock which\nwould furnish a steppingstone for anything using that door as an\nentrance to the island.\n\nWet! Which might mean his visitor had recently arrived, or else merely\nthat a splotch of spray had landed there not too long before. But in his\nmind Shann was convinced that he had found the spy's entrance. Could he\nturn it into a trap? He added a piece of drift to his bundle and picked\nup two more before he returned to the cliff ahead.\n\nA trap.... He revolved in his mind all the traps he knew which could be\nused here. He already had decided upon the bait--his own work. And if\nhis plans went through--and hope does not die easily--then this time he\nwould not waste his labor either.\n\nSo he went back to the same job he had done the day before, making do\nwith skin strips he had considered second-best before, smoothing,\ncutting. Only the trap occupied his mind, and close to sunset he knew\njust what he was going to do and how.\n\nThough the Terran did not know the nature of the unseen opponent, he\nthought he could guess two weaknesses which might deliver the other into\nhis hands. First, the enemy was entirely confident of success in this\nventure. No being who was able to control Shann as completely and ably\nas had been done the night before would credit any prey with the power\nto strike back in force.\n\nSecond, such a confident enemy would be unable to resist watching the\nmanipulation of a captive. The Terran was certain that his opponent\nwould be on the scene somewhere when he was led, dreaming, to destroy\nhis work once more.\n\nHe might be wrong on both of those counts, but inwardly he didn't\nbelieve so. However, he had to wait until the dark to set up his own\nanswer, one so simple he was certain the enemy would not suspect it at\nall.\n\n\n\n\n11. THE WITCH\n\n\nThere were patches of light in the inner valley marking the\nphosphorescent plants, some creeping at ground level, others tall as\nsaplings. On other nights Shann had welcomed that wan radiance, but now\nhe lay in as relaxed a position as possible, marking each of those\npotential betrayers as he tried to counterfeit the attitude of sleep and\nat the same time plan out his route.\n\nHe had purposely settled in a pool of shadow, the wolverines beside him.\nAnd he thought that the bulk of the animal's bodies would cover his own\nwithdrawal when the time came to move. One arm lying limply across his\nmiddle was in reality clutching to him an intricate arrangement of small\nhide straps which he had made by sacrificing most of the remainder of\nhis painfully acquired thongs. The trap must be set in place soon!\n\nNow that he had charted a path to the crucial point avoiding all light\nplants, Shann was ready to move. The Terran pressed his hand on Taggi's\nhead in the one imperative command the wolverine was apt to obey--the\norder to stay where he was.\n\nShann sat up and gave the same voiceless instruction to Togi. Then he\ninched out of the hollow, a worm's progress to that narrow way along the\ncliff top--the path which anyone or anything coming up from that sea\ngate on the beach would have to pass in order to witness the shoreline\noccupied by the half-built outrigger.\n\nSo much of his plan was based upon luck and guesses, but those were all\nShann had. And as he worked at the stretching of his snare, the Terran's\nheart pounded, and he tensed at every sound out of the night. Having\ntested all the anchoring of his net, he tugged at a last knot, and then\ncrouched to listen not only with his ears, but with all his strength of\nmind and body.\n\nPound of waves, whistle of wind, the sleepy complaint of some bird.... A\nregular splashing! One of the fish in the lagoon? Or what he awaited?\nThe Terran retreated as noiselessly as he had come, heading for the\nhollow where he had bedded down.\n\nHe reached there breathless, his heart pumping, his mouth dry as if he\nhad been racing. Taggi stirred and thrust a nose inquiringly against\nShann's arm. But the wolverine made no sound, as if he, too, realized\nthat some menace lay beyond the rim of the valley. Would that other come\nup the path Shann had trapped? Or had he been wrong? Was the enemy\nalready stalking him from the other beach? The grip of his stunner was\nslippery in his damp hand; he hated this waiting.\n\nThe canoe ... his work on it had been a careless botching. Better to\nhave the job done right. Why, it was perfectly clear now how he had been\nmistaken! His whole work plan was wrong; he could see the right way of\ndoing things laid out as clear as a blueprint in his mind. A picture in\nhis mind!\n\nShann stood up and both wolverines moved uneasily, though neither made a\nsound. A picture in his mind! But this time he wasn't asleep; he wasn't\ndreaming a dream--to be used for his own defeat. Only (that other could\nnot know this) the pressure which had planted the idea of new work to be\ndone in his mind--an idea one part of him accepted as fact--had not\ntaken warning from his move. He was supposed to be under control; the\nTerran was sure of that. All right, so he would play that part. He must\nif he would entice the trapper into his trap.\n\nHe holstered his stunner, walked out into the open, paying no heed now\nto the patches of light through which he must pass on his way to the\npath his own feet had already worn to the boat beach. As he went, Shann\ntried to counterfeit what he believed would be the gait of a man under\ncompulsion.\n\nNow he was on the rim fronting the downslope, fighting against his\ndesire to turn and see for himself if anything had climbed behind. The\ncanoe was all wrong, a bad job which he must make better at once so that\nin the morning he would be free of this island prison.\n\nThe pressure of that other's will grew stronger. And the Terran read\ninto that the overconfidence which he believed would be part of the\nenemy's character. The one who was sending him to destroy his own work\nhad no suspicion that the victim was not entirely malleable, ready to be\nused as he himself would use a knife or a force ax. Shann strode\nsteadily downslope. With a small spurt of fear he knew that in a way\nthat unseen other was right; the pressure was taking over, even though\nhe was awake this time. The Terran tried to will his hand to his\nstunner, but his fingers fell instead on the hilt of his knife. He drew\nthe blade as panic seethed in his head, chilling him from within. He had\nunderestimated the other's power....\n\nAnd that panic flared into open fight, making him forget his careful\nplans. Now he _must_ wrench free from this control. The knife was moving\nto slash a hide lashing, directed by his hand, but not his will.\n\nA soundless gasp, a flash of dismay rocked him, but neither was his gasp\nnor his dismay. That pressure snapped off; he was free. But the other\nwasn't! Knife still in fist, Shann turned and ran upslope, his torch in\nhis other hand. He could see a shape now writhing, fighting, outlined\nagainst a light bush. And, fearing that the stranger might win free and\ndisappear, the Terran spotlighted the captive in the beam, reckless of\nThrog or enemy reinforcements.\n\nThe other crouched, plainly startled by the sudden burst of light. Shann\nstopped abruptly. He had not really built up any mental picture of what\nhe had expected to find in his snare, but this prisoner was as weirdly\nalien to him as a Throg. The light on the torch was reflected off a\nskin which glittered as if scaled, glittered with the brilliance of\njewels in bands and coils of color spreading from the throat down the\nchest, spiraling about upper arms, around waist and thighs, as if the\nstranger wore a treasure house of gems as part of a living body. Except\nfor those patterned loops, coils, and bands, the body had no clothing,\nthough a belt about the slender middle supported a pair of pouches and\nsome odd implements held in loops.\n\nRoughly the figure was more humanoid than the Throgs. The upper limbs\nwere not too unlike Shann's arms, though the hands had four digits of\nequal length instead of five. But the features were nonhuman, closer to\nsaurian in contour. It had large eyes, blazing yellow in the dazzle of\nthe flash, with vertical slits of green for pupils. A nose united with\nthe jaw to make a snout, and above the domed forehead a sharp V-point of\nraised spiky growth extended back and down until behind the shoulder\nblades it widened and expanded to resemble a pair of wings.\n\nThe captive no longer struggled, but sat quietly in the tangle of the\nsnare Shann had set, watching the Terran steadily as if there were no\ndifficulty in seeing through the brilliance of the beam to the man who\nheld it. And, oddly enough, Shann experienced no repulsion toward its\nreptilian appearance as he had upon first sighting the beetle-Throg. On\nimpulse he put down his torch on a rock and walked into the light to\nface squarely the thing out of the sea.\n\nStill eying Shann, the captive raised one limb and gave an absent-minded\ntug to the belt it wore. Shann, noting that gesture, was struck by a\nwild surmise, leading him to study the prisoner more narrowly. Allowing\nfor the alien structure of bone, the nonhuman skin; this creature was\ndelicate, graceful, in its way beautiful, with a fragility of limb which\nbacked up his suspicions. Moved by no pressure from the other, but by\nhis own will and sense of fitness, Shann stooped to cut the control line\nof his snare.\n\nThe captive continued to watch as Shann sheathed his blade and then\nheld out his hand. Yellow eyes, never blinking since his initial\nappearance, regarded him, not with any trace of fear or dismay, but with\na calm measurement which was curiosity based upon a strong belief in its\nown superiority. He did not know how he knew, but Shann was certain that\nthe creature out of the sea was still entirely confident, that it made\nno fight because it did not conceive of any possible danger from him.\nAnd again, oddly enough, he was not irritated by this unconscious\narrogance; rather he was intrigued and amused.\n\n\"Friends?\" Shann used the basic galactic speech devised by Survey and\nthe Free Traders, semantics which depended upon the proper inflection of\nvoice and tone to project meaning when the words were foreign.\n\nThe other made no sound, and the Terran began to wonder if his captive\nhad any audible form of speech. He withdrew a step or two then pulled at\nthe snare, drawing the cords away from the creature's slender ankles.\nRolling the thongs into a ball, he tossed the crude net back over his\nshoulder.\n\n\"Friends?\" he repeated again, showing his empty hands, trying to give\nthat one word the proper inflection, hoping the other could read his\npeaceful intent in his features if not by his speech.\n\nIn one lithe, flowing movement the alien arose. Fully erect, the\nWarlockian had a frail appearance. Shann, for his breed, was not tall.\nBut the native was still smaller, not more than five feet, that stiff V\nof head crest just topping Shann's shoulder. Whether any of those\nfittings at its belt could be a weapon the Terran had no way of telling.\nHowever, the other made no move to draw any of them.\n\nInstead, one of the four-digit hands came up. Shann felt the feather\ntouch of strange finger tips on his chin, across his lips, up his cheek,\nto at last press firmly on his forehead at a spot just between the\neyebrows. What followed was communication of a sort, not in words or in\nany describable flow of thoughts. There was no feeling of enmity--at\nleast nothing strong enough to be called that. Curiosity, yes, and then\na growing doubt, not of the Terran himself, but of the other's\npreconceived ideas concerning him. Shann was other than the native had\njudged him, and the stranger was disturbed, that self-confidence a\nlittle ruffled. And also Shann was right in his guess. He smiled, his\namusement growing--not aimed at his companion on this cliff top, but at\nhimself. For he was dealing with a woman, a very young woman, and\nsomeone as fully feminine in her way as any human girl could be.\n\n\"Friends?\" he asked for the third time.\n\nBut the other still exuded a wariness, a wariness mixed with surprise.\nAnd the tenuous message which passed between them then astounded Shann.\nTo this Warlockian out of the night he was not following the proper\npattern of male behaviour at all; he should have been in awe of the\nother merely because of her sex. A diffidence rather than an assumption\nof equality should have colored his response, judged by her standards.\nAt first, he caught a flash of anger at this preposterous attitude of\nhis; then her curiosity won, but there was still no reply to his\nquestion.\n\nThe finger tips no longer made contact between them. Stepping back, her\nhands now reached for one of the pouches at her belt. Shann watched that\nmovement carefully. And because he did not trust her too far, he\nwhistled.\n\nHer head came up. She might be dumb, but plainly she was not deaf. And\nshe gazed down into the hollow as the wolverines answered his summons\nwith growls. Her profile reminded Shann of something for an instant; but\nit should have been golden-yellow instead of silver with two jeweled\npatterns ringing the snout. Yes, that small plaque he had seen in the\ncabin of one of the ship's officers. A very old Terran legend--\"Dragon,\"\nthe officer had named the creature. Only that one had possessed a\nserpent's body, a lizard's legs and wings.\n\nShann gave a sudden start, aware his thoughts had made him careless, or\nhad she in some way led him into that bypath of memory for her own\npurposes? Because now she held some object in the curve of her curled\nfingers, regarding him with those unblinking yellow eyes. Eyes ...\neyes.... Shann dimly heard the alarm cry of the wolverines. He tried to\nsnap draw his stunner, but it was too late.\n\nThere was a haze about him hiding the rocks, the island valley with its\nradiant plants, the night sky, the bright beam of the torch. Now he\nmoved through that haze as one walks through a dream approaching\nnightmare, striding with an effort as if wading through a deterring\nflood. Sound, sight--one after another those senses were taken from him.\nDesperately Shann held to one thing, his own sense of identity. He was\nShann Lantee, Terran breed, out of Tyr, of the Survey Service. Some part\nof him repeated those facts with vast urgency against an almost\noverwhelming force which strove to defeat that awareness of self, making\nhim nothing but a tool--or a weapon--for another's use.\n\nThe Terran fought, soundlessly but fiercely, on a battleground which was\nwithin him, knowing in a detached way that his body obeyed another's\ncommands.\n\n\"I am Shann--\" he cried without audible speech. \"I am myself. I have two\nhands, two legs.... I think for myself! I am a _man_----\"\n\nAnd to that came an answer of sorts, a blow of will striking at his\nresistance, a will which struggled to drown him before ebbing, leaving\nbehind it a faint suggestion of bewilderment, of a dawn of concern.\n\n\"I am a _man_!\" he hurled that assertion as he might have thrust deep\nwith one of the crude spears he had used against the Throgs. For against\nwhat he faced now his weapons were as crude as spears fronting blasters.\n\"I am Shann Lantee, Terran, man....\" Those were facts; no haze could\nsweep them from his mind or take away that heritage.\n\nAnd again there was the lightening of the pressure, the slight recoil,\nwhich could only be a prelude to another assault upon his last\nstronghold. He clutched his three facts to him as a shield, groping for\nothers which might have afforded a weapon of rebuttal.\n\nDreams, these Warlockians dealt in and through dreams. And the opposite\nof dreams are facts! His name, his breed, his sex--these were facts.\nAnd Warlock itself was a fact. The earth under his boots was a fact. The\nwater which washed around the island was a fact. The air he breathed was\na fact. Flesh, blood, bones--facts, all of them. Now he was a struggling\nidentity imprisoned in a rebel body. But that body was real. He tried to\nfeel it. Blood pumped from his heart, his lungs filled and emptied; he\nstruggled to feel those processes.\n\nWith a terrifying shock, the envelope which had held him vanished. Shann\nwas choking, struggling in water. He flailed out with his arms, kicked\nhis legs. One hand grated painfully against stone. Hardly knowing what\nhe did, but fighting for his life, Shann caught at that rock and drew\nhis head out of water. Coughing and gasping, half drowned, he was weak\nwith the panic of his close brush with death.\n\nFor a long moment he could only cling to the rock which had saved him,\nretching and dazed, as the water washed about his body, a current\ntugging at his trailing legs. There was light of a sort here, patches of\ngreen which glowed with the same subdued light as the bushes of the\nouter world, for he was no longer under the night sky. A rock-roof was\nbut inches over his head; he must be in some cave or tunnel under the\nsurface of the sea. Again a gust of panic shook him as he felt trapped.\n\nThe water continued to pull at Shann, and in his weakened condition it\nwas a temptation to yield to that pull; the more he fought it the more\nhe was exhausted. At last the Terran turned on his back, trying to float\nwith the stream, sure he could no longer battle it.\n\nLuckily those few inches of space above the surface of the water\ncontinued, and he had air to breathe. But the fear of that ending, of\nbeing swept under the surface, chewed at his nerves. And his bodily\ndanger burned away the last of the spell which had held him, brought him\ninto this place, wherever it might be.\n\nWas it only his heightened imagination, or had the current grown\nswifter? Shann tried to gauge the speed of his passage by the way the\npatches of green light slipped by. Now he turned and began to swim\nslowly, feeling as if his arms were leaden weights, his ribs a cage to\nbind his aching lungs.\n\nAnother patch of light ... larger ... spreading across the roof over\nhead. Then, he was out! Out of the tunnel into a cavern so vast that its\narching roof was like a skydome far above his head. But here the patches\nof light were brighter, and they were arranged in odd groups which had a\nfamiliar look to them.\n\nOnly, better than freedom overhead, there was a shore not too distant.\nShann swam for that haven, summoning up the last rags of his strength,\nknowing that if he could not reach it very soon he was finished. Somehow\nhe made it and lay gasping, his cheek resting on sand finer than any of\nthe outer world, his fingers digging into it for purchase to drag his\nbody on. But when he collapsed, his legs were still awash in water.\n\nNo footfall could be heard on that sand. But he knew that he was no\nlonger alone. He braced his hands and with painful effort levered up his\nbody. Somehow he made it to his knees, but he could not stand. Instead\nhe half tumbled back, so that he faced them from a sitting position.\n\n_Them_--there were three of them--the dragon-headed ones with their\nslender, jewel-set bodies glittering even in this subdued light, their\nyellow eyes fastened on him with a remoteness which did not approach any\nhuman emotion, save perhaps that of a cold and limited wonder. But\nbehind them came a fourth, one he knew by the patterns on her body.\n\nShann clasped his hands about his knees to still the trembling of his\nbody, and eyed them back with all the defiance he could muster. Nor did\nhe doubt that he had been brought here, his body as captive to their\nwill, as had been that of their spy or messenger in his crude snare on\nthe island.\n\n\"Well, you have me,\" he said hoarsely. \"Now what?\"\n\nHis words boomed weirdly out over the water, were echoed from the dim\nouter reaches of the cavern. There was no answer. They merely stood\nwatching him. Shann stiffened, determined to hold to his defiance and\nto that identity which he now knew was his weapon against the powers\nthey used.\n\nThe one who had somehow drawn him there moved at last, circling around\nthe other three with a suggestion of diffidence in her manner. Shann\njerked back his head as her hand stretched to touch his face. And then,\nguessing that she sought her peculiar form of communication, he\nsubmitted to her finger tips, though now his skin crawled under that\nlight but firm pressure and he shrank from the contract.\n\nThere were no sensations this time. To his amazement a concrete inquiry\nshaped itself in his brain, as clear as if the question had been asked\naloud: \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Shann....\" he began vocally, and then turned words into thoughts.\n\"Shann Lantee, Terran, man.\" He made his answer the same which had kept\nhim from succumbing to their complete domination.\n\n\"Name--Shann Lantee, man--yes.\" The other accepted those, \"Terran?\" That\nwas a question.\n\nDid these people have any notion of space travel? Could they understand\nthe concept of another world holding intelligent beings?\n\n\"I come from another world....\" He tried to make a clean-cut picture in\nhis mind--a globe in space, a ship blasting free....\n\n\"Look!\" The fingers still rested between his eyebrows, but with her\nother hand the Warlockian was pointing up to the dome of the cavern.\n\nShann followed her order. He studied those patches of light which had\nseemed so vaguely familiar at his first sighting, studying them closely\nto know them for what they were. A star map! A map of the heavens as\nthey could be seen from the outer crust of Warlock.\n\n\"Yes, I come from the stars,\" he answered, booming with his voice.\n\nThe fingers dropped from his forehead; the scaled head swung around to\nexchange glances, which were perhaps some unheard communication with\nthe other three. Then the hand was extended again.\n\n\"Come!\"\n\nFingers fell from his head to his right wrist, closing there with\nsurprising strength; and some of that strength together with a new\nenergy flowed from them into him, so that he found and kept his feet as\nthe other drew him up.\n\n\n\n\n12. THE VEIL OF ILLUSION\n\n\nPerhaps his status was that of a prisoner, but Shann was too tired to\npress for an explanation. He was content to be left alone in the unusual\ncircular, but roofless, room of the structure to which they had brought\nhim. There was a thick mat-like pallet in one corner, short for the\nlength of his body, but softer than any bed he had rested on since he\nhad left the Terran camp before the coming of the Throgs. Above him\nglimmered those patches of light symbolizing the lost stars. He blinked\nat them until they all ran together in bands like the jeweled coils on\nWarlockian bodies; then he slept--dreamlessly.\n\nThe Terran awoke with all his senses alert; some silent alarm might have\ntriggered that instant awareness of himself and his surroundings. There\nhad been no change in the star pattern still overhead; no one had\nentered the round chamber. Shann rolled over on his mat bed, conscious\nthat all his aches had vanished. Just as his mind was clearly active, so\ndid his body also respond effortlessly to his demands. He was not aware\nof any hunger or thirst, though a considerable length of time must have\npassed since he had made his mysteriously contrived exit from the outer\nworld.\n\nIn spite of the humidity of the air, his ragged garments had dried on\nhis body. Shann got to his feet, trying to order the sorry remnants of\nhis uniform, eager to be on the move. Though to where and for what\npurpose he could not have answered.\n\nThe door through which he had entered remained closed, refusing to\nyield to his push. Shann stepped back, eyeing the distance to the top of\nthe partition between the roofless rooms. The walls were smooth with the\ngloss of a sea shell's interior, but the exuberant confidence which had\nbeen with him since his awakening refused to accept such a minor\nobstacle.\n\nHe made two test leaps, both times his fingers striking the wall well\nbelow the top of the partition. Shann gathered himself together as might\na cat and tried the third time, putting into that effort every last\nounce of strength, determination and will. He made it, though his arms\njerked as the weight of his body hung from his hands. Then a scramble, a\nknee hooked over the top, and he was perched on the wall, able to study\nthe rest of the building.\n\nIn shape, the structure was unlike anything he had seen on his home\nworld or reproduced in any of the tri-dee records of Survey accessible\nto him. The rooms were either circular or oval, each separated from the\nnext by a short passage, so that the overall impression was that of ten\nstrings of beads radiating from a central knot of one large chamber, all\nwith the uniform nacre walls and a limited amount of furnishings.\n\nAs he balanced on the narrow perch, Shann could sight no other movement\nin the nearest line of rooms, those connected by corridors with his own.\nHe got to his feet to walk the tightrope of the upper walls toward that\ninner chamber which was the heart of the Warlockian--palace? town?\napartment dwelling? At least it was the only structure on the island,\nfor he could see the outer rim of that smooth soft sand ringing it\nabout. The island itself was curiously symmetrical, a perfect oval, too\nperfect to be a natural outcrop of sand and rock.\n\nThere was no day or night here in the cavern. The light from the roof\npatches remained constantly the same, and that flow was abetted within\nthe building by a soft radiation from the walls. Shann reached the next\nroom in line, hunkering down to see within it. To all appearances the\nchamber was exactly the same as the one he had just left; there were the\nsame unadorned walls, a thick mat bed against the far side, and no\nindication whether it was in use or had not been entered for days.\n\nHe was on the next section of corridor wall when he caught that faint\ntaint in the air, the very familiar scent of wolverines. Now it provided\nShann with a guide as well as a promise of allies.\n\nThe next bead-room gave him what he wanted. Below him Taggi and Togi\npaced back and forth. They had already torn to bits the sleeping mat\nwhich had been the chamber's single furnishing, and their temper was\nnone too certain. As Shann squatted well above their range of vision,\nTaggi reared against the opposite wall, his claws finding no hold on the\nsmooth coating of its surface. They were as competently imprisoned as if\nthey had been dropped into a huge fishbowl, and they were not taking to\nit kindly.\n\nHow had the animals been brought here? Down that water tunnel by the\nsame unknown method he himself had been transported until that almost\ndisastrous awakening in the center of the flood? The Terran did not\ndoubt that the doors of the room were as securely fastened as those of\nhis own further down the corridor. For the moment the wolverines were\nsafe; he could not free them. And he was growing increasingly certain\nthat if he found any of his native jailers, it would be at the center of\nthat wheel of rooms and corridors.\n\nShann made no attempt to attract the animals' attention, but kept on\nalong his tightrope path. He passed two more rooms, both empty, both\ndiffering in no way from those he had already inspected; and then he\ncame to the central chamber, four times as big as any of the rest and\nwith a much brighter wall light.\n\nThe Terran crouched, one hand on the surface of the partition top as an\nadditional balance, the other gripping his stunner. For some reason his\ncaptors had not disarmed him. Perhaps they believed they had no\nnecessity to fear his off-world weapon.\n\n\"Have you grown wings?\"\n\nThe words formed in his brain, bringing with them a sense of calm\namusement to reduce all his bold exploration to the level of a child's\nfirst staggering steps. Shann fought his first answering flare of pure\nirritation. To lose even a fraction of control was to open a door for\nthem. He remained where he was as if he had never \"heard\" that question,\nsurveying the room below with all the impassiveness he could summon.\n\nHere the walls were no smooth barrier, but honeycombed with niches in a\nregular pattern. And in each of the niches rested a polished skull, a\nnonhuman skull. Only the outlines of those ranked bones were familiar;\nfor just so had looked the great purple-red rock where the wheeling\nflyers issued from the eye sockets. A rock island had been fashioned\ninto a skull--by design or nature?\n\nAnd upon closer observation the Terran could see that there was a\ndifference among these ranked skulls, a mutation of coloring from row to\nrow, a softening of outline, perhaps by the wearing of time.\n\nThere was also a table of dull black, rising from the flooring on legs\nwhich were not more than a very few inches high, so that from his\npresent perch the board appeared to rest on the pavement itself. Behind\nthe table in a row, as shopkeepers might await a customer, three of the\nWarlockians, seated cross-legged on mats, their hands folded primly\nbefore them. And at the side a fourth, the one whom he had trapped on\nthe island.\n\nNot one of those spiked heads rose to view him. But they knew that he\nwas there; perhaps they had known the very instant he had left the room\nor cell in which they had shut him. And they were so very sure of\nthemselves.... Once again Shann subdued a spark of anger. That same\npatience with its core of stubborn determination which had brought him\nto Warlock backed his moves now. The Terran swung down, landing lightly\non his feet, facing the three behind the table, towering well over them\nas he stood erect, yet gaining no sense of satisfaction from that merely\nphysical fact.\n\n\"You have come.\" The words sounded as if they might be a part of some\npolite formula. So he replied in kind and aloud.\n\n\"I have come.\" Without waiting for their bidding, he dropped into the\nsame cross-legged pose, fronting them now on a more equal level across\ntheir dead black table.\n\n\"And why have you come, star voyager?\" That thought seemed to be a\nconcentrated effort from all three rather than any individual\nquestioning.\n\n\"And why did you bring me?\" He hesitated, trying to think of some polite\nform of address. Those he knew which were appropriate to their sex on\nother worlds seemed incongruous when applied to the bizarre figures now\nfacing him. \"Wise ones,\" he finally chose.\n\nThose unblinking yellow eyes conveyed no emotion; certainly his human\ngaze could detect no change of expression on their nonhuman faces.\n\n\"You are a male.\"\n\n\"I am,\" he agreed, not seeing just what that fact had to do with either\ndiplomatic fencing or his experiences of the immediate past.\n\n\"Where then is your thoughtguider?\"\n\nShann puzzled over that conception, guessed at its meaning.\n\n\"I am my own thoughtguider,\" he returned stoutly, with all the\nconviction he could manage to put into that reply.\n\nAgain he met a yellow-green stare, but he sensed a change in them. Some\nof their complacency had ebbed; his reply had been as a stone dropped\ninto a quiet pool, sending ripples out afar to disturb the customary\nmirror surface of smooth serenity.\n\n\"The star-born one speaks the truth!\" That came from the Warlockian who\nhad been his first contact.\n\n\"It would appear that he does.\" The agreement was measured, and Shann\nknew that he was meant to \"overhear\" that.\n\n\"It would seem, Readers-of-the-rods\"--the middle one of the triumvirate\nat the table spoke now--\"that all living things do not follow our\npattern of life. But that is possible. A male who thinks for himself ...\nunguided, who dreams perhaps! Or who can understand the truth of\ndreaming! Strange indeed must be his people. Sharers-of-my-visions, let\nus consult the Old Ones concerning this.\" For the first time one of\nthose crested heads moved, the gaze shifted from Shann to the ranks of\nthe skulls, pausing at one.\n\nShann, ready for any wonder, did not betray his amazement when the ivory\ninhabitant of that particular niche moved, lifted from its small\ncompartment, and drifted buoyantly through the air to settle at the\nright-hand corner of the table. Only when it had safely grounded did the\neyes of the Warlockian move to another niche on the other side of the\ncurving room, this time bringing up from close to floor level a\ntime-darkened skull to occupy the left corner of the table.\n\nThere was a third shifting from the weird storehouse, a last skull to\nplace between the other two. And now the youngest native arose from her\nmat to bring a bowl of green crystal. One of her seniors took it in both\nhands, making a gesture of offering it to all three skulls, and then\ngazed over its rim at the Terran.\n\n\"We shall cast the rods, man-who-thinks-without-a-guide. Perhaps then we\nshall see how strong _your_ dreams are--to be bent to your using, or to\nbreak you for your impudence.\"\n\nHer hands swayed the bowl from side to side, and there was an answering\nwhisper from its interior as if the contents slid loosely there. Then\none of her companions reached forward and gave a quick tap to the bottom\nof that container, spilling out upon the table a shower of brightly\ncolored slivers each an inch or so long.\n\nShann, staring at the display in bewilderment, saw that in spite of the\nseeming carelessness of that toss the small needles had spread out on\nthe blank surface to form a design in arrangement and color. And he\nwondered how that skillful trick had been accomplished.\n\nAll three of the Warlockians bent their heads to study the grouping of\nthe tiny sticks, their young subordinate leaning forward also, her\neagerness less well controlled than her elders'. And now it was as if a\ncurtain had fallen between the Terran and the aliens, all sense of\ncommunication which had been with him since he had entered the\nskull-lined chamber was summarily cut off.\n\nA hand moved, making the jeweled pattern--braceleting wrist and\nextending up the arm--flash subdued fire. Fingers swept the sticks back\ninto the bowl; four pairs of yellow eyes raised to regard Shann once\nmore, but the blanket of their withdrawal still held.\n\nThe youngest Warlockian took the bowl from the elder who held it, stood\nfor a long moment with it resting between her palms, fixing Shann with\nan unreadable stare. Then she came toward him. One of those at the table\nput out a restraining hand.\n\nThis time Shann did _not_ master his start as he heard the first audible\nvoice which had not been his own. The skull at the left hand on the\ntable, by its yellowed color the oldest of those summoned from the\nniches, was moving, moving because its jaws gaped and then snapped,\nemitting a faint bleat which might have been a word or two.\n\nShe who would have halted the young Warlockian's advance, withdrew her\nhand. Then her fingers curled in an unmistakable beckoning gesture.\nShann came to the table, but he could not quite force himself near that\nchattering skull, even though it had stopped its jig of speech.\n\nThe bowl of sticks was offered to him. Still no message from mind to\nmind, but he could guess at what they wanted of him. The crystal\nsubstance was not cool to the touch as he had expected; rather it was\nwarm, as living flesh might feel. And the colored sticks filled about\ntwo thirds of the interior, lying all mixed together without any order.\n\nShann concentrated on recalling the ceremony the Warlockian had used\nbefore the first toss. She had offered the bowl to the skulls in turn.\nThe skulls! But he was no consulter of skulls. Still holding the bowl\nclose to his chest, Shann looked up over the roofless walls at the star\nmap on the roof of the cavern. There, that was Rama; and to its left,\njust a little above, was Tyr's system where swung the stark world of his\nbirth, and of which he had only few good memories, but of which he was a\npart. The Terran raised the bowl to that spot of light which marked\nTyr's pale sun.\n\nSmiling with a wry twist, he lowered the bowl, and on impulse of pure\ndefiance he offered it to the skull that had chattered. Immediately he\nrealized that the move had had an electric effect upon the aliens.\nSlowly at first, and then faster, he began to swing the bowl from side\nto side, the needles slipping, mixing within. And as he swung it, Shann\nheld it out over the expanse of the table.\n\nThe Warlockian who had given him the bowl was the one who struck it on\nthe bottom, causing a rain of splinters. To Shann's astonishment, mixed\nas they had been in the container, they once more formed a pattern, and\nnot the same pattern the Warlockians had consulted earlier. The\ndampening curtain between them vanished; he was in touch mind to mind\nonce again.\n\n\"So be it.\" The center Warlockian spread out her four-fingered thumbless\nhands above the scattered needles. \"What is read, is read.\"\n\nAgain a formula. He caught a chorus of answer from the others.\n\n\"What is read, is read. To the dreamer the dream. Let the dream be known\nfor what it is, and there is life. Let the dream encompass the dreamer\nfalsely, and all is lost.\"\n\n\"Who can question the wisdom of the Old Ones?\" asked their leader. \"We\nare those who read the messages they send, out of their mercy. This is a\nstrange thing they bid us do, man--open for you our own initiates' road\nto the veil of illusion. That way has never been for males, who dream\nwithout set purpose and have not the ability to know true from false,\nhave not the courage to face their dreams to the truth. Do so--if you\ncan!\" There was a flash of mockery in that, combined with something\nelse--stronger than distaste, not as strong as hatred, but certainly not\nfriendly.\n\nShe held out her hands and Shann saw now, lying on a slowly closing\npalm, a disk such as the one Thorvald had shown him. The Terran had only\none moment of fear and then came blackness, more absolute than the dark\nof any night he had ever known.\n\nLight once more, green light with an odd shimmering quality to it. The\nskull-lined walls were gone; there were no walls, no building held him.\nShann strode forward, and his boots sank in sand, that smooth, satin\nsand which had ringed the island in the cavern. But he was certain he\nwas no longer on that island, even within that cavern, though far above\nhim there was still a dome of roof.\n\nThe source of the green shimmer lay to his left. Somehow he found\nhimself reluctant to turn and face it. That would commit him to action.\nBut Shann turned.\n\nA veil, a veil of rippling green. Material? No, rather mist or light. A\nveil depending from some source so far over his head that its origin was\nhidden in the upper gloom, a veil which was a barrier he must cross.\n\nWith every nerve protesting, Shann walked forward, unable to keep back.\nHe flung up his arm to protect his face as he marched into that stuff.\nIt was warm, and the gas--if gas it was--left no slick of moisture on\nhis skin in spite of its foggy consistency. And it was no veil or\ncurtain, for although he was already well into the murk, he saw no end\nto it. Blindly he trudged on, unable to sight anything but the rolling\nbillows of green, pausing now and again to go down on one knee and pat\nthe sand underfoot, reassured at the reality of that footing.\n\nAnd when he met nothing menacing, Shann began to relax. His heart no\nlonger labored; he made no move to draw the stunner or knife. Where he\nwas and for what purpose, he had no idea. But there _was_ a purpose in\nthis and that the Warlockians were behind it, he did not doubt. The\n\"initiates' road,\" the leader had said, and the conviction was steady in\nhis mind that he faced some test of alien devising.\n\nA cavern with a green veil--his memory awoke. Thorvald's dream! Shann\npaused, trying to remember how the other had described this place. So he\nwas enacting Thorvald's dream! And could the Survey officer now be\ncaught in Shann's dream in turn, climbing up somewhere into the nose\nslit of a skull-shaped mountain?\n\nGreen fog without end, and Shann lost in it. How long had he been here?\nShann tried to reckon time, the time since his coming into the\nwater-world of the starred cavern. He realized that he had not eaten,\nnor drank, nor desired to do so either--nor did he now. Yet he was not\nweak; in fact, he had never felt such tireless energy as possessed his\nspare body.\n\nWas this _all_ a dream? His threatened drowning in the underground\nstream a nightmare? Yet there was a pattern in this, just as there had\nbeen a pattern in the needles he had spilled across the table. One even\nled to another with discernible logic; because he had tossed that\nparticular pattern he had come here.\n\nAccording to the ambiguous instructions or warnings of the Warlockian\nwitch, his safety in this place would depend upon his ability to tell\ntrue dreams from false. But how ... why? So far he had done nothing\nexcept walk through a green fog, and for all he knew, he might well be\ntraveling in circles.\n\nBecause there was nothing else to do, Shann walked on, his boots\npressing sand, rising from each step with a small sucking sound. Then,\nas he stooped to search for some indication of a path or road which\nmight guide him, his ears caught the slightest of noises--other small\nsucking whispers. He was not the only wayfarer in this place!\n\n\n\n\n13. HE WHO DREAMS....\n\n\nThe mist was not a quiet thing; it billowed and curled until it appeared\nto half-conceal darker shadows, any one of which could be an enemy.\nShann remained hunkered on the sand, every sense abnormally alert,\nwatching the fog. He was still sure he could hear sounds which marked\nthe progress of another. What other? One of the Warlockians tracking him\nto spy? Or was there some prisoner like himself lost out there in the\nmurk? Could it be Thorvald?\n\nNow the sound had ceased. He was not even sure from what direction it\nhad first come. Perhaps that other was listening now, as intent upon\nlocating him. Shann ran his tongue over dry lips. The impulse to call\nout, to try and contact any fellow traveler here, was strong. Only\nhard-learned caution kept him silent. He got to his hands and knees,\nuncertain as to his previous direction.\n\nShann crept. Someone expecting a man walking erect might be suitably\ndistracted by the arrival of a half-seen figure on all fours. He halted\nagain to listen.\n\nHe had been right! The sound of a very muffled footfall or footfalls,\ncarried to his ears. He was sure that the sound was louder, that the\nunknown was approaching. Shann stood, his hand close to his stunner. He\nwas almost tempted to spray that beam blindly before him, hoping to hit\nthe unseen by chance.\n\nA shadow--something more swift than a shadow, more than one of the\ntricks the curling fog played on eyes--was moving with purpose and\nstraight for him. Still, prudence restrained Shann from calling out.\n\nThe figure grew clearer. A Terran! It could be Thorvald! But remembering\nhow they had last parted, Shann did not hurry to meet him.\n\nThat shadow-shape stretched out a long arm in a sweep as if to pull\naside some of the vapor concealing them from each other. Then Shann\nshivered as if that fog had suddenly turned into the drive of frigid\nsnow. For the mist did roll back so that the two of them stood in an\nirregular clearing in its midst.\n\nAnd he did not front Thorvald.\n\nShann was caught up in the ice grip of an old fear, frozen by it, but\nsomehow clinging to a hope that he did not see the unbelievable.\n\nThose hands drawing the lash of a whip back into striking readiness ...\na brutal nose broken askew, a blaster burn puckering across cheek to\nmisshapen ear ... that, evil, gloating grin of anticipation. Flick,\nflick, the slight dance of the lash in a master's hand as those thick\nfingers tightened about the stock of the whip. In a moment it would\nwhirl up to lay a ribbon of fire about Shann's defenceless shoulders.\nThen Logally would laugh and laugh, his sadistic mirth echoed by those\nother men who played jackals to his rogue lion.\n\nOther men.... Shann shook his head dazedly. But he did not stand again\nin the Dump-size bar of the Big Strike. And he was no longer a\nterrorized youngster, fit meat for Logally's amusement. Only the whip\nrose, the lash curled out, catching Shann just as it had that time years\nago, delivering a red slash of pure agony. But Logally was dead, Shann's\nmind screamed, fighting frantically against the evidence of his eyes, of\nthat pain in his chest and shoulder. The Dump bully had been spaced by\noff-world miners, now also dead, whose claims he had tried to jump out\nin the Ajax system.\n\nLogally drew back the lash, preparing to strike again. Shann faced a man\nfive years dead who walked and fought. Or, Shann bit hard upon his lower\nlip, holding desperately to sane reasoning--did he indeed face anything?\nLogally was the ancient devil of his boyhood produced anew by the\nwitchery of Warlock. Or had Shann himself been led to recreate both the\nman and the circumstances of their first meeting with fear as a weapon\nto pull the creator down? Dream true or false. Logally _was_ dead;\ntherefore, this dream was false, it had to be.\n\nThe Terran began to walk toward that grinning ogre rising out of his old\nnightmares. His hand was no longer on the butt of his stunner, but swung\nloosely at his side. He saw the coming lash, the wicked promise in those\nsmall narrowed eyes. This was Logally at the acme of his strength, when\nhe was most to be feared, as he had continued to exist over the years in\nthe depths of a boy-child's memory. But Logally was _not_ alive; only in\na dream could he be.\n\nFor the second time the lash bit at Shann, curling about his body, to\ndissolve. There was no alteration in Logally's grin, His muscular arm\ndrew back as he aimed a third blow. Shann continued to walk forward,\nbringing up one hand, not to strike at that sweating, bristly jaw, but\nas if to push the other out of his path. And in his mind he held one\nthought: this was not Logally; it could not be. Ten years had passed\nsince they had met. And for five of those years Logally had been dead.\nHere was Warlockian witchery, to be met by sane Terran reasoning.\n\nShann was alone. The mist, which had formed walls, enclosed him again.\nBut still there was a smarting brand across his shoulder. Shann drew\naside the rags of his uniform blouse to discover a welt, raw and red.\nAnd seeing that, his unbelief was shaken.\n\nWhen he had believed in Logally and in Logally's weapon, the other had\nhad reality enough to strike that blow, make the lash cut deep. But when\nthe Terran had faced the phantom with the truth, then neither Logally\nnor his lash existed, Shann shivered, trying not to think what might lie\nbefore him. Visions out of nightmares which could put on substance! He\nhad dreamed of Logally in the past, many times. And he had had other\ndreams, just as frightening. Must he front those nightmares, all of\nthem----? Why? To amuse his captors, or to prove their contention that he\nwas a fool to challenge the powers of such mistresses of illusion?\n\nHow did they know just what dreams to use in order to break him? Or did\nhe himself furnish the actors and the action, projecting old terrors in\nthis mist as a tri-dee tape projected a story in three dimensions for\nthe amusement of the viewer?\n\nDream true--was this progress through the mist also a dream? Dreams\nwithin dreams.... Shann put his hand to his head, uncertain, badly\nshaken. But that stubborn core of determination within him was still\nholding. Next time he would be prepared at once to face down any\nresurrected memory.\n\nWalking slowly, pausing to listen for the slightest sound which might\nherald the coming of a new illusion, Shann tried to guess which of his\nnightmares might come to face him. But he was to learn that there was\nmore than one kind of dream. Steeled against old fears, he was met by\nanother emotion altogether.\n\nThere was a fluttering in the air, a little crooning cry which pulled at\nhis heart. Without any conscious thought, Shann held out his hands,\nwhistling on two notes a call which his lips appeared to remember more\nquickly than his mind. The shape which winged through the fog came\nstraight to his waiting hold, tore at long-walled-away hurt with its\nonce familiar beauty. It flew with a list; one of the delicately tinted\nwings was injured, had never healed straight. But the seraph nestled\ninto the hollow of Shann's two palms and looked up at him with all the\nold liquid trust.\n\n\"Trav! Trav!\" He cradled the tiny creature carefully, regarded with joy\nits feathered body, the curled plumes on its proudly held head, felt the\nsilken patting of those infinitesimal claws against his protecting\nfingers.\n\nShann sat down in the sand, hardly daring to breathe. Trav--again! The\nwonder of this never-to-be-hoped-for return filled him with a surge of\nhappiness almost too great to bear, which hurt in its way with as great\na pain as Logally's lash; it was a pain rooted in love, not fear and\nhate.\n\nLogally's lash....\n\nShann trembled. Trav raised one of those small claws toward the Terran's\nface, crooning a soft caressing cry for recognition, for protection,\ntrying to be a part of Shann's life once more.\n\nTrav! How could he bear to will Trav into nothingness, to bear to summon\nup another harsh memory which would sweep Trav away? Trav was the only\nthing Shann had ever known which he could love wholeheartedly, that had\nanswered his love with a return gift of affection so much greater than\nthe light body he now held.\n\n\"Trav!\" he whispered softly. Then he made his great effort against this\nsecond and far more subtle attack. With the same agony which he had\nknown years earlier, he resolutely summoned a bitter memory, sat nursing\nonce more a broken thing which died in pain he could not ease, aware\nhimself of every moment of that pain. And what was worse, this time\nthere clung that nagging little doubt. What if he had not forced the\nmemory? Perhaps he could have taken Trav with him unhurt, alive, at\nleast for a while.\n\nShann covered his face with his now empty hands. To see a nightmare\nflicker out after facing squarely up to its terror, that was no great\ntask. To give up a dream which was part of a lost heaven, that cut\ncruelly deep. The Terran dragged himself to his feet, drained and weary,\nstumbling on.\n\nWas there no end to this aimless circling through a world of green\nsmoke? He shambled ahead, moving his feet leadenly. How long had he been\nhere? There was no division in time, just the unchanging light which was\na part of the fog through which he plodded.\n\nThen he heard more than any shuffle of foot across sand, any crooning of\na long dead seraph, the rising and falling of a voice: a human\nvoice--not quite singing or reciting, but something between the two.\nShann paused, searching his memory, a memory which seemed bruised, for\nthe proper answer to match that sound.\n\nBut, though he recalled scene after scene out of the years, that voice\ndid not trigger any return from his past. He turned toward its source,\ndully determined to get over quickly the meeting which lay behind that\nsignal. Only, though he walked on and on, Shann did not appear any\ncloser to the man behind the voice, nor was he able to make out separate\nwords composing that chant, a chant broken now and then by pauses, so\nthat the Terran grew aware of the distress of his fellow prisoner. For\nthe impression that he sought another captive came out of nowhere and\ngrew as he cast wider and wider in his quest.\n\nThen he might have turned some invisible corner in the mist, for the\nchant broke out anew in stronger volume, and now he was able to\ndistinguish words he knew.\n\n    \"... where blow the winds between the worlds,\n    And hang the suns in dark of space.\n    For Power is given a man to use.\n    Let him do so well before the last accounting--\"\n\nThe voice was hoarse, cracked, the words spaced with uneven catches of\nbreath, as if they had been repeated many, many times to provide an\nanchor against madness, form a tie to reality. And hearing that note,\nShann slowed his pace. This was out of no memory of his; he was sure of\nthat.\n\n    \"... blow the winds between the worlds,\n    And hang the suns in ... dark--of--of--\"\n\nThat harsh croak of voice was running down, as a clock runs down for\nlack of winding. Shann sped on, reacting to a plea which did not lay in\nthe words themselves.\n\nOnce more the mist curled back, provided him with an open space. A man\nsat on the sand, his fists buried wrist deep in the smooth grains on\neither side of his body, his eyes set, red-rimmed, glazed, his body\nrocking back and forth in time to his labored chant.\n\n    \"... the dark of space--\"\n\n\"Thorvald!\" Shann skidded in the sand, went down on his knees. The\nmanner of their last parting was forgotten as he took in the officer's\ncondition.\n\nThe other did not stop his swaying, but his head turned with a stiff\njerk, the gray eyes making a visible effort to focus on Shann. Then some\nof the strain smoothed out of the gaunt features and Thorvald laughed\nsoftly.\n\n\"Garth!\"\n\nShann stiffened but had no chance to protest that mistaken\nidentification as the other continued: \"So you made class one status,\nboy! I always knew you could if you'd work for it. A couple of black\nmarks on your record, sure. But those can be rubbed out, boy, when\nyou're willing to try. Thorvalds always have been Survey. Our father\nwould have been proud.\"\n\nThorvald's voice flattened, his smile faded, there was a growing spark\nof some emotion in those gray eyes. Unexpectedly, he hurled himself\nforward, his hands clawing for Shann's throat. He bore the younger man\ndown under him to the sand where Lantee found himself fighting\ndesperately for his life against a man who could only be mad.\n\nShann used a trick learned on the Dumps, and his opponent doubled up\nwith a gasp of agony to let the younger man break free. He planted a\nknee on the small of Thorvald's back, digging the officer into the sand,\npinning down his arms in spite of the other's struggles. Regaining his\nown breath in gulps, Shann tried to appeal to some spark of reason in\nthe other.\n\n\"Thorvald! This is Lantee--Lantee----\" His name echoed in the mist-walled\nvoid like an unhuman wail.\n\n\"Lantee----? No, Throg! Lantee--Throg--killed my brother!\"\n\nSand puffed out with the breath, which expelled that indictment. But\nThorvald no longer fought, and Shann believed him close to collapse.\n\nShann relaxed his hold, rolling the other man over. Thorvald obeyed his\npull limply, lying face upward, sand in his hair and eyebrows, crusting\nhis slack lips. The younger man brushed the dirt away gently as the\nother opened his eyes to regard Shann with his old impersonal stare.\n\n\"You're alive,\" Thorvald stated bleakly. \"Garth's dead. You ought to be\ndead too.\"\n\nShann drew back, rubbed sand from his hands, his concern dampened by the\nother's patent hostility. Only that angry accusation vanished in a blink\nof those gray eyes. Then there was a warmer recognition in Thorvald's\nexpression.\n\n\"Lantee!\" The younger man might just have come into sight. \"What are you\ndoing here?\"\n\nShann tightened his belt. \"Just about what you are.\" He was still aloof,\ngiving no acknowledgment of difference in rank now. \"Running around in\nthis fog hunting the way out.\"\n\nThorvald sat up, surveying the billowing walls of the hole which\ncontained them. Then he reached out a hand to draw fingers down Shann's\nforearm.\n\n\"You _are_ real,\" he observed simply, and his voice was warm, welcoming.\n\n\"Don't bet on it,\" Shann snapped. \"The unreal can be mighty real--here.\"\nHis hand went up to the smarting brand on his shoulder.\n\nThorvald nodded. \"Masters of illusion,\" he murmured.\n\n\"Mistresses,\" Shann corrected. \"This place is run by a gang of pretty\nsmart witches.\"\n\n\"Witches? You've seen them? Where? And what--who are they?\" Thorvald\npounced with a return of his old-time sharpness.\n\n\"They're females right enough, and they can make the impossible happen.\nI'd say that classifies them as witches. One of them tried to take me\nover back on the island. I set a trap and caught her; then somehow she\ntransported me----\" Swiftly he outlined the chain of events leading from\nhis sudden awakening in the river tunnel to his present penetration of\nthis fog-world.\n\nThorvald listened eagerly. When the story was finished, he rubbed his\nhands across his drawn face, smearing away the last of the sand. \"At\nleast you have some idea of who they are and a suggestion of how you got\nhere. I don't remember that much about my own arrival. As far as I can\nremember I went to sleep on the Island and woke up here!\"\n\nShann studied him and knew that Thorvald was telling the truth. He could\nremember nothing of his departure in the outrigger, the way he had\nfought Shann in the lagoon. The Survey officer must have been under the\ncontrol of the Warlockians then. Quickly he gave the older man his\nversion of the other's actions in the outer world and Thorvald was\nclearly astounded, though he did not question the facts Shann presented.\n\n\"They just _took_ me!\" Thorvald said in a husky half whisper. \"But why?\nAnd why are we here? Is this a prison?\"\n\nShann shook his head. \"I think all this\"--a wave of his hand encompassed\nthe green wall, what lay beyond it, and in it--\"is a test of some kind.\nThis dream business.... A little while ago I got to thinking that I\nwasn't here at all, that I might be dreaming it all. Then I met you.\"\n\nThorvald understood. \"Yes, but this _could_ be a dream meeting. How can\nwe tell?\" He hesitated, almost diffidently, before he asked: \"Have you\nmet anyone else here?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Shann had no desire to go into that.\n\n\"People out of your past life?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Again he did not elaborate.\n\n\"So did I.\" Thorvald's expression was bleak; his encounters in the fog\nmust have proved no more pleasant than Shann's. \"That suggests that we\ndo trigger the hallucinations ourselves. But maybe we can really lick it\nnow.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Well, if these phantoms are born of our memories there are about only\ntwo or three we could see together--maybe a Throg on the rampage, or\nthat hound we left back in the mountains. And if we do sight anything\nlike that, we'll know what it is. On the other hand, if we stick\ntogether and one of us sees something that the other can't ... well,\nthat fact alone will explode the ghost.\"\n\nThere was sense in what he said. Shann aided the officer to his feet.\n\n\"I must be a better subject for their experiments than you,\" the older\nman remarked ruefully. \"They took me over completely at the first.\"\n\n\"You were carrying that disk,\" Shann pointed out. \"Maybe that acted as a\nfocusing lens for whatever power they use to make us play trained\nanimals.\"\n\n\"Could be!\" Thorvald brought out the cloth-wrapped bone coin. \"I still\nhave it.\" But he made no move to pull off the bit of rag about it.\n\"Now\"--he gazed at the wall of green--\"which way?\"\n\nShann shrugged. Long ago he had lost any idea of keeping a straight\ncourse through the murk. He might have turned around any number of times\nsince he first walked blindly into this place. Then he pointed to the\npacket Thorvald held.\n\n\"Why not flip that?\" he asked. \"Heads, we go that way--\" he indicated\nthe direction in which they were facing--\"tails, we do a\nrightabout-face.\"\n\nThere was an answering grin on Thorvald's lips. \"As good a guide as any\nwe're likely to find here. We'll do it.\" He pulled away the twist of\ncloth and with a swift snap, reminiscent of that used by the Warlockian\nwitch to empty the bowl of sticks, he tossed the disk into the air.\n\nIt spun, whirled, but--to their open-jawed amazement--it did not fall to\nthe sand. Instead it spun until it looked like a small globe instead of\na disk. And it lost its dead white for a glow of green. When that glow\nbecame dazzling for Terran eyes the miniature sun swung out, not in\norbit but in straight line of flight, heading to their right.\n\nWith a muffled cry, Thorvald started in pursuit, Shann running beside\nhim. They were in a tunnel of the fog now, and the pace set by the\nspinning coin was swift. The Terrans continued to follow it at the best\npace they could summon, having no idea of where they were headed, but\neach with the hope that they finally did have a guide to lead them\nthrough this place of confusion and into a sane world where they could\nface on more equal terms those who had sent them there.\n\n\n\n\n14. ESCAPE\n\n\n\"Something ahead!\" Thorvald did not slacken the pace set by the\nbrilliant spot of green they trailed. Both of the Terrans feared to fall\nbehind, to lose touch with that guide. Their belief that somehow the\ntraveling disk would bring them to the end of the mist and its attendant\nillusions had grown firmer with every foot of ground they traversed.\n\nA dark, fixed point, now partly veiled by mist, lay beyond, and it was\ntoward that looming half-shadow that the spinning disk hurtled. Now the\nmist curled away to display its bulk--larger, blacker and four or five\ntimes Thorvald's height. Both men stopped short, for the disk no longer\nplayed pathfinder. It still whirled on its axis in the air, faster and\nfaster, until it appeared to be throwing off sparks, but the sparks\nfaded against a monolith of dark rock unlike the native stone they had\nseen elsewhere. For it was neither red nor warmly brown, but a dull,\ndead black. It could have been a huge stone slab, trimmed, smoothed, set\nup on end as a monument or marker, except that only infinite labor could\nhave accomplished such a task, and there was no valid reason for such\ntoil as far as the Terrans could perceive.\n\n\"This is it.\" Thorvald moved closer.\n\nBy the disk's action, they deduced that their guide had drawn them to\nthis featureless black steel with the precision of a beam-controlled\nship. However, the purpose still eluded them. They had hoped for some\nexit from the territory of the veil, but now they faced a solid slab of\ndark stone, neither a conventional exit or entrance, as they proved by\ncircling its base. Beneath their boots was the eternal sand, around\nthem the fog.\n\n\"Now what?\" Shann asked. They had made their trip about the slab and\nwere back again where the disk whirled with unceasing vigor in a shower\nof emerald sparks.\n\nThorvald shook his head, scanning the rock face before them glumly. The\neagerness had gone out of his expression, a vast weariness replacing it.\n\n\"There must have been some purpose in coming here,\" he replied, but his\ntone had lost the assurance of moments earlier.\n\n\"Well, if we strike away from here, we'll just get right back in again.\"\nShann waved a hand toward the mist, waiting as if with a hunter's watch\nupon them. \"And we certainly can't go down.\" He dug a boot toe into the\nsand to demonstrate the folly of that. \"So, what about up?\"\n\nHe ducked under the spinning disk to lay his hands against the surface\nof the giant slab. And in so doing he made a discovery, revealed to his\ntouch although hidden from sight. For his fingers, running aimlessly\nacross the cold, slightly uneven surface of the stone, slipped into a\nhollow, quite a deep hollow.\n\nExcited, half fearing that his sudden guess might be wrong, Shann slid\nhis hand higher in line with that hollow, to discover a second. The\nfirst had been level with his chest, the second perhaps eighteen inches\nor so above. He jumped, to draw his fingers down the rock, with damage\nto his nails but getting his proof. There _was_ a third niche, deep\nenough to hold more than just the toe of a boot, and a fourth above\nthat....\n\n\"We've a ladder of sorts here,\" he reported. Without waiting for any\nanswer from Thorvald, Shann began to climb. The holds were so well\nmatched in shape and size that he was sure they could not be natural;\nthey had been bored there for use--the use to which he was now putting\nthem--a ladder to the top of the slab. Though what he might find there\nwas beyond his power to imagine.\n\nThe disk did not rise. Shann passed that core of light, climbing above\nit into the greater gloom. But the holes did not fail him; each was\nwaiting in a direct line with its companion. And to an active man the\nscramble was not difficult. He reached the summit, glanced around, and\nmade a quick grab for a secure handhold.\n\nWaiting for him was no level platform such as he had confidently\nexpected to find. The surface up which he had just made his way\nfly-fashion was the outer wall of a well or chimney. He looked down now\ninto a pit where black nothingness began within a yard of the top, for\nthe radiance of the mist did not penetrate far into that descent.\n\nShann fought an attack of giddiness. It would be very easy to lose\ncontrol, to tumble over and be swallowed up in what might well be a\nbottomless chasm. And what was the purpose of this well? Was it a trap\nto entice a prisoner into an unwary climb and then let gravity drag him\nover? The whole setup was meaningless. Perhaps meaningless only to him,\nShann conceded, with a flash of level thinking. The situation could be\nquite different as far as the natives were concerned. This structure did\nhave a reason, or it would never have been erected in the first place.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Thorvald's voice was rough with impatience.\n\n\"This thing's a well.\" Shann edged about a fraction to call back. \"The\ninside is open and--as far as I can tell--goes clear to the planet's\ncore.\"\n\n\"Ladder on the inside too?\"\n\nShann squirmed. That was, of course, a very obvious supposition. He kept\na tight hold with his left hand, and with the other, he did some\nexploring. Yes, here was a hollow right enough, twin to those on the\noutside. But to swing over that narrow edge of safety and begin a\ndescent into the black of the well was far harder than any action he had\ntaken since the morning the Throgs had raided the camp. The green mist\ncould hold no terrors greater than those with which his imagination\npeopled the depths now waiting to engulf him. But Shann swung over,\nfitted his boot into the first hollow, and started down.\n\nThe only encouragement he gained during that nightmare ordeal was that\nthose holes were regularly spaced. But somehow his confidence did not\nfeed on that fact. There always remained the nagging fear that when he\nsearched for the next it would not be there and he would cling to his\nperch lacking the needful strength in aching arms and legs to reclimb\nthe inside ladder.\n\nHe was fast losing that sense of well being which had been his during\nhis travels through the fog; a fatigue tugged at his arms and weighed\nleaden on his shoulders. Mechanically he prospected for the next hold,\nand then the next. Above, the oblong of half-light grew smaller and\nsmaller, sometimes half blotted out by the movements of Thorvald's body\nas the other followed him down that interior way.\n\nHow far _was_ down? Shann giggled lightheadedly at the humor of that, or\nwhat seemed to be humor at the moment. He was certain that they were now\nbelow the level of the sand floor outside the slab. And yet no end had\ncome to the well hollow.\n\nNo break of light down here; he might have been sightless. But just as\nthe blind develop an extra perceptive sense of unseen obstacles, so did\nShann now find that he was aware of a change in the nature of the space\nabout him. His weary arms and legs held him against the solidity of a\nwall, yet the impression that there was no longer another wall at his\nback grew stronger with every niche which swung him downward. And he was\nas sure as if he could see it, that he was now in a wide-open space,\nanother cavern; perhaps, but this one totally dark.\n\nDeprived of sight, he relied upon his ears. And there was a sound,\nfaint, distorted perhaps by the acoustics of this place, but keeping up\na continuous murmur. Water! Not the wash of waves with their persistent\nbeat, but rather the rippling of a running stream. Water must lie below!\n\nAnd just as his weariness had grown with his leaving behind the fog, so\nnow did both hunger and thirst gnaw at Shann, all the sharper for the\ndelay. The Terran wanted to reach that water, could picture it in his\nmind, putting away the possibility--the probability--that it might be\nsea-born and salt, and so unfit to drink.\n\nThe upper opening to the cavern of the fog was now so far above him that\nhe had to strain to see it. And that warmth which had been there was\ngone. A dank chill wrapped him here, dampened the holds to which he\nclung until he was afraid of slipping. While the murmur of the water\ngrew louder, until its _slap-slap_ sounded within arms' distance. His\nboot toe skidded from a niche. Shann fought to hold on with numbed\nfingers. The other foot went. He swung by his hands, kicking vainly to\nregain a measure of footing.\n\nThen his arms could no longer support him, and he cried out as he fell.\nWater closed about him with an icy shock which for a moment paralyzed\nhim. He flailed out, fighting the flood to get his head above the\nsurface where he could gasp in precious gulps of air.\n\nThere was a current here, a swiftly running one. Shann remembered the\none which had carried him into that cavern in which the Warlockians had\ntheir strange dwelling. Although there were no clusters of crystals in\nthis tunnel to supply him with light, the Terran began to nourish a\nfaint hope that he was again in that same stream, that those light\ncrystals would appear, and that he might eventually return to the\nstarting point of this meaningless journey.\n\nSo he strove only to keep his head above water. Hearing a splashing\nbehind him, he called out: \"Thorvald?\"\n\n\"Lantee?\" The answer came back at once; the splashing grew louder as the\nother swam to catch up.\n\nShann swallowed a mouthful of the water lapping against his chin. The\ntaste was brackish, but not entirely salt, and though it stung his lips,\nthe liquid relieved a measure of his thirst.\n\nOnly no glowing crystals appeared to stud these walls, and Shann's hope\nthat they were on their way to the cavern of the island faded. The\ncurrent grew swifter, and he had to fight to keep his head above water,\nhis tired body reacting sluggishly to commands.\n\nThe murmur of the racing flood drummed louder in his ears, or was that\nsound the same? He could no longer be sure. Shann only knew that it was\nclose to impossible to snatch the necessary breath as he was rolled over\nand over in the hurrying flood.\n\nIn the end he was ejected into blazing, blinding light, into a\nsuffocation of wild water as the bullet in an ancient Terran rifle might\nhave been fired at no specific target. Gasping, beaten, more than\nhalf-drowned, Shann was pummeled by waves, literally driven up on a\nrocky surface which skinned his body cruelly. He lay there, his arms\nmoving feebly until he contrived to raise himself in time to be\nwretchedly sick. Somehow he crawled on a few feet farther before he\nsubsided again, blinded by the light, flinching from the heat of the\nrocks on which he lay, but unable to do more for himself.\n\nHis first coherent thought was that his speculation concerning the\nreality of this experience was at last resolved. This could not possibly\nbe an hallucination; at least this particular sequence of events was\nnot. And he was still hazily considering that when a hand fell on his\nshoulder, fingers biting into his raw flesh.\n\nShann snarled, rolled over on his side. Thorvald, water dripping from\nhis rags--or rather steaming from them--his shaggy hair plastered to his\nskull, sat there.\n\n\"You all right?\"\n\nShann sat up in turn, shielding his smarting eyes. He was bruised,\nbattered badly enough, but he could claim no major injuries.\n\n\"I think so. Where are we?\"\n\nThorvald's lips stretched across his teeth in what was more a grimace\nthan a smile. \"Right off the map, any map I know. Take a look.\"\n\nThey were on a scrap of beach--beach which was more like a reef, for it\nlacked any covering comparable to sand except for some cupfuls of coarse\ngravel locked in rock depressions. Rocks, red as the rust of dried\nblood, rose in fantastic water-sculptured shapes around the small\nsemi-level space they had somehow won.\n\nThis space was V-shaped, washed by equal streams on either side of the\nprong of rock by water which spouted from the face of a sheer cliff not\ntoo far away, with force enough to spray several feet beyond its exit\npoint. Shann seeing that and guessing at its significance, drew a deep\nbreath, and heard the ghost of an answering chuckle from his companion.\n\n\"Yes, that's where we came out, boy. Like to make a return trip?\"\n\nShann shook his head, and then wished that he had not so rashly made\nthat move, for the world swung in a dizzy whirl. Things had happened too\nfast. For the moment it was enough that they were out of the underground\nways, back under the amber sky, feeling the bite of Warlock's sun.\n\nSteadying his head with both hands, Shann turned slowly, to survey what\nmight lie at their backs. The water, pouring by on either side,\nsuggested that they were again on an island. Warlock, he thought\ngloomily, seemed to be for Terrans a succession of islands, all hard to\nescape.\n\nThe tangle of rocks did not encourage any exploration. Just gazing at\nthem added to his weariness. They rose, tier by tier, to a ragged crown\nagainst the sky. Shann continued to sit staring at them.\n\n\"To climb that....\" His voice trailed into the silence of complete\ndiscouragement.\n\n\"You climb--or swim,\" Thorvald stated. But, Shann noted, the Survey\nofficer was not in a hurry to make either move.\n\nNowhere in that wilderness of rock was there the least relieving bit of\npurple foliage. Nor did any clak-claks or leather-headed birds tour the\nsky over their heads. Shann's thirst might have been partially assuaged,\nbut his hunger remained. And it was that need which forced him at last\ninto action. The barren heights promised nothing in the way of food,\nbut remembering the harvest the wolverines had taken from under the\nrocks along the river, he got to his feet and lurched out on the reef\nwhich had been their salvation, hunting some pool which might hold an\nedible captive or two.\n\nSo it was that Shann made the discovery of a possible path consisting of\na ledge running toward the other end of the island, if this were an\nisland where they had taken refuge. The spray of the water drenched that\nway, feeding small pools in the uneven surface, and strips of yellow\nweed trailed in slimy ribbons back below the surface of the waves.\n\nHe called to Thorvald and gestured to his find. And then, close\ntogether, linking hands when the going became hazardous, the men\nfollowed the path. Twice they made finds in the pools, finned or clawed\ngrotesque creatures, which they killed and ate, wolfing down the few\nfragments of odd-tasting flesh. Then, in a small crevice, which could\nhardly be dignified by the designation of \"cave,\" Thorvald chanced upon\na quite exciting discovery--a clutch of four greenish eggs, each as\nlarge as his doubled fist.\n\nTheir outer covering was more like tough membrane than true shell, and\nthe Terrans worried it open with difficulty. Shann shut his eyes, trying\nnot to think of what he mouthed as he sucked his share dry. At least\nthat semi-liquid stayed put in his middle, though he expected disastrous\nresults from the experiment.\n\nMore than a little heartened by this piece of luck, they kept on, though\nthe ledge changed from a reasonably level surface to a series of rising,\nunequal steps, drawing them away from the water. At long last they came\nto the end of that path. Shann leaned back against a convenient spur of\nrock.\n\n\"Company!\" he alerted Thorvald.\n\nThe Survey officer joined him to share an outcrop of rock from which\nthey were provided with an excellent view of the scene below, and it\nwas a scene to hold their full attention.\n\nThat soft sweep of sand which had floored the cavern of the fog lay here\nalso, a gray-blue carpet sloping gently out of the sea. For Shann had no\ndoubt that the wide stretch of water before them was the western ocean.\nWalling the beach on either side, and extending well out into the water\nso that the farthest piles were awash except for their crowns, were\npillars of stone, shaped with the same finish as that slab which had\nprovided them a ladder of escape. And because of the regularity of their\nspacing, Shann did not believe them works of nature.\n\nGrouped between them now were the players of the drama. One of the\nWarlockian witches, her gem body patterns glittering in the sunlight,\nwas walking backward out of the sea, her hands held palms together,\nbreast high, in a Terran attitude of prayer. And following her something\nswam in the water, clearly not another of her own species. But her\nactions suggested that by some invisible means she was drawing that\nwater dweller after her. Waiting on shore were two others of her kind,\nviewing her actions with close attention, the attention of scholars for\nan instructor.\n\n\"Wyverns!\"\n\nShann looked inquiringly at his companion. Thorvald added a whisper of\nexplanation. \"A legend of Terra--they were supposed to have a snake's\ntail instead of hind legs, but the heads.... They're Wyverns!\"\n\nWyverns. Shann liked the sound of that word; to his mind it well fitted\nthe Warlockian witches. And the one they were watching in action\ncontinued her steady backward retreat, rolling her bemused captive out\nof the water. What emerged into the blaze of sunlight was one of those\nfork-tailed sea dwellers such as the Terrans had seen die after the\nstorm. The thing crawled out of the shallows, its eyes focused in a\nblind stare on the praying hands of the Wyvern.\n\nShe halted, well up on the sand, when the body of her victim or\nprisoner--Shann was certain that the fork-tail was one or the\nother--was completely out of the water. Then, with lightning speed, she\ndropped her hands.\n\nInstantly fork-tail came to life. Fanged jaws snapped. Aroused, the\nbeast was the incarnation of evil rage, a rage which had a measure of\nintelligence to direct it into deadly action. And facing it, seemingly\nunarmed and defenseless, were the slender, fragile Wyverns.\n\nYet none of the small group of natives made any attempt to escape. Shann\nthought them suicidal in their indifference as fork-tail, short legs\nsending the fine sand flying in a dust cloud, made a rush toward its\nenemies.\n\nThe Wyvern who had led the beast ashore did not move. But one of her\ncompanions swung up a hand, as if negligently waving the monster to a\nstop. Between her first two digits was a disk. Thorvald caught at\nShann's arm.\n\n\"See that! It's a copy of the one I had; it must be!\"\n\nThey were too far away to be sure it was a duplicate, but It was\ncoin-shaped and bone-white. And now the Wyvern swung it back and forth\nin a metronome sweep. Fork-tail skidded to a stop, its head\nbeginning--reluctantly at first, and then, with increasing speed--to\necho that left-right sweep. This Wyvern had the sea beast under control,\neven as her companion had earlier held it.\n\nChance dictated what happened next. As had her sister charmer, the\nWyvern began a backward withdrawal up the length of the beach, drawing\nthe sea thing in her wake. They were very close to the foot of the drop\nabove which the Terrans stood, fascinated, when the sand betrayed the\nwitch. Her foot slipped into a hole and she was thrown backward, her\ncontrol disk spinning out of her fingers.\n\nAt once the monster she had charmed shot forth its head, snapped at that\nspinning trifle--and swallowed it. Then the fork-tail hunched in a\nposture Shann had seen the wolverines use when they were about to\nspring. The weaponless Wyvern was the prey, and both her companions were\ntoo far away to interfere.\n\nWhy he moved he could not have explained. There was no reason for him\nto go to the aid of the Warlockian, one of the same breed who had ruled\nhim against his will. But Shann sprang, landing in the sand on his hands\nand knees.\n\nThe sea thing whipped around, undecided between two possible victims.\nShann had his knife free, was on his feet, his eyes on the beast's,\nknowing that he had appointed himself dragon slayer for no good reason.\n\n\n\n\n15. DRAGON SLAYER\n\n\n\"Ayeeee!\" Sheer defiance, not only of the beast he fronted, but of the\nWyverns as well, brought that old rallying cry to his lips--the call\nused on the Dumps of Tyr to summon gang aid against outsiders. Fork-tail\nhad crouched again for a spring, but that throat-crackling blast\nappeared to startle it.\n\nShann, blade ready, took a dancing step to the right. The thing was\nscaled, perhaps as well armored against frontal attack as was the\nshell-creature he had fought with the aid of the wolverines. He wished\nhe had the Terran animals now--with Taggi and his mate to tease and\nfeint about the monster, as they had done with the Throg hound--for he\nwould have a better chance. If only the animals were here!\n\nThose eyes--red-pitted eyes in a gargoyle head following his every\nmovement--perhaps those were the only vulnerable points.\n\nMuscles tensed beneath that scaled hide. The Terran readied himself for\na sidewise leap, his knife hand raised to rake at those eyes. A brown\nshape with a V of lighter fur banding its back crossed the far range of\nShann's vision. He could not believe what he saw, not even when a\nsnarling animal, slavering with rage, came at a lumbering gallop to\nstand beside him, a second animal on its heels.\n\nUttering his own battle cry, Taggi attacked. The fork-tail's head swung,\nimitating the movements of the wolverine as it had earlier mimicked the\nswaying of the disk in the Wyvern's hand. Togi came in from the other\nside. They might have been hounds keeping a bull in play. And never had\nthey shown such perfect team work, almost as if they could sense what\nShann desired of them.\n\nThat forked tail lashed viciously, a formidable weapon. Bone, muscles,\nscaled flesh, half buried in the sand, swept up a cloud of grit into the\nface of the man and the animals. Shann fell back, pawing with his free\nhand at his eyes. The wolverines circled warily, trying for the attack\nthey favored--the spring to the shoulders, the usually fatal assault on\nthe spine behind the neck. But the armored head of the fork-tail, slung\nlow, warned them off. Again the tail lashed, and this time Taggi was\ncaught and hurled across the beach.\n\nTogi uttered a challenge, made a reckless dash, and raked down the\nlength of the fork-tail's body, fastening on that tail, weighing it to\nearth with her own poundage while the sea creature fought to dislodge\nher. Shann, his eyes watering from the sand, but able to see, watched\nthat battle for a long second, judging that fork-tail was completely\nengaged in trying to free its best weapon from the grip of the\nwolverine. The latter clawed and bit with a fury which suggested Togi\nintended to immobilize that weapon by tearing it to shreds.\n\nFork-tail wrenched its body, striving to reach its tormentor with fangs\nor clawed feet. And in that struggle to achieve an impossible position,\nits head slued far about, uncovering the unprotected area behind the\nskull base which usually lay under the spiny collar about its shoulders.\n\nShann went in. With one hand he gripped the edge of that collar--its\nserrations tearing his flesh--and at the same time he drove his knife\nblade deep into the soft underfolds, ripping on toward the spinal\ncolumn. The blade nicked against bone as the fork-tail's head slammed\nback, catching Shann's hand and knife together in a trap. The Terran was\njerked from his feet, and flung to one side with the force of the\nbeast's reaction.\n\nBlood spurted up, his own blood mingled with that of the monster. Only\nTogi's riding of the tail prevented Shann's being beaten to death. The\narmored snout pointed skyward as the creature ground the sharp edge of\nits collar down on the Terran's arm. Shann, frantic with pain, drove his\nfree fist into one of those eyes.\n\nFork-tail jerked convulsively; its head snapped down again and Shann was\nfree. The Terran threw himself back, keeping his feet with an effort.\nFork-tail was writhing, churning up the sand in a cloud. But it could\nnot rid itself of the knife Shann had planted with all his strength, and\nwhich the blows of its own armored collar were now driving deeper and\ndeeper into its back.\n\nIt howled thinly, with an abnormal shrilling. Shann, nursing his\nbleeding forearm against his chest, rolled free from the waves of sand\nit threw about, bringing up against one of the rock pillars. With that\nto steady him, he somehow found his feet, and stood weaving, trying to\nsee through the rain of dust.\n\nThe convulsions which churned up that concealing cloud were growing more\nfeeble. Then Shann heard the triumphant squall from Togi, saw her brown\nbody still on the torn tail just above the forking. The wolverine used\nher claws to hitch her way up the spine of the sea monster, heading for\nthe mountain of blood spouting from behind the head. Fork-tail fought to\nraise that head once more; then the massive jaw thudded into the sand,\nteeth snapping fruitlessly as a flood of grit overrode the tongue,\npacked into the gaping mouth.\n\nHow long had it taken--that frenzy of battle on the bloodstained beach?\nShann could have set no limit in clock-ruled time. He pressed his\nwounded arm tighter to him, lurched past the still twitching sea thing\nto that splotch of brown fur on the sand, shaping the wolverine's\nwhistle with dry lips. Togi was still busy with the kill, but Taggi lay\nwhere that murderous tail had thrown him.\n\nShann fell on his knees, as the beach around him developed a curious\ntendency to sway. He put his good hand to the ruffled back fur of the\nmotionless wolverine.\n\n\"Taggi!\"\n\nA slight quiver answered. Shann tried awkwardly to raise the animal's\nhead with his own hand. As far as he could see, there were no open\nwounds; but there might be broken bones, internal injuries he did not\nhave the skill to heal.\n\n\"Taggi?\" He called again gently, striving to bring that heavy head up on\nhis knee.\n\n\"The furred one is not dead.\"\n\nFor a moment Shann was not aware that those words had formed in his\nmind, had not been heard by his ears. He looked up, eyes blazing at the\nWyvern coming toward him in a graceful glide across the crimsoned sand.\nAnd in a space of heartbeats his thrust of anger cooled into a stubborn\nenmity.\n\n\"No thanks to you,\" he said deliberately aloud. If the Wyvern witch\nwanted to understand him, let her make the effort; he did not try to\ntouch her thoughts with his.\n\nTaggi stirred again, and Shann glanced down quickly. The wolverine\ngasped, opened his eyes, shook his miniature bear head, scattering\npellets of sand. He sniffed at a dollop of blood, the dark, alien blood,\nspattered on Shann's breeches, and then his head came up with a\nreassuring alertness as he looked to where his mate was still worrying\nthe now quiet fork-tail.\n\nWith an effort, Taggi got to his feet, Shann aiding him. The man ran his\nhand down over ribs, seeking any broken bones. Taggi growled a warning\nonce when that examination brought pain in its wake, but Shann could\ndetect no real damage. As might a cat, the wolverine must have met the\nshock of that whip-tail stroke relaxed enough to escape serious injury.\nTaggi had been knocked out, but now he was able to navigate again. He\npulled free from Shann's grip, lumbering across the sand to the kill.\n\nSomeone else was crossing that strip of beach. Passing the Wyvern as if\nhe did not see them, Thorvald came directly to Shann. A few seconds\nlater he had the torn arm stretched across his own bent knee, examining\nthe still bleeding hurt.\n\n\"That's a nasty one,\" he commented.\n\nShann heard the words and they made sense, but the instability of his\nsurroundings was increasing, while Thorvald's handling sent sharp stabs\nof pain up his arm and somehow into his head, where they ended in red\nbursts to cloud his sight.\n\nOut of the reddish mist which had fogged most of the landscape there\nemerged a single object, a round white disk. And in Shann's clouded mind\na well-rooted apprehension stirred. He struck out with his one hand, and\nthrough luck connected. The disk flew out of sight. His vision cleared\nenough so he could sight the Wyvern who had been leaning over Thorvald's\nshoulder centering her weird weapon on him. Making a great effort, Shann\ngot out the words, words which he also shaped in his mind as he said\nthem aloud: \"You're not taking me over--again!\"\n\nThere was no emotion to be read on that jewel-banded face or in her\nunblinking eyes. He caught at Thorvald, determined to get across his\nwarning.\n\n\"Don't let them use those disks on us!\"\n\n\"I'll do my best.\"\n\nOnly the haze had taken Thorvald again. Did one of the Wyverns have a\ndisk focused on them? Were they being pulled into one of those blank\nperiods, to awaken as prisoners once more--say, in the cavern of the\nveil? The Terran fought with every ounce of will power to escape\nunconsciousness, but he failed.\n\nThis time he did not awaken half-drowning in an underground stream or\nfacing a green mist. And there was an ache in his arm which was somehow\nreassuring with the very insistence of pain. Before opening his eyes,\nhis fingers crossed the smooth slick of a bandage there, went on to\ninvestigate by touch a sleep mat such as he had found in the cavern\nstructure. Was he back in that web of rooms and corridors?\n\nShann delayed opening his eyes until a kind of shame drove him to it. He\nfirst saw an oval opening almost the length of his body as it was\nstretched only a foot of two below the sill of that window. And through\nits transparent surface came the golden light of the sun--no green mist,\nno crystals mocking the stars.\n\nThe room in which he lay was small with smooth walls, much like that in\nwhich he had been imprisoned on the island. And there were no other\nfurnishings save the mat on which he rested. Over him was a light cover\nnetted of fibers resembling yarn, with feathers knotted into it to\nprovide a downy upper surface. His clothing was gone, but the single\ncovering was too warm and he pushed it away from his shoulders and chest\nas he wriggled up to see the view beyond the window.\n\nHis torn arm came into full view. From wrist to elbow it was encased in\nan opaque skin sheath, unlike any bandage of his own world. Surely that\nhad not come out of any Survey aid pack. Shann gazed toward the window,\nbut beyond lay only a reach of sky. Except for a lemon cloud or two\nruffled high above the horizon, nothing broke that soft amber curtain.\nHe might be quartered in a tower well above ground level, which did not\nmatch his former experience with Wyvern accommodations.\n\n\"Back with us again?\" Thorvald, one hand lifting a door panel, came in.\nHis ragged uniform was gone, and he wore only breeches of a sleek green\nmaterial and his own scuffed-and-battered boots.\n\nShann settled back on the mat. \"Where are we?\"\n\n\"I think you might term this the capital city,\" Thorvald answered. \"In\nrelation to the mainland, we're on an island well out to sea--westward.\"\n\n\"How did we get here?\" That climb in the slab, the stream underground....\nHad it been an interior river running under the bed of the sea? But\nShann was not prepared for the other's reply.\n\n\"By wishing.\"\n\n\"By _what_?\"\n\nThorvald nodded, his expression serious. \"They wished us here. Listen,\nLantee, when you jumped down to mix it with that fork-tailed thing, did\nyou wish you had the wolverines with you?\"\n\nShann thought back; his memories of what had occurred before that battle\nwere none too clear. But, yes, he had wished Taggi and Togi present at\nthat moment to distract the enraged beast.\n\n\"You mean I wished them?\" The whole idea was probably a part of the\nWyvern jargon of dreaming and he added, \"Or did I just dream\neverything?\" There was the bandage on his arm, the soreness under that\nbandage. But also there had been Logally's lash brand back in the\ncavern, which had bitten into his flesh with the pain of a real blow.\n\n\"No, you weren't dreaming. You happened to be tuned in one of those\nhandy little gadgets our lady friends here use. And, so tuned in, your\ndesire for the wolverines being pretty powerful just then, they came.\"\n\nShann grimaced. This was unbelievable. Yet there were his meetings with\nLogally and Trav. How could anyone rationally explain them? And how had\nhe, in the beginning, been jumped from the top of the cliff on the\nisland of his marooning into the midst of an underground flood without\nany conscious memory of an intermediate journey?\n\n\"How does it work?\" he asked simply.\n\nThorvald laughed. \"You tell me. They have these disks, one to a Wyvern,\nand they control forces with them. Back there on the beach we\ninterrupted a class in such control; they were the novices learning\ntheir trade. We've stumbled on something here which can't be defined or\nunderstood by any of our previous standards of comparison. It's frankly\nmagic, judged by our terms.\"\n\n\"Are we prisoners?\" Shann wanted to know.\n\n\"Ask me something I'm sure of. I've been free to come and go within\nlimits. No one's exhibited any signs of hostility; most of them simply\nignore me. I've had two interviews, via this mind-reading act of theirs,\nwith their rulers, or elders, or chief sorceresses--all three titles\nseem to apply. They ask questions, I answer as best I can, but sometimes\nwe appear to have no common meeting ground. Then I ask some questions,\nthey evade gracefully, or reply in a kind of unintelligible double-talk,\nand that's as far as our communication has progressed so far.\"\n\n\"Taggi and Togi?\"\n\n\"Have a run of their own and as far as I can tell are better satisfied\nwith life than I am. Oddly enough, they respond more quickly and more\nintelligently to orders. Perhaps this business of being shunted around\nby the disks has conditioned them in some way.\"\n\n\"What about these Wyverns? Are they all female?\"\n\n\"No, but their tribal system is strictly matriarchal, which follows a\npattern even Terra once knew: the fertile earth mother and her\npriestesses, who became the witches when the gods overruled the\ngoddesses. The males are few in number and lack the power to activate\nthe disks. In fact,\" Thorvald laughed ruefully, \"one gathers that in\nthis civilization our opposite numbers have, more or less, the status of\npets at the best, and necessary evils at the worst. Which put _us_ at a\ndisadvantage from the start.\"\n\n\"You think that they won't take us seriously because we are males?\"\n\n\"Might just work out that way. I've tried to get through to them about\ndanger from the Throgs, telling them what it would mean to them to have\nthe beetle-heads settle in here for good. They just brush aside the\nwhole idea.\"\n\n\"Can't you argue that the Throgs are males, too? Or aren't they?\"\n\nThe Survey officer shook his head. \"That's a point no human can answer.\nWe've been sparring with Throgs for years and there have been libraries\nof reports written about them and their behavior patterns, all of which\nadd up to about two paragraphs of proven facts and hundreds of surmises\nbeginning with the probable and skimming out into the wild fantastic.\nYou can claim anything about a Throg and find a lot of very intelligent\nsouls ready to believe you. But whether those beetle-heads squatting\nover on the mainland are able to answer to 'he,' 'she,' or 'it,' your\nsolution is just as good as mine. We've always considered the ones we\nfight to be males, but they might just as possibly be amazons. Frankly,\nthese Wyverns couldn't care less either; at least that's the impression\nthey give.\"\n\n\"But anyway,\" Shann observed, \"it hasn't come to 'we're all girls\ntogether' either.\"\n\nThorvald laughed again. \"Not so you can notice. We're not the only\nunwilling visitor in the vicinity.\"\n\nShann sat up. \"A Throg?\"\n\n\"A something. Non-Warlockian, or non-Wyvern. And perhaps trouble for\nus.\"\n\n\"You haven't seen this other?\"\n\nThorvald sat down cross-legged. The amber light from the window made\nred-gold of his hair, added ruddiness to his less-gaunt features.\n\n\"No, I haven't. As far as I can tell, the stranger's not right here. I\ncaught stray thought beams twice--surprise expressed by newly arrived\nWyverns who met me and apparently expected to be fronted by something\nquite physically different.\"\n\n\"Another Terran scout?\"\n\n\"No. I imagine that to the Wyverns we must look a lot alike. Just as we\ncouldn't tell one of them from her sister if their body patterns didn't\ndiffer. Discovered one thing about those patterns--the more intricate\nthey run, the higher the 'power,' not of the immediate wearer, but of\nher ancestors. They're marked when they qualify for their disk and\npresented with the rating of the greatest witch in their family line as\nan inducement to live up to those deeds and surpass them if possible.\nQuite a bit of logic to that. Given the right conditioning, such a\nsystem might even work in our service.\"\n\nThat nugget of information was the stuff from which Survey reports were\nmade. But at the moment the information concerning the other captive was\nof more value to Shann. He steadied his body against the wall with his\ngood hand and got to his feet. Thorvald watched him.\n\n\"I take it you have visions of action. Tell me, Lantee, why _did_ you\ntake that header off the cliff to mix it with fork-tail?\"\n\nShann wondered himself. He had no reason for that impulsive act. \"I\ndon't know----\"\n\n\"Chivalry? Fair Wyvern in distress?\" the other prodded. \"Or did the back\nlash from one of those disks draw you in?\"\n\n\"I don't know----\"\n\n\"And why did you use your knife instead of your stunner?\"\n\nShann was startled. For the first time he realized that he had fronted\nthe greatest native menace they had discovered on Warlock with the more\nprimitive of his weapons. Why had he not tried the stunner on the beast?\nHe had just never thought of it when he had taken that leap into the\nrole of dragon slayer.\n\n\"Not that it would have done you any good to try the ray; it has no\neffect on fork-tail.\"\n\n\"You tried it?\"\n\n\"Naturally. But you didn't know that, or did you pick up that\ninformation earlier?\"\n\n\"No,\" answer Shann slowly. \"No, I don't know why I used the knife. The\nstunner would have been more natural.\" Suddenly he shivered, and the\nface he turned to Thorvald was very sober.\n\n\"How much do they control us?\" he asked, his voice dropping to a half\nwhisper as if the walls about them could pick up those words and relay\nthem to other ears. \"What can they do?\"\n\n\"A good question.\" Thorvald lost his light tone. \"Yes, what can they\nfeed into our minds without our knowing? Perhaps those disks are only\nwindow dressing, and they can work without them. A great deal will\ndepend upon the impression we can make on these witches.\" He began to\nsmile again, more wryly. \"The name we gave this planet is certainly a\nmisnomer. A warlock is a male sorcerer, not a witch.\"\n\n\"And what are the chances of our becoming warlocks ourselves?\"\n\nAgain Thorvald's smile faded, but he gave a curt little nod to Shann as\nif approving that thought. \"That is something we are going to look into,\nand now! If we have to convince some stubborn females, as well as fight\nThrogs, well\"--he shrugged--\"we'll have a busy, busy, time.\"\n\n\n\n\n16. THIRD PRISONER\n\n\n\"Well, it works as good as new.\" Shann held his hand and arm out into\nthe full path of the sun. He had just stripped off the skin-case\nbandage, to show the raw seam of a half-healed scar, but as he flexed\nmuscles, bent and twisted his arm, there was only a small residue of\nsoreness left.\n\n\"Now what, or where?\" he asked Thorvald with some eagerness. Several\ndays' imprisonment in this room had made him impatient for the outer\nworld again. Like the officer, he now wore breeches of the green fabric,\nthe only material known to the Wyverns, and his own badly worn boots.\nOddly enough, the Terrans' weapons, stunner and knife, had been left to\nthem, a point which made them uneasy, since it suggested that the\nWyverns believed they had nothing to fear from clumsy alien arms.\n\n\"Your guess is as good as mine,\" Thorvald answered that double question.\n\"But it is you they want to see; they insisted upon it, rather\nemphatically in fact.\"\n\nThe Wyvern city existed as a series of cell-like hollows in the interior\nof a rock-walled island. Outside there had been no tampering with the\nnatural rugged features of the escarpment, and within, the silence was\nalmost complete. For all the Terrans could learn, the population of the\nstone-walled hive might have been several thousand, or just the handful\nthat they had seen with their own eyes along the passages which had been\ndeclared open territory for them.\n\nShann half expected to find again a skull-walled chamber where witches\ntossed colored sticks to determine his future. But he came with Thorvald\ninto an oval room in which most of the outer wall was a window. And\nseeing what lay framed in that, Shann halted, again uncertain as to\nwhether he actually saw that, or whether he was willed into visualizing\na scene by the choice of his hostesses.\n\nThey were lower now than the room in which he had nursed his wound, not\nfar above water level. And this window faced the sea. Across a stretch\nof green water was his red-purple skull, the waves lapping its lower\njaw, spreading their foam in between the gaping rock-fringe which formed\nits teeth. And from the eye hollows flapped the clak-claks of the sea\ncoast, coming and going as if they carried to some imprisoned brain\nwithin that giant bone case messages from the outer world.\n\n\"My dream----\" Shann said.\n\n\"Your dream.\" Thorvald had not echoed that; the answer had come in his\nbrain.\n\nShann turned his head and surveyed the Wyvern awaiting them with a\nconcentration which was close to the rudeness of an outright stare, a\nstare which held no friendship. For by her skin patterns he knew her for\nthe one who had led that triumvir who had sent him into the cavern of\nthe mist. And with her was the younger witch he had trapped on the night\nthat all this baffling action had begun.\n\n\"We meet again,\" he said slowly. \"To what purpose?\"\n\n\"To our purpose ... and yours----\"\n\n\"I do not doubt that it is to yours.\" The Terran's thoughts fell easily\nnow into a formal pattern he would not have used with one of his own\nkind. \"But I do not expect any good to me....\"\n\nThere was no readable expression on her face; he did not expect to see\nany. But in their uneven mind touch he caught a fleeting suggestion of\nbewilderment on her part, as if she found his mental processes as hard\nto understand as a puzzle with few leading clues.\n\n\"We mean you no ill, star voyager. You are far more than we first\nthought you, for you have dreamed false and have known. Now dream true,\nand know it also.\"\n\n\"Yet,\" he challenged, \"you would set me a task without my consent.\"\n\n\"We have a task for you, but already it was set in the pattern of your\ntrue dreaming. And we do not set such patterns, star man; that is done\nby the Greatest Power of all. Each lives within her appointed pattern\nfrom the First Awakening to the Final Dream. So we do not ask of you any\nmore than that which is already laid for your doing.\"\n\nShe arose with that languid grace which was a part of their delicate\njeweled bodies and came to stand beside him, a child in size, making his\nTerran flesh and bones awkward, clodlike in contrast. She stretched out\nher four-digit hand, her slender arm ringed with gemmed circles and\nbands, measuring it beside his own, bearing that livid scar.\n\n\"We are different, star man, yet still are we both dreamers. And dreams\nhold power. Your dreams brought you across the dark which lies between\nsun and distant sun. Our dreams carry us on even stranger roads. And\nyonder\"--one of her fingers stiffened to a point, indicating the\nskull--\"there is another who dreams with power, a power which will\ndestroy us all unless the pattern is broken speedily.\"\n\n\"And I must go to seek this dreamer?\" His vision of climbing through\nthat nose hole was to be realized then.\n\n\"You go.\"\n\nThorvald stirred and the Wyvern turned her head to him. \"Alone,\" she\nadded. \"For this is your dream only, as it has been from the beginning.\nThere is for each his own dream, and another cannot walk through it to\nalter the pattern, even to save a life.\"\n\nShann grinned crookedly, without humor. \"It seems that I'm elected,\" he\nsaid as much to himself as to Thorvald. \"But what do I do with this\nother dreamer?\"\n\n\"What your pattern moves you to do. Save that you do not slay him----\"\n\n\"Throg!\" Thorvald started forward. \"You can't just walk in on a Throg\nbarehanded and be bound by orders such as that!\"\n\nThe Wyvern must have caught the sense of that vocal protest, for her\ncommunication touched them both. \"We cannot deal with that one as his\nmind is closed to us. Yet he is an elder among his kind and his people\nhave been searching land and sea for him since his air rider broke upon\nthe rocks and he entered into hiding over there. Make your peace with\nhim if you can, and also take him hence, for his dreams are not ours,\nand he brings confusion to the Reachers when they retire to run the\nTrails of Seeking.\"\n\n\"Must be an important Throg,\" Shann deduced. \"They could have an officer\nof the beetle-heads under wraps over there. Could we use him to bargain\nwith the rest?\"\n\nThorvald's frown did not lighten. \"We've never been able to establish\nany form of contact in the past, though our best qualified minds,\nreinforced by training, have tried....\"\n\nShann did not take fire at that rather delicate estimate of his own lack\nof preparation for the carrying out of diplomatic negotiations with the\nenemy; he knew it was true. But there was one thing he could try--if the\nWyverns permitted.\n\n\"Will you give a disk of power to this star man?\" He pointed to\nThorvald. \"For he is my Elder One and a Reacher for Knowledge. With such\na focus his dream could march with mine when I go to the Throg, and\nperhaps that can aid in my doing what I could not accomplish alone. For\nthat is the secret of _my_ people, Elder One. We link our powers\ntogether to make a shield against our enemies, a common tool for the\nwork we must do.\"\n\n\"And so it is with us also, star voyager. We are not so unlike as the\nfoolish might think. We learned much of you while you both wandered in\nthe Place of False Dreams. But our power disks are our own and can not\nbe given to a stranger while their owners live. However....\" She turned\nagain with an abruptness foreign to the usual Wyvern manner and faced\nthe older Terran.\n\nThe officer might have been obeying an unvoiced order as he put out his\nhands and laid them palm to palm on those she held up to him, bending\nhis head so gray eyes met golden ones. The web of communication which\nhad held all three of them snapped. Thorvald and the Wyvern were linked\nin a tight circuit which excluded Shann.\n\nThen the latter became conscious of movement beside him. The younger\nWyvern had joined him to watch the clak-claks in their circling of the\nbare dome of the skull island.\n\n\"Why do they fly so?\" Shann asked her.\n\n\"Within they nest, care for their young. Also they hunt the rock\ncreatures that swarm in the lower darkness.\"\n\n\"The rock creatures?\" If the skull's interior was infested by some other\nnative fauna, he wanted to know it.\n\nBy some method of her own the young Wyvern conveyed a strong impression\nof revulsion, which was her personal reaction to the \"rock creatures.\"\n\n\"Yet you imprison the Throg there----\" he remarked.\n\n\"Not so!\" Her denial was instantaneous and vehement. \"The other worlder\nfled into that place in spite of our calling. There he stays in hiding.\nOnce we drew him out to the sea, but he broke the power and fled inside\nagain.\"\n\n\"Broke free----\" Shann pounced upon that. \"From disk control?\"\n\n\"But surely.\" Her reply held something of wonder. \"Why do you ask, star\nvoyager? Did you not also break free from the power of the disk when I\nled you by the underground ways, awaking in the river? Do you then rate\nthis other one as less than your own breed that you think him incapable\nof the same action?\"\n\n\"Of Throgs I know as much as this....\" He held up his hand, measuring\noff a fraction of space between thumb and forefinger.\n\n\"Yet you knew them before you came to this world.\"\n\n\"My people have known them for long. We have met and fought many times\namong the stars.\"\n\n\"And never have you talked mind to mind?\"\n\n\"Never. We have sought for that, but there has been no communication\nbetween us, neither of mind nor of voice.\"\n\n\"This one you name Throg is truly not as you,\" she assented. \"And we are\nnot as you, being alien and female. Yet, star man, you and I have shared\na dream.\"\n\nShann stared at her, startled, not so much by what she said as the human\nshading of those words in his mind. Or had that also been illusion?\n\n\"In the veil ...that creature which came to you on wings when you\nremembered that. A good dream, though it came out of the past and so was\nfalse in the present. But I have gathered it into my own store: such a\nfine dream, one that you have cherished.\"\n\n\"Trav was to be cherished,\" he agreed soberly. \"I found her in a broken\nsleep cage at a spaceport when I was a child. We were both cold and\nhungry, alone and hurt. So I stole and was glad that I stole Trav. For a\nlittle space we both were very happy....\" Forcibly he stifled memory.\n\n\"So, though we are unlike in body and in mind, yet we find beauty\ntogether if only in a dream. Therefore, between your people and mine\nthere can _be_ a common speech. And I may show you my dream store for\nyour enjoyment, star voyager.\"\n\nA flickering of pictures, some weird, some beautiful, all a little\ndistorted--not only by haste, but also by the haze of alienness which\nwas a part of her memory pattern--crossed Shann's mind.\n\n\"Such a sharing would be a rich feast,\" he agreed.\n\n\"All right!\" Those crisp words in his own tongue brought Shann away from\nthe window to Thorvald. The Survey officer was no longer locked hand to\nhand with the Wyvern witch, but his features were alive with a new\neagerness.\n\n\"We are going to try your idea, Lantee. They'll provide me with a new,\nunmarked disk, show me how to use it. And I'll do what I can to back you\nwith it. But they insist that you go today.\"\n\n\"What do they really want me to do? Just rout out that Throg? Or try to\ntalk him into being a go-between with his people? That _does_ come under\nthe heading of dreaming!\"\n\n\"They want him out of there, back with his own kind if possible.\nApparently he's a disruptive influence for them; he causes some kind of\na mental foul up which interferes drastically with their 'power.' They\nhaven't been able to get him to make any contact with them. This Elder\nOne is firm about your being the one ordained for the job, and that\nyou'll know what action to take when you get there.\"\n\n\"Must have thrown the sticks for me again,\" Shann commented.\n\n\"Well, they've definitely picked you to smoke out the Throg, and they\ncan't be talked into changing their minds about that.\"\n\n\"I'll be the smoked one if he has a blaster.\"\n\n\"They say he's unarmed----\"\n\n\"What do they know about our weapons or a Throg's?\"\n\n\"The other one has no arms.\" Wyvern words in his mind again. \"This fact\ngives him great fear. That which he has depended upon is broken. And\nsince he has no weapon, he is shut into a prison of his own terrors.\"\n\nBut an adult Throg, even unarmed, was not to be considered easy meat,\nShann thought. Armored with horny skin, armed with claws and those\ncrushing mandibles of the beetle mouth ... a third again as tall as he\nhimself was. No, even unarmed, the Throg had to be considered a menace.\n\nShann was still thinking along that line as he splashed through the surf\nwhich broke about the lower jaw of the skull island, climbed up one of\nthe pointed rocks which masqueraded as a tooth, and reached for a higher\nhold to lead him to the nose slit, the gateway to the alien's hiding\nplace.\n\nThe clak-claks screamed and dived about him, highly resentful of his\nintrusion. And when they grew so bold as to buffet him with their wings,\nthreaten him with their tearing beaks, he was glad to reach the broken\nrock edging his chosen door and duck inside. Once there, Shann looked\nback. There was no sighting the cliff window where Thorvald stood, nor\nwas he aware in any way of mental contact with the Survey officer; their\nhope of such a linkage might be futile.\n\nShann was reluctant to venture farther. His eyes had sufficiently\nadjusted to the limited supply of light, and now the Terran brought out\nthe one aid the Wyverns had granted him, a green crystal such as those\nwhich had played the role of stars on the cavern roof. He clipped its\nsimple loop setting to the front of his belt, leaving his hands free.\nThen, having filled his lungs for the last time with clean, sea-washed\nair, he started into the dome of the skull.\n\nThere was a fetid thickness to this air only a few feet away from the\nouter world. The odor of clak-clak droppings and refuse from their nests\nwas strong, but there was an added staleness, as if no breeze ever\nscooped out the old atmosphere to replace it with new. Fragile bones\ncrunched under Shann's boots, but as he drew away from the entrance, the\npale glow of the crystal increased its radiance, emitting a light not\nunlike that of the phosphorescent bushes, so that he was not swallowed\nup by dark.\n\nThe cave behind the nose hole narrowed quickly into a cleft, a narrow\ncleft which pierced into the bowl of the skull. Shann proceeded with\ncaution, pausing every few steps. There came a murmur rising now and\nagain to a shriek, issuing, he guessed, from the clak-clak rookery\nabove. And the pound of sea waves was also a vibration carrying through\nthe rock. He was listening for something else, at the same time testing\nthe ill-smelling air for that betraying muskiness which spelled Throg.\n\nWhen a twist in the narrow passage cut off the splotch of daylight,\nShann drew his stunner. The strongest bolt from that could not jolt a\nThrog into complete paralysis, but it would slow up any attack.\n\nRed--pinpoints of red--were edging a break in the rock wall. They were\ngone in a flash. Eyes? Perhaps of the rock dwellers which the Wyverns\nhated? More red dots, farther ahead. Shann listened for a sound he could\nidentify.\n\nBut smell came before sound. That trace of effluvia which in force could\nsicken a Terran, was his guide. The cleft ended in a space to which the\nlimited gleam of the crystal could not provide a far wall. But that\nfaint light did show him his quarry.\n\nThe Throg was not on his feet, ready for trouble, but hunched close to\nthe wall. And the alien did not move at Shann's coming. Did the\nbeetle-head sight him? Shann wondered. He moved cautiously. And the\nround head, with its bulbous eyes, turned a fraction; the mandibles\nabout the the ugly mouth opening quivered. Yes, the Throg could see him.\n\nBut still the alien made no move to rise out of his crouch, to come at\nthe Terran. Then Shann saw the fall of rock, the stone which pinned a\ndouble-kneed leg to the floor. And in a circle about the prisoner were\nthe small, crushed, furred things which had come to prey on the helpless\nto be slain themselves by the well-aimed stones which were the Throg's\nonly weapons of defense.\n\nShann sheathed his stunner. It was plain the Throg was helpless and\ncould not reach him. He tried to concentrate mentally on a picture of\nthe scene before him, hoping that Thorvald or one of the Wyverns could\npick it up. There was no answer, no direction. Choice of action remained\nsolely his.\n\nThe Terran made the oldest friendly gesture of his kind; his empty hands\nheld up, palm out. There was no answering move from the Throg. Neither\nof the other's upper limbs stirred, their claws still gripping the small\nrocks in readiness for throwing. All Shann's knowledge of the alien's\nhistory argued against an unarmed advance. The Throg's marksmanship, as\nborne out by the circle of small bodies, was excellent. And one of those\nrocks might well thud against his own head, with fatal results. Yet he\nhad been sent there to get the Throg free and out of Wyvern territory.\n\nSo rank was the beetle smell of the other that Shann coughed. What he\nneeded now was the aid of the wolverines, a diversion to keep the alien\nbusy. But this time there was no disk working to produce Taggi and Togi\nout of thin air. And he could not continue to just stand there staring\nat the Throg. There remained the stunner. Life on the Dumps tended to\nmake a man a fast draw, a matter of survival for the fastest and most\naccurate marksman. And now one of Shann's hands swept down with a speed\nwhich, learned early, was never really to be forgotten.\n\nHe had the rod out and was spraying on tight beam straight at the\nThrog's head before the first stone struck his shoulder and his weapon\nfell from a numbed hand. But a second stone tumbled out of the Throg's\nclaw. The alien tried to reach for it, his movements slow, uncertain.\n\nShann, his arm dangling, went in fast, bracing his good shoulder against\nthe boulder which pinned the Throg. The alien aimed a blow at the\nTerran's head, but again so slowly Shann had no difficulty in evading\nit. The boulder gave, rolled, and Shann cleared out of range, back to\nthe opening of the cleft, pausing only to scoop up his stunner.\n\nFor a long moment the Throg made no move; his dazed wits must have been\nworking at very slow speed. Then the alien heaved up his body to stand\nerect, favoring the leg which had been trapped. Shann tensed, waiting\nfor a rush. What now? Would the Throg refuse to move? If so, what could\nhe do about it?\n\nWith the impact of a blow, the message Shann had hoped for struck into\nhis mind. But his initial joy at that contact was wiped out with the\nsame speed.\n\n\"Throg ship ... overhead.\"\n\nThe Throg stood away from the wall, limped out, heading for Shann, or\nperhaps only the cleft in which he stood. Swinging the stunner awkwardly\nin his left hand, the Terran retreated, mentally trying to contact\nThorvald once more. There was no answer. He was well up into the cleft,\nmoving crabwise, unwilling to turn his back on the Throg. The alien was\ncoming as steadily as his injured limb would allow, trying for the exit\nto the outer world.\n\nA Throg ship overhead.... Had the castaway somehow managed to call his\nown kind? And what if he, Shann Lantee, were to be trapped between the\nalien and a landing party from the flyer? He did not expect any\nassistance from the Wyverns, and what could Thorvald possibly do? From\nbehind him, at the entrance of the nose slit, he heard a sound--a sound\nwhich was neither the scolding of a clak-clak nor the eternal growl of\nthe sea.\n\n\n\n\n17. THROG JUSTICE\n\n\nThe musty stench was so strong that Shann could no longer fight the\ndemands of his outraged stomach. He rolled on his side, retching\nviolently until the sour smell of his illness battled the foul odor of\nthe ship. His memories of how he had come into this place were vague;\nhis body was a mass of dull pain, as if he had been scorched. Scorched!\nHad the Throgs used one of their energy whips to subdue him? The last\nclear thing he could recall was that slow withdrawal down the cleft\ninside the skull rock, the Throg not too far away--the sound from the\nentrance.\n\nA Throg prisoner! Through the pain and the sickness the horror of that\nbit doubly deep. Terrans did not fall alive into Throg hands, not if\nthey had the means of ending their existence within reach. But his hands\nand arms were caught behind him in an unbreakable lock, some gadget not\nunlike the Terran force bar used to restrain criminals, he decided\ngroggily.\n\nThe cubby in which he lay was black-dark. But the quivering of the deck\nand the bulkheads about him told Shann that the ship was in flight. And\nthere could be but two destinations, either the camp where the Throg\nforce had taken over the Terran installations or the mother ship of the\nraiders. If Thorvald's earlier surmise was true and the aliens were\nhunting a Terran to talk in the transport, then they were heading for\nthe camp.\n\nAnd because a man who still lives and who is not yet broken can also\nhope, Shann began to think ahead to the camp--the camp and a faint,\nthin chance of escape. For on the surface of Warlock there was a thin\nchance; in the mother ship of the Throgs none at all.\n\nThorvald--and the Wyverns! Could he hope for any help from them? Shann\nclosed his eyes against the thick darkness and tried to reach out to\ntouch, somewhere, Thorvald with his disk--or perhaps the Wyvern who had\ntalked of Trav and shared dreams. Shann focused his thoughts on the\nyoung Wyvern witch, visualizing with all the detail he could summon out\nof memory the brilliant patterns about her slender arms, her thin,\nfragile wrists, those other designs overlaying her features. He could\nsee her in his mind, but she was only a puppet, without life, certainly\nwithout power.\n\nThorvald.... Now Shann fought to build a mental picture of the Survey\nofficer, making his stand at that window, grasping his disk, with the\nsun bringing gold to his hair and showing the bronze of his skin. Those\ngray eyes which could be ice, that jaw with the tight set of a trap upon\noccasion....\n\nAnd Shann made contact! He touched something, a flickering like a badly\ntuned tri-dee--far more fuzzy than the mind pictures the Wyvern had\nparaded for him. But he had touched! And Thorvald, too, had been aware\nof his contact.\n\nShann fought to find that thread of awareness again. Patiently he once\nmore created his vision of Thorvald, adding every detail he could\nrecall, small things about the other which he had not known that he had\nnoticed--the tiny arrow-shaped scar near the base of the officer's\nthroat, the way his growing hair curled at the ends, the look of one\neyebrow slanting abruptly toward his hairline when he was dubious about\nsomething. Shann strove to make a figure as vividly as Logally and Trav\nhad been in the mist of the illusion.\n\n\"... where?\"\n\nThis time Shann was prepared; he did not let that mind image dissolve in\nhis excitement at recapturing the link. \"Throg ship,\" he said the words\naloud, over and over, but still he held to his picture of Thorvald.\n\n\"... will....\"\n\nOnly that one word! The thread between them snapped again. Only then did\nShann become conscious of a change in the ship's vibration. Were they\nsetting down? And where? Let it be at the camp! It must be the camp!\n\nThere was no jar at that landing, just that one second the vibration\ntold him the ship was alive and air-borne, and the next a dead quiet\ntestified that they had landed. Shann, his sore body stiff with tension,\nwaited for the next move on the part of his captors.\n\nHe continued to lie in the dark, still queasy from the stench of the\ncell, too keyed up to try to reach Thorvald. There was a dull grating\nover his head, and he looked up eagerly--to be blinded by a strong beam\nof light. Claws hooked painfully under his arms and he was manhandled up\nand out, dragged along a short passage and pitched free of the ship,\nfalling hard upon trodden earth and rolling over gasping as the seared\nskin of his body was rasped and abraded.\n\nThe Terran lay face up now, and as his eyes adjusted to the light, he\nsaw a ring of Throg heads blotting out the sky as they inspected their\ncatch impassively. The mouth mandibles of one moved with a faint\nclicking. Again claws fastened in his armpits, brought Shann to his\nfeet, holding him erect.\n\nThen the Throg who had given that order moved closer. His hand-claws\nclasped a small metal plate surmounted by a hoop of thin wire over which\nwas stretched a web of threads glistening in the sun. Holding that hoop\non a level with his mouth, the alien clicked his mandibles, and those\nsounds became barely distinguishable basic galactic words.\n\n\"You Throg meat!\"\n\nFor a moment Shann wondered if the alien meant that statement literally.\nOr was it a conventional expression for a prisoner among their land.\n\n\"Do as told!\"\n\nThat was clear enough, and for the moment the Terran did not see that he\nhad any choice in the matter. But Shann refused to make any sign of\nagreement to either of those two limited statements. Perhaps the\nbeetle-heads did not expect any. The alien who had pulled him to his\nfeet continued to hold him erect, but the attention of the Throg with\nthe translator switched elsewhere.\n\nFrom the alien ship emerged a second party. The Throg in their midst was\nunarmed and limping. Although to Terran eyes one alien was the exact\ncounterpart of the other, Shann thought that this one was the prisoner\nin the skull cave. Yet the indications now suggested that he had only\nchanged one captivity for another and was in disgrace among his kind.\nWhy?\n\nThe Throg limped up to front the leader with the translator, and his\nguards fell back. Again mandibles clicked, were answered, though the\nsense of that exchange eluded Shann. At one point in the report--if\nreport it was--he himself appeared to be under discussion, for the\ninjured Throg waved a hand-claw in the Terran's direction. But the end\nto the conference came quickly enough and in a manner which Shann found\nshocking.\n\nTwo of the guards stepped forward, caught at the injured Throg's arms\nand drew him away, leading him out into a space beyond the grounded\nship. They dropped their hold on him, returning at a trot. The officer\nclicked an order. Blasters were unholstered, and the Throg in the field\nshriveled under a vicious concentration of cross bolts. Shann gasped. He\ncertainly had no liking for Throgs, but this execution carried overtones\nof a cold-blooded ferocity which transcended anything he had known, even\nin the callous brutality of the Dumps.\n\nLimp, and more than a little sick again, he watched the Throg officer\nturn away. And a moment later he was forced along in the other's wake to\nthe domes of the once Terran camp. Not just to the camp in general, he\ndiscovered a minute later, but to that structure which had housed the\ncom unit linking them with ships cruising the solar lanes and with the\npatrol. So Thorvald had been right; they needed a Terran to\nbroadcast--to cover their tracks here and lay a trap for the transport.\n\nShann had no idea how much time he had passed among the Wyverns; the\ntransport with its load of unsuspecting settlers might already be in the\nsystem of Circe, plotting a landing orbit around Warlock, broadcasting\nher recognition signal and a demand for a beam to ride her in. Only,\nthis time the Throgs were out of luck. They had picked up one prisoner\nwho could not help them, even if he wanted to do so. The mysteries of\nthe highly technical installations in this dome were just that to Shann\nLantee--complete mysteries. He had not the slightest idea of how to\nactivate the machines, let alone broadcast in the proper code.\n\nA cold spot of terror gathered in his middle, spreading outward through\nhis smarting body. For he was certain that the Throgs would not believe\nthat. They would consider his protestations of ignorance as a stubborn\nrefusal to co-operate. And what would happen to him then would be beyond\nhuman endurance. Could he bluff--play for time? But what would that time\nbuy him except to delay the inevitable? In the end, that small hope\nbased on his momentary contact with Thorvald made him decide to try that\nbluff.\n\nThere had been changes in the com dome since the capture of the cap. A\nsquat box on the floor sprouted a collection of tubes from its upper\nsurface. Perhaps that was some Throg equivalent of Terran equipment in\nplace on the wide table facing the door.\n\nThe Throg leader clicked into his translator: \"You call ship!\"\n\nShann was thrust down into the operator's chair, his bound arms still\ntwisted behind him so that he had to lean forward to keep on the seat at\nall. Then the Throg who had pushed him there, roughly forced a set of\ncom earphones and speech mike onto his head.\n\n\"Call ship!\" clicked the alien officer.\n\nSo time must be running out. Now was the moment to bluff. Shann shook\nhis head, hoping that the gesture of negation was common to both their\nspecies.\n\n\"I don't know the code,\" he said aloud.\n\nThe Throg's bulbous eyes gazed, at his moving lips. Then the translator\nwas held before the Terran's mouth. Shann repeated his words, heard them\nreissue as a series of clicks, and waited. So much depended now on the\nreaction of the beetle-head officer. Would he summarily apply pressure\nto enforce his order, or would he realize that it was possible that all\nTerrans did not know that code, and so he could not produce in a\ncaptive's head any knowledge that had never been there--with or without\nphysical coercion?\n\nApparently the latter logic prevailed for the present. The Throg drew\nthe translator back to his mandibles.\n\n\"When ship call--you answer--make lip talk your words! Say bad sickness\nhere--need help. Code man dead--you talk in his place. I listen. You say\nwrong, you die--you die a long time. Hurt bad all that time----\"\n\nClear enough. So he had been able to buy a little time! But how soon\nbefore the incoming ship would call? The Throgs seemed to expect it.\nShann licked his blistered lips. He was sure that the Throg officer\nmeant exactly what he said in that last grisly threat. Only, would\nanyone--Throg or human--live very long in this camp if Shann got his\nwarning through? The transport would have been accompanied on the big\njump by a patrol cruiser, especially now with Throgs littering deep\nspace the way they were in this sector. Let Shann alert the ship, and\nthe cruiser would know; swift punitive action would be visited on the\ncamp. Throgs could begin to make their helpless prisoner regret his\nrashness; then all of them would be blotted out together, prisoner and\ncaptors alike, when the cruiser came in.\n\nIf that was his last chance, he'd play it that way. The Throgs would\nkill him anyhow, he hadn't the least doubt of that. They kept no\nlong-term Terran prisoners and never had. And at least he could take\nthis nest of devil beetles along with him. Not that the thought did\nanything to dampen the fear which made him weak and dizzy. Shann Lantee\nmight be tough enough to fight his way out of the Dumps, but to stand up\nand defy Throgs face-to-face like a video hero was something else. He\nknew that he could not do any spectacular act; if he could hold out to\nthe end without cracking he would be satisfied.\n\nTwo more Throgs entered the dome. They stalked to the far end of the\ntable which held the com equipment, and frequently pausing to consult a\nTerran work tape set in a reader, they made adjustments to the spotter\nbeam broadcaster. They worked slowly but competently, testing each\ncircuit. Preparing to draw in the Terran transport, holding the large\nship until they had it helpless on the ground. The Terran began to\nwonder how they proposed to take the ship over once they did have it on\nplanet.\n\nTransports were armed for ground fighting. Although they rode in on a\nbeam broadcast from a camp, they were prepared for unpleasant surprises\non a planet's surface; such were certainly not unknown in the history of\nSurvey. Which meant that the Throgs had in turn some assault weapon they\nbelieved superior, for they radiated confidence now. But could they\nhandle a patrol cruiser ready to fight?\n\nThe Throg technicians made a last check of the beam, reporting in clicks\nto the officer. The alien gave an order to Shann's guard before\nfollowing them out. A loop of wire rope dropped over the Terran's head,\ntightened about his chest, dragging him back against the chair until he\ngrunted with pain. Two more loops made him secure in a most\nuncomfortable posture, and then he was left alone in the com dome.\n\nAn abortive struggle against the wire rope taught him the folly of such\nan effort. He was in deep freeze as far as any bodily movement was\nconcerned. Shann closed his eyes, settled to that same concentration he\nhad labored to acquire on the Throg ship. If there was any chance of the\nWyvern communication working again, here and now was the time for it!\n\nAgain he built his mental picture of Thorvald, as detailed as he had\nmade it in the Throg ship. And with that to the forefront of his mind,\nShann strove to pick up the thread which could link them. Was the\ndistance between this camp and the seagirt city of the Wyverns too\ngreat? Did the Throgs unconsciously dampen out that mental reaching as\nthe Wyverns had said they did when they had sent him to free the captive\nin the skull?\n\nDrops gathered in the unkempt tight curls on his head, trickled down to\nsting on his tender skin. He was bathed in the moisture summoned by an\neffort as prolonged and severe as if he labored physically under a hot\nsun at the top speed of which his body was capable.\n\nThorvald----\n\nThorvald! But not standing by the window in the Wyvern stronghold!\nThorvald with the amethyst of heavy Warlockian foliage at his back. So\nclear was the new picture that Shann might have stood only a few feet\naway. Thorvald there, with the wolverines at his side. And behind him\nsun glinted on the gem-patterned skin of more than one Wyvern.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\nThat demand from the Survey officer, curt, clear--so perfect the word\nmight have rung audibly through the dome.\n\n\"The camp!\" Shann hurled that back, frantic with fear than once again\ntheir contact might fail.\n\n\"They want me to call in the transport.\" He added that.\n\n\"How soon?\"\n\n\"Don't know. They have the guide beam set. I'm to say there's illness\nhere; they know I can't code.\"\n\nAll he could see now was Thorvald's face, intent, the officer's eyes\ncold sparks of steel, bearing the impress of a will as implacable as a\nThrog's. Shann added his own decision.\n\n\"I'll warn the ship off; they'll send in the patrol.\"\n\nThere was no change in Thorvald's expression. \"Hold out as long as you\ncan!\"\n\nCold enough, no promise of help, nothing on which to build hope. Yet the\nfact that Thorvald was on the move, away from the Wyvern city, meant\nsomething. And Shann was sure that thick vegetation could be found only\non the mainland. Not only was Thorvald ashore, but there were Wyverns\nwith him. Could the officer have persuaded the witches of Warlock to\nforesake their hands-off policy and join him in an attack on the Throg\ncamp? No promise, not even a suggestion that the party Shann had\nenvisioned was moving in his direction. Yet somehow he believed that\nthey were.\n\nThere was a sound from the doorway of the dome. Shann opened his eyes.\nThere were Throgs entering, one to go to the guide beam, two heading for\nhis chair. He closed his eyes again in a last attempt, backed by every\nremaining ounce of his energy and will.\n\n\"Ship's in range. Throgs here.\"\n\nThorvald's face, dimmer now, snapped out while a blow on Shann's jaw\nrocked his head cruelly, made his ears sing, his eyes water. He saw\nThrogs--Throgs only. And one held the translator.\n\n\"You talk!\"\n\nA tri-jointed arm reached across his shoulder, triggered a lever,\npressed a button. The head set cramping his ear let out a sudden growl\nof sound--the com was activated. A claw jammed the mike closer to\nShann's lips, but also slid in range the webbed loop of the translator.\n\nShann shook his head at the incoming rattle of code. The Throg with the\ntranslator was holding the other head set close to his own ear pit. And\nthe claws of the guard came down on Shann's shoulders in a cruel grip, a\nthreat of future brutality.\n\nThe rattle of code continued while Shann thought furiously. This was it!\nHe had to give a warning, and then the aliens would do to him just what\nthe officer had threatened. Shann could not seem to think clearly. It\nwas as if in his efforts to contact Thorvald, he had exhausted some part\nof his brain, so that now he was dazed just when he needed quick wits\nthe most!\n\nThis whole scene had a weird unreality. He had seen its like a thousand\ntimes on fiction tapes--the Terran hero menaced by aliens intent on\nsaving ... saving....\n\nWas it out of one of those fiction tapes he had devoured in the past\nthat Shann recalled that scrap of almost forgotten information?\n\nThe Terran began to speak into the mike, for there had come a pause in\nthe rattle of code. He used Terran, not basic, and he shaped the words\nslowly.\n\n\"Warlock calling--trouble--sickness here--com officer dead.\"\n\nHe was interrupted by another burst of code. The claws of his guard\ntwisted into the naked flesh of his shoulders in vicious warning.\n\n\"Warlock calling--\" he repeated. \"Need help----\"\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nThe demand came in basic. On board the transport they would have a list\nof every member of the Survey team.\n\n\"Lantee.\" Shann drew a deep breath. He was so conscious of those claws\non his shoulders, of what would follow.\n\n\"This is Mayday!\" he said distinctly, hoping desperately that someone in\nthe control cabin of the ship now in orbit would catch the true meaning\nof that ancient call of complete disaster. \"Mayday--beetles--over and\nout!\"\n\n\n\n\n18. STORM'S ENDING\n\n\nShann had no answer from the transport, only the continuing hum of a\ncontact still open between the dome and the control cabin miles above\nWarlock. The Terran breathed slowly, deeply, felt the claws of the Throg\nbite his flesh as his chest expanded. Then, as if a knife slashed, the\nhum of that contact was gone. He had time to know a small flash of\ntriumph. He had done it; he had aroused suspicion in the transport.\n\nWhen the Throg officer clicked to the alien manning the landing beam,\nShann's exultation grew. The beetle-head must have accepted that cut in\ncommunication as normal; he was still expecting the Terran ship to drop\nneatly into his claws.\n\nBut Shann's respite was to be very short, only timed by a few breaths.\nThe Throg at the riding beam was watching the indicators. Now he\nreported to his superior, who swung back to face the prisoner. Although\nShann could read no expression on the beetle's face, he did not need any\nclue to the other's probable emotions. Knowing that his captive had\nsomehow tricked him, the alien would now proceed relentlessly to put\ninto effect the measures he had threatened.\n\nHow long before the patrol cruiser would planet? That crew was used to\nalarms, and their speed was three or four times greater than that of the\nbulkier transports. If the Throgs didn't scatter now, before they could\nbe caught in one attack....\n\nThe wire rope which held Shann clamped to the chair was loosened, and he\nset his teeth against the pain of restored circulation, This was nothing\ncompared to what he faced; he knew that. They jerked him to his feet,\nfaced him toward the outer door, and propelled him through it with a\nspeed and roughness indicative of their feelings.\n\nThe hour was close to dusk and Shann glanced wistfully at promising\nshadows, though he had given up hope of rescue by now. If he could just\nget free of his guards, he could at least give the beetle-heads a good\nrun.\n\nHe saw that the camp was deserted. There was no sign about the domes\nthat any Throgs sheltered there. In fact, Shann saw no aliens at all\nexcept those who had come from the com dome with him. Of course! The\nrest must be in ambush, waiting for the transport to planet. What about\nthe Throg ship or ships? Those must have been hidden also. And the only\nhiding place for them would be aloft. There was a chance that the Throgs\nhad so flung away their chance for any quick retreat.\n\nYes; the aliens could scatter over the countryside and so escape the\nfirst blast from the cruiser. But they would simply maroon themselves to\nbe hunted down by patrol landing parties who would comb the territory.\nThe beetles could so prolong their lives for a few hours, maybe a few\ndays, but they were really ended on that moment when the transport cut\ncommunication. Shann was sure that the officer, at least, understood\nthat.\n\nThe Terran was dragged away from the domes toward the river down which\nhe and Thorvald had once escaped. Moving through the dusk in parallel\nlines, he caught sight of other Throg squads, well armed, marching in\norder to suggest that they were not yet alarmed. However, he had been\nright about the ships--there were no flyers grounded on the improvised\nfield.\n\nShann made himself as much of a burden as he could. At the best, he\ncould so delay the guards entrusted with his safekeeping; at the worst,\nhe could earn for himself a quick ending by blaster which would be\nbetter than the one they had for him. He went limp, falling forward into\nthe trampled grass. There was an exasperated click from the Throg who\nhad been herding him, and the Terran tried not to flinch from a sharp\nkick delivered by a clawed foot.\n\nFeigning unconsciousness, the Terran listened to the unintelligible\nclicks exchanged by Throgs standing over him. His future depended now on\nhow deep lay the alien officer's anger. If the beetle-head wanted to\ncarry out his earlier threats, he would have to order Shann's\ntransportation by the fleeing force. Otherwise his life might well end\nhere and now.\n\nClaws hooked once more on Shann. He was boosted up on the horny carapace\nof a guard, the bonds on his arms taken off and his numbed hands brought\nforward, to be held by his captor so that he lay helpless, a cloak over\nthe other's hunched shoulders.\n\nThe ghost flares of bushes and plants blooming in the gathering twilight\ngave a limited light to the scene. There was no way of counting the\nnumber of Throgs on the move. But Shann was sure that all the enemy\nships must have been emptied except for skeleton crews, and perhaps\nothers had been ferried in from their hidden base somewhere in Circe's\nsystem.\n\nHe could only see a little from his position on the Throg's back, but\nahead a ripple of beetle bodies slipped over the bank of the river cut.\nThe aliens were working their way into cover, fitting into the dapple\nshadows with a skill which argued a long practice in such elusive\nmaneuvers. Did they plan to try to fight off a cruiser attack? That was\npure madness. Or, Shann wondered, did they intend to have the Terrans\nmet by one of their own major ships somewhere well above the surface of\nWarlock?\n\nHis bearer turned away from the stream cut, carrying Shann out into that\nfield which had first served the Terrans as a landing strip, then\noffered the same service to the Throgs. They passed two more parties of\naliens on the move, manhandling with them bulky objects the Terran could\nnot identify. Then he was dumped unceremoniously to the hard earth, only\nto lie there a few seconds before he was flopped over on a framework\nwhich grated unpleasantly against his raw shoulders, his wrists and\nankles being made fast so that his body was spread-eagled. There was a\nclick of orders; the frame was raised and dropped with a jarring\nmovement into a base, and he was held erect, once more facing the Throg\nwith the translator. This was it! Shann began to regret every small\nchance he had had to end more cleanly. If he had attacked one of the\nguards, even with his hands bound, he might have flustered the Throg\ninto retaliatory blaster fire.\n\nFear made a thicker fog about him than the green mist of the illusion.\nOnly this was no illusion. Shann stared at the Throg officer with sick\neyes, knowing that no one ever quite believes that a last evil will\nstrike at him, that he had clung to a hope which had no existence.\n\n\"Lantee!\"\n\nThe call burst in his head with a painful force. His dazed attention was\noutwardly on the alien with the translator, but that inner demand had\ngiven him a shock.\n\n\"Here! Thorvald? Where?\"\n\nThe other struck in again with an urgent demand singing through Shann's\nbrain.\n\n\"Give us a fix point--away from camp but not too far. Quick!\"\n\nA fix point--what did the Survey officer mean? A fix point ... For some\nreason Shann thought of the ledge on which he had lain to watch the\nfirst Throg attack. And the picture of it was etched on his mind as\nclearly as memory could paint it.\n\n\"Thorvald----\" Again his voice and his mind call were echoes of each\nother. But this time he had no answer. Had that demand meant Thorvald\nand the Wyverns were moving in, putting to use the strange\ndistance-erasing power the witches of Warlock could use by desire? But\nwhy had they not come sooner? And what could they hope to accomplish\nagainst the now scattered but certainly unbroken enemy forces? The\nWyverns had not been able to turn their power against one injured\nThrog--by their own accounting--how could they possibly cope with\nwell-armed and alert aliens in the field?\n\n\"You die--slow----\" The Throg officer clicked, and the emotionless,\ntoneless translation was all the more daunting for that lack of color.\n\"Your people come--see----\"\n\nSo that was the reason they had brought him to the landing field. He was\nto furnish a grisly warning to the crew of the cruiser. However, there\nthe Throgs were making a bad mistake if they believed that his death by\nany ingenious method could scare off Terran retaliation.\n\n\"I die--you follow----\" Shann tried to make that promise emphatic.\n\nDid the Throg officer expect the Terran to beg for his life or a quick\ndeath? Again he made his threat--straight into the web, hearing it split\ninto clicks.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" the Throg returned. \"But you die the first.\"\n\n\"Get to it!\" Shann's voice scaled up. He was close to the ragged edge,\nand the last push toward the breaking point had not been the Throg\nspeech, but that message from Thorvald. If the Survey officer was going\nto make any move in the mottled dusk, it would have to be soon.\n\nMottled dusk.... The Throgs had moved a little away from him. Shann\nlooked beyond them to the perimeter of the cleared field, not really\nbecause he expected to see any rescuers break from cover there. And when\nhe did see a change, Shann thought his own sight was at fault.\n\nThose splotches of waxy light which marked certain trees, bushes, and\nscrubby ground-hugging plants were spreading, running together in pools.\nAnd from those center cores of concentrated glow, tendrils of mist\nlazily curled out, as a many-armed creature of the sea might allow its\nappendages to float in the water which supported it. Tendrils crossed,\nmet, and thickened. There was a growing river of eerie light which\nspread, again resembling a sea wave licking out onto the field. And\nwhere it touched, unlike the wave, it did not retreat, but lapped on.\nWas he actually seeing that? Shann could not be sure.\n\nOnly the gray light continued to build, faster now, its speed of advance\nmatching its increase in bulk. Shann somehow connected it with the veil\nof illusion. If it was real, there was a purpose behind it.\n\nThere was an aroused clicking from the Throgs. A blaster bolt cracked,\nits spiteful, sickly yellow slicing into the nearest tongue of gray. But\nthat luminous fog engulfed the blast and was not dispelled. Shann forced\nhis head around against the support which held him. The mist crept\nacross the field from all quarters, walling them in.\n\nRunning at the ungainly lope which was their best effort at speed were\nhalf a dozen Throgs emerging from the river section. Their attitude\nsuggested panic-stricken flight, and when one tripped on some unseen\nobstruction and went down--to fall beneath a descending tongue of\nphosphorescence--he uttered a strange high-pitched squeal, thin and\nfaint, but still a note of complete, mindless terror.\n\nThe Throgs surrounding Shann were firing at the fog, first with\nprecision, then raggedly, as their bolts did nothing to cut that opaque\ncurtain drawing in about them. From inside that mist came other\nsounds--noises, calls, and cries all alien to him, and perhaps also to\nthe Throgs. There were shapes barely to be discerned through the swirls;\nperhaps some were Throgs in flight. But certainly others were non-Throg\nin outline. And the Terran was sure that at least three of those shapes,\nall different, had been in pursuit of one fleeing Throg, heading him off\nfrom that small open area still holding about Shann.\n\nFor the Throgs were being herded in from all sides--the handful who had\ncome from the river, the others who had brought Shann there. And the\naction of the mist was pushing them into a tight knot. Would they\neventually turn on him, wanting to make sure of their prisoner before\nthey made a last stand against whatever lurked in the fog? To Shann's\ncontinued relief the aliens seemed to have forgotten him. Even when one\ncowered back against the very edge of the frame on which the Terran was\nbound, the beetle-head did not look at this helpless prey.\n\nThey were firing wildly, with desperation in every heavy thrust of\nbolt. Then one Throg threw down his blaster, raised his arms over his\nhead, and voicing the same high wail uttered by his comrade-in-arms\nearlier, he ran straight into the mist where a shape materialized,\nclosed in behind him, cutting him off from his fellows.\n\nThat break demoralized the others. The Throg commander burned down two\nof his company with his blaster, but three more broke past him to the\nfog. One of the remaining party reversed his blaster, swung the stock\nagainst the officer's carapace, beating him to his knees, before the\nattacker raced on into the billows of the mist. Another threw himself on\nthe ground and lay there, pounding his claws against the baked earth.\nWhile a remaining two continued with stolid precision to fire at the\nlurking shapes which could only be half seen; and a third helped the\nofficer to his feet.\n\nThe Throg commander reeled back against the frame, his musky body scent\nfilling Shann's nostrils. But he, too, paid no attention to the Terran,\nthough his horny arms scraped across Shann's. Holding both of his claws\nto his head, he staggered on, to be engulfed by a new arm of the fog.\n\nThen, as if the swallowing of the officer had given the mist a fresh\nappetite, the wan light waved in a last vast billow over the clear area\nabout the frame. Shann felt its substance cold, slimy, on his skin. This\nwas a deadly breath of un-life.\n\nHe was weakened, sapped of strength, so that he hung in his bounds, his\nhead lolling forward on his breast. Warmth pressed against him, a warm\nwet touch on his cold skin, a sensation of friendly concern in his mind.\nShann gasped, found that he was no longer filling his lungs with that\nchill staleness which was the breath of the fog. He opened his eyes,\nstruggling to raise his head. The gray light had retreated, but though a\nThrog blaster lay close to his feet, another only a yard beyond, there\nwas no sign of the aliens.\n\nInstead, standing on their hind feet to press against him in a demand\nfor his attention, were the wolverines. And seeing them, Shann dared to\nbelieve that the impossible could be true; somehow he was safe.\n\nHe spoke. And Taggi and Togi answered with eager whines. The mist was\nwithdrawing more slowly than it had come. Here and there things lay very\nstill on the ground.\n\n\"Lantee!\"\n\nThis time the call came not into his mind but out of the air. Shann made\nan effort at reply which was close to a croak.\n\n\"Over here!\"\n\nA new shape in the fog was moving with purpose toward him. Thorvald\nstrode into the open, sighted Shann, and began to run.\n\n\"What did they----?\" he began.\n\nShann wanted to laugh, but the sound which issued from his dry throat\nwas very little like mirth. He struggled helplessly until he managed to\nget out some words which made sense.\n\n\"... hadn't started in on me yet. You were just in time.\"\n\nThorvald loosened the wires which held the younger man to the frame and\nstood ready to catch him as he slumped forward. And the officer's hold\nwiped away the last clammy residue of the mist. Though he did not seem\nable to keep on his feet, Shann's mind was clear.\n\n\"What happened?\" he demanded.\n\n\"The power.\" Thorvald was examining him hastily but with attention for\nevery cut and bruise. \"The beetle-heads didn't really get to work on\nyou----\"\n\n\"Told you that,\" Shann said impatiently. \"But what brought that fog and\ngot the Throgs?\"\n\nThorvald smiled grimly. The ghostly light was fading as the fog\nretreated, but Shann could see well enough to note that around the\nother's neck hung one of the Wyvern disks.\n\n\"It was a variation of the veil of illusion. You faced your memories\nunder the influence of that; so did I. But it would seem that the Throgs\nhad ones worse than either of us could produce. You can't play the role\nof thug all over the galaxy and not store up in the subconscious a fine\nline of private fears and remembered enemies. We provided the means for\nreleasing those, and they simply raised their own devils to order.\nNeatest justice ever rendered. It seems that the 'power' has a big\nkick--in a different way--when a Terran will manages to spark it.\"\n\n\"And you did?\"\n\n\"I made a small beginning. Also I had the full backing of the Elders,\nand a general staff of Wyverns in support. In a way I helped to provide\na channel for their concentration. Alone they can work 'magic'; with us\nthey can spread out into new fields. Tonight we hunted Throgs as a\nunited team--most successfully.\"\n\n\"But they wouldn't go after the one in the skull.\"\n\n\"No. Direct contact with a Throg mind appears to short-circuit them. I\ndid the contacting; they fed me what I needed. We have the answer to the\nThrogs now--one answer.\" Thorvald looked back over the field where those\nbodies lay so still. \"We can kill Throgs. Maybe someday we can learn\nanother trick--how to live with them.\" He returned abruptly to the\npresent. \"You did contact the transport?\"\n\nShann explained what had happened in the com dome. \"I think when the\nship broke contact that way they understood.\"\n\n\"We'll take it that they did, and be on the move.\" Thorvald helped Shann\nto his feet. \"If a cruiser berths here shortly, I don't propose to be\nunder its tail flames when it sets down.\"\n\nThe cruiser came. And a mop-up squad patrolled outward from the\nreclaimed camp, picked up two living Throgs, both wandering witlessly.\nBut Shann only heard of that later. He slept, so deep and dreamlessly\nthat when he roused he was momentarily dazed.\n\nA Survey uniform--with a cadet's badges--lay across the wall seat facing\nhis bunk in the barracks he had left ... how many days or weeks before?\nThe garments fitted well enough, but he removed the insignia to which he\nwas not entitled. When he ventured out he saw half a dozen troopers of\nthe patrol, together with Thorvald, watching the cruiser lift again into\nthe morning sky.\n\nTaggi and Togi, trailing leashes, galloped out of nowhere to hurl\nthemselves at him in uproarious welcome. And Thorvald must have heard\ntheir eager whines even through the blast of the ship, for he turned and\nwaved Shann to join him.\n\n\"Where is the cruiser going?\"\n\n\"To punch a Throg base out of this system,\" Thorvald answered. \"They\nlocated it--on Witch.\"\n\n\"But we're staying on here?\"\n\nThorvald glanced at him oddly. \"There won't be any settlement now. But\nwe have to establish a conditional embassy post. And the patrol has left\na guard.\"\n\nEmbassy post. Shann digested that. Yes, of course, Thorvald, because of\nhis close contact with the Wyverns, would be left here for the present\nto act as liaison officer-in-charge.\n\n\"We don't propose,\" the other was continuing, \"to allow to lapse any\ncontact with the one intelligent alien race we have discovered who can\nfurnish us with full-time partnership to our mutual benefit. And there\nmustn't be any bungling here!\"\n\nShann nodded. That made sense. As soon as possible Warlock would witness\nthe arrival of another team, one slanted this time to the cultivation of\nan alien friendship and alliance, rather than preparation for Terran\ncolonists. Would they keep him on? He supposed not; the wolverines'\nusefulness was no longer apparent.\n\n\"Don't you know your regulations?\" There was a snap in Thorvald's demand\nwhich startled Shann. He glanced up, discovered the other surveying him\ncritically. \"You're not in uniform----\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" he admitted. \"I couldn't find my own kit.\"\n\n\"Where are your badges?\"\n\nShann's hand went up to the marks left when he had so carefully ripped\noff the insignia.\n\n\"My badges? I have no rank,\" he replied, bewildered.\n\n\"Every team carries at least one cadet on strength.\"\n\nShann flushed. There had been one cadet on this team; why did Thorvald\nwant to remember that?\n\n\"Also,\" the other's voice sounded remote, \"there can be appointments\nmade in the field--for cause. Those appointments are left to the\ndiscretion of the officer-in-charge, and they are never questioned. I\nrepeat, you are not in uniform, Lantee. You will make the necessary\nalteration and report to me at headquarters dome. As sole\nrepresentatives of Terra here we have a matter of protocol to be\ndiscussed with our witches, and they have a right to expect punctuality\nfrom a pair of warlocks, so get going!\"\n\nShann still stood, staring incredulously at the officer. Then Thorvald's\nofficial severity vanished in a smile which was warm and real.\n\n\"Get going,\" he ordered once more, \"before I have to log you for\ninattention to orders.\"\n\nShann turned, nearly stumbling over Taggi, and then ran back to the\nbarracks in quest of some very important bits of braid he hoped he could\nfind in a hurry.\n\n\n\n\nSTORM OVER WARLOCK\n\n\n\"A satisfying and mature novel which readers will seize upon if they\nwant to enjoy a good adventure story.\n\n\"A survey base on a remote planet is wiped out by a raid of Earth's\nenemies, the Throgs; the only survivor must face the perils of an\nunexplored planet while trying somehow to strike back at the enemy....\n\n\"As always Norton creates both human and alien beings well, and tells a\nstory that you can't stop reading.\"\n\n--_New York Herald Tribune_\n\n\n\"UP TO NORTON'S BEST STANDARDS.\"\n\n--_Library Journal_\n\n\nThe Throg task force struck the Terran survey camp a few minutes after\ndawn, without warning, and with a deadly precision which argued that the\naliens had fully reconnoitered and prepared that attack. Eye-searing\nlances of energy lashed back and forth across the base with methodical\naccuracy. And a single cowering witness, flattened on a ledge in the\nheights above, knew that when the last of those yellow-red bolts fell,\nnothing human would be left alive down there.\n\nAnd so Shann Lantee, most menial of the Terrans attached to the camp on\nthe planet Warlock, was left alone and weaponless in the strange,\nhostile world, the human prey of the aliens from space and the aliens on\nthe ground alike.\n\n\nANDRE NORTON has become one of the highest rated authors of\nscience-fiction adventure now writing.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
