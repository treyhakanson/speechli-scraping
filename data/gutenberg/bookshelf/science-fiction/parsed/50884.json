Boyle, it's got to be\nstopped!\"\n\nHe put his elbows on Moira's antique conversation table and leaned\ntoward the older man, his eyes hot and anxious.\n\n\"There are only the two of them--Fermiirig and Santikh; you've\nprobably seen stills of them on the visinews a hundred times--and\nAL&O has kept them so closely under cover that we of the Social Body\nnever get more than occasional rumors about what they're really\nlike. But I know from what I overheard that they're carbonstructure\noxygen-breathers with a metabolism very much like our own. What affects\nthem physically will affect us also. And the offer they've made\nCornelison and Bissell and Dorand of Administrative Council is genuine.\nIt amounts to a lot more than simple longevity, because the process can\nbe repeated. In effect, it's--\"\n\n\"_Immortality_,\" Boyle said, and forgot the younger man on the instant.\n\nThe shock of it as a reality blossomed in his mind with a slow\nexplosion of triumph. It had come in his time, after all, and the fact\nthat the secret belonged to the first interstellar visitors to reach\nEarth had no bearing whatever on his determination to possess it.\nNeither had the knowledge that the Alcorians had promised the process\nonly to the highest of government bodies, Administrative Council. The\nwhole of AL&O--Administration, Legislation and Order--could not keep it\nfrom him.\n\n\"It isn't _right_,\" Locke said heatedly. \"It doesn't fit in with what\nwe've been taught to believe, Boyle. We're still a modified democracy,\nand the Social Body _is_ the Weal. We can't permit Cornelison and\nBissell and Dorand to take what amounts to immortality for themselves\nand deny it to the populace. That's tyranny!\"\n\nThe charge brought Boyle out of his preoccupation with a start. For\nthe moment, he had forgotten Locke's presence in Moira's apartment. He\nhad even forgotten his earlier annoyance with Moira for allowing the\nsophomoric fool visitor's privilege when it was Boyle's week, to the\nexclusion of the other two husbands in Moira's marital-seven, to share\nthe connubial right with her.\n\nBut the opportunity tumbled so forcibly into his lap was not one to\nbe handled lightly. He held in check his contempt for Locke and his\nirritation with Moira until he had considered his windfall from every\nangle, and had marshalled its possibilities into a working outline of\nhis coup to come.\n\nHe even checked his lapel watch against the time of Moira's return from\nthe theater before he answered Locke. With characteristic cynicism, he\ntook it for granted that Locke, in his indignation, had already shared\nhis discovery with Moira, and in cold logic he marked her down with\nLocke for disposal once her purpose was served. Moira had been the most\nsatisfactory of the four women in Boyle's marital-seven, but when he\nweighed her attractions against the possible immortality ahead, the\ncomparison did not sway his resolution for an instant.\n\nMoira, like Locke, would have to go.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You're sure there was no error?\" Boyle asked. \"You couldn't have been\nmistaken?\"\n\n\"I heard it,\" Locke said stubbornly.\n\nHe clenched his fists angrily, patently reliving his shock of\ndiscovery. \"I was running a routine check on Administration visiphone\nchannels--it's part of my work as communications technician at\nAL&O--when I ran across a circuit that had blown its scrambler.\nOrdinarily I'd have replaced the dead unit without listening to\nplain-talk longer than was necessary to identify the circuit. But by\nthe time I had it tagged as a Council channel, I'd heard enough from\nCornelison and Bissell and Dorand to convince me that I owed it to the\nSocial Body to hear the rest. And now I'm holding a tiger by the tail,\nbecause I'm subject to truth-check. That's why I came to you with this,\nBoyle. Naturally, since you are President of Transplanet Enterprises--\"\n\n\"I know,\" Boyle cut in, forestalling digression. Locke's job, not\nintrinsically important in itself, still demanded a high degree of\nintegrity and left him open to serum-and-psycho check, as though he\nwere an actual member of AL&O or a politician. \"If anyone knew what\nyou've overheard, you'd get a compulsory truth-check, admit your guilt\npublicly and take an imprisonment sentence from the Board of Order. But\nyour duty came first, of course. Go on.\"\n\n\"They were discussing the Alcorians' offer of longevity when I cut\ninto the circuit. Bissell and Dorand were all for accepting at once,\nbut Cornelison pretended indecision and had to be coaxed. Oh, he came\naround quickly enough; the three of them are to meet Fermiirig and\nSantikh tomorrow morning at nine in the AL&O deliberations chamber for\ntheir injections. You should have heard them rationalizing that, Boyle.\nIt would have sickened you.\"\n\n\"I know the routine--they're doing it for the good of the Social Body,\nof course. What puzzles me is why the Alcorians should give away a\nsecret so valuable.\"\n\n\"Trojan horse tactics,\" Locke said flatly. \"They claim to have\narrived at a culture pretty much like our own, except for a superior\ntechnology and a custom of prolonging the lives of administrators\nthey find best fitted to govern. They're posing as philanthropists\nby offering us the same opportunity, but actually they're sabotaging\nour political economy. They know that the Social Body won't stand for\nthe Council accepting an immortality restricted to itself. That sort\nof discrimination would stir up a brawl that might shatter the Weal\nforever.\"\n\nDeliberately, Boyle fanned the younger man's resentment. \"Not a bad\nthing for those in power. But it _is_ rough on simple members of the\nSocial Body like ourselves, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It's criminal conspiracy,\" Locke said hotly. \"They should be\ntruth-checked and given life-maximum detention. If we took this to the\nBoard of Order--\"\n\n\"No. Think a moment and you'll understand why.\"\n\nBoyle had gauged his man, he saw, to a nicety. Locke was typical of\nthis latest generation, packed to the ears with juvenile idealism\nand social consciousness, presenting a finished product of AL&O's\ngolden-rule ideology that was no more difficult to predict than a\ntextbook problem in elementary psychology. To a veteran strategist\nlike Boyle, Locke was more than a handy asset; he was a tool shaped\nto respond to duty unquestioningly and to cupidity not at all, and\ntherefore an agent more readily amenable than any mercenary could have\nbeen.\n\n\"But I _don't_ understand,\" Locke said, puzzled. \"Even Administration\nand Legislation are answerable to Order. It's the Board's duty to bring\nthem to account if necessary.\"\n\n\"Administration couldn't possibly confirm itself in power from the\nbeginning without the backing of Order and Legislation,\" Boyle pointed\nout. \"Cornelison and Bissell and Dorand would have to extend the\nlongevity privilege to the other two groups, don't you see, in order\nto protect themselves. And that means that Administrative Council is\nnot alone in this thing--it's AL&O as a body. If you went to the Board\nof Order with your protest, the report would die on the spot. So,\nprobably, would you.\"\n\nHe felt a touch of genuine amusement at Locke's slack stare of horror.\nThe seed was planted; now to see how readily the fool would react to a\nlogical alternative, and how useful in his reaction he might be.\n\n\"I know precisely how you feel,\" Boyle said. \"It goes against our\nconditioned grain to find officials venal in this day of compulsory\nhonesty. But it's nothing new; I've met with similar occasions in my\nown Transplanet business, Locke.\"\n\nHe might have added that those occasions had been of his own devising\nand that they had brought him close more than once to a punitive\ntruth-check. The restraining threat of serum-and-psycho had kept him\nfor the greater part of his adult life in the ranks of the merely rich,\na potential industrial czar balked of financial empire by the necessity\nof maintaining a strictly legal status.\n\nLocke shook himself like a man waking out of nightmare.\n\n\"I'm glad I brought this problem to a man of your experience,\" he said\nfrankly. \"I've got great confidence in your judgment, Boyle, something\nI've learned partly from watching you handle Transplanet Enterprises\nand partly from talking with Moira.\"\n\nBoyle gave him a speculative look, feeling a return of his first acid\ncuriosity about Locke and Moira. \"I had no idea that Moira was so\nconfidential outside her marital-seven,\" he said dryly. \"She's not by\nany chance considering a _fourth_ husband, is she?\"\n\n\"Of course not. Moira's not _unconventional_. She's been kind to me a\nfew times, yes, but that's only her way of making a practical check\nagainst the future. After all, she's aware it can't be more than a\nmatter of--\"\n\nHe broke off, too embarrassed by his unintentional blunder to see the\nfury that discolored the older man's face.\n\nThe iron discipline that permitted Boyle to bring that fury under\ncontrol left him, even in his moment of outrage, with a sense of grim\npride. He was still master of himself and of Transplanet Enterprises.\nGiven fools enough like this to work with and time enough to use them,\nand he would be master of a great deal more. Immortality, for instance.\n\n\"She's quite right to be provident, of course,\" he said equably. \"I\n_am_ getting old. I'm past the sixty-mark, and it can't be more than\nanother year or two before the rejuvenators refuse me further privilege\nand I'm dropped from the marital lists for good.\"\n\n\"Damn it, Boyle, I'm sorry,\" Locke said. \"I didn't mean to offend you.\"\n\nThe potential awkwardness of the moment was relieved by a soft chime\nfrom the annunciator. The apartment entrance dilated, admitting Moira.\n\nShe came to them directly, slender and poised and supremely confident\nof her dark young beauty, her ermine wrap and high-coiled hair\nglistening with stray raindrops that took the light like diamonds. The\ntwo men stood up to greet her, and Boyle could not miss the subtle\nfeminine response of her to Locke's eager, athletic youth.\n\n_If she's planning to fill my place in her marital-seven with this\ncrewcut fool_, Boyle thought with sudden malice, _then she's in for a\nrude shock. And a final one._\n\n\"I couldn't enjoy a line of the play for thinking of you two patriots\nplotting here in my apartment,\" Moira said. \"But then the performance\nwas shatteringly dull, anyway.\"\n\nHer boredom was less than convincing. When she had hung her wrap in a\ncloset to be aerated and irradiated against its next wearing, she sat\nbetween Boyle and Locke with a little sigh of anticipation.\n\n\"Have you decided yet what to do about this dreadful immortality scheme\nof the Councils, darlings?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBoyle went to the auto-dispenser in a corner and brought back three\ndrinks, frosted and effervescing. They touched rims. Moira sipped at\nher glass quietly, waiting in tacit agreement with Locke for the older\nman's opinion.\n\n\"This longevity should be available to the Social Body as well as to\nAL&O,\" Boyle said. \"It's obvious even to non-politicals like Locke and\nmyself that, unless equal privilege is maintained, there's going to be\nthe devil to pay and the Weal will suffer. It's equally obvious that\nthe Alcorians' offer is made with the deliberate intent of undermining\nour system through dissension.\"\n\n\"To their own profit, of course,\" Locke put in. \"Divide and conquer....\"\n\n\"Whatever is to be done must be done quickly,\" Boyle said. \"It would\ntake months to negotiate a definitive plebiscite, and in that time the\nAlcorians would have gone home again without treating anyone outside\nAL&O. And there the matter would rest. It seems to be up to us to get\nhold of the longevity process ourselves and to broadcast it to the\npublic.\"\n\n\"The good of the Body is the preservation of the Weal,\" Locke said\nsententiously. \"What do you think, Moira?\"\n\nMoira touched her lips with a delicate pink tongue-tip, considering.\nTo Boyle, her process of thought was as open as a plain-talk teletape;\nimmortality for the Social Body automatically meant immortality for\nMoira and for David Locke. Both young, with an indefinite guarantee of\nlife....\n\n\"Yes,\" Moira said definitely. \"If some have it, then all should. But\nhow, Philip?\"\n\n\"You're both too young to remember this, of course,\" Boyle said,\n\"but until the 1980 Truth-check Act, there was a whole field of\ndeterminative action applicable to cases like this. It's a simple\nenough problem if we plan and execute it properly.\"\n\nHis confidence was not feigned; he had gone over the possibilities\nalready with the swift ruthlessness that had made him head of\nTransplanet Enterprises, and the prospect of direct action excited\nrather than dismayed him. Until now he had skirted the edges of\nillegality with painstaking care, never stepping quite over the line\nbeyond which he would be liable to the disastrous truth-check, but at\nthis moment he felt himself invincible, above retaliation.\n\n\"This present culture is a pragmatic compromise with necessity,\" Boyle\nsaid. \"It survives because it answers natural problems that couldn't\nbe solved under the old systems. Nationalism died out, for example,\nwhen we set up a universal government, because everyone belonged to the\nsame Social Body and had the same Weal to consider. Once we realized\nthat the good of the Body is more important than personal privacy, the\ntruth-check made ordinary crime and political machination obsolete.\nRacial antagonisms vanished under deliberate amalgamation. Monogamy\ngave way to the marital-seven, settling the problems of ego clash,\nincompatability, promiscuity and vice that existed before. It also\nsettled the disproportion between the male and female population.\n\n\"But stability is vulnerable. Since it never changes, it cannot\nstand against an attack either too new or too old for its immediate\nexperience. So if we're going after this Alcorian longevity process,\nI'd suggest that we choose a method so long out of date that there's no\nlonger a defense against it. _We'll take it by force!_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt amused him to see Moira and Locke accept his specious logic without\nreservation. Their directness was all but childlike. The thought of\nengaging personally in the sort of cloak-and-sword adventure carried\nover by the old twentieth-century melodrama tapes was, as he had\nsurmised, irresistible to them.\n\n\"I can see how you came to be head of Transplanet, Boyle,\" Locke said\nenviously. \"What's your plan, exactly?\"\n\n\"I've a cottage in the mountains that will serve as a base of\noperations,\" Boyle explained. \"Moira can wait there for us in the\nmorning while you and I take a 'copter to AL&O. According to your\ninformation, Cornelison and Bissell and Dorand will meet the Alcorians\nin the deliberations chamber at nine o'clock. We'll sleep-gas the lot\nof them, take the longevity process and go. There's no formal guard at\nAdministration, or anywhere else, nowadays. There'll be no possible way\nof tracing us.\"\n\n\"Unless we're truth-checked,\" Locke said doubtfully. \"If any one of us\nshould be pulled in for serum-and-psycho, the whole affair will come\nout. The Board of Order--\"\n\n\"Order won't know whom to suspect,\" Boyle said patiently. \"And they\ncan't possibly check the whole city. They'd have no way of knowing\neven that it was someone from this locale. It could be anyone, from\nanywhere.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Locke had gone and Moira had exhausted her fund of excited\nsmall talk, Boyle went over the entire plan again from inception to\nconclusion. Lying awake in the darkness with only the sound of Moira's\neven breathing breaking the stillness, he let his practical fancy run\nahead.\n\nYears, decades, generations--what were they? To be by relative\nstandards undying in a world of ephemerae, with literally nothing that\nhe might not have or do....\n\nHe dreamed a dream as old as man, of stretching today into forever.\n\nImmortality.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe coup next morning was no more difficult, though bloodier, than\nBoyle had anticipated.\n\nAt nine sharp, he left David Locke at the controls of his helicar on\nthe sun-bright roof landing of AL&O, took a self-service elevator\ndown four floors and walked calmly to the deliberation chamber where\nAdministrative Council met with the visitors from Alcor. He was armed\nfor any eventuality with an electronic freeze-gun, a sleep-capsule of\nanesthetic gas, and a nut-sized incendiary bomb capable of setting\nafire an ordinary building.\n\nHis first hope of surprising the Council in conference was dashed\nin the antechamber, rendering his sleep-bomb useless. Dorand was a\nmoment late; he came in almost on Boyle's heels, his face blank with\nastonishment at finding an intruder ahead of him.\n\nThe freeze-gun gave him no time for questions.\n\n\"Quiet,\" Boyle ordered, and drove the startled Councilor ahead of him\ninto the deliberations chamber.\n\nHe was just in time. Cornelison had one bony arm already bared for the\nlongevity injection; Bissell sat in tense anticipation of his elder's\nreaction; the Alcorian, Fermiirig, stood at Cornelison's side with a\nglittering hypodermic needle in one of his four three-fingered hands.\n\nFor the moment, a sudden chill of apprehension touched Boyle. There\nshould have been _two_ Alcorians.\n\n\"Quiet,\" Boyle said again, this time to the group. \"You, Fermiirig,\nwhere is your mate?\"\n\nThe Alcorian replaced the hypodermic needle carefully in its case, his\ntriangular face totally free of any identifiable emotion and clasped\nboth primary and secondary sets of hands together as an Earthman might\nhave raised them overhead. His eyes, doe-soft and gentle, considered\nBoyle thoughtfully.\n\n\"Santikh is busy with other matters,\" Fermiirig said. His voice was\nthin and reedy, precise of enunciation, but hissing faintly on the\naspirants. \"I am to join her later--\" his gentle eyes went to the\nCouncilors, gauging the gravity of the situation from their tensity,\nand returned to Boyle--\"if I am permitted.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Boyle said.\n\nHe snapped the serum case shut and tucked it under his arm, turning\ntoward the open balcony windows. \"You're coming with me, Fermiirig. You\nothers stay as you are.\"\n\nThe soft drone of a helicar descending outside told him that Locke had\ntimed his descent accurately. Cornelison chose that moment to protest,\nhis wrinkled face tight with consternation at what he read of Boyle's\nintention.\n\n\"We know you, Boyle! You can't possibly escape. The Ordermen--\"\n\nBoyle laughed at him.\n\n\"There'll be no culprit for the Ordermen,\" he said, \"nor any\nwitnesses. You've wiped out ordinary crime with your truth-checks and\npracticalities, Cornelison, but you've made the way easier for a man\nwho knows what he wants.\"\n\nHe pressed the firing stud of his weapon. Cornelison fell and lay\nstiffly on the pastel tile. Bissell and Dorand went down as quickly,\nfrozen to temporary rigidity.\n\nBoyle tossed his incendiary into the huddle of still bodies and shoved\nthe Alcorian forcibly through the windows into the hovering aircar.\n\nLocke greeted the alien's appearance with stark amazement. \"My God,\nBoyle, are you _mad_? You can't kidnap--\"\n\nThe dull shock of explosion inside the deliberations chamber jarred the\nhelicar, throwing the slighter Alcorian to the floor and staggering\nBoyle briefly.\n\n\"Get us out of here,\" Boyle said sharply. He turned the freeze-gun on\nthe astounded Locke, half expecting resistance and fully prepared to\nmeet it. \"You fool, do you think I'm still playing the childish game I\nmade up to keep you and Moira quiet?\"\n\nA pall of greasy black smoke poured after them when Locke, still\nstunned by the suddenness of catastrophe, put the aircar into motion\nand streaked away across the city.\n\nBoyle, watching the first red tongue of flame lick out from the\nbuilding behind, patted the serum case and set himself for the next\nstep.\n\nImmortality.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLocke took the helicar down through the mountains, skirting a clear\nswift river that broke into tumultuous falls a hundred yards below\nBoyle's cottage, and set it down in a flagstone court.\n\n\"Out,\" Boyle ordered.\n\nMoira met them in the spacious living room, her pretty face comical\nwith surprise and dismay.\n\n\"Philip, what's _happened_? You look so--\"\n\nShe saw the alien then and put a hand to her mouth.\n\n\"Keep her quiet while I deal with Fermiirig,\" Boyle said to Locke. \"I\nhave no time for argument. If either of you gives me any trouble....\"\n\nHe left the threat to Locke's stunned fancy and turned on the Alcorian.\n\n\"Let me have the injection you had ready for Cornelison. Now.\"\n\nThe Alcorian moved his narrow shoulders in what might have been a\nshrug. \"You are making a mistake. You are not fitted for life beyond\nthe normal span.\"\n\n\"I didn't bring you here to moralize,\" Boyle said. \"If you mean to see\nyour mate again, Fermiirig, give me the injection!\"\n\n\"There was a time in your history when force was justifiable,\"\nFermiirig said. \"But that time is gone. You are determined?\" He shook\nhis head soberly when Boyle did not answer. \"I was afraid so.\"\n\nHe took the hypodermic needle out of its case, squeezed out a pale drop\nof liquid and slid the point into the exposed vein of Boyle's forearm.\n\nBoyle, watching the slow depression of the plunger, asked: \"How long a\nperiod will this guarantee, in Earth time?\"\n\n\"Seven hundred years,\" Fermiirig said. He withdrew the instrument and\nreplaced it in its case, his liquid glance following Boyle's rising\ngesture with the freeze-gun. \"At the end of that time, the treatment\nmay be renewed if facilities are available.\"\n\n_Immortality!_\n\n\"Then I won't need you any more,\" Boyle said, and rayed him down. \"Nor\nthese other two.\"\n\nLocke, characteristically, sprang up and tried to shield Moira with\nhis own body. \"Boyle, what are you thinking of? You can't murder us\nwithout--\"\n\n\"There's a very effective rapids a hundred yards down river,\" Boyle\nsaid. \"You'll both be quite satisfactorily dead after going through\nit, I think. Possibly unrecognizable, too, though that doesn't matter\nparticularly.\"\n\nHe was pressing the firing stud, slowly because something in the\ntension of the moment appealed to the sadism in his nature, when an\nOrderman's freeze-beam caught him from behind and dropped him stiffly\nbeside Fermiirig.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe details of his failure reached him later in his cell,\nanticlimactically, through a fat and pimply jailer inflated to bursting\nwith the importance of guarding the first murderer in his generation.\n\n\"AL&O kept this quiet until the Council killing,\" the turnkey said,\n\"but it had to come out when the Board of Order went after you. The\nAlcorians are telepathic. Santikh led the Ordermen to your place in the\nmountains. Fermiirig guided her.\"\n\nHe grinned vacuously at his prisoner, visibly pleased to impart\ninformation. \"Lucky for you we don't have capital punishment any more.\nAs it is, you'll get maximum, but they can't give you more than life.\"\n\nLucky? The realization of what lay ahead of him stunned Boyle with a\nslow and dreadful certainty.\n\nA sentence of life.\n\nSeven hundred years.\n\nNot immortality--\n\nEternity.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Today is Forever, by Roger Dee\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TODAY IS FOREVER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 50884.txt or 50884.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/0/8/8/50884/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
