E. Smith, Philip Francis Nowlan, Fletcher Pratt and Miles J.\nBreuer), that Jack Williamson barely managed to become one of a\ndistinguished group of discoveries by stealing the cover of the December\nissue for his first story_ The Metal Man.\n\n_A disciple of A. Merritt, he attempted to imitate in style, mood and\nsubject the magic of that late lamented master of fantasy. The imitation\nfound great favor from the readership and almost instantly Jack\nWilliamson became an important name on the contents page of_ AMAZING\nSTORIES. _He followed his initial success with two short novels_, The\nGreen Girl _in_ AMAZING STORIES _and_ The Alien Intelligence _in_\nSCIENCE WONDER STORIES, _another Gernsback publication. Both of these\nstories were close copies of A. Merritt, whose style and method Jack\nWilliamson parlayed into popularity for eight years._\n\n_Yet the strange thing about it was that Jack Williamson was one of the\nmost versatile science fiction authors ever to sit down at the\ntypewriter. When the vogue for science-fantasy altered to super science,\nhe created the memorable super lock-picker Giles Habilula as the major\nattraction in a rousing trio of space operas_, The Legion of Space, The\nCometeers _and_ One Against the Legion. _When grim realism was the order\nof the day, he produced_ Crucible of Power _and when they wanted\nextrapolated theory in present tense, he assumed the disguise of Will\nStewart and popularized the concept of contra terrene matter in science\nfiction with_ Seetee Ship _and_ Seetee Shock. _Finally, when only\npsychological studies of the future would do, he produced_ \"With Folded\nHands ...\" \"... And Searching Mind.\"\n\nThe Cosmic Express _is of special interest because it was written during\nWilliamson's A. Merritt \"kick,\" when he was writing little else but, and\nit gave the earliest indication of a more general capability. The\nlightness of the handling is especially modern, barely avoiding the\nfarcical by the validity of the notion that wireless transmission of\nmatter is the next big transportation frontier to be conquered. It is\nespecially important because it stylistically forecast a later trend to\naccept the background for granted, regardless of the quantity of\nwonders, and proceed with the story. With only a few thousand\nscanning-disk television sets in existence at the time of the writing,\nthe surmise that this media would be a natural for westerns was\nparticularly astute._\n\n_Jack Williamson was born in 1908 in the Arizona territory when covered\nwagons were the primary form of transportation and apaches still raided\nthe settlers. His father was a cattle man, but for young Jack, the ranch\nwas anything but glamorous. \"My days were filled,\" he remembers, \"with\nmonotonous rounds of what seemed an endless, heart-breaking war with\ndrought and frost and dust-storms, poison-weeds and hail, for the sake\nof survival on the_ Llano Estacado.\" _The discovery of_ AMAZING STORIES\n_was the escape he sought and his goal was to be a science fiction\nwriter. He labored to this end and the first he knew that a story of his\nhad been accepted was when he bought the December, 1929 issue of_\nAMAZING STORIES. _Since then, he has written millions of words of\nscience fiction and has gone on record as follows: \"I feel that\nscience-fiction is the folklore of the new world of science, and the\nexpression of man's reaction to a technological environment. By which I\nmean that it is the most interesting and stimulating form of literature\ntoday.\"_\n\n\n\n\nMr. Eric Stokes-Harding tumbled out of the rumpled bed-clothing, a\nstriking slender figure in purple-striped pajamas. He smiled fondly\nacross to the other of the twin beds, where Nada, his pretty bride, lay\nquiet beneath light silk covers. With a groan, he stood up and began a\nseries of fantastic bending exercises. But after a few half-hearted\nmovements, he gave it up, and walked through an open door into a small\nbright room, its walls covered with bookcases and also with scientific\nappliances that would have been strange to the man of four or five\ncenturies before, when the Age of Aviation was beginning.\n\nYawning, Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding stood before the great open window,\nstaring out. Below him was a wide, park-like space, green with emerald\nlawns, and bright with flowering plants. Two hundred yards across it\nrose an immense pyramidal building--an artistic structure, gleaming with\nwhite marble and bright metal, striped with the verdure of terraced\nroof-gardens, its slender peak rising to help support the gray,\nsteel-ribbed glass roof above. Beyond, the park stretched away in\nillimitable vistas, broken with the graceful columned buildings that\nheld up the great glass roof.\n\n[Illustration: Suddenly there was a sharp tingling sensation where they\ntouched the polished surface.]\n\nAbove the glass, over this New York of 2432 A. D., a freezing blizzard\nwas sweeping. But small concern was that to the lightly clad man at the\nwindow, who was inhaling deeply the fragrant air from the plants\nbelow--air kept, winter and summer, exactly at 20\u00b0 C.\n\nWith another yawn, Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding turned back to the room,\nwhich was bright with the rich golden light that poured in from the\nsuspended globes of the cold ato-light that illuminated the snow-covered\ncity. With a distasteful grimace, he seated himself before a broad,\npaper-littered desk, sat a few minutes leaning back, with his hands\nclasped behind his head. At last he straightened reluctantly, slid a\nsmall typewriter out of its drawer, and began pecking at it impatiently.\n\nFor Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding was an author. There was a whole shelf of\nhis books on the wall, in bright jackets, red and blue and green, that\nbrought a thrill of pleasure to the young novelist's heart when he\nlooked up from his clattering machine.\n\nHe wrote \"thrilling action romances,\" as his enthusiastic publishers and\ntelevision directors said, \"of ages past, when men were men. Red-blooded\nheroes responding vigorously to the stirring passions of primordial\nlife!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was impartial as to the source of his thrills--provided they were\ndistant enough from modern civilization. His hero was likely to be an\nape-man roaring through the jungle, with a bloody rock in one hand and a\nbeautiful girl in the other. Or a cowboy, \"hard-riding, hard-shooting,\"\nthe vanishing hero of the ancient ranches. Or a man marooned with a\nlovely woman on a desert South Sea island. His heroes were invariably\nstrong, fearless, resourceful fellows, who could handle a club on equal\nterms with a cave-man, or call science to aid them in defending a\nbeautiful mate from the terrors of a desolate wilderness.\n\nAnd a hundred million read Eric's novels, and watched the dramatization\nof them on the television screens. They thrilled at the simple, romantic\nlives his heroes led, paid him handsome royalties, and subconsciously\nshared his opinion that civilization had taken all the best from the\nlife of man.\n\nEric had settled down to the artistic satisfaction of describing the\nsensuous delight of his hero in the roasted marrow-bones of a dead\nmammoth, when the pretty woman in the other room stirred, and presently\ncame tripping into the study, gay and vivacious, and--as her husband of\na few months most justly thought--altogether beautiful in a bright silk\ndressing gown.\n\nRecklessly, he slammed the machine back into its place, and resolved to\nforget that his next \"red-blooded action thriller\" was due in the\npublisher's office at the end of the month. He sprang up to kiss his\nwife, held her embraced for a long happy moment. And then they went hand\nin hand, to the side of the room and punched a series of buttons on a\npanel--a simple way of ordering breakfast sent up the automatic shaft\nfrom the kitchens below.\n\nNada Stokes-Harding was also an author. She wrote poems--\"back to nature\nstuff\"--simple lyrics of the sea, of sunsets, of bird songs, of bright\nflowers and warm winds, of thrilling communion with Nature, and growing\nthings. Men read her poems and called her a genius. Even though the\nwhole world had grown up into a city, the birds were extinct, there were\nno wild flowers, and no one had time to bother about sunsets.\n\n\"Eric, darling,\" she said, \"isn't it terrible to be cooped up here in\nthis little flat, away from the things we both love?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear. Civilization has ruined the world. If we could only have\nlived a thousand years ago, when life was simple and natural, when men\nhunted and killed their meat, instead of drinking synthetic stuff, when\nmen still had the joys of conflict, instead of living under glass, like\nhot-house flowers.\"\n\n\"If we could only go somewhere--\"\n\n\"There isn't anywhere to go. I write about the West, Africa, South Sea\nIslands. But they were all filled up two hundred years ago. Pleasure\nresorts, sanatoriums, cities, factories.\"\n\n\"If only we lived on Venus! I was listening to a lecture on the\ntelevision, last night. The speaker said that the Planet Venus is\nyounger than the Earth, that it has not cooled so much. It has a thick,\ncloudy atmosphere, and low, rainy forests. There's simple, elemental\nlife there--like Earth had before civilization ruined it.\"\n\n\"Yes, Kinsley, with his new infra-red ray telescope, that penetrates the\ncloud layers of the planet, proved that Venus rotates in about the same\nperiod as Earth; and it must be much like Earth was a million years\nago.\"\n\n\"Eric, I wonder if we could go there! It would be so thrilling to begin\nlife like the characters in your stories, to get away from this hateful\ncivilization, and live natural lives. Maybe a rocket--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe young author's eyes were glowing. He skipped across the floor,\nseized Nada, kissed her ecstatically. \"Splendid! Think of hunting in the\nvirgin forest, and bringing the game home to you! But I'm afraid there\nis no way.--Wait! The Cosmic Express.\"\n\n\"The Cosmic Express?\"\n\n\"A new invention. Just perfected a few weeks ago, I understand. By\nLudwig Von der Valls, the German physicist.\"\n\n\"I've quit bothering about science. It has ruined nature, filled the\nworld with silly, artificial people, doing silly, artificial things.\"\n\n\"But this is quite remarkable, dear. A new way to travel--by ether!\"\n\n\"By ether!\"\n\n\"Yes. You know of course that energy and matter are interchangeable\nterms; both are simply etheric vibration, of different sorts.\"\n\n\"Of course. That's elementary.\" She smiled proudly. \"I can give you\nexamples, even of the change. The disintegration of the radium atom,\nmaking helium and lead and _energy_. And Millikan's old proof that his\nCosmic Ray is generated when particles of electricity are united to form\nan atom.\"\n\n\"Fine! I thought you said you weren't a scientist.\" He glowed with\npride. \"But the method, in the new Cosmic Express, is simply to convert\nthe matter to be carried into power, send it out as a radiant beam and\nfocus the beam to convert it back into atoms at the destination.\"\n\n\"But the amount of energy must be terrific--\"\n\n\"It is. You know short waves carry more energy than long ones. The\nExpress Ray is an electromagnetic vibration of frequency far higher than\nthat of even the Cosmic Ray, and correspondingly more powerful and more\npenetrating.\"\n\nThe girl frowned, running slim fingers through golden-brown hair. \"But I\ndon't see how they get any recognizable object, not even how they get\nthe radiation turned back into matter.\"\n\n\"The beam is focused, just like the light that passes through a camera\nlens. The photographic lens, using light rays, picks up a picture and\nreproduces it again on the plate--just the same as the Express Ray picks\nup an object and sets it down on the other side of the world.\n\n\"An analogy from television might help. You know that by means of the\nscanning disc, the picture is transformed into mere rapid fluctuations\nin the brightness of a beam of light. In a parallel manner, the focal\nplane of the Express Ray moves slowly through the object, progressively,\ndissolving layers of the thickness of a single atom, which are\naccurately reproduced at the other focus of the instrument--which might\nbe in Venus!\n\n\"But the analogy of the lens is the better of the two. For no receiving\ninstrument is required, as in television. The object is built up of an\ninfinite series of plane layers, at the focus of the ray, no matter\nwhere that may be. Such a thing would be impossible with radio apparatus\nbecause even with the best beam transmission, all but a tiny fraction of\nthe power is lost, and power is required to rebuild the atoms. Do you\nunderstand, dear?\"\n\n\"Not altogether. But I should worry! Here comes breakfast. Let me butter\nyour toast.\"\n\nA bell had rung at the shaft. She ran to it, and returned with a great\nsilver tray, laden with dainty dishes, which she set on a little side\ntable. They sat down opposite each other, and ate, getting as much\nsatisfaction from contemplation of each other's faces as from the\nexcellent food. When they had finished, she carried the tray to the\nshaft, slid it in a slot, and touched a button--thus disposing of the\nculinary cares of the morning.\n\nShe ran back to Eric, who was once more staring distastefully at his\ntypewriter.\n\n\"Oh, darling! I'm thrilled to death about the Cosmic Express! If we\ncould go to Venus, to a new life on a new world, and get away from all\nthis hateful conventional society--\"\n\n\"We can go to their office--it's only five minutes. The chap that\noperates the machine for the company is a pal of mine. He's not supposed\nto take passengers except between the offices they have scattered about\nthe world. But I know his weak point--\"\n\nEric laughed, fumbled with a hidden spring under his desk. A small\npolished object, gleaming silvery, slid down into his hand.\n\n\"Old friendship, _plus_ this, would make him--like spinach.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFive minutes later Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding and his pretty wife were in\nstreet clothes, light silk tunics of loose, flowing lines--little\nclothing being required in the artificially warmed city. They entered an\nelevator and dropped thirty stories to the ground floor of the great\nbuilding.\n\nThere they entered a cylindrical car, with rows of seats down the sides.\nNot greatly different from an ancient subway car, except that it was\nair-tight, and was hurled by magnetic attraction and repulsion through a\ntube exhausted of air, at a speed that would have made an old subway\nrider gasp with amazement.\n\nIn five more minutes their car had whipped up to the base of another\nbuilding, in the business section, where there was no room for parks\nbetween the mighty structures that held the unbroken glass roofs two\nhundred stories above the concrete pavement.\n\nAn elevator brought them up a hundred and fifty stories. Eric led Nada\ndown a long, carpeted corridor to a wide glass door, which bore the\nwords:\n\n                             COSMIC EXPRESS\n\nstenciled in gold capitals across it.\n\nAs they approached, a lean man, carrying a black bag, darted out of an\nelevator shaft opposite the door, ran across the corridor, and entered.\nThey pushed in after him.\n\nThey were in a little room, cut in two by a high brass grill. In front\nof it was a long bench against the wall, that reminded one of the\nwaiting room in an old railroad depot. In the grill was a little window,\nwith a lazy, brown-eyed youth leaning on the shelf behind it. Beyond him\nwas a great, glittering piece of mechanism, half hidden by the brass. A\nlittle door gave access to the machine from the space before the grill.\n\nThe thin man in black, whom Eric now recognized as a prominent French\nheart-specialist, was dancing before the window, waving his bag\nfrantically, raving at the sleepy boy.\n\n\"Queek! I have tell you zee truth! I have zee most urgent necessity to\ngo queekly. A patient I have in Paree, zat ees in zee most creetical\ncondition!\"\n\n\"Hold your horses just a minute, Mister. We got a client in the machine\nnow. Russian diplomat from Moscow to Rio de Janeiro.... Two hundred\nseventy dollars and eighty cents, please.... Your turn next. Remember\nthis is just an experimental service. Regular installations all over the\nworld in a year.... Ready now. Come on in.\"\n\nThe youth took the money, pressed a button. The door sprang open in the\ngrill, and the frantic physician leaped through it.\n\n\"Lie down on the crystal, face up,\" the young man ordered. \"Hands at\nyour sides, don't breathe. Ready!\"\n\nHe manipulated his dials and switches, and pressed another button.\n\n\"Why, hello, Eric, old man!\" he cried. \"That's the lady you were telling\nme about? Congratulations!\" A bell jangled before him on the panel.\n\"Just a minute. I've got a call.\"\n\nHe punched the board again. Little bulbs lit and glowed for a second.\nThe youth turned toward the half-hidden machine, spoke courteously.\n\n\"All right, madam. Walk out. Hope you found the transit pleasant.\"\n\n\"But my Violet! My precious Violet!\" a shrill female voice came from\nthe machine. \"Sir, what have you done with my darling Violet?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know, madam. You lost it off your hat?\"\n\n\"None of your impertinence, sir! I want my dog.\"\n\n\"Ah, a dog. Must have jumped off the crystal. You can have him sent on\nfor three hundred and--\"\n\n\"Young man, if any harm comes to my Violet--I'll--I'll--I'll appeal to\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals!\"\n\n\"Very good, madam. We appreciate your patronage.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe door flew open again. A very fat woman, puffing angrily, face highly\ncolored, clothing shimmering with artificial gems, waddled pompously out\nof the door through which the frantic French doctor had so recently\nvanished. She rolled heavily across the room, and out into the corridor.\nShrill words floated back:\n\n\"I'm going to see my lawyer! My precious Violet--\"\n\nThe sallow youth winked. \"And now what can I do for you, Eric?\"\n\n\"We want to go to Venus, if that ray of yours can put us there.\"\n\n\"To Venus? Impossible. My orders are to use the Express merely between\nthe sixteen designated stations, at New York, San Francisco, Tokyo,\nLondon, Paris--\"\n\n\"See here, Charley,\" with a cautious glance toward the door, Eric held\nup the silver flask. \"For old time's sake, and for this--\"\n\nThe boy seemed dazed at sight of the bright flask. Then, with a single\nswift motion, he snatched it out of Eric's hand, and bent to conceal it\nbelow his instrument panel.\n\n\"Sure, old boy. I'd send you to heaven for that, if you'd give me the\nmicrometer readings to set the ray with. But I tell you, this is\ndangerous. I've got a sort of television attachment, for focusing the\nray. I can turn that on Venus--I've been amusing myself, watching the\nlife there, already. Terrible place. Savage. I can pick a place on high\nland to set you down. But I can't be responsible for what happens\nafterward.\"\n\n\"Simple, primitive life is what we're looking for. And now what do I owe\nyou--\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right. Between friends. Provided that stuff's genuine!\nWalk in and lie down on the crystal block. Hands at your sides. Don't\nmove.\"\n\nThe little door had swung open again, and Eric led Nada through. They\nstepped into a little cell, completely surrounded with mirrors and vast\nprisms and lenses and electron tubes. In the center was a slab of\ntransparent crystal, eight feet square and two inches thick, with an\nintricate mass of machinery below it.\n\nEric helped Nada to a place on the crystal, lay down at her side.\n\n\"I think the Express Ray is focused just at the surface of the crystal,\nfrom below,\" he said. \"It dissolves our substance, to be transmitted by\nthe beam. It would look as if we were melting into the crystal.\"\n\n\"Ready,\" called the youth. \"Think I've got it for you. Sort of a high\nisland in the jungle. Nothing bad in sight now. But, I say--how're you\ncoming back? I haven't got time to watch you.\"\n\n\"Go ahead. We aren't coming back.\"\n\n\"Gee! What is it? Elopement? I thought you were married already. Or is\nit business difficulties? The Bears did make an awful raid last night.\nBut you better let me set you down in Hong Kong.\"\n\nA bell jangled. \"So long,\" the youth called.\n\nNada and Eric felt themselves enveloped in fire. Sheets of white flame\nseemed to lap up about them from the crystal block. Suddenly there was a\nsharp tingling sensation where they touched the polished surface. Then\nblackness, blankness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next thing they knew, the fires were gone from about them. They were\nlying in something extremely soft and fluid; and warm rain was beating\nin their faces. Eric sat up, found himself in a mud-puddle. Beside him\nwas Nada, opening her eyes and struggling up, her bright garments\nstained with black mud.\n\nAll about rose a thick jungle, dark and gloomy--and very wet. Palm-like,\nthe gigantic trees were, or fern-like, flinging clouds of feathery green\nfoliage high against a somber sky of unbroken gloom.\n\nThey stood up, triumphant.\n\n\"At last!\" Nada cried. \"We're free! Free of that hateful old\ncivilization! We're back to Nature!\"\n\n\"Yes, we're on our feet now, not parasites on the machines.\"\n\n\"It's wonderful to have a fine, strong man like you to trust in, Eric.\nYou're just like one of the heroes in your books!\"\n\n\"You're the perfect companion, Nada.... But now we must be practical. We\nmust build a fire, find weapons, set up a shelter of some kind. I guess\nit will be night, pretty soon. And Charley said something about savage\nanimals he had seen in the television.\n\n\"We'll find a nice dry cave, and have a fire in front of the door. And\nskins of animals to sleep on. And pottery vessels to cook in. And you\nwill find seeds and grown grain.\"\n\n\"But first we must find a flint-bed. We need flint for tools, and to\nstrike sparks to make a fire with. We will probably come across a chunk\nof virgin copper, too--it's found native.\"\n\nPresently they set off through the jungle. The mud seemed to be very\nabundant, and of a most sticky consistence. They sank into it ankle deep\nat every step, and vast masses of it clung to their feet. A mile they\nstruggled on, without finding where a provident nature had left them\neven a single fragment of quartz, to say nothing of a mass of pure\ncopper.\n\n\"A darned shame,\" Eric grumbled, \"to come forty million miles, and meet\nsuch a reception as this!\"\n\nNada stopped. \"Eric,\" she said, \"I'm tired. And I don't believe there's\nany rock here, anyway. You'll have to use wooden tools, sharpened in the\nfire.\"\n\n\"Probably you're right. This soil seemed to be of alluvial origin.\nShouldn't be surprised if the native rock is some hundreds of feet\nunderground. Your idea is better.\"\n\n\"You can make a fire by rubbing sticks together, can't you?\"\n\n\"It can be done, I'm sure. I've never tried it, myself. We need some dry\nsticks, first.\"\n\nThey resumed the weary march, with a good fraction of the new planet\nadhering to their feet. Rain was still falling from the dark heavens in\na steady, warm downpour. Dry wood seemed scarce as the proverbial hen's\nteeth.\n\n\"You didn't bring any matches, dear?\"\n\n\"Matches! Of course not! We're going back to Nature.\"\n\n\"I hope we get a fire pretty soon.\"\n\n\"If dry wood were gold dust, we couldn't buy a hot dog.\"\n\n\"Eric, that reminds me that I'm hungry.\"\n\nHe confessed to a few pangs of his own. They turned their attention to\nlooking for banana trees, and coconut palms, but they did not seem to\nabound in the Venerian jungle. Even small animals that might have been\nslain with a broken branch had contrary ideas about the matter.\n\nAt last, from sheer weariness, they stopped, and gathered branches to\nmake a sloping shelter by a vast fallen tree-trunk.\n\n\"This will keep out the rain--maybe--\" Eric said hopefully. \"And\ntomorrow, when it has quit raining--I'm sure we'll do better.\"\n\nThey crept in, as gloomy night fell without. They lay in each other's\narms, the body warmth oddly comforting. Nada cried a little.\n\n\"Buck up,\" Eric advised her. \"We're back to nature--where we've always\nwanted to be.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the darkness, the temperature fell somewhat, and a high wind rose,\nwhipping cold rain into the little shelter, and threatening to demolish\nit. Swarms of mosquito-like insects, seemingly not inconvenienced in the\nleast by the inclement elements, swarmed about them in clouds.\n\nThen came a sound from the dismal stormy night, a hoarse, bellowing\nroar, raucous, terrifying.\n\nNada clung against Eric. \"What is it, dear?\" she chattered.\n\n\"Must be a reptile. Dinosaur, or something of the sort. This world seems\nto be in about the same state as the Earth when they flourished\nthere.... But maybe it won't find us.\"\n\nThe roar was repeated, nearer. The earth trembled beneath a mighty\ntread.\n\n\"Eric,\" a thin voice trembled. \"Don't you think--it might have been\nbetter-- You know the old life was not so bad, after all.\"\n\n\"I was just thinking of our rooms, nice and warm and bright, with hot\nfoods coming up the shaft whenever we pushed the button, and the gay\ncrowds in the park, and my old typewriter.\"\n\n\"Eric?\" she called softly.\n\n\"Yes, dear.\"\n\n\"Don't you wish--we had known better?\"\n\n\"I do.\" If he winced at the \"we\" the girl did not notice.\n\nThe roaring outside was closer. And suddenly it was answered by another\nraucous bellow, at considerable distance, that echoed strangely through\nthe forest. The fearful sounds were repeated, alternately. And always\nthe more distant seemed nearer, until the two sounds were together.\n\nAnd then an infernal din broke out in the darkness. Bellows. Screams.\nDeafening shrieks. Mighty splashes, as if struggling Titans had upset\noceans. Thunderous crashes, as if they were demolishing forests.\n\nEric and Nada clung to each other, in doubt whether to stay or to fly\nthrough the storm. Gradually the sound of the conflict came nearer,\nuntil the earth shook beneath them, and they were afraid to move.\n\nSuddenly the great fallen tree against which they had erected the flimsy\nshelter was rolled back, evidently by a chance blow from the invisible\nmonsters. The pitiful roof collapsed on the bedraggled humans. Nada\nburst into tears.\n\n\"Oh, if only--if only--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly flame lapped up about them, the same white fire they had seen\nas they lay on the crystal block. Dizziness, insensibility overcame\nthem. A few moments later, they were lying on the transparent table in\nthe Cosmic Express office, with all those great mirrors and prisms and\nlenses about them.\n\nA bustling, red-faced official appeared through the door in the grill,\nfairly bubbling apologies.\n\n\"So sorry--an accident--inconceivable. I can't see how he got it! We got\nyou back as soon as we could find a focus. I sincerely hope you haven't\nbeen injured.\"\n\n\"Why--what--what--\"\n\n\"Why I happened in, found our operator drunk. I've no idea where he got\nthe stuff. He muttered something about Venus. I consulted the\nauto-register, and found two more passengers registered here than had\nbeen recorded at our other stations. I looked up the duplicate beam\ncoordinates, and found that it had been set on Venus. I got men on the\ntelevision at once, and we happened to find you.\n\n\"I can't imagine how it happened. I've had the fellow locked up, and\nthe 'dry-laws' are on the job. I hope you won't hold us for excessive\ndamages.\"\n\n\"No, I ask nothing except that you don't press charges against the boy.\nI don't want him to suffer for it in any way. My wife and I will be\nperfectly satisfied to get back to our apartment.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder. You look like you've been through--I don't know what.\nBut I'll have you there in five minutes. My private car--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Eric Stokes-Harding, noted author of primitive life and love, ate a\nhearty meal with his pretty spouse, after they had washed off the grime\nof another planet. He spent the next twelve hours in bed.\n\nAt the end of the month he delivered his promised story to his\npublishers, a thrilling tale of a man marooned on Venus, with a\nbeautiful girl. The hero made stone tools, erected a dwelling for\nhimself and his mate, hunted food for her, defended her from the mammoth\nsaurian monsters of the Venerian jungles.\n\nThe book was a huge success.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Cosmic Express, by John Stewart Williamson\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE COSMIC EXPRESS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 26066-8.txt or 26066-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/6/0/6/26066/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Stephen Blundell and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
