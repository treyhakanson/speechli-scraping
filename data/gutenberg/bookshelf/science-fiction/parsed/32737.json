His rescuers seemed to disagree, however--until Chet learned his\nlesson too!_]\n\n\nIn the village clearing, under the diffuse red sun of Hedlot, Chet\nBarfield listened intently. Mostly he heard the villagers, the Agvars,\nnoisy with the disregard for sound that comes of defective hearing.\n\nBut above their clamor was another note. No ... Yes! There it was\nagain--the swish-roar-scream of a spaceship!\n\nChet's heart lifted to the altitude of that ship. Rescue! Rescue was at\nhand for him, after three years as a prisoner.\n\nThought of it momentarily overcame the passivity that years of\nstarvation had made his habit. He even forgot himself enough to walk\nerect a few steps, staring skyward--heavenward!--within cupped hands.\n\nBut the dense hardwood chain on his ankle brought him up short. When it\ntightened, he remembered, and slouched to all fours again, moving with\nthe gorilla-like gait of the Agvars toward the unshaded post he was\nchained to.\n\nHe'd been observed. Pawfulls of dirt stung his bent and whip-scarred\nback, and a treble chorus stung his ears and nerves. The village boys\nwere chanting derisively. Chet had never been able to learn the\nlanguage, but the tone of voice was unmistakable.\n\nHe huddled against the post, knees to chin, hands clasped around his\nmatted hair, awaiting the inevitable sticks and slops. He heard the\nchildren's voices fade as they scattered throughout the village of\nhaphazard lean-tos in search of especially sickening things to throw.\nFor a few minutes, then, he'd have a breather. But not for long--they\nwouldn't forget....\n\nNo. But the fellows hadn't forgotten him, either. He could stand this\nfor a day or two more. A week or a month, even. It didn't matter. This\nwould end--soon.\n\nHis turn would come! He'd make these devils suffer as he had suffered.\nHe swore it!\n\nHe was glad he'd stayed alive for this. It had been a fight to live, a\nstruggle he'd often thought futile while he made it. Learning to eat\nwhatever he could get, training himself to breathe the local atmosphere\nin the special rhythm its composition required, accepting degradations\ntoo cruel for a captive animal, avoiding the resistance that would have\nbrought merciful murder.... All that, yet it felt strange, now, to be so\nglad he was alive.\n\nHe heard the children returning, and crouched lower. A few clots of\ngarbage spattered against the post--teasers, to make him angry, so he'd\nturn to howl his rage, and offer his face as a target.\n\nGood memories, these little beasts had. It was almost a year since he'd\nlast done that....\n\nWell, he had a memory, too. And while they pelted him--from fairly close\nrange, now, with sharp rocks among the wads of filth--he could take\nrefuge in the memory of those last glorious days on Earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRemembrance was itself a change brought by the roaring ship; usually he\nmoped in a vegetative daze. But now he recalled how he'd looked in the\ntight white uniform: six feet of well-fed muscle accentuated by the\ngarment's lines, the blue stars on each lapel just matching his eyes,\nthe peak of his cap harmonizing with the straight line of his jaw.\n\nHe remembered how he'd sounded, speaking words of nonchalant and unfelt\nmodesty in the soft Southern voice the girls had liked so well. He could\nhave had his pick of girls. He'd been a picked man himself.\n\nHighly selected--that was the phrase. He was highly selected, Chet\nreminded himself, shrinking as the children came closer and their\nmissiles began to really hurt.\n\nHe'd been highly selected since his eighteenth year. At 25 he'd had\nseven years of pre-flight training--seven years of indoctrination\nspecifically designed to give him self-confidence enough to face the\nvoid itself without flinching.\n\nNow he flinched from children.... Still, the schooling had worked, he\nacknowledged--so well that when their ship crashed into this planet\nHedlot's salty sea, his first reaction had been indignation at the\nelements.\n\nHis second thought had been for his comrades. But they went down with\nthe ship; he alone had been hurled clear. Learning that, he'd swum\nresolutely in the direction he knew the shore to be, and made it.\n\nExhausted, all right--shocked, naked, half-dead really. But quite ready\nto point out his rank and identity to the first passer-by.\n\nLucky for him, Chet mused, that he'd had no chance to express his callow\narrogance. Shock saved his life--sank him into a stupor, so when the\nAgvars found him, he was helpless. He knew it was only because it had\nseemed perfectly safe that they'd tied him up and brought him to the\nvillage, instead of killing him then and there.\n\nBy the time he'd recovered somewhat from the initial shock and\nexhaustion, they were used to him, convinced he was harmless if well\nchained-up. And they played it safe by giving him nothing but a little\nwater--no clothing, no shelter, no food....\n\nThey let him live, amused by the thirst that drove him to lap up each\nmorning's drenching dew, fascinated by his ravenous appetite for the\ngarbage they flung at him.\n\nThe Agvars--furry, savage half-men, with something of the dog and\nsomething of the ape and little of the man about them--the Agvars let\nhim live, Chet realized, for exactly one reason: he made them feel\nsuperior.\n\nThey'd learn now! Even though the children had stopped shrieking and\ngone away, disgusted at his passivity, no villager's insensitive ears\ncould yet hear the ship.\n\nIn their boastfulness, the Agvars had invited other tribes to come and\nlook at him and poke at him and laugh at him. His presence was known\nover the whole planet. He'd be found, no matter where on Hedlot the\nspaceship landed.\n\nAnd then would come the showdown!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the showdown came earlier than he expected, speeded because the ship\nlanded close by. Chet told himself he should have counted on that kind\nof accuracy, but he'd underestimated his fellow pilots.\n\nHe had himself signalled Earthside, just before the crash, that his ship\nwas about to land. He'd given his position--described sea and shoreline.\nThey'd find him, if he stayed chained to the post.\n\nBut he didn't. Taken unaware by the Agvars who loosed him, Chet was\ndocile, happy even--certain they wouldn't hurt him now, but would try to\nminimize their former cruelty as they turned him over to the spacemen.\n\nWhen they put new chains on him, around neck and waist, he thought it\nwas only to make sure he didn't run away before they could deliver him\nostentatiously to the ship.\n\nA dozen adult males had gathered in the clearing, but that was hardly an\nunusual event. Even when they all started out, on a winding trail that\ndidn't head in the direction of the ship's recent landing-sounds, Chet\nwas convinced they were just circling some geographic obstacle.\n\nHe was interested in the forest of 20-foot mosses and 50-foot evergreen\nhardwoods pressing densely on each side of the trail. Unconscious when\nthey'd carried him from the beach, he'd never been out of the village\nsince, had never inspected these woods. And he thought his mates from\nEarth would want to know about them.\n\nChet could easily have outdistanced the clumsy Agvars if not forced to\nimitate their crouching walk. But he knew from experience that to show\noff his erect stance and 18-inch height advantage would make them find\nsome unpleasant way to put him in his place.\n\nThey'd shown him that quite often. He'd show _them_--but later, not just\nyet. And after showing them, he'd put these Agvars behind him--them,\ntheir filthy planet, and their scorching sun.\n\nIt had often tortured him, that gauzy, amorphous solar blaze, but never\nmore than now. For the sun of Hedlot, when he glanced at it vengefully,\nproved from its position that he was not being taken to the ship, but\naway from it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDisappointment didn't rouse Chet to a fighting pitch--it caused him to\nbecome crafty. Slyness and deceit, the indirect weapons of the\npowerless, were not attributes schooled into a student space-pilot. But\nhe'd learned them tied naked to a sunbaked post. That, too, is an\neffective school.\n\nHe hung back, faking fatigue. Malingering brought him pokes and jerks,\nmade the Agvars choke him and beat him and harangue him in their sullen\nmutter of clicks and growls and glottal catches. But some sense of\nurgency drove them to give up their fruitless sadism after a while, and\ndrag him through the trail's blue mud by brute strength, two on the\nneck-chain, two hauling at his waist.\n\nHe let them. Not that he was inured to pain--he just was stubborn.\n\nHe wondered, once when they all stopped at a spring for a drink and some\nrest, whether their haranguing showed the Agvars were sorry they hadn't\ntaught him their language. Probably not, he decided; probably they\ndidn't want to think he could have learned it.\n\nHe'd tried, in the absence of lessons, by repeating what he heard around\nhim. He'd learned a few words, of course. And for a while, a couple of\nvillagers had seemed to enjoy and encourage his parrot-like attempts to\nrecite whole sentences they voiced for him. But after a few beatings,\nChet gathered that he'd only been mouthing obscenities. And that\nexperience, plus inertia, had made him give up the attempt.\n\nJust as well, he now decided. If they'd known of his technical skills,\nif they'd let him raise their standards, the Agvars might be carrying\nbows and arrows, instead of mere slings and sticks.\n\nTheir hard luck! What they didn't know, they'd never learn from him! The\nmere presence of a spaceship on the same planet gave him a buoyant\nfeeling of contempt.\n\nBut though contempt helped him endure that journey through the tall\nmosses and taller trees, it couldn't ward off exhaustion. When the party\nstopped at the foot of a sheer rock spire that rose four or five hundred\nfeet above the tallest growth, he collapsed and slept.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey woke him in the pre-dawn twilight and another group of Agvars took\nover. These--there were only three--looked older than the familiar\nvillagers. And they'd smeared their faces with bands of red and yellow\nmud. He wondered....\n\nHe stopped wondering when they passed a pile of bones at the base of the\nspire. Among the grisly relics were skulls--brow-ridged, pointed,\nunmistakably Agvar. Sacrifices!\n\nHe was to be killed, then, to propitiate his own rescuers. His three\nguides--or guards--must be witch-doctors! He let them drag him along\nwhile he thought about it.\n\nThey'd give him no breakfast, not even water. If they'd eaten\nthemselves, it was while he still slept. The scraps, if any, hadn't been\nflung in his face, and there'd been no smooth post to lick the dew from.\n\nHunger and thirst were nothing new, but neither was the resulting\nlethargy. Realizing his danger, Chet could only hang back.\n\nToday though that was an old stall; the witch-doctors seemed to expect\nit. They broke branches from the trees and beat him till he bled. And\nwhen the climb up the rocks began, they put one of their number behind\nhim to push, set the other two in front to pull, and tried by main\nstrength to haul him up the five hundred foot rock-face.\n\nHazily, not hastily, Chet tried to think of a way out. His starved brain\ncould come up with nothing. That, he finally decided, was only natural;\nit was not thinking that was needed, but action.\n\nStill, he wasn't precipitate. Caution reinforced his habitual lassitude\nwhile trying to dispell it. Half a dozen times he tensed for combat,\nonly to relax hopelessly. But finally he found a place--and the will--to\nmake a stand.\n\nHe passed up a wide shelf, and let them tug him along a narrow ledge\nwithout much objection. He chose a near-vertical pitch about a hundred\nfeet from the bottom--a mere crack that slanted upward to the right,\noffering the shallowest of hand- and foot-holds.\n\nHe could only hope that he wasn't in sight from the trail--or else that\nthe villagers had left. He couldn't see through the treetops to make\nsure. But he hadn't the strength to worry.\n\nHe froze to the rock, pulling as if in fright. The two witch-doctors in\nsingle file above him jerked on the chains they held. But they needed a\nhand apiece to hold on with, and couldn't lift him.\n\nThe one below, standing on a six-inch ledge, tried to push. When that\ndidn't work, he broke off a chunk of rock and beat Chet's left foot with\nit.\n\nSpurred by the sudden pain, Chet kicked the witch-doctor in the face.\nThe Agvar fell, screaming--until he crashed through the treetops and was\nstill.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo Chet, forgetful of his hearing superiority, it seemed as if that\noutcry would be heard on Earth itself. Certainly he expected it to alarm\nthe countryside. Still, unless the swift foot-thrust had been seen, no\none would be sure the witch-doctor's fall was not an accident....\n\nChet had tasted victory for the first time in three years! He'd had a\nlittle revenge, and he wanted more. He could take the other two\nwitch-doctors with him to death!\n\nHe put all his weight on the chains they held. But they chose not to\ndie--let go, instead, to save themselves. The chain-ends rattled past,\ndislodging a small avalanche of dust and gravel and bruising\nstones--dislodging _him_ when the full weights jerked at neck and waist.\n\nPrepared, he didn't let himself be pulled away from the cliff's face. He\nslid down it to the ledge from which the Agvar below him had fallen.\nThere he teetered a moment, balancing precariously on toes scraped raw\nin his slide. Clawing fingers found a crack to the right, a knob to the\nleft--safety! He clung there breathless.\n\nNo time for resting! Rattling stones warned of pursuit. He looked\nquickly around, found a route, and after a short traverse let himself\nslide to a long talus-slope. Down it he ran barefoot through sharp\ndebris into concealing mosses.\n\nThe silence alarmed him. But it freed him from the need for craft; he\ndidn't know what to avoid nor where it might be lurking, so he set out\nfor the spaceship by what he hoped was the shortest way.\n\nIn the village, he'd located the landing-place by sound, fixed it by\nsun. The sun would guide him now. Not accurately, but well enough.\n\nThe ship would have landed in a clearing. Standing on its tail, it\nshould loom high over the woods. And its men would scatter--he ought to\nrun into one.\n\nRun he did, trotting under thirty pounds of hardwood chain on reserves\nof strength dredged from a deep pit of desperation, through a forest\novergrown with menace, full of life he could always sense but seldom\nsee--of noises whose origin he couldn't guess.\n\nThe Agvars, for all their inferior hearing, could at least interpret\nwhat they heard. Chet couldn't. Every whispered cry, wild grunt and\nmuttered growl was completely unfamiliar. He didn't know which sound\nsignalled danger. He feared them all.\n\nBut more than sounds he feared the silence that chinked the logs of time\nbetween each nerve-wracking noise. Often he had to stop and rest, and\nsilence threatened him then like the ominous quiet of bated breath. When\nhe'd force himself to go on, each tree seemed like a porchful of\nmalicious old women, pretending to disregard him as he passed, certain\nto make trouble when he'd gone. The buzz of small life-forms was a\ndeprecatory murmur, ready at any second to burst into condemnation and\nterror....\n\nWhat was that sound? And that? Noises that seemed out of place in their\nfamiliarity pinned him to the forest floor.\n\nIt was only the village. Satisfied, he worked up courage to skirt the\nplace and walk on toward the ship.\n\nBut he was near collapse. When he heard human voices he could only yell\nincoherently once or twice, sob, and pass out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDimly through succeeding days Chet was aware of the ship's sickbay, of\nthe enlisted attendants, the hovering doctor, the silent commander.\nLater he realized he'd been kept under opiates so his body could recover\nwhile his mind rested. At the time, he felt only the dimness.\n\nIt wore off abruptly. He was in a civilized cot, stretching luxuriously,\naware of warmth and comfort and a cheerful voice that seemed familiar.\n\nHe opened his eyes. A fat young corpsman had been watching.\n\n\"How do you feel, sir?\" the boy said. \"Ready for coffee?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Chet answered. And grinned lazily as he sat up to sip the\nproffered cup. \"You've taken good care of me.\"\n\n\"Used to be a barber in civilian life,\" the boy said smugly. And Chet\nfound with an exploratory hand that he'd been shaven and shorn, bathed,\nbandaged where necessary--even, he saw, clad in a pair of fancy red\nbroadcloth pajamas.\n\n\"You've got me cleaned up, all right,\" he said. \"Whose p.j.'s have I got\non?\"\n\n\"Dr. Pine's, sir. You'll see him in a couple of minutes--he and the Old\nMan been waiting to question you. There's a robe and slippers, if you\nwant me to help you get up....\"\n\n\"I'm not helpless,\" Chet said, boasting in his turn. He proved it by\nclimbing--gingerly--out of the cot. The boy helped him into the robe,\nfound the slippers, pushed the small room's one chair an inch closer to\nthe open porthole, and left, closing the door behind him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVaguely Chet found he knew the two men who soon entered the room--they'd\nbeen there before. But this was his first fully conscious look at them.\nCommander Seymour, the C.O., looked surprisingly young for his job. He\n_was_ young, Chet decided--not over thirty-five--and his short slight\nfigure made him seem younger still.\n\nHe had few words. \"You're looking fine, Barfield,\" he said, and sat on\nthe edge of the cot, thin face impassive, gray eyes alert.\n\nDr. Pine--tall, balding, affable--was associated in Chet's mind with\nhypodermic needles, bitter medicines, restrictions. Today, the doctor\ngave him a firm and friendly handshake, but yesterday, Chet felt, that\nsame hand had inflicted pain.\n\n\"Glad to see you looking so well,\" the doctor said, taking a stance\nagainst the wall by the porthole. He sounded sincere enough, but Chet,\nresuming his chair, wondered how much of the gladness was based on the\ndoctor's pride in professional handiwork.\n\nThere was an awkward pause. Chet remembered to murmur polite replies to\nthe men who were so obviously sizing him up. Then he asked, \"When do you\nthink I'll be ready for duty?\"\n\nHis visitors exchanged a glance. \"Later,\" Commander Seymour said. \"Take\nit easy while you can, Barfield.\" He smiled unconvincingly at what must\nhave been meant as a joke.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTalk again lapsed, and Chet became uncomfortable. \"The corpsman said you\nwanted to ask me some things,\" he said. And added, \"You've already\nquestioned me, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Only a little,\" Dr. Pine said, flexing his long fingers and looking\ndown at them. \"We--ah--we had to find out about your shipmates.\nCommander Seymour wanted to look for them, naturally....\"\n\nNaturally.... \"Are we going to leave here now, sir?\" Chet asked the\ncommander.\n\n\"Not yet,\" he said. \"Dr. Pine has a job to do.\"\n\n\"What's that, Doctor?\"\n\n\"I'm going to study your Agvar friends, Mr. Barfield. Want to help?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Chet said. \"There's nothing I'd rather do than bring you a few\ncorpses to dissect.\"\n\n\"That--ah--that isn't the idea,\" Dr. Pine said, bending his fingers and\nrocking from toes to heels. \"I--ah--I want to do a little\nanthropology--study them in the life....\"\n\n\"Why?\" Chet demanded. \"I can tell you all about them. I can tell you\nwhat they did to me, too! They don't deserve to live! And this planet\nwon't be safe for spacemen till they're dead. Why waste time studying\nthem? It isn't as if you were a professional anthropologist, sir--didn't\nyou give me medical care?\"\n\n\"Yes.... But I do anthropology, too. Medical help--ah--gains the\nconfidence of the people....\"\n\n\"You mean--?\" Chet was at first incredulous, then outraged. \"You mean\nyou're not going to punish them?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Dr. Pine said, smiling.\n\n\"That's wrong!\" Chet contradicted.\n\nCheeks burning, he turned to Commander Seymour. \"How about you, sir? Do\nyou want your men chained to a post if they get captured? Do you want me\nto dismiss three years of torture as a mistake, or something? Do you\nwant--\"\n\n\"Here, here!\" Commander Seymour said. He didn't raise his voice. But as\nhe rose from the cot, Chet rose with him, and found himself at\nattention. They eyed each other.\n\n\"Relax,\" Dr. Pine suggested. \"Please sit down--both of you.\"\n\nCommander Seymour obeyed his subordinate. But Chet, still standing,\nstill angry, turned hotly on the doctor.\n\n\"I can't just sit and let you talk about rewarding the Agvars for\ntorturing me!\" he cried. \"We don't have to appease them--they can't\nfight. You don't have to be afraid--\"\n\n\"That'll do, Barfield!\" Commander Seymour was on his feet again, and his\ntone was sharp. It quieted Chet instantly.\n\nIn silence he watched Commander Seymour motion Dr. Pine to follow him\nout the door. Someone locked it after them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlternately tossing on the cot and pacing the floor, Chet seethed for\nhours. His first interview with the new C.O., and two bawlings-out in\nfive minutes! Because of Pine--Pine, who kept him confined in this room,\nseeing no one but the attendants, having his meals alone....\n\nWhen a day passed, and then two, and he felt his strength returning,\nChet was sure that Dr. Pine kept him out of the wardroom and away from\nthe other officers only as punishment. Three years a prisoner--and a\nprisoner still! By the time Commander Seymour came to see him again,\nChet had spent hours plotting revenge.\n\n\"Barfield,\" the commander said, \"Dr. Pine is going--alone--to the\nvillage you escaped from. He'll pretend he's you, or someone like\nyou--whichever he can get away with. So here's your chance for a little\nfresh air--you can guide us to the village.\"\n\n\"Does that mean I go on active duty, sir?\"\n\n\"Not quite. Dr. Pine hasn't released you from sickbay.\"\n\nPine again! Pine found him good enough to imitate, it seemed, but not\ngood enough to put on duty.\n\nSuddenly Chet saw the possibilities. So Pine was going to impersonate\nhim? Then Pine would be taken for an escaped sacrifice, a prisoner who'd\nkilled a witch-doctor!\n\nTell him? Huh. Let him find out the hard way! Then even he, yellow as he\nwas, would want revenge on the Agvars. If he survived their welcome....\n\n\"I'll be _glad_ to go, sir,\" Chet said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey brought him fatigues, not a dress uniform. But fatigues and\nshoes--even tight ones--were clothing, at least. And clothing would\nchange his appearance. The Agvars had never seen him dressed, nor, since\nhis first days, with a haircut and shave. Whether Pine's impersonation\nworked or not, Chet saw no danger for himself in approaching the\nvillage. But he wondered how it was to be managed.\n\nHe was told the plan when Commander Seymour and Dr. Pine met him outside\nby the ship's tail. The commander, who was armed, and the doctor,\nalready naked except for a pair of slippers and a sunlamp tan, would go\nwith him by the shortest route direct to the village. But only Dr. Pine\nwould enter it.\n\nCommander Seymour explained Chet's part--and his own. \"Barfield,\" he\nsaid, \"I want you to find and point out some kind of game animal they\nuse for food. I count on killing something after we come under the\nAgvars' observation. That should show off our weapon-superiority--and\npave the way for a feast.\"\n\n\"No medical stuff?\" Chet asked sarcastically. \"I thought Dr. Pine was\nsupposed to cure all their ills, not give them indigestion.\"\n\n\"He has to get their confidence before he can treat them,\" Commander\nSeymour explained seriously. \"And on a strange planet like this, he's\ntaking quite a chance to try treatment at any time: if it fails, they're\napt to accuse him of murder!\"\n\nChet said nothing. But he felt as if he'd drawn a wild card in a poker\ngame.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey'd entered the woods. Even before that, Dr. Pine had lagged because\nhis slippers kept falling off, and now he brought up the rear. Chet, in\nthe lead, took a last long look at the ship before the trees and mosses\ncut off his view.\n\nHe went on slowed by vague reluctance. He didn't like this forest. The\ntrees dwarfed and oppressed him. Old fears began to stir and gnaw, but\nat new places.\n\nPerhaps the two men he guided would stand together against him. If so,\nrevenge on one would cut him off from both as sharply as the forest cut\nhim off from the ship....\n\nWell, it was worth it! They hadn't put him on duty, hadn't accepted him\nas one of themselves.... He couldn't be cut off much more than he was\nalready!\n\nAnd Seymour might listen to reason. After all, he was a practical man, a\nleader. And Pine was yellow!\n\n\"What's Pine after, sir?\" Chet asked over his shoulder. \"Why take these\nrisks you've mentioned?\"\n\n\"Well, partly for safety: if we kill any Agvars, we're likely to have to\nkill them all, or have the survivors to contend with indefinitely. That\nmight cost us some casualties.... And of course there's the research\nangle, but that's out of my line.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with punishment, sir--discipline? You use discipline\non your crew--why not on their enemies?\"\n\n\"Because the men understand the rules and the penalties. The Agvars\ndon't.\"\n\n\"Kill them, sir! That they'll understand!\"\n\n\"No!\" Commander Seymour spoke sharply. \"If they don't fight back, that's\ncold-blooded slaughter. If they do, it's war. I don't hold with\nbutchery, Barfield, and I certainly won't risk casualties just to give\nyou a cheap feeling of satisfaction!\"\n\nHe couldn't escape. Commander Seymour, looking from over Chet's shoulder\nlike a walking sneer, stuck close. But he gave the impression of\nfollowing a man who smelled bad.\n\n_Was he?_ Chet wondered.\n\nWondering, he unconsciously hung his head, slowed--stopped. Dr. Pine\ncaught up. He and Commander Seymour, faintly breathless from the trying\nneed to regulate their respiration consciously, looked at Chet\nquestioningly.\n\nAgain they were sizing him up. Suddenly Chet wished he could go back to\nthat first interview in the sickbay, and change all the things he'd\nsaid.\n\n\"We can't go on!\" he blurted. \"You don't know what you're getting into,\nDoctor!\"\n\n\"Oh?\" said Dr. Pine agreeably. \"I know more than you think, young\nfeller.\" He smiled encouragingly.\n\n\"That--that I've killed a witch-doctor? That you may be taken for a\nmurderer?\"\n\n\"Sure! You--ah--you talked about it under drugs. We ... weren't spying,\nChet. We just wanted you to tell your story without reliving all the\nagony. It wasn't intended as--ah--a trap....\" He massaged his fingers\napologetically.\n\n\"No....\" Chet agreed. \"But-I-was-trying-to-lead-_you_-into-one!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHad he said that aloud? Chet couldn't be sure.\n\nHe listened for his own voice. The woods were quiet. His breathing\nseemed strangely loud. He held it--and heard the Agvars moving in the\nwoods. Rustling, scraping, crackling--grunting their guttural dialog.\nCrashing! Threatening them!\n\n\"Let's go back!\" he urged, trying to sound casual. But his trail was\nblocked.\n\n\"Stick around,\" Dr. Pine suggested easily. \"You--ah--you haven't said\nanything we didn't know. We're going right ahead.\"\n\n\"But why?\" Once more Chet was hotly incredulous. \"To risk your life for a\nfew stray facts? Become a casualty while trying to _avoid_ casualties?\nIt doesn't make sense!\"\n\nDr. Pine stared at his own hands as if to hide his shyness in them. \"As\nto the fact-seeking,\" he said slowly, \"well ... it's a matter of\nopinion. I've lost a few classmates.... Risks in research are\ncommonplace--and accepted as worthwhile by most people....\n\n\"And--ah--peace.... You once called it appeasement, but it isn't,\nalways. Well, look. If we fought those Agvars, somebody'd have to take a\npatrol into their village and capture prisoners for our Intelligence,\nright?\"\n\nChet nodded dumbly.\n\n\"Well, in a way, I--ah--am the peaceful equivalent of that patrol.\nThe--ah--risk I run is less than if we had a war and a patrol skirmish\nas part of it, though. And why in the world not take for peace a risk\nwe'd routinely accept in war?\"\n\nWhy not? But why not minimize it, just the same. The Agvars, invisible\nbut noisy, were all around them, now. At any moment the woods might rain\nspears.\n\n\"It would be safer with two of us,\" Chet said musingly. \"Your knowledge\nof anthropology and medicine--mine of the people--\"\n\n\"Barfield, you're still on the sicklist,\" Commander Seymour pointed out.\nHe watched Chet's face for a long moment before adding, \"Still--if\nyou're over your sick-minded need for revenge--it's possible Dr. Pine\nmay find you fit. It's up to him.\"\n\nChet was afraid to ask directly. He pleaded with his eyes.\n\nDr. Pine grinned broadly at the both. \"He's ready for duty, sir,\" he\nsaid.\n\nCommander Seymour stepped back and scowled. \"All right, Mr. Barfield,\"\nhe barked, \"I'll give you just three minutes to change to the uniform of\nthe day!\"\n\nChet's jaw dropped. His vision, also downcast, noted the fatigues he\nwore, the muddy shoes. Then he looked up, saw the twinkle in his C.O.'s\neyes, and understood.\n\nIn exactly three minutes he made the required change. He would enter the\nvillage as he'd left it--in the undress uniform of a Man....\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Uniform of a Man, by Dave Dryfoos\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK UNIFORM OF A MAN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32737.txt or 32737.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/7/3/32737/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
