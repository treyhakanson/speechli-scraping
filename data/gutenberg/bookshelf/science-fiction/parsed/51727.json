All you need is\n              brains, energy--and a steno with nice legs!\n\n\nAndrew Stephens was trying to think of two things at once, and it\nwasn't working out. An inspirational message (delivered by Crumbly,\npresident of Planetary Promotions, Inc.) was mixing itself up in his\nmind with the probable difficulties of his first company assignment.\n\nHe hoped he was thinking, and not worrying. Crumbly said worry was\nfatal in the promotion business. It was fervor, not fret, Crumbly said,\nthat had made Planetary Promotions, Inc., what it was today. And it\nwas work, not worry, that would make it what it was destined to be\ntomorrow.\n\nAndy Stephens stared at the farthest corner of his office (about four\nfeet from his nose) and sighed. He didn't have a slogan in his body,\nlet alone on (or off) the top of his head.\n\nHis assignment was an easy one, Crumbly had assured him. Planetary\nPromotions always started new men off with easy ones. Only fair.\n\nAndy squared his narrowish shoulders in as close an imitation of\nCrumbly's desk-side manner as he could, and picked up the dope sheet.\n\nIt seemed there was a planet, Felix II, somewhere near the edge of\nnowhere. It wanted to join the Galactic Federation.\n\nA laudable desire, Andy thought, but strictly a political matter,\nhaving nothing to do with Planetary Promotions, or Andrew Stephens.\n\nHowever, it also seemed that a planet had to demonstrate that it would\nbe contributing something to the Federation before it was allowed to\njoin. In other words, Andy thought, you have to have something they\nwant, or they won't let you in.\n\nA buzzer squawked out of the dun-colored box on his desk. Andy jumped,\nand flipped the lever.\n\n\"The bus to the port will be at the door in seven minutes,\" the grim\nvoice of the Lower Office Co-ordinator told him. \"A stenographer will\nmeet you on the ship.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Ellis,\" Andy said meekly. He stuffed the dope sheet\ninto his jacket and left the Main Office for Felix II.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said a feminine voice. \"Are you with Planetary Promotions?\"\n\nAndy looked up. A sandy-haired girl with a passable figure and nice\nlegs was looking down at him. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I'm Andy Stephens.\"\n\nThe girl looked relieved. \"I'm Edith Featherpenny from the steno pool,\"\nshe said. \"I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find you.\"\n\n\"Sit down,\" Andy invited.\n\nHe moved, and Miss Featherpenny moved. Between them, they unsettled a\nlarge woman eating an orange. When the juice had been mopped up and the\nwoman apologized to, Miss Featherpenny squeezed in beside Andy.\n\n\"Is that the information on the case?\" She indicated the dope sheet\ncrumpled under Andy's arm.\n\n\"Yes.\" Andy tried to pull it out. \"Were you issued one?\" He moved his\nelbow and tried again.\n\nThe orange woman glared at him.\n\nMiss Featherpenny shook her head. \"Miss Ellis told me you'd tell me\neverything I needed to know.\"\n\nAndy felt obscurely flattered. \"It doesn't look too promising,\" he\nadmitted.\n\nMiss Featherpenny glanced at the dope sheet and found a ray of hope.\n\"The Federation only requires that the Felician exports are nearly as\nvaluable as their imports,\" she pointed out. \"'Nearly' is a nice vague,\nmaneuverable word.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Andy, \"if the Felicians can't think of anything to sell,\nhow do they expect me to?\"\n\n\"Maybe they're too isolated to know what's in demand,\" Miss\nFeatherpenny comforted him. \"It says they won't authorize ships to\nland on the planet except by invitation.\"\n\n\"It might be isolation, I suppose,\" Andy doubted. He felt an urge to\nconfide in Miss Featherpenny. She did, after all, look as if there\nmight be something besides fluff in her head.\n\n\"Look,\" he said. \"This is my first assignment, on my fourth job, on my\nsecond career. I've got to make good. My father is beginning to get\nimpatient.\"\n\nMiss Featherpenny's eyes grew softer. \"Fathers are usually more patient\nthan their children think,\" she encouraged.\n\n\"But,\" Andy added morosely, \"I have a brother, a salesman with\nUniversal Products. He keeps getting promoted, and I keep getting\nfired. Dad must be conscious of the contrast.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Miss Featherpenny suggested, \"your brother's been lucky. You\nknow, being assigned jobs that were easier than they sound.\"\n\nAndy glanced at her to see if he was being humored. He decided he\nwas not, or not much. \"I've tried to believe that,\" he admitted.\n\"Unfortunately, Lloyd keeps proving me wrong. He got his last promotion\nfor selling fancy food products to the Mahridgians.\"\n\nMiss Featherpenny had obviously never even heard of Mahridge.\n\n\"They have a strong taboo against eating,\" Andy explained. \"They\nswallow concentrates to keep alive, but it's still not quite decent. On\nMahridge, it's the dining room, not the bathroom, that has a door with\na lock on it for privacy.\n\n\"Is he married?\" asked Miss Featherpenny, who didn't intend to be a\nsteno all her life. \"I mean,\" she added quickly, \"his wife would get\nanxious about his selling something like that, that could get him put\nin prison, or killed. How did he do it?\"\n\nThere was a certain coolness in Andy's voice. \"He took a lead from the\ndope peddlers. He converted the adolescent Mahridgians first. It's all\nright to eat on Mahridge now.\"\n\nMiss Featherpenny diplomatized. \"I don't think that's ethical.\nConvincing people to do what they think is wrong.\"\n\nAndy was still suspicious. He said, \"Ethical or not, he got the\npromotion.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey stood at the edge of the only launching pad on Felix II, and\nsurveyed the landscape. Thirty feet away, there was a barnsized stone\nbuilding with a weedy roof. Aside from some rounded blue hills in the\ndistance, and a Felician leaning against the building, there was not\nmuch to detain the eye.\n\nMiss Featherpenny giggled softly in surprise. \"He looks like a\nleprechaun,\" she said. \"The sheet didn't say that.\"\n\n\"Tourist trade,\" Andy breathed, his eyes gleaming with the solution of\nhis problem.\n\nSince the two-foot-tall welcoming committee showed no signs of moving,\nthey started toward him.\n\n\"My name,\" Andy said in Galactic, \"is Andrew Stephens. I'm here from\nPlanetary Promotions.\"\n\n\"I know,\" the Felician muttered ungraciously. \"I came out from town to\nmeet you. My name is Blahrog. Who's this?\"\n\n\"My steno, Miss Featherpenny.\"\n\n\"Urk.\" Obviously Blahrog had never heard the term \"steno\" and\nwas interpreting it freely. \"I'm in charge of our admission to\nthe Federation. That means I'm in charge of you.\" He eyed Andy\nunenthusiastically. \"You haven't had much experience with this kind of\nthing, have you?\"\n\nAndy had a wild rush of hope. If the Felician government rejected him\nas a representative, he could go home without a failure on his record,\nand pray for a simpler assignment. Even P. P. didn't consider an agent\nresponsible for the unpredictable whims of aliens.\n\n\"No, I haven't,\" he replied cheerfully. \"I was hoping maybe you had.\"\n\nMiss Featherpenny, who hadn't read the contract, gasped.\n\nBlahrog, who had read the contract, replied, \"I haven't. Let's get on\ninto town where we can discuss the possibilities in comfort.\"\n\nThey set out, walking unequally through the thick white dust that\npassed for paving on Felix II.\n\n\"Don't you use ground cars?\" Miss Featherpenny choked at the end of the\nfirst half-mile.\n\n\"Don't have technology,\" Blahrog growled, stumping grimly along. \"The\nEverking has a car, but he doesn't use it much. No fuel.\"\n\nAs he walked, Andy composed a speech on the merits of the tourist\nbusiness, to be delivered to the Everking.\n\nMiss Featherpenny grew visibly more depressed with each mile. She\nuttered an involuntary cry when the guard of the city gate appeared\nwith a slender mug in each hand.\n\n\"Felician ladies don't drink,\" Blahrog said gruffly.\n\n\"I can fetch you a glass of water,\" the guard offered, without\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Miss Featherpenny, with an attempt at sincerity.\n\nThe contents of his mug made Andy choke. \"Tastes something like\ncider,\" he gasped.\n\nBlahrog downed his without a wink. \"It's customary to give a guest a\nmug of Throatduster as a sign of gratitude because he walked so far in\nthe dust.\"\n\n\"In this dust,\" Miss Featherpenny murmured to her second glass of\nwater, \"any distance is far.\"\n\n\"Thoughtful custom,\" Andy said quickly. \"Could you export the beverage?\"\n\n\"Sell Throatduster?\" Blahrog was indignant. \"It would be a breach of\nhospitality. Besides, Felix II can't produce enough second-rate stuff,\nlet alone first-rate. Sometimes, in a bad year, we have to greet guests\nwith water.\"\n\n\"What a pity,\" said Miss Featherpenny.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe became increasingly unsympathetic as Andy swallowed another\nThroatduster at the door of the Palace (a one-story building similar\nto a small barn), and yet another in the presence of the Everking (an\neighteen-inch Felician with a beard-warmed paunch).\n\nAndy watched the Everking dim and blur on his wooden throne. Swaying\nslightly, he muttered, \"I wonder what proof this stuff is?\"\n\n\"In short, Mr. Stephens,\" Blahrog was translating, \"we cannot think\nof a single product which we could sell. Have you any immediate\nsuggestions?\"\n\nBlahrog's expression indicated that he ought to say something, but\nAndy couldn't think of a thing, except that he didn't need any more\nThroatduster. \"No,\" he said firmly, if faintly. \"Thank you very much,\nbut no.\" He passed out cold.\n\n\"I'm afraid the journey was too much for him,\" Miss Featherpenny put in.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" Blahrog translated for the Everking. \"Throatduster has that\neffect on some life forms. Perhaps he had better retire, and discuss\nthe situation more fully tomorrow.\"\n\nThe Everking motioned to a pair of stout-looking guards (thirty inches\ntall, at least). They towed Miss Featherpenny's immediate superior out\nof the royal presence.\n\n\"They will show him to his room,\" Blahrog explained.\n\nThe Everking let loose a quick stream of Felician.\n\n\"Would you,\" Blahrog addressed Miss Featherpenny, \"enjoy meeting my\ndaughter? The Everking suggests it, since our affairs could hardly be\nof interest to you.\"\n\n\"I'd be very pleased.\" The words were not empty ones. Edith\nFeatherpenny's education in coping with men had not extended to\nFelician males. Blahrog frightened her with a feeling of superior and\nincomprehensible intelligence.\n\nHrom, although seventeen inches tall and weighing perhaps eleven\npounds, was definitely feminine and comprehensible.\n\n\"Why don't women drink Throatduster?\" Miss Featherpenny asked, on the\nstrength of a two-hour acquaintance.\n\n\"The men grow the grain here,\" Hrom explained, \"and it's theirs as long\nas it's in the fields. However, we consider harvesting women's work. We\nalso make the Throatduster. Then we sell it to the men. We don't drink\nbecause it is uneconomical.\"\n\n\"Does everyone grow his own grain?\"\n\n\"Not any more. Town women have other sources of dress money. The custom\nstarted that way, that's all.\"\n\n\"If you'll forgive my saying so,\" Miss Featherpenny remarked, \"that\ndress you are wearing must have taken a big chunk out of your pocket.\"\n\nHrom sighed. \"In my mother's time, I would have thought nothing of it.\nNow, one such gown is all I can afford.\"\n\n\"I would have thought your father was one of the wealthier men on Felix\nII,\" Miss Featherpenny remarked.\n\n\"He is _the_ wealthiest,\" Hrom said. \"The richest man is always\nMinister of Finance. It's only reasonable.\" Her tone changed. \"We're\nall poor now, since the tourist industry failed. It took every dnot we\nhad to pay for the contract.\"\n\nInvisible antennae shot from Miss Featherpenny's forehead. \"You must\nbe quite sure that Planetary Promotions won't fail you.\" She tried her\nbest to sound casual.\n\nHrom smiled faintly. \"Have another of these seed cakes,\" she said.\n\n\"Thank you. They are delicious.\" Miss Featherpenny took one, regardless\nof calories. \"Of course, there is the guarantee clause: 'Double your\nmoney back.'\"\n\nHrom busily fluffed a cushion. \"One must have some insurance,\" she\nsaid, having her turn at sounding casual. \"Tell me, are they wearing\nlarge or small hats on Earth this season?\"\n\nMiss Featherpenny conceded defeat. \"It's all bonnets for summer,\" she\nsaid.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer first impulse was to tell Andy that she thought the Felicians\nhad bought the guarantee clause, not the contract. It died at her\nfirst sight of the morning-after Andy. The situation must be pretty\ndesperate, she rationalized, when the wealthiest girl on the planet\nhas only one dress. This is probably their last chance.\n\nAndy tried to conceal his headache by being brisk and efficient. \"Have\nyou considered your natural resources?\"\n\nBlahrog, slow and shrewdly inefficient, said, \"We mine soft coal.\nEnough for our own fires and to spare.\"\n\n\"No one within a hundred light-years of Felix II uses coal for fuel\nanymore,\" Andy said gently. \"Do you have enough for the plastic\nindustries?\"\n\n\"We have four freighters surplus every season.\" Blahrog was evidently\nbanking heavily on the coal.\n\nAndy wondered if coal were the only surplus on Felix II. \"What are you\ndoing with your surplus at present?\" he inquired tactfully, hoping\nthat Blahrog would realize, without being told, the impossibility of\nsupporting the population of Felix II on four freighters of soft coal.\n\n\"We store it up,\" was the crafty answer, \"and sell it to the synthetics\nplants on Darius IV when the Ionian miners go on strike.\"\n\n\"How long since the Ionians struck?\" If this economic event occurred\nregularly, the coal surplus could assist in meeting the Federation's\nrequirements.\n\n\"Twenty seasons or so.\" Blahrog's tone was off-handed, but his eyes\nslid guiltily toward Andy and away again.\n\nAndy sighed. \"Any other resources?\"\n\nThey went quickly through minerals, agricultural products and animal\nskins; established that Felicians could not teleport, levitate or read\nminds. They were technologically uneducated, and had no industry on the\nfactory-system level.\n\n\"It is coal or nothing, Mr. Stephens,\" Blahrog said with finality.\n\"Isn't there some way to make the Federation believe that our coal is\nsuperior to other coal, and worth more?\"\n\n\"Do you, perchance, own a sizable proportion of Felician coal reserves?\"\n\nBlahrog nodded, guilty looking again.\n\n\"Well, forget it. There isn't enough.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Everking, who had been holding Andy's translator to his ear in\nsilence, burst into speech.\n\n\"His Foreverness says,\" Blahrog remarked cannily, \"that it appears\nimpossible for Felix II to join the Federation.\"\n\n\"We aren't through yet,\" Andy said quickly. \"What about the tourist\nindustry? If you'd allow visitors and advertise a little....\"\n\n\"No,\" the Everking shouted, in Galactic.\n\n\"We tried that during the last reign,\" Blahrog said. \"It didn't work.\"\n\n\"You're pretty far off the shipping lanes, I'll admit,\" Andy said,\n\"but surely you could attract enough tourists from somewhere to show a\nprofit.\"\n\n\"We showed a profit,\" Blahrog said morosely.\n\nHe translated a remark of the Everking's. \"We made money hand over\nfist.\"\n\n\"Then why did you quit?\" Andy was baffled. \"Why did you restrict the\nplanet?\"\n\n\"Because of the way we happen to look.\"\n\n\"Like leprechauns,\" Miss Featherpenny explained. \"And Hrom looks\nexactly like a little Christmas fairy.\"\n\nBlahrog winced. \"The tourists found us amusing. We weren't real to\nthem. It became difficult for us to seem real to ourselves. Most of\nmy generation couldn't grow up. The birth rate dropped. We closed the\nplanet to keep the race alive. That's all there is to it.\"\n\n\"Surely,\" Andy protested, \"if you handled it differently....\"\n\n\"Tourists,\" Blahrog translated for the Everking, \"are out of the\nquestion.\"\n\n\"I remember hearing about an intelligent life form that resembled\nteddy bears,\" Miss Featherpenny said thoughtfully. \"Everybody loved\nthem on sight.\"\n\n\"What happened to them?\" Blahrog asked with interest.\n\n\"They became extinct.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAndy glared at her. How could he accomplish anything with a stupid\nsteno butting in? She looked away, guilty.\n\n\"It's such a simple solution,\" he said. \"It fits your situation\nperfectly.\"\n\n\"That's what we thought, until we tried it,\" Blahrog said, grinning\nsidelong at Miss Featherpenny.\n\n\"If you won't try tourists,\" Andy snapped at both of them, \"I don't see\nexactly what you can do.\"\n\n\"Maybe you didn't cover everything in the special abilities list,\" Miss\nFeatherpenny suggested softly.\n\nAndy glared at her again. \"All right, Blahrog. Can you think of\nanything you can do that most other species can't?\"\n\nBlahrog looked at the floor and considered. \"We can walk a long way\nwithout getting tired,\" he offered.\n\nAndy sighed, and wrote \"Endurance?\" on his scratch pad. It was scarcely\nsaleable. \"Is there anything else? Anything you know how to make?\nBesides Throatduster.\"\n\n\"We make good shoes,\" Blahrog said hopefully. \"The tourists used to buy\nlots of them.\"\n\n\"Hum,\" Andy cogitated. \"Here we have something for which a market\nalready exists. If we can expand the market and the production\nfacilities....\" He nailed Blahrog with a finger, in conscious imitation\nof Crumbly. \"How many pairs of shoes can Felix II produce in a single\nseason?\"\n\n\"If the reserves were called in to the Cobbler's Guild, it would be\nalmost half the manpower of the planet....\" Blahrog paused, doing\nmental arithmetic. \"Four and a half million pairs, more or less.\" He\nsounded as though he were surprised.\n\n\"That ought to do it,\" Andy said gleefully.\n\n\"But where will we find that many pairs of feet?\" Blahrog asked.\n\n\"There are eight million times that many pairs of feet in the\nFederation,\" Andy said. \"Leave the advertising to Planetary Promotions.\"\n\n\"It seems sort of poetic,\" Miss Featherpenny romanced. \"Leprechauns are\nsupposed to be cobblers.\"\n\nBlahrog snorted.\n\nAndy turned and addressed her from the full distance between a promoter\nthird class and a girl from the steno pool. \"Miss Featherpenny, I will\nask for your opinion when I want it.\"\n\nMiss Featherpenny answered from her side of the gulf. \"Yes, sir.\"\n\nAndy had always despised rank-pullers. He turned to Blahrog \"I'll have\nto send the dope back to the Home Office so they can put it through the\ncomputer and send me the ad-intensity index.\"\n\nBlahrog looked a polite enquiry.\n\n\"That will tell us how effective the ad campaign will have to be to\nmake a go of this. What's the fastest way to send a message to Earth?\"\n\n\"Radiogram the satellite station,\" Blahrog answered. \"They'll relay it\nto the next ship within range, and the ship will relay it to the next\nplanet it nears with the radiogram facilities to send it to Earth.\"\n\n\"How long will it take to get an answer?\" Andy asked.\n\n\"About twelve days.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey didn't stare at the sky while they waited for the answer.\n\nBlahrog called the members of the Cobbler's Guild together, and\ndelivered a series of lectures on their importance to the future of\nFelix II.\n\nForeseeing a return to political and economic power, the reserve\nmembers dusted off their lasts and aprons and got back into practice.\nFor the first time in nearly thirty seasons, the applications for\napprenticeship were too numerous to handle. New life showed on their\nfaces.\n\nThe Master Cobblers (including the Everking and Blahrog) worked around\nthe clock, fabricating plastic lasts. Miss Featherpenny and Hrom dug\npictures and descriptions of the various types of Galactic feet that\nhabitually or occasionally wore shoes out of old periodicals, located\nby members of the newly-organized ladies' auxiliary.\n\nFelix II was humming, if not absolutely singing, with industry and\ngood humor. Some of it rubbed off on Andy. He relented toward Miss\nFeatherpenny to the extent of presenting her with a pair of Felician\nshoes, fabricated by the Everking. They were of the sensible walking\nvariety, and not Miss Featherpenny's style. Nevertheless, she was\nextremely pleased with the gift. Like all Felician shoes, they fit her\nperfectly.\n\nThe Everking, backed by his Debators and ministers, issued public\nthanks to one Andrew Stephens, restorer of hope, and propagator\nof economic equality. The ladies' auxiliary gave a tea in Miss\nFeatherpenny's honor. They were both showered with gifts from a\ngrateful and admiring populace.\n\nThe reply to the message was signed by Crumbly himself. \"Forlorn hope,\"\nit said unsympathetically. \"Try something else. Computer indicates ad\nintensity of 0.94.\"\n\nAn ad intensity of 0.0001 means you sell someone something he wants\nanyway. An intensity of 1.0 means you have to make the consumer love\nsomething he thinks he hates.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAndy sent a young Felician on the run for Blahrog, and retired to the\nstoreroom of Blahrog's dwelling, which housed two fair-sized plastic\nbarrels of Throatduster.\n\n\"But you have to try,\" Blahrog insisted, finishing his second mug of\nhospitality.\n\n\"Snow good,\" Andy said, deep into his fifth. \"Even Gray Flannel, ad man\nin legend, only got to 0.87. Simpossible.\"\n\nBlahrog, who knew little about advertising or computers, repeated,\n\"You must try. No member of the Cobbler's Guild has ever quit without\ntrying.\"\n\nAndy had been accepted as an apprentice of the Guild the night before.\n\n\"Dunno,\" he said. \"Tell you simpossible.\"\n\nBlahrog climbed off the barrel of Throatduster. \"I'll go get Miss\nFeatherpenny,\" he said. \"Perhaps she can help you.\"\n\n\"Miss Featherpenny. Bah,\" Andy snorted. \"What good would she be? Dumb\nsteno.\" He tried to be fair. \"Nice legs, I admit. But no brains.\"\n\n\"I'll go get Miss Featherpenny,\" Blahrog repeated firmly, closing the\ndoor behind him....\n\n\"What frame of mind is he in?\" Miss Featherpenny looked uncertainly at\nthe heavy door to Andy's store room.\n\n\"Drunk,\" Blahrog informed her coldly.\n\nIt takes an enormous quantity of Throatduster to intoxicate a Felician.\nIntoxication is therefore considered bad form.\n\n\"And belligerent,\" the Minister of Finance added.\n\n\"Oh, dear.\" Miss Featherpenny looked at the door again. \"But what can I\ndo?\" she asked in a helpless voice. \"I'm not a promoter.\"\n\n\"He said,\" Blahrog indicated the door, \"that you were a dumb steno.\"\n\n\"Well!\" Hrom exclaimed.\n\nMiss Featherpenny's hackles invisibly rose. Her mouth visibly\ntightened. She turned away from the door.\n\nHrom said, \"You ought to try to show him.\"\n\nMiss Featherpenny looked at them, and at the surrounding examples of\nFelician landscape and architecture.\n\n\"Mr. Blahrog,\" she said suddenly, \"you don't mind looking like a\nleprechaun, do you? As long as you don't have to meet people?\"\n\nBlahrog's silence was more than dignified.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Hrom asked.\n\n\"You wouldn't mind if we used a picture of a Master Cobbler in the ad,\nwould you?\"\n\nBlahrog thawed abruptly. \"You have an idea?\"\n\n\"If you don't mind the picture.\"\n\n\"He doesn't mind,\" Hrom said, adding in Felician, \"After all, Papa, we\ndon't have to let any ships but the freighters land.\"\n\n\"Go ahead, then,\" Blahrog consented.\n\n\"Good luck,\" Hrom added.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You,\" Andy welcomed her. \"Bah.\" He shut his eyes. Most of him was\nsprawled out on the floor.\n\n\"Yes, me,\" Miss Featherpenny agreed, repressing an inclination to kick\nhim. She sat down on one of the kegs, and opened her stenographer's\nbook. \"I came to take down the ad for the shoes,\" she announced.\n\n\"What ad?\" Andy moaned. \"The newest, biggest, brightest ads can't get\nover an 0.62. How can I manage an 0.94? You're crazy.\" He opened his\neyes. \"But you do have nice legs.\"\n\n\"Felix II is sort of quaint,\" Miss Featherpenny suggested. \"Why not use\nan old ad?\"\n\n\"An idea,\" Andy enunciated, without hope.\n\n\"It's sort of pretty too,\" Miss Featherpenny nudged.\n\n\"We could use a color picture of it,\" Andy said, kicking thoughtfully\nat an overturned stool.\n\n\"The Felicians are quaint looking, too.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Andy said. \"Put a Felician in the foreground, cobbling.\" He\ntried to sit up.\n\n\"I've seen ads like that in history books,\" Miss Featherpenny said,\nexuding admiration.\n\n\"It's so old it's new,\" Andy said, lying down again. \"Old English\nlettering over the top. A real cliche.\" He considered Miss\nFeatherpenny's ankle. \"Peaceful scenery, Felician shoes?\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" said Miss Featherpenny.\n\n\"Quiet field, Felician shoes?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" said Miss Featherpenny.\n\n\"You're an aggravating woman,\" Andy said sweetly, \"but you do have nice\nlegs.\"\n\n\"What about Elysian fields?\" Miss Featherpenny suggested.\n\nAndy tasted it. \"Elysian fields, Felician shoes.\" He tried to sit up\nagain. \"You got all that down?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Yes,\" Miss Featherpenny lied. She had it in her head, but not on the\nsteno pad.\n\n\"Then get somebody to send it off so we can find out if it's good\nenough. And come back soon.\" He wobbled on his elbow. \"You do have....\"\n\n\"I think I'd better attend to sending it personally.\" Miss Featherpenny\nopened the door. \"You rest until you feel better.\"\n\nBlahrog had gone, but Hrom was waiting for her. She looked more like a\nChristmas fairy than usual. A mischievous one.\n\n\"Did you manage?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Barely.\" Miss Featherpenny looked grim.\n\n\"Drink this,\" Hrom ordered, holding out a mug of Throatduster.\n\nMiss Featherpenny was surprised. \"I thought ladies didn't drink on\nFelix II.\"\n\n\"There are,\" Hrom said, \"exceptions.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next twelve days of waiting for computer results were not as\nhopefully active as the first twelve. The Felicians finished setting up\ntheir manufacturing and storing systems, but they didn't start making\nshoes. The cattle drovers forbore to slaughter the beasts who provided\nthe leather.\n\nThe Everking and his Debators all developed severe cases of\nbeard-itch, a Felician nervous disorder. Since it is even more unseemly\nto scratch on Felix II than it is on Earth, they retired temporarily\nfrom public life.\n\nAndy also retired from public life, biting his fingernails, an Earther\nnervous disorder. Blahrog joined him in the illness, which was new to\nFelicians. By the time the answer from Planetary Promotions came it was\nthe most fashionable habit on the planet, in spite of the fact that\nFelicians have extremely tough nails, and a pair of bony ridges rather\nthan true teeth.\n\nThe second message was also direct from Crumbly. It read: \"Computer\nrates ad campaign at intensity 0.942. P. P. in action by the time you\nreceive this. Stephens ordered back to Home Office; promoted to first\nclass.\"\n\nFour Earth months later, Miss Featherpenny entered Andy's ten by twelve\noffice, her high heels clicking on the plastic tiles, and laid a\nmemorandum on the new steel desk.\n\n\"They've been admitted,\" she announced.\n\n\"What? Who?\" Andy said irritably. There were times when he thought her\nposition as his private secretary had gone to her head.\n\n\"Felix II has been admitted to the Federation. The contract has been\nfulfilled.\" She smiled brightly. \"Shall I mark the file closed?\"\n\n\"Can't yet,\" Andy said. \"Felix II won't be a permanent member of the\nFederation until they've been self-supporting for ten years.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Miss Featherpenny.\n\n\"It's a precautionary measure,\" Andy began to explain. \"Oh, let's go\nget some lunch and forget Felix II.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Stephens,\" Miss Featherpenny said meekly.\n\nHe followed her out the door, admiring the effect of her plastic skirt.\nShe did have nice legs....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree years later, Edith Featherpenny was forced to remember Felix II.\nThere was a communication on her mock-baroque desk. Felician shoes\nweren't selling. Felix II wasn't making enough money. The Galactic\nFederation was threatening to take steps.\n\nShe glanced at the impressive door to the inner office. Andy, she knew,\nwas engaged in reading a letter from his brother Lloyd, who had just\nbeen promoted to vice-president of Universal Products.\n\nShe judiciously forged his initials on an order to put data on the\nFelix II failure through the computer.\n\nIn an hour and a half she had the answer. The Felicians hadn't changed\nthe styles, and their shoes didn't wear out. Everybody had a pair.\n\nShe considered the door again. There was really little sense in\ndisturbing Andy over such a simple matter. She forged his name on a\nmessage to Blahrog. \"Change the styles of your shoes.\"\n\nShe then picked up some carefully selected problem sheets from the top\nof the filing cabinet, and went through the impressive door.\n\nThe next morning, Blahrog's answer was on her desk.\n\n\"Felician shoes are of the cut most suited to the feet that wear them.\nTo change them would be both foolish and unethical.\"\n\nIt was a good thing, Miss Featherpenny thought, that Andy was feeling\nbetter today. She went into his office, padding softly over the carpet\nto his contemporary prestwood desk.\n\n\"Good morning, Edie,\" Andy said cheerfully. \"What happened? Lightning\nstrike you?\"\n\n\"Practically,\" Miss Featherpenny said. \"It's Felix II again.\" She\nhanded over the sheaf of papers.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me about this yesterday?\" Andy muttered, reading\nthem.\n\n\"I thought I could handle it.\" Miss Featherpenny made a face. \"Until I\ngot that answer this morning.\"\n\n\"It sounds like typical Felician thinking,\" Andy said. \"There's no\nsense trying to argue by mail.\" He sighed. \"You'd better reserve a\nfirst-class passage for me on the first ship out.\"\n\n\"Can't I go?\" Miss Featherpenny asked.\n\n\"Who'd run the office?\"\n\n\"The stenos can stack stuff until we get back.\" Miss Featherpenny\nlooked wistful. \"I was in on the beginning of it. I want to see it\nthrough. Besides, I'd like to see Hrom again.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" Andy agreed. \"Make it two first class.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBlahrog was waiting on the long porch of the space port dining room.\n\n\"Have a nice trip?\" he asked.\n\n\"What's all this about not changing the shoe styles?\" Andy countered.\n\n\"As I told you in the message,\" Blahrog said impatiently, \"We make our\nshoes in the best possible shapes for the feet that will wear them.\nThere isn't any good reason to change them.\"\n\n\"You can't sell people two pairs of identical shoes,\" Andy insisted.\n\n\"You might be able to sell them if you changed them,\" Miss Featherpenny\nadded, sounding reasonable.\n\n\"Save your arguments for the Everking,\" Blahrog said. \"Come on to the\ncar.\"\n\n\"Car?\" Miss Featherpenny exclaimed. \"The Everking's?\"\n\n\"No, mine.\" Blahrog couldn't keep the pride out of his voice. \"There\nare nearly two hundred cars on Felix II.\"\n\nAndy went over the same ground in the presence of the Everking. It\ndidn't help. The Everking, his minister and his Debators were solidly\nagainst changing the shoes. The ethics of the Cobblers' Guild were\ninvolved.\n\n\"If you won't follow Planetary Promotions' advice,\" he said at last,\n\"the company can't be responsible for the outcome.\" He glared at the\nassembly. \"In other words, the guarantee clause is cancelled.\"\n\nThere was an indignant and concerned buzz from the audience. Blahrog\ngot up.\n\n\"Your Foreverness,\" he said, \"honorable members of the government, Mr.\nStephens. Three Earth years ago, Felix II gathered together all the\nmoney the government could find, and bought a contract with Planetary\nPromotions.\" He paused and shuffled his feet. \"We did not expect the\ncontract to be fulfilled. We needed money, and two for one would keep\nus going while we attempted to educate the young to be immune to the\ntourists. Of course, if Planetary Promotions found a way for us to be\nself-supporting without tourists, we would be equally pleased.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" Miss Featherpenny murmured.\n\n\"Really,\" Andy said. \"Why didn't you let me in on it?\"\n\nBlahrog cleared his throat to indicate that he wasn't through. \"Since\na way was found,\" he continued, \"Felician self respect and content has\nincreased along with Felician prosperity.\" He glanced uneasily at Andy.\n\"We would like to continue as we are going.\"\n\n\"Unless you change the styles,\" Andy said flatly, \"that is impossible.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMiss Featherpenny, realizing that they were starting over the same\nground, slipped out the door and walked over to visit Hrom.\n\n\"So Papa admitted it,\" Hrom said, after Miss Featherpenny had admired\nthe baby, and been shown over the house. \"I almost told you myself,\nwhen I first met you.\"\n\n\"You told me enough to let me guess the rest,\" Miss Featherpenny said.\n\n\"Have some olgan seed cakes,\" Hrom offered. \"Why didn't you tell Mr.\nStephens?\"\n\nMiss Featherpenny took a cake. \"Partly because of his almighty\nattitude, and partly because I was on your.... Ow!\" She clapped a hand\nhastily to her jaw.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Hrom asked, alarmed.\n\n\"Broke a tooth,\" Miss Featherpenny muttered, her face contorted.\n\n\"Does it hurt much?\" Hrom's question was part sympathy and part\ncuriosity.\n\nMiss Featherpenny nodded. \"I'll have to find a dentist right away.\"\n\n\"What's a dentist?\"\n\n\"Man who fixes your teeth.\"\n\n\"But we don't have teeth,\" Hrom said.\n\n\"I forgot,\" Miss Featherpenny moaned. \"Oh, Lord, I guess I'll have to\ngo all the way back to Earth.\"\n\nHrom shook her head. \"There are a lot of Earthers living on Darius IV.\nThey must have a dentist. There's a ship every morning.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Miss Featherpenny gasped.\n\n\"Can I get you something for the pain? Would an aspirtran help?\"\n\n\"I'd better have two. Thanks.\"\n\n\"Here. Take the bottle with you.\" Hrom was frowning worriedly. \"My, I'm\nglad we don't have teeth.\"\n\n\"I'll have to tell Andy--Mr. Stephens--that I'm leaving.\"\n\nInspiration dawned on Hrom's face. \"I've hardly been out of the house\nsince the baby was born. I'll leave him with my husband's mother and go\nwith you.\"\n\n\"I'd be glad of the company,\" Miss Featherpenny admitted.\n\n\"Good. I'll find out what time the ship leaves, and tell Mother Klagom\nabout the treat she's got coming. You go tell Mr. Stephens and then\ncome back here for the night.\"\n\nMiss Featherpenny heard them shouting before she opened the council\nchamber door.\n\n\"I suggest,\" Andy was saying, \"that you either change the styles or go\nback to the tourist business.\"\n\nShe pushed the door open.\n\n\"Mr. Stephens,\" Blahrog said mildly, \"the last time calamity was upon\nus, you solved the problem by drinking Throatduster until you got an\nidea. May I suggest that you try again?\"\n\n\"Andy,\" Miss Featherpenny whispered.\n\n\"Well?\" he snapped.\n\n\"I broke a tooth. I'm going over to Darius IV tomorrow, with Hrom, to\nhave it fixed.\"\n\n\"Why Darius IV?\" Andy demanded. \"What's the matter with Felician\ndentists?\"\n\n\"What's Hrom going to do with boy?\" Blahrog demanded.\n\n\"Hrom's leaving the baby with Mrs. Klagom,\" Miss Featherpenny answered,\n\"and there aren't any Felician dentists.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Klagom is a silly woman,\" Blahrog disapproved. \"She would do\nbetter to leave him with me.\"\n\n\"If you must, I suppose you must,\" Andy admitted grudgingly. \"Where are\nyou going now?\"\n\n\"Back to Hrom's house to lie down.\"\n\n\"Tell her I'll mind the baby,\" Blahrog called after her.\n\nAs she closed the door, she heard Andy say, \"Gentlemen, if you'll\nsupply the Throatduster, I'll give it a try.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It's awfully quiet,\" Hrom said doubtfully, looking around at the\nFelician spaceport. \"Look at the tannery chimneys. No smoke.\"\n\nMiss Featherpenny, her mouth in good repair, glanced into the bar as\nthey passed it. \"Only two shippers,\" she said. \"There are usually\ndozens.\"\n\n\"They must have stopped production entirely,\" Hrom said.\n\n\"Maybe Andy thought of something.\"\n\n\"I wonder if Papa brought the car down for us.\"\n\nHe hadn't. They walked into town.\n\nBlahrog was in conference with the Everking.\n\n\"I'd better wait for him,\" Miss Featherpenny said. \"I want to find out\nwhat's going on before I talk to Andy.\"\n\n\"I'd better rescue Mother Klagom from the baby.\"\n\nBlahrog was as long-winded as usual.\n\n\"Where is Mr. Stephens?\" Miss Featherpenny demanded, as soon as she saw\nhim coming down the hall.\n\n\"In his old storeroom,\" Blahrog said moodily. \"He's quite drunk, I\nbelieve, but he doesn't seem to be getting any ideas.\"\n\n\"Then why did you stop cobbling?\"\n\nBlahrog did a Felician shrug. \"We're waiting to see what happens.\nThere's no sense making shoes any more if they aren't wanted.\"\n\n\"I have to talk to him,\" Miss Featherpenny said.\n\n\"Do you have an idea?\"\n\n\"No,\" Miss Featherpenny lied. \"But you'd let him drink himself to\ndeath, if he didn't think of anything.\"\n\n\"You want a lift in the car?\" Blahrog asked, uninsulted.\n\n\"I'd be pleased, if you don't mind. I just walked in from the port.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAndy was not, as Blahrog had suggested, very drunk. He was only hung\nover. \"Get your tooth fixed?\" he asked cheerlessly.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good dentist?\"\n\nMiss Featherpenny nodded. \"He had some entirely new equipment.\nExtremely powerful, and quite precise.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Andy straightened in the old arm chair. \"I've been trying to\nthink. And drinking. Throatduster isn't working this time.\" He paused\nto reconsider. \"Except that it makes me drunk. Everything keeps getting\nfuzzy, and my head is wider than my shoulders.\"\n\n\"The dentist said,\" Miss Featherpenny persisted, \"that he could pull a\nwhale's tooth as easily and smoothly as he pulled mine.\"\n\n\"You had to have it pulled? Too bad.\" Andy made a face at the full mug\nof Throatduster on the barrel beside him. \"The Felicians won't change\ntheir minds about the shoes, and they won't try tourists again. I\ncan't think of anything else. And they can claim the guarantee. I was\nbluffing.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Miss Featherpenny said. She tried again. \"The dentist claims\neven the tiniest species could do dental work on the biggest species.\"\nShe paused, hoping it would sink in. \"Providing the tiny species had\nsufficient dexterity.\"\n\n\"Blasted Felicians,\" Andy muttered. \"Stubborn little pigs.\"\n\n\"That's part of their trouble, I think,\" Miss Featherpenny said. \"Being\nlittle, I mean. But it doesn't always work against them. When they're\ndoing delicate work....\"\n\n\"Like those shoes,\" Andy agreed. \"'Best possible shapes already,'\" he\nimitated Blahrog.\n\n\"They're one of the smallest intelligent species,\" Miss Featherpenny\nsaid in desperation. \"And their manual dexterity rating is one of the\nhighest. Why, a Felician could get both hands inside an Earther's\nmouth.\"\n\n\"And steal his fillings....\" Andy started. \"Wait a minute. You've given\nme an idea.\"\n\nMiss Featherpenny breathed relief. \"I have? What is it?\"\n\n\"Dentists! They can all be dentists.\"\n\n\"All?\"\n\n\"Well, enough of them to provide for the planet's income.\"\n\n\"Why, that's marvelous,\" Miss Featherpenny said. \"It won't matter that\nother species think they're cute. Everybody takes dentists seriously.\"\n\n\"Their appearance will work for them,\" Andy said. \"Think of children's\ndentistry.\"\n\n\"Let's go tell them right away,\" Miss Featherpenny said, feeling like a\nBobbsey twin.\n\nAndy swayed upward.\n\n\"Sit still,\" Miss Featherpenny commanded. \"I'll bring you some coffee.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBlahrog accepted the suggestion with Felician phlegm and ministerial\ngreed. \"We'll have to change the tax system, since most of our working\npopulation will be living off-planet.\"\n\n\"Maybe you could work out a rotation system, Papa.\" Hrom had sneaked\ninto the council chamber.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Andy said uneasily. \"How are you going to educate\nthese dentists?\"\n\nBlahrog stopped and thought. \"We'll use the hotels for schools,\" he\nsaid slowly. His face wrinkled with sly pleasure. \"And we can sell the\ncoal surplus to pay teachers and buy equipment.\"\n\nThe Everking made a wicked-sounding comment in Felician.\n\nThe entire assembly burst into loud, beard-wagging laughter. It had a\nnasty ring to it.\n\n\"What did he say?\" Andy demanded.\n\n\"He said,\" Hrom giggled, \"'Let them try to treat us like stuffed toys\nnow.'\"\n\n\"Disgusting,\" said Miss Featherpenny.\n\n\"Indecent, Edie,\" Andy agreed. \"But never mind. Let's go home and get\nmarried.\"\n\n\"You're a little sudden.\"\n\nAndy grinned. \"I'll have a raise coming for this, and I'd like to keep\nyou in the family. I can't seem to think unless you're around.\"\n\n\"Took you long enough to notice,\" said Miss Featherpenny. But she\ndidn't say it out loud.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Satisfaction Guaranteed, by Joy Leache\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SATISFACTION GUARANTEED ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51727.txt or 51727.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/7/2/51727/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
