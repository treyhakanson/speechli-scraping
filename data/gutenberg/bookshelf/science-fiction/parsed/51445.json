His\nfashionably ornate clothes covered the body of a first class Talent.\nDisciplined training, plus drugs and his natural gift, had made him\none of the four truly _developed_ psionic adepts in the world. With\ndrugs and preparation, he could command the entire range of psi powers.\nWithout drugs, he could sense the emotions and sometimes the general\nthought patterns of the people near him.\n\n\"We'd better go with you,\" Lee Shawn said. \"There's an awful lot of\nfear up there. They'll kill you as soon as they learn you're a Talent.\"\n\nShe was a lean, handsome woman in her early forties. A\nlawyer-politician, she was the Guggenheim Foundation's lobbyist. For\nyears she had fought against laws to outlaw the development of Talent.\n\n\"Thanks, Mama, but I think I'd better go alone.\"\n\nSordman, though he didn't tell her, knew that symbolically Lee saw him\nas the tree and herself as the rain and the earth.\n\n\"Go ahead and laugh,\" George Aaron said. \"But you'll need big medicine\nto fight that fear. Lee's symbolic place in your psyche is important.\"\n\n\"I've thought it over,\" Sordman said. \"I'll depend on God and nothing\nelse.\"\n\nHe felt George's mind squirm. As a psychologist, George accepted\nSordman's Zen-Christian faith because Sordman needed it to control the\npowers of his Talent.\n\nBut George himself was a confirmed skeptic.\n\nThe men up there were scared. Sordman knew he would die if he lost\ncontrol. But Lee and George were scared, too. Even now, standing in the\npark in early morning, their fear battered at his mind.\n\nHe thought about swimming in the ocean. He made his skin remember\nsalted wind. The real Atlantic, a mile away, helped the illusion.\n\nIt was the right symbol. He felt his friends calm.\n\n\"Let him go,\" George said.\n\n\"He's manipulating us,\" Lee said.\n\n\"I know. But let him go.\"\n\nSordman laughed. Lee bent and tore a clump of grass from the earth.\n\"Take this, Andy.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nIt was wet with dew. He held it to his nose and smelled the dirt and\ngrass. Two things kept him from destruction by his own Talent. He loved\nthe physical world and he believed in God.\n\n\"I'll call you if I need you,\" he said.\n\n\"Be careful,\" George said. \"Many people need you.\"\n\n\"You've got status,\" Lee said. \"Use it. You're dealing with the kind of\npeople it impresses.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hotel stood three hundred stories tall. Surrounded by a\nfive-mile-square park, connected to the major coastal cities by high\nspeed vacuum tubes, the building was a small town. Eighty-five thousand\npeople lived within its walls.\n\nSordman rode an empty elevator. Through the glass sides he studied the\ndeserted halls and shops.\n\nThey were frightened here. Murder had been done. A Talent had\ndestroyed two men. _Lord, protect us from the malice of a witch._\n\nThe eighty-first was a commercial floor. He got off the vator and\nwalked down the main corridor. A man watched him through the door of a\nbar. A girl in a blue kimono froze behind the counter of a pastry shop.\n\nHe stopped before the doors of the beer hall. He dropped to his knees\nand prayed.\n\nOnce the brave leader walked into a panicky group and it was enough\nto _look_ calm. Now he had to _be_ calm. It was not enough to square\nthe shoulders, walk erect, speak in a confident tone. Sordman's true\nemotions radiated from him every moment. Those within range felt them\nas their own.\n\nHe drove thoughts like knives into the deepest corners of his mind. He\nbegged release from fear. He prayed his God to grant him love for the\nfrightened men within.\n\nHe stood erect and squared his shoulders. His bulb-shouldered morning\ncoat was grey as dawn. He thought a well loved formula, a Buddhist\nprayer from the Book of Universal Worship. _All life is transitory.\nAll people must suffer and die. Let us forgive one another._\n\nHe roared his name and titles at the door.\n\n\"I am Talent Andrew Sordman, Fellow for Life of the Guggenheim\nFoundation, by Senate Act Protector of the People! By the laws of our\ncountry, I ask the right to enter.\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"I am Talent Andrew Sordman, Fellow--\"\n\n\"_Go away, witch!_\"\n\nWithout drugs and preparation, Sordman needed visual contact to sense\nemotions. But he didn't need Talent to sense the hatred in that voice.\n\nHe pictured a rough block of stone.\n\nUsing a basic skill, he kept the picture in his mind as he opened the\ndoor and planned his words.\n\n\"I have taken no drugs and made no preparation. You have nothing to\nfear. I'm your Protector and I've come to talk.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe beer hall was large and gloomy. The butts and ashes of the night's\nsmoking filled its trays. Fourteen men watched him come. Half a dozen\nhad hunting rifles.\n\nHunched over, weeping, a thin, dark-haired girl sat beneath an\nunshaded light. A shiver of anger crossed his brain.\n\n\"Kill the witch!\" a young man shouted.\n\n_Lord, grant me love...._\n\nHis eyes focused on the rifle bearers. One of them half-raised his gun.\nThen the butt clumped on the floor.\n\n\"You're bewitched!\" the young man said. \"I told you not to let him in.\"\n\n\"I've come to talk,\" Sordman said. \"Who's the leader of your group?\"\n\nThe young man said, \"We don't have a leader. Here we're all equals.\"\n\nSordman studied the young man's emotions. He was frightened, but only\na little more than the others. There was something else there, too.\nSomething very strong. Sex frustration! The young man had an athletic\nbody and a handsome, chiselled face. On his yellow vest he wore the\nemblem of a Second Class Technician. But even a young man with adequate\nfinances could be frustrated. Keeping the stone in his mind, he\nundressed a certain actress.\n\nHe loved women and engaged in sex with lusty, triumphant joy. To him it\nwas a celebration of the sacred mystery of life. He hoped some of this\nemotion reached its target.\n\nHe started talking without asking for a parley.\n\n\"Two men died yesterday. I've come to hunt out the murderer and put him\naway. What's the evidence against this girl?\"\n\n\"We found drugs and a divining rod in her room.\"\n\n\"She's had a reputation for a long time.\"\n\n\"The school kids say she's a daydreamer.\"\n\nSordman understood their fear. Psi was a new and dangerous force.\nIts use demanded moral and intellectual discipline. Only a rare and\ncarefully developed personality could encounter the anger, hostility\nand fear in other minds and still retain compassion and reasonable\nrespect for human beings. An undisciplined person panicked and went\ninto a mental state approaching paranoia. Sordman fought panic every\nday. He fought it with a total acceptance of human motivations,\ncultivated tenderness and compassion, and a healthy ego which could\naccept and enjoy its own self-love.\n\nThose things, Sordman would have said, and also the necessary grace of\nGod.\n\nBut the most undisciplined personality could practice psi\ndestructively. Hostile minds roamed the world. Death could strike you\nin a clear field beneath an open sky while your murderer lay home in\nhis bed. No wonder they dragged a girl from her parents and bullied her\ntill dawn.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey talked. Sordman picked his way through fourteen minds. As always,\nhe found what he wanted.\n\nA fat, redheaded man sat a little apart from the group. He radiated a\nspecial kind of concern. He was concerned for the girl and for his own\nchildren. He believed the actions of the night had been necessary, but\nhe felt the girl's pain and he wasn't sure he was doing the right thing.\n\nAbove all, he was a man who wanted to do the right thing--the really\nright thing.\n\n\"You all have children,\" Sordman said. \"Would you like to see them\ndragged out at night and treated the way you've treated this girl?\"\n\n\"We've got to protect ourselves!\" the young man said.\n\n\"Let him talk!\" the fat man growled. He stared at the thick hands he\nspread on the table. \"The girl has said all night she's innocent. Maybe\nshe is. Maybe the Protector can do what we haven't done and find the\nreal killer.\"\n\n\"I'm a master Talent,\" Sordman said. \"If the killer is in the hotel, I\ncan track him down before midnight. Will you give me that long?\"\n\n\"How do we know you'll bring in the right man?\"\n\n\"If he's the right man, he'll make it plain enough.\"\n\n\"You'll make him confess,\" the young man said. \"You'll manipulate him\nlike a puppet.\"\n\n\"What good will that do?\" Sordman said. \"Do you think I could control a\nman all the time he's in prison and on trial? If I use my Talent more\nthan a few hours, I collapse.\"\n\n\"Can we hold the girl here?\" asked the redheaded fat man.\n\n\"Feed her and treat her right,\" Sordman said. \"What's your name?\"\n\n\"John Dyer. My friends were about to use their belts on her.\"\n\nA rifleman shuffled uneasily. \"It's the only way. Mind killers use\ntheir Talent to tie their tongues and confuse us. Only pain can break\ntheir control.\"\n\n\"That's a fairy tale,\" Sordman said. \"Without drugs a Talent is\nhelpless.\"\n\n\"We've got the girl,\" John Dyer said. \"She can't hurt us while we're\nwaiting.\"\n\n\"_He can!_\" the young man screamed. \"Are you a plain fool? He can go\noutside and kill us all.\"\n\nSordman laughed. \"Sure I could. And tomorrow I'd have to fight off\nan army. That I couldn't do if I was fool enough to try. You're\nfrightened, boy. Use your head.\"\n\n\"You are excited, Leonard,\" said an armed man. He wore a blue morning\ncoat with Manager's stars and the emblem of a transportation company.\n\"We can wait a day. If we've got the killer, then we're safe. If we\ndon't, then we've failed and the Protector should try.\"\n\n\"I'm not frightened. I just don't like Talent.\"\n\nMost of the men frowned. They didn't share the prejudice. A few nodded\nand mumbled and shot dark glances at Sordman.\n\nHe let them talk. He stood there and thought apple pies and the\nbrotherhood of man and the time he and his second wife spent three days\nin bed. And the big block of stone.\n\nHe was a high-powered transmitter broadcasting joy, good will toward\nmen and tranquility.\n\nIn the end they listened to Dyer.\n\n\"But don't think you'll get a minute past midnight,\" said the young man.\n\n\"Technician, your Protector will remember.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClarke Esponito had been a hard, quick little man in his early fifties.\nOn the day of his death, the hotel newspaper had published his\npicture and announced his promotion to Director of Vocational Testing\nfor the entire Atlantic Region. He had lived with his wife and his\nnineteen-year-old son, and his wife had been a lifetime wife. Esponito\nhad been a Catholic, and that faith still called short-term marriages a\nmortal sin.\n\nFor a moment Sordman wondered what it would be like to know only one\nwoman your entire life. He loved the infinite variety of God's creation\nand wanted to sample as much of it as he could.\n\n\"Mylady Widow, our apologies.\" Lee bowed, hands before her chest, and\nSordman and George Aaron bowed with her. \"We intrude on you,\" Lee said,\n\"only because we have to find the real killer. Other people may be in\ndanger.\"\n\nThe Widow Esponito bowed in return.\n\n\"I understand, Politician Shawn.\"\n\nEven with her face scarred by tears she looked lovely. From the\nearliest years of their marriage, her husband had been high in the\nCivil Service and able to buy her beauty treatments.\n\n\"Mylady,\" Sordman said, \"I need your help for two things. We want to\nknow who you think wanted to kill your husband. And we need your want.\"\n\n\"Our want?\" her son asked. He stood rigidly beside his mother's chair.\nHis clothes were rich and formal tweed.\n\n\"Do you want to find the killer?\"\n\nThe boy nodded soberly. \"The moment I heard of his murder, I promised\nto avenge him.\"\n\n\"John!\" His mother trembled. \"You were raised to be a Christian!\"\n\nSordman said, \"I want to locate the image I think was used to kill\nhim. For that I want to hook your strong desires into my thoughts. You\nwon't know I'm doing it. But if you're near me, I'll use your emotions.\"\n\n\"Your husband was a very important man,\" Lee said. \"Would anyone gain\nby his death?\"\n\n\"Everyone liked my husband. He was always laughing, he--\" The old-young\nwoman started crying. Her son put his arm around her shoulders.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSordman felt her pain and winced. Death and pain were part of Creation,\nbut he hated them and often cursed them. At times like these, he\nunderstood George's skepticism.\n\nThe boy said, \"Manager Kurt didn't like him.\"\n\nMylady stifled her sobs and sat up. \"Manager Kurt has been our guest\nevery month. Protector, John's upset. He's talking wildly.\"\n\n\"Father told me. He said Manager Kurt didn't like him.\"\n\n\"Your father and the Manager were good friends.\"\n\nHe felt a sudden resentment in the woman. Why? The boy didn't feel as\nif he was lying. Maybe Esponito had been the kind of man who didn't\ntalk about his job with his wife. But his son--who would some day be\na member of his father's class--would have received a certain amount\nof practical advice. Perhaps Mylady resented being left out of her\nhusband's professional life. That was a common family pattern, after\nall.\n\nGeorge felt impatient. Sordman shot him a questioning glance. \"Where\ndoes Manager Kurt live?\"\n\n\"In Baltimore,\" the boy said.\n\n\"Mylady, may we use your phone?\"\n\n\"You don't take John seriously?\" Mylady said.\n\n\"We'll have to ask the Baltimore police to check on the Manager. It may\nnot mean anything, but we have to follow every lead.\"\n\n\"Use the phone, Protector.\"\n\nSordman and George stepped into the dining room.\n\n\"We're wasting time,\" George said. \"They're both upset and there seems\nto be a family quarrel.\"\n\n\"I know. But Esponito's murder gives us more leads than Bedler's.\nBedler didn't even have a one-month wife when he died. Lots of people\nknew the Administrator and might have had a grudge against him.\"\n\nGeorge clasped his hands behind his back. \"We've unraveled twenty-three\nmurders in the last four years. Judging by that experience, I'd say\nthere are three possibilities: both victims were picked at random; both\nvictims are in some way related; or one victim was killed to confuse\nthe police.\"\n\n\"Unless we have something entirely new.\"\n\n\"That's been the pattern so far.\"\n\n\"I think we're both coming to the same conclusion.\"\n\n\"Find out if the murderer used the picture from the paper?\"\n\n\"Mmm. If he did, Administrator Esponito was probably attacked on the\nspur of the moment. And we should be seeing who wanted to kill Bedler.\"\n\n\"What about Manager Kurt?\"\n\n\"Have Lee call the Baltimore police while I try to locate the murder\nweapon. At least they can search his home for drugs.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGeorge went back to the parlor and Sordman stripped to his yellow vest.\nFrom the pockets of his morning coat he removed a leather case and a\ntiny plastic package. Unfolded, the plastic became a thin red robe with\na yellow bomb-burst on the back.\n\nHe called it his battle robe. Habit played a big part in the\ndevelopment of Talent. The same clothing, the same ritualized\nmovements, helped put his mind in the proper state.\n\nHe filled a hypodermic with a pink liquid and jabbed the needle into\nhis wrist. As the drug took effect, he knelt to pray.\n\n\"Grant me, God, the strength to bind the demons in my mind.\"\n\nHe stood up. At this point many Talents danced. Sordman loved to use\nhis body, but ritual dancing made him feel ridiculous. It had been\nproven, however, that the Power flowed at its freest when the body was\noccupied, so he took three colored balls from the case and started\njuggling.\n\nThe balls soared higher and faster. He mumbled a hymn. His voice grew\nstronger. He roared his love of life at the world.\n\nThe wall between his conscious and unconscious mind collapsed.\nLightning flashed in his eyes. Colors sang in his brain. Walls, floor,\ntable, chairs became extensions of his mind. They danced with the balls\nbetween his hands. The Universe and he flowed together like a sea of\nmolten iron.\n\nHis hands, miles from his mind, fumbled in the case. The balls danced\nand bobbed in the air. He laughed and unfolded his divining rod. The\nfurniture bounced. Mylady Esponito screamed.\n\nAll Creation is a flow. Dance, you parts of me, you living things, you\natoms of my dust!\n\nHe had torn Esponito's photo from a newspaper. Now he let the colored\nballs drop and stuck the picture on the end of the rod.\n\n\"This and that are one in kind. Servant rod, find me that!\"\n\nHe stretched out the rod and turned on his heels. He sang and blanked\nhis mind and listened to the tremors in his hands.\n\nStop. Back right. Now the left. Too far. Down. Correct left....\n\nHere!\n\nHe pressed a button on the rod. A tripod sprang out. A pair of sights\nflipped up. Carefully he sighted down the rod, out through the\nwindow-wall beside the table, to a grove of trees in the park.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCreation roaring in his open head, divining rod in hand, he stormed\nout the door and down the hall. Lee and George hurried after him. The\npresence of their well known minds pleased him. There was George's\nunexpressed belief that he had \"mastered\" and guided the Power he\nfeared. There was Lee's worry for him and her keen awareness of\nhuman realities. And there, too, were self-discipline, intelligence,\naffection, and a richness of experience and thought he expected to draw\non for another forty years.\n\nAnd filling the world, pounding on the walls of existence, the Power.\n_His_ power. He, the master of the world! He who could uproot the\ntrees, spin the earth, make the ground shake and change the colors of\nthe sky.\n\nHe felt George's clear-eyed, good-humored tolerance. A hypnotic command\ntriggered in his mind. He saw a Roman Caesar ride in triumph and the\nslave behind him said, \"Caesar, remember you are mortal.\"\n\n_My_ power? It is a gift from the Fountain of Creation. Mine to use\nwith the wisdom and restraint implanted by my teachers. Or else I'll\nbe destroyed by _my_ power.\n\nHe laughed and rolled into a cannon ball and hurled his body through\nthe wood.\n\n\"Andy! Andy, you're losing us!\"\n\nHe picked them up and towed them with him. The girl in the beer hall\ncried in his heart. The fox is many hills away and the hound grows\nimpatient.\n\nThey landed in a heap.\n\nGeorge said, \"Andy, what the hell are you doing?\"\n\n\"I brought you down in a soft spot.\"\n\n\"You felt like an elephant running amok! Boy, you've got to be careful.\nSince you were a little boy I've taught you to watch every move. For a\nmoment I don't think you knew how you felt.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" Sordman mumbled. \"That was close.\"\n\n\"Let's find the picture,\" Lee said. \"Has the drug worn off?\"\n\n\"Just about. The picture's over by that tree. It feels like it's\nrumpled up.\"\n\nAfter a minute's hunt, they found it. It had been rolled into a ball\nand tossed away.\n\n\"We're dealing with an amateur,\" Lee said. \"A Talent who was even\nhalf-developed would have burned this.\"\n\nUnrolled, the picture fell in half. It had been sliced with a blade.\n\n\"Let's walk back,\" Sordman said. \"Let's talk.\"\n\nThey crossed a log bridge. He ran his hands along the rough bark\nand smelled the cool water of the stream. Most of the big park was\nwilderness, but here and there were pavilions, an outdoor theatre, open\nplaying fields and beautifully planned gardens. A man could have a home\nsurrounded by the shops and pleasures of civilized living and yet only\nbe a ten-minute elevator ride from God's bounty.\n\n\"The fact the killer used the newspaper picture doesn't _prove_ Bedler\nwas the real victim,\" George said. \"But it indicates it.\"\n\n\"Let's assume it's true,\" Sordman said, \"and see where it leads us.\"\n\n\"Bedler was married,\" Lee said. \"I remember that from our briefing.\"\n\nSordman rabbit-punched a tree as he passed it. \"It was a one-year\ncontract, and it ended two weeks ago.\"\n\n\"I smell jealousy,\" Lee said.\n\n\"The world is filled with it,\" George said. \"I favor short-term\nmarriages. They're the only way a person can practice a difficult art\nand make mistakes without committing himself for life. But about half\nthe mental breakdowns I used to get were due to the insecurities caused\nby a temporary contract. One party almost always hopes the marriage\nwill somehow become permanent.\"\n\n\"Let's talk to Bedler's ex-wife,\" Sordman said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer name was Jackie Baker. She was just over five feet tall and blonde.\nShe wore glasses with green frames.\n\nSordman liked big women but he had to admit this little creature made\nhim feel like swatting and rubbing.\n\nShe wore a sea-green kimono and bowed gracefully at the door.\n\n\"Citizen Baker, I'm Protector Andrew Sordman. May we talk to you?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Protector. Welcome.\"\n\nThey entered and he introduced Lee and George. After they exchanged\nbows, the girl offered them some wine. She took a bottle of clear Rhine\nwine from the cooler and asked George to open it. There were several\njournals on a throw table.\n\n\"Are you a doctor, Citizen?\" Lee asked.\n\n\"No, Politician. A medical technician.\"\n\nThey drank the first glass of wine.\n\n\"Technician,\" George said, \"we have to ask you some questions. We'll\ntry not to upset you.\"\n\nThe girl closed her eyes. \"I'll try not to be upset. I hope you find\nwhoever killed him. I'd like to find her.\"\n\nThe girl felt lonely. She ached with unsatisfied needs. I'd like to\nlie with you and comfort you, Sordman thought. I'd like to hold you in\nmy arms and drain all the tears you're holding back. But he couldn't.\nHis contract with his wife had six months to run and no one committed\nadultery any more. \"When the rules are carefully tailored to human\nneeds,\" Lee often said, \"there's no excuse for breaking them.\"\n\n\"Why 'her'?\" Lee asked. \"Why 'her' instead of 'him'?\"\n\nThe girl looked at Sordman. \"Can't you just probe my mind? Do I have to\nanswer questions?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so,\" Sordman said. \"My Talent has its limits. I can't\ndeep-probe everybody's mind, any more than a baseball pitcher can pitch\nall day.\"\n\nLee said, \"Even if he could, our warrant says we can't probe more than\nfour suspects.\"\n\n\"Now can you tell us why you think the killer is a woman?\" George asked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl held out her glass and George filled it. \"Because he was the\nkind of man who made you want to kill him. He was understanding and\nloving. He made me feel like a princess all the time I lived with him.\nBut he can't keep to one girl.\" She gulped down the whole glass. \"He\ntold me so himself. He was so wonderful to live with I went insane\nevery time he looked at another girl. I knew he was shopping for his\nnext wife.\" She wiggled in her chair. \"Is that what you want to know?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Sordman said. \"Do you know who he was interested in before\nhe died?\"\n\nThe girl had big, myopic eyes. \"Our contract ended sixteen days ago.\"\nShe took a cigarette from inside her kimono. \"Protector Sordman, could\nI just talk to you?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Sordman said.\n\nLee and George went to a coffee house on the next floor down.\n\n\"I want to talk to just you,\" the girl said. \"I feel safe with you. You\nmake me feel right.\"\n\n\"It goes with being a Talent,\" Sordman said. \"Either we like people and\nlet them know it or we crack.\"\n\n\"I know it's all right to tell you things. I love Joe. I broke the\nrules for him. I didn't avoid him for three months the way you're\nsupposed to. I went everywhere I knew he'd be. I had to see him.\"\n\nSordman stroked his beard. Mentally, he cuddled her in his arms and\nmurmured comfort to her.\n\nShe hunched her shoulders and wrapped her arms around her body.\n\n\"Just before our marriage ended, I found out he was seeing Raven\nEnglish as much as he could. He didn't break the rules. But when we\nwent to dances he always danced with her once or twice. And she and\nher husband used to meet us in bars. After the contract expired, he\ncouldn't see her much because she and her husband have another six\nmonths to go. But there was a dance last week and I saw the two of them\ndisappear into the park. Raven's husband hunted all over for her. He\nlooked horrible. I pitied him.\"\n\n\"Who's Raven English?\"\n\n\"She's a sadist. I know she is. She's just the type to do this. She\nlikes to play with men and hurt them. Her poor husband is a nervous\nwreck. I know she killed Joe, Protector. She hates us!\"\n\nHe stood up. The girl watched him with big eyes. He put his hand on her\nhead.\n\n\"Sleep is a joy,\" he said.\n\nUnprepared, he couldn't have done that to many people. But she was a\nwoman, which added to his influence, and totally exhausted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe got off the vator and looked around for the coffee house. Dozens of\npeople wandered the halls and the shops. As he walked down the hall,\nsome of them looked away or got as far from him as they could. Others\nignored him or found his presence reassuring or studied him curiously.\n\nA fat woman in a black kimono walked toward him. She had one hand on\nher hip and her eyes were narrowed and hard. Sordman smiled. He felt\nher fear and distrust, and her determination not to let such emotions\nconquer her.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Protector.\"\n\n\"Good afternoon, Citizen Mother.\"\n\nHe felt her triumph and her pleasure with herself.\n\nHis fellow humans often made him gawk in wonder. Some people say we're\npsychic cripples, he thought. And maybe we are. But we do our work and\nwe enjoy ourselves. And we do dangerous things like putting bases on\nVenus and falling in love. Surrounded by death and danger, crippled\nthough we are, we go on.\n\nHe swelled with feeling. People smiled and glanced at each other or hid\nshyly from the organ chords of his emotion.\n\nAn old man stepped in front of him.\n\n\"Monster! Freak!\"\n\nHe was thin and perfectly dressed. Sordman stopped. God of Infinite\nCompassion, this is my brother....\n\n\"They ought to lock you up,\" the man said. \"They ought to keep you away\nfrom decent people. Get out of my head! Leave me alone!\"\n\nPeople stared at them. A small crowd gathered. Lee appeared in the door\nof the coffee house.\n\n\"It's all right,\" Sordman told the people. \"It's all right.\" He started\nto go on.\n\nThe man stepped in front of him. \"Leave me alone, freak. Let me think\nmy own thoughts!\"\n\n\"Citizen, I haven't touched your mind.\"\n\n\"I felt it just then!\"\n\n\"It was no more than I could help. I'm sorry if I've hurt you.\"\n\n\"Go away!\"\n\n\"I'm trying to.\"\n\n\"Murderer! Mind witch!\"\n\nHe was faced with a strong mind that valued its independence. Anything\nhe did would be detected and resented.\n\n\"Citizens,\" he said, \"this man deserves your respect. No matter what\na man does, he's bound to offend someone. This Citizen values his\nprivacy--which is good--and therefore I make him angry. I hope the good\nmy Talent lets me do outweighs the bad. Forgive me, brother.\"\n\nHe stepped to one side. \"Leave him alone,\" someone said. \"Let the\nProtector work.\"\n\n\"Leave him alone, old man.\"\n\n\"_I'm not an old man._\"\n\n\"No, you're not,\" Sordman said. \"I admire your courage.\" He walked on.\nBehind him the old man shouted curses.\n\n\"Are you all right?\" Lee said.\n\n\"Sure. Let's go in and sit down.\"\n\nThere were just a few people in the coffee house. Sordman ordered and\ntold them what he had learned.\n\n\"I wish you could probe everyone in the building,\" George said. \"All we\nget is gossip.\"\n\n\"The husband of this Raven English has a motive,\" Lee said. \"Why don't\nwe visit her?\"\n\n\"I think we should.\" Sordman drank his coffee. \"Citizen English\nherself might have killed them.\"\n\n\"I doubt it,\" George said.\n\n\"It all sounds like a lot of talk,\" Sordman said. \"But we have to\nfollow it up. This business is nothing but wearing out your legs\nrunning after every lead. If your legs are strong, you can run anybody\ndown.\"\n\nThey finished their coffee and cigarettes and trudged out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRaven English, one-year wife of Leonard Smith, did not meet them at the\ndoor with gracious bows. Instead, a wall panel by the door shot back.\nThey stared at a square of one way glass.\n\n\"Who are you?\" a girl's voice said.\n\n\"I'm Andrew Sordman, your Protector. I come on lawful business. May we\nenter?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Lee asked.\n\n\"Because I don't like witches. Keep out.\"\n\n\"We're hunting the killer,\" Sordman said. \"We're on your side. I've\ntaken no drugs and made no preparations. You don't have to be afraid.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid. I just don't want you in my home.\"\n\n\"You have to let us in,\" Lee said. \"Our warrant gives us entry into\nevery room in this hotel. If we have to break the door down, we can.\"\n\n\"I hope we don't have to break the door down.\"\n\n\"You're getting fat,\" George said. \"You need the exercise.\"\n\n\"You won't break in,\" the girl said.\n\nSordman crossed the hall to get a good start. \"I'm about to, Mylady.\"\nHis shoulder filled the doorway behind him. This looks like fun, he\nthought. He liked to feel his body working.\n\nThe door opened. A dark-haired, slender girl stood in the doorway. Her\nskin was brown and her lips were pink, unpainted flesh. She wore a red\nkimono.\n\n\"All right. Come in.\"\n\n\"Gladly,\" Sordman said.\n\nIt was a three-room apartment, with the kitchen tucked into one wall of\nthe parlor. A painting stood on an easel by the window. The window was\na shoulder-high slit and from it, here on the hundred and forty-first\nfloor, he could see across the park to the beach and the rolling\nAtlantic.\n\nGod grant me self-control, he thought. If this is the killer, grant me\nself-control. He made his savage thoughts lie down and purred at the\nworld.\n\n\"I'm sorry we have to force our way in,\" he said. \"And I'm sorry you\ndon't approve of Talent. But please remember two men have died and a\nlittle girl may die, too. There are lots of panicky people in the Mark\nTwain. We've got to find the killer soon and you can help us.\"\n\n\"Why bother me?\" the girl said.\n\n\"This is awkward,\" Lee said. She stood erect but looked past the girl.\nShe felt embarrassed. \"Someone told us you and Bedler were seeing each\nother.\"\n\n\"Oh, quit being prudish,\" George said. \"These things happen all the\ntime.\" He turned to the girl. \"We were told you and Joe Bedler were\nmaking plans to get married when your present contract ends.\"\n\n\"That's a lie!\"\n\nSordman laughed in his belly. No matter what the rules were, few women\npublicly admitted they had broken them. By the standards of the period\nfrom 1800 to 1990, the whole marriage system of the Twenty-First\nCentury was immoral; but there were still prudes. And women still\npreserved the conventions.\n\n\"Who told you that?\" Raven English said. She frowned. \"Was it that\nJackie Baker?\"\n\n\"Why her?\" George asked.\n\n\"Because she's a logical person for you to talk to and because it's the\nkind of thing she'd say.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Sordman said.\n\n\"She ought to see a psycher! And that's why you came?\"\n\n\"We're not accusing you,\" Sordman said. \"But we've got to follow every\nlead.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl swore. \"Why would I kill Joe? Why are you all suspicious?\nThat's why I hate Talents! All you've done is make everyone\nsuspicious. Everybody's afraid of everybody else.\"\n\n\"Are you an artist?\" Sordman asked.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Are you an artist?\"\n\n\"What's that got to do with it? No, I'm not. My husband paints.\"\n\nHe felt her stall and evade. She would grab at any subject to distract\nthem. He decided he would let his mind probe at random.\n\n\"Is he a professional painter?\" Lee asked.\n\n\"No, he's an engineer. They wouldn't let him go to art school. He's\ntrying to teach himself.\" She shrugged and ogled the ceiling.\n\nHer emotions said, Men are like that.\n\n\"What does your husband think of Talent?\" Sordman asked. \"Does he share\nyour prejudice?\"\n\n\"Didn't you meet Len?\"\n\n\"Where?\" He stroked his beard. \"Is he the Len downstairs in the beer\nhall?\"\n\n\"Of course!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I didn't make the connection.\"\n\nHe felt two other minds run like hounds down the same trail.\n\nLee studied the painting. \"Why does your husband hate Talent?\"\n\n\"Is this a survey?\"\n\nLee grinned. \"I'm the lobbyist for the Guggenheim Foundation. Asking\nthat kind of question is a reflex.\"\n\nThe girl walked around the room. She looked out the window and\nstretched. Sordman bellowed lust at her flanks and the long curve of\nher hips.\n\n\"Why do men do anything?\" Raven yawned. \"When he was in Voc school some\nkid took him in the back room and showed him some tricks. Maybe that\ndid it. Is there a psycher in the house?\"\n\n\"There is,\" George said. \"Is Citizen Smith an astronautical engineer?\"\n\n\"You could say so. He works on instruments for space labs.\"\n\n\"That's funny.\" George stared at the sun flashing on the far-off ocean.\n\"I remember I felt bitter once because I couldn't be a space engineer.\nI wanted to build rockets and ride to the planets. But the Voc people\ntold me I was too weak in math. So I became a healer of the psyche and\nI learned my love for rockets was a hunger for power. But still I love\nthe brutes and now I'm an old man I still sometimes wish I'd been an\nengineer.\"\n\n\"That's too bad,\" the girl said politely.\n\n\"Yes. I suppose your husband feels that way about art?\"\n\n\"He gets drunk about it sometimes.\"\n\n\"Double motive!\" Sordman said.\n\n\"One conscious,\" George said, \"plain jealousy. The other\nhalf-conscious--resentment. Nobody kills at random. There's always a\nreason why he took these lives instead of others.\"\n\n\"Plus a lot of self-pity,\" Lee said, \"and I think his wife despises\nhim.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Raven said. \"What did you say about me?\"\n\n\"We think we've got a suspect,\" Sordman said.\n\n\"I didn't do it!\"\n\n\"I'm going to probe your husband.\"\n\n\"My husband hates Talent.\"\n\n\"We have to hurry,\" Sordman said. \"If your husband's innocent, I'm\nsorry. We're not saying he's guilty. But I have to examine him.\"\n\nAt the door he paused and thought, God of Infinite Compassion.... The\ngirl sat down and stared at the wall.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMany drugs activate the psi powers. The commonest, available in any\ndrug store, is a pill of codeine and half a dried peyote bean. Leonard\nSmith had both in his pocket when he ran out the side door of the beer\nhall.\n\nSordman swore wildly. The girl screamed. The men, the hunters of\nwitches and killers, either froze or shouted and ran to the door. Only\nJohn Dyer and two others ran shouting down the hall.\n\nSordman ran to the door and saw Smith leap into the elevator. He\ngrabbed a wall phone and dialed the Manager's office.\n\n\"We've got the killer,\" he shouted. \"His name's Leonard Smith. He's\na young man, dark, wiry, good looking, and he's on the elevator going\ndown.\"\n\n\"We'll get him!\"\n\n\"Leave him alone! I saw him swallow something as he left. I think he's\ndrugged. Clear the lobby but watch him from hiding. I'll get him before\nhe goes far.\"\n\nJohn Dyer trudged back to the beer hall. \"Give me your rifle,\" he told\nan armed man. Before the man could say anything Dyer snatched the rifle\nfrom him.\n\n\"All right,\" Dyer said. \"Who's going with me?\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" Sordman said. \"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"After Smith.\"\n\n\"I'm going after him. Let him go and I'll have him out cold before an\nhour's up.\"\n\n\"There isn't anything a rifle can't stop.\"\n\nSordman understood. These men were afraid of Talent. But some, like\nDyer, had to fight that fear. They had to prove that intelligence\nand the technical power organized society gives individual men were\nsuperior to Talent.\n\n\"I can't stop you,\" Sordman said. \"But listen to me. Smith has to be\ncaptured alive. The man is insane. He's no more a villain than you or\nme. He just tampered with a force he couldn't control. You might stop\nhim with a bullet but you'll have to kill him to do it.\"\n\n\"He killed two of us,\" a man said.\n\n\"He's drugged. He can hide and kill you from a distance.\"\n\n\"So can we,\" Dyer said. \"That's what we do with rifles.\"\n\nSordman ran his fingers through his hair. \"Stay under cover then. And\nif I get him pacified, let him live.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe wall phone buzzed.\n\n\"Sordman.\"\n\n\"This is the Manager. He stole a hatchet in the leisure store. He's out\nin the park.\"\n\n\"Did anybody try to stop him?\"\n\n\"I cleared the place out.\"\n\n\"Some of your tenants are going after him. Don't let anybody else join\nthem. I wish myself they wouldn't go.\"\n\nAfter he hung up the three of them went up a floor and rang the buzzer\nof a one-tenant apartment. As politely as they could, Lee and George\nbundled the occupant out.\n\n\"I wish you'd let the state police capture him,\" George said.\n\n\"I've got to get to him before they kill him,\" Sordman said.\n\n\"Andy, there are limits to what you can take! Smith has gone berserk.\nYou connect with an insane man and you may shatter all over the place.\"\n\nSordman stroked his beard.\n\n\"Let him go,\" Lee said. \"Can't you feel he has to do this?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I won't admit it. I trained you, Andy. You're my life's\nwork. I don't want you to wreck yourself.\"\n\nSordman nodded soberly. \"I know, George. I'll take care of myself.\" He\nthought tender thoughts and tried to make them feel how much he loved\nthem.\n\n\"Let's go,\" Lee mumbled. \"Come on, George.\"\n\nHe closed the door gently. The window of the apartment overlooked the\npark. He stared at the thick trees and wondered where Smith was running\nunder that green roof. Then he turned to the picture phone and punched\nout a number.\n\nThe screen lit. It was in full color, praise God.\n\n\"_Andy!_\"\n\nHis wife smiled when she saw him. She was a big girl with long breasts\nand full thighs. She wore a dark kimono.\n\nShe bowed. \"Good afternoon, Husband.\"\n\n\"Good afternoon, Wife.\" He pressed his palms together and returned the\nbow.\n\n\"Why are you calling, Andy?\"\n\n\"Because I love you. And I want to ask you a favor, Tina.\"\n\n\"What, Husband?\"\n\n\"Will you undress for me now?\"\n\n\"Andy! My, my, my.\"\n\nHe explained the situation to her. \"Be careful,\" she said. \"I love you.\"\n\n\"I'll be careful. But I've got to be aware of myself as a physical\nbeing. You understand.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"May I take my time?\"\n\n\"Not too long.\"\n\nShe was an uninhibited girl and took great pleasure in displaying\nherself. Her skin was pure white and her stomach smooth and softly\nrounded. He could feel the weight of her breasts on his palm.\n\n\"God is good,\" he said.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nHis glands flooded his body. His body ached to stroke, squeeze, kiss,\npenetrate.\n\n\"You'd better go,\" he said. \"Before I break the screen down.\"\n\nShe bowed. \"Live with God, Husband.\"\n\n\"Live with God, Wife.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe screen faded. He put on his robe and jabbed the hypodermic into his\nwrist. Then he knelt to pray.\n\nHe did not pray for power. Intelligence and hard work could give him\nthat. He prayed for mercy, compassion, recognition of his own flawed\nnature. He prayed for courage and the end of fear.\n\nThe balls danced between his hands. He sang the Song of Praise, the\nlove song to the world. _Gloria mundi._ Glory in the world, glory in\nthe flesh, glory in the flow of life. Creation is a flow and man a\nbubble bouncing on the flow. Bubble that will burst but bubble that\nis. Bubble that feels, strives, blends with other bubbles.\n\nBubble that can fill Creation!\n\nHe roared at the walls of existence. His mind yawned and stretched and\ncame awake. He prowled across the woods and parks. Gigantic, he gazed\nat the mortals who stumbled through the shaded tunnels of the world.\nThese are such as me. These share my doomed existence.\n\nAnd that one? That one lying in the brush with an axe? That one,\npreparing to kill, clawing since he was a baby at a world that torments\nhim?\n\nThat also is me.\n\nSmith rose to his knees and swung the axe. John Dyer crumpled with\na severed spine. The axe swung twice and two men fell. The hunters\ndropped to their bellies. Rifles cracked. Bullets sang in the grass.\n\nNow they knew they had to kill Smith or die. Now they felt no mercy.\n\nSordman hovered over them. What he feels, I will feel. His hate will be\nmy hate. His anger mine. His hate must be absorbed in great compassion,\nin tenderness and rationality. _Or I will be destroyed with him._\n\nIn the room the balls spun and whirled. He lay prostrate on the floor,\nthe yellow bomb-burst on his back. He was afraid. His weakness was\nnaked. He had always known he would someday meet a personality he\ncould not forgive. When that day came he would shatter and flee, like\nSmith, to any refuge he could make.\n\n\"Show your heads! Show your heads and I'll kill you!\"\n\nA bullet smashed into Smith's leg. He screamed and flailed the axe.\nShouting curses and threats, he crawled through the brush. The hunters\ncrawled after him.\n\nSordman located Smith. He shuddered as malice bit the edges of his\nmind. He sang a long note of praise to life.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen he opened his mind.\n\nListen, Smith. I'm your friend. I am Sordman, the Protector of all, of\nthe hunters and the hunted. I come in love. I am Sordman, small brother\nof the Lord, bubble in the Fountain of Creation....\n\nOnce men had thought a Talent would fell his opponents with a blast\nof mental energy. It wasn't that easy. Sordman had to find the cause\nof Smith's hate. He was no rifleman, hurling a blast of energy, but a\nsurgeon probing for the source of a disease.\n\nTwo minds tangled. Sordman bore the light of himself into darkness.\n\n--I'll kill you, too. Get out of me. Get out!\n\nSnarl, growl, slash. Two minds linked as one. Sordman fighting Sordman,\nSmith fighting Smith.\n\n_Aaaaaaaah!_\n\nHe doubled up on the floor and hugged his knees. The Protector wept and\nsobbed. Hate! How he hated hate. How he wanted to kill the haters. They\nclawed his brain, they tortured every moment, and yet he had to love\nthem. _Love them!_\n\nGod, grant your servant strength. Be merciful....\n\nHe had lost his contact but he had to go back. Weak man or not, he had\nto return or Smith would die.\n\n--I'll kill them all.\n\nHe saw the hunters creeping after him. He felt his body's dirty sweat\nand the blood draining on his leg. Run, said his belly. A hunter fired.\nHe saw a blue morning coat in the bush and felt the gun pointed at his\nhead. Kill!\n\nThe axe swung back in his hand. He remembered the swift stroke, the\nhard resistance of the spine, the joy of having struck and won. I\nnever got to win. They always held me back. My hands wouldn't paint\nwhat I told them, my mind wouldn't reach where I wanted to go. When I\nloved Raven she didn't let me out, she denied me, she made me hold my\nfeelings back. But now I strike! Now I swing an unfettered arm.\n\nSordman knew what he was joined with now. Smith was what the psycher\nTalents called an unopened personality. A mind totally absorbed in\nwhat things meant to itself. A mind which had not learned to feel the\npain and joy of other minds.\n\nSmith's arm had stretched all the way back. He had to act now or\nsomeone else would die. He was Sordman the Protector, one of the four\nbest Talents in the world and his powers were running like a river at\nflood. All he had to do was make the right move.\n\nHe linked Smith's mind with the mind of the rifleman.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man in the blue morning coat was forty-three years old. He worked\nin New York City, the assistant manager of a transportation line's\nlocal office. His second wife had grown pregnant by accident, which\nunder law meant they were automatically married for life. They had\nbeen married for fifteen years and still didn't know each other. His\ntwo sons thought he was a spineless old fool who slept all the time\nand couldn't give them what they needed. He didn't like his job but he\nknew it was all he would ever do, an exact definition of his limits.\nAlone in his house, imprisoned by his work, he smoked and slept and ate\nwithout appetite.\n\nBut now he aimed his rifle and thought, I'll kill the witch. That will\nbe something. I'll know I did that.\n\nThe two minds were one. Each knew the other's pain, the other's fear.\nIf one died, the other felt his death.\n\nEach recognized the other man's hunger, his frustration, his\nimprisonment within his body and the limits of his life.\n\nSordman felt the weight of their lives. He gathered in the strength he\ncalled a gift. His voice and mind, his total self, sang the Liturgy of\nJoy. He gave his feelings and thoughts.\n\nThe axe dropped.\n\nThe finger squeezed the trigger and the bullet cut the bark from a tree.\n\nHis thoughts became a lullaby, a drowsy murmuring of peace and healing\nsleep.\n\nGeorge and Lee ran from the woods.\n\n\"Andy! Don't shoot them. Andy!\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n--Here.\n\nHe wiggled the leaves and branches of the brush.\n\n--Here!\n\nThey stood over the unconscious men. The hunters crept from their\nhiding spots and joined them.\n\n\"We'll bring him in,\" George said. \"A psycher team is on the way.\"\n\n--Good.\n\nLee said, \"You feel tired, Andy.\"\n\n--I think they get harder. They take more out of me. Lee?\n\n\"What, Andy?\"\n\n--It'll never end, will it?\n\nHe was a young man speaking to an older person. He had seen much of\nhumanity, but there were things only years could tell.\n\n\"Probably not. Is it too much?\"\n\n--No.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Sordman the Protector, by Tom Purdom\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SORDMAN THE PROTECTOR ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51445.txt or 51445.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/4/4/51445/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
