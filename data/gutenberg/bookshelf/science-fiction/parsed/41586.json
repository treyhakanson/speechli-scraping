The world, in a far distant future, is\n    peopled with huge insects and titanic fungus growths. Life has been\n    greatly altered, and tiny Man is now in the process of becoming\n    acclimated to the change. We again meet our hero Burl, but this time\n    a far greater danger menaces the human race. The huge insects are\n    still in evidence, but the terror they inspire is as nothing\n    compared to the deadly Red Dust. You will follow this remarkable\n    story with breathless interest._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nPrey\n\n\nThe sky grew gray and then almost white. The overhanging banks of clouds\nseemed to withdraw a little from the steaming earth. Haze that hung\nalways among the mushroom forests and above the fungus hills grew more\ntenuous, and the slow and misty rain that dripped the whole night long\nceased reluctantly.\n\nAs far as the eye could see a mad world stretched out, a world of\ninsensate cruelties and strange, fierce maternal solicitudes. The\ninsects of the night--the great moths whose wings spread far and wide in\nthe dimness, and the huge fireflies, four feet in length, whose beacons\nmade the earth glow in their pale, weird light--the insects of the night\nhad sought their hiding-places.\n\nNow the creatures of the day ventured forth. A great ant-hill towered a\nhundred feet in the air. Upon its gravel and boulder-strewn side a\ncommotion became visible.\n\nThe earth crumbled, and fell into an invisible opening, then a dark\nchasm appeared, and two slender, threadlike antenn\u00e6 peered out.\n\nA warrior ant emerged, and stood for an instant in the daylight, looking\nall about for signs of danger to the ant-city. He was all of ten inches\nlong, this ant, and his mandibles were fierce and strong. A second and\nthird warrior came from the inside of the ant-hill, and ran with tiny\nclickings about the hillock, waving their antenn\u00e6 restlessly, searching,\never searching for a menace to their city.\n\nThey returned to the gateway from which they had made their appearance,\nevidently bearing reassuring messages, because shortly after they had\nre\u00ebntered the gateway of the ant-city, a flood of black, ill-smelling\nworkers poured out of the opening and dispersed upon their business. The\nclickings of their limbs and an occasional whining stridulation made an\nincessant sound as they scattered over the earth, foraging among the\nmushrooms and giant cabbages, among the rubbish-heaps of the gigantic\nbee-hives and wasp colonies, and among the remains of the tragedies of\nthe night for food for their city.\n\nThe city of the ants had begun its daily toil, toil in which every one\nshared without supervision or coercion. Deep in the recesses of the\npyramid galleries were hollowed out and winding passages that led down a\nfathomless distance into the earth below.\n\nSomewhere in the maze of tunnels there was a royal apartment, in which\nthe queen-ant reposed, waited upon by assiduous courtiers, fed by royal\nstewards, and combed and rubbed by the hands of her subjects and\nchildren.\n\nBut even the huge monarch of the city had her constant and pressing duty\nof maternity. A dozen times the size of her largest loyal servant, she\nwas no less bound by the unwritten but imperative laws of the city than\nthey. From the time of waking to the time of rest, she was ordained to\nbe the queen-mother in the strictest and most literal sense of the word,\nfor at intervals to be measured only in terms of minutes she brought\nforth a single egg, perhaps three inches in length, which was instantly\nseized by one of her eager attendants and carried in haste to the\nmunicipal nursery.\n\nThere it was placed in a tiny cell a foot or more in length until a\nsac-shaped grub appeared, all soft, white body save for a tiny mouth.\nThen the nurses took it in charge and fed it with curious, tender\ngestures until it had waxed large and fat and slept the sleep of\nmetamorphosis. When it emerged from its rudimentary cocoon it took the\nplaces of its nurses until its soft skin had hardened into the horny\narmor of the workers and soldiers, and then it joined the throng of\nworkers that poured out from the city at dawn to forage for food, to\nbring back its finds and to share with the warriors and the nurses, the\ndrone males and the young queens, and all the other members of its\ncommunities, their duties in the city itself. That was the life of the\nsocial insect, absolute devotion to the cause of its city, utter\nabnegation of self-interest for the sake of its fellows--and death at\ntheir hands when their usefulness was past. They neither knew nor\nexpected more or less.\n\nIt is a strange instinct that prompts these creatures to devote their\nlives to their city, taking no smallest thought for their individual\ngood, without even the call of maternity or sex to guide them. Only the\nqueen knows motherhood. The others know nothing but toil, for purposes\nthey do not understand, and to an end of which they cannot dream. At\nintervals all over the world of Burl's time these ant-cities rose above\nthe surrounding ground, some small and barely begun, and others ancient\ncolonies which were truly the continuation of cities first built when\nthe ants were insects to be crushed beneath the feet of men. These\nancient strongholds towered two, three, and even four hundred feet above\nthe plains, and their inhabitants would have had to be numbered in\nmillions if not billions.\n\nNot all the earth was subject to the ants, however. Bees and wasps and\nmore deadly creatures crawled over and flew above its surface. The bees\nwere four feet and more in length. And slender-waisted wasps darted here\nand there, preying upon the colossal crickets that sang deep bass music\nto their mates--and the length of the crickets was the length of a man,\nand more.\n\nSpiders with bloated bellies waited, motionless, in their snares, whose\nthreads were the size of small cables, waiting for some luckless giant\ninsect to be entangled in the gummy traps. And butterflies fluttered\nover the festering plains of this new world, tremendous creatures whose\nwings could only be measured in terms of yards.\n\nAn outcropping of rock jutted up abruptly from a fungus-covered plain.\nShelf-fungi and strangely colored molds stained the stone until the\nshining quartz was hidden almost completely from view, but the whole\nglistened like tinted crystal from the dank wetness of the night. Little\nwisps of vapor curled away from the slopes as the moisture was taken up\nby the already moisture-laden air.\n\nSeen from a distance, the outcropping of rock looked innocent and still,\nbut a nearer view showed many things.\n\nHere a hunting wasp had come upon a gray worm, and was methodically\ninserting its sting into each of the twelve segments of the faintly\nwrithing creature. Presently the worm would be completely paralyzed, and\nwould be carried to the burrow of the wasp, where an egg would be laid\nupon it, from which a tiny maggot would presently hatch. Then weeks of\nagony for the great gray worm, conscious, but unable to move, while the\nmaggot fed upon its living flesh--\n\nThere the tiny spider, youngest of hatchlings, barely four inches\nacross, stealthily stalked some other still tinier mite, the little,\nmany-legged larva of the oil-beetle, known as the bee-louse. The almost\ninfinitely small bee-louse was barely two inches long, and could easily\nhide in the thick fur of a great bumblebee.\n\nThis one small creature would never fulfill its destiny, however. The\nhatchling spider sprang--it was a combat of midgets which was soon over.\nWhen the spider had grown and was feared as a huge, black-bellied\ntarantula, it would slay monster crickets with the same ease and the\nsame implacable ferocity.\n\nThe outcropping of rock looked still and innocent. There was one point\nwhere it overhung, forming a shelf, beneath which the stone fell away in\na sheer-drop. Many colored fungus growths covered the rock, making it a\nriot of tints and shades. But hanging from the rooflike projection of\nthe stone there was a strange, drab-white object. It was in the shape of\nhalf a globe, perhaps six feet by six feet at its largest. A number of\nlittle semicircular doors were fixed about its sides, like inverted\narches, each closed by a blank wall. One of them would open, but only\none.\n\nThe house was like the half of a pallid orange, fastened to the roof of\nrock. Thick cables stretched in every direction for yards upon yards,\nanchoring the habitation firmly, but the most striking of the things\nabout the house--still and quiet and innocent, like all the rest of the\nrock outcropping--were the ghastly trophies fastened to the outer walls\nand hanging from long silken chains below.\n\nHere was the hind leg of one of the smaller beetles. There was the\nwing-case of a flying creature. Here a snail-shell, two feet in\ndiameter, hanging at the end of an inch-thick cable. There a boulder\nthat must have weighed thirty or forty pounds, dangling in similar\nfashion.\n\nBut fastened here and there, haphazard and irregularly, were other more\nrepulsive remnants. The shrunken head-armor of a beetle, the fierce jaws\nof a cricket--the pitiful shreds of a hundred creatures that had formed\nforgotten meals for the bloated insect within the home.\n\nComparatively small as was the nest of the clotho spider, it was\ndecorated as no ogre's castle had ever been adorned--legs sucked dry of\ntheir contents, corselets of horny armor forever to be unused by any\ncreature, a wing of this insect, the head of that. And dangling by the\nlongest cord of all, with a silken cable wrapped carefully about it to\nkeep the parts together, was the shrunken, shriveled, dried-up body of a\nlong-dead man!\n\nOutside, the nest was a place of gruesome relics. Within, it was a place\nof luxury and ease. A cushion of softest down filled all the bulging\nbottom of the hemisphere. A canopy of similarly luxurious texture\ninterposed itself between the rocky roof and the dark, hideous body of\nthe resting spider.\n\nThe eyes of the hairy creature glittered like diamonds, even in the\ndarkness, but the loathsome, attenuated legs were tucked under the\nround-bellied body, and the spider was at rest. It had fed.\n\nIt waited, motionless, without desires or aversions, without emotions or\nperplexities, in comfortable, placid, machinelike contentment until time\nshould bring the call to feed again.\n\nA fresh carcass had been added to the decorations of the nest only the\nnight before. For many days the spider would repose in motionless\nsplendor within the silken castle. When hunger came again, a nocturnal\nforay, a creature would be pounced upon and slain, brought bodily to the\nnest, and feasted upon, its body festooned upon the exterior, and\nanother half-sleeping, half-waking period of dreamful idleness within\nthe sybaritic charnel-house would ensue.\n\nSlowly and timidly, half a dozen pink-skinned creatures made their way\nthrough the mushroom forest that led to the outcropping of rock under\nwhich the clotho spider's nest was slung. They were men, degraded\nremnants of the once dominant race.\n\nBurl was their leader, and was distinguished solely by two three-foot\nstumps of the feathery, golden antenn\u00e6 of a night-flying moth he had\nbound to his forehead. In his hand was a horny, chitinous spear, taken\nfrom the body of an unknown flying creature killed by the flames of the\nburning purple hills.\n\nSince Burl's return from his solitary--and involuntary--journey, he had\nbeen greatly revered by his tribe. Hitherto it had been but a\nleaderless, formless group of people, creeping to the same hiding-place\nat nightfall to share in the food of the fortunate, and shudder at the\nfate of those who might not appear.\n\nNow Burl had walked boldly to them, bearing, upon his back the gray bulk\nof a labyrinth spider he had slain with his own hands, and clad in\nwonderful garments of a gorgeousness they envied and admired. They hung\nupon his words as he struggled to tell them of his adventures, and\nslowly and dimly they began to look to him for leadership. He was\nwonderful. For days they had listened breathlessly to the tale of his\nadventures, but when he demanded that they follow him in another and\nmore perilous affair, they were appalled.\n\nA peculiar strength of will had come to Burl. He had seen and done\nthings that no man in the memory of his tribe had seen or done. He had\nstood by when the purple hills burned and formed a funeral pyre for the\nhorde of army ants, and for uncounted thousands of flying creatures. He\nhad caught a leaping tarantula upon the point of his spear, and had\nescaped from the web of a banded web-spider by oiling his body so that\nthe sticky threads of the snare refused to hold him fast. He had\nattacked and killed a great gray labyrinth spider.\n\nBut most potent of all, he had returned and had been welcomed by\nSaya--Saya of the swift feet and slender limbs, whose smile roused\nstrange emotions in Burl's breast.\n\nIt was the adoring gaze of Saya that had roused Burl to this last pitch\nof rashness. Months before the clotho spider in the hemispherical silk\ncastle of the gruesome decorations had killed and eaten one of the men\nof the tribe. Burl and the spider's victim had been together when the\nspider appeared, and the first faint gray light of morning barely\nsilhouetted the shaggy, horrible creature as it leaped from ambush\nbehind a toadstool toward the fear-stricken pair.\n\nIts attenuated legs were outstretched, its mandibles gaped wide, and its\njaws clashed horribly as it formed a black blotch in mid air against the\nlightening sky.\n\nBurl had fled, screaming, when the other man was seized. Now, however,\nhe was leading half a dozen trembling men toward the inverted dome in\nwhich the spider dozed. Two or three of them bore spears like Burl\nhimself, but they bore them awkwardly and timorously. Burl himself was\npossessed by a strange, fictitious courage. It was the utter\nrecklessness of youth, coupled with the eternal masculine desire to\ndisplay prowess before a desired female.\n\nThe wavering advance came to a halt. Most of the naked men stopped from\nfear, but Burl stopped to invoke his newly discovered inner self, that\nhad furnished him with such marvelous plans. Quite accidentally he had\nfound that if he persistently asked himself a question, some sort of\nanswer came from within.\n\nNow he gazed up from a safe distance and asked himself how he and the\nothers were to slay the clotho spider. The nest was some forty feet from\nthe ground, on the undersurface of a shelf of rock. There was sheer open\nspace beneath it, but it was firmly held to its support by long, silken\ncables that curled to the upper side of the rock-shelf, clinging to the\nstone.\n\nBurl gazed, and presently an idea came to him. He beckoned to the others\nto follow him, and they did so, their knees knocking together from their\nfright. At the slightest alarm they would flee, screaming in fear, but\nBurl did not plan that there should be any alarm.\n\nHe led them to the rear of the singular rock formation, up the gently\nsloping side, and toward the precipitous edge. He drew near the point\nwhere the rock fell away. A long, tentacle-like silk cable curled up\nover the edge of a little promontory of stone that jutted out into\nnothingness.\n\nBurl began to feel oddly cold, and something of the panic of the other\nmen communicated itself to him. This was one of the anchoring cables\nthat held the spider's castle secure. He looked and found others, six or\nseven in all, which performed the task of keeping the shaggy, horrid\nogre's home from falling to the ground below.\n\nHis idea did not desert him, however, and he drew back, to whisper\norders to his followers. They obeyed him solely because they were\nafraid, and he spoke in an authoritative tone, but they did obey, and\nbrought a dozen heavy boulders of perhaps forty pounds weight each.\n\nBurl grasped one of the silken cables at its end and tore it loose from\nthe rock for a space of perhaps two yards. His flesh crawled as he did\nso, but something within him drove him on. Then, while beads of\nperspiration stood out on his forehead--induced by nothing less than\ncold, physical fear--he tied the boulder to the cable. The first one\ndone, he felt emboldened, and made a second fast, and a third.\n\nOne of his men stood near the edge of the rock, listening in agonized\napprehension. Burl had soon tied a heavy stone to each of the cables he\nsaw, and as a matter of fact, there was but one of them he failed to\nnotice. That one had been covered by the flaking mold that took the\nplace of grass upon the rocky eminence.\n\nThere were left upon the promontory, several of the boulders for which\nthere was no use, but Burl did not attempt to double the weights on the\ncables. He took his followers aside and explained his plan in whispers.\nQuaking, they agreed, and, trembling, they prepared to carry it out.\n\nOne of them stationed himself beside each of the boulders, Burl at the\nlargest. He gave a signal, and half a dozen ripping, tearing sounds\nbroke the sullen silence of the day. The boulders clashed and clattered\ndown the rocky side of the precipice, tearing--perhaps \"peeling\"--the\ncables from their adhesion to the stone. They shot into open space and\njerked violently at the half-globular nest, which was wrenched from its\nplace by the combined impetus of the six heavy weights.\n\nBurl had flung himself upon his face to watch what he was sure would be\nthe death of the spider as it fell forty feet and more, imprisoned in\nits heavily weighted home. His eyes sparkled with triumph as he saw the\nghastly, trophy-laden house swing out from the cliff. Then he gasped in\nterror.\n\nOne of the cables had not been discovered. That single cable held the\nspider's castle from a fall, though the nest had been torn from its\nanchorage, and now dangled heavily on its side in mid air. A convulsive\nstruggle seemed to be going on within.\n\nThen one of the archlike doors opened, and the spider emerged, evidently\nin terror, and confused by the light of day, but still venomous and\nstill deadly. It found but a single of its anchoring cables intact, that\nleading to the cliff top hard by Burl's head.\n\nThe spider sprang for this single cable, and its legs grasped the\nslender thread eagerly while it began to climb rapidly up toward the\ncliff top.\n\nAs with all the creatures of Burl's time, its first thought was of\nbattle, not flight, and it came up the thin cord with its poison fangs\nunsheathed and its mandibles clashing in rage. The shaggy hair upon its\nbody seemed to bristle with insane ferocity, and the horrible, thin legs\nmoved with desperate haste as it hastened to meet and wreak vengeance\nupon the cause of its sudden alarm.\n\nBurl's followers fled, uttering shrieks of fear, and Burl started to his\nfeet, in the grip of a terrible panic. Then his hand struck one of the\nheavy boulders. Exerting every ounce of his strength, he pushed it over\nthe cliff just where the cable appeared above the edge. For the fraction\nof a second there was silence, and then the indescribable sound of an\nimpact against a soft body.\n\nThere was a gasping cry, and a moment later the curiously muffled\nclatter of the boulder striking the earth below. Somehow, the sound\nsuggested that the boulder had struck first upon some soft object.\n\nA faint cry came from the bottom of the hill. The last of Burl's men was\nleaping to a hiding-place among the mushrooms of the forest, and had\nseen the sheen of shining armor just before him. He cried out and waited\nfor death, but only a delicately formed wasp rose heavily into the air,\nbearing beneath it the more and more feebly struggling body of a giant\ncricket.\n\nBurl had stood paralyzed, deprived of the power of movement, after\ncasting the boulder over the cliff. That one action had taken the last\nounce of his initiative, and if the spider had hauled itself over the\nrocky edge and darted toward him, slavering its thick spittle and\nuttering sounds of mad fury, Burl would not even have screamed as it\nseized him. He was like a dead thing. But the oddly muffled sound of the\nboulder striking the ground below brought back hope of life and power of\nmovement.\n\nHe peered over the cliff. The nest still dangled at the end of the\nsingle cable, still freighted with its gruesome trophies, but on the\nground below a crushed and horribly writhing form was moving in\nconvulsions of rage and agony.\n\nLong, hairy legs worked desperately from a body that was no more than a\nmass of pulped flesh. A ferocious jaw tried to clamp upon something--and\nthere was no other jaw to meet it. An evil-smelling, sticky liquid\nexuded from the mangled writhing, thing upon the earth, moving in\nterrible contortions of torment.\n\nPresently an ant drew near and extended inquisitive antenn\u00e6 at the\nhelpless monster wounded to death. A shrill stridulation sounded out,\nand three or four other foot-long ants hastened up to wait patiently\njust outside the spider's reach until its struggles should have lessened\nenough to make possible the salvage of flesh from the perhaps\nstill-living creature for the ant city a mile away.\n\nAnd Burl, up on the cliff-top, danced and gesticulated in triumph. He\nhad killed the clotho spider, which had slain one of the tribesmen four\nmonths before. Glory was his. All the tribesmen had seen the spider\nliving. Now he would show them the spider dead. He stopped his dance of\ntriumph and walked down the hill in haughty grandeur. He would reproach\nhis timid followers for fleeing from the spider, leaving him to kill it\nalone.\n\nQuite na\u00efvely Burl assumed that it was his place to give orders and that\nof the others to obey. True, no one had attempted to give orders before,\nor to enforce their execution, but Burl had reached the eminently\nwholesome conclusion that he was a wonderful person whose wishes should\nbe respected.\n\nBurl, filled with fresh notions of his own importance, strutted on\ntoward the hiding-place of the tribe, growing more and more angry with\nthe other men for having deserted him. He would reproach them, would\nprobably beat them. They would be afraid to protest, and in the future\nwould undoubtedly be afraid to run away.\n\nBurl was quite convinced that running away was something he could not\ntolerate in his followers. Obscurely--and conveniently in the extreme\nback of his mind--he reasoned that not only did a larger number of men\npresent at a scene of peril increase the chances of coping with the\ndanger, but they also increased the chances that the victim selected by\nthe dangerous creature would be another than himself.\n\nBurl's reasoning was unsophisticated, but sound; perhaps unconscious,\nbut none the less effective. He grew quite furious with the deserters.\nThey had run away! They had fled from a mere spider.\n\nA shrill whine filled the air, and a ten-inch ant dashed at Burl with\nits mandibles extended threateningly. Burl's path had promised to\ninterrupt the salvaging work of the insect, engaged in scraping shreds\nof flesh from the corselet of one of the smaller beetles slain the\nprevious night. The ant dashed at Burl like an infuriated fox-terrier,\nand Burl scurried away in undignified retreat. The ant might not be\ndangerous, but bites from its formic acid-poisoned mandibles were no\ntrifles.\n\nBurl came to the tangled thicket of mushrooms in which his tribefolk\nhid. The entrance was tortuous and difficult to penetrate, and could be\nblocked on occasion with stones and toadstool pulp. Burl made his way\ntoward the central clearing, and heard as he went the sound of weeping,\nand the excited chatter of the tribes people.\n\nThose who had fled from the rocky cliff had returned with the news that\nBurl was dead, and Saya lay weeping beneath an over-shadowing toadstool.\nShe was not yet the mate of Burl, but the time would come when all the\ntribe would recognize a status dimly different from the usual tribal\nrelationship.\n\nBurl stepped into the clearing, and straightway cuffed the first man he\ncame upon, then the next and the next. There was a cry of astonishment,\nand the next second instinctive, fearful glances at that entrance to the\nhiding-place.\n\nHad Burl fled from the spider, and was it following? Burl spoke loftily,\nsaying that the spider was dead, that its legs, each one the length of a\nman, were still, and its fierce jaws and deadly poison-fangs harmless\nforevermore.\n\nTen minutes later he was leading an incredulous, awed little group of\npink-skinned people to the spot below the cliff where the spider\nactually lay dead, with the ants busily at work upon its remains.\n\nAnd when he went back to the hiding-place he donned again his great\ncloak that was made from the wing of a magnificent moth, slain by the\nflames of the purple hills, and sat down in splendor upon a crumbling\ntoadstool, to feast upon the glances of admiration and awe that were\nsent toward him. Only Saya held back shyly, until he motioned for her to\ndraw near, when she seated herself at his feet and gazed up at him with\nunutterable adoration in her eyes.\n\nBut while Burl basked in the radiance of his tribe's admiration, danger\nwas drawing near them all. For many months there had been strange red\nmushrooms growing slowly here and there all over the earth, they knew.\nThe tribefolk had speculated about them, but forebore tasting them\nbecause they were strange, and strange things were usually dangerous and\noften fatal.\n\nNow those red growths had ripened and grown ready to emit their spores.\nTheir rounded tops had grown fat, and the tough skin grew taut as if a\nstrange pressure were being applied from within. And to-day, while Burl\nluxuriated in his position of feared and admired great man of his tribe,\nat a spot a long distance away, upon a hill-top, one of the red\nmushrooms burst. The spores inside the taut, tough skin shot all about\nas if scattered by an explosion, and made a little cloud of reddish,\nimpalpable dust, which hung in the air and moved slowly with the\nsluggish breeze.\n\nA bee droned into the thin red cloud of dust, lazily and heavily flying\nback toward the hive. But barely had she entered the tinted atmosphere\nwhen her movements became awkward and convulsive, effortful and excited.\nShe trembled and twisted in mid air in a peculiar fashion, then dropped\nto the earth, while her abdomen moved violently.\n\nBees, like almost all insects, breathe through spiracles on the\nundersurfaces of their abdomens. This bee had breathed in some of the\nred mushroom's spores. She thrashed about desperately upon the\ntoadstools on which she had fallen, struggling for breath, for life.\n\nAfter a long time she was still. The cloud of red mushroom spores had\nstrangled or poisoned her. And everywhere the red fringe grew, such\nexplosions were taking place, one by one, and wherever the red clouds\nhung in the air creatures were breathing them in and dying in\nconvulsions of strangulation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe Journey\n\n\nDarkness. The soft, blanketing night of the age of fungoids had fallen\nover all the earth, and there was blackness everywhere that was not good\nto have. Here and there, however, dim, bluish lights glowed near the\nground. There an intermittent glow showed that a firefly had wandered\nfar from the rivers and swamps above which most of his kind now\ncongregated. Now a faintly luminous ball of fire drifted above the\nsteaming, moisture-sodden earth. It was a will-o'-the-wisp, grown to a\nyard in diameter.\n\nFrom the low-hanging banks of clouds that hung perpetually overhead,\nlarge, warm raindrops fell ceaselessly. A drop, a pause, and then\nanother drop, added to the already dank moisture of the ground below.\n\nThe world of fungus growths flourished on just such dampness and\nhumidity. It seemed as if the toadstools and mushrooms could be heard,\nswelling and growing large in the darkness. Rustlings and stealthy\nmovements sounded furtively through the night, and from above the heavy\nthrob of mighty wing-beats was continuous.\n\nThe tribe was hidden in the midst of a tangled copse of toadstools too\nthickly interwoven for the larger insects to penetrate. Only the little\nmidgets hid in its recesses during the night-time, and the smaller moths\nduring the day.\n\nAbout and among the bases of the toadstools, however, where their spongy\nstalks rose from the humid earth, small beetles roamed, singing\ncheerfully to themselves in deep bass notes. They were small and round,\nsome six or eight inches long, and their bellies were pale gray.\n\nAnd as they went about they emitted sounds which would have been chirps\nhad they been other than low as the lowest tone of a harp. They were\ntruffle-beetles, in search of the dainty tidbits on which epicures once\nhad feasted.\n\nSome strange sense seemed to tell them when one of half a dozen\nvarieties of truffle was beneath them, and they paused in their\nwandering to dig a tunnel straight down. A foot, two feet, or two yards,\nall was the same to them. In time they would come upon the morsel they\nsought and would remain at the bottom of their temporary home until it\nwas consumed. Then another period of wandering, singing their cheerful\nsong, until another likely spot was reached and another tunnel begun.\n\nIn a tiny, open space in the center of the toadstool thicket the\ntribefolk slept with the deep notes of the truffle-beetles in their\nears. A new danger had come to them, but they had passed it on to Burl\nwith a new and childlike confidence and considered the matter settled.\nThey slept, while beneath a glowing mushroom at one side of the clearing\nBurl struggled with his new problem. He squatted upon the ground in the\ndim radiance of the shining toadstool, his moth-wing cloak wrapped about\nhim, his spear in his hand, and his twin golden plumes of the moth's\nantenn\u00e6 bound to his forehead. But his face was downcast as a child's.\n\nThe red mushrooms had begun to burst. Only that day, one of the women,\nseeking edible fungus for the tribal larder, had seen the fat, distended\nglobule of the red mushroom. Its skin was stretched taut, and glistened\nin the light.\n\nThe woman paid little or no attention to the red growth. Her ears were\nattuned to catch sounds that would warn her of danger while her eyes\nsearched for tidbits that would make a meal for the tribe, and more\nparticularly for her small son, left behind at the hiding-place.\n\nA ripping noise made her start up, alert on the instant. The red\nenvelope of the mushroom had split across the top, and a thick cloud of\nbrownish-red dust was spurting in every direction. It formed a pyramidal\ncloud some thirty feet in height, which enlarged and grew thinner with\nminor eddies within itself.\n\nA little yellow butterfly with wings barely a yard from tip to tip,\nflapped lazily above the mushroom-covered plain. Its wings beat the air\nwith strokes that seemed like playful taps upon a friendly element. The\nbutterfly was literally intoxicated with the sheer joy of living. It had\nemerged from its cocoon barely two hours before, and was making its\nmaiden flight above the strange and wonderful world. It fluttered\ncarelessly into the red-brown cloud of mushroom spores.\n\nThe woman was watching the slowly changing form of the spore-mist. She\nsaw the butterfly enter the brownish dust, and then her eyes became\ngreedy. There was something the matter with the butterfly. Its wings no\nlonger moved lazily and gently. They struck out in frenzied, hysterical\nblows that were erratic and wild. The little yellow creature no longer\nfloated lightly and easily, but dashed here and there, wildly and\nwithout purpose, seeming to be in its death-throes.\n\nIt crashed helplessly against the ground and lay there, moving feebly.\nThe woman hurried forward. The wings would be new fabric with which to\nadorn herself, and the fragile legs of the butterfly contained choice\nmeat. She entered the dust-cloud.\n\nA stream of intolerable fire--though the woman had never seen or known\nof fire--burned her nostrils and seared her lungs. She gasped in pain,\nand the agony was redoubled. Her eyes smarted as if burning from their\nsockets, and tears blinded her.\n\nThe woman instinctively turned about to flee, but before she had gone a\ndozen yards--blinded as she was--she stumbled and fell to the ground.\nShe lay there, gasping, and uttering moans of pain, until one of the men\nof the tribe who had been engaged in foraging near by saw her and tried\nto find what had injured her.\n\nShe could not speak, and he was about to leave her and tell the other\ntribefolk about her when he heard the clicking of an ant's limbs, and\nrather than have the ant pick her to pieces bit by bit--and leave his\ncuriosity ungratified--the man put her across his shoulders and bore her\nback to the hiding-place of the tribe.\n\nIt was the tale the woman had told when she partly recovered that caused\nBurl to sit alone all that night beneath the shining toadstool in the\nlittle clearing, puzzling his just-awakened brain to know what to do.\n\nThe year before there had been no red mushrooms. They had appeared only\nrecently, but Burl dimly remembered that one day, a long time before,\nthere had been a strange breeze which blew for three day and nights, and\nthat during the time of its blowing all the tribe had been sick and had\nwept continually.\n\nBurl had not yet reached the point of mental development when he would\nassociate that breeze with a storm at a distance, or reason that the\nspores of the red mushrooms had been borne upon the wind to the present\nresting-places of the deadly fungus growths. Still less could he decide\nthat the breeze had not been deadly only because it was lightly laden\nwith the fatal dust.\n\nHe knew simply that unknown red mushrooms had appeared, that they were\neverywhere about, and that they would burst, and that to breathe the\nred dust they gave out was grievous sickness or death.\n\nThe tribe slept while the bravely attired figure of Burl squatted under\nthe glowing disk of the luminous mushroom, his face a picture of\nquerulous perplexity, and his heart full of sadness.\n\nHe had consulted his strange inner self, and no plan had come to him. He\nknew the red mushrooms were all about. They would fill the air with\ntheir poison. He struggled with his problem while his people slumbered,\nand the woman who had breathed the mushroom-dust sobbed softly in her\ntroubled sleep.\n\nPresently a figure stirred on the farther side of the clearing. Saya\nwoke and raised her head. She saw Burl crouching by the shining\ntoadstool, his gay attire draggled and unnoticed. She watched him for a\nlittle, and the desolation of his pose awoke her pity.\n\nShe rose and went to his side, taking his hand between her two, while\nshe spoke his name softly. When he turned and looked at her, confusion\nsmote her, but the misery in his face brought confidence again.\n\nBurl's sorrow was inarticulate--he could not explain this new\nresponsibility for his people that had come to him--but he was comforted\nby her presence, and she sat down beside him. After a long time she\nslept, with her head resting against his side, but he continued to\nquestion himself, continued to demand an escape for his people from the\nsuffering and danger he saw ahead. With the day an answer came.\n\nWhen Burl had been carried down the river on his fungus raft, and had\nlanded in the country of the army ants, he had seen great forests of\nedible mushrooms, and had said to himself that he would bring Saya to\nthat place. He remembered, now, that the red mushrooms were there also,\nbut the idea of a journey remained.\n\nThe hunting-ground of his tribe had been free of the red fungoids until\nrecently. If he traveled far enough he would come to a place where there\nwere still no red toadstools. Then came the decision. He would lead his\ntribe to a far country.\n\nHe spoke with stern authority when the tribesmen woke, talking in few\nwords and in a loud voice, holding up his spear as he gave his orders.\n\nThe timid, pink-skinned people obeyed him meekly. They had seen the body\nof the clotho spider he had slain, and he had thrown down before them\nthe gray bulk of the labyrinth spider he had thrust through with his\nspear. Now he was to take them through unknown dangers to an unknown\nhaven, but they feared to displease him.\n\nThey made light loads of their mushrooms and such meat-stuffs as they\nhad, and parceled out what little fabric they still possessed. Three men\nbore spears, in addition to Burl's long shaft, and he had persuaded the\nother three to carry clubs, showing them how the weapon should be\nwielded.\n\nThe indefinitely brighter spot in the cloud-banks above that meant the\nshining sun had barely gone a quarter of the way across the sky when the\ntrembling band of timid creatures made their way from their hiding-place\nand set out upon their journey. For their course, Burl depended entirely\nupon chance. He avoided the direction of the river, however, and the\npath along which he had returned to his people. He knew the red\nmushrooms grew there. Purely by accident he set his march toward the\nwest, and walked cautiously on, his tribesfolk following him fearfully.\n\nBurl walked ahead, his spear held ready. He made a figure at once brave\nand pathetic, venturing forth in a world of monstrous ferocity and\nincredible malignance, armed only with a horny spear borrowed from a\ndead insect. His velvety cloak, made from a moth's wing, hung about his\nfigure in graceful folds, however, and twin golden plumes nodded\njauntily from his forehead.\n\nBehind him the nearly naked people followed reluctantly. Here a woman\nwith a baby in her arms, there children of nine or ten, unable to resist\nthe Instinct to play even in the presence of the manifold dangers of the\nmarch. They ate hungrily of the lumps of mushroom they had been ordered\nto carry. Then a long-legged boy, his eyes roving anxiously about in\nsearch of danger followed.\n\nThirty thousand years of flight from every peril had deeply submerged\nthe combative nature of humanity. After the boy came two men, one with a\nshort spear, and the other with a club, each with a huge mass of edible\nmushroom under his free arm, and both badly frightened at the idea of\nfleeing from dangers they knew and feared to dangers they did not know\nand consequently feared much more.\n\nSo was the caravan spread out. It made its way across the country with\nmany deviations from a fixed line, and with many halts and pauses. Once\na shrill stridulation filled all the air before them, a monster sound\ncompounded of innumerable clickings and high-pitched cries.\n\nThey came to the tip of an eminence and saw a great space of ground\ncovered with tiny black bodies locked in combat. For quite half a mile\nin either direction the earth was black with ants, snapping and biting\nat each other, locked in vise-like embraces, each combatant couple\ntrampled under the feet of the contending armies, with no thought of\nsurrender or quarter.\n\nThe sound of the clashing of fierce jaws upon horny armor, the cries of\nthe maimed, and strange sounds made by the dying, and above all, the\nwhining battle-cry of each of the fighting hordes, made a sustained\nuproar that was almost deafening.\n\nFrom either side of the battle-ground a pathway led back to separate\nant-cities, a pathway marked by the hurrying groups of reinforcements\nrushing to the fight. Tiny as the ants were, for once no lumbering\nbeetle swaggered insolently in their path, nor did the hunting-spiders\nmark them out for prey. Only little creatures smaller than the\ncombatants themselves made use of the insect war for purposes of their\nown.\n\nThese were little gray ants barely more than four inches long, who\nscurried about in and among the fighting creatures with marvelous\ndexterity, carrying off, piece-meal, the bodies of the dead, and slaying\nthe wounded for the same fate.\n\nThey hung about the edges of the battle, and invaded the abandoned areas\nwhen the tide of battle shifted, insect guerrillas, fighting for their\nown hands, careless of the origin of the quarrel, espousing no cause,\nsimply salvaging the dead and living d\u00e9bris of the combat.\n\nBurl and his little group of followers had to make a wide detour to\navoid the battle itself, and the passage between bodies of\nreinforcements hurrying to the scene of strife was a matter of some\ndifficulty. The ants running rapidly toward the battle-field were hugely\nexcited. Their antenn\u00e6 waved wildly, and the infrequent wounded one,\nlimping back toward the city, was instantly and repeatedly challenged by\nthe advancing insects.\n\nThey crossed their antenn\u00e6 upon his, and required thorough evidence that\nhe was of the proper city before allowing him to proceed. Once they\narrived at the battle-field they flung themselves into the fray,\nbecoming lost and indistinguishable in the tide of straining, fighting\nblack bodies.\n\nMen in such a battle, without distinguishing marks or battle-cries,\nwould have fought among themselves as often as against their foes, but\nthe ants had a much simpler method of identification. Each ant-city\npossesses its individual odor--a variant on the scent of formic\nacid--and each individual of that city is recognized in his world quite\nsimply and surely by the way he smells.\n\nThe little tribe of human beings passed precariously behind a group of a\nhundred excited insect warriors, and before the following group of forty\nequally excited black insects. Burl hurried on with his following,\nputting many miles of perilous territory behind before nightfall. Many\ntimes during the day they saw the sudden billowing of a red-brown\ndust-cloud from the earth, and more than once they came upon the empty\nskin and drooping stalk of one of the red mushrooms, and more often\nstill they came upon the mushrooms themselves, grown fat and taut,\nprepared to send their deadly spores into the air when the pressure from\nwithin became more than the leathery skin could stand.\n\nThat night the tribe hid among the bases of giant puff-balls, which at a\ntouch shot out a puff of white powder resembling smoke. The powder was\nprecisely the same in nature as that cast out by the red mushrooms, but\nits effects were marvelously--and mercifully--different; it was\ninnocuous.\n\nBurl slept soundly this night, having been two days and a night without\nrest, but the remainder of his tribe, and even Saya, were fearful and\nafraid, listening ceaselessly all through the dark hours for the\nmenacing sounds of creatures coming to prey upon them.\n\nAnd so for a week the march kept on. Burl would not allow his tribe to\nstop to forage for food. The red mushrooms were all about. Once one of\nthe little children was caught in a whirling eddy of red dust, and its\nmother rushed into the deadly stuff to seize it and bring it out. Then\nthe tribe had to hide for three days while the two of them recovered\nfrom the debilitating poison.\n\nOnce, too, they found a half-acre patch of the giant cabbages--there\nwere six of them full grown, and a dozen or more smaller ones--and Burl\ntook two men and speared two of the huge, twelve-foot slugs that fed\nupon the leaves. When the tribe passed on it was gorged on the fat meat\nof the slugs, and there was much soft fur, so that all the tribefolk\nwore loin-cloths of the yellow stuff.\n\nThere were perils, too, in the journey. On the fourth day of the tribe's\ntraveling, Burl froze suddenly into stillness. One of the hairy\ntarantulas--a trap-door spider with a black belly--had fallen upon a\nscarab\u00e6us beetle, and was devouring it only a hundred yards ahead.\n\nThe tribefolk, trembling, went back for half a mile or more in\npanic-stricken silence, and refused to advance until he had led them a\ndetour of two or three miles to one side of the dangerous spot.\n\nLong, fear-ridden marches through perilous countries unknown to them,\nthrough the golden aisles of yellow mushroom forests, over the flaking\nsurfaces of plains covered with many-colored \"rusts\" and molds; pauses\nbeside turbid pools whose waters were concealed by thick layers of green\nslime, and other evil-smelling ponds which foamed and bubbled slowly,\nwhich were covered with pasty yeasts that rose in strange forms of\ndiscolored foam.\n\nFleeting glimpses they had of the glistening spokes of symmetrical\nspiders'-webs, whose least thread it would have been beyond the power of\nthe strongest of the tribe to break. They passed through a forest of\npuff-balls, which boomed when touched and shot a puff of vapor from\ntheir open mouths.\n\nOnce they saw a long and sinuous insect that fled before them and\ndisappeared into a burrow in the ground, running with incredible speed\nupon legs of uncountable number. It was a centipede all of thirty feet\nin length, and when they crossed the path it had followed a horrible\nstench came to their nostrils so that they hurried on.\n\nLong escape from unguessed dangers brought boldness, of a sort, to the\npink-skinned men, and they would have rested. They went to Burl with\ntheir complaint, and he simply pointed with his hands behind them. There\nwere three little clouds of brownish vapor in the air, where they could\nsee, along the road they had traversed. To the right of them a\ndust-cloud was just settling, and to the left another rose as they\nlooked.\n\nA new trick of the deadly dust became apparent now. Toward the end of a\nday in which they had traveled a long distance, one of the little\nchildren ran a little to the left of the route its elders were\nfollowing. The earth had taken on a brownish hue, and the child stirred\nup the surface mould with its feet.\n\nThe brownish dust that had settled there was raised again, and the child\nran, crying and choking, to its mother, its lungs burning as with fire,\nand its eyes like hot coals. Another day would pass before the child\ncould walk.\n\nIn a strange country, knowing nothing of the dangers that might assail\nthe tribe while waiting for the child to recover, Burl looked about for\na hiding-place. Far over to the right a low cliff, perhaps twenty or\nthirty feet high, showed sides of crumbling, yellow clay, and from where\nBurl stood he could see the dark openings of burrows scattered here and\nthere upon its face.\n\nHe watched for a time, to see if any bee or wasp inhabited them, knowing\nthat many kinds of both insects dig burrows for their young, and do not\noccupy them themselves. No dark forms appeared, however, and he led his\npeople toward the openings.\n\nThe appearance of the holes confirmed his surmise. They had been dug\nmonths before by mining bees, and the entrances were \"weathered\" and\nworn. The tribefolk made their way into the three-foot tunnels, and hid\nthemselves, seizing the opportunity to gorge themselves upon the food\nthey carried.\n\nBurl stationed himself near the outer end of one of the little caves to\nwatch for signs of danger. While waiting he poked curiously with his\nspear at a little pile of white and sticky parchment-like stuff he saw\njust within the mouth of the tunnel.\n\nInstantly movement became visible. Fifty, sixty, or a hundred tiny\ncreatures, no more than half an inch in length, tumbled pell-mell from\nthe dirty-white heap. Awkward legs, tiny, greenish-black bodies, and\nbristles protruding in every direction made them strange to look upon.\n\nThey had tumbled from the whitish heap and now they made haste to hide\nthemselves in it again, moving slowly and clumsily, with immense effort\nand laborious contortions of their bodies.\n\nBurl had never seen any insect progress in such a slow and ineffective\nfashion before. He drew one little insect back with the point of his\nspear and examined it from a safe distance. Tiny jaws before the head\nmet like twin sickles, and the whole body was shaped like a rounded\ndiamond lozenge.\n\nBurl knew that no insect of such small size could be dangerous, and\nleaned over, then took one creature in his hand. It wriggled frantically\nand slipped from his fingers, dropping upon the soft yellow\ncaterpillar-fur he had about his middle. Instantly, as if it were a\nconjuring trick, the little insect vanished, and Burl searched for a\nmatter of minutes before he found it hidden deep in the long, soft hairs\nof the fur, resting motionless, and evidently at ease.\n\nIt was a bee-louse, the first larval form of a beetle whose horny armor\ncould be seen in fragments for yards before the clayey cliff-side.\nHidden in the openings of the bee's tunnel, it waited until the\nbee-grubs farther back in their separate cells should complete their\nchanges of form and emerge into the open air, passing over the cluster\nof tiny creatures at the doorway. As the bees pass, the little bee-lice\nwould clamber in eager haste up their hairy legs and come to rest in the\nfur about their thoraxes. Then, weeks later, when the bees in turn made\nother cells and stocked them with honey for the eggs they would lay, the\ntiny creatures would slip from their resting-places and be left behind\nin the fully provisioned cell, to eat not only the honey the bee had so\nlaboriously acquired, but the very grub hatched from the bee's egg.\n\nBurl had no difficulty in detaching the small insect and casting it\naway, but in doing so discovered three more that had hidden themselves\nin his furry garment, no doubt thinking it the coat of their natural,\nthough unwilling hosts. He plucked them away, and discovered more, and\nmore. His garment was the hiding-place for dozens of the creatures.\n\nDisgusted and annoyed, he went out of the cavern and to a spot some\ndistance away, where he took off his robe and pounded it with the flat\nside of his spear to dislodge the visitors. They dropped out one by\none, reluctantly, and finally the garment was clean of them. Then Burl\nheard a shout from the direction of the mining-bee caves, and hastened\ntoward the sound.\n\nIt was then drawing toward the time of darkness, but one of the\ntribesmen had ventured out and found no less than three of the great\nimperial mushrooms. Of the three, one had been attacked by a parasitic\npurple mould, but the gorgeous yellow of the other two was undimmed, and\nthe people were soon feasting upon the firm flesh.\n\nBurl felt a little pang of jealousy, though he joined in the consumption\nof the find as readily as the others, and presently drew a little to one\nside.\n\nHe cast his eyes across the country, level and unbroken as far as the\neye could see. The small clay cliff was the only inequality visible, and\nits height cut off all vision on one side. But the view toward the\nhorizon was unobstructed on three sides, and here and there the black\nspeck of a monster bee could be seen, droning homeward to its hive or\nburrow, and sometimes the slender form of a wasp passed overhead, its\ntransparent wings invisible from the rapidity of their vibrations.\n\nThese flew high in the air, but lower down, barely skimming the tops of\nthe many-colored mushrooms and toadstools, fluttering lightly above the\nswollen fungoids, and touching their dainty proboscides to unspeakable\nthings in default of the fragrant flowers that were normal food for\ntheir races--lower down flew the multitudes of butterflies the age of\nmushrooms had produced.\n\nWhite and yellow and red and brown, pink and blue and purple and green,\nevery shade and every color, every size and almost every shape, they\nflitted gaily in the air. There were some so tiny that they would barely\nhave shaded Burl's face, and some beneath whose slender bodies he could\nhave hidden himself. They flew in a riot of colors and tints above a\nworld of foul mushroom growths, and turgid, slime-covered ponds.\n\nBurl, temporarily out of the limelight because of the discovery of a\nstore of food by another member of the tribe, bethought himself of an\nidea. Soon night would come on, the cloud-bank would turn red in the\nwest, and then darkness would lean downward from the sky. With the\ncoming of that time these creatures of the day would seek hiding-places,\nand the air would be given over to the furry moths that flew by night.\nHe, Burl, would mark the spot where one of the larger creatures\nalighted, and would creep up upon it, with his spear held fast.\n\nHis wide blue eyes brightened at the thought, and he sat himself down to\nwatch. After a long time the soft, down-reaching fingers of the night\ntouched the shaded aisles of the mushroom forests, and a gentle haze\narose above the golden glades. One by one the gorgeous fliers of the\ndaytime dipped down and furled their painted wings. The overhanging\nclouds became darker--finally black, and the slow, deliberate rainfall\nthat lasted all through the night began. Burl rose and crept away into\nthe darkness, his spear held in readiness.\n\nThrough the black night, beneath deeper blacknesses which were the dark\nundersides of huge toadstools, creeping silently, with every sense\nalert for sign of danger or for hope of giant prey, Burl made his slow\nadvance.\n\nA glorious butterfly of purple and yellow markings, whose wings spread\nout for three yards on either side of its delicately formed body, had\nhidden itself barely two hundred yards away. Burl could imagine it, now,\npreening its slender limbs and combing from its long and slender\nproboscis any trace of the delectable foodstuffs on which it had fed\nduring the day. Burl moved slowly and cautiously forward, all eyes and\nears.\n\nHe heard an indescribable sound in a thicket a little to his left, and\nshifted his course. The sound was the faint whistling of air through the\nbreathing-holes along an insect's abdomen. Then came the delicate\nrustling of filmy wings being stretched and closed again, and the\nmovement of sharply barbed feet upon the soft earth. Burl moved in\nbreathless silence, holding his spear before him in readiness to plunge\nit into the gigantic butterfly's soft body.\n\nThe mushrooms here were grown thickly together, so there was no room for\nBurl's body to pass between their stalks, and the rounded heads were\ndeformed and misshapen from their crowdings. Burl spent precious moments\nin trying to force a silent passage, but had to own himself beaten. Then\nhe clambered up upon the spongy mass of mushroom heads, trusting to luck\nthat they would sustain his weight.\n\nThe blackness was intense, so that even the forms of objects before him\nwere lost in obscurity. He moved forward for some ten yards, however,\nwalking gingerly over his precarious foothold. Then he felt rather than\nsaw the opening before him. A body moved below him.\n\nBurl raised his spear, and with a yell plunged down on the back of the\nmoving thing, thrusting his spear with all the force he could command.\nHe landed on a shifting form, but his yell of triumph turned to a scream\nof terror.\n\nThis was not the yielding body of a slender butterfly that he had come\nupon, nor had his spear penetrated the creature's soft flesh. He had\nfallen upon the shining back of one of the huge, meat-eating beetles,\nand his spear had slid across the horny armor, and then stuck fast,\nhaving pierced only the leathery tissue between the insect's head and\nthorax.\n\nBurl's terror was pitiable at the realization, but as nothing to the\nultimate panic which possessed him when the creature beneath him uttered\na grunt of fright and pain, and, spreading its stiff wing-cases wide,\nshot upward in a crazy, panic-stricken, rocket-like flight toward the\nsky.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe Sexton-Beetles\n\n\nBurl fell headforemost upon the spongy top of a huge toadstool that\nsplit with the impact and let him through to the ground beneath,\npowdering him with its fine spores. He came to rest with his naked\nshoulder half-way through the yielding flesh of a mushroom-stalk, and\nlay there for a second, catching his breath to scream again.\n\nThen he heard the whining buzz of his attempted prey. There was\nsomething wrong with the beetle. Burl's spear had struck it in an\nawkward spot, and it was rocketing upward in erratic flight that ended\nin a crash two or three hundreds yards away.\n\nBurl sprang up in an instant. Perhaps, despite his mistake, he had slain\nthis infinitely more worthy victim. He rushed toward the spot where it\nhad fallen.\n\nHis wide blue eyes pierced the darkness well enough to enable him to\nsheer off from masses of toadstools, but he could distinguish no\ndetails--nothing but forms. He heard the beetle floundering upon the\nground; then heard it mount again into the air, more clumsily than\nbefore.\n\nIts wing-beats no longer kept up a sustained note. They thrashed the air\nirregularly and wildly. The flight was zigzag and uncertain, and though\nlonger than the first had been, it ended similarly, in a heavy fall.\nAnother period of floundering, and the beetle took to the air again just\nbefore Burl arrived at the spot.\n\nIt was obviously seriously hurt, and Burl forgot the dangers of the\nnight in his absorption in the chase. He darted after his prey,\nfleet-footed and agile, taking chances that in cold blood he would never\nhave thought of.\n\nTwice, in the pain-racked struggles of the monster beetle, he arrived at\nthe spot where the gigantic insect flung itself about madly, insanely,\nfighting it knew not what, striking out with colossal wings and legs,\ndazed and drunk with agony. And each time it managed to get aloft in\nflight that was weaker and more purposeless.\n\nCrazy, fleeing from the torturing spear that pierced its very vitals,\nthe beetle blundered here and there, floundering among the mushroom\nthickets in spasms that were constantly more prolonged and more\nagonized, but nevertheless flying heavily, lurching drunkenly, managing\nto graze the tops of the toadstools in one more despairing, tormented\nflight.\n\nAnd Burl followed, aflame with the fire of the chase, arriving at the\nscene of each successive, panic-stricken struggle on the ground just\nafter the beetle had taken flight again, but constantly more closely on\nthe heels of the weakening monster.\n\nAt last he came up panting, and found the giant lying upon the earth,\nmoving feebly, apparently unable to rise. How far he was from the tribe,\nBurl did not know, nor did the question occur to him at the moment. He\nwaited for the beetle to be still, trembling with excitement and\neagerness. The struggles of the huge form grew more feeble, and at last\nceased. Burl moved forward and grasped his spear. He wrenched at it to\nthrust again.\n\nIn an instant the beetle had roused itself, and was exerting its last\natom of strength, galvanized into action by the agony caused by Burl's\nseizure of the spear. A great wing-cover knocked Burl twenty feet, and\nflung him against the base of a mushroom, where he lay, half stunned.\nBut then a strangely pungent scent came to his nostrils--the scent of\nthe red mushrooms!\n\nHe staggered to his feet and fled, while behind him the gigantic beetle\ncrashed and floundered--Burl heard a tearing and ripping sound. The\ninsect had torn the covering of one of the red mushrooms, tightly packed\nwith the fatal red dust. At the noise, Burl's speed was doubled, but he\ncould still hear the frantic struggles of the dying beetle grow to a\nvery crescendo of desperation.\n\nThe creature broke free and managed to rise in a final flight, fighting\nfor breath and life, weakened and tortured by the spear and the horrible\nspores of the red mushrooms. Then it crashed suddenly to the earth and\nwas still. The red dust had killed it.\n\nIn time to come, Burl might learn to use the red dust as poison gas had\nbeen used by his ancestors of thirty thousand years before, but now he\nwas frightened and alone, lost from his tribe, and with no faintest\nnotion of how to find them. He crouched beneath a huge toadstool and\nwaited for dawn, listening with terrified apprehension for the ripping\nsound that would mean the bursting of another of the red mushrooms.\n\nOnly the wing beats of night-flying creatures came to his ears, however,\nand the discordant noises of the four-foot truffle-beetles as they\nroamed the aisles of the mushroom forests, seeking the places beneath\nwhich their instinct told them fungoid dainties awaited the courageous\nminer. The eternal dripping of the raindrops falling at long intervals\nfrom the overhanging clouds formed a soft obbligato to the whole.\n\nBurl listened, knowing there were red toadstools all about, but not once\nduring the whole of the long, dark hours did the rending noise tell of a\nbursting fungus casting loose its freight of deadly dust upon the air.\nOnly when day came again, and the chill dampness of the night was\nsucceeded by the steaming humidity of the morning, did a tall pyramid of\nbrownish-red stuff leap suddenly into the air from a ripped mushroom\ncovering.\n\nThen Burl stood up and looked around. Here and there, all over the whole\ncountryside, slowly and at intervals, the cones of fatal red sprang into\nthe air. Had Burl lived thirty thousand years earlier, he might have\nlikened the effect to that of shells bursting from a leisurely\nbombardment, but as it was he saw in them only fresh and inexorable\ndangers added to an already peril-ridden existence.\n\nA hundred yards from where he had hidden during the night the body of\nhis victim lay, crumpled up and limp. Burl approached speculatively. He\nhad come even before the ants appeared to take their toll of the\ncarcass, and not even a buzzing flesh-fly had placed its maggots on the\nunresisting form.\n\nThe long, whiplike antenn\u00e6 lay upon the carpet of mold and rust, and the\nfiercely toothed legs were drawn close against the body. The\nmany-faceted eyes stared unseeingly, and the stiff and horny wing-cases\nwere rent and torn.\n\nWhen Burl went to the other side of the dead beetle he saw something\nthat filled him with elation. His spear had been held between his body\nand the beetle's during that mad flight, and at the final crash, when\nBurl shot away from the fear-crazed insect, the weight of his body had\nforced the spearpoint between the joints of the corselet and the neck.\nEven if the red dust had not finished the creature, the spear wound in\ntime would have ended its life.\n\nBurl was thrilled once more by his superlative greatness, and\nconveniently forgot that it was the red dust that had actually\nadministered the _coup de gr\u00e2ce_. It was so much more pleasant to look\nupon himself as the mighty slayer that he hacked off one of the\nbarb-edged limbs to carry back to his tribe in evidence of his feat. He\ntook the long antenn\u00e6, too, as further proof.\n\nThen he remembered that he did not know where his tribe was to be found.\nHe had no faintest idea of the direction in which the beetle had flown.\nAs a matter of fact, the course of the beetle had been in turn directed\ntoward every point of the compass, and there was no possible way of\ntelling the relation of its final landing-place to the point from which\nit had started.\n\nBurl wrestled with his problem for an hour, and then gave up in disgust.\nHe set off at random, with the leg of the huge insect flung over his\nshoulder and the long antenn\u00e6 clasped in his hand with his spear. He\nturned to look at his victim of the night before just before plunging\ninto the near-by mushroom forest, and saw that it was already the center\nof a mass of tiny black bodies, pulling and hacking at the tough armor,\nand carving out great lumps of the succulent flesh to be carried to the\nnear-by ant city.\n\nIn the teeming life of the insect world death is an opportunity for the\nsurvivors. There is a strangely tense and fearful competition for the\nbodies of the slain. There had been barely an hour of daylight in which\nthe ants might seek for provender, yet in that little time the freshly\nkilled beetle had been found and was being skilfully and carefully\nexploited. When the body of one of the larger insects fell to the\nground, there was a mighty rush, a fierce race, among all the tribes of\nscavengers to see who should be first.\n\nUsually the ants had come upon the scene and were inquisitively\nexploring the carcass long before even the flesh-flies had arrived, who\ndropped their living maggots upon the creature. The blue-bottles came\nstill later, to daub their masses of white eggs about the delicate\nmembranes of the eye.\n\nAnd while all the preceding scavengers were at work, furtive beetles and\ntiny insects burrowed below the reeking body to attack the highly\nscented flesh from a fresh angle.\n\nEach working independently of the others, they commonly appeared in the\norder of the delicacy of the sense which could lead them to a source of\nfood, though accident could and sometimes did afford one group of\nworkers in putrescence an advantage over the others.\n\nThus, sometimes a blue-bottle anticipated even the eager ants, and again\nthe very flesh-flies dropped their squirming offspring upon a limp form\nthat was already being undermined by white-bellied things working in the\ndarkness below the body.\n\nBurl grimaced at the busy ants and buzzing flies, and disappeared into\nthe mushroom forest. Here for a long time he moved cautiously and\nsilently through the aisles of tangled stalks and the spongy, round\nheads of the fungoids. Now and then he saw one of the red toadstools,\nand made a wide detour around it. Twice they burst within his sight,\ncircumscribed as his vision was by the toadstools among which he was\ntraveling.\n\nEach time he ran hastily to put as much distance as possible between\nhimself and the deadly red dust. He traveled for an hour or more,\nlooking constantly for familiar landmarks that might guide him to his\ntribe. He knew that if he came upon any place he had seen while with his\ntribe he could follow the path they had traveled and in time rejoin\nthem.\n\nFor many hours he went on, alert for signs of danger. He was quite\nignorant of the fact that there were such things as points of the\ncompass, and though he had a distinct notion that he was not moving in a\nstraight line, he did not realize that he was actually moving in a\ncolossal half-circle. After walking steadily for nearly four hours he\nwas no more than three miles in a direct line from his starting-point.\nAs it happened, his uncertainty of direction was fortunate.\n\nThe night before the tribe had been feeding happily upon one of the\nimmense edible mushrooms, when they heard Burl's abruptly changing cry.\nIt had begun as a shout of triumph, and ended as a scream of fear. Then\nthey heard hurried wing-beats as a creature rose into the air in a\nscurry of desperation. The throbbing of huge wings ended in a heavy\nfall, followed by another flight.\n\nVelvety darkness masked the sky, and the tribesmen could only stare off\ninto the blackness, where their leader had vanished, and begin to\ntremble, wondering what they should do in a strange country with no bold\nchief to guide them.\n\nHe was the first man to whom the tribe had ever offered allegiance, but\ntheir submission had been all the more complete for that fact, and his\nloss was the more appalling.\n\nBurl had mistaken their lack of timidity. He had thought it\nindependence, and indifference to him. As a matter of fact, it was\nsecurity because the tribe felt safe under his tutelage. Now that he had\nvanished, and in a fashion that seemed to mean his death, their old\nfears returned to them reenforced by the strangeness of their\nsurroundings.\n\nThey huddled together and whispered their fright to one another,\nlistening the while in panic-stricken apprehension for signs of danger.\nThe tribesmen visualized Burl caught in fiercely toothed limbs, being\nrent and torn in mid air by horny, insatiable jaws, his blood falling in\ngreat spurts toward the earth below. They caught a faint, reedy cry, and\nshuddered, pressing closer together.\n\nAnd so through the long night they waited in trembling silence. Had a\nhunting spider appeared among them they would not have lifted a hand to\ndefend themselves, but would have fled despairingly, would probably have\nscattered and lost touch with one another, and spent the remainder of\ntheir lives as solitary fugitives, snatching fear-ridden rest in strange\nhiding-places.\n\nBut day came again, and they looked into each other's eyes, reading in\neach the selfsame panic and fear. Saya was probably the most pitiful of\nall the group. Burl was to have been her mate, and her face was white\nand drawn beyond that of any of the rest of the tribefolk.\n\nWith the day, they did not move, but remained clustered about the huge\nmushroom on which they had been feeding the night before. They spoke in\nhushed and fearful tones, huddled together, searching all the horizon\nfor insect enemies. Saya would not eat, but sat still, staring before\nher in unseeing indifference. Burl was dead.\n\nA hundred yards from where they crouched a red mushroom glistened in the\npale light of the new day. Its tough skin was taut and bulging,\nresisting the pressure of the spores within. But slowly, as the morning\nwore on, some of the moisture that had kept the skin soft and flaccid\nduring the night evaporated.\n\nThe skin had a strong tendency to contract, like green leather when\ndrying. The spores within it strove to expand. The opposing forces\nproduced a tension that grew greater and greater as more and more of the\nmoisture was absorbed by the air. At last the skin could hold no longer.\n\nWith a ripping sound that could be heard for hundreds of feet, the tough\nwrapping split and tore across its top, and with a hollow, booming noise\nthe compressed mass of deadly spores rushed into the air, making a\npyramidal cloud of brown-red dust some sixty feet in height.\n\nThe tribesmen quivered at the noise and faced the dust cloud for a\nfleeting instant, then ran pell-mell to escape the slowly moving tide of\ndeath as the almost imperceptible breeze wafted it slowly toward them.\nMen and women, boys and girls, they fled in a mad rush from the deadly\nstuff, not pausing to see that even as it advanced it settled slowly to\nthe ground, nor stopping to observe its path that they might step aside\nand let it go safely by.\n\nSaya fled with the rest, but without their extreme panic. She fled\nbecause the others had done so, and ran more carelessly, struggling with\na half-formed idea that it did not particularly matter whether she were\ncaught or not.\n\nShe fell slightly behind the others, without being noticed. Then quite\nabruptly a stone turned under her foot, and she fell headlong, striking\nher head violently against a second stone. Then she lay quite still\nwhile the red cloud billowed slowly toward her, drifting gently in the\nfaint, hardly perceptible breeze.\n\nIt drew nearer and nearer, settling slowly, but still a huge and\nmenacing mass of deadly dust. It gradually flattened out, too, so that\nthough it had been a rounded cone at first, it flowed over the minor\ninequalities of the ground as a huge and tenuous leech might have\ncrawled, sucking from all breathing creatures the life they had within\nthem.\n\nA hundred and fifty yards away, a hundred yards away, then only fifty\nyards away. From where Saya lay unconscious on the earth, eddies within\nthe moving mass could be seen, and the edges took on a striated\nappearance, telling of the curling of the dust wreaths in the larger\nmass of deadly powder.\n\nThe deliberate advance kept on, seeming almost purposeful. It would have\nseemed possible to draw from the unhurried, menacing movement of the\npoisonous stuff that some malign intelligence was concealed in it, that\nit was, in fact, a living creature. But when the misty edges of the\ncloud were no more than twenty-five yards from Saya's prostrate body a\nbreeze from one side sprang up--a vagrant, fitful little breeze, that\nfirst halted the red cloud and threw it into confusion and then drove it\nto one side, so that it passed Saya without harming her, though a single\ntrailing wisp of dark-red mist floated very close to her.\n\nThen for a time Saya lay still indeed, only her breast rising and\nfalling gently with faint and irregular breaths. Her head had struck a\nsharp-edged stone in her fall, and a tiny pool of sticky red had\ngathered from the wound.\n\nPerhaps thirty feet from where she lay, three small toadstools grew in a\nlittle clump, their bases so close together that they seemed but one.\nFrom between two of them, however, just where they parted, twin tufts of\nreddish threads appeared, twinkling back and forth, and in and out. As\nif they had given some reassuring sign, two slender antenn\u00e6 followed,\nthen bulging eyes, and then a small black body which had bright-red\nscalloped markings upon the wing-cases.\n\nIt was a tiny beetle no more than eight inches long--a burying-beetle.\nIt drew near Saya's body and clambered upon her, explored the ground by\nher side, moving all the time in feverish haste, and at last dived into\nthe ground beneath her shoulder, casting back a little shower of hastily\ndug earth as it disappeared.\n\nTen minutes later another similar insect appeared, and upon the heels of\nthe second a third. Each of them made the same hasty examination, and\neach dived under the still form. Presently the earth seemed to billow at\na spot along Saya's side, then at another. Perhaps ten minutes after the\narrival of the third beetle a little rampart had reared itself all about\nSaya's body, precisely following the outline of her form. Then her body\nmoved slightly, in a number of tiny jerks, and seemed to settle perhaps\nhalf an inch into the ground.\n\nThe burying beetles were of those who exploited the bodies of the\nfallen. Working from below, they excavated the earth from the under side\nof such prizes as they came upon, then turned upon their backs and\nthrust with their legs, jerking the body so it sank into the shallow\nexcavation they had prepared.\n\nThe process would be repeated until at last the whole of the gift of\nfortune had sunk below the surrounding surface and the loosened earth\nfell in upon the top, thus completing the inhumation.\n\nThen in the darkness the beetles would feast and rear their young,\ngorging upon the plentiful supply of succulent foodstuff they had hidden\nfrom jealous fellow scavengers above them.\n\nBut Saya was alive. Thirty thousand years before, when scientists\nexamined into the habits of the burying-beetles, or the sexton-beetles,\nthey had declared that fresh meat or living meat would not be touched.\nThey based their statement solely upon the fact that the insects (then\ntiny creatures indeed) did not appear until the trap-meat placed by the\ninvestigators had remained untouched for days.\n\nConditions had changed in thirty thousand years. The ever-present ants\nand the sharp-eyed flies were keen rivals of the brightly arrayed\nbeetles. Usually the tribes of creatures who worked in the darkness\nbelow ground came after the ants had taken their toll, and the flies\nsipped daintily.\n\nWhen Saya fell unconscious upon the ground, however, it was the one\naccident that caused the burying-beetle to find her first, before the\nants had come to tear the flesh from her slender, soft-skinned body. She\nbreathed gently and irregularly, her face drawn with the sorrow of the\nnight before, while desperately hurrying beetles swarmed beneath her\nbody, channeling away the earth so that she would sink lower and lower\ninto the ground.\n\nAn inch, and a long wait. Then she sank slowly a second inch. The\nbright-red tufts of thread appeared again, and a beetle made his way to\nthe open air. He moved hastily about, inspecting the progress of the\nwork. He dived below again. Another inch, and after a long time another\ninch was excavated.\n\nBurl stepped out from a group of over-shadowing toadstools and halted.\nHe cast his eyes over the landscape, and was struck by its familiarity.\nIt was, in point of fact, very near the spot he had left the night\nbefore, in pursuit of a colossal wounded beetle.\n\nBurl moved back and forth, trying to account for the sensation of\nrecognition, and then trying to approximate the place from which he had\nlast seen it.\n\nHe passed within fifty feet of the spot where Saya lay, now half buried\nin the ground. The loose earth cast up about her body had begun to fall\nin little rivulets upon her. One of her shoulders was already screened\nfrom view.\n\nBurl passed on, unseeing. He was puzzling over the direction from which\nhe had seen the particular section of countryside before him. Perhaps a\nlittle farther on he would come to the place. He hurried a little. In a\nmoment he recognized his location. There was the great edible mushroom,\nhalf broken away, from which the tribe had been feeding. There were the\nmining bee burrows.\n\nHis feet stirred up a fine dust, and he stopped short. A red mushroom\nhad covered the earth with a thin layer of its impalpable, deadly\npowder. Burl understood why the tribe had gone, and a cold sweat came\nupon his body. Was Saya safe, or had the whole tribe succumbed to the\npoisonous stuff? Had they all, men and women and children, died in\nconvulsions of gasping strangulation?\n\nHe hurried to retrace his footsteps. There was a fragment of mushrooms\non the ground. Here was a spear, cast away by one of the tribesmen in\nhis flight. Burl broke into a run.\n\nThe little excavation into which Saya was sinking, inch by inch, was all\nof twenty-five feet to the right of the path. Burl dashed on, frantic\nwith anxiety about the tribe, but most of all about Saya. Saya's body\nquivered and sank a fraction more into the earth.\n\nHalf a dozen little rivulets of dirt were tumbling upon her body now. In\na matter of minutes she would be hidden from view. Burl ran madly past\nher, too busy searching the mushroom thickets before him with his eyes\nto dream of looking upon the ground.\n\nTwenty yards from a huge toadstool thicket a noise arrested him sharply.\nThere was a crashing and breaking of the brittle, spongy growths. Twin\ntapering antenn\u00e6 appeared, and then a monster beetle lurched into the\nopen space, its horrible, gaping jaws stretched wide.\n\nIt was all of eight feet long, and its body was held up from the ground\nby six crooked, saw-toothed limbs. Its huge multiple eyes stared with\nmachinelike preoccupation at the world.\n\nIt advanced deliberately, with a clanking and clashing as of a hideous\nmachine. Burl fled on the instant, running as madly away from the beetle\nas he had a moment before been running toward it.\n\nA little depression in the earth was before him. He did not swerve, but\nmade to leap it. As he shot over it, however, the glint of pink skin\ncaught his eye, and there was impressed upon his brain with photographic\ncompleteness the picture of Saya, lying limp and helpless, sinking\nslowly into the ground, with tiny rills of earth falling down the sides\nof the excavation upon her. It seemed to Burl's eye that she quivered\nslightly as he saw.\n\nThere was a terrific struggle within Burl. Behind him the colossal\nmeat-eating beetle. Beneath him Saya, whom he loved. There was certain\ndeath lurching toward him on evilly glittering legs, and there was life\nfor his race and tribe lying in the shallow pit.\n\nHe turned, aware with a sudden reckless glow that he was throwing away\nhis life, aware that he was deliberately giving himself over to death,\nand stood on the side of the little pit nearest the great beetle, his\npuny spear held defiantly at the ready. In his left hand he held just\nsuch a leg as those which bore the living creature toward him. He had\ntorn it from the body of just such a monster but a few hours ago, a\nmonster in whose death he had had a share. With a yell of insane\ndefiance, he flung the fiercely toothed limb at his advancing opponent.\n\nThe sharp teeth cut into the base of one of the beetle's antenn\u00e6, and it\nducked clumsily, then seized the missile in its fierce jaws and crushed\nit in frenzy of rage. There was meat within it, sweet and juicy meat\nthat pleased the beetle's palate.\n\nIt forgot the man, standing there, waiting for death. It crunched the\nmissile that had attacked it, eating the palatable contents of the horny\narmor, confusing the blow with the object that had delivered it, and\nevidently satisfied that an enemy had been conquered and was being\ndevoured. A moment later it turned and lumbered off to investigate\nanother mushroom thicket.\n\nAnd Burl turned quickly and dragged Saya's limp form from the grave that\nhad been prepared for it by the busy insect scavengers. Earth fell from\nher shoulders, from her hair, and from the mass of yellow fur about her\nmiddle, and three little beetles with black and red markings scurried in\nterrified haste for cover, while Burl bore Saya to a resting-place of\nsoft mold.\n\nBurl was an ignorant savage, and to him Saya's deathlike unconsciousness\nwas like death itself, but dumb misery smote him, and he laid her down\ngently, while tears came to his eyes and he called her name again and\nagain in an agony of grief.\n\nFor an hour he sat there beside her, a man so lately pleased with\nhimself above all creatures for having slain one huge beetle and put\nanother to flight, as he would have looked upon it, now a\nbroken-hearted, little pink-skinned man, weeping like a child, hunched\nup and bowed over with sorrow.\n\nThen Saya slowly opened her eyes and stirred weakly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe Forest of Death\n\n\nThey were oblivious to everything but each other, Saya resting in still\nhalf-incredulous happiness against Burl's shoulder while he told her in\nlittle, jerky sentences of his pursuit of the colossal flying beetle, of\nhis search for the tribe, and then his discovery of her apparently\nlifeless body.\n\nWhen he spoke of the monster that had lurched from the mushroom thicket,\nand of the desperation with which he had faced it, Saya pressed close\nand looked at him with wondering and wonderful eyes. She could\nunderstand his willingness to die, believing her dead. A little while\nbefore she had felt the same indifference to life.\n\nA timid, frightened whisper roused them from their absorption, and they\nlooked up. One of the tribesmen stood upon one foot some distance away,\nstaring at them, almost convinced that he looked upon the living dead. A\nsudden movement on the part of either of them would have sent him in a\npanic back into the mushroom forest. Two or three blond heads bobbed and\nvanished among the tangled stalks. Wide and astonished eyes gazed at the\ntwo they had believed the prey of malignant creatures.\n\nThe tribe had come slowly back to the mushroom they had been eating,\nleaderless, and convinced that Saya had fallen a victim to the deadly\ndust. Instead, they found her sitting by the side of their chief,\napparently restored to them in some miraculous fashion.\n\nBurl spoke, and the pink-skinned people came timorously from their\nhiding-places. They approached warily and formed a half-circle before\nthe seated pair. Burl spoke again, and presently one of the bravest\ndared approach and touch him. Instantly a babble of the crude and labial\nlanguage spoken by the tribe broke out. Awed questions and exclamations\nof thankfulness, then curious interrogations filled the air.\n\nBurl, for once, showed some common sense. Instead of telling them in his\nusual vainglorious fashion of the adventures he had undergone, he merely\ncast down the two long and tapering antenn\u00e6 from the flying beetle that\nhe had torn from its dead body. They looked at them, and recognized\ntheir origin. Amazement and admiration showed upon their faces. Then\nBurl rose and abruptly ordered two of the men to make a chair of their\nhands for Saya. She was weak from the effects of the blow she had\nreceived. The two men humbly advanced and did as they were bid.\n\nThen the march was taken up again, more slowly than before, because of\nSaya as a burden, but none the less steadily. Burl led his people across\nthe country, marching in advance and with every nerve alert for signs of\ndanger, but with more confidence and less timidity than he had ever\ndisplayed before.\n\nAll that noontime and that afternoon they filed steadily along, the\ntribesfolk keeping in a compact group close behind Burl. The man who had\nthrown away his spear had recovered it on an order from Burl, and the\nlittle party fairly bristled with weapons, though Burl knew well that\nthey were liable to be cast away as impediments if flight should be\nnecessary.\n\nHe was determined that his people should learn to fight the great\ncreatures about them, instead of depending upon their legs for escape.\nHe had led them in an attack upon great slugs, but they were defenseless\ncreatures, incapable of more dangerous maneuvers than spasmodic jerkings\nof their great bodies.\n\nThe next time danger should threaten them, and especially if it came\nwhile their new awe of him held good, he was resolved to force them to\njoin him in fighting it.\n\nHe had not long to wait for an opportunity to strengthen the spirit of\nhis followers by a successful battle. The clouds toward the west were\ntaking on a dull-red hue, which was the nearest to a sunset that was\never seen in the world of Burl's experience, when a bumble bee droned\nheavily over their heads, making for its hive.\n\nThe little group of people on the ground looked up and saw a scanty load\nof pollen packed in the stiff bristles of the insect's hind legs. The\nbees of the world had a hard time securing food upon the nearly\nflowerless planet, but this one had evidently made a find. Its crop was\nnearly filled with hard-gathered, viscous honey destined for the hival\nstore.\n\nIt sped onward, heavily, its almost transparent wings mere blurs in the\nair from the rapidity of their vibration. Burl saw its many-faceted eyes\nstaring before it in worried preoccupation as it soared in laborious\nspeed over his head, some fifty feet up.\n\nHe dropped his glance, and then his eyes lighted with excitement. A\nslender-bodied wasp was shooting upward from an ambush it had found in a\nthicket of toadstools. It darted swiftly and gracefully upon the bee,\nwhich swerved and tried to flee. The droning buzz of the bee's wings\nrose to a higher note as it strove to increase its speed. The more\ndelicately formed wasp headed the clumsier insect back.\n\nThe bee turned again and fled in terror. Each of the insects was\nslightly more than four feet in length, but the bee was much the\nheavier, and it could not attain the speed of which the wasp was\ncapable.\n\nThe graceful form of the hunting insect rapidly overhauled its fleeing\nprey, and the wasp dashed in and closed with the bee at a point almost\nover the heads of the tribesmen. In a clawing, biting tangle of\nthrashing, transparent wings and black bodies, the two creatures tumbled\nto the earth. They fell perhaps thirty yards from where Burl stood\nwatching.\n\nOver and over the two insects rolled, now one uppermost, and then the\nother. The bee was struggling desperately to insert her sting in the\nmore supple body of her adversary. She writhed and twisted, fighting\nwith jaw and mandible, wing and claw.\n\nThe wasp was uppermost, and the bee lay on her back, fighting in\npanic-stricken desperation. The wasp saw an opening, her jaws darted in,\nand there was an instant of confusion. Then suddenly the bee, dazed, was\nupright with the wasp upon her. A movement too quick for the eye to\nfollow--and the bee collapsed. The wasp had bitten her in the neck where\nall the nerve-cords passed, and the bee was dead.\n\nBurl waited a moment more, aflame with excitement. He knew, as did all\nthe tribefolk, what might happen next. When he saw the second act of the\ntragedy well begun, Burl snapped quick and harsh orders to his\nspear-armed men, and they followed him in a wavering line, their weapons\ntightly clutched.\n\nKnowing the habits of the insects as they were forced to know them, they\nknew that the venture was one of the least dangerous they could\nundertake with fighting creatures the size of the wasp, but the idea of\nattacking the great creatures whose sharp stings could annihilate any of\nthem with a touch, the mere thought of taking the initiative was\nappalling. Had their awe of Burl been less complete they would not have\ndreamed of following him.\n\nThe second act of the tragedy had begun. The bee had been slain by the\nwasp, a carnivorous insect normally, but the wasp knew that sweet honey\nwas concealed in the half-filled crop of the bee. Had the bee arrived\nsafely at the hive, the sweet and sticky liquid would have been\ndisgorged and added to the hival store. Now, though the bee's journey\nwas ended and its flesh was to be crunched and devoured by the wasp, the\nhoney was the first object of the pirate's solicitude.[1] The dead\ninsect was rolled over upon its back, and with eager haste the slayer\nbegan to exploit the body.\n\n[Footnote 1: The pirate is the _Philanthus Apivorus_.]\n\nBurl and his men were creeping nearer, but with a gesture Burl bade them\nhalt for a moment. The wasp's first move was to force the disgorgement\nof the honey from the bee's crop, and with feverish eagerness it pressed\nupon the limp body until the shining, sticky liquid appeared. Then the\nwasp began in ghoulish ecstasy to lick up the sweet stuff, utterly\nabsorbed in the feast.\n\nMany thousands of years before, the absorption of the then tiny insect\nhad been noticed when engaged in a similar feat, and it was recorded in\nbooks moldered into dust long ages before Burl's birth that its rapture\nwas so great that it had been known to fall a victim to a second bandit\nwhile engaged in the horrible banquet.\n\nBurl had never read the books, but he had been told that the pirate\nwould continue its feast even though seized by a greater enemy, unable\nto tear itself from the nectar gathered by the creature it had slain.\n\nThe tribesmen waited until the wasp had begun its orgy, licking up the\ntoothsome stuff disgorged by its dead prey. It ate in gluttonous haste,\nblind to all sights, deaf to all sounds, able to think of nothing,\nconceive of nothing, but the delights of the liquid it was devouring.\n\nAt a signal the tribesmen darted forward. They wavered when near the\nslender-waisted gourmet, however, and Burl was the first to thrust his\nspear with all his strength into the thinly armored body.\n\nThen the others took courage. A short, horny spear penetrated the very\nvitals of the wasp. A club fell with terrific impact upon the slender\nwaist. There was a crackling, and the long, spidery limbs quivered and\nwrithed, while the tribesmen fell back in fear, but without cause.\n\nBurl struck again, and the wasp fell into two writhing halves, helpless\nfor harm. The pink-skinned men danced in triumph, and the women and\nchildren ventured near, delighted.\n\nOnly Burl noticed that even as the wasp was dying, sundered and pierced\nwith spears, its slender tongue licked out in one last, ecstatic taste\nof the nectar that had been its undoing.\n\nBurdened with the pollen-covered legs of the giant bee, and filled with\nthe meat from choice portions of the wasp's muscular limbs, the tribe\nresumed its journey. This time Burl had men behind him, still timid,\nstill prone to flee at the slightest alarm, but infinitely more\ndependable than they had been before.\n\nThey had attacked and slain a wasp whose sting would have killed any of\nthem. They had done battle under the leadership of Burl, whose spear had\nstruck the first blow. Henceforth they were sharers, in a mild way, of\nhis transcendent glory, and henceforth they were more like followers of\na mighty chief and less like spineless worshipers of a demigod whose\nfeats they were too timid to emulate.\n\nThat night they hid among a group of giant puff-balls, feasting on the\nloads of meat they had carried thus far with them. Burl watched them now\nwithout jealousy of their good spirits. He and Saya sat a little apart,\nhappy to be near each other, speaking in low tones. After a time\ndarkness fell, and the tribefolk became shapeless bodies speaking in\nvoices that grew drowsy and were silent. The black forms of the\ntoadstool heads and huge puff-balls were but darker against a dark sky.\n\nThe nightly rain began to fall, drop by drop, drop by drop, upon the\ndamp and humid earth. Only Burl remained awake for a little while, and\nhis last waking thought was of pride, disinterested pride. He had the\nfirst reward of the ruler, gratification in the greatness of his people.\n\nThe red mushrooms had continued to show their glistening heads, though\nBurl thought they were less numerous than in the territory from which\nthe tribe had fled. All along the route, now to the right, now to the\nleft, they had burst and sent their masses of deadly dust into the air.\n\nMany times the tribefolk had been forced to make a detour to avoid a\nslowly spreading cloud of death-dealing spores. Once or twice their\nescapes had been narrow indeed, but so far there had been no deaths.\n\nBurl had observed that the mushrooms normally burst only in the daytime,\nand for a while had thought of causing his followers to do their\njourneying in the night. Only the obvious disadvantages of such a\ncourse--the difficulty of discovering food, and the prowling spiders\nthat roamed in the darkness--had prevented him. The idea still stayed\nwith him, however, and two days after the fight with the hunting wasp he\nput it in practise.\n\nThe tribe came to the top of a small rise in the ground. For an hour\nthey had been marching and counter-marching to avoid the suddenly\nappearing clouds of dust. Once they had been nearly hemmed in, and only\nby mad sprinting did they escape when three of the dull-red clouds\nseemed to flow together, closing three sides of a circle.\n\nThey came to the little hillock and halted. Before them stretched a\nplain all of four miles wide, colored a brownish brick-red by masses of\nmushrooms. They had seen mushroom forests before, and knew of the\ndangers they presented, but there was none so deadly as the plain before\nthem. To right and left it stretched as far as the eye could see, but\nfar away on its farther edge Burl caught a glimpse of flowing water.\n\nOver the plain itself a dull-red haze seemed to float. It was nothing\nmore or less than a cloud of the deadly spores, dispersed and\nindefinite, constantly replenished by the freshly bursting red\nmushrooms.\n\nWhile the people stood and watched a dozen thick columns of dust rose\ninto the air from scattered points here and there upon the plain,\nsettling slowly again, but leaving behind them enough of their finely\ndivided substance to keep the thin red haze over the whole plain in its\noriginal, deadly state.\n\nBurl had seen single red mushrooms before, and even small thickets of\ntwo and three, but here was a plain of millions, literally millions upon\nmillions of the malignant growths. Here was one fungoid forest through\nwhose aisles no monster beetles stalked, and above whose shadowed depths\nno brightly colored butterflies fluttered in joyous abandon. There were\nno loud-voiced crickets singing in its hiding-places, nor bodies of\neagerly foraging ants searching inquisitively for bits of food. It was a\nforest of death, still and silent, quiet and motionless save for the\nsullen columns of red dust that ever and again shot upward from the torn\nand ragged envelope of the bursting mushroom.\n\nBurl and his people watched in wonderment and dismay, but presently a\nhigh resolve came to Burl. The mushrooms never burst at night, and the\ndeadly dust from a subsided cloud was not deadly in the morning. As a\nmatter of fact the rain that fell every night made it no more than a\nsodden, thin film of reddish mud by daybreak, mud which dried and caked.\n\nBurl did not know what occurred, but knew the result. At night or in\nearly morning, the danger from the red mushrooms was slight. Therefore\nhe would lead his people through the very jaws of death that night. He\nwould lead them through the deadly aisles of this, the forest of\nmalignant growths, the place of lurking annihilation.\n\nIt was an act of desperation, and the resolution to carry it through\nleft Burl in a state of mind that kept him from observing one thing that\nwould have ended all the struggles of his tribe at once. Perhaps a\nquarter-mile from the edge of the red forest three or four giant\ncabbages grew, thrusting their colossal leaves upward toward the sky.\n\nAnd on the cabbages a dozen lazy slugs fed leisurely, ignoring\ncompletely the red haze that was never far from them and sometimes\ncovered them. Burl saw them, but the oddity of their immunity from the\neffects of the red dust did not strike him. He was fighting to keep his\nresolution intact. If he had only realized the significance of what he\nsaw, however--\n\nThe slugs were covered with a thick soft fur. The tribespeople wore\ngarments of that same material. The fur protected the slugs, and could\nhave made the tribe immune to the deadly red dust if they had only\nknown. The slugs breathed through a row of tiny holes upon their backs,\nas the mature insects breathed through holes upon the bottom of their\nabdomens, and the soft fur formed a mat of felt which arrested the fine\nparticles of deadly dust, while allowing the pure air to pass through.\nIt formed, in effect, a natural gas-mask which the tribesmen should have\nadopted, but which they did not discover or invent.\n\nThe remainder of that day they waited in a curious mixture of resolve\nand fear. The tribe was rapidly reaching a point where it would follow\nBurl over a thousand-foot cliff, and it needed some such blind\nconfidence to make them prepare to go through the forest of the million\ndeadly mushrooms.\n\nThe waiting was a strain, but the actual journey was a nightmare. Burl\nknew that the toadstools did not burst of themselves during the night,\nbut he knew that the beetle on which he had taken his involuntary ride\nhad crashed against one in the darkness, and that the fatal dust had\npoured out. He warned his people to be cautious, and led them down the\nslope of the hill through the blackness.\n\nFor hours they stumbled on in utter darkness, with the pungent, acrid\nodor of the red growths constantly in their nostrils. They put out their\nhands and touched the flabby, damp stalks of the monstrous things. They\nstumbled and staggered against the leathery skins of the malignant\nfungoids.\n\nDeath was all about them. At no time during all the dark hours of the\nnight was there a moment when they could not reach out their hands and\ntouch a fungus growth that might burst at their touch and fill the air\nwith poisonous dust, so that all of them would die in gasping, choking\nagony.\n\nAnd worst of all, before half an hour was past they had lost all sense\nof direction, so that they stumbled on blindly through the utter\nblackness, not knowing whether they were headed toward the river that\nmight be their salvation or were wandering hopelessly deeper and deeper\ninto the silent depths of the forest of strangled things.\n\nWhen day came again and the mushrooms sent their columns of fatal dust\ninto the air would they gasp and fight for breath in the red haze that\nwould float like a tenuous cloud above the forest? Would they breathe in\nflames of firelike torment and die slowly, or would the red dust be\nmerciful and slay them quickly?\n\nThey felt their way like blind folk, devoid of hope and curiously\nunafraid. Only their hearts were like heavy, cold weights in their\nbreasts, and they shouldered aside the swollen sacs of the red mushrooms\nwith a singular apathy as they followed Burl slowly through the midst of\ndeath.\n\nMany times in their journeying they knew that dead creatures were near\nby--moths, perhaps, that had blundered into a distended growth which\nhad burst upon the impact and killed the thing that had touched it.\n\nNo busy insect scavengers ventured into this plain of silence to salvage\nthe bodies, however. The red haze preserved the sanctuary of malignance\ninviolate. During the day no creature might hope to approach its red\naisles and dust-carpeted clearings, and at night the slow-dropping rain\nfell only upon the rounded heads of the mushrooms.\n\nIn all the space of the forest, only the little band of hopeless people,\nplodding on behind Burl in the velvet blackness, callously rubbed\nshoulders with death in the form of the red and glistening mushrooms.\nOver all the dank expanse of the forest, the only sound was the dripping\nof the slow and sodden rainfall that began at nightfall and lasted until\nday came again.\n\nThe sky began to grow faintly gray as the sun rose behind the banks of\noverhanging clouds. Burl stopped short and uttered what was no more than\na groan. He was in a little circular clearing, and the twisted,\nmonstrous forms of the deadly mushrooms were all about. There was not\nyet enough light for colors to appear, and the hideous, almost obscene\nshapes of the loathsome growths on every side showed only as mocking,\nleering silhouettes as of malicious demons rejoicing at the coming doom\nof the gray-faced, huddled tribefolk.\n\nBurl stood still, drooping in discouragement upon his spear, the\nfeathery moth's antenn\u00e6 bound upon his forehead shadowed darkly against\nthe graying sky. Soon the mushrooms would begin to burst--\n\nThen, suddenly, he lifted his head, encouragement and delight upon his\nfeatures. He had heard the ripple of running water. His followers looked\nat him with dawning hope. Without a word, Burl began to run, and they\nfollowed him more slowly. His voice came back to them in a shout of\ndelight.\n\nThen they, too, broke into a jog-trot. In a moment they had emerged from\nthe thick tangle of brownish-red stalks and were upon the banks of a\nwide and swiftly running river, the same river whose gleam Burl had\ncaught the day before from the farther side of the mushroom forest.\n\nOnce before Burl had floated down a river upon a mushroom raft. Then his\njourney had been involuntary and unlooked for. He had been carried far\nfrom his tribe and far from Saya, and his heart had been filled with\ndesolation.\n\nNow he viewed the swiftly running current with eager delight. He cast\nhis eyes up and down the bank. Here and there the river-bank rose in a\nlow bluff, and thick shelf-growths stretched out above the water.\n\nBurl was busy in an instant, stabbing the hard growths with his spear\nand striving to wrench them free. The tribesmen stared at him,\nuncomprehending, but at an order from him they did likewise.\n\nSoon a dozen thick masses of firm, light fungus lay upon the shore where\nit shelved gently into the water. Burl began to explain what they were\nto do, but one or two of the men dared remonstrate, saying humbly that\nthey were afraid to part from him. If they might embark upon the same\nthing with him, they would be safe, but otherwise they were afraid.\n\nBurl cast an apprehensive glance at the sky. Day was coming rapidly on.\nSoon the red mushrooms would begin to shoot their columns of deadly dust\ninto the air. This was no time to pause and deliberate. Then Saya spoke\nsoftly.\n\nBurl listened, and made a mighty sacrifice. He took his gorgeous velvet\ncloak from his shoulders--it was made from the wing of a great moth--and\ntore it into a dozen long, irregular pieces, tearing it along the lines\nof the sinews that reinforced it. He planted his spear upright in the\nlargest piece of shelf-fungus and caused his followers to do likewise,\nthen fastened the strips of sinew and velvet to his spear-shaft, and\nordered them to do the same to the other spears.\n\nIn a matter of minutes the dozen tiny rafts were bobbing on the water,\nclustered about the larger, central bit. Then, one by one, the tribefolk\ntook their places, and Burl shoved off.\n\nThe agglomeration of cranky, unseaworthy bits of shelf-fungus moved\nslowly out from the shore until the current caught it. Burl and Saya sat\nupon the central bit, with the other trustful but somewhat frightened\npink-skinned people all about them. And, as they began to move between\nthe mushroom-lined banks of the river and the mist of the night began to\nlift from its surface, far in the interior of the forest of the red\nfungoids a column of sullen red leaped into the air. The first of the\nmalignant growths had cast its cargo of poisonous dust into the\nstill-humid atmosphere.\n\nThe conelike column spread out and grew thin, but even after it had sunk\ninto the earth, a reddish taint remained in the air about the place\nwhere it had been. The deadly red haze that hung all through the day\nover the red forest was in process of formation.\n\nBut by that time the unstable fungus rafts were far down the river,\nbobbing and twirling in the current, with the wide-eyed people upon them\ngazing in wonderment at the shores as they glided by. The red mushrooms\ngrew less numerous upon the banks. Other growths took their places.\nMolds and rusts covered the ground as grass had done in ages past.\nMushrooms showed their creamy, rounded heads. Malformed things with\nswollen trunks and branches in strange mockery of the trees they had\nsuperseded made their appearance, and once the tribesmen saw the dark\nbulk of a hunting spider outlined for a moment upon the bank.\n\nAll the long day they rode upon the current, while the insect life that\nhad been absent in the neighborhood of the forest of death made its\nappearance again. Bees once more droned overhead, and wasps and\ndragon-flies. Four-inch mosquitoes made their appearance, to be fought\noff by the tribefolk with lusty blows, and glittering beetles and\nshining flies, whose bodies glittered with a metallic luster, buzzed and\nflew above the water.\n\nHuge butterflies once more were seen, dancing above the steaming,\nfestering earth in an apparent ecstasy from the mere fact of existence,\nand all the thousand and one forms of insect life that flew and crawled,\nand swam and dived, showed themselves to the tribesmen on the raft.\n\nWater-beetles came lazily to the surface, to snap with sudden energy at\nmosquitoes busily laying their eggs in the nearly stagnant water by the\nriver-banks. Burl pointed out to Saya, with some excitement, their\nsilver breast-plates that shone as they darted under the water again.\nAnd the shell-covered boats of a thousand caddis-worms floated in the\neddies and back-waters of the stream. Water-boatmen and\nwhirligigs--almost alone among insects in not having shared in the\ngeneral increase of size--danced upon the oily waves.\n\nThe day wore on as the shores flowed by. The tribefolk ate of their\nburdens of mushroom and meat, and drank from the fresh water of the\nriver. Then, when afternoon came, the character of the country about the\nstream changed. The banks fell away, and the current slackened. The\nshores became indefinite, and the river merged itself into a swamp, a\nvast swamp from which a continual muttering came which the tribesmen\nheard for a long time before they saw the swamp itself.\n\nThe water seemed to turn dark, as black mud took the place of the clay\nthat had formed its bed, and slowly, here and there, then more\nfrequently, floating green things that were stationary, and did not move\nwith the current, appeared. They were the leaves of water-lilies, that\nhad remained with the giant cabbages and a very few other plants in the\nmidst of a fungoid world. The green leaves were twelve feet across, and\nany one of them would have floated the whole of Burl's tribe.\n\nPresently they grew numerous so that the channel was made narrow, and\nthe mushroom rafts passed between rows of the great leaves, with here\nand there a colossal, waxen blossom in which three men might have hidden\nand which exhaled an almost over-powering fragrance into the air.\n\nAnd the muttering that had been heard far away grew in volume to an\nintermittent, incredibly deep bass roar. It seemed to come from the\nbanks on either side, and actually was the discordant croaking of the\ngiant frogs, grown to eight feet in length, which lived and loved in the\nhuge swamp, above which golden butterflies danced in ecstasy, and which\nthe transcendently beautiful blossoms of the water-lilies filled with\nfragrance.\n\nThe swamp was a place of riotous life. The green bodies of the colossal\nfrogs--perched upon the banks in strange immobility and only opening\ntheir huge mouths to emit their thunderous croakings--the green bodies\nof the frogs blended queerly with the vivid color of the water-lily\nleaves. Dragon-flies fluttered in their swift and angular flight above\nthe black and reeking mud. Green-bottles and blue-bottles and a hundred\nother species of flies buzzed busily in the misty air, now and then\nfalling prey to the licking tongues of the frogs.\n\nBees droned overhead in flight less preoccupied and worried than\nelsewhere flitting from blossom to blossom of the tremendous\nwater-lilies, loading their crops with honey and the bristles of their\nlegs with yellow pollen.\n\nEverywhere over the mushroom-covered world the air was never quite free\nfrom mist, and the steaming exhalations of the pools, but here in the\nswamps the atmosphere was so heavily laden with moisture that the bodies\nof the tribefolk were covered with glistening droplets, while the wide,\nflat water-lily leaves glittered like platters of jewels from the\n\"steam\" that had condensed upon their upper surfaces.\n\nThe air was full of shining bodies and iridescent wings. Myriads of tiny\nmidges--no more than three or four inches across their wings--danced\nabove the slow-flowing water. And butterflies of every imaginable shade\nand color, from the most delicate lavender to the most vivid carmine,\ndanced and fluttered, alighting upon the white water-lilies to sip\ndaintily of their nectar, skimming the surface of the water, enamored of\ntheir brightly tinted reflections.\n\nAnd the pink-skinned tribesfolk, floating through this fairyland on\ntheir mushroom rafts, gazed with wide eyes at the beauty about them, and\ndrew in great breaths of the intoxicating fragrance of the great white\nflowers that floated like elfin boats upon the dark water.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nOut of Bondage\n\n\nThe mist was heavy and thick, and through it the flying creatures darted\nupon their innumerable businesses, visible for an instant in all their\ncolorful beauty, then melting slowly into indefiniteness as they sped\naway. The tribefolk on the clustered rafts watched them as they darted\noverhead, and for hours the little squadron of fungoid vessels floated\nslowly through the central channel of the marsh.\n\nThe river had split into innumerable currents which meandered\npurposelessly through the glistening black mud of the swamp, but after a\nlong time they seemed to reassemble, and Burl could see what had caused\nthe vast morass.\n\nHills appeared on either side of the stream, which grew higher and\nsteeper, as if the foothills of a mountain chain. Then Burl turned and\npeered before him.\n\nRising straight from the low hills, a wall of high mountains rose toward\nthe sky, and the low-hanging clouds met their rugged flanks but half-way\ntoward the peaks. To right and left the mountains melted into the\ntenuous haze, but ahead they were firm and stalwart, rising and losing\ntheir heights in the cloud-banks.\n\nThey formed a rampart which might have guarded the edge of the world,\nand the river flowed more and more rapidly in a deeper and narrower\ncurrent toward a cleft between two rugged giants that promised to\nswallow the water and all that might swim in its depths or float upon\nits surface.\n\nTall, steep hills rose from either side of the swift current, their\nsides covered with flaking molds of an exotic shade of rose-pink,\nmingled here and there with lavender and purple. Rocks, not hidden\nbeneath a coating of fungus, protruded their angular heads from the\nhillsides. The river valley became a gorge, and then little more than a\nca\u00f1on, with beetling sides that frowned down upon the swift current\nrunning beneath them.\n\nThe small flotilla passed beneath an overhanging cliff, and then shot\nout to where the cliffsides drew apart and formed a deep amphitheater,\nwhose top was hidden in the clouds.\n\nAnd across this open space, on cables all of five hundred feet long, a\nbanded spider had flung its web. It was a monster of its tribe. Its\nbelly was swollen to a diameter of no less than two yards, and its\noutstretched legs would have touched eight points of a ten-yard circle.\n\nIt was hanging motionless in the center of the colossal snare as the\nlittle group of tribefolk passed underneath, and they saw the broad\nbands of yellow and black and silver upon its abdomen. They shivered as\ntheir little crafts were swept below.\n\nThen they came to a little valley, where yellow sand bordered the river\nand there was a level space of a hundred yards on either side before the\nsteep sides of the mountains began their rise. Here the cluster of\nmushroom rafts were caught in a little eddy and drawn out of the swiftly\nflowing current. Soon there was a soft and yielding jar. The rafts had\ngrounded.\n\nLed by Burl, the tribesmen waded ashore, wonderment and excitement in\ntheir hearts. Burl searched all about with his eyes. Toadstools and\nmushrooms, rusts and molds, even giant puff-balls grew in the little\nvalley, but of the deadly red mushrooms he saw none.\n\nA single bee was buzzing slowly over the tangled thickets of fungoids,\nand the loud voice of a cricket came in a deafening burst of sound,\nreechoed from the hillsides, but save for the far-flung web of the\nbanded spider a mile or more away, there was no sign of the deadly\ncreatures that preyed upon men.\n\nBurl began to climb the hillside with his tribefolk after him. For an\nhour they toiled upward, through confused masses of fungus of almost\nevery species. Twice they stopped to seize upon edible fungi and break\nthem into masses they could carry, and once they paused and made a wide\ndetour around a thicket from which there came a stealthy rustling.\n\nBurl believed that the rustling was merely the sound of a moth or\nbutterfly emerging from its chrysalis, but was unwilling to take any\nchances. He and his people circled the mushroom thicket and mounted\nhigher.\n\nAnd at last, perhaps six or seven hundred feet above the level of the\nriver, they came upon a little plateau, going back into a small pocket\nin the mountainside. Here they found many of the edible fungoids, and no\nless than a dozen of the giant cabbages, on whose broad leaves many\nfurry grubs were feeding steadily in placid contentment with themselves\nand all the world.\n\nA small stream bubbled up from a tiny basin and ran swiftly across the\nplateau, and there were dense thickets of toadstools in which the\ntribesmen might find secure hiding-places. The tribe would make itself a\nnew home here.\n\nThat night they hid among inextricably tangled masses of mushrooms, and\nsaw with amazement the multitude of creatures that ventured forth in the\ndarkness. All the valley and the plateau were illumined by the shining\nbeacons of huge but graceful fireflies, who darted here and there in\ndelight and--apparently--in security.\n\nUpon the earth below, also, many tiny lights glowed. The larv\u00e6 of the\nfireflies crawled slowly but happily over the fungus-covered\nmountainside, and great glow-worms clambered upon the shining tops of\nthe toadstools and rested there, twin broad bands of bluish fire burning\nbrightly within their translucent bodies.\n\nThey were the females of the firefly race, which never attain to legs\nand wings, but crawl always upon the earth, merely enlarged creatures in\nthe forms of their own larv\u00e6. Moths soared overhead with mighty,\nthrobbing wing-beats, and all the world seemed a paradise through which\nno evil creatures roamed in search of prey.\n\nAnd a strange thing came to pass. Soon after darkness fell upon the\nearth and the steady drip-drop of the rain began, a musical tinkling\nsound was heard which grew in volume, and became a deep-toned roar,\nwhich reechoed and reverberated from the opposite hillsides until it was\nlike melodious and long-continued thunder. For a long time the people\nwere puzzled and a little afraid, but Burl took courage and\ninvestigated.\n\nHe emerged from the concealing thicket and peered cautiously about,\nseeing nothing. Then he dared move in the direction of the sound, and\nthe gleam from a dozen fireflies showed him a sheet of water pouring\nover a vertical cliff to the river far below.\n\nThe rainfall, gentle as it was, when gathered from all the broad expanse\nof the mountainside, made a river of its own, which had scoured out a\nbed, and poured down each night to plunge in a smother of spray and foam\nthrough six hundred feet of empty space to the swiftly flowing river in\nthe center of the valley. It was this sound that had puzzled the\ntribefolk, and this sound that lulled them to sleep when Burl at last\ncame back to allay their fears.\n\nThe next day they explored their new territory with a boldness of which\nthey would not have been capable a month before. They found a single\ngreat trap-door in the earth, sure sign of the burrow of a monster\nspider, and Burl resolved that before many days the spider would be\ndealt with. He told his tribesmen so, and they nodded their heads\nsolemnly instead of shrinking back in terror as they would have done not\nlong since.\n\nThe tribe was rapidly becoming a group of men, capable of taking the\naggressive. They needed Burl's rash leadership, and for many generations\nthey would need bold leaders, but they were infinitely superior to the\ntimid, rabbit-like creatures they had been. They bore spears, and they\nhad used them. They had seen danger, and had blindly followed Burl\nthrough the forest of strangled things instead of fleeing weakly from\nthe peril.\n\nThey wore soft, yellow fur about their middles, taken from the bodies of\ngiant slugs they had slain. They had eaten much meat, and preferred its\nsucculent taste to the insipid savor of the mushrooms that had once been\ntheir steady diet. They knew the exhilaration of brave adventure--though\nthey had been forced into adventure by Burl--and they were far more\nworthy descendants of their ancestors than those ancestors had known for\nmany thousand years.\n\nThe exploration of their new domain yielded many wonders and a few\nadvantages. The tribefolk found that the nearest ant-city was miles\naway, and that the small insects would trouble them but rarely. (The\nnightly rush of water down the sloping sides of the mountain made it\nundesirable for the site of an ant colony.)\n\nAnd best of all, back in the little pocket in the mountainside, they\nfound old and disused cells of hunting wasps. The walls of the pocket\nwere made of soft sandstone with alternate layers of clay, and the wasps\nhad found digging easy.\n\nThere were a dozen or more burrows, the shaft of each some four feet in\ndiameter and going back into the cliff for nearly thirty feet, where\nthey branched out into a number of cells. Each of the cells had once\nheld a grub which had grown fat and large upon its hoard of paralyzed\ncrickets, and then had broken away to the outer world to emerge as a\nfull-grown wasp.\n\nNow, however, the laboriously tunneled caverns would furnish a\nhiding-place for the tribe of men, a far more secure hiding-place than\nthe center of the mushroom thickets. And, furthermore, a hiding-place\nwhich, because more permanent, would gradually become a possession for\nwhich the men would fight.\n\nIt is a curious thing that the advancement of a people from a state of\nsavagery and continual warfare to civilization and continual peace is\nnot made by the elimination of the causes of strife, but by the addition\nof new objects and ideals, in defense of which that same people will\noffer battle.\n\nA single chrysalis was found securely anchored to the underside of a\nrock-shelf, and Burl detached it with great labor and carried it into\none of the burrows, though the task was one that was almost beyond his\nstrength. He desired the butterfly that would emerge for his own use.\n\nHe preempted, too, a solitary burrow a little distant from the others,\nand made preparations for an event that was destined to make his plans\nwiser and more far-reaching than before.\n\nHis followers were equally busy with their various burrows, gathering\nstores of soft growth for their couches, and later--at Burl's\nsuggestion--even carrying within the dark caverns the radiant heads of\nthe luminous mushrooms to furnish illumination. The light would be dim,\nand after the mushroom had partly dried it would cease, but for a people\nutterly ignorant of fire it was far from a bad plan.\n\nBurl was very happy for that time. His people looked upon him as a\nsavior, and obeyed his least order without question. He was growing to\nrepose some measure of trust in them, too, as men who began to have some\nglimmerings of the new-found courage that had come to him, and which he\nhad striven hard to implant in their breasts.\n\nThe tribe had been a formless gathering of people. There were six or\nseven men and as many women, and naturally families had come into\nbeing--sometimes after fierce and absurd fights among the men--but the\nfamilies were not the sharply distinct agreements they would have been\nin a tribe of higher development.\n\nThe marriage was but an agreement, terminable at any time, and the men\nhad but little of the feeling of parenthood, though the women had all\nthe fierce maternal instinct of the insects about them.\n\nThese burrows in which the tribefolk were making their homes would put\nan end to the casual nature of the marriage bonds. They were homes in\nthe making--damp and humid burrows without fire or heat, but homes,\nnevertheless. The family may come before the home, in the development of\nmankind, but it invariably exists when the home has been made.\n\nThe tribe had been upon the plateau for nearly a week when Burl found\nthat stirrings and strugglings were going on within the huge cocoon he\nhad laid close beside the burrow he had chosen for his own. He cast\naside all other work, and waited patiently for the thing he knew was\nabout to happen. He squatted on his haunches beside the huge, oblong\ncylinder, his spear in his hand, waiting patiently. From time to time he\nnibbled at a bit of edible mushroom.\n\nBurl had acquired many new traits, among which a little foresight was\nmost prominent, but he had never conquered the habit of feeling hungry\nat any and every time that food was near at hand. He had to wait. He had\nfood. Therefore, he ate.\n\nThe sound of scrapings came from the closed cocoon, caked upon its outer\nside with dirt and mold. The scraping and scratching continued, and\npresently a tiny hole showed, which rapidly enlarged. Tiny jaws and a\ndry, glazed skin became visible, the skin looking as if it had been\nvarnished with many coats of brown shellac. Then a malformed head forced\nits way through and stopped.\n\nAll motion ceased for a matter of perhaps half an hour, and then the\nstrange, blind head seemed to become distended, to be swelling. A crack\nappeared along its upper part, which lengthened and grew wide. And then\na second head appeared from within the first.\n\nThis head was soft and downy, and a slender proboscis was coiled beneath\nits lower edge like the trunk of one of the elephants that had been\nextinct for many thousand years. Soft scales and fine hairs alternated\nto cover it, and two immense, many-faceted eyes gazed mildly at the\nworld on which it was looking for the first time. The color of the whole\nwas purest milky-white.\n\nSlowly and painfully, assisting itself by slender, colorless legs that\nseemed strangely feeble and trembling, a butterfly crawled from the\ncocoon. Its wings were folded and lifeless, without substance or color,\nbut the body was a perfect white. The butterfly moved a little distance\nfrom its cocoon and slowly unfurled its wings. With the action, life\nseemed to be pumped into them from some hidden spring in the insect's\nbody. The slender antenn\u00e6 spread out and wavered gently in the warm air.\nThe wings were becoming broad expanses of snowy velvet.\n\nA trace of eagerness seemed to come into the butterfly's actions.\nSomewhere there in the valley sweet food and joyous companions awaited\nit. Fluttering above the fungoids of the hillsides, surely there was a\nmate with whom the joys of love were to be shared, surely upon those\ngigantic patches of green, half hidden in the haze, there would be laid\ntiny golden eggs that in time would hatch into small, fat grubs.\n\nStrength came to the butterfly's limbs. Its wings were spread and\nclosed with a new assurance. It spread them once more, and raised them\nto make the first flight of this new existence in a marvelous world,\nfull of delights and adventures--Burl struck home with his spear.\n\nThe delicate limbs struggled in agony, the wings fluttered helplessly,\nand in a little while the butterfly lay still upon the fungus-carpeted\nearth, and Burl leaned over to strip away the great wings of snow-white\nvelvet, to sever the long and slender antenn\u00e6, and then to call his\ntribesmen and bid them share in the food he had for them.\n\nAnd there was a feast that afternoon. The tribesmen sat about the white\ncarcass, cracking open the delicate limbs for the meat within them, and\nBurl made sure that Saya secured the choicest bits. The tribesmen were\nhappy. Then one of the children of the tribe stretched a hand aloft and\npointed up the mountainside.\n\nComing slowly down the slanting earth was a long, narrow file of living\nanimals. For a time the file seemed to be but one creature, but Burl's\nkeen eyes soon saw that there were many. They were caterpillars, each\none perhaps ten feet long, each with a tiny black head armed with sharp\njaws, and with dull-red fur upon their backs. The rear of the procession\nwas lost in the mist of the low-hanging cloud-banks that covered the\nmountainside some two thousand feet above the plateau, but the foremost\nwas no more than three hundred yards away.\n\nSlowly and solemnly the procession came on, the black head of the second\ntouching the rear of the first, and the head of the third touching the\nrear of the second. In faultless alignment, without intervals, they\nmoved steadily down the slanting side of the mountain.\n\nSave the first, they seemed absorbed in maintaining their perfect\nformation, but the leader constantly rose upon his hinder half and waved\nthe fore part of his body in the air, first to the right and then to the\nleft, as if searching out the path he would follow.\n\nThe tribefolk watched in amazement mingled with terror. Only Burl was\ncalm. He had never seen a slug that meant danger to man, and he reasoned\nthat these were at any rate moving slowly so that they could be\ndistanced by the fleeter-footed human beings, but he also meant to be\ncautious.\n\nThe slow march kept on. The rear of the procession of caterpillars\nemerged from the cloud-bank, and Burl saw that a shining white line was\nleft behind them. No less than eighty great caterpillars clad in white\nand dingy red were solemnly moving down the mountainside, leaving a path\nof shining silk behind them. Head to tail, in single file, they had no\neyes or ears for anything but their procession.\n\nThe leader reached the plateau, and turned. He came to the cluster of\ngiant cabbages, and ignored them. He came to a thicket of mushrooms, and\npassed through it, followed by his devoted band. Then he came to an open\nspace where the earth was soft and sandy, where sandstone had weathered\nand made a great heap of easily moved earth.\n\nThe leading caterpillar halted, and began to burrow experimentally in\nthe ground. The result pleased him, and some signal seemed to pass\nalong the eight-hundred-foot line of creatures. The leader began to dig\nwith feet and jaws, working furiously to cover himself completely with\nthe soft earth. Those immediately behind him abandoned their formation,\nand pressed forward in haste. Those still farther back moved more\nhurriedly.\n\nAll, when they reached the spot selected by the leader, abandoned any\nattempt to keep to their line, and hastened to find an unoccupied spot\nin the open space in which to bury themselves.\n\nFor perhaps half an hour the clearing was the scene of intense activity,\nincredible activity. Huge, ten-foot bodies burrowed desperately in the\nwhitish earth, digging frantically to cover themselves.\n\nAfter the half-hour, however, the last of the caterpillars had vanished.\nOnly an occasional movement of the earth from the struggle of a buried\ncreature to bury itself still deeper, and the freshly turned surface\nshowed that beneath the clearing on the plateau eighty great slugs were\npreparing themselves for the sleep of metamorphosis. The piled-up earth\nand the broad, white band of silk, leading back up the hillside until it\nbecame lost in the clouds, alone remained to tell of the visitation.\n\nThe tribesmen had watched in amazement. They had never seen these\ncreatures before, but they knew, of course, why they had entombed\nthemselves. Had they known what the scientists of thirty thousand years\nbefore had written in weighty and dull books, they would have deduced\nfrom the appearance of the processionary caterpillars--or\npine-caterpillars--that somewhere above the banks of clouds there were\ngrowing trees and sunlight, that a moon shone down, and stars twinkled\nfrom the blue vault of a cloudless sky.\n\nBut the tribesmen did not know. They only knew that there, beneath the\nsoft earth, was a mighty store of food for them when they cared to dig\nfor it, that their provisions for many months were secure, and that\nBurl, their leader, was a great and mighty man for having led them to\nthis land of safety and plenty.\n\nBurl read their emotions in their eyes, but better than their amazement\nand wonderment was a glance that had nothing whatever to do with his\nleadership of the tribe. And then Burl rose, and took the two\nsnowy-white velvet cloaks from the wings of the white butterfly. One of\nthem he flung about his own shoulders, and the other he flung about\nSaya. And then those two stood up before the wide-eyed tribesmen, and\nBurl spoke:\n\n\"This is my mate, and my food is her food, and her wrath is my wrath. My\nburrow is her burrow, and her sorrow, my sorrow.\n\n\"Men whom I have led to this land of plenty, hear me. As ye obey my\nwords, see to it that the words of Saya are obeyed likewise, for my\nspear will loose the life from any man who angers her. Know that as I am\ngreat beyond all other men, so Saya is great beyond all other women, for\nI say it, and it is so.\"\n\nAnd he drew Saya toward him, trembling slightly, and put his arm about\nher waist before all the tribe, and the tribesmen muttered in\nacquiescent whispers that what Burl said was true, as they had already\nknown.\n\nThen, while the pink-skinned men feasted on the meat Burl had provided\nfor them, he and Saya went toward the burrow he had made ready. It was\nnot like the other burrows, being set apart from them, and its entrance\nwas bordered on either side by mushrooms as black as night. All about\nthe entrance the black mushrooms clustered, a strange species that grew\nlarge and scattered its spores abroad and then of its own accord melted\ninto an inky liquid that flowed away, sinking slowly into the ground.\n\nIn a little hollow below the opening of the burrow an inky pool had\ngathered, which reflected the gray clouds above and the shapes of the\nmushrooms that overhung its edges.\n\nBurl and Saya made their way toward the burrow in silence, a picturesque\ncouple against the black background of the sable mushrooms and the earth\nmade dark by the inky liquid. Both of their figures were swathed in\ncloaks of unsmirched whiteness and wondrous softness, and bound to\nBurl's forehead were the feathery, lacelike antenna of a great moth,\nmaking flowing plumes of purest gold. His spear seemed cast from\nbronze, and he was a proud figure as he led Saya past the black pool and\nto the doorway of their home.\n\nThey sat there, watching, while the darkness came on and the moths and\nfireflies emerged to dance in the night, and listened when the rain\nbegan its slow, deliberate dripping from the heavy clouds above.\nPresently a gentle rumbling began--the accumulation of the rain from all\nthe mountainside forming a torrent that would pour in a six-hundred-foot\ndrop to the river far below.\n\nThe sound of the rushing water grew louder, and was echoed back from the\ncliffs on the other side of the valley. The fireflies danced like fairy\nlights in the chasm, and all the creatures of the night winged their way\naloft to join in the ecstasy of life and love.\n\nAnd then, when darkness was complete, and only the fitful gleams of the\nhuge fireflies were reflected from the still surface of the black pool\nbeneath their feet, Burl reached out his hand to Saya, sitting beside\nhim in the darkness. She yielded shyly, and her soft, warm hand found\nhis in the obscurity. And Burl bent over and kissed her on the lips.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Red Dust, by Murray Leinster\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RED DUST ***\n\n***** This file should be named 41586-8.txt or 41586-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/1/5/8/41586/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
