He was tired; I don't think I've ever seen Lambertson so\ntired. It was more than just exhaustion, too. Maybe anger? Frustration?\nI couldn't be sure. It seemed more like _defeat_ than anything else, and\nhe went straight from the 'copter to his office without even stopping\noff at the lab at all.\n\nIt's good to have him back, though! Not that I haven't had a nice enough\nrest. With Lambertson gone, Dakin took over the reins for the week, but\nDakin doesn't really count, poor man. It's such a temptation to twist\nhim up and get him all confused that I didn't do any real _work_ all\nweek. With Lambertson back I'll have to get down to the grind again, but\nI'm still glad he's here. I never thought I'd miss him so, for such a\nshort time away.\n\nBut I wish he'd gotten a rest, if he ever rests! And I wish I knew why\nhe went to Boston in the first place. Certainly he didn't _want_ to go.\nI wanted to read him and find out, but I don't think I'm supposed to\nknow yet. Lambertson didn't want to talk. He didn't even tell me he was\nback, even though he knew I'd catch him five miles down the road. (I can\ndo that now, with Lambertson. Distance doesn't seem to make so much\ndifference any more if I just ignore it.)\n\nSo all I got was bits and snatches on the surface of his mind. Something\nabout me, and Dr. Custer; and a nasty little man called Aarons or\nBarrons or something. I've heard of him somewhere, but I can't pin it\ndown right now. I'll have to dig that out later, I guess.\n\nBut if he saw Dr. Custer, _why doesn't he tell me about it_?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Wednesday, 17 May._ It was _Aarons_ that he saw in Boston, and now I'm\nsure that something's going wrong. I know that man. I remember him from\na long time ago, back when I was still at Bairdsley, long before I came\nhere to the Study Center. He was the consulting psychiatrist, and I\ndon't think I could ever forget him, even if I tried!\n\nThat's why I'm sure something very unpleasant is going on.\n\nLambertson saw Dr. Custer, too, but the directors sent him to Boston\nbecause Aarons wanted to talk to him. I wasn't supposed to know anything\nabout it, but Lambertson came down to dinner last night. He wouldn't\neven look at me, the skunk. I fixed _him_. I told him I was going to\npeek, and then I read him in a flash, before he could shift his mind to\nBoston traffic or something. (He knows I can't stand traffic.)\n\nI only picked up a little, but it was enough. There was something very\nunpleasant that Aarons had said that I couldn't quite get. They were in\nhis office. Lambertson had said, \"I don't think she's ready for it, and\nI'd never try to talk her into it, at this point. Why can't you people\nget it through your heads that she's a _child_, and a human being, not\nsome kind of laboratory animal? That's been the trouble all along.\nEverybody has been so eager to _grab_, and nobody has given her a\nwretched thing in return.\"\n\nAarons was smooth. Very sad and reproachful. I got a clear picture of\nhim--short, balding, mean little eyes in a smug, self-righteous little\nface. \"Michael, after all she's twenty-three years old. She's certainly\nout of diapers by now.\"\n\n\"But she's only had two years of training aimed at teaching _her_\nanything.\"\n\n\"Well, there's no reason that _that_ should stop, is there? Be\nreasonable, Michael. We certainly agree that you've done a wonderful job\nwith the girl, and naturally you're sensitive about others working with\nher. But when you consider that public taxes are footing the bill--\"\n\n\"I'm sensitive about others exploiting her, that's all. I tell you, I\nwon't push her. And I wouldn't let her come up here, even if she agreed\nto do it. She shouldn't be tampered with for another year or two at\nleast.\" Lambertson was angry and bitter. Now, three days later, he was\nstill angry.\n\n\"And you're certain that your concern is entirely--professional?\"\n(Whatever Aarons meant, it wasn't nice. Lambertson caught it, and oh,\nmy! Chart slapping down on the table, door slamming, swearing--from\nmild, patient Lambertson, can you imagine? And then later, no more\nanger, just disgust and defeat. That was what hit me when he came back\nyesterday. He couldn't hide it, no matter how he tried.)\n\nWell, no wonder he was tired. I remember Aarons all right. He wasn't so\ninterested in me, back in those days. _Wild one_, he called me. _We\nhaven't the time or the people to handle anything like this in a public\ninstitution. We have to handle her the way we'd handle any other\ndefective. She may be a_ plus_-defective instead of a_ minus_-defective,\nbut she's as crippled as if she were deaf and blind._\n\nGood old Aarons. That was years ago, when I was barely thirteen. Before\nDr. Custer got interested and started ophthalmoscoping me and testing\nme, before I'd ever heard of Lambertson or the Study Center. For that\nmatter, before anybody had done anything but feed me and treat me like\nsome kind of peculiar animal or something.\n\nWell, I'm glad it was Lambertson that went to Boston and not me, for\nAarons' sake. And if Aarons tries to come down here to work with me,\nhe's going to be wasting his time, because I'll lead him all around\nRobin Hood's Barn and get him so confused he'll wish he'd stayed home.\nBut I can't help but wonder, just the same. _Am_ I a cripple like Aarons\nsaid? Does being psi-high mean that? _I_ don't think so, but what does\nLambertson think? Sometimes when I try to read Lambertson I'm the one\nthat gets confused. I wish I could tell what he _really_ thinks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Wednesday night._ I asked Lambertson tonight what Dr. Custer had said.\n\"He wants to see you next week,\" he told me. \"But Amy, he didn't make\nany promises. He wasn't even hopeful.\"\n\n\"But his letter! He said the studies showed that there wasn't any\nanatomical defect.\"\n\nLambertson leaned back and lit his pipe, shaking his head at me. He's\naged ten years this past week. Everybody thinks so. He's lost weight,\nand he looks as if he hasn't slept at all. \"Custer's afraid that it\nisn't a question of anatomy, Amy.\"\n\n\"But what is it, then, for heaven's sake?\"\n\n\"He doesn't know. He says it's not very scientific, but it may just be\nthat what you don't use, you lose.\"\n\n\"Oh, but that's silly.\" I chewed my lip.\n\n\"Granted.\"\n\n\"But he thinks that there's a chance?\"\n\n\"Of course there's a chance. And you know he'll do everything he can.\nIt's just that neither of us wants you to get your hopes up.\"\n\nIt wasn't much, but it was something. Lambertson looked so beat. I\ndidn't have the heart to ask him what Aarons wanted, even though I know\nhe'd like to get it off his chest. Maybe tomorrow will be better.\n\nI spent the day with Charlie Dakin in the lab, and did a little work for\na change. I've been disgustingly lazy, and poor Charlie thinks it's all\nhis fault. Charlie reads like twenty-point type ninety per cent of the\ntime, and I'm afraid he knows it. I can tell just exactly when he stops\npaying attention to business and starts paying attention to _me_, and\nthen all of a sudden he realizes I'm reading him, and it flusters him\nfor the rest of the day. I wonder why? Does he really think I'm shocked?\nOr surprised? Or _insulted_? Poor Charlie!\n\nI guess I must be good enough looking. I can read it from almost every\nfellow that comes near me. I wonder why? I mean, why me and not Marjorie\nover in the Main Office? She's a sweet girl, but she never gets a second\nlook from the guys. There must be some fine differential point I'm\nmissing somewhere, but I don't think I'll ever understand it.\n\nI'm not going to press Lambertson, but I _hope_ he opens up tomorrow.\nHe's got me scared silly by now. He has a lot of authority around here,\nbut other people are paying the bills, and when he's frightened about\nsomething, it can't help but frighten me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Thursday, 18 May._ We went back to reaction testing in the lab with\nLambertson today. That study is almost finished, as much as anything I\nwork on is ever finished, which isn't very much. This test had two\ngoals: to clock my stimulus-response pattern in comparison to normals,\nand to find out just exactly _when_ I pick up any given thought-signal\nfrom the person I'm reading. It isn't a matter of developing speed. I'm\nalready so fast to respond that it doesn't mean too much from anybody\nelse's standpoint, and I certainly don't need any training there. But\nwhere along the line do I pick up a thought impulse? Do I catch it at\nits inception? Do I pick up the thought formulation, or just the final\ncrystalized pattern? Lambertson thinks I'm with it right from the start,\nand that some training in those lines would be worth my time.\n\nOf course, we didn't find out, not even with the ingenious little\nrandom-firing device that Dakin designed for the study. With this\ngadget, neither Lambertson nor I know what impulse the box is going to\nthrow at him. He just throws a switch and it starts coming. He catches\nit, reacts, I catch it from him and react, and we compare reaction\ntimes. This afternoon it had us driving up a hill, and sent a ten-ton\ntruck rolling down on us out of control. I had my flasher on two seconds\nbefore Lambertson did, of course, but our reaction times are\nstandardized, so when we corrected for my extra speed, we knew that I\nmust have caught the impulse about 0.07 seconds after he did.\n\nCrude, of course, not nearly fast enough, and we can't reproduce on a\nstable basis. Lambertson says that's as close as we can get without\ncortical probes. And that's where I put my foot down. I may have a gold\nmine in this head of mine, but nobody is going to put burr-holes through\nmy skull in order to tap it. Not for a while yet.\n\nThat's unfair, of course, because it sounds as if Lambertson were trying\nto force me into something, and he isn't. I've read him about that, and\nI know he wouldn't allow it. _Let's learn everything else we can learn\nwithout it first_, he says. _Later, if you want to go along with it,\nmaybe. But right now you're not competent to decide for yourself._\n\nHe may be right, but why not? Why does he keep acting as if I'm a child?\n_Am_ I, really? With everything (and I mean _everything_) coming into my\nmind for the past twenty-three years, haven't I learned enough to make\ndecisions for myself? Lambertson says of course everything has been\ncoming in, it's just that I don't know what to do with it all. But\nsomewhere along the line I have to reach a maturation point of some\nkind.\n\nIt scares me, sometimes, because I can't find an answer to it and the\nanswer might be perfectly horrible. I don't know where it may end.\nWhat's worse, I don't know what point it has reached _right now_. How\nmuch difference is there between my mind and Lambertson's? I'm psi-high,\nand he isn't--granted. But is there more to it than that? People like\nAarons think so. They think it's a difference between _human_ function\nand something else.\n\nAnd that scares me because it _just isn't true_. I'm as human as anybody\nelse. But somehow it seems that I'm the one who has to prove it. I\nwonder if I ever will. That's why Dr. Custer has to help me. Everything\nhangs on that. I'm to go up to Boston next week, for final studies and\ntesting.\n\nIf Dr. Custer can do something, what a difference that will make! Maybe\nthen I could get out of this whole frightening mess, put it behind me\nand forget about it. With just the psi alone, I don't think I ever can.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Friday, 19 May._ Today Lambertson broke down and told me what it was\nthat Aarons had been proposing. It was worse than I thought it would be.\nThe man had hit on the one thing I'd been afraid of for so long.\n\n\"He wants you to work against normals,\" Lambertson said. \"He's swallowed\nthe latency hypothesis whole. He thinks that everybody must have a\nlatent psi potential, and that all that is needed to drag it into the\nopen is a powerful stimulus from someone with full-blown psi powers.\"\n\n\"Well?\" I said. \"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" Lambertson slammed his pencil down on the desk angrily.\n\"No, I don't think so, but what does that mean? Not a thing. It\ncertainly doesn't mean I'm right. Nobody knows the answer, not me, nor\nAarons, nor anybody. And Aarons wants to use you to find out.\"\n\nI nodded slowly. \"I see. So I'm to be used as a sort of refined\nelectrical stimulator,\" I said. \"Well, I guess you know what you can\ntell Aarons.\"\n\nHe was silent, and I couldn't read him. Then he looked up. \"Amy, I'm not\nsure we can tell him that.\"\n\nI stared at him. \"You mean you think he could _force_ me?\"\n\n\"He says you're a public charge, that as long as you have to be\nsupported and cared for, they have the right to use your faculties. He's\nright on the first point. You _are_ a public charge. You have to be\nsheltered and protected. If you wandered so much as a mile outside these\nwalls you'd never survive, and you know it.\"\n\nI sat stunned. \"But Dr. Custer--\"\n\n\"Dr. Custer is trying to help. But he hasn't succeeded so far. If he\ncan, then it will be a different story. But I can't stall much longer,\nAmy. Aarons has a powerful argument. You're psi-high. You're the first\nfull-fledged, wide-open, free-wheeling psi-high that's ever appeared in\nhuman history. The _first_. Others in the past have shown potential,\nmaybe, but nothing they could ever learn to control. You've got control,\nyou're fully developed. You're _here_, and you're _the only one there\nis_.\"\n\n\"So I happened to be unlucky,\" I snapped. \"My genes got mixed up.\"\n\n\"That's not true, and you know it,\" Lambertson said. \"We know your\nchromosomes better than your face. They're the same as anyone else's.\nThere's no gene difference, none at all. When you're gone, you'll be\n_gone_, and there's no reason to think that your children will have any\nmore psi potential than Charlie Dakin has.\"\n\nSomething was building up in me then that I couldn't control any longer.\n\"You think I should go along with Aarons,\" I said dully.\n\nHe hesitated. \"I'm afraid you're going to have to, sooner or later.\nAarons has some latents up in Boston. He's certain that they're latents.\nHe's talked to the directors down here. He's convinced them that you\ncould work with his people, draw them out. You could open the door to a\nwhole new world for human beings.\"\n\nI lost my temper then. It wasn't just Aarons, or Lambertson, or Dakin,\nor any of the others. It was _all_ of them, dozens of them, compounded\nyear upon year upon year. \"Now listen to me for a minute,\" I said. \"Have\nany of you ever considered what _I_ wanted in this thing? _Ever?_ Have\nany of you given that one single thought, just once, one time when you\nwere so sick of thinking great thoughts for humanity that you let\nanother thought leak through? Have you ever thought about what kind of a\nshuffle I've had since all this started? Well, you'd better think about\nit. _Right now._\"\n\n\"Amy, you know I don't want to push you.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Lambertson. My folks got rid of me fast when they found\nout about me. Did you know that? They hated me because I _scared_ them!\nIt didn't hurt me too much, because I thought I knew _why_ they hated\nme, I could understand it, and I went off to Bairdsley without even\ncrying. They were going to come see me every week, but do you know how\noften they managed to make it? _Not once_ after I was off their hands.\nAnd then at Bairdsley Aarons examined me and decided that I was a\ncripple. He didn't know anything about me then, but he thought psi was a\n_defect_. And that was as far as it went. I did what Aarons wanted me to\ndo at Bairdsley. Never what _I_ wanted, just what _they_ wanted, years\nand years of what _they_ wanted. And then you came along, and I came to\nthe Study Center and did what _you_ wanted.\"\n\nIt hurt him, and I knew it. I guess that was what I wanted, to hurt him\nand to hurt everybody. He was shaking his head, staring at me. \"Amy, be\nfair. I've tried, you know how hard I've tried.\"\n\n\"Tried what? To train me? Yes, but why? To give me better use of my psi\nfaculties? Yes, but why? Did you do it for _me_? Is that really why you\ndid it? Or was that just another phoney front, like all the rest of\nthem, in order to use me, to make me a little more valuable to have\naround?\"\n\nHe slapped my face so hard it jolted me. I could feel the awful pain and\nhurt in his mind as he stared at me, and I sensed the stinging in his\npalm that matched the burning in my cheek. And then something fell away\nin his mind, and I saw something I had never seen before.\n\nHe loved me, that man. Incredible, isn't it? He _loved_ me. Me, who\ncouldn't call him anything but Lambertson, who couldn't imagine calling\nhim Michael, to say nothing of Mike--just Lambertson, who did this, or\nLambertson who thought that.\n\nBut he could never tell me. He had decided that. I was too helpless. I\nneeded him too much. I needed love, but not the kind of love Lambertson\nwanted to give, so that kind of love had to be hidden, concealed,\n_suppressed_. I needed the deepest imaginable understanding, but it had\nto be utterly unselfish understanding, anything else would be taking\nadvantage of me, so a barrier had to be built--a barrier that I should\nnever penetrate and that he should never be tempted to break down.\n\nLambertson had done that. For me. It was all there, suddenly, so\noverwhelming it made me gasp from the impact. I wanted to throw my arms\naround him; instead I sat down in the chair, shaking my head helplessly.\nI hated myself then. I had hated myself before, but never like this.\n\n\"If I could only go somewhere,\" I said. \"Someplace where nobody knew me,\nwhere I could just live by myself for a while, and shut the doors, and\nshut out the thoughts, and _pretend_ for a while, just pretend that I'm\nperfectly normal.\"\n\n\"I wish you could,\" Lambertson said. \"But you can't. You know that. Not\nunless Custer can really help.\"\n\nWe sat there for a while. Then I said, \"Let Aarons come down. Let him\nbring anybody he wants with him. I'll do what he wants. Until I see\nCuster.\"\n\nThat hurt, too, but it was different. It hurt both of us together, not\nseparately any more. And somehow it didn't hurt so much that way.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Monday, 22 May._ Aarons drove down from Boston this morning with a girl\nnamed Mary Bolton, and we went to work.\n\nI think I'm beginning to understand how a dog can tell when someone\nwants to kick him and doesn't quite dare. I could feel the back of my\nneck prickle when that man walked into the conference room. I was hoping\nhe might have changed since the last time I saw him. He hadn't, but I\nhad. I wasn't afraid of him any more, just awfully tired of him after\nhe'd been here about ten minutes.\n\nBut that girl! I wonder what sort of story he'd told her? She couldn't\nhave been more than sixteen, and she was terrorized. At first I thought\nit was _Aarons_ she was afraid of, but that wasn't so. It was _me_.\n\nIt took us all morning just to get around that. The poor girl could\nhardly make herself talk. She was shaking all over when they arrived. We\ntook a walk around the grounds, alone, and I read her bit by bit--a\nfeeler here, a planted suggestion there, just getting her used to the\nidea and trying to reassure her. After a while she was smiling. She\nthought the lagoon was lovely, and by the time we got back to the main\nbuilding she was laughing, talking about herself, beginning to relax.\n\nThen I gave her a full blast, quickly, only a moment or two. _Don't be\nafraid--I hate him, yes, but I won't hurt you for anything. Let me come\nin, don't fight me. We've got to work as a team._\n\nIt shook her. She turned white and almost passed out for a moment. Then\nshe nodded, slowly. \"I see,\" she said. \"It feels as if it's way inside,\n_deep_ inside.\"\n\n\"That's right. It won't hurt. I promise.\"\n\nShe nodded again. \"Let's go back, now. I think I'm ready to try.\"\n\nWe went to work.\n\nI was as blind as she was, at first. There was nothing there, at first,\nnot even a flicker of brightness. Then, probing deeper, something\nresponded, only a hint, a suggestion of something powerful, deep and\nhidden--but where? What was her strength? Where was she weak? I couldn't\ntell.\n\nWe started on dice, crude, of course, but as good a tool as any. Dice\nare no good for measuring anything, but that was why I was there. I was\nthe measuring instrument. The dice were only reactors. Sensitive enough,\ntwo balsam cubes, tossed from a box with only gravity to work against. I\nshowed her first, picked up her mind as the dice popped out, led her\nthrough it. _Take one at a time, the red one first. Work on it, see? Now\nwe try both. Once more--watch it! All right, now._\n\nShe sat frozen in the chair. She was trying; the sweat stood out on her\nforehead. Aarons sat tense, smoking, his fingers twitching as he watched\nthe red and green cubes bounce on the white backdrop. Lambertson watched\ntoo, but his eyes were on the girl, not on the cubes.\n\nIt was hard work. Bit by bit she began to grab; whatever I had felt in\nher mind seemed to leap up. I probed her, amplifying it, trying to draw\nit out. It was like wading through knee-deep mud--sticky, sluggish,\nresisting. I could feel her excitement growing, and bit by bit I\nreleased my grip, easing her out, baiting her.\n\n\"All right,\" I said. \"That's enough.\"\n\nShe turned to me, wide-eyed. \"I--I did it.\"\n\nAarons was on his feet, breathing heavily. \"It worked?\"\n\n\"It worked. Not very well, but it's there. All she needs is time, and\nhelp, and patience.\"\n\n\"But it worked! Lambertson! Do you know what that means? It means I was\nright! It means others can have it, just like she has it!\" He rubbed his\nhands together. \"We can arrange a full-time lab for it, and work on\nthree or four latents simultaneously. It's a wide-open door, Michael!\nCan't you see what it means?\"\n\nLambertson nodded, and gave me a long look. \"Yes, I think I do.\"\n\n\"I'll start arrangements tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Not tomorrow. You'll have to wait until next week.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because Amy would prefer to wait, that's why.\"\n\nAarons looked at him, and then at me, peevishly. Finally he shrugged.\n\"If you insist.\"\n\n\"We'll talk about it next week,\" I said. I was so tired I could hardly\nlook up at him. I stood up, and smiled at my girl. Poor kid, I thought.\nSo excited and eager about it now. And not one idea in the world of what\nshe was walking into.\n\nCertainly Aarons would never be able to tell her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater, when they were gone, Lambertson and I walked down toward the\nlagoon. It was a lovely cool evening; the ducks were down at the water's\nedge. Every year there was a mother duck herding a line of ducklings\ndown the shore and into the water. They never seemed to go where she\nwanted them to, and she would fuss and chatter, waddling back time and\nagain to prod the reluctant ones out into the pool.\n\nWe stood by the water's edge in silence for a long time. Then Lambertson\nkissed me. It was the first time he had ever done that.\n\n\"We could go away,\" I whispered in his ear. \"We could run out on Aarons\nand the Study Center and everyone, just go away somewhere.\"\n\nHe shook his head slowly. \"Amy, don't.\"\n\n\"We could! I'll see Dr. Custer, and he'll tell me he can help, I _know_\nhe will. I won't _need_ the Study Center any more, or any other place,\nor anybody but you.\"\n\nHe didn't answer, and I knew there wasn't anything he could answer. Not\nthen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Friday, 26 May._ Yesterday we went to Boston to see Dr. Custer, and now\nit looks as if it's all over. Now even I can't pretend that there's\nanything more to be done.\n\nNext week Aarons will come down, and I'll go to work with him just the\nway he has it planned. He thinks we have three years of work ahead of us\nbefore anything can be published, before he can really be sure we have\nbrought a latent into full use of his psi potential. Maybe so, I don't\nknow. Maybe in three years I'll find some way to make myself care one\nway or the other. But I'll do it, anyway, because there's nothing else\nto do.\n\nThere was no anatomical defect--Dr. Custer was right about that. The\neyes are perfect, beautiful gray eyes, he says, and the optic nerves and\nauditory nerves are perfectly functional. The defect isn't there. It's\ndeeper. Too deep ever to change it.\n\n_What you no longer use, you lose_, was what he said, apologizing\nbecause he couldn't explain it any better. It's like a price tag,\nperhaps. Long ago, before I knew anything at all, the psi was so strong\nit started compensating, bringing in more and more from _other_\nminds--such a wealth of rich, clear, interpreted visual and auditory\nimpressions that there was never any need for my own. And because of\nthat, certain hookups never got hooked up. That's only a theory, of\ncourse, but there isn't any other way to explain it.\n\nBut am I wrong to hate it? More than anything else in the world I want\nto _see_ Lambertson, _see_ him smile and light his pipe, _hear_ him\nlaugh. I want to know what color _really_ is, what music _really_ sounds\nlike unfiltered through somebody else's ears.\n\nI want to see a sunset, just once. Just once I want to see that mother\nduck take her ducklings down to the water. But I never will. Instead, I\nsee and hear things nobody else can, and the fact that I am stone blind\nand stone deaf shouldn't make any difference. After all, I've always\nbeen that way.\n\nMaybe next week I'll ask Aarons what he thinks about it. It should be\ninteresting to hear what he says.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SECOND SIGHT***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 22997.txt or 22997.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/2/9/9/22997\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://www.gutenberg.org/about/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
