Five gallons--a dollar ten. Did\nhe have that much? He began to assemble various small hoards of change\nfrom different pockets.\n\n\"Do you think we're going to like this?\" Ricky waved her hand vaguely in\na gesture which included a dilapidated hot-dog stand and a stretch of\nroad white-hot under the steady baking of the sun.\n\n\"Well, I think that Pirate's Haven is slightly different from our\npresent surroundings. Where's your proper pride? Not everyone can be\nclassed among the New Poor,\" Val observed judiciously.\n\n\"Nobility in the bread line.\" His sister sniffed with what she fondly\nbelieved was the air of a Van Astor dowager.\n\n\"Nobility?\"\n\n\"We never relinquished the title, did we? Rupert's still the Marquess of\nLorne.\"\n\n\"After some two hundred years in America I am afraid that we would find\nourselves strangers in England. And Lorne crumbled to dust long ago.\"\n\n\"But he's still Marquess of Lorne,\" she persisted.\n\n\"All right. And what does that make you?\"\n\n\"Lady Richanda, of course, silly. Can't you remember the wording of the\nold charter? And you're Viscount--\"\n\n\"Wrong there,\" Val corrected her. \"I'm only a lord, by courtesy, unless\nwe can bash Rupert on the head some dark night and chuck him into the\nbayou.\"\n\n\"Lord Valerius.\" She rolled it upon her tongue. \"Marquess, Lady, and\nLord Val, out to seek their fortunes. Pity we can't do it in the\ntraditional family way.\"\n\n\"But we can't, you know,\" he protested laughingly. \"I believe that\npiracy is no longer looked upon with favor by the more solid members of\nany community. Though plank-walking is an idea to keep in mind when the\nbill collectors start to draw in upon us.\"\n\n\"Here comes Rupert at last. Rupert,\" she raised her voice as their elder\nbrother opened the door by the driver's seat, \"shall we all go and be\npirates? Val has some lovely gory ideas.\"\n\n\"Not just yet anyway--we still have a roof over our heads,\" he answered\nas he slid in behind the wheel. \"We should have taken the right turn a\nmile back.\"\n\n\"Bother!\" Ricky surveyed as much of her face as she could see in the\npostage-stamp mirror of her compact. \"I don't think I'm going to like\nLouisiana.\"\n\n\"Maybe Louisiana won't care for you either,\" Val offered slyly. \"After\nall, we dyed-in-the-wool Yanks coming to live in the deep South--\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself, Val Ralestone.\" She applied a puff carefully to the\ntip of her upturned nose. \"Since we've got this barn of a place on our\nhands, we might as well live in it. Too bad you couldn't have persuaded\nour artist tenant to sign another lease, Rupert.\"\n\n\"He's gone to spend a year in Italy. The place is in fairly good\ncondition though. LeFleur said that as long as we don't use the left\nwing and close off the state bedrooms, we can manage nicely.\"\n\n\"State bedrooms--\" Val drew a deep breath which was meant to be one of\nreverence but which turned into a sneeze as the roadster's wheels raised\nthe dust. \"How does it feel to own such magnificence, Rupert?\"\n\n\"Not so good,\" he replied honestly. \"A house as big as Pirate's Haven is\na burden if you don't have the cash to keep it up properly. Though this\nartist chap did make a lot of improvements on his own.\"\n\n\"But think of the Long Hall--\" began Ricky, rolling her eyes heavenward.\n\n\"And just what do you know about the Long Hall?\" demanded Rupert.\n\n\"Why, that's where dear Great-great-uncle Rick's ghost is supposed to\nwalk, isn't it?\" she asked innocently. \"I hope that our late tenant\ndidn't scare him away. It gives one such a blue-blooded feeling to think\nof having an active ghost on the premises. A member of one's own family,\ntoo!\"\n\n\"Sure. Teach him--or it--some parlor tricks and we'll show it--or\nhim--off every afternoon between three and four. We might even be able\nto charge admission and recoup the family fortune,\" Val suggested\nbrightly.\n\n\"Have you no reverence?\" demanded his sister. \"And besides, ghosts only\nwalk at night.\"\n\n\"Now that's something we'll have to investigate,\" Val interrupted her.\n\"Do ghosts have union rules? I mean, I wouldn't want Great-great-uncle\nRick to march up and down the carriage drive with a sign reading, 'The\nRalestones are unfair to ghosts,' or anything like that.\"\n\n\"We'll have to use the Long Hall, of course,\" cut in Rupert, as usual\nignoring their nonsense. \"And the old summer drawing-room. But we can\nshut up the dining-room and the ball-room. We'll eat in the kitchen, and\nthat and a bedroom apiece--\"\n\n\"I suppose there are bathrooms, or at least a bathroom,\" his brother\ninterrupted. \"Because I don't care to rush down to the bayou for a good\nbrisk plunge every time I get my face dirty.\"\n\n\"Harrison put in a bathroom at his own expense last fall.\"\n\n\"For which blessed be the name of Harrison. If he hadn't gone to Italy,\nhe would have rebuilt the house. How soon do we get there? This touring\nis not what I thought it might be--\"\n\nThe crease which had appeared so recently between Rupert's eyes\ndeepened.\n\n\"Leg hurt, Val?\" he asked quietly, glancing at the slim figure sharing\nhis seat.\n\n\"No. I'm expressing curiosity this time, old man, not just a whine. But\nif we're going to be this far off the main highway--\"\n\n\"Oh, it's not far from the city road. We ought to be seeing the\ngate-posts any moment now.\"\n\n\"Prophet!\" Ricky leaned forward between them. \"See there!\"\n\nTwo gray stone posts, as firmly planted by time as the avenue of\nlive-oaks they headed, showed clearly in the afternoon light. And from\nthe nearest, deep carven in the stone, a jagged-toothed skull, crowned\nand grinning, stared blankly at the three in the shabby car. Beneath it\nran the insolent motto of an ancient and disreputable clan, \"What I\nwant--I take!\"\n\n\"This is the place all right--I recognize Joe there.\" Val pointed to the\ncrest. \"Good old Joe, always laughing.\"\n\nRicky made a face. \"Horrid old thing. I don't see why we couldn't have\nhad a swan or something nice to swank about.\"\n\n\"But then the Lords of Lorne were hardly a nice lot in their prime,\" Val\nreminded her. \"Well, Rupert, let's see the rest.\"\n\nThe car followed a graveled drive between tall bushes which would have\nbeen the better for a pruning. Then the road made a sudden curve and\nthey came out upon a crescent of lawn bordering upon a stone-paved\nterrace three steps above. And on the terrace stood the home a Ralestone\nhad not set foot in for over fifty years--Pirate's Haven.\n\n\"It looks--\" Ricky stared up, \"why, it looks just like the picture Mr.\nHarrison painted!\"\n\n\"Which proves why he is now in Italy,\" Val returned. \"But he did capture\nit on canvas.\"\n\n\"Gray stone--and those diamond-paned windows--and that squatty tower.\nBut it isn't like a Southern home at all! It's some old, old place out\nof England.\"\n\n\"Because it was built by an exile,\" said Rupert softly. \"An exile who\nloved his home so well that he labored five years in the wilderness to\nbuild its duplicate. Those little diamond-paned windows were once\nprotected with shutters an inch thick, and the place was a fort in\nIndian times. But it is strange to this country. That's why it's one of\nthe show places. LeFleur asked me if we would be willing to keep up the\ncustom of throwing the state rooms open to the public one day a month.\"\n\n\"And shall we?\" asked Ricky.\n\n\"We'll see. Well, don't you want to see the inside as well as the out?\"\n\n\"Of course! Val, you lazy thing, get out!\"\n\n\"Certainly, m'lady.\" He swung open the door and climbed out stiffly.\nAlthough he wouldn't have confessed it for any reason, his leg had been\naching dully for hours.\n\n\"Do you know,\" Ricky hesitated on the first terrace step, bending down\nto put aside a trail of morning-glory vine which clutched at her ankle,\n\"I've just remembered!\"\n\n\"What?\" Rupert looked up from the grid where he was unstrapping their\nluggage.\n\n\"That we are the very first Ralestones to--to come home since\nGrandfather Miles rode away in 1867.\"\n\n\"And why the sudden dip into ancient history?\" Val inquired as he limped\naround to help Rupert.\n\n\"I don't know,\" her eyes were fast upon moss-greened wall and ponderous\ndoor hewn of a single slab of oak, \"except--well, we are coming home at\nlast. I wonder if--if they know. All those others. Rick and Miles, the\nfirst Rupert and Richard and--\"\n\n\"That spitfire, the Lady Richanda?\" Rupert smiled. \"Perhaps they do. No,\nleave the bags here, Val. Let's see the house first.\"\n\nTogether the Ralestones crossed the terrace and came to stand by the\nfront door which still bore faint scars left by Indian hatchets. But\nRupert stooped to insert a very modern key into a very modern lock.\nThere was a click and the door swung inward before his push.\n\n\"The Long Hall!\" They stood in something of a hesitant huddle at the end\nof a long stone-floored room. Half-way down its length a wooden\nstaircase led up to the second floor, and directly opposite that a great\nfireplace yawned mightily, black and bare.\n\nA leather-covered lounge was directly before this, flanked by two square\nchairs. And by the stairs was an oaken marriage chest. Save for two skin\nrugs, these were all the furnishings.\n\nBut Ricky had crossed hesitatingly to that cavernous fireplace and was\nstanding there looking up as her brothers joined her.\n\n\"There's where it was,\" she said softly and pointed to a deep niche cut\ninto the surface of the stone overmantel. That niche was empty and had\nbeen so for more than a hundred years--to their hurt. \"That was where\nthe Luck--\"\n\n\"How hold ye Lorne?\" Rupert's softly spoken question brought the\nwell-remembered answer to Val's lips:\n\n\"By the oak leaf, by the sea wave, by the broadsword blade, thus hold we\nLorne!\"\n\n\"The oak leaf is dust,\" murmured Ricky, \"the sea wave is gone, the\nbroadsword is rust, how now hold ye Lorne?\"\n\nHer brothers answered her together:\n\n\"By our Luck, thus hold we Lorne!\"\n\n\"And we've got to get it back,\" she said. \"We've just got to! When the\nLuck hangs there again, we--\"\n\n\"Won't have anything left to worry about,\" Val finished for her. \"But\nthat's a very big order, m'lady. Short of catching Rick's ghost and\nforcing him to disclose the place where he hid it, I don't see how we're\ngoing to do it.\"\n\n\"But we are going to,\" she answered confidently. \"I know we are!\"\n\n\"A good thing,\" Rupert broke in, a hint of soberness beneath the\nlightness of his tone as he looked about the almost bare room and then\nat the strained pallor of Val's thin face. \"The Ralestones have been\nluckless too long. And now suppose we take possession of this commodious\nmansion. I suggest that we get settled as soon as possible. I don't like\nthe looks of the western sky. We're probably going to have a storm.\"\n\n\"What about the car?\" Val asked as his brother turned to go.\n\n\"Harrison used the old carriage house as a garage. I'll run it in there.\nYou and Ricky better do a spot of exploring and see about beds and food.\nI don't know how you feel,\" he went on grimly, \"but after last night I\nwant something softer than a dozen rocks to sleep on.\"\n\n\"I told you not to stop at that tourist place,\" began Ricky smugly. \"I\nsaid--\"\n\n\"You said that a house painted that shade of green made you slightly\nill. But you didn't say anything about beds,\" Val reminded her as he\nshed his coat and hung it on the newel-post. \"And since the Ralestone\nfamily have definitely gone off the gold or any other monetary standard,\nit's tourist rests or the poorhouse for us.\"\n\n\"Probably the poorhouse.\" Rupert sounded resigned. \"Now upstairs with\nyou and get out some bedding. LeFleur said in his letter that the place\nwas all ready for occupancy. And he stocked up with canned stuff.\"\n\n\"I know--beans! Just too, too divine. Well, let's know the worst.\" Ricky\nstarted up the stairs. \"I suppose there are electric lights?\"\n\n\"Got to throw the main switch first, and I haven't time to do that now.\nHere, Val.\" Rupert tossed him his tiny pocket torch as he turned to go.\nThe door closed behind him and Ricky looked over her shoulder.\n\n\"This--this is rather a darkish place, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Not so bad.\" Val considered the hall below, which seemed suddenly\npeopled by an overabundance of oddly shaped shadows.\n\n\"No,\" her voice grew stronger, \"not so bad. We're together anyway, Val.\nLast year I thought I'd die, shut up in that awful school, and then\ncoming home to hear--\"\n\n\"About me making my first and last flight. Yes, not exactly a rest cure\nfor any of us, was it? But it's all over now. The Ralestones may be down\nbut they're not out, yet, in spite of Mosile Oil and those coal-mines.\nD'you know, we might use some of that nice gilt-edged stock for\nwall-paper. There's enough to cover a closet at least. Here we are,\nRupert from beating about the globe trying to be a newspaper man, you\nstraight from N'York's finest finishing-school, and me--well, out of the\nplainest hospital bed I ever saw. We've got this house and what Rupert\nmanaged to clear from the wreck. Something will turn up. In the\nmeantime--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" she prompted.\n\n\"In the meantime,\" he went on, leaning against the banister for a\nmoment's rest, \"we can be looking for the Luck. As Rupert says, we need\nit badly enough. Here's the upper hall. Which way now?\"\n\n\"Over to the left wing. These in front are what Rupert refers to as\n'state bedrooms.'\"\n\n\"Yes?\" He opened the nearest door and whistled softly. \"Not so bad.\nAbout the size of a small union station and provided with all the\ncomforts of a tomb. Decidedly not what we want.\"\n\n\"Wait, here's a plaque set in the wall. Look!\" She ran her finger over a\nglass-covered square.\n\n\"Regulations for guests, or a floor plan to show how to reach the\ndining-room in the quickest way,\" her brother suggested.\n\n\"No.\" She read aloud slowly:\n\n     \"'This Room Was Occupied by General Andrew Jackson, the Victor\n     of the Battle of New Orleans, upon the Tenth Day after the\n     Battle.'\"\n\n\"Whew! 'Old Hickory' here! But I thought that the Ralestones were more\nor less under a cloud at that time,\" commented Val.\n\n\"History--\"\n\n\"In the making. Quite so. Now may I suggest that we find some slumber\nrooms slightly more modern? Rupert is apt to become annoyed at undue\ndelay in such matters.\"\n\nThey went down the hall and turned into a short cross corridor. From a\nround window at the far end a ray of sun still swept in, but it was a\nsickly, faded ray. The storm Rupert had spoken of could not be far off.\n\n\"This is the right way. Mr. Harrison had these little numbers put on the\ndoors for his guests,\" Ricky pointed out. \"I'll take 'three'; that was\nmarked on the plan he sent us as a lady's room. You take that one across\nthe hall and let Rupert have the one next to you.\"\n\nThe rooms they explored were not as imposing as the one which had\nsheltered Andrew Jackson for a night. Furnished with chintz-covered\nchairs, solid mahogany bedsteads and highboys, they were pleasant enough\neven if they weren't chambers to make an antique dealer \"Oh!\" and \"Ah!\"\nVal discovered with approval some stiff prints of mathematically correct\nclippers hung in exact patterns on his walls, while Ricky's room held\none treasure, a dainty dressing-table.\n\nA small door near the end of the hall gave upon a linen closet. And\nRicky, throwing her short white jacket and hat upon the chair in her\nroom, set about making beds, having given Val strict orders to return to\nthe lower hall and sort out the luggage before bringing it up.\n\nAs he reached the wide landing he stopped a moment. Since that winter\nnight, almost a year in the past, when a passenger plane had decided--in\nspite of its pilot--to make a landing on a mountainside, he had learned\nto hobble where he had once run. The accident having made his right leg\na rather accurate barometer, that crooked bone was announcing the\narrival of the coming storm with a sharp pain or two which shot\nunexpectedly from knee to ankle. One such caught him as he was about to\ntake a step and threw him suddenly off balance.\n\nHe clutched at a dim tapestry which hung across the wall and tumbled\nthrough a slit in the fabric--which smelled of dust and moth balls--into\na tiny alcove flanking a broad, well-cushioned window-seat under tall\nwindows. Below him in a riot of bushes and hedges run wild, lay the\ngarden. Somewhere beyond must lie Bayou Mercier leading directly to Lake\nBorgne and so to the sea, the thoroughfare used by their pirate\nancestors when they brought home their spoil.\n\nThe green of the rank growth below, thought Val, seemed intensified by\nthe strange yellowish light. A moss-grown path led straight into the\nheart of a jungle where sweet olive, banana trees, and palms grew in a\nmatted mass. Harrison might have done wonders for the house but he had\nallowed the garden to lapse into a wilderness.\n\n\"Val!\"\n\n\"Coming!\" he shouted and pushed back through the curtain. He could hear\nRupert moving about the lower hall.\n\n\"Just made it in time,\" he said as the younger Ralestone limped down to\njoin him. \"Hear that?\"\n\nA steady pattering outside was growing into a wild dash of wind-driven\nrain. It was dark and Rupert himself was but a blur moving across the\nhall.\n\n\"Do you still have the flash? Might as well descend into the lower\nregions and put on the lights.\"\n\nThey crossed the Long Hall, passing through another large chamber where\nfurniture huddled under dust covers, and then into a small\ncupboard-lined passage. This gave upon a dark cavern where Val's hand\nscraped a table top only too painfully as he went. Then Rupert found the\ndoor leading to the cellar, and they went down and down into inky\nblackness upon which their thread of torch-light made little impression.\n\nThe damp, unpleasant scent of mold and wet grew stronger as they\ndescended, and their fingers brushed slime-touched walls.\n\n\"Phew! Not very comfy down here,\" Val protested as Rupert threw the\ntorch beam along the nearest wall. With a grunt of relief he stepped\nforward to pull open the door of a small black box. \"That does it,\" he\nsaid as he threw the switch. \"Now for the topside again and some\nsupper.\"\n\nThey negotiated the steps and found the button which controlled the\nkitchen lights. The glare showed them a room on the mammoth scale\nsuggested by the Long Hall. A giant fireplace still equipped with\nthree-legged pots, toasting irons, and spits was at one side, its brick\noven beside it. But a very modern range and sink faced it.\n\nIn the center of the room was a large table, while along the far wall\nwere closed cupboards. Save for its size and the novelty of the\nfireplace, it was an ordinary kitchen, complete to red-checked curtains\nat the windows. Pleasant and homey, Val thought rather wistfully. But\nthat was before the coming of that night when Ricky walked in the garden\nand he heard something stir in the Long Hall--which should have been\nempty--\n\n\"Val! Rupert!\" A cry which started valiantly became a wail as it echoed\nthrough empty rooms. \"Where are yo-o-ou!\"\n\n\"Here, in the kitchen,\" Val shouted back.\n\nA moment later Ricky stood in the doorway, her face flushed and her\nusually correct curls all on end.\n\n\"Mean, selfish, utterly selfish pigs!\" she burst out. \"Leaving me all\nalone in the dark! And it's so dark!\"\n\n\"We just went down to turn on the lights,\" Val began.\n\n\"So I see.\" With a sniff she looked about her. \"It took two of you to do\nthat. But it only required one of me to make three beds. Well, this is a\nwarning to me. Next time--\" she did not finish her threat. \"I suppose\nyou want some supper?\"\n\nRupert was already at the cupboards. \"That,\" he agreed, \"is the general\nidea.\"\n\n\"Beans or--\" Ricky's hand closed upon Val's arm with a nipper-like grip.\n\"What,\" her voice was a thin thread of sound, \"was that?\"\n\nAbove the steady beat of the rain they heard a noise which was half\nscratch, half thud. Under Rupert's hand the latch of the cupboard\nclicked.\n\n\"Back door,\" he said laconically.\n\n\"Well, why don't you open it?\" Ricky's fingers bit tighter so that Val\nlonged to twist out of her grip.\n\nThe key grated in the lock and then Rupert shot back the accompanying\nbolt.\n\n\"Something's there,\" breathed Ricky.\n\n\"Probably nothing but a branch blown against the door by the wind,\" Val\nassured her, remembering the tangled state of the garden.\n\nThe door came back, letting in a douche of cold rain and a black shadow\nwhich leaped for the security of the center of the room.\n\n\"Look!\" Ricky laughed unsteadily and released Val's arm.\n\nIn the center of the neat kitchen, spitting angrily at the wet, stood a\nruffled and oversized black tom-cat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE LUCK OF THE LORDS OF LORNE\n\n\n\"Nice of you to drop in, old man,\" commented Rupert dryly as he shut the\ndoor. \"But didn't anyone ever mention to you that gentlemen wipe their\nfeet before entering strange houses?\" He surveyed a line of wet paw\nprints across the brick floor.\n\n\"Did he get all wet, the poor little--\" Ricky was on her knees,\nstretching out her hand and positively cooing. The cat put down the paw\nhe had been licking and regarded her calmly out of round, yellow eyes.\nThen he returned to his washing. Val laughed.\n\n\"Evidently he is used to the strong, silent type of human, Ricky. I\nwonder where he belongs.\"\n\n\"He belongs to us now. Yes him does, doesn't him?\" She attempted to\ntouch the visitor's head. His ears went back and he showed sharp teeth\nin no uncertain manner.\n\n\"Better let him alone,\" advised Rupert. \"He doesn't seem to be the kind\nyou can cuddle.\"\n\n\"So I see.\" Ricky arose to her feet with an offended air. \"One would\nthink that I resembled the more repulsive members of my race.\"\n\n\"In the meantime,\" Rupert again sought the cupboard, \"let's eat.\"\n\nHalf an hour later, fed and well content (even Satan, as the Ralestones\nhad named their visitor because of his temperament, having condescended\nto accept some of the better-done bits of bacon), they sat about the\ntable staring at the dishes. Now it is a very well-known fact that\ndishes do _not_ obligingly leap from a table into a pan of well-soaped\nwater, slosh themselves around a few times, and jump out to do a spot of\nbrisk rubbing down. But how nice it would be if they did, thought Val.\n\n\"The dishes--\" began Ricky in a faint sort of way.\n\n\"Must be done. We gather that. How utterly nasty bacon grease looks when\nit's congealed.\" Her younger brother surveyed the platter before him\nwith mournful interest.\n\n\"And the question before the house is, I presume, who's going to wash\nthem?\" Rupert grinned. \"This seems to be as good a time as any to put\nsome sort of a working plan in force. There is a certain amount of\nso-called housework which has to be done. And there are three of us to\ndo it. It's up to us to apportion it fairly. Shall we say, let everyone\ncare for his or her own room--\"\n\n\"There are also the little matters of washing, and ironing, and\ncleaning,\" Ricky broke in to remind him.\n\n\"And we're down to fifty a month in hard cash. But the tenant farmer on\nthe other side of the bayou is to supply us with fresh fruit and\nvegetables. And our wardrobes are fairly intact. So I think that we can\nafford to hire the washing done. We'll take turns cooking--\"\n\n\"Who's elected to do the poisoning first?\" Val inquired with interest.\n\"I trust we possess a good cook-book?\"\n\n\"Well, I'll take breakfast tomorrow morning,\" Rupert volunteered.\n\"Anyone can boil coffee and toast bread. As for dishes, we'll all pitch\nin together. And suppose we start right now.\"\n\nWhen the dishes were back again in their neat piles on the cupboard\nshelves, Ricky vanished upstairs, to come trailing down again in a\nhouse-coat which she fondly imagined made her look like one of the\nbetter-known screen sirens. The family gathered in an aimless way before\nthe empty fireplace of the Long Hall. Rupert was filling a black pipe\nwhich allowed him to resemble--in very slight degree, decided Val--an\nexplorer in an English tobacco advertisement. Val himself was stretched\nfull length on the couch with about ten pounds of cat attempting to rest\non his center section in spite of his firm refusal to allow the same.\n\n\"Br-r-r!\" Ricky shivered. \"It's cold in here.\"\n\n\"Probably just Uncle Rick passing through--not the weather. No, cat, you\nmay not sit on that stomach. It's just as full of bacon as yours is and\nit wants a nice long rest.\" Val swept Satan off to the floor and he\nresignedly went to roost by the boy's feet in spite of the beguiling\nnoises Ricky made to attract his attention.\n\n\"These stone houses are cold.\" Rupert scratched a match on the sole of\nhis shoe. \"We ought to have flooring put down over this stone paving. I\nsaw some wood stacked up in an outhouse when I put the car away. We'll\nhave it in tomorrow and see what we can do about a fire in the evening.\"\n\n\"And I thought the South was always warm.\" Ricky examined her hands.\n\"Whoever,\" she remarked pleasantly, \"took my hand lotion better return\nit. The consequences might not be very attractive.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you packed it this morning?\" Val asked.\n\n\"But of--\" Her fingers went to her mouth. \"I wonder if I did? I've just\ngot to have some. We'll drive to town tomorrow and get a bottle.\"\n\n\"Thirty miles or so for a ten-cent bottle of gooey stuff,\" Val\nprotested.\n\n\"Good idea.\" Rupert stood with his back to the fireplace as if there\nreally were a flame or two within its black emptiness. \"I've some papers\nthat LeFleur wants to see. Then there're our boxes at the freight\nstation to arrange transportation for, and we'll have to see about\ngetting a newspaper and--\"\n\n\"Make a list,\" murmured his brother.\n\nRupert dropped down upon the wide arm of Ricky's chair and with her only\ntoo willing aid set to work. Val eyed them drowsily. Rupert and\nRicky--or to give her her very formal name in full--Richanda Anne, were\n\"Red\" Ralestones, possessing the thin, three-cornered faces, the dark\nmahogany hair, the sharply defined cheek-bones which had been the mark\nof the family as far back in history as portraits or written\ndescriptions existed. The \"Red\" Ralestones were marked also by height\nand a suppleness of body and movement. The men had been fine swordsmen,\nthe ladies noted beauties. But they were also cursed, Val remembered\nvividly, with uncertain tempers.\n\nRupert had schooled himself to the point where his emotions were\nmastered by his will. But Val had seen Ricky enjoy full tantrums, and\nthe last occasion was not so long ago that the scene had become misty in\nhis memory. Generous to the point of self-beggary, loyal to a fault, and\nincurably romantic, that was a \"Red\" Ralestone.\n\nVal himself was a \"Black\" Ralestone, which was a very different thing.\nThey were a new growth on the family tree, a growth which appeared after\nthe Ralestones had been exiled to colonial America. His black hair, his\nlong, dark face of no particular beauty marked with straight, black\nbrows set in a perpetual frown--that was the sign of a \"Black\"\nRalestone. They were as strong-willed as the \"Reds,\" but their anger\ncould be controlled to icy rage.\n\n\"Now that you have spent the monthly income,\" Val suggested as Rupert\nadded up a long column of minute figures scrawled across the first page\nof his pocket note-book, \"let's really get away from economics for one\nevening. The surroundings suggest something more romantic than dollars\nand cents. After all, when did a pirate ever show a saving disposition?\nWould the first Roderick--\"\n\n\"The Roderick who brought home the Luck?\" Ricky laughed. \"But he brought\nhome a fortune, too, didn't he, Rupert?\"\n\nHer brother relit his pipe. \"Yes, but a great many lords came home from\nthe Crusades with their pockets filled. Sir Roderick de la Stone thought\nthe Luck worth his entire estate even after he was made Baron\nRalestone.\"\n\nRicky shivered delicately. \"Not altogether nice people, those ancestors\nof ours,\" she observed.\n\n\"No,\" Val grinned. \"By rights this room should be full of ghosts instead\nof the beat of just one. How many Ralestones died violently? Seven or\neight, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"But the ones who died in England should haunt Lorne,\" argued Ricky,\nhalf seriously.\n\n\"Well then, that sort of confines us to the crews of the ships our\ngreat-great-great-grandfather scuttled,\" her brother replied.\n\n\"Rupert,\" Ricky turned and asked impulsively, \"do you really believe in\nthe Luck?\"\n\nRupert looked up at the empty niche. \"I don't know--No, I don't. Not the\nway that Roderick and Richard and all the rest did. But something that\nhas seven hundred years of history behind it--that means a lot.\"\n\n\"'Then did he take up ye sword fashioned by ye devilish art of ye East\nfrom two fine blades found in ye tomb,'\" Val quoted from the record of\nBrother Anselm, the friar who had accompanied Sir Roderick on his\ncrusading. \"Do you suppose that that part's true? Could the Luck have\nbeen made from two other swords found in an old tomb?\"\n\n\"Not impossible. The Saracens were master metal workers. Look at the\nDamascus blades.\"\n\n\"It all sounds like a fairy-tale,\" commented Ricky. \"A sword with magic\npowers beaten out of two other swords found in a tomb. And the whole\nthing done under the direction of an Arab astrologer.\"\n\n\"You've got to admit,\" broke in Val, \"that Sir Roderick had luck after\nit was given to him. He came home a wealthy man and he died a Baron. And\nhis descendants even survived the Wars of the Roses when four-fifths of\nthe great English families were wiped out.\"\n\n\"'And fortune continued to smile,'\" Rupert took up the story, \"'until a\ncertain wild Miles Ralestone staked the Luck of his house on the turn of\na card--and lost.'\"\n\n\"O-o-oh!\" Ricky squirmed forward in her chair. \"Now comes the pirate.\nTell us that, Rupert.\"\n\n\"You know the story by heart now,\" he objected.\n\n\"We never heard it here, where some of it really happened. Tell it,\nplease, Rupert!\"\n\n\"In your second childhood?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not out of my first yet,\" she answered promptly. \"Pretty please,\nRupert.\"\n\n\"Miles Ralestone, Marquess of Lorne,\" he began, \"rode with Prince Rupert\nof the Rhine. He was a notorious gambler, a loose liver, and a cynic.\nAnd he even threw the family Luck across the gaming table.\"\n\n\"'The Luck went from him who did it no honor,'\" Val repeated slowly. \"I\nread that in that old letter among your papers, Rupert.\"\n\n\"Yes, the Luck went from him. He survived Marston Moor; he survived the\ndeath of his royal master, Charles the First, on the scaffold. He lived\nlong enough to witness the return of the Stuarts to England. But the\nLuck was gone, and with it the good fortune of his line. Rupert, his\nson, was but a penniless hanger-on at the royal court; the manor of\nLorne a fire-gutted wreckage.\n\n\"Rupert followed James Stuart from England when that monarch became a\nfugitive to escape the wrath of his subjects. And the Marquess of Lorne\nsank to the role of pot-house bully in the back lanes of Paris.\"\n\n\"And then?\" prompted Val.\n\n\"And then a miracle occurred. Rupert was employed by his master on a\nsecret mission to London, and there the Luck came again into his hands.\nPerhaps by murder. But he died miserably enough of a heavy cold got by\nlying in a ditch to escape Dutch William's soldiers.\"\n\n\"'So is this perilous Luck come again into our hands. Then did I\npersevere to mend the fortunes of my house.' That's what Rupert's son\nRichard wrote about the Luck,\" Ricky recalled. \"Richard, the first\npirate.\"\n\n\"He did a good job of fortune mending,\" commented Val dryly. \"Married\none of the wealthiest of the French king's wards and sailed for the\nFrench West Indies all in a fortnight. Turned pirate with the approval\nof the French and took to lifting the cargoes of other pirates.\"\n\n\"I'll bet that most of his success was due to the Lady Richanda,\"\nobserved Ricky. \"She sailed with him dressed in man's clothes. Remember\nthat miniature of her that we saw in New York, the one in the museum?\nAll the 'Black' Ralestones are supposed to look like her. Hear that,\nVal?\"\n\n\"At least it was the Lady Richanda who persuaded her husband to settle\nashore,\" said Rupert. \"She was personally acquainted with Bienville and\nIberville who were proposing to rule the Mississippi valley for France\nby building a city near the mouth of the river. And 'Black Dick,' the\npirate, obtained a grant of land lying along Lake Borgne and this bayou.\nAlthough the city was not begun until 1724, this house was started in\n1710 by workmen imported from England.\n\n\"The house of an exile,\" Rupert continued slowly. \"Richard Ralestone was\nborn in England, but he left there in his tenth year. In spite of the\nprice on his head, he crept back to Devon in 1709 to see Lorne for the\nlast time. And it was from the rude sketches he made of ruined Lorne\nthat Pirate's Haven was planned.\"\n\n\"Why, we saw those sketches!\" Ricky's eyes shone with excitement. \"Do\nyou remember, Val?\"\n\nHer brother nodded. \"Must have cost him plenty to do it,\" he replied.\n\"Richard had an immense personal fortune of his own gained from piracy,\nand he spared no expense in building. The larger part of the stone in\nthese walls was brought straight from Europe, just as they later brought\nthe paving blocks for the streets of New Orleans. When he had done--and\nthe place was five years a-building because of Indian troubles and other\ndisturbances--he settled down to live in feudal state. Some of his\nformer seamen rallied around him as a guard, and he imported blacks from\nthe islands to work his indigo fields.\n\n\"The family continued to prosper through both French and Spanish\ndomination until the time of American rule.\"\n\n\"Now for Uncle Rick.\" Ricky settled herself with a wriggle. \"This is\neven more exciting than Pirate Dick.\"\n\n\"In the year 1788, the time of the great fire which destroyed over half\nof New Orleans, twin boys were born at Pirate's Haven. They came into\ntheir heritage early, for their parents died of yellow fever when the\ntwins were still small children.\n\n\"Those were restless times. New Orleans was full of refugees. From\nHaiti, where the revolting blacks were holding a reign of terror, and\nfrom France, where to be a noble was to be a dead one, came hundreds.\nEven members of the royal house, the Duc d'Orleans and his brother, the\nDuc de Montpensier, came for a space in 1798.\n\n\"The city had always been more or less lawless and intolerant of\ncontrol. Like the New Englanders of the eighteenth century, many\nrespected merchants were also smugglers.\"\n\n\"And pirates,\" suggested Val.\n\n\"The king of smugglers was Jean Lafitte. His forge--where his slaves\nshaped the wrought-iron which was one of the wonders of the city--was a\nfashionable meeting-place for the young bloods. He was the height of wit\nand fashion--daring openly to placard the walls of the town with his\nnotices of smugglers' sales.\n\n\"And Roderick Ralestone, the younger of the twins, became one of\nLafitte's men. In spite of the remonstrances of his brother Richard,\nyoung Rick withdrew to Barataria with Dominque You and the rest of the\noutlawed captains.\n\n\"In the winter of 1814 matters came to a head. Richard wanted to marry\nan American girl, the daughter of one of Governor Claiborne's friends.\nHer father told him very pointedly that since the owners of Pirate's\nHaven seemed to be indulging in law breaking, such a marriage was out of\nthe question. Aroused, Richard made a secret inspection of certain\nunderground storehouses which had been built by his pirate\ngreat-grandfather and discovered that Rick had put them in use again for\nthe very same purpose for which they had been first intended--the\nstoring of loot.\n\n\"He waited there for his brother, determined to have it decided once and\nfor all. They quarreled bitterly. Both were young, both had bad tempers,\nand each saw his side as the right of the matter--\"\n\n\"Regular Ralestones, weren't they?\" commented Val slyly.\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" agreed Rupert. \"Well, at last Richard started for the\nhouse, his brother in pursuit.\n\n\"Then they fought, here in this very hall. And not with words this time,\nbut with the rapiers Richard had brought back from France. A slave named\nFalesse, who had been the twins' childhood nurse, was the only witness\nto the end of that duel. Richard lay face down across the hearth-stone\nas she came screaming down the stairs.\"\n\nRicky was studying the gray stone.\n\n\"By rights,\" Val agreed with her unspoken thought, \"there ought to be a\nstain there. Unfortunately for romance, there isn't.\"\n\n\"Rick was standing by the door,\" Rupert continued. \"When Falesse reached\nhis brother, he laughed unsteadily and half raised his sword in a\nduelist's salute. Then he was gone. But there were two swords on the\nfloor. And that niche was empty.\n\n\"When he fled into the night storm with his brother's blood staining his\nhands, Rick Ralestone took the Luck of his house with him.\n\n\"After almost a year of invalidism, Richard recovered. He never married\nhis American beauty. But in 1819 he took a wife, a young Creole lady\nwidowed by the Battle of New Orleans. Of Rick nothing was heard again,\nalthough his brother searched diligently for more than thirty years.\"\n\n\"How,\" Val grinned at his brother, \"did Richard explain the little\nmatter of the ghost which is supposed to walk at night?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But when the Civil War broke out, Richard's son Miles was\nthe master of Pirate's Haven. The once-great fortune of the family had\nshrunk. Business losses in the city, floods, a disaster at sea, had\nemptied the family purse--\"\n\n\"The Luck getting in its dirty work by remote control,\" supplied the\nirrepressible Val.\n\n\"Perhaps. Young Miles had married in his teens, and the call to the\nConfederate colors brought both his twin sons under arms as well as\ntheir father.\n\n\"Miles, the father, fell in the First Battle of Bull Run. But Miles, the\nson and elder of the twins, a lieutenant of cavalry, came out of the war\nthe only surviving male of his family.\n\n\"His brother Richard had been wounded and was home on sick leave when\nthe Northerners occupied New Orleans. Betrayed by one of his former\nslaves, a mulatto who bore a grudge against the family, he was murdered\nby a gang of bullies and cutthroats who had followed the invading army.\n\n\"Richard had been warned of their raid and had managed to hide the\nfamily valuables in a secret place--somewhere within this very hall,\naccording to tradition.\"\n\nVal and Ricky sat up and looked about with wondering interest.\n\n\"But Richard was shot down in cold blood when he refused to reveal the\nhiding-place. His brother and some scouts, operating south without\norders, arrived just in time to witness the last act. Miles Ralestone\nand his men summarily shot the murderers. But where Richard had so\ncarefully concealed the last of the family treasure was never\ndiscovered.\n\n\"The war beggared the Ralestones. Miles went north in search of better\nluck, and this place was allowed to molder until it was leased in 1879\nto a sugar baron. In 1895 it was turned over to a family distantly\nconnected with ours. And since then it has been leased. We have had in\nall four tenants.\"\n\n\"But,\" Ricky broke in, \"since the Luck went we have not prospered. And\nuntil it returns--\"\n\nRupert tapped out his pipe against one of the fire irons. \"It's nothing\nbut a folk-tale,\" he told her.\n\n\"It isn't!\" Ricky contradicted him vehemently. \"And we've made a good\nbeginning anyway. We've come back.\"\n\n\"If Rick took the Luck with him, I don't see how we have an earthly\nchance of finding it again,\" Val commented.\n\n\"It came back once before after it had gone from us,\" reminded his\nsister. \"And I think that it will again. At least I'll hope so.\"\n\n\"Outside of the superstition, it would be well worth having. The names\nof the heads and heirs of the house are all engraved along the blade,\nfrom Sir Roderick on down. Seven hundred years of history scratched on\nsteel.\" Rupert stretched and then glanced at his wrist-watch. \"Ten to\nten, and we've had a long day. Who's for bed?\"\n\n\"I am, for one.\" Val swung his feet down from the couch, disturbing\nSatan who opened one yellow eye lazily.\n\nRicky stood by the fireplace fingering the wreath of stiff flowers\ncarved in the stone. Val took her by the arm.\n\n\"No use wondering which one you push to reveal the treasure,\" he told\nher.\n\nShe looked up startled. \"How did you know what I was thinking about?\"\nshe demanded.\n\n\"My lady, your thoughts, like little white birds--\"\n\n\"Oh, go to bed, Val. When you get poetical I know you need sleep. Just\nthe same,\" she hesitated with one foot on the first tread of the stair,\n\"I wonder.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE RALESTONES ENTERTAIN AN UNOBTRUSIVE VISITOR\n\n\nVal lay trapped in an underground cavern, chained to the floor. An\nunseen monster was creeping up his prostrate body. He could feel its hot\nbreath on his cheek. With a mighty effort he broke his bonds and threw\nout his arms in an attempt to fight off his tormentor.\n\nThe morning sun was warm across his pillow, making him blink. On his\nchest stood Satan, kneading the bedclothes with his front paws and\npurring gently. From the open window came a fresh, rain-washed breeze.\n\nHaving aroused the sleeper, Satan deserted his post to hang half-way out\nthe window, intent upon the housekeeping arrangements of several birds\nwho had built in the hedges below. A moment later Val elbowed him aside\nto look out upon the morning.\n\nIt was a fine one. Wisps of mist from the bayou still hung about the\nlower garden, but the sun had already dried the brick-paved paths. A bee\nblundered past Val's nose, and he realized that it might be well to\nclose the screen hanging shutter-like outside.\n\nFrom the direction of the hidden water came the faint _putt-putt_ of a\nmotor-boat, but inside Pirate's Haven there was utter silence. As yet\nthe rest of the family were not abroad. Val dropped his pajamas in a\nhuddle by the bed and dressed leisurely, feeling very much at peace with\nthis new world. Perhaps that was the last time he was to feel so for\nmany days to come. He stole cautiously out of his room and tiptoed down\nhalls and dark stairs, wanting to be alone while he discovered Pirate's\nHaven for himself.\n\nThe Long Hall looked chilly and bleak, even though patches of sunlight\nwere fighting the usual gloom. On the hearth-stone lay a scrap of white,\ndoubtless Ricky's handkerchief. Val flung open the front door and\nstepped out on the terrace, drawing deep lungfuls of the morning air.\nThe blossoms on the morning-glory vines which wreathed the edge of the\nterrace were open to the sun, and the birds sang in the bushes below.\nSatan streaked by and disappeared into the tangle. It was suddenly very\ngood to be alive. The boy stretched luxuriously and started to explore,\nchoosing the nearest of the crazy, wandering paths which began at the\ncircle of the old carriage drive.\n\nHere was evidence of last night's storm. Wisps of Spanish moss, torn\nfrom the great live-oaks of the avenue and looking like tufts of coarse\ngray horsehair, lay in water-logged mats here and there. And in the open\nplaces, the grass, beaten flat, was just beginning to rise again.\n\nA rabbit scuttled across the path as it went down four steps of broken\nstone into a sort of glen. Here some early owner of the plantation had\nmade an irregular pool of stone to be fed by the trickle of a tiny\nspring. Frogs the size of postage-stamps leaped panic-stricken for the\nwater when Val's shadow fell across its rim. A leaden statue of the boy\nPan danced joyously on a pedestal above. Ricky would love this, thought\nher brother as he dabbled his fingers in the chill water trying to catch\nthe stem of the single lily bud.\n\nOut of nowhere came a turtle to slide into the depths of the pool. The\nsun was very warm across Val's bowed shoulders. He liked the garden,\nliked the plantation, even liked the circumstances which had brought\nthem there. Lazily he arose and turned.\n\nBy the steps down which he had come stood a slight figure in a faded\nflannel shirt and mud-streaked overalls. His bare brown feet gripped the\nstones as if to get purchase for instant flight.\n\n\"Hello,\" Val said questioningly.\n\nThe new-comer eyed young Ralestone warily and then his gaze shifted to\nthe bushes beyond.\n\n\"I'm Val Ralestone.\" Val held out his hand. To his astonishment the\nstranger's mobile lips twisted in a snarl and he edged crabwise toward\nthe bushes bordering the glen.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Val demanded sharply.\n\n\"Ah has got as much right heah as yo' all,\" the boy answered angrily.\nAnd with that he turned and slipped into a path at the far end of the\nglen.\n\nAroused, Val hurried after him to reach the bayou levee. The quarry was\nalready in midstream, wielding an efficient canoe paddle. On impulse Val\nshouted after him, but he never turned. A rifle lay across his knees and\nthere were some rusty traps in the bottom of the flimsy canoe. Then Val\nremembered that Pirate's Haven lay upon the fringe of the muskrat swamps\nwhere Cajun and American squatters still carried on the fur trade of\ntheir ancestors.\n\nBut as Val stood speeding the departure of the uninvited guest, another\ncanoe put off from the opposite shore of the bayou and came swinging\nacross toward the rough wooden landing which served the plantation. A\nround brown face grinned up at Val as a powerful negro clambered ashore.\n\n\"Is dey up at de big house now?\" he asked cheerily as he came up.\n\n\"If you mean the Ralestones, why, we got here last night,\" Val answered.\n\n\"Yo'all is Mistuh Ralestone, suh?\" He took off his wide-brimmed straw\nhat and twisted it in his oversized hands.\n\n\"I'm Valerius Ralestone. My brother Rupert is the owner.\"\n\n\"Well, Mistuh Ralestone, suh, I'se yo'all's fahmah from 'cross wata.\nMistuh LeFleah, he says dat yo'all is come to live heah agin. So mah\nwoman, she says dat Ah should see if yo'all is heah yet and does yo'all\nwant anythin'. Lucy, she's bin a-livin' heah, dat is, her mammy and\npappy and her pappy's mammy and pappy has bin heah since befo' old Massa\nRalestone done gone 'way. So Lucy, she jest nachely am oneasy 'bout\nyo'all not gettin' things comfo'ble.\"\n\n\"That is kind of her,\" Val answered heartily. \"My brother said something\nlast night about wanting to see you today, so if you'll come up to the\nhouse--\"\n\n\"I'se Sam, Mistuh Ralestone, suh. Ah done work heah quite a spell now.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" Val asked as they went up toward the house, \"did you see\nthat boy in the canoe going downstream as you crossed? I found him in\nthe garden and the only answer he would give to my questions was that he\nhad as much right there as I had. Who is he?\"\n\nThe wide smile faded from Sam's face. \"Mistuh Ralestone, suh, effen dat\nno-'count trash comes 'round heah agin, yo'all bettah jest call de\npolicemans. Dey's nothin' but poah white trash livin' down in de swamp\nplaces an' dey steals whatevah dey kin lay han' on. Was dis boy big like\nyo'all, wi' black hair an' a thin face?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Dat's de Jeems boy. He ain't got no mammy nor pappy. He lives jest like\nde wil' man wi' a li'l huntin' an' a big lot stealin'. He talk big. Say\nhe belongs in de big house, not wi' swamp folks. But jest yo'all pay no\n'tenshun to him nohow.\"\n\n\"Val! Val Ralestone! Where are you?\" Ricky's voice sounded clear through\nthe morning air.\n\n\"Coming!\" he shouted back.\n\n\"Well, make it snappy!\" she shrilled. \"The toast has been burnt twice\nand--\" But what further catastrophe had occurred her brother could not\nhear.\n\n\"Yo'all wants to git to de back do', Mistuh Ralestone, suh? Dere's a\nsho't-cut 'cross dis-a-way.\" Sam turned into a side path and Val\nfollowed.\n\nRicky was at the stove gingerly shifting a coffee-pot as her brother\nstepped into the kitchen. \"Well,\" she snapped as he entered, \"it's about\ntime you were showing up. I've simply cracked my voice trying to call\nyou, and Rupert's been talking about having the bayou dragged or\nsomething of the kind. Where have you been, anyway?\"\n\n\"Getting acquainted with our neighbors. Ricky,\" he called her attention\nto the smiling face just outside the door, \"this is Sam. He runs the\nhome farm for us. And his wife is a descendant of the Ralestone house\nfolks.\"\n\n\"Yassuh, dat's right. We's Ralestone folks, Miss 'Chanda. Mah Lucy done\nsen' me ovah to fin' out what yo'all is a-needin' done 'bout de place.\nShe was in yisteday afo' yo'all come an' seed to de dustin' an' sich--\"\n\n\"So that's why everything was so clean! That was nice of her--\"\n\n\"Yo'all is Ralestones, Miss 'Chanda. An' Lucy say dat de Ralestones am\na-goin' to fin' dis place jest ready for dem when dey come.\" He beamed\nupon them proudly. \"Lucy, she am a-goin' be heah jest as soon as she\ngits de chillens set for de day. I'se come fust so's Ah kin see wat\nMistuh Ralestone done wan' done wi dem rivah fiel's--\"\n\n\"Where is Rupert?\" Val broke in.\n\n\"Went out to see about the car. The storm last night wrecked the door of\nthe carriage house--\"\n\n\"Zat so?\" Sam's eyes went round. \"Den Ah bettah be a-gittin' out an' see\n'bout it. 'Scuse me, suh. 'Scuse me, Miss 'Chanda.\" With a jerk of his\nhead he left them. Val turned to Ricky.\n\n\"We seem to have fallen into good hands.\"\n\n\"It's my guess that his Lucy is a manager. He just does what she tells\nhim to. I wonder how he knew my name?\"\n\n\"LeFleur probably told them all about us.\"\n\n\"Isn't it odd--\" she turned off the gas, \"'Ralestone folks.'\"\n\n\"Loyalty to the Big House,\" her brother answered slowly. \"I never\nthought that it really existed out of books.\"\n\n\"It makes me feel positively feudal. Val, I was born about a hundred\nyears too late. I'd like to have been the mistress here when I could\nhave ridden out in a victoria behind two matched bays, with a coachman\nand a footman up in front and my maid on the little seat facing me.\"\n\n\"And with a Dalmatian coach-hound running behind and at least\nthree-fourths of the young bloods of the neighborhood as a mounted\nescort. I know. But those days are gone forever. Which leads me to\nanother subject. What are we going to do today?\"\n\n\"The dishes, for one thing,\" Ricky began ticking the items off on her\nfingers, \"and then the beds. This afternoon Rupert wants us--that is,\nyou and me--to drive to town and do some errands.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, the list you two made out last night. Well, now that that's\nall settled, suppose we have some breakfast. Has Rupert been fed or is\nhe thinking of going on a diet?\"\n\n\"He'll be in--\"\n\n\"Said she with perfect faith. All of which does not satisfy the pangs of\nhunger.\"\n\n\"Where's Lovey?\"\n\n\"If you are using that sickening name to refer to Satan--he's\nout--hunting, probably. The last I saw of him he was shooting head first\nfor a sort of bird apartment house over to the left of the front door.\nHere's Rupert. Now maybe we may eat.\"\n\n\"I've got something to tell you,\" hissed Ricky as the missing member of\nthe clan banged the screen door behind him. Having so aroused Val's\ncuriosity, she demurely went around the table to pour the coffee.\n\n\"How's the carriage house?\" Val asked.\n\n\"Sam thinks he can fix it with some of that lumber piled out back of the\nold smoke-house.\" Rupert reached for a piece of toast. \"What do you\nthink of our family retainer?\"\n\n\"Seems a good chap.\"\n\n\"LeFleur says one of the best. Possesses a spark of ambition and is\nreally trying to make a go of the farm, which is more than most of them\ndo around here. His wife, by all accounts, is a wonder. Used to be the\ncook-housekeeper here when the Rafaels had the place. LeFleur still\ntalks about the two meals he ate here then. Sam tells me that she is\nplanning to take us in hand.\"\n\n\"But we can't afford--\" began Ricky.\n\n\"I gathered that money does not come into the question. The lady is\nrather strong-willed. So, Ricky,\" he laughed, \"we'll leave you two to\nfight it out. But Lucy may be able to find us a laundress.\"\n\n\"Which reminds me,\" Ricky took a crumpled piece of white cloth from her\npocket, \"if this is yours, Rupert, you deserve to do your own washing. I\ndon't know what you've got on it; looks like oil.\"\n\nHe took it from her and straightened out a handkerchief.\n\n\"Not guilty this time. Ask little brother here.\" He passed over the\ndirty linen square. It was plain white--or it had been white before\nthree large black splotches had colored it--without an initial or\ncolored edge.\n\n\"I think he's prevaricating, Ricky,\" Val protested. \"This isn't mine.\nI'm down to one thin dozen and those are the ones you gave me last\nChristmas. They have my initials on.\"\n\nRicky took back the disputed square. \"That's funny. It certainly isn't\nmine. I'm sure one of you must be mistaken.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Rupert.\n\n\"Because I found it on the hearth-stone in the hall this morning. It\nwasn't there last night or one of us would have seen it and picked it\nup, 'cause it was right there in plain sight.\"\n\n\"Sure it isn't yours, Val?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Positive.\"\n\n\"Queer,\" murmured Rupert and reached for it again. \"It's a good quality\nof linen and it's almost new.\" He held it to his nose. \"That's oil on\nit. But how--?\"\n\n\"I wonder--\" Val mused.\n\n\"What do you know?\" asked Ricky.\n\n\"Well--Oh, it isn't possible. He wouldn't carry a handkerchief,\" her\nbrother said half to himself.\n\n\"Who wouldn't?\" asked Rupert. Then Val told them of his meeting with the\nboy Jeems and what Sam had had to say of him.\n\n\"Don't know whether I exactly like this.\" Rupert folded the mysterious\nsquare of stained linen. \"As you say, Val, a boy like that would hardly\ncarry a handkerchief. Also, you met him in the garden, while--\"\n\n\"The person who left that was in this house last night!\" finished Ricky.\n\"And I don't like that!\"\n\n\"The door was locked and bolted when I came down this morning,\" Val\nobserved.\n\nRupert nodded. \"Yes, I distinctly remember doing that before I went up\nto bed last night. But when I was going around the house this morning I\ndiscovered that there are French doors opening from the old ball-room to\nthe terrace, and I didn't inspect their fastening last night.\"\n\n\"But who would want to come in here? There are no valuables left except\nfurniture. And it would take three or four men and a truck to collect\nthat. I don't see what he was after,\" puzzled Ricky.\n\nRupert arose from the table. \"We have, it seems, a mystery on our hands.\nIf you want to amuse yourselves, my children, here's the first clue.\nI've got to get back to the carriage house and my labors there.\"\n\nHe dropped the handkerchief on the table and left. Ricky reached for the\n\"clue.\" \"Awfully casual about it, isn't he?\" she said. \"Just the same, I\nbelieve that this is a clue and I know what our visitor was after, too,\"\nshe finished triumphantly.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The treasure Richard Ralestone hid when the Yankee raiders came.\"\n\n\"Well, if our unknown visitor has as little in the way of clues as we\nhave, he'll be a long time finding it.\"\n\n\"And we're going to beat him to it! It's somewhere in the Hall, and the\nsecret--\"\n\n\"See here,\" Val interrupted her, \"what were you about to tell me when\nRupert came in?\"\n\nShe put the handkerchief in the breast pocket of her sport dress,\nbuttoning the flap over it.\n\n\"Rupert's got a secret.\"\n\n\"What kind?\"\n\n\"It has to do with those two brief-cases of his. You know, the ones he\nwas so particular about all the way down here?\"\n\nVal nodded. Those bulging brief-cases had apparently contained the\ndearest of his roving brother's possessions, judging from the way Rupert\nhad fussed if they were a second out of his sight.\n\n\"This morning when I came downstairs,\" Ricky continued, \"he was sneaking\nthem into that little side room off the dining-room corridor, the one\nwhich used to be the old plantation office. And when he came out and saw\nme standing there, he deliberately turned around and locked the door!\"\n\n\"Whew!\" Val commented.\n\n\"Yes, I felt that way too. So I simply asked him what he was doing and\nhe made some silly remark about Bluebeard's chamber. He means to keep\nhis old secret, too, 'cause he put the key on his key-ring when he\ndidn't know I was watching him.\"\n\n\"This is not the place for a rest cure,\" her brother observed as he\nstarted to scrape and stack the dishes. \"First someone unknown leaves\nhis handkerchief for a calling card and then Rupert goes Fu Manchu on\nus. To say nothing of the rugged and unfriendly son of the soil whom I\nfound bumping around the garden where he had no business to be.\"\n\n\"What was he like anyway?\" asked his sister as she dipped soap flakes\ninto the dish-water with a liberal hand.\n\n\"Oh, thin, and awfully brown. But not bad looking if it weren't for his\nmouth and that scowl of his. And he very distinctly doesn't like us.\nAbout my build, but quicker on his feet, tough looking. I wouldn't care\nto try to stop him doing anything he wanted to do.\"\n\n\"My dear, are you describing Clark Gable or someone you met in our\ngarden this morning?\" she demanded sweetly.\n\n\"Very well,\" Val retorted huffily into the depths of the oatmeal pan he\nwas wiping, \"you catch him next time.\"\n\n\"I will,\" was her serene answer as she wrung out the dish-cloth.\n\nThey went on to the upstairs work and Val received his first lesson in\nthe art of bed-making under his sister's extremely critical tuition. It\nseemed that corners must be square and that dreadful things were likely\nto happen when wrinkles were not smoothed out. This exercise led them\nnaturally to unpacking the remainder of the hand baggage and putting\nthings away. It was after ten before Val came downstairs crab-fashion,\nwiping off each step behind him as he came with one of Ricky's three\ndust-cloths.\n\nHe paused on the landing to pull back the tapestry curtain and open the\nwindows above the alcove seat, letting in the freshness of the morning\nto rout some of the dank chill of the hall. Kneeling there, he watched\nRupert come around the house. Rupert had shed his coat and his sleeves\nwere rolled up almost to his shoulders. There was a streak of black\nacross his cheek and a large rip almost separated the collar from his\nshirt. Although he looked hot, cross, and tired, more like a day-laborer\nthan a gentleman plantation owner whose ancestors had always \"planted\nfrom the saddle,\" his stride had a certain buoyancy which it had lacked\nthe day before.\n\nWith an idea of escaping Ricky by joining his brother, Val hurried\ndownstairs and headed kitchenward. But his sister was there before him\nlooking over a collection of knives of various lengths.\n\n\"Preparing for a little murder or two?\" Val asked casually.\n\nShe jumped and dropped a paring knife.\n\n\"Val, don't do that! I wish you'd whistle or something while you're\nwalking around in those tennis shoes. I can't hear you move. I'm looking\nfor something to cut flowers with. There don't seem to be any scissors\nexcept mine and I'm not going to use those.\"\n\n\"Take dat, Miss 'Chanda.\" A fat black hand motioned toward the paring\nknife.\n\nJust within the kitchen door stood a wide, a very wide, Negro woman. Her\nneat print dress was stiff with starch from a recent washing, and round\ngold hoops swung proudly from her ears. Her black hair, straightened by\nmain force of arm, had been set again in stiff, corrugated waves of\nextreme fashion, but her broad placid face was both kind and serene.\n\n\"I'se Lucy,\" she stated, thoroughly at her ease. \"An' dis,\" she reached\nan arm behind her, pulling forth a girl at least ten shades lighter and\nthirty-five shades thinner, \"is mah sistah's onliest gal-chil',\nLetty-Lou. Mak' yo' mannahs, Letty. Does yo' wan' Miss 'Chanda to think\nyo' is a know-nothin' outa de swamp?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"_I'se Lucy,\" she stated, thoroughly at her ease. \"An'\ndis is Letty-Lou._\"]\n\nThus sternly admonished, Letty-Lou ducked her head shyly and murmured\nsomething in a die-away voice.\n\n\"Letty-Lou,\" announced her aunt, \"is com' to do fo' yo'all, Miss\n'Chanda. I'se larn'd her good how to do fo' ladies. She is good at\nscrubbin' an' cleanin' an sich. Ah done train'd her mahse'f.\"\n\nLetty-Lou looked at the floor and twisted her thin hands behind her\nback.\n\n\"But,\" protested Ricky, \"we're not planning to have anyone do for us,\nLucy.\"\n\n\"Dat's all right, Miss 'Chanda. Yo'all's not gittin' a know-nothin'.\nLetty-Lou, she knows her work. She kin cook right good.\"\n\n\"We can't take her,\" Val backed up Ricky. \"You must understand, Lucy,\nthat we don't have much money and we can't pay for--\"\n\n\"Pay fo'!\" Lucy's indignant sniff reduced him to his extremely\nunimportant place. \"We's not talkin' 'bout pay workin', Mistuh\nRalestone. Letty-Lou don' git no pay but her eatments. 'Co'se, effen\nMiss 'Chanda wanna give her some ole clo's now an' den, she kin tak'\ndem. Letty-Lou, she don' hav' to git her a pay-work job, her pappy mak's\nhim a good livin'. But Miss 'Chanda ain' a-goin' to tak' keer dis big\nhous' all by herself wit' her lil' han's dere. We's Ralestone folks.\nLetty-Lou, yo' gits on youah ap'on an' gits to work.\"\n\n\"But we can't let her,\" Ricky raised her last protest.\n\n\"Miss 'Chanda, we's Ralestone folks. Mah gran' pappy Bob was own man to\nMassa Miles Ralestone. He fit in de wah longside o' Massa Miles. An' wen\nde wah was done finish'd, dem two com' home to-gethah. Den Massa Miles,\nhe call mah gran'pappy in an' say, 'Bob, yo'all is free an' I'se a\nruinated man. Heah is fiv' dollahs gol' money an' yo' kin hav' youah\nhoss.' An' Bob, he say, 'Cap'n Miles, dese heah Yankees done said I'se\nfree but dey ain't done said dat I ain't a Ralestone man. W'at time does\nyo'all wan' breakfas' in de mornin'?' An' wen Massa Miles wen' no'th to\nmak' his fo'tune, he told Bob, 'Bob, I'se leavin' dis heah hous' in\nyouah keer.' An', Miss 'Chanda, we done look aftah Pirate's Haven evah\nsince, mah gran'pappy, mah pappy, Sam an' me.\"\n\nRicky held out her hand. \"I'm sorry, Lucy. You see, we don't understand\nvery well, we've been away so long.\"\n\nLucy touched Ricky's hand and then, for all her weight, bobbed a curtsy.\n\"Dat's all right, Miss 'Chanda, yo' is ouah folks.\"\n\nLetty-Lou stayed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nPISTOLS FOR TWO--COFFEE FOR ONE\n\n\nVal braced himself against the back of the roadster's seat and struggled\nto hold the car to a road which was hardly more than a cart track. Twice\nsince Ricky and he had left Pirate's Haven they had narrowly escaped\nbeing bogged in the mud which had worked up through the thin crust of\ngravel on the surface.\n\nTo the south lay the old cypress swamps, dark glens of rotting wood and\nsprawling vines. A spur of this unsavory no-man's land ran close along\nthe road, and looking into it one could almost believe, fancied Val, in\nthe legends told by the early French explorers concerning the giant\nmonsters who were supposed to haunt the swamps and wild lands at the\nmouth of the Mississippi. He would not have been surprised to see a\nbrontosaurus peeking coyly down at him from twenty feet or so of neck.\nIt was just the sort of place any self-respecting brontosaurus would\nhave wallowed in.\n\nBut at last they won free from that place of cold and dank odors.\nPassing through Chalmette, they struck the main highway. From then on it\nwas simple enough. St. Bernard Highway led into St. Claude Avenue and\nthat melted into North Rampart street, one of the boundaries of the old\nFrench city.\n\n\"Can't we go slower?\" complained Ricky. \"I'd like to see some of the\ncity without getting a crick in my neck from looking over my shoulder.\nWatch out for St. Anne Street. That's one corner of Beauregarde Square,\nthe old Congo Square--\"\n\n\"Where the slaves used to dance on Sundays before the war. I know; I've\nread just as many guide-books as you have. But there is such a thing as\nobstructing traffic. Also we have about a million and one things to do\nthis afternoon. We can explore later. Here we are; Bienville Avenue. No,\nI will _not_ stop so that you can see that antique store. Six blocks to\nthe right,\" Val reminded himself.\n\n\"Val, that was the Absinthe House we just passed!\"\n\n\"Yes? Well, it would have been better for a certain ancestor of ours if\nhe had passed it, too. That was Jean Lafitte's headquarters at one time.\nExchange Street--the next is ours.\"\n\nThey turned into Chartres Street and pulled up in the next block at the\ncorner of Iberville. A four-story house coated with grayish plaster, its\nwindows framed with faded green shutters and its door painted the same\nmisty color, confronted them. There was a tiny shop on the first floor.\n\nA weathered sign over the door announced that Bonfils et Cie. did\nbusiness within, behind the streaked and bluish glass of the small\ncurved window-panes. But what business Bonfils and Company conducted was\nleft entirely to the imagination of the passer-by. Val locked the\nroadster and took from Ricky the long legal-looking envelope which\nRupert had given them to deliver to Mr. LeFleur.\n\nRicky was staring in a puzzled manner at the shop when her brother took\nher by the arm. \"Are you sure that you have the right place? This\ndoesn't look like an office to me.\"\n\n\"We have to go around to the courtyard entrance. LeFleur occupies the\nsecond floor.\"\n\nA small wooden door, reinforced with hinges of hand-wrought iron, opened\nbefore them, making them free of a courtyard paved with flagstones. In\nthe center a tall tree shaded the flower bed at its foot and threw\nshadows upon the first of the steps leading to the upper floors. The\nRalestones frankly stared about them. This was the first house of the\nFrench Quarter they had seen, although their name might have admitted\nthem to several closely guarded Creole strongholds. LeFleur's house\nfollowed a pattern common to the old city. The lower floor fronting on\nthe street was in use only as a shop or store-room. In the early days\neach shopkeeper lived above his place of business and rented the third\nand fourth floors to aristocrats in from their plantations for the\nfashionable season.\n\nA long, narrow ell ran back from the main part of the house to form one\nside of the courtyard. The ground floor of this contained the old slave\nquarters and kitchens, while the second was cut into bedrooms which had\nhoused the young men of the family so that they could come and go at\nwill without disturbing the more sedate members of the household. These\nsmall rooms were now in use as the offices of Mr. LeFleur. From the\nbalcony, running along the ell, onto which each room opened, one could\nlook down into the courtyard. It was on this balcony that the lawyer met\nthem with outstretched hands after they had given their names to his\ndark, languid young clerk.\n\n\"But this is good of you!\" Ren\u00e9 LeFleur beamed on them impartially. He\nwas a small, plumpish, round-faced man in his early forties, who spoke\nin perpetual italics. His eyebrows, arched over-generously by Nature,\ngave him a look of never-ending astonishment at the world and all its\nworks. But his genial smile was kindness itself. Unaccustomed as Val was\nto sudden enthusiasms, he found himself liking Ren\u00e9 LeFleur almost\nbefore his hand gripped Val's.\n\n\"Miss Ralestone, it is a pleasure, a very great pleasure, to see you\nhere! And this,\" he turned to Val, \"this must be that brother Valerius\nboth you and Mr. Ralestone spoke so much of during our meeting in New\nYork. You have safely recovered from that most unfortunate accident, Mr.\nRalestone? But of course, your presence here is my answer. And how do\nyou like Louisiana, Miss Ralestone?\" His eyes behind his gold-rimmed\neyeglasses sparkled as he tilted his head a fraction toward Ricky as if\nto hear the clearer.\n\n\"Well enough. Though we've seen very little of it yet, Mr. LeFleur.\"\n\n\"When you have seen Pirate's Haven,\" he replied, \"you have seen much of\nLouisiana.\"\n\n\"But we're forgetting our manners!\" exclaimed the girl. \"We want to\nthank you for everything you've done for us. Rupert said to tell you\nthat while he doesn't care for beans as a rule, the beans we found in\nour cupboard were very superior beans.\"\n\nMr. LeFleur hooted with laughter like a small boy. \"He is droll, is that\nbrother of yours. And has Sam been to see you?\"\n\n\"Sam and--Lucy,\" answered Ricky with emphasis. \"Lucy has decided to take\nus in hand. She has installed Letty-Lou over our protests.\"\n\nThe little lawyer nodded complacently. \"Yes, Lucy will take care of you.\nShe is a master housekeeper and cook--ah!\" His eyes rolled upward. \"And\nMr. Ralestone, how is he?\"\n\n\"All right. He's going over the farm with Sam this afternoon. We were\nsent in his place to give you the papers he spoke to you about.\"\n\nAt Ricky's answer, Val held out the envelope he had carried. To their\njoint surprise, LeFleur pounced upon it and withdrew to the window of\nthe room into which he had conducted them. There he spread out the four\nsheets of yellowed paper which the envelope had contained.\n\n\"What were we carrying?\" whispered Ricky. \"Part of Rupert's deep, dark\nsecret?\"\n\n\"No,\" her brother hissed back, \"those are the plans of the Patagonian\nfort which were stolen from the Russian Embassy last Thursday by the\nbeautiful woman spy disguised with a long green beard. You know, the\nproper first chapter of an international espionage thriller. You are the\ndumb but beautiful newspaper reporter on the scent, and I--\"\n\n\"The even dumber G-man who spends most of his time running three steps\nahead of Fu Chew Chow and his gang of oriental demons. In the second\nchapter--\"\n\nBut a glance at Mr. LeFleur's face as he turned away from the window put\nan end to their nonsense. Gone was his smile, his beaming good-will\ntoward the world. He seemed a little tired, a trifle stooped. \"Not here\nthen,\" he said slowly to himself as he slipped the papers back into the\nenvelope.\n\n\"Mr. Valerius,\" he looked up at the boy very seriously, \"the LeFleurs\nhave served the Ralestones, acting as their men of business, for over a\nhundred years. We owe your family a great debt. When young Denys LeFleur\nwas shipped over here to New Orleans under false accusation of his\nenemies, the first Richard Ralestone became his patron. He helped the\nboy salvage something from the wreck of the LeFleur fortunes in France\nto start anew in a decent profession under tolerable surroundings, when\nothers of his kind died miserably as beggars on the mud flats. Twice\nbefore have we been forced to be the bearers of ill news, but--\" he\nshrugged, \"that was in the past. This lies in the future.\"\n\n\"What does?\" asked Ricky.\n\n\"It is such a tangle,\" he said, running his hand through his short,\ngray-streaked hair. \"A tangle such as lawyers are supposed to delight\nin. But they don't, I assure you that they don't, Miss Ralestone. Not if\nthey have their client's interest at heart. You know, of course, of the\nmissing Ralestone--Roderick?\"\n\nRicky and Val both nodded. Mr. LeFleur spread out his plump hands in a\nqueer little gesture as if he were pushing something away. \"This whole\nunfortunate business begins with him. As far as we know today, he and\nhis brother were co-owners of Pirate's Haven. When young Roderick\ndisappeared, he was still part owner. Although he was presumed dead, he\nwas never lawfully declared so. Pirate's Haven was simply assumed to be\nthe property of your branch of the family.\"\n\n\"Our branch of the family?\" Val echoed him. \"Do you mean that some\ndescendant of Roderick has appeared to put in a claim?\"\n\n\"That is the problem. Three days ago a man came to my office. He said\nthat he is the direct descendant of Roderick Ralestone and that he can\nproduce proof of that fact.\"\n\n\"And he wants his share of the estate?\" asked Ricky shrewdly.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He can keep on wanting,\" Val said shortly. \"We've nothing to give.\"\n\n\"There's Pirate's Haven,\" pointed out Mr. LeFleur.\n\n\"But he can't--\" Ricky's hand closed about her brother's wrist.\n\n\"Naturally he can't take it,\" Val assured her hotly. \"Pirate's Haven is\nours. This looks to me like blackmail. He'll threaten to stir up a lot\nof trouble unless we buy him off.\"\n\nMr. LeFleur nodded. \"That is perhaps the motive behind it all.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Val forced a laugh, \"then he loses. We haven't the money to buy\nhim off.\"\n\n\"Neither have you the money to fight a case through the courts, Mr.\nValerius,\" answered the lawyer soberly.\n\n\"But there is some chance, there must be!\" urged Ricky.\n\n\"I submitted the full case to Mr. John Stanton yesterday--Mr. Stanton is\nour local authority on cases of this type. He has informed me that there\nis a single ray of hope. Frankly, I find this claimant a dubious person,\nbut a shrewd one. He knows that he has the advantage now, but should we\ngain the upper hand, we could, I believe, rid ourselves of him. Our\nchance lies in the past. This was first a French and then a Spanish\ncolony. Under both rules the law of primogeniture sometimes held force.\nThat is, an estate passed to the eldest son of a family. Your estate was\nsuch a one. In fact, we possess in this very office old charters and\npapers which state that the property was entailed after the European\ncustom. If that were so, the courts might declare that the elder of the\ntwins born in 1788 was the sole owner of Pirate's Haven.\n\n\"But which of the twin brothers was the elder? You will say at once,\nRichard. But your rival will say Roderick. And there is no proof. For in\nthe spring, two months after the birth of the boys, most of the family\npapers were destroyed in the great fire which almost wiped out the city\nand burned the Ralestone town house. There is no birth record in\nexistence. I appealed to your brother to return to me these papers which\nMiles Ralestone took north with him after the war. You returned them\ntoday but there was nothing in them of any value to this case.\n\n\"However, if you can find such proof, that Richard Ralestone was the\nelder and thus the legal heir under the laws of Spain, then we shall\nhave a solid fact upon which to base our fight.\"\n\n\"There is such a proof,\" began Ricky slowly.\n\n\"What? Where?\" demanded Mr. LeFleur.\n\n\"Don't you remember, Val,\" she turned to him, \"what Rupert said about\nthe Luck last night--that the names of the heirs were engraved upon its\nblade? We'll have to find the Luck! We'll just have to!\"\n\n\"But Roderick took the Luck with him. And if it's still in existence,\nthis rival will have it now,\" her brother reminded her.\n\n\"Yes, of course, I was forgetting--\" her voice trailed off into silence\nand Val stared at her with a dropped jaw. Such a quick change of manner\nwas totally unlike Ricky. \"Yes,\" she repeated slowly and distinctly, \"I\nguess we're the losers--\"\n\n\"For Pete's sake--\" he began hotly and then he saw her hand making\nfurious motions in his direction from behind the screen of her large\npurse. \"Well, I suppose we are in a hole.\" He managed to mend his tone a\nfraction. \"Rupert will probably be in to see you tomorrow, Mr. LeFleur.\"\n\n\"It would be well for him to become acquainted with the whole matter as\nquickly as possible,\" agreed the unhappy Creole. \"You may tell Mr.\nRalestone that I am, of course, having this claimant thoroughly\ninvestigated. We shall have to wait and see. Time is a big factor,\" he\nmurmured as if to himself.\n\nRicky smiled brightly. There was a sort of eagerness about her, as if\nshe were wild to be off. \"Then we'll say good-bye for the present, Mr.\nLeFleur. And may I mention again how much we have appreciated your\nthoughtfulness?\"\n\nRen\u00e9 LeFleur aroused himself. \"But it was a pleasure, a very great\npleasure, Miss Ralestone. You are returning to Pirate's Haven now?\"\n\n\"Well--\" she hesitated. Mystified at what lay behind her unexplainable\nactions, Val could only stand and listen. \"We did have some errands. Of\ncourse, this news--\"\n\nLeFleur gestured widely. \"But it will come all right. It must. There are\npapers somewhere.\"\n\nFirmly Ricky broke away from more protracted farewells. As the\nRalestones turned out of the courtyard into which their host had\nconducted them, Val matched his step with hers.\n\n\"Well? What's the matter?\" he demanded.\n\n\"We had an eavesdropper.\"\n\nVal stopped short. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I was facing the door to the balcony. There was the shadow of a head on\nthe floor. When you spoke about Rick having the sword, it went away--the\nshadow, I mean. But someone had been listening and now he knows about\nthe Luck and what it means to us.\"\n\nAiming a kick at the nearest tire of the roadster, Val regarded the\nmud-stained rubber moodily. \"Fine mess!\"\n\n\"Yes, isn't it? And there seems to be no loose end to the thing,\" Ricky\nprotested. \"It's like holding a big tangle of wool and being told to\nhave it all straightened out before night--the plot of a fairy-tale. We\nhave so many odd sections but no ends. There's that boy in the garden\nthis morning who said that he has as much right at Pirate's Haven as we\nhave, and then there's that handkerchief, and now this man who claims\nhalf the estate--\"\n\n\"And our mysterious listener,\" finished her brother. \"What shall we do\nnow? Go home?\"\n\n\"No. We might as well do the errands.\" She seated herself in the car.\n\"Val--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I know one thing.\" She leaned toward him and her eyes shone green as\nthey did when she was excited or greatly troubled. \"We aren't going to\nlet go of our tangle until we do find an end. We _are_ the Ralestones of\nPirate's Haven and we are going to continue to be the Ralestones of\nPirate's Haven.\"\n\n\"In spite of the enemy? I agree.\" Val stepped on the starter. \"You know,\na hundred years ago there would have been a very simple remedy for this\nrival-claimant business.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Pistols for two--coffee for one. Rupert or I would have met him out at\nthe dueling oaks and that would have been the end of him.\"\n\n\"Or you. But dueling--here!\"\n\n\"Very common. The finest fencing masters on the North American continent\nplied their trade here. Why, one, Pepe Llula, the most famous duelist of\nhis time, became the guardian of a cemetery just so, as gossip rumored,\nhe could have some place to bury his opponents.\n\n\"Then on the other hand, if dueling were too risky, we might have had\nhim voodooed, had we lived back in the good old days. Paid that voodoo\nqueen--what was her name? Marie something or other--to put a curse on\nhim so he'd just wither away.\"\n\n\"And serve him right, too.\" Ricky stared straight before her. \"I don't\nknow how you feel about it, but I'm not going to give up Pirate's Haven\nwithout a fight. It's--it's the first real home we've ever had. Rupert's\nolder; he's spent his time traveling and seeing the world; it may not\nmean so much to him. But you and I, Val--You know what it's been like!\nSchools, and spending the holidays with aunts or in those frightful\ncamps, never getting a chance to be together. We can't--we just can't\nhave this only to lose it again. We can't!\" her voice broke.\n\n\"So we won't.\"\n\n\"Val, when you say things like that, I can almost believe them. If--if\nwe do lose, let's stick together this time. Promise?\" her voice lifted\nin an effort toward lightness.\n\n\"I promise. After this it will be the two of us together. Do you know,\nI've never really had a chance to get acquainted with my very\ngood-looking sister.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"I can't very well curtsy while sitting down in here, but\n'thank yuh for them purty words, stranger.' And now for the express\nstation. Then you are to stop at the Southeastern News Association\nheadquarters for something of Rupert's and--\"\n\nThe afternoon went quickly enough. They despatched the rest of their\npossessions from the express station to Pirate's Haven, went on a round\nof miscellaneous shopping, picked up a weighty box at the News\nAssociation, and ended up at five o'clock by visiting that institution\nof New Orleans, a coffee-house. Ricky was earnestly peeking into one of\nher ten or so small bags. They had parked the car and Val complained\nthat he had become a sort of packhorse, and anything but patient one.\n\n\"What if your feet do hurt,\" his sister said wearily as she closed the\nbag and reached for another. \"So do mine. These sidewalks feel like\nred-hot iron. I'll bet I could do one of those fakir tricks where you're\nsupposed to walk over red-hot plowshares.\"\n\n\"Not only my feet but also my backbone is protesting. Whether you have\nreached the end of that _Anthony Adverse_ of a shopping list or not,\nwe're going home! And what _are_ you looking for? You've opened all\nthose bags at least twice and dropped no less than three on the floor\neach time,\" he snapped irritably.\n\n\"My pralines. I'm sure I gave them to you to carry. I've heard of New\nOrleans pralines all my life, so I got some today and now they've\ndisappeared.\"\n\n\"They were probably included in that last arm-load of parcels I stowed\nin the car. Are you through?\"\n\nRicky looked into her coffee-cup. \"It's empty, so I guess I am. Where is\nthe car? I'm so lost I don't know where we are now.\"\n\n\"We left it about three blocks away on the sunny side of the street,\"\nVal informed her with the relish of one who is thoroughly tired of his\npresent existence. \"If this is your usual behavior on a shopping trip,\nRupert may bring you in the next time. Half an hour to choose a\ntoothbrush-mug in the ten-cent store!\"\n\n\"For a person who spends a good fifteen minutes matching a tie and a\nhandkerchief,\" sniffed Ricky as she rose, \"you're in a hurry to\ncriticize others.\"\n\n\"Come _on_!\" her brother almost howled as he scooped up the packages.\n\n\"Anyway, we won't have to get supper or wash the dishes or anything.\"\nShe pulled off her hat as she settled herself in the car. \"It's so\nbeastly hot, but it'll be cooler at home. Do you suppose we could go\nswimming in the bayou?\"\n\n\"I don't see why not.\" Val guided the roadster into a side street.\n\"Where's that map of the city? We've got to see how to get back on to\nNorth Rampart from here.\"\n\n\"I'll look.\" Ricky bent her head and so she did not see the two figures\nwalking close together and so rapt in conversation that the one on the\ncurb side brushed against a lamp-post.\n\nNow just what, considered Val, was the slim young clerk from Mr.\nLeFleur's office telling that red-faced man in the too-snug suit? He\nwould have liked to have overheard a word or two. Perhaps he had become\nunduly suspicious but--he had his doubts.\n\n\"We turn left at the next corner,\" said Ricky.\n\nVal changed gears and drove on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHEIR TENANT DISCOVERS THE RALESTONES\n\n\nVal stood on the small ornamental bridge pitching twigs down into the\ntiny garden brook. A moody frown creased his forehead. Under his feet\nlay a pair of pruning-shears he had borrowed from Sam with the intention\nof doing something about the jungle which surrounded Pirate's Haven on\nthree sides. That is, he had intended doing something, but now--\n\n\"Penny for your thoughts.\"\n\n\"Lady,\" he answered dismally without turning around, \"you can have a\nbushel of them for less than that.\"\n\n\"There is a neat expression which describes you beautifully at this\nmoment,\" commented Ricky as she came up beside her brother. \"Have you\never heard of a 'sour puss?\"\n\n\"Several times. Oh, what's the use!\" Val kicked at a long twig. A warm\nwind brought in its hold the heavy scent of flowering bushes and trees.\nHis shirt clung to his shoulders damply. It was hot even in the shade of\nthe oaks. Rupert had gone to town to see LeFleur and hear the worst, so\nthat Pirate's Haven, save for themselves and Letty-Lou, was deserted.\n\n\"Come on,\" Ricky's arm slid through his, \"let's explore. Think of\nit--we've been here two whole days and we don't know yet what our back\nyard looks like. Rupert says that our land runs clear down into the\nswamp. Let's go see.\"\n\n\"But I was going to--\" He made a feeble beginning toward stooping for\nthe pruning-shears.\n\n\"Val Ralestone, nobody can work outdoors in this heat, and you know it.\nNow come on. Bring those with you and we'll leave them in the carriage\nhouse as we pass it. You know,\" she continued as they went along the\npath, \"the trouble with us is that we haven't enough to do. What we need\nis a good old-fashioned job.\"\n\n\"I thought we were going to be treasure hunters,\" he protested\nlaughingly.\n\n\"That's merely a side-line. I'm talking about the real thing, something\nwhich will pay us cash money on Saturday nights or thereabout.\"\n\n\"Well, we can both use a typewriter fairly satisfactorily,\" Val offered.\n\"But as you are the world's worst speller and I am apt to become\nentangled in my commas, I can't see us the shining lights of any\nefficient office. And while we've had expensive educations, we haven't\nhad practical ones. So what do we do now?\"\n\n\"We sit down and think of one thing we're really good at doing and\nthen--Val, what is that?\" She pointed dramatically at a mound of brick\novergrown with vines. To their right and left stretched a row of\ntumble-down cabins, some with the roofs totally gone and the doors\nfallen from the hinges.\n\n\"The old plantation bake oven, I should say. This must be what's left of\nthe slave quarters. But where's the carriage house?\"\n\n\"It must be around the other side of the big house. Let's try that\ndirection anyway. But I think you'd better go first and do some\nchopping. This dress may be a poor thing but it's my own and likely to\nbe for some time to come. And short of doing a sort of snake act, I\ndon't see how we're going to get through there.\"\n\nVal applied the shears ruthlessly to vine and bush alike, glad to find\nsomething to attack. The weight of his depression was still upon him. It\nwas all very well for Ricky to talk so lightly of getting a job, but\ntalk would never put butter on their bread--if they could afford bread.\n\n\"You certainly have done a fine job of ruining that!\"\n\nVal surpassed Ricky's jump by a good inch. By the old bake oven stood a\nwoman. A disreputable straw hat with a raveled brim was pulled down over\nher untidy honey-colored hair and she was rolling up the sleeves of a\nstained smock to bare round brown arms.\n\n\"It's very plain to the eye that you're no gardener,\" she continued\npleasantly. \"And may I ask who you are and what you are doing here? This\nplace is not open to trespassers, you know.\"\n\n\"We did think we would explore,\" answered Ricky meekly. \"You see, this\nall belongs to my brother.\" She swept her hand about in a wide circle.\n\n\"And just who is he?\"\n\n\"Rupert Ralestone of Pirate's Haven.\"\n\n\"Good--!\" Their questioner's hand flew to cover her mouth, and at the\ncomic look of dismay which appeared on her face, Ricky's laugh sounded.\nA moment later the stranger joined in her mirth.\n\n\"And here I thought that I was being oh so helpful to an absent\nlandlord,\" she chuckled. \"And this brother of yours is _my_ landlord!\"\n\n\"How--? Why, we didn't know that.\"\n\n\"I've rented your old overseer's house and am using it for my studio. By\nthe way, introductions are in order, I believe. I am Charity Biglow,\nfrom Boston as you might guess. Only beans and the Bunker Hill Monument\nare more Boston than the Biglows.\"\n\n\"I'm Richanda Ralestone and this is my brother Valerius.\"\n\nMiss Biglow grinned cheerfully at Val. \"That won't do, you know; too\nromantic by far. I once read a sword-and-cloak romance in which the hero\nanswered to the name of Valerius.\"\n\n\"I haven't a cloak nor a sword and my friends generally call me Val, so\nI hope I'm acceptable,\" he grinned back at her.\n\n\"Indeed you are--both of you. And what are you doing now?\"\n\n\"Trying to find a building known as the carriage house. I'm beginning to\nbelieve that its existence is wholly mythical,\" Val replied.\n\n\"It's over there, simply yards from the direction in which you're\nheading. But suppose you come and visit me instead. Really, as part\nlandlords, you should be looking into the condition of your rentable\nproperty.\"\n\nShe turned briskly to the left down the lane on which were located the\nslave cabins and guided the Ralestones along a brick-paved path into a\nclearing where stood a small house of typical plantation style. The\nlower story was of stone with steep steps leading to a balcony which ran\ncompletely around the second floor of the house.\n\nAs they reached the balcony she pulled off her hat and threw it in the\ngeneral direction of a cane settee. Without that wreck of a hat, with\nthe curls of her long bob flowing free, she looked years younger.\n\n\"Make yourselves thoroughly at home. After all, this is your house, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"But we didn't,\" protested Ricky. \"Mr. LeFleur didn't tell us a thing\nabout you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he didn't know.\" Charity Biglow was pinning back her curls. \"I\nrented from Harrison.\"\n\n\"Like the bathroom,\" Val murmured and looked up to find them staring at\nhim. \"Oh, I just meant that you were another improvement that he had\ninstalled,\" he stammered. Miss Biglow nodded in a satisfied sort of way.\n\"Spoken like a true southern gentleman, though I don't think in the old\ndays that bathrooms would have crept into a compliment paid to a lady.\nNow I did have some lemonade--if you will excuse me,\" and she was gone\ninto the house.\n\nRicky smiled. \"I like our tenant,\" she said softly.\n\n\"You don't expect me to disagree with that, do you?\" her brother had\njust time enough to ask before their hostess appeared again complete\nwith tray, glasses, and a filled pitcher which gave forth the refreshing\nsound of clinking ice. And after her paraded an old friend of theirs,\ntail proudly erect. \"There's our cat!\" cried Ricky.\n\nVal snapped his fingers. \"Here, Satan.\"\n\nAfter staring round-eyed at both of them, the cat crossed casually to\nthe settee and proceeded to sharpen his claws.\n\n\"Well, I like that! After I shared my bed with the brute, even though I\ndidn't know it until the next morning,\" Val exploded.\n\n\"Why, where did you meet Cinders?\" asked Miss Biglow as she put down the\ntray.\n\n\"He came to us the first night we were at Pirate's Haven,\" explained\nRicky. \"I thought he was a ghost or something when he scratched at the\nback door.\"\n\n\"So that's where he was. He used to go over to the Harrisons' for meals\na lot. When I'm working I don't keep very regular hours and he doesn't\nlike to be neglected. Come here, Cinders, and make your manners.\"\n\nReplying to her invitation with an insolent flirt of his tail, Cinders,\nwhom Val continued obstinately to regard as \"Satan,\" disappeared around\nthe corner of the balcony. Charity Biglow looked at them solemnly. \"So\nobedient,\" she observed; \"just like a child.\"\n\n\"Are you an artist, too?\" Ricky asked as she put down her glass.\n\nMiss Biglow's face wrinkled into a grimace. \"My critics say not. I\nmanage to provide daily bread and sometimes a slice of cake by doing\nillustrations for action stories. And then once in a while I labor for\nthe good of my soul and try to produce something my more charitable\nfriends advise me to send to a show.\"\n\n\"May--may we see some of them--the pictures, I mean?\" inquired Ricky\ntimidly.\n\n\"If you can bear it. I use the side balcony for a workshop in this kind\nof weather. I'm working on a picture now, something more ambitious than\nI usually attempt in heat of this sort. But my model didn't show up this\nmorning so I'm at a loose end.\"\n\nShe led them around the corner where Satan had disappeared and pointed\nto a table with a sketching board at one end, several canvases leaning\nface against the house, and an easel covered with a clean strip of\nlinen. \"My workshop. A trifle untidy, but then I am an untidy person.\nI'm expecting an order so I'm just whiling away my time working on an\nidea of my own until it comes.\"\n\nRicky touched the strip of covering across the canvas on the easel. \"May\nI?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes. It might be a help, getting some other person's reaction to the\nthing. I had a clear idea of what I wanted to do when I started but I\ndon't think it's turning out to be what I planned.\"\n\nRicky lifted off the cover. Val stared at the canvas.\n\n[Illustration: _Ricky lifted off the cover. Val stared at the canvas._]\n\n\"But that is he!\" he exclaimed.\n\nCharity Biglow turned to the boy. \"And what do you mean--\"\n\n\"That's the boy I found in the garden, Ricky!\"\n\n\"Is it?\" She stared, fascinated, at the lean brown face, the untidy\nblack hair, the bitter mouth, which their hostess had so skilfully\ncaught in her unfinished drawing.\n\n\"So you've met Jeems.\" Miss Biglow looked at Val thoughtfully. \"And what\ndid you think of him?\"\n\n\"It's rather--what did he think of me. He seemed to hate me. I don't\nknow why. All I ever said to him was 'Hello.'\"\n\n\"Jeems is a queer person--\"\n\n\"Sam says that he is none too honest,\" observed Ricky, her attention\nstill held by the picture.\n\nMiss Biglow shook her head. \"There is a sort of feud between the swamp\npeople and the farmers around here. And neither side is wholly to be\nbelieved in their estimation of the other. Jeems isn't dishonest, and\nneither are a great many of the muskrat hunters. In the early days all\nkinds of outlaws and wanted men fled into the swamps and lived there\nwith the hunters. One or two desperate men gave the whole of the swamp\npeople a bad name and it has stuck. They are a strange folk back there\nin the fur country.\n\n\"Some are Cajuns, descendants of exiles from Evangeline's country; some\nare Creoles who took to that way of life after the Civil War ruined\nthem. There's many a barefooted boy or girl of the swamps who bears a\nname that was once honored at the Court of France or Spain. And there\nare Americans of the old frontier stock who came down river with Andrew\nJackson's army from the wilds of Tennessee and the Indian country. It's\na strange mixture, and once in a while you find a person like Jeems. He\nspeaks the uneducated jargon of his people but he reads and writes\nFrench and English perfectly. He has studied under P\u00e8re Armand until he\nhas a classical education such as was popular for Creole boys of good\nfamily some fifty years ago. P\u00e8re Armand is an old man now, but he is as\ngood an instructor as he is a priest.\n\n\"Jeems wants to make something of himself. He argues logically that the\nswamp has undeveloped resources which might save its inhabitants from\nthe grinding poverty which is slowly destroying them. And it is Jeems'\nhope that he can discover some of the swamp secrets when he is fitted by\ntraining to do so.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\" Val asked. \"Is Jeems his first or last name?\"\n\n\"His last. I have never heard his given name. He is very reticent about\nhis past, though I do know that he is an orphan. But he is of Creole\ndescent and he does have breeding as well as ambition. Unfortunately he\nhad quite an unpleasant experience with a boy who was visiting the\nHarrisons last summer. The visitor accused Jeems of taking a fine rifle\nwhich was later discovered right where the boy had left it in his own\ncanoe. Jeems has a certain pride and he was turned against all the\nplantation people. His attitude is unfortunate because he longs so for a\ndifferent sort of life and yet has no contact with young people except\nthose of the swamp. I think he is beginning to trust me, for he will\ncome in the mornings to pose for my picture of the swamp hunter. Do you\nknow,\" she hesitated, \"I think that you would find a real friend in\nJeems if you could overcome his hatred of plantation people. You would\ngain as much as he from such an association. He can tell you things\nabout the swamp--stories which go back to the old pirate days.\nPerhaps--\"\n\nRicky looked up from the uncompleted picture. \"I think he'd be nice to\nknow. But why does he look so--so sort of starved?\"\n\n\"Probably because the bill of fare in a swamp cabin is not as varied as\nit might be,\" answered Charity Biglow. \"But you can't offer him\nanything, of course. I don't even know where he lives. And now, tell me\nabout yourselves. Are you planning to live here?\"\n\nHer frank interest seemed perfectly natural. One simply couldn't resent\nCharity Biglow.\n\n\"Well,\" Ricky laughed ruefully, \"we can't very well live anywhere else.\nI think Rupert still has ten dollars--\"\n\n\"After his expedition this morning, I would have my doubts of that,\" Val\ncut in. \"You see, Miss Biglow, we are back to the soil now.\"\n\n\"Charity is the name,\" she corrected him. \"So you're down--\"\n\n\"But not out!\" Ricky hastened to assure her. \"But we might be that.\" And\nthen and there she told their tenant of the rival claimant.\n\nCharity listened closely, absent-mindedly sucking the wooden shaft of\none of her brushes. When Ricky had done, she nodded.\n\n\"Nice mess you've dropped into. But I think that your lawyer has the\nright idea. This is a neat piece of blackmail and your claimant will\ndisappear into thin air if you have a few concrete facts to face him\ndown with. Are you sure you've looked through all the family papers? No\nhiding-places or safes--\"\n\n\"One,\" said Ricky calmly, \"but we don't know where that is. In the Civil\nWar days, after General Butler took over New Orleans, some family\npossessions were hidden somewhere in the Long Hall, but we don't know\nwhere. The secret was lost when Richard Ralestone was shot by Yankee\nraiders.\"\n\n\"Is he the ghost?\" asked Charity.\n\n\"No. You ask that as if you know something,\" Val observed.\n\n\"Nothing but talk. There have been lights seen, white ones. And a while\nback my maid Rose left because she saw something in the garden one\nnight.\"\n\n\"Jeems, probably,\" the boy commented. \"He seems to like the place.\"\n\n\"No, not Jeems. He was sitting right on that railing when we both heard\nRose scream.\"\n\n\"Val, the handkerchief!\" Ricky's hand arose to her buttoned pocket.\n\"Then there _was_ someone inside the house that night. But why--unless\nthey were after the treasure!\"\n\n\"The quickest way to find out,\" her brother got up from the edge of the\ntable where he had perched, \"is to go and do a little probing of our\nown. We have a good two hours until lunch. Will you join us?\" he asked\nCharity.\n\n\"You tempt me, but I've got to get in as much work on this as I can,\"\nshe indicated her canvas. \"And Jeems may show up even if it is late. So\nmy conscience says 'No.' Unfortunately I do possess a regular\nrock-ribbed New England conscience.\"\n\n\"Rupert will be back by four,\" said Ricky. \"Will your conscience let you\ncome over for coffee with us then? You see how quickly we have adopted\nthe native customs--coffee at four.\"\n\n\"Ricky,\" her brother explained, \"desires to become that figure of\nRomance--the southern belle.\"\n\n\"Then we must do what we can to help her create the proper atmosphere,\"\nurged Charity solemnly.\n\n\"Even to the victoria and the coach-hound?\" Val demanded in dismay.\n\n\"Well, perhaps not that far,\" she laughed. \"Anyway, I accept your kind\ninvitation with pleasure. I shall be there at four--if I can find a\npresentable dress. Now clear out, you two, and see what secrets of the\npast you can uncover before lunch time.\"\n\nBut their explorations resulted in nothing except slightly frayed\ntempers. Val had sounded what paneling there was, but as he had no idea\nwhat a hollow panel should sound like if rapped, he inwardly decided\nthat he was not exactly fitted for such investigations.\n\nRicky broke two fingernails pressing the carving about the fireplace and\nsat down on the couch to state in no uncertain terms what she thought of\nthe house, and of their ancestor who had been so misguided as to get\nhimself shot after hiding the stuff. She ended with a brilliant but\nshort description of Val's present habits and vices--which she added\nbecause he happened to have said meekly enough that if she would only\ntrim her nails to a reasonable length, such accidents could be avoided.\n\nWhen she had done, her brother sat back on the lowest step of the stairs\nand wiped his hands on his handkerchief.\n\n\"Seeing that I have been crawling about on my hands and knees inspecting\ncracks in the floor, I think I have as much right to lose my temper as\nyou have. Short of tearing the house down, I don't see how we are going\nto find anything without directions. And I am _not_ in favor of taking\nsuch a drastic step as yet.\"\n\n\"It's around here somewhere, I know it!\" She kicked petulantly at the\nhearth-stone.\n\n\"That statement is certainly a big help,\" Val commented. \"Several yards\nacross and I don't know how many up and down--and you just know it's\nthere somewhere. Well, you can keep on pressing until you wear your\nfingers out, but I'm calling it a day right now.\"\n\nShe did not answer, and he got stiffly to his feet. He was hot and more\ntired than he had been since he had left the hospital. Because he was\njust as sure as Ricky that the key to their riddle must be directly\nbefore them at that moment, he was thoroughly disgusted.\n\nA strange sound from his sister brought him around. Ricky was not pretty\nwhen she cried. No pearly drops slipped down white cheeks. Her nose\nshone red and she sniffed. But Ricky did not cry often. Only when she\nwas discouraged, or when she was really hurt.\n\n\"Why, Ricky--\" Val began uncertainly.\n\n\"Go 'way,\" she hiccupped. \"You don't care--you don't care 'bout\nanything. If we have to lose this--\"\n\n\"We won't! We'll find a way!\" he assured her hurriedly. \"I'm sorry I\nsnapped at you. I'm just tired and hot, and so are you. Let's go\nupstairs and freshen up. Lunch will be ready--\"\n\n\"I kno-o-ow--\" her sob deepened into a wail. \"Then Rupert will laugh at\nus and--\"\n\n\"Ricky! For goodness sake, pull yourself together!\"\n\nShe looked up at him, round-mouthed in surprise at his sharpness. And\nthen to his amazement she began to giggle, her giggles mixed with her\nsobs. \"You do look so funny,\" she gasped, \"like the stern father of a\nfamily. Why don't you fight back always when I get mean, Val?\"\n\nHe grinned back at her. \"I don't know. Shall I, next time?\"\n\nShe rubbed her face with a businesslike air and tucked her handkerchief\naway. \"There isn't going to be any next time,\" she announced briskly.\n\"If there is--well--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Val prompted.\n\n\"Then you can just spank me or something drastic. Come on, I must look a\nsight. And goodness knows, you're no beauty with that black mark across\nyour chin and your slacks all grimy at the knees. We've got to clean up\nbefore lunch or Letty-Lou will think we're some sort of heathen.\"\n\nWith that she turned and led the way upstairs, totally recovered and\nherself again in spite of a red nose and suspiciously moist eyelashes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nSATAN GOES A-HUNTING AND FINDS WORK FOR IDLE HANDS\n\n\n\"Val, did that cat go upstairs?\" Ricky stood at the foot of the hall\nstaircase frowning crossly. \"If he did, you'll just have to go up and\nget him. I will not have him walking on the beds with muddy feet.\nThere's enough to do here without cleaning up after a lazy cat. Where's\nRupert?\"\n\nHer brother put aside his note-book and got up from the couch with a\nlazy stretch. Ricky's early-morning energy was apt to be a little\nirksome and Val had not had a good night. When one lies and stares up at\na ceiling, one sometimes hears strange noises which cannot be accounted\nfor by wind or creaking boards.\n\n\"He retired into Bluebeard's den right after breakfast and he hasn't\nappeared since.\"\n\n\"I should think that after what he heard yesterday he'd be doing\nsomething,\" she protested.\n\n\"And what is there for him to do? You know just how far we got with our\ninvestigations yesterday. Go rap on his door if you like and stir him\nup. But I don't think his welcome will be a cordial one.\"\n\nRicky sat down on the bottom step and pushed the hair back from her\nforehead. Suddenly she looked very small and faintly forlorn with all\nthat expanse of age-blackened wood behind her.\n\n\"I can't understand you two at all. One would think you would be just as\nwell pleased if that Beezel the rival walked off with this place. You\naren't even trying to fight!\"\n\n\"Listen, Ricky, how can we fight when we have nothing solid to fight\nwith? LeFleur is doing all he can, we have explored every possibility\nhere--\"\n\n\"Val, don't you _want_ to stay here?\" she interrupted him.\n\nHe looked around at stone and wood. Did he really want to? His instant\nhot anger at the thought of another owner there was his answer. Why,\nthis house was a part of them, as much as if they had laid its\nfoundation stones with their own hands. They had been brought up on its\nblood-stained legends, and on the one or two happier tales which had\nbeen lived within its walls. If they had to leave, they would regret it\nall their lives. And yet--Rupert seemed to take no interest in the\nclaims of the rival, and only Ricky wanted to fight.\n\nRicky got up from the stairs.\n\n\"We might as well go up and catch that cat,\" she said.\n\nAt the top of the stairs Satan sat, his eyes upon the landing windows.\nVal reached out his hands for him, but in that single instant Satan was\ngone. A black tail disappeared around the door of the Jackson room.\n\n\"Oh, dear, I hope he isn't going to get on that bed.\" Ricky opened the\ndoor wider. \"No, there he goes under instead of on it. Can you see him,\nVal?\"\n\nHer brother crouched and lifted the edge of the brocaded cover which\nswept to the floor. To Val's surprise a thin line of light showed along\nthe wall at the head of the bed.\n\n\"Ricky, look behind the head of the bed! Is it fast against the wall?\"\n\nShe started to the tall canopied head and pulled the faded fabrics away\nfrom the paneling. \"No, there's about two feet here at the bottom. It\ndoesn't show because the canopy covers it. And, Val, there's an opening\nhere! Satan's trying to get through!\"\n\n\"We need a flashlight.\"\n\n\"I'll get Rupert's. Val, promise not to go in--if it _is_ a door--until\nI come back!\"\n\n\"Of course; but hurry.\"\n\nThe flashlight revealed a wide panel which slid upward. Time and damp\nhad warped the wood so that it no longer fitted snugly to the floor as\nthe builder had intended. But the same warping made the door defy their\nefforts to raise it any higher. At last, by prying and pounding, they\ngot it up perhaps a yard from the floor. Satan slipped through and they\nfollowed on hands and knees.\n\nThey crawled into a small room lighted by two round windows set like\neyes in the side wall. More than three-quarters of the space was filled\nwith furniture and boxes wrapped in tarred canvas. The choking dust and\ngeneral mustiness of the long-closed apartment drove Val to investigate\nthe window fastenings and throw them open to the morning air.\n\n\"There must be another door somewhere,\" he said, calling Ricky away from\na box where she was picking at the knotted rope which bound it. \"All\nthese things couldn't have been brought through that hole behind the\nbed.\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" she said a moment later, pointing to an oblong set flush\nwith the wall. \"It's bolted on this side.\"\n\n\"Let me open it and see where we are.\" Val fumbled at the rusty latch,\nbut he had to use an iron poker from a discarded fire stand in the\ncorner before he could hammer it back. Again the door resisted their\nefforts to push it open until Val flung his full weight against it. With\na snapping report it swung open and he sprawled forward into the short\nhall which had once led into the garden wing, an ell of the house\ndestroyed by roving British raiders during the days of 1815. The only\nwholly wooden portion of the house, it had been burnt and never rebuilt.\n\n\"Come on,\" Ricky pulled at Val's sleeve, \"let's explore.\"\n\nHe looked at his black hands. \"I would suggest some soap and water,\nseveral brooms, and some dusting cloths if we're going to do it right.\nBetter make a regular house-cleaning party of it.\"\n\n\"Goodness, what have I strayed into?\" Charity Biglow stood in the lower\nhall staring at the younger Ralestones as they came through from the\nkitchen. They had both changed into their oldest and least respectable\nclothes. Ricky, in fact, was wearing a pair of Val's slacks and one of\nRupert's shirts, and they were burdened with a broom which was long past\nits youth, several smaller brushes, and a great bundle of floor-cloths.\n\n\"We've found a secret room--\" began Ricky.\n\n\"As one door has been in plain sight since the building of this house,\nit could hardly be called a secret room,\" Val objected.\n\n\"Well, we didn't know it was there until Satan found the back entrance\nfor us. And now we're going to clean it out. It's full of furniture and\nboxes and things.\"\n\n\"Don't!\" Charity held up a paint-streaked hand. \"You will have me\ndrooling in a moment. I don't suppose you could use another assistant?\nAfter all, it was my cat who found it for you. If you can provide me\nwith a set of those weird coverings which seem to be your house-cleaning\nuniforms, I would just love to wield a broom in your company.\"\n\n\"The more the merrier,\" laughed Ricky. \"I think Val has another pair of\nslacks--\"\n\n\"That's right, dispose of my wardrobe before my face,\" he commented,\nbalancing his load more carefully in preparation for climbing the\nstairs. \"Only spare my white flannels, please. I'm saving those for the\noccasion when I can play the country gentleman in style.\"\n\nUpstairs he braced open the hall door of the storage-room. The open\nwindows had cleared the air within but they were too high and too small\nto admit enough light to reach the far corners. It would be best, they\ndecided, to carry each box and piece of furniture to the hall for\nexamination. With the zeal of treasure hunters they set to work.\n\nSome time later, when Val was coaxing the second box through the door,\nthey were interrupted.\n\n\"And just what is going on here?\" Rupert stood at the end of the hall.\n\n\"Oh,\" Ricky smiled sweetly, \"did we really disturb you?\"\n\n\"Well, I did think that there was a troop of elephants doing tap dancing\nup here. But that isn't the point--just _what_ are you doing?\"\n\n\"Cleaning house.\" Ricky flicked a gray rag in his direction freeing a\ncloud of dust. \"Don't you think it needs it?\"\n\nRupert sneezed. \"It seems so. But why--? Miss Biglow!\"\n\nCharity, extremely dirty--she had apparently run dusty hands across her\nforehead several times--had come to the door of the storage-room. At the\nsight of Rupert she flushed and made a hurried attempt at smoothing her\nhair.\n\n\"I--\" she began, when Ricky interrupted her.\n\n\"Charity is helping us, which is more than we can say of you. Go back to\nyour old den and hibernate. And then you can't look down that long nose\nof yours when we turn up the papers that'll save us from the poorhouse.\"\n\n\"That's telling him,\" Val murmured approvingly as he fanned himself with\none of the cleaner cloths. \"But perhaps we had better explain. You see,\nSatan went hunting and found work for idle hands,\" and he told the tale\nof the sliding panel behind the bed.\n\nWhen he had finished, Rupert laughed. \"So you are still determined on\ntreasure hunting, are you? Well, if it will keep you out of mischief, go\nto it.\"\n\n\"Rupert,\" Ricky faced him squarely, \"don't be utterly insufferable.\nIf you had one drop of hot blood in you, you'd be just as thrilled\nas we are. Just because you've been around and around the world until\nyou got dizzy or something, you needn't stand there with that\n'See-the-little-children-play' smirk on your face. You don't really care\nwhether we lose Pirate's Haven or not, do you?\"\n\nRupert straightened and the color crept up across his high cheek-bones.\nHis mouth opened and then he closed it again without speaking the words\nhe had intended, closed with a firmness which tightened his lips into a\nstraight line.\n\n\"Don't stand there and glower at me,\" Ricky went on. \"Why don't you say\nwhat you were going to? I'm just about tired of this world-weary\nattitude--\"\n\n\"Ricky!\" Val clapped his black hand over her mouth and turned to\nCharity. \"Please excuse the fireworks. They are not usual, I assure\nyou.\"\n\n\"Let me go!\" Ricky twisted out of his grip. \"I don't care if Charity\ndoes hear. She ought to know what we're really like!\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself, my pet.\" The red had faded from Rupert's face. \"You\ndo have a nice little habit of speaking your mind, don't you? But on\nthis occasion I believe you're at least eight-tenths right. I have been\nneglecting my opportunities. Suppose you let me get at that box, Val.\nAnd look here, if you are going to unpack these, why not move them down\nto the end of the hall and turn them out on a sheet?\"\n\nCharity and Ricky suddenly disappeared back into the room and were very\nbusy whenever Rupert crossed their line of vision, but Val was heartily\nglad of his brother's help in lifting and pulling.\n\n\"Better not try to take this bedstead and stuff out,\" Rupert advised\nwhen they had the three boxes out in the hall. \"We have no need for it\nnow, anyway.\"\n\n\"I believe--yes, it is! A real Sergnoret piece!\" Charity was\nindustriously rubbing away at the head of the bed. Rupert knelt down\nbeside her.\n\n\"And just what is a Sergnoret piece?\"\n\n\"A collector's item nowadays. Fran\u00e7ois Sergnoret was one of the greatest\ncabinet-makers of New Orleans. See that 'S'--that's the way he always\nsigned his work.\"\n\n\"Treasure trove!\" cried Ricky. \"I wonder how much it's worth?\"\n\n\"Exactly nothing to us.\" Rupert was running his hands across the\nmahogany. \"We couldn't sell anything from this house until the title is\ncleared.\"\n\nAs Val moved around to the opposite side to see better, his foot struck\nagainst something on the floor. He stooped and picked up a box with a\nslanting cover, the whole black and smooth with age and the rubbing of\ncountless hands.\n\n\"What's this?\" He had crossed to the door and was examining his find in\nthe light.\n\nRupert's hand fell upon his shoulder. \"Val, be careful of that. Charity,\nhe's got something here!\" He pulled her up beside him, not noting in his\nexcitement that he had broken out of the formal shell which seemed to\nwall him in whenever she was around.\n\n\"A Bible box! And an authentic one, too!\" She drew her fingers down the\nslope of the lid.\n\n\"And just what is it?\" Val asked for the second time.\n\n\"These boxes were used in the seventeenth century for writing-desks and\nlater to keep the large family Bibles in. But this is the first one I've\never seen outside of a museum. What's this on the lid?\" She traced a\nworn outline. Val studied the design.\n\n\"Why, it's Joe! You know, that grinning skull we have stuck up all over\nthe place to bolster up our superiority complex. That proves that this\nis ours, all right.\"\n\n\"Perhaps--\" Ricky's eyes were round with excitement, \"perhaps it\nbelonged to Pirate Dick himself!\"\n\n\"Perhaps it did,\" her younger brother agreed.\n\n\"Lift the lid.\" She was almost hopping on one foot in her impatience.\n\"Let's see what's inside.\"\n\n\"No gold or jewels, I'll wager. How do you get the thing undone?\"\n\n\"Here, let me try.\" Rupert took it from Val's hands and put it down on\none of the chests, squatting on the floor before it. With the smallest\nblade of his penknife he delicately probed the fastening sunken in the\nwood.\n\n\"I could do a faster job,\" he remarked, \"if you didn't all breathe down\nthe back of my neck.\" They retreated two inches or so and waited\nimpatiently. With a satisfied grunt he dropped his knife and pulled the\nlid up.\n\n\"Why, there's nothing in it!\" Ricky's cry of disappointment was almost a\nwail.\n\n\"Nothing but that old torn lining.\" Val was as disgusted as she.\n\nRupert closed it again. \"I'll rub this up some and put in another\nlining. This is too good a piece to hide away up here,\" and he put it\ncarefully aside at the end of the hall.\n\nTheir investigations yielded nothing more except great quantities of\ndust, a mummified rat which even Satan refused to sniff at, and a large\ncollection of spider webs. Having swept out the room, they went to wash\ntheir hands before unpacking the well-wrapped boxes.\n\nWhen their swathing canvas and sacking was thrown aside, the boxes stood\nrevealed as stout chests banded with iron. Charity paused before one.\n\"This is a marriage chest, late seventeenth century, I would judge. Look\nthere, under that carved leaf--isn't that a date?\"\n\n\"Sixteen hundred ninety-three,\" Rupert deciphered. \"That crest above it\nlooks familiar. I know, it belonged to that French lady who married our\npirate ancestor.\"\n\n\"The first Lady Richanda!\" Ricky touched the chest lovingly. \"Then this\nis mine, Rupert. Can't it be mine?\" she coaxed.\n\n\"Of course. But it's locked, and as we don't have any keys which would\nfit the lock, you'll have to wait until we can get a locksmith out to\nwork on it before you will know what's inside.\"\n\n\"I don't care. No,\" she corrected herself, \"that's wrong; I do care. But\nanyway its mine!\" She caressed the stiff carving with her fingers.\n\n\"What's this one?\" Val turned to the second box. It, too, was fashioned\nof wood, but it was plain where the other was carved, and the iron bands\nacross it were pitted with rust.\n\n\"A sea chest, I would say.\" Rupert touched the top gingerly. \"By the\nfeel, it's locked too. And I don't care to play around with it. The men\nwho made things like these were too fond of having little poisoned fangs\nrun into your hand when you tried to force the chest without knowing the\ntrick. We'll have to leave this for an expert, too.\"\n\n\"What about the third?\"\n\nCharity laughed. \"After your two treasures I'm afraid that this will be\na disappointment.\" She indicated a small humpbacked trunk covered with\nmoth-eaten horsehair. \"No romance here. But the key is tied to the clasp\nbeside the lock.\"\n\n\"Then open it before I expire of pure unsatisfied curiosity,\" Ricky\nbegged. \"Go on, Rupert. Hurry.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said a moment later, \"it's full of nothing but a lot of\nbooks.\"\n\n\"What did you expect,\" Val asked her, \"a skeleton? Do you know, I think\nthat Rick's ghost, or whatever influence presides over this house, has a\nsense of humor. You find a room, or a trunk, or something which makes\nyou feel that you are on the verge of getting what you want, and then it\nall fades into just nothing again. Now, by rights, that writing-desk\nshould have contained the secret message which would have told us where\nto find a hidden passage or something. But what is in it? A couple of\npieces of lining almost completely torn from the bottom. I'll wager that\nwhen you open those chests you'll find nothing but a brick or 'April\nFool' scrawled across the inside. This isn't true to any fiction I ever\nread,\" he ended plaintively.\n\n\"Good Heavens!\" Charity was staring down at what lay within a portfolio\nshe had opened.\n\n\"Don't tell me you have really found something!\" Val exclaimed.\n\n\"It can't be true!\" She still stared at what she held.\n\nRicky looked over her shoulder. \"Why, it's nothing but a picture of a\nbird,\" she observed.\n\n\"It's a genuine Audubon,\" Charity corrected her.\n\n[Illustration: _\"It's a genuine Audubon,\" Charity said._]\n\n\"What!\" With little regard for manners, Rupert snatched the portfolio\nfrom her hands. \"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Yes. But you must take it in to the museum and get an expert opinion.\nIt's wonderful!\"\n\n\"Here's another.\" Reverently Rupert raised the first sketch and then the\nsecond. \"Three, four, five, six,\" he counted.\n\n\"Was Audubon ever here?\" Charity looked about the hall, a sort of awe\ncoloring her voice.\n\n\"He might easily have been when he lived in New Orleans. Though we have\nno record of it,\" answered Rupert. \"But these,\" he closed the portfolio\ncarefully and knotted its strings, \"speak for themselves. I'll take them\nto LeFleur tomorrow. We can't allow them to lie about here.\"\n\n\"I should hope not!\" Charity eyed the portfolio wistfully. \"Imagine\nactually owning six of those--\"\n\n\"They won't pay our bills,\" said Ricky, practical for once in her life.\nTreasure to Ricky was not half a dozen sketches on yellowed paper but\ngood old-fashioned gold with a few jewels thrown in for her own private\nsatisfaction. The portfolio and its contents left her unmoved. Val\nadmitted to himself that he, too, was disappointed. After all--well,\ntreasure should be treasure.\n\nRupert carried the portfolio into his bedroom and locked it in one of\nhis mysterious brief-cases which had somehow found its way upstairs.\n\nThe two chests they moved out farther into the hall and the trunk was\nplaced back against the wall, ready for further investigation.\n\n\"Mistuh Ralestone, suh,\" Letty-Lou, standing half-way up the back\nstairs, addressed Rupert, \"lunch am on de table. Effen yo'all doan come\nnow, de eatments will be spiled.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he answered.\n\n\"Letty-Lou,\" called Ricky, \"put on another plate. Miss Charity is\nstaying to lunch.\"\n\n\"Dat's all ri', Miss 'Chanda. I'se done done dat. Yo'all comin' now?\"\n\n\"You see how we are bullied,\" Ricky appealed to Charity. \"Of course\nyou're going to stay,\" she swept aside the other's protests. \"What's\nfood for, if not to feed your friends? Val, go wash up; your hands are\nfrightful. I don't care if you did wash once; go and--\"\n\n\"This is her little-mother-of-the-family mood,\" her younger brother\nexplained to Charity. \"It wears off after a while if you just don't\nnotice it. But I will wash though,\" he looked at his hands, \"I seem to\nneed it.\"\n\n\"And don't use the guest towels,\" Ricky called after him. \"You know that\nthey're only to look at.\"\n\nWhen Val emerged from the bathroom he found the hall deserted. Sounds\nfrom below suggested that his family had basely left him for food. He\nstarted along the passage. Not far from the stairs was the writing-desk\nwhere Rupert had left it. Val picked it up, thinking that he might as\nwell take it along down with him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nBY OUR LUCK!\n\n\nDepositing the desk on the seat of one of the hall chairs, Val started\ntoward the dining-room, a grim hole which Lucy had calmly forced the\nfamily to use but which they all cordially disliked. Its paneled walls,\ncrystal-hung chandelier, marble-fronted fireplace, and inlaid floor gave\nit the appearance of one of the less cozy rooms in a small palace. There\nwere also two tasteful portraits of dead ducks which had been added as a\nfinishing touch by some tenant during the eighties and which still\nremained upon the walls to Ricky's unholy joy.\n\nBut the long table, the high-backed chairs, the side serving-table, and\nthe two tall cabinets of china were fine enough pieces if one cared for\nthe massive. Ricky's table-cloth of violent-hued peasant linen was not\nin keeping with the china and glassware Letty-Lou had set out upon it.\nCharity was commenting upon this ensemble as Val entered.\n\n\"Doesn't this red and green plaid seem a bit--well, bright?\" The corners\nof her mouth twitched betrayingly.\n\n\"No,\" Ricky returned firmly. \"This cloth matches the ducks.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, the ducks,\" Charity eyed them. \"So you consider that the ducks\nare the note you wish to emphasize?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\" Ricky surveyed the picture hanging opposite her. \"I\nconsider them unique. Not everyone can have ducks in the dining-room\nnowadays.\"\n\n\"For which they should be eternally thankful,\" observed Rupert. \"They\nare rather gaudy, aren't they?\"\n\n\"Oh, but I like the expression in this one's glassy eye,\" Ricky pointed\nout. \"You might call this study 'Gone But Not Forgotten.'\"\n\n\"Corn-bread, please,\" Val asked, thus attempting to put an end to the\nart-appreciation class.\n\n\"I think,\" continued Ricky, undisturbed as she passed him the plate\nheaped with golden squares, \"that they are slightly surrealist. They\ndistinctly resemble the sort of things one is often pursued by in one's\nbrighter nightmares.\"\n\n\"Do you have any really good pictures?\" asked Charity, resolutely\naverting her gaze from the ducks.\n\n\"Three, but they've been loaned to the museum,\" answered Rupert. \"Not by\nwell-known painters, but they're historically interesting. There's one\nof the first Lady Richanda, and one of the missing Rick. That's the best\nof the lot, according to LeFleur. I saw a photograph of it once. Come to\nthink about it, Val looks a lot like the boy in the picture. He might\nhave sat for it.\"\n\nThey all turned to eye Val. He arose and bowed. \"I find these\ncompliments too overwhelming,\" he murmured.\n\nRupert grinned. \"And how do you know that that remark was intended as a\ncompliment?\"\n\n\"Naturally I assumed so,\" his brother retorted with a dignity which\ndisappeared as the piece of corn-bread in his hand broke in two, the\nlarger and more liberally buttered portion falling butter side down on\nthe table. Ricky smiled in a pained sort of way as she attempted to\njudge from her side of the table just how much damage Val's awkwardness\nhad done.\n\n\"If you were the graceful hostess,\" he informed her severely, \"you would\nnow throw your piece in the middle to show that anyone could suffer a\nlike mishap.\"\n\nRicky changed the subject hurriedly by passing beans to Charity.\n\n\"So Val looks like the ghost,\" Charity said a moment later. \"Now I will\nhave to go to town and see that portrait. Just where is it?\"\n\nRupert shook his head. \"I don't know. But it's listed in the catalogue\nas 'Portrait of Roderick Ralestone, Aged Eighteen.'\"\n\n\"Just Val's age, then.\" Ricky spooned some watermelon pickles onto her\nplate. \"But he was older than that when he left here.\"\n\n\"Let's see. He was born in February, 1788, which would make him fourteen\nwhen his parents died in 1802. Then he disappeared in 1814, twelve years\nlater. Just twenty-six when he went,\" computed Rupert.\n\n\"A year younger than you are now,\" observed Ricky.\n\n\"And nine years older than yourself at this present date,\" Val added\npleasantly. \"Why this sudden interest in mathematics?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. Only somehow I always thought Rick was younger when\nhe went away. I've always felt sorry for him. Wonder what happened to\nhim afterwards?\"\n\n\"According to our rival,\" Rupert pulled his coffee-cup before him as\nLetty-Lou took away their plates, \"he just went quietly away, married,\nlived soberly, and brought up a son, who in turn fathered a son, and so\non to the present day. A tame enough ending for our wild privateersman.\"\n\n\"I'll bet it isn't true. Rick wouldn't end like that. He probably went\noff down south and got mixed up in some of the revolutions they were\nhaving at the time,\" suggested Ricky. \"He couldn't just settle down and\ndie in bed. I could imagine him scuttling a ship but not being a quiet\nbusiness man.\"\n\n\"He was one of Lafitte's men, wasn't he?\" asked Charity. At their\nanswering nods, she went on: \"Lafitte was a business man, you know. Oh,\nI don't mean that forge he ran in town, but his establishment at Grande\nTerre. He was more smuggler than pirate, that's why he lasted so long.\nEven the most respected tradesmen had dealings with him. Why, he used to\npost notices right in town when he held auctions at Barataria, listing\nwhat he had to sell, mostly smuggled Negroes and a few cargoes of\nluxuries from Europe. He was a privateer under the rules of war, but he\nwas never a real pirate. At least, that's the belief held nowadays.\"\n\n\"We can't turn up our noses at pirates,\" laughed Ricky. \"This house was\nbuilt by pirate gold. We only wish--\"\n\nFrom the hall came a dull thump. Ricky's napkin dropped from her hand\ninto her coffee-cup. Rupert laid down his spoon deliberately enough, but\nthere was a certain tension in his movements. Val felt a sudden chill.\nFor Letty-Lou was in the kitchen, the family were in the dining-room.\nThere should be no one in the hall.\n\nRupert pushed back his chair. But Val was already half-way to the door\nwhen his brother joined him. And Ricky, suddenly sober, was at their\nheels.\n\n_Zzzzzrupp!_ The slitting sound was clear as they burst into the hall.\nOn the fur rug by the couch lay the writing-desk. Its lid was thrown\nback and by it crouched Satan industriously ripping the remnants of\nlining from its interior. As Rupert came up, the cat drew back, his ears\nflattened and his lips a-snarl.\n\n[Illustration: Zzzzzrupp! _Satan was industriously ripping the remnants\nof lining from its interior._]\n\n\"Cinders! What has he done?\" demanded Charity, swooping down upon her\npet. At her coming, he fled under the couch out of reach.\n\nRupert picked up the desk. \"Nothing much,\" he laughed. \"Just torn all\nthat lining loose, as I had planned to do.\"\n\n\"What is this?\" Ricky disentangled a small slip of white from the torn\nand musty velvet. \"Why, it's a piece of paper,\" she answered her own\nquestion. \"It must have been under the lining and Satan pulled it out\nwith the cloth.\"\n\n\"Here,\" Rupert took it from her, \"let me see it.\"\n\nHe scanned the faded lines of writing. \"Val! Ricky!\" He looked up, his\nface flushed with excitement. \"Listen!\"\n\n     \"Gatty has returned from the city. The raiders calling themselves\n     the 'Buck Boys' are headed this way. Gatty tells me that Alexander\n     is with them, having deserted the plantation a week ago. Since his\n     malice towards us is well known, it is easy to believe that he\n     means us open harm. I am making my preparations accordingly. The\n     valuables now under this roof, together with the proceeds from the\n     last voyage of the blockade runner, _Red Bird_, I am putting in\n     that safe place discovered by me in childhood, of which I have\n     sometimes spoken. Remember the hint I once gave you--By Our Luck.\n     Having written this in haste, I shall intrust it to Gatty--\"\n\n\"That's the end; the rest is gone.\" Rupert stared down at the scrap of\npaper in his hand as if he simply could not believe in its reality.\n\n\"Richard wrote that.\" Ricky touched the note in awe. \"But why didn't\nGatty give it to Miles when he came?\"\n\n\"Gatty was probably a slave who ran when the raiders appeared,\"\nsuggested Rupert. \"He or she must have hidden this in here before\nleaving. We'll never know.\"\n\n\"But we've got our clue!\" cried Ricky. \"We knew that the hiding-place\nwas in this hall, and now we have the clue.\"\n\n\"'By our Luck.'\" Rupert looked about him thoughtfully. \"That's not the\nmost helpful--\"\n\n\"Rupert!\" Ricky seized him by the arm. \"There's only one thing in this\nroom that will answer that. Can't you see? The niche of the Luck!\"\n\nTheir gaze followed her pointing finger to the mantel above their heads.\n\n\"I believe she's right! Wait until I get the step-ladder from the\nkitchen.\" Rupert was gone almost before he had finished speaking.\n\n\"Oh, if it's only true!\" Ricky stared up like one hypnotized. \"Then\nwe'll be rich and--\"\n\n\"Don't count your chickens before they're hatched,\" Val reminded her,\nbut he didn't think that she heard him.\n\nThen Rupert was back with the ladder. He climbed up, leaving the three\nof them clustered about its foot.\n\n\"Nothing here but two stone studs to hold the Luck in place,\" he said a\nmoment later.\n\n\"Why not try pressing those?\" suggested Charity.\n\n\"All right, here goes.\" He placed his thumbs in the corners of the niche\nand threw his weight upon them.\n\n\"Nothing happened.\" Ricky's voice was deep with disappointment.\n\n\"Look!\" Val pointed over her shoulder.\n\nTo the left of the fireplace were five panels of oak, to balance those\non the other side about the door of the unused drawing-room. The center\none of these now gaped open, showing a dark cavity.\n\n\"It worked!\" Ricky was already heading for the opening.\n\nThere behind the paneling was a shallow closet which ran the full length\nof the five panels. It was filled with a collection of bags and small\nchests, a collection which appeared much larger when it lay in the gloom\nwithin than when they dragged it out. Then, when they had time to\nexamine it carefully, they discovered that their booty consisted of two\nsmall wooden boxes or chests, one fancifully carved and evidently\nintended for jewels, the other plain but locked; a felt bag and another\nof canvas, and a package hurriedly done up in cloth. Rupert spread it\nall out on the floor.\n\n\"Well,\" he hesitated, \"where shall we begin?\"\n\n\"Charity thought about how to open it, and it was her cat that found us\nthe clue--let her choose,\" Val suggested.\n\n\"Good,\" agreed Rupert. \"And what's your choice, m'lady?\"\n\n\"What woman could resist this?\" She laid her hand upon the jewel box.\n\n\"Then that it is.\" He reached for it.\n\nIt opened readily enough to show a shallow tray divided into\ncompartments, all of them empty.\n\n\"Sold again,\" Val commented dryly.\n\nCarefully Rupert lifted out the top tray to disclose another on which\nrested three small leather bags. He loosened the draw-string of the\nnearest and shook out into his palm a pair of earrings of a quaint\npattern in twisted gold set with dull red stones. Charity pronounced\nthem garnets. Though they were not of great value, they were precious in\nRicky's eyes, and even Charity exclaimed over them.\n\nThe second bag yielded a carnelian seal on a wide chain of gold mesh,\nthe sort of ornament a dandy wore dangling from his watch pocket in the\ndays of the Regency. And the third bag contained a cross of silver,\nblackened by time, set with amethysts. This was accompanied by a chain\nof the same dull metal.\n\nPutting these into the girls' hands, Rupert lifted the second tray to\nlay bare the bottom of the chest. Here again were several small bags.\nThere was another cross, this time of jet inlaid with gold and attached\nto a short necklace of jet beads; a wide bracelet of coral and turquoise\nwhich was crudely made and might have been native work of some sort.\nThen there was a tiny jewel-set bottle, about which, Ricky declared,\nthere still lingered some faint trace of the fragrance it had once held.\nAnd most interesting to Charity was a fan, the sticks carved of ivory so\nintricately that they resembled lacework stiffened into slender ribs.\nThe covering between them was fashioned of layers of silk painted with a\nscene of the bayou country, with the moss-grown oaks and encroaching\nswamp all carefully depicted.\n\nCharity declared that she had never seen its equal and that some great\nartist must have decorated the dainty trifle. She closed it carefully\nand slipped it back into its covering, and Rupert took out the last of\nthe bags. From its depths rolled a ring.\n\nIt was plain enough, a simple band of gold so deep in shade as to be\nalmost red. Nearly an inch in width, there was no ornamentation of any\nsort on its broad, smooth surface.\n\n\"Do you know what this is?\" Rupert turned the circlet around in his\nfingers.\n\n\"No.\" Ricky was still dangling the earrings before her eyes.\n\n\"It is the wedding-ring of the Bride of the Luck.\"\n\n\"What!\" Val leaned forward to look down at the plain circle of gold.\n\nEven Ricky gave her brother her full attention now. Rupert turned to\nCharity.\n\n\"You probably know the story of our Luck?\" he asked.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"When the Luck was brought from Palestine, it was decided that it must\nbe given into the hands of a guardian who would be responsible for it\nwith his or her life. Because the men of the house were always at war\nduring those troublesome times, the guardianship went to the eldest\ndaughter if she were a maiden. By high and solemn ceremony she was\nmarried to the Luck in the chapel of Lorne. And she was the Bride of the\nLuck until death or a unanimous consent from the family released her.\nNor could she marry a mortal husband during the time she wore this.\" He\ntouched the ring he held.\n\n\"This must be very old. It's the red gold which came into Ireland and\nEngland before the Romans conquered the land. Perhaps this was found in\nsome old barrow on Lorne lands. But it no longer means anything without\nthe Luck.\"\n\nHe held it out to Ricky. \"By tradition this is yours.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I don't think I want that, Rupert. It's too\nold--too strange. Now these,\" she held up the earrings, \"you can\nunderstand. The girls who wore them were like me, and they wore them\nbecause they were pretty. But that--\" she looked at the Bride's ring\nwith distaste--\"that must have been a burden to its wearer. Didn't you\ntell us once of the Lady Iseult, who killed herself when they would not\nrelease her from her vows to the Luck? I don't want to wear that, ever.\"\n\n\"Very well.\" He dropped it back into its bag. \"We'll send it to LeFleur\nfor safe-keeping. Any scruples about the rest of this stuff?\"\n\n\"Of course not! And none of it is worth much. May I keep it?\"\n\n\"If you wish. Now let's see what is in here.\" He drew the second box\ntoward him and forced it open.\n\n\"Money!\" Charity was staring at it with wide eyes.\n\nWithin, in neat bundles, lay packages of paper notes. Even Rupert was\nshaken from his calm as he reached for one. Outside of a bank none of\nthem had ever seen such a display of wealth. But after he studied the\ntop note, the master of Pirate's Haven laughed thinly.\n\n\"This may be worth ten cents to some collector if we're lucky--\"\n\n\"Rupert! That's real money,\" began Ricky.\n\nBut Val, too, had seen the print. \"Confederate money, child. As useless\nnow as our pretty oil stock. I told you that things always turn out\nwrong in this house. If we do find treasure, it's worthless. How much is\nthere, anyway?\"\n\nRupert picked up a slip of paper tucked under the tape fastening the\nfirst bundle. \"This says thirty-five thousand--profit from a blockade\nrunner's trip.\"\n\n\"Thirty-five thousand! Well, I think that that is just too much,\" Ricky\nsaid defiantly. \"Why didn't they get paid in real money?\"\n\n\"Being loyal to the South, the Ralestones probably would not take what\nyou call 'real money,'\" replied Charity.\n\n\"It's nice to know how wealthy we once were,\" Val observed. \"What are\nyou going to do with that wall-paper, Rupert?\"\n\n\"Oh, chuck it in my desk. I'll get someone to look it over; there might\nbe a collector's item among these bills. Now let's have the joker out of\n_this_ bundle.\" He plucked at the fastenings of the felt bag.\n\nWhen he had pulled off its wrappings, a silver tray with coffee- and\nchocolate-pot, cream pitcher and sugar bowl stood, tarnished and dingy,\non the floor.\n\n\"That's more like it.\" Ricky picked up the chocolate-pot. \"Do you\nsuppose it will ever be possible to get these clean again?\"\n\n\"With a lot of will power and some good hard rubbing it can be done,\"\nVal assured her.\n\n\"Well, I'll supply the will power and you may do the rubbing,\" she\nannounced pleasantly.\n\nRupert had opened the remaining packages to display a set of twelve\nsilver goblets, one with a dented edge, and a queerly shaped vessel not\nunlike an old-fashioned gravy-boat. Charity picked this up and examined\nit gravely.\n\n\"I'm afraid that this is pirate loot.\" She tapped the lip of the piece\nshe held. The metal gave off a clear ringing sound. \"If I'm not\nmistaken, this was stolen from a church. Yes, I'm right; see this cross\nunder the leaves?\" She pointed out the bit of engraving.\n\n\"Black Dick's work,\" agreed Ricky complacently. \"But after almost three\nhundred years I'm afraid we can't return it. Especially since we don't\nknow where it came from in the first place.\"\n\nVal looked about at what they had uncovered. \"If you are going to take\nall of this in to LeFleur, you'll have to get a truck. D'you know, I\nthink this place might turn out to be a gold-mine if one knew just where\nto dig.\"\n\n\"We haven't found the Luck yet,\" reminded Ricky.\n\nVal got clumsily to his feet and then gave Charity a hand up, beating\nRupert to it by about three seconds. \"As we don't even know whether it\nis still in existence, there's no use in hunting for it,\" Val retorted.\n\nRicky smiled, that set little smile which usually meant that she neither\nagreed with nor approved of the speaker. She got up from the floor and\nshook out her skirt purposefully.\n\n\"I'll remind you of that some day,\" she promised.\n\n\"I suppose,\" Rupert glanced at the silver, \"this ought to be taken to\ntown as soon as possible. This house is too isolated to harbor both us\nand the silverware at the same time. What do you think?\" Ignoring both\nRicky and Val, he turned to Charity.\n\n\"You are right. But it seems a pity to send it all away before we have a\nchance to rub it up and see what it really looks like!\"\n\n\"By all means, take it at once!\" Val urged promptly. \"We can always\nclean it later.\"\n\nRupert grinned. \"Now that might be a protest against the suggestion\nRicky made a few minutes ago. But I'll save you some honest labor this\ntime, Val; I'll take it to town this afternoon.\"\n\nRicky laughed softly.\n\n\"And why the merriment?\" her younger brother inquired suspiciously.\n\n\"I was just thinking what a surprise the visitor who dropped his\nhandkerchief here is going to get when he finds the cupboard bare,\" she\nexplained.\n\nRupert rubbed his palm across his chin. \"Of course. I had almost\nforgotten that.\"\n\n\"Well, I haven't! And I wonder if we have found what he--or they--were\nhunting,\" Val mused as he helped Rupert wrap up the spoil again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nGREAT-UNCLE RICK WALKS THE HALL\n\n\nSam had produced a horse complete with saddle and a reputed\nskittishness. That horse was the pride of Sam's big heart. It had once\nwon a small purse at some country fair or something of the sort, and\nsince then it had been kept only to wear the saddle at rare intervals.\nNot that Sam ever rode. He drove a spring-board behind a thin, sorrowful\nmule called \"Suggah.\" But the saddle horse was rented at times to white\nfolk of whom Sam approved.\n\nSoon after the arrival of the Ralestones at Pirate's Haven, Sam had\nbrought this four-footed prodigy to their attention. But claiming that\nthe family were his \"folks,\" he indignantly refused to accept hire and\nwas hurt if one of them did not ride at least once a day. Ricky had\ndeveloped an interest in the garden and had accepted the loan of Sam's\neldest son, an earth-brown child about as tall as the spade, to help her\nmess about. Rupert spent the largest part of his days shut up in\nBluebeard's chamber. Which of course left the horse to Val.\n\nAnd Val was becoming slightly bored with Louisiana, at least with that\nportion of it which immediately surrounded them. Charity was hard at\nwork on her picture of the swamp hunter, for Jeems had come back without\nwarning from his mysterious concerns in the swamp. There was no one to\ntalk to and nowhere to go.\n\nLeFleur had notified them that he believed he was on the track of some\ndiscreditable incident in the past of their rival which would banish him\nfrom their path. And no more handkerchiefs had been found, ownerless, in\ntheir hall. It was a serene morning.\n\nBut, Val thought long afterwards, he should have been warned by that\nvery serenity and remembered the old saying, that it was always calmest\nbefore a storm. On the contrary, he was riding Sam's horse along the\nedge of that swamp, wondering what lay hidden back in that dark jungle.\nSome day, he determined, he would do a little exploring in that\ndirection.\n\nA heron arose from the bayou and streaked across the metallic blue of\nthe sky. Another was wading along, intent upon its fishing. Sam's yellow\ndog, which had followed horse and rider, set up a barking, annoyed at\nthe haughty carriage of the bird. He scrambled down the steep bank,\ndrove it into flight after its fellow.\n\nVal pulled his shirt away from his sticky skin and wondered if he would\never feel really cool again. There was something about this damp heat\nwhich seemed to remove all ambition. He marveled how Ricky could even\nthink of trimming roses that morning.\n\nSam's dog began to bark deafeningly again, and Val looked around for the\nheron which must have aroused his displeasure. There was none. But\nacross the swamp crawled an ungainly monster.\n\nFour great rubber-tired wheels, ten feet high, as he later learned,\nsupported a metal framework upon which squatted two men and the driver\nof the monstrosity. With the ponderous solemnity of a tank it came on to\nthe bayou.\n\nVal's mount snorted and his ears pricked back. He began to have very\ndefinite ideas about what he saw. The thing slipped down the marshy bank\nand took to the water with ease, turning its square nose downstream and\nsending waves shoreward.\n\n\"Ride 'em, cowboy!\" yelled one of the men derisively as Sam's horse\ndecided to stand on his hind legs and wave at the strange apparition as\nit went by. Val brought him down upon four feet again, and he stood\nsweating, his ears still back.\n\n\"What do you call that?\" the boy shouted back.\n\n\"Prospecting engine for swamp use,\" answered the driver. \"Don't you\nswampers ever get the news?\"\n\nThe car, or whatever it was, moved on downstream and so out of sight.\n\n\"Now I wonder what that was,\" Val said aloud as his mount sidled toward\nthe center of the road. The hound-dog came up and sat down to kick a\npatch of flea-invaded territory which lay behind his left ear. Again the\nmorning was quiet.\n\nBut not for long. A mud-spattered car came around the bend in the road\nand headed at Val, going a good pace for the dirt surfacing. Before it\nquite reached him it stopped and the driver stuck his head out of the\nwindow.\n\n\"Hey, you, move over! Whatya tryin' to do--break somebody's neck?\"\n\nVal surveyed him with interest. The man was, perhaps, Rupert's age, a\nsmall, thin fellow with thick black hair and the white seam of an old\nscar beneath his left eye.\n\n\"This is,\" the boy replied, \"a private road.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he snarled, \"I know. And I'm the owner. So get your hobby-horse\ngoing and beat it, kid.\"\n\nVal shifted in the saddle and stared down at him.\n\n\"And what might your name be?\" he asked softly.\n\n\"What d'yuh think it is? Hitler? I'm Ralestone, the owner of this place.\nOn your way, kid, on your way.\"\n\n\"So? Well, good morning, cousin.\" Val tightened rein.\n\nThe invader eyed him cautiously. \"What d'yuh mean--cousin?\"\n\n\"I happen to be a Ralestone also,\" the boy answered grimly.\n\n\"Huh? You the guy who thinks he owns this?\" he asked aggressively.\n\n\"My brother is the present master of Pirate's Haven--\"\n\n\"That's what _he_ thinks,\" replied the rival with a relish. \"Well, he\nisn't. That is, not until he pays me for my half. And if he wants to get\ntough, I'll take it all,\" he ended, and withdrew into the car like a\nlizard into its rock den.\n\nVal sat by the side of the road and watched the car slide along toward\nthe plantation. As it passed him he caught a glimpse of a second\npassenger in the back seat. It was the red-faced man he had seen with\nLeFleur's clerk on the street in New Orleans. Resolutely Val turned back\nand started for the house in the wake of the rival.\n\nBy making use of a short-cut, he reached the front of the house almost\nas soon as the car. Ricky had been working with the morning-glory vines\nabout the terrace steps, young Sam standing attendance with a rusty\ntrowel and one of the kitchen forks.\n\nAt the sound of the car she stood up and tried to brush a smear of\nsticky earth from the front of her checked-gingham dress. When the rival\ngot out she smiled at him.\n\n\"Hello, sister,\" he smirked.\n\nShe stood still for a moment and her smile faded. When she answered, her\nvoice was chill. \"You wished to see Mr. Ralestone?\" she asked distantly.\n\n\"Sure. But not just yet, sister. You better be pleasant, you know. I'm\nthe new owner here--\"\n\nVal rode out of the bushes and swung out of the saddle, coming up behind\nhim. Although the boy was one of the smaller \"Black\" Ralestones, he\ntopped the invader by a good two inches, and he noted this with delight\nas he came up to him.\n\n\"Ricky,\" he said briefly, \"go in. And send Sam for Rupert.\"\n\nShe nodded and was gone. The man turned to face Val. \"You again, huh?\"\nhe demanded.\n\n\"Yes. And Ralestone or no Ralestone, I would advise you to keep a civil\ntongue in your head,\" he began hotly, when Rupert appeared at the door.\n\n\"Well, Val,\" he asked, a frown creasing his forehead, \"what is it?\"\n\nThe rival advanced a short step and looked up. \"So this is the guy who's\ntrying to do me out of my rights?\"\n\nRupert reached behind him and closed the screen before coming to the\nhead of the terrace steps. \"I presume that you are Mr. Ralestone?\" he\nasked quietly.\n\n\"'Course I'm Ralestone,\" asserted the other. \"And I'm part owner of this\nplace.\"\n\n\"That has not yet been decided,\" answered Rupert calmly. \"But suppose\nyou tell me to what we owe the honor of this visit?\"\n\nNow, however, the passenger took a hand in the game. He crawled out of\nthe car, taking off his soiled panama to wipe his bald head with a gaudy\nsilk handkerchief.\n\n\"Here, here, Mr. Ralestone,\" he addressed his companion, \"let us have no\nunpleasantness. We have merely come here today, sir,\" he explained to\nRupert, \"to see if matters could not be settled amicably without having\nto take recourse to a court of law. Your Mr. LeFleur will give us very\nlittle satisfaction, you see. I am a plain and honest man, sir, and I\nbelieve an affair of this kind may be best agreed upon between\nprincipals. My client, Mr. Ralestone, is a reasonable man; he will be\nmoderate in his demands. It will be to your advantage to listen to our\nproposal. After all, you cannot contest his rights--\"\n\n\"But that is just what I am going to do.\" Rupert smiled down at them, if\na slight twist of the lips may be called a smile. \"Have you ever heard\nthat old saying that 'possession is nine points of the law'? I am the\nRalestone in residence, and I shall continue to be the Ralestone in\nresidence until after this case is heard. Now, as I am a busy man and\nthis is the middle of the morning, I shall have to say good-bye--\"\n\n\"So that's the way you're going to take it?\" The visiting Ralestone\nglared at Rupert. \"All right. Play it that way and you won't be here a\nmonth from now. Nor,\" he turned on Val, \"this kid brother of yours,\neither. You can't pull this lord-of-the-land stuff on me and get away\nwith it. I'll--\" But he did not finish his threat. Instead, his jaws\nclamped shut on mid-word. In silence he turned and got into the car to\nwhich his counselor had already withdrawn.\n\nThe car leaped forward into a rose bush. With a savage twist of the\nwheel the driver brought it back to the drive, leaving deep prints in\nthe front lawn. Then it was gone, down the drive, as they stood staring\nafter it.\n\n\"So that's that,\" Val commented. \"Well, all I've got to say is that\nRick's branch of the family has sadly gone to seed--\"\n\n\"Being a southern gentleman has made you slightly snobbish.\" Ricky came\nout from her lurking place behind the door.\n\n\"Snobbish!\" her brother choked at the injustice. \"I suppose that that is\nyour idea of a perfect gentleman, a diamond in the rough--\"\n\nHe pointed down the drive.\n\nRicky laughed. \"It's so easy to tease you, Val. Of course he is a--a\nwart of the first class. But Rupert will fix him--won't you?\"\n\nHer older brother grinned. \"After that example of your trust in me, I'll\nhave to. I agree, he is not the sort you would care to introduce to your\nmore particular friends. But this visit seems to suggest something--\"\n\n\"That he has the wind up?\" Val asked.\n\n\"There are indications of that, I think. Something LeFleur has done has\nstirred our friends into direct action. We shall probably have more of\nit within the immediate future. So I want you, Ricky, to go to town.\nMadame LeFleur has very kindly offered to put you up--\"\n\nEach tiny curl on Ricky's head seemed to bristle with indignation. \"Oh,\nno you don't, Rupert Ralestone! You don't get me away from here when\nthere are exciting things going on. I hardly think that our friend with\nthe slimy manner will use machine-guns to blast us out. And if he\ndoes--well, it wouldn't be the first time that this house was used as a\nfortress. I'm not going one step out of here unless you two come with\nme.\"\n\nRupert shrugged. \"As I can't very well hog-tie you to get you to town, I\nsuppose you will have to stay. But I _am_ going to send for Lucy.\" With\nthat parting shot he turned and went in.\n\nLucy arrived shortly before noon. She was accompanied by a portion of\nher large family--four, Val counted, including that Sam who had become\nRicky's faithful shadow.\n\n\"What's all dis Ah heah 'bout some mans sayin' he am de Ralestone?\" she\ndemanded of Ricky. \"De policemans oughta lock him up. Effen he comes\nbotherin' 'roun' heah agin I'll ten' to him!\"\n\nWith that she marched majestically into the kitchen, elbowed Letty-Lou\nout of her way, and proceeded to stir up a batch of brown molasses\ncookies. \"'Cause dey is fillin' fo' boys. An' Mistuh Val, heah, he needs\nsome moah fat 'crost dose skinny ribs. Letty-Lou, yo'all ain't feedin'\ndese men-folks ri'. Now yo' chillens,\" she swooped down upon her own\nfamily, \"yo'all gits outa heah an' don't fuss me.\"\n\n\"They can come with me,\" offered Ricky. \"I'm trying to find that maze\nwhich is marked on the garden plans.\"\n\n\"Miss 'Chanda, yo'all ain't a'goin' 'way 'afo' yoah brothah gits through\nhis wo'k. He done tol' me to keep an eye on yo'all. Why don't yo'all go\nvisit wi' Miss Charity?\"\n\nRicky looked at her watch. \"All right. She'll be through her morning\nwork by now. I'll take the children, Lucy.\"\n\nTo Val's open surprise, she obeyed Lucy, meekly moving off without a\nsingle protest. One of the boys remained behind and offered shyly to\ntake the horse back to Sam's place. When Lucy agreed that it would be\nall right, Val boosted him into the saddle where he clung like a jockey.\n\n\"An' wheah is yo'all goin', Mistuh Val?\" asked Lucy, cutting out round\ncookies with a downward stroke of the drinking glass she had pressed\ninto service. The regular cutter was, in her opinion, too small.\n\n\"Down toward the bayou. I'll be back before lunch,\" he said, and hurried\nout before she could as definitely dispose of him as she had of Ricky.\n\nVal struck off into the bushes until he came to one of the paths that\ncrossed the wilderness. As it ran in the direction of the bayou, he\nturned into it. Then for the second time he came into the glen of the\npool and passed along the path Jeems had known. So somehow Val was not\nsurprised, when he came out upon the edge of the bayou levee, to see\nJeems sitting there.\n\n\"Hello!\"\n\nThe swamper looked up at Val's hail but this time he did not leave.\n\n\"Hullo,\" he answered sullenly.\n\nVal stood there, ill at ease, while the swamper eyed him composedly.\nWhat could he say now? Val's embarrassment must have been very apparent,\nfor after a long moment Jeems smiled derisively.\n\n\"Yo' goin' ridin' in them funny pants?\" he asked, pointing to the\nother's breeches.\n\n\"Well, that's what they are intended for,\" Val replied.\n\n\"Wheah's youah hoss?\"\n\n\"I sent him back to Sam's.\" Val was beginning to feel slightly warm. He\ndecided that Jeems' manners were not all that they might be.\n\n\"Sam!\" the swamp boy spat into the water. \"He's a--\"\n\nBut what Sam was, in the opinion of the swamper, Val never learned, for\nat that moment Ricky burst from between two bushes.\n\n\"Well, at last,\" she panted, \"I've gotten rid of my army. Val, do you\nthink that Lucy is going to be like this all the time--order us about, I\nmean?\"\n\n\"Who's that?\" Jeems was on his feet looking at Ricky.\n\n\"Ricky,\" her brother said, \"this is Jeems. My sister Richanda.\"\n\n\"Yo' one of the folks up at the big house?\" he asked her directly.\n\n\"Why, yes,\" she answered simply.\n\n\"Yo' don' act like yo' was.\" He stabbed his finger at both of them. \"Yo'\ndon't walk with youah noses in the air looking down at us--\"\n\n\"Of course we don't!\" interrupted Ricky. \"Why should we, when you know\nmore about this place than we do?\"\n\n\"What do yo' mean by that?\" he flashed out at her, his sullen face\nsuddenly dark.\n\n\"Why--why--\" Ricky faltered, \"Charity Biglow said that you knew all\nabout the swamp--\"\n\nHis tense position relaxed a fraction. \"Oh, yo' know Miss Charity?\"\n\n\"Yes. She showed us the picture she is painting, the one you are posing\nfor,\" Ricky went on.\n\n\"Miss Charity is a fine lady,\" he returned with conviction. He shifted\nfrom one bare foot to the other. \"Ah'll be goin' now.\" With no other\nfarewell he slipped over the side of the levee into his canoe and headed\nout into midstream. Nor did he look back.\n\nLucy departed after dinner that evening to bed down her family before\nreturning with Letty-Lou to occupy one of the servant's rooms over the\nside wing. Rupert had gone with her to interview Sam. Val gathered that\nSam had some notion of trying to reintroduce the growing of indigo, a\ncrop which had been forsaken for sugar-cane at the beginning of the\nnineteenth century when a pest had destroyed the entire indigo crop of\nthat year all over Louisiana.\n\n\"Let's go out in the garden,\" suggested Ricky.\n\n\"What for?\" asked her brother. \"To provide a free banquet for\nmosquitoes? No, thank you, let's stay here.\"\n\n\"You're lazy,\" she countered.\n\n\"You may call it laziness; I call it prudence,\" he answered.\n\n\"Well, I'm going anyway,\" she made a decision which brought Val\nreluctantly to his feet. For mosquitoes or no mosquitoes, he was not\ngoing to allow Ricky to be outside alone.\n\nThey followed the path which led around the side of the house until it\nneared the kitchen door. When they reached that point Ricky halted.\n\n\"Listen!\"\n\nA plaintive miaow sounded from the kitchen.\n\n\"Oh, bother! Satan's been left inside. Go and let him out.\"\n\n\"Will you stay right here?\" Val asked.\n\n\"Of course. Though I don't see why you and Rupert have taken to acting\nas if Fu Manchu were loose in our yard. Now hurry up before he claws the\nscreen to pieces. Satan, I mean, not the worthy Chinese gentleman.\"\n\nBut Satan did not meet Val at the door. Apparently, having received no\nimmediate answer to his plea, he had withdrawn into the bulk of the\nhouse. Speaking unkind things about him under his breath, Val started\nacross the dark kitchen.\n\nSuddenly he stopped. He felt the solid edge of the table against his\nthigh. When he put out his hand he touched the reassuring everyday form\nof Lucy's stone cooky jar. He was in their own pleasant everyday\nkitchen.\n\nBut--\n\nHe was not alone in that house!\n\nThere had been the faintest of sounds from the forepart of the main\nsection, a sound such as Satan might have caused. But Val knew--knew\npositively--that Satan was guiltless. Someone or something was in the\nLong Hall.\n\nHe crept by the table, hoping that he could find his way without running\ninto anything. His hand closed upon the knob of the door opening upon\nthe back stairs used by Letty-Lou. If he could get up them and across\nthe upper hall, he could come down the front stairs and catch the\nintruder.\n\nIt took Val perhaps two minutes to reach the head of the front stairs,\nand each minute seemed a half-hour in length. From below he could hear a\nregular _pad, pad_, as if from stocking feet on the stone floor. He drew\na deep breath and started down.\n\nWhen he reached the landing he looked over the rail. Upright before the\nfireplace was a dim white blur. As he watched, it moved forward. There\nwas something uncanny about that almost noiseless movement.\n\nThe blur became a thin figure clad in baggy white breeches and loose\nshirt. Below the knees the legs seemed to fade into the darkness of the\nhall and there was something strange about the outlines of the head.\n\nAgain the thing resumed its padding and Val saw now that it was pacing\nthe hall in a regular pattern. Which suggested that it was human and was\nthere with a very definite purpose.\n\nHe edged farther down the stairs.\n\n\"And just what are you doing?\"\n\nIf his voice quavered upon the last word, it was hardly his fault. For\nwhen the thing turned, Val saw--\n\nIt had no face!\n\nWith a startled cry he lunged forward, clutching at the banister to\nsteady his blundering descent. The thing backed away; already it was\nfading into the darkness beside the stairs. As Val's feet touched the\nfloor of the hall he caught his last glimpse of it, a thin white patch\nagainst the solid paneling of the stairway's broad side. Then it was\ngone. When Rupert and Ricky came in a few minutes later and turned on\nthe lights, Val was still staring at that blank wall, with Satan rubbing\nagainst his ankles.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nPORTRAIT OF A LADY AND A GENTLEMAN\n\n\nRupert had dismissed Val's story of what he had seen in the hall in a\nvery lofty manner. When his brother had persisted in it, Rupert\nsuggested that Val had better keep out of the sun in the morning. For no\ntrace of the thing which had troubled the house remained.\n\nRicky hesitated between believing wholly in Val's tale or just in his\npowers of imagination. And between them his family drove him sulky to\nbed. He was still frowning, or maybe it was a new frown, when he looked\ninto the bathroom mirror the next morning as he dressed. For Val knew\nthat he _had_ seen something in the hall, something monstrous which had\nno right to be there.\n\nWhat had their rival said before he left? \"Play it that way and you\nwon't be here a month from now.\" It was just possible--Val paused, half\nin, half out of, his shirt. Could last night's adventure have had\nanything to do with that threat? Two or three episodes of that sort\nmight unsettle the strongest nerves and drive the occupants from a house\nwhere such a shadow walked.\n\nSomething else nagged at the boy's memory. Slowly he traced back over\nthe events of the day before, from the moment when he had watched that\nqueer swamp car crawl downstream. After the visit of the rival, Lucy had\ncome to stay. And then Ricky had started for Charity's while he had gone\ndown to the bayou where he met Jeems. That was it. Jeems!\n\nWhen Ricky had hinted that he knew more of the swamp than the Ralestones\ndid, why had he been so quick to resent that remark? Could it be because\nhe understood her to mean that he knew more of Pirate's Haven than they\ndid?\n\nAnd the thing in the Long Hall last night had known of some exit in the\nwall that the Ralestones did not know of. It had faded into the base of\nthe staircase. And yet, when Val had gone over the paneling there inch\nby inch, he had gained nothing but sore finger tips.\n\nHe tucked his shirt under his belt and looked down to see if Sam Junior\nhad polished his boots as Lucy had ordered her son to do. Save for a\ntrace of mud by the right heel, they had the proper mirror-like surface.\n\n\"Mistuh Val,\" Lucy's penetrating voice made him start guiltily, \"is yo'\nor is yo' not comin' to brekfas'?\"\n\n\"I am,\" he answered and started downstairs at his swiftest pace.\n\nThe new ruler of their household was standing at the foot of the stairs,\nher knuckles resting on her broad hips. She eyed the boy sternly. Lucy\neyed one, Val thought, much as a Scotch nurse Ricky and he had once had.\nThey had never dared question any of Annie's decrees, and one look from\nher had been enough to reduce them to instant order. Lucy's eye had the\nsame power. And now as she herded Val into the dining-room he felt like\na six-year-old with an uneasy conscience.\n\nRupert and Ricky were already seated and eating. That is, Ricky was\neating, but Rupert was reading his morning mail.\n\n\"Yo'all sits down,\" said Lucy firmly, \"an' yo'all eats what's on youah\nplate. Yo'all ain' much fattah nor a jay-bird.\"\n\n\"I don't see why she keeps comparing me to a living skeleton all the\ntime,\" Val complained as she departed kitchenward.\n\n\"She told Letty-Lou yesterday,\" supplied Ricky through a mouthful of\npopover, \"that you are 'peaked lookin'.\"\n\n\"Why doesn't she start in on Rupert? He needs another ten pounds or so.\"\nVal reached for the butter. \"And he hasn't got a very good color,\neither.\" Val surveyed his brother professionally. \"Doesn't get outdoors\nenough.\"\n\n\"No,\" Ricky's voice sounded aggrieved, \"he's too busy having secrets--\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" Rupert murmured, more interested in his letter than in the\nconversation.\n\n\"The trouble is that we are not Chinese bandits, Malay pirates, or Arab\nfreebooters. We don't possess color, life, enough--enough--\"\n\n\"Sugar,\" Rupert interrupted Val, pushing his coffee-cup in the general\ndirection of Ricky without raising his eyes from the page in his hand.\nShe giggled.\n\n\"So that's what we lack. Well, now we know. How much sugar should we\nhave, Rupert? Rupert--Mr. Rupert Ralestone--Mr. Rupert Ralestone of\nPirate's Haven!\" Her voice grew louder and shriller until he did lay\ndown his reading matter and really looked at them for the first time.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"A little attention,\" answered Ricky sweetly. \"We aren't Chinese, Arabs,\nor Malays, but we are kind of nice to know, aren't we, Val? If you'd\nonly come out of your subconscious, or wherever you are most of the\ntime, you'd find that out without being told.\"\n\nRupert laughed and pushed away his letters. \"Sorry. I picked up the bad\nhabit of reading at breakfast when I didn't have my table brightened by\nyour presence. I know,\" he became serious, \"that I haven't been much of\na family man. But there are reasons--\"\n\n\"Which, of course, you can not tell _us_,\" flashed Ricky.\n\nHis face lengthened ruefully. He pulled at his tie with an embarrassed\nfrown. \"Not yet, anyway. I--\" He fumbled with his napkin. \"Oh, well, let\nme see how it comes out first.\"\n\nRicky opened her eyes to their widest extent and leaned forward, every\ninch of her expressing awe. \"Rupert, don't tell me that you are an\n_inventor_!\" she cried.\n\n\"Now I know that we'll end in the poorhouse,\" Val observed.\n\nRupert had recovered his composure. \"'I yam what I yam,'\" he quoted.\n\n\"Very well. Keep it to yourself then,\" pouted Ricky. \"We can have\nsecrets too.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt it.\" He glanced at Val. \"Unfortunately you always tell\nthem. See any more bogies last night, Val? Did a big, black, formless\nsomething reach out from under the bed and clutch at you?\"\n\nBut his brother refused to be drawn. \"No, but when it does I'll sic it\nonto you. A big, black, formless something is just what you need. And\nI'll--\"\n\n\"Am I interrupting?\" Charity stood in the door. \"Goodness! Haven't you\nfinished breakfast yet? Do you people know that it is almost ten?\"\n\n\"Madam, we have banished time.\" Rupert drew out the chair at his left.\n\"Will you favor us with your company?\"\n\n\"I thought you were going to be busy today,\" said Ricky as she rang for\nLetty-Lou and a fresh cup of coffee for their guest.\n\n\"So did I,\" sighed Charity. \"And I should be. I've got this order, you\nknow, and now I can't get any models. Why there should be a sudden\ndearth of them right now, I can't imagine. I thought I could use Jeems\nagain, but somehow he isn't the type.\" She raised her cup to her lips.\n\n\"Are you doing story illustrations?\" asked Rupert, more alive now than\nhe had been all morning.\n\n\"Yes. A historical thriller for a magazine. They want a full-page cut\nfor the first chapter and a half-page to illustrate the most exciting\nscene. Then there're innumerable smaller ones. But the two large ones\nare what I'm worrying about. I like to get the important stuff finished\nfirst, and now I simply can't get models who are the right types.\"\n\n\"What's the story about?\" demanded Ricky.\n\n\"It's laid in Haiti during the French invasion led by Napoleon's\nbrother-in-law, the one who married Pauline. All voodoo and aristocratic\nyoung hero and beautiful maiden pursued by an officer of the black\nrebels. And,\" she almost wailed, \"here I am with the clothes spread all\nover my bed--the right costumes, you know--with no one to wear them. I\nwent over to the Corners this morning and called Johnson--he runs a\nregistration office for models--but he couldn't promise me anyone.\" She\nbit absent-mindedly into a round spiced roll Ricky had placed before\nher.\n\n\"Wait!\" She laid down the roll in a preoccupied fashion and stared\nacross the table. \"Val, stand up.\"\n\nWondering, he pushed back his chair and arose obediently.\n\n\"Turn your head a little more to the right,\" Charity ordered. \"There,\nthat's it! Now try to look as if there were something all ready to\nspring at you from that corner over there.\"\n\nFor one angry moment he thought that she had been told of what had\nhappened the night before and was baiting him, as the others had done.\nBut a sidewise glance showed him that her interest lay elsewhere. So he\nscrewed up his features into what he fondly hoped was a grim and deadly\nsmile.\n\n\"For goodness sake, don't look as if you had eaten green apples,\" Ricky\nshot at him. \"Just put on that face you wear when I show you a new hat.\nNo, not that sneering one; the other.\"\n\nRupert threw back his head and laughed heartily. \"Better let him alone,\nRicky. After all, it's _his_ face.\"\n\n\"I'm glad that someone has pointed out that fact,\" Val said stiffly,\n\"because--\"\n\n\"Oh, be quiet!\" Charity leaned forward across the table. \"Yes,\" she\nnodded, \"you'll do.\"\n\n\"For what?\" Val asked, slightly apprehensive.\n\n\"For my hero. Of course your hair is too short and you are rather too\nyouthful, but I can disguise those points. And,\" she turned upon Ricky,\n\"you can be the lady in distress. Which gives me another idea. Do you\nsuppose that I might use your terrace for a background and have that big\nchair, the one with the high back?\" she asked Rupert.\n\n\"You may have anything you want within these walls,\" he answered lightly\nenough, but it was clear that he really meant it.\n\n\"What am I supposed to do?\" Val asked.\n\nCharity considered. \"I think I'll try the action one first,\" she said\nhalf to herself. \"That's going to be the most difficult. Ricky, will you\nsend one of Lucy's children over with me to help carry back the costumes\nand my material--\" She was already at the door.\n\n\"Val and I will go instead,\" Ricky replied.\n\nSome twenty minutes later Val was handed a suitcase and told to use the\ncontents to cover his back. Having doubts of the wisdom of the whole\naffair, he went reluctantly upstairs to obey. But the result was not so\nbad. The broad-shouldered, narrow-waisted coat did not fit him ill,\nthough the shiny boots were at least a size too large. Timidly he went\ndown. Ricky was the first to see him.\n\n\"Val! You look like something out of _Lloyds of London_. Rupert, look at\nVal. Doesn't he look wonderful?\"\n\nHaving thus made public his embarrassment, she ran to the mirror to\nfinish her own prinking. The high-waisted Empire gown of soft green\nvoile made her appear taller than usual. But she walked with a little\nshuffle which suggested that her ribbon-strapped slippers fitted her no\nbetter than Val's boots did him. Charity was coaxing Ricky's tight\nfashionable curls into a looser arrangement and tying a green ribbon\nabout them. This done, she turned to survey Val.\n\n\"I thought so,\" she said with satisfaction. \"You are just what I want.\nBut,\" the tiny lines about her eyes crinkled in amusement, \"at present\nyou are just a little too perfect. Do you realize that you have just\nfought off an attack, led by a witch doctor, in which you were wounded;\nthat you have struggled through a jungle for seven hours in order to\nreach your betrothed; and that you are now facing death by torture? I\nhardly think that you should look as if you had just stepped out of the\ntailor's--\"\n\n\"I've done all that?\" Val demanded, somewhat staggered.\n\n\"Well, the author says you have, so you've got to look it. We'd better\nmuss you up a bit. Let's see.\" She tapped her fingernail against her\nteeth as she looked him up and down. \"Off with that coat first.\"\n\nHe wriggled out of the coat and stood with the glories of his ruffled\nshirt fully displayed. \"Now what?\" he asked.\n\n\"This,\" she reached forward and ripped his left sleeve to the shoulder.\n\"Untie that cravat and take it off. Roll up your other sleeve above the\nelbow. That's right. Ricky, you muss up his hair. Let a lock of it fall\nacross his forehead. No, not there--there. Good. Now he's ready for the\nfinal touches.\" She went to the table where her paints had been left.\n\"Let's see--carmine, that ought to be right. This is water-color, Val,\nit'll all wash off in a minute.\"\n\nAcross his smooth tanned cheek she dribbled a jagged line of scarlet.\nThen instructing Ricky to bind the torn edge of his sleeve above his\nelbow, she also stained the bandage. \"Well?\" she turned to Rupert.\n\n\"He looks as though he had been through the wars all right,\" he agreed.\n\"But what about the costume?\"\n\n\"Oh, we needn't worry about that. They knew I'd have to do this, so they\nduplicated everything. Now for you, Ricky. Pull your sleeve down off\nyour shoulder and see if you can tear the skirt up from the hem on that\nside--about as far as your knee. Yes, that's fine. You're ready now.\"\n\nRupert picked up from the table a sword and a long-barrelled dueling\npistol and led the way out onto the terrace. Charity pointed to the big\nchair in the sunlight.\n\n\"This will probably be hard for you two,\" she warned them frankly. \"If\nyou get tired, don't hesitate to tell me. I'll give you a rest every ten\nminutes. Val, you sit down in the chair. Slump over toward that arm as\nif you were about finished. No, more limp than that. Now look straight\nahead. You are on the terrace of Beauvallet. Beside you is the girl you\nlove. You are all that stands between her and the black rebels. Now take\nthis sword in your right hand and the pistol in your left. Lean forward\na little. There! Now don't move; you've got just the pose I want. Ricky,\ncrouch down by the side of his chair with your arm up so that you can\ntouch his hand. You're terrified. There's death, horrible death, before\nyou!\"\n\nVal could feel Ricky's hand quiver against his. Charity had made them\nboth see and feel what she wanted them to. They weren't in the peaceful\nsunlight on the terrace of Pirate's Haven; they were miles farther south\nin the dark land of Haiti, the Haiti of more than a hundred years ago.\nBefore them was a semitropical forest from which at any moment might\ncrawl--death. Val's hand tightened on the sword hilt; the pistol butt\nwas clammy in his grip.\n\nRupert had put up the easel and laid out the paints. And now, taking up\nher charcoal, Charity began to sketch with clear, clean strokes.\n\nHer models' unaccustomed muscles cramped so that when they shifted\nduring their rest periods they grimaced with pain. Ricky whispered that\nshe did not wonder models were hard to get. After a while Rupert went\naway without Charity noticing his leaving. The sun burned Val's cheek\nwhere the paint had dried and he felt a trickle of moisture edge down\nhis spine. But Charity worked on, thoroughly intent upon what was\ngrowing under her brushes.\n\nIt must have been close to noon when she was at last interrupted.\n\n\"Hello there, Miss Biglow!\"\n\nTwo men stood below the terrace on a garden path. One of them waved his\nhat as Charity looked around. And behind them stood Jeems.\n\n\"Go away,\" said the worker, \"go away, Judson Holmes. I haven't any time\nfor you today.\"\n\n\"Not after I've come all the way from New York to see you?\" he asked\nreproachfully. \"Why, Charity!\" He had the reddest hair Val had ever\nseen--and the homeliest face--but his small-boy grin was friendliness\nitself.\n\n\"Go away,\" she repeated stubbornly.\n\n\"Nope!\" He shook his head firmly. \"I'm staying right here until you\nforget that for at least a minute.\" He motioned toward the picture.\n\nWith a sigh she put down her brush. \"I suppose I'll have to humor you.\"\n\n\"Miss Charity,\" Jeems had not taken his eyes from the two models since\nhe had arrived and he did not move them now, \"what're they all fixed up\nlike that fur?\"\n\n\"It's a picture for a story,\" she explained. \"A story about Haiti in the\nold days--\"\n\n\"Ah reckon Ah know,\" he nodded eagerly, his face suddenly alight.\n\"That's wheah th' blacks kilt th' French back in history times. Ah got\nme a book 'bout it. A book in handwritin', not printin'. P\u00e8re Armand\nlarned me to read it.\"\n\nJudson Holmes' companion moved forward. \"A book in handwriting,\" he said\nslowly. \"Could that possibly mean a diary?\"\n\nCharity was wiping her hands on a paint rag. \"It might. New Orleans was\na port of refuge for a great many of the French who fled the island\nduring the slave uprising. It is not impossible.\"\n\n\"I've got to see it! Here, boy, what's your name?\" He pounced upon\nJeems. \"Can you get that book here this afternoon?\"\n\nJeems drew back. \"Ah ain't gonna bring no book heah. That's mine an' you\nain't gonna set eye on it!\" With that parting shot he was gone.\n\n\"But--but--\" protested the other, \"I've got to see it. Why, such a find\nmight be priceless.\"\n\nMr. Holmes laughed. \"Curb your hunting instincts for once, Creighton.\nYou can't handle a swamper that way. Let's go and see Charity's\nmasterpiece instead.\"\n\n\"I don't remember having asked you to,\" she observed.\n\n\"Oh, see here now, wasn't I the one who got you this commission? And\nCreighton here is that strange animal known as a publisher's scout. And\npublishers sometimes desire the services of illustrators, so you had\nbetter impress Creighton as soon as possible. Well,\" he looked at the\npicture, \"you have done it!\"\n\nEven Creighton, who had been inclined to stare back over his shoulder at\nthe point where Jeems disappeared, now gave it more than half his\nattention.\n\n\"Is that for _Drums of Doom_?\" he asked becoming suddenly crisp and\nprofessional.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Might do for the jacket of the book. Have Mr. Richards see this.\nMarvelous types, where did you get them?\" he continued, looking from the\ncanvas to Ricky and Val.\n\n\"Oh, I am sorry. Miss Ralestone, may I present Mr. Creighton, and Mr.\nHolmes, both of New York. And this,\" she smiled at Val, \"is Mr. Valerius\nRalestone, the brother of the owner of this plantation. The family, I\nbelieve, has lived here for about two hundred and fifty years.\"\n\nCreighton's manner became a shade less brusque as he took the hand Ricky\nheld out to him. \"I might have known that no professional could get that\nlook,\" he said.\n\n\"Then this isn't your place?\" Mr. Holmes said to Charity after he had\ngreeted the Ralestones.\n\n\"Mine? Goodness no! I rent the old overseer's house. Pirate's Haven is\nRalestone property.\"\n\n\"Pirate's Haven.\" Judson Holmes' infectious grin reappeared. \"A rather\nsuggestive name.\"\n\n\"The builder intended to name it 'King's Acres' because it was a royal\ngrant,\" Val informed him. \"But he was a pirate, so the other name was\ngiven it by the country folk and he adopted it. And he was right in\ndoing so because there were other freebooters in the family after his\ntime.\"\n\n\"Yes, we are even equipped with a pirate ghost,\" contributed Ricky with\na mischievous glance in her brother's direction.\n\nHolmes fanned himself with his hat. \"So romance isn't dead after all.\nWell, Charity, shall we stay--in town I mean?\"\n\n\"Why?\" a thin line appeared between her eyes as if she had little liking\nfor such a plan.\n\n\"Well, Creighton is here on the track of a mysterious new writer who is\nthreatening to produce a second _Gone with the Wind_. And I--well, I\nlike the climate.\"\n\n\"We'll see,\" muttered Charity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nINTO THE SWAMP\n\n\nIn spite of the fact that they received but lukewarm encouragement from\nCharity, both Holmes and Creighton lingered on in New Orleans. Mr.\nCreighton made several attempts to get in touch with Jeems, whom he\nseemed to suspect of concealing vast literary treasures. And he spent\none hot morning going through the trunk of papers which the Ralestones\nhad found in the storage-room. Ricky commented upon the fact that being\na publisher's scout was almost like being an antique buyer.\n\nHolmes was a perfect foil for his laboring friend. He lounged away his\ndays draped across the settee on Charity's gallery or sitting down on\nthe bayou levee--after she had chased him away--pitching pebbles into\nthe water. He told all of them that it was his vacation, the first one\nhe had had in five years, and that he was going to make the most of it.\nCompanioned by Creighton, he usually enlarged the family circle in the\nevenings. And the tales he could tell about the far corners of the earth\nwere as wildly romantic as Rupert's--though he did assure his listeners\nthat even Tibet was very tame and well behaved nowadays.\n\nCharity had finished the first illustration and had started another.\nThis time Ricky and Val appeared polished and combed as if they had just\nstepped out of a ball-room of a governor's palace--which they had,\naccording to the story. It was during her second morning's work upon\nthis that she threw down her brush with a snort of disgust.\n\n\"It's no use,\" she told her models, \"I simply can't work on this now.\nAll I can see is that scene where the hero's mulatto half-brother\nwatches the ball from the underbrush. I've got to do that one first.\"\n\n\"Why don't you then?\" Ricky stretched to relieve cramped muscles.\n\n\"I would if I could get Jeems. He's my model for the brother. He's\nenough like you, Val, for the resemblance, and his darker tan is just\nright for color. But he won't come back while Creighton's here. I could\nwring that man's neck!\"\n\n\"But Creighton left for Milneburg this morning,\" Val reminded her.\n\"Rupert told him about the old voodoo rites which used to be celebrated\nthere on June 24th, St. John's Eve, and he wanted to see if there were\nany records--\"\n\n\"Yes. But Jeems doesn't know he's gone. If we could only get in touch\nwith him--Jeems, I mean.\"\n\n\"Miss 'Chanda!\"\n\nSam Two, as they had come to call Sam's eldest son and heir, was\nstanding on the lowest step of the terrace, holding a small covered\nbasket in his hands.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Letty-Lou done say dis am fo' yo'all, Miss 'Chanda.\"\n\n\"For me?\" Ricky looked at the offering in surprise. \"But what in the\nworld--Bring it here, Sam.\"\n\n\"Yas'm.\"\n\nHe laid the basket in Ricky's outstretched hands.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this before.\" She turned it around. \"It\nseems to be woven of some awfully fine grass--\"\n\n\"That's swamp work.\" Charity was peering over Ricky's shoulder. \"Open\nit.\"\n\nInside on a nest of raw wild cotton lay a bracelet of polished wood\ncarved with an odd design of curling lines which reminded Val of Spanish\nmoss. And with the circlet was a small purse of scaled hide.\n\n\"Swamp oak and baby alligator,\" burst out Charity. \"Aren't they\nbeauties?\"\n\n\"But who--\" began Ricky.\n\nVal picked up a scrap of paper which had fluttered to the floor. It was\ncheap stuff, ruled with faint blue lines, but the writing was bold and\nclear: \"Miss Richanda Ralestone.\"\n\n\"It's yours all right.\" He handed her the paper.\n\n\"I know.\" She tucked the note away with the gifts. \"It was Jeems.\"\n\n\"Jeems? But why?\" her brother protested.\n\n\"Well, yesterday when I was down by the levee he was coming in and I\nknew that Mr. Creighton was here and I told him. So,\" she colored\nfaintly, \"then he took me across the bayou and I got some of those big\nswamp lilies that I've always wanted. And we had a long talk. Val, Jeems\nknows the most wonderful things about the swamps. Do you know that they\nstill have voodoo meetings sometimes--way back in there,\" she swept her\nhand southward. \"And the fur trappers live on house-boats, renting their\nhunting rights. But Jeems owns his own land. Now some northerners are\nprospecting for oil. They have a queer sort of car which can travel\neither on land or water. And P\u00e8re Armand has church records that date\nback to the middle of the eighteenth century. And--\"\n\n\"So that's where you were from four until almost six,\" Val laughed. \"I\ndon't know that I approve of this riotous living. Will Jeems take me to\npick the lilies too?\"\n\n\"Maybe. He wanted to know why you always moved so carefully. And I told\nhim about the accident. Then he said the oddest thing--\" She was staring\npast Val at the oaks. \"He said that to fly was worth being smashed up\nfor and that he envied you.\"\n\n\"Then he's a fool!\" her brother said promptly. \"Nothing is worth--\" Val\nstopped abruptly. Five months before he had made a bargain with himself;\nhe was not going to break it now.\n\n\"Do you know,\" Ricky said to Charity, \"if you really need Jeems this\nmorning, I think I can get him for you. He told me yesterday how to find\nhis cabin.\"\n\n\"But why--\" The objection came almost at once from Charity. Val thought\nshe was more than a little surprised that Jeems, who had steadfastly\nrefused to give her the same information, had supplied it so readily to\nRicky whom he hardly knew at all.\n\n\"I don't know,\" answered Ricky frankly. \"He was rather queer about it.\nKept saying that the time might come when I would need help, and things\nlike that.\"\n\n\"Charity,\" Val was putting her brushes straight, \"I learned long ago\nthat nothing can be kept from Ricky. Sooner or later one spills out his\nsecrets.\"\n\n\"Except Rupert!\" Ricky aired her old grievance.\n\n\"Perhaps Rupert,\" her brother agreed.\n\n\"Anyway, I do know where Jeems lives. Do you want me to get him for you,\nCharity?\"\n\n\"Certainly not, child! Do you think that I'd let you go into the swamp?\nWhy, even men who know something of woodcraft think twice before\nattempting such a trip without a guide. Of course you're not going! I\nthink,\" she put her paint-stained hand to her head, \"that I'm going to\nhave one of my sick headaches. I'll have to go home and lie down for an\nhour or two.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" Ricky's sympathy was quick and warm. \"Is there anything I\ncan do?\"\n\nCharity shook her head with a rueful smile. \"Time is the only medicine\nfor one of these. I'll see you later.\"\n\n\"Just the same,\" Ricky stood looking after her, \"I'd like to know just\nwhat is going on in the swamp right now.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Val asked lightly.\n\n\"Because--well, just because,\" was her provoking answer. \"Jeems was so\nodd yesterday. He talked as if--as if there were some threat to us or\nhim. I wonder if there is something wrong.\" She frowned.\n\n\"Of course not!\" her brother made prompt answer. \"He's merely gone off\non one of those mysterious trips of his.\"\n\n\"Just the same, what if there were something wrong? We might go and\nsee.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" Val snapped. \"You heard what Charity said about going into\nthe swamp alone. And there is nothing to worry about anyway. Come on,\nlet's change. And then I have something to show you.\"\n\n\"What?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Wait and see.\" His ruse had succeeded. She was no longer looking\nswampward with that gleam of purpose in her eye.\n\n\"Come on then,\" she said, prodding him into action.\n\nVal changed slowly. If one didn't care about mucking around in the\ngarden, as Ricky seemed to delight in doing, there was so little in the\nway of occupation. He thought of the days as they spread before him. A\nlittle riding, a great amount of casual reading and--what else? Was the\nSouth \"getting\" him as the tropics are supposed to \"get\" the\nNortherners?\n\nThat unlucky meeting with a mountaintop had effectively despoiled him of\nhis one ambition. Soldiers with game legs are not wanted. He couldn't\npaint like Charity, he couldn't spin yarns like Rupert, he possessed a\nmind too inaccurate to cope with the intricacies of any science. And as\na business man he would probably be a good street cleaner.\n\nWhat was left? Well, the surprise he had promised Ricky might cover the\nproblem. As he reached for a certain black note-book, someone knocked on\nhis door.\n\n\"Mistuh Val, wheah's Miss 'Chanda? She ain't up heah an' Ah wan's to--\"\n\nLucy stood in the hall. The light from the round window was reflected\nfrom every corrugated wave of her painfully marcelled hair. Her vast\nflowered dress had been thriftily covered with a dull-green bib-apron\nand she had changed her smart slippers for the shapeless gray relics she\nwore indoors. Just now she looked warm and tired. After all, running two\nhouseholds was something of a task even for Lucy.\n\n\"Why, she should be in her room. We came up to change. Miss Charity's\ngone home with a headache. What was it you wanted her for?\"\n\n\"Dese heah cu'ta'ns, Mistuh Val\"--she thrust a mound of snowy and\nberuffled white stuff at him--\"dey has got to be hung. An' does Miss\n'Chanda wan' dem in her room or does she not?\"\n\n\"Better put them up. I'll tell her about it. Here wait, let me open that\ndoor.\"\n\nVal looked into Ricky's room. As usual, it appeared as though a\nwhirlwind, a small whirlwind but a thorough one, had passed through it.\nHer discarded costume lay tumbled across the bed and her slippers lay on\nthe floor, one upside down. He stooped to set them straight.\n\n\"It do beat all,\" Lucy said frankly as she put her burden down on a\nchair, \"how dat chile do mak' a mess. Now yo', Mistuh Val, jest put\neberythin' jest so. But Miss 'Chanda leave eberythin' which way afore\nSunday! Looka dat now.\" She pointed to the half-open door of the closet.\nA slip lay on the floor. Ricky must have been in a hurry; that was a\nlittle too untidy even for her.\n\nA sudden suspicion sent Val into the closet to investigate. Ricky's\nwardrobe was not so extensive that he did not know every dress and\narticle in it very well. It did not take him more than a moment to see\nwhat was missing.\n\n\"Did Ricky go riding?\" Val asked. \"Her habit is gone.\"\n\n\"She ain' gone 'cross de bayo' fo' de hoss,\" answered Lucy, reaching for\nthe curtain rod. \"An' anyway, Sam done took dat critter down de road fo'\nto be shoed.\"\n\n\"Then where--\" But Val knew his Ricky only too well.\n\nShe had a certain stubborn will of her own. Sometimes opposition merely\ndrove her into doing the forbidden thing. And the swamp had been\nforbidden. But could even Ricky be such a fool? Certain memories of the\npast testified that she could. But how? Unless she had taken Sam's\nboat--\n\nWithout a word of explanation to Lucy, he dashed out of the room and\ndownstairs at his best pace. As he left the house Val broke into a\nstumbling run. There was just a chance that she had not yet left the\nplantation.\n\nBut the bayou levee was deserted. And the post where Sam's boat was\nusually moored was bare of rope; the boat was gone. Of course Sam Two\nmight have taken it across the stream to the farm.\n\nThat hope was extinguished as the small brown boy came out of the bushes\nalong the stream side.\n\n\"Sam, have you seen Miss 'Chanda?\" Val demanded.\n\n\"Yessuh.\"\n\n\"Where?\" Carrying on a conversation with Sam Two was like prying\ndiamonds out of a rock. He possessed a rooted distaste for talking.\n\n\"Heah, suh.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Jest a li'l bitty 'go.\"\n\n\"Where did she go?\"\n\nSam pointed downstream.\n\n\"Did she take the boat?\"\n\n\"Yessuh.\" And then for the first time since Val had known him Sam\nvolunteered a piece of information. \"She done say she a-goin' in de\nswamp.\"\n\nVal leaned back against the hole of one of the willows. Then she had\ndone it! And what could he do? If he had any idea of her path, he could\nfollow her while Sam aroused Rupert and the house.\n\n\"If I only knew where--\" he mused aloud.\n\n\"She a-goin' to see dat swamper Jeems,\" Sam continued. \"Heh, heh,\" a\nsudden cackle of laughter rippled across his lips. \"Dat ole swamper\nthink he so sma't. Think no one fin' he house--\"\n\n\"Sam!\" Val rounded upon him. \"Do you know where Jeems lives?\"\n\n\"Yessuh.\" He twisted the one shoulder-strap of his overalls and Val\nguessed that his knowledge was something he was either ashamed of or\nafraid to tell.\n\n\"Can you take me there?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Ah ain' a-goin' in dere, Ah ain'!\"\n\n\"But, Sam, you've got to! Miss 'Chanda is in there. She may be lost.\nWe've got to find her!\" Val insisted.\n\nSam's thin shoulders shook and he slid backward as if to avoid the white\nboy's reach. \"Ah ain' a-goin' in dere,\" he repeated stubbornly. \"Effen\nyo'all wants to go in dere--Looky, Mistuh Val, Ah tells yo'all de way\nan' yo'all goes.\" He brightened at this solution. \"Yo'all kin take\npappy's othah boat; it am downstream dere, behin' dem willows. Den\nyo'all goes down to de secon' big pile o' willows. Behin' dem is a li'l\nbitty bayo' goin' back. Yo'all goes up dat 'til yo'all comes to a fur\nrack. Den dat Jeems got de way marked on de trees.\"\n\nWith that he turned and ran as if all the terrors of the night were on\nhis trail. There was nothing for Val to do but to follow his directions.\nAnd the longer he lingered before setting out the bigger lead Ricky was\ngetting.\n\nHe found the canoe behind the willows as Sam had said. Awkwardly he\npushed off, hoping that Lucy would pry the whole story out of her son\nand put Rupert on their track as soon as possible.\n\nThe second clump of willows was something of a landmark, a huge matted\nmass of sucker and branch, the lower tips of the long, frond-like twigs\nsweeping the murky water. A snake swimming with its head just above the\nsurface wriggled to the bank as Val cut into the small hidden stream Sam\nhad told him of.\n\nVines and water plants had almost choked this, but there was a passage\nthrough the center. And one tough spike of vegetation which snapped back\ninto his face bore a deep cut from which the sap was still oozing. The\nsmall stinging flies and mosquitoes followed and hung over him like a\nfog of discomfort. His skin was swollen and rough, irritated and\nitching. And in this green-covered way the heat seemed almost solid.\nDrops of moisture dripped from forehead and chin, and his hair was\nplastered tight to his skull.\n\nFrogs leaped from the bank into the water at the sound of his coming. In\nthe shallows near the bank, crawfish scuttled under water-logged leaves\nand stones at this disturbance of their world. Twice the bayou widened\nout into a sort of pool where the trees grew out of the muddy water and\nall sorts of lilies and bulb plants blossomed in riotous confusion.\n\nOnce a muskrat waddled into the protection of the bushes. And Val saw\nsomething like a small cat drinking at a pool. But that faint shadow\ndisappeared noiselessly almost before the water trickled from his\nupraised paddle.\n\nClumps of wild rice were the meeting grounds for flocks of screaming\nbirds. A snow-white egret waded solemnly across a mud-rimmed pocket. And\nonce a snake, more dangerous than the swimmer Val had first encountered,\nbetrayed its presence by the flicker of its tongue.\n\nThe smell of the steaming mud, the decaying vegetation, and the nameless\nevils hidden deeper in this water-rotted land was an added torment. The\nboy shook a large red ant from its grip in the flesh of his hand and\nwiped the streaming perspiration from his face.\n\nIt was then that the canoe floated almost of its own volition into a\ndead and distorted strip of country. Black water which gave off an evil\nodor covered almost half an acre of ground. From this arose the twisted,\ngaunt gray skeletons of dead oaks. To complete the drear picture a row\nof rusty-black vultures sat along the broad naked limb of the nearest of\nthese hulks, their red-raw heads upraised as they croaked and sidled up\nand down.\n\n[Illustration: _The canoe floated almost of its own volition into a dead\nand distorted strip of country._]\n\nBut the bayou Val was following merely skirted this region, and in a few\nmoments he was again within the shelter of flower-grown banks. Then he\ncame upon a structure which must have been the fur rack Sam Two had\nalluded to, for here was their other boat moored to a convenient willow.\n\nVal fastened the canoe beside it. The turf seemed springy, though here\nand there it gave way to patches of dark mud. It was on one of these\nthat Ricky had left her mark in the clean-cut outline of the sole of her\nriding-boot.\n\nWith a last desperate slap at a mosquito Val headed inland, following\nwith ease that trail of footprints. Ricky was suffering, too, for her\nrashness he noted with satisfaction when he discovered a long curly hair\nfast in the grip of a thorny branch he scraped under.\n\nBut the path was not a bad one. And the farther he went the more solid\nand the dryer it became. Once he passed through a small clearing,\nman-made, where three or four cotton bushes huddled together forlornly\nin company with a luxuriant melon patch.\n\nAnd the melon patch was separated by only a few feet of underbrush from\nJeems' domain. In the middle of a clearing was a sturdy platform,\nreinforced with upright posts and standing about four feet from the\nsurface of the ground. On this was a small cabin constructed of slabs of\nbark-covered wood. As a dwelling it might be crude, but it had an air of\nscrupulous neatness. A short distance to one side of the platform was a\nwell-built chicken-run, now inhabited by five hens and a ragged-tailed\ncock.\n\nThe door of the cabin was shut and there were no signs of life save the\nchickens. But as Val lowered himself painfully onto the second step of\nthe ladder-like stairs leading up to the cabin, he thought he heard\nsomeone moving around. Glancing up, he saw Ricky staring down at him,\nopen-mouthed.\n\n\"Hello,\" she called, for one of the few times in her life really\nastounded.\n\n\"Hello,\" Val answered shortly and shifted his weight to try to relieve\nthe ache in his knee. \"Nice day, isn't it?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nRALESTONES TO THE RESCUE!\n\n\n\"Val! What are you doing here?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Following you. Good grief, girl,\" he exploded, \"haven't you any better\nsense than to come into the swamp this way?\"\n\nRicky's mouth lost its laughing curve and her eyes seemed to narrow. She\nwas, by all the signs, distinctly annoyed.\n\n\"It's perfectly safe. I knew what I was doing.\"\n\n\"Yes? Well, I will enjoy hearing Rupert's remarks on that subject when\nhe catches up with us,\" snapped her brother.\n\n\"Val!\" She lost something of her defiant attitude. He guessed that for\nall her boasted independence his sister was slightly afraid of Mr.\nRupert Ralestone. \"Val, he isn't coming, too, is he?\"\n\n\"He is if he got my message.\" Val stretched his leg cautiously. The\ncramp was slowly leaving the muscles and he felt as if he could stand\nthe remaining ache without wincing. \"I sent Sam Two back to tell Rupert\nwhere his family had eloped to. Frankly, Ricky, this wasn't such a smart\ntrick. You know what Charity said about the swamps. Even the little I've\nseen of them has given me ideas.\"\n\n\"But there was nothing to it at all,\" she protested. \"Jeems told me just\nhow to get here and I only followed directions.\"\n\nVal chose to ignore this, being hot, tired, and in no mood for one of\nthose long arguments such as Ricky enjoyed. \"By the way, where is\nJeems?\" He looked about him as if he expected the swamper to materialize\nout of thin air.\n\nRicky sat down on the edge of the platform and dangled her booted feet.\n\"Don't know. But he'll be here sooner or later. And I don't feel like\ngoing back through the swamp just yet. The flies are awful. And did you\nsee those dreadful vultures on that dead tree? What a place! But the\nflowers are wonderful and I saw a real live alligator, even if it was a\nsmall one.\" She rubbed her scarf across her forehead. \"Whew! It seems\nhotter here than it does at home.\"\n\n\"This outing was all your idea,\" Val reminded her. \"And we'd better be\ngetting back before Rupert calls out the Marines or the State Troopers\nor something to track us down.\"\n\nRicky pouted. \"Not going until I'm ready. And you can't drag me if I dig\nmy heels in.\"\n\n\"I have no desire to be embroiled in such an undignified struggle as you\nsuggest,\" he told her loftily. \"But neither do I yearn to spend the day\nhere. I'm hungry. I wonder if our absent host possesses a larder?\"\n\n\"If he does, you can't raid it,\" Ricky answered. \"The door's locked, and\nthat lock,\" she pointed to the bright disk of brass on the solid cabin\ndoor, \"is a good one. I've already tried a hairpin on it,\" she added\nshamelessly.\n\nThey sat awhile in silence. A wandering breeze had found its way into\nthe clearing, and with it came the fragrance of flowers blossoming under\nthe sun. The chicken family were pursuing a worm with more energy than\nVal decided he would have cared to expend in that heat, and a heavily\nladen bee rested on the lip of a sunflower to brush its legs. Val's\neyelids drooped and he found himself thinking dreamily of a hammock\nunder the trees, a pillow, and long hours of lazy dozing. At the same\ntime a corner of his brain was sending forth nagging messages that they\nshould be up and off, back to their own proper world. But he simply did\nnot have the will power to get up and go.\n\n\"Nice place,\" he murmured, looking about with more approbation than he\nwould have granted the clearing some ten minutes earlier.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Ricky. \"It would be nice to live here.\"\n\nVal was beginning to say something about \"no bathtubs\" when a sound\naroused them from their lethargy. Someone was coming down the path.\nRicky's hand fell upon her brother's shoulder.\n\n\"Quick! Up here and behind the house,\" she urged him.\n\nNot knowing just why he obeyed, Val scrambled up on the tiny platform\nand scuttled around behind the cabin. Why they should hide thus from\nJeems who had given Ricky directions for reaching the place and had\nasked her to come, was more than he could understand. But he had a\nfaint, uneasy feeling of mistrust, as if they had been caught off guard\nat a critical moment.\n\n\"This the place, Red?\" The clipped words sounded clear above the murmurs\nof life from swamp and woods.\n\n\"Yeah. Bum-lookin' joint, ain't it? These guys ain't got no brains; they\nlike to live like this.\" The contempt of the second speaker was only\nsurpassed by the stridency of his voice.\n\n\"What about this boy?\" asked the first.\n\n\"Dumb kid. Don't know yet who his friends is.\" There was a satisfied\ngrunt as the speaker sat down on the step Val had so lately vacated.\nRicky pressed closer to her brother.\n\n\"What about the cabin?\"\n\n\"He ain't here. And it's locked, see? Yuh'd think he kept the crown\njewels there.\" The tickling scent of a cigarette drifted back to the two\nin hiding. \"Beats me how he slipped away this morning without Pitts\ncatching on. For two cents I'd spring that lock of his--\"\n\n\"Isn't worth the trouble,\" replied the other decisively. \"These trappers\nhave no money except at the end of the fur season, and then most of them\nare in debt to the storekeepers.\"\n\n\"Then why--\"\n\n\"I sometimes wonder,\" the voice was coldly cutting, \"why I continue to\nemploy you, Red. What profit would I find in a cabin like this? I want\nwhat he knows, not what he has.\"\n\nHaving thus reduced his henchman to silence, the speaker went on\nsmoothly, as if he were thinking aloud. \"With Simpson doing so well in\ntown, we're close to the finish. This swamper must tell us--\" His voice\ntrailed away. Except for the creaking of wood when the sitter shifted\nhis position, there was no other sound.\n\nThen Red must have grown restless, for someone stamped up to the\nplatform and rattled the chain on the cabin door aggressively. Val\nflattened back against the wall. What if the fellow took it into his\nhead to walk around?\n\n\"Gonna wait here all day?\" demanded Red.\n\n\"As it is necessary for me to have a word with him, we will. This waste\nof time is the product of Pitts' stupidity. I shall remember that. It is\nentirely needless to use force except as a last resource. Now that this\nswamper's suspicions are aroused, we may have trouble.\"\n\n\"Yeah? Well, we can handle that. But how do yuh know that this guy has\nthe stuff?\"\n\n\"I can at least believe the evidence of my own eyes,\" the other replied\nwith bored contempt. \"I came down river alone the night of the storm and\nsaw him on the levee. He has a way of getting into the house all right.\nI saw him in there. And he doesn't go through any of the doors, either.\nI must know how he does it.\"\n\n\"All right, Boss. And what if you do get in? What are we supposed to be\nlookin' for?\"\n\n\"What those bright boys up there found a few days ago. That clerk told\nus that they'd discovered whatever the girl was talking about in the\noffice that day. And we've got to get that before Simpson comes into\ncourt with his suit. I'm not going to lose fifty grand.\" The last\nsentence ended abruptly as if the speaker had snapped his teeth shut\nupon a word like a dog upon its quarry.\n\n\"What does this guy Jeems go to the house for?\" asked Red.\n\n\"Who knows? He seems to be hunting something too. But that's not our\nworry. If it's necessary, we can play ghost also. I've got to get into\nthat house. If I can do it the way this Jeems does, without having to\nbreak in--so much the better. We don't want the police ambling around\nhere just now.\"\n\nVal stiffened. It didn't require a Sherlock Holmes to get the kernel of\ntruth out of the conversation he had overheard. \"Night of the storm,\"\n\"play ghost,\" were enough. So Jeems had been the ghost. And the swamper\nknew a secret way into the house!\n\n\"Wait,\" Ricky's lips formed the words by his ear as Val stirred\nrestlessly. \"Someone else is coming.\"\n\n\"I don't like the set-up in town,\" Red was saying peevishly. \"That\nsmooth mouthpiece is asking too darn many questions. He's always asking\nSimpson about things in the past. If you hadn't got Sim that family\nhistory to study, he'd been behind bars a dozen times by now.\"\n\n\"And he had better study it,\" commented the other dryly, \"because he is\ngoing to be word perfect before the case comes to court, if it ever\ndoes. There are not going to be any slip-ups in this deal.\"\n\n\"'Nother thing I don't like,\" broke in the other, \"is this Waverly guy.\nI don't like his face.\"\n\n\"No? Well, doubtless he would change it if you asked him to. And I do\nnot think it is wise of you to be too critical of plans which were made\nby deeper thinkers than yourself. Sometimes, Red, you weary me.\"\n\nThere was no reply to that harsh judgment. And now Val could hear what\nRicky had heard earlier--a faint swish as of a paddle through water.\nAgain Ricky's lips shaped words he could barely hear.\n\n\"Spur of bayou runs along here in back. Someone coming up from there.\"\n\n\"Jeems?\"\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\n\"We'd better--\" Val motioned toward the front of the cabin. Ricky shook\nher head. Jeems was to be allowed to meet the intruders unwarned.\n\n\"This swamper may be tough,\" ventured Red.\n\n\"We've met hard cases before,\" answered the other significantly.\n\nRed moved again, as if flexing his muscles.\n\n\"One boy, and a small one at that, shouldn't force you to undergo all\nthat preparation,\" goaded the Boss.\n\nRicky must get away at once, her brother decided. Stubbornness or no\nstubbornness, she must go this time. Why he didn't think of going\nhimself Val never afterwards knew. Perhaps he possessed a spark of the\nfamily love of danger, after all, but mostly he clung to his perch\nbecause of that last threat. Whoever Jeems was or whatever he had done,\nhe was one and alone. And he might relish another player on his side.\nBut Ricky must go.\n\nHe said as much in a fierce whisper, only to have her grin recklessly\nback at him. In pantomime she gestured that he might try to make her.\nVal decided that he should have known the result of his efforts. Ricky\nwas a Ralestone, too. And short of throwing her off the platform and so\nunmasking themselves completely, he could not move her against her will.\n\n\"No,\" she whispered. \"They're planning trouble for Jeems. He'll probably\nneed us.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Val cautioned her, \"if it gets too rough, you've got to promise\nto cut downstream for help. We'll be able to use it.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"It's a promise. But we've got to stand by Jeems if he needs\nus.\"\n\n\"If he does--\" Val was still suspicious. \"He may fall in with their\nsuggestions.\"\n\nRicky shook her head. \"He isn't that kind. I don't care if he _has_ been\nplaying ghost.\"\n\nSomeone was walking along the path among the bushes bordering the back\nof the clearing. Although they could hear no sound, they could mark the\npassing of a body by the swish of the foliage. Val lay, face down, on\nthe platform and reached for a stick of wood lying on the ground below.\nSomehow he did not like to think of being caught empty-handed when the\nexcitement began.\n\n\"Hello.\" It was Red, suddenly genial. The Ralestones could almost feel\nthe radiance of the smile which must have split his face.\n\n\"Whatta yo' doin' heah?\" That was Jeems, and his demand was sharply\nhostile.\n\n\"Now, bub, don't get us wrong.\" That was Red, still genial. \"I know my\npal sorta flew off his base this mornin'. But it was all in fun, see? So\nwe kinda wanted yuh to stick around till he came and not do the run-out\non us. And now the Boss has come down here so we can talk business all\nfriendly like.\"\n\n\"Shut up, Red!\" Having so bottled his companion's flow of words, the\nother spoke directly to Jeems. \"My men made a mistake. All right. That's\nover and done with; they'll get theirs. Now let's get down to business.\nWhat do you know about that big plantation up river, the one called\n'Pirate's Haven'?\"\n\n\"Nothin'.\" Jeems' answer was clear. The hostility was gone from his\nvoice; nothing remained but an even tonelessness.\n\n\"Come now, I know you have reason to be hot. But this is business. I'll\nmake it worth your while--\"\n\n\"Nothin',\" answered Jeems as concisely as before.\n\n\"You can't expect us to believe that. I followed you one night.\"\n\n\"Yo' did?\" The challenge was unmistakable.\n\n\"I did. So you see I know something of you. Something which even the\npresent owner does not. Say the ghost in the hall, for example.\"\n\nThere was the sound of a deeply drawn breath.\n\n\"So you see it is to your advantage to listen to us,\" continued the Boss\nsmoothly.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\nVal knew disappointment at that question. Would Jeems surrender as\neasily as that?\n\n\"Just an explanation of how you get into the house unseen.\"\n\n\"Yo'll nevah know!\" The swamper's reply came swift and clear.\n\n\"No? Well, I'd think twice before I held to that answer if I were you,\"\npurred the other softly. \"A word to the Ralestones about those nightly\nwalks of yours--\"\n\n\"Won't give yo' what yo' want,\" replied Jeems shrewdly.\n\n\"I see. Perhaps I have been using the wrong approach,\" observed the Boss\ncomposedly. \"You work for a living, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you know the value of money. What is your price? Come on, we won't\nhaggle.\"\n\nThe Boss' impatience colored his tone. \"How much do you want for this\ninformation?\"\n\n\"Nothin'!\"\n\n\"Nothing?\"\n\n\"Ah ain't said nothin' an' Ah ain't a-goin' to say nothin'. An' yo'\nbettah be a-gittin' offen this heah land of mine afo'--\"\n\n\"Before what, swamper?\" Red was taking a hand in the game.\n\n\"Yo' can't fright'n me with that gun,\" came calmly enough from Jeems.\n\"Yo' ain't a-goin' to risk shootin'--\"\n\n\"There ain't no witnesses here, kid. And there ain't no law back in\nthese swamps. Yuh're gonna tell the Boss what he wants to know an'\nyuh're gonna spill it quick, see? I know some ways of making guys\nsqueal--\"\n\nAt that suggestion Val's fingers tightened on his club and Ricky choked\nback a cry as her brother crept toward the corner of the cabin. Their\nmelodrama was fast taking on the color of tragedy.\n\n\"So yuh better speak up.\" Red was still encouraging Jeems.\n\nThere was no immediate answer from the swamper, but Ricky touched Val's\narm and nodded toward the bushes. She had decided that it was time for\nher to leave. He agreed eagerly. She dropped lightly to the ground and\nhe watched her crawl away unnoticed by those in front who were so intent\nupon the baiting of their quarry.\n\n\"Three minutes, swamper!\"\n\nRicky was gone, free from whatever might develop. Val edged forward and\nfor the first time peered around the corner of the cabin. The two\nassailants were still only voices, but he could see Jeems. The swamper's\nface was bruised and there was a smear of dried blood across one cheek\nas if he had already been roughly handled. But he stood at ease, facing\nthe cabin. His hands were hanging loosely at his sides and he was\nseemingly unconcerned by what confronted him. Suddenly his eyes\nflickered to the bushes at one side. Had Ricky betrayed herself, Val\nwondered breathlessly.\n\nClear now of the cabin, Val wriggled his way around the platform. In a\nminute he would be able to see the Boss and Red. He gripped the club.\n\nThen Jeems stared straight into his face. But the swamper gave no sign\nof seeing Val. And that, to the boy's mind, was the greatest feat of all\nthat afternoon. For Val knew that if he had been in Jeems' place he\nwould have betrayed them both in his surprise.\n\nThe others were at last visible, their backs to Val. Nervously he sized\nthem up. The Boss was tall and thin, but his movements suggested\npossession of wiry strength. Red, his brick-colored hair making him easy\nto identify, was shorter and thick across the shoulders, but his\nwaistline was also thick and the boy thought that his wind was bad. Of\nthe two, the Boss was the more dangerous. Red might lose his head in a\nsudden attack, but not the Boss. Val decided to tackle the latter.\n\nSlowly he got from his knees to his feet. After the first quick glance,\nJeems hadn't looked at him, but Val knew that the swamper was ready and\nwaiting to take advantage of any diversion he might make.\n\n\"Three minutes are up, swamper. So yuh've decided to be tough, eh?\"\n\n\"Whatta yo' wanna know?\" Jeems' question was silly but it held their\nattention.\n\n\"We have told you several times,\" answered the Boss, his temper\nbeginning to fray visibly. \"What is the trick of getting into that\nhouse?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Jeems raised his hand to rub his ear, \"yo' turn to the left--\"\n\nSo he agreed with the listener. Val was to take the Boss on his left. He\ngathered his feet under him for the leap which he hoped would land him\nfull upon the invader.\n\n\"Yes?\" prompted the man impatiently as Jeems hesitated. At that moment\nVal sprang.\n\nBut his game leg betrayed him again. Instead of landing cleanly upon the\nother, he came down draggingly across the Boss' shoulders. The gun\nroared and then the attacked man lashed back a vicious blow which split\nthe skin over Val's cheek-bone.\n\nFor the next three minutes Val was more than occupied. His opponent was\na dirty fighter, and when he had recovered from his surprise he was more\nthan the boy could handle. Val's club was twisted out of his hands, and\nhe found himself fighting wildly to keep the man's clawing fingers from\nhis eyes. They were both rolling on the ground, flailing out at each\nother. Twice Val tasted his own blood when one of the enemy's vicious\njabs glanced along his face. Either blow would have finished Val had it\nlanded clean.\n\nThen in a sudden turn the Boss caught him in a deadly body-lock which\nleft him half-stunned and panting, at his mercy. And there was no mercy\nin the man. When Val looked up into that flushed, snarling face, he knew\nthat he was as hopeless as a trapped animal. The man could--and\nwould--finish him at his leisure.\n\n\"This way, Rupert! Sam!\" the cry reached even Val's dulled ears.\n\nThe man above him stirred. The boy saw the blood-lust fade from his eyes\nand apprehension take its place. He got to his feet, launching a last\nbruising kick at Val's ribs before he limped across the clearing. On his\nway he hauled Red to his feet. They were going, not toward the path from\nthe bayou, but around the house on the trail that Jeems had followed.\nVal struggled up and looked around. The turf was torn and gouged. In the\ndust lay his club and Red's revolver.\n\nAnd by the steps lay something else, a slight brown figure. Painfully\nthe boy got to his feet and lurched across to Jeems.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE RALESTONES BRING HOME A RELUCTANT GUEST\n\n\nThe swamper was lying on his back, his eyes closed. From a great purple\nwelt across his forehead the blood oozed sluggishly. When Val touched\nhim he moaned faintly.\n\n\"Val! Are you hurt? What's the matter?\" Ricky was upon them like a\nwhirlwind out of the bush.\n\n\"Jeems stopped a nasty one,\" her brother panted.\n\n\"Is he--\" She dropped down in the dust beside them.\n\n\"He's knocked out, and he'll have a bad headache for some time, but I\ndon't think it's any worse than that.\"\n\nRicky had pulled out a microscopic bit of handkerchief and was dabbing\nat the blood in an amateurish way. Jeems moaned and turned his head as\nif to get away from her ministrations.\n\n\"Where's Rupert--and Sam?\" Val looked toward the path. \"They were with\nyou, weren't they?\"\n\nRicky shook her head. \"No. That was just what you call creating a\ndiversion. For all I know, they're busy at home.\"\n\nHer brother straightened. \"Then we've got to get out of here--fast.\nThose two left because they were rattled, but when they have had a\nchance to cool off they'll be back.\"\n\n\"What about Jeems?\"\n\n\"Take him with us, of course. We won't be able to manage the canoe. But\nyou brought the outboard, so we'll go in that and tow the canoe. We\nought to have something to cover his head.\" Val regarded the bleeding\nwound doubtfully.\n\nWithout answering, Ricky leaned forward and began systematically going\nthrough Jeems' pockets. In the second she found a key. Val took it from\nher and hobbled up the cabin steps. For a wonder, he thought thankfully,\nthe key was the right one. The lock clicked and he went in.\n\nLike the clearing, the interior of the one-room shack was neat, a place\nfor everything and everything in its place. Under the window in the far\nwall was a small chest of some dark polished wood. Save for its size, it\nwas not unlike the chests the Ralestones had found in their store-room.\nOpposite it was a wooden cot, the covers smoothly spread. A stool, a\nblackened cook stove, and a solid table with an oil lamp were the extent\nof the furnishings. Lines of traps hung on the walls, along with the\nwooden boards for the stretching of drying skins, and there was a\nhalf-finished grass basket lying on top of the chest.\n\nVal hefted a stoneware jug. They had no time to hunt for a spring. And\nif this contained water, they would need it. At the resulting gurgle\nfrom within, he set it by the door and returned to rob the cot of pillow\nand the single coarse but clean sheet.\n\nRicky tore the sheet and made a creditable job of washing and bandaging\nthe ugly bruise. Jeems drank greedily when they offered him water but he\ndid not seem to recognize them. In answer to Ricky's question of how he\nfelt, he muttered something in the swamp French of the Cajuns. But he\nwas uneasy until Val locked the cabin door and put the key in his hand.\n\n\"How are we going to get him to the boat?\" asked Ricky suddenly.\n\n\"Carry him.\"\n\n\"But, Val--\" for the first time she looked at her brother as if she\nreally saw him--\"Val, you're hurt!\"\n\n\"Just a little stiff,\" he hastened to assure her. \"Our late visitors\nplay rather rough. We'll manage all right. I'll take his shoulders and\nyou his feet.\"\n\nThey wavered drunkenly along the path. Twice Val stumbled and regained\nhis balance just in time. Ricky had laid the pillow across their\nburden's feet, declaring that she would need it when they got to the\nboat. Val passed the point of aching misery--when he thought that he\ncould not shuffle forward another step--and now he came into what he had\nheard called \"second wind.\" By fixing his eyes on a tree or a bush a\nstep or two ahead and concentrating only upon passing that one, and then\nthat, and that, he got through without disgracing himself.\n\nAt the bayou at last, they wriggled Jeems awkwardly into the boat. Val\nhad no doubt that a woodsman might have done the whole job better in\nmuch less time and without a tenth of the effort they had expended. But\nall he ever wondered afterward was how they ever did it at all.\n\n[Illustration: _At the bayou at last, they wriggled Jeems awkwardly into\nthe boat._]\n\nIt was when Ricky had made their passenger as comfortable as she could\nin the bottom of the boat, steadying his head across her knees, that her\nbrother partially relaxed.\n\n\"Val, you run the engine,\" she said without looking up.\n\nHe dragged himself toward the stern of the boat, remembering too late,\nwhen he had cast off, that he had not taken the canoe in tow. The engine\ncoughed, sputtered, and then settled down to a steady _putt-putt_. They\nwere off.\n\n\"Val, do you--do you think he is badly hurt?\"\n\nHe dared not look down; it required all his powers of concentration on\nwhat lay before them to keep his hand steady.\n\n\"No. We'll get a doctor when we get back. He'll come around again in no\ntime--Jeems, I mean.\"\n\nBut would he? Head injuries were sometimes more serious than they\nseemed, Val remembered dismally.\n\nIt was not until they came out into the main bayou that Jeems roused\nagain. He looked up at Ricky in a sort of dull surprise, and then his\ngaze shifted to Val.\n\n\"What--\"\n\n\"We won the war,\" Val tried to grin, an operation which tore his mask of\ndried blood, \"thanks to Ricky. And now we're going home.\"\n\nAt that, Jeems made a violent effort to sit up.\n\n\"_Non_!\" his English deserted him and he broke into impassioned French.\n\n\"Yes,\" Val replied firmly as Ricky pushed the swamper down. \"Of course\nyou're coming with us. You've had a nasty knock on the head that needs\nattention.\"\n\n\"Ah'm not a-goin' to no hospital!\" His eyes burned into Val's.\n\n\"Certainly not!\" cried Ricky. \"You're bound for our guest-room. Now keep\nquiet. We'll be there soon.\"\n\n\"Ah ain't a-goin',\" he declared mutinously.\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" Ricky scolded him; \"we're taking you. Does Val have to\ncome and hold you down?\"\n\n\"Ah can't!\" His eyes flickered from Val's face to hers. There was\nsomething more than independence behind that firm refusal. \"Ah ain't\na-goin' theah.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nHe seemed to shrink from her. \"It ain't fitten,\" he murmured.\n\n\"How perfectly silly,\" laughed Ricky. But Val thought that he\nunderstood.\n\n\"Because of the secret you know?\" he asked quietly.\n\nThe pallor beneath Jeems' heavy tan vanished in a flush of slow-burning\nred. \"Ah reckon so,\" he muttered, but he met Val's eyes squarely.\n\n\"Let's leave all explanations until later,\" Val suggested.\n\n\"Ah played haunt!\" the confession came out of the swamper in a rush.\n\n\"Then you _were_ my faceless ghost?\"\n\nJeems tried to nod and the action printed a frown of pain between his\neyes.\n\n\"Why? Didn't you want us to live there?\" asked Ricky gently.\n\n\"Ah was huntin'--\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\nThe frown became one of puzzlement. \"Ah don't know--\" His voice trailed\noff into a thin whisper as his eyes closed wearily. Val signaled Ricky\nto keep quiet.\n\n\"Ahoy there!\" Along the bank toward them came Rupert and after him Sam.\nBeyond them lay the Ralestone landing. Val headed inshore.\n\n\"Just what does this mean--Val! Has there been an accident?\" The\nirritation in Rupert's voice became hot concern.\n\n\"An intended one,\" his brother replied. \"We've got the real victim here\nwith us.\"\n\nThey tied up to the landing and Sam came down to hand out Jeems who\napparently had lapsed into unconsciousness again.\n\n\"You'd better call a doctor,\" Val told Rupert. \"Jeems has a head wound.\"\n\nBut Rupert had already taken charge of affairs with an efficiency which\nleft Val humbly grateful. The boy didn't even move to leave the boat. It\nwas better just to sit and watch other people scurry about. Sam had\nstarted for the house, carrying Jeems as if the long-legged swamper was\nthe same age and size as his own small son. Ricky dashed on ahead to\nwarn Lucy. Rupert had Sam Two by the collar and was giving him\ninstructions for catching Dr. LeFrode, who was probably making his\nmorning rounds and might be found at the sugar-mill where one of the\nfeeders had injured his hand. Sam Two's sister had seen the doctor on\nhis way there a scant ten minutes earlier.\n\nVal watched all this activity dreamily. Everything would be all right\nnow that Rupert was in charge. He could relax--\n\n\"Now,\" his brother turned upon Val, \"just what did--What's the matter\nwith you?\"\n\n\"Tired, I guess,\" Val said ruefully. But Rupert was already in the boat,\ngetting the younger boy to his unsteady feet.\n\n\"Can you make it to the house?\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"Sure. Just give me an arm till I get on the landing.\"\n\nBut when Val had crawled up on the levee he did not feel at all like\nwalking to the house. Then Rupert's arm was about his thin shoulders and\nhe thought that he could make it if he really tried.\n\nThe garden path seemed miles long, and it was not until Val had the soft\ncushions of the hall couch under him that he felt able to tell his\nstory. But at that moment the short, stout doctor came through the door\nin a rush. Sam Two had led him to believe that half the household had\nbeen murdered. At first Dr. LeFrode started toward Val, until in alarm\nthe boy swung his feet to the floor and sat up, waving the man to the\nstairway where Ricky hovered to act as guide.\n\nThen Val was alone, even Sam Two having edged upstairs to share in the\nexcitement. The boy sank back on his pillows and wondered where their\nlate assailants were now, and why they had been so determined to learn\nJeems' secret. As Ricky had said once before, the Ralestones seemed to\nhave been handed a gigantic tangle without ends, only middle sections,\nand had been told to unravel it.\n\nBoot heels clicked on the stone flooring. Val turned his head cautiously\nand tried not to wince. Rupert was coming in with a bowl of water, from\nwhich steam still arose. Across his arm lay a towel and in his other\nhand was their small first-aid kit.\n\n\"Suppose we do a little patching,\" he suggested. \"Your face at present\nis not all it might be. What did you and your swamp friend do--run into\na mowing machine?\" He swabbed delicately at the cut the Boss had opened\nacross Val's cheek-bone, and at another by his mouth.\n\n\"I thought it might be that for a moment--a mowing machine, I mean. No,\nwe just met a couple of gentlemen--enterprising fellows who wanted to\nsee more of this commodious mansion of ours--\" Val's words faded into a\nsharp hiss as Rupert applied iodine with a liberal hand. \"They seemed to\nthink that Jeems knew a lot about Pirate's Haven and they were going to\npersuade him to tell all. Only it didn't turn out the way they had\nplanned.\"\n\n\"Due to you?\" Rupert eyed his brother intently. The boy's face was\nswollen almost out of recognition and he didn't like this sudden\ntalkativeness.\n\n\"Due partly to me, but mostly to Ricky. She--ah--created the necessary\ndiversion. I had sort of lost interest at the time. I know so little\nabout gouging and biting in clinches.\"\n\n\"Dirty fighters?\"\n\n\"Well, soiled anyway. But if the Boss isn't nursing a cracked wrist, it\nisn't my fault. I don't know what Jeems did to Red, but he, too,\ndeparted in a damaged condition. Do you have to do that?\" Val demanded\ntestily, squirming as Rupert ran his hands lightly over the boy's\nshoulders and down his ribs, touching every bruise to tingling life.\n\n\"Just seeing the extent of the damage,\" he explained.\n\n\"You don't have to see, I can feel!\" Val snapped pettishly.\n\nRupert got to his feet. \"Come on.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Oh, a hot bath and then bed. You'll be taking an interest in life again\nabout this time tomorrow. I think LeFrode had better see you too.\"\n\n\"No,\" Val objected. \"I'm not a child.\"\n\nRupert grinned. \"If you'd rather I carried you--\"\n\nThere was no opposing Rupert when he was in that mood, as his brother\nwell knew. Val got up slowly.\n\nThe program that Rupert had outlined was faithfully carried out. Half an\nhour later Val found himself between sheets, blinking at the ceiling\ndrowsily. When two cracks overhead wavered together of their own accord,\nhis eyes closed.\n\n\"--still sleeping?\" whispered someone at his side much later.\n\n\"Yes, best thing for him.\"\n\n\"Was he badly hurt?\"\n\n\"No, just banged around more than was good for him.\"\n\nVal opened his eyes. It must have been close to dusk, for the sunlight\nwas red across the bedclothes. Rupert stood by the window and Ricky was\nin the doorway, a tray of covered dishes in her hands.\n\n\"Hello!\" Val sat up, grimacing at the twinge of pain across his back.\n\"What day is this?\"\n\nRupert laughed. \"Still Tuesday.\"\n\n\"How's Jeems?\"\n\n\"Doing very well. I've had to have Rupert in to frighten him into\nstaying in bed,\" Ricky said. \"The doctor thinks he ought to be there a\ncouple of days at least. But Jeems doesn't agree with him. Between\nkeeping Jeems in bed and keeping Rupert out of the swamp I've had a full\nday.\"\n\nRupert sat down on the foot of the bed. \"You'd know this Boss and Red\nagain, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Then you'll probably have a chance to identify them.\" There was a grim\nlook about Rupert's jaw. \"Ricky's told me all that you overheard. I\ndon't know what it means but I've heard enough for me to get in touch\nwith LeFleur. He'll be out tomorrow morning. And once we get something\nto work on--\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to feel sorry for our swamp visitors,\" Val interrupted.\n\n\"They'll be sorry,\" hinted Rupert darkly. \"How about you, Val, beginning\nto feel hungry?\"\n\n\"Now that you mention it, I _am_ discovering a rather hollow ache in my\ncenter section. Supper ready?\"\n\n\"Half an hour. I'll bring you up a tray--\" began Ricky.\n\nBut Val had thrown back the sheet and was sitting on the side of the\nbed. \"Oh, no, you don't! I'm not an invalid yet.\"\n\nRicky glanced at Rupert and then left. Val reached for his shirt\ndefiantly. But his brother raised no objection. The painful stiffness\nVal had felt at first wore off and he was able to move without feeling\nas if each muscle were tied in cramping knots.\n\n\"May I pay Jeems a visit?\" he asked as they went out into the hall.\nRupert nodded toward a door across the corridor.\n\n\"In there. He's a stubborn piece of goods. Reminds me of you at times.\nIf he'd ever get rid of that scowl of his, he'd be even more like you.\nHe warms to Ricky, but you'd think I was a Chinese torturer the way he\nacts when I go in.\" There was a shade of irritation in Rupert's voice.\n\n\"Maybe he's afraid of you.\"\n\n\"But what for?\" Rupert stared at the boy in open surprise.\n\n\"Well, you do have rather a commanding air at times,\" Val countered. If\nRicky had told Rupert nothing of Jeems' confession, he wasn't going to.\n\n\"So that's what you really think of me!\" observed Rupert. \"Go reason\nwith that wildcat of yours if you want to. I'm beginning to believe that\nyou are two of a kind.\" He turned abruptly down the hall.\n\nVal opened the door of the bedroom. The sunlight was fading fast and\nalready the corners of the large room were filled with the gray of dusk.\nBut light from the windows swept full across the bed and its occupant.\nVal hobbled stiffly toward it.\n\n\"Hello.\" The brown face on the pillow did not change expression as Val\ngreeted the swamper. \"How do you feel now?\"\n\n\"Bettah,\" Jeems answered shortly. \"Ah'm good but they won't le' me up.\"\n\n\"The Doc says you're in for a couple of days,\" Val told him.\n\nSomehow Jeems looked smaller, shrunken, as he lay in that oversized bed.\nAnd he had lost that air of indolent arrogance which had made him seem\nso independent in their swamp and garden meetings. It was as if Val were\nlooking down upon a younger and less confident edition of the swamper he\nhad known.\n\n\"What does he think?\" There was urgency in that question.\n\n\"Who's he?\"\n\n\"Yo' brothah.\"\n\n\"Rupert? Why, he's glad to have you here,\" Val answered.\n\n\"Does he know 'bout--\"\n\nVal shook his head.\n\n\"Tell him!\" ordered the swamper. \"Ah ain't a-goin' to stay undah his\nruff lessen he knows. 'Tain't fitten.\"\n\nAt this clean-cut statement of the laws of hospitality, Val nodded. \"All\nright. I'll tell him. But what were you after here, Jeems? I'll have to\ntell him that, too, you know. Was it the Civil War treasure?\"\n\nJeems turned his head slowly. \"No.\" Again the puzzled frown twisted his\nstraight, finely marked brows. \"What do Ah want wi' treasure? Ah don't\nknow what Ah was lookin' fo'. Mah grandpappy--\"\n\n\"Val, supper's ready,\" came Rupert's voice from the hall.\n\nVal half turned to go. \"I've got to go now. But I'll be back later,\" he\npromised.\n\n\"Yo'll tell him?\" Jeems stabbed a finger at the door.\n\n\"Yes; after supper. I promise.\"\n\nWith a little sigh Jeems relaxed and burrowed down into the softness of\nthe pillow. \"Ah'll be awaitin',\" he said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nON SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS--\n\n\nIt had been on of those dull, weepy days when a sullen drizzle clouded\nsky and earth. In consequence, the walls and floors of Pirate's Haven\nseemed to exude chill. Rupert built a fire in the hall fireplace, but\nnone of the family could say that it was a successful one. It made a\nnice show of leaping flame accompanied by fancy lighting effects but\ngave forth absolutely no heat.\n\n\"Val?\"\n\nThe boy started guiltily and thrust his note-book under the couch\ncushion as Charity came in. Tiny drops of rain were strung along the\nhairs which had blown free of her rain-cape hood like steel beads along\na golden wire.\n\n\"Yes? Don't come here expecting to get warm,\" he warned her bitterly.\n\"We are very willing but the fire is weak. Looks pretty, doesn't it?\" He\nkicked at a charred end on the hearth. \"Well, that's all it's good for!\"\n\n\"Val, what sort of a mess have you and Jeems jumped into?\" she asked as\nshe handed him her dripping cape.\n\n\"Oh, just a general sort of mess,\" he answered lightly. \"Jeems had\ncallers who forgot their manners. So Ricky and I breezed in and brought\nthe party to a sudden end--\"\n\n\"As I can see by your black eye,\" she commented. \"But what has Jeems\nbeen up to?\"\n\nVal was suddenly very busy holding her cape before that mockery of a\nblaze.\n\n\"Why don't you ask him that?\"\n\n\"Because I'm asking you. Rupert came over last night and sat on my\ngallery making very roundabout inquiries concerning Jeems. I pried out\nof him the details of your swamp battle. But I want to know now just\nwhat Jeems has been doing. Your brother is so vague--\"\n\n\"Rupert has the gift of being exasperatingly uncommunicative,\" his\nbrother told her. \"The story, so far as I know, is short and simple.\nJeems knows a secret way into this house. In addition, his grandfather\ntold him that the fortune of the house of Jeems is concealed\nhere--having been very hazy in his description of the nature of said\nfortune. Consequently, grandson has been playing haunt up and down our\nhalls trying to find it.\n\n\"His story is as full of holes as a sieve but somehow one can't help\nbelieving it. He has explained that he has the secret of the outside\nentrance only, and not the one opening from the inside. In the meantime\nhe is in bed--guarded from intrusion by Ricky and Lucy with the same\ncare as if he were the crown jewels. So matters rest at present.\"\n\n\"Neatly put.\" She dropped down on the couch. \"By the way, do you realize\nthat you have ruined your face for my uses?\"\n\nVal fingered the crisscrossing tape on his cheek. \"This is only\ntemporary.\"\n\n\"I certainly hope so. That must have been some battle.\"\n\n\"One of our better efforts.\" He coughed in mock modesty. \"Ricky saved\nthe day with alarms and excursions without. Rupert probably told you\nthat.\"\n\n\"Yes, he can be persuaded to talk at times. Is he always so silent?\"\n\n\"Nowadays, yes,\" he answered slowly. \"But when we were younger--You\nknow,\" Val turned toward her suddenly, his brown face serious to a\ndegree, \"it isn't fair to separate the members of a family. To put one\nhere and one there and the third somewhere else. I was twelve when\nFather died, and Ricky was eleven. They sent her off to Great-aunt\nRogers because Uncle Fleming, who took me, didn't care for a girl--\"\n\n\"And Rupert?\"\n\n\"Rupert--well, he was grown, he could arrange his own life; so he just\nwent away. We got a letter now and then, or a post-card. There was money\nenough to send us to expensive schools and dress us well. It was two\nyears before I really saw Ricky again. You can't call short visits on\nSunday afternoons seeing anyone.\n\n\"Then Uncle Fleming died and I was simply parked at Great-aunt\nRogers'. She\"--Val was remembering things, a bitter look about\nhis mouth--\"didn't care for boys. In September I was sent to a military\nacademy. I needed discipline, it seemed. And Ricky was sent to Miss\nSomebody's-on-the-Hudson. Rupert was in China then. I got a letter from\nhim that fall. He was about to join some expedition heading into the\nGobi.\n\n\"Ricky came down to the Christmas hop at the academy, then Aunt Rogers\ntook her abroad. She went to school in Switzerland a year. I passed from\nschool to summer camp and then back to school. Ricky sent me some\ncarvings for Christmas--they arrived three days late.\"\n\nHe stared up at the stone mantel. \"Kids feel things a lot more than\nthey're given credit for. Ricky sent me a letter with some tear stains\nbetween the lines when Aunt Rogers decided to stay another year. And\nthat was the year I earned the reputation of being a 'hard case.'\n\n\"Then Ricky cabled me that she was coming home. I walked out of school\nthe same morning. I didn't even tell anyone where I was going. Because I\nhad money enough, I thought I would fly. And that, dear lady, is the end\nof this very sad tale.\" He grinned one-sidedly down at her.\n\n\"It was then that--that--\"\n\n\"I was smashed up? Yes. And Rupert came home without warning to find\nthings very messy. I was in the hospital when I should have been in some\ncorrective institution, as Aunt Rogers so often told me during those\ndays. Ricky was also in disgrace for speaking her mind, as she does now\nand then. To make it even more interesting, our guardian had been\namusing himself by buying oil stock with our capital. Unfortunately, oil\ndid not exist in the wells we owned. Yes, Rupert had every right to be\nanything but pleased with the affairs of the Ralestones.\n\n\"He swept us off here where we are still under observation, I believe.\"\n\n\"Then you don't like it here?\"\n\n\"Like it? Madam, 'like' is a very pallid word. What if you were offered\neverything you ever wished for, all tied up in pink ribbons and laid on\nyour door-step? What would your reaction be?\"\n\n\"So,\" she was staring into the fire, \"that's the way of it?\"\n\n\"Yes. Or it would be if--\" He stooped to reach for another piece of\nwood. The fire was threatening to die again.\n\n\"What is the flaw in the masterpiece?\" she asked quietly.\n\n\"Rupert. He's changed. In the old days he was one of us; now he's a\nstranger. We're amusing to have around, someone to look after, but I\nhave a feeling that to him we don't really exist. We aren't real--\" Val\nfloundered trying to express that strange, walled-off emotion which so\noften held him in this grown-up brother's presence. \"Things like this\n'Bluebeard's Chamber' of his--that isn't like the Rupert we knew.\"\n\n\"Did you ever think that he might be shy, too?\" she asked. \"He left two\nchildren and came home to find two distrustful adults. Give him his\nchance--\"\n\n\"Charity!\" Ricky ran lightly downstairs. \"Why didn't Val tell me you had\ncome?\"\n\n\"I just dropped in to inquire concerning your patient.\"\n\n\"He's better-tempered than Val,\" declared Ricky shamelessly. \"You'll\nstay to dinner of course. We're having some sort of crab dish that Lucy\nseems to think her best effort. Rupert will be back by then, I'm sure;\nhe's out somewhere with Sam. There's been some trouble about trespassers\non the swamp lands. Goodness, won't this rain ever stop?\"\n\nAs if in answer to her question, there came a great gust of wind and\nrain against the door, a blast which shook the oak, thick and solid as\nit was. And then came the thunder of the knocker which Letty-Lou had\npolished into shining life only the day before.\n\nVal opened the door to find Mr. Creighton and Mr. Holmes huddled on the\nmat. They came in with an eagerness which was only surpassed by Satan,\nwet and displaying cold anger towards his mistress, whom he passed with\na disdainful flirt of his tail as he headed for that deceptive fire.\n\n\"You, again,\" observed Charity resignedly as Sam Two was summoned and\nsent away again draped with wet coats and drenched hats.\n\n\"Man\"--Holmes argued with Satan for the possession of the\nhearth-stone--\"when it rains in this country, it rains. A branch of your\ncreek down there is almost over the road--\"\n\n\"Bayou, not creek,\" corrected Charity acidly. Lately she had shown a\nmarked preference for Holmes' absence rather than his company.\n\n\"I stand corrected,\" he laughed; \"a branch of your bayou.\"\n\n\"If you found it so unpleasant, why did you--\" began Charity, and then\nshe flushed as if she had suddenly realized that that speech was too\nrude even for her recent attitude.\n\n\"Why did we come?\" Holmes' crooked eyebrow slid upward as his face\nregistered mock reproof. \"My, my, what a warm welcome, my dear.\" He\nshook his head and Charity laughed in spite of herself.\n\n\"Don't mind my bearishness,\" she made half apology. \"You know what\npleasant moods I fall into while working. And this rain is depressing.\"\n\n\"But Miss Biglow is right.\" Creighton smiled his rare, shy smile.\nBrusque and impatient as he was when on business bent, he was awkwardly\nuncomfortable in ordinary company. The man, Val sometimes thought\nprivately, lived, ate, slept books. Save when they were the subject of\nconversation, he was as out of his element as a coal-miner at the\nballet. \"We should explain the reason for this--this rather abrupt\ncall.\" He fingered his brief-case, which he still clutched, nervously.\n\n\"Down to business already.\" Holmes seated himself on the arm of Ricky's\nchair. \"Very well, out with it.\"\n\nCreighton smiled again, laid the case across his knees, and looked\nstraight at Ricky. For some reason he talked to her, as if she above all\nothers must be firmly convinced of the importance of his mission.\n\n\"It is a very queer story, Miss Ralestone, a very queer--\"\n\n\"Said the mariner to the wedding guest.\" Holmes snapped his fingers at\nSatan, who contemptuously ignored him. \"Or am I thinking of the Whiting\nwho talked to the Snail?\"\n\n\"Perhaps I had better begin at the beginning,\" continued Creighton,\nfrowning at Holmes who refused to be so suppressed.\n\n\"Why be so dramatic about it, old man? It's very simple, Miss Ricky.\nCreighton has lost an author and he wants you to help find him.\"\n\nWhen Ricky's eyes involuntarily swept about the room, Val joined in the\nlaughter. \"No, it isn't as easy as all that, I'm afraid.\" Creighton had\nlost his nervous shyness. \"But what Holmes says is true. I have lost an\nauthor and do hope that you can help me locate the missing gentleman--or\nlady. Two months ago an agent sent a manuscript to our office for\nreading. It wasn't complete, but he thought it was well worth our\nattention. It was.\n\n\"Although there were only five chapters finished, the rest being but\nsynopsis and elaborated scenes, we knew that we had something--something\nbig. We delayed reporting upon it until Mr. Brewster--our senior\npartner--returned from Europe. Mr. Brewster has the final decision on\nall manuscripts; he was as well pleased with this offering as we were.\nFrankly, we saw possibilities of another great success such as those two\nlong historical novels which have been so popular during the past few\nyears.\n\n\"Queerly enough, the author's name was not upon the papers sent us by\nthe agent--that is, his proper name; there was a pen-name. And when we\napplied to Mr. Lever, the agent, we received a most unpleasant shock.\nThe author's real name, which had been given in the covering letter\nmailed with the manuscript to Mr. Lever, had most strangely disappeared,\ndue to some carelessness in his office.\n\n\"Now we have an extremely promising book and no author--\"\n\n\"What I can't understand,\" cut in Holmes, \"is the modesty of the author.\nWhy hasn't he written to Lever?\"\n\n\"That is the most unfortunate part of the whole affair.\" Mr. Creighton\nshook his head. \"Lever recalled that the chap had said in the letter\nthat if Lever found the manuscript unsalable he should destroy it, as\nthe writer was moving about and had no permanent address. The fellow\nadded that if he didn't hear from Lever he would assume that it was not\nacceptable. Lever wrote to the address given in the letter to\nacknowledge receipt, but that was all.\"\n\n\"Mysterious,\" Val commented, interested in spite of himself.\n\n\"Just so. Lever deduced from the tone of the letter that the writer was\nvery uncertain of his own powers and hesitated to submit his manuscript.\nAnd yet, what we have is a very fine piece of work, far beyond the\nability of the average beginner. The author must have written other\nthings.\n\n\"The novel is historical, with a New Orleans setting. Its treatment is\nso detailed that only one who had lived here or had close connections\nwith this country could have produced it. Mr. Brewster, knowing that I\nwas about to travel south, asked me to see if I could discover our\nmissing author through his material. So far I have failed; our man is\nunknown to any of the writers of the city or to any of those interested\nin literary matters.\n\n\"Yet he knows New Orleans and its history as few do today except those\nof old family who have been born and bred here. Dr. Hanly Richardson of\nTulane University has assured me that much of the material used is\nauthentic--historically correct to the last detail. And it was Dr.\nRichardson who suggested that several of the scenes must have actually\noccurred, becoming with the passing of time part of the tradition of\nsome aristocratic family.\n\n\"The period of the story is that time of transition when Louisiana\npassed from Spain to France and then under the control of the United\nStates. It covers the years immediately preceding the Battle of New\nOrleans. Unfortunately, those were years of disturbance and change.\nEvents which might have been the talk of the town, and so have found\ndescription in gossipy memoirs, were swallowed by happenings of national\nimportance. It is, I believe, in intimate family records only that I can\nfind the clue I seek.\"\n\n\"Which scenes\"--Ricky's eyes shone in the firelight--\"are those Dr.\nRichardson believes real?\"\n\n\"Well, he was very certain that the duel of the twin brothers must have\noccurred--Why, Mr. Ralestone,\" he interrupted himself as the stick Val\nwas about to place on the fire fell from his hands and rolled across the\nfloor. \"Mr. Ralestone, what is the matter?\"\n\nAcross his shoulder Ricky signaled her brother. And above her head Val\nsaw Holmes' eyes narrow shrewdly.\n\n\"Nothing. I'm sorry I was so clumsy.\" Val stooped hurriedly to hide his\nconfusion.\n\n\"A duel between twin brothers.\" Ricky twisted one of the buttons which\nmarched down the front of her sport dress. \"That sounds exciting.\"\n\n\"They fought at midnight\"--Creighton was enthralled by the story he was\ntelling--\"and one was left for dead. The scene is handled with restraint\nand yet you'd think that the writer had been an eye-witness. Now if such\na thing ever did happen, there would have been a certain amount of talk\nafterwards--\"\n\nCharity nodded. \"The slaves would have spread the news,\" she agreed,\n\"and the person who found the wounded twin.\"\n\nVal kept his eyes upon the hearth-stone. There was no stain there, but\nhis vivid imagination painted the gray as red as it had been that cold\nnight when the slave woman had come to find her master lying there, his\nbrother's sword across his body. Someone had used the story of the\nmissing Ralestone. But who today knew that story except themselves,\nCharity, LeFleur, and some of the negroes?\n\n\"And you think that some mention of such an event might be found in the\npapers of the family concerned?\" asked Ricky. She was leaning forward in\nher chair, her lips parted eagerly.\n\n\"Or in those of some other family covering the same period,\" Creighton\nadded. \"I realize that this is an impertinence on my part, but I wonder\nif such mention might not be found among the records of your own house.\nFrom what I have seen and heard, your family was very prominent in the\ncity affairs of that time--\"\n\nRicky stood up. \"There is no need to ask, Mr. Creighton. My brother and\nI will be most willing to help you. Unfortunately, Rupert is very much\nimmersed in a business matter just now, but Val and I will go through\nthe papers we have.\"\n\nVal choked down the protest that was on his lips just in time to nod\nagreement. For some reason Ricky wanted to keep the secret. Very well,\nhe would play her game. At least he would until he knew what lay behind\nher desire for silence.\n\n\"That is most kind.\" Creighton was beaming upon both of them. \"I cannot\ntell you how much I appreciate your co\u00f6peration in this matter--\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" answered Ricky with that deceptive softness in her voice\nwhich masked her rising temper. \"We are only too grateful to be allowed\nto share a secret.\"\n\nAnd then her brother guessed that she did not mean Creighton's secret\nbut some other. She crossed the room and rang the bell for Letty-Lou to\nbring coffee. Something triumphant in her step added to Val's suspicion.\nLike the Englishman of Kipling's poem, Ricky was most to be feared when\nshe grew polite. He turned in time to see her wink at Charity.\n\nRupert came in just then, wet and thoroughly out of sorts, full of the\nevidences he had discovered on Ralestone lands bordering the swamp that\nstrangers had been camping there. Their guests all stayed to supper,\nlingering long about the table to discuss Rupert's find, so that Val did\nnot get a chance to be alone with Ricky to demand an explanation. And\nfor some reason she seemed to be adroitly avoiding him. He did have her\nalmost cornered in the upper hall when Letty-Lou came up behind him and\nplucked at his sleeve.\n\n\"Mistuh Val,\" she said, \"dat Jeems boy done wan' to see yo'all.\"\n\n\"Bother Jeems!\" Val exploded, his eyes on Ricky's back. But he stepped\ninto the bedroom where the swamper was still imprisoned by Lucy's\norders.\n\nThe boy was propped up on his pillows, looking out of the window. His\nbody was tense. At the sound of Val's step he turned his bandaged head.\n\n\"Can't yo' git me outa heah?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"The watah's up!\" His eyes were upon the water-filled darkness of the\ngarden.\n\n\"But that's all right,\" the other assured him. \"Sam says that it won't\nreach the top of the levee. At the worst, only the lower part of the\ngarden will be flooded.\"\n\nJeems glanced at Val over his shoulder and then without a word he edged\ntoward the side of the bed and tried to stand. But with a muffled gasp\nhe sank back again, pale and weak. Awkwardly Val forced him back against\nhis pillows.\n\n\"It's all right,\" he assured him again.\n\nBut in answer the swamper shook his head violently, \"It ain't all right\nin the swamp.\"\n\nIn a flash Val caught his meaning. Swampers lived on house-boats for the\nmost part, and the boats will outride all but unusual floods. But Jeems'\ncabin was built on land, land none too stable even in dry weather. The\nswamp boy touched Val's hand.\n\n\"It ain't safe. Two of them piles is rotted. If the watah gits that far,\nthey'll go.\"\n\n\"You mean the piles holding up your cabin platform?\" Val asked.\n\nHe nodded. For a second Val caught a glimpse of forlorn loneliness\nbeneath the sullen mask Jeems habitually wore.\n\n\"But there's nothing you can do now--\"\n\n\"It ain't the cabin. Ah gotta git the chest--\"\n\n\"The one in the cabin?\"\n\nHis black eyes were fixed upon Val's, and then they swerved and rested\nupon the wall behind the young Ralestone.\n\n\"Ah gotta git the chest,\" he repeated simply.\n\nAnd Val knew that he would. He would get out of bed and go into the\nswamp after that treasure of his. Which left only one thing for Val to\ndo.\n\n\"I'll get the chest, Jeems. Let me have your key to the cabin. I'll take\nthe outboard motor and be back before I'm missed.\"\n\n\"Yo' don't know the swamp--\"\n\n\"I know how to find the cabin. Where's the key?\"\n\n\"In theah,\" he pointed to the highboy.\n\nVal's fingers closed about the bit of metal.\n\n\"Mistuh,\" Jeems straightened, \"Ah won't forgit this.\"\n\nVal glanced toward the downpour without.\n\n\"Neither will I, in all probability,\" he said dryly as he went out.\n\nIt had been on just such a night as this that the missing Ralestone had\ngone out into the gloom. But he was coming back again, Val reminded\nhimself hurriedly. Of course he was. With a shake he pulled on his\ntrench-coat and slipped out the front door unseen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nPIRATE WAYS ARE HIDDEN WAYS\n\n\nThe rain, fine and needle-like, stung Val's face. There were ominous\npools of water gathering in the garden depressions. Even the small\nstream which bisected their land had grown from a shallow trickle into a\nthick, mud-streaked roll crowned with foam.\n\nBut the bayou was the worst. It had put off its everyday sleepiness with\na roar. A chicken coop wallowed by as the boy struggled with the knot of\nthe painter which held the outboard. And after the coop traveled a dead\ntree, its topmost branches bringing up against the plantation landing\nwith a crack. Val waited for it to whirl on before he got on board his\ncraft.\n\nThe adventure was more serious than he had thought. It might not be a\ncase of merely going downstream and into the swamp to the cabin; it\nmight be a case of fighting the rising water in grim battle. Why he did\nnot turn back to the house then and there he never knew. What would have\nhappened if he had? he sometimes speculated afterward. If Ricky had not\ncome into the garden to hunt him? If together they had not--\n\nWhile Val went with the current, his voyage was ease itself. But when he\nstrove to cut across and so reach the mouth of the hidden swamp-stream,\nhe narrowly escaped upsetting. As it was, he fended off some dark blot\nbobbing through the water, his palm meeting it with a force that jarred\nhis bones.\n\nBut he did make the mouth of the swamp-stream. Switching on the strong\nsearch-light in the bow, he headed on. And because he was moving now\nagainst the current, it seemed that he lost two feet for every one that\nhe advanced.\n\nThe muddy water was whipped into foam where it tore around shrub and\nwillow. There were no longer any confining banks, only a waste of water\nglittering through the dark foliage. The drear habitat of the vultures\nwas being swept bare by the scouring of the incoming streams, but its\nmoldy stench still arose stronger than ever, as if some foulness were\nbeing stirred up from its ancient bed.\n\nIt was only by chance that Val found the drying rack which marked the\nboundary of Jeems' property. Here the land was higher than the flood,\nwhich had not yet spread inland. He tied the boat to a willow and\nsplashed ashore. In the lower portions of the path his feet sank into\npatches of wet. Something which might have been--and probably was--a\nsnake oozed away from the beam of his pocket torch.\n\nThe clearing was much as it had been, save that the door of the\nchicken-run stood ajar and its feathered population was gone. But under\nthe cabin Val saw the betraying sparkle of water. The bayou in the rear\nmust have topped flood level.\n\nSomeone had been there before him. The lock was battered and there had\nbeen an attempt to pry loose its staples, an attempt which had left\nbetraying gouges on the door frame. But misused as it had been, the lock\nyielded to the key and Val went in. Warned by a lapping sound from\nbeneath, it did not take him long to get the chest, relock the door, and\nhead back to the boat.\n\nHe was none too soon. Already, in the few moments of his absence, there\nwere rills cutting across the mud, rills which were growing in strength\nand size. And the flood around the drying rack was up a good three\ninches. Val dumped the chest into the bow with little ceremony and\nclimbed in after it, his wet trousers clinging damply to his legs.\nSomething plate-armored and possessing wicked yellow eyes swam\neffortlessly through the light beam--a 'gator bound for the Gulf,\nwhether he would or no.\n\nThe return as far as the bayou was easy enough, for again the boat was\nborne on the current. But when Val faced the torn waters of the river he\nexperienced a certain tightness of throat and chill of blood. What might\nhave been the roof of a small shed was passing lumpily as he hesitated.\nThen came a tree burdened with a small 'coon which stared at the boy\npiteously, its eyes green in the light. An eddy sent its ship close to\nthe boat; the top branches clung a moment to the bow. And to Val's\nsurprise, the 'coon roused itself to a mighty effort and crossed into\nthe egg-shell safety the boat offered. Once in the outboard, it\nretreated to the bow where it crouched beside the chest and kept a wary\neye on Val's every movement.\n\n[Illustration: _Then came a tree burdened with a small 'coon which\nstared at the boy piteously, its eyes green in the light._]\n\nBut he could not rescue the wildcat which swept by spitting at the water\nfrom a log, nor the shivering doe which awaited the coming of death,\nmarooned on an islet which was fast being cut away by the hungry waters.\nAnd all the time the stinging rain fed the flood.\n\nVal gripped the rudder until the bar was printed deep across his palm.\nSoon it would be too late. He must cross now, heading diagonally\ndownstream to escape the full fury of the current. With a deep breath he\nturned out into the bayou.\n\nIt was like fighting some vast animated feather-bed. His greatest\nefforts were as nothing against the overpowering sweep seaward. And\nthere was constant danger from the floating booty of the storm. The\nmuddy spray lashed his body, filling the bottom of his craft as if it\nwere a tea-cup. And once the boat was whirled almost around.\n\nVal was beginning to wonder just how long a swimmer might last in that\nblack fog of rain, wind, and water when his bow eased into comparatively\nquiet water. He had crossed the main current; now was the time to head\nupstream. Grimly he did, to begin a struggle which was to take on all\nthe more horrible properties of a nightmare. For this was many times\nworse than his fight against the swamp-stream.\n\nTwice the engine sputtered protestingly and Val thought of trying to\nleap ashore. But stubbornly the outboard fought on. If there ever were a\nsturdy ship, fit to be named with Columbus' gallant craft or Hudson's\nvessel, it was that frail outboard which buffeted the rising waters of a\nLouisiana bayou gone flood mad.\n\nIt achieved the impossible; it crept upstream inch by inch, escaping\ndisaster after disaster by the thinness of a dime. Since he had\napparently not been born to drown, Val thought as he saw his headlight\ntouch the tip of the landing, he would doubtless depart this life by\nhanging.\n\nThen his light picked out something else which lay between him and the\nlanding. The sleek, knife-bowed cruiser certainly did not belong to\nPirate's Haven. And what neighbor would come calling by water on such a\nnight? It was moored by two thick ropes to a sunken post, and already\nthe mooring was dragging the bow down. Val headed in toward it, running\nthe outboard between the stranger and the landing.\n\nOut of the blackness ashore a shadow arose and waved at him frenziedly.\nThen he saw Ricky's white face above her long oil-silk cape. Her hair\nwas plastered tight to her skull and she was protecting her eyes from\nthe fury of the rain with her hands.\n\nVal sent the boat inshore until it bit into the crumbling surface of the\nlevee with a shock which threatened his balance. Ricky snatched at the\npainter and held steady while he jumped. They made the boat fast and Val\nlanded the chest. The passenger did his own disembarking, making his way\ninto the garden without a backward look. Then Val demanded an\nexplanation.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" he tried to out-screech the wind.\n\nIn answer she clapped her wet, muddy hand across his mouth and pulled\nhim back from the levee.\n\nThey reached the semi-shelter of a rotting summer-house where he put\ndown the chest. Ricky pushed her wet hair out of her eyes. It was\nimpossible for them to hear each other without screaming madly.\n\n\"Jeems told me--after you left--Val! How could you be so mad!\"\n\n\"I made it.\" He touched the chest with his toe. \"After we had\npractically kidnapped him, we couldn't let his belongings just float\naway. But why are you out here? And where did that boat come from?\"\n\n\"I came out here after Jeems told me. I'm all right.\" She laughed\nshakily. \"I've got my oldest clothes on--and this,\" she touched her\ncape. \"I couldn't stay in there--waiting--after I knew. And I didn't\nwant Rupert to ask questions. So I said that I was going to bed with a\nheadache. Then I slipped out here to the levee. And I hadn't been here\ntwo minutes before that boat came downstream. There were four men in it\nand they got out and went into the bushes over there. And, Val, Rupert\nis down at the other end of the garden where they are having trouble\nwith the levee. Holmes and Creighton went down to see if they could\nhelp, too, just after you left. There's nobody but Charity up at the\nhouse with Lucy and Letty-Lou. Val, what are we going to do?\" she\nappealed to him.\n\n\"First I'll investigate these visitors,\" he said easily, though he felt\nfar from easy within.\n\n\"Me too,\" she said firmly if ungrammatically, and since Val could not\nwait to argue, she went along.\n\nThey took the route she had watched the invaders follow, wriggling\nthrough wet bushes and around trees.\n\n\"Val, look out!\" She grabbed his arm and so saved him from tumbling\nheadlong into a black hole in the ground. Vines and a small shrub or two\nhad been ruthlessly torn out to bare the opening. It was here that the\nvisitors must have gone to earth. And then Val had a glimmering of the\ntruth; the \"Boss\" and his friends had at last found Jeems' private door.\n\nPrudence urged that they return to the house and send Sam Two or some\nother messenger down to the cross-roads store to summon the police by\nphone. Prudence however had never successfully advised any Ralestone.\nThey had a decided taste for fighting their own battles. So, torch in\nhand, Val dropped into the hole. And a moment later Ricky slid down to\njoin him.\n\nThey stood in a rough passage. Stout timbers banked its sides and\nguarded the roof. There was a damp underground smell such as Val had\nnoted in the cellar of the house, but the air was fresh enough. After\nthe first hasty survey, the boy held his fingers over the bulb of the\nflashlight so that only the faintest glimmer escaped to light their\npath.\n\nThe passage was short, ending abruptly in a low bricked room. Save for\nthemselves, a tangle of rotting rope in a far corner, and two lively\nblack beetles, it was empty.\n\n\"Val,\" Ricky's throaty whisper reached him, \"can't you guess what this\nis? The first pirate Ralestone's storage-house!\"\n\nIt was a likely enough explanation--though nothing could have been\nstored there very long; the place was too damp. Beads of slimy moisture\nfrom the walls dripped slowly down, shining like silver in the light.\n\nAt the other side of the room was a corridor branching away. But this\nthey barely glanced into, little knowing how that neglect was to prove\ndisastrous in the end. It was the main door to their right which\ninterested them most, for that led, so far as Val could determine,\ntoward the house. And that must have been the one the mysterious\nvisitors had followed.\n\nThus they came into the second of their pirate ancestor's store-rooms.\nThis one was long and narrow. Three wooden casks eaten with decay and\nspotted with fungus stood against the wall, testifying to the use to\nwhich this chamber had been put, though the all-pervading damp could not\nhave been good for the wine.\n\nAgain a dark archway tempted them on, and the third room into which they\ncame had a more grim reminder of the scarlet past of the house. For\nRicky stumbled over something which clinked dully. And when Val used the\nflash they looked down upon a telltale length of chain ending in an iron\nring, its other end soldered into the wall.\n\n\"Val,\" Ricky's voice quavered, \"did--did they keep people here?\"\n\n\"Slaves, perhaps,\" her brother answered soberly and shoved the rusting\nmetal aside with his foot. But there were two other chains hanging from\nthe wall, speaking of past horrors of which he did not care to think.\n\nAnd then as their light picked out these damning testimonials, Val\nthought that the Ralestones, for all their pride and fine, brave airs,\nhad been only pirates after all, akin to those whom they were now\nhunting through the dark.\n\nThere was a low arched doorway of brick on the right side of the room,\nand this they passed through. Beyond were three broad stone steps, worn\na little on the treads, one cracked clear across. These led to a wide\nlanding paved with brick. Here the walls were brick as well. Ricky\ntouched one involuntarily and drew back her hand with a little\nexclamation of disgust. She wiped her palm vigorously on the wet surface\nof her cape.\n\nEverywhere was the smell of rot and slow, vile decay. In spite of its\nhistorical associations, decided Val, this vault should be sealed\nforever from the daylight and left to the sole occupancy of those\nnameless things which creep in its dark. The very air, in spite of its\nfreshness, seemed tainted.\n\nAnother flight of stairs was before them, the treads fashioned of stone\nbut equipped with a rotted wooden hand-rail. And above was the faint\nreflection of light and the sound of voices. Val hesitated and realized\nfor the first time how foolhardy their expedition was.\n\nThose above would be prepared to handle interruptions. Val was\ndetermined to keep Ricky out of trouble, and to go on alone was the\nrankest folly. But, as he hesitated, the decision was taken out of his\nhands, for the light above suddenly became brighter. Grabbing at Ricky's\narm, he stumbled back into the shelter of the archway, pulling her after\nhim.\n\nA round circle of light shone plainly at the top of the stairs. Someone\nwas coming down. Ricky's breath was warm on Val's cheek and she moved\nwith a faint crackling of her cape which sounded as loud as a\nthunderclap in his ears.\n\n\"How're we gonna do it without bustin' the wall down?\" demanded an\naggrieved voice from the top of the stairs. \"There ain't no knob, no\nhandle, no nothin' to work it from this side. And these guys what stored\ntheir stuff here in the boot-leggin' days never got into the house.\"\n\n\"The boy got through, didn't he?\" Val knew that voice, the Boss of the\nswamp meeting. \"Well, if he did, we can.\"\n\n\"Lissen, Boss, it's a secret, ain't it? An' we gotta know how it works\nbefore we can work it. An' lissen here, you swamp bum, you keep outta my\nway--see? I don't care if you were one of Mike Flanigan's boys; that\ndon't cut no ice with me.\" This truculent warning must have been\naddressed to an unseen companion on the same stair level. The listeners\nbelow heard a faint sound which might have marked a collision and then\nthe hiss of swamp French spoken hurriedly and angrily.\n\n\"What're you gonna do now, Boss?\"\n\nThe light half-way down the stairs paused. \"There is some way of opening\nthat panel--\"\n\n\"An' we gotta find it. All right, all right. But tell me how.\"\n\n\"I don't know whether it will be necessary to open it--from this side.\"\n\n\"What d'ya mean?\"\n\n\"Use that thick skull of yours, Red. Doors swing two ways, don't they?\nThey can be used either to go in or to go out.\"\n\n\"Got it!\" The thick voice was oily with flattering approval. \"We can get\nout this way--\"\n\n\"Smart work, Red. Did you think that out all by yourself?\" asked the\nother contemptuously. \"Yes, we can come out this way when\"--his voice\nwas sharp with purpose--\"we are finished. Send one of these swampers\ndown to the levee where the men are working. As long as this flood keeps\nrising we're safe. Then the other three of us will go for the house. We\nmay be seen that way, but there's no use spending any more time here\nplaying tick-tack-toe on that wood up there. We locate what we want, and\nif we're cornered we can come out through here to the bayou. Slick\nenough.\"\n\n\"Great stuff, Boss--\" Red began. But the rest was muffled, for Ricky and\nVal drew back into the room of the chains. There was only one thing to\ndo now--reach Rupert and the others and prepare to meet these skulkers\nin the open. But before they had quite crossed the room Ricky came to\ngrief. She caught her foot in one of those gruesome chains and stumbled\nforward, falling on her hands and knee. The noise of her fall echoed\naround the low chamber with betraying clamor.\n\nA white light beat upon them as Val stooped to aid Ricky.\n\n\"Stop!\" came the shout, but Val had only one thought, to dim that light.\nHe swung back his arm and flung his own flash straight at the other.\nThere was a grunt of pain and the light fell to the floor. With the\ntinkle of breaking glass it went out. Val pulled Ricky to her feet and\nthrew her toward the door, forgetting everything but the wild panic\nwhich urged him out of that place of foul darkness. They bruised their\nhands against the brick as they felt for the opening, and then they were\nout in the other chamber.\n\n\"Val,\" Ricky clung to him, \"I've got that little flash I keep under my\npillow at night. Wait a minute until I get it out of my pocket. We can't\nfind our way out of here without a light.\"\n\nMuffled sounds from behind them suggested that their pursuers were on\nthe trail even without light. After all, given time enough, it would be\neasy for them to feel their way out of the vaults. Val hustled Ricky on,\ntaking his direction from one of the wine-casks he had bumped into. And\nbefore he allowed her to hunt for her torch they stood in the first of\nthe chambers.\n\nThe light she produced was poor and it flickered warningly. But it was\ngood enough for them to see the dark opening which led to the outer\nworld. They ducked into this just as the first of the other party came\ncursing into the open. At Val's orders, Ricky switched off the light and\nthey crept along by the wall, one hand on its guiding surface.\n\nBut the way seemed longer than it had upon their entering. Surely they\nshould have reached the garden entrance by now. And the surface\nunderfoot remained level instead of slanting upward. Suddenly Ricky gave\na little cry.\n\n\"We've taken the wrong passage! There's only a blank wall in front of\nus!\"\n\nShe was right. The torch showed a brick surface across their path, and\nVal remembered too late the second passage out of the first chamber.\nThey must go back and hope to elude the others in the dark.\n\n\"They may have all gone out, thinking we were still ahead of them,\" he\nmused aloud.\n\n\"Well, it's got to be done,\" Ricky observed, \"so we might as well do\nit.\"\n\nBack they went along the unknown passage. This appeared to run straight\nout from the first chamber. But why it had been fashioned and then\nwalled up they had no way of knowing. Ricky's torch picked out the\nentrance at last.\n\n\"Wait,\" Val cautioned her, \"we had better see how the land lies before\nwe go out in the open.\"\n\nThey stood listening. Save for the constant drip, drip of water, there\nwas no sound.\n\n\"I guess it's clear,\" he said.\n\n\"Wonder where all the water is coming from?\" Ricky shivered.\n\n\"Down from the garden. Come on, I think it's safe to have a light now.\"\n\nRicky must have been holding the torch upward when she pressed the\nbutton, for the round circle of light appeared on the supporting timbers\nabove the door. They both looked up, fascinated for a moment. The old\noak had been laid in a crisscross pattern, the best support possible in\nthe days when the vaults had been made.\n\n\"How wet--\" began Ricky.\n\nVal cried out suddenly and struck at her. The blow sent her sprawling\nsome three or four feet back in the passage. There might be time yet to\ncover her body with his own, he planned desperately, before--\n\nThe sound of slipping earth was all about them as Val flung himself\ntoward Ricky. As he thrust blindly at her body, rolling her back farther\ninto the tunnel, he felt the first clod strike full upon his shoulder.\nRicky's complaining whimper was the last thing he heard clearly. For in\nthe dark was the crash of breaking timber.\n\nHe was felled by a stroke across the upper arm, and then came a chill\ndarkness in which he was utterly swallowed up.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nPIECES OF EIGHT--RALESTONES' FATE!\n\n\nThrough the dull roaring which filled his ears Val heard a sharp call:\n\n\"Val! Val, where are you? Val!\"\n\nHe stared up into utter blackness.\n\n\"Val!\"\n\n\"Here, Ricky!\" But that thin thread of a whisper surely didn't belong to\nhim. He tried again and achieved a sort of croak. Something moved behind\nhim and there was an answering rattle of falling clods.\n\n\"Val, I'm afraid to move,\" her voice wavered unsteadily. \"It seems to be\nfalling yet. Where are you?\"\n\nThe boy tried to investigate, only to find himself more securely\nfastened than if he had been scientifically bound. And now that the\nmists had cleared from him, his spine and back felt a sharp pain to\nwhich he was no stranger. From his breast-bone down he was held as if in\na vise.\n\n\"Are you hurt, Ricky?\" He formed the words slowly. Every breath he drew\nthrust a red-hot knife between his ribs. He turned his head toward her,\npillowing his cheek on the gritty clay.\n\n\"No. But where are you, Val? Can't you come to me?\"\n\n\"Sorry. Un--unavoidably detained,\" he gasped. \"Don't try any crawling or\nthe rest may come down on us.\"\n\n\"Val! What's the matter? Are you hurt?\" Her questions cut sharply\nthrough the darkness.\n\n\"Banged up a little. No\"--he heard the rustle which betrayed her\nmovements--\"don't try to come to me--Please, Ricky!\"\n\nBut with infinite caution she came, until her brother felt the edge of\nher cape against his face. Then her questing hand touched his throat and\nslid downward to his shoulders.\n\n\"Val!\" He knew what horror colored that cry as she came upon what\nimprisoned him.\n\n\"It's all right, Ricky. I'm just pinned in. If I don't try to move I'm\nsafe.\" Quickly he tried to reassure her.\n\n\"Val, don't lie to me now--you're hurt!\"\n\n\"It's not bad, really, Ricky--\"\n\n\"Oh!\" There was a single small cry and a moment of utter silence and\nthen a hurried rustling.\n\n\"Here.\" Her hand groped for his head. \"I've wadded up my cape. Can I\nslip it under your head?\"\n\n\"Better not try just yet. Anything might send off the landslide again.\nJust--just give me a minute or two to--to sort of catch my breath.\"\nCatch his breath, when every sobbing gasp he drew was a stab!\n\n\"Can't we--can't I lift some of the stuff off?\" she asked.\n\n\"No. Too risky.\"\n\n\"But--but we can't stay here--\" Her voice trailed off and it was then\nthat she must have realized for the first time just what had happened to\nthem.\n\n\"I'm afraid we'll have to, Ricky,\" said her brother quietly.\n\n\"But, Val--Val, what if--if--\"\n\n\"If we aren't found?\" he put her fear into words. \"But we will be.\nRupert is doubtless moving a large amount of earth right now to\naccomplish that.\"\n\n\"Rupert doesn't know where we are.\" She had regained control of both\nvoice and spirit. \"We--we may never be found, Val.\"\n\n\"I was a fool,\" he stated plainly a fact which he now knew to be only\ntoo true.\n\n\"I would have come even if you hadn't, Val,\" she answered generously and\nuntruthfully. It was perhaps the kindest thing she had ever said.\n\nNow that the noise of the catastrophe had died away they could hear\nagain the drip of water. And that sound tortured Val's dry throat. A\nglass of cool water--He turned his head restlessly.\n\n\"If we only had a light,\" came Ricky's wish.\n\n\"The flash is probably buried.\"\n\n\"Val, will--will it be fun?\"\n\n\"What?\" he demanded, suddenly alert at her tone. Had the dark and their\ntrouble made her light-headed?\n\n\"Being a ghost. We--we could walk the hall with Great-uncle Rick; he\nwouldn't begrudge us that.\"\n\n\"Ricky! Stop it!\"\n\nHer answering laugh, though shaky, was sane enough.\n\n\"I do pick the wrong times to display my sense of humor, don't I? Val,\nis it so very bad?\"\n\nSomething within him crumbled at that question.\n\n\"Not so good, Lady,\" he replied in spite of the resolutions he had made.\n\nShe brushed back the hair glued by perspiration to his forehead. Ricky\nwas not gold, he thought, for gold is a rather dirty thing. But she was\nall steel, as clean and shining as a blade fresh from the hands of a\nmaster armorer. He made a great effort and found that he could move his\nright arm an inch or two. Concentrating all his strength there, he\nwriggled it back and forth until he could draw it free from the\nwreckage. But his left shoulder and side were numb save for the pain\nwhich came and went.\n\n\"Got my arm free,\" Val told her exultantly and reached up to feel for\nher in the dark. His fingers closed upon coarse cloth. He pulled feebly\nand something rolled toward him.\n\n\"What's this?\"\n\nRicky's hands slid along his arm to the thing he had found. He could\nhear her exploring movements.\n\n\"It's some sort of a bundle. I wonder where it came from.\"\n\n\"Some more remains of the jolly pirate days, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Here's something else. A bag, I think. Ugh! It smells nasty! There's a\nhole in it--Oh, here's a piece of money. At least it feels like money.\nThere's more in the bag.\" She pressed a disk about as large as a\nhalf-dollar into Val's palm.\n\n\"Pirate loot--\" he began. Anything that would keep them from thinking of\nwhere they were and what had happened was to be welcomed.\n\n\"Val\"--he could hear her move uneasily--\"remember that old saying:\n'Pieces of eight--Ralestones' fate?\"\n\n\"All good families have curses,\" he reminded her.\n\n\"And good families can have--can have accidents, too.\"\n\nThere could be no answer to that. Nor did Val feel like answering. The\nsavage pain in his legs and back had given way to a kind of numbness. A\nchill not caused by the dank air crawled up his body. What--what if his\ninjuries were worse than he had thought? What if--if--\n\nThe dripping of the water seemed louder, and it no longer fell with the\nsame rhythm. Ricky must be counting money from the bag. He could hear\nthe clink of metal against stone as she dropped a piece.\n\n\"Don't lose it,\" he muttered foggily.\n\n\"Lose what?\"\n\n\"Your pieces of eight.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You just dropped a piece.\"\n\n\"I haven't touched--Val, do--do you feel worse?\"\n\nBut he had no thought now for his body. If Ricky had not dropped the\nmoney, then what had caused the clink? He ground his cheek against the\nclay. _Thud, thud, clink, thud._ That was not water dripping nor coin\nrattling. That was the sound of digging. And digging meant--\n\n\"Ricky! They're digging! I can hear them!\"\n\nHer fingers closed about his free hand until the nails dug into the\nflesh. \"Where?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Listen!\"\n\nThe sound had grown in strength until now, though muffled, it sounded\nthrough that part of the passage still remaining open.\n\n\"It comes from this end. From behind that wall. But why should it come\nfrom there?\"\n\n\"Does it matter? Val, do you suppose they could hear me if I pounded on\nthe wall at this side?\"\n\n\"You haven't anything heavy enough to pound with.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have. This package thing that you found. It's quite heavy. Val,\nwe've got to let them know we're here!\"\n\nShe crawled away, moving with caution lest she bring on another slide.\nThat reassuring _thud, thud_ still sounded. Then, after long minutes,\nVal heard the answering blow from their side. Three times Ricky struck\nbefore the rhythm of the digging was broken. Then there was silence\nfollowed by three sharp blows. They had heard!\n\nRicky beat a perfect tattoo in joy and was quickly answered. Then the\n_thud, thud_ began again, but this time the pace was quickened.\n\n\"They've heard! They're coming!\" Ricky's voice shrilled until it became\na scream. \"Val, we're found!\"\n\nA clod was loosened somewhere above them and crashed upon the wreckage.\nWould the efforts of their rescuers bring on another slide?\n\n\"Be quiet, Ricky,\" Val croaked a warning, \"it's still moving.\"\n\nThen there came the sharp clink of metal against stone. \"Val,\" called\nRicky, \"they're right against the wall now!\"\n\n\"Come back here, away from it. We--we don't want you caught, too,\" he\nanswered her.\n\nObediently she crawled back to him and again he felt her hand close\nabout his. The sound of metal grating against stubborn brick filled\ntheir pocket of safety. But as an ominous accompaniment came the soft\nhiss of earth sliding onto the wreckage. Which would win to them first,\nthe rescuers or the second slide?\n\nThere was a vicious grinding noise from the walled end of the passage. A\nmoment later a blinding ray of light swung in, to focus upon them.\n\n\"Ricky! Val!\"\n\nVal was blinking stupidly at the light, but Ricky had presence of mind\nenough to answer.\n\n\"Here we are!\"\n\n\"Look out,\" Val roused enough to warn, \"the walls are unsafe!\"\n\n\"We're coming through,\" rang the answer out of the dark. \"Stand away!\"\n\nNow that they could see, Val realized for the first time the danger of\ntheir position. A jagged, water-rotted beam half covered with clay and\nsand lay across him, and beyond that was a mass of splintered wood and\nwet earth. A little sick, he looked up at Ricky. She was staring at the\nwreckage. Her eyes were black in a white, mud-smeared face.\n\n\"Val--Val!\" His name came as the thinnest of whispers.\n\n\"It isn't as bad as it looks,\" he said hurriedly. \"Something underneath\nmust be supporting most of the weight or--or I wouldn't be here at all.\"\n\n\"Val,\" she repeated, and then, paying no heed to his frantic injunctions\nto keep away, she dug at earth and rotten wood with her hands. Using the\nlong bundle clumsily wrapped in stained canvas, she levered a piece of\nbeam out of the way so that she might get down on her knees and scoop up\nthe sand and clay.\n\n\"Ricky! Val!\" The light swung ahead as someone scrambled through the\nhole in the barrier wall. Then, when the ray held firm upon them, the\nheadlong rush was checked for a long instant. \"Val!\"\n\n\"Get her--away,\" he begged. \"Another--slip--\"\n\nBut before he had done, a long arm gathered Ricky up as if she had been\na child. \"Right,\" came the firm answer. \"Sam, take Miss 'Chanda back.\nThen--\"\n\nVal was watching the reflection of the flash on the broken roof above\nhim. Sand slid in tiny streams down the wall, mingling with the greenish\ntrickles of water. There were queer blue and green arcs painted on the\nbrick which had something to do with the hot pain behind his eyes. The\nblue turned to orange--to scarlet--\n\n\"Careful! Right here in the hall, Holmes--\"\n\nThe broken earth above him had somehow been changed to a high ceiling,\nthe chill darkness to blazing light and warmth.\n\n\"Ricky?\" he asked.\n\n\"Here, Val.\" Her face was very close to his.\n\n\"You--are--all--right?\"\n\n\"'Course!\" But she was crying. \"Don't try to talk, Val. You must be\nquiet.\"\n\nHe heard someone moving toward them but he kept his eyes on Ricky's\nface. \"We did it!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered slowly, \"we did it.\"\n\n\"Val, don't try to talk.\" Rupert's face showed above Ricky's hunched\nshoulder. There was an odd, strained look about his mouth, a smear of\nmud across his cheek. But the harsh tone of his voice struck his brother\nas dumb as if he had slapped him.\n\n\"Sorry,\" Val shaped the words stiffly, \"all my fault.\"\n\n\"Nothing's your fault,\" Ricky's indignant answer cut in. \"But--but just\nbe quiet, Val, until the doctor comes.\"\n\nHe turned his head slowly. On the hearth-stone stood Charity talking\nquietly to Holmes. Just within the circle of the firelight lay a bundle\nwhich he had seen before. But of course, that was the thing they had\nfound in the passage, which Ricky had used to pound out their answer to\nRupert.\n\n\"Ricky--\" Val always believed that it was some instinct out of the past\nwhich forced that whisper out of him--\"Ricky, open that package.\"\n\n\"Why--\" she began, but then she got to her feet and went to the bundle,\ntwisting the tarred rope that fastened it in a vain attempt to undo the\nintricate knots. It was Holmes who produced a knife and sawed through\nthe tough cord. And it was Holmes who unrolled the strips of canvas,\noil-silk, and greasy skins. But it was Ricky who took up what lay within\nand held it out so that it reflected both red firelight and golden room\nlight.\n\nHer brother's sigh was one of satisfaction.\n\nFor Ricky held aloft by its ponderous hilt a great war sword. There\ncould be no doubt in any of them--the Luck of Lorne had returned.\n\n[Illustration: _Ricky held aloft a great war sword. There could be no\ndoubt in any of them--the Luck of Lorne had returned._]\n\n\"We found it!\" breathed Ricky.\n\n\"Put it in its place,\" Val ordered.\n\nWithout a word, Rupert drew out a chair and scrambled up. Taking from\nRicky's hands the ancient weapon, he slipped it into the niche their\npirate ancestor had made for it. In spite of the years underground, the\nmetal of hilt and blade was clear. Seven hundred years of history--their\nLuck!\n\n\"Everything will come right again,\" Val repeated as Ricky came back to\nhim. \"You'll see. Everything--will--be--all--right.\"\n\nHis eyes closed in spite of his efforts. He was back in the darkness\nwhere he could only feel the warmth of Ricky's hands clasped about his.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nRALESTONES STAND TOGETHER\n\n\n\"I like Louisiana,\" drawled Holmes lazily from his perch on the\nwindow-seat. \"The most improbable things happen here. One finds secret\npassages under houses and medieval war swords stuck in drains. Then\nthere are 'things that go boomp in the night,' too. It might be worth\nsettling down here--\"\n\n\"Not for you,\" cut in Charity briskly. \"Too far from the bright lights\nfor you, my man.\"\n\n\"Just for that,\" he triumphed, \"I shall not return this lost property\nfound under a cushion of the couch in the hall.\"\n\nAt the sight of that familiar black note-book, Val shifted uneasily on\nhis pillows. Rupert got up.\n\n\"Tired, old man?\" he asked and reached to straighten one of his\nbrother's feather-stuffed supports.\n\nVal shook his head. Being bandaged like a mummy was wearying, but one\nhad to humor two broken ribs and a fractured collar-bone.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" replied Charity, \"you are just too clever, Mr. Judson\nHolmes. That does not happen to be my property.\"\n\n\"No?\" He flipped it open and held it up so that she might see what lay\nwithin. \"I'll admit that it isn't your usual sort of stuff, but--\"\n\nShe was staring at the drawings. \"No, that isn't mine. But who--\"\n\nRicky got up from the end of Val's cot and went to look. Then she\nturned, her eyes shining with excitement. \"You're trying them again!\nBut, Val, you said you never would.\"\n\n\"Give me that book!\" he ordered grimly. But Rupert had calmly collected\nthe trophy and was turning over the pages one by one. Val made a\nhorrible face at Ricky and resigned himself to the inevitable.\n\n\"How long have you been doing this sort of thing?\" his brother asked as\nhe turned the last page.\n\n\"Ever so long,\" Ricky answered for Val brightly. \"He used to draw whole\nletters of them when we were at school. There were two sets, one for\ngood days and the other for bad.\"\n\n\"And now,\" Val cut in, \"suppose we just forget the whole matter. Will\nyou please let me have that!\"\n\n\"Rupert, don't let him go all modest on us now,\" urged the demon sister.\n\"One retiring violet in the family is enough.\"\n\n\"And who is the violet? Your charming self?\" inquired Holmes.\n\n\"No.\" Ricky smiled pleasantly. \"Only Mr. Creighton might be interested\nin the contents of Bluebeard's Chamber. What do you think, Rupert?\"\n\nAt that audacious hint, Val remembered the night of the storm and\nRicky's strange attitude then.\n\n\"So Rupert's the missing author,\" he commented lightly. \"Well, well,\nwell.\"\n\nCharity's indulgent smile faded, and Holmes, suddenly alert, leaned\nforward. Rupert stared at Val for a long moment, his face blank. Was he\ngoing to retire behind his wall of reserve from which their venture\nunderground had routed him? Or was he going to remain the very human\nperson who had spent eight hours of every day at his brother's beck and\ncall for the past few weeks?\n\n\"Regular Charlie Chan, aren't you?\" he asked mildly.\n\nVal's sigh of relief was echoed by Ricky. \"Thanks--so much,\" Val replied\nhumbly in the well-known manner of the famous detective Rupert had\nlikened him to.\n\n\"Then we are right?\" asked Ricky.\n\nRupert's eyebrows slid upward. \"You seemed too sure to be in doubt,\" he\ncommented.\n\n\"Well, I was sure at times. But then no one can ever be really sure of\nanything about you,\" she admitted frankly.\n\n\"But why--\" protested Charity.\n\n\"Why didn't I spread the glad tidings that I was turning out the great\nAmerican novel?\" he asked. \"I don't know. Perhaps I am a violet--no?\" He\nlooked pained at Ricky's snort of dissent. \"Or perhaps I just don't like\nto talk about things which may never come true. When I didn't hear from\nLever, I thought that my worst forebodings were realized and that my\nscribbling was worthless. But you know,\" he paused to fill his pipe,\n\"writing is more or less like the drug habit. I've told stories all my\nlife, and I found myself tied to my typewriter in spite of my\ndisappointment. As for talking about it--well, how much has Val ever\nsaid about these?\" He ruffled the pages of the note-book provokingly.\n\n\"Nothing. And you would never have seen those if I could have prevented\nit,\" his brother replied. \"Those are for my private satisfaction only.\"\n\n\"Two geniuses in one family.\" Ricky rolled her eyes heavenward. \"This is\nalmost too, too much!\"\n\n\"Jeems,\" Val ordered, \"you're the nearest. Can't you make her shut up?\"\n\n\"Just let him try,\" said his sister sweetly. The swamper grinned but\nmade no move to stir from his chair.\n\nJeems had become as much a part of Pirate's Haven as the Luck, which Val\ncould see from his cot glimmering dully in its niche in the Long Hall.\nThe swamper's confinement in the sick-room had paled his heavy tan and\nhe had lost the sullen frown which had made him appear so old and\nbitter. Now, dressed in a pair of Val's white slacks and a shirt from\nhis wardrobe, Jeems was as much at ease in his surroundings as Rupert or\nHolmes.\n\nIt had been Jeems who had saved Ricky and Val on that night of terror\nwhen they had been trapped in the secret ways of their pirate ancestors.\nSam Two had trailed Ricky to the garden and had witnessed their entering\nthe tunnel. But his racial fear of the dark unknown had kept him from\nventuring in after them. So he had lingered there long enough to see the\ninvaders come out and take to the river. Catching some words of theirs\nabout a cave-in, he had gone pelting off to Rupert with the story.\n\nThe investigating party from the levee had discovered, to their horror,\nthe passage choked for half its length. They were making a futile and\ndangerous attempt to clear it when Jeems appeared on the scene.\nLetty-Lou having given him a garbled account of events, he had staggered\nfrom his bed in an effort to reach Rupert. He alone knew the underground\nways as well as he knew the garden. And so once getting Rupert's\nattention, he had set them to work in the cellar cutting through to the\none passage which paralleled the foundation walls.\n\nIn the weeks which followed their emergence from the threatened tomb,\nthe swamper had unobtrusively slipped into a place in the household.\nWhile Val was frightening his family by indulging in a bout of fever to\ncomplicate his injuries, Jeems was proving himself a tower of strength\nand a person to be relied upon. Even Lucy had once asked his opinion on\nthe importance of a fire in the hall, and with that his position was\nassured.\n\nOf the invaders they had heard or seen no more, although the police had\nvisited Pirate's Haven on two separate occasions, interviewing each and\nevery member of the household. They had also made a half-hearted attempt\nto search the swamp. But for all the evidence they found, Ricky and Val\nmight have been merely indulging in an over-vivid dream. Save that the\nLuck hung again in the Long Hall.\n\n\"Seriously, though,\" Holmes drew Val's thoughts out of the past, \"these\nare worth-while. Would you mind if I showed them to a friend of mine who\nmight be interested?\"\n\nSince Rupert had already nodded and Charity had handed him the\nnote-book, Val decided that he could hardly raise a protest.\n\n\"Rupert,\" Charity glanced at him, \"are you going to see Creighton?\"\n\n\"Since all has been discovered,\" he misquoted, \"I suppose that that is\nall there is left for me to do.\"\n\n\"Then you had better do it today; he's planning to leave for the North\ntonight,\" she informed him.\n\nRupert came to life. For all his pose of unconcern, he was excited. In\nthe long days Val had been tied to the cot hurriedly set up in a corner\nof the drawing-room on the night of the rescue--it had been thought\nwiser to move him no farther than necessary--he had found again the real\nRupert they had known of old. There was little he could conceal from his\nyounger brother now--or so Val thought.\n\n\"Sam has the roadster,\" Rupert said. \"There's something wrong with the\nbrakes and I told him to take it to town and have it looked over.\nGoodness only knows what time he'll be back.\"\n\n\"See here, Ralestone,\" Holmes looked at his wrist-watch, \"I've the car I\nhired here with me. Let me drive you in. Charity has to go, anyway, and\nsee about sending off those sketches of hers.\"\n\n\"Oh, but we were going together,\" protested Ricky. \"I have some shopping\nto do.\"\n\n\"Very simple,\" Val suggested. \"Why don't you all go?\"\n\n\"But that would leave you alone.\" Rupert shook his head.\n\n\"No. There's Jeems.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Rupert hesitated doubtfully.\n\n\"It doesn't require more than one person to wait on me at present,\" Val\nsaid firmly. \"Now all of you go. But remember, I shall expect the Greeks\nto return bearing gifts.\"\n\nHolmes saluted. \"Right you are, my hearty. Well, ladies, the chariot\nawaits without.\"\n\nIn spite of their protests, Val at last got rid of them. Since he had a\nproject of his own, he was only too glad to see the last of his\noversolicitous family for awhile.\n\nVal had never been able to understand why broken ribs or a fractured\ncollar-bone should chain one to the bed. And since he had recovered from\nhis wrenched back he was eager to be up and around. In private, with the\nprotesting assistance of Sam Two, he had made a pilgrimage across the\nroom and back. And now it was his full intention to be seated on the\nterrace when the family came home.\n\nIt was Lucy of all people who aided fortune to give him his opportunity.\n\n\"Mistuh Val,\" she announced from the doorway as the sound of the car\npulling out of the drive signaled the departure of the city-bound party,\n\"dem lights is out agin.\"\n\n\"Another fuse gone? That's the second this week. Who's been playing\ngames?\" he asked.\n\n\"Dis heah no-'count!\" She dragged out of hiding from behind her\nvoluminous skirts her second son, a chocolate-brown infant who rejoiced\nin the name of Gustavus Adolphus and was generally called \"Doff.\" At\nthat moment he was sobbing noisily and eyeing Val as if the boy were the\nGrand High Executioner of Tartary. \"Yo'all tell Mistuh Val whats yo' bin\na-doin'!\" commanded his mother, emphasizing her order with a shake.\n\n\"Ain't done nothin',\" wailed Doff. \"Sam, he give me de penny an' say,\n'Le's hab fun.' Den Ah puts de penny in de lil' hole an' den Mammy cotch\nme.\"\n\n\"Doff seems to be the victim, Lucy,\" Val observed. \"Where's Sam?\"\n\n\"Ah don' know. But I'se a-goin' to fin' out!\" she stated with ominous\ndetermination. \"How's Ah a-goin' to git mah ironin' done when dere ain't\nno heat fo' de iron? Ah asks yo' dat!\"\n\n\"There are some fuses in the pantry and Jeems will put one in for you,\"\nVal promised.\n\nWith a sniff Lucy withdrew, her fingers still hooked in the collar of\nher tearful son. Jeems glanced at Val as he went by the boy's cot. And\nVal didn't care for what he read into that glance. Had the swamper by\nany foul chance come to suspect Val's little plan?\n\nBut it all turned out just as he had hoped. Val made that most momentous\ntrip in four easy stages, resting on the big chair where Rupert had\nspent so many hours, on the bench by the window, in the first of the\ndeck-chairs by the side of the French doors leading to the terrace, and\nthen he reached the haven of the last deck-chair and settled down just\nwhere he had intended. And when Jeems returned there was nothing he\ncould do but accept the fact that Val had fled the cot.\n\n\"Miss Ricky won't like this,\" he prophesied darkly. \"Nor Mr. Rupert\nneither. Yo' wouldn't've tried it if they'd been heah.\"\n\n\"Oh, stop worrying. If you'd been tied to that cot the way I've been,\nyou'd be glad to get out here, too. It's great!\"\n\nThe sun was warm but the afternoon shadow of an oak overhung his seat so\nthat Val escaped the direct force of the rays. A few feet away Satan\nsprawled full length, giving a fine imitation of a cat that had rid\nhimself of all nine lives, or at least of eight and a half.\n\nNever had the garden shown so rich a green. Ricky's care had sharpened\nthe lines of the flower-beds and had set shrubs in their proper places.\nAnd the plants had repaid her with a riot of blossoms. A breeze set the\ngray moss to swaying from the branches of the oak. And a green\ngrasshopper crossed the terrace in four great leaps, almost scraping\nSatan's ear in a fashion which might easily have been fatal to the\ninsect. Val sighed and slipped down lower in his chair. \"It's great,\" he\nmurmured again.\n\n\"Sure is,\" Jeems echoed. He dropped down cross-legged beside Val,\ndisdaining the other chair.\n\nSatan stretched without opening his eyes and yawned, gaping to the\nfullest extent of his jaws and curling his tongue upward so that it\nseemed pointed like a snake's. Then he rolled over on his other side and\ncurled up with his paws under his chin. A bumblebee blundered by Val's\nhead on its way to visit the morning-glories. He suddenly discovered it\ndifficult to keep his eyes open.\n\n\"Someone's comin',\" observed Jeems. \"Ah just heard a car turn in from\nthe road.\"\n\n\"But the folks have been gone such a short time,\" Val protested.\n\nHowever, the car which came almost noiselessly down the drive was not\nthe one in which the family had departed. It had the shape of a sleek\ngray beetle, rounded so that it was difficult to tell at first glance\nthe hood from the rear. It glided to a stop before the steps and after a\nmoment four passengers disembarked.\n\nVal simply stared, but Jeems got to his feet in one swift movement.\n\nFor, coming purposefully up the terrace steps, were four men they had\nseen before and had very good cause to remember for the rest of their\nlives.\n\nIn the lead strutted the rival, a tight smile rendering his unlovely\nfeatures yet more disagreeable. Behind him trotted the red-faced\ncounselor who had accompanied him on his first visit. But matching the\nrival step for step was the \"Boss,\" while \"Red\" brought up the rear in a\ntidy fashion.\n\n\"Swell place, ain't it?\" demanded the rival, taking no notice of Val or\nJeems. \"Make yourselves to home, boys; the place is yours.\"\n\nVal gripped the arm of his chair. Sam, Rupert, Holmes--they were all\nbeyond call. It was left to him to meet this unbelievable invasion\nalone. There was a stir beside him. Val glanced up to meet the slightest\nof reassuring nods from the swamper. Jeems was with him.\n\n\"Whatcha gonna do with the joint, Brick?\" asked Red, tossing his\ncigarette down on the flagstones and grinding it to powder with his\nheel.\n\n\"I dunno yet.\" The rival strode importantly toward the front door.\n\n\"You might tell us when you find out,\" Val suggested quietly.\n\nWith an exaggerated start of surprise the rival turned toward the boy.\n\n\"Oh, so it's you, kid?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Val said softly, \"you had better introduce your friends.\nAfter all, I like to know the names of my guests.\"\n\nThe Boss smiled sardonically and Red grinned. Only the red-faced lawyer\nshuffled his feet uneasily and looked from one to another of his\ncompanions with an expression of pleading. But the rival came directly\nto the point.\n\n\"Where's that high and mighty brother of yours?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Mr. Ralestone will doubtless be very glad to see you,\" Val evaded,\nhaving no desire for the visitors to discover just how slender his\nresources were. \"Jeems, you might go and tell him that we have visitors.\nGo through the Long Hall, it's nearer that way.\" He dug the fingernails\nof his sound hand into the soft wood of the chair arm. Could Jeems\ninterpret that hint? Someone must remove and hide the Luck before these\nmen saw it.\n\n\"Right.\" The swamper turned on his heel and padded toward the French\nwindows.\n\n\"No, you don't!\" the rival snarled as he moved into line between Jeems\nand his objective. \"When we want that guy, we'll hunt him out ourselves.\nWhen we're good and ready!\"\n\n\"If you don't wish to see my brother, just why did you come?\" Val asked\nfeverishly. He must keep them talking there until he had time to think\nof some way of getting that slender blade of steel into hiding.\n\n\"We're movin' in,\" Red answered casually for them all.\n\n\"How interesting. I think that the police will enjoy hearing that,\" Val\ncommented.\n\n\"It's perfectly legal,\" bleated the lawyer. \"We possess a court order to\nview the place with the purpose of appraising it for sale.\" He drew a\nstiff paper from the inside pocket of his coat and waved it toward the\nboy.\n\n\"Bunk! I don't know much about the law but I do know that you could have\nobtained nothing of the kind without our being notified. And just which\none of you has been selected to do the appraising?\"\n\n\"Him,\" answered Red laconically and jerked his thumb at the Boss.\n\n\"So,\" Jeems stared at him, \"since yo' couldn't git what yo' want by\nthievin' at night, yo're goin' to try and git it by day.\"\n\n\"But what are you really after? I'm curious to know. You certainly don't\nwant a sugar plantation which hasn't been paying its way since the Civil\nWar. That just isn't reasonable. And you ought to know that we can't\nafford to buy you off. We must be living over a gold-mine that we\nhaven't discovered. Come on, tell us where it is,\" Val prodded.\n\n\"Cut the cackle,\" advised Red, \"an' le's git down to it.\"\n\n\"I would advise you to get back in your car and drive out.\" Val wondered\nif his face looked as stiff as it felt. \"This visit isn't going to get\nyou anywhere.\"\n\n\"We ain't goin' any place, kid,\" remarked the rival. \"You don't seem to\nunderstand. We're stayin' right here. I got rights and the judge has\nrecognized them. I'm top guy here now.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Yuh ain't so smart as yuh think yuh are,\" contributed Red,\nscowling at Val. \"We ain't gonna leave.\"\n\nIt wasn't Red's speech, however, that straightened the boy's back and\nmade Jeems shift his position an inch or two. There was another car\ncoming up the drive. And since their enemies were all gathered before\nthem, they could only be receiving friends, or at the worst neutrals.\n\nBut the car which came from between the live-oaks to park behind the\nfirst contained only two passengers. LeFleur and Creighton got out,\nstopped in surprise to view the party on the terrace, and then came up,\nshoving by Red.\n\n\"Quite a party,\" Val observed. \"But how did you manage to arrive so\nopportunely?\"\n\n\"We have made a discovery,\" panted the Creole lawyer; \"a very important\ndiscovery. What are these men doing here?\"\n\n\"We got a court order to view this house for sale.\" The rival was\ntruculent. \"An' it's all legal. The mouthpiece says so,\" he indicated\nhis counselor.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Creighton's cool tones cut through, \"you had better introduce\nus.\" There was a decided change in his manner. Gone was his shy\nnervousness, his slightly hesitant reserve. It was a keen business man\nwho stood there now.\n\nVal grinned. \"You see before you the family skeleton. May I introduce\nMr. Ralestone, who firmly believes that he is the Ralestone of Pirate's\nHaven? And three other--shall we say gentlemen--whom I myself have never\nmet formally. Though I did have the pleasure, I believe,\" he addressed\nthe Boss directly, \"of blackening your eye.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm Ralestone, and I'm gonna have my rights,\" stated the rival\nbriskly.\n\n\"You are a descendant of Roderick Ralestone?\" asked LeFleur.\n\n\"Yuh know I am. I got proofs!\"\n\n\"The man is a liar,\" Creighton said calmly.\n\nAs they stared at him, LeFleur nodded. Val saw an ugly grin begin to\ncurve Red's thick lips.\n\n\"Yeah? An how do yuh know that, wise guy?\" he asked.\n\n\"Because there is only one Roderick Ralestone in this generation and he\nis standing right there. Permit me to introduce Roderick St. Jean\nRalestone!\"\n\nThe person he turned to was Jeems!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE RETURN OF RICK RALESTONE\n\n\nVal ventured to break the sudden silence which resulted from Creighton's\nastonishing statement.\n\n\"But how--why--\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" the rival had collected a measure of his scattered wits, \"whatta\nyuh mean, wise guy?\"\n\n\"Just this--\" LeFleur drew himself up and faced the invaders sternly--\"I\nhave only this very morning deposited with the probate court certain\ndocuments making very plain the identity of this young man. Without the\nshadow of a doubt he is the only living descendant of Roderick Ralestone\nand his wife, Valerie St. Jean de Roche. I have also sworn out a\ncomplaint--\"\n\nThen the Boss took a hand in the game. \"The boy's a minor,\" he observed.\n\n\"Through me,\" LeFleur returned, \"Mr. Rupert Ralestone as nearest of kin\nhas applied for guardianship and there will be no difficulty in the\nsettlement of that matter.\"\n\n\"Yeah!\" The rival threw his gloves on the terrace and glared not at\nLeFleur but at his own backing. Having stared at the lawyer of his party\nuntil that unfortunate man lost all assurance, he attacked the Boss.\n\"So, wise guy, what now? We ain't got such a snap as yuh said we were\ngonna have. We were gonna move right in and take over the joint, were\nwe? We didn't have anything to worry about. For once we was playin' with\nthe law. Yeah, we were. We are nothin' but a gang of mugs. Whatta we\ngonna do now, huh? You oughta know. Ain't yuh been doin' our thinkin'\nfor us all along? We can't grab the land and run. We gotta camp right\nhere if we're gonna git anything. And how are we gonna--\"\n\n\"Simpson!\" the Boss's voice was sharp. \"Be quiet! You are becoming\nwearisome. Gentlemen,\" he bowed slightly toward LeFleur and Creighton,\n\"one cannot fight bad luck, and this time Fate smiles upon you. It was a\ngood idea if it had worked,\" he added musingly. \"Young Ralestone seems\nto have gathered all the aces into his hand. Even,\" the drawl became a\nsneer, \"even the guardianship of the missing heir, which will mean a\nnice sum in the bank for the happy guardian, if all reports are true.\"\n\n\"What _did_ you want here?\" Val asked for the last time.\n\nThe Boss smiled. \"I shall leave that mystery for you to unravel, my\nwounded hero. It should occupy an idle moment or two. Doubtless all will\nbe made clear in the fullness of time. As for you,\" he turned upon\nLeFleur, \"there is no use in your entertaining any foolish idea of\ncalling the police. For our invasion today we have a court order;\nunhappily it is no longer of use. But we did come here in good faith, as\nwe are prepared to prove. And all other evidence of any lawbreaking upon\nour part rests, I believe, upon the word of two boys, evidence which\nmight be twisted by a clever lawyer. You may prosecute Simpson for\nperjury, of course. But I think that Simpson will not be in this part of\nthe country long. Yes,\" he looked about him once more at garden and\nhouse, \"it was a very good idea. A pity it did not work. Well, I must be\ngoing before I begin to curse my luck. When a man does that, he\nsometimes loses it. You must have found yours, I think.\"\n\n\"We did,\" Val answered, but the Boss did not hear him, for he had turned\non his heel and was striding down the terrace. For a moment his\nfollowers hesitated uncertainly and then they were after him. Back into\ntheir sinister beetle-car went the invaders and then they were gone down\nthe drive, leaving the Ralestones in possession of the victorious field.\n\n\"Now,\" Val said plaintively, \"will somebody please tell me just what\nthis is all about? Who is Jeems, really?\"\n\n\"Just who I said,\" answered Creighton promptly. \"Roderick St. Jean\nRalestone, the only descendant of your pirate ancestor.\"\n\n\"Bettah tell us the story,\" suggested the swamper quietly. \"Yo' ain't\nfoolin', are yo', Mistuh Creighton?\"\n\nThe New Yorker shook his head. \"No, I'm not fooling. But you are not the\nfirst one to question my story.\" He smiled reminiscently. \"Judge Henry\nLane had to see every line of written proof this morning before he would\nadmit that the tale might be true.\"\n\n\"But where did you find this 'proof'?\" Val demanded as Jeems pulled up\nchairs for the lawyer and Creighton.\n\n\"In that chest of Jeems' which you brought out of the swamp on the night\nof the storm,\" he replied promptly. \"And, young man,\" he said to Jeems\nindignantly, \"if you had let me see those papers of yours a month ago,\ninstead of waiting until last week, we would have had this matter\ncleared up then--\"\n\n\"But then we might never have found the Luck!\" Val protested.\n\n\"Humph, that piece of steel is historically interesting, no doubt,\"\nconceded Creighton, \"but hardly worth risking your life for.\"\n\n\"No? Well, you heard what that man said just now--that we had found our\nluck. It's so; we have had good luck since. But I'm sorry; do get on\nwith the story of Jeems' box.\"\n\n\"Ah gave it to him Monday,\" said the swamper slowly. \"But, Mistuh\nCreighton, there weren't nothin' in that chest but some books full of\nhandwritin'--most in some funny foreign stuff--an' a French\nprayer-book.\"\n\n\"Plenty to establish your right to the name and a quarter interest in\nthe estate,\" snapped LeFleur. Val thought the lawyer rather resented the\nfact that it was Creighton and not he who had found the way out of their\ndifficulties.\n\n\"Two of those books were ships' logs, kept in the fashion of diaries,\npartly in Latin,\" explained the New Yorker. \"The log of the ship\n_Annette Marie_ for the years 1814 and 1815 gave us what we wanted. The\nmaster was Captain Roderick Ralestone, although he concealed his name in\na sort of an anagram. After his quarrel with his brother he apparently\nwent to Lafitte and purchased the ship which he had once commanded for\nthe smuggler. Then he sailed off into the Gulf to become a free-trader,\nwith his headquarters first in Georgetown, British Guiana, then in Dutch\nCura\u00e7ao, and finally at Port-au-Prince, Haiti. It was there that he met\nand fell in love with Valerie St. Jean de Roche, the only living child\nand heir of the Comte de Roche, who had survived the Terror of the\nFrench Revolution only to fall victim to the rebel slaves on his Haitian\nestates.\n\n\"Horribly injured, the Comte de Roche had been saved from death by the\ndevotion of his daughter and her nurse, a free woman of color. These two\nwomen not only saved his life, but managed to keep him and themselves\nalive through the dark years which followed the horrors of the black\nuprising and the overthrow of the French rule. The courage of that lady\nof France must have been very great. But she was near to the end of her\nstrength when she met Roderick Ralestone.\n\n\"Against the direct orders of the black despots in the land, young\nRalestone got de Roche and his daughter away on his ship. Her maid chose\nto remain among her people. Ralestone hints that she was a sort of\npriestess of Voodoo and that it had been her dark powers which had\nprotected the lives of those she loved.\n\n\"Ralestone took the refugees to Cura\u00e7ao, but de Roche did not survive.\nHe lived only long enough to see his daughter married to her rescuer and\nto persuade his son-in-law to legally adopt the name of St. Jean de\nRoche, that an old and honored family might not be forgotten. The\nComte's only son had been killed by the blacks.\n\n\"So it was as Roderick St. Jean--he dropped the 'de Roche' in time--that\nhe returned here in 1830. His wife was dead, worn out while yet in her\nyouth by the horrors of her girlhood. But Roderick brought with him a\nten-year-old boy who had the right to both the name of Ralestone and\nthat of de Roche.\n\n\"Roderick himself was greatly changed. Years of free-trading, both in\nthe Gulf and in the South Seas, had made him wholly sailor. A cutlass\ncut disfigured his face and altered the line of his mouth. Anyone who\nhad known Roderick Ralestone would have little interest in Captain St.\nJean, the merchant adventurer. He discusses this point at some length in\nhis log, always concealing his real name.\n\n\"For the space of a year or two he was content to live quietly. He even\nopened a small shop and dealt in luxuries from the south. Then the\ndesire to wander, which must have been the key-note of his life, drove\nhim out into the world again. He placed his son in the care of a certain\npriest, whom he trusted, and went south to become one of the visionary\nrevolutionists who were fighting their way back and across South and\nCentral America. In one bloody engagement he fell, as his son notes in\nthe old logs which he was now using to record his own daily\nexperiences.\"\n\n\"Ricky said,\" Val mused, \"that Roderick Ralestone never died in his bed.\nWhat became of the son?\"\n\n\"Father Justinian wanted him to enter the Church, but in spite of his\nstrict training he had no vocation. The money his father had left with\nthe priest was enough to establish him in a small coastwise trading\nventure, and later he developed a flatboat freight service running\nupriver to Nashville.\"\n\n\"But didn't he ever try to get in touch with the Ralestones?\" Val asked.\n\n\"No. When Roderick Ralestone sailed from New Orleans he seems to have\ndetermined to cut himself off from the past entirely. As I said, he used\nan anagram to hide his name all the way through the log, and doubtless\nhis son never knew that there was anything strange about his father's\npast. Laurent St. Jean, the son, prospered. Just before the outbreak of\nthe Civil War he was reckoned one of the ten wealthiest men of his\nnative city.\n\n\"But that wealth vanished in the war when shipping no longer went forth\nfrom the port. I did come across one interesting fact in Laurent's notes\ncovering those years. In 1861 Laurent St. Jean built a blockade-runner\ncalled the _Red Bird_. His backer in the venture was a Mr. Ralestone of\nPirate's Haven. So once Ralestone did meet Ralestone without being aware\nof the fact.\n\n\"Laurent St. Jean was imprisoned by 'Beast' Butler, along with other\nprominent men of the city, when the Yankees captured New Orleans. And he\ndied in 1867 from a lingering illness contracted during his\nimprisonment. His son, Ren\u00e9 St. Jean, came home from war to find himself\nruined. His father's shipping business existed on paper only. Having the\ngrit and determination of his grandfather, he struggled along for almost\nten years trying to get back on his feet. But those were dark years for\nthe whole country.\n\n\"In 1876 St. Jean gave up the struggle. With his Creole wife and their\ntwo sons he moved into the swamps. Working first as a guide and trapper\nand then as a hunter of birds, he managed to make a sparse living. His\neldest son followed in his footsteps, but the younger took to the sea.\nRoderick St. Jean, the eldest son, died of yellow fever in 1890. He left\none son to the guardianship of his brother who had come home from the\nsea. That son came to look upon his uncle as his father and the real\nrelationship between them was half forgotten.\n\n\"But Ren\u00e9 St. Jean the second was curious. He knew something of the\nworld and he was interested in the past. It was his custom to do a great\namount of reading, especially reading which concerned the history of his\nown state and city. And once he was inclined to get out the old sea\nchest which had been moved with the family for so many years. Then he\nmust have discovered his relationship to the Ralestones; perhaps he\nsolved the anagram or found the pasted pages in the prayer-book--\n\n\"He was not ambitious for himself, but he wanted a better chance for his\nfoster-son and nephew than the one he had had. So he endeavored to prove\nhis claim to this property. Unfortunately, the lawyer he trusted was a\nshyster of the worst sort. He himself had no belief in his client's\nstory and merely bled him for small sums each month without ever really\nlooking into the matter.\"\n\n\"Gran'pappy said he was tryin' to git his rights,\" broke in Jeems. \"He\nnevah tol' mah pappy what he knowed. An' he wouldn't let anyone see into\nthat chest--he kep' it undah his bed. Then aftah Pappy died of the\nfever--'long with mah mothah--Gran'pappy cotched it too. An' the doctah\nsaid that was what made him so fo'getful aftahwards. He stopped goin' in\ntown; but he came heah--'huntin' his rights,' he said. An' he tol' me\nthat our fortune was hidden heah. 'Course,\" Jeems looked at them\napologetically, \"it soun's sorta silly, but when Gran'pappy tol' yo'\nthings yo' kinda believed 'em. So aftah he died Ah usta come huntin'\nheah too. An' then when Ah opened the chest and foun' these--\" From his\nbreast pocket he drew a wash-leather bag and opened it.\n\nHe held out to Val a chain of gold mesh ending in a carnelian carved\ninto a seal. \"This is youah crest,\" he pointed to the seal. \"Ah took it\nin town an' a man at the museum tol' me about it. An' this heah is\nRalestone, too,\" he indicated a small miniature painted on a slip of\nyellowed ivory. Val was looking at the face of the Ralestone rebel, as\nnear like the water-color copy Charity had made of the museum portrait\nas one pea is to its pod-mate. Creighton took up the small painting.\n\n\"Hm-m,\" he looked from the ivory to Jeems and then to Val, \"this is the\nfinal proof. Either one of you might have sat for this. You have the\nsame coloring and features. If it were not for a slight difference of\nexpression you might pass for twins. At any rate, there is no denying\nthat you are both Ralestones.\"\n\n\"I don't think that we'll ever attempt to deny it,\" Val laughed. \"But\nyou were right, Jeems--I mean Roderick,\" he said to his newly discovered\ncousin, \"you do have as much right here as we do.\"\n\nJeems colored. \"Ah'm sorry for sayin' that,\" he confessed. \"Ah thought\nyo' were right smart and too good for us. An' Ah'm sorry Ah played\nha'nt. But Ah didn't expec' yo' would evah see me, only the niggahs, an'\nI didn't care 'bout them. Ah always came when yo' were 'way or in bed.\"\n\n\"Well, you've explained your interest in the place,\" Val assented, \"but\nwhat about the rival? Why did he appear?\"\n\n\"It started in a blackmail plot. Your family have been wealthy, you\nknow,\" explained LeFleur. \"But then the scheme became more serious when\nthe oil prospectors aroused interest in the swamp. Already several men\nwhose property bounds yours have been approached by the Central American\nOil Company with an offer for their land. It would not at all surprise\nme if you were asked to dispose of your swamp wasteland for a good\nprice. And the rumor of oil is what made the rival, as you call him, try\nto press his false claim instead of merely holding it over you as a\nthreat.\"\n\n\"The Luck is certainly doing its stuff,\" Val observed. \"Here's the lost\nheir found, oil-wells bubbling at our back door--\"\n\n\"I would hardly say that, Mr. Valerius,\" remonstrated LeFleur.\n\n\"They may bubble yet,\" the boy assured him airily. \"I wouldn't put it\nbeyond the power of that length of Damascus steel to make wells bubble.\nOil-wells bubbling,\" Val continued from the point where the lawyer had\ninterrupted him, \"Rupert turning out to be the missing author--\"\n\n\"What was that?\" demanded Creighton sharply. He was on the point of\nhanding a small book to Jeems.\n\n\"We just discovered that Rupert is your missing author,\" Val explained.\n\"Didn't you guess when you heard the story of the missing Ralestone? The\nfamily went into town to tell you all about it; that's why we were alone\nwhen the invaders arrived.\"\n\n\"Mr. Ralestone my missing author! No, I didn't guess. I was too\ninterested in the story--but I should have! How stupid!\" He looked down\nat the book he still held and then put it into the swamper's hand.\n\"Between the pages of the prayer-book, covering the offices for St.\nLouis' Day, you'll find the birth certificate for Laurent St. Jean with\nhis right name,\" he said. \"That's a very important paper to keep, young\nman. Mr. Ralestone my author.\" He wiped his forehead with the\nhandkerchief from his breast-pocket. \"How stupid of me not to have seen\nat once. But why--\"\n\n\"He had some idea that his stuff was no good when he didn't hear from\nthat agent,\" Val explained, \"so he just tried to forget the whole\nmatter.\"\n\n\"But I have to see him, I have to see him at once.\" The New Yorker\nlooked about him as if by will-power alone he could summon Rupert to\nstand before him on the terrace.\n\n\"Stay to supper and you will,\" Val invited. \"Ricky and I discovered him\nfor you just as we promised we would. But then you've given us Rod in\nreturn. I am not,\" Val told his cousin, \"going to call you Rick even\nthough there is a tradition for it. There are too many 'Ricks'\ncomplicating the family history now. I think you had better be 'Rod'.\"\n\n\"Anythin' yo' say,\" he grinned.\n\nFor the third time that afternoon Val heard a car coming up the drive.\n\n\"If this should turn out to be the Grand Chan of Tartary or the Lama of\nPeru I shall not be one iota surprised,\" he announced. \"After what I've\nbeen through this afternoon, nothing, absolutely nothing, would surprise\nme. Oh, it's only the family.\"\n\nWith the impatience of one who has a good earth-shaking shock ready to\nadminister, he watched his wandering relatives disembark. Charity and\nHolmes were still with them and a sort of aura of disappointment hung\nover the group. Then Ricky looked up and with a cry of joy came up the\nterrace steps in what seemed like a single leap.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Creighton,\" she began when Val lifted his hand. \"Let me tell\nit,\" he begged, \"I've been waiting for a chance like this for years.\"\nRicky was obediently silent, thinking that he wished to break the\nmystery of the author. But Jeems and LeFleur understood that it was to\nthem Val appealed.\n\n\"Val, what are you doing out of bed?\" was Rupert's first question.\n\n\"Saving the old homestead while you went joy-riding. We had visitors\nthis afternoon.\"\n\n\"Visitors? Who?\" he began when his brother silenced him with a frown.\n\n\"Oh, let's not go into that now,\" Val said hurriedly. \"There is\nsomething more important to be discussed. Since you left this afternoon\nwe have had an addition to the family.\"\n\n\"An addition to the family,\" puzzled Ricky. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Rick Ralestone has come back,\" Val announced.\n\n\"Val, hadn't you better go back to bed?\" suggested his sister.\n\n\"Not now,\" he grinned at her. \"I haven't lost my mind yet, nor am I\nraving. Ladies and gentlemen,\" Val prepared to echo Creighton's speech\nof an hour before, \"permit me to introduce Roderick St. Jean de Roche\nRalestone, the missing heir!\"\n\nWith an impish grin Val had never seen on his face before, Jeems clicked\nhis heels in a creditable imitation of a court bow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nRUPERT BRINGS HOME HIS MARCHIONESS\n\n\n\"Such a nice domestic scene,\" Val observed.\n\nRicky looked up from the bowl into which she was shelling peas. \"Now\njust what do you mean by that?\" she asked suspiciously.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing at all. It's getting so I can't say a word around here\nwithout you suspecting some sort of a catch in it,\" her brother\ncomplained. He shifted the drawing-board Rod had fixed up for him an\ninch or two. Although Val's arm was at last out of the sling, he was not\nsupposed to use it unless absolutely necessary.\n\n\"Well, after that afternoon when you made the missing heir appear like a\nrabbit out of a hat--\" began his sister.\n\n\"Rod,\" Val called down to where their cousin was busied over the\nstretching of the new badminton net, \"did you hear that? She referred to\nyou as a rabbit--deliberately.\"\n\n\"Hm-m,\" Rod answered in absent-minded fashion. \"That cat of Miss\nCharity's just walked away with one of those feathered things yo' bat\n'round.\"\n\n\"Let us hope that he returns it in time,\" Val said; \"otherwise I can\nprophesy that you are going to spend the rest of the morning crawling\naround under hedges and things hunting for him and it. Ricky will not be\nbalked. If she says that we are going to play badminton--well, we are\ngoing to play badminton.\"\n\n\"I think that you might help too.\" Ricky attacked a fresh pod viciously\nas their cousin came up on the terrace. He stopped for a moment by\nRicky's chair, long enough to gather the pods together on the paper she\nhad put down for them, piling them up in a more orderly fashion than she\nwas capable of.\n\n\"Doing what?\" Val inquired. \"You know that Lucy has chased everyone out\nof the house. And now that Rod has finished setting out the lawn sports,\nwhat is there left to do? By the way, did Sam mend that croquet mallet,\nthe one with the loose head?\"\n\n\"The one that you broke hitting the stone with when you aimed at your\nball yesterday?\" she asked sweetly. \"Yes, I saw to that this morning.\"\n\n\"Then what more is there to worry about? Let the party begin.\" Val\nreached for his box of pencils.\n\nThat afternoon promptly at three-thirty the Ralestones of Pirate's Haven\nwere going to give their first party. They had lived, eaten, and slept\nwith the idea of a party for the past week until Rupert rebelled and\ndisappeared for the morning, taking Charity with him. He declared before\nhe left that the house was no longer habitable for anyone above the\nmental level of a party-mad monomaniac, a statement with which Val\nprivately agreed. But Ricky did trap him before he got the roadster out\nand made him promise to bring home two pounds of salted nuts and some\nmore ice, because she simply knew that they wouldn't have enough.\n\nRicky dropped the last of the peas into the bowl and leaned back in her\ncanvas deck-chair. \"I'm going to wear green,\" she murmured dreamily,\n\"with that leaf thing in my hair. And Charity's going to wear her rose,\nthe one that swishes when she walks.\"\n\n\"I think I'll appear in saffron,\" Val announced firmly. \"Somehow I feel\nlike saffron. How about you, Rod?\"\n\nThe thin, efficient, brown-faced person who was Roderick St. Jean de\nRoche Ralestone, to grant him his full name, stretched lazily and\ntransferred a fistful of Ricky's peas to his mouth, a mouth which was no\nlonger sullen. At Val's question he raised his shoulders in one of his\nFrench shrugs and considered.\n\n\"Yellow, with lilies behind mah ears,\" he grinned at Ricky. \"Bettah give\nthem somethin' to stare at; they'll all be powerful interested, anyway.\"\n\n\"Yes, the lost viscount,\" Val agreed. \"Of course, you're really only a\nLord like me, but it sounds better to say 'the lost viscount.' You'll\nshare the limelight with Rupert and the Luck, so you'd better take that\npair of my flannels which haven't turned quite yellow yet.\"\n\nRod shook his head. \"This time Ah have mah own. Ah went in town shoppin'\nyesterday. It's mah turn to share clothes. Youah brothah told me to get\nyo' some shirts. So Ah did. Lucy put them in the top drawer.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me,\" Val begged, aroused by this news, \"that we are actually\nable to afford some new clothes again?\"\n\nRod nodded and Ricky sat up. \"Don't be silly,\" she said, \"we're\ncomfortably well off. With Rupert writing books, and a lot of oil or\nsomething in the swamp, why, what have we got to worry about? And next\nfall Rod's going to college and I'm taking that course in dress\ndesigning and Rupert's going to write another book and--and--\" Her\ninventive powers failed as Holmes came out on the terrace.\n\n\"Hello there.\" Val glanced at his watch. \"I don't want to seem\ninhospitable, but you're about four hours too early. We haven't even\ncrawled into our party duds.\"\n\n\"So I see. But this isn't a social call. By the way, where's Charity?\"\n\n\"Oh, she went off with Rupert this morning,\" answered Ricky. \"And I\nthink it was mean of them, running out on us that way, when there was so\nmuch to do.\"\n\nIt seemed to Val that there was a faint shadow of irritation across the\nopen good nature of Holmes' smile when he heard her answer. \"That damsel\nis becoming very elusive nowadays,\" he observed as he sat down. \"But now\nfor business.\"\n\n\"More business? Not another oil-well!\" Ricky expressed her surprise\nvividly with upflung hands.\n\n\"Not an oil-well, no. Just this--\" He pulled Val's black note-book from\nhis pocket. \"Now I am not going to tell you that I have shown them to a\npublisher and that he wants fifty thousand or so at five dollars apiece.\nBut I did show them to that friend I spoke of. He isn't very well known\nat present but he will be some day. His name is Fenly Moss and he is\ninterested in animated cartoons. He has some ideas that sound rather big\nto me.\n\n\"Fen says that these animal drawings of yours show promise and he wants\nto know whether you ever thought of trying something along his line?\"\n\nVal shook his head, impatient to hear the rest.\n\n\"Well, he's in town right now on his vacation and he's coming out to see\nyou tomorrow. I advise you, Ralestone, that if Fen makes you the\nproposition I think he's going to, to grab it. It'll mean hard work for\nyou and plenty of it, but there is a future to it.\"\n\n\"I don't know how to thank you,\" the boy began when Holmes frowned at\nhim half-seriously. \"None of that. I was really doing Fen a favor, but\nyou needn't tell him that. Do you know how long Charity and your brother\nare going to be gone?\"\n\n\"No. But they'll be back for lunch,\" Ricky said. \"If they remember\nlunch--they're getting so vague lately. Val went out to call them to\ndinner last night and it took him a good five minutes to get them out of\nthe garden.\"\n\n\"Five? Nearer ten,\" scoffed her brother.\n\nHolmes got up abruptly. \"Well, I'll be drifting. When is this binge of\nyours?\"\n\n\"Three-thirty, which really means four,\" answered Ricky. \"Aren't you\ngoing to stay to lunch?\"\n\nThe New Yorker shook his head. \"Sorry, I've another engagement. Thanks\njust the same.\"\n\n\"Thank _you_!\" Val waved the note-book as he vanished. \"Wonder why he\nhurried off that way?\"\n\n\"Mad to think that Miss Charity was gone,\" answered Rod shrewdly. \"Yo've\nhad that board long enough.\" He calmly possessed himself of Val's\ndrawing equipment. \"Time to rest.\"\n\n\"Yes, grandfather,\" his cousin assented meekly.\n\nRicky slapped at a fly. \"It seems to get hotter and hotter,\" she said.\nFrom the breast pocket of her sport dress she produced a handkerchief\nand mopped her face. Then she looked at the handkerchief in surprise.\n\n\"What's the matter? Some face come off along with the paint?\" asked Val.\n\n\"No. But I just remembered what this is--our clue!\"\n\n\"You mean the handkerchief we found in the hall? I wonder who--\"\n\nRod reached up and took it out of her hand.\n\n\"Mine. Miss Charity gave me a dozen last Christmas.\"\n\n\"Then you left it there,\" Ricky laughed. \"Well, that solves the last of\nour mysteries.\"\n\n\"All present or accounted for,\" Val agreed as around the house came\nRupert and their tenant.\n\n\"So there you are,\" began Ricky. \"And I'd like to know what you've been\ndoing all morning--\"\n\n\"Would you really?\" asked Rupert.\n\nRicky stared at him for a long moment and then she arose before\ntransferring her gaze to Charity. It might have been sunburn or the heat\nRicky had complained of which colored the cheeks of the Boston Biglow.\n\n\"Rod! Val!\" cried Ricky. \"Where are your manners?\" As she sank forward\nin a deep and graceful curtsy she added, \"Can't you see that Rupert has\nbrought home his Marchioness?\"\n\n\"Now that,\" said Val, as he held out his hand to the new mistress of\nPirate's Haven, \"is what I call 'Ralestone Luck.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Ralestone Luck, by Andre Norton\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK RALESTONE LUCK ***\n\n***** This file should be named 18817-8.txt or 18817-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/8/8/1/18817/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Jason Isbell, Mary Meehan and the\nOnline Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
