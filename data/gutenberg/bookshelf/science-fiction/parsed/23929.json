For\ntwenty of these years the author of this story has vaguely wondered what\nwould replace the collapsed Soviet system. A return to Czarism? Oh, come\nnow! Capitalism as we know it today in the advanced Western countries?\nIt would seem difficult after almost half a century of State ownership\nand control of the means of production, distribution, communications,\neducation, science. Then what? The question became increasingly\ninteresting following recent visits not only to Moscow and Leningrad but\nalso to various other capital cities of the Soviet complex. A\ncontroversial subject? Indeed it is. You can't get much more\ncontroversial than this in the world today. But this is science fiction,\nand here we go._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPaul Koslov nodded briefly once or twice as he made his way through the\nforest of desks. Behind him he caught snatches of tittering voices in\nwhisper.\n\n\"... That's him ... The Chief's hatchetman ... Know what they call him\nin Central America, a _pistola_, that means ... About Iraq ... And that\ntime in Egypt ... Did you notice his eyes ... How would you like to date\n_him_ ... That's him. I was at a cocktail party once when he was there.\nShivery ... cold-blooded--\"\n\nPaul Koslov grinned inwardly. He hadn't asked for the reputation but it\nisn't everyone who is a legend before thirty-five. What was it\n_Newsweek_ had called him? \"The T. E. Lawrence of the Cold War.\" The\ntrouble was it wasn't something you could turn off. It had its\nshortcomings when you found time for some personal life.\n\nHe reached the Chief's office, rapped with a knuckle and pushed his way\nthrough.\n\nThe Chief and a male secretary, who was taking dictation, looked up. The\nsecretary frowned, evidently taken aback by the cavalier entrance, but\nthe Chief said, \"Hello, Paul, come on in. Didn't expect you quite so\nsoon.\" And to the secretary, \"Dickens, that's all.\"\n\nWhen Dickens was gone the Chief scowled at his trouble-shooter. \"Paul,\nyou're bad for discipline around here. Can't you even knock before you\nenter? How is Nicaragua?\"\n\nPaul Koslov slumped into a leather easy-chair and scowled. \"I did knock.\nMost of it's in my report. Nicaragua is ... tranquil. It'll stay\ntranquil for a while, too. There isn't so much as a parlor pink--\"\n\n\"And Lopez--?\"\n\nPaul said slowly, \"Last time I saw Raul was in a swamp near Lake\nManagua. The very last time.\"\n\nThe Chief said hurriedly, \"Don't give me the details. I leave details up\nto you.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Paul said flatly.\n\nHis superior drew a pound can of Sir Walter Raleigh across the desk,\nselected a briar from a pipe rack and while he was packing in tobacco\nsaid, \"Paul, do you know what day it is--and what year?\"\n\n\"It's Tuesday. And 1965.\"\n\nThe bureau chief looked at his disk calendar. \"Um-m-m. Today the Seven\nYear Plan is completed.\"\n\nPaul snorted.\n\nThe Chief said mildly, \"Successfully. For all practical purposes, the\nU.S.S.R. has surpassed us in gross national product.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"That's not the way I understand it.\"\n\n\"Then you make the mistake of believing our propaganda. That's always a\nmistake, believing your own propaganda. Worse than believing the other\nman's.\"\n\n\"Our steel capacity is a third again as much as theirs.\"\n\n\"Yes, and currently, what with our readjustment--remember when they used\nto call them _recessions_, or even earlier, _depressions_--our steel\nindustry is operating at less than sixty per cent of capacity. The\nSoviets always operate at one hundred per cent of capacity. They don't\nhave to worry about whether or not they can sell it. If they produce\nmore steel than they immediately need, they use it to build another\nsteel mill.\"\n\nThe Chief shook his head. \"As long ago as 1958 they began passing us,\nproduct by product. Grain, butter, and timber production, jet aircraft,\nspace flight, and coal--\"\n\nPaul leaned forward impatiently. \"We put out more than three times as\nmany cars, refrigerators, kitchen stoves, washing machines.\"\n\nHis superior said, \"That's the point. While we were putting the product\nof our steel mills into automobiles and automatic kitchen equipment,\nthey did without these things and put their steel into more steel mills,\nmore railroads, more factories. We leaned back and took it easy, sneered\nat their progress, talked a lot about our freedom and liberty to our\nallies and the neutrals and enjoyed our refrigerators and washing\nmachines until they finally passed us.\"\n\n\"You sound like a Tass broadcast from Moscow.\"\n\n\"Um-m-m, I've been trying to,\" the Chief said. \"However, that's still\nroughly the situation. The fact that you and I personally, and a couple\nof hundred million Americans, prefer our cars and such to more steel\nmills, and prefer our personal freedoms and liberties is beside the\npoint. We should have done less laughing seven years ago and more\nthinking about today. As things stand, give them a few more years at\nthis pace and every neutral nation in the world is going to fall into\ntheir laps.\"\n\n\"That's putting it strong, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Strong?\" the Chief growled disgustedly. \"That's putting it mildly. Even\nsome of our allies are beginning to waver. Eight years ago, India and\nChina both set out to industrialize themselves. Today, China is the\nthird industrial power of the world. Where's India, about twentieth? Ten\nyears from now China will probably be first. I don't even allow myself\nto think where she'll be twenty-five years from now.\"\n\n\"The Indians were a bunch of idealistic screwballs.\"\n\n\"That's one of the favorite alibis, isn't it? Actually we, the West, let\nthem down. They couldn't get underway. The Soviets backed China with\neverything they could toss in.\"\n\nPaul crossed his legs and leaned back. \"It seems to me I've run into\nthis discussion a few hundred times at cocktail parties.\"\n\nThe Chief pulled out a drawer and brought forth a king-size box of\nkitchen matches. He struck one with a thumbnail and peered through\ntobacco smoke at Paul Koslov as he lit up.\n\n\"The point is that the system the Russkies used when they started their\nfirst five-year plan back in 1928, and the system used in China, works.\nIf we, with our traditions of freedom and liberty, like it or not, it\nworks. Every citizen of the country is thrown into the grinding mill to\nincrease production. Everybody,\" the Chief grinned sourly, \"that is,\nexcept the party elite, who are running the whole thing. Everybody\nsacrifices for the sake of the progress of the whole country.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Paul said. \"Give me enough time and I'll find out what this\nlecture is all about.\"\n\nThe Chief grunted at him. \"The Commies are still in power. If they\nremain in power and continue to develop the way they're going, we'll be\nthrough, completely through, in another few years. We'll be so far\nbehind we'll be the world's laughing-stock--and everybody else will be\non the Soviet bandwagon.\"\n\nHe seemed to switch subjects. \"Ever hear of Somerset Maugham?\"\n\n\"Sure. I've read several of his novels.\"\n\n\"I was thinking of Maugham the British Agent, rather than Maugham the\nnovelist, but it's the same man.\"\n\n\"British agent?\"\n\n\"Um-m-m. He was sent to Petrograd in 1917 to prevent the Bolshevik\nrevolution. The Germans had sent Lenin and Zinoviev up from Switzerland,\nwhere they'd been in exile, by a sealed train in hopes of starting a\nrevolution in Czarist Russia. The point I'm leading to is that in one of\nhis books, 'The Summing Up,' I believe, Maugham mentions in passing that\nhad he got to Petrograd possibly six weeks earlier he thinks he could\nhave done his job successfully.\"\n\nPaul looked at him blankly. \"What could he have done?\"\n\nThe Chief shrugged. \"It was all out war. The British wanted to keep\nRussia in the allied ranks so as to divert as many German troops as\npossible from the Western front. The Germans wanted to eliminate the\nRussians. Maugham had carte blanche. Anything would have gone. Elements\nof the British fleet to fight the Bolsheviks, unlimited amounts of money\nfor anything he saw fit from bribery to hiring assassins. What would\nhave happened, for instance, if he could have had Lenin and Trotsky\nkilled?\"\n\nPaul said suddenly, \"What has all this got to do with me?\"\n\n\"We're giving you the job this time.\"\n\n\"Maugham's job?\" Paul didn't get it.\n\n\"No, the other one. I don't know who the German was who engineered\nsending Lenin up to Petrograd, but that's the equivalent of your job.\"\nHe seemed to go off on another bent. \"Did you read Djilas' 'The New\nClass' about a decade ago?\"\n\n\"Most of it, as I recall. One of Tito's top men who turned against the\nCommies and did quite a job of exposing the so-called classless\nsociety.\"\n\n\"That's right. I've always been surprised that so few people bothered to\nwonder how Djilas was able to smuggle his book out of one of Tito's\nstrongest prisons and get it to publishers in the West.\"\n\n\"Never thought of it,\" Paul agreed. \"How could he?\"\n\n\"Because,\" the Chief said, knocking the ash from his pipe and replacing\nit in the rack, \"there was and is a very strong underground in all the\nCommunist countries. Not only Yugoslavia, but the Soviet Union as well.\"\n\nPaul stirred impatiently. \"Once again, what's all this got to do with\nme?\"\n\n\"They're the ones you're going to work with. The anti-Soviet\nunderground. You've got unlimited leeway. Unlimited support to the\nextent we can get it to you. Unlimited funds for whatever you find you\nneed them for. Your job is to help the underground start a new Russian\nRevolution.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPaul Koslov, his face still bandaged following plastic surgery, spent a\ncouple of hours in the Rube Goldberg department inspecting the latest\ngadgets of his trade.\n\nDerek Stevens said, \"The Chief sent down a memo to introduce you to this\nnew item. We call it a Tracy.\"\n\nPaul frowned at the wristwatch, fingered it a moment, held it to his\near. It ticked and the second hand moved. \"Tracy?\" he said.\n\nStevens said, \"After Dick Tracy. Remember, a few years ago? His wrist\ntwo-way radio.\"\n\n\"But this is really a watch,\" Paul said.\n\n\"Sure. Keeps fairly good time, too. However, that's camouflage. It's\nalso a two-way radio. Tight beam from wherever you are to the Chief.\"\n\nPaul pursed his lips. \"The transistor boys are really doing it up\nbrown.\" He handed the watch back to Derek Stevens. \"Show me how it\nworks, Derek.\"\n\nThey spent fifteen minutes on the communications device, then Derek\nStevens said, \"Here's another item the Chief thought you might want to\nsee:\"\n\nIt was a compact, short-muzzled hand gun. Paul handled it with the ease\nof long practice. \"The grip's clumsy. What's its advantage? I don't\nparticularly like an automatic.\"\n\nDerek Stevens motioned with his head. \"Come into the firing range,\nKoslov, and we'll give you a demonstration.\"\n\nPaul shot him a glance from the side of his eyes, then nodded. \"Lead\non.\"\n\nIn the range, Stevens had a man-size silhouette put up. He stood to one\nside and said, \"O.K., let her go.\"\n\nPaul stood easily, left hand in pants pocket, brought the gun up and\ntightened on the trigger. He frowned and pressed again.\n\nHe scowled at Derek Stevens. \"It's not loaded.\"\n\nStevens grunted amusement. \"Look at the target. First time you got it\nright over the heart.\"\n\n\"I'll be ...,\" Paul began. He looked down at the weapon in surprise.\n\"Noiseless and recoilless. What caliber is it, Derek, and what's the\nmuzzle velocity?\"\n\n\"We call it the .38 Noiseless,\" Stevens said. \"It has the punch of that\n.44 Magnum you're presently carrying.\"\n\nWith a fluid motion Paul Koslov produced the .44 Magnum from the holster\nunder his left shoulder and tossed it to one side. \"That's the last time\nI tote that cannon,\" he said. He balanced the new gun in his hand in\nadmiration. \"Have the front sight taken off for me, Derek, and the fore\npart of the trigger guard. I need a quick draw gun.\" He added absently,\n\"How did you know I carried a .44?\"\n\nStevens said, \"You're rather famous, Koslov. The Colonel Lawrence of the\nCold War. The journalists are kept from getting very much about you, but\nwhat they do learn they spread around.\"\n\nPaul Koslov said flatly, \"Why don't you like me, Stevens? In this game I\ndon't appreciate people on our team who don't like me. It's dangerous.\"\n\nDerek Stevens flushed. \"I didn't say I didn't like you.\"\n\n\"You didn't have to.\"\n\n\"It's nothing personal,\" Stevens said.\n\nPaul Koslov looked at him.\n\nStevens said, \"I don't approve of Americans committing political\nassassinations.\"\n\nPaul Koslov grinned wolfishly and without humor. \"You'll have a hard\ntime proving that even our cloak and dagger department has ever\nauthorized assassination, Stevens. By the way, I'm not an American.\"\n\nDerek Stevens was not the type of man whose jaw dropped, but he blinked.\n\"Then what are you?\"\n\n\"A Russian,\" Paul snapped. \"And look, Stevens, we're busy now, but when\nyou've got some time to do a little thinking, consider the ethics of\nwarfare.\"\n\nStevens was flushed again at the tone. \"Ethics of warfare?\"\n\n\"There aren't any,\" Paul Koslov snapped. \"There hasn't been chivalry in\nwar for a long time, and there probably never will be again. Neither\nside can afford it. And I'm talking about cold war as well as hot.\" He\nscowled at the other. \"Or did you labor under the illusion that only the\nCommies had tough operators on their side?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPaul Koslov crossed the Atlantic in a supersonic TU-180 operated by\nEuropa Airways. That in itself galled him. It was bad enough that the\nCommies had stolen a march on the West with the first jet liner to go\ninto mass production, the TU-104 back in 1957. By the time the United\nStates brought out its first really practical trans-Atlantic jets in\n1959 the Russians had come up with the TU-114 which its designer, old\nAndrei Tupolev named the largest, most efficient and economical\naircraft flying.\n\nIn civil aircraft they had got ahead and stayed ahead. Subsidized beyond\nanything the West could or at least would manage, the air lines of the\nworld couldn't afford to operate the slower, smaller and more expensive\nWestern models. One by one, first the neutrals such as India, and then\neven members of the Western bloc began equipping their air lines with\nRussian craft.\n\nPaul grunted his disgust at the memory of the strong measures that had\nto be taken by the government to prevent even some of the American lines\nfrom buying Soviet craft at the unbelievably low prices they offered\nthem.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn London he presented a card on which he had added a numbered code in\npencil. Handed it over a desk to the British intelligence major.\n\n\"I believe I'm expected,\" Paul said.\n\nThe major looked at him, then down at the card. \"Just a moment, Mr.\nSmith. I'll see if his lordship is available. Won't you take a chair?\"\nHe left the room.\n\nPaul Koslov strolled over to the window and looked out on the moving\nlines of pedestrians below. He had first been in London some thirty\nyears ago. So far as he could remember, there were no noticeable changes\nwith the exception of automobile design. He wondered vaguely how long it\ntook to make a noticeable change in the London street scene.\n\nThe major re-entered the room with a new expression of respect on his\nface. \"His lordship will see you immediately, Mr. Smith.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Paul said. He entered the inner office.\n\nLord Carrol was attired in civilian clothes which somehow failed to\ndisguise a military quality in his appearance. He indicated a chair next\nto his desk. \"We've been instructed to give you every assistance Mr. ...\nSmith. Frankly, I can't imagine of just what this could consist.\"\n\nPaul said, as he adjusted himself in the chair, \"I'm going into the\nSoviet Union on an important assignment. I'll need as large a team at my\ndisposal as we can manage. You have agents in Russia, of course?\" He\nlifted his eyebrows.\n\nHis lordship cleared his throat and his voice went even stiffer. \"All\nmajor military nations have a certain number of espionage operatives in\neach other's countries. No matter how peaceful the times, this is\nstandard procedure.\"\n\n\"And these are hardly peaceful times,\" Paul said dryly. \"I'll want a\ncomplete list of your Soviet based agents and the necessary information\non how to contact them.\"\n\nLord Carrol stared at him. Finally sputtered, \"Man, _why_? You're not\neven a British national. This is--\"\n\nPaul, held up a hand. \"We're co-operating with the Russian underground.\nCo-operating isn't quite strong enough a word. We're going to _push_\nthem into activity if we can.\"\n\nThe British intelligence head looked down at the card before him. \"Mr.\nSmith,\" he read. He looked up. \"John Smith, I assume.\"\n\nPaul said, still dryly, \"Is there any other?\"\n\nLord Carrol said, \"See here, you're really Paul Koslov, aren't you?\"\n\nPaul looked at him, said nothing.\n\nLord Carrol said impatiently, \"What you ask is impossible. Our\noperatives all have their own assignments, their own work. Why do you\nneed them?\"\n\n\"This is the biggest job ever, overthrowing the Soviet State. We need as\nmany men as we can get on our team. Possibly I won't have to use them\nbut, if I do, I want them available.\"\n\nThe Britisher rapped, \"You keep mentioning _our team_ but according to\nthe dossier we carry on you, Mr. Koslov, you are neither British nor\neven a Yankee. And you ask me to turn over our complete Soviet\nmachinery.\"\n\nPaul came to his feet and leaned over the desk, there was a paleness\nimmediately beneath his ears and along his jaw line. \"Listen,\" he said\ntightly, \"if I'm not on this team, there just is no team. Just a\npretense of one. When there's a real team there has to be a certain\nspirit. A team spirit. I don't care if you're playing cricket, football\nor international cold war. If there's one thing that's important to me,\nthat I've based my whole life upon, it's this, understand? _I've_ got\nteam spirit. Perhaps no one else in the whole West has it, but _I_ do.\"\n\nInwardly, Lord Carrol was boiling. He snapped, \"You're neither British\nnor American. In other words, you are a mercenary. How do we know that\nthe Russians won't offer you double or triple what the Yankees pay for\nyour services?\"\n\nPaul sat down again and looked at his watch. \"My time is limited,\" he\nsaid. \"I have to leave for Paris this afternoon and be in Bonn tomorrow.\nI don't care what opinions you might have in regard to my mercenary\nmotives, Lord Carrol. I've just come from Downing Street. I suggest you\nmake a phone call there. At the request of Washington, your government\nhas given me carte blanche in this matter.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPaul flew into Moscow in an Aeroflot jet, landing at Vnukovo airport on\nthe outskirts of the city. He entered as an American businessman, a\ncamera importer who was also interested in doing a bit of tourist\nsightseeing. He was traveling deluxe category which entitled him to a\nZil complete with chauffeur and an interpreter-guide when he had need of\none. He was quartered in the Ukrayna, on Dorogomilovskaya Quai, a\ntwenty-eight floor skyscraper with a thousand rooms.\n\nIt was Paul's first visit to Moscow but he wasn't particularly thrown\noff. He kept up with developments and was aware of the fact that as\nearly as the late 1950s, the Russians had begun to lick the problems of\nample food, clothing and finally shelter. Even those products once\nconsidered sheer luxuries were now in abundant supply. If material\nthings alone had been all that counted, the Soviet man in the street\nwasn't doing so badly.\n\nHe spent the first several days getting the feel of the city and also\nmaking his preliminary business calls. He was interested in a new\n\"automated\" camera currently being touted by the Russians as the world's\nbest. Fastest lens, foolproof operation, guaranteed for the life of the\nowner, and retailing for exactly twenty-five dollars.\n\nHe was told, as expected, that the factory and distribution point was in\nLeningrad and given instructions and letters of introduction.\n\nOn the fifth day he took the Red Arrow Express to Leningrad and\nestablished himself at the Astoria Hotel, 39 Hertzen Street. It was one\nof the many of the Intourist hotels going back to before the revolution.\n\nHe spent the next day allowing his guide to show him the standard\ntourist sights. The Winter Palace, where the Bolshevik revolution was\nwon when the mutinied cruiser _Aurora_ steamed up the river and shelled\nit. The Hermitage Museum, rivaled only by the Vatican and Louvre. The\nAlexandrovskaya Column, the world's tallest monolithic stone monument.\nThe modest personal palace of Peter the Great. The Peter and Paul\nCathedral. The king-size Kirov Stadium. The Leningrad subway, as much a\nmuseum as a system of transportation.\n\nHe saw it all, tourist fashion, and wondered inwardly what the Intourist\nguide would have thought had he known that this was Mr. John Smith's\nhome town.\n\nThe day following, he turned his business problem over to the guide. He\nwanted to meet, let's see now, oh yes, here it is, Leonid Shvernik, of\nthe Mikoyan Camera works. Could it be arranged?\n\nOf course it could be arranged. The guide went into five minutes of\noratory on the desire of the Soviet Union to trade with the West, and\nthus spread everlasting peace.\n\nAn interview was arranged for Mr. Smith with Mr. Shvernik for that\nafternoon.\n\nMr. Smith met Mr. Shvernik in the latter's office at two and they went\nthrough the usual amenities. Mr. Shvernik spoke excellent English so Mr.\nSmith was able to dismiss his interpreter-guide for the afternoon. When\nhe was gone and they were alone Mr. Shvernik went into his sales talk.\n\n\"I can assure you, sir, that not since the Japanese startled the world\nwith their new cameras shortly after the Second War, has any such\nrevolution in design and quality taken place. The Mikoyan is not only\nthe _best_ camera produced anywhere, but since our plant is fully\nautomated, we can sell it for a fraction the cost of German, Japanese or\nAmerican--\"\n\nPaul Koslov came to his feet, walked quietly over to one of the pictures\nhanging on the wall, lifted it, pointed underneath and raised his\neyebrows at the other.\n\nLeonid Shvernik leaned back in his chair, shocked.\n\nPaul remained there until at last the other shook his head.\n\nPaul said, in English, \"Are you absolutely sure?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Shvernik said. \"There are no microphones in here. I absolutely\nknow. Who are you?\"\n\nPaul said, \"In the movement they call you Georgi, and you're top man in\nthe Leningrad area.\"\n\nShvernik's hand came up from under the desk and he pointed a heavy\nmilitary revolver at his visitor. \"Who are you?\" he repeated.\n\nPaul ignored the gun. \"Someone who knows that you are Georgi,\" he said\n\"I'm from America. Is there any chance of anybody intruding?\"\n\n\"Yes, one of my colleagues. Or perhaps a secretary.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Then I suggest we go to a bar, or some place, for a drink or a cup of\ncoffee or whatever the current Russian equivalent might be.\"\n\nShvernik looked at him searchingly. \"Yes,\" he said finally. \"There's a\nplace down the street.\" He began to stick the gun in his waistband,\nchanged his mind and put it back into the desk drawer.\n\nAs soon as they were on the open street and out of earshot of other\npedestrians, Paul said, \"Would you rather I spoke Russian? I have the\nfeeling that we'd draw less attention than if we speak English.\"\n\nShvernik said tightly, \"Do the Intourist people know you speak Russian?\nIf not, stick to English. Now, how do you know my name? I have no\ncontacts with the Americans.\"\n\n\"I got it through my West German contacts.\"\n\nThe Russian's face registered unsuppressed fury. \"Do they ignore the\nsimplest of precautions! Do they reveal me to every source that asks?\"\n\nPaul said mildly, \"Herr Ludwig is currently under my direction. Your\nsecret is as safe as it has ever been.\"\n\nThe underground leader remained silent for a long moment. \"You're an\nAmerican, eh, and Ludwig told you about me? What do you want now?\"\n\n\"To help,\" Paul Koslov said.\n\n\"How do you mean, to help? How can you help? I don't know what you're\ntalking about.\"\n\n\"Help in any way you want. Money, printing presses, mimeograph machines,\nradio transmitters, weapons, manpower in limited amounts, know-how,\ntraining, anything you need to help overthrow the Soviet government.\"\n\nThey had reached the restaurant. Leonid Shvernik became the Russian\nexport official. He ushered his customer to a secluded table. Saw him\ncomfortably into his chair.\n\n\"Do you actually know anything about cameras?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Paul said, \"we're thorough. I can buy cameras from you and\nthey'll be marketed in the States.\"\n\n\"Good.\" The waiter was approaching. Shvernik said, \"Have you ever eaten\ncaviar Russian style?\"\n\n\"I don't believe so,\" Paul said \"I'm not very hungry.\"\n\n\"Nothing to do with hunger.\" Shvernik said. From the waiter he ordered\nraisin bread, sweet butter, caviar and a carafe of vodka.\n\nThe waiter went off for it and Shvernik said, \"To what extent are you\nwilling to help us? Money, for instance. What kind of money, rubles,\ndollars? And how much? A revolutionary movement can always use money.\"\n\n\"Any kind,\" Paul said flatly, \"and any amount.\"\n\nShvernik was impressed. He said eagerly, \"Any amount within reason, eh?\"\n\nPaul looked into his face and said flatly, \"Any amount, period. It\ndoesn't have to be particularly reasonable. Our only qualification would\nbe a guarantee it is going into the attempt to overthrow the\nSoviets--not into private pockets.\"\n\nThe waiter was approaching. Shvernik drew some brochures from his\npocket, spread them before Paul Koslov and began to point out with a\nfountain pen various features of the Mikoyan camera.\n\nThe waiter put the order on the table and stood by for a moment for\nfurther orders.\n\nShvernik said, \"First you take a sizable portion of vodka, like this.\"\nHe poured them two jolts. \"And drink it down, ah, bottoms up, you\nAmericans say. Then you spread butter on a small slice of raisin bread,\nand cover it with a liberal portion of caviar. Good? Then you eat your\nlittle sandwich and drink another glass of vodka. Then you start all\nover again.\"\n\n\"I can see it could be fairly easy to get stoned, eating caviar Russian\nstyle,\" Paul laughed.\n\nThey went through the procedure and the waiter wandered off.\n\nPaul said, \"I can take several days arranging the camera deal with you.\nThen I can take a tour of the country, supposedly giving it a tourist\nlook-see, but actually making contact with more of your organization. I\ncan then return in the future, supposedly to make further orders. I can\nassure you, these cameras are going to sell very well in the States.\nI'll be coming back, time and again--for business reasons. Meanwhile, do\nyou have any members among the interpreter-guides in the local Intourist\noffices?\"\n\nShvernik nodded. \"Yes. And, yes, that would be a good idea. We'll assign\nAna Furtseva to you, if we can arrange it. And possibly she can even\nhave a chauffeur assigned you who'll also be one of our people.\"\n\nThat was the first time Paul Koslov heard the name Ana Furtseva.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the morning Leonid Shvernik came to the hotel in a Mikoyan Camera\nWorks car loaded with cameras and the various accessories that were\navailable for the basic model. He began gushing the advantages of the\nMikoyan before they were well out of the hotel.\n\nThe last thing he said, as they trailed out of the hotel's portals was,\n\"We'll drive about town, giving you an opportunity to do some snapshots\nand then possibly to my country dacha where we can have lunch--\"\n\nAt the car he said, \"May I introduce Ana Furtseva, who's been assigned\nas your guide-interpreter by Intourist for the balance of your stay?\nAna, Mr. John Smith.\"\n\nPaul shook hands.\n\nShe was blond as almost all Russian girls are blond, and with the\nstartling blue eyes. A touch chubby, by Western standards, but less so\nthan the Russian average. She had a disturbing pixie touch around the\nmouth, out of place in a dedicated revolutionist.\n\nThe car took off with Shvernik at the wheel. \"You're actually going to\nhave to take pictures as we go along. We'll have them developed later at\nthe plant. I've told them that you are potentially a very big order.\nPossibly they'll try and assign one of my superiors to your account\nafter a day or two. If so, I suggest that you merely insist that you\nfeel I am competent and you would rather continue with me.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Paul said. \"Now then, how quickly can our assistance to you\nget underway?\"\n\n\"The question is,\" Shvernik said, \"just how much you can do in the way\nof helping our movement. For instance, can you get advanced type weapons\nto us?\"\n\nThe .38 Noiseless slid easily into Paul's hands. \"Obviously, we can't\nsmuggle sizable military equipment across the border. But here, for\ninstance, is a noiseless, recoilless hand gun. We could deliver any\nreasonable amount within a month.\"\n\n\"Five thousand?\" Shvernik asked.\n\n\"I think so. You'd have to cover once they got across the border, of\ncourse. How well organized are you? If you aren't, possibly we can help\nthere, but not in time to get five thousand guns to you in a month.\"\n\nAna was puzzled. \"How could you possibly get that number across the\nSoviet borders?\" Her voice had a disturbing Slavic throatiness. It\noccurred to Paul Koslov that she was one of the most attractive women he\nhad ever met. He was amused. Women had never played a great part in his\nlife. There had never been anyone who had really, basically, appealed.\nBut evidently blood was telling. Here he had to come back to Russia to\nfind such attractiveness.\n\nHe said, \"The Yugoslavs are comparatively open and smuggling across the\nAdriatic from Italy, commonplace. We'd bring the things you want in that\nway. Yugoslavia and Poland are on good terms, currently, with lots of\ntrade. We'd ship them by rail from Yugoslavia to Warsaw. Trade between\nPoland and U.S.S.R. is on massive scale. Our agents in Warsaw would send\non the guns in well concealed shipments. Freight cars aren't searched at\nthe Polish-Russian border. However, your agents would have to pick up\nthe deliveries in Brest or Kobryn, before they got as far as Pinsk.\"\n\nAna said, her voice very low, \"Visiting in Sweden at the Soviet Embassy\nin Stockholm is a colonel who is at the head of the Leningrad branch of\nthe KGB department in charge of counter-revolution, as they call it. Can\nyou eliminate him?\"\n\n\"Is it necessary? Are you sure that if it's done it might not raise such\na stink that the KGB might concentrate more attention on you?\" Paul\ndidn't like this sort of thing. It seldom accomplished anything.\n\nAna said, \"He knows that both Georgi and I are members of the movement.\"\n\nPaul Koslov gaped at her. \"You mean your position is known to the\npolice?\"\n\nShvernik said, \"Thus far he has kept the information to himself. He\nfound out when Ana tried to enlist his services.\"\n\nPaul's eyes went from one to the other of them in disbelief. \"Enlist his\nservices? How do you know he hasn't spilled everything? What do you mean\nhe's kept the information to himself so far?\"\n\nAna said, her voice so low as to be hardly heard, \"He's my older\nbrother. I'm his favorite sister. How much longer he will keep our\nsecret I don't know. Under the circumstances, I can think of no answer\nexcept that he be eliminated.\"\n\nIt came to Paul Koslov that the team on this side could be just as\ndedicated as he was to his own particular cause.\n\nHe said, \"A Colonel Furtseva at the Soviet Embassy in Stockholm. Very\nwell. A Hungarian refugee will probably be best. If he's caught, the\nreason for the killing won't point in your direction.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Ana said, her sensitive mouth twisting. \"In fact, Anastas was in\nBudapest during the suppression there in 1956. He participated.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dacha of Leonid Shvernik was in the vicinity of Petrodvorets on the\nGulf of Finland, about eighteen miles from Leningrad proper. It would\nhave been called a summer bungalow in the States. On the rustic side.\nThree bedrooms, a moderately large living-dining room, kitchen, bath,\neven a car port. Paul Koslov took a mild satisfaction in deciding that\nan American in Shvernik's equivalent job could have afforded more of a\nplace than this.\n\nShvernik was saying, \"I hope it never gets to the point where you have\nto go on the run. If it does, this house is a center of our activities.\nAt any time you can find clothing here, weapons, money, food. Even a\nsmall boat on the waterfront. It would be possible, though difficult, to\nreach Finland.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Paul said. \"Let's hope there'll never be occasion.\"\n\nInside, they sat around a small table, over the inevitable bottle of\nvodka and cigarettes, and later coffee.\n\nShvernik said, \"Thus far we've rambled around hurriedly on a dozen\nsubjects but now we must become definite.\"\n\nPaul nodded.\n\n\"You come to us and say you represent the West and that you wish to help\noverthrow the Soviets. Fine. How do we know you do not actually\nrepresent the KGB or possibly the MVD?\"\n\nPaul said, \"I'll have to prove otherwise by actions.\" He came to his\nfeet and, ignoring Ana, pulled out his shirt tail, unbuttoned the top\ntwo buttons of his pants and unbuckled the money belt beneath.\n\nHe said, \"We have no idea what items you'll be wanting from us in the\nway of equipment, but as you said earlier all revolutions need money. So\nhere's the equivalent of a hundred thousand American dollars--in rubles,\nof course.\" He added apologetically, \"The smallness of the amount is due\nto bulk. Your Soviet money doesn't come in sufficiently high\ndenominations for a single person to carry really large amounts.\"\n\nHe tossed the money belt to the table, rearranged his clothing and\nreturned to his chair.\n\nShvernik said, \"A beginning, but I am still of the opinion that we\nshould not introduce you to any other members of the organization until\nwe have more definite proof of your background.\"\n\n\"That's reasonable,\" Paul agreed. \"Now what else?\"\n\nShvernik scowled at him. \"You claim you are an American but you speak as\ngood Russian as I do.\"\n\n\"I was raised in America,\" Paul said, \"but I never became a citizen\nbecause of some minor technicality while I was a boy. After I reached\nadulthood and first began working for the government, it was decided\nthat it might be better, due to my type of specialization, that I\ncontinue to remain legally not an American.\"\n\n\"But actually you are Russian?\"\n\n\"I was born here in Leningrad,\" Paul said evenly.\n\nAna leaned forward, \"Why then, actually, you're a traitor to Russia.\"\n\nPaul laughed. \"Look who's talking. A leader of the underground.\"\n\nAna wasn't amused. \"But there is a difference in motivation. I fight to\nimprove my country. You fight for the United States and the West.\"\n\n\"I can't see much difference. We're both trying to overthrow a vicious\nbureaucracy.\" He laughed again. \"You hate them as much as I do.\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" She frowned, trying to find words, dropped English and\nspoke in Russian. \"The Communists made mistakes, horrible mistakes\nand--especially under Stalin--were vicious beyond belief to achieve what\nthey wanted. But they did achieve it. They built our country into the\nworld's strongest.\"\n\n\"If you're so happy with them, why are you trying to eliminate the\nCommies? You don't make much sense.\"\n\nShe shook her head, as though it was he who made no sense. \"They are\nthrough now, no longer needed. A hindrance to progress.\" She hesitated,\nthen, \"When I was a student I remember being so impressed by something\nwritten by Nehru that I memorized it. He wrote it while in a British\njail in 1935. Listen.\" She closed her eyes and quoted:\n\n\"_Economic interests shape the political views of groups and classes.\nNeither reason nor moral considerations override these interests.\nIndividuals may be converted, they may surrender their special\nprivileges, although this is rare enough, but classes and groups do not\ndo so. The attempt to convert a governing and privileged class into\nforsaking power and giving up its unjust privileges has therefore always\nso far failed, and there seems to be no reason whatever to hold that it\nwill succeed in the future._\"\n\nPaul was frowning at her. \"What's your point?\"\n\n\"My point is that the Communists are in the position Nehru speaks of.\nThey're in power and won't let go. The longer they remain in power after\ntheir usefulness is over, the more vicious they must become to maintain\nthemselves. Since this is a police state the only way to get them out is\nthrough violence. That's why I find myself in the underground. But I am\na patriotic Russian!\" She turned to him. \"Why do _you_ hate the Soviets\nso, Mr. Smith?\"\n\nThe American agent shrugged. \"My grandfather was a member of the minor\naristocracy. When the Bolsheviks came to power he joined Wrangel's White\nArmy. When the Crimea fell he was in the rear guard. They shot him.\"\n\n\"That was your grandfather?\" Shvernik said.\n\n\"Right. However, my own father was a student at the Petrograd University\nat that time. Left wing inclined, in fact. I think he belonged to\nKerensky's Social Democrats. At any rate, in spite of his upper class\nbackground he made out all right for a time. In fact he became an\ninstructor and our early life wasn't particularly bad.\" Paul cleared his\nthroat. \"Until the purges in the 1930s. It was decided that my father\nwas a Bukharinist Right Deviationist, whatever that was. They came and\ngot him one night in 1938 and my family never saw him again.\"\n\nPaul disliked the subject. \"To cut it short, when the war came along, my\nmother was killed in the Nazi bombardment of Leningrad. My brother went\ninto the army and became a lieutenant. He was captured by the Germans\nwhen they took Kharkov, along with a hundred thousand or so others of\nthe Red Army. When the Soviets, a couple of years later, pushed back\ninto Poland he was recaptured.\"\n\nAna said, \"You mean liberated from the Germans?\"\n\n\"Recaptured, is the better word. The Soviets shot him. It seems that\nofficers of the Red Army aren't allowed to surrender.\"\n\nAna said painfully, \"How did you escape all this?\"\n\n\"My father must have seen the handwriting on the wall. I was only five\nyears old when he sent me to London to a cousin. A year later we moved\nto the States. Actually, I have practically no memories of Leningrad,\nvery few of my family. However, I am not very fond of the Soviets.\"\n\n\"No,\" Ana said softly.\n\nShvernik said, \"And what was your father's name?\"\n\n\"Theodore Koslov.\"\n\nShvernik said, \"I studied French literature under him.\"\n\nAna stiffened in her chair, and her eyes went wide. \"Koslov,\" she said.\n\"You must be Paul Koslov.\"\n\nPaul poured himself another small vodka. \"In my field it is a handicap\nto have a reputation. I didn't know it had extended to the man in the\nstreet on this side of the Iron Curtain.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was by no means the last trip that Paul Koslov was to make to his\nunderground contacts, nor the last visit to the dacha at Petrodvorets.\n\nIn fact, the dacha became the meeting center of the Russian underground\nwith their liaison agent from the West. Through it funneled the problems\ninvolved in the logistics of the thing. Spotted through the rest of the\nvast stretches of the country, Paul had his local agents, American,\nBritish, French, West German. But this was the center.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe Mikoyan Camera made a great success in the States. And little\nwonder. Unknown to the Soviets, the advertising campaign that sold it\ncost several times the income from the sales. All they saw were the\ncontinued orders, the repeated visits of Mr. John Smith to Leningrad on\nbuying trips. Leonid Shvernik was even given a promotion on the strength\nof his so ably cracking the American market. Ana Furtseva was\nautomatically assigned to Paul as interpreter-guide whenever he appeared\nin the Soviet Union's second capital.\n\nIn fact, when he made his \"tourist\" jaunts to the Black Sea region, to\nthe Urals, to Turkestan, to Siberia, he was able to have her assigned to\nthe whole trip with him. It gave a tremendous advantage in his work with\nthe other branches of the underground.\n\nQuestions, unthought of originally when Paul Koslov had been sent into\nthe U.S.S.R., arose as the movement progressed.\n\nOn his third visit to the dacha he said to Shvernik and three others of\nthe organization's leaders who had gathered for the conference, \"Look,\nmy immediate superior wants me to find out who is to be your top man,\nthe chief of state of the new regime when Number One and the present\nhierarchy have been overthrown.\"\n\nLeonid Shvernik looked at him blankly. By this stage, he, as well as\nAna, had become more to Paul than just pawns in the game being played.\nFor some reason, having studied under the older Koslov seemed to give a\npersonal touch that had grown.\n\nNikolai Kirichenko, a higher-up in the Moscow branch of the underground,\nlooked strangely at Paul then at Shvernik. \"What have you told him about\nthe nature of our movement?\" he demanded.\n\nPaul said, \"What's the matter? All I wanted to know was who was\nscheduled to be top man.\"\n\nShvernik said, \"Actually, I suppose we have had little time to discus\nthe nature of the new society we plan. We've been busy working on the\noverthrow of the Communists. However, I thought ...\"\n\nPaul was uneasy now. Leonid was right. Actually in his association with\nboth Ana and Leonid Shvernik they had seldom mentioned what was to\nfollow the collapse of the Soviets. It suddenly occurred to him how\noverwhelmingly important this was.\n\nNikolai Kirichenko, who spoke no English, said in Russian, \"See here, we\nare not an organization attempting to seize power for ourselves.\"\n\nThis was a delicate point, Paul sensed. Revolutions are seldom put over\nin the name of reaction or even conservatism. Whatever the final\nproduct, they are invariably presented as being motivated by liberal\nidealism and progress.\n\nHe said, \"I am familiar with the dedication of your organization. I have\nno desire to underestimate your ideals. However, my question is\npresented with good intentions and remains unanswered. You aren't\nanarchists, I know. You expect a responsible government to be in control\nafter the removal of the police state. So I repeat, who is to be your\nhead man?\"\n\n\"How would we know?\" Kirichenko blurted in irritation. \"We're working\ntoward a democracy. It's up to the Russian people to elect any officials\nthey may find necessary to govern the country.\"\n\nShvernik said, \"However, the very idea of a _head man_, as you call him,\nis opposed to what we have in mind. We aren't looking for a\nsuper-leader. We've had enough of leaders. Our experience is that it is\ntoo easy for them to become misleaders. If the history of this century\nhas proven anything with its Mussolinis, Hitlers, Stalins, Chiangs, and\nMaos, it is that the search for a leader to take over the problems of a\npeople is a vain one. The job has to be done by the people themselves.\"\n\nPaul hadn't wanted to get involved in the internals of their political\nideology. It was dangerous ground. For all he knew, there might be wide\ndifferences within the ranks of the revolutionary movement. There almost\nalways were. He couldn't take sides. His only interest in all this was\nthe overthrow of the Soviets.\n\nHe covered. \"Your point is well taken, of course. I understand\ncompletely. Oh, and here's one other matter for discussion. These radio\ntransmitters for your underground broadcasts.\"\n\nIt was a subject in which they were particularly interested. The\nRussians leaned forward.\n\n\"Here's the problem,\" Kirichenko said. \"As you know, the Soviet Union\nconsists of fifteen republics. In addition there are seventeen\nAutonomous Soviet Socialist Republics that coexist within these basic\nfifteen republics. There are also ten of what we call Autonomous\nRegions. Largely, each of these political divisions speak different\nlanguages and have their own cultural differences.\"\n\nPaul said, \"Then it will be necessary to have transmitters for each of\nthese areas?\"\n\n\"Even more. Because some are so large that we will find it necessary to\nhave more than one underground station.\"\n\nLeonid Shvernik said worriedly, \"And here is another thing. The KGB has\nthe latest in equipment for spotting the location of an illegal station.\nCan you do anything about this?\"\n\nPaul said, \"We'll put our best electronics men to work. The problem as I\nunderstand it, is to devise a method of broadcasting that the secret\npolice can't trace.\"\n\nThey looked relieved. \"Yes, that is the problem,\" Kirichenko said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe brought up the subject some time later when he was alone with Ana.\nThey were strolling along the left bank of the Neva River, paralleling\nthe Admiralty Building, supposedly on a sightseeing tour.\n\nHe said, \"I was discussing the future government with Leonid and some of\nthe others the other day. I don't think I got a very clear picture of\nit.\" He gave her a general rundown of the conversation.\n\nShe twisted her mouth characteristically at him. \"What did you expect, a\nreturn to Czarism? Let me see, who is pretender to the throne these\ndays? Some Grand Duke in Paris, isn't it?\"\n\nHe laughed with her. \"I'm not up on such questions,\" Paul admitted. \"I\nthink I rather pictured a democratic parliamentary government, somewhere\nbetween the United States and England.\"\n\n\"Those are governmental forms based on a capitalist society, Paul.\"\n\nHer hair gleamed in the brightness of the sun and he had to bring his\nmind back to the conversation.\n\n\"Well, yes. But you're overthrowing the Communists. That's the point,\nisn't it?\"\n\n\"Not the way you put it. Let's set if I can explain. To begin with,\nthere have only been three bases of government evolved by man ... I'm\ngoing to have to simplify this.\"\n\n\"It isn't my field, but go on,\" Paul said. She wore less lipstick than\nyou'd expect on an American girl but it went with her freshness.\n\n\"The first type of governmental system was based on the family. Your\nAmerican Indians were a good example. The family, the clan, the tribe.\nIn some cases, like the Iroquois Confederation, a nation of tribes. You\nwere represented in the government according to the family or clan in\nwhich you were born.\"\n\n\"Still with you so far,\" Paul said. She had a very slight dimple in her\nleft cheek. Dimples went best with blondes, Paul decided.\n\n\"The next governmental system was based on property. Chattel slavery,\nfeudalism, capitalism. In ancient Athens, for example, those Athenians\nwho owned the property of the City-State, and the slaves with which to\nwork it, also governed the nation. Under feudalism, the nobility owned\nthe country and governed it. The more land a noble owned, the larger his\nvoice in government. I'm speaking broadly, of course.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Paul said. He decided that she had more an American type\nfigure than was usual here. He brought his concentration back to the\nsubject. \"However, that doesn't apply under capitalism. We have\ndemocracy. Everyone votes, not just the owner of property.\"\n\nAna was very serious about it. \"You mustn't use the words capitalism and\ndemocracy interchangeably. You can have capitalism, which is a social\nsystem, without having democracy which is a political system. For\ninstance, when Hitler was in power in Germany the government was a\ndictatorship but the social system was still capitalism.\"\n\nThen she grinned at him mischievously. \"Even in the United States I\nthink you'll find that the people who own a capitalist country run the\ncountry. Those who control great wealth have a large say in the running\nof the political parties, both locally and nationally. Your smaller\nproperty owners have a smaller voice in local politics. But how large a\nlobby does your itinerant harvest worker in Texas have in Washington?\"\n\nPaul said, slightly irritated now, \"This is a big subject and I don't\nagree with you. However, I'm not interested now in the government of the\nUnited States. I want to know what you people have in store for Russia,\nif and when you take over.\"\n\nShe shook her head in despair at him. \"That's the point the others were\ntrying to make to you. We have no intention of taking over. We don't\nwant to and probably couldn't even if we did want to. What we're\nadvocating is a new type of government based on a new type of\nrepresentation.\"\n\nHe noticed the faint touch of freckles about her nose, her shoulders--to\nthe extent her dress revealed them--and on her arms. Her skin was fair\nas only the northern races produce.\n\nPaul said, \"All right. Now we get to this third base of government. The\nfirst was the family, the second was property. What else is there?\"\n\n\"In an ultramodern, industrialized society, there is your method of\nmaking your livelihood. In the future you will be represented from where\nyou work. From your industry or profession. The parliament, or congress,\nof the nation would consist of elected members from each branch of\nproduction, distribution, communication, education, medicine--\"\n\n\"Syndicalism,\" Paul said, \"with some touches of Technocracy.\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"Your American Technocracy of the 1930s I am not too\nfamiliar with, although I understand power came from top to bottom,\nrather than from bottom to top, democratically. The early syndicalists\ndeveloped some of the ideas which later thinkers have elaborated upon, I\nsuppose. So many of these terms have become all but meaningless through\nsloppy use. What in the world does Socialism mean, for instance?\nAccording to some, your Roosevelt was a Socialist. Hitler called himself\na National Socialist. Mussolini once edited a Socialist paper. Stalin\ncalled himself a Socialist and the British currently have a Socialist\ngovernment--mind you, with a Queen on the throne.\"\n\n\"The advantage of voting from where you work rather than from where you\nlive doesn't come home to me,\" Paul said.\n\n\"Among other things, a person knows the qualifications of the people\nwith whom he works,\" Ana said, \"whether he is a scientist in a\nlaboratory or a technician in an automated factory. But how many people\nactually know anything about the political candidates for whom they\nvote?\"\n\n\"I suppose we could discuss this all day,\" Paul said. \"But what I was\ngetting to is what happens when your outfit takes over here in\nLeningrad? Does Leonid become local commissar, or head of police, or ...\nwell, whatever new title you've dreamed up?\"\n\nAna laughed at him, as though he was impossible. \"Mr. Koslov, you have a\nmind hard to penetrate. I keep telling you, we, the revolutionary\nunderground, have no desire to take over and don't think that we could\neven if we wished. When the Soviets are overthrown by our organisation,\nthe new government will assume power. We disappear as an organization.\nOur job is done. Leonid? I don't know, perhaps his fellow employees at\nthe Mikoyan Camera works will vote him into some office in the plant, if\nthey think him capable enough.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Paul sighed, \"it's your country. I'll stick to the American\nsystem.\" He couldn't take his eyes from the way her lips tucked in at\nthe sides.\n\nAna said, \"How long have you been in love with me, Paul?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nShe laughed. \"Don't be so blank. It would be rather odd, wouldn't it, if\ntwo people were in love, and neither of them realized what had\nhappened?\"\n\n\"_Two_ people in love,\" he said blankly, unbelievingly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLeonid Shvernik and Paul Koslov were bent over a map of the U.S.S.R. The\nformer pointed out the approximate location of the radio transmitters.\n\"We're not going to use them until the last moment,\" he said. \"Not until\nthe fat is in the fire. Then they will all begin at once. The KGB and\nMVD won't have time to knock them out.\"\n\nPaul said, \"Things are moving fast. Faster than I had expected. We're\nputting it over, Leonid.\"\n\nShvernik said, \"Only because the situation is ripe. It's the way\nrevolutions work.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\" Paul said absently, studying the map.\n\n\"Individuals don't put over revolutions. The times do, the conditions\napply. Did you know that six months before the Bolshevik revolution took\nplace Lenin wrote that he never expected to live to see the Communist\ntake over in Russia? The thing was that the conditions were there. The\nBolsheviks, as few as they were, were practically thrown into power.\"\n\n\"However,\" Paul said dryly, \"it was mighty helpful to have such men as\nLenin and Trotsky handy.\"\n\nShvernik shrugged. \"The times make the men. Your own American Revolution\nis probably better known to you. Look at the men those times produced.\nJefferson, Paine, Madison, Hamilton, Franklin, Adams. And once again, if\nyou had told any of those men, a year before the Declaration of\nIndependence, that a complete revolution was the only solution to the\nproblems that confronted them, they would probably have thought you\ninsane.\"\n\nIt was a new line of thought for Paul Koslov. \"Then what does cause a\nrevolution?\"\n\n\"The need for it. It's not just our few tens of thousands of members of\nthe underground who see the need for overthrowing the Soviet\nbureaucracy. It's millions of average Russians in every walk of life and\nevery strata, from top to bottom. What does the scientist think when\nsome bureaucrat knowing nothing of his speciality comes into the\nlaboratory and directs his work? What does the engineer in an automobile\nplant think when some silly politician decides that since cars in\ncapitalist countries have four wheels, that Russia should surpass them\nby producing a car with five? What does your scholar think when he is\ntold what to study, how to interpret it, and then what to write? What\ndoes your worker think when he sees the bureaucrat living in luxury\nwhile his wage is a comparatively meager one? What do your young people\nthink in their continual striving for a greater degree of freedom than\nwas possessed by their parents? What does your painter think? Your poet?\nYour philosopher?\"\n\nShvernik shook his head. \"When a nation is ready for revolution, it's\nthe _people_ who put it over. Often, the so-called leaders are hard put\nto run fast enough to say out in front.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPaul said, \"After it's all over, we'll go back to the States. I know a\ntown up in the Sierras called Grass Valley. Hunting, fishing, mountains,\nclean air, but still available to cities such as San Francisco where you\ncan go for shopping and for restaurants and entertainment.\"\n\nShe kissed him again.\n\nPaul said, \"You know, I've done this sort of work--never on this scale\nbefore, of course--ever since I was nineteen. Nineteen, mind you! And\nthis is the first time I've realized I'm tired of it. Fed up to here.\nI'm nearly thirty-five, Ana, and for the first time I want what a man is\nexpected to want out of life. A woman, a home, children. You've never\nseen America. You'll love it. You'll like Americans too, especially the\nkind that live in places like Grass Valley.\"\n\nAna laughed softly. \"But we're Russians, Paul.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Our home and our life should be here. In Russia. The New Russia that\nwe'll have shortly.\"\n\nHe scoffed at her. \"Live here when there's California? Ana, Ana, you\ndon't know what living is. Why--\"\n\n\"But, Paul, I'm a Russian. If the United States is a more pleasant place\nto live than Russia will be, when we have ended the police state, then\nit is part of my duty to improve Russia.\"\n\nIt suddenly came to him that she meant it. \"But I was thinking, all\nalong, that after this was over we'd be married. I'd be able to show you\n_my_ country.\"\n\n\"And, I don't know why, I was thinking we both expected to be making a\nlife for ourselves here.\"\n\nThey were silent for a long time in mutual misery.\n\nPaul said finally, \"This is no time to make detailed plans. We love each\nother, that should be enough. When it's all over, we'll have the chance\nto look over each other's way of life. You can visit the States with\nme.\"\n\n\"And I'll take you on a visit to Armenia. I know a little town in the\nmountains there which is the most beautiful in the world. We'll spend a\nweek there. A month! Perhaps one day we can build a summer dacha there.\"\nShe laughed happily. \"Why practically everyone lives to be a hundred\nyears old in Armenia.\"\n\n\"Yeah, we'll have to go there sometime,\" Paul said quietly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe'd been scheduled to see Leonid that night but at the last moment the\nother sent Ana to report that an important meeting was to take place. A\nmeeting of underground delegates from all over the country. They were\nmaking basic decisions on when to move--but Paul's presence wasn't\nneeded.\n\nHe had no feeling of being excluded from something that concerned him.\nLong ago it had been decided that the less details known by the average\nman in the movement about Paul's activities, the better it would be.\nThere is always betrayal and there are always counter-revolutionary\nagents within the ranks of an organization such as this. What was the\nold Russian proverb? When four men sit down to discuss revolution, three\nare police spies and the third a fool.\n\nActually, this had been astonishingly well handled. He had operated for\nover a year with no signs that the KGB was aware of his activities.\nLeonid and his fellows were efficient. They had to be. The Commies had\nbeen slaughtering anyone who opposed them for forty years now. To\nsurvive as a Russian underground you had to be good.\n\nNo, it wasn't a feeling of exclusion. Paul Koslov was stretched out on\nthe bed of his king-size Astoria Hotel room, his hands behind his head\nand staring up at the ceiling. He recapitulated the events of the past\nmonths from the time he'd entered the Chief's office in Washington until\nlast night at the dacha with Leonid and Ana.\n\nThe whole thing.\n\nAnd over and over again.\n\nThere was a line of worry on his forehead.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe swung his feet to the floor and approached the closet. He selected\nhis most poorly pressed pair of pants, and a coat that mismatched it. He\nchecked the charge in his .38 Noiseless, and replaced the weapon under\nhis left arm. He removed his partial bridge, remembering as he did so\nhow he had lost the teeth in a street fight with some Commie union\norganizers in Panama, and replaced the porcelain bridge with a typically\nRussian gleaming steel one. He stuffed a cap into his back pocket, a\npair of steel rimmed glasses into an inner pocket, and left the room.\n\nHe hurried through the lobby, past the Intourist desk, thankful that it\nwas a slow time of day for tourist activity.\n\nOutside, he walked several blocks to 25th of October Avenue and made a\npoint of losing himself in the crowd. When he was sure that there could\nbe no one behind him, he entered a _pivnaya_, had a glass of beer, and\nthen disappeared into the toilet. There he took off the coat, wrinkled\nit a bit more, put it back on and also donned the cap and glasses. He\nremoved his tie and thrust it into a side pocket.\n\nHe left, in appearance a more or less average workingman of Leningrad,\nwalked to the bus station on Nashimson Volodarski and waited for the\nnext bus to Petrodvorets. He would have preferred the subway, but the\nline didn't run that far as yet.\n\nThe bus took him to within a mile and a half of the dacha, and he walked\nfrom there.\n\nBy this time Paul was familiar with the security measures taken by\nLeonid Shvernik and the others. None at all when the dacha wasn't in use\nfor a conference or to hide someone on the lam from the KGB. But at a\ntime like this, there would be three sentries, carefully spotted.\n\nThis was Paul's field now. Since the age of nineteen, he told himself\nwryly. He wondered if there was anyone in the world who could go through\na line of sentries as efficiently as he could.\n\nHe approached the dacha at the point where the line of pine trees came\nnearest to it. On his belly he watched for ten minutes before making the\nfinal move to the side of the house. He lay up against it, under a bush.\n\nFrom an inner pocket he brought the spy device he had acquired from\nDerek Steven's Rube Goldberg department. It looked and was supposed to\nlook considerably like a doctor's stethoscope. He placed it to his ears,\npressed the other end to the wall of the house.\n\nLeonid Shvernik was saying, \"Becoming killers isn't a pleasant prospect\nbut it was the Soviet who taught us that the end justifies the means.\nAnd so ruthless a dictatorship have they established that there is\nliterally no alternative. The only way to remove them is by violence.\nHappily, so we believe, the violence need extend to only a small number\nof the very highest of the hierarchy. Once they are eliminated and our\ntransmitters proclaim the new revolution, there should be little further\nopposition.\"\n\nSomeone sighed deeply--Paul was able to pick up even that.\n\n\"Why discuss it further?\" somebody whose voice Paul didn't recognize,\nasked. \"Let's get onto other things. These broadcasts of ours have to be\nthe ultimate in the presentation of our program. The assassination of\nNumber One and his immediate supporters is going to react unfavorably at\nfirst. We're going to have to present unanswerable arguments if our\nmovement is to sweep the nation as we plan.\"\n\nA new voice injected, \"We've put the best writers in the Soviet Union to\nwork on the scripts. For all practical purposes they are completed.\"\n\n\"We haven't yet decided what to say about the H-Bomb, the missiles, all\nthe endless equipment of war that has accumulated under the Soviets, not\nto speak of the armies, the ships, the aircraft and all the personnel\nwho man them.\"\n\nSomeone else, it sounded like Nikolai Kirichenko, from Moscow, said.\n\"I'm chairman of the committee on that. It's our opinion that we're\ngoing to have to cover that matter in our broadcasts to the people and\nthe only answer is that until the West has agreed to nuclear\ndisarmament, we're going to have to keep our own.\"\n\nLeonid said, and there was shock in his voice, \"But that's one of the\nmost basic reasons for the new revolution, to eliminate this mad arms\nrace, this devoting half the resources of the world to armament.\"\n\n\"Yes, but what can we do? How do we know that the Western powers won't\nattack? And please remember that it is no longer just the United States\nthat has nuclear weapons. If we lay down our defenses, we are capable of\nbeing destroyed by England, France, West Germany, even Turkey or Japan!\nAnd consider, too, that the economies of some of the Western powers are\nbased on the production of arms to the point that if such production\nended, overnight, depressions would sweep their nations. In short, they\ncan't afford a world without tensions.\"\n\n\"It's a problem for the future to solve,\" someone else said. \"But\nmeanwhile I believe the committee is right. Until it is absolutely\nproven that we need have no fears about the other nations, we must keep\nour own strength.\"\n\nUnder his hedge, Paul grimaced, but he was getting what he came for, a\ndiscussion of policy, without the restrictions his presence would have\nput on the conversation.\n\n\"Let's deal with a more pleasant subject,\" a feminine voice said. \"Our\nbroadcasts should stress to the people that for the first time in the\nhistory of Russia we will be truly in the position to lead the world!\nFor fifty years the Communists attempted to convert nations into\nadopting their system, and largely they were turned down. Those\ncountries that did become Communist either did so at the point of the\nRed Army's bayonet or under the stress of complete collapse such as in\nChina. But tomorrow, and the New Russia? Freed from the inadequacy and\ninefficiency of the bureaucrats who have misruled us, we'll develop a\nproductive machine that will be the envy of the world!\" Her voice had\nall but a fanatical ring.\n\nSomeone else chuckled, \"If the West thought they had competition from us\nbefore, wait until they see the New Russia!\"\n\nPaul thought he saw someone, a shadow, at the side of the clearing. His\nlips thinned and the .38 Noiseless was in his hand magically.\n\nFalse alarm.\n\nHe turned back to the \"conversation\" inside.\n\nKirichenko's voice was saying, \"It is hard for me not to believe that\nwithin a period of a year or so half the countries of the world will\nfollow our example.\"\n\n\"Half!\" someone laughed exuberantly. \"The world, Comrades! The new\nsystem will sweep the world. For the first time in history the world\nwill see what Marx and Engels were _really_ driving at!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBack at the hotel, toward morning, Paul was again stretched out on the\nbed, hands under his head, his eyes unseeingly staring at the ceiling as\nhe went through his agonizing reappraisal.\n\nThere was Ana.\n\nAnd there was even Leonid Shvernik and some of the others of the\nunderground. As close friends as he had ever made in a life that\nadmittedly hadn't been prone to friendship.\n\nAnd there was Russia, the country of his birth. Beyond the underground\nmovement, beyond the Soviet regime, beyond the Romanoff Czars. Mother\nRussia. The land of his parents, his grandparents, the land of his\nroots.\n\nAnd, of course, there was the United States and the West. The West which\nhad received him in his hour of stress in his flight from _Mother_\nRussia. Mother Russia, ha! What kind of a mother had she been to the\nKoslovs? To his grandfather, his father, his mother and brother? Where\nwould he, Paul, be today had he as a child not been sent fleeing to the\nWest?\n\nAnd his life work. What of that? Since the age of nineteen, when a\nnormal teenager would have been in school, preparing himself for life.\nSince nineteen he had been a member of the anti-Soviet team.\n\nA star, too! Paul Koslov, the trouble-shooter, the always reliable,\ncold, ruthless. Paul Koslov on whom you could always depend to carry the\nball.\n\nAnti-Soviet, or anti-Russian?\n\nWhy kid himself about his background. It meant nothing. He was an\nAmerican. He had only the faintest of memories of his family or of the\ncountry. Only because people told him so did he know he was a Russian.\nHe was as American as it is possible to get.\n\nWhat had he told such Westerners, born and bred, as Lord Carrol and\nDerek Stevens? _If he wasn't a member of the team, there just wasn't a\nteam._\n\nBut then, of course, there was Ana.\n\nYes, Ana. But what, actually, was there in the future for them? Now that\nhe considered it, could he really picture her sitting in the drug store\non Montez Street, Grass Valley, having a banana split?\n\nAna was Russian. As patriotic a Russian as it was possible to be. As\nmuch a dedicated member of the Russian team as it was possible to be.\nAnd as a team member, she, like Paul, knew the chances that were\ninvolved. You didn't get to be a star by sitting on the bench. She\nhadn't hesitated, in the clutch, to sacrifice her favorite brother.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPaul Koslov propped the Tracy, the wristwatch-like radio before him,\nplacing its back to a book. He made it operative, began to repeat,\n\"Paul calling. Paul calling.\"\n\nA thin, far away voice said finally, \"O.K. Paul. I'm receiving.\"\n\nPaul Koslov took a deep breath and said, \"All right, this is it. In just\na few days we're all set to kick off. Understand?\"\n\n\"I understand, Paul.\"\n\n\"Is it possible that anybody else can be receiving this?\"\n\n\"Absolutely impossible.\"\n\n\"All right, then this is it. The boys here are going to start their\nrevolution going by knocking off not only Number One, but also Two,\nThree, Four, Six and Seven of the hierarchy. Number Five is one of\ntheirs.\"\n\nThe thin voice said, \"You know I don't want details. They're up to you.\"\n\nPaul grimaced. \"This is why I called. You've got to make--or someone's\ngot to make--one hell of an important decision in the next couple of\ndays. It's not up to me. For once I'm not to be brushed off with that\n'don't bother me with details,' routine.\"\n\n\"Decision? What decision? You said everything was all ready to go,\ndidn't you?\"\n\n\"Look,\" Paul Koslov said, \"remember when you gave me this assignment.\nWhen you told me about the Germans sending Lenin up to Petrograd in\nhopes he'd start a revolution and the British sending Somerset Maugham\nto try and prevent it?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, man. What's that got to do with it?\" Even over the long\ndistance, the Chief's voice sounded puzzled.\n\n\"Supposedly the Germans were successful, and Maugham failed. But looking\nback at it a generation later, did the Germans win out by helping bring\noff the Bolshevik revolution? The Soviets destroyed them for all time as\na first-rate power at Stalingrad, twenty-five years afterwards.\"\n\nThe voice from Washington was impatient. \"What's your point, Paul?\"\n\n\"My point is this. When you gave me this assignment, you told me I was\nin the position of the German who engineered bringing Lenin up to\nPetrograd to start the Bolsheviks rolling. Are you _sure_ that the\nopposite isn't true? Are you sure it isn't Maugham's job I should have?\nLet me tell you, Chief, these boys I'm working with now are sharp,\nthey've got more on the ball than these Commie bureaucrats running the\ncountry have a dozen times over.\n\n\"Chief, this is the decision that has to be made in the next couple of\ndays. Just who do we want eliminated? Are you sure you don't want me to\ntip off the KGB to this whole conspiracy?\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ May 1960.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
