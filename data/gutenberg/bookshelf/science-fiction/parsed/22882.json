Pete Farnam never knew if\nthe timing had been planned that way or not. It might have been\ncoincidence that it came just when the colony was predicting its first\nreal bumper crop of all time. When it was all over, Pete and Mario and\nthe rest tried to figure it out, but none of them ever knew for sure\njust _what_ had happened back on Earth, or _when_ it had actually\nhappened. There was too little information to go on, and practically\nnone that they could trust. All Pete Farnam really knew, that day, was\nthat this was the wrong year for a ship from Earth to land on Baron IV.\n\nPete was out on the plantation when it landed. As usual, his sprayer had\ngotten clogged; tarring should have been started earlier, before it got\nso cold that the stuff clung to the nozzle and hardened before the spray\ncould settle into the dusty soil. The summer past had been the colony's\nfinest in the fourteen years he'd been there, a warm, still summer with\nplenty of rain to keep the dirt down and let the _taaro_ get well rooted\nand grow up tall and gray against the purple sky. But now the _taaro_\nwas harvested. It was waiting, compressed and crated, ready for\nshipment, and the heavy black clouds were scudding nervously across the\nsky, faster with every passing day. Two days ago Pete had asked Mario to\nsee about firing up the little furnaces the Dusties had built to help\nthem fight the winter. All that remained now was tarring the fields, and\nthen buckling down beneath the wind shields before the first winter\nstorms struck.\n\nPete was trying to get the nozzle of the tar sprayer cleaned out when\nMario's jeep came roaring down the rutted road from the village in a\ncloud of dust. In the back seat a couple of Dusties were bouncing up and\ndown like happy five-year-olds. The brakes squealed and Mario bellowed\nat him from the road. \"Pete! The ship's in! Better get hopping!\"\n\nPete nodded and started to close up the sprayer. One of the Dusties\ntumbled out of the jeep and scampered across the field to give him a\nhand. It was an inexpert hand to say the least, but the Dusties seemed\nso proud of the little they were able to learn about mechanized farming\nthat nobody had the heart to shoo them away. Pete watched the fuzzy\nbrown creature get its paws thoroughly gummed up with tar before he\npulled him loose and sent him back to the jeep with a whack on the\nbackside. He finished the job himself, grabbed his coat from the back of\nthe sprayer, and pulled himself into the front seat of the jeep.\n\nMario started the little car back down the road. The young colonist's\nface was coated with dust, emphasizing the lines of worry around his\neyes. \"I don't like it, Pete. There isn't any ship due this year.\"\n\n\"When did it land?\"\n\n\"About twenty minutes ago. Won't be cool for a while yet.\"\n\nPete laughed. \"Maybe Old Schooner is just getting lonesome to swap tall\nstories with us. Maybe he's even bringing us a locker of T-bones. Who\nknows?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Mario without conviction.\n\nPete looked at him, and shrugged. \"Why complain if they're early? Maybe\nthey've found some new way to keep our fields from blowing away on us\nevery winter.\" He stared across at the heavy windbreaks between the\nfields--long, ragged structures built in hope of outwitting the vicious\nwinds that howled across the land during the long winter. Pete picked\nbits of tar from his beard, and wiped the dirt from his forehead with\nthe back of his hand. \"This tarring is mean,\" he said wearily. \"Glad to\ntake a break.\"\n\n\"Maybe Cap Schooner will know something about the rumors we've been\nhearing,\" Mario said gloomily.\n\nPete looked at him sharply. \"About Earth?\"\n\nMario nodded. \"Schooner's a pretty good guy, I guess. I mean, he'd tell\nus if anything was _really_ wrong back home, wouldn't he?\"\n\nPete nodded, and snapped his fingers. One of the Dusties hopped over\ninto his lap and began gawking happily at the broad fields as the jeep\njogged along. Pete stroked the creature's soft brown fur with his\ntar-caked fingers. \"Maybe someday these little guys will show us where\n_they_ go for the winter,\" he said. \"They must have it down to a\nscience.\"\n\nSomehow the idea was funny, and both men roared. If the Dusties had\n_anything_ down to a science, nobody knew what. Mario grinned and\ntweaked the creature's tail. \"They sure do beat the winter, though,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"So do we. Only we have to do it the human way. These fellas grew up in\nthe climate.\" Pete lapsed into silence as the village came into view.\nThe ship had landed quite a way out, resting on its skids on the long\nshallow groove the colonists had bulldozed out for it years before, the\nfirst year they had arrived on Baron IV. Slowly Pete turned Mario's\nwords over in his mind, allowing himself to worry a little. There _had_\nbeen rumors of trouble back on Earth, persistent rumors he had taken\ncare to soft-pedal, as mayor of the colony. There were other things,\ntoo, like the old newspapers and magazines that had been brought in by\nthe lad from Baron II, and the rare radio message they could pick up\nthrough their atmospheric disturbance. Maybe something _was_ going wrong\nback home. But somehow political upheavals on Earth seemed remote to\nthese hardened colonists. Captain Schooner's visits were always welcome,\nbut they were few and far between. The colony was small; one ship every\nthree years could supply it, and even then the _taaro_ crates wouldn't\nhalf fill up the storage holds. There were other colonies far closer to\nhome that sent back more _taaro_ in one year than Baron IV could grow in\nten.\n\nBut when a ship did come down, it was a time of high excitement. It\nmeant fresh food from Earth, meat from the frozen lockers, maybe even a\nlittle candy and salt. And always for Pete a landing meant a long\nevening of palaver with the captain about things back home and things on\nBaron IV.\n\nPete smiled to himself as he thought of it. He could remember Earth, of\ncourse, with a kind of vague nostalgia, but Baron IV was home to him now\nand he knew he would never leave it. He had too many hopes invested\nthere, too many years of heartache and desperate hard work, too much\ndeep satisfaction in having cut a niche for himself on this dusty,\nhostile world, ever to think much about Earth any more.\n\nMario stopped in front of the offices, and one of the Dusties hopped out\nahead of Pete. The creature strode across the rough gravel to the door,\npulling tar off his fingers just as he had seen Pete do. Pete followed\nhim to the door, and then stopped, frowning. There should have been a\nbabble of voices inside, with Captain Schooner's loud laugh roaring\nabove the excitement. But Pete could hear nothing. A chill of uneasiness\nran through him; he pushed open the door and walked inside. A dozen of\nhis friends looked up silently, avoiding the eyes of the uniformed\nstranger in the center of the room. When he saw the man, Pete Farnam\nknew something was wrong indeed.\n\nIt wasn't Captain Schooner. It was a man he'd never seen before.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Dustie ran across the room in front of Pete and hopped up on the\ndesk as though he owned it, throwing his hands on his hips and staring\nat the stranger curiously. Pete took off his cap and parka and dropped\nthem on a chair. \"Well,\" he said. \"This is a surprise. We weren't\nexpecting a ship so soon.\"\n\nThe man inclined his head stiffly and glanced down at the paper he held\nin his hand. \"You're Peter Farnam, I suppose? Mayor of this colony?\"\n\n\"That's right. And you?\"\n\n\"Varga is the name,\" the captain said shortly. \"Earth Security and\nSupply.\" He nodded toward the small, frail-looking man in civilian\nclothes, sitting beside him. \"This is Rupert Nathan, of the Colonial\nService. You'll be seeing a great deal of him.\" He held out a small\nwallet of papers. \"Our credentials, Farnam. Be so good as to examine\nthem.\"\n\nPete glanced around the room. John Tegan and Hank Mario were watching\nhim uneasily. Mary Turner was following the proceedings with her sharp\nlittle eyes, missing nothing, and Mel Dorfman stood like a rock, his\nheavy face curiously expressionless as he watched the visitors. Pete\nreached out for the papers, flipped through them, and handed them back\nwith a long look at Captain Varga.\n\nHe was younger than Captain Schooner, with sandy hair and pale eyes that\nlooked up at Pete from a soft baby face. Clean-shaven, his whole person\nseemed immaculate as he leaned back calmly in the chair. His civilian\ncompanion, however, had indecision written in every line of his pink\nface. His hands fluttered nervously, and he avoided the colonist's eyes.\n\nPete turned to the captain. \"The papers say you're our official supply\nship,\" he said. \"You're early, but an Earth ship is always good news.\"\nHe clucked at the Dustie, who was about to go after one of the shiny\nbuttons on the captain's blouse. The little brown creature hopped over\nand settled on Pete's knee. \"We've been used to seeing Captain\nSchooner.\"\n\nThe captain and Nathan exchanged glances. \"Captain Schooner has retired\nfrom Security Service,\" the captain said shortly. \"You won't be seeing\nhim again. But we have a cargo for your colony. You may send these\npeople over to the ship to start unloading now, if you wish--\" his eye\nswept the circle of windburned faces--\"while Nathan and I discuss\ncertain matters with you here.\"\n\nNobody moved for a moment. Then Pete nodded to Mario. \"Take the boys out\nto unload, Jack. We'll see you back here in an hour or so.\"\n\n\"Pete, are you sure--\"\n\n\"Don't worry. Take Mel and Hank along to lend a hand.\" Pete turned back\nto Captain Varga. \"Suppose we go inside to more comfortable quarters,\"\nhe said. \"We're always glad to have word from Earth.\"\n\nThey passed through a dark, smelly corridor into Pete's personal\nquarters. For a colony house, if wasn't bad--good plastic chairs, a\nhand-made rug on the floor, even one of Mary Turner's paintings on the\nwall, and several of the weird, stylized carvings the Dusties had done\nfor Pete. But the place smelled of tar and sweat, and Captain Varga's\nnose wrinkled in distaste. Nathan drew out a large silk handkerchief and\nwiped his pink hands, touching his nose daintily.\n\nThe Dustie hopped into the room ahead of them and settled into the\nbiggest, most comfortable chair. Pete snapped his fingers sharply, and\nthe brown creature jumped down again like a naughty child and climbed up\non Pete's knee. The captain glanced at the chair with disgust and sat\ndown in another. \"Do you actually let those horrid creatures have the\nrun of your house?\" he asked.\n\n\"Why not?\" Pete said. \"We have the run of their planet. They're quite\nharmless, really. And quite clean.\"\n\nThe captain sniffed. \"Nasty things. Might find a use for the furs,\nthough. They look quite soft.\"\n\n\"We don't kill Dusties,\" said Pete coolly. \"They're friendly, and\nintelligent too, in a childish sort of way.\" He looked at the captain\nand Nathan, and decided not to put on the coffee pot. \"Now what's the\ntrouble?\"\n\n\"No trouble at all,\" the captain said, \"except the trouble you choose to\nmake. You have your year's _taaro_ ready for shipping?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nThe captain took out a small pencil on a chain and began to twirl it.\n\"How much, to be exact?\"\n\n\"Twenty thousand, Earth weight.\"\n\n\"Tons?\"\n\nPete shook his head. \"Hundredweight.\"\n\nThe captain raised his eyebrows. \"I see. And there are--\" he consulted\nthe papers in his hand--\"roughly two hundred and twenty colonists here\non Baron IV. Is that right?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Seventy-four men, eighty-one women, and fifty-nine children, to be\nexact?\"\n\n\"I'd have to look it up. Margaret Singman had twins the other night.\"\n\n\"Well, don't be ridiculous,\" snapped the captain. \"On a planet the size\nof Baron IV, with seventy-four men, you should be producing a dozen\ntimes the _taaro_ you stated. We'll consider that your quota for a\nstarter, at least. You have ample seed, according to my records. I\nshould think, with the proper equipment--\"\n\n\"Now wait a minute,\" Pete said softly. \"We're fighting a climate here,\ncaptain. You should know that. We have only a two-planting season, and\nthe 'proper equipment,' as you call it, doesn't operate too well out\nhere. It has a way of clogging up with dust in the summer, and rusting\nin the winter.\"\n\n\"Really,\" said Captain Varga. \"As I was saying, with the proper\nequipment, you could cultivate a great deal more land than you seem to\nbe using. This would give you the necessary heavier yield. Wouldn't you\nsay so, Nathan?\"\n\nThe little nervous man nodded. \"Certainly, captain. With the proper\norganization of labor.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense,\" Pete said, suddenly angry. \"Nobody can get that kind\nof yield from this planet. The ground won't give it, and the men won't\ngrow it.\"\n\nThe captain gave him a long look. \"Really?\" he said. \"I think you're\nwrong. I think the men will grow it.\"\n\nPete stood up slowly. \"What are you trying to say? This business about\nquotas and organization of labor--\"\n\n\"You didn't read our credentials as we instructed you, Farnam. Mr.\nNathan is the official governor of the colony on Baron IV, as of now.\nYou'll find him most co-operative, I'm sure, but he's answerable\ndirectly to me in all matters. My job is administration of the entire\nBaron system. Clear enough?\"\n\nPete's eyes were dark. \"I think you'd better draw me a picture,\" he said\ntightly. \"A very clear picture.\"\n\n\"Very well. Baron IV is not paying for its upkeep. _Taaro_, after all,\nis not the most necessary of crops in the universe. It has value, but\nnot very much value, all things considered. If the production of _taaro_\nhere is not increased sharply, it may be necessary to close down the\ncolony altogether.\"\n\n\"You're a liar,\" said Pete shortly. \"The Colonization Board makes no\nproduction demands on the colonies. Nor does it farm out systems for\npersonal exploitation.\"\n\nThe captain smiled. \"The Colonization Board, as you call it, has\nundergone a slight reorganization,\" he said.\n\n\"_Reorganization!_ It's a top-level board in the Earth Government!\nNothing could reorganize it but a wholesale--\" He broke off, his jaw\nsagging as the implication sank in.\n\n\"You're rather out on a limb, you see,\" said the captain coolly. \"Poor\ncommunications and all that. The fact is that the entire Earth\nGovernment has undergone a slight reorganization also.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Dustie knew that something had happened.\n\nPete didn't know how he knew. The Dusties couldn't talk, couldn't make\n_any_ noise, as far as Pete knew. But they always seemed to know when\nsomething unusual was happening. It was wrong, really, to consider them\nunintelligent animals. There are other sorts of intelligence than human,\nand other sorts of communication, and other sorts of culture. The Baron\nIV colonists had never understood the queer perceptive sense that the\nDusties seemed to possess, any more than they knew how many Dusties\nthere were, or what they ate, or where on the planet they lived. All\nthey knew was that when they landed on Baron IV, the Dusties were there.\n\nAt first the creatures had been very timid. For weeks the men and women,\nbusy with their building, had paid little attention to the skittering\nbrown forms that crept down from the rocky hills to watch them with big,\ncurious eyes. They were about half the size of men, and strangely\nhumanoid in appearance, not in the sense that a monkey is humanoid (for\nthey did _not_ resemble monkeys) but in some way the colonists could not\nquite pin down. It may have been the way they walked around on their\nlong, fragile hind legs, the way they stroked their pointed chins as\nthey sat and watched and listened with their pointed ears lifted\nalertly, watching with soft gray eyes, or the way they handled objects\nwith their little four-fingered hands. They were so remarkably\nhuman-like in their elfin way that the colonists couldn't help but be\ndrawn to the creatures.\n\nThat whole first summer, when the colonists were building the village\nand the landing groove for the ships, the Dusties were among them,\ntrying pathetically to help, so eager for friendship that even\noccasional rebuffs failed to drive them away. They _liked_ the colony.\nThey seemed, somehow, to savor the atmosphere, moving about like solemn,\nfuzzy overseers as the work progressed through the summer. Pete Farnam\nthought that they had even tried to warn the people about the winter.\nBut the colonists couldn't understand, of course. Not until later. The\nDusties became a standing joke, and were tolerated with considerable\namusement--until the winter struck.\n\nIt had come with almost unbelievable ferocity. The houses had not been\ncompleted when the first hurricanes came, and they were smashed into\ntoothpicks. The winds came, vicious winds full of dust and sleet and\nice, wild erratic twisting gales that ripped the village to shreds,\ntearing off the topsoil that had been broken and fertilized--merciless,\nnever-ending winds that wailed and screamed the planet's protest. The\nwinds drove sand and dirt and ice into the heart of the generators, and\nthe heating units corroded and jammed and went dead. The jeeps and\ntractors and bulldozers were scored and rusted. The people began dying\nby the dozens as they huddled down in the pitiful little pits they had\ndug to try to keep the winds away.\n\nFew of them were still conscious when the Dusties had come silently, in\nthe blizzard, eyes closed tight against the blast, to drag the people up\ninto the hills, into caves and hollows that still showed the fresh marks\nof carving tools. They had brought food--what kind of food nobody knew,\nfor the colony's food had been destroyed by the first blast of the\nhurricane--but whatever it was it had kept them alive. And somehow, the\ncolonists had survived the winter which seemed never to end. There were\nfrozen legs and ruined eyes; there was pneumonia so swift and virulent\nthat even the antibiotics they managed to salvage could not stop it;\nthere was near-starvation--but they were kept alive, until the winds\nbegan to die, and they walked out of their holes in the ground to see\nthe ruins of their first village.\n\nFrom that winter on, nobody considered the Dusties funny any more. What\nhad motivated them no one knew, but the colony owed them their lives.\nThe Dusties tried to help the people rebuild. They showed them how to\nbuild windshields that would keep houses intact and anchored to the\nground when the winds came again. They built little furnaces out of dirt\nand rock which defied the winds and gave great heat. They showed the\ncolonists a dozen things they needed to know for life on the rugged\nplanet. The colonists in turn tried to teach the Dusties something about\nEarth, and how the colonists had lived, and why they had come. But there\nwas a barrier of intelligence that could not be crossed. The Dusties\nlearned simple things, but only slowly and imperfectly. They seemed\ncontent to take on their mock overseer's role, moving in and about the\nvillage, approving or disapproving, but always trying to help. Some\nbecame personal pets, though \"pet\" was the wrong word, because it was\nmore of a strange personal friendship limited by utter lack of\ncommunication, than any animal-and-master relationship. The colonists\nmade sure that the Dusties were granted the respect due them as rightful\nmasters of Baron IV. And somehow the Dusties perceived this attitude,\nand were so grateful for the acceptance and friendship that there seemed\nnothing they wouldn't do for the colonists.\n\nThere had been many discussions about them. \"You'd think they'd resent\nour moving in on them,\" Jack Mario had said one day. \"After all, we\n_are_ usurpers. And they treat us like kings. Have you noticed the way\nthey mimic us? I saw one chewing tobacco the other day. He hated the\nstuff, but he chewed away, and spat like a trooper.\"\n\nOne of the Dusties had been sitting on Pete's knee when Captain Varga\nhad been talking, and he had known that something terrible was wrong.\nNow he sat on the desk in the office, moving uneasily back and forth as\nPete looked up at Mario's dark face, and then across at John Tegan and\nMel Dorfman. John's face was dark with anger as he ran his fingers\nthrough the heavy gray beard that fell to his chest. Mel sat stunned,\nshaking his head helplessly. Mario was unable to restrain himself. His\nface was bitter as he stomped across the room, then returned to shake\nhis fist under Pete's nose. \"But did you see him?\" he choked. \"Governor\nof the colony! What does he know about growing _taaro_ in this kind of\nsoil? Did you see those hands? Soft, dainty, pink! How could a man with\nhands like that govern a colony?\"\n\nPete looked over at John Tegan. \"Well, John?\"\n\nThe big man looked up, his eyes hollow under craggy brows. \"It's below\nthe belt, Pete. But if the government's been overthrown, then the\ncaptain is right. It leaves us out on a limb.\"\n\nPete shook his head. \"_I_ can't give him an answer,\" he said. \"The\nanswer has got to come from the colony. All I can do is speak for the\ncolony.\"\n\nTegan stared at the floor. \"We're an Earth colony,\" he said softly. \"I\nknow that. I was born in New York. I lived there for many years. But\nEarth isn't my home any more. This is.\" He looked at Pete. \"I built it,\nand so did you. All of us built it, even when things were getting stormy\nback home. Maybe that's why we came, maybe somehow we saw the\nhandwriting on the wall.\"\n\n\"But when did it happen?\" Mel burst out suddenly. \"How could _anything_\nso big happen so fast?\"\n\n\"Speed was the secret,\" Pete said gloomily. \"It was quick, it was well\norganized, and the government was unstable. We're just caught in the\nedge of it. Pity the ones living there, now. But the new government\nconsiders the colonies as areas for exploitation instead of\ndevelopment.\"\n\n\"Well, they can't do it,\" Mario cried. \"This is _our_ land, _our_ home.\nNobody can tell us what to grow in our fields.\"\n\nPete's fist slammed down on the desk. \"Well, how are you going to stop\nthem? The law of the land is sitting out there in that ship. Tomorrow\nmorning he's coming back here to install his fat little friend as\ngovernor. He has guns and soldiers on that ship to back him up. What are\nyou going to do about it?\"\n\n\"Fight it,\" Mario said.\n\n\"How?\"\n\nJack Mario looked around the room. \"There are only a dozen men on that\nship,\" he said softly. \"We've got seventy-four. When Varga comes back to\nthe village tomorrow, we tell him to take his friend back to the ship\nand shove off. We give him five minutes to get turned around, and if he\ndoesn't, we start shooting.\"\n\n\"Just one little thing,\" said Pete quietly. \"What about the supplies?\nEven if we fought them off and won, what about the food, the clothing,\nthe replacement parts for the machines?\"\n\n\"We don't need machinery to farm this land,\" said Mario eagerly.\n\"There's food here, food we can live on; the Dusties showed us that the\nfirst winter. And we can farm the land for our own use and let the\nmachinery rust. There's nothing they can bring us from Earth that we\ncan't do without.\"\n\n\"We couldn't get away with it!\" Mel Dorfman shook his head bitterly.\n\"You're asking us to cut ourselves off from Earth completely. But they'd\nnever let us. They'd send ships to bomb us out.\"\n\n\"We could hide, and rebuild after they had finished.\"\n\nPete Farnam sighed. \"They'd never leave us alone, Jack. Didn't you see\nthat captain? His kind of mind can't stand opposition. We'd just be a\nthorn in the side of the new Earth Government. They don't want _any_\nfree colonies.\"\n\n\"Well, let's give them one.\" Mario sat down tiredly, snapping his\nfingers at the Dustie. \"Furs!\" he snarled. He looked up, his dark eyes\nburning. \"It's no good, Pete. We can't let them get away with it.\nProduce for them, yes. Try to raise the yield for them, yes. But not a\ngovernor. If they insist on that we can throw them out, and keep them\nout.\"\n\n\"I don't think so. They'd kill every one of us first.\"\n\nJohn Tegan sat up, and looked Pete Farnam straight in the eye. \"In that\ncase, Peter, it might just be better if they did.\"\n\nPete stared at him for a moment and slowly stood up. \"All right,\" he\nsaid. \"Call a general colony meeting. We'll see what the women think.\nThen we'll make our plans.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ship's jeep skidded to a halt in a cloud of dust. Captain Varga\npeered through the windshield. Then he stood up, staring at the three\nmen blocking the road at the edge of the village. The little pink-faced\nman at his side turned white when he saw their faces, and his fingers\nbegan to tremble. Each of the men had a gun.\n\n\"You'd better clear the road,\" the captain snapped. \"We're driving\nthrough.\"\n\nPete Farnam stepped forward. He pointed to Nathan. \"Take your friend\nthere back to the ship. Leave him there. We don't want him here.\"\n\nNathan turned to Varga. \"I told you,\" he said viciously. \"Too big for\ntheir boots. Go on through.\"\n\nThe captain laughed and gunned the motor, started straight for the men\nblocking the road. Then Jack Mario shot a hole in his front tire. The\njeep lurched to a stop. Captain Varga stood up, glaring at the men.\n\"Farnam, step out here,\" he said.\n\n\"You heard us,\" Pete said, without moving. \"Crops, yes. We'll try to\nincrease our yield. But no overseer. Leave him here and we'll kill him.\"\n\n\"Once more,\" said the captain, \"clear the way. This man is your new\ngovernor. He will be regarded as the official agent of the Earth\nGovernment until the final production capacity of this colony is\ndetermined. Now clear out.\"\n\nThe men didn't move. Without another word, the captain threw the jeep\ninto reverse, jerked back in a curve, and started the jeep, flat tire\nand all, back toward the ship in a billow of dust.\n\nAbruptly the village exploded into activity. Four men took up places\nbehind the row of windbreaks beyond the first row of cabins. Pete turned\nand ran back into the village. He found John Tegan commandeering a\nsquad of ten dirty-faced men. \"Are the women and children all out?\" he\nshouted.\n\n\"All taken care of.\" Tegan spat tobacco juice, and wiped his mouth with\nthe back of his hand.\n\n\"Where's Mel?\"\n\n\"Left flank. He'll try to move in behind them. Gonna be tough, Pete,\nthey've got good weapons.\"\n\n\"What about the boys last night?\"\n\nJohn was checking the bolt on his ancient rifle. \"Hank and Ringo? Just\ngot back an hour ago. If Varga wants to get his surface planes into\naction, he's going to have to dismantle them and rebuild them outside.\nThe boys jammed up the launching ports for good.\" He spat again. \"Don't\nworry, Pete. This is going to be a ground fight.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Pete held out his hand to the old man. \"This may be it. And if\nwe turn them back, there's bound to be more later.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of planet to hide on,\" said Tegan. \"They may come back,\nbut after a while they'll go again.\"\n\nPete nodded. \"I just hope we'll still be here when they do.\"\n\nThey waited. It seemed like hours. Pete moved from post to post among\nthe men, heavy-faced men he had known all his life, it seemed. They\nwaited with whatever weapons they had available--pistols, home-made\nrevolvers, ortho-guns, an occasional rifle, even knives and clubs.\nPete's heart sank. They were bitter men, but they were a mob with no\norganization, no training for fighting. They would be facing a dozen of\nSecurity's best-disciplined shock troops, armed with the latest weapons\nfrom Earth's electronics laboratories. The colonists didn't stand a\nchance.\n\nPete got his rifle and made his way up the rise of ground overlooking\nthe right flank of the village. Squinting, he could spot the cloud of\ndust rising up near the glistening ship, moving toward the village. And\nthen, for the first time, he realized that he hadn't seen any Dusties\nall day.\n\nIt puzzled him. They had been in the village in abundance an hour before\ndawn, while the plans were being laid out. He glanced around, hoping to\nsee one of the fuzzy brown forms at his elbow, but he saw nothing. And\nthen, as he stared at the cloud of dust coming across the valley, he\nthought he saw the ground moving.\n\nHe blinked, and rubbed his eyes. With a gasp he dragged out his\nbinoculars and peered down at the valley floor. There were thousands of\nthem, hundreds of thousands, their brown bodies moving slowly out from\nthe hills surrounding the village, converging into a broad, liquid\ncolumn between the village and the ship. Even as he watched, the column\ngrew thicker, like a heavy blanket being drawn across the road, a\nmultitude of Dusties lining up.\n\nPete's hair prickled on the back of his neck. They knew so little about\nthe creatures, so _very_ little. As he watched the brown carpet rolling\nout, he tried to think. Could there be a weapon in their hands, could\nthey somehow have perceived the evil that came from the ship, somehow\nsensed the desperation in the men's voices as they had laid their plans?\nPete stared, a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. They were\nthere in the road, thousands upon thousands of them, standing there,\nwaiting--for what?\n\nThree columns of dust were coming from the road now. Through the glasses\nPete could see the jeeps, filled with men in their gleaming gray\nuniforms, crash helmets tight about their heads, blasters glistening in\nthe pale light. They moved in deadly convoy along the rutted road,\ncloser and closer to the crowd of Dusties overflowing the road.\n\nThe Dusties just stood there. They didn't move. They didn't shift, or\nturn. They just waited.\n\nThe captain's car was first in line. He pulled up before the line with a\nscreech of brakes, and stared at the sea of creatures before him. \"Get\nout of there!\" he shouted.\n\nThe Dusties didn't move.\n\nThe captain turned to his men. \"Fire into them,\" he snapped. \"Clear a\npath.\"\n\nThere was a blaze of fire, and a half a dozen Dusties slid to the\nground, convulsing. Pete felt a chill pass through him, staring in\ndisbelief. The Dusties had a weapon, he kept telling himself, they\n_must_ have a weapon, something the colonists had never dreamed of. The\nguns came up again, and another volley echoed across the valley, and a\ndozen more Dusties fell to the ground. For every one that fell, another\nmoved stolidly into its place.\n\nWith a curse the captain sat down in the seat, gunned the motor, and\nstarted forward. The jeep struck the fallen bodies, rolled over them,\nand plunged straight into the wall of Dusties. Still they didn't move.\nThe car slowed and stopped, mired down. The other cars picked up\nmomentum and plunged into the brown river of creatures. They too ground\nto a stop.\n\nThe captain started roaring at his men. \"Cut them down! We're going to\nget through here!\" Blasters began roaring into the faces of the Dusties,\nand as they fell the jeeps moved forward a few feet until more of the\ncreatures blocked their path.\n\nPete heard a cry below him, and saw Jack Mario standing in the road, gun\non the ground, hands out in front of him, staring in horror as the\nDusties kept moving into the fire. \"Do you see what they're doing!\" he\nscreamed. \"They'll be slaughtered, every one of them!\" And then he was\nrunning down the road, shouting at them to stop, and so were Pete and\nTegan and the rest of the men.\n\nSomething hit Pete in the shoulder as he ran. He spun around and fell\ninto the dusty road. A dozen Dusties closed in around him, lifted him up\nbodily, and started back through the village with him. He tried to\nstruggle, but vaguely he saw that the other men were being carried back\nalso, while the river of brown creatures held the jeeps at bay. The\nDusties were hurrying, half carrying and half dragging him back through\nthe village and up a long ravine into the hills beyond. At last they\nset Pete on his feet again, plucking urgently at his shirt sleeve as\nthey hurried him along.\n\nHe followed them willingly, then, with the rest of the colonists at his\nheels. He didn't know what the Dusties were doing, but he knew they were\ntrying to save him. Finally they reached a cave, a great cleft in the\nrock that Pete knew for certain had not been there when he had led\nexploring parties through these hills years before. It was a huge\nopening, and already a dozen of the men were there, waiting, dazed by\nwhat they had witnessed down in the valley, while more were stumbling up\nthe rocky incline, tugged along by the fuzzy brown creatures.\n\nInside the cavern, steps led down the side of the rock, deep into the\ndark coolness of the earth. Down and down they went, until they suddenly\nfound themselves in a mammoth room lit by blazing torches. Pete stopped\nand stared at his friends who had already arrived. Jack Mario was\nsitting on the floor, his face in his hands, sobbing. Tegan was sitting,\ntoo, blinking at Pete as if he were a stranger, and Dorfman was\ntrembling like a leaf. Pete stared about him through the dim light, and\nthen looked where Tegan was pointing at the end of the room.\n\nHe couldn't see it clearly, at first. Finally, he made out a raised\nplatform with four steps leading up. A torch lighted either side of a\ndais at the top, and between the torches, rising high into the gloom,\nstood a statue.\n\nIt was a beautifully carved thing, hewn from the heavy granite that made\nup the core of this planet, with the same curious styling as other\ncarving the Dusties had done. The design was intricate, the lines\ncarefully turned and polished. At first Pete thought it was a statue of\na Dustie, but when he moved forward and squinted in the dim light, he\nsuddenly realized that it was something else indeed. And in that moment\nhe realized why they were there and why the Dusties had done this\nincredible thing to protect them.\n\nThe statue was weirdly beautiful, the work of a dedicated master\nsculptor. It was a figure, standing with five-fingered hands on hips,\nhead raised high. Not a portrait, but an image seen through other eyes\nthan human, standing high in the room with the lights burning reverently\nat its feet.\n\nUnmistakably it was the statue of a man.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey heard the bombs, much later. The granite roof and floor of the\ncavern trembled, and the men and women stared at each other, helpless\nand sick as they huddled in that great hall. But presently the bombing\nstopped. Later, when they stumbled out of that grotto into the late\nafternoon light, the ship was gone.\n\nThey knew it would be back. Possibly it would bring back search parties\nto hunt down the rebels in the hills; perhaps it would just wait and\nagain bomb out the new village when it rose. But searching parties would\nnever find their quarry, and the village would rise again and again, if\nnecessary.\n\nAnd in the end, somehow, Pete knew that the colonists would find a way\nto survive here and live free as they had always lived. It might be a\nbitter struggle, but no matter how hard the fight, there would be one\nstrange and wonderful thing they could count on.\n\nNo matter what they had to do, he knew the Dusties would help them.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Image of the Gods, by Alan Edward Nourse\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK IMAGE OF THE GODS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 22882.txt or 22882.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/2/8/8/22882/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Stephen Blundell and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
