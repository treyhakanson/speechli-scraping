Up in the\ncontrol room, Irene had been told, the needles of the dials danced\nagainst the red danger lines day and night.\n\nShe lay in bed and listened to the muffled, ceaseless roar of the drives\nand felt the singing vibration of the hull. _We should be almost safe by\nnow_, she thought. _Athena is only forty days away._\n\nThinking of the new life awaiting them all made her too restless to lie\nstill any longer. She got up, to sit on the edge of the bed and switch\non the light. Dale was gone--he had been summoned to adjust one of the\nmachines in the ship's X-ray room--and Billy was asleep, nothing showing\nof him above the covers but a crop of brown hair and the furry nose of\nhis ragged teddy bear.\n\nShe reached out to straighten the covers, gently, so as not to awaken\nhim. It happened then, the thing they had all feared.\n\nFrom the stern of the ship came a jarring, deafening explosion. The ship\nlurched violently, girders screamed, and the light flicked out.\n\nIn the darkness she heard a rapid-fire _thunk-thunk-thunk_ as the\nautomatic guard system slid inter-compartment doors shut against\nsections of the ship suddenly airless. The doors were still thudding\nshut when another explosion came, from toward the bow. Then there was\nsilence; a feeling of utter quiet and motionlessness.\n\nThe fingers of fear enclosed her and her mind said to her, like the\ncold, unpassionate voice of a stranger: _The Gerns have found us._\n\nThe light came on again, a feeble glow, and there was the soft, muffled\nsound of questioning voices in the other compartments. She dressed, her\nfingers shaking and clumsy, wishing that Dale would come to reassure\nher; to tell her that nothing really serious had happened, that it had\nnot been the Gerns.\n\nIt was very still in the little compartment--strangely so. She had\nfinished dressing when she realized the reason: the air circulation\nsystem had stopped working.\n\nThat meant the power failure was so great that the air regenerators,\nthemselves, were dead. And there were eight thousand people on the\n_Constellation_ who would have to have air to live....\n\nThe _Attention_ buzzer sounded shrilly from the public address system\nspeakers that were scattered down the ship's corridors. A voice she\nrecognized as that of Lieutenant Commander Lake spoke:\n\n\"War was declared upon Earth by the Gern Empire ten days ago. Two Gern\ncruisers have attacked us and their blasters have destroyed the stern\nand bow of the ship. We are without a drive and without power but for a\nfew emergency batteries. I am the _Constellation_'s only surviving\nofficer and the Gern commander is boarding us to give me the surrender\nterms.\n\n\"None of you will leave your compartments until ordered to do so.\nWherever you may be, remain there. This is necessary to avoid confusion\nand to have as many as possible in known locations for future\ninstructions. I repeat: you will not leave your compartments.\"\n\nThe speaker cut off. She stood without moving and heard again the words:\n_I am the _Constellation_'s only surviving officer...._\n\nThe Gerns had killed her father.\n\nHe had been second-in-command of the Dunbar expedition that had\ndiscovered the world of Athena and his knowledge of Athena was valuable\nto the colonization plans. He had been quartered among the ship's\nofficers--and the Gern blast had destroyed that section of the ship.\n\nShe sat down on the edge of the bed again and tried to reorient herself;\nto accept the fact that her life and the lives of all the others had\nabruptly, irrevocably, been changed.\n\nThe Athena Colonization Plan was ended. They had known such a thing\nmight happen--that was why the _Constellation_ had been made ready for\nthe voyage in secret and had waited for months for the chance to slip\nthrough the ring of Gern spy ships; that was why she had raced at full\nspeed, with her communicators silenced so there would be no radiations\nfor the Gerns to find her by. Only forty days more would have brought\nthem to the green and virgin world of Athena, four hundred light-years\nbeyond the outermost boundary of the Gern Empire. There they should have\nbeen safe from Gern detection for many years to come; for long enough to\nbuild planetary defenses against attack. And there they would have used\nAthena's rich resources to make ships and weapons to defend\nmineral-depleted Earth against the inexorably increasing inclosure of\nthe mighty, coldly calculating colossus that was the Gern Empire.\n\nSuccess or failure of the Athena Plan had meant ultimate life or death\nfor Earth. They had taken every precaution possible but the Gern spy\nsystem had somehow learned of Athena and the _Constellation_. Now, the\ncold war was no longer cold and the Plan was dust....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBilly sighed and stirred in the little-boy sleep that had not been\nbroken by the blasts that had altered the lives of eight thousand people\nand the fate of a world.\n\nShe shook his shoulder and said, \"Billy.\"\n\nHe raised up, so small and young to her eyes that the question in her\nmind was like an anguished prayer: _Dear God--what do Gerns do to\nfive-year-old boys?_\n\nHe saw her face, and the dim light, and the sleepiness was suddenly gone\nfrom him. \"What's wrong, Mama? And why are you scared?\"\n\nThere was no reason to lie to him.\n\n\"The Gerns found us and stopped us.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he said. In his manner was the grave thoughtfulness of a boy twice\nhis age, as there always was. \"Will they--will they kill us?\"\n\n\"Get dressed, honey,\" she said. \"Hurry, so we'll be ready when they let\nDaddy come back to tell us what to do.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were both ready when the _Attention_ buzzer sounded again in the\ncorridors. Lake spoke, his tone grim and bitter:\n\n\"There is no power for the air regenerators and within twenty hours we\nwill start smothering to death. Under these circumstances I could not do\nother than accept the survival terms the Gern commander offered us.\n\n\"He will speak to you now and you will obey his orders without protest.\nDeath is the only alternative.\"\n\nThen the voice of the Gern commander came, quick and harsh and brittle:\n\n\"This section of space, together with planet Athena, is an extension of\nthe Gern Empire. This ship has deliberately invaded Gern territory in\ntime of war with intent to seize and exploit a Gern world. We are\nwilling, however, to offer a leniency not required by the circumstances.\nTerran technicians and skilled workers in certain fields can be used in\nthe factories we shall build on Athena. The others will not be needed\nand there is not room on the cruisers to take them.\n\n\"Your occupation records will be used to divide you into two groups: the\nAcceptables and the Rejects. The Rejects will be taken by the cruisers\nto an Earth-type planet near here and left, together with the personal\npossessions in their compartments and additional, and ample, supplies.\nThe Acceptables will then be taken on to Athena and at a later date the\ncruisers will return the Rejects to Earth.\n\n\"This division will split families but there will be no resistance to it.\nGern guards will be sent immediately to make this division and you will\nwait in your compartments for them. You will obey their orders promptly\nand without annoying them with questions. At the first instance of\nresistance or rebellion this offer will be withdrawn and the cruisers\nwill go their way again.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the silence following the ultimatum she could hear the soft, wordless\nmurmur from the other compartments, the undertone of anxiety like a dark\nthread through it. In every compartment parents and children, brothers\nand sisters, were seeing one another for the last time....\n\nThe corridor outside rang to the tramp of feet; the sound of a dozen\nGerns walking with swift military precision. She held her breath, her\nheart racing, but they went past her door and on to the corridor's end.\n\nThere she could faintly hear them entering compartments, demanding\nnames, and saying, _\"Out--out!\"_ Once she heard a Gern say, \"Acceptables\nwill remain inside until further notice. Do not open your doors after\nthe Rejects have been taken out.\"\n\nBilly touched her on the hand. \"Isn't Daddy going to come?\"\n\n\"He--he can't right now. We'll see him pretty soon.\"\n\nShe remembered what the Gern commander had said about the Rejects being\npermitted to take their personal possessions. She had very little time\nin which to get together what she could carry....\n\nThere were two small bags in the compartment and she hurried to pack\nthem with things she and Dale and Billy might need, not able to know\nwhich of them, if any, would be Rejects. Nor could she know whether she\nshould put in clothes for a cold world or a hot one. The Gern commander\nhad said the Rejects would be left on an Earth-type planet but where\ncould it be? The Dunbar Expedition had explored across five hundred\nlight-years of space and had found only one Earth-type world: Athena.\n\nThe Gerns were almost to her door when she had finished and she heard\nthem enter the compartments across from her own. There came the hard,\ncurt questions and the command: \"Outside--hurry!\" A woman said something\nin pleading question and there was the soft thud of a blow and the\nwords: \"Outside--do not ask questions!\" A moment later she heard the\nwoman going down the corridor, trying to hold back her crying.\n\nThen the Gerns were at her own door.\n\nShe held Billy's hand and waited for them with her heart hammering. She\nheld her head high and composed herself with all the determination she\ncould muster so that the arrogant Gerns would not see that she was\nafraid. Billy stood beside her as tall as his five years would permit,\nhis teddy bear under his arm, and only the way his hand held to hers\nshowed that he, too, was scared.\n\nThe door was flung open and two Gerns strode in.\n\nThe were big, dark men, with powerful, bulging muscles. They surveyed\nher and the room with a quick sweep of eyes that were like glittering\nobsidian, their mouths thin, cruel slashes in the flat, brutal planes of\ntheir faces.\n\n\"Your name?\" snapped the one who carried a sheaf of occupation records.\n\n\"It's\"--she tried to swallow the quaver in her voice and make it cool\nand unfrightened--\"Irene Lois Humbolt--Mrs. Dale Humbolt.\"\n\nThe Gern glanced at the papers. \"Where is your husband?\"\n\n\"He was in the X-ray room at--\"\n\n\"You are a Reject. Out--down the corridor with the others.\"\n\n\"My husband--will he be a--\"\n\n_\"Outside!\"_\n\nIt was the tone of voice that had preceded the blow in the other\ncompartment and the Gern took a quick step toward her. She seized the\ntwo bags in one hand, not wanting to release Billy, and swung back to\nhurry out into the corridor. The other Gern jerked one of the bags from\nher hand and flung it to the floor. \"Only one bag per person,\" he said,\nand gave her an impatient shove that sent her and Billy stumbling\nthrough the doorway.\n\nShe became part of the Rejects who were being herded like sheep down the\ncorridors and into the port airlock. There were many children among\nthem, the young ones frightened and crying, and often with only one\nparent or an older brother or sister to take care of them. And there\nwere many young ones who had no one at all and were dependent upon\nstrangers to take their hands and tell them what they must do.\n\nWhen she was passing the corridor that led to the X-ray room she saw a\ngroup of Rejects being herded up it. Dale was not among them and she\nknew, then, that she and Billy would never see him again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_\"Out from the ship--faster--faster----\"_\n\nThe commands of the Gern guards snapped like whips around them as she\nand the other Rejects crowded and stumbled down the boarding ramp and\nout onto the rocky ground. There was the pull of a terrible gravity such\nas she had never experienced and they were in a bleak, barren valley, a\ncold wind moaning down it and whipping the alkali dust in bitter clouds.\nAround the valley stood ragged hills, their white tops laying out\nstreamers of wind-driven snow, and the sky was dark with sunset.\n\n_\"Out from the ship--faster----\"_\n\nIt was hard to walk fast in the high gravity, carrying the bag in one\nhand and holding up all of Billy's weight she could with the other.\n\n\"They lied to us!\" a man beside her said to someone. \"Let's turn and\nfight. Let's take----\"\n\nA Gern blaster cracked with a vivid blue flash and the man plunged\nlifelessly to the ground. She flinched instinctively and fell over an\nunseen rock, the bag of precious clothes flying from her hand. She\nscrambled up again, her left knee half numb, and turned to retrieve it.\n\nThe Gern guard was already upon her, his blaster still in his hand. \"Out\nfrom the ship--faster.\"\n\nThe barrel of his blaster lashed across the side of her head. \"Move\non--move on!\"\n\nShe staggered in a blinding blaze of pain and then hurried on, holding\ntight to Billy's hand, the wind cutting like knives of ice through her\nthin clothes and blood running in a trickle down her cheek.\n\n\"He hit you,\" Billy said. \"He hurt you.\" Then he called the Gern a name\nthat five-year-old boys were not supposed to know, with a savagery that\nfive-year-old boys were not supposed to possess.\n\nWhen she stopped at the outer fringe of Rejects she saw that all of them\nwere out of the cruiser and the guards were going back into it. A half\nmile down the valley the other cruiser stood, the Rejects out from it\nand its boarding ramps already withdrawn.\n\nWhen she had buttoned Billy's blouse tighter and wiped the blood from\nher face the first blast of the drives came from the farther cruiser.\nThe nearer one blasted a moment later and they lifted together, their\nroaring filling the valley. They climbed faster and faster, dwindling as\nthey went. Then they disappeared in the black sky, their roaring faded\naway, and there was left only the moaning of the wind around her and\nsomewhere a child crying.\n\nAnd somewhere a voice asking, \"Where are we? In the name of God--what\nhave they done to us?\"\n\nShe looked at the snow streaming from the ragged hills, felt the hard\npull of the gravity, and knew where they were. They were on Ragnarok,\nthe hell-world of 1.5 gravity and fierce beasts and raging fevers where\nmen could not survive. The name came from an old Teutonic myth and\nmeant: _The last day for gods and men_. The Dunbar Expedition had\ndiscovered Ragnarok and her father had told her of it, of how it had\nkilled six of the eight men who had left the ship and would have killed\nall of them if they had remained any longer.\n\nShe knew where they were and she knew the Gerns had lied to them and\nwould never send a ship to take them to Earth. Their abandonment there\nhad been intended as a death sentence for all of them.\n\nAnd Dale was gone and she and Billy would die helpless and alone....\n\n\"It will be dark--so soon.\" Billy's voice shook with the cold. \"If Daddy\ncan't find us in the dark, what will we do?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said. \"There's no one to help us and how can I\nknow--what we should do----\"\n\nShe was from the city. How could she know what to do on an alien,\nhostile world where armed explorers had died? She had tried to be brave\nbefore the Gerns but now--now night was at hand and out of it would\ncome terror and death for herself and Billy. They would never see Dale\nagain, never see Athena or Earth or even the dawn on the world that had\nkilled them....\n\nShe tried not to cry, and failed. Billy's cold little hand touched her\nown, trying to reassure her.\n\n\"Don't cry, Mama. I guess--I guess everybody else is scared, too.\"\n\n_Everyone else...._\n\nShe was not alone. How could she have thought she was alone? All around\nher were others, as helpless and uncertain as she. Her story was only\none out of four thousand.\n\n\"I guess they are, Billy,\" she said. \"I never thought of that, before.\"\n\nShe knelt to put her arms around him, thinking: _Tears and fear are\nfutile weapons; they can never bring us any tomorrows. We'll have to\nfight whatever comes to kill us no matter how scared we are. For\nourselves and for our children. Above all else, for our children...._\n\n\"I'm going back to find our clothes,\" she said. \"You wait here for me,\nin the shelter of that rock, and I won't be gone long.\"\n\nThen she told him what he would be too young to really understand.\n\n\"I'm not going to cry any more and I know, now, what I must do. I'm\ngoing to make sure that there is a tomorrow for you, always, to the last\nbreath of my life.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bright blue star dimmed and the others faded away. Dawn touched the\nsky, bringing with it a coldness that frosted the steel of the rifle in\nJohn Prentiss's hands and formed beads of ice on his gray mustache.\nThere was a stirring in the area behind him as the weary Rejects\nprepared to face the new day and the sound of a child whimpering from\nthe cold. There had been no time the evening before to gather wood for\nfires----\n\n_\"Prowlers!\"_\n\nThe warning cry came from an outer guard and black shadows were suddenly\nsweeping out of the dark dawn.\n\nThey were things that might have been half wolf, half tiger; each of\nthem three hundred pounds of incredible ferocity with eyes blazing like\nyellow fire in their white-fanged tiger-wolf faces. They came like the\nwind, in a flowing black wave, and ripped through the outer guard line\nas though it had not existed. The inner guards fired in a chattering\nroll of gunshots, trying to turn them, and Prentiss's rifle licked out\npale tongues of flame as he added his own fire. The prowlers came on,\nbreaking through, but part of them went down and the others were swerved\nby the fire so that they struck only the outer edge of the area where\nthe Rejects were grouped.\n\nAt that distance they blended into the dark ground so that he could not\nfind them in the sights of his rifle. He could only watch helplessly and\nsee a dark-haired woman caught in their path, trying to run with a child\nin her arms and already knowing it was too late. A man was running\ntoward her, slow in the high gravity, an axe in his hands and his\ncursing a raging, savage snarl. For a moment her white face was turned\nin helpless appeal to him and the others; then the prowlers were upon\nher and she fell, deliberately, going to the ground with her child\nhugged in her arms beneath her so that her body would protect it.\n\nThe prowlers passed over her, pausing for an instant to slash the life\nfrom her, and raced on again. They vanished back into the outer\ndarkness, the farther guards firing futilely, and there was a silence\nbut for the distant, hysterical sobbing of a woman.\n\nIt had happened within seconds; the fifth prowler attack that night and\nthe mildest.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFull dawn had come by the time he replaced the guards killed by the last\nattack and made the rounds of the other guard lines. He came back by the\nplace where the prowlers had killed the woman, walking wearily against\nthe pull of gravity. She lay with her dark hair tumbled and stained with\nblood, her white face turned up to the reddening sky, and he saw her\nclearly for the first time.\n\nIt was Irene.\n\nHe stopped, gripping the cold steel of the rifle and not feeling the\nrear sight as it cut into his hand.\n\nIrene.... He had not known she was on Ragnarok. He had not seen her in\nthe darkness of the night and he had hoped she and Billy were safe among\nthe Acceptables with Dale.\n\nThere was the sound of footsteps and a bold-faced girl in a red skirt\nstopped beside him, her glance going over him curiously.\n\n\"The little boy,\" he asked, \"do you know if he's all right?\"\n\n\"The prowlers cut up his face but he'll be all right,\" she said. \"I came\nback after his clothes.\"\n\n\"Are you going to look after him?\"\n\n\"Someone has to and\"--she shrugged her shoulders--\"I guess I was soft\nenough to elect myself for the job. Why--was his mother a friend of\nyours?\"\n\n\"She was my daughter,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh.\" For a moment the bold, brassy look was gone from her face, like a\nmask that had slipped. \"I'm sorry. And I'll take care of Billy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first objection to his assumption of leadership occurred an hour\nlater. The prowlers had withdrawn with the coming of full daylight and\nwood had been carried from the trees to build fires. Mary, one of the\nvolunteer cooks, was asking two men to carry her some water when he\napproached. The smaller man picked up one of the clumsy containers,\nhastily improvised from canvas, and started toward the creek. The other,\na big, thick-chested man, did not move.\n\n\"We'll have to have water,\" Mary said. \"People are hungry and cold and\nsick.\"\n\nThe man continued to squat by the fire, his hands extended to its\nwarmth. \"Name someone else,\" he said.\n\n\"But----\"\n\nShe looked at Prentiss in uncertainty. He went to the thick-chested man,\nknowing there would be violence and welcoming it as something to help\ndrive away the vision of Irene's pale, cold face under the red sky.\n\n\"She asked you to get her some water,\" he said. \"Get it.\"\n\nThe man looked up at him, studying him with deliberate insolence, then\nhe got to his feet, his heavy shoulders hunched challengingly.\n\n\"I'll have to set you straight, old timer,\" he said. \"No one has\nappointed you the head cheese around here. Now, there's the container\nyou want filled and over there\"--he made a small motion with one\nhand--\"is the creek. Do you know what to do?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"I know what to do.\"\n\nHe brought the butt of the rifle smashing up. It struck the man under\nthe chin and there was a sharp cracking sound as his jawbone snapped.\nFor a fraction of a second there was an expression of stupefied\namazement on his face then his eyes glazed and he slumped to the ground\nwith his broken jaw setting askew.\n\n\"All right,\" he said to Mary. \"Now you go ahead and name somebody else.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe found that the prowlers had killed seventy during the night. One\nhundred more had died from the Hell Fever that often followed exposure\nand killed within an hour.\n\nHe went the half mile to the group that had arrived on the second\ncruiser as soon as he had eaten a delayed breakfast. He saw, before he\nhad quite reached the other group, that the _Constellation_'s Lieutenant\nCommander, Vincent Lake, was in charge of it.\n\nLake, a tall, hard-jawed man with pale blue eyes under pale brows,\nwalked forth to meet him as soon as he recognized him.\n\n\"Glad to see you're still alive,\" Lake greeted him. \"I thought that\nsecond Gern blast got you along with the others.\"\n\n\"I was visiting midship and wasn't home when it happened,\" he said.\n\nHe looked at Lake's group of Rejects, in their misery and uncertainty so\nmuch like his own, and asked, \"How was it last night?\"\n\n\"Bad--damned bad,\" Lake said. \"Prowlers and Hell Fever, and no wood for\nfires. Two hundred died last night.\"\n\n\"I came down to see if anyone was in charge here and to tell them that\nwe'll have to move into the woods at once--today. We'll have plenty of\nwood for the fires there, some protection from the wind, and by\ncombining our defenses we can stand off the prowlers better.\"\n\nLake agreed. When the brief discussion of plans was finished he asked,\n\"How much do you know about Ragnarok?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" Prentiss answered. \"We didn't stay to study it very long.\nThere are no heavy metals on Ragnarok's other sun. Its position in the\nadvance of the resources of any value. We gave Ragnarok a quick survey\nand when the sixth man died we marked it on the chart as uninhabitable\nand went on our way.\n\n\"As you probably know, that bright blue star is Ragnarok's other sun.\nIt's position in the advance of the yellow sun shows the season to be\nearly spring. When summer comes Ragnarok will swing between the two suns\nand the heat will be something no human has ever endured. Nor the cold,\nwhen winter comes.\n\n\"I know of no edible plants, although there might be some. There are a\nfew species of rodent-like animals--they're scavengers--and a herbivore\nwe called the woods goat. The prowlers are the dominant form of life on\nRagnarok and I suspect their intelligence is a good deal higher than we\nwould like it to be. There will be a constant battle for survival with\nthem.\n\n\"There's another animal, not as intelligent as the prowlers but just as\ndangerous--the unicorn. The unicorns are big and fast and they travel in\nherds. I haven't seen any here so far--I hope we don't. At the lower\nelevations are the swamp crawlers. They're unadulterated nightmares. I\nhope they don't go to these higher elevations in the summer. The\nprowlers and the Hell Fever, the gravity and heat and cold and\nstarvation, will be enough for us to have to fight.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Lake said. He smiled, a smile that was as bleak as moonlight on\nan arctic glacier. \"Earth-type--remember the promise the Gerns made the\nRejects?\" He looked out across the camp, at the snow whipping from the\nfrosty hills, at the dead and the dying, and a little girl trying vainly\nto awaken her brother.\n\n\"They were condemned, without reason, without a chance to live,\" he\nsaid. \"So many of them are so young ... and when you're young it's too\nsoon to have to die.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPrentiss returned to his own group. The dead were buried in shallow\ngraves and inventory was taken of the promised \"ample supplies.\" These\nwere only the few personal possessions the Rejects had been permitted to\ntake plus a small amount of food the Gerns had taken from the\n_Constellation_'s stores. The Gerns had been forced to provide the\nRejects with at least a little food--had they openly left them to\nstarve, the Acceptables, whose families were among the Rejects, might\nhave rebelled.\n\nInventory of the firearms and ammunition showed the total to be\ndiscouragingly small. They would have to learn how to make and use bows\nand arrows as soon as possible.\n\nWith the first party of guards and workmen following him, Prentiss went\nto the tributary valley that emptied into the central valley a mile to\nthe north. It was as good a camp site as could be hoped for; wide and\nthickly spotted with groves of trees, a creek running down its center.\n\nThe workmen began the construction of shelters and he climbed up the\nside of the nearer hill. He reached its top, his breath coming fast in\nthe gravity that was the equivalent of a burden half his own weight, and\nsaw what the surrounding terrain was like.\n\nTo the south, beyond the barren valley, the land could be seen dropping\nin its long sweep to the southern lowlands where the unicorns and swamp\ncrawlers lived. To the north the hills climbed gently for miles, then\nended under the steeply sloping face of an immense plateau. The plateau\nreached from western to eastern horizon, still white with the snows of\nwinter and looming so high above the world below that the clouds brushed\nit and half obscured it.\n\nHe went back down the hill as Lake's men appeared. They started work on\nwhat would be a continuation of his own camp and he told Lake what he\nhad seen from the hill.\n\n\"We're between the lowlands and the highlands,\" he said. \"This will be\nas near to a temperate altitude as Ragnarok has. We survive here--or\nelse. There's no other place for us to go.\"\n\nAn overcast darkened the sky at noon and the wind died down to almost\nnothing. There was a feeling of waiting tension in the air and he went\nback to the Rejects, to speed their move into the woods. They were\nalready going in scattered groups, accompanied by prowler guards, but\nthere was no organization and it would be too long before the last of\nthem were safely in the new camp.\n\nHe could not be two places at once--he needed a subleader to oversee the\nmove of the Rejects and their possessions into the woods and their\nplacement after they got there.\n\nHe found the man he wanted already helping the Rejects get started: a\nthin, quiet man named Henry Anders who had fought well against the\nprowlers the night before, even though his determination had been\ngreater than his marksmanship. He was the type people instinctively\nliked and trusted; a good choice for the subleader whose job it would be\nto handle the multitude of details in camp while he, Prentiss, and a\nsecond subleader he would select, handled the defense of the camp and\nthe hunting.\n\n\"I don't like this overcast,\" he told Anders. \"Something's brewing. Get\neveryone moved and at work helping build shelters as soon as you can.\"\n\n\"I can have most of them there within an hour or two,\" Anders said.\n\"Some of the older people, though, will have to take it slow. This\ngravity--it's already getting the hearts of some of them.\"\n\n\"How are the children taking the gravity?\" he asked.\n\n\"The babies and the very young--it's hard to tell about them yet. But\nthe children from about four on up get tired quickly, go to sleep, and\nwhen they wake up they've sort of bounced back out of it.\"\n\n\"Maybe they can adapt to some extent to this gravity.\" He thought of\nwhat Lake had said that morning: _So many of them are so young ... and\nwhen you're young it's too soon to have to die._ \"Maybe the Gerns made a\nmistake--maybe Terran children aren't as easy to kill as they thought.\nIt's your job and mine and others to give the children the chance to\nprove the Gerns wrong.\"\n\nHe went his way again to pass by the place where Julia, the girl who had\nbecome Billy's foster-mother, was preparing to go to the new camp.\n\nIt was the second time for him to see Billy that morning. The first time\nBilly had still been stunned with grief, and at the sight of his\ngrandfather he had been unable to keep from breaking.\n\n\"The Gern hit her,\" he had sobbed, his torn face bleeding anew as it\ntwisted in crying. \"He hurt her, and Daddy was gone and then--and then\nthe other things killed her----\"\n\nBut now he had had a little time to accept what had happened and he was\nchanged. He was someone much older, almost a man, trapped for a while in\nthe body of a five-year-old boy.\n\n\"I guess this is all, Billy,\" Julia was saying as she gathered up her\nscanty possessions and Irene's bag. \"Get your teddy bear and we'll go.\"\n\nBilly went to his teddy bear and knelt down to pick it up. Then he\nstopped and said something that sounded like _\"No.\"_ He laid the teddy\nbear back down, wiping a little dust from its face as in a last gesture\nof farewell, and stood up to face Julia empty-handed.\n\n\"I don't think I'll want to play with my teddy bear any more,\" he said.\n\"I don't think I'll ever want to play at all anymore.\"\n\nThen he went to walk beside her, leaving his teddy bear lying on the\nground behind him and with it leaving forever the tears and laughter of\nchildhood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe overcast deepened, and at midafternoon dark storm clouds came\ndriving in from the west. Efforts were intensified to complete the move\nbefore the storm broke, both in his section of the camp and in Lake's.\nThe shelters would be of critical importance and they were being built\nof the materials most quickly available; dead limbs, brush, and the\nlimited amount of canvas and blankets the Rejects had. They would be\ninadequate protection but there was no time to build anything better.\n\nIt seemed only a few minutes until the black clouds were overhead,\nrolling and racing at an incredible velocity. With them came the deep\nroar of the high wind that drove them and the wind on the ground began\nto stir restlessly in response, like some monster awakening to the call\nof its kind.\n\nPrentiss knew already who he wanted as his other subleader. He found him\nhard at work helping build shelters; Howard Craig, a powerfully muscled\nman with a face as hard and grim as a cliff of granite. It had been\nCraig who had tried to save Irene from the prowlers that morning with\nonly an axe as a weapon.\n\nPrentiss knew him slightly--and Craig still did not know Irene had been\nhis daughter. Craig had been one of the field engineers for what would\nhave been the Athena Geological Survey. He had had a wife, a frail,\nblonde girl who had been the first of all to die of Hell Fever the night\nbefore, and he still had their three small children.\n\n\"We'll stop with the shelters we already have built,\" he told Craig. \"It\nwill take all the time left to us to reinforce them against the wind. I\nneed someone to help me, in addition to Anders. You're the one I want.\n\n\"Send some young and fast-moving men back to last night's camp to cut\nall the strips of prowler skins they can get. Everything about the\nshelters will have to be lashed down to something solid. See if you can\nfind some experienced outdoorsmen to help you check the jobs.\n\n\"And tell Anders that women and children only will be placed in the\nshelters. There will be no room for anyone else and if any man, no\nmatter what the excuse, crowds out a woman or child I'll personally kill\nhim.\"\n\n\"You needn't bother,\" Craig said. He smiled with savage mirthlessness.\n\"I'll be glad to take care of any such incidents.\"\n\nPrentiss saw to it that the piles of wood for the guard fires were ready\nto be lighted when the time came. He ordered all guards to their\nstations, there to get what rest they could. They would have no rest at\nall after darkness came.\n\nHe met Lake at the north end of his own group's camp, where it merged\nwith Lake's group and no guard line was needed. Lake told him that his\ncamp would be as well prepared as possible under the circumstances\nwithin another hour. By then the wind in the trees was growing swiftly\nstronger, slapping harder and harder at the shelters, and it seemed\ndoubtful that the storm would hold off for an hour.\n\nBut Lake was given his hour, plus half of another. Then deep dusk came,\nalthough it was not quite sundown. Prentiss ordered all the guard fires\nlighted and all the women and children into the shelters. Fifteen\nminutes later the storm finally broke.\n\nIt came as a roaring downpour of cold rain. Complete darkness came with\nit and the wind rose to a velocity that made the trees lean. An hour\nwent by and the wind increased, smashing at the shelters with a violence\nthey had not been built to withstand. The prowler skin lashings held but\nthe canvas and blankets were ripped into streamers that cracked like\nrifle shots in the wind before they were torn completely loose and flung\ninto the night.\n\nOne by one the guard fires went out and the rain continued, growing\ncolder and driven in almost horizontal sheets by the wind. The women and\nchildren huddled in chilled misery in what meager protection the torn\nshelters still gave and there was nothing that could be done to help\nthem.\n\nThe rain turned to snow at midnight, a howling blizzard through which\nPrentiss's light could penetrate but a few feet as he made his rounds.\nHe walked with slogging weariness, forcing himself on. He was no longer\nyoung--he was fifty--and he had had little rest.\n\nHe had known, of course, that successful leadership would involve more\nsacrifice on his part than on the part of those he led. He could have\nshunned responsibility and his personal welfare would have benefited. He\nhad lived on alien worlds almost half his life; with a rifle and a knife\nhe could have lived, until Ragnarok finally killed him, with much less\neffort than that required of him as leader. But such an action had been\nrepugnant to him, unthinkable. What he knew of survival on hostile\nworlds might help the others to survive.\n\nSo he had assumed command, tolerating no objections and disregarding the\nfact that he would be shortening his already short time to live on\nRagnarok. It was, he supposed, some old instinct that forbade the\nindividual to stand aside and let the group die.\n\nThe snow stopped an hour later and the wind died to a frigid moaning.\nThe clouds thinned, broke apart, and the giant star looked down upon the\nland with its cold, blue light.\n\nThe prowlers came then.\n\nThey feinted against the east and west guard lines, then hit the south\nline in massed, ferocious attack. Twenty got through, past the\nslaughtered south guards, and charged into the interior of the camp. As\nthey did so the call, prearranged by him in case of such an event, went\nup the guard lines:\n\n\"Emergency guards, east and west--_close in!_\"\n\nIn the camp, above the triumphant, demoniac yammering of the prowlers,\ncame the screams of women, the thinner cries of children, and the\nshouting and cursing of men as they tried to fight the prowlers with\nknives and clubs. Then the emergency guards--every third man from the\neast and west lines--came plunging through the snow, firing as they\ncame.\n\nThe prowlers launched themselves away from their victims and toward the\nguards, leaving a woman to stagger aimlessly with blood spurting from a\nsevered artery and splashing dark in the starlight on the blue-white\nsnow. The air was filled with the cracking of gunfire and the deep,\nsavage snarling of the prowlers. Half of the prowlers broke through,\nleaving seven dead guards behind them. The others lay in the snow where\nthey had fallen and the surviving emergency guards turned to hurry back\nto their stations, reloading as they went.\n\nThe wounded woman had crumpled down in the snow and a first aid man\nknelt over her. He straightened, shaking his head, and joined the others\nas they searched for injured among the prowlers' victims.\n\nThey found no injured; only the dead. The prowlers killed with grim\nefficiency.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"John----\"\n\nJohn Chiara, the young doctor, hurried toward him. His dark eyes were\nworried behind his frosted glasses and his eyebrows were coated with\nice.\n\n\"The wood is soaked,\" he said. \"It's going to be some time before we can\nget fires going. There are babies that will freeze to death before\nthen.\"\n\nPrentiss looked at the prowlers lying in the snow and motioned toward\nthem. \"They're warm. Have their guts and lungs taken out.\"\n\n\"What----\"\n\nThen Chiara's eyes lighted with comprehension and he hurried away\nwithout further questions.\n\nPrentiss went on, to make the rounds of the guards. When he returned he\nsaw that his order had been obeyed.\n\nThe prowlers lay in the snow as before, their savage faces still twisted\nin their dying snarls, but snug and warm inside them babies slept.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe prowlers attacked again and again and when the wan sun lifted to\nshine down on the white, frozen land there were five hundred dead in\nPrentiss's camp: three hundred by Hell Fever and two hundred by prowler\nattacks.\n\nFive hundred--and that had been only one night on Ragnarok.\n\nLake reported over six hundred dead. \"I hope,\" he said with bitter\nhatred, \"that the Gerns slept comfortably last night.\"\n\n\"We'll have to build a wall around the camp to hold out the prowlers,\"\nPrentiss said. \"We don't dare keep using up what little ammunition we\nhave at the rate we've used it the last two nights.\"\n\n\"That will be a big job in this gravity,\" Lake said. \"We'll have to\ncrowd both groups in together to let its circumference be as small as\npossible.\"\n\nIt was the way Prentiss had planned to do it. One thing would have to be\nsettled with Lake: there could not be two independent leaders over the\nmerged groups.\n\nLake, watching him, said, \"I think we can get along. Alien worlds are\nyour specialty rather than mine. And according to the Ragnarok law of\naverages, there will be only one of us pretty soon, anyway.\"\n\nAll were moved to the center of the camp area that day and when the\nprowlers came that night they found a ring of guards and fires through\nwhich they could penetrate only with heavy sacrifices.\n\nThere was warmth to the sun the next morning and the snow began to melt.\nWork was commenced on the stockade wall. It would have to be twelve feet\nhigh so the prowlers could not jump over it and, since the prowlers had\nthe sharp claws and climbing ability of cats, its top would have to be\nsurmounted with a row of sharp outward-and-downward projecting stakes.\nThese would be set in sockets in the top rail and tied down with strips\nof prowler skin.\n\nThe trees east of camp were festooned for a great distance with the\nremnants of canvas and cloth the wind had left there. A party of boys,\nprotected by the usual prowler guards, was sent out to climb the trees\nand recover it. All of it, down to the smallest fragment, was turned\nover to the women who were physically incapable of helping work on the\nstockade wall. They began patiently sewing the rags and tatters back\ninto usable form again.\n\nThe first hunting party went out and returned with six of the\ntawny-yellow sharp-horned woods goats, each as large as an Earth deer.\nThe hunters reported the woods goats to be hard to stalk and dangerous\nwhen cornered. One hunter was killed and another injured because of not\nknowing that.\n\nThey also brought in a few of the rabbit-sized scavenger animals. They\nwere all legs and teeth and bristly fur, the meat almost inedible. It\nwould be a waste of the limited ammunition to shoot any more of them.\n\nThere was a black barked tree which the Dunbar Expedition had called the\nlance tree because of its slender, straightly outthrust limbs. Its wood\nwas as hard as hickory and as springy as cedar. Prentiss found two\namateur archers who were sure they could make efficient bows and arrows\nout of the lance tree limbs. He gave them the job, together with\nhelpers.\n\nThe days turned suddenly hot, with nights that still went below\nfreezing. The Hell Fever took a constant, relentless toll. They needed\nadequate shelters--but the dwindling supply of ammunition and the\nnightly prowler attacks made the need for a stockade wall even more\nimperative. The shelters would have to wait.\n\nHe went looking for Dr. Chiara one evening and found him just leaving\none of the makeshift shelters.\n\nA boy lay inside it, his face flushed with Hell Fever and his eyes too\nbright and too dark as he looked up into the face of his mother who sat\nbeside him. She was dry-eyed and silent as she looked down at him but\nshe was holding his hand in hers, tightly, desperately, as though she\nmight that way somehow keep him from leaving her.\n\nPrentiss walked beside Chiara and when the shelter was behind them he\nasked, \"There's no hope?\"\n\n\"None,\" Chiara said. \"There never is with Hell Fever.\"\n\nChiara had changed. He was no longer the stocky, cheerful man he had\nbeen on the _Constellation_, whose brown eyes had smiled at the world\nthrough thick glasses and who had laughed and joked as he assured his\npatients that all would soon be well with them. He was thin and his face\nwas haggard with worry. He had, in his quiet way, been fully as valiant\nas any of those who had fought the prowlers. He had worked day and night\nto fight a form of death he could not see and against which he had no\nweapon.\n\n\"The boy is dying,\" Chiara said. \"He knows it and his mother knows it. I\ntold them the medicine I gave him might help. It was a lie, to try to\nmake it a little easier for both of them before the end comes. The\nmedicine I gave him was a salt tablet--that's all I have.\"\n\nAnd then, with the first bitterness Prentiss had ever seen him display,\nChiara said, \"You call me 'Doctor.' Everyone does. I'm not--I'm only a\nfirst-year intern. I do the best I know how to do but it isn't\nenough--it will never be enough.\"\n\n\"What you have to learn here is something no Earth doctor knows or could\nteach you,\" he said. \"You have to have time to learn--and you need\nequipment and drugs.\"\n\n\"If I could have antibiotics and other drugs ... I wanted to get a\nsupply from the dispensary but the Gerns wouldn't let me go.\"\n\n\"Some of the Ragnarok plants might be of value if a person could find\nthe right ones. I just came from a talk with Anders about that. He'll\nprovide you with anything possible in the way of equipment and supplies\nfor research--anything in the camp you need to try to save lives. He'll\nbe at your shelter tonight to see what you want. Do you want to try it?\"\n\n\"Yes--of course.\" Chiara's eyes lighted with new hope. \"It might take a\nlong time to find a cure--maybe we never would--but I'd like to have\nhelp so I could try. I'd like to be able, some day once again, to say to\na scared kid, 'Take this medicine and in the morning you'll be better,'\nand know I told the truth.\"\n\nThe nightly prowler attacks continued and the supply of ammunition\ndiminished. It would be some time before men were skilled in the use of\nthe bows and arrows that were being made; and work on the wall was\npushed ahead with all speed possible. No one was exempt from labor on it\nwho could as much as carry the pointed stakes. Children down to the\nyoungest worked alongside the men and women.\n\nThe work was made many times more exhausting by the 1.5 gravity. People\nmoved heavily at their jobs and even at night there was no surcease from\nthe gravity. They could only go into a coma-like sleep in which there\nwas no real rest and from which they awoke tired and aching. Each\nmorning there would be some who did not awaken at all, though their\nhearts had been sound enough for working on Earth or Athena.\n\nThe killing labor was recognized as necessary, however, and there were\nno complaints until the morning he was accosted by Peter Bemmon.\n\nHe had seen Bemmon several times on the _Constellation_; a big,\nsoft-faced man who had attached much importance to his role as a minor\nmember of the Athena Planning Board. But even on the _Constellation_\nBemmon had felt he merited a still higher position, and his\ningratiating attitude when before his superiors had become one of\nfault-finding insinuations concerning their ability as compared with his\nwhen their backs were turned.\n\nThis resentment had taken new form on Ragnarok, where his former\nposition was of utterly no importance to anyone and his lack of any\nskills or outdoor experience made him only one worker among others.\n\nThe sun was shining mercilessly hot the day Bemmon chose to challenge\nPrentiss's wisdom as leader. Bemmon was cutting and sharpening stakes, a\njob the sometimes-too-lenient Anders had given him when Bemmon had\ninsisted his heart was on the verge of failure from doing heavier work.\nPrentiss was in a hurry and would have gone on past him but Bemmon\nhalted him with a sharp command:\n\n\"You--wait a minute!\"\n\nBemmon had a hatchet in his hand, but only one stake lay on the ground;\nand his face was red with anger, not exertion. Prentiss stopped,\nwondering if Bemmon was going to ask for a broken jaw, and Bemmon came\nto him.\n\n\"How long,\" Bemmon asked, anger making his voice a little thick, \"do you\nthink I'll tolerate this absurd situation?\"\n\n\"What situation?\" Prentiss asked.\n\n\"This stupid insistence upon confining me to manual labor. I'm the\nsingle member on Ragnarok of the Athena Planning Board and surely you\ncan see that this bumbling confusion of these people\"--Bemmon indicated\nthe hurrying, laboring men, women and children around them--\"can be\ntransformed into efficient, organized effort only through proper\nsupervision. Yet my abilities along such lines are ignored and I've been\nforced to work as a common laborer--a wood chopper!\"\n\nHe flung the hatchet down viciously, into the rocks at his feet,\nbreathing heavily with resentment and challenge. \"I demand the respect\nto which I'm entitled.\"\n\n\"Look,\" Prentiss said.\n\nHe pointed to the group just then going past them. A sixteen-year-old\ngirl was bent almost double under the weight of the pole she was\ncarrying, her once pretty face flushed and sweating. Behind her two\ntwelve-year-old boys were dragging a still larger pole. Behind them\ncame several small children, each of them carrying as many of the\npointed stakes as he or she could walk under, no matter if it was only\none. All of them were trying to hurry, to accomplish as much as\npossible, and no one was complaining even though they were already\nstaggering with weariness.\n\n\"So you think you're entitled to more respect?\" Prentiss asked. \"Those\nkids would work harder if you were giving them orders from under the\nshade of a tree--is that what you want?\"\n\nBemmon's lips thinned and hatred was like a sheen on his face. Prentiss\nlooked from the single stake Bemmon had cut that morning to Bemmon's\nwhite, unblistered hands. He looked at the hatchet that Bemmon had\nthrown down in the rocks and at the V notch broken in its keen-edged\nblade. It had been the best of the very few hatchets they had....\n\n\"The next time you even nick that hatchet I'm going to split your skull\nwith it,\" he said. \"Pick it up and get back to work. I mean _work_.\nYou'll have broken blisters on every finger tonight or you'll go on the\nlog-carrying force tomorrow. Now, move!\"\n\nWhat Bemmon had thought to be his wrath deserted him before Prentiss's\nfury. He stooped to obey the order but the hatred remained on his face\nand when the hatchet was in his hands he made a last attempt to bluster:\n\n\"The day may come when we'll refuse to tolerate any longer your sadistic\ndisplays of authority.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Prentiss said. \"Anyone who doesn't like my style is welcome to\ntry to change it--or to try to replace me. With knives or clubs, rifles\nor broken hatchets, Bemmon--any way you want it and any time you want\nit.\"\n\n\"I----\" Bemmon's eyes went from the hatchet in his half raised hand to\nthe long knife in Prentiss's belt. He swallowed with a convulsive jerk\nof his Adam's apple and his hatchet-bearing arm suddenly wilted. \"I\ndon't want to fight--to replace you----\"\n\nHe swallowed again and his face forced itself into a sickly attempt at\nan ingratiating smile. \"I didn't mean to imply any disrespect for you\nor the good job you're doing. I'm very sorry.\"\n\nThen he hurried away, like a man glad to escape, and began to chop\nstakes with amazing speed.\n\nBut the sullen hatred had not been concealed by the ingratiating smile;\nand Prentiss knew Bemmon was a man who would always be his enemy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe days dragged by in the weary routine, but overworked muscles slowly\nstrengthened and people moved with a little less laborious effort. On\nthe twentieth day the wall was finally completed and the camp was\nprowler proof.\n\nBut the spring weather was a mad succession of heat and cold and storm\nthat caused the Hell Fever to take its toll each day and there was no\nrelaxation from the grueling labor. Weatherproof shelters had to be\nbuilt as rapidly as possible.\n\nSo the work of constructing them began; wearily, sometimes almost\nhopelessly, but without complaint other than to hate and curse the Gerns\nmore than ever.\n\nThere was no more trouble from Bemmon; Prentiss had almost forgotten him\nwhen he was publicly challenged one night by a burly, threatening man\nnamed Haggar.\n\n\"You've bragged that you'll fight any man who dares disagree with you,\"\nHaggar said loudly. \"Well, here I am. We'll use knives and before they\neven have time to bury you tonight I'm goin' to have your stooges kicked\nout and replaced with men who'll give us competent leadership instead of\nblunderin' authoritarianism.\"\n\nPrentiss noticed that Haggar seemed to have a little difficulty\npronouncing the last word, as though he had learned it only recently.\n\n\"I'll be glad to accommodate you,\" Prentiss said mildly. \"Go get\nyourself a knife.\"\n\nHaggar already had one, a long-bladed butcher knife, and the duel began.\nHaggar was surprisingly adept with his knife but he had never had the\ntraining and experience in combat that interstellar explorers such as\nPrentiss had. Haggar was good, but considerably far from good enough.\n\nPrentiss did not kill him. He had no compunctions about doing such a\nthing, but it would have been an unnecessary waste of needed manpower.\nHe gave Haggar a carefully painful and bloody lesson that thoroughly\nbanished all his lust for conflict without seriously injuring him. The\nduel was over within a minute after it began.\n\nBemmon, who had witnessed the challenge with keen interest and then\nwatched Haggar's defeat with agitation, became excessively friendly and\nflattering toward Prentiss afterward. Prentiss felt sure, although he\nhad no proof, that it had been Bemmon who had spurred the simple-minded\nHaggar into challenging him to a duel.\n\nIf so, the sight of what had happened to Haggar must have effectively\ndampened Bemmon's desire for revenge because he became almost a model\nworker.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Lake had predicted, he and Prentiss worked together well. Lake calmly\ntook a secondary role, not at all interested in possession of authority\nbut only in the survival of the Rejects. He spoke of the surrender of\nthe _Constellation_ only once, to say:\n\n\"I knew there could be only Ragnarok in this section of space. I had to\norder four thousand people to go like sheep to what was to be their\nplace of execution so that four thousand more could live as slaves. That\nwas my last act as an officer.\"\n\nPrentiss suspected that Lake found it impossible not to blame himself\nsubconsciously for what circumstances had forced him to do. It was\nirrational--but conscientious men were quite often a little irrational\nin their sense of responsibility.\n\nLake had two subleaders: a genial, red-haired man named Ben Barber, who\nwould have been a farmer on Athena but who made a good subleader on\nRagnarok; and a lithe, cat-like man named Karl Schroeder.\n\nSchroeder claimed to be twenty-four but not even the scars on his face\ncould make him look more than twenty-one. He smiled often, a little too\noften. Prentiss had seen smiles like that before. Schroeder was the type\nwho could smile while he killed a man--and he probably had.\n\nBut, if Schroeder was a born fighter and perhaps killer, they were\ncharacteristics that he expended entirely upon the prowlers. He was\nLake's right hand man; a deadly marksman and utterly without fear.\n\nOne evening, when Lake had given Schroeder some instructions concerning\nthe next day's activities, Schroeder answered him with the half-mocking\nsmile and the words, \"I'll see that it's done, Commander.\"\n\n\"Not 'Commander,'\" Lake said. \"I--all of us--left our ranks, titles and\nhonors on the _Constellation_. The past is dead for us.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Schroeder said. The smile faded away and he looked into Lake's\neyes as he asked, \"And what about our past dishonors, disgraces and\nsuch?\"\n\n\"They were left on the _Constellation_, too,\" Lake said. \"If anyone\nwants dishonor he'll have to earn it all over again.\"\n\n\"That sounds fair,\" Schroeder said. \"That sounds as fair as anyone could\never ask for.\"\n\nHe turned away and Prentiss saw what he had noticed before: Schroeder's\nblack hair was coming out light brown at the roots. It was a color that\nwould better match his light complexion and it was the color of hair\nthat a man named Schrader, wanted by the police on Venus, had had.\n\nHair could be dyed, identification cards could be forged--but it was all\nsomething Prentiss did not care to pry into until and if Schroeder gave\nhim reason to. Schroeder was a hard and dangerous man, despite his\nyouth, and sometimes men of that type, when the chips were down,\nexhibited a higher sense of duty than the soft men who spoke piously of\nrespect for Society--and then were afraid to face danger to protect the\nsociety and the people they claimed to respect.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA lone prowler came on the eleventh night following the wall's\ncompletion. It came silently, in the dead of night, and it learned how\nto reach in and tear apart the leather lashings that held the pointed\nstakes in place and then jerk the stakes out of their sockets. It was\nseen as it was removing the third stake--which would have made a large\nenough opening for it to come through--and shot. It fell back and\nmanaged to escape into the woods, although staggering and bleeding.\n\nThe next night the stockade was attacked by dozens of prowlers who\nsimultaneously began removing the pointed stakes in the same manner\nemployed by the prowler of the night before. Their attack was turned\nback with heavy losses on both sides and with a dismayingly large\nexpenditure of precious ammunition.\n\nThere could be no doubt about how the band of prowlers had learned to\nremove the stakes: the prowler of the night before had told them before\nit died. It was doubtful that the prowlers had a spoken language, but\nthey had some means of communication. They worked together and they were\nhighly intelligent, probably about halfway between dog and man.\n\nThe prowlers were going to be an enemy even more formidable than\nPrentiss had thought.\n\nThe missing stakes were replaced the next day and the others were tied\ndown more securely. Once again the camp was prowler proof--but only for\nso long as armed guards patrolled inside the walls to kill attacking\nprowlers during the short time it would take them to remove the stakes.\n\nThe hunting parties suffered unusually heavy losses from prowler attacks\nthat day and that evening, as the guards patrolled inside the walls,\nLake said to Prentiss:\n\n\"The prowlers are so damnably persistent. It isn't that they're\nhungry--they don't kill us to eat us. They don't have any reason to kill\nus--they just hate us.\"\n\n\"They have a reason,\" Prentiss said. \"They're doing the same thing we're\ndoing: fighting for survival.\"\n\nLake's pale brows lifted in question.\n\n\"The prowlers are the rulers of Ragnarok,\" Prentiss said. \"They fought\ntheir way up here, as men did on Earth, until they're master of every\ncreature on their world. Even of the unicorns and swamp crawlers. But\nnow we've come and they're intelligent enough to know that we're\naccustomed to being the dominant species, ourselves.\n\n\"There can't be two dominant species on the same world--and they know\nit. Men or prowlers--in the end one is going to have to go down before\nthe other.\"\n\n\"I suppose you're right,\" Lake said. He looked at the guards, a fourth\nof them already reduced to bows and arrows that they had not yet had\ntime to learn how to use. \"If we win the battle for supremacy it will be\na long fight, maybe over a period of centuries. And if the prowlers\nwin--it may all be over within a year or two.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe giant blue star that was the other component of Ragnarok's binary\ngrew swiftly in size as it preceded the yellow sun farther each morning.\nWhen summer came the blue star would be a sun as hot as the yellow sun\nand Ragnarok would be between them. The yellow sun would burn the land\nby day and the blue sun would sear it by the night that would not be\nnight. Then would come the brief fall, followed by the long, frozen\nwinter when the yellow sun would shine pale and cold, far to the south,\nand the blue sun would be a star again, two hundred and fifty million\nmiles away and invisible behind the cold yellow sun.\n\nThe Hell Fever lessened with the completion of the shelters but it still\nkilled each day. Chiara and his helpers worked with unfaltering\ndetermination to find a cure for it but the cure, if there was one,\neluded them. The graves in the cemetery were forty long by forty wide\nand more were added each day. To all the fact became grimly obvious:\nthey were swiftly dying out and they had yet to face Ragnarok at its\nworst.\n\nThe old survival instincts asserted themselves and there were marriages\namong the younger ones. One of the first to marry was Julia.\n\nShe stopped to talk to Prentiss one evening. She still wore the red\nskirt, now faded and patched, but her face was tired and thoughtful and\nno longer bold.\n\n\"Is it true, John,\" she asked, \"that only a few of us might be able to\nhave children here and that most of us who tried to have children in\nthis gravity would die for it?\"\n\n\"It's true,\" he said. \"But you already knew that when you married.\"\n\n\"Yes ... I knew it.\" There was a little silence. \"All my life I've had\nfun and done as I pleased. The human race didn't need me and we both\nknew it. But now--none of us can be apart from the others or be afraid\nof anything. If we're selfish and afraid there will come a time when the\nlast of us will die and there will be nothing on Ragnarok to show we\nwere ever here.\n\n\"I don't want it to end like that. I want there to be children, to live\nafter we're gone. So I'm going to try to have a child. I'm not afraid\nand I won't be.\"\n\nWhen he did not reply at once she said, almost self-consciously, \"Coming\nfrom me that all sounds a little silly, I suppose.\"\n\n\"It sounds wise and splendid, Julia,\" he said, \"and it's what I thought\nyou were going to say.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFull spring came and the vegetation burst into leaf and bud and bloom,\nquickly, for its growth instincts knew in their mindless way how short\nwas the time to grow and reproduce before the brown death of summer\ncame. The prowlers were suddenly gone one day, to follow the spring\nnorth, and for a week men could walk and work outside the stockade\nwithout the protection of armed guards.\n\nThen the new peril appeared, the one they had not expected: the\nunicorns.\n\nThe stockade wall was a blue-black rectangle behind them and the blue\nstar burned with the brilliance of a dozen moons, lighting the woods in\nblue shadow and azure light. Prentiss and the hunter walked a little in\nfront of the two riflemen, winding to keep in the starlit glades.\n\n\"It was on the other side of the next grove of trees,\" the hunter said\nin a low voice. \"Fred was getting ready to bring in the rest of the\nwoods goat. He shouldn't have been more than ten minutes behind me--and\nit's been over an hour.\"\n\nThey rounded the grove of trees. At first it seemed there was nothing\nbefore them but the empty, grassy glade. Then they saw it lying on the\nground no more than twenty feet in front of them.\n\nIt was--it had been--a man. He was broken and stamped into hideous\nshapelessness and something had torn off his arms.\n\nFor a moment there was dead silence, then the hunter whispered, _\"What\ndid that?\"_\n\nThe answer came in a savage, squealing scream and the pound of cloven\nhooves. A formless shadow beside the trees materialized into a monstrous\ncharging bulk; a thing like a gigantic gray bull, eight feet tall at the\nshoulders, with the tusked, snarling head of a boar and the starlight\nglinting along the curving, vicious length of its single horn.\n\n_\"Unicorn!\"_ Prentiss said, and jerked up his rifle.\n\nThe rifles cracked in a ragged volley. The unicorn squealed in fury and\nstruck the hunter, catching him on its horn and hurling him thirty feet.\nOne of the riflemen went down under the unicorn's hooves, his cry ending\nalmost as soon as it began.\n\nThe unicorn ripped the sod in deep furrows as it whirled back to\nPrentiss and the remaining rifleman; not turning in the manner of\nfour-footed beasts of Earth but rearing and spinning on its hind feet.\nIt towered above them as it whirled, the tip of its horn fifteen feet\nabove the ground and its hooves swinging around like great clubs.\n\nPrentiss shot again, his sights on what he hoped would be a vital area,\nand the rifleman shot an instant later.\n\nThe shots went true. The unicorn's swing brought it on around but it\ncollapsed, falling to the ground with jarring heaviness.\n\n\"We got it!\" the rifleman said. \"We----\"\n\nIt half scrambled to its feet and made a noise; a call that went out\nthrough the night like the blast of a mighty trumpet. Then it dropped\nback to the ground, to die while its call was still echoing from the\nnearer hills.\n\nFrom the east came an answering trumpet blast; a trumpeting that was\nsounded again from the south and from the north. Then there came a low\nand muffled drumming, like the pounding of thousands of hooves.\n\nThe rifleman's face was blue-white in the starlight. \"The others are\ncoming--we'll have to run for it!\"\n\nHe turned, and began to run toward the distant bulk of the stockade.\n\n\"No!\" Prentiss commanded, quick and harsh. \"Not the stockade!\"\n\nThe rifleman kept running, seeming not to hear him in his panic.\nPrentiss called to him once more:\n\n\"Not the stockade--_you'll lead the unicorns into it!_\"\n\nAgain the rifleman seemed not to hear him.\n\nThe unicorns were coming in sight, converging in from the north and east\nand south, the rumble of their hooves swelling to a thunder that filled\nthe night. The rifleman would reach the stockade only a little ahead of\nthem and they would go through the wall as though it had been made of\npaper.\n\nFor a little while the area inside the stockade would be filled with\ndust, with the squealing of the swirling, charging unicorns and the\nscreams of the dying. Those inside the stockade would have no chance\nwhatever of escaping. Within two minutes it would be over, the last\nchild would have been found among the shattered shelters and trampled\ninto lifeless shapelessness in the bloody ground.\n\nWithin two minutes all human life on Ragnarok would be gone.\n\nThere was only one thing for him to do.\n\nHe dropped to one knee so his aim would be steady and the sights of his\nrifle caught the running man's back. He pressed the trigger and the\nrifle cracked viciously as it bucked against his shoulder.\n\nThe man spun and fell hard to the ground. He twisted, to raise himself\nup a little and look back, his face white and accusing and unbelieving.\n\n_\"You shot me!\"_\n\nThen he fell forward and lay without moving.\n\nPrentiss turned back to face the unicorns and to look at the trees in\nthe nearby grove. He saw what he already knew, they were young trees and\ntoo small to offer any escape for him. There was no place to run, no\nplace to hide.\n\nThere was nothing he could do but wait; nothing he could do but stand in\nthe blue starlight and watch the devil's herd pound toward him and\nthink, in the last moments of his life, how swiftly and unexpectedly\ndeath could come to man on Ragnarok.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe unicorns held the Rejects prisoners in their stockade the rest of\nthe night and all the next day. Lake had seen the shooting of the\nrifleman and had watched the unicorn herd kill John Prentiss and then\ntrample the dead rifleman.\n\nHe had already given the order to build a quick series of fires around\nthe inside of the stockade walls when the unicorns paused to tear their\nvictims to pieces; grunting and squealing in triumph as bones crushed\nbetween their teeth and they flung the pieces to one side.\n\nThe fires were started and green wood was thrown on them, to make them\nsmoulder and smoke for as long as possible. Then the unicorns were\ncoming on to the stockade and every person inside it went into the\nconcealment of the shelters.\n\nLake had already given his last order: There would be absolute quiet\nuntil and if the unicorns left; a quiet that would be enforced with fist\nor club wherever necessary.\n\nThe unicorns were still outside when morning came. The fires could not\nbe refueled; the sight of a man moving inside the stockade would bring\nthe entire herd charging through. The hours dragged by, the smoke from\nthe dying fires dwindled to thin streamers. The unicorns grew\nincreasingly bolder and suspicious, crowding closer to the walls and\npeering through the openings between the rails.\n\nThe sun was setting when one of the unicorns trumpeted; a sound\ndifferent from that of the call to battle. The others threw up their\nheads to listen, then they turned and drifted away. Within minutes the\nentire herd was gone out of sight through the woods, toward the north.\n\nLake waited and watched until he was sure the unicorns were gone for\ngood. Then he ordered the All Clear given and hurried to the south wall,\nto look down across the barren valley and hope he would not see what he\nexpected to see.\n\nBarber came up behind him, to sigh with relief. \"That was close. It's\nhard to make so many people stay absolutely quiet for hour after hour.\nEspecially the children--they don't understand.\"\n\n\"We'll have to leave,\" Lake said.\n\n\"Leave?\" Barber asked. \"We can make this stockade strong enough to hold\nout unicorns.\"\n\n\"Look to the south,\" Lake told him.\n\nBarber did so and saw what Lake had already seen; a broad, low cloud of\ndust moving slowly toward them.\n\n\"Another herd of unicorns,\" Lake said. \"John didn't know they\nmigrated--the Dunbar Expedition wasn't here long enough to learn that.\nThere'll be herd after herd coming through and no time for us to\nstrengthen the walls. We'll have to leave tonight.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPreparations were made for the departure; preparations that consisted\nmainly of providing each person with as much in the way of food or\nsupplies as he or she could carry. In the 1.5 gravity, that was not\nmuch.\n\nThey left when the blue star rose. They filed out through the northern\ngate and the rear guard closed it behind them. There was almost no\nconversation among them. Some of them turned to take a last look at what\nhad been the only home they had ever known on Ragnarok, then they all\nfaced forward again, to the northwest, where the foothills of the\nplateau might offer them sanctuary.\n\nThey found their sanctuary on the second day; a limestone ridge\nhoney-combed with caves. Men were sent back at once to carry the food\nand supplies left in the stockade to the new home.\n\nThey returned, to report that the second herd of unicorns had broken\ndown the walls and ripped the interior of the stockade into wreckage.\nMuch of the food and supplies had been totally destroyed.\n\nLake sent them back twice more to bring everything, down to the last\npiece of bent metal or torn cloth. They would find uses for all of it in\nthe future.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cave system was extensive, containing room for several times their\nnumber. The deeper portions of the caves could not be lived in until\nventilation ducts were made, but the outer caves were more than\nsufficient in number. Work was begun to clear them of fallen rubble, to\npry down all loose material overhead and to level the floors. A spring\ncame out of the ridge not far from the caves and the approach to the\ncaves was so narrow and steep that unicorns could scramble up it only\nwith difficulty and one at a time. And should they ever reach the\nnatural terrace in front of the caves they would be too large to enter\nand could do no more than stand outside and make targets of themselves\nfor the bowmen within.\n\nAnders was in charge of making the caves livable, his working force\nrestricted almost entirely to women and children. Lake sent Barber out,\nwith a small detachment of men, to observe the woods goats and learn\nwhat plants they ate. And then learn, by experimenting, if such plants\ncould be safely eaten by humans.\n\nThe need for salt would be tremendously increased when summer came.\nHaving once experienced a saltless two weeks in the desert Lake doubted\nthat any of them could survive without it. All hunting parties, as well\nas Barber's party, were ordered to investigate all deposits that might\ncontain salt as well as any stream or pond that was white along the\nbanks.\n\nThe hunting parties were of paramount importance and they were kept out\nto the limits of their endurance. Every man physically able to do so\naccompanied them. Those who could not kill game could carry it back to\nthe caves. There was no time to spare; already the unicorns were\ndecreasing in numbers and the woods goats were ranging farther and\nfarther north.\n\nAt the end of twenty days Lake went in search of Barber and his party,\nworried about them. Their mission was one that could be as dangerous as\nany hunting trip. There was no proof that humans and Ragnarok creatures\nwere so similar as to guarantee that food for one might not be poison\nfor the other. It was a very necessary mission, however; dried meat,\nalone, would bring grave deficiency diseases during the summer which\ndried herbs and fruits would help prevent.\n\nWhen he located Barber's party he found Barber lying under a tree, pale\nand weak from his latest experiment but recovering.\n\n\"I was the guinea pig yesterday,\" Barber said. \"Some little purple\nberries that the woods goats nibble at sometimes, maybe to get a touch\nof some certain vitamin or something. I ate too many, I guess, because\nthey hit my heart like the kick of a mule.\"\n\n\"Did you find anything at all encouraging?\" Lake asked.\n\n\"We found four different herbs that are the most violent cathartics you\never dreamed of. And a little silvery fern that tastes like vanilla\nflavored candy and paralyzes you stiff as a board on the third swallow.\nIt's an hour before you come back out of it.\n\n\"But on the good side we found three different kinds of herbs that seem\nto be all right. We've been digging them up and hanging them in the\ntrees to dry.\"\n\nLake tried the edible herbs and found them to be something like spinach\nin taste. There was a chance they might contain the vitamins and\nminerals needed. Since the hunting parties were living exclusively on\nmeat he would have to point out the edible herbs to all of them so they\nwould know what to eat should any of them feel the effects of diet\ndeficiency.\n\nHe traveled alone as he visited the various hunting parties, finding\nsuch travel to be safer each day as the dwindling of the unicorns neared\nthe vanishing point. It was a safety he did not welcome; it meant the\nlast of the game would be gone north long before sufficient meat was\ntaken.\n\nNone of the hunting parties could report good luck. The woods goats,\nswift and elusive at best, were vanishing with the unicorns. The last\ncartridge had been fired and the bowmen, while improving all the time,\nwere far from expert. The unicorns, which should have been their major\nsource of meat, were invulnerable to arrows unless shot at short range\nin the side of the neck just behind the head. And at short range the\nunicorns invariably charged and presented no such target.\n\nHe made the long, hard climb up the plateau's southern face, to stand at\nlast on top. It was treeless, a flat, green table that stretched to the\nnorth for as far as he could see. A mountain range, still capped with\nsnow, lay perhaps a hundred miles to the northwest; in the distance it\nlooked like a white, low-lying cloud on the horizon. No other mountains\nor hills marred the endless sweep of the high plain.\n\nThe grass was thick and here and there were little streams of water\nproduced by the recently melted snow. It was a paradise land for the\nherbivores of Ragnarok but for men it was a harsh, forbidding place. At\nthat elevation the air was so thin that only a moderate amount of\nexertion made the heart and lungs labor painfully. Hard and prolonged\nexertion would be impossible.\n\nIt seemed unlikely that men could hunt and dare unicorn attacks at such\nan elevation but two hunting parties were ahead of him; one under the\ngrim Craig and one under the reckless Schroeder, both parties stripped\ndown to the youngest, strongest men among all the Rejects.\n\nHe found Schroeder early one morning, leading his hunters toward a small\nband of woods goats. Two unicorns were grazing in between and the\nhunters were swinging downwind from them. Schroeder saw him coming and\nwalked back a little way to meet him.\n\n\"Welcome to our breathtaking land,\" Schroeder greeted him. \"How are\nthings going with the rest of the hunting parties?\"\n\nSchroeder was gaunt and there was weariness beneath his still lithe\nmovements. His whiskers were an untamed sorrel bristling and across his\ncheekbone was the ugly scar of a half healed wound. Another gash was\nripped in his arm and something had battered one ear. He reminded Lake\nof a battle-scarred, indomitable tomcat who would never, for as long as\nhe lived, want to relinquish the joy of conflict and danger.\n\n\"So far,\" he answered, \"you and Craig are the only parties to manage to\ntackle the plateau.\"\n\nHe asked about Schroeder's luck and learned it had been much better than\nthat of the others due to killing three unicorns by a method Schroeder\nhad thought of.\n\n\"Since the bowmen have to be to one side of the unicorns to kill them,\"\nSchroeder said, \"it only calls for a man to be the decoy and let the\nunicorns chase him between the hidden bowmen. If there's no more than\none or two unicorns and if the decoy doesn't have to run very far and if\nthe bowmen don't miss it works well.\"\n\n\"Judging from your beat-up condition,\" Lake said, \"you must have been\nthe decoy every time.\"\n\n\"Well----\" Schroeder shrugged his shoulders. \"It was my idea.\"\n\n\"I've been wondering about another way to get in shots at close range,\"\nLake said. \"Take the skin of a woods goat, give it the original shape as\nnear as possible, and a bowman inside it might be able to fake a grazing\nwoods goat until he got the shot he wanted.\n\n\"The unicorns might never suspect where the arrows came from,\" he\nconcluded. \"And then, of course, they might.\"\n\n\"I'll try it before the day is over, on those two unicorns over there,\"\nSchroeder said. \"At this elevation and in this gravity my own method is\njust a little bit rough on a man.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLake found Craig and his men several miles to the west, all of them\ngaunt and bearded as Schroeder had been.\n\n\"We've had hell,\" Craig said. \"It seems that every time we spot a few\nwoods goats there will be a dozen unicorns in between. If only we had\nrifles for the unicorns....\"\n\nLake told him of the plan to hide under woods goats' skins and of the\ndecoy system used by Schroeder.\n\n\"Maybe we won't have to use Schroeder's method,\" he said. \"We'll see if\nthe other works--I'll give it the first try.\"\n\nThis he was not to do. Less than an hour later one of the men who helped\ndry the meat and carry it to the caves returned to report the camp\nstricken by a strange, sudden malady that was killing a hundred a day.\nDr. Chiara, who had collapsed while driving himself on to care for the\nsick, was sure it was a deficiency disease. Anders was down with it,\nhelpless, and Bemmon had assumed command; setting up daily work quotas\nfor those still on their feet and refusing to heed Chiara's requests\nconcerning treatment of the disease.\n\nLake made the trip back to the caves in a fraction of the length of time\nit had taken him to reach the plateau, walking until he was ready to\ndrop and then pausing only for an hour or two of rest. He spotted\nBarber's camp when coming down off the plateau and he swung to one side,\nto tell Barber to have a supply of the herbs sent to the caves at once.\n\nHe reached the caves, to find half the camp in bed and the other half\ndragging about listlessly at the tasks given them by Bemmon. Anders was\nin grave condition, too weak to rise, and Dr. Chiara was dying.\n\nHe squatted down beside Chiara's pallet and knew there could be no hope\nfor him. On Chiara's pale face and in his eyes was the shadow of his own\nforeknowledge.\n\n\"I finally saw what it was\"--Chiara's words were very low, hard to\nhear--\"and I told Bemmon what to do. It's a deficiency disease,\ncomplicated by the gravity into some form not known on Earth.\"\n\nHe stopped to rest and Lake waited.\n\n\"Beri-beri--pellagra--we had deficiency diseases on Earth. But none so\nfatal--so quickly. I told Bemmon--ration out fruits and vegetables to\neverybody. Hurry--or it will be too late.\"\n\nAgain he stopped to rest, the last vestige of color gone from his face.\n\n\"And you?\" Lake asked, already knowing the answer.\n\n\"For me--too late. I kept thinking of viruses--should have seen the\nobvious sooner. Just like----\"\n\nHis lips turned up a little at the corners and the Chiara of the dead\npast smiled for the last time at Lake.\n\n\"Just like a damned fool intern....\"\n\nThat was all, then, and the chamber was suddenly very quiet. Lake stood\nup to leave, and to speak the words that Chiara could never hear:\n\n\"We're going to need you and miss you--Doctor.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe found Bemmon in the food storage cavern, supervising the work of two\nteen-age boys with critical officiousness although he was making no move\nto help them. At sight of Lake he hurried forward, the ingratiating\nsmile sliding across his face.\n\n\"I'm glad you're back,\" he said. \"I had to take charge when Anders got\nsick and he had everything in such a mess. I've been working day and\nnight to undo his mistakes and get the work properly under way again.\"\n\nLake looked at the two thin-faced boys who had taken advantage of the\nopportunity to rest. They leaned wearily against the heavy pole table\nBemmon had had them moving, their eyes already dull with the incipient\nsickness and watching him in mute appeal.\n\n\"Have you obeyed Chiara's order?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ah--no,\" Bemmon said. \"I felt it best to ignore it.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Lake asked.\n\n\"It would be a senseless waste of our small supply of fruit and\nvegetable foods to give them to people already dying. I'm afraid\"--the\ningratiating smile came again--\"we've been letting him exercise an\nauthority he isn't entitled to. He's really hardly more than a medical\nstudent and his diagnoses are only guesses.\"\n\n\"He's dead,\" Lake said flatly. \"His last order will be carried out.\"\n\nHe looked from the two tired boys to Bemmon, contrasting their thinness\nand weariness with the way Bemmon's paunch still bulged outward and his\njowls still sagged with their load of fat.\n\n\"I'll send West down to take over in here,\" he said to Bemmon. \"You come\nwith me. You and I seem to be the only two in good health here and\nthere's plenty of work for us to do.\"\n\nThe fawning expression vanished from Bemmon's face. \"I see,\" he said.\n\"Now that I've turned Anders's muddle into organization, you'll hand my\nauthority over to another of your favorites and demote me back to common\nlabor?\"\n\n\"Setting up work quotas for sick and dying people isn't organization,\"\nLake said. He spoke to the two boys, \"Both of you go lie down. West will\nfind someone else.\" Then to Bemmon, \"Come with me. We're both going to\nwork at common labor.\"\n\nThey passed by the cave where Bemmon slept. Two boys were just going\ninto it, carrying armloads of dried grass to make a mattress under\nBemmon's pallet. They moved slowly, heavily. Like the two boys in the\nfood storage cave they were dull-eyed with the beginning of the\nsickness.\n\nLake stopped, to look more closely into the cave and verify something\nelse he thought he had seen: Bemmon had discarded the prowler skins on\nhis bed and in their place were soft wool blankets; perhaps the only\nunpatched blankets the Rejects possessed.\n\n\"Go back to your caves,\" he said to the boys. \"Go to bed and rest.\"\n\nHe looked at Bemmon. Bemmon's eyes flickered away, refusing to meet his.\n\n\"What few blankets we have are for babies and the very youngest\nchildren,\" he said. His tone was coldly unemotional but he could not\nkeep his fists from clenching at his sides. \"You will return them at\nonce and sleep on animal skins, as all the men and women do. And if you\nwant grass for a mattress you will carry it yourself, as even the young\nchildren do.\"\n\nBemmon made no answer, his face a sullen red and hatred shining in the\neyes that still refused to meet Lake's.\n\n\"Gather up the blankets and return them,\" Lake said. \"Then come on up to\nthe central cave. We have a lot of work to do.\"\n\nHe could feel Bemmon's gaze burning against his back as he turned away\nand he thought of what John Prentiss had once said:\n\n\"I know he's no good but he never has guts enough to go quite far enough\nto give me an excuse to whittle him down.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBarber's men arrived the next day, burdened with dried herbs. These were\ngiven to the seriously ill as a supplement to the ration of fruit and\nvegetable foods and were given, alone, to those not yet sick. Then came\nthe period of waiting; of hoping that it was all not too late and too\nlittle.\n\nA noticeable change for the better began on the second day. A week went\nby and the sick were slowly, steadily, improving. The not-quite-sick\nwere already back to normal health. There was no longer any doubt: the\nRagnarok herbs would prevent a recurrence of the disease.\n\nIt was, Lake thought, all so simple once you knew what to do. Hundreds\nhad died, Chiara among them, because they did not have a common herb\nthat grew at a slightly higher elevation. Not a single life would have\nbeen lost if he could have looked a week into the future and had the\nherbs found and taken to the caves that much sooner.\n\nBut the disease had given no warning of its coming. Nothing, on\nRagnarok, ever seemed to give warning before it killed.\n\nAnother week went by and hunters began to trickle in, gaunt and\nexhausted, to report all the game going north up the plateau and not a\nsingle creature left below. They were the ones who had tried and failed\nto withstand the high elevation of the plateau. Only two out of three\nhunters returned among those who had challenged the plateau. They had\ntried, all of them, to the best of their ability and the limits of their\nendurance.\n\nThe blue star was by then a small sun and the yellow sun blazed hotter\neach day. Grass began to brown and wither on the hillsides as the days\nwent by and Lake knew summer was very near. The last hunting party, but\nfor Craig's and Schroeder's, returned. They had very little meat but\nthey brought with them a large quantity of something almost as\nimportant: salt.\n\nThey had found a deposit of it in an almost inaccessible region of\ncliffs and canyons. \"Not even the woods goats can get in there,\"\nStevens, the leader of that party, said. \"If the salt was in an\naccessible place there would have been a salt lick there and goats in\nplenty.\"\n\n\"If woods goats care for salt the way Earth animals do,\" Lake said.\n\"When fall comes we'll make a salt lick and find out.\"\n\nTwo more weeks went by and Craig and Schroeder returned with their\nsurviving hunters. They had followed the game to the eastern end of the\nsnow-capped mountain range but there the migration had drawn away from\nthem, traveling farther each day than they could travel. They had almost\nwaited too long before turning back: the grass at the southern end of\nthe plateau was turning brown and the streams were dry. They got enough\nwater, barely, by digging seep holes in the dry stream beds.\n\nLake's method of stalking unicorns under the concealment of a woods goat\nskin had worked well only a few times. After that the unicorns learned\nto swing downwind from any lone woods goats. If they smelled a man\ninside the goat skin they charged him and killed him.\n\nWith the return of the last hunters everything was done that could be\ndone in preparation for summer. Inventory was taken of the total food\nsupply and it was even smaller than Lake had feared. It would be far\nfrom enough to last until fall brought the game back from the north and\nhe instituted rationing much stricter than before.\n\nThe heat increased as the yellow sun blazed hotter and the blue sun grew\nlarger. Each day the vegetation was browner and a morning came when Lake\ncould see no green wherever he looked.\n\nThey numbered eleven hundred and ten that morning, out of what had so\nrecently been four thousand. Eleven hundred and ten thin, hungry\nscarecrows who, already, could do nothing more than sit listlessly in\nthe shade and wait for the hell that was coming. He thought of the food\nsupply, so pitifully small, and of the months it would have to last. He\nsaw the grim, inescapable future for his charges: famine. There was\nnothing he could do to prevent it. He could only try to forestall\ncomplete starvation for all by cutting rations to the bare existence\nlevel.\n\nAnd that would be bare existence for the stronger of them. The weaker\nwere already doomed.\n\nHe had them all gather in front of the caves that evening when the\nterrace was in the shadow of the ridge. He stood before them and spoke\nto them:\n\n\"All of you know we have only a fraction of the amount of food we need\nto see us through the summer. Tomorrow the present ration will be cut in\nhalf. That will be enough to live on, just barely. If that cut isn't\nmade the food supply will be gone long before fall and all of us will\ndie.\n\n\"If anyone has any food of any kind it must be turned in to be added to\nthe total supply. Some of you may have thought of your children and\nkept a little hidden for them. I can understand why you should do\nthat--but you must turn it in. There may possibly be some who hid food\nfor themselves, personally. If so, I give them the first and last\nwarning: turn it in tonight. If any hidden cache of food is found in the\nfuture the one who hid it will be regarded as a traitor and murderer.\n\n\"All of you, but for the children, will go into the chamber next to the\none where the food is stored. Each of you--and there will be no\nexceptions regardless of how innocent you are--will carry a bulkily\nfolded cloth or garment. Each of you will go into the chamber alone.\nThere will be no one in there. You will leave the food you have folded\nin the cloth, if any, and go out the other exit and back to your caves.\nNo one will ever know whether the cloth you carried contained food or\nnot. No one will ever ask.\n\n\"Our survival on this world, if we are to survive at all, can be only by\nworking and sacrificing together. There can be no selfishness. What any\nof you may have done in the past is of no consequence. Tonight we start\nanew. From now on we trust one another without reserve.\n\n\"There will be one punishment for any who betray that trust--death.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnders set the example by being the first to carry a folded cloth into\nthe cave. Of them all, Lake heard later, only Bemmon voiced any real\nindignation; warning all those in his section of the line that the order\nwas the first step toward outright dictatorship and a police-and-spy\nsystem in which Lake and the other leaders would deprive them all of\nfreedom and dignity. Bemmon insisted upon exhibiting the emptiness of\nthe cloth he carried; an action that, had he succeeded in persuading the\nothers to follow his example, would have mercilessly exposed those who\ndid have food they were returning.\n\nBut no one followed Bemmon's example and no harm was done. As for Lake,\nhe had worries on his mind of much greater importance than Bemmon's\nenmity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe weeks dragged by, each longer and more terrible to endure than the\none before it as the heat steadily increased. Summer solstice arrived\nand there was no escape from the heat, even in the deepest caves. There\nwas no night; the blue sun rose in the east as the yellow sun set in the\nwest. There was no life of any kind to be seen, not even an insect.\nNothing moved across the burned land but the swirling dust devils and\nshimmering, distorted mirages.\n\nThe death rate increased with appalling swiftness. The small supply of\ncanned and dehydrated milk, fruit and vegetables was reserved\nexclusively for the children but it was far insufficient in quantity.\nThe Ragnarok herbs prevented any recurrence of the fatal deficiency\ndisease but they provided virtually no nourishment to help fight the\nheat and gravity. The stronger of the children lay wasted and listless\non their pallets while the ones not so strong died each day.\n\nEach day thin and hollow-eyed mothers would come to plead with him to\nsave their children. \"... it would take so little to save his life....\nPlease--before it's too late....\"\n\nBut there was so little food left and the time was yet so long until\nfall would bring relief from the famine that he could only answer each\nof them with a grim and final \"No.\"\n\nAnd watch the last hope flicker and die in their eyes and watch them\nturn away, to go and sit for the last hours beside their children.\n\nBemmon became increasingly irritable and complaining as the rationing\nand heat made existence a misery; insisting that Lake and the others\nwere to blame for the food shortage, that their hunting efforts had been\nbungling and faint-hearted. And he implied, without actually saying so,\nthat Lake and the others had forbidden him to go near the food chamber\nbecause they did not want a competent, honest man to check up on what\nthey were doing.\n\nThere were six hundred and three of them the blazing afternoon when the\ngirl, Julia, could stand his constant, vindictive, fault-finding no\nlonger. Lake heard about it shortly afterward, the way she had turned on\nBemmon in a flare of temper she could control no longer and said:\n\n\"Whenever your mouth is still you can hear the children who are dying\ntoday--but you don't care. All you can think of is yourself. You claim\nLake and the others were cowards--but you didn't dare hunt with them.\nYou keep insinuating that they're cheating us and eating more than we\nare--but your belly is the only one that has any fat left on it----\"\n\nShe never completed the sentence. Bemmon's face turned livid in sudden,\nwild fury and he struck her, knocking her against the rock wall so hard\nthat she slumped unconscious to the ground.\n\n\"She's a liar!\" he panted, glaring at the others. \"She's a rotten liar\nand anybody who repeats what she said will get what she got!\"\n\nWhen Lake learned of what had happened he did not send for Bemmon at\nonce. He wondered why Bemmon's reaction had been so quick and violent\nand there seemed to be only one answer:\n\nBemmon's belly was still a little fat. There could be but one way he\ncould have kept it so.\n\nHe summoned Craig, Schroeder, Barber and Anders. They went to the\nchamber where Bemmon slept and there, almost at once, they found his\ncache. He had it buried under his pallet and hidden in cavities along\nthe walls; dried meat, dried fruits and milk, canned vegetables. It was\nan amount amazingly large and many of the items had presumably been\nexhausted during the deficiency disease attack.\n\n\"It looks,\" Schroeder said, \"like he didn't waste any time feathering\nhis nest when he made himself leader.\"\n\nThe others said nothing but stood with grim, frozen faces, waiting for\nLake's next action.\n\n\"Bring Bemmon,\" Lake said to Craig.\n\nCraig returned with him two minutes later. Bemmon stiffened at the sight\nof his unearthed cache and color drained away from his face.\n\n\"Well?\" Lake asked.\n\n\"I didn't\"--Bemmon swallowed--\"I didn't know it was there.\" And then\nquickly, \"You can't prove I put it there. You can't prove you didn't\njust now bring it in yourselves to frame me.\"\n\nLake stared at Bemmon, waiting. The others watched Bemmon as Lake was\ndoing and no one spoke. The silence deepened and Bemmon began to sweat\nas he tried to avoid their eyes. He looked again at the damning evidence\nand his defiance broke.\n\n\"It--if I hadn't taken it it would have been wasted on people who were\ndying,\" he said. He wiped at his sweating face. \"I won't ever do it\nagain--I swear I won't.\"\n\nLake spoke to Craig. \"You and Barber take him to the lookout point.\"\n\n\"What----\" Bemmon's protest was cut off as Craig and Barber took him by\nthe arms and walked him swiftly away.\n\nLake turned to Anders. \"Get a rope,\" he ordered.\n\nAnders paled a little. \"A--rope?\"\n\n\"What else does he deserve?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Anders said. \"Not--not after what he did.\"\n\nOn the way out they passed the place where Julia lay. Bemmon had knocked\nher against the wall with such force that a sharp projection of rock had\ncut a deep gash in her forehead. A woman was wiping the blood from her\nface and she lay limply, still unconscious; a frail shadow of the bold\ngirl she had once been with the new life she would try to give them an\nalmost unnoticeable little bulge in her starved thinness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lookout point was an outjutting spur of the ridge, six hundred feet\nfrom the caves and in full view of them. A lone tree stood there, its\ndead limbs thrust like white arms through the brown foliage of the limbs\nthat still lived. Craig and Barber waited under the tree, Bemmon between\nthem. The lowering sun shone hot and bright on Bemmon's face as he\nsquinted back toward the caves at the approach of Lake and the other\ntwo.\n\nHe twisted to look at Barber. \"What is it--why did you bring me here?\"\nThere was the tremor of fear in his voice. \"What are you going to do to\nme?\"\n\nBarber did not answer and Bemmon turned back toward Lake. He saw the\nrope in Anders' hand and his face went white with comprehension.\n\n\"No!\"\n\nHe threw himself back with a violence that almost tore him loose.\n_\"No--no!\"_\n\nSchroeder stepped forward to help hold him and Lake took the rope from\nAnders. He fashioned a noose in it while Bemmon struggled and made\npanting, animal sounds, his eyes fixed in horrified fascination on the\nrope.\n\nWhen the noose was finished he threw the free end of the rope over the\nwhite limb above Bemmon. He released the noose and Barber caught it, to\ndraw it snug around Bemmon's neck.\n\nBemmon stopped struggling then and sagged weakly. For a moment it\nappeared that he would faint. Then he worked his mouth soundlessly until\nwords came:\n\n\"You won't--you can't--really hang me?\"\n\nLake spoke to him:\n\n\"We're going to hang you. What you stole would have saved the lives of\nten children. You've watched the children cry because they were so\nhungry and you've watched them become too weak to cry or care any more.\nYou've watched them die each day and each night you've secretly eaten\nthe food that was supposed to be theirs.\n\n\"We're going to hang you, for the murder of children and the betrayal of\nour trust in you. If you have anything to say, say it now.\"\n\n\"You can't! I had a right to live--to eat what would have been wasted on\ndying people!\" Bemmon twisted to appeal to the ones who held him, his\nwords quick and ragged with hysteria. \"You can't hang me--I don't want\nto die!\"\n\nCraig answered him, with a smile that was like the thin snarl of a wolf:\n\n\"Neither did two of my children.\"\n\nLake nodded to Craig and Schroeder, not waiting any longer. They stepped\nback to seize the free end of the rope and Bemmon screamed at what was\ncoming, tearing loose from the grip of Barber.\n\nThen his scream was abruptly cut off as he was jerked into the air.\nThere was a cracking sound and he kicked spasmodically, his head\nsetting grotesquely to one side.\n\nCraig and Schroeder and Barber watched him with hard, expressionless\nfaces but Anders turned quickly away, to be suddenly and violently sick.\n\n\"He was the first to betray us,\" Lake said. \"Snub the rope and leave him\nto swing there. If there are any others like him, they'll know what to\nexpect.\"\n\nThe blue sun rose as they went back to the caves. Behind them Bemmon\nswung and twirled aimlessly on the end of the rope. Two long, pale\nshadows swung and twirled with him; a yellow one to the west and a blue\none to the east.\n\nBemmon was buried the next day. Someone cursed his name and someone spit\non his grave and then he was part of the dead past as they faced the\nsuffering ahead of them.\n\nJulia recovered, although she would always wear a ragged scar on her\nforehead. Anders, who had worked closely with Chiara and was trying to\ntake his place, quieted her fears by assuring her that the baby she\ncarried was still too small for there to be much danger of the fall\ncausing her to lose it.\n\nThree times during the next month the wind came roaring down out of the\nnorthwest, bringing a gray dust that filled the sky and enveloped the\nland in a hot, smothering gloom through which the suns could not be\nseen.\n\nOnce black clouds gathered in the distance, to pour out a cloudburst.\nThe 1.5 gravity gave the wall of water that swept down the canyon a far\ngreater force and velocity than it would have had on Earth and boulders\nthe size of small houses were tossed into the air and shattered into\nfragments. But all the rain fell upon the one small area and not a drop\nfell at the caves.\n\nOne single factor was in their favor and but for it they could not have\nsurvived such intense, continual heat: there was no humidity. Water\nevaporated quickly in the hot, dry air and sweat glands operated at the\nhighest possible degree of efficiency. As a result they drank enormous\nquantities of water--the average adult needed five gallons a day. All\ncanvas had been converted into water bags and the same principle of\ncooling-by-evaporation gave them water that was only warm instead of\nsickeningly hot as it would otherwise have been.\n\nBut despite the lack of humidity the heat was still far more intense\nthan any on Earth. It never ceased, day or night, never let them have a\nmoment's relief. There was a limit to how long human flesh could bear up\nunder it, no matter how valiant the will. Each day the toll of those who\nhad reached that limit was greater, like a swiftly rising tide.\n\nThere were three hundred and forty of them, when the first rain came;\nthe rain that meant the end of summer. The yellow sun moved southward\nand the blue sun shrank steadily. Grass grew again and the woods goats\nreturned, with them the young that had been born in the north, already\nhalf the size of their mothers.\n\nFor a while there was meat, and green herbs. Then the prowlers came, to\nmake hunting dangerous. Females with pups were seen but always at a\ngreat distance as though the prowlers, like humans, took no chances with\nthe lives of their children.\n\nThe unicorns came close behind the first prowlers, their young amazingly\nlarge and already weaned. Hunting became doubly dangerous then but the\nbowmen, through necessity, were learning how to use their bows with\nincreasing skill and deadliness.\n\nA salt lick for the woods goats was hopefully tried, although Lake felt\ndubious about it. They learned that salt was something the woods goats\ncould either take or leave alone. And when hunters were in the vicinity\nthey left it alone.\n\nThe game was followed for many miles to the south. The hunters returned\nthe day the first blizzard came roaring and screaming down over the edge\nof the plateau; the blizzard that marked the beginning of the long,\nfrigid winter. By then they were prepared as best they could be. Wood\nhad been carried in great quantities and the caves fitted with crude\ndoors and a ventilation system. And they had meat--not as much as they\nwould need but enough to prevent starvation.\n\nLake took inventory of the food supply when the last hunters returned\nand held check-up inventories at irregular and unannounced intervals. He\nfound no shortages. He had expected none--Bemmon's grave had long since\nbeen obliterated by drifting snow but the rope still hung from the dead\nlimb, the noose swinging and turning in the wind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnders had made a Ragnarok calendar that spring, from data given him by\nJohn Prentiss, and he had marked the corresponding Earth dates on it. By\na coincidence, Christmas came near the middle of the winter. There would\nbe the same rationing of food on Christmas day but little brown trees\nhad been cut for the children and decorated with such ornaments as could\nbe made from the materials at hand.\n\nThere was another blizzard roaring down off the plateau Christmas\nmorning; a white death that thundered and howled outside the caves at a\ntemperature of more than eighty degrees below zero. But inside the caves\nit was warm by the fires and under the little brown trees were toys that\nhad been patiently whittled from wood or sewn from scraps of cloth and\nanimal skins while the children slept. They were crude and humble toys\nbut the pale, thin faces of the children were bright with delight when\nthey beheld them.\n\nThere was the laughter of children at play, a sound that had not been\nheard for many months, and someone singing the old, old songs. For a few\nfleeting hours that day, for the first and last time on Ragnarok, there\nwas the magic of an Earth Christmas.\n\nThat night a child was born to Julia, on a pallet of dried grass and\nprowler skins. She asked for her baby before she died and they let her\nhave it.\n\n\"I wasn't afraid, was I?\" she asked. \"But I wish it wasn't so dark--I\nwish I could see my baby before I go.\"\n\nThey took the baby from her arms when she was gone and removed from it\nthe blanket that had kept her from learning that her child was\nstill-born.\n\nThere were two hundred and fifty of them when the first violent storms\nof spring came. By then eighteen children had been born. Sixteen were\nstill-born, eight of them deformed by the gravity, but two were like any\nnormal babies on Earth. There was only one difference: the 1.5 gravity\ndid not seem to affect them as much as it had the Earth-born babies.\n\nLake, himself, married that spring; a tall, gray-eyed girl who had\nfought alongside the men the night of the storm when the prowlers broke\ninto John Prentiss's camp. And Schroeder married, the last of them all\nto do so.\n\nThat spring Lake sent out two classes of bowmen: those who would use the\nordinary short bow and those who would use the longbows he had had made\nthat winter. According to history the English longbowmen of medieval\ntimes had been without equal in the range and accuracy of their arrows\nand such extra-powerful weapons should eliminate close range stalking of\nwoods goats and afford better protection from unicorns.\n\nThe longbows worked so well that by mid-spring he could detach Craig and\nthree others from the hunting and send them on a prospecting expedition.\nPrentiss had said Ragnarok was devoid of metals but there was the hope\nof finding small veins the Dunbar Expedition's instruments had not\ndetected. They would have to find metal or else, in the end, they would\ngo back into a flint axe stage.\n\nCraig and his men returned when the blue star was a sun again and the\nheat was more than men could walk and work in. They had traveled\nhundreds of miles in their circuit and found no metals.\n\n\"I want to look to the south when fall comes,\" Craig said. \"Maybe it\nwill be different down there.\"\n\nThey did not face famine that summer as they had the first summer. The\ndiet of meat and dried herbs was rough and plain but there was enough of\nit.\n\nFull summer came and the land was again burned and lifeless. There was\nnothing to do but sit wearily in the shade and endure the heat, drawing\nwhat psychological comfort they could from the fact that summer solstice\nwas past and the suns were creeping south again even though it would be\nmany weeks before there was any lessening of the heat.\n\nIt was then, and by accident, that Lake discovered there was something\nwrong about the southward movement of the suns.\n\nHe was returning from the lookout that day and he realized it was\nexactly a year since he and the others had walked back to the caves\nwhile Bemmon swung on the limb behind them.\n\nIt was even the same time of day; the blue sun rising in the east behind\nhim and the yellow sun bright in his face as it touched the western\nhorizon before him. He remembered how the yellow sun had been like the\nfront sight of a rifle, set in the deepest V notch of the western\nhills--\n\nBut now, exactly a year later, it was not in the V notch. It was on the\nnorth side of the notch.\n\nHe looked to the east, at the blue sun. It seemed to him that it, too,\nwas farther north than it had been although with it he had no landmark\nto check by.\n\nBut there was no doubt about the yellow sun: it was going south, as it\nshould at that time of year, but it was lagging behind schedule. The\nonly explanation Lake could think of was one that would mean still\nanother threat to their survival; perhaps greater than all the others\ncombined.\n\nThe yellow sun dropped completely behind the north slope of the V notch\nand he went on to the caves. He found Craig and Anders, the only two who\nmight know anything about Ragnarok's axial tilts, and told them what he\nhad seen.\n\n\"I made the calendar from the data John gave me,\" Anders said. \"The\nDunbar men made observations and computed the length of Ragnarok's\nyear--I don't think they would have made any mistakes.\"\n\n\"If they didn't,\" Lake said, \"we're in for something.\"\n\nCraig was watching him, closely, thoughtfully. \"Like the Ice Ages of\nEarth?\" he asked.\n\nLake nodded and Anders said, \"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Each year the north pole tilts toward the sun to give us summer and\naway from it to give us winter,\" Lake said. \"Which, of course, you\nknow. But there can be still another kind of axial tilt. On Earth it\noccurs at intervals of thousands of years. The tilting that produces the\nsummers and winters goes on as usual but as the centuries go by the\nsummer tilt toward the sun grows less, the winter tilt away from it\ngreater. The north pole leans farther and farther from the sun and ice\nsheets come down out of the north--an Ice Age. Then the north pole's\nprogression away from the sun stops and the ice sheets recede as it\ntilts back toward the sun.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Anders said. \"And if the same thing is happening here, we're\ngoing away from an ice age but at a rate thousands of times faster than\non Earth.\"\n\n\"I don't know whether it's Ragnarok's tilt, alone, or if the orbits of\nthe suns around each other add effects of their own over a period of\nyears,\" Lake said. \"The Dunbar Expedition wasn't here long enough to\ncheck up on anything like that.\"\n\n\"It seemed to me it was hotter this summer than last,\" Craig said.\n\"Maybe only my imagination--but it won't be imagination in a few years\nif the tilt toward the sun continues.\"\n\n\"The time would come when we'd have to leave here,\" Lake said. \"We'd\nhave to go north up the plateau each spring. There's no timber\nthere--nothing but grass and wind and thin air. We'd have to migrate\nsouth each fall.\"\n\n\"Yes ... migrate.\" Anders's face was old and weary in the harsh\nreflected light of the blue sun and his hair had turned almost white in\nthe past year. \"Only the young ones could ever adapt enough to go up the\nplateau to its north portion. The rest of us ... but we haven't many\nyears, anyway. Ragnarok is for the young--and if they have to migrate\nback and forth like animals just to stay alive they will never have time\nto accomplish anything or be more than stone age nomads.\"\n\n\"I wish we could know how long the Big Summer will be that we're going\ninto,\" Craig said. \"And how long and cold the Big Winter, when Ragnarok\ntilts away from the sun. It wouldn't change anything--but I'd like to\nknow.\"\n\n\"We'll start making and recording daily observations,\" Lake said.\n\"Maybe the tilt will start back the other way before it's too late.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFall seemed to come a little later that year. Craig went to the south as\nsoon as the weather permitted but there were no minerals there; only the\nmetal-barren hills dwindling in size until they became a prairie that\nsloped down and down toward the southern lowlands where all the\ncreatures of Ragnarok spent the winter.\n\n\"I'll try again to the north when spring comes,\" Craig said. \"Maybe that\nmountain on the plateau will have something.\"\n\nWinter came, and Elaine died in giving him a son. The loss of Elaine was\nan unexpected blow; hurting more than he would ever have thought\npossible.\n\nBut he had a son ... and it was his responsibility to do whatever he\ncould to insure the survival of his son and of the sons and daughters of\nall the others.\n\nHis outlook altered and he began to think of the future, not in terms of\nyears to come but in terms of generations to come. Someday one of the\nyoung ones would succeed him as leader but the young ones would have\nonly childhood memories of Earth. He was the last leader who had known\nEarth and the civilization of Earth as a grown man. What he did while he\nwas leader would incline the destiny of a new race.\n\nHe would have to do whatever was possible for him to do and he would\nhave to begin at once. The years left to him could not be many.\n\nHe was not alone; others in the caves had the same thoughts he had\nregarding the future even though none of them had any plan for\naccomplishing what they spoke of. West, who had held degrees in\nphilosophy on Earth, said to Lake one night as they sat together by the\nfire:\n\n\"Have you noticed the way the children listen when the talk turns to\nwhat used to be on Earth, what might have been on Athena, and what would\nbe if only we could find a way to escape from Ragnarok?\"\n\n\"I've noticed,\" he said.\n\n\"These stories already contain the goal for the future generations,\"\nWest went on. \"Someday, somehow, they will go to Athena, to kill the\nGerns there and free the Terran slaves and reclaim Athena as their own.\"\n\nHe had listened to them talk of the interstellar flight to Athena as\nthey sat by their fires and worked at making bows and arrows. It was\nonly a dream they held, yet without that dream there would be nothing\nbefore them but the vision of generation after generation living and\ndying on a world that could never give them more than existence.\n\nThe dream was needed. But it, alone, was not enough. How long, on Earth,\nhad it been from the Neolithic age to advanced civilization--how long\nfrom the time men were ready to leave their caves until they were ready\nto go to the stars?\n\nTwelve thousand years.\n\nThere were men and women among the Rejects who had been specialists in\nvarious fields. There were a few books that had survived the trampling\nof the unicorns and others could be written with ink made from the black\nlance tree bark upon parchment made from the thin inner skin of unicorn\nhides.\n\nThe knowledge contained in the books and the learning of the Rejects\nstill living should be preserved for the future generations. With the\nhelp of that learning perhaps they really could, someday, somehow,\nescape from their prison and make Athena their own.\n\nHe told West of what he had been thinking. \"We'll have to start a\nschool,\" he said. \"This winter--tomorrow.\"\n\nWest nodded in agreement. \"And the writings should be commenced as soon\nas possible. Some of the textbooks will require more time to write than\nRagnarok will give the authors.\"\n\nA school for the children was started the next day and the writing of\nthe books began. The parchment books would serve two purposes. One would\nbe to teach the future generations things that would not only help them\nsurvive but would help them create a culture of their own as advanced as\nthe harsh environment and scanty resources of Ragnarok permitted. The\nother would be to warn them of the danger of a return of the Gerns and\nto teach them all that was known about Gerns and their weapons.\n\nLake's main contribution would be a lengthy book: TERRAN SPACESHIPS;\nTYPES AND OPERATION. He postponed its writing, however, to first produce\na much smaller book but one that might well be more important: INTERIOR\nFEATURES OF A GERN CRUISER. Terran Intelligence knew a little about Gern\ncruisers and as second-in-command of the _Constellation_ he had seen and\nstudied a copy of that report. He had an excellent memory for such\nthings, almost photographic, and he wrote the text and drew a multitude\nof sketches.\n\nHe shook his head ruefully at the result. The text was good but, for\nclarity, the accompanying illustrations should be accurate and in\nperspective. And he was definitely not an artist.\n\nHe discovered that Craig could take a pen in his scarred, powerful hand\nand draw with the neat precision of a professional artist. He turned the\nsketches over to him, together with the mass of specifications. Since it\nmight someday be of such vital importance, he would make four copies of\nit. The text was given to a teen-age girl, who would make three more\ncopies of it....\n\nFour days later Schroeder handed Lake a text with some rough sketches.\nThe title was: OPERATION OF GERN BLASTERS.\n\nNot even Intelligence had ever been able to examine a Gern hand blaster.\nBut a man named Schrader, on Venus, had killed a Gern with his own\nblaster and then disappeared with both infuriated Gerns and\nGern-intimidated Venusian police in pursuit. There had been a high\nreward for his capture....\n\nHe looked it over and said, \"I was counting on you giving us this.\"\n\nOnly the barest trace of surprise showed on Schroeder's face but his\neyes were intently watching Lake. \"So you knew all the time who I was?\"\n\n\"I knew.\"\n\n\"Did anyone else on the _Constellation_ know?\"\n\n\"You were recognized by one of the ship's officers. You would have been\ntried in two more days.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Schroeder said. \"And since I was guilty and couldn't be\nreturned to Earth or Venus I'd have been executed on the _Constellation_.\"\nHe smiled sardonically. \"And you, as second-in-command, would have been my\nexecution's master of ceremonies.\"\n\nLake put the parchment sheets back together in their proper order.\n\"Sometimes,\" he said, \"a ship's officer has to do things that are\ncontrary to all his own wishes.\"\n\nSchroeder drew a deep breath, his face sombre with the memories he had\nkept to himself.\n\n\"It was two years ago when the Gerns were still talking friendship to\nthe Earth government while they shoved the colonists around on Venus.\nThis Gern ... there was a girl there and he thought he could do what he\nwanted to her because he was a mighty Gern and she was nothing. He did.\nThat's why I killed him. I had to kill two Venusian police to get\naway--that's where I put the rope around my neck.\"\n\n\"It's not what we did but what we do that we'll live or die by on\nRagnarok,\" Lake said. He handed Schroeder the sheets of parchment. \"Tell\nCraig to make at least four copies of this. Someday our knowledge of\nGern blasters may be something else we'll live or die by.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe school and writing were interrupted by the spring hunting. Craig\nmade his journey to the Plateau's snow-capped mountain but he was unable\nto keep his promise to prospect it. The plateau was perhaps ten thousand\nfeet in elevation and the mountain rose another ten thousand feet above\nthe plateau. No human could climb such a mountain in a 1.5 gravity.\n\n\"I tried,\" he told Lake wearily when he came back. \"Damn it, I never\ntried harder at anything in my life. It was just too much for me. Maybe\nsome of the young ones will be better adapted and can do it when they\ngrow up.\"\n\nCraig brought back several sheets of unusually transparent mica, each\nsheet a foot in diameter, and a dozen large water-clear quartz crystals.\n\n\"Float, from higher up on the mountain,\" he said. \"The mica and crystals\nare in place up there if we could only reach them. Other minerals,\ntoo--I panned traces in the canyon bottoms. But no iron.\"\n\nLake examined the sheets of mica. \"We could make windows for the outer\ncaves of these,\" he said. \"Have them double thickness with a wide air\nspace between, for insulation. As for the quartz crystals....\"\n\n\"Optical instruments,\" Craig said. \"Binoculars, microscopes--it would\ntake us a long time to learn how to make glass as clear and flawless as\nthose crystals. But we have no way of cutting and grinding them.\"\n\nCraig went to the east that fall and to the west the next spring. He\nreturned from the trip to the west with a twisted knee that would never\nlet him go prospecting again.\n\n\"It will take years to find the metals we need,\" he said. \"The\nindications are that we never will but I wanted to keep on trying. Now,\nmy damned knee has me chained to these caves....\"\n\nHe reconciled himself to his lameness and confinement as best he could\nand finished his textbook: GEOLOGY AND MINERAL IDENTIFICATION.\n\nHe also taught a geology class during the winters. It was in the winter\nof the year four on Ragnarok that a nine-year-old boy entered his class;\nthe silent, scar-faced Billy Humbolt.\n\nHe was by far the youngest of Craig's students, and the most attentive.\nLake was present one day when Craig asked, curiously:\n\n\"It's not often a boy your age is so interested in mineralogy and\ngeology, Billy. Is there something more than just interest?\"\n\n\"I have to learn all about minerals,\" Billy said with matter-of-fact\nseriousness, \"so that when I'm grown I can find the metals for us to\nmake a ship.\"\n\n\"And then?\" Craig asked.\n\n\"And then we'd go to Athena, to kill the Gerns who caused my mother to\ndie, and my grandfather, and Julia, and all the others. And to free my\nfather and the other slaves if they're still alive.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Craig said.\n\nHe did not smile. His face was shadowed and old as he looked at the boy\nand beyond him; seeing again, perhaps, the frail blonde girl and the two\nchildren that the first quick, violent months had taken from him.\n\n\"I hope you succeed,\" he said. \"I wish I was young so I could dream of\nthe same thing. But I'm not ... so let's get back to the identification\nof the ores that will be needed to make a ship to go to Athena and to\nmake blasters to kill Gerns after you get there.\"\n\nLake had a corral built early the following spring, with camouflaged\nwings, to trap some of the woods goats when they came. It would be an\nimmense forward step toward conquering their new environment if they\ncould domesticate the goats and have goat herds near the caves all\nthrough the year. Gathering enough grass to last a herd of goats through\nthe winter would be a problem--but first, before they worried about\nthat, they would have to see if the goats could survive the summer and\nwinter extremes of heat and cold.\n\nThey trapped ten goats that spring. They built them brush\nsunshades--before summer was over the winds would have stripped the\ntrees of most of their dry, brown leaves--and a stream of water was\ndiverted through the corral.\n\nIt was all work in vain. The goats died from the heat in early summer,\ntogether with the young that had been born.\n\nWhen fall came they trapped six more goats. They built them shelters\nthat would be as warm as possible and carried them a large supply of the\ntall grass from along the creek banks; enough to last them through the\nwinter. But the cold was too much for the goats and the second blizzard\nkilled them all.\n\nThe next spring and fall, and with much more difficulty, they tried the\nexperiment with pairs of unicorns. The results were the same.\n\nWhich meant they would remain a race of hunters. Ragnarok would not\npermit them to be herdsmen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe years went by, each much like the one before it but for the rapid\naging of the Old Ones, as Lake and the others called themselves, and the\ngrowing up of the Young Ones. No woman among the Old Ones could any\nlonger have children, but six more normal, healthy children had been\nborn. Like the first two, they were not affected by the gravity as\nEarth-born babies had been.\n\nAmong the Young Ones, Lake saw, was a distinguishable difference. Those\nwho had been very young the day the Gerns left them to die had adapted\nbetter than those who had been a few years older.\n\nThe environment of Ragnarok had struck at the very young with merciless\nsavagery. It had subjected them to a test of survival that was without\nprecedent on Earth. It had killed them by the hundreds but among them\nhad been those whose young flesh and blood and organs had resisted death\nby adapting to the greatest extent possible.\n\nThe day of the Old Ones was almost done and the future would soon be in\nthe hands of the Young Ones. They were the ninety unconquerables out of\nwhat had been four thousand Rejects; the first generation of what would\nbe a new race.\n\nIt seemed to Lake that the years came and went ever faster as the Old\nOnes dwindled in numbers at an accelerating rate. Anders had died in the\nsixth year, his heart failing him one night as he worked patiently in\nhis crude little laboratory at carrying on the work started by Chiara to\nfind a cure for the Hell Fever. Barber, trying to develop a strain of\nherbs that would grow in the lower elevation of the caves, was killed by\na unicorn as he worked in his test plot below the caves. Craig went\nlimping out one spring day on the eighth year to look at a new mineral a\nhunter had found a mile from the caves. A sudden cold rain blew up,\nchilling him before he could return, and he died of Hell Fever the same\nday.\n\nSchroeder was killed by prowlers the same year, dying with his back to a\ntree and a bloody knife in his hand. It was the way he would have wanted\nto go--once he had said to Lake:\n\n\"When my times comes I would rather it be against the prowlers. They\nfight hard and kill quick and then they're through with you. They don't\ntear you up after you're dead and slobber and gloat over the pieces, the\nway the unicorns do.\"\n\nThe springs came a little earlier each year, the falls a little later,\nand the observations showed the suns progressing steadily northward. But\nthe winters, though shorter, were seemingly as cold as ever. The long\nsummers reached such a degree of heat on the ninth year that Lake knew\nthey could endure no more than two or three years more of the increasing\nheat.\n\nThen, in the summer of the tenth year, the tilting of Ragnarok--the\napparent northward progress of the suns--stopped. They were in the\nmiddle of what Craig had called Big Summer and they could endure\nit--just barely. They would not have to leave the caves.\n\nThe suns started their drift southward. The observations were continued\nand carefully recorded. Big Fall was coming and behind it would be Big\nWinter.\n\nBig Winter ... the threat of it worried Lake. How far to the south would\nthe suns go--how long would they stay? Would the time come when the\nplateau would be buried under hundreds of feet of snow and the caves\nenclosed in glacial ice?\n\nThere was no way he could ever know or even guess. Only those of the\nfuture would ever know.\n\nOn the twelfth year only Lake and West were left of the Old Ones. By\nthen there were eighty-three left of the Young Ones, eight Ragnarok-born\nchildren of the Old Ones and four Ragnarok-born children of the Young\nOnes. Not counting himself and West, there were ninety-five of them.\n\nIt was not many to be the beginnings of a race that would face an ice\nage of unknown proportions and have over them, always, the threat of a\nchance return of the Gerns.\n\nThe winter of the fifteenth year came and he was truly alone, the last\nof the Old Ones. White-haired and aged far beyond his years, he was\nstill leader. But that winter he could do little other than sit by his\nfire and feel the gravity dragging at his heart. He knew, long before\nspring, that it was time he chose his successor.\n\nHe had hoped to live to see his son take his place--but Jim was only\nthirteen. Among the others was one he had been watching since the day he\ntold Craig he would find metals to build a ship and kill the Gerns:\nBill Humbolt.\n\nBill Humbolt was not the oldest among those who would make leaders but\nhe was the most versatile of them all, the most thoughtful and\nstubbornly determined. He reminded Lake of that fierce old man who had\nbeen his grandfather and had it not been for the scars that twisted his\nface into grim ugliness he would have looked much like him.\n\nA violent storm was roaring outside the caves the night he told the\nothers that he wanted Bill Humbolt to be his successor. There were no\nobjections and, without ceremony and with few words, he terminated his\nfifteen years of leadership.\n\nHe left the others, his son among them, and went back to the cave where\nhe slept. His fire was low, down to dying embers, but he was too tired\nto build it up again. He lay down on his pallet and saw, with neither\nsurprise nor fear, that his time was much nearer than he had thought. It\nwas already at hand.\n\nHe lay back and let the lassitude enclose him, not fighting it. He had\ndone the best he could for the others and now the weary journey was\nover.\n\nHis thoughts dissolved into the memory of the day fifteen years before.\nThe roaring of the storm became the thunder of the Gern cruisers as they\ndisappeared into the gray sky. Four thousand Rejects stood in the cold\nwind and watched them go, the children not yet understanding that they\nhad been condemned to die. Somehow, his own son was among them----\n\nHe tried feebly to rise. There was work to do--a lot of work to do....\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                 PART 2\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nIt was early morning as Bill Humbolt sat by the fire in his cave and\nstudied the map Craig had made of the plateau's mountain. Craig had left\nthe mountain nameless and he dipped his pen in ink to write: _Craig\nMountains_.\n\n\"Bill----\"\n\nDelmont Anders entered very quietly, what he had to tell already evident\non his face.\n\n\"He died last night, Bill.\"\n\nIt was something he had been expecting to come at any time but the lack\nof surprise did not diminish the sense of loss. Lake had been the last\nof the Old Ones, the last of those who had worked and fought and\nshortened the years of their lives that the Young Ones might have a\nchance to live. Now he was gone--now a brief era was ended, a valiant,\nbloody chapter written and finished.\n\nAnd he was the new leader who would decree how the next chapter should\nbe written, only four years older than the boy who was looking at him\nwith an unconscious appeal for reassurance on his face....\n\n\"You'd better tell Jim,\" he said. \"Then, a little later, I want to talk\nto everyone about the things we'll start doing as soon as spring comes.\"\n\n\"You mean, the hunting?\" Delmont asked.\n\n\"No--more than just the hunting.\"\n\nHe sat for a while after Delmont left, looking back down the years that\nhad preceded that day, back to that first morning on Ragnarok.\n\nHe had set a goal for himself that morning when he left his toy bear in\nthe dust behind him and walked beside Julia into the new and perilous\nway of life. He had promised himself that some day he would watch the\nGerns die and beg for mercy as they died and he would give them the same\nmercy they had given his mother.\n\nAs he grew older he realized that his hatred, alone, was a futile thing.\nThere would have to be a way of leaving Ragnarok and there would have to\nbe weapons with which to fight the Gerns. These would be things\nimpossible and beyond his reach unless he had the help of all the others\nin united, coordinated effort.\n\nTo make certain of that united effort he would have to be their leader.\nSo for eleven years he had studied and trained until there was no one\nwho could use a bow or spear quite as well as he could, no one who could\ntravel as far in a day or spot a unicorn ambush as quickly. And there\nwas no one, with the exception of George Ord, who had studied as many\ntextbooks as he had.\n\nHe had reached his first goal--he was leader. For all of them there\nexisted the second goal: the hope of someday leaving Ragnarok and taking\nAthena from the Gerns. For many of them, perhaps, it was only wishful\ndreaming but for him it was the prime driving force of his life.\n\nThere was so much for them to do and their lives were so short in which\nto do it. For so long as he was leader they would not waste a day in\nidle wishing....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the others were gathered to hear what he had to say he spoke to\nthem:\n\n\"We're going to continue where the Old Ones had to leave off. We're\nbetter adapted than they were and we're going to find metals to make a\nship if there are any to be found.\n\n\"Somewhere on Ragnarok, on the northwest side of a range similar to the\nCraig Mountains on the plateau, is a deep valley that the Dunbar\nExpedition called the Chasm. They didn't investigate it closely since\ntheir instruments showed no metals there but they saw strata in one\nplace that was red; an iron discoloration. Maybe we can find a vein\nthere that was too small for them to have paid any attention to. So\nwe'll go over the Craigs as soon as the snow melts from them.\"\n\n\"That will be in early summer,\" George Ord said, his black eyes\nthoughtful. \"Whoever goes will have to time their return for either just\nbefore the prowlers and unicorns come back from the north or wait until\nthey've all migrated down off the plateau.\"\n\nIt was something Humbolt had been thinking about and wishing they could\nremedy. Men could elude unicorn attacks wherever there were trees large\nenough to offer safety and even prowler attacks could be warded off\nwherever there were trees for refuge; spears holding back the prowlers\nwho would climb the trees while arrows picked off the ones on the\nground. But there were no trees on the plateau, and to be caught by a\nband of prowlers or unicorns there was certain death for any small party\nof two or three. For that reason no small parties had ever gone up on\nthe plateau except when the unicorns and prowlers were gone or nearly\nso. It was an inconvenience and it would continue for as long as their\nweapons were the slow-to-reload bows.\n\n\"You're supposed to be our combination inventor-craftsman,\" he said to\nGeorge. \"No one else can compare with you in that respect. Besides,\nyou're not exactly enthusiastic about such hard work as mountain\nclimbing. So from now on you'll do the kind of work you're best fitted\nfor. Your first job is to make us a better bow. Make it like a crossbow,\nwith a sliding action to draw and cock the string and with a magazine of\narrows mounted on top of it.\"\n\nGeorge studied the idea thoughtfully. \"The general principle is simple,\"\nhe said. \"I'll see what I can do.\"\n\n\"How many of us will go over the Craig Mountains, Bill?\" Dan Barber\nasked.\n\n\"You and I,\" Humbolt answered. \"A three-man party under Bob Craig will\ngo into the Western Hills and another party under Johnny Stevens will go\ninto the Eastern Hills.\"\n\nHe looked toward the adjoining cave where the guns had been stored for\nso long, coated with unicorn tallow to protect them from rust.\n\n\"We could make gun powder if we could find a deposit of saltpeter. We\nalready know where there's a little sulphur. The guns would have to be\nconverted to flintlocks, though, since we don't have what we need for\ncartridge priming material. Worse, we'd have to use ceramic bullets.\nThey would be inefficient--too light, and destructive to the bores. But\nwe would need powder for mining if we ever found any iron. And, if we\ncan't have metal bullets to shoot the Gerns, we can have bombs to blast\nthem with.\"\n\n\"Suppose,\" Johnny Stevens said, \"that we never do find the metals to\nmake a ship. How will we ever leave Ragnarok if that happens?\"\n\n\"There's another way--a possible way--of leaving here without a ship of\nour own. If there are no metals we'll have to try it.\"\n\n\"Why wait?\" Bob Craig demanded. \"Why not try it now?\"\n\n\"Because the odds would be about ten thousand to one in favor of the\nGerns. But we'll try it if everything else fails.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGeorge made, altered, and rejected four different types of crossbows\nbefore he perfected a reloading bow that met his critical approval. He\nbrought it to where Humbolt stood outside the caves early one spring day\nwhen the grass was sending up the first green shoots on the southern\nhillsides and the long winter was finally dying.\n\n\"Here it is,\" he said, handing Humbolt the bow. \"Try it.\"\n\nHe took it, noting the fine balance of it. Projecting down from the\ncenter of the bow, at right angles to it, was a stock shaped to fit the\ngrip of the left hand. Under the crossbar was a sliding stock for the\nright hand, shaped like the butt of a pistol and fitted with a trigger.\nMounted slightly above and to one side of the crossbar was a magazine\ncontaining ten short arrows.\n\nThe pistol grip was in position near the forestock. He pulled it back\nthe length of the crossbar and it brought the string with it, stretching\nit taut. There was a click as the trigger mechanism locked the bowstring\nin place and at the same time a concealed spring arrangement shoved an\narrow into place against the string.\n\nHe took quick aim at a distant tree and pressed the trigger. There was a\ntwang as the arrow was ejected. He jerked the sliding pistol grip\nforward and back to reload, pressing the trigger an instant later.\nAnother arrow went its way.\n\nBy the time he had fired the tenth arrow in the magazine he was shooting\nat the rate of one arrow per second. On the trunk of the distant tree,\nlike a bristle of stiff whiskers, the ten arrows were driven deep into\nthe wood in an area no larger than the chest of a prowler or head of a\nunicorn.\n\n\"This is better than I hoped for,\" he said to George. \"One man with one\nof these would equal six men with ordinary bows.\"\n\n\"I'm going to add another feature,\" George said. \"Bundles of arrows, ten\nto the bundle in special holders, to carry in the quivers. To reload the\nmagazine you'd just slap down a new bundle of arrows, in no more time\nthan it would take to put one arrow in an ordinary bow. I figured that\nwith practice a man should be able to get off forty arrows in not much\nmore than twenty seconds.\"\n\nGeorge took the bow and went back in the cave to add his new feature.\nHumbolt stared after him, thinking, _If he can make something like that\nout of wood and unicorn gut, what would he be able to give us if he\ncould have metal?_\n\nPerhaps George would never have the opportunity to show what he could do\nwith metal. But Humbolt already felt sure that George's genius would, if\nit ever became necessary, make possible the alternate plan for leaving\nRagnarok.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe weeks dragged into months and at last enough snow was gone from the\nCraigs that Humbolt and Dan Barber could start. They met no opposition.\nThe prowlers had long since disappeared into the north and the unicorns\nwere very scarce. They had no occasion to test the effectiveness of the\nnew automatic crossbows in combat; a lack of opportunity that irked\nBarber.\n\n\"Any other time, if we had ordinary bows,\" he complained, \"the unicorns\nwould be popping up to charge us from all directions.\"\n\n\"Don't fret,\" Humbolt consoled him. \"This fall, when we come back, they\nwill be.\"\n\nThey reached the mountain and stopped near its foot where a creek came\ndown, its water high and muddy with melting snows. There they hunted\nuntil they had obtained all the meat they could carry. They would see no\nmore game when they went up the mountain's canyons. A poisonous weed\nreplaced most of the grass in all the canyons and the animals of\nRagnarok had learned long before to shun the mountain.\n\nThey found the canyon that Craig and his men had tried to explore and\nstarted up it. It was there that Craig had discovered the quartz and\nmica and so far as he had been able to tell the head of that canyon\nwould be the lowest of all the passes over the mountain.\n\nThe canyon went up the mountain diagonally so that the climb was not\nsteep although it was constant. They began to see mica and quartz\ncrystals in the creek bed and at noon on the second day they passed the\nlast stunted tree. Nothing grew higher than that point but the thorny\npoison weeds and they were scarce.\n\nThe air was noticeably thinner there and their burdens heavier. A short\ndistance beyond they came to a small rock monument; Craig's turn-back\npoint.\n\nThe next day they found the quartz crystals in place. A mile farther was\nthe vein the mica had come from. Of the other minerals Craig had hoped\nto find, however, there were only traces.\n\nThe fourth day was an eternity of struggling up the now-steeper canyon\nunder loads that seemed to weigh hundreds of pounds; forcing their\nprotesting legs to carry them fifty steps at a time, at the end of which\nthey would stop to rest while their lungs labored to suck in the thin\nair in quick, panting breaths.\n\nIt would have been much easier to have gone around the mountain. But the\nChasm was supposed to be like a huge cavity scooped out of the plateau\nbeyond the mountain, rimmed with sheer cliffs a mile high. Only on the\nside next to the mountain was there a slope leading down into it.\n\nThey stopped for the night where the creek ended in a small spring.\nThere the snow still clung to the canyon's walls and there the canyon\ncurved, offering them the promise of the summit just around the bend as\nit had been doing all day.\n\nThe sun was hot and bright the next morning as they made their slow way\non again. The canyon straightened, the steep walls of it flattening out\nto make a pair of ragged shoulders with a saddle between them.\n\nThey climbed to the summit of the saddle and there, suddenly before\nthem, was the other side of the world--and the Chasm.\n\nFar below them was a plateau, stretching endlessly like the one they had\nleft behind them. But the chasm dominated all else. It was a gigantic,\nsheer-walled valley, a hundred miles long by forty miles wide, sunk deep\nin the plateau with the tops of its mile-high walls level with the floor\nof the plateau. The mountain under them dropped swiftly away, sloping\ndown and down to the level of the plateau and then on, down and down\nagain, to the bottom of the chasm that was so deep its floor was half\nhidden by the morning shadows.\n\n\"My God!\" Barber said. \"It must be over three miles under us to the\nbottom, on the vertical. Ten miles of thirty-three per cent grade--if we\ngo down we'll never get out again.\"\n\n\"You can turn back here if you want to,\" Humbolt said.\n\n\"Turn back?\" Barber's red whiskers seemed to bristle. \"Who in hell said\nanything about turning back?\"\n\n\"Nobody,\" Humbolt said, smiling a little at Barber's quick flash of\nanger.\n\nHe studied the chasm, wishing that they could have some way of cutting\nthe quartz crystals and making binoculars. It was a long way to look\nwith the naked eye....\n\nHere and there the chasm thrust out arms into the plateau. All the arms\nwere short, however, and even at their heads the cliffs were vertical.\nThe morning shadows prevented a clear view of much of the chasm and he\ncould see no sign of the red-stained strata that they were searching\nfor.\n\nIn the southwest corner of the chasm, far away and almost imperceptible,\nhe saw a faint cloud rising up from the chasm's floor. It was impossible\nto tell what it was and it faded away as he watched.\n\nBarber saw it, too, and said, \"It looked like smoke. Do you suppose\nthere could be people--or some kind of intelligent things--living down\nthere?\"\n\n\"It might have been the vapor from hot springs, condensed by the cool\nmorning air,\" he said. \"Whatever it was, we'll look into it when we get\nthere.\"\n\nThe climb down the steep slope into the chasm was swifter than that up\nthe canyon but no more pleasant. Carrying a heavy pack down such a grade\nexerted a torturous strain upon the backs of the legs.\n\nThe heat increased steadily as they descended. They reached the floor of\nthe valley the next day and the noonday heat was so great that Humbolt\nwondered if they might not have trapped themselves into what the summer\nwould soon transform into a monstrous oven where no life at all could\nexist. There could never be any choice, of course--the mountains were\npassable only when the weather was hot.\n\nThe floor of the valley was silt, sand and gravel--they would find\nnothing there. They set out on a circuit of the chasm's walls, following\nalong close to the base.\n\nIn many places the mile-high walls were without a single ledge to break\ntheir vertical faces. When they came to the first such place they saw\nthat the ground near the base was riddled with queer little pits, like\ntiny craters of the moon. As they looked there was a crack like a cannon\nshot and the ground beside them erupted into an explosion of sand and\ngravel. When the dust had cleared away there was a new crater where none\nhad been before.\n\nHumbolt wiped the blood from his face where a flying fragment had cut it\nand said, \"The heat of the sun loosens rocks up on the rim. When one\nfalls a mile in a one point five gravity, it's traveling like a meteor.\"\n\n\nThey went on, through the danger zone. As with the peril of the chasm's\nheat, there was no choice. Only by observing the material that littered\nthe base of the cliffs could they know what minerals, if any, might be\nabove them.\n\nOn the fifteenth day they saw the red-stained stratum. Humbolt quickened\nhis pace, hurrying forward in advance of Barber. The stratum was too\nhigh up on the wall to be reached but it was not necessary to examine it\nin place--the base of the cliff was piled thick with fragments from it.\n\nHe felt the first touch of discouragement as he looked at them. They\nwere a sandstone, light in weight. The iron present was only what the\nDunbar Expedition had thought it to be; a mere discoloration.\n\nThey made their way slowly along the foot of the cliff, examining piece\nafter piece in the hope of finding something more than iron stains.\nThere was no variation, however, and a mile farther on they came to the\nend of the red stratum. Beyond that point the rocks were gray, without a\nvestige of iron.\n\n\"So that,\" Barber said, looking back the way they had come, \"is what we\nwere going to build a ship out of--iron stains!\"\n\nHumbolt did not answer. For him it was more than a disappointment. It\nwas the death of a dream he had held since the year he was nine and had\nheard that the Dunbar Expedition had seen iron-stained rock in a deep\nchasm--the only iron-stained rock on the face of Ragnarok. Surely, he\nhad thought, there would be enough iron there to build a small ship. For\neleven years he had worked toward the day when he would find it. Now, he\nhad found it--and it was nothing. The ship was as far away as ever....\n\nBut discouragement was as useless as iron-stained sandstone. He shook it\noff and turned to Barber.\n\n\"Let's go,\" he said. \"Maybe we'll find something by the time we circle\nthe chasm.\"\n\nFor seven days they risked the danger of death from downward plunging\nrocks and found nothing. On the eighth day they found the treasure that\nwas not treasure.\n\nThey stopped for the evening just within the mouth of one of the chasm's\ntributaries. Humbolt went out to get a drink where a trickle of water\nran through the sand and as he knelt down he saw the flash of something\nred under him, almost buried in the sand.\n\nHe lifted it out. It was a stone half the size of his hand; darkly\ntranslucent and glowing in the light of the setting sun like blood.\n\nIt was a ruby.\n\nHe looked, and saw another gleam a little farther up the stream. It was\nanother ruby, almost as large as the first one. Near it was a flawless\nblue sapphire. Scattered here and there were smaller rubies and\nsapphires, down to the size of grains of sand.\n\nHe went farther upstream and saw specimens of still another stone. They\nwere colorless but burning with internal fires. He rubbed one of them\nhard across the ruby he still carried and there was a gritting sound as\nit cut a deep scratch in the ruby.\n\n\"I'll be damned,\" he said aloud.\n\nThere was only one stone hard enough to cut a ruby--the diamond.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was almost dark when he returned to where Barber was resting beside\ntheir packs.\n\n\"What did you find to keep you out so late?\" Barber asked curiously.\n\nHe dropped a double handful of rubies, sapphires and diamonds at\nBarber's feet.\n\n\"Take a look,\" he said. \"On a civilized world what you see there would\nbuy us a ship without our having to lift a finger. Here they're just\npretty rocks.\n\n\"Except the diamonds,\" he added \"At least we now have something to cut\nthose quartz crystals with.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey took only a few of the rubies and sapphires the next morning but\nthey gathered more of the diamonds, looking in particular for the\ngray-black and ugly but very hard and tough carbonado variety. Then they\nresumed their circling of the chasm's walls.\n\nThe heat continued its steady increase as the days went by. Only at\nnight was there any relief from it and the nights were growing swiftly\nshorter as the blue sun rose earlier each morning. When the yellow sun\nrose the chasm became a blazing furnace around the edge of which they\ncrept like ants in some gigantic oven.\n\nThere was no life in any form to be seen; no animal or bush or blade of\ngrass. There was only the barren floor of the chasm, made a harsh green\nshade by the two suns and writhing and undulating with heat waves like a\nnightmare sea, while above them the towering cliffs shimmered, too, and\nsometimes seemed to be leaning far out over their heads and already\nfalling down upon them.\n\nThey found no more minerals of any kind and they came at last to the\nplace where they had seen the smoke or vapor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere the walls of the chasm drew back to form a little valley a mile\nlong by half a mile wide. The walls did not drop vertically to the floor\nthere but sloped out at the base into a fantastic formation of natural\nroofs and arches that reached almost to the center of the valley from\neach side. Green things grew in the shade under the arches and sparkling\nwaterfalls cascaded down over many of them. A small creek carried the\nwater out of the valley, going out into the chasm a little way before\nthe hot sands absorbed it.\n\nThey stood and watched for some time, but there was no movement in the\nvalley other than the waving of the green plants as a breeze stirred\nthem. Once the breeze shifted to bring them the fresh, sweet scent of\ngrowing things and urge them to come closer.\n\n\"A place like that doesn't belong here,\" Barber said in a low voice.\n\"But it's there. I wonder what else is there?\"\n\n\"Shade and cool water,\" Humbolt said. \"And maybe things that don't like\nstrangers. Let's go find out.\"\n\nThey watched warily as they walked, their crossbows in their hands. At\nthe closer range they saw that the roofs and arches were the outer\nremains of a system of natural caves that went back into the valley's\nwalls. The green vegetation grew wherever the roofs gave part-time\nshade, consisting mainly of a holly-leafed bush with purple flowers and\na tall plant resembling corn.\n\nUnder some of the roofs the corn was mature, the orange colored grains\nvisible. Under others it was no more than half grown. He saw the reason\nand said to Barber:\n\n\"There are both warm and cold springs here. The plants watered by the\nwarm springs would grow almost the year around; the ones watered by the\ncold springs only in the summer. And what we saw from the mountain top\nwould have been vapor rising from the warm springs.\"\n\nThey passed under arch after arch without seeing any life. When they\ncame to the valley's upper end and still had seen nothing it seemed\nevident that there was little danger of an encounter with any\nintelligent-and-hostile creatures. Apparently nothing at all lived in\nthe little valley.\n\nHumbolt stopped under a broad arch where the breeze was made cool and\nmoist by the spray of water it had come through. Barber went on, to look\nunder the adjoining arch.\n\nCaves led into the wall from both arches and as he stood there Humbolt\nsaw something lying in the mouth of the nearest cave. It was a little\nmound of orange corn; lying in a neat pile as though whatever had left\nit there had intended to come back after it.\n\nHe looked toward the other arch but Barber was somewhere out of sight.\nHe doubted that whatever had left the corn could be much of a\nmenace--dangerous animals were more apt to eat flesh than corn--but he\nwent to the cave with his crossbow ready.\n\nHe stopped at the mouth of the cave to let his eyes become accustomed to\nthe darkness inside it. As he did so the things inside came out to meet\nhim.\n\nThey emerged into full view; six little animals the size of squirrels,\neach of them a different color. They walked on short hind legs like\nminiature bears and the dark eyes in the bear-chipmunk faces were fixed\non him with intense interest. They stopped five feet in front of him,\nthere to stand in a neat row and continue the fascinated staring up at\nhim.\n\nThe yellow one in the center scratched absently at its stomach with a\nfurry paw and he lowered the bow, feeling a little foolish at having\nbothered to raise it against animals so small and harmless.\n\nThen he half brought it up again as the yellow one opened its mouth and\nsaid in a tone that held distinct anticipation:\n\n\"I think we'll eat you for supper.\"\n\nHe darted glances to right and left but there was nothing near him\nexcept the six little animals. The yellow one, having spoken, was\nstaring silently at him with only curiosity on its furry face. He\nwondered if some miasma or some scent from the vegetation in the valley\nhad warped his mind into sudden insanity and asked:\n\n\"You think you'll do what?\"\n\nIt opened its mouth again, to stutter, \"I--I----\" Then, with a note of\nalarm, _\"Hey....\"_\n\nIt said no more and the next sound was that of Barber hurrying toward\nhim and calling, \"Hey--Bill--where are you?\"\n\n\"Here,\" he answered, and he was already sure that he knew why the little\nanimal had spoken to him.\n\nBarber came up and saw the six chipmunk-bears. \"Six of them!\" he\nexclaimed. \"There's one in the next cave--the damned thing spoke to me!\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" he replied. \"You told it we'd have it for supper and\nthen it said, 'You think you'll do what?' didn't it?\"\n\nBarber's face showed surprise. \"How did you know that?\"\n\n\"They're telepathic between one another,\" he said. \"The yellow one there\nrepeated what the one you spoke to heard you say and it repeated what\nthe yellow one heard me say. It has to be telepathy between them.\"\n\n\"Telepathy----\" Barber stared at the six little animals, who stared back\nwith their fascinated curiosity undiminished. \"But why should they want\nto repeat aloud what they receive telepathically?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Maybe at some stage in their evolution only part of them\nwere telepaths and the telepaths broadcasted danger warnings to the\nothers that way. So far as that goes, why does a parrot repeat what it\nhears?\"\n\nThere was a scurry of movement behind Barber and another of the little\nanimals, a white one, hurried past them. It went to the yellow one and\nthey stood close together as they stared up. Apparently they were\nmates....\n\n\"That's the other one--those are the two that mocked us,\" Barber said,\nand thereby gave them the name by which they would be known: mockers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe mockers were fresh meat--but they accepted the humans with such\nfriendliness and trust that Barber lost all his desire to have one for\nsupper or for any other time. They had a limited supply of dried meat\nand there would be plenty of orange corn. They would not go hungry.\n\nThey discovered that the mockers had living quarters in both the cool\ncaves and the ones warmed by the hot springs. There was evidence that\nthey hibernated during the winters in the warm caves.\n\nThere were no minerals in the mockers' valley and they set out to\ncontinue their circuit of the chasm. They did not get far until the heat\nhad become so great that the chasm's tributaries began going dry. They\nturned back then, to wait in the little valley until the fall rains\ncame.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the long summer was ended by the first rain they resumed their\njourney. They took a supply of the orange corn and two of the mockers;\nthe yellow one and its mate. The other mockers watched them leave,\nstanding silent and solemn in front of their caves as though they feared\nthey might never see their two fellows or the humans again.\n\nThe two mockers were pleasant company, riding on their shoulders and\nchattering any nonsense that came to mind. And sometimes saying things\nthat were not at all nonsense, making Humbolt wonder if mockers could\npartly read human minds and dimly understand the meaning of some of the\nthings they said.\n\nThey found a place where saltpeter was very thinly and erratically\ndistributed. They scraped off all the films of it that were visible and\nprocured a small amount. They completed their circuit and reached the\nfoot of the long, steep slope of the Craigs without finding anything\nmore.\n\nIt was an awesome climb that lay before them; up a grade so steep and\nbarred with so many low ledges that when their legs refused to carry\nthem farther they crawled. The heat was still very serious and there\nwould be no water until they came to the spring beyond the mountain's\nsummit. A burning wind, born on the blazing floor of the chasm, followed\nthem up the mountain all day. Their leather canteens were almost dry\nwhen night came and they were no more than a third of the way to the\ntop.\n\nThe mockers had become silent as the elevation increased and when they\nstopped for the night Humbolt saw that they would never live to cross\nthe mountain. They were breathing fast, their hearts racing, as they\ntried to extract enough oxygen from the thin air. They drank a few drops\nof water but they would not touch the corn he offered them.\n\nThe white mocker died at midmorning the next day as they stopped for a\nrest. The yellow one crawled feebly to her side and died a few minutes\nlater.\n\n\"So that's that,\" Humbolt said, looking down at them. \"The only things\non Ragnarok that ever trusted us and wanted to be our friends--and we\nkilled them.\"\n\nThey drank the last of their water and went on. They made dry camp that\nnight and dreams of cold streams of water tormented their exhausted\nsleep. The next day was a hellish eternity in which they walked and fell\nand crawled and walked and fell again.\n\nBarber weakened steadily, his breathing growing to a rattling panting.\nHe spoke once that afternoon, to try to smile with dry, swollen lips and\nsay between his panting gasps, \"It would be hell--to have to die--so\nthirsty like this.\"\n\nAfter that he fell with increasing frequency, each time slower and\nweaker in getting up again. Half a mile short of the summit he fell for\nthe last time. He tried to get up, failed, and tried to crawl. He failed\nat that, too, and collapsed face down in the rocky soil.\n\nHumbolt went to him and said between his own labored intakes of breath,\n\"Wait, Dan--I'll go on--bring you back water.\"\n\nBarber raised himself with a great effort and looked up. \"No use,\" he\nsaid. \"My heart--too much----\"\n\nHe fell forward again and that time he was very still, his desperate\npanting no more.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed to Humbolt that it was half a lifetime later that he finally\nreached the spring and the cold, clear water. He drank, the most\necstatic pleasure he had ever experienced in his life. Then the pleasure\ndrained away as he seemed to see Dan Barber trying to smile and seemed\nto hear him say, \"It would be hell--to have to die--so thirsty like\nthis.\"\n\nHe rested for two days before he was in condition to continue on his\nway. He reached the plateau and saw that the woods goats had been\nmigrating south for some time. On the second morning he climbed up a\ngentle roll in the plain and met three unicorns face to face.\n\nThey charged at once, squealing with anticipation. Had he been equipped\nwith an ordinary bow he would have been killed within seconds. But the\nautomatic crossbow poured a rain of arrows into the faces of the\nunicorns that caused them to swing aside in pain and enraged\nastonishment. The moment they had swung enough to expose the area just\nbehind their heads the arrows became fatal.\n\nOne unicorn escaped, three arrows bristling in its face. It watched him\nfrom a distance for a little while, squealing and shaking its head in\nbaffled fury. Then it turned and disappeared over a swell in the plain,\nrunning like a deer.\n\nHe resumed his southward march, hurrying faster than before. The unicorn\nhad headed north and that could be for but one purpose: to bring enough\nreinforcements to finish the job.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe reached the caves at night. No one was up but George Ord, working\nlate in his combination workshop-laboratory.\n\nGeorge looked up at the sound of his entrance and saw that he was alone.\n\"So Dan didn't make it?\" he asked.\n\n\"The chasm got him,\" he answered. And then, wearily, \"The chasm--we\nfound the damned thing.\"\n\n\"The red stratum----\"\n\n\"It was only iron stains.\"\n\n\"I made a little pilot smelter while you were gone,\" George said. \"I was\nhoping the red stratum would be ore. The other prospecting parties--none\nof them found anything.\"\n\n\"We'll try again next spring,\" he said. \"We'll find it somewhere, no\nmatter how long it takes.\"\n\n\"Our time may not be so long. The observations show the sun to be\nfarther south than ever.\"\n\n\"Then we'll make double use of the time we do have. We'll cut the\nhunting parties to the limit and send out more prospecting parties.\nWe're going to have a ship to meet the Gerns again.\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" George said, his black eyes studying him thoughtfully, \"I\nthink that's all you live for, Bill: for the day when you can kill\nGerns.\"\n\nGeorge said it as a statement of a fact, without censure, but Humbolt\ncould not keep an edge of harshness out of his voice as he answered:\n\n\"For as long as I'm leader that's all we're all going to live for.\"\n\nHe followed the game south that fall, taking with him Bob Craig and\nyoung Anders. Hundreds of miles south of the caves they came to the\nlowlands; a land of much water and vegetation and vast herds of unicorns\nand woods goats. It was an exceedingly dangerous country, due to the\nconcentration of unicorns and prowlers, and only the automatic crossbows\ncombined with never ceasing vigilance enabled them to survive.\n\nThere they saw the crawlers; hideous things that crawled on multiple\nlegs like three-ton centipedes, their mouths set with six mandibles and\ndripping a stinking saliva. The bite of a crawler was poisonous,\ninstantly paralyzing even to a unicorn, though not instantly killing\nthem. The crawlers ate their victims at once, however, ripping the\nhelpless and still living flesh from its bones.\n\nAlthough the unicorns feared the crawlers, the prowlers hated them with\na fanatical intensity and made use of their superior quickness to kill\nevery crawler they found; ripping at the crawler until the crawler, in\nan insanity of rage, bit itself and died of its own poison.\n\nThey had taken one of the powerful longbows with them, in addition to\ntheir crossbows, and they killed a crawler with it one day. As they did\nso a band of twenty prowlers came suddenly upon them.\n\nTwenty prowlers, with the advantage of surprise at short range, could\nhave slaughtered them. Instead, the prowlers continued on their way\nwithout as much as a challenging snarl.\n\n\"Now why,\" Bob Craig wondered, \"did they do that?\"\n\n\"They saw we had just killed a crawler,\" Humbolt said. \"The crawlers are\ntheir enemies and I guess letting us live was their way of showing\nappreciation.\"\n\nTheir further explorations of the lowlands revealed no minerals--nothing\nbut alluvial material of unknown depth--and there was no reason to stay\nlonger except that return to the caves was impossible until spring came.\nThey built attack-proof shelters in the trees and settled down to wait\nout the winter.\n\nThey started north with the first wave of woods goats, nothing but lack\nof success to show for their months of time and effort.\n\nWhen they were almost to the caves they came to the barren valley where\nthe Gerns had herded the Rejects out of the cruisers and to the place\nwhere the stockade had been. It was a lonely place, the stockade walls\nfallen and scattered and the graves of Humbolt's mother and all the\nothers long since obliterated by the hooves of the unicorn legions.\nBitter memories were reawakened, tinged by the years with nostalgia,\nand the stockade was far behind them before the dark mood left him.\n\nThe orange corn was planted that spring and the number of prospecting\nparties was doubled.\n\nThe corn sprouted, grew feebly, and died before maturity. The\nprospecting parties returned one by one, each to report no success. He\ndecided, that fall, that time was too precious to waste--they would have\nto use the alternate plan he had spoken of.\n\nHe went to George Ord and asked him if it would be possible to build a\nhyperspace transmitter with the materials they had.\n\n\"It's the one way we could have a chance to leave here without a ship of\nour own,\" he said. \"By luring a Gern cruiser here and then taking it\naway from them.\"\n\nGeorge shook his head. \"A hyperspace transmitter _might_ be built, given\nenough years of time. But it would be useless without power. It would\ntake a generator of such size that we'd have to melt down every gun,\nknife, axe, every piece of steel and iron we have. And then we'd be five\nhundred pounds short. On top of that, we'd have to have at least three\nhundred pounds more of copper for additional wire.\"\n\n\"I didn't realize it would take such a large generator,\" he said after a\nsilence. \"I was sure we could have a transmitter.\"\n\n\"Get me the metal and we can,\" George said. He sighed restlessly and\nthere was almost hatred in his eyes as he looked at the inclosing walls\nof the cave. \"You're not the only one who would like to leave our\nprison. Get me eight hundred pounds of copper and iron and I'll make the\ntransmitter, some way.\"\n\nEight hundred pounds of metal.... On Ragnarok that was like asking for\nthe sun.\n\nThe years went by and each year there was the same determined effort,\nthe same lack of success. And each year the suns were farther south,\nmarking the coming of the end of any efforts other than the one to\nsurvive.\n\nIn the year thirty, when fall came earlier than ever before, he was\nforced to admit to himself the bleak and bitter fact: he and the others\nwere not of the generation that would escape from Ragnarok. They were\nEarth-born--they were not adapted to Ragnarok and could not scour a\nworld of 1.5 gravity for metals that might not exist.\n\nAnd vengeance was a luxury he could not have.\n\nA question grew in his mind where there had been only his hatred for the\nGerns before. _What would become of the future generations on Ragnarok?_\n\nWith the question a scene from his childhood kept coming back to him; a\nlate summer evening in the first year on Ragnarok and Julia sitting\nbeside him in the warm starlight....\n\n\"You're my son, Billy,\" she had said. \"The first I ever had. Now, before\nso very long, maybe I'll have another one.\"\n\nHesitantly, not wanting to believe, he had asked, \"What some of them\nsaid about how you might die then--it won't really happen, will it,\nJulia?\"\n\n\"It ... might.\" Then her arm had gone around him and she had said, \"If I\ndo I'll leave in my place a life that's more important than mine ever\nwas.\n\n\"Remember me, Billy, and this evening, and what I said to you, if you\nshould ever be leader. Remember that it's only through the children that\nwe can ever survive and whip this world. Protect them while they're\nsmall and helpless and teach them to fight and be afraid of nothing when\nthey're a little older. Never, never let them forget how they came to be\non Ragnarok. Someday, even if it's a hundred years from now, the Gerns\nwill come again and they must be ready to fight, for their freedom and\nfor their lives.\"\n\nHe had been too young then to understand how truly she had spoken and\nwhen he was old enough his hatred for the Gerns had blinded him to\neverything but his own desires. Now, he could see....\n\nThe children of each generation would be better adapted to Ragnarok and\nfull adaptation would eventually come. But all the generations of the\nfuture would be potential slaves of the Gern Empire, free only so long\nas they remained unnoticed.\n\nIt was inconceivable that the Gerns should never pass by Ragnarok\nthrough all time to come. And when they finally came the slow,\nuneventful progression of decades and centuries might have brought a\nfalse sense of security to the people of Ragnarok, might have turned the\nstories of what the Gerns did to the Rejects into legends and then into\nmyths that no one any longer believed.\n\nThe Gerns would have to be brought to Ragnarok before that could happen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe went to George Ord again and said:\n\n\"There's one kind of transmitter we could make a generator for--a plain\nnormal-space transmitter, dot-dash, without a receiver.\"\n\nGeorge laid down the diamond cutting wheel he had been working on.\n\n\"It would take two hundred years for the signal to get to Athena at the\nspeed of light,\" he said. \"Then, forty days after it got there, a Gern\ncruiser would come hell-bent to investigate.\"\n\n\"I want the ones of the future to know that the Gerns will be here no\nlater than two hundred years from now. And with always the chance that a\nGern cruiser in space might pick up the signal at any time before then.\"\n\n\"I see,\" George said. \"The sword of Damocles hanging over their heads,\nto make them remember.\"\n\n\"You know what would happen to them if they ever forgot. You're as old\nas I am--you know what the Gerns did to us.\"\n\n\"I'm older than you are,\" George said. \"I was nine when the Gerns left\nus here. They kept my father and mother and my sister was only three. I\ntried to keep her warm by holding her but the Hell Fever got her that\nfirst night. She was too young to understand why I couldn't help her\nmore....\"\n\nHatred burned in his eyes at the memory, like some fire that had been\nbanked but had never died. \"Yes, I remember the Gerns and what they did.\nI wouldn't want it to have to happen to others--the transmitter will be\nmade so that it won't.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe guns were melted down, together with other items of iron and steel,\nto make the castings for the generator. Ceramic pipes were made to carry\nwater from the spring to a waterwheel. The long, slow job of converting\nthe miscellany of electronic devices, many of them broken, into the\ncomponents of a transmitter proceeded.\n\nIt was five years before the transmitter was ready for testing. It was\nearly fall of the year thirty-five then, and the water that gushed from\nthe pipe splashed in cold drops against Humbolt as the waterwheel was\nset in motion.\n\nThe generator began to hum and George observed the output of it and the\ntransmitter as registered by the various meters he had made.\n\n\"Weak, but it will reach the Gern monitor station on Athena,\" he said,\n\"It's ready to send--what do you want to say?\"\n\n\"Make it something short,\" he said. \"Make it, _'Ragnarok calling.'_\"\n\nGeorge poised his finger over the transmitting key. \"This will set\nforces in motion that can never be recalled. What we do here this\nmorning is going to cause a lot of Gerns--or Ragnarok people--to die.\"\n\n\"It will be the Gerns who die,\" he said. \"Send the signal.\"\n\n\"Like you, I believe the same thing,\" George said. \"I have to believe it\nbecause that's the way I want it to be. I hope we're right. It's\nsomething we'll never know.\"\n\nHe began depressing the key.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA boy was given the job of operating the key and the signal went out\ndaily until the freezing of winter stopped the waterwheel that powered\nthe generator.\n\nThe sending of the signals was resumed when spring came and the\nprospecting parties continued their vain search for metals.\n\nThe suns continued moving south and each year the springs came later,\nthe falls earlier. In the spring of forty-five he saw that he would have\nto make his final decision.\n\nBy then they had dwindled until they numbered only sixty-eight; the\nYoung Ones gray and rapidly growing old. There was no longer any use to\ncontinue the prospecting--if any metals were to be found they were at\nthe north end of the plateau where the snow no longer melted during the\nsummer. They were too few to do more than prepare for what the Old Ones\nhad feared they might have to face--Big Winter. That would require the\nwork of all of them.\n\nSheets of mica were brought down from the Craigs, the summits of which\nwere deeply buried under snow even in midsummer. Stoves were made of\nfireclay and mica, which would give both heat and light and would be\nmore efficient than the open fireplaces. The innermost caves were\nprepared for occupation, with multiple doors to hold out the cold and\nwith laboriously excavated ventilation ducts and smoke outlets.\n\nThere were sixty of them in the fall of fifty, when all had been done\nthat could be done to prepare for what might come.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"There aren't many of the Earth-born left now,\" Bob Craig said to him\none night as they sat in the flickering light of a stove. \"And there\nhasn't been time for there to be many of the Ragnarok-born. The Gerns\nwouldn't get many slaves if they should come now.\"\n\n\"They could use however many they found,\" he answered. \"The younger\nones, who are the best adapted to this gravity, would be exceptionally\nstrong and quick on a one-gravity world. There are dangerous jobs where\na strong, quick slave is a lot more efficient and expendable than\ncomplex, expensive machines.\"\n\n\"And they would want some specimens for scientific study,\" Jim Lake\nsaid. \"They would want to cut into the young ones and see how they're\nbuilt that they're adapted to this one and a half gravity world.\"\n\nHe smiled with the cold mirthlessness that always reminded Humbolt of\nhis father--of the Lake who had been the _Constellation_'s lieutenant\ncommander. \"According to the books the Gerns never did try to make it a\nsecret that when a Gern doctor or biologist cuts into the muscles or\norgans of a non-Gern to see what makes them tick, he wants them to be\nstill alive and ticking as he does so.\"\n\nSeventeen-year-old Don Chiara spoke, to say slowly, thoughtfully:\n\n\"Slavery and vivisection.... If the Gerns should come now when there are\nso few of us, and if we should fight the best we could and lose, it\nwould be better for whoever was the last of us left to put a knife in\nthe hearts of the women and children than to let the Gerns have them.\"\n\nNo one made any answer. There was no answer to make, no alternative to\nsuggest.\n\n\"In the future there will be more of us and it will be different,\" he\nsaid at last. \"On Earth the Gerns were always stronger and faster than\nhumans but when the Gerns come to Ragnarok they're going to find a race\nthat isn't really human any more. They're going to find a race before\nwhich they'll be like woods goats before prowlers.\"\n\n\"If only they don't come too soon,\" Craig said.\n\n\"That was the chance that had to be taken,\" he replied.\n\nHe wondered again as he spoke, as he had wondered so often in the past\nyears, if he had given them all their death sentence when he ordered the\ntransmitter built. Yet, the future generations could not be permitted to\nforget ... and steel could not be tempered without first thrusting it\ninto the fire.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was the last of the Young Ones when he awoke one night in the fall of\nfifty-six and found himself burning with the Hell Fever. He did not\nsummon any of the others. They could do nothing for him and he had\nalready done all he could for them.\n\nHe had done all he could for them ... and now he would leave forty-nine\nmen, women and children to face the unknown forces of Big Winter while\nover them hung the sword he had forged; the increasing danger of\ndetection by the Gerns.\n\nThe question came again, sharp with the knowledge that it was far too\nlate for him to change any of it. _Did I arrange the execution of my\npeople?_\n\nThen, through the red haze of the fever, Julia spoke to him out of the\npast; sitting again beside him in the summer twilight and saying:\n\n_Remember me, Billy, and this evening, and what I said to you ... teach\nthem to fight and be afraid of nothing ... never let them forget how\nthey came to be on Ragnarok...._\n\nShe seemed very near and real and the doubt faded and was gone. _Teach\nthem to fight ... never let them forget...._ The men of Ragnarok were\nonly fur-clad hunters who crouched in caves but they would grow in\nnumbers as time went by. Each generation would be stronger than the\ngeneration before it and he had set forces in motion that would bring\nthe last generation the trial of combat and the opportunity for freedom.\nHow well they fought on that day would determine their destiny but he\nwas certain, once again, what that destiny would be.\n\nIt would be to walk as conquerors before beaten and humbled Gerns.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was winter of the year eighty-five and the temperature was one\nhundred and six degrees below zero. Walter Humbolt stood in front of the\nice tunnel that led back through the glacier to the caves and looked up\ninto the sky.\n\nIt was noon but there was no sun in the starlit sky. Many weeks before\nthe sun had slipped below the southern horizon. For a little while a dim\nhalo had marked its passage each day; then that, too, had faded away.\nBut now it was time for the halo to appear again, to herald the sun's\nreturning.\n\nFrost filled the sky, making the stars flicker as it swirled endlessly\ndownward. He blinked against it, his eyelashes trying to freeze to his\nlower eyelids at the movement, and turned to look at the north.\n\nThere the northern lights were a gigantic curtain that filled a third of\nthe sky, rippling and waving in folds that pulsated in red and green,\nrose and lavender and violet. Their reflection gleamed on the glacier\nthat sloped down from the caves and glowed softly on the other glacier;\nthe one that covered the transmitter station. The transmitter had long\nago been taken into the caves but the generator and waterwheel were\nstill there, frozen in a tomb of ice.\n\nFor three years the glacier had been growing before the caves and the\nplateau's southern face had been buried under snow for ten years. Only a\nfew woods goats ever came as far north as the country south of the caves\nand they stayed only during the brief period between the last snow of\nspring and the first snow of fall. Their winter home was somewhere down\nnear the equator. What had been called the Southern Lowlands was a\nfrozen, lifeless waste.\n\nOnce they had thought about going to the valley in the chasm where the\nmockers would be hibernating in their warm caves. But even if they could\nhave gone up the plateau and performed the incredible feat of crossing\nthe glacier-covered, blizzard-ripped Craigs, they would have found no\nfood in the mockers' valley--only a little corn the mockers had stored\naway, which would soon have been exhausted.\n\nThere was no place for them to live but in the caves or as nomads\nmigrating with the animals. And if they migrated to the equator each\nyear they would have to leave behind them all the books and tools and\neverything that might someday have given them a civilized way of life\nand might someday have shown them how to escape from their prison.\n\nHe looked again to the south where the halo should be, thinking: _They\nshould have made their decision in there by now. I'm their leader--but I\ncan't force them to stay here against their will. I could only ask them\nto consider what it would mean if we left here._\n\nSnow creaked underfoot as he moved restlessly. He saw something lying\nunder the blanket of frost and went to it. It was an arrow that someone\nhad dropped. He picked it up, carefully, because the intense cold had\nmade the shaft as brittle as glass. It would regain its normal strength\nwhen taken into the caves----\n\nThere was the sound of steps and Fred Schroeder came out of the tunnel,\ndressed as he was dressed in bulky furs. Schroeder looked to the south\nand said, \"It seems to be starting to get a little lighter there.\"\n\nHe saw that it was; a small, faint paling of the black sky.\n\n\"They talked over what you and I told them,\" Schroeder said. \"And about\nhow we've struggled to stay here this long and how, even if the sun\nshould stop drifting south this year, it will be years of ice and cold\nat the caves before Big Spring comes.\"\n\n\"If we leave here the glacier will cover the caves and fill them with\nice,\" he said. \"All we ever had will be buried back in there and all\nwe'll have left will be our bows and arrows and animal skins. We'll be\ntaking a one-way road back into the stone age, for ourselves and our\nchildren and their children.\"\n\n\"They know that,\" Schroeder said. \"We both told them.\"\n\nHe paused. They watched the sky to the south turn lighter. The northern\nlights flamed unnoticed behind them as the pale halo of the invisible\nsun slowly brightened to its maximum. Their faces were white with\nnear-freezing then and they turned to go back into the caves. \"They had\nmade their decision,\" Schroeder went on. \"I guess you and I did them an\ninjustice when we thought they had lost their determination, when we\nthought they might want to hand their children a flint axe and say,\n'Here--take this and let it be the symbol of all you are or all you will\never be.'\n\n\"Their decision was unanimous--we'll stay for as long as it's possible\nfor us to survive here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHoward Lake listened to Teacher Morgan West read from the diary of\nWalter Humbolt, written during the terrible winter of thirty-five years\nbefore:\n\n_\"Each morning the light to the south was brighter. On the seventh\nmorning we saw the sun--and it was not due until the eighth morning!\n\n\"It will be years before we can stop fighting the enclosure of the\nglacier but we have reached and passed the dead of Big Winter. We have\nreached the bottom and the only direction we can go in the future is\nup._\n\n\"And so,\" West said, closing the book, \"we are here in the caves tonight\nbecause of the stubbornness of Humbolt and Schroeder and all the others.\nHad they thought only of their own welfare, had they conceded defeat and\ngone into the migratory way of life, we would be sitting beside grass\ncampfires somewhere to the south tonight, our way of life containing no\nplans or aspirations greater than to follow the game back and forth\nthrough the years.\n\n\"Now, let's go outside to finish tonight's lesson.\"\n\nTeacher West led the way into the starlit night just outside the caves,\nHoward Lake and the other children following him. West pointed to the\nsky where the star group they called the Athena Constellation blazed\nlike a huge arrowhead high in the east.\n\n\"There,\" he said, \"beyond the top of the arrowhead, is where we were\ngoing when the Gerns stopped us a hundred and twenty years ago and left\nus to die on Ragnarok. It's so far that Athena's sun can't be seen from\nhere, so far that it will be another hundred and fifteen years before\nour first signal gets there. Why is it, then, that you and all the other\ngroups of children have to learn such things as history, physics, the\nGern language, and the way to fire a Gern blaster?\"\n\nThe hand of every child went up. West selected eight-year-old Clifton\nHumbolt. \"Tell us, Clifton,\" he said.\n\n\"Because,\" Clifton answered, \"a Gern cruiser might pass by a few\nlight-years out at any time and pick up our signals. So we have to know\nall we can about them and how to fight them because there aren't very\nmany of us yet.\"\n\n\"The Gerns will come to kill us,\" little Marie Chiara said, her dark\neyes large and earnest. \"They'll come to kill us and to make slaves out\nof the ones they don't kill, like they did with the others a long time\nago. They're awful mean and awful smart and we have to be smarter than\nthey are.\"\n\nHoward looked again at the Athena constellation, thinking, _I hope they\ncome just as soon as I'm old enough to fight them, or even tonight...._\n\n\"Teacher,\" he asked, \"how would a Gern cruiser look if it came tonight?\nWould it come from the Athena arrowhead?\"\n\n\"It probably would,\" West answered. \"You would see its rocket blast,\nlike a bright trail of fire----\"\n\nA bright trail of fire burst suddenly into being, coming from the\nconstellation of Athena and lighting up the woods and hills and their\nstartled faces as it arced down toward them.\n\n_\"It's them!\"_ a treble voice exclaimed and there was a quick flurry of\nmovement as Howard and the other older children shoved the younger\nchildren behind them.\n\nThen the light vanished, leaving a dimming glow where it had been.\n\n\"Only a meteor,\" West said. He looked at the line of older children who\nwere standing protectingly in front of the younger ones, rocks in their\nhands with which to ward off the Gerns, and he smiled in the way he had\nwhen he was pleased with them.\n\nHoward watched the meteor trail fade swiftly into invisibility and felt\nhis heartbeats slow from the first wild thrill to gray disappointment.\nOnly a meteor....\n\nBut someday he might be leader and by then, surely, the Gerns would\ncome. If not, he would find some way to make them come.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTen years later Howard Lake was leader. There were three hundred and\nfifty of them then and Big Spring was on its way to becoming Big Summer.\nThe snow was gone from the southern end of the plateau and once again\ngame migrated up the valleys east of the caves.\n\nThere were many things to be done now that Big Winter was past and they\ncould have the chance to do them. They needed a larger pottery kiln, a\nlarger workshop with a wooden lathe, more diamonds to make cutting\nwheels, more quartz crystals to make binoculars and microscopes. They\ncould again explore the field of inorganic chemistry, even though\nresults in the past had produced nothing of value, and they could,\nwithin a few years, resume the metal prospecting up the plateau--the\nmost important project of all.\n\nTheir weapons seemed to be as perfect as was possible but when the\nGerns came they would need some quick and certain means of communication\nbetween the various units that would fight the Gerns. A leader who could\nnot communicate with his forces and coordinate their actions would be\nhelpless. And they had on Ragnarok a form of communication, if trained,\nthat the Gerns could not detect or interfere with electronically: the\nmockers.\n\nThe Craigs were still white and impassable with snow that summer but the\nsnow was receding higher each year. Five years later, in the summer of\none hundred and thirty-five, the Craigs were passable for a few weeks.\n\nLake led a party of eight over them and down into the chasm. They took\nwith them two small cages, constructed of wood and glass and made\nairtight with the strong medusabush glue. Each cage was equipped with a\nsimple air pump and a pressure gauge.\n\nThey brought back two pairs of mockers as interested and trusting\ncaptives, together with a supply of the orange corn and a large amount\nof diamonds. The mockers, in their pressure-maintained cages, were not\neven aware of the increase in elevation as they were carried over the\nhigh summit of the Craigs.\n\nTo Lake and the men with him the climb back up the long, steep slope of\nthe mountain was a stiff climb to make in one day but no more than that.\nIt was hard to believe that it had taken Humbolt and Barber almost three\ndays to climb it and that Barber had died in the attempt. It reminded\nhim of the old crossbows that Humbolt and the others had used. They were\nthin, with a light pull, such as the present generation boys used. It\nmust have required courage for the old ones to dare unicorn attacks with\nbows so thin that only the small area behind the unicorn's jaws was\nvulnerable to their arrows....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the caves were reached, a very gradual reduction of pressure in the\nmocker cages was started; one that would cover a period of weeks. One\npair of mockers survived and had two young ones that fall. The young\nmockers, like the first generation of Ragnarok-born children of many\nyears before, were more adapted to their environment than their parents\nwere.\n\nThe orange corn was planted, using an adaptation method somewhat similar\nto that used with the mockers. It might have worked had the orange corn\nnot required such a long period of time in which to reach maturity. When\nwinter came only a few grains had formed.\n\nThey were saved for next year's seeds, to continue the slow adaptation\nprocess.\n\nBy the fifth year the youngest generation of mockers was well adapted to\nthe elevation of the caves but for a susceptibility to a quickly fatal\nform of pneumonia which made it necessary to keep them from exposing\nthemselves to the cold or to any sudden changes of temperature.\n\nTheir intelligence was surprising and they seemed to be partially\nreceptive to human thoughts, as Bill Humbolt had written. By the end of\nthe fifteenth year their training had reached such a stage of perfection\nthat a mocker would transmit or not transmit with only the unspoken\nthought of its master to tell it which it should be. In addition, they\nwould transmit the message to whichever mocker their master's thought\ndirected. Presumably all mockers received the message but only the\nmocker to whom it was addressed would repeat it aloud.\n\nThey had their method of communication. They had their automatic\ncrossbows for quick, close fighting, and their long range longbows. They\nwere fully adapted to the 1.5 gravity and their reflexes were almost\nlike those of prowlers--Ragnarok had long ago separated the quick from\nthe dead.\n\nThere were eight hundred and nineteen of them that year, in the early\nspring of one hundred and fifty, and they were ready and impatient for\nthe coming of the Gerns.\n\nThen the transmitter, which had been in operation again for many years,\nfailed one day.\n\nGeorge Craig had finished checking it when Lake arrived. He looked up\nfrom his instruments, remarkably similar in appearance to a sketch of\nthe old George Ord--a resemblance that had been passed down to him by\nhis mother--and said:\n\n\"The entire circuit is either gone or ready to go. It's already operated\nfor a lot longer than it should have.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" Lake said. \"It's served its purpose. We won't\nrebuild it.\"\n\nGeorge watched him questioningly.\n\n\"It's served its purpose,\" he said again. \"It didn't let us forget that\nthe Gerns will come again. But that isn't enough, now. The first signal\nwon't reach Athena until the year two thirty-five. It will be the dead\nof Big Winter again then. They'll have to fight the Gerns with bows and\narrows that the cold will make as brittle as glass. They won't have a\nchance.\"\n\n\"No,\" George said. \"They won't have a chance. But what can we do to\nchange it?\"\n\n\"It's something I've been thinking about,\" he said. \"We'll build a\nhyperspace transmitter and bring the Gerns before Big Winter comes.\"\n\n\"We will?\" George asked, lifting his dark eyebrows. \"And what do we use\nfor the three hundred pounds of copper and five hundred pounds of iron\nwe would have to have to make the generator?\"\n\n\"Surely we can find five hundred pounds of iron somewhere on Ragnarok.\nThe north end of the plateau might be the best bet. As for the copper--I\ndoubt that we'll ever find it. But there are seams of a bauxite-like\nclay in the Western hills--they're certain to contain aluminum to at\nleast some extent. So we'll make the wires of aluminum.\"\n\n\"The ore would have to be refined to pure aluminum oxide before it could\nbe smelted,\" George said. \"And you can't smelt aluminum ore in an\nordinary furnace--only in an electric furnace with a generator that can\nsupply a high amperage. And we would have to have cryolite ore to serve\nas the solvent in the smelting process.\"\n\n\"There's a seam of cryolite in the Eastern Hills, according to the old\nmaps,\" said Lake. \"We could make a larger generator by melting down\neverything we have. It wouldn't be big enough to power the hyperspace\ntransmitter but it should be big enough to smelt aluminum ore.\"\n\nGeorge considered the idea. \"I think we can do it.\"\n\n\"How long until we can send the signal?\" he asked.\n\n\"Given the extra metal we need, the building of the generator is a\nsimple job. The transmitter is what will take years--maybe as long as\nfifty.\"\n\n_Fifty years...._\n\n\"Can't anything be done to make it sooner?\" he asked.\n\n\"I know,\" George said. \"You would like for the Gerns to come while\nyou're still here. So would every man on Ragnarok. But even on Earth the\nbuilding of a hyperspace transmitter was a long, slow job, with all the\nmaterials they needed and all the special tools and equipment. Here\nwe'll have to do everything by hand and for materials we have only\nbroken and burned-out odds and ends. It will take about fifty years--it\ncan't be helped.\"\n\nFifty years ... but that would bring the Gerns before Big Winter came\nagain. And there was the rapidly increasing chance that a Gern cruiser\nwould at any day intercept the first signals. They were already more\nthan halfway to Athena.\n\n\"Melt down the generator,\" he said. \"Start making a bigger one. Tomorrow\nmen will go out after bauxite and cryolite and four of us will go up the\nplateau to look for iron.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLake selected Gene Taylor, Tony Chiara and Steve Schroeder to go with\nhim. They were well on their way by daylight the next morning, on the\nshoulder of each of them a mocker which observed the activity and new\nscenes with bright, interested eyes.\n\nThey traveled light, since they would have fresh meat all the way, and\ncarried herbs and corn only for the mockers. Once, generations before,\nit had been necessary for men to eat herbs to prevent deficiency\ndiseases but now the deficiency diseases, like Hell Fever, were unknown\nto them.\n\nThey carried no compasses since the radiations of the two suns\nconstantly created magnetic storms that caused compass needles to swing\nas much as twenty degrees within an hour. Each of them carried a pair\nof powerful binoculars, however; binoculars that had been diamond-carved\nfrom the ivory-like black unicorn horn and set with lenses and prisms of\ndiamond-cut quartz.\n\nThe foremost bands of woods goats followed the advance of spring up the\nplateau and they followed the woods goats. They could not go ahead of\nthe goats--the goats were already pressing close behind the melting of\nthe snow. No hills or ridges were seen as the weeks went by and it\nseemed to Lake that they would walk forever across the endless rolling\nfloor of the plain.\n\nEarly summer came and they walked across a land that was green and\npleasantly cool at a time when the vegetation around the caves would be\nburned brown and lifeless. The woods goats grew less in number then as\nsome of them stopped for the rest of the summer in their chosen\nlatitudes.\n\nThey continued on and at last they saw, far to the north, what seemed to\nbe an almost infinitesimal bulge on the horizon. They reached it two\ndays later; a land of rolling green hills, scarred here and there with\nragged outcroppings of rock, and a land that climbed slowly and steadily\nhigher as it went into the north.\n\nThey camped that night in a little vale. The floor of it was white with\nthe bones of woods goats that had tarried too long the fall before and\ngot caught by an early blizzard. There was still flesh on the bones and\nscavenger rodents scuttled among the carcasses, feasting.\n\n\"We'll split up now,\" he told the others the next morning.\n\nHe assigned each of them his position; Steve Schroeder to parallel his\ncourse thirty miles to his right, Gene Taylor to go thirty miles to his\nleft, and Tony Chiara to go thirty miles to the left of Taylor.\n\n\"We'll try to hold those distances,\" he said. \"We can't look over the\ncountry in detail that way but it will give us a good general survey of\nit. We don't have too much time left by now and we'll make as many miles\ninto the north as we can each day. The woods goats will tell us when\nit's time for us to turn back.\"\n\nThey parted company with casual farewells but for Steve Schroeder, who\nsmiled sardonically at the bones of the woods goats in the vale and\nasked:\n\n\"Who's supposed to tell the woods goats?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTip, the black, white-nosed mocker on Lake's shoulder, kept twisting his\nneck to watch the departure of the others until he had crossed the next\nhill and the others were hidden from view.\n\n\"All right, Tip,\" he said then. \"You can unwind your neck now.\"\n\n\"Unwind--all right--all right,\" Tip said. Then, with a sudden burst of\nenergy which was characteristic of mockers, he began to jiggle up and\ndown and chant in time with his movements, \"All right all right all\nright all right----\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" he commanded. \"If you want to talk nonsense I don't care--but\ndon't say 'all right' any more.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Tip agreed amiably, settling down. \"Shut up if you want to\ntalk nonsense. I don't care.\"\n\n\"And don't slaughter the punctuation like that. You change the meaning\nentirely.\"\n\n\"But don't say all right any more,\" Tip went on, ignoring him. \"You\nchange the meaning entirely.\"\n\nThen, with another surge of animation, Tip began to fish in his jacket\npocket with little hand-like paws. \"Tip hungry--Tip hungry.\"\n\nLake unbuttoned the pocket and gave Tip a herb leaf. \"I notice there's\nno nonsensical chatter when you want to ask for something to eat.\"\n\nTip took the herb leaf but he spoke again before he began to eat;\nslowly, as though trying seriously to express a thought:\n\n\"Tip hungry--no nonsensical.\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he said, turning his head to look at Tip, \"you mockers give\nme the peculiar feeling that you're right on the edge of becoming a new\nand intelligent race and no fooling.\"\n\nTip wiggled his whiskers and bit into the herb leaf. \"No fooling,\" he\nagreed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stopped for the night in a steep-walled hollow and built a small\nfire of dead moss and grass to ward off the chill that came with dark.\nHe called the others, thinking first of Schroeder so that Tip would\ntransmit to Schroeder's mocker:\n\n\"Steve?\"\n\n\"Here,\" Tip answered, in a detectable imitation of Schroeder's voice.\n\"No luck.\"\n\nHe thought of Gene Taylor and called, \"Gene?\"\n\nThere was no answer and he called Chiara. \"Tony--could you see any of\nGene's route today?\"\n\n\"Part of it,\" Chiara answered. \"I saw a herd of unicorns over that way.\nWhy--doesn't he answer?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then,\" Chiara said, \"they must have got him.\"\n\n\"Did you find anything today, Tony?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nothing but pure andesite. Not even an iron stain.\"\n\nIt was the same kind of barren formation that he, himself, had been\nwalking over all day. But he had not expected success so soon....\n\nHe tried once again to call Gene Taylor:\n\n\"Gene ... Gene ... are you there, Gene?\"\n\nThere was no answer. He knew there would never be.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe days became weeks with dismaying swiftness as they penetrated\nfarther into the north. The hills became more rugged and there were\nintrusions of granite and other formations to promise a chance of\nfinding metal; a promise that urged them on faster as their time grew\nshorter.\n\nTwice he saw something white in the distance. Once it was the bones of\nanother band of woods goats that had huddled together and frozen to\ndeath in some early blizzard of the past and once it was the bones of a\ndozen unicorns.\n\nThe nights grew chillier and the suns moved faster and faster to the\nsouth. The animals began to migrate, an almost imperceptible movement in\nthe beginning but one that increased each day. The first frost came and\nthe migration began in earnest. By the third day it was a hurrying tide.\n\nTip was strangely silent that day. He did not speak until the noon sun\nhad cleared the cold, heavy mists of morning. When he spoke it was to\ngive a message from Chiara:\n\n\"Howard ... last report ... Goldie is dying ... pneumonia....\"\n\nGoldie was Chiara's mocker, his only means of communication--and there\nwould be no way to tell him when they were turning back.\n\n\"Turn back today, Tony,\" he said. \"Steve and I will go on for a few days\nmore.\"\n\nThere was no answer and he said quickly, \"Turn back--turn back!\nAcknowledge that, Tony.\"\n\n\"Turning back ...\" the acknowledgment came. \"... tried to save her....\"\n\nThe message stopped and there was a silence that Chiara's mocker would\nnever break again. He walked on, with Tip sitting very small and quiet\non his shoulder. He had crossed another hill before Tip moved, to press\nup close to him the way mockers did when they were lonely and to hold\ntightly to him.\n\n\"What is it, Tip?\" he asked.\n\n\"Goldie is dying,\" Tip said. And then again, like a soft, sad whisper,\n\"Goldie is dying....\"\n\n\"She was your mate.... I'm sorry.\"\n\nTip made a little whimpering sound, and the man reached up to stroke his\nsilky side.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said again. \"I'm sorry as hell, little fellow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor two days Tip sat lonely and silent on his shoulder, no longer\ninterested in the new scenes nor any longer relieving the monotony with\nhis chatter. He refused to eat until the morning of the third day.\n\nBy then the exodus of woods goats and unicorns had dwindled to almost\nnothing; the sky a leaden gray through which the sun could not be seen.\nThat evening he saw what he was sure would be the last band of woods\ngoats and shot one of them.\n\nWhen he went to it he was almost afraid to believe what he saw.\n\nThe hair above its feet was red, discolored with the stain of\niron-bearing clay.\n\nHe examined it more closely and saw that the goat had apparently watered\nat a spring where the mud was material washed down from an iron-bearing\nvein or formation. It had done so fairly recently--there were still tiny\nparticles of clay adhering to the hair.\n\nThe wind stirred, cold and damp with its warning of an approaching\nstorm. He looked to the north, where the evening had turned the gray\nclouds black, and called Schroeder:\n\n\"Steve--any luck?\"\n\n\"None,\" Schroeder answered.\n\n\"I just killed a goat,\" he said. \"It has iron stains on its legs it got\nat some spring farther north. I'm going on to try to find it. You can\nturn back in the morning.\"\n\n\"No,\" Schroeder objected. \"I can angle over and catch up with you in a\ncouple of days.\"\n\n\"You'll turn back in the morning,\" he said. \"I'm going to try to find\nthis iron. But if I get caught by a blizzard it will be up to you to\ntell them at the caves that I found iron and to tell them where it\nis--you know the mockers can't transmit that far.\"\n\nThere was a short silence; then Schroeder said, \"All right--I see. I'll\nhead south in the morning.\"\n\nLake took a route the next day that would most likely be the one the\nwoods goats had come down, stopping on each ridge top to study the\ncountry ahead of him through his binoculars. It was cloudy all day but\nat sunset the sun appeared very briefly, to send its last rays across\nthe hills and redden them in mockery of the iron he sought.\n\nFar ahead of him, small even through the glasses and made visible only\nbecause of the position of the sun, was a spot at the base of a hill\nthat was redder than the sunset had made the other hills.\n\nHe was confident it would be the red clay he was searching for and he\nhurried on, not stopping until darkness made further progress\nimpossible.\n\nTip slept inside his jacket, curled up against his chest, while the wind\nblew raw and cold all through the night. He was on his way again at the\nfirst touch of daylight, the sky darker than ever and the wind spinning\nrandom flakes of snow before him.\n\nHe stopped to look back to the south once, thinking, _If I turn back now\nI might get out before the blizzard hits._\n\nThen the other thought came: _These hills all look the same. It I don't\ngo to the iron while I'm this close and know where it is, it might be\nyears before I or anyone else could find it again._\n\nHe went on and did not look back again for the rest of the day.\n\nBy midafternoon the higher hills around him were hidden under the clouds\nand the snow was coming harder and faster as the wind drove the flakes\nagainst his face. It began to snow with a heaviness that brought a half\ndarkness when he came finally to the hill he had seen through the\nglasses.\n\nA spring was at the base of it, bubbling out of red clay. Above it the\nred dirt led a hundred feet to a dike of granite and stopped. He hurried\nup the hillside that was rapidly whitening with snow and saw the vein.\n\nIt set against the dike, short and narrow but red-black with the iron it\ncontained. He picked up a piece and felt the weight of it. It was\nheavy--it was pure iron oxide.\n\nHe called Schroeder and asked, \"Are you down out of the high hills,\nSteve?\"\n\n\"I'm in the lower ones,\" Schroeder answered, the words coming a little\nmuffled from where Tip lay inside his jacket. \"It looks black as hell up\nyour way.\"\n\n\"I found the iron, Steve. Listen--these are the nearest to landmarks I\ncan give you....\"\n\nWhen he had finished he said, \"That's the best I can do. You can't see\nthe red clay except when the sun is low in the southwest but I'm going\nto build a monument on top of the hill to find it by.\"\n\n\"About you, Howard,\" Steve asked, \"what are your chances?\"\n\nThe wind was rising to a high moaning around the ledges of the granite\ndike and the vein was already invisible under the snow.\n\n\"It doesn't look like they're very good,\" he answered. \"You'll probably\nbe leader when you come back next spring--I told the council I wanted\nthat if anything happened to me. Keep things going the way I would have.\nNow--I'll have to hurry to get the monument built in time.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Schroeder said. \"So long, Howard ... good luck.\"\n\nHe climbed to the top of the hill and saw boulders there he could use to\nbuild the monument. They were large--he might crush Tip against his\nchest in picking them up--and he took off his jacket, to wrap it around\nTip and leave him lying on the ground.\n\nHe worked until he was panting for breath, the wind driving the snow\nharder and harder against him until the cold seemed to have penetrated\nto the bone. He worked until the monument was too high for his numb\nhands to lift any more boulders to its top. By then it was tall enough\nthat it should serve its purpose.\n\nHe went back to look for Tip, the ground already four inches deep in\nsnow and the darkness almost complete.\n\n\"Tip,\" he called. \"Tip--Tip----\" He walked back and forth across the\nhillside in the area where he thought he had left him, stumbling over\nrocks buried in the snow and invisible in the darkness, calling against\nthe wind and thinking, _I can't leave him to die alone here._\n\nThen, from a bulge he had not seen in the snow under him, there came a\nfrightened, lonely wail:\n\n_\"Tip cold--Tip cold----\"_\n\nHe raked the snow off his jacket and unwrapped Tip, to put him inside\nhis shirt next to his bare skin. Tip's paws were like ice and he was\nshivering violently, the first symptom of the pneumonia that killed\nmockers so quickly.\n\nTip coughed, a wrenching, rattling little sound, and whimpered,\n\"Hurt--hurt----\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said. \"Your lungs hurt--damn it to hell, I wish I could\nhave let you go home with Steve.\"\n\nHe put on the cold jacket and went down the hill. There was nothing\nwith which he could make a fire--only the short half-green grass,\nalready buried under the snow. He turned south at the bottom of the\nhill, determining the direction by the wind, and began the stubborn\nmarch southward that could have but one ending.\n\nHe walked until his cold-numbed legs would carry him no farther. The\nsnow was warm when he fell for the last time; warm and soft as it\ndrifted over him, and his mind was clouded with a pleasant drowsiness.\n\n_This isn't so bad_, he thought, and there was something like surprise\nthrough the drowsiness. _I can't regret doing what I had to do--doing it\nthe best I could...._\n\nTip was no longer coughing and the thought of Tip was the only one that\nwas tinged with regret: _I hope he wasn't still hurting when he died._\n\nHe felt Tip still very feebly against his chest then, and he did not\nknow if it was his imagination or if in that last dreamlike state it was\nTip's thought that came to him; warm and close and reassuring him:\n\n_No hurt no cold now--all right now--we sleep now...._\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                 PART 3\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nWhen spring came Steve Schroeder was leader, as Lake had wanted. It was\na duty and a responsibility that would be under circumstances different\nfrom those of any of the leaders before him. The grim fight was over for\na while. They were adapted and increasing in number; going into Big\nSummer and into a renascence that would last for fifty years. They would\nhave half a century in which to develop their environment to its fullest\nextent. Then Big Fall would come, to destroy all they had accomplished,\nand the Gerns would come, to destroy them.\n\nIt was his job to make certain that by then they would be stronger than\neither.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe went north with nine men as soon as the weather permitted. It was\nhard to retrace the route of the summer before, without compasses, among\nthe hills which looked all the same as far as their binoculars could\nreach, and it was summer when they saw the hill with the monument. They\nfound Lake's bones a few miles south of it, scattered by the scavengers\nas were the little bones of his mocker. They buried them together, man\nand mocker, and went silently on toward the hill.\n\nThey had brought a little hand-cranked diamond drill with them to bore\nholes in the hard granite and black powder for blasting. They mined the\nvein, sorting out the ore from the waste and saving every particle.\n\nThe vein was narrow at the surface and pinched very rapidly. At a depth\nof six feet it was a knife-blade seam; at ten feet it was only a red\ndiscoloration in the bottom of their shaft.\n\n\"That seems to be all of it,\" he said to the others. \"We'll send men up\nhere next year to go deeper and farther along its course but I have an\nidea we've just mined all of the only iron vein on Ragnarok. It will be\nenough for our purpose.\"\n\nThey sewed the ore in strong rawhide sacks and then prospected, without\nsuccess, until it was time for the last unicorn band to pass by on its\nway south. They trapped ten unicorns and hobbled their legs, with other\nropes reaching from horn to hind leg on each side to prevent them from\nswinging back their heads or even lifting them high.\n\nThey had expected the capture and hobbling of the unicorns to be a\ndifficult and dangerous job and it was. But when they were finished the\nunicorns were helpless. They could move awkwardly about to graze but\nthey could not charge. They could only stand with lowered heads and fume\nand rumble.\n\nThe ore sacks were tied on one frosty morning and the men mounted. The\nhorn-leg ropes were loosened so the unicorns could travel, and the\nunicorns went into a frenzy of bucking and rearing, squealing with rage\nas they tried to impale their riders.\n\nThe short spears, stabbing at the sensitive spot behind the jawbones of\nthe unicorns, thwarted the backward flung heads and the unicorns were\nslowly forced into submission. The last one conceded temporary defeat\nand the long journey to the south started, the unicorns going in the run\nthat they could maintain hour after hour.\n\nEach day they pushed the unicorns until they were too weary to fight at\nnight. Each morning, rested, the unicorns resumed the battle. It became\nan expected routine for both unicorns and men.\n\nThe unicorns were released when the ore was unloaded at the foot of the\nhill before the caves and Schroeder went to the new waterwheel, where\nthe new generator was already in place. There George Craig told him of\nthe unexpected obstacle that had appeared.\n\n\"We're stuck,\" George said. \"The aluminum ore isn't what we thought it\nwould be. It's scarce and very low grade, of such a complex nature that\nwe can't refine it to the oxide with what we have to work with on\nRagnarok.\"\n\n\"Have you produced any aluminum oxide at all?\" Schroeder asked.\n\n\"A little. We might have enough for the wire in a hundred years if we\nkept at it hard enough.\"\n\n\"What else do you need--was there enough cryolite?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not much of it, but enough. We have the generator set up, the smelting\nbox built and the carbon lining and rods ready. We have everything we\nneed to smelt aluminum ore--except the aluminum ore.\"\n\n\"Go ahead and finish up the details, such as installing the lining,\" he\nsaid. \"We didn't get this far to be stopped now.\"\n\nBut the prospecting parties, making full use of the time left them\nbefore winter closed down, returned late that fall to report no sign of\nthe ore they needed.\n\nSpring came and he was determined they would be smelting aluminum before\nthe summer was over even though he had no idea where the ore would be\nfound. They needed aluminum ore of a grade high enough that they could\nextract the pure aluminum oxide. Specifically, they needed aluminum\noxide....\n\nThen he saw the answer to their problem, so obvious that all of them had\noverlooked it.\n\nHe passed by four children playing a game in front of the caves that\nday; some kind of a checker-like game in which differently colored rocks\nrepresented the different children. One boy was using red stones; some\nof the rubies that had been brought back as curios from the chasm.\nRubies were of no use or value on Ragnarok; only pretty rocks for\nchildren to play with....\n\nOnly pretty rocks?--_rubies and sapphires were corundum, were pure\naluminum oxide!_\n\nHe went to tell George and to arrange for a party of men to go into the\nchasm after all the rubies and sapphires they could find. The last\nobstacle had been surmounted.\n\nThe summer sun was hot the day the generator hummed into life. The\ncarbon-lined smelting box was ready and the current flowed between the\nheavy carbon rods suspended in the cryolite and the lining, transforming\nthe cryolite into a liquid. The crushed rubies and sapphires were fed\ninto the box, glowing and glittering in blood-red and sky-blue\nscintillations of light, to be deprived by the current of their life and\nfire and be changed into something entirely different.\n\nWhen the time came to draw off some of the metal they opened the orifice\nin the lower corner of the box. Molten aluminum flowed out into the\ningot mold in a little stream; more beautiful to them than any gems\ncould ever be, bright and gleaming in its promise that more than six\ngenerations of imprisonment would soon be ended.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe aluminum smelting continued until the supply of rubies and sapphires\nin the chasm had been exhausted but for small and scattered fragments.\nIt was enough, with some aluminum above the amount needed for the wire.\n\nIt was the year one hundred and fifty-two when they smelted the\naluminum. In eight more years they would reach the middle of Big Summer;\nthe suns would start their long drift southward, not to return for one\nhundred and fifty years. Time was passing swiftly by for them and there\nwas none of it to waste....\n\nThe making of ceramics was developed to an art, as was the making of\ndifferent types of glass. Looms were built to spin thread and cloth from\nwoods goat wool, and vegetable dyes were discovered. Exploration parties\ncrossed the continent to the eastern and western seas: salty and\nlifeless seas that were bordered by immense deserts. No trees of any\nkind grew along their shores and ships could not be built to cross them.\n\nEfforts were continued to develop an inorganic field of chemistry, with\ndiscouraging results, but in one hundred and fifty-nine the orange corn\nwas successfully adapted to the elevation and climate of the caves.\n\nThere was enough that year to feed the mockers all winter, supply next\nyear's seeds, and leave enough that it could be ground and baked into\nbread for all to taste.\n\nIt tasted strange, but good. It was, Schroeder thought, symbolic of a\ngreat forward step. It was the first time in generations that any of\nthem had known any food but meat. The corn would make them less\ndependent upon hunting and, of paramount importance, it was the type of\nfood to which they would have to become accustomed in the future--they\ncould not carry herds of woods goats and unicorns with them on Gern\nbattle cruisers.\n\nThe lack of metals hindered them wherever they turned in their efforts\nto build even the simplest machines or weapons. Despite its dubious\nprospects, however, they made a rifle-like gun.\n\nThe barrel of it was thick, of the hardest, toughest ceramic material\nthey could produce. It was a cumbersome, heavy thing, firing with a\nflintlock action, and it could not be loaded with much powder lest the\ncharge burst the barrel.\n\nThe flintlock ignition was not instantaneous, the lightweight porcelain\nbullet had far less penetrating power than an arrow, and the thing\nboomed and belched out a cloud of smoke that would have shown the Gerns\nexactly where the shooter was located.\n\nIt was an interesting curio and the firing of it was something\nspectacular to behold but it was a weapon apt to be much more dangerous\nto the man behind it than to the Gern it was aimed at. Automatic\ncrossbows were far better.\n\nWoods goats had been trapped and housed during the summers in shelters\nwhere sprays of water maintained a temperature cool enough for them to\nsurvive. Only the young were kept when fall came, to be sheltered\nthrough the winter in one of the caves. Each new generation was\nsubjected to more heat in the summer and more cold in the winter than\nthe generation before it and by the year one hundred and sixty the woods\ngoats were well on their way toward adaptation.\n\nThe next year they trapped two unicorns, to begin the job of adapting\nand taming future generations of them. If they succeeded they would have\nutilized the resources of Ragnarok to the limit--except for what should\nbe their most valuable ally with which to fight the Gerns: the\nprowlers.\n\nFor twenty years prowlers had observed a truce wherein they would not go\nhunting for men if men would stay away from their routes of travel. But\nit was a truce only and there was no indication that it could ever\nevolve into friendship.\n\nThree times in the past, half-grown prowlers had been captured and caged\nin the hope of taming them. Each time they had paced their cages,\nlooking longingly into the distance, refusing to eat and defiant until\nthey died.\n\nTo prowlers, as to some men, freedom was more precious than life. And\neach time a prowler had been captured the free ones had retaliated with\na resurgence of savage attacks.\n\nThere seemed no way that men and prowlers could ever meet on common\nground. They were alien to one another, separated by the gulf of an\norigin on worlds two hundred and fifty light-years apart. Their only\ncommon heritage was the will of each to battle.\n\nBut in the spring of one hundred and sixty-one, for a little while one\nday, the gulf was bridged.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSchroeder was returning from a trip he had taken alone to the east,\ncoming down the long canyon that led from the high face of the plateau\nto the country near the caves. He hurried, glancing back at the black\nclouds that had gathered so quickly on the mountain behind him. Thunder\nrumbled from within them, an almost continuous roll of it as the clouds\npoured down their deluge of water.\n\nA cloudburst was coming and the sheer-walled canyon down which he\nhurried had suddenly become a death trap, its sunlit quiet soon to be\ntransformed into roaring destruction. There was only one place along its\nnine-mile length where he might climb out and the time was already short\nin which to reach it.\n\nHe had increased his pace to a trot when he came to it, a talus of\nbroken rock that sloped up steeply for thirty feet to a shelf. A ledge\neleven feet high stood over the shelf and other, lower, ledges set back\nfrom it like climbing steps.\n\nAt the foot of the talus he stopped to listen, wondering how close\nbehind him the water might be. He heard it coming, a sound like the\nroaring of a high wind up the canyon, and he scrambled up the talus of\nloose rock to the shelf at its top. The shelf was not high enough above\nthe canyon's floor--he would be killed there--and he followed it fifty\nfeet around a sharp bend. There it narrowed abruptly, to merge into the\nsheer wall of the canyon. Blind alley....\n\nHe ran back to the top of the talus where the edge of the ledge, ragged\nwith projections of rock, was unreachably far above him. As he did so\nthe roaring was suddenly a crashing, booming thunder and he saw the\nwater coming.\n\nIt swept around the bend at perhaps a hundred miles an hour, stretching\nfrom wall to wall of the canyon, the crest of it seething and slashing\nand towering forty sheer feet above the canyon's floor.\n\nA prowler was running in front of it, running for its life and losing.\n\nThere was no time to watch. He leaped upward, as high as possible, his\ncrossbow in his hand. He caught the end of the bow over one of the sharp\nprojections of rock on the ledge's rim and began to pull himself up,\nafraid to hurry lest the rock cut the bowstring in two and drop him\nback.\n\nIt held and he stood on the ledge, safe, as the prowler flashed up the\ntalus below.\n\nIt darted around the blind-alley shelf and was back a moment later. It\nsaw that its only chance would be to leap up on the ledge where he stood\nand it tried, handicapped by the steep, loose slope it had to jump from.\n\nIt failed and fell back. It tried again, hurling itself upward with all\nits strength, and its claws caught fleetingly on the rough rock a foot\nbelow the rim. It began to slide back, with no time left it for a third\ntry.\n\nIt looked up at the rim of safety that it had not quite reached and then\non up at him, its eyes bright and cold with the knowledge that it was\ngoing to die and its enemy would watch it.\n\nSchroeder dropped flat on his stomach and reached down, past the massive\nblack head, to seize the prowler by the back of the neck. He pulled up\nwith all his strength and the claws of the prowler tore at the rocks as\nit climbed.\n\nWhen it was coming up over the ledge, safe, he rolled back from it and\ncame to his feet in one swift, wary motion, his eyes on it and his knife\nalready in his hand. As he did so the water went past below them with a\nthunder that deafened. Logs and trees shot past, boulders crashed\ntogether, and things could be seen surging in the brown depths;\nshapeless things that had once been woods goats and the battered gray\nbulk of a unicorn. He saw it all with a sideward glance, his attention\non the prowler.\n\nIt stepped back from the rim of the ledge and looked at him; warily, as\nhe looked at it. With the wariness was something like question, and\nalmost disbelief.\n\nThe ledge they stood on was narrow but it led out of the canyon and to\nthe open land beyond. He motioned to the prowler to precede him and,\nhesitating a moment, it did so.\n\nThey climbed out of the canyon and out onto the grassy slope of the\nmountainside. The roar of the water was a distant rumble there and he\nstopped. The prowler did the same and they watched each other again,\neach of them trying to understand what the thoughts of the other might\nbe. It was something they could not know--they were too alien to each\nother and had been enemies too long.\n\nThen a gust of wind swept across them, bending and rippling the tall\ngrass, and the prowler swung away to go with it and leave him standing\nalone.\n\nHis route was such that it diverged gradually from that taken by the\nprowler. He went through a grove of trees and emerged into an open glade\non the other side. Up on the ridge to his right he saw something black\nfor a moment, already far away.\n\nHe was thirty feet from the next grove of trees when he saw the gray\nshadow waiting silently for his coming within them.\n\nUnicorn!\n\nHis crossbow rattled as he jerked back the pistol grip. The unicorn\ncharged, the underbrush crackling as it tore through it and a vine\nwhipping like a rope from its lowered horn.\n\nHis first arrow went into its chest. It lurched, fatally wounded but\nstill coming, and he jerked back on the pistol grip for the quick shot\nthat would stop it.\n\nThe rock-frayed bow string broke with a singing sound and the bow ends\nsnapped harmlessly forward.\n\nHe had counted on the bow and its failure came a fraction of a second\ntoo late for him to dodge far enough. His sideward leap was short, and\nthe horn caught him in midair, ripping across his ribs and breaking\nthem, shattering the bone of his left arm and tearing the flesh. He was\nhurled fifteen feet and he struck the ground with a stunning impact,\npain washing over him in a blinding wave.\n\nThrough it, dimly, he saw the unicorn fall and heard its dying trumpet\nblast as it called to another. He heard an answering call somewhere in\nthe distance and then the faraway drumming of hooves.\n\nHe fought back the blindness and used his good arm to lift himself up.\nHis bow was useless, his spear lay broken under the unicorn, and his\nknife was gone. His left arm swung helplessly and he could not climb the\nlimbless lower trunk of a lance tree with only one arm.\n\nHe went forward, limping, trying to hurry to find his knife while the\ndrumming of hooves raced toward him. It would be a battle already lost\nthat he would make with the short knife but he would have blood for his\ngoing....\n\nThe grass grew tall and thick, hiding the knife until he could hear the\nunicorn crashing through the trees. He saw it ten feet ahead of him as\nthe unicorn tore out from the edge of the woods thirty feet away.\n\nIt squealed, shrill with triumph, and the horn swept up to impale him.\nThere was no time left to reach the knife, no time left for anything but\nthe last fleeting sight of sunshine and glade and arching blue sky----\n\nSomething from behind him shot past and up at the unicorn's throat, a\nthing that was snarling black savagery with yellow eyes blazing and\nwhite fangs slashing--the prowler!\n\nIt ripped at the unicorn's throat, swerving its charge, and the unicorn\nplunged past him. The unicorn swung back, all the triumph gone from its\nsqueal, and the prowler struck again. They became a swirling blur, the\nhorn of the unicorn swinging and stabbing and the attacks of the prowler\nlike the swift, relentless thrusting of a rapier.\n\nHe went to his knife and when he turned back with it in his hand the\nbattle was already over.\n\nThe unicorn fell and the prowler turned away from it. One foreleg was\nbathed in blood and its chest was heaving with a panting so fast that it\ncould not have been caused by the fight with the unicorn.\n\n_It must have been watching me_, he thought, with a strange feeling of\nwonder. _It was watching from the ridge and it ran all the way._\n\nIts yellow eyes flickered to the knife in his hand. He dropped the knife\nin the grass and walked forward, unarmed, wanting the prowler to know\nthat he understood; that for them in that moment the gulf of two hundred\nand fifty light-years did not exist.\n\nHe stopped near it and squatted in the grass to begin binding up his\nbroken arm so the bones would not grate together. It watched him, then\nit began to lick at its bloody shoulder; standing so close to him that\nhe could have reached out and touched it.\n\nAgain he felt the sense of wonder. They were alone together in the\nglade, he and a prowler, each caring for his hurts. There was a bond\nbetween them that for a little while made them like brothers. There was\na bridge for a little while across the gulf that had never been bridged\nbefore....\n\nWhen he had finished with his arm and the prowler had lessened the\nbleeding of its shoulder it took a step back toward the ridge. He stood\nup, knowing it was going to leave.\n\n\"I suppose the score is even now,\" he said to it, \"and we'll never see\neach other again. So good hunting--and thanks.\"\n\nIt made a sound in its throat; a queer sound that was neither bark nor\ngrowl, and he had the feeling it was trying to tell him something. Then\nit turned and was gone like a black shadow across the grass and he was\nalone again.\n\nHe picked up his knife and bow and began the long, painful journey back\nto the caves, looking again and again at the ridge behind him and\nthinking: _They have a code of ethics. They fight for their\nsurvival--but they pay their debts._\n\nRagnarok was big enough for both men and prowlers. They could live\ntogether in friendship as men and dogs of Earth lived together. It might\ntake a long time to win the trust of the prowlers but surely it could be\ndone.\n\nHe came to the rocky trail that led to the caves and there he took a\nlast look at the ridge behind him; feeling a poignant sense of loss and\nwondering if he would ever see the prowler again or ever again know the\nstrange, wild companionship he had known that day.\n\nPerhaps he never would ... but the time would come on Ragnarok when\nchildren would play in the grass with prowler pups and the time would\ncome when men and prowlers, side by side, would face the Gerns.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the year that followed there were two incidents when a prowler had\nthe opportunity to kill a hunter on prowler territory and did not do so.\nThere was no way of knowing if the prowler in each case had been the one\nhe had saved from the cloudburst or if the prowlers, as a whole, were\nrespecting what a human had done for one of them.\n\nSchroeder thought of again trying to capture prowler pups--very young\nones--and decided it would be a stupid plan. Such an act would destroy\nall that had been done toward winning the trust of the prowlers. It\nwould be better to wait, even though time was growing short, and find\nsome other way.\n\nThe fall of one hundred and sixty-three came and the suns were\nnoticeably moving south. That was the fall that his third child, a\ngirl, was born. She was named Julia, after the Julia of long ago, and\nshe was of the last generation that would be born in the caves.\n\nPlans were already under way to build a town in the valley a mile from\nthe caves. The unicorn-proof stockade wall that would enclose it was\nalready under construction, being made of stone blocks. The houses would\nbe of diamond-sawed stone, thick-walled, with dead-air spaces between\nthe double walls to insulate against heat and cold. Tall, wide canopies\nof lance tree poles and the palm-like medusabush leaves would be built\nover all the houses to supply additional shade.\n\nThe woods goats were fully adapted that year and domesticated to such an\nextent that they had no desire to migrate with the wild goats. There was\na small herd of them then, enough to supply a limited amount of milk,\ncheese and wool.\n\nThe adaptation of the unicorns proceeded in the following years, but not\ntheir domestication. It was their nature to be ill-tempered and\ntreacherous and only the threat of the spears in the hands of their\ndrivers forced them to work; work that they could have done easily had\nthey not diverted so much effort each day to trying to turn on their\nmasters and kill them. Each night they were put in a massive-walled\ncorral, for they were almost as dangerous as wild unicorns.\n\nThe slow, painstaking work on the transmitter continued while the suns\nmoved farther south each year. The move from the caves to the new town\nwas made in one hundred and seventy-nine, the year that Schroeder's wife\ndied.\n\nHis two sons were grown and married and Julia, at sixteen, was a woman\nby Ragnarok standards; blue-eyed and black-haired as her mother, a\nCraig, had been, and strikingly pretty in a wild, reckless way. She\nmarried Will Humbolt that spring, leaving her father alone in the new\nhouse in the new town.\n\nFour months later she came to him to announce with pride and excitement:\n\n\"I'm going to have a baby in only six months! If it's a boy he'll be the\nright age to be leader when the Gerns come and we're going to name him\nJohn, after the John who was the first leader we ever had on Ragnarok.\"\n\nHer words brought to his mind a question and he thought of what old Dale\nCraig, the leader who had preceded Lake, had written:\n\n_We have survived, the generations that the Gerns thought would never be\nborn. But we must never forget the characteristics that insured that\nsurvival: an unswerving loyalty of every individual to all the others\nand the courage to fight, and die if necessary.\n\nIn any year, now, the Gerns will come. There will be no one to help us.\nThose on Athena are slaves and it is probable that Earth has been\nenslaved by now. We will stand or fall alone. But if we of today could\nknow that the ones who meet the Gerns will still have the courage and\nloyalty that made our survival possible, then we would know that the\nGerns are already defeated...._\n\nThe era of danger and violence was over for a little while. The younger\ngeneration had grown up during a time of peaceful development of their\nenvironment. It was a peace that the coming of the Gerns would\nshatter--but had it softened the courage and loyalty of the younger\ngeneration?\n\nA week later he was given his answer.\n\nHe was climbing up the hill that morning, high above the town below,\nwhen he saw the blue of Julia's wool blouse in the distance. She was\nsitting up on a hillside, an open book in her lap and her short spear\nlying beside her.\n\nHe frowned at the sight. The main southward migration of unicorns was\nover but there were often lone stragglers who might appear at any time.\nHe had warned her that someday a unicorn would kill her--but she was\nreckless by nature and given to restless moods in which she could not\nstand the confinement of the town.\n\nShe jerked up her head as he watched, as though at a faint sound, and he\nsaw the first movement within the trees behind her--a unicorn.\n\nIt lunged forward, its stealth abandoned as she heard it, and she came\nto her feet in a swift, smooth movement; the spear in her hand and the\nbook spilling to the ground.\n\nThe unicorn's squeal rang out and she whirled to face it, with two\nseconds to live. He reached for his bow, knowing his help would come too\nlate.\n\nShe did the only thing possible that might enable her to survive: she\nshifted her balance to take advantage of the fact that a human could\njump to one side a little more quickly than a four-footed beast in\nheadlong charge. As she did so she brought up the spear for the thrust\ninto the vulnerable area just behind the jawbone.\n\nIt seemed the needle point of the black horn was no more than an arm's\nlength from her stomach when she jumped aside with the lithe quickness\nof a prowler, swinging as she jumped and thrusting the spear with all\nher strength into the unicorn's neck.\n\nThe thrust was true and the spear went deep. She released it and flung\nherself backward to dodge the flying hooves. The force of the unicorn's\ncharge took it past her but its legs collapsed under it and it crashed\nto the ground, sliding a little way before it stopped. It kicked once\nand lay still.\n\nShe went to it, to retrieve her spear, and even from the distance there\nwas an air of pride about her as she walked past her bulky victim.\n\nThen she saw the book, knocked to one side by the unicorn's hooves.\nTatters of its pages were blowing in the wind and she stiffened, her\nface growing pale. She ran to it to pick it up, the unicorn forgotten.\n\nShe was trying to smooth the torn leaves when he reached her. It had\nbeen one of the old textbooks, printed on real paper, and it was fragile\nwith age. She had been trusted by the librarian to take good care of it.\nNow, page after page was torn and unreadable....\n\nShe looked up at him, shame and misery on her face.\n\n\"Father,\" she said. \"The book--I----\"\n\nHe saw that the unicorn was a bull considerably larger than the average.\nMen had in the past killed unicorns with spears but never, before, had a\nsixteen-year-old girl done so....\n\nHe looked back at her, keeping his face emotionless, and asked sternly,\n\"You what?\"\n\n\"I guess--I guess I didn't have any right to take the book out of town.\nI wish I hadn't....\"\n\n\"You promised to take good care of it,\" he told her coldly. \"Your\npromise was believed and you were trusted to keep it.\"\n\n\"But--but I didn't mean to damage it--I didn't mean to!\" She was\nsuddenly very near to tears. \"I'm not a--a _bemmon_!\"\n\n\"Go back to town,\" he ordered. \"Tonight bring the book to the town hall\nand tell the council what happened to it.\"\n\nShe swallowed and said in a faint voice, \"Yes, father.\"\n\nShe turned and started slowly back down the hill, not seeing the unicorn\nas she passed it, the bloody spear trailing disconsolately behind her\nand her head hanging in shame.\n\nHe watched her go and it was safe for him to smile. When night came and\nshe stood before the council, ashamed to lift her eyes to look at them,\nhe would have to be grim and stern as he told her how she had been\ntrusted and how she had betrayed that trust. But now, as he watched her\ngo down the hill, he could smile with his pride in her and know that his\nquestion was answered; that the younger generation had lost neither\ncourage nor loyalty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJulia saved a child's life that spring and almost lost her own. The\nchild was playing under a half-completed canopy when a sudden, violent\nwind struck it and transformed it into a death-trap of cracking, falling\ntimbers. She reached him in time to fling him to safety but the\ncollapsing roof caught her before she could make her own escape.\n\nHer chest and throat were torn by the jagged ends of the broken poles\nand for a day and a night her life was a feebly flickering spark. She\nbegan to rally on the second night and on the third morning she was able\nto speak for the first time, her eyes dark and tortured with her fear:\n\n\"My baby--what did it do to him?\"\n\nShe convalesced slowly, haunted by the fear. Her son was born five\nweeks later and her fears proved to have been groundless. He was\nperfectly normal and healthy.\n\nAnd hungry--and her slowly healing breasts would be dry for weeks to\ncome.\n\nBy a coincidence that had never happened before and could never happen\nagain there was not a single feeding-time foster-mother available for\nthe baby. There were many expectant mothers but only three women had\nyoung babies--and each of the three had twins to feed.\n\nBut there was a small supply of frozen goat milk in the ice house,\nenough to see young Johnny through until it was time for the goat herd\nto give milk. He would have to live on short rations until then but it\ncould not be helped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJohnny was a month old when the opportunity came for the men of Ragnarok\nto have their ultimate ally.\n\nThe last of the unicorns were going north and the prowlers had long\nsince gone. The blue star was lighting the night like a small sun when\nthe breeze coming through Schroeder's window brought the distant\nsquealing of unicorns.\n\nHe listened, wondering. It was a sound that did not belong. Everyone was\nsafely in the town, most of them in bed, and there should be nothing\noutside the stockade for the unicorns to fight.\n\nHe armed himself with spear and crossbow and went outside. He let\nhimself out through the east gate and went toward the sounds of battle.\nThey grew louder as he approached, more furious, as though the battle\nwas reaching its climax.\n\nHe crossed the creek and went through the trees beyond. There, in a\nsmall clearing no more than half a mile from the town, he came upon the\nscene.\n\nA lone prowler was making a stand against two unicorns. Two other\nunicorns lay on the ground, dead, and behind the prowler was the dark\nshape of its mate lying lifelessly in the grass. There was blood on the\nprowler, purple in the blue starlight, and gloating rang in the squeals\nof the unicorns as they lunged at it. The leaps of the prowler were\nfaltering as it fought them, the last desperate defiance of an animal\nalready dying.\n\nHe brought up the bow and sent a volley of arrows into the unicorns.\nTheir gloating squeals died and they fell. The prowler staggered and\nfell beside them.\n\nIt was breathing its last when he reached it but in the way it looked up\nat him he had the feeling that it wanted to tell him something, that it\nwas trying hard to live long enough to do so. It died with the strange\nappeal in its eyes and not until then did he see the scar on its\nshoulder; a scar such as might have been made long ago by the rip of a\nunicorn's horn.\n\nIt was the prowler he had known nineteen years before.\n\nThe ground was trampled all around by the unicorns, showing that the\nprowlers had been besieged all day. He went to the other prowler and saw\nit was a female. Her breasts showed that she had had pups recently but\nshe had been dead at least two days. Her hind legs had been broken\nsometime that spring and they were still only half healed, twisted and\nalmost useless.\n\nThen, that was why the two of them were so far behind the other\nprowlers. Prowlers, like the wolves, coyotes and foxes of Earth, mated\nfor life and the male helped take care of the young. She had been\ninjured somewhere to the south, perhaps in a fight with unicorns, and\nher mate had stayed with her as she hobbled her slow way along and\nkilled game for her. The pups had been born and they had had to stop.\nThen the unicorns had found them and the female had been too crippled to\nfight....\n\nHe looked for the pups, expecting to find them trampled and dead. But\nthey were alive, hidden under the roots of a small tree near their\nmother.\n\nProwler pups--_alive!_\n\nThey were very young, small and blind and helpless. He picked them up\nand his elation drained away as he looked at them. They made little\nsounds of hunger, almost inaudible, and they moved feebly, trying to\nfind their mother's breasts and already so weak that they could not lift\ntheir heads.\n\nSmall chunks of fresh meat had been left beside the pups and he thought\nof what the prowler's emotions must have been as his mate lay dead on\nthe ground and he carried meat to their young, knowing they were too\nsmall to eat it but helpless to do anything else for them.\n\nAnd he knew why there had been the appeal in the eyes of the prowler as\nit died and what it had tried to tell him: _Save them ... as you once\nsaved me._\n\nHe carried the pups back past the prowler and looked down at it in\npassing. \"I'll do my best,\" he said.\n\nWhen he reached his house he laid the pups on his bed and built a fire.\nThere was no milk to give them--the goats would not have young for at\nleast another two weeks--but perhaps they could eat a soup of some kind.\nHe put water on to boil and began shredding meat to make them a rich\nbroth.\n\nOne of them was a male, the other a female, and if he could save them\nthey would fight beside the men of Ragnarok when the Gerns came. He\nthought of what he would name them as he worked. He would name the\nfemale Sigyn, after Loki's faithful wife who went with him when the gods\ncondemned him to Hel, the Teutonic underworld. And he would name the\nmale Fenrir, after the monster wolf who would fight beside Loki when\nLoki led the forces of Hel in the final battle on the day of Ragnarok.\n\nBut when the broth was prepared, and cooled enough, the pups could not\neat it. He tried making it weaker, tried it mixed with corn and herb\nsoup, tried corn and herb soups alone. They could eat nothing he\nprepared for them.\n\nWhen gray daylight entered the room he had tried everything possible and\nhad failed. He sat wearily in his chair and watched them, defeated. They\nwere no longer crying in their hunger and when he touched them they did\nnot move as they had done before.\n\nThey would be dead before the day was over and the only chance men had\never had to have prowlers as their friends and allies would be gone.\n\nThe first rays of sunrise were coming into the room, revealing fully\nthe frail thinness of the pups, when there was a step outside and\nJulia's voice:\n\n\"Father?\"\n\n\"Come in, Julia,\" he said, not moving.\n\nShe entered, still a pale shadow of the reckless girl who had fought a\nunicorn, even though she was slowly regaining her normal health. She\ncarried young Johnny in one arm, in her other hand his little bottle of\nmilk. Johnny was hungry--there was never quite enough milk for him--but\nhe was not crying. Ragnarok children did not cry....\n\nShe saw the pups and her eyes went wide.\n\n\"Prowlers--baby prowlers! Where did you get them?\"\n\nHe told her and she went to them, to look down at them and say, \"If you\nand their father hadn't helped each other that day they wouldn't be\nhere, nor you, nor I, nor Johnny--none of us in this room.\"\n\n\"They won't live out the day,\" he said. \"They have to have milk--and\nthere isn't any.\"\n\nShe reached down to touch them and they seemed to sense that she was\nsomeone different. They stirred, making tiny whimpering sounds and\ntrying to move their heads to nuzzle at her fingers.\n\nCompassion came to her face, like a soft light.\n\n\"They're so young,\" she said. \"So terribly young to have to die....\"\n\nShe looked at Johnny and at the little bottle that held his too-small\nmorning ration of milk.\n\n\"Johnny--Johnny----\" Her words were almost a whisper. \"You're\nhungry--but we can't let them die. And someday, for this, they will\nfight for your life.\"\n\nShe sat on the bed and placed the pups in her lap beside Johnny. She\nlifted a little black head with gentle fingers and a little pink mouth\nceased whimpering as it found the nipple of Johnny's bottle.\n\nJohnny's gray eyes darkened with the storm of approaching protest. Then\nthe other pup touched his hand, crying in its hunger, and the protest\nfaded as surprise and something like sudden understanding came into his\neyes.\n\nJulia withdrew the bottle from the first pup and transferred it to the\nsecond one. Its crying ceased and Johnny leaned forward to touch it\nagain, and the one beside it.\n\nHe made his decision with an approving sound and leaned back against his\nmother's shoulder, patiently awaiting his own turn and their presence\naccepted as though they had been born his brother and sister.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe golden light of the new day shone on them, on his daughter and\ngrandson and the prowler pups, and in it he saw the bright omen for the\nfuture.\n\nHis own role was nearing its end but he had seen the people of Ragnarok\nconquer their environment in so far as Big Winter would ever let it be\nconquered. The last generation was being born, the generation that would\nmeet the Gerns, and now they would have their final ally. Perhaps it\nwould be Johnny who led them on that day, as the omen seemed to\nprophesy.\n\nHe was the son of a line of leaders, born to a mother who had fought and\nkilled a unicorn. He had gone hungry to share what little he had with\nthe young of Ragnarok's most proud and savage species and Fenrir and\nSigyn would fight beside him on the day he led the forces of the\nhell-world in the battle with the Gerns who thought they were gods.\n\nCould the Gerns hope to have a leader to match?\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                 PART 4\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nJohn Humbolt, leader, stood on the wide stockade wall and watched the\nlowering sun touch the western horizon--far south of where it had set\nwhen he was a child. Big Summer was over and now, in the year two\nhundred, they were already three years into Big Fall. The Craigs had\nbeen impassable with snow for five years and the country at the north\nend of the plateau, where the iron had been found, had been buried under\nnever-melting snow and growing glaciers for twenty years.\n\nThere came the soft tinkling of ceramic bells as the herd of milk goats\ncame down off the hills. Two children were following and six prowlers\nwalked with them, to protect them from wild unicorns.\n\nThere were not many of the goats. Each year the winters were longer,\nrequiring the stocking of a larger supply of hay. The time would come\nwhen the summers would be so short and the winters so long that they\ncould not keep goats at all. And by then, when Big Winter had closed in\non them, the summer seasons would be too short for the growing of the\norange corn. They would have nothing left but the hunting.\n\nThey had, he knew, reached and passed the zenith of the development of\ntheir environment. From a low of forty-nine men, women and children in\ndark caves they had risen to a town of six thousand. For a few years\nthey had had a way of life that was almost a civilization but the\ninevitable decline was already under way. The years of frozen sterility\nof Big Winter were coming and no amount of determination or ingenuity\ncould alter them. Six thousand would have to live by hunting--and one\nhundred, in the first Big Winter, had found barely enough game.\n\nThey would have to migrate in one of two different ways: they could go\nto the south as nomad hunters--or they could go to other, fairer, worlds\nin ships they took from the Gerns.\n\nThe choice was very easy to make and they were almost ready.\n\nIn the workshop at the farther edge of town the hyperspace transmitter\nwas nearing completion. The little smelter was waiting to receive the\nlathe and other iron and steel and turn them into the castings for the\ngenerator. Their weapons were ready, the mockers were trained, the\nprowlers were waiting. And in the massive corral beyond town forty\nhalf-tame unicorns trampled the ground and hated the world, wanting to\nkill something. They had learned to be afraid of Ragnarok men but they\nwould not be afraid to kill Gerns....\n\nThe children with the goats reached the stockade and two of the\nprowlers, Fenrir and Sigyn, turned to see him standing on the wall. He\nmade a little motion with his hand and they came running, to leap up\nbeside him on the ten-foot-high wall.\n\n\"So you've been checking up on how well the young ones guard the\nchildren?\" he asked.\n\nSigyn lolled out her tongue and her white teeth grinned at him in\nanswer. Fenrir, always the grimmer of the two, made a sound in his\nthroat in reply.\n\nProwlers developed something like a telepathic rapport with their\nmasters and could sense their thoughts and understand relatively complex\ninstructions. Their intelligence was greater, and of a far more mature\norder, than that of the little mockers but their vocal cords were not\ncapable of making the sounds necessary for speech.\n\nHe rested his hands on their shoulders, where their ebony fur was\nfrosted with gray. Age had not yet affected their quick, flowing\nmovement but they were getting old--they were only a few weeks short of\nhis own age. He could not remember when they had not been with him....\n\nSometimes it seemed to him he could remember those hungry days when he\nand Fenrir and Sigyn shared together in his mother's lap--but it was\nprobably only his imagination from having heard the story told so often.\nBut he could remember for certain when he was learning to walk and\nFenrir and Sigyn, full grown then, walked tall and black beside him. He\ncould remember playing with Sigyn's pups and he could remember Sigyn\nwatching over them all, sometimes giving her pups a bath and his face a\nwashing with equal disregard for their and his protests. Above all he\ncould remember the times when he was almost grown; the wild, free days\nwhen he and Fenrir and Sigyn had roamed the mountains together. With a\nbow and a knife and two prowlers beside him he had felt that there was\nnothing on Ragnarok that they could not conquer; that there was nothing\nin the universe they could not defy together....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a flicker of black movement and a young messenger prowler came\nrunning from the direction of the council hall, a speckle-faced mocker\nclinging to its back. It leaped up on the wall beside him and the\nmocker, one that had been trained to remember and repeat messages\nverbatim, took a breath so deep that its cheeks bulged out. It spoke, in\na quick rush like a child that is afraid it might forget some of the\nwords:\n\n\"You will please come to the council hall to lead the discussion\nregarding the last preparations for the meeting with the Gerns. The\ntransmitter is completed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lathe was torn down the next day and the smelter began to roar with\nits forced draft. Excitement and anticipation ran through the town like\na fever. It would take perhaps twenty days to build the generator,\nworking day and night so that not an hour of time would be lost, forty\ndays for the signal to reach Athena, and forty days for the Gern cruiser\nto reach Ragnarok----\n\nIn one hundred days the Gerns would be there!\n\nThe men who would engage in the fight for the cruiser quit trimming\ntheir beards. Later, when it was time for the Gerns to appear, they\nwould discard their woolen garments for ones of goat skin. The Gerns\nwould regard them as primitive inferiors at best and it might be of\nadvantage to heighten the impression. It would make the awakening of the\nGerns a little more shocking.\n\nAn underground passage, leading from the town to the concealment of the\nwoods in the distance, had long ago been dug. Through it the women and\nchildren would go when the Gerns arrived.\n\nThere was a level area of ground, just beyond the south wall of town,\nwhere the cruiser would be almost certain to land. The town had been\nbuilt with that thought in mind. Woods were not far from both sides of\nthe landing site and unicorn corrals were hidden in them. From the\ncorrals would come the rear flanking attack against the Gerns.\n\nThe prowlers, of course, would be scattered among all the forces.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe generator was completed and installed on the nineteenth night.\nCharley Craig, a giant of a man whose red beard gave him a genially\nmurderous appearance, opened the valve of the water pipe. The new wooden\nturbine stirred and belts and pulleys began to spin. The generator\nhummed, the needles of the dials climbed, flickered, and steadied.\n\nNorman Lake looked from them to Humbolt, his pale gray eyes coldly\nsatisfied. \"Full output,\" he said. \"We have the power we need this\ntime.\"\n\nJim Chiara was at the transmitter and they waited while he threw\nswitches and studied dials. Every component of the transmitter had been\ntested but they had not had the power to test the complete assembly.\n\n\"That's it,\" he said at last, looking up at them. \"She's ready, after\nalmost two hundred years of wanting her.\"\n\nHumbolt wondered what the signal should be and saw no reason why it\nshould not be the same one that had been sent out with such hope a\nhundred and sixty-five years ago.\n\n\"All right, Jim,\" he said. \"Let the Gerns know we're waiting for\nthem--make it 'Ragnarok calling' again.\"\n\nThe transmitter key rattled and the all-wave signal that the Gerns\ncould not fail to receive went out at a velocity of five light-years a\nday:\n\n_Ragnarok calling--Ragnarok calling--Ragnarok calling--_\n\nIt was the longest summer Humbolt had ever experienced. He was not alone\nin his impatience--among all of them the restlessness flamed higher as\nthe slow days dragged by, making it almost impossible to go about their\nroutine duties. The gentle mockers sensed the anticipation of their\nmasters for the coming battle and they became nervous and apprehensive.\nThe prowlers sensed it and they paced about the town in the dark of\nnight; watching, listening, on ceaseless guard against the mysterious\nenemy their masters waited for. Even the unicorns seemed to sense what\nwas coming and they rumbled and squealed in their corrals at night,\nred-eyed with the lust for blood and sometimes attacking the log walls\nwith blows that shook the ground.\n\nThe interminable days went their slow succession and summer gave way to\nfall. The hundredth day dawned, cold and gray with the approach of\nwinter; the day of the Gerns.\n\nBut no cruiser came that day, nor the next. He stood again on the\nstockade wall in the evening of the third day, Fenrir and Sigyn beside\nhim. He listened for the first dim, distant sound of the Gern cruiser\nand heard only the moaning of the wind around him.\n\nWinter was coming. Always, on Ragnarok, winter was coming or the brown\ndeath of summer. Ragnarok was a harsh and barren prison, and no amount\nof desire could ever make it otherwise. Only the coming of a Gern\ncruiser could ever offer them the bloody, violent opportunity to regain\ntheir freedom.\n\nBut what if the cruiser never came?\n\nIt was a thought too dark and hopeless to be held. They were not asking\na large favor of fate, after two hundred years of striving for it; only\nthe chance to challenge the Gern Empire with bows and knives....\n\nFenrir stiffened, the fur lifting on his shoulders and a muted growl\ncoming from him. Then Humbolt heard the first whisper of sound; a faint,\nfaraway roaring that was not the wind.\n\nHe watched and listened and the sound came swiftly nearer, rising in\npitch and swelling in volume. Then it broke through the clouds, tall and\nblack and beautifully deadly. It rode down on its rockets of flame,\nfilling the valley with its thunder, and his heart hammered with\nexultation.\n\nIt had come--the cruiser had come!\n\nHe turned and dropped the ten feet to the ground inside the stockade.\nThe warning signal was being sounded from the center of town; a unicorn\nhorn that gave out the call they had used in the practice alarms.\nAlready the women and children would be hurrying along the tunnels that\nled to the temporary safety of the woods beyond town. The Gerns might\nuse their turret blasters to destroy the town and all in it before the\nnight was over. There was no way of knowing what might happen before it\nended. But whatever it was, it would be the action they had all been\nwanting.\n\nHe ran to where the others would be gathering, Fenrir and Sigyn loping\nbeside him and the horn ringing wild and savage and triumphant as it\nannounced the end of two centuries of waiting.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cruiser settled to earth in the area where it had been expected to\nland, towering high above the town with its turret blasters looking down\nupon the houses.\n\nCharley Craig and Norman Lake were waiting for him on the high steps of\nhis own house in the center of town where the elevation gave them a good\nview of the ship yet where the fringes of the canopy would conceal them\nfrom the ship's scanners. They were heavily armed, their prowlers beside\nthem and their mockers on their shoulders.\n\nElsewhere, under the connected rows of concealing canopies, armed men\nwere hurrying to their prearranged stations. Most of them were\naccompanied by prowlers, bristling and snarling as they looked at the\nalien ship. A few men were deliberately making themselves visible not\nfar away, going about unimportant tasks with only occasional and\ncarefully disinterested glances toward the ship. They were the bait, to\nlure the first detachment into the center of town....\n\n\"Well?\" Norman Lake asked, his pale eyes restless with his hunger for\nviolence. \"There's our ship--when do we take her?\"\n\n\"Just as soon as we get them outside it,\" he said. \"We'll use the plan\nwe first had--wait until they send a full force to rescue the first\ndetachment and then hit them with everything we have.\"\n\nHis black, white-nosed mocker was standing in the open doorway and\nwatching the hurrying men and prowlers with worried interest: Tip, the\ngreat-great-great-great grandson of the mocker that had died with Howard\nLake north of the plateau. He reached down to pick him up and set him on\nhis shoulder, and said:\n\n\"Jim?\"\n\n\"The longbows are ready,\" Tip's treble imitation of Jim Chiara's voice\nanswered. \"We'll black out their searchlights when the time comes.\"\n\n\"Andy?\" he asked.\n\n\"The last of us for this section are coming in now,\" Andy Taylor\nanswered.\n\nHe made his check of all the subleaders, then looked up to the roof to\nask, \"All set, Jimmy?\"\n\nJimmy Stevens' grinning face appeared over the edge. \"Ten crossbows are\ncocked and waiting up here. Bring us our targets.\"\n\nThey waited, while the evening deepened into near-dusk. Then the airlock\nof the cruiser slid open and thirteen Gerns emerged, the one leading\nthem wearing the resplendent uniform of a subcommander.\n\n\"There they come,\" he said to Lake and Craig. \"It looks like we'll be\nable to trap them in here and force the commander to send out a\nfull-sized force. We'll all attack at the sound of the horn and if you\ncan hit their rear flanks hard enough with the unicorns to give us a\nchance to split them from this end some of us should make it to the ship\nbefore they realize up in the control room that they should close the\nairlocks.\n\n\"Now\"--he looked at the Gerns who were coming straight toward the\nstockade wall, ignoring the gate to their right--\"you'd better be on\nyour way. We'll meet again before long in the ship.\"\n\nFenrir and Sigyn looked from the advancing Gerns to him with question in\ntheir eyes after Lake and Craig were gone, Fenrir growling restlessly.\n\n\"Pretty soon,\" he said to them. \"Right now it would be better if they\ndidn't see you. Wait inside, both of you.\" They went reluctantly inside,\nto merge with the darkness of the interior. Only an occasional yellow\ngleam of their eyes showed that they were crouched to spring just inside\nthe doorway.\n\nHe called to the nearest unarmed man, not loud enough to be heard by the\nGerns:\n\n\"Cliff--you and Sam Anders come here. Tell the rest to fade out of sight\nand get armed.\"\n\nCliff Schroeder passed the command along and he and Sam Anders\napproached. He looked back at the Gerns and saw they were within a\nhundred feet of the--for them--unscalable wall of the stockade. They\nwere coming without hesitation----\n\nA pale blue beam lashed down from one of the cruiser's turrets and a\nfifty foot section of the wall erupted into dust with a sound like\nthunder. The wind swept the dust aside in a gigantic cloud and the Gerns\ncame through the gap, looking neither to right nor left.\n\n\"That, I suppose,\" Sam Anders said from beside him, \"was Lesson Number\nOne for degenerate savages like us: Gerns, like gods, are not to be\nhindered by man-made barriers.\"\n\nThe Gerns walked with a peculiar gait that puzzled him until he saw what\nit was. They were trying to come with the arrogant military stride\naffected by the Gerns and in the 1.5 gravity they were succeeding in\nachieving only a heavy clumping.\n\nThey advanced steadily and as they drew closer he saw that in the right\nhand of each Gern soldier was a blaster while in the left hand of each\ncould be seen the metallic glitter of chains.\n\nSchroeder smiled thinly. \"It looks like they want to subject about a\ndozen of us to some painful questioning.\"\n\nNo one else was any longer in sight and the Gerns came straight toward\nthe three on the steps. They stopped forty feet away at a word of\ncommand from the officer and Gerns and Ragnarok men exchanged silent\nstares; the faces of the Ragnarok men bearded and expressionless, the\nfaces of the Gerns hairless and reflecting a contemptuous curiosity.\n\n\"Narth!\" The communicator on the Gern officer's belt spoke with metallic\nauthority. \"What do they look like? Did we come two hundred light-years\nto view some animated vegetables?\"\n\n\"No, Commander,\" Narth answered. \"I think the discard of the Rejects two\nhundred years ago has produced for us an unexpected reward. There are\nthree natives under the canopy before me and their physical perfection\nand complete adaptation to this hellish gravity is astonishing.\"\n\n\"They could be used to replace expensive machines on some of the outer\nworld mines,\" the commander said, \"providing their intelligence isn't\ntoo abysmally low. What about that?\"\n\n\"They can surely be taught to perform simple manual labor,\" Narth\nanswered.\n\n\"Get on with your job,\" the commander said. \"Try to pick some of the\nmost intelligent looking ones for questioning--I can't believe these\ncattle sent that message and they're going to tell us who did. And pick\nsome young, strong ones for the medical staff to examine--ones that\nwon't curl up and die after the first few cuts of the knife.\"\n\n\"We'll chain these three first,\" Narth said. He lifted his hand in an\nimperious gesture to Humbolt and the other two and ordered in accented\nTerran: \"Come here!\"\n\nNo one moved and he said again, sharply, _\"Come here!\"_\n\nAgain no one moved and the minor officer beside Narth said, \"Apparently\nthey can't even understand Terran now.\"\n\n\"Then we'll give them some action they can understand,\" Narth snapped,\nhis face flushing with irritation. \"We'll drag them out by their heels!\"\n\nThe Gerns advanced purposefully, three of them holstering their blasters\nto make their chains ready. When they had passed under the canopy and\ncould not be seen from the ship Humbolt spoke:\n\n\"All right, Jimmy.\"\n\nThe Gerns froze in midstride, suspicion flashing across their faces.\n\n\"Look up on the roof,\" he said in Gern.\n\nThey looked, and the suspicion became gaping dismay.\n\n\"You can be our prisoners or you can be corpses,\" he said. \"We don't\ncare which.\"\n\nThe urgent hiss of Narth's command broke their indecision:\n\n_\"Kill them!\"_\n\nSix of them tried to obey, bringing up their blasters in movements that\nseemed curiously heavy and slow, as though the gravity of Ragnarok had\nturned their arms to wood. Three of them almost lifted their blasters\nhigh enough to fire at the steps in front of them before arrows went\nthrough their throats. The other three did not get that far.\n\nNarth and the remaining six went rigidly motionless and he said to them:\n\n\"Drop your blasters--quick!\"\n\nTheir blasters thumped to the ground and Jimmy Stevens and his bowmen\nslid off the roof. Within a minute the Gerns were bound with their own\nchains, but for the officer, and the blasters were in the hands of the\nRagnarok men.\n\nJimmy looked down the row of Gerns and shook his head. \"So these are\nGerns?\" he said. \"It was like trapping a band of woods goats.\"\n\n\"Young ones,\" Schroeder amended. \"And almost as dangerous.\"\n\nNarth's face flushed at the words and his eyes went to the ship. The\nsight of it seemed to restore his courage and his lips drew back in a\nsnarl.\n\n\"You fools--you stupid, megalomaniac dung-heaps--do you think you can\nkill Gerns and live to boast about it?\"\n\n\"Keep quiet,\" Humbolt ordered, studying him with curiosity. Narth, like\nall the Gerns, was different from what they had expected. It was true\nthe Gerns had strode into their town with an attempt at arrogance but\nthey were harmless in appearance, soft of face and belly, and the\nsnarling of the red-faced Narth was like the bluster of a cornered\nscavenger-rodent.\n\n\"I promise you this,\" Narth was saying viciously, \"if you don't release\nus and return our weapons this instant I'll personally oversee the\nextermination of you and every savage in this village with the most\npainful death science can contrive and I'll----\"\n\nHumbolt reached out his hand and flicked Narth under the chin. Narth's\nteeth cracked loudly together and his face twisted with the pain of a\nbitten tongue.\n\n\"Tie him up, Jess,\" he said to a man near him. \"If he opens his mouth\nagain, shove your foot in it.\"\n\nHe spoke to Schroeder. \"We'll keep three of the blasters and send two to\neach of the other front groups. Have that done.\"\n\nDusk was deepening into darkness and he called Chiara again. \"They'll\nturn on their searchlights any minute and make the town as light as\nday,\" he said. \"If you can keep them blacked out until some of us have\nreached the ship, I think we'll have won.\"\n\n\"They'll be kept blacked out,\" Chiara said. \"With some flint-headed\narrows left over for the Gerns.\"\n\nHe called Lake and Craig, to be told they were ready and waiting.\n\n\"But we're having hell keeping the unicorns quiet,\" Craig said. \"They\nwant to get to killing something.\"\n\nHe pressed the switch of the communicator but it was dead. They had, of\ncourse, transferred to some other wave length so he could not hear the\ncommands. It was something he had already anticipated....\n\nFenrir and Sigyn were still obediently inside the doorway, almost\nfrantic with desire to rejoin him. He spoke to them and they bounded\nout, snarling at three Gerns in passing and causing them to blanch to a\ndead-white color.\n\nHe set Tip on Sigyn's shoulders and said, \"Sigyn, there's a job for you\nand Tip to do. A dangerous job. Listen--both of you....\"\n\nThe yellow eyes of Sigyn and the dark eyes of the little mocker looked\ninto his as he spoke to them and accompanied his words with the\nstrongest, clearest mental images he could project:\n\n\"Sigyn, take Tip to the not-men thing. Leave him hidden in the grass to\none side of the big hole in it. Tip, you wait there. When the not-men\ncome out you listen, and tell what they say.\n\n\"Now, do you both understand?\"\n\nSigyn made a sound that meant she did but Tip clutched at his wrist with\nlittle paws suddenly gone cold and wailed, \"_No!_ Scared--scared----\"\n\n\"You have to go, Tip,\" he said, gently disengaging his wrist. \"And Sigyn\nwill hide near to you and watch over you.\" He spoke to Sigyn. \"When the\nhorn calls you run back with him.\"\n\nAgain she made the sound signifying understanding and he touched them\nboth in what he hoped would not be the last farewell.\n\n\"All right, Sigyn--go now.\"\n\nShe vanished into the gloom of coming night, Tip hanging tightly to her.\nFenrir stood with the fur lifted on his shoulders and a half snarl on\nhis face as he watched her go and watched the place where the not-men\nwould appear.\n\n\"Where's Freckles?\" he asked Jimmy.\n\n\"Here,\" someone said, and came forward with Tip's mate.\n\nHe set Freckles on his shoulder and the first searchlight came on,\nshining down from high up on the cruiser. It lighted up the area around\nthem in harsh white brilliance, its reflection revealing the black\nshadow that was Sigyn just vanishing behind the ship.\n\nTwo more searchlights came on, to illuminate the town. Then the Gerns\ncame.\n\nThey poured out through the airlock and down the ramp, there to form in\ncolumns that marched forward as still more Gerns hurried down the ramp\nbehind them. The searchlights gleamed on their battle helmets and on the\nblades of the bayonets affixed to their rifle-like long range blasters.\nHand blasters and grenades hung from their belts, together with stubby\nflame guns.\n\nThey were a solid mass reaching halfway to the stockade before the last\nof them, the commanding officers, appeared. One of them stopped at the\nfoot of the ramp to watch the advance of the punitive force and give the\nfrightened but faithful Tip the first words to transmit to Freckles:\n\n\"The full force is on its way, Commander.\"\n\nA reply came, in Freckles' simulation of the metallic tones of a\ncommunicator:\n\n\"The key numbers of the confiscated blasters have been checked and the\ndisturbance rays of the master integrator set. You'll probably have few\nnatives left alive to take as prisoners after those thirteen charges\nexplode but continue with a mopping up job that the survivors will never\nforget.\"\n\n_So the Gerns could, by remote control, set the total charges of stolen\nblasters to explode upon touching the firing stud?_ It was something new\nsince the days of the Old Ones....\n\nHe called Chiara and the other groups, quickly, to tell them what he had\nlearned. \"We'll get more blasters--ones they can't know the numbers\nof--when we attack,\" he finished.\n\nHe took the blaster from his belt and laid it on the ground. The front\nranks of the Gerns were almost to the wall by then, a column wider than\nthe gap that had been blasted through it, coming with silent\npurposefulness.\n\nTwo blaster beams lanced down from the turrets, to smash at the wall.\nDust billowed and thunder rumbled as they swept along. A full three\nhundred feet of the wall had been destroyed when they stopped and the\ndust hid the ship and made dim glows of the searchlights.\n\nIt had no doubt been intended to impress them with the might of the\nGerns but in doing so it hid the Ragnarok forces from the advancing\nGerns for a few seconds.\n\n\"Jim--black out their lights before the dust clears,\" he called.\n\"Joe--the horn! We attack now!\"\n\nThe first longbow arrow struck a searchlight and its glow grew dimmer as\nthe arrow's burden--a thin tube of thick lance tree ink--splattered\nagainst it. Another followed----\n\nThen the horn rang out, harsh and commanding, and in the distance a\nunicorn screamed in answer. The savage cry of a prowler came, like a\nsound to match, and the attack was on.\n\nHe ran with Fenrir beside him and to his left and right ran the others\nwith their prowlers. The lead groups converged as they went through the\nwide gap in the wall. They ran on, into the dust cloud, and the shadowy\nforms of the Gerns were suddenly before them.\n\nA blaster beam cut into them and a Gern shouted, _\"The natives!\"_ Other\nbeams sprang into life, winking like pale blue eyes through the dust and\nkilling all they touched. The beams dropped as the first volley of\narrows tore through the massed front ranks, to be replaced by others.\n\nThey charged on, into the blue winking of the blasters and the red\nlances of the flame guns with the crossbows rattling and strumming in\nanswer. The prowlers lunged and fought beside them and ahead of them;\nblack hell-creatures that struck the Gerns too swiftly for blasters to\nfind before throats were torn out; the sound of battle turned into a\nconfusion of raging snarls, frantic shouts and dying screams.\n\nA prowler shot past him to join Fenrir--Sigyn--and he felt Tip dart up\nto his shoulder. She made a sound of greeting in passing, a sound that\nwas gone as her jaws closed on a Gern.\n\nThe dust cloud cleared a little and the searchlights looked down on the\nscene; no longer brilliantly white but shining through the red-black\nlance tree ink as a blood red glow. A searchlight turret slid shut and\nopened a moment later, the light wiped clean. The longbows immediately\ntransformed it into a red glow.\n\nThe beam of one of the turret blasters stabbed down, to blaze a trail of\ndeath through the battle. It ceased as its own light revealed to the\nGern commander that the Ragnarok forces were so intermixed with the Gern\nforces that he was killing more Gerns than Ragnarok men.\n\nBy then the fighting was so hand to hand that knives were better than\ncrossbows. The Gerns fell like harvested corn; too slow and awkward to\nuse their bayonets against the faster Ragnarok men and killing as many\nof one another as men when they tried to use their blasters and flame\nguns. From the rear there came the command of a Gern officer, shouted\nhigh and thin above the sound of battle:\n\n\"Back to the ship--leave the natives for the ship's blasters to kill!\"\n\nThe unicorns arrived then, to cut off their retreat.\n\nThey came twenty from the east and twenty from the west in a thunder of\nhooves, squealing and screaming in their blood lust, with prowlers a\nblack wave going before them. They struck the Gerns; the prowlers\nslashing lanes through them while the unicorns charged behind, trampling\nthem, ripping into them with their horns and smashing them down with\ntheir hooves as they vented the pent up rage of their years of\nconfinement. On the back of each was a rider whose long spear flicked\nand stabbed into the throats and bellies of Gerns.\n\nThe retreat was halted and transformed into milling confusion. He led\nhis own groups in the final charge, the prearranged wedge attack, and\nthey split the Gern force in two.\n\nThe ship was suddenly just beyond them.\n\nHe gave the last command to Lake and Craig: \"_Now_--into the ship!\"\n\nHe scooped up a blaster from beside a fallen Gern and ran toward it. A\nGern officer was already in the airlock, his face pale and strained as\nhe looked back and his hand on the closing switch. He shot him and ran\nup the ramp as the officer's body rolled down it.\n\nUnicorn hooves pounded behind him and twenty of them swept past, their\nriders leaping from their backs to the ramp. Twenty men and fifteen\nprowlers charged up the ramp as a warning siren shrieked somewhere\ninside the ship. At the same time the airlocks, operated from the\ncontrol room, began to slide swiftly shut.\n\nHe was through first, with Fenrir and Sigyn. Lake and Craig, together\nwith six men and four prowlers, squeezed through barely in time. Then\nthe airlocks were closed and they were sealed in the ship.\n\nAlarm bells added their sound to the shrieking of the siren and from the\nmultiple-compartments shafts came the whir of elevators dropping with\nGern forces to kill the humans trapped inside the ship.\n\nThey ran past the elevator shafts without pausing, light and swift in\nthe artificial gravity that was only two-thirds that of Ragnarok. They\nsplit forces as long ago planned; three men and four prowlers going with\nCharley Craig in the attempt to take the drive room, Lake and the other\nthree men going with him in the attempt to take the control room.\n\nThey found the manway ladder and began to climb, Fenrir and Sigyn\nimpatiently crowding their heels.\n\nThere was nothing on the control room level and they ran down the short\ncorridor that their maps had showed. They turned left, into the corridor\nthat had the control room at its end, and into the concentrated fire of\nnine waiting Gerns.\n\nFenrir and Sigyn went into the Gerns, under their fire before they could\ndrop the muzzles of their blasters, with an attack so vicious and\nunexpected that what would have been a certain and lethal trap for the\nhumans was suddenly a fighting chance.\n\nThe corridor became an inferno of blaster beams that cracked and hissed\nas they met and crossed, throwing little chips of metal from the walls\nwith snapping sounds and going through flesh with sounds like soft\ntappings. It was over within seconds, the last Gern down and one man\nstill standing beside him, the blond and nerveless Lake.\n\nThomsen and Barber were dead and Billy West was bracing himself against\nthe wall with a blaster hole through his stomach, trying to say\nsomething and sliding to the floor before it was ever spoken.\n\nAnd Sigyn was down, blood welling and bubbling from a wound in her\nchest, while Fenrir stood over her with his snarling a raging scream as\nhe swung his head in search of a still-living Gern.\n\nHumbolt and Lake ran on, Fenrir raging beside them, and into the control\nroom.\n\nSix officers, one wearing the uniform of a commander, were gaping in\nastonishment and bringing up their blasters in the way that seemed so\ncuriously slow to Humbolt. Fenrir, in his fury, killed two of them as\nLake's blaster and his own killed three more.\n\nThe commander was suddenly alone, his blaster half lifted. Fenrir leaped\nat his throat and Humbolt shouted the quick command: _\"Disarm!\"_\n\nIt was something the prowlers had been taught in their training and\nFenrir's teeth clicked short of the commander's throat while his paw\nsent the blaster spinning across the room.\n\nThe commander stared at them with his swarthy face a dark gray and his\nmouth still gaping.\n\n\"How--how did you do it?\" he asked in heavily accented Terran. \"Only two\nof you----\"\n\n\"Don't talk until you're asked a question,\" Lake said.\n\n\"Only two of you....\" The thought seemed to restore his courage, as\nsight of the ship had restored Narth's that night, and his tone became\nthreatening. \"There are only two of you and more guards will be here to\nkill you within a minute. Surrender to me and I'll let you go free----\"\n\nLake slapped him across the mouth with a backhanded blow that snapped\nhis head back on his shoulders and split his lip.\n\n\"Don't talk,\" he ordered again. \"And never lie to us.\"\n\nThe commander spit out a tooth and held his hand to his bleeding mouth.\nHe did not speak again.\n\nTip and Freckles were holding tightly to his shoulder and each other,\nthe racing of their hearts like a vibration, and he touched them\nreassuringly.\n\n\"All right now--all safe now,\" he said.\n\nHe called Charley Craig. \"Charley--did you make it?\"\n\n\"We made it to the drive room--two of us and one prowler,\" Charley\nanswered. \"What about you?\"\n\n\"Norman and I have the control room. Cut their drives, to play safe.\nI'll let you know as soon as the entire ship is ours.\"\n\nHe went to the viewscreen and saw that the battle was over. Chiara was\nletting the searchlight burn again and prowlers were being used to drive\nback the unicorns from the surrendering Gerns.\n\n\"I guess we won,\" he said to Lake.\n\nBut there was no feeling of victory, none of the elation he had thought\nhe would have. Sigyn was dying alone in the alien corridor outside.\nSigyn, who had nursed beside him and fought beside him and laid down her\nlife for him....\n\n\"I want to look at her,\" he said to Lake.\n\nFenrir went with him. She was still alive, waiting for them to come back\nto her. She lifted her head and touched his hand with her tongue as he\nexamined the wound.\n\nIt was not fatal--it need not be fatal. He worked swiftly, gently, to\nstop the bleeding that had been draining her life away. She would have\nto lie quietly for weeks but she would recover.\n\nWhen he was done he pressed her head back to the floor and said, \"Lie\nstill, Sigyn girl, until we can come to move you. Wait for us and Fenrir\nwill stay here with you.\"\n\nShe obeyed and he left them, the feeling of victory and elation coming\nto him in full then.\n\nLake looked at him questioningly as he entered the control room and he\nsaid, \"She'll live.\"\n\nHe turned to the Gern commander. \"First, I want to know how the war is\ngoing?\"\n\n\"I----\" The commander looked uncertainly at Lake.\n\n\"Just tell the truth,\" Lake said. \"Whether you think we'll like it or\nnot.\"\n\n\"We have all the planets but Earth, itself,\" the commander said. \"We'll\nhave it, soon.\"\n\n\"And the Terrans on Athena?\"\n\n\"They're still--working for us there.\"\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"you will order every Gern in this ship to go to his\nsleeping quarters. They will leave their weapons in the corridors\noutside and they will not resist the men who will come to take charge of\nthe ship.\"\n\nThe commander made an effort toward defiance:\n\n_\"And if I refuse?\"_\n\nLake answered, smiling at him with the smile of his that was no more\nthan a quick showing of teeth and with the savage eagerness in his eyes.\n\n\"If you refuse I'll start with your fingers and break every bone to\nyour shoulders. If that isn't enough I'll start with your toes and go to\nyour hips. And then I'll break your back.\"\n\nThe commander hesitated, sweat filming his face as he looked at them.\nThen he reached out to switch on the all-stations communicator and say\ninto it:\n\n\"Attention, all personnel: You will return to your quarters at once,\nleaving your weapons in the corridors. You are ordered to make no\nresistance when the natives come....\"\n\nThere was a silence when he had finished and Humbolt and Lake looked at\neach other, bearded and clad in animal skins but standing at last in the\ncontrol room of a ship that was theirs: in a ship that could take them\nto Athena, to Earth, to the ends of the galaxy.\n\nThe commander watched them, on his face the blankness of unwillingness\nto believe.\n\n\"The airlocks--\" he said. \"We didn't close them in time. We never\nthought you would dare try to take the ship--not savages in animal\nskins.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Humbolt answered. \"We were counting on you to think that way.\"\n\n\"No one expected any of you to survive here.\" The commander wiped at his\nswollen lips, wincing, and an almost child-like petulance came into his\ntone. \"You weren't supposed to survive.\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said again. \"We've made it a point to remember that.\"\n\n\"The gravity, the heat and cold and fever, the animals--why didn't they\nkill you?\"\n\n\"They tried,\" he said. \"But we fought back. And we had a goal--to meet\nyou Gerns again. You left us on a world that had no resources. Only\nenemies who would kill us--the gravity, the prowlers, the unicorns. So\nwe made them our resources. We adapted to the gravity that was supposed\nto kill us and became stronger and quicker than Gerns. We made allies of\nthe prowlers and unicorns who were supposed to be our executioners and\nused them tonight to help us kill Gerns. So now we have your ship.\"\n\n\"Yes ... you have our ship.\" Through the unwillingness to believe on the\ncommander's face and the petulance there came the triumph of vindictive\nanticipation. \"The savages of Ragnarok have a Gern cruiser--but what can\nthey do with it?\"\n\n\"What can we do with it?\" he asked, almost kindly. \"We've planned for\ntwo hundred years what we can do with it. We have the cruiser and sixty\ndays from now we'll have Athena. That will be only the beginning and you\nGerns are going to help us do it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor six days the ship was a scene of ceaseless activity. Men crowded it,\nasking questions of the Gern officers and crew and calmly breaking the\nbones of those who refused to answer or who gave answers that were not\ntrue. Prowlers stalked the corridors, their cold yellow eyes watching\nevery move the Gerns made. The little mockers began roaming the ship at\nwill, unable any longer to restrain their curiosity and confident that\nthe men and prowlers would not let the Gerns harm them.\n\nOne mocker was killed then; the speckle-faced mocker that could repeat\nmessages verbatim. It wandered into a storage cubicle where a Gern was\nworking alone and gave him the opportunity to safely vent his hatred of\neverything associated with the men of Ragnarok. He broke its back with a\nsteel bar and threw it, screaming, into the disposal chute that led to\nthe matter converter. A prowler heard the scream and an instant later\nthe Gern screamed; a sound that died in its making as the prowler tore\nhis throat out. No more mockers were harmed.\n\nOne Ragnarok boy was killed. Three fanatical Gern officers stole knives\nfrom the galley and held the boy as hostage for their freedom. When\ntheir demands were refused they cut his heart out. Lake cornered them a\nfew minutes later and, without touching his blaster, disemboweled them\nwith their own knives. He smiled down upon them as they writhed and\nmoaned on the floor and their moans were heard for a long time by the\nother Gerns in the ship before they died. No more humans were harmed.\n\nThey discovered that operation of the cruiser was relatively simple,\nbasically similar to the operation of Terran ships as described in the\ntext book the original Lake had written. Most of the operations were\nperformed by robot mechanisms and the manual operations, geared to the\nslower reflexes of the Gerns, were easily mastered.\n\nThey could spend the forty-day voyage to Athena in further learning and\npractice so on the sixth day they prepared to depart. The unicorns had\nbeen given the freedom they had fought so well for and reconnaissance\nvehicles were loaned from the cruiser to take their place. Later there\nwould be machinery and supplies of all kinds brought in by freighter\nships from Athena.\n\nTime was precious and there was a long, long job ahead of them. They\nblasted up from Ragnarok on the morning of the seventh day and went into\nthe black sea of hyperspace.\n\nBy then the Gern commander was no longer of any value to them. His\nunwillingness to believe that savages had wrested his ship from him had\nincreased until his compartment became his control room to him and he\nspent the hours laughing and giggling before an imaginary viewscreen\nwhereon the cruiser's blasters were destroying, over and over, the\nRagnarok town and all the humans in it.\n\nBut Narth, who had wanted to have them tortured to death for daring to\nresist capture, became very cooperative. In the control room his\ncooperation was especially eager. On the twentieth day of the voyage\nthey let him have what he had been trying to gain by subterfuge: access\nto the transmitter when no men were within hearing distance.\n\nAfter that his manner abruptly changed. Each day his hatred for them and\nhis secret anticipation became more evident.\n\nThe thirty-fifth day came, with Athena five days ahead of them--the day\nof the execution they had let him arrange for them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStars filled the transdimensional viewscreen, the sun of Athena in the\ncenter. Humbolt watched the space to the lower left and the flicker came\nagain; a tiny red dot that was gone again within a microsecond, so\nquickly that Narth in the seat beside him did not see it.\n\nIt was the quick peek of another ship; a ship that was running invisible\nwith its detector screens up but which had had to drop them for an\ninstant to look out at the cruiser. Not even the Gerns had ever been\nable to devise a polarized detector screen.\n\nHe changed the course and speed of the cruiser, creating an increase in\ngravity which seemed very slight to him but which caused Narth to slew\nheavily in his seat. Narth straightened and he said to him:\n\n\"Within a few minutes we'll engage the ship you sent for.\"\n\nNarth's jaw dropped, then came back up. \"So you spied on me?\"\n\n\"One of our Ragnarok allies did--the little animal that was sitting near\nthe transmitter. They're our means of communication. We learned that you\nhad arranged for a ship, en route to Athena, to intercept us and capture\nus.\"\n\n\"So you know?\" Narth asked. He smiled, an unpleasant twisting of his\nmouth. \"Do you think that knowing will help you any?\"\n\n\"We expect it to,\" he answered.\n\n\"It's a battleship,\" Narth said. \"It's three times the size of this\ncruiser, the newest and most powerful battleship in the Gern fleet. How\ndoes that sound to you?\"\n\n\"It sounds good,\" he said. \"We'll make it our flagship.\"\n\n\"Your flagship--your _'flagship'_!\" The last trace of pretense left\nNarth and he let his full and rankling hatred come through. \"You got\nthis cruiser by trickery and learned how to operate it after a fashion\nbecause of an animal-like reflex abnormality. For forty-two days you\naccidental mutants have given orders to your superiors and thought you\nwere our equals. Now, your fool's paradise is going to end.\"\n\nThe red dot came again, closer, and he once more altered the ship's\ncourse. He had turned on the course analyzer and it clicked as the\nbattleship's position was correlated with that of its previous\nappearance. A short yellow line appeared on the screen to forecast its\ncourse for the immediate future.\n\n\"And then?\" he asked curiously, turning back to Narth.\n\n\"And then we'll take all of you left alive back to your village. The\nscenes of what we do to you and your village will be televised to all\nGern-held worlds. It will be a valuable reminder for any who have\nforgotten the penalty for resisting Gerns.\"\n\nThe red dot came again. He punched the BATTLE STATIONS button and the\nboard responded with a row of READY lights.\n\n\"All the other Gerns are by now in their acceleration couches,\" he said.\n\"Strap yourself in for high acceleration maneuvers--we'll make contact\nwith the battleship within two minutes.\"\n\nNarth did so, taking his time as though it was something of little\nimportance. \"There will be no maneuvers. They'll blast the stern and\ndestroy your drive immediately upon attack.\"\n\nHe fastened the last strap and smiled, taunting assurance in the twisted\nunpleasantness of it. \"The appearance of this battleship has very much\ndisrupted your plans to strut like conquering heroes among the slaves on\nAthena, hasn't it?\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Humbolt replied. \"Our plans are a little broader in scope\nthan that. There are two new cruisers on Athena, ready to leave the\nshops ten days from now. We'll turn control of Athena over to the humans\nthere, of course, then we'll take the three cruisers and the battleship\nback by way of Ragnarok. There we'll pick up all the Ragnarok men who\nare neither too old nor too young and go on to Earth. They will be given\ntraining en route in the handling of ships. We expect to find no\ndifficulty in breaking through the Gern lines around Earth and then,\nwith the addition of the Earth ships, we can easily capture all the Gern\nships in the solar system.\"\n\n\"'Easily'!\" Narth made a contemptuous sneer of the word. \"Were you\nactually so stupid as to think that you biological freaks could equal\nGern officers who have made a career of space warfare?\"\n\n\"We'll far exceed them,\" he said. \"A space battle is one of trying to\nkeep your blaster beams long enough on one area of the enemy ship to\nbreak through its blaster shields at that point. And at the same time\ntry to move and dodge fast enough to keep the enemy from doing the same\nthing to you. The ships are capable of accelerations up to fifty\ngravities or more but the acceleration limitator is the safeguard that\nprevents the ship from going into such a high degree of acceleration or\ninto such a sudden change of direction that it would kill the crew.\n\n\"We from Ragnarok are accustomed to a one point five gravity and can\nwithstand much higher degrees of acceleration than Gerns or any other\nrace from a one gravity world. To enable us to take advantage of that\nfact we have had the acceleration limitator on this cruiser\ndisconnected.\"\n\n_\"Disconnected?\"_ Narth's contemptuous regard vanished in frantic\nconsternation. \"You fool--you don't know what that means--_you'll move\nthe acceleration lever too far and kill us all!_\"\n\nThe red dot flicked on the viewscreen, trembled, and was suddenly a\ngigantic battleship in full view. He touched the acceleration control\nand Narth's next words were cut off as his diaphragm sagged. He swung\nthe cruiser in a curve and Narth was slammed sideways, the straps\ncutting into him and the flesh of his face pulled lopsided by the\ngravity. His eyes, bulging, went blank with unconsciousness.\n\nThe powerful blasters of the battleship blossomed like a row of pale\nblue flowers, concentrating on the stern of the cruiser. A warning siren\nscreeched as they started breaking through the cruiser's shields. He\ndropped the detector screen that would shield the cruiser from sight,\nbut not from the blaster beams, and tightened the curve until the\ngravity dragged heavily at his own body.\n\nThe warning siren stopped as the blaster beams of the battleship went\nharmlessly into space, continuing to follow the probability course\nplotted from the cruiser's last visible position and course by the\nbattleship's robot target tracers.\n\nHe lifted the detector screen, to find the battleship almost exactly\nwhere the cruiser's course analyzers had predicted it would be. The\nblasters of the battleship were blazing their full concentration of\nfirepower into an area behind and to one side of the cruiser.\n\nThey blinked out at sight of the cruiser in its new position and blazed\nagain a moment later, boring into the stern. He dropped the detector\nscreen and swung the cruiser in another curve, spiraling in the opposite\ndirection. As before, the screech of the alarm siren died as the\nbattleship's blasters followed the course given them by course analyzers\nand target tracers that were built to presume that all enemy ships were\nacceleration-limitator equipped.\n\nThe cruiser could have destroyed the battleship at any time--but they\nwanted to capture their flagship unharmed. The maneuvering continued,\nthe cruiser drawing closer to the battleship. The battleship, in\ndesperation, began using the same hide-and-jump tactics the cruiser used\nbut it was of little avail--the battleship moved at known acceleration\nlimits and the cruiser's course analyzers predicted each new position\nwith sufficient accuracy.\n\nThe cruiser made its final dash in a tightening spiral, its detector\nscreen flickering on and off. It struck the battleship at a matched\nspeed, with a thump and ringing of metal as the magnetic grapples\nfastened the cruiser like a leech to the battleship's side.\n\nIn that position neither the forward nor stern blasters of the\nbattleship could touch it. There remained only to convince the commander\nof the battleship that further resistance was futile.\n\nThis he did with a simple ultimatum to the commander:\n\n\"This cruiser is firmly attached to your ship, its acceleration\nlimitator disconnected. Its drives are of sufficient power to thrust\nboth ships forward at a much higher degree of acceleration than persons\nfrom one-gravity worlds can endure. You will surrender at once or we\nshall be forced to put these two ships into a curve of such short radius\nand at an acceleration so great that all of you will be killed.\"\n\nThen he added, \"If you surrender we'll do somewhat better by you than\nyou did with the humans two hundred years ago--we'll take all of you on\nto Athena.\"\n\nThe commander, already sick from an acceleration that would have been\nnegligible to Ragnarok men, had no choice.\n\nHis reply came, choked with acceleration sickness and the greater\nsickness of defeat:\n\n\"We will surrender.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNarth regained consciousness. He saw Humbolt sitting beside him as\nbefore, with no Gern rescuers crowding into the control room with\nshouted commands and drawn blasters.\n\n\"Where are they?\" he asked. \"Where is the battleship?\"\n\n\"We captured it,\" he said.\n\n\"You captured--a Gern battleship?\"\n\n\"It wasn't hard,\" he said. \"It would have been easier if only Ragnarok\nmen had been on the cruiser. We didn't want to accelerate to any higher\ngravities than absolutely necessary because of the Gerns on it.\"\n\n\"You did it--you captured the battleship,\" Narth said, his tone like one\ndazed.\n\nHe wet his lips, staring, as he contemplated the unpleasant implications\nof it.\n\n\"You're freak mutants who can capture a battleship. Maybe you will take\nAthena and Earth from us. But\"--the animation of hatred returned to his\nface--\"What good will it do you? Did you ever think about that?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"We've thought about it.\"\n\n\"Have you?\" Narth leaned forward, his face shining with the malice of\nhis gloating. \"You can never escape the consequences of what you have\ndone. The Gern Empire has the resources of dozens of worlds. The Empire\nwill build a fleet of special ships, a force against which your own will\nbe nothing, and send them to Earth and Athena and Ragnarok. The Empire\nwill smash you for what you have done and if there are any survivors of\nyour race left they will cringe before Gerns for a hundred generations\nto come.\n\n\"Remember that while you're posturing in your little hour of glory on\nAthena and Earth.\"\n\n\"You insist in thinking we'll do as Gerns would do,\" he said. \"We won't\ndelay to do any posturing. We'll have a large fleet when we leave Earth\nand we'll go at once to engage the Gern home fleet. I thought you knew\nwe were going to do that. We're going to cripple and capture your fleet\nand then we're going to destroy your empire.\"\n\n\"Destroy the Empire--_now_?\" Narth stared again, all the gloating gone\nas he saw, at last, the quick and inexorable end. \"Now--before we can\nstop you--before we can have a chance?\"\n\n\"When a race has been condemned to die by another race and it fights and\nstruggles and manages somehow to survive, it learns a lesson. It learns\nit must never again let the other race be in position to destroy it. So\nthis is the harvest you reap from the seeds you sowed on Ragnarok two\nhundred years ago.\n\n\"You understand, don't you?\" he asked, almost gently. \"For two hundred\nyears the Gern Empire has been a menace to our survival as a race. Now,\nthe time has come when we shall remove it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stood in the control room of the battleship and watched Athena's sun\nin the viewscreen, blazing like a white flame. Sigyn, fully recovered,\nwas stretched out on the floor near him; twitching and snarling a little\nin her sleep as she fought again the battle with the Gerns. Fenrir was\npacing the floor, swinging his black, massive head restlessly, while Tip\nand Freckles were examining with fascinated curiosity the collection of\nbright medals that had been cleaned out of the Gern commander's desk.\n\nLake and Craig left their stations, as impatient as Fenrir, and came\nover to watch the viewscreen with him.\n\n\"One day more,\" Craig said. \"We're two hundred years late but we're\ncoming in to the world that was to have been our home.\"\n\n\"It can never be, now,\" he said. \"Have any of us ever thought of\nthat--that we're different to humans and there's no human world we could\never call home?\"\n\n\"I've thought of it,\" Lake said. \"Ragnarok made us different physically\nand different in the way we think. We could live on human worlds--but\nwe would always be a race apart and never really belong there.\"\n\n\"I suppose we've all thought about it,\" Craig said. \"And wondered what\nwe'll do when we're finished with the Gerns. Not settle down on Athena\nor Earth, in a little cottage with a fenced-in lawn where it would be\nadventure to watch the Three-D shows after each day at some safe,\nroutine job.\"\n\n\"Not back to Ragnarok,\" Lake said. \"With metals and supplies from other\nworlds they'll be able to do a lot there but the battle is already won.\nThere will be left only the peaceful development--building a town at the\nequator for Big Winter, leveling land, planting crops. We could never be\nsatisfied with that kind of a life.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, and felt his own restlessness stir in protest at the\nthought of settling down in some safe and secure environment. \"Not\nAthena or Earth or Ragnarok--not any world we know.\"\n\n\"How long until we're finished with the Gerns?\" Lake asked. \"Ten years?\nWe'll still be young then. Where will we go--all of us who fought the\nGerns and all of the ones in the future who won't want to live out their\nlives on Ragnarok? Where is there a place for us--a world of our own?\"\n\n\"Where do we find a world of our own?\" he asked, and watched the star\nclouds creep toward them in the viewscreen; tumbled and blazing and\nimmense beyond conception.\n\n\"There's a galaxy for us to explore,\" he said. \"There are millions of\nsuns and thousands of worlds waiting for us. Maybe there are races out\nthere like the Gerns--and maybe there are races such as we were a\nhundred years ago who need our help. And maybe there are worlds out\nthere with things on them such as no man ever imagined.\n\n\"We'll go, to see what's there. Our women will go with us and there will\nbe some worlds on which some of us will want to stay. And, always, there\nwill be more restless ones coming from Ragnarok. Out there are the\nworlds and the homes for all of us.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Lake said. \"Beyond the space frontier ... where else would\nwe ever belong?\"\n\nIt was all settled, then, and there was a silence as the battleship\nplunged through hyperspace, the cruiser running beside her and their\ndrives moaning and thundering as had the drives of the _Constellation_\ntwo hundred years before.\n\nA voyage had been interrupted then, and a new race had been born. Now\nthey were going on again, to Athena, to Earth, to the farthest reaches\nof the Gern Empire. And on, to the wild, unknown regions of space\nbeyond.\n\nThere awaited their worlds and there awaited their destiny; to be a race\nscattered across a hundred thousand light-years of suns, to be an empire\nsuch as the galaxy had never known.\n\nThey, the restless ones, the unwanted and forgotten, the survivors.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nFOR SCIENCE FICTION FANS--\n\nA space-age collection of startling adventures!\n\nBRAIN TWISTER\n\nMark Phillips.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
