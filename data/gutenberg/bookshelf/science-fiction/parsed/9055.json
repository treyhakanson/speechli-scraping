He didn't want to use the\nweapon, but feared he might anyhow. This was a justifiable assumption,\nfor Caswell was a homicidal maniac.\n\nIt was a gentle, misty spring day and the air held the smell of rain\nand blossoming-dogwood. Caswell gripped the revolver in his sweaty\nright hand and tried to think of a single valid reason why he should\nnot kill a man named Magnessen, who, the other day, had commented on\nhow well Caswell looked.\n\nWhat business was it of Magnessen's how he looked? Damned busybodies,\nalways spoiling things for everybody....\n\nCaswell was a choleric little man with fierce red eyes, bulldog jowls\nand ginger-red hair. He was the sort you would expect to find perched\non a detergent box, orating to a crowd of lunching businessmen and\namused students, shouting, \"Mars for the Martians, Venus for the\nVenusians!\"\n\nBut in truth, Caswell was uninterested in the deplorable social\nconditions of extraterrestrials. He was a jetbus conductor for the New\nYork Rapid Transit Corporation. He minded his own business. And he was\nquite mad.\n\nFortunately, he knew this at least part of the time, with at least half\nof his mind.\n\n\n-- -- -- -- --\n\n\nPerspiring freely, Caswell continued down Broadway toward the 43rd\nStreet branch of Home Therapy Appliances, Inc. His friend Magnessen\nwould be finishing work soon, returning to his little apartment less\nthan a block from Caswell's. How easy it would be, how pleasant, to\nsaunter in, exchange a few words and....\n\nNo! Caswell took a deep gulp of air and reminded himself that he didn't\nreally want to kill anyone. It was not right to kill people. The\nauthorities would lock him up, his friends wouldn't understand, his\nmother would never have approved.\n\nBut these arguments seemed pallid, over-intellectual and entirely\nwithout force. The simple fact remained--he wanted to kill Magnessen.\n\nCould so strong a desire be wrong? Or even unhealthy?\n\nYes, it could! With an agonized groan, Caswell sprinted the last few\nsteps into the Home Therapy Appliances Store.\n\nJust being within such a place gave him an immediate sense of relief.\nThe lighting was discreet, the draperies were neutral, the displays of\nglittering therapy machines were neither too bland nor obstreperous. It\nwas the kind of place where a man could happily lie down on the carpet\nin the shadow of the therapy machines, secure in the knowledge that\nhelp for any sort of trouble was at hand.\n\nA clerk with fair hair and a long, supercilious nose glided up softly,\nbut not too softly, and murmured, \"May one help?\"\n\n\"Therapy!\" said Caswell.\n\n\"Of course, sir,\" the clerk answered, smoothing his lapels and smiling\nwinningly. \"That is what we are here for.\" He gave Caswell a searching\nlook, performed an instant mental diagnosis, and tapped a gleaming\nwhite-and-copper machine.\n\n\"Now this,\" the clerk said, \"is the new Alcoholic Reliever, built by\nIBM and advertised in the leading magazines. A handsome piece of\nfurniture, I think you will agree, and not out of place in any home. It\nopens into a television set.\"\n\nWith a flick of his narrow wrist, the clerk opened the Alcoholic\nReliever, revealing a 52-inch screen.\n\n\"I need--\" Caswell began.\n\n\"Therapy,\" the clerk finished for him. \"Of course. I just wanted to\npoint out that this model need never cause embarrassment for yourself,\nyour friends or loved ones. Notice, if you will, the recessed dial\nwhich controls the desired degree of drinking. See? If you do not wish\ntotal abstinence, you can set it to heavy, moderate, social or light.\nThat is a new feature, unique in mechanotherapy.\"\n\n\"I am not an alcoholic,\" Caswell said, with considerable dignity. \"The\nNew York Rapid Transit Corporation does not hire alcoholics.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the clerk, glancing distrustfully at Caswell's bloodshot\neyes. \"You seem a little nervous. Perhaps the portable Bendix Anxiety\nReducer--\"\n\n\"Anxiety's not my ticket, either. What have you got for homicidal\nmania?\"\n\nThe clerk pursed his lips. \"Schizophrenic or manic-depressive origins?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Caswell admitted, somewhat taken aback.\n\n\"It really doesn't matter,\" the clerk told him. \"Just a private theory\nof my own. From my experience in the store, redheads and blonds are\nprone to schizophrenia, while brunettes incline toward the\nmanic-depressive.\"\n\n\"That's interesting. Have you worked here long?\"\n\n\"A week. Now then, here is just what you need, sir.\" He put his hand\naffectionately on a squat black machine with chrome trim.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"That, sir, is the Rex Regenerator, built by General Motors. Isn't it\nhandsome? It can go with any decor and opens up into a well-stocked\nbar. Your friends, family, loved ones need never know--\"\n\n\"Will it cure a homicidal urge?\" Caswell asked. \"A strong one?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. Don't confuse this with the little ten amp neurosis\nmodels. This is a hefty, heavy-duty, twenty-five amp machine for a\nreally deep-rooted major condition.\"\n\n\"That's what I've got,\" said Caswell, with pardonable pride.\n\n\"This baby'll jolt it out of you. Big, heavy-duty thrust bearings!\nOversize heat absorbers! Completely insulated! Sensitivity range of over--\"\n\n\"I'll take it,\" Caswell said. \"Right now. I'll pay cash.\"\n\n\"Fine! I'll just telephone Storage and--\"\n\n\"This one'll do,\" Caswell said, pulling out his billfold. \"I'm in a\nhurry to use it. I want to kill my friend Magnessen, you know.\"\n\nThe clerk clucked sympathetically. \"You wouldn't want to do that ... Plus\nfive percent sales tax. Thank you, sir. Full instructions are inside.\"\n\nCaswell thanked him, lifted the Regenerator in both arms and hurried\nout.\n\nAfter figuring his commission, the clerk smiled to himself and lighted\na cigarette. His enjoyment was spoiled when the manager, a large man\nimpressively equipped with pince-nez, marched out of his office.\n\n\"Haskins,\" the manager said, \"I thought I asked you to rid yourself of\nthat filthy habit.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Follansby, sorry, sir,\" Haskins apologized, snubbing out the\ncigarette. \"I'll use the display Denicotinizer at once. Made rather a\ngood sale, Mr. Follansby. One of the big Rex Regenerators.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said the manager, impressed. \"It isn't often we--wait a minute!\nYou didn't sell the floor model, did you?\"\n\n\"Why--why, I'm afraid I did, Mr. Follansby. The customer was in such a\nterrible hurry. Was there any reason--\"\n\nMr. Follansby gripped his prominent white forehead in both hands, as\nthough he wished to rip it off. \"Haskins, I told you. I must have told\nyou! That display Regenerator was a Martian model. For giving\nmechanotherapy to Martians.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Haskins said. He thought for a moment. \"Oh.\"\n\nMr. Follansby stared at his clerk in grim silence.\n\n\"But does it really matter?\" Haskins asked quickly. \"Surely the machine\nwon't discriminate. I should think it would treat a homicidal tendency\neven if the patient were not a Martian.\"\n\n\"The Martian race has never had the slightest tendency toward homicide.\nA Martian Regenerator doesn't even process the concept. Of course the\nRegenerator will treat him. It has to. But what will it treat?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Haskins.\n\n\"That poor devil must be stopped before--you say he was homicidal? I don't\nknow what will happen! Quick, what is his address?\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Follansby, he was in such a terrible hurry--\"\n\nThe manager gave him a long, unbelieving look. \"Get the police! Call\nthe General Motors Security Division! Find him!\"\n\nHaskins raced for the door.\n\n\"Wait!\" yelled the manager, struggling into a raincoat. \"I'm coming,\ntoo.\"\n\n\n-- -- -- -- --\n\n\nElwood Caswell returned to his apartment by taxicopter. He lugged the\nRegenerator into his living room, put it down near the couch and\nstudied it thoughtfully.\n\n\"That clerk was right,\" he said after a while. \"It does go with the\nroom.\"\n\nEsthetically, the Regenerator was a success.\n\nCaswell admired it for a few more moments, then went into the kitchen\nand fixed himself a chicken sandwich. He ate slowly, staring fixedly at\na point just above and to the left of his kitchen clock.\n\nDamn you, Magnessen! Dirty no-good lying shifty-eyed enemy of all\nthat's decent and clean in the world....\n\nTaking the revolver from his pocket, he laid it on the table. With a\nstiffened forefinger, he poked it into different positions.\n\nIt was time to begin therapy.\n\nExcept that....\n\nCaswell realized worriedly that he didn't want to lose the desire to\nkill Magnessen. What would become of him if he lost that urge? His life\nwould lose all purpose, all coherence, all flavor and zest. It would be\nquite dull, really.\n\nMoreover, he had a great and genuine grievance against Magnessen, one\nhe didn't like to think about.\n\nIrene!\n\nHis poor sister, debauched by the subtle and insidious Magnessen,\nruined by him and cast aside. What better reason could a man have to\ntake his revolver and....\n\nCaswell finally remembered that he did not have a sister.\n\nNow was really the time to begin therapy.\n\nHe went into the living room and found the operating instructions\ntucked into a ventilation louver of the machine. He opened them and\nread:\n\nTo Operate All Rex Model Regenerators:\n\n1. Place the Regenerator near a comfortable couch. (A comfortable couch\ncan be purchased as an additional accessory from any General Motors\ndealer.)\n\n2. Plug in the machine.\n\n3. Affix the adjustable contact-band to the forehead.\n\nAnd that's all! Your Regenerator will do the rest! There will be no\nlanguage bar or dialect problem, since the Regenerator communicates by\nDirect Sense Contact (Patent Pending). All you must do is cooperate.\n\nTry not to feel any embarrassment or shame. Everyone has problems and\nmany are worse than yours! Your Regenerator has no interest in your\nmorals or ethical standards, so don't feel it is 'judging' you. It\ndesires only to aid you in becoming well and happy.\n\nAs soon as it has collected and processed enough data, your Regenerator\nwill begin treatment. You make the sessions as short or as long as you\nlike. You are the boss! And of course you can end a session at any time.\n\nThat's all there is to it! Simple, isn't it? Now plug in your General\nMotors Regenerator and GET SANE!\n\n\n-- -- -- -- --\n\n\n\"Nothing hard about that,\" Caswell said to himself. He pushed the\nRegenerator closer to the couch and plugged it in. He lifted the\nheadband, started to slip it on, stopped.\n\n\"I feel so silly!\" he giggled.\n\nAbruptly he closed his mouth and stared pugnaciously at the\nblack-and-chrome machine.\n\n\"So you think you can make me sane, huh?\"\n\nThe Regenerator didn't answer.\n\n\"Oh, well, go ahead and try.\" He slipped the headband over his\nforehead, crossed his arms on his chest and leaned back.\n\nNothing happened. Caswell settled himself more comfortably on the\ncouch. He scratched his shoulder and put the headband at a more\ncomfortable angle. Still nothing. His thoughts began to wander.\n\nMagnessen! You noisy, overbearing oaf, you disgusting--\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" a voice murmured in his head. \"I am your\nmechanotherapist.\"\n\nCaswell twitched guiltily. \"Hello. I was just--you know, just sort of--\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the machine said soothingly. \"Don't we all? I am now\nscanning the material in your preconscious with the intent of\nsynthesis, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. I find....\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Just one moment.\" The Regenerator was silent for several minutes.\nThen, hesitantly, it said, \"This is beyond doubt a most unusual case.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Caswell asked, pleased.\n\n\"Yes. The coefficients seem--I'm not sure....\" The machine's robotic\nvoice grew feeble. The pilot light began to flicker and fade.\n\n\"Hey, what's the matter?\"\n\n\"Confusion,\" said the machine. \"Of course,\" it went on in a stronger\nvoice, \"the unusual nature of the symptoms need not prove entirely\nbaffling to a competent therapeutic machine. A symptom, no matter how\nbizarre, is no more than a signpost, an indication of inner difficulty.\nAnd all symptoms can be related to the broad mainstream of proven\ntheory. Since the theory is effective, the symptoms must relate. We\nwill proceed on that assumption.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you know what you're doing?\" asked Caswell, feeling\nlightheaded.\n\nThe machine snapped back, its pilot light blazing. \"Mechanotherapy\ntoday is an exact science and admits no significant errors. We will\nproceed with a word-association test.\"\n\n\"Fire away,\" said Caswell.\n\n\"House?\"\n\n\"Home.\"\n\n\"Dog?\"\n\n\"Cat.\"\n\n\"Fleefl?\"\n\nCaswell hesitated, trying to figure out the word. It sounded vaguely\nMartian, but it might be Venusian or even--\n\n\"Fleefl?\" the Regenerator repeated.\n\n\"Marfoosh,\" Caswell replied, making up the word on the spur of the\nmoment.\n\n\"Loud?\"\n\n\"Sweet.\"\n\n\"Green?\"\n\n\"Mother.\"\n\n\"Thanagoyes?\"\n\n\"Patamathonga.\"\n\n\"Arrides?\"\n\n\"Nexothesmodrastica.\"\n\n\"Chtheesnohelgnopteces?\"\n\n\"Rigamaroo latasentricpropatria!\" Caswell shot back. It was a\ncollection of sounds he was particularly proud of. The average man\nwould not have been able to pronounce them.\n\n\"Hmm,\" said the Regenerator. \"The pattern fits. It always does.\"\n\n\"What pattern?\"\n\n\"You have,\" the machine informed him, \"a classic case of feem desire,\ncomplicated by strong dwarkish intentions.\"\n\n\"I do? I thought I was homicidal.\"\n\n\"That term has no referent,\" the machine said severely. \"Therefore I\nmust reject it as nonsense syllabification. Now consider these points:\nThe feem desire is perfectly normal. Never forget that. But it is\nusually replaced at an early age by the hovendish revulsion.\nIndividuals lacking in this basic environmental response--\"\n\n\"I'm not absolutely sure I know what you're talking about,\" Caswell\nconfessed.\n\n\"Please, sir! We must establish one thing at once. You are the patient.\nI am the mechanotherapist. You have brought your troubles to me for\ntreatment. But you cannot expect help unless you cooperate.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Caswell said. \"I'll try.\"\n\nUp to now, he had been bathed in a warm glow of superiority. Everything\nthe machine said had seemed mildly humorous. As a matter of fact, he\nhad felt capable of pointing out a few things wrong with the\nmechanotherapist.\n\nNow that sense of well-being evaporated, as it always did, and Caswell\nwas alone, terribly alone and lost, a creature of his compulsions, in\nsearch of a little peace and contentment.\n\nHe would undergo anything to find them. Sternly he reminded himself\nthat he had no right to comment on the mechanotherapist. These machines\nknew what they were doing and had been doing it for a long time. He\nwould cooperate, no matter how outlandish the treatment seemed from his\nlayman's viewpoint.\n\nBut it was obvious, Caswell thought, settling himself grimly on the\ncouch, that mechanotherapy was going to be far more difficult than he\nhad imagined.\n\n\n-- -- -- -- --\n\n\nThe search for the missing customer had been brief and useless. He was\nnowhere to be found on the teeming New York streets and no one could\nremember seeing a red-haired, red-eyed little man lugging a black\ntherapeutic machine.\n\nIt was all too common a sight.\n\nIn answer to an urgent telephone call, the police came immediately,\nfour of them, led by a harassed young lieutenant of detectives named\nSmith.\n\nSmith just had time to ask, \"Say, why don't you people put tags on\nthings?\" when there was an interruption.\n\nA man pushed his way past the policeman at the door. He was tall and\ngnarled and ugly, and his eyes were deep-set and bleakly blue. His\nclothes, unpressed and uncaring, hung on him like corrugated iron.\n\n\"What do you want?\" Lieutenant Smith asked.\n\nThe ugly man flipped back his lapel, showing a small silver badge\nbeneath. \"I'm John Rath, General Motors Security Division.\"\n\n\"Oh ... Sorry, sir,\" Lieutenant Smith said, saluting. \"I didn't think you\npeople would move in so fast.\"\n\nRath made a noncommittal noise. \"Have you checked for prints,\nLieutenant? The customer might have touched some other therapy machine.\"\n\n\"I'll get right on it, sir,\" Smith said. It wasn't often that one of\nthe operatives from GM, GE, or IBM came down to take a personal hand.\nIf a local cop showed he was really clicking, there just might be the\npossibility of an Industrial Transfer....\n\nRath turned to Follansby and Haskins, and transfixed them with a gaze\nas piercing and as impersonal as a radar beam. \"Let's have the full\nstory,\" he said, taking a notebook and pencil from a shapeless pocket.\n\nHe listened to the tale in ominous silence. Finally he closed his\nnotebook, thrust it back into his pocket and said, \"The therapeutic\nmachines are a sacred trust. To give a customer the wrong machine is a\nbetrayal of that trust, a violation of the Public Interest, and a\ndefamation of the Company's good reputation.\"\n\nThe manager nodded in agreement, glaring at his unhappy clerk.\n\n\"A Martian model,\" Rath continued, \"should never have been on the floor\nin the first place.\"\n\n\"I can explain that,\" Follansby said hastily. \"We needed a demonstrator\nmodel and I wrote to the Company, telling them--\"\n\n\"This might,\" Rath broke in inexorably, \"be considered a case of gross\ncriminal negligence.\"\n\nBoth the manager and the clerk exchanged horrified looks. They were\nthinking of the General Motors Reformatory outside of Detroit, where\nCompany offenders passed their days in sullen silence, monotonously\ndrawing microcircuits for pocket television sets.\n\n\"However, that is out of my jurisdiction,\" Rath said. He turned his\nbaleful gaze full upon Haskins. \"You are certain that the customer\nnever mentioned his name?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I mean yes, I'm sure,\" Haskins replied rattledly.\n\n\"Did he mention any names at all?\"\n\nHaskins plunged his face into his hands. He looked up and said eagerly,\n\"Yes! He wanted to kill someone! A friend of his!\"\n\n\"Who?\" Rath asked, with terrible patience.\n\n\"The friend's name was--let me think--Magneton! That was it! Magneton!\nOr was it Morrison? Oh, dear....\"\n\nMr. Rath's iron face registered a rather corrugated disgust. People\nwere useless as witnesses. Worse than useless, since they were\nfrequently misleading. For reliability, give him a robot every time.\n\n\"Didn't he mention anything significant?\"\n\n\"Let me think!\" Haskins said, his face twisting into a fit of\nconcentration.\n\nRath waited.\n\nMr. Follansby cleared his throat. \"I was just thinking, Mr. Rath. About\nthat Martian machine. It won't treat a Terran homicidal case as\nhomicidal, will it?\"\n\n\"Of course not. Homicide is unknown on Mars.\"\n\n\"Yes. But what will it do? Might it not reject the entire case as\nunsuitable? Then the customer would merely return the Regenerator with\na complaint and we would--\"\n\nMr. Rath shook his head. \"The Rex Regenerator must treat if it finds\nevidence of psychosis. By Martian standards, the customer is a very\nsick man, a psychotic--no matter what is wrong with him.\"\n\nFollansby removed his pince-nez and polished them rapidly. \"What will\nthe machine do, then?\"\n\n\"It will treat him for the Martian illness most analogous to his case.\nFeem desire, I should imagine, with various complications. As for what\nwill happen once treatment begins, I don't know. I doubt whether anyone\nknows, since it has never happened before. Offhand, I would say there\nare two major alternatives: the patient may reject the therapy out of\nhand, in which case he is left with his homicidal mania unabated. Or he\nmay accept the Martian therapy and reach a cure.\"\n\nMr. Follansby's face brightened. \"Ah! A cure is possible!\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" Rath said. \"He may effect a cure of his\nnonexistent Martian psychosis. But to cure something that is not there\nis, in effect, to erect a gratuitous delusional system. You might say\nthat the machine would work in reverse, producing psychosis instead of\nremoving it.\"\n\nMr. Follansby groaned and leaned against a Bell Psychosomatica.\n\n\"The result,\" Rath summed up, \"would be to convince the customer that\nhe was a Martian. A sane Martian, naturally.\"\n\nHaskins suddenly shouted, \"I remember! I remember now! He said he\nworked for the New York Rapid Transit Corporation! I remember\ndistinctly!\"\n\n\"That's a break,\" Rath said, reaching for the telephone.\n\nHaskins wiped his perspiring face in relief. \"And I just remembered\nsomething else that should make it easier still.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The customer said he had been an alcoholic at one time. I'm sure of\nit, because he was interested at first in the IBM Alcoholic Reliever,\nuntil I talked him out of it. He had red hair, you know, and I've had a\ntheory for some time about red-headedness and alcoholism. It seems--\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" Rath said. \"Alcoholism will be on his records. It narrows\nthe search considerably.\"\n\nAs he dialed the NYRT Corporation, the expression on his craglike face\nwas almost pleasant.\n\nIt was good, for a change, to find that a human could retain some\nsignificant facts.\n\n\n-- -- -- -- --\n\n\n\"But surely you remember your goricae?\" the Regenerator was saying.\n\n\"No,\" Caswell answered wearily.\n\n\"Tell me, then, about your juvenile experiences with the thorastrian\nfleep.\"\n\n\"Never had any.\"\n\n\"Hmm. Blockage,\" muttered the machine. \"Resentment. Repression. Are you\nsure you don't remember your goricae and what it meant to you? The\nexperience is universal.\"\n\n\"Not for me,\" Caswell said, swallowing a yawn.\n\nHe had been undergoing mechanotherapy for close to four hours and it\nstruck him as futile. For a while, he had talked voluntarily about his\nchildhood, his mother and father, his older brother. But the\nRegenerator had asked him to put aside those fantasies. The patient's\nrelationships to an imaginary parent or sibling, it explained, were\nunworkable and of minor importance psychologically. The important thing\nwas the patient's feelings--both revealed and repressed--toward his\ngoricae.\n\n\"Aw, look,\" Caswell complained, \"I don't even know what a goricae is.\"\n\n\"Of course you do. You just won't let yourself know.\"\n\n\"I don't know. Tell me.\"\n\n\"It would be better if you told me.\"\n\n\"How can I?\" Caswell raged. \"I don't know!\"\n\n\"What do you imagine a goricae would be?\"\n\n\"A forest fire,\" Caswell said. \"A salt tablet. A jar of denatured\nalcohol. A small screwdriver. Am I getting warm? A notebook. A revolver--\"\n\n\"These associations are meaningful,\" the Regenerator assured him. \"Your\nattempt at randomness shows a clearly underlying pattern. Do you begin\nto recognize it?\"\n\n\"What in hell is a goricae?\" Caswell roared.\n\n\"The tree that nourished you during infancy, and well into puberty, if\nmy theory about you is correct. Inadvertently, the goricae stifled your\nnecessary rejection of the feem desire. This in turn gave rise to your\npresent urge to dwark someone in a vlendish manner.\"\n\n\"No tree nourished me.\"\n\n\"You cannot recall the experience?\"\n\n\"Of course not. It never happened.\"\n\n\"You are sure of that?\"\n\n\"Positive.\"\n\n\"Not even the tiniest bit of doubt?\"\n\n\"No! No goricae ever nourished me. Look, I can break off these sessions\nat any time, right?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the Regenerator said. \"But it would not be advisable at\nthis moment. You are expressing anger, resentment, fear. By your\nrigidly summary rejection--\"\n\n\"Nuts,\" said Caswell, and pulled off the headband.\n\n\n-- -- -- -- --\n\n\nThe silence was wonderful. Caswell stood up, yawned, stretched and\nmassaged the back of his neck. He stood in front of the humming black\nmachine and gave it a long leer.\n\n\"You couldn't cure me of a common cold,\" he told it.\n\nStiffly he walked the length of the living room and returned to the\nRegenerator.\n\n\"Lousy fake!\" he shouted.\n\nCaswell went into the kitchen and opened a bottle of beer. His revolver\nwas still on the table, gleaming dully.\n\nMagnessen! You unspeakable treacherous filth! You fiend incarnate! You\ninhuman, hideous monster! Someone must destroy you, Magnessen! Someone....\n\nSomeone? He himself would have to do it. Only he knew the bottomless\ndepths of Magnessen's depravity, his viciousness, his disgusting lust\nfor power.\n\nYes, it was his duty, Caswell thought. But strangely, the knowledge\nbrought him no pleasure.\n\nAfter all, Magnessen was his friend.\n\nHe stood up, ready for action. He tucked the revolver into his\nright-hand coat pocket and glanced at the kitchen clock. Nearly\nsix-thirty. Magnessen would be home now, gulping his dinner, grinning\nover his plans.\n\nThis was the perfect time to take him.\n\nCaswell strode to the door, opened it, started through, and stopped.\n\nA thought had crossed his mind, a thought so tremendously involved, so\nmeaningful, so far-reaching in its implications that he was stirred to\nhis depths. Caswell tried desperately to shake off the knowledge it\nbrought. But the thought, permanently etched upon his memory, would not\ndepart.\n\nUnder the circumstances, he could do only one thing.\n\nHe returned to the living room, sat down on the couch and slipped on\nthe headband.\n\nThe Regenerator said, \"Yes?\"\n\n\"It's the damnedest thing,\" Caswell said, \"but do you know, I think I\ndo remember my goricae!\"\n\n\n-- -- -- -- --\n\n\nJohn Rath contacted the New York Rapid Transit Corporation by televideo\nand was put into immediate contact with Mr. Bemis, a plump, tanned man\nwith watchful eyes.\n\n\"Alcoholism?\" Mr. Bemis repeated, after the problem was explained.\nUnobtrusively, he turned on his tape recorder. \"Among our employees?\"\nPressing a button beneath his foot, Bemis alerted Transit Security,\nPublicity, Intercompany Relations, and the Psychoanalysis Division.\nThis done, he looked earnestly at Rath. \"Not a chance of it, my dear\nsir. Just between us, why does General Motors really want to know?\"\n\nRath smiled bitterly. He should have anticipated this. NYRT and GM had\nhad their differences in the past. Officially, there was cooperation\nbetween the two giant corporations. But for all practical purposes--\n\n\"The question is in terms of the Public Interest,\" Rath said.\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" Mr. Bemis replied, with a subtle smile. Glancing at\nhis tattle board, he noticed that several company executives had tapped\nin on his line. This might mean a promotion, if handled properly.\n\n\"The Public Interest of GM,\" Mr. Bemis added with polite nastiness.\n\"The insinuation is, I suppose, that drunken conductors are operating\nour jetbuses and helis?\"\n\n\"Of course not. I was searching for a single alcoholic predilection, an\nindividual latency--\"\n\n\"There's no possibility of it. We at Rapid Transit do not hire people\nwith even the merest tendency in that direction. And may I suggest,\nsir, that you clean your own house before making implications about\nothers?\"\n\nAnd with that, Mr. Bemis broke the connection.\n\nNo one was going to put anything over on him.\n\n\"Dead end,\" Rath said heavily. He turned and shouted, \"Smith! Did you\nfind any prints?\"\n\nLieutenant Smith, his coat off and sleeves rolled up, bounded over.\n\"Nothing usable, sir.\"\n\nRath's thin lips tightened. It had been close to seven hours since the\ncustomer had taken the Martian machine. There was no telling what harm\nhad been done by now. The customer would be justified in bringing suit\nagainst the Company. Not that the money mattered much; it was the bad\npublicity that was to be avoided at all costs.\n\n\"Beg pardon, sir,\" Haskins said.\n\nRath ignored him. What next? Rapid Transit was not going to cooperate.\nWould the Armed Services make their records available for scansion by\nsomatotype and pigmentation?\n\n\"Sir,\" Haskins said again.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I just remembered the customer's friend's name. It was Magnessen.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of that?\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Haskins said, with the first confidence he had shown in\nhours. \"I've taken the liberty of looking him up in the telephone book,\nsir. There's only one Manhattan listing under that name.\"\n\nRath glowered at him from under shaggy eyebrows. \"Haskins, I hope you\nare not wrong about this. I sincerely hope that.\"\n\n\"I do too, sir,\" Haskins admitted, feeling his knees begin to shake.\n\n\"Because if you are,\" Rath said, \"I will ... Never mind. Let's go!\"\n\n\n-- -- -- -- --\n\n\nBy police escort, they arrived at the address in fifteen minutes. It\nwas an ancient brownstone and Magnessen's name was on a second-floor\ndoor. They knocked.\n\nThe door opened and a stocky, crop-headed, shirt-sleeved man in his\nthirties stood before them. He turned slightly pale at the sight of so\nmany uniforms, but held his ground.\n\n\"What is this?\" he demanded.\n\n\"You Magnessen?\" Lieutenant Smith barked.\n\n\"Yeah. What's the beef? If it's about my hi-fi playing too loud, I can\ntell you that old hag downstairs--\"\n\n\"May we come in?\" Rath asked. \"It's important.\"\n\nMagnessen seemed about to refuse, so Rath pushed past him, followed by\nSmith, Follansby, Haskins, and a small army of policemen. Magnessen\nturned to face them, bewildered, defiant and more than a little awed.\n\n\"Mr. Magnessen,\" Rath said, in the pleasantest voice he could muster,\n\"I hope you'll forgive the intrusion. Let me assure you, it is in the\nPublic Interest, as well as your own. Do you know a short,\nangry-looking, red-haired, red-eyed man?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Magnessen said slowly and warily.\n\nHaskins let out a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Would you tell us his name and address?\" asked Rath.\n\n\"I suppose you mean--hold it! What's he done?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Then what you want him for?\"\n\n\"There's no time for explanations,\" Rath said. \"Believe me, it's in his\nown best interest, too. What is his name?\"\n\nMagnessen studied Rath's ugly, honest face, trying to make up his mind.\n\nLieutenant Smith said, \"Come on, talk, Magnessen, if you know what's\ngood for you. We want the name and we want it quick.\"\n\nIt was the wrong approach. Magnessen lighted a cigarette, blew smoke in\nSmith's direction and inquired, \"You got a warrant, buddy?\"\n\n\"You bet I have,\" Smith said, striding forward. \"I'll warrant you, wise\nguy.\"\n\n\"Stop it!\" Rath ordered. \"Lieutenant Smith, thank you for your\nassistance. I won't need you any longer.\"\n\nSmith left sulkily, taking his platoon with him.\n\nRath said, \"I apologize for Smith's over-eagerness. You had better hear\nthe problem.\" Briefly but fully, he told the story of the customer and\nthe Martian therapeutic machine.\n\nWhen he was finished, Magnessen looked more suspicious than ever. \"You\nsay he wants to kill me?\"\n\n\"Definitely.\"\n\n\"That's a lie! I don't know what your game is, mister, but you'll never\nmake me believe that. Elwood's my best friend. We been best friends\nsince we was kids. We been in service together. Elwood would cut off\nhis arm for me. And I'd do the same for him.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" Rath said impatiently, \"in a sane frame of mind, he would.\nBut your friend Elwood--is that his first name or last?\"\n\n\"First,\" Magnessen said tauntingly.\n\n\"Your friend Elwood is psychotic.\"\n\n\"You don't know him. That guy loves me like a brother. Look, what's\nElwood really done? Defaulted on some payments or something? I can help\nout.\"\n\n\"You thickheaded imbecile!\" Rath shouted. \"I'm trying to save your\nlife, and the life and sanity of your friend!\"\n\n\"But how do I know?\" Magnessen pleaded. \"You guys come busting in here--\"\n\n\"You can trust me,\" Rath said.\n\nMagnessen studied Rath's face and nodded sourly. \"His name's Elwood\nCaswell. He lives just down the block at number 341.\"\n\n\n-- -- -- -- --\n\n\nThe man who came to the door was short, with red hair and red-rimmed\neyes. His right hand was thrust into his coat pocket. He seemed very\ncalm.\n\n\"Are you Elwood Caswell?\" Rath asked. \"The Elwood Caswell who bought a\nRegenerator early this afternoon at the Home Therapy Appliances Store?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Caswell. \"Won't you come in?\"\n\nInside Caswell's small living room, they saw the Regenerator,\nglistening black and chrome, standing near the couch. It was unplugged.\n\n\"Have you used it?\" Rath asked anxiously.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nFollansby stepped forward. \"Mr. Caswell, I don't know how to explain\nthis, but we made a terrible mistake. The Regenerator you took was a\nMartian model--for giving therapy to Martians.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Caswell.\n\n\"You do?\"\n\n\"Of course. It became pretty obvious after a while.\"\n\n\"It was a dangerous situation,\" Rath said. \"Especially for a man with\nyour--ah--troubles.\" He studied Caswell covertly. The man seemed fine, but\nappearances were frequently deceiving, especially with psychotics.\nCaswell had been homicidal; there was no reason why he should not still\nbe.\n\nAnd Rath began to wish he had not dismissed Smith and his policemen so\nsummarily. Sometimes an armed squad was a comforting thing to have\naround.\n\nCaswell walked across the room to the therapeutic machine. One hand was\nstill in his jacket pocket; the other he laid affectionately upon the\nRegenerator.\n\n\"The poor thing tried its best,\" he said. \"Of course, it couldn't cure\nwhat wasn't there.\" He laughed. \"But it came very near succeeding!\"\n\n\n-- -- -- -- --\n\n\nRath studied Caswell's face and said, in a trained, casual tone, \"Glad\nthere was no harm, sir. The Company will, of course, reimburse you for\nyour lost time and for your mental anguish--\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" Caswell said.\n\n\"--and we will substitute a proper Terran Regenerator at once.\"\n\n\"That won't be necessary.\"\n\n\"It won't?\"\n\n\"No.\" Caswell's voice was decisive. \"The machine's attempt at therapy\nforced me into a compete self-appraisal. There was a moment of absolute\ninsight, during which I was able to evaluate and discard my homicidal\nintentions toward poor Magnessen.\"\n\nRath nodded dubiously. \"You feel no such urge now?\"\n\n\"Not in the slightest.\"\n\nRath frowned deeply, started to say something, and stopped. He turned\nto Follansby and Haskins. \"Get that machine out of here. I'll have a\nfew things to say to you at the store.\"\n\nThe manager and the clerk lifted the Regenerator and left.\n\nRath took a deep breath. \"Mr. Caswell, I would strongly advise that you\naccept a new Regenerator from the Company, gratis. Unless a cure is\neffected in a proper mechanotherapeutic manner, there is always the\ndanger of a setback.\"\n\n\"No danger with me,\" Caswell said, airily but with deep conviction.\n\"Thank you for your consideration, sir. And good night.\"\n\nRath shrugged and walked to the door.\n\n\"Wait!\" Caswell called.\n\nRath turned. Caswell had taken his hand out of his pocket. In it was a\nrevolver. Rath felt sweat trickle down his arms. He calculated the\ndistance between himself and Caswell. Too far.\n\n\"Here,\" Caswell said, extending the revolver butt-first. \"I won't need\nthis any longer.\"\n\nRath managed to keep his face expressionless as he accepted the\nrevolver and stuck it into a shapeless pocket.\n\n\"Good night,\" Caswell said. He closed the door behind Rath and bolted\nit.\n\nAt last he was alone.\n\nCaswell walked into the kitchen. He opened a bottle of beer, took a\ndeep swallow and sat down at the kitchen table. He stared fixedly at a\npoint just above and to the left of the clock.\n\nHe had to form his plans now. There was no time to lose.\n\nMagnessen! That inhuman monster who cut down the Caswell goricae!\nMagnessen! The man who, even now, was secretly planning to infect New\nYork with the abhorrent feem desire! Oh, Magnessen, I wish you a long,\nlong life, filled with the torture I can inflict on you. And to start\nwith....\n\nCaswell smiled to himself as he planned exactly how he would dwark\nMagnessen in a vlendish manner.\n\n\nThe End\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Bad Medicine, by Robert Sheckley\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BAD MEDICINE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 9055.txt or 9055.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/9/0/5/9055/\n\nProduced by an anonymous Project Gutenberg volunteer.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
