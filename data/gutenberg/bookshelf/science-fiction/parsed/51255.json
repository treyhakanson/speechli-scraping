His hands were\nalmost steady.\n\n\"Want to place a limit on the bets?\" he asked.\n\nHis two colleagues who had made the night drive with him from the\nUniversity said nothing, but Rothman laughed.\n\n\"Today?\" he said. \"Today, the sky's the limit.\"\n\nMacPherson rested the deck on the table and watched as Rothman stood\nup to look through the barred window at the glittering Arizona desert.\nRothman had got thinner during his months of confinement; his shoulders\nwere bony beneath the gray hospital robe and his balding head looked\nlike a skull.\n\n\"Are you going to play?\" asked MacPherson. \"Or is poker too childish an\namusement for a mathematician?\"\n\nRothman turned his back to the window. \"Oh, I'll play. When three old\nfriends from the Project suddenly turn up for a visit, even a madman\nwill string along.\"\n\nShuffling the cards again, MacPherson wished the other men would say\nsomething; it wasn't fair of them to make him carry the conversation.\nProfessor Avery, who had cut his physics classes in order to join the\nmorning's party, sat in glum silence. His plump face was pale, and\nbehind thick-lensed spectacles which enlarged his eyes grotesquely, he\nblinked as he watched the flickering cards. Dr. Neill, from Physical\nChemistry, was tapping his toe against the table leg, watching Rothman,\nwho stood at the window, waiting.\n\n\"But we can't have much of a game with only four people,\" said Rothman.\n\"We ought to have a fifth.\"\n\n\"Maybe we can find someone.\" MacPherson walked to the locked steel door\nand rattled the rectangular lattice set in at shoulder height, put his\nmouth to the metal bars and called out.\n\n\"Hey, Joe!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn attendant in white uniform shuffled into the corridor of closed\ndoors, carrying a tray with one hand and scratching his head with the\nother.\n\n\"How about joining us for a game of poker?\"\n\nJoe shook his head and grinned. \"Not me, Professor! I start buddying\naround with the loonies, I lose my job.\"\n\n\"But we're not inmates!\"\n\n\"Maybe not, but Dr. Rothman is.\"\n\n\"Doesn't prove I'm crazy, Joe,\" said Rothman. \"Conversely, not being\ninmates doesn't prove these men are sane.\"\n\n\"It's a fact you don't look any crazier to me than a lot of\nprofessors,\" confessed Joe. \"I don't know. All I know is, _I'm_\nnot crazy enough to break the rules and lose my job. Besides, you\nlong-hairs wouldn't stand a chance at poker with me.\"\n\nStill grinning, he shuffled out of sight down the hall.\n\nMacPherson sighed and went back to the table. \"Well, we'll have to get\nalong with just the four of us.\"\n\n\"There's always the unseen guest,\" said Rothman, \"but you won't need to\ndeal him a hand. He already holds all the cards.\"\n\nNeill looked up. \"Stop hamming and sit down. Quit making like a maniac.\nIt's not even a good act.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Rothman drew up a chair. \"Now what was said about limiting the\nbets?\"\n\n\"Why bother setting a limit?\" said Neill. \"We're not likely to mistake\neach other for millionaires and we all got exactly the same pay when we\nwere on the Project. Unless your sick pay has had two or three zeros\ntacked onto it, you're not going to be making any wild bets, and as for\nthe rest of us--\"\n\n\"University professors are still being paid less than nightclub\ndancers,\" said Avery. \"You're lucky to be out of the rat race,\nRothman. While we worry about how to pay the grocery bill, you can\nrelax, eating and sleeping at government expense. You never had it so\ngood.\"\n\n\"Maybe you'd like to get yourselves committed and keep me company?\"\n\nMacPherson rapped the deck on the table. \"Stop that kind of talk. We\ncame here to play poker.\"\n\n\"Did you?\" asked Rothman, grinning. \"Then why don't you deal?\"\n\n\"Cut, Neill?\" said MacPherson. As he shot the slippery cards over the\ntable top, each flick of his thumb watched by Rothman's intent eyes,\nhe regretted this impulsive visit; it now seemed a gesture without\nmeaning. He wondered whether the others were as nervous as he was.\n\nOn the drive over from Los Angeles during the night, Neill had seemed\ncalm enough and even Avery, who had changed a lot during work on the\nProject, had chatted with them unconstrainedly. It was hard to be\ncertain what other men were feeling, even when you had known them a\nlong time, but it could not be pleasant for any of them to be visiting\na former colleague who had been removed from the Project directly to a\nsanitarium.\n\n\"Tell me something,\" said Rothman as he picked up his cards. \"Do you\nstill think I'm crazy?\"\n\n\"Don't be an idiot,\" MacPherson snapped. \"Do you think we'd cut our\nclasses and drive nearly five hundred miles just to play poker with a\nlunatic?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Rothman. \"That's how I know. But why aren't you frank about\nit? Why keep on pretending there wasn't a special reason for your\nvisit?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNeill was beating his foot against the table leg again and Avery's eyes\nwere hard and staring as he examined his cards.\n\n\"Who'll open?\" MacPherson asked. \"I can't.\"\n\n\"I can,\" said Rothman. \"I'm betting one blue chip. Listen, Avery, why\nwon't you look at me? If you think I'm hamming, what do you call your\nown act? How long are we going to go on kidding each other? They've\nshut me up here, but that doesn't mean they've stopped me from logical\nthinking. My three old friends from the Project don't turn up in the\nmiddle of a Friday morning just to calm my fevered brain with a card\ngame.\"\n\n\"What's wrong with poker?\" demanded MacPherson.\n\n\"Poker? Nothing. I know--It must be the test. Total conversion of\nmatter to energy. Not just a minute percentage any more--_total_\nconversion. They've finished the set, haven't they? They're ready to\ntest. They're going to disintegrate Waaku, aren't they? It must be\ntoday. Then this is the day the world ends. Tell me, when is zero hour?\"\n\nNeill's cards had slipped from his fingers and he stooped to the floor,\nfumbling for them. Avery was bending one corner of a card, creasing it,\nsmoothing it out, and creasing it again. Nobody was going to answer,\nMacPherson realized. They were leaving it up to him.\n\nHe spoke sharply. \"You're getting onto forbidden ground, Rothman. You\nknow we're not allowed to discuss the Project with you. We're allowed\nto visit you only under the strictest promise not to speak of it at\nall. You're certainly rational enough to understand what the therapists\nhave told you, that you'd get well easily enough if you'd stop\nworrying. Forget about zero hour. Everything's going to be all right.\"\n\nRothman turned to look out the window. \"Is it today?\"\n\n\"How should we know? We're only innocent bystanders now, like you.\nRemember, we all left the Project over six months ago, except Avery,\nand last month they let him go.\"\n\nNeill had rearranged his cards now and he looked at them instead of\nRothman as he spoke. \"There's nothing to worry about. Your calculations\nwere wrong. The test is not going to get out of control--if and when\nthey make it. But they don't tell us things any more.\"\n\n\"Since they fired you,\" said Rothman.\n\n\"That's right, since they fired us,\" Neill said. The creased corner of\na card suddenly broke off in his fingers.\n\n\"If you didn't believe in my calculations, why did you back me up? I\ndidn't ask you to. If you didn't believe in the danger, why didn't you\nstay out of the argument and keep your jobs? It wasn't your fight. You\ncould have kept out of it--or attacked me, like Avery.\"\n\n\"All we did was insist that even if you had made a mistake in your\ncalculations, that didn't necessarily prove you were crazy,\" said\nNeill. \"We didn't know whether you were right or not. We couldn't argue\nabout the math. Avery tore that to pieces and the boys at Columbia and\nHarvard backed him up. MacPherson and I aren't competent to check your\nmath. To us, you didn't seem any crazier than the people who sent you\nhere. But after you'd scared them silly, they had to do something to\nstop your scaring other people.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned to pick up his cards again, but stopped at the sight of\nAvery. Avery was standing and crumpling a card spasmodically, his lips\nwere moving without sound, and he was breathing rapidly.\n\n\"Look here,\" said MacPherson. \"You'd better change the subject. If\nlittle Joe passes by the door and hears us talking about the Project,\nhe'll have our visiting privileges revoked before you can say nuclear\nfission, and they'll stay revoked forever.\"\n\n\"How long is forever?\" asked Rothman.\n\nAvery threw down his cards and walked to the window. Through the bars,\nthere was nothing to be seen but the expanse of sand, glinting in the\nmorning sun, and a cactus plant casting a stubby shadow. He whirled to\nface the others.\n\n\"Look, MacPherson,\" he burst out. \"I'm fed up with this game. Snookums\nRothman mustn't think about the Project any more, so we mustn't say the\nnaughty word. But we were all in it together at the beginning and there\nwas a while when we were all every bit as scared as he was. Why not\ntell him we came this morning in case--just in case--he'd heard about\nthe test and was worrying? What's the harm in telling him what the\nwhole university knows? That zero hour is today, this morning, now!\"\n\n\"Shut up, you fool!\" said MacPherson.\n\nBut Rothman glanced at his cards again, then looked up. \"When does it\nbegin? What time is it now?\"\n\n\"Don't answer!\" shouted MacPherson. \"Are you trying to knock him off\nbalance again?\"\n\n\"I will answer!\" said Avery. \"I'm going to tell him. He scared us silly\nwith his calculations; now let us scare him with some cold facts. It'll\ndo him good. Maybe when the test is over, if he finds--I mean _when_ he\nfinds--he was wrong, he'll be cured.\"\n\n\"Yes, and maybe he'll really be crazy.\"\n\nGrabbing Avery fiercely by the arm, MacPherson tried to drag him to the\ndoor, but Avery broke away.\n\n\"Listen, Rothman!\" Avery's breath was coming quick and shallow. \"Today\nis the day! Zero hour is eleven o'clock this morning!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMacPherson sagged. No one spoke or moved as they all watched Rothman.\n\nAt last Rothman sighed, once. \"What time is it now?\"\n\nFrom the door came a scratching sound. MacPherson turned to see Joe,\ngrinning at them through the steel lattice.\n\n\"How's things?\" Joe wanted to know. \"Thought I heard a commotion in\nhere. Doc Rothman's not acting up, I hope?\"\n\n\"Everything's under control, Joe,\" MacPherson assured him. \"Just having\na friendly game.\"\n\n\"Don't cheat while they're watching you,\" said Joe, and his face\ndisappeared.\n\n\"Well, the murder's out,\" said MacPherson.\n\n\"No use kidding you any longer,\" Neill said, fanning his cards.\n\"Eleven o'clock this morning. Six o'clock tomorrow morning, Waaku time.\nBut it's just another test. Nothing's going to happen.\"\n\nAvery took off his glasses and began to polish the lenses. \"Any idea\nof a possible chain reaction is ridiculous. As a matter of fact, I\nrecently spent a full week checking the math again myself, so I know.\nBut we knew how you felt about it, Rothman, and we didn't want you to\nbe worrying here all alone, in case you'd found out. That's why we\ncame.\"\n\nRothman was looking out the window. He did not answer. Slowly\nMacPherson went back to his chair and picked up his cards. \"And now how\nabout playing some poker? Rothman, you opened for a blue. What about\nyou, Neill?\"\n\n\"I'm staying,\" said Neill, shoving in a chip. \"Always was a gambler.\nI'm going to stay till the cows come home.\"\n\n\"What time is it?\" Rothman asked. \"I haven't got a wristwatch. They\nthink I might break the crystal and cut my throat.\"\n\nMacPherson slammed down his cards and jerked his watch from his pocket.\n\"What does it matter what time it is? Why couldn't they give you a\nwatch with a plastic crystal? If you have to know, it's eleven-forty.\"\n\n\"And thirteen seconds,\" added Neill.\n\n\"Then it's already started,\" said Rothman.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe leaned his head against the back of his chair and closed his eyes.\n\"It's on its way now. There's somewhat more than a third of the\nEarth between us and Waaku--the place where Waaku was, I mean. The\ndisintegration wave is moving slowly. The seismic wave of an earthquake\nwould get here in about fifty minutes, more or less. But the shock wave\nfrom Waaku, traveling somewhere around five thousand miles an hour,\nwill need about an hour and seventeen minutes, plus or minus a minute\nor so. That means it will reach us in about thirty-seven minutes from\nnow, and the disintegration wave is following close behind. Well, nice\nto have known you, fellows. Anyone want to check my math?\"\n\nHe waved toward the desk behind him, piled high with manuscript and a\nsprawling heap of books on which rested a slide-rule.\n\n\"Calm down,\" said MacPherson. \"Nothing is going to happen. Damn you,\nAvery! Are you proud of what you accomplished?\"\n\nAvery glared. \"It'll do him good! He's got to learn to face reality,\nlike the rest of us. In a little more than half an hour, the test will\nbe finished. The world will still be here. Rothman will have to admit\nhis equations were wrong--and then he'll be cured.\"\n\nRothman leaned forward. \"Or contrariwise, Rothman will _not_ have to\nadmit he was wrong and Rothman will _not_ be cured! If I made a mistake\nin my math, why couldn't anybody put his finger on it? I'm not so crazy\nthat I wouldn't be able to see an error in calculus when it was pointed\nout to me. If you're sure my calculations are wrong, why do you look so\nfrightened?\"\n\n\"Do we have to go over all that again?\" said MacPherson. \"The boys\nat Columbia told you where the mistake was. It's where you inverted\nthat twelve-by-twelve matrix. Didn't you bother to check the inverted\nmatrix?\"\n\n\"The same old tale.\" Rothman picked up his cards. \"No mathematician\nwill ever admit that another mathematician could invent a method beyond\nhis comprehension. Still harping on an error in my inverted matrix.\nWhat time is it now?\"\n\n\"There's no doubt that your calculations are wrong,\" said Neill, \"but\nI still don't see why we have to insist on proving it the hard way.\nWith bombs, why do we need to fool around with the total disintegration\nof matter? Sure, I know the new model releases a googol times the\nenergy you get out of uranium fission, but who cares? There's plenty of\nuranium for our needs.\"\n\n\"The trouble with uranium is that it doesn't make a big enough bang,\"\nsaid MacPherson. \"People aren't impressed by it any more. The same\ngoes for plutonium, even for lithium, at least for any size bomb we\ncan make. The idea is to show the world something so convincing that\nthey'll never even think of a war again. When they see every island in\nthe Waaku chain wiped off the map, they'll get the point.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAvery creased another card and cleared his throat. \"_Did_ you check the\ninverted twelve-by-twelve, Rothman?\"\n\n\"I suppose you think I forgot to. Have _you_ checked it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have. I may not know much math, but I did check it.\"\n\n\"Even after the Columbia boys said it was nonsense? Well, does it come\nout right?\"\n\n\"No, it doesn't! You multiply the inverted matrix by the original and\nyou not only don't get zeros for all elements outside the diagonal,\nyou get a haphazard assortment of ones and twos. Worse still, every\nelement in the diagonal comes out equal to zero. The product of the two\nmatrices is about as different from the identity matrix as anything\ncould be. You're one of our most brilliant mathematicians--how could\nyou manage to make so many mistakes in one set of calculations?\"\n\n\"Did I tell you that was an inverted matrix? Maybe, for this problem,\nyou need something a little more advanced than algebra. Anyhow, if my\nmath is all wrong, why did your first report okay it?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, my first report?\"\n\n\"The one you sent to Prexy. The one you later called in and burned.\nExcept Prexy showed it to me and I photostated it. Here.\" Rothman\nreached into the pile of papers on his desk and drew out a little\nenvelope. It contained photographic prints. He held one before Avery's\nglasses. \"Does that look familiar?\"\n\nAvery drew his hand across his forehead, but did not reply.\n\n\"Is that true, Avery?\" asked MacPherson. \"Did you make a report okaying\nRothman's calculations and then withdraw it?\"\n\n\"Well, what if I did? The report didn't seem to make me much more\npopular than Rothman was. What if some very influential people in\nGovernment explained to Prexy, and he explained to me, just how\nunpopular that first report might make me? Or suppose they didn't.\nMaybe I simply didn't find the mistakes in the math until later.\" Avery\nkept looking at his cards as he spoke.\n\n\"Oh, great,\" said MacPherson. \"Rothman gets put away here, Neill and\nI lose our jobs, and there's hell to pay in Washington, all because\nAvery says Rothman's math is full of holes. Now it turns out he wasn't\nsure and maybe was pressured into it. Grand. Between a screwball and a\nskunk, I'll choose the screwball. Maybe if Avery had stuck to his guns,\nthere wouldn't have been any test.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" said Rothman. \"Avery was probably warned to mend\nhis ways. I was. Or maybe he couldn't face the truth. I'm sure he's\nbeen much happier, the last few months, believing I'm crazy. Anyway,\nI don't blame him any more. Maybe my math will soon speak for itself.\nFor your benefit--\" he turned to Avery--\"I may point out that the\nerrors you said you found affect only the _velocity_ of the wave of\ndisintegration. So what if that isn't quite right? The proof that the\nreaction will be self-sustaining is independent of that.\"\n\nAvery was white with rage. \"The proof, as you called it, that the\nreaction will be self-sustaining and will consume the entire substance\nof the Earth doesn't make sense, either. You used D as an operator\nwhere it should have been a constant. That's what finally made them\ncertain that you were insane.\"\n\nThere was a rap at the door and Joe poked his head in. \"Lunch,\nProfessors! Twelve o'clock, high noon, like they say. How about some\nturkey sandwiches?\"\n\nMacPherson began to sweat; the thought of food made him feel sick.\n\nWas it possible, he wondered, that in spite of everything, he was not\nquite sure? He looked at Neill and Avery, but they had turned their\nheads away.\n\n\"We won't bother with lunch, Joe,\" said Rothman.\n\n\"Must be a pretty good game if you won't even knock off to eat,\" said\nJoe. \"Well, will you at least mark your menu for tomorrow?\"\n\n\"For tomorrow? Tomorrow isn't going to come, you know.\"\n\n\"Nuts,\" muttered Joe as he closed and locked the door. \"Pure nuts.\"\n\nAvery cleared his throat, and his voice was thin. \"Look here, Rothman!\nIf the Universe were composed of matter as unstable as you claim,\nit would have ceased to exist long ago. Somewhere, somehow, in the\ninfinity of chance events since the creation of the Earth, something\nwould have occurred to start the self-sustaining chain reaction, and\nall matter would have been annihilated.\"\n\n\"Are you trying to prove something to yourself?\" asked Rothman. \"Surely\nyou don't equate infinity with a mere four billion years. That's\na finite time--long enough for the more dangerous radioactives to\ndisappear completely, of course, but not long enough for all possible\nchance events to have taken place. Anyway, I never have asserted that\nthe reaction would reach from Earth to the other planets, or even to\nthe Moon. The Universe, including the Solar System, will still go on.\nBut our old Earth is going up like a pile of magnesium powder mixed\nwith potassium chlorate when you drop a lighted match on it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAvery wiped his forehead. \"I don't know why I keep arguing with\na lunatic. But you know yourself that the value you give for the\nintegration constant in those equations is a pure guess, only you\nspend ten pages of doubletalk trying to hide that fact. If the constant\nis the one you give, why, sure, then you get a chain reaction. But\nyou made it up! Who ever heard of a constant of that magnitude in the\nsolution of an ordinary differential equation?\"\n\n\"That's one criticism of my work the Harvard and Columbia boys never\nmentioned.\"\n\n\"Okay, then I mention it. You're crazy!\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Positive!\"\n\n\"Then why can't you forget the approach of zero hour? I'll tell you\nwhy and you aren't even making a good show of hiding it. You know\nthat, compared to mine, your knowledge of mathematics is about on a\nlevel with that of a college sophomore. Deep down, you know that my\ncalculations were correct. You are convinced--_convinced_--that the\nbombing of Waaku has already started a chain reaction. And that about\nseventeen minutes past twelve, around eight minutes from now, the shock\nwave will reach us, and then the wave of disintegration. Look out of\nthe window! See that cactus in the sand, with its little yellow flower?\nIt will be annihilated. All that desert will go, too--every pebble,\nevery grain of sand. Everything you see, and you yourself, will be\ndisintegrated, transformed into energy!\"\n\nSuddenly he relaxed into a grin and softened his voice. \"I thought we\nwere playing poker. We're waiting for you to bet. Why don't you at\nleast look at your cards?\"\n\nAvery opened his mouth, then closed it, and picked up his hand,\nriffling the five cards.\n\n\"I'm staying,\" he said. \"Here's your blue and I raise you a blue.\"\n\nSlowly the others picked up their hands and stared at the cards.\nMacPherson scarcely looked at his as he spoke.\n\n\"I'm staying.\" He picked up the deck. \"Cards, gentlemen?\"\n\nRothman shook his head. \"I'll play these.\"\n\nNeill took two. \"I like to hold a kicker,\" he explained.\n\nAvery and MacPherson drew three.\n\n\"I opened,\" said Rothman, \"and I'll bet five blue chips.\"\n\n\"See you and raise you a blue,\" Neill said.\n\n\"I'll string along,\" said Avery.\n\nMacPherson threw his hand in. \"I'll let you guys fight it out.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey all looked at Rothman, who was studying his cards.\n\n\"I'll see you,\" he began, and paused. Then he shoved all of his chips\ninto the pot. \"I'll see you and raise you a hundred blue chips.\"\n\n\"Damn it Rothman!\" MacPherson protested. \"I know we agreed on no\nlimit, but if you go on playing like this, you'll lose more than you\ncan afford.\"\n\n\"I've already lost everything,\" said Rothman, \"and so have you. Don't\nyou know what time it is? In a few minutes, none of you will be around\nto try to collect. What time is it now?\"\n\nAvery reached for his watch, then stopped.\n\nRothman turned his head. \"What's that?\"\n\nNobody moved.\n\nA noise like the roar of a swift freight train rushed into the\nroom, rattling the windows. The walls shook, the floor trembled, the\nslide-rule slid off the pile of books and clattered to the floor.\n\nThey jumped to their feet and Avery ran to the window, clutching at the\nbars.\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Rothman calmly. \"The cactus plant will still be there,\ncasting its little shadow. You might as well sit down and finish the\ngame. That was only the shock wave. Have you forgotten that it is\ntransmitted through the Earth faster than the wave of disintegration?\nWe still have a few minutes left. Isn't anybody going to see my bet?\"\n\nAvery lurched to the desk, grabbed a remnant of torn paper and\nscribbled on it\n\n\"I'll see you,\" he yelled, \"and raise you a hundred and twenty-five\nbillion blues!\"\n\nMacPherson walked to the window. \"Look at the sky. This is it.\"\n\nThey all jammed against his back, trying to see the horizon, waiting.\nAvery dropped the scrap of paper and covered his eyes.\n\n\"What is there to see?\" Neill whispered.\n\n\"I thought--there was a flash....\" MacPherson's voice trailed off, and\nhe rubbed his eyes.\n\n\"But I didn't see anything,\" said Neill. \"There's nothing to see.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA minute went by. The desert remained calm, the blue sky was unmarked\nby even a cloud, the air was still.\n\nA second minute went by.\n\nNeill drew out his watch, looked wonderingly at the steady march of\nthe second hand. Then he turned and stumbled into the lavatory. They\ncould hear his dry heaves.\n\nRothman's eyes wavered from MacPherson to Avery, and back to\nMacPherson, and he sighed.\n\n\"Looks as if I was wrong, gentlemen,\" he said. \"Maybe I am crazy, after\nall. I wonder if that integration constant could have been wrong.\" He\nreached down to the floor to pick up the fallen slide-rule, sat down\nand drew a pad of paper toward him.\n\nMacPherson leaned against the window, too weak to move. He saw Avery\ntake his hands away from his eyes. He could hear the chattering of\nAvery's teeth, could hear them click as he clamped them together,\ntrying to control his lips. It seemed a long time before Avery managed\nto speak.\n\n\"_You!_\" cried Avery. He lunged forward, grabbed Rothman by the\nshoulder and jerked him to his feet. \"This--will teach you--not to\nmake--mistakes--\"\n\nHe smashed his fist into Rothman's face.\n\nStill MacPherson could not move, could not even shout. He could only\nlisten to Avery.\n\n\"And this will teach you--not to set up matrices--that don't\nmultiply--that burn up--the world--\"\n\nAgain Avery struck and knocked Rothman to the floor.\n\nBreaking through his paralysis, MacPherson clutched Avery by the\nshoulder, but Avery kicked at the man on the floor, again and again.\n\n\"Avery!\" shouted MacPherson. \"Snap out of it, man! It's all over! The\ntest is finished. We're still here. Rothman was wrong, just as we\nalways knew he was!\"\n\nBut Avery was on his knees, pounding Rothman with both fists, sobbing\nout meaningless words, oblivious to the shouts outside and to\nMacPherson's tugging.\n\nThe door burst open and Joe rushed in, followed by two other attendants.\n\n\"What goes on?\" After a glance at Avery's contorted face, Joe grabbed\nfor his legs. \"Send for the doc, boys. We're going to need help.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the men ran down the corridor while Joe and the others succeeded\nin pulling Avery away from Rothman, who struggled to his feet. A doctor\ncame in with a loaded hypodermic. He gave Avery an injection in the arm.\n\n\"Go easy there,\" said MacPherson. \"He'll be all right in a few minutes.\nHe's had a shock, that's all.\"\n\n\"Shock,\" Avery mumbled.\n\nMacPherson gripped Avery's arm. \"Try to relax, man. It's finished. We\nnever believed in it, of course. But I'll admit it's a relief, even to\nme, to be _sure_ there was no danger of a chain reaction at all.\"\n\nSuddenly he felt cold.\n\nThere was no understanding in Avery's eyes. He slumped to the floor.\n\n\"Do you think he'll be all right when he comes out from under the\ndrug?\" asked MacPherson.\n\n\"I can't say,\" said the doctor. \"I only saw him a few minutes, when\nyou came here this morning. I thought at the time he was pretty\ndisturbed. Much more than Rothman here. Next week, I think, we're going\nto send Rothman home.\"\n\nRothman wiped the blood off his chin and grinned weakly. \"You don't\nmean that, Doc. I used the wrong integration constant in a little\ncalculation. I must be crazy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Chain Reaction, by Boyd Ellanby\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CHAIN REACTION ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51255.txt or 51255.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/2/5/51255/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
