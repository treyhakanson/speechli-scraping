If Pyrrus wasn't it ... it was an awfully\n    good approximation!_\n\n\nJason dinAlt sprawled in soft luxury on the couch, a large frosty stein\nheld limply in one hand. His other hand rested casually on a pillow. The\ngun behind the pillow was within easy reach of his fingers. In his line\nof work he never took chances.\n\nIt was all highly suspicious. Jason didn't know a soul on this planet.\nYet the card sent by service tube from the hotel desk had read: _Kerk\nPyrrus would like to see Jason dinAlt_. Blunt and to the point. He\nsignaled the desk to send the man up, then lowered his fingers a bit\nuntil they brushed the gun butt. The door slid open and his visitor\nstepped through.\n\n_A retired wrestler._ That was Jason's first thought. Kerk Pyrrus was a\ngray-haired rock of a man. His body seemingly chiseled out of flat slabs\nof muscle. Then Jason saw the gun strapped to the inside of the other\nman's forearm, and he let his fingers drop casually behind the pillow.\n\n\"I'd appreciate it,\" Jason said, \"if you'd take off your gun while\nyou're in here.\" The other man stopped and scowled down at the gun as if\nhe was seeing it for the first time.\n\n\"No, I never take it off.\" He seemed mildly annoyed by the suggestion.\n\nJason had his fingers on his own gun when he said, \"I'm afraid I'll have\nto insist. I always feel a little uncomfortable around people who wear\nguns.\" He kept talking to distract attention while he pulled out his\ngun. Fast and smooth.\n\nHe could have been moving in slow motion for all the difference it made.\nKerk Pyrrus stood rock still while the gun came out, while it swung in\nhis direction. Not until the very last instant did he act. When he did,\nthe motion wasn't visible. First his gun was in the arm holster--then it\nwas aimed between Jason's eyes. It was an ugly, heavy weapon with a\npitted front orifice that showed plenty of use.\n\nAnd Jason knew if he swung his own weapon up a fraction of an inch more\nhe would be dead. He dropped his arm carefully and Kerk flipped his own\ngun back in the holster with the same ease he had drawn it.\n\n\"Now,\" the stranger said, \"if we're through playing, let's get down to\nbusiness. I have a proposition for you.\"\n\nJason downed a large mouthful from the mug and bridled his temper. He\nwas fast with a gun--his life had depended on it more than once--and\nthis was the first time he had been outdrawn. It was the offhand,\nunimportant manner it had been done that irritated him.\n\n\"I'm not prepared to do business,\" he said acidly. \"I've come to\nCassylia for a vacation, get away from work.\"\n\n\"Let's not fool each other, dinAlt,\" Kerk said impatiently. \"You've\nnever worked at an honest job in your entire life. You're a professional\ngambler and that's why I'm here to see you.\"\n\nJason forced down his anger and threw the gun to the other end of the\ncouch so he wouldn't be tempted to commit suicide. He _had_ hoped no\none knew him on Cassylia and was looking forward to a big kill at the\nCasino. He would worry about that later. This weight-lifter type seemed\nto know all the answers. Let him plot the course for a while and see\nwhere it led.\n\n\"All right, what do you want?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKerk dropped into a chair that creaked ominously under his weight, and\ndug an envelope out of one pocket. He flipped through it quickly and\ndropped a handful of gleaming Galactic Exchange notes onto the table.\nJason glanced at them--then sat up suddenly.\n\n\"What are they--forgeries?\" he asked, holding one up to the light.\n\n\"They're real enough,\" Kerk told him, \"I picked them up at the bank.\nExactly twenty-seven bills--or twenty-seven million credits. I want you\nto use them as a bankroll when you go to the Casino tonight. Gamble with\nthem and win.\"\n\nThey looked real enough--and they could be checked. Jason fingered them\nthoughtfully while he examined the other man.\n\n\"I don't know what you have in mind,\" he said. \"But you realize I can't\nmake any guarantees. I gamble--but I don't always win ...\"\n\n\"You gamble--and you win when you want to,\" Kerk said grimly. \"We looked\ninto that quite carefully before I came to you.\"\n\n\"If you mean to say that I cheat--\" Carefully, Jason grabbed his temper\nagain and held it down. There was no future in getting annoyed.\n\nKerk continued in the same level voice, ignoring Jason's growing anger.\n\"Maybe you don't call it cheating, frankly I don't care. As far as I'm\nconcerned you could have your suit lined with aces and electromagnets in\nyour boots. As long as you _won_. I'm not here to discuss moral points\nwith you. I said I had a proposition.\n\n\"We have worked hard for that money--but it still isn't enough. To be\nprecise, we need three billion credits. The only way to get that sum is\nby gambling--with these twenty-seven million as bankroll.\"\n\n\"And what do I get out of it?\" Jason asked the question coolly, as if\nany bit of the fantastic proposition made sense.\n\n\"Everything above the three billion you can keep, that should be fair\nenough. You're not risking your own money, but you stand to make enough\nto keep you for life if you win.\"\n\n\"And if I lose--?\"\n\nKerk thought for a moment, not liking the taste of the idea. \"Yes--there\nis the chance you might lose, I hadn't thought about that.\"\n\nHe reached a decision. \"If you lose--well I suppose that is just a risk\nwe will have to take. Though I think I would kill you then. The ones who\ndied to get the twenty-seven million deserve at least that.\" He said it\nquietly, without malice, and it was more of a promise than a threat.\n\nStamping to his feet Jason refilled his stein and offered one to Kerk\nwho took it with a nod of thanks. He paced back and forth, unable to\nsit. The whole proposition made him angry--yet at the same time had a\nfatal fascination. He was a gambler and this talk was like the taste of\ndrugs to an addict.\n\nStopping suddenly, he realized that his mind had been made up for some\ntime. Win or lose--live or die--how could he say no to the chance to\ngamble with money like that! He turned suddenly and jabbed his finger at\nthe big man in the chair.\n\n\"I'll do it--you probably knew I would from the time you came in here.\nThere are some terms of my own, though. I want to know who you are, and\nwho _they_ are you keep talking about. And where did the money come\nfrom. Is it stolen?\"\n\nKerk drained his own stein and pushed it away from him.\n\n\"Stolen money? No, quite the opposite. Two years' work mining and\nrefining ore to get it. It was mined on Pyrrus and sold here on\nCassylia. You can check on that very easily. I sold it. I'm the Pyrric\nambassador to this planet.\" He smiled at the thought. \"Not that that\nmeans much, I'm ambassador to at least six other planets as well. Comes\nin handy when you want to do business.\"\n\nJason looked at the muscular man with his gray hair and worn,\nmilitary-cut clothes, and decided not to laugh. You heard of strange\nthings out in the frontier planets and every word could be true. He had\nnever heard of Pyrrus either, though that didn't mean anything. There\nwere over thirty-thousand known planets in the inhabited universe.\n\n\"I'll check on what you have told me,\" Jason said. \"If it's true, we can\ndo business. Call me tomorrow--\"\n\n\"No,\" Kerk said. \"The money has to be won tonight. I've already issued a\ncheck for this twenty-seven million, it will bounce as high as the\nPleiades unless we deposit the money in the morning, so that's our time\nlimit.\"\n\nWith each moment the whole affair became more fantastic--and more\nintriguing for Jason. He looked at his watch. There was still enough\ntime to find out if Kerk was lying or not.\n\n\"All right, we'll do it tonight,\" he said. \"Only I'll have to have one\nof those bills to check.\"\n\nKerk stood up to go. \"Take them all, I won't be seeing you again until\nafter you've won. I'll be at the Casino of course, but don't recognize\nme. It would be much better if they didn't know where your money was\ncoming from or how much you had.\"\n\nThen he was gone, after a bone-crushing handclasp that closed on Jason's\nhand like vise jaws. Jason was alone with the money. Fanning the bills\nout like a hand of cards he stared at their sepia and gold faces, trying\nto get the reality through his head. Twenty-seven million credits. What\nwas to stop him from just walking out the door with them and vanishing.\nNothing really, except his own sense of honor.\n\nKerk Pyrrus, the man with the same last name as the planet he came\nfrom, was the universe's biggest fool. Or he knew just what he was\ndoing. From the way the interview had gone the latter seemed the better\nbet.\n\n\"He _knows_ I would much rather gamble with the money than steal it,\" he\nsaid wryly.\n\nSlipping a small gun into his waistband holster and pocketing the money\nhe went out.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nThe robot teller at the bank just pinged with electronic shock when he\npresented one of the bills and flashed a panel that directed him to see\nVice President Wain. Wain was a smooth customer who bugged his eyes and\nlost some of his tan when he saw the sheaf of bills.\n\n\"You ... wish to deposit these with us?\" he asked while his fingers\nunconsciously stroked them.\n\n\"Not today,\" Jason said. \"They were paid to me as a debt. Would you\nplease check that they are authentic and change them? I'd like five\nhundred thousand credit notes.\"\n\nBoth of his inner chest pockets were packed tight when he left the bank.\nThe bills were good and he felt like a walking mint. This was the first\ntime in his entire life that carrying a large sum of money made him\nuncomfortable. Waving to a passing helicab he went directly to the\nCasino, where he knew he would be safe--for a while.\n\nCassylia Casino was the playspot of the nearby cluster of star systems.\nIt was the first time Jason had seen it, though he knew its type well.\nHe had spent most of his adult life in casinos like this on other\nworlds. The decor differed but they were always the same. Gambling and\nsocialities in public--and behind the scenes all the private vice you\ncould afford. Theoretically no-limit games, but that was true only up to\na certain point. When the house was really hurt the honest games stopped\nbeing square and the big winner had to watch his step very carefully.\nThese were the odds Jason dinAlt had played against countless times\nbefore. He was wary but not very concerned.\n\nThe dining room was almost empty and the major-domo quickly rushed to\nthe side of the relaxed stranger in the richly cut clothes. Jason was\nlean and dark, looking more like the bored scion of some rich family\nthan a professional gambler. This appearance was important and he\ncultivated it. The cuisine looked good and the cellar turned out to be\nwonderful. He had a professional talk with the sommelier while waiting\nfor the soup, then settled down to enjoy his meal.\n\nHe ate leisurely and the large dining room was filled before he was\nthrough. Watching the entertainment over a long cigar killed some more\ntime. When he finally went to the gaming rooms they were filled and\nactive.\n\nMoving slowly around the room he dropped a few thousand credits. He\nscarcely noticed how he played, giving more attention to the feel of the\ngames. The play all seemed honest and none of the equipment was rigged.\nThat could be changed very quickly, he realized. Usually it wasn't\nnecessary, house percentage was enough to assure a profit.\n\nOnce he saw Kerk out of the corner of his eye but he paid him no\nattention. The ambassador was losing small sums steadily at\nseven-and-silver and seemed to be impatient. Probably waiting for Jason\nto begin playing seriously. He smiled and strolled on slowly.\n\nJason settled on the dice table as he usually did. It was the surest way\nto make small winnings. _And if I feel it tonight I can clean this\ncasino out!_ That was his secret, the power that won for him\nsteadily--and every once in a while enabled him to make a killing and\nmove on quickly before the hired thugs came to get the money back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dice reached him and he threw an eight the hard way. Betting was\nlight and he didn't push himself, just kept away from the sevens. He\nmade the point and passed a natural. Then he crapped out and the dice\nmoved on.\n\nSitting there, making small automatic bets while the dice went around\nthe table, he thought about the power. _Funny, after all the years of\nwork we still don't know much about_ psi. _They can train people a bit,\nand improve skills a bit--but that's all._\n\nHe was feeling strong tonight, he knew that the money in his pocket gave\nhim the extra lift that sometimes helped him break through. With his\neyes half closed he picked up the dice--and let his mind gently caress\nthe pattern of sunken dots. Then they shot out of his hand and he stared\nat a seven.\n\nIt was there.\n\nStronger than he had felt it in years. The stiff weight of those\nmillion-credit notes had done it. The world all around was sharp-cut\nclear and the dice was completely in his control. He knew to the\ntenth-credit how much the other players had in their wallets and was\naware of the cards in the hands of the players behind him.\n\nSlowly, carefully, he built up the stakes.\n\nThere was no effort to the dice, they rolled and sat up like trained\ndogs. Jason took his time and concentrated on the psychology of the\nplayers and the stick man. It took almost two hours to build his money\non the table to seven hundred thousand credits. Then he caught the stick\nman signaling they had a heavy winner. He waited until the hard-eyed man\nstrolled over to watch the game, then he smiled happily, bet all his\ntable stakes--and blew it on one roll of the dice. The house man smiled\nhappily, the stick man relaxed--and out of the corner of his eye Jason\nsaw Kerk turning a dark purple.\n\nSweating, pale, his hand trembling ever so slightly, Jason opened the\nfront of his jacket and pulled out one of the envelopes of new bills.\nBreaking the seal with his finger he dropped two of them on the table.\n\n\"Could we have a no-limit game?\" he asked, \"I'd like to--win back some\nof my money.\"\n\nThe stick man had trouble controlling his smile now, he glanced across\nat the house man who nodded a quick _yes_. They had a sucker and they\nmeant to clean him. He had been playing from his wallet all evening, now\nhe was cracking into a sealed envelope to try for what he had lost. A\nthick envelope too, and probably not his money. Not that the house cared\nin the least. To them money had no loyalties. The play went on with the\nCasino in a very relaxed mood.\n\nWhich was just the way Jason wanted it. He needed to get as deep into\nthem as he could before someone realized _they_ might be on the losing\nend. The rough stuff would start and he wanted to put it off as long as\npossible. It would be hard to win smoothly then--and his _psi_ power\nmight go as quickly as it had come. That had happened before.\n\nHe was playing against the house now, the two other players were obvious\nshills, and a crowd had jammed solidly around to watch. After losing and\nwinning a bit he hit a streak of naturals and his pile of gold chips\ntottered higher and higher. There was nearly a billion there, he\nestimated roughly. The dice were still falling true, though he was\nsoaked with sweat from the effort. Betting the entire stack of chips he\nreached for the dice. The stick man reached faster and hooked them away.\n\n\"House calls for new dice,\" he said flatly.\n\nJason straightened up and wiped his hands, glad of the instant's relief.\nThis was the third time the house had changed dice to try and break his\nwinning streak, it was their privilege. The hard-eyed Casino man opened\nhis wallet as he had done before and drew out a pair at random.\nStripping off their plastic cover he threw them the length of the table\nto Jason. They came up a natural seven and Jason smiled.\n\nWhen he scooped them up the smile slowly faded. The dice were\ntransparent, finely made, evenly weighted on all sides--and crooked.\n\nThe pigment on the dots of five sides of each die was some heavy metal\ncompound, probably lead. The sixth side was a ferrous compound. They\nwould roll true unless they hit a magnetic field--that meant the entire\nsurface of the table could be magnetized. He could never have spotted\nthe difference if he hadn't _looked_ at the dice with his mind. But what\ncould he do about it?\n\nShaking them slowly he glanced quickly around the table. There was what\nhe needed. An ashtray with a magnet in its base to hold it to the metal\nedge of the table. Jason stopped shaking the dice and looked at them\nquizzically, then reached over and grabbed the ashtray. He dropped the\nbase against his hand.\n\nAs he lifted the ashtray there was a concerted gasp from all sides. The\ndice were sticking there, upside down, box cars showing.\n\n\"Are these what you call honest dice?\" he asked.\n\nThe man who had thrown out the dice reached quickly for his hip pocket.\nJason was the only one who saw what happened next. He was watching that\nhand closely, his own fingers near his gun butt. As the man dived into\nhis pocket a hand reached out of the crowd behind him. From its\nsquare-cut size it could have belonged to only one person. The thick\nthumb and index finger clamped swiftly around the house man's wrist,\nthen they were gone. The man screamed shrilly and held up his arm, his\nhand dangling limp as a glove from the broken wrist bones.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith his flank well protected, Jason could go on with the game. \"The old\ndice if you don't mind,\" he said quietly.\n\nDazedly the stick man pushed them over. Jason shook quickly and rolled.\nBefore they hit the table he realized he couldn't control them--the\ntransient _psi_ power had gone.\n\nEnd over end they turned. And faced up seven.\n\nCounting the chips as they were pushed over to him he added up a bit\nunder two billion credits. They would be winning that much if he left\nthe game now--but it wasn't the three billion that Kerk needed. Well, it\nwould have to be enough. As he reached for the chips he caught Kerk's\neye across the table and the other man shook his head in a steady _no_.\n\n\"Let it ride,\" Jason said wearily, \"one more roll.\"\n\nHe breathed on the dice, polished them on his cuff, and wondered how he\nhad ever gotten into this spot. Billions riding on a pair of dice. That\nwas as much as the annual income of some planets. The only reason there\n_could_ be stakes like that was because the planetary government had a\nstake in the Casino. He shook as long as he could, reaching for the\ncontrol that wasn't there--then let fly.\n\nEverything else had stopped in the Casino and people were standing on\ntables and chairs to watch. There wasn't a sound from that large crowd.\nThe dice bounced back from the board with a clatter loud in the silence\nand tumbled over the cloth.\n\nA five and a one. Six. He still had to make his point. Scooping up the\ndice Jason talked to them, mumbled the ancient oaths that brought luck\nand threw again.\n\nIt took five throws before he made the six.\n\nThe crowd echoed his sigh and their voices rose quickly. He wanted to\nstop, take a deep breath, but he knew he couldn't. Winning the money was\nonly part of the job--they now had to get away with it. It had to look\ncasual. A waiter was passing with a tray of drinks. Jason stopped him\nand tucked a hundred-credit note in his pocket.\n\n\"Drinks are on me,\" he shouted while he pried the tray out of the\nwaiter's hands. Well-wishers cleared the filled glasses away quickly and\nJason piled the chips onto the tray. They more than loaded it, but Kerk\nappeared that moment with a second tray.\n\n\"I'll be glad to help you, sir, if you will permit me,\" he said.\n\nJason looked at him, and laughed permission. It was the first time he\nhad a clear look at Kerk in the Casino. He was wearing loose, purple\nevening pajamas over what must have been a false stomach. The sleeves\nwere long and baggy so he looked fat rather than muscular. It was a\nsimple but effective disguise.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCarefully carrying the loaded trays, surrounded by a crowd of excited\npatrons, they made their way to the cashier's window. The manager\nhimself was there, wearing a sickly grin. Even the grin faded when he\ncounted the chips.\n\n\"Could you come back in the morning,\" he said, \"I'm afraid we don't have\nthat kind of money on hand.\"\n\n\"What's the matter,\" Kerk shouted, \"trying to get out of paying him? You\ntook _my_ money easy enough when I lost--it works both ways!\"\n\nThe onlookers, always happy to see the house lose, growled their\ndisagreement. Jason finished the matter in a loud voice.\n\n\"I'll be reasonable, give me what cash you have and I'll take a check\nfor the balance.\"\n\nThere was no way out. Under the watchful eye of the gleeful crowd the\nmanager packed an envelope with bills and wrote a check. Jason took a\nquick glimpse at it, then stuffed it into an inside pocket. With the\nenvelope under one arm he followed Kerk towards the door.\n\nBecause of the onlookers there was no trouble in the main room, but just\nas they reached the side entrance two men moved in, blocking the way.\n\n\"Just a moment--\" one said. He never finished the sentence. Kerk walked\ninto them without slowing and they bounced away like tenpins. Then Kerk\nand Jason were out of the building and walking fast.\n\n\"Into the parking lot,\" Kerk said. \"I have a car there.\"\n\nWhen they rounded the corner there was a car bearing down on them.\nBefore Jason could get his gun clear of the holster Kerk was in front of\nhim. His arm came up and his big ugly gun burst through the cloth of his\nsleeve and jumped into his hand. A single shot killed the driver and the\ncar swerved and crashed. The other two men in the car died coming out of\nthe door, their guns dropping from their hands.\n\nAfter that they had no trouble. Kerk drove at top speed away from the\nCasino, the torn sleeve of his pajamas whipping in the breeze, giving\nglimpses of the big gun back in the holster.\n\n\"When you get the chance,\" Jason said, \"you'll have to show me how that\ntrick holster works.\"\n\n\"When we get the chance,\" Kerk answered as he dived the car into the\ncity access tube.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nThe building they stopped at was one of the finer residences in\nCassylia. As they had driven, Jason counted the money and separated his\nshare. Almost sixteen million credits. It still didn't seem quite real.\nWhen they got out in front of the building he gave Kerk the rest.\n\n\"Here's your three billion, don't think it was easy,\" he said.\n\n\"It could have been worse,\" was his only answer.\n\nThe recorded voice scratched in the speaker over the door.\n\n\"Sire Ellus has retired for the night, would you please call again in\nthe morning. All appointments are made in advan--\"\n\nThe voice broke off as Kerk pushed the door open. He did it almost\neffortlessly with the flat of his hand. As they went in Jason looked at\nthe remnants of torn and twisted metal that hung in the lock and\nwondered again about his companion.\n\n_Strength--more than physical strength--he's like an elemental force. I\nhave the feeling that nothing can stop him._\n\nIt made him angry--and at the same time fascinated him. He didn't want\nout of the deal until he found out more about Kerk and his planet. And\n\"they\" who had died for the money he gambled.\n\nSire Ellus was old, balding and angry, not at all used to having his\nrest disturbed. His complaints stopped suddenly when Kerk threw the\nmoney down on the table.\n\n\"Is the ship being loaded yet, Ellus? Here's the balance due.\" Ellus\nonly fumbled the bills for a moment before he could answer Kerk's\nquestion.\n\n\"The ship--but, of course. We began loading when you gave us the\ndeposit. You'll have to excuse my confusion, this is a little irregular.\nWe never handle transactions of this size in cash.\"\n\n\"That's the way I like to do business,\" Kerk answered him, \"I've\ncanceled the deposit, this is the total sum. Now how about a receipt.\"\n\nEllus had made out the receipt before his senses returned. He held it\ntightly while he looked uncomfortably at the three billion spread out\nbefore him.\n\n\"Wait--I can't take it now, you'll have to return in the morning, to the\nbank. In normal business fashion,\" Ellus decided firmly.\n\nKerk reached over and gently drew the paper out of Ellus' hand.\n\n\"Thanks for the receipt,\" he said. \"I won't be here in the morning so\nthis will be satisfactory. And if you're worried about the money I\nsuggest you get in touch with some of your plant guards or private\npolice. You'll feel a lot safer.\"\n\nWhen they left through the shattered door Ellus was frantically dialing\nnumbers on his screen. Kerk answered Jason's next question before he\ncould ask it.\n\n\"I imagine you would like to live to spend that money in your pocket, so\nI've booked two seats on an interplanetary ship,\" he glanced at the car\nclock. \"It leaves in about two hours so we have plenty of time. I'm\nhungry, let's find a restaurant. I hope you have nothing at the hotel\nworth going back for. It would be a little difficult.\"\n\n\"Nothing worth getting killed for,\" Jason said. \"Now where can we go to\neat--there are a few questions I would like to ask you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey circled carefully down to the transport levels until they were sure\nthey hadn't been followed. Kerk nosed the car into a darkened loading\ndock where they abandoned it.\n\n\"We can always get another car,\" he said, \"and they probably have this\none spotted. Let's walk back to the freightway, I saw a restaurant there\nas we came by.\"\n\nDark and looming shapes of overland freight carriers filled the parking\nlot. They picked their way around the man-high wheels and into the hot\nand noisy restaurant. The drivers and early morning workers took no\nnotice of them as they found a booth in the back and dialed a meal.\n\nKerk chiseled a chunk of meat off the slab in front of him and popped it\ncheerfully into his mouth. \"Ask your questions,\" he said. \"I'm feeling\nmuch better already.\"\n\n\"What's in this ship you arranged for tonight--what kind of a cargo was\nI risking my neck for?\"\n\n\"I thought you were risking your neck for money,\" Kerk said dryly. \"But\nbe assured it was in a good cause. That cargo means the survival of a\nworld. Guns, ammunition, mines, explosives and such.\"\n\nJason choked over a mouthful of food. \"Gun-running! What are you doing,\nfinancing a private war? And how can you talk about survival with a\nlethal cargo like that? Don't try and tell me they have a peaceful use.\nWho are you killing?\"\n\nMost of the big man's humor had vanished, he had that grim look Jason\nknew well.\n\n\"Yes, peaceful would be the right word. Because that is basically all we\nwant. Just to live in peace. And it is not _who_ are we killing--it is\n_what_ we are killing.\"\n\nJason pushed his plate away with an angry gesture. \"You're talking in\nriddles,\" he said. \"What you say has no meaning.\"\n\n\"It has meaning enough,\" Kerk told him, \"but only on one planet in the\nuniverse. Just how much do you know about Pyrrus?\"\n\n\"Absolutely nothing.\"\n\nFor a moment Kerk sat wrapped in memory, scowling distantly. Then he\nwent on.\n\n\"Mankind doesn't belong on Pyrrus--yet has been there for almost three\nhundred years now. The age expectancy of my people is sixteen years. Of\ncourse most adults live beyond that, but the high child mortality brings\nthe average down.\n\n\"It is everything that a humanoid world should not be. The gravity is\nnearly twice Earth normal. The temperature can vary daily from arctic to\ntropic. The climate--well you have to experience it to believe it. Like\nnothing you've seen anywhere else in the galaxy.\"\n\n\"I'm frightened,\" Jason said dryly. \"What do you have--methane or\nchlorine reactions? I've been down on planets like that--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKerk slammed his hand down hard on the table. The dishes bounced and the\ntable legs creaked. \"Laboratory reactions!\" he growled. \"They look great\non a bench--but what happens when you have a world filled with those\ncompounds? In an eye-wink of galactic time all the violence is locked up\nin nice, stable compounds. The atmosphere may be poisonous for an oxygen\nbreather, but taken by itself it's as harmless as weak beer.\n\n\"There is only one setup that is pure poison as a planetary atmosphere.\nPlenty of H{2}O, the most universal solvent you can find, plus free\noxygen to work on--\"\n\n\"Water and oxygen!\" Jason broke in. \"You mean Earth--or a planet like\nCassylia here? That's preposterous.\"\n\n\"Not at all. Because you were born in this kind of environment you\naccept it as right and natural. You take it for granted that metals\ncorrode, coastlines change, and storms interfere with communication.\nThese are normal occurrences on oxygen-water worlds. On Pyrrus these\nconditions are carried to the nth degree.\n\n\"The planet has an axial tilt of almost forty-two degrees, so there is a\ntremendous change in temperature from season to season. This is one of\nthe prime causes of a constantly changing icecap. The weather generated\nby this is spectacular to say the least.\"\n\n\"If that's all,\" Jason said, \"I don't see why--\"\n\n\"That's _not_ all--it's barely the beginning. The open seas perform the\ndual destructive function of supplying water vapor to keep the weather\ngoing, and building up gigantic tides. Pyrrus' two satellites, Samas and\nBessos, combine at times to pull the oceans up into thirty meter tides.\nAnd until you've seen one of these tides lap over into an active volcano\nyou've seen nothing.\n\n\"Heavy elements are what brought us to Pyrrus--and these same elements\nkeep the planet at a volcanic boil. There have been at least thirteen\nsuper-novas in the immediate stellar neighborhood. Heavy elements can be\nfound on most of their planets of course--as well as completely\nunbreathable atmospheres. Long-term mining and exploitation can't be\ndone by anything but a self-sustaining colony. Which meant Pyrrus. Where\nthe radioactive elements are locked in the planetary core, surrounded by\na shell of lighter ones. While this allows for the atmosphere men need,\nit also provides unceasing volcanic activity as the molten plasma forces\nits way to the surface.\"\n\nFor the first time Jason was silent. Trying to imagine what life could\nbe like on a planet constantly at war with itself.\n\n\"I've saved the best for last,\" Kerk said with grim humor. \"Now that you\nhave an idea of what the environment is like--think of the kind of life\nforms that would populate it. I doubt if there is one off-world species\nthat would live a minute. Plants and animals on Pyrrus are _tough_. They\nfight the world and they fight each other. Hundreds of thousands of\nyears of genetic weeding-out have produced things that would give even\nan electronic brain nightmares. Armor-plated, poisonous, claw-tipped and\nfanged-mouthed. That describes everything that walks, flaps or just sits\nand grows. Ever see a plant with teeth--that bite? I don't think you\nwant to. You'd have to be on Pyrrus and that means you would be dead\nwithin seconds of leaving the ship. Even I'll have to take a refresher\ncourse before I'll be able to go outside the landing buildings. The\nunending war for survival keeps the life forms competing and changing.\nDeath is simple, but the ways of dealing it too numerous to list.\"\n\nUnhappiness rode like a weight on Kerk's broad shoulders. After long\nmoments of thought he moved visibly to shake it off. Returning his\nattention to his food and mopping the gravy from his plate, he voiced\npart of his feelings.\n\n\"I suppose there is no logical reason why we should stay and fight this\nendless war. Except that Pyrrus is our home.\" The last piece of\ngravy-soaked bread vanished and he waved the empty fork at Jason.\n\n\"Be happy you're an off-worlder and will never have to see it.\"\n\n\"That's where you're wrong.\" Jason said as calmly as he could. \"You see,\nI'm going back with you.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\"Don't talk stupidly,\" Kerk said as he punched for a duplicate order of\nsteak. \"There are much simpler ways of committing suicide. Don't you\nrealize that you're a millionaire now? With what you have in your pocket\nyou can relax the rest of your life on the pleasure planets. Pyrrus is a\ndeath world, not a sightseeing spot for jaded tourists. I cannot permit\nyou to return with me.\"\n\nGamblers who lose their tempers don't last long. Jason was angry now.\nYet it showed only in a negative way. In the lack of expression on his\nface and the calmness of his voice.\n\n\"Don't tell me what I can or cannot do, Kerk Pyrrus. You're a big man\nwith a fast gun--but that doesn't make you my boss. All you can do is\nstop me from going back on your ship. But I can easily afford to get\nthere another way. And don't try to tell me I want to go to Pyrrus for\nsightseeing when you have no idea of my real reasons.\"\n\nJason didn't even try to explain his reasons, they were only half\nrealized and too personal. The more he traveled, the more things looked\nthe same to him. The old, civilized planets sank into a drab similarity.\nFrontier worlds all had the crude sameness of temporary camps in a\nforest. Not that the galactic worlds bored him. It was just that he had\nfound their limitations--yet had never found his own. Until he met Kerk\nhe had acknowledged no man his superior, or even his equal. This was\nmore than egotism. It was facing facts. Now he was forced to face the\nfact that there was a whole world of people who might be superior to\nhim. Jason could never rest content until he had been there and seen for\nhimself. Even if he died in the attempt.\n\nNone of this could be told to Kerk. There were other reasons he would\nunderstand better.\n\n\"You're not thinking ahead when you prevent me from going to Pyrrus,\"\nJason said. \"I'll not mention any moral debt you owe me for winning that\nmoney you needed. But what about the next time? If you needed that much\nlethal goods once, you'll probably need it again some day. Wouldn't it\nbe better to have me on hand--old tried and true--than dreaming up some\nnew and possibly unreliable scheme?\"\n\nKerk chewed pensively on the second serving of steak. \"That makes sense.\nAnd I must admit I hadn't thought of it before. One failing we Pyrrans\nhave is a lack of interest in the future. Staying alive day by day is\nenough trouble. So we tend to face emergencies as they arrive and let\nthe dim future take care of itself. You can come. I hope you will still\nbe alive when we need you. As Pyrran ambassador to a lot of places I\nofficially invite you to our planet. All expenses paid. On the condition\nyou obey completely all our instructions regarding your personal\nsafety.\"\n\n\"Conditions accepted,\" Jason said. And wondered why he was so cheerful\nabout signing his own death warrant.\n\nKerk was shoveling his way through his third dessert when his alarm\nwatch gave a tiny hum. He dropped his fork instantly and stood up. \"Time\nto go,\" he said. \"We're on schedule now.\" While Jason scrambled to his\nfeet, he jammed coins into the meter until the _paid_ light came on.\nThen they were out the door and walking fast.\n\nJason wasn't at all surprised when they came on a public escalator just\nbehind the restaurant. He was beginning to realize that since leaving\nthe Casino their every move had been carefully planned and timed.\nWithout a doubt the alarm was out and the entire planet being searched\nfor them. Yet so far they hadn't noticed the slightest sign of pursuit.\nThis wasn't the first time Jason had to move just one jump ahead of the\nauthorities--but it was the first time he had let someone else lead him\nby the hand while he did it. He had to smile at his own automatic\nagreement. He had been a loner for so many years that he found a certain\ninverse pleasure in following someone else.\n\n\"Hurry up,\" Kerk growled after a quick glance at his watch. He set a\nsteady, killing pace up the escalator steps. They went up five levels\nthat way--without seeing another person--before Kerk relented and let\nthe escalator do the work.\n\nJason prided himself on keeping in condition. But the sudden climb,\nafter the sleepless night, left him panting heavily and soaked with\nsweat. Kerk, cool of forehead and breathing normally, didn't show the\nslightest sign that he had been running.\n\nThey were at the second motor level when Kerk stepped off the slowly\nrising steps and waved Jason after him. As they came through the exit to\nthe street a car pulled up to the curb in front of them. Jason had\nenough sense not to reach for his gun. At the exact moment they reached\nthe car the driver opened the door and stepped out. Kerk passed him a\nslip of paper without saying a word and slipped in behind the wheel.\nThere was just time for Jason to jump in before the car pulled away. The\nentire transfer had taken less than three seconds.\n\nThere had been only a glimpse of the driver in the dim light, but Jason\nhad recognized him. Of course he had never seen the man before, but\nafter knowing Kerk he couldn't mistake the compact strength of a native\nPyrran.\n\n\"That was the receipt from Ellus you gave him,\" Jason said.\n\n\"Of course. That takes care of the ship and the cargo. They'll be\noff-planet and safely away before the casino check is traced to Ellus.\nSo now let's look after ourselves. I'll explain the plan in detail so\nthere will be no slip-ups on your part. I'll go through the whole thing\nonce and if there are any questions you'll ask them when I'm finished.\"\n\nThe tones of command were so automatic that Jason found himself\nlistening in quiet obedience. Though one part of his mind wanted him to\nsmile at the quick assumption of his incompetence.\n\nKerk swung the car into the steady line of traffic heading out of the\ncity to the spaceport. He drove easily while he talked.\n\n\"There is a search on in the city, but we're well ahead of that. I'm\nsure the Cassylians don't want to advertise their bad sportsmanship so\nthere won't be anything as crude as a roadblock. But the port will be\ncrawling with every agent they have. They know once the money gets\noff-planet it is gone forever. When we make a break for it they will be\nsure we still have the goods. So there will be no trouble with the\nmunition ship getting clear.\"\n\nJason sounded a little shocked. \"You mean you're setting us up as clay\npigeons to cover the take-off of the ship.\"\n\n\"You could put it that way. But since we have to get off-planet anyway,\nthere is no harm in using our escape as a smokescreen. Now shut up until\nI've finished, like I told you. One more interruption and I dump you by\nthe road.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJason was sure he would. He listened intently--and quietly--as Kerk\nrepeated word for word what he had said before, then continued.\n\n\"The official car gate will probably be wide open with the traffic\nthrough it. And a lot of the agents will be in plain clothes. We might\neven get onto the field without being recognized, though I doubt it. It\nis of no importance. We will drive through the gate and to the take-off\npad. The _Pride of Darkhan_, for which we hold tickets, will be sounding\nits two-minute siren and unhooking the gangway. By the time we get to\nour seats the ship will take off.\"\n\n\"That's all very fine,\" Jason said. \"But what will the guards be doing\nall this time?\"\n\n\"Shooting at us and each other. We will take advantage of the confusion\nto get aboard.\"\n\nThis answer did nothing to settle Jason's mind, but he let it slide for\nthe moment. \"All right--say we _do_ get aboard. Why don't they just\nprevent take-off until we have been dragged out and stood against a\nwall?\"\n\nKerk spared him a contemptuous glance before he returned his eyes to the\nroad. \"I said the ship was the _Pride of Darkhan_. If you had studied\nthis system at all, you would know what that means. Cassylia and Darkhan\nare sister planets and rivals in every way. It has been less than two\ncenturies since they fought an intra-system war that almost destroyed\nboth of them. Now they exist in an armed-to-the-teeth neutrality that\nneither dare violate. The moment we set foot aboard the ship we are on\nDarkhan territory. There is no extradition agreement between the\nplanets. Cassylia may want us--but not badly enough to start another\nwar.\"\n\nThat was all the explanation there was time for. Kerk swung the car out\nof the rush of traffic and onto a bridge marked _Official Cars Only_.\nJason had a feeling of nakedness as they rolled under the harsh port\nlights towards the guarded gate ahead.\n\nIt was closed.\n\nAnother car approached the gate from the inside and Kerk slowed their\ncar to a crawl. One of the guards talked to the driver of the car inside\nthe port, then waved to the gate attendant. The barrier gate began to\nswing inwards and Kerk jammed down on the accelerator.\n\nEverything happened at once. The turbine howled, the spinning tires\nscreeched on the road and the car crashed open the gate. Jason had a\nvanishing glimpse of the open-mouthed guards, then they were skidding\naround the corner of a building. A few shots popped after them, but none\ncame close.\n\nDriving with one hand, Kerk reached under the dash and pulled out a gun\nthat was the twin of the monster strapped to his arm. \"Use this instead\nof your own,\" he said. \"Rocket-propelled explosive slugs. Make a great\nbang. Don't bother shooting at anyone--I'll take care of that. Just stir\nup a little action and make them keep their distance. Like this.\"\n\nHe fired a single, snap-shot out the side window and passed the gun to\nJason almost before the slug hit. An empty truck blew up with a roar,\nraining pieces on the cars around and sending their drivers fleeing in\npanic.\n\nAfter that it was a nightmare ride through a madhouse. Kerk drove with\nan apparent contempt for violent death. Other cars followed them and\nwere lost in wheel-raising turns. They careened almost the full length\nof the field, leaving a trail of smoking chaos.\n\nThen the pursuit was all behind them and the only thing ahead was the\nslim spire of the _Pride of Darkhan_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Pride_ was surrounded by a strong wire fence as suited the\nbegrudged status of her planetary origin. The gate was closed and\nguarded by soldiers with leveled guns, waiting for a shot at the\napproaching car. Kerk made no attempt to come near them. Instead he fed\nthe last reserves of power to the car and headed for the fence. \"Cover\nyour face,\" he shouted.\n\nJason put his arms in front of his head just as they hit.\n\nTorn metal screamed, the fence buckled, wrapped itself around the car,\nbut did not break. Jason flew off the seat and into the padded dash. By\nthe time Kerk had the warped door open, he realized that the ride was\nover. Kerk must have seen the spin of his eyeballs because he didn't\ntalk, just pulled Jason out and threw him onto the hood of the ruined\ncar.\n\n\"Climb over the buckled wire and make a run for the ship,\" he shouted.\n\nIf there was any doubt what he meant, he set Jason an example of fine\nroadwork. It was inconceivable that someone of his bulk could run so\nfast, yet he did. He moved more like a charging tank than a man. Jason\nshook the fog from his head and worked up some speed himself.\nNevertheless, he was barely halfway to the ship when Kerk hit the\ngangway. It was already unhooked from the ship, but the shocked\nattendants stopped rolling it away as the big man bounded up the steps.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAt the top he turned and fired at the soldiers who were charging through\nthe open gate. They dropped, crawled, and returned his fire. Very few\nshot at Jason's running form.\n\nThe scene in front of Jason cranked over in slow motion. Kerk standing\nat the top of the ramp, coolly returning the fire that splashed all\nabout. He could have found safety in an instant through the open port\nbehind him. The only reason he stayed there was to cover Jason.\n\n\"Thanks--\" Jason managed to gasp as he made the last few steps up the\ngangway, jumped the gap and collapsed inside the ship.\n\n\"You're perfectly welcome,\" Kerk said as he joined him, waving his gun\nto cool it off.\n\nA grim-jawed ship's officer stood back out of range of fire from the\nground and looked them both up and down. \"And just what is going on\nhere?\" he growled.\n\nKerk tested the barrel with a wet thumb, then let the gun slide back\ninto its holster. \"We are law-abiding citizens of a different system who\nhave committed no criminal acts. The savages of Cassylia are too\nbarbarous for civilized company. Therefore we are going to Darkhan--here\nare our tickets--in whose sovereign territory I believe we are at this\nmoment.\" This last was added for the benefit of the Cassylian officer\nwho had just stumbled to the top of the gangway and was raising his gun.\n\nThe soldier couldn't be blamed. He saw these badly wanted criminals\ngetting away. Aboard a Darkhan ship as well. Anger got the best of him\nand he brought his gun up.\n\n\"Come out of there, you scum. You're not escaping that easily. Come out\nslow with your hands up or I'll blast you--\"\n\nIt was a frozen moment of time that stretched and stretched without\nbreaking. The pistol covered Kerk and Jason. Neither of them attempted\nto reach for their own guns.\n\nThe gun twitched a bit as the ship's officer moved, then steadied back\non the two men. The Darkhan spaceman hadn't gone far, just a pace across\nthe lock. This was enough to bring him next to a red box set flush with\nthe wall. With a single, swift gesture he flipped up the cover and\npoised his thumb over the button inside. When he smiled his lips peeled\nback to show all of his teeth. He had made up his mind, and it was the\narrogance of the Cassylian officer that had been the deciding factor.\n\n\"Fire a single shot into Darkhan territory and I press this button,\" he\nshouted. \"And you know what this button does--every one of your ships\nhas them as well. Commit a hostile act against this ship and _someone_\nwill press a button. Every control rod will be blown out of the ship's\npile at that instant and half your filthy city will go up in the\nexplosion.\" His smile was chiseled on his face and there was no doubt he\nwould do what he said. \"Go ahead--fire. I think I would enjoy pressing\nthis.\"\n\nThe take-off siren was hooting now, the _close lock_ light blinking an\nangry message from the bridge. Like four actors in a grim drama they\nfaced each other an instant more.\n\nThen the Cassylian officer, growling with unvoicable frustrated anger,\nturned and leaped back to the steps.\n\n\"All passengers board ship. Forty-five seconds to take-off. Clear the\nport.\" The ship's officer slammed shut the cover of the box and locked\nit as he talked. There was barely time to make the acceleration couches\nbefore the _Pride of Darkhan_ cleared ground.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nOnce the ship was in orbit the captain sent for Jason and Kerk. Kerk\ntook the floor and was completely frank about the previous night's\nactivities. The only fact of importance he left out was Jason's\nbackground as a professional gambler. He drew a beautiful picture of\ntwo lucky strangers whom the evil forces of Cassylia wanted to deprive\nof their gambling profits. All this fitted perfectly the captain's\npreconceptions of Cassylia. In the end he congratulated his officer on\nthe correctness of his actions and began the preparation of a long\nreport to his government. He gave the two men his best wishes as well as\nthe liberty of the ship.\n\nIt was a short trip. Jason barely had time to catch up on his sleep\nbefore they grounded on Darkhan. Being without luggage they were the\nfirst ones through customs. They left the shed just in time to see\nanother ship landing in a distant pit. Kerk stopped to watch it and\nJason followed his gaze. It was a gray, scarred ship. With the stubby\nlines of a freighter--but sporting as many guns as a cruiser.\n\n\"Yours, of course,\" Jason said.\n\nKerk nodded and started towards the ship. One of the locks opened as\nthey came up but no one appeared. Instead a remote-release folding\nladder rattled down to the ground. Kerk swarmed up it and Jason followed\nglumly. Somehow, he felt, this was overdoing the no-frills-and-nonsense\nattitude.\n\nJason was catching on to Pyrran ways though. The reception aboard ship\nfor the ambassador was just what he expected. Nothing. Kerk closed the\nlock himself and they found couches as the take-off horn sounded. The\nmain jets roared and acceleration smashed down on Jason.\n\nIt didn't stop. Instead it grew stronger, squeezing the air out of his\nlungs and the sight from his eyes. He screamed but couldn't hear his own\nvoice through the roaring in his ears. Mercifully he blacked out.\n\nWhen consciousness returned the ship was at zero-G. Jason kept his eyes\nclosed and let the pain seep out of his body. Kerk spoke suddenly, he\nwas standing next to the couch.\n\n\"My fault, Meta, I should have told you we had a 1-G passenger aboard.\nYou might have eased up a bit on your usual bone-breaking take-off.\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem to have harmed him much--but what's he doing here?\"\n\nJason felt mild surprise that the second voice was a girl's. But he\nwasn't interested enough to go to the trouble of opening his sore eyes.\n\n\"Going to Pyrrus. I tried to talk him out of it, of course, but I\ncouldn't change his mind. It's a shame, too, I would like to have done\nmore for him. He's the one who got the money for us.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's awful,\" the girl said. Jason wondered why it was _awful_. It\ndidn't make sense to his groggy mind. \"It would have been much better if\nhe stayed on Darkhan,\" the girl continued. \"He's very nice-looking. I\nthink it's a shame he has to die.\"\n\nThat was too much for Jason. He pried one eye open, then the other. The\nvoice belonged to a girl about twenty-one who was standing next to the\nbed, gazing down at Jason. She was beautiful.\n\nJason's eyes opened wider as he realized she was _very_ beautiful--with\nthe kind of beauty never found in the civilized galaxy. The women he had\nknown all ran to pale skin, hollow shoulders, gray faces covered with\ntints and dyes. They were the product of centuries of breeding\nweaknesses back into the race, as the advance of medicine kept alive\nmore and more non-survival types.\n\nThis girl was the direct opposite in every way. She was the product of\nsurvival on Pyrrus. The heavy gravity that produced bulging muscles in\nmen, brought out firm strength in straplike female muscles. She had the\nfigure of a goddess, tanned skin and perfectly formed face. Her hair,\nwhich was cut short, circled her head like a golden crown. The only\nunfeminine thing about her was the gun she wore in a bulky forearm\nholster. When she saw Jason's eyes open she smiled at him. Her teeth\nwere as even and as white as he had expected.\n\n\"I'm Meta, pilot of this ship. And you must be--\"\n\n\"Jason dinAlt. That was a lousy take-off, Meta.\"\n\n\"I'm really very sorry,\" she laughed. \"But being born on a two-G planet\ndoes make one a little immune to acceleration. I save fuel too, with the\nsynergy curve--\"\n\nKerk gave a noncommittal grunt. \"Come along, Meta, we'll take a look at\nthe cargo. Some of the new stuff will plug the gaps in the perimeter.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" she said, almost clapping her hands with happiness. \"I read\nthe specs, they're simply wonderful.\"\n\n_Like a schoolgirl with a new dress. Or a box of candy. That's a great\nattitude to have towards bombs and flame-throwers._ Jason smiled wryly\nat the thought as he groaned off the couch. The two Pyrrans had gone and\nhe pulled himself painfully through the door after them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt took him a long time to find his way to the hold. The ship was big\nand apparently empty of crew. Jason finally found a man sleeping in one\nof the brightly lit cabins. He recognized him as the driver who had\nturned the car over to them on Cassylia. The man, who had been sleeping\nsoundly a moment before, opened his eyes as soon as Jason drifted into\nthe room. He was wide awake.\n\n\"How do I get to the cargo hold?\" Jason asked.\n\nThe other told him, closed his eyes and went instantly back to sleep\nbefore Jason could even say thanks.\n\nIn the hold, Kerk and Meta had opened some of the crates and were\nchortling with joy over their lethal contents. Meta, a pressure canister\nin her arms, turned to Jason as he came through the door.\n\n\"Just look at this,\" she said. \"This powder in here--why you can eat it\nlike dirt, with less harm. Yet it is instantly deadly to all forms of\nvegetable life ...\" She stopped suddenly as she realized Jason didn't\nshare her extreme pleasure. \"I'm sorry. I forgot for a moment there that\nyou weren't a Pyrran. So you don't really understand, do you?\"\n\nBefore he could answer, the PA speaker called her name.\n\n\"Jump time,\" she said. \"Come with me to the bridge while I do the\nequations. We can talk there. I know so little about any place except\nPyrrus that I have a million questions to ask.\"\n\nJason followed her to the bridge where she relieved the duty officer and\nbegan taking readings for the jump-setting. She looked out of place\namong the machines, a sturdy but supple figure in a simple, one-piece\nshipsuit. Yet there was no denying the efficiency with which she went\nabout her job.\n\n\"Meta, aren't you a little young to be the pilot of an interstellar\nship?\"\n\n\"Am I?\" She thought for a second. \"I really don't know how old pilots\nare supposed to be. I have been piloting for about three years now and\nI'm almost twenty. Is that younger than usual?\"\n\nJason opened his mouth--then laughed. \"I suppose that all depends on\nwhat planet you're from. Some places you would have trouble getting\nlicensed. But I'll bet things are different on Pyrrus. By their\nstandards you must rank as an old lady.\"\n\n\"Now you're making a joke,\" Meta said serenely as she fed a figure into\nthe calculator. \"I've seen old ladies on some planets. They are wrinkled\nand have gray hair. I don't know how old they are, I asked one but she\nwouldn't tell me her age. But I'm sure they must be older than anyone on\nPyrrus, no one looks like that there.\"\n\n\"I don't mean old that way,\" Jason groped for the right word. \"Not\nold--but grown-up, mature. An adult.\"\n\n\"Everyone is grown-up,\" she answered. \"At least soon after they leave\nthe wards. And they do that when they're six. My first child is\ngrown-up, and the second one would be, too, only he's dead. So I\n_surely_ must be.\"\n\nThat seemed to settle the question for her, though Jason's thoughts\njumped with the alien concepts and background, inherent behind her\nwords.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeta punched in the last setting, and the course tape began to chunk out\nof the case. She turned her attention back to Jason. \"I'm glad you're\naboard this trip, though I am sorry you are going to Pyrrus. But we'll\nhave lots of time to talk. There are so many things I want to find out\nabout other planets, and why people go around acting the way they do.\nNot at all like home where you _know_ why people are doing things all\nthe time.\" She frowned over the tape for a moment, then turned her\nattention back to Jason. \"What is your home planet like?\"\n\nOne after another the usual lies he told people came to his lips, and\nwere pushed away. Why bother lying to a girl who really didn't care if\nyou were serf or noble? To her there were only two kinds of people in\nthe galaxy--Pyrrans, and the rest. For the first time since he had fled\nfrom Porgorstorsaand he found himself telling someone the truth of his\norigin.\n\n\"My home planet? Just about the stuffiest, dullest, dead-end in the\nuniverse. You can't believe the destructive decay of a planet that is\nmainly agrarian, caste-conscious and completely satisfied with its own\nboring existence. Not only is there no change--but no one _wants_\nchange. My father was a farmer, so I should have been a farmer too--if I\nhad listened to the advice of my betters. It was unthinkable, as well as\nforbidden for me to do anything else. And everything I wanted to do was\nagainst the law. I was fifteen before I learned to read--out of a book\nstolen from a noble school. After that there was no turning back. By the\ntime I stowed aboard an off-world freighter at nineteen I must have\nbroken every law on the planet. Happily. Leaving home for me was just\nlike getting out of prison.\"\n\nMeta shook her head at the thought. \"I just can't imagine a place like\nthat. But I'm sure I wouldn't like it there.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you wouldn't,\" Jason laughed. \"So once I was in space, with no\nlaw-abiding talents or skills, I just wandered into one thing and\nanother. In this age of technology I was completely out of place. Oh, I\nsuppose I could have done well in some army, but I'm not so good at\ntaking orders. Whenever I gambled I did well, so little by little I just\ndrifted into it. People are the same everywhere, so I manage to make out\nwell wherever I end up.\"\n\n\"I know what you mean about people being alike--but they are so\n_different_,\" she said. \"I'm not being clear at all, am I? What I mean\nis that at home I know what people will do and why they do it at the\nsame time. People on all the other planets do act alike, as you said,\nyet I have very much trouble understanding why. For instance, I like to\ntry the local food when we set down on a planet, and if there is time I\nalways do. There are bars and restaurants near every spaceport so I go\nthere. And I always have trouble with the men. They want to buy me\ndrinks, hold my hand--\"\n\n\"Well, a single girl in those port joints has to expect a certain amount\nof interest from the men.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know that,\" she said. \"What I don't understand is why they don't\nlisten when I tell them I am not interested and to go away. They just\nlaugh and pull up a chair, usually. But I have found that one thing\nworks wherever I am. I tell them if they don't stop bothering me I'll\nbreak their arm.\"\n\n\"Does that stop them?\" Jason asked.\n\n\"No, of course not. But after I break their arm they go away. And the\nothers don't bother me either. It's a lot of fuss to go through and the\nfood is usually awful.\"\n\nJason didn't laugh. Particularly when he realized that this girl _could_\nbreak the arm of any spaceport thug in the galaxy. She was a strange\nmixture of naivete and strength, unlike anyone he had ever met before.\nOnce again he realized that he _had_ to visit the planet that produced\npeople like her and Kerk.\n\n\"Tell me about Pyrrus,\" he asked. \"Why is it that you and Kerk assume\nautomatically that I will drop dead as soon as I land? What is the\nplanet like?\"\n\nAll the warmth was gone from her face now. \"I can't tell you. You will\nhave to see for yourself. I know that much after visiting some of the\nother worlds. Pyrrus is like nothing you galaxy people have ever\nexperienced. You won't really believe it until it is too late. Will you\npromise me something?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered. \"At least not until after I hear what it is and\ndecide.\"\n\n\"Don't leave the ship when we land. You _should_ be safe enough aboard,\nand I'll be flying a cargo out within a few weeks.\"\n\n\"I'll promise nothing of the sort. I'll leave when I want to leave.\"\nJason knew there was logic in her words, but his back was up at her\nautomatic superiority.\n\nMeta finished the jump settings without another word. There was a\ntension in the room that prevented them both from talking.\n\nIt was the next shipday before he saw her again, then it was completely\nby accident. She was in the astrogation dome when he entered, looking up\nat the sparkling immensity of the jump sky. For the first time he saw\nher off duty, wearing something other than a shipsuit. This was a loose,\nsoft robe that accentuated her beauty.\n\nShe smiled at him. \"The stars are so wonderful,\" she said. \"Come look.\"\nJason came close to her and with an unthinking, almost automatic\nmovement, put his arm around her. Neither did she resent it, for she\ncovered his hand with hers. Then they kissed and it was just the way he\nknew it would be.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nAfter that they were together constantly. When Meta was on duty he\nbrought her meals to the bridge and they talked. Jason learned little\nmore about her world since, by unspoken agreement, they didn't discuss\nit. He talked of the many planets he had visited and the people he had\nknown. She was an appreciative listener and the time went quickly by.\nThey enjoyed each other's company and it was a wonderful trip.\n\nThen it ended.\n\nThere were fourteen people aboard the ship, yet Jason had never seen\nmore than two or three at a time. There was a fixed rotation of duties\nthat they followed in the ship's operation. When not on duty the Pyrrans\nminded their own business in an intense and self-sufficient manner. Only\nwhen the ship came out of jump and the PA barked _assembly_ did they all\nget together.\n\nKerk was giving orders for the landing and questions were snapped back\nand forth. It was all technical and Jason didn't bother following it. It\nwas the attitude of the Pyrrans that drew his attention. Their talk\ntended to be faster now as were their motions. They were like soldiers\npreparing for battle.\n\nTheir sameness struck Jason for the first time. Not that they looked\nalike or did the same things. It was the _way_ they moved and reacted\nthat caused the striking similarity. They were like great, stalking\ncats. Walking fast, tense and ready to spring at all times, their eyes\nnever still for an instant.\n\nJason tried to talk to Meta after the meeting, but she was almost a\nstranger. She answered in monosyllables and her eyes never met his, just\nbrushed over them and went on. There was nothing he could really say so\nshe moved to leave. He started to put his hand out to stop her--then\nthought better of it. There would be other times to talk.\n\nKerk was the only one who took any notice of him--and then only to order\nhim to an acceleration couch.\n\nMeta's landings were infinitely worse than her take-offs. At least when\nshe landed on Pyrrus. There were sudden acceleration surges in every\ndirection. At one point there was a free fall that seemed endless. There\nwere loud thuds against the hull that shook the framework of the ship.\nIt was more like a battle than a landing, and Jason wondered how much\ntruth there was in that.\n\nWhen the ship finally landed Jason didn't even know it. The constant\n2 G's felt like deceleration. Only the descending moan of the ship's\nengines convinced him they were down. Unbuckling the straps and sitting\nup was an effort.\n\nTwo G's don't seem that bad--at first. Walking required the same\nexertion as would carrying a man of his own weight on his shoulders.\nWhen Jason lifted his arm to unlatch the door it was heavy as two arms.\nHe shuffled slowly towards the main lock.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey were all there ahead of him, two of the men rolling transparent\ncylinders from a nearby room. From their obvious weight and the way they\nclanged when they bumped, Jason knew they were made of transparent\nmetal. He couldn't conceive any possible use for them. Empty cylinders a\nmeter in diameter, longer than a man. One end solid, the other hinged\nand sealed. It wasn't until Kerk spun the sealing wheel and opened one\nof them that their use became apparent.\n\n\"Get in,\" Kerk said. \"When you're locked inside you'll be carried out of\nthe ship.\"\n\n\"Thank you, no,\" Jason told him. \"I have no particular desire to make a\nspectacular landing on your planet sealed up like a packaged sausage.\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool,\" was Kerk's snapped answer. \"We're _all_ going out in\nthese tubes. We've been away too long to risk the surface without\nreorientation.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJason did feel a little foolish as he saw the others getting into tubes.\nHe picked the nearest one, slid into it feet first, and pulled the lid\nclosed. When he tightened the wheel in the center, it squeezed down\nagainst a flexible seal. Within a minute the CO{2} content in the closed\ncylinder went up and an air regenerator at the bottom hummed into life.\n\nKerk was the last one in. He checked the seals on all the other tubes\nfirst, then jabbed the air-lock override release. As it started cycling\nhe quickly sealed himself in the remaining cylinder. Both inner and\nouter locks ground slowly open and dim light filtered in through sheets\nof falling rain.\n\nFor Jason, the whole thing seemed an anticlimax. All this preparation\nfor absolutely nothing. Long, impatient minutes passed before a lift\ntruck appeared driven by a Pyrran. He loaded the cylinders onto his\ntruck like so much dead cargo. Jason had the misfortune to be buried at\nthe bottom of the pile so he could see absolutely nothing when they\ndrove outside.\n\nIt wasn't until the man-carrying cylinders had been dumped in a\nmetal-walled room, that Jason saw his first native Pyrran life.\n\nThe lift truck driver was swinging a thick outer door shut when\nsomething flew in through the entrance and struck against the far wall.\nJason's eye was caught by the motion, he looked to see what it was when\nit dropped straight down towards his face.\n\nForgetful of the metal cylinder wall, he flinched away. The creature\nstruck the transparent metal and clung to it. Jason had the perfect\nopportunity to examine it in every detail.\n\nIt was almost too horrible to be believable. As though it were a bearer\nof death stripped to the very essentials. A mouth that split the head in\ntwo, rows of teeth, serrated and pointed. Leathery, claw-tipped wings,\nlonger claws on the limbs that tore at the metal wall.\n\nTerror rose up in Jason as he saw that the claws were tearing gouges in\nthe transparent metal. Wherever the creature's saliva touched the metal\nclouded and chipped under the assault of the teeth.\n\nLogic said these were just scratches on the thick tube. They couldn't\nmatter. But blind, unreasoning fear sent Jason curling away as far as he\ncould. Shrinking inside himself, seeking escape.\n\nOnly when the flying creature began dissolving did he realize the nature\nof the room outside. Sprays of steaming liquid came from all sides,\nraining down until the cylinders were covered. After one last clash of\nits jaws, the Pyrran animal was washed off and carried away. The liquid\ndrained away through the floor and a second and third shower followed.\n\nWhile the solutions were being pumped away, Jason fought to bring his\nemotions into line. He was surprised at himself. No matter how frightful\nthe creature had been, he couldn't understand the fear it could generate\nthrough the wall of the sealed tube. His reaction was all out of\nproportion to the cause. Even with the creature destroyed and washed out\nof sight it took all of his will power to steady his nerves and bring\nhis breathing back to normal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeta walked by outside and he realized the sterilization process was\nfinished. He opened his own tube and climbed wearily out. Meta and the\nothers had gone by this time and only a hawk-faced stranger remained,\nwaiting for him.\n\n\"I'm Brucco, in charge of the adaptation clinic. Kerk told me who you\nwere. I'm sorry you're here. Now come along, I want some blood samples.\"\n\n\"Now I feel right at home,\" Jason said. \"The old Pyrran hospitality.\"\nBrucco only grunted and stamped out. Jason followed him down a bare\ncorridor into a sterile lab.\n\nThe double gravity was tiring, a constant drag on sore muscles. While\nBrucco ran tests on the blood sample, Jason rested. He had almost dozed\noff into a painful sleep when Brucco returned with a tray of bottles and\nhypodermic needles.\n\n\"Amazing,\" he announced. \"Not an antibody in your serum that would be of\nany use on this planet. I have a batch of antigens here that will make\nyou sick as a beast for at least a day. Take off your shirt.\"\n\n\"Have you done this often?\" Jason asked. \"I mean juice up an outlander\nso he can enjoy the pleasures of your world?\"\n\nBrucco jammed in a needle that felt like it grated on the bone. \"Not\noften at all. Last time was years ago. A half-dozen researchers from\nsome institute, willing to pay well for the chance to study the local\nlife forms. We didn't say no. Always need more galaxy currency.\"\n\nJason was already beginning to feel light-headed from the shots. \"How\nmany of them lived?\" he mumbled vaguely.\n\n\"One. We got him off in time. Made them pay in advance of course.\"\n\nAt first Jason thought the Pyrran was joking. Then he remembered they\nhad very little interest in humor of any kind. If one-half of what Meta\nand Kerk had told him was true, six to one odds weren't bad at all.\n\nThere was a bed in the next room and Brucco helped him to it. Jason felt\ndrugged and probably was. He fell into a deep sleep and into the dream.\n\nFear and hatred mixed in equal parts and washed over him red hot. If\nthis was a dream, he never wanted to sleep again. If it wasn't a dream,\nhe wanted to die. He tried to fight up against it, but only sank in more\ndeeply. There was no beginning and no end to the fear and no way to\nescape.\n\nWhen consciousness returned Jason could remember no detail of the\nnightmare. Just the fear remained. He was soaked with sweat and ached in\nevery muscle. It must have been the massive dose of shots, he finally\ndecided, that and the brutal gravity. That didn't take the taste of fear\nout of his mouth, though.\n\nBrucco stuck his head in the door then and looked Jason up and down.\n\"Thought you were dead,\" he said. \"Slept the clock around. Don't move,\nI'll get something to pick you up.\"\n\nThe pickup was in the form of another needle and a glassful of\nevil-looking fluid. It settled his thirst, but made him painfully aware\nof gnawing hunger.\n\n\"Want to eat?\" Brucco asked. \"I'll bet you do. I've speeded up your\nmetabolism so you'll build muscle faster. Only way you'll ever beat the\ngravity. Give you quite an appetite for a while though.\"\n\nBrucco ate at the same time and Jason had a chance to ask some\nquestions. \"When do I get a chance to look around your fascinating\nplanet? So far this trip has been about as interesting as a jail term.\"\n\n\"Relax and enjoy your food. Probably be months before you're able to go\noutside. If at all.\"\n\nJason felt his jaw hanging and closed it with a snap. \"Could you\npossibly tell me why?\"\n\n\"Of course. You will have to go through the same training course that\nour children take. It takes them six years. Of course it's their first\nsix years of life. So you might think that you, as an adult, could learn\nfaster. Then again they have the advantage of heredity. All I can say is\nyou'll go outside these sealed buildings when you're ready.\"\n\nBrucco had finished eating while he talked, and sat staring at Jason's\nbare arms with growing disgust. \"The first thing we want to get you is a\ngun,\" he said. \"It gives me a sick feeling to see someone without one.\"\n\nOf course Brucco wore his own gun continually, even within the sealed\nbuildings.\n\n\"Every gun is fitted to its owner and would be useless on anyone else,\"\nBrucco said. \"I'll show you why.\" He led Jason to an armory jammed with\ndeadly weapons. \"Put your arm in this while I make the adjustments.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a boxlike machine with a pistol grip on the side. Jason clutched\nthe grip and rested his elbow on a metal loop. Brucco fixed pointers\nthat touched his arm, then copied the results from the meters. Reading\nthe figures from his list he selected various components from bins and\nquickly assembled a power holster and gun. With the holster strapped to\nhis forearm and the gun in his hand, Jason noticed for the first time\nthey were connected by a flexible cable. The gun fitted his hand\nperfectly.\n\n\"This is the secret of the power holster,\" Brucco said, tapping the\nflexible cable. \"It is perfectly loose while you are using the weapon.\nBut when you want it returned to the holster--\" Brucco made an\nadjustment and the cable became a stiff rod that whipped the gun from\nJason's hand and suspended it in midair.\n\n\"Then the return.\" The rod-cable whirred and snapped the gun back into\nthe holster. \"The drawing action is the opposite of this, of course.\"\n\n\"A great gadget,\" Jason said, \"but how _do_ I draw? Do I whistle or\nsomething for the gun to pop out?\"\n\n\"No, it is not sonic control,\" Brucco answered with a sober face. \"It is\nmuch more precise than that. Here, take your left hand and grasp an\nimaginary gun butt. Tense your trigger finger. Do you notice the pattern\nof the tendons in the wrist? Sensitive actuators touch the tendons in\nyour right wrist. They ignore all patterns except the one that says\n_hand ready to receive gun_. After a time the mechanism becomes\ncompletely automatic. When you want the gun--it is in your hand. When\nyou don't--it is in the holster.\"\n\nJason made grasping motions with his right hand, crooked his index\nfinger. There was a sudden, smashing pain against his hand and a loud\nroar. The gun was in his hand--half the fingers were numb--and smoke\ncurled up from the barrel.\n\n\"Of course there are only blank charges in the gun until you learn\ncontrol. Guns are _always_ loaded. There is no safety. Notice the lack\nof a trigger guard. That enables you to bend your trigger finger a\nslight bit more when drawing so the gun will fire the instant it touches\nyour hand.\"\n\nIt was without a doubt the most murderous weapon Jason had ever\nhandled, as well as being the hardest to manage. Working against the\nmuscle-burning ache of high gravity, he fought to control the devilish\ndevice. It had an infuriating way of vanishing into the holster just as\nhe was about to pull the trigger. Even worse was the tendency to leap\nout before he was quite ready. The gun went to the position where his\nhand should be. If the fingers weren't correctly placed, they were\ncrashed aside. Jason only stopped the practice when his entire hand was\none livid bruise.\n\nComplete mastery would come with time, but he could already understand\nwhy the Pyrrans never removed their guns. It would be like removing a\npart of your own body. The movement of gun from holster to hand was too\nfast for him to detect. It was certainly faster than the neural current\nthat shaped the hand into the gun-holding position. For all apparent\npurposes it was like having a lightning bolt in your fingertip. Point\nthe finger and _blamm_, there's the explosion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBrucco had left Jason to practice alone. When his aching hand could take\nno more, he stopped and headed back towards his own quarters. Turning a\ncorner he had a quick glimpse of a familiar figure going away from him.\n\n\"Meta! Wait for a second--I want to talk to you.\"\n\nShe turned impatiently as he shuffled up, going as fast as he could in\nthe doubled gravity. Everything about her seemed different from the girl\nhe had known on the ship. Heavy boots came as high as her knees, her\nfigure was lost in bulky coveralls of some metallic fabric. The trim\nwaist was bulged out by a belt of canisters. Her very expression was\ncoldly distant.\n\n\"I've missed you,\" he said. \"I hadn't realized you were in this\nbuilding.\" He reached for her hand but she moved it out of his reach.\n\n\"What is it you want?\" she asked.\n\n\"What is it I want!\" he echoed with barely concealed anger. \"This is\nJason, remember me? We're friends. It _is_ allowed for friends to talk\nwithout 'wanting' anything.\"\n\n\"What happened on the ship has nothing to do with what happens on\nPyrrus.\" She started forward impatiently as she talked. \"I have finished\nmy reconditioning and must return to work. You'll be staying here in the\nsealed buildings so I won't be seeing you.\"\n\n\"Why don't you say 'with the rest of the children'--that's what your\ntone implies? And don't try walking out, there are some things we have\nto settle first--\"\n\nJason made the mistake of putting out his hand to stop her. He didn't\nreally know what happened next. One instant he was standing--the next he\nsprawled suddenly on the floor. His shoulder was badly bruised, and Meta\nhad vanished down the corridor.\n\nLimping back to his own room he cursed women in general and Meta in\nparticular. Dropping onto his rock-hard bed he tried to remember the\nreasons that had brought him here in the first place. And weighed them\nagainst the perpetual torture of the gravity, the fear-filled dreams it\ninspired, the automatic contempt of these people for any outsider. He\nquickly checked the growing tendency to feel sorry for himself. By\nPyrran standards he _was_ soft and helpless. If he wanted them to think\nany better of him, he would have to change a good deal.\n\nHe sank into a fatigue-drugged sleep then, that was broken only by the\nscreaming fear of his dreams.\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nIn the morning Jason awoke with a bad headache and the feeling he had\nnever been to sleep. As he took some of the carefully portioned\nstimulants that Brucco had given him, he wondered again about the\ncombination of factors that filled his sleep with such horror.\n\n\"Eat quickly,\" Brucco told him when they met in the dining room. \"I can\nno longer spare you time for individual instruction. You will join the\nregular classes and take the prescribed courses. Only come to me if\nthere is some special problem that the instructors or trainers can't\nhandle.\"\n\nThe classes--as Jason should have expected--were composed of stern-faced\nlittle children. With their compact bodies and no-nonsense mannerisms\nthey were recognizably Pyrran. But they were still children enough to\nconsider it very funny to have an adult in their classes. Jammed behind\none of the tiny desks, the red-faced Jason did not think it was much of\na joke.\n\nAll resemblance to a normal school ended with the physical form of the\nclassroom. For one thing, every child--no matter how small--packed a\ngun. And the courses were all involved with survival. The only possible\ngrade in a curriculum like this was one hundred per cent and students\nstayed with a lesson until they mastered it perfectly. No courses were\noffered in the normal scholastic subjects. Presumably these were studied\nafter the child graduated survival school and could face the world\nalone. Which was a logical and cold-hearted way of looking at things. In\nfact, logical and cold-hearted could describe any Pyrran activity.\n\nMost of the morning was spent on the operation of one of the medikits\nthat strapped around the waist. This was a poison analyzer that was\npressed over a puncture wound. If any toxins were present, the antidote\nwas automatically injected on the site. Simple in operation but\nincredibly complex in construction. Since all Pyrrans serviced their own\nequipment--you could then only blame yourself if it failed--they had to\nlearn the construction and repair of all the devices. Jason did much\nbetter than the child students, though the effort exhausted him.\n\nIn the afternoon he had his first experience with a training machine.\nHis instructor was a twelve-year-old boy, whose cold voice didn't\nconceal his contempt for the soft off-worlder.\n\n\"All the training machines are physical duplicates of the real surface\nof the planet, corrected constantly as the life forms change. The only\ndifference between them is the varying degree of deadliness. This first\nmachine you will use is of course the one infants are put into--\"\n\n\"You're too kind,\" Jason murmured. \"Your flattery overwhelms me.\" The\ninstructor continued, taking no notice of the interruption.\n\n\"... Infants are put into as soon as they can crawl. It is real in\nsubstance, though completely deactivated.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTraining machine was the wrong word, Jason realized as they entered\nthrough the thick door. This was a chunk of the outside world duplicated\nin an immense chamber. It took very little suspension of reality for him\nto forget the painted ceiling and artificial sun high above and imagine\nhimself outdoors at last. The scene _seemed_ peaceful enough. Though\nclouds banking on the horizon threatened a violent Pyrran storm.\n\n\"You must wander around and examine things,\" the instructor told Jason.\n\"Whenever you touch something with your hand, you will be told about it.\nLike this--\"\n\nThe boy bent over and pushed his finger against a blade of the soft\ngrass that covered the ground. Immediately a voice barked from hidden\nspeakers.\n\n\"Poison grass. Boots to be worn at all times.\"\n\nJason kneeled and examined the grass. The blade was tipped with a hard,\nshiny hook. He realized with a start that every single blade of grass\nwas the same. The soft green lawn was a carpet of death. As he\nstraightened up he glimpsed something under a broad-leafed plant. A\ncrouching, scale-covered animal, whose tapered head terminated in a long\nspike.\n\n\"What's _that_ in the bottom of my garden?\" he asked. \"You certainly\ngive the babies pleasant playmates.\" Jason turned and realized he was\ntalking to the air, the instructor was gone. He shrugged and petted the\nscaly monstrosity.\n\n\"Horndevil,\" the impersonal voice said from midair. \"Clothing and shoes\nno protection. Kill it.\"\n\nA sharp _crack_ shattered the silence as Jason's gun went off. The\nhorndevil fell on its side, keyed to react to the blank charge.\n\n\"Well ... I _am_ learning,\" Jason said, and the thought pleased him. The\nwords _kill it_ had been used by Brucco while teaching him to use the\ngun. Their stimulus had reached an unconscious level. He was aware of\nwanting to shoot only after he had heard the shot. His respect for\nPyrran training techniques went up.\n\nJason spent a thoroughly unpleasant afternoon wandering in the child's\ngarden of horror. Death was everywhere. While all the time the\ndisembodied voice gave him stern advice in simple language. So he could\ndo unto, rather than being done in. He had never realized that violent\ndeath could come in so many repulsive forms. _Everything_ here was\ndeadly to man--from the smallest insect to the largest plant.\n\nSuch singleness of purpose seemed completely unnatural. Why was this\nplanet so alien to human life? He made a mental note to ask Brucco.\nMeanwhile he tried to find one life form that wasn't out for his blood.\nHe didn't succeed. After a long search he found the only thing that when\ntouched didn't elicit deadly advice. This was a chunk of rock that\nprojected from a meadow of poison grass. Jason sat on it with a friendly\nfeeling and pulled his feet up. An oasis of peace. Some minutes passed\nwhile he rested his gravity-weary body.\n\n\"ROTFUNGUS--DO NOT TOUCH!\"\n\nThe voice blasted at twice its normal volume and Jason leaped as if he\nhad been shot. The gun was in his hand, nosing about for a target. Only\nwhen he bent over and looked closely at the rock where he had been\nsitting, did he understand. There were flaky gray patches that hadn't\nbeen there when he sat down.\n\n\"Oh you tricky devils!\" he shouted at the machine. \"How many kids have\nyou frightened off that rock after they thought they had found a little\npeace!\" He resented the snide bit of conditioning, but respected it at\nthe same time. Pyrrans learned very early in life that there was no\nsafety on this planet--except that which they provided for themselves.\n\nWhile he was learning about Pyrrus he was gaining new insight into the\nPyrrans as well.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\nDays turned into weeks in the school, cut off from the world outside.\nJason almost became proud of his ability to deal death. He recognized\nall the animals and plants in the nursery room and had been promoted to\na trainer where the beasts made sluggish charges at him. His gun picked\noff the attackers with dull regularity. The constant, daily classes were\nbeginning to bore him as well.\n\nThough the gravity still dragged at him, his muscles were making great\nefforts to adjust. After the daily classes he no longer collapsed\nimmediately into bed. Only the nightmares got worse. He had finally\nmentioned them to Brucco, who mixed up a sleeping potion that took away\nmost of their effect. The dreams were still there, but Jason was only\nvaguely aware of them upon awakening.\n\nBy the time Jason had mastered all the gadgetry that kept the Pyrrans\nalive, he had graduated to a most realistic trainer that was only a\nhair-breadth away from the real thing. The difference was just in\nquality. The insect poisons caused swelling and pain instead of instant\ndeath. Animals could cause bruises and tear flesh, but stopped short of\nripping off limbs. You couldn't get killed in this trainer, but could\ncertainly come very close to it.\n\nJason wandered through this large and rambling jungle with the rest of\nthe five-year-olds. There was something a bit humorous, yet sad, about\ntheir unchildlike grimness. Though they still might laugh in their\nquarters, they realized there was no laughing outside. To them survival\nwas linked up with social acceptance and desirability. In this way\nPyrrus was a simple black-and-white society. To prove your value to\nyourself and your world, you only had to stay alive. This had great\nimportance in racial survival, but had very stultifying effects on\nindividual personality. Children were turned into like-faced killers,\nalways on the alert to deal out death.\n\nSome of the children graduated into the outside world and others took\ntheir places. Jason watched this process for a while before he realized\nthat all of those from the original group he had entered with were gone.\nThat same day he looked up the chief of the adaptation center.\n\n\"Brucco,\" Jason asked, \"how long do you plan to keep me in this\nkindergarten shooting gallery?\"\n\n\"You're not being 'kept' here,\" Brucco told him in his usual irritated\ntone. \"You will be here until you qualify for the outside.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Which I have a funny feeling will be never. I can now field strip and\nreassemble every one of your blasted gadgets in the dark. I am a dead\nshot with this cannon. At this present moment, if I had to, I could\nwrite a book on the Complete Flora and Fauna of Pyrrus, and How to Kill\nIt. Perhaps I don't do as well as my six-year-old companions, but I have\na hunch I do about as good a job now as I ever will. Is that true?\"\n\nBrucco squirmed with the effort to be evasive, yet didn't succeed. \"I\nthink, that is, you know you weren't born here, and--\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" Jason said with glee, \"a straight-faced old Pyrran like\nyou shouldn't try to lie to one of the weaker races that specialize in\nthat sort of thing. It goes without saying that I'll always be sluggish\nwith this gravity, as well as having other inborn handicaps. I admit\nthat. We're not talking about that now. The question is--will I improve\nwith more training, or have I reached a peak of my own _development_\nnow?\"\n\nBrucco sweated. \"With the passage of time there will be improvement of\ncourse--\"\n\n\"Sly devil!\" Jason waggled a finger at him. \"Yes or no, now. Will I\nimprove _now_ by more training _now_?\"\n\n\"No,\" Brucco said, and still looked troubled. Jason sized him up like a\npoker hand.\n\n\"Now let's think about that. I won't improve--yet I'm still stuck here.\nThat's no accident. So you must have been ordered to keep me here. And\nfrom what I have seen of this planet, admittedly very little, I would\nsay that Kerk ordered you to keep me here. Is that right?\"\n\n\"He was only doing it for your own sake,\" Brucco explained, \"trying to\nkeep you alive.\"\n\n\"The truth is out,\" Jason said, \"so let us now forget about it. I didn't\ncome here to shoot robots with your offspring. So please show me the\nstreet door. Or is there a graduating ceremony first? Speeches, handing\nout school pins, sabers overhead--\"\n\n\"Nothing like that,\" Brucco snapped. \"I don't see how a grown man like\nyou can talk such nonsense all the time. There is none of that, of\ncourse. Only some final work in the partial survival chamber. That is a\ncompound that connects with the outside--really is a part of the\noutside--except the most violent life forms are excluded. And even some\nof those manage to find their way in once in a while.\"\n\n\"When do I go?\" Jason shot the question.\n\n\"Tomorrow morning. Get a good night's sleep first. You'll need it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was one bit of ceremony attendant with the graduation. When Jason\ncame into his office in the morning, Brucco slid a heavy gun clip across\nthe table.\n\n\"These are live bullets,\" he said. \"I'm sure you'll be needing them.\nAfter this your gun will always be loaded.\"\n\nThey came up to a heavy air lock, the only locked door Jason had seen in\nthe center. While Brucco unlocked it and threw the bolts, a sober-faced\neight-year-old with a bandaged leg limped up.\n\n\"This is Grif,\" Brucco said. \"He will stay with you, wherever you go,\nfrom now on.\"\n\n\"My personal bodyguard?\" Jason asked, looking down at the stocky child\nwho barely reached his waist.\n\n\"You might call him that.\" Brucco swung the door open. \"Grif tangled\nwith a sawbird, so he won't be able to do any real work for a while. You\nyourself admitted that you will never be able to equal a Pyrran, so you\nshould be glad of a little protection.\"\n\n\"Always a kind word, that's you, Brucco,\" Jason said. He bent over and\nshook hands with the boy. Even the eight-year-olds had a bone-crushing\ngrip.\n\nThe two of them entered the lock and Brucco swung the inner door shut\nbehind them. As soon as it was sealed the outer door opened\nautomatically. It was only partly open when Grif's gun blasted twice.\nThen they stepped out onto the surface of Pyrrus, over the smoking body\nof one of its animals.\n\nVery symbolic, Jason thought. He was also bothered by the realization\nthat he hadn't remembered to look for something coming in. Then, too, he\ncouldn't even identify the beast from its charred remains. He glanced\naround, hoping he would be able to fire first himself, next time.\n\nThis was an unfulfilled hope. The few beasts that came their way were\nalways seen first by the boy. After an hour of this, Jason was so\nirritated that he blasted an evil-looking thorn plant out of existence.\nHe hoped that Grif wouldn't look too closely at it. Of course the boy\ndid.\n\n\"That plant wasn't close. It is stupid to waste good ammunition on a\nplant,\" Grif said.\n\nThere was no real trouble during the day. Jason ended by being bored,\nthough soaked by the frequent rainstorms. If Grif was capable of\ncarrying on a conversation, he didn't show it. All Jason's gambits\nfailed. The following day went the same way. On the third day, Brucco\nappeared and looked Jason carefully up and down.\n\n\"I don't like to say it, but I suppose you are as ready to leave now as\nyou ever will be. Change the virus filter noseplugs every day. Always\ncheck boots for tears and metalcloth suiting for rips. Medikit supplies\nrenewed once a week.\"\n\n\"And wipe my nose and wear my galoshes. Anything else?\" Jason asked.\n\nBrucco started to say something, then changed his mind. \"Nothing that\nyou shouldn't know well by now. Keep alert. And ... good luck.\" He\nfollowed up the words with a crushing handshake that was totally\nunexpected. As soon as the numbness left Jason's hand, he and Grif went\nout through the large entrance lock.\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nReal as they had been, the training chambers had not prepared him for\nthe surface of Pyrrus. There was the basic similarity of course. The\nfeel of the poison grass underfoot and the erratic flight of a stingwing\nin the last instant before Grif blasted it. But these were scarcely\nnoticeable in the crash of the elements around him.\n\nA heavy rain was falling, more like a sheet of water than individual\ndrops. Gusts of wind tore at it, hurling the deluge into his face. He\nwiped his eyes clear and could barely make out the conical forms of two\nvolcanoes on the horizon, vomiting out clouds of smoke and flame. The\nreflection of this inferno was a sullen redness on the clouds that raced\nby in banks above them.\n\nThere was a rattle on his hard hat and something bounced off to splash\nto the ground. He bent over and picked up a hailstone as thick as his\nthumb. A sudden flurry of hail hammered painfully at his back and neck,\nhe straightened hurriedly.\n\nAs quickly as it started the storm was over. The sun burned down,\nmelting the hailstones and sending curls of steam up from the wet\nstreet. Jason sweated inside his armored clothing. Yet before they had\ngone a block it was raining again and he shook with chill.\n\nGrif trudged steadily along, indifferent to the weather or the volcanoes\nthat rumbled on the horizon and shook the ground beneath their feet.\nJason tried to ignore his discomfort and match the boy's pace.\n\nThe walk was a depressing one. The heavy, squat buildings loomed grayly\nthrough the rain, more than half of them in ruins. They walked on a\npedestrian way in the middle of the street. The occasional armored\ntrucks went by on both sides of them. The midstreet sidewalk puzzled\nJason until Grif blasted something that hurtled out of a ruined building\ntowards them. The central location gave them some chance to see what was\ncoming. Suddenly Jason was very tired.\n\n\"Grif, this city of yours is sure down at the heels. I hope the other\nones are in better shape.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean talking about heels. But there are no other\ncities. Some mining camps that can't be located inside the perimeter.\nBut no other cities.\"\n\nThis surprised Jason. He had always visualized the planet with more than\none city. There were a _lot_ of things he didn't know about Pyrrus, he\nrealized suddenly. All of his efforts since landing had been taken up\nwith the survival studies. There were a number of questions he wanted to\nask. But ask them of somebody other than his grouchy eight-year-old\nbodyguard. There was one person who would be best equipped to tell him\nwhat he wanted to know.\n\n\"Do you know Kerk?\" he asked the boy. \"Apparently he's your ambassador\nto a lot of places, but his last name--\"\n\n\"Sure, everybody knows Kerk. But he's busy, you shouldn't see him.\"\n\nJason shook a finger at him. \"Minder of my body you may be. But minder\nof my soul you are not. What do you say I call the shots and you go\nalong to shoot the monsters? O.K.?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey took shelter from a sudden storm of fist-sized hailstones. Then,\nwith ill grace, Grif led the way to one of the larger, central\nbuildings. There were more people here and some of them even glanced at\nJason for a minute, before turning back to their business. Jason dragged\nhimself up two flights of stairs before they reached a door marked\nCO-ORDINATION AND SUPPLY.\n\n\"Kerk in here?\" Jason asked.\n\n\"Sure,\" the boy told him. \"He's in charge.\"\n\n\"Fine. Now you get a nice cold drink, or your lunch, or something, and\nmeet me back here in a couple of hours. I imagine Kerk can do as good a\njob of looking after me as you can.\"\n\nThe boy stood doubtfully for a few seconds, then turned away. Jason\nwiped off some more sweat and pushed through the door.\n\nThere were a handful of people in the office beyond. None of them looked\nup at Jason or asked his business. Everything has a purpose on Pyrrus.\nIf he came there--he must have had a good reason. No one would ever\nthink to ask him what he wanted. Jason, used to the petty officialdom of\na thousand worlds, waited for a few moments before he understood. There\nwas only one other door. He shuffled over and opened it.\n\nKerk looked up from a desk strewed about with papers and ledgers. \"I was\nwondering when you would show up,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot sooner if you hadn't prevented it,\" Jason told him as he dropped\nwearily into a chair. \"It finally dawned on me that I could spend the\nrest of my life in your blood-thirsty nursery school if I didn't do\nsomething about it. So here I am.\"\n\n\"Ready to return to the 'civilized' worlds, now that you've seen enough\nof Pyrrus?\"\n\n\"I am not,\" Jason said. \"And I'm getting very tired of everyone telling\nme to leave. I'm beginning to think that you and the rest of the Pyrrans\nare trying to hide something.\"\n\nKerk smiled at the thought. \"What could we have to hide? I doubt if any\nplanet has as simple and one-directional an existence as ours.\"\n\n\"If that's true, then you certainly wouldn't mind answering a few direct\nquestions about Pyrrus?\"\n\nKerk started to protest, then laughed. \"Well done. I should know better\nby now than to argue with you. What do you want to know?\"\n\nJason tried to find a comfortable position on the hard chair, then gave\nup. \"What's the population of your planet?\" he asked.\n\nFor a second Kerk hesitated, then said, \"Roughly thirty thousand. That\nis not very much for a planet that has been settled this long, but the\nreason for that is obvious.\"\n\n\"All right, population thirty thousand,\" Jason said. \"Now how about\nsurface control of your planet. I was surprised to find out that this\ncity within its protective wall--the perimeter--is the only one on the\nplanet. Let's not consider the mining camps, since they are obviously\njust extensions of the city. Would you say then, that you people control\nmore or less of the planet's surface than you did in the past?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKerk picked up a length of steel pipe from the desk, that he used as a\npaperweight, and toyed with it as he thought. The thick steel bent like\nrubber at his touch, as he concentrated on his answer.\n\n\"That's hard to say offhand. There must be records of that sort of\nthing, though I wouldn't know where to find them. It depends on so many\nfactors--\"\n\n\"Let's forget that for now then,\" Jason said. \"I have another question\nthat's really more relevant. Wouldn't you say that the population of\nPyrrus is declining steadily, year after year?\"\n\nThere was a sharp _twang_ as the steel snapped in Kerk's fingers, the\npieces dropping to the floor. He stood, over Jason, his hands extended\ntowards the smaller man, his face flushed and angry.\n\n\"Don't ever say that,\" he roared. \"Don't let me ever hear you say that\nagain!\"\n\nJason sat as quietly as he could, talking slowly and picking out each\nword with care. His life hung in the balance.\n\n\"Don't get angry, Kerk. I meant no harm. I'm on your side, remember? I\ncan talk to you because you've seen much more of the universe than the\nPyrrans who have never left the planet. You are used to discussing\nthings. You know that words are just symbols. We can talk and know you\ndon't have to lose your temper over mere words--\"\n\nKerk slowly lowered his arms and stepped away. Then he turned and poured\nhimself a glass of water from a bottle on the desk. He kept his back\nturned to Jason while he drank.\n\nVery little of the sweat that Jason wiped from his sopping face was\ncaused by the heat in the room.\n\n\"I'm ... sorry I lost my temper,\" Kerk said, dropping heavily into his\nchair. \"Doesn't usually happen. Been working hard lately, must have got\nmy temper on edge.\" He made no mention of what Jason had said.\n\n\"Happens to all of us,\" Jason told him. \"I won't begin to describe the\ncondition my nerves were in when I hit this planet. I'm finally forced\nto admit that everything you said about Pyrrus is true. It is the most\ndeadly spot in the system. And only native-born Pyrrans could possibly\nsurvive here. I can manage to fumble along a bit after my training, but\nI know I would never stand a chance on my own. You probably know I have\nan eight-year-old as a bodyguard. Gives a good idea of my real status\nhere.\"\n\nAnger suppressed, Kerk was back in control of himself now. His eyes\nnarrowed in thought. \"Surprises me to hear you say that. Never thought I\nwould hear you admit that anyone could be better than you at anything.\nIsn't that why you came here? To prove that you were as good as any\nnative-born Pyrran?\"\n\n\"Score one for your side,\" Jason admitted. \"I didn't think it showed\nthat much. And I'm glad to see your mind isn't as muscle-bound as your\nbody. Yes, I'll admit that was probably my main reason for coming, that\nand curiosity.\"\n\nKerk was following his own train of thoughts, and puzzled where they\nwere leading him. \"You came here to prove that you were as good as any\nnative-born Pyrran. Yet now you admit that any eight-year-old can\noutdraw you. That just doesn't stack up with what I know about you. If\nyou give with one hand, you must be taking back with the other. In what\nway do you still feel your natural superiority?\"\n\nJason thought a long time before answering.\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" he finally said. \"But don't snap my neck for it. I'm\ngambling that your civilized mind can control your reflexes. Because I\nhave to talk about things that are strictly taboo on Pyrrus.\n\n\"In your people's eyes I'm a weakling because I come from off-world.\nRealize though, that this is also my strength. I can see things that are\nhidden from you by long association. You know, the old business of not\nbeing able to see the forest for the trees in the way.\" Kerk nodded\nagreement and Jason went on.\n\n\"To continue the analogy further, I landed from an airship, and at\nfirst all I _could_ see was the forest. To me certain facts are\nobvious. I think that you people know them too, only you keep your\nthoughts carefully repressed. They are hidden thoughts that are\ncompletely taboo. I am going to say one of them out loud now and hope\nyou can control yourself well enough to not kill me.\"\n\nKerk's great hands tightened on the arms of his chair, the only sign\nthat he had heard. Jason talked quietly, as smoothly and easily as a\nlancet probing into a brain.\n\n\"Human beings are losing the war on Pyrrus. There is no chance they can\nwin. They could leave for another planet, but that wouldn't be victory.\nYet, if they stay and continue this war, they only prolong a\nparticularly bloody form of racial suicide. With each generation the\npopulation drops. Until eventually the planet will win.\"\n\nOne arm of Kerk's plastic and steel chair tore loose under the crushing\ngrasp of his fingers. He didn't notice it. The rest of his body was\nrock-still and his eyes fixed on Jason.\n\nLooking away from the fractured chair, Jason sought for the right words.\n\n\"This is not a real war, but a disastrous treating of symptoms. Like\ncutting off cancerous fingers one by one. The only result can be\nultimate death. None of you seem to realize that. All you see are the\ntrees. It has never occurred to you that you could treat the _causes_ of\nthis war and end it forever.\"\n\nKerk dropped the arm of the chair clattering to the floor. He sat up,\nastonished. \"What the devil do you mean? You sound like a grubber.\"\n\nJason didn't ask what a grubber was--but he filed the name.\n\n\"Call me a Pyrran by adoption. I want this planet to survive as much as\nyou do. I think this war can be ended by finding the _causes_--and\nchanging them, whatever they are.\"\n\n\"You're talking nonsense,\" Kerk said. \"This is just an alien world that\nmust be battled. The causes are self-obvious facts of existence.\"\n\n\"No, they're not,\" Jason insisted. \"Consider for a second. When you are\naway for any length of time from this planet, you must take a refresher\ncourse. To see how things have changed for the worse while you were\ngone. Well, that's a linear progression. If things get worse when you\nextend into the future, then they have to get better if you extend into\nthe past. It is also good theory--though I don't know if the facts will\nbear me out--to say that if you extend it far enough into the past you\nwill reach a time when mankind and Pyrrus were not at war with each\nother.\"\n\nKerk was beyond speech now, only capable of sitting and listening while\nJason drove home the blows of inescapable logic.\n\n\"There is evidence to support this theory. Even you will admit that I,\nif I am no match for Pyrran life, am surely well versed in it. And all\nPyrran flora and fauna I've seen have one thing in common. They're not\nfunctional. _None_ of their immense armory of weapons is used against\neach other. Their toxins don't seem to operate against Pyrran life. They\nare good only for dispensing death to Homo sapiens. And _that_ is a\nphysical impossibility. In the three hundred years that men have been on\nthis planet, the life forms couldn't have naturally adapted in this\nmanner.\"\n\n\"But they _have_ done it!\" Kerk bellowed.\n\n\"You are so right,\" Jason told him calmly. \"And if they have done it\nthere must be some agency at work. Operating how--I have no idea. But\nsomething has caused the life on Pyrrus to declare war, and I'd like to\nfind out what that something is. What was the dominant life form here\nwhen your ancestors landed?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I'm sure I wouldn't know,\" Kerk said. \"You're not suggesting, are you,\nthat there are sentient beings on Pyrrus other than those of human\ndescent? Creatures who are organizing the planet to battle us?\"\n\n\"I'm not suggesting it--you are. That means you're getting the idea. I\nhave no idea what caused this change, but I would sure like to find out.\nThen see if it can be changed back. Nothing promised, of course. You'll\nagree, though, that it is worth investigating.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFist smacking into his palm, his heavy footsteps shaking the building,\nKerk paced back and forth the length of the room. He was at war with\nhimself. New ideas fought old beliefs. It was so sudden--and so hard not\nto believe.\n\nWithout asking permission Jason helped himself to some chilled water\nfrom the bottle, and sank back into the chair, exhausted. Something\nwhizzed in through the open window, tearing a hole in the protective\nscreen. Kerk blasted it without changing stride, without even knowing he\nhad done it.\n\nThe decision didn't take long. Geared to swift activity, the big Pyrran\nfound it impossible not to decide quickly. The pacing stopped and a\nfinger stabbed at Jason.\n\n\"I don't say you have convinced me, but I find it impossible to find a\nready answer to your arguments. So until I do, we will have to operate\nas if they are true. Now what do you plan to do, what _can_ you do?\"\n\nJason ticked the points off on his fingers. \"One, I'll need a place to\nlive and work that is well protected. So instead of spending my energies\non just remaining alive I can devote some study to this project. Two, I\nwant someone to help me--and act as a bodyguard at the same time. And\nsomeone, please, with a little more scope of interest than my present\nwatchdog. I would suggest Meta for the job.\"\n\n\"Meta?\" Kerk was surprised. \"She is a space pilot and defense-screen\noperator, what good could she possibly be on a project like this?\"\n\n\"The most good possible. She has had experience on other worlds and can\nshift her point of view--at least a bit. And she must know as much about\nthis planet as any other educated adult and can answer any questions I\nask.\" Jason smiled. \"In addition to which she is an attractive girl,\nwhose company I enjoy.\"\n\nKerk grunted. \"I was wondering if you would get around to mentioning\nthat last reason. The others make sense though, so I'm not going to\nargue. I'll round up a replacement for her and have Meta sent here.\nThere are plenty of sealed buildings you can use.\"\n\nAfter talking to one of the assistants from the outer office, Kerk made\nsome calls on the screen. The correct orders were quickly issued. Jason\nwatched it all with interest.\n\n\"Pardon me for asking,\" he finally said. \"But are you the dictator of\nthis planet? You just snap your fingers and they all jump.\"\n\n\"I suppose it looks that way,\" Kerk admitted. \"But that is just an\nillusion. No one is in complete charge on Pyrrus, neither is there\nanything resembling a democratic system. After all, our total population\nis about the size of an army division. Everyone does the job they are\nbest qualified for. Various activities are separated into departments\nwith the most qualified person in charge. I run Co-ordination and\nSupply, which is about the loosest category. We fill in the gaps between\ndepartments and handle procuring from off-planet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeta came in then and talked to Kerk. She completely ignored Jason's\npresence. \"I was relieved and sent here,\" she said. \"What is it? Change\nin flight schedule?\"\n\n\"You might call it that,\" Kerk said. \"As of now you are dismissed from\nall your old assignments and assigned to a new department: Investigation\nand Research. That tired-looking fellow there is your department head.\"\n\n\"A sense of humor,\" Jason said. \"The only native-born one on Pyrrus.\nCongratulations, there's hope for the planet yet.\"\n\nMeta glanced back and forth between them. \"I don't understand. I can't\nbelieve it. I mean a new department--why?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Kerk said. \"I didn't mean to be cruel. I thought perhaps\nyou might feel more at ease. What I said was true. Jason has a way--or\nmay have a way--to be of immense value to Pyrrus. Will you help him?\"\n\nMeta had her composure back. And a little anger. \"Do I have to? Is that\nan order? You know I have work to do. I'm sure you will realize it is\nmore important than something a person from _off-planet_ might imagine.\nHe can't really understand--\"\n\n\"Yes. It's an order.\" The snap was back in Kerk's voice. Meta flushed at\nthe tone.\n\n\"Perhaps I can explain,\" Jason broke in. \"After all the whole thing is\nmy idea. But first I would like your co-operation. Will you take the\nclip out of your gun and give it to Kerk?\"\n\nMeta looked frightened, but Kerk nodded in solemn agreement. \"Just for a\nfew minutes, Meta. I have my gun so you will be safe here. I think I\nknow what Jason has in mind, and from personal experience I'm afraid he\nis right.\"\n\nReluctantly Meta passed over the clip and cleared the charge in the\ngun's chamber. Only then did Jason explain.\n\n\"I have a theory about life on Pyrrus, and I'm afraid I'll have to\nshatter some illusions when I explain. To begin with, the fact must be\nadmitted that your people are slowly losing the war here and will\neventually be destroyed--\"\n\nBefore he was half through the sentence, Meta's gun was directed between\nhis eyes and she was wildly snapping the trigger. There was only hatred\nand revulsion in her expression. Kerk took her by the shoulders and sat\nher in his chair, before anything worse happened. It took a while before\nshe could calm down enough to listen to Jason's words. It is not easy to\nhave the carefully built-up falsehoods of a lifetime shattered. Only the\nfact that she had seen something of other worlds enabled her to listen\nat all.\n\nThe light of unreason was still in her eyes when he had finished,\ntelling her the things he and Kerk had discussed. She sat tensely,\npushed forward against Kerk's hands, as if they were the only things\nthat stopped her from leaping at Jason.\n\n\"Maybe that is too much to assimilate at one sitting,\" Jason said. \"So\nlet's put it in simpler terms. I believe we can find a reason for this\nunrelenting hatred of humans. Perhaps we don't smell right. Maybe I'll\nfind an essence of crushed Pyrran bugs that will render us immune when\nwe rub it in. I don't know yet. But whatever the results, we _must_ make\nthe investigation. Kerk agrees with me on that.\"\n\nMeta looked at Kerk and he nodded agreement. Her shoulders slumped in\nsudden defeat. She whispered the words.\n\n\"I ... can't say I agree, or even understand all that you said. But I'll\nhelp you. If Kerk thinks that it is the right thing.\"\n\n\"I do,\" he said. \"Now, do you want the clip back for your gun? Not\nplanning to take any more shots at Jason?\"\n\n\"That was foolish of me,\" she said coldly while she reloaded the gun. \"I\ndon't need a gun. If I had to kill him, I could do it with my bare\nhands.\"\n\n\"I love you, too,\" Jason smiled at her. \"Are you ready to go now?\"\n\n\"Of course.\" She brushed a fluffy curl of hair into place. \"First we'll\nfind a place where you can stay. I'll take care of that. After that the\nwork of the new department is up to you.\"\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nThere were empty rooms in one of the computer buildings. These were\ncompletely sealed to keep stray animal life out of the delicate\nmachinery. While Meta checked a bed-roll out of stores, Jason painfully\ndragged a desk, table and chairs in from a nearby empty office. When she\nreturned with a pneumatic bed he instantly dropped on it with a grateful\nsigh. Her lip curled a bit at his obvious weakness.\n\n\"Get used to the sight,\" he said. \"I intend to do as much of my work as\nI can, while maintaining a horizontal position. You will be my strong\nright arm. And right now, Right Arm, I wish you could scare me up\nsomething to eat. I also intend to do most of my eating in the\npreviously mentioned prone condition.\"\n\nSnorting with disgust, Meta stamped out. While she was gone, Jason\nchewed the end of a stylus thoughtfully, then made some careful notes.\n\nAfter they had finished the almost-tasteless meal he began the search.\n\n\"Meta, where can I find historical records of Pyrrus?\"\n\n\"I've never heard of any ... I really don't know.\"\n\n\"But there has to be something--_somewhere_,\" he insisted. \"Even if your\npresent-day culture devotes all of its time and energies to survival,\nyou can be sure it wasn't always that way. All the time it was\ndeveloping, people were keeping records, making notes. Now where do we\nlook? Do you have a library here?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she said. \"We have an excellent technical library. But I'm\nsure there wouldn't be any of _that_ sort of thing there.\"\n\nTrying not to groan, Jason stood up. \"Let me be the judge of that. Just\nlead the way.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOperation of the library was completely automatic. A projected index\ngave the call number for any text that had to be consulted. The tape\nwas delivered to the charge desk thirty seconds after the number had\nbeen punched. Returned tapes were dropped through a hopper and refiled\nautomatically. The mechanism worked smoothly.\n\n\"Wonderful,\" Jason said, pushing away from the index. \"A tribute to\ntechnological ingenuity. Only it contains nothing of any value to us.\nJust reams of textbooks.\"\n\n\"What _else_ should be in a library?\" Meta sounded sincerely puzzled.\n\nJason started to explain, then changed his mind. \"Later we will go into\nthat,\" he said. \"Much later. Now we have to find a lead. Is it possible\nthat there are any tapes--or even printed books--that aren't filed\nthrough this machine?\"\n\n\"It seems unlikely, but we could ask Poli. He lives here somewhere and\nis in charge of the library--filing new books and tending the\nmachinery.\"\n\nThe single door into the rear of the building was locked, and no amount\nof pounding could rouse the caretaker.\n\n\"If he's alive, this should do it,\" Jason said. He pressed the\nout-of-order button on the control panel. It had the desired affect.\nWithin five minutes the door opened and Poli dragged himself through it.\n\nDeath usually came swiftly on Pyrrus. If wounds slowed a man down, the\never-ready forces of destruction quickly finished the job. Poli was the\nexception to this rule. Whatever had attacked him originally had done an\nefficient job. Most of the lower part of his face was gone. His left arm\nwas curled and useless. The damage to his body and legs had left him\nwith the bare capability to stumble from one spot to the next.\n\nYet he still had one good arm as well as his eyesight. He could work in\nthe library and relieve a fully fit man. How long he had been dragging\nthe useless husk of a body around the building, no one knew. In spite of\nthe pain that filled his red-rimmed, moist eyes, he had stayed alive.\nGrowing old, older than any other Pyrran as far as Jason had seen. He\ntottered forward and turned off the alarm that had called him.\n\nWhen Jason started to explain the old man took no notice. Only after the\nlibrarian had rummaged a hearing aid out of his clothes, did Jason\nrealize he was deaf as well. Jason explained again what he searched for.\nPoli nodded and printed his answer on a tablet.\n\n_there are many old books--in the storerooms below_\n\nMost of the building was taken up by the robot filing and sorting\napparatus. They moved slowly through the banks of machinery, following\nthe crippled librarian to a barred door in the rear. He pointed to it.\nWhile Jason and Meta fought to open the age-incrusted bars, he wrote\nanother note on his tablet.\n\n_not opened for many years, rats_\n\nJason's and Meta's guns appeared reflexively in their hands as they read\nthe message. Jason finished opening the door by himself. The two native\nPyrrans stood facing the opening gap. It was well they did. Jason could\nnever have handled what came through that door.\n\nHe didn't even open it for himself. Their sounds at the door must have\nattracted all the vermin in the lower part of the building. Jason had\nthrown the last bolt and started to pull on the handle--when the door\nwas _pushed_ open from the other side.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOpen the gateway to hell and see what comes out. Meta and Poli stood\nshoulder to shoulder firing into the mass of loathsomeness that boiled\nthrough the door. Jason jumped to one side and picked off the occasional\nanimal that came his way. The destruction seemed to go on forever.\n\nLong minutes passed before the last clawed beast made its death rush.\nMeta and Poli waited expectantly for more, they were happily excited by\nthis chance to deal destruction. Jason felt a little sick after the\nsilent ferocious attack. A ferocity that the Pyrrans reflected. He saw a\nscratch on Meta's face where one of the beasts had caught her. She\nseemed oblivious to it.\n\nPulling out his medikit, Jason circled the piled bodies. Something\nstirred in their midst and a crashing shot ploughed into it. Then he\nreached the girl and pushed the analyzer probes against the scratch. The\nmachine clicked and Meta jumped as the antitoxin needle stabbed down.\nShe realized for the first time what Jason was doing.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said.\n\nPoli had a powerful battery lamp and, by unspoken agreement, Jason\ncarried it. Crippled though he was, the old man was still a Pyrran when\nit came to handling a gun. They slowly made their way down the\nrefuse-laden stairs.\n\n\"What a stench,\" Jason grimaced.\n\nAt the foot of the stairs they looked around. There _had_ been books and\nrecords there at one time. They had been systematically chewed, eaten\nand destroyed for decades.\n\n\"I like the care you take with your old books,\" Jason said disgustedly.\n\n\"They could have been of no importance,\" Meta said coolly, \"or they\nwould be filed correctly in the library upstairs.\"\n\nJason wandered gloomily through the rooms. Nothing remained of any\nvalue. Fragments and scraps of writing and printing. Never enough in one\nspot to bother collecting. With the toe of one armored boot, he kicked\nangrily at a pile of debris, ready to give up the search. There was a\nglint of rusty metal under the dirt.\n\n\"Hold this!\" He gave the light to Meta and began scratching aside the\nrubble. A flat metal box with a dial lock built into it, was revealed.\n\n\"Why that's a log box!\" Meta said, surprised.\n\n\"That's what I thought,\" Jason said.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nResealing the cellar, they carried the box back to Jason's new office.\nOnly after spraying with decontaminant, did they examine it closely.\nMeta picked out engraved letters on the lid.\n\n\"S. T. POLLUX VICTORY--that must be the name of the spacer this log came\nfrom. But I don't recognize the class, or whatever it is the initials\n_S. T._ stand for.\"\n\n\"Stellar Transport,\" Jason told her, as he tried the lock mechanism.\n\"I've heard of them but I've never seen one. They were built during the\nlast wave of galactic expansion. Really nothing more than gigantic metal\ncontainers, put together in space. After they were loaded with people,\nmachinery and supplies, they would be towed to whatever planetary system\nhad been chosen. These same tugs and one-shot rockets would brake the\nS. T.'s in for a landing. Then leave them there. The hull was a ready\nsource of metal and the colonists could start right in building their\nnew world. And they were _big_. All of them held at least fifty thousand\npeople ...\"\n\nOnly after he said it, did he realize the significance of his words.\nMeta's deadly stare drove it home. There were now less people on Pyrrus\nthan had been in the original settlement.\n\nAnd human population, without rigid birth controls, usually increased\ngeometrically. Jason dinAlt suddenly remembered Meta's itchy trigger\nfinger.\n\n\"But we can't be sure how many people were aboard this one,\" he said\nhurriedly. \"Or even if this is the log of the ship that settled Pyrrus.\nCan you find something to pry this open with? The lock is corroded into\na single lump.\"\n\nMeta took her anger out on the box. Her fingers managed to force a gap\nbetween lid and bottom. She wrenched at it. Rusty metal screeched and\ntore. The lid came off in her hands and a heavy book thudded to the\ntable.\n\nThe cover legend destroyed all doubt.\n\n    LOG OF S. T. POLLUX VICTORY. OUTWARD BOUND--SETANI TO PYRRUS. 55,000\n    SETTLERS ABOARD.\n\nMeta couldn't argue now. She stood behind Jason with tight-clenched\nfists and read over his shoulder as he turned the brittle, yellowed\npages. He quickly skipped through the opening part that covered the\nsailing preparations and trip out. Only when he had reached the actual\nlanding did he start reading slowly. The impact of the ancient words\nleaped out at him.\n\n\"Here it is,\" Jason shouted. \"Proof positive that we're on the right\ntrail. Even _you_ will have to admit that. Read it, right here.\"\n\n    _... Second day since the tugs left, we are completely on our own\n    now. The settlers still haven't grown used to this planet, though we\n    have orientation talks every night. As well as the morale agents who\n    I have working twenty hours a day. I suppose I really can't blame\n    the people, they all lived in the underways of Setani and I doubt if\n    they saw the sun once a year. This planet has weather with a\n    vengeance, worse than anything I've seen on a hundred other planets.\n    Was I wrong during the original planning stages not to insist on\n    settlers from one of the agrarian worlds? People who could handle\n    the outdoors._\n\n    _These citified Setanians are afraid to go out in the rain. But of\n    course they have adapted completely to their native 1.5 gravity so\n    the two gee here doesn't bother them much. That was the factor that\n    decided us. Anyway--too late now to do anything about it. Or about\n    the unending cycle of rain, snow, hail, hurricanes and such. Answer\n    will be to start the mines going, sell the metals and build\n    completely enclosed cities._\n\n    _The only thing on this forsaken planet that isn't actually against\n    us are the animals. A few large predators at first, but the guards\n    made short work of them. The rest of the wild life leaves us alone.\n    Glad of that! They have been fighting for existence so long that I\n    have never seen a more deadly looking collection. Even the little\n    rodents no bigger than a man's hand are armored like tanks ..._\n\n\"I don't believe a word of it,\" Meta broke in. \"That can't be Pyrrus\nhe's writing about ...\" Her words died away as Jason wordlessly pointed\nto the title on the cover.\n\nHe continued scanning the pages, flipping them quickly. A sentence\ncaught his eye and he stopped. Jamming his finger against the place, he\nread aloud.\n\n\"'... And troubles keep piling up. First Har Palo with his theory that\nthe vulcanism is so close to the surface that the ground keeps warm and\nthe crops grow so well. Even if he is right--what can we do? We must be\nself-dependent if we intend to survive. And now this other thing. It\nseems that the forest fire drove a lot of new species our way. Animals,\ninsects and even birds have attacked the people. (Note for Har: check if\npossible seasonal migration might explain attacks.) There have been\nfourteen deaths from wounds and poisoning. We'll have to enforce the\nrules for insect lotion at all times. And I suppose build some kind of\nperimeter defense to keep the larger beasts out of the camp.'\n\n\"This is a beginning,\" Jason said. \"At least now we are aware of the\nreal nature of the battle we're engaged in. It doesn't make Pyrrus any\neasier to handle, or make the life forms less dangerous, to know that\nthey were once better disposed towards mankind. All this does is point\nthe way. Something took the peaceful life forms, shook them up, and\nturned this planet into one big deathtrap for mankind. That _something_\nis what I want to uncover.\"\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n\nFurther reading of the log produced no new evidence. There was a good\ndeal more information about the early animal and plant life and how\ndeadly they were, as well as the first defenses against them.\nInteresting historically, but of no use whatsoever in countering the\nmenace. The captain apparently never thought that life forms were\naltering on Pyrrus, believing instead that dangerous beasts were being\ndiscovered. He never lived to change his mind. The last entry in the\nlog, less than two months after the first attack, was very brief. And\nin a different handwriting.\n\n    _Captain Kurkowski died today, of poisoning following an insect\n    bite. His death is greatly mourned._\n\nThe \"why\" of the planetary revulsion had yet to be uncovered.\n\n\"Kerk must see this book,\" Jason said. \"He should have some idea of the\nprogress being made. Can we get transportation--or do we walk to city\nhall?\"\n\n\"Walk, of course,\" Meta said.\n\n\"Then you bring the book. At two G's I find it very hard to be a\ngentleman and carry the packages.\"\n\nThey had just entered Kerk's outer office when a shrill screaming burst\nout of the phone-screen. It took Jason a moment to realize that it was a\nmechanical signal, not a human voice.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked.\n\nKerk burst through the door and headed for the street entrance. Everyone\nelse in the office was going the same way. Meta looked confused, leaning\ntowards the door, then looking back at Jason.\n\n\"What does it mean? Can't you tell me?\" He shook her arm.\n\n\"Sector alarm. A major breakthrough of some kind at the perimeter.\nEveryone but other perimeter guards has to answer.\"\n\n\"Well, go then,\" he said. \"Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.\"\n\nHis words acted like a trigger release. Meta's gun was in her hand and\nshe was gone before he had finished speaking. Jason sat down wearily in\nthe deserted office.\n\nThe unnatural silence in the building began to get on his nerves. He\nshifted his chair over to the phone-screen and switched it on to\n_receive_. The screen exploded with color and sound. At first Jason\ncould make no sense of it at all. Just a confused jumble of faces and\nvoices. It was a multi-channel set designed for military use. A number\nof images were carried on the screen at one time, rows of heads or hazy\nbackgrounds where the user had left the field of view. Many of the heads\nwere talking at the same time and the babble of their voices made no\nsense whatsoever.\n\nAfter examining the controls and making a few experiments, Jason began\nto understand the operation. Though all stations were on the screen at\nall times, their audio channels could be controlled. In that way two,\nthree or more stations could be hooked together in a link-up. They would\nbe in round-robin communication with each other, yet never out of\ncontact with the other stations.\n\nIdentification between voice and sound was automatic. Whenever one of\nthe pictured images spoke, the image would glow red. By trial and error\nJason brought in the audio for the stations he wanted and tried to\nfollow the course of the attack.\n\nVery quickly he realized this was something out of the ordinary. In some\nway, no one made it clear, a section of the perimeter had been broken\nthrough and emergency defenses had to be thrown up to encapsulate it.\nKerk seemed to be in charge, at least he was the only one with an\noverride transmitter. He used it for general commands. The many, tiny\nimages faded and his face appeared on top of them, filling the entire\nscreen.\n\n\"All perimeter stations send twenty-five per cent of your complement to\nArea Twelve.\"\n\nThe small images reappeared and the babble increased, red lights\nflickering from face to face.\n\n\"... Abandon the first floor, acid bombs can't reach.\"\n\n\"If we hold we'll be cut off, but salient is past us on the west flank.\nRequest support.\"\n\n\"DON'T MERVV ... IT'S USELESS!\"\n\n\"... And the napalm tanks are almost gone. Orders?\"\n\n\"The truck is still there, get it to the supply warehouse, you'll find\nreplacements ...\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOut of the welter of talk, only the last two fragments made any sense.\nJason had noticed the signs below when he came in. The first two floors\nof the building below him were jammed with military supplies. This was\nhis chance to get into the act.\n\nJust sitting and watching was frustrating. Particularly when it was a\ndesperate emergency. He didn't overvalue his worth, but he was sure\nthere was always room for another gun.\n\nBy the time he had dragged himself down to the street level a\nturbo-truck had slammed to a stop in front of the loading platform. Two\nPyrrans were rolling out drums of napalm with reckless disregard for\ntheir own safety. Jason didn't dare enter that maelstrom of rolling\nmetal. He found he could be of use tugging the heavy drums into position\non the truck while the others rolled them up. They accepted his aid\nwithout acknowledgment.\n\nIt was exhausting, sweaty work, hauling the leaden drums into place\nagainst the heavy gravity. After a minute Jason worked by touch through\na red haze of hammering blood. He realized the job was done only when\nthe truck suddenly leaped forward and he was thrown to the floor. He lay\nthere, his chest heaving. As the driver hurled the heavy vehicle along,\nall Jason could do was bounce around in the bottom. He could see well\nenough, but was still gasping for breath when they braked at the\nfighting zone.\n\nTo Jason, it was a scene of incredible confusion. Guns firing, flames,\nmen and women running on all sides. The napalm drums were unloaded\nwithout his help and the truck vanished for more. Jason leaned against a\nwall of a half-destroyed building and tried to get his bearings. It was\nimpossible. There seemed to be a great number of small animals: he\nkilled two that attacked him. Other than that he couldn't determine the\nnature of the battle.\n\nA Pyrran, tan face white with pain and exertion, stumbled up. His right\narm, wet with raw flesh and dripping blood, hung limply at his side. It\nwas covered with freshly applied surgical foam. He held his gun in his\nleft hand, a stump of control cable dangling from it. Jason thought the\nman was looking for medical aid. He couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nClenching the gun in his teeth, the Pyrran clutched a barrel of napalm\nwith his good hand and hurled it over on its side. Then, with the gun\nonce more in his hand, he began to roll the drum along the ground with\nhis feet. It was slow, cumbersome work, but he was still in the fight.\n\nJason pushed through the hurrying crowd and bent over the drum. \"Let me\ndo it,\" he said. \"You can cover us both with your gun.\"\n\nThe man wiped the sweat from his eyes with the back of his arm and\nblinked at Jason. He seemed to recognize him. When he smiled it was a\ngrimace of pain, empty of humor. \"Do that. I can still shoot. Two half\nmen--maybe we equal one whole.\" Jason was laboring too hard to even\nnotice the insult.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn explosion had blasted a raw pit in the street ahead. Two people were\nat the bottom, digging it even deeper with shovels. The whole thing\nseemed meaningless. Just as Jason and the wounded man rolled up the drum\nthe diggers leaped out of the excavation and began shooting down into\nits depths. One of them turned, a young girl, barely in her teens.\n\n\"Praise Perimeter!\" she breathed. \"They found the napalm. One of the new\nhorrors is breaking through towards Thirteen, we just found it.\" Even as\nshe talked she swiveled the drum around, kicked the easy-off plug, and\nbegan dumping the gelid contents into the hole. When half of it had\ngurgled down, she kicked the drum itself in. Her companion pulled a\nflare from his belt, lit it, and threw it after the drum.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Back quick. They don't like heat,\" he said.\n\nThis was putting it very mildly. The napalm caught, tongues of flame and\nroiling, greasy smoke climbed up to the sky. Under Jason's feet the\nearth shifted and moved. _Something_ black and long stirred in the heart\nof the flame, then arched up into the sky over their heads. In the midst\nof the searing heat it still moved with alien, jolting motions. It was\nimmense, at least two meters thick and with no indication of its length.\nThe flames didn't stop it at all, just annoyed it.\n\nJason had some idea of the thing's length as the street cracked and\nbuckled for fifty meters on each side of the pit. Great loops of the\ncreature began to emerge from the ground. He fired his gun, as did the\nothers. Not that it seemed to have any effect. More and more people were\nappearing, armed with a variety of weapons. Flame-throwers and grenades\nseemed to be the most effective.\n\n\"_Clear the area ... we're going to saturate it. Fall back._\"\n\nThe voice was so loud it jarred Jason's ear. He turned and recognized\nKerk, who had arrived with truckloads of equipment. He had a power\nspeaker on his back, the mike hung in front of his lips. His amplified\nvoice brought an instant reaction from the crowd. They began to move.\n\nThere was still doubt in Jason's mind what to do. Clear the area? But\nwhat area? He started towards Kerk, before he realized that the rest of\nthe Pyrrans were going in the opposite direction. Even under two\ngravities they _moved_.\n\nJason had a naked feeling of being alone on the stage. He was in the\ncenter of the street, and the others had vanished. No one remained.\nExcept the wounded man Jason had helped. He stumbled towards Jason,\nwaving his good arm. Jason couldn't understand what he said. Kerk was\nshouting orders again from one of the trucks. They had started to move\ntoo. The urgency struck home and Jason started to run.\n\nIt was too late. On all sides the earth was buckling, cracking, as more\nloops of the underground thing forced its way into the light. Safety lay\nahead. Only in front of it rose an arch of dirt-encrusted gray.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere are seconds of time that seem to last an eternity. A moment of\nsubjective time that is grabbed and stretched to an infinite distance.\nThis was one of those moments. Jason stood, frozen. Even the smoke in\nthe sky hung unmoving. The high-standing loop of alien life was before\nhim, every detail piercingly clear.\n\nThick as a man, ribbed and gray as old bark. Tendrils projected from all\nparts of it, pallid and twisting lengths that writhed slowly with\nsnakelike life. Shaped like a plant, yet with the motions of an animal.\nAnd cracking, splitting. This was the worst.\n\nSeams and openings appeared. Splintering, gaping mouths that vomited out\na horde of pallid animals. Jason heard their shriekings, shrill yet\nremote. He saw the needlelike teeth that lined their jaws.\n\nThe paralysis of the unknown held him there. He should have died. Kerk\nwas thundering at him through the power speaker, others were firing into\nthe attacking creature. Jason knew nothing.\n\nThen he was shot forward, pushed by a rock-hard shoulder. The wounded\nman was still there, trying to get Jason clear. Gun clenched in his jaws\nhe dragged Jason along with his good arm. Towards the creature. The\nothers stopped firing. They saw his plan and it was a good one.\n\nA loop of the thing arched into the air, leaving an opening between its\nbody and the ground. The wounded Pyrran planted his feet and tightened\nhis muscles. One-handed, with a single thrust, he picked Jason off the\nground and sent him hurtling under the living arch. Moving tendrils\nbrushed fire along his face, then he was through, rolling over and over\non the ground. The wounded Pyrran leaped after him.\n\nIt was too late. There had been a chance for one person to get out. The\nPyrran could have done it easily--instead he had pushed Jason first. The\nthing was aware of movement when Jason brushed its tendrils. It dropped\nand caught the wounded man under its weight. He vanished from sight as\nthe tendrils wrapped around him and the animals swarmed over. His\ntrigger must have pulled back to full automatic because the gun kept\nfiring a long time after he should have been dead.\n\nJason crawled. Some of the fanged animals ran towards him, but were\nshot. He knew nothing about this. Then rude hands grabbed him up and\npulled him forward. He slammed into the side of a truck and Kerk's face\nwas in front of his, flushed and angry. One of the giant fists closed on\nthe front of Jason's clothes and he was lifted off his feet, shaken like\na limp bag of rags. He offered no protest and could not have even if\nKerk had killed him.\n\nWhen he was thrown to the ground, someone picked him up and slid him\ninto the back of the truck. He did not lose consciousness as the truck\nbounced away, yet he could not move. In a moment the fatigue would go\naway and he would sit up. That was all he was, just a little tired. Even\nas he thought this he passed out.\n\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\n\n\"Just like old times,\" Jason said when Brucco came into the room with a\ntray of food. Without a word Brucco served Jason and the wounded men in\nthe other beds, then left. \"Thanks,\" Jason called after his retreating\nback.\n\nA joke, a twist of a grin, like it always was. Sure. But even as he\ngrinned and his lips shaped a joke, Jason felt them like a veneer on\nthe outside. Something plastered on with a life of its own. Inside he\nwas numb and immovable. His body was stiff as his eyes still watched\nthat arch of alien flesh descend and smother the one-armed Pyrran with\nits million burning fingers.\n\nHe could feel himself under the arch. After all, hadn't the wounded man\ntaken his place? He finished the meal without realizing that he ate.\n\nEver since that morning, when he had recovered consciousness, it had\nbeen like this. He knew that he should have died out there in that\nbattle-torn street. _His_ life should have been snuffed out, for making\nthe mistake of thinking that he could actually help the battling\nPyrrans. Instead of being underfoot and in the way. If it hadn't been\nfor Jason, the man with the wounded arm would have been brought here to\nthe safety of the reorientation buildings. He knew he was lying in the\nbed that belonged to that man.\n\nThe man who had given his life for Jason's.\n\nThe man whose name he didn't even know.\n\nThere were drugs in the food and they made him sleep. The medicated pads\nsoaked the pain and rawness out of the burns where the tentacles had\nseared his face. When he awoke the second time, his touch with reality\nhad been restored.\n\nA man had died so he could live. Jason faced the fact. He couldn't\nrestore that life, no matter how much he wanted to. What he could do was\nmake the man's death worth while. If it can be said that any death was\nworth while ... He forced his thoughts from that track.\n\nJason knew what he had to do. His work was even more important now. If\nhe could solve the riddle of this deadly world, he could repay in part\nthe debt he owed.\n\nSitting up made his head spin and he held to the edge of the bed until\nit slowed down. The others in the room ignored him as he slowly and\npainfully dragged on his clothes. Brucco came in, saw what he was doing,\nand left again without a word.\n\nDressing took a long time, but it was finally done. When Jason finally\nleft the room he found Kerk waiting for him.\n\n\"Kerk ... I want to tell you ...\"\n\n\"Tell me _nothing_!\" The thunder of Kerk's voice bounced back from the\nceiling and walls. \"I'm telling _you_. I'll tell you once and that will\nbe the end of it. You're not wanted on Pyrrus, Jason dinAlt, neither you\nnor your precious off-world schemes are wanted here. I let you convince\nme once with your twisted tongue. Helped you at the expense of more\nimportant work. I should have known what the result of your 'logic'\nwould be. Now I've seen. Welf died so you could live. He was twice the\nman you will ever be.\"\n\n\"Welf? Was that his name?\" Jason asked stumblingly. \"I didn't know--\"\n\n\"You didn't even know.\" Kerk's lips pulled back from his teeth in a\ngrimace of disgust. \"You didn't even know his name--yet he died that\nyou might continue your miserable existence.\" Kerk spat, as if the words\ngave a vile flavor to his speech, and stamped towards the exit lock.\nAlmost as an afterthought he turned back to Jason.\n\n\"You'll stay here in the sealed buildings until the ship returns in two\nweeks. Then you will leave this planet and never come back. If you do,\nI'll kill you instantly. With pleasure.\" He started through the lock.\n\n\"Wait,\" Jason shouted. \"You can't decide like that. You haven't even\nseen the evidence I've uncovered. Ask Meta--\" The lock thumped shut and\nKerk was gone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe whole thing was just too stupid. Anger began to replace the futile\ndespair of a moment before. He was being treated like an irresponsible\nchild, the importance of his discovery of the log completely ignored.\n\nJason turned and saw for the first time that Brucco was standing there.\n\"Did you hear that?\" Jason asked him.\n\n\"Yes. And I quite agree. You can consider yourself lucky.\"\n\n\"Lucky!\" Jason was the angry one now. \"Lucky to be treated like a\nmoronic child, with contempt for everything I do--\"\n\n\"I said lucky,\" Brucco snapped. \"Welf was Kerk's only surviving son.\nKerk had high hopes for him, was training him to take his place\neventually.\" He turned to leave but Jason called after him.\n\n\"Wait. I'm sorry about Welf. I can't be any sorrier knowing that he was\nKerk's son. But at least it explains why Kerk is so quick to throw me\nout--as well as the evidence I have uncovered. The log of the ship--\"\n\n\"I know, I've seen it,\" Brucco said. \"Meta brought it in. Very\ninteresting historical document.\"\n\n\"That's all you can see it as--an historical document? The significance\nof the planetary change escapes you?\"\n\n\"It doesn't escape me,\" Brucco answered briefly, \"but I cannot see that\nit has any relevancy today. The past is unchangeable and we must fight\nin the present. That is enough to occupy all our energies.\"\n\nJason felt too exhausted to argue the point any more. He ran into the\nsame stone wall with all the Pyrrans. Theirs was a logic of the moment.\nThe past and the future unchangeable, unknowable--and uninteresting.\n\"How is the perimeter battle going?\" he asked, wanting to change the\nsubject.\n\n\"Finished. Or in the last stages at least,\" Brucco was almost\nenthusiastic as he showed Jason some stereos of the attackers. He did\nnot notice Jason's repressed shudder.\n\n\"This was one of the most serious breakthroughs in years, but we caught\nit in time. I hate to think what would have happened if they hadn't been\ndetected for a few weeks more.\"\n\n\"What are those things?\" Jason asked. \"Giant snakes of some kind?\"\n\n\"Don't be absurd,\" Brucco snorted. He tapped the stereo with his\nthumbnail. \"Roots. That's all. Greatly modified, but still roots. They\ncame in under the perimeter barrier, much deeper than anything we've had\nbefore. Not a real threat in themselves as they have very little\nmobility. Die soon after being cut. The danger came from their being\nused as access tunnels. They're bored through and through with animal\nruns, and two or three species of beasts live in a sort of symbiosis\ninside.\n\n\"Now we know what they are we can watch for them. The danger was they\ncould have completely undermined the perimeter and come in from all\nsides at once. Not much we could have done then.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe edge of destruction. Living on the lip of a volcano. The Pyrrans\ntook satisfaction from any day that passed without total annihilation.\nThere seemed no way to change their attitude. Jason let the conversation\ndie there. He picked up the log of the _Pollux Victory_ from Brucco's\nquarters and carried it back to his room. The wounded Pyrrans there\nignored him as he dropped onto the bed and opened the book to the first\npage.\n\nFor two days he did not leave his quarters. The wounded men were soon\ngone and he had the room to himself. Page by page he went through the\nlog, until he knew every detail of the settlement of Pyrrus. His notes\nand cross-references piled up. He made an accurate map of the original\nsettlement, superimposed over a modern one. They didn't match at all.\n\nIt was a dead end. With one map held over the other, what he had\nsuspected was painfully clear. The descriptions of terrain and physical\nfeatures in the log were accurate enough. The city had obviously been\nmoved since the first landing. Whatever records had been kept would be\nin the library--and he had exhausted that source. Anything else would\nhave been left behind and long since destroyed.\n\nRain lashed against the thick window above his head, lit suddenly by a\nflare of lightning. The unseen volcanoes were active again, vibrating\nthe floor with their rumblings deep in the earth.\n\nThe shadow of defeat pressed heavily down on Jason. Rounding his\nshoulders and darkening, even more, the overcast day.\n\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\n\nJason spent one depressed day lying on his bunk counting rivets, forcing\nhimself to accept defeat. Kerk's order that he was not to leave the\nsealed building tied his hands completely. He felt himself close to the\nanswer--but he was never going to get it.\n\nOne day of defeat was all he could take. Kerk's attitude was completely\nemotional, untempered by the slightest touch of logic. This fact kept\ndriving home until Jason could no longer ignore it. Emotional reasoning\nwas something he had learned to mistrust early in life. He couldn't\nagree with Kerk in the slightest--which meant he had to utilize the ten\nremaining days to solve the problem. If it meant disobeying Kerk, it\nwould still have to be done.\n\nHe grabbed up his noteplate with a new enthusiasm. His first sources of\ninformation had been used up, but there must be others. Chewing the\nscriber and needling his brain, he slowly built up a list of other\npossibilities. Any idea, no matter how wild, was put down. When the\nplate was filled he wiped the long shots and impossibles--such as\nconsulting off-world historical records. This was a Pyrran problem, and\nhad to be settled on this planet or not at all.\n\nThe list worked down to two probables. Either old records, notebooks or\ndiaries that individual Pyrrans might have in their possession, or\nverbal histories that had been passed down the generations by word of\nmouth. The first choice seemed to be the most probable and he acted on\nit at once. After a careful check of his medikit and gun he went to see\nBrucco.\n\n\"What's new and deadly in the world since I left?\" he asked.\n\nBrucco glared at him. \"You can't go out, Kerk has forbidden it.\"\n\n\"Did he put you in charge of guarding me to see if I obeyed?\" Jason's\nvoice was quiet and cold.\n\nBrucco rubbed his jaw and frowned in thought. Finally he just shrugged.\n\"No, I'm not guarding you--nor do I want the job. As far as I know this\nis between you and Kerk and it can stay that way. Leave whenever you\nwant. And get yourself killed quietly some place so there will be an end\nto the trouble you cause once and for all.\"\n\n\"I love you, too,\" Jason said. \"Now brief me on the wildlife.\"\n\nThe only new mutation that routine precautions wouldn't take care of was\na slate-colored lizard that spit a fast nerve poison with deadly\naccuracy. Death took place in seconds if the saliva touched any bare\nskin. The lizards had to be looked out for, and shot before they came\nwithin range. An hour of lizard-blasting in a training chamber made him\nproficient in the exact procedure.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJason left the sealed buildings quietly and no one saw him go. He\nfollowed the map to the nearest barracks, shuffling tiredly through the\ndusty streets. It was a hot, quiet afternoon, broken only by rumblings\nfrom the distance, and the occasional crack of his gun.\n\nIt was cool inside the thick-walled barracks buildings, and he collapsed\nonto a bench until the sweat dried and his heart stopped pounding. Then\nhe went to the nearest recreation room to start his search.\n\nBefore it began it was finished. None of the Pyrrans kept old artifacts\nof any kind and thought the whole idea was very funny. After the\ntwentieth negative answer Jason was ready to admit defeat in this line\nof investigation. There was as much chance of meeting a Pyrran with old\ndocuments as finding a bundle of grandfather's letters in a soldier's\nkit bag.\n\nThis left a single possibility--verbal histories. Again Jason questioned\nwith the same lack of results. The fun had worn off the game for the\nPyrrans and they were beginning to growl. Jason stopped while he was\nstill in one piece. The commissary served him a meal that tasted like\nplastic paste and wood pulp. He ate it quickly, then sat brooding over\nthe empty tray, hating to admit to another dead end. Who could supply\nhim with answers? All the people he had talked to were so young. They\nhad no interest or patience for story-telling. That was an old folks'\nhobby--and there were no oldsters on Pyrrus.\n\nWith one exception that he knew of, the librarian, Poli. It was a\npossibility. A man who worked with records and books might have an\ninterest in some of the older ones. He might even remember reading\nvolumes now destroyed. A very slim lead indeed, but one that had to be\npursued.\n\nWalking to the library almost killed Jason. The torrential rains made\nthe footing bad, and in the dim light it was hard to see what was\ncoming. A snapper came in close enough to take out a chunk of flesh\nbefore he could blast it. The antitoxin made him dizzy and he lost some\nblood before he could get the wound dressed. He reached the library,\nexhausted and angry.\n\nPoli was working on the guts of one of the catalogue machines. He didn't\nstop until Jason had tapped him on the shoulder. Switching on his\nhearing aid, the Pyrran stood quietly, crippled and bent, waiting for\nJason to talk.\n\n\"Have you any old papers or letters that you have kept for your personal\nuse?\"\n\nA shake of the head, _no_.\n\n\"What about stories--you know, about great things that have happened in\nthe past, that someone might have told you when you were young?\"\nNegative.\n\nResults negative. Every question was answered by a shake of Poli's head,\nand very soon the old man grew irritated and pointed to the work he\nhadn't finished.\n\n\"Yes, I know you have work to do,\" Jason said. \"But this is important.\"\nPoli shook his head an angry _no_ and reached to turn off his hearing\naid. Jason groped for a question that might get a more positive answer.\nThere was something tugging at his mind, a word he had heard and made a\nnote of, to be investigated later. Something that Kerk had said ...\n\n\"That's it!\" It was right there--on the tip of his tongue. \"Just a\nsecond, Poli, just one more question. What is a 'grubber'? Have you ever\nseen one or know what they do, or where they can be found--\"\n\nThe words were cut off as Poli whirled and lashed the back of his good\narm into Jason's face. Though the man was aged and crippled, the blow\nalmost fractured Jason's jaw, sending him sliding across the floor.\nThrough a daze he saw Poli hobbling towards him, making thick bubbling\nnoises in his ruined throat; what remained of his face twisted and\nworking with anger.\n\nThis was no time for diplomacy. Moving as fast as he could, with the\nhigh-G, foot-slapping shuffle, Jason headed for the sealed door. He was\nno match for any Pyrran in hand-to-hand combat, young and small or old\nand crippled. The door thunked open, as he went through, and barely\nclosed in Poli's face.\n\nOutside the rain had turned to snow and Jason trudged wearily through\nthe slush, rubbing his sore jaw and turning over the only fact he had.\n_Grubber_ was a key--but to what? And who did he dare ask for more\ninformation? Kerk was the man he had talked to best, but not any more.\nThat left only Meta as a possible source. He wanted to see her at once,\nbut sudden exhaustion swept through him. It took all of his strength to\nstumble back to the school buildings.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the morning he ate and left early. There was only a week left. It was\nimpossible to hurry and he cursed as he dragged his double-weight body\nto the assignment center. Meta was on night perimeter duty and should\nbe back to her quarters soon. He shuffled over there and was lying on\nher bunk when she came in.\n\n\"Get out,\" she said in a flat voice. \"Or do I throw you out?\"\n\n\"Patience, please,\" he said as he sat up. \"Just resting here until you\ncame back. I have a single question, and if you will answer it for me\nI'll go and stop bothering you.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked, tapping her foot with impatience. But there was\nalso a touch of curiosity in her voice. Jason thought carefully before\nhe spoke.\n\n\"Now _please_, don't shoot me. You know I'm an off-worlder with a big\nmouth, and you have heard me say some awful things without taking a shot\nat me. Now I have another one. Will you please show your superiority to\nthe other people of the galaxy by holding your temper and not reducing\nme to component atoms?\"\n\nHis only answer was a tap of the foot, so he took a deep breath and\nplunged in.\n\n\"What is a 'grubber'?\"\n\nFor a long moment she was quiet, unmoving. Then she curled her lips back\nin disgust. \"You find the most repulsive topics.\"\n\n\"That may be so,\" he said, \"but it still doesn't answer my question.\"\n\n\"It's ... well, the sort of thing people just don't talk about.\"\n\n\"I do,\" he assured her.\n\n\"Well, I _don't_! It's the most disgusting thing in the world, and\nthat's all I'm going to say. Talk to Krannon, but not to me.\" She had\nhim by the arm while she talked and he was half dragged to the hall. The\ndoor slammed behind him and he muttered \"_lady wrestler_\" under his\nbreath. His anger ebbed away as he realized that she had given him a\nclue in spite of herself. Next step, find out who or what Krannon was.\n\nAssignment center listed a man named Krannon, and gave his shift number\nand work location. It was close by and Jason walked there. A large,\ncubical, and windowless building, with the single word _food_ next to\neach of the sealed entrances. The small entrance he went through was a\nseries of automatic chambers that cycled him through ultrasonics,\nultraviolet, antibio spray, rotating brushes and three final rinses. He\nwas finally admitted, damper but much cleaner to the central area. Men\nand robots were stacking crates and he asked one of the men for Krannon.\nThe man looked him up and down coldly and spat on his shoes before\nanswering.\n\nKrannon worked in a large storage bay by himself. He was a stocky man in\npatched coveralls whose only expression was one of intense gloom. When\nJason came in he stopped hauling bales and sat down on the nearest one.\nThe lines of unhappiness were cut into his face and seemed to grow\ndeeper while Jason explained what he was after. All the talk of ancient\nhistory on Pyrrus bored him as well and he yawned openly. When Jason\nfinished he yawned again and didn't even bother to answer him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJason waited a moment, then asked again. \"I said do you have any old\nbooks, papers, records or that sort of thing?\"\n\n\"You sure picked the right guy to bother, off-worlder,\" was his only\nanswer. \"After talking to me you're going to have nothing but trouble.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\" Jason asked.\n\n\"Why?\" For the first time he was animated with something besides grief.\n\"I'll tell you why! I made one mistake, just one, and I get a life\nsentence. For life--how would you like that? Just me alone, being by\nmyself all the time. Even taking orders from the grubbers.\"\n\nJason controlled himself, keeping the elation out of his voice.\n\"Grubbers? What are grubbers?\"\n\nThe enormity of the question stopped Krannon, it seemed impossible that\nthere could be a man alive who had never heard of grubbers. Happiness\nlifted some of the gloom from his face as he realized that he had a\ncaptive audience who would listen to his troubles.\n\n\"Grubbers are traitors--that's what they are. Traitors to the human race\nand they ought to be wiped out. Living in the jungle. The things they do\nwith the animals--\"\n\n\"You mean they're people ... Pyrrans like yourself?\" Jason broke in.\n\n\"Not like _me_, mister. Don't make that mistake again if you want to go\non living. Maybe I dozed off on guard once so I got stuck with this job.\nThat doesn't mean I like it or like them. They stink, really stink, and\nif it wasn't for the food we get from them they'd all be dead tomorrow.\nThat's the kind of killing job I could really put my heart into.\"\n\n\"If they supply you with food, you must give them something in return?\"\n\n\"Trade goods, beads, knives, the usual things. Supply sends them over in\ncartons and I take care of the delivery.\"\n\n\"How?\" Jason asked.\n\n\"By armored truck to the delivery site. Then I go back later to pick up\nthe food they've left in exchange.\"\n\n\"Can I go with you on the next delivery?\"\n\nKrannon frowned over the idea for a minute. \"Yeah, I suppose it's all\nright if you're stupid enough to come. You can help me load. They're\nbetween harvests now, so the next trip won't be for eight days--\"\n\n\"But that's after the ship leaves--it'll be too late. Can't you go\nearlier?\"\n\n\"Don't tell me your troubles, mister,\" Krannon grumbled, climbing to his\nfeet. \"That's when I go and the date's not changing for you.\"\n\nJason realized he had got as much out of the man as was possible for one\nsession. He started for the door, then turned.\n\n\"One thing,\" he asked. \"Just what do these savages--the grubbers--look\nlike?\"\n\n\"How do I know,\" Krannon snapped. \"I trade with them, I don't make love\nto them. If I ever saw one, I'd shoot him down on the spot.\" He flexed\nhis fingers and his gun jumped in and out of his hand as he said it.\nJason quietly let himself out.\n\nLying on his bunk, resting his gravity-weary body, he searched for a way\nto get Krannon to change the delivery date. His millions of credits were\nworthless on this world without currency. If the man couldn't be\nconvinced, he had to be bribed. With what? Jason's eyes touched the\nlocker where his off-world clothing still hung, and he had an idea.\n\nIt was morning before he could return to the food warehouse--and one day\ncloser to his deadline. Krannon didn't bother to look up from his work\nwhen Jason came in.\n\n\"Do you want this?\" Jason asked, handing the outcast a flat gold case\ninset with a single large diamond. Krannon grunted and turned it over in\nhis hands.\n\n\"A toy,\" he said. \"What is it good for?\"\n\n\"Well, when you press this button you get a light.\" A flame appeared\nthrough a hole in the top. Krannon started to hand it back.\n\n\"What do I need a little fire for? Here, keep it.\"\n\n\"Wait a second,\" Jason said, \"that's not all it does. When you press the\njewel in the center one of these comes out.\" A black pellet the size of\nhis fingernail dropped into his palm. \"A grenade, made of solid\nulranite. Just squeeze it hard and throw. Three seconds later it\nexplodes with enough force to blast open this building.\"\n\nThis time Krannon almost smiled as he reached for the case. Destructive\nand death-dealing weapons are like candy to a Pyrran. While he looked at\nit Jason made his offer.\n\n\"The case and bombs are yours if you move the date of your next delivery\nup to tomorrow--and let me go with you.\"\n\n\"Be here at 0500,\" Krannon said. \"We leave early.\"\n\n\n\n\nXV.\n\n\nThe truck rumbled up to the perimeter gate and stopped. Krannon waved to\nthe guards through the front window, then closed a metal shield over it.\nWhen the gates swung open the truck--really a giant armored tank--ground\nslowly forward. There was a second gate beyond the first, that did not\nopen until the interior one was closed. Jason looked through the\nsecond-driver's periscope as the outer gate lifted. Automatic\nflame-throwers flared through the opening, cutting off only when the\ntruck reached them. A scorched area ringed the gate, beyond that the\njungle began. Unconsciously Jason shrank back in his seat.\n\nAll the plants and animals he had seen only specimens of, existed here\nin profusion. Thorn-ringed branches and vines laced themselves into a\nsolid mat, through which the wild life swarmed. A fury of sound hurled\nat them, thuds and scratchings rang on the armor. Krannon laughed and\nclosed the switch that electrified the outer grid. The scratchings died\naway as the beasts completed the circuit to the grounded hull.\n\nIt was slow-speed, low-gear work tearing through the jungle. Krannon had\nhis face buried in the periscope mask and silently fought the controls.\nWith each mile the going seemed to get better, until he finally swung up\nthe periscope and opened the window armor. The jungle was still thick\nand deadly, but nothing like the area immediately around the perimeter.\nIt appeared as if most of the lethal powers of Pyrrus were concentrated\nin the single area around the settlement. Why? Jason asked himself. Why\nthis intense and planetary hatred?\n\nThe motors died and Krannon stood up, stretching. \"We're here,\" he said.\n\"Let's unload.\"\n\nThere was bare rock around the truck, a rounded hillock that projected\nfrom the jungle, too smooth and steep for vegetation to get a hold.\nKrannon opened the cargo hatches and they pushed out the boxes and\ncrates. When they finished Jason slumped down, exhausted, onto the pile.\n\n\"Get back in, we're leaving,\" Krannon said.\n\n\"You are, I'm staying right here.\"\n\nKrannon looked at him coldly. \"Get in the truck or I'll kill you. No one\nstays out here. For one thing you couldn't live an hour alone. But worse\nthan that the grubbers would get you. Kill you at once, of course, but\nthat's not important. But you have equipment that we can't allow into\ntheir hands. You want to see a grubber with a gun?\"\n\nWhile the Pyrran talked, Jason's thoughts had rushed ahead. He hoped\nthat Krannon was as thick of head as he was fast of reflex.\n\nJason looked at the trees, let his gaze move up through the thick\nbranches. Though Krannon was still talking, he was automatically aware\nof Jason's attention. When Jason's eyes widened and his gun jumped into\nhis hand, Krannon's own gun appeared and he turned in the same\ndirection.\n\n\"There--in the top!\" Jason shouted, and fired into the tangle of\nbranches. Krannon fired, too. As soon as he did, Jason hurled himself\nbackwards, curled into a ball, rolling down the inclined rock. The shots\nhad covered the sounds of his movements, and before Krannon could turn\nback the gravity had dragged him down the rock into the thick foliage.\nCrashing branches slapped at him, but slowed his fall. When he stopped\nmoving he was lost in the tangle. Krannon's shots came too late to hit\nhim.\n\nLying there, tired and bruised, Jason heard the Pyrran cursing him out.\nHe stamped around on the rock, fired a few shots, but knew better than\nto enter the trees. Finally he gave up and went back to the truck. The\nmotor gunned into life and the treads clanked and scraped down the rock\nand back into the jungle. There were muted rumblings and crashes that\nslowly died away.\n\nThen Jason was alone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUp until that instant he hadn't realized quite how alone he would be.\nSurrounded by nothing but death, the truck already vanished from sight.\nHe had to force down an overwhelming desire to run after it. What was\ndone was done.\n\nThis was a long chance to take, but it was the only way to contact the\ngrubbers. They were savages, but still they had come from human stock.\nAnd they hadn't sunk so low as to stop the barter with the civilized\nPyrrans. He had to contact them, befriend them. Find out how they had\nmanaged to live safely on this madhouse world.\n\nIf there had been another way to lick the problem, he would have taken\nit; he didn't relish the role of martyred hero. But Kerk and his\ndeadline had forced his hand. The contact had to be made fast and this\nwas the only way.\n\nThere was no telling where the savages were, or how soon they would\narrive. If the woods weren't too lethal he could hide there, pick his\ntime to approach them. If they found him among the supplies, they might\nskewer him on the spot with a typical Pyrran reflex.\n\nWalking warily he approached the line of trees. Something moved on\na branch, but vanished as he came near. None of the plants near a\nthick-trunked tree looked poisonous, so he slipped behind it. There was\nnothing deadly in sight and it surprised him. He let his body relax a\nbit, leaning against the rough bark.\n\nSomething soft and choking fell over his head, his body was seized in a\nsteel grip. The more he struggled the tighter it held him until the\nblood thundered in his ears and his lungs screamed for air.\n\nOnly when he grew limp did the pressure let up. His first panic ebbed a\nlittle when he realized that it wasn't an animal that attacked him. He\nknew nothing about the grubbers, but they were human so he still had a\nchance.\n\nHis arms and legs were tied, the power holster ripped from his arm. He\nfelt strangely naked without it. The powerful hands grabbed him again\nand he was hurled into the air, to fall face down across something warm\nand soft. Fear pressed in again, it was a large animal of some kind. And\nall Pyrran animals were deadly.\n\nWhen the animal moved off, carrying him, panic was replaced by a feeling\nof mounting elation. The grubbers had managed to work out a truce of\nsome kind with at least one form of animal life. He had to find out how.\nIf he could get that secret--and get it back to the city--it would\njustify all his work and pain. It might even justify Welf's death if the\nage-old war could be slowed or stopped.\n\nJason's tightly bound limbs hurt terribly at first, but grew numb with\nthe circulation shut off. The jolting ride continued endlessly, he had\nno way of measuring the time. A rainfall soaked him, then he felt his\nclothes steaming as the sun came out.\n\nThe ride was finally over. He was pulled from the animal's back and\ndumped down. His arms dropped free as someone loosed the bindings. The\nreturning circulation soaked him in pain as he lay there, struggling to\nmove. When his hands finally obeyed him he lifted them to his face and\nstripped away the covering, a sack of thick fur. Light blinded him as he\nsucked in breath after breath of clean air.\n\nBlinking against the glare, he looked around. He was lying on a floor of\ncrude planking, the setting sun shining into his eyes through the\ndoorless entrance of the building. There was a ploughed field outside,\nstretching down the curve of hill to the edge of the jungle. It was too\ndark to see much inside the hut.\n\nSomething blocked the light of the doorway, a tall animallike figure.\nOn second look Jason realized it was a man with long hair and thick\nbeard. He was dressed in furs, even his legs were wrapped in fur\nleggings. His eyes were fixed on his captive, while one hand fondled an\nax that hung from his waist.\n\n\"Who're you? What y'want?\" the bearded man asked suddenly.\n\nJason picked his words slowly, wondering if this savage shared the same\nhair-trigger temper as the city dwellers.\n\n\"My name is Jason. I come in peace. I want to be your friend ...\"\n\n\"Lies!\" the man grunted, and pulled the ax from his belt. \"Junkman\ntricks. I saw y'hide. Wait to kill me. Kill you first.\" He tested the\nedge of the blade with a horny thumb, then raised it.\n\n\"Wait!\" Jason said desperately. \"You don't understand.\"\n\nThe ax swung down.\n\n\"I'm from off-world and--\"\n\nA solid thunk shook him as the ax buried itself in the wood next to his\nhead. At the last instant the man had twitched it aside. He grabbed the\nfront of Jason's clothes and pulled him up until their faces touched.\n\n\"S'true?\" he shouted. \"Y'from off-world?\" His hand opened and Jason\ndropped back before he could answer. The savage jumped over him, towards\nthe dim rear of the hut.\n\n\"Rhes must know of this,\" he said as he fumbled with something on the\nwall. Light sprang out.\n\nAll Jason could do was stare. The hairy, fur-covered savage was\noperating a communicator. The calloused, dirt-encrusted fingers deftly\nsnapped open the circuits, dialed a number.\n\n\n\n\nXVI.\n\n\nIt made no sense. Jason tried to reconcile the modern machine with the\nbarbarian and couldn't. Who was he calling? The existence of one\ncommunicator meant there was at least another. Was Rhes a person or a\nthing?\n\nWith a mental effort he grabbed hold of his thoughts and braked them to\na stop. There was something new here, factors he hadn't counted on. He\nkept reassuring himself there was an explanation for everything, once\nyou had your facts straight.\n\nJason closed his eyes, shutting out the glaring rays of the sun where it\ncut through the tree tops, and reconsidered his facts. They separated\nevenly into two classes; those he had observed for himself, and those he\nhad learned from the city dwellers. This last class of \"facts\" he would\nhold, to see if they fitted with what he learned. There was a good\nchance that most, or all, of them would prove false.\n\n\"Get up,\" the voice jarred into his thoughts. \"We're leaving.\"\n\nHis legs were still numb and hardly usable. The bearded man snorted in\ndisgust and hauled him to his feet, propping him against the outer wall.\nJason clutched the knobby bark of the logs when he was left alone. He\nlooked around, soaking up impressions.\n\nIt was the first time he had been on a farm since he had run away from\nhome. A different world with a different ecology, but the similarity was\napparent enough to him. A new-sown field stretched down the hill in\nfront of the shack. Ploughed by a good farmer. Even, well cast furrows\nthat followed the contour of the slope. Another, larger log building was\nnext to this one, probably a barn.\n\nThere was a snuffling sound behind him and Jason turned quickly--and\nfroze. His hand called for the missing gun and his finger tightened down\non a trigger that wasn't there.\n\nIt had come out of the jungle and padded up quietly behind him. It had\nsix thick legs with clawed feet that dug into the ground. The two-meter\nlong body was covered with matted yellow and black fur, all except the\nskull and shoulders. These were covered with overlapping horny plates.\nJason could see all this because the beast was that close.\n\nHe waited to die.\n\nThe mouth opened, a froglike division of the hairless skull, revealing\ndouble rows of jagged teeth.\n\n\"Here, Fido,\" the bearded man said, coming up behind Jason and snapping\nhis fingers at the same time. The thing bounded forward, brushing past\nthe dazed Jason, and rubbed his head against the man's leg. \"Nice\ndoggy,\" the man said, his fingers scratching under the edge of the\ncarapace where it joined the flesh.\n\nThe bearded man had brought two of the riding animals out of the barn,\nsaddled and bridled. Jason barely noticed the details of smooth skin and\nlong legs as he swung up on one. His feet were quickly lashed to the\nstirrups. When they started the skull-headed beast followed them.\n\n\"Nice doggy!\" Jason said, and for no reason started to laugh. The\nbearded man turned and scowled at him until he was quiet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy the time they entered the jungle it was dark. It was impossible to\nsee under the thick foliage, and they used no lights. The animals seemed\nto know the way. There were scraping noises and shrill calls from the\njungle around them, but it didn't bother Jason too much. Perhaps the\nautomatic manner in which the other man undertook the journey reassured\nhim. Or the presence of the \"dog\" that he felt rather than saw. The trip\nwas a long one, but not too uncomfortable.\n\nThe regular motion of the animal and his fatigue overcame Jason and he\ndozed into a fitful sleep, waking with a start each time he slumped\nforward. In the end he slept sitting up in the saddle. Hours passed this\nway, until he opened his eyes and saw a square of light before them. The\ntrip was over.\n\nHis legs were stiff and galled with saddle sores. After his feet were\nuntied getting down was an effort, and he almost fell. A door opened\nand Jason went in. It took his eyes some moments to get used to the\nlight, until he could make out the form of a man on the bed before him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Come over here and sit down.\" The voice was full and strong, accustomed\nto command. The body was that of an invalid. A blanket covered him to\nthe waist, above that the flesh was sickly white, spotted with red\nnodules, and hung loosely over the bones. There seemed to be nothing\nleft of the man except skin and skeleton.\n\n\"Not very nice,\" the man on the bed said, \"but I've grown used to it.\"\nHis tone changed abruptly. \"Naxa said you were from off-world. Is that\ntrue?\"\n\nJason nodded yes, and his answer stirred the living skeleton to life.\nThe head lifted from the pillow and the red-rimmed eyes sought his with\na desperate intensity.\n\n\"My name is Rhes and I'm a ... grubber. Will you help me?\"\n\nJason wondered at the intensity of Rhes' question, all out of proportion\nto the simple content of its meaning. Yet he could see no reason to give\nanything other than the first and obvious answer that sprang to his\nlips.\n\n\"Of course I'll help you, in whatever way I can. As long as it involves\nno injury to anyone else. What do you want?\"\n\nThe sick man's head had fallen back limply, exhausted, as Jason talked.\nBut the fire still burned in the eyes.\n\n\"Feel assured ... I want to injure no others,\" Rhes said. \"Quite the\nopposite. As you see I am suffering from a disease that our remedies\nwill not stop. Within a few more days I will be dead. Now I have\nseen ... the city people ... using a device, they press it over a\nwound or an animal bite. Do you have one of these machines?\"\n\n\"That sounds like a description of the medikit.\" Jason touched the\nbutton at his waist that dropped the medikit into his hand. \"I have mine\nhere. It analyzes and treats most ...\"\n\n\"Would you use it on me?\" Rhes broke in, his voice suddenly urgent.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Jason said. \"I should have realized.\" He stepped forward\nand pressed the machine over one of the inflamed areas on Rhes' chest.\nThe operation light came on and the thin shaft of the analyzer probe\nslid down. When it withdrew the device hummed, then clicked three times\nas three separate hypodermic needles lanced into the skin. Then the\nlight went out.\n\n\"Is that all?\" Rhes asked, as he watched Jason stow the medikit back in\nhis belt.\n\nJason nodded, then looked up and noticed the wet marks of tears on the\nsick man's face. Rhes became aware at the same time and brushed at them\nangrily.\n\n\"When a man is sick,\" he growled, \"the body and all its senses become\ntraitor. I don't think I have cried since I was a child--but you must\nrealize it's not myself I'm crying for. It's the untold thousands of my\npeople who have died for lack of that little device you treat so\ncasually.\"\n\n\"Surely you have medicines, doctors of your own?\"\n\n\"Herb doctors and witch doctors,\" Rhes said, consigning them all to\noblivion with a chop of his hand. \"The few hard-working and honest men\nare hampered by the fact that the faith healers can usually cure better\nthan their strongest potion.\"\n\nThe talking had tired Rhes. He stopped suddenly and closed his eyes. On\nhis chest, the inflamed areas were already losing their angry color as\nthe injections took affect. Jason glanced around the room, looking for\nclues to the mystery of these people.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFloor and walls were made of wood lengths fitted together, free of paint\nor decoration. They looked simple and crude, fit only for the savages\nhe had expected to meet. Or were they crude? The wood had a sweeping,\nflamelike grain. When he bent close he saw that wax had been rubbed over\nthe wood to bring out this pattern. Was this the act of savages--or of\nartistic men seeking to make the most of simple materials? The final\neffect was far superior to the drab paint and riveted steel rooms of the\ncity-dwelling Pyrrans. Wasn't it true that both ends of the artistic\nscale were dominated by simplicity? The untutored aborigine made a\nsimple expression of a clear idea, and created beauty. At the other\nextreme, the sophisticated critic rejected over-elaboration and\ndecoration and sought the truthful clarity of uncluttered art. At which\nend of the scale was he looking now?\n\nThese men were savages, he had been told that. They dressed in furs and\nspoke a slurred and broken language, at least Naxa did. Rhes admitted he\npreferred faith healers to doctors. But, if all this were true, where\ndid the communicator fit into the picture? Or the glowing ceiling that\nilluminated the room with a soft light?\n\nRhes opened his eyes and stared at Jason, as if seeing him for the first\ntime. \"Who are you?\" he asked. \"And what are you doing here?\"\n\nThere was a cold menace in his words and Jason understood why. The city\nPyrrans hated the \"grubbers\" and, without a doubt, the feeling was\nmutual. Naxa's ax had proved that. Naxa had entered silently while they\ntalked, and stood with his fingers touching the haft of this same ax.\nJason knew his life was still in jeopardy, until he gave an answer that\nsatisfied these men.\n\nHe couldn't tell the truth. If they once suspected he was spying among\nthem to aid the city people, it would be the end. Nevertheless, he had\nto be free to talk about the survival problem.\n\nThe answer hit him as soon as he had stated the problem. All this had\nonly taken an instant to consider, as he turned back to face the\ninvalid, and he answered at once. Trying to keep his voice normal and\nunconcerned.\n\n\"I'm Jason dinAlt, an ecologist, so you see I have the best reasons in\nthe universe for visiting this planet--\"\n\n\"What is an ecologist?\" Rhes broke in. There was nothing in his voice to\nindicate whether he meant the question seriously, or as a trap. All\ntraces of the ease of their earlier conversation were gone, his voice\nhad the deadliness of a stingwing's poison. Jason chose his words\ncarefully.\n\n\"Simply stated, it is that branch of biology that considers the\nrelations between organisms and their environment. How climatic and\nother factors affect the life forms, and how the life forms in turn\naffect each other and the environment.\" That much Jason knew was\ntrue--but he really knew very little more about the subject so he moved\non quickly.\n\n\"I heard reports of this planet, and finally came here to study it\nfirsthand. I did what work I could in the shelter of the city, but it\nwasn't enough. The people there think I'm crazy, but they finally agreed\nto let me make a trip out here.\"\n\n\"What arrangements have been made for your return?\" Naxa snapped.\n\n\"None,\" Jason told him. \"They seemed quite sure that I would be killed\ninstantly and had no hope of me coming back. In fact, they refused to\nlet me go and I had to break away.\"\n\nThis answer seemed to satisfy Rhes and his face cracked into a mirthless\nsmile. \"They would think that, those junkmen. Can't move a meter outside\ntheir own walls without an armor-plated machine as big as a barn. What\ndid they tell you about us?\"\n\nAgain Jason knew a lot depended on his answer. This time he thought\ncarefully before speaking.\n\n\"Well ... perhaps I'll get that ax in the back of my neck for saying\nthis ... but I have to be honest. You must know what they think. They\ntold me you were filthy and ignorant savages who smelled. And you ...\nwell, had curious customs you practiced with the animals. In exchange\nfor food, they traded you beads and knives ...\"\n\nBoth Pyrrans broke into a convulsion of laughter at this. Rhes stopped\nsoon, from weakness, but Naxa laughed himself into a coughing fit and\nhad to splash water over his head from a gourd jug.\n\n\"That I believe well enough,\" Rhes said, \"it sounds like the stupidity\nthey would talk. Those people know nothing of the world they live in. I\nhope the rest of what you said is true, but even if it is not, you are\nwelcome here. You are from off-world, that I know. No junkman would have\nlifted a finger to save my life. You are the first off-worlder my people\nhave ever known and for that you are doubly welcome. We will help you in\nany way we can. My arm is your arm.\"\n\nThese last words had a ritual sound to them, and when Jason repeated\nthem, Naxa nodded at the correctness of this. At the same time, Jason\nfelt that they were more than empty ritual. Interdependence meant\nsurvival on Pyrrus, and he knew that these people stood together to the\ndeath against the mortal dangers around them. He hoped the ritual would\ninclude him in that protective sphere.\n\n\"That is enough for tonight,\" Rhes said. \"The spotted sickness had\nweakened me, and your medicine has turned me to jelly. You will stay\nhere, Jason. There is a blanket, but no bed at least for now.\"\n\nEnthusiasm had carried Jason this far, making him forget the two-gee\nexertions of the long day. Now fatigue hit him a physical blow. He had\ndim memories of refusing food and rolling in the blanket on the floor.\nAfter that, oblivion.\n\n\n\n\nXVII.\n\n\nEvery square inch of his body ached where the doubled gravity had\npressed his flesh to the unyielding wood of the floor. His eyes were\ngummy and his mouth was filled with an indescribable taste that came off\nin chunks. Sitting up was an effort and he had to stifle a groan as his\njoints cracked.\n\n\"Good day, Jason,\" Rhes called from the bed. \"If I didn't believe in\nmedicine so strongly, I would be tempted to say there is a miracle in\nyour machine that has cured me overnight.\"\n\nThere was no doubt that he was on the mend. The inflamed patches had\nvanished and the burning light was gone from his eyes. He sat, propped\nup on the bed, watching the morning sun melt the night's hailstorm into\nthe fields.\n\n\"There's meat in the cabinet there,\" he said, \"and either water or visk\nto drink.\"\n\nThe visk proved to be a distilled beverage of extraordinary potency that\ninstantly cleared the fog from Jason's brain, though it did leave a\nslight ringing in his ears. And the meat was a tenderly smoked joint,\nthe best food he had tasted since leaving Darkhan. Taken together they\nrestored his faith in life and the future. He lowered his glass with a\nrelaxed sigh and looked around.\n\nWith the pressures of immediate survival and exhaustion removed, his\nthoughts returned automatically to his problem. What were these people\nreally like--and how had they managed to survive in the deadly\nwilderness? In the city he had been told they were savages. Yet there\nwas a carefully tended and repaired communicator on the wall. And by the\ndoor a crossbow--that fired machined metal bolts, he could see the tool\nmarks still visible on their shanks. The one thing he needed was more\ninformation. He could start by getting rid of some of his\nmisinformation.\n\n\"Rhes, you laughed when I told you what the city people said, about\ntrading you trinkets for food. What do they really trade you?\"\n\n\"Anything within certain limits,\" Rhes said. \"Small manufactured items,\nsuch as electronic components for our communicators. Rustless alloys we\ncan't make in our forges, cutting tools, atomic electric converters that\nproduce power from any radioactive element. Things like that. Within\nreason they'll trade anything we ask that isn't on the forbidden list.\nThey need the food badly.\"\n\n\"And the items on the forbidden list--?\"\n\n\"Weapons, of course, or anything that might be made into a powerful\nweapon. They know we make gunpowder so we can't get anything like large\ncastings or seamless tubing we could make into heavy gun barrels. We\ndrill our own rifle barrels by hand, though the crossbow is quiet and\nfaster in the jungle. Then they don't like us to know very much, so the\nonly reading matter that gets to us are tech maintenance manuals, empty\nof basic theory.\n\n\"The last banned category you know about--medicine. This is the one\nthing I cannot understand, that makes me burn with hatred with every\ndeath they might have prevented.\"\n\n\"I know their reasons,\" Jason said.\n\n\"Then tell me, because I can think of none.\"\n\n\"Survival--it's just that simple. I doubt if you realize it, but they\nhave a decreasing population. It is just a matter of years before they\nwill be gone. Whereas your people at least must have a stable--if not\nslightly growing population--to have existed without their mechanical\nprotections. So in the city they hate you and are jealous of you at the\nsame time. If they gave you medicine and you prospered, you would be\nwinning the battle they have lost. I imagine they tolerate you as a\nnecessary evil, to supply them with food, otherwise they wish you were\nall dead.\"\n\n\"It makes sense,\" Rhes growled, slamming his fist against the bed. \"The\nkind of twisted logic you expect from junkmen. They use us to feed them,\ngive us the absolute minimum in return, and at the same time cut us off\nfrom the knowledge that will get us out of this hand to mouth existence.\nWorse, far worse, they cut us off from the stars and the rest of\nmankind.\" The hatred on his face was so strong that Jason unconsciously\ndrew back.\n\n\"Do you think we are savages here, Jason? We act and look like animals\nbecause we have to fight for existence on an animal level. Yet we know\nabout the stars. In that chest over there, sealed in metal, are over\nthirty books, all we have. Fiction most of them, with some history and\ngeneral science thrown in. Enough to keep alive the stories of the\nsettlement here and the rest of the universe outside. We see the ships\nland in the city and we know that up there are worlds we can only dream\nabout and never see. Do you wonder that we hate these beasts that call\nthemselves men, and would destroy them in an instant if we could? They\nare right to keep weapons from us--for sure as the sun rises in the\nmorning we would kill them to a man if we were able, and take over the\nthings they have withheld from us.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a harsh condemnation, but essentially a truthful one. At least\nfrom the point of view of the outsiders. Jason didn't try to explain to\nthe angry man that the city Pyrrans looked on their attitude as being\nthe only possible and logical one. \"How did this battle between your two\ngroups ever come about?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Rhes said, \"I've thought about it many times, but there\nare no records of that period. We do know that we are all descended from\ncolonists who arrived at the same time. Somewhere, at some time, the two\ngroups separated. Perhaps it was a war, I've read about them in the\nbooks. I have a partial theory, though I can't prove it, that it was the\nlocation of the city.\"\n\n\"Location--I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Well, you know the junkmen, and you've seen where their city is. They\nmanaged to put it right in the middle of the most savage spot on this\nplanet. You know they don't care about any living thing except\nthemselves, shoot and kill is their only logic. So they wouldn't\nconsider where to build their city, and managed to build it in the\nstupidest spot imaginable. I'm sure my ancestors saw how foolish this\nwas and tried to tell them so. That would be reason enough for a war,\nwouldn't it?\"\n\n\"It might have been--if that's really what happened,\" Jason said. \"But I\nthink you have the problem turned backwards. It's a war between native\nPyrran life and humans, each fighting to destroy the other. The life\nforms change continually, seeking that final destruction of the\ninvader.\"\n\n\"Your theory is even wilder than mine,\" Rhes said. \"That's not true at\nall. I admit that life isn't too easy on this planet ... if what I have\nread in the books about other planets is true ... but it doesn't change.\nYou have to be fast on your feet and keep your eyes open for anything\nbigger than you, but you can survive. Anyway, it doesn't really matter\nwhy. The junkmen always look for trouble and I'm happy to see that they\nhave enough.\"\n\nJason didn't try to press the point. The effort of forcing Rhes to\nchange his basic attitudes wasn't worth it--even if possible. He hadn't\nsucceeded in convincing anyone in the city of the lethal mutations even\nwhen they could observe all the facts. Rhes could still supply\ninformation though.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I suppose it's not important who started the battle,\" Jason said for\nthe other man's benefit, not meaning a word of it, \"but you'll have to\nagree that the city people are permanently at war with all the local\nlife. Your people, though, have managed to befriend at least two species\nthat I have seen. Do you have any idea how this was done?\"\n\n\"Naxa will be here in a minute,\" Rhes said, pointing to the door, \"as\nsoon as he's taken care of the animals. Ask him. He's the best talker we\nhave.\"\n\n\"Talker?\" Jason asked. \"I had the opposite idea about him. He didn't\ntalk much, and what he did say was, well ... a little hard to understand\nat times.\"\n\n\"Not that kind of talking.\" Rhes broke in impatiently. \"The talkers look\nafter the animals. They train the dogs and doryms, and the better ones\nlike Naxa are always trying to work with other beasts. They dress\ncrudely, but they have to. I've heard them say that the animals don't\nlike chemicals, metal or tanned leather, so they wear untanned furs for\nthe most part. But don't let the dirt fool you, it has nothing to do\nwith his intelligence.\"\n\n\"Doryms? Are those your carrying beasts--the kind we rode coming here?\"\n\nRhes nodded. \"Doryms are more than pack animals, they're really a little\nbit of everything. The large males pull the ploughs and other machines,\nwhile the younger animals are used for meat. If you want to know more,\nask Naxa, you'll find him in the barn.\"\n\n\"I'd like to do that,\" Jason said, standing up. \"Only I feel undressed\nwithout my gun--\"\n\n\"Take it, by all means, it's in that chest by the door. Only watch out\nwhat you shoot around here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNaxa was in the rear of the barn, filing down one of the spadelike\ntoenails of a dorym. It was a strange scene. The fur-dressed man with\nthe great beast--and the contrast of a beryllium-copper file and\nelectroluminescent plates lighting the work.\n\nThe dorym opened its nostrils and pulled away when Jason entered; Naxa\npatted its neck and talked softly until it quieted and stood still,\nshivering slightly.\n\nSomething stirred in Jason's mind, with the feeling of a long unused\nmuscle being stressed. A hauntingly familiar sensation.\n\n\"Good morning,\" Jason said. Naxa grunted something and went back to his\nfiling. Watching him for a few minutes, Jason tried to analyze this new\nfeeling. It itched and slipped aside when he reached for it, escaping\nhim. Whatever it was, it had started when Naxa had talked to the dorym.\n\n\"Could you call one of the dogs in here, Naxa? I'd like to see one\ncloser up.\"\n\nWithout raising his head from his work, Naxa gave a low whistle. Jason\nwas sure it couldn't have been heard outside of the barn. Yet within a\nminute one of the Pyrran dogs slipped quietly in. The talker rubbed the\nbeast's head, mumbling to it, while the animal looked intently into his\neyes.\n\nThe dog became restless when Naxa turned back to work on the dorym. It\nprowled around the barn, sniffing, then moved quickly towards the open\ndoor. Jason called it back.\n\nAt least he meant to call it. At the last moment he said nothing.\nNothing aloud. On sudden impulse he kept his mouth closed--only he\ncalled the dog with his mind. Thinking the words _come here_, directing\nthe impulse at the animal with all the force and direction he had ever\nused to manipulate dice. As he did it he realized it had been a long\ntime since he had even considered using his psi powers.\n\nThe dog stopped and turned back towards him.\n\nIt hesitated, looking at Naxa, then walked over to Jason.\n\nSeen this closely the beast was a nightmare hound. The hairless\nprotective plates, tiny red-rimmed eyes, and countless, saliva-dripping\nteeth did little to inspire confidence. Yet Jason felt no fear. There\nwas a rapport between man and animal that was understood. Without\nconscious thought he reached out and scratched the dog along the back,\nwhere he knew it itched.\n\n\"Didn't know y're a talker,\" Naxa said. As he watched them, there was\nfriendship in his voice for the first time.\n\n\"I didn't know either--until just now,\" Jason said. He looked into the\neyes of the animal before him, scratched the ridged and ugly back, and\nbegan to understand.\n\nThe talkers must have well developed psi facilities, that was obvious\nnow. There is no barrier of race or alien form when two creatures share\neach other's emotions. Empathy first, so there would be no hatred or\nfear. After that direct communication. The talkers might have been the\nones who first broke through the barrier of hatred on Pyrrus and learned\nto live with the native life. Others could have followed their\nexample--this might explain how the community of \"grubbers\" had been\nformed.\n\nNow that he was concentrating on it, Jason was aware of the soft flow\nof thoughts around him. The consciousness of the dorym was matched by\nother like patterns from the rear of the barn. He knew without going\noutside that more of the big beasts were in the field back there.\n\n\"This is all new to me,\" Jason said. \"Have you ever thought about it,\nNaxa? What does it feel like to be a talker? I mean, do you _know_ why\nit is you can get the animals to obey you while other people have no\nluck at all?\"\n\nThinking of this sort troubled Naxa. He ran his fingers through his\nthick hair and scowled as he answered. \"Nev'r thought about it. Just do\nit. Just get t'know the beast real good, then y'can guess what they're\ngoing t'do. That's all.\"\n\nIt was obvious that Naxa had never thought about the origin of his\nability to control the animals. And if he hadn't--probably no one else\nhad. They had no reason to. They simply accepted the powers of talkers\nas one of the facts of life.\n\nIdeas slipped towards each other in his mind, like the pieces of a\npuzzle joining together. He had told Kerk that the native life of Pyrrus\nhad joined in battle against mankind, he didn't know why. Well--he still\ndidn't know why, but he was getting an idea of the \"how.\"\n\n\"About how far are we from the city?\" Jason asked. \"Do you have an idea\nhow long it would take us to get there by dorym?\"\n\n\"Half a day there--half back. Why? Y'want to go?\"\n\n\"I don't want to get into the city, not yet. But I would like to get\nclose to it,\" Jason told him.\n\n\"See what Rhes say,\" was Naxa's answer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRhes granted instant permission without asking any questions. They\nsaddled up and left at once, in order to complete the round trip before\ndark.\n\nThey had been traveling less than an hour before Jason knew they were\ngoing in the direction of the city. With each minute the feeling grew\nstronger. Naxa was aware of it too, stirring in the saddle with unvoiced\nfeelings. They had to keep touching and reassuring their mounts which\nwere growing skittish and restless.\n\n\"This is far enough,\" Jason said. Naxa gratefully pulled to a stop.\n\nThe wordless thought beat through Jason's mind, filling it. He could\nfeel it on all sides--only much stronger ahead of them in the direction\nof the unseen city. Naxa and the doryms reacted in the same way,\nrestlessly uncomfortable, not knowing the cause.\n\nOne thing was obvious now. The Pyrran animals were sensitive to psi\nradiation--probably the plants and lower life forms as well. Perhaps\nthey communicated by it, since they obeyed the men who had a strong\ncontrol of it. And in this area was a wash of psi radiation such as he\nhad never experienced before. Though his personal talents specialized in\npsychokinesis--the mental control of inanimate matter--he was still\nsensitive to most mental phenomena. Watching a sports event he had many\ntimes felt the unanimous accord of many minds expressing the same\nthought. What he felt now was like that.\n\nOnly terribly different. A crowd exulted at some success on the field,\nor groaned at a failure. The feeling fluxed and changed as the game\nprogressed. Here the wash of thought was unending, strong and\nfrightening. It didn't translate into words very well. It was part\nhatred, part fear--and all destruction.\n\n\"_KILL THE ENEMY_\" was as close as Jason could express it. But it was\nmore than that. An unending river of mental outrage and death.\n\n\"Let's go back now,\" he said, suddenly battered and sickened by the\nfeelings he had let wash through him. As they started the return trip he\nbegan to understand many things.\n\nHis sudden unspeakable fear when the Pyrran animal had attacked him that\nfirst day on the planet. And his recurrent nightmares that had never\ncompletely ceased, even with drugs. Both of these were his reaction to\nthe hatred directed at the city. Though for some reason he hadn't felt\nit directly up to now, enough had reached through to him to get a strong\nemotional reaction.\n\nRhes was asleep when they got back and Jason couldn't talk to him until\nmorning. In spite of his fatigue from the trip, he stayed awake late\ninto the night, going over in his mind the discoveries of the day. Could\nhe tell Rhes what he had found out? Not very well. If he did that, he\nwould have to explain the importance of his discovery and what he meant\nto use it for. Nothing that aided the city dwellers would appeal to Rhes\nin the slightest. Best to say nothing until the entire affair was over.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII.\n\n\nAfter breakfast he told Rhes that he wanted to return to the city.\n\n\"Then you have seen enough of our barbarian world, and wish to go back\nto your friends. To help them wipe us out perhaps?\" Rhes said it\nlightly, but there was a touch of cold malice behind his words.\n\n\"I hope you don't really think that,\" Jason told him. \"You must realize\nthat the opposite is true. I would like to see this civil war ended and\nyour people getting all the benefits of science and medicine that have\nbeen withheld. I'll do everything I can to bring that about.\"\n\n\"They'll never change,\" Rhes said gloomily, \"so don't waste your time.\nBut there is one thing you must do, for your protection and ours. Don't\nadmit, or even hint, that you've talked to any grubbers!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Why not! Suffering death are you that simple! They will do anything to\nsee that we don't rise too high, and would much prefer to see us all\ndead. Do you think they would hesitate to kill you if they as much as\nsuspected you had contacted us? They realize--even if you don't--that\nyou can singlehandedly alter the entire pattern of power on this planet.\nThe ordinary junkman may think of us as being only one step above the\nanimals, but the leaders don't. They know what we need and what we want.\nThey could probably guess just what it is I am going to ask you.\n\n\"Help us, Jason dinAlt. Get back among those human pigs and lie. Say you\nnever talked to us, that you hid in the forest and we attacked you and\nyou had to shoot to save yourself. We'll supply some recent corpses to\nmake that part of your story sound good. Make them believe you, and even\nafter you think you have them convinced keep on acting the part because\nthey will be watching you. Then tell them you have finished your work\nand are ready to leave. Get safely off Pyrrus, to another planet, and I\npromise you anything in the universe. Whatever you want you shall have.\nPower, money--_anything_.\n\n\"This is a rich planet. The junkmen mine and sell the metal, but we\ncould do it much better. Bring a spaceship back here and land anywhere\non this continent. We have no cities, but our people have farms\neverywhere, they will find you. We will then have commerce, trade--on\nour own. This is what we all want and we will work hard for it. And\n_you_ will have done it. Whatever you want we will give. That is a\npromise and we do not break our promises.\"\n\nThe intensity and magnitude of what he described rocked Jason. He knew\nthat Rhes spoke the truth and the entire resources of the planet would\nbe his, if he did as asked. For one second he was tempted, savoring the\nthought of what it would be like. Then came realization that it would be\na half answer, and a poor one at that. If these people had the strength\nthey wanted, their first act would be the attempted destruction of the\ncity men. The result would be bloody civil war that would probably\ndestroy them both. Rhes' answer was a good one--but only half an answer.\n\nJason had to find a better solution. One that would stop _all_ the\nfighting on this planet and allow the two groups of humans to live in\npeace.\n\n\"I will do nothing to injure your people, Rhes--and everything in my\npower to aid them,\" Jason said.\n\nThis half answer satisfied Rhes, who could see only one interpretation\nof it. He spent the rest of the morning on the communicator, arranging\nfor the food supplies that were being brought to the trading site.\n\n\"The supplies are ready and we have sent the signal,\" he said. \"The\ntruck will be there tomorrow and you will be waiting for it. Everything\nis arranged as I told you. You'll leave now with Naxa. You must reach\nthe meeting spot before the trucks.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIX.\n\n\n\"Trucks almost here. Y'know what to do?\" Naxa asked.\n\nJason nodded, and looked again at the dead man. Some beast had torn his\narm off and he had bled to death. The severed arm had been tied into the\nshirt sleeve, so from a distance it looked normal. Seen close up this\nlimp arm, plus the white skin and shocked expression on the face, gave\nJason an unhappy sensation. He liked to see his corpses safely buried.\nHowever he could understand its importance today.\n\n\"Here they're. Wait until his back's turned,\" Naxa whispered.\n\nThe armored truck had three powered trailers in tow this time. The train\nground up the rock slope and whined to a stop. Krannon climbed out of\nthe cab and looked carefully around before opening up the trailers. He\nhad a lift robot along to help him with the loading.\n\n\"Now!\" Naxa hissed.\n\nJason burst into the clearing, running, shouting Krannon's name. There\nwas a crackling behind him as two of the hidden men hurled the corpse\nthrough the foliage after him. He turned and fired without stopping,\nsetting the thing afire in midair.\n\nThere was the crack of another gun as Krannon fired, his shot jarred the\ntwice-dead corpse before it hit the ground. Then he was lying prone,\nfiring into the trees behind the running Jason.\n\nJust as Jason reached the truck there was a whirring in the air and hot\npain ripped into his back, throwing him to the ground. He looked around\nas Krannon dragged him through the door, and saw the metal shaft of a\ncrossbow bolt sticking out of his shoulder.\n\n\"Lucky,\" the Pyrran said. \"An inch lower would have got your heart. I\nwarned you about those grubbers. You're lucky to get off with only\nthis.\" He lay next to the door and snapped shots into the now quiet\nwood.\n\nTaking out the bolt hurt much more than it had going in. Jason cursed\nthe pain as Krannon put on a dressing, and admired the singleness of\npurpose of the people who had shot him. They had risked his life to make\nhis escape look real. And also risked the chance that he might turn\nagainst them after being shot. They did a job completely and thoroughly\nand he cursed them for their efficiency.\n\nKrannon climbed warily out of the truck, after Jason was bandaged.\nFinishing the loading quickly, he started the train of trailers back\ntowards the city. Jason had an anti-pain shot and dozed off as soon as\nthey started.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile he slept, Krannon must have radioed ahead, because Kerk was\nwaiting when they arrived. As soon as the truck entered the perimeter he\nthrew open the door and dragged Jason out. The bandage pulled and Jason\nfelt the wound tear open. He ground his teeth together; Kerk would not\nhave the satisfaction of hearing him cry out.\n\n\"I told you to stay in the buildings until the ship left. Why did you\nleave? Why did you go outside? You talked to the grubbers--didn't you?\"\nWith each question he shook Jason again.\n\n\"I didn't talk to--anyone.\" Jason managed to get the words out. \"They\ntried to take me, I shot two--hid out until the trucks came back.\"\n\n\"Got another one then,\" Krannon said. \"I saw it. Good shooting. Think I\ngot some, too. Let him go Kerk, they shot him in the back before he\ncould reach the truck.\"\n\n_That's enough explanations_, Jason thought to himself. _Don't overdo\nit. Let him make up his mind later. Now's the time to change the\nsubject. There's one thing that will get his mind off the grubbers._\n\n\"I've been fighting your war for you Kerk, while you stayed safely\ninside the perimeter.\" Jason leaned back against the side of the truck\nas the other loosened his grip. \"I've found out what your battle with\nthis planet is really about--and how you can win it. Now let me sit down\nand I'll tell you.\"\n\nMore Pyrrans had come up while they talked. None of them moved now. Like\nKerk, they stood frozen, looking at Jason. When Kerk talked, he spoke\nfor all of them.\n\n\"_What do you mean?_\"\n\n\"Just what I said. Pyrrus is fighting you--actively and consciously. Get\nfar enough out from this city and you can feel the waves of hatred that\nare directed at it. No, that's wrong--you can't because you've grown up\nwith it. But I can, and so could anyone else with any sort of psi\nsensitivity. There is a message of war being beamed against you\nconstantly. The life forms of this planet are psi-sensitive, and respond\nto that order. They attack and change and mutate for your destruction.\nAnd they'll keep on doing so until you are all dead. Unless you can stop\nthe war.\"\n\n\"How?\" Kerk snapped the word and every face echoed the question.\n\n\"By finding whoever or whatever is sending that message. The life forms\nthat attack you have no reasoning intelligence. They are being ordered\nto do so. I think I know how to find the source of these orders. After\nthat it will be a matter of getting across a message, asking for a truce\nand an eventual end to all hostilities.\"\n\nA dead silence followed his words as the Pyrrans tried to comprehend the\nideas. Kerk moved first, waving them all away.\n\n\"Go back to your work. This is my responsibility and I'll take care of\nit. As soon as I find out what truth there is here--if any--I'll make a\ncomplete report.\" The people drifted away silently, looking back as they\nwent.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nXX.\n\n\n\"From the beginning now,\" Kerk said. \"And leave out nothing.\"\n\n\"There is very little more that I can add to the physical facts. I saw\nthe animals, understood the message. I even experimented with some of\nthem and they reacted to my mental commands. What I must do now is track\ndown the source of the orders that keep this war going.\n\n\"I'll tell you something that I have never told anyone else. I'm not\nonly lucky at gambling. I have enough psi ability to alter probability\nin my favor. It's an erratic ability that I have tried to improve for\nobvious reasons. During the past ten years I managed to study at all of\nthe centers that do psi research. Compared to other fields of knowledge\nit is amazing how little they know. Basic psi talents can be improved by\npractice, and some machines have been devised that act as psionic\namplifiers. One of these, used correctly, is a very good directional\nindicator.\"\n\n\"You want to build this machine?\" Kerk asked.\n\n\"Exactly. Build it and take it outside the city in the ship. Any signal\nstrong enough to keep this centuries-old battle going should be strong\nenough to track down. I'll follow it, contact the creatures who are\nsending it, and try to find out why they are doing it. I assume you'll\ngo along with any reasonable plan that will end this war?\"\n\n\"Anything reasonable,\" Kerk said coldly. \"How long will it take you to\nbuild this machine?\"\n\n\"Just a few days if you have all the parts here,\" Jason told him.\n\n\"Then do it. I'm canceling the flight that's leaving now and I'll keep\nthe ship here, ready to go. When the machine is built I want you to\ntrack the signal and report back to me.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Jason said, standing up. \"As soon as I have this hole in my\nback looked at I'll draw up a list of things needed.\"\n\nA grim, unsmiling man named Skop was assigned to Jason as a combination\nguide and guard. He took his job very seriously, and it didn't take\nJason long to realize that he was a prisoner-at-large. Kerk had accepted\nhis story, but that was no guarantee that he believed it. At a single\nword from him, the guard could turn executioner.\n\nThe chill thought hit Jason that undoubtedly this was what would happen.\nWhether Kerk accepted the story or not--he couldn't afford to take a\nchance. As long as there was the slightest possibility Jason had\ncontacted the grubbers, he could not be allowed to leave the planet\nalive. The woods people were being simple if they thought a plan this\nobvious might succeed. Or had they just gambled on the very long chance\nit might work? _They_ certainly had nothing to lose by it.\n\nOnly half of Jason's mind was occupied with the work as he drew up a\nlist of materials he would need for the psionic direction finder. His\nthoughts plodded in tight circles, searching for a way out that didn't\nexist. He was too deeply involved now to just leave. Kerk would see to\nthat. Unless he could find a way to end the war and settle the grubber\nquestion he was marooned on Pyrrus for life. A very short life.\n\nWhen the list was ready he called Supply. With a few substitutions,\neverything he might possibly need was in stock, and would be sent over.\nSkop sank into an apparent doze in his chair and Jason, his head propped\nagainst the pull of gravity by one arm, began a working sketch of his\nmachine.\n\nJason looked up suddenly, aware of the silence. He could hear machinery\nin the building and voices in the hall outside. What kind of silence\nthen--?\n\nMental silence. He had been so preoccupied since his return to the city\nthat he hadn't noticed the complete lack of any kind of psi sensation.\nThe constant wash of animal reactions was missing, as was the vague\ntactile awareness of his PK. With sudden realization he remembered that\nit was always this way inside the city.\n\nHe tried to listen with his mind--and stopped almost before he began.\nThere was a constant press of thought about him that he was made aware\nof when he reached out. It was like being in a vessel far beneath the\nocean, with your hand on the door that held back the frightening\npressure. Touching the door, without opening it, you could feel the\nstresses, the power pushing in and waiting to crush you. It was this way\nwith the psi pressure on the city. The unvoiced hate-filled screams of\nPyrrus would instantly destroy any mind that received them. Some\nfunction of his brain acted as a psi-circuit breaker, shutting off\nawareness before his mind could be blasted. There was just enough\nleak-through to keep him aware of the pressure--and supply the raw\nmaterials for his constant nightmares.\n\nThere was only one fringe benefit. The lack of thought pressure made it\neasier for him to concentrate. In spite of his fatigue the diagram\ndeveloped swiftly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeta arrived late that afternoon, bringing the parts he had ordered. She\nslid the long box onto the workbench, started to speak, but changed her\nmind and said nothing. Jason looked up at her and smiled.\n\n\"Confused?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" she said, \"I'm not confused. Just annoyed.\nThe regular trip has been canceled and our supply schedule will be\nthrown off for months to come. And instead of piloting or perimeter\nassignment all I can do is stand around and wait for you. Then take\nsome silly flight following your directions. Do you wonder that I'm\nannoyed?\"\n\nJason carefully set the parts out on the chassis before he spoke. \"As I\nsaid, you're confused. I can point out how you're confused--which will\nmake you even more confused. A temptation that I frankly find hard to\nresist.\"\n\nShe looked across the bench at him, frowning. One finger unconsciously\ncurling and uncurling a short lock of hair. Jason liked her this way. As\na Pyrran operating at full blast she had as much personality as a gear\nin a machine. Once out of that pattern she reminded him more of the girl\nhe had known on that first flight to Pyrrus. He wondered if it was\npossible to really get across to her what he meant.\n\n\"I'm not being insulting when I say 'confused,' Meta. With your\nbackground you couldn't be any other way. You have an insular\npersonality. Admittedly, Pyrrus is an unusual island with a lot of\nhigh-power problems that you are an expert at solving. That doesn't make\nit any less of an island. When you face a cosmopolitan problem you are\nconfused. Or even worse, when your island problems are put into a bigger\ncontext. That's like playing your own game, only having the rules change\nconstantly as you go along.\"\n\n\"You're talking nonsense,\" she snapped at him. \"Pyrrus isn't an island\nand battling for survival is definitely not a game.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he smiled. \"I was using a figure of speech, and a badly\nchosen one at that. Let's put the problem on more concrete terms. Take\nan example. Suppose I were to tell you that over there, hanging from the\ndoorframe, was a stingwing--\"\n\nMeta's gun was pointing at the door before he finished the last word.\nThere was a crash as the guard's chair went over. He had jumped from a\nhalf-doze to full alertness in an instant, his gun also searching the\ndoorframe.\n\n\"That was just an example,\" Jason said. \"There's really nothing there.\"\nThe guard's gun vanished and he scowled a look of contempt at Jason, as\nhe righted the chair and dropped into it.\n\n\"You both have proved yourself capable of handling a Pyrran problem.\"\nJason continued. \"But what if I said that there is a thing hanging from\nthe doorframe that _looks_ like a stingwing, but is really a kind of\nlarge insect that spins a fine silk that can be used to weave clothes?\"\n\nThe guard glared from under his thick eyebrows at the empty doorframe,\nhis gun whined part way out, then snapped back into the holster. He\ngrowled something inaudible at Jason, then stamped into the outer room,\nslamming the door behind him. Meta frowned in concentration and looked\npuzzled.\n\n\"It couldn't be anything except a stingwing,\" she finally said. \"Nothing\nelse could possibly look like that. And even if it didn't spin silk, it\nwould bite if you got near, so you would have to kill it.\" She smiled\nwith satisfaction at the indestructible logic of her answer.\n\n\"Wrong again,\" Jason said. \"I just described the mimic-spinner that\nlives on Stover's Planet. It imitates the most violent forms of life\nthere, does such a good job that it has no need for other defenses.\nIt'll sit quietly on your hand and spin for you by the yard. If I\ndropped a shipload of them here on Pyrrus, you never could be sure when\nto shoot, could you?\"\n\n\"But they are not here now,\" Meta insisted.\n\n\"Yet they could be quite easily. And if they were, all the rules of your\ngame would change. Getting the idea now? There are some fixed laws and\nrules in the galaxy--but they're not the ones you live by. Your rule is\nwar unending with the local life. I want to step outside your rule book\nand end that war. Wouldn't you like that? Wouldn't you like an existence\nthat was more than just an endless battle for survival? A life with a\nchance for happiness, love, music, art--all the enjoyable things you\nhave never had the time for.\"\n\nAll the Pyrran sternness was gone from her face as she listened to what\nhe said, letting herself follow these alien concepts. He had put his\nhand out automatically as he talked, and had taken hers. It was warm and\nher pulse fast to his touch.\n\nMeta suddenly became conscious of his hand and snapped hers away, rising\nto her feet at the same time. As she started blindly towards the door,\nJason's voice snapped after her.\n\n\"The guard, Skop, ran out because he didn't want to lose his precious\ntwo-value logic. It's all he has. But you've seen other parts of the\ngalaxy, Meta, you know there is a lot more to life than\nkill-and-be-killed on Pyrrus. You feel it is true, even if you won't\nadmit it.\"\n\nShe turned and ran out the door.\n\nJason looked after her, his hand scraping the bristle on his chin\nthoughtfully. \"Meta, I have the faint hope that the woman is winning\nover the Pyrran. I think that I saw--perhaps for the first time in the\nhistory of this bloody war-torn city--a tear in one of its citizen's\neyes.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXI.\n\n\n\"Drop that equipment and Kerk will undoubtedly pull both your arms off,\"\nJason said. \"He's over there now, looking as sorry as possible that I\never talked him into this.\"\n\nSkop cursed under the bulky mass of the psi detector, passing it up to\nMeta who waited in the open port of the spaceship. Jason supervised the\nloading, and blasted all the local life that came to investigate.\nHorndevils were thick this morning and he shot four of them. He was last\naboard and closed the lock behind him.\n\n\"Where are you going to install it?\" Meta asked.\n\n\"You tell me,\" Jason said. \"I need a spot for the antenna where there\nwill be no dense metal in front of the bowl to interfere with the\nsignal. Thin plastic will do, or if worst comes to worst I can mount it\noutside the hull with a remote drive.\"\n\n\"You may have to,\" she said. \"The hull is an unbroken unit, we do all\nviewing by screen and instruments. I don't think ... wait ... there is\none place that might do.\"\n\nShe led the way to a bulge in the hull that marked one of the lifeboats.\nThey went in through the always-open lock, Skop struggling after them\nwith the apparatus.\n\n\"These lifeboats are half buried in the ship,\" Meta explained. \"They\nhave transparent front ports covered by friction shields that withdraw\nautomatically when the boat is launched.\"\n\n\"Can we pull back the shields now?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" she said. She traced the launching circuits to a junction\nbox and opened the lid. When she closed the shield relay manually, the\nheavy plates slipped back into the hull. There was a clear view, since\nmost of the viewport projected beyond the parent ship.\n\n\"Perfect,\" Jason said. \"I'll set up here. Now how do I talk to you in\nthe ship?\"\n\n\"Right here,\" she said. \"There's a pre-tuned setting on this\ncommunicator. Don't touch anything else--and particularly not this\nswitch.\" She pointed to a large pull-handle set square into the center\nof the control board. \"Emergency launching. Two seconds after that is\npulled the lifeboat is shot free. And it so happens this boat has no\nfuel.\"\n\n\"Hands off for sure,\" Jason said. \"Now have Husky there run me in a line\nwith ship's power and I'll get this stuff set up.\"\n\nThe detector was simple, though the tuning had to be precise. A\ndish-shaped antenna pulled in the signal for the delicately balanced\ndetector. There was a sharp fall-off on both sides of the input so\ndirection could be precisely determined. The resulting signal was fed to\nan amplifier stage. Unlike the electronic components of the first stage,\nthis one was drawn in symbols on white paper. Carefully glued-on input\nand output leads ran to it.\n\nWhen everything was ready and clamped into place, Jason nodded to Meta's\nimage on the screen. \"Take her up--and easy please. None of your nine-G\nspecials. Go into a slow circle around the perimeter, until I tell you\ndifferently.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder steady power the ship lifted and grabbed for altitude, then eased\ninto its circular course. They made five circuits of the city before\nJason shook his head.\n\n\"The thing seems to be working fine, but we're getting too much noise\nfrom all the local life. Get thirty kilometers out from the city and\nstart a new circuit.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe results were better this time. A powerful signal came from the\ndirection of the city, confined to less than a degree of arc. With the\nantenna fixed at a right angle to the direction of the ship's flight,\nthe signal was fairly constant. Meta rotated the ship on its main axis,\nuntil Jason's lifeboat was directly below.\n\n\"Going fine now,\" he said. \"Just hold your controls as they are and keep\nthe nose from drifting.\"\n\nAfter making a careful mark on the setting circle, Jason turned the\nreceiving antenna through one hundred eighty degrees of arc. As the ship\nkept to its circle, he made a slow collecting sweep of any signals\nbeamed at the city. They were halfway around before he got a new signal.\n\nIt was there all right, narrow but strong. Just to be sure he let the\nship complete two more sweeps, and he noted the direction on the\ngyro-compass each time. They coincided. The third time around he called\nto Meta.\n\n\"Get ready for a full right turn, or whatever you call it. I think I\nhave our bearing. Get ready--_now_.\"\n\nIt was a slow turn and Jason never lost the signal. A few times it\nwavered, but he brought it back on. When the compass settled down Meta\npushed on more power.\n\nThey set their course towards the native Pyrrans.\n\nAn hour's flight at close to top atmospheric speed brought no change.\nMeta complained, but Jason kept her on course. The signal never varied\nand was slowly picking up strength. They crossed the chain of volcanoes\nthat marked the continental limits, the ship bucking in the fierce\nthermals. Once the shore was behind and they were over water, Skop\njoined Meta in grumbling. He kept his turret spinning, but there was\nvery little to shoot at this far from land.\n\nWhen the islands came over the horizon the signal began to dip.\n\n\"Slow now,\" Jason called. \"Those islands ahead look like our source!\"\n\nA continent had been here once, floating on Pyrrus' liquid core.\nPressures changed, land masses shifted, and the continent had sunk\nbeneath the ocean. All that was left now of the teeming life of that\nland mass was confined to a chain of islands, once the mountain peaks of\nthe highest range of mountains. These islands, whose sheer, sides rose\nstraight from the water, held the last inhabitants of the lost\ncontinent. The weeded-out descendants, of the victors of uncountable\nviolent contests. Here lived the oldest native Pyrrans.\n\n\"Come in lower,\" Jason signaled. \"Towards that large peak. The signals\nseem to originate there.\"\n\nThey swooped low over the mountain, but nothing was visible other than\nthe trees and sun-blasted rock.\n\nThe pain almost took Jason's head off. A blast of hatred that drove\nthrough the amplifier and into his skull. He tore off the phones, and\nclutched his skull between his hands. Through watering eyes he saw the\nblack cloud of flying beasts hurtle up from the trees below. He had a\nsingle glimpse of the hillside beyond, before Meta blasted power to the\nengines and the ship leaped away.\n\n\"We've found them!\" Her fierce exultation faded as she saw Jason through\nthe communicator. \"Are you all right? What happened?\"\n\n\"Feel ... burned out ... I've felt a psi blast before, but nothing like\nthat! I had a glimpse of an opening, looked like a cave mouth, just\nbefore the blast hit. Seemed to come from there.\"\n\n\"Lie down,\" Meta said. \"I'll get you back as fast as I can. I'm calling\nahead to Kerk, he has to know what happened.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA group of men were waiting in the landing station when they came down.\nThey stormed out as soon as the ship touched, shielding their faces from\nthe still-hot tubes. Kerk burst in as soon as the port was cracked,\npeering around until he spotted Jason stretched out on an acceleration\ncouch.\n\n\"Is it true?\" he barked. \"You've traced the alien criminals who started\nthis war?\"\n\n\"Slow, man, slow,\" Jason said. \"I've traced the source of the psi\nmessage that keeps your war going. I've found no evidence as to who\nstarted this war, and certainly wouldn't go so far as to call them\ncriminals--\"\n\n\"I'm tired of your word-play,\" Kerk broke in. \"You've found these\ncreatures and their location has been marked.\"\n\n\"On the chart,\" Meta said, \"I could fly there blindfolded.\"\n\n\"Fine, fine,\" Kerk said, rubbing his hands together so hard they could\nhear the harsh rasp of the callouses. \"It takes a real effort to grasp\nthe idea that, after all these centuries, the war might be coming to an\nend. But it's possible now. Instead of simply killing off these\nself-renewing legions of the damned that attack us, we can get to the\nleaders. Search them out, carry the war to them for a change--and blast\ntheir stain from the face of this planet!\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort!\" Jason said, sitting up with an effort. \"Nothing\ndoing! Since I came to this planet I have been knocked around, and\nrisked my life ten times over. Do you think I have done this just to\nsatisfy your blood-thirsty ambitions? It's peace I'm after--not\ndestruction. You promised to contact these creatures, attempt to\nnegotiate with them. Aren't you a man of honor who keeps his word?\"\n\n\"I'll ignore the insult--though I'd have killed you for it at any other\ntime,\" Kerk said. \"You've been of great service to our people, we are\nnot ashamed to acknowledge an honest debt. At the same time--do not\naccuse me of breaking promises that I never made. I recall my exact\nwords. I promised to go along with any reasonable plan that would end\nthis war. That is just what I intend to do. Your plan to negotiate a\npeace is not reasonable. Therefore we are going to destroy the enemy.\"\n\n\"Think first,\" Jason called after Kerk, who had turned to leave. \"What\nis wrong with trying negotiation or an armistice? Then, if that fails,\nyou can try your way.\"\n\nThe compartment was getting crowded as other Pyrrans pushed in. Kerk,\nalmost to the door, turned back to face Jason.\n\n\"I'll tell you what's wrong with armistice,\" he said. \"It's a coward's\nway out, that's what it is. It's all right for you to suggest it, you're\nfrom off-world and don't know any better. But do you honestly think I\ncould entertain such a defeatist notion for one instant? When I speak, I\nspeak not only for myself, but for all of us here. We don't mind\nfighting, and we know how to do it. We know that if this war was over we\ncould build a better world here. At the same time, if we have the choice\nof continued war or a cowardly peace--_we vote for war_. This war will\nonly be over when the enemy is utterly destroyed!\"\n\nThe listening Pyrrans shouted in agreement, and when Kerk pushed out\nthrough the crowd some of them patted his shoulder as he went by. Jason\nslumped back on the couch, worn out by his exertions and exhausted by\nthe attempt to win the violent Pyrrans over to a peaceful point of view.\n\nWhen he looked up they were gone--all except Meta. She had the same look\nof blood-thirsty elation as the others, but it drained away when she\nglanced at him.\n\n\"What about it, Meta?\" he asked bitterly. \"No doubts? Do you think that\ndestruction is the only way to end this war?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said. \"I can't be sure. For the first time in my\nlife I find myself with more than one answer to the same question.\"\n\n\"Congratulations,\" he said. \"It's a sign of growing up.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXII.\n\n\nJason stood to one side and watched the deadly cargo being loaded into\nthe hold of the ship. The Pyrrans were in good humor as they stowed away\nriot guns, grenades and gas bombs. When the back-pack atom bomb was put\naboard one of them broke into a marching song, and the others picked it\nup. Maybe they were happy, but the approaching carnage only filled Jason\nwith an intense gloom. He felt that somehow he was a traitor to life.\nPerhaps the life form he had found needed destroying--and perhaps it\ndidn't. Without making the slightest attempt at conciliation,\ndestruction would be plain murder.\n\nKerk came out of the operations building and the starter pumps could be\nheard whining inside the ship. They would leave within minutes. Jason\nforced himself into a foot-dragging rush and met Kerk halfway to the\nship.\n\n\"I'm coming with you, Kerk. You owe me at least that much for finding\nthem.\"\n\nKerk hesitated, not liking the idea. \"This is an operational mission,\"\nhe said. \"No room for observers, and the extra weight-- And it's too\nlate to stop us Jason, you know that.\"\n\n\"You Pyrrans are the worst liars in the universe,\" Jason said. \"We both\nknow that ship can lift ten times the amount it's carrying today.\nNow ... do you let me come, or forbid me without reason at all?\"\n\n\"Get aboard,\" Kerk said. \"But keep out of the way or you'll get\ntrampled.\"\n\nThis time, with a definite destination ahead, the flight was much\nfaster. Meta took the ship into the stratosphere, in a high ballistic\narc that ended at the islands. Kerk was in the co-pilot's seat, Jason\nsat behind them where he could watch the screens. The landing party,\ntwenty-five volunteers, were in the hold below with the weapons. All the\nscreens in the ship were switched to the forward viewer. They watched\nthe green island appear and swell, then vanish behind the flames of the\nbraking rockets. Jockeying the ship carefully, Meta brought it down on a\nflat shelf near the cave mouth.\n\nJason was ready this time for the blast of mental hatred--but it still\nhurt. The gunners laughed and killed gleefully as every animal on the\nisland closed in on the ship. They were slaughtered by the thousands,\nand still more came.\n\n\"Do you have to do this?\" Jason asked. \"It's murder--carnage, just\nbutchering those beasts like that.\"\n\n\"Self-defense,\" Kerk said. \"They attack us and they get killed. What\ncould be simpler? Now shut up, or I'll throw you out there with them.\"\n\nIt was a half an hour before the gunfire slackened. Animals still\nattacked them, but the mass assaults seemed to be over. Kerk spoke into\nthe intercom.\n\n\"Landing party away--and watch your step. They know we're here and will\nmake it as hot as they can. Take the bomb into that cave and see how far\nback it runs. We can always blast them from the air, but it'll do no\ngood if they're dug into solid rock. Keep your screen open, leave the\nbomb and pull back at once if I tell you to. Now move.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe men swarmed down the ladders and formed into open battle formation.\nThey were soon under attack, but the beasts were picked off before they\ncould get close. It didn't take long for the man at point to reach the\ncave. He had his pickup trained in front of him, and the watchers in the\nship followed the advance.\n\n\"Big cave,\" Kerk grunted. \"Slants back and down. What I was afraid of.\nBomb dropped on that would just close it up. With no guarantee that\nanything sealed in it, couldn't eventually get out. We'll have to see\nhow far down it goes.\"\n\nThere was enough heat in the cave now to use the infra-red filters. The\nrock walls stood out harshly black and white as the advance continued.\n\n\"No signs of life since entering the cave,\" the officer reported.\n\"Gnawed bones at the entrance and some bat droppings. It looks like a\nnatural cave--so far.\"\n\nStep by step the advance continued, slowing as it went. Insensitive as\nthe Pyrrans were to psi pressure, even they were aware of the blast of\nhatred being continuously leveled at them. Jason, back in the ship, had\na headache that slowly grew worse instead of better.\n\n\"_Watch out!_\" Kerk shouted, staring at the screen with horror.\n\nThe cave was filled from wall to wall with pallid, eyeless animals. They\npoured from tiny side passages and seemed to literally emerge from the\nground. Their front ranks dissolved in flame, but more kept pressing in.\nOn the screen the watchers in the ship saw the cave spin dizzily as the\noperator fell. Pale bodies washed up and concealed the lens.\n\n\"Close ranks--flame-throwers and gas!\" Kerk bellowed into the mike.\n\nLess than half of the men were alive after that first attack. The\nsurvivors, protected by the flame-throwers, set off the gas grenades.\nTheir sealed battle armor protected them while the section of cave\nfilled with gas. Someone dug through the bodies of their attackers and\nfound the pickup.\n\n\"Leave the bomb there and withdraw,\" Kerk ordered. \"We've had enough\nlosses already.\"\n\nA different man stared out of the screen. The officer was dead. \"Sorry,\nsir,\" he said, \"but it will be just as easy to push ahead as back as\nlong as the gas grenades hold out. We're too close now to pull back.\"\n\n\"That's an order,\" Kerk shouted, but the man was gone from the screen\nand the advance continued.\n\nJason's fingers hurt where he had them clamped to the chair arm. He\npulled them loose and massaged them. On the screen the black and white\ncave flowed steadily towards them. Minute after minute went by this way.\nEach time the animals attacked again, a few more gas grenades were used\nup.\n\n\"Something ahead--looks different,\" the panting voice cracked from the\nspeaker. The narrow cave slowly opened out into a gigantic chamber, so\nlarge the roof and far walls were lost in the distance.\n\n\"What are those?\" Kerk asked. \"Get a searchlight over to the right\nthere.\"\n\nThe picture on the screen was fuzzy and hard to see now, dimmed by the\nlayers of rock in-between. Details couldn't be made out clearly, but it\nwas obvious this was something unusual.\n\n\"Never saw ... anything quite like them before,\" the speaker said. \"Look\nlike big plants of some kind, ten meters tall at least--yet they're\nmoving. Those branches, tentacles or whatever they are, keep pointing\ntowards us and I get the darkest feeling in my head ...\"\n\n\"Blast one, see what happens,\" Kerk said.\n\nThe gun fired and at the same instant an intensified wave of mental\nhatred rolled over the men, dropping them to the ground. They rolled in\npain, blacked out and unable to think or fight the underground beasts\nthat poured over them in renewed attack.\n\nIn the ship, far above, Jason felt the shock to his mind and wondered\nhow the men below could have lived through it. The others in the control\nroom had been hit by it as well. Kerk pounded on the frame of the screen\nand shouted to the unhearing men below.\n\n\"Pull back, come back ...\"\n\nIt was too late. The men only stirred slightly as the victorious Pyrran\nanimals washed over them, clawing for the joints in their armor. Only\none man moved, standing up and beating the creatures away with his bare\nhands. He stumbled a few feet and bent over the writhing mass below him.\nWith a heave of his shoulders he pulled another man up. The man was dead\nbut his shoulder pack was still strapped to his back. Bloody fingers\nfumbled at the pack, then both men were washed back under the wave of\ndeath.\n\n\"That was the bomb!\" Kerk shouted to Meta. \"If he didn't change the\nsetting, it's still on ten-second minimum. Get out of here!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJason had just time to fall back on the acceleration couch before the\nrockets blasted. The pressure leaned on him and kept mounting. Vision\nblacked out but he didn't lose consciousness. Air screamed across the\nhull, then the sound stopped as they left the atmosphere behind.\n\nJust as Meta cut the power a glare of white light burst from the\nscreens. They turned black instantly as the hull pickups burned out. She\nswitched filters into place, then pressed the button that rotated new\npickups into position.\n\nFar below, in the boiling sea, a climbing cloud of mushroom-shaped flame\nfilled the spot where the island had been seconds before. The three of\nthem looked at it, silently and unmoving. Kerk recovered first.\n\n\"Head for home, Meta, and get operations on the screen. Twenty-five men\ndead, but they did their job. They knocked out those beasts--whatever\nthey were--and ended the war. I can't think of a better way for a man to\ndie.\"\n\nMeta set the orbit, then called operations.\n\n\"Trouble getting through,\" she said. \"I have a robot landing beam\nresponse, but no one is answering the call.\"\n\nA man appeared on the empty screen. He was beaded with sweat and had a\nharried look in his eyes. \"Kerk,\" he said, \"is that you? Get the ship\nback here at once. We need her firepower at the perimeter. All blazes\nbroke loose a minute ago, a general attack from every side, worse than\nI've ever seen.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Kerk stammered in unbelief. \"The war is over--we\nblasted them, destroyed their headquarters completely.\"\n\n\"The war is going like it never has gone before,\" the other snapped\nback. \"I don't know what you did, but it stirred up the stewpot of hell\nhere. Now stop talking and get the ship back!\"\n\nKerk turned slowly to face Jason, his face pulled back in a look of raw\nanimal savagery.\n\n\"You--! You did it! I should have killed you the first time I saw you. I\nwanted to, now I know I was right. You've been like a plague since you\ncame here, sowing death in every direction. I knew you were wrong, yet I\nlet your twisted words convince me. And look what has happened. First\nyou killed Welf. Then you murdered those men in the cave. Now this\nattack on the perimeter--all who die there, you will have killed!\"\n\nKerk advanced on Jason, step by slow step, hatred twisting his features.\nJason backed away until he could retreat no further, his shoulders\nagainst the chart case. Kerk's hand lashed out, not a fighting blow, but\nan open slap. Though Jason rolled with it, it still battered him and\nstretched him full length on the floor. His arm was against the chart\ncase, his fingers near the sealed tubes that held the jump matrices.\n\nJason seized one of the heavy tubes with both hands and pulled it out.\nHe swung it with all his strength into Kerk's face. It broke the skin\non his cheekbone and forehead and blood ran from the cuts. But it didn't\nslow or stop the big man in the slightest. His smile held no mercy as he\nreached down and dragged Jason to his feet.\n\n\"Fight back,\" he said, \"I will have that much more pleasure as I kill\nyou.\" He drew back the granite fist that would tear Jason's head from\nhis shoulders.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Jason said, and stopped struggling. \"Kill me. You can do it\neasily. Only don't call it justice. Welf died to save me. But the men on\nthe island died because of your stupidity. I wanted peace and you wanted\nwar. Now you have it. Kill me to soothe your conscience, because the\ntruth is something you can't face up to.\"\n\nWith a bellow of rage Kerk drove the pile-driver fist down.\n\nMeta grabbed the arm in both her hands and hung on, pulling it aside\nbefore the blow could land. The three of them fell together, half\ncrushing Jason.\n\n\"Don't do it,\" she screamed. \"Jason didn't want those men to go down\nthere. That was your idea. You can't kill him for that!\"\n\nKerk, exploding with rage, was past hearing. He turned his attention to\nMeta, tearing her from him. She was a woman and her supple strength was\nmeager compared to his great muscles. But she was a Pyrran woman and she\ndid what no off-worlder could. She slowed him for a moment, stopped the\nfury of his attack until he could rip her hands loose and throw her\naside. It didn't take him long to do this, but it was just time enough\nfor Jason to get to the door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJason stumbled through, and jammed shut the lock behind him. A split\nsecond after he had driven the bolt home Kerk's weight plunged into the\ndoor. The metal screamed and bent, giving way. One hinge was torn loose\nand the other held only by a shred of metal. It would go down on the\nnext blow.\n\nJason wasn't waiting for that. He hadn't stayed to see if the door would\nstop the raging Pyrran. No door on the ship could stop him. Fast as\npossible, Jason went down the gangway. There was no safety on the ship,\nwhich meant he had to get off it. The lifeboat deck was just ahead.\n\nEver since first seeing them, he had given a lot of thought to the\nlifeboats. Though he hadn't looked ahead to this situation, he knew a\ntime might come when he would need transportation of his own. The\nlifeboats had seemed to be the best bet, except that Meta had told him\nthey had no fuel. She had been right in one thing--the boat he had been\nin had empty tanks, he had checked. There were five other boats, though,\nthat he hadn't examined. He had wondered about the idea of useless\nlifeboats and come to what he hoped was a correct conclusion.\n\nThis spaceship was the only one the Pyrrans had. Meta had told him once\nthat they always had planned to buy another ship, but never did. Some\nother necessary war expense managed to come up first. One ship was\nreally enough for their uses. The only difficulty lay in the fact they\nhad to keep that ship in operation or the Pyrran city was dead. Without\nsupplies they would be wiped out in a few months. Therefore the ship's\ncrew couldn't conceive of abandoning their ship. No matter what kind of\ntrouble she got into, they couldn't leave her. When the ship died, so\ndid their world.\n\nWith this kind of thinking, there was no need to keep the lifeboats\nfueled. Not all of them, at least. Though it stood to reason at least\none of them held fuel for short flights that would have been wasteful\nfor the parent ship. At this point Jason's chain of logic grew weak. Too\nmany \"ifs.\" _If_ they used the lifeboats at all, one of them should be\nfueled. _If_ they did, it would be fueled now. And _if_ it were\nfueled--which one of the six would it be? Jason had no time to go\nlooking. He had to be right the first time.\n\nHis reasoning had supplied him with an answer, the last of a long line\nof suppositions. If a boat were fueled, it should be the one nearest to\nthe control cabin. The one he was diving towards now. His life depended\non this string of guesses.\n\nBehind him the door went down with a crash. Kerk bellowed and leaped.\nJason hurled himself through the lifeboat port with the nearest thing to\na run he could manage under the doubled gravity. With both hands he\ngrabbed the emergency launching handle and pulled down.\n\nAn alarm bell rang and the port slammed shut, literally in Kerk's face.\nOnly his Pyrran reflexes saved him from being smashed by it.\n\nSolid-fuel launchers exploded and blasted the lifeboat clear of the\nparent ship. Their brief acceleration slammed Jason to the deck, then he\nfloated as the boat went into free fall. The main drive rockets didn't\nfire.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIn that moment Jason learned what it was like to know he was dead.\nWithout fuel the boat would drop into the jungle below, falling like a\nrock and blasting apart when it hit. There was no way out.\n\nThen the rockets caught, roared, and he dropped to the deck, bruising\nhis nose. He sat up, rubbing it and grinning. There was fuel in the\ntanks--the delay in starting had only been part of the launching cycle,\ngiving the lifeboat time to fall clear of the ship. Now to get it under\ncontrol. He pulled himself into the pilot's seat.\n\nThe altimeter had fed information to the autopilot, leveling the boat\noff parallel to the ground. Like all lifeboat controls these were\nchildishly simple, designed to be used by novices in an emergency. The\nautopilot could not be shut off, it rode along with the manual controls,\ntempering foolish piloting. Jason hauled the control wheel into a tight\nturn and the autopilot gentled it to a soft curve.\n\nThrough the port he could see the big ship blaring fire in a much\ntighter turn. Jason didn't know who was flying it or what they had in\nmind--he took no chances. Jamming the wheel forward into a dive he\ncursed as they eased into a gentle drop. The larger ship had no such\nrestrictions. It changed course with a violent maneuver and dived on\nhim. The forward turret fired and an explosion at the stern rocked the\nlittle boat. This either knocked out the autopilot or shocked it into\nsubmission. The slow drop turned into a power dive and the jungle\nbillowed up.\n\nJason pulled the wheel back and there was just time to get his arms in\nfront of his face before they hit.\n\nThundering rockets and cracking trees ended in a great splash. Silence\nfollowed and the smoke drifted away. High above, the spaceship circled\nhesitantly. Dropping a bit as if wanting to go down and investigate.\nThen rising again as the urgent message for aid came from the city.\nLoyalty won and she turned and spewed fire towards home.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII.\n\n\nTree branches had broken the lifeboat's fall, the bow rockets had burned\nout in emergency blast, and the swamp had cushioned the landing a bit.\nIt was still a crash. The battered cylinder sank slowly into the\nstagnant water and thin mud of the swamp. The bow was well under before\nJason managed to kick open the emergency hatch in the waist.\n\nThere was no way of knowing how long it would take for the boat to go\nunder, and Jason was in no condition to ponder the situation. Concussed\nand bloody, he had just enough drive left to get himself out. Wading and\nfalling he made his way to firmer land, sitting down heavily as soon as\nhe found something that would support him.\n\nBehind him the lifeboat burbled and sank under the water. Bubbles of\ntrapped air kept rising for a while, then stopped. The water stilled\nand, except for the broken branches and trees, there was no sign that a\nship had ever come this way.\n\nInsects whined across the swamp, and the only sound that broke the quiet\nof the woods beyond was the cruel scream of an animal pulling down its\ndinner. When that had echoed away in tiny waves of sound everything was\nsilent.\n\nJason pulled himself out of the half trance with an effort. His body\nfelt like it had been through a meat grinder, and it was almost\nimpossible to think with the fog in his head. After minutes of\ndeliberation he figured out that the medikit was what he needed. The\neasy-off snap was very difficult and the button release didn't work. He\nfinally twisted his arm around until it was under the orifice and\npressed the entire unit down. It buzzed industriously, though he\ncouldn't feel the needles, he guessed it had worked. His sight spun\ndizzily for a while then cleared. Pain-killers went to work and he\nslowly came out of the dark cloud that had enveloped his brain since the\ncrash.\n\nReason returned and loneliness rode along with it. He was without food,\nfriendless, surrounded by the hostile forces of an alien planet. There\nwas a rising panic that started deep inside of him, that took\nconcentrated effort to hold down.\n\n\"Think, Jason, don't emote,\" he said it aloud to reassure himself, but\nwas instantly sorry, because his voice sounded weak in the emptiness,\nwith a ragged edge of hysteria to it. Something caught in his throat and\nhe coughed to clear it, spitting out blood. Looking at the red stain he\nwas suddenly angry. Hating this deadly planet and the incredible\nstupidity of the people who lived on it. Cursing out loud was better and\nhis voice didn't sound as weak now. He ended up shouting and shaking his\nfist at nothing in particular, but it helped. The anger washed away the\nfear and brought him back to reality.\n\nSitting on the ground felt good now. The sun was warm and when he leaned\nback he could almost forget the unending burden of doubled gravity.\nAnger had carried away fear, rest erased fatigue. From somewhere in the\nback of his mind there popped up the old platitude. _Where there's life,\nthere's hope._ He grimaced at the triteness of the words, at the same\ntime realizing that a basic truth lurked there.\n\nCount his assets. Well battered, but still alive. None of the bruises\nseemed very important, and no bones were broken. His gun was still\nworking, it dipped in and out of the power holster as he thought about\nit. Pyrrans made rugged equipment. The medikit was operating as well. If\nhe kept his senses, managed to walk in a fairly straight line and could\nlive off the land, there was a fair chance he might make it back to the\ncity. What kind of a reception would be waiting for him there was a\ndifferent matter altogether. He would find that out after he arrived.\nGetting there had first priority.\n\nOn the debit side there stood the planet Pyrrus. Strength-sapping\ngravity, murderous weather, and violent animals. Could he survive? As if\nto add emphasis to his thoughts, the sky darkened over and rain hissed\ninto the forest, marching towards him. Jason scrambled to his feet and\ntook a bearing before the rain closed down visibility. A jagged chain of\nmountains stood dimly on the horizon, he remembered crossing them on the\nflight out. They would do as a first goal. After he had reached them, he\nwould worry about the next leg of the journey.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLeaves and dirt flew before the wind in quick gusts, then the rain\nwashed over him. Soaked, chilled, already bone-tired, he pitted the\ntottering strength of his legs against the planet of death.\n\nWhen nightfall came it was still raining. There was no way of being sure\nof the direction, and no point in going on. If that wasn't enough, Jason\nwas on the ragged edge of exhaustion. It was going to be a wet night.\nAll the trees were thick-boled and slippery, he couldn't have climbed\nthem on a one-G world. The sheltered spots that he investigated, under\nfallen trees and beneath thick bushes, were just as wet as the rest of\nthe forest. In the end he curled up on the leeward side of a tree, and\nfell asleep, shivering, with the water dripping off him.\n\nThe rain stopped around midnight and the temperature fell sharply. Jason\nwoke sluggishly from a dream in which he was being frozen to death, to\nfind it was almost true. Fine snow was sifting through the trees,\npowdering the ground and drifting against him. The cold bit into his\nflesh, and when he sneezed it hurt his chest. His aching and numb body\nonly wanted rest, but the spark of reason that remained in him, forced\nhim to his feet. If he lay down now, he would die. Holding one hand\nagainst the tree so he wouldn't fall, he began to trudge around it. Step\nafter shuffling step, around and around, until the terrible cold eased a\nbit and he could stop shivering. Fatigue crawled up him like a muffling,\ngray blanket. He kept on walking, half the time with his eyes closed.\nOpening them only when he fell and had to climb painfully to his feet\nagain.\n\nThe sun burned away the snow clouds at dawn. Jason leaned against his\ntree and blinked up at the sky with sore eyes. The ground was white in\nall directions, except around the tree where his stumbling feet had\nchurned a circle of black mud. His back against the smooth trunk, Jason\nsank slowly down to the ground, letting the sun soak into him.\n\nExhaustion had him light-headed, and his lips were cracked from thirst.\nAlmost continuous coughing tore at his chest with fingers of fire.\nThough the sun was still low it was hot already, burning his skin dry.\nDry and hot.\n\nIt wasn't right. This thought kept nagging at his brain until he\nadmitted it. Turned it over and over and looked at it from all sides.\nWhat wasn't right? The way he felt.\n\nPneumonia. He had all the symptoms.\n\nHis dry lips cracked and blood moistened them when he smiled. He had\navoided all the animal perils of Pyrrus, all the big carnivores and\npoisonous reptiles, only to be laid low by the smallest beast of them\nall. Well, he had the remedy for this one, too. Rolling up his sleeve\nwith shaking fingers, he pressed the mouth of the medikit to his bare\narm. It clicked and began to drone an angry whine. That meant something,\nhe knew, but he just couldn't remember what. Holding it up he saw that\none of the hypodermics was projecting halfway from its socket. Of\ncourse. It was empty of whatever antibiotic the analyzer had called for.\nIt needed refilling.\n\nJason hurled the thing away with a curse, and it splashed into a pool\nand was gone. End of medicine, end of medikit, end of Jason dinAlt.\nSingle-handed battler against the perils of deathworld. Strong-hearted\nstranger who could do as well as the natives. It had taken him all of\none day on his own to get his death warrant signed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA choking growl echoed behind him. He turned, dropped and fired in the\nsame motion. It was all over before his conscious mind was aware it had\nhappened. Pyrran training had conditioned his reflexes on the\npre-cortical level. Jason gaped at the ugly beast dying not a meter from\nhim and realized he had been trained well.\n\nHis first reaction was unhappiness that he had killed one of the grubber\ndogs. When he looked closer he realized this animal was slightly\ndifferent in markings, size and temper. Though most of its forequarters\nwere blown away, blood pumping out in dying spurts, it kept trying to\nreach Jason. Before the eyes glazed with death it had struggled its way\nalmost to his feet.\n\nIt wasn't quite a grubber dog, though chances were it was a wild\nrelative. Bearing the same relation as dog to wolf. He wondered if there\nwere any other resemblances between wolves and this dead beast. Did they\nhunt in packs, too?\n\nAs soon as the thought hit him he looked up--not a moment too soon. The\ngreat forms were drifting through the trees, closing in on him. When he\nshot two, the others snarled with rage and sank back into the forest.\nThey didn't leave. Instead of being frightened by the deaths they grew\neven more enraged.\n\nJason sat with his back to the tree and waited until they came close\nbefore he picked them off. With each shot and dying scream the outraged\nsurvivors howled the louder. Some of them fought when they met, venting\ntheir rage. One stood on his hind legs and raked great strips of bark\nfrom a tree. Jason aimed a shot at it, but he was too far away to hit.\n\nThere were advantages to having a fever, he realized. Logically he knew\nhe would live only to sunset, or until his gun was empty. Yet the fact\ndidn't bother him greatly. Nothing really mattered. He slumped, relaxed\ncompletely, only raising his arm to fire, then letting it drop again.\nEvery few minutes he had to move to look in back of the tree, and kill\nany of them that were stalking him in the blind spot. He wished dimly\nthat he were leaning against a smaller tree, but it wasn't worth the\neffort to go to one.\n\nSometime in the afternoon he fired his last shot. It killed an animal he\nhad allowed to get close. He had noticed he was missing the longer\nshots. The beast snarled and dropped, the others that were close pulled\nback and howled in sympathy. One of them exposed himself and Jason\npulled the trigger.\n\nThere was only a slight click. He tried again, in case it was just a\nmisfire, but there was still only the click. The gun was empty, as was\nthe spare clip pouch at his belt. There were vague memories of\nreloading, though he couldn't remember how many times he had done it.\n\nThis, then, was the end. They had all been right, Pyrrus was a match for\nhim. Though they shouldn't talk. It would kill them all in the end, too.\nPyrrans never died in bed. Old Pyrrans never died, they just got et.\n\nNow that he didn't have to force himself to stay alert and hold the gun,\nthe fever took hold. He wanted to sleep and he knew it would be a long\nsleep. His eyes were almost closed as he watched the wary carnivores\nslip closer to him. The first one crept close enough to spring, he could\nsee the muscles tensing in its leg.\n\nIt leaped. Whirling in midair and falling before it reached him. Blood\nran from its gaping mouth and the short shaft of metal projected from\nthe side of his head.\n\nThe two men walked out of the brush and looked down at him. Their mere\npresence seemed to have been enough for the carnivores, because they all\nvanished.\n\nGrubbers. He had been in such a hurry to reach the city that he had\nforgotten about the grubbers. It was good that they were here and Jason\nwas very glad they had come. He couldn't talk very well, so he smiled to\nthank them. But this hurt his lips too much so he went to sleep.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV.\n\n\nFor a strange length of time after that, there were only hazy patches of\nmemory that impressed themselves on Jason. A sense of movement and large\nbeasts around him. Walls, wood-smoke, the murmur of voices. None of it\nmeant very much and he was too tired to care. It was easier and much\nbetter just to let go.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"About time,\" Rhes said. \"A couple more days lying there like that and\nwe would have buried you, even if you were still breathing.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJason blinked at him, trying to focus the face that swam above him. He\nfinally recognized Rhes, and wanted to answer him. But talking only\nbrought on a spell of body-wracking coughing. Someone held a cup to his\nlips and sweet fluid trickled down his throat. He rested, then tried\nagain.\n\n\"How long have I been here?\" The voice was thin and sounded far away.\nJason had trouble recognizing it for his own.\n\n\"Eight days. And why didn't you listen when I talked to you?\" Rhes\nsaid.\n\n\"You should have stayed near the ship when you crashed. Didn't you\nremember what I said about coming down anywhere on this continent? No\nmatter, too late to worry about that. Next time listen to what I say.\nOur people moved fast and reached the site of the wreck before dark.\nThey found the broken trees and the spot where the ship had sunk, and at\nfirst thought whoever had been in it had drowned. Then one of the dogs\nfound your trail, but lost it again in the swamps during the night. They\nhad a fine time with the mud and the snow and didn't have any luck at\nall in finding the spoor again. By the next afternoon they were ready to\nsend for more help when they heard your firing. Just made it, from what\nI hear. Lucky one of them was a talker and could tell the wild dogs to\nclear out. Would have had to kill them all otherwise, and that's not\nhealthy.\"\n\n\"Thanks for saving my neck,\" Jason said. \"That was closer than I like to\ncome. What happened after? I was sure I was done for, I remember that\nmuch. Diagnosed all the symptoms of pneumonia. Guaranteed fatal in my\ncondition without treatment. Looks like you were wrong when you said\nmost of your remedies were useless--they seemed to work well on me.\"\n\nHis voice died off as Rhes shook his head in a slow _no_, lines of worry\nsharp-cut into his face. Jason looked around and saw Naxa and another\nman. They had the same deeply unhappy expressions as Rhes.\n\n\"What is it?\" Jason asked, feeling the trouble. \"If your remedies didn't\nwork--what did? Not my medikit. That was empty. I remember losing it or\nthrowing it away.\"\n\n\"You were dying,\" Rhes said slowly. \"We couldn't cure you. Only a\njunkman medicine machine could do that. We got one from the driver of\nthe food truck.\"\n\n\"But how?\" Jason asked, dazed. \"You told me the city forbids you\nmedicine. He couldn't give you his own medikit. Not unless he was--\"\n\nRhes nodded and finished the sentence. \"Dead. Of course he was dead. I\nkilled him myself, with a great deal of pleasure.\"\n\nThis hit Jason hard. He sagged against the pillows and thought of all\nthose who had died since he had come to Pyrrus. The men who had died to\nsave him, died so he could live, died because of his ideas. It was a\nburden of guilt that he couldn't bear to think about. Would it stop with\nKrannon--or would the city people try to avenge his death?\n\n\"Don't you realize what that means!\" he gasped out the words. \"Krannon's\ndeath will turn the city against you. There'll be no more supplies.\nThey'll attack you when they can, kill your people--\"\n\n\"Of course we know that!\" Rhes leaned forward, his voice hoarse and\nintense. \"It wasn't an easy decision to come to. We have always had a\ntrading agreement with the junkmen. The trading trucks were inviolate.\nThis was our last and only link to the galaxy outside and eventual hope\nof contacting them.\"\n\n\"Yet you broke that link to save me--why?\"\n\n\"Only you can answer that question completely. There was a great attack\non the city and we saw their walls broken, they had to be moved back at\none place. At the same time the spaceship was over the ocean, dropping\nbombs of some kind--the flash was reported. Then the ship returned and\n_you_ left it in a smaller ship. They fired at you but didn't kill you.\nThe little ship wasn't destroyed either, we are starting to raise it\nnow. What does it all mean? We had no way of telling. We only knew it\nwas something vitally important. You were alive, but would obviously die\nbefore you could talk. The small ship might be repaired to fly, perhaps\nthat was your plan and that is why you stole it for us. We _couldn't_\nlet you die, not even if it meant all-out war with the city. The\nsituation was explained to all of our people who could be reached by\nscreen and they voted to save you. I killed the junkman for his\nmedicine, then rode two doryms to death to get here in time.\n\n\"Now tell us--what does it mean? What is your plan? How will it help\nus?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGuilt leaned on Jason and stifled his mouth. A fragment of an ancient\nlegend cut across his mind, about the jonah who wrecked the spacer so\nall in it died, yet he lived. Was that he? Had he wrecked a world? Could\nhe dare admit to these people that he had taken the lifeboat only to\nsave his own life?\n\nThe three Pyrrans leaned forward, waiting for his words. Jason closed\nhis eyes so he wouldn't see their faces. What could he tell them? If he\nadmitted the truth they would undoubtedly kill him on the spot,\nconsidering it only justice. He wasn't fearful for his own life any\nmore, but if he died the other deaths would all have been in vain. And\nthere still was a way to end this planetary war. All the facts were\navailable now, it was just a matter of putting them together. If only he\nwasn't so tired, he could see the solution. It was right there, lurking\naround a corner in his brain, waiting to be dragged out.\n\nWhatever he did, he couldn't admit the truth now. If he died all hope\ndied. He had to lie to gain time, then find the true solution as soon as\nhe was able. That was all he could do.\n\n\"You were right,\" Jason said haltingly. \"The small ship has an\ninterstellar drive in it. Perhaps it can still be saved. Even if it\ncan't there is another way. I can't explain now, but I will tell you\nwhen I am rested. Don't worry. The fight is almost over.\"\n\nThey laughed and pounded each other on the back. When they came to shake\nhis hand as well, he closed his eyes and made believe he was asleep. It\nis very hard to be a hypocrite if you aren't trained for it.\n\nRhes woke him early the next morning. \"Do you feel well enough to\ntravel?\" he asked.\n\n\"Depends what you mean by travel,\" Jason told him. \"If you mean under my\nown power, I doubt if I could get as far as that door.\"\n\n\"You'll be carried,\" Rhes broke in. \"We have a litter swung between two\ndoryms. Not too comfortable, but you'll get there. But only if you think\nyou are well enough to move. We called all the people within riding\ndistance and they are beginning to gather. By this afternoon we will\nhave enough men and doryms to pull the ship out of the swamp.\"\n\n\"I'll come,\" Jason said, pushing himself to a sitting position. The\neffort exhausted him, bringing a wave of nausea. Only by leaning his\nfull weight against the wall could he keep from falling back. He sat,\npropped there, until he heard shouts and the stamping of heavy feet\noutside, and they came to carry him out.\n\nThe trip drained away his small store of energy, and he fell into an\nexhausted sleep. When he opened his eyes the doryms were standing knee\ndeep in the swamp and the salvage operation had begun. Ropes vanished\nout of sight in the water while lines of struggling animals and men\nhauled at them. The beasts bellowed, the men cursed as they slipped and\nfell. All of the Pyrrans tugging on the lines weren't male, women were\nthere as well. Shorter on the average than the men, they were just as\nbrawny. Their clothing was varied and many-colored, the first touch of\ndecoration Jason had seen on this planet.\n\nGetting the ship up was a heart-breaking job. The mud sucked at it and\nunderwater roots caught on the vanes. Divers plunged time and again into\nthe brown water to cut them free. Progress was incredibly slow, but the\nwork never stopped. Jason's brain was working even slower. The ship\nwould be hauled up eventually--what would he do then? He had to have a\nnew plan by that time, but thinking was impossible work. His thoughts\ncorkscrewed and he had to fight down the rising feeling of panic.\n\nThe sun was low when the ship's nose finally appeared above the water. A\nragged cheer broke out at first sight of that battered cone of metal and\nthey went ahead with new energy.\n\nJason was the first one who noticed the dorym weaving towards them. The\ndogs saw it, of course, and ran out and sniffed. The rider shouted to\nthe dogs and kicked angrily at the sides of his mount. Even at this\ndistance Jason could see the beast's heaving sides and yellow\nfoam-flecked hide. It was barely able to stagger now and the man jumped\ndown, running ahead on foot. He was shouting something as he ran that\ncouldn't be heard above the noise.\n\nThere was a single moment when the sounds slacked a bit and the running\nman's voice could be heard. He was calling the same word over and over\nagain. It sounded like _wait_, but Jason couldn't be sure. Others had\nheard him though, and the result was instantaneous. They stopped,\nunmoving, where they were. Many of those holding the ropes let go of\nthem. Only the quick action of the anchor men kept the ship from sliding\nback under, dragging the harnessed doryms with it. A wave of silence\nwashed across the swamp in the wake of the running man's shouts. They\ncould be heard clearly now.\n\n\"_Quake! Quake on the way! South--only safe way is south!_\"\n\nOne by one the ropes dropped back into the water and the Pyrrans turned\nto wade to solid land. Before they were well started Rhes' voice cracked\nout.\n\n\"Stay at work! Get the ship up, it's our only hope now. I'll talk to\nHananas, find out how much time we have.\"\n\nThese solitary people were unused to orders. They stopped and milled\nabout, reason fighting with the urgent desire to run. One by one they\nstepped back to the ropes as they worked out the sense of Rhes' words.\nAs soon as it was clear the work would continue he turned away.\n\n\"What is it? What's happening?\" Jason called to him as he ran by.\n\n\"It's Hananas,\" Rhes said, stopping by the litter, waiting for the\nnewcomer to reach him. \"He's a quakeman. They know when quakes are\ncoming, before they happen.\"\n\nHananas ran up, panting and tired. He was a short man, built like a\nbarrel on stubby legs, a great white beard covering his neck and the top\nof his chest. Another time Jason might have laughed at his incongruous\nwaddle, but not now. There was a charged difference in the air since the\nlittle man had arrived.\n\n\"Why didn't ... you have somebody near a plate? I called all over this\narea without an answer. Finally ... had to come myself--\"\n\n\"How much time do we have?\" Rhes cut in. \"We have to get that ship up\nbefore we pull out.\"\n\n\"Time! Who knows about time!\" the graybeard cursed. \"Get out or you're\ndead.\"\n\n\"Calm down, Han,\" Rhes said in a quieter voice, taking the oldster's\narms in both his hands. \"You know what we're doing here--and how much\ndepends on getting the ship up. Now how does it feel? This going to be a\nfast one or a slow one?\"\n\n\"Fast. Faster than anything I felt in a long time. She's starting far\naway though, if you had a plate here I bet Mach or someone else up near\nthe firelands would be reporting new eruptions. It's on the way and, if\nwe don't get out soon, we're not getting out t'all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a burble of water as the ship was hauled out a bit farther. No\none talked now and there was a fierce urgency in their movements. Jason\nstill wasn't sure exactly what had happened.\n\n\"Don't shoot me for a foreigner,\" he said, \"but just what is wrong? Are\nyou expecting earthquakes here, are you sure?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" Hananas screeched. \"Of course I'm sure. If I wasn't sure I\nwouldn't be a quakeman. It's on the way.\"\n\n\"There's no doubt of that,\" Rhes added. \"I don't know how you can tell\non your planet when quakes or vulcanism are going to start, machines\nmaybe. We have nothing like that. But quakemen, like Hananas here,\nalways know about them before they happen. If the word can be passed\nfast enough, we get away. The quake is coming all right, the only thing\nin doubt is how much time we have.\"\n\nThe work went on and there was a good chance they would die long before\nit was finished. All for nothing. The only way Jason could get them to\nstop would be to admit the ship was useless. He would be killed then and\nthe grubber chances would die with him. He chewed his lip as the sun set\nand the work continued by torchlight.\n\nHananas paced around, grumbling under his breath, halting only to glance\nat the northern horizon. The people felt his restlessness and\ntransmitted it to the animals. Dogfights broke out and the doryms pulled\nreluctantly at their harnesses. With each passing second their chances\ngrew slimmer and Jason searched desperately for a way out of the trap of\nhis own constructing.\n\n\"Look--\" someone said, and they all turned. The sky to the north was lit\nwith a red light. There was a rumble in the ground that was felt more\nthan heard. The surface of the water blurred, then broke into patterns\nof tiny waves. Jason turned away from the light, looking at the water\nand the ship. It was higher now, the top of the stern exposed. There was\na gaping hole here, blasted through the metal by the spaceship's guns.\n\n\"Rhes,\" he called, his words jammed together in the rush to get them\nout. \"Look at the ship, at the hole blasted in her stern. I landed on\nthe rockets and didn't know how badly she was hit. But the guns hit the\nstar drive!\"\n\nRhes gaped at him unbelievingly as he went on. Improvising, playing by\near, trying to manufacture lies that rang of the truth.\n\n\"I watched them install the drive--it's an auxiliary to the other\nengines. It was bolted to the hull right there. It's gone now, blown up.\nThe boat will never leave this planet, much less go to another star.\"\n\nHe couldn't look Rhes in the eyes after that. He sank back into the furs\nthat had been propped behind him, feeling the weakness even more. Rhes\nwas silent and Jason couldn't tell if his story had been believed. Only\nwhen the Pyrran bent and slashed the nearest rope did he know he had\nwon.\n\nThe word passed from man to man and the ropes were cut silently. Behind\nthem the ship they had labored so hard over, sank back into the water.\nNone of them watched. Each was locked in his own world of thought as\nthey formed up to leave. As soon as the doryms were saddled and packed\nthey started out, Hananas leading the way. Within minutes they were all\nmoving, a single file that vanished into the darkness.\n\nJason's litter had to be left behind, it would have been smashed to\npieces in the night march. Rhes pulled him up into the saddle before\nhim, locking his body into place with a steel-hard arm. The trek\ncontinued.\n\nWhen they left the swamp they changed directions sharply. A little later\nJason knew why, when the southern sky exploded. Flames lit the scene\nbrightly, ashes sifted down and hot lumps of rock crashed into the\ntrees. They steamed when they hit, and if it hadn't been for the earlier\nrain they would have been faced with a forest fire as well.\n\nSomething large loomed up next to the line of march, and when they\ncrossed an open space Jason looked at it in the reflected light from the\nsky.\n\n\"Rhes--\" he choked, pointing. Rhes looked at the great beast moving next\nto them, shaggy body and twisted horns as high as their shoulders, then\nlooked away. He wasn't frightened or apparently interested. Jason looked\naround then and began to understand.\n\nAll of the fleeing animals made no sound, that's why he hadn't noticed\nthem before. But on both sides dark forms ran between the trees. Some he\nrecognized, most of them he didn't. For a few minutes a pack of wild\ndogs ran near them, even mingling with the domesticated dogs. No notice\nwas taken. Flying things flapped overhead. Under the greater threat of\nthe volcanoes all other battles were forgotten. Life respected life. A\nherd of fat, piglike beasts with curling tusks, blundered through the\nline. The doryms slowed, picking their steps carefully so they wouldn't\nstep on them. Smaller animals sometimes clung to the backs of the bigger\nones, riding untouched a while, before they leaped off.\n\nPounded mercilessly by the saddle, Jason fell wearily into a light\nsleep. It was shot through with dreams of the rushing animals, hurrying\non forever in silence. With his eyes open or shut he saw the same\nendless stream of beasts.\n\nIt all meant something, and he frowned as he tried to think what.\nAnimals running, Pyrran animals.\n\nHe sat bolt upright suddenly, wide awake, staring down in comprehension.\n\n\"What is it?\" Rhes asked.\n\n\"Go on,\" Jason said. \"Get us out of this, and get us out safely. I told\nyou the lifeboat wasn't the only answer. I know how your people can get\nwhat they want--end the war now. There _is_ a way, and I know how it can\nbe done.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXV.\n\n\nThere were few coherent memories of the ride. Some things stood out\nsharply like the spaceship-sized lump of burning scoria that had plunged\ninto a lake near them, showering the line with hot drops of water. But\nmostly it was just a seemingly endless ride, with Jason still too weak\nto care much about it. By dawn the danger area was behind them and the\nmarch had slowed to a walk. The animals had vanished as the quake was\nleft behind, going their own ways, still in silent armistice.\n\nThe peace of mutually shared danger was over, Jason found that out when\nthey stopped to rest and eat. He and Rhes went to sit on the soft grass,\nnear a fallen tree. A wild dog had arrived there first. It lay under the\nlog, muscles tensed, the ruddy morning light striking a red glint from\nits eyes. Rhes faced it, not three meters away, without moving a muscle.\nHe made no attempt to reach one of his weapons or to call for help.\nJason stood still as well, hoping the Pyrran knew what he was doing.\n\nWith no warning at all the dog sprang straight at them. Jason fell\nbackwards as Rhes pushed him aside. The Pyrran dropped at the same\ntime--only now his hand held the long knife, yanked from the sheath\nstrapped to his thigh. With unseen speed the knife came up, the dog\ntwisted in midair, trying to bite it. Instead it sank in behind the\ndog's forelegs, the beast's own weight tearing a deadly gaping wound the\nlength of its body. It was still alive when it hit the ground, but Rhes\nwas astraddle it, pulling back the bony-plated head to cut the soft\nthroat underneath.\n\nThe Pyrran carefully cleaned his knife on the dead animal's fur, then\nreturned it to the sheath. \"They're usually no trouble,\" he said\nquietly, \"but it was excited. Probably lost the rest of the pack in the\nquake.\" His actions were the direct opposite of the city Pyrrans. He had\nnot looked for trouble nor started the fight. Instead he had avoided it\nas long as he could. But when the beast charged it had been neatly and\nefficiently dispatched. Now, instead of gloating over his victory, he\nseemed troubled over an unnecessary death.\n\nIt made sense. Everything on Pyrrus made sense. Now he knew how the\ndeadly planetary battle had started--and he knew how it could be ended.\nAll the deaths had _not_ been in vain. Each one had helped him along the\nroad a little more towards the final destination. There was just one\nfinal thing to be done.\n\nRhes was watching him now, and he knew they shared the same thoughts.\n\"Explain yourself,\" Rhes said. \"What did you mean when you said we could\nwipe out the junkmen and get our freedom?\"\n\nJason didn't bother to correct the misquote, it was best they consider\nhim a hundred per cent on their side.\n\n\"Get the others together and I'll tell you. I particularly want to see\nNaxa and any other talkers who are here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey gathered quickly when the word was passed. All of them knew that\nthe junkman had been killed to save this off-worlder, that their hope of\nsalvation lay with him. Jason looked at the crowd of faces turned\ntowards him and reached for the right words to tell them what had to be\ndone. It didn't help to know that many of them would be killed doing it.\n\n\"The small star ship can't be used,\" he said. \"You all saw that it was\nruined beyond repair. But that was the easy way out. The hard way is\nstill left. Though some of you may die, in the long run it will be the\nbest solution.\n\n\"We are going to invade the city, break through the perimeter. I know\nhow it can be done ...\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nA mutter of sound spread across the crowd. Some of them looked excited,\nhappy with the thought of killing their hereditary enemies. Others\nstared at Jason as if he were mad. A few were dazed at the magnitude of\nthe thought, this carrying of the battle to the stronghold of the\nheavily armed enemy. They quieted when Jason raised his hand.\n\n\"I know it sounds impossible,\" he said. \"But let me explain. Something\nmust be done--and now is the time to do it. The situation can only get\nworse from now on. The city Pyrr ... the junkmen can get along without\nyour food, their concentrates taste awful but they sustain life. But\nthey are going to turn against you in every way they can. No more metals\nfor your tools or replacements for your electronic equipment. Their\nhatred will probably make them seek out your farms and destroy them from\nthe ship. All of this won't be comfortable--and there will be worse to\ncome. In the city they are losing their war against this planet. Each\nyear there are less of them, and some day they will all be dead. Knowing\nhow they feel I am sure they will destroy their ship first, and the\nentire planet as well, if that is possible.\"\n\n\"How can we stop them?\" someone called out.\n\n\"By hitting _now_,\" Jason answered. \"I know all the details of the city\nand I know how the defenses are set up. Their perimeter is designed to\nprotect them from animal life, but we could break through it if we were\nreally determined.\"\n\n\"What good would that do?\" Rhes snapped. \"We crack the perimeter and\nthey draw back--then counter-attack in force. How can we stand against\ntheir weapons?\"\n\n\"We won't have to. Their spaceport touches the perimeter, and I know the\nexact spot where the ship stands. That is the place where we will break\nthrough. There is no formal guard on the ship and only a few people in\nthe area. We will capture the ship. Whether we can fly it or not is\nunimportant. Who controls the ship controls Pyrrus. Once there we\nthreaten to destroy it if they don't meet our terms. They have the\nchoice of mass suicide or co-operation. I hope they have the brains to\nco-operate.\"\n\nHis words shocked them into silence for an instant, then they surged\ninto a wave of sound. There was no agreement, just excitement, and Rhes\nfinally brought them to order.\n\n\"Quiet!\" he shouted. \"Wait until Jason finishes before you decide. We\nstill haven't heard how this proposed invasion is to be accomplished.\"\n\n\"The plan I have depends on the talkers.\" Jason said. \"Is Naxa there?\"\nHe waited until the fur-wrapped man had pushed to the front. \"I want to\nknow more about the talkers, Naxa. I know you can speak to doryms and\nthe dogs here--but what about the wild animals? Can you make them do\nwhat you want?\"\n\n\"They're animals ... course we can talk t'them. Th'more talkers, th'more\npower. Make 'em do just what we want.\"\n\n\"Then the attack will work,\" Jason said excitedly. \"Could you get your\ntalkers all on one side of the city--the opposite side from the\nspaceport--and stir the animals up? Make them attack the perimeter?\"\n\n\"Could we!\" Naxa shouted, carried away by the idea. \"We'd bring in\nanimals from all over, start th'biggest attack they ev'r saw!\"\n\n\"Then that's it. Your talkers will launch the attack on the far side of\nthe perimeter. If you keep out of sight, the guards will have no idea\nthat it is anything more than an animal attack. I've seen how they work.\nAs an attack mounts they call for reserves inside the city and drain men\naway from the other parts of the perimeter. At the height of the battle,\nwhen they have all their forces committed across the city, I'll lead the\nattack that will break through and capture the ship. That's the plan and\nit's going to work.\"\n\nJason sat down then, half fell down, drained of strength. He lay and\nlistened as the debate went back and forth, Rhes ordering it and keeping\nit going. Difficulties were raised and eliminated. No one could find a\nbasic fault with the plan. There were plenty of flaws in it, things that\nmight go wrong, but Jason didn't mention them. These people wanted his\nidea to work and they were going to make it work.\n\nIt finally broke up and they moved away. Rhes came over to Jason.\n\n\"The basics are settled,\" he said. \"All here are in agreement. They are\nspreading the word by messenger to all the talkers. The talkers are the\nheart of the attack, and the more we have, the better it will go off. We\ndon't dare use the screens to call them, there is a good chance that the\njunkmen can intercept our messages. It will take five days before we are\nready to go ahead.\"\n\n\"I'll need all of that time if I'm to be any good,\" Jason said. \"Now\nlet's get some rest.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXVI.\n\n\n\"It's a strange feeling,\" Jason said. \"I've never really seen the\nperimeter from this side before. Ugly is about the only word for it.\"\n\nHe lay on his stomach next to Rhes, looking through a screen of leaves,\ndownhill towards the perimeter. They were both wrapped in heavy furs, in\nspite of the midday heat, with thick leggings and leather gauntlets to\nprotect their hands. The gravity and the heat were already making Jason\ndizzy, but he forced himself to ignore this.\n\nAhead, on the far side of a burnt corridor, stood the perimeter. A high\nwall, of varying height and texture, seemingly made of everything in the\nworld. It was impossible to tell what it had originally been constructed\nof. Generations of attackers had bruised, broken, and undermined it.\nRepairs had been quickly made, patches thrust roughly into place and\nfixed there. Crude masonry crumbled and gave way to a rat's nest of\nwoven timbers. This overlapped a length of pitted metal, large plates\nriveted together. Even this metal had been eaten through and bursting\nsandbags spilled out of a jagged hole. Over the surface of the wall\ndetector wires and charged cables looped and hung. At odd intervals\nautomatic flame-throwers thrust their nozzles over the wall above and\nswept the base of the wall clear of any life that might have come close.\n\n\"Those flame things can cause us trouble,\" Rhes said. \"That one covers\nthe area where you want to break in.\"\n\n\"It'll be no problem,\" Jason assured him. \"It may look like it is firing\na random pattern, but it's really not. It varies a simple sweep just\nenough to fool an animal, but was never meant to keep men out. Look for\nyourself. It fires at regularly repeated two, four, three and one minute\nintervals.\"\n\nThey crawled back to the hollow where Naxa and the others waited for\nthem. There were only thirty men in the party. What they had to do could\nonly be done with a fast, light force. Their strongest weapon was\nsurprise. Once that was gone their other weapons wouldn't hold out for\nseconds against the city guns. Everyone looked uncomfortable in the fur\nand leather wrappings, and some of the men had loosened them to cool\noff.\n\n\"Wrap up,\" Jason ordered. \"None of you have been this close to the\nperimeter before and you don't understand how deadly it is here. Naxa is\nkeeping the larger animals away and you all can handle the smaller\nones. That isn't the danger. Every thorn is poisoned, and even the\nblades of grass carry a deadly sting. Watch out for insects of any kind\nand once we start moving breathe only through the wet cloths.\"\n\n\"He's right,\" Naxa snorted. \"N'ver been closer'n this m'self. Death,\ndeath up by that wall. Do like 'e says.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey could only wait then, honing down already needle-sharp crossbow\nbolts, and glancing up at the slowly moving sun. Only Naxa didn't share\nthe unrest. He sat, eyes unfocused, feeling the movement of animal life\nin the jungle around them.\n\n\"On the way,\" he said. \"Biggest thing I 'ver heard. Not a beast 'tween\nhere and the mountains, ain't howlin' 'is lungs out, runnin' towards the\ncity.\"\n\nJason was aware of part of it. A tension in the air and a wave of\nintensified anger and hatred. It would work, he knew, if they could only\nkeep the attack confined to a small area. The talkers had seemed sure of\nit. They had stalked out quietly that morning, a thin line of ragged\nmen, moving out in a mental sweep that would round up the Pyrran life\nand send it charging against the city.\n\n\"They hit!\" Naxa said suddenly.\n\nThe men were on their feet now, staring in the direction of the city.\nJason had felt the twist as the attack had been driven home, and knew\nthat this was it. There was the sound of shots and a heavy booming far\naway. Thin streamers of smoke began to blow above the treetops.\n\n\"Let's get into position,\" Rhes said.\n\nAround them the jungle howled with an echo of hatred. The half-sentient\nplants writhed and the air was thick with small flying things. Naxa\nsweated and mumbled as he turned back the animals that crashed towards\nthem. By the time they reached the last screen of foliage before the\nburned-out area, they had lost four men. One had been stung by an\ninsect, Jason got the medikit to him in time, but he was so sick he had\nto turn back. The other three were bitten or scratched and treatment\ncame too late. Their swollen, twisted bodies were left behind on the\ntrail.\n\n\"Dam' beasts hurt m'head,\" Naxa muttered. \"When we go in?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" Rhes said. \"We wait for the signal.\"\n\nOne of the men carried the radio. He sat it down carefully, then threw\nthe aerial over a branch. The set was shielded so no radiation leaked\nout to give them away. It was turned on, but only a hiss of atmospheric\nstatic came from the speaker.\n\n\"We could have timed it--\" Rhes said.\n\n\"No we couldn't,\" Jason told him. \"Not accurately. We want to hit that\nwall at the height of the attack, when our chances are best. Even if\nthey hear the message it won't mean a thing to them inside. And a few\nminutes later it won't matter.\"\n\nThe sound from the speaker changed. A voice spoke a short sentence, then\ncut off.\n\n\"_Bring me three barrels of flour._\"\n\n\"Let's go,\" Rhes urged as he started forward.\n\n\"Wait,\" Jason said, taking him by the arm. \"I'm timing the\nflame-thrower. It's due in ... _there_!\" A blast of fire sprayed the\nground, then turned off. \"We have four minutes to the next one--we hit\nthe long period!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey ran, stumbling in the soft ashes, tripping over charred bones and\nrusted metal. Two men grabbed Jason under the arm and half-carried him\nacross the ground. It hadn't been planned that way, but it saved\nprecious seconds. They dropped him against the wall and he fumbled out\nthe bombs he had made. The charges from Krannon's gun, taken when he was\nkilled, had been hooked together with a firing circuit. All the moves\nhad been rehearsed carefully and they went smoothly now.\n\nJason had picked the metal wall as being the best spot to break in. It\noffered the most resistance to the native life, so the chances were it\nwouldn't be reinforced with sandbags or fill, the way other parts of the\nwall were. If he was wrong, they were all dead.\n\nThe first men had slapped their wads of sticky congealed sap against the\nwall. Jason pressed the charges into them and they stuck, a roughly\nrectangular pattern as high as a man. While he did this the detonating\nwire was run out to its length and the raiders pressed back against the\nbase of the wall. Jason stumbled through the ashes to the detonator,\nfell on it and pressed the switch at the same time.\n\nBehind him a thundering bang shook the wall and red flame burst out.\nRhes was the first one there, pulling at the twisted and smoking metal\nwith his gloved hands. Others grabbed on and bent the jagged pieces\naside. The hole was filled with smoke and nothing was visible through\nit. Jason dived into the opening, rolled on a heap of rubble and smacked\ninto something solid. When he blinked the smoke from his eyes he looked\naround him.\n\nHe was inside the city.\n\nThe others poured through now, picking him up as they charged in so he\nwouldn't be trampled underfoot. Someone spotted the spaceship and they\nran that way.\n\nA man ran around the corner of a building towards them. His Pyrran\nreflexes sent him springing into the safety of a doorway the same moment\nhe saw the invaders. But they were Pyrrans, too. The man slumped slowly\nback onto the street, three metal bolts sticking out of his body. They\nran on without stopping, running between the low storehouses. The ship\nstood ahead.\n\nSomeone had reached it ahead of them, they could see the outer hatch\nslowly grinding shut. A hail of bolts from the bows crashed into it with\nno effect.\n\n\"Keep going!\" Jason shouted. \"Get next to the hull before he reaches the\nguns.\"\n\nThis time three men didn't make it. The rest of them were under the\nbelly of the ship when every gun let go at once. Most of them were\naimed away from the ship, still the scream of shells and electric\ndischarges was ear-shattering. The three men still in the open dissolved\nunder the fire. Whoever was inside the ship had hit all the gun trips at\nonce, both to knock out the attackers and summon aid. He would be on the\nscreen now, calling for help. Their time was running out.\n\nJason reached up and tried to open the hatch, while the others watched.\nIt was locked from the inside. One of the men brushed him aside and\npulled at the inset handle. It broke off in his hand but the hatch\nremained closed.\n\nThe big guns had stopped now and they could hear again.\n\n\"Did anyone get the gun from that dead man?\" he asked. \"It would blow\nthis thing open.\"\n\n\"No,\" Rhes said, \"we didn't stop.\"\n\nBefore the words were out of his mouth two men were running back towards\nthe buildings, angling away from each other. The ship's guns roared\nagain, a string of explosions cut across one man. Before they could\nchange direction and find the other man he had reached the buildings.\n\nHe returned quickly, darting into the open to throw the gun to them.\nBefore he could dive back to safety the shells caught him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJason grabbed up the gun as it skidded almost to his feet. They heard\nthe sound of wide-open truck turbines screaming towards them as he\nblasted the lock. The mechanism sighed and the hatch sagged open. They\nwere all through the air lock before the first truck appeared. Naxa\nstayed behind with the gun, to hold the lock until they could take the\ncontrol room.\n\nEveryone climbed faster than Jason, once he had pointed them the way, so\nthe battle was over when he got there. The single city Pyrran looked\nlike a pin-cushion. One of the techs had found the gun controls and was\nshooting wildly, the sheer quantity of his fire driving the trucks back.\n\n\"Someone get on the radio and tell the talkers to call the attack off,\"\nJason said. He found the communications screen and snapped it on. Kerk's\nwide-eyed face stared at him from the screen.\n\n\"_You!_\" Kerk said, breathing the word like a curse.\n\n\"Yes, it's me,\" Jason answered. He talked without looking up, while his\nhands were busy at the control board. \"Listen to me, Kerk--and don't\ndoubt anything I say. I may not know how to fly one of these ships, but\nI do know how to blow them up. Do you hear that sound?\" He flipped over\na switch and the faraway whine of a pump droned faintly. \"That's the\nmain fuel pump. If I let it run--which I won't right now--it could\nquickly fill the drive chamber with raw fuel. Pour in so much that it\nwould run out of the stern tubes. Then what do you think would happen to\nyour one and only spacer if I pressed the firing button? I'm not asking\nyou what would happen to me, since you don't care--but you need this\nship the way you need life itself.\"\n\nThere was only silence in the cabin now, the men who had won the ship\nturned to face him. Kerk's voice grated loudly through the room.\n\n\"What do you want, Jason--what are you trying to do? Why did you lead\nthose animals in here ...\" His voice cracked and broke as anger choked\nhim and spilled over.\n\n\"Watch your tongue, Kerk,\" Jason said with soft menace. \"These _men_ you\nare talking about are the only ones on Pyrrus who have a spaceship. If\nyou want them to share it with you, you had better learn to talk nicely.\nNow come over here at once--and bring Brucco and Meta.\" Jason looked at\nthe older man's florid and swollen face and felt a measure of sympathy.\n\"Don't look so unhappy, it's not the end of the world. In fact, it might\nbe the beginning of one. And another thing, leave this channel open when\nyou go. Have it hooked into every screen in the city so everyone can see\nwhat happens here. Make sure it's taped too, for replay.\"\n\nKerk started to say something, but changed his mind before he did. He\nleft the screen, but the set stayed alive. Carrying the scene in the\ncontrol room to the entire city.\n\n\n\n\nXXVII.\n\n\nThe fight was over. It had ended so quickly the fact hadn't really sunk\nin yet. Rhes rubbed his hand against the gleaming metal of the control\nconsole, letting the reality of touch convince him. The other men milled\nabout, looking out through the viewscreens or soaking in the mechanical\nstrangeness of the room.\n\nJason was physically exhausted, but he couldn't let it show. He opened\nthe pilot's medbox and dug through it until he found the stimulants.\nThree of the little gold pills washed the fatigue from his body, and he\ncould think clearly again.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" he shouted. \"The fight's not over yet. They'll try\nanything to take this ship back and we have to be ready. I want one of\nthe techs to go over these boards until he finds the lock controls. Make\nsure all the air locks and ports are sealed. Send men to check them if\nnecessary. Turn on all the screens to scan in every direction, so no one\ncan get near the ship. We'll need a guard in the engine room, my control\ncould be cut if they broke in there. And there had better be a\nroom-by-room search of the ship, in case someone else is locked in with\nus.\"\n\nThe men had something to do now and felt relieved. Rhes split them up\ninto groups and set them to work. Jason stayed at the controls, his hand\nnext to the pump switch. The battle wasn't over yet.\n\n\"There's a truck coming,\" Rhes called, \"going slow.\"\n\n\"Should I blast it?\" the man at the gun controls asked.\n\n\"Hold your fire,\" Jason said, \"until we can see who it is. If it's the\npeople I sent for, let them through.\"\n\nAs the truck came on slowly, the gunner tracked it with his sights.\nThere was a driver and three passengers. Jason waited until he was\npositive who they were.\n\n\"Those are the ones,\" he said. \"Stop them at the lock, Rhes, make them\ncome in one at a time. Take their guns as they enter, then strip them of\n_all_ their equipment. There is no way of telling what could be a\nconcealed weapon. Be specially careful of Brucco--he's the thin one with\na face like an ax edge--make sure you strip him clean. He's a specialist\nin weapons and survival. And bring the driver too, we don't want him\nreporting back about the broken air lock or the state of our guns.\"\n\nWaiting was hard. His hand stayed next to the pump switch, even though\nhe knew he could never use it. Just as long as the others thought he\nwould.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were stampings and muttered curses in the corridor; the prisoners\nwere pushed in. Jason had one look at their deadly expressions and\nclenched fists before he called to Rhes.\n\n\"Keep them against the wall and watch them. Bowmen keep your weapons\nup.\" He looked at the people who had once been his friends and who now\nswam in hatred for him. Meta, Kerk, Brucco. The driver was Skop, the man\nKerk had once appointed to guard him. He looked ready to explode now\nthat the roles had been reversed.\n\n\"Pay close attention,\" Jason said, \"because your lives depend upon it.\nKeep your backs to the wall and don't attempt to come any closer to me\nthan you are now. If you do, you will be shot instantly. If we were\nalone, any one of you could undoubtedly reach me before I threw this\nswitch. But we're not. You have Pyrran reflexes and muscles--but so do\nthe bowmen. Don't gamble. Because it won't be a gamble. It will be\nsuicide. I'm telling you this for your own protection. So we can talk\npeacefully without one of you losing his temper and suddenly getting\nshot. _There is no way out of this._ You are going to be forced to\nlisten to everything I say. You can't escape or kill me. The war is\nover.\"\n\n\"And we lost--and all because of you ... you _traitor_!\" Meta snarled.\n\n\"Wrong on both counts,\" Jason said blandly. \"I'm not a traitor because I\nowe my allegiance to all men on this planet, both inside the perimeter\nand out. I never pretended differently. As to losing--why you haven't\nlost anything. In fact you've won. Won your war against this planet, if\nyou will only hear me out.\" He turned to Rhes, who was frowning in angry\npuzzlement. \"Of course your people have won also, Rhes. No more war with\nthe city, you'll get medicine, off-planet contact--everything you want.\"\n\n\"Pardon me for being cynical,\" Rhes said, \"but you're promising the best\nof all possible worlds for everyone. That will be a little hard to\ndeliver when our interests are opposed so.\"\n\n\"You strike through to the heart of the matter,\" Jason said. \"Thank you.\nThis mess will be settled by seeing that everyone's interests are not\nopposed. Peace between the city and farms, with an end to the useless\nwar you have been fighting. Peace between mankind and the Pyrran life\nforms--because that particular war is at the bottom of all your\ntroubles.\"\n\n\"The man's mad,\" Kerk said.\n\n\"Perhaps. You'll judge that after you hear me out. I'm going to tell you\nthe history of this planet, because that is where both the trouble and\nthe solution lie.\n\n\"When the settlers landed on Pyrrus three hundred years ago they missed\nthe one important thing about this planet, the factor that makes it\ndifferent from any other planet in the galaxy. They can't be blamed for\nthe oversight, they had enough other things to worry about. The gravity\nwas about the only thing familiar to them, the rest of the environment\nwas a shocking change from the climate-controlled industrial world they\nhad left. Storms, vulcanism, floods, earthquakes--it was enough to drive\nthem insane, and I'm sure many of them did go mad. The animal and insect\nlife was a constant annoyance, nothing at all like the few harmless and\nprotected species they had known. I'm sure they never realized that the\nPyrran life was telepathic as well--\"\n\n\"That again!\" Brucco snapped. \"True or not, it is of no importance. I\nwas tempted to agree with your theory of psionic-controlled attack on\nus, but the deadly fiasco you staged proved that theory wrong.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" Jason answered. \"I was completely mistaken when I thought\nsome outside agency directed the attack on the city with psionic\ncontrol. It seemed a logical theory at the time and the evidence pointed\nthat way. The expedition to the island _was_ a deadly fiasco--only don't\nforget that attack was the direct opposite of what I wanted to have\ndone. If I had gone into the cave myself none of the deaths would have\nbeen necessary. I think it would have been discovered that the plant\ncreatures were nothing more than an advanced life form with unusual psi\nability. They simply resonated strongly to the psionic attack on the\ncity. I had the idea backwards thinking they instigated the battle.\nWe'll never know the truth, though, because they are destroyed. But\ntheir deaths did prove one thing. It allows us to find the real\nculprits, the creatures who are leading, directing and inspiring the war\nagainst the city.\"\n\n\"_Who?_\" Kerk breathed the question, rather than spoke it.\n\n\"Why _you_ of course,\" Jason told him. \"Not you alone, but all of your\npeople in the city. Perhaps you don't like this war. However you are\nresponsible for it, and keep it going.\"\n\nJason had to force back a smile as he looked at their dumfounded\nexpressions. He had to prove his point quickly, before even his allies\nbegan to think him insane.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Here is how it works. I said Pyrran life was telepathic--and I meant\nall life. Every single insect, plant and animal. At one time in this\nplanet's violent history these psionic mutations proved to be survival\ntypes. They existed when other species died, and in the end I'm sure\nthey co-operated in wiping out the last survivors of the non-psi\nstrains. Co-operation is the key word here. Because while they still\ncompeted against each other under normal conditions, they worked\ntogether against anything that threatened them as a whole. When a\nnatural upheaval or a tidal wave threatened them, they fled from it in\nharmony.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"You can see a milder form of this same behavior on any planet that is\nsubject to forest fires. But here, mutual survival was carried to an\nextreme because of the violent conditions. Perhaps some of the life\nforms even developed precognition like the human quakemen. With this\nadvance warning the larger beasts fled. The smaller ones developed\nseeds, or burrs or eggs, that could be carried to safety by the wind or\nin the animals' fur, thus insuring racial survival. I know this is true,\nbecause I watched it myself when we were escaping a quake.\"\n\n\"Admitted--all your points admitted,\" Brucco shouted. \"But what does it\nhave to do with _us_? So all the animals run away together, what does\nthat have to do with the war?\"\n\n\"They do more than run away together,\" Jason told him. \"They work\ntogether against any natural disaster that threatens them all. Some day\nI'm sure, ecologists will go into raptures over the complex adjustments\nthat occur here in the advent of blizzards, floods, fires and other\ndisasters. There is only one reaction we really care about now, though.\nThat's the one directed towards the city people. Don't you realize\nyet--they treat you all as another natural disaster!\n\n\"We'll never know exactly how it came about, though there is a clue in\nthat diary I found, dating from the first days on this planet. It said\nthat a forest fire seemed to have driven new species towards the\nsettlers. Those weren't new beasts at all--just old ones with new\nattitudes. Can't you just imagine how those protected, over-civilized\nsettlers acted when faced with a forest fire? They panicked of course.\nIf the settlers were in the path of the fire, the animals must have\nrushed right through their camp. Their reaction would undoubtedly have\nbeen to shoot the fleeing creatures down.\n\n\"When they did that they classified themselves as a natural disaster.\nDisasters take any form. Bipeds with guns could easily be included in\nthe category. The Pyrran animals attacked, were shot, and the war began.\nThe survivors kept attacking and informed all the life forms what the\nfight was about. The radioactivity of this planet must cause plenty of\nmutations--and the favorable, survival mutation was now one that was\ndeadly to man. I'll hazard a guess that the psi function even instigates\nmutations, some of the deadlier types are just too one-sided to have\ncome about naturally in a brief three hundred years.\n\n\"The settlers, of course, fought back, and kept their status as a\nnatural disaster intact. Through the centuries they improved their\nkilling methods, not that it did the slightest good, as you know. You\ncity people, their descendants, are heirs to this heritage of hatred.\nYou fight and are slowly being defeated. How can you possibly win\nagainst the biologic reserves of a planet that can recreate itself each\ntime to meet any new attack?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSilence followed Jason's words. Kerk and Meta stood white-faced as the\nimpact of the disclosure sunk in. Brucco mumbled and checked points off\non his fingers, searching for weak spots in the chain of reason. The\nfourth city Pyrran, Skop, ignored all these foolish words that he\ncouldn't understand--or want to understand--and would have killed Jason\nin an instant if there had been the slightest chance of success.\n\nIt was Rhes who broke the silence. His quick mind had taken in the\nfactors and sorted them out. \"There's one thing wrong,\" he said. \"What\nabout us? We live on the surface of Pyrrus without perimeters or guns.\nWhy aren't we attacked as well? We're human, descended from the same\npeople as the junkmen.\"\n\n\"You're not attacked,\" Jason told him, \"because you don't identify\nyourself as a natural disaster. Animals can live on the slopes of a\ndormant volcano, fighting and dying in natural competition. But they'll\nflee together when the volcano erupts. That eruption is what makes the\nmountain a natural disaster. In the case of human beings, it is their\nthoughts that identify them as life form or disaster. Mountain or\nvolcano. In the city everyone radiates suspicion and death. They enjoy\nkilling, thinking about killing, and planning for killing. This is\nnatural selection, too, you realize. These are the survival traits that\nwork best in the city. Outside the city men think differently. If they\nare threatened individually, they fight, as will any other creature.\nUnder more general survival threats they co-operate completely with the\nrules for universal survival that the city people break.\"\n\n\"How did it begin--this separation, I mean, between the two groups?\"\nRhes asked.\n\n\"We'll probably never know,\" Jason said. \"I think your people must have\noriginally been farmers, or psionic sensitives who were not with the\nothers during some natural disaster. They would, of course, act\ncorrectly by Pyrran standards, and survive. This would cause a\ndifference of opinion with the city people who saw killing as the\nanswer. It's obvious, whatever the reason, that two separate communities\nwere established early, and soon separated except for the limited amount\nof barter that benefited both.\"\n\n\"I still can't believe it,\" Kerk mumbled. \"It makes a terrible kind of\ntruth, every step of the way, but I still find it hard to accept. There\n_must_ be another explanation.\"\n\nJason shook his head slowly. \"None. This is the only one that works.\nWe've eliminated the other ones, remember? I can't blame you for finding\nit hard to believe, since it is in direct opposition to everything\nyou've understood to be true in the past. It's like altering a natural\nlaw. As if I gave you proof that gravity didn't really exist, that it\nwas a force altogether different from the immutable one we know, one you\ncould get around when you understood how. You'd want more proof than\nwords. Probably want to see someone walking on air.\"\n\n\"Which isn't such a bad idea at that,\" he added, turning to Naxa. \"Do\nyou hear any animals around the ship now? Not the ones you're used to,\nbut the mutated, violent kind that live only to attack the city.\"\n\n\"Place's crawling with 'em,\" Naxa said, \"just lookin' for somethin'\nt'kill.\"\n\n\"Could you capture one?\" Jason asked. \"Without getting yourself killed,\nI mean.\"\n\nNaxa snorted contempt as he turned to leave. \"Beast's not born yet,\nthat'll hurt me.\"\n\nThey stood quietly, each one wrapped tightly around by his own thoughts,\nwhile they waited for Naxa to return. Jason had nothing more to say. He\nwould do one more thing to try and convince them of the facts, after\nthat it would be up to each of them to reach a conclusion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe talker returned quickly with a stingwing, tied by one leg to a\nlength of leather. It flapped and shrieked as he carried it in.\n\n\"In the middle of the room, away from everybody,\" Jason told him. \"Can\nyou get that beast to sit on something and not flap around?\"\n\n\"My hand good enough?\" he asked, flipping the creature up so it clung to\nthe back of his gauntlet. \"That's how I caught it.\"\n\n\"Does anyone doubt that this is a real stingwing?\" Jason asked. \"I want\nto make sure you all believe there is no trickery here.\"\n\n\"The thing is real,\" Brucco said. \"I can smell the poison in the\nwing-claws from here.\" He pointed to the dark marks on the leather where\nthe liquid had dripped. \"If that eats through the gloves, he's a dead\nman.\"\n\n\"Then we agree it's real,\" Jason said. \"Real and deadly, and the only\ntest of the theory will be if you people from the city can approach it\nlike Naxa here.\"\n\nThey drew back automatically when he said it. Because they knew that\nstingwing was synonymous with death. Past, present and future. You don't\nchange a natural law. Meta spoke for all of them.\n\n\"We ... can't. This man lives in the jungle, like an animal himself.\nSomehow he's learned to get near them. But you can't expect us to.\"\n\nJason spoke quickly, before the talker could react to the insult. \"Of\ncourse I expect you to. That's the whole idea. If you don't hate the\nbeast and expect it to attack you--why it won't. Think of it as a\ncreature from a different planet, something harmless.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" she said. \"It's a _stingwing_!\"\n\nAs they talked Brucco stepped forward, his eyes fixed steadily on the\ncreature perched on the glove. Jason signaled the bowmen to hold their\nfire. Brucco stopped at a safe distance and kept looking steadily at the\nstingwing. It rustled its leathery wings uneasily and hissed. A drop of\npoison formed at the tip of each great poison claw on its wings. The\ncontrol room was filled with a deadly silence.\n\nSlowly he raised his hand. Carefully putting it out, over the animal.\nThe hand dropped a little, rubbed the stingwing's head once, then fell\nback to his side. The animal did nothing except stir slightly under the\ntouch.\n\nThere was a concerted sigh, as those who had been unknowingly holding\ntheir breath breathed again.\n\n\"How did you do it?\" Meta asked in a hushed voice.\n\n\"Hm-m-m, what?\" Brucco said, apparently snapping out of a daze. \"Oh,\ntouching the thing. Simple, really. I just pretended it was one of the\ntraining aids I use, a realistic and harmless duplicate. I kept my mind\non that single thought and it worked.\" He looked down at his hand, then\nback to the stingwing. His voice quieter now, as if he spoke from a\ndistance. \"It's not a training aid you know. It's real. Deadly. The\noff-worlder is right. He's right about everything he said.\"\n\nWith Brucco's success as an example, Kerk came close to the animal. He\nwalked stiffly, as if on the way to his execution, and runnels of sweat\npoured down his rigid face. But he believed and kept his thoughts\ndirected away from the stingwing and he could touch it unharmed.\n\nMeta tried but couldn't fight down the horror it raised when she came\nclose. \"I am trying,\" she said, \"and I do believe you now--but I just\ncan't do it.\"\n\nSkop screamed when they all looked at him, shouted it was all a trick,\nand had to be clubbed unconscious when he attacked the bowmen.\n\nUnderstanding had come to Pyrrus.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII.\n\n\n\"What do we do now?\" Meta asked. Her voice was troubled, questioning.\nShe voiced the thoughts of all the Pyrrans in the room, and the\nthousands who watched in their screens.\n\n\"What will we do?\" They turned to Jason, waiting for an answer. For the\nmoment their differences were forgotten. The people from the city were\nstaring expectantly at him, as were the crossbowmen with half-lowered\nweapons. This stranger had confused and changed the old world they had\nknown, and presented them with a newer and stranger one, with alien\nproblems.\n\n\"Hold on,\" he said, raising his hand. \"I'm no doctor of social ills. I'm\nnot going to try and cure this planet full of muscle-bound\nsharpshooters. I've just squeezed through up to now, and by the law of\naverages I should be ten times dead.\"\n\n\"Even if all you say is true, Jason,\" Meta said, \"you are still the only\nperson who can help us. What will the future be like?\"\n\nSuddenly weary, Jason slumped into the pilot's chair. He glanced around\nat the circle of people. They seemed sincere. None of them even appeared\nto have noticed that he no longer had his hand on the pump switch. For\nthe moment at least, the war between city and farm was forgotten.\n\n\"I'll give you my conclusions,\" Jason said, twisting in the chair,\ntrying to find a comfortable position for his aching bones. \"I've been\ndoing a lot of thinking the last day or two, searching for the answer.\nThe very first thing I realized, was that the perfect and logical\nsolution wouldn't do at all. I'm afraid the old ideal of the lion lying\ndown with the lamb doesn't work out in practice. About all it does is\nmake a fast lunch for the lion. Ideally, now that you all know the real\ncauses of your trouble, you should tear down the perimeter and have the\ncity and forest people mingle in brotherly love. Makes just as pretty a\npicture as the one of lion and lamb. And would undoubtedly have the same\nresult. Someone would remember how really filthy the grubbers are, or\nhow stupid junkmen can be, and there would be a fresh corpse cooling.\nThe fight would spread and the victors would be eaten by the wildlife\nthat swarmed over the undefended perimeter. No, the answer isn't that\neasy.\"\n\nAs the Pyrrans listened to him they realized where they were, and\nglanced around uneasily. The guards raised their crossbows again, and\nthe prisoners stepped back to the wall and looked surly.\n\n\"See what I mean?\" Jason asked. \"Didn't take long did it?\" They all\nlooked a little sheepish at their unthinking reactions.\n\n\"If we're going to find a decent plan for the future, we'll have to\ntake inertia into consideration. Mental inertia for one. Just because\nyou know a thing is true in theory, doesn't make it true in fact. The\nbarbaric religions of primitive worlds hold not a germ of scientific\nfact, though they claim to explain all. Yet if one of these savages has\nall the logical ground for his beliefs taken away--he doesn't stop\nbelieving. He then calls his mistaken beliefs 'faith' because he knows\nthey are right. And he knows they are right because he has faith. This\nis an unbreakable circle of false logic that can't be touched. In\nreality, it is plain mental inertia. A case of thinking 'what always\nwas' will also 'always be.' And not wanting to blast the thinking\npatterns out of the old rut.\n\n\"Mental inertia alone is not going to cause trouble--there is cultural\ninertia, too. Some of you in this room believe my conclusions and would\nlike to change. But will all your people change? The unthinking ones,\nthe habit-ridden, reflex-formed people who _know_ what is now, will\nalways be. They'll act like a drag on whatever plans you make, whatever\nattempts you undertake to progress with the new knowledge you have.\"\n\n\"Then it's useless--there's no hope for our world?\" Rhes asked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I didn't say that,\" Jason answered. \"I merely mean that your troubles\nwon't end by throwing some kind of mental switch. I see three courses\nopen for the future, and the chances are that all three will be going on\nat the same time.\n\n\"First--and best--will be the rejoining of city and farm Pyrrans into\nthe single human group they came from. Each is incomplete now, and has\nsomething the other one needs. In the city here you have science and\ncontact with the rest of the galaxy. You also have a deadly war. Out\nthere in the jungle, your first cousins live at peace with the world,\nbut lack medicine and the other benefits of scientific knowledge, as\nwell as any kind of cultural contact with the rest of mankind. You'll\nboth have to join together and benefit from the exchange. At the same\ntime you'll have to forget the superstitious hatred you have of each\nother. This will only be done outside of the city, away from the war.\nEvery one of you who is capable should go out voluntarily, bringing some\nfraction of the knowledge that needs sharing. You won't be harmed if you\ngo in good faith. And you will learn how to live _with_ this planet,\nrather than against it. Eventually you'll have civilized communities\nthat won't be either 'grubber' or 'junkman.' They'll be Pyrran.\"\n\n\"But what about our city here?\" Kerk asked.\n\n\"It'll stay right here--and probably won't change in the slightest. In\nthe beginning you'll need your perimeter and defenses to stay alive,\nwhile the people are leaving. And after that it will keep going because\nthere are going to be any number of people here who you won't convince.\nThey'll stay and fight and eventually die. Perhaps you will be able to\ndo a better job in educating their children. What the eventual end of\nthe city will be, I have no idea.\"\n\nThey were silent as they thought about the future. On the floor Skop\ngroaned but did not move. \"Those are two ways,\" Meta said. \"What is the\nthird?\"\n\n\"The third possibility is my own pet scheme,\" Jason smiled. \"And I hope\nI can find enough people to go along with me. I'm going to take my money\nand spend it all on outfitting the best and most modern spacer, with\nevery weapon and piece of scientific equipment I can get my hands on.\nThen I'm going to ask for Pyrran volunteers to go with me.\"\n\n\"What in the world for?\" Meta frowned.\n\n\"Not for charity, I expect to make my investment back, and more. You\nsee, after these past few months, I can't possibly return to my old\noccupation. Not only do I have enough money now to make it a waste of\ntime, but I think it would be an unending bore. One thing about\nPyrrus--if you live--is that it spoils you for the quieter places. So\nI'd like to take this ship that I mentioned and go into the business of\nopening up new worlds. There are thousands of planets where men would\nlike to settle, only getting a foothold on them is too rough or rugged\nfor the usual settlers. Can you imagine a planet a Pyrran couldn't lick\nafter the training you've had here? And enjoy doing it?\n\n\"There would be more than pleasure involved, though. In the city your\nlives have been geared for continual deadly warfare. Now you're faced\nwith the choice of a fairly peaceful future, or staying in the city to\nfight an unnecessary and foolish war. I offer the third alternative of\nthe occupation you know best, that would let you accomplish something\nconstructive at the same time.\n\n\"Those are the choices. Whatever you decide is up to each of you\npersonally.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore anyone could answer, livid pain circled Jason's throat. Skop had\nregained consciousness and surged up from the floor. He pulled Jason\nfrom the chair with a single motion, holding him by the neck, throttling\nhim.\n\n\"Kerk! Meta!\" Skop shouted hoarsely. \"Grab guns! Open the locks--our\npeople'll be here, kill the grubbers and their lies!\"\n\nJason tore at the fingers that were choking the life out of him, but it\nwas like pulling at bent steel bars. He couldn't talk and the blood\nhammered in his ears.\n\nMeta hurtled forward like an uncoiled spring and the crossbows twanged.\nOne bolt caught her in the leg, the other transfixed her upper arm. But\nshe had been shot as she jumped and her inertia carried her across the\nroom, to her fellow Pyrran and the dying off-worlder.\n\nShe raised her good arm and chopped down with the edge of her hand.\n\nIt caught Skop a hard blow on the biceps and his arm jumped\nspasmodically, his hand leaping from Jason's throat.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" he shouted in strange terror to the wounded girl\nwho fell against him. He pushed her away, still clutching Jason with his\nother hand. She didn't answer. Instead she chopped again, hard and true,\nthe edge of her hand catching Skop across the windpipe, crushing it. He\ndropped Jason and fell to the floor, retching and gasping.\n\nJason watched the end through a haze, barely conscious.\n\nSkop struggled to his feet, turned pain-filled eyes to his friends.\n\n\"You're wrong,\" Kerk said. \"Don't do it.\"\n\nThe sound the wounded man made was more animal than human. When he dived\ntowards the guns on the far side of the room the crossbows twanged like\nharps of death.\n\nWhen Brucco went over to help Meta no one interfered. Jason gasped air\nback into his lungs, breathing in life. The watching glass eye of the\nviewer carried the scene to everyone in the city.\n\n\"Thanks, Meta ... for understanding ... as well as helping.\" Jason had\nto force the words out.\n\n\"Skop was wrong and you were right, Jason,\" she said. Her voice broke\nfor a second as Brucco snapped off the feathered end of the steel bolt\nwith his fingers, and pulled the shaft out of her arm. \"I can't stay in\nthe city, only people who feel as Skop did will be able to do that. And\nI'm afraid I can't go into the forest--you saw what luck I had with the\nstingwing. If it's all right I'd like to come with you. I'd like to very\nmuch.\"\n\nIt hurt when he talked so Jason could only smile, but she knew what he\nmeant.\n\nKerk looked down in unhappiness at the body of the dead man. \"He was\nwrong--but I know how he felt. I can't leave the city, not yet. Someone\nwill have to keep things in hand while the changes are taking place.\nYour ship is a good idea, Jason, you'll have no shortage of volunteers.\nThough I doubt if you'll get Brucco to go with you.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Brucco snapped, not looking up from the compression\nbandage he was tying. \"There's enough to do right here on Pyrrus. The\nanimal life, quite a study to be made, probably have every ecologist in\nthe galaxy visiting here.\"\n\nKerk walked slowly to the screen overlooking the city. No one attempted\nto stop him. He looked out at the buildings, the smoke still curling up\nfrom the perimeter, and the limitless sweep of green jungle beyond.\n\n\"You've changed it all, Jason,\" he said. \"We can't see it now, but\nPyrrus will never be the way it was before you came. For better or\nworse.\"\n\n\"Better,\" Jason croaked, and rubbed his aching throat. \"Now get together\nand end this war so people will really believe it.\"\n\nRhes turned and after an instant's hesitation, extended his hand to\nKerk. The gray-haired Pyrran felt the same repugnance himself about\ntouching a grubber.\n\nThey shook hands then because they were both strong men.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ January,\n    February and March 1960.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
