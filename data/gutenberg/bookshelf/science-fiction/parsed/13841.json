Looking down from the balcony he watched\nthe white sun rise slowly, lighting the valleys and stalk forests\nbelow, the dark mountains behind.  The only sound was that of\ntransplanted birds in the distance, seeming unnatural in this\naltogether alien landscape.  He heard his name called from within, but\ndid not answer.  Elonna came and stood in the glass doorway behind him,\nwrapped in a blanket.\n\n\"What's the matter, Eric?\"  He did not answer but only shook his head\nwithout turning.  She stepped out onto the balcony beside him, opened\nthe blanket with her arms and wrapped it about his shoulders.  Her skin\nfelt warm against him, but could not displace the emptiness and anxiety\nhe felt.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" she asked again, curling up against his chest.\n\n\"I don't know.  It's too quiet.\"  The girl turned her face to look out\ninto the wind, her long hair flowing behind.  She looked out at the\nsun, warm and sleepy-eyed, then drew back from him with a start.\n\n\"Eric, look!\"  Three black specks had just cleared the horizon, and\nwere moving swiftly toward them.  They flew in tight V formation, but\ntheir shapes could not yet be distinguished.\n\n\"Oh, damn.  Elonna, get inside, down into the shelter.  I'm going to\ntry to contact the city.\"\n\nShe hurried inside.  He looked back then moved to follow, but too late.\n A shaft of yellow light shot down from one of the ships, now nearly\noverhead, and he slumped to the balcony floor.  Then they were gone.\n\nShe cried out and rushed and knelt beside him, lifting his shoulders.\n\"Eric, no! Don't leave me here.\"  She wept and put his head to her neck\nand rocked him back and forth, but he only lay there unmoving.\n\nFrom behind the mountains came a blinding flash, followed after several\nhushed breaths by a deep rumbling in the distance.  Then all was quiet\nand the city, too, was gone.  She knelt holding him still, trying to\nremember what he said to do if this happened, but for a time could only\ncry. She heard the sound of smaller ships approaching but it did not\nregister.  Suddenly she knew she was in danger and must act.\n\nShe ran inside, quickly zipped into a coverall, grabbed a flask of\nwater as she passed out of the room.  She ran down the stairs, was out\nthe door and flying toward the forest while a part of her was still on\nthe balcony.\n\nShe reached the first stubble-shoots, four to six feet high, their blue\nbranches like thick hair at an angle toward the sun.  Brushing past\nthem, she was just entering the cover of the trees when a small\ntroop-deploying ship landed amidst the cluster of houses from which she\nhad fled.  Screams broke out but they were cut short, one by one.  Her\neyes welled with tears and she stumbled many times but kept going.\n\nAfter what seemed an eternity she came upon the narrow path, branching\nleft and gradually rising toward an outlying spur of the hills.  But by\nnow she could go no further.  She had just strength and wits enough\nleft to move a short way off it and collapse into a long dry rill,\noverhung with bushes.  There for a time, dizziness and fatigue pinned\nher.  She was too physically spent to feel much sorrow, but at\nintervals the knowledge of her husband's death came back to her like a\nhollow blow in places she could not defend.  At last grief wholly\novercame her.\n\n\"Oh, Eric.  What am I going to do without you?\"  She lay there weeping.\n Then slowly, like a memory, his words began to come back to her.\n\n\"If you get to the deep woods and I still haven't come, you've got to\nhide.\"  I'M HIDDEN ERIC.  \"But that won't do for long.  They'll be out\nwith heat sensors, so you've got to get to the graves.\"  She started to\nrise, then fell back.  ERIC, I CAN'T.  \"You must.\"\n\nShe staggered to her feet, found the path, went forward and began\nlooking for the cluster of gray stones which marked the turnoff.  She\nfound it just as she was ready to quit.\n\nLeaving the path once more, she picked her way through vaguely familiar\nlandmarks till she came to two bare oblong mounds of earth.  THEY DO\nLOOK LIKE GRAVES.  She fumbled about the edge of one till she found the\nhandle.  It took all her strength to lift it, and the thick red earth\non top did not move.  She slid her way into the opening and lay in the\nshallow hole, the lid thudding to above her.\n\nShe felt for the dead-blanket, covered the length of her body with it\nand shivered in the darkness.  The cutting whir of a search-ship\noverhead sounded dully around her.  She clutched together like a child,\nhardly daring to breathe.  But the ship passed over and was gone.\n\nShe was alone.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe night had come and though she could not see it she could feel it.\nThe air that tricked in from the breathing hole was cold and wet,\nchilling her.  She turned and wrestled the dead-blanket from her,\nreached up and tried to push back the lid.\n\nIt would not move, and for a moment she panicked.  Then placing both\nhands together, she pushed with everything she had.  The earth above\nher buckled, cracked and gave way.  She forced her way out.  She stood\nup, brushed away the clay-like dirt, and looked around her.\n\nAll was dark and silent.  There was no moon, but through scattered\nopenings in the interlacing canopy a few stars shone dimly.  Her eyes\nalready accustomed to the dark, she worked her way slowly back to the\npath, then turned to the right.  Still there was no sound and she\nwalked, tentatively at first, and stopping to look around her many\ntimes, then with greater confidence on toward the hills.  She picked a\nlight, strong shaft from among the many that lay fallen by the way.\nIts curved length felt reassuring in her hands.  She still felt great\nloss, but no longer any fear.  The hours in the grave had not been\nwasted.\n\nThe grade became steeper, and she found she was topping the first\nshallow hill.  The way led down from it and then up again, more steeply\nthan before.  The smooth stones became larger and more numerous.\n\nAt length she felt she must rest, and sitting on a cold stone, suddenly\nrealized that for all her newfound courage, she had no clear idea where\nshe was trying to go.  Beyond vague references to 'people in the\nhills', Eric's instructions ended here.  Through chattering teeth she\nhugged her shoulders, lowered her head and tried not to cry.  ERIC.\n\nAgain she rose and looked about her, stamping her feet to try to keep\nwarm.  Nothing in sight.  Wait. . .what was that?  Either her eyes\ndeceived her or there was a pale resonance, little more than a shadow\nof light, just beyond the hill in front of her.  From where she stood\nthe path hooked left to skirt its base before finding a narrow pass\nbetween ever larger foothills.  But above and to her right came the\nsoft, inviting sheen.  Torn between fear and the need for shelter, she\nmoved cautiously a short way into the brush.\n\nThe climb was not steep, but try as she might she could not make it\nnoiselessly.  More than once she missed her footing, stumbled, and fell\nthrough thick leaves with a muted sound like walking through corn.  In\ntruth the noise of her falling was not great, and except for a short\ngasp on one occasion no sound escaped her lips.  But in that quiet of\nnight she was sure that it carried.\n\nFinally reaching the hilltop, she looked down on a slight recession, in\nthe center of which lay a small, rounded clearing.  A dim lantern was\nhung on a post at one end, seeming lost and forlorn in the wilderness.\nAll around it there was nothing to be seen except a broad, flat bench\non which a man might rest, and no sign that it was anything more than a\ntraveler's light, left to mark a trail, that would go on glowing for\nyears unattended.\n\nStill she took nothing for granted.  She approached the clearing and\nslowly, very slowly left the cover of the trees.  She made her way\nsilently to the post and examined it closely.  She heard something step\nthrough the bushes to her left and her heart was in her throat.  She\nwhirled, relaxed and nearly fainted.\n\nThe man's face and hands were black.\n\n\"Thank God,\" she managed, swooning still.  The man, perhaps fifty, clad\nin camouflaged cover-suit and jacket, remained at his distance.  When\nshe had recovered herself she saw that he regarded her kindly, but made\nno attempt to help her stand.\n\n\"What have we here?\" he said in a dry voice, with just a corner of a\nsmile.  \"Another ebony wanderer?  And in the middle of the night.  I\nwas just getting ready to leave.\"\n\n\"I guess so.\"  Now that she was no longer moving, the cold pierced her\nclothes and she shivered once more.\n\n\"Well, I guess we'd better get you out of it.  Have you strength to\nwalk?\"\n\n\"Yes.....  How do I know I can trust you?\"\n\n\"You have no choice.\"  He left the light as it was.\n\nHe led the way, and after hesitating she walked with him for several\nmiles without speaking, climbing ever higher into the dark, bony hills.\n They rested then briefly, her breath coming hard from the steep grades\nthey had already passed.  But now, leaning dizzy and pallid against a\nstone, she felt a strange reluctance to speak of her condition.  A\nharsh stubbornness had been growing inside her as they went, tightening\never harder as fatigue become unbearable.  The feeling frightened her,\nbut she kept it to herself.  Instead she tried to satisfy another doubt.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I am that which I am,\" he said.  And he gave a short, bitter laugh.\n\n\"Why are you laughing?\"\n\n\"Nothing to do with you,\" he said.  \"Just making a little joke to\nmyself.\"  She looked down at the ground beneath her feet.  \"But now you\nmust be very tired.  No need to push yourself all at once.  Sit down on\nthe ground and we'll rest.\"\n\nShe slid to the cold earth with her back against rough stone.  It was\nquiet, too quiet, and through the darkness the memories.....  She wept\nquietly.\n\n\"So softness wins out after all,\" he said flatly.  She glared at him\nangrily, but he was not looking at her.  \"Don't worry about it.\nSometimes it wins in me too.\"  He must think he's some kind of stern\nfather, she thought.  A stern, unfeeling bastard of a father.\n\nThey walked till the hills became sheer, then rested again, this time\nlooking up at a dark face frowning down on them.  \"How much further?\"\nshe asked heavily.\n\n\"Not far.\"\n\n\"Truthfully?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Can you walk a little farther?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Just give me a minute to rest.\"  He did, exactly.  They set out\nagain, skirting the rockface till they came to a gap between cliffs.\nThey followed it up and in, moving through a narrow strip with high\nwalls on either side. Finally it died into a meeting of stone.\n\n\"Where now?\" she asked between gasps.\n\n\"Nowhere.  We're here.\"\n\n\"But I don't see anything.\"  A cold fear ran through her.\n\n\"Wouldn't be much of a hiding place if you could.\"  He moved past her\nand flicked his finger between a crack in the rock.  Almost at once a\nsoft white light began to filter through a cave entrance not ten feet\nabove them, a short distance to the right.  Something like a smoky film\nwas dissolving before it.  He boosted her up to a narrow ledge that ran\nin front of it, and after a short, stepping climb she was there.  He\ncame behind her, gestured with his hand.\n\n\"Go on.  I promise I won't bite you.\"  Again, just a corner of a smile.\n\nShe entered the cave, found it warm and well lit.  A thick, transparent\ntube along one wall provided the heat.  Light came down from three very\nordinary fixtures, hung from the ceiling some twelve feet above.  This\nmain chamber, neither large nor small, ran back into a narrow arch, the\nshadows of which did not seem to go much farther.  There was a table,\nlong and low, a wooden bench and two chairs.  Several large packs,\nthree strange instrument panels stood against the far wall.  Something\ndark and small was huddled among them.  To her surprise she saw that it\nwas a child:  a small boy, dressed in blue.\n\n\"Hello,\" she said.  \"What's your name?\"  He gave no answer, but studied\nher with dark, shining eyes.\n\n\"I'm afraid you won't get much out of that one.  He's still a bit shook\nup.\"  The man put down his pack, leaned his weapon against the edge of\nthe table.  \"Found him away north this afternoon.  His mother told him\njust to run and keep running.  He did.....  You want coffee?\"\n\n\"Yes, please.\"  He returned from the back a moment later with a\nsteaming cup, and a plate of some synthesized food.  \"Thank you.\"  He\npulled a chair and sat down across from her, watching her eat.\n\n\"So what's YOUR name?\" he said at length, and the kind older man was\nsubmerged.\n\n\"Elonna Dorsett.\"\n\n\"You're not all black, are you, Elonna?\"\n\n\"No.  My grandmother was white.  Is that important?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily.\"  A pause.  \"So how many did you lose?\"\n\nShe glared at him, then softened.  \"Only one.  My husband.\"\n\nHe got up and paced, then stood squarely before her.\n\n\"So tell me this, Elonna Dorsett.  What do you plan to do about it?\"\nShe hesitated. \n\n\"Anything I can.\"  She had a strange sensation as she said the words: a\nsand castle on a beach, broken and swept away by the waves.  But maybe\nif there was a stone in its center, hard and sharp and black.....\n\n\"Well, at least you're no spy.\"  He said it matter-of-factly, as if the\nquestion had been understood between them.  \"And you've a bit of spunk.\n Not much perhaps, but a bit.\"  He winked at her halfheartedly, the\ngraying father once more.  \"You must be tired.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe led her to the second chamber, gave her a thin mat against the hard\nfloor, which he placed a short distance from his own.  Then he fetched\nthe boy out from between consoles, and set him on the mat beside her.\nHe extinguished all but a soft bluish light, and lay down himself.  He\nturned away.\n\n\"Who are you?\" she asked quietly.\n\n\"I used to be a minister.\"  Again the short, bitter laugh.  \"Now I\ndon't know who I am.  Just don't call me Moses.\"\n\nHe said no more, and they slept.\n\n\n*\n\n\n\"How could they do such a thing?\"  They sat again on opposite sides of\nthe table, drinking coffee and eating a meager breakfast.  With the\nnight passed and the boy off playing, she hoped she would find him more\ntalkative.\n\n\"What, the great white hopefuls?  Simple.  There was no one to stop\nthem.\"\n\n\"But why? when they brought us here in the first place?\"  He chewed a\nstale biscuit, and for a time did not answer.\n\n\"Don't ask me to explain the Minority Homestead Act.  It was created by\nanother government, and would take a week.\"\n\n\"But the killing---\"\n\n\"Every expansionist power needs a hate-group within its own boundaries,\nsomeone to blame for their own fears and failures.  Someone for the\nviolent but inexperienced to cut their teeth on.  Hating the Jews is no\nlonger fashionable, and there aren't enough of them here.  We were\nobvious, so they picked us instead.\"\n\n\"Surely it's not that simple.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" he said irritably.  \"We represented old fears and\nreligious prejudice, the 'mark of Cain' and all that brutal bullshit.\nWe still had money and pride when their debt-based economy crashed.....\n This is pointless; figure it out for yourself.  I don't want to know\ntheir reasons, only what I can do about it.\"  He fell silent, hard and\ncold.  She said no more.\n\nAt that moment the boy came running out of the back and climbed quickly\nonto the bench beside her.  Tears were in his eyes, and she put her arm\naround him.  He buried his head against her, peeped out at the man,\nthen buried it again.\n\n\"Look after him, will you?  I'm going out for a while.\"  The man rose,\nswitched off the shield and went to the entrance.\n\n\"Wait,\" she called after him.  \"I still don't know your name.\"\n\n\"My name is Lawrence.\"  He was gone.\n\nThe boy drew back and looked up at her, no longer frightened but now\ntired and curious.\n\n\"Well that's better.  You don't have to be afraid of me.\"  He looked at\nher and chewed his finger.  She returned his gaze and smiled.  \"What's\nyour name?\"\n\n\"Johnny Harris.\"  His leg kicked gently out over the side.  She patted\nhim on the head, then went to look for some paper.\n\nThe man went down between the high walls of the gap, coming out at the\ntwin faces of the cliffs.  Turning right, he skirted the huge southern\npromontory till he came a scree hill, rising still higher toward the\nfrozen peaks beyond.  Here, some two hundred yards further up, a four\nfoot tunnel, shaded by a boulder, led deep into the mountainside.\nStooping to enter, he walked till he was weary and stiff with a sharp\npain in his back, then walked much farther.\n\n\n*\n\n\nIt was late evening, darkening to full night.  Two men walked through\nthe opening with the shield still dissipating.  The familiar face came\nfirst, then to her dismay the woman saw that the stranger was white.\nHe studied her as they approached, with the same hard cold gleam as the\nother.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said, turning to the guerrilla.  \"She has the looks,\nbut not much grit, seemingly.  The face is much too soft.\"\n\nLawrence said nothing, hung his coat on a peg by the wall.  She half\nexpected him to draw out a hidden knife and bury it in the white man's\nback.  But the two stood side by side, and she realized that she was\nthe outsider, the one in question.  The tall, fair-haired man stood\nlooking her up and down like a slave at auction.  She got angry.\n\n\"What am I, a piece of meat?\"\n\n\"Shut up and get us some water,\" said the black man.  She turned on\nhim, furious.\n\n\"How dare you talk to me like that?  How dare you?  And if you think\nyou're going to turn me over to this Nazi---\"  She ran to the wall and\ngrabbed the laser rifle, pointed it right at him.\n\nBut the older man just laughed grimly, and the fantasy fell apart.\n\"You see what I mean?\" he said.  \"She has some grit.  Put away the\nrifle, Elonna.\"\n\n\"All right, but you get your own water.\"  He did, retiring to the back\nwhile the other placed his rifle on the table and sat down.  Elonna\nfaced him angrily.  \"You just watch how you look at me.\"  Then she\nwalked to the entrance, still unshielded, with the boy and went out.\n\nThe tall man watched her go, then turned to face his friend as he came\nout with a filled water bottle.  The guerrilla handed it to him,\nreactivated the shield and returned to the table.  They passed the\nwater back and forth between them.\n\n\"She is very beautiful, Lawrence.  But have we the right to ask her to\ndo this?\"\n\n\"We have the right to ask.  But there will be no secrets among us.  She\nwill know who we are, and fully understand the danger before we ask her\nto do anything.  There is no hurry.  I haven't fully judged her\ncharacter yet myself.  This will take time to set up on your end,\nanyway.  We may not even get the chance.\"\n\n\"I think we will, if we are patient.\"  A pause.  \"I didn't mean to\nstare at her like that.  It's just that it's hard to tell her features\nbeneath that coverall.\"\n\n\"I know that, Morgan.  Still, it's a fine couple of gentlemen we've\nbecome.  Myself especially, for having thought of it.  But if we could\neliminate Hunter.....\"\n\n\"No, I think it's a good plan, as far as it goes.  And if we've lost a\nbit of humanity, it only helps us understand their mentality.  I was\nthere when they drafted the plans for these raids.  I've also had a\nglimpse of what they've got in store for the Laurian socialists.  The\nonly way to stop them, or at least hinder them until the rest of the\nquadrant wakes up, sees these bastards for what they are and sends out\nreal armies to stop them, is to strike at all points, especially the\ntop, and be just as cold and unfeeling as they are.\"\n\nThe other said nothing, stared soberly at the floor.\n\n\"You're right.\" He got up and paced across the room, his hands behind\nhis back.  The shield went down, and the girl reentered with the boy.\nShe addressed herself to Morgan.\n\n\"I'm sorry I was short with you.  I'm sure if you're with Lawrence you\nhave your reasons.  You just caught me off guard.\"  The men exchanged\nglances, but did not reply.  \"I'm willing to do what I can.....  You\nmust be hungry.\"\n\n\"No.  Thank you, I must be going.  I apologize too.  My name is Morgan.\n Keep in touch, Lawrence.  This will take time, but there are other\nthings you and I can do until then.  Elonna.\"  He rose and lifted the\nrifle and left the room.  The boy approached Lawrence and punched him\nin the leg.  The man looked down but did not smile.\n\n\"Why so grim?\" she asked, not entirely able to keep the sarcasm from\nher voice.\n\n\"You don't know what we're up against.\"\n\n\"Finding my husband dead on the balcony, I think I have a pretty good\nidea.....  And how many did you lose?\"\n\n\"I didn't have to.  My family was killed in a transport accident two\nyears ago.\"\n\n...  \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Then don't speak of it again.\"\n\n...  \"Are you hungry?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Yes, I'm hungry.  Why don't you see if you can make us something\nthat doesn't taste like tar.  I'm going to lie down.  Wake me if I fall\nasleep.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nShe went to prepare a meal.  The child followed.  When the food was\nready she called him and they ate without talking.  The only sounds\nwere the small sounds of the boy, tapping his tray with the utensil and\nhumming softly to himself.  Once he looked up at the woman and laughed:\n a piece of withered leaf was caught in her dark, flowing hair.  The\ngraying man watched them, and only wished he could smile.\n\nThen night came again, and they slept.\n\n\n*\n\n\nFour days had passed, with Lawrence gone much of the time.  He never\nsaid where he was going, or gave any indication that something unusual\nwas at hand.  But on the fifth day, as the sun sank and the shadows\ngrew deep around them, he said simply,\n\n\"I've got something to do tonight.\"\n\nHe was, if possible, tighter than ever, and at the evening meal ate\nlittle.  Then he rose, ruffled the boy's head, and disappeared into the\nsecond shallow chamber of the back.\n\nHe was gone a long time, and the girl took the boy outside, and when\nshe returned he had still not come out.  Then as she knelt on the\nground, playing some game with the child, a man emerged from the back\nand she nearly collapsed from fear.\n\nShe ran to the wall, seized the rifle and would have shot.  But a\nfamiliar voice stayed her.\n\n\"Put down the rifle, Elonna, or one of these times you really will\nshoot.\"  The voice, she thought, came from the stranger, a square,\nRussian-looking man with dark eyes and a shaved head.  He was clad in\nthe blue and black of a Cantonese army officer, the emblem of the\nclenched white fist sewn to his breast, a small black cross in its\ncenter.  His face wore the sharp look of command but his eyes, in that\nmoment, seemed to contradict it.\n\n\"Who are you?\" she demanded.  \"And what have you done with Lawrence?\"\n\n\"I'm right here, Elonna.\"  The officer opened his jacket and unfastened\nthe garment beneath, pulling it open at the neck to reveal a dark\ncollar and chest, with tight curls of hair like thorny bushes covering\nhis breast.\n\n\"Lawrence!\"  One of her hands lost its grip on the rifle.  \"You scared\nme half to death.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for that.  I thought you had gone out.\"\n\nAt that moment she realized two things:  that he was going into great\ndanger, and that she cared for him very much.\n\n\"When must you go?\"\n\n\"Very soon.\"  He resealed the uniform.\n\n\"Be careful, will you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"  He pulled a different weapon from among the equipment against\nthe wall, examined it carefully.  \"I have to go.\"  He started for the\ndoor.  She stopped him halfway and embraced him, her eyes gleaming at\nthe corners.\n\n\"Be careful.\"\n\n\"I will.\"  He pulled away and stood in the entrance.  He looked back at\nher strangely, hesitated as if wanting to say more, then turned and was\ngone.  He did not return that night.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe next day the woman was genuinely concerned.  She had just begun to\nlose hope, when the smoky film of the entrance dissolved and opened out\nonto the cleft.  A man stepped through, but it was not Lawrence.\n\n\"Morgan?  What's wrong, where's Lawrence?\"\n\n\"He's dead.\"\n\nSuch an empty shock.  \"What?  What happened?\"\n\nHe was trying to sabotage a missile base, with several others.  His\npapers were challenged and he was shot.  I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Dead,\" she stammered.  \"Dead.  Will they kill us all, one by one?\"\nShe began to weep.\n\n\"Unless we stop them.\"\n\n\"How, damn it!  How?\"\n\n\"A piece at a time.\"\n\n\"But you said you had a plan.  For ME.\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Well what is it?  Stop treating me like a child!\"\n\n\"Not now.  I'll come back tomorrow after dark.\"\n\n\"All right.  God.\"  She could not believe it.  He turned to go.\n\nWithout turning.  \"You'd best harden your heart, Elonna, or it will\nfreeze inside you.  I'm sorry about Lawrence.\n\nHe was gone.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe next day seemed endless, but at last he came.  He looked over the\nequipment leaned against the wall, then came and sat across from her.\nHe was at once both kinder and colder.\n\n\"I have a plan, Elonna, and them is a reasonable chance it will work.\nBut it may be more than your mind is equipped to handle.  Also. . .it\nis sexual in nature.\"\n\n\"You think I don't know that, the way you're always looking at me?\"\n\n\"Listen first.  Save your scorn for the enemy.  You will need it all.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry.  I'm not mad at you.\"\n\n\"Never, NEVER apologize.  And don't ever feel pity for a man who's done\nyou wrong.  If you do at a critical time in this, we're lost.\"\n\n\"You're worse than he was.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I'm still alive.\"  He stirred uncomfortably in the chair.  \"I\ndidn't mean that.  Have you got any water?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"  She sent the boy to get some.\n\n\"Try to understand, Elonna.  As undersecretary to Hunter, I'm\nsurrounded by them constantly.  These guerrillas, even Lawrence, flit\nin and out of the fire.\"\n\n\"Lawrence did more than flit.\"\n\n\"Yes he did.  And if I could change that, I would.....  But I live in\nthe midst of it. I can't afford the luxury of emotion.  And I want\ndesperately to bring them down.  That they're my own people doesn't\nhelp.\"\n\nShe studied him more closely.\n\n\"You say they're your own people.  What about us?  Are we just pieces\non the board?\"\n\n\"Not a fair question.  You don't know what we're up against.\"  The boy\nhanded him a filled cup.\n\n\"Lawrence was found of saying that, and he's dead.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I'm likely to end the same way.\"\n\n\"Then why do you do it?\"\n\n\"Because they ARE my own people.  Maybe you pity them, try to\nunderstand.  I don't.  There's no excuse for this, Elonna.  None.  It's\nall been played out a hundred times before.\n\n\"There lives are empty and harsh,\" he continued.  \"So they say it must\nbe somebody's fault.  Surely their God can't want them to suffer, apple\nof his eye as they're supposed to be.  So it must be anti-God.  And who\nis this?  The blacks and other minorities, the corrupt and inept\nliberals, a benign socialist colony two systems away.  For God's sake,\nwe've been in Space for two hundred years, we should know better.  They\nforget, or choose to ignore, all the lessons it's taught us:  that\nwe're only very small, and should help each other.  They turn their\nbacks on history and the simplest understanding, and still find some\ndark corner in which to masturbate their hatred.  There's no excuse for\nit.  None.\"\n\nShe was silent for a time, then spoke.  \"What do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Don't say yes until you've heard what it is.  Lawrence cared a great\ndeal for you, and if only for his sake, I must show some restraint.\"\n\n\"And what about you?\"\n\n\"For myself, I would rather not ask a woman to do it.  Also, it flushes\nme out of the inner circles for good.\"\n\n\"But you think it could work, and be worth it.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You want me to sleep with someone and kill him.\"  She had forgotten\nthe boy.  \"Johnny, would you run off in the back and play?  I'll be\nthere in a few minutes.\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Elonna.\"  He walked reluctantly into the back.\n\n\"You want me to sleep with someone and kill him.\"\n\n\"Yes and no.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, yes and no?\"\n\n\"You say it as if it's nothing.  I'm not asking you to sleep with some\nsoldier in a guardhouse and slit his throat.  We're talking about\nRoland Hunter, the head of Internal Affairs.\"\n\n\"THE Hunter?  The man who ordered the purges?\"\n\n\"Ordered, planned and executed, and the man who makes sure there is no\nrebellion of conscience among the whites, no dissent of any kind.  A\nbig target, Elonna, and very wary.\"  Again she was silent.\n\n\"Still.  If you could arrange it.....  I think I could do it.\"\n\n\"With what weapon, Elonna?\"\n\n\"Well, what about a poison needle?\"\n\n\"No good.  You will be thoroughly searched.  Thoroughly.\"\n\n\"All right, then.  Stop turning it around.  You're the one who's\nsupposed to have a plan.\"\n\n\"Yes, though I'm not particularly proud of having thought of it.\"\n\n\"Morgan, you're forgetting what he's done to us.\"\n\n\"All right.  Have you ever heard of Sanlen 12?\"\n\n\"It's some kind of nerve poison, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, like's snake's venom:  poison to the blood but not the stomach.\"\n\n\"What are you saying?\"\n\nHe told her, in detail.\n\n\"But that's horrible.  God, what a way to die. . .and to kill.\"\n\n\"You would have to want to kill him very badly, and not hesitate at the\ncritical moment.  That's why I've been such a harsh judge of your\ncharacter.  This is no game, and the stakes are life and death.\"  She\nlooked into his eyes, and knew he was in deepest earnest.\n\n\"I need time to think.\"  The boy came back into the room.\n\n\"I'll be back tomorrow night.  Think about it in the cold light of day.\nYou must be very sure.\"  He lifted his rifle.\n\n\"Before you go.....\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How would you set this up?  How would you make him trust me?\"\n\n\"Oh, he won't trust you, not for a minute.  But he does trust me, as\nfar as he trusts anyone.  As for setting it up, that's fairly simple.\nMany of the cabinet ministers and high military men have taken\nmistresses, and not all of them white.  If the Undersecretary of\nAffairs should happen to come across a beautiful black woman he\nfancies, a non-person with no rights, why shouldn't he keep her for\nhimself?  And if he's ruthless and full of ambition, as I'm supposed to\nbe, why shouldn't he offer to share her with the Secretary, or even\nkeep her discreetly hidden for his private use?  I've been known to do\nsuch favors in the past.\"\n\n\"But if he hates us so much, why would he want me?\"\n\n\"You don't understand men very well if you have to ask, at least not\nthat kind of man.  Power and domination are what he craves, sadism and\ntotal control.  Do I have to say more?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I'll come back tomorrow if I can.\"  He shouldered his weapon.  \"You\nsee why it was so hard for Lawrence to ask of you.  Toward the end, he\nhad decided against it.  Just so you know, the thought of sending you\nin with that monster.....  I'm not that cold.  Not yet.  But they are.\nGood-night.\"  He switched off the shield and left the cave.\n\n\"Good-night.\"  She stared at the table.\n\n\n*\n\n\nMorgan returned two nights later.  He looked tired and grim.\n\n\"Elonna.  I'm sorry I couldn't make it yesterday.  I almost couldn't\ncome now.  They're preparing the full offensive against Marcum-Lauries.\n I'm just sick thinking about it.  The Laurians don't stand a chance.\nAnd they're good people.\"  As he glanced at her briefly she saw\nsomething in his eyes that she had not expected.  He looked away.\n\"Hello, Johnny,\" he said absently.  Without being asked, the boy ran\ninto the back to get him some water.\n\n\"Sit down, Morgan.  Don't worry about me, I'm all right.  I'm even\ngrateful for the extra day.  I'm finally clear in my own mind.\"\n\n\"You know you don't have to do this.\"\n\n\"Yes.  But I want to, Morgan.\"  She handed him the cup and sat down.\n\"Only. . .I can't do it by hating them.  I've tried.  I tried\nremembering my husband's death, but that only made me feel a terrible\nloss, not hatred.  So I tried thinking about what they had done to\nLawrence.  Sometimes I think all he ever wanted was to live out his\nremaining years in peace.  But he couldn't.  They had taken even that\naway from him.  He was no soldier, any more than Eric was.  War was the\nlast thing either wanted, and it killed them both---my husband quickly,\nand Lawrence slowly, from the inside.  He tried to be hard and cold,\nbut his faith in life had been shaken too deeply.  Do you know what I'm\nsaying?\"\n\n\"Yes, though I think there was more to it than that.\"\n\n\"Maybe.  I'm just trying to tell you how I feel.\"\n\nTheir eyes met.  \"Go on.\"\n\n\"I'm going to try to kill him, because I know something must be done.\nBut it's not in my nature to be vindictive.  I'll be as passive and\nyielding as I can, and then just do it.\"\n\nMorgan took a deep breath.  \"You know there's the danger of being found\nout, or of being killed afterwards?\"\n\n\"Yes.  And I'm not just saying that.\"\n\n...  \"Well.  I admire your courage.  And I'll do everything I can to\nprotect you.\"  He took a long, slow draught from the cup.  \"One thing,\nanyway.  I won't have to be a part of their cancer anymore.  I won't\nhave to keep silent.\"  He lowered his head in exhaustion.  \"Have you\ngot anything stronger?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Lawrence kept some whiskey.\"  She rose to get it.\n\nThey talked together far into the night.  Then he said goodbye, and\nmade his way stealthily back to the high-security apartment complex,\nand by a way known only to himself, entered the wide bedroom.  The next\nnight he returned with a dental surgeon, who implanted a small capsule\nfilled with poison onto the bottom of her tongue, and sharpened to a\ncutting edge the canine tooth on the corresponding side of her mouth.\nThey made arrangements for the boy, and set a tentative date for five\ndays hence.  That day, at least, she would come and live with him.\n\n\n*                        *                        *\n\n\nThe flat was wide and spacious, divided into three sections.  Coming\nthrough the front door, one entered the large living area, the room\nitself recessed to the right a foot lower than the polished hardwood\nwalk-in.  Deeply carpeted, it was furnished with long, pillowy couches\nand stiff upright chairs.  Low tables of stainless steel and glass were\nspread among them.  The in-wall, farthest from the walkway, consisted\nof a broad Earthstone hearth (a luxury), and was crowned above the\nmantle by a photograph of the First Minister, awarding the Medal of\nValor to a tall, stern-faced soldier.  A barrage of terraced and\nhanging plants surrounded the slanting, beamed windows of the western\nwall.  Its opposing face was a wall-size entertainment screen, now\nprojecting a tropical rainforest with a high, flowing waterfall in the\nbackground.\n\nThe bedroom opened off the walkway to the left, behind a thick double\ndoor of oak.  The kitchen was straight ahead, and by a further passage,\nthe workroom or den.\n\nElonna sat beside him on one of the couches, its deep-cushioned comfort\nbelying the approaching danger.  She moved closer, and quite\nunconsciously, put her head against his neck.  Morgan put his arm\naround her and stared at nothing.  She was clothed in mistress fashion,\na long dress of sunburst silk and mesh.\n\n\"When will they be here, Morgan?\"\n\n\"Soon, I think.  Try not to worry.\"\n\n\"May I have another drink?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"  He started to rise.\n\n\"No, nevermind.  Don't get up.  I'll be all right; just don't get up.\"\nHe drew her closer, warmed her shoulder with his hands.\n\n\"Remember,\" he said, \"don't worry about looking scared.  You play the\npart of a refugee among enemies, saving yourself by being my mistress.\nYour natural reactions, whatever they are, will be all right.\"\n\n\"Well I'm glad of that.  Oh Morgan, I wish it was over.\"\n\n\"So do I.....  Oh, also.  Don't be alarmed if he speaks of your past or\nyour family.  He'll have found all that out ahead of time.\"\n\n\"I'm scared.\"\n\nA warning light lit above the doorway.\n\n\"They're in the building.\"\n\n\"How many?\" she asked, fighting back a surge of fear.\n\n\"I don't know.  I'll try to find out.\"  He got up and went to an\nintercom by the door, moved his hand across it.  \"Lieutenant.  How many\nhave we got tonight?\"\n\n\"Six, Undersecretary.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Walthrop.\"  He switched it off.  \"Six.\"\n\n\"Why so many?\"\n\n\"Probably to check the rooms.  I don't think they'll stay.\"  Several\nseconds later the door tone sounded.  He turned to Elonna.  \"You okay?\"\n She took a deep breath.  He opened the door.\n\nThe Secretary entered, preceded by his two bodyguards.  Two uniformed\nsoldiers followed.  Morgan addressed them sternly.  Another soldier\nremained in the hallway.\n\n\"So this is the little lovely,\" said Hunter civilly, nodding towards\nher.  He gave his long officer's coat to Morgan, and the two uniformed\nmen began to sweep the room with hand-held detectors.  Her eyes drawn\nto him by some morbid curiosity, Elonna studied the Secretary.\n\nIn his late forties or early fifties, he was a man of average height,\nblonde-gray and gaunt, still retaining a taut musculature that showed\nitself in the square shoulders and stiffly upright posture.  He had a\nlean, hard face with prominent cheekbones and brow.  But what held her\nattention most---Morgan opened a bedroom door for one of the\nsoldiers---were his eyes.  Steel gray and cold, they looked out\nrestless and insatiable.  And though they did not flit, as with lesser\nmen, they nonetheless seemed unable to rest their gaze on anything for\nmore than a short time, as if never satisfied with what they saw, angry\nand bitter because of it.  But when they returned again to her, she\nknew it would be very hard.  He followed the silk dress up the long\nlength of her body, and into her eyes.  Here was something he wanted.\n\nBut even as she looked away, she felt a new determination growing out\nof her despair.  And though for a moment she had seen him with woman's\neyes, sensing the underlying weakness and need, she felt no pity for\nhim.  His self-malignation and inner violence had cost thousands of\nlives already.  If it were at all within her power, they would cost no\nmore.\n\nIt was at this same time that she decided upon a strategy.  Morgan's\nplan had been to lie and act as little as possible, and to decide at\nthe time which of three contingent courses to adopt.  In this way he\nhoped to avoid unnecessary risk.  She glanced over at him quickly,\nlooking broken and hurt, and both understood:  she had been told of\nthis ahead of time, and though no longer shocked or capable of much\nfear, she felt shamefully and bitterly betrayed.  She sat down again\ndejectedly and hung her head, without having said a word.  Then let a\nsingle tear trickle down her cheek, and wiped it away.\n\nHad they known it, this was probably the best course they could have\nadopted.  This was not what he wanted---a broken and dispirited\nprisoner.  He wanted something still alive, desiring freedom and\ncapable of struggle.  At once he called the soldiers to him.\n\n\"That is all.  Leave the one at the door and get below.\"\n\n\"He has a rifle in the study,\" said one.\n\n\"I know that as well as you.  You have your orders.\"\n\nThey touched their chests with a closed right fist and were gone.  He\nseated his guards in two chairs placed on either side of the bedroom\ndoors.\n\n\"I would like a drink, Morgan.  Bring one for yourself, and for the\nlady.  Whatever she likes.\"  When he had left the room, Hunter moved to\nsit in a high-backed chair across from her.  She looked up at him,\npuzzled.\n\n\"Please, you must not be afraid of me.  Your master is a hard man\nbecause he has to be.  We are not ogres.\"  It was suddenly important to\nhim that Morgan had never had her.  \"No one is going to hurt you.\nPlease, won't you trust me?\"  She said nothing, continued looking down.\n The tall man began to re-enter the room, but Hunter waved him off.\n\"Has Morgan been treating you well?\"\n\n\"Yes, very well.\"  There were almost tears in her eyes.  \"But I thought\nI was going to be his.  I've been good.\"\n\n\"Of course you have.\"  Now he let Morgan enter.  On his tray were three\ndrinks in narrow glasses.  He gave one to the Secretary, who drew out a\nlong stick (for sensing poison) and submerged it in the glass.  He gave\nanother to Elonna and took the third for himself, sitting in a chair at\na small distance to one side.\n\n\"Please, drink up,\" said Hunter.  \"To your health, Elonna.\"  She made\nthe toast halfheartedly.  \"Let's have some music, Morgan.  Do you have\na Beethoven program?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"  He rose to put it on.\n\n\"You like Beethoven, don't you?\"  She nodded.\n\nAnd so the time passed, with music, small talk and drinks.  At\nintervals the Secretary asked simple questions about her health,\npromised she could stay here with Morgan, even hinted that the purges,\nghastly but imperative, were now over, and that if she had any friends\nor relatives still in hiding, perhaps they could be given safe conduct\noff the planet.\n\nIndeed, so much time had passed that she began to think nothing more\nwould happen that night.  But it was this very gleam of hope that he\nwaited for.\n\n\"Will you allow us one more small inconvenience?\"  The tone of his\nvoice seemed to imply that nothing more than a routine question was\nforthcoming, some sad necessity, painless and quickly over.  But some\ndeeper instinct warned her that the time had come.\n\n\"Yes, what is it?\"\n\n\"Would you go back into the bedroom and take off your clothes?  One of\nmy guards will search you; he shouldn't be too rough.  You see, I want\nto lie with you tonight.\"\n\nHer mouth opened as if to speak, but no words would form.  The final\nattack had come so softly and suddenly that she found she could not\nreact.  Through the liquor her blood went pale.  She turned to Morgan,\nbut he could not help her now.  She had to gather herself.  Somehow.\nSomehow.        \"Is that what you really want?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is.\"  She brushed back her face with her hands.\n\n\"All right.\"  She got up slowly, did not collapse.\n\n\"Snipes.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Do it.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"  The guard took her by the arm and led her past the other,\nwho held open the bedroom door.\n\n\"What's the matter, Morgan?  Surely you knew I would want her?\"  Morgan\nsaid nothing.  His eyes were cold and hard.\n\nAfter several minutes, the Secretary got up and made his way to the\nbedroom.  The guard, returning out of it with a nod, passed by him and\nshut the door.  He resumed his seat beside the other and the two looked\nstraight ahead.  Several moments later the door opened again, from the\ninside, and Hunter's head appeared.\n\n\"Oh by the way,\" he said.  \"Don't let him into the study.  You won't go\nanywhere will you, Morgan?\"  The doors closed for the last time.\nMorgan gripped the arms of the chair, burning up inside.\n\n\n*\n\n\nAfter several minutes he got up and began pacing back and forth,\npulling angri-nervoursly at a heavy ring on his right hand.  The guards\nwatched him.  Sounds still came from the bedroom at irregular\nintervals, horrible to hear.  That they were muffled didn't help.  At\nlast he felt that he must make his move.\n\n\"May I go into the kitchen?  I want another drink.\"\n\nThe guards exchanged glances.  The larger of the two said, \"Go with\nhim.\"  The other rose and followed him into the kitchen.\n\n\"You want one?\" asked the Undersecretary gruffly.\n\n\"You know I can't.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"  He looked past the standing man's shoulder.  \"Wait a\nminute.  Sergeant, what's that?\"\n\nThe guard half turned to look behind him.  There was a flash of metal\nas Morgan brought the blade-tipped ring across his neck.  The man\nstaggered but made no sound, as the poison collapsed both lungs and\nheart.  Morgan carried him by the armpits and set him down, dead, in a\nchair.  He unclasped the pistol from the man's belt and peered out into\nthe hallway.\n\nAt that moment there was a cry, suddenly stifled, from the bedroom.\nThe voice belonged to a man.  The bodyguard leapt up from his seat.\n\n\"Forget about it, Snipes.\"\n\n\"Morgan.  What are you doing with that?  Where's Bonnard?\"  Morgan\nfired two short bursts into his chest, then casting aside the body,\nbroke open the door and entered the bedroom.\n\nElonna sat shaking on the edge of the bed, trying to dress herself.\nHunter lay dead upon the floor, his face contorted wildly, his limbs\ndrawn up like a shriveled spider.  A trickle of blood could be seen at\nhis crotch.\n\n\"Are you all right?\"  Morgan asked.  He helped her into the coverall,\nswept back her tear stained hair.  There was a sharp sound as the outer\ndoor was thrown open.  A lone soldier rushed in, was killed by Morgan.\n\n\"Are you well enough to run?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"  She shook her head severely, trying to force herself back.  \"He\nwas really very gentle at the beginning.\"\n\n\"Don't think about it.  We've got to get you out.  As soon as his pulse\nstopped the soldiers below knew it.  Come on!  We've got to get you\nout!\"\n\nHe threw back the carpet beside the bed, lifted a trap door.  They had\njust shut it behind them when four more soldiers burst into the room.\nWith a shout their captain ran past the body, now half covered by the\nrug, and fired a laser burst into the lock.  It fused and fell inward,\nbut even as it did so the door was sealed from without by thick bars of\ntreated steel.  The captain tried to lift it, realized his mistake.\n\n\"Tarkin, Nemiah, get your men below and fan out.  Block all exits.\"  He\nlifted his hand-com, ordered the building and neighboring sections\nsurrounded, called in air patrols to block the skies.  He rolled back\nthe carpet with his foot, looked with angry disgust upon the body of\nHunter.  Two men in white entered with a stretcher.\n\n\"Get him out of here.\"  They lifted the body and took it away.  The\ncaptain paced the floor.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe passage, after its beginnings beneath the trap door, was shallow\nand not wide, so shallow they had to lie flat and pull themselves along\nby staggered hand-holds above them.  After perhaps a minute, though it\nseemed far longer, they came to the emergency ladder-tube, began to\nclimb.\n\nReaching the roof, they saw the police ship and the man (one of their\nown) guarding it.  He nodded to Morgan, ran toward the railing of\nconverging walls as if alarmed by sounds from below.  Morgan came\nbehind and clubbed him unconscious with the butt of the rifle.  He\nleapt up into the ship, where Elonna was already strapping herself in.\nHer hands would not stop shaking.  He jammed the door shut, made ready\nto lift off.  Six seconds later, they were in the air.\n\nHe started the small, fast ship forward just as the first of the air\npatrols drew near him.  He fired twice and banked sharply left.\n\nHis shots went high and wide, and as he turned, the lead ship strafed\nhis exposed underside.  Smoke and trickling flame burst out within and\nthe shields collapsed, but he kept the ship moving.  Broken by the\nconcussion, Elonna lay limp in her seat, only the harness keeping her\nin place.  He steered the ship low between a gap in the oncoming hills,\nas unseen emplacements opened fire on his pursuit.\n\n\n*\n\n\nMorgan stepped wearily through the entrance of the unfamiliar cave,\ntrying to support his broken shoulder with the opposite hand.  The boy\nbroke free from the woman's grasp and came toward him.  Seeing only the\nman, he broke into an angry despair.\n\n\"Where's Miss Elonna?\" he cried.\n\nMorgan tried to speak, but the boy ran up to him in tears, punching and\nkicking.\n\nThen Elonna passed through the narrow arch.\n\n\"No, Johnny, don't.  It's all right.  I'm all right.\"\n\nShe wiped the tears and grime from her face and knelt and hugged him\ndeeply.  The child buried himself against her.\n\n\n........................................................................\n.........\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTALAGMITE\n\n\nThe day was so dark that Dobrynin began to wonder if something wasn't\nseriously wrong.  He stopped the pede-like cruiser at the foot of the\ngreat volcano, looked up through the glass at the warping sky.  Black\nclouds continued to roil up from countless hollow, sharp-edged peaks\nall across the planet.\n\nThe satellite readout only confirmed what his eyes and instincts told\nhim.  Tremors and quakes shook the ground beneath him as a heavy static\nstorm crackled white and spindly light through the poison atmosphere.\nMarcum-Lauries One was caught between the pull of its two suns, which\nhappened roughly every three hundred years.  But even so, internal\npressures were much too high.  It boded ill for the hopes of his people\nif the massive, ore-laden planet stopped producing.\n\n\"Damn.\"  Molten silicates were running down the sides of the volcano's\nshattered peak.  He re-engaged the flexing wheel pods and headed back\ntoward the dome.\n\nHow he hated this war.  Not just for the killing.  Any fool knew that\nlife was no great gift, and death no injury.  One took care of his own,\nforged what meaning he could, then surrendered in the end to oblivion.\n\nBut this war.  This stupid, wasteful war.  How many times must the same\nstory be told?  Poverty and abuse on Canton leading to discontent, the\nfascists coming to power, spreading their hatred in the name of God and\nwhite supremacy.  And of course a remote socialist settlement, theirs,\nhad proved the ideal target for a tune-up campaign.  If they hadn't\ngone straight for the Khrushchev colony he would probably have laughed.\n Fascism must inevitably fail, just as humanist Marxism would never\ndie.  The Cantons would surely be put down, but not before many things\ninnocent and beautiful had been maimed forever.  Fascists!  In spite of\nall that he knew he could almost hate them without thinking.\n\nAnd their own tentative alliance with Soviet Space.  How long would\nthat last if the gold, tungsten and osmo-alloys stopped coming?  This\nplanet was the key, and at the moment not a very sure bet.  All he\ncould do was go back to the safety (relative safety) of the dome and\nwait for Percy's report, and see if the Soviet astronomers had anything\nintelligent to say.\n\nHe suddenly realized as he crawled in segments across a gap in the high\nridge. . .that he loved this place.  Yes, loved it.  The wide valley\nthat opened before him, even in turmoil, was beautiful to the point of\npain.  Who could not feel the beauty of its raw vastness?  His wife and\ncolleagues on the tamer Lauries II had always thought him demented.\nTHE STORMS, THE LONG NIGHTS, they would say.  But he had never minded\nthe storms or the dark.  They merely seemed to him a metaphor for life.\n Yes, life was a storm; that thought heartened him.  Perhaps this was\njust another, if more severe.  No, he knew better.  The fascists were\nreal and the planet was in trouble.  The flux of power among the Space\ngiants now favored the United Commonwealth, which remained neutral but\nrefused to allow the Soviets to intervene.  And the German States, God\ndamn them.  For all their greatness and determination they still\nretained a stubborn streak of the Nazi mentality.  There was little\nquestion who they would side with if it ever came to such a choice.  It\nwas all quite hopeless.  His people were just pilgrims and this, too,\nwould never be their home.\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes.  But I do not give up!\"\n\nThe dome was in sight and he was drawing closer.  He was there.  He\nguided the high-gravity cruiser between two of the eight supporting\nstruts arcing down from the huge floor, the raised structure.  He\nwaited for the lift to be lowered, crawled up onto it.  The airlock was\nopened, and the cruiser raised inside it.  The doors were shut below\nhim and breathable air whispered around him.  He opened the hatch,\nclimbed down and greeted his son.\n\n\"Leon.  Any news?\"  The young man seemed troubled, though he was doing\nhis best to conceal it.\n\n\"Yes, and none of it good.  Salnikov is on the communicator.  I'd\nbetter let him explain it.\"\n\nThey walked quickly to the high wall of the dock, rose in separate\ntubes to a curving corridor on the primary floor.  From this they\nentered the meeting room.  A large screen at the front of it showed the\ndispassionate face of Vladimir Salnikov, Soviet ambassador to\nMarcum-Lauries Independent.  They pushed past the chairs of an oval\ntable and went to the railing before it.\n\n\"Yes, Vladimir.  What have you got?\"\n\n\"I've been talking with Science Central,\" said the ambassador.  \"We\nknow what the problem is, but are not yet certain what is causing it.\"\n\n\"Well are you going to tell me or do I have to guess it?\"  If all the\nstars in Space had suddenly gone out, it would never show on that face.\n\n\"Easy, Nicholai.  I am on your side?\"  Dobrynin gave a reluctant nod.\n\"Your planet is in serious trouble.  She will not engage her second\norbit.  She only remains at the equilibrium point between the two, and\nloses almost six minutes each rotation.  Internal pressures, as I am\nsure you know, are dangerously high.  If something does not change\nsoon, she will blow herself apart.  You have perhaps ninety-eight\nhours.\"\n\n...  \"Why, Vladimir?  Why?\"\n\n\"We cannot be sure, except to say there is no natural phenomenon that\nwould explain it.\"  A pause.\n\n\"Is there anything else you can tell me?\"\n\n\"Not for the record.\"\n\n\"What about off it?\"\n\n\"Go to scramble,\" said the Soviet.  \"Code 4.\"\n\nHis son made the necessary adjustments.  Salnikov began again, the\nwords no longer corresponding to the movement of his lips.\n\n\"Can you understand me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Have you sent out your reconnaissance?\"\n\n\"Yes, toward Cantos.\"\n\n\"Deviate course.  There is nothing there.\"\n\n\"Where should we go instead?\"\n\nSalnikov gave a set of coordinates:  a straight line out from the\nplanet, directly opposed to its trajectory, as it sought to cross the\nintersection of its figure-eight orbit, and begin to move around the\nsecond sun.\n\n\"What should we look for?\"\n\n\"An enormous station, over one hundred kilometers across.  You won't\npick it up on laser or visual, but if you send someone out you will see\nit clear enough.\"\n\n\"What is its function?\"\n\n\"We don't know, and we are not about to go in and find out.  But its\nlocation is suspicious.  That is all I can say.\"\n\n\".....okay.  Thank you, Vladimir.\"\n\n\"Good luck, Nicholai.  I think that you will need it.\"  The screen went\nblank.\n\n\"Leon. go down to the lower communication room and signal all bases.  I\nwant everyone off---everyone.  These domes won't hold forever.  I'm\ngoing to try and reach Percy.\"\n\nWithout further speech his son was gone.  He leaned over the railing\nand tried, and after twenty minutes finally succeeded, in reaching the\nracing ship.\n\n\n\n\nThe planet had been evacuated.  The heads of the geological and mining\ncrews, along with military, scientific and governmental heads from the\nthree colonies, were huddled together in a briefing room aboard the\nspace station 'Lynx'.  Dobrynin stood behind the podium and signaled\nfor quiet, wanting desperately to get started.  If only he could get\nhis hands to work at something.  He tapped the quiet buzzer impatiently.\n\n\"Gentlemen, please.  We haven't much time.\"  Those still standing were\nseated, and the last rustle of voices died away.  All eyes went forward.\n\n\"I'm sure I don't have to tell you the spot we're in,\" he began.  \"You\nall know that ML One is in trouble.  What you don't know is why.  I\nhave just learned myself, and it is hard to believe.  But it's true.\nThe orbit of Marcum-Lauries is being tampered with from outside.  The\nproblem is man-made.\"\n\nExpressions of shock and disbelief.  TIMID FOOLS, thought Dobrynin,\nTHAT IS ALL FOR THE GOOD.  THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT.  But there\nwere others who said nothing:  the miners, the workers.  They, too,\nonly wanted to know what could be done.\n\nHe dimmed the lights and switched a graphic onto the wall-screen behind\nhim:  a binary system, the elliptical figure-eight of the planet's\norbit encircling two nearly identical suns.  He pointed to the lower\nright junction of the crossover point.\n\n\"Here is where she lies now.  Every 304.62 earth years, she completes\nher orbit around the first sun, in this case Lauries, and passing the\nequilibrium point between the two, begins to circle the second in the\nopposite direction.  There is a period of instability as she lies\nbetween the pull of both; but nothing like this.  Then slowly the pull\nof the first sun grows less, she engages her second orbit, and\ngeological activity becomes more stable.  All quite simple.  There are\nseveral examples of it just in the part of the galaxy we know.\"\n\n\"So how can a man change it?\" came a voice.\n\n\"One man can't, obviously.  But many men, with much planning and\noutside help, can and have.\"\n\nHe expanded the graphic, receding the orbit and two suns to a lower\ncorner.  Then tracing with the pointer a straight line away from the\nplanet's trajectory, he projected near the center of the screen a\nminiature (but still too large for scale) image of the enemy station\nthat Percy had photographed in ultraviolet and sent back to them.  This\nhe enlarged, until it filled all the screen.\n\nAgain expressions of dismay, and this time few kept silent.  Its\nalready ominous outline distorted by the ultraviolet, it looked like\nthe huge, black and irregular hull of an ancient aircraft carrier, with\nsomething like an enormous radar dish mounted securely to the\ncorrugated deck.  As he rotated the image its high, central tower was\npointed directly at them.\n\n\"This is the cause of our troubles.\"  He resolved the image with the\nremote, turned it once more to show three similar but lesser tower\nstructures spread across the bottom, an irregular tripod.\n\n\"The concept of a gravity or 'tractor' beam is nothing new.  It has\nusually been used from ship to ship, or from static base to ship.  Its\nprincipals to date have either been magnetic, the creation of\nartificial gravity, or kinetic, scrambling an object's own momentum to\nbring it down.  What we have here is the first case, a gravity beam,\nthough on a scale, and utilizing principles that are altogether new.\nThe towers at the bottom of the structure are pointed at neighboring\nbodies, and serve only to hold the station in place.  The central\ntower, the one doing all the damage, is pointed directly at\nMarcum-Lauries.  That is why she won't engage her second orbit.  That's\nwhy internal pressures are ready to blow her apart.  She is being\npulled by three sources at once, as well as by the thrust of her own\nrotation.....  We have eighty-six hours at the most.\"\n\nHe re-lighted the room, and for a time there was silence.  Then as the\nshock wore off, the questions began to come.  He answered them with\ngrowing impatience.\n\n\"I don't know how it is possible, vice-minister, but it is.....  The\nSoviets confirm our theories.....  Where would they get the money and\ntechnology?  Where do you think?  No we cannot be sure.  But if it\nisn't the German States then I don't know anything.  No, the\nCommonwealth won't help us; why should they?  The Soviets are powerless\nto intervene.\"\n\n\"But if the Commonwealth knew what the Cantons were doing---\"\n\n\"They would applaud it.  They are in the midst of a right wing\nresurgence themselves.  And the propaganda sent out against us has been\nmost convincing.\"\n\n\"They say we kill our babies,\" came a grim voice near the front.\n\n\"We let the seriously handicapped and terminal disorder cases die of\ntheir own affliction.  It is an act of mercy.\"  A doctor.\n\n\"I know that as well as you,\" said Dobrynin.  \"But to them we kill our\nbabies, just as we are atheists who believe in nothing, because we\ndiscourage religious extremes.  That is all meaningless now.  They will\nthink what they will.  We have no time to change their minds.\"\n\n\"We are overlooking the obvious,\" said a general, standing.  \"What\nabout military action, an attack on the base?  Our forces beat them\nback from Khrushchev well enough.\"\n\nThis time another answered, Ambassador Salnikov, who had just entered.\n\n\"You beat them back because you knew they were coming weeks in advance,\nand because they did not send their full strength against you.  Indeed,\nit could only have been a diversion, meant to give you false\nconfidence.  Do not think you will find the station lightly guarded,\nGeneral Kopek.  THEY  (there was something peculiar in the way he said\nthe word) play this game to win.\"\n\n\"What does an ambassador know of war?\" retorted Kopek angrily.\n\n\"Much more than I care to.  Put away your guns and your anger, general.\n They will not help you here.\"  The old man sat down with a snort.\n\nThere was a long, defeated silence.  Finally one man, a co-worker and\nfriend, raised his hand.\n\n\"Yes, Lebedev.\"\n\n\"What can we do to fight this thing?\"\n\nDobrynin felt the small spark inside him that he knew to be hope.\n\n\"Well I am glad someone asked.  We are not beaten yet.  Stein, you are\nchief scientist here.  What flaws do you see in the Canton scheme?\"\n\nThe tall man rose, bowed his head self-consciously.  \"Well, governor.\nAs we discussed before, I see two problems for the station.  First, if\nthe tripod is indeed used as an anchor---and this seems likely---and if\nthe gravity beam is as strong as it must be to do this thing, then the\npull on the station itself must be tremendous.  Doubtless it is well\nconstructed, of the hardest alloys and banding fields, for this\npurpose. . .and there may be other forms of cohesion as well.  But even\nso, I would have to say it cannot maintain that kind of stress for\nlong.  We are given eighty-six hours---though I must tell you that is\nonly an estimate, it could happen much sooner.  The Cantons must also\nknow this.  I do not think they have much longer.\"\n\n\"And the second?\"\n\n\"The second flaw is what puzzles me, and I think that herein lies our\nhope.  Any gravity beam, no matter how refined, can be at least\npartially disrupted by passing another object between the sending unit\nand the target.  This particular beam, in order to travel such a\ndistance and affect such a large, dense mass, is extraordinarily well\nhoned.  The solar flares of Marcum and Lauries have been only mildly\naffected.  So.  If we were able to pass a large mass, say an asteroid\nor small moon, between the planet and the station.....  During the time\nof disruption, should it be successful, we would not only give the\nplanet time to engage her second orbit, but also send a huge projectile\nplummeting directly at them.  I'm sure they are prepared for this to\nsome degree.  But a very large, solid object would be quite difficult\nto destroy or turn aside.  They would have no choice but to shut down\ncompletely, and very soon afterward at that.  Unfortunately, as we\ndiscussed, there are no asteroids or other large objects, of sufficient\nsize, close enough at hand to be moved into position in time.  Still,\nsomething of this nature seems our only real chance.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Thomas.\"\n\n\"Then what can---what will we do?\" asked many voices at once.\n\nDobrynin stood calm, until the murmur died away.\n\n\"We will make our own asteroid.\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"May I remind you, Governor, that you do not have the authority to\nexercise such a plan without the consent of the Council?\"  This last\nremark came from Franz Pecci, a slight, high-ranking member of the\nLeadership Council whom he had never liked.\n\n\"And may I remind you, Mr. Pecci, that as governor-general of the\nplanet I have final say on any decision which affects mining and\nexcavation.  My jurisdiction is quite clear.  And if you have a better\nplan, I would very much like to hear it.\"\n\n\"We could negotiate.  It seems clear that the Cantons don't want to\ndestroy us, only exact for themselves some future profit.  We have not\neven tried---\"  Dobrynin was about to answer hotly, when Vladimir\nSalnikov lifted his hand and strode to the front of the room.  He stood\nbeside the speaker.\n\n\"Governor Dobrynin's plan has the backing of my government.  I have\nspoken with them and they will stand behind it.  And someday, Mr.\nPecci, I would very much like to know how you can be so sure what it is\nthe Cantons want.\"  At this the man was silent.\n\n\"What say you, Vice-Minister?  Has this plan your consent?\"\n\nThe vice-minister rose.  \"Well.  I am sure the Minister will want to\nknow all the details, and I am sure he will question the risk.  But for\nmyself, you have my approval.  And I think when the Minister is briefed\nin full, he will agree that we have little choice.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Peter,\" said Dobrynin.  \"I will see that he is given a full\nreport, and that he is kept informed throughout.\"  He turned back to\nthe others.  \"Now, gentlemen, if you will excuse me.  My engineers and\nI have much work to do.  Doctor Stein, we could use your help as well.\"\n\n\nWith that Dobrynin left the room, followed by five others.  Salnikov\nwatched them go, then lowered his head, and returned to his ship.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe charges had been laid.  Two hundred kilometers beneath the surface,\nsix old-style nuclear explosives had been set in a flat, star-shaped\npattern---this, in the heart of a solidified iron and nickel flow one\nhundred and sixty kilometers across, rising directly from the planet's\ncore.  Ironically, the massive upheaval which caused it had occurred\nmany thousand years before, during yet another violent passage of the\nplanet's equilibrium point.  If such a bullet could be launched at the\nstation, it would indeed be hard to knock down, though the full effect\non the planet itself could hardly be calculated.  Between the force of\nthe blast and the current instability, almost anything was possible.\nDobrynin had no illusions about serious mining for at least a\nyear---that things could ever again be the way they were before.  But\nit had to be tried.\n\nIt has gone well enough so far, he thought.  Five dead and seventeen\nwounded, but still, well enough.  This is the hard part now.  I don't\nmind dying, if I have to.  But I don't want to.\n\nMAYBE YOU WON'T DIE, said a voice.  Yes, and maybe I will.  I hope that\nmy son understands.  I hope he sees that I have no choice.  BUT YOU\nHAVE A CHOICE.  Do I?  If there is a choice then I don't see it.  Not\nwithout surrendering all that we have worked for.  No.  I cannot go\nback.\n\nHis son entered the room, followed by Stein and Alexander Dimitriev,\nhis chief engineer.  At his gesture they were seated at the table\nacross from him.\n\n\"Thomas, Alexander.  Now we are come to the hard part:  how to detonate\nsafely and accurately.  As you know, in this, timing is everything.\nEverything.  If we miss by only a few seconds, we doom the planet to\nextinction.\"\n\n\"Is it true that you intend to remain behind?\" said Dimitriev, \"and\ndetonate the bombs yourself, from no greater distance than a thousand\nkilometers?\"\n\n\"Father!\"  YOU MUST UNDERSTAND, LEON.\n\n\"Before I say yes or no, let us look at the alternatives.  That is why\nyou are here.  I must know that you stand behind me.\"\n\n\"We could blow them by radio control.\"  His son.\n\n\"No.  With the static storms this heavy and unpredictable, they could\ndetonate too soon, or not at all.\"\n\n\"What about a laser-triggered mechanism above ground?\" asked Dimitriev.\n \"A fast moving ship could activate it, then be gone.\"  Dobrynin opened\nhis hand toward Stein.\n\n\"I'm afraid that's not possible,\" he conceded.  \"To avoid cloud cover\nand volcanic discharge the ship would have to fly very high.  And the\nway the upper atmosphere refracts light, even laser is not a sure\nthing.  And also, there is the problem of the gravity beam itself,\ndistorting the path of the ship.\"\n\nDimitriev turned away.\n\n\"Alexander, Leon.  Listen to me.  There is only one other chance that I\nsee, and it is not a good one.  We could build the laser-trigger upon a\nhigh tower, allowing me to activate it from the ground at a greater\ndistance.  But I am not sure we could construct such a tower in time.\nAnd also, it would cost more lives.\"  He looked at his son.  \"Or I\ncould detonate the bombs myself, safely and surely, by cable from\nLeopold Station.  I wish there was another way.\"\n\n\"But why does it have to be you?  You are needed---\"  His son broke off.\n\n\"Who would you have me send instead?  I am most qualified, except\nperhaps for Stein.  And this.....\"  He spoke now with difficulty.\n\"This is my home.  It is everything I have worked for.  If it is lost\nthen I. . .I would not want to live.  We have left the mainstream.  I\ndo not want to go back.\"  The room was still, and no one spoke.\n\nFinally Dimitriev rose and came toward him.  He offered him his hand,\nand Dobrynin took it in both of his own.\n\n\"Good hunting, Nicholai.  I am with you.\"  He turned and left the room.\n Stein rose also.\n\n\"I will have an approximate time, and prep the computer, at Leopold\nbefore I go.....  I think that it is possible.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Thomas.\"\n\nThe scientist bowed his head and was gone.  For a moment father and son\nstood looking down, and neither spoke.\n\n\"Why couldn't I do it in your place?\"\n\n\"You have not the skill.....  Your mother needs you.\"\n\n\"And not you?  Will you leave her alone?\"\n\n\"She has always been alone.  Forgive me.\"\n\n\"Father.\"  He was crying now, ashamed.\n\n\"Please, Leon.\"  His throat was thick.  \"You must be strong now.  I\nneed you to be strong.....  There is a chance I will not die.\"  His son\nleft the room.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeopold Station.  He sat with the button in front of him, on a console\nshelf amidst computers.  He studied its scopes and readouts carefully:\neight minutes.\n\nHe was glad that it was far away.  It did not seem real.  Almost---he\nwas thinking in Russian now---he was not afraid.  Perhaps he could\nreach the tube and down into the shelter in time.  If that would help.\nI MUST CONCENTRATE.  He breathed deeply, and watched the counter tick\naway his life.  Seven minutes.  Six.\n\nHe heard a sound behind him.  At that moment the image on one of the\nscreens shifted slightly.\n\n\"Turn around Dobrynin.\"\n\nHe whirled, startled, then returned quickly to the console, made the\nnecessary adjustments.  \"What do you think you're doing?\"\n\n\"Putting an end to your brave little noise.\"  Dobrynin said nothing.\n\"This gun fires nerve pellets as well as the other, Nicholai.  I can\nparalyze you without killing you.\"  Pecci's voice was calm, but there\nwas fear beneath it.\n\n\"And I can press this button and kill us both.  And if I die, how will\nyou survive?  Doctor Stein says the planet will not last another hour;\ndo you not feel the quakes?  You will perish along with it.\"  As he\nspoke he watched and moved his hands across the console, all the while\nfighting the bitter urge to detonate now:  too soon.\n\n\"You lie.\"\n\n\"No, Franz, in this I speak the truth.  Your only chance is to get down\nto the shelter, now, and I will forget what has passed between us.\"\nPecci said nothing.  Dobrynin knew that he must buy more time.\n\n\"It doesn't matter, does it?\"\n\n\"What?\"  He could feel the tension of the smaller man's mind.\n\n\"It doesn't matter that since I am twenty-five I have made no serious\nmistake, that myself and many beside me have worked hard for thirty\nyears to make this place our home.  It does not matter that we have\nbroken from the current.  Still, we are dependent on others.  We are\nlike the stalagmite, which must be fed from above.  If anything comes\nbetween us and the source, we are cut off.  We cannot grow.  And any\npuny, so-called man with a putrid hammer, can come and chisel away at\nour roots!\"  He could not contain his anger.\n\n\"I could kill you now!\" cried Pecci.  He raised the gun and would have\nshot, but at that moment Dobrynin put a hand to his ear.  A faint\nvoice, mingled with crackling static, had come suddenly into his almost\nforgotten ear-piece.\n\n\"Governor, can. . .hear me?\"  It was Stein.\n\n\"Yes, Thomas.  Try to speak louder.  What is it?\"\n\n\".....just received. . .information on the beam.  We. . .incorrect by.\n. . minutes.\"\n\n\"How many minutes?\"\n\n\"Four.  Must be sooner.  Thirty seconds. . .now.\"\n\n\"Thirty seconds!\" he cried.  And regretted it as soon as the words had\nleft his mouth.  He quickly punched twenty-five into the counter,\nforgetting all other instruments.\n\n\"Yes.....\"  Then no more was heard.\n\n\"Turn around, Dobrynin!\"\n\n\"Go muck yourself!\" he growled.  If he was going to die, then let it be\nlike Trotsky.\n\n14.  13.  12.\n\nPecci shot him in the back and killed him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n........................................................................\n............................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACT TWO\n\nAndersen, Korchnoi and Larkspur Sectors\nMonths I through V\nInternational Year: 2211\n\n\nINVERSIONS\n\n\"There are various theories as to how insect life came to exist on\nNewman's Planet, named for its American discoverer.  Most suggest that\nits seeds were somehow transported here from Earth, though there is\nlittle agreement as to how, naturally or otherwise, this was\naccomplished.  Others state that it must have evolved here naturally.\nBut this theory runs into equal difficulty.  For the insects of\nNewman's world---and insects they are indeed, as like to our own\nphysiologically as one mammal is to another---resemble much too closely\nspecific genre already found on Earth.\n\n\"And yet there can be no denying that the four species known to exist\n(interesting in itself, that there should be so few), date back in\ntheir respective habitats roughly 95 million years.  Fossil remains\nhave been found, and their location and carbon dating signaled back to\nus.  Unfortunately, no first-hand data is available, as the only two\nexploration parties ever to brave the hostile environs did not return.\n\n\"But from what they were able to gather and send back, we are given a\npicture both intriguing and disquieting.  By far the most interesting\nnews comes from the last report of the British expedition, only hours\nbefore all contact was lost.  One of their young behavioral scientists,\nconcentrating on the 'Stoors' of the equatorial regions (large,\nforaging creatures most nearly resembling the warrior ant,\napproximately 1.5 meters in length), was able to observe a gathering of\nseveral colonies around a single, great stone, possibly a meteorite, in\nthe center of a deep cloven valley.  He reports that the various\ngroups, distinguished by dots and splotches of color on the head and\nabdomen, continued to stream in from all directions for nearly two\nhours, apparently taking no notice of his hovering cruiser.  And when\nthey had swelled to perhaps five thousand, they locked forelegs\ntogether into countless, concentric circles around the stone and began\nto chant, though by rights they should have been able to make no such\nsound.  Mitchell Collins, the observer, reported that he was not sure\nwhether it was, in fact, a physical sound, or one that came to him\nthrough his mind only.  He further states that the precise movements\nand ritualistic nature of the gathering suggested some kind of\nprimitive religious ceremony.\n\n\"This last observation, of course, remains purely subjective.\"\n\n\n\n---Dr. Charles LeDoux, planetary biologist, to a meeting\nof the United French Scientists Guild.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nNaik Shannon had never heard of Newman's world, or if he had, the\nmemory lay buried too deeply.  And at the moment, he had other things\non his mind.  The survivors of the Marcum-Lauries colonies, his present\ncharge, were scattered and in disarray.  His own ship was too badly\ndamaged to lend assistance; he was running with a price on his head;\nand of his own forces perhaps a hundred still lived.\n\nShin, his second in command, had radioed that he was trying to gather\nsufficient escort from the remnants of the fleet to take the civilian\nships to safety in Soviet Space.  Where the others had turned in the\nwake of the dismal defeat he could not guess.  His head was pounding\nand he felt old and though he wanted to it was hard to care.  Never had\nhe felt so helpless.\n\nAfter the death of the ore-planet the Canton assault had been swift and\noverpowering.  The Laurian wings had fought well enough, considering\ntheir numbers and outdated equipment.  But they were no match for the\ngrim machination thrown against them.  He had seen almost at once how\nthe battle would go.  But while there was any chance at all.....\n\nThe red-brown planet loomed closer.  It had a somewhat ominous look:\nthe knotted lacing of deep-cut ravines, the jagged mountains, so\nmassive their outlines were visible even from here.\n\nTHEY ALL LOOK STARK AND ALIEN AT FIRST.   But this one was something\npeculiar, no denying.  Almost it had an aura of strangeness.  If he\nhadn't been so desperately short of oxygen he might have kept\nsearching.....  For a moment he had forgotten the Cantons.\n\nAgain he studied the star system readout on the ship's console,\nswitched to the more detailed graphic of Centaurus III, Newman's\nPlanet.  Touching the fingerboard, he summoned all the relevant data\nhis computer possessed.  The cursor darted back and forth across the\nscreen.\n\n\n                                        Centaurus III\n\n                                diameter:                 16,000 kil\n                                gravity:                 .6 relative\nEarth\n                                atmos density:         .4 relative Earth\n                                CO2                         72.1\n                                O2                         19.4\n                                N                         5.2\n                                CH4                        3.0\n                                Trace                        .3\n                                temp: \n                                120 to 35F                 tropic\n                                100 to 20F                 sub tropic\n                                70 to -15F                 up mid latitude\n                                30 to -90F                 polar sub pol\n                                wind:                         5 to 220 kph\n                                humid:                 .15 to .02 relative\nEarth\n                                flora:                         positive\n                                fauna:                         probable\n\n\nHe read the last line over, took a deep breath.  There were some fears\none never fully overcame.\n\nNot that Fear stood large in his mind---seventy Earth years were enough\nto teach him how meaningless that word was in the end.  Fear of death\nwas not only something he had never known, but something he had never\nunderstood in others.  His Cherokee blood, perhaps.  He did not dread\nit.  Now, more and more he almost welcomed death, so long as it was\nhonorable and not cheap.\n\nBut this was pointless.  He had to decide on an entry and find a place\nto land, and hope his breathing mask could make something of the\nstrange planet's 'air'.  Then take on as much oxygen as possible.\nThen.  What?\n\nGO BACK AND FIGHT THEM AGAIN.  He was tired.\n\nSimin crawled out from the heart of the stone, upwards through the long\ncarven tunnel.  Coming to a meeting of ways met a brother, touched\nantennae lightly---vibrations in the sky - yes brother I will come.\nFollowed twice left and right outward toward the canyon.  The way grew\nwider, more brothers, out into the serrated caves opening far above the\nvalley, came to the broad ledge.  As one the heads of twenty mai rose\nto watch the yellow flame descending.  Touch---as before---moved to\nlook out from the rim of the ledge, front legs suspended in the air.\nThe shell was landing in a wide plain among the hills beyond the\nvalley, at the foot of the Mountains of Teeth.\n\nJoining.\n\nAs before - down from the sky - bright flame, shell - two legs - I do\nnot know brother.  Summon queen, others - not yet I think.  But we must\n- brought to us - gods - no, too small - perhaps this one is different.\n Must act as one - yes, as one - I think it is so.  Yes brothers, I\nwill go.\n\n*\n\n\nShannon opened the hatch and looked out, long white hair pushed back as\nthe wind swept past his hawk nose and weathered features.  His face was\nred as brick.  Intense, steel-gray eyes looked straight ahead.\n\nScattered patches of some yellow-brown foliage skirted the edges of red\nstone that rippled up in curving waves from the dark and rocky soil.\nBefore him lay the rock-strewn plain, beyond it long low hills.  He had\npurposely avoided the shadowy chasm beyond.  The sky was pale gold, to\nauburn at the edges.\n\nThere had not been enough oxygen left for him to wait long inside the\nship.  The air-lock stood closed behind him.  It was a naked feeling as\nhe took those first breaths, sounding loudly through the intake bars of\nthe mask.  ALL RIGHT?  It didn't taste just right, but the indicator on\nhis sleeve showed green:  sufficient oxygen, negligible poison.  He\nfelt restless.  He crossed over the lip of the threshold, and descended\nthe perforated steps.\n\nFooting immediately around the landing site was difficult, as he moved\nout several paces to look back at the mountains unobstructed.  The\nrising sun had just cleared a high gap between them, and its shadow of\nlight crept slowly down their shoulders.\n\nHe felt emotion stir inside him.  Like stark and stalwart horns they\nrose to their impossible heights, almost vertical.  Of what stone they\nhad been forged to so withstand the wind and weathering he could not\nguess.  Like jagged pillars that would not die.  The warrior's heart\nwithin him flamed.\n\nFeeling some presence, he turned back to face the plain.  Something was\nmoving toward him.  Distance defied close description; but the shape of\nthe body and the nature of its movements did not at first imply\nintelligence.  But he knew better than to form such judgments.  It\nmoved openly, tactlessly toward him. He felt no fear.\n\nBut as it drew steadily on, he felt the sudden shock of recognition.\nThis was no slow, cumbersome oddity.  It was an insect, nearly five\nfeet long.  Like but unlike a huge ant---it was flatter, more heavily\narmored, with creased edges and corners, not unlike the rock.  Crisp,\ntight-folded wings.  He turned back toward the ship, but there was\nstayed by the will of whatever it was that came forward.  He felt a\nsudden shame at his desire to run, and whirled angrily to face it, the\nlong knife (the only weapon he carried) in his hand.  With this action\nthe creature seemed pleased:  it wholly released its grip on his mind.\nIt continued to come on.\n\nStopping finally some eight meters in front of him, it raised its upper\nbody and addressed him.  He saw then the bright orange-yellow ring,\ndarkly filled, on the underside of its thorax.  He heard words in his\nmind, somehow in his native tongue.\n\n\"I am Simin.  We must fight, you and I.  I cannot let you live.  For\nthis is our world, and it is not our way.  But your death need not be\nwithout honor.  And if you fight well, it may be of greater worth than\nyou know.\"\n\nFor a moment the man stood disbelieving, incongruous.  Then,\n \n\"You will have to take me first!\" he cried, feeling yet again the fire\nthat was in him.\n\nThe drone gave way before him, moving to the more level ground a short\ndistance to one side.  Shannon wondered at this, since clearly it moved\namong the pebble-stones effortlessly, then realized also that his knife\nhad grown, or at least appeared to grow.  Its curved blade gleamed, two\nfeet long.  The creature was trying to even the odds.  But it fully\nmeant to kill him.  That he knew with equal certainty.\n\nThe two circled, then the mai advanced.  The man aimed a blow at the\nhead, but Simin rolled away beneath it.  Then rose and came closer.\n\n*\n\nThe man had fought well.  SO UNLIKE THE OTHERS.  That he possessed the\nheart of a soldier Simin had known from the first brief mind scan.  But\nnever would have guessed the size of it.  For it was easy to feel the\nvast deserts the man had already crossed, and the final defeat showed\nclearly in his eyes.  But still he fought on, for no other reason than\nthat his fierce spirit refused to be broken.  Paused before moving onto\nthe fallen body.\n\nCame forward, touched antennae to his temples, and drank deeply from\nthe streams of Shannon's life.  Then engulfed the top of the skull with\nmassive, bowed jaws and cracked, lifted away the cranium.  Slowly ate\nthe man's brain, taking with it the remainder of his memory.\n\nAlmost at once the change began to come over him.  Tingling, he backed\naway slowly on his hind legs.  At last the miracle had come.  He lifted\nhis head to the sky, and felt the transformation taking place.  The\nhard shell of his face softened, yielding gradually to a new shape:\nhawk nose, burning eyes.  White hair streamed back from the auburn\nface, hard-edged once more.  The huge protruding jaws remained.  His\nforward body was now nearly upright, like a mantis, but with stronger,\nmore flexible arms.  His mind was keen and sharp.\n\nHe turned back to face the mountains, felt the same fierce elation.\nAnd for a time he could not move or think for the wonder of it.  How\nhad he not felt it before.  For a time he could not move or think.....\n\nAt long length he turned and headed back to the place of his spawning\n---the Gorge.  The brothers, now forty, saw him reappear atop the high\nprecipice that loomed at the far side of the canyon.  They detected\nsome subtle change in him, though from that distance they could only\ndescry a somewhat more elevated form.  He did not come to them at once,\nbut stood looking down upon the stepped vastness, alone, as if seeing\nit for the first time.\n\nWhen at last he did spread his wings and fly closer they looked up at\nhim amazed, not understanding.  He landed on the ledge but remained at\nhis distance, regarding them quietly.  He addressed them, no longer\nneeding to touch.  His strange eyes shone and he did not move, as if\noverwhelmed from within.  He spoke to their minds.\n\n\"My time has come.  Summon the others.\"\n\nThey could not understand, but obeyed, dispersing to summon their\nqueen, and all others that lived within the span of their own.\n\n*\n\n\nThe sun tipped the horizon and dust was gathering and still the long\nfiles of mai continued to stream down.  Already the central basin was\nnearly filled, and pushing back toward the statued spires of the west\nwall.  The moving shapes were dark in the lengthening shadows, and all\nlooked up at him, perched silently atop the Carrier Stone.  The first\ncircle of seven queens, not touching, seemed to understand, as did the\ndrones behind them.  All others knew only that another Outsider had\nbeen killed.  Waited patiently for the joining.\n\nAs the darkness deepened and the last movement ceased, all joined and\nwere silent.  The queens approached the Stone, the giver of life, and\ntouched it.\n\nFrom out of its crumpled iron surface arose a faint hum, the remainder\nof its strength.  All lives were now fused, and the queens sent out\ntheir messages.  Joined forelegs and antennae, bent all their thought\ntoward Simin, so that now he probed the memory not with one mind but\nwith many.  And stimulated by the Carrier, its greatness began to come\nforth.\n\nSlowly the streams of Shannon's life broke free and flowed in a gentle\nmurmur through all, paced and given substance by the queens and drones.\n And slowly they took shape into music, a long, rhythmic chant.  Then\nwith gathering strength as a river fed by many tributaries, rose into\nsong that filled all the valley, and echoed in the hearts of ten\nthousand mai.  From birth to death, the long struggles of his life were\nplayed out, rising and falling like the seasons of the wind.  Again and\nyet again he did battle, with hope or without it.  The song grew within\nSimin, overpowering, so stark and beautiful that he thought he must\ndie, but knew he could not yet.\n\nThen all again was hushed, and stiffly the drone-that-was raised\nhimself up.  A voice rose out of his soul, but it was no longer his:  a\npulsing, soft white glow hovered in the air above him.\n\n\"They have called me a mercenary, but it is not so.  I am a warrior.\nFor be it my virtue or be it my curse, it has never been within me to\nyield to aggression, or to stand aside and let violence pass.\nSomething has always risen inside me when persecution, in any form, is\nat hand.  In this I claim no virtue, no heroism.  This only will I say:\n that I have ever given my strength to those unable to defend\nthemselves, the downtrodden, the weak, oppressed by the strong.  But\nmost bitter in my malice have always been those who kill in the name of\nGod, some higher purpose.  They are to me blindness and murder\npersonified.  Thus, I do not claim it.\n\n\"In twelve wars have I fought---in half as many victories.  For in time\nmy soldiering became no longer a conscious action, but an instinctive\nresponse.\n\n\"Well do I know my folly in choosing this bitter course.  But if I am\nto live, then it will be as a man.  And if by the loneliness that is my\nsoul I can turn aside the sword of injustice, even for a short time,\nthen so help me God I will do it.\"\n\nThe words ended and the glow receded.  It lived no more.  Again\nhimself, alone, Simin lowered his head, so deeply moved that the water\nflowed freely from his eyes.  The ruling queen approached him.\n\n\"Simin-that-was.  Do you take this Quest?\"\n\n\"I will take it, though I fear to falter.\"\n\n\"You will not.\"\n\nThe queen stepped back, and all proclaimed him.\n\n\"Si-mai, ungol, misch-naik!\"  AGAINST THE EVIL THAT WAS AND IS, WE SEND\nYOU.  The joining was ended, and the gathering dispersed.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nHe had flown for many days into the growing cold.  The sun was gone and\nthe wind was rising as he searched the ground below him for a place to\npass the night.  It must be sheltered, not so much from the elements\n(though this too was important) as from the marauding bands of ground\nwasps that lived in these northern regions.  There was still far to go\nand much danger ahead.  He had no strength for useless battles.\n\nAt last as all light faded he came upon a towering pillar of stone in\nthe midst of a vast wasteland, split at the top as if cloven by a giant\naxe.  Reaching its heights, he descended slowly into its broad\nembrasure.  Detecting some deeper shadow in the blackness of the\neastern wall, he flew toward a narrow fissure in the rock.  Landing\nsilently on the lip of it, he tested the air for vibrations.  All was\nstill.  He moved inside and huddled close together.  He was empty and\ncold and weary to the point of exhaustion.  He remained in quiet\nthought for many hours.\n\nWhen he had taken the quest, he knew only that he must somehow continue\nthe labors of Shannon's life---find some way to avenge the death of it.\n He had wandered alone for a period of days, remembering, until one\nmorning, at the rising dust of a fiery dawn, he had felt the North\ncalling to him.  He felt it still, though less strongly, and he deemed\nthat this was right.  What he hoped to find there he could not say.  He\nonly knew that he must find it.\n\nThe most difficult aspect of his journey thus far had not been the long\nflight on short provisions.  To the mai such things meant nothing.\nThey lived to work and serve the greater need, that was all.  No, it\nwas more the feelings and emotions that the long pilgrimage evoked in\nhim, seeming almost to rise from the vast loneliness of his world.  For\nthough the man's spirit had died or moved on, his sensations and\nexperience had not.  They lived on within Simin, and sometimes puzzled\nor even frightened him.  He understood, and knew this was necessary;\nbut the knowledge did not make it easier.\n\nWHAT A TORTURED RACE THEY MUST BE, he thought. SO TORN BETWEEN DESIRE\nAND FEAR.  THEY ARE GIVEN NO ROLE, NO CLEAR PLACE.  THEY MUST FIND IT,\nAS WE MUST FIND MOISTURE IN AN ARID LAND.\n\nIt was this fear of frustration and fruitless searching that he felt\nmost deeply, because it had for so long been a part of his own\nexistence.  Through all his twenty months he had sought after some\nintangible, some elusive quality of being, with no more guide than a\nrestless and smoldering hunger inside him.  TO NOT KNOW, really not\nknow who he was or where he was going.\n\nThis, he decided, must be the doom of humanity:  to be born a burning\nquestion of itself, a paradox of beauty and destruction, love and loss.\n To take personally and introspectively the irresolvable conflict of\nlife and desire over stillness and the void.  Again, he felt it so\ndeeply.  That the struggle could also be beautiful he knew.  But still,\nsuch a hard and lonely fate.....\n\nWhen dawn came he crawled out of the niche and looked about him.  The\ngreat crack was shadowed and still.  He felt the presence of many\ncreatures, but they were not yet near him.  The rockface offered little\nresistance as he climbed, and soon he stood atop a hooked spire that\nsprang from the pillar's crumbling eastern shoulder, high above the\nplain.  Two long lines of wingless wasps were mounting towards him.\nThe first of their number touched the spire.  He took one last taste of\nthe dawn, then flew out beyond their reach.\n\nHe flew staunchly and steadily northward, now that he had some plan.\nFor the clarity of first-sun had told him what he must do.  Stopping to\nrest along the top of a shallow ridge, he ate part of a darkening\nbush-bulb, nearly as large as himself.  Its taste was bitter, but it\ngave him strength.  Then he set out again.\n\nHis mind had determined to search the farthest North.  Shannon's memory\ntold him what he might find there:  great frozen wastes of ice and\nearth, underground hollows left from times when the water had been\ngreater.  Sometimes as he pondered these, at the edge of thought he\nwould feel a sound, a sensation: deep throbbings in empty places\nbeneath the ground, a golden light that drew him onward.  But then it\nwould vanish and leave him, wondering.  He must find its source, if it\nwere real.\n\nThree days more he journeyed toward it, till on the fading edge of the\nthird the wind forced him to land.  It had been gathering strength\nsince the morning of the spire, and now carried with it a bitter and\nbiting cold that would not rest.  His strength beginning at last to\nfail him, he determined to go on on foot, until he found some shelter,\nor a reason to stop.  He felt the presence of no other creature, yet\nstill he was uneasy.  He had reached the edge of the mighty tundra that\nformed the cap of Newman's world.\n\nNow more and more he reached into Shannon's past, trying to find the\nthing that had kept him going.  Genuine physical weakness, other than\nsimple hunger, thirst and fatigue, was something he had never known,\nand dealing with it frustrated all the lessons he had learned as a mai.\n Being alien to his experience, he had assumed that it did not\nexist---that there was only weakness of will, and that so long as his\ndesire held, no barrier of the flesh would ever stop him.  This lesson\nin perspective he accepted, though grudgingly.  It seemed that\neverything he had known in three seasons of life must be relearned,\naltered to fit this new reality.  But his will remained undaunted.\n\nHe traveled many hours into the darkness of night, until he found a\nsmall hollow of earth and root of stone at the base of a pummeled and\nwind torn boulder.  A thin lacing of ground-snow, carried by the wind,\nswirled around him and whistled in its cracks, making a melancholy\nsound that he felt still deeper for the lassitude of his body.  Here he\nrested, and tried not to think, until the coming of morning.\n\nThe morning was much the same as the night, with only a patchy gray\nlight to tell him when the day had come.  He moved out of the shelter\nand walked, across shallow hills, rising in monotonous rhythm through a\nbleak and barren landscape.  The earth was a dull and frozen brown,\nbroken now and again by rock, or gnarled scrub, or nothing.  The thin\nsnow blew over all, trailing and whirling about in long wisps like the\ntwisting hands of witches.  He continued on for many hours, until the\nwind relented just long enough for him to exhaust himself in flight.\nHe landed again, and found the earth covered intermittently with thin\npatches of ice, sometimes deepening and joining together into shrunken,\nunmoving streams, or withered oak leaves of many fingers.\n\nHe continued and night came again but he did not stop.  He had eaten\nwhat hard and knotted brush he could find, and there was now no lack of\nmoisture; and though it was his mind he feared, denying it had not yet\nbecome unbearable.  He rested a short time, went on the next day. And\nthe next, walking because he could not fly, into the growing cold, and\nthicker snow, and ice that began to dominate the ground.  Until he was\nalone.\n\nTime passed.\n\n*\n\n\nHe had reached the farthest North.  The world was ice, layered with\nsnow.  The wind blew the white softness above into dunes, sometimes\nfoaming against islands of rock, huddled together in groups or\nbranching straight like disjointed coral reefs, while its gusting\nblasts wrapped veils over all, swirling and howling in relentless\ndefiance.  The day lasted but four short hours, then all was swathed in\ndarkness, so that the swirling sheets were blind and crashed over him\nlike spray of drowning surf on the deck of a floundering ship.  He was\nutterly alone.\n\nSimin's strength was gone; he did not know what kept him going.\nPerhaps because he had never known defeat.....  But surely it was more.\n Through the numb slowness of his near-frozen body a heart beat that\ncarried no blood.  He was dangerously crippled by the cold.\n\nHe had passed wide cracks in the ice, chasms and fissures that he knew\nmust lead down:  sometimes he could almost see, or sense, uncovered\nearth or the edges of rock far below.  And this was what he sought.\nBut always the feel of them was cold.  He sought an entrance, which led\nto a passage.  He must find it soon or perish.\n\nOn the seventh day since entering the tundra, an hour after the\ndisappearing of light, a vast abyss opened before him, wider and\nemptier and deeper than any he had yet come across.  Like a crushed\ncylinder of otherworldly proportions, it yawned directly in front of\nhim, dropping deep into the earth.  His forelegs hovered trembling\nabove the void.\n\nThis must be the passage, or he would die.  He no longer trusted his\njudgment; it had fallen in the snow many miles behind him.  It could\nwell be madness, but he felt a presence far below, some wild hope.....\nNo.  He must find shelter.  Perhaps it was there.  A shelter.  If he\ncould find it.  MUST CONTINUE ON.  NO, HERE.  IT MUST BE HERE, OR I AM\nDYING.  SO. . .EASY TO SURRENDER.  LIKE FALLING ASLEEP.  LETTING GO.\nNO!\n\nHe turned his sinking body around, and forced it to descend:  hooking\nand digging, scraping into ice, forelegs stretched to the limit, trying\nnot to slip.  To slip was death.  Down.  Down farther.  A little\nfarther.  THE WIND IS LESS HERE.  Here.  KEEP MOVING.  MUST KEEP\nMOVING.  NO STRENGTH. . .BUT WARMTH COMING BACK.  YES, WARMTH.  MOVE.\nFARTHER.\n\nDON'T SLIP!  DON'T SLIP.  An overhang.  CAREFUL.  MUST STRUGGLE PAST\nSOMEHOW.  SOME WAY.  PAST.  WARMTH.  IT MUST BE WARMER.  KEEP MOVING.\nIT WILL BE WARMER, OR I AM DYING.  I AM DYING.  IT IS WARMER.\n\nAfter the long and grueling climb, stopping many times to marshal\nstrength, he found himself at the bottom.  The cylinder had narrowed,\nso that now it was scarcely thirty meters broad, a sharp cleft of\nstone, rising  sheer into ice that overtook it for perhaps a thousand\nmeters more.  He rested there, his body pulsing, spent.  The cold was\nnot as intense, and the wind was less, and the movement had warmed his\nlimbs.\n\nBut he was weak and near dead from hunger and exhaustion.  He needed\nsustenance badly, soon.  Or it was over.  He moved to a tiny pool of\nsnow that had formed from a trickle of the torrent above, and with his\ntrembling foreclaw worked small bits of it into his mouth.  All done in\npitch darkness, and very little feeling left.  Then moved to examine\nthe corners of the cleft.\n\nThe first was blocked, solid stone.  He turned about.  He did not know\nhe had reached the opposite wall until he passed through it, was\ninside.  A cave had opened blindly and taken him in, narrow and not\nhigh, but a cave nonetheless.  A passage.  After a time he knew\ninstinctively that he was underground, but was far too weary for the\nknowledge to have much effect.  He continued forward.  He must find\nsome kind of sustenance.  Sustenance.  He thought of his foreclaw, but\nremembering the man.....  No.  Not yet.\n\nHe wandered on, stumbling, raising himself up to go on.  Plodded\nforward, sinking ever deeper, and onward, until the air around him\nsuddenly grew larger.  A loosened rock rolled off another, and the echo\ndid not return for some time.  He moved to his right, sensing\nsomething, and stroked the tip of his claw against the slanting surface\nwhich met it.  The surface was sometimes soft and not smooth; it was\nnot part of the stone.  He tried to break off a small piece.  The layer\nwas thin, and it crumbled.  He tried again, brought the wretched\nsubstance---some kind of dried blood, or excrement---to his mouth.  Its\ntaste was bile and bitter and acid.  Then swallowed.  Throat burning,\nhe repeated the motion perhaps a dozen times, then collapsed, half\nholding, to the floor.  And lay unmoving.\n\n\n*\n\n\nSimin woke from his delirium many hours later, somewhat stronger, but\nstill dizzy and confused.  The little nourishment he had taken lifted\nhis mind back to awareness, strong, if subtly altered by the thick aura\nof the place, and by the strange and pressing reality of his quest.  He\nrose slowly, careful not to spend the wavering hope he had found, and\nlooked around him.\n\nLooked around him.  There was a dim light in that place, that region of\nvastness.  And whatever the source, though all before had been\ndarkness, it was undeniable.  The light was dim and surreal, softly\nyellow and fallow gold, but nonetheless afforded him a glimpse of this\nunderground world, if it did not end, which he must now traverse.  For\nhere, more than ever, he sensed a presence that was greater than his\nown life, if distantly, not calling him but aware of his need.\n\nStrangeness.\n\nHe was not alone in that ribbed, spine-ceilinged enclosure.  Around a\nfar turning he caught movement, and was sure as an ebb and flow motion\nof body and legs rounded the inward corner that was the edge of his\nsight.  He was still too weak to fight, or to go on, as the many legged\ncreature approached him blindly, unaware of his presence.  It drew\ncloser, then seemed to slow in its movements, coming gradually to a\nhalt.  Descendant of the centipede, it studied him from a distance of\nforty meters, its poisoned forward spikes twitching with unease.\n\nThough the centipede was longer, its bulk and his were nearly equal.\nHe had no strength for a fight, nor did he seek one.  But perhaps his\nquivering opponent could be daunted, backed down.  Yet as he continued\nto watch he felt no aggression, only puzzlement, coming from the other:\n He was not part of its food chain, nor was its territory threatened.\nIt was only frightened, why so strongly he could not guess.  He also\nknew, with sudden sureness, that it was one of many.  Somehow he knew.\nHe took a step forward, and it retreated swiftly along the way it had\ncome, moving onto the wall, perhaps instinctively, where it felt a\ngreater measure of safety.  He followed it as best he could in the half\nlight, the flexing striped-brown body, hoping to find the source of its\nfood.\n\nHe passed the narrowing corner at the back of the high, curving chamber\nand descended a long, often twisting, downward tunnel that branched off\nfrom it.  The other's speed was considerable, moving through the\nregions of its birth, and try as he might he could not keep up.  He\nsoon found himself alone in a roughly spherical vault, not large, with\nfive knife-slash passages opening off it.\n\nThe light here was thicker, and in a swift moment of recognition he\nrealized the reason for it.  The soft glow was neither greater nor\nweaker anywhere around him:  it did not have a true source, nor did it\ncast a single shadow.  He felt a slight pulsing of moisture across his\nface, like a fine drizzle-rain touched by the wind.  The light was in\nthe mist itself.  Also, there was the sensation of his flesh lightly\ntouching, warming against the inner edges of his armor.  His senses\nwere heightened, and he was acutely aware of his hunger.\n\nHis antennae began to twitch, almost without his knowledge, turning him\nto the left.  He followed to a shallow rift at the lowest point of the\nenclosure, where he found a tiny pool of dark water, sponged by a thick\nand brackish black algae.  He immersed his jaws and tasted.  Again.  He\nfilled his mouth, and painfully swallowed wave after wave of the wet\nand mud sustenance.\n\nThen he backed away and lifted himself up, feeling alive once more.  He\nmoved to hide himself behind a jagged plate of rock, and waited for his\nstrength to return.\n\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nSimin stood before the flat porous surface of a section of a wall of\nstone.  The pale light which illuminated it was the same as ever,\nperhaps a little brighter, or his eyes had dulled in growing used to\nit.  But through the worn blankness of his mind (though a fair measure\nof his physical strength had returned, yet having no will to drive it)\nhe felt a spark of emotion, almost human, that held him there with a\nhollow aching in the center of his chest.  He stood before a fading\nportrait, a mark left on the uncaring stone.\n\nAt his feet lay the scattered and broken armor, all that remained, of\nanother who had tried.  This melancholy work, drawn in the creature's\nown browning blood and severed foreclaw, had been its death-act of\nremembrance, its struggle still to forge some meaning from the\nemptiness of its failure.  It had not been mai---he knew from the\nbroken shell and the drawing---and this more than anything else,\nthundered shame at his growing feelings of surrender and despair.  He\nremained silent, head down, wrapped in rage.  At length he looked up to\nstudy the creature's last act of flesh.\n\nIt was the image, subtly changed, of a winged chivit, roaming insects\nliving to the south of the mai.  The outlines of its frame, like the\nedges of a fisherman's net, were opened at the center of the body and\njoined shut at the limbs and single arching wing.  Its left foreleg and\nright hind (it had only four digits in all) extended from the main in\nalmost Egyptian caricature, drawn with a trembling hand.  The effect of\nthe whole was that of a shriveled and shrunken Phoenix, macabrely\nadorning the tomb of some lost pharaoh. Subtly changed, like\nhimself.....  But the thing that held him---one strange detail.  A\nsmoky blur emanated outward from the body, like Spirit growing out of\nflesh.  A fearful banshee image, or dying vision of the Life After?\nThe long journey.\n\nAura.\n\nBreaking away at last he continued downward, seeking the source of the\nlight, finding passages as best he could.  He tried to read what signs\nthere were, the faint flux of incandescence, feeling called but never\nsure, taking what nourishment he could, for three days more.  Always\nthe strange tingling of flesh against his armor increased, as did\ninternal body heat.  And ever as he went he came across more of the\nstriped-brown creatures, male centipedes, some running it seemed, from\nwhat he could not guess, all fearing him, all bearing the marks of\nbattle.  Yet none were ever wounded to the point of near-death, and all\nappeared strong of their kind.  It was a puzzle he could not dissect.\nTheir fear held his confidence, but drawing steadily downward, he felt\na growing reluctance to trespass the source of their being.  It seemed\nto contradict all fairness that the way which led to meaning, if it\ndid, lay through a world of savage (of this he was also quite sure),\nsniveling insects, who had in no way raised themselves above the\nanimal.  They were mindless and ugly, and his distaste for them would\nnot be abated.  Fatigue, too, was becoming unbearable, as the invisible\nforce that beat back on him, assaulting both mind and body, continued\nto grow with the light which was its sister sun.\n\nOn the fourth day, though time meant little in that place, passing only\nin the world outside, he discovered the reason for his revulsion.  The\ndull, scraping sounds of armor against stone, of multitudes locked in\nbattle, had caught first at the edge of hearing, seeming unreal, then\nsteadied, held, and increased as he went on.  Till coming to the\nfissure-like opening of yet another vast cavern, he looked down on a\nsight that twisted his spirit like rope and squeezed hard at the knots.\n Some twenty meters below him, as it were through a glassless window,\nhe saw and understood at last the riddle of these pathetic creatures.\n\nNewly hatched---the broken, swollen webs of multiple cocoons lay many\nlayers deep all around them---they were locked into countless battling\npairs.  Each separate fight was to the death, the victor sometimes\nstopping to eat a part of the vanquished, gaining strength, then moved\non to grapple with others who had yet survived.  By such attrition\ntheir numbers had already been reduced from thousands to hundreds, to\nwhat end he could not imagine.\n\nThen he saw the females.  Huge and bloated, they sat complacently on\nraised vantage points at the margins of the battlefield, awaiting the\nfinal conquerors.  These victors he knew, from the signs he had already\nseen, would mate with them and then be cast out, possibly eaten, left\nto die as they would, the reason for their brief, wretched lives\nextinguished.\n\nHe watched them in dull horror, growing to intense pity and disgust.\nFor he knew that what he sought lay beyond them, and that its power,\nfor good or ill, had nothing to do with them, and no influence\nwhatever, either to elevate or corrupt.  They were only here, and\nthrough some flaw of intelligence, or heart, or having no choice, they\nlived and died in a meaningless haste of reproduction.\n\nHe must past through them.  He waited as long as his patience would\nhold, away from the window, not watching.  When he looked in again many\nhours later, the number of fighting pairs had been reduced to perhaps\nsixteen.  He crawled in through the high opening, moved carefully down\nthe back-leaning arc of wall and onto a level with the combatants, all\nunnoticed.  A narrow wrinkle in the chamber, nearly flat at the base,\nran like a sunken path before him, dividing the battle in half.  Having\nno choice, he began to walk the shallow gauntlet, moving stiffly,\nalways ready for a fight.\n\nFirst one pair and then another released their grip as they saw him,\nconfused.  Some, already on the verge of death, lay writhing and\nlegless, fighting still.  The four queens, each from its raised\npedestal, looked on in disbelief: their sacred ritual had been\ndisturbed.  Simin moved steadily forward, staring down and backing off\neach male as he passed.  He was nearly halfway through.\n\nFinally one of the females raised up her forward body, and began moving\nit back and forth like an impatient cobra.  The male closest to her\n---it seemed to Simin the largest he had seen---broke away and came\nforward, moving toward the dry canal where the intruder stood waiting.\n\nUnlike the others it showed no outward fear.  It advanced without\nhesitation, or thought, or much of anything except the blind mating\naggression of its kind.  It stopped only once, looking back at the\nfemale from the lip of the sunken path, then came forward with only one\nimpulse in its mind.  Kill him.\n\nSimin had only a short time to plan his fight.  As the creature drew\nnearer he opened his wings instinctively and strafed the air with his\nforeclaws.  His wings!  In all the time since finding the abyss he had\nforgotten them, first from the weak amnesia of near-death, then from\nsimple disuse.  With no more time to marvel he moved in a quick\nhalf-circle to avoid the lumbering bulk, then flitted up behind it onto\nthe slanting edge of the rift.  These short bursts of flight he\nrepeated several times (the thought that he could fly to safety and\nforget this fight never occurred to him), searching for a weakness.\nThough filled with a sullen rage, he knew there could be no mistakes.\nRising higher, he hovered briefly above his baffled foe, then swept\ndown onto its back, and in three quick motions of jaws and foreclaw,\ntore off its head and left it to die.\n\nStill full of bitter and unused anger he landed again on the plain\nclosest to the female, clawing the rock as if clinging to a rope, as\nhis blurring wings drummed threateningly.  Then letting go he flew\ndirectly over her, and left the sorry massacre behind.\n\nWith this action his patience expired.  Landing as the far side of the\nchamber grew shallow, he walked on through a curving length of tunnel\nfor some miles, until confronted by a three-directional branching of\nthe passageway.  He followed the right-hand way first, and for a short\ntime made good progress.  But then it doubled back on him and finally\nended, died, into a narrowing of stone through which he could not pass.\n Furious, he worked his way back to the starting point, taking this\ntime the central shaft, leading downward.  The result was the same,\nthough it took him much longer to realize.  Returning again to the\nmeeting of ways was now difficult, since in his haste he had been\nforced to take and re-take several turns in a compact but puzzling\nlabyrinth, that he found in the end took him nowhere.\n\nComing again after many hours to the branching of paths, he tried to\nrest both mind and body, conceding the inevitable.  His anger here was\nuseless.  It had only robbed him of strength and precious time, and he\nwas no closer to a resolution of his bitter quest than he had ever\nbeen.  And also, a peculiar yellow fear, such as he had seldom\nexperienced in his life, was beginning to grow in him.  At first he\nblamed himself, raging.  But walking through the twisted tunnels of the\nlabyrinth he had realized, suddenly, that it was not his fear alone.\nHis body was still not right, if wrong in a way that was hard to\ndefine, and there could be but one explanation for it.  The mist, the\ngrowing light, was affecting his altered physiology.  He searched\nwithin himself, bewildered, till Shannon's memory put a name to it.\nRADIATION.  A force that should not affect an insect, but which worked\non those parts of his body that were yet human.\n\nHe rested for a time, but his rest was brief.  The feelings of unease\ncontinued to grow in him; they would not be contained.  The source of\nwhat he sought---he could now feel a faint throbbing in the stone\naround him---was a danger in itself, repulsing, even as it called to\nhim.  He must find it quickly, then be gone.  For he knew that his time\nin those depths was limited.  He gathered what courage and presence of\nmind he could, then pushed on, entering the left-hand passage.\n\nHe summoned now all his underground instincts, honed by the long\ndelvings of his life among the mai.  In those days, a constant stream\nunbroken by sleep, he had endlessly searched out tunnels untraveled or\nlong forgotten, returning ever and again to those that went deepest,\nlearning the mazes, delving deeper still.  Though what he sought there\nhe could not have said.\n\nThe left-hand way was subtle, as he passed onward through the narrow\nstone, with many turnings and side passages.  He held mostly to the\nmain shaft, learning its direction, following it on its slow, steady\ncourse downward.  Many times it narrowed, till he was ready to despair.\n But always through perseverance and careful backtracking, he was able\nto find a way through.\n\nThe narrowing and tight touching of the walls began to frighten him.\nBy this, more than any other token, he knew that the growing fear\ninside him was not solely his own.  Far back in the journey he had\nrealized that\nin taking the quest he must know, in part, what it was to be human.\nPerhaps the spirit of Shannon still lived more strongly than he knew.\nAnd perhaps there were others as well.  Often he had thought with human\nvoice, human words, till now it was impossible to separate the two.  He\nhad known, and been, emotions that were not his own.....\n\nBut THIS fear.  Sometimes from the deeps of his mind he could hear a\nhowling as of many tormented voices, rising out of him like a driven,\nheart-frozen wind.\n\nHe stopped.  He himself was afraid, and he did not know why.  He must\nmaster it and go on.  He must master it and go on.  Go on.....\nResistance was thick around him, his body's weakness, till he felt that\nin standing still he walked against a current of water.\n\nHe hardened, and went forward.  The passage began to open again,\ngrowing wider.  Several more of the branching ways, through a mesh of\nstone, and a straight, subtly rising tunnel lay before him.  Far off in\nthe distance he heard, unmistakably, a steady throbbing, echoing like a\nfall of water---the deep, rapid pulsing of a heart.  He pushed on,\nharder, though the pulsing of yellow light grew stronger, pushing back\non him, darkening to gold, an airless wind urging him back.\n\nThe passage seemed endless, and still it went on, with no\nindication.....   Ahead of him, the tunnel opened out, almost beyond\nthe edge of sight.  He continued.  Farther.  He had reached it:  the\nhorn's spout.  Over the lip, and in.....\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe beginnings of the chamber greeted him like an opened book, lying on\nits bindings, leaning downward.  The rock of that flattened wedge,\nangling slowly away from him, was ribbed and strangely\nsymmetrical---smooth porous gray, but bathed in a strong golden light,\ninexplicably tinged dark crimson where it met a rise of stone.  He was\nonly vaguely aware that beyond this antechamber the ceiling warped high\nand huge, above a valley that dwarfed even the place of his birth.  For\nhere, as nowhere else beneath the surface of his world there were\nshadows, lengthening toward him to either side of the shallow, widening\nstaircase.  And for all the desperate haste of his journey, Simin could\nnot yet go forward.  He stood looking down at the two pillared\nsentinels in awe, the vast spherical expanse beyond.  He little thought\nthat he himself, standing before the rim of the long tunnel he had just\ntraversed, his upper body and underside wreathed in red, formed an\nequally stunning and unlikely visage of life against the Void.\n\nAssimilation.\n\nTwo stone sentinels stood in perfect symmetry, like Roman statues, atop\nthe angling walls that rose to either side of the stairway's end.  The\nsunken plain lay beyond.  Whether these silent watchers had been carved\nby Nature or intelligence it was impossible to say:  perhaps meant to\nconnote angry, reptilian merman rising out of the stone, perhaps\nroughly shaped bodies whose accidental carving held no meaning at all.\nHere all boundary between the spiritual and the meaningless faded.\nThey stood silent, faces outward, guarding the plain below.  He\ndescended slowly until he stood between them, on the ripple of stone\nlooking down.\n\nThe plain lay before him like a massive wrinkled dish, bone-white and\nbarren.  He breathed deeply several times, not knowing why.  His\nobjective was a clear as the tolling of a bell.\n\nA broad crater rested in the center of all, sinking out of sight, and\nfrom it came the deep tremor of sound, the slow throbbing of light that\npervaded the underground vastness with its certain and unnerving\npresence.  Everywhere the edges of floor and ceiling glowed red, as if\nfrom heat, and the brightness of yellow gold folded over and through\nhim like a liquid current of sun and air, warming.  Simin had not the\nheart to remain there long; he must descend now, or turn back in\ndefeat.  This place was the very nexus of his unspoken fears.\n\nHe descended into the Valley, and almost at once the wailing of\nhuman voices erupted in his ears, rising and falling in a discordant\nterror of mutilated passions, scales without notes or boundaries.  He\nmoved on, oblivious, physically incapable of dealing with this fear.\nHis weakness cried out strange horrors; his strength was confused.\n\nHe continued, not knowing what else to do.  The surface of that plain\nwas cracked and uneven---warm, and unbearably long.  The cacophony of\nhuman fears climbed and fell back, rising now as if engulfed in flame,\nthen chilled, despairing.\n\nHUMAN FEAR.  At last he understood.  He felt the presence of other\nminds so strongly that he wondered if Shannon were truly dead, and not\nmerely the emissary of human suffering and grief.  For this, surely,\nwas an unearthly place of His world.  The high ceiling, the infinite,\ntrackless waste.  The heat.  Words raced through his beleaguered body,\nslowing, till with a dread he would not have thought possible.....  The\nvoice of a weary, tortured old man, his spirit broken in the end---a\nJew, his lungs filled with poison---formed physically, undeniable, in\nhis ears.\n\n\"Inferno.\"\n\nHe stopped, as if a razor had cloven him in two.  It was there before\nhim, all around.  He could not go forward, or back.  He was dying.\nYes, dying in that place, where the river of his dreams, fallen to a\ntrickle, had at last died into unconquerable sand.  He stood frozen in\nterror.  To breathe was a pointless misery.  There was\nnothing---alone---in that hollow place but death.\n\nHe knew not where he got the strength, or desperation.  He lifted the\nfirst of his walking legs, moved it forward.  It touched the ground, a\nlittle farther ahead.  He moved the next, and then the next.  He\nstaggered forward, feeling a will such as he had never known hardening\nout of his weakness and despair.  He was terrified, in pain.  Burning\nwith fever.  But he moved.\n\nWith this action the resistance seemed to falter, the wailing of human\npassions to subside.  But only for a moment.  They redoubled their\nassault---the current against him was physical---but broke against his\nstubborn movement like a wall of water against stone.  He continued.\nThe sand of many hours flowed past him.\n\nHe was nearing the crater, now certain he would die.  If only by his\ndeath he could achieve for Shannon, and for the other.....  He forced a\nforeclaw to shackle the edge of the crater, looking down.  Determined.\nThe dry heat of that place was unbearable; and still distance defied\nhim.  A silver-white core, cruel mockery of the Carrier stone, glowed\nat the center of the broken-rock pit.  From within came the voices, the\nfever, the Heat.  Yet this was his only quest.  He must. . .TOUCH\nit.....  Must.\n\nHe could not walk; his legs would no longer carry him.  With a weak\nspasm of his hind and a pathetic flutter of wings, he pushed himself\nover the edge and slid, rolled across stones, folding his wings just in\ntime, to tumble down a steep slope then land, legs folded beneath him\ngripping hot stones, perhaps a hundred yards from all his desire.\n\nHe welcomed now its death, if only he could move.  If only he could go\nthat distance farther, against the barrage.  Of distance.  But he was\nafraid.  Afraid to die.  To die!  At last he had met the greatest human\nfear:  the wakened animal, knowing it would live no more.\n\nOh, it was too much.  He steeled the fire in his heart and went on, but\nwould have screamed if he could.  Fifty yards.  Forty.  It was too\nmuch.  Too much.  The stones beneath him rasped and hissed, speaking\nDeath's name.  Downward, into the final hole of death, the murderer of\nall his passions.  It was too much.  What kind of God would ask.....\nToo much.\n\nHis death reached out.  He touched the stone.\n\n\n*\n\n\nHe touched the stone.  Slowly the feverish weakness left him, as if a\nviolent storm fading at the last.  The human flesh, the human trial,\nhad left him.  There was only Simin, and he was one.\n\nThe Stone, which had appeared to burn white-hot, was cool, and he\nexperienced a sense of tranquility such as he had never known.  He had\ndone it.  The spirit of Shannon was at peace.\n\nHis mind was calm, his own.  He remained, outstretched foreclaws\ntouching this new life, where death had been certain.  His inner being\nwas like the quiet surface of a pool.  A tiny pebble fell into it, and\nas the ripples smoothed outward and the settled stone touched bottom,\nhe understood.\n\n\"It is a strange truth that the path to beauty and meaning often lies\nthrough fear and ugliness.\"  After a time another part of his being\nadded this.  \"God may exist; at times I feel him.  Yet we must walk\ndark paths alone, and endure.\"\n\nHe remained there in silent thought for some time, until at length he\nturned and made his way back toward the tunnels, knowing now with\ncertainty what he must do.  His mind possessed new powers, because it\nwas one with the Unnamable.  His armor was many times stronger.\n\nHe knew what he must do.\n\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nIt was irony, perhaps, but also a shrewd tactical maneuver on the part\nof Shin il Sung, that brought the Laurian refugees to Hegel V, the\nremote Canton mining planet.  Limping toward Soviet Space with a\npatchwork of seventeen ships, Shannon's second-in-command had hoped at\nfirst that that the fascist armada, which had paused for two weeks to\nregroup and consolidate its victory (whatever that might be, as the\ncolonies they attacked had been largely destroyed), would at least\nallow them to escort the civilian carriers unharmed.  But when the\nfanned out cluster of ships began to appear again on laser detection,\nmockingly unconcealed, he knew that he hoped in vain.  Their enemies\ncould leave no honest witness to the massacre.\n\nShin's own trail would be more difficult to follow, but he knew that in\nthe end they would be found, long before the countless miles had been\ncrossed.  Sheer distance made this part of the galaxy anarchic.\n\nThere would be no help from beyond.  The Soviets, with their usual\npragmatism, had said a polite no to his request for protective escort,\neven hospital and civilian ships for the wounded, and the women and\nchildren.  It was clear that they were taking a larger view of the\nconflict, hoping to turn it later to their own advantage, which made\nthe lives of a few thousand refugees of but small concern.  And there\nwas no one else to turn to.  His messages to the Commonwealth and\nJapanese outposts would not be received for weeks, not believe until\nlong after they were dead.\n\nNot that he was wholly unprepared.  For many long nights he had puzzled\nover charts of this sector, trying to find a place where, if they must\nfight and die, at least it would be on solid ground.  Space combat\nagainst such a force was less than futile.  It was nothing short of\nmurder, with no place to run, and no hope at all.  The trick was to\nfind a land base that could not (or would not) be attacked from the air.\n\nThe memory of the Hegel diamond mines had come to him as pure\ninspiration.  The Cantons, gearing up for an expanded war effort,\ncouldn't possibly afford to knock them out, especially after the\nunexpectedly severe break-up (explosion, really) of Marcum-Lauries One,\nthe valuable ore planet, now lost.  And this far out in neutral space,\nat a time when ships and men were needed elsewhere, he doubted that the\nmines were guarded by more than a token force.  If he got there first,\nand caught them off guard..... Shannon had chosen his second well.\nShin was tough as nails and twice as sharp, and with the same capacity\nfor facing despair without letting it overwhelm him.\n\nHe had acted immediately on the impulse, whatever its source, putting\nthe fleet on standby combat readiness, and jumping light-speed toward\nthe target with five destroyers and two hundred of their combined\narmy's best troops.  No other Canton outpost lay within that vector.\nThe closest neighboring system, Centaurus, was bleak and uninhabited.\nThe rest of the fleet would come behind, arriving roughly forty-eight\nhours later.  Then, if they had been able to subdue and take control of\nthe mines, together they would prepare to meet the Armada.\n\n\n*\n\n\n\"You have grown, Simin-that-was.\"\n\nReturned to the land of his birth, he stood alone by the Carrier Stone\nwith the aging queen who had given him life.  A gentle wind sighed in\nthe valley.  Nothing else moved.\n\n\"I am Simin.\"\n\nShe considered this, listening to his unspoken thoughts.\n\n\"Yes, you are Simin.  What will you do now?\"\n\n\"I must go.\"  It was not necessary, but still he signaled the words to\nher with a touching of the antennae.  For he loved her.  The queen\nbowed her head.\n\n\"The human's death was not wasted.  That pleases me, for his spirit was\ngreat.  Go now with all our thoughts.\"\n\nSimin took his leave of her, flying slowly and circumspectly up out of\nthe Gorge.  These emotions were his alone.  He flew to Shannon's ship,\nand entered it.  Working the controls with melancholy ease, he left\nforever the place of his birth.\n\n\n\n*                         *                         *\n\n\n\nThe Canton Fleet Marshall walked openly toward the three broad cave\nentrances held by the Laurians, tucked in and overhung with shadow at\nthe base of a dry, tawny ridge several thousand feet high, crowned with\nfoliage.  The precious diamond mines lay beyond.\n\nMarshall Bota had not bothered with a signal of truce, or an\nescort---his hovering vehicle stood empty behind him.  No doubt the\nmercenaries would be tempted to shoot; but he had no time for these\ngames.  Shin's move had been a clever aggravation, nothing more.\nLooking up at the wind-veined rock, the Canton told himself with mild\namusement that he should drop it on their heads.  The hostages meant\nnothing to him, and the mines could be re-dug.....  But some of his\nsoldiers might not understand.  Wait until later in the war, once\nthey'd had a taste of it.\n\nShin watched the approaching general through the glasses, searching for\nany sign of personal weakness.  It was indeed their only hope.\nRecognizing him as the Fleet Marshall, a small voice inside did in fact\ntell him to shoot.  But though bitterness rose strong against\nrestraint, he knew that it would be pointless and dishonorable to kill\nhim now.  Though doubtless if the tables had been turned.....\n\nBota was somewhat surprised to see the Korean's solid form emerge from\nthe canopy of shadow, striding toward him.  He had expected an older\nman.  He stopped where he was and waited.  A slight upgrade, and the\ntwo stood face to face.\n\nThe marshal unclasped his breathing mask and slipped it aside, though\nthe dense atmosphere of that place was barely sustainable to human\nlife.  The Korean did the same.\n\n\"Commander Shin, I believe.\"  Shannon's second was only mildly taken\nback by the use of his name and proper rank.\n\n\"Bota.\"\n\n\"MARSHAL Bota.\"\n\n\"You didn't come all this way to tell me...(he struggled for breath)...\nhow many men you stabbed in the back!  What do you want?\"\n\n\"One would expect a cornered monkey to show more respect.\"\n\n\"A cornered MAN has nothing to live for.  Speak your piece and get out.\"\n\n\"All right.  I want the hostages.  I want them now.  Your civilian\nships will be allowed. . .to whimper to Soviet Space.  We won't stop\nthem.  It's your hides we're after.\"\n\n\"You'll let them go, just like that.  Is that why you destroyed ALL our\nships?  Is that why your ground equipment is lined up against us?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.  There is that.  Well.  We've had our little talk.  Enjoy\nyour moment of heroism.  Lord knows. . .I'll enjoy ending it.\"  He\nstarted to walk away, then turned.  \"Oh, about the hostages.\"  Shin's\nglare was unchanging. \n\"Cut off their heads, and throw them down into the mines.  I'm going\ngrind you to powder.\"\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe Canton line advanced slowly from its distance of five kilometers, a\nvisually odd procession of large flat vehicles, cat-tracked, with\nlightly armored ground troops hurrying behind, protected by the\nadvancing shield wall of the Armadillos.  Huge laser cannons projected\nfrom their slanting fronts, all trained upon the thick bar of shadow at\nthe base of the oncoming ridge.  Bota's machine led the subtle wedge,\nits magnetic-field disrupter already pulsing to try and weaken the\nLaurian's shields.\n\nShin barked out his orders rapidly, for all the good it would do.  He\nstood with several of the men before the instrument-laden vision panel,\nsimultaneously listening to analysis of the enemy advance, searching\nfor a non-existent weakness, and trying to exude some measure of\nconfidence and calm---which wasn't easy with only four big guns of his\nown, and his power-shields unstable.  His headset buzzed with two and\nthree voices at once.  THERE HAD BEEN NO TIME TO LAY ARMADILLO MINES!\n\nThe civilians (those who would go) were huddled in groups of two- to\nfive-hundred in the deepest recesses of the mines, along with the\nprisoners.  He had no illusions about their safety.  The rest, perhaps\na thousand grim, forlorn men and women, stood resignedly behind them in\nthe vast hollow that joined the three cave openings, bright arches that\nlooked out on the light of day, watching a young officer try\ndesperately to save them.  And all the while Shin struggled to think\nwhat Shannon would do in his place, and what he would feel.\n\nAll at once the Canton lasers began to fire.  The temperature in the\nenclosure rose noticeably, and the walls began to tremble from the\npushed-back force of the shields.  The soprano thump of their own guns\nbegan to sound, as Shin fired his energy bursts in answer.  They made a\nbrave sight and sound, bright spheres whizzing through carefully timed\nopenings in the shields, but seemed to have little effect on the grim\nmachination set against them.\n\nFeeling the trap close in, Shin strode from one battle station to the\nnext, snarling his commands like an animal.  Sections of rock crashed\ndown from the ceiling to the sound of screams and deep pocks.  A great\nfissure rose along one wall, widening, and he began to wonder if he had\nnot murdered these people after all.  One of the Laurian gunners was\nstruck by a falling stone, and he ran to take his place.\n\nAs suddenly as it had begun, the Canton barrage ceased.  The advancing\nmachines stopped dead in their tracks.  The Laurian shields, too, went\ndown, and their guns would not fire.  The clustered civilians, many\nlocked in sheltering embraces, looked around and at each other.  Medics\nran to attend the wounded.\n\nBewildered, Commander Shin moved out from the largest of the cave\nopenings to examine his shield projectors.  To left and right they were\nintact.  WHAT HAD HAPPENED?\n\nHe heard a soft roar as of a ship passing high overhead.  He looked\nfirst at the halted Canton wedge, not trusting.  They were little more\nthan a kilometer away.  The ground troops moved about in confusion as\nofficers shouted, but the great Armadillos were silent and still.\n\nTentatively at first, the scattered shapes and tension-drawn faces of\nhis own soldiers, intermixed with the Laurian refugees, stepped out\nfrom the dividing line of shadow.  He thought to order them back, but\ndid not.  He, too, felt his eyes drawn to skyward.  Against the dark,\ngreenish dome, cloudless, an orange flame descended from out of the\npale fire of the sun.  It was not a large ship.....  Shin tried to\ndiscipline his hope.\n\nThere could be no doubt.  It was Shannon's ship.\n\nThe weathered vessel landed between the two armies.  Shin wanted to run\nto it wildly, with tears in his eyes.  But a voice spoke inside him,\nsaying simply:\n\n\"Peace.  Your master is dead.\"\n\nThe hatch of Bota's machine had been opened, and now he clambered out,\nhis face red with rage.  \"Shannon!\" he shouted, as if his voice could\npenetrate steel.  \"Whatever trick this is, it won't work!\"  He barked\nan order to one of his lieutenants, who threw him a weapon and\nassembled one full company behind him.  The marshal clambered down the\nvehicle's tracks and leapt to the ground.  Collecting himself he strode\nforward, with half his men behind him.\n\nShin looked on, puzzled, ordered his own people to stay back.  As Bota\ndrew to within fifty yards of the vessel, Simin opened the hatch.  The\nCanton raised his rifle, then lowered it in sudden dismay.\n\nSimin stepped out onto the threshold, and with a short burst of wings,\nstood on the ground beyond it.  Again Shin heard a voice.  \"Remain.\nThis is not your fight.\"\n\nThose who did not know Shannon well could not have seen his imprint on\nthe creature's stark, intimidating face.  Shin had seen it, though\nunwillingly.  The Force Marshall had not.  Simin came to a level in\nfront of him, then stopped.  He said nothing, stared with an unreadable\nexpression.\n\n\"What are you?\" demanded Bota, trying not to be unnerved.\n\n\"What do you want?\"  Simin answered him without haste.\n\n\"I have come to fight you.  To kill you if I can.\"\n\n\"WHAT?\"  Bota forced himself not to take a step back.  \"What quarrel\nhave you with the Republic of Cantos?\"  Then seeing no change:  \"My men\nwill burn you to ash.\"\n\nSimin responded slowly, not to be dramatic, but because he wanted the\nexchange to mean something.  He soon saw that it would not.\n\n\"No, your men are powerless.\"  He paused.  \"You seem to have little\nrespect for the one called Shannon.  This I do not understand.  Even as\nan enemy, could you not see the courage he possessed?\"  It was useless.\n \"You think that you are stronger.  You have only to fight as well as\nhe, and his cause will be vanquished.....  Prepare yourself!\"  He could\nnot submerge his anger, knowing what Shannon had known, and reading the\nthoughts of this proud and willful man.\n\nHe stepped back, and the weapon in Bota's hands was changed to a long\nknife.  Then, no longer an illusion, the marshal was given a physical\nprowess equal to his own.  But remembering the Cherokee, Simin gave him\nstill greater advantage.\n\nAs Bota stood bewildered, a deep murmur grew in the air all around him,\na rising chant, descending from the sky like a fall of cloud along the\nway the ship had come.  Those of his soldiers who looked behind them\nsaw the lesser ridge at its distance appear to grow, layered with the\nghost image of a high, terraced precipice, with statued spires rising\nfrom its base.\n\nThe refugees saw these things as well, as the chant became mixed with\nthe sound of drumming wings.  And it seemed to them that their own\nnumbers grew, or they were suddenly aware, of a vast multitude around\nthem.  The marshal looked about him and at Simin, as if slowly\ndescending into Hell.  The drone felt no pity for him.\n\n\"Fight for your life, if you are able!\"\n\nThe mai began to circle with all the disciplined fire of his heart, and\nBota had no choice but to submerge his fear.  He fought.  He swung his\nweapon tentatively at first, not believing it real.  But this thought,\ntoo, was soon of little avail.  He slashed and dove, summoning all the\nstrength and endurance of his kind:  the wakened animal, fearing death.\n As the sound closed around them like witness to every struggle of good\nand evil ever fought.\n\nTheir battle was even at first, with the Canton's fierce, desperate\nwill so confronted.  Their battle was even.\n\nBut after a time that will began to waver, and his fear to grow to a\nweakness inside him.  Almost he sensed that the creature could not beat\nhim, had not the strength.  Yet his fear formed an equal voice,\nlamenting that its spirit fought on so, and would not be cowed.  Both\nwere cut and bloodied, and weary to the point of exhaustion.\n\nSimin, his own being stretched to the limit, sensed the other's\nweakness and made it his island of hope.  He continued.\n\nAnd at the last, driven to a supreme and final effort, he drove his foe\nto the ground in a shallow depression, and with a trembling foreclaw,\nslashed his throat.\n\nThe man looked up with terror in his eyes, which slipped to sorrow,\nthen to death.  His body lay still, and the sound was gone.  The\nlandscape was as before.\n\nNot only the Marshall, but all his men lay dead.  The Armadillos were\nas shadows of a dark, machinated dream.  His orbiting fleet, as well as\nthe landing craft, stood emptied of life.\n\nSimin crawled slowly out of the depression, and turned to Shin.\n\n\"Shannon's life has bought your freedom.  Go, then find some way to\nfight them again.\"\n\nHis life and energies spent, his quest ended, Simin opened his\nforeclaws to the sky in a gesture of invocation.  The body split apart,\nand his spirit flew toward the stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBattle Plan\n\n\nTHE STAGE IS SET FOR CONFRONTATION:\n\n1)  P-K4*\n\n*Chess moves.  For greater understanding, may be read in conjunction\nwith a chess board.\n\nThe Belgian-Swiss Alliance had entered the movement on the side of the\nCantons.  Indeed, they had taken it over.  Those of broader vision had\nsuspected such a move was possible.  That Cantos, a single\nplanet-colony of sixty million inhabitants, could hope to make more\nthan minor gains in that newly settled quadrant was somewhat doubtful.\nThe known galaxy was expanding, and the Cantons themselves had been\nlittle more than blind, eager puppets, fed and encouraged from outside,\nclosely watched to see how far they could bend (or simply ignore) the\nprecepts of International Law.  Though the damage they did was all too\nreal.\n\nP-K4\n\nAs the inhabited regions of Space spread out and became more remote, so\nthe rules and niceties which had guided earlier colonization grew thin\nand wore away.  It was merely a question of how much aggression the\nreigning superpowers would allow.  The Four were still a force to be\nreckoned with.\n\n2)  N-KB3\n\nIn the current balance the United Commonwealth held the greatest sway,\nits advanced technology and more plentiful resources always keeping it\none step ahead of Soviet Space.   The Americans had been the first to\ncolonize, and first in deep-space exploration, the advantages of which\nwere still paying off.\n\nN-QB3\n\nThe New Japanese Republic---Empire, in everything but name---was\nstrong, but surprisingly benevolent.  For the first time in its modern\nhistory this serious, hard-working nation had the room and resources to\nkeep its naturally overachieving peoples busy and content.  There was\nno longer any reason for the underlying brutality of earlier Japanese\nculture, and in truth many of the more aggressive social and political\nstances had begun to lose favor among the masses.  How long this\nrelative inner calm would last none could say, and few thought to cross\nthem.  In romanticized histories of the second World War the saying,\n\"Let sleeping dragons lie,\" had been used to refer to the United\nStates.  It now applied with equal and ironic aptness to the Japanese.\n\n3)  B-N5\n\nBut the fastest growing, and to many the most frightening of the Space\ngiants, was the metal-churning monster known simply as 'The German\nStates'.  Their technology and industrial determination once more\nbringing them to the fore of the political arena, this born-again\nsuperpower, in the eyes of many, was the card on which the growing\ninstability would turn.  And the Germans themselves, for reasons not\nentirely clear, seemed to savor this new role, and to do everything\npossible to enhance it.  Most had believed (not without cause) that it\nwas they who encouraged the Cantons, and therefore they who would soon\nbe making their presence felt in the outlying sectors.  But when the\ntime for such a move had come---the ruthless destruction by mercenaries\nof half the Canton fleet at Centaurus (so read the propaganda\nline)---they had shown no such inclination, choosing instead to remain\nneutral.  True, their moneys and weapons were sometimes involved; but\nby all legitimate intelligence not a single German squadron or military\nadviser had been seen within the whole of Andersen sector during the\ndispute.  There could be no denying, however, that their geological\nfleets had moved in quietly after the destruction of the Laurian\nore-planet, recovering valuable mineral wastes that the Cantons could\nnot.  The mysterious 'gravity station' had also disappeared.\n\nP-Q3\n\nHistorians and sociologists who studied the German peoples had found\nthemselves in sudden demand among the politicians and media of the\nsmaller, more skittish nations; and their separate conclusions had been\nnothing if not ambiguous.  The general consensus among the most\nrespected, however, had been that history's \"romantic Huns\" were as\nmysterious and unreadable a people as God ever put on the Earth.  No\none could know what the Germans were capable of, for good or ill, until\nthey did it.  In World War II they had played the part of heinous\nvillains (and done so with terrifying cruelty); in the reshaping of\nEurope after the collapse of the Communist Bloc, they had acted as\ngenerous unifiers, and staunch defenders of the lesser democracies.\nThat this latter posture had finally and decisively cut the political\nbinds and military restrictions imposed by the Allies after the fall of\nthe Third Reich, was a fact that some (though not all) tended to\noverlook.  The one consistency throughout had been an aggressive and\nself-righteous pursuit of nationalistic goals, based partly, but not\nsolely, on a continuing discomfort with Western humanitarian ideals.\n\"The Germans don't want freedom,\" the 20th Century author had declared.\n \"They don't understand it.  What they want is a strong leader, and a\ncause worth fighting for.\"  But here again, words could never quite\ncapture the stubborn fiber of the German spirit.\n\nAnd, of course, those who did not fit the negative stereotype---there\nwere many---were human beings just like any other, complete with their\nshare of artists, dissidents, dreamers, idealists and alternative\npoliticians.  That those in power continued to be for the most part\nconservative, flag waving nationalists (as indeed had become the case\nin the United Commonwealth) did not mean that the Germans had no heart.\n Many quiet, everyday working people secretly hoped for the emergence\nof a more moderate geopolitical stance; and few would deny that a truly\ngood German was as unselfish and compassionate an individual as one\ncould ever hope to find.  Unfortunately, fierce nationalism remained,\nand the end result was always the same:  subtle but continuous\nexpansionism.\n\n4)  P-Q4\n\nBut by all appearances this was not to be a (directly) German war.\n\nB-Q2\n\nYet the shadow of her past, and continued arms build-up, bred little\ntrust among her neighbors.\n\n\n  5)  N-B3\n\nThere was nothing particularly unique about the Belgian-Swiss\nAlliance---the most integral of the 'intermediate' powers\ninvolved---although to themselves it seemed a thing of great\nimportance, occupying countless hours of thought and preparation.\nFormed out of mutual colonial interest scarcely a dozen years before,\nit had since made substantial (if in the eyes of the affluent, still\nmodest) gains in and around the Berlioz Quadrant, and was currently\nexploring the regions that lay beyond---the limits of man's domain in\nthat direction.\n\nLeft behind by the sweeping, mechanized changes of the past two\ncenturies, these proud and businesslike peoples, not wholly dissimilar,\nnow seemed resolutely determined to improve their lot, to gain\nrespectability, and to leave their mark on future histories of the era.\n Whatever that might mean.\n\nP x P\n\nThe Belgian Empire of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had\nlong since past into dust like the ruins of Ozymandias, leaving it a\ndiminutive, unimportant nation of temporal and unstable affluence,\nsubject to the whims and power-plays of its larger, more industrialized\nneighbors.  Like the Germans of the late 1930's, their aggression began\nwith a legitimate (if distorted) complaint.  Glorious, upright Mother\nBelgium had been raped again and again.  That these feelings of injury\nand lost wealth has survived for so many generations, provided a rather\ngrim example of the dangers inherent in an inbred culture which shuts\nout change, clinging instead to a proud and class-conscious society.\n\nIn fairness, the pattern of outside domination and disrespect had\ncontinued until the all too recent past.  Their bitterness was not\nwholly unjustified.  That their own oppression of the Africans during\nthe days of the ivory trade had been a major source of their one-time\nwealth, was not (like the skeletons in so many national closets)\nsomething they tended to weigh into the balance.\n\n6)  N x P\n\n\nThe descendants of Switzerland had reasons and motives that were more\nsubtle, if equally implacable.  Europe's perennial pacifist and bastion\nof neutrality had been left behind for purely economic reasons.  Its\nstable and rigidly controlled economy was no longer needed by the rich\nand powerful as a safe deposit box for (often unscrupulously)\naccumulated wealth.  Concurrently, its self-contained, standoffish\npolitical posture had become obsolete, almost laughable in the face of\nthe growing opportunities of Space.  Like so many other nations without\nan early Space program, the inhabitable and exploitable regions close\nat hand had been divided up without them.  The modern-day Swiss\naccepted the consequences of this flux without bitterness, outwardly at\nleast, but were now inexorably committed to improving upon Fate.\n\nStill, the Swiss view of the coming campaign was somewhat different\nthan their ally's, less zealous, and their actual dislike of their\nenemies and desire for battle were much less vehement.  In their view\nthe Belgians were to provide the fire, they the cool edge of\nprofessionalism.  Between them they formed a somewhat inexperienced,\nbut sullenly determined foe, not to be taken lightly by the smaller, or\nsimilarly stationed powers of the region.\n\nTHUS THE ATTACKERS, AND THOSE WHO WERE TO REMAIN NEUTRAL, IN THE DRAMA\nABOUT TO BE PLAYED.  HERE NOW THE DEFENDERS.\n\nP-KN3\n\nThe former Eastern Bloc nations of Europe had remained closely linked\neconomically after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and surprisingly,\nas often as not, politically allied with their former oppressor.\n\nThe great \"Decade of Change\" which shook the Kremlin in the late\ntwentieth century had forever changed the face of Marxism, and for\nnearly half a century the Russians had abandoned all thought of\ncommunism.  But decades of poverty, organized crime and ever dwindling\nnational importance, had brought about a socialist\nresurgence---non-violently, through elections this time---and the\ncreation of the new Soviet States.\n\nWith the dismantling of the Eastern bloc, conditional at first, then\nwith fewer and fewer strings, many had predicted a defiant break with\nthe grim, iron-fisted oppressor---a label which unfortunately contained\na good deal of truth---and a wild swing back to the West.\n\nBut in large part it had not occurred.  Possible explanations for this\n'non-schism' ranged from political and cultural isolation during the\nCold War, to the eventual success of numbing Marxist propaganda.  Even\nEast Germany, which reunified with the West, had since divided into two\ngroups, its easternmost peoples falling back on the old alliances.\n\nFor if there was a common thread in the weave of East Europeans, it was\na quiet dedication to hard work, and a genuine, even natural\nunselfishness---a combination of qualities not highly valued in the\nAmericanized west.  And though to brand one half of a continent more\nconcerned with the common good than the other is preposterous, there\ncould be no denying that the two sides of the now extinct Iron Curtain\nremained stiffly uncomfortable with one another's professed doctrines\nand system of values.  Fifty years under vastly divergent philosophies\nand spheres of influence could not be broken down in the years\nimmediately following.  And with the subsequent exodus into Space,\nlearning to live with and understand each other had become largely\nunnecessary.  In the purest sense of the analogy, Eastern Europe had\ntaken one road, and the West another.  The distances that separated\ntheir lives were now literal.\n\nThe nations and alliances resulting from the East-West split remained\nestranged, if no longer sharply opposed.   And in a war that like so\nmany others seemed to be drawing boundaries along lines of ideology,\nthe possibility loomed of their coming together again not with\novertures of peace and understanding, but on the battlefield.\n\nAND FINALLY, THE WATCHERS ON THE MARGINS.\n\n7)  B-K3\n\nThe two major superpowers, still militarily head and shoulders above\nthe rest, hardly added to the stability of the situation.\n\nThe politics of the United Commonwealth, formerly the United States of\nAmerica, remained the politics of a child.   The 'new Americans'\ncontinued to claim God, family, and self-righteous free enterprise (to\ntheir Republicans a god in itself) as the sole and irreproachable\nmotive for all their actions.   Thus everything they did in the realm\nof foreign affairs, usually only half understanding it themselves, must\n(in their eyes) inevitably be right, and for the good of all who\nfollowed the true path of capitalism and democracy---in that order.\n\nSoviet Space, meanwhile, had become equally intransigent.  The Soviets,\nin their turn, hailed as their banner the liberation, equality, and\nself-rule of the working classes.  These, so the Party line claimed,\nhad built civilization, but been denied the fruits of their achievement\nby the corrupt upper classes, who, like Narcissus, were blind and\nself-serving, inherently evil and doomed to fail, but not before\nsucking the blood of true humanity and preventing the dreams of Marx\nand Trotsky.....  And so on, disturbingly similar to the old communist\npropaganda.  And of course they made no mention of Stalin, the purges,\nand the brutal repression of the KGB.\n \nB-N2\n\nThat these two irreconcilably opposed powers, directly or indirectly,\nheld the lives of countless millions in their hands (whether through\naction or non-action) was disheartening, but not at all atypical.\nContending governments and heads of state had managed to keep their\npeoples at odds, away from any sense of shared humanity and mutual\nneed, from the beginning of history.  In this sense at least, those who\nknew something of the nature of war could prepare themselves, if only\nfor the worst.\n\n\"For as you lean,\" spoke the prophet, \"so shall you fall.\"\n\n8)  Q-Q2\n\nThe United Commonwealth, under its present leadership, could best be\ncompared to a wealthy adolescent, raised with the notion that the world\nowed it something, angry and sulking because the expected happiness had\nnot yet been delivered.\n\nIt seemed that every time the Commonwealth's economy threatened to\nbring its standard of living closer to the rest of humanity, angry,\nillusioned people came forward, organized, made aggressive, patriotic\nnoises, and persuaded the middle class (the real power in the\nelectorate) to abandon the floundering liberals and elect a\nconservative, Republican President.  Then, before hard-line\nconservative dogmas could be re-exposed for what they were---a pleasant\nexcuse for big business to run wild---the ax was put to social\nprograms, health and environmental concerns were put on the shelf, and\n'survival of the fittest' became the unspoken ethic.  Large stores of\nweapons were amassed (with the money saved by being less sensitive),\nsome kept, others shipped throughout the galaxy to areas of instability\nwhere \"freedom and self-determination\" were threatened, meaning that\nthe governments there already were, or showed signs of becoming,\nsocialist.  And all such militaristic actions taken with the expressed\npurpose of preventing bloodshed, and similar aggression on the part of\nSoviet Space (which required little prodding to respond in kind),\nresulted in quite the opposite result:  endless carnage and civil war.\n\nThat this same pattern of mutual confrontation had brought the Earth to\nthe brink of nuclear holocaust many times in the past, was apparently\nall but forgotten by a bulk society with a historical attention span of\nroughly five years.  And every time, this cycle was repeated as if it\nwere something new, unique, and wholly necessary, by a people who\nprofessed to be, and probably should have been, the most enlightened in\nthe galaxy.\n\nN-B3\n\nNot that anyone really expected the Americans to fight.  They were for\nthe most part (deep down) morally opposed to violence, had not the\nstomach for it.  And blind, self-serving sheep that they were, the\nmiddle class could only be deceived for so long.\n\nBecause this same, slow-thinking blob of humanity which elected and\ngave the presidents their power, also set the limits for its use.  In a\nnation literally ruled by public opinion, they were like an anchor\nunsoundly planted.  The ship was free to drift a certain distance to\neither side, but could never move too far in any one direction before\nthe anchor finally caught on some solid objection, and the movement was\nbrought to a halt.  True, the angry seemed angrier this time, the\naggressive less easily pacified, and the Christian right-wing (a\ncontradiction of terms, for anyone the least familiar with Jesus'\nteachings) more implacable.  But it had been nearly a hundred years\nsince the Commonwealth had been directly involved in any kind of\noffensive (military) war.  Most observers had come to think of this\nnaive superpower as a big dog that liked to bark and throw its weight\naround, but wasn't really looking for a fight.  The damage it did was\nmore subtle and indirect---like stepping on flowers not yet open, and\ncrushing creatures too small for it to see.\n\nBut as the saying went, \"When you sleep in the same bed with a giant,\nyou had better sleep lightly.\"  The United Commonwealth was the most\npowerful nation-state in the history of mankind, the more so because it\ndid not know its own strength.\n\n9)  P-B3\n\nThese are, of course, the bare facts, and like all generalization,\nsubject to flaw.  There were West Germans who loathed and rebelled\nagainst every hint of the Nazi mentality, Japanese who had never been\nviolent, Belgians and Swiss who opposed the coming war, members of the\nSoviet leadership who cared, and Americans who saw the world clearly.\n\nUnfortunately, as all too many times in the past, there did not seem\nenough who broke the mold, nor did they play an active enough role, to\nkeep the wheels of ignorance and violence from churning.  Because the\nstudy of war is the study of people in power and the masses they are\nable to persuade---of strife, twisted dreams and ambitions, and of\nhuman nature set in its darkest surroundings.  For this reason the\nsmall and destructive characteristics of a people (of the aggressors,\nat the least) tend to surface, often riding on the back of what is\ntruest and noblest in them, and individuals silently opposed to the\npolitics of carnage don't seem to count for much.\n\nThe sad and simple truth remains that, to be prevented, nationalistic\naggression must be resisted from within, either by large numbers of the\npopulation, or by those in positions of power who are willing and able\nto stop it.  And so far throughout history, with very few exceptions\nand during wars uncounted, it had not been.\n\n\n*                         *                         *\n\n\n0-0\n\nThe battle room aboard the armed space station Mongoose was quietly\ntense and alert.  The Czech and East German officers attended their\nvarious stations with well-drilled efficiency and outer calm,\nintermittently reading off coordinates and running hands across\npulsating fingerboards, making adjustments and speaking by headset to\nthe various squadron commanders of the close-hovering fleet.  The\ndefense grids---interlocking walls of energy which prevented the free\nand rapid movement of attacking ships---were in place and activated.\n\nIn the center of the room, behind a spherical plexiglass screen, a\nthree-dimensional monitor projected tiny wavering shapes among the\nstatic lines of the grid, marking the approach of the Belgian-Swiss\nforces.  A young lieutenant of average height and wiry build, with\nintelligent eyes and features, studied the projection and corresponding\nconsole before him with fascination and growing apprehension.  He felt\nfoolish and out of place:  his first battle.\n\nA taller man in his late fifties, stern and brown-eyed, a classic Czech\nsoldier to the last detail, came up behind and put a hand on his\nshoulder.\n\n\"Courage, Brunner,\" he said in low harsh tones.  \"I need your judgment\ntoday.\"  It was the closet thing to a compliment he had ever paid his\nyoung protege.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Colonel.  It's beginning to look very real.\"\n\nDubcek's dark features bored in on him in the familiar\nexpression---down-thrust head and knitted brows, eyes looking up\nthrough them like a boxer's.  It was a hard and intimidating face,\nthough with a gleam of sharp and illusionless intelligence.  Only\nBrunner seemed to suspect a deeper humanity beneath the facade, and he\nwas far from certain.\n\n\"It is real, but not something to be feared.  Real men will die this\nday, as all men must.  It is the only way to stop them.\"  At that\nmoment the voice of the executive officer broke in on them.\n\n10)  B x N\n\n\"Colonel, enemy light cruiser 'red' engaging destroyer group B.\"\n\nDubcek nodded in acknowledgment.  Brunner quickly adjusted and replaced\nhis ear-piece, and the sounds of actual combat came to him for the\nfirst time.  He heard:  ships signaling one another, attacking, being\nattacked, some voices calm, others tense and on the verge of\npanic---explosions and bursts of pain within bridge compartments,\nengineers crying damage reports, men dying and signals going blank.\nThe older man heard them too, studied the projection without haste,\nmade several marks on the glass.  Again the voice of the exec:\n\n\"Destroyer group B has succumbed---no surviving ships.\"\n\nBrunner watched his commander's face, half expecting to see no change.\nBut a change did come, if only for an instant:  a cloud of pain and\nuncertainty flashed across it.  The dark countenance grew darker still,\nand he muttered beneath his breath.  \"If he wants to trade, we'll\ntrade.\"\n\nP x B\n\n\"Advance robot battery 7,\" he said out loud.  \"Knock him out of the\nsky.\"  The order was passed on, and several seconds later the blip that\nhad been the enemy cruiser also vanished from the globe.\n\nA yeoman entered, bringing news of the Coalition reinforcements.\nDubcek acknowledged the message, gave one of his own, then turned to\nhis young lieutenant as if in answer to his unspoken question.  His\neyes, like those of a bird of prey, had returned to their normal\nluster.\n\n\"We don't have to beat him, just hold him off till help arrives.  That\nis why we are aligned defensively, ready to counter-punch, and take\nadvantage of his mistakes.\"  Both turned back to the projection, and to\ntheir own thoughts.\n\n11)  0-0-0\n\nMasaryk began to speak again, but Dubcek waved him off.  \"Here,\" he\npointed.  \"He's moved his battle station behind the carrier, and\nbrought the corresponding battleship to corridor five, trying to\nstrengthen his position for a frontal assault.\"\n\nBrunner hesitated, not wishing to overstep his bounds.  \"Does that\nsurprise you?\"\n\nDubcek almost smiled.\n\n\"No.  He imagines he's being clever, showing me something I haven't\nseen.  But I've played this game a few times before.\"  To his exec:\n\"Battleship A to corridor four.\"  Masaryk nodded, and passed the order\non.  The main battle computer silently acknowledged the move.\n\nR-K1\n\nAgain Dubcek turned to his lieutenant.  \"In a battle of this scale, and\nfought under the controlled conditions imposed by the grids,\npreparation is paramount.  But once the real fighting begins, the book\ngoes out the window.  You may see me do things you question.  If so, do\nnot assume that you are wrong.  Decisions made in the heat of it are\nbased mostly on instinct, and instincts can go astray.  Don't override\nme, but if you see anything unusual in either my strategy or his, I\nwant your comments as soon as there is time.\"\n\nBrunner was having trouble adjusting to this new intimacy, however\nstrained.  \"Colonel.  Won't the computer do that?\"\n\n\"To hell with the computer.  This is no damned field exercise.  I'll\nask for your comments, and those of my staff because I want input, not\nanalysis.  You'll be dead wrong most of the time.\"  The expression\nchanged slightly.  \"I need your inexperience, to remind me of things I\nmight forget.\"\n\nDubcek moved back toward the place where his exec stood leaning over\nthe main ship's console, one hand on the back of the First Technician's\nchair, the other pointing to the vision screen before her.  Both looked\nup as their commander approached.\n\n\"Major,\" he said to the woman.  \"Would you excuse us for a moment?\"\nWessenberg rose, gave a quick bow and left them.\n\n\"Well,\" he said to Masaryk, who had been his second many times in the\npast.  \"What do you think of the way he has positioned himself?\"\n\n\"He's done very well.  If he does as well the rest of the way, we could\ncatch it hot.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he won't.  Everything up to this point has been done by the\nbook---his computer could have done the same.  Once the main engagement\nstarts, he'll find himself hard pressed to sweep us away.  We have\nreinforcements coming in six hours.  He does not.\"\n\n\"Do you take that for granted?\"\n\n\"What do you think?\"  The commander glared and Masaryk, who knew him\nwell, adopted a more deferential tone.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Rolf.  As always, you see what troubles me.  It makes no\nsense.  Why do they divide their forces, and simultaneously attack the\nDutch colonies at Larkspur?  Half their fleet tied up hundreds of\nparsecs away, the rest barely more than what we have here.  They may\nwalk through the Dutch outposts---they have the hardware---but they\nwill have no such easy time here.\"\n\n\"Could they have made an alliance we don't know about? the greater part\nof their force yet to arrive?\"\n\n\"Yes, but with who?  And how will they come in time?  Our Coalition\nreconnaissance nets are thick and constantly monitored, yet we've heard\nof no unaccounted for ships anywhere in the vicinity.  He has walked\ninto this as if he knows no fear, and that troubles me.  The Belgians\nmight attempt such a thing, but never the Swiss.\"\n\n\"But doesn't the fact that they show no fear prove they are capable of\nanything?  Ambition and inexperience often lead to such blunders.\"\n\n\"Yes.  Let us hope that is it.\"  He unconsciously turned toward Brunner\nwith a wistful glance.  \"Still. . .this could be our last battle.\"\n\nMasaryk looked up at him, stunned.\n\n\"Peace, my friend.  I only meant that the times are changing, and we\nmust prepare the young.\"\n\nAs Dubcek walked away, and gestured the technician back to her post, it\nsuddenly occurred to Masaryk that in all their years together, he had\nnever before called him friend.\n\n12)  B-R6\n\nAlmost the instant Major Wessenberg sat down, she saw a movement so\nincredulous that at first she thought something must be wrong with the\nequipment.  Not waiting for the exec:\n\n\"Colonel.  He's brought his second cruiser straight at us.\"\n\nDubcek hurried back, stood on the other side of her, checking the\nscreen.  He turned back to Brunner, who said \"Correct,\" in a voice\nsuddenly full of optimism.\n\n\"By God, he is a fool.  Light cruiser A, engage.\"  Masaryk relayed the\nmessage, and the Czech/East German light weapons ship advanced.\n\nB x B\n\n\"Now he's put his foot in it.\"\n\n13)  Q x B\n\n\"Enemy carrier to corridor one---light cruiser knocked out.  Carrier\nfighters and torpedo ships releasing.\"\n\n\"Of course; he's got no choice.  All forward guns at the ready.\nBattleship A to column four.\"\n\nR-K4\n\nAs the Exec relayed these orders and the gunnery shields were rolled\nback, along with the steel plates that covered the huge battle room\n'window,' those in the large, arcing chamber were given their first\ndirect view of the battle among the stars. The massive Bel-Swiss\ncarrier, of German States construction, loomed long and gray at its\ndistance, fighters and missile ships hovering below it, but made no\nattempt to come closer, within the range of their guns.  It had been\nbrought forward without adequate support.  Far to the right their own\nbattle cruiser could be seen moving into place, along with the\nstationary first destroyer group and robot-repulse ships, all perfectly\npositioned.  And they knew also that their own carrier, every measure\nthe equal of the enemy's, was not far off, ready to be brought into\nplay at a moment's notice.\n\nThe twenty-odd officers and staff within the battle room, to that point\nlargely somber and dutiful, trying to suppress anxiety and inner doubt,\nseemed to come suddenly to life.  They attended their posts with\ngreater enthusiasm, and unconsciously began to speak louder and faster,\nthrough the headsets and to each other.  For the real fighting had\nbegun; it was no longer left to dark imagining.  They were doing it,\nwith the clear and early advantage going to their own forces.  Their\ncommanding officer, a staid veteran who had been here before, grew in\ntheir eyes to something almost more than human, while the enemy's\ncommanders had begun to show signs of impatience and inexperience.  The\noncoming fleet, which before had loomed so ominous, became mere ships\nonce more, made of the same metal, and no greater than their own.\n\nDubcek seemed to sense this, and though he did not want to lower their\nconfidence in him---this confidence, and the increased efficiency it\nbrought, were a major reason for all that he did---he knew it was far\ntoo soon to be jubilant.  Before giving his next order, he spoke to\nthem directly.\n\n\"Communications.  Give me an open channel to all vessels.\"  In a louder\nvoice.  \"I want the rest of you to listen to this also.\"  The channel\nwas opened, and his voice subtly amplified within the chamber.\n\n\"This is your commander speaking.  Do not be premature in your\nenthusiasm.  Our enemy has overextended himself and diminished his\nforce without apparent gain, but that is all.  While his actions may\nseem foolish, we do not know all the reasons they were taken.  I have\nlearned in my many years that things are not always as they first\nappear.  If you believe everything you see, or must see confirmation of\nall you believe is happening, you will be misled.  I have faith in your\ncourage and your judgment.  We still have a long way to go.\"  Without\nfurther speech he moved away and stood by Brunner's tactical projection\nglobe.  The room became quieter, the faces more serious.\n\n\"Your observations, lieutenant.\"\n\n\"May I ask a question first?\"\n\n\"Ask it.\"\n\n\"Do you suspect he has reinforcements coming?  If not, I see no logical\npattern to his later development.  Why did he not move straight ahead\nwith his robot batteries, try to weaken our forward wall?\"\n\n\"War is seldom logical, Brunner, but it is a valid point.  As for\nreinforcements, I wish I knew.  I don't see how; but I must remember it\nis possible.\"\n\n14)  P-KN4\n\nMasaryk's voice.  \"Enemy robot ship coming straight ahead, corridor\ntwo.\"  Brunner suppressed an urge to look out through the wide portal.\n\nDubcek pointed to the globe, again made several marks on the glass.\n\"You see.  Now he's done it, but a step too late.  Carry on.\"  He\nstrode back to the command station, nodding sternly to his second.\n\"Bring our carrier to corridor three.  Engage his if he's willing.\"\n\nQ-KB1\n\nSeveral minutes later the huge outline of the German/Czech carrier ship\nbecame visible, though still at a distance, as it took up its position\nbeside and slightly ahead of them.  The engagement, if it took place,\nwould happen right before their eyes.\n\nThe fighters and larger torpedo ships of both vessels continued to\nstream out of launching chutes spread across their undersides, forming\nup into squadrons, attack groups and flotillas.  The starboard guns of\nthe Mongoose were activated, and Masaryk could be heard giving\ninstructions to the captain of the second battle cruiser.\n\nBrunner looked up to see Dubcek standing before the foot-thick plate\nglass of the battle room portal, headset on and hands clasped tightly\nbehind his back, the one held by the other opening and closing\nsporadically.  The huge 'window' began at his feet, rising and arching\nhigh above his head.  For a moment Brunner's eyes lost their focus, and\nthe aging commander seemed to stand among the stars:  between two\ngiants and their swarming offspring, trying to orchestrate, or at least\ninfluence, a battle between angry gods and their armies, wholly\nunaware, and indifferent to his presence.\n\nThe Belgian-Swiss carrier, which had the edge in tempo and preparation,\ncame forward.  Squadrons bolted forward, and both sides began to fire.\n\nAt first the more experienced German/Czech pilots seemed to be holding\nthe enemy off, keeping his forces from linking up into an effective\nattacking thrust.  But the sheer numbers of the ships pouring out at\nthem (which they had no way of anticipating), and the equally\nsurprising effectiveness of the carrier's supporting fire, began slowly\nbut inexorably to turn the tide against them.  Lasers and explosive\ntorpedoes flashed.  Ships burst silently into flame, or broke apart, or\nwere disintegrated.  The tortured voices that came to Brunner through\nhis ear-piece were soon more than he could bear.  Almost he wished that\nthe gray goliath would turn its guns on them, that they might respond.\nBut it was a wasted hope.  Though tantalizingly close, the aggressor\nand all his forces were just out of range, and they knew it.\n\nBrunner next became aware, to his dismay, that none of this seemed to\nalarm either Dubcek or his executive officer.  The commander watched,\nbut gave no order; and Masaryk continued to speak only to the captain\nof the corresponding battleship.\n\nHe suddenly realized what this meant, but a part of his mind refused to\naccept it.  They were sacrificing their own carrier to set up and then\ndestroy the other.  Strategically it was sound---weakening the enemy's\nthrust, buying time for the reinforcements.\n\nBut what of the lives and humanity, the hundreds of men and women whom\nDubcek had just spoken to about courage and judgment?  What about their\nFAMILIES?  Didn't he care?  Didn't anyone care?  And where was the God\nthat he had reluctantly begun to believe in?\n\nAt that moment all he knew was hatred and grief.  For perhaps a minute\nhe ignored his instruments, glaring instead at Dubcek's back, silently\ndaring him to turn around.\n\nSuddenly a ship burst apart directly in front of them, not more than\nten kilometers off.  Out of the wreckage a tiny white projectile moved\ntoward them, and others of similar shape were sent flying in all\ndirections.  To his horror Brunner recognized them as men.  Too light\nan object to trigger their shields, the writhing body came straight at\nthem, seeming to gather speed, and with a final orgasm of misery,\ncrashed against the glass.\n\nWith a dull thud it bounced off and back into the emptiness of Space,\nleaving a wide splotch of blood on the glass at their commander's feet.\n If Brunner hated him then, the emotion changed when the man finally\ndid turn around.  There were no tears, but something in his face spoke\nof a much deeper wound.  His voice boomed across the room.\n\n\"If there is anyone here who does not yet know what war is, look with\nyour eyes!\"  His arm jerked toward the stain.  \"It is blood!  Blood and\nmen dying.\"\n\nAs if cued by these words a blinding flash, followed in rapid\nsuccession by several others, lit the room.  The enemy carrier, finally\nscoring a direct and unshielded hit, had sent its blackened counterpart\nto infinity.\n\nQ x Q\n\nAs if regretting his outburst Dubcek stood very still, then descended\nthe high step and strode quickly to the command station.  He took off\nthe headset, and gave his orders.\n\n\"Battle cruiser B:  I want a full spread of anti-matter torpedoes, then\nmove in and finish him off.  All remaining fighters back to Scypion\nBase; those that can't make it, to Mongoose emergency docks.  Destroyer\ngroup A, prepare to clean up enemy stragglers.\"\n\n\"And the torpedo ships, Colonel?\"\n\n\"Keep firing at the carrier until there is no carrier to fire AT.\"\n\n\"But without escort---\"\n\nDubcek's eyes flashed.  Masaryk relayed the orders.\n\nR x Q\n\nThe battle between the two vessels must have ensued---after several\nminutes the enemy carrier disappeared from the projection globe---but\nBrunner saw and heard none of it.  He remained silent with his head\ndown, palms leaning heavily on the console.  Crying.  The next thing he\nwas aware of was Dubcek's steadied voice, once more amplified, once\nmore, he assumed, on an open channel to all ships.  He looked out of\nthe portal, but there was no afterglow.  Nothing.  Dubcek's voice.\n\n\"All ships' personnel not engaged or on standby readiness, this is your\ncommanding officer.  The carrier J.S. Bach and all its crew have been\nlost.\"  Pause.  \"There is nothing that can bring them back, or justify\ntheir death.  They will be sorely missed.\n\n\"But know this:  that they died not in any act of aggression, but\ndefending their homes, and the ones they loved.  It may be small\nconsolation, but we have hurt our enemy badly.  They no longer have the\nposition or the firepower to seriously threaten us.  I won't lie to\nyou.  More men and women will die before our reinforcements arrive.\nAnd there is no more fairness to who dies in battle than there is to\nwho is struck down by fatal illness, and who is left to die of age.....\n We can only continue, and hope that our acts will one day be\nremembered, and our sorrows vindicated.\n\n\"My strategy from this point forward will be to engage the enemy as\nlittle as possible, which is only now a viable option.  Take heart in\nthe fact that this is now a fight he cannot win, unless he holds some\ncard that is hidden from me.  The colonies, the people you guard, are\nsafe.  And if we keep our courage and our wits about us, we will see\nhim beaten before the day is passed.\"\n\nDubcek signaled the communications officer to shut him off, said to\nMasaryk, \"I'll be in my quarters.  I don't think he'll try to attack\nagain soon, but call me if he does.\"  And left the battle room.\n\nBrunner gathered himself, sat down before the console and tried to\nthink.\n\n*\n\n\nAfter perhaps fifteen minutes he got up and asked Commander Masaryk to\nbe relieved, saying that he felt ill.  The executive officer, who knew\na thing or two, looked hard at him and said, \"If you've got any sense,\nyou'll be careful what you say to him.\"\n\nBrunner nodded, and walked slowly out into the main corridor, then\nthrough several passages before reaching the short hallway that ran\nbefore his Commanding Officer's chamber.\n\nRemaining a short distance from the doorway, he hesitated.  He gathered\nhis courage, turned the corner and entered the room.\n\n\"Sir, may I speak---\"  He stopped, seeing the older man sitting quietly\nat a wooden table, a bottle and glass in front of him.  \"I'm sorry,\nsir.....  Excuse me.\"  So far as he (or anyone) knew, the Colonel never\ndrank.\n\n\"No, no.  Come in.  You have not discovered a terrible secret.  I have\nan artificial liver; didn't you know?  I can turn it higher whenever I\nwish---the first sign of combat---and be sober in two minutes time.  A\nwaste of good liquor, really.  Please.  Sit down.\"  Brunner approached\nhesitantly, sat in the wooden chair opposite.\n\n\"Besides,\" the man continued.  \"Didn't you know that all good field\ncommanders were drunks?  Take the famous Ulysses S. Grant.  They say\nthat on the day of a battle he was rarely sober by mid afternoon.\nProbably why he was so successful:  he could send his men off to the\nslaughter without a second thought.  Some even go so far as to say he\ntried to end all his battles in a single day, so that the next morning,\nwhen he was apt to be sick, he could sleep and give no orders.  But you\nlook surprised.  Is all of this new to you?\"\n\n\"I was never much on the American Civil War,\" said the young man\nevasively, not liking (or understanding) the tone of sarcasm in the\nolder man's voice.\n\n\"Oh, really?  That's too bad.  It is filled with such irony.  For\nexample, the saying, 'War is hell.'  Very true, but do you know who\nsaid it?  The equally famous General Sherman.  And he should know,\nsince he did everything in his power to make it so---burned and\npillaged like a regular barbarian.  A nation of 'heroes'.\"  He cleared\nhis throat, continued.\n\n\"And these same, gentlemen soldiers---Grant (then President, no less),\nSherman, Sheridan and Custer, next turned their expertise upon the\npesky Native Americans, who had the gall to defend their land, their\nwomen and their children.  Wasn't it Sheridan who said, 'The only good\nIndian is a dead Indian?'  Massacred and starved an entire population\ninto submission, innocents slaughtered without a second thought.\"\n\n\"Colonel.....\"\n\n\"But here, I'm boring you.  What did you want to discuss---literature,\nfine art?\"  He took another drink from the glass, hurting his throat\nwith too large a gulp, showing that he really was not a drinker, or not\na practiced one.\n\n\"Two things,\" said Brunner stiffly.  \"First as an officer of the\nbridge.  Then as a man.\"\n\n\"It sounds serious.  Well.  What is your report as my analysis officer?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I only wanted to reinforce what I said earlier:  that the\nenemy's strategy, ever since the main engagement began, makes no sense.\n He had attained a strong attacking position; his weaponry is at least\nthe equal of our own; and yet he attacks without design, and trades\nforces with no apparent gain.  I know, from my studies (this last he\nadded almost as an apology), that battles are often chaotic.\nCommanders become confused, lines of communication break down, soldiers\nand officers panic.  But none of this, so far as I can see, has been\nthe case here.  For example, why accept the sacrifice of our carrier?\"\nHe reddened, forced himself to continue.  \"Just because we brought it\nforward, hardly forced him to attack.  I wish I could believe that the\nenemy is really that foolish.  But I can't.  They have spent years of\npreparation, and nearly all their resources. . .for what?  Only to let\nsome impatient general throw it all away?  The only explanation I can\nfind is that they are trying to lull our sense of caution and weaken\nour defense, for another fleet that is yet to come.  I know that by all\ncurrent technology this is impossible.  Yet I feel that it could\nhappen.\"\n\nAt the words 'current technology' Dubcek stirred uncomfortably.  The\nyoung man had sensed his darkest fear.  He remained quiet for a moment,\nmulling this over.\n\n\"You have done what I asked,\" he said finally, \"and done it well.  Now.\n What do you have to say to me as a man?\"\n\nNow it was Brunner who could find no comfort in his chair.\n\n\"I wish to resign my commission,\" he said with an effort.  \"I do not\nthink I was made to give orders.\"\n\n\"Do you hate me so much?\"\n\nBrunner winced.  \"No, Colonel.  It is true, I hated you at first---\"\nHe looked up, horrified at his own words.\n\n\"Come on.  Out with it.  It won't matter much if you resign.\"  Dubcek's\nmanner was unruffled, but the lieutenant thought he caught a gleam of\npain, or something, in his dark eyes.\n\n\"There was a moment when I hated you---when I first realized you had\nsacrificed our carrier for theirs.  But I don't feel that way now.\"\n\n\"Then why?\"\n\n\"I just can't do it.  I tried to put myself in your place. . .and I\ncan't.  This way of life, of thinking.....  I can't.\"\n\n\"You think I send men to their death without feeling.\"  It was not a\nquestion.\n\n\"No.\"  But Brunner would say no more.\n\n\"No, but that was cruel of me.  Young men are so much more, SENSITIVE.\nYou think you could never send men to theirs, that you are not the\nright kind of man---cold, calculating.  You think too much, feel too\nmuch, is that it?\"\n\n\"No.....  I don't know.\"\n\n\"Save war for lonely old men?\"\n\nBrunner looked hard at him, defiant.  This time he was sure.  There was\nsomething quietly desperate in his commander's eyes.  It was fear.  Not\nthe fear of age or death, but that of a far greater hurt:  the pain of\nlife's final reckoning, of uselessness and barren seed.  \"Can I tell\nyou something, 'as a man?'\"  Dubcek turned his eyes away, poured the\nbottle into the glass.\n\n\"Yes.\"  Brunner too looked away.\n\n\"I wasn't always old, or alone, with no other calling.\"  He breathed\nheavily through his nose.  \"But my wife died some years back, and we\nhad no children.  Some men can go on from such a thing:  find another\nwife, start again.  But I am not one of them.  I had never loved\nbefore.....  But that is beside the point.\"  He drank the glass again.\n\n\"I found myself alone, in the military, with no real skill other than\nbeing a soldier, a good officer.  My father had been a working man.....\n So I put all my energies into advancing my career, trying to fill the\nemptiness.  Telling myself.\"  He gave a short, disagreeable laugh.\n\"Telling myself that if I could only rise high enough through the\nranks, that I could SAVE lives.  I was going to make certain the old\nwar-mongers who ran the armies of the world did not subject innocent\npeople to the kind of loss I'd known.  I was going to see to it that no\ntask force was ever advanced needlessly, no ship ever mindlessly\nsacrificed to gain a tactical advantage.\"  He stopped, as some other\nemotion rose up in him.\n\n\"You say you hated me when you learned I had sacrificed a thousand men\nand women.  What would you feel if we had lost, and left the colonies\nunprotected?\"  He rose in a rage, as Brunner stood and backed away.\n\"How would you judge me while some Belgian officer was raping your\npretty little wife?\"\n\nBrunner's eyes flashed murder at him, but he said nothing.\n\n\"Yes.  And how would you have liked me when the political executions\nand imprisonments began?  Forget your romantic notions!  When it comes\nto occupying armies, there are no morals left to judge.\"  He steadied\nhimself, took a breath.\n\n\"Behind us lie the three planets of our people, our home.  One hundred\nmillion inhabitants.  Nothing else stands between them and us.  And\nmaybe our enemies don't even want them.  Perhaps they would be just as\nhappy to destroy the entire system, or even use radiation bombs:  empty\nthe inhabited planets of life without destroying the cities, the\nbeautiful landscape.  Do you think this is a fucking game?\"\n\n\"You misunderstand.  I am not judging you.\"\n\n\"And you misunderstand,\" said Dubcek bluntly.  \"Why do you think I take\nan interest in you?  Why do you think you are here?\"\n\n\"I don't KNOW!\"\n\nDubcek waited.  \"Shall I tell you?\"\n\nBrunner turned his head painfully, faced the older man.\n\n\"You are here because this battle will not end the war.  This war will\nnot be the last our people know.  Because if someone has to command and\nsend young people into battle, I want it to be someone who still has\nsome feeling left....  Because I respect you.....  I have no son.\"\n\nBrunner squeezed his temples with his hands, unable to stop the tears.\n\"But I CAN'T.\"\n\n\"You can, and you must.....  I am not releasing you.\"  Dubcek stalked\nout of the room.\n\nThe young lieutenant did not return to his post for several hours.  The\nbattle went on without him.\n\n16)  P-KR4\nP-KR4\n\n17)  P x P\nN x P\n\n18)  KN-K2\nR-R4\n\n19) QR-N1\nB-K3\n\n20)  P-R3\nP-Q4\n\n\nBrunner reentered the battle room with his head down, walking stiffly\nto the place where a subordinate stood manning his station.  The man\nlooked up, handed him the lightboard---showing how they had arrived at\nthe present disposition---and with a quick bow started to leave.\n\n\"Wait,\" said Brunner quietly.  The man turned.  After an awkward\nsilence.  \"How are we doing?\"  The man looked at him with mild\ncuriosity.\n\n\"As you see.\"\n\n\"That's not what I mean.\"  Their eyes met.  \"Have we truly engaged the\nenemy only when necessary.\"\n\n\"Yes, Lieutenant.  But he does have a battle to fight.  If I may say\nit, the old man has done very well.  But here.\"  He pointed again.\n\"We'll know soon enough.\"  Brunner turned his gaze back to the globe,\nand the man was gone.\n\nLieutenant Olaf Brunner would remember the rest of the battle as bits\nand pieces of a vague, impossible dream.  Unable to bring himself to\nlook out the portal at his fighting comrades, he watched the moving\nshapes as if entranced, as they swam amid the invisible sea of the\nglobe.  Masaryk's voice.\n\n\"Enemy first destroyer group to corridor two, column six.\"\n\nDubcek.  \"Engage.\"\n\n21)  N-N3\nN x N\n\n\"Battle cruiser coming forward to intercept.\"\n\n\"Robot battery 5, attack enemy battery opposite.\"\n\n22)  R x N\nP x P\n\n\n\"He took the bait.  Second destroyer group moving forward.\"\n\n\"Mongoose forward to column two.  Starboard guns to standby alert.\"\n\n23)  N x P\nK-N2\n\n\"Still coming right at us, corridor one.\"\n\n\"Let him come.  Light cruiser, heading C-four.\"\n\n24)  P-R5\nB-B4\n\nAn unfamiliar voice.  \"Colonel.  My instruments show a strange energy\nfield materializing before the enemy battle station, bearing 00 to 04,\nF-six.  Apparently a highly charged, extremely dense mass of negative\nions.\"\n\nHearing this, Brunner's senses came suddenly, vividly to life.  Some\nhalf remembered, theoretical principal of matter.....  As the fear\nmaterialized in thought, he was filled with a dread such as he had\nseldom experienced.\n\nLooking up, he saw that Dubcek too was unnerved.  He turned toward the\nspeaker as calmly as he could and said, \"Link up with the main ship's\ncomputer.  Keep me posted.\"\n\n25)  P-R6(ch)\n\nMasaryk.  \"Robot battery still coming forward, moving into range.\"\n\n\"What?\" replied Dubcek absently.\n\n\"The enemy battery, moving into range and preparing to fire.  We've got\nto move back.\"\n\n\"Yes.  Of course.  Mongoose to corridor one, column one.\"\n\nK-R1\n\nFor some reason these coordinates seemed to Brunner the final\nmanifestation of an impending doom.  Riveting the globe with his eyes,\nhe understood the reason why.  The enemy was perfectly positioned.....\n\n\"Colonel,\" he said.  Dubcek glared at him, angry and agitated.\n\"Colonel, please.\"  The commander left his post and came toward him.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Sir, if that's some kind of star gate---\"\n\n\"It CAN'T be.....  That is only a theory.\"\n\n\"But the American scientists are said to be coming close.\"\n\nDubcek did not wait to hear him out.  He started toward the chief\nscientist.\n\nAt that moment a blinding silver halo split the sky, and through its\ninner darkness passed a ship far greater than any yet seen in battle.\nTo his final, unyielding horror, Brunner saw the outline of an enormous\ncarrier take shape inside the globe, in perfect position for the kill.\n\n26)   New queen appears, QB3.  Check.\n\n\nBECAUSE WAR IS NO GAME, AND NO ONE PLAYS BY ANY RULES.\n\nAt their posts, Masaryk and Wessenberg were struck dumb.  Dubcek stood\nstill in the middle of the room.  The chief scientist had taken out his\near-piece and thrown it to the floor.  All seemed incapable of\nmovement.  Finally Masaryk stirred, shook his head and cleared his\nthroat.\n\n\"Colonel.  A second enemy carrier has appeared.  Bearing 01 to 02,\nF-six.  He's staring right down our throat.\"\n\nDubcek, shaken to the bone, somehow managed a short laugh.  He turned,\nwalked toward his executive officer.\n\n\"Configuration?\"\n\n\"Commonwealth Super-carrier.  It's the Americans, Ivan.\"\n\nDubcek breathed out his final despair.\n\nAt that moment the communications officer turned toward him.  \"Sir.\nIt's the Commonwealth commander with. . .terms for our surrender.\"\n\n\"Bastard,\" he muttered beneath his breath.  Then.  \"Put him on the\nscreen.  And get me General Itjes with the Coalition reinforcements.\"\nHe quickly checked the time.  They were due to arrive in another hour.\n\nThe large main screen of the battle room came to life.  And there in\nthe midst of it, his face animated with tension, confidence and\nself-satisfaction, stood, in military uniform, General Charles William\nHayes, Secretary of State for the United Commonwealth.\n\nHis fear submerged beneath a desperate, fey indifference, Dubcek turned\nto Masaryk with a rueful expression.  \"This just keeps getting\nbetter.....  Yes, Mr. Hayes.  What are your terms?\"\n\n\"I want the immediate surrender of all your forces, and a complete\nshut-down of planetary defense systems.  In return I'll see that your\npeople, both military and civilian, are treated fairly and with\nrespect.\"\n\n\"Oh, I have no doubt of that.  Unfortunately, I do not have the\nauthority to negotiate such a complete capitulation.  I have contacted\nboth our President and the Assembly (a necessary lie), and also the\nCoalition military representative.  You will have an answer soon\nenough.  One question, though, if I may ask it.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"How do you plan to run the occupational government?\"  He looked at\nBrunner as he said these words, turned back to Hayes.  \"Who will be in\ncharge?\"\n\n\"The Belgians and Swiss.\"\n\n\"While you carry the crusade elsewhere?\"\n\nHayes' voice was blunt, brutal.  \"You have five minutes.\"\n\n\"That should be sufficient.  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\"  His face left\nthe screen, and Dubcek immediately went to work.\n\n\"Brunner, Wessenberg, Kinsky and Schmidt, get to the evacuation ships.\nGunnery and engineering high-officers to remain at their posts;\neveryone else off.  First battleship and remaining cruiser to provide\ncover for their retreat, then get out themselves---link up with the\nreinforcements as soon as possible and put themselves under the command\nof General Itjes.  Go on.  Move!\"\n\nMasaryk relayed the orders with grim satisfaction.  His commander was\ngoing to fight.\n\nAs the others filed past him with blank, scared faces, Brunner remained\nat his station.  Dubcek looked over at him.\n\n\"Get out, fool!\"  But still he did not move.  The aging commander\nstrode quickly over to him.\n\n\"There is no time for this.  If you want to be brave then hold on to\nyour commission and fight them again.\"\n\n\"I don't want to leave---\"\n\nThe voice of the communications officer broke him off.  \"General Itjes,\nsir.  I've also contacted the colonies:  all data being relayed.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Dubcek.  \"Put him on and get below.\"  He held out his hand\nto Brunner.\n\n\"Goodbye, Olaf.  Go.  Now!\"  His lieutenant turned and left the room.\n\nFour officers remained in the chamber.  \"Anyone else who wishes to go,\nit must be now.\"  None stirred.  \"Very well.\"  He nodded, turned to\nMasaryk, then remembered General Itjes.\n\nThe chief scientist had moved to the communications board.  He put him\non the screen.  The lined and wizened face of the German General stood\nbefore him.\n\n\"Yes, Ivan.  I understand you're in trouble.  Can you hold him off long\nenough for us to get around his flank?\"\n\n\"Don't bother trying, General.  He's got the ships and firepower to cut\nus both to pieces.  The best thing you can do is guard the civilian\nretreat from Premislyde and Goethe.  I'm afraid Athena must surrender.\"\n\nItjes sighed painfully.  \"All right, then.  Agree to capitulate your\nforces along with it, and stall on the rest for as long as you can.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"He is not about to be detained, and I am not about to let him win this\nbattle without the shedding of American blood.\"\n\n\"Ivan, this is no time---\"\n\n\"This is bigger than both of us, General.  They must know at the very\nbeginning that they will be resisted every step of the way.\"\n\n\"Colonel, it is pointless to die like this.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Helmut.  I have much work to do.  Save as many as you can.\" He\ngestured to the chief scientist, and the screen went blank.  He turned\nto Masaryk.  \"Is Hayes unloading yet?\"\n\n\"Just starting now, sir.\"  They both watched as perhaps a dozen of the\nmonolithic carrier's twenty chutes were lowered and the first wave of\nfighters, mingled with other, larger ships, came streaming off.  \"If\nthat's the Dreadnought.....\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"They say she holds over three hundred vessels---cruisers and\nbattleships among them.  Twice the size of our entire fleet.\"\n\n\"Are the evac ships off yet?\"\n\n\"Checking.  The last one is just clearing now.\"\n\n\"Give them thirty seconds to be off, then put the third robot battery\nin his face.  I'm tired of looking at it.\"\n\nMasaryk waited, gave the order.\n\nP-B3\n\n\"Colonel, it's the Commonwealth commander.\"  Dubcek shook his head.\n\n27)   N x P\n\n\"Bel-Swiss destroyer group engaging.\"\n\n\"Big surprise.  Knock them out with battle cruiser two.\"\n\nR x N\n\n\"Cat's out of the bag now,\" said Dubcek.  \"Hayes is making short work\nof our battleship.  Poor bastards.\"\n\n28)   Q x R(ch)\n\n\"He'll be coming after us, next.\"\n\n\"I hope we didn't make him mad.\"\n\nMasaryk smiled.   Even as they spoke, the great ship, anticipated by a\nswarm of torpedo ships and fighter-bombers, began to come forward,\ngathering speed as if to ram them from the sky.\n\n\"Oh, Lord.  Here they come.\"\n\n\"Bring us forward!

Do you love me?\"\n\nHe rolled away from her and onto his back, stared at the ceiling.  The\nblanket was keeping him warm.\n\n\"I don't know.\"  He was not sure, only that he had never felt this way\nbefore.  Maybe once, long ago, as a child.\n\n\"Because I love you.\"\n\n\"How can you?\"  Now that the rush of sexual elation was over he felt\nwounded, and as hollow and empty as a man can feel.\n\n\"I don't know.  But I do.\"\n\nHe took her hand and held it, against his leg.  The motion was\nmechanical, without feeling.\n\n\"You sure it isn't something Freudian?\"\n\n\"Don't be stupid, Morgan.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry.  He looked straight at the nothing.  But something stirred\ninside him.  \"I care for you very much.\"\n\nShe studied him in the half-light.\n\n\"Are those your own words?\"\n\n\"No.  I think Lawrence said them.\"  Nothing.  \"You see what a waste I\nam.\"\n\n\"No.  I don't think so.  But I wish you would kiss me.\"\n\nHe rolled back toward her, felt her long and beautiful beside him.  He\nbegan to kiss her, felt something warm at the corner of his eye.\n\n\"Why do you have to go?  Haven't you done enough already?\"\n\n\"Apparently not.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course.  The Belgians and Swiss, and now the Commonwealth.\nThat was your fault, too.\"\n\n\"You don't understand, Elonna.\"\n\n\"What am I supposed to understand?  That your father was a racist\nbastard who didn't love you, or any one or anything else?  That you\ndon't know how to deal with your guilt?  God damn it!  Are you going to\nsacrifice everything we've found, just to satisfy your pride?\"\n\nHe tried to glare at her, turned away and faced the window.  \"I'm so\nglad I could trust you.\"\n\n\"Don't you say that to me!  Don't you dare pretend that you don't care\nabout me.  You didn't bring Johnny and I here just to satisfy your\nconscience and have an exotic fuck.\"  He was silent.\n\n\"What do you want from me?\"\n\n\"I want you to stop KILLING yourself.\"  The emotions of a lifetime\nseemed to be trying to push their way through her throat, the back of\nher eyes.  \"DAMN you.  Aren't there enough things out there to destroy\nus.....  I want you to find another WAY to fight them.\"  As he weakened\nshe started to go to him, checked herself. \n\n\"Listen to me, Morgan.  One more raid isn't going to make a difference\nin this war, one way or another.   It's too big for that now.  But if\nyou're killed it will mean everything to you.....  And to me.\"\n\nThey stood in silence.\n\n*\n\n\nAgain they stood within their chambers beneath the transparent dome on\nthe planet Alba:  early night.   Morgan was preparing to leave.\n\n\"Please don't go.\"  The tears flowed freely down her face.  \"I could\nnever forgive you.\"  The boy, standing by her side, looked at him with\nan angry, puzzled expression.\n\nHe started for the doorway.  Reaching it he stopped, and stood\nperfectly still.  As the battle raged inside him.\n\n\"Morgan, please.\" He turned to face her.  She was love and loss\npersonified.\n\nHis shoulders went limp, and the rifle slid halfway down his arm.  He\nhad never felt so empty.  Twenty seconds.\n\nHe lifted the strap of the rifle, leaned the weapon against the corner\nby the door.  He walked past them and into the bedroom.\n\nUn-shouldering his pack as they followed him in, he unfastened the\nflaps at the top and took something out of it.  Steel hoops on a black\nchain shone silver.  The man placed one cuff around his wrist, hooked\nthe other to the metal bedpost.  He took a set of keys from his pocket.\n. .and threw them across the room.\n\nHe slid to the floor, covered his face with his arm.\n\n\"Morgan,\" she said quietly.  \"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"I love you.\"  His sobs were audible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n........................................................................\n..........................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA WALK THROUGH THE NIGHT\n\nTHERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD POSSIBLY DESCRIBE THIS.

A beautiful dark-eyed Russian woman,\na defector, lived here beneath the shelter of trees.\n\nShe was not alone here.  Other defectors. . .no, patriots.  Bulgarians,\nPoles and others, who loathed their totalitarian masters and the\nbrutality, without freedom, under which their peoples were forced to\nlive, and work away their lives, like ants.  Former high-ranking\nmembers of the government, military, and intelligence branches of the\nEastern bloc and the Soviet Union.  KGB.  Here they lived in close\ncommunion, despite the danger, working sometimes with the West,\nsometimes without it, according to their skills, to undermine the iron\ngrip of the communist leadership, to encourage and protect dissidents,\nand to publish their work both home and abroad.  As well as other goals\nthat were more immediately humane.\n\nIt was not a place loved by the Kremlin or the East German puppets, the\nloyal KGB.  Many times assassins, head hunters had been sent, either to\ninfiltrate or destroy the traitorous band.  But so far as could be\ntold, under the watchful and knowing eyes of Sonya Semenov, herself a\nformer agent, none had yet succeeded their aim.  And those who had\ntried, the captured, sure of death, had not been executed, or even\nturned over to the west. Instead they were sent back unharmed, with no\ngreater injury than the knowledge that a hated sect had shown them\nmercy, and (to some) disquieting questions about their own loyalty and\ncourage.\n\nFor mistress Semenov, the former operative, used methods of testing\nthat were quite unique.  Those who arrived at the Villa under pretense\nof defection, always suspect, were kept alone in a basement cell, of\ndrab cement, for two days and nights without food or water.  Their only\ncontact with the world outside was a tiny, barred window that looked\nout on a beautiful garden, filled with birds.  This window was kept\nshuttered, blocking out all light and sound, but for five minute\nperiods twice daily.  At all other times the cell was dark, cool and\nsilent.  There was no bed, nor any comfort to be found.\n\nOn the third day a single cup of water was brought, and the steel\nshutters remained closed.  At intervals, moving pictures were projected\nfrom a square opening onto the opposing wall of gray:  scenes from the\nHolocaust, the American bombing of Hiroshima, the torture and later\nexecution of a 'dissident' during the Stalin era.  Grim portraits with\nno clear political message or theme, except that of human suffering.\nAlways suffering.\n\nAfter two more days of this an evening meal was brought, along with\nwater and wine, by one of the women (or men) of the allegiance.  A\ncomfortable bed was made of a mattress against the hard floor.  The\nwindow was opened and she (or he), the deliverer, remained for the\nnight:  kissing, massaging aching limbs, making love.  The entire\nritual was then repeated.  Afterwards, the pledge was sent to a small\ncabin in the woods, given food, drink and writing materials, and told\nto return in three weeks time.\n\nThe final test, after the writing had been studied by. . .was making\nlove to Sonya Semenov. . .the group.....  Making love. . .and love. . .\nkissing, massaging.....  Sonya Semenov.....\n\n\"Sonya.\"\n\nThe man stirred, but did not wake, in his sleep.  The sensations,\nphysical, of his love seemed to fade.  They faded.  And as he sank back\nthe dream began again, at the beginning.  But this time he was Sonya\nSemenov, a man, and a dark-haired Hungarian woman had come to them,\nescaped from the life of concubine to a ranking member of the\nPresidium, as she explained to the others.  Wearing a deep melancholy,\nwhose depth was still greater for the pain in her large eyes, which\ncould hide nothing of what she felt, whom he trusted instantly, or\nwould have, except that he was Sonya Semenov, and life had taught him\nnot to trust.\n\nShe was put to the test, and every minute he hovered like an angel\nabove her, seeing her pain, in the merciless concrete room, her great\nand caring heart that had been so maimed, and always wanting her,\nwanting to disband, destroy the test, because she was so beautiful and\nincapable of anything but truth.  Wanting her, and loving her more and\nmore.  And when she went into the woods his spirit followed her, and\nthe poetry she wrote, which spoke of suffering, the suffering of\nothers, he felt because of her.  And he loved her still more and she\nwas everything that he had never found after an eternity.   And after\nan eternity she returned from those woods, made magic by her presence,\nwhose green leaves lifted for her in the wind and turned their light\nundersides like Spring, the dark green returning like deepest summer as\nshe came back to them.  The Villa.  And those who questioned her he\nwanted to kill but mostly only wanted her and needed to be with her.\nWanting her, and the time of their joining drew near and he knew she\nwould make love to her, Sonya, and he prayed in his sleep that the\ndream would not fade.\n\nAnd at the last she came to him.  In the beautiful dying light of the\nday, she lifted away her garment and stood shimmering by the open door\nof the balcony, as the wind kissed her hair and rustled the leaves in\nthe high branches and she trembled slightly.  And he was a woman once\nmore, in love and then a man, and they kissed as their breasts touched\nthrough long hair and they stood in glorious nakedness and nothing held\nback.  And he led her to the bed and laid her down and made the\nsweetest, purest love, giving her everything so gently as she quietly\ngroaned and still the pain was in her face but now a different kind of\npain, and he loved her as he had never loved and would never love\nagain, touch-kissing her breasts and pouring out his soul.  And as the\nlove consumed and soon would be incarnate he closed his eyes.  He was\nSonya, and his lover lifted something that gleamed a little and seemed\nso unnatural, and stabbed her throat.\n\nAnd Sonya Semenov was dead, killed by a Russian assassin, in the year\n1989.\n\n*\n\nSalnikov woke in a cold sweat, as his memory raced to put back the\npieces of history and dream.  KGB.  He shuddered, because he knew it\nwas true.\n\n\n\n\n........................................................................\n............................\n\n\n\nACT THREE\n\nAndromeda, Balthazar, Cerberus, Gorky and Larkspur Sectors\nMonths VI through XII\nInternational Year:  2211\n\n\nSAHARA OF SNOW\n\nI\n\nOn June 6, 2211 (by Euro-American dating) an open letter was sent to\nthe President and Congress of the United Commonwealth by Gen. Charles\nWilliam Hayes, then acting as its Secretary of State.  On June 12 it\nwas read to a specially convened Joint Session by Defense Secretary\nAaron Brown, himself a distinguished veteran.  Copies of the transcript\nwere then made available to the press.  The President did not attend\nthe reading.\n\n\nMy Fellow Americans:\n\nWe have embarked upon a Great Crusade.  On May the 30th, under my\ndirection and leadership, The Third Fleet, in conjunction with the\nforces of the Democratic Alliance of Belgium and Switzerland, engaged\nand defeated the combined fleets of the Communist Coalition before the\nstar system commonly known as Tarkus Minor, thus achieving the\nliberation of its peoples, who have labored so long under the\noppressive yoke of Marxism.\n\nIn the wake of its dictatorial regime we have established democracy:  a\nprovisional government under the auspices of the Belgians and Swiss.\nThough this outside hand in the political affairs of another nation is\nregrettable, it must be remembered the that inhabitants of these\ncolonies, though proud and courageous, have been kept in the darkness\nof atheistic communist doctrines for many years, and that some will not\nat first be willing, over even able, to accept the blessings of true\nfreedom.  The freedom of thought, speech and worship which we enjoy,\nwill at first seem strange and painful to them, just as dazzling\nsunlight is painful to the eyes of one long imprisoned beneath the\nground.  But just as the doctor's slap which startles the new-born\nchild to life, though sudden and unexpected, is wholly necessary and\nthe catalyst to a new life, so these first steps toward democracy,\nhowever painful, must be taken boldly and resolutely.\n\nAnd this victory is but the beginning.  For the first time in nearly\nthree centuries, we are given the power to rid the cosmos forever of\nthe spreading and malignant cancer of communism.  Not since 1946 at\nMalta, when our predecessors, out of blindness and misguided\ncompassion, declined to use the birth of nuclear weapons to rid Eastern\nEurope of the Soviets---Slavic hordes which would dominate her peoples\nto this day---have we been given the necessary tactical advantage to\nrealize this great dream.  Once again we have the capability to strike\nand overwhelm in the same motion.\n\nIt has been said that those who do not learn from the mistakes of\nhistory are doomed to repeat them.  Never has there been a clearer or\nmore urgent example.  We must not let faltering spirit and moral\nweakness send us down that same cowardly and shameful road.  We must\nnot let this second opportunity pass!  For God has delivered into our\nhands, and at the precise moment, a weapon which makes the defenses of\nour enemies useless, and his attempts to thwart our offensive thrusts,\nutterly futile.\n\nI speak of the Clarke-Medvekian 'Star Gate' potential, perfected only\nrecently by our gallant scientists at the Top Secret laboratories of\nMobius VI.  I speak of it openly now, since to our enemies it is no\nlonger a fearful rumor, but deadly reality.  With it we are able to\nmove our omnipotent SuperCarriers (along with escort, if necessary)\nvirtually anywhere in the galaxy, completely undetected, in less time\nthan it takes to lace a boot.  Distance is no longer a deterrent, and\nfuel consumption need only be calculated for the duration of the battle\nitself.  The strongest defense shield is easily breached, since the\nCarrier does not pass 'through' it, but rather, emerges on the other\nside.\n\nBut do not misunderstand my words.  Military secrets are the most\nfleeting of all, and we are far from invincible. . .if we delay.  An\neffective defense or tracking system will inevitably be devised, and\nour ability to strike without warning taken from us.  For this reason,\nas well as others, there is need of haste.  If we do not utilize this\nweapon now, it may well be used against us in the future.\n\nAnd so, my fellow patriots, I ask you for the official power to execute\nthis bold plan, this glorious, God given crusade, proved under\nExecutive Order, and on the field of battle.  Give to me your\nconsensus---a formal Declaration of War on the remaining colonies of\nthe Communist Coalition---and we will begin this first campaign in\nearnest.\n\nI will not deceive you.  Despite the advantages of superior weaponry,\nespecially the stealth and mobility afforded us by Star Gate potential,\nmen's lives will be lost in the cause of lasting peace.  It will not be\nan easy road.  But if we can again find in ourselves that which is\ncourageous and noble---the fighting spirit that won our Independence\nand established the world's first true democracy, and later carried us\nthrough nearly two hundred years of patriotic wars without  a\ndefeat---ours will be hailed as the greatest era known by man, the\nGolden Age of Liberty.  It will be remembered as a time when freedom\nloving peoples everywhere, their hearts aflame with the glory of the\ntask, rose up to expel forever the totalitarian Marxists, and tear free\nfrom all the galaxy the shackles of dictatorial communism.\n\nLastly, let me apologize if my words are not fair, my manner of speech\nunsubtle.  I am neither orator nor philosopher, but a plain thinking\nChristian general of Southern stock, born on the Earth, proud of my\nroots and my heritage.\n\nBut let none doubt my integrity and insight on this matter, which I\nhave studied closely, and made my life's work.  For God does not always\nchoose the sophisticated or genteel to do His holy bidding.  Like\nGeorge Washington before me, I do not pretend to know all the\nsubtleties of diplomacy and constitution which lie before us, only the\ntrue and unalterable road which our armies must follow to secure the\nliberty and prosperity of future generations.\n\nWith your blessing I will carry our proud banner to heights our\nforefathers could not have dreamed, and the God-given torch which they\npassed down to us shall not diminish, but shine from every corner of\nthe galaxy, eternal beacon of peace and freedom.\n\nI know in my heart that you will hear my entreaty, and grant me the\nmoment for which I am destined.\n\nGod bless America!\n\n\n\nYours in Liberty,\n\nGen. Charles William Hayes\nSecretary of State\n\n\nAmong the inaccuracies and half-truths contained in the Secretary's\ncall to arms were the following, pointed out by some, but not generally\nregarded as important.\n\n1)  General Hayes referred to the 'Communist Coalition' as if it were a\nsingle nation.  Its actual name was The Coalition of Independent\nSocialist States, and it was not a nation at all, but rather a military\nalliance, similar to NATO.\n\n2)  He spoke of having 'engaged and defeated the combined fleets' of\nthe Coalition, when in fact he had only beaten the Tri-Colony Defense\nForce under Col. Ivan Dubcek, already weakened by the frontal assaults\nof the Belgians and Swiss.  The Coalition First Command Fleet, under\nthe command of Gen. Helmut Itjes, had engaged the enemy in defensive\nskirmishes only, holding its own while evacuating roughly one-third of\nthe inhabitants of the planets Premislyde and Goethe.  Athena II,\nbecause of its proximity to the American thrust, was wholly lost.\n\n3)  The Athena Star System had not been referred to as Tarkus Minor for\nnearly eighty years, since an earlier error in mapping had been\ncorrected.  Perhaps the reference to Athens was uncomfortable for\nHayes---the fact that a 'dictatorial regime' had chosen not to alter\nthe name---or perhaps it threatened his claim that the United States\nhad been the first true democracy.  The argument that Greek Athens was\nnot wholly democratic because it relied on the use of slave labor made\nlittle difference, since 18th Century America also kept slaves.\n\n4)  Whether or not the Commonwealth Supercarriers were omnipotent\nremained to be seen, since not all functions had been tested under full\ncombat conditions.  The Soviets were also said to possess four very\nlarge and formidable carriers.\n\n5)  The metaphor comparing the use of star-gate potential to the lacing\nof a boot was a good one---the time required for the final passage was\nrelatively slight---but it neglected one very important step.  First\none had to construct the boot.  Star-gate potential was not some\nmagician's trick.  The commander of a fleet could not simply press a\nbutton and 'poof', make his ships appear in another part of the galaxy.\n The creation of the star-gate was a very real, and therefore\ncomplicated process.  Reduced to layman's terms, it utilized principals\nof anti-matter similar to those found in the implosion of a star (thus\nforming a black hole), to forge a corridor between two given points in\nSpace, thus cheating the normal laws of space and time.  Preparing such\na corridor could take days, away from any kind of supporting base,\npossibly weeks.\n\nFor this reason one had to be certain he could defeat his enemy upon\narrival, and control the designated area (or be prepared to retreat by\nconventional means) before any attack could be considered.  In short,\nas an offensive weapon it was virtually unstoppable; but it offered\nabsolutely nothing in the way of defense.\n\n6)  The Secretary referred to the Soviets of the 1940's as 'Slavic\nhordes which would dominate Eastern Europe.....'  In fact the Slavs had\ndominated it for some time, having settled there centuries before, and\nforming a large segment of the population.  Coincidentally, the\nexpression 'Slavic hordes' had first been popularized by Nazi German\npropagandists, just prior to the outbreak of World War II.\n\n7)  Hayes' reference to the Yalta Conference of 1945 was confused at\nbest.  While this historic meeting of Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin\nmay have anticipated (in Stalin's mind only) the Soviet occupation of\neastern Europe at the end of World War II, work on the atomic bomb had\nnot yet been completed, and the Western powers were in no position\neither to divine Stalin's ultimate goal, or to prevent it through the\nuse of nuclear weapons.\n\n8)  According to protocol, only the President could ask Congress for a\nDeclaration of War.  Also, by attacking the colonies without a 'formal\ndeclaration', General Hayes had violated International Law.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThat these distortions were not looked upon with gravity by the\nAmerican public, can perhaps be attributed to the social conditions\nprevalent at the time.  Largely a cultural island, despite its vast\ntrade and high international standing, the United Commonwealth had\ndeveloped national characteristics not wholly conducive to truth and\nperspective.\n\nFor example, if the average American saw a historical character (say\nAbraham Lincoln) portrayed in a popular movie or book, it became set in\nhis or her mind that he/she now possessed a complete understanding of\nboth the man himself, and the tempestuous events in which he took part.\n Thus, any subsequent input of contradictory facts or unclear morals\nwas discounted.  Because as a general rule what appeared visually or in\nprint, larger (and often better) than life, seemed infinitely more real\nand comprehensible than the confusing puzzle of actual events.  The\nfact that Hayes presented his version of the truth in a frank,\nstraightforward manner (why would he lie?) also tended to work in his\nfavor, lulling to sleep---they were barely awake to begin with---the\ndeeper sensibilities of his countrymen.\n\nAnd in truth very little was known about the Battle of Athena.  The\nCommonwealth forces who had taken part in the mission were sworn to\nsecrecy, denied direct communication, and there was no way to obtain\nmore complete, unbiased information.  Also, since it happened far away\nand no casualties were announced, it all seemed less a prelude to\nactual war than some vaguely exciting patriotic adventure and (to the\npress) the possibility of some first-rate news footage.\n\nThis is not to say that all Americans were this bland or naive.  Very\nvocal opposition arose at once, along with equally vocal support.  But\nhere again, the popular opinion of the middle class was the real power\nin the Commonwealth, and for the most part this bulk society had not\nyet made up its mind.  Most were still, at the core, opposed to\nbloodshed.  But the economy WAS in difficult straits, which tended to\nmake them angrier and more aggressive, and there WERE nasty rumors\ncirculating about Soviet preparations for a military push in the\nquadrant.  That military preparedness was standard Soviet policy, and\nthat the grimmest predictions often came from Pentagon propagandists,\nwas to many either unknown, or considered beside the point.\n\nThe puzzle, however, was why the President had not attended the\nreading, and for the time being refused all comment.  A press\nconference had been scheduled for June 18, but beyond this\nAdministration officials were maintaining an uncanny, and therefore\ndisquieting silence.  Some of the more astute political observers and\nhigh-ranking members of the government may have guessed what this mean,\nbut if so they did not give voice to their conclusions.\n\nBecause if what they suspected was true, it pointed to a serious rift\nwithin the government, and a potential problem far more dangerous than\nthe stealing of a few planets, give or take.  (Almost no one believed\nthat Hayes actually intended to take on the whole of socialism,\nespecially Soviet Space ---quiet of late, but still quite capable of\nfireworks of their own).  In this, unfortunately, they underestimated\nthe depths of the man's obsession, and gave him credit for a sense of\nmoderation which he did not possess.\n\nAnd so the issue was roundly debated by the public and the press, and\neveryone waited impatiently for the President to address the issue, if\nonly to have a focal point for their anger or support.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe President, however, had received on June 5 a very different\ncommunication from his Secretary of State, and was in a quandary as to\nhow to respond.  Because the one outright lie of General Hayes' letter\nto Congress and the press, had been that he attacked the Czech/East\nGerman joint colonies under Executive Order.  In fact, he had done it\nentirely on his own.\n\nStill retaining his rank (an oddity in high political service) as a\nfive-star general, and thus the most powerful man within the military\nestablishment, Hayes was trying to use his popularity as a war hero,\nand his considerable influence among the Armed Forces, to blackmail the\nPresident into a military venture on which he had long vacillated.  The\ndoubly coded message read as follows.\n\n*\n\n\nDear Mr. President:\n\nThe time for indecision has passed.  The battle is won; star-gate\npotential is a reality; and the spirits of the men are high.  Such\ntimes as these are rare, when patriotic fervor at home is matched by\nclear superiority in the field.\n\nBut I won't try to sway you with words.  You know the pressing\nrealities as well as I do.  I ask you now to put aside our past\ndifferences, and give me your full support.  We can annihilate the\nremaining communist holdings in Balthazar and Cerberus and proceed from\nthere.  But IT MUST BE NOW.  \n\nI am sorry to have to force the issue, attacking on my own.  But as a\nman who loves my country and sees the future clearly, you left me no\nchoice.  With Bacon and Weiss (Presidential advisors) still squabbling,\nand your own will paralyzed, precious and irrecoverable time was\nslipping by.  And as for securing appropriations from the\nliberal-controlled House without bringing tremendous political pressure\nto bear.....\n\nBut I won't banter.  Nothing cuts through barriers or rouses the people\nlike a successful military engagement.  And as I have said before, our\ntactical advantage will not last.  You may have backed the Russians\ndown of late with tough talk, but they haven't been idle the past three\nyears either.  And unlike our attempts at rearmament, they aren't\nhindered by the need for Congressional approval, or any other such\nbleeding heart nonsense.  The Star Gate is our edge, and it won't be\nlong before the enemy either finds a defense, or masters the principle\nhimself.  I've ordered everyone directly involved with the project sent\nto Mobius and quarantined for a year, under the pretense of a possible\nepidemic.  But that doesn't keep information from being smuggled out.\n\nAnd please don't deceive yourself, Edgar.  Once the Russians get this\ntechnology they'll use it.  This is going to be a volatile and\nturbulent era, whether we choose to make the first move or not.  Either\nwe put this weapon to use, or it will be used against us.\n\nBut we've been through all this before.  I will send my appeal to\nCongress and the people, then the choice will be yours.  You can give\nme your full support, and be remembered for all times as a courageous\nand decisive leader, or you can disown me and face the consequences.\nThere is no middle ground.\n\nGive me your blessing!  You are a great and proud American; your\nprinciples are high and your intentions unimpeachable.  The only fault\nI have ever found with you is a continuing desire to be advised, and a\ndeep hesitation to go against the grain of your advisers, even when\nthey themselves are undecided.  History does not wait for the whims of\nsuch men!  One either takes the reins of Destiny, or they are taken\nfrom him.\n\nYou say you did not ascend to the presidency alone---that many men with\nmany causes helped elect you.  That is true, and your magnanimity is\nadmirable.  But you are still the President, and the most powerful man\nin the free world.  I urge you now:  use that power!  Stand on your own\nand be counted.  Put your faith in me, and you shall never regret it.\n\nForgive me for speaking so plainly.  These are convictions that run\nvery deep in me.  I ask only this:  that you listen to your heart.  You\nwill see that I am right, and that God has chosen me to do His holy\nwork.\n\nYour Servant,\n\nCharles William Hayes\nSecretary of State\n\nP.S.-  I have spoken with the Joints Chiefs of Staff.  They stand\nbehind me.\n\n\n*\n\n\nAnd so the President, who was not fond of making difficult decisions\n---Hayes had been quite right in this assertion---was faced with the\nmost difficult choice of his political career, if not his life.  Though\nfar from a genius, he clearly saw (and this in itself was unusual) that\na true, life and death dilemma lay before him, and that his decision\nwould directly affect the lives of millions of people.  Did he give in\nto political blackmail, and condone self-righteous slaughter---a\ngenuine war?  Or did he call Hayes' bluff, and find out just how\npowerful the man had become?  Either path presented equally grim\nscenarios.  And for the first time in his illustrious presidency, Edgar\nJ. Stone found himself in a position where advice was useless, and\ncompromise impossible.\n\nHis political forte' to this point had been to make no rash decisions\nor statements to the press, and to defer to his advisers on the more\nserious matters of state.  And through a combination of conservative\ndogma and hard-nosed pragmatism, he had heretofore been extraordinarily\nsuccessful, getting most of his programs through Congress, avoiding\nembarrassment, and heading off political difficulty before it gained\nimpetus.  No matter what the circumstance, he always managed to appear\ncalm and well informed, with just enough below-the-surface anger to let\neveryone know, especially the Soviets, that the Commonwealth was not to\nbe made sport of or taken lightly (which of course appealed to the\ncurrent patriotic mood of his countrymen).\n\nHe was neither smarter, shrewder, nor more capable than his recent\npredecessors.  If anything, he was less qualified than most.  But he\ndid have one skill they lacked.  He knew how to play the game, and he\nlied (to no one more than to himself) with great conviction.\n\nBecause in the Commonwealth politicians were judged not so much by what\nthey did, as by the way they appeared to be doing it.  Lincoln, Kennedy\nand Reagan were remembered as the greatest of men, though they\nseriously mishandled important matters of state, largely because, as\nthe poetic put it, \"They captured the spirit of their countrymen.\"\nMore cynically, they gave good speeches.  Edgar Stone, though\nconsiderably less moral than any but the third, understood this (or\nsomething like it), and with the aid of the power groups he\nrepresented, had modeled his administration accordingly.\n\nHe did this by surrounding himself with strong and intelligent men who\nunderstood the inner workings of government, economy and diplomacy,\nconcentrating his own energies---with the help of various acting\ncoaches and speech writers---on the subtleties of image and\nappearances.  His was the mask worn by those who had elected him, and\nthose who held real power.  Not only did he fail to question the\nmorality of the policies they had him put forward, but in truth, was\nnot particularly interested.  He had for nearly twenty years made his\nliving as a front-man for conservative causes, knew his job and stuck\nto it.  And having for so long been immersed in right wing-propaganda\n(it also appealed to his ego and warped sense of patriotism), he really\ndid, or certainly appeared, to believe it himself.  Thus the last and\nmost important element of the facade fell into place:  'sincerity'.\n\nAny seasoned political observer (who cared to look with his eyes) could\nsee this, and yet few with any authority chose to attack the graven\nimage.  Why?  Because he SEEMED to be doing a good job, and was (in the\npersona that had so been carefully been constructed) a pleasant,\nhard-working and respectable family man.  The fact that he had changed\nprofessions (a former salesman), parties (a former Democrat), and wives\n(a divorcee), was routinely shouted down as liberal mud-slinging.  The\npress was cowed by his popularity, the opposition by the power it gave\nhim.  The middle class LIKED Edgar Stone, and big business stood behind\nhim.  It was a formidable combination.  No chink had yet been found in\nhis armor, and the political sharks that arise within any system,\ndemocratic or otherwise, could not yet smell blood in the water.\n\nBut all that careful work and planning was now being swept away by a\nsingle, unforeseeable mistake.  Over the years Stone had accumulated\nnumerous political debts, especially to those who had kept him going\nduring the lean years of 'progressive humanism', one of which he had\nrepaid by appointing a pompous, self-indulging and wholly unqualified\n'hero' of the Nibian Wars (like Ulysses S. Grant, he had sent tens of\nthousands to their graves without blinking), and a man he personally\ndisliked, as his Secretary of State.  Charles William Hayes.\n\nLike Douglas Macarthur before him, Hayes had given innumerable signs of\nthe obsession he now sought to enact.  But like so many other men of\nhistory who are not taken at their word (Adolph Hitler being perhaps\nthe clearest, and most horrific example), people had always assumed\nthat he took such a hard line against socialism (as Hitler had done\nagainst the Jews) simply to encourage those who could elevate him to\npower, and to tap into the volatile anger and frustration of his\ncountrymen.\n\nBut the truly frightening thing about such men, Hayes included, was\nthat THEY MEANT EVERY WORD THEY SAID.  \"Better dead than Red,\" an\nexpression borrowed from the Cold War days of the mid twentieth\ncentury, was not just a slogan to him, but unwritten Holy Scripture,\nhanded down to him by the righteous God who ruled the Universe and\ncalled men of courage and action to his service, in the unending war\nagainst this modern day Satan.  Etc.  In his mind, too simple or too\nstubborn to possess any clear sense of perspective, this same God\ndirected his every footstep, living within him and guiding his\nthoughts.  And anyone who stood in his way, or questioned his narrow\nvision, was either weak, blind, or the enemy.  As he had intimated in\nhis letter to Stone, so far as he was concerned, there was no 'middle\nground' in anything.\n\nAnd in classic Shakespearean form, the inevitably tragic events of his\nlife had only served to bear out his convictions, and reinforce his\nMessianic image of himself.  Indeed, given the power of his obsession\nand the unyielding pursuit of an aggressive, self-chosen destiny, they\ncould hardly have done otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nSo Edgar Stone brooded, and listened to his advisers argue, and tried\nto think.  While the winds of war swirled around him.\n\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nOn the three socialist planets now occupied by the Belgians and Swiss,\nthe process of political arrest, judgment and exile had already begun.\nThe process was especially swift and unyielding on Athena, where nearly\neighty percent of the inhabitants, considered either dangerous or\nunnecessary to the occupation, were to be transported to the newly\nconstructed facilities of the Belgian prison planet, Dracus IIa.\n\nTrue to their word, the arrests were made without violence.  Families\nwere kept together whenever possible (except where a father, husband or\nwife was needed to operate high-tech equipment, thought-controlled\nmachinery or the like), and all were given suitable quarters while\nawaiting the transport ships that would take them to Dracus.  They were\ntold that upon arrival they would be given the resources to feed,\nclothe, and govern themselves, and that no harm would come to those who\ncooperated.  The Alliance had no intention of turning public opinion\nagainst itself, or calling to anyone's mind (especially their own) the\nbarbarities and prison-camp horrors of previous wars.\n\nTheir plan was simple.  Send all undesirables and non-essential\npersonnel to secretly located prison planets deep within their\nboundaries, give them the tools they needed to survive, cut off all\ncommunication, and simply leave them there.  When the war was over\nthere would be time to consider a more permanent solution.\n\nAnd at the moment there were more pressing matters at hand.  First they\nhad to ascertain exactly who it was they were fighting, and why---since\nclearly they didn't share Hayes' obsession, and intended to act wholly\nindependent of him.\n\nHere were the facts as they saw them.\n\nThe Dutch Provinces, long coveted, were now in their possession, along\nwith the Athena colonies.  Their strength, especially monetary, had\ngrown because of it.  There was no substantial inter-galactic outcry\nagainst them, their own activities being largely overshadowed by the\npossibility of a full-scale offensive push by the Commonwealth.  And\ntheir losses to date, though somewhat more substantial than they had\nhoped, could not outweigh their ambition.  Except for the German-made\ncarrier, which they had not expected to lose, the fleet sent against\nDubcek had been manned by robot crews only, the idea being to exchange\nhardware, which could be replaced, for the bounty of Athena.  They had\neven taken a new, bi-national symbol, the pouncing leopard, and had it\nemblazoned on their ships, and on the sleeves of all their flyers.\n\nBut what they should have known, what every leopard does know, is that\nthey were not the only, nor indeed the most powerful predator in the\nbush.  The stir created by a kill may be tolerated once by the pride of\nlions living nearby.  But soon both predator and prey are aware of\ntheir existence, ready to act upon it, and even the distraction of a\nrogue elephant, crashing blindly through the brush, can't hide its\npresence for long.\n\nTheir fight had only just begun.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThe morning of June 17, on the eve of his scheduled press conference to\naddress the issue, Edgar Stone sat behind his desk in the Oval Office,\nstaring blankly at his fourth attempt to draft a reply to General\nHayes.  Dark circles pulled at his eyes and sinuses; his head felt like\na warm stone that wouldn't think.  Half an hour earlier, after\nlistening to his top advisers swear at each other with the same\narguments they had been postulating for months, he had done something\nhe would not have dreamed of in other circumstances.  He had told them\nall to \"Shut up,\" and unceremoniously shown them the door.\n\nFor the first time in his presidency he was taking matters into his own\nhands, with more than a few regrets and second thoughts.  He had slept\nbadly or not at all for three nights running, and felt neither brave,\nnor noble, nor even competent to make such a choice.  In his current\nframe of mind he was incapable of realizing the human or historical\nsignificance of the crisis that lay before him, and at the moment this\nwas not what mattered.  Unlike Hayes, he didn't give a damn what people\nthought once he was dead, or even out of office.  What mattered now was\nthat his tolerance for bullshit had been long since used up---that he\nwas furious at being put in such a position.\n\nAnd somewhere, very deep inside himself he knew, though he shrank from\nthe knowledge, that something very wrong had happened, that the damage\nwas far from over, and that he was partly to blame.  And he knew one\nmore thing, despite the rhetoric that he had spouted for two decades:\noffensive war, unduly considered, was the basest and most shameful of\nhuman endeavors, never justifiable, and rarely, in the end,\naccomplishing anything.\n\nBecause for all his faults, and these he possessed in abundance, Edgar\nStone was not insane.\n\nHe bowed very low, crumpling the paper before him in both hands.  Shook\nhis head mournfully.  He pushed the com-button on his desk and summoned\na secretary, to whom he dictated his answer to Hayes.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe press conference was postponed without a future date being set, on\nthe pretext that new information had just come to light, which must be\nrelayed to the Secretary of State before further action could be taken.\n But even the impassable Bill Miller, Stone's Press Secretary, could\nnot pull off this announcement without incurring a barrage of stupefied\nquestions and dissatisfied remarks.\n\nAnd when news of the postponement spread, along with the undercurrent\nof confusion and subdued alarm which accompanied it, even the dullest\nAmericans began to sense that something was amiss---that real life had\nsomehow crept onto the peaceful shores of their island.  And nearly all\nwere aware of a strange thrill of fear as their President finally\nstepped before the cameras on July 15, looking not at all like himself.\n\n\n\n*                        *                        *\n\n\nOn June 24, the day that Hayes received the President's reply, the\nThird Fleet was once again preparing to go into action.  The\ncoordinates (and victim) of their next attack had already been decided\nupon, known only to the General Staff, and to the scientists in charge\nof constructing the star gate.  All the myriad ships---destroyer\ngroups, flotillas and task forces, still intact---were once more\nhuddled within the massive body of the Supercarrier 'Dreadnought',\nitself nearly forty kilometers from stem to stern.\n\nThe mother vessel, with all its destructive children tucked up inside,\nand therefore vulnerable (relatively speaking) to sudden attack, had\nbeen positioned by her masters in the place that this was least likely\nto occur---a distant orbit around the sea planet Goethe, where Alliance\nships moved constantly, ready to repel any attempt at a counter-stroke\nby the Coalition.  The entrance to the star gate was being constructed\noutside the extremities of the system, far beyond the considerable pull\nof the massive star, Athena.\n\nThough the two capitalist fleets remained in constant contact, it was\nunderstood that there would be no mutual effort or coordinated defense\nonce the Dreadnought left the system.  The two sides had gotten what\nthey wanted:  the Belgians and Swiss the riches of the colonies, as\nwell as the threat of a powerful ally, and the Commonwealth, an easy\nvictory with a minimum of casualties.  Thus the thief and the bully\nwould part.\n\nBoth sides, meanwhile, were concerned (at least Hayes pretended to be)\nby the external calm and relative inaction on the part of the\nCoalition, and the still more ominous silence of Soviet Space.  In his\nmore lucid moments the Secretary realized the strength of his ultimate\nfoe:  that a great bear waited for him deep in the woods, and that\nkilling it, even with the full weight of the Commonwealth behind him,\nwould be no easy task.  But for now he feared nothing and no one.\n\nONE STEP AT A TIME, he told himself.  One step at a time.\n\n\n*\n\n\nIt was late afternoon, U.C. Earth time, though that measure seemed\nquite meaningless while circling a planet of turbulent seas two hundred\ntimes Earth's mass, dotted with tiny islands rising thousands of feet\nabove the wrack, itself revolving around a sun not to be spoken in the\nsame breath with our own.\n\nLeif Janson felt this lapse of human significance acutely, as he paced\nback and forth in Communications Room One, waiting for the approaching\nmessage from the diminutive planet which had spawned him.  Even aboard\nthe Dreadnought, dwarfed as it was by everything around it, this\nfeeling of smallness and mock importance would not leave him.\n\nHe recalled the words of Joseph Conrad, describing the way the primeval\nforests of Africa must have looked upon the coming of the white man to\nsteal its ivory.  \"Fantastic invasion.\"  And so it seemed to him now.\nHow could man even pretend to dominate such a Universe, in which his\nunnoticed presence, lasting but the blink of an eye, could not begin to\ncompare with the Infinity which his mind could not even comprehend?\nAll that a man could ever hope to do was live in peace with himself,\nand understanding with his neighbors.  And of late the Commonwealth had\ndone a damned poor job of that.  To find love, and to pass that love on\nto his children.....\n\n\"Major Janson.\"  He turned.  \"Message coming in.\"\n\n\"Good.  Get it recorded then go below.  Lieutenant Frye, contact the\nSecretary and ask him to come down right away.  Tell him the message is\nin, and that I've cleared the com room.  Then report to your quarters\nand await further instructions.\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\nSeveral minutes later Janson stood alone beside the main decoding\ncomputer, listening to the drum of approaching footsteps.  General\nHayes strode into the room with the same expression of confident,\naggressive attention that he always wore, perhaps pulled a bit tighter\nabout the cheekbones by tension and desire.\n\nWith him were two other men:  Brigadier General Michael Calder, his\nright-hand man for the last twenty years, and Gen-Admiral Frank,\ncommander of the Third Fleet, also a long-time associate.  The\nSecretary, choosing for the moment to don civilian clothes, addressed\nthe middle-aged (and therefore to his eyes, young) Communications\nOfficer directly.\n\n\"Well, Major.  Is the message fully recorded?  Have you followed my\ninstructions to the letter?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.  Shall I begin decoding?\"\n\nJanson held this important, sensitive post because of his high security\nclearance, his steady, if not outstanding career, and most of all, his\nability not to speak of his work to anyone, anytime, under any\ncircumstances.  Frank, therefore, saw nothing unusual in the question.\nBut Hayes looked hard at the man, as if searching for some tell-tale\nflaw.\n\n\"What is your security clearance, major?\"\n\n\"1-A, to military level Five, sir.\"\n\n\"And how many years have you served with us?\"\n\n\"Twenty-three, sir.\"\n\n\"Then you saw action in the Manxsome conflict?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\n\"Decorated?\"\n\n\"No sir.\"\n\nHayes turned to the Fleet Commander.\n\n\"Can you vouch for this man?\"\n\n\"Yes, General.\"  Hayes gave the man a last, hard look, almost a threat.\n\nVery well then, Major.  Begin decoding.\"\n\nFrightened and annoyed, Janson sealed the enclosure, shut down all\noutside terminal linkage, and programmed the series of computers for\nself-erase.  There would be but a single copy of the transcript,\nprinted on thin, white computer paper.  He worked the fingerboards\nrapidly, knowing the codes and counter-codes by rote, until a soft blue\nlight indicated that the signal had been translated and was ready to\nprint.\n\nAnd then he made the mistake of his life.  Simply not thinking to do\notherwise, he touched the print button, and the machine began to feed\nout paper.  It stopped.\n\n\"Is that the reply from Stone?\" asked Hayes severely.  Janson, who had\nbeen walking towards him with the paper in hand, stopped suddenly, and\nhis limbs were awash in adrenalin.\n\n\"Why, yes sir.....  I never thought.  That is.  Anyone could have\npushed the print button.  I merely assumed.....  I haven't read a word,\nMr. Secretary, I swear it.\"  Hayes lowered his head, assumed a more\nnatural expression.  Took the paper from him.\n\n\"Very well, major.  That will be all.\"\n\nJanson saluted and left the room.  Hayes, inclining his head as a\nsignal for his two subordinates to go stand by the door, sat down and\nbegan to read.\n\n\n\n\n\nSecretary Hayes:\n\nI have agonized over the wording of my response to you, though I knew\nright away what my answer should be.  As you asked, though you may not\nbelieve it, I have silenced my advisers and listened to my own\nthoughts.  Perhaps you don't think much of me as a leader, or even a\nman.  But as you yourself said, I am the President, and I see now that\na great deal depends on my dealings with you.  It is also clear that I\nmust carry the brunt of this responsibility myself.  At such a time I\nfeel very small and unprepared.  But whatever else you may think of me,\nI am not a coward.\n\nI have made my decision, Charles, and I ask in turn that you consider\nyour next move very carefully.  Much more depends on it than your ego\nor mine.  AT THIS POINT HAYES SCOWLED, AND UNCONSCIOUSLY WORKED THE\nMUSCLES AT THE BACK OF HIS JAW.  I have not revealed to the public any\naspect of the rift between us, nor will I do so in the future, so long\nas we can now resolve our differences.\n\nI'm trying to be diplomatic.  But since I know you take that as a sign\nof weakness, I will come to the point.\n\nYou have overstepped your authority as Secretary of State, attacking on\nyour own the colonies of two nations with whom we are not at war, and\ndeliberately lied in the process, saying that you did so under my\norders.  To view the matter harshly, as you have done to others in the\npast, you have committed treason.\n\nDamn it, Charles!  The military forces of this nation are not your\nprivate army.  Maybe you don't like the way I was elected; maybe you\nthink your ends justify the means.  Maybe you hate my guts.  None of\nthis is important now.  What is important is the political survival of\nthe United Commonwealth, and the sparing of further bloodshed.\n\nPlease, I'm asking you, DON'T DO ANYTHING RASH.  Think the matter\nthrough.  You have made veiled threats to me, which if realized, could\nresult in civil war, or worse.  Do you really want to stage this coup?\nDo you really want to denounce me, your President, and see how much of\ngovernment and the military will stand behind you?  It goes against all\nthe principles of democracy that you profess so loudly.\n\nI am neither historian nor moralist, as you well know, and I am trying\nnot to lose my temper.  But it seems to me that our forefathers, as you\ncall them, set up their system of checks and balances specifically to\nprevent this kind of showdown, and personal grab for power.  And they\nmust have done something right, because our government has lasted,\nintact, for over four hundred years.  Will you tear all that down\nbecause of your obsession with communism?  Even your beloved George\nWashington turned down the chance to be a monarch, saying it was\ncontrary to all that he had fought for.\n\nThere is nothing more I can say but to fully clarify my position, so\nthat there will be no chance of further misunderstanding.\n\nA)  I will not ask Congress for a Declaration of War.  I will say only\nthat your attack on the colonies was the result of miscommunication\nbetween us, and then attempt to make reparation to the provinces of\nDemocratic Germany and Greater Czechoslovakia.  I am prepared to take\nfull responsibility for this 'misunderstanding' myself, so long as your\nexploits stop now.\n\nB)  I will not disown you, as you suggest, nor call your bluff in\npublic.  I am not looking for a fight, nor will I back down from one.\nYou will remain my Secretary of State, but immediately relinquish all\nmilitary title and authority.  I'll not have a maverick heading the\narmed forces of this nation.\n\nC)  My orders to you now, as your Commander-in-Chief, are to break off\nfrom any plans of further adventurism, and return with the Third Fleet\nto Commonwealth space at once.\n\nTHROUGH HIS RAGE, THE SECRETARY HAD SENSE ENOUGH TO REALIZE THAT THIS\nLIST OF DEMANDS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD BY STONE.  FOR ONE\nTHING, THE WORDING WAS MUCH TOO COGENT.  AND IN FACT, IT WAS THE ONE\nPART OF THE LETTER NOT LARGELY INTACT FROM THE PRESIDENT'S ORIGINAL\nDICTATION.  DESPAIRING AT HIS OWN IGNORANCE, AND NOT KNOWING WHOM TO\nTRUST, STONE HAD TURNED TO HIS VICE PRESIDENT, A CAPABLE MAN, WHO AFTER\nLONG AND SECRET CONSULTATION WITH SAM BACON, WHITE HOUSE\nCHIEF-OF-STAFF, HAD WRITTEN THE PARAGRAPH FOR HIM.\n\nYou may consider me a small and weak man.  But I have the power of the\nConstitution behind me.  And we will also see, should you choose to\ndefy me, how the American people, including the military, will react\nwhen they find out they've been lied to, and committed murder on your\nbehalf.\n\nI ask you once again, to be reasonable.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEdgar James Stone\nPresident of the United Commonwealth.\n\n\n\nGeneral Hayes stood perfectly still for perhaps two minutes, holding\nthe piece of paper in his tightly clench hands, looking at the blank\nportion at the top of it with unfocused eyes.  The two lesser generals,\nknowing better, did not interrupt his mediations, but remained silently\nby the door.  Calder knew his master well enough to read the signs of\nrejection, and still greater determination, on his face.  Frank could\nonly stare at the man he both admired and feared, wondering.\n\nAt length the Secretary stirred.\n\n\"Your incinerator, Michael.\"  Calder handed him the tiny device, and\nHayes vaporized the President's message.  He rose.\n\n\"General Frank.  Schedule a meeting of the Staff in ConRoom 16 for 2200\nhours.  I'll address all subcommanders by visual at 0600 tomorrow.\nRequest your communications officer to remain in his quarters until I\nsend for him.  The attack will go on as scheduled.\"\n\nHayes, his thought rebuked, was now going on instinct.  And his\ninstincts always told him to attack.  The three dispersed, and the\nFirst Communications crew, with the exception of Janson, returned to\ntheir posts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are perhaps three basic ways that the human mind reacts when its\nperception of reality, colored by hopes and dreams, is suddenly,\nforcibly confronted.  The first is the way adopted by those who\nacknowledge their own humanity.  This is to take a step back, question\nperspective, yield to some more profound influence, or simply admit\nthat there may be some aspect of the situation not immediately\nunderstood.  In short, it is the realization that life, for good or\nill, is not going to change for them, and that their dreams and\nambitions must be based on reality, or they simply cannot last.\n\nThe second reaction, just as common, may be viewed as the first step\ntoward irrational thinking.  Those who fall into this category, rather\nthan relinquishing the illusion in question, cling the more fiercely to\nit, stubbornly blocking out all contradictory input, and, if necessary,\ndelving into a world of pure fantasy.\n\nThe third reaction, by far the most dangerous, is centered around a\nbelief that the more one's goals and ambitions are resisted, the truer\nand more indisputable the path taken, since clearly they are being\nresisted by evil.  The Devil, and those who serve him, are to blame.\nTherefore the harder the subsequent struggle, the more righteous the\ncause.  Such is the road taken by the political or religious fanatic.\n\nHayes, in his more rational moods, fell into the second category.  When\ndirectly challenged, as he was now, he fell into the third.\n\nThe man remained seated in his quarters, brooding.  All his thought had\nbeen bent so strongly, all his efforts geared so unshakably toward the\nrealization of a single goal---riding the tide of patriotic fervor,\nwith the whole of the Commonwealth behind him, into a grand and\ndecisive campaign against galactic communism---that Stone's rejection\nhad hit him like a physical blow.  Why had his destiny been denied him?\n OR WAS IT A TRIAL OF FAITH?\n\nAnd one more thing troubled him.  He was still sane and noble enough\n(after a fashion) to see that it would indeed be wrong to usurp the\nduly-elected President, fool that he was, and try to seize power by a\nmilitary coup.  This, however, did not keep him from disregarding his\ncurrent orders, which were clearly and dangerously wrong.  Having been\nstripped of its pet fantasy, his mind now seized upon another.\n\nHE WOULD DO IT ALL HIMSELF.  With only the resources and undying\nloyalty of the Third Fleet, he would defeat Soviet Space alone, against\norders---the greatest military feat of all time.  Each disposition\nwould have to be perfect, each soldier's skill and determination honed\nto a cutting edge of steel.  AGAINST ALL ODDS!  Or, at the very least,\nhe would draw the Soviets into a full-scale war. . .and give his\nreluctant president no choice.....  He got up and began to pace\neagerly, shaking off age and fatigue.\n\nYES, THAT'S IT.  OF COURSE!  HE THINKS HE'S MADE A CLEVER MOVE, CHEATED\nME.  WE'LL SEE HOW LONG THE SOVIETS REMAIN NEUTRAL WHEN I DEVASTATE THE\nCOALITION FORCES, AND KNOCK OUT THE EAST GERMAN HOME PLANET.  \"MORE\nDEPENDS ON IT THAN YOUR EGO OR MINE,\" HE SAID TO ME.  \"TO VIEW THE\nMATTER HARSHLY. . .TREASON!\"  HE'LL 'CALL MY BLUFF', WILL HE?  MY\n'OBSESSION' WITH COMMUNISM.  Hayes smashed a fist into his open hand.\n\"RELINQUISH ALL MILITARY TITLES.\"  \"MAVERICK!.\"  SO HELP ME GOD; IF\nTHIS ACTION ISN'T ENOUGH TO CHANGE HIS MIND, I'LL DO IT.  I'LL COME\nAFTER HIM!  FOOL.  BLIND FOOL.\n\nAt length he ceased his pacing and grew calmer.  The meeting with\nGeneral Staff was approaching, and he must decide what course to take\nwith them:\n\nThe meeting would be held.  He would address the sub-commanders as\nscheduled, as the mighty ship headed out toward the entrance of the\nstar gate.  Nothing had changed.  Stone's actions had been a small\nannoyance, nothing more.  He switched on the dictation machine, and\nbegan speaking rapidly and decisively.\n\n\n\n*                        *                        *\n\n\nLt. Eric Muller had been in e-light warp for almost fifteen hours,\nbarely outraced by the laser sounding-beam sent out ahead of him days\nbefore.\n\nSo far he had been lucky---he had not had to deviate course.  He knew\nthat once he did, leaving the path of the beam, he would have no\nwarning at all before smashing into an unrecorded meteor, or bit of\nspace debris.  To come out of light-speed and fly by sight and\ninstruments meant to expose himself to tracking, almost certain death\nwhile approaching enemy-controlled positions.\n\nThe small, blistering ship in which he flew had been designed with but\na single purpose:  to outrace tracking, come out of warp just long\nenough to aim the projectile, then split in two, the adjoining missile\n(hopefully) striking its target before the enemy could react, while the\nescape-ship ran for cover.\n\nIt was a desperate scheme, this squadron of forty missile-ships; but it\nremained theoretically possible, and therefore must be tried.  The\nCoalition powers had not been idle since the attack on Athena, and the\nhigh command of the Provinces of Democratic (East) Germany, suspecting\ntheir inner planets to be a likely next target, were determined to show\nHayes what they were made of---that it would be no easy fight---and\nthat the Dreadnought was not impregnable.\n\nConstant tension and near maniacal alertness had begun to take its toll\non the young pilot, chosen, along with the others, because of his\nlightning reflexes and exceptional endurance.  Two seconds of neglect\nwere all that was needed to end his life.  If for that brief period he\ndid not watch the signal monitor and react instantaneously to its\nwarning---the possible complexities of which were too vast even for an\nunassisted computer to judge---all was lost.  He could not know it,\nsince the speed at which he traveled made communication impossible, but\neight of his comrades had already been killed, or forced to break off\nbecause of mechanical failure.\n\nHe reached back to massage his aching neck.  Scarcely a moment had\npassed before he heard the warning tone---meteor particles directly\nahead.  With the thought control computer he veered left and down, then\nback again to the right.  His reactions had been swift and correct, and\nhe was able to readjust quickly and continue on toward the target.\n\nBut the beam was lost, so that now he flew blind.  And after a time the\nreal fear began to set in.  Roughly two hours later his craft spun out\nof control and exploded, after striking a meteor-pellet six inches\nlong.  SubCaptain Schmidt was lost a few minutes after that, when he\noutraced his beam and tried to decelerate too quickly.\n\nTwenty-four hours into the mission, only seven of the original forty\nremained, still at least eight hours away from their estimated time of\nintercept.\n\n\n\n\n\n IV\n\n\nHayes was wakened at 0400.  He felt upon first consciousness, as he\noften did after a short sleep, a vague and powerful sense of\nuneasiness, like a man walking steeply uphill, with death drawing\nnearer behind him.  He sat bolt upright, his jaw set and eyes squinting\nfire, and slowly the feeling passed.  He got out of bed, told the\nyeoman to send Calder to him at 0420, and stalked into the bathroom.\nFinishing his toilet he reentered the bedroom and immediately began his\nmorning isometrics, running through his mind as he did so the business\nof the day, and recalling with disciplined satisfaction his performance\nof the night before.  His words to the meeting of Staff:\n\n\"My fellow officers of the intrepid Third Fleet, your\nCommander-in-Chief asks much of you.  As President, he understands as I\ndo the urgent necessity of our great endeavor, and along with the\nSenate, stands squarely behind us.  But his political enemies, the\nweak-hearted opposition who hold the majority in Congress, needing to\nmake themselves feel important, have delayed a vote on the formal\nDeclaration of War.  They have attempted to sabotage the mechanisms of\njust vigilance and freedom.  They SAY they need more proof.\"  As he\nsaid this, and various officers scowled, he had looked over at Frank\nand nodded gravely, as if this was what had upset him in the\nPresident's reply.\n\n\"Fortunately, Edgar Stone is not the kind of man to let ignorance and\ncowardice stand in his way.  They have said they need more proof, of\nthe ruthless barbarity of the Coalition leaders against their own\npeople, as well as the armed strength of our great nation---and he has\nassigned US to give it to them.\"  Expressions of satisfaction and\napproval.  \"To us then falls the task of demonstrating the absolute\nsuperiority of the United Commonwealth of America, and the prowess of\nits men at arms.  He knows that in this, we shall not fail him.\"\n\nAs he recalled this speech Hayes felt only one regret.  In referring to\nStone's (supposed) vote of confidence in the Third Fleet, and\nsimultaneously expressing his own desires and expectations of it, he\nhad unwittingly imparted into their image of the President a courage\nand forthrightness he did not possess, and which might later have to be\naltered, should matters force a showdown and the need arise to\nchallenge his authority.\n\nBut this could not be helped, and already he felt his subconscious\nbeginning to turn the necessary phrases of shock and disbelief at\nStone's treachery and sudden reversal.  He dressed briskly, and had\nonly just begun to pace when Calder appeared at the portal.  He turned\nto him at once.\n\n\"Have communications officer Janson report to me in SubCon 20 in half\nan hour, then tell the yeoman to have my breakfast sent there.\"  His\nexpression changed slightly as he looked into the unquestioning face of\nhis loyal subaltern.  \"...  Do you want to know what he really said?\"\n\nCalder stepped beyond the portal and turned the small handle that\nsecurity-sealed the room, showing by this mute gesture that it did not\nmatter to him, he would serve his General as he had always done, but\nthat if Hayes wished to tell him he would be honored to listen.  He was\nthe one man who could have a softening effect on his master, though he\nwould have been shocked to learn it.  Hayes turned to face the wall.\n\n\"He tried to cut me off, Michael.\"  He glanced over at him briefly, the\nsmallest touch of melancholy, then back to the wall.  \"He said that my\n'obsession' with the communist threat was based on pure fabrication,\nthe result of an unbalance mind.\"  For as he spoke, he truly believed\nthat this was what Stone had done.  \"He said that to view the matter\nharshly, I had committed treason.....  He ordered me to return home\nwith my tail between my legs and maybe, MAYBE he  would forgive me.\"\nWithout turning he knew that Calder's face had assumed its\ncharacteristic frown of fierce devotion, the one that acknowledged\ntough measures were at hand, not wanted, but forced upon them by those\nenemies, unfathomable in their ignorance and baseness, who challenged\nand sought to sabotage his master's clear vision and irreproachable\naims.\n\n\"He can't do that, sir.\"  Hayes turned, rekindled, as always, by this\nsoldier's undying spirit.\n\n\"No, he can't.  Though it does my heart good to hear it.\"  Their eyes\nmet.  \"But you needed to know that things could get a little rough.\nThe President of the United Commonwealth himself is no longer above\nsuspicion.\"\n\n\"You know that I would do anything,\" stammered Calder.  \"Follow you\nanywhere.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!  That's the spirit we need to impart!  It's entirely on our\nshoulders now.  The Third Fleet must take up the sword alone.\"  His\ntemper had been quite restored.  \"But.\"  He raised a stern finger.\n\"One thing at a time, and not missing a single detail.  That's how\nwe've got to do it.\"\n\n\"The business of the day, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, we'll discuss it over breakfast.\"  A rare honor.  \"Have you eaten\nyet today?\"  And Calder went off to do his master's bidding.\n\nLeif Janson, meanwhile, dressed himself in a state of anxiety such as\nhe had seldom experienced.  He had no grounds for this feeling; he had\nbeen summoned at odd hours by high personages before.  But remembering\nhis blunder the day before, so innocent, and yet looked upon with such\ngravity, he felt in his gut that a dark cloud hung over him, and\nwondered only at the severity of the coming storm.\n\nHe had never liked Hayes, liked him still less for their meeting; but\nthis could not alter the fact, much as it galled him, that he was\nterrified of the man.  STUPID, he admonished himself.  THIS ISN'T NAZI\nGERMANY.  He tried to shave, cut himself, realized that this would look\nbad, placed a skin pad over the area, forgetting to wipe away the blood\nfirst, ripped it off, toweled his face and did it again.  By now his\nagitation was so acute that he began to get angry.  But his experience\nin government service told him that if he gave in to his instincts\n(fought back), not only would things not get better, they could get\nconsiderably worse.\n\nAnd so, passing through the corridor and up through an elevator tube,\nhe entered after two lefts and a right, the hallway that led to SubCon\n20.  He checked his watch.  Two minutes early.  He stopped, knowing by\nreputation Hayes' fanaticism concerning time.  Needing something to\noccupy his mind, he mused for perhaps the thousandth time that\neverything in the military was capital letters and even numbers:  black\nand white.  He paced a little, and looking up, saw to his dismay that\nthe hall camera followed his every movement.  He checked his watch.\nThirty seconds to go.  TO HELL WITH THIS, he thought.  He entered the\nchamber.\n\nHayes looked up from the table as he saluted, nodded placidly, and\nfinished his breakfast without haste.  Calder, standing against the\nadjacent wall, gazed at him with the blank, somewhat hostile expression\nof an off-duty drill sergeant.  Hayes placed the tray in the wall-slot,\nbrushed stray crumbs from the table with his uniform sleeve, and\nwithout rising, addressed him.\n\n\"Major Leif Janson, I believe.  Well, Major.  Since yesterday I've\nchecked your record, and I believe you can be trusted.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"  He wondered why this vote of confidence did not\ncomfort him.  \"I'm sorry for my blunder, sir.  It was inexcusable.\"\n\nHayes' words belied his expression.  \"A momentary lapse, nothing more.\"\n He placed a strange emphasis on 'lapse.'  \"You've been trained for\nhigh-speed craft, is that correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Janson said stiffly, maintaining with difficulty his rigid\nposture and straight-ahead gaze.  It had been twelve years, but this\nwas hardly the time.....\n\n\"I want you to run a very special errand for me, Major.  I want you to\ntake some particularly sensitive data back to President Stone, and\ndeliver it to him personally.  I'm having a Clipper specially prepared.\n She'll fly mainly on auto-pilot, with extra speed built in.  I need\nthis material in the President's hands by July 16---he'll know you're\ncoming.  Do you think you can do it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  Of course, sir.\"  But this was absurd.  Bullet-pouches were\nthree times faster, and with self-destruct, an infinitely better\nsecurity risk.\n\n\"Good, Major.  That's what I wanted to hear.  Report to Shuttle Dock 36\nat 1400 sharp.  You're to remain in your quarters till then, and speak\nof this to no one.  I'll have the flight-suit brought to you there.\nThe materials will be turned over to you by special courier aboard\nships.  Any questions?\"\n\nJanson glanced at him quickly.  There were no questions.\n\n\"That will be all then, Major.  Dismissed.\"  Janson saluted and showed\nhimself the door.  As his footsteps receded down the hallway, Hayes\nturned to Calder.\n\n\"You know what to do?\"  His second nodded sternly and went out.\n\nTOO BAD ABOUT THAT ONE, mused the Secretary briefly.  THEY SAY HE HAD A\nFAMILY.  Rising, he left the small conference room and moved with swift\nsteps toward the Main Intercommunications studio to prepare his\npre-battle address to the subcommanders.  NO, ON SECOND THOUGHT I'D\nBETTER MAKE IT THE ENTIRE CREW.  WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT LIKE THE THREE\nHUNDRED SPARTANS TOMORROW.  And pleased with this metaphor, trying to\nthink how to work it into his speech, he continued on his way.\n\n\n*\n\n\nSquadron-leader Dorfman was approaching his thirtieth hour in\nlight-warp, and was less than sixteen hours away from his projected\ntime of Intercept.  His was one of only five missile-ships that\nremained on course and on target.\n\nThere is a certain level of endurance beyond which even the strongest\nminds cannot go without some loss of rationality.  Dorfman, a seasoned\nveteran, had been on tough, grueling missions before, but this---he\ncould no longer deceive himself---was undoubtedly the cruelest.\n\nHe had been able to remain calmly alert and rest his eyes for brief\nintervals, trusting somewhat to fate, for the first eighteen hours or\nso, and this had bought him time.  A product of East German military\ntraining and thinking, his own life or death was now secondary to the\nsuccess or failure of the mission and, truly believing this, his fears\nhad not been able to engulf him.  His life had been full:  his wife was\na soldier's wife, and his son was now fourteen and able to look after\nher.  But it was not necessary for him, as it was for some men, to\ndiscount his own death through such a progression of thought.  He knew\nwhat his country was up against, and accepted his duty without\nreservation.\n\nBut even through so many well-laid defenses, the exhaustion and mental\nstrain had begun to do their work on him.  Fatigue became a constant\ntorture.  To keep his eyes open and on anything, let alone the bulbous,\nsoftly glowing scope before him, was next to impossible.  But to take a\nstimulant, he knew, would be worse.  He could ill afford to compound\nthe demands on mind and body.   Muscle tremors and adrenalin surges\nwould make him useless if ever. . .WHEN he reached his target.  Having\nno choice, he stayed where he was, his eyes fastened on the scope.\n\nBeing a thoroughly disciplined man, it was perhaps more difficult for\nhim to deal with the violent, primal images and emotions that now\nthrashed about inside him.  Visions of tearing Stone's throat out, and\nof sexual violence toward nameless, faceless women were particularly\nprevalent, but not nearly so painful as the occasional outbursts of\ngroundless hatred toward his wife and son.  He knew these for what they\nwere, distorted by-products of the subconscious, and reminded himself\nas their intensity grew that they could not physically hurt him.  But\nsecretly he was upset, and wished they would go away.\n\nFinally he had to make a decision.  It was either rest his eyes and\nneck for a moment, possibly get up and stretch, or smash his fist\nagainst the screen.  He stood up and put his hands together behind him,\ncraning both neck and back, them pumped his ribs twice with his biceps.\n He sat back down after an elapse of two minutes and drank some water.\nThen returned to his vigil.\n\n\n\n*                        *                        *\n\n\n\nIt was nearing 6:00 AM, United Commonwealth Earth time, 0600 by the\nmilitary clock.  On the dark side of Goethe there was no time, only the\nslow indifferent turning of the dark skied, sea-laden monster.\n\nHayes had decided to do the broadcast live.  He sat before the tiny\ncamera fixtures cool and alert, with a partial script before him.\nAdded to the natural intensity of his features was the hard, predatory\ngleam that always rimmed his eyes before a battle.  No matter that the\nrapid-black passage through the star gate, and the fighting sure to\nfollow, would not occur until the next morning.  He would not eat or\nsleep until then, concentrating all his energies and attention on the\nslightest details of preparation.  By seven o'clock the next morning he\nwould be transformed into the atavistic frame of mind where decisions\nwere not tainted by conscience or emotion but were ruthless, correct in\ntheir unhesitating aggression, and sharp as razor steel.  In battle as\nin life, he told himself, there was no substitute for hardness and\nsheer force of will.  The subtle throb and hum of the giant ship felt\nstrong and reassuring around him, as it headed toward the limits of the\nsystem.\n\nThe red light of the studio came on:  twenty seconds.  Ten.  The man in\nthe booth signaled him, and he began to speak.\n\n\"My fellow soldiers of the dauntless Third Fleet.  We stand on the eve\nof a great battle.  At stake is nothing less.....\"\n\nNine minutes later the first of the East German scat-ships came out of\nwarp.  In the five seconds allotted him, SubCaptain Hessler located the\ntarget, aimed and fired his missile, and broke off again into e-light.\nThe automated batteries aboard the Dreadnought picked up and analyzed\nhis presence, aimed a ruby laser and fired:  too late.  Also too late\nwere the bursts it fired at the lightning-fast projectile, sent in a\ncurved trajectory at its more vulnerable underside.\n\nThe neonuclear explosive hit home with a violence that even the\nemptiness of Space could not diffuse, penetrating seven of the\nCarrier's sixteen layered shields.\n\nWithin the ship there was a sudden, jarring concussion, and the\ncorridors of every vessel inside it resounded with the drone of a\nbattle-stations alert.  For the briefest instant the lights of the\nstudio went out; and when they returned Hayes saw that his speech was\nruined.  A pitcher of water had spilled across it, and the liquid\ninside blurred ink and paper together into an unrecognizable wrinkle of\nsmeared sheaves.  The man in the booth made a quizzical motion, in the\nform of a question drawing his finger across his throat.  But Hayes\nshook him off angrily.\n\n\"All men to your posts,\" he barked gruffly.  \"Maybe now you'll see that\nthis is no game.\"  He himself hastened to the uppermost bridge, furious\nat this sneak attack, and even more at his own men for having allowed\nit to happen.\n\n\"Damage report!\" he shouted, entering the circle of men and equipment\nthat scrambled with sudden activity like an ant-hill beaten with a\nstick.  \"How many ships!\"\n\n\"Damage report coming,\" said a voice, calm and professional.\n\n\"Just the one,\" came another.\n\n\"It only slowed to sub-light long enough to fire the projectile, then\nbroke off again just as fast.\"  This last belonged to Gen-Admiral\nFrank, commander of the Fleet.\n\n\"Why didn't the robot-guns get him?\"\n\n\"They weren't set for full kill intercept.  With so many Alliance ships\nin the vicinity, they had to analyze---\"\n\n\"I hope you've corrected THAT blunder.\"\n\n\"Yes, General.  And I've warned the Alliance pilots---\"\n\n\"Tell those French faggots to stay the hell away from us.\"  Hayes had\ntaken to calling the Belgians 'French', and the Swiss 'Krauts'.  \"If\nthey want to play soldier, let them do it somewhere else.\"\n\n\"Damage report,\" came the first voice.\n\n\"So what the hell are you waiting for?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir.  Outer seven shield-projectors damaged but reparable.\nSeveral of the discharging chutes and one of the lower batteries out\nfor twelve to twenty-four hours.  No significant damage to interior\nvessel or launch ships.\"\n\nAt this Hayes grew calmer, mastered his wrath.  NO SIGNIFICAN DAMAGE.\nThen perhaps it was for the best after all. . .so long as no more of\nthem got through.  And he liked the unruffled manner of the officer who\nhad given him the report.\n\n\"Very well, Captain.  Admiral Frank, have we got a fix on where he came\nfrom?\"  The Fleet Commander was immediately aware of the change in his\nsuperior's voice.\n\n\"Yes, General.  It came from the direction of East German Cerberus.\nWe've trained the First and Fourth Robot Artillery toward that vector,\nsince it's unlikely they've had time.....\"\n\n\"Correct, Admiral.  But see to it that the others aren't napping,\neither.\"  THE JERRIES ARE NO FOOLS, THOUGH.  THEY KNOW WE'RE COMING\nAFTER THEM.  \"Let's go up into the bubble for a moment, shall we?\nGentlemen, keep us posted.\"\n\nEntering the 'bubble' through the elevator, a small, Officers' Security\nChamber at the top of the uppermost bridge, the Secretary turned to\nFrank, and unexpectedly put his arm around his smaller compatriot's\nshoulder.  Though incapable of self-reproach, he knew he had been a bit\nhard on this man, whose loyalty he could ill afford to lose.\n\nConfused at this sudden gesture, Frank tried to clarify his position\nwith words.  \"I'm sorry, General.  Not going into full Intercept was a\nstupid oversight.  I'd just not had experience with this type of craft.\"\n\n\"No, Donald, that's all right.  It's a sign of desperation on their\npart, turning to guerilla warfare so soon.\"  He motioned the Admiral to\na chair, remained standing himself.  \"It may even be to our advantage\nin the long run.  Sometimes there's nothing better for a cocky fighter\nthan to take a solid right to the jaw---let's him know he's in a real\nfight.  Coffee?\"  Frank shook his head, and Hayes continued his oration.\n\n\"The upcoming battle isn't going to be as easy as the last one, though\nthis time we'll be more experienced.  Obviously word has leaked out\nthat we plan to go after the D.G. Provinces.  They can't know where we\nplan to hit them, of course (the last three digits of the attack\ncoordinates were only now being relayed to the engineers at the Gate),\nbut we could still run across the greater part of the Coalition forces\nbefore we're through.  And who knows?  It might not end there.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"  Frank's look was puzzled.\n\n\"I mean that Congress and the liberal press are giving Stone a tougher\ntime on this than I first let on.  He's got the authority and resources\nto supply the Third Fleet, but when the House will come around with\nfull appropriations is another question.\"\n\n\"But surely after this attack the Soviets will intervene?  Why. . .we\ncan't take on Soviet Space with just the Third Fleet.\"  For a moment\nHayes stopped his pacing, and unconsciously ground his teeth.  He did\nthis with his back to the admiral, but realized that it might still\nlook odd.  He continued.\n\n\"All the same, I want to hold back as many of our ships as possible,\nkeep losses to a minimum.  And that means the launch-pilots, and our\nown gunners, are going to have to fight like hell.\"\n\nFrank was silent.  Hayes took a deep breath and half sighed.  \"Well,\nmaybe we'll get reinforcements sooner.  One battle at a time!  For now\nwe've got the best men, the best equipment, AND the best leadership.\"\nHe winked with his eyelid only.  \"Well.  Let's go back and see if the\nGermans have any more surprises for us.\"\n\nThe man rose, shook the hand Hayes offered, and both returned to the\nbridge.\n\n\"Got him, sir!\" came a young voice, almost playful.  \"Knocked him out\nbefore he could fire; beat the damn computer, too.\"  The man, facing\nthe controls of Auxiliary Laser Deployment, had obviously not seen the\ntwo generals re-enter.\n\n\"And just exactly what have you GOT?\" said Frank disparagingly.  The\nsoldier whirled in his chair, and for a moment his face registered\nalarm.  But very quickly the look of boyish confidence returned.\n\n\"One of those German torpedo-ships, Admiral.  Neutralized the missile,\ntoo.\"\n\n\"Correct sir,\" added the main gunnery officer.  Frank started to say\nsomething, but Hayes lightly touched his arm.\n\n\"That's very good shooting, gunner.  But what would have happened if\nanother 'torpedo ship' came out of warp while you were celebrating?  I\nassure you, you'll have no time for games tomorrow.  And to be sure\nthat I make my point, I'm going to assign you a quota.  Knock out\ntwelve more targets tomorrow, and you might even retain your present\nrank.  Do I make myself quite clear?\"\n\nThe young man looked confused, turned to the gunnery officer as for\nsupport.  But aware of Frank's eyes upon him, this older man nodded\nsternly, and the gunner had no choice.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Secretary.\"  Angry, humiliated, he turned back to his\nstation.  I'LL GET MORE THAN TWELVE, YOU OVERSTUFFED SON OF A BITCH.\nSuch were his thoughts all that morning, and the thoughts that carried\nover, and were turned to hatred in the midst of the next day's fighting.\n\nReturning after a time to the Intercom Studio, Hayes addressed the\nassembly again, this time in different tone and with stronger words.\nAnd like pondering horses to the whip, they responded.\n\nBut not all of them alike.\n\n\n*\n\n\nSquadron-leader Heinrich Dorfman, in the last of three German ships to\ncomplete the mission, had held himself back on purpose, hoping to\narrive last and unexpectedly---to do real, rather than symbolic damage.\n And when his lead signal bounced back to him the image of Goethe,\nstill some distance away, along with the outward-bound trail of the\nsupercarrier, he set his course.  He did this carefully, staying just\nabove tracking speed, in a wide arc, hoping to come upon the\nDreadnought in a time and place not as thoroughly guarded.\n\nAnd like the two younger pilots who had come so far, his mind had long\nsince crossed the line of rational human endurance.  Now, when he\nclosed his eyes he saw the gray, rotted-meat faces of old men crawling\nwith maggots.  He saw random sexual parts horribly distorted:  almost\nphysical the effect of their ugliness upon him.  His spirit had given\nup all hope of survival:  strange voices.  His tortured neck and back\nfused with the paroxysms of a migraine to form the single and\ninescapable sensation of concrete and iron, bent-forward pain.  He felt\nhe no longer had eyes, but that the image of the scope shot straight\nthrough the empty skull-sockets and into his brain.  The last remnants\nof heart and courage despaired.\n\nBut now, on the verge of his thirtieth hour, with the target in reach,\nit was almost as though his mind were no longer attached to the body.\nNumb fatigue had shaken it off like the parting soul shakes off flesh.\nNothing remained but his mission and his will.\n\nHe was ready.  He would do it.  He tried to rouse himself mentally for\nthe last decisive seconds.  He bean to slow out of  light speed.\n\nThe time was now.  Not too fast.....\n\n\n\n        :00-  The ship in sight, minor adjustment.\n        :01-  Locked on.\n        :02-  Fire.  WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG?\n        :03-  Indicator light.  PROJECTILE NON-FUNCTIONAL\n        :04-  DAMN IT!  Manual disengage, back to---\n        :05-  Warp.  Robot batteries aboard Dreadnought destroy the\ncast-off projectile.  Fan-burst of ruby lasers miss the second target,\nfire again.\n\n\n        :57-  Dorfman breaks his hand against the ceiling of the inner\nhull.  He had failed.  \"Damn it!  GOD DAMN IT!\"  \n\n\n        21:12-  The squadron leader slows his tiny ship and continues\nto steer toward the sun, Athena.  Slowing further still, he places\nhimself directly in line with sun and planet, close enough to Athena to\ndistort tracking.  Sends out his sounding beam.\n\n\n\n        34:29-  Dorfman continues to wait for his signal to proceed him\nto Goethe.  The time arrives.  With the last of his e-light capacity\nand deep-space fuel, he fires toward the distant speck of blue-green\nocean world.\n\n\n        49:50-  The third echo of his signal tells him he is drawing\nnear.  Slows to sub-light and raises entry shields, makes other\npreparations to enter atmosphere.\n\n\n        1:13:30-  Entry halfway competed:  elevation 1200 Kilometers.\nThe buffeting of atmosphere increases.  Aware that he is being tracked\nand pursued by Alliance fighters, he makes jerking motions with the\nvessel, simulating (and nearly causing) atmospheric destruction.\n\n\n        1:31:37-  Alliance fighters draw within firing range.  Dorfman\nmimics a lifeless crash-landing into the dark, heaving waters.  The\npursuit ships hover for a time.  Sixty foot waves show only scattered\ndebris, no signs of life.  They break off.\n\n\n\n        1:55:24-  Czech submarin-guerilla vessel picks up coded\nrecovery signal, makes toward the jettisoned escape pod, small and\ncoffin-shaped.\n\n\n        3:27:02-  Submarin vessel recovers German pilot, returns to a\nsafer depth and slinks carefully back to guerilla base.\n\n\n        5:56:00-  A large underwater door, thoroughly camouflaged,\nopens in the root of tower-like Manta Island.  Vessel enters, continues\nforward, then slowly rises to the surface of a vast, underground\nhollow.  Heinrich Dorfman begins his exile, which will last until the\nend of the war.\n\n\n\n*                        *                        *\n\n\nAt 1440 hours, a bay door was opened aboard the Dreadnought, and a\nsmall speed-shuttle emerged.  Major Janson brought her to a safe\ndistance from the mother ship, double-checked coordinates, and took a\ndeep breath.  Slowly he engaged the main engines, preparing for\nlight-speed.\n\n\"God help us.....  At least I'll get to see Jenny and the kids.\"\n\nHe achieved the necessary momentum, switched on to full power, and\nturned the controls over to the computer.  Seven minutes later the bomb\ndetonated, and the ship burst into a thousand fragments.\n\nHis Christian God did nothing to save him.\n\n\n......................................................................\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nAt 0700 the following day the Dreadnought approached the Star Gate,\nwhose hexagonal frame gleamed coldly among the stars like the\nblue-black barrel of a gun, surrounded by the vessels of its makers.\n\nLinear skeletons, huge anti-matter projectors lay dormant within, their\ntask completed.  A soft-glistening sheet of silver, like a fine spray\nof undulating mist, shrouded the multiplied blackness beyond.  This\nprotective film began to grow vague as the rounded monolith of the\nCarrier, here and there ribbed or jagged, continued to advance\npatiently, with measured speed.\n\nThis silent Gate to Cerberus, newest tool of Armageddon, like those\nbefore it showed not the slightest emotion at its use, only cold,\nmechanical efficiency.  The curving prow of Dreadnought, insane\nmetallic smile, pushed forward at the mark, and was wrapped in a clear\nsheen of brilliance.\n\nTo a suddenly humbled engineering vessel that viewed this passage from\nthe side (though itself a work of successive human genius), it appeared\nindeed a magician's trick:  the monstrous vessel was reduced by small\nfractions.  Length was seduced, and did not reappear.  And then the\nthrusting phallus was gone.  The framework was all that remained.\n\nAboard the carrier the rush of scintillating motion had begun.  Even\nthose crews aboard ships within the great ship, their minds bent\nforward in preparation for combat, could feel the sudden thrill of\nweightless, bodiless movement, and taste the ghoulish hum that began at\nlow, convulsive pitch, then rose through noteless octaves, whirling,\nthen whining high and unbearable, then gone beyond the range of hearing.\n\nAboard the vessel only Hayes seemed unmoved by the lightless passage,\nlike falling down a colossal well to the heart of a venomous, robotoid\nplanet.  All ship's power was lost, and in that phantom black those who\ndid not already grip at chair and support-beam bent to their knees as\nif in prayer for deliverance.\n\nBut not Hayes.  In his mind, he descended into Hell like the crucified\nChrist, whose lanced breast had flowed blood and water of forgiveness.\nExcept that Hayes did not forgive.  For soon he would rise again,\ninvincible.\n\nTrue to the hollow-world metaphor, the ship, upon reaching the center\nof its plunge, passed through and slowed gradually, and sensation\nbecame more bearable.  The witch-sound returned with its screeching\nwhine; but soon the worst was passed.  And like the short-lived fright\nof the daring child, who has pumped and pulled the playground swing to\nits highest arc and is suddenly weightless, cast loose from the normal\nlaws of earth, feels a moment's fear, but then with the rush of\ndownward motion again feels himself a conqueror, who has faced the\ndarkness unafraid, so the men of the Third Fleet, once more surviving\nthe nightmare world, felt themselves strong and hard, little boys\nafraid of nothing, marching boldly toward their moment of destiny and\nschoolyard fight.\n\nAnd all at once their power returned.  On the re-lighted bridge men\nquickly assumed martial attitudes, and those whose functions allowed it\nwatched the screens.  Another silvery sheet appeared before them.\n\nSoon this, too, was parted.  Stars returned to the sky, along with the\ngold-orangish hue of a nearby planet.  And behind and to one side of\nthem, though still far off, a detachment of the Coalition Fleet whirled\nabout and began to pursue.  From the orbit of the planet as well, rose\na small and desperate defense.\n\nHayes' voice boomed on the intercom, superceding sectarian commanders.\n\"All vessels prepare to attack.  Chutes one through twelve lower and\ndischarge.  Enemy at five o'clock, bearing 3 - 4 Mark.  Outward\nbatteries key on planetary forces.  Give 'em hell boys; this one's for\nreal!\"\n\nWithin minutes over two hundred fighters, cruisers and destroyers had\nemerged from the death-womb of the Carrier, formed into squadrons and\nflotillas, turned to face the enemy and begun to move forward.  That\nnumber again, including the four titanic battleships, were held in\nreserve.\n\nThe straggle of fighters and destroyers from the planet's last line of\ndefense the launched ships ignored altogether, these being handled\neasily by the multitude of blazing turrets aboard the Dreadnought.  One\nor two handfuls managed to elude fire long enough to harry the rear of\nthe advancing ranks; but these were little more than beetles biting at\nthe legs of wolves.  A single heavy cruiser would turn its guns in\ntheir direction, and end forever the one-sided argument.\n\nThe ships that advanced to meet them were more formidable.  Suspecting\na move of this kind (but needing to suspect a dozen other possibilities\nas well), the Coalition had detached eighty vessels, nearly a quarter\nof its strength, to patrol the area, and defend Friedrich Schiller, the\nbeloved and irreplaceable East German home planet.  And when the time\ncame, though sleep had been scarce and tension high, they were ready to\nfight.  Consisting mainly of German forces, they needed no\nhigh-sounding words to give blood in defense of their homeland.\n\nIn open Space battles of this kind, where there was no constricting\nlattice of energy fields to hinder movement (as at the Battle of\nAthena), the aggressor held the decided advantage.  For here there was\nno barricades or tactically advantageous points, only a three\ndimensional sea of emptiness in all directions, here and there pricked\nby planet islands, themselves destructible and a hindrance to mobility.\n For this reason both sides had attempted to charge, and the resulting\ncollision of forces at once split the conflagration into a dissipated\nstruggle without borders, boundaries or points of reference.\n\nAnd for the Coalition pilots and vessel commanders, this proved to be\nfatal.  Outnumbered nearly three to one by more modern, swifter craft,\nneeding to be watchful of every quarter at once, aware that soon the\nDreadnought would add its considerable firepower to the fray, and thus\nneeding an early knockout. . .it was impossible.  They fought with\ncourage and intensity, but so did the Americans.  And though they knew\nit was no game (some of the Americans did also), and though they fought\nfor home and family, this could not make them react quicker or shoot\nstraighter than their more youthful counterparts, whose duel\nambition---to stay alive and cover themselves with glory---combined\nwith simply better equipment to give them the clear and early upper\nhand.\n\nThere would be no repeat of the Battle of Britain.\n\nAfter ninety minutes of butchery, the bravest socialist pilots had had\nenough.  Those who could, turned and fled into warp.  Those who could\nnot, were cut to pieces by the Dreadnought.\n\nThere were no prisoners taken.\n\n\n*\n\n\nWhile at the conclusion of this skirmish some faces among the ranks of\nthe Commonwealth force beamed with confidence and victory, Hayes' was\nnot one of them.  He allowed his men roughly three minutes to exchange\nwar hoops and congratulations, then ordered  his next deployment.  And\nhe ordered his new Communications Officer, stationed on the bridge, to\nmake contact with Schiller, which now lay exposed.\n\nAt first the planet refused to acknowledge the attempt, feigning\ninterference.  It was obvious they were trying to buy time.  But when\nthe Dreadnought, which continued to advance, began to lower its four\ngreat battleships, and Hayes, on an uncoded channel ordered them, once\ndeployed, to take up pseudo-orbital positions around it and begin\nplanetary destruct sequence, the East German leadership dropped its\nfutile ploy. On the large central screen of the bridge, the erect\nfigure of the Prime Minister appeared, seated at the head of a long\ntable surrounded by military advisors.  His face was gray and stern.\nThough his English was good, he chose for the moment to make it harsh\nand clipped.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Secretary.\"\n\n\"Good morning, Schultz.  I won't banter.  I want your planetary shields\nlowered, and your orbiting Artillery Stations---yes, I know about\nthem---silenced and evacuated.  They will be destroyed in one hour's\ntime.  Also, I want you to relay my signal to General Itjes.\"\n\n\"First let me be sure I understand you.  Are you offering terms for our\nsurrender?\"\n\n\"I'm doing nothing of the kind and you know it.  Your planet and your\npeople are, for the moment, my hostage.  I will reestablish contact in\none hour and ten minutes.  At that time I will expect a patch-through\nto Itjes.  In the meantime my ships will continue to take up positions\naround you.  If they are fired upon, even once, I'll turn the\nbattleships loose on the cities.\"  He signaled his Com Officer to end\nthe transmission.\n\nThe Third Fleet, three quarters of which was now discharged from the\ncarrier, began to form up into fully operational task forces, each with\na battleship in its center, and to move into place in a wide belt\nencircling the planet, then turned facing outward like a bristle of\nspears.  Or more aptly, since the guns of the battleships faced inward\nas well, like a crown of thorns.\n\nHayes' plan was cruelly simple:  to put a gun to the head of Schiller,\nand force General Itjes and the remainder of the Coalition fleet into a\nfight they couldn't win.  His deepest concern was for the passage of\ntime, which might bring enemies and forces unlooked-for.  By recent\nintelligence the nearest significant Soviet presence was at least a\nweek distant.  But how many of the smaller nations of the Coalition\nmight be willing to risk their own national forces, it was impossible\nto say.  But here Hayes held to the confidence of the bully, believing\nthat each would be more concerned with their own personal survival, and\nthus bring them all into peril.\n\nThe allotted time passed.  The task forces stood at the ready.  Itjes\ncontinued to move swiftly toward the system, and the entire planet\nscrambled into plans of evacuation that few had believed would ever be\nused.\n\nAnd when they received news of the plight of fully half their\nspace-bound population, and of their dearest home save earth, the East\nGerman forces of other Coalition patrols, near and  far, with leave or\nwithout it, broke off and began to converge on Schiller.  Were it not\nfor the time factor ---the majority of these would not arrive (or even\nreceive the message) for days---Hayes might have had a problem.\n\nAnd even in the coming duel with Itjes' divided force, the scales might\nhave been more evenly balanced, but for the simple disparity in the\nweapons-systems of a wealthy superpower, and those of a group of\nnations which had to live, buy, and protect within their means.  The\nfour Commonwealth battleships were of a class possessed by only three\nPowers in the galaxy---themselves, the Soviet Space Republics (which\ndidn't deal them out), and the German States, who had no apparent love\nfor their sundered countrymen.  Also added to the equation:\n\nThe two remaining Coalition carriers, ten years old and of a lesser\nSoviet series, could fit together inside the Dreadnought, and had not\none-third the long-range firepower.  Neither was capable of extended\nwarp; and needless to say, they had no star gate, and thus no surprise\ncapability.  They were built for defense, and the Coalition defenses\nhad been breached.  How Hayes (or anyone else) could take pleasure in\nthe prospect of a battle at such clearly unequal odds, remained a\nmystery.\n\nHe was connected to Helmut Itjes.\n\n\"Yes, General Hayes.  You have our people by the throat; what do you\nwant?\"  Itjes had lived too long.....\n\nAt this point Hayes blanked out his own visual transmission.  He then\nwrote out his replies on paper, to be read by the Communications\nOfficer.  He was going to leave the enemy no proof of the conversation\nabout to follow.  A short pause, then the young man read:\n\n\"I want you, General Itjes.  If the First Combat Fleet will engage us,\nto the death, the civilians may go free---afterwards.\"\n\n\"And if we refuse?\"\n\n\"I will blanket the planet with microwaves.  It would be a shame to\ndestroy. . .such beautiful architecture.\"\n\n\"What kind of animal are you?\" snapped Itjes.  He now saw, beyond all\ndoubt, that he was dealing with a madman.  The written notes, read by a\nyoung voice without malice or understanding, had sent a chill straight\nthrough him.  They reminded him strangely, uncannily, of the techniques\nemployed by Adolph Eichmann and the Hitler S.S.\n\n...   \"The one who's going to see you in Hell.\"\n\n\"I will attack when the Dresden detachment joins us.  Then God HELP\nyou.\"\n\n\"You have twelve hours, Helmut.\"\n\n\"My name is ITJES!\"\n\nThe screen went blank.\n\n\n\n*                        *                        *\n\n\n\nThe Coalition First Combat Fleet, both detachments, stood fast at a\nsafe distance from the hornet's nest that surrounded Schiller, and\nformed into a single front to face them.\n\nItjes stood among his officers and technicians on the bridge of the\ncarrier 'Smolensk', staring at the blank communications screen.  Five\nminutes before he had told Hayes flatly that there would be no\nengagement without his recordable promise---both visual and vocal---of\nthe free evacuation of the planet, regardless of the outcome of the\nbattle.  This helpless waiting, for a reply so paramount, and yet so\nutterly beyond his control, was an agony of the human spirit.\n\nThe request was perfectly reasonable, and Hayes had every intention of\ngranting it.  He merely wanted the extra time to study his opponent's\nweaponry and deployment.  There was something to be learned even from\nthe loser of a given confrontation, and Itjes had the reputation of\nbeing a tough and resourceful foe.  So he watched, and made mental\nnotes:  two-hundred and sixty lesser craft against his three-hundred\ndeployed, and the superior guns of the Dreadnought.  This should teach\nhis boys to fight.\n\nThe Commonwealth forces began to move forward.  Hayes appeared on the\nscreen, flanked by Admiral Frank.  \"You have your promise, General.\nWin or lose, utterly, and the population goes free.\"\n\nUtterly.\n\nItjes bit his lip till it bled, ordered his forces to attack.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe main battle went much the same as the skirmish which had preceded\nit.  The Coalition's flyers were, on the whole more experienced, more\ndisciplined, in some ways better trained; and for a time they did\nfairly well.  They kept their forces together, found cracks in the\nfences of their enemies, and were able to weed out and destroy the\ngreener of the American combatants.\n\nBut soon the blows were raining hard and heavy upon them, and coming\nfrom every direction at once.  Squadrons and formations were broken up,\nstrategies broken down.  And after a time, good and lesser soldiers\nalike, veterans and younger men, husbands, heroes and cowards, were\nkilled by shots that did not discriminate.  No magical God-force\nprotected the just and perseverant; no hand of Providence reached down.\n Men and women died, adding their silent numbers to the ancient mass of\ncorpses piled in an endless grave in the name of War, because men had\nnot yet learned that name was foul.\n\nThe Coalition forces kept fighting for five hours, fighting and dying,\nwaiting for an order to retreat that never came, fighting and dying and\nwaiting for an order to retreat that never came, then a surrender that\nnever came, fighting and dying and waiting for an order to retreat and\nthen a surrender, and an end to the carnage that never came, fighting\nand dying and waiting for an order to retreat and then a surrender and\nan end to the carnage, and some kind of sanity that never came,\nfighting and dying and waiting for an order to retreat and then a\nsurrender and some kind of sanity, then simple deliverance, that never\ncame---except in death.\n\nThe Commonwealth lost eighty ships, mostly fighters and destroyers, in\nannihilating the entire Coalition Fleet.  Ten hours later the last\nevacuation vessels left the planet, though many inhabitants remained\nbehind of their own volition.  The four Battleships took up their\nequidistant points about the equator of the Friedrich Schiller, firing\na long and continuous heat and shock laser burst into its core.  The\nplanet's surface writhed and convulsed with earthquakes and eruptions\nfor perhaps two hours, till the outer crust was broken into crumbling\nislands in a molten sea, and what was left of the face fell apart.  The\nBattleships ceased their barrage, leaving it to die its final death of\nfire, lava and smoke.  The Secretary chose to leave it thus, rather\nthan blow it apart, to further anger the Soviets and goad them into\nreprisals.  That such a decision might have other consequences he knew,\nbut at that moment his mind was driven by a single impulse only.  He\nwanted, with all his soul, a full-scale World War.\n\nSeveral hours later in prearranged rendezvous, the Third Fleet's\nengineering vessels followed the earlier course of the Dreadnought\nthrough the star gate.  Immediately upon arrival (and finding that\nthings had gone their way), they turned about and began to construct a\nsecond entrance, leading back the way they had come.  Since the\ncorridor itself was already in existence, needing only a return inlet,\nthis took less than forty-eight hours.  Then, all Commonwealth vessels\ntucked up safe inside the mother, the Third Fleet returned to the\nlimits of the Athena system, destroying the further gate, dismantling\nthe nearer, behind them.  The Dreadnought then proceeded, at just above\ntracking speed, to a new and untraceable location.\n\nHayes had won again.\n\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n        News of the Battle of Schiller did not reach Earth (those\nportions controlled by the United Commonwealth) until July 3, one week\nafter the fact, and one day before the annual celebration of the\nnation's Independence.  The President received from Hayes at that time\na three line, uncoded message:\n\nTHE COALITION FIRST COMBAT FLEET IS NEUTRALIZED AND THE PLANET SCHILLER\nDESTROYED.  THE PUPPET GOVERMENTS OF THE POST-EUROPEAN COMMUNIST PACT\nARE COWED AND IN DISARRAY.  WE HAVE DEALT ANOTHER SERIOUS BLOW TO\nSOVIET HOPES OF EXPANSIONISM.\n\nIn the same pouch came Admiral Frank's report to the Joint Chiefs of\nStaff, giving a detailed account of the battle, and of the performance\nof the Third Fleet.  For the first time a list of casualties was\nincluded.\n\nThe third item contained within the high-speed bullet-pouch, was a\ncarefully edited audio-visual program intended for consumption by the\npublic and the press.  This two-hour propaganda masterpiece consisted\nof selected scenes from the confrontation, a supposed eyewitness\naccount of East German atrocities, and a visual 'letter' from a young\nTexas pilot to his wife and baby son.  Sitting on his bunk aboard the\nDreadnought, his handsome face, drawling voice and simple,\nstraightforward manner were an enchantment of rugged innocence and male\nAmerican charm.\n\n\n*\n\n\n\"Donna, Jimmy.  I just wanted to tell you that I love you and I miss\nyou, and I think of you every day.  I also wanted you to know that I\nbelieve in what we're fighting for way out here, and that someday I\nhope to make you as proud of me, as I am proud to be a part of this\ngreat cause.\n\n\"Because ya know, truth and freedom may sound like just words, to some\nfolks who don't appreciate what they have, or don't feel the emptiness\nand suffering of those forced to live without them.  But being out\nhere, and seeing what I've seen, you come to realize that not\neveryone's as lucky as we are in America.  You learn that there are\ngovernments who so fear God's truth, that they'll subject their own\nbrothers to a police-state existence, just to insure that the Christian\nmessage of freedom and hope is never heard.\n\n\"Now I'm not pretending to know everything there is to know about life\nor politics, and it's a terrible tragedy to have to go to war just to\ngive back to people rights and dignities that never should have been\ntaken away from them.  And I won't lie to you, Donna.  Despite the\nadvantages God's given us, in weaponry and leadership, I may be hurt,\nor even killed, before the fighting is over.\n\n\"But if that's so then I'll die proud, knowing that I served my country\nas well as any man could, whether some faint-hearted politicians in\nWashington stood behind me or not.  And Jimmy, if something should\nhappen and you have to grow up without a papa, I can only hope that\nsomeday, God willing, you'll have the same chance that I do now, to fly\nand fight for the greatest nation in the galaxy, the United\nCommonwealth of America.\n\n\"Well, I guess that's all for now.  Give my love to Mama, and God\nbless.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bullet-pouch was not, however, the first word that Stone had heard\nof the massacre.  The day before he had received a tele-communication\nfrom Soviet Premier Denisov, short and to the point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mr. President.  Is it war you want?\"\n\nAt this point Stone motioned in his Vice-President, Jordan Plant, who\nwas standing by the door.  The visual screens of both powers remained\nblank.\n\n\"No, Premier Denisov.  That's the last thing I want.\"\n\n\"Then why does your Secretary of State continue to murder in your name?\n I am sure you have heard what happened in East German Cerberus?\"\n\nStone turned a helpless look toward Plant, who first lifted his hands\n(he didn't know), then moved closer and whispered in his ear:\n\"Whatever Hayes has done, now more than ever we have to tell him.\"\n\nStone took a deep breath.\n\n\"Secretary Hayes is no longer acting under my orders.  And I did not\norder the attack on Athena.\"\n\nThere was no pause on the part of Denisov.  \"Now you must tell me\nsomething I do not already know.  But I ask you plainly, Mr. Stone.\nWhat do you plan to do about it?\"\n\nPlant quickly wrote a reply on his note-board and handed it to the\npresident, who read it with all the gravity he could muster.\n\n\"I have not yet given up hope that General Hayes can be peacefully\ndissuaded from his present course.  But be assured, one way or the\nother, he will be brought to justice.\"\n\n\"And let me assure YOU, Mr. President, that our patience is at an end.\nYou have thirteen days to return me a better answer, or the Soviet\nSpace Republics will deal with the Third Fleet ourselves.\"\n\nStone paused, but the words were his own.  \"You know I can't let you do\nthat.\"\n\nWhether these last words were heard or not, there was no reply.  The\nchannel was closed.  Luther Bacon, White House Chief-of-Staff, was then\nbrought in and apprised of the situation.\n\nThe next day, after receiving Hayes' bullet and trying (unsuccessfully)\nto keep its contents from the press, the three held their council.\nBacon paced thoughtfully.  Plant, seated, touched his fingertips\nlightly together while Stone, disconsolate, felt the walls crumbling\naround him.  Half an hour before, despite all their efforts, he had\nreceived a phone call from a member of the New York Press Corps\nfriendly to the administration, informing him that a duplicate pouch\nhad been received by its members, and that the news was spreading like\nwildfire.\n\nFinally the President exploded.  \"What are we going to DO?  We have\nless than two weeks to answer the Russians, and it will take nearly\nthat long to send and receive one more message from Hayes.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" said Plant, the unspoken leader of the three.  \"Luther,\nif you'll come with me to my office, we'll begin work on our reply to\nGeneral Hayes.  I'm afraid it's time to take strong measures against\nhim.\"\n\n\"That son of a bitch!\" fumed Stone, hurling a vase at the wall.  \"That\nson of a BITCH.\"\n\n\"That won't help this time,\" said Bacon.  \"Believe me.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Plant seriously.  \"I suggest we get to work.  Try to\ncalm yourself, Edgar.  We'll meet here again in an hour's time.\"\n\nWhen the two men returned to the Oval Office with the drafted document,\nthey found Stone in an attitude of despair.  He listened blankly as\nBacon read the finished product, signed it where and when he was asked.\n\n\"Just words,\" he said listlessly.  \"Like all the words I've been\nspouting for twenty years, they don't mean a thing.  Hayes does his\ntalking with a gun, and soon Denisov will do the same.  What now,\nJordan?  What of the Joint Chiefs---will they betray us, too?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Plant levelly.  \"But as to your first question,\nI'd say we have to send our communication to the Secretary, then\nprepare a full statement to the press.  We've got to get this thing out\nin the open.  We've got to tell the truth, then let the people decide.\"\n\n\"Of course you're right.\"  Stone paused, then said simply.  \"Should I\nresign, Jordan?  You're much more qualified to handle this---\"\n\nPlant stood up and waved his hands in desperate denial.  For though his\nlife's whole ambition could there be suddenly realized, he saw in the\nsharp clarity of his mind, heightened and given truer perspective by\nthe crisis which hung thick all around them, that it would be wrong,\nand possibly disastrous, to assume the Presidency now.  And though much\nthat was good in him lay fallen by the way, discarded and forgotten\namong the endless compromises needed to keep him on the road to his one\ndesire, he too had a line he would not cross.\n\nTOO MANY FAIRY TALES AS A CHILD, he told himself.  But once made, his\ndecision was final.  He could not sell all that he was, for any price.\n\n\"No, Edgar.  Don't resign.  The last thing we need now is added\ninstability.  We may find ourselves in the midst of a Constitutional\ncrisis soon.....  Don't you see?\"  He felt a strange passion rising\ninside him.  \"It's not just you or I that are under attack, but the\nwhole system.  The work of Jefferson and Adams, and so many others, is\nreceiving probably the toughest challenge it's ever faced.  But it's\nnever cracked before, and believe me, there've been plenty of chances.\nYou,\" he said slowly, emphatically, \"are the duly elected President of\nthe United Commonwealth.  Hayes is no more than a crazed demagogue with\na gun.  We've got to hold on to that.  We've got to hold on.....\"\n\nAnd then suddenly, incredulously, he laughed.  And in that momentary\nfreeing of the heart, so long caged and disciplined toward a single\nend, he felt a childish joy, and release so pure that warm tears\nstarted at his eyes.  Stone looked at him, bewildered.\n\n\"Don't you see it, Edgar?  Don't you really?  The only difference\nbetween us is that you never let yourself play the hero in schoolyard\ngames, thinking you weren't good enough, or just being bitter about\nyour father, or some other damned thing.  You're no worse than I am,\nbelieve me.\"  Slowly he mastered his mirth, though the feeling of\ndefiant freedom lingered.  \"We're neither one of us heroes, my friend;\nbut it seems we're all we've got.  You need more illusions,\nEdgar---they keep you longer from the void.  Try on the mask of virtue\nnext.  It may save our asses yet.\"\n\n\"But what about the Soviets?  What can we possibly do in thirteen days?\"\n\n\"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.\"\n\n\"Or find it washed out.\"\n\n\"Maybe.  But for now we've got to deal with Hayes.  'Sufficient unto\nthe day is the evil thereof.'\"\n\nStone thought for a moment.  \"Who said that, Jordan?\"\n\n\"Jesus Christ.\"\n\n\"I didn't know you were a believer.\"\n\n\"I'm not.\"\n\nThe three summoned in Press Secretary Miller, who could no longer be\nfed bits and pieces of the truth.  Robert Weiss, Stone's other top\nadviser (and firmly in General Hayes' camp) continued to demand to see\nthe President.  Bacon continued to deny the request.\n\nThe message was sent to Hayes, who now made no secret of his\nwhereabouts:  ten days from the limits of Soviet Space.  Unreachable by\nstealth, yet tantalizingly close.\n\nThe pieces continued to move across the board.  The middle-game, which\nwasn't a game at all, had begun.\n\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nThe trouble and damage caused by the rift within the Commonwealth, and\nthe subsequent break in relations with Moscow, were in no way limited\nto the lesser and intermediate socialist powers that came under Soviet\ninfluence, nor did they wholly end with the eventual cessations of\nthose hostilities.\n\nThe growing instability of a dozen far-reaching theatres, had first\ncautiously, and then more freely, burst into expansionist violence.  It\nwas almost as if the perpetrators of these lesser conflicts had\nsimultaneously realized that Law along the frontiers was diminished,\nand waited only long enough to be sure they were not caught alone in\nthe looting and thievery.  And a riot, once begun, is very difficult to\nbring under control.\n\nChoose a metaphor.  The Marshall of an Old West mining community gunned\ndown, and the town taken over by outlaws.  The blackout of a large\nmetropolis, with bands of looters roaming the streets.  The sudden\ncollapse of an Empire, or the death of an heirless king.  By any name\nthe resulting darkness, the anarchy of violence, remained the same.\nWith this exception only.  The Law was not wholly diminished, as two of\nthe four Superpowers remained largely unaffected.  And the chief\npirateers were now nations, and there were, therefore, (supposedly)\nhigher motives, and diplomatic niceties involved.\n\nBecause respectable governments, if they want to stay in power, don't\ncall themselves outlaws; and to their collective mind the words\n'occupation' and 'theft', 'war' and 'murder', are not interchangeable.\nThough the difference might have been hard to explain to those on the\nwrong side of the gun.\n\nThat the Belgians and Swiss struck again, and first, was perhaps not\nsurprising.  That the Arabs and Israelis had yet one more go at each\nother, perhaps little more so.  That the German States continued to\nsell arms to nearly anyone with the money to buy---they had taken that\njob over from the Americans and Soviets---was, after all, only to be\nexpected.  And if the Dutch lost nearly all they had in the outlying\nsectors, bitter and friendless but for help from Sweden which arrived\ntoo late, it was not, to some, considered a lasting tragedy.\n\nIn fact it was quite extraordinary how the moral judgments of those not\ndirectly involved (and not wanting trouble themselves) were able to\nbend to accommodate the bloodshed all around them.  Not that some\ndidn't mourn, and all weren't scared and angry.  But at such times the\nNeville Chamberlains and Arthur Vandenberg's of the world are always\nfound in great abundance; and when was the last time YOU tried to break\nup a fight while others watched, or came to the aid of a lesser\nacquaintance clearly wronged?\n\nMan's new life among the cold, distant stars, whatever other effects it\nmight have had upon humanity, had not, as the romantic had hoped at the\ndawn of the Space Age, brought people closer together, or taught us\nonce and for all the need for brotherhood, peace, and mutual\nunderstanding.  For human nature is nothing if not stubborn, and where\nthere is a will to be ignorant, somehow a way will be found.\n\nLike a tiny blaze of ignorance, prejudice and Fear:  fanned by the\nwind, the fire had spread.\n\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nEdgar Stone strode down the aisle of the House of Representatives, the\npapers of the speech rolled into a tight scroll in his hand.  The\napplause customary at such an entrance struck him now as feeble, and\nutterly beside the point.\n\nHe was not the only one to feel this.  There was an odd note of\nhollowness and uncertainty in the sound, and those who clapped could\nnot have said themselves why they did so.  Had Stone come to ask for a\nDeclaration of War?  Against whom?  What was the meaning of this\ngathering, with legislators of both House and Senate alike standing\ntense and erect, and cameras poking this way and that?  The very wood\nof that chamber seemed suddenly old and darkling, and in the air a\nthick tension brooded like the coming of a storm.  All talk and\nspeculation lay dead and in the past.  The gathering was seated with a\nrustling sound that echoed dully and impatiently.\n\nStone reached the podium and paused, looking frightened.  Surely the\npretense of enlightenment and self-importance in which he\ncharacteristically wrapped his 'fellow Americans' would ring false in\nthose halls, sullen and filled with ghosts.\n\nHe laid down his papers, despairing to speak.  Never before had he felt\nhimself so plainly laid out on the surgeon's table, under the\nunblinking eye of the camera, waiting for the knife.  He wrestled back\nthe lump in his throat.  He spoke.\n\n\"'You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.'  These\nwords were spoken long ago by the man whom many of us profess to be the\nSon of God.  His ideals were ever kept in the minds of those who shaped\nthis nation, who lived and died---\"  He nearly sobbed, though he could\nnot have said why.  \"Who fought for this country in its darkest\nhours.....  It is in His name that we are now asked to go to war.\"  His\nvoice grew stronger, though again he could not have said why.\n\n\"And yet this same truth He spoke of, and that many so-called patriots\nnow trumpet so loudly, has been denied us, buried beneath a flood of\nhalf-truths and propaganda.  You.....  WE have been deceived, and made\nto commit murder in the name of the things we hold most dear.\"\n\nA murmur of astonishment ran through the crowd, and those who watched\nfrom every corner of the Commonwealth, whether live or distance\ndelayed, felt strange and conflicting emotions stir inside them.\n\n\"This very night, July 15, the time of our self-deception, our imagined\nsafety, is over.  A dreadful choice lies before us.\"  Again the murmur\nstarted, but Stone cut it short, fearing at any moment to lose his\ncourage.\n\n\"The Secretary of State of the United Commonwealth, Charles William\nHayes, has attempted to blackmail his President, and force us all into\na war that can only result in the loss of millions of lives, if not the\nutter collapse of galactic civilization as we know it.\"  He forced\nhimself to go on.  \"And there are some within the military\nestablishment. . .within this very room, who may stand behind him in\nthe attempt.....\n\n\"I did not order the attack on Athena.  I did not authorize, and flatly\ncondemn, the ruthless slaughter at the Battle of Schiller.\"\n\nAt this point Stone grew angry, and felt a deep swelling of the heart\nthat astonished him:  the throb of genuine righteousness.  Or so it\nseemed to him then.  He glared at the assembly, placed his hands firmly\non the lip of\nthe podium, and continued in a voice he could hardly believe was his\nown.\n\n\"This - is - the UNITED COMMONWEALTH OF AMERICA, created by some of the\nablest minds in history, founded in courage, and dedicated to the dream\nof freedom for ALL.  This - is - MY HOME!  This is NOT Nazi Germany.\nAnd so help me God, I will not let it become a slaughter-house for the\nobsessions of a madman!  This is not a nation run by generals, or ruled\nat the point of a gun.\"  He realized he had strayed from the speech,\nand he felt himself waver.  But stubbornly he pushed on.\n\n\"The Constitution established three branches of government, to insure a\nsystem of check and balances:  to insure that no man, or group of men,\nbecame so powerful as to override all others, and manipulate or destroy\nthe common decency of the people.\n\n\"And yet FORMER General Hayes would change all that, to say that if the\nPresident was not to his liking, or the Congress would not give him\nwhat he wanted, he could break away, and make war on his own.  He has\ndone it.  And to be sure that we will follow him, he has struck the\nSoviets across the face, and challenged them to a duel to the death.\n\n\"Even now I cannot tell you how events will turn.....\"  He paused,\nlooked down at the speech before him.  Ten pages at least remained.\nBut his passion and energies were spent.  He wondered then briefly if\nhe had done the right thing.  He told himself the question was\nirrelevant:  he had done all he could.\n\n\"My Vice President will now tell you the details, and how we plan to\ndeal with this crisis.\"  He stepped down, and strode out of the silent\nroom.\n\nPlant, stunned but not yet daunted, stepped down from his seat beside\nthe Speaker of the House, and took up the papers left for him.\nOmitting the passages and emotional phrases now rendered superfluous by\nStone's barrage, he read evenly, and after a time, calmly and clearly.\nHe relayed the pertinent facts behind the rift, including, in full, the\nletters of Hayes to the President.  He also spoke, as dispassionately\nas he could, of the threat of war with the Soviets, hoping this added\ndanger would not tip the scales against them.  He concluded with the\nfollowing:\n\n\"It seems to me that the last line of our National Anthem is especially\nrelevant now.  For its undying question, asks not only IF we stand, but\nhow we stand, and why.  To that we MUST answer yes:  our flag still\nwaves, over the land of the FREE, and the home of the BRAVE.  And not\njust brave enough to die in a war that accomplishes nothing, but to\nface up to our mistakes, and put an end to the bloodshed that neither\nside wants.  We must have the courage to cast aside folly and reckless\npride, and say NO to a would-be dictator, who would leave us no such\nchoice.\n\n\"As of this moment, and by direct order of the President and\nCommander-in-Chief, Charles William Hayes is no longer Secretary of\nState.  He is no longer a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, nor a\nranking member of the military establishment.  He is hereby ordered to\nreturn at once with the forces he has commandeered; and any who choose\nto further defy the Constitution of the United Commonwealth, Mr. Hayes\nincluded, will be brought to trial for treason.\"\n\nHere he felt the same trepidation that Stone had experienced.  Had they\ngone too far?  Or would this forced reasoning break through?\n\n\"We regret the necessity for this order, and that we have not been able\nto be more forthcoming until now.  But quite obviously, matters of the\ngravest national security are involved.  We must deal with former\nSecretary Hayes at once, then turn our attention to Moscow.  We will\ncontinue to seek a peaceful means of ending both disputes.  But let no\none doubt our resolve.\n\n\"May God be with us in this just endeavor.  Thank you.\"\n\nPlant left the chamber, to the same, deafening silence.\n\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nOn the morning of the day after, Stone, Plant and Bacon sat at a curved\ntable facing a viewscreen connected by direct phone-link to the\nKremlin.  For their own part they sent a visual projection.  After\nexchanging terse formalities, Denisov did the same.  His square face\nwith its black hair and thick eyebrows appeared, the dark clear eyes\nbeneath, scrutinizing each face carefully.  On one side of him sat the\nChairman of the Presidium, on the other, the Minister of Defense.\nDenisov did not wait to be asked.\n\n\"A pretty speech, to be sure, and an eloquent letter to our ambassador\nin Washington.  It is too bad that General Hayes will never hear of it.\n He might have made an even prettier speech in return.\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't he hear of it?\" asked Stone, unwisely.  \"The\nbroadcast and letter of dismissal have been relayed to him.\"\n\n\"Mr. President.  You have your Star Gate, for now, but it seems that\nyour communications networks are grossly inferior to our own.  Or\nperhaps your intelligence services have wavered in their loyalties, and\nare no longer reliable.  The Third Fleet has not been at its last\nstated position for days.\"  At this Stone shot a quick glance at Plant,\nwho remained impassive.  \"Your bird has flown the cage.  Can you\npromise me it will not land again to our detriment?\"\n\nThe President scowled and would have switched off the visual, but Plant\nput a hand to his wrist.  His manner was calm and unruffled.\n\n\"Premier Denisov.  You are known as a man of many facets, and once\nagain you hide your true intentions.  That Hayes has gone is neither\nsurprising, nor wholly unexpected.  But you play a dangerous game when\nyou speak of military capabilities, and imagined weaknesses.  I cannot\nbelieve that you really want a full-scale confrontation.  You know as\nwell as I do, such a war would be disastrous to us both.\"\n\nNow it was Denisov who scowled, and began to speak roughly.  But Plant\ninterrupted him firmly.\n\n\"Let's cut to the chase.  You want to turn the current instability to\nyour own advantage.  You want to seize new territories.  But before you\ndo, I'd advise you to look at the larger picture.  Hayes is out of\ncontrol, and until we stop him, millions of innocents are in peril.\nYou have your interests and we have ours; but I cannot believe so many\nhuman lives do not concern you.  I'm asking you to put aside our\ndifferences, and help us make things right again.  Help us bring Hayes\nto justice, peacefully, and with a minimum of bloodshed.\"\n\n\"Help you?\" scoffed Denisov.  \"Help YOU?  We could have put an end to\nthis nonsense before it began!  Or have you forgotten the Cantons, the\nlittle play-toy Nazis who started it all?  You made another pretty\nspeech then, about non-interference, and the self-determination of free\npeoples.  And yet again when the Belgians and Swiss openly declared\nthemselves.  We could have crushed them like the pitiful insects they\nare!  But again you tied our hands.  You may take little pleasure in\nthe fact, but whatever our dealings with you, one more attack from that\nquarter and we will end their puny noise forever.  Help YOU!\"\n\nPlant stuck to his guns, though with difficulty.  How did one dispute\nfacts that were essentially correct, however twisted for personal gain?\n\n\"NONE of this, Premier Denisov, NONE of it, is relevant now.  We have\nadmitted our mistakes, and extended to you the hand of reconciliation.\nDo you take it?  Make your purpose clear.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mr. VICE-president.  I will tell you exactly where the\npeoples of the Soviet Space Republics stand.\"  He paused, as if calling\nto mind a prepared speech.\n\n\"We are not yet at full-scale war with you.  But we have no intention\nof letting Hayes run loose, or of having our hands tied anywhere in the\ngalaxy, in dealing with the crisis as we see fit.  And should we\nencounter ANY hostile force within Soviet space or that of our allies,\nwe shall deal with them as declared enemies.  If you should reach the\nThird Fleet before us, and bring it under your firm control, so be it.\nBut if we come upon Hayes first we will not be gentle, or stop to\nnegotiate.\n\n\"As a further sign of our firm resolve in this matter, we are recalling\nour ambassador from Washington and breaking off formal relations with\nyou.  If you have anything to say to us in future, that is worth\nhearing, you may reach me directly, here.  That is all.\"\n\nThe screen went blank.  The transmission ended.  Stone, Plant and Bacon\nwere silent.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe following day Stone met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and had\nthem each swear a further oath of allegiance to him, their\nCommander-in-Chief, to serve no other, and to have no secret dealings\nwith Hayes.  He then appointed new heads of the Army and Space Navy,\nand those who would not submit were dismissed.\n\nThere was angry shouting, and much hard feeling, but no violence in the\ntransition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nIsograph:  7/20 to 12/30\n\n\nNot on the socialist and pioneer alone did the hammer-stroke fall.  Nor\nwas the sword always wielded by those without a cause, to the detriment\nof the noble and just.  This struggle, this convulsion of wills, was a\nhuman reality, and therefore complex.\n\nLike and yet unlike so many wars before it, this conflict, neither\nlarge nor glorious, was fought on a myriad of battlefields, where\nreasons were often lost, and morals obscured.  The constraints of\ncivilization had been removed, freeing men, both good and evil, to\ncommune once more with their darker nature.  That was all.  And that\nwas more than enough.\n\nThere was but a single unifying link among the sprawl of planets and\npeoples caught up, involved, willingly or not, in this unraveling:  all\nthose who transgressed were filled with the desire to take, at the\nexpense and death of others, and those who were transgressed upon,\nfought with all they had not to yield up the pebbles of home, seeds of\nfamily, and grains of meaning they had found.  And whether right or\nwrong, wise, brave or foolish, they bled.\n\n\nPart, the First\n\n\n                The breast of woman is the very temple of Nature\n                Transporting the mind and body of Man\n                        To other places,\n                Other times, where beings struggled\n                In endless rhythm with the forces\n                        that seek to drag us back to earth.\n                Mystical, beautiful, oh Woman\n                You are the crown of creation:\n                The pure and holy vessel of new life.\n                Oh, glory of this world\n                Keep me forever young!\n\n                                        ---unnamed Irish poet\n\n\n\nThe Irish planet-colony of New Belfast was rich and fertile.  The air\nwas infinitely breathable and sustaining, the vegetation lush, with\nroots that went deep into the ground.  It was a land and sea that men\ncould be proud to die for, a place where family could mean something,\nand women grow old without feeling lost.  To watch a young maid walk\nhere among the fields, to see the depths in her eyes that reflected the\nmelancholy of her soul, and hear the Gaelic accent touch lightly on the\nstones of moss-covered walls, was to know that God gave love to Man.\nLife flowed in its every vein, and the minor modes of Baroque ballads\nseemed to form a living chain to many pasts.\n\nIt was also a place coveted by the French Elite, who knew all that the\nIrish knew of love and land and harvest, but knew it better, and\ntherefore contrived to take from these coarse, uncultured folk what\ncould more fruitfully be employed by themselves.\n\nAnd so a siege was laid, in which the Free French took no part, and\neven loudly decried.  But due to a peculiar Dual Constitution enacted\nlate in the twenty-first century---at which time the French, desiring\nto show their independence, frank difference, and superiority to the\nrest of the world, had created a political structure wholly new and\nuntried---their approval was not needed for a military venture\nutilizing French Elite forces.\n\nNew Belfast was surrounded and cut off.  And as the Irish had only one\nother major holding, the green homeland of Earth, and few outposts\nclose at hand, it was unlikely that sufficient help would arrive before\nthe colonists were overthrown and new, foreign defenses erected---new,\nforeign erections defended.\n\nAnd United Ireland* as well, for reasons no foreigner could quite\ncomprehend, had established few ties or alliances with the vast expanse\nbeyond its islands, except for a continuing dialogue with their many\ndescendants living in the Commonwealth, which they had always, until\nnow, considered protection enough.\n\n..........\n\n\n*The province of Northern Ireland had been restored in time by the\nBritish not because the mindless violence of the IRA had succeeded, but\nbecause it had failed.  The bitter cycle of hatred had finally, toward\nthe mid 22nd Century, diffused, and both sides forgotten their\nindisputable righteousness long enough to come to the bargaining table,\nwhere a mutually acceptable agreement had been reached.\n\n\n\n...........................\n\n\nBut at the moment the Americans had other things on their minds.  Hayes\nwas still on the loose, the Soviets were brewing mischief of their own,\nand Stone had been assassinated.\n\nThe protective shields and outer defenses of the planet were strong, as\nwere the staunch will of both soldier and civilian who manned and\nsupported them.  But the offensive capabilities of the French were not\nto be underestimated.  Not for nothing had they ruled most of Europe\nunder Bonaparte (though they seemed better at taking territory than\nholding it).  Who would prevail?\n\nThe United British Kingdoms kept a consulate and Consul-general on New\nBelfast (though he was seldom petitioned or asked for advice), and on\nthe morning of October 10, a fortnight after the siege and assault had\nbegun, he appeared at the residence of the Planetary Governor with a\nproposal from British Prime Minister Blackwood, and tentatively\napproved by Parliament, to lend military assistance in the crisis.  He\nwas received with the stiff politeness characteristic of modern\nEnglish-Irish relations, and conducted to a polished oak drawing room\nto wait.\n\nAfter a short time the Governor entered with an assistant, looking\nhaggard and worn, and skeptical as to the meaning of his visit.  A\nbutler came when called, and brought them brandy.  Consul Witherspoon\nspoke first, intending to address the issue at once.\n\n\"Governor Gale,\" he began, unable yet to relinquish the formality of\nhis profession.  \"I know you have many things on your mind and that\nyour time is short, so I shall come directly to the point.\"\n\n\"Please do.\"\n\n\"Very well.  The assault brought upon you by the French is both\nformidable and determined, and though your defenses are strong and your\nmen fight bravely, you cannot hope to withstand them much longer.  Your\nshields won't absorb the pounding forever, and you've not the resources\nfor a serious counter-attack on the adversarial fleets.\"\n\n\"You said you'd be coming to the point.\"\n\n\"And I intend to do just that.  Your help from outer-Earth will not\narrive for several weeks at least, and when it does New Belfast may no\nlonger be yours to defend.\"  Gale grumbled something about 'pointless'\nand 'salt in our wounds', but Witherspoon pushed forward.\n\n\"Prime Minister Blackwood, then, has sent me to make the following\nproposal.  The United Kingdoms have a strength of three hundred ships\nstationed at Drake Outpost, which could be brought to your aid\nwithin---\"\n\n\"Oh, I dare say.  And what, pray, shall good Minister Blackthorne (for\nsome reason Gale always called him this) and the noble English receive\nin return?\"\n\n\"I won't lie to you, Governor.  That's not why I've come.  We are not\nacting entirely unselfishly, of course.  That is not the point.\"\n\n\"Then what is the point?  And first I'd be pleased to know what it is\nyou're after.\"\n\n\"The point is survival, Governor, the lessons of which.....  Nevermind.\n As for Britain's further intentions, I can only say that we want\nnothing from the Irish of New Belfast, except perhaps a posture more\nopen to diplomacy and trade.\"\n\n\"And now you'll be telling us how to survive,\" stole Gale gruffly.\n\n\"There are many kinds of survival, Governor, and many threats to them\nall, as we both know.  There is undoubtedly a kind of survival that the\nEnglish could learn from you:  faith in life, perhaps, or the freeing\nof caged emotions.\"  Witherspoon was himself aware that his tone had\ngrown more confidential, and that he was violating the learned rules of\ndiplomacy.\n\nBut he let it happen.  He loved this place and its people, if not\nalways understanding them, and instinct, or something deeper, told him\nthat calm indifference would get him nowhere.  \"If I may say this much,\nman to man, I would advise you. . .ask you. . .to accept help where and\nhow you find it.  We were in a similar position once ourselves, not so\nvery long ago.  During the Blitzkrieg our need was every bit as\ndesperate.  We had to relearn a good deal that we thought we knew, and\nreassess what was truly strong in ourselves.\"\n\n\"That was an entirely different matter.\"  With this Gale's assistant\ntapped his watch, as if to remind him of something.\n\n\"You will excuse me, Consul.\"\n\n\"Yes, Governor.  I will return tomorrow and we may discuss it further.\nI'll leave the full proposal here for you to study, if you wish.\"\nWitherspoon reached into a leather briefcase, pulled forth a bound\nmanuscript.  \"Is two o'clock agreeable?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nThey shook hands at parting, and Gale could not help noticing, almost\nin spite of himself, that the Englishman's grip was firm, and that he\nlooked him straight in the eye.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe next day at (precisely) two o'clock he returned.  The same haggard\nlook on Gale's wrinkled face, the same deep oak paneling, the same\nbrandy.  Only this time, Witherspoon noted, the Governor drank\nconsiderably more of it.  Also, there was no assistant.\n\n\"I have been reading Blackthorne's proposal, Consul, so that now I know\nthe details of what you're offering, though little more of what you\nintend.\"  He looked up searchingly, surprisingly, into the other's\neyes.  \"Listen to me, John.  Man to man, as you said before, I NEED TO\nKNOW WHAT HE'S AFTER.\"  \n\nWitherspoon felt a spark of hope.\n\n\"I honestly don't know, Governor.  I suspect it has more to do with\nhurting the French than helping you.  Blackwood is, in fact, a\nthrowback of sorts:  an adventurer, an aggressive doer.  But whatever\nhis reasons, you have to believe me:  I wouldn't be here, speaking to\nyou like this, if I thought they were to your detriment.  And it is\nhelp unlooked-for in an hour of need.  Won't you take it?\"\n\nThis did not satisfy the Irishman, and as if to further voice his\ndoubts, or play them once more through his mind, he returned to an\nearlier, seemingly irrelevant point.\n\n\"You said yesterday that England under the Blitz was similar to our\nplight now, and that if you hadn't swallowed your pride long enough to\ntake help from the Yanks you'd have gone under, and we'd all be\nspeaking German.\"\n\n\"You read more than I in---\"\n\n\"No, John.  I read WHAT you intend.  Forget your English arrogance, and\ngive me credit for half a brain at least.\"  The consul nodded.  \"That,\nas I'm telling you, was an entirely different matter.  The Brits had\ntheir empire then, their corruption, and oppression of peoples they\nthought less of than themselves.\"  His eyes glinted.  \"Imperial\nDestiny, and a lot of other high-sounding rot.  Well.  You were only\npaying your dues for taking more than was given you, and reaping your\nown bitter harvest.\"\n\n\"If you'll forgive my frankness, Governor, that's a lot of stuff and\nyour know it.  Whether our leaders did right or wrong in ruling the\nEmpire, the PEOPLE of Britain were hardly to blame.  As if cause and\neffect, or God's justice, had anything to do with it.\"  He spoke now\nwith a passion that was strange for the Irishman to see.\n\n\"We were buckled to our knees, with all we thought strong and\neverlasting crumbling around us.  V-2 missiles, wave after wave of the\nLuftwaffe, propeller bombs falling silently and unexpectedly. . .our\nfleets and supply convoys decimated by U-boats, bad news, and the word\nof loved ones lost coming in every day.\n\n\"And if we fell, Governor, who would have guarded the rest of Europe?\nor even the thick-headed Irish, that the Germans were so fond of?  The\nAmericans?  It took the loss of half their Pacific fleet at Pearl\nHarbor before most of them even knew there was a war on.  Churchill\nwept the day it happened, because he knew that they had finally been\nroused.  You're a hard and shrewd old father, Gale, but you leave the\npath of wisdom when you speak lightly of England's part in that Debate.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" put in the other, trying to be indignant.  \"But at least the\nAmericans didn't rub it in your face.\"\n\n\"So now we're talking about pride, are we?\"  Without realizing it,\nWitherspoon had begun to speak (and think) in the way of the natives.\nHe had lived there for seven years, from the time he was thirty.\n\n\"If you think we liked being in their debt, both literally and\nfiguratively, you're mistaken.  But we had to survive.  We had to hang\non, so we did what we had to do.  Don't you see, it's not a question of\nprinciples, or faith, or anything else at all.  It's reality; it's war;\nand the extinction of lives and irreplaceable treasures is final.\nDidn't we learn that all too well?\n\n\"And what did we get in return for our heroic stand?  We took all the\nearly pounding, along with the Russians, absorbed the enemy's worst\nblows, only to have the Yanks come charging in late in the game, and\ntake all the credit for final victory.  Financially we'd have been\nbetter off to declare war on the Americans ourselves, and then lose.\nThey went in afterward like good Samaritans and rebuilt the factories\nof Germany and Japan, and set them well on their feet for a run at the\nmodern age.  And what was left for England, not so very long before the\nmost powerful nation on Earth?  Naught but a mountain of debt, a\ncrumbled economy, and the laughter of the world for the aging lion, no\nlonger able even to hold its own among the shifting tides of fate.\n\n\"You say we were only paying our dues.  Well if that's so then we paid\nthem in full, and not an ha'penny short.  Not that the Irish wasted any\ntears on our behalf.\"  Now it was his eyes that glowered.\n\nThe Irishman drained his snifter and let it fall wearily to the woven\nrug.  He looked now truly old and weather beaten, proud still, but with\nvery little hope left.  Witherspoon had time to recover himself.\n\n\"Please, Bryan.  Won't you at least pass the message on to your\napproaching fleets?\"  He knew their Commander's name and (complete)\nauthority, even his current location; but this was no time to flaunt\nthe thoroughness of British intelligence.  \"I love New Belfast as much\nas anyone.  You don't know what it's given me.  If it goes down to the\nbloody French Elite, a part of me will die as well.\"\n\nGale looked up, and saw to his astonishment that there were standing\ntears in the younger man's eyes.  He lowered his head again, shook it,\nand said finally, heavily.  \"I'll think about it.\"\n\n\"Do this one thing for me, Bryan, I beg.  Don't think too long.  Or\nthere will be nothing left to defend.\"  He rose and left the room.\n\nThe next day, Gale relayed Blackwood's proposal to Commander Donovan,\nventuring to suggest that the way things were---desperate---perhaps it\ncould be considered as a fall-back position.  After the necessary\nsignal delay (and not two minutes later) he received the following\nreply, an audio/visual recording.\n\n\"Have you lost your mind, man?  I'd sooner make a pact with the Devil.\nYou just do your job and hold 'em off until we get there, or I'll\nreplace you with someone of stouter fiber and longer memory.  Help from\nthe English, indeed!\"  And that was the end of it.\n\nNew Belfast fell to the enemy, and could not be retaken.\n\nHere, at least, was a clear moral for anyone to read.  By facing the\ndarkness alone and stubbornly, refusing all help, by not using\nunsparingly all the resources at their disposal, and by placing beliefs\nin constraining patterns upon a world where no such narrow order\nexisted, the frontier Irish were swept away.  And all their heart,\ncourage and past, all their faith in life and beauty of soul were\nrendered meaningless, and in the end amounted to naught, because of it.\n\nBut for one disturbing question.  What was Blackwood really after?\n\n\n\n\n\nPart, the Second\n\n\n                                The wind, she blows extreme\n                                My mind would scream\n                                        But for the discipline\n                                That empty years have taught it.\n\n\nRichard Dark, a denaturalized American citizen, had risen swiftly\nthrough the ranks of the (People's Republic of) Chinese Army, and\nbecause of his technical understanding and combat experience, along\nwith the marked favor of vice-Chairman Tam, had been put in charge of\nthe Outer Fences of the two settled planets of the Tsingtao system, now\nunder attack by Soviet-backed Cuban forces.\n\nViewed mockingly by some, since they were not accompanied by a powerful\nSpace Navy, these unique defenses were nonetheless a highly effective\nform of planetary cover.  Invented by Dark himself, in conjunction with\nthe exiled physicist Tolstoy (both men had chosen not to reveal the\nfull discovery to their native governments, and were therefore\noutcast), they were based on a combined series of shields and orbiting\nArtillery Stations, similar to, but more highly integrated than those\nof the East Germans, in that the shields themselves were wrapped about\nthe great mace-shapes of the Stations like nets of energy strung\nbetween harbor mines.\n\nBut what made them effective was the source of their power.  Not only\ndid they feed off the sun, but also used the very energy of assaulting\nblasts to strengthen the fields, and channel the drawn-off power into a\nreverse stroke by the corresponding station---like an aimed mirror of\naggression.  The harder an opponent struck, the harder was the blow\nreturned.\n\nThough much of the final figuring had been Tolstoy's, the inspiration\nand early experiments all belonged to Dark.  The idea had first come to\nhim during one of his many visits to the Taoist monastery near his home\nin Manchuria, where he had been raised by his father, a stern U.C. Army\nCaptain stationed there.  Of all the things he had learned (the\nShao-lin had let him ask all the questions he liked, though they seldom\nanswered directly or in full), one precept of the Kung Fu style of\nfighting had always intrigued him most deeply:\n\nIf a man, in hand-to-hand combat with another, could turn the force of\nhis opponent's assault back upon him, adding to it the strength of his\nown spirit, why couldn't a machine, or even a defense field, do the\nsame?  He had carried this thought through all the years of his\nscientific and worldly education, and while serving in the Commonwealth\nSpace Navy during the Manxsome conflict, had seen first-hand the need\nfor such a defense:  a way for the week to hold off the strong.\n\nHe had also been severely wounded, and nearly died, when his ship's own\nforce-shields had been broken, and the exposed vessel riven with\nagonizing heat.  The next four years had been spent in hospitals and\noperating rooms where, remarkably, he had slowly recovered with no\npermanent (physical) damage.\n\nIn fact, though his life totaled only twenty-nine Earth years, they had\nbeen lived with such intensity and trauma, through no conscious choice\nof his own, that while he was considerably younger than most of the\nofficers under him, he was, in his way, more experience, time-wizened\n(and weary of life) than nearly all of them.  If hope, despair, and\nnearness to death are the great teachers of this existence, then here\nwas a student who knew the lists by rote.\n\nHe stood now in the engineering room of Power Station One, at the heart\nof the Fences surrounding the planet Ten Hsiao-p'ang, examining damage\nreports.  The Cubans, after trying for a week to storm the defenses of\nboth planets at once, had decided to concentrate their forces upon Teng\nalong, believing, correctly, that once it fell, the power of the other\nwould be diminished as well.  Though Dark's shields still held, the\noutlook was not bright.  For even a mirror may be destroyed by a well\naimed and determined laser; and the colonies had to hold out for\nanother month at least.\n\n\"I don't know why I try,\" he muttered to himself.  He switched off the\nlast tracer diagram, leaned on the railing heavily.\n\nIT'S FUNNY, REALLY.  LIKE A STUPID GAME I CAN'T POSSIBLY WIN.  I JUST\nPLAY IT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.  This assault had become\na symbol, and more than a symbol to him.  If these planets fell,\ncrushing forever his last dreams of a home, then the efforts of a\nlifetime had been wasted.\n\nHere he had resolved to make his final stand.  No more running:\nfleeing from his body's weakness, and before the haunting loneliness,\nthe creeping paralysis of a life without love, companionship, or the\nsimplest human feeling of attachment.  Here he would stand, until he\nwas either conquered or set free, or surrendered in death the slender\nsinews that knitted his soul to flesh.  A defeatist's attitude, some\nmight say, but for this important difference.  He had spent a lifetime\nlearning how not to surrender, and he did not intend to lose.\n\nAn under-officer, the closest thing to a friend he had, approached him.\n\n\"Richard.  Commander Chang says his station can hold them no longer.\nThey've singled him out and are pounding it apart.  The fields are\noverloaded and the power can't be channeled back fast enough.\"\n\n\"Tell him he HAS to hold them.  I'll release the Harrier Squadrons as\nsoon as they're massed and I know it's safe.  Then we'll try to rotate\nhim in; but no promises.\"\n\nKim looked dispirited, started to walk away.  Dark clasped the thick of\nhis sleeve.\n\n\"Tell him I haven't forgotten them.  It will just be a while longer.\"\n\nWhen the time came, he released the Harriers.  Their mission was\nsuccessful, and the more damaged stations were rotated back into the\ninner circle, replaced by those that had not yet faced the enemy eye to\neye.  But a dozen ships were lost and that tactic, by its very use, had\nbeen rendered less effective.  The adversary knew it now, and would\nwatch for signs of its reuse.\n\nThe progression slowly passed before the designated hours of his\nsleep---he needed only eight in thirty-six---and the Cuban fleets\nwithdrew to regroup.  He remained on the bridge until he was sure it\nwas not a feint, then sought out his own quarters, leaving message to\nwake him if they tried anything new or unexpected.\n\nSafe again within the darkness of his room he lay on his back, unable\nto sleep.  After a time he reached for the microphone beside the bed\nand began a supplemental Log entry, which doubled as his personal\ndiary.  He knew that his enemies might one day use it against him; but\nhe did not care.  He spoke slowly, not letting the words run away with\nhim, pausing often, thinking out loud.  This was the only way he had\nfound of drawing the real knowledge of internal warfare from himself,\nand of rising above the constrictive circle of day-to-day thoughts and\nconcerns.  A part of what he said is recorded here.\n\n\"God they're giving us a hell of a pounding.  How do I tell them?  How\ndo I tell my own men that they have to hang on?\n\n\"When you're under attack. . .and all the things that you believed in,\nor wanted. . .and all your hopes, your reasons for continuing, seem to\ndisappear.  Or seem to be cut off behind you.  And you're left out\nthere. . . can't find any reason for the suffering, it makes no sense.\nIt's impossible to remember the other parts of your existence:  all you\nknow is that. . .you're struggling, you're under attack. . .and there's\nnot a damn thing you can do but to hold on.  Try to deal with it.\n\n\"Maybe I could write something out in the order of the day, if that\nwouldn't be resented.  Go back to Chinese history, and show that their\nancestors, when under attack or political repression. . .the thing they\nall had in common were the things I mentioned earlier.  The struggle to\nendure without knowing why, and stubbornly. . .when the logical thing\nto do, would have been to despair.  And somehow.  You know, what Prince\nAndrei was going through:  the way he. . .was just numbed and\noverpowered by it all.  And he couldn't find any reason or meaning\nanywhere.  How it went beyond words or thought so that, in his heart,\nin the very fiber of his being, he disbelieved in all semblance of hope.\n\n\"Going through the motions. . .never believing that you really have a\nchance for life or happiness.\"\n\nHe massaged his brow, the fingertips out of habit stroking the rough\nstraggle of his eyebrows.  That had been the one area where the plastic\nsurgeons had been unable to restore living hair and skin---the forehead\nand cranial cap.  The new stuff looked real enough, but felt,\nespecially the hair, coarse and unnatural.\n\nFlashing back, he saw in memory the thick gut of blue flame rush toward\nhim as the ship tore apart---closing his eyes in sudden, brittle shock,\nstriking the flames from his forehead with wild slaps of his hands.....\n Not that such memories retained much terror for his waking mind.  It\nwas in sleep, in the subconscious worlds beyond his control, that such\nimages were deadly.\n\nHe remembered also the first grim reawakening, the grotesque nightmare\nof ruinous skin and flesh before the surgeons had begun their work.\nThe days of fever, the endless crises.  He had not, like Prince Andrei\nnear death, felt a comforting presence calling his soul from this\nlife.....  Though now at these memories he felt it shrink back, yet\nagain, from human existence.  And seek escape in his work.\n\n\"And the desire to strike back, too soon, that the younger commanders\nare always advocating.  Urging attacks that can only end in ruin.....\nBut the impulse.  Haven't I felt it?  Lying there in that bed.\"\n\n\"The helpless, trapped feeling. . .the rage that rises inside you,\ntearing through your fatigue.  And you're just so tired. . .so worn out\nphysically. . . that some desperate instinct takes over, telling you to\nattack.  Half crazy from the constant pounding.  So that you want. .\n.not even want. . .that you're forced into this thing.  Like your will\nis being pushed out through the top of your skull.  Something.  And\nsaying no to that urge. . .almost sexual   . . .seems so unfair, and\nbeyond the strength of any man.\n\n\"But it's wrong, an irretrievable mistake, and you know it.  A fatal\nerror that you're just not allowed in that situation.\n\n\"Internal warfare. . .and its relation to.....\"  At last the weariness\nof true sleep was coming over him.  But one more thought remained\nunspoken.\n\n\"And the hardest thing, unlike before.  It's not just my own life\nthat's at stake, but those of all my men.....  My men.  How did I ever\nget into all of this?  This power and responsibility.  I never wanted\nit.  Just my own piece of mind.....  Aahh.\"\n\nTomorrow was another day.  Maybe in the morning things would look\nbrighter.  Morning.  How meaningless the pilgrimage from Earth had made\nthat word.  There would be no dawn, no rising of the sun, only a\ndifferent angle facing it.\n\n'YET DAWN IS EVER THE HOPE OF MEN.'  TOLKIEN, THE TRENCHES, WORLD WAR\nI.  BULLETS POPPING IN THE MUD.....  He rolled over onto the side on\nwhich he slept, the microphone still in his hand.  \"Trench fever.  The\nveterans hospitals.  Feeling he would never get well.....\"  FEVER. .\n.NEVER GET WELL.  COLD FEVER.  NEVER GET WELL.....  NEVER. . .FEELING.\nWith that he fell asleep.\n        And the next day, he rose again to face the onslaught.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart, the Last\n\n\n                When the Zionists took Israel,\n                        Land of their deepest fathers\n                With just cause, and more than that\n                It raised the hopes of many, that empty, horrible\n                                        Holocaust\n                Would not be utterly meaningless.\n\n                Writers, artists, and musicians\n                        Jew and Gentile, belief and disbelieving\n                        Flocked to this new human banner\n                In tribute to this triumph of the soul---\n                        'Exodus' it was called---\n                Imparting unto the new inhabitants, the more so\n                        Because the darkness still remained\n\n                Blank checks of righteousness.\n                Even Wouk, who walked with honesty and selflessness\n                        through two-thousand pages\n                Rightly.  Hoping perhaps, to help the prophesy fulfill\n                Even he, at the end, made this mistake.\n\n                For it is not enough to be right\n                The heart must also remain true.\n\n                        \"Goyim kill Goyim,\n                                and they come to hang the Jews.\"*\n\n*Menachim Begin, Prime Minister of Israel, when questioned whether his\ntroops had allowed Lebanese Christian militia to massacre more than a\nhundred men, women and children in a Palestinian refugee camp.\n\n\nThe Palestinians still had no homeland, after two-hundred and forty\nyears.  The ill-conceived and ill-fated PLO had long since\nself-destructed.  Its thoughtless acts of terrorism could hardly have\ndone less to loosen Israel's grip on the West Bank of the Jordan river,\nor to win favor and sympathy abroad.  And the Israelis themselves (or\nso their actions would seem to indicate) had never for a single instant\nintended to return either Jerusalem to the Moslems, or even to make it\nan international city, such as the Vatican, or Palestine to those who\nhad inhabited it for centuries.\n\nThe Arab nations (excepting Egypt and Jordan), which had continually\nused the Palestinian question as an excuse for violence and religious\nhatred, yet had not loved their orphaned brothers enough to take them\npermanently into their own lands---either Earth nations, or the settled\ncolonies of Space.  Ironically, bitterly, the Palestinians had become\nthe 'wandering Jews' of the post-modern era, living here and there in\nscattered clumps, always vowing vengeance, always being promised future\nacts of restoration:  of home, family, and self-respect.\n\nFinally, in the year 2167, the United Commonwealth had felt a pang of\nconscience (or fashion, or something), and decided to do these poor\nunfortunates a long overdue, and much deserved kind turn.  So a small,\ntillable planet was given to them, along with transports, to bring\ntogether in this new life all those who wished to go.  The Egyptians\nhad then contributed materials for building, the Japanese had added\nfactories and technicians, and the British and Australians, teachers\nand universities to bring the less educated up to date.  The Free\nFrench had provided defense systems, and the French Elite a modest\nfleet (later to be supplemented by the more sophisticated weapons of\nSoviet Space, never far in the background at the birth of a nation they\nhoped to seduce).  All in all, the contributing powers had looked upon\nthe venture as a success, and the Salvation Army humor of the\nCommonwealth was much restored.\n\nBut now, forty years later, the numbers of the Palestinians had grown\ngreat enough, and their force of arms respectable enough, to raise the\nhopes of the embittered and illusioned one last time.  Bolstered yet\nagain by the warlike teachings of the prophet Mohammad, which state\nthat to die in a Holy War is to ensure the soul's salvation, the\nstubborn and simple among them had seized power from the more educated\nand enlightened moderates, and prepared, in secret, a last attempt at\ntrue retribution.\n\nTo accomplish their aims, the radicals (supported by most within the\ncountry, strongly challenged by none), would have to violate all the\nsanctions of the civilized world, including the Green Earth Pact, and\nthe unspoken, though severely understood, international policy of\nnon-violence upon the Earth itself.  But what of that?  GOD was with\nthem.\n\nFor they did not intend merely to hurt the Israelis symbolically, or to\nsteal from them some distant and less guarded settlement, but to return\nin triumph to their true home, and the land of their most ancient\nfathers.  Given to them by Allah himself.....\n\nPalestine!\n\nThe Green Earth Pact, as it was called, had been enacted (and\nunanimously approved) by the United Nations, to insure the peace and\nneutrality of the beloved home planet of all humanity, which had so\nnarrowly escaped war's destruction and environmental catastrophe during\nthe Nuclear Age.  Among other clauses designed to protect the fragile\nenvironment, so long and senselessly abused, it specified that no more\nthan one-hundred military vessels of any given nation, and these of\nlimited size and destructive capability, were to enter the parochial\nSolar System at any one time, and that no more than half that number\ncould engage an Earth orbit or rest upon the Moon.  And except in\nsudden crisis of defense, absolutely none were allowed to pierce the\nupper atmosphere.\n\nAnd so one hundred Palestinian vessels were sent, mostly fighters,\nmanned not by the best trained pilots and soldiers, but by the most\nfervent believers, and those with the deepest grudge.  Under the\npretext of diplomatic and training purposes they came, believing\nagainst all Satan's whisperings that if once, by their own actions they\ncould retake that sacred land, some miracle of God would allow them to\nkeep it.\n\nHalf remained at the legal distance, the other half locking in around\nthe Earth.  After visiting with the Soviets, the Syrians, and the\nSaudis, betraying their true purpose to none, the fifty vessels broke\nsuddenly from orbit and rushed down upon the tiny speck of land known\nas modern Israel  ---before that Palestine, before that Judea, and so\non back into the dawn of history, when it had been little more than a\nforbidding desert, endlessly fought over by tribes and Empires until it\nwas hard to say (and still harder to care) who had been there first, or\nwhy.\n\nIn one sense at least, the modern Israelis had not changed from the\nturbulent and close-knit times of the 1950's and 60's.  When it came to\ndefense, they took nothing for granted.  At the instant the first\nPalestinian fighters began to dive, they had released their own fifty,\nmore sophisticated craft, and in conjunction with the best ground\nbatteries on the planet Earth, cut short the brave but foolish attack.\nNo prisoners were taken.\n\nFor the next several days, in Western publications circulated\nthroughout the settled galaxy, the headlines, columns and editorial\npages all expressed the same outrage, decrying the viciousness and\nsmall-mindedness of the Palestinian attack; and the Israelis were freed\nonce more to expound upon the necessities of their hard-nosed,\naggressive, and completely intransigent foreign policies.  They also\ntook it upon themselves to retaliate, destroying the remaining forces\nand outer defenses of the exiled Arab planet, 'inadvertently' killing\nthousands of civilians in the process.\n\nThe moral?  Pointless insanity on all sides, that had gone on for three\ncenturies.  BECAUSE IT HAD GONE UNCHALLENGED.\n\n\n*                        *                        *\n\n\n\"The next time you start to get angry, count to ten.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nELEVEN\n\n\n\"Did it never strike you as just a trifle odd that the Cantons\ndestroyed the Laurian ore planet, instead of just taking the colonies\nby force?  They had the machinery.\"\n\n\"I don't know.  I suppose I always thought that tactic psychological.\nThe whole affair with the gravity beam was quite impressive.\"\n\n\"Yes, and that was the lure of it.  But think.  Who stood to gain by\nsuch an expensive side show?  Who paid the bill, and why?\"\n\n\"The German States?  I don't understand.  I thought they sided with the\nCantons out of principle.\"  Dubcek looked at him like all the fools\nthat had ever been born.\n\n\"Horse-shit.  They did it because they had the equipment to move in and\nsalvage ninety percent of the planet's high-grade ore---the Cantons\ndidn't---and because they could use the station again for other\npurposes.  The move was purely economic:  they got their original\ninvestment back three times over, and flexed their muscles a little in\nthe process.  And (so you know you weren't completely wrong) there is\nthis.  So long as people believe the West Germans are still Nazis at\nheart, it gives them a tremendous psychological weapon:  the aura of\nruthlessness.\"\n\nThe young man stood bewildered, turned his head from side to side as if\ntrying to see something through a fog.  He paused, frozen it seemed,\nand then spoke.\n\n\"But the Canton fleets.  Who supplied them?  Not the German States.\nThat would make them direct accomplices, and---\"\n\n\"Now you are beginning to think like a socialist.  The ships were, in\nfact, of GS build, but they didn't just give them away.  First they\nwere sold to the Belgian-Swiss---along with the arsenal that's headed\nhere---then passed on.  The Alliance needed someone to test the waters,\nand the Cantons were used for that purpose.  The German States could\nnot care less.  Any instability only allows them greater opportunity\nfor profit and expansion.  Play both sides against the middle, then\npick up the pieces; that is their game.  Whether the fascists win or\nlose, they will get their cut.\"  The young man looked incredulous,\nopened his mouth as if to speak.\n\n\"I know, I know---the ideologies.  Ideology always seems the great\nmotive to the young, the reason that nations rise and fall.  It is time\nyou learned that no one, except perhaps a few misguided knights, or\nhere and there a religious fanatic, ever made war for anything other\nthan personal gain.  Though they may have told themselves otherwise.\"\nHe relit his pipe, looking thoughtful.  BUT DUBCEK DIDN'T SMOKE.  \n\n\"I remember when I was young, the great heroes and villains of history\nseemed to play out their parts as emissaries---the Churchills and\nHitlers---instruments of good and evil upon the Earth.  This was\ncentral to all my illusions.  It gave my life as a soldier meaning, and\ndrummed me full of patriotism, and a lot of other high-sounding\nexcrement.  But the hard truth is, Brunner, men make war because they\nthink they can get something out of it, whether money or glory, it\nhardly matters.  They hope to take something by force, that is\notherwise denied to them.\n\n\"Because when you reach my age you come to realize, as they have, that\nthere are no rules. . .except survival of the fittest.  The great\naggressors of history, from the Greeks to the Roman to whoever, took\nwhat they took because no one could stop them.  It is very difficult to\nexplain unless you have lived through it.....\n\n\"MEN rule the galaxy, Brunner.  Men.  There are no unseen forces at\nwork, shaping our destinies to some more perfect end.  You must learn\nto be cynical:  it is the key to all truth.  Forget your fairy-tale\nnotions.  We live or die by our own devices.\"\n\nA lull.\n\n\"Then what.....  What keeps you going?\"  The aging colonel rose and\nwent to a dark window.\n\n\"Life is a game of chess.  And I don't like to lose.\"\n\nBrunner struggle beneath the coverings, feeling smothered.  Suddenly he\nburst forward, eyes open.\n\n\"But you lost!  You LOST.  You lost.....\"  His temples throbbed and he\ncould not remember where he was.  For he was not yet awake.  His dream\nhad played on him the cruelest trick of all.  Thinking to escape from\nthe nightmare world, he had jolted himself insufficiently, and only\ndreamed of waking.  It was all right now.  But no.  There was something\nwrong with the room.  Though incredibly lifelike, it was not quite\nsquare---the walls leaned and corners were uneven.\n\nAnd then they were coming.  Outside the dark window there was a sudden,\nblinding flash.  THEY'RE COMING.  His wife ran through the wall and\ndisappeared.  \"Ara!\"\n\nCOMING.  The Americans.  Nowhere to hide.....\n\nHis head shook violently.  And finally, he was awake.\n\nHe lay on his back, his underclothes drenched with sweat.  As if to\nreassure himself, he rolled over to embrace his wife and drive away the\ndarkness.  But she was not there:  that much of the nightmare was real.\n\nAnd then he remembered.  He was not home on Athena II.  Nor was he in\nhis quarters aboard the Mongoose, waiting sleeplessly for the approach\nof the Alliance fleet.  He was alone and on a Czech destroyer, one of\nseveral, escorted by a Soviet cruiser.  Heading into Belgian space.  To\nsearch for the prisoners, taken from the colonies.  Dubcek was dead.\n\nHe cried softly, hugging his knees, hating himself for his weakness.\n\"God damn the Americans for ever helping them.  I wish I was dead.\"  He\npushed his forehead hard against his knees.\n\nIt will be all right, he told himself.  The Alliance has gone too far\nand now the Soviets will help us.  The colonies will be retaken.\nSchiller is gone, but Athena remains.  My wife is alive.  I will find\nher and we can go home again.  She is alive.  She must be alive!\n\nHe got up and checked the passage of time.  It was still an hour yet\nbefore what men called dawn---little brackets put around life to give\nit meaning and a mean understanding.\n\nThis was not what he wanted:  four hours of sleep was not enough for\nhim now, and his mind was dark again.  Battle could come any day\nnow---he was spoiling, and being eaten by the spoiling, for a fight.\nAnd yet his energies continued to desert him.  His strength grew less\neach day:  no sleep.  Not enough sleep.  No appetite.  Anxiety.  HE\nMUST PRESERVE HIS MENTAL ENDURANCE!  He was the second officer of the\nfirst destroyer, and the man taken into the confidence of Soviet\nColonel Joyce, Commander of the Leningrad.  Leningrad.  He was the\ngo-between, the link between unlike and alien worlds, that now must\nwork together.\n\nHe lifted the picture of his wife from the bedstead, kissed the cold\nglass that kept him from her.  His mind was calm again, his emotions\nflat and worn out.  And he shivered, realizing unexpectedly that it was\ncold in the room.  He felt his brow:  burning, always burning.  The wet\nunderclothes he peeled off and flung away, went into the bathroom,\nreleased a stream of clear, watery urine, turned the heat on high and\ntook a steaming shower.\n\nDried and warm but already sweating and a little chilled he returned to\nthe room and sat down at a desk, and touched a button, and began\nstudying charts of that quadrant.  TRANSPORTS HAD BEEN REPORTED\nMOVING.....  A WEEK AFTER THE TRANSPORTS BEARING THE PRISONERS.....\nHis wife was not on Athena.  LATEST INTELLIGENCE.  SOMETHING CALLED\nDRACUS.....\n\nIt all ran together in his mind, into a crater-pool of formless gray\nmud, edged with hard dark flecks.  They were making for the Morannon\nsystem.  They would be there in seventy. . .eight hours.  Others must\ndo the thinking now, he was tired.  Too tired.  He lay down again and\nforced himself to remain there until he fell asleep.\n\nHe woke two hours later, feeling better but for a slight headache.  He\nrecalled briefly as he rose the half-dream from which his consciousness\nhad climbed.  He was lying on the floor of a public bar, asleep, when a\nlarge rough man had seized him by the shoulders of his jacket and\nlifted him rudely, shook him, and told him to be gone.  At first it\nseemed just another foolish night episode, until he remembered that the\ninitial feeling of the strong, angry hands upon him had been\npleasurable.\n\nHe wondered lamely if this were some sign of latent homosexuality---he\noften feared what might be revealed to him of his subconscious through\ndream---but the thought could not seriously upset him.  A new day was\nat hand and he felt a little better.  He dressed himself, performed the\nmorning rituals of the bathroom and made his way to the bridge, feeling\nas he walked only a slight hollowness and queasiness of the stomach.\nCaptain Mandlik greeted him flatly, the small black eyes in their\nfleshy face neither kind nor cruel.\n\n\"You are up late this morning.\"\n\n\"Yes, forgive me.  I didn't sleep well last night.\"\n\n\"You don't look well.  Have you been to see the doctor?\"\n\n\"No, there is nothing wrong with me.  There is nothing he could do.\"\n\n\"Very well, but look after yourself.  We cannot have you fading out on\nus.\"  The captain looked more deeply into his face.  \"Colonel Joyce has\nbeen asking for you.  He seems to take a special interest in\nyou---believes you have some potential or understanding the rest of us\nlack.\"\n\n\"Yes.  It seems my curse to have lonely old men confide in me.\"\n\n\"Listen to me Brunner,\" said the captain sternly.  \"Don't be that way.\nWe need him.  We need his firepower.  Whether you like it or not, we\nneed you to listen to his every word, and learn what you can from him.\nAccount yourself as befits the situation!  We are in enemy Space now,\nand the Soviet detection screens won't hide us forever.\"\n\n\"Captain.  They are not going to turn and leave us now.\"\n\n\"You must not count on that!  And I am still your commanding officer,\nhowever vague the current status.  Remember that.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nHe performed officiously the duties of a long day, with growing\nimpatience, but simultaneously fearing for the time to pass.  For at\nleast now he still had hope.  He could still imagine the happy reunion\nwith Ara, still picture the moment of finding her:  the tearful embrace\nand releasing of pent-up, brutalized emotions---the lonely hours of\nanguish, always fearing the worst, listening to the battle rage inside\nhim.\n\nAnd yet in the end came the thought, the realization, that he NEEDED TO\nKNOW.  Sixty odd hours, then the battle.  Then the landing on Dracus.\n\nWhen his shift was over he went to the officer's mess and partook, what\nlittle he ate of it, of the evening meal.  He sat alone at an empty\ntable and spoke to no one, but the others were used to this.  With\ndifferent words they all realized that he had sunk very deep into\nhimself, and did not wish to be disturbed in his reverie.  And they\nwere right.  Almost he feared to take comfort in the company of other\nmen, as if this might somehow lessen the prayerful necessity of finding\nhis wife.\n\nHe returned again to his room.  Taking out a pen and pad of paper he\nmade some notes for the following day, then picked up his copy of A\nPORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN, and began to read.  Dragged down\nafter a time by its minute detail and understated hopelessness, he\nplaced a marker in the book and set it down, scrawling idly some verses\nthat came to him then.  Weary and lethargic he lay back on the bed,\nthough he did not yet wish to sleep.\n\nNevertheless he felt his eyelids drooping heavily.  To block it out. .\n.to shut off the day.....  Even for a little while.  But he could not\nsleep now, or he would be unable later.\n\nHe tried thinking of his mother and brother, grateful that she had\nescaped from the destruction of Schiller, and that he, still in\ntraining, would not see combat for some time.  But he was forced to\nadmit that these meant little to him.  His brother's life (until very\nrecently, when he had joined the space navy after the fall of Athena),\nhad taken a different path.  Tomas was an artist, he a soldier.  They\nwere no longer close, as in childhood.  And his mother, too, was like a\ndistant figure, his affection for her a dying ember that the fearful\nwalls of her religion kept any living breeze from ever fanning.  He\ncared for nothing and no one, but Ara.\n\nThe thought came to him again of his own existence without her.  His\nstomach crawled.  He got up and paced back and forth in nervous\nagitation.  This restlessness was maddening!  His mind raced, but could\nseize hold of nothing concrete to calm it.  At length, the mock energy\nexpended, he lay down again and covered his eyes, not caring.....\n\nHe woke two hours later, feeling stifled in his clothes.  And checking\nthe clock he saw that deep night was only just beginning.  And knew\nthat he would not be able to sleep for many hours.  He sat on the edge\nof the bed and took off his shirt.  His arm started for the light\nswitch, but something drew back the hand.  Moved by what he could not\nsay, he reached instead into the drawer of his dressing cabinet and\npulled out from it the thick tallow candle, brass capped, that had been\ngiven him by his wife.  Taking out also the metal igniter, he touched a\nflame to the wick and set it before him.\n\nFor a long time he did not look at his reflected image in the closet\nmirror, holding his head in his hands, incapable of purity of thought\nor emotion.  He felt little outside his own fatigue, but also a slow\nstrange stirring of the soul.\n\nHe looked up, studied his features in the soft, forgiving light of his\nlover.  The face that he had never associated with himself.....  His\neyes were drawn downward to the wiry muscles that reached from his\nchest to his arm.  Always slender and taut, they now looked almost\nfamished, layered rope wrapped stranding and twine after strand into\nnothingness.  What were they for?  And the rage inside him.  Could he\ntear down the walls?  Could he dive through the mirror and come to the\nplace where his wife lay needing him, distraught, possibly frightened\nand in torment?\n\nAnd suddenly the image changed, becoming sinister and spectral.  The\nremembrance was almost audible.\n\n\"And how would you judge me while a Belgian officer was raping your\nwife?\"\n\nCaught in a trap of near despair, simultaneously hit by a rush of dizzy\nsickness---a lethal virus had, in fact, attacked his stomach---his mind\nand courage reeled in a half physical, half emotional torment.\nSnatches of conversations with Dubcek came back to him, echoed and\nenforced, made indisputable by the darkness that hung thick and\nmenacing around him.  They dove and swirled like insane, angry birds.\nHis spirit palled before them.\n\n\"You must learn to be cynical\"\n\n\"Some day you will be hurt very badly\"\n\n\"It is the key to all truth\"\n\n\"Forget your fairy-tale notions\"\n\n\"While a Belgian officer was raping your wife\"\n\n\"You will be hurt\"\n\n\"Very badly\"\n\n\"Raping your wife\"\n\n\"Raping your wife\"\n\n\"Raping your wife---\"\n\n\"Stop it!\" he cried in answer.  \"Get away from me!\"\n\nA foul nausea engulfed him as he staggered toward the bathroom, falling\nto his knees and retching violently into the toilet.  Hardly able to\nbreathe, feeling the very soul torn out his throat, he fell back\nagainst the wall and tile as wave after wave of hot sweat dizziness\nbroke over.  Finally, as if the agony that raped him had expended\nitself he was left, a forlorn and shivering ball on the floor, hopeless\nand friendless and lost.\n\nBut now the cold truth of it was clear, needing no help from the\nphysical assault.  She was gone from him forever.  She had been too\nbeautiful, too spirited.  At best she was the unwilling mistress of a\nbastard animal.  At worst she was dead.  Dubcek was right.  There was\nno unseen God to protect her, no Comforter to see him now and ease his\npain.  He had been a fool, and now he would pay for it.  He should have\ntold her to evacuate.  They should never have come here.  Fool!  Fool!\nFool!\n\nHe wept no tears and shivered and struck the wall weakly with the side\nof his fist.\n\n\"Dear God don't let it be.  Don't leave her!  Don't leave me here.....\"\n He sobbed.  \"Don't leave me.\"\n\nNot much like a prayer that his mother might have taught him, but still\nhe spoke it with all his soul.  A young ensign, hearing his cries, came\nin from the hallway and found him there.  Putting his head through\nBrunner's crooked arm, he lifted him and took him to the Infirmary.\n\nThe doctor had to be wakened, and did not come at once, so that he was\nleft in a half-lying sit in a bed behind a wrap-around screen, given\ntime, as it were, to gather himself.  He felt nothing but weakness and\na blank mental stupor.  That things had gone too far he knew, but to\nwhom should he address this complaint?  He felt as low, though less\nbitter and sharp-edged, as he had ever been in his life.\n\nHe had prayed, and not in the moment of fear and anguish, but in their\nafterglow.  This in itself was enough to show him that Dubcek had not\nwon a convert, though he was still probably right.  But this sense of\nwrongness and self-deprecation began to bring back bitterness.  He shut\nit off.\n\nI'm sorry, Ivan, he said to himself.  You're a good man and I know you\ntried to keep me from being hurt.  But I can't see the world through\nyour eyes, or I despair.....  And I cannot do that yet.  Not while\nthere is any hope.\n\nWith this a ghost inside him seemed to rest more easily.  Or something.\n The doctor drew back the screen and with a sleepy, objective and\ninfinitely forgettable manner began to examine him and ask him\nquestions, mildly rebuking him for not coming sooner.\n\n\"It is obvious that you are suffering from acute anxiety as well as the\nvirus, and that the two feeding off one another have brought you to\nthis state.  I have been told you are here searching for your wife and\nthat is all fine and good, but you must take better care of yourself or\nyou will be of no use to anyone.  I am going to give you an injection\nfor the virus and prescribe lozenges to help you sleep.  Yes, yes I\nknow you do not like to take drugs into your body and if you sleep on\nyour own you will not need them.  I want you to have them anyway.  You\nare to spend this night in hospital and the next two days off duty then\nyou may do as you like but if you have any sense you will put from your\nmind what is beyond your control and guard your health more closely.\nYou are not the only one with problems and concerns in this time of\nunrest, and though you are young.....\"\n\nWhen she left Brunner turned his head to one side against the hard\npillow, still half upright, and let his thoughts and feeling sink down\nlike stirred silt in a stream.  NILEMUD AND CROCODILES.  He remembered\nthe phrase from \"Portrait.\"  What the hell did Nilemud have to do with\nanything?  And why was Joyce always writing about himself?  Did he\nimagine he was the only one who suffered?  And why call Ireland a sow\nthat eats its fodder?  Like murdering a sick patient.\n\nJoyce.  That was the Colonel's name as well.  He wondered if they were\nrelated, or how a Joyce had come to settle in Leningrad.  THE\nLeningrad.  He compared his perceptions of the two.\n\nThus his mind vomited what his body could not, passing time in words,\nuntil he started to feel dizzy again and another rush of anguish folded\nover him.  He endured it, and with almost unselfish reserve except for\nthe thought, again, that it was too much.  Any one of the things he had\nfelt in the past months, heightened now by nearness, might have been\nbearable singly, or even in bunches of two and three.  But all at once\nand one after another was like an endless trap, with no escape from the\nsteady flow of consciousness.  But for sleep, which of late had become\na fickle and untrustworthy ally.\n\nUnbroken flow of consciousness.  Perhaps that was what Joyce had been\nafter (he suspected the thought was not original).  Certainly his\nself-endowed character Stephen had been trapped, feeling rare moments\nof freedom and longing for the sky, but always coming back to himself\nin a dirty world.  More trapped in the human shell than in Dublin.  Did\nhe ever truly fly?  Certainly the rambling phrases were incoherent.....\n\nAnd so at long length his thoughts become more natural and sleep came\nback to him, and shutting his eyesmind and heart, he passed through a\nthick black night without dream.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe next morning after some time alone and a second examination, he\nreturned to his rooms.  Someone had extinguished the candle for him but\nit was still there, the igniter beside it.  He resisted the urge to\ncontact Mandlik and ask him how many hours, or had they yet been\ndiscovered.  There was no reason, he knew, to go looking for a fight.\nIt would come to him.  He had had time to work things through, and\nbelieved he now possessed a clearer understanding.\n\nThe first few moments in that place were difficult, for all his renewed\nspirit of resolve.  To be left here in this state, weakened and\nsick.....  He still feared for the future, which he knew stalked him\ninexorably.  At stake, no more and no less than his spiritual life and\ndeath.  It was no use trying to prepare himself against all\ncontingencies.  If his wife was not there, or was dead or\nunaccounted-for, a part of himself would die forever, and the tiny\nflame of faith to which he clung would be lost beyond recall.  Even now\nit flickered feebly in that dark place, shivered by the cold winds of\ndoubt.\n\nHe mastered his trepid nature as best he could, and stayed there.  He\nlay down and read for many hours, somewhat heartened by his mind's\nendurance, and by the sudden turn from hopelessness he perceived in\nJoyce's work.  'Exiles.'  It filled all his mind with true thought and\ncarried him for a time from himself, and he loved in those moments both\nthe medium and the man, so beyond his understanding.\n\nMoved as it were to make some account of himself he rose, wrapped the\nrobe about him, went to the desk-table and, without looking at the\nverses he had scrawled the day before, wrote a simple, passionate poem\nto his wife.\n\nBut the feelings went too deep and he could not yet read back what he\nhad written.\n\nHe called and a nurse brought him a soft and frugal meal, and before\nshe left he looked into her face and said sincerely, \"Thank you,\" for\nshe had reminded him that other lives existed outside his own.\n\nAfter he ate for a time he was unwell, and lay down in the bed and\nwaited for the aching nausea to pass.  Weariness and exhaustion came\nover him when the other left, and having little choice, yet also\nwanting to trust, he surrendered.  And after a further time he slept.\n\nHe did not wake until late in the evening.  Without looking or even\nthinking about the clock he went to his writing desk and flipped over\nthe written pages of the pad.  A thought had come to him, whether in\ndream or rising from it he could not recall, nor did it matter.  He had\nhis answer.  He wrote on a blank sheet of paper with a quiet warm peace\ninside him:\n\nIf you believe in too much, or nothing at all, either way you will be\nhurt.\n\nWith this he became calm and thoughtful.  What was the use of despair,\nor endless worry?  Running around wildly, trying by one's own efforts\nto turn back an imagined tide of evil and malicious fate, or believing,\nat the most, that life was nothing but a primal struggle without order\nor lasting hope.  If there truly was nothing beyond man and the grave,\nthen what was the use of trying at all? when the bravest and most\ndetermined lives must eventually end in ruin and death?  In this sense\neven the existentialists were wiser than the proponents of human will\nand self-made destiny.\n\nAnd on the other side of the coin, were those who put their faith and\ntrust in Gods and religions they did not understand, accepting without\ntrial or common sense the narrow dogmas of fearful (or even wise) old\nmen.  MEN.  What made their observations and conclusions more\nenlightened than his own, or those of anyone who sought with both heart\nand mind, using Nature and experience as a guide?\n\nIt was all so obvious and clear; how could anyone not see it?  Yet now\nhe, Olaf Augustine Brunner, must take this lesson and apply it to that\nUniverse, often cold and unreasoning, OUT THERE.  He did not know if he\nwas equal to the task.  He only knew that he must try.\n\nHis mind and confidence thus piqued, he turned back to the poems\nwritten earlier, hoping, perhaps, to find some further sign of his own\nunderstanding---something to set against the huge, dark uncertainty\nbeyond his window.  There were the two from the previous night, as well\nas the poem to his wife.\n\n\n\n\nNIGHT\n\n                Sipping sadness, from the young girl\n                So afraid to go unnoticed\n\n                Young man, stalking forests in his dreams\n                Heightens all his senses\n                        to you.\n\n                Madman, racing knives across a windstorm\n                Searching\n                        For the blood that he will spill.\n\n..................\n\nEVIL\n\n                Rising slowly\n                        hideous figure\n                                cast aside\n                Black with bitter\n                        twisted passions\n                                seeking only\n\n                The murder of a child.\n\n............................\n\nAnd the last, to his wife:\n\n\nPLIGHTED TROTH\n\n                Ara\n                What is my life without you?\n                To be your knight\n                        to fight for you\n                Is all that holds my will together\n                Unraveled, and dispossessed\n                        by Distance, time and empty suffering\n\n                Now you are taken from me,\n                One comfort only can I find:\n                That I loved you then, not less than now\n                And thanked dear Heaven\n                        you were mine.\n\n............................\n\n\nA year, a month, a day ago he might have cried; but this was not the\ntime.  Emotion and sentiment would not bring her back to him, nor would\ndashing his heart upon the rocks.  The mind was the stronger instrument\nnow, a bit cold, but maybe that was best.  He gave it free rein to\npursue its ends.\n\nThe poems showed him that indeed, both elements, love and hatred,\nyielding and aggression, lived inside him.  And both were needed.\nHadn't he felt them?  Hadn't their constant battle for use and mastery\ntormented him?  Yes!  That was what had made him so miserable.  Fool!\nIt was simply (or merely) a question of knowing which to listen to at a\ngiven moment---exerting supreme effort when called for, and having\nenough faith in God, or life, to accept the consequences of what was\nbeyond human will to affect.  Faith and disillusion, professed as\ndifferent creeds, were one and the same, either half without the other\nlike a man trying to stand on one leg.\n\nWith that he became calm again, knowing he must save his strength.\nLater that night he lit the candle and set it beside the picture of his\nwife, and prayed a short, fervent prayer to Whom he did not know.  His\nown image was no longer important.  He vowed to find his wife, however\nlong it took, and to do what he could in the war, though he detested\nviolence and a part of his prayer was that it would soon end.\n\nThe next day, the second of his confinement, passed without serious\n(personal) incident.  That night he took one of the lozenges, knowing\nhe would be unable to sleep without it.  For the Morannon system,\ncode-named Dracus by the Belgians, would be reached the following day,\nand they no longer moved in secret.  The Alliance, apparently piercing\ntheir detection shields, had detached a fighter-destroyer group to\nintercept them.  As near as anyone could tell, battle would be joined\nsomewhere within the system itself.\n\nIn the morning he rose, and reported to the bridge, and with a hard\nbitter determination that grew out of and suppressed his anxiety,\nprepared himself for the fight.  Because for all his introspection and\nself-doubt, there was another side of him, as yet only half realized.\n\nNot for nothing had Dubcek made him his pupil; and not for nothing was\nhe second officer to Mandlik.  His military and psychological testing\nhad revealed that whatever other characteristics he might possess, when\ncornered and left no option, he responded with a resourcefulness and\ntenacity that were almost off the scale.  This fact was so striking in\none of his (outwardly) skittish nature, that more than one of the\nmilitary leaders who reviewed it (including Dubcek) went back to the\nexamining psychologist to ask for an explanation.\n\nThe psychologist had told them simply, \"It's no mistake.  In ordinary\ncircumstances he is much like Hamlet---wavering, indecisive,\nintrospective to a fault.  But when pushed to the final need, somehow\nhe raises himself to another level, and reacts with a courage and\ncunning that are. . .remarkable.\"\n\nAnd that was well, because the fight came, hard and long, and in it the\nupper bridge was wracked by internal explosion, killing Mandlik and\nhalf his officers.  Without the Soviet cruiser, which the Belgian-Swiss\nhad not detected, the battle would almost certainly have gone against\nthem.\n        Brunner's first order, upon assuming command, was to stay near,\nand protect the planet's prison complex, which in their late\ndesperation he feared the Alliance commanders might try to destroy.\n        And he was right.\n\n\n\n*                        *                        *\n\n\n\nThe browning, grapple wrist, raised stiffly before him like a manikin,\nor a marionette, preceded the old man from the chamber.  The entire\nbody moved with it in stiff, convulsive strides, out onto the porch of\nthe Parthenon, between the pillars and onto the marble steps.\n\nOne not of that place might have been shocked by his appearance,\ndistorted as it was by bony growths, the jaw torn to one side by a\nmadman's rock.  Some half-buried sense had drawn him---sight it might\nbe called---to stand there and watch the night sky.\n\nDistant lightnings played before his eyes, soft bursts of light and\nalmost, a pool fancied, distant sounds.  Perhaps Mars had come at last,\nto liberate and destroy them.  Through the dull horror of his\nmarrowmind, twisted like the frame, he recalled verses from a book long\nago, that set his knife-tattered soul on edge.\n\n\nFrom Olympus mighty thunderbolts rain down\nAs futile, Titans reach to steal the crown\nOf He whose strength and glory forged the lands\nFor greater power, rests within His hands.\n\n\n\n        His broken mouth produced a strange, pitiful utterance, as an\nunbearable anguish of hope came over him.\n\n\n*                        *                        *\n\n\n\nAs the last Alliance vessels retreated, or were caught and subdued by\nthe tractor beams of the Leningrad, Brunner's thoughts returned quickly\nto the planet below.  Though his battle fury was still running\nhot---his own vessel was badly damaged, and there were wounded to look\nafter---his mind would think of nothing else.  He started to assign\ndamage and medical crews, but found the work was already being done.\nAnd their primary mission was, in fact, the release and rescue of the\nprisoners.\n\nBut with the main bridge knocked out and the lower malfunctioning, he\ncould gather no news of the inhabitants of the prison-domes on the\nplanet's surface.  \"Getting very confused readings,\" his scanning\nofficer told him.\n\n\"Signs of life?\"  A momentary panic.\n\n\"Yes, Lieutenant, but they cannot be right.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, Intelligence reports over two million inhabitants were\nshipped here, and the internal structures are certainly large enough to\nhouse that number.  But I register less than two hundred life-forms.\"\n\n\"WHAT?\"\n\n\"It's got to be the equipment, sir:  they don't even register as human.\n The calcium content is much too high.\"  Even as he spoke the console\nwent dead with a smell of burned fiber and sparks.\n\n\"Communications Officer.\"  He could not remember her name.  \"Have you\ncontacted Colonel Joyce?\"\n\n\"Yes,  Lieutenant.  The viewscreens are out, but we still have audio.\"\n\n\"Very well.  Put me through.\"\n\nShe handed him a headset.\n\n\"Colonel Joyce.  Brunner.  Do you still intend to call for Soviet\nreinforcements?\"\n\n\"They are on the way.\"\n\n\"Will they be here soon enough to secure the area?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And will you provide transports for the prisoners?\"\n\n\"That will not.....  One thing at a time, Olaf.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?  Those people have been separated from their\nfamilies for months.  What the hell are you waiting for?\"\n\n...  \"Is your scanning equipment working?\"\n\n\"No, the upper bridge was destroyed.  That's why I contacted you.\"\n\n\"And Mandlik?\"\n\n\"Dead.\"\n\n\"You have assumed command?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I think you should organize a landing party and come to the\nLeningrad.  Have you an operational shuttle?\"  Brunner turned to one of\nhis officers, who nodded.\n\n\"Yes.  For God's sake, what is happening?\"\n\n\"I will tell you when you come.\"\n\n\"Sergei.  My wife.....\"\n\n\"Not like this.  Gather your party and come.\"\n\nBrunner ordered the landing party assembled, and met it at the shuttle\ndock.  Among those he found there was the nurse, the only medical\npersona that could be spared, whom he had been so aware of two days\nbefore.  He tried not to look at her.  With a knotting throat and a\nrising anxiety he could not contain, he guided the ship himself into\nthe open receiving dock of the Leningrad.\n\nOne other shuttle craft entered behind them, landing also on the dull\nwhite metal floor, but no more.  The bay doors were closed slowly and\nthe dock began to repressurize.  But in his drunken state the very\nsound of it was like her name hissed by witches.\n\nAs a double-line of Soviet personnel---in breathing suits and\narmed---emerged from an opened passage and made their way to the two\nlarge landing vessels, one of them a hospital ship, he opened the hatch\nof his own vehicle and moved weakly down the steps.\n\nColonel Joyce approached him with another, as if for support.  Brunner\nrecognized him from an earlier visit---Chief Scientist Stoltzyn.  He\nhad no patience left.\n\n\"Why only two Coalition parties?  Didn't you contact the other ships?\"\n\n\"Two will be enough. . .to represent your peoples.\"\n\n\"Represent?  What the HELL IS GOING ON?\"  Some of the Soviet\ntechnicians within the enclosure---there were perhaps two dozen,\nwheeling in odd gear, among its contents special breathing masks for\nthe Czechs---looked over in surprise to hear a Soviet Colonel addressed\nin this way.\n\nBut none were more taken back than Joyce himself.  He seemed unable to\nlook Brunner in the eye or speak the words he had to speak, a thing\nwhich he had never experienced.  Finally it was Stoltzyn who spoke.\n\n\"There's been some kind of plague.\"\n\nBrunner felt his heart heave, then fall in upon itself like collapsing\nleprous flesh.  His voice a fainting whisper.\n\n\"What?  Sergei?\"\n\nJoyce finally master himself and spoke, though slowly.  \"Of the two\nmillion inhabitants, perhaps two hundred still live.  Five of the six\ndomes are emptied of life.  You will be going to the sixth.  But I. .\n.want you to be prepared.\"\n\n\"Tell me.\"\n\nJoyce strode back and forth a few times, irritated, agitated, then\nfaced Brunner almost angrily.\n\n\"Stoltzyn will tell you the rest.  I am sorry, Olaf.  I can say no\nmore.\"  He turned and left the enclosure.\n\nThe chief scientist was more composed.  \"There will be many corpses.\nAlso, those who still live may be gruesome to look upon, and almost\ncertainly will not be rational.  Something in the atmosphere has caused\nthe rapid growth and multiplication of bone cells and calcium\ndeposits.....\"\n\nStoltzyn would have continued but the young German lieutenant had lost\nconsciousness and slithered to the floor.\n\nWhen Brunner came to he found the nurse, the one he did not wish to\nthink about, looking into his face full of concern.  All this took only\na short time, so that as she and another helped him to his feet, the\nSoviet and Czech chief scientists (the latter with considerably less\ndetachment) had only begun to discuss the dangers and consequences of\nsuch a landing.\n\n\"No,\" said the Russian.  \"There is no threat of contagion or epidemic.\nIt is not a disease we are dealing with but a bodily reaction to impure\natmosphere.  We are safe so long as we retain the breathing gear, and\nprobably without it for short periods, though we will not take that\nchance.\"\n\n\"And if the survivors are mad and beyond healing, as you suggest?  What\ndo we do then?\"\n\n\"That is the purpose of this expedition---to determine.\"\n\n\"Do the others know?\"  The Czech made a gesture with his head and left\nshoulder, taking in the other shuttle but implying all the remaining\nCoalition forces.\n\n\"They know what their equipment has told them, and will be briefed by\nthe rest of us as soon as we know ourselves.  Lieutenant Brunner, if\nyou are unwell perhaps you should remain behind.\"\n\n\"His wife may be down there, you idiot.\"\n\n...  \"I am sorry, Brunner, I did not know.  Please don't think me\ncruel.  It is not the first time such a thing has happened, and we may\nhave a very difficult decision to make.  Democratic German\nrepresentation will also be needed---\"\n\n\"Why didn't the domes protect them?\" he said in a savage whisper.\n\n\"I believe they were meant to.  Apparently they were breached.  That is\nall I can say now.  Please outfit yourselves accordingly and come to\nthe first landing vessel when you are ready.\"\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe two landing craft emerged from the whiteness of the Soviet vessel\ninto the blackness of Space, then shortly again into the curved\ndaylight of the desolate planet, reflecting back in a brown haze of\nimpure atmosphere its yellow sun.\n\nThe domes drew nearer---six humps of clearish white spread unevenly\nacross the flat desert floor, standing up from it like supported\nblisters of the planet itself.\n\nBut the blisters had been pierced.  Fissure-holes and cracks, some\nlarger, some smaller, were spread across them.  The land too, upon\ncloser inspection, was pocked with craters, and littered with ugly\nshapes of pocked and polished iron.\n\n\"Meteors,\" muttered a voice.  Brunner turned to see Second Lieutenant\nShellenback seated behind him, head hunched and eyes close, chewing\nmournfully at his hands, remembered vaguely that he was not the only\nGerman to have come looking for family.  The faces of the Czech flyers\nwere grave as well.  Yes---he was not alone in his plight.  Yet there\nwas little comfort in the fact.\n\n\"Why weren't the domes protected?\" came an angry voice.  But even as\nhis mind registered the sound, Brunner saw the huge black tower that\nstood amidst the growing bubbles, the meteor-repulse cannon at the top\nof it.  Stoltzyn, who stood near the front of the windowed fuselage\nlike a stewardess, responded.\n\n\"They were, but insufficiently.  The Alliance must have assumed that\nthe meteors that speckle the surface had arrived singly or in small\ngroups, which is not the case.  Apparently they knew very little about\nthe planet before choosing it as a prison site, since it is also prone\nto violent earthquakes.\"  He went on to explain some phenomenon that\noccurred there every twelve years, something to do with the planet's\nduel orb, coming into line and affecting the magnetic field.....\n\nBut it hardly mattered.  Nothing mattered.  His wife was dead and a\nstrange voice inside him told him he was glad.  This slow awakening of\nall the wrong sentiments was too painful so he shut it off, closing his\neyes and waiting sickly for the ship to land.\n\nThere was a slight delay while the craft relayed back exact\nmeasurements, and waited for the Leningrad to punch a safe and adequate\nhole in the final dome.  For some reason it bore only smallish cracks\nin one or two places near the bottom.  Then the ship passed through and\nset down in the midst of a courtyard or wide street.\n\nThen the ship passed through and set down in the midst of a courtyard\nor wide street.  Brunner opened his eyes.  Stoltzyn was standing before\nthem as before, giving final instructions as the Soviet crew members\nexamined the breathing gear of the others.  Brunner shook off the\nprivate who leaned over him, but the man persisted until the facemask\nwas tested and in place.  Just as the hatch was opened Stoltzyn\nremembered something and began to explain what the plastic pouches set\nat the chin were for.  But this seemed to upset one of the Czechs\nbecause he pushed him aside and sprang down the steps.\n\nBrunner was one of the last to exit, feeling numb and at the same time\ntorn to pieces.  Clearing the final step he became aware that here and\nthere in the street suited men---they must be of the landing\nparty---were doubled over on their knees, holding their stomachs.  He\nsupposed this did not surprise him except that among those kneeling and\nright in front of him was the Soviet chief scientist, who had torn\naside the mask and kept repeating to no one in particular,\n\n\"How could this happen?\"\n\nThe East German raised his eyes to look around them.  Yes, there were\nmany corpses, quite hideous.  Most were facing downward with spines\nthat looked like dinosaurs, but there were those who faced upwards as\nwell.  It was all gruesome enough, the skulls and chests swollen and\ndistorted, the skin stretched thin and pink to accommodate, or\npunctured outright by bony growths, all mottled, discolored, in various\nstages of decomposition.  Eyes mashed and half hidden.  Horrible.\n\nBut Brunner felt in that moment that nothing could hurt him because he\nwas already dead.  Sunk this deep into the nightmare without waking why\nshould he care?  The thought came dully that his mind and heart were\nlike the flesh and organs of the diseased:  crushed and cut by flat or\njagged bone, until they simply surrendered and died.\n\n\"The peace that surpasseth all understanding.\"\n\nBut the black humor of despair could not last.  Movement on a side\nstreet---was there a sound as well?---drew his eyes from the dead and\nback to the living.  The dead had not been able to rouse any feeling of\ntrue pity inside him.  At least their suffering was over.  But to see\nthe twisted and bulging figures walk in flesh.....\n\nTwo bodies stood there that had not yet surrendered.  One of them must\nat one time have been a woman:  long dark hair straggled from the dried\nblood of a knotted forehead---\n\n\nLONG DARK HAIR.  Like a thunderclap the reason for his journey came\nback to him.  Where was his wife?  Was Ara here?  Dear God!  Dear God!\nShe had often worn such a coverall.\n\nHe started toward the street between the buildings.  But the female\ngave an almost-shriek and the two pogoshuffled pitifully away.\n\nHe felt something grasp his arm.  He turned in fear and involuntary\nloathing, but it was only the nurse (the one he did not wish to think\nabout).  She was crying and shaking like a leaf.  She was not what\nnarrow men might call pretty. . .but to see her there with her hair and\neyes and skin unblemished was like water at a last dying need.  A\nbreath of the free air beyond that place came back to him, and with it,\nlike a sob, a final desperate hope of courage and the need to act.\n\nHe remembered they were wearing masks; how would they.....  But seeing\nthe hoop at her ear brought it back.  He embraced her quickly and said\nthrough the microphone.  \"I am searching for my wife.  Will you help\nme?\"\n\nShe nodded rapidly and clung to his arm.  They began to move.  Some\nmember of the party called to them but they walked slowly down the\nstreet toward a large square, where a whitestone marble building at the\nfarther end was built like the Parthenon Library at Athena.  Why it had\nbeen built and by whom (by the Alliance, to show their humane and\nconsiderate treatment of the prisoners) he did not know or care.  If it\nwas also a library then perhaps there would be records.  It was a\nfeeble thought, but it drew him on because he had no other.\n\nAs his heart pounded unbearably he heard the same prayer repeated over\nand over inside him.  DEAR GOD FORGIVE ME I KNOW I AM SELFISH BUT\nPLEASE DEAR GOOD PLEASE IF I MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU DON'T LET HER BE\nHERE.  I WILL DO ANYTHING JUST DON'T LET HER BE HERE.  Then almost\nagainst his will the post script, BUT IF SHE IS HERE MAY SHE PLEASE\nPLEASE PLEASE NOT HAVE BEEN TORTURED AND AT LEAST BE DEAD NOW.\n\n\"No, no!\"  Almost he started to run, but the weight at his arm checked\nhim fiercely.  The girl stood still with terror in her eyes, and\npointed to a figure at the top of the marble steps.\n\nAn old man with graying hair, not so horrible as the rest but still\ndreadful to look upon, stood by another who lay sprawled at his feet on\nthe steps.  Something red stood out clearly against the marble and\nBrunner saw that it was blood, coming from an open wound in the\nprostrate man.  There was blood also on the knife the old man clutched\nawkwardly in his left hand.  If the two had still been human, the scene\nmight have been tragic---something from the epics of Homer.  But as it\nwas it was ghastly and brutal, the afterglow of a vicious reptilian\ndeath struggle.  The standing man's jaw was torn to one side, exposing\nteeth the size of walnuts.\n\nThe woman would have fled, but Brunner watched the old man intently.\nHe saw the weapon in the hand of the other as well---it had not been\noutright murder.  And also the man did not run, but returned his gaze\nwith troubled curiosity.  At last some form of recognition seemed to\ncome over him, because with a twisting gesture of the right arm which\nhe could not lower, he beckoned them towards him.\n\n\"Come on,\" he said to the nurse.\n\nShe shook her head.  \"Make him drop the knife.\"\n\n\"All right.\"  He lowered his mask.  \"My friend. . .we mean you no harm.\n As a gesture that you don't either, will you drop the knife?\"  The\nother looked puzzled.  \"Will you please drop the knife?\"\n\nAt this he seemed to understand.  He shook the arm with the knife in\nit, but would not let it go.        \"Why doesn't he drop it?\"\n\nBrunner advance slowly.  \"He can't.  The bones have fused around it.\"\n\nShe came reluctantly behind and they made a semi-circle past the body,\nand stood at a small distance from him on the unshaded portion of the\nterrace.\n\n\"I would like to check your records,\" said the German slowly, pointing\nto the entrance.  But at this the other's manner seemed to grow\nhostile.  Brunner took a step toward the high door, and then was\ncertain.  The old man tried to cut them off, waving the arm with the\nknife.  A terrible conflict of doubt seemed to be taking place inside\nhim, as if in his ravaged mind he could not seize upon the memory he\nsought.  Brunner walked slowly back into the sunlight.  Something had\nto be done.\n\n\"Stay here,\" he said to the nurse.  \"I've got to talk to him.\"\n\n\"NO!  Be careful.\"\n\nHe approached slowly, and the creature did not draw away.  He drew very\nclose.  Then for all the pain it cost him, and the torment of his soul,\nBrunner put a hand on his shoulder, and looked him full in the face.\nHe was certain.  The old man wished them no harm, but was trying\ndesperately to remember some last purpose he clung to.\n\n\"My friend,\" he said gently, cursing himself again for his weakness and\ntears.  \"I am trying to find my wife.....  I have to know if she was\nhere.  May I please go inside and check your records?\"\n\nHis words were only half understood; the greater impact was made by the\npassion in his tearing eyes.  A cloud seemed to lift from the old man's\nmind, and in some last pool of consciousness he remembered.  He was a\nlibrarian.  Guarding to the last the books and documents entrusted.....\n In case anyone came. . .to search for proofs.....  Of the Holocaust.\nA gleam of something enduring and undefeatable came into his\nhalf-buried eye.  This man was not deformed.\n\nHe raised his head and arms above the elbow in a gesture almost of\ntriumph, and his throat made a sobbing sound.....  As Brunner stepped\nback the man made a pushing motion with the forefinger of his right\nhand, then moved the head forward as if to study the place he had\nfingered.  He repeated the gesture, then turned to face the doors.\n\n\"What's he saying?\"  The nurse.\n\n\"There's a computer terminal inside.\"  Again Brunner felt his heart\npump wildly.  He took the girl's hand and started for the door, yet\nagain the old man cut them off.\n\nBut there was no longer fear of War in his eyes; he only had one more\nthing he wished to communicate.  He tapped his hip with the knife-arm,\npointed to Brunner, then shook his forearm back toward his chest.\n\nNow it was Olaf who didn't understand.  The woman pointed at the\npellet-pistol, forgotten, at his hip.\n\n\"I think.  He wants you to shoot him.\"  Again the movements of\nconfirmation.  Though this time, if it were possible to interpret such\ngestures, he moved the limbs more slowly, with great sadness.\n\nBrunner unclasped the pistol, and with a shaking hand, pointed it at\nhis chest.  \"Is this what you want?\"  The same gesture.\n\nThe one unbroken eye remained in sunlight, filled with tears that could\nnot escape the well of tortured flesh around it.  A low gurgling noise\nsounded in his throat.  Brunner closed his eyes and shot.\n\nThe body fell partially across the entrance, so that they were obliged\nto move it.  \"This one at least, we bury.\"  The words resounded with\nthe hollowness of hell.  They pushed past the right-hand door, and went\ninside.\n\nAfter a time of searching for light and the terminal, Brunner at last\nsat before the fingerboard and smallish screen, trying to summon forth\nwhat was wanted, praying to the point of distraction for his wife, and\nfor himself.  He had asked the nurse to be alone for a time and she\nconsented, was off looking elsewhere for any hard-copy documents that\nmight be useful.\n\nThe man knew enough about computers to read the instruction codes and\nkey out the information wanted, but the terminal kept fighting him.\nSeveral times he had entered, OCCUPATIONAL RECORDS OF RELOCATED\nPERSONNEL, sub-heading, DEMOCRATIC GERMAN, NON-MILITARY.  But each time\nhe did so the screen would read 'Pending', then flash one line at a\ntime, at a reading pace, a dialogue from the Nuremburg Trials of\n1945-46, and lock up at any attempt to clear it.  He tried to bypass,\nused different keywords, but always the result was the same:  he got\nthe dialogues, or nothing at all.  Close to frenzy he threw off the\nchair and paced wildly back and forth.\n\n\"I know all about the Holocaust and the Nuremburg trials!  They have\nbeen required reading at the Academy for two hundred years!\"  He\ngradually calmed himself, if such words may be used, realizing there\nwas nothing else for it.  He set right the chair and keyed in the\ninitial combination, only wishing that he could strap himself in place,\ndenied all movement and all choice.  The screen began again its silent\ndissertation, waiting after each six lines for him to verbally\nacknowledge.\n\nOlaf Brunner read the following, trying to suppress the gasoline in his\nveins, the endless ache of his affliction, and the unnatural swelling\nof the diaphragm that made it difficult to remain still and digest the\nexcrement before him.\n\n\n\nCOL. AMEN:  You speak English pretty well.\n\nVON RIBBENTROP:  I spoke it well in the past and I think I speak it\npassably well today.\n\nCol. Amen:  Almost as well as you speak German?\n\nVON RIBBENTROP:  No, I would not say that, but in the past I spoke it\nnearly as well as German, although I have naturally forgotten a great\ndeal in the course of the years and now it is more difficult for me.\n\nCOL. AMEN:  Do you know what is meant by a 'yes man' in English?\n\nVON RIBBENTROP:  A 'yes man'---per se.  A man who says yes even when he\nhimself.....  It is somewhat difficult to define.  In any case I do not\nknow what you mean by it in English.  In German I should define him as\na man who obeys orders and is obedient and loyal.\n\nCOL AMEN:  As a matter of fact, you were a 'yes man' for Hitler, isn't\nthat correct?\n\nVON RIBBENTROP:  I was always loyal to Hitler, carried through his\norders, differed frequently in opinion from him, repeatedly tendered my\nresignation.  But when Hitler gave an order, I always carried out his\ninstructions in accordance with the principles of our authoritarian\nstate.\n\n\n\n        At the conclusion of this there was a pause, then the following.\n\n\n\nVON RIBBENTROP:  Without ever taking any steps or doing anything myself\nin the SS, yes, that is correct.\n\nSIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE:  Just look.  It is a document.....GB-294.  The\ncorrespondence is 744B.  That is your application with all the\nparticulars.  I just want to ask you one or two things about it.  You\nasked to join, did you not, the 'Totemkopf', the Death's-Head division\nof the SS?\n\nVON RIBBENTROP:  No, that cannot be true.\n\nSIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE:  Don't you remember getting a special\nDeath's-Head ring and dagger from Hitler for your services?  Don't you?\n\nVON RIBBENTROP:  No, I do not remember.  I never belonged to a\nDeath's-Head Division.\n\nSIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE:  And the ring, too.  Here is a letter dated the\n5 November 1935, to the Personnel Office of the Reichsfurher-SS:  \"In\nreply to your question, I have to inform you that Brigadefurher von\nRibbentrop's ring size is 17.....\"  Do you remember getting that?\n\nVON RIBBENTROP:  .....I do not remember precisely.  No doubt it is true.\n\n\n\n\nAnd that was all.  The screen then showed an old and dusting black and\nwhite photograph, with letters in white across the bottom:\n\n\nA MOTHER AND CHILD EXECUTED IN THE UKRAINE\n\n\nThe computer waited for him to acknowledge, but the young East German\nstood mute.  Twenty times that day he had thought he could be brought\nno lower.  And yet the picture froze his heart.\n\nThe woman, dark-haired and young, stood clutching her child in the\nattitude of a protective Madonna.  But for the field, the German\nsoldier, and the mother and child, there was nothing to be seen.  A\nmoment frozen in time.  The soldier, legs spread and planted in perfect\nfiring form, without the slightest sign of hesitation, had aimed his\nrifle and fired at her head.  He must have fired because the woman's\nbare feet were lifted an inch or two above the ground.  The woman still\nshielded the tiny child.....  Apparently he had opted not to try to\nkill them both with a single bullet, though it might have been done\nwith a shot through her back.  This way was surer.\n\nBrunner looked closer.  Was there a hint of doubt in the soldier's\nface?  No.  He had only closed his eyes in reflex to the gun's recoil.\nEquivocation, splitting hairs.  It didn't matter in the least.  The\nterror and death of the innocents were the same.\n\nHe began to feel sick again, and his task was not yet completed.\n\"Acknowledge,\" he said, almost swooning.  The terminal read clearly:\n\n\nDEMOCRATIC GERMAN NON-MILITARY PERSONNEL\n\nEnter\n\n\nThere was no horror left inside him, and yet still the prayer was\nheard, repeating its endless cadence.  NOT HER, OR IF IT MUST BE HER\nTHAT SOMEHOW SHE DIED QUICKLY.  NO PLEASE, TAKE ME INSTEAD.  Till in\nhis delirium he spoke to the soldier, and pleaded with him not to shoot.\n\nHe had to hold one hand with the other to make it work, but on his\nthird attempt punched in correctly:  Ara Heidi Brunner, DOB 12/10/89.\nThe networked computers responded.\n\n\n                                Brunner, Ara Heidi-  12/10/89\n\n\n                                CC#:                320-557-877-666\n                                Sex:                Female\n                                Eyes:                Blue\n                                Hair:                Black\n                                Height:        5'6\"\n                                Weight:        110 lbs\n\n\n                Born Badenberg JCFv Schiller Educated Berlin University\n                Masters Degree Environmental Science Married Olaf\n                Augustine Brunner 6/20/10 Residence Black Forest\n                Province Currently Assigned NorthWest Geological\n                Title Agricultural Technician Current Status  *\n\n\n\nHaving thus filled the display box the lighted asterisk began to flash,\nwaiting for the signal to advance.  Here Brunner hesitated, as his lips\ntried to mumble some words.\n\n\"You have to be alive, I won't let you.\"  Or was it, \"Our father full\nof grace if I mean anything to you dear God if my efforts mean\nanything.\"\n\nHe pushed the continuity icon.\n\n\n\n                Detained Non-Essential Personnel Designated Prison\n                Planet Dracus IIa Late Change Retained Under Order\n                Gen. (Classified) Current Location (Classified)\n\n\n\nAnd it was indeed his lucky day.  For whether she lived or died, she\nwas not there.\n\n\"Lieutenant,\" came a voice through thick layers.  \"Lieutenant.  I've\nfound a boy and he's unhurt.  I don't know why but he's unhurt.\"\n\nAnd turning, he saw there was in fact a boy, perhaps eleven years old,\nphysically unscathed but for a look of bitter hopelessness in his dark\neyes that went far beyond his years.\n\nIt seemed from the nurse's expression that he should say something so\nhe pronounced, What is your name?\n\n\"Elie.\"  WIESEL, he thought.  SEVEN TIMES CURSED AND SEVEN TIMES\nSEALED.\n\nThen Night fell completely in his soul, and he felt no more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n........................................................................\n..................................\n\n\nACT FOUR\n\nArdennes, Balthazar and Scimitar Sectors\nMonths I through IV\nInternational Year:  2212\n\n\n\nREVERSAL\n\n\nI\n\nThe Chinese colonies, the fences of Dark, endured.  Though pressed to\ntheir last utmost need, many times beyond despair, the Chinese could\nnot be broken.  Help arrived as all courage failed, and the Enemy was\ndriven back.\n\nThe assassination of Stone did not, if that had been its purpose,\nintensify the Constitutional crisis under which the Commonwealth\nlabored.  Its citizens, for the most part, knew Plant to be an\nintelligent and experienced politician.  And if anything, after the\ndisillusioning of recent events, and slow reawakening of the national\nconscience (though still riddled with blind-spots), most felt that\ntheir dilemma now rested in more competent hands.\n\nBut more than that, some intangible quality of the people themselves,\nindefinable, led the Americans at such times of crisis to rally around\ntheir leaders, united and prepared to act.  Ironically, bitterly (to\nthose who still remembered the evils of World War II), this was a\nGerman trait as well.\n\nThe entire military and intelligence-gathering forces of the nation\nwere now mobilized to head off Hayes' disastrous charge, which had left\nsuch horrors in its wake.  For now a full account of the Dracus\nincident had been received, and those with any conscience at all,\nrealized that they had been party to a catastrophe that could never be\nset right, and whose wounds would fully never heal.  And while the\nAmericans were no more eager than any other nation to admit such\natrocities---the slave trade, and the genocide of the Native Americans\nspring to mind---truth IS a naked sword, and its hard won freedom of\nthe press made it impossible to deny.\n        But the rogue (war criminal, psychopath) had not been caught,\nand the Pandora's Box of chaos and violence which he (along with\nothers) had opened, was far from contained.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nSomehow Hayes had kept the fantasy together.  Though there were\nstirrings of discontent among his men, and an ever diminishing number\nwere free of a doubt that bordered on bewilderment, no word of their\ntrue position had yet reached them.  And though the destructive force\nof the Third Fleet had not grown, neither had it sufficiently\ndiminished.  And the wounded predator is by far the most dangerous.\nHayes was desperate.\n\nAfter six months of running, engaging only in minor skirmishes which\ncould hardly be colored as 'the forward lance of democracy', of getting\nhis information only from Hayes, Admiral Frank was tormented by\nuncertainty.  Why was Congress still squabbling?  When would\nreinforcements arrive?  It was clear that the Soviets were astir, and\nwhat was worse, by the look of it were coming directly after them.\n\nBut more troublesome than all of this, to a loyal soldier who did not\nscare easily, was the thought that perhaps Hayes was not telling the\nwhole truth---that they were being used for some scheme of his which\ndid not entirely align with the wishes of the President.\n\nWhy did Hayes continue to deny even the most basic military\ncommunications?  They had had literally no sight or sound of their\nfellow soldiers in five full months.  Granted they fought their battles\nalong the frontiers, where lines of communication were stretched thin,\nand often erased altogether by the time factor.  But to be so totally\nisolated, to feel cut off from one's own compatriots.....\n\nThat it took Frank so long to entertain even these simple doubts,\nshowed just how deep his military training had gone.  As intended, he\nwas no longer an individual, no longer a thinking, questioning being,\nbut merely an instrument, a cog in a runaway machine.  But despite all\nefforts to the contrary, even a cog has a mind.\n\nFinally he could bear it no longer.  He secured an audience with the\nman alone, difficult enough just that, and told him in no uncertain\nterms of the Fleet's need for fuel, repairs, and additional vessels to\nreplace those lost in the fighting.  He had also intended to demand\naccess to direct communications; but the forbidding glare aroused in\nthe hawkish face as he approached the subject, made him back off.\nInsisting on a link-up with one of the American outposts would have to\ncover it.  If something were truly amiss, surely they would find out\nthere.\n\nBut Hayes' cunning was not yet expired.  He had foreseen this.  Already\nhe had his next move planned.\n\n\"Very well, Admiral.  In truth I'd been thinking along the same lines\nmyself.  There are two outposts in Scimitar, are there not?  The nearer\nbeing Westmoreland station, is that correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, General.  Shall I alter our course in that direction?\"\n\n\"By all means.  Only not too straight or too fast.  I want to send a\nDetachment there first to make sure everything is on the level.  The\nRussians have been getting a little too close for comfort, eh?\"  With\nthis his face broke into an unnatural smile.\n\n\"I know, my friend.  This cannot go on much longer:  radio silence,\nlittle or no action on appropriations.  If we don't learn something\nmore useful at Westmoreland, I think we may just head for home.  Maybe\nI can get to the bottom of this myself, rattle a few cages back in\nWashington.  Stone must be beside himself.  Election year or not,\nthey've got no right to play politics with the lives of the Third\nFleet.\"\n\nHe rose, patted Frank on the arm, and started to leave.  Then turning\nin the portal, he added.  \"Sorry if I've been a bit of a dry fist\nlately.  Trying to carry the weight of all this had made me.....  Well,\nyou see how it is.  Do you forgive me?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.  That is. . .there is nothing to forgive.  I was only\nconcerned.....\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. You were concerned for the Fleet, as is your duty, and\nyour character.  You're a good man in a hard place, Donald.  Don't ever\nthink I take your loyalty for granted.  Well.  Enough said.\"  He smiled\nagain the strange half-smile, and disappeared into the corridor.\n\n\n*\n\n\nLike Bonaparte (and other self-appointed monarchs) before him, Hayes\ntoo had his personal Guard, a elite corps of two-thousand pilots and\nfighting men, specially trained and chosen, fearless, loyal to him and\nno other.  This he had been able to create, in the midst of a democracy\nwhich discouraged internal militarism, because of his forty years in\nthe service, most of it spent as a distinguished veteran of high rank\nand favor, his ten years as the only five-star general in the land, and\nfinally, his three years as Secretary of State.  His remaining capacity\nfor harm was not to be underestimated.  His own part in the conspiracy\nto murder Stone was not yet clear, though the twelve officers and\nSecret Service men implicated had all been close associates, or men who\nshared his personal beliefs.\n\nSo he detached his elite unit, consisting almost entirely of Blue Angel\nflyers and Special Forces assault troops, to Westmoreland Station.\nCalder himself was to lead them:  two light cruisers, sixteen\ndestroyers and fighter escort.  He was given the following instructions.\n\n\"When you come within clear tracking range, make contact and identify\nyourself as the 21st Airborne of the Sixth Fleet.  Here are the\ncounter-codes.  Tell them you've been detached to patrol the area.\nDon't say why.\n\n\"Request permission to come aboard to refuel, and to gather the latest\nnews of developments at home.  The station is far enough out that they\nmay not yet have heard of the death of Stone, or the search for the\nThird Fleet.  Ask specifically if there is any message for you from\nGen-Admiral Hesse.  If they act the least bit suspicious at the mention\nof his name, or say he's been arrested, etc., act shocked and ask to\nhear the whole story when you arrive.\n\n\"Continue to advance, and if they raise their shields or become\ndefensive, break down resistance and board.  Try to avoid damaging the\nfuel cylinders, but don't worry about other signs of battle.  We can\nalways blame it on the Russians, and say you drove them back.  Needless\nto say, in that event we can't have any witnesses.\"\n\nCalder had nodded sternly, assembled and given an in-flight briefing\n(no more truthful than necessary) to his forces, and made for\nWestmoreland.\n\nBut Plant was no fool.  The farther outposts were among the first he\ncontacted.  They knew in full (as far as the two month time-delay\npermitted) every aspect of the situation, and were prepared for just\nsuch a move.  Two experienced (and loyal) CIA men had been dispatched\nto Westmoreland.  And when Calder, calling himself Brig. General Adam\nWinslow, established contact and made his pitch, they conferred quickly\nwith the Base Commander, then decided on and executed the following\nplan.\n\nThe commander of Westmoreland 'station', a mere rock of a moon,\nfloating with others of its kind about a semi-gaseous giant similar\nSaturn, responded to his inquiries that they'd had no news of Earth in\nmonths, were glad of the company, and asked, What was the situation\nwith all the Soviet scouting ships about?\n\nUpon hearing this, Calder, who shared Hayes' way of thinking but not\nhis shrewd intelligence, felt that all was well, and that he could\nwrite his own ticket.  But to be certain, he brought his force in\nseveral vessels at a time, to be serviced while he himself went to\nspeak with Col. Billings, the officer in charge, of whom he knew\nvaguely from his years at West Point.\n\nWhile the two discussed Calder's version of recent events, including\nthe fact that he had encountered the Third Fleet not far off, which was\nsaid to be running low on fuel and supplies (Huckleberry Finn in a\ndress had been more convincing), the two Intelligence men set to work.\n\nPosing as members of the ground crew, they implanted small aluminum\ntubes, canisters, on the landing gear of three fighters.  On the\nsynthetic caps which bound them were written these words, superimposed\nover an imprint of the Presidential Seal:\n\n\"You are hereby authorized by the President of the United Commonwealth\nto view these contents in private, and to act upon them as you see\nfit.\"  If these proved ineffective, the two planned to involved\nthemselves more directly when the Third Fleet came in for fuel and\nsupplies.\n\nWord was also sent in all directions that Hayes was in the vicinity,\nand that the Soviets were not far behind.\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nCaptain Olaf Brunner, newly promoted, was scarcely recognizable as the\nsame human being who had once been so unsure of his military role, and\nstood in trepidation at the approach of the Alliance Fleet.\n\nHe had not relinquished command of the Czech destroyer upon coming to\nagain in its infirmary.  Rather, against doctor's orders he had\nremained there for one day only, then thrown himself into his duties\nwith such vehemence that all in the ship became afraid of him, and some\nwondered if the blow to his humanity had not been fatal.\n\nRealizing this, realizing also that the people around him were not to\nblame if his life was ended, he became less harsh in his attitude\ntowards them, and turned the full weight of his broken malice instead\ntoward repairing the ship, notifying next of kin, and getting them all\nback safely into Coalition space, where he intended to request (demand)\na German command of his own.  Though his health had not improved, and\nthough the medicines he once shunned were now habitual, this no longer\nseemed an\nimportant point.  His new-found callousness lent itself even to\nphysical insensitivity.\n\nIn the rare moments he allowed himself to meditate, he thought almost\nexclusively of Dubcek and the tortured old man.  How well he now\nunderstood them both:  Dubcek, upon the death of his wife, throwing\nhimself into his military career, trying to scrape some pitiful meaning\nfrom the ruins of an empty life.  And the librarian, clinging\ndesperately to one last purpose, one last reason to live.\n\nWasn't he doing the same?  Only the thought, cruel as it was, that\nsomehow Ara still lived and still needed him, kept him from ending his\nown life.  Or maybe he was just a coward.....  And one other impulse\ndrove him, foreign as it might have seemed to his nature not so very\nlong before.  He wanted to kill as many of the enemy as possible---just\nKILL them.  The soul was dead inside him.\n\nThe Belgian and Swiss forces, true cowards, made no further appearance\nat Dracus.\n\nEscorted by the increased Soviet contingent, the Czech vessels made\ntheir way slowly out of Cerberus, where they met at length with the\nrefurbished and reunited Coalition forces.\n\nHere in neutral Space they held their parley, and deliberated upon a\nnew course of action.  No longer was any thought given to hiding and\nretreat.  For now the Soviets backed them fully, if having their own\nbattles to fight as well.  Now Hayes was an outcast, and the abashed\nnations that had not come to the aid of Schiller (whether or not it\nwould have made a difference) emptied their outposts for a\ncounter-attack against the Alliance, and if necessary, against Hayes\nhimself.  The murderous horse-crap had gone far enough.\n\nBrunner's temporary promotion was made permanent, and he was given\ncommand of a German destroyer group.  This was partly due to his\ntenacity in liberating Dracus, partly to Dubcek's, and therefore\nItjes', posthumous influence.  And partly because they knew of his\ndesperate search for his wife, and did not undervalue such a motive.\n\nBut if any were concerned about his qualifications and competence, his\nability to handle his personal torment, they need not have worried.\nFor what he lacked in experience, he more than made up for in latent\ndetermination, and at times, utter fearlessness.  Death held literally\nno meaning for him.  And in aggressive, retaliatory war, this could be\na powerful weapon.\n\n\n\n*                        *                        *\n\n\n\nHayes tapped the aluminum canister angrily against the counter-shelf of\nhis quarters, watching the enclosed microvideo play back in its\nentirety the assassinated Stone's July address to Congress, concluded\nby then Vice-President Plant.  Next came footage, along with the New\nYork Press commentary, of the Presidential funeral, and the later trial\nof Admiral Hesse.  This was followed in turn by Plant's exigent\ninauguration, and lastly, by Bacon being sworn in as the new Secretary\nof State, vowing to check the spread of anarchy and military\nadventurism, and bring the traitor Hayes to justice.  Calder stood like\na rueful statue just inside the doorway.\n\n\"Idiot!\" screamed Hayes when all was over.  Calder closed his eyes,\ncrumpled in shame, but the exhortation had not been directed against\nhim alone.  \"Now he's left me no choice.\"  He got up and waved a\nthreatening finger at the other.  \"No choice!\"\n\nIt was not clear whom this 'he' might represent, since Stone was dead\nand buried, and Plant and Bacon two separate beings.  Perhaps it was\nmerely meant in the military sense---the pronoun replacing, both\nverbally and psychologically, that mass of humanity opposed to one's\naims, who therefore must be killed.  The enemy, which in Hayes' mind\ncontinued to multiply all around him.\n\nAt length he became calmer.  \"You're sure there were only two of these\nplanted at Westmoreland?  No mistakes this time.\"  His lackey began to\nanswer, but he interrupted him.  \"Nevermind.  We can't take that for\ngranted.\"\n\nAlmost tearfully.  \"What. . .what will we do  now?\"\n\n\"NOW?\"  What I should have done a long time ago.  I'm not out of aces\nyet!  No sir, not by a damn sight!  Pull yourself together, and report\nback to me at 0450.\"\n\nThe 'ace' that Hayes referred to was simply this, hitherto, and to the\nsane mind still, unthinkable.  He would construct a star gate straight\nto Earth, overthrow Plant and install himself as President,\nsimultaneously  eliminating the Soviet Union from the face of the\nglobe.  Then they would HAVE to rally behind him:  the Fourth and\ndecisive Great War.  The dream wasn't ended, just pressed to its last,\nsupreme effort and need.  His only mistake to date had been that he\nunderestimated the greatness of God!  Ruthless, that was the way of\nHeaven.  The way it must be, by damn!\n\nIf he had been tireless, aggressive and energetic before, that was\nnothing to the way he now threw himself, and his men, into action.\nConstruction of the final Gate was begun immediately, and every vessel\nthat could still fly or fire a shot, along with the Dreadnought itself,\nwas issued to defend it.  Let the red bastards come!  It would take\ntwice his own number to defeat him now.  His men were battle trained\nand battle hardened, and what was more, they were desperate.  (He\ncontinued to find it impossible to separate his own emotions from those\nof his men).\n\nBut. . .ONE THING AT A TIME, AND NOT MISSING A SINGLE DETAIL.  That had\nbeen his motto, and he stuck to it for all the current frenzy.  He\ndetached the mythical '21st Airborne' once more to Westmoreland, this\ntime not to talk, but to fight.\n\nAlong with it, and all in the same vessel, went the ground crews that\nhad serviced and realigned the Detachment upon their return from the\nfirst encounter, including the man who had brought him the two\ncanisters.  These possible witness/subversives must not live to tell\ntheir tale.\n\nHayes no longer cared if the fuel cells were lost.  Who needed them, or\nanyone or anything else?  They would find all the supplies they needed\non Earth.  Enough of this mucking around!  He was going home in bloody\ntriumph, and good-night sweet prince to anyone who stood in his way.\n\nHe decided also, on one of the many sleepless nights spent waiting for\nthe star gate, to tell his men the truth---at least that was how it\nthen appeared in his mind.  YES, OF COURSE.  One thought followed\nanother in rapid succession.\n\nSTONE HAD BEEN MURDERED, BUT NOT BY THE ARCH-CONSERVATIVES.  NO!  BY\nTHE SNAKE'S BELLY LIBERALS.  AND BY THE COMMUNISTS AND THEIR\nSYMPATHIZERS, WHO FEARED THE SWORD HE HAD PUT IN HIS GENERAL'S HAND.\nPLANT WAS A MERE PUPPET.  OF COURSE!  HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO USURP\nHIM, AND DEAL THE AVENGING BLOW TO SOVIET SPACE.  He could even use the\nfootage of Stone's funeral, to commentary written by himself.....\n\nHe dressed quickly, took out of its locked drawer the remaining\nmicrovideo, and made his way impatiently to the InterCommunications\nStudio, where he spent the rest of the night alone, cutting and\nediting, then in a late flurry, recording and polishing his own\naddress.  Age and fatigue tried to rankle, but he was not let them.\nThe Gate was nearly completed and the Russian threat, unseen but\nstrongly felt, grew nearer each day.  Surely by now they had secured a\nlock on his position, and dispatched their Armada.....\n\nThere was no time to lose.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThe Coalition had decided to attack the Belgians and Swiss at the place\nthey were now weakest---the occupied Dutch holdings at Larkspur.  There\nwere several other considerations behind this choice.\n\nFor one thing, it was unexpected.  For another, it placed the field of\nbattle on neutral ground, where if the assault was beaten back, or the\nfighting became intense, there could be no reprisals, or increased\ndanger to the civilian populations.  Lastly, and of no small\nimportance, the Soviets insisted upon it.  Apparently something had\ndeveloped in their search for Hayes and they could not, so they said,\nspare sufficient force to insure victory at the tri-colonies of Athena.\n At least not yet.\n\nAfter their most recent assault against Joint Africa, at the heart of\nthe Kurtz quadrant---the one that had triggered, or at least\nlegitimized the Soviet response---the Alliance had drawn themselves\ninto a more defensive posture.  But they were still, by all\nreconnaissance, overextended.  Their expected help from the German\nStates, both in weapons systems and personnel, had not materialized,\nand upon last contact with Hayes, himself now a renegade, he had told\nthem flatly to, \"Go play soldier in a barn.\"\n\nAt the outset of the conflict, the relative strengths of the Alliance\nand the Coalition had been approximately equal.  After the Schiller\ndebacle and concurrent destruction of the Coalition First Combat Fleet,\nthe scales had for a time been heavily tipped in favor of the Belgians\nand Swiss.  But with Soviet Space now backing their rival, the\n(legitimate) American forces now hostile because of Hayes' earlier\ncomplicity with them, and the German States coolly indifferent, they\nfound themselves in a position where not only was offense impossible,\nbut defense became equally precarious.  The overall anarchy which they\nhad counted on to cover their tracks, was now on the wane, as United\nNations peace-keeping forces---mostly Japanese, British and Australian,\nalong with the implicit aid and cooperation of the Commonwealth---were\ndispatched to patrol the troubled areas.\n\nThe prowling leopard was caught in its tree, alone, surrounded by foes.\n\nBut a treed cat is far from a dead one.  Teeth and claws and sinew it\nstill possessed, along with the added ferocity of desperation.  And not\nall of those on the ground below it were unified, or come with the same\npurpose.\n\nThe fight was far from over.\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nFor all his medicines and reckless determination, by the time the\nCoalition/Soviet fleet came within striking distance of Dutch Larkspur,\nCaptain Brunner was a physical and psychological time-bomb.\n\nHe knew this, did not know how to change it, and for all his efforts at\ncallousness, could not keep creeping fears from sprouting in his mind.\nHe was like a man on a tight-rope through dense fogs of desolation.\nDid hope lie forward, or back?  It might have been easy but for\nthoughts of Ara that still came to him in his despair.  If only she\nwould come and kneel beside his deathbed, kiss his brow and say it was\nall right.  Then he could surrender his spirit and be at peace.  But\nshe did not come, and because of it, the tiniest part of him still held\non.\n\nFour days out from Dutch Rembrandt/van Gogh, his mind and body together\nreached an impasse.  His intestines throbbed with a dull ache that\npervaded all with weakness and chills.  The sleep lozenges he counted\non to end the horror of each day had begun to show side-effects, and he\ncould hardly take one in mid-afternoon.  So he struggled on, eyes\nwincing yellow weakness as he stirred uncomfortably in his Group\nLeader's chair, amid the upper bridge of the first destroyer.  Whatever\nthat might mean.  Until a surge of liquid anguish overpowered him, and\nhe knew he could not go on.\n\nSo that was the way of it.  At the bitter last his pride was broken,\nand his will rendered useless.\n\nHe got up from the chair, leaning one arm heavily on the padded rest,\nand waited for the tiny squares to pass from before his eyes.  Then\nmumbled something to his exec about IN MY QUARTERS, CALL ME IF THERE IS\nANY NEED.  And turned and walked weakly, sweatily from the enclosure.\n\nAs he made his way down the long corridor to the elevator leading\ndownwards, he tried dully to reckon the number of lozenges it would\ntake to end his life.  He had perhaps fifteen.  That would have to\ncover it. . .only. . . the convulsions would be unpleasant if he\nfailed.  He stepped into the wide double cylinder, mumbled \"Six,\" and\nfelt the world fall away beneath him.\n\nThat he was not thinking clearly he knew.  That his death was at hand\nhe also knew, but could not make the words form into any kind of\nmeaningful pattern in his mind.  All was dark, blank, and\nunintelligible.  Not the slightest emotion stirred inside him.\nStepping once more into a formless corridor, he walked past floating\ngray shapes he imagined must be men, and came to the portal of his\nlatest hell.  The door opened silently before him.\n\nLooking into room he saw upon his dresser the vial, the photograph, and\nthe nearly empty glass of water.  He studied the trinity for a time\nbefore entering.  Almost it would have seemed poetic, something from\nthe epics.....  \nComing closer he looked first at the one, then at the other, then back\nagain.  To the photograph. . .of his lover.  Why was she so damned\nbeautiful?  Even now.\n\nThrough countless layers of dust, his heart throbbed a single pang of\npain and remorse, causing in its turn the irritation of a parched\ncorner of one eye.  From some unseen source, where he had been sure\nthat no moisture lay, there came a gurgling bubble of mud, followed by\na tiny flow of water.  A desert spring in the midst of choking sands.\nHe lifted the frame, brought it gently, then crushed it to his chest,\nand let out a sob of life that told him he could not yet die.\n\nHe drank the water in the glass, down to the bitter and confused\nsediment.  Then with tears, real tears in his eyes, he heard as if from\nfar below the ground his own voice, set loose this utterance.\n\n\"I cannot do it.  It is not for me to say when all is lost.  Dear God,\nplease help me hold on.\"\n\nHe set down the empty glass, looked around him, tried to think.  Then\nmade his way to the Infirmary.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe new doctor examined him thoroughly, including a scope of his\nintestines that the first had considered unnecessary.  He sighed to\nhimself as he studied the computer screen.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Brunner impatiently.\n\n\"You no doubt had an intestinal virus, but that only exacerbated the\nmore serious problem.\"\n\n\"Which is?\"\n\n...  \"Crohn's disease.\"\n\n\"What?  What is that?\"\n\n\"An inflammation of the intestines:  similar to arthritis, and that the\nbody incorrectly identifies a part of itself as an alien invader, and\nsends out anti-bodies to attack it.\n\nBrunner felt the breath catch at his throat.  \"Am I going to die?\"\n\nThe doctor shook his head firmly.  \"No.  The disease, though incurable,\nneed not be fatal.  There are some fairly effective medicines, and at\nfinal need, surgery.  But until we can reduce the swelling, you must\navoid all further stress.\"\n\nHe started to reply that this was impossible, but checked himself,\nfighting off his fears at the unknown malady, and trying to reverse the\nnegative mind-set in which he found himself immersed.  Somehow he must\nfind a way.  If not for himself, then for Ara.\n\nBeing Commander of a Battle Group was not the same as commanding a\nsingle vessel.  The ship had its own captain as well, and he was not\nneeded for day-to-day functions.  So he thanked the doctor, received\nthe new medication and withdrew.\n\nHe gave temporary command to his Executive Officer, saying he would\nreturn in three days---his doctor had advised two weeks---went to his\nquarters and slept, hard as it was, avoiding drugs and self-pity when\npossible.  He spent time in the library reading, or (on his cabin's\nviewscreen) observing quietly and without interference the interaction\nof his staff upon the bridge---learning, letting life take its course\nas it led them into battle.  So effortlessly.\n\nOccasionally he spoke with Joyce, still leader of the Soviet presence,\nthough he detected a new coolness in the Russian's tone and manner,\nwhich increased as they drew nearer their objective.  He thought he had\nan idea what this might mean, but it was not for him to act or pass\njudgment upon.  Four hundred lives were now entrusted to his care, as\nwell as some small part in the eventual overthrow of the Alliance, and\nsubsequent liberation of his home.  He had no illusions about being on\nthe side of good, but only being caught up in the insanity of war---the\npinnacle of man's inhumanity to man.\n\nIf this overthrow and liberation could be accomplished, if she was\nstill there on Athena, he would build his life on new foundations.  If\nonly she was there.\n\nAnd he could survive until then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..............................................\n\n\n\n\n\nHEARTS OF FIRE\n\n\nThe battle of Rembrandt/van Gogh saw the most bitter fighting of the\nentire war.  Even at Schiller, where the Coalition pilots were forced\nto continue a battle they could not win, after perhaps the first three\nhours came the grim realization, the last human outlet, that death\nawaited them.  Here there was no such comfort, nor did the torment end\nafter five hours only.\n\nHere the collision of forces and opposing wills was so even---the\ndetermination of the Coalition fighters to liberate, avenge and\noverthrow, the determination of the Belgians and Swiss to survive, and\nnot be enslaved by the Soviets---that the conviction of the one and the\ndesperation of the other crashed together time and time again without\nany clear result.  And added to the white-hot intensity of their\nstruggle, was the question that for thirty-six hours could not by\neither side be answered:  was victory still possible?\n\nIf one is cold and hard enough to perceive it, he will see that in a\ntruly fatalistic world there is a limit to the terror of the wretched\nsouls caught inside it.  Always death is there as a final end to all.\nBut where death is not an alternative, because hope remains, where the\nquestions:  \"Will I survive?  Can I still live and find peace?  Or is\nmy very struggle in the world of flesh ended forever?\" remain\nunanswered, tipping first one way and then the other on the blind\nscales of Justice, or Fate, or some damnable, unnamable thing.....\nHere, there is horror.\n\nThe world which the existentialists present to us---where all is\nmeaningless, nothing is lasting, and death and mutilation of dreams\ninevitable---was here, as in countless battles of flesh and blood,\nrendered empty and false.  For where is the terror in such a\npredetermined world?  Let the man who sees the black truth, end his\nlife and have done.  As if the multitude of Life and Universe around us\ncould be supported by some trick of cruel gods!\n\nThe true intensity of Man's existence---real, physical,\nundeniable---lies in the fact that success and victory are possible, if\nlike everything else in our finite lives and understanding, limited and\npassing.  Health, happiness and love (in varying degrees, and depending\nlargely on outlook) are too many times evident in those around us to\nmerely to say, THERE IS NO HOPE, THERE IS NO CHANCE, THERE IS NO GOD.\nThe man dying of terminal disease, or imprisoned without hope of escape\nin a living hell not of his own creation, has the right when pain and\nfear become unbearable, to give in to despair.  We have not.  Because\nfor the rest of us, the fact remains that victory and success (if the\ngoal is just, and based on reality) ARE possible, however terrible the\nprice, or the roads which lead to it.\n\nA man is forced to ask himself, as he is borne down the swift water-gap\nof crisis, toward the razor knifing across his path, CAN I SURVIVE THE\nVERY TIP OF THAT BLADE, AND PASS THROUGH?  IS MY RAFT OF FLESH STRONG\nENOUGH, MY SHIELD OF WILL AND UNDERSTANDING SUFFICIENT?  And while\ncaught on that blade, how multiplied the anguish by the fact that his\nhope never leaves him.  \"Hope springs eternal in the human breast.\"\n\nBut even this would not make the struggle so overpowering, if it were a\nfalse hope, and we knew it.  But all around us there is the rumor of\ntriumph (and tragedy), of those who have survived personal hells,\naccomplished the impossible, and stand now on a more permanent footing,\nif only in posterity.  How then can we, caught in the midst of the\nfray, despair, and surrender our dreams?  We cannot.\n\nAge approaches us, inevitable death, suffering that cannot be avoided.\nAnd yet there is also the eternal Spring of youth inside us, that hope,\nthat yearning, if not for peace in this world, then at least for some\nlast accomplishment before release into the great unknown:  some reason\nfor having been here.\n\nFor this Battle is not fiction.  It is not words, nor one man's\nopinion.  It is life:  LIFE, the beautiful and terrible.\n\nHow can a man survive?\n\n\n*\n\n\nOlaf Brunner experienced more physical, emotional, and spiritual\ntorment in those thirty-six hours than he would have thought possible\nfor any man to bear, let alone himself, and in his weakened state.  The\nphysical anguish came from sickness and fatigue, and from the\nintolerable heat upon the wounded bridge, the emotional, from the loss\nof ships and lives that had been given him to protect, and the\nspiritual, from the Godless red carnage that lashed back and forth like\na writhing, bloodied serpent:  the death and mutilation he saw with his\neyes and heard through the earpiece.  And from the Goddamnable and\nagonizing question of whether or not they could still break through.\n\nThe dual colonies having no substantial defense shields or stations\n(those of the Dutch had been destroyed in conquest, and not\nsufficiently rebuilt), the Bel-Swiss had chosen to counter-attack, and\nto make their stand in the open Space around them.  Meanwhile the\nSoviets, epitomizing their policy of conditional help, held their own\nforces back, lending only long-distance firepower in times of greatest\nneed.\n\nAfter the first twenty-four hours, Brunner had realized grimly that his\npoor physical health and personal trauma were no longer a\ndeterrent---that many men with strength and good fortune he did not\npossess, would have faded and given up long before.  And he knew also,\nfor all his introspection, that he BELONGED on that bridge, in that\nfight.  HE WAS NOT A QUITTER OR A LOSER!  Like a savage wolf defending\nits fallen mate he remained there, as rationality slipped farther and\nfarther from sight, till in the end he truly was a wolf, as the hyenas\naround him lunged ravening about the helpless form of his wife, which\nhe alone defended.\n\nAnd this feeling of desperate and unyielding righteousness communicated\nitself not to him alone, or to the men who served under him.  In those\nlate hours all the Coalition felt it, and the more unattainable victory\nseemed, the more bitterly they steeled themselves to attain it.  The\nBelgians and Swiss began to waver, and at last the Soviet battleships\nmoved in.\n\nThe question had finally been answered.  The field of battle and the\nIslands beyond, belonged to those who had wanted them more desperately.\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nWhen the matter was clearly in hand, and those Alliance vessels which\ncould not flee had surrendered, Captain Brunner turned the helm back\nover to his subordinates, placed his destroyer group (what remained of\nit) under the command of Col. Liebenstein, and retired to his quarters.\n Taking a sleeping lozenge he collapsed onto the bed, where his limbs\ntrembled slightly and his eyes moved feebly in their sockets, until it\nbegan to take effect.  Then at last his eyelids closed, and he knew\nnothing more for three hours.\n\nHe was jolted back to life by a young officer tugging urgently at his\narm.  \"Commander Brunner.  Commander.\"\n\nHe rose suddenly and, between the still pronounced effect of the drug\nand the liquid-shock state of his nerves, felt certain that something\nterrible had happened.\n\n\"What?  What is it?\"  The victory of so few hours before seemed not at\nall a sure memory.  \"Have the bastards broken through?\"\n\nThe officer, himself as taut and fatigued as a violin-string on which\nsome mad symphony had been played, had no trouble interpreting his\nwords.  \"No, Commander.  It's your wife.\"\n\nThese words did not at first make any impression on him, since he was\nsure there was some mistake.  If the man had told him that the stars\nhad all turned black, his mind could have accepted it more easily.  But\nslowly his eyes narrowed upon the serious face of the adjutant.\n\n\"Where?\"  He had not the courage to ask in what condition.  And\nbesides, it could not possibly.....\n\n\"At the former headquarters of the Alliance High Command.\"  These words\nnot seeming to make an impression, he added, \"On Rembrandt.  Our envoy\nwent to negotiate terms of surrender.\"\n\n\"Ara Heidi Brunner?\"  He pronounced the words slowly, with rising and\nuncontrollable emotion.  \"You're sure?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  She asked for you specifically, if you would be allowed---\"\n\n\"I've got to go to her!\"  He rose and started for the door, but lost\nhis balance and stumbled down on one knee.  He pushed away the\nadjutant, who was leaning over him.\n\n\"It's the sleeping pill.  Tell the doctor I need a stimulant, and find\nout about a landing craft.\"  He waved his arm vaguely.\n\n\"Colonel Liebenstein has said to meet him aboard the Kythera in half an\nhour.  They will be sending a party to the capitol at that time.\"\n\n\"Have we a functioning shuttle?\"  The deja-vu was almost too powerful.\n\n\"Yes, Commander.\"\n\n\"Go.  Go.\"  The young man left the room as he strained to right himself\nand recover some semblance of calm.  Realizing the latter was\nimpossible, and that the stimulant would make it worse, being so far\nbeyond any choice.....  He sat helpless on the edge of the bed, and\ngave himself up to the Sea which had dashed him so mercilessly, yet now\nwas bearing him, heedless, toward all his desire.  \"If only she is all\nright!\"  His head dipped again beneath the drowning swells, and he\nstruggled for breath.\n\nA medic entered with a syringe and a distracted, irritated look on his\nface.  \"Are you sure this is a good idea?\"  Brunner said nothing,\nrolled up the sleeve and pointed to his upper arm.  Shortly afterward\nthe adjutant returned.  No longer shunning his help, he leaned heavily\nagainst him, and after the first mad adrenalin rush, made his way as in\na three-legged race to the shuttledock.\n\n\"Can you fly a shuttle?\" he asked as they entered.  But seeing a pilot\nalready at the helm, he asked instead, \"Can you be spared from your\nduties?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  If you wish---\"\n\n\"I do.\"  A complex series of emotions, such as only real life can\nprovide, made him not want to be parted from this lad, so very little\nmore than a boy.\n\nThe shuttle made its way to the Kythera, from which her summons had\ncome.  Upon arrival he and the boy boarded the larger landing craft,\nwhich then made for the soft and flowing hues of Dutch Rembrandt.\nBrunner's last rational thought of that voyage was that planets had\nbeen misnamed, since van Gogh at its distance was all of gold and black.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe vessel touched down before the vast, geodesic Headquarters\nbuilding, after first passing through the airlock of the encircling\ndome.  It took some time before the soldiers in the broad entranceway\ncould be made to understand what was wanted of them in relation to the\nstrange, grizzled and begrimed Captain.  The detachment to escort the\nprisoners they expected, and Liebenstein's name they knew.....  Finally\nafter several attempts on the com-line, during which a voice on the\nother side could be heard to utter clearly, \"There must be some\nmistake,\" a sympathetic looking officer of indistinguishable rank\nemerged form an elevator and said:\n\n\"Group Commander Brunner?  Please come with me.\"\n\nHe followed lifeless, along with the boy.  They went up in the sealed\ncapsule, and then across and then, for some reason, down again.  The\nmotioned stopped.  Two doors slid apart.\n\nThey walked down a short hallway, and entered a room.  There were three\npeople in it.  A military policeman, a Belgian officer, and a woman\nwith dark hair.\n\nThat the woman was his wife he slowly realized, because she came up and\nembraced him gently.  But his mind was so uncertain, and his body so\nweak that he wondered if he were awake, or it was all a trick, or.....\nShe looked up at him with shining eyes, kissed his unmoving lips, and\nsaid:          \"Olaf, are you all right?\"\n\n\"Who is the man?\" he said, as to a stranger.  And at this some kind of\nlife began to revive inside him.  But it was not love.  An ember caught\nto flame and, smoldering, began to rise.\n\nThe man in question rose, looking apologetic and unsure.  He came\nnearer and offered his hand, which Brunner left dangling.  Then with a\nheavy accent and sudden coldness he said.  \"I am the man who brought\nyour wife here.  I am General.....\" and his mouth produced some name.\n\nWHILE A BELGIAN OFFICER WAS RAPING YOUR WIFE.  RAPING YOU WHILE A\nBELGIAN OFFICER WAS RAPING YOUR WIFE.  RAPING YOUR WIFE, was all that\nhis mind and last instinct understood.\n\nSomething savage took hold of him.  He struck the man with such a\nsudden, vicious blow that even in his weakened state it nearly broke\nboth jaw and hand, as the general staggered and fell back.\n\nThe MP came towards him and his wife caught his arm, which was raised\nto strike again.  \"Olaf, what are you doing?\" she pleaded.  But he\ncould not perceive what was happening and shook free of her grasp, and\nwith starvation violence moved toward his foe again.  But the MP stood\nbetween them.\n\nHis wife turned his numb and again lifeless form toward her, and with\ntears in her eyes, said words that almost made it through to his mind.\n\n\"Olaf, please.  He never touched me.\"\n\nAnd then in a simple, childlike sob he said her name.\n\n\"Ara?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's me.  It's me, it's all right.\"\n\nAnd again she embraced him, instinctively and with all the love she\ncould muster massaging his back, the taut muscles of his neck.  He\nstepped back after a time and held her arms, confused.\n\n\"Then why.....\"\n\n\"To be a governess for his children, and to keep me from the prison\ncolonies.\"\n\n\"To protect you?  Why?\"\n\n\"Because I'm pregnant.\"\n\n\"I thought you said he never.....\"  It was all too much.  He looked\nhard at her figure, perhaps a little fuller, tried to reckon the\nmonths.  All useless.  He did not understand.  He did not understand.\nThen it was his eyes that pleaded, and he felt himself beginning to\npass out.\n\n\"Ara?\"  His last hope.  \"What is happening?\"\n\n\"I had the child, Olaf.  A son.  YOUR SON.\"\n\nAt this he let out a piteous groan, as the lance pierced his heart.\nAnd he stumbled, then collapsed into a corner, weeping uncontrollably,\noblivious of his wife's caressing hands.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThe next two days he spent in a hospital on Rembrandt, then moved with\nhis wife and baby son, to temporary quarters aboard the largely\nundamaged Kythera.  With the vessels of his former destroyer group\neither crippled, destroyed outright, or reassigned to new contingents,\nhis next command remained uncertain.\n\nHe was offered, if he wanted it, a two month leave of absence.  But in\nhis present state, and with the uncertainty of war all around him---his\nown sense of duty, and the desire to find the safest haven for his\nyoung family---he simply could not decide.  Also, with the issue still\nvery much in doubt, and the slow realization that he was good at what\nhe did, he did not know if he wished to trust the future to strangers:\nif his place was not, after all, on the bridge of a Coalition\ndestroyer.\n\nHe could not decide, and only asked for more time.\n\nThat night aboard the cruiser, the first they had spent together after\nthe long separation, it was understood between them without any word or\nsign, that they should not yet try to make love.  Instead they lay\nquietly in the bed, with the newborn in the crib beside them, talking,\nkissing, and gently touching in the subdued light and near darkness of\nthe room.  They spoke in the way that couples do, who have not yet\ntaken their troth for granted, understanding with fewer words what the\nother meant, but still trying to read the deeper meaning of what was\nsaid, and to reaffirm their own commitment by expressions of special\ntenderness and love.\n\n\"But tell me the truth,\" he continued.  \"That he never touched you I\ncan believe.  It shows in his eyes.  But why does a conquering General\nin the midst of an war, a widower, take a beautiful young woman from a\ndetention center?  Only to protect her, and to be a governess for his\nchildren?  Forgive me, Ara, but no one is that noble.\"\n\n\"Yes.  I think deep down he always hoped that I would fall in love with\nhim, with his children, and become his wife or mistress.\"  Her fingers\ngently reassured his throbbing chest.  Then, as if embarrassed and\nneeding to change the subject, she added.  \"But really, I'm not as\nattractive as all that.  It is only in your eyes that I'm beautiful.\"\n\n\"Then the rest of the world is blind.....  But how could he think to\nkeep you forever, or that you would abandon your own home, your own\nfamily?\"  From these words she understood that he had accepted her\nfaithfulness, and as far as this was possible, dismissed jealousy,\nwhich would only wound them both.\n\n\"You have to remember how it must have seemed to them at the time.  Our\ncolonies had been taken, along with the Dutch.  And shortly afterward,\nSchiller was destroyed. . .and the Coalition thrown into confusion.\nThe blindness of the conqueror, I suppose.  They had known nothing but\nvictory, didn't seem to realize the men that they had killed, and the\nlives they had torn apart---\"\n\n\"I'm glad I hit him.  BASTARDS.  I wish they could have seen their\nhandiwork at Dracus.\"\n\nShe rose on her elbow and looked down at him, trying to understand the\nchange.  He would never have said (or done) such a thing a year ago.\nHe turned toward her, with the changed eyes and soul of all innocent\nyoung, thrust into war and forced to grow up too quickly.  Then all at\nonce her eyes clouded with pain, as she seemed to realize that she too\nhad been unaware of the suffering caused by such men.  And her own\nanguish and grief, that she had had to discipline for so long, for her\nunborn child's sake, spilled over.  She hid herself against him.\n\n\"He was always telling me that the Coalition was finished, that you\nwere probably dead.....\"\n\nAnd he felt too what she must have endured, and the veil was lifted\nbetween them.  They had both suffered, both changed, though their love\nfor each other had not.  Or if it had, had only deepened and grown\nstronger.          But with the almost masculine resolve that he knew so\nwell in her, she still her tears and pushed forward, determined to\nfinish the thought---to face the hard truth.\n\n\"But I never lost hope.  I knew you would find me.  Somehow I knew.\"\nBut she could not maintain this control any longer.  Nor did she wish\nto.  She set her face to his chest and wept silently as he comforted\nher.\n\n\"My beautiful Ara.  Forgive me.  I was so wrapped up in my own loss, I\nhad forgotten how it must have been for you.\"\n\nShe became quieter, shook her head against him  \"I was all right.  And\nwith the baby inside me. . .I wasn't alone somehow.  But I was so\nterribly worried for all of us.  I knew how hard you would take our\nseparation, not knowing.\"\n\nHe released a breath, felt once more his own dependence.  \"How can you\nlove me?\" he said mournfully.  \"I am such a weak and timid fool.\"\n\nShe put a finger to his lips.\n\n\"Do you know what Colonel Liebenstein told me on Rembrandt?\"          He\nshook his head, eyes closed.\n\n\"He told me that he was recommending you for a Medal of Valor---that\nyou held together a destroyer group consisting of twelve ships, in\nwhich nine were knocked out or severely damaged. . .and held your\nposition against an attacking forced nearly twice your strength, for\nthirty-six hours without relief or reinforcement.  Do you know what\nelse he told me?\"  He could only release a troubled breath, that seemed\nto have been caged inside him for years.  \"He said that you defended\nDracus with equal tenacity, and landing, kept your head when more\nexperienced men couldn't.  He said that you've been sick and hurting\nthroughout, but all the while have been an exemplary officer.\"  He felt\nhot tears flow down both sides of his face.  \"It's true, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes.....  But I wish I didn't cry so much.  It makes me feel weak, and\nI think that in your eyes----\"  Again the finger touched his lips.\n\n\"Stop, Olaf.\"  She kissed him, then snuggled close.  \"It takes so much\nmore courage to admit your feelings than to deny them.  Why do you\nthink I fell in love with you?\"\n\nHe turned toward her as he had longed to do from the first night of\ntheir separation, and buried his face in the soft hair about her neck.\n\n\"Dear God, I love you.\"  And in that moment he could not bear to hear\nhis son cry, because he knew that he was nothing more, and never would\nbe, than the helpless creature beside them.\n\nAs his wife rose to nurse the child he recovered himself, and like Ara,\ncontinued the thought.\n\nSUCH IS THE LOT OF HUMANITY.  And who nourished and protected them, the\nchildren who had grown?  Was there a God, or was Man truly alone in his\nwalk through the world of flesh?  In all that he had lived through\nthese past months, he could not begin to answer that question.  There\nhad to be something---he had only his own experience to go\nby---because.....  As close as he had come to death and despair, they\nhad never been able to completely overwhelm him.  But had he, and Ara,\nsurvived because of something outside, or inside?  And was that\nsomething God?  Was God internal, some invisible undercurrent of Life\nand Nature, or external, some being or beings who watched it all from\nwithout?  And where to find the answers?  If there was an answer.\n\nHe remembered the words to Johann Schiller's 'Ode to Joy,' set to\nangelic chorus by Beethoven.  \"For surely, beyond the stars there\ndwells a loving father.  Seek Him there, beyond the stars.\"  And this\nseemed particularly relevant and true, until he remembered that\nSchiller had been unmade by the hands of men.\n\nAnd he remembered the horror of Dracus, which had made him see, and\nfeel, all others.\n\nAnd these continual barriers to faith and serenity were just what was\nso maddening.  How could one believe in anything after knowing the rape\nof war?  Or disbelieve after finding his wife (and himself) still alive\nagainst such odds?  No matter how much of life one experienced, no\nmatter how much knowledge he acquired or how 'wise' he became---he\nwondered seriously if such a word held any real meaning---there was\nalways one more piece of information to take in, one more tragedy to\nrationalize, and try to find some reason for.  And until this new,\nconfounded fact was taken in and digested, it upset and unraveled all\nthe others, and would not let a man with half a conscience rest.\n\nThrough this long chain of reasoning, and especially this last thought,\nhe finally unearthed what was bothering him, and poisoning the\nrecuperative peace that he should have been experiencing.  He started\nto rebel against what he found there, but knew he would be unable.\n\nWhat was troubling him was simply this.  In the earlier days of his\nacquaintance with Col. Joyce, and for reasons known only to himself,\nthe Russian had confided probably more than he should have about Soviet\nintentions during the war.  Perhaps it was the need to express and\njustify his thoughts to a younger man not yet so cynical, so certain\nand so weary of life.  In any event he had told him, and Brunner now\nknew why they had insisted that the Coalition strike Dutch Larkspur\nfirst, and why they were now being instructed to withdraw.\n\nThe new orders had arrived that very day.  They were to return to the\nfringes of Cerberus, there to re-form with heavy Russian\nreinforcements, for the inevitable assault on the Athena colonies---the\ncampaign to liberate and reclaim his home.\n\nThat was all fine, and how it should be.  Incredibly tempting, except\nthat in the meantime they were to leave Rembrandt and Van Gogh in the\nhands of the Soviets.  And he could no longer pretend ignorance as to\nwhat would happen next:  one more SSR possession, one less home for the\nDutch.  And one more subjugated people, for those who would not, or\ncould not leave.  It was 1946 all over again.\n\nDAMN IT!\n\nHe had seen too much suffering and loss, been spared from final\nannihilation too many times to feel no responsibility, or to take such\nnews easily.  It was so unfair.  What remained of the Dutch forces,\nalong with their Swedish allies, had been contacted and told of the\ncolonies' liberation. They were on their way, with deepest gratitude,\nto re-occupy their homes, and rebuild their lives.\n\nAnd what would they find upon arrival?  The Soviets firmly entrenched,\nregretfully explaining that for strategic purposes they must maintain,\nfor the time being, a provisional government and strong military\npresence there.  But not to worry, they would say, so soon as the\nconflict was ended and peace assured, all would again be set right.\n\nTHE BLOOD LEECHES, FEEDING OF THE MISERY OF OTHERS TO EXPAND THEIR\nDOMAIN.  But what could he possibly do about it?  He was only one man,\nand had his own family to think of first.....  No.  Though the excuse\nto turn his back was ready-made, he knew he could not yield.  For this\nwas what his ancestors had done under Hitler:  in the name of loving\nand protecting their own, disregarding the lives and humanity of all\nwho opposed them.  It was WRONG, the seed and heart of all betrayal.\n\nHe watched his wife with the baby at her breast, knew there were other\nwives and children, other husbands like himself.  All had lives, and\nall deserved to live them freely.\n\nHe resolved then and there to request a larger command, to speak to\nLiebenstein, and take it from there.  He refused to allow the anguish\nand death of the battle just three days prior. . .to amount to nothing\nmore than another senseless tragedy.  His comrades had fought too long\nand too hard, and too many died. . .for that.  And the fire that burned\nsuddenly, inexorably inside him, consumed all doubt.\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nThe next morning he asked for, and received, command of a light cruiser\nwhose Captain had been severely wounded, along with such escort as\ncould be assembled from the decimated ranks of other destroyer groups\nsuch as his own.  He then went to speak to Col. Liebenstein, who upon\nthe death of Gen. Tarkanean had become Fleet Commander.  He found the\nman seated at his desk.\n\nThe Colonel, a decent man but with many concerns, heard what he had to\nsay, listening darkly and looking up at him with an ever deeper frown\nof discontent.  But whether this frown was directed at the Soviets, the\nresult of his own feelings of regret, or anger at the willful young\nCaptain, it became harder and harder to discern.  Brunner grew more\nreluctant to lay out his full intentions before him, and finally\nstopped altogether.  Liebenstein looked hard at him for what seemed a\nlong time, then spoke.\n\n\"What, exactly, are you proposing we do?\"  The younger man's intent,\nsuffering eyes did have a way of making one feel uncomfortable.\n\n\"Resist them.  Delay, object.  For Christ's sake, the Dutch will be\nhere in ninety-six---\"\n\n\"NO.\"\n\nBrunner lowered his face, red with rage and shame.  \"But how can we\njust.....\"  He could not finish for the lump in his throat.\nLiebenstein became angry.\n\n\"I said, NO.  And if you disobey me in this, or follow up with any\nscheme of your own, your next command will be of a cell-block.  Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"  Brunner saluted brusquely, and started to leave.  The\nColonel called him back.\n\n\"You have something more you want to say to me?  You are still one of\nmy officers; I won't have it festering inside.\"\n\n\"Yes, Colonel.\"  His hesitated, his voice shaking with emotion.  \"I\nhave to write nearly two hundred letters to next of kin.  When I\ncontact the families of the deceased. . .what the hell am I supposed to\nsay they died for?\"  Without waiting for an answer he stalked out of\nthe room, leaving a shadow behind him.\n\nLiebenstein could not help feeling rueful, though he tried to justify\nhis position, musing darkly that the same qualities of stubborn\nrighteousness that inspired men to follow such a leader, often led to\nthe destruction of all.  But still there was a shadow in the room.\n\n\n*\n\n\nThe first thing that Brunner did upon assuming command of the Icarus\n(he found the name somehow appropriate) was to transfer and surround\nhimself with as many of his former comrades as he could.  A bond had\nbeen formed between them in those thirty-six hours that could never be\nbroken, and he wanted them there if.....  He also knew they would\nremain loyal, and understand his purpose.\n\nHe asked his wife to remain about the Kythera until the issue was\nresolved, but she refused.  And it was no use trying to dissuade her\nonce she set her mind to something.  Again the qualities he prized\nabout all others showed through in her---loyalty, and courage in time\nof need.\n\nFor there comes a time in every man's life when he must put it all on\nthe line, and take a dangerous chance.  Brunner had felt himself\nfighting for so long, without knowing why, that even the reunion with\nhis wife, and the unexpected birth of his son, had not been enough to\npacify his need to KNOW.  In fact, they had intensified it.\n\nHe had brought a new life into the world, and the responsibility he\nfelt both for that act, and for the fusing of his life with Ara's, set\nagainst a background of war and death, all but overwhelmed him.\nWithout knowing if mortal life were ultimately just, or inherently\nsinister and cruel, they crushed him utterly.\n\nUpon coming to the morning after the Dracus landing, one thought only\nwould take shape in his mind, and hammered at him relentlessly.  \"What\nkind of a world is this?  What kind of a world?\"\n\nAnd now he had to answer that question not only for himself, but for\nhis son as well.  And thoughts of death's separation from Ara, who was\nyears younger, and infinitely healthier than himself, unhinged him with\nequal strength.  Did he have the right.....  WAS THERE ANYTHING BEYOND\nTHE CRADLE AND THE GRAVE?  \nFor him, now, it was all reduced to the same ancient question, which\nfor the sake of his soul he could not put off any longer.  WAS THERE\nGOD?  And of equal and inseparable importance, the manifestations of\nwhich he saw clearly before him:  COULD ONE MAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE?\nCould he stand up for what he believed, resist what he knew to be evil,\nand still survive?\n\nTo find these answers was to him worth risking all.  He had not forced\nthe issue, nor was it due to some flaw in his character that he saw it\nas it was.  It had come to him of itself, inevitable, and now he would\nfind out.  A part of him wished that he could somehow send away his\nwife and son.  But she would not hear of it, and that, too, was\nprobably as it should be.  Better no life than half life.  The child\nremained on Kythera.\n\n\n\n*                        *                        *\n\n\n\nThe withdrawal had begun.  The Soviet ships remained at a distant\nsemi-circle beyond Rembrandt, broken into two groups with a wide\ncorridor between.  Through this channel passed slowly, as if in solemn\nchanging of the guard, the scorched and battle-marked Coalition fleet.\n\nThis much Liebenstein had insisted upon, meaning for the Russians to\nget a good hard look at those who had truly fought and won the battle.\nThe young Captain's words were not wholly without effect, though the\nColonel, as a proud man must when his mind is swayed by another and he\nis forced to act, told himself that the sentiments behind the move were\nhis own.  In fact, he had all but put Brunner from his mind.  It was\nonly from oversight that he allowed his contingent to be the last to\npass through.\n\nOnly they did not pass through.\n\nSeeing the tardy vessels in his rear viewscreen, the Colonel thought at\nfirst there must be some mistake, or mechanical problem, and so was not\noverly concerned.  Until looking back in horror and sudden\nunderstanding, he recognized the call letters of the light cruiser, and\nremembered under whose command.....  And saw the accompanying\ndestroyers fanning out to either side of it---BLOCKING THE SOVIETS'\nPATH.\n\nAnd there they stayed, facing down two battleships and escort, twenty\ntimes their own strength.\n\n\"HUMBOLT,\" he ejaculated to his communications officer.  \"Get me the\nbridge of the Icarus. . .quickly!\"  The com officer did as he was told,\nhailing the vessel several times.  \"WELL?\"  After a moment.\n\n\"Sorry, sir.  There's nothing wrong with the equipment.....  She just\nwon't respond.\"  The colonel was livid.\n\n\"Then get me number one. . .number TWO destroyer.  ANY of them!\"\n\n\"Still trying.....  No response, sir.\"\n\nThe reason there was no response was that the destroyers had shut down\nall but channeled communications between themselves and their immediate\nCommander.  And the voice and com-screen of the Icarus were otherwise\nengaged.  Its outgoing signal, however, was neither coded, nor directed\ntoward the Soviet battleship only.  The whole of both fleets were free\nto listen, and to judge.\n\nBrunner stood in the sunken middle of the flying bridge---his wife\nstood beside him---gazing with surprising composure into the angry\nfeatures on the screen before him:  Colonel Joyce, the man with the\npower to end his life.\n\n\"Colonel.  Thank you for speaking with me.  I don't believe you've met\nmy---\"  The voice that cut him off was cold and cruel.\n\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing, Brunner?\"\n\n\"I am experiencing difficulty with my ship's retreat mechanism:  she\ndoesn't seem to be able to leave the colonies just yet.\"\n\n\"And how long do you think that will last?\"  A threat more than a\nquestion.  The two understood one another perfectly.\n\n\"I'd say, roughly of course, about forty-eight hours.  Just about the\ntime the Dutch return to---\"\n\n\"Now listen to me, you pathetic little worm.  If you don't get out of\nthe way, and I mean RIGHT now, I'll blow you and your little band of\nheroes to bloody shrapnel.  Don't think I won't!\"\n\nBrunner's voice shook with subdued passion, but not fear.\n\n\"I don't think you won't.  I know it.  Because to do that you'd have to\nbrutally attack, and murder your own allies.  And have to explain to\nthe Coalition, the Japanese, and everybody else, how you had no choice\nbut to desecrate our victory, and steal the home planets---\"  Joyce\ntried to interrupt, but he would not let him.  \"And it's NOT going to\nhappen.\"  Again the other tried---  \"You want me?  Then come and TAKE\nme!\"\n\n\"I'll give you thirty seconds.\"  Joyce turned to his gunnery officer,\nwho nodded his understanding.  \"Starting now.\"\n\nBrunner waited till the count was down to six.  His voice was the ice\nof Infinity.\n\n\"Get the fuck out of here.\"\n\n\"BRUNNER!\"  A single shot was fired, impacting upon, and with a round\nand outward glow lighting up the forward shields of the Icarus.  In the\nensuing concussion his wife was thrown down with a start, and small\nfires broke out on the bridge.\n\nThis was too much for Liebenstein.  He started to send a signal to\nJoyce, but saw that the human miracle was taking place without him.\nWhere before there had been ten destroyers in the breach, now there\nwere fourteen, one so badly damaged that it could barely thread its way\nthrough the staggered ranks of the Soviets.\n\nThe renegade ships were German.\n\nThen, without any order being given, first one Coalition vessel and\nthen another began to break formation and move back to defend their\ncomrades.  Brunner had his answer, though he was too strangled by tears\nto take it in.  Liebenstein's battleship at last joined the others, and\nturned to face the Enemy.\n\nNo more shots were fired.  The Dutch returned to their homes.\n\n\n\n........................................................................\n......................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE ABYSS\n\n\nThe final star gate was completed, and by all the signs, not a day too\nsoon.  Swift-moving Soviet reconnaissance vessels moved with increased\nfrequency and boldness just out of firing range, marking the numbers\nand combat readiness of the Third Fleet, and even, if they knew what to\nlook for, the progress of the Gate itself.  Nothing else trackable\nmoved within the vicinity; but Hayes' knew this meant nothing.  The\nRussian anti-detection screens, as demonstrated by earlier encounters,\nwere vastly improved, and their four Supercarriers (by the latest\nintelligence) were capable of full e-light warp from well outside the\narc of his surveillance.  And at that speed.....\n\nThe Dreadnought remained still while her troubled mites hurried back\ninside the womb, hopeful of escape.  As if literally animal young, they\nseemed to sense for the first time in their half-wakened minds the\npresence of a shark, or some other dreadful creature, that shared those\ndepths with them, wishing them harm, and more powerful even than the\nmother, who from time of first consciousness had been the very symbol\nand embodiment of strength.  Now into their dark hole she would crawl,\nand emerge again far, far away.\n\n*\n\nThe last chute was raised, and the goliath moved slowly forward,\ngathering speed, eradicating the trivial miles which separated her from\nthe Gate, and from the possible undoing of the civilized world.  Earth!\n The hexagon was now clearly visible as it loomed larger and nearer,\nsurrounded once more by the dwarfed engineering vessels which had\nshaped it, and with its might, burned out the hollow darkness beyond.\nWhat would become of these, since the frame had been mined, with orders\nto destroy it upon the passage of the Dreadnought, none could say.\n\nHayes leaned forward in martial attitude against the rail before the\nscreen, his lower jaw locking tight, then releasing, like a vise-grips.\n Frank stood at his short distance from him, churning with emotion.\nThey were drawing closer.  As so many times before they would pass\nthrough.  But this time, on the other side would be.....\n\nA succession of brilliant white lasers leapt out of nowhere and\nconverged upon the cold blue Frame, which in turn glowed sullenly from\nwithin, convulsed, blew outward and came apart.  The Gate was\nshattered, and would no longer serve.\n\n\"Reverse thrust!\" someone shouted.  The engineering vessels, of their\nown volition, had begun to scatter in all directions.  Two seemed\npartially crippled, and one moved not at all.\n\nHayes let out a sound more bestial than human, after which he bawled,\n\"Where did those shots come from!\"  A technician turned towards him as\nif to answer, but his face was deathly white.\n\nHayes strode toward him with his arm raised, as for a blow.  \"OUT with\nit!\"\n\n\"From the Dreadnought, sir.\"\n\n\"From WHERE on the Dreadnought!\"\n\nThe man hesitated, and Hayes really did strike him.  He wiped the blood\nfrom his mouth, and with his eyes to the floor said numbly,\n\n\"Auxiliary Laser Deployment.\"\n\nAs if cued by these words, the young officer that Hayes had berated on\nthe eve of the Schiller conquest rose and came forward.\n\n\"I did it, you dirty old son of a bitch.  You're not going to destroy\nMY home.\"  He whirled to address his stupefied compatriots, who had\nturned from their stations to face him.  \"It's all been a lie!  Stone\ndidn't order any of this, and Plant didn't kill him.  It was THAT\nbastard,\" pointing, \"and Hesse that---\"\n\nHe never finished the sentence.  Hayes, purple with rage and every vein\nof his forehead bulging, struck him a savage blow across the head with\na conduit wrench, the first object that came to hand.  The man fell\nlimply forward, not quite unconscious, emitting a weak grown of pain.\n\nAt that moment two MP's rushed into the room, and Hayes ordered them to\nlift him by the arms and turn him around.  The pistol that he always\ncarried at his hip he raised and held at arm's length.  It was clear\nthat he meant to shoot the man.\n\n\"Stop it!\" cried Frank suddenly, rushing between them.  \"You can't just\nkill a man without a trial. . .for doing what he thought was right.\"\nIt was equally clear that Frank himself was unsure of the truth, and\nhad been unnerved by the youth's allegations.\n\n\"Who the HELL do you think you are?\" bellowed the other.  \"Giving ME\norders!  Stand aside or I'll kill you both.\"\n\nThis was too much for the MP's.  Who was their rightful commander?\nWhat was happening?  They looked at each other in confusion, continued\nto hold the gunnery officer, though less firmly.  Indecision reigned\nupon the bridge.\n\nIt was at this moment that Chaos played her final trick.\n\n\"Admiral,\" spoke an officer, who had turned back to face his station.\n\"Two enormous Carriers have just come out of warp.  Super-Soviet\nconfiguration.  Bearing 00, 666.\n\n\"It's the Russians, sir.\"\n\n\n*\n\n\n\"It's the Russians, sir.\"\n\n\"Now look what you've done!\" cried Hayes in his fury, unable to realize\nthat all Frank had DONE was to keep him from killing a man untried.\n\"Get him out of here.\"\n\nThe MP's looked again at each other, then at Frank, not knowing who was\nmeant or what should be done.  The latter inclined his head swiftly,\nand they took the young officer away.  As they left it, Calder entered\nthe enclosure.\n\nHayes whirled in fuming circles, ordering the chutes to be lowered and\nthe attack-ships discharged.  The officers at their stations either\ncarried out his instructions or turned to Frank, who with a gesture of\nweary despair raised his arms as if to say, \"What else can we do?\"\n\n\"We've got to move away from the gate, General,\" came the timid voice\nof the deployment officer.\n\n\"Then do it, ass!  Take us back and to port.\"  And Hayes rattled off\nsome meaningless coordinates.  Like a gored lion he stalked back and\nforth, out of control, breathing too deeply and at intervals releasing\ndesperate, maddened execrations.  Another hesitant voice.\n\n\"They've.....  They've begun to discharge and form ranks.\"\n\n\"Of COURSE they have!  They didn't come here to talk!\"\n\nIn his earlier, false-confident musing, Hayes had said that it would\ntake twice the Fleet's strength to overmatch him.  And that was exactly\nwhat he now confronted---two Soviet Supercarriers, each nearly equal in\ngirth and firepower to the Dreadnought queen, and each bearing a\ngreater number of swarming killer bees.\n\nThe Russians did not attack immediately, but remained at some distance,\nwaiting perhaps for all their vessels to be deployed, or to be sure\nthat Hayes was alone and the fight would go their way.  Nor did the\nAmericans make the first move, intimidated and dismayed by the sudden\nchange in their fortunes, staring across the void at the ever widening\nfence of the opposing Armada.\n\nAn army used to winning, rarely knows how to face defeat.\n\nThe Dreadnought had drawn back and away from the remains of the broken\nGate, so that now it lay ahead of them and far to the left.  The\nout-ships as well, low on fuel and tentative, spread outward so that\ntwo almost parallel walls were formed, filled with eyes.  The would-be\ncombatants faced each other across the margin that they themselves\ncreated:  the empty distance of war's chasm, that unholy no-man's land\nwherein, once entered, frightened men kill frightened men until one\nside has had enough.\n\n\"Shall I try to contact them?\" asked the young com officer pitifully.\nBut at that moment the Russians started forward.\n\nBut at that moment something else occurred as well.  A patch of silvery\nsheen became visible at a distance to the Commonwealth right, almost at\na direct line between the armies from the broken and still\ndark-smoldering gate upon their left.  The advancing Soviet forces came\nto a halt, confused.  But Hayes became suddenly calm, and a vengeful\nsmile played about the corners of his mouth.  But he must play this new\ncard correctly.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked a voice.  And even as the words were spoken a\nfourth Goliath appeared, for an instant gleaming white, then graying\nonce more as it passed through the pierced screen of silver.  Hayes was\nnot the only one with a star gate.  The American Seventh Fleet,\nentombed within the carrier Eisenhower, was at hand.\n\nQuickly taking stock of the situation, Commanding Admiral Robeson moved\nto join the re-heartened Third, attempted to make contact with both\nparties, and reluctantly, since he did not know how things would turn,\nbegan to discharge and align his own forces.  The parallel planes still\nexisted, only now they were closer and more equal, a colossal gathering\nof some fourteen hundred ships, prepared for a confrontation that even\nthe mythic battles of the Bhagavad-Gita could not match.\n\nAnd this was no fable of gods and clouds and chariots, decrying the\nillusions of the physical world, but hard and deadly reality.  And if\nthe two sides of fire-breathing metal, like ghastly cymbals of Death,\nwere brought together with a crash, the awful sound would shatter the\nuneasy stillness and continue to be heard, would ripple far, far in all\ndirections, and the peace that good men prayed for would be lost.\nHayes would have his Great War, after all.\n\n\"General Hayes,\" said the Dreadnought com officer.  \"Admiral Robeson is\nrequesting to speak with Admiral Frank.\"\n\n\"Cut him off,\" was Hayes' dispassionate reply.\n\n\"WHAT?\" cried Frank hotly.  \"Why shouldn't I speak to him?\"\n\nAgain the general's voice was calm.  \"It's some trick of the Soviets'.\nJohn Robeson no longer commands the Seventh Fleet.\"\n\n\"But sir,\" began the com officer.  \"He's on the coded frequency, and\nthe voice match---\"\n\n\"I SAID, cut him off.\"\n\n.....\n\nAnd then Frank did it.  He uttered the simple (and often just) word\nthat no subordinate, any time, anywhere, in any army of men, is ever\nallowed to speak.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What the hell do you mean, NO!\"  And suddenly all Hayes' former fury\nreturned.  His face distorted wildly, and the veins of his skull and\nneck stood out further still.\n\n\"I've known John Robeson for thirty years.  There's no way he would do\nanything.....  It's YOU I don't trust.  No more running.  No more\nhiding from the truth.\"  He turned to the terrified young man, whose\neyes moved back and forth between them.  \"Soldier, open that channel.\"\n\n\"You, traitorous, DOG!\" screamed Hayes, and began to rush at him,\nheedless.\n\nBut all at once he stopped, and stood perfectly still.  His right\neyebrow twitched strangely, and the whole face began to work in comic\nspasms.\n\nHe collapsed to the floor, where Calder caught him up, and rested the\nbeloved head on his knee.  The general's trembling jaw uttered sounds\nbut could not, as it struggled so desperately to do, create\nintelligible speech.  Charles William Hayes had suffered a massive\nstroke, and lay dying in his soldier's arms.\n\n\"Get a doctor in here, quickly,\" ordered Frank, once again his own\nmaster.  Then turning to the com-man, \"Put Robeson on visual, apprise\nhim of our status, and tell him I'll be with him as soon as I can.\"\n\nAt that moment the only son of William and Charlotte Hayes gave up his\nspirit, trying to tell his only friend that he loved him.\n\n\"You can't.....\" blubbered Calder.  \"No, please, no.\"  Their foreheads\nmet, and he wept.\n\nFrank approached him, and put a sympathetic hand on his shoulder.  \"I'm\nsorry, Michael.  I truly am.  But he would have led us all to ruin.\"\n\n\"You!\" shocked Calder through his tears.  \"YOU killed him.....  He was\ngoing to save us!\"  And in a sudden fury of determination like that of\nhis dead idol, he seized the pistol and Hayes' hip.  And as the other\nmoved away, waving NO with his hands in front of him, shot Frank in the\nchest and killed him.\n\nCalder lowered his master's body gently.  Then rising, holding the\nweapon still, looked about him and brandished it fiercely.  His second\nshot destroyed the motor-drive to the bridge's double doors, sealing\nthem shut.  After another threatening wave at the benumbed circle of\nmen, he turned to the astonished face of Robeson on the screen.\n\n\"Calder, what in God's name?\"\n\nBut the man's senses were gone.  All that remained were hatred and\ndeath, wrenched forward through bitter tears.\n\n\"You, NIGGER!\"  The word was terrible to hear.  \"You killed him too!\"\nAnd he shot the screen as well.\n\n\"Now listen to me, all of you!  We're going to fight those red bastards\nif we have to do it alone.  Move the ship forward, battle speed One!\"\nHe aimed the pistol at the hesitating officer, who feeling himself cast\ninto Hell, obeyed.\n\n\n*\n\n\nWhat the Soviet commanders aboard the carriers Lenin and Brezhnev\nheard, was Robeson telling them that Hayes was dead and the bridge of\nthe Dreadnought in chaos---imploring them not to begin what couldn't\nlater be stopped, and might lead to galactic holocaust.  But what they\nsaw was the prow of the behemoth coming towards them and starting to\nfire.  Their instructions had been to eliminate Hayes, and if\nnecessary, the entire Third Fleet.\n\nThe Dreadnought continued to move forward; it was nearly at the\nmidpoint between two armies.  And now the Eisenhower moved forward as\nwell.  That this was caused by Robeson putting a tractor beam on his\nship's counterpart, and trying unsuccessfully to check its advance they\ncould not know, because they had stopped listening.  And so, very\nnaturally, they began to fire back.\n\nBut then a very different kind of 'miracle' occurred.\n\nFrom out of the rent and improperly sealed Gate on the Commonwealth\nleft, and from the outlet of the distant Gate to their right, whose\nsilvery sheet now fluttered as in a haunted breeze, the horrible black\nanti-matter of Nothingness began to seep out like an inky cloud.\nPerhaps drawn each to the other, perhaps triggered by the living metal\nthat now stood equidistant between them, like ill-shaped hands it oozed\nslowly together, a darkness that would envelope the stars.\n\nAnd with it came a sound:  a silence so awful, a death so complete and\neternal, that Time itself seemed to ripple like a black wave between\nthe two armies.\n\nInstinctively they drew back, unnerved and unhinged.  But the\nDreadnought remained perfectly still, immobilized, while the hands of\nUnmaking drew nearer.....\n\nAnd then they met.  The solid-huge metal of that once proud and\nfearless sword, swayed in layers of impossible fluidity, faded, and was\ngone.\n\nThe Hands joined and began to pull together their distant shoulders.\nThe armies fled, and no more death (by them) could be wrought.\n\nFrom out of somewhere brilliant white globes began to appear, and to\nfence off the Darkness with glittering webs.\n\n\n\n\n............................................................\n\n\n\n\n\nUPON THE MOUNTAINTOP\n\n\nSeveral months had passed and much had changed for the increased and\nsolidified Coalition Fleet.  As they drew nearer the tri-colonies of\nhis home, Brunner stood upon the bridge of the Kythera now only as an\nobserver.  He had been relieved of command after the incident at\nRembrandt, and his case had not yet been tried.\n\nBut this was only a formality.  In the light of recent events, the\nresulting loss of the Soviets as an ally was now of relatively small\nimportance, while from the standpoint of pride and independence, much\nhad been gained.\n\nThough he had never wanted it, and told himself it meant nothing to\nhim, Brunner had become a national hero.  And to the Dutch, so often\nstoic and reserved, his defiant stand aboard the Icarus had become\nsomething of a legend.  He found it all exceedingly strange, rather too\nmuch of a contrast to the isolation and despair which he had felt such\na short time before.  And he wondered how many other 'heroes' of the\npast were simply men who had done what they had to do at the time,\nthinking (and caring) not at all about posterity.\n\nBut such thoughts were very far from him now.  He was concerned about\nthe approaching battle; and not at all in the way he always had been\nbefore.  For one thing his younger brother, who had joined the space\nnavy after the fall of Athena, would be present.  He had done what he\ncould to protect him, getting him assigned to a friend's destroyer\ngroup, but the added worry was not lessened because of it.  Fighter\nescorts were always in danger, and though Tomas was a good pilot, he\nhad never before flown in combat, and seemed overly determined to make\nhis mark before the war ended.\n\nThere was little enough doubt as to who would prevail.  The Belgians\nand Swiss, now bearing the brunt of the U.N. and Commonwealth\npeace-keeping efforts (nothing like a pang of conscience), had drawn\noff most of their forces to defend what remained of their original\npossessions.  Word had also been received that the French Elite, under\ntremendous pressure both home and abroad, had withdrawn from Irish New\nBelfast, and left it to its original keepers.\n\nWhat troubled him now was that men on both sides would be killed, to\nsettle a dispute which every day became more academic.  The Alliance\nhad been beaten, and yet their pride would not let them surrender\nwithout a fight, what had never been theirs.  The Coalition was\nvindicated, but still bitter at its wounds, remained set upon claiming\nthe debt in full.  He found both motives equally abhorrent, and had\nretained enough humanity not to think of himself as East German first,\nlast and always.  The words 'us' and 'them' still left an aftertaste.\n\nHis one consolation, and it was not a substantial one, was that he\nhimself would play no part in it.  His supposed aptitude for (and\ncuriosity about) the ways of war had been more than quenched.  If it\nwere humanly possible, he intended to resign from the military\nimmediately after his hearing, and never fight again.  His earlier\nrevulsion to bloodshed had returned, redoubled in strength by\nexperience.\n\nIt was not easy to put such a past behind him, and the images of\nvictims and violence that had burned indelibly into his memory, still\ntroubled his thoughts of the future.  And as he watched his son\ncontinue to grow, his one prayer was that Man would finally, finally\ncome to his senses, and have done forever with cooperative mass-murder.\n\nThat it was normal for a father to want to spare his son from the pain\nhe himself had experienced, he knew.  That in some respects it was\nimpossible, and wrong to try, he also realized.  But THIS pain, this\nHell, he wished with every ounce of his being could be spared from all\nthe children of men from now until the end of time.  His one regret was\nthat there wasn't more he could do to work in that direction.  He was\nno politician, could not even take them seriously.....\n\n\"Enemy ships approaching, Colonel.  Ninety-six vessels, mostly\nfighters, fighter-bombers and destroyers, clustered about four light\ncruisers.\"\n\nThese words, and the ensuing battle-tension on the faces around him,\nbrought him sharply back reality.  He moved to stand before the wide\nsweep of glass and look out at the sea of Space before him.  He studied\nthe relatively small force approaching their own, nearly three times as\nstrong.\n\nAnd beyond them, he saw with love and sudden longing the rose and aqua\nhues of Athena.  His home.  And beyond all, the white, crystalline\nstars:  perfect, pure and untouchable, untainted by the follies of men.\n\n\"Not much of a force,\" said Liebenstein to his exec.  \"And why give\nbattle so far beyond the grids?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's only a feint,\" replied the other.\n\n\"Forgive me, Colonel,\" put in Brunner, turning.  \"But I believe they\nmean to give only mock battle and then fire out into warp.  It would\nalso explain.....\"\n\n\"Thank you, Captain, that will be more than enough.\"  Liebenstein knew\nthis as well as he, but had wanted to keep the edge of hardness and\nkeen  attention among his officers.  \"Very well, Muller.  Order the\nfleet to spread out, and engage if he's willing.\"\n\nSeeing with his now practiced eye what was unfolding before him,\nBrunner felt real hope rise inside him as it had not done for many\nmonths.  Could it be this easy?  Had his long trials at last been\nrewarded:  to retake his home with so little bloodshed?\n\nThen the journey had brought him full circle.  It was not far from here\nthat Dubcek (the remembrance saddened him, but he pushed on) had stood\nbefore the glass, not so long ago that they had been startled and\nundone by an Enemy that seemed so strong and unassailable, their own\nchances against it, so desperate and hopeless.  Yet somehow they had\nfound a way.  And now.....\n\nHis assumptions had been correct.  After scarcely twelve minutes of\nhalf-hearted fighting, the Alliance vessels began to move off and fire\ninto light-speed.  And he sensed also that this was not at all what\ntheir High Command had intended.  Some Belgian or Swiss general had\nmercifully disobeyed orders, and given up the colonies with only mock\nresistance.  He looked up again at Athena, and now nothing stood\nbetween him and that beautiful orb, filled with life.  His HOME\n\nThere came the sound of cheering and fraternal congratulation all\naround him, but he heard none of it.  He was completely isolated within\nhis own emotions.\n\nAt first he could feel nothing but child-like joy, and a blissful\nrelease from care and tension.  This feeling grew, and deepened, until\nhe felt himself to be standing atop a high pinnacle, looking down on a\nvast panorama of mountain, clouds and snow, at other peaks, and other\nconquerors like himself.  But in that moment none stood so high as he,\nand his heart swelled to bursting with pride and gratitude, and love\nfor all men.\n\nHe was home!  It was over.  He had WON.\n\nBut then as this elation, almost sexual, faded, he grew thoughtful and\nmore deeply introspective.  And though he tried to stop them, or at\nleast soften them with thoughts of his present happiness, memories\nbegan to come back to him of the sorrow and suffering he had seen, and\nof his comrades who had not survived.  And from this same lofty\npinnacle, he saw with new and vivid bitterness the full insanity of war.\n\nAfter all that---all the fighting, the hanging on, the despair and true\nheroism, hearts breaking and breaking through.....  This plethora of\nhuman passions, pushed to their utmost limit, had not worked miracles\nof unification and achievement, or even brought men to a new\nunderstanding.  There was nothing positive in any of it.  All the\nbattles, death and anguish, had not paid their awful price for good,\nbut merely to resist an evil, and restore things to the way they had\nalready been.\n\nHow could anyone rejoice and claim victory?  He saw then with\nmelancholy and absolute certainty that no nation anywhere, ever, gained\nanything lasting from such a war.  And though a personal victory might\nbe won, on any national or international scale this was impossible.\nHuman nature was not changed, and the seeds and roots of the scattered\nweeds were not eradicated, but merely remained beneath the surface,\nawaiting their chance to rise and reek havoc again.\n\nAnd the spiritual quota was not even returned to its original starting\npoint.  Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children were dead,\nmany more wounded, maimed, bereft or displaced.  And for WHAT?\n\nNothing had changed.\n\nNothing had been accomplished.\n\nAnd nothing was the same.\n\nHe felt a hand on his shoulder, whirled angrily.  Seeing before him the\nfamiliar face of Eric Dobler, a destroyer captain formerly under his\ncommand, he tried to relax his features and his mind.  But seeing the\nrestive sorrow in the other's face, he suddenly felt a new sense of\ncare and alarm.\n\n\"What is it, Eric?  What's wrong?\"\n\n...  \"Your brother is dead.  He kept asking for you, but there was no\ntime.\"\n\nBrunner's mouth worked, but no sounds would emerge.\n\n\"He asked me to give you a message.  To say.....  He tried to be like\nyou.  That he was sorry.  Sorry he had failed.....  He couldn't hold\nthem off.\"\n\nBrunner hung his head in agony and shame.  And the words of Joseph\nConrad sprang, so easily to his mind, seeming to sum up perfectly this\nbrutal sham of Man's creation.  DEAR GOD.\n\n\"The horror!  The horror!\"\n\nAnd the tears that his wife was so fond of, trickled bitterly down his\ncheek.\n\n\n\n\n\n........................................................................\n..............................\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNIEMAN\n\n\nNieman stood leaning over the main ship's console, the sharp lines of\nits blues, greens and whites reflected in his face.  His lean, strong\nbody was wrapped in celluloid black.  The face too was hard and sharp,\naged beyond illusion but not desire, eyes taut like those of a man with\na squadron behind him and no fear of death ahead, but only a smoldering\nanger that had displaced all other emotion.  And emptiness.  A fleet of\nrobot ships---that was enough.\n\nOmega V was gone.  Without reason, without warning, an entire system.\nA synthetic sun that was supposed to last a billion years.  While he\nwas away fighting for the lives of others.....  He had never trusted\nthe Guardians, though the soft and protected Commonwealth did; and now\nhe would ram it down their throats.  Spirit beings!  The space they\noccupied was real enough---the silver threads like a massive,\ngeometrical spider's web encircling the Hole in Space, the white globes\npulsing across them.  Hole in Space.  That was what THEY called it.  An\nimmense dark clot in the sky, so black, with no stars behind it.  He\nwould see how untouchable they were.\n\nHis hatred had had four long years to smolder.  The year of isolation\nhad been longest, training himself to feel nothing, in the face of\ndanger.  Even the fourteen odd months of pirating had crawled---the\nkilling of his crew had been a sad necessity.  Then the slow,\nmeticulous construction of the fleet.  Human minds were worthless here;\nthey would only be read and turned to jelly with strange fears and\nfalse images.  Only a close-knit, automatic response to telepathic\ncommand, forty fast-black robot ships, were of any use.  Why he had\nchosen black he couldn't say, unless perhaps it was a gut feeling they\ndidn't like it.  But the Hole was black.....  STOP THESE USELESS\nTHOUGHTS!  NEXT YOU'LL BE THINKING OF MARIA.\n\nIt was not possible they weren't aware of his opposition.  But they\nseemed to allow such things. . .or perhaps they couldn't stop them.\nNo, that was too much to ask himself to believe.  Certainly no one had\nstopped the fascist uprising, the snowballing of events which had led\nto interworld war, the slaughter, the death camps.  True the\nCommonwealth had eventually come to grips.  But the destruction, the\nloss of life, could never be justified.  So much for Divine\nintervention.\n\nHe had to start closing down his mind, as he had taught himself through\nthe years of emptiness.  He wasn't sure how greatly distance mattered,\nbut he was getting close.  Already the shimmering outline could be seen\non the monitor, the bright specks of racing white.  From here the\nblackness beyond did not seem so dark.  But soon it would be Darkness\nitself, enveloping the sky.  It was for the heart of the blackness he\naimed.  Perhaps it was their only vulnerable point, they guarded it so\nwell.  He looked up at the wide portal, and as he expected the visions\nhad begun.  A long chute, a cylindrical spiraling of gray and glossy\nskulls.\n\nHe looked away, then remembered.  Shook his head sardonically and\ntightened his face.  The images weren't outside, they were inside.  He\nstood atop a geyser of emerald fire.  But they couldn't stop his\nthoughts.  \"Central computer, phase three,\" he just managed.  Now\nunless his commands were coded and specific the ships would not\nrespond.  He felt his own surge forward, felt the sharp jolt of\nelectric current as for a moment his wired throat cleared the images\naway.\n\n\"Bastards!\"  He could see them now, closer, breaking away from the\nstrands and coming at him like miniature suns.  He felt them probing\nthe mechanized brain.  \"One-nine three-nine!\"  And the unreal minds all\nfunctioned in a different key.  He managed to fire three burst from the\nleft wing before his fingers turned to lizards and were gone.\n\n\"AAHH!\"  Another shock, stronger, and he could see again.  He was\ncloser still, the web becoming an expanding grid pocked with dark and\ngeometric holes.  His ships crossed and interwove, fired a massive\nburst.  The globes hovered and sometimes blinded him with light, but\neither could not or would not attack the ships.  Their shields were up,\nbut how much that mattered.....\n\nThen his fleet was gone, as if it had never been, and the globes\nreceded.  A harder jolt, but somehow he knew this was no illusion.  All\nfalse images faded.  He was himself, without pain, in his own vessel.\nAnd the grid was still larger, the growing blackness like wet and\nphysical night behind it.\n        His hands were back on the console and he fired seven bursts,\nat the racing globes or at the shafts themselves.  But each time he\nfired into nothingness:  the lines of brilliance were no longer there.\nAbove, to the side, but not there.  And this too was no illusion.  He\nhurled his rage at nothing and no one.\n\nSuddenly a huge black hexagon was before him.\n\nFear.\n\nHis mind began to signal reverse thrust, and only a supreme effort of\nwill overrode it.  The blackness he headed toward.....  Why did it\nterrify him so?  It was as Fear itself.  And suddenly the looming shaft\nabove him appeared not as a barrier, but as the strand of a protective\nnet which covered a great abyss, a hole in living Space.  And he was\nfalling through.\n\n\"No!\"  He could not turn back now!  This was why he had come.  He would\ndestroy them.  Somehow!  This had to be the key.  But they no longer\nseemed an enemy and this silent, screaming void was no friend.  Was it\nyet too late.....\n\n\"NO!\"  He was inside.\n\n\n*\n\n\nIt was cold in that place, through the ship and through the celluloid,\nand the last thing he saw as he looked back through the monitor was a\ntightening circle of black, like a swirl of inky cloud, enveloping the\nGuardians' web.\n\nThen all was dark, but for a sickly and sporadic flashing of the\nconsole.  He felt a kind of dull dread, a physical weakness, but not\nyet fear.  He had pierced all barriers, and stood at the heart of the\nnightmare.\n\nOnly he could not remember why he had come.  No, he remembered.  But it\ndid not seem like much of a reason.  \"Guardians!\"  His rage would not\nfire in that place, and the screaming hurt his throat.  As the silence\nhurt his ears.\n\nThe ship's momentum had begun to deteriorate, as if such principles did\nnot apply here.  This did not startle him.  It seemed almost doubly\nfamiliar.  But then the outer hull began to deteriorate as well---he\ncould feel it.  \"It isn't possible.\"  The shields were down, this he\nknew, but the vessel's outer skin was of pure platinated osmodidium,\nseven times descended from stainless steel.  It resisted heat,\nfriction, impact and atmosphere.  But in that cold wet nothing it\ntinged and flaked as if with rust, was pocked and threw out buds like a\nface torn by a shotgun.  It broke down, came apart, and fell away all\naround him, leaving him naked and without a ship.\n\nHe stood alone in the black without protection.  The celluloid and\nwires were all that remained---why he couldn't say.  For a time his\nbody was suspended, and his feet danced like those of a marionette\ntrying to find the stage.  Then they touched bottom on something very\nhard and smooth.  A wide stair.  He began to feel suffocated, knew\nthere was no oxygen but this wasn't why.  He took a step forward, up\nanother, and the feeling eased, if only slightly.  He was as a shark\nthat could never sleep.  Unless it kept moving, he would die.\n\nHe continued to climb, as the steps got steeper, which was very soon.\nThey were taller, progressing, and he labored on and it was harder and\nharder to breathe.  Finally the stairs were eight feet high and he\ncould go no further.  He was almost weeping, feeling lost, when he went\nto lean against the obstructing wall before him.  But it was gone, and\nhe fell forward into grey mists.\n\nHe stumbled to the rocky ground---the rocks were red---and he found\nhimself in a deep chasm lit and shadowed by a pale sun in a purple sky.\n Looking up he saw an ancient and abandoned stone fortress upon the\nheights to his left, with tattered streams of white flying distended\ncircles about it and a sound like the wind wailing but there was no\nwind.  The air was thin and weak.\n\nHe suddenly felt exposed there, and sought shelter from the wraiths\nabove among the overhung shadows of the left-hand wall.  He hunched to\na leaning sit and tried to think very carefully.\n\nHe understood.  This was his past, and he knew what must be done.  A\nbeautiful and wistful woman was imprisoned there, in that place, and he\nwould have her as his own at all costs.  And for the first time he felt\nhis aggression not as a flaw, a defense against the void, but as a\nrightness and a strength, because he knew she needed him.  So he stayed\nvery still and waited for the darkness of night.  Not that this would\nblind their sight but because he felt safer in the dark, though not the\nblack.  So as the sky lost red and reached its deepest blue, he set out.\n\nHe moved out from the overhang to a narrow vertical slit, a long scar\nin the rockface.  He climbed slowly and determinedly, sure of each step\nand never making a sound.  He reached and sweated and pulled, till he\nwas nearly halfway up.\n\nThen suddenly the wraiths were aware of him and streaked down from the\nhigh walls with a shrieking wail that was horrible to hear.  They\nreached him, swirled about him and gnashed their sharp teeth from\nmouths that were like bats' mouths and screamed their terrible scream.\nHe reached with one arm to ward them off, nearly fell.  He found his\ngrip and seized a stone and hurled it at the nearest.  It went clean\nthrough, and he nearly fell again.\n\nBut then, as he hung by one hand, vulnerable, the screaming increased\nand they came closer but did not finish him.  Then he realized that\nthey could not.  They were as fear, and could not physically harm him,\nbut only make him do the things to harm himself.  So he cautiously\nrecovered himself, stood firmly on the tiny ledge, and put them from\nhis mind.  There might be other obstacles to reach her, but these he\nwould not fear.\n\nHe reached up and continued to climb as the noise died away and only a\nghost image of the wraiths remained frozen in the air.  Climbing\nsteadily, he had almost reached a level with the first buttress---one\nlast knot of stone---when a low studded door burst open from the\ndarkness of the wall to the extreme right, and four black wolves poured\nout and rushed headlong toward the place where he would emerge above\nthe cliffs, and he was hard pressed to reach it before they did.\n\nThese were no illusion.  He leapt to his feet and pulled the long knife\nfrom its sheath as the first was upon him.  One back-slash with the\nblade as he dropped to a knee and it fell dying before him, its throat\ncut.  The others closed as he rose again and they snarled and tore as\nhe kicked and slashed, and after a time two more were dead but his legs\nwere badly marked and it was hard to stand, and he fell to the ground.\n\nThen the last, the largest, which had bided its time was upon him,\ngoing for his throat.  The knife had fallen away and he reached up with\nhis hands to grab it around the neck and try to pull it off.  He\nsucceeded partially, raising himself halfway; but it was soon at him\nagain, tearing at the side of his face.  Driven by an overpowering\nrage, he seized it just below the ear and dragged it away until he had\nits neck firmly in his two hands, and squeezed and kicked until the\nwolf moved no more.  He let it fall to the ground as he rose, and\nsullenly brushed the dirt from him and strained his eyes to focus on\nthe dark castle before him.\n\nThere was only one entrance, near to the small door which had emitted\nthe wolves, locked tight upon their demise.  There it was:  a vast arch\nguarded by a spiked portcullis.  To his amazement as he came forward he\nsaw that the grid was raised, the way open.\n\nHe stepped toward it cautiously, came to it, looked about him for some\nkind of trap.  But he found none, passed through and entered a long\ncorridor, which led in time to a double-door upon his right.  He\nentered a broad chamber of half-light, knowing he had reached the heart\nof the Castle.  He entered.\n\nA lone figure sat in a heavy throne at its head, a circled fire to one\nside, an enormous leopard chained to an iron ring on the other.  Six\ndoors stood silent at the back of the chamber.\n\n\"Hello Nieman,\" said the bald figure from its throne.  The firelight\ndistorted his features, but the fat and sneering visage would have been\nugly in any light.  He wore a mantle of crimson, edged in gold.\n\n\"Where is she?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Not so fast,\" spoke the other calmly.  \"I am not a person to offend.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid of you.\"\n\nThe mouth gave a dry, humorless laugh.  \"Do you know who I am?\"  He\ntwisted a ring around his fat finger with the opposite hand.\n\n\"I know what you're called,\" retorted Nieman, his anger growing.  \"The\nancients called you daemon.  Religious fools say you're the Devil.\"\n\n\"And what do you say?\"  It turned the ring more quickly.\n\n\"That you don't exist.  I am talking to myself.\"  He looked to the row\nof doors, tried to feel her presence among the stone.  He stepped\ntoward the second in line.\n\n\"Stop!\" cried the visage, which he ignored.  He pulled open the door as\nthe great cat broke free of its chains and came after him.  It rushed\nand leapt full in his face.  But he had turned; he caught it in mid-air\nand hurled it against the wall.  It gave a cry of pain and alarm,\ncrashed to the floor senseless, where he left it.  He was tired of\nkilling.\n\n\"Fool!\" cried the god.  \"Do you still doubt me?\"\n\n\"The servant is real but the master a dream.\"  He paid no further\nattention as the visage dissolved into excrement.  But the fire\nremained.\n\nThe way before him was too dark to see, so he went back to the entrance\nand pulled a torch from its mount just inside the arch.  He returned to\nthe door, and looked inside.\n\nHe entered a shallow stone hallway which ended in a tight spiral of\nstairs, leading downward.  His torch was the only light.  He descended\nslowly, the way cramped and his legs tight and bleeding, and after\nperhaps three hundred steps came upon a long catacomb, which he entered\nfrom a recessed hole in its side.  The way was thick with webs which he\nbrushed aside with is free hand, as he stepped out silently into the\nendless row of tombs.\n\nShe had to be there, somewhere:  the way the shadows played upon the\nwalls, the branching crypts and long row of stone caskets.  The way his\nshadow-self stalked behind him, so tall.\n\nHe walked a long way, silent but for the sounds of his moving, then\nheard something like a faint groan of pain, unmistakably feminine, to\nhis left and a short way ahead.  He moved towards it, thrust the torch\nahead of him and into a high, wide antechamber like a small cathedral,\nseveral caskets deep.  He heard the sound again, this time a cry of\nterror and alarm, and strained his eyes to see.  He moved closer,\nwedged the torch between two caskets and looked to the front of the\nchamber.\n\nAnd there she was, the love of his life:  above an altar, mounted\nhalfway up the wall behind it, spread like a crucifix, arms and legs\nbound by iron shackles, garment torn, a hideous mask covering her face\nand spreading out in huge lizard's fins an arm's length wide.  Only her\neyes were visible, wide with terror, pleading against the act sure to\ncome.\n\n\"Please, no.  No. . .God.  Please, I beg you.  Please.\"  And she lost\nall control and wept bitterly.  He lowered his head, his heart torn\napart.\n\n\"Don't cry, I won't hurt you.\"  He stumbled for words, inadequate.  \"I\nhaven't come to hurt you, I swear it.....  By everything that is and\nisn't sacred I make this vow:  that I will be to you whatever you need\nme to be, that I will never leave you, and that the day I knowingly\ncause you pain I will be the instrument of my own destruction.  Please,\ndon't cry.\"\n\nHe felt the tears pushing at his eyes, but would not leave her there a\nmoment longer.  He shook off emotion, climbed onto the altar and lifted\nthe heavy mask from its hook above her head, set it quietly beside him.\n\nHer deep, gentle face looked out at him with disbelieving gratitude and\nlove.  It was cut in several places from the short spikes which lined\nthe inside of the mask; but as she had remained very still the damage\nwas not deep.  He found an iron bar leaned against the ground,\nremounted the altar and began to pry away the rusted bands.  It was not\npossible to do so without hurting her, but she bit her lip and endured\nthe pain.\n\nAnd as the last shackle came off her wrist she slid into his arms.  And\nsuddenly she knew him, and trusted him, and he embraced her heavily,\nweeping.  She returned the affection weakly, touching the back of his\nneck with her fingers.  He had never felt this way, nor ever thought he\ncould.  The tears would not stop.\n\n\"I'm so glad I found you,\" he stammered.  \"Dear God, I'm glad.  What\nif.....  What if I had never found you?\"  He stepped back, and an\nincomprehensible horror engulfed him.\n\nThe words echoed all around him, down the row of tombs, endless.\n\n\"Never found you.  Never found you.  Never found.....\"  And with a\nsudden fearful burst like the realization of death, he remembered.\nRemembered where he was, and understood.  Dear God, he understood.\n\nShe slipped back out of his grasp as darkness poured into the room.\nLike reverse action she was back upon the wall, the iron hoops\nreplacing themselves.  The mask was up and she was crying.  Her blood\nflowed gently down the spikes.\n\n\"NO!\"\n\nBut the room began to spin, to break into fragments, and she was gone.\nHe floated again in the cold wet nothing, the world without order or\nhope.  He shrank into a weeping ball and clutched his head with his\nhands, lost as he had never been lost.\n\nBut then to his bewilderment, he began to feel a weight of substance\naround him, a materializing structure:  his ship was coming back.  A\nfloor, walls, then the hull returned, and he knelt in the familiar\ncontrol room, looking up at the monitor.  The inky black was patching,\nbroke, and he could see the outline of a vast web.  This time he did\nnot fight as the ship drew closer, and closer still.  A great silver\nshaft was above him. . .and he emerged once more into the present,\nliving, and unchangeable world.\n\n\n*\n\n\nAt a distance of two hundred miles he turned his ship around, back to\nface the Guardians.  There the vessel stood still in Space, as a single\nglobe approached him from out of the glowing network.  It came very\nclose, filling all the screen, but was silent.  Thinking it a\nmessenger, he addressed it with words.\n\n\"All right,\" he said, broken at the last.  \"All right, you helped me\nfind her.  The one miracle of my life.  I am grateful.\"  The white\nsphere did not react.  \"But if you have that power, then you could have\nsaved her life.....  No.  I left her.\"  The realization staggered him.\n\"I.....  But now I have learned.  I respect you.  Bring her back.\nPlease. . .bring her back.\"  He began to sob without tears.\n\n\"PLEASE.\"\n\nAt that moment the sphere glowed with a blinding light.  It might have\nbeen an unreadable message.  It might have been a warning, or a gesture\nof peace.  But whatever it was or was not, it remained beyond human\nunderstanding.  It could not change the past or help him now.\n\nAs the globe receded he turned the ship again, bewildered, and flew\ntoward unfamiliar stars.\n\n\nThe End\n\n\nwww.aragornbooks.com\n\n\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\n\nChristopher Leadem was born in Arlington, Virginia in 1956, the second\nson of an Air Force Intelligence officer and a schoolteacher. Shortly\nafter his birth, his father transferred to the Central Intelligence\nAgency, and the young family moved frequently.\n\nLeadem's primary education was in Catholic schools, where he earned the\nreputation of a gifted student. Attending public high school in Bucks\nCounty, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of James Michener, he displayed a\ntalent for writing, and a love of history and science. At the age of\nfourteen, he saw a short film by Ray Bradbury about the life of a\nwriter, which galvanized his desire to be an author himself.\n\nBurned out by a stifling high school environment, he did not\nimmediately attend college, but launched headlong into his writing.\nThis began with a spiritual novel, \"In Search of the Evermore,\" whose\nlength and sweeping scope proved too difficult for a first attempt.\n\nHe then attended Penn State and the University of Colorado, excelling\nat English Literature. He resumed his writing career and completed his\nfirst novel, \"Within a Crimson Circle,\" at the age of 22. He has since\ncompleted five other novels, five volumes of poetry and nine\nscreenplays. Three other novels are in progress.\n\nHe currently lives in Colorado with his three children.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OBERHEIM (VOICES)***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 13841.txt or 13841.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/3/8/4/13841\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
