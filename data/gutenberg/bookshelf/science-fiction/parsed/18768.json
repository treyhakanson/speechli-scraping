By the power of the true name be summoned cells and\nhumors, ka and id, self and--\"\n\nDave Hanson! The name came swimming through utter blackness, sucking at\nhim, pulling him together out of nothingness. Then, abruptly, he was\naware of being alive, and surprised. He sucked in on the air around him,\nand the breath burned in his lungs. He was one of the dead--there should\nbe no quickening of breath within him!\n\nHe caught a grip on himself, fighting the fantasies of his mind, and\ntook another breath of air. This time it burned less, and he could force\nan awareness of the smells around him. But there was none of the pungent\nodor of the hospital he had expected. Instead, his nostrils were\nscorched with a noxious odor of sulfur, burned hair and cloying incense.\n\nHe gagged on it. His diaphragm tautened with the sharp pain of\nlong-unused muscles, and he sneezed.\n\n\"A good sign,\" a man's voice said. \"The followers have accepted and are\nleaving. Only a true being can sneeze. But unless the salamander works,\nhis chances are only slight.\"\n\nThere was a mutter of agreement from others, before an older voice broke\nin. \"It takes a deeper fire than most salamanders can stir, Ser Perth.\nWe might aid it with high-frequency radiation, but I distrust the\neffects on the prepsyche. If we tried a tamed succubus--\"\n\n\"The things are untrustworthy,\" the first voice answered. \"And with the\nsky falling, we dare not trust one.\"\n\nThe words blurred off in a fog of semiconsciousness and half-thoughts.\nThe sky was falling? Who killed Foxy Loxy? I, said the spider, who sat\ndown insider, I went boomp in the night and the bull jumped over the\nmoon....\n\n\"Bull,\" he croaked. \"The bull sleeper!\"\n\n\"Delirious,\" the first voice muttered.\n\n\"I mean--bull pusher!\" That was wrong, too, and he tried again, forcing\nhis reluctant tongue around the syllables. \"Bull _dosser_!\"\n\nDamn it, couldn't he even pronounce simple Engaliss?\n\nThe language wasn't English, however. Nor was it Canadian French, the\nonly other speech he could make any sense of. Yet he understood it--had\neven spoken it, he realized. There was nothing wrong with his command of\nwhatever language it was, but there seemed to be no word for bulldozer.\nHe struggled to get his eyes open.\n\nThe room seemed normal enough, in spite of the odd smells. He lay on a\nhigh bed, surrounded by prim white walls, and there was even a chart of\nsome kind at the bottom of the bedframe. He focused his eyes slowly on\nwhat must be the doctors and nurses there, and their faces looked back\nwith the proper professional worry. But the varicolored gowns they wore\nin place of proper clothing were covered with odd designs, stars,\ncrescents and things that might have been symbols for astronomy or\nchemistry.\n\nHe tried to reach for his glasses to adjust them. There were no glasses!\nThat hit him harder than any other discovery. He must be delirious and\nimagining the room. Dave Hanson was so nearsighted that he couldn't\nhave seen the men, much less the clothing, without corrective lenses.\n\nThe middle-aged man with the small mustache bent over the chart near his\nfeet. \"Hmm,\" the man said in the voice of the first speaker. \"Mars\ntrines Neptune. And with Scorpio so altered ... hmm. Better add two cc.\nof cortisone to the transfusion.\"\n\nHanson tried to sit up, but his arms refused to bear his weight. He\nopened his mouth. A slim hand came to his lips, and he looked up into\nsoothing blue eyes. The nurse's face was framed in copper-red hair. She\nhad the transparent skin and classic features that occur once in a\nmillion times but which still keep the legend of redheaded enchantresses\nalive. \"Shh,\" she said.\n\nHe began to struggle against her hand, but she shook her head gently.\nHer other hand began a series of complicated motions that had a\nritualistic look about them.\n\n\"Shh,\" she repeated. \"Rest. Relax and sleep, Dave Hanson, and remember\nwhen you were alive.\"\n\nThere was a sharp sound from the doctor, but it began to blur out before\nHanson could understand it. He fought to remember what he'd heard the\nnurse say--something about when he was alive--as if he'd been dead a\nlong time.... He couldn't hold the thought. At a final rapid motion of\nthe girl's hand his eyes closed, the smell faded from his nose and all\nsounds vanished. Once there was a stinging sensation, as if he were\nreceiving the transfusion. Then he was alone in his mind with his\nmemories--mostly of the last day when he'd still been alive. He seemed\nto be reliving the events, rethinking the thoughts he'd had then.\n\nIt began with the sight of his uncle's face leering at him. Uncle David\nArnold Hanson looked like every man's dream of himself and every woman's\ndreams of manliness. But at the moment, to Dave, he looked more like a\npersonal demon. His head was tilted back and nasty laughter was booming\nthrough the air of the little office.\n\n\"So your girl writes that your little farewell activity didn't fare so\nwell, eh?\" he chortled. \"And you come crawling here to tell me you want\nto do the honorable thing, is that it? All right, my beloved nephew,\nyou'll do the honorable thing! You'll stick to your contract with me.\"\n\n\"But--\" Dave began.\n\n\"But if you don't, you'd better read it again. You don't get one cent\nexcept on completion of your year with me. That's what it says, and\nthat's what happens.\" He paused, letting the fact that he meant it sink\nin. He was enjoying the whole business, and in no hurry to end it. \"And\nI happen to know, Dave, that you don't even have fare to Saskatchewan\nleft. You quit and I'll see you never get another job. I promised my\nsister I'd make a man of you and, by jumping Jupiter, I intend to do\njust that. And in my book, that doesn't mean you run back with your tail\nbetween your legs just because some silly young girl pulls that old\nchestnut on you. Why, when I was your age, I already had....\"\n\nDave wasn't listening any longer. In futile anger, he'd swung out of the\noffice and gone stumbling back toward the computer building. Then, in a\nfurther burst of anger, he swung off the trail. To hell with his work\nand blast his uncle! He'd go on into town, and he'd--he'd do whatever he\npleased.\n\nThe worst part of it was that Uncle David could make good on his threat\nof seeing that Dave got no more work anywhere. David Arnold Hanson was a\npower to reckon with. No other man on Earth could have persuaded anyone\nto let him try his scheme of building a great deflection wall across\nnorthern Canada to change the weather patterns. And no other man could\nhave accomplished the impossible task, even after twelve countries\npooled their resources to give him the job. But he was doing it, and it\nwas already beginning to work. Dave had noticed that the last winter in\nChicago had definitely shown that Uncle David's predictions were coming\ntrue.\n\nLike most of the world, Dave had regarded the big man who was his uncle\nwith something close to worship. He'd jumped at the chance to work under\nUncle David. And he'd been a fool. He'd been doing all right in Chicago.\nRepairing computers didn't pay a fortune, but it was a good living, and\nhe was good at it. And there was Bertha--maybe not a movie doll, but a\nsort of pretty girl who was also a darned good cook. For a man of thirty\nwho'd always been a scrawny, shy runt like the one in the \"before\"\npictures, he'd been doing all right.\n\nThen came the letter from his uncle, offering him triple salary as a\nmaintenance man on the computers used for the construction job. There\nwas nothing said about romance and beauteous Indian maids, but Dave\nfilled that in himself. He would need the money when he and Bertha got\nmarried, too, and all that healthy outdoor living was just what the\ndoctor would have ordered.\n\nThe Indian maids, of course, turned out to be a few fat old squaws who\nknew all about white men. The outdoor living developed into five months\nof rain, hail, sleet, blizzard, fog and constant freezing in tractors\nwhile breathing the healthy fumes of diesels. Uncle David turned out to\nbe a construction genius, all right, but his interest in Dave seemed to\nlie in the fact that he was tired of being Simon Legree to strangers\nand wanted to take it out on one of his own family. And the easy job\nturned into hell when the regular computer-man couldn't take any more\nand quit, leaving Dave to do everything, including making the field\ntests to gain the needed data.\n\nNow Bertha was writing frantic letters, telling him how much he'd better\ncome back and marry her immediately. And Uncle David thought it was a\njoke!\n\nDave paid no attention to where his feet were leading him, only vaguely\naware that he was heading down a gully below the current construction\njob. He heard the tractors and bulldozers moving along the narrow cliff\nabove him, but he was used to the sound. He heard frantic yelling from\nabove, too, but paid no attention to it; in any Hanson construction\nprogram, somebody was always yelling about something that had to be done\nday before yesterday. It wasn't until he finally became aware of his own\nname being shouted that he looked up. Then he froze in horror.\n\nThe bulldozer was teetering at the edge of the cliff as he saw it, right\nabove him. And the cliff was crumbling from under it, while the tread\nspun idiotically out of control. As Dave's eyes took in the whole\nsituation, the cliff crumbled completely, and the dozer came lunging\nover the edge, plunging straight for him. His shout was drowned in the\nroar of the motor. He tried to force his legs to jump, but they were\nfrozen in terror. The heavy mass came straight for him, its treads\nchurning like great teeth reaching for him.\n\nThen it hit, squarely on top of him. Something ripped and splattered and\nblacked out in an unbearable welter of agony.\n\nDave Hanson came awake trying to scream and thrusting at the bed with\narms too weak to raise him. The dream of the past was already fading.\nThe horror he had thought was death lay somewhere in the past.\n\nNow he was here--wherever here was.\n\nThe obvious answer was that he was in a normal hospital, somehow still\nalive, being patched up. The things he seemed to remember from his other\nwaking must be a mixture of fact and delirium. Besides, how was he to\njudge what was normal in extreme cases of surgery?\n\nHe managed to struggle up to a sitting position in the bed, trying to\nmake out more of his surroundings. But the room was dark now. As his\neyes adjusted, he made out a small brazier there, with a cadaverous old\nman in a dark robe spotted with looped crosses. On his head was\nsomething like a miter, carrying a coiled brass snake in front of it.\nThe old man's white goatee bobbed as he mouthed something silently and\nmade passes over the flame, which shot up prismatically. Clouds of white\nfire belched up.\n\nDave reached to adjust his glasses, and found again that he wasn't\nwearing them. But he'd never seen so clearly before.\n\nAt that moment, a chanting voice broke into his puzzled thoughts. It\nsounded like Ser Perth. Dave turned his head weakly. The motion set sick\nwaves of nausea running through him, but he could see the doctor\nkneeling on the floor in some sort of pantomime. The words of the chant\nwere meaningless.\n\nA hand closed over Dave's eyes, and the voice of the nurse whispered in\nhis ear. \"Shh, Dave Hanson. It's the Sather Karf, so don't interrupt.\nThere may be a conjunction.\"\n\nHe fell back, panting, his heart fluttering. Whatever was going on, he\nwas in no shape to interrupt anything. But he knew that this was no\ndelirium. He didn't have that kind of imagination.\n\nThe chant changed, after a long moment of silence. Dave's heart had\npicked up speed, but now it missed again, and he felt cold. He shivered.\nHell or heaven weren't like this, either. It was like something out of\nsome picture--something about Cagliostro, the ancient mystic. But he was\nsure the language he somehow spoke wasn't an ancient one. It had words\nfor electron, penicillin and calculus, for he found them in his own\nmind.\n\nThe chant picked up again, and now the brazier flamed a dull red,\nshowing the Sather Karf's face changing from some kind of disappointment\nto a businesslike steadiness. The red glow grew white in the center, and\na fat, worm-like shape of flame came into being. The old man picked it\nup in his hand, petted it and carried it toward Dave. It flowed toward\nhis chest.\n\nHe pulled himself back, but Ser Perth and the nurse leaped forward to\nhold him. The thing started to grow brighter. It shone now like a tiny\nbit of white-hot metal; but the older man touched it, and it snuggled\ndown into Dave's chest, dimming its glow and somehow purring. Warmth\nseemed to flow from it into Dave. The two men watched for a moment, then\npicked up their apparatus and turned to go. The Sather Karf lifted the\nfire from the brazier in his bare hand, moved it into the air and said a\nsoft word. It vanished, and the two men were also gone.\n\n\"Magic!\" Dave said. He'd seen such illusions created on the stage, but\nthere was something different here. And there was no fakery about the\nwarmth from the thing over his chest. Abruptly he remembered that he'd\ncome across something like it, called a salamander, in fiction once;\nthe thing was supposed to be a spirit of fire, and dangerously\ndestructive.\n\nThe girl nodded in the soft glow coming from Dave's chest. \"Naturally,\"\nshe told him. \"How else does one produce and control a salamander,\nexcept by magic? Without, magic, how can we thaw a frozen soul? Or\ndidn't your world have any sciences, Dave Hanson?\"\n\nEither the five months under his uncle had toughened him, or the sight\nof the bulldozer falling had knocked him beyond any strong reaction. The\ngirl had practically told him he wasn't in his own world. He waited for\nsome emotion, felt none, and shrugged. The action sent pain running\nthrough him, but he stood it somehow. The salamander ceased its purring,\nthen resumed.\n\n\"Where in hell am I?\" he asked. \"Or when?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Hell? No, I don't think so. Some say it's Earth and\nsome call it Terah, but nobody calls it Hell. It's--well, it's a\nlong--time, I guess--from when you were. I don't know. In such matters,\nonly the Satheri know. The Dual is closed even to the Seri. Anyhow, it's\nnot your space-time, though some say it's your world.\"\n\n\"You mean dimensional travel?\" Dave asked. He'd seen something about\nthat on a science-fiction television program. It made even time travel\nseem simple. At any event, however, this wasn't a hospital in any sane\nand normal section of Canada during his time, on Earth.\n\n\"Something like that,\" she agreed doubtfully. \"But go to sleep now.\nShh.\" Her hands came up in complicated gestures. \"Sleep and grow well.\"\n\n\"None of that hypnotism again!\" he protested.\n\nShe went on making passes, but smiled on him kindly. \"Don't be\nsuperstitious--hypnotism is silly. Now go to sleep. For me, Dave\nHanson. I want you well and true when you awake.\"\n\nAgainst his will, his eyes closed, and his lips refused to obey his\ndesire to protest. Fatigue dulled his thoughts. But for a moment, he\nwent on pondering. Somebody from the future--this could never be the\npast--had somehow pulled him out just ahead of the accident, apparently;\nor else he'd been deep frozen somehow to wait for medical knowledge\nbeyond that of his own time. He'd heard it might be possible to do that.\n\nIt was a cockeyed future, if this were the future. Still, if scientists\nhad to set up some, sort of a religious mumbo-jumbo....\n\nSickness thickened in him, until he could feel his face wet with\nperspiration. But with it had come a paralysis that left him unable to\nmove or groan. He screamed inside himself.\n\n\"Poor mandrake-man,\" the girl said softly. \"Go back to Lethe. But don't\ncross over. We need you sorely.\"\n\nThen he passed out again.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nWhatever they had done to patch him up hadn't been very successful,\napparently. He spent most of the time in a delirium; sometimes he was\ndead, and there was an ultimate coldness like the universe long after\nthe entropy death. At other times, he was wandering into fantasies that\nwere all horrible. And at all times, even in unconsciousness, he seemed\nto be fighting desperately to keep from falling apart painfully within\nhimself.\n\nWhen he was awake, the girl was always beside him. He learned that her\nname was Nema. Usually there was also the stout figure of Ser Perth.\nSometimes he saw Sather Karf or some other older man working with\nstrange equipment, or with things that looked like familiar hypodermics\nand medical equipment. Once they had an iron lung around him and there\nwas a thin wisp over his face.\n\nHe started to brush it aside, but Nema's hand restrained him. \"Don't\ndisturb the sylph,\" she ordered.\n\nAnother semirational period occurred during some excitement or danger\nthat centered around him. He was still half delirious, but he could see\nmen working frantically to build a net of something around his bed,\nwhile a wet, thick thing flopped and drooled beyond the door, apparently\nimmune to the attacks of the hospital staff. There were shouting orders\ninvolving the undine. The salamander in Dave's chest crept deeper and\nseemed to bleat at each cry of the monstrous thing beyond the door.\n\nSather Karf sat hunched over what seemed to be a bowl of water, paying\nno attention to the struggle. Something that he seemed to see there held\nhis attention. Then he screamed suddenly.\n\n\"The Sons of the Egg. It's their sending!\"\n\nHe reached for a brazier beside him, caught up the fire and plunged it\ndeep into the bowl of water, screaming something. There was the sound of\nan explosion from far away as he drew his hands out, unwet by the water.\nAbruptly the undine began a slow retreat. In Dave's chest, the\nsalamander began purring again, and he drifted back into his coma.\n\nHe tried to ask Nema about it later when she was feeding him, but she\nbrushed it aside.\n\n\"An orderly let out the news that you are here,\" she said. \"But don't\nworry. We've sent out a doppelganger to fool the Sons, and the orderly\nhas been sentenced to slavery under the pyramid builder for twenty\nlifetimes. I hate my brother! How dare he fight us with the sky\nfalling?\"\n\nLater, the delirium seemed to pass completely, but Dave took no comfort\nfrom that. In its place came a feeling of gloom and apathy. He slept\nmost of the time, as if not daring to use his little strength even to\nthink.\n\nSer Perth stayed near him most of the time now. The man was obviously\nworried, but tried not to show it. \"We've managed to get some\ntestosterone from a blond homunculus,\" he reported. \"That should put you\non your feet in no time. Don't worry, young man we'll keep you vivified\nsomehow until the Sign changes.\" But he didn't sound convincing.\n\n\"Everyone is chanting for you,\" Nema told him. \"All over the world, the\nchants go up.\"\n\nIt meant nothing to him, but it sounded friendly. A whole world hoping\nfor him to get well! He cheered up a bit at that until he found out that\nthe chants were compulsory, and had nothing to do with goodwill.\n\nThe iron lung was back the next time he came to, and he was being tugged\ntoward it. He noticed this time that there was no sylph, and his\nbreathing seemed to be no worse than usual. But the sight of the two\norderlies and the man in medical uniform beside the lung reassured him.\nWhatever their methods, he was convinced that they were doing their best\nfor him here.\n\nHe tried to help them get him into the lung, and one of the men nodded\nencouragingly. But Dave was too weak to give much assistance. He glanced\nabout for Nema, but she was out on one of her infrequent other duties.\nHe sighed, wishing desperately that she were with him. She was a lot\nmore proficient than the orderlies.\n\nThe man in medical robe turned toward him sharply. \"Stop that!\" he\nordered.\n\nBefore Dave could ask what he was to stop, Nema came rushing into the\nroom. Her face paled as she saw the three men, and she gasped, throwing\nup her hand in a protective gesture.\n\nThe two orderlies jumped for her, one grabbing her and the other closing\nhis hands over her mouth. She struggled violently, but the men were too\nstrong for her.\n\nThe man in doctor's robes shoved the iron lung aside violently and\nreached into his clothing. From it, he drew a strange, double-bladed\nknife. He swung toward Dave, raising the knife into striking position\nand aiming it at Dave's heart.\n\n\"The Egg breaks,\" he intoned hollowly. It was a cultured voice, and\nthere was a refinement to his face that registered on Dave's mind even\nover the horror of the weapon. \"The fools cannot hold the shell. But\nneither shall they delay its breaking. Dead you were, mandrake son, and\ndead you shall be again. But since the fault is only theirs, may no ill\ndreams follow you beyond Lethe!\"\n\nThe knife started down, just as Nema managed to break free. She shrieked\nout a phrase of keening command. The salamander suddenly broke from\nDave's chest, glowing brighter as it rose toward the face of the\nattacker. It was like a bit from the center of a star. The man jumped\nback, beginning a frantic ritual. He was too late. The salamander hit\nhim, sank into him and shone through him. Then he slumped, steamed ...\nand was nothing but dust falling toward the carpet. The salamander\nturned, heading toward the others. But it was to Nema it went, rather\nthan the two men. She was trying something desperately, but fear was\nthick on her face, and her hands were unsure.\n\nAbruptly, Sather Karf was in the doorway. His hand lifted, his fingers\ndancing. Words hissed from his lips in a stream of sibilants too quick\nfor Dave to catch. The salamander paused and began to shrink doubtfully.\nSather Karf turned, and again his hands writhed in the air. One hand\ndarted back and forward, as if he were throwing something. Again he made\nthe gesture. With each throw, one of the false orderlies dropped to the\nfloor, clutching at a neck where the skin showed marks of constriction\nas if a steel cord were tightening. They died slowly, their eyes bulging\nand faces turning blue. Now the salamander moved toward them, directed\napparently by slight motions from Sather Karf. In a few moments, there\nwas no sign of them.\n\nThe old man sighed, his face slumping into lines of fatigue and age. He\ncaught his breath. He held out a hand to the salamander, petted it to a\ngentle glow and put it back over Dave's chest.\n\n\"Good work, Nema,\" he said wearily. \"You're too weak to control the\nsalamander, but this was done well in the emergency. I saw them in the\npool, but I was almost too late. The damned fanatics. Superstition in\nthis day and age!\"\n\nHe swung to face Dave, whose vocal cords were still taut with the shock\nof the sight of the knife. \"Don't worry, Dave Hanson. From now on, every\nSer and Sather will protect you with the lower and the upper magic. The\nHouse changes tomorrow, if the sky permits, and we shall shield you\nuntil then. We didn't bring you back from the dead, piecing your\nscattered atoms together with your scattered revenant particle by\nparticle, to have you killed again. Somehow, we'll incarnate you fully!\nYou have my word for that.\"\n\n\"Dead?\" Dave had grown numbed to his past during the long illness, but\nthat brought it back afresh. \"Then I was killed? I wasn't just frozen\nand brought here by some time machine?\"\n\nSather Karf stared at him blankly. \"Time machine? Impossible. Of course\nnot. After the tractor killed you, and you were buried, what good would\nsuch fantasies be, even if they existed? No, we simply reincarnated you\nby pooling our magic. Though it was a hazardous and parlous thing, with\nthe sky falling....\"\n\nHe sighed and went out, while Dave went back to his delirium.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThere was no delirium when he awoke in the morning. Instead, there was\nonly a feeling of buoyant health. In fact, Dave Hanson had never felt\nthat good in his life--or his former life. He reconsidered his belief\nthat there was no delirium, wondering if the feeling were not itself a\nform of hallucination. But it was too genuine. He knew without question\nthat he was well.\n\nIt shouldn't have been true. During the night, he'd partially awakened\nin agony to find Nema chanting and gesturing desperately beside him, and\nhe'd been sure he was on the verge of his second death. He could\nremember one moment, just before midnight, when she had stopped and\nseemed to give up hope. Then she'd braced herself and begun some ritual\nas if she were afraid to try it. Beyond that, he had no memory of pain.\n\nNema came into the room now, touching his shoulder gently. She smiled\nand nodded at him. \"Good morning, Sagittarian. Get out of bed.\"\n\nExpecting the worst, he swung his feet over the side and sat up. After\nso much time in bed, even a well man should be rendered weak and shaky.\nBut there was no dizziness, no sign of weakness. He had made a most\nremarkable recovery, and Nema didn't even seem surprised. He tentatively\ntouched foot to floor and half stood, propping himself against the high\nbed.\n\n\"Come on,\" Nema said impatiently. \"You're all right now. We entered your\nsign during the night.\" She turned her back on him and took something\nfrom a chest beside the bed. \"Ser Perth will be here in a moment. He'll\nwant to find you on your feet and dressed.\"\n\nHanson was beginning to feel annoyance at the suddenly cocksure and\nunsympathetic girl, but he stood fully erect and flexed his muscles.\nThere wasn't even a trace of bedsoreness, though he had been flat on his\nback long enough to grow callouses. And as he examined himself, he could\nfind no scars or signs of injuries from the impact of the bulldozer--if\nthere had ever really been a bulldozer.\n\nHe grimaced at his own doubts. \"Where am I, anyhow, Nema?\"\n\nThe girl dumped an armload of clothing on his bed and looked at him with\ncontrolled exasperation. \"Dave Hanson,\" she told him, \"don't you know\nany other words? That's the millionth time you've asked me that, at\nleast. And for the hundredth time, I'll tell you that you're here. Look\naround you; see for yourself. I'm tired of playing nursemaid to you.\"\nShe picked up a shirt of heavy-duty khaki from the pile on the bed and\nhanded it to him. \"Get into this,\" she ordered. \"Dress first, talk\nlater.\"\n\nShe stalked out of the room.\n\nDave did as she had ordered, busy with his own thoughts as he discovered\nwhat he was to wear. He was still wearing something with a vague\nresemblance to a short hospital gown, with green pentacles and some\nplant symbol woven into it, and with a clasp to hold it together shaped\ninto a silver crux ansata. He took it off and hurled it into a corner\ndisgustedly.\n\nHe picked up the khaki shirt and put it on; then, with growing\ncuriosity, the rest of the garments, until he came to the shoes. Khaki\nshirt, khaki breeches, a wide, webbed belt, a flat-brimmed hat. And the\nshoes--they weren't shoes, but knee-length leather boots, like a dressy\nversion of lumberman's boots or a rougher version of riding boots. He\nhadn't seen even pictures of such things since the few silent movies run\nin some of the little art theaters. He struggled to get them on. They\nwere an excellent fit, and comfortable enough, but he felt as if his\nlegs were encased in hardened concrete when he was through. He looked\ndown at himself in disgust. He was in all respects costumed as the\nepitome of the Hollywood dream of a heroic engineer-builder, ready to\ndrive a canal through an isthmus or throw a dam across a raging\nriver--the kind who'd build the dam while the river raged, instead of\nwaiting until it was quiet, a few days later. He was about as far from\nthe appearance of the actual blue-denim, leather-jacket engineers he had\nworked with as Maori in ancient battle array.\n\nHe shook his head and went looking for the bathroom, where there might\nbe a mirror. He found a door, but it led into a closet, filled with\nalembics and other equipment. There was a mirror hung on the back of it,\nhowever, with a big sign over it that said \"Keep Out.\" He threw the door\nwide and stared at himself. At first, in spite of the costume, he was\npleased. Then the truth began to hit him, and he felt abruptly sure he\nwas still raging with fever and delirium.\n\nHe was still staring when Nema came back into the room. She pursed her\nlips and shut the door quickly. But he'd already seen enough.\n\n\"Never mind where I am,\" he said. \"Tell me, _who_ am I?\"\n\nShe stared at him. \"You're Dave Hanson.\"\n\n\"The hell I am,\" he told her. \"Oh, that's what I remember my father\nhaving me christened as. He hated long names. But take a good look at\nme. I've been shaving my face for years now, and I should know it.\n_That_ face in the mirror wasn't it! There's a resemblance. But a darned\nfaint one. Change the chin, lengthen my nose, make the eyes brown\ninstead of blue, and it might be me. But Dave Hanson's at least five\ninches shorter and fifty pounds lighter, too. Maybe the face is plastic\nsurgery after the accident--but this isn't even my body.\"\n\nThe girl's expression softened. \"I'm sorry, Dave Hanson,\" she said\ngently. \"We should have thought to warn you. You were a difficult\nconjuration--and even the easier ones often go wrong these days. We did\nour best, though it may be that the auspices were too strong on the\nsoma. I'm sorry if you don't like the way you look. But there's nothing\nwe can do about it now.\"\n\nHanson opened the door again, in spite of Nema's quick frown, and looked\nat himself. \"Well,\" he admitted, \"I guess it could be worse. In fact, I\nguess it was worse--once I get used to looking like this, I think I'll\nget to like it. But seeing it was a heck of a thing to take for a sick\nman.\"\n\nNema said sharply, \"Are you sick?\"\n\n\"Well--I guess not.\"\n\n\"Then why say you are? You shouldn't be; I told you we've entered the\nHouse of Sagittarius now. You can't be sick in your own sign. Don't you\nunderstand even that much elementary science?\"\n\nHanson didn't get a chance to answer. Ser Perth was suddenly in the\ndoorway, dressed in a different type of robe. This was short and somehow\nconservative--it had a sincere, executive look about it. The man seemed\nchanged in other ways, too. But Dave wasn't concerned about that. He was\ngrowing tired of the way people suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Maybe\nthey all wore rubber-soled shoes or practiced sneaking about; it was a\nsilly way for grown people to act.\n\n\"Come with me, Dave Hanson,\" Ser Perth ordered, without wasting words.\nHe spoke in a clipped manner now.\n\nDave followed, grumbling in his mind. It was even sillier than their\nsneaking about for them to expect him to start running around before\nthey bothered to check the condition of a man fresh out of his death\nbed. In any of the hospitals he had known, there would have been hours\nor days of X-rays and blood tests and temperature taking before he would\nbe released. These people simply decided a man was well and ordered him\nout.\n\nTo do them justice, however, he had to admit that they seemed to be\nright. He had never felt better. The twaddle about Sagittarius would\nhave to be cleared up sometime, but meanwhile he was in pretty good\nshape. Sagittarius, as he remembered it, was supposed to be one of the\nsigns of the Zodiac. Bertha had been something of a sucker for\nastrology and had found he was born under that sign before she agreed to\ntheir little good-by party. He snorted to himself. It had done her a\nheck of a lot of good, which was to be expected of such nonsense.\n\nThey passed down a dim corridor and Ser Perth turned in at a door.\nInside there was a single-chair barber shop, with a barber who might\nalso have come from some movie-casting office. He had the proper wavy\nblack hair and rat-tailed comb stuck into a slightly dirty off-white\njacket. He also had the half-obsequious, half-insulting manner Dave had\nfound most people expected from their barbers. While he shaved and\ntrimmed Dave, he made insultingly solicitous comments about Dave's skin\nneeding a massage, suggested a tonic for thinning hair and practically\ninsisted on a singe. Ser Perth watched with a mixture of intentness and\namusement. The barber trimmed the tufts from over Dave's ears and\nclipped the hair in his nose, while a tray was pushed up and a\nslatternly blonde began giving him a manicure.\n\nHe began noticing that she carefully dumped his fingernail parings into\na small jar. A few moments later, he found the barber also using a jar\nto collect the hair and shaving stubble. Ser Perth was also interested\nin that, it seemed, since his eyes followed that part of the operation.\nDave frowned, and then relaxed. After all, this was a hospital barber\nshop, and they probably had some rigid rules about sanitation, though he\nhadn't seen much other evidence of such care.\n\nThe barber finally removed the cloth with a snap and bowed. \"Come again,\nsir,\" he said.\n\nSer Perth stood up and motioned for Dave to follow. He turned to look in\na mirror, and caught sight of the barber handing the bottles and jars of\nwaste hair and nail clippings to a girl. He saw only her back, but it\nlooked like Nema.\n\nSomething stirred in his mind then. He'd read something somewhere about\nhair clippings and nail parings being used for some strange purpose. And\nthere'd been something about spittle. But they hadn't collected that. Or\nhad they? He'd been unconscious long enough for them to have gathered\nany amount they wanted. It all had something to do with some kind of\nmumbo-jumbo, and....\n\nSer Perth had led him through the same door by which they'd entered--but\n_not_ into the same hallway. Dave's mind dropped the other thoughts as\nhe tried to cope with the realization that this was another corridor. It\nwas brightly lit, and there was a scarlet carpet on the floor. Also, it\nwas a short hall, requiring only a few steps before they came to a\nbigger door, elaborately enscrolled. Ser Perth bent before it, and the\ndoor opened silently while he and Dave entered.\n\nThe room was large and sparsely furnished. Sitting cross-legged on a\ncushion near the door was Nema, juggling something in her hands. It\nlooked like a cluster of colored threads, partly woven into a rather\ngarish pattern. On a raised bench between two windows sat the old figure\nof Sather Karf, resting his chin on hands that held a staff and staring\nat Dave intently.\n\nDave stopped as the door closed behind him. Sather Karf nodded, as if\nsatisfied, and Nema tied a complex knot in the threads, then paused\nsilently.\n\nSather Karf looked far less well than when Dave had last seen him. He\nseemed older and more shriveled, and there was a querulous, pinched\nexpression in place of the firmness and almost nobility Dave had come to\nexpect. His old eyes bored into the younger man, and he nodded. His\nvoice had a faint quaver now. \"All right. You're not much to look at,\nbut you're the best we could find in the Ways we can reach. Come here,\nDave Hanson.\"\n\nThe command was still there, however petty the man seemed now. Dave\nstarted to phrase some protest, when he found his legs taking him\nforward to stop in front of Sather Karf, like some clockwork man whose\nlever has been pushed. He stood in front of the raised bench, noticing\nthat the spot had been chosen to highlight him in the sunset light from\nthe windows. He listened while the old man talked.\n\nSather Karf began without preamble, stating things in a dry voice as if\nreading off a list of obvious facts.\n\n\"You were dead, Dave Hanson. Dead, buried, and scattered by time and\nchance until even the place where you lay was forgotten. In your own\nworld, you were nothing. Now you are alive, through the effort of men\nhere whose work you could not even dream of. We have created you, Dave\nHanson. Remember that, and forget the ties to any other world, since\nthat world no longer holds you.\"\n\nDave nodded slowly. It was hard to swallow, but there were too many\nthings here that couldn't be in any world he had known. And his memory\nof dying was the clearest memory he had. \"All right,\" he admitted. \"You\nsaved my life--or something. And I'll try to remember it. But if this\nisn't my world, what world is it?\"\n\n\"The only world, perhaps. It doesn't matter.\" The old man sighed, and\nfor a moment the eyes were shrouded in speculation, as if he were\nfollowing some strange by-ways of his own thoughts. Then he shrugged.\n\"It's a world and culture linked to the one you knew only by theories\nthat disagree with each other. And by vision--the vision of those who\nare adept enough to see through the Ways to the branches of Duality.\nBefore me, there was nothing. But I've learned to open a path--a\ndifficult path for one in this world--and to draw from it, as you have\nbeen drawn. Don't try to understand what is a mystery even to the\nSatheri, Dave Hanson.\"\n\n\"A reasonably intelligent man should be able--\" Dave began.\n\nSer Perth cut his words off with a sharp laugh. \"Maybe a man. But who\nsaid you were a man, Dave Hanson? Can't you even understand that? You're\nonly half human. The other half is mandrake--a plant that is related to\nhumanity through shapes and signs by magic. We make simulacra out of\nmandrakes--like the manicurist in the barber shop. And sometimes we use\na mandrake root to capture the essence of a real man, in which case he's\na mandrake-man, like you. Human? No. But a very good imitation, I must\nadmit.\"\n\nDave turned from Ser Perth toward Nema, but her head was bent over the\ncords she was weaving, and she avoided his eyes. He remembered now that\nshe'd called him a mandrake-man before, in a tone of pity. He looked\ndown at his body, sick in his mind. Vague bits of fairy tales came back\nto him, suggesting horrible things about mandrake creatures--zombie-like\nthings, only outwardly human.\n\nSather Karf seemed amused as he looked at Ser Perth. Then the old man\ndropped his eyes toward Dave, and there was a brief look of pity in\nthem. \"No matter, Dave Hanson,\" he said. \"You were human, and by the\npower of your true name, you are still the same Dave Hanson. We have\ngiven you life as precious as your other life. Pay us for that with your\nservice, and that new life will be truly precious. We need your\nservices.\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" Dave asked. He couldn't fully believe what he'd\nheard, but there had been too many strange things to let him disbelieve,\neither. If they had made him a mandrake-man, then by what little he\ncould remember and guess, they could make him obey them.\n\n\"Look out the window--at the sky,\" Sather Karf ordered.\n\nDave looked. The sunset colors were still vivid. He stepped forward and\npeered through the crystalline glass. Before him was a city, bathed in\norange and red, towering like the skyline of a dozen cities he had\nseen--and yet; not like any. The buildings were huge and many-windowed.\nBut some were straight and tall, some were squat and fairy-colored and\nothers blossomed from thin stalks into impossibly bulbous, minareted\ndomes, like long-stemmed tulips reproduced in stone. Haroun-al-Rashid\nmight have accepted the city, but Mayor Wagner could never have believed\nin it.\n\n\"Look at the sky,\" the old man suggested again, and there was no mockery\nin his voice now.\n\nDave looked up obediently.\n\nThe sunset colors were not sunset. The sun was bright and blinding\noverhead, surrounded by reddish clouds, glaring down on the fairy city.\nThe sky was--blotchy. It was daylight, but through the clouds bright\nstars were shining. A corner of the horizon was winter blue; a whole\nsweep of it was dead, featureless black. It was a nightmare sky, an\nimpossible sky. Dave's eyes bulged as he looked at it.\n\nHe turned back to Sather Karf. \"What--what's the matter with it?\"\n\n\"What indeed?\" There was bitterness and fear in the old man's voice. In\nthe corner of the room, Nema looked up for a moment, and there was fear\nand worry in her eyes before she looked back to her weaving of endless\nknots. Sather Karf sighed in weariness. \"If I knew what was happening to\nthe sky, would I be dredging the muck of Duality for the likes of you,\nDave Hanson!\"\n\nHe stood up, wearily but with a certain ease and grace that belied his\nage, looking down at Dave. There was stern command in his words, but a\nhint of pleading in his expression.\n\n\"The sky's falling, Dave Hanson. Your task is to put it together again.\nSee that you do not fail us!\"\n\nHe waved dismissal and Ser Perth led Dave and Nema out.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThe corridor down which they moved this time was one that might have\nbeen familiar even in Dave's Chicago. There was the sound of typewriters\nfrom behind the doors, and the floor was covered with composition tile,\ninstead of the too-lush carpets. He began to relax a little until he\ncame to two attendants busily waxing the floor. One held the other by\nthe ankles and pushed the creature's hairy face back and forth, while\nits hands spread the wax ahead of it. The results were excellent, but\nDave found it hard to appreciate.\n\nSer Perth shrugged slightly. \"They're only mandrakes,\" he explained. He\nthrew open the door of one of the offices and led them through an outer\nroom toward an inner chamber, equipped with comfortable chairs and a\ndesk. \"Sit down, Dave Hanson. I'll fill you in on anything you need to\nknow before you're assigned. Now--the Sather Karf told you what you were\nto do, of course, but--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Dave suggested. \"I don't remember being told any such\nthing.\"\n\nSer Perth looked at Nema, who nodded. \"He distinctly said you were to\nrepair the sky. I've got it down in my notes if you want to see them.\"\nShe extended the woven cords.\n\n\"Never mind,\" Ser Perth said. He twiddled with his mustache. \"I'll recap\na little. Dave Hanson, as you have seen, the sky is falling and must be\nrepaired. You are our best hope. We know that from a prophecy, and it\nis confirmed by the fact that the fanatics of the Egg have tried several\ntimes to kill you. They failed, though one effort was close enough, but\ntheir attempts would not have been made at all if they had not been\nconvinced through their arts that you can succeed with the sky.\"\n\nDave shook his head. \"It's nice to know you trust me!\"\n\n\"Knowing that you _can_ succeed,\" the other went on smoothly, \"we know\nthat you will. It is my unpleasant duty to point out to you the things\nthat will happen if you fail. I say nothing of the fact that you owe us\nyour life; that may be a small enough gift, and one quickly withdrawn. I\nsay only that you have no escape from us. We have your name, and the\ntrue symbol is the thing, as you should know. We also have cuttings from\nyour hair and your beard; we have the parings of your nails, five cubic\ncentimeters of your spinal fluid and a scraping from your liver. We have\nyour body through those, nor can you take it out of our reach. Your name\ngives us your soul.\" He looked at Hanson piercingly. \"Shall I tell you\nwhat it would be like for your soul to live in the muck of a swamp in a\nmandrake root?\"\n\nDave shook his head. \"I guess not. I--look, Ser Perth. I don't know what\nyou're talking about. How can I go along with you when I'm in the dark?\nStart at the beginning, will you? I was killed; all right, if you say I\nwas, I was. You brought me to life again with a mandrake root and\nspells; you can do anything you want with me. I admit it; right now,\nI'll admit anything you want me to, because you know what's going on and\nI don't. But what's all this business of the sky falling? If it is and\ncan be falling, what's the difference? If there is a difference, why\nshould I be able to do anything about it?\"\n\n\"Ignorance!\" Ser Perth murmured to himself. He sighed heavily. \"Always\nignorance. Well, then, listen.\" He sat down on the corner of the desk\nand took out a cigarette. At least it looked like a cigarette. He\nsnapped his fingers and lighted it from a little flame that sprang up,\nblowing clouds of bright green smoke from his mouth. The smoke hung\nlazily, drifting into vague patterns and then began to coalesce into a\ngreen houri without costume. He swatted at it negligently.\n\n\"Dratted sylphs. There's no controlling the elementals properly any\nmore.\" He didn't seem too displeased, however, as he watched the thing\ndance off. Then he sobered.\n\n\"In your world, Dave Hanson, you were versed in the engineering\narts--you more than most. That you should be so ignorant, though you\nwere considered brilliant is a sad commentary on your world. But no\nmatter. Perhaps you can at least learn quickly still. Even you must have\nhad some idea of the composition of the sky?\"\n\nDave frowned as he tried to answer. \"Well, I suppose the atmosphere is\noxygen and nitrogen, mostly; then there's the ionosphere and the ozone\nlayer. As I remember, the color of the sky is due to the scattering of\nlight--light rays being diffracted in the air.\"\n\n\"Beyond the air,\" Ser Perth said impatiently. \"The sky itself!\"\n\n\"Oh--space. We were just getting out there with manned ships. Mostly\nvacuum, of course. Of course, we're still in the solar atmosphere, even\nthere, with the Van Allen belts and such things. Then there are the\nstars, like our sun, but much more distant. The planets and the moon--\"\n\n\"Ignorance was bad enough,\" Ser Perth interrupted in amazement. He\nstared at Dave, shaking his head in disgust. \"You obviously come from a\nculture of even more superstition than ignorance. Dave Hanson, the sky\nis no such thing. Put aside the myths you heard as a child. The sky is a\nsolid sphere that surrounds Earth. The stars are no more like the sun\nthan the glow of my cigarette is like a forest fire. They are lights on\nthe inside of the sphere, moving in patterns of the Star Art, nearer to\nus than the hot lands to the south.\"\n\n\"Fort,\" Dave said. \"Charles Fort said that in a book.\"\n\nSer Perth shrugged. \"Then why make me say it again? This Fort was right.\nAt least one intelligent man lived in your world, I'm pleased to know.\nThe sky is a dome holding the sun, the stars and the wandering planets.\nThe problem is that the dome is cracking like a great, smashed\neggshell.\"\n\n\"What's beyond the dome?\"\n\nSer Perth shuddered slightly. \"My greatest wish is that I die before I\nlearn. In your world, had you discovered that there were such things as\nelements? That is, basic substances which in combination produce--\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Dave interrupted.\n\n\"Good. Then of the four elements--\" Dave gulped, but kept silent, \"--of\nthe four elements the universe is built. Some things are composed of a\nsingle element; some of two, some of three. The proportions vary and the\nhumors and spirits change but all things are composed of the elements.\nAnd only the sky is composed of all four elements--of earth, of water,\nof fire and of air--in equal proportions. One part each, lending each\nits own essential quality to the mixture, so that the sky is solid as\nearth, radiant as fire, formless as water, insubstantial as air. And the\nsky is cracking and falling, as you have seen for yourself. The effects\nare already being felt. Gamma radiation is flooding through the gaps;\nthe quick-breeding viruses are mutating through half the world, faster\nthan the Medical Art can control them, so that millions of us are\nsneezing and choking--and dying, too, for lack of antibiotics and proper\ncare. Air travel is a perilous thing; just today, a stratosphere roc\ncrashed head-on into a fragment of the sky and was killed with all its\npassengers. Worst of all, the Science of Magic suffers. Because the\nstars are fixed on the dome of the sky. With the crumbling of that dome,\nthe course of the stars has been corrupted. It's pitiful magic that can\nbe worked without regard to the conjunctions of the planets; but it is\nall the magic that is left to us. When Mars trines Neptune, the Medical\nArt is weak; even while we were conjuring you, the trine occurred. It\nalmost cost your life. And it should not have occurred for another seven\ndays.\"\n\nThere was silence, while Ser Perth let Dave consider it. But it was too\nmuch to accept at once, and Dave's mind was a treadmill. He'd agreed to\nadmit anything, but some of this was such complete nonsense that his\nmind rejected it automatically. Yet he was sure Ser Perth was serious;\nthere was no humor on the face of the prissy thin-mustached man before\nhim. Nor had the Sather Karf considered it a joke, he was sure. He had a\nsudden vision of the latter strangling two men from a distance of thirty\nfeet without touching them. That couldn't happen in a sane world,\neither.\n\nDave asked weakly, \"Could I have a drink?\"\n\n\"With a sylph around?\" Ser Perth grimaced. \"You wouldn't have a chance.\nNow, is all clear to you, Dave Hanson?\"\n\n\"Sure. Except for one thing. What am I supposed to do?\"\n\n\"Repair our sky. It should not be too difficult for a man of your\nreputation. You built a wall across a continent high and strong enough\nto change the air currents and affect all your weather--and that in the\ncoldest, meanest country in your world. You come down to us as one of\nthe greatest engineers of history, Dave Hanson, so great that your fame\nhas penetrated even to our world, through the viewing pools of our\nwisest historians. There is a shrine and monument in your world. 'Dave\nHanson, to whom nothing was impossible.' Well, we have a nearly\nimpossible task: a task of engineering and building. If our Science of\nMagic could be relied upon--but it cannot; it never can be, until the\nsky is fixed. We have the word of history: no task is impossible to Dave\nHanson.\"\n\nDave looked at the smug face and a slow grin crept over his own, in\nspite of himself. \"Ser Perth, I'm afraid you've made a slight mistake.\"\n\n\"We don't make mistakes in such matters. You're Dave Hanson,\" Ser Perth\nsaid flatly. \"Of all the powers of the Science, the greatest lies in the\ntrue name. We evoked you by the name of Dave Hanson. You _are_ Dave\nHanson, therefore.\"\n\n\"Don't try to deceive us,\" Nema suggested. Her voice was troubled. \"Pray\nrather that we never have reason to doubt you. Otherwise the wisest of\nthe Satheri would spend their remaining time in planning something\nunthinkable for you.\"\n\nSer Perth nodded vigorous assent. Then he motioned to the office. \"Nema\nwill show you to your quarters later. Use this until you leave. I have\nto report back.\"\n\nDave stared after him until he was gone, and then around at the office.\nHe went to the window and stared upwards at the crazy patchwork of the\nsky. For all he knew, in such a sky there might be cracks. In fact, as\nhe looked, he could make out a rift, and beyond that a ... hole ... a\nsmall patch where there was no color, and yet the sky there was not\nblack. There were no stars there, though points of light were clustered\naround the edges, apparently retreating.\n\nAll he had to do was to repair the sky. Shades of Chicken Little!\n\nMaybe to David Arnold Hanson, the famed engineer, no task was\nimpossible. But quite a few things were impossible to that engineer's\nobscure and unimportant nephew, the computer technician and generally\nundistinguished man who had been christened Dave. They'd gotten the\nright man for the name, all right. But the wrong man for the job.\n\nDave Hanson could repair anything that contained electrical circuits or\nran on tiny jeweled bearings, but he could handle almost nothing else.\nIt wasn't stupidity or incapacity to learn, but simply that he had never\nbeen subjected to the discipline of construction engineering. Even on\nthe project, while working with his uncle, he had seen little of what\nwent on, and hadn't really understood that, except when it produced data\nthat he could feed into his computer. He couldn't drive a nail in the\nwall to hang a picture or patch a hole in the plaster.\n\nBut it seemed that he'd better put on a good show of trying if he wanted\nto continue enjoying good health.\n\n\"I suppose you've got a sample of the sky that's fallen?\" he asked Nema.\n\"And what the heck are you doing here, anyhow? I thought you were a\nnurse.\"\n\nShe frowned at him, but went to a corner where a small ball of some\nclear crystalline substance stood. She muttered into it, while a surly\nface stared out. Then she turned back to him, nodding. \"They are sending\nsome of the sky to you. As to my being a nurse, of course I am. All\nstudent magicians take up the Medical Art for a time. Surely one so\nskilled can also be a secretary, even to the great Dave Hanson? As to\nwhy I'm here--\" She dropped her eyes, frowning, while a touch of added\ncolor reached her cheeks. \"In the sleep spell I used, I invoked that you\nshould be well and true. But I'm only a bachelor in magic, not even a\nmaster, and I slipped. I phrased it that I wanted you well and true.\nHence, well and truly do I want you.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" He stared at her, watching the blush deepen. \"You mean--?\"\n\n\"Take care! First you should know that I am proscribed as a duly\nregistered virgin. And in this time of need, the magic of my blood must\nnot be profaned.\" She twisted sidewise, and then turned toward the door,\navoiding him. Before she reached it, the door opened to show a dull\nclod, entirely naked, holding up a heavy weight of nothing.\n\n\"Your sample of sky,\" she said as the clod labored over to the desk and\ndropped nothing with a dull clank. The desk top dented slightly.\n\nDave could clearly see that nothing was on the desk. But if nothing was\na vacuum, this was an extremely hard and heavy one. It seemed to be\nabout twelve inches on a side, in its rough shape, and must have weighed\ntwo hundred pounds. He tapped it, and it rang. Inside it, a tiny point\nof light danced frantically back and forth.\n\n\"A star,\" she said sadly.\n\n\"I'm going to need some place to experiment with this,\" he suggested. He\nexpected to be sent to the deepest, dankest cave of all the world as a\nlaboratory, and to find it equipped with pedigreed bats, dried unicorn\nhorns and whole rows of alembics that he couldn't use.\n\nNema smiled brightly. \"Of course. We've already prepared a construction\ncamp for you. You'll find most of the tools you used in your world\nwaiting there and all the engineers we could get or make for you.\"\n\nHe'd been considering stalling while he demanded exactly such things. He\nwas reasonably sure by now that they had no transistors, signal\ngenerators, frequency meters or whatever else he could demand. He could\nmake quite an issue out of the need to determine the characteristic\nimpedance of their sky. That might even be interesting, at that; would\nit be anywhere near 300 ohms here? But it seemed that stalling wasn't\ngoing to work. They'd given him what they expected him to need, and he'd\nhave to be careful to need only what they expected, or they might just\ndecide he wasn't Dave Hanson.\n\n\"I can't work on this stuff here,\" he said.\n\n\"Then why didn't you say so?\" she asked sharply. She let out a cry and a\nraven came flying in. She whispered something to it, frowned, and then\nordered it off. \"There's no surface transportation available, and all\nthe local rocs are in use. Well, we'll have to make do with what we\nhave.\"\n\nShe darted for the outer office, rummaged in a cabinet, and came back\nwith a medium-sized rug of worn but gaudy design. Bad imitation Sarouk,\nDave guessed. She tossed it onto the largest cleared space, gobbled\nsome outlandish noises, and dropped onto it, squatting near one end.\nBehind her, the dull clod picked up the sample of sky and fell to his\nface on the rug. At her vehement signal, Dave squatted down beside her,\nnot daring to believe what he was beginning to guess.\n\nThe carpet lifted uncertainly. It seemed to protest at the unbalanced\nweight of the sky piece. She made the sounds again, and it rose\nreluctantly, curling up at the front, like a crazy toboggan. It moved\nslowly, but with increasing speed, sailed out of the office through the\nwindow and began gaining altitude. They went soaring over the city at\nabout thirty miles an hour, heading toward what seemed to be barren land\nbeyond. \"Sometimes they fail now,\" she told him. \"But so far, only if\nthe words are improperly pronounced.\"\n\nHe gulped and looked gingerly over at the city below. As he did, she\ngasped. He heard a great tearing sound of thunder. In the sky, a small\nhole appeared. There was a scream of displaced air, and something went\nzipping downwards in front of them, setting up a wind that bounced the\ncarpet about crazily. Dave glanced over the edge again to see one of the\ntall buildings crumple under the impact. The three top stories were\nripped to shreds. Then the whole building began to change. It slowly\nblossomed into a huge cloud of pink gas that rifted away, to show people\nand objects dropping like stones to the ground below. Nema sighed and\nturned her eyes away.\n\n\"But--it's ridiculous!\" Dave protested. \"We heard the rip and less than\nfive seconds later, that piece fell. If your sky is even twenty miles\nabove us, it would take longer than that to fall.\"\n\n\"It's a thousand miles up,\" she told him. \"And sky has no inertia until\nit is contaminated by contact with the ground. It took longer than\nusual for that piece to fall.\" She sighed. \"It gets worse. Look at the\nsigns. That break has disturbed the planets. We're moving retrograde,\nback to our previous position, out of Sagittarius! Now we'll go back to\nthe character we had before--and just when I was getting used to the\nchange.\"\n\nHe jerked his eyes off the raw patch of emptiness in the sky, where a\nfew stars seemed to be vanishing. \"Your character? Isn't anything stable\nhere?\"\n\n\"Of course not. Naturally, in each House we have a differing of\ncharacter, as does the world itself. Why else should astrology be the\ngreatest of the sciences?\"\n\nIt was a nice world, he decided. And yet the new factor explained some\nthings. He'd been vaguely worried about the apparent change in Ser\nPerth, who'd turned from a serious and helpful doctor into a\nsupercilious, high-handed fop. But--what about his recovery, if that was\nsupposed to be determined by the signs of the zodiac?\n\nHe had no time to ask. The carpet bucked, and the girl began speaking to\nit urgently. It wavered, then righted itself, to begin sliding\ndownwards.\n\n\"There is a ring of protection around your camp,\" Nema explained. \"It is\nset to make entry impossible to one who does not have the words or who\nis unfriendly. The carpet could not go through that, anyway. The ring\nnegates all other magic trying to pass it. And of course we have\nbasilisks mounted on posts around the grounds. They're trained to hood\ntheir eyes, except when they sense anyone trying to enter who should\nnot. You can't be turned to stone looking at one, you know--only by\nhaving one look at you.\"\n\n\"You're cheering me up no end,\" he assured her.\n\nShe smiled pleasantly and began setting the carpet down. Below, he\ncould see a camp that looked much like the camps he had seen in the same\nmovies from which all his clothes had been copied. There were well\nlaid-out rows of sheds, beautiful lines of construction equipment and\neverything in order, as it could never be in a real camp. As he began\nwalking with the girl toward a huge tent that should have belonged to a\ncircus, he could see other discrepancies. The tractors were designed for\nwork in mud flats and the haulers had the narrow wheels used on rocky\nground. Nothing seemed quite as it should be. He spotted a big generator\nworking busily--and then saw a gang of about fifty men, or mandrakes,\nturning a big capstan that kept it going. Here and there were neat racks\nof miscellaneous tools. Some were museum pieces. There was even a gandy\ncart, though no rails for it to run on.\n\nThey were almost at the main tent when a crow flew down and yelled\nsomething in Nema's ear. She scowled, and nodded. \"I'm needed back,\" she\nsaid. \"Most of the men here--\" She pointed to the gangs that moved about\nbusily doing nothing, all in costumes similar to his, except for the\nboots and hat. \"They're mandrakes, conjured into existence, but without\nsouls. The engineers we have are snatched from Duality just after dying\nand revived here while their brains still retain their knowledge. They\nhave no true souls either, of course, but they don't know it. Ah. The\nshort man there--he's Garm. Sersa Garm, an apprentice to Ser Perth. He's\nto be your foreman, and he's real.\"\n\nShe headed back to the outskirts, then turned to shout back. \"Sather\nKarf says you may have ten days to fix the sky,\" she called. Her hand\nwaved toward him in friendly good-bye. \"Don't worry, Dave Hanson. I have\nfaith in you.\"\n\nThen she was running toward her reluctant carpet.\n\nDave stared up at the mottled dome above him and at the dull\nclod--certainly a mandrake--who was still carrying the sample. With all\nthis preparation and a time limit, he couldn't even afford to stall.\nHe'd never fully understood why some plastics melted and others turned\nhard when heated, but he had to find what was wrong with the dome above\nand how to fix it. And maybe the time limit could be stretched a little,\nonce he came up with the answer. Maybe. He'd worry about that after he\nworried about the first steps.\n\nSersa Garm proved to be a glum, fat young man, overly aware of his\nimportance in training for serhood. He led Dave through the big tent,\ntaking pride in the large drafting section--under the obvious belief\nthat it was used for designing spells. Maybe it could have been useful\nfor that if there had been a single man who knew anything about\ndraftsmanship. There were four engineers, supposedly. One, who had died\nfalling off a bridge while drunk, was curing himself of the shock by\nremaining dead drunk. One had been a chemical engineer specializing in\nmaking yeast and dried soya meal into breakfast cereals. Another knew\nall about dredging canals and the last one was an electronics\nengineer--a field in which Dave was far more competent.\n\nHe dismissed them. Whatever had been done to them--or perhaps the\nabsence of a true soul, whatever that was--left them rigidly bound to\ntheir past ideas and totally incapable of doing more than following\norders by routine now. Even Sersa Garm was more useful.\n\nThat young man could offer little information, however. The sky, he\nexplained pompously, was a great mystery that only an adept might\ncommunicate to another. He meant that he didn't know about it, Dave\ngathered. Everything, it turned out, was either a mystery or a rumor.\nHe also had a habit of sucking his thumb when pressed too hard for\ndetails.\n\n\"But you must have heard some guesses about what started the cracks in\nthe sky?\" Dave suggested.\n\n\"Oh, indeed, that is common knowledge,\" Sersa Garm admitted. He changed\nthumbs while he considered. \"'Twas an experiment most noble, but through\nmischance going sadly awry. A great Sather made the sun remain in one\nplace too long, and the heat became too great. It was like the Classic\nexperiment--\"\n\n\"How hot is your sun?\"\n\nThere was a long pause. Then Sather Germ shrugged. \"'Tis a great\nmystery. Suffice to say it has no true heat, but does send forth an\nactivating principle against the phlogiston layer, which being excited\ngrows vengeful against the air ... but you have not the training to\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Okay, so they didn't tell you, if they knew.\" Dave stared up at the\nsun, trying to guess. The light looked about like what he was used to,\nwhere the sky was still whole. North light still was like what a color\nphotographer would consider 5500\u00b0 Kelvin, so the sun must be pretty hot.\nHot enough to melt anything he knew about. \"What's the melting point of\nthis sky material?\"\n\nHe never did manage to make Sather Garm understand what a melting point\nwas. But he found that one of the solutions tried had been the bleeding\nof eleven certified virgins for seven days. When the blood was mixed\nwith dragonfeathers and frogsdown and melded with a genuine\nphilosopher's stone, they had used it to ink in the right path of the\nplanets of a diagram. It had failed. The sky had cracked and a piece had\nfallen into the vessel of blood, killing a Sather who was less than two\nthousand years old.\n\n\"Two thousand?\" Dave asked. \"How old is Sather Karf?\"\n\n\"None remembers truly. He has always been the Sather Karf--at least ten\nthousand years or more. To attain the art of a Sather is the work of a\nscore of centuries, usually.\"\n\nThat Sather had been in sad shape, it seemed. No one had been able to\nrevive him, though bringing the dead back to life when the body was\nreasonably intact was routine magic that even a sersa could perform. It\nwas after that they'd begun conjuring back to Dave's world for all the\nother experts.\n\n\"All whose true names they could find, that is,\" Garm amended. \"The\nEgyptian pyramid builder, the man who discovered your greatest science,\ndianetics, the great Cagliostro--and what a time we had finding his true\nname! I was assigned to the helping of one who had discovered the\nsecrets of gravity and some strange magic which he termed\nrelativity--though indeed it had little to do with kinship, but was a\nprivate mystery. But when he was persuaded by divers means to help us,\nhe gave up after one week, declaring it beyond his powers. They were\neven planning what might best be done to chastise him when he discovered\nin some manner a book of elementary conjuration and did then devise some\nstrange new formula from the elements with which magic he disappeared.\"\n\nIt was nice to know that Einstein had given up on the problem, Dave\nthought bitterly. As nice as the discovery that there was no fuel for\nthe equipment here. He spent an hour rigging up a portable saw to use in\nattempting to cut off a smaller piece of the sky, and then saw the\nmotor burn out when he switched it on. It turned out that all\nelectricity here was d.c., conjured up by commanding the electrons in a\nwire to move in one direction, and completely useless with a.c. motors.\nIt might have been useful for welding, but there was no electric torch.\n\n\"'Tis obviously not a thing of reason,\" Garm told him severely. \"If the\ncurrent in such a form moves first in one direction and then in the\nother, then it cancels out and is useless. No, you must be wrong.\"\n\nAs Dave remembered it, Tesla had been plagued by similar doubts from\nsuch men as Edison. He gave up and settled finally for one of the native\nwelding torches, filled with a dozen angry salamanders. The flame or\nwhatever it was had enough heat, but it was hard to control. By the time\nhe learned to use it, night had fallen, and he was too tired to try\nanything more. He ate a solitary supper and went to sleep.\n\nDuring the next three days he learned a few things the hard way,\nhowever. In spite of Garm's assurance that nothing could melt the sky,\nhe found that his sample would melt slowly under the heat of the torch.\nIn the liquid state, it was jet black, though it cooled back to complete\ntransparency. It was also without weight when in liquid form--a fact he\ndiscovered when it began rising through the air and spattering over\neverything, including his bare skin. The burns were nasty, but somehow\nseemed to heal with remarkable speed. Sersa Garm was impressed by the\ndiscoveries, and went off to suck his thumbs and brood over the new\nknowledge, much to Dave's relief.\n\nMore work established the fact that welding bits of the sky together was\nnot particularly difficult. The liquid sky was perfectly willing to bond\nonto anything, including other bits of itself.\n\nNow, if he could get a gang up the thousand miles to the sky with enough\ntorches to melt the cracks, it might recongeal as a perfect sphere. The\nstuff was strong, but somewhat brittle. He still had no idea of how to\nget the stars and planets back in the right places.\n\n\"The mathematician thought of such an idea,\" Sersa Garm said sourly.\n\"But 'twould never work. Even with much heat, it could not be done. For\nsee you, the upper air is filled with phlogiston, which no man can\nbreathe. Also, the phlogiston has negative weight, as every school child\nmust know. Your liquid sky would sink through it, since negative weight\nmust in truth be lighter than no weight, while nothing else would rise\nthrough the layer. And phlogiston will quench the flame of a rocket, as\nyour expert von Braun discovered.\"\n\nThe man was a gold mine of information, all bad. The only remaining\nsolution, apparently, was to raise a scaffolding over the whole planet\nto the sky, and send up mandrakes to weld back the broken pieces. They\nwouldn't need to breathe, anyhow. With material of infinite\nstrength--and an infinite supply of it--and with infinite time and\npatience, it might have been worth considering.\n\nNema came out the next day with more cheering information. Her\nmulti-times great grandfather, Sather Karf, regretted it, but he must\nhave good news to release at once; the populace was starving because the\nfood multipliers couldn't produce reliable supplies. Otherwise, Dave\nwould find venom being transported into his blood in increasing amounts\nuntil the pain drove him mad. And, just incidentally, the Sons of the\nEgg who'd attacked him in the hospital had tried to reach the camp twice\nalready, once by interpenetrating into a shipment of mandrakes, which\nindicated to what measures they would resort. They meant to kill him\nsomehow, and the defense of him was growing too costly unless there were\npositive results.\n\nDave hinted at having nearly reached the solution, giving her only a bit\nof his wild idea of welding the sky. She took off with that, but he was\nsure it wouldn't satisfy the Sather. In that, he was right. By\nnightfall, when she came back from the city, he was groaning in pain.\nThe venom had arrived ahead of her, and his blood seemed to be on fire.\n\nShe laid a cool hand on his forehead. \"Poor Dave,\" she said. \"If I were\nnot registered and certified, sometimes I feel that I might ... but no\nmore of that. Ser Perth sends you this unguent which will hold back the\nvenom for a time, cautioning you not to reveal his softness.\" Ser Perth,\nit seemed, had reverted to his pre-Sagittarian character as expected.\n\"And Sather Karf wants the full plans at once. He is losing patience.\"\n\nHe began rubbing on the ointment, which helped slightly. She peeled back\nhis shirt and began helping, apparently delighted with the hair which\nhe'd sprouted on his chest since his reincarnation. The unguent helped,\nbut it wasn't enough.\n\n\"He never had any patience to lose. What the hell does he expect me to\ndo?\" Dave asked hotly. \"Snap my fingers thus, yell _abracadabra_ and\ngive him egg in his beer?\"\n\nHe stopped to stare at his hand, where a can of beer had suddenly\nmaterialized!\n\nNema squealed in delight. \"What a novel way to conjure, Dave. Let me try\nit.\" She began snapping her fingers and saying the word eagerly, but\nnothing happened. Finally she turned back to him. \"Show me again.\"\n\nHe was sure it wouldn't work twice, and he hesitated, not too willing to\nhave his stock go down with her. Then he gave in.\n\n\"_Abracadabra!_\" he said, and snapped his fingers.\n\nThere were results at once. This time an egg appeared in his hand, to\nthe delighted cry of Nema. He bent to look at it uncertainly. It was a\nstrange looking egg--more like one of the china eggs used to make hens\nthink they were nesting when their eggs were still being taken from\nthem.\n\nAbruptly Nema sprang back. But she was too late. The egg was growing. It\nswelled to the size of a football, then was man-sized, and growing to\nthe size of a huge tank that filled most of the tent. Suddenly it split\nopen along one side and a group of men in dull robes and masks came\nspilling out of it.\n\n\"Die!\" the one in front yelled. He lifted a double-bladed knife, charged\nfor Dave, and brought the knife down.\n\nThe blades went through clothing, skin, flesh and bones, straight for\nDave's heart.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThe knife had pierced Dave's chest until the hilt pressed against his\nrib cage. He stared down at it, seeing it rise with the heaving of his\nlungs. Yet he was still alive!\n\nThen the numbness of shock wore off and the pain nerves carried their\nmessages to his brain. He still lived, but there was unholy agony\nwhere the blade lay. Coughing and choking on what must be his own\nblood, he scrabbled at the knife and ripped it out. Blood jetted from\nthe gaping rent in his clothing. It gushed forth--and slowed; it\nfrothed--trickled--and stopped entirely.\n\nAs he ripped his shirt back to look, the wound was closed already. But\nthere was no easing of the pain that threatened to make him black out at\nany second.\n\nHe heard shouting, quarreling voices, but nothing made sense through the\nhaze of his agony. He felt someone grab at him--more than one\nperson--and they were dragging him willy-nilly across the ground.\nSomething was clutched around his throat, almost choking him. He opened\nhis eyes just as something clicked behind him.\n\nThe huge, translucent walls of the monstrous egg were all around him and\nthe opened side was closing.\n\nThe pain began to abate. The bleeding had already stopped entirely and\nhis lungs seemed to have cleared themselves of the blood and froth in\nthem. Now with the ache of the wound ceasing, Dave could still feel the\nvenom burning in his blood, and the constriction around his throat was\nstill there, making it hard to breathe. He sat up, trying to free\nhimself. The constriction came from an arm around his neck, but he\ncouldn't see to whom it belonged, and there was no place to move aside\nin the corner of the egg.\n\nFrom inside, the walls of the egg were transparent enough for him to see\ncloudy outlines of what lay beyond. He could see the ground sweeping\naway beneath them from all points. A man had run up and was standing\nbeside the egg, beating at it. The man suddenly shot up like a fountain,\ngrowing huge; he towered over them, until he seemed miles high and the\ngiant structures Dave could see were only the turned-up toes of the\nman's shoes. One of those shoes was lifting, as if the man meant to step\non the egg.\n\nThey must be growing smaller again.\n\nA voice said tightly: \"We're small enough, Bork. Can you raise the wind\nfor us now?\"\n\n\"Hold on.\" Bork's voice seemed sure of itself.\n\nThe egg tilted and soared. Dave was thrown sidewise and had to fight for\nbalance. He stared unbelievingly through the crystal shell. They rose\nlike a Banshee jet. There was a shaggy, monstrous colossus in the\ndistance, taller than the Himalayas--the man who had been beside them.\nBork grunted. \"Got it! We're all right now.\" He chanted something in a\nrapid undertone \"All right, relax. That will teach them not to work\nresonance magic inside a protective ring; the egg knows how we could\nhave got through otherwise. Lucky we were trying at the right time,\nthough. The Satheri must be going crazy. Wait a minute, this tires the\nfingers.\"\n\nThe man called Bork halted the series of rapid passes he had been\nmaking, flexing his fingers with a grimace. The spinning egg began to\ndrop at once, but he let out a long, keening cry, adding a slight flip\nof his other arm. Outside, something like a mist drew near and swirled\naround them. It looked huge to Dave, but must have been a small thing in\nfact. Now they began speeding along smoothly again. The thing was\nprobably another sylph, strong enough to move them in their present\nreduced size.\n\nBork pointed his finger. \"There's the roc!\" He leaned closer to the wall\nof the tiny egg and shouted. The sylph changed direction, and began to\nbob about.\n\nIt drifted gently, while Bork pulled a few sticks with runes written on\nthem toward him and made a hasty assembly of them. At once, there was a\nfeeling of growing, and the sylph began to shrink away from them. Now\nthey were falling swiftly, growing as they dropped. Dave felt his\nstomach twist, until he saw they were heading toward a huge bird that\nwas cruising along under them, drawing closer. It looked like a cross\nbetween a condor and a hawk, but its wing span must have been over three\nhundred feet. It slipped under the egg, catching the falling object\ndeftly on a cushion-like attachment between its wings, and then struck\noff briskly toward the east.\n\nBork snapped the side of the egg open and stepped out while the others\nfollowed. Dave tried to crawl out, but something held him back. It\nwasn't until Bork's big hand reached in to help him that he made it.\nWhen all were out, Bork tapped the egg-shaped object and caught it as it\nshrank. When it was small enough, he pocketed it.\n\nDave sat up again, examining himself, now that he had more room. His\nclothing was a mess, spattered with drying blood, but he seemed unharmed\nnow. Even the burning of the venom was gone. He reached for the arm\naround his neck and began breaking it free from its stranglehold.\n\nFrom behind an incredulous cry broke out. Nema sprawled across him,\nstaring at his face and burying her head against his shoulder. \"Dave!\nYou're not dead! You're alive!\"\n\nDave was still amazed at that himself. But Bork snorted. \"Of course he\nis. Why'd we take him along with you hanging on in a faint if he were\ndead? When the snetha-knife kills, it kills completely. They stay dead,\nor they don't die. Sagittarian?\"\n\nShe nodded, and the big man seemed to be doing some calculations in his\nhead.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he decided. \"It would be. There was one second there around\nmidnight when all the signs were at their absolute maximum\nfavorableness. Someone must have said some pretty dangerous health\nspells over him then.\" He turned to Dave, as if aware that the other was\ncomparatively ignorant of such matters. \"Happened once before, without\nthis mess-up of the signs. They revived a corpse and found he was\nunkillable from then on. He lasted eight thousand years, or something\nlike that, before he got burned trying to control a giant salamander.\nThey cut off his head once, but it healed before the axe was all the way\nthrough. Woops!\"\n\nThe bird had dipped downward, rushing toward the ground. It landed at a\nhundred miles an hour and managed to stop against a small entrance to a\ncave in the hillside. Except for the one patch where the bird had\nlighted, they were in the middle of a dense forest.\n\nDave and Nema were hustled into the cave, while the others melted into\nthe woods, studying the skies. She clung to Dave, crying something about\nhow the Sons of the Egg would torture them.\n\n\"All right,\" he said finally. \"Who are these sons of eggs? And what have\nthey got against me?\"\n\n\"They're monsters,\" she told him. \"They used to be the antimagic\nindividualists. They wanted magic used only when other means wouldn't\nwork. They fought against the Satheri. While magic produced their food\nand made a better world for them, they hated it because they couldn't do\nit for themselves. And a few renegade priests like my brother joined\nthem.\"\n\n\"Your brother?\"\n\n\"She means me,\" Bork said. He came in to drop on his haunches and grin\nat Dave. There was no sign of personal hatred in his look. \"I used to be\na stooge for Sather Karf, before I got sick of it. How do you feel, Dave\nHanson?\"\n\nDave considered it, still in wonder at the truth. \"I feel good. Even the\nvenom they were putting in my blood doesn't seem to hurt any more.\"\n\n\"Fine. Means the Sather Karf must believe we killed you--he must have\nthe report by now. If he thinks you're dead, there's no point in his\ngiving chase; he knows I wouldn't let them kill Nema, even if she is a\nlittle fool. Anyhow, he's not really such a bad old guy, Dave--not, like\nsome of those Satheri. Well, you figure how you'd like it if you were\njust a simple man and some priest magicked her away from you--and then\nsent her back with enough magic of her own to be a witch and make life\nhell for you because she'd been kicked out by the priest, but he hadn't\npulled the wanting spell off her. Or anything else you wanted and\ncouldn't keep against magic. Sure, they fed us. They had to, after they\ntook away our fields and the kine, and got everyone into the habit of\ntaking their dole instead of earning our living in the old way. They\nmade slaves of us. Any man who lets another be responsible for him _is_\na slave. It's a fine world for the Satheri, if they can keep the egg\nfrom breaking.\"\n\n\"What's all this egg nonsense?\"\n\nBork shrugged. \"Plain good sense. Why should there be a sky shell around\nthe planet? Look, there's a legend here. You should know it, since for\nall I know it has some meaning for you. Long ago--or away, or\nwhatever--there was a world called Thar\u00e9 and another called Erath. Two\nworlds, separate and distinct, on their own branching time paths. They\nmust have been that way since the moment of creation. One was a world of\nrule and law. One plus one might not always equal two, but it had to\nequal something. There seems to be some similarity to your world in\nthat, doesn't there? The other was--well, you'd call it chaos, though it\nhad some laws, if they could be predicted. One plus one there\ndepended--or maybe there was no such thing as unity. Mass-energy wasn't\nconserved. It was deserved. It was a world of anarchy, from your point\nof view. It must have been a terrible place to live, I guess.\"\n\nHe hesitated somberly. \"As terrible as this one is getting to be,\" he\nsaid at last. \"Anyway, there were people who lived there. There were the\ntwo inhabited worlds in their own time lines, or probability orbits, or\nwhatever. You know, I suppose, how worlds of probability would separate\nand diverge as time goes on? Of course. Well, these two worlds\n_coalesced_.\"\n\nHe looked searchingly at Dave. \"Do you see it? The two time lines came\ntogether. Two opposites fused into one. Don't ask me to explain it; it\nwas long ago, and all I know for sure is that it happened. The two\nworlds met and fused, and out of the two came this world, in what the\nbooks call the _Dawnstruggle_. When it was over, our world was as it\nhas been for thousands of centuries. In fact, one result was that in\ntheory, neither original world could have a real past, and the fusion\nwas something that had been--no period of change. It's pretty\ncomplicated.\"\n\n\"It sounds worse than that,\" Dave grumbled. \"But while that might\nexplain the mystery of magic working here, it doesn't explain your sky.\"\n\nBork scratched his head. \"No, not too well,\" he admitted. \"I've always\nhad some doubts about whether or not all the worlds have a shell around\nthem. I don't know. But our world does, and the shell is cracking. The\nSatheri don't like it; they want to stop it. We want it to happen. For\nthe two lines that met and fused into one have an analogue. Doesn't the\nstory of that fusion suggest something to you, Dave Hanson? Don't you\nsee it, the male principle of rule and the female principle of whim;\nthey join, and the egg is fertile! Two universes join, and the result is\na nucleus world surrounded by a shell, like an egg. We're a universe\negg. And when an egg hatches, you don't try to put it back together!\"\n\nHe didn't look like a fanatic, Dave told himself. Crazy or not, he took\nthis business of the hatching egg seriously. But you could never be sure\nabout anyone who joined a cult. \"What is your egg going to hatch into?\"\nhe asked.\n\nThe big man shrugged. \"Does an egg know it is going to become a hen--or\nmaybe a fish? We can't possibly tell, of course.\"\n\nDave considered it. \"Don't you even have a guess?\"\n\nBork answered shortly, \"No.\" He looked worried, Dave thought, and\nguessed that even the fanatics were not quite sure they _wanted_ to be\nhatched. Bork shrugged again.\n\n\"An egg has got to hatch,\" he said. \"That's all there is to it. We\nprophesied this, oh, two hundred years ago. The Satheri laughed. Now\nthey've stopped laughing, but they want to stop it. What happens to a\nchick when it is stopped from hatching? Does it go on being a chick, or\ndoes it die? It dies, of course. And we don't want to die. No, Dave\nHanson, we don't know what happens next--but we do know that we must go\nthrough with it. I have nothing against you personally--but I can't let\nyou stop us. That's why we tried to kill you. If I could, I'd kill you\nnow, with the snetha-knife so they couldn't revive you.\"\n\nDave said reasonably, \"You can't expect me to like it, you know. The\nSatheri, at least, saved my life--\" He stopped in confusion. Bork was\nstaring at him in hilarious incredulousness that broke into roars of\nlaughter.\n\n\"You mean ... Dave Hanson, do you believe everything they tell you?\nDon't you know that the Satheri arranged to kill you first? They needed\na favorable death conjunction to bring you back to life; they got it--by\narranging an accident!\"\n\nNema cried out in protest. \"That's a lie!\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Bork said mildly. \"You always were on their side, little\nsister. You were also usually a darned nuisance, fond as I was of you.\nCome here.\"\n\nHe caught her and yanked a single hair out of her head. She screamed and\ntried to claw him, then fought for the hair. Bork was immovable. He held\nher off easily with one hand while the fingers of the other danced in\nthe air. He spoke what seemed to be a name, though it bore no\nresemblance to Nema. She quieted, trembling.\n\n\"You'll find a broom near the entrance, little sister. Take it and go\nback, to forget that Dave Hanson lives. You saw him die and were\ndragged off with us and his body. You escaped before we reached our\nhideaway. By the knot I tie in your true hair and by your secret name,\nthis I command.\"\n\nShe blinked slowly and looked around as Bork burned the knotted hair.\nHer eyes swept past Bork and Dave without seeing them and centered on\nthe broom one man held out to her, without appearing to see him, either.\nShe seized the broom. A sob came to her throat. \"The devil! The renegade\ndevil! He didn't have to kill Dave! He didn't--\"\n\nHer voice died away as she ran toward the clearing. Dave made no\nprotest. He suspected Bork was putting the spell on her for her own\ngood, and he agreed that she was better out of all this.\n\n\"Now where were we?\" Bork asked. \"Oh, yes, I was trying to convert you\nand knowing I'd failed already. Of course, I don't know that they killed\nyou first--but those are their methods. Take it from me, I know. I was\nthe youngest Ser ever to be accepted for training as a Sather. They\nwanted you, so they got you.\"\n\nDave considered it. It seemed as likely as anything else. \"Why me?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Because you can put back the sky. At least, the Satheri think so, and I\nmust admit that in some ways they are smarter than we.\"\n\nDave started to protest, but Bork cut him off.\n\n\"I know all about your big secret. You're not the engineer, whose true\nname was longer. We know all that. Our pools are closer to perfection\nthan theirs, not being contaminated by city air, and we see more. But\nthere is a cycle of confirmation; if prophecy indicates a thing will\nhappen, it will happen--though not always as expected. The prophecy\nfulfills itself, rather than being fulfilled. Then there are the words\non the monument--a monument meant for your uncle, but carrying your true\nname, because his friends felt the short form sounded better. It was\nsomething of a coincidence that they had the wrong true name. But\nprophecy is always strongest when based on coincidence--that is a prime\nrule. And those words coupled with our revelations prophesy that\n_you_--not your uncle--can do the impossible. So what are we going to do\nwith you?\"\n\nBork's attitude was reassuring, somehow. It was nearer his own than any\nDave had heard on this world. And the kidnapping was beginning to look\nlike a relief. The Sons of the Egg had gotten him off the hook with\nSather Karf. He grinned and stretched back. \"If I'm unkillable, Bork,\nwhat can you do?\"\n\nThe big man grinned back. \"Flow rock around you up to your nose and toss\nyou into a lake. You'd live there--but you'd always be drowning and\nyou'd find it slightly unpleasant for the next few thousand years! It's\nnot as bad as being turned into a mangrove with your soul intact, but it\nwould last longer. And don't think the Satheri can't pull a lot worse\nthan that. They have your name--everyone has your secret name here--and\nparts of you.\"\n\nThe conversation was suddenly less pleasant. Dave thought it over. \"I\ncould stay here and join your group. I might as well, since I can't\nreally help the Satheri anyhow.\"\n\n\"They'd spot your aura eventually. They'll be checking around here for\nus for a while. Of course, we might do something about it, if you really\nconverted. But I don't think you would, if you knew more.\" Bork got up\nand headed for the entrance. \"I wasn't going to let you see the\nrisings, but now maybe I will. If you still want to join, it might be\nworked. Otherwise, I'll think of something else.\"\n\nDave followed the man out into the clearing. A few men were just\nplanning to leave, and they looked at Dave suspiciously, but made no\nprotest. One, whom Dave recognized as the leader with the snetha-knife,\nscowled.\n\n\"The risings are almost due, Bork,\" he said.\n\nBork nodded. \"I know, Malok. I've decided to let Dave Hanson watch.\nDave, this is our leader here, Res Malok.\"\n\nDave felt no strong love for his would-be murderer, and it seemed to be\nmutual. But no protest was lodged. Apparently Bork was their top\nconjurer, and privileged. They crossed the clearing and went through the\nwoods toward another, smaller one. Here a group of some fifty men were\nwatching the sky, obviously waiting. Others stood around, watching them\nand avoiding looking up. Almost directly overhead, there was a rent\nplace where the strange absence of color or feature indicated a hole in\nthe dome over them. As it drew nearer true vertical, a chanting began\namong the men with up-turned faces. Their hands went upwards, fingers\nspread and curled into an unnatural position. Then they stood waiting.\n\n\"I don't like it,\" Bork whispered to Dave. \"This is one of the reasons\nwe're growing too weak to fight the Satheri.\"\n\n\"What's wrong with a ceremony of worship, if you must worship your\neggshell?\" Dave asked.\n\n\"You'll see. That was all it was once--just worship. But now for weeks,\nthings are changing. They think it's a sign of favor, but I don't know.\nThere, watch!\"\n\nThe hole in the sky was directly overhead now, and the moaning had\nrisen in pitch. Across the little clearing, Malok began backing quietly\naway, carefully not looking upwards. Nobody but Dave seemed to notice\nhis absence. There was a louder moan.\n\nOne of the men in the clearing began to rise upwards slowly. His body\nwas rigid as it lifted a foot, ten feet, then a hundred above the\nground. Now it picked up speed, and rushed upwards. Another began to\nrise, and another. In seconds, more than half of those who had waited\nwere screaming upwards toward the hole in the sky. They disappeared in\nthe distance.\n\nThose who had merely stood by and those who had worshipped waited a few\nseconds more, but no more rose. The men sighed and began moving out of\nthe clearing. Dave arose to follow, but Bork gestured for him to wait.\n\n\"Sometimes--\" he said.\n\nThey were alone now. Still Bork waited, staring upwards. Then Dave saw\nsomething in the sky. A speck appeared and came hurtling down. In\nseconds, it was the body of one of the men who had risen. Dave felt his\nstomach tighten and braced himself. There was no slowing as the body\nfell. It landed in the center of the clearing, without losing speed, but\nwith less noise than he had expected.\n\nWhen they reached the shattered body, there could be no question of its\nbeing dead.\n\nBork's face was solemn. \"If you're thinking of joining, you'd better\nknow the worst. You're too easily shocked to make a good convert unless\nyou're prepared. The risings have been going on for some time. Malok\nswears it proves we are right. But I've seen five other bodies come down\nlike this. What does it mean? Are they stillborn? We don't know. Shall\nI revive him for you?\"\n\nDave felt sick as he stared at the ghastly terror on the face of the\ncorpse. The last thing he wanted to see was its revival, but his\ncuriosity about the secret in the sky could not be denied. He nodded.\n\nBork drew a set of phials and implements in miniature size from under\nhis robe. \"This is routine,\" he said. He snapped his fingers and\nproduced a small flame over the heart of the corpse. Into that he began\ndusting powders, mixing them with something that looked like blood.\nFinally he called a name and a command. There was a sharp explosion, a\nhissing, and Bork's voice calling.\n\nThe dead man flowed together and was whole. He stood up woodenly, with\nhis face frozen. \"Who calls?\" he asked in an uninflected, hollow voice.\n\"Why am I called? I have no soul.\"\n\n\"We call,\" Bork answered. \"Tell us what you saw at the hole in the sky.\"\n\nA scream tore from the throat of the thing, and its hands came up to its\neyes, tearing at them. Its mouth worked soundlessly, and breath sucked\nin. Then a single word came out.\n\n\"Faces!\"\n\nIt fell onto the grass, distorted in death again. Bork shuddered.\n\n\"The others were the same,\" he said. \"And he can't be revived again.\nEven the strongest spell can't bring back his soul. That is gone,\nsomehow.\"\n\nDave shivered. \"And knowing that, you'd still fight against repairing\nthe sky?\"\n\n\"Hatching is probably always horrible from inside the shell,\" Bork\nanswered. \"Do you still want to join us? No, I thought not. Well, then,\nlet's go back. We might as well try to eat something while I think\nabout what to do with you.\"\n\nMalok and most of the others were gone when they reached the cave again.\nBork fell to work with some scraps of food, cursing the configurations\nof the planets as his spell refused to work. Then suddenly the scraps\nbecame a mass of sour-smelling stuff. Bork made a face as he tasted it,\nbut he ate it in silence. Dave couldn't force himself to put it in his\nmouth, though he was hungry by then.\n\nHe considered, and then snapped his fingers. \"Abracadabra,\" he cried. He\nswore as something wet and slimy that looked like seaweed plopped into\nhis hand. The next time he got a limp fish that had been dead far too\nlong. But the third try worked better. This time, a whole bunch of\nbananas appeared. They were a little riper than he liked, but some of\nthem were edible enough. He handed some to the other man, who quickly\nabandoned his own creation.\n\nBork was thoughtful as he ate. Finally he grimaced. \"New magic!\" he\nsaid. \"Maybe that's the secret of the prophecy. I thought you knew no\nmagic.\"\n\n\"I didn't,\" Dave admitted. He was still tingling inside himself at this\nconfirmation of his earlier discovery. It was unpredictable magic, but\napparently bore some vague relationship to what he was wishing for.\n\n\"So the lake's out,\" Bork decided. \"With unknown powers at your command,\nyou might escape in time. Well, that settles it. There's one place where\nnobody will look for you or listen to you. You'll be nothing but another\namong millions, and that's probably the best hiding place for you. With\nthe overseers they have, you couldn't even turn yourself back to the\nSatheri, though I'll admit I'm hoping you don't want them to find you.\"\n\n\"And I was beginning to think you liked me,\" Dave commented bitterly.\n\nBork grinned. \"I do, Dave Hanson. That's why I'm picking the easiest\nplace to hide you I can think of. It will be hell, but anything else\nwould be worse. Better strip and put this cloth on.\"\n\nThe thing he held out was little more than a rag, apparently torn from\none of the robes. \"Come on, strip, or I'll burn off your clothes with a\nsalamander. There, that's better. Now wrap the cloth around your waist\nand let it hang down in front. It'll be easier on you if you don't\nattract much attention. The sky seems to indicate the planets favor\nteleportation now. Be quick before I change my mind and think of\nsomething worse!\"\n\nDave didn't see what he did this time, but there was a puff of flame in\nfront of his eyes.\n\nThe next second, he stood manacled in a long line of men loaded with\nheavy stones. Over their backs fell the cutting lashes of a whip. Far\nahead was a partially finished pyramid. Dave was obviously one of the\nbuilding slaves.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nSunrise glared harshly over the desert. It was already hot enough to\nsend heat waves dancing over the sand as Hanson wakened under the bite\nof a lash. The overseers were shouting and kicking the slaves awake.\nOverhead the marred sky shone in crazy quilt patterns.\n\nHanson stood up, taking the final bite of the whip without flinching. He\nglanced down at his body, noticing that it had somehow developed a\nhealthy deep tan during the few hours of murderous labor the day before.\nHe wasn't particularly surprised. Something in his mind seemed also to\nhave developed a \"tan\" that let him face the bite of chance without\nflinching. He'd stopped wondering and now accepted; he meant to get away\nfrom here at the first chance and he was somehow sure he could.\n\nIt was made easier by the boundless strength of his new body. He showed\nno signs of buckling under physical work that would have killed him on\nhis own world.\n\nNot all the slaves got up. Two beside him didn't move at all. Sleeping\nthrough that brutal awakening seemed impossible. When Hanson looked\ncloser, he saw that they weren't asleep; they were dead.\n\nThe overseer raged back along the line and saw them. He must be one of\nthose conjured into existence here from the real Egypt of the past. He\nmight have no soul, but a lifetime of being an overseer had given him\nhabits that replaced the need for what had been a pretty slim soul to\nbegin with.\n\n\"Quitters!\" he yelled. \"Lazy, worthless, work-dodging goldbrick\nartists!\" He knelt in fury, thumbing back the eyelids of the corpses.\nThere was little need for the test. They were too limp, too waxen to be\npretending.\n\nThe overseer cut them out of the chain and kicked at Hanson. \"Move\nalong!\" he bellowed. \"Menes himself is here, and he's not as gentle as I\nam.\"\n\nHanson joined the long line, wondering what they were going to do about\nbreakfast. How the devil did they expect the slaves to put in sixteen\nhours of work without some kind of food? There had been nothing the\nnight before but a skin of water. There was not even that much this\nmorning. No wonder the two beside him had died from overwork, beatings\nand plain starvation.\n\nMenes was there, all right. Hanson saw him from the distance, a skinny\ngiant of a man in breechclout, cape and golden headdress. He bore a whip\nlike everyone else who seemed to have any authority at all, but he\nwasn't using it. He was standing hawklike on a slight rise in the sandy\nearth, motionless and silent. Beside him was a shorter figure: a pudgy\nman with a thin mustache, on whom the Egyptian headdress looked\nstrangely out of place. It could only be Ser Perth!\n\nHanson's staring came to an end as the lash cut down across his\nshoulders, biting through to the shoulder-bone. He stumbled forward,\nheedless of the overseers' shouting voices. Someday, if he had the\nchance, he'd flay his own overseer, but that could wait. Even the agony\nof the cut couldn't take his mind from Ser Perth's presence. Had Bork\nslipped up--did the Satheri know that Hanson was still alive, and had\nthey sent Ser Perth here to locate him? It seemed unlikely, however. The\nman was paying no attention to the lines of slaves. It would be hard to\nspot one among three million, anyhow. More likely, Hanson decided, Ser\nPerth was supervising the supervisors, making an inspection tour of all\nthis.\n\nOf all what? Apparently then this must be another of their frenzied\nefforts to find a way to put back the sky. He'd heard that they had\ncalled up the pyramid builder, but hadn't fully realized it would lead\nto this type of activity.\n\nHe looked around him appraisingly. The long lines of slaves that had\nbeen carrying rock and rubble the day before now were being formed into\nhauling teams. Long ropes were looped around enormous slabs of quarried\nrock. Rollers underneath them and slaves tugging and pushing at them\nwere the only means of moving them. The huge stones slid remorselessly\nforward onto the prepared beds of rubble. Casting back in his memory,\nHanson could not recall seeing the rock slabs the night before. They had\nappeared as if by magic--\n\nObviously, they had really been conjured up by magic. But if the rocks\ncould be conjured, what was the need of all the slaves and the sadistic\noverseers? Why not simply magic the entire construction, whatever it was\nto be?\n\nThe whip hit him again, and the raging voice of the overseer ranted in\nhis ears. \"Get on, you blundering slacker. Menes himself is looking at\nyou. Ho there--what the devil?\"\n\nThe overseer's hand spun Hanson around. The man's eyes, large and\nopaque, stared at Hanson. He frowned cruelly. \"Yeah, you're the same\none! Didn't I take the hide off your back twice already? And now you\nstand there without a scar or a drop of blood!\"\n\nHanson grunted feebly. He didn't want attention called to himself while\nSer Perth was around. \"I--I heal quickly.\" It was no more than the\ntruth. Either the body they'd given him or the conjuring during the\nright split second had enabled him to heal almost before a blow was\nstruck.\n\n\"Magic!\" The overseer scowled and gave Hanson a shove that sent him\nsprawling. \"Blithering magic again! Magic stones that melt when you get\nthem in place--magic slaves that the whip won't touch! And they expect\nus to do a job of work such as not even Thoth could dream up! They won't\ntake honest work. No, they have to come snooping and conjuring and\ninterfering. Wheels on rollers! Tools of steel and the gods know what\ninstead of honest stone. Magic to lift things instead of honest ropes\nthat shrink and wood that swells. Magic that fails, and rush, rush, rush\nuntil I'm half ready to be tortured for falling behind, and--you! You\nwould, would you!\" His voice trailed off into a fresh roar of rage as he\ncaught sight of other slaves taking advantage of his attention to Hanson\nto relax. He raced off, brandishing the whip.\n\nHanson tried to make himself inconspicuous after that. The wounds would\nheal, and the beatings could never kill him; but there had been no\nprovision in his new body for the suppression of pain. He hungered,\nthirsted and suffered like anyone else. Maybe he was learning to take\nit, here, but not to like it.\n\nAt the expense of a hundred slaves and considerable deterioration of the\nwhips, one block of stone was in place before the sun was high overhead\nin the coppery, mottled sky. Then there was the blessing of a moment's\npause. Men were coming down the long lines, handing something to the\nslaves. Food, Hanson anticipated.\n\nHe was wrong. When the slave with the wicker basket came closer he could\nsee that the contents were not food but some powdery stuff that was\ndipped out with carved spoons into the eager hands of the slaves. Hanson\nsmelled his portion dubiously. It was cloying, sickly sweet.\n\nHashish! Or opium, heroin, hemp--Hanson was no expert. But it was\ncertainly some kind of drug. Judging by the avid way the other slaves\nwere gulping it down, each one of them had been exposed to it before.\nHanson cautiously made the pretense of swallowing his before he allowed\nit to slip through his fingers to mingle with the sand. Drug addiction\nwas obviously a convenient way to make the slaves forget their aches and\nfears, to keep them everlasting anxious to please whatever was necessary\nto make sure the precious, deadly ration never stopped.\n\nThere was still no sign of food. The pause in the labor was only for the\nlength of time it took the drug-bearing slaves to complete their task.\nTen minutes, or fifteen at the outside; then the overseers were back\nwith the orders and the lashes.\n\nThe slaves regrouped on new jobs, and Hanson found himself in a bunch of\na dozen or so. They were lashing the hauling ropes around a twelve-foot\nblock of stone; the rollers were already in place, with the crudely\nplaited ropes dangling loosely. Hanson found himself being lifted by a\ncouple of the other slaves to the shoulders of a third. His clawing\nhands caught the top of the block and the slaves below heaved him\nupward. He scrambled to the top and caught the ropes that were flung up\nto him.\n\nFrom his vantage point he saw what he had not seen before--the amazing\nsize of the construction project. This was no piffling little Gizeh\npyramid, no simple tomb for a king. Its base was measured in kilometers\ninstead of yards, and its top was going to be proportionally high,\napparently. It hardly seemed that there could be enough stone in the\nwhole world to finish the job. As far as Hanson could see, over the\nlevel sand, the ground was black with the suffering millions of slaves\nin their labor gangs.\n\nThe idiots must be trying to reach the sky with their pyramid. There\ncould be no other answer to the immense bulk planned for this structure.\nLike the pride-maddened men of Babel, they were building a sky-high\nthing of stone. It was obviously impossible, and even Menes must be\naware of that. Yet perhaps it was no more impossible than all the rest\nof the things in this impossible world.\n\nWhen the warlocks of this world had discovered that they could not solve\nthe problem of the sky, they must have gone into a state of pure\nhysteria, like a chicken dashing back and forth in front of a car. They\nhad sought through other worlds and ages for anyone with a reputation as\na builder, engineer or construction genius, without screening the\nprobability of finding an answer. The size of the ancient pyramid must\nhave been enough to sway them. They had used Hanson, Menes, Einstein,\nCagliostro--for some reason of their own, since he'd never been a\nbuilder--and probably a thousand more. And then they had half-supplied\nall of them, rather than picking the most likely few and giving full\ncooperation. Magic must have made solutions to most things so easy that\nthey no longer had the guts to try the impossible themselves. A pyramid\nseemed like a ridiculous solution, but for an incredible task, an\nimpossible solution had to be tried.\n\nAnd maybe, he thought, they'd overlooked the obvious in their own\nsystem. The solution to a problem in magic should logically be found in\nmagic, not in the methods of other worlds. His mind groped for something\nthat almost came into his consciousness--some inkling of what should\nhave been done, or how they had failed. It was probably only an idle\nfancy, but--\n\n\"Hey!\" One of the slaves below was waving at him. While Hanson looked\ndown, the slave called to another, got a shoulder to lean on, and walked\nhis way up the side of the block, pushed from below and helped by\nHanson's hands above. He was panting when he reached the top, but he\ncould still talk. \"Look, it's your skin, but you're going to be in\ntrouble if you don't get busy. Look out for that overseer up there.\nDon't just stand around when he's in sight.\" He picked up a loop of rope\nand passed it to Hanson, making a great show of hard work.\n\nHanson stared up at the overseer who was staring back at him. \"Why is he\nany worse than the rest of this crowd?\"\n\nThe slave shuddered as the dour, slow-moving overseer began walking\nstiffly toward them. \"Don't let the fact that he's an overseer fool you.\nHe's smarter than most of his kind, but just as ugly. He's a mandrake,\nand you can't afford to mess with him.\"\n\nHanson looked at the ancient, wrinkled face of the mandrake and\nshuddered. There was the complete incarnation of inhumanity in the\nthing's expression. He passed ropes around the corners until the\nmandrake turned and rigidly marched away, the blows of his whip falling\nmetronome-like on the slaves he passed. \"Thanks,\" Hanson said \"I wonder\nwhat it's like, being a true mandrake?\"\n\n\"Depends,\" the slave said easily. He was obviously more intelligent than\nmost, and better at conserving himself. \"Some mandrake-men are real. I\nmean, the magicians want somebody whom they can't just call back--direct\ntranslation of the body usually messes up the brain patterns enough to\nmake the thinkers hard to use, especially with the sky falling. So they\nget his name and some hold on his soul and then rebuild his body around\na mandrake root. They bind his soul into that, and in some ways he's\nalmost human. Sometimes they even improve on what he was. But the true\nmandrake--like that one--never was human. Just an ugly, filthy\nsimulacrum. It's bad business. I never liked it, even though I was in\ntraining for sersa rating.\"\n\n\"You're from this world?\" Hanson asked in surprise. He'd been assuming\nthat the man was one of the things called back.\n\n\"A lot of us are. They conscripted a lot of the people they didn't need\nfor these jobs. But I was a little special. All right, maybe you don't\nbelieve me--you think they wouldn't send a student sersa here now. Look,\nI can prove it. I managed to sneak one of the books I was studying back\nwith me. See?\"\n\nHe drew a thin volume from his breechclout cautiously, then slipped it\nback again. \"You don't get such books unless you're at least of student\nrating.\" He sighed, then shrugged. \"My trouble is that I could never\nkeep my mouth shut. I was attendant at one of the revivatoria, and I got\ndrunk enough to let out some information about one of the important\nrevival cases. So here I am.\"\n\n\"Umm.\" Hanson worked silently for a minute, wondering how far\ncoincidence could go. It could go a long ways here, he decided. \"You\nwouldn't have been sentenced to twenty lifetimes here by the Sather\nKarf, would you?\"\n\nThe slave stared at him in surprise. \"You guessed it. I've died only\nfourteen times so far, so I've got six more lives to go. But--hey, you\ncan't be! They were counting on you to be the one who really fixed\nthings. Don't tell me my talking out of turn did this to you.\"\n\nHanson reassured him on that. He recognized the man now for another\nreason. \"Aren't you the one I saw dead on his back right next to me this\nmorning?\"\n\n\"Probably. Name's Barg.\" He stood up to take a careful look at the net\nof cording around the stone. \"Looks sound enough. Yeah, I died this\nmorning, which is why I'm fairly fresh now. Those overseers won't feed\nus because it takes time and wastes food; they let us die and then have\nus dragged back for more work. It's a lot easier on the ones they\ndragged back already dead; dying doesn't matter so much without a soul.\"\n\n\"Some of them seem to be Indians,\" Hanson noted. He hadn't paid too\nmuch attention, but the slaves seemed to be from every possible\nbackground.\n\nBarg nodded. \"Aztecs from a place called Tenochtitlan. Twenty thousand\nof them got sacrificed in a bunch for some reason or other. Poor devils.\nThey think this is some kind of heaven. They tell me this is easy work\ncompared to the type they had to undergo. The Satheri like to get big\nbunches through in one conjuration, like the haul they made from the\nvictims of somebody named Tamerlane.\" He tested a rope, then dropped to\na sitting position on the edge of the block. \"I'll let you stay up to\ncall signals from here. Only watch it. That overseer has his eyes on\nyou. Make sure the ropes stay tight while we see if the thing can be\nmoved.\"\n\nHe started to slip over the side, hanging by his fingertips. Something\ncaught, and he swore. With one hand, he managed to free his breechclout\nand drag out the thin volume that was lodged between his groin and the\nblock. \"Here, hold this for me until we meet tonight. You've got more\nroom to hide it in your cloth than I have.\" He tossed it over quickly,\nthen dropped from sight to land on the ground below.\n\nHanson shoved the book out of sight and tried to act busy again. The\nmandrake overseer had started ponderously toward him. But in a moment\nthe thing's attention was directed to some other object of torture.\n\nHanson braced himself as the lines of slaves beneath him settled\nthemselves to the ropes. There was a loud cracking of whips and a chorus\nof groans. A small drum took up a beat, and the slaves strained and\ntugged in unison. Ever so slowly, the enormous block of stone began to\nmove, while the ropes drew tighter.\n\nHanson checked the rigging with half his mind, while the other half\nraced in a crazy circle of speculation. Mandrakes and mandrake-men,\nzombie-men, from the past and multiple revivals! A sky that fell in\ngreat chunks. What came next in this ridiculous world in which he seemed\nto be trapped?\n\nAs if in answer to his question, there was a sudden, coruscating flare\nfrom above.\n\nHanson's body reacted instinctively. His arm came up over his eyes,\ncutting off the glare. But he managed to squint across it, upwards\ntoward what was happening in the cracked dome. For a split second, he\nthought that the sun had gone nova.\n\nHe was wrong, but not by too much. Something had happened to the sun.\nNow it was flickering and flaming, shooting enormous jets of fire from\nits rim. It hovered at the edge of a great new hole and seemed to be\nwobbling, careening and losing its balance.\n\nThere was a massive shriek of fear and panic from the horde of slaves.\nThey began bellowing like the collective death-agony of a world. Most of\nthem dropped their ropes and ran in blind panic, trampling over each\nother in their random flight for safety. The human overseers were part\nof the same panic-stricken riot. Only the mandrakes stood stolidly in\nplace, flicking each running man who passed them.\n\nHanson flung himself face down on the stone. There was a roar of\ntortured air from overhead and a thundering sound that was unlike\nanything except the tearing of an infinity of cloth combined with a\nsustained explosion of atomic bombs. Then it seemed as if the\nthunderbolt of Thor himself had blasted in Hanson's ears.\n\nThe sky had ripped again, and this time the entire dome shook with the\nshock. But that wasn't the worst of it.\n\nThe sun had broken through the hole and was falling!\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nThe fall of the sun was seemingly endless. It teetered out of the hole\nand seemed to hover, spitting great gouts of flame as it encountered the\nphlogiston layer. Slowly, agonizingly, it picked up speed and began its\ndownward rush. Unlike the sky, it seemed to obey the normal laws of\ninertia Hanson had known. It swelled bit by bit, raging as it drew\nnearer. And it seemed to be heading straight for the pyramid.\n\nThe heat was already rising. It began to sear the skin long before the\nsun struck the normal atmosphere. Hanson could feel that he was being\nbaked alive. The blood in his arteries seemed to bubble and boil, though\nthat must have been an illusion. But he could see his skin rise in giant\nblisters and heal almost at once to blister again. He screamed in agony,\nand heard a million screams around him. Then the other screams began to\ndecrease in numbers and weaken in volume, and he knew that the slaves\nwere dying.\n\nThrough a slit between two fingers, he watched the ponderous descent.\nThe light was enough to sear his retinas, but even they healed faster\nthan the damage. He estimated the course of the sun, amazed to find that\nthere was no panic in him, and doubly amazed that he could think at all\nover the torture that wracked his body.\n\nFinally, convinced that the sun would strike miles to the south, he\nrolled across the scorching surface of the stone block and dropped to\nthe north side of it. The shock of landing must have broken bones, but\na moment later he could begin to breathe again. The heat was still\nintense, even behind the stone block, but it was bearable--at least for\nhim.\n\nPieces were breaking off the sun as it fell, and already striking the\nground. One fell near, and its heat seared at him, giving him no place\nof shelter. Then the sun struck, sending up earth tremors that knocked\nhim from his feet. He groped up and stared around the block.\n\nThe sun had struck near the horizon, throwing up huge masses of\nmaterial. Its hissing against the ground was a tumult in his ears, and\nsuperheated ash and debris began to fall.\n\nSo far as he could see, there were no other survivors in the camp. Three\nmillion slaves had died. Those who had found some shelter behind the\nstonework had lived longer than the others, but that had only increased\ntheir suffering. And even his body must have been close to its limits,\nif it could be killed at all.\n\nHe was still in danger. If a salamander could destroy even such a body\nas his, then the fragments of sun that were still roiling across the\nlandscape would be fatal. The only hope he had was to get as far away\nfrom the place where the sun had struck as he could.\n\nHe braced himself to leave even the partial shelter. There was a pile of\nwater skins near the base of the block, held in the charred remains of\nan attendant's body. The water was boiling, but there was still some\nleft. He poured several skins together and drank the stuff, forcing\nhimself to endure the agony of its passage down his throat. Without it,\nhe'd be dehydrated before he could get a safe distance away.\n\nThen he ran. The desert was like molten iron under his bare feet, and\nthe savage radiation on his back was worse than any overseer's whip.\nHis mind threatened to blank out with each step, but he forced himself\non. And slowly, as the distance increased, the sun's pyre sank further\nand further over the horizon. The heat should still have been enough to\nkill any normal body in fifteen minutes, but he could endure it. He\nstumbled on in a trot, guiding himself by the stars that shone in the\nbroken sky toward a section of this world where there had been life and\nsome measure of civilization before. After a few hours, the tongues of\nflame no longer flared above the horizon, though the brilliant radiance\ncontinued. And Hanson found that his strong and nearly indestructible\nbody still had limits. It could not go on without rest forever. He was\nsobbing with fatigue at every step.\n\nHe managed to dig a small hollow in the sand before dropping off to\nsleep. It was a sleep of total exhaustion, lacking even a sense of time.\nIt might have been minutes or hours that he slept, and he had no way of\nknowing which. With the sun gone and the stars rocking into dizzy new\nconfigurations, there was no night or day, nor any way to guess the\npassage of time.\n\nHe woke to a roaring wind that sent cutting blasts of sand driving\nagainst him. He staggered up and forced himself against it, away from\nthe place where the sun had fallen. Even through the lashing sandstorm,\nhe could see the glow near the horizon. Now a pillar of something that\nlooked like steam but was probably vapor from molten and evaporated\nrocks was rising upwards, like the mushroom clouds of his own days. It\nwas spreading, apparently just under the phlogiston layer, reflecting\nback the glare. And the wind was caused by the great rising column of\nsuperheated gases over the sun.\n\nHe staggered on, while the sand gave way slowly to patches of green.\nWith the sun gone and the sky falling into complete shreds, this world\nwas certainly doomed. He'd assumed that the sun of this world must be\nabove the sky, but he'd been wrong; like the other heavenly bodies, it\nhad been embedded inside the shell. He had discovered that the sky\nmaterial resisted any sudden stroke, but that other matter could be\ninterpenetrated into it, as the stars were. He had even been able to\npass his hand and arm completely through the sample. Apparently the sun\nhad passed through the sky in a similar manner.\n\nThen why hadn't the shell melted? He had no real answer. The sun must\nhave been moving fast enough so that no single spot became too hot, or\nelse the phlogiston layer somehow dissipated the heat.\n\nThe cloud of glowing stuff from the rising air column was spreading out\nnow, reflecting the light and heat back to the earth. There was a chance\nthat most of one hemisphere might retain some measure of warmth, then.\nAt least there was still light enough for him to travel safely.\n\nBy the time he was too tired to go on again, he had come to the\nbeginnings of fertile land. He passed a village, but it had been looted,\nand he skirted around it rather than stare at the ghastly ghoul-work of\nthe looters. The world was ending, but civilization seemed to have ended\nalready. Beyond it, he came to a rude house, now abandoned. He staggered\nin gratefully.\n\nFor a change, he had one piece of good luck. His first attempt at magic\nproduced food. At the sound of the snapping fingers and his\nhoarse-voiced \"abracadabra,\" a dirty pot of hot and greasy stew came\ninto existence. He had no cutlery, but his hands served well enough.\nWhen it was gone, he felt better. He wiped his hands on the\nbreechclout. Whatever the material in the cloth, it had stood the sun's\nheat almost as well as he had.\n\nThen he paused as his hand found a lump under the cloth. He drew out the\napprentice magician's book. The poor devil had never achieved his twenty\nlifetimes, and this was probably all that was left of him. Hanson stared\nat it, reading the title in some surprise.\n\n_Applied Semantics._\n\nHe propped himself up and began to scan it, wondering what it had to do\nwith magic. He'd had a course of semantics in college and could see no\nrelationship. But he soon found that there were differences.\n\nThis book began with the axiomatic statement that the symbol is the\nthing. From that it developed in great detail the fact that any part of\na whole bearing similarity to the whole was also the whole; that each\nseven was the class of all sevens; and other details of the science of\nmagical similarity followed quite logically from the single axiom.\nHanson was surprised to find that there was a highly developed logic to\nit. Once he accepted the axiom--and he was no longer prepared to doubt\nit here--he could follow the book far better than he'd been able to\nfollow his own course in semantics. Apparently this was supposed to be a\ndifficult subject, from the constant efforts of the writer to make his\npoint clear. But after learning to deal with electron holes in\ntransistors, this was elementary study for Hanson.\n\nThe second half of the book dealt with the use of the true name. That,\nof course, was the perfect symbol, and hence the true whole. There was\nthe simple ritual of giving a secret name. Apparently any man who\ndiscovered a principle or device could use a name for it, just as\nparents could give one to their children. And there were the laws for\nusing the name. Unfortunately, just when Hanson was beginning to make\nsome sense of it, the book ended. Obviously, there was a lot more to be\ncovered in later courses.\n\nHe tossed the book aside, shivering as he realized that his secret name\nwas common knowledge. The wonder was that he could exist at all. And\nwhile there was supposed to be a ritual for relinquishing one name and\ntaking another, that was one of the higher mysteries not given.\n\nIn the morning, he stopped to magic up some more food and the clothing\nhe would need if he ever found the trace of civilized people again. The\nfood was edible, though he'd never particularly liked cereal. He seemed\nto be getting the hang of abracadabraing up what was in his mind. But\nthe clothing was a problem. Everything he got turned out to be the right\nsize, but he couldn't see himself in hauberk and greaves, nor in a filmy\nnightgown. Finally, he managed something that was adequate, if the\nbrilliant floral sportshirt could be said to go with levi pants and a\nmorning frock. But he felt somewhat better in it. He finally left the\nfrock behind, however. It was still too hot for that.\n\nHe walked on briskly, watching for signs of life and speculating on the\nprinciples of applied semantics, name magic and similarity. He could\nbegin to understand how an Einstein might read through one of the\nadvanced books here and make leaps in theory beyond what the Satheri had\ndeveloped. They'd had it too easy. Magic that worked tended to overcome\nthe drive for the discipline needed to get the most out of it. Any good\ntheoretician from Hanson's world could probably make fools of these\npeople. Maybe that was why the Satheri had gone scrounging back through\nother worlds to find men who had the necessary drive to get things done\nwhen the going was tough.\n\nTwice he passed abandoned villages, but there was nothing there for him.\nHe was coming toward forested ground now, something like the country in\nwhich the Sons of the Egg had found refuge. The thought of that made him\ngo slower. But for a long time, there was no further sign of life. The\nwoods thinned out to grasslands, and he went on for hours more before he\nspotted a cluster of lights ahead.\n\nAs he drew nearer, he saw that the lights seemed to be fluorescents.\nThey were coming from corrugated iron sheds that looked like aircraft\nhangars strung together. There was a woven-wire fence around the\nstructures, and a sign that said simply: _Project Eighty-Five_. In the\nhalf-light from the sky, he could see a well-kept lawn, and there were a\nfew groups of men standing about idly. Most wore white coveralls, though\ntwo were dressed in simple business suits.\n\nHanson moved forward purposefully, acting as if he had urgent business.\nIf he stopped, there would be questions, he suspected; he wanted to find\nanswers, not to answer idle questions.\n\nThere was no one at the desk in the little reception alcove, but he\nheard the sound of voices through a side door leading out. He went\nthrough it, to find a larger yard with more men idling. There should be\nsomeone here who knew more of what was going on in this world than he\ndid now.\n\nHis choice, in the long run, seemed to lie between Bork and the Satheri,\nunless he could find some way of hiding himself from both sides. At the\nmoment, he was relatively free for the first time since they had brought\nhim here, and he wanted to make sure that he could make the most use of\nthe fact.\n\nNobody asked anything. He slowed, drifting along the perimeter of the\ngroup of men, and still nobody paid him any attention. Finally, he\ndropped onto the ground near a group of half a dozen men who looked more\nalert than the rest. They seemed to be reminiscing over old times.\n\n     \"--two thirty-eight an hour with overtime--and double time for\n     the swing shift. We really had it made then! And every\n     Saturday, never fail, the general would come out from Muroc and\n     tell us we were the heros of the home front--with overtime pay\n     while we listened to him!\"\n\n     \"Yeah, but what if you wanted to quit? Suppose you didn't like\n     your shift boss or somebody? You go down and get your time, and\n     they hand you your draft notice. Me, I liked it better in '46.\n     Not so much pay, but--\"\n\nHanson pricked up his ears. The conversation told him more than he\nneeded to know. He stood up and peered through the windows of the shed.\nThere, unattended under banks of lights, stood half-finished aircraft\nshapes.\n\nHe wouldn't get much information here, it seemed. These were obviously\nreanimates, men who'd been pulled from his own world and set to work.\nThey could do their duties and their memories were complete, but they\nwere lacking some essential thing that had gone out of them before they\nwere brought here. Unless he could find one among them who was either a\nmandrake-man housing a soul or one of the few reanimates who seemed\nalmost fully human, he'd get little information. But he was curious as\nto what the Satheri had expected to do with aircraft. The rocs had\nbetter range and altitude than any planes of equal hauling power.\n\nHe located one man who seemed a little brighter than the others. The\nfellow was lying on the ground, staring at the sky with his hands\nclasped behind his head. From time to time, he frowned, as if the sight\nof the sky was making him wonder. The man nodded as Hanson dropped down\nbeside him. \"Hi. Just get here, Mac?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Hanson assented. \"What's the score?\"\n\nThe man sat up and made a disgusted noise. \"Who knows?\" he answered.\nThere was more emotion in his voice than might be expected from a\nreanimate; in real life on his own world, he must have had an amazing\npotential for even that much to carry over. \"We're dead. We're dead, and\nwe're here, and they tell us to make helicopters. So we make them,\nworking like dogs to make a deadline. Then, just as the first one comes\noff the line, the power fails. No more juice. The head engineer took off\nin the one we finished. He was going to find out what gives, but he\nnever came back. So we sit.\" He spat on the ground. \"I wish they'd left\nme dead after the plant blew up. I'm not myself since then.\"\n\n\"What in hell would they need with helicopters?\" Hanson asked.\n\nThe man shrugged. \"Beats me. But I'm beginning to figure some things\nout. They've got some kind of trouble with the sky. I figure they got\nconfused in bringing us here. This shop is one that made those big cargo\ncopters they call 'Sky Hooks' and maybe they thought the things were\njust what they're called. All I know is they kept us working five solid\nweeks for nothing. I knew the power was going to fail; they had the\ncraziest damn generating plant you ever saw, and it couldn't last. The\nboilers kept sizzling and popping their safety valves with no fire in\nthe box! Just some little old man sitting in a corner, practicing the\nMasonic grip or something over a smudgepot.\"\n\nHanson gestured back to the sheds. \"If there's no power, what are those\nlights?\"\n\n\"Witch lights, they told us,\" the man explained. \"Saved a lot of wiring,\nor something. They--hey, what's that?\"\n\nHe was looking up, and Hanson followed his gaze. There was something\nwhizzing overhead at jet-plane speed. \"A piece of the sky falling?\" he\nsaid.\n\nThe man snorted. \"Falling sidewise? Not likely, even here. I tell you,\npal, I don't like this place. Nothing works right. There was no fuel for\nthe 'copter we finished--the one we called Betsy Ann. But the little\ngeezer who worked the smudgepot just walked up to it and wiggled his\nfinger. 'Start your motor going, Betsy Ann,' he ordered with some other\nmumbo-jumbo. Then the motor roared and he and the engineer, took off at\ndouble the speed she could make on high-test gas. Hey, there it is\nagain! Doesn't look like the Betsy Ann coming back, either.\"\n\nThe something whizzed by again, in the other direction, but lower and\nslower. It made a gigantic but erratic circle beyond the sheds and\nswooped back. It looked nothing like a helicopter. It looked like a\nHallowe'en decoration of a woman on a broomstick. As it came nearer,\nHanson saw that it _was_ a woman on a broomstick, flying erratically.\nShe straightened out in a flat glide.\n\nShe came in for a one-point landing a couple of yards away. The tip of\nthe broom handle hit the ground, and she went sailing over it, to land\non her hands and knees. She got up, facing the shed.\n\nThe woman was Nema. Her face was masklike, her eyes tortured. She was\nstaring searchingly around her, looking at every man.\n\n\"Nema!\" Hanson cried.\n\nShe spun to face him, and gasped. Her skin seemed to turn gray, and her\neyes opened to double their normal size. She took one tottering step\ntoward him and halted.\n\n\"Illusion!\" she whispered hoarsely, and slumped to the ground in a\nfaint.\n\nShe was reviving before he could raise her from the ground. She swayed a\nmoment, staring at him. \"You're not dead!\"\n\n\"What's so wonderful about that around here?\" he asked, but not with\nmuch interest. With the world going to pot and only a few days left, the\ngirl's face and the slim young body under it were about all the reality\nleft worth thinking about. He grabbed for her, pulling her to him.\nBertha had never made him feel like that.\n\nShe managed to avoid his lips and slid away from him. \"But they used the\nsnetha-knife! Dave Hanson, you never died! It was only induced illusion\nby that--that Bork! And to think that I nearly died of grief while you\nwere enjoying yourself here! You ... you mandrake-man!\"\n\nHe grunted. He'd almost managed to forget what he was, and he didn't\nenjoy having the aircraft worker find out. He turned to see what the\nreaction was, and then stared open-mouthed at his surroundings.\n\nThere were no lights from the plane factory. In fact, there was no plane\nfactory. In the half-light of the sky, he saw that the plant was gone.\nNo men were left. There was only barren earth, with a tiny, limp sapling\nin the middle of empty acres.\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\nNema glanced around briefly and sighed. \"It's happening all over. They\ncreated the plane plant by the law of identities from that little plane\ntree sapling, I suppose; it is a plane plant, after all. But with the\nconjunctions and signs failing, all such creations are returning to\ntheir original form, unless a spell is used continually over them. Even\nthen, sometimes, we fail. Most of the projects vanished after the sun\nfell.\"\n\nHanson remembered the man with whom he'd been talking before Nema\nappeared. He'd have liked to know such a man before death and\nrevivification had ruined him. It wasn't fair that anyone with character\nenough to be that human even as a zombie should be wiped out without\neven a moment's consideration. Then he remembered the man's own estimate\nof his current situation. Maybe he was better off returned to the death\nthat had claimed him.\n\nReluctantly, he returned to his own problems. \"All right, then, if you\nthought I was dead, what are you doing here, Nema?\"\n\n\"I felt the compulsion begin even before I returned to the city. I\nthought I was going mad. I tried to forget you, but the compulsion grew\nuntil I could fight it no longer.\" She shuddered. \"It was a terrible\nflight. The carpets will not work at all now, and I could hardly control\nthe broom. Sometimes it wouldn't lift. Twice it sailed so high I could\nhardly breathe. And I had no hope of finding you, yet I went on. I've\nbeen flying when I could for three days now.\"\n\nBork, of course, hadn't known of her spell with which she'd forced\nherself to want him \"well and truly.\" Apparently it had gone on\noperating even when she thought he was dead, and with a built-in sense\nof his direction. Well, she was here--and he wasn't sorry.\n\nHanson took another look across the plains toward the glowing hell of\nthe horizon. He reached for her and pulled her to him. She was firm and\nsweet against him, and she was trembling in response to his urging.\n\nAt the last moment she pulled back. \"You forget yourself, Dave Hanson!\nI'm a registered and certified virgin. My blood is needed for--\"\n\n\"For spells that won't work anyhow,\" he told her harshly. \"The sky isn't\nfalling now, kid. It's down--or most of it.\"\n\n\"But--\" She hesitated and then let herself come a trifle closer. Her\nvoice was doubtful. \"It's true that our spells are failing. Not even the\nsurest magic is reliable. The world has gone mad, and even magic is no\nlonger trustworthy. But--\"\n\nHe was just pulling her close enough again and feeling her arms lift to\nhis neck when the ground shook behind them and there was a sound of\ngreat, jarring, thudding steps.\n\nHanson jerked around to see a great roc making its landing run, heading\nstraight for them. The huge bird braked savagely, barely stopping before\nthey were under its feet.\n\nFrom its back, a ladder of some flexible material snaked down and men\nbegan descending. The first were mandrakes in the uniform of the\nSatheri, all carrying weapons with evil-looking blades or sharp\nstickers.\n\nThe last man off was Bork. He came toward Hanson and Nema with a broad\ngrin on his face. \"Greetings, Dave Hanson. You do manage to survive,\ndon't you? And my little virgin sister, without whose flight I might not\nhave found you. Well, come along. The roc's growing impatient!\"\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nThe great roc's hard-drumming wings set up a constant sound of rushing\nair and the distance flowed behind them. There was the rush of wind all\naround them, but on the bird's back they were in an area where\neverything seemed calm. Only when Hanson looked over toward the ground\nwas he fully conscious of the speed they were making. From the height,\nhe could see where the sun had landed. It was sinking slowly into the\nearth, lying in a great fused hole. For miles around, smaller drops of\nthe three-mile-diameter sun had spattered and were etching deeper holes\nin the pitted landscape.\n\nThen they began passing over desolate country, scoured by winds, gloomy\nfrom the angry, glaring clouds above. Once, two bodies went hurtling\nupwards toward the great gaps in the sky.\n\n\"Those risings were from men who were no worshippers of the egg's\nhatching,\" Bork commented. \"It's spreading. Something is drawing them up\nfrom all over the planet.\"\n\nLater, half a square mile of the shell cracked off. The roc squawked\nharshly, but it had learned and had been watching above. By a frantic\neffort of the great wings, it missed the hurtling chunk. They dropped a\nfew thousand feet in the winds that followed the piece of sky, but their\naltitude was still safe.\n\nThen they passed over a town, flying low. The sights below were out of a\nghoul's bacchanalia. As the roc swept over, the people stopped their\nfrenzied pursuit of sensation and ran for weapons. A cloud of arrows\nhissed upwards, all fortunately too late.\n\n\"They blame all their troubles on the magicians,\" Bork explained.\n\"They've been shooting at everything that flies. Not a happy time to\nassociate with the Satheri, is it?\"\n\nNema drew further back from him. \"We're not all cowards like you! Only\nrats desert a sinking ship.\"\n\n\"Nobody thought it was sinking when I deserted,\" Bork reminded her.\n\"Anyhow, if you'd been using your eyes and seen the way we are\ntraveling, you'd know I've rejoined the crew. I've made up with the\nSather Karf--and at a time like this, our great grandfather was glad to\nhave me back!\"\n\nNema rushed toward him in delight, but Hanson wasn't convinced. \"Why?\"\nhe asked.\n\nBork sobered. \"One of the corpses that fell back from the risings added\na word to what the others had said. No, I'll bear the weight of it\nmyself, and not burden you with it. But I'm convinced now that his egg\nshould not hatch. I had doubts before, unlike our friend Malok, who also\nheard the words but is doubly the fanatic now. Perhaps the hatching\ncannot be stopped--but I've decided that I am a man and must fight like\none against the fates. So, though I still oppose much that the Satheri\nhave done, I've gone back to them. We'll be at the camp of the Sather\nKarf shortly.\"\n\nThat sewed everything up neatly, Hanson thought. Before, he had been\ntorn between two alternatives. Now there was only one and he had no\nchoice; he could never trust the Sons of the Egg with Bork turned\nagainst them. He stared up at the sky, realizing that more than half of\nit had already fallen. The rest seemed too weak to last much longer. It\nprobably didn't make much difference what he did now or who had him;\ntime was running out for this world.\n\nThe light was dimmer by the time they reached the great capital city--or\nwhat was left of it. They had left the sun pyre far to the south. The\nair was growing cold already.\n\nThe roc flew low over the city. The few people on the streets looked up\nand made threatening gestures, but there was no flight of arrows from\nthe ground. Probably the men below had lost even the strength to hate.\nIt was hard to see, since there was no electric lighting system now. But\nit seemed to Hanson that only the oldest and ugliest buildings were\nstill standing. Honest stone and metal could survive, but the work of\nmagic was no longer safe.\n\nOne of the remaining buildings seemed to be a hospital, and the empty\nspace in front of it was crammed with people. Most of them seemed to be\ndead or unconscious. Squat mandrakes were carrying off bodies toward a\ngreat fire that was burning in another square. Plague and pestilence had\napparently gotten out of hand.\n\nThey flew on, beyond the city toward the construction camp that had been\nHanson's headquarters. The roc was beginning to drop into a long landing\nglide, and details below were easier to see. Along the beach beyond the\ncity, a crowd had collected. They had a fire going and were preparing to\ncook one of the mermaids. A fight was already going on over the prey.\nFood must have been exhausted days before.\n\nThe camp was a mess when they reached it. One section had been ripped\ndown by the lash of wind from a huge piece of the sky, which now lay\namong the ruins with a few stars glowing inside it. There was a\nbrighter glow beyond. Apparently one blob of material from the sun had\nbeen tossed all the way here and had landed against a huge rock to\nspatter into fragments. The heat from those fragments cut through the\nchill in the air, and the glow furnished light for most of the camp.\n\nThe tents had been burned, but there was a new building where the main\ntent had been. This was obviously a hasty construction job, thrown\ntogether of rocks and tree trunks, without the use of magic. It was more\nof an enormous lean-to than a true building, but it was the best\nprotection now available. Hanson could see Sather Karf and Sersa Garm\nwaiting outside, together with less than a hundred other warlocks.\n\nThe mandrakes prodded Hanson down from the roc and toward the new\nbuilding, then left at a wave of the Sather Karf's hand. The old man\nstared at Hanson intently, but his expression was unreadable. He seemed\nto have aged a thousand years. Finally he lifted his hand in faint\ngreeting, sighed and dropped slowly to a seat. His face seemed to\ncollapse, with the iron running out of it. He looked like a beaten, sick\nold man. His voice was toneless. \"Fix the sky, Dave Hanson!\"\n\nThere were angry murmurs from other warlocks in the background, but\nSather Karf shook his head slowly, still facing Hanson. \"No--what good\nto threaten dire punishments or to torture you when another day or week\nwill see the end of everything? What good to demand your reasons for\ndesertion when time is so short? Fix the sky and claim what reward you\nwill afterwards. We have few powers now that the basis of astrology is\nruined. But repair our sky and we can reward you beyond your dreams. We\ncan find ways to return you to your own world intact. You have near\nimmortality now. We can fill that entire lifetime with pleasures. We'll\ngive you jewels to buy an empire. Or if it is vengeance against whatever\nyou feel we are, you shall know my secret name and the name of everyone\nhere. Do with us then what you like. _But fix the sky!_\"\n\nIt shook Hanson. He had been prepared to face fury, or to try lying his\nway out if there was a chance with some story of having needed to study\nMenes's methods. Or of being lost. But he had no defense prepared\nagainst such an appeal.\n\nIt was utterly mad. He could do nothing, and their demands were\nimpossible. But before the picture of the world dying and the decay of\nthe old Sather's pride, even Hanson's own probable death with the dying\nworld seemed unimportant. He might at least give them something to hope\nfor while the end came.\n\n\"Maybe,\" he said slowly. \"Maybe, if all of the men you brought here to\nwork on the problem were to pool their knowledge, we might still find\nthe answer. How long will it take to get them here for a council?\"\n\nSer Perth appeared from the group. Hanson had thought the man dead in\nthe ruins of the pyramid, but somehow he had survived. The fat was going\nfrom his face, and his mustache was untrimmed, but he was uninjured. He\nshook his head sadly. \"Most have disappeared with their projects. Two\nescaped us. Menes is dead. Cagliostro tricked us successfully. You are\nall we have left. And we can't even supply labor beyond those you see\nhere. The people no longer obey us, since we have no food to give them.\"\n\n\"You're the only hope,\" Bork agreed. \"They've saved what they could of\nthe tools from the camp and what magical instruments are still useful.\nThey've held on only for your return.\"\n\nHanson stared at them and around at the collection of bric-a-brac and\nmachinery they had assembled for him. He opened his mouth, and his\nlaughter was a mockery of their hopes and of himself.\n\n\"Dave Hanson, world saver! You got the right name but the wrong man,\nSather Karf,\" he said bitterly. He'd been a pretender long enough, and\nwhat punitive action they took now didn't seem to matter. \"You wanted my\nuncle, David Arnold Hanson. But because his friends called him Dave and\ncut that name on his monument, and because I was christened by the name\nyou called, you got me instead. He'd have been helpless here, probably,\nbut with me you have no chance. I couldn't even build a doghouse. I\nwasn't even a construction engineer. Just a computer operator and\nrepairman.\"\n\nHe regretted ruining their hopes, almost as he said it. But he could see\nno change on the old Sather's face. It seemed to stiffen slightly and\nbecome more thoughtful, but there was no disappointment.\n\n\"My grandson Bork told me all that,\" he said. \"Yet your name was on the\nmonument, and we drew you back by its use. Our ancient prophecy declared\nthat we should find omnipotence carved on stone in a pool of water, as\nwe found your name. Therefore, by the laws of rational magic, it is\n_you_ to whom nothing is impossible. We may have mistaken the direction\nof your talent, but nonetheless it is you who must fix the sky. What\nform of wonder is a computer?\"\n\nDave shook his head at the old man's monomania. \"Just a tool. It's a\nlittle hard to explain, and it couldn't help.\"\n\n\"Humor my curiosity, then. What is a computer, Dave Hanson?\"\n\nNema's hand rested on Hanson's arm pleadingly, and he shrugged. He\ngroped about for some answer that could be phrased in their language,\nletting his mind flicker from the modern electronic gadgets back to the\nold-time tide predicter.\n\n\"An analogue computer is a machine that ... that sets up conditions\nmathematically similar to the conditions in some problem and then lets\nall the operations proceed while it draws a graph--a prediction--of how\nthe real conditions would turn out. If the tides change with the\nposition of some heavenly body, then we can build cams that have shapes\nlike the effect of the moon's orbit, and gear them together in the right\norder. If there are many factors, we have a cam for each factor, shaped\nlike the periodic rise and fall of that factor. They're all geared to\nlet the various factors operate at the proper relative rate. With such a\nmachine, we can run off a graph of the tides for years ahead. Oh,\nhell--it's a lot more complicated than that, but it takes the basic\nfacts and draws a picture of the results. We use electronic ones now,\nbut the results are the same.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Sather Karf said. Dave doubted it, but he was happy to\nbe saved from struggling with a more detailed explanation. And maybe the\nold man did understand some of it. He was no fool in his own subject,\ncertainly. Sather Karf pondered for a moment, and then nodded with\napparent satisfaction. \"Your world was more advanced in understanding\nthan I had thought. This computer is a fine scientific instrument,\nobeying natural law well. We have applied the same methods, though less\nelaborately. But the basic magical principle of similarity is the\nfoundation of true science.\"\n\nDave started to protest, and then stopped, frowning. In a way, what the\nother had said was true. Maybe there was some relation between science\nand magic, after all; there might even be a meeting ground between the\nlaws of the two worlds he knew. Computers set up similar conditions,\nwith the idea that the results would apply to the original. Magic used\nsome symbolic part of a thing in manipulations that were to be effective\nfor the real thing. The essential difference was that science was\npredictive and magic was effective--though the end results were often\nthe same. On Dave's world, the cardinal rule of logic was that the\nsymbol was not the thing--and work done on symbols had to be translated\nby hard work into reality. Maybe things were really more logical here\nwhere the symbol was the thing, and all the steps in between thought and\nresult were saved.\n\n\"So we are all at fault,\" Sather Karf said finally. \"We should have\nstudied you more deeply and you should have been more honest with us.\nThen we could have obtained a computer for you and you could have\nsimulated our sky as it should be within your computer and forced it to\nbe repaired long ago. But there's no time for regrets now. We cannot\nhelp you, so you must help yourself. Build a computer, Dave Hanson!\"\n\n\"It's impossible.\"\n\nSudden rage burned on the old man's face, and he came to his feet. His\narm jerked back and snapped forward. Nothing happened. He grimaced at\nthe ruined sky. \"Dave Hanson,\" he cried sharply, \"by the unfailing power\nof your name which is all of you, I hold you in my mind and your throat\nis in my hand--\"\n\nThe old hands squeezed suddenly, and Hanson felt a vise clamp down\naround his throat. He tried to break free, but there was no escape. The\nold man mumbled, and the vise was gone, but something clawed at Hanson's\nliver. Something else rasped across his sciatic nerve. His kidneys\nseemed to be wrenched out of him.\n\n\"You will build a computer,\" Sather Karf ordered. \"And you _will_ save\nour world!\"\n\nHanson staggered from the shock of the pain, but he was no longer unused\nto agony. He had spent too many hours under the baking of the sun, the\nagony of the snetha-knife and the lash of an overseer's whip. The agony\ncould not be stopped, but he'd learned it could be endured. His\nfantastic body could heal itself against whatever they did to him, and\nhis mind refused to accept the torture supinely. He took a step toward\nSather Karf, and another. His hands came up as he moved forward.\n\nBork laughed suddenly. \"Let up, Sather Karf, or you'll regret it. By the\nlaws, you're dealing with a _man_ this time. Let up, or I'll free him to\nmeet you fairly.\"\n\nThe old man's eyes blazed hotly. Then he sighed and relaxed. The\nclutching hands and the pain were gone from Hanson as the Sather Karf\nslumped back wearily to his seat.\n\n\"Fix our sky,\" the old man said woodenly.\n\nHanson staggered back, panting from his efforts. But he nodded. \"All\nright,\" he agreed. \"Like Bork, I think a man has to fight against his\nfate, no matter how little chance he has. I'll do what I can. I'll build\nthe damned computer. But when I'm finished, I'll wait for _your_ true\nname!\"\n\nSuddenly Sather Karf laughed. \"Well said, Dave Hanson. You'll have my\nname when the time comes. And whatever else you desire. Also what poor\nhelp we can give you now. Ser Perth, bring food for Dave Hanson!\"\n\nSer Perth shook his head sadly. \"There is none. None at all. We hoped\nthat the remaining planets would find a favorable conjunction, but--\"\n\nDave Hanson studied his helpers with more bitterness. \"Oh, hell!\" he\nsaid at last. He snapped his fingers. \"Abracadabra!\"\n\nHis skill must be improving, since he got exactly what he had wished\nfor. A full side of beef materialized against his palm, almost breaking\nhis arm before he could snap it out of the way. The others swarmed\nhungrily toward it. At their expressions of wonder, Hanson felt more\nconfidence returning to him. He concentrated and went through the little\nritual again. This time loaves of bread rained down--fresh bread, and\neven of the brand he had wished for. Maybe he was becoming a magician\nhimself, with a new magic that might still accomplish something.\n\nSather Karf smiled approvingly. \"The theory of resonance, I see.\nUnreliable generally. More of an art than a science. But you show\npromise of remarkable natural ability to apply it.\"\n\n\"You know about it?\" Dave had assumed that it was completely outside\ntheir experience and procedures.\n\n\"We _knew_ it. But when more advanced techniques took over, most of us\nforgot it. The syllables resonate in a sound pattern with your world, to\nwhich you also still resonate. It won't work for you with anything from\nthis world, nor will anything work thus for us from yours. We had\ndifferent syllables, of course, for use here.\" Sather Karf considered\nit. \"But if you can control it and bring in one of your computers or the\nparts for one--\"\n\nSixteen tries later, Dave was cursing as he stared at a pile of useless\nitems. He'd gotten transistors at first. Then he lost control with too\nmuch tension or fatigue and began getting a bunch of assorted junk, such\nas old 201-A tubes, a transit, a crystal vase and resistors. But the\nchief trouble was that he couldn't secure working batteries. He had\nmanaged a few, but all were dead.\n\n\"Like the soul, electrical charges will not transfer,\" Sather Karf\nagreed sadly. \"I should have told you that.\"\n\nThere was no electricity here with which to power anything, and their\nspells could not be made to work now. Even if he could build a computer\nout of what was obtainable, there would be no way to power it.\n\nOverhead, the sky shattered with a roar, and another piece fell, tearing\ndownwards toward the city. Sersa Garm stared upwards in horror.\n\n\"Mars!\" he croaked. \"Mars has fallen. Now can there be no conjunction\never!\"\n\nHe tautened and his body rose slowly from the ground. A scream ripped\nfrom his lips and faded away as he began rushing upwards with increasing\nspeed. He passed but of their sight, straight toward the new hole in the\nsky.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nIn the hours that followed, Dave's vague plans changed a dozen times as\nhe found each idea unworkable. His emotional balance was also\nerratic--though that was natural, since the stars were completely\nberserk in what was left of the sky. He seemed to fluctuate between\nbitter sureness of doom and a stupidly optimistic belief that something\ncould be done to avert that doom. But whatever his mood, he went on\nworking and scheming furiously. Maybe it was the desperate need to keep\nhimself occupied that drove him, or perhaps it was the pleading he saw\nin the eyes around him. In the end, determination conquered his\npessimism.\n\nSomewhere in the combination of the science he had learned in his own\nworld and the technique of magic that applied here there had to be an\nanswer--or a means to hold back the end of the world until an answer\ncould be found.\n\nThe biggest problem was the number of factors with which he had to deal.\nThere were seven planets and the sun, and three thousand fixed stars.\nAll had to be ordered in their courses, and the sky had to be complete\nin his calculations.\n\nHe had learned his trade where the answer was always to add one more\ncircuit in increasing complexity. Now he had to think of the simplest\npossible similarity computer. Electronics was out, obviously. He tried\nto design a set of cams, like the tide machine, to make multiple\ntracings on paper similar to a continuous horoscope, but finally gave\nit up. They couldn't build the parts, even if there had been time.\n\nHe had to depend on what was available, since magic couldn't produce any\nneeded device and since the people here had depended on magic too long\nto develop the other necessary skills. When only the broadest powers of\nmagic remained, they were hopeless. Names were still potent, resonance\nworked within its limits, and the general principles of similarity still\napplied; but those were not enough for them. They depended too heavily\non the second great principle of contagion, and that seemed to be\nwrapped up with some kind of association through the signs and houses\nand the courses of the planets.\n\nHe found himself thinking in circles of worry and pulled himself back to\nhis problem. Normally, a computer was designed for flexibility and to\nhandle varying conditions. This one could be designed to handle only one\nset of factors. It had to duplicate the courses of the objects in their\nsky and simulate the general behavior of the dome. It was not necessary\nto allow for all theoretical courses, but only for the normal orbits.\n\nAnd finally he realized that he was thinking of a model--the one thing\nwhich is functionally the perfect analogue.\n\nIt brought him back to magic again. Make a doll like a man and stick\npins in it--and the man dies. Make a model of the universe within the\nsky, and any changes in that should change reality. The symbol was the\nthing, and a model was obviously a symbol.\n\nHe began trying to plan a model with three thousand stars in their\norbits, trying to find some simple way of moving them. The others\nwatched in fascination. They apparently felt that the diagrams he was\ndrawing were some kind of scientific spell. Ser Perth was closer than\nthe others, studying the marks he made. The man suddenly pointed to his\ncomputations.\n\n\"Over and over I find the figure seven and the figure three thousand. I\nassume that the seven represents the planets. But what is the other\nfigure?\"\n\n\"The stars,\" Hanson told him impatiently.\n\nSer Perth shook his head. \"That is wrong. There were only two thousand\nseven hundred and eighty-one before the beginnings of our trouble.\"\n\n\"And I suppose you've got the exact orbits of every one?\" Hanson asked.\nHe couldn't see that the difference was going to help much.\n\n\"Naturally. They are fixed stars, which means they move with the sky.\nOtherwise, why call them fixed stars? Only the sun and the planets move\nthrough the sky. The stars move with the sky over the world as a unity.\"\n\nDave grunted at his own stupidity. That really simplified things, since\nit meant only one control for all of them and the sky itself. But\ndesigning a machine to handle the planets and the sun, while a lot\nsimpler, was still a complex problem. With time, it would have been easy\nenough, but there was no time for trial and error.\n\nHe ripped up his plans and began a new set. He'd need a glass sphere\nwith dots on it for the stars, and some kind of levers to move the\nplanets and sun. It would be something like the orreries he'd seen used\nfor demonstrations of planetary movement.\n\nSer Perth came over again, staring down at the sketch. He drowned in\ndoubt. \"Why waste time drawing such engines? If you want a model to\ndetermine how the orbits should be, we have the finest orrery ever built\nhere in the camp. We brought it with us when we moved, since it would be\nneeded to determine how the sky should be repaired and to bring the time\nand the positions into congruence. Wait!\"\n\nHe dashed off, calling two of the mandrakes after him. In a few minutes,\nthey staggered back under a bulky affair in a protective plastic case.\nSer Perth stripped off the case to reveal the orrery to Hanson.\n\nIt was a beautiful piece of workmanship. There was an enormous sphere of\nthin crystal to represent the sky. Precious gems showed the stars,\naffixed to the dome. The whole was nearly eight feet in diameter. Inside\nthe crystal, Hanson could see a model of the world on jeweled-bearing\nsupports. The planets and the sun were set on tracks around the outside,\nwith a clockwork drive mechanism that moved them by means of stranded\nspiderweb cords. Power came from weights, like those used on an\nold-fashioned clock. It was obviously all hand work, which must make it\na thing of tremendous value here.\n\n\"Sather Fareth spent his life designing this,\" Ser Perth said proudly.\n\"It is so well designed that it can show the position of all things for\na thousand centuries in the past or future by turning these cranks on\nthe control, or it will hold the proper present positions for years from\nits own engine.\"\n\n\"It's beautiful workmanship,\" Hanson told him. \"As good as the best done\non my world.\"\n\nSer Perth went away, temporarily pleased with himself, and Hanson stood\nstaring at the model. It was as good as he'd said it was--and completely\ndamning to all of his theories and hopes. No model he could make would\nequal it. But in spite of it and all its precise analogy to the universe\naround him, the sky was still falling in shattered bits!\n\nSather Karf and Bork had come over to join Hanson. They waited\nexpectantly, but Hanson could think of nothing to do. It had already\nbeen done--and had failed. The old man dropped a hand on his shoulder.\nThere was the weight of all his centuries on the Sather, yet a curious\ntoughness showed through his weariness. \"What is wrong with the orrery?\"\nhe asked.\n\n\"Nothing--nothing at all, damn it!\" Hanson told him. \"You wanted a\ncomputer--and you've got it. You can feed in data as to the hour, day,\nmonth and year, turn the cranks, and the planets there will turn to\ntheir proper position exactly as the real planets should run. You don't\nneed to read the results off graph paper. What more could any analogue\ncomputer do? But it doesn't influence the sky.\"\n\n\"It was never meant to,\" the old man said, surprise in his voice. \"Such\npower--\"\n\nThen he stopped, staring at Hanson while something almost like awe\nspread over his face. \"Yet ... the prophecy and the monument were right!\nYou have unlocked the impossible! Yet you seem to know nothing of the\nlaws of similarity or of magic, Dave Hanson. Is that crystal similar to\nthe sky, by association, by contagion, or by true symbolism? A part may\nbe a symbol for the whole--or so may any designated symbol, which may\ninfluence the thing it is. If I have a hair from your head, I can model\nyou with power over you. But not with the hair of a pig! That is no true\nsymbol!\"\n\n\"Suppose we substituted bits of the real thing for these\nrepresentations?\" Hanson asked.\n\nBork nodded. \"It might work. I've heard you found the sky material could\nbe melted, and we've got enough of that where it struck the camp. Any\none of us who has studied elementary alchemy could blow a globe of it to\nthe right size for the sky dome. And there are a few stars from which we\ncan chip pieces enough. We can polish them and put them into the sphere\nwhere they belong. And it will be risky, but we may even be able to\nshape a bit of the sun stuff to represent the great orb in the sky.\"\n\n\"What about the planets?\" Hanson was beginning to feel the depression\nlift. \"You might get a little of Mars, since it fell near here, but that\nstill leaves the other six.\"\n\n\"That long associated with a thing achieves the nature of the thing,\"\nSather Karf intoned, as if giving a lesson to a kindergarten student.\n\"With the right colors, metals and bits of jewels--as well as more\nsecret symbols--we can simulate the planets. Yet they cannot be\nsuspended above the dome, as in this orrery--they must be within the\nsky, as in nature.\"\n\n\"How about putting some iron in each and using a magnet on the control\ntracks to move the planets?\" Hanson suggested. \"Or does cold iron ruin\nyour conjuring here?\"\n\nSather Karf snorted in obvious disgust, but Bork only grinned. \"Why\nshould it? You must have heard peasant superstitions. Still, you'd have\na problem if two tracks met, as they do. The magnets would then affect\nboth planets alike. Better make two identical planets for each--and two\nsuns--and put one on your track controls. Then one must follow the\nother, though the one remain within the sky.\"\n\nHanson nodded. He'd have to shield the cord from the sun stuff, but that\ncould be done. He wondered idly whether the real universe was going to\nwind up with tracks beyond the sky on which little duplicate planets\nran--just how much similarity would there be between model and reality\nwhen this was done, if it worked at all? It probably didn't matter, and\nit could hardly be worse than whatever the risers had run into beyond\nthe hole in the present sky. Metaphysics was a subject with which he\nwasn't yet fully prepared to cope.\n\nThe model of the world inside the orrery must have been made from\nearthly materials already, and it was colored to depict land and sea\nareas. It could probably be used. At their agreement, he nodded with\nsome satisfaction. That should save some time, at least. He stared\ndoubtfully at the rods and bearings that supported the model world in\nthe center of the orrery.\n\n\"What about those things? How do we hold the globe in the center of\neverything?\"\n\nBork shrugged. \"It seems simple enough. We'll fashion supports of more\nof the sky material.\"\n\n\"And have real rods sticking up from the poles in the real universe?\"\nHanson asked sarcastically.\n\n\"Why not?\" Bork seemed surprised at Hanson's tone. \"There have always\nbeen such columns connecting the world and the sky. What else would keep\nus from falling?\"\n\nHanson swore. He might have guessed it! The only wonder was that simple\nrods were used instead of elephants and turtles. And the doubly-damned\nfools had let Menes drive millions of slaves to death to build a pyramid\nto the sky when there were already natural columns that could have been\nused!\n\n\"There remains only one step,\" Sather Karf decided after a moment more.\n\"To make symbol and thing congruent, all must be invoked with the true\nand secret name of the universe.\"\n\nHanson suddenly remembered legends of the tetragrammaton and the tales\nof magic he'd read in which there was always one element lacking. \"And I\nsuppose nobody knows that or dares to use it?\"\n\nThere was hurt pride of the aged face and the ring of vast authority in\nhis voice. \"Then you suppose wrong, Dave Hanson! Since this world first\ncame out of Duality, a Sather Karf has known that mystery! Make your\ndevice and I shall not fail in the invocation!\"\n\nFor the first time, Hanson discovered that the warlocks could work when\nthey had to, however much they disliked it. And at their own\nspecialties, they were superb technicians. Under the orders of Sather\nKarf, the camp sprang into frenzied but orderly activity.\n\nThey lost a few mandrakes in prying loose some of the sun material, and\nmore in getting a small sphere of it shaped. But the remainder gave them\nthe heat to melt the sky stuff. When it came to glass blowing, Hanson\nhad to admit they were experts; it should have come as no surprise,\nafter the elaborate alchemical apparatus he'd seen. Once the crystal\nshell was cracked out of the orrery, a fat-faced Ser came in with a long\ntube and began working the molten sky material, getting the feel of it.\nHe did things Hanson knew were nearly impossible, and he did them with\nthe calm assurance of an expert. Even when another rift in the sky\nappeared with a crackling of thunder, there was no faltering on his\npart. The sky shell and world supports were blown into shape around the\nworld model inside the outer tracks in one continuous operation. The Ser\nthen clipped the stuff from his tube and sealed the tiny opening\nsmoothly with a bit of sun material on the end of a long metal wand.\n\n\"Interesting material,\" he commented, as if only the technical nature of\nthe stuff had offered any problem to him.\n\nTiny, carefully polished chips from the stars were ready, and men began\nplacing them delicately on the shell. They sank into it at once and\nbegan twinkling. The planets had also been prepared, and they also went\ninto the shell, while a mate to each was attached to the tracking\nmechanism. The tiny sun came last. Hanson fretted as he saw it sink into\nthe shell, sure it would begin to melt the sky material. It seemed to\nhave no effect, however; apparently the sun was not supposed to melt the\nsky when it was in place--so the little sun didn't melt the shell. Once\nhe was sure of that, he used a scrap of the sky to insulate the second\nlittle sun that would control the first sympathetically from the track.\nHe moved the control delicately by hand, and the little sun followed\ndutifully.\n\nThe weights on the control mechanism were in place, Hanson noted.\nSomeone would probably have to keep them wound from now on, unless they\ncould devise a foolproof motor. But that was for the future. He bent to\nthe hand cranks. Sather Karf was being called to give the exact settings\nfor this moment, but Hanson had a rough idea of where the planets should\nbe. He began turning the crank, just as the Sather came up.\n\nThere was a slight movement. Then the crank stuck, and there was a\nwhirring of slipping gears! The fools who had moved the orrery must have\nbeen so careless that they'd sprung the mechanism. He bent down to study\nthe tiny little jeweled gears. A whole gear train was out of place!\n\nSather Karf was also inspecting it, and the words he cried didn't sound\nlike an invocation, though they were strange enough. He straightened,\nstill cursing. \"Fix it!\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" Hanson agreed doubtfully. \"But you'd better get the man who\nmade this. He'll know better than I--\"\n\n\"He was killed in the first cracking of the sky when a piece hit him.\nFix it, Dave Hanson. You claimed to be a repairman for such devices.\"\n\nHanson bent to study it again, using a diamond lens one of the warlocks\nhanded him. It was a useful device, having about a hundred times\nmagnification without the need for exact focusing. He stared at the\njumble of fine gears, then glanced out through the open front: of the\nbuilding toward the sky. There was even less of it showing than he had\nremembered. Most of the great dome was empty. And now there were\nsuggestions of ... shadows ... in the empty spots. He looked away\nhastily, shaken.\n\n\"I'll need some fine tools,\" he said.\n\n\"They were lost in moving this,\" Ser Perth told him. \"This is the best\nwe can do.\"\n\nThe jumble of tools had obviously been salvaged from the kits on the\ntractors in the camp. There was one fairly small pair of pliers, a small\npick and assorted useless junk. He shook his head hopelessly.\n\n\"Fix it!\" Sather Karf ordered again. The old man's eyes were also on the\nsky. \"You have ten minutes, perhaps--no more.\"\n\nHanson's fingers steadied as he found bits of wire and began improvising\ntools to manipulate the tiny gears. The mechanism was a piece of superb\ncraftsmanship that should have lasted for a million years, but it had\nnever been meant to withstand the heavy shock of being dropped, as it\nmust have been. And there was very little space inside. It should have\nbeen disassembled and put back piece by piece, but there was no time for\nthat.\n\nAnother thunder of falling sky sounded, and the ground heaved.\n\"Earthquakes!\" Sather Karf whispered. \"The end is near!\"\n\nThen a shout went up, and Hanson jerked his eyes from the gears to focus\non a group of rocs that were landing at the far end of the camp. Men\nwere springing from their backs before they stopped running--men in\ndull robes with elaborate masks over their faces. At the front was\nMalok, leader of the Sons of the Egg, brandishing his knife.\n\nHis voice carried clearly. \"The egg hatches! To the orrery and smash it!\nThat was the shadow in the pool. Destroy it before Dave Hanson can\ncomplete his magic!\"\n\nThe men behind him yelled. Around Hanson, the magicians cried out in\nshocked fear. Then old Sather Karf was dashing out from under the cover\nof the building, brandishing a pole on which a drop of the sun-stuff was\nglowing. His voice rose into a command that rang out over the cries of\nthe others.\n\nDave reached for a heavy hammer, meaning to follow. The old Sather\nseemed to sense it without looking back. \"Fix the engine, Dave Hanson,\"\nhe called.\n\nIt made sense. The others could do the fighting, but only he had\ntraining with such mechanisms. He turned back to his work, just as the\nwarlocks began rallying behind Sather Karf, grabbing up what weapons\nthey could find. There was no magic in this fight. Sticks, stones,\nhammers and knives were all that remained workable.\n\nDave Hanson bent over the gears, cursing. Now there was another rumble\nof thunder from the falling sky. The half-light from the reflected\nsunlight dimmed, and the ground shook violently. Another set of gears\nbroke from the housing. Hanson caught up a bit of sun-stuff on the sharp\npoint of the awl and brought it closer, until it burned his hands. But\nhe had seen enough. The mechanism was ruined beyond his chance to repair\nit in time.\n\nHe slapped the cover shut and stuck the sun-tipped awl where it would\nlight as much of the orrery as possible. As always, the skills of his\nown world had failed. To the blazes with it, then--when in magic land,\nmagic had to do.\n\nHe thought of calling Ser Perth or Sather Karf, but there was no time\nfor that, and they could hardly have heard him over the sounds of the\ndesperate fight going on.\n\nHe bent to the floor, searching until he found a ball of the sky\nmaterial that had been pinched off when the little opening was sealed.\nFurther hunting gave him a few bits of dust from the star bits and some\nof the junk that had gone into shaping the planets. He brushed in some\ndirt from the ground that had been touched by the sun stuff and was\nstill glowing faintly. He wasn't at all sure of how much he could\nextrapolate from what he'd read in the book on Applied Semantics, but he\nknew he needed a control--a symbol of the symbol, in this case. It was\ncrude, but it might serve to represent the orrery.\n\nHe clutched it in his hand and touched it against the orrery, trying to\nremember the formula for the giving of a true name. He had to improvise,\nbut he got through a rough version of it, until he came to the end: \"I\nwho created you name you--\" What the deuce did he name it? \"I name you\nRumpelstilsken and order you to obey me when I call you by your name.\"\n\nHe clutched the blob of material tighter in his hand, mentally trying to\nshape an order that wouldn't backfire, as such orders seemed to in the\nchildhood stories of magic he had learned. Finally his lips whispered\nthe simplest order he could find. \"Rumpelstilsken, repair yourself!\"\n\nThere was a whirring and scraping inside the mechanism, and Hanson let\nout a yell. He got only a hasty glimpse of gears that seemed to be back\non their tracks before Sather Karf was beside him, driving the cranks\nwith desperate speed.\n\n\"We have less than a minute!\" the old voice gasped.\n\nThe Sather's fingers spun on the controls. Then he straightened, moving\nhis hands toward the orrery in passes too rapid to be seen. There was a\nstring of obvious ritual commands in their sacred language. Then a\nsingle word rang out, a string of sounds that should have come from no\nhuman vocal chords.\n\nThere was a wrench and twist through every atom of Hanson's body. The\nuniverse seemed to cry out. Over the horizon, a great burning disc rose\nand leaped toward the heavens as the sun went back to its place in the\nsky. The big bits of sky-stuff around also jerked upwards, revealing\nthemselves by the wind they whipped up and by the holes they ripped\nthrough the roof of the building. Hanson clutched at the scrap he had\npocketed, but it showed no sign of leaving, and the tiny blob of\nsun-stuff remained fixed to the awl.\n\nThrough the diamond lens, Hanson could see the model of the world in the\norrery changing. There were clouds apparently painted on it where no\nclouds had been. And there was an indication of movement in the green of\nthe forests and the blue of the oceans, as if trees were whipping in the\nwind and waves lapping the shores.\n\nWhen he jerked his eyes upward, all seemed serene in the sky. Sunlight\nshone normally on the world, and from under the roof he could see the\ngaudy blue of sky, complete, with the cracks in it smoothing out as he\nwatched.\n\nThe battle outside had stopped with the rising of the sun. Half the\nwarlocks were lying motionless, and the other half had clustered\ntogether, close to the building where Hanson and Sather Karf stood. The\nSons of the Egg seemed to have suffered less, since they greatly\nout-numbered the others, but they were obviously more shocked by the\nrising of the sun and the healing of the sky.\n\nThen Malok's voice rang out sharply. \"It isn't stable yet! Destroy the\nmachine! The egg must hatch!\"\n\nHe leaped forward, brandishing his knife, while the Sons of the Egg fell\nin behind him. The warlocks began to close ranks, falling back to make a\nstand under the jutting edge of the roof, where they could protect the\norrery. Bork and Ser Perth were among them, bloody but hopelessly\ndetermined.\n\nOne look at Sather Karf's expression was enough to convince Hanson that\nMalok had cried the truth and that their work could still be undone. And\nit was obvious that the warlocks could never stand the charge of the\nSons. Too many of them had already been killed, and there was no time\nfor reviving them.\n\nSather Karf was starting forward into the battle, but Hanson made no\nmove to follow. He snapped the diamond lens to his eye and his fingers\ncaught at the drop of sun-stuff on the awl. He had to hold it near the\nglowing bit for steadiness, and it began searing his fingers. He forced\ncontrol on his muscles and plunged his hand slowly through the sky\nsphere, easing the glowing blob downward toward the spot on the globe he\nhad already located with the lens. His thumb and finger moved downward\ndelicately, with all the skill of practice at working with nearly\ninvisibly fine wires on delicate instruments.\n\nThen he jerked his eyes away from the model and looked out. Something\nglaring and hot was suspended in the air five miles away. He moved his\nhand carefully, steadying it on one of the planet tracks. The glowing\nfire in the air outside moved another mile closer--then another. And\nnow, around it, he could see a monstrous fingertip and something that\nmight have been miles of thumbnail.\n\nThe warlocks leaped back under the roof. The Sons of the Egg screamed\nand panicked. Jerking horribly, the monstrous thing moved again. For\npart of a second, it hovered over the empty camp. Then it was gone.\n\nHanson began pulling his hand out through the shell of the model,\nwhimpering as his other hand clenched against the blob in his pocket. He\nhad suddenly realized what horrors were possible to anyone who could use\nthe orrery now. \"Rumpelstilsken, I command you to let no hand other than\nmine enter and to respond to no other controls.\" He hoped it would offer\nenough protection.\n\nHis hand came free and he threw the sun-bit away with a flick of his\nwrist. His hand ached with the impossible task of steadiness he had set\nit, and his finger and thumb burned and smoked. But the wound was\nalready healing.\n\nIn the exposed section of the camp, the Sons of the Egg were charred\ncorpses. There was a fire starting on the roof of the building, but\nothers had already run out to quench that. It sounded like the snuffling\nprogress of an undine across the roof! Maybe magic was working again.\n\nBork turned back from the sight of his former companions. His face was\nsick, but he managed to grin at Hanson. \"Dave Hanson, to whom nothing is\nimpossible,\" he said.\n\nHanson had located Nema finally as she approached. He caught her hand\nand grabbed Bork's arm. Like his own, it was trembling with fatigue and\nreaction.\n\n\"Come on,\" he said. \"Let's find some place where we can see whether it's\nimpossible now for you to magic up a decent meal. And a drink strong\nenough to scare away the sylphs.\"\n\nThe sylph that found them wasn't scared by the Scotch, but there was\nenough for all of them.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nThree days can work magic--in a world where magic works. The planets\nswung along their paths again and the sun was in the most favorable\nhouse for conjuration. The universe was stable again.\n\nThere was food for all, and houses had been conjured hastily to shelter\nthe people. The plagues were gone. Now the strange commerce and industry\nof this world were humming again. Those who had survived and those who\ncould be revived were busily rebuilding. Some were missing, of course.\nThose who had risen and--hatched--were beyond recall, but no one spoke\nof them. If any Sons of the Egg survived, they were quiet in their\ndefeat.\n\nHanson had been busy during most of the time. It had been taken for\ngranted that he would tend to the orrery, setting it for the most\nfavorable conditions when some special major work of magic required it,\nand he had taken the orders and moved the controls as they wanted them.\nThe orrery was housed temporarily in the reconstituted hall of the\nSatheri in the capital city. They were building a new hall for it, to be\nconstructed only of natural materials and hand labor, but that was a\nproject that would take long months still.\n\nNow the immediate pressure was gone, and Hanson was relaxing with Bork\nand Nema.\n\n\"Another week,\" Bork was saying. \"Maybe less. And then gangs of the\nwarlocks can spread out to fix up all the rest of the world--and to take\nover control of their slaves again. Are you happy with your victory,\nDave Hanson?\"\n\nHanson shrugged. He wasn't entirely sure, now. There was something in\nthe looks of the Sather who gave him orders for new settings that\nbothered him. And some of the developments he watched were hardly what\nhe would have preferred. The warlocks had good memories, it seemed, and\nthere had been manifold offenses against them while the world was\nfalling apart.\n\nHe tried to put it out of his mind as he drew Nema to him. She snuggled\nagainst him, admiring him with her eyes. But old habits were hard to\nbreak. \"Don't, Dave. I'm a registered and certified--\"\n\nShe stopped then, blushing, and Bork chuckled.\n\nSer Perth appeared at the doorway with two of the mandrakes. He motioned\nto Hanson. \"The council of Satheri want you,\" he said. His eyes avoided\nthe other, and he seemed uncomfortable.\n\n\"Why?\" Bork asked.\n\n\"It's time for Dave Hanson's reward,\" Ser Perth said. The words were\nsmooth enough, but the eyes turned away again.\n\nHanson got up and moved forward. He had been wondering when they would\nget around to this. Beside him, Bork and Nema also rose. \"Never trust a\nSather,\" Bork said softly.\n\nNema started to protest, then changed her mind. She frowned, torn\nbetween old and new loyalties.\n\n\"The summons was only for Dave Hanson,\" Ser Perth said sternly as the\nthree drew up to him. But as Hanson took the arms of the other two, the\nSer shrugged and fell in behind. Very softly, too low for the hearing of\nthe mandrakes, his words sounded in Hanson's ear. \"Guard yourself, Dave\nHanson!\"\n\nSo there was to be treachery, Hanson thought. He wasn't surprised. He\nwas probably lucky to have even three friends. The Satheri would hardly\nfeel very grateful to a mandrake-man who had accomplished something\nbeyond their power, now that the crisis was over. They had always been a\nhigh-handed bunch, apparently, and he had served his purpose. But he\ncovered his thoughts in a neutral expression and went forward quietly\ntoward the huge council room.\n\nThe seventy leading Satheri were all present, with Sather Karf\npresiding, when Hanson was ushered into their presence. He moved down\nthe aisle, not glancing at the seated Satheri, until he was facing the\nold man, drawing Nema and Bork with him. There were murmurs of protest,\nbut nobody stopped him. Above him, the eyes of Sather Karf were\nuncertain. For a moment, there seemed to be a touch of friendliness and\nrespect in them, but there was something else that Hanson liked far\nless. Any warmth that was there vanished at his first words.\n\n\"It's about time,\" Hanson said flatly. \"When you wanted your world\nsaved, you were free enough with offers of reward. But three days have\npassed without mention of it. Sather Karf, I demand your secret name!\"\n\nHe heard Nema gasp, but felt Bork's fingers press against his arm\nreassuringly. There was a rising mutter of shock and anger from the\nothers, but he lifted his voice over it. \"And the secret names of all\nthose present. That was also part of the promised reward.\"\n\n\"And do you think you could use the names, Dave Hanson?\" Sather Karf\nasked. \"Against the weight of all our knowledge, do you think you could\nbecome our master that easily?\"\n\nHanson had his own doubts. There were counter-magical methods against\nnearly all magic, and the book he had read had been only an elementary\none. But he nodded. \"I think with your name I could get my hands on your\nhearts, even if you did your worst. It doesn't matter. I claim my\nreward.\"\n\n\"And you shall have it. The word of Sather Karf is good,\" the old man\ntold him. \"But there was no mention of when you would be given those\nnames. You said that when the computer was finished you would _wait_ for\nmy true name, and I promised that you should have it when the time came,\nbut not what the time would be. So you will wait, or the agreement shall\nbe broken by you, not by me. When you are dying or otherwise beyond\npower over us, you shall have the names, Dave Hanson. No, hear me!\"\n\nHe lifted his hand in a brief gesture and Hanson felt a thickness over\nhis lips that made speech impossible.\n\n\"We have discussed your reward, and you shall indeed have it,\" Sather\nKarf went on. \"Exactly as I promised it to you. I agreed to find ways to\nreturn you to your own world intact, and you shall be returned.\"\n\nFor a moment, the thickness seemed to relax, and Hanson choked a few\nwords out through it. \"What's the world of a mandrake-man, Sather Karf?\nA mandrake swamp?\"\n\n\"For a mandrake-man, yes. But not for you.\" There was something like\namusement in the old man's voice. \"I never said you were a mandrake-man.\nThat was told you by Ser Perth who knew no better. No, Dave Hanson, you\nwere too important to us for that. Mandrake-men are always less than\ntrue men, and we needed your best. You were conjured atom by atom, id\nand ka and soul, from your world. Even the soul may be brought over\nwhen enough masters of magic work together and you were our greatest\nconjuration. Even then, we almost failed. But you're no mandrake-man.\"\n\nA load of sickness seemed to leave Hanson's mind. He had never fully\nrealized how much the shame of what he thought himself to be had weighed\non him. Then his mind adjusted to the new facts, dismissing his past\nworries.\n\n\"I promised you that we would fill your entire lifetime with pleasures,\"\nSather Karf went on. \"And you were assured of jewels to buy an empire.\nAll this the council is prepared to give you. Are you ready for your\nreward?\"\n\n\"No!\" Bork's cry broke out before Hanson could answer. The big man was\nwrithing before he could finish the word, but his own fingers were\nworking in conjurations that seemed to hold back enough of the spells\nagainst him to let him speak. \"Dave Hanson, your world was a world of\nrigid laws. You died there. And there would be no magic to avoid the\nfact that there you must always be dead.\"\n\nHanson's eyes riveted on the face of Sather Karf. The old man looked\nback and finally nodded his head. \"That is true,\" he admitted. \"It would\nhave been kinder for you not to know, but it is the truth.\"\n\n\"And jewels enough to buy an empire on a corpse,\" Hanson accused. \"A\nlifetime of pleasures--simple enough when that lifetime would be over\nbefore it began. What were the pleasures, Sather Karf? Having you reveal\nyour name just before I was sent back and feeling I'd won?\" He grimaced.\n\"I reject the empty rewards of your empty promises!\"\n\n\"I also rejected the interpretation, but I was out-voted,\" Sather Karf\nsaid, and there was a curious reluctance as he raised his hand. \"But it\nis too late. Dave Hanson prepare to receive your reward. By the power of\nyour name--\"\n\nHanson's hand went to his pocket and squeezed down on the blob of sky\nmaterial there. He opened his mouth, and found that the thickness was\nback. For a split second, his mind screamed in panic as he realized he\ncould not even pronounce the needed words.\n\nThen coldness settled over his thoughts as he drove them to shape the\nunvoiced words in his mind. Nobody had told him that magic incantations\nhad to be pronounced aloud. It seemed to be the general law, but for all\nhe knew, ignorance of the law here might change the law. At least he\nmeant to die trying, if he failed.\n\n\"Rumpelstilsken, I command the sun to set!\"\n\nHe seemed to sense a hesitation in his mind, and then the impression of\njeweled gears turning. Outside the window, the light reddened, dimmed,\nand was gone, leaving the big room illuminated by only a few witch\nlights.\n\nThe words Sather Karf had been intoning came to a sudden stop, even\nbefore they could be drowned in the shouts of shock and panic from the\nothers. His eyes centered questioningly on Hanson and the flicker of a\nsmile crossed his face. \"To the orrery!\" he ordered. \"Use the manual\ncontrols.\"\n\nHanson waited until he estimated the men who left would be at the\ncontrols. The he clutched the sky-blob again. The thoughts in his mind\nwere clearer this time.\n\n\"Rumpelstilsken, let the sun rise from the west and set in the east!\"\n\nSome of the Satheri were at the windows to watch what happened this\ntime. Their shouts were more frightened than before. A minute later, the\nothers were back, screaming out the news that the manual controls could\nnot be moved--could not even be touched.\n\nThe orrery named Rumpelstilsken was obeying its orders fully, and the\nuniverse was obeying its symbol.\n\nSomehow, old Sather Karf brought order out of the frightened mob that\nhad been the greatest Satheri in the world. \"All right, Dave Hanson,\" he\nsaid calmly. \"Return the sun to its course. We agree to your\nconditions.\"\n\n\"You haven't heard them yet!\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" Sather Karf answered firmly, \"we agree. What else can we\ndo? If you decided to wreck the sky again, even you might not be able to\nrepair it a second time.\" He tapped his hands lightly together and the\nsound of a huge gong reverberated in the room. \"Let the hall be cleared.\nI will accept the conditions in private.\"\n\nThere were no objections. A minute later Hanson, Bork and Nema were\nalone with the old man. Sunlight streamed in through the window, and\nthere were fleecy clouds showing in the blue sky.\n\n\"Well?\" Sather Karf asked. There was a trace of a smile on his face and\na glow of what seemed to be amusement in his eyes as he listened, though\nHanson could see nothing amusing in the suggestions he was making.\n\nFirst, of course, he meant to stay here. There was no other place for\nhim, but he would have chosen to stay in any event. Here he had\ndeveloped into what he had never even thought of being, and there were\nstill things to be learned. He'd gone a long way on what he'd found in\none elementary book. Now, with a chance to study all their magical lore\nand apply it with the methods he had learned in his own world, there\nwere amazing possibilities opening up to him. For the world, a few\nchanges would be needed. Magic should be limited to what magic did best;\nthe people needed to grow their own food and care for themselves. And\nthey needed protection from the magicians. There would have to be a code\nof ethics to be worked out later.\n\n\"You've got all the time you need to work things out, Sathator Hanson,\"\nSather Karf told him. \"It's your world, literally, so take your time.\nWhat do you want first?\"\n\nHanson considered it, while Nema's hand crept into his. Then he grinned.\n\"I guess I want to get your great granddaughter turned into a registered\nand certified wife and take her on a long honeymoon,\" he decided. \"After\nwhat you've put me through, I need a rest.\"\n\nHe took her arm and started down the aisle of the council room. Behind\nhim, he heard Bork's chuckle and the soft laughter of Sather Karf. But\ntheir faces were sobering by the time he reached the doorway and looked\nback.\n\n\"I like him, too, grandfather,\" Bork was saying. \"Well, it seems your\ngroup was right, after all. Your prophecy is fulfilled. He may have a\nlittle trouble with so many knowing his name, but he's Dave Hanson, to\nwhom nothing is impossible. You should have considered all the\nimplications of omnipotence.\"\n\nSather Karf nodded. \"Perhaps. And perhaps your group was also right,\nBork. It seems that the world-egg has hatched.\" His eyes lifted and\ncentered on the doorway.\n\nHanson puzzled over their words briefly as he closed the door and went\nout with Nema. He'd probably have to do something about his name, but\nthe rest of the conversation was a mystery to him. Then he dismissed\nit. He could always remember it when he had more time to think about it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was many millenia and several universes later when Dave Hanson\nfinally remembered. By then it was no mystery, of course. And there was\nno one who dared pronounce his true name.\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n       ACE SCIENCE FICTION DOUBLES\n\n       Two books back-to-back\n\n       Just 95c each\n\n 009902 =Against Arcturus= Putney\n        =Time Thieves= Koontz\n\n 066126 =Blackman's Burden= Reynolds\n        =Border, Steed Nor Birth= Reynolds\n\n 102939 =The Chariots of Ra= Bulmer\n        =Earth Strings= Rackham\n\n 114512 =In the Alternate Universe= Chandler\n        =Into the Coils of Time= Chandler\n\n 775254 =Son of the Tree= Vance\n        =House of Iszm= Vance\n\n 156976 =The Unteleported Man= Dick\n        =Dr. Futurity= Dick\n\n 158907 =Door Through Space= Bradley\n        =Rendezvous on a Lost World= Chandler\n\n 166405 =Dragon Master=\n        =Five Gold Bands= Vance\n\n 317552 =The Hard Way Up= Chandler\n        =Veiled World= Lory\n\n 337105 =Highwood= Barrett\n        =Annihilation Factor= Bayley\n\n 370627 =The Inheritors= Chandler\n        =The Gateway to Never= Chandler\n\n 665257 =Pirates of Zan= Leinster\n        =Mutant Weapon= Leinster\n\n 799759 =Technos=\n        =A Scatter of Sardust= Tubb\n\n Available wherever paperbacks are sold or use this coupon.\n\n\n     =ace books=, (Dept.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
