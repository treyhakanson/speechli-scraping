But maybe we take too much on faith.\n    This first crossing for instance. Were you there? Did you see\n    Columbus land? Here's the story of a man who can give us the\n    straight facts._\n\n\nThe laughter brought spots of color to his cheeks. He stood there for a\nwhile, taking it, and then decided he had had enough and would sit down.\nA whisper of amusement still stirred the room as he returned to his seat\nand the professor said,\n\n\"But just a moment, Mr. Jones. Won't you tell the class what makes you\nthink Columbus was not the 'bold skipper' the history books say he was.\nAfter all, Mr. Jones, this is a history class. If you know more or\nbetter history than the history books do, isn't it your duty to tell\nus?\"\n\n[Illustration: He clutched at his slashed veins and snarled into the\nface of death.]\n\n\"I didn't say he _wasn't_,\" Danny Jones said desperately as the laughter\nstarted again. Some profs were like that, he thought. Picking on one\nstudent and making the rest of the class laugh and think what a great\nguy the prof was and what a prize dodo the hapless student was. \"I\nsaid,\" Danny went on doggedly, \"Columbus might not have been--maybe\nwasn't--the bold skipper the history books claim he was. I can't prove\nit. No one can. I haven't a time machine.\"\n\nAgain it was the wrong thing to say. The professor wagged a finger in\nfront of his face and gave Danny a sly look. \"Don't you,\" he said,\n\"don't you indeed? I was beginning to think you had been willed H. G.\nWells' famous literary invention, young man.\" That one had the class all\nbut rolling in the aisles.\n\nDanny said desperately, \"No! No, I mean, they don't even know for sure\nif Columbus was born in Genoa. They just think he was. So they also\ncould be wrong about--\"\n\nAbruptly the professor's face went serious. \"My dear Mr. Jones,\" he said\nslowly, acidly, \"don't you think we've had enough of fantasy? Don't you\nthink we ought to return to history?\"\n\nDanny sat down and for a moment shut his eyes but remained conscious of\neveryone looking at him, staring at him, evaluating. It wasn't so easy,\nhe decided, being a sophomore transfer student from a big city college,\nwhere almost everything went and there was a certain amount of anonymity\nin the very size of the classes, to a small town college where every\nface, after a week or so, was familiar. Danny wished he had kept his big\nyap shut about Columbus, but it was too late now. They'd be ribbing him\nfor weeks....\n\nOn his way back to the dorm after classes he was hailed by a student who\nlived down the hall from him, a fellow named Groves, who said, \"How's\nthe boy, Danny. Next thing you'll tell us is that Cortez was really a\nsexy Spanish broad with a thirty-eight bust who conquered Montezuma and\nhis Indians with sex appeal. Get it, boy. I said--\"\n\n\"Aw, lay off,\" Danny grumbled.\n\nThe other boy laughed, then shrugged, then said, \"Oh yeah, forgot to\ntell you. There's a telegram waiting for you in the dorm. House-mother's\ngot it. Well, see you, Vasco da Gama.\"\n\nDanny trudged on to the Georgian-style dormitory and went inside,\nthrough the lobby and behind the stairs to the house-mother's office at\nthe rear of the building. She was a kindly-looking old woman with a halo\nof white hair and a smile which made her a good copy of everyone's\ngrandmother. But now her face was set in unexpectedly grim lines.\n\"Telegram for you, Danny,\" she said slowly. \"They read it over the\ntelephone first, then delivered it.\" She held out a yellow envelope.\n\"I'm afraid it's some bad news, Danny.\" She seemed somehow reluctant to\npart with the little yellow envelope.\n\n\"What is it?\" Danny said.\n\n\"You'd better read it yourself. Here, sit down.\"\n\nDanny nodded, took the envelope, sat down and opened it. He read, MR.\nDANNY JONES, WHITNEY COLLEGE, WHITNEY, VIRGINIA. REGRET TO INFORM YOU\nUNCLE AVERILL PASSED AWAY LAST NIGHT PEACEFULLY IN HIS SLEEP LEAVING\nUNSPECIFIED PROPERTY TO YOU. It was signed with a name Danny did not\nrecognize.\n\n\"I'm terribly sorry,\" the house-mother said, placing her hand on\nDanny's shoulder.\n\n\"Oh, that's all right, Mrs. Grange. It's all right. You see, Uncle\nAverill wasn't a young man. He must have been in his eighties.\"\n\n\"Were you very close to him, Danny?\"\n\n\"No, not for a long time. When I was a kid--\"\n\nMrs. Grange smiled.\n\n\"Well, when I was eight or nine, I used to see him all the time. We\nstayed at his place on the coast near St. Augustine, Florida, for a\nyear. I--I feel sorry about Uncle Averill, Mrs. Grange, but I feel\nbetter about something that happened in class today. I--I think Uncle\nAverill would have approved of how I acted.\"\n\n\"Want to talk about it?\"\n\n\"Well, it's just he always said never to take any so-called fact for\ngranted, especially in history. I can almost remember his voice now, the\nway he used to say, 'if ever there's an argument in history, sonny, all\nyou ever get is the propaganda report of the side which won.' You know,\nMrs. Grange, I think he was right. Of course, a lot of folks thought old\nUncle Averill was a little queer. Touched in the head is what they\nsaid.\"\n\n\"They oughtn't to say such things.\"\n\n\"Always tinkering around in his basement. Funny, nobody ever knew on\nwhat. He wouldn't let anybody near the place. He had a time lock and\neverything. What nobody could figure out is if he was trying so hard to\nguard something that was in the basement, why did he sometimes disappear\nfor weeks on end without even telling anybody where he went. And I\nremember,\" Danny went on musing, \"every time he came back he went into\nthat harangue about history, as if somehow he had confirmed his\nsuspicions. He was a funny old guy but I liked him.\"\n\n\"You remembering him so vividly after all these years will be the best\nepitaph your uncle could have, Danny. But what are you going to do?\nAbout what he left you, I mean.\"\n\n\"Uncle Averill always liked promptness. If he left something for me,\nhe'd want me to pick it up immediately. I guess I ought to go down there\nto St. Augustine as fast as I can.\"\n\n\"But your classes--\"\n\n\"I'll have to take an emergency leave of absence.\"\n\n\"Under the circumstances, I'm sure the college will approve. Do you\nthink your uncle left you anything--well--important?\"\n\n\"Important?\" Danny repeated the word. \"No, I don't think so. Not by the\nworld's standards. But it must have been important to Uncle Averill. He\nwas a--you know, an image-breaker--\"\n\n\"An iconoclast,\" supplied Mrs. Grange.\n\n\"Yes'm, an iconoclast. But I liked him.\"\n\nMrs. Grange nodded. \"You'd better get over and see the Dean.\"\n\nAn hour later, Danny was at the bus depot, waiting for the Greyhound\nthat would take him over to Richmond, where he would meet a train for\nthe south and Florida.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a rambling white stucco house with a red tile roof and a pleasant\ngrove of palm trees in front and flame-red hibiscus climbing the stucco.\nThe lawyer, whose name was Tartalion, met him at the door.\n\n\"I'll get right down to business, Mr. Jones,\" Tartalion said after they\nhad entered the house. \"Your uncle wanted it that way.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Danny said, \"don't tell me they already had the\nfuneral?\"\n\n\"Your uncle didn't believe in funerals. His will stipulated cremation.\"\n\n\"But, it was so--\"\n\n\"Sudden? I know, the will wasn't officially probated. But your uncle had\na judge for a friend, and under the circumstances, his wishes were\ngranted. Now, then, you know why you're here?\"\n\n\"You mean, what he left me? I thought I'd at least get to see his--\"\n\n\"His body? Not your uncle, not old Averill Jones. You ought to know\nbetter. Sonny,\" the lawyer asked abruptly, \"how well did you know the\nold man?\"\n\nThe sonny rankled. After all, Danny thought, I'm nineteen. I like beer\nand girls and I'm no sonny anymore. He sighed and thought of his history\nclass, then thought of Uncle Averill's opinion of history, and felt\nbetter. He explained the relationship to Mr. Tartalion and waited for\nthe lawyer to speak.\n\n\"Well, it beats me,\" Tartalion admitted. \"Why he left it to a nephew he\nhasn't seen in ten or eleven years, I mean. Don't just look at me like\nthat. You know that contraption he had in the basement, don't you? How\nhe wouldn't let a soul near it, ever? Then tell me something, Danny. Why\ndid he leave it to you?\"\n\n\"You're joking!\" Danny cried.\n\n\"I was your uncle's lawyer. I wouldn't joke about it. He said it was the\nonly thing he had worth willing. He said he willed it to you. Want me to\nread you the clause?\"\n\nDanny nodded. He felt strangely flattered, because the contraption in\nAverill Jones' basement--a contraption which no one but Averill Jones\nhad ever seen--had been the dearest thing in the old bachelor's life.\nActually, he was not Danny's uncle, but his grand-uncle. He had lived\nalone in St. Augustine and had liked living alone. The only relative he\nhad tolerated was Danny, when Danny was a small boy. Then, as Danny\napproached his ninth birthday, the old man had said, \"They're teaching\nyou too much at school, son. Too many wrong things, too many\nhighfalutin' notions, too much just plain old hogwash. Why don't you\nkind of make yourself scarce for a few years?\" It had been blunt and to\nthe point. It had made Danny cry. He hadn't thought of what had happened\nthat last day he'd seen his grand-uncle for years, but he thought of it\nnow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But why can't I come back and see you?\" he had asked tearfully.\n\n\"On account of the machine, son.\"\n\n\"But _why_, uncle?\"\n\n\"Hey, come on now and stop your blubbering all over me. If you can't you\ncan't.\"\n\n\"You have to tell me why!\"\n\n\"Stubborn little critter. Well, I like that. All right, I'll tell you\nwhy. Because the machine has a funny kind of fuel, that's why. It\ndoesn't run on gasoline, Danny, or anything like that.\"\n\n\"What does it do, uncle?\"\n\nBut the old man had shaken his head. \"Maybe someday after I'm gone\nyou'll find out. If anyone finds out, it will be you, and that's a\npromise.\"\n\n\"You still didn't tell me why I have to go away.\"\n\n\"Because--well, don't go telling this to your folks, son, or they'll\nthink old Uncle Averill has a screw loose somewheres--because that\nmachine I have downstairs runs on faith. On faith, you understand? Oh,\nnot the kind of faith they think is important and do a lot of talking\nand sermoning about, but a different kind of faith. Personal faith, you\nmight say. Faith in a dream or a belief, no matter what people think.\nAnd--you know what ruins that faith?\"\n\n\"No,\" Danny had said, his eyes very big.\n\n\"Knowledge!\" cried his uncle. \"Too much so-called knowledge which isn't\nknowledge at all, but hearsay. That's what they're teaching you. In\nschool, other places, every day of your life. I'll tell you when you can\ncome back, Danny: when you're ready to throw most of it overboard. All\nright?\"\n\nHe had had to say all right. It was the last time he had ever seen his\nuncle, but those weren't the last words Averill Jones had spoken to him,\nfor the old man had added as he got up to go: \"Don't forget, son. Don't\nlet them pull the wool over your eyes. History is propaganda--from a\nwinner's point of view. If a side lost the war and got stamped on, you\nnever see the war from its point of view. If an idea got out of favor\nand stamped on, the idea is ridiculed. Don't forget it, son. If you\nbelieve something, if you _know_ it's right, have faith in it and don't\ngive a mind what people say. Promise?\"\n\nDanny, his eyes stinging with tears because somehow he could sense he\nwould never see Uncle Averill again, had said that he promised.\n\n\"... to my nephew, Danny Jones,\" the lawyer was reading. \"So, you see,\nyou'll have to go right down there and look the thing over. Naturally,\nI'll have to leave the house while you do so and I won't be able to\nreturn until you tell me I can--\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Weren't you listening?\"\n\n\"I guess I was thinking about my uncle.\"\n\n\"Well, the clause says you're to examine the machine alone, with no one\nelse in the house. It's perfectly legal. If that's what your uncle\nwanted, that's what he'll get. Are you all set?\"\n\nDanny nodded and Tartalion shook his hand solemnly, then left the room.\nDanny heard the lawyer's footsteps receding, heard the front door open\nand close, heard a car engine start. Then, slowly, he walked through the\nliving room of his dead uncle's house and across the long, narrow\nkitchen and to the basement stairs. His hands were very dry and he felt\nhis heart thudding. He was nervous, which surprised him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut why? he thought, why should it surprise me? All my life, Uncle\nAverill's basement has been a mystery. Let's face it, Danny-boy, you\nhaven't exactly had an adventurous life. Maybe Uncle Averill was the\nbiggest adventure in it, with his secret machine and strange\ndisappearances. And maybe Uncle Averill did a good selling job when you\nwere small, because that machine means mystery to you. It's probably not\nmuch more than a better mousetrap, but you want to believe it is, don't\nyou? And you're nervous because the way Uncle Averill kept you and\nanyone else away from his basement when you were a kid makes it a kind\nof frightening place, even now.\n\nHe opened the basement door with a key which the lawyer had given him.\nBeyond the door were five steps and another door--this one of metal. It\nhad had a time lock in the old days, Danny remembered, but the lock was\ngone now. The metal door swung ponderously, like the door to a bank\nvault, and then Danny was on the other side. It was dark down there, but\nfaint light seeped in through small high windows and in a few moments\nDanny's eyes grew accustomed to the gloom.\n\nThe basement was empty except for what looked like a big old steamer\ntrunk in the center of the dusty cement floor.\n\nDanny was disappointed. He had childhood visions of an intricate maze\nof machinery cluttering up every available square foot of basement\nspace, but now he knew that whatever it was which had taken up so much\nof Uncle Averill's time could fit in the odd-looking steamer trunk in\nthe center of the floor and thus wasn't too much bigger than a good-size\nTV set. He walked slowly to the trunk and stood for a few moments over\nthe lid. It was an ancient-looking steamer: Uncle Averill must have\nowned it since his own youth. Still, just a plain trunk.\n\nDanny was in no hurry to open the lid, which did not seem to be locked.\nFor a few moments, at least, he could shield himself from further\ndisappointment--because now he had a hunch that Uncle Averill's machine\nwas going to be a first-class dud. Maybe, he thought gloomily, Uncle\nAverill had simply not liked to be with people and had used the ruse of\na bank-vault door and an empty steamer trunk to achieve privacy whenever\nhe felt the need for it.\n\nRemembering the history class, Danny decided that--after all--sometimes\nthat wasn't a bad idea. Finally, he called himself a fool for waiting\nand threw up the trunk-lid.\n\nA small case was all he saw inside, although the interior of the trunk\nwas larger than he had expected. A man could probably curl up in there\nquite comfortably. But the case--the case looked exactly like it ought\nto house a tape-recorder.\n\nDanny reached in and hauled out the case. It was heavy, about as heavy\nas a tape-recorder ought to be. Danny placed it down on the floor and\nopened it.\n\nWhat he saw was a battery-powered tape-recorder. His disappointment\nincreased: Uncle Averill had left a message for him, that was all.\nDutifully, however, he set the spools and snapped on the switch.\n\nA voice from yesterday--Uncle Averill's voice--spoke to him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Hallo, Danny,\" it said. \"The way the years roll by, I forget exactly\nhow old you are, boy. Seventeen? Eighteen? Twenty? Well, it doesn't\nmatter--if you still believe. If you have faith. Faith in what? Maybe\nnow you're old enough to know. I mean faith in--not having faith. That\nis, faith in not taking faithfully all the silly items of knowledge\nthey try to cram down your throat in school. See what I mean? Remember\nwhat I always said about history, Danny: you get propaganda, is all,\nfrom the winning side. If you got faith enough in yourself, Danny, faith\nenough not to believe everything the history books tell you, that's the\nkind of faith I mean. Because such a faith gave me the most interesting\nlife a man ever lived, make no mistake about that.\n\n\"I'm dead, Danny. Yep, old Uncle Averill is dead. Because this\ntape-recorder won't be left you in my will until I am dead. But, no\nregrets, boy. I had a great life. How great--nobody knows. Only you,\nyou're about to find out. Do you believe? Do you believe the way I have\nin mind? Make no mistake about it now, son. If you don't believe, you\nmight as well burn these spools and go home.\"\n\nDanny considered. He remembered what had happened in his history class.\nWasn't that the sort of faith Uncle Averill had in mind? Faith not to\nbelieve in historical fairy tales? Faith to doubt when one ought to\ndoubt? Faith to be skeptical....\n\n\"Good,\" said the voice from the past. \"Then you're still here. Look in\nfront of you, Danny-boy. The trunk. The old steamer. Know what it is?\"\n\n\"No,\" Danny said, then clamped a hand over his mouth. For a moment he\nhad actually believed he was talking to the dead man.\n\n\"It's a time machine,\" said his Uncle's voice.\n\nThere was a silence. The tape went on winding. For a moment, Danny\nthought that was all. Then the voice continued: \"No, your old\ngrand-uncle isn't nuts, Danny. It's a time machine. I know it's a time\nmachine because I used it all my life. You expected some kind of\ncomplicated gadget down here, I know. I made everybody think it was a\ngadget. Going down to your basement and tinkering with a gadget is fine\nin our culture. Hell's fire, boy, it's approved behavior. But locking a\nbank-vault door behind you and curling up in a steamer trunk, that isn't\napproved. Now, is it?\n\n\"I'll tell you about this here time machine, sonny. It isn't a machine\nat all, in the strict sense of the word. You can see that. It's\njust--well, an empty box. But it works, and what else ought a fellow to\ncare about.\n\n\"Funny how I got it. I was eighteen or twenty, maybe. And my\nGrand-uncle Daniel gave it to me. Daniel, get me. Daniel to Averill to\nDaniel. So when you have a grand-nephew, see that his name's Averill,\nunderstand? Keep it going, Danny. Because this trunk is old. A lot older\nthan you think.\n\n\"And you can travel through time in it. Don't look at me like that, I\nknow what you're thinking. There isn't any such thing as time travel. In\nthe strict sense of the word, it's impossible. You can't resurrect the\npast or peek into the unborn future. Well, I don't know about the\nfuture, but I do know about the past. But you got to have faith, you got\nto be a kid at heart, Danny. You got to have this dream, see?\n\n\"Because you don't travel anywhere. But your mind does, and it's like\nyou wake up in somebody else's body, drawn to him like a magnet,\nsomebody else--some_when_ else. Your body stays right here, you see. In\nthe trunk. In what they called suspended animation. But you--the real\nyou, the you that knows how to dream and to believe--you go back.\n\n\"Don't make the mistake I made at first. It's no dream in the usual\nsense of the word. It's real, Danny. You're somebody else back there,\nall right, but if he gets hurt, you get hurt. If he dies--taps for Danny\nJones! You get me?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dead man's voice chuckled. \"But don't think this means automatically\nyou'll be able to travel through time. Because you got to have the\nproper attitude. You've got to believe in yourself, and not in all the\nhistorical fictions they give you. Now do you understand? If you're\nskeptical enough and if at the same time you like to dream\nenough--that's all it takes. Want to try it?\"\n\nSuddenly the voice was gone. That was all there was and at first Danny\ncould not believe it. A sense of bitter disappointment enveloped\nhim--not because Uncle Averill had left him nothing but an old steamer\ntrunk but because Uncle Averill had been, to say the least, off his\nrocker.\n\nThe fabulous machine in the basement was--nothing.\n\nJust a steamer trunk and an incredible story about time-traveling.\n\nDanny sighed and began to walk back toward the cellar stairs. He paused.\nHe turned around uncertainly and looked at the trunk. After all, he had\npromised; at least he'd promised himself that he'd carry out his\npeculiar uncle's wishes. Besides, he'd come all the way down here from\nWhitney College and he ought to at least try the machine.\n\nBut there wasn't any machine.\n\nTry the trunk then? There was nothing to try except curling up in it and\nmaybe closing the lid. Uncle Averill was a practical joker, too. It\nmight be just like Uncle Averill to have the lid snap shut and lock\nautomatically so Danny would have to pound his knuckles black and blue\nuntil the lawyer heard and came for him.\n\nYou see, sonny? would be Uncle Averill's point. You believed me, and you\nshould have known better.\n\nDanny cursed himself and returned to the trunk. He gazed down at the\nyawning interior for a few seconds, then put first one foot, then the\nother over the side. He sat down and stared at a peeling blue-paper\nliner. He rolled over and curled up. The bottom of the trunk was a good\nfit. He reached up and found a rope dangling down toward him. He pulled\nthe lid down, smiling at his own credulity, and was engulfed in total\ndarkness.\n\nBut it would be wonderful, he found himself thinking. It would be the\nmost wonderful thing in the world, to be able to travel through time and\nsee for yourself what really had happened in all the world's colorful\nages and to take part in the wildest, proudest adventures of mankind.\n\nHe thought, I want to believe. It would be so wonderful to believe.\n\nHe also thought about his history class. He did not know it, but his\nhistory class was very important. It was crucial. Everything depended on\nhis history class. Because he doubted. He did not want to take Columbus'\nbravery and intelligence for granted. There were no surviving documents,\nso why should he?\n\nMaybe Columbus was a third-rater!\n\nMaybe--at least you didn't have to worship him as a hero just because he\nhappened to discover ...\n\nNow, what did he discover?\n\nIn absolute darkness and a ringing in the ears and far away a dim\nglowing light and larger and brighter and the whirling whirling spinning\nflashing I don't believe but strangely somehow I have faith, faith in\nmyself, buzzing, humming, glowing ...\n\nThe world exploded.\n\nThere was a great deal of laughter in the tavern.\n\nAt first he thought the laughter was directed at him. Giddily, he raised\nhis head. He saw raw wood rafters, a leaded glass window, a stained and\ngreasy wall, heavy wood-plank tables with heavy chairs and a\nbarbarous-looking crew drinking from heavy clay mugs. One of the mugs\nwas in front of him and he raised it to his lips without thinking.\n\nIt was ale, the strongest ale he had ever tasted. He got it down somehow\nwithout gagging. The laughter came again, rolling over him like a wave.\nA serving girl scurried by, skirts flashing, a rough tray of clay mugs\nbalanced expertly on one hand. A man with a sword dangling at his side\nstaggered to his feet drunkenly and clawed at the girl, but she shoved\nhim back into his seat and kept walking.\n\nThe third wave of laughter rolled and then there was a brief silence.\n\n\"Drink too much, Martin Pinzon?\" Danny's companion at the long\nboard-table asked. He was an evil-looking old man with a patch over one\neye and a small white spade-shaped beard and unshaven cheeks.\n\n\"Not me,\" Danny said, amazed because the language was unfamiliar to him\nyet he could both understand and speak it. \"What's so funny?\" he asked.\n\"Why's everyone laughing?\"\n\nThe old man's hand slapped his back and the mouth parted to show ugly\nblackened teeth and the old man laughed so hard spittle spotted his\nbeard. \"As if you didn't know,\" he managed to say. \"As if you didn't\nknow, Martin Pinzon. It's that weak-minded sailor again, the one who\nclaims to have a charter for three caravels from the Queen herself.\nDrunk as Bacchus and there's his pretty little daughter trying to get\nhim to come home again. I tell you, Martin Pinzon, if he isn't ...\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut now Danny wasn't listening. He looked around the tavern until he saw\nthe butt of all the laughter. Slowly, drawn irresistibly, Martin\nPinzon--or Danny Jones--got up and walked over there.\n\nThe man was drunk as Bacchus, all right. He was a man perhaps somewhat\ntaller than average. He had a large head with an arrogant beak of a nose\ndominating the face, but the mouth was weak and irresolute. He stared\ndrunkenly at a beautiful girl who could not have been more than\nseventeen.\n\nThe girl was saying, \"Please, papa. Come back to the hotel with me.\nPapa, don't you realize you're sailing tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Gowananlemebe,\" the man mumbled.\n\n\"Papa. Please. The Queen's charter--\"\n\n\"I was drunk when I took it and drunk when I examined those three\nstinking caravels and--\" he leaned forward as if to speak in deepest\nconfidence, but his drunken voice was still very loud--\"and drunk when I\nsaid the world was round. I--\"\n\n\"You hear that?\" someone cried. \"Old Chris was drunk when he said the\nworld was round!\"\n\n\"He must a' been!\" someone else shouted. Everyone laughed.\n\n\"Come on, papa,\" the girl pleaded. She wore a shawl over her dress and\nanother shawl on her head. Her blonde hair barely peeked out, and she\nwas beautiful. She tried to drag her father to his feet by one arm, but\nhe was too heavy for her.\n\nShe looked around the room defiantly as the laughter surged again.\n\"Brave men!\" she mocked. \"A bunch of stay-at-homes. Won't somebody help\nme? Papa sails tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Papa sails tomorrow,\" said someone, miming her desperate tones. \"Didn't\nyou know that papa sails tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Not sailing anyplace at all,\" the father mumbled. \"World isn't round.\nDrunk. Think I want to fall over the edge? Think I--\"\n\n\"Oh, papa,\" moaned the girl. \"Won't someone help me to--\" And she tugged\nagain at the man's arm--\"to get him to bed.\"\n\nA big man nearby boomed, \"I'll help you t'bed, me lass, but it won't be\nwith your old father. Eh, mates?\" he cried, and the tavern echoed with\nlaughter. The big man got up and went over to the girl. \"Now, listen,\nlass,\" he said, taking hold of her arm. \"Why don't you forget this\ndrunken slob of a father and--\"\n\nCrack! Her hand blurred at his cheek, struck it like a pistol shot. The\nbig man blinked his eyes and grinned. \"So you have spirit, do you? Well,\nit's more than I can say for that father of yours, too yellow and too\ndrunk to carry out the Queen of Castile's bid--\"\n\nThe hand flashed out again but this time the big man caught it in one of\nhis own and twisted sideways against the girl, forcing her back against\nthe table's edge. \"I like my girls to struggle,\" he said, and the girl's\nface went white as she suddenly let herself go limp in his arms.\n\nThe man grinned. \"Oh I like 'em limp, me lass. When they're pretty as a\nrose, like you, who's to care?\"\n\n\"Papa!\" the girl screamed. The big man's face hovered over hers,\nblotting out the oil-lamp lights, the thick lips all but slavering....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Just a minute, man!\" Danny cried, striding boldly to them. Hardly\npausing in his efforts to kiss the again struggling girl, the big man\nswatted back with one enormous arm and sent Danny reeling. Whoever he\nwas, he was a popular figure. The laughter was still louder now.\nEveryone was having a great time, at Danny's expense now.\n\nDanny crashed into a chair, upending it. A bowl of soup came crashing\ndown, the heavy bowl splintering, the hot contents scalding him. He\nstood up and heard the girl scream. Instinctively, he grasped two legs\nof the heavy chair and hefted it. Then he sprinted back across the room.\n\n\"Behind you, Pietro!\" a voice cried, and at the last moment the big man\nwhirled and faced Danny, then lunged to one side, taking the girl with\nhim.\n\nDanny couldn't check his arms, which had carried the heavy chair\noverhead. It came down with a crash against the edge of the big plank\ntable. The chair shattered in Danny's arms. One leg flew up and struck\nthe big man in the face, though, bringing blood just below the cheek\nbone. He bellowed in surprise and pain and came lumbering toward Danny.\n\nDanny was aware of the girl cowering to one side, aware that another of\nthe chair's legs was still grasped in his right hand. He was but a boy,\nhe found himself thinking quickly, desperate. If the giant grabbed him,\ngrabbed him just once, the fight would be over. The man was twice his\nsize, twice his weight. Yet he had to do something to help the girl....\n\nThe giant came at him. The big arms lifted over the heavy, brutal\nface.... And Danny drove under them with the chair-leg, jabbing the tip\nof it against the man's enormous middle. Pietro--for such was the man's\nname--sagged a few inches, the breath rushing, heavy with garlic, from\nhis mouth. But still, he got his great hands about Danny's throat and\nbegan to squeeze.\n\nDanny saw the wood rafters, the window, a bargirl standing, mouth open,\nwatching them, the drunken man and his daughter, then a blurry, watery\nconfusion as his eyes went dim. He was conscious of swinging the club,\nof striking something, of extending the club out as far as it would go\nand then slamming it back toward himself, striking something which he\nhoped was Pietro's head. He felt his mouth going slack and wondered if\nhis tongue were hanging out. Exerting all his strength he struck numbly,\nmechanically, desperately with the chair-leg.\n\nAnd slowly, the constriction left his throat. Something struck against\nhis middle, almost knocking him down. Something pushed against his legs,\nbacking him against the table. He looked down. His eyes were watery, his\nthroat burning. The giant Pietro lay, breathing stertorously, at his\nfeet.\n\nA small hand grabbed his. \"Father will come now,\" a voice said. \"I\ndon't--don't even know who you are, but I want to thank you. I thank you\nfor myself and the Queen, and God, senor. You better come quickly, with\nus. Does it hurt much?\"\n\nDanny tried to talk. His voice rasped in his throat. The girl squeezed\nhis hand and together with her and the drunken man who was her father,\nhe left the tavern. The giant Pietro was just getting up and shaking his\nfist at them slowly....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a small top-floor room in an old waterfront building in the\nSpanish port of Palos. Or, Danny corrected himself, the Castillian port\nof Palos. Because, in this year of our Lord 1492, Spain had barely\nbecome a unified country.\n\n\"Are you feeling better, Martin Pinzon?\" the beautiful girl asked him.\n\nHe had given the name he had heard, Martin Pinzon, as his own. The room\nwas very hot. The August night outside was hot too and sultry and\nstarless. The girl's father was resting now, breathing unevenly. The\ngirl's name was Nina. One of the small caravels in her father's\nthree-ship fleet was named after her. Her full name was Nina Columbus.\n\nNina brought another wet cloth and covered Danny's swollen throat with\nit. \"Does it hurt much?\" she said, and, for the tenth time, \"we have no\nmoney to thank you with, senor.\"\n\n\"Any man would have--\"\n\n\"But you were the only one. The only--never mind. Martin, listen. I have\nno right to trouble you, but ... it's father. Tomorrow is the second day\nof August, you see, and it is all over Palos that tomorrow he sails with\nthe Queen's charter....\"\n\n\"Then if you're worrying about that big man, Pietro, you can forget it.\nIf you're sailing, I mean.\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" Nina said desperately. \"Father doesn't want to sail.\nMartin, tell me, do you believe the world is round?\"\n\nDanny nodded very soberly. \"Yes, Nina,\" he told her softly. \"The world\nis round. I believe it.\"\n\n\"My father doesn't! Funny, isn't it, Martin?\" she said in a voice which\ntold him she did not think it was funny at all. \"All Spain--and Genoa\ntoo--think that tomorrow morning my father, Christopher Columbus, will\njourney to the unexplored west confident that he will arrive, after a\nlong voyage, in the East--when really my father, this same Christopher\nColumbus, lies here in a drunken stupor because he lacks the courage to\nface his convictions and ... oh, Martin!\" Her voice broke, her pretty\nface crumpled. She sobbed into her hands. Gently, Danny stroked her\nback.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"There now, take it easy,\" he said. \"Your father will sail. I know he'll\nsail. Do you believe the world to be round, little Nina?\"\n\n\"Yes. Oh yes, yes, yes!\"\n\n\"He will sail. He will prove it and be famous. I know he will.\"\n\n\"Oh, Martin. You sound so sure of yourself. I wish I could ...\"\n\n\"Nina, listen. Your father will sail.\"\n\n\"You'll help us you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes. All right, I'll help you. Now, get some sleep if you want to wake\nup and say goodbye to him in the morning. Because I'll be getting him up\nbefore the sun to--\"\n\n\"Are you a sailing man too? Are you going with him?\"\n\n\"Well ...\"\n\n\"Wait! Martin, I remember you now. Martin Pinzon. At the meeting of the\norganization to prove the Earth's round shape. You! You were there. And\nonce, once when he was not drunk, father said that a Don Pinzon would\ncommand one of our three ships, the Nina it was, the caravel which\nbears my name. Are you this Don Pinzon?\"\n\nSlowly, Danny nodded. He remembered his history now. The Nina _had_ been\ncommanded by one Don Pinzon, Don Martin Pinzon! And he was now this\nMartin Pinzon, he, Danny Jones. Which meant he was going with Columbus\nto discover a new world! A nineteen-year-old American youth going to\nwitness the single most important event in American history....\n\n\"Yes,\" Danny said slowly, \"I am Don Pinzon.\"\n\n\"But--but you're so young!\"\n\nDanny shrugged. \"I have seen more of the world than you would believe,\nNina.\"\n\n\"The Western Sea? You have been out on the Western Sea, as far as the\nCanary Islands, perhaps?\" she asked in an awed voice.\n\n\"I know the Western Sea,\" he said. \"Trust me.\"\n\nShe came very close. She looked long in his eyes. \"I trust you, Martin.\nOh yes, I trust you. Listen, Martin. I'm going. I'm going with you. I\nhave to go with you.\"\n\n\"But a girl--\"\n\n\"He is my father. I love him, Martin. He needs me. Martin, don't try to\nstop me. I want you to help me aboard, to see that he ... oh, Martin,\nyou'll have so much to do. Because the rest of our crew--some of them\nbeing hired even now by the three caravel pursers--will be a crew of\ncut-throats and ne'er-do-wells embarking into the unknown because they\nhave utterly nothing to lose. Father needs you because the others won't\ncare.\"\n\n\"The three caravels will sail west,\" Danny told her. \"Believe me,\nthey'll sail west. Now, get some sleep.\"\n\nHer face was still very close. Her eyes filled with tears, but they were\nnot tears of sadness. She took his cheeks in her hands and kissed him\nsoftly on the lips. She smiled at him, her own lips trembling.\n\n\"Martin,\" she said.\n\nHis arms moved. They went around her, drew the softness of her close.\nShe murmured something, but he did not hear it. His lips found hers a\nsecond time, fiercely. His hands her shoulder, her throat, her ...\n\n\"Flat,\" Columbus mumbled. \"Flat. Abs'lutely flat. The Earth is--flat as\na pancake....\"\n\n\"Oh, Martin!\" Nina cried.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was raining in the morning. A hard, driving rain, pelting down on the\nseaport of Palos. The three caravels floated side by side in the little\nharbor and a large, derisive crowd had gathered. The crowd erupted into\nnoisy laughter when Columbus and his little party appeared on foot.\n\n\"I need a drink,\" Columbus whispered. \"I can't go through with it.\"\n\n\"Father,\" Nina said. \"We're with you. I'm here. Martin is here.\"\n\n\"I can't go--\"\n\n\"You've got to go through with it! For yourself and for the world. Now,\nstand straight, father. They're looking at you. They're all looking at\nyou.\"\n\nColumbus, thought Danny. The intrepid voyager who had discovered a new\nworld! He smiled grimly. Columbus, the history books should have said,\nthe drunken sot who didn't even have the courage to face his own\nconvictions.\n\nThey walked ahead through the ridiculing crowd. Danny's throat was still\nsore. He was not frightened, though. He possibly was the only man in the\ncrew who was not frightened. The others didn't care what their\ndestination was, true: but they wanted to reach it alive. Danny knew the\njourney would end in success. The end of the journey meant nothing to\nhim. It was written in history. It was ...\n\nUnless, he suddenly found himself thinking, I came back here to write\nit. He grinned at his own bravado. What would they have said in freshman\npsych--that was practically paranoid thinking. As if Danny Jones,\nWhitney College, Virginia, U.S.A., could have anything to do with the\nsuccess or failure of Columbus' journey.\n\nThey reached the small skiff that would take them out to the tiny fleet\nof caravels. The crowd hooted and jeered.\n\n\"... going to drop off the edge of the world, Columbus.\"\n\n\"If the monsters don't get you first.\"\n\n\"Or the storms and whirlpools.\"\n\nColumbus gripped Nina's hand. Martin-Danny took his other arm firmly and\nsteered him toward the prow of the skiff. \"Easy now, skipper,\" Danny\nsaid.\n\n\"I can't--\"\n\n\"There's wine on the Santa Maria,\" Danny whispered. \"Much wine--to make\nyou forget. Come on!\"\n\n\"And I'm going, father,\" Nina said. \"Whether you go or not.\"\n\n\"You!\" Columbus gasped. \"A girl. You, going--\"\n\n\"With Martin Pinzon. If--if my own father can't look after me, then\nMartin can.\"\n\n\"But you--\" Danny began.\n\n\"Be quiet, please,\" she whispered as Columbus climbed stiffly into the\nskiff. \"It may be the only way, Martin. He--he loves me. I guess I'm the\nonly thing he cares about. If he knows I'm going.\"\n\n\"To the Santa Maria!\" Columbus told the rowers as Danny and Nina got\ninto the skiff.\n\n\"To the New World!\" cried Danny melodramatically.\n\n\"What did you say?\" Nina asked him.\n\nHis face colored. \"I mean, to the Indies! To the Indies!\"\n\nThe skiff bobbed out across the harbor toward the three waiting\ncaravels. Departure time had arrived.\n\nTwo hours later, they were underway.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sea was calm as glass, green as emerald. The three caravels, after a\njourney of several days, had reached the Canary Islands where additional\nprovisions and fresh water were to be had.\n\n\"This,\" said Columbus, waving his arms to take in the chain of islands.\n\"This is as far as a mere man has a right to go. There is nothing\nfurther, can't you see? Can't you?\"\n\nHe was sober. Danny had come over in a skiff from the Nina to see that\nhe remained sober at least for the loading and the departure. It was\nas if he, Danny, was going to preserve Columbus' name for\nhistory--single-handed if necessary.\n\n\"We will not go on,\" Columbus said. \"We're going back. The only way to\nthe Indies is around the Cape of Storms, around Africa. I tell you--\"\n\n\"That's enough, father,\" Nina said. \"We ...\"\n\n\"I'm in command here,\" Columbus told them. It surprised Danny. Usually,\nthe drunken sailor was not so self-assertive. Then it occurred to Danny\nthat it wasn't merely self-assertiveness: it was fear.\n\nDanny called over the mate, a one-legged man named Juan, who walked with\na jaunty stride despite his peg leg. \"You take orders from Columbus?\"\nDanny said. \"Would you take orders from me?\"\n\nJuan shook his head, smiling. \"You command aboard the Nina only, Martin\nPinzon. I heard what the Captain said. If he wants to go back and give\nup this fool scheme, it's all right with me. And you know the rest of\nthe crew will say the same.\"\n\nNina looked at Danny hopelessly. She said, \"Then, then it's no use?\"\n\nDanny whispered fiercely, \"Your father loves you very much?\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"And doesn't want to see anything happen to you?\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"And believes the world is flat and if you sail far enough west you'll\nfall off?\"\n\n\"But I--\"\n\n\"Then you're coming with me aboard the Nina!\"\n\nColumbus gasped, \"What did you say?\"\n\n\"She's coming with me, on the Nina. If you don't want to find the\nwestern route to the Indies, we will. Right, Nina?\" he said, taking her\nhand and moving to where the rope-ladder dangled over the side of the\nSanta Maria to the skiff below.\n\n\"Don't take her from this deck,\" Columbus ordered.\n\nDanny ignored him. \"Don Juan!\" cried Columbus, and the peg-leg came\ntoward Danny.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Don Martin,\" he said, \"but--\"\n\nStill holding Nina's hand, Martin stiff-armed him out of the way and ran\nfor the side. Someone jerked the rope-ladder out of reach and someone\nelse leaped on Martin. For, he was Martin now, Martin Pinzon. His own\nidentity seemed submerged far below the surface, as if somehow he could\nlook on all this without risking anything. He knew that he was merely a\ndefense mechanism, to ward off fear: for, it wasn't true. If Martin\nPinzon were hurt, _he_ would be hurt.\n\nHe hurled the man from his back. Nina screamed as a cutlass flashed in\nthe sun. Martin-Danny ducked, felt the blade whizz by overhead.\n\n\"Jump!\" Martin-Danny cried.\n\n\"But I can't swim!\"\n\n\"I can. I'll save you.\" It was Danny again, completely Danny. He felt\nhimself arise to the surface, submerging Martin Pinzon. Because the\nSpaniard probably couldn't swim at all, and if Danny made promises, it\nwas Danny who must fulfill them.\n\nHe squeezed Nina's hand. He went up on the side--and over. The water\nseemed a very long way down. They hit it finally with a great splash.\n\nDown they went and down, into the warm murky green depths. Down--and\nfinally up. Danny's head broke surface. He was only yards from the\nskiff. He had never let go of Nina's hand, but now he did, getting a\nlifeguard's hold on her. He struck out for the skiff.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFifteen minutes later, they were aboard the Nina. \"I command here,\"\nDanny told the crew. \"Is that correct?\"\n\n\"Aye, sir,\" said Don Hernan, the mate.\n\n\"Even if Columbus tells you different?\"\n\n\"Columbus?\" spat Don Hernan. \"That drunkard is in command of the Santa\nMaria, not the Nina. We follow Martin Pinzon here.\"\n\n\"Even if I give one set of orders and Columbus another?\"\n\n\"Even then, my commander. Yes.\"\n\n\"Then we're sailing west,\" Danny cried. \"Up anchor! Hurry.\"\n\n\"But I--\" Nina began.\n\n\"Don't you see? He thinks I'm abducting you. Or he thinks I'm sailing\nwest with you to certain death. He will follow with the Santa Maria and\nthe Pinta, trying to rescue you. And we'll reach the Indies. Columbus\nwill sail across the Western Sea to save his daughter, but what's the\ndifference _why_ he'll sail. The important thing is, Queen Isabella gave\nhim the charter and the caravels and with them he's making history. You\nsee?\"\n\n\"I ... I think so,\" Nina said doubtfully.\n\nA heady wind sprang up. The square-rigged sails billowed. The Nina began\nto surge forward--into the unknown West.\n\nTackle creaked aboard the nearby Santa Maria and Pinta. The two other\ncaravels came in pursuit. But they won't catch us, Martin knew. They\nwon't catch us until we reach--Hispaniola. And then, pursuit will be no\nmore. Then, it will no longer matter and we'll all be heroes....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhich is the way it turned out--almost.\n\nThe Santa Maria and Pinta pursued all through August and September and\ninto October, but the Nina kept its slim lead. The ships were never out\nof sight of one another and once or twice Columbus even hailed them,\nimploring them to return to Spain with him. When they ignored him, his\ndeep voice boomed to his own crew and the crew of the Pinta: \"Then sail\non, sail on!\" It was these words, Danny knew, that history would record.\nNot the others.\n\nOne morning in October, he awoke with a start. Something had disturbed\nhis sleep--something ...\n\n\"Good morning, captain,\" a voice said.\n\nHe looked up. It was a giant of a man, with a hard face and\nbrutal-looking eyes. He knew that face. Pietro! The giant of the tavern.\n\n\"But you--\"\n\n\"I was aboard all the time, my captain,\" Pietro said. \"An auxiliary\nrower. You never knew.\" He said nothing else. He lunged at Martin's\nbunk--for I'm Martin again, Danny thought--a knife gleaming in his big\nhand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMartin-Danny sat up, bringing the covers with him, hurling them like a\ncloak at Pietro. The giant's knife-hand caught in the covers and Danny\nswung to his feet, shoving the big man. Pietro stumbled into the bunk,\nthen lashed around quickly, unexpectedly, the knife loose again. Danny\nfelt it grating across his ribs hotly, searingly. He staggered and\nalmost fell, but somehow made it to the door and on deck. He needed\nroom. Facing that knife in the close confines of the cabin, he was a\ndead man and knew it.\n\nHe hit the stairs and headed for the deck. He reached the door--tugged.\nIt held fast. He heard Pietro's laughter, then threw himself to one\nside. The knife thudded into the wood alongside Danny's shoulder.\n\nThen the door came open, throwing him back. He stumbled, regained his\nbalance, plunged outside. With a roar, Pietro followed him, knife again\nin hand.\n\nDanny backed away slowly. Only a few crew members were on deck now, and\na watch high up in the crow's nest. The watch was crying in an\nalmost-delirious voice: \"Land, land! Land ho-oo!\" But Martin-Danny\nhardly heard the words. Pietro came at him--\n\nSuddenly Don Hernan was in front of him. Don Hernan's hand nipped up and\nthen down and a knife arced toward Danny. He caught it by the haft,\nswung to face the giant. But, he thought, I don't know how to use a\nknife. I'm Danny Jones, I ...\n\nPietro leaped, the knife down, held loosely at his side, underhanded,\nready to slash and rip. Danny sidestepped and Pietro went by in a rush.\nDanny waited.\n\nPietro came back carefully this time, crouching, balanced easily on the\nballs of his feet. For all his size, he fought with the grace of a\ndancer.\n\nDanny felt warm wetness where the blood was seeping from his ribs. Feet\npounded as more of the crew came on deck in response to the watch's\ndelirious words. Instead of crowding at the prow, though, they formed a\ncircle around Danny and Pietro. Danny thought: But I'm the captain. The\ncaptain. They ought to help me ... they ... He knew though that they\nwould not. They were a fierce, proud people and the law of single combat\nwould apply even to the captain who had piloted them across an unknown\nocean.\n\nPietro came by, attempting to slash with his knife from outside. Danny\nmoved quickly--not quick enough. The knife point caught his arm this\ntime. He felt his hand go numb. His own knife clattered to the deck as\nblood oozed from his biceps.\n\nOnce more Pietro charged him. Weaponless, Danny waited. Pietro was\nlaughing, sure of himself--\n\nCareless.\n\nDanny slipped aside as Pietro brought the knife around in a wicked\nswipe. He spun with it and when he came around Danny was waiting for\nhim. He drove his left fist into the great belly and his right to the\nbig, bearded jaw. Pietro slumped, disbelief in his eyes. He swung the\nknife again but only succeeded in wrapping his giant arm around Danny.\nHe bent his head, shook it to clear it of the sting of Danny's blows.\nAnd Danny rabbit-punched him.\n\nPietro went down heavily and someone shouted. \"The face! Kick him in the\nface!\"\n\nWearily, Danny shook his head. He went with Nina to the rail and saw the\ngreen palm-fringed island of the New World. Nina smiled at him, then\nripped something from what she was wearing and began to bandage his\nribs, his arm.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey heard a splash. Danny looked around, saw Don Hernan and a member of\nthe crew gazing serenely down. Pietro was down there, where they had\ntossed him. For a while the body floated, then the limbs splashed wildly\nas Pietro regained consciousness. He drifted back away from the ship. He\nwent under, and came up. He went under again, and stayed under....\n\n\"The Indies,\" Nina said.\n\n\"The Indies,\" Danny said. He did not make the distinction between east\nand west. They must learn for themselves.\n\nThe Pinta and the Santa Maria came up alongside. All thoughts of pursuit\nwere gone. Columbus waved. He was very close now on the deck of the\nSanta Maria. There was something in his face, something changed.\nColumbus was a new man now. He had been shamed. He had followed his\ndaughter and Martin Pinzon across an unknown ocean and he was changed\nnow. Somehow, Danny knew he could now make voyages on his own.\n\n\"Martin,\" Nina whispered. \"They may say it was father. But it was you.\nI'll know in my heart, it was you.\"\n\nDanny nodded. She put her arm around his shoulder, and kissed him. He\nliked this slim girl--he liked her immensely, and it wasn't right. She\nwasn't his, not really. She was Martin Pinzon's. He let the Spaniard\ncome to the surface, willed his own mind back and down and away. She's\nall yours, Pinzon, he told the other mind in his body. She--and this\nworld. I'm a--stranger here.\n\nBut once more he kissed Nina, fiercely, with passion and longing.\n\n\"Goodbye, my darling,\" he said.\n\n\"Goodbye! What--\"\n\nHe let Martin Pinzon take it from there. \"Hello,\" said Martin Pinzon.\n\"I mean, hello forever, darling.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"Goodbye to your bachelorhood, you mean.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Yes.\"\n\nBut it was Martin Pinzon talking now. Completely Martin Pinzon.\n\nHe was back in his grand-uncle's basement. He was in the trunk and he\nfelt stiff. Mostly, his right arm and the right ribs felt stiff. He felt\nhis shirt. It was caked with blood.\n\nProof, he thought. If I needed proof. What happened to Pinzon happened\nto me.\n\nHe stood up. He felt weak, but knew he would be all right. He knew about\nColumbus now. At first, a weak drunkard. But after the first voyage,\nthanks to Martin Pinzon and Nina, an intrepid voyager. For history said\nColumbus would make four voyages to the New World--and four he would\nmake.\n\nDanny went outside, to where the lawyer was waiting for him. The trunk\nwas Danny's now, the time trunk. And he would use it again, often. He\nknew that now, and it was wrong to deflate a dream.\n\nColumbus was a hero. He would never say otherwise again.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ October 1956.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
