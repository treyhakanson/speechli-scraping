The Ambassador hardly\nlooked like a menace. He was of medium height and slight build,\ndressed in a conservative brown tweed suit that the State Department\nhad given him. His face was intelligent, finely molded and aloof.\n\n_As human as a human_, Cercy thought, studying the alien with bleak,\nimpersonal eyes.\n\n\"How may I serve you?\" the Ambassador asked, smiling.\n\n\"The President has put me in charge of your case,\" Cercy said. \"I've\nstudied Professor Darrig's reports--\" he nodded at the scientist\nbeside him--\"but I'd like to hear the whole thing for myself.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the alien said, lighting a cigarette. He seemed genuinely\npleased to be asked; which was interesting, Cercy thought. In the week\nsince he had landed, every important scientist in the country had been\nat him.\n\n_But in a pinch they call the Army_, Cercy reminded himself. He\nsettled back in his chair, both hands jammed carelessly in his\npockets. His right hand was resting on the butt of a .45, the safety\noff.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I have come,\" the alien said, \"as an ambassador-at-large,\nrepresenting an empire that stretches half-way across the Galaxy. I\nwish to extend the welcome of my people and to invite you to join our\norganization.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Cercy replied. \"Some of the scientists got the impression\nthat participation was compulsory.\"\n\n\"You will join,\" the Ambassador said, blowing smoke through his\nnostrils.\n\nCercy could see Darrig stiffen in his chair and bite his lip. Cercy\nmoved the automatic to a position where he could draw it easily. \"How\ndid you find us?\" he asked.\n\n\"We ambassadors-at-large are each assigned an unexplored section of\nspace,\" the alien said. \"We examine each star-system in that region\nfor planets, and each planet for intelligent life. Intelligent life is\nrare in the Galaxy, you know.\"\n\nCercy nodded, although he hadn't been aware of the fact.\n\n\"When we find such a planet, we land, as I did, and prepare the\ninhabitants for their part in our organization.\"\n\n\"How will your people know that you have found intelligent life?\"\nCercy asked.\n\n\"There is a sending mechanism that is part of our structure,\" the\nAmbassador answered. \"It is triggered when we reach an inhabited\nplanet. This signal is beamed continually into space, to an effective\nrange of several thousand light-years. Follow-up crews are continually\nsweeping through the limits of the reception area of each Ambassador,\nlistening for such messages. Detecting one, a colonizing team follows\nit to the planet.\"\n\nHe tapped his cigarette delicately on the edge of an ash tray. \"This\nmethod has definite advantages over sending combined colonization and\nexploration teams obviously. It avoids the necessity of equipping\nlarge forces for what may be decades of searching.\"\n\n\"Sure.\" Cercy's face was expressionless. \"Would you tell me more about\nthis message?\"\n\n\"There isn't much more you need know. The beam is not detectable by\nyour methods and, therefore, cannot be jammed. The message continues\nas long as I am alive.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDarrig drew in his breath sharply, glancing at Cercy.\n\n\"If you stopped broadcasting,\" Cercy said casually, \"our planet would\nnever be found.\"\n\n\"Not until this section of space was resurveyed,\" the diplomat agreed.\n\n\"Very well. As a duly appointed representative of the President of the\nUnited States, I ask you to stop transmitting. We don't choose to\nbecome part of your empire.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" the Ambassador said. He shrugged his shoulders easily.\nCercy wondered how many times he had played this scene on how many\nother planets.\n\n\"There's really nothing I can do.\" He stood up.\n\n\"Then you won't stop?\"\n\n\"I can't. I have no control over the sending, once it's activated.\"\nThe diplomat turned and walked to the window. \"However, I have\nprepared a philosophy for you. It is my duty, as your Ambassador, to\nease the shock of transition as much as possible. This philosophy will\nmake it instantly apparent that--\"\n\nAs the Ambassador reached the window, Cercy's gun was out of his\npocket and roaring. He squeezed six rounds in almost a single\nexplosion, aiming at the Ambassador's head and back. Then an\nuncontrollable shudder ran through him.\n\nThe Ambassador was no longer there!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCercy and Darrig stared at each other. Darrig muttered something about\nghosts. Then, just as suddenly, the Ambassador was back.\n\n\"You didn't think,\" he said, \"that it would be as easy as all that,\ndid you? We Ambassadors have, necessarily, a certain diplomatic\nimmunity.\" He fingered one of the bullet holes in the wall. \"In case\nyou don't understand, let me put it this way. It is not in your power\nto kill me. You couldn't even understand the nature of my defense.\"\n\nHe looked at them, and in that moment Cercy felt the Ambassador's\ncomplete alienness.\n\n\"Good day, gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nDarrig and Cercy walked silently back to the control room. Neither had\nreally expected that the Ambassador would be killed so easily, but it\nhad still been a shock when the slugs had failed.\n\n\"I suppose you saw it all, Malley?\" Cercy asked, when he reached the\ncontrol room.\n\nThe thin, balding psychiatrist nodded sadly. \"Got it on film, too.\"\n\n\"I wonder what his philosophy is,\" Darrig mused, half to himself.\n\n\"It was illogical to expect it would work. No race would send an\nambassador with a message like that and expect him to live through it.\nUnless--\"\n\n\"Unless what?\"\n\n\"Unless he had a pretty effective defense,\" the psychiatrist finished\nunhappily.\n\nCercy walked across the room and looked at the video panel. The\nAmbassador's suite was very special. It had been hurriedly constructed\ntwo days after he had landed and delivered his message. The suite was\nsteel and lead lined, filled with video and movie cameras, recorders,\nand a variety of other things.\n\nIt was the last word in elaborate death cells.\n\nIn the screen, Cercy could see the Ambassador sitting at a table. He\nwas typing on a little portable the Government had given him.\n\n\"Hey, Harrison!\" Cercy called. \"Might as well go ahead with Plan Two.\"\n\nHarrison came out of a side room where he had been examining the\ncircuits leading to the Ambassador's suite. Methodically he checked\nhis pressure gauges, set the controls and looked at Cercy. \"Now?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Now.\" Cercy watched the screen. The Ambassador was still typing.\n\nSuddenly, as Harrison sent home the switch, the room was engulfed in\nflames. Fire blasted out of concealed holes in the walls, poured from\nthe ceiling and floor.\n\nIn a moment, the room was like the inside of a blast furnace.\n\nCercy let it burn for two minutes, then motioned Harrison to cut the\nswitch. They stared at the roasted room.\n\nThey were looking, hopefully, for a charred corpse.\n\nBut the Ambassador reappeared beside his desk, looking ruefully at the\ncharred typewriter. He was completely unsinged.\n\n\"Could you get me another typewriter?\" he asked, looking directly at\none of the hidden projectors. \"I'm setting down a philosophy for you\nungrateful wretches.\"\n\nHe seated himself in the wreckage of an armchair. In a moment, he was\napparently asleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"All right, everyone grab a seat,\" Cercy said. \"Time for a council of\nwar.\"\n\nMalley straddled a chair backward. Harrison lighted a pipe as he sat\ndown, slowly puffing it into life.\n\n\"Now, then,\" Cercy said. \"The Government has dropped this squarely in\nour laps. We have to kill the Ambassador--obviously. I've been put in\ncharge.\" Cercy grinned with regret. \"Probably because no one higher up\nwants the responsibility of failure. And I've selected you three as my\nstaff. We can have anything we want, any assistance or advice we need.\nAll right. Any ideas?\"\n\n\"How about Plan Three?\" Harrison asked.\n\n\"We'll get to that,\" Cercy said. \"But I don't believe it's going to\nwork.\"\n\n\"I don't either,\" Darrig agreed. \"We don't even know the nature of his\ndefense.\"\n\n\"That's the first order of business. Malley, take all our data so far,\nand get someone to feed it into the Derichman Analyzer. You know the\nstuff we want. What properties has X, if X can do thus and thus?\"\n\n\"Right,\" Malley said. He left, muttering something about the\nascendancy of the physical sciences.\n\n\"Harrison,\" Cercy asked, \"is Plan Three set up?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Give it a try.\"\n\nWhile Harrison was making his last adjustments, Cercy watched Darrig.\nThe plump little physicist was staring thoughtfully into space,\nmuttering to himself. Cercy hoped he would come up with something. He\nwas expecting great things of Darrig.\n\nKnowing the impossibility of working with great numbers of people,\nCercy had picked his staff with care. Quality was what he wanted.\n\nWith that in mind, he had chosen Harrison first. The stocky,\nsour-faced engineer had a reputation for being able to build anything,\ngiven half an idea of how it worked.\n\nCercy had selected Malley, the psychiatrist, because he wasn't sure\nthat killing the Ambassador was going to be a purely physical problem.\n\nDarrig was a mathematical physicist, but his restless, curious mind\nhad come up with some interesting theories in other fields. He was the\nonly one of the four who was really interested in the Ambassador as an\nintellectual problem.\n\n\"He's like Metal Old Man,\" Darrig said finally.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Haven't you ever heard the story of Metal Old Man? Well, he was a\nmonster covered with black metal armor. He was met by Monster-Slayer,\nan Apache culture hero. Monster-Slayer, after many attempts, finally\nkilled Metal Old Man.\"\n\n\"How did he do it?\"\n\n\"Shot him in the armpit. He didn't have any armor there.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Cercy grinned. \"Ask our Ambassador to raise his arm.\"\n\n\"All set!\" Harrison called.\n\n\"Fine. Go.\"\n\nIn the Ambassador's room, an invisible spray of gamma rays silently\nbegan to flood the room with deadly radiation.\n\nBut there was no Ambassador to receive them.\n\n\"That's enough,\" Cercy said, after a while. \"That would kill a herd of\nelephants.\"\n\nBut the Ambassador stayed invisible for five hours, until some of the\nradioactivity had abated. Then he appeared again.\n\n\"I'm still waiting for that typewriter,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Here's the Analyzer's report.\" Malley handed Cercy a sheaf of papers.\n\"This is the final formulation, boiled down.\"\n\nCercy read it aloud: \"The simplest defense against any and all\nweapons, is to _become_ each particular weapon.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Harrison said. \"What does it mean?\"\n\n\"It means,\" Darrig explained, \"that when we attack the Ambassador with\nfire, he turns into fire. Shoot at him, and he turns into a\nbullet--until the menace is gone, and then he changes back again.\" He\ntook the papers out of Cercy's hand and riffled through them.\n\n\"Hmm. Wonder if there's any historical parallel? Don't suppose so.\" He\nraised his head. \"Although this isn't conclusive, it seems logical\nenough. Any other defense would involve recognition of the weapon\nfirst, then an appraisal, then a countermove predicated on the\npotentialities of the weapon. The Ambassador's defense would be a lot\nfaster and safer. He wouldn't have to recognize the weapon. I suppose\nhis body simply _identifies_, in some way, with the menace at hand.\"\n\n\"Did the Analyzer say there was any way of breaking this defense?\"\nCercy asked.\n\n\"The Analyzer stated definitely that there was no way, if the premise\nwere true,\" Malley answered gloomily.\n\n\"We can discard that judgment,\" Darrig said. \"The machine is limited.\"\n\n\"But we still haven't got any way of stopping him,\" Malley pointed\nout. \"And he's still broadcasting that beam.\"\n\nCercy thought for a moment. \"Call in every expert you can find. We're\ngoing to throw the book at the Ambassador. I know,\" he said, looking\nat Darrig's dubious expression, \"but we have to try.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the next few days, every combination and permutation of death\nwas thrown at the Ambassador. He was showered with weapons, ranging\nfrom Stone-Age axes to modern high-powered rifles, peppered with hand\ngrenades, drowned in acid, suffocated in poison gas.\n\nHe kept shrugging his shoulders philosophically, and continued to work\non the new typewriter they had given him.\n\nBacteria was piped in, first the known germ diseases, then mutated\nspecies.\n\nThe diplomat didn't even sneeze.\n\nHe was showered with electricity, radiation, wooden weapons, iron\nweapons, copper weapons, brass weapons, uranium weapons--anything and\neverything, just to cover all possibilities.\n\nHe didn't suffer a scratch, but his room looked as though a bar-room\nbrawl had been going on in it continually for fifty years.\n\nMalley was working on an idea of his own, as was Darrig. The physicist\ninterrupted himself long enough to remind Cercy of the Baldur myth.\nBaldur had been showered with every kind of weapon and remained\nunscathed, because everything on Earth had promised to love him.\nEverything, except the mistletoe. When a little twig of it was shot at\nhim, he died.\n\nCercy turned away impatiently, but had an order of mistletoe sent up,\njust in case.\n\nIt was, at least, no less effective than the explosive shells or the\nbow and arrow. It did nothing except lend an oddly festive air to the\nbattered room.\n\nAfter a week of this, they moved the unprotesting Ambassador into a\nnewer, bigger, stronger death cell. They were unable to venture into\nhis old one because of the radioactivity and micro-organisms.\n\nThe Ambassador went back to work at his typewriter. All his previous\nattempts had been burned, torn or eaten away.\n\n\"Let's go talk to him,\" Darrig suggested, after another day had\npassed. Cercy agreed. For the moment, they were out of ideas.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Come right in, gentlemen,\" the Ambassador said, so cheerfully that\nCercy felt sick. \"I'm sorry I can't offer you anything. Through an\noversight, I haven't been given any food or water for about ten days.\nNot that it matters, of course.\"\n\n\"Glad to hear it,\" Cercy said. The Ambassador hardly looked as if he\nhad been facing all the violence Earth had to offer. On the contrary,\nCercy and his men looked as though they had been under bombardment.\n\n\"You've got quite a defense there,\" Malley said conversationally.\n\n\"Glad you like it.\"\n\n\"Would you mind telling us how it works?\" Darrig asked innocently.\n\n\"Don't you know?\"\n\n\"We think so. You become what is attacking you. Is that right?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" the Ambassador said. \"You see, I have no secrets from\nyou.\"\n\n\"Is there anything we can give you,\" Cercy asked, \"to get you to turn\noff that signal?\"\n\n\"A bribe?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Cercy said. \"Anything you--?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" the Ambassador replied.\n\n\"Look, be reasonable,\" Harrison said. \"You don't want to cause a war,\ndo you? Earth is united now. We're arming--\"\n\n\"With what?\"\n\n\"Atom bombs,\" Malley answered him. \"Hydrogen bombs. We're--\"\n\n\"Drop one on me,\" the Ambassador said. \"It wouldn't kill me. What\nmakes you think it will have any effect on my people?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe four men were silent. Somehow, they hadn't thought of that.\n\n\"A people's ability to make war,\" the Ambassador stated, \"is a measure\nof the status of their civilization. Stage one is the use of simple\nphysical extensions. Stage two is control at the molecular level. You\nare on the threshold of stage three, although still far from mastery\nof atomic and subatomic forces.\" He smiled ingratiatingly. \"My people\nare reaching the limits of stage five.\"\n\n\"What would that be?\" Darrig asked.\n\n\"You'll find out,\" the Ambassador said. \"But perhaps you've wondered\nif my powers are typical? I don't mind telling you that they're not.\nIn order for me to do my job and nothing more, I have certain built-in\nrestrictions, making me capable only of passive action.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Darrig asked.\n\n\"For obvious reasons. If I were to take positive action in a moment of\nanger, I might destroy your entire planet.\"\n\n\"Do you expect us to believe that?\" Cercy asked.\n\n\"Why not? Is it so hard to understand? Can't you believe that there\nare forces you know nothing about? And there is another reason for my\npassiveness. Certainly by this time you've deduced it?\"\n\n\"To break our spirit, I suppose,\" Cercy said.\n\n\"Exactly. My telling you won't make any difference, either. The\npattern is always the same. An Ambassador lands and delivers his\nmessage to a high-spirited, wild young race like yours. There is\nfrenzied resistance against him, spasmodic attempts to kill him. After\nall these fail, the people are usually quite crestfallen. When the\ncolonization team arrives, their indoctrination goes along just that\nmuch faster.\" He paused, then said, \"Most planets are more interested\nin the philosophy I have to offer. I assure you, it will make the\ntransition far easier.\"\n\nHe held out a sheaf of typewritten pages. \"Won't you at least look\nthrough it?\"\n\nDarrig accepted the papers and put them in his pocket. \"When I get\ntime.\"\n\n\"I suggest you give it a try,\" the Ambassador said. \"You must be near\nthe crisis point now. Why not give it up?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" Cercy replied tonelessly.\n\n\"Don't forget to read the philosophy,\" the Ambassador urged them.\n\nThe men hurried from the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now look,\" Malley said, once they were back in the control room,\n\"there are a few things we haven't tried. How about utilizing\npsychology?\"\n\n\"Anything you like,\" Cercy agreed, \"including black magic. What did\nyou have in mind?\"\n\n\"The way I see it,\" Malley answered, \"the Ambassador is geared to\nrespond, instantaneously, to any threat. He must have an\nall-or-nothing defensive reflex. I suggest first that we try something\nthat won't trigger that reflex.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" Cercy asked.\n\n\"Hypnotism. Perhaps we can find out something.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Cercy said. \"Try it. Try anything.\"\n\nCercy, Malley and Darrig gathered around the video screen as an\ninfinitesimal amount of a light hypnotic gas was admitted into the\nAmbassador's room. At the same time, a bolt of electricity lashed into\nthe chair where the Ambassador was sitting.\n\n\"That was to distract him,\" Malley explained. The Ambassador vanished\nbefore the electricity struck him, and then appeared again, curled up\nin his armchair.\n\n\"That's enough,\" Malley whispered, and shut the valve. They watched.\nAfter a while, the Ambassador put down his book and stared into the\ndistance.\n\n\"How strange,\" he said. \"Alfern dead. Good friend ... just a freak\naccident. He ran into it, out there. Didn't have a chance. But it\ndoesn't happen often.\"\n\n\"He's thinking out loud,\" Malley whispered, although there was no\npossibility of the Ambassador's hearing them. \"Vocalizing his\nthoughts. His friend must have been on his mind for some time.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the Ambassador went on, \"Alfern had to die sometime. No\nimmortality--yet. But that way--no defense. Out there in space they\njust pop up. Always there, underneath, just waiting for a chance to\nboil out.\"\n\n\"His body isn't reacting to the hypnotic as a menace yet,\" Cercy\nwhispered.\n\n\"Well,\" the Ambassador told himself, \"the regularizing principle has\nbeen doing pretty well, keeping it all down, smoothing out the\ninconsistencies--\"\n\nSuddenly he leaped to his feet, his face pale for a moment, as he\nobviously tried to remember what he had said. Then he laughed.\n\n\"Clever. That's the first time that particular trick has been played\non me, and the last time. But, gentlemen, it didn't do you any good. I\ndon't know, myself, how to go about killing me.\" He laughed at the\nblank walls.\n\n\"Besides,\" he continued, \"the colonizing team must have the direction\nnow. They'll find you with or without me.\"\n\nHe sat down again, smiling.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That does it!\" Darrig cried. \"He's not invulnerable. Something killed\nhis friend Alfern.\"\n\n\"Something out in space,\" Cercy reminded him. \"I wonder what it was.\"\n\n\"Let me see,\" Darrig reflected aloud. \"The regularizing principle.\nThat must be a natural law we knew nothing about. And underneath--what\nwould be underneath?\"\n\n\"He said the colonization team would find us anyhow,\" Malley reminded\nthem.\n\n\"First things first,\" Cercy said. \"He might have been bluffing us ...\nno, I don't suppose so. We still have to get the Ambassador out of the\nway.\"\n\n\"I think I know what is underneath!\" Darrig exclaimed. \"This is\nwonderful. A new cosmology, perhaps.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Cercy asked. \"Anything we can use?\"\n\n\"I think so. But let me work it out. I think I'll go back to my hotel.\nI have some books there I want to check, and I don't want to be\ndisturbed for a few hours.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Cercy agreed. \"But what--?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"No, no, I could be wrong,\" Darrig said. \"Let me work it out.\" He\nhurried from the room.\n\n\"What do you think he's driving at?\" Malley asked.\n\n\"Beats me,\" Cercy shrugged. \"Come on, let's try some more of that\npsychological stuff.\"\n\nFirst they filled the Ambassador's room with several feet of water.\nNot enough to drown him, just enough to make him good and\nuncomfortable.\n\nTo this, they added the lights. For eight hours, lights flashed in the\nAmbassador's room. Bright lights to pry under his eyelids; dull,\nclashing ones to disturb him.\n\nSound came next--screeches and screams and shrill, grating noises. The\nsound of a man's fingernails being dragged across slate, amplified a\nthousand times, and strange, sucking noises, and shouts and whispers.\n\nThen, the smells. Then, everything else they could think of that could\ndrive a man insane.\n\nThe Ambassador slept peacefully through it all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now look,\" Cercy said, the following day, \"let's start using our\ndamned heads.\" His voice was hoarse and rough. Although the\npsychological torture hadn't bothered the Ambassador, it seemed to\nhave backfired on Cercy and his men.\n\n\"Where in hell is Darrig?\"\n\n\"Still working on that idea of his,\" Malley said, rubbing his stubbled\nchin. \"Says he's just about got it.\"\n\n\"We'll work on the assumption that he can't produce,\" Cercy said.\n\"Start thinking. For example, if the Ambassador can turn into\nanything, what is there he can't turn into?\"\n\n\"Good question,\" Harrison grunted.\n\n\"It's the payoff question,\" Cercy said. \"No use throwing a spear at a\nman who can turn into one.\"\n\n\"How about this?\" Malley asked. \"Taking it for granted he can turn\ninto anything, how about putting him in a situation where he'll be\nattacked even _after_ he alters?\"\n\n\"I'm listening,\" Cercy said.\n\n\"Say he's in danger. He turns into the thing threatening him. What if\n_that thing_ were itself being threatened? And, in turn, was in the\nact of threatening something else? What would he do then?\"\n\n\"How are you going to put that into action?\" Cercy asked.\n\n\"Like this.\" Malley picked up the telephone. \"Hello? Give me the\nWashington Zoo. This is urgent.\"\n\nThe Ambassador turned as the door opened. An unwilling, angry, hungry\ntiger was propelled in. The door slammed shut.\n\nThe tiger looked at the Ambassador. The Ambassador looked at the\ntiger.\n\n\"Most ingenious,\" the Ambassador said.\n\nAt the sound of his voice, the tiger came unglued. He sprang like a\nsteel spring uncoiling, landing on the floor where the Ambassador had\nbeen.\n\nThe door opened again. Another tiger was pushed in. He snarled angrily\nand leaped at the first. They smashed together in midair.\n\nThe Ambassador appeared a few feet off, watching. He moved back when a\nlion entered the door, head up and alert. The lion sprang at him,\nalmost going over on his head when he struck nothing. Not finding any\nhuman, the lion leaped on one of the tigers.\n\nThe Ambassador reappeared in his chair, where he sat smoking and\nwatching the beasts kill each other.\n\nIn ten minutes the room looked like an abattoir.\n\nBut by then the Ambassador had tired of the spectacle, and was\nreclining on his bed, reading.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I give up,\" Malley said. \"That was my last bright idea.\"\n\nCercy stared at the floor, not answering. Harrison was seated in the\ncorner, getting quietly drunk.\n\nThe telephone rang.\n\n\"Yeah?\" Cercy said.\n\n\"I've got it!\" Darrig's voice shouted over the line. \"I really think\nthis is it. Look, I'm taking a cab right down. Tell Harrison to find\nsome helpers.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Cercy asked.\n\n\"The chaos underneath!\" Darrig replied, and hung up.\n\nThey paced the floor, waiting for him to show up. Half an hour passed,\nthen an hour. Finally, three hours after he had called, Darrig\nstrolled in.\n\n\"Hello,\" he said casually.\n\n\"Hello, hell!\" Cercy growled. \"What kept you?\"\n\n\"On the way over,\" Darrig said, \"I read the Ambassador's philosophy.\nIt's quite a work.\"\n\n\"Is that what took you so long?\"\n\n\"Yes. I had the driver take me around the park a few times, while I\nwas reading it.\"\n\n\"Skip it. How about--\"\n\n\"I can't skip it,\" Darrig said, in a strange, tight voice. \"I'm afraid\nwe were wrong. About the aliens, I mean. It's perfectly right and\nproper that they should rule us. As a matter of fact, I wish they'd\nhurry up and get here.\"\n\nBut Darrig didn't look certain. His voice shook and perspiration\npoured from his face. He twisted his hands together, as though in\nagony.\n\n\"It's hard to explain,\" he said. \"Everything became clear as soon as I\nstarted reading it. I saw how stupid we were, trying to be\nindependent in this interdependent Universe. I saw--oh, look, Cercy.\nLet's stop all this foolishness and accept the Ambassador as our\nfriend.\"\n\n\"Calm down!\" Cercy shouted at the perfectly calm physicist. \"You don't\nknow what you're saying.\"\n\n\"It's strange,\" Darrig said. \"I know how I felt--I just don't feel\nthat way any more. I think. Anyhow, I know _your_ trouble. You haven't\nread the philosophy. You'll see what I mean, once you've read it.\" He\nhanded Cercy the pile of papers. Cercy promptly ignited them with his\ncigarette lighter.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" Darrig said. \"I've got it memorized. Just listen.\nAxiom one. All peoples--\"\n\nCercy hit him, a short, clean blow, and Darrig slumped to the floor.\n\n\"Those words must be semantically keyed,\" Malley said. \"They're\ndesigned to set off certain reactions in us, I suppose. All the\nAmbassador does is alter the philosophy to suit the peoples he's\ndealing with.\"\n\n\"Look, Malley,\" Cercy said. \"This is your job now. Darrig knows, or\nthought he knew, the answer. You have to get that out of him.\"\n\n\"That won't be easy,\" Malley said. \"He'd feel that he was betraying\neverything he believes in, if he were to tell us.\"\n\n\"I don't care how you get it,\" Cercy said. \"Just get it.\"\n\n\"Even if it kills him?\" Malley asked.\n\n\"Even if it kills you.\"\n\n\"Help me get him to my lab,\" Malley said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night Cercy and Harrison kept watch on the Ambassador from the\ncontrol room. Cercy found his thoughts were racing in circles.\n\nWhat had killed Alfern in space? Could it be duplicated on Earth? What\nwas the regularizing principle? What was the chaos underneath?\n\n_What in hell am I doing here?_ he asked himself. But he couldn't\nstart that sort of thing.\n\n\"What do you figure the Ambassador is?\" he asked Harrison. \"Is he a\nman?\"\n\n\"Looks like one,\" Harrison said drowsily.\n\n\"But he doesn't act like one. I wonder if this is his true shape?\"\n\nHarrison shook his head, and lighted his pipe.\n\n\"What is there of him?\" Cercy asked. \"He looks like a man, but he can\nchange into anything else. You can't attack him; he adapts. He's like\nwater, taking the shape of any vessel he's poured into.\"\n\n\"You can boil water,\" Harrison yawned.\n\n\"Sure. Water hasn't any shape, has it? Or has it? What's basic?\"\n\nWith an effort, Harrison tried to focus on Cercy's words. \"Molecular\npattern? The matrix?\"\n\n\"Matrix,\" Cercy repeated, yawning himself. \"Pattern. Must be something\nlike that. A pattern is abstract, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Sure. A pattern can be impressed on anything. What did I say?\"\n\n\"Let's see,\" Cercy said. \"Pattern. Matrix. Everything about the\nAmbassador is capable of change. There must be some unifying force\nthat retains his personality. Something that _doesn't_ change, no\nmatter what contortions he goes through.\"\n\n\"Like a piece of string,\" Harrison murmured with his eyes closed.\n\n\"Sure. Tie it in knots, weave a rope out of it, wind it around your\nfinger; it's still string.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"But how do you attack a pattern?\" Cercy asked. And why couldn't he\nget some sleep? To hell with the Ambassador and his hordes of\ncolonists, he was going to close his eyes for a moment....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Wake up, Colonel!\"\n\nCercy pried his eyes open and looked up at Malley. Besides him,\nHarrison was snoring deeply. \"Did you get anything?\"\n\n\"Not a thing,\" Malley confessed. \"The philosophy must've had quite an\neffect on him. But it didn't work all the way. Darrig knew that he\n_had wanted_ to kill the Ambassador, and for good and sufficient\nreasons. Although he felt differently now, he still had the feeling\nthat he was betraying us. On the one hand, he couldn't hurt the\nAmbassador; on the other, he wouldn't hurt us.\"\n\n\"Won't he tell anything?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it's not that simple,\" Malley said. \"You know, if you have\nan insurmountable obstacle that _must_ be surmounted ... and also, I\nthink the philosophy had an injurious effect on his mind.\"\n\n\"What are you trying to say?\" Cercy got to his feet.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Malley apologized, \"there wasn't a damned thing I could\ndo. Darrig fought the whole thing out in his mind, and when he\ncouldn't fight any longer, he--retreated. I'm afraid he's hopelessly\ninsane.\"\n\n\"Let's see him.\"\n\nThey walked down the corridor to Malley's laboratory. Darrig was\nrelaxed on a couch, his eyes glazed and staring.\n\n\"Is there any way of curing him?\" Cercy asked.\n\n\"Shock therapy, maybe.\" Malley was dubious. \"It'll take a long time.\nAnd he'll probably block out everything that had to do with producing\nthis.\"\n\nCercy turned away, feeling sick. Even if Darrig could be cured, it\nwould be too late. The aliens must have picked up the Ambassador's\nmessage by now and were undoubtedly heading for Earth.\n\n\"What's this?\" Cercy asked, picking up a piece of paper that lay by\nDarrig's hand.\n\n\"Oh, he was doodling,\" Malley said. \"Is there anything written on it?\"\n\nCercy read aloud: \"'Upon further consideration I can see that Chaos\nand the Gorgon Medusa are closely related.'\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\" Malley asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Cercy puzzled. \"He was always interested in folklore.\"\n\n\"Sounds schizophrenic,\" the psychiatrist said.\n\nCercy read it again. \"'Upon further consideration, I can see that\nChaos and the Gorgon Medusa are closely related.'\" He stared at it.\n\"Isn't it possible,\" he asked Malley, \"that he was trying to give us a\nclue? Trying to trick himself into giving and not giving at the same\ntime?\"\n\n\"It's possible,\" Malley agreed. \"An unsuccessful compromise--But what\ncould it mean?\"\n\n\"Chaos.\" Cercy remembered Darrig's mentioning that word in his\ntelephone call. \"That was the original state of the Universe in Greek\nmyth, wasn't it? The formlessness out of which everything came?\"\n\n\"Something like that,\" Malley said. \"And Medusa was one of those three\nsisters with the horrible faces.\"\n\nCercy stood for a moment, staring at the paper. Chaos ... Medusa ...\nand the organizing principle! Of course!\n\n\"I think--\" He turned and ran from the room. Malley looked at him;\nthen loaded a hypodermic and followed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the control room, Cercy shouted Harrison into consciousness.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said, \"I want you to build something, quick. Do you hear\nme?\"\n\n\"Sure.\" Harrison blinked and sat up. \"What's the rush?\"\n\n\"I know what Darrig wanted to tell us,\" Cercy said. \"Come on, I'll\ntell you what I want. And Malley, put down that hypodermic. I haven't\ncracked. I want you to get me a book on Greek mythology. And hurry it\nup.\"\n\nFinding a Greek mythology isn't an easy task at two o'clock in the\nmorning. With the aid of FBI men, Malley routed a book dealer out of\nbed. He got his book and hurried back.\n\nCercy was red-eyed and excited, and Harrison and his helpers were\nworking away at three crazy looking rigs. Cercy snatched the book from\nMalley, looked up one item, and put it down.\n\n\"Great work,\" he said. \"We're all set now. Finished, Harrison?\"\n\n\"Just about.\" Harrison and ten helpers were screwing in the last\nparts. \"Will you tell me what this is?\"\n\n\"Me too,\" Malley put in.\n\n\"I don't mean to be secretive,\" Cercy said. \"I'm just in a hurry. I'll\nexplain as we go along.\" He stood up. \"Okay, let's wake up the\nAmbassador.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey watched the screen as a bolt of electricity leaped from the\nceiling to the Ambassador's bed. Immediately, the Ambassador vanished.\n\n\"Now he's a part of that stream of electrons, right?\" Cercy asked.\n\n\"That's what he told us,\" Malley said.\n\n\"But still keeping his pattern, within the stream,\" Cercy continued.\n\"He has to, in order to get back into his own shape. Now we start the\nfirst disrupter.\"\n\nHarrison hooked the machine into circuit, and sent his helpers away.\n\n\"Here's a running graph of the electron stream,\" Cercy said. \"See the\ndifference?\" On the graph there was an irregular series of peaks and\nvalleys, constantly shifting and leveling. \"Do you remember when you\nhypnotized the Ambassador? He talked about his friend who'd been\nkilled in space.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Malley nodded. \"His friend had been killed by\nsomething that had just popped up.\"\n\n\"He said something else,\" Cercy went on. \"He told us that the basic\norganizing force of the Universe usually stopped things like that.\nWhat does that mean to you?\"\n\n\"The organizing force,\" Malley repeated slowly. \"Didn't Darrig say\nthat that was a new natural law?\"\n\n\"He did. But think of the implications, as Darrig did. If an\norganizing principle is engaged in some work, there must be something\nthat opposes it. That which opposes organization is--\"\n\n\"Chaos!\"\n\n\"That's what Darrig thought, and what we should have seen. The chaos\nis underlying, and out of it there arose an organizing principle. This\nprinciple, if I've got it right, sought to suppress the fundamental\nchaos, to make all things regular.\n\n\"But the chaos still boils out in spots, as Alfern found out. Perhaps\nthe organizational pattern is weaker in space. Anyhow, those spots are\ndangerous, until the organizing principle gets to work on them.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned to the panel. \"Okay, Harrison. Throw in the second\ndisrupter.\" The peaks and valleys altered on the graph. They started\nto mount in crazy, meaningless configurations.\n\n\"Take Darrig's message in the light of that. Chaos, we know, is\nunderlying. Everything was formed out of it. The Gorgon Medusa was\nsomething that _couldn't be looked upon_. She turned men into stone,\nyou recall, destroyed them. So, Darrig found a relationship between\nchaos and that which can't be looked upon. All with regard to the\nAmbassador, of course.\"\n\n\"The Ambassador can't look upon chaos!\" Malley cried.\n\n\"That's it. The Ambassador is capable of an infinite number of\nalterations and permutations. But _something_--the matrix--can't\nchange, because then there would be nothing left. To destroy something\nas abstract as a pattern, we need a state in which no pattern is\npossible. A state of chaos.\"\n\nThe third disrupter was thrown into circuit. The graph looked as if a\ndrunken caterpillar had been sketching on it.\n\n\"Those disrupters are Harrison's idea,\" Cercy said. \"I told him I\nwanted an electrical current with absolutely no coherent pattern. The\ndisrupters are an extension of radio jamming. The first alters the\nelectrical pattern. That's its purpose: to produce a state of\npatternlessness. The second tries to destroy the pattern left by the\nfirst; the third tries to destroy the pattern made by the first two.\nThey're fed back then, and any remaining pattern is systematically\ndestroyed in circuit ... I hope.\"\n\n\"This is supposed to produce a state of chaos?\" Malley asked, looking\ninto the screen.\n\nFor a while there was only the whining of the machines and the crazy\ndoodling of the graph. Then, in the middle of the Ambassador's room, a\nspot appeared. It wavered, shrunk, expanded--\n\nWhat happened was indescribable. All they knew was that everything\nwithin the spot had disappeared.\n\n\"Switch it off\" Cercy shouted. Harrison cut the switch.\n\nThe spot continued to grow.\n\n\"How is it we're able to look at it?\" Malley asked, staring at the\nscreen.\n\n\"The shield of Perseus, remember?\" Cercy said. \"Using it as a mirror,\nhe could look at Medusa.\"\n\n\"It's still growing!\" Malley shouted.\n\n\"There was a calculated risk in all this,\" Cercy said. \"There's always\nthe possibility that the chaos may go on, unchecked. If that happens,\nit won't matter much what--\"\n\nThe spot stopped growing. Its edges wavered and rippled, and then it\nstarted to shrink.\n\n\"The organizing principle,\" Cercy said, and collapsed into a chair.\n\n\"Any sign of the Ambassador?\" he asked, in a few minutes.\n\nThe spot was still wavering. Then it was gone. Instantly there was an\nexplosion. The steel walls buckled inward, but held. The screen went\ndead.\n\n\"The spot removed all the air from the room,\" Cercy explained, \"as\nwell as the furniture and the Ambassador.\"\n\n\"He couldn't take it,\" Malley said. \"No pattern can cohere, in a state\nof patternlessness. He's gone to join Alfern.\"\n\nMalley started to giggle. Cercy felt like joining him, but pulled\nhimself together.\n\n\"Take it easy,\" he said. \"We're not through yet.\"\n\n\"Sure we are! The Ambassador--\"\n\n\"Is out of the way. But there's still an alien fleet homing in on this\nregion of space. A fleet so strong we couldn't scratch it with an\nH-bomb. They'll be looking for us.\"\n\nHe stood up.\n\n\"Go home and get some sleep. Something tells me that tomorrow we're\ngoing to have to start figuring out some way of camouflaging a\nplanet.\"\n\n                                                     --ROBERT SHECKLEY\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Diplomatic Immunity, by Robert Sheckley\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32040.txt or 32040.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/0/4/32040/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
