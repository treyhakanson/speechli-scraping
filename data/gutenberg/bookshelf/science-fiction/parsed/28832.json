But the leaks in the starboard tanks lost us half our supply,\nand we had used the other half before discovering that. Since the ship's\nrocket-tubes cannot operate without fuel, we are simply drifting. We\nwould drift on to Neptune if the attraction of Uranus were not pulling\nus to the right. That attraction alters our course so that in three\nship-days we shall drift into the dead-area.\"\n\nRance Kent, first-officer of the _Pallas_, asked a question: \"Couldn't\nwe, raise Neptune with the radio, sir, and have them send out a\nfuel-ship in time to reach us?\"\n\n\"It's impossible, Mr. Kent,\" Crain answered. \"Our main radio is dead\nwithout fuel to run its dynamotors, and our auxiliary set hasn't the\npower to reach Neptune.\"\n\n\"Why not abandon ship in the space-suits,\" asked Liggett, the\nsecond-officer, \"and trust to the chance of some ship picking us up?\"\n\nThe captain shook his head. \"It would be quite useless, for we'd simply\ndrift on through space with the ship into the dead-area.\"\n\nThe score of members of the crew, bronzed space-sailors out of every\nport in the solar system, had listened mutely. Now, one of them, a tall\ntube-man, stepped forward a little.\n\n\"Just what is this dead-area, sir?\" he asked. \"I've heard of it, but as\nthis is my first outer-planet voyage, I know nothing about it.\"\n\n\"I'll admit I know little more,\" said Liggett, \"save that a good many\ndisabled ships have drifted into it and have never come out.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"The dead area,\" Crain told them, \"is a region of space ninety thousand\nmiles across within Neptune's orbit, in which the ordinary gravitational\nattractions of the solar system are dead. This is because in that region\nthe pulls of the sun and the outer planets exactly balance each other.\nBecause of that, anything in the dead-area, will stay in there until\ntime ends, unless it has power of its own. Many wrecked space-ships have\ndrifted into it at one time or another, none ever emerging; and it's\nbelieved that there is a great mass of wrecks somewhere in the area,\ndrawn and held together by mutual attraction.\"\n\n\"And we're drifting in to join them,\" Kent said. \"Some prospect!\"\n\n\"Then there's really no chance for us?\" asked Liggett keenly.\n\nCaptain Crain thought. \"As I see it, very little,\" he admitted. \"If our\nauxiliary radio can reach some nearby ship before the _Pallas_ enters\nthe dead-area, we'll have a chance. But it seems a remote one.\"\n\nHe addressed himself to the men: \"I have laid the situation frankly\nbefore you because I consider you entitled to the truth. You must\nremember, however, that while there is life there is hope.\n\n\"There will be no change in ship routine, and the customary watches will\nbe kept. Half-rations of food and water will be the rule from now on,\nthough. That is all.\"\n\nAs the men moved silently off, the captain looked after them with\nsomething of pride.\n\n\"They're taking it like men,\" he told Kent and Liggett. \"It's a pity\nthere's no way out for them and us.\"\n\n\"If the _Pallas_ does enter the dead-area and join the wreck-pack,\"\nLiggett said, \"how long will we be able to live?\"\n\n\"Probably for some months on our present condensed air and food\nsupplies,\" Crain answered. \"I would prefer, myself, a quicker end.\"\n\n\"So would I,\" said Kent. \"Well, there's nothing left but to pray for\nsome kind of ship to cross our path in the next day or two.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nKent's prayers were not answered in the next ship-day, nor in the next.\nFor, though one of the _Pallas'_ radio-operators was constantly at the\ninstruments under Captain Crain's orders, the weak calls of the\nauxiliary set raised no response.\n\nHad they been on the Venus or Mars run, Kent told himself, there would\nbe some chance, but out here in the vast spaces, between the outer\nplanets, ships were fewer and farther between. The big, cigar-shaped\nfreighter drifted helplessly on in a broad curve toward the dreaded\narea, the green light-speck of Neptune swinging to their left.\n\nOn the third ship-day Kent and Captain Crain stood in the pilot-house\nbehind Liggett, who sat at the now useless rocket-tube controls. Their\neyes were on the big glass screen of the gravograph. The black dot on it\nthat represented their ship was crawling steadily toward the bright red\ncircle that stood for the dead-area....\n\nThey watched silently until the dot had crawled over the circle's red\nline, heading toward its center.\n\n\"Well, we're in at last,\" Kent commented. \"There seems to be no change\nin anything, either.\"\n\nCrain pointed to the instrument-panel. \"Look at the gravitometers.\"\n\nKent did. \"All dead! No gravitational pull from any direction--no, that\none shows a slight attraction from ahead!\"\n\n\"Then gravitational attraction of some sort does exist in the dead-area\nafter all!\" Liggett exclaimed.\n\n\"You don't understand,\" said Crain. \"That attraction from ahead is the\npull of the wreck-pack at the dead-area's center.\"\n\n\"And it's pulling the _Pallas_ toward it?\" Kent exclaimed.\n\nCrain nodded. \"We'll probably reach the wreck-pack in two more\nship-days.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThe next two ship-days seemed to Kent drawn out endlessly. A moody\nsilence had grown upon the officers and men of the ship. All seemed\noppressed by the strange forces of fate that had seized the ship and\nwere carrying it, smoothly and soundlessly, into this region of\nirrevocable doom.\n\nThe radio-operators' vain calls had ceased. The _Pallas_ drifted on into\nthe dreaded area like some dumb ship laden with damned souls. It drifted\non, Kent told himself, as many a wrecked and disabled ship had done\nbefore it, with the ordinary activities and life of the solar system\nforever behind it, and mystery and death ahead.\n\nIt was toward the end of the second of those two ship-days that\nLiggett's voice came down from the pilot-house:\n\n\"Wreck-pack in sight ahead!\"\n\n\"We've arrived, anyway!\" Kent cried, as he and Crain hastened up into\nthe pilot house. The crew was running to the deck-windows.\n\n\"Right ahead there, about fifteen degrees left,\" Liggett told Kent and\nCrain, pointing. \"Do you see it?\"\n\nKent stared; nodded. The wreck-pack was a distant, disk-like mass\nagainst the star-flecked heavens, a mass that glinted here and there in\nthe feeble sunlight of space. It did not seem large, but, as they\ndrifted steadily closer in the next hours, they saw that in reality the\nwreck-pack was tremendous, measuring at least fifty miles across.\n\nIts huge mass was a heterogeneous heap, composed mostly of countless\ncigar-like space-ships in all stages of wreckage. Some appeared smashed\nalmost out of all recognizable shape, while others were, to all\nappearances unharmed. They floated together in this dense mass in space,\ncrowded against one another by their mutual attraction.\n\nThere seemed to be among them every type of ship known in the solar\nsystem, from small, swift mail-boats to big freighters. And, as they\ndrifted nearer, the three in the pilot-house could see that around and\nbetween the ships of the wreck-pack floated much other matter--fragments\nof wreckage, meteors, small and large, and space-debris of every sort.\n\nThe _Pallas_ was drifting, not straight toward the wreck-pack, but in a\ncourse that promised to take the ship past it.\n\n\"We're not heading into the wreck-pack!\" Liggett exclaimed. \"Maybe we'll\ndrift past it, and on out the dead-area's other side!\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nCaptain Crain smiled mirthlessly. \"You're forgetting your\nspace-mechanics, Liggett. We will drift along the wreck-pack's edge, and\nthen will curve in and go round it in a closing spiral until we reach\nits edge.\"\n\n\"Lord, who'd have thought there were so many wrecks here!\" Kent\nmarvelled. \"There must be thousands of them!\"\n\n\"They've been collecting here ever since the first interplanetary\nrocket-ships went forth,\" Crain reminded him. \"Not only meteor-wrecked\nships, but ships whose mechanisms went wrong--or that ran out of fuel\nlike ours--or that were captured and sacked, and then set adrift by\nspace-pirates.\"\n\nThe _Pallas_ by then was drifting along the wreck-pack's rim at a\nhalf-mile distance, and Kent's eyes were running over the mass.\n\n\"Some of those ships look entirely undamaged. Why couldn't we find one\nthat has fuel in its tanks, transfer it to our own tanks, and get away?\"\nhe asked.\n\nCrain's eyes lit. \"Kent, that's a real chance! There must be some ships\nin that pack with fuel in them, and we can use the space-suits to\nexplore for them!\"\n\n\"Look, we're beginning to curve in around the pack now!\" Liggett\nexclaimed.\n\nThe _Pallas_, as though loath to pass the wreck-pack, was curving\ninward to follow its rim. In the next hours it continued to sail slowly\naround the great pack, approaching closer and closer to its edge.\n\nIn those hours Kent and Crain and all in the ship watched with a\nfascinated interest that even knowledge of their own peril could not\nkill. They could see swift-lined passenger-ships of the Pluto and\nNeptune runs shouldering against small space-yachts with the insignia of\nMars or Venus on their bows. Wrecked freighters from Saturn or Earth\nfloated beside rotund grain-boats from Jupiter.\n\nThe debris among the pack's wrecks was just as varied, holding fragments\nof metal, dark meteors of differing size--and many human bodies. Among\nthese were some clad in the insulated space-suits, with their\ntransparent glassite helmets. Kent wondered what wreck they had\nabandoned hastily in those suits, only to be swept with it into the\ndead-area, to die in their suits.\n\nBy the end of that ship-day, the _Pallas_, having floated almost\ncompletely around the wreck-pack, finally struck the wrecks at its edge\nwith a jarring shock; then bobbed for a while and lay still. From\npilot-house and deck windows the men looked eagerly forth.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nTheir ship floated at the wreck-pack's edge. Directly to its right\nfloated a sleek, shining Uranus-Jupiter passenger-ship whose bows had\nbeen smashed in by a meteor. On their left bobbed an unmarked freighter\nof the old type with projecting rocket-tubes, apparently intact. Beyond\nthem in the wreck-pack lay another Uranus craft, a freighter, and,\nbeyond it, stretched the countless other wrecks.\n\nCaptain Crain summoned the crew together again on the middle-deck.\n\n\"Men, we've reached the wreck-pack at the dead-area's center, and here\nwe'll stay until the end of time unless we get out under our own power.\nMr. Kent has suggested a possible way of doing so, which I consider\nhighly feasible.\n\n\"He has suggested that in some of the ships in the wreck-pack may be\nfound enough fuel to enable us to escape from the dead-area, once it is\ntransferred to this ship. I am going to permit him to explore the\nwreck-pack with a party in space suits, and I am asking for volunteers\nfor this service.\"\n\nThe entire crew stepped quickly forward. Crain smiled. \"Twelve of you\nwill be enough,\" he told them. \"The eight tube-men and four of the\ncargo-men will go, therefore, with Mr. Kent and Mr. Liggett as leaders.\nMr. Kent, you may address the men if you wish.\"\n\n\"Get down to the lower airlock and into your space-suits at once, then,\"\nKent told them. \"Mr. Liggett, will you supervise that?\"\n\nAs Liggett and the men trooped down to the airlock, Kent turned back\ntoward his superior.\n\n\"There's a very real chance of your becoming lost in this huge\nwreck-pack, Kent,\" Crain told him: \"so be very careful to keep your\nbearings at all times. I know I can depend on you.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best,\" Kent was saying, when Liggett's excited face\nreappeared suddenly at the stair.\n\n\"There are men coming toward the _Pallas_ along the wreck-pack's edge!\"\nhe reported--\"a half-dozen men in space-suits!\"\n\n\"You must be mistaken, Liggett!\" exclaimed Crain. \"They must be some of\nthe bodies in space-suits we saw in the pack.\"\n\n\"No, they're living men!\" Liggett cried. \"They're coming straight toward\nus--come down and see!\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nCrain and Kent followed Liggett quickly down to the airlock room, where\nthe men who had started donning their space-suits were now peering\nexcitedly from the windows. Crain and Kent looked where Liggett pointed,\nalong the wreck-pack's edge to the ship's right.\n\nSix floating shapes, men in space-suits, were approaching along the\npack's border. They floated smoothly through space, reaching the wrecked\npassenger-ship beside the _Pallas_. They braced their feet against its\nside and propelled themselves on through the void like swimmers under\nwater, toward the _Pallas_.\n\n\"They must be survivors from some wreck that drifted in here as we did!\"\nKent exclaimed. \"Maybe they've lived here for months!\"\n\n\"It's evident that they saw the _Pallas_ drift into the pack, and have\ncome to investigate,\" Crain estimated. \"Open the airlock for them, men,\nfor they'll want to come inside.\"\n\nTwo of the men spun the wheels that slid aside the airlock's outer door.\nIn a moment the half-dozen men outside had reached the ship's side, and\nhad pulled themselves down inside the airlock.\n\nWhen all were in, the outer door was closed, and air hissed in to fill\nthe lock. The airlock's inner door then slid open and the newcomers\nstepped into the ship's interior, unscrewing their transparent helmets\nas they did so. For a few moments the visitors silently surveyed their\nnew surroundings.\n\nTheir leader was a swarthy individual with sardonic black eyes who, on\nnoticing Crain's captain-insignia, came toward him with outstretched\nhand. His followers seemed to be cargo-men or deck-men, looking hardly\nintelligent enough to Kent's eyes to be tube-men.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"Welcome to our city!\" their leader exclaimed as he shook Crain's hand.\n\"We saw your ship drift in, but hardly expected to find anyone living in\nit.\"\n\n\"I'll confess that we're surprised ourselves to find any life here,\"\nCrain told him. \"You're living on one of the wrecks?\"\n\nThe other nodded. \"Yes, on the _Martian Queen_, a quarter-mile along the\npack's edge. It was a Saturn-Neptune passenger ship, and about a month\nago we were at this cursed dead-area's edge, when half our rocket-tubes\nexploded. Eighteen of us escaped the explosion, the ship's walls still\nbeing tight; and we drifted into the pack here, and have been living\nhere ever since.\"\n\n\"My name's Krell,\" he added, \"and I was a tube-man on the ship. I and\nanother of the tube-men, named Jandron, were the highest in rank left,\nall the officers and other tube-men having been killed, so we took\ncharge and have been keeping order.\"\n\n\"What about your passengers?\" Liggett asked.\n\n\"All killed but one,\" Krell answered. \"When the tubes let go they\nsmashed up the whole lower two decks.\"\n\nCrain briefly explained to him the _Pallas'_ predicament. \"Mr. Kent and\nMr. Liggett were on the point of starting a search of the wreck-pack for\nfuel when you arrived,\" he said, \"With enough fuel we can get clear of\nthe dead-area.\"\n\nKrell's eyes lit up. \"That would mean a getaway for all of us! It surely\nought to be possible!\"\n\n\"Do you know whether there are any ships in the pack with fuel in their\ntanks?\" Kent asked. Krell shook his head.\n\n\"We've searched through the wreck-pack a good bit, but never bothered\nabout fuel, it being no good to us. But there ought to be some, at\nleast: there's enough wrecks in this cursed place to make it possible\nto find almost anything.\n\n\"You'd better not start exploring, though,\" he added, \"without some of\nus along as guides, for I'm here to tell you that you can lose yourself\nin this wreck-pack without knowing it. If you wait until to-morrow, I'll\ncome over myself and go with you.\"\n\n\"I think that would be wise,\" Crain said to Kent. \"There is plenty of\ntime.\"\n\n\"Time is the one thing there's plenty of in this damned place,\" Krell\nagreed. \"We'll be getting back to the _Martian Queen_ now and give the\ngood news to Jandron and the rest.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't mind if Liggett and I came along, would you?\" Kent asked. \"I'd\nlike to see how your ship's fixed--that is, if it's all right with you,\nsir,\" he added to his superior.\n\nCrain nodded. \"All right if you don't stay long,\" he said. But, to\nKent's surprise Krell seemed reluctant to endorse his proposal.\n\n\"I guess it'll be all right,\" he said slowly, \"though there's nothing\nmuch on the _Martian Queen_ to see.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nKrell and his followers replaced their helmets and returned into the\nairlock. Liggett followed them, and, as Kent struggled hastily into a\nspace-suit, he found Captain Crain at his side.\n\n\"Kent, look sharp when you get over on that ship,\" Crain told him. \"I\ndon't like the look of this Krell, and his story about all the officers\nbeing killed in the explosion sounds fishy to me.\"\n\n\"To me, too,\" Kent agreed. \"But Liggett and I will have the suit-phones\nin our space-suits and can call you from there in case of need.\"\n\nCrain nodded, and Kent with space-suit on and transparent helmet\nscrewed tight, stepped into the airlock with the rest. The airlock's\ninner door closed, the outer one opened, and as the air puffed out into\nspace, Kent and Krell and Liggett leapt out into the void, the others\nfollowing.\n\nIt was no novelty to Kent to float in a space-suit in the empty void. He\nand the others now floated as smoothly as though under water toward a\nwrecked liner at the _Pallas'_ right. They reached it, pulled themselves\naround it, and, with feet braced against its side, propelled themselves\non through space along the border of the wreck-pack.\n\nThey passed a half-dozen wrecks thus, before coming to the _Martian\nQueen_. It was a silvery, glistening ship whose stern and lower walls\nwere bulging and strained, but not cracked. Kent told himself that Krell\nhad spoken truth about the exploding rocket-tubes, at least.\n\nThey struck the _Martian Queen's_ side and entered the upper-airlock\nopen for them. Once through the airlock they found themselves on the\nship's upper-deck. And when Kent and Liggett removed their helmets with\nthe others they found a full dozen men confronting them, a brutal-faced\ngroup who exhibited some surprise at sight of them.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nForemost among them stood a tall, heavy individual who regarded Kent and\nLiggett with the cold, suspicious eyes of an animal.\n\n\"My comrade and fellow-ruler here, Wald Jandron,\" said Krell. To Jandron\nhe explained rapidly. \"The whole crew of the _Pallas_ is alive, and they\nsay if they can find fuel in the wreck-pack their ship can get out of\nhere.\"\n\n\"Good,\" grunted Jandron. \"The sooner they can do it, the better it will\nbe for us.\"\n\nKent saw Liggett flush angrily, but he ignored Jandron and spoke to\nKrell. \"You said one of your passengers had escaped the explosion?\"\n\nTo Kent's amazement a girl stepped from behind the group of men, a slim\ngirl with pale face and steady, dark eyes. \"I'm the passenger,\" she told\nhim. \"My name's Marta Mallen.\"\n\nKent and Liggett stared, astounded. \"Good Lord!\" Kent exclaimed. \"A girl\nlike you on this ship!\"\n\n\"Miss Mallen happened to be on the upper-deck at the time of the\nexplosion and, so, escaped when the other passengers were killed,\" Krell\nexplained smoothly. \"Isn't that so, Miss Mallen?\"\n\nThe girl's eyes had not left Kent's, but at Krell's words she nodded.\n\"Yes, that is so,\" she said mechanically.\n\nKent collected his whirling thoughts. \"But wouldn't you rather go back\nto the _Pallas_ with us?\" he asked. \"I'm sure you'd be more comfortable\nthere.\"\n\n\"She doesn't go,\" grunted Jandron. Kent turned in quick wrath toward\nhim, but Krell intervened.\n\n\"Jandron only means that Miss Mallen is much more comfortable on this\npassenger-ship than she'd be in your freighter.\" He shot a glance at the\ngirl as he spoke, and Kent saw her wince.\n\n\"I'm afraid that's so,\" she said; \"but I thank you for the offer, Mr.\nKent.\"\n\nKent could have sworn that there was an appeal in her eyes, and he stood\nfor a moment, indecisive, Jandron's stare upon him. After a moment's\nthought he turned to Krell.\n\n\"You were going to show me the damage the exploding tubes did,\" he said,\nand Krell nodded quickly.\n\n\"Of course; you can see from the head of the stair back in the\nafter-deck.\"\n\nHe led the way along a corridor, Jandron and the girl and two of the\nmen coming with them. Kent's thoughts were still chaotic as he walked\nbetween Krell and Liggett. What was this girl doing amid the men of the\n_Martian Queen_? What had her eyes tried to tell him?\n\nLiggett nudged his side in the dim corridor, and Kent, looking down, saw\ndark splotches on its metal floor. Blood-stains! His suspicions\nstrengthened. They might be from the bleeding of those wounded in the\ntube-explosions. But were they?\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThey reached the after-deck whose stair's head gave a view of the\nwrecked tube-rooms beneath. The lower decks had been smashed by terrific\nforces. Kent's practiced eyes ran rapidly over the shattered\nrocket-tubes.\n\n\"They've back-blasted from being fired too fast,\" he said. \"Who was\ncontrolling the ship when this happened?\"\n\n\"Galling, our second-officer,\" answered Krell. \"He had found us routed\ntoo close to the dead-area's edge and was trying to get away from it in\na hurry, when he used the tubes too fast, and half of them\nback-blasted.\"\n\n\"If Galling was at the controls in the pilot-house, how did the\nexplosion kill him?\" asked Liggett skeptically. Krell turned quickly.\n\n\"The shock threw him against the pilot-house wall and fractured his\nskull--he died in an hour,\" he said. Liggett was silent.\n\n\"Well, this ship will never move again,\" Kent said. \"It's too bad that\nthe explosion blew out your tanks, but we ought to find fuel somewhere\nin the wreck-pack for the _Pallas_. And now we'd best get back.\"\n\nAs they returned up the dim corridor Kent managed to walk beside Marta\nMallen, and, without being seen, he contrived to detach his\nsuit-phone--the compact little radiophone case inside his space-suit's\nneck--and slip it into the girl's grasp. He dared utter no word of\nexplanation, but apparently she understood, for she had concealed the\nsuit-phone by the time they reached the upper-deck.\n\nKent and Liggett prepared to don their space-helmets, and before\nentering the airlock, Kent turned to Krell.\n\n\"We'll expect you at the _Pallas_ first hour to-morrow, and we'll start\nsearching the wreck-pack with a dozen of our men,\" he said.\n\nHe then extended his hand to the girl. \"Good-by, Miss Mallen. I hope we\ncan have a talk soon.\"\n\nHe had said the words with double meaning, and saw understanding in her\neyes. \"I hope we can, too,\" she said.\n\nKent's nod to Jandron went unanswered, and he and Liggett adjusted their\nhelmets and entered the airlock.\n\nOnce out of it, they kicked rapidly away from the _Martian Queen_,\nfloating along with the wreck-pack's huge mass to their right, and only\nthe star-flecked emptiness of infinity to their left. In a few minutes\nthey reached the airlock of the _Pallas_.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThey found Captain Crain awaiting them anxiously. Briefly Kent reported\neverything.\n\n\"I'm certain there has been foul play aboard the _Martian Queen_,\" he\nsaid. \"Krell you saw for yourself, Jandron is pure brute, and their men\nseem capable of anything.\n\n\"I gave the suit-phone to the girl, however, and if she can call us with\nit, we can get the truth from her. She dared not tell me anything there\nin the presence of Krell and Jandron.\"\n\nCrain nodded, his face grave. \"We'll see whether or not she calls,\" he\nsaid.\n\nKent took a suit-phone from one of their space-suits and rapidly, tuned\nit to match the one he had left with Marta Mallen. Almost at once they\nheard her voice from it, and Kent answered rapidly.\n\n\"I'm so glad I got you!\" she exclaimed. \"Mr. Kent, I dared not tell you\nthe truth about this ship when you were here, or Krell and the rest\nwould have killed you at once.\"\n\n\"I thought that was it, and that's why I left the suit-phone for you,\"\nKent said. \"Just what is the truth?\"\n\n\"Krell and Jandron and these men of theirs are the ones who killed the\nofficers and passengers of the _Martian Queen_! What they told you about\nthe explosion was true enough, for the explosion did happen that way,\nand because of it, the ship drifted into the dead-area. But the only\nones killed by it were some of the tube-men and three passengers.\n\n\"Then, while the ship was drifting into the dead-area, Krell told the\nmen that the fewer aboard, the longer they could live on the ship's food\nand air. Krell and Jandron led the men in a surprise attack and killed\nall the officers and passengers, and threw their bodies out into space.\nI was the only passenger they spared, because both Krell and\nJandron--want me!\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThere was a silence, and Kent felt a red anger rising in him. \"Have they\ndared harm you?\" he asked after a moment.\n\n\"No, for Krell and Jandron are too jealous of each other to permit the\nother to touch me. But it's been terrible living with them in this awful\nplace.\"\n\n\"Ask her if she knows what their plans are in regard to us,\" Crain told\nKent.\n\nMarta had apparently overheard the question. \"I don't know that, for\nthey shut me in my cabin as soon as you left,\" she said. \"I've heard\nthem talking and arguing excitedly, though. I know that if you do find\nfuel, they'll try to kill you all and escape from here in your ship.\"\n\n\"Pleasant prospect,\" Kent commented. \"Do you think they plan an attack\non us now?\"\n\n\"No; I think that they'll wait until you've refueled your ship, if you\nare able to do that, and then try treachery.\"\n\n\"Well, they'll find us ready. Miss Mallen, you have the suit-phone: keep\nit hidden in your cabin and I'll call you first thing to-morrow. We're\ngoing to get you out of there, but we don't want to break with Krell\nuntil we're ready. Will you be all right until then?\"\n\n\"Of course I will,\" she answered. \"There's another thing, though. My\nname isn't Miss Mallen--it's Marta.\"\n\n\"Mine's Rance,\" said Kent, smiling. \"Good-by until to-morrow, then,\nMarta.\"\n\n\"Good-by, Rance.\"\n\nKent rose from the instrument with the smile still in his eyes, but with\nhis lips compressed. \"Damn it, there's the bravest and finest girl in\nthe solar system!\" he exclaimed. \"Over there with those brutes!\"\n\n\"We'll have her out, never fear,\" Crain reassured him. \"The main thing\nis to determine our course toward Krell and Jandron.\"\n\nKent thought. \"As I see it, Krell can help us immeasurably in our search\nthrough the wreck-pack for fuel,\" he said. \"I think it would be best to\nkeep on good terms with him until we've found fuel and have it in our\ntanks. Then we can turn the tables on them before they can do anything.\"\n\nCrain nodded thoughtfully. \"I think you're right. Then you and Liggett\nand Krell can head our search-party to-morrow.\"\n\nCrain established watches on a new schedule, and Kent and Liggett and\nthe dozen men chosen for the exploring party of the next day ate a\nscanty meal and turned in for some sleep.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nWhen Kent woke and glimpsed the massed wrecks through the window he was\nfor the moment amazed, but rapidly remembered. He and Liggett were\nfinishing their morning ration when Crain pointed to a window.\n\n\"There comes Krell now,\" he said, indicating the single space-suited\nfigure approaching along the wreck-pack's edge.\n\n\"I'll call Marta before he gets here,\" said Kent hastily.\n\nThe girl answered on the suit-phone immediately, and it occurred to Kent\nthat she must have spent the night without sleeping. \"Krell left a few\nminutes ago,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, he's coming now. You heard nothing of their plans?\"\n\n\"No; they've kept me shut in my cabin. However, I did hear Krell giving\nJandron and the rest directions. I'm sure they're plotting something.\"\n\n\"We're prepared for them,\" Kent assured her. \"If all goes well, before\nyou realize it, you'll be sailing out of here with us in the _Pallas_.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" she said. \"Rance, be careful with Krell in the wreck-pack.\nHe's dangerous.\"\n\n\"I'll be watching him,\" he promised. \"Good-by, Marta.\"\n\nKent reached the lower-deck just as Krell entered from the airlock, his\nswarthy face smiling as he removed his helmet. He carried a pointed\nsteel bar. Liggett and the others were donning their suits.\n\n\"All ready to go, Kent?\" Krell asked.\n\nKent nodded. \"All ready,\" he said shortly. Since hearing Marta's story\nhe found it hard to dissimulate with Krell.\n\n\"You'll want bars like mine,\" Krell continued, \"for they're damned\nhandy when you get jammed between wreckage masses. Exploring this\nwreck-pack is no soft job: I can tell you from experience.\"\n\nLiggett and the rest had their suits adjusted, and with bars in their\ngrasp, followed Krell into the airlock. Kent hung back for a last word\nwith Crain, who, with his half-dozen remaining men, was watching.\n\n\"Marta just told me that Krell and Jandron have been plotting\nsomething,\" he told the captain; \"so I'd keep a close watch outside.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Kent. We'll let no one inside the _Pallas_ until you and\nLiggett and the men get back.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nIn a few minutes they were out of the ship, with Krell and Kent and\nLiggett leading, and the twelve members of the _Pallas'_ crew following\nclosely.\n\nThe three leaders climbed up on the Uranus-Jupiter passenger-ship that\nlay beside the _Pallas_, the others moving on and exploring the\nneighboring wrecks in parties of two and three. From the top of the\npassenger-ship, when they gained it, Kent and his two companions could\nlook far out over the wreck-pack. It was an extraordinary spectacle,\nthis stupendous mass of dead ships floating motionless in the depths of\nspace, with the burning stars above and below them.\n\nHis companions and the other men clambering over the neighboring wrecks\nseemed weird figures in their bulky suits and transparent helmets. Kent\nlooked back at the _Pallas_, and then along the wreck-pack's edge to\nwhere he could glimpse the silvery side of the _Martian Queen_. But now\nKrell and Liggett were descending into the ship's interior through the\ngreat opening smashed in its bows, and Kent followed.\n\nThey found themselves in the liner's upper navigation-rooms. Officers\nand men lay about, frozen to death at the instant the meteor-struck\nvessel's air had rushed out, and the cold of space had entered. Krell\nled the way on, down into the ship's lower decks, where they found the\nbodies of the crew and passengers lying in the same silent death.\n\nThe salons held beautifully-dressed women, distinguished-looking men,\nlying about as the meteor's shock had hurled them. One group lay around\na card-table, their game interrupted. A woman still held a small child,\nboth seemingly asleep. Kent tried to shake off the oppression he felt as\nhe and Krell and Liggett continued down to the tank-rooms.\n\nThey found their quest there useless, for the tanks had been strained by\nthe meteor's shock, and were empty. Kent felt Liggett grasp his hand and\nheard him speak, the sound-vibrations coming through their contacting\nsuits.\n\n\"Nothing here; and we'll find it much the same through all these wrecks,\nif I'm not wrong. Tanks always give at a shock.\"\n\n\"There must be some ships with fuel still in them among all these,\" Kent\nanswered.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThey climbed back, up to the ship's top, and leapt off it toward a\nJupiter freighter lying a little farther inside the pack. As they\nfloated toward it, Kent saw their men moving on with them from ship to\nship, progressing inward into the pack. Both Kent and Liggett kept Krell\nalways ahead of them, knowing that a blow from his bar, shattering their\nglassite helmets, meant instant death. But Krell seemed quite intent on\nthe search for fuel.\n\nThe big Jupiter freighter seemed intact from above, but, when they\npenetrated into it, they found its whole under-side blown away,\napparently by an explosion of its tanks. They moved on to the next ship,\na private space-yacht, small in size, but luxurious in fittings. It had\nbeen abandoned in space, its rocket-tubes burst and tanks strained.\n\nThey went on, working deeper into the wreck-pack. Kent almost forgot the\nparamount importance of their search in the fascination of it. They\nexplored almost every known type of ship--freighters, liners,\ncold-storage boats, and grain-boats. Once Kent's hopes ran high at sight\nof a fuel-ship, but it proved to be in ballast, its cargo-tanks empty\nand its own tanks and tubes apparently blown simultaneously.\n\nKent's muscles ached from the arduous work of climbing over and\nexploring the wrecks. He and Liggett had become accustomed to the sight\nof frozen, motionless bodies.\n\nAs they worked deeper into the pack, they noticed that the ships were of\nincreasingly older types, and at last Krell signalled a halt. \"We're\nalmost a mile in,\" he told them, gripping their hands. \"We'd better work\nback out, taking a different section of the pack as we do.\"\n\nKent nodded. \"It may change our luck,\" he said.\n\nIt did; for when they had gone not more than a half-mile back, they\nglimpsed one of their men waving excitedly from the top of a Pluto\nliner.\n\nThey hastened at once toward him, the other men gathering also; and when\nKent grasped the man's hand he heard his excited voice.\n\n\"Fuel-tanks here are more than half-full, sir!\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThey descended quickly into the liner, finding that though its whole\nstern had been sheared away by a meteor, its tanks had remained\nmiraculously unstrained.\n\n\"Enough fuel here to take the _Pallas_ to Neptune!\" Kent exclaimed.\n\n\"How will you get it over to your ship?\" Krell asked. Kent pointed to\ngreat reels of flexible metal tubing hanging near the tanks.\n\n\"We'll pump it over. The _Pallas_ has tubing like this ship's, for\ntaking on fuel in space, and, by joining its tubing to this, we'll have\na tube-line between the two ships. It's hardly more than a\nquarter-mile.\"\n\n\"Let's get back and let them know about it,\" Liggett urged, and they\nclimbed back out of the liner.\n\nThey worked their way out of the wreck-pack with much greater speed than\nthat with which they had entered, needing only an occasional brace\nagainst a ship's side to send them floating over the wrecks. They came\nto the wreck-pack's edge at a little distance from the _Pallas_, and\nhastened toward it.\n\nThey found the outer door of the _Pallas'_ airlock open, and entered,\nKrell remaining with them. As the outer door closed and air hissed into\nthe lock, Kent and the rest removed their helmets. The inner door slid\nopen as they were doing this, and from inside almost a score of men\nleapt upon them!\n\nKent, stunned for a moment, saw Jandron among their attackers, bellowing\norders to them, and even as he struck out furiously he comprehended.\nJandron and the men of the _Martian Queen_ had somehow captured the\n_Pallas_ from Crain and had been awaiting their return!\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThe struggle was almost instantly over, for, outnumbered and hampered as\nthey were by their heavy space-suits, Kent and Liggett and their\nfollowers had no chance. Their hands, still in the suits, were bound\nquickly behind them at Jandron's orders.\n\nKent heard an exclamation, and saw Marta starting toward him from\nbehind Jandron's men. But a sweep of Jandron's arm brushed her rudely\nback. Kent strained madly at his bonds. Krell's face had a triumphant\nlook.\n\n\"Did it all work as I told you it would, Jandron?\" he asked.\n\n\"It worked,\" Jandron answered impassively. \"When they saw fifteen of us\ncoming from the wreck-pack in space-suits, they opened right up to us.\"\n\nKent understood, and cursed Krell's cunning. Crain, seeing the fifteen\nfigures approaching from the wreck-pack, had naturally thought they were\nKent's party, and had let them enter to overwhelm his half-dozen men.\n\n\"We put Crain and his men over in the _Martian Queen_,\" Jandron\ncontinued, \"and took all their helmets so they can't escape. The girl we\nbrought over here. Did you find a wreck with fuel?\"\n\nKrell nodded. \"A Pluto liner a quarter-mile back, and we can pump the\nfuel over here by connecting tube-lines. What the devil--\"\n\nJandron had made a signal at which three of his men had leapt forward on\nKrell, securing his hands like those of the others.\n\n\"Have you gone crazy, Jandron?\" cried Krell, his face red with anger and\nsurprise.\n\n\"No,\" Jandron replied impassively; \"but the men are as tired as I am of\nyour bossing ways, and have chosen me as their sole leader.\"\n\n\"You dirty double-crosser!\" Krell raged. \"Are you men going to let him\nget away with this?\"\n\nThe men paid no attention, and Jandron motioned to the airlock. \"Take\nthem over to the _Martian Queen_ too,\" he ordered, \"and make sure\nthere's no space-helmet left there. Then get back at once, for we've got\nto get the fuel into this ship and make a getaway.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThe helmets of Kent and Krell and the other helpless prisoners were put\nupon them, and, with hands still bound, they were herded into the\nairlock by eight of Jandron's men attired in space-suits also. The\nprisoners were then joined one to another by a strand of metal cable.\n\nKent, glancing back into the ship as the airlock's inner door closed,\nsaw Jandron giving rapid orders to his followers, and noticed Marta held\nback from the airlock by one of them. Krell's eyes glittered venomously\nthrough his helmet. The outer door opened, and their guards jerked them\nforth into space by the connecting cable.\n\nThey were towed helplessly along the wreck-pack's rim toward the\n_Martian Queen_. Once inside its airlock, Jandron's men removed the\nprisoners' space-helmets and then used the duplicate-control inside the\nairlock itself to open the inner door. Through this opening they thrust\nthe captives, those inside the ship not daring to enter the airlock.\nJandron's men then closed the inner door, re-opened the outer one, and\nstarted back toward the _Pallas_ with the helmets of Kent and his\ncompanions.\n\nKent and the others soon found Crain and his half-dozen men who rapidly\nundid their bonds. Crain's men still wore their space-suits, but, like\nKent's companions, were without space-helmets.\n\n\"Kent, I was afraid they'd get you and your men too!\" Crain exclaimed.\n\"It's all my fault, for when I saw Jandron and his men coming from the\nwreck-pack I never doubted but that it was you.\"\n\n\"It's no one's fault,\" Kent told him. \"It's just something that we\ncouldn't foresee.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nCrain's eyes fell on Krell. \"But what's he doing here?\" he exclaimed.\nKent briefly explained Jandron's treachery toward Krell, and Crain's\nbrows drew ominously together.\n\n\"So Jandron put you here with us! Krell, I am a commissioned captain of\na space-ship, and as such can legally try you and sentence you to death\nhere without further formalities.\"\n\nKrell did not answer, but Kent intervened. \"There's hardly time for that\nnow, sir,\" he said. \"I'm as anxious to settle with Krell as anyone, but\nright now our main enemy is Jandron, and Krell hates Jandron worse than\nwe do, if I'm not mistaken.\"\n\n\"You're not,\" said Krell grimly. \"All I want right now is to get within\nreach of Jandron.\"\n\n\"There's small chance of any of us doing that,\" Crain told them.\n\"There's not a single space-helmet on the _Martian Queen_.\"\n\n\"You've searched?\" Liggett asked.\n\n\"Every cubic inch of the ship,\" Crain told him. \"No, Jandron's men made\nsure there were no helmets left here, and without helmets this ship is\nan inescapable prison.\"\n\n\"Damn it, there must be some way out!\" Kent exclaimed. \"Why, Jandron and\nhis men must be starting to pump that fuel into the _Pallas_ by now!\nThey'll be sailing off as soon as they do it!\"\n\nCrain's face was sad. \"I'm afraid this is the end, Kent. Without\nhelmets, the space between the _Martian Queen_ and the _Pallas_ is a\ngreater barrier to us than a mile-thick wall of steel. In this ship\nwe'll stay, until the air and food give out, and death releases us.\"\n\n\"Damn it, I'm not thinking of myself!\" Kent cried. \"I'm thinking of\nMarta! The _Pallas_ will sail out of here with her in Jandron's power!\"\n\n\"The girl!\" Liggett exclaimed. \"If she could bring us over space-helmets\nfrom the _Pallas_ we could get out of here!\"\n\nKent was thoughtful. \"If we could talk to her--she must still have that\nsuit-phone I gave her. Where's another?\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nCrain quickly detached the compact suit-phone from inside the neck of\nhis own space-suit, and Kent rapidly tuned it to the one he had given\nMarta Mallen. His heart leapt as her voice came instantly from it:\n\n\"Rance! Rance Kent--\"\n\n\"Marta--this is Rance!\" he cried.\n\nHe heard a sob of relief. \"I've been calling you for minutes! I was\nhoping that you'd remember to listen!\n\n\"Jandron and ten of the others have gone to that wreck in which you\nfound the fuel,\" she added swiftly. \"They unreeled a tube-line behind\nthem as they went, and I can hear them pumping in the fuel now.\"\n\n\"Are the others guarding you?\" Kent asked quickly.\n\n\"They're down in the lower deck at the tanks and airlocks. They won't\nallow me down on that deck. I'm up here in the middle-deck, absolutely\nalone.\n\n\"Jandron told me that we'd start out of here as soon as the fuel was\nin,\" she added, \"and he and the men were laughing about Krell.\"\n\n\"Marta, could you in any way get space-helmets and get out to bring them\nover here to us?\" Kent asked eagerly.\n\n\"There's a lot of space-suits and helmets here,\" she answered, \"but I\ncouldn't get out with them, Rance! I couldn't get to the airlocks with\nJandron's seven or eight men down there guarding them!\"\n\nKent felt despair; then as an idea suddenly flamed in him, he almost\nshouted into the instrument:\n\n\"Marta, unless you can get over here with helmets for us, we're all\nlost. I want you to put on a space-suit and helmet at once!\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThere was a short silence, and then her voice came, a little muffled.\n\"I've got the suit and helmet on, Rance. I'm wearing the suit-phone\ninside it.\"\n\n\"Good! Now, can you get up to the pilot-house? There's no one guarding\nit or the upper-deck? Hurry up there, then, at once.\"\n\nCrain and the rest were staring at Kent. \"Kent, what are you going to\nhave her do?\" Crain exclaimed. \"It'll do no good for her to start the\n_Pallas_: those guards will be up there in a minute!\"\n\n\"I'm not going to have her start the _Pallas_,\" said Kent grimly.\n\"Marta, you're in the pilot-house? Do you see the heavy little steel\ndoor in the wall beside the instrument-panel?\"\n\n\"I'm at it, but it's locked with a combination-lock,\" she said.\n\n\"The combination is 6-34-77-81,\" Kent told her swiftly. \"Open it as\nquickly as you can.\"\n\n\"Good God, Kent!\" cried Crain. \"You're going to have her--?\"\n\n\"Get out of there the only way she can!\" Kent finished fiercely. \"You\nhave the door open, Marta?\"\n\n\"Yes; there are six or seven control-wheels inside.\"\n\n\"Those wheels control the _Pallas'_ exhaust-valves,\" Kent told her.\n\"Each wheel opens the valves of one of the ship's decks or compartments\nand allows its air to escape into space. They're used for testing leaks\nin the different deck and compartment divisions. Marta, you must turn\nall those wheels as far as you can to the right.\"\n\n\"But all the ship's air will rush out; the guards below have no suits\non, and they'll be--\" she was exclaiming. Kent interrupted.\n\n\"It's the only chance for you, for all of us. Turn them!\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence, and Kent was going to repeat the order\nwhen her voice came, lower in tone, a little strange:\n\n\"I understand, Rance. I'm going to turn them.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThere was silence again, and Kent and the men grouped round him were\ntense. All were envisioning the same thing--the air rushing out of the\n_Pallas'_ valves, and the unsuspecting guards in its lower deck smitten\nsuddenly by an instantaneous death.\n\nThen Marta's voice, almost a sob: \"I turned them, Rance. The air puffed\nout all around me.\"\n\n\"Your space-suit is working all right?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" she said.\n\n\"Then go down and tie together as many space-helmets as you can manage,\nget out of the airlock, and try to get over here to the _Martian Queen_\nwith them. Do you think you can do that, Marta?\"\n\n\"I'm going to try,\" she said steadily. \"But I'll have to pass those men\nin the lower-deck I just--killed. Don't be anxious if I don't talk for a\nlittle.\"\n\nYet her voice came again almost immediately. \"Rance, the pumping has\nstopped! They must have pumped all the fuel into the _Pallas_!\"\n\n\"Then Jandron and the rest will be coming back to the _Pallas_ at once!\"\nKent cried. \"Hurry, Marta!\"\n\nThe suit-phone was silent; and Kent and the rest, their faces closely\npressed against the deck-windows, peered intently along the wreck-pack's\nedge. The _Pallas_ was hidden from their view by the wrecks between, and\nthere was no sign as yet of the girl.\n\nKent felt his heart beating rapidly. Crain and Liggett pressed beside\nhim, the men around them; Krell's face was a mask as he too gazed. Kent\nwas rapidly becoming convinced that some mischance had overtaken the\ngirl when an exclamation came from Liggett. He pointed excitedly.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nShe was in sight, unrecognizable in space-suit and helmet, floating\nalong the wreck-pack's edge toward them. A mass of the glassite\nspace-helmets tied together was in her grasp. She climbed bravely over\nthe stern of a projecting wreck and shot on toward the _Martian Queen_.\n\nThe airlock's door was open for her, and, when she was inside it, the\nouter door closed and air hissed into the lock. In a moment she was in\namong them, still clinging to the helmets. Kent grasped her swaying\nfigure and removed her helmet.\n\n\"Marta, you're all right?\" he cried. She nodded a little weakly.\n\n\"I'm all right. It was just that I had to go over those guards that were\nall frozen.... Terrible!\"\n\n\"Get these helmets on!\" Crain was crying. \"There's a dozen of them, and\ntwelve of us can stop Jandron's men if we get back in time!\"\n\nKent and Liggett and the nearer of their men were swiftly donning the\nhelmets. Krell grasped one and Crain sought to snatch it.\n\n\"Let that go! We'll not have you with us when we haven't enough helmets\nfor our own men!\"\n\n\"You'll have me or kill me here!\" Krell cried, his eyes hate-mad. \"I've\ngot my own account to settle with Jandron!\"\n\n\"Let him have it!\" Liggett cried. \"We've no time now to argue!\"\n\nKent reached toward the girl. \"Marta, give one of the men your helmet,\"\nhe ordered; but she shook her head.\n\n\"I'm going with you!\" Before Kent could dispute she had the helmet on\nagain, and Crain was pushing them into the airlock. The nine or ten left\ninside without helmets hastily thrust steel bars into the men's hands\nbefore the inner door closed. The outer one opened and they leapt forth\ninto space, floating smoothly along the wreck-pack's border with bars in\ntheir grasp, thirteen strong.\n\nKent found the slowness with which they floated forward torturing. He\nglimpsed Crain and Liggett ahead, Marta beside him, Krell floating\nbehind him to the left. They reached the projecting freighters, climbed\nover and around them, braced against them and shot on. They sighted the\n_Pallas_ ahead now. Suddenly they discerned another group of eleven\nfigures in space-suits approaching it from the wreck-pack's interior,\nrolling up the tube-line that led from the _Pallas_ as they did so.\nJandron's party!\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nJandron and his men had seen them and were suddenly making greater\nefforts to reach the _Pallas_. Kent and his companions, propelling\nthemselves frenziedly on from another wreck, reached the ship's side at\nthe same time as Jandron's men. The two groups mixed and mingled,\ntwisted and turned in a mad space-combat.\n\nKent had been grasped by one of Jandron's men and raised his bar to\ncrack the other's glassite helmet. His opponent caught the bar, and they\nstruggled, twisting and turning over and over far up in space amid a\nhalf-score similar struggles. Kent wrenched his bar free at last from\nthe other's grasp and brought it down on his helmet. The glassite\ncracked, and he caught a glimpse of the man's hate-distorted face frozen\ninstantly in death.\n\nKent released him and propelled himself toward a struggling trio nearby.\nAs he floated toward them, he saw Jandron beyond them making wild\ngestures of command and saw Krell approaching Jandron with upraised bar.\nKent, on reaching the three combatants, found them to be two of\nJandron's men overcoming Crain. He shattered one's helmet as he reached\nthem, but saw the other's bar go up for a blow.\n\nKent twisted frantically, uselessly, to escape it, but before the blow\ncould descend a bar shattered his opponent's helmet from behind. As the\nman froze in instant death Kent saw that it was Marta who had struck him\nfrom behind. He jerked her to his side. The struggles in space around\nthem seemed to be ending.\n\nSix of Jandron's party had been slain, and three of Kent's companions.\nJandron's four other followers were giving up the combat, floating off\ninto the wreck-pack in clumsy, hasty flight. Someone grasped Kent's arm,\nand he turned to find it was Liggett.\n\n\"They're beaten!\" Liggett's voice came to him! \"They're all killed but\nthose four!\"\n\n\"What about Jandron himself?\" Kent cried. Liggett pointed to two\nspace-suited bodies twisting together in space, with bars still in their\nlifeless grasp.\n\nKent saw through their shattered helmets the stiffened faces of Jandron\nand Krell, their helmets having apparently been broken by each other's\nsimultaneous blows.\n\nCrain had gripped Kent's arm also. \"Kent, it's over!\" he was exclaiming.\n\"Liggett and I will close the _Pallas'_ exhaust-valves and release new\nair in it. You take over helmets for the rest of our men in the _Martian\nQueen_.\"\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nIn several minutes Kent was back with the men from the _Martian Queen_.\nThe _Pallas_ was ready, with Liggett in its pilot-house, the men taking\ntheir stations, and Crain and Marta awaiting Kent.\n\n\"We've enough fuel to take us out of the dead-area and to Neptune\nwithout trouble!\" Crain declared. \"But what about those four of\nJandron's men that got away?\"\n\n\"The best we can do is leave them here,\" Kent told him. \"Best for them,\ntoo, for at Neptune they'd be executed, while they can live indefinitely\nin the wreck-pack.\"\n\n\"I've seen so many men killed on the _Martian Queen_ and here,\" pleaded\nMarta. \"Please don't take them to Neptune.\"\n\n\"All right, we'll leave them,\" Crain agreed, \"though the scoundrels\nought to meet justice.\" He hastened up to the pilot-house after Liggett.\n\nIn a moment came the familiar blast of the rocket-tubes, and the\n_Pallas_ shot out cleanly from the wreck-pack's edge. A scattered cheer\ncame from the crew. With gathering speed the ship arrowed out, its\nrocket-tubes blasting now in steady succession.\n\nKent, with his arm across Marta's shoulders, watched the wreck-pack grow\nsmaller behind. It lay as when he first had seen it, a strange great\nmass, floating forever motionless among the brilliant stars. He felt the\ngirl beside him shiver, and swung her quickly around.\n\n\"Let's not look back or remember now, Marta!\" he said. \"Let's look\nahead.\"\n\nShe nestled closer inside his arm. \"Yes, Rance. Let's look ahead.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Sargasso of Space, by Edmond Hamilton\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SARGASSO OF SPACE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 28832.txt or 28832.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/8/8/3/28832/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Greg Bergquist and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
