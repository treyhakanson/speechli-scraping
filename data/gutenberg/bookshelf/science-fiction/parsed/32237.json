It was a perfect specimen of the gunsmith's art, a\n     semi-automatic rifle with a telescopic sight--a precisely\n     engineered tool that could hurl death with pinpoint accuracy\n     for better than half a mile.\n\nDaniel Matson eyed the weapon with bleak gray eyes, the eyes of a\nhunter framed in the passionless face of an executioner. His blunt\nhands were steady as they lifted the gun and tried a dry shot at an\nimaginary target. He nodded to himself. He was ready. Carefully he\nlaid the rifle down on the mattress which covered the floor of his\nfiring point, and looked out through the hole in the brickwork to the\nnarrow canyon of the street below.\n\nThe crowd had thickened. It had been gathering since early morning,\nand the growing press of spectators had now become solid walls of\npeople lining the street, packed tightly together on the sidewalks.\nYet despite the fact that there were virtually no police, the crowd\ndid not overflow into the streets, nor was there any of the pushing\ncrowding impatience that once attended an assemblage of this sort.\nInstead there was a placid tolerance, a spirit of friendly good will,\nan ingenuous complaisance that grated on Matson's nerves like the\nscreeching rasp of a file drawn across the edge of thin metal. He\nshivered uncontrollably. It was hard to be a free man in a world of\nslaves.\n\nIt was a measure of the Aztlan's triumph that only a bare half-dozen\npolice 'copters patrolled the empty skies above the parade route. The\naliens had done this--had conquered the world without firing a shot or\nspeaking a word in anger. They had wooed Earth with understanding\npatience and superlative guile--and Earth had fallen into their hands\nlike a lovesick virgin! There never had been any real opposition, and\nwhat there was had been completely ineffective. Most of those who had\nopposed the aliens were out of circulation, imprisoned in correctional\ninstitutions, undergoing rehabilitation. Rehabilitation! a six bit\nword for dehumanizing. When those poor devils finished their treatment\nwith Aztlan brain-washing techniques, they would be just like these\nsheep below, with the difference that they would never be able to be\nanything else. But these other stupid fools crowding the sidewalks,\nwaiting to hail their destruction--these were the ones who must be\nsaved. They--not the martyrs of the underground, were the important\npart of humanity.\n\nA police 'copter windmilled slowly down the avenue toward his hiding\nplace, the rotating vanes and insect body of the craft starkly\noutlined against the jagged backdrop of the city's skyline. He laughed\nsoundlessly as the susurrating flutter of the rotor blades beat\noverhead and died whispering in the distance down the long canyon of\nthe street. His position had been chosen with care, and was invisible\nfrom air and ground alike. He had selected it months ago, and had\ntaken considerable pains to conceal its true purpose. But after today\nconcealment wouldn't matter. If things went as he hoped, the place\nmight someday become a shrine. The idea amused him.\n\nStrange, he mused, how events conspire to change a man's career. Seven\nyears ago he had been a respected and important member of that far\ndifferent sort of crowd which had welcomed the visitors from space.\nThat was a human crowd--half afraid, wholly curious, jostling, noisy,\npushing--a teeming swarm that clustered in a thick disorderly ring\naround the silver disc that lay in the center of the International\nAirport overlooking Puget Sound. Then--he could have predicted his\ncareer. And none of the predictions would have been true--for none\nincluded a man with a rifle waiting in a blind for the game to\napproach within range....\n\nThe Aztlan ship had landed early that July morning, dropping silently\nthrough the overcast covering International Airport. It settled gently\nto rest precisely in the center of the junction of the three main\nrunways of the field, effectively tying up the transcontinental and\ntransoceanic traffic. Fully five hundred feet in diameter, the giant\nship squatted massively on the runway junction, cracking and buckling\nthe thick concrete runways under its enormous weight.\n\nBy noon, after the first skepticism had died, and the unbelievable TV\npictures had been flashed to their waiting audience, the crowd began\nto gather. All through that hot July morning they came, increasing by\nthe minute as farther outlying districts poured their curious into the\nAirport. By early afternoon, literally hundreds of millions of eyes\nwere watching the great ship over a world-wide network of television\nstations which cancelled their regular programs to give their viewers\nan uninterrupted view of the enigmatic craft.\n\nBy mid-morning the sun had burned off the overcast and was shining\nwith brassy brilliance upon the squads of sweating soldiers from Fort\nLewis, and more sweating squads of blue-clad police from the\nmetropolitan area of Seattle-Tacoma. The police and soldiery quickly\nformed a ring around the ship and cleared a narrow lane around the\nperiphery, and this they maintained despite the increasing pressure of\nthe crowd.\n\nThe hours passed and nothing happened. The faint creaking and snapping\nsounds as the seamless hull of the vessel warmed its space-chilled\nmetal in the warmth of the summer sun were lost in the growing\nimpatience of the crowd. They wanted something to happen. Shouts and\ncatcalls filled the air as more nervous individuals clamored to\nrelieve the tension. Off to one side a small group began to clap their\nhands rhythmically. The little claque gained recruits, and within\nmoments the air was riven by the thunder of thousands of palms meeting\nin unison. Frightened the crowd might be, but greater than fear was\nthe desire to see what sort of creatures were inside.\n\nMatson stood in the cleared area surrounding the ship, a position of\nprivilege he shared with a few city and state officials and the high\nbrass from McChord Field, Fort Lewis, and Bremerton Navy Yard. He was\none of the bright young men who had chosen Government Service as a\ncareer, and who, in these days of science-consciousness had risen\nrapidly through ability and merit promotions to become the Director of\nthe Office of Scientific Research while still in his early thirties. A\ndedicated man, trained in the bitter school of ideological survival,\nhe understood what the alien science could mean to this world. Their\nknowledge would secure peace in whatever terms the possessors cared to\nname, and Matson intended to make sure that his nation was the one\nwhich possessed that knowledge.\n\nHe stood beside a tall scholarly looking man named Roger Thornton, who\nwas his friend and incidentally the Commissioner of Police for the\nTwin City metropolitan area. To a casual eye, their positions should\nbe reversed, for the lean ascetic Thornton looked far more like the\naccepted idea of a scientist than burly, thick shouldered, square\nfaced Matson, whose every movement shouted Cop.\n\nMatson glanced quizzically at the taller man. \"Well, Roger, I wonder\nhow long those birds inside are going to keep us waiting before we get\na look at them?\"\n\n\"You'd be surprised if they really were birds, wouldn't you?\" Thornton\nasked with a faint smile. \"But seriously, I hope it isn't too much\nlonger. This mob is giving the boys a bad time.\" He looked anxiously\nat the strained line of police and soldiery. \"I guess I should have\nordered out the night shift and reserves instead of just the riot\nsquad. From the looks of things they'll be needed if this crowd gets\nany more unruly.\"\n\nMatson chuckled. \"You're an alarmist,\" he said mildly. \"As far as I\ncan see they're doing all right. I'm not worried about them--or the\ncrowd, for that matter. The thing that's bothering me is my feet. I've\nbeen standing on 'em for six hours and they're killing me!\"\n\n\"Mine too,\" Thornton sighed. \"Tell you what I'll do. When this is all\nover I'll split a bucket of hot water and a pint of arnica with you.\"\n\n\"It's a deal,\" Matson said.\n\nAs he spoke a deep musical hum came from inside the ship, and a\nsection of the rim beside him separated along invisible lines of\njuncture, swinging downward to form a broad ramp leading upward to a\nsquare orifice in the rim of the ship. A bright shadowless light that\nseemed to come from the metal walls of the opening framed the shape of\nthe star traveller who stood there, rigidly erect, looking over the\nheads of the section of the crowd before him.\n\nA concerted gasp of awe and admiration rose from the crowd--a gasp\nthat was echoed throughout the entire ring that surrounded the ship.\nThere must be other openings like this one, Matson thought dully as he\nstared at the being from space. Behind him an Army tank rumbled\nnoisily on its treads as it drove through the crowd toward the ship,\nthe long gun in its turret lifting like an alert finger to point at\nthe figure of the alien.\n\nThe stranger didn't move from his unnaturally stiff position. His\noddly luminous eyes never wavered from their fixed stare at a point\nfar beyond the outermost fringes of the crowd. Seven feet tall,\nobviously masculine, he differed from mankind only in minor details.\nHis long slender hands lacked the little finger, and his waist was\nabnormally small. Other than that, he was human in external\nappearance. A wide sleeved tunic of metallic fabric covered his upper\nbody, gathered in at his narrow waist by a broad metal belt studded\nwith tiny bosses. The tunic ended halfway between hip and knee,\nrevealing powerfully muscled legs encased in silvery hose. Bright\nyellow hair hung to his shoulders, clipped short in a square bang\nacross his forehead. His face was long, clean featured and\nextraordinarily calm--almost godlike in its repose. Matson stared,\nfascinated. He had the curious impression that the visitor had\nstepped bodily out of the Middle Ages. His dress and haircut were\nalmost identical with that of a medieval courtier.\n\nThe starman raised his hand--his strangely luminous steel gray eyes\nscanned the crowd--and into Matson's mind came a wave of peaceful\ncalm, a warm feeling of goodwill and brotherhood, an indescribable\nfeeling of soothing relaxation. With an odd sense of shock Matson\nrealized that he was not the only one to experience this. As far back\nas the farthest hangers-on near the airport gates the tenseness of the\nwaiting crowd relaxed. The effect was amazing! Troops lowered their\nweapons with shamefaced smiles on their faces. Police relaxed their\nsweating vigilance. The crowd stirred, moving backward to give its\nmembers room. The emotion-charged atmosphere vanished as though it had\nnever been. And a cold chill played icy fingers up the spine of Daniel\nMatson. He had felt the full impact of the alien's projection, and he\nwas more frightened than he had ever been in his life!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey had been clever--damnably clever! That initial greeting with its\ndisarming undertones of empathy and innocence had accomplished its\npurpose. It had emasculated Mankind's natural suspicion of strangers.\nAnd their subsequent actions--so beautifully timed--so careful to\navoid the slightest hint of evil, had completed what their\nmagnificently staged appearance had begun.\n\nThe feeling of trust had persisted. It lasted through quarantine,\nclearance, the public receptions, and the private meetings with\nscientists and the heads of government. It had persisted unabated\nthrough the entire two months they remained in the Twin City area. The\naliens remained as they had been in the beginning--completely\nunspoiled by the interest shown in them. They remained simple,\nunaffected, and friendly, displaying an ingenuous innocence that\ndemanded a corresponding faith in return.\n\nMost of their time was spent at the University of Washington, where at\ntheir own request they were studied by curious scholars, and in return\nwere given courses in human history and behavior. They were quite\nfrank about their reasons for following such a course of\naction--according to their spokesman Ixtl they wanted to learn human\nways in order to make a better impression when they visited the rest\nof Mankind. Matson read that blurb in an official press release and\nlaughed cynically. Better impression, hah! They couldn't have done any\nbetter if they had an entire corps of public relations specialists\nassisting them! They struck exactly the right note--and how could they\nimprove on perfection?\n\nFrom the beginning they left their great ship open and unguarded while\nthey commuted back and forth from the airport to the campus. And\nnaturally the government quickly rectified the second error and took\ninstant advantage of the first. A guard was posted around the ship to\nkeep it clear of the unofficially curious, while the officially\ncurious combed the vessel's interior with a fine tooth comb. Teams of\nscientists and technicians under Matson's direction swarmed through\nthe ship, searching with the most advanced methods of human science\nfor the secrets of the aliens.\n\nThey quickly discovered that while the star travellers might be\ntrusting, they were not exactly fools. There was nothing about the\nimpenetrably shielded mechanisms that gave the slightest clue as to\ntheir purpose or to the principles upon which they operated--nor were\nthere any visible controls. The ship was as blankly uncommunicative as\na brick wall.\n\nMatson was annoyed. He had expected more than this, and his\nfrustration drove him to watch the aliens closely. He followed them,\nsat in on their sessions with the scholars at the University, watched\nthem at their frequent public appearances, and came to know them well\nenough to recognize the microscopic differences that made them\nindividuals. To the casual eye they were as alike as peas in a pod,\nbut Matson could separate Farn from Quicha, and Laz from Acana--and\nIxtl--well he would have stood out from the others in any\ncircumstances. But Matson never intruded. He was content to sit in the\nbackground and observe.\n\nAnd what he saw bothered him. They gave him no reason for their\nappearance on Earth, and whenever the question came up Ixtl parried it\nadroitly. They were obviously not explorers for they displayed a\nstartling familiarity with Earth's geography and ecology. They were\npossibly ambassadors, although they behaved like no ambassadors he had\never seen. They might be traders, although what they would trade only\nGod and the aliens knew--and neither party was in a talking mood.\nMysteries bothered Matson. He didn't like them. But they could keep\ntheir mystery if he could only have the technical knowledge that was\nconcealed beneath their beautifully shaped skulls.\n\nAt that, he had to admit that their appearance had come at precisely\nthe right time. No one better than he knew how close Mankind had been\nto the final war, when the last two major antagonists on Earth were\ngirding their human and industrial power for a final showdown. But the\naliens had become a diversion. The impending war was forgotten while\nmen waited to see what was coming next. It was obvious that the\nstarmen had a reason for being here, and until they chose to reveal\nit, humanity would forget its deadly problems in anticipation of the\nanswer to this delightful puzzle that had come to them from outer\nspace. Matson was thankful for the breathing space, all too well aware\nthat it might be the last that Mankind might have, but the enigma of\nthe aliens still bothered him.\n\n\nHe was walking down the main corridor of the Physics Building on the\nUniversity campus, wondering as he constantly did about how he could\nextract some useful knowledge from the aliens when a quiet voice\nspeaking accentless English sounded behind him.\n\n\"What precisely do you wish to know, Dr. Matson?\" the voice said.\n\nMatson whirled to face the questioner, and looked into the face of\nIxtl. The alien was smiling, apparently pleased at having startled\nhim. \"What gave you the idea that I wanted to know anything?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"You did,\" Ixtl said. \"We all have been conscious of your thoughts for\nmany days. Forgive me for intruding, but I must. Your speculations\nradiate on such a broad band that we cannot help being aware of them.\nIt has been quite difficult for us to study your customs and history\nwith this high level background noise. We are aware of your interest,\nbut your thoughts are so confused that we have never found questions\nwe could answer. If you would be more specific we would be happy to\ngive you the information which you seek.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah!\" Matson thought.\n\n\"Of course. It would be to our advantage to have your disturbing\nspeculations satisfied and your fears set at rest. We could accomplish\nmore in a calmer environment. It is too bad that you do not receive as\nstrongly as you transmit. If you did, direct mental contact would\nconvince you that our reasons for satisfying you are good. But you\nneed not fear us, Earthman. We intend you no harm. Indeed, we plan to\nhelp you once we learn enough to formulate a proper program.\"\n\n\"I do not fear you,\" Matson said--knowing that he lied.\n\n\"Perhaps not consciously,\" Ixtl said graciously, \"but nevertheless\nfear is in you. It is too bad--and besides,\" he continued with a faint\nsmile \"it is very uncomfortable. Your glandular emotions are quite\nprimitive, and very disturbing.\"\n\n\"I'll try to keep them under control,\" Matson said dryly.\n\n\"Physical control is not enough. With you there would have to be\nmental control as well. Unfortunately you radiate much more strongly\nthan your fellow men, and we are unable to shut you out without\nexerting considerable effort that could better be employed elsewhere.\"\nThe alien eyed Matson speculatively. \"There you go again,\" he said.\n\"Now you're angry.\"\n\nMatson tried to force his mind to utter blankness, and the alien\nsmiled at him. \"It does some good--but not much,\" he said. \"Conscious\ncontrol is never perfect.\"\n\n\"Well then, what can I do?\"\n\n\"Go away. Your range fortunately is short.\"\n\nMatson looked at the alien. \"Not yet,\" he said coldly. \"I'm still\nlooking for something.\"\n\n\"Our technology,\" Ixtl nodded. \"I know. However I can assure you it\nwill be of no help to you. You simply do not have the necessary\nbackground. Our science is based upon a completely different\nphilosophy from yours.\"\n\nTo Matson the terms were contradictory.\n\n\"Not as much as you think,\" Ixtl continued imperturbably. \"As you will\nfind out, I was speaking quite precisely.\" He paused and eyed Matson\nthoughtfully. \"It seems as though the only way to remove your\ndisturbing presence is to show you that our technology is of no help\nto you. I will make a bargain with you. We shall show you our\nmachines, and in return you will stop harassing us. We will do all in\nour power to make you understand; but whether you do or do not, you\nwill promise to leave and allow us to continue our studies in peace.\nIs that agreeable?\"\n\nMatson swallowed the lump in his throat. Here it was--handed to him on\na silver platter--and suddenly he wasn't sure that he wanted it!\n\n\"It is,\" he said. After all, it was all he could expect.\n\nThey met that night at the spaceship. The aliens, tall, calm and cool;\nMatson stocky, heavy-set and sweating. The contrast was infernally\nsharp, Matson thought. It was as if a primitive savage were meeting a\ngroup of nuclear physicists at Los Alamos. For some unknown reason he\nfelt ashamed that he had forced these people to his wishes. But the\naliens were pleasant about it. They took the imposition in their usual\nfriendly way.\n\n\"Now,\" Ixtl said. \"Exactly what do you want to see--to know?\"\n\n\"First of all, what is the principle of your space drive?\"\n\n\"There are two,\" the alien said. \"The drive that moves this ship in\nnormal space time is derived from Lurgil's Fourth Order equations\nconcerning the release of subatomic energy in a restricted space time\ncontinuum. Now don't protest! I know you know nothing of Lurgil, nor\nof Fourth Order equations. And while I can show you the mathematics,\nI'm afraid they will be of little help. You see, our Fourth Order is\nbased upon a process which you would call Psychomathematics and that\nis something I am sure you have not yet achieved.\"\n\nMatson shook his head. \"I never heard of it,\" he admitted.\n\n\"The second drive operates in warped space time,\" Ixtl continued,\n\"hyperspace in your language, and its theory is much more difficult\nthan that of our normal drive, although its application is quite\nsimple, merely involving apposition of congruent surfaces of hyper and\nnormal space at stress points in the ether where high gravitational\nfields balance. Navigation in hyperspace is done by electronic\ncomputer--somewhat more advanced models than yours. However, I can't\ngive you the basis behind the hyperspace drive.\" Ixtl smiled\ndepreciatingly. \"You see, I don't know them myself. Only a few of the\nmost advanced minds of Aztlan can understand. We merely operate the\nmachines.\"\n\nMatson shrugged. He had expected something like this. Now they would\nstall him off about the machines after handing him a fast line of\ndouble-talk.\n\n\"As I said,\" Ixtl went on, \"there is no basis for understanding.\nStill, if it will satisfy you, we will show you our machines--and the\nmathematics that created them although I doubt that you will learn\nanything more from them than you have from our explanation.\"\n\n\"I could try,\" Matson said grimly.\n\n\"Very well,\" Ixtl replied.\n\nHe led the way into the center of the ship where the seamless housings\nstood, the housings that had baffled some of the better minds of\nEarth. Matson watched while the star men proceeded to be helpful. The\nhousings fell apart at invisible lines of juncture, revealing\nmechanisms of baffling simplicity, and some things that didn't look\nlike machines at all. The aliens stripped the strange devices and Ixtl\nattempted to explain. They had anti-gravity, forcefields, faster than\nlight drive, and advanced design computers that could be packed in a\nsuitcase. There were weird devices whose components seemed to run out\nof sight at crazily impossible angles, other things that rotated\nfrictionlessly, suspended in fields of pure force, and still others\nwhich his mind could not envisage even after his eyes had seen them.\nAll about him lay the evidence of a science so advanced and alien that\nhis brain shrank from the sight, refusing to believe such things\nexisted. And their math was worse! It began where Einstein left off\nand went off at an incomprehensible tangent that involved psychology\nand ESP. Matson was lost after the first five seconds!\n\nStunned, uncomprehending and deflated, he left the ship. An impression\nthat he was standing with his toe barely inside the door of knowledge\nbecame a conscious certainty as he walked slowly to his car. The wry\nthought crossed his mind that if the aliens were trying to convince\nhim of his abysmal ignorance, they had succeeded far beyond their\nfondest dreams!\n\n\nThey certainly had! Matson thought grimly as he selected five\ncartridges from the box lying beside him. In fact they had succeeded\ntoo well. They had turned his deflation into antagonism, his ignorance\ninto distrust. Like a savage, he suspected what he could not\nunderstand. But unlike the true primitive, the emotional distrust\ndidn't interfere with his ability to reason or to draw logical\ninferences from the data which he accumulated. In attempting to\nconvince, Ixtl had oversold his case.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was shortly after he had returned to Washington, that the aliens\ngave the waiting world the reasons for their appearance on Earth. They\nwere, they said, members of a very ancient highly evolved culture\ncalled Aztlan. And the Aztlans, long past the need for conquest and\nexpansion, had turned their mighty science to the help of other, less\nfortunate, races in the galaxy. The aliens were, in a sense,\nmissionaries--one of hundreds of teams travelling the star lanes to\nbring the benefits of Aztlan culture to less favored worlds. They\nwere, they unblushingly admitted, altruists--interested only in\nhelping others.\n\nIt was pure corn, Matson reflected cynically, but the world lapped it\nup and howled for more. After decades of cold war, lukewarm war, and\nsporadic outbreaks of violence, that were inevitably building to\natomic destruction, men were willing to try anything that would ease\nthe continual burden of strain and worry. To Mankind, the Aztlans'\nwords were as refreshing as a cool breeze of hope in a desert of\ndespair.\n\nAnd the world got what it wanted.\n\n\nQuite suddenly the aliens left the Northwest, and accompanied by\nprotective squads of FBI and Secret Service began to cross the nation.\nTaking widely separated paths they visited cities, towns, and farms,\nexhibiting the greatest curiosity about the workings of human\ncivilization. And, in turn, they were examined by hordes of hopeful\nhumans. Everywhere they went, they spread their message of good will\nand hope backed by the incredibly convincing power of their telepathic\nminds. Behind them, they left peace and hopeful calm; before them,\nanticipation mounted. It rose to a crescendo in New York where the\npaths of the star men met.\n\nThe Aztlans invaded the United Nations. They spoke to the General\nAssembly and the Security Council, were interviewed by the secretariat\nand reporters from a hundred foreign lands. They told their story with\nsuch conviction that even the Communist bloc failed to raise an\nobjection, which was as amazing to the majority of the delegates as\nthe fact of the star men themselves. Altruism, it seemed, had no\nconflict with dialectic materialism. The aliens offered a watered-down\nvariety of their technology to the peoples of Earth with no strings\nattached, and the governments of Earth accepted with open hands, much\nas a small boy accepts a cookie from his mother. It was impossible for\nmen to resist the lure of something for nothing, particularly when it\nwas offered by such people as the Aztlans. After all, Matson reflected\nbitterly, nobody shoots Santa Claus!\n\nFrom every nation in the world came invitations to the aliens to visit\ntheir lands. The star men cheerfully accepted. They moved across\nEurope, Asia, and Africa--visited South America, Central America, the\nMiddle East and Oceania. No country escaped them. They absorbed\nlanguages, learned customs, and spread good will. Everywhere they went\nrelaxation followed in their footsteps, and throughout the world arose\na realization of the essential brotherhood of man.\n\nIt took nearly three years of continual travelling before the aliens\nagain assembled at UN headquarters to begin the second part of their\npromised plan--to give their science to Earth. And men waited with\ncalm expectation for the dawn of Golden Age.\n\n\nMatson's lips twisted. Fools! Blind, stupid fools! Selling their\nbirthright for a mess of pottage! He shifted the rifle across his\nknees and began filling the magazine with cartridges. He felt an empty\nloneliness as he closed the action over the filled magazine and turned\nthe safety to \"on\". There was no comforting knowledge of support and\nsympathy to sustain him in what he was about to do. There was no real\nhope that there ever would be. His was a voice crying in the\nwilderness, a voice that was ignored--as it had been when he visited\nthe President of the United States....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMatson entered the White House, presented his appointment card, and\nwas ushered past ice-eyed Secret Service men into the presidential\noffice. It was as close as he had ever been to the Chief Executive,\nand he stared with polite curiosity across the width of desk which\nseparated them.\n\n\"I wanted to see you about the Aztlan business,\" the President began\nwithout preamble. \"You were there when their ship landed, and you are\nalso one of the few men in the country who has seen them alone. In\naddition, your office will probably be handling the bulk of our\nrequests in regard to the offer they made yesterday in the UN. You're\nin a favorable spot.\" The President smiled and shrugged. \"I wanted to\ntalk with you sooner, but business and routine play the devil with\none's desires in this office.\n\n\"Now tell me,\" he continued, \"your impression of these people.\"\n\n\"They're an enigma,\" Matson said flatly. \"To tell the truth, I can't\nfigure them out.\" He ran his fingers through his hair with a worried\ngesture. \"I'm supposed to be a pretty fair physicist, and I've had\nquite a bit of training in the social sciences, but both the\nmechanisms and the psychology of these Aztlans are beyond my\ncomprehension. All I can say for sure is that they're as far beyond us\nas we are beyond the cavemen. In fact, we have so little in common\nthat I can't think of a single reason why they would want to stay\nhere, and the fact that they do only adds to my confusion.\"\n\n\"But you must have learned something,\" the President said.\n\n\"Oh we've managed to collect data,\" Matson replied. \"But there's a lot\nof difference between data and knowledge.\"\n\n\"I can appreciate that, but I'd still like to know what you think.\nYour opinion could have some weight.\"\n\nMatson doubted it. His opinions were contrary to those of the\nmajority. Still, the Chief asked for it--and he might possibly have an\nopen mind. It was a chance worth taking.\n\n\"Well, Sir, I suppose you've heard of the so-called \"wild talents\"\nsome of our own people occasionally possess?\"\n\nThe President nodded.\n\n\"It is my belief,\" Matson continued, \"that the Aztlans possess these\nto a far greater degree than we do, and that their science is based\nupon them. They have something which they call psychomathematics,\nwhich by definition is the mathematics of the mind, and this seems to\nbe the basis of their physical science. I saw their machines, and I\nmust confess that their purpose baffled me until I realized that they\nmust be mechanisms for amplifying their own natural equipment. We know\nlittle or nothing about psi phenomena, so it is no wonder I couldn't\nfigure them out. As a matter of fact we've always treated psi as\nsomething that shouldn't be mentioned in polite scientific\nconversation.\"\n\nThe President grinned. \"I always thought you boys had your blind\nspots.\"\n\n\"We do--but when we're confronted with a fact, we try to find out\nsomething about it--that is if the fact hits us hard enough, often\nenough.\"\n\n\"Well, you've been hit hard and often,\" the President chuckled, \"What\ndid you find out?\"\n\n\"Facts,\" Matson said grimly, \"just facts. Things that could be\ndetermined by observation and measurement. We know that the aliens are\ntelepathic. We also know that they have a form of ESP--or perhaps a\nrecognition of danger would be a better term--and we know its range is\nsomewhat over a third of a mile. We know that they're telekinetic. The\nlack of visible controls in their ship would tell us that, even if we\nhadn't seen them move small objects at a distance. We know that they\nhave eidetic memories, and that they can reason on an extremely high\nlevel. Other than that we know nothing. We don't even know their\nphysical structure. We've tried X-ray but they're radio-opaque. We've\ntried using some human sensitives from the Rhine Institute, but\nthey're unable to get anywhere. They just turn empathic in the aliens'\npresence, and when we get them back, they do nothing but babble about\nthe beauty of the Aztlan soul.\"\n\n\"Considering the difficulties, you haven't done too badly,\" the\nPresident said. \"I take it then, that you're convinced that they are\nan advanced life form. But do you think they're sincere in their\nattitude toward us?\"\n\n\"Oh, they're sincere enough,\" Matson said. \"The only trouble is that\nwe don't know just what they're sincere about. You see, sir, we are in\nthe position of a savage to whom a trader brings the luxuries of\ncivilization. To the savage, the trader may represent purest altruism,\ngiving away such valuable things as glass beads and machine made cloth\nfor useless pieces of yellow rock and the skins of some native pest.\nThe savage hasn't the slightest inkling that he's being exploited. By\nthe time he realizes he's been had, and the yellow rock is gold and\nthe skins are mink, he has become so dependent upon the goods for\nwhich the trader has whetted his appetite that he inevitably becomes\nan economic slave.\n\n\"Of course you can argue that the cloth and beads are far more\nvaluable to the savage than the gold or mink. But in the last\nanalysis, value is determined by the higher culture, and by that\nstandard, the savage gets taken. And ultimately civilization moves in\nand the superior culture of the trader's race determines how the\nsavage will act.\n\n\"Still, the savage has a basis for his acts. He is giving something\nfor something--making a trade. But we're not even in that position.\nThe aliens apparently want nothing from us. They have asked for\nnothing except our good will, and that isn't a tradable item.\"\n\n\"But they're altruists!\" the President protested.\n\n\"Sir, do you think that they're insane?\" Matson asked curiously. \"Do\nthey appear like fanatics to you?\"\n\n\"But we can't apply our standards to them. You yourself have said that\ntheir civilization is more advanced than ours.\"\n\n\"Whose standards can we apply?\" Matson asked. \"If not ours, then\nwhose? The only standards that we can possibly apply are our own, and\nin the entire history of human experience there has never been a\nsingle culture that has had a basis of pure altruism. Such a culture\ncould not possibly exist. It would be overrun and gobbled up by its\npractical neighbors before it drew its first breath.\n\n\"We must assume that the culture from which these aliens come has had\na practical basis in its evolutionary history. It could not have risen\nfull blown and altruistic like Minerva from the brain of Jove. And if\nthe culture had a practical basis in the past, it logically follows\nthat it has a practical basis in the present. Such a survival trait as\npracticality would probably never be lost no matter how far the Aztlan\nrace has evolved. Therefore, we must concede that they are practical\npeople--people who do not give away something for nothing. But the\nquestion still remains--what do they want?\n\n\"Whatever it is, I don't think it is anything from which we will\nprofit. No matter how good it looks, I am convinced that cooperation\nwith these aliens will not ultimately be to our advantage. Despite the\nreports of every investigative agency in this government, I cannot\nbelieve that any such thing as pure altruism exists in a sane mind.\nAnd whatever I may believe about the Aztlans, I do not think they're\ninsane.\"\n\nThe President sighed. \"You are a suspicious man, Matson, and perhaps\nyou are right; but it doesn't matter what you believe--or what I\nbelieve for that matter. This government has decided to accept the\nhelp the Aztlans are so graciously offering. And until the reverse is\nproven, we must accept the fact that the star men _are_ altruists, and\nwork with them on that basis. You will organize your office along\nthose lines, and extract every gram of information that you can. Even\nyou must admit that they have knowledge that will improve our American\nway of life.\"\n\nMatson shook his head doggedly. \"I'm afraid, Sir, if you expect Aztlan\nscience to improve the American way of life, you are going to be\ndisappointed. It might promote an Aztlan way of life, but the reverse\nis hardly possible.\"\n\n\"It's not my decision,\" the President said. \"My hands are tied.\nCongress voted for the deal by acclamation early this morning. I\ncouldn't veto it even if I wanted to.\"\n\n\"I cannot cooperate in what I believe is our destruction.\" Matson said\nin a flat voice.\n\n\"Then you have only one course,\" the President said. \"I will be forced\nto accept your resignation.\" He sighed wearily.\n\n\"Personally, I think you're making a mistake. Think it over before\nyou decide. You're a good man, and Lord knows the government can use\ngood men. There are far too many fools in politics.\" He shrugged and\nstood up. The interview was over.\n\nMatson returned to his offices, filled with cold frustration. Even the\nPresident believed he could do nothing, and these shortsighted\npoliticians who could see nothing more than the immediate gains--there\nwas a special hell reserved for them. There were too many fools in\npolitics. However, he would do what he could. His sense of duty was\nstronger than his resentment. He would stay on and try to cushion some\nof the damage which the Aztlans would inevitably cause, no matter how\ninnocent their motives. And perhaps the President was right--perhaps\nthe alien science would bring more good than harm.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the next two years Matson watched the spread of Aztlan ideas\nthroughout the world. He saw Aztlan devices bring health, food and\nshelter to millions in underprivileged countries, and improve the lot\nof those in more favored nations. He watched tyrannies and\nauthoritarian governments fall under the passive resistance of their\npeoples. He saw militarism crumble to impotence as the Aztlan\ninfluence spread through every facet of society, first as a trickle,\nthen as a steady stream, and finally as a rushing torrent. He saw\nMankind on the brink of a Golden Age--and he was unsatisfied.\n\nReason said that the star men were exactly what they claimed to be.\nTheir every action proved it. Their consistency was perfect, their\nmotives unimpeachable, and the results of their efforts were\nastounding. Life on Earth was becoming pleasant for millions who never\nknew the meaning of the word. Living standards improved, and\neverywhere men were conscious of a feeling of warmth and brotherhood.\nThere was no question that the aliens were doing exactly what they\npromised.\n\nBut reason also told him that the aliens were subtly and methodically\ndestroying everything that man had created, turning him from an\nindividual into a satisfied puppet operated by Aztlan strings. For man\nis essentially lazy--always searching for the easier way. Why should\nhe struggle to find an answer when the Aztlans had discovered it\nmillennia ago and were perfectly willing to share their knowledge? Why\nshould he use inept human devices when those of the aliens performed\nsimilar operations with infinitely more ease and efficiency? Why\nshould he work when all he had to do was ask? There was plan behind\ntheir acts.\n\nBut at that point reason dissolved into pure speculation. Why were\nthey doing this? Was it merely mistaken kindliness or was there a\ndeeper more subtle motive? Matson didn't know, and in that lack of\nknowledge lay the hell in which he struggled.\n\n\nFor two years he stayed on with the OSR, watching humanity rush down\nan unmarked road to an uncertain future. Then he ran away. He could\ntake no more of this blind dependence upon alien wisdom. And with the\nchange in administration that had occurred in the fall elections he no\nlonger had the sense of personal loyalty to the President which had\nkept him working at a job he despised. He wanted no part of this brave\nnew world the aliens were creating. He wanted to be alone. Like a\nhermit of ancient times who abandoned society to seek his soul, Matson\nfled to the desert country of the South-west--as far as possible from\nthe Aztlans and their works.\n\nThe grimly beautiful land toughened his muscles, blackened his skin,\nand brought him a measure of peace. Humanity retreated to remoteness\nexcept for Seth Winters, a leathery old-timer he had met on his first\ntrip into the desert. The acquaintance had ripened to friendship. Seth\nfurnished a knowledge of the desert country which Matson lacked, and\nMatson's money provided the occasional grubstake they needed. For\nweeks at a time they never saw another human--and Matson was\nsatisfied. The world could go its own way. He would go his.\n\nRunning away was the smartest thing he could have done. Others more\nbrave perhaps, or perhaps less rational--had tried to fight, to form\nan underground movement to oppose these altruists from space; but they\nwere a tiny minority so divided in motives and purpose that they could\nnot act as a unit. They were never more than a nuisance, and without\npopular support they never had a chance. After the failure of a\ncomplicated plot to assassinate the aliens, they were quickly rounded\nup and confined. And the aliens continued their work.\n\n\nMatson shrugged. It was funny how little things could mark mileposts\nin a man's life. If he had known of the underground he probably would\nhave joined it and suffered the same penalty for failure. If he hadn't\nfled, if he hadn't met Seth Winters, if he hadn't taken that last trip\ninto the desert, if any one of a hundred little things had happened\ndifferently he would not be here. That last trip into the desert--he\nremembered it as though it were yesterday....\n\n\nThe yellow flare of a greasewood fire cast flickering spears of light\ninto the encircling darkness. Above, in the purplish black vault of\nthe moonless sky the stars shone down with icy splendor. The air was\nquiet, the evening breeze had died, and the stillness of the desert\nnight pressed softly upon the earth. Far away, muted by distance, came\nthe ululating wail of a coyote.\n\nSeth Winters laid another stick of quick-burning greasewood on the\nfire and squinted across the smoke at Matson who was lying on his\nback, arms crossed behind his head, eyeing the night sky with the\nfascination of a dreamer.\n\n\"It's certainly peaceful out here,\" Matson murmured as he rose to his\nfeet, stretched, and sat down again looking into the tiny fire.\n\n\"'Tain't nothin' unusual, Dan'l. Not out here it ain't. It's been\nplumb peaceful on this here desert nigh onto a million years. An'\nwhy's it peaceful? Mainly 'cuz there ain't too many humans messin'\naround in it.\"\n\n\"Possibly you're right, Seth.\"\n\n\"Shore I'm right. It jest ain't nacheral fer a bunch of Homo saps to\nget together without an argyment startin' somewhere. 'Tain't the\nnature of the critter to be peaceable. An' y'know, thet's the part of\nthis here sweetness an' light between nations that bothers me. Last\ntime I was in Prescott, I set down an' read six months of\nnewspapers--an' everything's jest too damn good to be true. Seems like\neverybody's gettin' to love everybody else.\" He shook his head. \"The\nhull world's as sticky-sweet as molasses candy. It jest ain't\nnacheral!\"\n\n\"The star men are keeping their word. They said that they would bring\nus peace. Isn't that what they're doing?\"\n\n\"Shucks Dan'l--that don't give 'em no call to make the world a blasted\nhoney-pot with everybody bubblin' over with brotherly love. There\nain't no real excitement left. Even the Commies ain't raisin' hell\nlike they useta. People are gettin' more like a bunch of damn woolies\nevery day.\"\n\n\"I'll admit that Mankind had herd instincts,\" Matson replied lazily,\n\"but I've never thought of them as particularly sheeplike. More like a\nwolf pack, I'd say.\"\n\n\"Wal, there's nothin' wolflike about 'em right now. Look, Dan'l, yuh\nknow what a wolf pack's like. They're smart, tough, and mean--an' the\nold boss wolf is the smartest, toughest, and meanest critter in the\nhull pack. The others respect him 'cuz he's proved his ability to\nlead. But take a sheep flock now--the bellwether is jest a nice gentle\nold castrate thet'll do jest whut the sheepherder wants. He's got no\noriginality. He's jest a noise thet the rest foller.\"\n\n\"Could be.\"\n\n\"It shore is! Jes f'r instance, an' speakin' of bellwethers, have yuh\never heard of a character called Throckmorton Bixbee?\"\n\n\"Can't say I have. He sounds like a nance.\"\n\n\"Whutever a nance is--he's it! But yuh're talkin' about our next\nPresident, unless all the prophets are wrong. He's jest as bad as his\nname. Of all the gutless wonders I've ever heard of that pilgrim takes\nthe prize. He even looks like a rabbit!\"\n\n\"I can see where I had better catch up on some contemporary history,\"\nMatson said. \"I've been out in the sticks too long.\"\n\n\"If yuh know what's good fer yuh, yuh'll stay here. The rest of the\ncountry's goin' t'hell. Brother Bixbee's jest a sample. About the only\nthing that'd recommend him is that he's hot fer peace--an' he's got\nthose furriners' blessing. Seems like those freaks swing a lotta\nweight nowadays, an' they ain't shy about tellin' folks who an' what\nthey favor. They've got bold as brass this past year.\"\n\nMatson nodded idly--then stiffened--turning a wide eyed stare on Seth.\nA blinding light exploded in his brain as the words sank in. With\ncrystal clarity he knew the answer! He laughed harshly.\n\nWinters stared at him with mild surprise. \"What's bit yuh, Dan'l?\"\n\nBut Matson was completely oblivious, busily buttressing the flash of\ninspiration. Sure--that was the only thing it could be! Those aliens\nwere working on a program--one that was grimly recognizable once his\nattention was focussed on it. There must have been considerable\npressure to make them move so fast that a short-lived human could see\nwhat they were planning--but Matson had a good idea of what was\ndriving them, an atomic war that could decimate the world would be all\nthe spur they'd need!\n\nThey weren't playing for penny ante stakes. They didn't want to\nexploit Mankind. They didn't give a damn about Mankind! To them\nhumanity was merely an unavoidable nuisance--something to be pushed\naside, to be made harmless and dependent, and ultimately to be quietly\nand bloodlessly eliminated. Man's civilization held nothing that the\nstar men wanted, but man's planet--that was a different story! Truly\nthe aliens were right when they considered man a savage. Like the\nsavage, man didn't realize his most valuable possession was his land!\n\nThe peaceful penetration was what had fooled him. Mankind, faced with\na similar situation, and working from a position of overwhelming\nstrength would have reacted differently. Humanity would have invaded\nand conquered. But the aliens had not even considered this obvious\nstep.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe answer was simple and logical. They couldn't! Even though their\ntechnology was advanced enough to exterminate man with little or no\nloss to themselves, combat and slaughter must be repulsive to them. It\nhad to be. With their telepathic minds they would necessarily have a\npathologic horror of suffering. They were so highly evolved that they\nsimply couldn't fight--at least not with the weapons of humanity. But\nthey could use the subtler weapon of altruism!\n\nAnd even more important--uncontrolled emotions were poison to them. In\nfact Ixtl had admitted it back in Seattle. The primitive psi waves of\nhumanity's hates, lusts, fears, and exultations must be unbearable\ntorture to a race long past such animal outbursts. That was--must\nbe--why they were moving so fast. For their own safety, emotion had to\nbe damped out of the human race.\n\nMatson had a faint conception of what the aliens must have suffered\nwhen they first surveyed that crowd at International Airport. No\nwonder they looked so strangely immobile at that first contact! The\nraw emotion must have nearly killed them! He felt a reluctant stir of\nadmiration for their courage, for the dedicated bravery needed to face\nthat crowd and establish a beachhead of tranquility. Those first few\nminutes must have had compressed in them the agonies of a lifetime!\n\nMatson grinned coldly. The aliens were not invulnerable. If Mankind\ncould be taught to fear and hate them, and if that emotion could be\nfocussed, they never again would try to take this world. It would be\nsheer suicide. As long as Mankind kept its emotions it would be safe\nfrom this sort of invasion. But the problem was to teach Mankind to\nfear and hate. Shock would do it, but how could that shock be applied?\n\nThe thought led inevitably to the only possible conclusion. The aliens\nwould have to be killed, and in such a manner as to make humanity fear\nretaliation from the stars. Fear would unite men against a possible\ninvasion, and fear would force men to reach for the stars to forestall\nretribution.\n\nMatson grinned thinly. Human nature couldn't have changed much these\npast years. Even with master psychologists like the Aztlans operating\nupon it, changes in emotional pattern would require generations. He\nsighed, looked into the anxious face of Seth Winters, and returned to\nthe reality of the desert night. His course was set. He knew what he\nhad to do.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe laid the rifle across his knees and opened the little leather box\nsewn to the side of the guncase. With precise, careful movements he\nremoved the silencer and fitted it to the threaded muzzle of the gun.\nThe bulky, blue excrescence changed the rifle from a thing of beauty\nto one of murder. He looked at it distastefully, then shrugged and\nstretched out on the mattress, easing the ugly muzzle through the hole\nin the brickwork. It wouldn't be long now....\n\nHe glanced upward through the window above him at the Weather Bureau\ninstruments atop a nearby building. The metal cups of the anemometer\nhung motionless against the metallic blue of the sky. No wind stirred\nin the deep canyons of the city streets as the sun climbed in blazing\nsplendor above the towering buildings. He moved a trifle, shifting the\nmuzzle of the gun until it bore upon the sidewalks. The telescopic\nsight picked out faces from the waiting crowd with a crystal clarity.\nEverywhere was the same sheeplike placidity. He shuddered, the sights\njumping crazily from one face to another,--wondering if he had\nmisjudged his race, if he had really come too late, if he had\nunderestimated the powers of the Aztlans.\n\nFar down the avenue, an excited hum came to his ears, and the watching\ncrowd stirred. Faces lighted and Matson sighed. He was not wrong.\nEmotion was only suppressed, not vanished. There was still time!\n\nThe aliens were coming. Coming to cap the climax of their pioneer\nwork, to drive the first nail in humanity's coffin! For the first time\nin history man's dream of the brotherhood of man was close to reality.\n\nAnd he was about to destroy it! The irony bit into Matson's soul, and\nfor a moment he hesitated, feeling the wave of tolerance and good will\nrising from the street below. Did he have the right to destroy man's\ndream? Did he dare tamper with the will of the world? Had he the right\nto play God?\n\nThe parade came slowly down the happy street, a kaleidoscope of color\nand movement that approached and went past in successive waves and\nmasses. This was a gala day, this eve of world union! The insigne of\nthe UN was everywhere. The aliens had used the organization to further\ntheir plans and it was now all-powerful. A solid bank of UN flags led\nthe van of delegates, smiling and swathed in formal dress, sitting\nerect in their black official cars draped with the flags of native\nlands that would soon be furled forever if the aliens had their way.\n\nAnd behind them came the Aztlans!\n\n\nThey rode together, standing on a pure white float, a bar of dazzling\nwhite in a sea of color. All equal, their inhumanly beautiful faces\ncalm and remote, the Aztlans rode through the joyful crowd. There was\nsomething inspiring about the sight and for a moment, Matson felt a\nwave of revulsion sweep through him.\n\nHe sighed and thumbed the safety to \"off\", pulled the cocking lever\nand slid the first cartridge into the breech. He settled himself\ndrawing a breath of air into his lungs, letting a little dribble out\nthrough slack lips, catching the remainder of the exhalation with\nclosed glottis. The sights wavered and steadied upon the head of the\ncenter alien, framing the pale noble face with its aureole of golden\nhair. The luminous eyes were dull and introspective as the alien tried\nto withdraw from the emotions of the crowd. There was no awareness of\ndanger on the alien's face. At 600 yards he was beyond their esper\nrange and he was further covered by the feelings of the crowd. The\nsights lowered to the broad chest and centered there as Matson's\nspatulate fingers took up the slack in the trigger and squeezed softly\nand steadily.\n\n\nA coruscating glow bathed the bodies of three of the aliens as their\ntall forms jerked to the smashing impact of the bullets! Their\nmetallic tunics melted and sloughed as inner fires ate away the\nfragile garments that covered them! Flexible synthetic skin cracked\nand curled in the infernal heat, revealing padding, wirelike tendons,\nrope-like cords of flexible tubing and a metallic skeleton that melted\nand dripped in white hot drops in the heat of atomic flame--\n\n\"Robots!\" Matson gasped with sudden blinding realization. \"I should\nhave known! No wonder they seemed inhuman. Their builders would never\ndare expose themselves to the furies and conflicts of our emotionally\nuncontrolled world!\"\n\nOne of the aliens crouched on the float, his four-fingered hands\npressed against a smoking hole in his metal tunic. The smoke thickened\nand a yellowish ichor poured out bursting into flame on contact with\nthe air. The fifth alien, Ixtl, was untouched, standing with hands\nwidestretched in a gesture that at once held command and appeal.\n\nMatson reloaded quickly, but held his fire. The swarming crowd\nsurrounding the alien was too thick for a clear shot and Matson, with\nsudden revulsion, was unwilling to risk further murder in a cause\nalready won. The tall, silver figure of the alien winced and\nshuddered, his huge body shaking like a leaf in a storm! His builders\nhad never designed him to withstand the barrage of focussed emotion\nthat was sweeping from the crowd. Terror, shock, sympathy, hate,\nloathing, grief, and disillusionment--the incredible gamut of human\nfeelings wrenched and tore at the Aztlan, shorting delicate circuits,\nripping the poised balance of his being as the violent discordant\nblasts lanced through him with destroying energy! Ixtl's classic\nfeatures twisted in a spasm of inconceivable agony, a thin curl of\nsmoke drifted from his distorted tragic mask of a mouth as he\ncrumpled, a pitiful deflated figure against the whiteness of the\nfloat.\n\nThe cries of fear and horror changed their note as the aliens' true\nnature dawned upon the crowd. Pride of flesh recoiled as the swarming\nhumans realized the facts. Revulsion at being led by machines swelled\ninto raw red rage. The mob madness spread as an ominous growl began\nrising from the streets.\n\nA panicky policeman triggered it, firing his Aztlan-built shock tube\ninto the forefront of the mob. A dozen men fell, to be trampled by\ntheir neighbors as a swarm of men and women poured over the struggling\nofficer and buried him from sight. Like wildfire, pent-up emotions\nblazed out in a flame of fury. The parade vanished, sucked into the\nmaelstrom and torn apart. Fists flew, flesh tore, men and women\nscreamed in high bitter agony as the mob clawed and trampled in a\nsurging press of writhing forms that filled the street from one line\nof buildings to the other.\n\nHalf-mad with triumph, drunk with victory, shocked at the terrible\nform that death had taken in coming to Ixtl, Matson raised his\nclenched hands to the sky and screamed in a raw inhuman voice, a cry\nin which all of man's violence and pride were blended! The spasm\npassed as quickly as it came, and with its passing came exhaustion.\nThe job was done. The aliens were destroyed. Tomorrow would bring\nreaction and with it would come fear.\n\nTomorrow or the next day man would hammer out a true world union,\nspurred by the thought of a retribution that would never come. Yet all\nthat didn't matter. The important thing--the only important thing--was\npreserved. Mankind would have to unite for survival--or so men would\nthink--and he would never disillusion them. For this was man's world,\nand men were again free to work out their own destiny for better or\nfor worse, without interference, and without help. The golden dream\nwas over. Man might fail, but if he did he would fail on his own\nterms. And if he succeeded--Matson looked up grimly at the shining\nsky....\n\nSlowly he rose to his feet and descended to the raging street below.\n\nEND\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Assassin, by Jesse Franklin Bone\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ASSASSIN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32237.txt or 32237.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/2/3/32237/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
