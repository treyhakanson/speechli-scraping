He stood on the deck of the shantyboat, his toes sticking out of\nhis socks, his heart knocking against his ribs. Straight down the river\nthe big packet boat came, purpling the water with its shadow, its\nsmokestacks belching soot.\n\nJimmy had a wild talent for collecting things. He knew exactly how to\ninfuriate the captains without sticking out his neck. Up and down the\nFather of Waters, from the bayous of Louisiana to the Great Sandy other\nlittle shantyboat boys envied Jimmy and tried hard to imitate him.\n\nBut Jimmy had a very special gift, a genius for pantomime. He'd wait\nuntil there was a glimmer of red flame on the river and small objects\nstood out with a startling clarity. Then he'd go into his act.\n\nNothing upset the captains quite so much as Jimmy's habit of holding a\nbig, croaking bullfrog up by its legs as the riverboats went steaming\npast. It was a surefire way of reminding the captains that men and frogs\nwere brothers under the skin. The puffed-out throat of the frog told the\ncaptains exactly what Jimmy thought of their cheek.\n\nJimmy refrained from making faces, or sticking out his tongue at the\ngrinning roustabouts. It was the frog that did the trick.\n\nIn the still dawn things came sailing Jimmy's way, hurled by captains\nwith a twinkle of repressed merriment dancing in eyes that were kindlier\nand more tolerant than Jimmy dreamed.\n\nJust because shantyboat folk had no right to insult the riverboats Jimmy\nhad collected forty empty tobacco tins, a down-at-heels shoe, a Sears\nRoebuck catalogue and--more rolled up newspapers than Jimmy could ever\nread.\n\nJimmy could read, of course. No matter how badly Uncle Al needed a new\npair of shoes, Jimmy's education came first. So Jimmy had spent six\nwinters ashore in a first-class grammar school, his books paid for out\nof Uncle Al's \"New Orleans\" money.\n\nUncle Al, blowing on a vinegar jug and making sweet music, the holes in\nhis socks much bigger than the holes in Jimmy's socks. Uncle Al shaking\nhis head and saying sadly, \"Some day, young fella, I ain't gonna sit\nhere harmonizing. No siree! I'm gonna buy myself a brand new store suit,\ntrade in this here jig jug for a big round banjo, and hie myself off to\nthe Mardi Gras. Ain't too old thataway to git a little fun out of life,\nyoung fella!\"\n\nPoor old Uncle Al. The money he'd saved up for the Mardi Gras never\nseemed to stretch far enough. There was enough kindness in him to\nstretch like a rainbow over the bayous and the river forests of sweet,\nrustling pine for as far as the eye could see. Enough kindness to wrap\nall of Jimmy's life in a glow, and the life of Jimmy's sister as well.\n\nJimmy's parents had died of winter pneumonia too soon to appreciate\nUncle Al. But up and down the river everyone knew that Uncle Al was a\ngreat man.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEnemies? Well, sure, all great men made enemies, didn't they?\n\nThe Harmon brothers were downright sinful about carrying their feuding\nmeanness right up to the doorstep of Uncle Al, if it could be said that\na man living in a shantyboat had a doorstep.\n\nUncle Al made big catches and the Harmon brothers never seemed to have\nany luck. So, long before Jimmy was old enough to understand how\ncorrosive envy could be the Harmon brothers had started feuding with\nUncle Al.\n\n\"Jimmy, here comes the _Natchez Belle_! Uncle Al says for you to get him\na newspaper. The newspaper you got him yesterday he couldn't read\nno-ways. It was soaking wet!\"\n\nJimmy turned to glower at his sister. Up and down the river Pigtail Anne\nwas known as a tomboy, but she wasn't--no-ways. She was Jimmy's little\nsister. That meant Jimmy was the man in the family, and wore the pants,\nand nothing Pigtail said or did could change that for one minute.\n\n\"Don't yell at me!\" Jimmy complained. \"How can I get Captain Simmons mad\nif you get me mad first? Have a heart, will you?\"\n\nBut Pigtail Anne refused to budge. Even when the _Natchez Belle_ loomed\nso close to the shantyboat that it blotted out the sky she continued to\ncrowd her brother, preventing him from holding up the frog and making\nCaptain Simmons squirm.\n\nBut Jimmy got the newspaper anyway. Captain Simmons had a keen insight\ninto tomboy psychology, and from the bridge of the _Natchez Belle_ he\ncould see that Pigtail was making life miserable for Jimmy.\n\nTrue--Jimmy had no respect for packet boats and deserved a good\ntrouncing. But what a scrapper the lad was! Never let it be said that in\na struggle between the sexes the men of the river did not stand shoulder\nto shoulder.\n\nThe paper came sailing over the shining brown water like a white-bellied\nbuffalo cat shot from a sling.\n\nPigtail grabbed it before Jimmy could give her a shove. Calmly she\nunwrapped it, her chin tilted in bellicose defiance.\n\nAs the _Natchez Belle_ dwindled around a lazy, cypress-shadowed bend\nPigtail Anne became a superior being, wrapped in a cosmopolitan aura. A\nwide-eyed little girl on a swaying deck, the great outside world rushing\nstraight toward her from all directions.\n\nPigtail could take that world in her stride. She liked the fashion page\nbest, but she was not above clicking her tongue at everything in the\npaper.\n\n\"Kidnap plot linked to airliner crash killing fifty,\" she read. \"Red Sox\nblank Yanks! Congress sits today, vowing vengeance! Million dollar\nheiress elopes with a clerk! Court lets dog pick owner! Girl of eight\nkills her brother in accidental shooting!\"\n\n\"I ought to push your face right down in the mud,\" Jimmy muttered.\n\n\"Don't you dare! I've a right to see what's going on in the world!\"\n\n\"You said the paper was for Uncle Al!\"\n\n\"It is--when I get finished with it.\"\n\nJimmy started to take hold of his sister's wrist and pry the paper from\nher clasp. Only started--for as Pigtail wriggled back sunlight fell on a\nshadowed part of the paper which drew Jimmy's gaze as sunlight draws\ndew.\n\n_Exciting_ wasn't the word for the headline. It seemed to blaze out of\nthe page at Jimmy as he stared, his chin nudging Pigtail's shoulder.\n\n\n                       NEW FLYING MONSTER REPORTED\n                        BLAZING GULF STATE SKIES\n\n\nJimmy snatched the paper and backed away from Pigtail, his eyes glued to\nthe headline.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was kind to his sister, however. He read the news item aloud, if an\naccount so startling could be called an item. To Jimmy it seemed more\nlike a dazzling burst of light in the sky.\n\n\"A New Orleans resident reported today that he saw a big bright object\n'roundish like a disk' flying north, against the wind. 'It was all\nlighted up from inside!' the observer stated. 'As far as I could tell\nthere were no signs of life aboard the thing. It was much bigger than\nany of the flying saucers previously reported!'\"\n\n\"People keep seeing them!\" Jimmy muttered, after a pause. \"Nobody knows\nwhere they come from! Saucers flying through the sky, high up at night.\nIn the daytime, too! Maybe we're being _watched_, Pigtail!\"\n\n\"Watched? Jimmy, what do you mean? What you talking about?\"\n\nJimmy stared at his sister, the paper jiggling in his clasp. \"It's way\nover your head, Pigtail!\" he said sympathetically. \"I'll prove it!\nWhat's a planet?\"\n\n\"A star in the sky, you dope!\" Pigtail almost screamed. \"Wait'll Uncle\nAl hears what a meanie you are. If I wasn't your sister you wouldn't\ndare grab a paper that doesn't belong to you.\"\n\nJimmy refused to be enraged. \"A planet's not a star, Pigtail,\" he said\npatiently. \"A star's a big ball of fire like the sun. A planet is small\nand cool, like the Earth. Some of the planets may even have people on\nthem. Not people like us, but people all the same. Maybe we're just\nfrogs to them!\"\n\n\"You're crazy, Jimmy! Crazy, crazy, you hear?\"\n\nJimmy started to reply, then shut his mouth tight. Big waves were\nnothing new in the wake of steamboats, but the shantyboat wasn't just\nriding a swell. It was swaying and rocking like a floating barrel in the\nkind of blow Shantyboaters dreaded worse than the thought of dying.\n\nJimmy knew that a big blow could come up fast. Straight down from the\nsky in gusts, from all directions, banging against the boat like a\ndrunken roustabout, slamming doors, tearing away mooring planks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe river could rise fast too. Under the lashing of a hurricane blowing\nup from the gulf the river could lift a shantyboat right out of the\nwater, and smash it to smithereens against a tree.\n\nBut now the blow was coming from just one part of the sky. A funnel of\nwind was churning the river into a white froth and raising big swells\ndirectly offshore. But the river wasn't rising and the sun was shining\nin a clear sky.\n\nJimmy knew a dangerous floodwater storm when he saw one. The sky had to\nbe dark with rain, and you had to feel scared, in fear of drowning.\n\nJimmy was scared, all right. That part of it rang true. But a hollow,\nsick feeling in his chest couldn't mean anything by itself, he told\nhimself fiercely.\n\nPigtail Anne saw the disk before Jimmy did. She screamed and pointed\nskyward, her twin braids standing straight out in the wind like the\nropes on a bale of cotton, when smokestacks collapse and a savage\nhowling sends the river ghosts scurrying for cover.\n\nStraight down out of the sky the disk swooped, a huge, spinning shape\nas flat as a buckwheat cake swimming in a golden haze of butterfat.\n\nBut the disk didn't remind Jimmy of a buckwheat cake. It made him think\ninstead of a slowly turning wheel in the pilot house of a rotting old\nriverboat, a big, ghostly wheel manned by a steersman a century dead,\nhis eye sockets filled with flickering swamp lights.\n\nIt made Jimmy want to run and hide. Almost it made him want to cling to\nhis sister, content to let her wear the pants if only he could be spared\nthe horror.\n\nFor there was something so chilling about the downsweeping disk that\nJimmy's heart began leaping like a vinegar jug bobbing about in the wake\nof a capsizing fishboat.\n\nLower and lower the disk swept, trailing plumes of white smoke, lashing\nthe water with a fearful blow. Straight down over the cypress wilderness\nthat fringed the opposite bank, and then out across the river with a\nlong-drawn whistling sound, louder than the air-sucking death gasps of a\nthousand buffalo cats.\n\nJimmy didn't see the disk strike the shining broad shoulders of the\nFather of Waters, for the bend around which the _Natchez Belle_ had\nsteamed so proudly hid the sky monster from view. But Jimmy did see the\nwaterspout, spiraling skyward like the atom bomb explosion he'd goggled\nat in the pages of an old _Life_ magazine, all smudged now with oily\nthumbprints.\n\nJust a roaring for an instant--and a big white mushroom shooting\nstraight up into the sky. Then, slowly, the mushroom decayed and fell\nback, and an awful stillness settled down over the river.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe stillness was broken by a shrill cry from Pigtail Anne. \"It was a\nflying saucer! Jimmy, we've seen one! We've seen one! We've--\"\n\n\"Shut your mouth, Pigtail!\"\n\nJimmy shaded his eyes and stared out across the river, his chest a\nthrobbing ache.\n\nHe was still staring when a door creaked behind him.\n\nJimmy trembled. A tingling fear went through him, for he found it hard\nto realize that the disk had swept around the bend out of sight. To his\noverheated imagination it continued to fill all of the sky above him,\novershadowing the shantyboat, making every sound a threat.\n\nSucking the still air deep into his lungs, Jimmy swung about.\n\nUncle Al was standing on the deck in a little pool of sunlight, his\ngaunt, hollow-cheeked face set in harsh lines. Uncle Al was shading his\neyes too. But he was staring up the river, not down.\n\n\"Trouble, young fella,\" he grunted. \"Sure as I'm a-standin' here. A\nbarrelful o' trouble--headin' straight for us!\"\n\nJimmy gulped and gestured wildly toward the bend. \"It came down _over\nthere_, Uncle Al!\" he got out. \"Pigtail saw it, too! A big, flying--\"\n\n\"The Harmons are a-comin', young fella,\" Uncle Al drawled, silencing\nJimmy with a wave of his hand. \"Yesterday I rowed over a Harmon jug line\nwithout meanin' to. Now Jed Harmon's tellin' everybody I stole his\nfish!\"\n\nVery calmly Uncle Al cut himself a slice of the strongest tobacco on the\nriver and packed it carefully in his pipe, wadding it down with his\nthumb.\n\nHe started to put the pipe between his teeth, then thought better of it.\n\n\"I can bone-feel the Harmon boat a-comin', young fella,\" he said, using\nthe pipe to gesture with. \"Smooth and quiet over the river like a\nmoccasin snake.\"\n\nJimmy turned pale. He forgot about the disk and the mushrooming water\nspout. When he shut his eyes he saw only a red haze overhanging the\nriver, and a shantyboat nosing out of the cypresses, its windows\nspitting death.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJimmy knew that the Harmons had waited a long time for an excuse. The\nHarmons were law-respecting river rats with sharp teeth. Feuding wasn't\nlawful, but murder could be made lawful by whittling down a lie until it\nlooked as sharp as the truth.\n\nThe Harmon brothers would do their whittling down with double-barreled\nshotguns. It was easy enough to make murder look like a lawful crime if\nyou could point to a body covered by a blanket and say, \"We caught him\nstealing our fish! He was a-goin' to kill us--so we got him first.\"\n\nNo one would think of lifting the blanket and asking Uncle Al about it.\nA man lying stiff and still under a blanket could no more make himself\nheard than a river cat frozen in the ice.\n\n\"Git inside, young 'uns. _Here they come!_\"\n\nJimmy's heart skipped a beat. Down the river in the sunlight a\nshantyboat was drifting. Jimmy could see the Harmon brothers crouching\non the deck, their faces livid with hate, sunlight glinting on their\narm-cradled shotguns.\n\nThe Harmon brothers were not in the least alike. Jed Harmon was tall and\ngaunt, his right cheek puckered by a knife scar, his cruel, thin-lipped\nmouth snagged by his teeth. Joe Harmon was small and stout, a little\nround man with bushy eyebrows and the flabby face of a cottonmouth\nsnake.\n\n\"Go inside, Pigtail,\" Jimmy said, calmly. \"I'm a-going to stay and\nfight!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUncle Al grabbed Jimmy's arm and swung him around. \"You heard what I\nsaid, young fella. Now git!\"\n\n\"I want to stay here and fight with you, Uncle Al,\" Jimmy said.\n\n\"Have you got a gun? Do you want to be blown apart, young fella?\"\n\n\"I'm not scared, Uncle Al,\" Jimmy pleaded. \"You might get wounded. I\nknow how to shoot straight, Uncle Al. If you get hurt I'll go right on\nfighting!\"\n\n\"No you won't, young fella! Take Pigtail inside. You hear me? You want\nme to take you across my knee and beat the livin' stuffings out of you?\"\n\nSilence.\n\nDeep in his uncle's face Jimmy saw an anger he couldn't buck. Grabbing\nPigtail Anne by the arm, he propelled her across the deck and into the\ndismal front room of the shantyboat.\n\nThe instant he released her she glared at him and stamped her foot. \"If\nUncle Al gets shot it'll be your fault,\" she said cruelly. Then\nPigtail's anger really flared up.\n\n\"The Harmons wouldn't dare shoot us 'cause we're children!\"\n\nFor an instant brief as a dropped heartbeat Jimmy stared at his sister\nwith unconcealed admiration.\n\n\"You can be right smart when you've got nothing else on your mind,\nPigtail,\" he said. \"If they kill me they'll hang sure as shooting!\"\n\nJimmy was out in the sunlight again before Pigtail could make a grab for\nhim.\n\nOut on the deck and running along the deck toward Uncle Al. He was still\nrunning when the first blast came.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt didn't sound like a shotgun blast. The deck shook and a big swirl of\nsmoke floated straight toward Jimmy, half blinding him and blotting\nUncle Al from view.\n\nWhen the smoke cleared Jimmy could see the Harmon shantyboat. It was\nless than thirty feet away now, drifting straight past and rocking with\nthe tide like a topheavy flatbarge.\n\nOn the deck Jed Harmon was crouching down, his gaunt face split in a\ntriumphant smirk. Beside him Joe Harmon stood quivering like a mound of\njelly, a stick of dynamite in his hand, his flabby face looking almost\ngentle in the slanting sunlight.\n\nThere was a little square box at Jed Harmon's feet. As Joe pitched Jed\nreached into the box for another dynamite stick. Jed was passing the\nsticks along to his brother, depending on wad dynamite to silence Uncle\nAl forever.\n\nWildly Jimmy told himself that the guns had been just a trick to mix\nUncle Al up, and keep him from shooting until they had him where they\nwanted him.\n\nUncle Al was shooting now, his face as grim as death. His big heavy gun\nwas leaping about like mad, almost hurling him to the deck.\n\nJimmy saw the second dynamite stick spinning through the air, but he\nnever saw it come down. All he could see was the smoke and the\nshantyboat rocking, and another terrible splintering crash as he went\nplunging into the river from the end of a rising plank, a sob strangling\nin his throat.\n\nJimmy struggled up from the river with the long leg-thrusts of a\nterrified bullfrog, his head a throbbing ache. As he swam shoreward he\ncould see the cypresses on the opposite bank, dark against the sun, and\nsomething that looked like the roof of a house with water washing over\nit.\n\nThen, with mud sucking at his heels, Jimmy was clinging to a slippery\nbank and staring out across the river, shading his eyes against the\nglare.\n\nJimmy thought, \"I'm dreaming! I'll wake up and see Uncle Joe blowing on\na vinegar jug. I'll see Pigtail, too. Uncle Al will be sitting on the\ndeck, taking it easy!\"\n\nBut Uncle Al wasn't sitting on the deck. There was no deck for Uncle Al\nto sit upon. Just the top of the shantyboat, sinking lower and lower,\nand Uncle Al swimming.\n\nUncle Al had his arm around Pigtail, and Jimmy could see Pigtail's white\nface bobbing up and down as Uncle Al breasted the tide with his strong\nright arm.\n\nCloser to the bend was the Harmon shantyboat. The Harmons were using\ntheir shotguns now, blasting fiercely away at Uncle Al and Pigtail.\nJimmy could see the smoke curling up from the leaping guns and the water\njumping up and down in little spurts all about Uncle Al.\n\nThere was an awful hollow agony in Jimmy's chest as he stared, a fear\nthat was partly a soundless screaming and partly a vision of Uncle Al\nsinking down through the dark water and turning it red.\n\nIt was strange, though. Something was happening to Jimmy, nibbling away\nat the outer edges of the fear like a big, hungry river cat. Making the\nfear seem less swollen and awful, shredding it away in little flakes.\n\nThere was a white core of anger in Jimmy which seemed suddenly to blaze\nup.\n\nHe shut his eyes tight.\n\nIn his mind's gaze Jimmy saw himself holding the Harmon brothers up by\ntheir long, mottled legs. The Harmon brothers were frogs. Not friendly,\ngood natured frogs like Uncle Al, but snake frogs. Cottonmouth frogs.\n\nAll flannel red were their mouths, and they had long evil fangs which\ndripped poison in the sunlight. But Jimmy wasn't afraid of them no-ways.\nNot any more. He had too firm a grip on their legs.\n\n\"Don't let anything happen to Uncle Al and Pigtail!\" Jimmy whispered, as\nthough he were talking to himself. No--not exactly to himself. To\nsomeone like himself, only larger. Very close to Jimmy, but larger, more\npowerful.\n\n\"Catch them before they harm Uncle Al! Hurry! _Hurry!_\"\n\nThere was a strange lifting sensation in Jimmy's chest now. As though he\ncould shake the river if he tried hard enough, tilt it, send it swirling\nin great thunderous white surges clear down to Lake Pontchartrain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Jimmy didn't want to tilt the river. Not with Uncle Al on it and\nPigtail, and all those people in New Orleans who would disappear right\noff the streets. They were frogs too, maybe, but good frogs. Not like\nthe Harmon brothers.\n\nJimmy had a funny picture of himself much younger than he was. Jimmy saw\nhimself as a great husky baby, standing in the middle of the river and\nblowing on it with all his might. The waves rose and rose, and Jimmy's\ncheeks swelled out and the river kept getting angrier.\n\nNo--he must fight that.\n\n\"Save Uncle Al!\" he whispered fiercely. \"Just save him--and Pigtail!\"\n\nIt began to happen the instant Jimmy opened his eyes. Around the bend in\nthe sunlight came a great spinning disk, wrapped in a fiery glow.\n\nStraight toward the Harmon shantyboat the disk swept, water spurting up\nall about it, its bottom fifty feet wide. There was no collision. Only a\nbrightness for one awful instant where the shantyboat was twisting and\nturning in the current, a brightness that outshone the rising sun.\n\nJust like a camera flashbulb going off, but bigger, brighter. So big and\nbright that Jimmy could see the faces of the Harmon brothers fifty times\nas large as life, shriveling and disappearing in a magnifying burst of\nflame high above the cypress trees. Just as though a giant in the sky\nhad trained a big burning glass on the Harmon brothers and whipped it\nback quick.\n\nWhipped it straight up, so that the faces would grow huge before\ndissolving as a warning to all snakes. There was an evil anguish in the\ndissolving faces which made Jimmy's blood run cold. Then the disk was\nalone in the middle of the river, spinning around and around, the\nshantyboat swallowed up.\n\nAnd Uncle Al was still swimming, fearfully close to it.\n\nThe net came swirling out of the disk over Uncle Al like a great,\ndew-drenched gossamer web. It enmeshed him as he swam, so gently that he\nhardly seemed to struggle or even to be aware of what was happening to\nhim.\n\nPigtail didn't resist, either. She simply stopped thrashing in Uncle\nAl's arms, as though a great wonder had come upon her.\n\nSlowly Uncle Al and Pigtail were drawn into the disk. Jimmy could see\nUncle Al reclining in the web, with Pigtail in the crook of his arm, his\nlong, angular body as quiet as a butterfly in its deep winter sleep\ninside a swaying glass cocoon.\n\nUncle Al and Pigtail, being drawn together into the disk as Jimmy\nstared, a dull pounding in his chest. After a moment the pounding\nsubsided and a silence settled down over the river.\n\nJimmy sucked in his breath. The voices began quietly, as though they had\nbeen waiting for a long time to speak to Jimmy deep inside his head, and\ndidn't want to frighten him in any way.\n\n\"Take it easy, Jimmy! Stay where you are. We're just going to have a\nfriendly little talk with Uncle Al.\"\n\n\"A t-talk?\" Jimmy heard himself stammering.\n\n\"We knew we'd find you where life flows simply and serenely, Jimmy.\nYour parents took care of that before they left you with Uncle Al.\n\n\"You see, Jimmy, we wanted you to study the Earth people on a great,\nwide flowing river, far from the cruel, twisted places. To grow up with\nthem, Jimmy--and to understand them. Especially the Uncle Als. For Uncle\nAl is unspoiled, Jimmy. If there's any hope at all for Earth as we guide\nand watch it, that hope burns most brightly in the Uncle Als!\"\n\nThe voice paused, then went on quickly. \"You see, Jimmy, you're not\nhuman in the same way that your sister is human--or Uncle Al. But you're\nstill young enough to feel human, and we want you to feel human, Jimmy.\"\n\n\"W--Who are you?\" Jimmy gasped.\n\n\"We are the Shining Ones, Jimmy! For wide wastes of years we have\ncruised Earth's skies, almost unnoticed by the Earth people. When\ndarkness wraps the Earth in a great, spinning shroud we hide our ships\nclose to the cities, and glide through the silent streets in search of\nour young. You see, Jimmy, we must watch and protect the young of our\nrace until sturdiness comes upon them, and they are ready for the Great\nChange.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor an instant there was a strange, humming sound deep inside Jimmy's\nhead, like the drowsy murmur of bees in a dew-drenched clover patch.\nThen the voice droned on. \"The Earth people are frightened by our ships\nnow, for their cruel wars have put a great fear of death in their\nhearts. They watch the skies with sharper eyes, and their minds have\ngroped closer to the truth.\n\n\"To the Earth people our ships are no longer the fireballs of mysterious\nlegend, haunted will-o'-the-wisps, marsh flickerings and the even more\nillusive distortions of the sick in mind. It is a long bold step from\nfireballs to flying saucers, Jimmy. A day will come when the Earth\npeople will be wise enough to put aside fear. Then we can show ourselves\nto them as we really are, and help them openly.\"\n\nThe voice seemed to take more complete possession of Jimmy's thoughts\nthen, growing louder and more eager, echoing through his mind with the\npersuasiveness of muted chimes.\n\n\"Jimmy, close your eyes tight. We're going to take you across wide gulfs\nof space to the bright and shining land of your birth.\"\n\nJimmy obeyed.\n\nIt was a city, and yet it wasn't like New York or Chicago or any of the\nother cities Jimmy had seen illustrations of in the newspapers and\npicture magazines.\n\nThe buildings were white and domed and shining, and they seemed to tower\nstraight up into the sky. There were streets, too, weaving in and out\nbetween the domes like rainbow-colored spider webs in a forest of\nmushrooms.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were no people in the city, but down the aerial streets shining\nobjects swirled with the swift easy gliding of flat stones skimming an\nedge of running water.\n\nThen as Jimmy stared into the depths of the strange glow behind his\neyelids the city dwindled and fell away, and he saw a huge circular disk\nlooming in a wilderness of shadows. Straight toward the disk a shining\nobject moved, bearing aloft on filaments of flame a much smaller object\nthat struggled and mewed and reached out little white arms.\n\nCloser and closer the shining object came, until Jimmy could see that it\nwas carrying a human infant that stared straight at Jimmy out of wide,\ndark eyes. But before he could get a really good look at the shining\nobject it pierced the shadows and passed into the disk.\n\nThere was a sudden, blinding burst of light, and the disk was gone.\n\nJimmy opened his eyes.\n\n\"You were once like that baby, Jimmy!\" the voice said. \"You were carried\nby your parents into a waiting ship, and then out across wide gulfs of\nspace to Earth.\n\n\"You see, Jimmy, our race was once entirely human. But as we grew to\nmaturity we left the warm little worlds where our infancy was spent,\nand boldly sought the stars, shedding our humanness as sunlight sheds\nthe dew, or a bright, soaring moth of the night its ugly pupa case.\n\n\"We grew great and wise, Jimmy, but not quite wise enough to shed our\nhuman heritage of love and joy and heartbreak. In our childhood we must\nreturn to the scenes of our past, to take root again in familiar soil,\nto grow in power and wisdom slowly and sturdily, like a seed dropped\nback into the loam which nourished the great flowering mother plant.\n\n\"Or like the eel of Earth's seas, Jimmy, that must be spawned in the\ndepths of the great cold ocean, and swim slowly back to the bright\nhighlands and the shining rivers of Earth. Young eels do not resemble\ntheir parents, Jimmy. They're white and thin and transparent and have to\nstruggle hard to survive and grow up.\n\n\"Jimmy, you were planted here by your parents to grow wise and strong.\nDeep in your mind you knew that we had come to seek you out, for we are\nall born human, and are bound one to another by that knowledge, and that\nsecret trust.\n\n\"You knew that we would watch over you and see that no harm would come\nto you. You called out to us, Jimmy, with all the strength of your mind\nand heart. Your Uncle Al was in danger and you sensed our nearness.\n\n\"It was partly your knowledge that saved him, Jimmy. But it took courage\ntoo, and a willingness to believe that you were more than human, and\narmed with the great proud strength and wisdom of the Shining Ones.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe voice grew suddenly gentle, like a caressing wind.\n\n\"You're not old enough yet to go home, Jimmy! Or wise enough. We'll take\nyou home when the time comes. Now we just want to have a talk with Uncle\nAl, to find out how you're getting along.\"\n\nJimmy looked down into the river and then up into the sky. Deep down\nunder the dark, swirling water he could see life taking shape in a\nthousand forms. Caddis flies building bright, shining new nests, and\ndragonfly nymphs crawling up toward the sunlight, and pollywogs growing\nsturdy hindlimbs to conquer the land.\n\nBut there were cottonmouths down there too, with death behind their\nfangs, and no love for the life that was crawling upward. When Jimmy\nlooked up into the sky he could see all the blazing stars of space, with\ncottonmouths on every planet of every sun.\n\nUncle Al was like a bright caddis fly building a fine new nest, thatched\nwith kindness, denying himself bright little Mardi Gras pleasures so\nthat Jimmy could go to school and grow wiser than Uncle Al.\n\n\"That's right, Jimmy. You're growing up--we can see that! Uncle Al says\nhe told you to bide from the cottonmouths. But you were ready to give\nyour life for your sister and Uncle Al.\"\n\n\"Shucks, it was nothing!\" Jimmy heard himself protesting.\n\n\"Uncle Al doesn't think so. And neither do we!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA long silence while the river mists seemed to weave a bright cocoon of\nradiance about Jimmy clinging to the bank, and the great circular disk\nthat had swallowed up Uncle Al.\n\nThen the voices began again. \"No reason why Uncle Al shouldn't have a\nlittle fun out of life, Jimmy. Gold's easy to make and we'll make some\nright now. A big lump of gold in Uncle Al's hand won't hurt him in any\nway.\"\n\n\"Whenever he gets any spending money he gives it away!\" Jimmy gulped.\n\n\"I know, Jimmy. But he'll listen to you. Tell him you want to go to New\nOrleans, too!\"\n\nJimmy looked up quickly then. In his heart was something of the wonder\nhe'd felt when he'd seen his first riverboat and waited for he knew not\nwhat. Something of the wonder that must have come to men seeking magic\nin the sky, the rainmakers of ancient tribes and of days long vanished.\n\nOnly to Jimmy the wonder came now with a white burst of remembrance and\nrecognition.\n\nIt was as though he could sense something of himself in the two towering\nspheres that rose straight up out of the water behind the disk. Still\nand white and beautiful they were, like bubbles floating on a rainbow\nsea with all the stars of space behind them.\n\nStaring at them, Jimmy saw himself as he would be, and knew himself for\nwhat he was. It was not a glory to be long endured.\n\n\"Now you must forget again, Jimmy! Forget as Uncle Al will forget--until\nwe come for you. Be a little shantyboat boy! You are safe on the wide\nbosom of the Father of Waters. Your parents planted you in a rich and\nkindly loam, and in all the finite universes you will find no cosier\nnook, for life flows here with a diversity that is infinite\nand--_Pigtail_! She gets on your nerves at times, doesn't she, Jimmy?\"\n\n\"She sure does,\" Jimmy admitted.\n\n\"Be patient with her, Jimmy. She's the only human sister you'll ever\nhave on Earth.\"\n\n\"I--I'll try!\" Jimmy muttered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUncle Al and Pigtail came out of the disk in an amazingly simple way.\nThey just seemed to float out, in the glimmering web. Then, suddenly,\nthere wasn't any disk on the river at all--just a dull flickering where\nthe sky had opened like a great, blazing furnace to swallow it up.\n\n\"I was just swimmin' along with Pigtail, not worryin' too much, 'cause\nthere's no sense in worryin' when death is starin' you in the face,\"\nUncle Al muttered, a few minutes later.\n\nUncle Al sat on the riverbank beside Jimmy, staring down at his palm,\nhis vision misted a little by a furious blinking.\n\n\"It's gold, Uncle Al!\" Pigtail shrilled. \"A big lump of solid gold--\"\n\n\"I just felt my hand get heavy and there it was, young fella, nestling\nthere in my palm!\"\n\nJimmy didn't seem to be able to say anything.\n\n\"High school books don't cost no more than grammar school books, young\nfella,\" Uncle Al said, his face a sudden shining. \"Next winter you'll be\na-goin' to high school, sure as I'm a-sittin' here!\"\n\nFor a moment the sunlight seemed to blaze so brightly about Uncle Al\nthat Jimmy couldn't even see the holes in his socks.\n\nThen Uncle Al made a wry face. \"Someday, young fella, when your books\nare all paid for, I'm gonna buy myself a brand new store suit, and hie\nmyself off to the Mardi Gras. Ain't too old thataway to git a little fun\nout of life, young fella!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTranscriber's Note: The following typographical errors in the original\ntext have been corrected in this eBook:\n\nPage 31: \"sunilght\" changed to \"sunlight\"\n\nPage 32: \"tie\" changed to \"tide\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Mississippi Saucer, by Frank Belknap Long\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MISSISSIPPI SAUCER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 23568.txt or 23568.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/3/5/6/23568/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Joel Schlosberg and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
