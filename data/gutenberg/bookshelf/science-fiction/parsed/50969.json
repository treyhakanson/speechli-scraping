L. WALLACE\n\n                          Illustrated by EMSH\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                 Galaxy Science Fiction November 1954.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n      Man's family tree was awesome enough to give every galactic\n      race an inferiority complex--but then he tried to climb it!\n\n\nIn repose, Taphetta the Ribboneer resembled a fancy giant bow on a\npackage. His four flat legs looped out and in, the ends tucked under\nhis wide, thin body, which constituted the knot at the middle. His neck\nwas flat, too, arching out in another loop. Of all his features, only\nhis head had appreciable thickness and it was crowned with a dozen long\nthough narrower ribbons.\n\nTaphetta rattled the head fronds together in a surprisingly good\nimitation of speech. \"Yes, I've heard the legend.\"\n\n\"It's more than a legend,\" said Sam Halden, biologist. The reaction was\nnot unexpected--non-humans tended to dismiss the data as convenient\nspeculation and nothing more. \"There are at least a hundred kinds of\nhumans, each supposedly originating in strict seclusion on as many\nwidely scattered planets. Obviously there was no contact throughout the\nages before space travel--_and yet each planetary race can interbreed\nwith a minimum of ten others_! That's more than a legend--one hell of a\nlot more!\"\n\n\"It is impressive,\" admitted Taphetta. \"But I find it mildly\ndistasteful to consider mating with someone who does not belong to my\nspecies.\"\n\n\"That's because you're unique,\" said Halden. \"Outside of your own\nworld, there's nothing like your species, except superficially, and\nthat's true of all other creatures, intelligent or not, with the sole\nexception of mankind. Actually, the four of us here, though it's\naccidental, very nearly represent the biological spectrum of human\ndevelopment.\n\n\"Emmer, a Neanderthal type and our archeologist, is around the\nbeginning of the scale. I'm from Earth, near the middle, though on\nEmmer's side. Meredith, linguist, is on the other side of the middle.\nAnd beyond her, toward the far end, is Kelburn, mathematician. There's\na corresponding span of fertility. Emmer just misses being able to\nbreed with my kind, but there's a fair chance that I'd be fertile with\nMeredith and a similar though lesser chance that her fertility may\nextend to Kelburn.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTaphetta rustled his speech ribbons quizzically. \"But I thought it was\nproved that some humans did originate on one planet, that there was an\nunbroken line of evolution that could be traced back a billion years.\"\n\n\"You're thinking of Earth,\" said Halden. \"Humans require a certain kind\nof planet. It's reasonable to assume that, if men were set down on a\nhundred such worlds, they'd seem to fit in with native life-forms on a\nfew of them. That's what happened on Earth; when Man arrived, there was\nactually a manlike creature there. Naturally our early evolutionists\nstretched their theories to cover the facts they had.\n\n\"But there are other worlds in which humans who were there before the\nStone Age aren't related to anything else there. We have to conclude\nthat Man didn't originate on any of the planets on which he is now\nfound. Instead, he evolved elsewhere and later was scattered throughout\nthis section of the Milky Way.\"\n\n\"And so, to account for the unique race that can interbreed across\nthousands of light-years, you've brought in the big ancestor,\"\ncommented Taphetta dryly. \"It seems an unnecessary simplification.\"\n\n\"Can you think of a better explanation?\" asked Kelburn.\n\n\"Something had to distribute one species so widely and it's not the\nresult of parallel evolution--not when a hundred human races are\ninvolved, and _only_ the human race.\"\n\n\"I can't think of a better explanation.\" Taphetta rearranged his\nribbons. \"Frankly, no one else is much interested in Man's theories\nabout himself.\"\n\nIt was easy to understand the attitude. Man was the most numerous\nthough not always the most advanced--Ribboneers had a civilization as\nhigh as anything in the known section of the Milky Way, and there were\nothers--and humans were more than a little feared. If they ever got\ntogether--but they hadn't except in agreement as to their common origin.\n\nStill, Taphetta the Ribboneer was an experienced pilot and could be\nvery useful. A clear statement of their position was essential in\nhelping him make up his mind. \"You've heard of the adjacency mating\nprinciple?\" asked Sam Halden.\n\n\"Vaguely. Most people have if they've been around men.\"\n\n\"We've got new data and are able to interpret it better. The theory is\nthat humans who can mate with each other were once physically close.\nWe've got a list of all our races arranged in sequence. If planetary\nrace F can mate with race E back to A and forward to M, and race G is\nfertile only back to B, but forward to O, then we assume that whatever\ntheir positions are now, at once time G was actually adjacent to F, but\nwas a little further along. When we project back into time those star\nsystems on which humans existed prior to space travel, we get a certain\npattern. Kelburn can explain it to you.\"\n\nThe normally pink body of the Ribboneer flushed slightly. The color\nchange was almost imperceptible, but it was enough to indicate that he\nwas interested.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKelburn went to the projector. \"It would be easier if we knew all the\nstars in the Milky Way, but though we've explored only a small portion\nof it, we can reconstruct a fairly accurate representation of the past.\"\n\nHe pressed the controls and stars twinkled on the screen. \"We're\nlooking down on the plane of the Galaxy. This is one arm of it as it is\ntoday and here are the human systems.\" He pressed another control and,\nfor purposes of identification, certain stars became more brilliant.\nThere was no pattern, merely a scattering of stars. \"The whole Milky\nWay is rotating. And while stars in a given region tend to remain\ntogether, there's also a random motion. Here's what happens when we\ncalculate the positions of stars in the past.\"\n\nFlecks of light shifted and flowed across the screen. Kelburn stopped\nthe motion.\n\n\"Two hundred thousand years ago,\" he said.\n\nThere was a pattern of the identified stars. They were spaced at fairly\nequal intervals along a regular curve, a horseshoe loop that didn't\nclose, though if the ends were extended, the lines would have crossed.\n\nTaphetta rustled. \"The math is accurate?\"\n\n\"As accurate as it can be with a million-plus body problem.\"\n\n\"And that's the hypothetical route of the unknown ancestor?\"\n\n\"To the best of our knowledge,\" said Kelburn. \"And whereas there are\nhumans who are relatively near and not fertile, they can always mate\nwith those they were adjacent to _two hundred thousand years ago_!\"\n\n\"The adjacency mating principle. I've never seen it demonstrated,\"\nmurmured Taphetta, flexing his ribbons. \"Is that the only era that\nsatisfies the calculations?\"\n\n\"Plus or minus a hundred thousand years, we can still get something\nthat might be the path of a spaceship attempting to cover a\nrepresentative section of territory,\" said Kelburn. \"However, we have\nother ways of dating it. On some worlds on which there are no other\nmammals, we're able to place the first human fossils chronologically.\nThe evidence is sometimes contradictory, but we believe we've got the\ntime right.\"\n\nTaphetta waved a ribbon at the chart. \"And you think that where the two\nends of the curve cross is your original home?\"\n\n\"We think so,\" said Kelburn. \"We've narrowed it down to several cubic\nlight-years--then. Now it's far more. And, of course, if it were a\nfast-moving star, it might be completely out of the field of our\nexploration. But we're certain we've got a good chance of finding it\nthis trip.\"\n\n\"It seems I must decide quickly.\" The Ribboneer glanced out the\nvisionport, where another ship hung motionless in space beside them.\n\"Do you mind if I ask other questions?\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Kelburn invited sardonically. \"But if it's not math, you'd\nbetter ask Halden. He's the leader of the expedition.\"\n\nHalden flushed; the sarcasm wasn't necessary. It was true that Kelburn\nwas the most advanced human type present, but while there were\ndifferences, biological and in the scale of intelligence, it wasn't\nas great as once was thought. Anyway, non-humans weren't trained in\nthe fine distinctions that men made among themselves. And, higher or\nlower, he was as good a biologist as the other was a mathematician. And\nthere was the matter of training; he'd been on several expeditions and\nthis was Kelburn's first trip. Damn it, he thought, that rated some\nrespect.\n\nThe Ribboneer shifted his attention. \"Aside from the sudden illness of\nyour pilot, why did you ask for me?\"\n\n\"We didn't. The man became sick and required treatment we can't give\nhim. Luckily, a ship was passing and we hailed it because it's four\nmonths to the nearest planet. They consented to take him back and told\nus that there was a passenger on board who was an experienced pilot. We\nhave men who could do the job in a makeshift fashion, but the region\nwe're heading for, while mapped, is largely unknown. We'd prefer to\nhave an expert--and Ribboneers are famous for their navigational\nability.\"\n\nTaphetta crinkled politely at the reference to his skill. \"I had other\nplans, but I can't evade professional obligations, and an emergency\nsuch as this should cancel out any previous agreements. Still, what are\nthe incentives?\"\n\nSam Halden coughed. \"The usual, plus a little extra. We've copied the\nRibboneer's standard nature, simplifying it a little and adding a per\ncent here and there for the crew pilot and scientist's share of the\nprofits from any discoveries we may make.\"\n\n\"I'm complimented that you like our contract so well,\" said Taphetta,\n\"but I really must have our own unsimplified version. If you want me,\nyou'll take my contract. I came prepared.\" He extended a tightly bound\nroll that he had kept somewhere on his person.\n\nThey glanced at one another as Halden took it.\n\n\"You can read it if you want,\" offered Taphetta. \"But it will take\nyou all day--it's micro-printing. However, you needn't be afraid that\nI'm defrauding you. It's honored everywhere we go and we go nearly\neverywhere in this sector--places men have never been.\"\n\nThere was no choice if they wanted him, and they did. Besides, the\nintegrity of Ribboneers was not to be questioned. Halden signed.\n\n\"Good.\" Taphetta crinkled. \"Send it to the ship; they'll forward it\nfor me. And you can tell the ship to go on without me.\" He rubbed his\nribbons together. \"Now if you'll get me the charts, I'll examine the\nregion toward which we're heading.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFirmon of hydroponics slouched in, a tall man with scanty hair and\nan equal lack of grace. He seemed to have difficulty in taking his\neyes off Meredith, though, since he was a notch or so above her in the\nmating scale, he shouldn't have been so interested. But his planet had\nbeen inexplicably slow in developing and he wasn't completely aware of\nhis place in the human hierarchy.\n\nDisdainfully, Meredith adjusted a skirt that, a few inches shorter,\nwouldn't have been a skirt at all, revealing, while doing so, just how\nlong and beautiful a woman's legs could be. Her people had never given\nmuch thought to physical modesty and, with legs like that, it was easy\nto see why.\n\nMuttering something about primitive women, Firmon turned to the\nbiologist. \"The pilot doesn't like our air.\"\n\n\"Then change it to suit him. He's in charge of the ship and knows more\nabout these things than I do.\"\n\n\"More than a man?\" Firmon leered at Meredith and, when she failed\nto smile, added plaintively, \"I did try to change it, but he still\ncomplains.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalden took a deep breath. \"Seems all right to me.\"\n\n\"To everybody else, too, but the tapeworm hasn't got lungs. He breathes\nthrough a million tubes scattered over his body.\"\n\nIt would do no good to explain that Taphetta wasn't a worm, that his\nevolution had taken a different course, but that he was in no sense\nless complex than Man. It was a paradox that some biologically higher\nhumans hadn't developed as much as lower races and actually weren't\nprepared for the multitude of life-forms they'd meet in space. Firmon's\nreaction was quite typical.\n\n\"If he asks for cleaner air, it's because his system needs it,\" said\nHalden. \"Do anything you can to give it to him.\"\n\n\"Can't. This is as good as I can get it. Taphetta thought you could do\nsomething about it.\"\n\n\"Hydroponics is your job. There's nothing _I_ can do.\" Halden paused\nthoughtfully. \"Is there something wrong with the plants?\"\n\n\"In a way, I guess, and yet not really.\"\n\n\"What is it, some kind of toxic condition?\"\n\n\"The plants are healthy enough, but something's chewing them down as\nfast as they grow.\"\n\n\"Insects? There shouldn't be any, but if there are, we've got sprays.\nUse them.\"\n\n\"It's an animal,\" said Firmon. \"We tried poison and got a few, but now\nthey won't touch the stuff. I had electronics rig up some traps. The\nanimals seem to know what they are and we've never caught one that\nway.\"\n\nHalden glowered at the man. \"How long has this been going on?\"\n\n\"About three months. It's not bad; we can keep up with them.\"\n\nIt was probably nothing to become alarmed at, but an animal on the ship\nwas a nuisance, doubly so because of their pilot.\n\n\"Tell me what you know about it,\" said Halden.\n\n\"They're little things.\" Firmon held out his hands to show how small.\n\"I don't know how they got on, but once they did, there were plenty of\nplaces to hide.\" He looked up defensively. \"This is an old ship with\nnew equipment and they hide under the machinery. There's nothing we can\ndo except rebuild the ship from the hull inward.\"\n\nFirmon was right. The new equipment had been installed in any place\njust to get it in and now there were inaccessible corners and crevices\neverywhere that couldn't be closed off without rebuilding.\n\nThey couldn't set up a continuous watch and shoot the animals down\nbecause there weren't that many men to spare. Besides, the use of\nweapons in hydroponics would cause more damage to the thing they were\ntrying to protect than to the pest. He'd have to devise other ways.\n\nSam Halden got up. \"I'll take a look and see what I can do.\"\n\n\"I'll come along and help,\" said Meredith, untwining her legs and\nleaning against him. \"Your mistress ought to have some sort of\nprivileges.\"\n\nHalden started. So she _knew_ that the crew was calling her that!\nPerhaps it was intended to discourage Firmon, but he wished she hadn't\nsaid it. It didn't help the situation at all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTaphetta sat in a chair designed for humans. With a less flexible body,\nhe wouldn't have fitted. Maybe it wasn't sitting, but his flat legs\nwere folded neatly around the arms and his head rested comfortably on\nthe seat. The head ribbons, which were his hands and voice, were never\nquite still.\n\nHe looked from Halden to Emmer and back again. \"The hydroponics tech\ntells me you're contemplating an experiment. I don't like it.\"\n\nHalden shrugged. \"We've got to have better air. It might work.\"\n\n\"Pests on the ship? It's filthy! My people would never tolerate it!\"\n\n\"Neither do we.\"\n\nThe Ribboneer's distaste subsided. \"What kind of creatures are they?\"\n\n\"I have a description, though I've never seen one. It's a small\nfour-legged animal with two antennae at the lower base of its skull. A\ntypical pest.\"\n\nTaphetta rustled. \"Have you found out how it got on?\"\n\n\"It was probably brought in with the supplies,\" said the biologist.\n\"Considering how far we've come, it may have been any one of a half\na dozen planets. Anyway, it hid, and since most of the places it had\naccess to were near the outer hull, it got an extra dose of hard\nradiation, or it may have nested near the atomic engines; both are\npossibilities. Either way, it mutated, became a different animal. It's\ndeveloped a tolerance for the poisons we spray on plants. Other things\nit detects and avoids, even electronic traps.\"\n\n\"Then you believe it changed mentally as well as physically, that it's\nsmarter?\"\n\n\"I'd say that, yes. It must be a fairly intelligent creature to be\nso hard to get rid of. But it can be lured into traps, if the bait's\nstrong enough.\"\n\n\"That's what I don't like,\" said Taphetta, curling. \"Let me think it\nover while I ask questions.\" He turned to Emmer. \"I'm curious about\nhumans. Is there anything else you can tell me about the hypothetical\nancestor?\"\n\nEmmer didn't look like the genius he was--a Neanderthal genius, but\nnonetheless a real one. In his field, he rated very high. He raised a\nstubble-flecked cheek from a large thick-fingered paw and ran shaggy\nhands through shaggier hair.\n\n\"I can speak with some authority,\" he rumbled. \"I was born on a world\nwith the most extensive relics. As a child, I played in the ruins of\ntheir camp.\"\n\n\"I don't question your authority,\" crinkled Taphetta. \"To me, all\nhumans--late or early and male or female--look remarkably alike. If you\nare an archeologist, that's enough for me.\" He paused and flicked his\nspeech ribbons. \"Camp, did you say?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEmmer smiled, unsheathing great teeth. \"You've never seen any pictures?\nImpressive, but just a camp, monolithic one-story structures, and\nwe'd give something to know what they're made of. Presumably my world\nwas one of the first they stopped at. They weren't used to roughing\nit, so they built more elaborately than they did later on. One-story\nstructures and that's how we can guess at their size. The doorways were\nforty feet high.\"\n\n\"Very large,\" agreed Taphetta. It was difficult to tell whether he was\nimpressed. \"What did you find in the ruins?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Emmer. \"There were buildings there and that was all,\nnot a scrap of writing or a tool or a single picture. They covered\na route estimated at thirty thousand light-years in less than five\nthousand years--and not one of them died that we have a record of.\"\n\n\"A faster-than-light drive and an extremely long life,\" mused Taphetta.\n\"But they didn't leave any information for their descendants. Why?\"\n\n\"Who knows? Their mental processes were certainly far different from\nours. They may have thought we'd be better off without it. We do know\nthey were looking for a special kind of planet, like Earth, because\nthey visited so many of that type, yet different from it because they\nnever stayed. They were pretty special people themselves, big and\nlong-lived, and maybe they couldn't survive on any planet they found.\nPerhaps they had ways of determining there wasn't the kind of planet\nthey needed in the entire Milky Way. Their science was tremendously\nadvanced and when they learned that, they may have altered their germ\nplasm and left us, hoping that some of us would survive. Most of us\ndid.\"\n\n\"This special planet sounds strange,\" murmured Taphetta.\n\n\"Not really,\" said Emmer. \"Fifty human races reached space travel\nindependently and those who did were scattered equally among early and\nlate species. It's well known that individuals among my people are\noften as bright as any of Halden's or Meredith's, but as a whole we\ndon't have the total capacity that later Man does, and yet we're as\nadvanced in civilization. The difference? It must lie somewhere in the\nplanets we live on and it's hard to say just what it is.\"\n\n\"What happened to those who didn't develop space travel?\" asked\nTaphetta.\n\n\"We helped them,\" said Emmer.\n\nAnd they had, no matter who or what they were, biologically late\nor early, in the depths of the bronze age or the threshold of\natomic--because they were human. That was sometimes a frightening thing\nfor non-humans, that the race stuck together. They weren't actually\naggressive, but their total number was great and they held themselves\naloof. The unknown ancestor again. Who else had such an origin and, it\nwas tacitly assumed, such a destiny?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTaphetta changed his questioning. \"What do you expect to gain from this\ndiscovery of the unknown ancestor?\"\n\nIt was Halden who answered him. \"There's the satisfaction of knowing\nwhere we came from.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" rustled the Ribboneer. \"But a lot of money and equipment\nwas required for this expedition. I can't believe that the educational\ninstitutions that are backing you did so purely out of intellectual\ncuriosity.\"\n\n\"Cultural discoveries,\" rumbled Emmer. \"How did our ancestors live?\nWhen a creature is greatly reduced in size, as we are, more than\nphysiology is changed--the pattern of life itself is altered. Things\nthat were easy for them are impossible for us. Look at their life span.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" said Taphetta. \"An archeologist would be interested in\ncultural discoveries.\"\n\n\"Two hundred thousand years ago, they had an extremely advanced\ncivilization,\" added Halden. \"A faster-than-light drive, and we've\nachieved that only within the last thousand years.\"\n\n\"But I think we have a better one than they did,\" said the Ribboneer.\n\"There may be things we can learn from them in mechanics or physics,\nbut wouldn't you say they were better biologists than anything else?\"\n\nHalden nodded. \"Agreed. They couldn't find a suitable planet. So,\nworking directly with their germ plasm, they modified themselves and\nproduced us. They _were_ master biologists.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" said Taphetta. \"I never paid much attention to your\nfantastic theories before I signed to pilot this ship, but you've built\nup a convincing case.\" He raised his head, speech ribbons curling\nfractionally and ceaselessly. \"I don't like to, but we'll have to risk\nusing bait for your pest.\"\n\nHe'd have done it anyway, but it was better to have the pilot's\nconsent. And there was one question Halden wanted to ask; it had been\nbothering him vaguely. \"What's the difference between the Ribboneer\ncontract and the one we offered you? Our terms are more liberal.\"\n\n\"To the individual, they are, but it won't matter if you discover as\nmuch as you think you will. The difference is this: _My_ terms don't\npermit you to withhold any discovery for the benefit of one race.\"\n\nTaphetta was wrong; there had been no intention of withholding\nanything. Halden examined his own attitudes. _He_ hadn't intended, but\ncould he say that was true of the institutions backing the expedition?\nHe couldn't, and it was too late now--whatever knowledge they acquired\nwould have to be shared.\n\nThat was what Taphetta had been afraid of--there was one kind of\ntechnical advancement that multiplied unceasingly. The race that could\nimprove itself through scientific control of its germ plasm had a start\nthat could never be headed. The Ribboneer needn't worry now.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Why do we have to watch it on the screen?\" asked Meredith, glancing\nup. \"I'd rather be in hydroponics.\"\n\nHalden shrugged. \"They may or may not be smarter than planetbound\nanimals, but they're warier. They don't come out when anyone's near.\"\n\nLights dimmed in the distant hydroponic section and the screen with\nit, until he adjusted the infra-red frequencies. He motioned to the\ntwo crew members, each with his own peculiar screen, below which was a\nminiature keyboard.\n\n\"Ready?\"\n\nWhen they nodded, Halden said: \"Do as you've rehearsed. Keep noise at\na minimum, but when you do use it, be vague. Don't try to imitate them\nexactly.\"\n\nAt first, nothing happened on the big screen, and then a gray shape\ncrept out. It slid through leaves, listened intently before coming\nforward. It jumped off one hydroponic section and fled across the open\nfloor to the next. It paused, eyes glittering and antennae twitching.\n\nLooking around once, it leaped up, seizing the ledge and clawing up the\nside of the tank. Standing on top and rising to its haunches, it began\nnibbling what it could reach.\n\nSuddenly it whirled. Behind it and hitherto unnoticed was another\nshape, like it but larger. The newcomer inched forward. The small one\nretreated, skittering nervously. Without warning, the big one leaped\nand the small one tried to flee. In a few jumps, the big one caught up\nand mauled the other unmercifully.\n\nIt continued to bite even after the little one lay still. At last it\nbacked off and waited, watching for signs of motion. There was none.\nThen it turned to the plant. When it had chewed off everything within\nreach, it climbed into the branches.\n\nThe little one twitched, moved a leg, and cautiously began dragging\nitself away. It rolled off the raised section and surprisingly made no\nnoise as it fell. It seemed to revive, shaking itself and scurrying\naway, still within range of the screen.\n\nAgainst the wall was a small platform. The little one climbed on top\nand there found something that seemed to interest it. It sniffed\naround and reached and felt the discovery. Wounds were forgotten as\nit snatched up the object and frisked back to the scene of its recent\ndefeat.\n\nThis time it had no trouble with the raised section. It leaped and\nlanded on top and made considerable noise in doing so. The big animal\nheard and twisted around. It saw and clambered down hastily, jumping\nthe last few feet. Squealing, it hit the floor and charged.\n\nThe small one stood still till the last instant--and then a paw\nflickered out and an inch-long knife blade plunged into the throat of\nthe charging creature. Red spurted out as the bigger beast screamed.\nThe knife flashed in and out until the big animal collapsed and stopped\nmoving.\n\nThe small creature removed the knife and wiped it on the pelt of its\nfoe. Then it scampered back to the platform on which the knife had been\nfound--_and laid it down_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt Halden's signal, the lights flared up and the screen became too\nbright for anything to be visible.\n\n\"Go in and get them,\" said Halden. \"We don't want the pests to find out\nthat the bodies aren't flesh.\"\n\n\"It was realistic enough,\" said Meredith as the crewmen shut off their\nmachines and went out. \"Do you think it will work?\"\n\n\"It might. We had an audience.\"\n\n\"Did we? I didn't notice.\" Meredith leaned back. \"Were the puppets\nexactly like the pests? And if not, will the pests be fooled?\"\n\n\"The electronic puppets were a good imitation, but the animals don't\nhave to identify them as their species. If they're smart enough,\nthey'll know the value of a knife, no matter who uses it.\"\n\n\"What if they're smarter? Suppose they know a knife can't be used by a\ncreature without real hands?\"\n\n\"That's part of our precautions. They'll never know until they try--and\nthey'll never get away from the trap to try.\"\n\n\"Very good. I never thought of that,\" said Meredith, coming closer. \"I\nlike the way your primitive mind works. At times I actually think of\nmarrying you.\"\n\n\"Primitive,\" he said, alternately frozen and thawed, though he knew\nthat, in relation to her, he was _not_ advanced.\n\n\"It's almost a curse, isn't it?\" She laughed and took the curse away by\nleaning provocatively against him. \"But barbaric lovers are often nice.\"\n\nHere we go again, he thought drearily, sliding his arm around her. To\nher, I'm merely a passionate savage.\n\nThey went to his cabin.\n\nShe sat down, smiling. Was she pretty? Maybe. For her own race, she\nwasn't tall, only by Terran standards. Her legs were disproportionately\nlong and well shaped and her face was somewhat bland and featureless,\nexcept for a thin, straight, short nose. It was her eyes that made\nthe difference, he decided. A notch or two up the scale of visual\ndevelopment, her eyes were larger and she could see an extra color on\nthe violet end of the spectrum.\n\nShe settled back and looked at him. \"It might be fun living with you on\nprimeval Earth.\"\n\nHe said nothing; she knew as well as he that Earth was as advanced as\nher own world. She had something else in mind.\n\n\"I don't think I will, though. We might have children.\"\n\n\"Would it be wrong?\" he asked. \"I'm as intelligent as you. We wouldn't\nhave subhuman monsters.\"\n\n\"It would be a step up--for you.\" Under her calm, there was tension.\nIt had been there as long as he'd known her, but it was closer to the\nsurface now. \"Do I have the right to condemn the unborn? Should I make\nthem start lower than I am?\"\n\nThe conflict was not new nor confined to them. In one form or another,\nit governed personal relations between races that were united against\nnon-humans, but held sharp distinctions themselves.\n\n\"I haven't asked you to marry me,\" he said bluntly.\n\n\"Because you're afraid I'd refuse.\"\n\nIt was true; no one asked a member of a higher race to enter a\npermanent union.\n\n\"Why did you ever have anything to do with me?\" demanded Halden.\n\n\"Love,\" she said gloomily. \"Physical attraction. But I can't let it\nlead me astray.\"\n\n\"Why not make a play for Kelburn? If you're going to be scientific\nabout it, he'd give you children of the higher type.\"\n\n\"Kelburn.\" It didn't sound like a name, the way she said it. \"I don't\nlike him and he wouldn't marry me.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't, but he'd give you children if you were humble enough.\nThere's a fifty per cent chance you might conceive.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe provocatively arched her back. Not even the women of Kelburn's race\nhad a body like hers and she knew it.\n\n\"Racially, there should be a chance,\" she said. \"Actually, Kelburn and\nI would be infertile.\"\n\n\"Can you be sure?\" he asked, knowing it was a poor attempt to act\nunconcerned.\n\n\"How can anyone be sure on a theoretical basis?\" she asked, an oblique\nsmile narrowing her eyes. \"I know we can't.\"\n\nHis face felt anesthetized. \"Did you have to tell me that?\"\n\nShe got up and came to him. She nuzzled against him and his reaction\nwas purely reflexive. His hand swung out and he could feel the flesh\ngive when his knuckles struck it.\n\nShe fell back and dazedly covered her face with her hand. When she took\nit away, blood spurted. She groped toward the mirror and stood in front\nof it. She wiped the blood off, examining her features carefully.\n\n\"You've broken my nose,\" she said factually. \"I'll have to stop the\nblood and pain.\"\n\nShe pushed her nose back into place and waggled it to make sure. She\nclosed her eyes and stood silent and motionless. Then she stepped back\nand looked at herself critically.\n\n\"It's set and partially knitted. I'll concentrate tonight and have it\nhealed by morning.\"\n\nShe felt in the cabinet and attached an invisible strip firmly across\nthe bridge. Then she came over to him.\n\n\"I wondered what you'd do. You didn't disappoint me.\"\n\nHe scowled miserably at her. Her face was almost plain and the bandage,\ninvisible or not, didn't improve her appearance any. How could he still\nfeel that attraction to her?\n\n\"Try Emmer,\" he suggested tiredly. \"He'll find you irresistible, and\nhe's even more savage than I am.\"\n\n\"Is he?\" She smiled enigmatically. \"Maybe, in a biological sense. Too\nmuch, though. You're just right.\"\n\nHe sat down on the bed. Again there was only one way of knowing what\nEmmer would do--and she knew. She had no concept of love outside of\nthe physical, to make use of her body so as to gain an advantage--what\nadvantage?--for the children she intended to have. Outside of that,\nnothing mattered, and for the sake of alloying the lower with the\nhigher, she was as cruel to herself as she was to him. And yet he\nwanted her.\n\n\"I do think I love you,\" she said. \"And if love's enough, I may marry\nyou in spite of everything. But you'll have to watch out whose children\nI have.\" She wriggled into his arms.\n\nThe racial disparity was great and she had provoked him, but it was not\ncompletely her fault. Besides....\n\nBesides what? She had a beautiful body that could bear superior\nchildren--and they might be his.\n\nHe twisted away. With those thoughts, he was as bad as she was. Were\nthey all that way, every one of them, crawling upward out of the slime\ntoward the highest goal they could conceive of? Climbing over--no,\n_through_--everybody they could coerce, seduce or marry--onward and\nupward. He raised his hand, but it was against himself that his anger\nwas turned.\n\n\"Careful of the nose,\" she said, pressing against him. \"You've already\nbroken it once.\"\n\nHe kissed her with sudden passion that even he knew was primitive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were no immediate results from the puppet performance and so\nit was repeated at intervals. After the third time, Firmon reported,\ncoming in as Halden pored over the meager biological data he'd gathered\non the unknown ancestor. Wild guesses mostly, not one real fact in all\nthe statistics. After two hundred thousand years, there wasn't much\nleft to work with.\n\nFirmon slouched down. \"It worked,\" he said. \"Got three a few hours ago.\"\n\nHalden looked at him; he had hoped it wouldn't work. There was\nsatisfaction in being right, but he would rather face something less\nintelligent. Wariness was one thing, the shyness and slyness of an\nunseen animal, but intelligence was more difficult to predict.\n\n\"Where are they?\" he asked.\n\n\"Did you want them?\" Firmon seemed surprised at the idea.\n\nHalden sighed; it was his own fault. Firmon had a potentially good\nmind, but he hadn't been trained to use it and that counted for more\nthan people thought. \"Any animal smart enough to appreciate the value\nof a knife is worth study on that account. That goes double when it's a\npest.\"\n\n\"I'll change the cremation setting,\" said Firmon. \"Next time, we'll\njust stun them.\"\n\nThe trap setting was changed and several animals were taken.\nPhysically, they were very much as Halden had described them to\nTaphetta, small four-legged creatures with fleshy antennae. Dissection\nrevealed a fairly large brain capacity, while behavior tests indicated\nan intelligence somewhat below what he had assumed. Still, it was more\nthan he wanted a pest to have, especially since it also had hands.\n\nThe biological mechanism of the hands was simple. It walked on the back\nof the front paws, on the fingers of which were fleshy pads. When it\nsat upright, as it often did, the flexibility of the wrists permitted\nthe forepaws to be used as hands. Clumsy, but because it had a thumb,\nit could handle such tools as a knife.\n\nHe had made an error there. He had guessed the intelligence, but he\nhadn't known it could use the weapon he had put within reach. A tiny\nthing with an inch-long knife was not much more dangerous than the\nanimal alone, but he didn't like the idea of it loose on the ship.\n\nThe metal knife would have to be replaced with something else.\nTechnicians could compound a plastic that would take a keen edge for a\nwhile and deteriorate to a soft mass in a matter of weeks. Meanwhile,\nhe had actually given the animal a dangerous weapon--the concept\nof a tool. There was only one way to take that away from them, by\nextermination. But that would have to wait.\n\nFortunately, the creature had a short life and a shorter breeding\nperiod. The actual replacement rate was almost negligible. In attaining\nintelligence, it had been short-changed in fertility and, as a\nconsequence, only in the specialized environment of this particular\nship was it any menace at all.\n\nThey were lucky; a slightly higher fertility and the thing could\nthreaten their existence. As it was, the ship would have to be\ndeverminized before it could land on an inhabited planet.\n\nHalden took the data to the Ribboneer pilot and, after some discussion,\nit was agreed that the plastic knife should supplant the metal one. It\nwas also decided to allow a few to escape with the weapon; there had\nto be some incentive if the creature was to visit the trap more than a\nfew times. Besides, with weapons there was always the chance of warfare\nbetween different groups. They might even exterminate each other.\n\nGradually, over a period of weeks, the damage to hydroponics subsided;\nthe pests were under control. There was nothing to worry about unless\nthey mutated again, which was unlikely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKelburn scowled at the pilot. \"Where are we now?\" he challenged, his\nface creased with suspicion.\n\n\"You have access to all the instruments, so you should know,\" said\nTaphetta. He was crouching and seemed about to spring, but he was\nmerely breathing relaxedly through a million air tubes.\n\n\"I do know. My calculations show one star as the most probable. We\nshould have reached it two days ago--and we're nowhere near it.\"\n\n\"True,\" admitted Taphetta. \"We're heading toward what you would\nconsider the fifth or sixth most likely star.\"\n\nKelburn caught the implication. They all did. \"Then you know where it\nis?\" he asked, suspicion vanishing.\n\n\"Not in the sense you're asking--no, I'm not sure it's what you're\nlooking for. But there was once a great civilization there.\"\n\n\"You knew this and didn't tell us?\"\n\n\"Why should I?\" Taphetta looked at him in mild astonishment.\n\"Before you hired me, I wouldn't tell you for obvious reasons. And\nafterward--well, you engaged all my skill and knowledge and I used them\nto bring you here by the shortest route. I didn't think it necessary to\ntell you until we actually arrived. Is that wrong?\"\n\nIt wasn't wrong; it merely illustrated the difference in the way an\nalien mind worked. Sooner or later, they would have found the place,\nbut he had saved them months.\n\n\"What's it like?\" Emmer asked.\n\nTaphetta jiggled his ribbons. \"I don't know. I was passing near here\nand saw the planet off to one side.\"\n\n\"And you didn't stop?\" Emmer was incredulous.\n\n\"Why should I? We're great navigators because we do so much of it. We\nwould never get very far if we stopped to examine everything that\nlooks interesting. Besides, it's not a good policy in a strange region,\nespecially with an unarmed ship.\"\n\nThey wouldn't have that problem. The ship was armed well enough to keep\noff uncivilized marauders who had very recently reached the spaceship\nage, and only such people were apt to be inhospitable.\n\n\"When will we land?\" asked Halden.\n\n\"In a few hours, but you can see the planet on our screens.\" Taphetta\nextended a head ribbon toward a knob and a planet came into view.\n\nThere weren't two civilizations in the Milky Way that built on such\na large scale, even from the distance that they could see it. Great,\ndistinctive cities were everywhere. There was no question as to what\nthey had found.\n\n\"Now you'll learn why they ran away,\" said Taphetta.\n\n\"A new theory,\" Kelburn said, though it wasn't, for they _had_ left.\n\"What makes you think they were afraid?\"\n\n\"No air. If your calculations are right, there must have been an\nextensive atmosphere a few hundred thousand years ago and now there\nisn't any. A planet this size doesn't lose air that fast. Therefore,\nit's an artificial condition. Who takes the trouble to leave a planet\nuninhabitable except someone who's afraid others will use it--and who\nelse runs away?\"\n\n\"They may have done it to preserve what they left,\" suggested Halden.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Taphetta, but it was obvious he didn't think so.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lack of air had one thing to recommend it--they needn't worry\nabout their pests escaping. The disadvantage was that they had to wear\nspacesuits. They landed on top of a great building that was intact\nafter thousands of years and still strong enough to support the added\nweight. And then--\n\nThen there was nothing.\n\nBuildings, an enormous number and variety of them, huge, not one of\nthem less than five stories high, all with ramps instead of stairs.\nThis was to be expected, considering the great size of the people who\nhad lived there, and it followed the familiar pattern.\n\nBut there was nothing in those buildings! On this airless world, there\nwas no decay, no rust or corrosion--_and nothing to decay or corrode_.\nNo pictures, tools, nothing that resembled sculpture, and while there\nwere places where machines had stood, none were there now. Here and\nthere in inaccessible locations were featureless blobs of metal. The\nimplication was clear: Where they hadn't been able to remove a\nmachine, they had melted in down on the spot.\n\nThe thoroughness was bewildering. It wasn't done by some enemy; he\nwould have stood off and razed the cities. But there was no rubble and\nthe buildings were empty. The inhabitants themselves had removed all\nthat was worth taking along.\n\nA whole people had packed and moved away, leaving behind only massive,\nechoing structures.\n\nThere was plenty to learn, but nothing to learn it from. Buildings can\nindicate only so much and then there must be something else--at least\nsome of the complex artifacts of a civilization--and there was none.\nOutside the cities, on the plains, there were the remains of plants\nand animals that indicated by their condition that airlessness had\ncome suddenly. Sam Halden, the biologist, had examined them, but he\ndiscovered no clues. The unknown ancestor was still a mystery.\n\nAnd the others--Emmer, the archeologist, and Meredith, the\nlinguist--had nothing to work on, though they searched. It was Kelburn\nwho found the first hint. Having no specific task, now that the planet\nwas located, he wandered around in a scout ship. On the other side\nof the planet, he signaled that there was a machine and that it was\nintact!\n\nThe crew was hurriedly recalled, the equipment brought back into the\nship, and they took off for the plain where Kelburn waited.\n\nAnd there was the machine, immense, like everything on the planet. It\nstood alone, tapering toward the sky. At the base was a door, which,\nwhen open, was big enough to permit a spaceship to enter easily--only\nit was closed.\n\nKelburn stood beside the towering entrance, a tiny figure in a\nspacesuit. He gazed up at it as the three came near. \"All we have to do\nis open it,\" he said.\n\n\"How?\" asked Meredith. She seemed to have forgotten that she disliked\nhim. He had made a chance discovery because he had nothing to do while\nthe others were busy, but she regarded it as further proof of his\nsuperiority.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was hard to watch the happiness that her face directed toward\nKelburn. Halden turned away.\n\n\"Just press the button,\" he said.\n\nEmmer noticed his expression. \"It's such a big button,\" he objected.\n\"It's going to be hard to know when we find it.\"\n\n\"There's an inscription of some sort,\" said Kelburn loftily. \"This\nthing was left for a purpose. Somewhere there must be operating\ninstructions.\"\n\n\"From here, it looks like a complex wave-form,\" a voice crinkled in\ntheir radio--Taphetta from the spaceship. \"All we have to do is to find\nthe right base in the electromagnetic spectrum and duplicate it on a\nbeam broadcast and the door should open. You're too close to see it as\nclearly as I can.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPerhaps they were too close to the big ancestor, decided Halden moodily\nas they went back. It had overshadowed much of their thinking, and who\nreally knew what the ancestor was like and what had motivated him?\n\nBut the Ribboneer was right about the signal, though it took several\ndays to locate it. And then the huge door swung open and air whistled\nout.\n\nInside was another disappointment, a bare hall with a ramp leading\nupward, closed off at the ceiling. They could have forced through, but\nthey had no desire to risk using a torch to penetrate the barrier--in\nview of the number of precautions they'd already encountered, it was\nlogical to assume that there were more waiting for them.\n\nIt was Emmer who found the solution. \"In appearance, it resembles a\nspaceship. Let's assume it is, minus engines. It was never intended to\nfly. Listen.\n\n\"There's no air, so you can't hear,\" said Emmer impatiently. \"But you\ncould if there were air. Put your hands against the wall.\"\n\nA distinct vibration ran through the whole structure. It hadn't been\nthere before the door opened. Some mechanism had been triggered. The\nrumbling went on, came to a stop, and began again. Was it some kind of\ncommunication?\n\nHastily rigged machines were hauled inside the chamber to generate\nan air supply so that sounds would be produced for the recorders.\nTranslating equipment was set up and focused and, after some\nexperimentation with signals, the door was slowly closed. No one\nremained inside; there was no guarantee that it would be as easy to get\nout as it had been to get in.\n\nThey waited a day and a half while the sounds were being recorded.\nThe delay seemed endless. The happiest of the crew was Kelburn.\nBiologically the highest human on the expedition, he was stimulated.\nHe wandered aimlessly and smiled affably, patting Meredith, when he\ncame to her, in the friendliest fashion. Startled, she smiled back and\nlooked around wanly. Halden was behind her.\n\nIf I had not been there, thought Halden--and thereafter made it a\npoint to be there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeredith was excited, but not precisely happy. The work was out of her\nhands until the translating equipment was retrieved. As the second\nhighest biological type, she, too, was affected, until she pointedly\nwent to her room and locked it from the inside.\n\nHalden kept himself awake with anti-fatigue pills, in part because\nMeredith could change her mind about Kelburn, and because of that\nlocked door.\n\nEmmer tried to be phlegmatic and seemed to succeed. Taphetta alone\nwas unconcerned; to him, it was an interesting and perhaps profitable\ndiscovery, but important only because of that. He would not be changed\nat all by whatever he learned.\n\nHours crawled by and at last the door opened; the air came rushing\nout again. The translating equipment was brought back to the ship and\nMeredith was left alone with it.\n\nIt was half a day before she admitted the others to the laboratory.\n\n\"The machine is still working,\" she said. \"There seems to have been\nsome attempt to make the message hard to decode. But the methods they\nused were exactly the clues that the machine needed to decipher it.\nMy function as a linguist was to help out with the interpretation of\nkey words and phrases. I haven't got even a little part of the message.\nYou'll know what it is as soon as I do. After the first part, the\ntranslator didn't seem to have much trouble.\"\n\nThey sat down facing it--Taphetta, Kelburn, Meredith, Halden and\nEmmer. Meredith was midway between Kelburn and himself. Was there any\nsignificance in that, wondered Halden, or was he reading more in her\nbehavior than was actually there?\n\n\"The translation is complete,\" announced the machine.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Meredith ordered.\n\n\"The words will be speeded up to human tempo,\" said the translator.\n\"Insofar as possible, speech mannerisms of the original will be\nimitated. Please remember that it is only an imitation, however.\"\n\nThe translator coughed, stuttered and began. \"We have purposely made\naccess to our records difficult. If you can translate this message,\nyou'll find, at the end, instructions for reaching the rest of our\nculture relics. As an advanced race, you're welcome to them. We've\nprovided a surprise for anyone else.\n\n\"For ourselves, there's nothing left but an orderly retreat to a place\nwhere we can expect to live in peace. That means leaving this Galaxy,\nbut because of our life span, we're capable of it and we won't be\nfollowed.\"\n\nTaphetta crinkled his ribbons in amusement. Kelburn frowned at the\ninterruption, but no one else paid any attention.\n\nThe translator went on. \"Our metabolic rate is the lowest of any\ncreature we know of. We live several thousand revolutions of any\nrecorded planet and our rate of increase is extremely low; under the\nmost favorable circumstances, we can do no more than double our numbers\nin two hundred generations.\"\n\n\"This doesn't sound as if they were masters of biological science,\"\nrustled Taphetta.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalden stirred uneasily. It wasn't turning out at all the way he had\nexpected.\n\n\"At the time we left,\" the message continued, \"we found no other\nintelligent race, though there were some capable of further evolution.\nPerhaps our scout ships long ago met your ancestors on some remote\nplanet. We were never very numerous, and because we move and multiply\nso slowly, we are in danger of being swept out of existence in the\nforeseeable future. We prefer to leave while we can. The reason we\nmust go developed on our own planet, deep beneath the cities, in the\nunderworks, which we had ceased to inspect because there was no need\nto. This part was built to last a million generations, which is long\neven for us.\"\n\nEmmer sat upright, annoyed at himself. \"Of course! There are always\nsewers and I didn't think of looking there!\"\n\n\"In the last several generations, we sent out four expeditions,\nleisurely trips because we then thought we had time to explore\nthoroughly. With this planet as base of operations, the successive\nexpeditions fanned out in four directions, to cover the most\nrepresentative territory.\"\n\nKelburn stiffened, mingled pride and chagrin on his face. His math\nhad been correct, as far as he had figured it. But had there been any\nreason to assume that they would confine their exploration to one\ndirection? No, they would want to cover the whole Milky Way.\n\nTaphetta paled. Four times as many humans to contend with! He hadn't\nmet the other three-fourths yet--and, for him, it wasn't at all a\npleasant thought.\n\n\"After long preparation, we sent several ships to settle one of the\nnearer planets that we'd selected on the first expedition. To our\ndismay, we found that the plague was there--though it hadn't been on\nour first visit!\"\n\nHalden frowned. They were proving themselves less and less expert\nbiologists. And this plague--there had to be a reason to leave, and\nsickness was as good as any--but unless he was mistaken, plague wasn't\nused in the strict semantic sense. It might be the fault of the\ntranslation.\n\n\"The colonists refused to settle; they came back at once and reported.\nWe sent out our fastest ships, heavily armed. We didn't have the time\nto retrace our path completely, for we'd stopped at innumerable places.\nWhat we did was to check a few planets, the outward and return parts\nof all four voyages. In every place, the plague was there, too, and we\nknew that we were responsible.\n\n\"We did what we could. Exhausting our nuclear armament, we obliterated\nthe nearest planets on each of the four spans of our journeys.\"\n\n\"I _wondered_ why the route came to an end,\" crinkled Taphetta, but\nthere was no comment, no answer.\n\n\"We reconstructed what had happened. For a long time, the plague had\nlived in our sewers, subsisting on wastes. At night, because they are\ntiny and move exceedingly fast, they were able to make their way into\nour ships and were aboard on every journey. We knew they were there,\nbut because they were so small, it was difficult to dislodge them from\ntheir nesting places. And so we tolerated their existence.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"They weren't so smart,\" said Taphetta. \"We figured out that angle long\nago. True, our ship is an exception, but we haven't landed anywhere,\nand won't until we deverminize it.\"\n\n\"We didn't guess that next to the hull in outer space and consequently\nexposed to hard radiation,\" the message went on, \"those tiny creatures\nwould mutate dangerously and escape to populate the planets we landed\non. They had always been loathsome little beasts that walked instead of\nrolling or creeping, but now they became even more vicious, spawning\nexplosively and fighting with the same incessant violence. They had\nalways harbored diseases which spread to us, but now they've become\nhot-houses for still smaller parasites that also are able to infect us.\nFinally, we are now allergic to them, and when they are within miles of\nus, it is agony to roll or creep.\"\n\nTaphetta looked around. \"Who would have thought it? You were completely\nmistaken as to your origin.\" Kelburn was staring vacantly ahead, but\ndidn't see a thing. Meredith was leaning against Halden; her eyes were\nclosed. \"The woman has finally chosen, now that she knows she was once\nvermin,\" clicked the Ribboneer. \"But there are tears in her eyes.\"\n\n\"The intelligence of the beast has advanced slightly, though there\nisn't much difference between the highest and the lowest--and we've\nchecked both ends of all four journeys. But before, it was relatively\ncalm and orderly. Now it is malignantly insane.\"\n\nTaphetta rattled his ribbons. \"Turn it off. You don't have to listen\nto this. We all are of some origin or other and it wasn't necessarily\npretty. This being was a slug of some kind--and are you now what it\ndescribes? Perhaps mentally a little, out of pride, but the pride was\nfalse.\"\n\n\"We can't demolish all the planets we unthinkingly let it loose on;\nthere are too many and it lives too fast. The stars drift and we\nwould lose some, and before we could eliminate the last one, it would\ndevelop space travel--it has little intelligence, but it could get that\nfar--and it would escape ahead of us. We know an impossible task when\nwe see it. And so we're leaving, first making sure that this animal\nwill never make use of the products of our civilization. It may reach\nthis planet, but it will not be able to untangle our code--it's too\nstupid. You who will have to face it, please forgive us. It's the only\nthing that we're ashamed of.\"\n\n\"Don't listen,\" said the Ribboneer and, bending his broad, thin body,\nhe sprang to the translator, shook it and banged with his ribbons until\nthe machine was silent. \"You don't have to tell anyone,\" crackled\nTaphetta. \"Don't worry about me--I won't repeat it.\" He looked around\nat the faces. \"But I can see that you will report to everyone exactly\nwhat you found. That pride you've developed--you'll need it.\"\n\nTaphetta sat on top of the machine, looking like nothing so much as a\nhuge fancy bow on a gift-wrapped package.\n\nThey noted the resemblance vaguely. But each of them knew that, as a\nmember of the most numerous race in the Milky Way, no longer feared\nfor their mysterious qualities--despised, instead--wherever they went,\nthere would never be any gifts for them--for any man.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Big Ancestor, by F.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
