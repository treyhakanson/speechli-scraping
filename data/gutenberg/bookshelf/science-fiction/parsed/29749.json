V. R. Francis, who lives in California and has\n    previously appeared in men's magazines, became 21 and sold to\n    FANTASTIC UNIVERSE all in the same week._\n\n\n       the\n    flying\n cuspidors\n\n _by ... V. R. Francis_\n\n\n This was love, and what could be done about it?\n It's been happening to guys for a long time, now.\n\n\nHotlips Grogan may not be as handsome and good-looking like me or as\nbrainy and intellectual, but in this fiscal year of 2056 he is the\ngonest trumpet-tooter this side of Alpha Centauri. You would know what I\nmean right off if you ever hear him give out with \"Stars Fell on Venus,\"\nor \"Martian Love Song,\" or \"Shine On, Harvest Luna.\" Believe me, it is\nout of this world. He is not only hot, he is radioactive. On a clear day\nhe is playing notes you cannot hear without you are wearing special\nequipment.\n\nThat is for a fact.\n\nMostly he is a good man--cool, solid, and in the warp. But one night he\nis playing strictly in three or four wrong keys.\n\nI am the ivory man for this elite bunch of musicians, and I am scooping\nup my three-dee music from the battered electronic eighty-eight when he\ncomes over looking plenty worried.\n\n\"Eddie,\" he says, \"I got a problem.\"\n\n\"You got a problem, all right,\" I tell him. \"You are not getting a job\nselling Venusian fish, the way you play today.\"\n\nHe frowns. \"It is pretty bad, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Bad is not the word,\" I say, but I spare his feelings and do not say\nthe word it is. \"What gives?\"\n\nHe looks around him, careful to see if anybody in the place is close\nenough to hear. But it is only afternoon rehearsal on the gambling ship\n_Saturn_, and the waiters are busy mopping up the floor and leaning on\ntheir long-handled sterilizers, and the boys in the band are picking up\ntheir music to go down to Earth to get some shut-eye or maybe an atomic\nbeer or two before we open that night.\n\nHotlips Grogan leans over and whispers in my ear. \"It is the thrush,\" he\nsays.\n\n\"The thrush?\" I say, loud, before he clamps one of his big hands over my\nkisser. \"The thrush,\" I say, softer; \"you mean the canary?\"\n\nHe waves his arms like a bird. \"Thrush, canary--I mean Stella\nStarlight.\"\n\nFor a minute I stand with my mouth open and think of this. Then I rubber\nfor the ninety-seventh time at the female warbler, who is standing\ntalking to Frankie, the band leader. She is a thrush new to the band and\nplenty cute--a blonde, with everything where it is supposed to be, and\nmaybe a little extra helping in a couple spots. I give her my usual\napproving once-over, just in case I miss something the last ninety-six\napproving once-overs I give her.\n\n\"What about her?\" I say.\n\n\"It is her fault I play like I do,\" Hotlips Grogan tells me sadly. \"Come\non. Leave us go guzzle a beer and I will tell you about it.\"\n\nJust then Frankie comes over, looking nasty like as usual, and he says\nto Grogan, \"You are not playing too well today, Hotlips. Maybe you hurt\nyour lip on a beer bottle, huh?\"\n\nAs usual also, his tone is pretty short on sweetness and light, and I do\nnot see why Grogan, who looks something like a gorilla's mother-in-law,\ntakes such guff from a beanpole like Frankie.\n\nBut Grogan only says, \"I think something is wrong with my trumpet. I\nhave it fixed before tonight.\"\n\nFrankie smirks. \"Do that,\" he says, looking like a grinning weasel. \"We\nwant you to play for dancing, not for calling in Martian moose.\"\n\nFrankie walks away, and Hotlips shrugs.\n\n\"Leave us get our beer,\" he says simply, and we go to the ferry.\n\nWe pile into the space-ferry with the other musicians and anyone else\nwho is going down to dirty old terra firma, and when everybody who is\ngoing aboard is aboard, the doors close, and the ferry drifts into\nspace. Hotlips and I find seats, and we look back at the gambling ship.\nIt is a thrill you do not get used to, no matter how many times you see\nit.\n\nThe sailor boys who build the _Saturn_--they give it the handle of\n_Satellite II_ then--would not know their baby now, Frankie does such a\ngood job of revamping it. Of course, it is not used as a gambling ship\nthen--at least not altogether, if you know what I mean. Way back in 1998\nwhen they get it in the sky, they are more interested in it being useful\nthan pretty; anybody that got nasty and unsanitary ideas just forgot\nthem when they saw that iron casket floating in a sky that could be\nfilled with hydrogen bombs or old laundry without so much as a four-bar\nintro as warning.\n\nFrankie buys _Satellite II_ at a war surplus sale when moon flights\nbecome as easy as commuters' trips, and he smoothes out its shape so it\nlooks like an egg and then puts a fin around it for ships to land on.\nAfter that, it does not take much imagination to call it the _Saturn_.\nThen he gets his Western Hemisphere license and opens for business.\n\nMy daydreaming stops, for suddenly Hotlips is grabbing my arm and\npointing out the window.\n\n\"What for are you grabbing my arm and waving your fist at the window,\nHotlips?\" I inquire politely of him.\n\n\"Eddie,\" he whispers, all nervous and excited from something, \"I see\none.\"\n\nI give him a blank stare. \"You see one what?\"\n\n\"One flying cuspidor,\" he says, his face serious. \"I see it hanging out\nthere by the _Saturn_ and then suddenly it is gone. Whoosh.\"\n\n\"Hallucination,\" I tell him. But I look out hard and try to see one too.\nI don't, so I figure maybe I am right, after all.\n\nI do not know about this \"men from space\" gimmick the science-fiction\npeople try to peddle, but lots of good substantial citizens see flying\ncuspidors and I think to myself that maybe there is something to it. So\nI keep looking back at the _Saturn_, but nothing unusual is going on\nthat I can see. My logic and super-salesmanship evidently convinces\nHotlips, for he does not say anything more about it.\n\nAnyway, in a few minutes we joggle to a stop at Earthport, pile out,\nwave our identification papers at the doorman with the lieutenant's\nbars, and then take off for the _Atomic Cafe_ a block away.\n\nEntering this gem of a drinking establishment, we make our way through\nthe smoke and noise to a quiet little corner table and give Mamie the\nhigh-sign for two beers. A few minutes later she comes bouncing over\nwith the order and a cheery word about how invigorating it is to see us\nhigh-class gentlemen instead of the bums that usually hang around a\njoint like this trying to make time with a nice girl like her.\n\n\"That is all very nice,\" I say to her politely, \"and we are overjoyed\nbeyond words to see you too, Mamie, but Hotlips and I have got strange\nand mysterious things to discuss, so I would appreciate it if you would\nsee us later instead of now.\" With this, I give her arm a playful pat,\nand she blushes and takes the hint.\n\nWhen we are alone, I ask Hotlips, now what is the trouble which he has.\n\n\"Like I tell you before,\" Hotlips says, \"I have a problem. So here it\nis.\" He takes a deep breath and lets fly all at once. \"I am in love of\nthe thrush, Stella Starlight.\"\n\nI am drinking my beer when he says this, and suddenly I get a snootful\nand start coughing, and he whams me on the back with his big paw so I\nstop, more in self-defense than in his curing me. Somehow, the idea of a\nbig bruiser like Hotlips Grogan in love of a sweet fluffy thing like\nStella Starlight seems funny.\n\n\"So?\" I say.\n\n\"So that is why I play so bad tonight,\" he says. Seeing I do not quite\ncatch on to the full intent of his remarks, he continues. \"I am a happy\nman, Eddie. I got my trumpet, a paid-for suit of clothes, a one-room\napartment with green wallpaper. Could a man ask for much more?\"\n\n\"Not unless he is greedy,\" I agree.\n\nHotlips Grogan is staring at his beer as though he sees a worm in it and\nlooking sadder than ever. \"It is a strange and funny thing,\" he says,\ndreamy-like. \"There she is singing, and there I am giving with the\ntrumpet, and all of a great big sudden--whammo!--it hits me, and I feel\na funny feeling in my stomach, like maybe it is full of supersuds or\nsomething, and my mouth is dry just like cotton candy.\"\n\n\"Indigestion,\" I suggest.\n\nHe shakes his big head. \"No,\" he says, \"it is worse than indigestion.\"\nHe points to his stomach and sighs. \"It is love.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" I say, happy it is not worse. \"All you got to do is tell her,\nget married and have lots and lots of kids.\"\n\nHotlips Grogan's big eyebrows play hopscotch around his button nose, so\nI can tell he does not think I solve all his troubles with my\nsuggestion.\n\n\"You are a good man, Eddie,\" he tells me, \"but you are too intellectual.\nThis is an affair of the heart.\" He sighs again. \"I am never in love of\na girl before,\" he goes on, more worried, \"and I do not know how to act.\nBesides, the thrush is with us only a day, and Frankie already is making\nwith the eyes.\"\n\n\"So what should I do, give you lessons?\" The idea is so laughable I\nlaugh at it. \"Anyway, Frankie always makes with the eyes at thrushes.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Hotlips Grogan admits, \"but never before have I been in love of\nany of the thrushes Frankie has made with the eyes at. Frankly, Eddie, I\nam worried like all get out about this.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I do not even understand the way you play even before the\nthrush comes, Hotlips,\" I admit. \"Like for instance yesterday when we\nplay 'A Spaceship Built for Two.' This is a song, as you know, that does\nnot have in it many high notes, but even when you play the low notes\nthey sound somewhat like they maybe are trying to be high notes. It is a\nmatter which is perplexing to one of my curious nature.\"\n\nHotlips looks sheepish for a minute and then he says, \"It is a physical\ndisability with me, Eddie. When I am young and practicing with my\ntrumpet one day, I have an accident and get my tongue caught in the\nmouthpiece, and it is necessary for the doctor to operate on my tongue\nand cut into it like maybe it is chopped liver.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear this, Hotlips,\" I say.\n\n\"I do not tell anyone this before, Eddie,\" Hotlips confesses. \"But\nafterward when I play the trumpet, I play two notes at one time, which\nat first is pretty embarrassing.\"\n\n\"This is great, Hotlips,\" I proclaim as a big idea hits me; \"you can\nplay your own harmony. With talent like that, and my brain--\"\n\nBut Hotlips is shaking his head. \"No, Eddie,\" he says. \"The other note\nis way off in the stratosphere someplace and no one can hear it, even\nwhen the melody note is low. And the higher the note is you can hear,\nthe higher the other note is you cannot hear. Besides, now I cannot even\nplay what I am supposed to play, what with the thrush around.\"\n\nI sit there with my beer in my hand and think about it for a while,\nwhile Hotlips looks at me like a lost sheepdog. I scratch my head but I\ndo not even come up with dandruff.\n\nFinally, I say, \"Well, thrush or not, if you play no better than you do\nthis afternoon, Frankie will make you walk back home without a\nspacesuit.\"\n\n\"That is for positive,\" Hotlips agrees sadly. \"So what can I do?\"\n\nI am forced to admit that I do not know just what Hotlips can do.\n\"However,\" I say, \"I have an idea.\" And I call Mamie over and tell her\nthe problem. \"So you are a woman and maybe you know what my musician\nfriend can do,\" I suggest.\n\nMamie sighs. \"I am at a loss for words concerning what your friend can\ndo, but I know just how he feels, for it is like that with me, too. I am\nin love of a handsome young musician who comes in here, but he does not\ntake notice of me, except to order some beer for him and his friend.\"\n\nI click my teeth sympathetically at this news.\n\n\"And I am too shy and dignified a girl to tell him,\" Mamie continues\nsadly. \"So you see I have the same problem as your friend and cannot\nhelp you.\"\n\n\"See,\" I whisper to Hotlips, \"it is perfectly normal.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he hisses back. \"But I am still miserable, and the only company I\ndesire is that of Stella Starlight.\"\n\n\"Maybe it really is your trumpet,\" I suggest, not very hopeful, though.\n\nHotlips shakes his head. \"Look,\" he says and takes the trumpet from his\ncase and puts it to his lips, \"and listen to this.\"\n\nInwardly, I quiver like all get out, because I figure that is just what\nthe management will tell us to do, once Hotlips lets go. Hotlips puffs\nout his cheeks and a soft note slides from the end of the trumpet--low,\nclear, and beautiful, without a waver in a spaceload. Only a few people\nclose by can hear the note and they do not pay us any attention, except\nto think that maybe we are a little nuttier than is normal for\nmusicians.\n\nFrom his first note, Hotlips shifts to a higher note which is just as\npretty. Then he goes on to another one and then to another, improvising\na melody I do not hear before and getting higher all the time. After a\nwhile I can hardly hear it, it is so high, but I can feel the glass in\nmy hand vibrating like it wants to get out on the floor and dance. I\nhold on to it with both hands, so my beer will not slosh over the side.\nThen there is no sound at all from the trumpet, but Hotlips' cheeks are\npuffed out and he is still blowing for all he is worth--which is plenty,\nif he can play like this when Stella Starlight is around.\n\nI tap Hotlips on the shoulder. \"Hotlips, that is all very well for any\nbats in the room which maybe can hear what you play, but--\" He does not\npay me any attention.\n\nSuddenly there is a large crinkle-crash of glass from the bar and a\nhoarse cry from the bartender as he sees his king-size mirror come down\nin little pieces. At the same time, glasses pop into fragments all over\nthe room and spill beer over the people holding them. Even my own glass\nbecomes nothing but ground glass and the beer sloshes over the table. At\nthe moment, however, I do not worry about that.\n\nThere are other things to worry about which are more important--like\nHotlips' and my health, for instance, which is not likely to be so good\nin the near future.\n\nLike I say, Hotlips does not play loud and it is noisy in the place, so\nthere are not too many who hear him. But they look around, all mad and\ncovered with beer, and see him there with the trumpet in his hand and a\nfunny look on his big face, and they put two and two together. I can see\nthey figure the answer is four. And what makes things worse, they are\nbetween us and the front door, so we cannot sneak past like maybe we are\njust tourists.\n\n\"Hotlips,\" I say to him, my voice not calm like is usual, \"I think it is\na grand and glorious idea that we desert here and take ourselves\nelsewhere.\"\n\nHotlips agrees. \"But where?\" he wants to know.\n\nI am forced to admit to myself that he comes up with a good question.\n\n\"Over here,\" Mamie said suddenly, and we look across the room to see\nher poking her nose through a side door.\n\nWe do not wait for a formal invite but zoom across the floor and through\nthe door into another, emptier room. Mamie slams the door and locks it\njust as two or three bodies thump into it like they mean business.\n\n\"The manager is out there and is not completely overjoyed with your\nactions of a short while ago,\" Mamie informs us, explaining, \"I\nrecognize the thump the character makes.\"\n\n\"Evidently,\" I surmise, \"he is in no mood to talk to concerning damages\nand how we can get out of paying them, so we will talk to him later\ninstead of now.\"\n\n\"See what I mean, though, Eddie,\" Hotlips says. \"I play fine when Stella\nStarlight is not in the place. Like I say, it is love and what can I do\nabout it.\"\n\n\"It is a problem,\" I say. \"Even if you _do_ play, you will no doubt be\nfired and cannot pay for the damages to the bar room and to the\ncustomers' clothing.\" Already there are holes in my plastic clothing\nwhere the beer splashes. \"If you can only give out on the _Saturn_ like\nyou play here,\" I sigh, \"we can break all records and show Frankie--\"\n\nSuddenly Mamie is tugging at my arm.\n\n\"Mamie,\" I inquire politely of her, \"why are you tugging at my arm?\"\n\n\"That is it,\" she informs me and leans forward and whispers in my ear.\n\n\"But--\" I say.\n\n\"Hurry,\" she says, pushing us out another door. \"You have only got this\nafternoon to do it.\"\n\n\"But--\" I say again, and Hotlips and I are in the alley looking at the\ndoor which Mamie closes in our face.\n\n\"What does Mamie say?\" Hotlips wants to know eagerly. \"Can she fix it up\nwith me and Stella Starlight?\"\n\nI scratch my head. \"That I do not know, Hotlips, but she does give me an\nidea which is so good I am surprised at myself I do not think of it\nalone.\"\n\nHotlips gives me a blank stare. \"Which is?\"\n\n\"Come on,\" I say mysteriously. \"You and me have got things to do.\"\n\nIt is hard to say who is more nervous that night, Hotlips or a certain\npiano player with my name. Frankie is smirking like always, and Stella\nStarlight is sitting and looking beautiful while she waits for her cue.\nHotlips is fumbling with his trumpet like maybe he never sees one\nbefore. And I--even I am not exactly calm like always.\n\nThe band begins to warm up, but we do not knock ourselves out because\nthere are still no customers to speak of. Frankie's license makes it\nplain that he has to stay over the western hemisphere so he has to wait\nuntil it gets dark enough there for the people to want to go\nnight-clubbing, even though it is not really night on the _Saturn_, or\nmorning or anything else.\n\nWe play along like always, and Hotlips has his trumpet pressed into his\nface, and nothing but beautiful sounds come from the band. I do not know\nif Frankie is altogether happy about this, for he does not like Hotlips\nand would like this chance to bounce him. But what surprises me most is\nthat the thrush, Stella Starlight, keeps looking back at Hotlips like\nshe notices him for the first time and is plenty worried by what she\nsees.\n\nWe have a short break after a while and I am telling Hotlips that the\nidea goes over real great, when Stella Starlight waltzes over. Hotlips'\nbig eyes bug out and I can see him shaking and covered with goosebumps.\n\n\"You do not play like that before, Hotlips,\" she coos. \"What did you\ndo?\"\n\nHotlips blushes and stammers, \"Eddie and I fix--\" But I give him a kick\nin his big shins before he gives the whole thing away.\n\n\"Hotlips does some practicing this afternoon,\" I tell her, \"to get his\nlip in shape for tonight.\"\n\nShe looks at me like she is looking through me, and then she turns back\nto Hotlips and says, soft and murmuring: \"Please do not play too high,\nHotlips. I am delicate and am disturbed by high sounds.\"\n\nShe waltzes away, and I scratch my head and try to figure out what this\npitch is for. Hotlips is not trying to figure out anything; he just sits\nthere looking like he has just got his trumpet out of hock for the last\ntime.\n\n\"Hotlips,\" I say to him.\n\n\"Go away, please, Eddie,\" he tells me. \"I am in heaven.\"\n\n\"You will be in the poorhouse or maybe even in jail if you tell somebody\nhow we fix your playing,\" I warn him.\n\n\"I still feel funny feelings though, Eddie,\" he tells me, frowning,\n\"like I cannot hit high notes now if I try.\"\n\n\"Then do not try,\" I advise. \"One problem at a time is too much.\"\n\nThere is a commotion at the entrance on the other side of the dance\nfloor, where some people all dressed up come in. A woman is holding her\nhead and moaning and threatening to faint all over the place.\n\nFrankie hurries over to us, running fidgety hands through his hair. \"For\ngoodness sake, play something,\" he almost begs.\n\n\"What gives?\" I inquire.\n\n\"Flying cuspidors,\" Frankie says in a frantic tone. \"They are all around\nthe place, like they are maybe mad at something, and a few minutes ago\nthey buzz the ferry and get the passengers all nervous and upset. If\nthey do that again, business will be bad; maybe even now it will be bad.\nPlay something!\"\n\nHe hops out in front with his baton and gives us a quick one-two, and we\nall swing into \"Space On My Hands,\" real loud so as to get people's\nminds off things which Frankie wants to get people's minds off of.\n\nStella Starlight gets up to sing, but she looks more like she would\nrather do something else. She stares at Hotlips and at the trumpet on\nhis lips and begins to quiver like she is about to do a dance.\n\nI remember she says she does not like high notes, and this song has some\npretty well up in the stratosphere, especially for the trumpet section,\nwhich is Hotlips.\n\nShe is frowning like maybe she is thinking real hard about something and\nis surprised her thoughts do no good. Her face becomes waxy and there is\na frightened look on it.\n\nShe quivers some more, as the notes go up and up and up. Then she lets\nout a shriek, like maybe she is going to pieces.\n\nAnd then she does. Actually.\n\nRight before our popping eyeballs she goes to pieces.\n\nAs each one in the band sees what is going on, he stops playing, until\nfinally Hotlips is the only one. But the trumpet is in Hotlips' hand,\nand the music is coming from the recording machine we place under his\nchair. The notes are clear and smooth, and you can almost feel the air\nshaking with them.\n\nBut nobody notices the music or where it comes from. They are too busy\nwatching the thrush, Stella Starlight.\n\nShe stands there, her face as white as clay, shaking like a carrot going\nthrough a mixmaster. And then tiny cracks appear on her face, on her\narms, even in her dress, and then a large one appears in her forehead\nand goes down through her body. She splits in the middle like a cracked\nwalnut, and there in the center, floating three feet from the floor is a\nsmall flying cuspidor.\n\nNobody in the room says anything. They just stand there, bug-eyed and\nfrightened like anything. Somewhere, across the room, a woman faints. I\ndo not feel too well myself, and I am afraid to look to see how Hotlips\ntakes this.\n\nThere is no sound, but I hear a voice in my mind and know that the\nothers hear it too. The voice sounds like it is filled with wire and\nmetal and is not exactly human. It says:\n\n\"_You win, Hotlips Grogan. I, as advance agent in disguise, tell you\nthis. We will go away and leave you and your people alone. We place a\nmental block in your mind, but you outsmart us, and now you know our\nweakness. We cannot stand high sounds which you can play so easy on your\ntrumpet. We find ourselves a home someplace else._\"\n\nWith that, the cuspidor shoots across the room and plows right through\nthe wall.\n\n\"That's the engine room!\" Frankie wails.\n\nThere is a sudden explosion from the other side of the wall, and\neverybody decides all at once they would like to be someplace else, and\nthey all pick the same spot. The space ferry is pretty crowded, but we\njam aboard it and drift away from the _Saturn_--musicians, waiters and\npaying customers all sitting in each other's laps.\n\nThe _Saturn_ is wobbling around, with flames shooting out at all angles,\nand Frankie is holding his head and moaning. In the distance, you can\njust about make out little specks of cuspidors heading for the wild\nblack yonder.\n\nSo all is well that ends well, and this is it.\n\nFrankie uses his insurance money to open a rest home on Mars for ailing\nmusicians.\n\nHotlips is all broken up, in a manner of speaking, over Stella\nStarlight's turning out to be not human, but he consoles himself with a\ngood job playing trumpet in a burlesque house where the girls wear\ncostumes made of glass and other brittle stuff.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs for me, Mamie gets me a job playing piano at the place where she\nworks, and everything is okay except for one thing. When Mamie is around\nI cannot seem to concentrate on my playing. I feel a funny feeling in my\nstomach, like maybe it is full of supersuds or something, and my mouth\nis dry like cotton candy.\n\nI think maybe it is indigestion.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ August 1958.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
